    , Accepted 11th August 2015First published on 11th August 2015AbstractIn this contribution, a novel cathode interlayer material (NDIO) based on naphthalene diimide was successfully prepared by a facile two-step reaction from commercially available compounds. NDIO exhibited excellent water solubility, high transparency in the visible light region, and well-matched molecular energy levels. By incorporating this novel water processed cathode interlayer, a high power conversion efficiency of 9.51% was recorded in PBDT-TS1/PC71BM-based polymer photovoltaic cells (PPCs), and the value is nearly 2-fold the device efficiency of PPCs without the cathode interlayer. More importantly, the insertion of the NDIO interlayer promotes the device efficiency of polymer/polymer photovoltaic cells based on PBDTTT-EFT/N2200 from 3.23% up to 5.77%. The successful applications in both polymer/PCBM and polymer/polymer blend-based inverted PPCs make NDIO a promising cathode interlayer for realizing aqueous processed polymer photovoltaic cells with high performance.
Introduction
In the past decade, much effort has been devoted to the study of bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) polymer photovoltaic cells (PPCs) considering their unique advantages of being low-cost, flexible, and colorful and their large-area fabrication capability.1,2 Conventional PPCs with the typical configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/photoactive layer/Ca/Al exhibited outstanding power conversion efficiencies (PCEs).3,4 Compared with the conventional PPC devices, inverted PPCs exhibit superior stability by using non-acidic anode interlayer transition metal oxides and air-stable anodes, such as Au or Ag, which can avoid the interfacial corrosion of the ITO electrode caused by PEDOT:PSS and the instability caused by low-work-function metals.5–9 A key component of high-performance inverted PPCs is the cathode interlayer, which effectively extracts electrons from the active layer and then transfers electrons into the indium tin oxide (ITO) electrode.6–13 Although the PCEs of inverted PPC devices can be greatly improved by advanced cathode interlayers, most of the reported cathode interlayers need to be fabricated in organic solvents like ethanol, methanol, etc., which may not fulfill the requirements of human health, environment, and low cost. Therefore, for the future commercialization of inverted PPCs, water processed cathode interlayers are intensely desired.
Recently, a variety of cathode interlayers based on polymer materials, for instance, PFN and its derivatives played important roles in achieving high performance inverted PPCs.9–13 Compared with the polymer cathode interlayers, small molecules exhibited the advantages of both easy preparation and precise molecular weight due to their well-defined structure and relatively small conjugated backbone.14,15 Naphthalene diimide (NDI) has attracted considerable attention of chemists and has been extensively used as a building block in small molecule acceptor materials16 due to its adjustable energy levels, high electron mobility and easy synthesis. Although NDI-based small molecule cathode interlayers have not been reported yet, NDI might be a good choice for constituting a novel small molecule cathode interlayer with excellent water solubility. In addition, most of the reported NDI derivatives can only be processed in organic solvents, which might be unfavorable for an economical and environmentally benign approach. Thus, the development of water-soluble naphthalene diimide materials acting as cathode interlayers for high-performance inverted PPCs will be desired for fundamental research and practical application.
Herein, we report the synthesis of a novel water-soluble small molecule named NDIO (as shown in Fig. 1a), and its application in inverted PPC devices as a novel cathode interlayer. The polar group of an amino N-oxide terminal substituent is introduced as the side-chain of NDIO, so that the novel cathode interlayer could be prepared in aqueous solution. Remarkably, after inserting NDIO as the cathode interlayer, the PBDT-TS1/PC71BM-based inverted PPC (Fig. 1b) showed a considerable PCE of 9.51% under AM 1.5G 100 mW cm−2 simulated solar light. Beyond its successful application in polymer:PC71BM-based PPCs, this cathode interlayer also works well in inverted polymer/polymer photovoltaic cells based on PBDTTT-EFT/N2200 blends, which afforded a high PCE of 5.77%. The water processing of NDIO is certainly beneficial to the low-cost and environmentally friendly manufacture of polymer photovoltaic cells.

Results and discussion
The synthetic routes of NDIO are demonstrated in Fig. 1a. The final amino N-oxide product NDIO was prepared by a simple two-step reaction from commercially available compounds, 1,4,5,8-naphthalenetetracarboxylic dianhydride and N,N-dimethyl-1,3-propane-diamine, with relatively high yield 75–80%. Owing to the polar N,N-dimethyl aminoxy end group, the compound NDIO is soluble in high polar organic solvents such as methanol and water, but insoluble in chlorinated solvents such as chlorobenzene and dichlorobenzene, so that the NDIO thin film is robust to support multi-layer solution processing. Moreover, the good solubility in water also endows NDIO with the potential of green manufacture, which should be of crucial significance for realizing the commercialization of PPCs. The chemical structure of NDIO was characterized by 1H NMR, 13C NMR and N-MALDI-TOF-MS (or ESI-MS). The thermal behaviour of the NDIO was evaluated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and the curve is shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†).

Fig. 1c shows the absorption spectrum of the NDIO in aqueous solution and the inset exhibits the transmittance spectrum of NDIO in solid thin film. The absorption band in the 300–400 nm range is typical for the NDI core and the polar amino N-oxide terminal group does not change the optical properties of the NDI core. As to solid film, the UV-vis absorption onset of NDIO film is around 410 nm, which minimizes the optical loss in the visible region as well as makes the cathode interlayer suitable in modifying the ITO electrode of an inverted PPC. Moreover, from the transmittance spectrum, we can figure out that the light transmittance of NDIO film is in the range of 97–100% throughout the whole visible light region. This superior light transmittance is helpful to contribute to efficient photon harvesting of the active layer, which is crucial for realizing high Jsc in the inverted device. In addition, the operational stability of PPCs could be improved by absorbing ultraviolet light, which usually gives rise to the photodegradation of organic materials.
To evaluate the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels, the electrochemical properties of NDIO were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV). The CV plot of NDIO is shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†). Considering that the energy level of ferrocene (Fc) is 4.80 eV below the vacuum level, the LUMO level of NDIO was estimated to be −3.98 eV. The HOMO level of NDIO was calculated to be −7.00 eV from the equation: ELUMO = EHOMO − Eoptg. As a result, the LUMO level of NDIO is suitable to collect electrons from the active layer and its HOMO level is deep enough to impede the hole carriers.
To investigate the effect of the electronic properties of the NDIO buffer layer on the photovoltaic performance, we carried out the ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) measurement to study the energy levels of bare ITO and ITO covered by NDIO thin film. Fig. 2a shows the inelastic secondary electron edge of the ITO (indium tin oxide) electrode with and without the NDIO film (the left panel) and the HOMO level region of ITO coated with and without NDIO thin film (the right panel). The work function (WF) value of ITO (4.49 eV) measured by UPS is consistent with the reported results. Upon modification by the NDIO thin film, the work function of the ITO electrode can be reduced to 3.96 eV. The HOMO level of NDIO was obtained according to the following equation: EHOMO = (hν − Eonset) + Ecutoff, where hν is the incident photon energy (hν = 21.22 eV) for He; Eonset is the onset value of the HOMO energy region as shown in the right panel; Ecutoff is defined as the inelastic secondary electron edge obtained from the left panel. Thus, the HOMO level of the NDIO buffer layer was −7.74 eV. The decrease of the ITO work function may be attributed to the molecular dipole of NDIO (Table S1, ESI†) formed at the interface between the NDIO cathode interlayer and ITO glass substrate. Fig. 2b shows the corresponding energy-level diagram of each component in the inverted device, indicative of WF modification by the NDIO interlayer. After modifying ITO with the NDIO interlayer, the mismatch between the WF of ITO and PC71BM (3.91 eV) became much smaller. In addition, NDIO owns a sufficiently deep HOMO level. This admirable energy alignment makes it an ideal candidate as a cathode interlayer to meet the requirements of extracting electrons and impeding holes.

PBDT-TS1, a newly designed photovoltaic polymer, exhibited excellent performance in the field of polymer photovoltaics due to the broad absorption, favorable molecular order, and high hole mobility.17 Herein, PBDT-TS1/PC71BM blend (Fig. 1b) is selected as a model photoactive material to evaluate the applicability of NDIO in high performance polymer/fullerene photovoltaic devices. Polymer/fullerene solar cells based on PBDT-TS1/PC71BM blends were made in an inverted device configuration using a transparent indium tin oxide (ITO)/cathode interlayer and reflective MoO3/Al electrodes to collect electrons and holes, respectively. The device with a configuration of ITO/photoactive layer/MoO3/Al was also fabricated as control. Fig. 3a shows the J–V curves of inverted devices with the NDIO cathode interlayer and without the cathode layer, and the detailed performance parameters are summarized in Table 1. The PPC device without a cathode interlayer only affords a moderate PCE of 5.14%. Impressively, the PCE of an inverted device with an NDIO buffer layer processed from aqueous solution reached 9.51% with a Voc of 0.79 V, a Jsc of 18.02 mA cm−2, and a FF of 66.82%. After modifying ITO with an NDIO cathode interlayer, enhancements of Voc, Jsc, and FF were simultaneously achieved, suggesting both an increased built-in field as a result of the interfacial dipole and a favorable electron transport due to the compatible organic–organic interface contact. Also, the device performance was investigated by the use of an NDIO interlayer processed from methanol, and a slightly higher PCE of 9.74% was obtained in PBDT-TS1/PC71BM based PPCs (see Table S2 and Fig. S3, ESI†). Compared with the NDIO processed from aqueous solution, no distinct enhancement in PCE was observed as processing with methanol. As reported previously, alcohol processed interlayers like ZnO,2a PDINO,14b,15 and PEIE11b performed well in polymer photovoltaic devices. We performed the PBDT-TS1/PCBM-based device using ZnO or PEIE instead of NDIO as the cathode interlayer, and the photovoltaic characteristics are listed in Table S3 and Fig. S4 (ESI†). It can be found that the PCE of a PBDT-TS1/PC71BM-based PPC device employing an NDIO cathode interlayer is quite comparable with that of the PPC device using a ZnO cathode interlayer (9.67%), and even slightly higher than that of the device with a PEIE cathode interlayer (9.32%). Apparently, the quality of NDIO film processed from water is comparable with film cast from methanol solution; this is favorable to green manufacture for PPC commercialization. The comparable performance and green manufacture in water render NDIO great potential in the practical application of inverted PPCs.

To understand the possible reasons for high photovoltaic performances of inverted PPCs, the J–V characteristics of inverted PPC devices with an NDIO cathode interlayer and without a cathode interlayer in the absence of illumination were performed. As can be seen from Fig. 3b, compared with the device without a cathode interlayer, the device modified with NDIO demonstrated an outstanding diode characteristic with lower leakage current, and higher rectification ratio (the quotient of current density at ±1.5 V), implying that the carrier recombination was suppressed by the NDIO cathode buffer layer. Generally, smaller series resistance (Rs) is favorable for improving photovoltaic parameters such as Jsc and FF. The increased Jsc and FF of the inverted device with an NDIO interlayer can be partially attributed to the decrease of series resistance from 7.62 Ω·cm2 for the control device to 4.19 Ω·cm2, indicating an improved ohmic contact. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the inverted device and the control device were also investigated, as shown in Fig. 3c. The PPC device modified with NDIO showed much higher EQE compared with the device without an cathode interlayer in the wavelength region from 600 to 800 nm. The calculated Jsc obtained by integration of the EQE curve for the PPC devices with an NDIO cathode interlayer and without a cathode interlayer was also consistent with the Jsc obtained from J–V characteristics.
To investigate the effect of the processing temperature on the NDIO layer, we put the ITO/NDIO substrate on a hot plate in a nitrogen-filled glove box to carry out thermal annealing treatment at 80, 100, 120, 140, 160, and 200 °C for 10 min, respectively. The detailed device PCEs are summarized in Fig. 3d. For the device without thermal annealing treatment on NDIO film, the PCE is 6.92%. When the NDIO interlayer was annealed at different temperatures (below 200 °C), all device PCEs were enhanced to some extent. As the annealing temperature of the NDIO layer increases from ambient temperature to 160 °C, the PCE increases from 6.92% to 9.51%. This is probably due to the fact that the thermal annealing process can remove the moisture in NDIO film, which improves the contact quality between the cathode interlayer and photoactive layer. However, when the annealing temperature increases up to 200 °C, the NDIO compound will decompose (verified by the TGA plot), which can destroy the film morphology so that the device performance drops to 6.03%. Therefore, the optimum annealing temperature of the NDIO interlayer is around 160 °C. The enhancement in Jsc of the inverted PPC device was investigated by varying the thickness of NDIO film atop the ITO glass substrate. Considering that the thickness of NDIO film was too thin to be measured, we went in the opposite direction by controlling the concentration of NDIO in water. With the NDIO concentration ranging from 3 mg mL−1 to 10 mg mL−1, the device PCE initially increases from 3 mg mL−1 to 8 mg mL−1 and then decreases with the increase of concentration (Fig. S5, ESI†). The optimal NDIO concentration is 8 mg mL−1 in water. When the concentration is too low, the NDIO layer may only partially cover the ITO surface so that the WF of ITO may not be well modified, resulting in poor ohmic contact with the active layer. When the NDIO layer is too thick theoretically, the NDIO film will hinder not only the absorption of incident light but also the electron extraction and collection of the cathode.
Thereafter, atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurement in tapping mode was carried out to probe the surface morphology of the optimum NDIO film on the ITO substrate. The AFM characterization of the bare ITO substrate was also performed as control. Fig. 4 shows the surface morphology of NDIO film with the control ITO glass. Apparently, the ITO glass covered by thin NDIO film exhibits much lower root-mean-square roughness (Rq = 2.09 nm) than the bare ITO (Rq = 3.33 nm). Clearly, the introduction of NDIO as the cathode interlayer can facilitate the contact quality with the PBDT-TS1:PC71BM active layer and decrease the contact resistance so as to improve charge collection effectively.

Recently, all polymer photovoltaic devices utilizing conjugated polymers as both donor and acceptor materials are attracting renewed attention and regarded as potential candidates to replace polymer/fullerene photovoltaic devices.18–22 Particularly, all polymer photovoltaic devices with considerable power conversion efficiencies in excess of 4% were achieved in several groups by the use of the high electron mobility polymer N2200 as acceptor material.21–25 To explore the potential of NDIO in other types of polymer photovoltaic devices, we further utilized this cathode interlayer in polymer/polymer photovoltaic devices, in which the PBDTTT-EFT/N2200 blend was selected as the photoactive layer (Fig. 5a). As shown in Fig. 5b, the polymer/polymer photovoltaic cell achieved simultaneously increased Voc (0.80 V vs. 0.66 V), Jsc (13.81 mA cm−2vs. 11.34 mA cm−2), and FF (52.22% vs. 43.19%), which lead to an ∼80% enhancement in the overall device efficiency. Therefore, the aforementioned results demonstrated that the NDIO cathode interlayer shows great potentials and excellent applicability in two types of inverted PPCs, i.e., polymer/PCBM and polymer/polymer photovoltaic devices.

Fabrication of inverted polymer/PCBM photovoltaic cells
The inverted PPCs were fabricated with the structure of glass/ITO/NDIO/photoactive layer/MoO3/Al. The NDIO solution was spin-coated at 3000 rpm for 60 s on the pre-cleaned ITO electrode. Next, the NDIO film was baked at 160 °C for 10 min. A solution containing a mixture of PBDT-TS1/PC71BM (1:1.5 wt/wt) in chlorobenzene with a total concentration of 25 mg mL−1 was prepared and stirred for several hours for complete dissolution. The additives (3 vol% DIO) were added to the blend solution before spin-coating. Then the blend solution was spin-coated on top of the NDIO layer to produce a 100 nm-thick active layer. After that, the substrate was transferred to a vacuum chamber and a 10 nm MoO3 layer was thermally deposited atop the photoactive layer under a shadow mask in a base pressure of ca. 3 × 10−4 Pa. Finally, a 100 nm Al layer was thermally deposited on the top of MoO3 layer in a vacuum. The deposition of ZnO and the PEIE layer follows previous reports by Yang et al.2a and Zhou et al.,11b respectively.
Fabrication of inverted polymer/polymer photovoltaic cells
The preparation method of devices is identical to that of polymer:PCBM devices besides the photoactive layer. The blend solution containing a mixture of PBDTTT-EFT/N2200 (1:1 wt/wt) with a total concentration of 10 mg mL−1 in chlorobenzene was spin-coated at 2000 rpm for 60 s, and the processing additive was not introduced at all.23
Conclusions
In this study, a novel water-soluble naphthalene diimide derivative NDIO was designed, synthesized, and utilized as a cathode interlayer by aqueous solution processing for inverted PPC devices. NDIO thin film meets the four requirements for an efficient cathode interlayer: (1) high transparency for minimizing the loss of incident photons; (2) a suitable work-function for efficient electron collection; (3) low roughness for excellent interface contact; and (4) easily processed by water. The photovoltaic performance of inverted PPC devices showed a significant increase by utilizing the NDIO interlayer due to the superior ability of NDIO in regulating the work function of the ITO electrode. Based on spin-coating of NDIO film from aqueous solution, a considerable PCE of over 9.5% was achieved in an inverted PPC based on PBDT-TS1/PC71BM. Simultaneous improvements in the Jsc, Voc and FF values resulted in a PCE enhancement from 5.33% to 9.51% in polymer/PCBM photovoltaic cells and from 3.23% to 5.77% in polymer/polymer photovoltaic cells with the insertion of NDIO as the cathode interlayer. Both the significant enhancements of PCE values and the green manufacture in water render the naphthalene diimide derivative NDIO great potential in the practical application of inverted PPCs. Integrating the green processing of both photoactive layers28 and interlayers, green and high efficiency polymer photovoltaic cells will soon be achieved.
