1. Introduction
With the advancement of industrialization and the acceleration of urbanization, energy shortages and environmental pollution have become increasingly prominent. To alleviate the threat of these two crises, it is urgent to seek environmentally friendly technologies to improve the poor living conditions of human beings. Currently, great efforts are being made to develop clean and sustainable energy and the treatment of environmental pollution.1–8 As is widely known, the harnessing of solar energy to convert chemical fuels and degrade pollutants has been extensively studied in recent decades. Among existing light-energy utilization technologies, visible-light-driven semiconductor photocatalysis has been considered to be an important method for overcoming the challenges of both environmental pollution and global energy shortage. Semiconductor photocatalysis technology can convert solar energy into valuable chemicals, such as hydrogen production from water splitting,9–11 degradation of harmful pollutants,12–14 carbon dioxide reduction to chemical fuels,15–17 and the organic synthesis of hydrocarbon.18–20
Since the first report on photoelectrochemical water splitting using TiO2 electrodes,21 the field of artificial photosynthesis has been systematically studied. This includes analyzing the basic photocatalytic mechanism, building excellent semiconductor photocatalysts, and constructing efficient photocatalytic systems. Generally, the fundamental photocatalytic processes can be summarized as follows: when these photocatalysts are excited under light with its energy larger than or equal to their band-gaps, the photoinduced electrons jump from the valence band (VB) to the conduction band (CB), and the corresponding holes appear in the valence band.22–24 Thus, the redox reaction involved in photocatalysis is carried out using these separated electron–hole pairs. On the basis of understanding the above mechanism, various kinds of semiconductor photocatalysts have been rationally designed, including sulfides (CdS, MoS2, ZnS, etc.),25–29 carbides (C3N4, rGO, MoC, etc.),30–34 oxides (Ga2O3, WO3, CeO2, etc.),35–39 and perovskite materials (MAPbI3, CsPbBr3, Cs3Bi2I9, etc.).40–46
Among the considered species, perovskite materials (PMs refer in particular to metal halide perovskites) are identified as the most promising photocatalysts, enabled by their fascinating physical and chemical properties. In recent years, some reviews have discussed the progress in the specific photocatalytic field using a single type of PM,47–52 such as water-splitting using organic–inorganic hybrid PMs, degradation of dye molecules employing halide PMs, organic synthesis utilizing lead-halide PMs, and CO2 reduction using all-inorganic PMs. However, there are few review papers on the comprehensive research and discussion about various PMs in the application of photocatalysis.
The general formula of PMs is ABX3,53–55 where the A site is usually occupied by a cation; the B site by a divalent oxidation state metal ion of IVA; and the X site by a halogen anion. Benefiting from their simple synthesis method and composition engineering,56–62 strong visible-light-harvesting capacity,63–65 tunable band-gap,66–68 long charge-carrier diffusion length,69–72 low trap densities,73–75 high charge carrier mobility,76–78 and appropriate band edge positions,79 PMs have been highlighted as a potential semiconductor photocatalyst.80–85 However, the formation enthalpy of PMs is relatively low, making them vulnerable to structural damage under the interference of external conditions,86–91 such as oxygen, polar solvent, high-temperature environment, and others. This instability seriously limits the wide application of PMs. In order to overcome this shortcoming, several substantial protection methods have been reported for different components of perovskites to achieve their long-term photocatalytic stability.92–101 These protection methods are mainly divided into three categories: constructing PM-based heterojunctions, PM surface encapsulation, and building PMs' saturated solution systems (placing PMs in a saturated halide acid aqueous solution to prevent their decomposition). For example, by employing a NiOx/FAPbBr3/TiO2 heterojunction a high conversion efficiency of selective C–H bond functionalization under ambient conditions can be obtained.102 As another classic example, a Ni-layer passivated hybrid perovskite photoanode is designed and shows excellent photoelectrochemical water splitting performance.103 And as we all know, PMs are not stable in polar solvents because they are easily decomposed into methylammonium cations, inorganic halide salts, etc. (for example, MAPbI3 → MAI + PbI2).88–90 However, by utilizing the dynamic equilibrium of the dissolution and precipitation of perovskite MAPbI3 in saturated hydrogen iodide (HI) aqueous solutions, MAPbI3 unexpectedly presents efficient photocatalytic HI splitting.104 Despite many advances, this field is still in the initial research stage. Therefore, there are significant challenges in the design of target reaction systems and improving the stability and efficiency of halide perovskites for use in various areas of industrial photocatalysis in the future.
This work is focused on the applications of PMs in four aspects of photocatalysis: photoelectrochemical water splitting, CO2 reduction reaction, photodegradation of pollutants, and organic compound synthesis. The overall structure of the text is shown in Scheme 1. Specifically, in Section 1, the basic physical and chemical properties of PMs are briefly presented. In Section 2, the recent development of applications of PM-based heterostructures as high-efficiency photocatalysts in different photocatalytic applications is discussed, according to their research classification in the photocatalytic field: hybrid organic–inorganic perovskites, followed by all-inorganic perovskites, and lead-free perovskites, respectively. In Section 3, the specific challenges and development directions are put forward, which provides guidance for the industrialization of PM photocatalysis applications.

2. The structure and properties of perovskite materials
2.1. The structure of perovskite materials
As a new material in the solar cell field, perovskites have attracted considerable attention due to their excellent properties. As an academic term, “perovskite” represents a crystal structure that shares the common chemical formula of ABX3,105 where A is a monovalent cation, like, methylammonium (MA),106 formamidinium (FA),107 Rb+, or Cs+; B is a divalent metal cation, like Pb2+ or Sn2+; and X is a halogen anion, like, Cl−, Br− or I−.108 The crystal structure of the perovskite is shown in Fig. 1a, where [BX6]4− extends in three dimensions with corner-sharing, and the A group is surrounded by eight [BX6]4− octahedra. The properties of perovskite materials can be adjusted by controlling the cations and anions in the perovskite crystals. In general, Goldschmidt's tolerance factor (t) has been used to predict the stability of the perovskite structure. , where rA, rB and rX stand for the radius of the A cation, B cation and anion, respectively.109 For example, to obtain a photo-active black perovskite phase, the t usually ranged from 0.8 to 1.0 according to empirical measures for lattice distortion.109,110Fig. 1b presents the relationship between the tolerance factor and the radius of the A cation. Only three kinds of cations, Cs, MA and FA, are located in the region of an established category of perovskites. Interestingly, the radius of other cations is too small (Na, K, and Rb) or too large (imidazolium, ethylamine, and guanidinium) to form a stabilized perovskite structure. Fig. 1c displays the calculated t in the range of 0.8–1 for a series of metal halide PMs, which shows a typical perovskite feature.111

(d) Conduction and valence band positions of perovskite materials with the relative potential in photocatalytic applications.124–138 
Similarly, the anion also affects the prosperity of perovskites, especially in the conduction and valence band positions (Fig. 1d). The bandgap would increase as the anion change from iodide ions to chloride ions. For example, the bandgap of MAPbI3, MAPbBr3, and MAPbCl3 is about 1.6, 2.4, and 3.2 eV, respectively.112 Thanks to this property of a tunable bandgap, PMs have been widely used in many different application scenarios. In addition, the simple solution processing of perovskite materials is another advantage. And the perovskite crystal/film is synthesized through a low-temperature solution process.113–115 For example, the precursor solution of MAPbI3 can transform into the perovskite phase at room temperature.116 At an annealing temperature of around 100 °C, the corresponding device shows better performance.117–119 This property greatly reduces the steps and costs in the fabricating process. According to experimental requirements, perovskite materials can be prepared into different shapes and sizes. Perovskite quantum dots,120 nanowires,121 single crystals,122 and polycrystal thin films123 have also been synthesized and applied in photoelectrical and photocatalytic fields.
2.2. The category and properties of perovskite materials
In the following part, we will first provide some background information about different PMs. Based on the group of cations, PMs are divided into hybrid organic and inorganic PMs, like MAPbI3, FAPbI3, MAFAPbI3, and MAFACsPbI3, and all-inorganic PMs, like CsPbI3 and CsPbBr3, and lead-free PMs, like CsSnI3, Cs2BiAgBr6, and AgBi2I7.139–143 In PMs, the influence of cations on the band structure is slight. However, their size and charge compensation with PbI6 octahedra are important to stabilize the perovskite crystal structure.144 In other words, choosing different cations can balance the stability issue and power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PMs.
MAPbI3 is a very common PM used in perovskite solar cells due to its high PCE, but the inferior stability of MAPbI3 is very undesirable. This compound will quickly decompose in the presence of H2O and O2.145,146 What is worse, MAPbI3 will also degenerate under continuous light illumination and high temperatures (>150 °C).147,148 To solve the instability problem, researchers tried to use different cations (FA+ and Cs+) to substitute MA+. As mentioned earlier, FAPbI3 as a possible substitution has attracted significant attention. Pure FAPbI3 shows a smaller bandgap (1.47 eV)149 than pure MAPbI3 (1.58 eV),150 which is favorable for a high PCE according to the Shockley–Queisser limit.151 Moreover, FAPbI3 can stand higher temperatures than MAPbI3.149,152 Unfortunately, the FA+ cation with a too large ionic radius introduces another problem: pure FAPbI3 at room temperature does not form a stable photo-active phase.153–155 As a result, researchers have to add small size MA+ or Cs+ to balance the phase stability.156–159
The stability of inorganic PMs is usually better than that of hybrid organic and inorganic PMs. For instance, the vast temperature difference between MABr (onset 200 °C) and CsBr (650 °C) evaporation/decomposition results in the differences of the associated perovskites.160,161 However, the larger bandgap of inorganic PMs, reducing the absorption range of the solar spectrum, limits its application in solar cells. Now, a perovskite solar cell with high PCE usually possesses triple-cation-based PMs as the active layer.162 In the photocatalysis field, the first thing to consider is that the perovskite's energy level position can trigger the redox reaction of the reactant. The larger bandgap is no longer a shortcoming. In contrast, the stability issue is more critical in the photocatalytic process because PMs should directly interact with the reactant or media. Wide bandgap perovskite materials have more significant application potential in the field of photocatalysis.
Another class of PMs are lead-free perovskites, which means that the Pb2+ cation is substituted by Sn2+, Ge2+, Mg2+, Mn2+, or other divalent metal cations.124,163–165 Although the performance of lead PMs in solar cells surpasses that of lead-free PMs, the toxicity of lead is an inevitable issue, hindering the industrialization of PM-based devices. According to the requirements of environmental protection, designing lead-free PMs deserve more attention. Since the radius of Sn2+ (1.35 Å) is similar to that of Pb2+ (1.49 Å),166 Sn-based PMs have been investigated extensively. Some properties of Sn-based PMs are even better than those of lead-based PMs, such as a narrow bandgap167 and high carrier mobility. Unfortunately, the stability issue hampers its application because Sn2+ is easily oxidized to Sn4+ under ambient conditions.168 To overcome the above problem, adding additives, like, SnI2, SnF2, SnCl2, and even metal Sn to the precursor can suppress the oxidation of Sn2+.169 Of course, there are many kinds of lead-free materials, such as germanium (Ge)-based PMs170 and binary-based PMs. Due to their instability and inferior properties, here we will not introduce them one by one.
Considering different design principles in the actual application, we will discuss how the properties of PMs enable device design and the advantages/disadvantages of PMs in the field of solar cells, water splitting, and other photocatalysis.
In the field of solar cells, the PCE of perovskite solar cells has reached up to 25.5%,171 which is comparable to that of silicon solar cells. The high absorption coefficient can make the perovskite absorb enough sunlight at a thickness of a few hundred nanometers. The efficient separation of the photogenerated exciton is ascribed to the lower exciton binding energy. Due to the lower Coulomb effect in the exciton, the electric field force provided by the planar heterojunction is enough to achieve efficient separation. Therefore, perovskite solar cells usually adopt a planar heterojunction structure. To allow the active layer to absorb the light spectrum in a broader range, perovskite/silicon and perovskite/perovskite tandem solar cells are also designed. This design principle is based on the fact that the materials could only absorb the spectrum corresponding to their highest IPCE. Now the PCE of perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells has reached up to 29.05%.172 Advantageously, such a value is higher than the PCE of any single material. Under the guidance of this concept, the PCE of future perovskite solar cells is expected to be further improved. Although perovskite solar cells (PSCs) show many advantages, PMs quickly tend to decompose in water and oxygen environments. Thus, this inferior stability severely limited their commercial application. Although this issue can be resolved by advanced encapsulation, the shortcoming of crystal phase instability under high temperature and illumination still needs to be overcome. Recently researchers have provided some strategies to improve the stability of PMs, such as developing two-dimensional (2D) perovskites,173 interface engendering, and surface-defect passivation.
In the area of photocatalytic water splitting, PMs play several roles. Firstly, they act as an external power supply. Secondly, they directly participate in the water-splitting reaction without other devices' help. In the first case, the design principle is similar to the one used for solar cells. The primary purpose is to convert solar energy to hydrogen energy as extensively as possible. Then the electrons/holes are transported to the working electrode through an external circuit. The advantage of the design is that the perovskite material does not come into direct contact with water or other electrolytes. Therefore, this ingeniously avoids the unstable characteristics of PMs. In the second case, the minimum theoretical bandgap of PMs is 1.23 eV to overcome the net Gibbs free energy as a suitable catalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) or oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in photocatalytic water splitting. Since an overpotential is needed in practice, the bandgap at least reaches 1.8 eV to drive the photocatalytic process.174 As for the HER, the bottom of the conducting band should be more negative than the reduction potential of H+/H2 (0 V vs. the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE)).175 For the OER, the top of the valence band is more positive than the oxidation potential of O2/H2O (1.23 V vs. NHE).176 It is best to meet the above two conditions at the same time to achieve overall water splitting. However, the perovskite material used in solar cells with a relatively narrow bandgap is not optimal for water splitting. For example, the valence band potential of MAPbI3 (Eg ≈ 1.6 eV) is 1 V vs. NHE, which cannot be used for the photocatalytic OER.177 Fortunately, the bandgap can be adjusted by changing the anion of the perovskite material. The PMs with Br−/Cl− as the anion have been applied in water splitting.178,179 The bandgap of PMs can be tuned by changing the mixed halides, which is the advantage of PMs compared with traditional inorganic materials.
In the field of CO2 reduction, degradation of organic dyes/wastewater and photosynthesis, the basic work mechanism is the efficient absorption of solar energy, promotion of the separation of photogenerated charge carriers, suppression of the recombination, transportation of the charge carriers to the surface, and oxidation/reduction of the related reactants. As shown in Fig. 1d, PMs can also provide suitable band positions for photocatalytic applications. However, there have been few reports about PMs in photocatalysis to date.180–182 It is meaningful to study these experimental phenomena and principles in depth. Combining with the excellent properties of PMs, this direction will get more attention and achieve considerable progress.
3. Application of perovskite photocatalysis
Numerous studies have reported the photocatalytic performances of PMs with specific nanostructures, such as 0-dimensional quantum dots (QDs), 1-dimensional nanowires (NWs), thin films, heterojunctions, and hybrid device structures (as shown in the insets at the edges of Scheme 2). Besides, different compositions of PMs have different effects on photocatalytic characteristics. Therefore, exploring the inherent relationship between the structures of PMs and their corresponding photocatalytic performance is important to improve PMs' potential application in photocatalysis.
 Scheme 2  Schematic illustration of the mechanisms of photocatalytic applications based on perovskite materials and structures. 
As mentioned in Section 2, the structural instability and low separation efficiency of electron–hole pairs have forced PMs to appear in the form of perovskite-based multicomponent composite materials in photocatalytic systems. Considering PM-based heterojunction nanocomposites as an example, the fundamental photocatalytic mechanisms can be summarized as follows: as shown in the inset in the middle of Scheme 2, upon light irradiation, the excited charge carriers in PMs quickly diffuse from the CB and VB to reactive sites through electron and hole transfer layer materials in the well-designed band alignment nanocomposites. After that, the electrons can immediately participate in the photocatalytic reduction reaction, such as H2 evolution from water splitting and the reduction of CO2 to CH4, CO, CH3OH, etc. Meanwhile, the accumulated holes can participate in oxidation reactions, such as the degradation of pollutant molecules (dyes and antibiotics) into water and carbon dioxide, and the synthesis of high-value chemicals by C–H activation, C–C coupling, and so on. Thermodynamically, the reduction process requires the electron potential to be more negative than the reduction potential of H2O/H2 as well as CO2/CO, and the hole potential must be more positive than the oxidation potential of pollutants/H2O and CO2 as well as the activation of C–H or C–C bonds. The efficiency of all kinds of photocatalytic performances is influenced by different compositions of PMs and PM-based nanocomposites. In detail, different PMs and PM-based nanocomposite photocatalysts for water splitting, CO2 reduction, pollutant degradation, photocatalytic synthesis will be discussed below.
3.1. Water splitting
Due to the great photoelectric transformability of lead halide PMs, Minh Tam Hoang used perovskite MAPbI3 with an n-i-p structure in solar cells as a photoanode to carry out overall water splitting.183Fig. 2a shows the schematic of the perovskite photoanode, which can be directly used for the photocatalytic OER, and the photoelectron can be transformed from the ETL to the Pt counter electrode for the HER. As shown in Fig. 2b, the J–V curves exhibit a higher photocurrent of 17.4 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V with the Ni catalyst layer than the bare perovskite photoanode and pure Ni layer. The inset in Fig. 2b shows the O2 bubbles emerging quickly from the active region of the perovskite anode under light illumination. However, the perovskite anodes are inevitably damaged by the presence of water or other electrolytes. Therefore, it is important to fabricate a protection layer for improving the stability of the perovskite anode. Herein, to protect the perovskite anode from being corroded by the electrolyte, SeongSik Nam fabricates a Field's metal and Ni layer with a lift-off process to encapsulate the perovskite photoanodes, which assist the photoanodes in the exhibition of long-term photocatalytic stability in alkaline electrolytes.184 Isabella Poli also used a commercial thermal graphite sheet and a mesoporous carbon scaffold to prevent inorganic perovskite CsPbBr3-based photoanode degradation in aqueous electrolytes. She recorded stability for 30 h in an aqueous electrolyte under solar illumination, with currents above 2 mA cm−2 at 1.23 VRHE.185 Besides, conductive carbon paste and silver conductive paint can also serve a waterproof function in an organolead halide perovskite (5-AVA)x(MA)1−xPbI3 photoanode, resulting in stability for more than 48 h in an alkaline electrolyte and a remarkable photocurrent density of 12.4 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V.186

Owing to the perovskite anode operation in a severely oxidative environment, which can reduce the stability of the perovskite-based photoanode, the perovskite photocathode can also be fabricated for H2 evolution. Fig. 2c shows the p-type-intrinsic-n-type (p-i-n) structure of FTO/PEDOT:PSS/organolead halide perovskite MAPbI3/PCBM/PEIE:Ag with an extra metal-encapsulating layer of Field's metal and Pt served as a photocathode for solar-driven H2 evolution in water.187 Moreover, the perovskite MAPbI3 cathode can provide a more moderate reductive environment with H2 evolution from the perovskite photoelectrode side, which can retain more than 80% of their initial photocurrent (9.8 mA cm−2) for 1 h. In order to further improve the properties and stability of the perovskite MAPbI3-based photocathode, a new zwitterion (L-proline) passivation material and a eutectic gallium indium alloy (EGaIn) encapsulated method was introduced by Ju-Hyeon Kim, as shown in Fig. 2d. The perovskite photocathode is composed of glass substrate/ITO/PTAA/PFN-Br/perovskite MAPbI3/PC60BM/BCP/Cu, which exhibits a remarkable average photocurrent density of 21.2 mA cm−2 and the highest stability for over 54 hours under continuous light illumination.188 Besides, a H2ase combined triple cation mixed halide (CsFAMA) perovskite photocathode has also been constructed for photocatalytic water splitting, which displays an H2 production yield of 258 ± 55 μmol cm−2 in 12 h and the hydrogenase exhibits a turnover number of 1.9 × 106189.66 Combining the perovskite-based photocathode and photoanode together, Hongjun Chen constructed a monolithic architecture consisting of two encapsulated perovskite (FA0.80MA0.15Cs0.05PbI2.55Br0.45) solar cells with low-cost earth-abundant CoP for the HER and FeNi(OH)x for the OER, respectively, achieving an overall solar-to-hydrogen efficiency of 8.54% and good stability over 20 h.190
In addition to the application in photoelectrochemical devices, PMs can also be directly used in the HER. Similar to the effect of using protective layers, PMs can exist stably in their corresponding saturated aqueous, such as HX solution. This can not only ensure their structural stability but also make them effectively split HX into H2 under visible-light irradiation. Herein, Sunghak Park replaced water with saturated hydrogen iodide (HI) solution, as shown in Fig. 3a. When the perovskite MAPbI3 dissolves in the saturated solution, MAPbI3 can be decomposed into MA+ cations and PbI3− anions. Meanwhile, MA+ and PbI3− can reversely form MAPbI3 crystals, which indicates that the decomposition and formation of MAPbI3 in the solution have reached dynamic equilibrium. Fig. 3b shows the CB minimum (−0.6 V) and VB maximum (0.93 V) of MAPbI3 powder, which can induce photocatalytic HI splitting efficiently (0.81%).104 To improve the photocatalytic HER efficiency, Guan fabricated a MoS2 nanoflowers/MAPbI3 heterostructure. The corresponding schematic band diagram is shown in Fig. 3c.191 Under solar-light irradiation, the photogenerated electrons can transfer from perovskite MAPbI3 to MoS2 to participate in the HER, which can significantly enhance the HI splitting efficiency to 7.35%. Interestingly, the H2 evolution rate of the MoS2/MAPbI3 heterostructure (30000 μmol g−1 h−1) is more than 1000-fold higher than that of bare MAPbI3 microcrystals (Fig. 3d). This excellent photocatalytic H2 evolution activity can be attributed to the moderate band alignment and unsaturated species of MoS2, which can efficiently promote the charge separation efficiency and provide more active sites for the HER, respectively. By comparison, further research found that MoS2 materials show a better co-catalytic effect than reduced graphene oxide (RGO),192 Ta2O5,193 N3C,177 or other metal cocatalysts194–196 in perovskite-based photocatalysts. Moreover, Hong Wang also reported that the photocatalytic HER efficiency of 2D perovskite phenylmethylammonium lead iodide (1.57%) is higher than that of the 3D counterparts.197 As shown in Fig. 3e, the photogenerated electrons and holes are easily separated and participate in the redox reaction of HI. Fig. 3f also shows that 2D perovskite PMA2PbI4 incorporated 2 wt% Pt has the best H2 evolution rate (333 μmol h−1), indicating that the metal decoration method is an efficient way of improving the photocatalytic HER.

Although lead-based PMs display high photocatalytic H2 evolution performance, the lead toxicity and structural instability of lead-based perovskites are still not well resolved. Given this knotty issue, it is imperative to design lead-free PMs. For instance, Wang et al. fabricated lead-free double perovskite Cs2AgBiBr6 particles for H2 evolution in a saturated HBr aqueous solution. However, the H2 evolution rate is only 0.61 μmol g−1 h−1, indicating the poor activity of the perovskite Cs2AgBiBr6. Interestingly, when the perovskite Cs2AgBiBr6 is combined with reduced RGO, the H2 evolution rate increased to 48.9 μmol g−1 h−1, which could be ascribed to the facilitated charge separation and transfer by RGO.198 Based on this study, Jiang et al. synthesized nitrogen-doped carbon (N–C) materials to decorate lead-free halide perovskite Cs2AgBiBr6, and the optimal photocatalytic H2 evolution rate can be promoted to 380 μmol g−1 h−1 under visible light irradiation, which is about 19 times and 80 times higher than that of pure Cs2AgBiBr6 and Cs2AgBiBr6/RGO composites, respectively.199 Moreover, by replacing traditional protonated countercations with alkylated countercations in a Bi-based hybrid system, a zero-dimensional perovskite (3-ethylbenzo[d]thiazol-3-ium)4Bi2I10 was grown, exhibiting excellent stability in photocatalytic H2 evolution.200 These studies illustrate that lead-free PMs are promising candidates for photocatalytic H2 generation with a moderate heterostructure constructed. To see the difference more intuitively in photocatalytic H2 evolution with these diverse PMs, the reported test conditions and performances of PMs for water splitting with different compositions or structures are summarized in Table 1. Clearly, standard test conditions should be established for evaluating photocatalytic performances with different PMs. And the stability of PMs also needs to be improved with further work.

3.2. CO2 reduction
The inorganic perovskite CsPbBr3 was first introduced as a photocatalyst for CO2 reduction in 2017 when most studies of CsPbBr3 application focused on lasers or photodetectors. Hou et al. carried out CO2 reduction with CsPbBr3 quantum dots (QDs) in an ethyl acetate/H2O solution. As shown in Fig. 4a, the production rates of CO, CH4, and H2 all almost linearly increase with the increase of reaction time. The corresponding production rates are 4.3, 1.5, and 0.1 μmol g−1 h−1, respectively.201 Thus, the selectivity of CO2 reduction is approximately 100%, which can be calculated from the equation: selectivity = (2RCO + 8RCH4)/Relectron × 100%. Considering that graphene oxide (GO) has a more positive Fermi level than CsPbBr3, Xu et al. constructed a CsPbBr3 QDs/GO nanocomposite to drive CO2 reduction, firstly with the solvent of ethyl acetate.202 The schematic diagram of CsPbBr3 QDs/GO for CO2 reduction is shown in Fig. 4b. Clearly, graphene provides an additional carrier-transfer path for CO2 reduction, resulting in the fast separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs, thus increasing the electron consumption rate to 29.8 μmol g−1 h−1(Fig. 4c). This study indicates that some low-dimensional materials like graphene can also be employed to improve the photocatalytic CO2 reduction performance of perovskite CsPbBr3.

To explore the solutions to improve the catalytic capability of the perovskite CsPbBr3, Tang et al. adopted density functional theory (DFT) to study the CO2 reduction processes of pristine CsPbBr3, Co-doped, and Fe-doped CsPbBr3 catalysts, respectively.203Fig. 4d shows that Co-doped CsPbBr3 has the smallest free energy barrier (0.68 eV) during the CO2 reduction processes, which is just half that of pristine CsPbBr3, indicating Co-doped CsPbBr3 can reduce the photoreaction barrier. Furthermore, the metal atom dopants can also enhance light absorption and facilitate electron transfer, boosting the photocatalytic selectivity toward CH4 production. Meanwhile, the Fe-doped CsPbBr3 nanocrystals (NCs) induce predominated CH4 evolution in the photoreduction of CO2.204 Dong et al. also fabricated Co-doped CsPbBr3/Cs4PbBr6 nanocomposites, and the yields of the CO product can be increased from 678 μmol g−1 to 1835 μmol g−1 under 15 h of illumination (Fig. 4e).205 This high photocatalytic efficiency can also be attributed to the use of methanol as a sacrificial reagent, which accelerates the hole oxidation of methanol to the high-value-added product of formic acid and simultaneously inhibits the recombination of electron–hole pairs. Meanwhile, the Cs4PbBr6 matrix can improve the stability of the perovskite CsPbBr3 in the aqueous solution. Fig. 4f shows that the stability of perovskite CsPbBr3 NCs in the water reaction system shows a noticeable improvement after coating with a thin layer of graphdiyne, which can not only accelerate the transport of the photogenerated holes from CsPbBr3 NCs but also enhance the metal active sites and improves the chemisorption of CO2.206
Considering that organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite MAPbBr3 materials have comparable optoelectronic properties to CsPbBr3, Fu et al. predicted that hybrid organic–inorganic perovskites can serve as substrates for Pt single-atom catalysts with first-principles calculations.207 The surface iodide anions can provide uniform anchoring sites for donating electrons to the Pt single atom. In addition, Wang et al. used the perovskite MAPbBr3 coupled with graphene oxide (GO) as a catalyst for converting CO2 to CO. GO can not only protect the MAPbBr3 QDs from erosion in tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate–propylene carbonate solution but also enhance the separation rate of photoinduced electrons and holes, yielding CO up to 1.05 μmol cm−2 h−1 under solar irradiation.208Fig. 5a displays the corresponding mechanism of photocatalytic CO2 reduction using GO/MAPbBr3 QDs. Here the photoexcited electrons from MAPbBr3 QDs are quickly transferred to GO, and then those CO2 molecules adsorbed on the surface of GO are reduced to CO or CH4 effectively. Moreover, Wu et al. improved the stability of organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite MAPbI3 QDs by encapsulating them in the pores of metal–organic framework PCN-211 based Fe–porphyrin.94 The synthesis diagram of the perovskite-based MAPbI3@PCN-211(Fex) photocatalyst is shown in Fig. 5b. The MAPbI3@PCN-211(Fex) compounds show superior photocatalytic CO2 reduction activity, possessing a high CO and CH4 yield of 1559 μmol g−1 under 80 h illumination. This is nearly 40 times higher than that of bare PCN-211(Fex). Such a high conversion efficiency can be attributed to the broad light harvest of the perovskite MAPbI3 QDs. To improve the redox ability of PMs, Huang et al. constructed a Z-scheme heterojunction photocatalytic system from the perovskite formamidinium lead bromide and bismuth tungstate (FAPbBr3/Bi2WO6). It displays near 100% selectively for photoreduction of CO2 to CO and photooxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde, simultaneously.209 The corresponding photocatalytic mechanism is shown in Fig. 5c. And the whole photocatalytic process can be summarized as follows: CO2 + C6H5CH2OH → CO + C6H5CHO + H2O. Fig. 5d shows that the maximal CO evolution rate is 170 μmol g−1 h−1, nearly two orders of magnitude larger than that of an inorganic perovskite CsPbBr3 based Z-scheme photocatalyst.210Fig. 5e also shows a benzaldehyde generation rate as large as 250 μmol g−1 h−1. This indicates that PMs are used for efficient CO2 reduction and offer a new path toward oxidization for value-added products. Moreover, Chen et al. developed a perovskite MAPbI3 photovoltaic structure (FTO/PTAA/MAPbI3/C60-BCP/Cu/In0.4Bi0.6) as a photocathode for converting CO2 to value-added HCOOH, achieving an electrocatalytic efficiency of 7.2% under photo-assistance (AM 1.5G solar light illumination).211

Although the above-mentioned lead halide perovskite nanomaterials have demonstrated a high yield for CO2 reduction, the toxicity of lead severely restricts their commercial application. Herein, a series of lead-free halide PMs have been fabricated for photocatalytic CO2 reduction. Zhou et al. synthesized lead-free double perovskite Cs2AgBiBr6 NCs, which shows remarkable stability in polar solutions and under continuous light illumination and high-temperature conditions.212Fig. 6a shows that the as-prepared Cs2AgBiBr6 NCs have a suitable CB to drive the reduction of CO2 to CO and CH4. As shown in Fig. 6b, the washed Cs2AgBiBr6 NCs promote the evolution of CO and CH4 to 14.1 and 9.6 μmol g−1, achieving a total electron consumption of 105 μmol g−1 under light illumination of 6 h. Besides, the single perovskite Cs2SnI6 seems to be simpler than the double perovskite Cs2AgBiBr6. Wang et al. in situ constructed a perovskite nanocrystal Cs2SnI6/SnS2 nanosheet heterojunction, as shown in Fig. 6c.213 Moreover, the Cs2SnI6 NCs embedding in the SnS2 crystal lattice form an intimate contact interface between Cs2SnI6 and SnS2, promoting the photoexcited hole transport from SnS2 to Cs2SnI6 and the photoexcited electron transfer from Cs2SnI6 to SnS2. Therefore, the photocatalytic activity of Cs2SnI6/SnS2 reaches 6.09 μmol g−1, and a 5.4-fold enhancement in the photoreduction of CO2 to CH4, compared with pristine SnS2 (Fig. 6d). Replacing the Sn atom with the bismuth atom, Bhosale et al. adopted a top-down ultrasonic method to synthesize a series of A3Bi2I9 perovskite NCs, where A+ represents Rb+, Cs+ or MA+ (Fig. 6e).214Fig. 6f demonstrates that the perovskite Cs3Bi2I9 NCs have the best photocatalytic reduction activity of CO2 to CO (77.6 μmol g−1) and CH4 (14.9 μmol g−1) among the synthesized Rb3Bi2I9 NCs, MA3Bi2I9 NCs, and commercial TiO2 (P25) catalysts. To achieve high selectivity for CO2 reduction using Bi-based perovskite catalysts, Sheng et al. expanded the perovskite Cs3Bi2I9 NCs to Cs3Bi2Cl9 QDs and Cs3Bi2Br9 QDs, which exhibit 98.7% selectivity for CO2 reduction to CO with 134.76 μmol g−1 yields. This high conversion efficiency is because the Br element can narrow the bandgap, suppress the charge carrier recombination, and alter the absorption and activation mode of CO2 effectively.215

From the results mentioned above and the summarized photocatalytic CO2 reduction parameters in Table 2, one can see that there are significant achievements in the field of photocatalytic CO2 reduction with perovskite-based catalytic nanomaterials. However, compared with the photocatalytic activity for CO2 reduction over the three main types of PMs, we find that organic–inorganic perovskite FAPbBr3-based materials show better performance than inorganic CsPbBr3-based perovskite and lead-free based PMs. This phenomenon is due to the moderate bandgap of the perovskite FAPbBr3 and the designed Z-scheme structure, despite that CsPbBr3 PMs have been studied four years into the field of CO2 reduction with the optimization of material performance and photocatalyst structure. Lead-free PMs are the last ones used for CO2 conversion, and the maximum reduction product evolution rate is 26.95 μmol g−1 h−1,215 which can be comparable to metal-doped CsPbBr3 nanocomposites.205 Considering the high stability and environment-friendly lead-free PMs, we believe that for future applications the lead-free perovskite is the most promising in the commercialization of photocatalytic CO2 reduction among the three main PMs. Moreover, we find that in the process of studying CO2 reduction, the activity of catalysts is obtained under different experimental conditions, such as different light power densities, illumination times, and the light wavelength range. In such a case, it is difficult to evaluate the activity of different photocatalytic PMs. Thus, it is urgent to establish uniform test conditions to ensure the comparability of test results.

3.3. Pollutant degradation
Considering the excellent photoelectron chemical properties of PMs, Gao et al. firstly introduced CsPbCl3 and CsPbBr3 QDs for the photocatalytic degradation of methyl orange under visible light illumination.217Fig. 7a shows that yellow colored methyl orange is gradually degraded to small transparent fragments and environmentally friendly substances using CsPbCl3 QDs within only 80 min. This high photocatalytic activity can be ascribed to photocatalytic active species ˙O2− and ˙OH, which are obtained by photoexcited electron reduction of O2 and hole oxidation of H2O, respectively. The proposed photocatalytic degradation mechanism of methyl orange with CsPbX3 QDs is displayed in Fig. 7b. Except for the common organic dye-pollutants, the antibiotic residues of tetracycline hydrochloride in the organic system and carcinogen of 2-mercaptobenzothiazole can also be degraded effectively with CsPbBr3 QDs.218,219 In general, constructed heterostructures can improve the stability and electron–hole separation rate in the photocatalytic reaction. Thus, Zhao et al. fabricated type I CsPbBr3/carbon nitride (CN) and type II CsPbCl3/CN heterostructures. Interestingly, both of them exhibit outstanding photocatalytic performance toward penicillin 6-aminopenicillanic acid degradation.220 As shown in Fig. 7c, the type I heterostructure of CsPbBr3/CN could transfer photogenerated electrons from the CB of CN to CsPbBr3, while photogenerated holes could be transferred from the VB of CN to CsPbBr3. However, when it comes to the type II heterostructure of CsPbCl3/CN, photoinduced holes could be transferred from the VB of CsPbCl3 to CN since the VB potential of CsPbCl3 is more positive than that of CN, as shown in Fig. 7d.220 Moreover, a ternary assembly with an Ag–CsPbBr3/C3N4 heterostructure has also been constructed to enhance the photocatalytic activity of 7-aminocephalosporanic acid degradation.221 Although perovskite CsPbBr3-based photocatalysts show excellent photocatalytic activity in organic pollutant degradation, the toxicity of lead in the inorganic perovskite cannot be neglected. Therefore, Zhang et al. used lead-free double perovskite Cs2AgBiBr6 particles to degrade dye molecules. The photocatalytic degradation rate of Cs2AgBiBr6 on rhodamine B is comparable to that of CdS under the same conditions. As shown in Fig. 7e, the corresponding absorption peak intensity of rhodamine B decreases to nearly zero with continuous light irradiation over 120 min and the color of rhodamine B gradually changes from magenta to colorless. Importantly, Fig. 7f displays the Cs2AgBiBr6 particles decorated with a metal (Pt and Au) that can improve the photocatalytic efficiency of rhodamine B degradation compared with bare Cs2AgBiBr6. This effect is due to the deposition of metal centers that can promote the separation and transformation of photogenerated carrier. Besides, rhodamine 110, methyl red and methyl orange dyes can also be degraded by Cs2AgBiBr6 particles despite the photocatalytic rates being slower than that of rhodamine B.222

Although perovskite-based photocatalysts show high photocatalytic degradation activity for organic pollutants, inorganic–organic and lead-free PMs with high light absorption capacity are rarely used in photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants (Table 3). This shows the necessity of systematic and in-depth research of such processes. We are pretty optimistic that among all of these perovskite photocatalysts, the applications of lead-free perovskites such as Rb3Bi2I9, Cs3Bi2I9, Cs3Bi2Cl9 QDs, Cs3Bi2Br9,etc. in photocatalytic degradation will increase because of their low toxicity and high potential catalytic properties. Likewise, to evaluate the photocatalytic degradation efficiency of different perovskite photocatalysts, standard test conditions should also be developed and applied.

3.4. Photocatalytic synthesis
Since organic synthesis mainly depends on charge separation and transfer, PMs can also be used in photocatalytic organic synthesis. Huang et al. reported that formamidinium lead bromide (FAPbBr3) perovskites show highly efficient and selective photocatalytic oxidation of benzylic alcohols to aldehydes in 2018.225 As shown in Fig. 8a, benefitting from the relative band alignment of photogenerated charge carriers, the 15%-FAPbBr3/TiO2 hybrid displayed the highest photocatalytic conversion efficiency, which provides more than 4-fold enhancement compared with pure FAPbBr3. The proposed photocatalytic mechanism is depicted in Fig. 8b, the photoelectrons transformed from FAPbBr3 to TiO2 can reduce the O2 molecules to ˙O2− species. Meanwhile, the photogenerated holes remaining in FAPbBr3 can oxidize the benzylic alcohol to R–CH2OH*+. Thus, the product of aldehydes is synthesized by the reaction of ˙O2− species with R–CH2OH*+ carbocations. The product of conducting poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene), PEDOT, can also be obtained by photocatalytic polymerization of 2,2′,5′,2′′-ter-3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene with inorganic cesium lead iodide perovskite quantum dots (CsPbI3 QDs) under visible-light illumination.226Fig. 8c displays the corresponding photocatalytic polymerization processes of 2,2′,5′,2′′-ter-3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene by CsPbI3 QDs: the photoinduced holes can oxidize 2,2′,5′,2′′-ter-3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene to polymeric PEDOT, which can in turn encapsulate and stabilize the morphology of the CsPbI3 QDs. Substituting the iodine with bromine, the perovskite CsPbBr3 NCs were used for photocatalytic coupling of organic thiols into symmetric and unsymmetrical disulfides227 and highly selective photocatalytic α-alkylation to aldehydes.228 Moreover, Zhu et al. further extended the application of perovskite CsPbBr3 NCs to fundamental photocatalytic organic synthesis reactions, such as the formation of C–C, C–N and C–O bonds.229Fig. 8d demonstrates the driving force of different photocatalytic organic reactions with CsPbBr3 NCs. The bandgap of CsPbBr3 can be tuned by compositional engineering to meet the redox potential required by different organic compounds. Therefore, employing PMs with an appropriate bandgap width can activate C–H to form a C–C bond, and N-heterocyclization and aryl-esterification to form C–N and C–O bonds. The ultrafast charge transfer (∼50 ps) from photoexcited perovskite NCs to reactant molecules for organic products leads to C–C bond formation in a biradical pathway with photogenerated charged radical intermediates, but does not allow the chain to propagate.230

Reproduced with permission from ref. 231, copyright 2020, Wiley. 
In addition to applying lead-containing perovskites in photocatalytic organic synthesis, lead-free and air-stable Cs3Bi2Br9 halide perovskites can also be used for the photocatalysis of organic reactions. In Fig. 8e, lead-free Cs3Bi2Br9 halide perovskites integrated within mesoporous SBA-15 silica demonstrate the highest conversion rate, which can reach up to 32900 μmol gcat−1 h−1 with excellent selectivity (>99%). This indicates that the lead-free perovskite Cs3Bi2Br9 can effectively oxidize hydrocarbons to aldehydes and ketones under visible-light irradiation.231 As shown in Fig. 8f, the benzaldehyde production rate continued to increase in the first 4 hour reaction and then gradually decreased during the second 4 hour process. The catalytic reaction finally stopped during the third 4 hour stage, which illustrated that the Cs3Bi2Br9 catalyst showed negligible structural destruction during the long-time reaction under visible light irradiation. However, the stability of the Cs3Bi2Br9/SBA-15 photocatalysts can be enhanced by adding anhydrous Na2SO4 at the beginning of the photocatalytic reaction (the green bar in Fig. 7f). Furthermore, the lead-free perovskite Cs3Bi2Br9 photocatalyst can also exhibit high selectivity (≥86%) for photocatalytic conversion of epoxide alcoholysis to β-alkoxy alcohols and thia-compounds under visible-light irradiation in an ambient environment.232 And the mainly involved photocatalytic synthesis reaction and performance parameters based on PMs are summarized in Table 4. PM photocatalysts exhibit a high conversion rate and selectivity in these organic synthesis reactions.

4. Current challenges and future prospects
Up to now, the existing progress on the application of PMs in the field of photocatalysis has been very encouraging. Nevertheless, from a long-term perspective, the research in the area is only in the initial stage. There are just a few systematic and comprehensive studies of this subject, compared with those on traditional chalcogenide and oxide photocatalysts. As a prospect, we summarize the current challenges related to this issue and the corresponding solutions as follows:
(1) Although the corresponding mechanism of PMs for photocatalysis has been extensively studied, the specific redox pathway is still unclear. More theoretical support and experimental verification are needed to determine the redox details involved in the photocatalytic process. Given these shortcomings, it is necessary to establish a complete theoretical model to explain the high catalytic activity of PMs in the photocatalytic process. Meanwhile, the carrier dynamics of PMs in an actual photocatalytic process should be in situ analyzed using advanced characterization techniques.
(2) To improve the photocatalytic activity, the structural improvement of PMs themselves is quite important. Usually, the structural design involves many aspects, such as changes in composition, exposure to high-activity surfaces, morphology modification, etc. Specifically, in terms of composition changes of ABX3 PMs, the introduction of alternative organic/inorganic ions such as FA+, PEA+, Ce3+/4+, and Sn2+/4+ into PMs should be attempted. As for high-activity surfaces, in the process of perovskite synthesis, some surfactants should be added purposefully to make those highly active faces preferentially grow. These highly active faces can promote the adsorption of reaction substrates and the desorption of products, thereby increasing the rate of redox reactions. As another aspect of morphology modification, for different catalytic systems, PMs with different morphologies (such as quantum dots, nanowires, nanosheets, and nanoflowers) can be selected to maximize their improvements.
(3) On the basis of ensuring the photocatalytic activity of PMs, the structural and chemical stability must also be resolved. The first consideration should be given to the development of new perovskite protective layers or ligands to form a core–shell structure. In addition to blocking the contact between PMs and polar molecules, the protective layer should also act as an electron donor or conduction electron ligand for PMs. The second focus involves the development of stable cocatalysts to form multiple heterojunctions that match the energy bands of perovskites. These cocatalysts, transition metals, transition metal sulfides, transition metal phosphates, MXenes, etc., should be able to form stable chemical bonds or built-in electric fields at the interface of heterojunctions. The third focus comprises building various precipitation–solubility equilibrium systems between perovskites and soluble ionic species. For example, MAPbI3 has high efficiency and stable photocatalytic HER performance in a saturated HI aqueous solution due to the dynamic balance between them.104 Similarly, such a system should be extended to other applications besides the photolytic HER. If the stability of the perovskite in these reactions could be guaranteed, it seems more meaningful to pursue the high efficiency of the perovskite in photocatalytic applications. Therefore, researchers should struggle to get better performances with stabilizing perovskite materials simultaneously.
(4) At present, PMs contain heavy metals (especially the common toxic Pb), which are severely harmful to the ecosystem and environment. From this perspective, one should aim to explore eco-friendly substitutable elements in the future. However, the reports about lead-free PMs showed poor photocatalytic performance, resulting from their uncontrollable crystallization and fast oxidation without a tunable bandgap.105 Therefore, to effectively improve the performance and stability of all lead-free PMs, it is necessary to deeply understand the dynamics of photo-induced carriers in PMs.
(5) Another important issue is that there is still a lack of accurate and unified evaluation methods, which severely impedes the comparison between different systems and has become a great obstacle to the development of PM-based photocatalysts. Although many scholars have realized this point, there is very little work in this field. To accurately evaluate the photocatalytic performances of different PMs, some main parameters, such as light source, photocatalyst quality, reaction medium, temperature, and stability, must be uniformly formulized. In this viewpoint, we hope to catch people's attention, stimulate heated discussions in the field of photocatalysis, and offer valuable suggestions to achieve developments in a widely accepted and adequate test and comparison method.
(6) Benefitting from their unique structural advantages, PMs are likely to be one of the most promising catalysts. And we also make a comparison between non-PM and PM material in photocatalysis applications. As shown in Table 5, we find that PMs display comparable photocatalytic performances with non-PMs. And PMs even display better photocatalytic performances than non-PMs in some photocatalytic applications. However, in terms of future industrial applications, low-cost, easy-fabrication, large-scale production of PM photocatalysts with high visible-light-driven and uniform quality is important. Besides, some specific problems also need to be solved for the application of perovskites in different photocatalytic fields. As for water splitting and pollutant degradation, though great progress has been achieved in designing PM-based composites using various materials, the major challenge is to integrate suitable materials to build high-efficiency, stable-operation, and easy-to-recycle heterojunction devices. In this way, they will be more competitive in the market than P25 that has been put into practical use.234,235 As for CO2 reduction, in addition to nano-particle photocatalytic systems, attention should also be paid to building flexible PM photoelectrodes or photovoltaic systems. While ensuring the conversion rate and selectivity of CO2 reduction, the system can also be made into a shape that is conducive to capturing CO2 in the atmosphere and separating some reduction products by using their flexible characteristics. As for photocatalytic organic synthesis, regulating the combination of PMs and other metal complexes or organic molecules to precisely synthesize bonds like C–C, C–X (X heteroatoms), and asymmetric organics is the key factor for the extensive application of PMs in this field.

5. Conclusion and outlook
We have reviewed the development of perovskite and perovskite-based materials in the application of H2 evolution, CO2 reduction, pollutant degradation and organic synthesis. Based on the stability and non-toxicity of inorganic perovskites, the research classification of these new perovskite photocatalysts is as follows: hybrid organic–inorganic perovskites, inorganic perovskites, and lead-free PMs, respectively. Besides, perovskite-based heterostructures are also constructed to promote photocatalytic efficiency, which is comparable to those traditional photocatalysts. However, challenges in their subsequent applications still exist. After addressing these challenges, PMs are expected to have a bright future in the photocatalytic field.
