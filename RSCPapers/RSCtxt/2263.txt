    , Accepted 10th February 2017First published on 13th February 2017AbstractWe designed and synthesized a series of n-type conjugated polymers by introducing phenylnaphthalenediimide (PNDI) as a novel n-type building block, and investigated the effect of side-chain engineering of the polymer acceptors on the performance of all-polymer solar cells (all-PSCs). The optical, electrochemical, and structural properties of the polymers with three different side chains of 2-ethylhexyl (PPNDI-EH), 2-butyloctyl (PPNDI-BO), and 2-hexyldecyl (PPNDI-HD) groups were examined. Interestingly, the PNDI-based polymer having the longest side chain showed a higher degree of edge-on oriented intermolecular assembly in thin films, thereby resulting in the highest field-effect electron mobility among the three polymers. Also, we examined the performance of PNDI-based polymers as polymer acceptors in all-PSCs. Unlike the trend in the field-effect transistor, the PPNDI-BO-based all-PSCs exhibited the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 4.25% among the three polymer blends. This was attributed to the well-balanced hole/electron transport and higher exciton dissociation probability in the PPNDI-BO-based all-PSCs, benefitted from the well-intermixed blend morphology between the polymer donor and PPNDI-BO.
Introduction
Development of n-type semiconducting polymers is of great importance because of their potential uses as electron transporting components in organic electronics, such as polymer solar cells (PSCs), organic field-effect transistors (OFETs), and complementary integrated circuits in combination with p-type conjugated polymers.1–7 In particular, n-type polymers play a crucial role as electron acceptors in all-polymer solar cells (all-PSCs) which have superior mechanical robustness and light-harvesting capability over a wide range of solar spectrum than the conventional fullerene-based organic solar cells.4,6,8–13 Despite the potential and importance of n-type polymers, most of the research literature for decades have focused on new electron-donating moieties and p-type polymers,14–16 and relatively limited number of efficient electron-deficient building blocks have been reported to date for the n-type polymers.13,17–22 It is therefore essential to design a new series of n-type polymeric semiconductors and evaluate their optoelectronic properties and the energy conversion performances in PSCs.
Imide-based building blocks, such as naphthalenediimide (NDI) and perylenediimide, are the most promising units for n-type polymers due to their high electron affinities and prominent electron-transporting capabilities.23,24 The use of NDI-based polymers has resulted in great improvements in the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of all-PSCs to 6–8%.6,8,10,25–28 Molecular engineering has been applied to develop various derivatives of the NDI-based polymers by introducing different electron-rich units and/or engineering the side chains of the NDI units.22,27,29–34 These approaches have successfully tuned the optical and electrical properties of NDI-based polymers, making them suitable for use in all-PSCs and OFETs. Recently, Takimiya et al. reported a new n-type polymer with a building block of naphthodithiophenediimide (NDTI), which was based on the core-extension of the NDI unit, for producing a strong intermolecular assembly.18 Despite the seemingly constructive attempts, however, the enhancement of the electrical properties of the NDI-based polymers has been relatively limited, and only a few NDI-based polymers have exhibited high electron mobilities and high PCE values.6,8,10,11,25,27,28,32 To expand the library of n-type building blocks, it is required to investigate diverse methods for modifying the structure of the NDI component.
Structural modification using side chain engineering is an effective and powerful method to enhance the optical and electrical properties of the polymers and balance their crystallinity and solubility.22,29,35–42 Introduction of aromatic rings on the side chain has been utilized for p-type polymers to broaden the absorption spectrum and to improve the charge carrier mobility, thereby improving the performances of the organic electronics.39,41,43–48 Various p-type polymers based on alkylthienylbenzodithiophene (BDTT) and alkylphenylbenzodithiophene (BDTP) are among the examples.44,47,49–51 However, the incorporation of aromatic rings such as thienyl or phenyl groups on the electron-deficient moiety in n-type polymers is a rare occurrence. To the best of our knowledge, no one has ever attempted to incorporate phenyl groups on the N-position of the NDI building block in electron-transporting polymers. In addition, a careful and systematic study on their structure–property relationships is required to expand our understanding for developing new n-type building blocks.
Herein, we report the development of a novel n-type building block, phenylnaphthalenediimide (PNDI), by introducing alkoxyphenyl groups on the N-position of the NDI units (Scheme 1a), and synthesized a series of polymers using PNDI with different side chains, i.e., 2-ethylhexyl, 2-butyloctyl and 2-hexyldecyl groups, hereafter referred to as PPNDI-EH, PPNDI-BO and PPNDI-HD, respectively (Scheme 1b). We have thoroughly investigated PNDI-based n-type polymers to establish their structure–property relationships. The optical and electrochemical properties of PPNDIs were examined by absorption spectroscopy and molecular simulation using density functional theory (DFT). Interestingly, the grazing-incidence X-ray scattering (GIXS) measurements of PNDI-based polymer films showed that the polymer with longer side chains had stronger high-order reflections of lamella peaks and edge-on oriented π–π stacking peaks. This trend was quite different from the other NDI-based polymers with no aromatic side chains.22,29 Thus, PPNDI-HD had the highest electron mobility in OFETs among the three polymers. All-PSCs based on PPNDIs were fabricated by blending the polymers with the electron donor, poly[[4,8-bis[5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophene-2-yl]benzo[1,2-b:4,5b′]-dithiophene-2,6-diyl][3-fluoro-2-[(2-ethylhexyl)carbonyl]thieno[3,4-b]thiophenediyl]] (PTB7-Th). The highest PCE of 4.25% was observed for PTB7-Th:PPNDI-BO-based solar cell. The PPNDI-BO-based all-PSCs had well-balanced hole/electron transport and higher exciton dissociation probability, which was attributed to the optimized blend morphology between the polymer donor and PPNDI-BO.

Experimental section
General methods
All reactions were carried out under an inert argon atmosphere. The 1H-NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) spectra were obtained from a Bruker 300 MHz NMR and an Agilent 400 MHz 54 mm NMR DD2 instrument (Agilent Tech.) using CDCl3 as a solvent. The 13C-NMR spectra were obtained from an Agilent 100 MHz instrument using CDCl3 as a solvent. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements were performed using a TA instrument DSC Q200 at heating and cooling rate of 10 °C min−1 under an inert atmosphere. The number average molecular weight (Mn) and polydispersity index (PDI) of the polymers were measured relative to polystyrene (PS) standards by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) eluting with o-dichlorobenzene (DCB), which was equipped with a Waters 1515 Isocratic HPLC pump, a temperature control module, and a Waters 2414 refractive index detector at 80 °C with a flow rate of 1 mL min−1. The UV-vis absorption spectra were measured from a UV-1800 spectrophotometer (Shimadzu Scientific Instruments) with dilute solutions (0.03 mg mL−1) in chloroform and solid state films of the polymers at room temperature. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were conducted with a CHI 600C electrochemical analyzer using a conventional three-electrode system (Pt disk working electrode, Pt counter electrode, and Ag wire quasi-reference electrode). The CV measurements were carried out in anhydrous acetonitrile containing 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (Bu4NPF6) and calibrated against a ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) redox couple (potential scan rate: 50 mV s−1), assuming that the absolute energy level of Fc/Fc+ was −4.80 eV.52 GIXS was performed at the beamline 9A in the Pohang Accelerator Laboratory (South Korea) and the samples were prepared with the optimized conditions of device fabrication onto a ZnO/Si substrate. The wavelength of X-ray was 1.1180 Å and the incidence angle (∼0.12°) was chosen for complete penetration of X-ray into the film. Resonant soft X-ray scattering (RSoXS) measurements were performed at BL 11.0.1.2 in the Advanced Light Source (USA). RSoXS samples were prepared on a polystyrene sulfonate (PSS)/Si substrate by spin-coating the active layer under the same conditions for the optimized solar cells. The active layers were floated on water and then transferred to a 1.0 mm × 1.0 mm, 100 nm thick Si3N4 membrane supported by a 5 mm × 5 mm, 200 μm thick Si frame (Norcada Inc.).

Dry toluene (4 mL) and anhydrous DMF (0.3 mL) were added and the mixture was degassed with argon for 20 min. Then, the vial was placed in the microwave reactor and vigorously stirred at 170 °C for 2 h. After cooling down to room temperature, the resulting solution was precipitated into methanol (300 mL). The precipitated polymers were purified by Soxhlet extraction with methanol, acetone, hexane, and chloroform successively.

Device fabrication and characterization
Inverted-type all-PSCs consisting of ITO/ZnO/active layer/MoO3/Ag were fabricated. ITO-coated glass substrates were subjected to ultra-sonication and cleaned with various solvents, i.e., acetone, deionized water, and finally isopropyl alcohol. After the cleaning process, the substrates were kept in an 80 °C oven for 30 min. The ITO substrates were treated with UV-ozone before spin-casting a ZnO layer. The ZnO sol–gel solution was produced by dissolving zinc acetate dihydrate (Zn(O2CCH3)2·(H2O)2, 99.9%, 1 g) and ethanolamine (HOCH2CH2NH2, 99.5%, 0.28 g) in anhydrous 2-methoxy ethanol (CH3OCH2CH2OH, >99.8%, 10 mL) under vigorous stirring for more than 24 h to allow the hydrolysis reaction and aging to occur. The ZnO solution was spin-coated on top of the ITO substrates at 4000 rpm to produce a 40 nm-thick ZnO layer, followed by thermal annealing at 200 °C for 20 min in air. After the films were baked at 200 °C for 10 min under ambient conditions, the devices were moved to a N2-filled glove box. The blend solutions of PTB7-Th and polymer acceptors, PPNDI-EH, PPNDI-BO, and PPNDI-HD, in chloroform with 5 vol% of diphenylether (DPE) as the additive were stirred for 1 h on a 45 °C hot-plate and spin-cast onto an ITO/ZnO substrate at 3000 rpm for 40 s. Finally, 10 nm of MoO3 and 120 nm of Ag were deposited under high vacuum using thermal evaporation. The active area of the fabricated device was 0.09 cm2, as measured by optical microscopy. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the devices were measured using a Keithley 2400 SMU under simulated AM 1.5 G solar irradiation, which satisfies the Class AAB, ASTM Standards (100 mW cm−2, Peccell: PEC-L01) under ambient conditions. The intensity of the solar simulator was calibrated with a standard silicon reference cell with a KG-5 visible color filter. External quantum efficiency (EQE) results were measured using a spectral measurement system (K3100 IQX, McScience Inc.). This system applied monochromatic light from a xenon arc lamp at 300 W filtered by an optical chopper (MC 2000 Thorlabs) and a monochromator (Newport). The calculated short-circuit current density (JSC) values were acquired by integrating the product of the EQE with the AM 1.5G solar spectrum, and showed good agreement with the measured JSC, within 3% error.
OTFT fabrication and characterization
OTFTs based on PPNDI-R were fabricated in a bottom-gate top-contact structure on pieces of a Si wafer covered with 200 nm-thick oxide (Ci = 17.3 nF cm−2). The clean surface of wafers was modified with octyltrichlorosilane (OTS; Sigma-Aldrich) by drenching in a dilute toluene solution of OTS. PPNDI-R solutions (2 mg mL−1) in anhydrous chloroform were spun onto the OTS-treated substrates at 2000 rpm for 1 min. The films were annealed at 150 °C for 30 min. A 50 nm-thick Au source and drain electrodes were thermally evaporated through a shadow mask (W = 1.5 mm; L = 75, 100, or 150 μm). The devices were characterized under N2 conditions at room temperature by using an HP4156A semiconductor parameter analyzer. The mobility and threshold voltage values were calculated according to the saturation-region equation: IDS = (μe × Ci × W)(VGS − Vth)2/2L.
Space-charge-limited current (SCLC) measurement
Hole mobilities and electron mobilities of all-polymer blends were measured by the SCLC method using device structures of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer blends/Au (hole only) and ITO/ZnO/polymer blends/LiF/Al (electron-only), respectively. The films were prepared as described in the device fabrication section above. A range of 0–8 V was applied for the current–voltage measurements, and the results were fitted to the Mott–Gurney equation:  where ε0 is the permittivity of free space (8.85 × 10−14 F cm−1), ε is the relative dielectric constant of the active layer, μ is the charge carrier mobility, V is the potential across the device (V = Vapplied − Vbi − Vr, where Vbi is the built-in potential and Vr is the voltage drop caused by the resistance), and L is the active layer thickness.
Results and discussion
To study the effect of alkoxyphenyl side chains of PNDI-based polymers on their properties, we have designed and synthesized a series of polymers through the synthesis routes shown in Scheme 1b. The PNDI moieties were synthesized from N-(4-hydroxyphenyl)acetamide with different lengths of alkoxy chains using methods described in the literature.53 Then, three different polymers (PPNDIs) were synthesized by the Stille polycondensation reaction between 4,9-dibromo-2,7-bis(4-((R)oxy)phenyl)benzo[lmn][3,8]phenanthroline-1,3,6,8(2H,7H)-tetraone (PNDI-R) and 2,5-bis(trimethylstannyl)thiophene, referred to as PPNDI-EH (R = 2-ethylhexyl), PPNDI-BO (R = 2-butyloctyl), and PPNDI-HD (R = 2-hexyldecyl). The Mn and the PDI were determined to be 47 kg mol−1 (PDI = 1.72) for PPNDI-EH, 40 kg mol−1 (PDI = 2.30) for PPNDI-BO, and 33 kg mol−1 (PDI = 1.92) for PPNDI-HD. The Mn and PDI values were measured relative to PS standards by SEC eluting with DCB at 80 °C (Table 1). To minimize the Mn effects on the opto-electrical properties of the polymers and devices, the polymerization conditions were controlled and thus, three polymers with reasonably high Mn values (around 40 kg mol−1) and similar PDI values were prepared. The resulting PPNDI-EH, PPNDI-BO, and PPNDI-HD were soluble in common organic solvents such as chloroform, chlorobenzene, and DCB.

The thermal properties of the three polymers were characterized by thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA). The onset points of weight loss of PPNDI-EH, PPNDI-BO, and PPNDI-HD appeared at 451 °C, 451 °C, and 447 °C, respectively, demonstrating the high thermal stability of the polymers (ESI, Fig. S5†). As the length of the side chains of the polymers increased, the weight loss at around 450 °C increased due to the degradation of the larger fraction of the side alkoxy chains in the polymers.54 Thermal analyses by DSC were performed at a rate of 10 °C min−1 and showed no clear melting and crystallization peaks for the PNDI-based polymers (Fig. S6†).

Fig. 1 shows the normalized UV-vis absorption spectra of PPNDIs in chloroform solution (0.03 mg mL−1) and in pristine thin films. The three different polymers exhibited similar absorption profiles in the solutions and in thin films. The extent of red-shift of the maximum absorption peaks from the solution to the solid-state was 29 nm for all three polymers. The absorption onsets of PPNDI-EH, PPNDI-BO, and PPNDI-HD in thin films were observed at 667, 662, and 660 nm, respectively, and the corresponding optical bandgaps (Eoptg) were 1.86, 1.87, and 1.88 eV, respectively. The Eoptg values of PPNDIs were close to that of the NDI-based analogue, P(NDIHD-T) (poly[[N,N′-bis(2-hexyldecyl)-naphthalene-1,4,5,8-bis(dicarboximide)-2,6-diyl]-alt-5,5′-thiophene]), suggesting that the phenyl groups of PNDI did not significantly contribute to the elongation of π-conjugation length.22,55

To better understand the bandgap and the molecular structures of the PPNDIs, theoretical calculation was performed using DFT with the B3LYP/6-31G* basis set. To simplify the calculation, the long alkyl chains on PPNDIs were replaced with methyl groups and the polymers were simplified to oligomers with three repeating units (Fig. S7†). The torsional angle θ1 between the thiophene and the NDI core was calculated as 42°. Similar to other conducting polymers containing phenyl side chains, such as BDTP-based polymers, phenyl side groups in PNDI were placed with the large torsional angles of 88° (θ2) and 67° (θ3).44 This feature could explain why the bandgap of the PPNDIs was not significantly changed by introducing the alkoxyphenyl side chains.44 In addition, the electrochemical properties of the synthesized polymers were evaluated using CV (Fig. S8†). The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of the polymers were estimated from their onset potentials of reduction (Eonred), and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels were calculated by subtracting the optical bandgap from the LUMO energy levels (Table 1). The LUMO energy levels of PPNDI-EH, PPNDI-BO, and PPNDI-HD were determined to be −4.01, −4.00, and −4.01 eV, respectively, and the corresponding HOMO energy levels were −5.87, −5.87, and −5.89 eV, respectively (Table 1). Kantchev et al. reported that the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of alkoxy-substituted NDI were lower than those of alkyl-substituted NDI.56 Also, the alkoxylphenyl side chains had weaker electron-donating ability than that of the alkoxy side chains due to the large torsion angle between the phenyl group and the polymer backbone.57 Therefore, the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of PNDI-based polymers decreased simultaneously from −5.64 to −5.89 eV and from −3.94 to −4.01 eV, respectively, compared to those of the NDI-based analogues.32
The packing structures of the three polymers in the thin films were examined by GIXS. The pristine films of PPNDI-EH, PPNDI-BO, and PPNDI-HD were prepared by spin-coating the solution in chloroform onto a Si substrate. To promote molecular ordering, the thin films were subjected to thermal annealing at 300 °C for 1 h. Fig. 2b and Table S1† show that all of the polymers exhibited strong (100) diffraction peaks along both the in-plane (qxy) and the out-of-the plane (qz) directions, indicating that they had mixed orientations of edge-on and face-on structures in the thin films.58 The interlayer domain spacings (d(100)) of PPNDI-EH, PPNDI-BO, and PPNDI-HD, obtained from the qxy values of GIXS patterns, increased gradually in the order of 27.7, 29.1, and 31.5 Å, respectively, showing that the distance between adjacent polymer lamellae increased by approximately 1.4 Å with the increase in the alkyl chain length.22,40 In addition, the distinctive (001) scattering peaks at around qxy = 0.64 Å−1 (d(001) = 9.8 Å) were observed for all of the polymer thin films. Interestingly, after thermal annealing, the thin films of PPNDI-BO and PPNDI-HD containing longer alkoxyphenyl side chains displayed prominent higher-order scattering peaks up to the third order (300) along the out-of-plane direction (Fig. 2 and S9†), which is different from the trends observed in the NDI-based copolymers.22,29 This was probably due to the twisted alkoxyphenyl groups from the NDI core, and therefore, the presence of a certain length of side chain is important to promote the intermolecular assembly between the PPNDIs.59 As shown in Fig. 2b, when the length of the side chain was longer, a more distinct (010) π–π stacking peak was observed at q = 1.39 Å−1 (d(010) = 4.53 Å). After thermal annealing, the (200) and (300) diffraction peaks of PPNDI-HD films at qz = 0.41 and 0.54 Å−1 were significantly shifted to qz = 0.45 and 0.66 Å−1, indicating the occurrence of a closer packing structure. These effects of longer side chains on the polymer packing structures were supported by the changes in the UV-vis spectra of PPNDI-EH, PPNDI-BO, and PPNDI-HD thin films after thermal annealing (Fig. S10†). The UV-vis spectrum of the PPNDI-EH thin film was unchanged after thermal annealing. In contrast, the absorption at longer wavelength of the PPNDI-BO and PPNDI-HD thin films was increased and the wavelengths at maximum absorption were red-shifted by 4 and 6 nm, respectively, upon thermal annealing, suggesting that there was an increase in the degree of intermolecular polymer interaction. Therefore, the thermally annealed thin film of PPNDI-HD showed the strongest high-order reflections of lamella peaks and intermolecular π–π interactions with the preferential edge-on orientation.

In order to elucidate the effect of side chains of PPNDIs on field-effect mobility, we fabricated and tested OFETs. All of the polymer films were annealed at 150 °C for 30 min. The electrical parameters of PPNDI-based OFETs are summarized in Table 2. The transfer and output curves of the OFETs indicated that the polymers were n-type, as shown in Fig. S11.† PPNDI-EH, PPNDI-BO, and PPNDI-HD had the average electron mobility (μe) values of 5.42 × 10−4, 4.60 × 10−4, and 1.08 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The PPNDI-HD-based OFET showed the highest mobility among the three polymers, which was most likely due to the enhanced polymer interaction with edge-on orientation. Such an orientation is believed to be beneficial for charge hopping between neighboring polymer chains along the lateral direction in the film.60

To demonstrate the competency of the synthesized n-type polymers as electron acceptors in all-PSCs, PTB7-Th:PPNDI-EH, PTB7-Th:PPNDI-BO, and PTB7-Th:PPNDI-HD-based devices with an inverted configuration of ITO/ZnO/polymer blend/MoO3/Ag were fabricated. The p-type polymer, PTB7-Th, was utilized as the electron donor for its strong light-absorbing ability and well-developed face-on packing structure, generating benign intermolecular interaction with other polymer acceptors and efficient charge transport.25,48,61 The PTB7-Th:PPNDI-EH, PTB7-Th:PPNDI-BO, and PTB7-Th:PPNDI-HD-based all-PSCs were fabricated under identical conditions without thermal treatment. The optimal ratio of donor:acceptor (w/w) in a blend was 1.5:1 and the active layer thickness was 70–80 nm for the three blend devices. A small amount (5 vol%) of DPE was added to enhance the photovoltaic performance of the all-PSCs.62

Fig. 3 shows the J–V curves and EQE spectra of the optimized devices. The open-circuit voltages (VOC) for the devices with different PPNDIs were almost identical (0.76–0.77 V), which could be explained by the nearly identical LUMO energy levels of the n-type polymer acceptors.63,64 However, the JSC values were enhanced in the order of 9.97, 10.66, and 11.15 mA cm−2 for PTB7-Th:PPNDI-HD, PTB7-Th:PPNDI-EH, and PTB7-Th:PPNDI-BO-based solar cells, respectively. As a result, the PTB7-Th:PPNDI-BO-based device exhibited the highest PCE value of 4.25%, while the PTB7-Th:PPNDI-EH and PTB7-Th:PPNDI-HD-based devices showed PCEs of 4.07% and 3.62%, respectively. The EQE spectra of the three different devices reflected the difference in their JSC values. As expected, the PTB7-Th:PPNDI-BO device had the highest EQE value over the entire range of wavelength. The integrated JSC values obtained from the EQE spectra matched with the experimental JSC values, within 3% error. The photovoltaic parameters of all-PSCs are summarized in Table 3.

To develop a more comprehensive understanding of the device performance, the electron (μe) and the hole (μh) mobilities of the all-polymer blends were measured by the SCLC method.65Table 3 shows that the PTB7-Th:PPNDI-EH and PTB7-Th:PPNDI-BO blends had more balanced μh/μe values of 2.20 and 2.62, respectively, than the PTB7-Th:PPNDI-HD blend, which had a μh/μe value of 5.60. Interestingly, the three blends had similar μe values, which tend to be different from those of the OFET devices. However, despite the well-balanced charge-carrier mobilities, the PTB7-Th:PPNDI-EH and PTB7-Th:PPNDI-BO blend films exhibited moderate PCE values. This was probably due to their lower hole and electron mobilities than those reported for the blends of PTB7-Th and NDI-based polymers.22 Thus, the photovoltaic performance of PNDI-based polymers may be improved by increasing their charge mobilities. The strong edge-on orientation of PPNDI-HD in the film could be one reason for the less balanced μh/μe and lower FF in the PTB7-Th:PPNDI-HD blends, since face-on orientation is an important factor contributing to charge carrier transport in the vertical direction and determining the PSC performance.66,67
The three all-polymer blends under the optimized device-fabrication conditions had very similar light absorption spectra, and, thus, their light absorption could not account for the different JSC values of the all-PSC devices (Fig. S12a†). Thus, we compared the electrical parameters of the all-PSC blend films under various conditions. First, light intensity dependent J–V characteristics were measured for the polymer blend films to determine the charge recombination characteristics of each blend film.68,69 The VOC and JSC curves as a function of the light intensity (P) ranging from 0.1 to 1 sun were plotted on a linear-log scale and log–log scale, respectively (Fig. 4a and S12b†). When the bimolecular recombination is dominant under the open-circuit conditions, the slope of VOCvs. ln(P) is equal to kB × T × q−1, where kB is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature, and q is the elementary charge.68 As shown in Fig. 4a, the slopes of VOCvs. ln(P) of the PTB7-Th:PPNDI-EH, PTB7-Th:PPNDI-BO, and PTB7-Th:PPNDI-HD blends were determined to be 1.16, 1.14, and 1.31kB × T × q−1, respectively. These slopes suggest that, even though the bimolecular recombination mechanism is dominant for all three cases, the PTB7-Th:PPNDI-HD blend has a slightly larger degree of monomolecular recombination, either geminate or trap-assisted recombination, among the tested blends.68 The loss of JSC in the PTB7-Th:PPNDI-HD-based device partly stemmed from the high monomolecular recombination. This trend was also consistent with the μh/μe in the blend films. In addition, the data of the light intensity-dependent JSC were fitted with a power law (Fig. S12b†). The slope values (α) of the optimized PTB7-Th:PPNDI-EH, PTB7-Th:PPNDI-BO, and PTB7-Th:PPNDI-HD-based devices were 0.86–0.87, indicating that all three blends had a similar degree of bimolecular recombination under the short-circuit condition.
 Fig. 4  (a) Dependence of VOC on light intensity (P) and (b) Jph–Veff curves of the optimized PTB7-Th:PPNDI-EH, PTB7-Th:PPNDI-BO, and PTB7-Th:PPNDI-HD blend films. 
Next, we compared the charge dissociation efficiency of the three blend films. We measured the photocurrent density (Jph) as a function of the effective voltage (Veff) (Fig. 4b). The charge dissociation efficiency was obtained from the ratio of Jph under the short-circuit conditions to the saturated Jph value at very high Veff (∼10 V). The calculated dissociation efficiencies for the PTB7-Th:PPNDI-EH, PTB7-Th:PPNDI-BO, and PTB7-Th:PPNDI-HD devices were 67%, 70%, and 62%, respectively. The enhanced dissociation efficiencies in the order of PPNDI-HD, PPNDI-EH, and PPNDI-BO-based blends were also consistent with the results from JSC trends of device performances (Table 3). Therefore, the PTB7-Th:PPNDI-BO-based device exhibited higher JSC and PCE values, due to the reduced rate of geminate recombination and the increased charge dissociation efficiency.
To glean a deeper insight into the effect of the polymer structure on the electrical and photovoltaic properties in all-PSCs, the blend morphologies under the optimized device conditions were investigated by GIXS, RSoXS, and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Fig. S13† shows the 2D-GIXS images and linecuts of the PTB7-Th:PPNDI-EH, PTB7-Th:PPNDI-BO, and PTB7-Th:PPNDI-HD blend films. All of the blend films exhibited similar (100) domain spacing of 25.3 Å and π–π stacking (010) spacing of 3.9 Å (qz = 1.60 Å−1) from the face-on stacked PTB7-Th. The packing structure of the PPNDIs was also well reflected in the blend films.
The three polymer blend films showed, however, different phase-separated morphologies based on the RSoXS and AFM measurements (Fig. 5). Data were obtained at a photon energy of 288 eV to enhance the scattering contrast between the PTB7-Th and the polymer acceptors (Fig. 5a).5,70 The blend films of PTB7-Th:PPNDI-EH and PTB7-Th:PPNDI-HD displayed distinct peaks at q = 0.0035 and 0.0029 Å−1, respectively, and the corresponding domain spacings were 182 and 214 nm, respectively. In contrast, for the PTB7-Th:PPNDI-BO blend, no discernible peak was apparent in the entire range from q = 0.01 to 0.002 Å−1, indicating that the PTB7-Th:PPNDI-BO blend film had much weaker purity in the phase-separated domains than the other polymer blends.5,22,70 This morphological trend in terms of the side chain length observed in RSoXS was also evident in the AFM images (Fig. 5b). Larger contrast in the phase-separated morphology was observed in the PTB7-Th:PPNDI-HD blend film, whereas PTB7-Th:PPNDI-BO blend had the smallest contrast. The formation of well-developed intermixed phases and large interfaces between the PTB7-Th and PPNDI-BO was likely beneficial for increasing the charge dissociation probability, leading to the higher JSC value.5,22

Conclusions
We successfully synthesized a series of novel PNDI-based n-type polymers and investigated the effect of side-chain variation of the PNDI units on the polymer properties. The structural properties of PNDI-based polymers containing alkoxyphenyl side chains were significantly different from the basic alkylchain-substituted NDI-based polymers in terms of intermolecular assembly, as the PNDI-based polymers with longer side chains exhibited prominent higher-order scattering peaks. In addition, the electrical and morphological properties of PNDI-based polymers were effectively controlled by the modification of side chain length. PPNDI-BO showed a well-organized polymer packing structure and optimized bulk-heterojunction morphology with the PTB7-Th, which afforded reduced monomolecular recombination and enhanced charge dissociation probability in the blend film. Thus, the all-PSC based on the PTB7-Th:PPNDI-BO blend exhibited the highest PCE of 4.25%, outperforming the other blend devices. Our results highlight the importance of side-chain engineering in n-type polymers and provide a guideline for the design of side chain on n-type polymers suitable for efficient all-PSCs.
