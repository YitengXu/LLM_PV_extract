1. Introduction
Renewable energy sources are increasingly preferred over fossil fuels for attaining sustainability in our consumption patterns.1 Among the renewable energy sources, solar energy is the most abundant energy source, which provides our planet with about 10000 times more energy than today's global energy consumption per day.2 Solar energy can be collected and converted into heat or electricity. Photovoltaic (PV) cells provide a direct way to convert solar energy into electricity with attractive conversion efficiencies.3–6 The third generation PV cells comprising of advanced thin films and newer PV concepts promise potentially higher energy conversion efficiencies at lower costs, among which dye sensitized solar cells7–10 (DSSC) and quantum dot sensitized solar cells11–14 (QDSSC) are particularly promising due to a variety of reasons. DSSCs were first introduced as a third generation solar cell concept in the late 1980s and early 90s.7 By the application of natural or synthetic organic dyes as sensitizers and mesoporous layers of semiconductors, such as TiO2, as charge collectors and carriers, DSSCs have attained conversion efficiencies of 13%.15 QDSSCs, similar in principle but replacing dyes with quantum dots (QDs) as light harvesting sensitizers, are considered superior because of the interesting optoelectronic properties of QDs.14 A quantum dot (QD) is a nanometre-scale semiconductor crystallite.16 It confines the electron–hole pair in all three dimensions.16–18 The size attributes a quantum confinement to the particles giving rise to tuneable band gaps, high molar extinction coefficients and large intrinsic dipole moments.17 Taking advantages of these properties, QDSSCs have attained an efficiency of more than 8%,19 despite their relatively shorter history and much lower industrial investment.
Over the years, much effort has been made to improve the overall performance of QDSSCs.20–29 Different quantum dot synthesis and sensitization methods,30–40 including chemical bath deposition (CBD), successive ionic absorption and reaction (SILAR), direct absorption (DA), linker assisted absorption, electro deposition, atom layer deposition (ALD), etc., were developed, aiming to obtain QDs with superior opto- and electro-chemical properties, while various choices of wide band gap structures (WBGS) for QDSSC, such as materials41–49 including TiO2, ZnO, SnO2, BaTiO3, Nb3O7, Nb3O7F or Zn2SnO4 and structures50–59 including mesoporous semiconductor films, nanowires, nanorods or nanosheets, were investigated to obtain enhanced charge transfer and transportation abilities. Researchers have also focused on the development of compatible electrolytes and counter electrodes to attain higher conversion efficiencies and cell stability. Classic I−/I3− electrolytes are not suitable for QDSSCs mainly because of the photo-corrosion problem.60 A variety of alternative electrolytes were investigated,61–67 among which, an aqueous polysulfide electrolyte had proved itself as the most competitive. The counter electrode, where electrons flow back into the electrolyte from the external circuit, requires materials with favorable catalytic properties and charge transfer ability to better functionalize QDSSCs.68 This drives the intensive investigation on appropriate counter electrode materials; noble metals, carbon materials, metal sulfides, metal selenides and other alternative counter electrode materials have been successfully introduced in QDSSCs. Among these, metal chalcogenides (metal sulfides and selenides) exhibit the most promising performance. This review gives a thorough overview of this class of promising counter electrode materials and their influence on the QDSSC performance.
2. Working principles of QDSSC
The QDSSC has a very similar structure to that of the DSSC, where the sensitizer is a QD, instead of a dye.11–14 Specifically, it comprises a working electrode (WE) and a counter electrode (CE) sandwiched together with an electrolyte or a hole-transporting mediator, as shown in Fig. 1. The WE consists of a transparent fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) conducting substrate, a layer of wide band gap semiconductor material film (usually a layer of mesoporous TiO2) sensitized by QD sensitizers. The counter electrode is built on an FTO conducting substrate with a layer of a catalytic material. With a similar structure, the working mechanism of the QDSSC is analogous to that of the DSSC, as shown in Fig. 2. The electrons are passed through an external circuit from the WE to the CE. The electrolyte, most commonly a solution of redox couples or a hole-conductor, works as the charge carrier mediator. The working principles of the QDSSC could also be found in many review articles on various processes central to the development of QDSSCs published in recent years.69–75

3. Electrolytes for QDSSCs
The most common electrolyte used in DSSCs is the I−/I3− electrolyte prepared by mixing I− and I2 with other additives in suitable organic solvents.7,10,76 However, experimental results showed that I−/I3− electrolytes are not suitable for QDSSCs mainly because of the photo-corrosion problem observed on QDs when using this electrolyte.60,77 Though a study was conducted to protect the QDs from bleaching by coating them with protective layers,78 the overall PCE of the cell remained quite low indicating that suitable alternative electrolytes should be found and used to improve the QDSSC performance and its long-term stability.
The photo-degradation of light absorbing semiconductors when in contact with the I−/I3− electrolyte has been observed in photo-electrochemical cells (PECs) early in the 1970s.79,80 This undesired effect was explained by the fact that the reaction (when CdS is used as the light absorbing semiconductor, for example) CdS + 2h+ → Cd2+ + S(1)competes with the desired hole injection reaction (2)leading to rapid surface degradation. Such corrosion problems are inherent in most semiconductors with the exception of some wide band gap semiconductors like TiO2.81 A S2−/Sn2− redox electrolyte was introduced to lower the anodic potential aiding in solving the stability problem though at the expense of lowering the driving potential and thus the conversion efficiency.82–84 The experimental results showed that the S2−/Sn2− redox electrolyte indeed stabilized the photo-electrode and promising power conversion efficiencies were obtained for the PEC devices.
This S2−/Sn2− redox electrolyte was adopted in the QDSSC and identified as an efficient and compatible electrolyte.60,85 The working mechanism of this redox couple in the QDSSC can be explained by the following processes.
The oxidizers in the redox couple collect holes at the photo-electrode (TiO2/QDs) and more precisely at the electrode–electrolyte interface. S2− + 2h+ → S(3) S + Sn−12− → Sn2− (n = 2–5)(4)
After the ion diffusion process in the electrolyte, the oxidized species (the Sn2− ions) are converted back to S2− by collecting electrons at the electrolyte/counter electrode interface. Sn2− + 2e− → Sn−12− + S2−(5)
The S2−/Sn2− redox couple is able to mediate the carrier for Cd chalcogenide QDSSCs efficiently. Most of the high efficiency QDSSCs reported used the polysulfide electrolyte.19,30,31,86 However, it was evidenced that the polysulfide electrolyte was not suitable for PbS QDs because of the photo-corrosion problem, again.87 By doping the PbS QDs with Hg2+87 or protecting the PbS QDs with a CdS coating layer,88 considerably high efficiency PbS sensitized solar cells using the polysulfide electrolyte were also fabricated.
Based on the S2−/Sn2− redox couple, much effort has also been made to enhance the polysulfide electrolyte's performance, such as the inclusion of additives or structural modification of the redox couple.60,67,89,90 KCl60 and GuSCN89 have been proved to be effective additives for the electrolyte to help the solar cell's Jsc. An organic cation was introduced in the redox couple to replace the common counterion Na+, which significantly improved the FF of solar cells.67 A sulfide/polysulfide based ionic liquid electrolyte was once prepared for the QDSSC as well.90
Several solid state electrolytes were used in QDSSCs to realize solid state devices, which avoids the engineering and vapour toxicity problems arising from leakages and seal degradation due to the volatility of low-boiling solvents.35,37,64,91–93 Hole transporting materials like Spiro-MeOTAD,35,37 P3HT91 and CuSCN,94 and solid-state ionic conductors involving polysulfide redox species64,93 are usually coupled with noble metal CEs to functionalize QDSSCs. However, the efficiency of the solid state devices remains lower than that of the liquid-junction cells. Future studies are expected to investigate in this interesting and exciting field.
Other electrolyte systems, such as Co2+/Co3+, Mn complexes, thiolate/disulfide, Fe3+/Fe2+ and Fe(CN)63+/Fe(CN)64+61–67 electrolytes have also been tested in QDSSCs. However, the results indicate that unless there is a major breakthrough in developing an efficient electrolyte system, researchers have to rely on the polysulfide electrolytes to move the field of QDSSCs forward.12
4. Counter electrode in QDSSCs
The counter electrode (CE) is where the electrons flow back into the electrolyte from the external circuit. It is evidenced that the CE has a vital influence on the solar cell's overall performance.95 The impact of the counter electrode on the performance of the QDSSC is mainly derived from the material's conductivity since it provides electron pathways to complete the circuit as well as the catalytic ability to regenerate the reduced species (S2−) in the electrolyte.96,97
The conductivity of the CE is affected by the sheet resistance of the FTO substrate, resistance of the counter electrode material and the corresponding contact resistance.96 It is part of solar cell's series resistance (Rs) which determines one of the solar cell's most important parameters, the fill factor (FF). A superiorly conductive CE reduces Rs, thereby improving the FF, resulting in a higher efficient QDSSC device.97
The catalytic ability of the CE can be rationalized using the term of current density (J), which can be calculated from the charge transfer resistance (Rct), using the equation21 (6)where R is the gas constant, T is the absolute temperature, n is the number of electrons transferred in the elementary electrode reaction and F is the Faraday's constant. The reactions at the CE vary depending on the choice of redox species applied as the charge mediator. When the S2−/Sn2− redox couple is used in the QDSSC, the reaction shown in (5) occurs. More detailed information on the analytic methods for CEs could be found in another quite recent review98 on the QDSSC CE, which also provides great insights into the common CE material used in this field.
Efficient CEs for QDSSCs require favorable charge transfer ability and catalytic properties. To achieve this, a variety of CEs have been studied based on the combination of different materials and structures. In the following sections, CE materials including both the conventional (noble metal and carbon) and the newly emerged metal chalcogenides (copper sulfides, other metal sulfides and metal selenides) will be introduced separately.
5. Noble metal and carbon
5.1 Pt as the counter electrode
Pt is a highly catalytic, precious, lustrous, grey-white metal. Its remarkable stability and favorable thermal/electrical properties make it attractive in various applications.99 Pt is the most common CE material for the DSSC, since it possesses appreciable electrocatalytic ability towards I3− reduction and superior conductivity.7–10 In the early stage of the QDSSC research, the DSSC benchmark Pt material was introduced to catalyze the S2−/Sn2− redox couple.60,77,100 However, these devices exhibited unfavorable power conversion efficiencies, mainly limited by the poor fill factor and short circuit current density. The incompatibility between the polysulfide electrolyte and the Pt counter electrode was pointed out, which was explained by the fact that sulfur-containing compounds adsorb preferably and strongly to the Pt surface and thus reduce its catalytic ability and conductivity.100,101
5.2 Au-based materials
In order to better functionalize the polysulfide electrolyte, Au has been studied as an alternative CE material for QDSSCs. Several studies evaluated the influence of replacing Pt with Au as the CE material on the QDSSC performance.95,100,102 Results have been unanimous that higher PCEs were obtained for Au-containing QDSSC devices indicating that Au worked as a better catalytic material. Lee et al. designed an experiment to explain this phenomenon where Pt and Au electrodes were introduced to study the adsorption behaviour of S2− on the electrodes and its effect on the surface activity, in the assist of cyclic voltammetry measurements.100 It was certified that though S2− ions adsorbed on both Pt and Au surfaces, the ions adsorbed more weakly on the Au material (Fig. 3 presents the cyclic voltammograms). The Au material in the nanoparticle (NP) form has also been applied as the CE in QDSSCs due to its characteristic properties including high surface area, transmittance and electrical conductivity. Kiyonaga et al. examined the catalytic properties of Au NPs (Fig. 4a) to reduce Sn2− ions in a photo-electrochemical solar cell using quantum dot-sensitized TiO2 photoelectrodes;103 they revealed that the size and crystal orientation control of Au nanoparticles greatly affect their catalytic properties. Zhu et al. further embedded Au NPs in a graphene network structure to build a reduced graphene (RG)–Au NP composite film as the CE for QDSSCs (Fig. 4b), aiming at the combination of the high catalytic properties of Au NPs and the conductivity of graphene.104 From a recent study, it was evidenced that an Au/Pt composite also had enhanced electrocatalytic activity compared to the sole Au or Pt material. Yoon et al. coated Au on Pt NPs by electro-deposition to form a composite material (Fig. 4c and d); QDSSCs using this material as the CE showed the maximized PCE.105

5.3 Carbon
To fabricate efficient and low-cost QDSSCs, alternative CE materials with lower prices and higher catalytic abilities other than noble metal materials should be investigated. The carbon material, a class of material featured as cost-effective, environmentally friendly, earth-abundant, corrosion-resistive and highly catalytic, is quite promising in these regards.99,106–108 Various carbon materials, such as carbon black, mesoporous carbon, carbon nanotubes (CNTs), graphene and fullerenes, have been successfully employed as CE materials in the realm of DSSC research.107,109–113 The superior conductivity and favorable catalytic ability towards the I−/I3− redox couple, plus the low cost of these carbon materials make this class of material a competitive rival. Carbon materials also show catalytic ability towards the S2−/Sn2− redox couple.114,115 This drives intensive studies on the employment of carbon materials as CEs in QDSSCs.
Fan et al. firstly tested activated carbon and hierarchical nanostructured spherical carbon with a hollow core/mesoporous shell (HCMS) as the CE material in QDSSCs.116 Solar cell devices consisting either of the two carbon based CEs outperformed devices that employ the Pt CE, indicating the better catalytic ability of the carbon material over Pt. Results also showed that the HCMS material better functionalize the polysulfide electrolyte compared to active carbon. Considering the similar roughness of the two structures, it was argued that the unique structure of the HCMS enhanced mass transportation and thus led to more efficient diffusion of the reactants and products in the electrolyte's redox reactions. A PCE of 3.9% was obtained for solar cells using the HCMS CE while the Rct between this CE and the polysulfide electrolyte was measured to be 12 Ω cm2. The authors further developed an ordered multimodal porous carbon (OMPC) CE structure.117 QDSSCs using this CE exhibited even better PCE of 4.36% and Rct of 3.5 Ω cm2, mainly due to the improvement in mass transportation resulted from the interconnected multimodal pore framework. Other carbon materials, including ordered mesocellular carbon foam,118,119 hollow core–mesoporous shell carbon,120 nitrogen-doped hollow carbon nanoparticles121 and vertically aligned single-walled carbon nanotubes,122 were also designed and prepared as efficient CE materials for QDSSCs.
Despite intensive research, the PCE of QDSSCs employing carbon based CEs remains lower than 5% for the best. The lowest Rct reported between the carbon CE and the polysulfide electrolyte is 3.5 Ω cm2, which is still one order of magnitude higher than that of Pt towards triiodides in DSSCs.117,123 These values suggest that the carbon CE might not be a perfect choice for polysulfide reduction; however, its superior conductivity makes it a proper conductive substrate to prepare hybrid materials as efficient CEs for QDSSCs. It remains to be seen whether judicious alteration of material architectures, especially at the interfacial levels, influences favourably the Rct and brings it down to values comparable to that of I−/I3− measured with Pt. The wide spread interest in carbon materials, especially graphene based, is expected to dwell on such possibilities in the near future.
6. Metal chalcogenides as CEs in QDSSCs
6.1 Copper sulfide materials
Since the discovery of CdS/Cu2S heterojunction solar cells in 1954,124 copper sulfides have drawn much attention as a highly useful component in photovoltaic cells. A suitable band gap of 1.1–1.4 eV and a high absorption coefficient of 104 cm−1 make copper sulfides a possibly ideal class of material with low cost and low toxicity.125 It is well known that copper sulfides can be obtained with different phases, from the Cu2S in the ‘sulfur rich region’ to CuS in the ‘copper rich region’. The complex structures and valence states of CuxS endow themselves with interesting physical and electrochemical properties. Studies have shown that CuxS possesses superior catalytic ability towards the reduction of Sn2−.84,95,115 This makes it promising as an efficient CE material in QDSSCs.

6.1.1 Cu2S. 
Cu2S is a p-type semiconductor with a reported bandgap of 1.1–1.4 eV and has a wide application in solar cells.126 In the 1980s, Hodes et al. found that the Cu2S-based CE possesses superior advantages when working with polysulfide electrolytes in a photo-electrochemical cell (PEC).115 The Cu2S CE was fabricated by exposing etched brass gauze in a polysulfide solution. This CE was adopted in the QDSSC, which resulted in an enhancement of device performance.43,95 Specifically, the FF and Jsc were dramatically enhanced due to the CE's improved catalytic properties. Despite the outperformance of the Cu2S material, the Cu2S CE prepared in this manner suffers from stability problems over a long period of time, which is mainly due to the fact that the residual Cu in the brass substrate constantly reacts with the electrolyte leading to ultimate disintegration of the CE film itself.101,115,130 Also, the poor mechanical stability and relatively low surface area of the Cu2S film also affect its performance as a CE. In these regards, novel Cu2S CE preparation methods were developed, aiming at the obtainment of CEs with better stability, conductivity and catalytic ability.
To avoid the aforementioned problems, FTO conducting glasses are introduced to replace brass as the substrate to deposit Cu2S films. The electroplating approach was first introduced by our group to deposit porous Cu2S films on FTO substrates.51 The CE was fabricated using a two-step method by first electrodepositing a thin layer of Cu on FTO, followed by a polysulfide treatment. The preparation process is depicted using SEM images shown in Fig. 5. The final Cu2S film composing of 20–50 nm thick nanosheets possesses a porous, flower-like structure and has a thickness between 100 and 200 nm. The favorable structure gives the film superior catalytic ability. The charge transfer resistance between the Cu2S film and the polysulfide electrolyte was calculated to be a relatively low value of 5.7 Ω cm−2, while a promising PCE of 2.6% was obtained for the CdS QDSSC using this novel CE (Fig. 6). The Cu2S CE prepared using a similar method was introduced in CdSSe and CdSeTe QDSSCs, resulting in the PCEs as high as 5.41% (ref. 131) and 6.36%,30 respectively. Other methods, including chemical bath deposition,127,132,133 spray deposition,128,134 screen-printing135 and vapor deposition,129 were also introduced to deposit Cu2S films on the FTO substrate, leading to various film morphologies and properties (Fig. 7). These efforts significantly improved the catalytic properties and stability of CEs.

The catalytic properties and electrical conductivity are two main factors determining the performance of a CE.136 Cu2S films coated on FTO substrates provide CEs with good catalytic ability but undesirable electrical conductivity due to the intrinsically poor conductivity of Cu2S. Thus, composite materials prepared by hybridizing Cu2S with conductive species are deposited on FTO substrates to form CE structures with both superior catalytic activity and conductivity. Among these CE structures, a rationally designed core–shell structure developed by Jiang et al. was particularly interesting and performed promisingly.137 In this structure, a tin-doped indium oxide nanowire (ITO) core works as a three-dimensional conductive network and a degenerate p-type Cu2S nanocrystal shell functions as a catalyst (Fig. 8a–c presents the SEM and TEM images of the composite material). Also, this core–shell structure configured the tunnel junction arrays which could facilitate charge transfer and transportation processes. Thus, the new design significantly decreased the charge transfer resistance and sheet resistance of the CE, resulting in a 35% enhancement in the QDSSC PCE compared to its Cu2S-film rival. This CE structure was further optimized by engineering the ITO/Cu2S interfaces achieved by various synthetic methods.138 The Kamat group developed another highly efficient CE structure by incorporating Cu2S nanocrystals into reduced graphene oxide (RGO) (microscopy pictures shown in Fig. 8d–f).101 Taking advantage of RGO's ability to stabilize metal nanoparticles, Cu particles were firstly spread onto the RGO mat and then converted into Cu2S by immersing in polysulfide solution. The CE was finally obtained using an ex situ method by doctor-blading the resultant Cu2S/RGO composite on a FTO substrate. The high surface area of the 2D RGO mat promotes a large number of Cu2S reactive sites, while the conductivity of the composite material enables efficient electron shuttling. These positive factors guaranteed the outperformance of this CE over the Pt electrode, indicated by a dramatic improvement of ∼75% in the QDSSC fill factor. The same CE also showed encouraging performance and stability when incorporated in a Mn-doped CdS/CdSe QDSSC; a PCE of 5.4% was obtained while a steady photocurrent was delivered over 2 h of illumination, as shown in Fig. 9.41 Following this, a one-step method was developed by Ye et al. to prepare a similar Cu2S/RGO composite, resulting in enhanced performance.139 There are also a few studies compositing Cu2S with carbon black to fabricate QDSSC CEs.140,141 Though the lab-size QDSSCs employing this CE showed an inferior PCE (mostly lower than 4%), the preferable stability and ease of fabrication made this CE a promising candidate for large-scale QDSSC production. CdS/CdSe QDSSC modules with the aperture area of over 12 cm2 have been fabricated, exhibiting a promising 2.31% PCE without cell performance degradation in 30 days (Fig. 10 presents the digital photograph and performance of the module).141

6.1.2 CuxS. 
Despite the intensive studies employing Cu2S as the CE in the QDSSC, it was reported that Cu2S is a relatively unstable phase in its stoichiometric members, mainly due to the formation of Cu vacancies even in thermodynamic equilibrium with the bulk copper metal.145 It was even debated that the structural information on Cu2S has been misled, since XRD analysis of the so-called Cu2S CE made by reacting brass with polysulfide solution revealed not Cu2S, but Cu1.75S.146 Indeed, Cu2S had already been found intrinsically unstable in previous experimental and theoretical investigations,125,147 which could be attributed to its crystal structure behaving like a solid backbone of sulfur anions surrounded by a liquid of mobile Cu+ cations.148 It was also reported that Cu2S easily degraded into Cu-deficient phases.146 The misassignment of these Cu-deficient phases as Cu2S due to their highly similar XRD patterns has also been stated in other copper sulfides application areas.126 Thus, researchers turned their attention to the entire CuxS family, from Cu2S (chalcocite) to CuS (covellite), Cu1.96S (djurleite), Cu1.8S (digenite), Cu1.75S (anilite) and Cu1.12S (yarrowite).
CuS, even though as a p-type semiconductor, exhibits mixed electronic and ionic conductivity due to the presence of Cu vacancies which give rise to free holes acting as electron acceptors.149 The good stability and conductivity of CuS drive researchers to apply it as a CE material in QDSSCs. Wang et al. developed a hierarchical CuS structure on a conductive substrate by employing a one-step electrochemical deposition method (Fig. 11a and b).142 They monitored the overall performance of QDSSCs employing their CuS CE, brass-based Cu2S CE and Pt CE under 120 min continuous illumination, respectively, among which the CuS CE showed the best cell performance and stability.142 Savariraj et al. prepared a knit coir mat structured CuS film directly on a FTO substrate applying the in situ CBD method (Fig. 11c).152 They found that by varying the deposition time, the density of Cu vacancies increased, leading to enhanced CE performance.152 Other structures of CuS including nano-flakes, nano-platelets and nano-peas143,153 were also prepared while novel materials like Mn-doped CuS,154 CuS/electrospun carbon nanofiber,144 CuS/reduced graphene oxide nanocomposite155 and CuS/porous conductive substrate156 (Fig. 11d) were introduced to further optimize the performance of CuS based CEs.

Other CuxS materials also showed promising performance when employed in QDSSCs. Chen et al. designed and developed a skeletal Cu1.75S nano-cage structure (Fig. 12a and b).157 The 3D opening hollow structure provided a large surface area and facilitated electrolyte infiltration/diffusion, leading to enhanced QDSSC performance. A cyclic voltammetry measurement was further carried out to probe the redox processes and stability of the CEs. The higher current density and the superior cyclability indicate that the novel Cu1.7S structure possesses preferable catalytic activity and stability compared to the brass-based Cu2S CE, as shown in Fig. 13. Ye et al. employed an in situ method to prepare Cu1.8S nanosheet arrays as CEs for QDSSCs (Fig. 12c and d show the SEM pictures). A facial hydrothermal method was employed to prepare the porous structure utilizing CuCl and thiourea as precursors.158

Li et al. applied an ex situ method to deposit a CuS/Cu1.8S composite material on FTO. CuS and Cu1.8S NPs were first prepared hydrothermally; followed by screen-printing on the conductive substrate.131 They manipulated the Cu/S ratio and revealed that CuS shows a slightly superior performance compared to Cu1.8S. The sintering temperature of CuxS coated FTO was also varied to optimize the CE performance. A highly reproducible efficiency of 6.28% was obtained for cells applying their CE.
Despite the intensive studies on CuxS materials, most of the reports focus on the development of electrocatalysts' novel nanostructuring or facile synthesis routes. Less attention is paid to the intrinsic electrochemical properties of CuxS. Considering the various compositions available for copper sulfides, a systemic investigation on their optical and electrochemical properties is necessary. Kim et al. developed a novel CBD method to deposit CuxS films on FTO substrates.146
By varying the concentration ratio of the precursors, CuxS with various stoichiometries were obtained, allowing a systemic study of the composition-dependent electrocatalytic activity of CuxS (Fig. 14 presents the digital photographs and XRD patterns of copper sulfides). The results indicated that when applying different kinds of CuxS materials as CEs in QDSSCs, CuS possesses superior performance compared to other CuxS. Tafel polarization and Nyquist plots obtained using symmetric dummy cells ascertained that the catalytic ability of CuxS films shows a decreasing trend as the amount of Cu in the CuxS films became progressively richer, as presented in Fig. 15. More interestingly, the stability of CuxS films was also relevant to their composition. Generally, the Cu-deficient films (CuS and Cu1.12S) were more stable than the Cu-rich counterparts (Cu1.75S and Cu1.8S), due to their greater resistance against surface oxidation.

6.2 Other metal sulfides
Other metal sulfides, including cobalt sulfide, lead sulfide, nickel sulfide and iron sulfide are also tested as CE materials in QDSSCs.163–168 Among them, CoS and PbS showed promising catalytic ability.
Yang et al. prepared a low cost CoS CE for the CdS/CdSe QDSSC employing a CBD method.164 According to their results, the electrocatalytic activities of the sulfide electrodes followed the order of CuS > CoS > NiS > Pt, however, CuS showed inferior stability. It was also argued that the greater reflectance of the CoS electrode enabled efficient reflection of the incident light on the TiO2 layer leading to more efficient sun light absorption. The same group further designed and investigated the cobalt sulfide core–shell nanosheet structure (Fig. 16a)159 and CuS/CoS hybrid material169 to obtain a more catalytic and stable CE. Yuan et al. developed an electrodeposition method to deposit CoS films on conductive substrates;170 they showed that the electrodeposited CoS/ITO CE offered remarkable electrocatalytic activity compared to CBD CoS/ITO or CoS/FTO CEs. Flexible CoS-containing CEs were also fabricated to functionalize flexible QDSSCs. Carbon fiber/CoS nanotube array hybrid structures (Fig. 16b),160 CoS nanorod array/graphite paper composite (Fig. 16c)161 and CoS nanowires/Au hybridized networks (Fig. 16d)162 were subtly designed and prepared as efficient flexible CE architectures. These CEs exhibited dramatic catalytic activity and superior mechanical strength. No obvious changes in morphology and catalytic ability were observed after bending tests, as indicated in Fig. 17.

Tachan et al. introduced a PbS CE for the QDSSC.163 The PbS CE was fabricated by immersing Pb foil in H2SO4 first, followed by polysulfide treatment. In their study, the charge transfer resistance of the PbS electrode in the aqueous polysulfide electrolyte was calculated and when compared to alternative CE materials for polysulfide electrolytes, PbS showed the minimum Rct value of all. Stability tests of the PbS counter electrode showed no degradation under illumination when in contact with the polysulfide electrolyte for over 100 h. The PbS material was further composited with carbon black171 or graphene,172 aiming at obtaining a more efficient and stable CE. The Rct of the composite CE was calculated to be less than 10 Ω cm2, which is an order of magnitude lower than the value obtained in the study on pure PbS CEs. Other composite materials, including PbS/CuS173 and PbS/ZnO nanorod core–shell materials,174 were further designed and investigated as promising PbS-containing CEs for QDSSCs.
Earth-abundant metal pyrite (FeS2, CoS2, NiS2, and their alloys) thin films were also systemically investigated as alternative electrocatalysts for the polysulfide reduction.175 CV and EIS results demonstrated the high catalytic activity of the transition metal pyrites toward polysulfide reduction and highlighted the particularly high intrinsic activity of NiS2, which could realize improved QDSSC performance, as shown in Fig. 18. Furthermore, alloying different transition metal pyrites could introduce structural disorders, which increase their areal density of active sites for catalysis, leading to enhanced performance.

Ternary and quaternary chalcogenides, normally regarded as attractive light absorbing materials in PV cells, were also introduced as CE materials in QDSSCs, due to their good stability and catalytic ability towards the aqueous polysulfide electrolyte. Non-toxic and low-cost materials like CuInS2 or Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) CE were successfully incorporated in QDSSCs and exhibited promising performance.176–181
6.3 Metal selenides
As an important class of chalcogenides, semiconducting selenides have drawn enormous attention due to their distinctive electronic properties and interesting chemical behaviors. It has been investigated in a wide variety of potential applications, such as optical recording materials, sensors, laser materials and PV fields.182–185 Quite recently, metal selenides have emerged as a new class of CE electrocatalysts for QDSSCs, despite their conventional and successful utilization as sensitizers for photo-electrodes. Choi et al. conducted a thorough study on binary metal selenide materials and assessed their feasibility as CE materials for QDSSCs.186 Eight different types of binary selenides (MnSe, CoSe2, NiSe2, Cu1.8Se, MoSe2, WSe2, PbSe, and Bi2Se3) were randomly selected as electro-catalyst candidates and employed to prepare CEs for QDSSCs. The performance of solar cells featuring these metal selenides was compared with that of QDSSCs employing conventional Pt CEs. The recorded J–V curves (Fig. 19) reveal that solar cell devices involving Cu1.8Se or PbSe CEs showed better overall performance than that with Pt, while inferior performances were obtained when applying other CEs. An in-depth study on Cu1.8Se and PbSe CEs was further conducted to investigate their physical and electrochemical properties. XRD, Raman and XPS results ascertained their chemical compositions and revealed their air stability (Fig. 20 highlighted XPS spectra of Cu1.8Se and PbSe films, respectively). Specifically, Cu1.8S has a favorable stability while PbSe was partly oxidized to PbO and SeO2 due to its instability under air. EIS results revealed that Cu1.8Se, compared to PbSe, had better catalytic ability and electrochemical stability when functioning in the polysulfide electrolyte. A maximized PCE of 5.01% was obtained for QDSSCs using the Cu1.8Se CE. However, the CEs were prepared using a SILAR method in this study, making it difficult to control the metal selenides films' crystallinity, grain size or composition. These parameters subtly dictate the resulting films' physicochemical properties. Thus, there is still much room for the improvement of metal selenides CE's performance.

Bo et al. developed a facial approach to fabricate copper selenide CEs.187 A red layer of Se was first deposited on the conductive substrate, followed by a simple Cu2+ treatment. This method was reported as easy-processing and time-saving, while it eliminated the rigorous preparing conditions. This method also allowed the preparation of other metal selenide functional CEs, such as PbSe, Ag2Se, etc. However, the resulting copper selenide film consisted of the stoichiometries of Cu3Se2 and Cu1.8Se while traces of selenium oxide were observed. This might degrade the electrochemical properties of the copper selenide film, as indicated by the lower PCE of the QDSSC obtained (lower than 4%). Liu et al. reported a low-temperature, solution-based method to deposit metal selenide films as efficient CEs for QDSSCs.188 The metal selenide films were formed by drop casting their dissolved inks onto a conductive substrate, followed by a mild thermal treatment. FeSe2, Cu1.8S, and CuSe films have been prepared using this method, all of which showed promising performance. This facial preparation method offers great potential for low-cost and large-scale production of metal selenide materials for solar cell application.
Chen et al. designed and developed Cu2−xSe nanotubes with hierarchical architecture as efficient CEs for QDSSCs.189 The 1-dimensional hollow nanostructure consisting of a flower like surface (as indicated by SEM and TEM images shown in Fig. 21) was prepared using a solution based ex situ method under room temperature, employing the Cu nanotube as an intermediate product. The unique morphology of the copper selenide nanotubes provides favorable catalytic ability and electrical conductivity while the ease of fabrication enables wider application. QDSSCs exhibited PCE as high as 6.25% when applying this nanotube-based CE. The size and composition of the copper selenides were further manipulated by Bai et al. to optimize the performance of QDSSCs. The non-stoichiometric Cu2−xSe was employed since the conductivity could be improved by partial oxidization of exactly stoichiometric Cu2Se. The superior properties of the copper selenide CEs, together with their unique porous titania nanohybrid photoelectrode structure, boosted the PCE of QDSSCs up to 7.11%.21

Considering the encouraging performance of metal selenides as CE materials for QDSSCs, the on-going studies on this class of materials seem inadequate.190–192 The development of more efficient CEs for QDSSCs could be feasible based on further investigation of metal selenide materials.
7. Conclusions and prospects
The power conversion efficiency of QDSSCs exhibited steady growth over the years due to the numerous and widespread efforts made in this area, even though it is still in the shade compared to other new generation solar cell devices, such as DSSCs, organic solar cells and the newly emerged perovskite solar cells, where the use of Pb compounds is a serious concern. A critical factor to boost the QDSSC efficiency is to build a compatible electrolyte–CE system. A S2−/Sn2− redox electrolyte has been proved as an efficient charge mediator for QDSSCs. Thus, it is of vital importance to develop a CE better functionalizing the polysulfide electrolyte. Recently, a large number of studies have been reported focusing on the investigation of efficient CE materials for QDSSCs. Noble metal like Pt or Au was not compatible with the polysulfide electrolyte due to the fact that adsorption of the sulfur-containing compound on the surface degrades its electro-catalytic ability. The carbon material, in which though no degradation was observed, showed intrinsically lower catalytic properties towards the reduction of Sn2−. Metal chalcogenides, including metal sulfides and metal selenides, exhibited superior catalytic ability and stability in polysulfide electrolytes, among which Cu and Co based materials showed extremely promising performances. Carefully prepared compositional or morphological manipulations of the metal chalcogenide materials have dramatically improved their electrocatalytic properties. These novel CE materials were successfully employed in QDSSCs resulting in devices with enhanced efficiency and stability.
In spite of the progresses made in this area, the development of high efficiency QDSSCs featuring metal chalcogenide CEs is still in the primary stage. To further develop this field, a series of experimental and theoretical issues are to be considered and addressed. The catalytic ability and conductivity of the metal chalcogenide materials could be further improved by providing higher surface areas (for more reaction sites), unique architectures (for the ease of electrolyte penetration and facile electro-catalysis) or hybridizing with other catalytic/conductive materials (synergetic functionalization). The stability issue of the metal chalcogenide materials, including mechanical stability and electrochemical stability, should be seriously considered and approaches like employing novel material preparation methods or constructing unique material micro-structures might be required to solve the problems. A fundamental understanding of the relationship between the metal chalcogenide material structures and their electrochemical characteristics is necessary to direct the optimization of the synthesis parameters and material properties. Furthermore, efforts to develop low-toxic, earth-abundant raw materials and low-cost, large-area, green manufacturing processes for metal chalcogenides should be taken as well to guarantee that the development in this area fulfils the basic commercial and environmental requirements. Thus, the investigation and application of novel metal chalcogenide QDSSC CE materials is a quite challenging yet promising research topic, which provides an opportunity for the further improvement of the QDSSC performance and for its potential commercialization.
