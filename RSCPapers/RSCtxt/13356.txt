    , Accepted 14th January 2019First published on 15th January 2019AbstractThe oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a half reaction of electrochemical water splitting that suffers from a kinetically sluggish four-electron process, and it is regarded as the efficiency-limiting step in water splitting. Herein, heterostructures of CoSe (cobalt selenide) nanoparticles and MoSe2 (molybdenum selenide) nanosheets (CoSe/MoSe2 hybrids) were fabricated through a non-metal-induced growth method. Due to the increase in the effective specific area and the electron transfer ability caused by the formation of the heterogeneous interface, the obtained CoSe/MoSe2 hybrids show superior OER performance (η = 262 mV at 10 mA cm−2) and long-term stability (20 h for continuous testing) as compared to pure CoSe, MoSe2 and physically mixed CoSe and MoSe2. Schematic energy band diagrams derived from ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy results further confirmed the electronic modulation between CoSe and MoSe2 and revealed that the d-band center of CoSe/MoSe2 hybrids moved closer to the Fermi level, giving rise to high charge carrier density and low intermediate adsorption energy as compared to CoSe and MoSe2. This work provides some insight into the design and synthesis of heterostructured nanomaterials from the MOF precursors.
1 Introduction
Hydrogen is a promising clean energy source with high energy density, renewability and pollution-free products, and is considered as a future alternative to fossil fuels.1,2 Water splitting to generate hydrogen through renewable intermittent sources such as electric energy and solar energy is considered to be a convenient and efficient method as compared to the traditional methanol steam reform method. Electrochemical water splitting takes place by two separate half cell reactions, where water is oxidized at the anode to produce oxygen, while hydrogen is generated at the cathode.3 However, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the anode suffers from a kinetically sluggish four-electron process (4OH− → O2 + 2H2O + 4e− in an alkaline medium) and it is regarded as the efficiency-limiting step in water splitting.4 The reasonable design of catalysts to increase reaction kinetics and efficiently promote the multi-step proton and electron coupling processes with low overpotentials has attracted great attention in recent years.5 Extensive efforts have been devoted to overcoming the obstacle of the OER for water splitting. It is well known that IrO2 and RuO2 are the most effective OER electrocatalysts;6 however, their large-scale utilization is limited by their high price, low stability and scarcity.7 Cobalt-based electrocatalysts including oxides,8,9 phosphates,10,11 selenides12–14 and nitrides15,16 have gained great research interest in recent years due to their environmental-friendliness and abundant reserves on the earth. However, the OER performance of the cobalt materials alone is not convincing.17 In fact, bimetallic or multi-metallic active sites have been identified to enhance catalytic activity and selectivity in various chemical transformations.18–20 Based on this point of view, various heterostructured electrocatalysts comprising two or more metals have been fabricated in recent years to enhance the OER performance. For example, Li's group reported that heterogeneous ultrathin Ni(OH)2/Ni3S2 nanoforests need an overpotential of 280 mV at 100 mA cm−2 for the OER, which is lower than those of the Ni(OH)2 (308 mV) and the Ni3S2 (290 mV).21 Wu's group constructed the heterostructured MoS2/Fe5Ni4S8 on FeNi foam. Benefiting from the formed coupling interface, the overpotential of the sample was much smaller as compared to Fe5Ni4S8/FeNi foam.22 Yang's group successfully synthesized hetero-nanostructures of MoSe2/Bi2Se3 hexagonal nanosheets. Due to synergistic effects and the electron transfer mechanism in the coupled interfaces between MoSe2 and Bi2Se3, the MoSe2/Bi2Se3 hybrids significantly promoted the OER.23
More recently, a significant amount of research has been focused on the preparation of heterostructured composites for the OER by using metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) as self-sacrificial templates24,25 because of their chemically tunable nature.26,27 However, on the one hand, most MOF-derived nanomaterials are bulk nanoparticles that exhibit random morphologies or retain the previous MOFs morphology.28–31 Therefore, severe agglomeration and poor electron transfer are inevitable for MOF-derived bulk nanomaterials. On the other hand, due to the intrinsic characteristics of the coordination compound, the incorporation of two or more desired metal species into a MOF matrix is extremely difficult.32 Therefore, it is highly desirable to design MOF composite precursors with regulatable compositions, which are highly advantageous to form heterostructures with special morphology. Polyoxometalates (POMs) are a class of well-defined early transition metal-oxo clusters that not only have the tunable size to match the MOFs channels, but also provide additional metals to fabricate heterostructures.
Herein, we propose a non-metal-induced growth method for the synthesis of heterostructured CoSe/MoSe2 hybrids. In general, POMs were first incorporated into the channels of the zeolitic imidazolate framework-67 (ZIF-67) by the in situ self-assembly of cobalt nitrate, 2-methylimidazole and H3PMo12O40. Se powder, as an inducer, reacted with H3PMo12O40 at high temperature to form sheet-like MoSe2, which resulted in the channel collapse of ZIF-67. The resultant heterostructured CoSe/MoSe2 is composed of nanoparticles and nanosheets with abundant exposed heterogeneous interfaces; this unique structure improves the efficient exposure of active sites. Besides, the strong coupling interaction at the interface is also responsible for the low overpotential of 262 mV at 10 mA cm−2 and a small Tafel slope of 54.9 mV dec−1. As expected, this performance is superior to that of pure CoSe and MoSe2 prepared under the same conditions. Our research gives a new insight into the design of heterostructured composites from MOFs precursors for the OER.
2 Experimental
2.1 Materials
Cobalt nitrate hexahydrate [Co(NO3)2·6H2O, 99.0%], phosphomolybdic acid hydrate [H3PMo12O40·nH2O, ≥99.7%], 2-methylimidazole (98%), potassium hydroxide [KOH, 90%], Se powder (99.9%) and ruthenium dioxide [RuO2, 99.9%] were all purchased from Aladdin Industrial Corporation (Shanghai, China). Nafion solution (5 wt%) was purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd. methanol (99.5%) was purchased from Beijing Chemical Crop. The water was purified by a Millipore system. All these reagents were used without any further purification.
2.2 Synthesis

2.2.1 Preparation of the PMo12@ZIF-67 precursor and ZIF-67. 
PMo12@ZIF-67 precursors were synthesized via an in situ self-assembly strategy.33 Briefly, 0.722 g Co(NO3)2·6H2O (2.48 mmol) and 25 mg H3PMo12O40·nH2O (PMo12) were dissolved in 10 mL of deionized water at room temperature by vigorously stirring for 30 minutes. The pre-prepared 2-methylimidazole (2-MeIm) solution (19.84 mmol of 2-MeIm was dissolved in 25 mL methanol) was quickly added to the above solution, followed by stirring for 2.5 h. Finally, the obtained precipitates were collected by centrifugation and washed several times with methanol and deionized water.
The procedure for the synthesis of ZIF-67 is same as the above except for the addition of H3PMo12O40·nH2O.


2.2.2 Preparation of heterostructured CoSe/MoSe2 hybrids, bulk CoSe, bulk MoSe2 and physically mixed CoSe and MoSe2. 
The obtained PMo12@ZIF-67, ZIF-67 and commercial H3PMo12O40·nH2O were thoroughly mixed with commercial Se power in an agate mortar with a mass ratio of 1:1. The mixture was then transferred to a tube furnace under an Ar atmosphere with a ramp rate of 5 °C min−1 from room temperature to 700/800/900 °C for 2 h. The obtained bulk CoSe and bulk MoSe2 were thoroughly ground and mixed in a mortar to obtain physically mixed CoSe and MoSe2.

2.3 Characterization
Inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) was utilized to quantify the molar contents of Co and Mo. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was performed on a Bruker Vertex 70. X-ray diffraction (XRD, X'PERT PRO MPD diffractometer, Cu Kα radiation, λ = 0.15418 nm, scanned range of 2–90°) was used to identify the crystal structure of all prepared catalysts. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JSM-7800F Prime) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM-2100F) were utilized to investigate the morphology of all samples. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was conducted on a NETZSCH, STA 449F3 with a temperature ramp of 10 °C min−1. The Raman measurements were carried out on a Renishaw Raman Test system (λ = 532 nm). Nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms were recorded on the nitrogen-adsorption apparatus (AUTOSORB-IQ-XR-C) and specific surface area was calculated based on the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) equation. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data were collected using a Kratos AXIS-HS monochromatized Al Kα cathode source of 75–150 W under ultrahigh vacuum. Ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy (UPS) was conducted with a Thermo Scientific ESCALAB 250Xi and a VG Scienta R4000 analyzer (monochromatic He I light source of 20.2 eV).
2.4 Electrochemical measurements
All electrochemical characterizations were performed using a CHI 760E workstation coupled with a three-electrode system in 1.0 M KOH solution. Carbon cloth was purchased from CeTech (W1S1009 type) and treated with concentrated HNO3 for 2 h. The prepared catalyst loaded on a piece of pretreated carbon cloth was used as the working electrode, and a platinum plate (1 cm2) and Ag/AgCl were employed as the counter electrode and reference electrode, respectively. The catalyst ink for the working electrode was prepared by dispersing 3.23 mg of catalyst or RuO2 in a mixed solution of 30 μL Nafion (0.5 wt%), 500 μL ethanol and 470 μL water, followed by sonication for 30 minutes. The mass loading of 0.3 mg cm−2 was used for the electrochemical study. Before carrying out all the electrochemical characterizations, the electrolyte solution was purged with O2 for 30 minutes. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) testing was carried out at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1 ranging from 0.4–1.3 V (vs. RHE) until a stable CV curve was obtained. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) was also conducted at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1 without iR-correction. The Tafel slope was calculated based on the following Tafel equation: η = b × log(j/j0), where η is the overpotential, b is the Tafel slope, j is the current density and j0 is the exchange current density. The electrochemical double-layer capacitance (Cdl) was evaluated by CV curves in the non-faradaic range of 1.2–1.3 V (vs. RHE) at the scan rate of 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, 120, 140 mV s−1, respectively. The turnover frequency (TOF) represents one electron transferred per second and active catalytic sites for the OER were determined by the following equation:34TOF = (J × A)/(4 × F × n).J represents the current density at the given overpotential (300 mV was selected in this work), A represents the surface area for loading catalysts (0.3 cm2), F represents the Faraday constant (96485 C mol−1) and n represents the numbers of moles of metal ions for the synthesized catalysts. To evaluate the catalyst durability, chronopotentiometry testing was performed at a constant current density of 10 mA cm−2. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was conducted in a frequency range from 100 kHz to 1 Hz with a 10 mV AC signal amplitude on a PAR-STAT 2273 test system.
3 Results and discussion
3.1 Formation of CoSe/MoSe2 heterostructures

Scheme 1 illustrates the fabrication process of CoSe/MoSe2 heterostructures. Specifically, the PMo12@ZIF-67 precursors were in situ assembled from Co (NO3)2·6H2O, 2-MeIm and H3PMo12O40 (PMo12) at room temperature, which were later reacted with commercial selenium powder at 900 °C in a subsequent selenization process. The formation of the MoSe2 nanosheet structure of ZIF-67 resulted in a unique structure with both MoSe2 nanosheets and CoSe nanoparticles. However, the obtained products without polyoxometalate still maintained the inherent morphology of the ZIF-67 precursors. PMo12 was chosen for two reasons. First, compared with other rigorous methods for preparing CoMo-based precursors, PMo12 as the guest can be easily encapsulated in the ZIF-67 channel at room temperature. More importantly, the graphite-like Se–Mo–Se layers were formed by the reaction of PMo12 and Se to collapse the ZIF-67 channel, thereby forming the heterostructured hybrids.23

3.2 Characterizations of PMo12@ZIF-67 precursors
X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was first employed to verify the successful encapsulation of PMo12. As shown in Fig. 1a, the identical diffraction peaks of ZIF-67 and PMo12@ZIF-67 precursors indicate that the embedding of PMo12 did not disrupt the framework structure of ZIF-67. The N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms of ZIF-67 and PMo12@ZIF-67 precursors (Fig. 1b) exhibit a narrow hysteresis loop, which indicates the presence of a minority of meso/macropores. Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) measurements were also carried out to verify the successful encapsulation of PMo12 (Fig. 1c). The characteristic Mo–O–Mo (868 cm−1), MoO (961 cm−1) peaks of PMo12 were clearly observed in PMo12@ZIF-67,33 whereas none of these peaks of PMo12 were observed in ZIF-67. As depicted in Fig. 1d, the TGA curves for ZIF-67 and PMo12@ZIF-67 show that the mass loss before 500 °C is due to the decomposition of organic ligands,34 the quantity loss of PMo12@ZIF-67 is more than ZIF-67, which is attributed to the decomposition of PMo12. Besides, SEM measurements were conducted to characterize the morphologies of the precursors. The predominantly dodecahedral shape of ZIF-67 can be seen from SEM pictures (Fig. S1a and b†), whereas PMo12@ZIF-67 presents less regular dodecahedral particles. The same morphology shows that PMo12 does not break the structure of ZIF-67 while encapsulating ZIF-67 channels.

3.3 Characterizations of catalysts
As depicted in Fig. 2a, the XRD pattern reveals the phase transition process of different catalysts. The XRD pattern of the MoSe2 catalyst shows three pronounced peaks at 31.4°, 37.8°, 55.9° which can respectively be assigned to the (100), (103), (110) planes of hexagonal phase MoSe2 (JCPDS: 77–1715, hexagonal phase, P63/mmc, cell size of 3.289 × 3.289 × 12.927 nm). As for the CoSe sample, the peaks at 28.4°, 33.2°, 44.8°, 50.4°, 60.2°, 61.7°, 69.7°, 82.3°, 83.5° can respectively be indexed to the (100), (101), (102), (110), (103), (201), (202), (203), (211) planes of hexagonal phase CoSe (JCPDS: 70-2870, hexagonal phase, P63/mmc, cell size of 3.62 × 3.62 × 5.286 nm). The diffraction patterns of CoSe/MoSe2-900 displayed various peaks that are consistent with those of the CoSe sample and the MoSe2 sample, demonstrating that both CoSe and MoSe2 are present in the CoSe/MoSe2-900 catalyst. Furthermore, the broad peak at 25° confirmed the formation of amorphous carbon.14 Interestingly, all diffraction peaks of CoSe shifted to higher diffraction angles, confirming the possible interaction of CoSe with MoSe2 in the CoSe/MoSe2-900 catalyst.35 Although similar diffraction patterns were observed in the CoSe/MoSe2-700 and CoSe/MoSe2-800 samples, the relative intensity of CoSe peaks gradually increased from CoSe/MoSe2-700 to CoSe/MoSe2-900 (Fig. S2†). This may indicate that the crystallinity of CoSe increases as the temperature increases in CoSe/MoSe2 hybrids. Fig. 2b and c shows the (2 × 2 × 2) unit cells of MoSe2 and CoSe. Clearly, the Mo and Co atoms in the bulk phase can coordinate with six Se atoms, while the surface-coordinated unsaturated Mo and Co atoms can provide active sites for the adsorption of intermediates in the electrocatalytic process.36

As displayed in Fig. 3, field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) revealed the morphologies of different catalysts. The CoSe sample obtained by the reaction of ZIF-67 with Se maintains the morphology of ZIF-67 (Fig. S3a†), whereas the MoSe2 layer structure derived from PMo12 and Se is held together by weak van der Waals interactions (Fig. 3a and S3b†). As expected, the physically mixed CoSe and MoSe2 showed the same morphology as the pure samples but there was severe agglomeration (Fig. 3b). In the comparative sample, PMo12@ZIF-67 precursors were directly calcined in Ar atmosphere without adding Se powder and the morphology of the resulting product was still similar to that of the precursors. Only the surface became rougher (Fig. 3c). In contrast, CoSe/MoSe2-900 exhibited small nanoparticles and nanosheets with sizes of ∼200–300 nm (Fig. 3d). These results indicate that using Se powder as an initiator induces PMo12 to produce MoSe2, which is important for the formation of multiple morphologies coexisting as CoSe/MoSe2 hybrids. Similar morphologies were observed for CoSe/MoSe2-800 and CoSe/MoSe2-700 catalysts (Fig. 3e and f). The differences are that the nanosheets and nanoparticles grew bigger as the calcination temperature increased, which could be attributed to the high temperature allowing the nanosheets to grow sufficiently, causing the ZIF-67 structure to collapse.

In order to further understand the formation mechanism of heterostructured CoSe/MoSe2, a series of temperature controlled samples were investigated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The TEM images (Fig. 4a–c) also showed that all CoSe/MoSe2 composites are composed of small nanoparticles and nanosheets. It can be clearly seen that at relatively low temperatures (700 °C and 800 °C) the obtained hybrids have smaller nanoparticles and nanosheets, while the nanoparticles have higher crystallinity and the nanosheets size became larger at 900 °C(Fig. 4d–f). H2-chemisorption also revealed that Co dispersion in CoSe/MoSe2-700, CoSe/MoSe2-800 and CoSe/MoSe2-900 was 11.80%, 9.09% and 5.89%, respectively, consistent with SEM and TEM results (Fig. S4†). Moreover, the structural information of the CoSe/MoSe2 heterogeneous hybrids are shown in Fig. 4g–i, with lattice fringe spacings of 0.264 nm and 0.237 nm corresponding to the (002) plane of the hexagonal CoSe and the (103) plane of hexagonal MoSe2. Obviously, abundant heterogeneous interfaces were formed between CoSe and MoSe2 (represented by the red dotted lines). In general, the interface of the hybrids not only plays a significant role in enhancing electrocatalytic activity but also intensively contributes to the electronic modulation between CoSe and MoSe2, as investigated in the following UPS and XPS analysis.23 Furthermore, amorphous carbon derived from organic ligands can be clearly observed, which is essential for enhancing the conductivity of the catalyst; the related discussion is given in the electrochemical section. The elemental distribution of Co (blue area), Mo (pink area), C (red area) and Se (yellow area) (Fig. 4j–l) further revealed that the nanoparticles and nanosheets correspond to CoSe and MoSe2, respectively, whereas the presence of carbon enhanced the conductivity of the composites (detailed discussion in the section on Raman spectroscopy and electrochemical impedance testing). All of these results prove that the carbonization temperature is critical to the formation of the unique morphology, which is in agreement with the results of the FE-SEM observations.

Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) was applied to study the surface electronic modulation mechanism of the composites. As shown in Fig. 5a, the onset level (Eonset) and valence band maximum (EV) for the spectra of CoSe and MoSe2 can be determined, respectively. In addition, the work function (Φ) that reflects the dynamics of electrons on the surface of the samples can be calculated using the formula Φ = hν − Eonset, where hν represents the energy of incident photons (20.2 eV) and Eonset represents the onset level connected to the secondary edge. As seen in Fig. 5b, the detailed schematic energy band diagrams of CoSe and MoSe2 were obtained based on the values of Fig. 5a. One can see that CoSe has a lower work function and higher Fermi energy level as compared to MoSe2, which illustrates that CoSe possesses better electrical conductivity and could deliver electrons to MoSe2 through the close contact of the as-formed heterogeneous interface.23 Since the valence band represents the information related to the d-band center, the analysis of the d-band center has received considerable attention in the literature.37,38 Although the main features in the valence band region remained the same in CoSe/MoSe2-900, CoSe and MoSe2, the d-band center shifted upward relative to EF in the CoSe/MoSe2-900 (2.93 eV) sample as compared to that of the CoSe (4.10 eV) sample and MoSe2 (4.34 eV) sample (Fig. S5†). This increase of the d-band center can also be attributed to the electronic interaction between neighboring CoSe and MoSe2, which led to the favorable modification of the electronic structure and can lower the free energy for the adsorption of intermediates, especially for OH−, thus enhancing the catalytic activity.39–42 In addition, the ionization potentials of pure CoSe, MoSe2 and CoSe/MoSe2-900 were 8.82 eV, 9.11 eV and 7.42 eV, respectively. The ionization potential can describe their electron-donating ability, and the smallest ionization potential indicates a more electron-rich environment provided by CoSe/MoSe2-900, which is also advantageous for the water oxidation reaction.43

OH−, a strong Lewis base, can be chemically adsorbed on the Lewis acidic surfaces by donating its lone-pair electrons of oxygen. Interestingly, NH3 with a lone-pair of electrons from nitrogen is also a strong Lewis base. Thus, NH3-TPD characterization was utilized to indirectly evaluate the OH− affinity of the heterostructures.44 As shown in Fig. S6†, CoSe/MoSe2-900 heterostructures exhibited two strong desorption peaks at 548 °C and 690 °C and two weak desorption peaks at 180 °C and 368 °C. Whereas, CoSe exhibited four peaks below 500 °C. These results indicate that the interaction of MoSe2 and CoSe in the heterostructures changes the acid center of CoSe.45 Besides, the total peak area of CoSe/MoSe2-900 is larger than CoSe, which results in an increase in the amount of OH− adsorbed. As evidenced by the NH3-TPD results, the chemical coupling of MoSe2 and CoSe changed the electrophilic properties of their surface.
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis (XPS) was performed to further explore the surface chemical composition and valence states of the catalysts. Fig. 6a shows the detailed deconvoluted peaks of Co 2p. The peaks located at 778.4 eV and 796.4 eV can be attributed to Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2, respectively,35,46–48 and the binding energy at 780.6 eV represents Co3+. All of these peaks confirm the coexistence of Co2+ and Co3+. Moreover, when MoSe2 is incorporated into the CoSe, the Co 2p3/2 peak shows a positive shift of ∼0.3 eV, while the Mo 3d5/2 signals shift to the low-energy region from 228.5 eV to 228.3 eV as compared with pure MoSe2 (Fig. 6b). The changes in the binding energy values of CoSe/MoSe2 composites further confirm the transfer of electrons from CoSe to MoSe2. The obvious interaction between CoSe and MoSe2 is in good agreement with the XRD and UPS observations. In addition, the peaks located at 231.6 eV and 232.6 eV correspond to Mo 3d3/2 and Mo6+, respectively.49,50 In Fig. 6c, the peaks for the binding energies at 54.1 eV and 54.7 eV can be assigned to Se 3d5/2 and the satellite peak, respectively.51 The broad peak at 58.8 eV implies the formation of the Se–O band due to the oxidation of the material during the test.52

(c) XPS spectra of Se 3d for CoSe/MoSe2-900 hybrids, pure CoSe and pure MoSe2. (d) Raman spectra of (I) MoSe2; (II) CoSe; (III) CoSe/MoSe2-700; (IV) CoSe/MoSe2-800 and (V) CoSe/MoSe2-900. 
The degree of graphitization of the electrocatalysts was further determined by Raman spectra. For all the catalysts, the peaks located at 1350 cm−1 and 1580 cm−1 correspond to the characteristic D and G bands, respectively.14 In Fig. 6d, the spectra of MoSe2 and CoSe show that the intensity ratio ID/IG is 0 and 1.03, respectively, whereas the heterostructured CoSe/MoSe2 samples have a higher turbostratic nature and structural defects as compared to pure CoSe and MoSe2, which confirmed the generation of more structural defects due to the incorporation of MoSe2. Abundant defect sites may modulate the electronic or surface properties of the heterostructures, which may greatly affect the catalytic activity.53
The pore structure and specific surface area (SSA) of the electrocatalysts were analyzed by the nitrogen sorption technique. As shown in Fig. S7,† the N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms of all prepared catalysts exhibit the typical type-IV isotherms and mesoporous structure. The BET SSA of pure CoSe and MoSe2 were 21.66 and 112.71 m2 g−1, while the SSA of CoSe/MoSe2-900 was 117.63 m2 g−1. It can be clearly seen that the SSAs of the composites are larger as compared to the pure samples. Therefore, the increase in the SSA of CoSe/MoSe2-900 can be attributed to the incorporation of MoSe2. Besides, the BET surface areas of all CoSe/MoSe2 samples are five to six times larger than that of pure CoSe, which means that the polyoxometalate-assisted construction of the heterostructures minimized the shortcomings of the bulk agglomeration for pure MOF-derived nanomaterials and resulted in improving the efficient exposure of active sites.
In general, the heterostructure is a semiconductor composed of two different materials, resulting in the generation of a discontinuous band structure at the interface. The interaction of the two structural units increases with the shortening of the distance between them. The heterostructure interface is formed when the two structural units are completely in contact with each other; at this time, their interaction is the strongest.54 The formed interface could induce new properties to further broaden the range of applications of nanomaterials. The above physicochemical characterizations demonstrate the strong electronic interaction between CoSe and MoSe2 in the heterostructures. The fabricated heterogeneous interface accelerates the transfer of electrons from CoSe to the lower Fermi level of MoSe2. Meanwhile, the heterogeneous structure also regulates the d-bond center, which is critical for the improvement of OER performance.
3.4 Electrochemical activity of CoSe/MoSe2 heterostructures
The OER performances of the prepared catalysts were investigated in O2-saturated 1.0 M KOH on carbon cloth. For comparison, commercial RuO2 was also studied under the same conditions. As evident from Fig. 7a, the overpotential required to reach a current density of 10 mA cm−1 (η10) is quite different among the samples. Notably, the heterostructured CoSe/MoSe2 hybrids all exhibit much lower overpotentials than RuO2 (η10 of 380 mV). For example, the determined η10 value for CoSe/MoSe2-900 is 262 mV, 343 mV for CoSe/MoSe2-800, and 363 mV for CoSe/MoSe2-700 (Fig. 7b). It is worth mentioning that CoSe (η10 of 364 mV), MoSe2 (η10 of 386 mV) and the physical mixture of CoSe and MoSe2 (denoted as CoSe + MoSe2, η10 of 384 mV) exhibited much weaker OER activities than CoSe/MoSe2-900, indicating that the synergistic effect and electron transfer mechanism in the coupled interfaces between CoSe and MoSe2 led to significantly enhanced catalytic activity. Tables S1 and S2† show the results of MOF-derived and Co-based OER catalysts reported in recent literature. The catalytic activity of the as-prepared CoSe/MoSe2-900 was superior or comparable to those of other MOF-derived, CoMo-, CoNi-, and CoFe-based catalysts.

As an inherent method to evaluate the catalytic kinetics of the prepared catalysts, the Tafel plots were fitted based on the Tafel equation (η = blogj + a, where j is the current density, η is overpotential and b is the Tafel slope).36Fig. 7c illustrates that the Tafel slope of CoSe/MoSe2-900 (54.9 mV dec−1) was much lower as compared to CoSe (105.8 mV dec−1), MoSe2 (126.2 mV dec−1), CoSe + MoSe2 (157.3 mV dec−1) and RuO2 (83.7 mV dec−1), which shows the rapid OER reaction rate of CoSe/MoSe2-900. These results demonstrate that the water-oxidation reaction kinetics was activated by the coupling interfaces.22 Furthermore, CoSe/MoSe2-700 and CoSe/MoSe2-800 showed the higher Tafel slopes of 132.8 mV dec−1 and 93.7 mV dec−1 as compared to CoSe/MoSe2-900, implying that CoSe/MoSe2-900 had a faster electron transfer and larger contact surface (also see TEM observations and BET results) as compared to the other two samples during the catalytic process.36 The charge transfer resistance (Rct) of the catalysts was further revealed by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements. Fig. S8a† shows the EIS results for heterostructured CoSe/MoSe2. The CoSe/MoSe2-900 sample showed a smaller semicircle and a higher slope, whereas the CoSe/MoSe2-700 and CoSe/MoSe2-800 exhibited a larger semicircle and a smaller slope. The results demonstrate that the CoSe/MoSe2-900 has a smaller electron transfer impedance and low ion diffusion/transfer resistance.36,55 This can be attributed to more quaternary-N replacing the C atom in the hexagonal carbon ring, reducing the energy gap between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest occupied molecular orbital (LOMO) and thus increasing the conductivity of the carbon substrate (Fig. S8b†).35,56 Similarly, CoSe/MoSe2-900 gives the smallest Rct as compared to pure CoSe, MoSe2 and physically mixed CoSe and MoSe2, which could be related to the charge-transfer interaction between CoSe and MoSe2 (Fig. 7d).
In order to further understand the reasons for the remarkably enhanced OER catalytic activity, the electrochemically active specific areas (ECSA) of the prepared catalysts were evaluated based on electrochemical double-layer capacitance (Cdl) to explore the active site number. Cdl was obtained from the cyclic voltammetry (CV) results acquired at various scan rates in the non-faradaic region (Fig. S9a–e†). As shown in Fig. 7e and S9f,† the Cdl of the heterostructured CoSe/MoSe2 samples were larger as compared to pure CoSe and MoSe2, which indicated the presence of more active sites in the heterostructured CoSe/MoSe2 hybrids. The results further demonstrate that the coordination between CoSe and MoSe2 increased the ECSA or active sites, thus greatly increasing the catalytic activity. In order to investigate the effect of the Co:Mo ratio on the OER activity, we prepared CoSe/MoSe2-900-50 and CoSe/MoSe2-900-75 by a synthetic method similar to CoSe/MoSe2-900. As expected, as the Co:Mo ratio increased, the prepared catalyst exhibited significant agglomeration (Fig. S10a–d†) and therefore needed a much larger overpotential to arrive at 10 mA cm−2 as compared to CoSe/MoSe2-900 (Fig. S10e and f†).
The turnover frequency (TOF) was utilized to estimate the intrinsic OER activity of the catalysts, which was calculated based on the number of oxygen molecules produced per Co or Mo site per second. Therefore, the TOF of catalysts was calculated based on the ratio of Co and Mo in the composites. The ICP-OES results show the corresponding elemental content in the catalysts and are listed in Table S3.† Note that the TOF values are smaller than the actual values because some active sites are electrochemically inaccessible. One can see that the CoSe/MoSe2-900 shows much higher TOF values than those of CoSe and MoSe2, which proves that the polyoxometalate-assisted construction of the heterostructured CoSe/MoSe2 composite dramatically enhances its intrinsic activity as compared to the MOF-derived single-component materials (Fig. 7f).
The rotating ring disk electrode (RRDE) method was also carried out by applying a series of current density steps from 1 to 2 mA cm−2 to evaluate the faradaic efficiency (Fig. S11†). The faradaic efficiency was calculated to be 93.48%@1 mA cm−2 and was then reduced to 45.78%@2 mA cm−2. This could be because only O2 can be reduced on the ring electrode during the RRDE test, thus the measured faradaic efficiency is much lower than the actual value due to many undissolved oxygen bubbles, especially in the case of higher current density or higher overpotential.
Long-term stability and durability, which are two important parameters for the practical application of materials, were investigated in this work. As shown in Fig. 8a, the long-term stability of CoSe/MoSe2-900 was evaluated after 2000 CV cycles between 1.2 V and 1.5 V at an accelerated scan rate of 100 mV s−1. It can be clearly seen that the CV curves are nearly coincident before and after 2000 CV cycles, indicating that the catalyst possesses high stability during the catalytic process. Moreover, the durability of CoSe/MoSe2-900 was further investigated at the current density of 10 mA cm−2. Fig. 8b displays that current density only drops by about 3.8% after 72000 s of continuous testing, confirming its excellent durability. We also tested the stability of the catalyst at higher current density. The results show that CoSe/MoSe2-900 still exhibited excellent stability at a high current density (∼60 mA cm−2) after 36000 s of testing (Fig. S12†). In commercial alkaline water electrolyzers, OER catalysts need to meet strict conditions and are usually operated in 25–30 wt% KOH.57–60 As shown in Fig. S13,† CoSe/MoSe2-900 needs an overpotential of 268 mV to drive a current density of 10 mA cm−2, which is similar to that in 1.0 M KOH.
DFT calculations were necessary to better understand the enhanced OER activity. Based on TEM observations, we first constructed the CoSe (002)/MoSe2 (103) heterostructure models as shown in Fig. S14a.† The corresponding charge density results show that the electrons of CoSe were transferred to the heterogeneous interface and MoSe2 (Fig. S14b†), which is consistent with the results from XPS analysis, UPS analysis and NH3-TPD analysis.
3.5 Characterizations of the CoSe/MoSe2-900 heterostructures after the OER test
It can be clearly seen from Fig. S15† that there was no obvious variation in the morphology and structure of the catalyst after stability testing. In fact, various OER catalysts are often oxidized during the OER process due to the use of high potentials, while the MOOH or metal oxide generated in situ by the oxidation of the catalyst surface is considered to be the actual catalytically active phase. Therefore, XRD and XPS measurements were utilized to explore the possible oxidation or conversion of the catalyst after the stability test. Fig. 8c clearly shows that CoSe/MoSe2-900 has the almost same XRD patterns before and the after stability test, indicating that there is no phase change in the bulk catalyst during the OER process, and the possible oxidation process or composition losses may only occur on its surface. We compared the XPS spectra before and after the stability test to further reveal the oxidation reactions occurring on the surface during the OER process. As displayed in Fig. 8d, the relative intensities of the Co 2p1/2 and Co 2p3/2 were weakened, while the relative intensity of Co3+ increased. Similarly, the relative intensities of Se 3d5/2 and the satellite peak were obviously lower than the SeOx peak and all the peaks showed a blue shift (Fig. 8e). As for Mo 3d, all the peaks had obvious blue shifts, especially the band at lower binding energy. Moreover, the band at 231.6 eV disappeared and a new Mo6+ peak appeared at 235.8 eV (Fig. 8f).50 All of these results indicate that the CoSe and MoSe2 species on the catalyst surface were oxidized during the OER process.
3.6 The discussion about excellent OER performance of CoSe/MoSe2 heterostructures
(I) Surface-coordinated unsaturated Mo and Co atoms provide active sites for the adsorption of intermediates. The results from NH3-TPD indicate that the chemical coupling between CoSe and MoSe2 changes the electrophilicity of their surfaces, resulting in OH− being adsorbed more easily on the surface of the heterostructures as compared to pure CoSe. (II) Compared to the previously reported random and agglomeration morphologies achieved by directly using MOFs as self-sacrificial templates, the polyoxometalate-assisted composites possess a unique morphology with the coexistence of nanoparticles and nanosheets that have a large specific surface area and increase the effective exposure of the active sites. (III) Polyoxometalate-assisted derived two-component heterostructures enhance the intrinsic activity of the OER as compared to the ZIF-67-derived single component. (IV) The strong coupling interactions between CoSe and MoSe2 at the heterogeneous interface make a significant contribution to reducing the impedance of electron transfer and intermediate adsorption energy.
4 Conclusion
We have proposed a non-metal-induced growth method and utilized Se powder as the inducer to convert metal–organic frameworks into the heterostructured CoSe/MoSe2 hybrids. The unique structure and electronic interaction between CoSe and MoSe2 at the heterogeneous interface made a significant contribution to the excellent OER performance. In 1.0 M KOH, there was an exceptionally lower overpotential of 262 mV at 10 mA cm−2 and a smaller Tafel slope (54.9 mV dec−1) as compared with the pure CoSe, pure MoSe2 and CoSe + MoSe2 mixed electrocatalysts under the same conditions. The present work provides a novel synthetic strategy for transforming metal–organic frameworks into heterostructured CoSe/MoSe2 composites for potential applications in diverse energy conversion and storage systems.
