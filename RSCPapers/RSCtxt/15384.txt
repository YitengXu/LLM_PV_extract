    , Accepted 6th August 2019First published on 22nd August 2019AbstractPhotocatalytic hydrogen production from aqueous hydrogen iodide (HI) over alkali metal tantalates loaded with Pt (Pt/ATaO3, A = Li, Na, or K) was demonstrated. Of the photocatalysts examined, Pt/KTaO3 showed the highest photocatalytic activity for HI decomposition. KTaO3, having the lowest excitation energy, absorbs the largest number of photons for use in photocatalytic reactions, and its corresponding catalyst has the highest number of reaction sites owing to the excellent dispersion of the Pt cocatalyst. These results demonstrate the possibility of developing a new solar-energy-based water splitting process that can convert both light and thermal energy in sunlight to hydrogen energy.
Introduction
The development of an efficient process for the conversion of renewable energy to secondary energy, such as electric power, gasoline, fuel gases, and hydrogen, is crucial for the sustainable growth of human society. Accordingly, photocatalytic water splitting is an ideal hydrogen production process because it can produce secondary energy from sunlight and water without CO2 emission. Furthermore, the photocatalytic water splitting reaction occurs at atmospheric pressure and is thus applicable to the large-scale production of hydrogen. Various metal-doped oxides, oxysulfides, nitrides, and oxynitrides have been reported as visible light-active photocatalysts for water splitting.1–5 Thus, the next goal of solar water splitting research is the conversion of infrared light energy, which accounts for half of the energy available from sunlight. Although Si, CdTe, GaAs, InP, and CuInSe2 are useful semiconductors for solar cell materials for infrared light conversion, their stability, scarcity, and toxicity are serious problems for photocatalytic water splitting. Therefore, the development of new photocatalyst materials and/or water splitting processes is required.
The iodine–sulfur (IS) process, which is a thermochemical water splitting cycle, was first reported by the General Atomics Corp. in the 1970s.6,7 The IS process can potentially exploit the waste heat from nuclear power or steel plants to convert thermal energy to chemical energy. The IS process consists of three chemical reactions, as shown below:
HI decomposition (endothermic, 673 K) 2HI → H2 + I2(1)
Sulfuric acid decomposition (endothermic, 1173 K) (2)
Bunsen reaction (exothermic, 293–393 K) SO2 + I2 + 2H2O → 2HI + H2SO4.(3)
In HI decomposition, HI is decomposed to H2 and I2. Simultaneously, H2SO4 is decomposed to produce SO2 and O2 upon thermal dehydration. Finally, SO2, I2, and H2O react to form HI and H2SO4 in the Bunsen reaction. The SO2 and H2O generated by H2SO4 decomposition along with the I2 formed by HI decomposition are recycled to H2SO4 and HI. Thus, the overall result of the IS process is the thermal decomposition of H2O to H2 and O2 under high-temperature conditions. Recently, Machida et al. reported that sulfuric acid decomposition can be achieved at 873 K using a Cu2V2O7/SiO2 catalyst.8–10 This presents the possibility of changing the energy source of the IS process from power-plant-derived heat to concentrated sunlight. However, the low efficiency of HI decomposition is one of the problems to be solved in the IS process.
If HI decomposition could be made to proceed using a photocatalyst under UV or visible light while sulfuric acid decomposition proceeds by heat from infrared light in sunlight, the water splitting efficiency of the solar IS process would be vastly improved. Fig. 1 shows the standard redox potentials of the redox reactions related to water splitting and HI decomposition. Although the energy required for HI decomposition is less than that for water splitting, it is possible that IO3− is formed as a by-product. In previous research studies, many photoelectrochemical cells for HI decomposition have been reported such as Si,11–16 n-WSe2,17 n-WS2,18 p-GaInP2/GaAs,19 p-InP/n-MoSe2 and n-WSe2.20 On the other hand, TiO2,21,22 layered metal oxides sensitized with Ru dyes,23–25 and methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3)26 have been reported for photocatalytic HI decomposition, but the energy conversion efficiency is currently lower than that of the photoelectrochemical cells. Therefore, the photocatalytic activity of alkali metal tantalates (ATaO3, A = Li, Na, or K), which have been demonstrated as highly active water splitting photocatalysts,27–29 for HI decomposition was investigated in this study.

Results and discussion
Photocatalytic HI decomposition on Pt/ATaO3 photocatalysts

Fig. 2 shows the amounts of hydrogen and iodine formed by photocatalytic HI decomposition over various catalysts under Xe lamp irradiation in a batch-type reactor. Among the ATaO3 photocatalysts, the amount of hydrogen formed (174 μmol) over Pt/KTaO3 was the highest at ca. nine times that over Pt/NaTaO3 and ca. 40 times that over Pt/LiTaO3. Fig. 2 also shows the results for Pt/TiO2 as reported in a previous study,21 which are comparable to those for Pt/LiTaO3 in this study. Thus, Pt/KTaO3 exhibits a very high photocatalytic activity for HI decomposition compared to Pt/TiO2. The effects of the metal cocatalyst and light irradiation on HI decomposition over the KTaO3-based catalysts were also investigated. The amount of hydrogen formation over Pt/KTaO3 is 13 times that of unloaded KTaO3. This result demonstrates that the Pt cocatalyst plays an important role in HI photodecomposition. The influence of light irradiation was investigated using Pt/KTaO3 in the dark but at the same temperature as that in the light-irradiated reaction. Since no formation of hydrogen was observed in the dark reaction, it was concluded that light irradiation is essential for HI decomposition over Pt/KTaO3. When the reaction procedure was carried out without using photocatalysts, HI was decomposed by UV light contained in the irradiation light, and about 2 μmol of H2 and I2 were generated. In terms of the amounts of hydrogen and iodine formed, a stoichiometric molar ratio (H2/I2 = 1) is not observed for most of the photocatalysts. In order to elucidate the reason for low iodine generation, the time profile of photocatalytic HI decomposition over Pt/KTaO3 was obtained. As shown in Fig. 3, although hydrogen formation increases in proportion to reaction time, no oxygen formation is observed. However, the amount of I− in the reaction solution decreases rapidly because of its adsorption onto the catalyst surface and reaction with the I2 formed (I2 + I− → I3−). Approximately the same amount of I3− as hydrogen is generated upon light irradiation, and the formation of iodine crystals is observed after 4 h. Furthermore, a negligible amount of IO3− is formed. The difference of the stoichiometric ratio of H2 and I2 (or I3−) formation increases as the amount of iodine formed increases. We reasoned that the amounts formed deviate from the stoichiometric ratio because gaseous iodine and the crystallized fraction of iodine in the batch-type reactor (Fig. S1†) could not be quantified. Thus, to avoid the influence of the formation of iodine crystals, the reactor was changed from a batch-type to a gas-flow-type (Fig. S2†). Fig. 4 shows the amounts of hydrogen and iodine formed in the photodecomposition of HI under Xe lamp irradiation using Pt/ATaO3 (A = Li, Na, or K) photocatalysts in a gas-flow-type reactor. In the case of Pt/KTaO3, the ratio of hydrogen and iodine formed is almost stoichiometric. Thus, the HI decomposition reaction described in formula (1) proceeds over the Pt/KTaO3 photocatalyst without direct water splitting or IO3− formation.

It has been reported that the photocatalytic activities of ATaO3 (A = Li, Na, or K) for water splitting are in the order NaTaO3 > LiTaO3 > KTaO3.28 However, Pt/KTaO3 shows the highest activity for HI photodecomposition in this study, so this was further investigated. Fig. S3† shows the amounts of H2 formed from aqueous methanol solution over Pt/ATaO3 under Xe lamp irradiation. The photocatalytic activity showed the same tendency as the result of HI photodecomposition and increased in the order Pt/KTaO3 < Pt/NaTaO3 < Pt/LiTaO3. The order of the activity is also different from previous reports, and it indicates that the preparation conditions of ATaO3 may affect the photocatalytic activity. Fig. 5 shows the UV-vis absorption spectra of ATaO3 (A = Li, Na, or K). The absorption edges of LiTaO3, NaTaO3, and KTaO3 are 260, 310, and 345 nm, respectively. Fig. S4† shows their crystal structures, demonstrating that they are composed of corner-sharing TaO6 octahedra and alkali metals and that the Ta–O–Ta bond angle differs depending on the ionic radius of the alkali metal.30–32 In the case of ATaO3, it has been reported that the Ta–O–Ta bond angle is close to 180° and that migration of excitation energy in the crystal is more likely to occur as the band gap becomes smaller.33 Fig. S5† shows the band structure of ATaO3 determined using density functional theory. The contribution of O 2p to the conduction band decreases with increasing ionic radius of the alkali metal, and the band gap tends to decrease in the same trend. The optical band gap is determined using Tauc's equation34 (αhν)1/n = A(hν − Eg),(4)where A is a constant, hν is the photon energy, Eg is the energy gap, n = 1/2 for allowed direct transition, and n = 2 for allowed indirect transition. Since the tantalates used in this study are indirect transition semiconductors, n = 2 was used to construct the Tauc plot. The inset in Fig. 5 shows the Tauc plots obtained from the UV-vis absorption spectra of ATaO3. From the Tauc plots, the band gaps of KTaO3, NaTaO3, and LiTaO3 were estimated to be ca. 3.6, 4.0, and 4.7 eV, respectively. These values are consistent with the values reported in a previous study.28 These results indicate that one of the reasons for the differences in the photocatalytic activities of Pt/ATaO3 is the different light absorption properties of ATaO3 (A = Li, Na, or K). The Xe lamp used as the irradiation light source provided continuous light with a wide wavelength range from UV light (200 nm) to infrared light (>1100 nm). Therefore, it is considered that KTaO3, which has the lowest excitation energy, absorbs the largest number of photons for use in photocatalytic reactions. This light absorption property is also useful for photocatalytic reactions that use sunlight as a light source.

Effects of cocatalysts on photocatalytic HI decomposition activity
Since Pt-loading effectively improves the photocatalytic activity of KTaO3 for HI decomposition, the nature of the Pt cocatalyst was investigated in detail. Fig. 6 shows TEM images of Pt-loaded ATaO3 (A = Li, Na, or K) and the particle size distribution of the Pt cocatalysts. The Pt cocatalysts are observed as black particles on the surface of ATaO3, and the particles were confirmed to be Pt using energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. As shown in Table 1, the average particle size of the Pt cocatalyst is 2.6 ± 0.6 nm for Pt/KTaO3, 5.1 ± 1.4 nm for Pt/NaTaO3, and 5.4 ± 1.9 nm for Pt/LiTaO3. The difference in the Pt particle size could be attributed to the difference in the surface area of ATaO3. In this study, the amount of the Pt cocatalyst was 0.2 wt% for all photocatalysts. Therefore, the number of Pt particles on KTaO3 is higher than that of other catalysts, which means that the active Pt surface area will also be higher. The oxidation state of the Pt cocatalysts was investigated using XPS, and the results are shown in Fig. 7. All peaks are normalized by the C 1s peak at 284.6 eV. The Pt 4f5/2 and 4f7/2 peaks of the Pt cocatalysts are fitted to four Gaussian curves. According to previous reports, the XPS peaks at 71.2 eV (4f7/2) and 74.5 eV (4f5/2) are assigned to metallic platinum (Pt0).35,36 The peaks at 73.4 eV (4f7/2) and 76.4 eV (4f5/2) are attributed to divalent platinum (Pt2+), as reported previously.37–39 Therefore, the Pt particles on the ATaO3 catalysts exist as Pt0 and Pt2+. Although the proportions of Pt0 and Pt2+ vary within 10% depending on the tantalate, the oxidation state of the Pt cocatalysts is largely the same before photocatalytic reactions. The oxidation states of Pt cocatalysts after photocatalytic reactions were also investigated (Fig. S6†). Compared to Fig. 7, the peak intensities of Pt 4f decreased in all Pt/ATaO3 samples, because of the dissolution of the Pt cocatalyst. In the case of Pt/KTaO3 and Pt/NaTaO3, the ratio of Pt2+ in Pt cocatalysts slightly decreased, while the peaks attributed to Pt0 were only observed in Pt/LiTaO3. In the up-hill reaction (ΔG > 0), such as the water splitting reaction or HI decomposition, the influence of the backward reaction should be considered.40 The rate of the backward reaction might depend on the oxidation state of the Pt cocatalyst. There is a possibility that the HI photodecomposition activity of ATaO3 was affected by the difference in activity for the backward reaction (H2 + I2 → 2HI) of HI decomposition due to the difference in the oxidation state of the Pt cocatalysts.

The apparent quantum efficiencies of Pt/ATaO3 for HI photodecomposition using a high-pressure mercury lamp with a 260 nm bandpass filter as the light source are shown in Table 1. Although Pt/KTaO3 exhibits high HI photodecomposition activity, its AQY is only 1.8 times that of Pt/NaTaO3 and 2.3 times that of Pt/LiTaO3. In this case, since monochromatic UV light was used as the light source instead of a Xe lamp, it seems that the number of absorption photons of the Pt/ATaO3 catalysts is similar. The difference in activity is attributable to the difference in the number of reaction sites, which indicates the importance of the cocatalyst in this photocatalytic reaction system.

Table 2 shows the HI photodecomposition activity of KTaO3 loaded with different cocatalysts. Clearly, the photodecomposition activity is affected by the cocatalyst. Compared with other noble-metal-based cocatalysts, Pt and Pd are most effective in improving the HI decomposition activity of KTaO3. In order to further investigate the effects of the cocatalyst, photocatalytic hydrogen production from aqueous methanol was performed using KTaO3 modified with various cocatalysts. Fig. 8 shows the amount of hydrogen generated under Xe lamp irradiation for 2 h together with the results of HI photodecomposition. Pt- and Pd-loaded KTaO3 show high activities for hydrogen formation in aqueous methanol, similar to their activities for HI photodecomposition. In general, the cocatalyst improves the photocatalytic activity by promoting the separation of photogenerated electrons and holes and reducing the overpotential of the target redox reaction.41,42 The hydrogen evolution overpotential of noble metals has been widely investigated in the research of electrocatalysts for water electrolysis, and it has been reported that the catalytic activities of Pt and Pd are high.43–45 Therefore, it is believed that the reduction of the hydrogen evolution overpotential helps in improving the photocatalytic activity of KTaO3 for HI decomposition. However, Rh- and Ir-loaded KTaO3, which has also been reported to exhibit high catalytic activities, shows low activity for HI photodecomposition. This is due to the durability of the cocatalysts in aqueous HI. Fig. 9 shows the amount of Pt dissolved during HI decomposition over Pt/KTaO3. Even for the Pt cocatalyst, which shows the highest activity in this study, half of the Pt cocatalyst is dissolved in the reaction solution at 2 h after the start of the reaction, and the dissolved amount gradually increases thereafter. The dissolution of the Rh and Ir cocatalysts into the reaction solution during HI photodecomposition was also confirmed. Therefore, despite exhibiting low hydrogen evolution overpotentials, Rh and Ir are not suitable as cocatalysts for HI photodecomposition. Thus, the above results demonstrate that, in addition to the reduction of the hydrogen evolution overpotential, the durability of the cocatalyst in aqueous HI is also important for the improvement of the HI photodecomposition activity. The improvement of the cocatalyst durability in HI aqueous solution is a subject for future investigation. However, alloying treatments have already been proved to be effective.46,47 On the other hand, the stability of ATaO3 in aqueous HI was also confirmed. As shown in Fig. S4,† XRD patterns of Pt/ATaO3 after reaction were almost the same as those of ATaO3 before reaction. Furthermore, significant change in the particle size or surface morphology of Pt/ATaO3 during photocatalytic reactions was not observed from SEM images (Fig. S7†). From these results, ATaO3 seemed to be stable under the conditions of photocatalytic HI decomposition.

Finally, the recyclability of the Pt/KTaO3 catalyst for HI photodecomposition was investigated. The recycling test of Pt/KTaO3 was performed four times for 12 h, totally 48 h (Fig. 10). The HI solution was exchanged every 12 h. As shown in Fig. 10, the formation of H2 and I2 was observed during each run, and the amounts of formed H2 and I2 were slightly decreased over a 48 h period of the experiment. This decrease in the photocatalytic activity seems to be due to the dissolution of the Pt cocatalyst to aqueous HI. Although a part of the Pt cocatalyst was loaded on the KTaO3 surface even after 48 h, it is necessary to enhance the durability of the cocatalyst to maintain the photocatalytic activity of Pt/KTaO3 for aqueous HI decomposition, as mentioned above.

Conclusions
In order to construct a hybrid IS process that converts both light and heat energy from sunlight, we investigated HI photodecomposition over Pt/ATaO3 (A = Na, K, or Li). Pt/KTaO3 exhibits a higher HI photodecomposition activity than Pt/NaTaO3 and Pt/LiTaO3. This is because KTaO3 has the lowest excitation energy, thus absorbing the largest number of photons for use in reactions, and has a large number of reaction sites because of the high dispersion of the Pt cocatalyst. From the investigation of the cocatalyst effect, Pt and Pd were found to be suitable cocatalysts for KTaO3. The reduction of the hydrogen evolution overpotential and durability in aqueous HI were demonstrated to be important factors for the cocatalyst. In the future, the utilization of visible light responsive photocatalysts and the improvement of cocatalyst durability are potential areas of research.
Experimental
Preparation of photocatalysts
All reagents were used without further purification. LiTaO3, NaTaO3, and KTaO3 powders were synthesized using a solid-state reaction method described elsewhere.29 The starting materials were alkali metal carbonates (Li2CO3 (Wako Pure Chemical Corp.; 99.0%), Na2CO3 (Wako Pure Chemical Corp.; 99.8%), and K2CO3 (Wako Pure Chemical Corp.; 99.5%)) and Ta2O5 (Kojundo Chemical Lab. Co. Ltd.; 99.9%). A slight excess (5 mol%) of carbonate was added to compensate for volatilization. The starting materials were ground in an alumina mortar for 30 min and then calcined in an alumina crucible at 1273 K for 10 h under an air atmosphere. After calcination, the obtained powder was washed with deionized water to remove excess alkali components and then dried under vacuum. The Pt cocatalyst was loaded by the evaporation to dryness method from an aqueous solution of Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2 (Sigma-Aldrich Co. LLC.). The photocatalyst precursors loaded with Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2 were heated at 673 K for 1 h in air to remove the Pt complex ligands.
Catalyst characterization
Powder X-ray diffraction patterns were collected on an X-ray diffractometer (RINT2500HLR, Rigaku, Japan) using CuKα radiation (λ = 0.1541 nm) operated at 40 kV and 80 mA. BET surface areas were measured on an automatic gas adsorption apparatus (BELSORP-mini, Microtrac BEL Inc.) with nitrogen gas. The UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (UV-vis DRS) were recorded using a UV-vis spectrometer (UV-3600, Shimadzu Corp.) with an integrating sphere attachment, with BaSO4 as a background reference. The microscopic structures of the photocatalysts were observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM-2100, JEOL Ltd.) at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed using an ESCA-3400 X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (Shimadzu Corp.) employing Mg as an excitation source.
Photocatalytic HI decomposition reaction
Photocatalytic HI decomposition was performed in either a batch-type reactor or a gas-flow-type reactor (Fig. S2†). The catalyst (50 mg) was dispersed in a quartz cell (dead volume: 120 cm3) containing 10 mM HI aqueous solution (30 mL). The atmosphere of the reaction cell was replaced with Ar (100 Torr) for the batch-type reactions. For the gas-flow-type reactions, Ar was used as the carrier gas (50 mL min−1), as shown in Fig. S2.† The reaction cell was irradiated using a 500 W Xe lamp (Ushio, UX-UI500XQ) under stirring with a magnetic stirrer. The light intensity of the Xe lamp was adjusted to 2.0 W cm−2. After the photocatalytic reaction, the catalyst was gathered by centrifugation (3000 rpm, 3 min) and then separated from the reaction solution by decantation. The evolved gases were detected using a gas chromatograph (GC-8A, Shimadzu Corp.) with a thermal conductivity detector. The iodine formed inside the quartz reactor was gathered and dissolved in 0.1 M NaI aqueous solution to prepare triiodide ions (I3−). The amount of I3− was determined by titration with aqueous Na2S2O3 (0.01 M). Apparent quantum yields (AQYs) for HI photodecomposition were measured using a 200 W high-pressure Hg lamp with a bandpass filter (λ = 260 nm) as an external light source. The AQY values were estimated using the following equation: AQY (%) = (A × N)/(I × t) × 100,(5)where A, N, I, and t represent the coefficient of H2 formation (A = 2), the amount of H2 formed during the reaction, the number of incident photons, and the reaction time, respectively. The total number of incident photons was measured using a silicon photodiode (S1337-1010BQ, Hamamatsu Photonics K. K.).
