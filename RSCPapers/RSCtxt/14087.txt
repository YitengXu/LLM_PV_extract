    , Accepted 6th January 2016First published on 6th January 2016AbstractCarbon powders are building blocks for electrochemical energy storage/conversion devices. Green, cost-affordable and facile preparation of carbon with applicable electrochemical properties is therefore essential for effective utilization of fluctuating renewable energy. Herein, the preparation of carbon nanoflakes via impregnation of waste biomass i.e. boiled coffee beans in molten Na2CO3–K2CO3 (with equal mass) at 800 °C and molten CaCl2 at 850 °C is reported. The microstructure and surface chemistry of the obtained carbons are specified. The correlations between synthetic conditions and microstructure/surface chemistry of the obtained carbons are rationalized. The derived carbon nanosheets are tested and compared as active materials for supercapacitors in a configuration of symmetric full cells in 1 M MeEt3NBF4 in acetonitrile and electrocatalysts towards the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in O2-saturated 0.1 M aqueous KOH. Despite the lower surface area, the carbon nanosheets derived in molten Na2CO3–K2CO3 exhibit enhanced capacitive properties and electrocatalytic ORR activity. The present study highlights the importance of thermal media on the microstructure, surface chemistry and electrochemistry of carbon from biomass.
Introduction
Inorganic high-temperature molten salts (MSs) are highly regarded in terms of energy, environmental and resource sustainability.1 Due to enhanced reaction kinetics at elevated temperatures, MS is capable of sustaining high space-time yields for materials preparation/processing and triggering reactions at appreciable rates without the assistance of costly and sophisticated catalysts.2 MSs generally possess strong capability for dissolving and/or absorbing reactants, facilitating desired reactions and removal of inconvenient impurities.2,3 Their large electrochemical windows render MSs as versatile electrolytes for electrochemical metallurgy and electrosynthesis.4,5 As ionic liquids with less solvation than aqueous solutions, species tend to occur in less solvated states in MSs. This hence provides new reaction characteristics. The present cations and/or anions can also be used as reactants for materials preparation and modifications.6,7 Their high polarity is also beneficial for the formation of nanostructured materials with unusual physicochemical properties.6,8 As thermal media with high heat capacity, MS processes can be easily integrated into solar-thermal grids to attain high energy efficiency.9,10 Last but not least, their low cost, low toxicity and technological maturity (e.g. Al extraction industry) ensure good affordability and environmental benignity for MS processes.
Carbon powders are building blocks for electrochemical energy conversion and storage devices such as supercapacitors, batteries, fuel cells and metal–air batteries. Preparation of carbon powders in MSs have recently become a research hot spot. Fray et al. pioneered electrochemical preparation of carbon nanotubes by electrochemical intercalation of cations from molten chlorides for exfoliation of graphite electrodes.7,11–14 Up-scalable preparation of graphene was recently reported by the same group by electrolysis of graphite in molten LiCl, in which intercalation of in situ generated hydrogen facilitates the exfoliation of layered graphite and hence the formation graphene nanosheets.15 A more recent innovation combining carbon preparation and CO2 capture in MS electrolysis was reported, in which CO2 is firstly absorbed in molten carbonates and/or molten chlorides and thereafter effectively electro-reduced to carbon in the same MSs without the presence of any costly electrode materials.2,9,16–20 Carbon powders with different microstructures including nanoparticles,2 sheets,16 fibres,16,19 and hollow structured carbon18 were successfully generated in such a MS electrolysis.
Besides MS electrolysis, MS can also be used as a reaction media for carbon preparation and/or modifications. Using MS as a thermal medium for carbonization/pyrolysis of carbon-rich biomass in molten carbonates and molten chlorides was recently reported.3 MSs can also function as structure directing agents/modifiers for tailoring the microstructure and therefore physicochemical properties of carbon materials. Molten carbonates were reported to be an effective re-activation agent for altering the surface chemistry of commercial activated carbon and significantly enhanced capacitance of the treated carbon was reported and rationalized.21 Controlled preparation of exfoliated carbon sheets, pitted particles and carbon nanorods was successful via molten chloride corrosion of graphite.22 Preparation of nanodiamonds in a relatively moderate manner was fulfilled by simply heating Li2CO3-containing carbon nanostructures in molten chlorides at atmospheric pressure.23
Generally, carbon powder is quite stable in MSs, which can be regarded as an inert liquid-phase thermal media. Compared with combustion in gas-phase media, carbonization of biomass in MSs tends to cause less carbon emission. Such inert thermal media also have strong capability for dissolving electrochemically inert impurities (e.g. silica in biomass), ensuring high purity of MS-derived carbon. The agglomeration of ultrafine carbon into large-sized carbon is retarded in high-temperature MSs due to insufficient delocalized electrons in metalloid carbon. MSs containing an abundance of ions can also restrain the aggregation/coalescence ultrafine carbon. These help to retain the nanostructure of carbon in MSs. Importantly, the presence of ions in MSs is helpful in engineering surface chemistry of carbon and accelerating the process of breaking chemical bonds between precursors.24
The above successes for the MS preparation of carbon highlight the advantages of MSs, which also provokes investigation on the applicability of MS-generated carbon for electrochemical energy storage/conversion devices. In this sense, specifying correlations between parameters of MS treatment and microstructure of MS-derived carbon is of importance. Herein, the preparation of carbon nanoflakes via the impregnation of biomass, i.e. boiled coffee beans, in two kinds of typical inorganic molten salts viz. Na2CO3–K2CO3 with equal mass at 800 °C and CaCl2 at 850 °C is investigated. The microstructure and surface chemistry of the obtained carbons are carefully characterized and specified. After rationalization of the correlations between synthetic conditions and microstructure/surface chemistry of the obtained carbons, the derived carbon nanosheets were tested as active materials for supercapacitors in a symmetric full-cell configuration in 1 M MeEt3NBF4 in acetonitrile and electrocatalysts towards the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in 0.1 M aqueous KOH. Despite the lower specific surface area, the carbon nanosheets derived in molten Na2CO3–K2CO3 exhibited enhanced capacitive properties and electrocatalytic ORR activity than those derived in molten chlorides. The present study highlights the importance of thermal media on the microstructure, surface chemistry and electrochemistry of carbon from biomass.
Experimental
Commercial coffee beans (Arabica coffee beans, LIM's drop coffee roasters, blue mountain flavoring) were purchased from supermarkets. CaCl2, Na2CO3 and K2CO3 with purities higher than 99.9% purity were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Regent Co. Ltd., China. The purchased coffee beans were then boiled in deionized water for 1 hour. Then the boiled coffee beans were thoroughly rinsed in deionized water and then dried in air at 120 °C overnight. The derived powder was directly used in the following MS treatment. 500 g anhydrous CaCl2 or Na2CO3–K2CO3 (equal in mass, eutectic point at 709 °C) contained in an alumina crucible were firstly heated at 250 °C for 24 h. The alumina crucibles were then placed and sealed in a stainless steel reactor, in which argon gas (>99.999%) was continuously purged to guarantee an anaerobic environment. The MS reactor was then heated to the target temperatures (800 °C for Na2CO3–K2CO3 and 850 °C for CaCl2). After the MS melted, 20 g boiled coffee beans wrapped with a nickel foam sheet were immersed in the MS. After MS treatment for 1 h, the MS-treated samples were washed with 0.1 M HCl, hot deionized water and deionized water until a neutral pH value was reached. The samples were then dried in air at 120 °C. The as-obtained carbons were then characterized, with the experimental details being provided in the ESI.†
Results and discussion

Fig. 1a shows the XRD patterns of the samples derived upon treatment in the molten carbonates (800 °C Na2CO3–K2CO3) and molten chlorides (850 °C for CaCl2), respectively. In both patterns, only two broad and weak peaks occur, indicating poor crystallinity of the two samples. The peaks located at around 22 degrees are assigned to a (002) reflection of a graphitic-type lattice, whilst the shoulders occurring at 43 degrees are indexed to disorder stacking of micro-graphite.21 The discrepancy on peak intensity and width suggests a higher crystallinity and more ordered structure of the sample treated in molten carbonates.
 Fig. 1  Powder XRD patterns (a), Raman spectra (b), FT-IR spectra (c) and N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms (d) of the precursory boiled coffee beans and derived carbons. 

Fig. 1b shows the Raman spectra of the two samples. Two characteristic peaks ascribed to D and G bands of carbon appear in both spectra. The two spectra can be well indexed to disordered carbon. The D band located at 1360 cm−1 only becomes active in the presence of disorder. The G band reflecting the relative motion of sp2 carbon atoms is ascribed to ordered carbon. In the spectrum for the sample treated in molten chlorides, the intensity of the D band is higher than that of the G band, whilst a more intense G band than D band appears in the spectra for the molten carbonated treated sample. This suggests that the sample treated in molten carbonates has a more ordered carbon structure, in a good agreement with the XRD patterns.
Surface functional groups over the MS-treated samples were examined by FT-IR. Fig. 1c displays the FT-IR spectra of the precursor (boiled coffee beans) and MS-treated samples. A typical O–H stretching vibration peak at 3400 cm−1 corresponding to hydroxyl groups appears in the three samples. The peak at 2920 cm−1 corresponds to the –CH–, –CH2– or –CH3 stretching. The peak at 1620 cm−1 may be ascribed to the presence of coupled carbonyl groups and aromatic ring stretching. The peak located at 1420 cm−1 corresponds to the C–C stretching vibration. The peak centered at 1060 cm−1 is associated with the C–O vibration of peroxide and/or heterocyclic CO rings. After MS treatment, all the peaks belonging to organic species become much smaller, indicating occurrence of carbonization of the precursory biomass. The peak at 613 cm−1 only appears in the molten chloride treated sample, probably attributed to the C–Cl vibration due to the presence of trace residual chlorides.3 In comparison with the molten chlorides treated sample, the spectrum of the molten carbonate treated sample shows lower intensities of the surface functional groups. This suggests fewer surface functional groups in the molten carbonates treated sample. The presence of surface functional groups generally prompts formation of less ordered carbon, agreeing well with the Raman spectra.
N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms at 77 K of the two MS treated samples are shown in Fig. 1d. The two isotherms are of typical type I isotherms with clear H4-type hysteresis loops according to the IUPAC classification.21 The hysteresis loop for the MS carbonate treated sample terminates at a lower relative pressure than that of the sample treated in molten chlorides, indicating more micropores in the former. The BET surface areas are determined to be 436 and 550 m2 g−1 for the molten carbonate and chloride treated samples, respectively. A high specific surface area occurs in the sample treated in molten chloride.
Surface chemistry of the MS treated samples is further examined by XPS. As shown in Fig. 2, all the XPS survey spectra (Fig. 2a1, b1 and c1) only show the peaks of C 1s and O 1s. After MS treatment, the O 1s peaks become significantly weakened, indicating carbonization upon MS treatment.
 Fig. 2  Survey XPS spectra (a1, b1 and c1), high-resolution O 1s spectra (a2, b2 and c2) and high-resolution C 1s spectra (a3, b3 and c3) of the precursory boiled coffee beans (a1, a2 and a3) and the samples after being treated in molten chlorides (b1, b2 and b3) and molten carbonates (c1, c2 and c3). 

Table 1 summarizes all the XPS data. The survey spectra also indicate a much smaller oxygen content for the sample treated in molten carbonates, compared to that treated in molten chlorides. For high-resolution C 1s spectra (Fig. 2a3, b3 and c3), the peaks located at 284.6, 286.0 and 288.8 eV are ascribed to C–C/CC/C–H, C–O and O–CO bonds. The O–CO peak only exists in the precursor, due to the presence of bulk organic species. Smaller C–O signals appear in the carbonate-treated sample, suggesting fewer oxygen-containing surface functional groups in the sample. All the high-resolution O 1s spectra can be de-convolved into three peaks appearing at 531.6, 533.2 and 534.0 eV, which are assigned to OC, O–C and O–H bonds. Smaller OC signals exist in the carbonated treated sample, indicating its higher purity. FI-IR and XPS confirm the carbonization of biomass upon MS treatment. It is also verified that oxygen-containing groups including OC, O–C and O–H exist at the surface of MS-derived carbon and fewer oxygen-containing groups appear in the sample treated in molten carbonates.

SEM images of the samples are shown in Fig. 3. It is exhibited in Fig. 3a that the precursory boiled coffee beans consist of less porous granules with sizes ranging from 5 to 30 μm. After MS treatment, the samples become much more porous and nanoflakes becomes the predominant morphology (Fig. 3b and c). The generated nanoflakes are interconnected, with pores existing in the interstitial sites. Decomposition of biomass results in such interstitial sites, with hydrates and other organic species becoming released from the solid. The remaining carbonized species then restack in the MSs, generating the obtained nanoflakes. By comparing Fig. 3b1 and c1 (in the same magnitude of magnification), it is clearly shown that the chloride-treated sample has a smaller particle size. Therefore the chloride-treated sample shows a higher BET surface area. Fig. 3b2 shows the formation of uniform nanoflakes after molten carbonate treatment. The same nanoflakes also appear in the molten chloride treated sample (Fig. 3c2), with co-existence of more tiny nanoflakes. The formation of smaller nanoflakes also contributes to the higher specific surface area of the sample.

The molten carbonate treated sample was further examined by AFM. As shown in Fig. 4 and S1 (see ESI†), the generated nanoflakes are of thicknesses ranging from 30 to 80 nm. A graphite-like lamellar structure is clearly shown in the surface of the nanoflakes. The corresponding line-scan plots disclose the fine microstructures of the nanoflakes. As shown in the AFM images, the region near the line 1 has a larger thickness and the surface of such thicker nanoflakes consists of an ordered layered microstructure. The thickness of an individual layer is determined to be 2–3 nm. This indicates the generated amorphous carbon tends to restack into a more ordered structure in MSs. Such restacking is more manifest on the surface of the nanoflakes, with inner parts retaining the disordered structure. Line 2 represents such a disordered structure. It is found that the line 2 part exhibits a consistent thickness of 25 nm and the layered microstructure is absent in the disordered region.

The above results confirm the successful MS carbonization of biomass. The corresponding characterizations show that the chloride-treated carbon has a higher specific surface area, more surface functional groups and less ordered microstructure. Such difference is believed to be relevant to the nature of the MSs. It is well known that CaCl2 is a strong desiccant due to its intrinsic affinity to moisture. Even when anhydrous CaCl2 is employed, hydrolysis of CaCl2 is still significant and the hydrolysis products, i.e. Ca(OH)2 and HCl tend to dissolve (calcium hydroxide) or become released (HCl) in/from the melts. Therefore, the hydrolysis of molten CaCl2 is inevitable in practical applications. In addition, the generated Ca(OH)2 is readily decomposed to CaO and H2O. The former has high solubility in the melts,5,8,15,25–27 and the latter could bring about further hydrolysis. Therefore, molten CaCl2 always contains appreciable amounts of oxygen anions (O2−). In contrast, molten carbonates only show very minor hydrolysis effects, if any. Therefore, much less O2− occurs in molten carbonates. The presence of O2− increases the corrosive capability of the melts, therefore many more tiny nanoflakes coexist in the carbon derived in molten CaCl2 and a higher specific surface area of the sample appears. The O2− could also modify the surface of the derived carbon, with the formation of surface functional groups. Therefore, more oxygen-containing surface functional groups occur over the surface of the chlorides-treated sample. The oxygen-containing surface functional groups tend to retard the restacking of the amorphous carbon, resulting in the formation of less ordered carbon in the chlorides-treated sample.
Carbon possesses a predominant share in commercial supercapacitor markets. The capacitive properties of the as-obtained carbon are thus tested in a symmetric full-cell configuration in 1 M MeEt3NBF4 in acetonitrile (MeEt3NBF4/AN). Cyclic voltammetric (CV) and galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD) scans at different rates are recorded at voltages ranging from 0 to 2 V. Fig. 5a and b show the CV plots based on the two MS-derived carbon powders. For the molten carbonate-derived carbon capacitor, all CVs are of ideal rectangular shapes, even under a high scan rate of 200 mV s−1. This suggests an excellent high-rate capability of the sample. The specific capacitances derived from CVs are 155, 154, 152, 142 and 132 F g−1 for scans at 10, 20, 50, 100 and 200 mV s−1 (Fig. 5e). With increasing scan rates from 10 to 200 mV s−1, capacitance retention of 85.16% is achieved. Compared to the carbonate-derived carbon capacitor, the CVs of the chloride-derived carbon capacitor (Fig. 5b) exhibit much lower current density and more distorted CV shapes, indicating lower specific capacitance and inferior high-rate capability. As shown in Fig. 5e, the specific capacitances derived from CVs of the chloride-derived carbon are 98, 95, 86, 72 and 59 F g−1 for scans at 10, 20, 50, 100 and 200 mV s−1 respectively (Fig. 5e). Capacitance retention as low as 60.20% occurs, much lower than that of the carbonate-derived sample (85.16%).

The panels (e) and (f) show the comparison on specific capacitance according to the CV and GCD plots. The loadings of active materials in each single electrode are 2.30 and 2.48 mg for the carbonate and chloride samples, respectively. 

Fig. 5c, d and f compare the GCD results of the two samples, which agree well with the CV data. At 0.5 A g−1, the carbonate-derived carbon delivers a specific capacitance as high as 161 F g−1. Even under a rate as high as 32 A g−1, a capacitance of 125 F g−1 remains, highlighting its excellent high-rate capability. Much lower specific capacitance and inferior high-rate performance appear in the chloride-derived carbon. Under 0.4 A g−1, a capacitance as low as 93.4 F g−1 occurs in the chloride-derived sample. This value sharply decreases to 50 F g−1 with increasing charge–discharge current density to 10 A g−1.
Energy and power densities of the assembled symmetric full cell in 1 M MeEt3NBF4/AN are also demonstrated in the Ragone plots shown in Fig. 6a. The Ragone plots are derived from the GCD plots shown in Fig. 5c and d (see ESI† for details). It is clearly shown that much higher energy and power density occurs in the molten carbonate derived carbon capacitor. The maximal energy density for the capacitor is as high as 22.27 W h kg−1. Only a maximal energy density of 12.77 W h kg−1 appears for the molten chloride derived carbon capacitor, with a power density occurring at 197 W kg−1. At a similar energy density (12.67 W h kg−1), the molten carbonate derived carbon capacitor delivers a power density as high as 11696.4 W kg−1.

The panel c shows the cycling performance of the molten-carbonates full-cell capacitor recorded at galvanostatic current density of 4 A g−1 for 1700 cycles, with the galvanostatic charge–discharge plots at the first and 1700th cycles being shown in the inset. The panel (d) highlights the LED lamp which got illuminated driven by the two connected-in-serial molten-carbonates full-cell capacitors. 

Fig. 6b shows the corresponding electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) of the full cells. The loadings of active materials in each single electrode are 2.30 and 2.48 mg for the carbonate and chloride samples, respectively. Due to the different loadings for each capacitor, the resistance of the chloride-derived capacitor was normalized by a factor of 2.48/2.30. The intercept with the x axis at high frequency ranges indicates the equivalent serial resistance (ESR). The ESRs for the two capacitors in the 1st cycle are determined to be 0.65 and 1.17 ohm for the carbonate and chloride derived carbon capacitors, respectively. A lower ESR for the carbonate-derived capacitor suggests a higher electrical conductivity of the carbon. The semi-cycles in the EIS represent charge-transfer resistance at electrochemical interfaces, with larger charge-transfer resistance occurring at larger semi-cycles. It is found that the carbonate-derived capacitor exhibits a much smaller charge-transfer resistance.
The above electrochemical measurements confirm the enhanced capacitive properties of the carbonate-derived carbon to the chloride-derived sample, despite larger specific surface area of the latter. This can be rationalized according to the difference in surface chemistry. The carbon derived from molten chloride contains more oxygen-containing surface functional groups, which tend to deteriorate the electrical conductivity. In addition, surface functional groups incur formation of more disordered carbon, which possesses lower electrical conductivity. Therefore, the carbon derived from molten chloride exhibits a lower electrical conductivity than that derived from molten carbonates, as evidenced by the much higher ESR of the chloride-derived capacitor. For electrochemical double layer capacitors, the capacitance is proportional to the reciprocal of the distance between of the outer Helmholtz plane (OHP) and electrode surface. Surface functional groups tend to increase the distance of OHP. Therefore, a lower specific capacitance and a higher charge-transfer resistance are observed for the chloride-derived carbon capacitor. In this regard, molten carbonates are more promising media for carbonization of biomass for capacitive carbon, agreeing well with recent literature regarding enhanced capacitive properties of commercial carbon by molten carbonates treatment.21
The cycling performance of the molten carbonate derived carbon capacitor was tested upon GCD at 4 A g−1 for 1700 cycles. As can be seen in Fig. 6c, a capacitance of 92.5% is retained after the consecutive cycling, suggesting excellent cycle performance of the carbon. As shown in the EIS, the ESR slightly increases from 0.65 to 0.71 ohm after cycling for 1700 times, indicating excellent stability and durability of the molten carbonate derived carbon. An appreciable increase in charge-transfer resistance appears after cycling, mainly due to irreversible oxidation of the partial carbon surface.
We attempted to test the practical applicability of the symmetric full-cell capacitor based on the molten carbonate derived carbon. The results are shown in Fig. 6d and the video enclosed in the ESI.† A LED lamp, which requires voltages higher than 3.6 V to become illuminated, was initially connected into an electrical circuit. Two full cells were used to illuminate the LED. Each individual coin full cell was initially charged to 2.0 V by CV scanning at a scan rate of 20 mV s−1. After being fully charged to 2.0 V, the two charged cells were quickly connected in serial and connected to the electric circuit. Upon connection, the LED lamp became illuminated and the duration of illumination state lasted for more than 1 minute.
Carbons are also building blocks for electrocatalysts applicable in fuel cells and metal–air batteries. The two MS derived carbons were then tested as electrocatalysts towards the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in O2-saturated 0.1 M aqueous KOH under hydrodynamic conditions (see ESI† for details).
As can be seen in the LSVs shown in Fig. 7a and b, a higher ORR current density occurs in the carbon derived from molten carbonate treatment. The K–L analysis of the LSVs of the two carbons at different rotating rates is shown in Fig. 7c and d, which was used to quantitatively understand the ORR activity (see ESI† for details).28 All the K–L plots exhibited good linearity. According to the K–L equations, electron transfer numbers per oxygen molecule (n) could be estimated from the slopes. An average electron transfer number of 3.33 occurred in the molten carbonate derived carbon, suggesting a predominance of the direct four-electron path for ORR over the sample. A smaller electron transfer number, i.e. 2.65 appears for the molten chloride derived carbon, indicating higher ORR kinetic barriers in the sample. Such a number also indicates the predominance of the two-electron ORR pathway in the sample. The enhanced electrocatalytic ORR activities of the molten carbonate-derived carbon can be addressed as follows. As mentioned above, the sample exhibits higher electrical conductivity than that of carbon derived from molten chlorides. Importantly, the molten chloride derived carbon possesses more oxygen-containing surface functional groups, which tend to retard the adsorption of O2 over the surface of carbon. An enhanced electrocatalytic activity towards the ORR hence appears in the molten chloride derived carbon.

Conclusions
In summary, carbonization of a typical waste biomass, i.e. boiled coffee beans, was both achieved in molten Na2CO3–K2CO3 (with equal mass) at 800 °C and molten CaCl2 at 850 °C. Characterizations verified that carbon powder derived from molten chlorides was of higher specific surface area, and possessed more oxygen-containing surface functional groups and a less ordered microstructure. This can be ascribed to the hydrolysis nature of CaCl2, leading to more O2− in molten CaCl2. O2− present in the melts resulted in more oxygen-containing surface groups and a less ordered microstructure for the MS derived carbon, which in turn caused deteriorated electrical conductivity, larger outer Helmholtz plane distances at electrochemical interfaces, and higher kinetic barriers for O2 adsorption over carbon. The above synthetic parameter–microstructure design rationales for MS carbonization of biomass towards carbon preparation for advanced electrochemical energy storage/conversion devices were evidenced by the enhanced capacitive properties and electrocatalytic activities towards ORR of the carbon derived from molten carbonate treatment.
