    , Accepted 15th March 2023First published on 16th March 2023AbstractThe electrochemical kinetics of the electrode material plays a crucial role in the development of various energy storage devices such as batteries, supercapacitors, and hybrid supercapacitors. Battery-type hybrid supercapacitors are envisaged as excellent candidates to bridge the performance gap between supercapacitors and batteries. Due to its open pore framework structure and more structural stability, porous cerium oxalate decahydrate (Ce2(C2O4)3·10H2O) is found here to be a potential energy storage material partly because of the presence of planer oxalate anions (C2O42−). Superior specific capacitance equivalent to 78 mA h g−1 (capacitance: 401 F g−1) at 1 A g−1 in the potential window of −0.3 to 0.5 V was observed in an aqueous 2 M KOH electrolyte. The predominant pseudocapacitance mechanism seems to operate because of the high charge storage capacity of the electrode as intercalative (diffusion control) and surface control charges stored by the porous anhydrous Ce2(C2O4)3·10H2O, which were close to 48% and 52%, respectively, at a 10 mV s−1 scan rate. Further, in the full cell asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) mode in which porous Ce2(C2O4)3·10H2O is the positive electrode and activated carbon (AC) is the negative electrode, at the operating potential window of 1.5 V, the highest specific energy of 96.5 W h kg−1 and a specific power of ∼750 W kg−1 at 1 A g−1 current rate and a high power density of 1453 W kg−1, the hybrid supercapacitor still attains an energy density of 10.58 W h kg−1 at a 10 A g−1 current rate, which was obtained with a high cyclic stability. The detailed electrochemical studies confirm a high cyclic stability and a superior electrochemical charge storage property of porous Ce2(C2O4)3·10H2O making it a potential pseudocapacitive electrode for use in large energy storage applications.
Introduction
Sustainable renewable energy such as solar energy, wind energy, and tidal energy is now crucial for solving the fossil fuel crisis and the greenhouse effect.1,2 A reliable electrochemical highly-efficient energy storage/conversion device plays an important role in the practical application of that renewable energy. Supercapacitors are the most promising electrochemical energy storage device when compared to other electrochemical devices (such as batteries) because of their fast charge–discharge cycle, high power density, and long cycle life.3–5 The electrical double-layer capacitors (EDLC) and the pseudocapacitors are major energy storage processes that are required for supercapacitor applications. Electrostatically, the charges are adsorbed at the electrode–electrolyte interface for the EDLC, and the energy is stored via the surface redox reaction (faradaic law because of the charge transformation reaction involved) and intercalation of ions on the electrode surface (electrosorption/desorption) for the pseudocapacitors.6,7 Now more interest has been given to constructing the battery-type supercapacitor hybrid device (BSH), because of its higher energy density capabilities than that of the EDLC, and higher power density than that of the rechargeable batteries.8 Ruthenium(IV) oxide (RuO2) is an excellent material, that was the first reported material used for pseudocapacitor applications.9 Manganese oxide (MnO2·xH2O) was used as a capacitor in a neutral electrolyte.10 Other transition metal oxides and non-oxide-based materials have also been used as pseudocapacitive charge storage materials.11–17
According to the charge storage mechanism, pseudocapacitive electrodes are able to access different oxidation states for the redox charge transfer/interactions of ions (K+, Li+, and Na+) to achieve a higher energy density compared to that of EDLC in a basic/neutral electrolyte.18–28 The asymmetrical cell gives a higher energy density performance because the capacitor component stores electrochemical energy using electrostatic force, and the battery component enhances the electron transfer/ion intercalation in the hybrid electrode system, and performs better charge transfer reactions at high rates.29
Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) have an interesting open framework structure where materials are constructed by joining metal-containing units with organic linkers, using strong bonds with permanent porosity.23 Highly porous metal oxalate frameworks show battery-type faradaic pseudocapacitive characteristics. A reversible surface redox/ion intercalation reaction mechanism was observed for charge storage on a material containing an active redox couple for charge transfer.30–38 In this work, we have successfully synthesised hydrated Ce2(C2O4)3·10H2O. An electrochemical study was carried out using an aqueous electrolyte for pseudocapacitor applications. Porous Ce2(C2O4)3·10H2O was synthesised by single-step process, and after co-precipitation, the synthesised power was dried at 80 °C for 3 h. The specific capacity value was 78 mA h g−1 (capacitance: 401 F g−1) at 1 A g−1 for a porous anhydrous Ce2(C2O4)3·10H2O electrode in an aqueous 2 M KOH electrolyte. Furthermore, the aqueous ASCs were fabricated, where porous Ce2(C2O4)3·10H2O was made as a positive electrode and AC was used as a negative electrode. The highest specific energy was 96.5 W h kg−1 and the specific power was ∼750 W kg−1 at 1 A g−1, by using the combination of porous anhydrous Ce2(C2O4)3·10H2O and AC to give high cyclic stability. Synthesis, characterisations and the detailed electrochemistry of the developed porous Ce2(C2O4)3·10H2O electrode are presented in this paper.
Experimental
Synthesis
Synthesis of highly porous Ce2(C2O4)3·10H2O was performed using a precipitation method. The Ce(NO3)3·6H2O was dissolved in 200 ml of deionised water with continuous stirring on a hot plate magnetic stirrer, and 1.27 g of oxalic acid dehydrate (H2C2O4·2H2O) was added in stoichiometric ration in the solution. The entire mixture was stirred vigorously at 80 °C for 3 h. After 3 h of stirring, a white coloured precipitate of Ce2(C2O4)3·10H2O was obtained. This product was then washed several times with deionised water. Finally, the washed Ce2(C2O4)3·10H2O was dried overnight in a hot air oven at 90 °C. The formation of cerous oxalate is presented in eqn (1): Ce(NO3)3·6H2O + H2C2O4·2H2O → Ce2(C2O4)3·10H2O↓ + 2HNO3 + 2H2O(1)
Characterisations
The crystal structure and phase purity of the synthesised product were characterised using a Rigaku MiniFlex desktop X-ray diffractometer (XRD) with Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 0.154 nm) in the 2θ range equal to 5–50° with a step size of 0.02°. PANalytical X’pert High Score software was used to identify the required phase. A field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) (FP 5022/22) was used to determine the surface morphology and structure of the sample. The infrared spectra of the samples were recorded using a Nicolet iS 5 FTIR spectrometer in the range of 400 to 4000 cm−1. Pore size distribution and specific surface area of the sample were measured using Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area measurement with a MicrotracBEL instrument. All the electrochemical performances of the sample including cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were conducted using a conventional three-electrode arrangement and were measured using a Metrohm Autolab PGSTAT204 equipped with an EIS FRA32M module. The electrochemical measurements were analysed using NOVA 1.1 software.
Preparation of the electrode
Hydrated Ce2(C2O4)3·10H2O working electrodes were prepared using a 7:2:1 ratio of active material, AC, and binder (poly(vinylidene fluoride), PVDF) in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) solvent. The homogenous slurry was prepared in a mortar, and slurry the (∼1 mg) was cast over a 1 cm2 area of Toray carbon paper. The coated electrode was dried at 80 °C for 12 h.
Results and discussions
The XRD pattern of the powder sample confirmed the single-phase formation of Ce2(C2O4)3·10H2O. Fig. 1a shows the Rietveld refined XRD pattern of the prepared sample with a 2θ range of 5–50° with a step size of 0.02°. The diffraction peaks appeared at 7.4, 12.9, 16.59, 17.35, and 24.6° (shown in the black curve), which corresponded to the (110), (−110), (011), (−111), and (120) planes of Ce2(C2O4)3·10H2O (JCPDS File No. 20-0268), respectively, with a monoclinic phase (space group: P21/c No: 14) with lattice parameters of a (Å) = 11.3470, b (Å) = 9.6300, c (Å) = 10.3920 α = γ 90°, β = 114.5°.39,40Fig. 1b shows the VESTA image of the Ce2(C2O4)3·10H2O powder sample.

Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was used to quantify the amount of monoclinic Ce2(C2O4)3·10H2O (see Fig. 1c). The first weight loss occurred between 100 and 165 °C, which corresponded to the removal of structural water. The TGA curve confirmed a weight loss of 29% as 10 moles of water were removed from the sample in this temperature range. Similarly, the second weight loss step occurred between 244–304 °C in which a weight loss of 32% was observed due to the decomposition of Ce2(C2O4)3. The weight losses can be represented as: Ce2(C2O4)3·10H2O → Ce2(C2O4)3 + 2H2O (above T = 110 °C)(2) Ce2(C2O4)3 → 2CeO2 + 4CO2 + 2CO (above T = 300 °C)(3)

Fig. 1d shows the comparative XRD profile of the intermediate phase of Ce2(C2O4)3·10H2O and the CeO2 phase prepared after the TGA study. The Ce2(C2O4)3·10H2O precipitates in the monoclinic phase (space group: P21/c No. 14) whereas the CeO2 was synthesised in a face-centred cubic lattice (space group: Fmm (225), (JCPDS File No. 34-0394).
The FTIR spectra of Ce2(C2O4)3·10H2O powder samples, shown in Fig. 2a, revealed the presence of different functional groups at different wavenumbers (cm−1). The broad peak at 3347.05 cm−1 was ascribed to the stretching vibration of the hydroxyl group (–OH/H2O) which signified the presence of water in the compound. The peak observed at 1620.75 cm−1 was assigned to the anti-symmetric carbonyl stretching band (CO) which is specific to the oxalate group. Two weak peaks at 1363.73 cm−1 and 1316.61 cm−1 were attributed to the vibrations of C2O4−2: (C–O) + (C–C) and (C–O) + (O–CO), respectively. The peak at 794.77 cm−1 was assigned to the vibration mode of C2O4−2, O–CO bending vibrations (O–CO). The absorption peak at 492.05 cm−1 is assigned to the Ce–O bonding present in the prepared sample of Ce2(C2O4)3·10H2O.41

A comparative FT-Raman study of Ce2(C2O4)3·10H2O powder was carried out and the results are shown in Fig. 2b which shows the FT-Raman spectra of Ce2(C2O4)3·10H2O before and after electrochemical testing. Peaks at 175.69 cm−1 and 235.51 cm−1 represent the corresponding Ce–O symmetry stretching, and a peak at 327.70 cm−1 represents the corresponding Ce–O asymmetry stretching. One phonon in longitudinal optical (LO) mode was observed in the Ce2(C2O4)3·10H2O powder in different frequency regions. The LO mode was observed in Ce2(C2O4)3·10H2O powder at 497.26 cm−1. The combined one phonon in LO mode and one phonon in transverse optical (TO) mode was observed at 921.92 cm−1 for Ce2(C2O4)3·10H2O powder.27 The high-intensity peak at 1491.74 cm−1 was associated with a two-magnon band that arises from the Ce3+–O2–Ce3+ vibration which confirmed the existence of the Ce2(C2O4)3·10H2O phase. The Raman bands were observed at 1624.6 cm−1 for Ce2(C2O4)3·10H2O and this corresponded to the G band that arose due to the C–C bond stretching vibration in the graphitic plane. Symmetrical stretching in the carboxylic functional group second-order disorder peaks 2D′ appeared at 3357.9 cm−1 in the Ce2(C2O4)3·10H2O sample. Thus, the FT-Raman study confirmed the effective formation of Ce2(C2O4)3·10H2O.38,41,42

Fig. 2c shows the BET results of the Ce2(C2O4)3·10H2O sample. The N2 adsorption and desorption isotherms show characteristics which correspond to the mesoporous structure for the Ce2(C2O4)3·10H2O sample. The calculated BET specific surface area and average pore diameters were 54.37 m2 g−1, and both micropores and mesopores had diameters of 1.72 nm to 4.58 nm, respectively. The mesopore structures have excellent electrochemical reactions due to the high porosity. The calculated mesopore diameters of the Ce2(C2O4)3·10H2O sample were much larger than the ions present in the aqueous electrolytes.
The HR-SEM image of the powder sample is shown in Fig. 3a. The shape and morphology of the Ce2(C2O4)3·10H2O powder sample was columnar. The elemental analysis of Ce2(C2O4)3·10H2O was preformed using energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX) and the results are shown in Fig. 3b. Fig. 3c–e show the elemental distribution of C, Ce, and O in the sample, respectively. The HR-TEM image shows the atomic arrangements at localised regions within the Ce2(C2O4)3·10H2O materials (Fig. 4a). The columnar shaped crystallites were present in the sample, and the lattice fringes were clearly visible in the inverse fast Fourier transform (FFT) mapping of this region (mapped with Gatan Digital Micrograph software), which confirmed the crystalline nature of the sample. Fig. 4a(i–iii) show the FFT and the inverse FFT. Fig. 4b shows the interplanar distance, and the d spacing value was found to be 0.663 nm for the (−111) plane (calculated using Gatan Digital Micrograph software). The lattice fringe spacing results was in agreement with the interplanar spacing obtained from the XRD studies.

Fig. 5a shows the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) survey of the Ce2(C2O4)3·10H2O sample, which further confirmed the presence of Ce. In the Ce3d spectrum shown in Fig. 5b, four main peaks corresponding to the spin-orbit splitting and 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 appear in the Ce3d(III) spectrum. The highest binding energy peaks at 885.59 eV and 904.65 eV represent the final state of the Ce3d94f1 O2p6, and the lowest binding energy states located at 882.44 eV and 900.99 eV, were the Ce of the 3d94f2 O2p5 state.43,44

The C1s spectrum shown in Fig. 5c represents the C–C/CC type carbon (C1s) binding energy at 284.22 eV, and the binding energies for the C–O and CO type carbon (C1s) at 285.16 eV and 288.34eV, respectively. The high-resolution O1s XPS spectrum is shown in Fig. 5d. The predominant peaks at the binding energies of 531.15, 531.8, and 532.7 eV are associated with the C–O, CO, and lattice H2O type oxygen (O1s), respectively.33,36,37
Electrochemical studies
All the electrochemical tests were performed in 2 M KOH electrolyte, where the Ce2(C2O4)3·10H2O and CeO2, obtained from the TGA studies of the cerium oxalate, were utilised as the working electrodes, using a three-electrode system, where saturated Hg/HgO (1 M KOH) was used as a reference electrode, and a platinum wire was used as the counter electrode. A CV curve was obtained in the potential range of −0.3 V to 0.5 V for a half-cell. Fig. 6a shows a comparative CV plot for Ce2(C2O4)3·10H2O and the CeO2 phase at 5 mV s−1. Fig. 6b shows the CV curve of Ce2(C2O4)3·10H2O, and the nature of the curve suggested pseudocapacitive charge storage behaviour utilising (electrosorption) by means of diffusion-controlled intercalative storage coupled with surface redox. The redox peaks originated due to the reversible transformation between Ce3+ to Ce4+ with the electrosorption (redox) of the OH− ion.45–47 Ce2(III)(C2O4)3·10H2O + 2OH−so ↔ Ce(IV)(OH−)C2O4·2H2O + 2e−(4)

From the CV curve, the specific capacitance C (F g−1) could also be calculated using eqn (5) as one of the significant parameters to understand the electrochemical performance of the working electrode:48 (5)
The specific capacity C (mA h g−1) could also be calculated by modifying eqn (5): (6)where m is the mass of active material in the electrode (g), V is the potential window (V), and ϑ is the scan rate (mV s−1).
The specific capacities of Ce2(C2O4)3·10H2O and CeO2 were calculated using eqn (6), and the capacities were found to be 52 mA h g−1 (capacitance: 278 F g−1) and 15.73 mA h g−1 (capacitance: 70.8 F g−1) at 1 mV s−1. Fig. 6c shows the linear relationship between the anodic and cathodic peak currents with respect to the square root of the scan rate, which indicate that Ce2(C2O4)3·10H2O exhibited a semi-infinite diffusion-controlled process. Furthermore, the kinetics of the redox reaction of the electrode could be understood by determining the diffusion coefficient. The diffusion coefficient for the electrode was determined using the Randles–Sevcik equation (eqn (7)):49 ip = 2.686 × 105 × n3/2AD1/2C0v1/2(7)where ip is the peak current (A), n is the number of electrons transferred in the redox event (usually 1), A is electrode area (cm2), D is the diffusion coefficient (cm2 s−1), C0 is the OH− ion concentration (mol cm−3), and ν is scan rate (V s−1). The diffusion coefficient of OH− for the Ce2(C2O4)3·10H2O electrode was found to be 0.416 × 10−11 cm2 s−1 for oxidation, and 1.8931 × 10−11 cm2 s−1 for the reduction reaction. To qualitatively understand the electrochemical kinetics of the different charge storage properties of the electrode, the power-law equation (eqn (8)) was utilised: i = avb(8)where a and b are adjustable values, i is the current (A), and ν is the scan rate (V s−1). The value of b lies between 0.5 to 1, b = 0.5 represents a semi-infinite diffusion-controlled reaction, i.e., a battery type material, whereas b = 1 represents a surface control reaction. Fig. 7a shows the slope (b value) of the corresponding log peak current (ip) vs. log (v) plots. The b value of the oxidative and reductive currents were found to be 0.569 and 0.555, respectively, which indicated the dominance of the semi-infinite diffusion-controlled processes for the battery type supercapacitor materials during the electrochemical reaction.50

(a) The b value plot of the linear relationship between log (peak current) and log (scan rate) at two different scan rate regions, (b) a plot of the power law at the charged state (during charging) and discharged states (during discharge) at a potential, (c) the contribution of the diffusive and capacitive contributions at different scan rates. 

Fig. 7b shows that the voltammetry sweep rate dependence can distinguish quantitatively, the capacitive contribution to the current response. The current response at a fixed potential is the combination of two separate mechanisms, surface capacitive effects and diffusion-controlled insertion:51 (9)
For greater understanding, eqn (9) was modified: (10)
From eqn (9), k1ν and k2ν1/2 explain the current contributions from the surface capacitive effects and the diffusion-controlled intercalation process, respectively. Thus, after the determination of k1 and k2, it was possible to quantify the fraction of the current due to each of these contributions at specific potentials.
Linear fitting of the curve was carried out to determine the k1 and k2 values from the slope, and the intercept of the y-axis. The representative curve of i(V)/ν1/2vs. ν1/2 in Fig. 7b represents the contribution of the surface capacitance and the diffusion-controlled interaction process at different scan rates in Fig. 7c. In Fig. 6c, after determining the k1 and k2 values, which represent the contribution of surface capacitance (52%) and diffusion-controlled interaction (48%), respectively, at a peak potential of 0.317 V and at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1.
The GCD experiments were performed to obtain a more accurate capacitance assessment of the Ce2(C2O4)3·10H2O electrodes. From the charge–discharge curve, the specific capacitance of the electrode could be calculated using eqn (11):48 (11)
The specific capacity of the electrode was calculated by modifying eqn (11), as shown in eqn (12): (12)where I is the discharge current (A), Δt is the discharge time (s), m is the mass of the active material in the electrode (g), and ΔV is the potential change during discharge (V).

Fig. 8a shows a comparative GCD curve of Ce2(C2O4)3·10H2O, and the CeO2 electrodes at a 1 A g−1 current rate. The specific capacities of the Ce2(C2O4)3·10H2O and CeO2 electrodes were found to be 78 mA h g−1 (capacitance: 401 F g−1) and 23 mA h g−1 (capacitance: 103.5 F g−1), respectively. Fig. 8b shows that the specific capacities of Ce2(C2O4)3·10H2O were 78 mA h g−1 (capacitance: 401 F g−1), 37 mA h g−1 (capacitance: 190 F g−1), 26 mA h g−1 (capacitance: 133 F g−1) and 15 mA h g−1 (capacitance: 77.2 F g−1) at current densities of 1, 2, 3 and 5 A g−1, respectively. It was observed that with an increase in current density, there was a decrease in the specific capacitance. Fig. 8c shows the capacitance of the highly porous Ce2(C2O4)3·10H2O electrode at different constant current rates and for different cycle numbers. In addition to the electrochemical stability tests, we performed impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements in the frequency range of 100 kHz–0.1 Hz as shown in the Nyquist plot at 10 mV in Fig. 8d. The specific impedance contribution is mainly attributed to the impedance distributions over the electric series resistance (Rs), charge transfer resistance (Rct), and Warburg impedance (Rw). There was a higher frequency resistance for the Ce2(C2O4)3·10H2O electrodes, and the intercept of the EIS spectra on the real axis was at 2.36 Ω, which indicated a very small internal resistance. Lower frequency data represented the Warburg diffusion resistance for samples. The slope of the straight line of the porous Ce2(C2O4)3·10H2O electrode in the low-frequency region was close to a 45° angle (very close to –Z′′ (Ω) axis) from the horizontal line which was more representative of the characteristics of a battery or diffusion-controlled capacitance behaviour of the Ce2(C2O4)3·10H2O electrode. This also represented fast OH− ion diffusion in the porous structure of the electrode.52

A Bode plot of the phase angle (φ) as a function of frequency can be used to visualise the relative contributions of capacitive and resistive elements, because it suggests ideal capacitance behaviour at φ = 90° and ideal battery type behaviour at φ = 45° The Bode plot shown in Fig. 8e shows the phase angle of the Ce2(C2O4)3·10H2O electrode with respect to the applied frequency between 100 kHz to 0.1 Hz. The phase angle of the Ce2(C2O4)3·10H2O electrode was found to be 49.5° which suggests it has predominantly battery-type charge storage behaviour. Fig. 8f shows the excellent long-term cycle stability of highly porous anhydrous Ce2(C2O4)3·10H2O electrodes at the current rate of 10 A g−1 for 5000 cycles. It was observed that there was 87% of the capacity retention after 5000 cycles which indicated that the specific capacitance was not changed after long cycling, and showed the applicability of the framework structure to make robust electrodes. Simultaneously, the plot also displays the superior coulombic efficiency  of electrode which was close to 95.3% after 5000 cycles of charge/discharge which revealed the high reversibility of the Ce2(C2O4)3·10H2O electrode.
Two electrode tests in full cell hybrid supercapacitor mode
To understand the real charge storage behaviour or the applicability of the porous Ce2(C2O4)3·10H2O sample relative to AC, two electrode measurements were conducted in 2 M KOH. To determine the maximum performance of the cell during the full test, the storage capacities of the positive and negative electrode need to be balanced as shown in eqn (13): (13)
For balancing the charge storage capacity of the cell, the mass ratio (m+/m−) of the positive and negative electrode material was estimated using eqn (14): (14)where m+, m−, C+, C−, ΔE+, and ΔE− are mass, specific capacitance, and potential windows of positive and negative electrodes, respectively, estimated by three-electrode measurement.29,30

Fig. 9a shows the respective CV curves for AC and porous Ce2(C2O4)3·10H2O positive electrodes at a 10 mV s−1 scan rate. The calculated mass ratio  was kept at 1:1.2 for the asymmetric cell, the weight of the positive material was 2.12 mg (active material: Ce2 (C2O4)3·10H2O (1.48 mg):acetylene black (0.42 mg):PVDF (0.22 mg)) and the mass of the negative electrode (AC) was 2.38 mg, resulting in an overall cell mass equal to 4.49 mg. Fig. 9b shows the CV curve of the porous Ce2(C2O4)3·10H2O//AC cell in two electrodes in ASC mode at the scan rate of 1 mV s−1 to 100 mV s−1 in the operating potential window of 1.5 V. Fig. 9c subsequently shows the GCD profile obtained for measuring the actual capacity of the cell. The cell's capacitance was calculated using eqn (12) and the values were found to be 129 mA h g−1 (capacitance: 309 F g−1), 77 mA h g−1 (capacitance: 184 F g−1), 51 mA h g−1 (capacitance: 122 F g−1), 30 mA h g−1 (capacitance: 72 F g−1), and 15 mA h g−1 (capacitance: 36 F g−1) at the current densities of 1 A g−1, 2 A g−1, 3 A g−1, 5 A g−1 and 10 A g−1, respectively. In Fig. 9d, the EIS plot (Nyquist) is shown in the frequency range of 1 MHz to 0.1 Hz at the scan rate of 10 mV s−1 and it shows a higher charge transformation, resulting in higher capacitance for the full cell (Ce2 (C2O4)3·10H2O//AC). The impedance distributions over the Rs, Rct, and Rw were obtained, and the higher frequency resistance and the intercept of the EIS spectra on the real axis were found to be 6.2 Ω and 16.4 Ω, respectively, indicating there was a very small internal resistance for the Ce2(C2O4)3·10H2O electrode. The lower frequency data represent the Rw for samples and the slope of the straight line of the porous Ce2(C2O4)3·10H2O electrode in the low-frequency region was close to a 45° angle (very close to the Z′′(Ω) axis) from the horizontal line which represents the characteristic of the diffusion-controlled battery type charge storage behaviour of the porous Ce2(C2O4)3·10H2O electrode.43 The Bode plot shown in Fig. 9e illustrates the phase angle of the Ce2(C2O4)3·10H2O electrode with respect to the applied frequency between 100 kHz to 0.1 Hz. The phase angle of the full cell (AC//Ce2(C2O4)3·10H2O) was found to be 50.09° which suggested that predominant charge storage mechanism in the full cell was battery type. In Fig. 9f, the plot showed the Coulombic efficiency of two electrode full cells had only lost 4%, with a higher capacity retention which was close to 92.6% of its initial value after 2000 cycles.

The specific energy and specific power of the asymmetric capacitors were calculated using the following eqn (15) and (16): (15) (16)where CASCs is the specific capacitance, V is the operating voltage and tdis is the discharge time.44Fig. 9g shows the plot of specific energy vs. specific power at different constant current rates. The cell gives the highest specific energy of 96.5 W h kg−1 at 1 A g−1 current density with the specific power reaching ∼750 W kg−1. A maximum specific power of ∼1453 W kg−1 was obtained when the specific energy was reduced to ∼10.58 W h kg−1 at a current density of 10 A g−1. Fig. 10a shows a comparative XRD Ce2(C2O4)3·10H2O powder sample before and after the electrochemical study, and similarly, Fig. 10b shows the HR-SEM study of the Ce2(C2O4)3·10H2O powder sample before and after the electrochemical study. The studies clearly show the stability of the electrode material after the electrochemical tests. The robust oxalate framework structure resulted in the higher structural stabilities of the electrode which resulted in the superior and robust charge storage properties of the electrode.

Conclusions
In summary, Ce2(C2O4)3·10H2O powder was successfully synthesised by a co-precipitation method, and was characterised by powder XRD, SEM/HR-TEM, FTIR, and Raman spectroscopy. The electrode showed diffusion-controlled pseudocapacitive charge storage and exhibited a specific capacity of 78 mA h g−1 (capacitance: 401 F g−1) at a current density of 1 A g−1 and had excellent cyclic stability. Comparative performances of different metal-oxalate-based electrodes are summarised in Table 1. The predominant intercalative diffusion-controlled pseudocapacitive charge storage mechanism seems to be operative behind the high charge storage capacity of the electrode and the contribution for intercalative (diffusion-controlled) and surface-controlled charges stored on the porous anhydrous Ce2(C2O4)3·10H2O were found to be 48% and 52%, respectively, at a 10 mV s−1 scan rate. A porous Ce2(C2O4)3·10H2O//AC full cell resulted in 96.5 W h kg−1 of maximum specific energy with a specific power equivalent to 750 W kg−1 in a voltage window of 1.5 V in 2 M KOH electrolyte at a current rate of 1 A g−1. These results confirm that the porous Ce2(C2O4)3·10H2O electrode could be applied as a potential pseudo-capacitive electrode for large energy storage applications.
