    , Accepted 28th April 2016First published on 28th April 2016AbstractMicrobes can reduce CO2 into multicarbon chemicals with electrons acquired from the cathode of a bioelectrochemical reactor. This bioprocess is termed microbial electrosynthesis (MES). One of the main challenges for the development of highly productive MES reactors is achieving efficient electron transfer from the cathode to microbes. Here, carbon cloth cathodes modified with reduced graphene oxide functionalized with tetraethylene pentamine (rGO-TEPA) were readily self-assembled in the cathodic chamber of a MES reactor. Electroactive biofilms with unique spatial arrangement were subsequently formed with Sporomusa ovata at the surface of rGO-TEPA-modified electrodes resulting in a more performant MES process. The acetate production rate from CO2 was increased 3.6 fold with the formation of dense biofilms when wild type S. ovata was combined with rGO-TEPA. An improvement of 11.8 fold was observed with a highly structured biofilm including multiple spherical structures possibly consisting of bioinorganic networks of rGO-TEPA and bacterial cells from a novel strain of S. ovata adapted to reduce CO2 faster. The three dimensional biofilms observed in this study enabled highly effective electric interactions between S. ovata and the cathode, demonstrating that the development of dense cathode biofilms is an effective approach to improve MES productivity.
Introduction
Bioelectrochemical systems (BESs) have been developed recently to provide electrons to acetogenic bacteria for the reduction of the greenhouse gas CO2 into commodity chemicals.1–4 This process named microbial electrosynthesis (MES) can be powered by renewable sources of electricity such as solar and wind effectively storing electrical energy in chemical bonds.1,2 MES can also be coupled with useful anodic reactions to combine chemical production with environmental cleaning processes.5 This includes fatty acid oxidation in wastewaters and removal of sulphide from contaminated water.6–8 When powered by a solar cell, MES effectively becomes a bioinorganic photosynthesis apparatus with large potential for improved solar energy-to-chemical conversion efficiency compared to natural photosynthesis-based bioenergy strategies.2,9
In MES systems, electrons are transferred from the cathode to the microbe. Multiple approaches have been developed to optimize microbe–cathode interactions with the aim of increasing electron transfer rates and productivity.1 These efforts mainly focused on modifying the surface or the spatial arrangement of the cathode electrode to augment its catalytic activity, its porosity, the strength of electrostatic interactions with negatively charged bacteria or the surface-area-to-volume-ratio.10–13
Reduced graphene oxide (rGO) is a two dimensional, honeycombed, and one-atom-thick carbon material with many outstanding characteristics such as low production cost, high electronic conductivity, low charge-transfer resistance, large specific surface area, and exceptional mechanical strength and biocompatibility14–18 that could be beneficial for MES productivity and scalability. Graphene-based materials have been used to modify the anode of BESs resulting in significant improvement of electrical power generation.15,19–21 Recently, rGO was also used to improve electron transfer from the cathode electrode of a BES reactor to a microbial catalyst.22
One potential disadvantage of employing rGO in BESs is that it is negatively charged which could limit electrostatic interaction strength with bacterial cells that typically have a negative surface charge.23,24 Recently, rGO has been functionalized with tetraethylene pentamine (TEPA), a positively charged molecule containing amino groups (Scheme 1). So far, rGO-TEPA has been used mainly for the fabrication of nonenzymatic immunosensors designed to measure squamous cell carcinoma antigen, carcinoembryonic antigen or secretoneurin.25–27 In these systems, the presence of TEPA promoted rGO stability and enabled the formation of covalent bonds with antibodies that captured the targeted antigens.
 Scheme 1  The rGO-TEPA CC biocathode fabrication and configuration. In the first step, only rGO-TEPA is injected into the cathodic chamber. In the second step, both rGO-TEPA and S. ovata cells are injected probably resulting in the formation of a bioinorganic network. The graphic elements of this Scheme are not to scale. 
Here, a rGO-TEPA modified carbon cloth (CC) cathode electrode (rGO-TEPA-CC) was developed by a simple self-assembly method to explore its impact on the performance of Sporomusa ovata-driven MES systems. Negatively charged S. ovata strains were incorporated into the positively charged matrix of rGO-TEPA with the aim of forming 3D intertwined biofilms at the cathode surface (Scheme 1) enabling faster electron transfer as well as higher MES productivity. Two S. ovata strains were tested with the rGO-TEPA-CC electrode, which include wild type S. ovata DSM-2662 and a novel S. ovata strain that was recently developed by methanol adaptation (strain met) that reduces CO2 faster and performs better for MES.28
Results and discussion
Negatively charged S. ovata
Pure culture of the acetogen S. ovata was employed in this study as the microbial catalyst because it is one of the best acetate producers from CO2 by MES.2,12,13,28 It has been assumed that S. ovata like other bacteria is negatively charged at physiological pH.13,24,29 To demonstrate it experimentally, the zeta potential of the wild type strain and strain met was measured at a pH of 7.4 and an OD545 of 1.0. The zeta potentials of the wild type and strain met were respectively −12.8 ± 1.6 mV and −10.2 ± 1.0 mV confirming that the surface of this species has a net negative charge.
Self-assembly of the rGO-TEPA CC cathode electrode
rGO-TEPA combines the advantageous characteristics for bioelectrochemical applications of rGO-based materials with being positively charged, which should promote stronger electrostatic interactions with the negatively charged surface of S. ovata. To fabricate a rGO-TEPA coated cathode electrode, 30 mg of rGO-TEPA was injected into the N2–CO2-sparged (80:20) cathodic chamber of a MES reactor filled with a sterile fresh 311 medium with a CC cathode poised at −690 mV vs. SHE under mild stirring (100 rpm) (Fig. 1A–B). After 8 hours, rGO-TEPA attached itself to the CC cathode as it visually became darker, while the electrolyte solution opacity significantly diminished (Fig. 1C). The presence of rGO-TEPA at the surface of the CC substrate was further confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) with the detection of N 1 s (binding energy, 400 eV) after the coating process (Fig. S1†). The observed nitrogen peak corresponds to the amino groups found in TEPA. Subsequently, the cathodic chamber was inoculated with S. ovata followed by an additional amendment of 20 mg rGO-TEPA causing the electrolyte solution to become dark again (Fig. 1D). 6 hours later, bacterial turbidity was observed and significantly less rGO-TEPA nanoparticles were found in the suspension (Fig. 1E). From that point on, data were collected to study MES reactions.

The cathodic chamber (A) containing only the CC cathode poised at a potential of −690 mV vs. SHE, (B) immediately after and (C) 8 hours after injecting rGO-TEPA nanoparticles, (D) immediately after inoculating with S. ovata and adding supplementary rGO-TEPA, and (E) 6 hours after inoculation of S. ovata. The changes in the clarity of the solution on panels C and E compared to B and D indicate that rGO-TEPA attached itself to the CC cathode. 
Microbial electrosynthesis with the rGO-TEPA-CC cathode and wild type S. ovata
The wild type S. ovata DSM-2662 was tested first to evaluate the impact of rGO-TEPA on MES performance. Compared to a CC MES reactor, the rGO-TEPA-CC MES reactor produced acetate 3.6 fold faster (Table 1, Fig. 2). The volumetric acetate production rate of the rGO-TEPA-CC MES system was 0.90 ± 0.15 mM day−1 (n = 3) compared to 0.25 ± 0.02 mM day−1 (n = 3) for the CC MES reactor (Table 1, Fig. 2). Current consumption was also increased accordingly by 3.6 fold, while a coulombic efficiency of 83 ± 4.0% was comparable to that of the unmodified CC cathode of 82 ± 3% (Table 1).

Electron transfer curves correspond to the acetate concentration in mM if all the electrons transferred were converted to acetate. Acetate production curves in mM correspond to the real progression of acetate concentration in the MES reactor detected by high-pressure liquid chromatography. Results shown are from a representative example of three replicate MES reactors. 
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) indicated the presence of a significant S. ovata biofilm at the surface of the rGO-TEPA-CC cathode, whereas only individual cells distributed scarcely could be observed with the unmodified CC cathode (Fig. 3). These results show that the presence of rGO-TEPA has a positive impact on biofilm formation by the negatively charged S. ovata. The increased biofilm density is probably responsible for the observed higher electron transfer rate and acetate production rate from CO2.

Highly structured biofilm and higher acetate production with the S. ovata strain met
A recent study by Tremblay et al. (2015) showed that the methanol-adapted strain met developed by adaptive laboratory evolution was significantly faster than S. ovata DSM-2662 at reducing CO2 into acetate with electrons derived from a graphite stick cathode electrode. When strain met was employed as the microbial catalyst in a MES reactor equipped with a rGO-TEPA-CC cathode, a cumulative positive effect on MES performance could be observed. The acetate production rate was increased 3.3 fold compared to that of the wild type S. ovata/rGO-TEPA-CC cathode MES system, 5.6 fold compared to that of the strain met/unmodified CC cathode MES system and 11.8 fold compared to that of the wild type S. ovata/unmodified CC cathode MES system (Table 1, Fig. 2 and 4). The volumetric production rate of acetate was 2.95 ± 1.27 mM day−1 (n = 3) for the rGO-TEPA-CC MES reactor driven by strain met with a coulombic efficiency of 83 ± 3%, whereas only 0.53 ± 0.01 mM day−1 of acetate was produced for the strain met-driven unmodified CC cathode MES system with a coulombic efficiency of 81 ± 5% (Table 1, Fig. 4). The current consumption was also significantly improved with augmentation between 3.4 and12.3-fold compared to the three other systems tested (Table 1, Fig. 2 and 4). Interestingly, an important current fluctuation was observed at day 6 with the rGO-TEPA CC MES reactor driven by strain met, which could be explained by transient changes in the metabolic activities of strain met.

Acetate production curves in mM correspond to the real progression of acetate concentration in the MES reactor detected by high-pressure liquid chromatography. Results shown are from a representative example of three replicate MES reactors. 
SEM images revealed a highly structured biofilm with unique features including the presence of multiple self-assembled spheres (diameter ca. 20–30 μm) formed by strain met cells and most probably rGO-TEPA nanoparticles (Fig. 5). Cells of the strain met that are associated with the spheres and also present along the carbon fibers formed a significantly denser biofilm with the rGO-TEPA-CC cathode than with the unmodified CC cathode (Fig. 5). The observed spherical shapes could be rGO-TEPA 3D mazes intertwined with bacteria or alternatively rGO-TEPA cores covered with S. ovata cells. Nonetheless, these spheres are possibly responsible for the higher acetate production rate and current consumption since these appendages probably increase the surface area available for electronic interactions between the microbes and cathode.

Interestingly, self-assembled spheres were formed only with strain met but not with the wild type strain (Fig. 3 and 5). A crystal violet assay showed that strain met grown autotrophically with H2 as the electron source interacted more strongly with rGO-TEPA than the wild type strain. In this assay, rGO-TEPA nanoparticles injected into growing S. ovata cultures were filtered before being washed with water to remove unattached cells and then stained with crystal violet, a dye binding to bacterial cells.30 When strain met was grown with rGO-TEPA, the OD580 of the filtrate after elution with 100% ethanol was 4.0 ± 0.3 (n = 3), whereas the OD580 was only 2.7 ± 0.2 (n = 3) when wild type S. ovata was grown with rGO-TEPA. When testing filtrates from the sterile 311 medium amended with rGO-TEPA or from strain met cultures without rGO-TEPA injection, the OD580 after alcohol-based elution was respectively 2.9 ± 0.1 (n = 3) and 2.6 ± 0.1 (n = 3). These results clearly indicate that contrary to the wild type, strain met under these growing conditions formed stronger bonds with rGO-TEPA resilient enough to prevent the cells from being washed out.
Besides mutations accelerating the reduction of CO2 into acetate via the Wood–Ljungdahl pathway, strain met also has other characteristics not found in the wild type involved in the development of higher resistance to methanol toxicity.28 This includes modifications of the cell wall which contains significantly less high-molecular weight lipopolysaccharides. Furthermore, strain met has mutations in gene coding for transporters as well as an altered expression profile for genes implicated in transport or cell wall maintenance. The difference in the cell wall could be responsible for the stronger interactions with rGO-TEPA nanoparticles and explain why spheres were formed only in the presence of strain met. Further research is warranted to understand the molecular mechanisms responsible for the formation of the highly structured biofilm observed in this study.
Experimental
Bacterial strains and growth conditions

Sporomusa ovata wild type DSM 2662 (ref. 31) was acquired from the Deutsche Sammlung Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen (DSMZ). S. ovata strain met was developed by adaptive laboratory evolution as described previously.28S. ovata strains were routinely maintained at 30 °C in a DSMZ 311 medium with 40 mM betaine as the substrate under a N2–CO2 (80:20) atmosphere. For autotrophic growth with H2 as the electron source and CO2 as the carbon source, the atmosphere was N2–CO2–H2 (83:10:7). For all growth conditions presented here, casitone, sodium sulfide, yeast extract, and resazurin were excluded from the 311 medium. For the MES experiment, cysteine was also excluded from the 311 medium.
Zeta potential
For the zeta potential measurement, S. ovata cultures were grown to a mid-log phase in the 311 medium with 40 mM betaine. Bacterial cells were washed 2 times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; pH of 7.4) before being resuspended in PBS at a final OD545 of 1.0. The zeta potential was measured with a Zetasizer Nano ZS (Malvern instrument, UK). Average and standard deviation values for each strain were calculated from 8 replicates.
Acetate production from CO2 by microbial electrosynthesis
Three-electrode and dual-chambered reactors were assembled for MES studies with S. ovata cultures grown in the cathodic chambers as previously described.28 The carbon cloth cathode (28 cm2) and graphite stick anode (36 cm2) were immersed in 250 ml of 311 medium without an electron donor. A Nafion 115 ion-exchange membrane (Ion Power, Inc., New Castle, DE, USA) was used to separate the two chambers. The cathode potential was set at −690 mV versus SHE with a potentiostat (ECM8, Gamry Instruments, PA, USA). The cathodic chamber was inoculated with 100 ml of cathode-grown culture of S. ovata wild type or strain met from an active MES reactor. After 6 hours of pre-incubation under a N2–CO2 (80:20) atmosphere with a cathode poised at −690 mV versus SHE, acetate measurements were started to study MES reactions. MES experiments were done in triplicate at room temperature and both the cathodic and anodic chambers were continually bubbled with N2–CO2 (80:20) to maintain anoxic conditions. Volumetric acetate production rates were calculated based on the electrolyte volume in the cathodic chamber of the MES reactor.
Fabrication of the rGO-TEPA CC cathode electrode and microbial electrosynthesis performance
Prior to exposure to rGO-TEPA, the CC cathode was pre-treated with concentrated HNO3 as described previously.13 rGO-TEPA purchased from Nanjing XFNANO Materials Tech Co. (Nanjing, China) was suspended in deionized water at a concentration of 1 mg ml−1 under a N2 atmosphere. 30 ml of the anoxic rGO-TEPA solution was injected into the cathodic chamber with a carbon cloth cathode poised at −690 mV versus SHE under a N2–CO2 (80:20) atmosphere with mild stirring (100 rpm). 8 hours after the initial injection, 100 ml of a S. ovata culture from an active MES reactor as well as an additional 20 ml rGO-TEPA were added to the poised cathodic chamber. 6 hours after the inoculation and after almost all the rGO-TEPA nanoparticles were captured by the poised cathode, the performance of the MES reactors was monitored and samples were taken for acetate concentration analysis.
High-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC)
Acetate concentrations in the electrolyte solution of operating MES reactors were measured with an HPLC apparatus equipped with a HPX-87H anion exchange column (Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc., California, USA) at a temperature of 30 °C, with 5 mM H2SO4 as the mobile phase at a flow rate of 0.6 ml min−1. Detection was done with a refractive index detector.
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
SEM images were taken with a scanning electron microscope (JEOL, Tokyo, Japan). Prior to SEM analysis, biocathode samples were fixed overnight at room temperature in 0.1 M phosphate buffer at pH 7.0 containing 2.5% glutaraldehyde. Then, the samples were dehydrated in a series of ethanol solutions (30%, 50%, 70%, 90% and 100%), and were washed a second time in acetonitrile as described previously.13 Air-dried samples were coated with gold and then observed at an accelerating voltage of 12 kV under high vacuum conditions.
Crystal violet assay
For crystal violet assays, S. ovata strains were grown autotrophically to the mid-log phase in the 311 medium with H2 as the electron donor in the presence or absence of 1 mg rGO-TEPA. Bacterial cultures were filtered with a Whatman grade 1 filter paper before being washed out with 3 ml deionized water. 100 μl of a 1% solution of crystal violet was deposited on the filter and the reaction mixture was incubated for 8 minutes at room temperature. Unattached crystal violet was removed by washing with 40 ml of deionized water. 2 ml of ethanol 100% was added to elute crystal violet bound to bacterial cells retained by the filter. OD580 of the ethanol eluates was then measured at least in triplicate for each experiment.
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)
The carbon surfaces of CC and rGO-TEPA CC electrodes were analyzed using a K-Alpha spectrometer (ThermoFisher Scientific, UK) with monochromatized 400 μm AlKα X-ray spots (pass energy: 200 eV for survey spectra).
Conclusions
A major bottleneck in the development of highly productive MES systems is the slow electron transfer rate from the cathode electrode to the microbial catalyst. Formation of dense and robust electroactive biofilms has been shown to improve electron transfer between microbial catalysts and anodes for electricity production by BESs.32–34 This has also been observed with mixed community driven-MES systems that produced a higher amount of acetate from CO2 in the presence of denser biofilms.11,35 With the simple and inexpensive method developed here, rGO-TEPA modified CC biocathodes quickly self-assembled in MES reactors. The presence of rGO-TEPA caused a substantial augmentation in biofilm density at the surface of cathode electrodes. This improved the performance of MES reactors by increasing electron transfer rates as well as CO2 to acetate conversion rates.
When the methanol-adapted strain met was employed as the microbial catalyst, a highly organized biofilm was formed in part by spherical structures probably made of S. ovata cells and rGO-TEPA. This unique biofilm achieved a higher acetate production rate and electron transfer rate than all the other MES systems tested in this study. It also compares advantageously to other MES systems driven by pure cultures equipped with different types of cathode electrodes reported previously.1,12,13,28,36 The beneficial impact on MES performance of this highly structured biofilm could be due to the greater surface area available for microbe-cathode interactions. Still, further investigation is required to discern all the mechanisms at work in this unique biofilm with high performance for the MES reaction.

Table Content:

 	Scheme 1  The rGO-TEPA CC biocathode fabrication and configuration. In the first step, only rGO-TEPA is injected into the cathodic chamber. In the second step, both rGO-TEPA and S. ovata cells are injected probably resulting in the formation of a bioinorganic network. The graphic elements of this Scheme are not to scale.	 

 	Fig. 1  Self-assembly of the rGO-TEPA CC cathode electrode. The cathodic chamber (A) containing only the CC cathode poised at a potential of −690 mV vs. SHE, (B) immediately after and (C) 8 hours after injecting rGO-TEPA nanoparticles, (D) immediately after inoculating with S. ovata and adding supplementary rGO-TEPA, and (E) 6 hours after inoculation of S. ovata. The changes in the clarity of the solution on panels C and E compared to B and D indicate that rGO-TEPA attached itself to the CC cathode.

 	Fig. 2  Electron transferred, acetate and current production with S. ovata wild type. (A) CC and (B) rGO-TEPA-CC cathode electrode. Electron transfer curves correspond to the acetate concentration in mM if all the electrons transferred were converted to acetate. Acetate production curves in mM correspond to the real progression of acetate concentration in the MES reactor detected by high-pressure liquid chromatography. Results shown are from a representative example of three replicate MES reactors.	 

 	Fig. 3  SEM images of the (A–B) CC cathode and (C–D) rGO-TEPA-CC cathode in the MES reactor driven by the S. ovata wild type.	 

 	Fig. 4  Electron transferred, acetate and current production with S. ovata strain met. (A) CC and (B) rGO-TEPA-CC cathode electrode. Electron transfer curves correspond to the acetate concentration in mM if all the electrons transferred were converted to acetate. Acetate production curves in mM correspond to the real progression of acetate concentration in the MES reactor detected by high-pressure liquid chromatography. Results shown are from a representative example of three replicate MES reactors.	 

 	Fig. 5  SEM images of the (A-B) CC cathode and (C–E) rGO-TEPA-CC cathode in the MES reactor driven by S. ovata strain met.
