    , Accepted 29th April 2021First published on 30th April 2021AbstractTwo water/alcohol soluble conjugated polymers (WSCPs), based on naphthalenediimide and amino-functionalized 3,4-(propylenedioxy)thiophene, were synthesized via direct arylation polycondensation (DArP). The polymers worked well as electron transporting layers (ETLs) for fullerene-based and fullerene-free organic solar cells (OSCs), presenting an enhancement by above 40% compared to the control devices, respectively. The doping properties and high electron mobilities of these WSCPs endow them with high performance. The research study developed an effective method to synthesize ETLs for highly efficient OSCs, which was rarely reported.
Bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs) have attracted considerable attention in recent years because of the great potential of producing light-weight and flexible devices via low-cost and large-scale solution processing.1,2 In particular, appreciable achievements have been made with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) higher than 18%.3,4 Obviously, electron transporting layers (ETLs) between the active layer and the cathode play important roles in enhancing the device performance, as appropriate ETLs not only reduce the interfacial barrier, but also passivate the surface defect of the electrode, thus reducing the leakage current, enhancing the charge injection, and improving the open-circuit voltage (Voc).5,6
Among various types of ETLs, water/alcohol-soluble conjugated polymers (WSCPs) including poly-[(9,9-bis(3′-(N,N-dimethylamino)propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene)] (PFN) and poly[(9,9-bis(3′-(N,N-dimethylamino)propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-5,5′-bis(2,2′-thiophene)-2,6-naphthalene-1,4,5,8-tetracaboxylic-N,N′-di(2-ethylhexyl)imide] (PNDITF3N) have been proven to be promising candidates for cathode modification and widely used in the state-of-the-art OSCs and perovskite solar cells.7–9 These WSCPs are usually synthesized by Suzuki cross-coupling polymerization between a dihaloarene monomer and a boric acid (ester) arene monomer. However, these techniques have the drawbacks of low atom economy, more synthetic steps and by-products. Excitingly, direct arylation polycondensation (DArP) can overcome these drawbacks.
DArP, a “greener” cross-coupling polymerization between a dihaloarene monomer and a non-substituted arene monomer, has been studied intensively and highlighted in organic electronics as a promising synthesis tool. As early as in 1999, Lemaire and co-workers were the first to transfer the direct arylation schemes for the aryl–aryl coupling of small molecules into polymer synthesis.10 After 2010, several reviews and perspective articles have been published on this topic, which essentially emerged and attracted enough attention.11–13 The improved atom economy, fewer synthetic steps, and the generation of only benign by-products of DArP are shining continuously throughout organic electronics.14,15 Meanwhile, the conjugated polymers synthesized via DArP are widely used in solar cells, transistors, light-emitting diodes, field-effect transistors, memory devices, electrochromic devices, and sensing technologies.16–18
According to the previous research, owing to their good electron transport properties, naphthalenediimide (NDI)-based WSCPs perform well in a wide thickness range as efficient ETLs for high-performance OSCs and p–i–n planar heterojunction perovskite solar cells.8,9 Therefore, NDI is a promising skeleton for the construction of novel WSCPs. The first synthesis of NDI-based polymers by DArP was reported by Horie and co-workers, however, yielding low number-average (Mn) products.19 Sommer and co-workers presented the defect-free NDI bithiophene copolymers of PNDIT2 from DArP with controlled high Mn, and the field-effect transistor devices exhibited better reproducibility compared to the Stille controls.20 The unique synthetic strategy of NDI polymers by DArP was widely developed, which inspires us deeply.21,22 The amino-functionalized 3,4-(propylenedioxy)thiophene (ProDOTN) is an excellent skeleton as a precursor to prepare WSCPs due to its block at the 3- and 4-positions of the thiophene rings, which prevents DArP defects (e.g., β-defects, branching, cross-linking, and homocoupling).23
Herein, we report an efficient DArP synthesis for the preparation of WSCPs of poly[3,3-bis((dimethylamino)methyl)-3,4-(propylenedioxy)thiophene]-alt-[2,6-naphthalene-1,4,5,8-tetracaboxylic-N,N′-di(2-ethylhexyl)imide] (PNDI-ProDOTN) and poly[3,3-bis((dimethylamino)methyl)-3,4-(propylenedioxy)thiophene]-alt-[2,6-naphthalene-1,4,5,8-tetracaboxylic-N,N′-di(2-ethylhexyl)imide] dibromide (PNDI-ProDOTNBr) as ETLs with high and controllable Mn for highly efficient OSCs (Scheme 1). NDI-ProDOTN was synthesized from the dibromo-substituted NDI (NDIBr2) and ProDOTN escorted by Pd2(dba)3·CHCl3, P(o-CH3Ph)3, pivalic acid, and CsCO3 in o-xylene. The molecular structure of all the materials was characterized by 1H NMR and 13C NMR (Fig. S1–S7 in the ESI†). It should be noted that PNDI-ProDOTN exhibits a broad single peak with a chemical shift of 4.10 ppm (Fig. S5, ESI†). This peak comprises the propane of ProDOTN (the monomer chemical shift is 4.01 ppm) and the adjacent CH2 of the NDI skeleton (the monomer chemical shift is 4.15 ppm). The chemical shift of 8.91 ppm is attributed to the NDI skeleton; the chemical shifts of about 2.50 and 2.25 ppm belong to the alkyl chains of ProDOTN; and the chemical shifts of about 2.05, 1.44 and 0.91 ppm are assigned to the alkyl chains of NDI. The Mn of resulting WSCPs is estimated to be 22.8 kDa, with a relevant polydispersity (Đ) of 2.4 as evaluated based on gel permeation chromatography by utilizing tetrahydrofuran as the eluent and linear polystyrene as the standard (Fig. S8 in the ESI†). Efforts have been made to achieve this controllable Mn WSCPs, which are summarized in Table S1 (ESI†).
 Scheme 1  Synthetic routes and chemical structures of PNDI-ProDOTN and PNDI-ProDOTNBr. 
PNDI-ProDOTNBr was obtained from the precursor polymer PNDI-ProDOTN with excess bromoethane in CHCl3 and MeOH mixed solution in darkness for 2 days. The thermal behavior was evaluated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning chromatography (DSC) (see Fig. S9 and S10, ESI†). Both WSCPs exhibit at least two main degradation processes with the onset degradation temperature at 330 °C and 221 °C, respectively. For PNDI-ProDOTNBr, the first mass loss is attributed to the decomposition of a quaternized ammonium group with the release of the ethyl bromide group. The second major degradation process is owing to the cleavage of the side chains, which is similar to the previous reports.24 DSC reveals no distinct exothermal transition in the second heating cycle over the temperature range of 30–300 °C for PNDI-ProDOTN and 30–180 °C for PNDI-ProDOTNBr, demonstrating that no crystalline behavior or phase transition occurred during these temperatures.

Fig. 1a shows the UV–vis absorption spectra of WSCPs both in solution and in thin films. Both WSCPs exhibit dramatically similar absorption spectra with two groups of peaks ranging from 300 to 400 nm and 450 to 700 nm, respectively. The mutual band at ca. 300–400 nm can be ascribed to the π–π* transition absorption, while the lowest energy band can be correlated to the intramolecular charge transfer that is analogous to the typical donor–acceptor type of conjugated polymers. The optical band gaps (Eoptg) of PNDI-ProDOTN and PNDI-ProDOTNBr, estimated from the absorption onsets of their corresponding thin films, are determined to be 1.85 and 1.82 eV, respectively. The CV curves are shown in Fig. 1b. PNDI-ProDOTN and PNDI-ProDOTNBr exhibit the oxidation process with the onset oxidation peaks at ca. 1.4 V. Besides, both WSCPs show the quasi-reversible reduction process; their low reduction onset potentials are located at −0.6 V for PNDI-ProDOTN and −0.4 V for PNDI-ProDOTNBr. These were undoubtedly beneficial for the realization of the n-doping process and are similar to those of the imide-based polymers.25 The half-wave potential of Fc/Fc+ was measured to be 0.36 V, and the energy levels of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) are estimated from the onset oxidation (Eonsetox) and reduction (Eonsetred) potentials using the following equations:26EHOMO = -e(Eonsetox − EFc/Fc+ + 4.8) and ELUMO = −e(Eonsetred − EFc/Fc+ + 4.8), respectively. The HOMO/LUMO levels are −5.84/−3.84 eV for PNDI-ProDOTN and −5.80/−4.04 eV for PNDI-ProDOTNBr (Table 1). The electron mobilities (μe) of both WSCPs were investigated in single-carrier devices with a device structure of ITO/ZnO/WSCPs/Ca/Al. μe was acquired by fitting J–V with the space–charge limited current (SCLC) model (Fig. S11, ESI†). The μe of PNDI-ProDOTN is 7.5 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, one order higher than that of PNDI-ProDOTNBr, indicating that PNDI-ProDOTN exhibits better charge transporting properties. The trend in the electron mobility also coincides well with the following mentioned result that PNDI-ProDOTN achieves a slightly better photovoltaic performance than PNDI-ProDOTNBr.16

Scanning kelvin probe microscopy was implemented to verify the modification capability of both WSCPs on the Ag electrode. The work function (WF) of bare Ag is measured to be 4.57 eV, and after the deposition of an ultrathin layer (5 nm) of PNDI-ProDOTN and PNDI-ProDOTNBr, WFs are decreased to 4.23 eV and 4.12 eV, respectively (Table 2). The changes in the WF of WSCPs modified Ag electrode mainly result from the interfacial dipole induced by the pendant polar groups on the WSCPs, leading to a better ohmic contact at the cathode.8,27 As the thickness increases to 20 nm, WFs further decrease to 4.12 eV and 4.10 eV, respectively, which is similar to the previous reports.28 When the thickness of WSCPs increases to 40 nm, PNDI-ProDOTN and PNDI-ProDOTNBr exhibit the same WFs of 4.06 eV. These results imply that the reduced work functions of the Ag electrode can lead to a more suitable energy level alignment, which is beneficial to collect electrons in OSC devices.

The devices were investigated by fabricating and evaluating conventional OSCs with the configuration of ITO/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)/active layer/WSCPs/Ag. In the fullerene system, poly[4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dit-hiophene-co-3-fluor-othieno[3,4-b]thiophene-2-carboxylate] (PTB7-Th) and [6,6]-phenyl C71butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) are used as the donor and acceptor. In this system, when 5 nm WSCPs are used as the ETLs, the devices derived from PNDI-ProDOTN and PNDI-ProDOTNBr exhibit the similarly improved photovoltaic efficiencies of 9.37%, and 9.17%, respectively (Fig. 2a and b). There are 39.6% and 36.7% improvements in comparison with the value of device without ETLs (6.71%), demonstrating that both WSCPs are promising ETLs for highly efficient OSCs. The device parameters of OSCs based on (PTB7-Th:PC71BM) with different thicknesses are listed in Table S1 (ESI†). Apart from the fullerene system, the fullerene-free system of poly[(2,6-(4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)-benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene))-alt-(5,5-(1′,3′-di-2-thienyl-5′,7′-bis(2-ethylhexyl)benzo[1′,2′-c:4′,5′-c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione))]:3,9-bis(2-methylene-(3-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)-indanone))-5,5,11,11-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)-dithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene (PBDB-T:ITIC) is studied to verify the universality of both WSCPs. PNDI-ProDOTN, with the thickness of 5 nm, exhibits the highest PCE of 10.4%, which has increased by 47.1% compared to the devices with no ETLs (7.07%, Fig. S12a and b, ESI†). The thickness of PNDI-ProDOTN increased to 40 nm, and the devices exhibit photovoltaic performance of 7.55%, which is much higher than that of the PNDI-ProDOTNBr based device (Table S1, ESI†). From the photovoltaic parameters of Table S1 (ESI†), Voc and FF exhibited slight changes with different thicknesses, indicating that a good ohmic contact was indeed formed.5,6 Meanwhile, the decrease of PCEs with increased thickness is mainly attributed to the decrease of the short-circuit current density (Jsc) not only in the fullerene system but also in the fullerene-free system, which can be explained by their external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra (Fig. 2c, d and Fig. S12c, d, ESI†). This may be attributed to the light absorption ability of ETLs. Both WSCPs of 5 nm thickness exhibit a maximum EQE of above 70% at 700 nm; however, the 40 nm WSCP based devices only show maximum EQE of about 60%.

The contact angles of water on the PNDI-ProDOTN and PNDI-ProDOTNBr surfaces were measured to investigate the hydrophilic properties. As seen in Fig. S13 (ESI†), the contact angles of PNDI-ProDOTN and PNDI-ProDOTNBr are 25.0° and 19.9°, respectively. The larger contact angles of water on PNDI-ProDOTN confirm that it is more hydrophobic than PNDI-ProDOTNBr, which is beneficial for the better ohmic contact with the hydrophobic active layer.29
The electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy of both WSCPs was implemented and the resulting curves are presented in Fig. 3a. The signal intensity of PNDI-ProDOTNBr is 30 times higher than that of PNDI-ProDOTN, exhibiting much higher self-doping properties in all WSCPs. The weak EPR signal from PNDI-ProDOTN can be attributed to both the high LUMO level of the polymer backbone and the weak electron-donating strength of the sidechain amine groups.30,31 We conducted electrical measurements under both dark and illuminated conditions based on an ITO/ETLs/Ag device structure to evaluate whether photoinduced doping was present in our systems. For PNDI-ProDOTN, when the device is illuminated, the current increases significantly by about 2.4-fold compared to the current in darkness at a bias of 1 V (Fig. 3b). The high photoconductivity of PNDI-ProDOTN can be explained by the photoinduced intramolecular electron transfer from the amino groups to the conjugated backbone of the polymer.26 For PNDI-ProDOTNBr, the corresponding devices exhibit high conductivity under both dark and illuminated conditions; it is very likely that self-doping had occurred within the material. We hypothesized that the electron from the bromine anion could transfer to the polymer and n-doped the conjugated backbone.8

In summary, we have synthesized two WSCPs consisting of NDI and ProDOTN by DArP. Both WSCPs exhibit self-doping properties, that is, the electron could transfer from the pendant polar group to the conjugated backbone. Furthermore, hydrophobic PNDI-ProDOTN, with high and controllable Mn, achieves higher PCEs for OSCs not only in the fullerene system but also in the fullerene-free system, which is beneficial for the better ohmic contact with the hydrophobic active layer and higher electron mobility. To the best of our knowledge, this is pioneering research towards the development of ETLs for highly efficient OSCs assisted by DArP.
