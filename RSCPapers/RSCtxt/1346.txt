    , Accepted 1st May 2015First published on 6th May 2015AbstractTiO2 mesoporous nanoparticles (NPs) doped with yttrium (Y) ions are fabricated via an environmentally friendly and facile solvothermal method to serve as a photoanode for dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy and N2 adsorption–desorption tests are used to characterize the influence of yttrium dopant on the properties of TiO2 NPs. The prepared Y-doped TiO2 NPs show the anatase phase and exhibit Ti–O–Y bonds. The photovoltaic performance is primarily associated with the morphological parameters of the NPs. At the optimum Y concentration of 3 at%, the short circuit current density increased from 13.20 to 15.74 mA cm−2, full sun solar power conversion efficiencies increased from 6.09% up to 7.61% as compared to the blank DSSC.
1. Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), invented by Grätzel,1 were designed as a sandwich structure which contained a photoanode, an electrolyte and a counter electrode. Over the last decade, the photoanode has been the target of numerous research efforts. Among the three components, the photoanode not only transports photo-induced electrons but also acts as a matrix to adsorb organic dyes, which directly determines the photo-current density.2 Among various candidates, TiO2 has been identified as a promising photoanode material and has been widely investigated.3–5 Generally, to effectively adsorb dyes, a large specific surface area (SSA) is necessary;6 therefore, various technologies have been developed to enlarge the SSA, such as micelles,7,8 block copolymers9 and ordered templates.10 Unfortunately, all those approaches need post-processing,11,12 which retard their application. Therefore, it is highly desirable to find a facile way to enlarge the SSA of TiO2 nano-powders. A mesoporous structure may be an option, not only offering a higher surface area (providing sites for adsorbing organic dyes), but also possessing linked walls for the diffusion of photo-induced electrons.
Rare earth elements (REEs) have been employed extensively in photocatalysis13–15 and selective catalytic reduction16 to improve the electron–hole (e–h) separation and to narrow the optical band gap of semiconductors for light harvesting.17–22 Typically, researchers have synthesized TiO2via Y doping and revealed that Y doping was helpful for the formation of oxygen vacancies for NO oxidation16 and photocatalysis.17 The role of REEs in DSSC photoanodes has also been discussed in several other publications.23–26 Light harvesting enhancement by dye adsorption or other ways and electron transport improvement are major aims to incorporate REEs into DSSCs. Jung et al.23 synthesized a Eu(III)-complex as an ultraviolet (UV) light-harvesting coadsorbent of DSSC and obtained a high short circuit photocurrent densities (JSC) of 17.72 mA cm−2 while that of the reference DSSC was 15.53 mA cm−2. G. B. Shan24 synthesized the Er3+/Yb3+ co-doped LaF3–TiO2 nanocomposite and applied it as the external up-conversion layer in the photoelectrode to harvest near infrared (NIR) light, improving the photocurrent with 2.4%. Zalas and Klein25 fabricated TiO2 films with lanthanide ions and reported that the RE-containing layer might act as an energy barrier preventing electron back-transfer. Zhang et al.26 increased the density of oxygen vacancies of TiO2 surface for dye adsorption by La doping and provided a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 6.72%, which was a 13.5% improvement compared with that of the reference cell. However, to the best of our knowledge, no report on mesoporous structure particles with REE doping for DSSC has been found. As is known, Y(III) has one occupied 4d orbital, which easily produces several electron configurations.27 Besides, Y has the smallest ionic radius among REEs,28 which is relatively close to the Ti4+ radius, thus, the substitution of Ti by Y seems feasible. Hence, in the present work, Y was adopted as the dopant, and the irregular mesoporous structure of the nano-powders was achieved via a facile way. The effect of an irregular mesoporous structure by Y doping TiO2 was reflected in the enhanced performance of DSSCs, which may open the way for further photoanode material research in the field of DSSCs.
2. Experimental
2.1. Preparation of Y-doped TiO2 powders
Y-doped TiO2 nanoparticles (NPs) were synthesized by modifying the reported method for blank TiO2 NPs.29 A stock solution of Ti4+ (0.5 M) was prepared by mixing titanium isopropoxide (TTIP) and triethanolamine (TEOA) (1 M), followed by addition distilled water. A small amount of yttrium nitrate (Y(NO3)3·6H2O) was initially added into the above mixture (Y3+/Ti4+ molar ratio = 0.6 at%, 1.8 at%, 3.0 at%, 4.2 at% and 5.4 at%, and TTIP:TEOA molar ratio = 1:2). The mixture was transferred into a Teflon-lined autoclave, aged at 100 °C for 24 h to carry out gelation (the first aging). Then the second aging treatment was performed at 140 °C for 72 h for the nucleation and growth of TiO2 particles doped with Y ions. The obtained Y-doped TiO2 powders were assigned as X%Y-TiO2, where X represents the initial molar ratio of Y/Ti as determined by the weighed quantities of TTIP and yttrium nitrate. The molar ratio in the NPs can deviate from this initial ratio. For comparison, pure TiO2 was prepared using the same procedure without Y3+. TTIP hydrolysates were identified as amorphous TiO2 using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) in combination with selected area electron diffraction (SAED), as shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). The SAED pattern indicated that TiO2 was in the amorphous state before further heat treatment.
2.2. Photoanode preparation
The pastes (Y-doped or not), prepared from the above powders, were deposited on the surface of fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) conductive glass using the doctor blade technique (FTO, sheet resistance: 15 Ω). The film thickness could easily be tailored by tuning the viscosity of the paste and the deposition time. The deposited films were dried at 130 °C and subsequently annealed at 500 °C for 1 h in air to remove residual organic compounds as well as to improve the bonding between the TiO2 film and the FTO substrate. The annealed samples were immersed into a solution containing 40 mM TiCl4 for 30 min at 70 °C, rinsed using deionized water, and then sintered at 500 °C. Finally, the film was dipped into an acetonitrile and ethanol (volume ratio = 2:1) solution containing 0.5 mM cis-bis (isothiocyanato)-bis (2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylato)-ruthenium(II)-bis-tetrabutyl-ammonium (N719) dye, and kept at room temperature for 24 h.
2.3. Y-doped TiO2 nanoparticle characterization and photovoltaic performance
The morphology of the obtained samples was studied using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (HitachiH-700). The crystal structure of the specimen was identified using X-ray diffraction (XRD) using a Bruker D8 advance diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation. The N2 adsorption–desorption tests were measured using micromeritics ASAP 2020 at 77 K with N2 physical adsorption, temperature-programmed reduction/desorption (TPR/TPD) and Mossbauer effect spectroscopy (MES) methods. The specific surface area (SSA) was calculated based on the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method. Desorption pore volume (for pores of diameter 1.7–300 nm) and pore width were measured using the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed on a Thermo Scientific X-ray photoelectron spectroscope made in UK (ESCALAB 250Xi). The XPS binding energy (BE) was internally referenced to the C 1s peak (w = 285 eV). The adsorbed dye of the photoanode was desorbed in a mixed solution of water and ethanol (volume ratio = 1:1) containing 0.1 M NaOH, and then measured using a UV-Vis spectrometer (SHIMADZU, UV-2550). The current–voltage (I–V) measurements were performed using a Keithley 2400 power source under an irradiation of 1 Sun, the intensity of the incident light of which was air mass (AM) 1.5 G. This instrument was equipped with a 300 W solar simulator (Solar Light Co., INC.), which served as the light source. In order to gain a better understanding of the electrical properties, the electrochemical impedance spectrum (EIS) was recorded under light irradiation via an electrochemical workstation (Zahner, IM6ex).
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Investigation of pure and doped nanoparticles

Fig. 1 shows the XRD diffraction pattern of pure TiO2 and X%Y-TiO2. It is clear that, according to JCPDS 65-5714, the as-prepared pure TiO2 and X%Y-TiO2 nanoparticles (NPs) are in the anatase phase. However, the diffraction peak of the sample X%Y-TiO2 is obviously broader; besides, the peak intensities of the X%Y-TiO2 are weaker than those found for pure TiO2, which can possibly be attributed to the presence of foreign ions in the crystal lattice.30 As depicted in Fig. S2 (ESI†), small shifts in peaks are observed reflecting an expansion of the unit cell volume. The lattice parameters and the unit cell volumes of pure TiO2 and X%Y-TiO2 are calculated from the equation for tetragonal system: (1)where dhkl is the interplanar spacing, which is determined from the anatase diffraction peaks of 101 and 200 for pure TiO2 and X%Y-TiO2. As shown in Table 1, a universal trend of the elongation of each axis and increase of unit cell volume are observed with the increase of the Y concentration. When the initial Y molar ratio is 3%, the lattice volume expands from 137.35 Å3 (non-doped NPs) to 138.30 Å3. The expansion of the TiO2 lattice may be attributed to the difference in the ionic radii of Y3+ (0.089 nm) and Ti4+ (0.068 nm), which indicates that the Y ions are incorporated into the TiO2 lattice. Besides, the crystallite size (D) is determined from the Debye–Scherrer equation: (2)where λ is the CuKα X-ray wavelength (1.5406 Å), k is a constant (in this study k = 0.943), β is the full-width at half maximum (FWHM) and θ is the diffraction angle. The general observation from the data shown in Table 1 is that a smaller crystallite size is obtained for all Y-doped samples. Obviously, 3%Y-TiO2 NPs exhibit the smallest average size of 25.11 nm (that of non-doped NPs is 28.41 nm). Upon further increasing the Y doping concentration, the Y-doped samples show a tendency for forming larger particle sizes again. M. Khan et al.14 fabricated Y doped anatase using the hydrothermal method which exhibited a reduced particle size and larger BET specific surface area compared to bare TiO2. L. Cheng et al.31 synthesized Y doped SnO2 using the electro-spinning method and suggested that Y doping distorts the crystal lattice and subsequently prevents the growth of crystallites. Since smaller particles usually manifest larger specific surface area (SSA); this is in good accordance with the relationship between our particle size and SSA results as indicated in Table 1.

The X-ray photoelectron spectrum (XPS) is used to further investigate the chemical state of the elements and explore how the doped yttrium cations interact with TiO2. The results are summarized in Fig. 2. Fig. 2a depicts the full scan XPS spectra of binding energy (BE). In Fig. 2b, the peak position of the O 1s core levels of 3%Y-TiO2 shifts to higher energy compared with those of undoped TiO2, indicating that the chemical environment of the elements has been changed.32,33 Further, the O 1s spectrum shows that two different oxygen binding energies exist in the as-prepared Y doping TiO2, as compared with the binding energy of oxygen in pure TiO2. The O 1s peak of 3%Y-TiO2 is divided into two different peaks which are located at 529.49 and 530.32 eV. These can be attributed to Ti–O and Y–O binding energies, respectively, as compared to that of pure TiO2 shown in Fig. 2b and Y–O binding energy in the literature (529.5 eV).33 The spectrum for the Y 3d region of 3%Y-TiO2 is shown in Fig. 2c. The BE of Y 3d5/2 and Y 3d3/2 for 3%Y-TiO2 is about 157.58 and 159.63 eV, respectively, with a spin–orbit splitting of 2.05 eV. These results are evidence that the oxidation state of the Y ions is mainly trivalent.34 Since oxidized yttrium was not observed in the XRD diagrams of X%Y-TiO2 although the concentration of Y is more than 3 at% (as shown in Fig. 1), it is certain that some Y ions have successfully substituted Ti ions in the TiO2 lattice during the solvothermal process, and some Ti–O bonds in pure TiO2 shown in Fig. 2b have been replaced by Y–O bonds. However, the XPS analysis result indicates that the actual Y amount in 3%Y-TiO2 is 1.21 at%.

A TEM study was conducted to examine the effect of Y doping on the morphology of anatase, as shown in Fig. 3. The average particle size of the NPs is 10–40 nm, which is in agreement with the average value of the crystallite size determined using XRD (as shown in Table 1). As shown in Fig. 3b and e, in contrast to the regular structure of pure TiO2 NPs, 3%Y-TiO2 NPs possess a more irregular mesoporous structure. The accumulated 3%Y-TiO2 NPs with irregular structures (see Fig. 3e) have an enhanced surface area and linked framework that will facilitate the diffusion of photo-induced electrons. Selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns shown in insets of Fig. 3a and d clearly indicate the poly-crystallinity circles in anatase of TiO2 and 3%Y-TiO2. Fig. 3c and f show that the (101) planes have slightly expanded in 3%Y-TiO2 (3.46 Å) compared to those in pure TiO2 (3.45 Å). This agrees favorably with the 101 interplanar spacing calculated from the 101 diffraction angle of TiO2 and 3%Y-TiO2 (see Table S2, ESI†), indicating that Y ions have also been doped into the TiO2 lattice. Finally, by comparing the microstructure of pure TiO2 (Fig. 3g) with that of 3%Y-TiO2 (Fig. 3h), lattice distortion can be detected, indicating oxygen vacancy and substitution of Y for Ti in 3%Y-TiO2 lattice. In other words, the XRD, XPS and TEM analysis results indicate that Y ions have entered into the TiO2 lattice and substituted Ti sites.

The N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms and pore size distributions of pure and doped nanoparticles are recorded and depicted in Fig. 4. It is shown in Fig. 4a that the isotherms of TiO2 and X%Y-TiO2 are identified as type V, a typical characteristic of mesoporous materials according to the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) classification system. The pore size distribution (Fig. 4b) of 3%Y-TiO2 ranges from 5 to 48 nm, which is broader than that of TiO2 (5 to 35 nm). The hysteresis loop appears to be type H2, indicating that the pores are formed by accumulated NPs due to the high surface activity of the as-prepared NPs. Effects of Y doping on the BET surface area and pore parameters are summarized in Table 1. The mesoporous NPs with 3 at% dopant show a high specific surface area and a pore volume of 142 m2 g−1 and 0.564 cm3 g−1, respectively, being 36.6% and 121.5% higher than that of pure TiO2 NPs. An increase of SSA and pore volume in the sequence 3%Y-TiO2–1.8%Y-TiO2–0.6%Y-TiO2–TiO2 is observed, while a large decrease in 4.2%Y-TiO2 and 5.4%Y-TiO2 occurs. However, all NPs with Y doping have higher SSA and pore volume compared with the reference sample. The smaller size (see Table 1) and irregular structure (see Fig. 3e) in doped NPs may account for the increase of SSA and pore volume for block X%Y-TiO2. TiO2 powders with higher SSA and larger pore volumes can enhance the efficiency of DSSC because more surface sites are available to adsorb organic dye, resulting in the enhancement of light harvesting capability and increasing the amount of excited electrons, which move through the interconnected porous network.

3.2. Photovoltaic performance
The characteristic current–voltage (I–V) curves for pure and Y-doped TiO2 and the effect of Y/Ti molar ratios on the relationship between specific surface area and conversion efficiency are depicted in Fig. 5. The detailed photovoltaic parameters, including energy conversion efficiency, open-circuit voltage (VOC), fill factors (FFs) and short circuit photocurrent densities (JSC) are summarized in Table 2. The dye adsorption has been measured and is also listed in Table 2: the amount of dye increased as the SSA increased. The SSA substantially enhances the dye adsorption from 0.79 × 10−7 (pure) to 1.26 × 10−7 mol cm−2 (3%Y-TiO2). Clearly, compared with the pure TiO2 based DSSC, a general increase of JSC has been observed for the X%Y-TiO2 based DSSC. In addition, we also measured the incident photo-current efficiency (IPCE) spectra of the pure and X%Y-TiO2 based DSSCs as shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†). The IPCE results are consistent with the photocurrent of the DSSCs. As shown in Fig. 5b, the irregular structure and small particle size due to the Y incorporation into the TiO2 matrix could provide high SSA and thus increase the amount of excited electrons because of larger dye adsorption, leading to the enhancement of JSC. The highest JSC value (15.74 mA cm−2) has been achieved by 3%Y-TiO2 based DSSC. Further increasing the Y/Ti molar ratios to over 4.2% leads to JSC reduction, which can be attributed to a larger internal resistance.26 Furthermore, a red shift of the absorption edge is observed in the UV-Vis absorption spectra of TiO2 and Y-doped TiO2 (Fig. S3, ESI†). The absorption threshold shifts from 395 nm (undoped) to 405 nm (3%Y-TiO2); so, the optical band gap decreases from 3.14 eV to 3.06 eV (see Table 1). The probable reason is that Y doping induces a part of the Y 4d states to extend into the TiO2 conduction band resulting in the narrowing of the band gap of anatase.14,35 This may promote the transport of electrons. As listed in Table 2, Y doping also results in a slight increase of VOC, which may be due to a small upward shift of the Fermi level upon Y doping,35 since the voltage produced under illumination corresponds to the difference between the electrons in the Fermi level of TiO2 NPs and the chemical potential of the holes in the hole conductor (electrolyte).36 It should be noted that Y doped TiO2 DSSC devices have higher fill factor (FF) values. The FF reflects the quality of the TiO2 film and the external electrical and electrochemical losses during the operation of the DSSCs.37,38 The N2 adsorption–desorption measurements, BET, dye amount, and I–V characteristic curves jointly demonstrate that the doping of Y plays an important role in the SSA, dye adsorption and the efficiency of DSSCs (see Table 2).

To study the difference between the interfacial characteristics of the photo-electrodes, the electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) of DSSCs based on pure TiO2 and X%Y-TiO2 have been measured in a frequency range from 0.01 Hz to 3 MHz under simulated solar light with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2 (AM 1.5). The results are shown in Fig. 6. According to Quintana et al.,39 the hemisphere in the intermediate-frequency region represents the transport resistance (Rct) associated with the charge transfer across the TiO2 film and the TiO2/redox electrolyte interface. Experimental data have been fitted to the model as depicted in Fig. 6c represented by the equivalent circuit. The EIS parameters of the TiO2 and X%Y-TiO2 based DSSCs are listed in Table 2. A decrease of Rct in the sequence TiO2–0.6%Y-TiO2–1.8%Y-TiO2–3%Y-TiO2 is observed, while an increase occurs when the initial Y molar ratio is over 4.2%, which is consistent with the JSC and the energy conversion efficiency of the obtained solar cells. S. Phadke et al.40 explained the EIS of DSSCs in terms of electron transport energetics/kinetics of the photoelectrochemical processes and the pore-channel openness and interconnection of the photoanode. They proved that the incorporation of a hierarchical, interconnected network of pores in the TiO2 electrode improves the charge transport. As shown in Table 2, the larger transport resistance of TiO2 based DSSC as compared to that of X%Y-TiO2 based DSSC can be due to the linked and irregular mesoporous structure of the latter: this enhances the diffusion of photo-induced electrons (see Fig. 3). In addition, the electron lifetime (τe) can be calculated from the Bode plots (Fig. 6b), using the following equation: (3)where ωmax is the frequency at which the intermediate-frequency peak appears in the Bode plot. Table 2 summarizes ωmax, τe and Rct of TiO2 and X%Y-TiO2. The τe value first increases to 20.47 ms and then decreases. Among these cells, the 3%Y-TiO2 cells have the highest τe value (20.47 ms) and lowest Rct value (19.38 Ω), resulting in the highest efficiency of energy conversion. It can be deduced from the EIS results that Y doping prolongs the lifetime of the injected electron and reduces the charge transport resistance significantly: hence, it improves the photovoltaic performance of the solar cell. From the results mentioned above, we conclude that a small particle size and irregular mesoporous structure caused by the Y incorporation into the TiO2 matrix is responsible for the high τe, the low Rct, the high VOC, the high JSC, the high FF and therefore the higher conversion efficiency of X%Y-TiO2 based DSSCs.

4. Conclusion
Mesoporous Y-doped TiO2 nanoparticles (NPs) have been successfully synthesized via a facile strategy. Y doping leads to a smaller particle size and expansion of the TiO2 lattice compared with the reference sample. Transmission electron microscopy indicates the linked and irregular mesoporous structure for the photo-induced electron diffusion of doping NPs. It is found that a Y doping concentration of 3 at% yields the best performance in terms of short circuit current density and efficiency. The parameters that correlate best with this performance increase are the specific surface area, the pore volume, the electron lifetime and the transport resistance. A DSSC with mesoporous 3%Y-TiO2 NPs, which have the highest specific surface area and pore volume (being 36.6% and 123% higher than that of pure TiO2), demonstrates ∼53% decrease of transport resistance and ∼216% increase of electron lifetime compared with the reference DSSC. Such doping effectively improves the photocurrent from 13.20 to 15.74 mA cm−2, photovoltage from 703 to 706 mV, yielding a high energy conversion of 7.61%. Finally, we hope that the present work is a good starting point for understanding the properties of mesoporous Y-doped NPs and DSSCs. We intend to study the electronic behavior related to the morphology of doped photoanode in DSSCs, both experimentally and theoretically.
