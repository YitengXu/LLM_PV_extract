, Accepted 30th September 2014First published on 30th September 2014AbstractWe propose a composite mono-Si solar cell integrated with CdO nanotips (NTs). The substrate was mono-Si with a Si3N4 antireflection (AR) layer already deposited on the top. CdO NTs were synthesized on the surface of the Si3N4 AR layer by chemical bath deposition (CBD). The CdO NTs composite solar cell achieved a 14% enhancement in power conversion efficiency (PCE) compared to the cell without CdO NTs. The J–V curve, reflectance, and photoluminescence demonstrate that the remarkable antireflection and down-conversion of CdO NTs, and the slightly increased fill factor played significant roles in the increased PCE. We believe that the PCE of Si solar cells still has scope for improvement by adding materials with proper antireflection, down-conversion and conductivity properties to the top of the cells.
1. Introduction
Although Si-based solar cells account for the majority of the photovoltaic market, optical, recombination, series resistance, and thermal or quantum losses are the four insurmountable barriers that constrain the theoretical efficiency of Si solar cell to 31%.1,2
Because the bare Si substrate is a poor absorber, different kinds of surface texturing processes have been explored and fabricated on a large scale to provide superior light scattering. In addition to pyramid texturing, one-dimensional (1-D) Si nanostructures have been extensively studied in recent years.3–5 However, the high recombination velocity restricts the improvement of the PCE regardless of the light trapping characteristics of the substrate.6,7 Absorption enhancement can also be achieved by using an antireflection (AR) layer. Through altering the difference in refractive index between air and crystalline Si, optical losses at the air–Si interface can be reduced.8 For instance, the deposition of a Si3N4 (n = 2) AR layer has been widely performed in commercial scale fabrication and reduces the reflectance of mono-Si solar cells from 35% to less than 10%.9,10 In recent years, other materials, such as SiO2 (n = 1.5), TiO2 (n = 2.5), and Al2O3 (n = 1.85), have also been reported as possessing remarkable AR properties. However, the ultraviolet (UV) region of the solar spectrum is not fully exploited in solar cells.11–13
According to Shockley–Queisser theory, thermal or quantum losses account for about half of the solar energy lost, partly because of the loss of photon energy that exceeds the Si band gap, especially in the UV region.1 Down-conversion materials could allow the whole solar spectrum to be used by emitting lower energy photons and extending the operational spectral range towards the ultraviolet.14 In the last few decades, rare earth-doped luminescent down-conversion materials have been widely investigated;15–17 however, the integration of these materials into Si-based solar cells is still far from practical. In addition, nano-materials with proper light trapping properties have also been applied to photovoltaic devices and have entered the spotlight.18,19 Nanocrystals, such as ZnS and ZnSe, have been introduced onto the bare Si substrate and have demonstrated promising photoelectric properties. However, the fill factors of the devices were decreased, which was mainly caused by decreased conduction.20,21 As reported in previous studies, cadmium oxide is a suitable material for solar cells because of its high electrical conductivity and optical transmittance in the visible region of the solar spectrum.22,23 The N-type conductivity, proper refractive index and down-conversion properties24,25 make CdO a promising candidate for improving the PCE of Si-based solar cells.
In the present study, we explore a strategy for improving the PCE of mono-Si solar cells by adding 1-D CdO nanotips (NTs) to the top of the cells. In contrast to previous studies, which mainly focused on bare Si substrates, a Si3N4 AR layer-capped mono-Si solar cell with a p–n active layer was employed as the reference device. 1-D CdO NTs were synthesized on the surface of Si3N4 to form a composite solar cell. The short-circuit current density (Jsc) of the CdO NTs composite solar cell was greatly enhanced and this contributed significantly to the 14% improvement in PCE. Based on the optical and spectral response characterization, we demonstrate that CdO NTs on the top of the device acts as an AR layer for light trapping incident photons and also has down-conversion properties that allow the device to make full use of the whole solar spectrum.
2. Experimental
The mono-Si solar cells employed in this work were purchased from Changzhou Yijing Optoelectronics Technology Co., Ltd., and contained a Si3N4 antireflection layer deposited by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD). The reference specimens were fabricated as follows. The front Ag electrode was printed and dried at 120 °C and went through rapid thermal annealing at 750 °C for 2 s. Chemical vapor deposition was employed to deposit Al as the back electrode. The reference specimens were washed with double distilled water and cut into 2 × 2 cm squares. CdO NTs were synthesized by chemical bath deposition using cadmium chloride (0.02 M) as the Cd2+ ion source. An excess of ammonium hydroxide (30%) solution was added to form a complex to obtain a clear solution. Two solar cells were stuck together with a waterproof seal to protect their backs from the alkaline solution. As a result, 1-D CdO NTs only grew on the Si3N4 surface. After 30–120 min, a white Cd(OH)2 film was formed on the tops of the specimens, and they were heat treated under oxygen in an air-tight container at 623 K for 120 min. The white film turned brown, confirming the formation of CdO.
The in situ synthesized CdO NTs were characterized by field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM; Hitachi, Japan, operated at 15 kV). X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on a D/MAX-2000 diffractometer (Rigaku, Japan), using Cu-Kα radiation at a scan rate (2θ) of 4° min−1. The electrical properties of the cells were characterized by obtaining their J–V characteristics under AM1.5 G (100 mW cm−2) illumination and with a Zennium electrochemical workstation (model: Xpot). The light intensity was calibrated with a silicon standard solar cell. The reflection spectra of the specimens were measured using a Cary 500 Scan UV/VIS/NIR spectrophotometer with an integrating sphere (Labsphere) in a wavelength range of 300–1200 nm. Photoluminescence spectroscopy was carried out with a Varian Cary-Eclipse 500 fluorescence spectrophotometer equipped with a 60 W Xenon lamp as the excitation source. The sample was excited with a light beam at 510 nm. EQE measurements were performed with a CrownTech CCTH-150W in a wavelength range of 300–1100 nm.
3. Results and discussion
The one-dimensional CdO NTs were grown in situ on the surface of the Si3N4 AR layer. The CBD growth involved 0-D nucleation and 1-D NTs growth. Initially, the Cd2+ provided by cadmium chloride and the OH− released from ammonium hydroxide rapidly formed the Cd(OH)2 particles. As the growth time increased, more adatoms were driven towards the nucleation points and formed 1-D Cd(OH)2 NTs. The film was converted into CdO by annealing at 623 K and H2O vapor was released during the heat treatment. The chemical reaction can be written as  
The surface morphologies are shown in Fig. 1(a) and (b) at two different magnifications. The 1-D nanostructure forms a composite with the pyramid textured surface, which will theoretically provide much stronger light scattering of the incident photons than the bare pyramid textured surface. The high-magnification cross-sectional image shows the CdO NTs deposited after 60 min are about 436 nm in length. The XRD pattern of CdO NTs is shown in Fig. 1(c). The peak at the 2θ values of 33.0°, 38.2°, 55.2° can be indexed to the (111), (200), (220) planes of CdO, indicating that a pure CdO phase was obtained and no other impurity peaks were detected (Fig. 2).

A semi-manufactured commercial mono c-Si solar cell was formed with p-type mono-Si on the bottom. In this device, 1-D CdO NTs were synthesized only on the surface of the Si3N4 AR layer. 
To obtain the optimum length for CdO NTs, we studied the effect of deposition time on the electric performance of the CdO NTs composite solar cells. Specimens with different deposition times were investigated under AM1.5G illumination. The photovoltaic performance indicated by Jsc and FF as a function of the deposition time are estimated and plotted in Fig. 3(a). With 1-D CdO NTs on the top, Jsc increased dramatically. The Jsc value of the reference solar cell is 32.81 mA cm−2. The Jsc values of 34.71, 36.76, 36.05 and 36.29 mA cm−2 correspond to deposition times of 30, 60, 90, and 120 min for CdO NTs, respectively. The mechanism of the enhancement will be discussed later. It is also worth noticing that the FF also increased to a certain extent with the deposition time, from 63.5% to 64.6%, 64.7%, 65.0% and 64.6%, respectively. A slight decrease in FF occurred in some previous studies,20,21 which was interpreted as the deterioration of the conduction of electrons in the N-type region toward the finger Ag electrode, resulting in a bigger series resistance. In our study, on one hand, the CdO NTs were grown on top of both the AR layer and the finger Ag electrode, it did not hamper the conduction of electrons from the N-type Si to the Ag electrode, and thus no extra series resistance was produced. On the other hand, the high conductivity of CdO means it functions as a transparent conductive oxide, which will probably provide better electron conduction and contribute to the slightly increased FF.22

The PCE of the four integrated solar cells increased with the deposition time from 12.1% to 13.0%, 13.8%, 13.4% and 13.7%, respectively. The deposition time of 60 min that produced a PCE of 13.8% should produce the best composite solar cell and the optimum CdO NTs length is around 440 nm. Fig. 3(b) shows the J–V characteristics of the reference mono-Si solar cell and the best measured CdO NTs composite solar cell. Because the additional layer of CdO NTs does not, in principle, change the Fermi energy distribution in the Si p–n junction, it will not generate any extra built-in electric field. As the result, the open-circuit voltage (Voc) remained unchanged, which is shown in the two curves. Because of the enhanced Jsc and Voc, the PCE of the CdO NTs composite solar cell achieved an increase of 14% compared to the control without CdO NTs. Compared with standard commercial mono-Si solar cells, which must reach an average efficiency of around 16% for industrial fabrication, the PCE value in this study is much lower. This is probably because of the extra series resistance resulting from the interface of the solder and wires during the J–V measurements. Because all the specimens were fabricated and measured under the same conditions, this deviation can be neglected.
In order to understand the underlying mechanism for the enhanced PCE, we initially investigated the antireflection properties of the CdO NTs. The reflectance spectra of the reference Si solar cell and the cell containing CdO NTs are shown in Fig. 4(a). It is worth noting that the reduction in reflectance from 300 to 450 nm is greatly improved. This is significant for the PCE enhancement. Rather than just targeting the CdO NTs absorption edge, the CdO NTs reduced the reflectance spectrum ranging from 300 to 1000 nm. The reduction of reflectance is probably caused by two factors. First, it is due to the additional light scattering provided from the one-dimensional structure. Second, the refractive index of 1-D CdO NTs was measured as 1.85–1.91 by a spectroscopic ellipsometer, just between air and Si3N4 (n = 2.0). The CdO NTs layer provided a gradual, continuous change in the effective refractive index from air to mono-Si (n = 3.42) and acted as a graded index layer above the hierarchical structure. The Fresnel reflection over a broad spectral width can be effectively eliminated.26 Consequently, CdO NTs provide an extra antireflection effect over the Si3N4 AR layer.

During annealing for 2 h at 350 °C under oxygen in an air-tight container, which generally decreases the number of inhomogeneities and dislocations, the as-deposited amorphous Cd(OH)2 thin film was converted into crystalline CdO NTs. The indirect band gap was calculated to be 2.43 eV, which is consistent with previous studies.27 The absorption and photoluminescence (PL) spectra in Fig. 4(b) show the down-conversion character of the CdO NTs layer. The absorption peak of CdO NTs is observed at 512 nm, as shown in Fig. 4(b). The fluorescence spectrum shows a peak at 695 nm with a 173 nm Stokes shift. In principle, the photon energy higher than the Si band gap cools quickly toward the band edges through the sequential emission of phonons. Little of the UV region is used in Si solar cells, since one photon only excites a single electron–hole pair in bulk c-Si. As the absorption depth is given by the inverse of the absorption coefficient, high-energy photons have a larger absorption coefficient and tend to be absorbed in the shallower region.9 UV light tends to produce electron–hole pairs near the surface of the device where the majority of surface defects are concentrated. The generated carriers disappear easily through recombination. However, with the CdO NTs down-conversion layer, the emitted lower energy photons were absorbed in the deeper region, allowing more photons to be absorbed in the depletion region. Photogenerated electron–hole pairs are separated immediately with the built-in electric field, and thus contribute to the Jsc enhancement.
The spectral response of the external quantum efficiency (EQE) was measured to understand the down-conversional property of CdO NTs in more detail. As shown in Fig. 5(a), the composite solar cell shows an enhanced EQE spectral response over the whole range, from 300 to 1100 nm. According to Fig. 5(b), the EQE enhancement curve peaks at 510 nm, which is consistent with the absorption peak of CdO NTs and implies that down-conversion occurred in the device. To characterize the contribution of the down-conversion effect, we calculated the effective current from the CdO NTs down-conversion layer on top of the reference solar cell. The carriers can be observed directly from the Jsc of a solar cell.28,29 The Jsc with and without CdO NTs are calculated as

IAM1.5G(λ) is the intensity of the AM1.5G solar spectrum. QY is the quantum yield of the NTs, where the average QY is about 55%. Eqn (1) and (2) show that the down-conversion photons are responsible for 13% of the Jsc enhancement.

To characterize possible candidate materials further, we also examined the integration of ZnO NTs. The high transmissivity and wide band gap of 1-D ZnO NTs mean it is also a promising material to be added to our reference solar cell. However, the performance of the resulting device was not as remarkable as that for the CdO NTs device. This is probably because the refractive index of ZnO is quite close to or bigger than Si3N4, thus is did not create a gradual refractive index change from air to c-Si and did not provide an extra antireflection effect. However, the CdO NTs device results showed that the more suitable refractive index provided better antireflection properties. Compared with the 14% PCE enhancement on a lab scale, achieving the same enhancement on a commercial scale is difficult. First, the quality of 1-D CdO NTs growth and the protection of the back of the substrate will be relatively inferior. Second, encapsulation materials are applied to the surface of the solar cell to provide protection. EVA, which is commonly used, also has a refractive index between air and Si3N4, and the gradient change of the refractive index from air to Si will be changed. This might decrease the improvement in the reflectance. However, because of the 1-D light trapping structure and remarkable down-conversion property, we believe that the advantages of CdO NTs outweigh the drawbacks and the CdO NTs composite structure could be used for enhancing the PCE of Si solar cells in large-scale fabrication.
4. Conclusion
In summary, a 4 cm2 mono-Si solar cell with a top layer of 1-D CdO NTs achieved 14% PCE enhancement. The three main mechanisms of the improvement were as follows. (1) The extra antireflection effect of CdO NTs compared with the Si3N4 AR layer. (2) The photon down-conversion of CdO NTs in the short wavelength region. (3) The slight improvement of the FF. We believe that the integration of 1-D nanomaterials with a suitable refractive index, down-conversion and conductivity is a promising new method for improving the PCE of Si-based solar cells.
