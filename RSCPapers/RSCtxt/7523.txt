    , Accepted 10th June 2015First published on 11th June 2015AbstractIn this paper, we report two conjugated molecules 1 and 2 with four diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) moieties, which are linked by [2,2]paracyclophane. The energies of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of 1 and 2 were estimated from the respective onset oxidation and reduction potentials, which were determined on the basis of cyclic voltammetric data. Both 1 and 2 exhibit strong absorption in the visible region. Blended thin films of 1 and 2 with P3HT (poly(3-hexylthiophene)) in different weight ratios were utilized as active layers to fabricate solar cells. The results reveal that blended thin films of P3HT/1 and P3HT/2 at a weight ratio of 2:1 yielded the best photovoltaic performance with power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) up to 1.33% and 1.84% after thermal annealing. Blended thin films of P3HT/1 and P3HT/2 were characterized by XRD (X-ray diffraction) and AFM (atomic force microscopy) techniques. The low degree of inter-chain packing order and poor thin-film morphology are responsible for the relatively low PCEs.
Introduction
The performance of organic photovoltaic cells (OPVs) is dependent on the features of electron donors and acceptors. Various small-molecule and polymeric electron donors and acceptors have been explored for high-performance photovoltaic materials.1–5 Fullerene derivatives, including PC61BM and PC71BM, are widely utilized as electron acceptors for OPVs because they exhibit high electron affinity, high electron mobility and isotropic charge transport.6 However, the HOMO/LUMO energies of fullerene molecules are not easily tuned by chemical modifications to match the electron donors to maximize the open-circuit voltage (VOC) and minimize energy loss. Importantly, fullerenes usually display weak absorption in the visible region.7 Accordingly, non-fullerene acceptors with strong absorption in the visible region and appropriate HOMO/LUMO levels have been investigated in recent years.8–13 These efforts have yielded promising non-fullerene acceptors, which are expected to pair with electron donors according to their energy levels and absorptions to form OPVs with high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs). Nevertheless, only a limited number of non-fullerene small-molecule acceptors have been successfully used to fabricate OPVs with PCEs higher than 1.5% and even fewer with PCEs higher than 2.5%.9–12 A few perylene diimide derivatives led to OPVs with PCEs higher than 5.0%.13
It is known that DPP (diketopyrrolopyrrole) displays strong absorptions in the visible region and its HOMO/LUMO energies can be tuned by connection with electron-donating or accepting moieties. In fact, a number of DPP-containing small conjugated molecules and polymers have been investigated as electron donors for OPVs.14–17 Some of us have very recently described a new conjugated molecular scaffold based on [2,2]paracyclophane with four DPP moieties; the new conjugated molecules can function as electron acceptors for organic photovoltaic cells.18 In this paper, we describe two conjugated molecules 1 and 2 (Scheme 1), in which four DPP moieties are linked at different positions of [2,2]paracyclophane. The selection of the [2,2]paracyclophane framework is due to its cylindrical and rigid structure, which is expected to be beneficial for intermolecular packing and thus charge transport. The presence of four DPP moieties is anticipated to be favourable for the formation of more donor–acceptor interfaces. The addition of electron-withdrawing 3,4,5-trifluorophenyl moieties in 2 is intended to tune the HOMO/LUMO levels. The results reveal that both 1 and 2 can function as electron acceptors for organic photovoltaic cells.

Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization
The synthesis of 1 and 2 is outlined in Scheme 1. Compounds 419 and 518 were synthesized according to the reported procedure. Then, Sonogashira coupling of 4,5,13,14-tetraethynyl[2,2]paracyclophane (3) with 4 and 5 separately yielded 1 and 2 in acceptable yields (see Experimental section). The chemical structures and purities of 1 and 2 were established and confirmed by spectroscopic data and elemental analysis (see Experimental section). Both 1 and 2 exhibit good solubility in common organic solvents, such as chloroform, tetrahydrofuran, toluene and o-DCB (1,2-dichlorobenzene), at room temperature. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) reveals that 1 and 2 are thermally stable below 300 °C (see Fig. S1, ESI†).
HOMO/LUMO energies and bandgaps
As shown in Fig. 1a, both 1 and 2 exhibit two reversible oxidation waves and one reduction wave. Based on the respective onset oxidation and reduction potentials, the energies of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of 1 and 2 were estimated using the following equations and are listed in Table 1: HOMO = −(Eox1onset + 4.8) eV and LUMO = −(Ered1onset + 4.8) eV. The HOMO/LUMO energies of 1 and 2 were estimated to be −3.41 eV/−5.27 eV and −3.43 eV/−5.30 eV, respectively (see Table 1). Accordingly, the bandgaps of 1 and 2 were calculated to be 1.86 eV and 1.87 eV, respectively. Obviously, both the HOMO and LUMO levels of 2 are lower than those of 1. This is due to the electron-withdrawing effect of the 3,4,5-trifluorophenyl groups in 2. The HOMO/LUMO energies of 1 and 2 were compared with those of P3HT, as shown in Fig. 1b. Judging from the energy levels, both 1 and 2 are suitable electron acceptors for OPVs in combination with P3HT (poly(3-hexylthiophene)) as the electron donor. In particular, the energy differences between the HOMO level of P3HT and those of 1 and 2 are higher than 1.2 eV, which may result in a relatively high open-circuit voltage (VOC).

As expected, both 1 and 2 show strong absorptions in the visible region, as shown in Fig. 2. For instance, the solution of 1 exhibits absorptions in the range of 450–650 nm and strong absorption around 550 nm with εmax = 213000 M−1 cm−1. The absorption maxima of 1 and 2 are listed in Table 1. Compared to those in solutions, the absorption spectra of thin films of 1 and 2 are red-shifted. The absorption bands at 550 nm and 585 nm in solution are shifted to 567 nm and 611 nm for the thin film of 1. The thin film of 2 absorbs strongly around 600 nm and 650 nm, which are red-shifted in comparison with the maxima in solution. Such spectral shifts in absorption are probably induced by intermolecular pi–pi interactions within thin films. The absorption spectra of 2 in both solution and thin film are red-shifted in comparison with those of 1. This can be interpreted by considering the presence of 3,4,5-trifluorophenyl groups in 2, which may increase the conjugation length. In addition, the optical band gaps of 1 and 2 were estimated to be 1.85 eV and 1.74 eV on the basis of the respective onset absorptions of thin films of 1 and 2. These values are in good agreement with those obtained based by cyclic voltammetry (see Table 1).

Photovoltaic device performance
To demonstrate potential applications of 1 and 2 as electron acceptors for OPVs, blended thin films of 1 and 2 with P3HT were utilized to fabricate OPVs with the conventional configuration of indium tin oxide (ITO)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)/active layer/Ca/Al. The respective photovoltaic performance data based on the J–V curves, shown in Fig. 3, are summarized in Table 2. The pairing of 1 with P3HT yielded OPVs with VOC of 1.03–1.06 V, because of the large difference in energy levels between the HOMO of P3HT and LUMO of 1. Both 1 and 2 were blended with P3HT separately in different weight ratios and tested as active layers for OPVs (see Fig. 3a and b). Table 2 lists the respective photovoltaic performance data. The blend of P3HT/1 at a weight ratio of 2:1 gave the best performance: VOC = 1.03 V, JSC = 2.36 mA cm−2, FF = 0.41 and PCE = 0.99%. Thermal annealing of the blended thin films at 110 °C for 10 min increased JSC to 2.93 mA cm−2 and FF was also slightly increased (see Table 2), leading to PCE of 1.33%. Similarly, the blended thin film of P3HT and 2 at a weight ratio of 2:1 also gave the best performance: VOC, JSC, FF and PCE reached 0.93 V, 3.27 mA cm−2, 0.47 and 1.45%, respectively. The PCE increased to 1.84% after thermal annealing of the photoactive thin film at 110 °C for 10 min. The introduction of additives could not significantly improve the photovoltaic performance for the blended thin films of 1 and 2 with P3HT under current device configuration. For comparison, OPVs with thin films of P3HT/PC61BM were also fabricated under the same conditions. After optimization, P3HT/PC61BM blended thin film at a weight ratio of 1:1 provided a PCE of 3.98%. Thus, it can be inferred that an OPV with 2 as a non-fullerene acceptor can achieve a PCE that is 46% of the value with P3HT/PC61BM as the active layer. According to our previous report,18 the PCE of OPVs with a blended film of P3HT with 6 (Scheme 1) at a weight ratio of 1:1 is just 0.90%. Compound 6 contains no [2,2]paracyclophane framework. Thus, it may be concluded that the incorporation of a [2,2]paracyclophane framework in 1 and 2 is beneficial for better photovoltaic performance after blending with P3HT.

Fig. S2 (ESI†) shows the IPCE (incident photon to converted current efficiency) spectra of blended thin films of P3HT/1 and P3HT/2 at different weight ratios before and after thermal annealing. The profiles of the IPCE spectra correspond well to the respective absorption spectra of thin films of 1 and 2, which implies that 1 and 2 within the blended thin films make a considerable contribution to IPCE. The blended thin films of 1 and 2 with P3HT at a weight ratio of 2:1 yielded higher IPCE. Moreover, IPCE was increased after thermal annealing of the blended thin films. The maximum IPCEs of 14% (at 562 nm) and 27% (at 558 nm) were observed for the blended thin films P3HT/1 and P3HT/2, respectively. This may partly explain the observation that the thin film of P3HT/2 provides a higher PCE than that of P3HT/1.
The charge mobilities of the blended thin films of P3HT/1 and P3HT/2 were measured by the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method.20 For hole-only and electron-only devices, the structures ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:1 (or 2) (2:1, w/w)/Au and Mg/P3HT:1 (or 2) (2:1, w/w)/Mg were used, respectively. The large energy barriers (1.69 eV and 1.67 eV for 1 and 2) between the Au work function (5.1 eV) and the LUMO levels (−3.41 eV and −3.43 eV, respectively) of 1 and 2 would suppress electron injection from the top electrode, and thus render the devices hole-only characteristics. Similarly, the large energy barriers (1.61 eV and 1.64 eV for 1 and 2) between the Mg work function (3.66 eV) and the HOMO levels (−5.27 eV and −5.30 eV, respectively) of 1 and 2 would suppress hole injection; in comparison, the respective electron injection barriers are considerably small (0.25 eV and 0.23 eV for 1 and 2), and thus render the devices electron-only characteristics.
Table S1 (ESI†) lists the hole and electron mobilities of the blended thin films of P3HT/1 and P3HT/2 at a weight ratio of 2:1 before and after thermal annealing at 110 °C for 10 min. Hole mobilities are considerably higher than the respective electron mobilities for both P3HT/1 and P3HT/2 thin films; thus, hole and electron transport are not balanced within these thin films. This may be responsible for the low PCEs of these blended thin films. Both hole and electron mobilities increase after thermal annealing. For instance, for P3HT/2 thin film, μh increases from 1.87 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 to 3.48 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and μe increases from 4.48 × 10−7 cm2 V−1 s−1 to 1.30 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1. This agrees well with the observation that the photovoltaic performance of P3HT/1 and P3HT/2 improves after thermal annealing (see Table 2). Compared to P3HT/1 thin film, the blended thin film of P3HT/2 exhibits higher hole and electron mobilities, in particular after thermal annealing; moreover, the ratio of μh/μe for P3HT/2 is lower than that for P3HT/1 both before and after thermal annealing, as listed in Table S1 (ESI†). These results explain the fact that P3HT/2 thin film yields higher PCE than P3HT/1 thin film (see Table 2).
The blended thin films of P3HT/1 and P3HT/2 at a weight ratio of 2:1 were also investigated using XRD and AFM techniques. As shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†), a signal at 2θ = 5.40°, corresponding to the d-spacing of 16.3 Å, was detected for both blended thin films, and the intensity was slightly enhanced after thermal annealing. Furthermore, a weak diffraction peak at 2θ = 21.3°, corresponding to the d-spacing of 4.0 Å, was detected for both P3HT/1 and P3HT/2. These XRD signals are probably due to the formation of crystalline domains of P3HT within the blended thin films according to previous studies,21 in which a diffraction signal at 2θ = 5.40° was reported for P3HT/PC61BM thin film on PEDOT:PSS. It is noted that these diffractions are rather weak, and thus the degree of inter-chain packing order is low for both P3HT/1 and P3HT/2.
The surface morphologies of P3HT/1 and P3HT/2 blended thin films were also examined by AFM in tapping mode. Based on the AFM images shown in Fig. 4, the root-mean-square (rms) roughness of the P3HT/1 thin film decreased from 3.58 nm to 2.56 nm after thermal annealing. Similarly, the rms roughness of the P3HT/2 thin film decreased from 3.22 nm to 2.35 nm after thermal annealing. The bright and dark domains in the AFM phase images become more clearly separated after thermal annealing for both P3HT/1 and P3HT/2 thin films. Moreover, the sizes of bright domains vary from 50–80 nm to 25–50 nm for P3HT/1 thin film, whereas those of P3HT/2 thin film are reduced to about 50 nm after thermal annealing. These AFM images are consistent with the observation that thermal annealing led to the improvement of PCEs for both thin films, according to previous studies.8d However, the phase separation in both thin films is not clear and uniform even after thermal annealing. This may be the main reason why blended thin films of P3HT/1 and P3HT/2 display low photovoltaic performance.

Conclusions
Four diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) moieties were successfully substituted onto [2,2]paracyclophane, leading to new conjugated molecules 1 and 2. On the basis of cyclic voltammetric data, the energies of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of 2 were lower than those of 1 because of the electron-withdrawing 3,4,5-trifluorophenyl moieties in 2. Both 1 and 2 can function as electron acceptors for photovoltaic cells. Blended thin films of 1 and 2 with P3HT (poly(3-hexylthiophene)) were tested at different weight ratios as active layers for fabricating OPVs with the conventional device configuration. The results reveal that the blended thin films of P3HT/1 and P3HT/2 at a weight ratio of 2:1 provided the best photovoltaic performance with power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) up to 1.33% and 1.84% after thermal annealing. XRD (X-ray diffraction) and AFM (atomic force microscopy) characterizations of the blended thin films indicate that the degree of inter-chain packing order is low and the thin-film morphology of these blended thin films is poor, even after thermal annealing. These structural features of the blended thin films may explain the low charge mobilities and PCEs of P3HT/1 and P3HT/2 thin films. The optimization of thin-film morphology is underway to improve PCEs. The addition of strong electron-accepting moieties and variation of alkyl chains may offer new electron acceptors to pair with polymeric donors for organic photovoltaic cells (OPVs) with high performance.

Fabrication of organic photovoltaic cells
Solar cells were fabricated with a general structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS (30 nm)/active layer/Ca (20 nm)/Al (70 nm). Patterned indium tin oxide (ITO) glass substrates were pre-cleaned by sequential ultrasonic treatments in detergent, deionized water, acetone, and isopropanol, and treated in an ultraviolet-ozone chamber (Jelight Company, USA) for 20 min. A thin layer (30 nm) of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS, Baytron P VP AI 4083, Germany) was spin-coated onto ITO glass substrates and baked at 150 °C for 15 min. Solutions of P3HT/1 and P3HT/2 with different weight ratios were separately spin-coated on a PEDOT:PSS layer to form the respective photoactive layers (ca. 80–100 nm). The thickness of the photoactive layers was measured by an Ambios Technology XP-2 profilometer. Calcium (ca. 20 nm) and aluminum (ca. 70 nm) layers were then evaporated onto the surface of the active layer under vacuum (ca. 10−5 Pa) to form a negative electrode. The active area of the device was 4.0 mm2. J–V curves were measured with a computer-controlled Keithley 236 Source Measure Unit. A xenon lamp coupled with AM 1.5 solar spectrum filters was used as the light source and the optical power at the sample was 100 mW cm−2. The incident photon to converted current efficiency (IPCE) spectrum was obtained by a Stanford Research Systems model SR830 DSP lock-in amplifier coupled with a WDG3 monochromator and a 500 W xenon lamp.
