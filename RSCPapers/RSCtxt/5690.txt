    , Accepted 17th July 2018First published on 17th July 2018AbstractTiO2 is a celebrated photo-catalyst for methanol oxidation reaction (MOR). However, its modification is necessitated by a narrow light response region and swift recombination of electrons and holes. Incorporating carbon dots (CDs) with TiO2 can broaden the light response range, while a composite of TiO2 with Pt can significantly enhance the catalytic performance and also suppress the electron–hole recombination process. Herein, we report the structural, optical and electrochemical evaluation of a new photo-electrocatalyst – platinized TiO2 sensitized by CDs – through a series of systematic studies. Reasonably, by combining both photo-catalytic and electro-catalytic mechanisms, the ternary composite catalyst (Pt/CD/TiO2) under irradiation shows better performance in the MOR in terms of the forward peak current density value of 2.5 mA cm−2, which exceeds that obtained without illumination by 24%. The performance enhancement can be attributed to the unique upconversion properties of CDs that allow the utilization of the visible solar range, which is otherwise restricted in case only TiO2 is present.
1. Introduction
Noble metal nanoparticles like platinum (Pt) possess excellent catalytic properties, which make them highly desirable for a plethora of energy-related applications, including solar cells and fuel cells.1,2 The direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC), employing liquid methanol, is a clean power source that converts chemical energy directly into electricity. The whole process is pollutant-free and bypasses the issues of storage, transportation and handling which are usually associated with hydrogen-fed fuel cells.3 The development of the anode catalyst constitutes a major facet of this technology. Pt is regarded as the most significant electro-catalyst for the methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) in DMFCs.4–6 However, Pt nanoparticles have high surface energy which prompts them to aggregate. Additionally, a single component Pt electro-catalyst is acutely prone to carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning. MOR follows a dual pathway mechanism, and CO generated as an intermediate in the indirect pathway strongly adsorbs onto the Pt surface. Consequently, the reaction kinetics slow down considerably.7
Titanium dioxide (TiO2), on the other hand, is one of the most studied photo-catalysts.8 The photo-catalytic applications of this wide band gap semiconductor metal oxide are based on the formation of electron–hole pairs when it is irradiated with ultra-violet (UV) light. Combining TiO2 nanoparticles with Pt nanoparticles presents an effective strategy to develop a photo-electrocatalyst, wherein MOR is photo-catalyzed by the photo-induced holes on the TiO2 nanoparticles and electro-catalyzed by the Pt nanoparticles at the same time. Previous works show that such a scenario can lead to better catalytic activities of the composites.9–11 High surface area TiO2 nanoparticles not only act as a support for homogeneous dispersion of the Pt nanoparticles on its surface and reduce the Pt loading but also help in mitigating the CO poisoning effect.
TiO2 can be photo-excited only by the UV part of the solar light, which accounts for about 4% of the total solar light reaching the earth's surface. So, there is a huge scope for developing new innovative catalyst designs, which can extend the sunlight absorption stretch to the visible region.12 Some of the popular routes include doping TiO2 with different ions, coupling with small band gap semiconductors, sensitizing with organic dyes, and so on.13–17 Lately, carbon dots (CDs), a new class of carbon-based nanomaterials, have gained popularity because of their visible light absorption and unique upconversion photoluminescence (PL) properties.18,19 CDs, with an excellent charge transfer ability, have already been reported as sensitizers for TiO2 nanoparticles, and the visible light active catalysts thus produced have been used in photo-degradation, hydrogen gas evolution, and solar cells, etc.20–24 In addition, CDs also possess an exceptional ability to offer resistance to CO poisoning on the Pt surface, thereby enabling better performances of Pt based catalysts in MOR.25–27
Recently, Zheng et al. reported an interesting result where they observed that a CD sensitized Pt@Bi2WO6/FTO electrode showed better catalytic activity and stability in MOR in comparison with the non-sensitized electrode.28 The sensitization by CDs broadened the photo-response range of Bi2WO6 and also created a new type of CD–Pt catalyst. They further suggested that CO molecules are preferentially adsorbed on CDs, which leaves the Pt sites free. Hydroxyl radicals (˙OH) generated during the catalysis process can oxidize the CO molecules, a fact that has also been stated by Zhai et al.29 Following this vision, we report a novel photo-electrocatalyst: Pt supported on CD sensitized TiO2 nanoparticles (Pt/CD/TiO2). The nanocomposite performs the dual function of a photo-catalyst and an electro-catalyst under simulated solar light illumination. To the best of our knowledge, this system has not been previously reported for MOR. The presence of TiO2 and CDs leads to comprehensive exploitation of both the UV and visible regions of the solar spectrum, in addition to acting as anti-CO poisoning mediators.
2. Experimental
2.1 Materials
TiO2, citric acid monohydrate, ethylenediamine, terephthalic acid, chloroplatinic acid (8 wt% in water), sodium borohydride, potassium ferricyanide and potassium ferrocyanide were purchased from Merck. Methanol, ethanol, sodium hydroxide, sulfuric acid and potassium chloride were also procured from Merck. Distilled water was used for all purposes.
2.2 Synthesis of CDs
The synthesis process reported by Zhu et al. was used to produce CDs hydrothermally.30 In a typical procedure, 0.42 g citric acid monohydrate and 0.54 mL of ethylenediamine were dissolved in 10 mL distilled water. The reaction mixture was then transferred to a Teflon lined autoclave and heated at 150 °C for 5 h. The autoclave was allowed to cool down to room temperature. A transparent, brownish black liquid was obtained, which was subjected to centrifugation and filtration with a 0.22 μm membrane, and rotary evaporation to obtain powdered CDs.
2.3 Synthesis of CD sensitized TiO2 nanoparticles
A hydrothermal route was again employed for producing CD sensitized TiO2 nanoparticles (CD/TiO2) following the procedure reported by Yu et al.21 A series of nanocomposites with different weight percentages (wt%) of CDs were prepared to study the effect of the CD content on MOR. The nanocomposites were labelled CD0/TiO2, CD1/TiO2, CD2/TiO2 and CD3/TiO2 with CD contents of 0, 1, 2 and 3 wt%, respectively. In general, 0.4 g of TiO2 nanoparticles (∼21 nm size) were dispersed in 6 mL ethanol and a 2 mg mL−1 aqueous solution of CDs (according to the wt%) was added to it. 10 mL distilled water was further added to the reaction mixture and stirred for 4 hours at room temperature. It was then transferred to a Teflon lined autoclave and heated at 140 °C for 4 h. Once the autoclave had cooled down to room temperature, the reaction product was centrifuged and vacuum dried to obtain brownish-white CDx/TiO2 powders (x denotes the content of CD).
2.4 Synthesis of platinized CDx/TiO2 composites
For platinization of CDx/TiO2, a chemical reduction route was employed as mentioned by Pan et al. with slight modifications.27 In this process, 50 mg of CDx/TiO2 powder was dispersed in 10 mL distilled water. Then an aqueous solution of 20 mM H2PtCl6 (corresponding to y wt% Pt; y = 2.5, 3.0, 3.5 and 4.0) was added dropwise to the above dispersion with stirring. For instance, to prepare the 3.0 wt% platinized composite, Pt3/CD2/TiO2, 1.67 mL H2PtCl6 solution was added to the 5 mg mL−1 CD2/TiO2 dispersion. To this reaction mixture, 1 mL of an aqueous solution of 50 mM NaBH4 was added dropwise. Prior to that, the pH of the NaBH4 solution was adjusted to 12 by adding NaOH. The resulting solution was continuously stirred for 3 h at 55 °C. Finally, the solution was filtered, washed with de-ionized water and the solvent evaporated with a rotary evaporator to obtain Pt3/CD2/TiO2 powder. The whole synthesis procedure is summarized in Scheme 1. For the sake of convenience, only a single TiO2 particle is presented in the scheme and it is represented as a sphere.

2.5 Characterization and tests
Fourier transform infra-red (FTIR) spectra and powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the samples were obtained using a Nicolet Impact-410 IR spectrometer and a D8 Focus (Bruker AXS, Germany) instrument. A Shimadzu UV-2550 spectrophotometer and a Hitachi F-2700 fluorescence spectrophotometer were used to record the electronic absorption and fluorescence spectra of the materials incorporating CDs. The X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) of the samples were recorded on a Kratos Axis-Ultra spectrometer. Transmission electron microscope (TEM) images were captured on a JEM-100 CX II instrument. The dynamic light scattering (DLS) experiment was performed using a Microtrac Nanotrac Wave particle size analyzer. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) elemental mapping images were acquired using a Jeol JSM 6390LV instrument. All the electrochemical measurements were performed using a Bio-Logic SP-150 potentiostat. A three-electrode set-up consisting of the fabricated catalyst electrode as the working electrode, a Pt wire as the counter electrode and Ag/AgCl (saturated KCl) as the reference electrode was used for all the tests. To imitate sunlight, 1 sun illumination was generated by a solar simulator with a xenon arc lamp with an irradiation of 100 mW cm−2.

2.5.1 Fabrication of the working electrode. 
Fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) coated glass slides were used as substrates for all the photo-electrochemical measurements. A paste of 10 mg mL−1 Pty/CDx/TiO2 in ethanol was prepared ultrasonically. It was then coated onto 1 cm2 surface area of the glass slides via the doctor blade technique and sintered at 400 °C for 30 min. The resulting glass slides were used as the working electrodes.


2.5.2 Hydroxyl radical (˙OH) trapping tests. 
40 mg each of TiO2 and CD3/TiO2 were separately added into 100 mL aqueous suspensions of 10 mM NaOH and 3 mM terephthalic acid, and stirred in the dark for 30 min. The suspensions were then irradiated with simulated solar light. 5 mL of each suspension was taken out every 2 min, centrifuged and the supernatant was measured for PL intensity with excitation at 320 nm.

3. Results and discussion
3.1 Structural, morphological and optical analyses of the nanomaterials
The FTIR spectra of the hydrothermally synthesized CDs and CD/TiO2 nanocomposite are shown in Fig. 1. For the CDs, the broad peak (3000–3700 cm−1) is attributed to the vibration of the –OH bond while the one at 2943 cm−1 is associated with –CH vibration. The peaks at 1658, 1558 and 1422 cm−1 are ascribed to –CO, –CC, and –NH groups, respectively.30 Similar characteristic peaks are also seen in CD/TiO2, affirming the incorporation of CDs into the TiO2 matrix. Additionally, another broad peak appears in the region below 1000 cm−1. This region is typically allotted to the Ti–O–Ti vibrational peak whereas the peak for the Ti–O–C bond is generally observed at around 800 cm−1. Hence, the broad peak can be visualized as a combination of these two groups, implying the formation of a Ti–O–C chemical bond between the residual carboxylic groups of CDs and surface hydroxyl groups of TiO2.31

XPS was used to determine the elemental composition of the prepared Pt/CD/TiO2 nanocomposite. The typical high-resolution XPS spectra for C 1s, O 1s, Ti 2p and Pt 4f showing the peaks at their respective binding energies are displayed in Fig. 2. In the deconvoluted spectrum of C 1s, four well-resolved peaks are seen which can be ascribed to the following different C functional groups: C–C/CC (284.4 eV), C–N (285.7 eV), C–O (286.4 eV) and CO/CN (288.2 eV).32 The core-level O 1s spectrum reveals the existence of three individual peaks at 530.1, 531.1 and 532.4 eV corresponding to Ti–O, C–O and O–H bonds, respectively.21 The high resolution Ti 2p spectrum consists of two peaks: Ti (2p3/2) at 458.4 eV and Ti (2p1/2) at 464.2 eV. The XPS spectrum in the Pt 4f region divulges the existence of a doublet at 71.2 eV (Pt 4f7/2) and 74.7 eV (Pt 4f5/2), validating the presence of Pt in the (0) oxidation state. In addition, the spectrum also shows peaks having (+2) and (+4) oxidation states at 72.3 eV (Pt 4f7/2) and 75.7 eV (Pt 4f5/2), and 73.6 eV (Pt 4f7/2) and 77.6 eV (Pt 4f5/2), respectively. Pt(0) is considered to be the active site for methanol adsorption while Pt(+2) can promote the oxidation of COads to CO2.33

The XRD pattern of the Pt/CD/TiO2 nanocomposite shows the co-existence of anatase and rutile phases of TiO2, although it is mainly composed of the anatase phase (Fig. 3). Nine characteristic peaks of anatase TiO2 can be seen, including the most remarkable one at 2θ = 25.2° due to the (101) plane. Three distinctive peaks at 2θ values of 27.4°, 36.1° and 56.6° correspond to the (110), (101) and (220) planes of rutile TiO2. The XRD pattern of the hydrothermally produced CDs from citric acid emphasizes their amorphous nature (Fig. 3 inset). The primary diffraction peak is quite broad and centred at around 2θ = 22.3°, while another broad peak is seen at 2θ = 40.7°. These peaks correspond to the (002) and (100) planes of the graphitic framework, respectively.34 The broad nature of the peaks indicates the highly disordered structure of the CDs. In the XRD pattern of the nanocomposite, however, no diffraction peak pertaining to the CDs is visible. This can be attributed to the amount of CDs added being very small and its low crystallinity.35 Two additional low intensity peaks at 2θ = 40.0° and 46.0° are also seen in the XRD pattern, corresponding to the (111) and (200) planes of Pt, respectively.36 The incorporation of CDs and Pt nanoparticles show no noticeable influence on the crystallinity or the phase of TiO2.

Fig. 4(a) and (b) display the TEM images of the Pt/CD/TiO2 nanocomposite. With TiO2 as a support, CDs and Pt nanoparticles are seen randomly distributed over the surface without any aggregation. The typical size of the acquired TiO2 nano-powder is less than 21 nm, and it shows a good crystalline nature. Most of the particles exist in the anatase phase with a lattice spacing of 0.33 nm obtained from the high resolution TEM (HRTEM) micrograph of TiO2 (Fig. 4(c)). This lattice spacing represents the interlayer distance of the (101) crystal plane of TiO2.37 The CDs, on average, have a spherical morphology with a diameter of 6 nm (the particle size distribution of CDs as obtained by DLS is shown in Fig. S1†). The CD nanoparticles are predominantly amorphous in nature. Chemically reduced Pt nanoparticles, on the other hand, have a typical size of 3 nm. The HRTEM image reveals a 0.22 nm lattice spacing corresponding to the (111) Pt crystal plane (Fig. 4(d)).38

The EDX elemental mapping results for the Pt based nanocomposite are presented in Fig. 5 (with the corresponding SEM image in Fig. S2†). The analysis confirms the presence of Ti, C and Pt resulting from TiO2, CDs and Pt nanoparticles. A denser distribution of Ti than the other two elements signifies that C and Pt are uniformly distributed on the surface of TiO2.

Fig. 6(a) shows the UV-visible absorption spectra of CDs, TiO2 and CD/TiO2 nanocomposites in the range 210–700 nm. Two absorption bands peaking at 235 nm and 338 nm are the prominent features of the spectrum of CDs. In accordance with previous reports, the peak at 235 nm is observed due to π–π* transition of aromatic CC bonds while the one at 338 nm is attributed to n–π* transitions of CO.39,40 In the case of TiO2 nanoparticles, a monotonous increase in absorbance from the visible region to the UV region is seen, with the appearance of a broad peak corresponding to a 3.18 eV optical band gap (Eg), which matches with the anatase form of TiO2.41Fig. 6(b) shows the Tauc plots ((αhν)1/2vs. photon energy (hν)) of the nanomaterials,42 according to the following dependence (eqn (1)): αhν = (hν − Eg)1/n(1)where α and n represent the absorption coefficient and the power coefficient (=1/2) of indirect allowed electronic transitions, respectively. With the modification of TiO2 with CDs, the Eg value narrows to 3.08 eV, which can be attributed to the formation of a Ti–O–C bond. This suitably explains the extension of the solar light harnessing potential to the visible range for attaining more efficient activity of the CD/TiO2 nanocomposites.

To verify the fluorescence properties of the CDs, the nanoparticles were dispersed in distilled water and their PL spectra were recorded at different excitation wavelengths, as shown in Fig. 7. As expected, the CDs display excitation dependent fluorescence properties with a progressive red-shift when excited from 300 nm to 500 nm at an interval of 50 nm. Although a bit controversial, this phenomenon is mostly related to the presence of surface traps in the radiative transition process.43 Trapping states with varying energy levels are established by the different oxygen surface functional groups (C–O and CO) present in the CDs. Hence, by varying the excitation energy, the fluorescence emission can be changed. The maximum intensity emission peak is obtained at 442 nm, associated with blue coloured fluorescence (29% quantum yield (see the ESI†)). Fig. 7 (inset, bottom right) shows the corresponding digital photograph of water dispersed CDs at an excitation wavelength of 360 nm. Interestingly, as shown in Fig. 7 (inset, top right) , the CDs also display exceptional upconversion PL properties. When excited by long-wavelength light (600–800 nm), the upconverted emission peaks appear in the range from 360 nm to 450 nm. The multi-photon active process has been reported to be the main reason for this occurrence, a process in which two or more photons are concurrently absorbed resulting in a shorter wavelength emission in comparison with the longer wavelength excitation (anti-Stokes type emission).19

3.2 Photo-electrocatalytic activity of the CD sensitized TiO2 supported Pt nanocomposites
As a preliminary step towards exploring the catalytic activity of Pt supported on CD sensitized TiO2 for MOR, its presence was assessed by CV measurements. The cyclic voltammograms were acquired in an electrolyte solution comprising 0.5 M H2SO4 at a scan rate of 20 mV s−1. Characteristic hydrogen adsorption/desorption peaks can be seen along with Pt oxidation and Pt oxide reduction peaks in Fig. 8, affirming the presence of Pt in the composite catalysts. The electrochemical active surface areas (EASAs) of the Pt based catalysts were determined by integrating the area of the hydrogen adsorption/desorption peaks of the CV curves. Assuming that Pt requires a 0.21 mC cm−2 electrical charge for monolayer adsorption/desorption of hydrogen, the EASA can be estimated by eqn (2): (2)where qH is the electrical charge of hydrogen adsorption/desorption obtained from the integrated CV peak area after double layer correction and mPt is the Pt loading on the working electrode. The EASA of the Pt3/CD2/TiO2 catalyst is estimated to be 88.49 m2 gPt−1 while that of Pt3.5/TiO2, calculated in a similar way, is 65.86 m2 gPt−1. This suggests that the electrochemical accessibility of Pt3/CD2/TiO2 is much better than that of Pt3.5/TiO2, which is a crucial requirement for MOR. Electrical conductivity is an important parameter that affects EASA.44 CDs prepared from citric acid have been previously reported to be conducting in nature.45 The higher conductivity of Pt3/CD2/TiO2 (0.7 S m−1) in comparison with Pt3.5/TiO2 (0.05 S m−1) due to the presence of CDs facilitates the transfer of electrons and also hastens the mass-transfer kinetics at the surface of the electrode, resulting in a larger EASA.
 Fig. 8  Cyclic voltammograms of Pt3/CD2/TiO2 and Pt3.5/TiO2 catalysts measured in 0.5 M H2SO4 aqueous electrolyte at a scan rate of 20 mV s−1. 

Fig. 9(a) shows a representative set of CV profiles for TiO2 supported Pt before and after simulated solar light illumination, measured in an electrolytic solution of 0.5 M CH3OH and 0.5 M H2SO4. The anodic peak in the forward scan appearing at approximately 0.63 V is generally considered the primary peak of MOR. A second anodic peak also appears during the backward scan at around 0.53 V. Goodenough's team was the first to ascribe this peak to the oxidation of residual intermediate carbon species like CO.46 CO poisoning is highly detrimental to the performance of a catalyst, hence it is beneficial to evaluate the susceptibility of the catalyst towards it. Following the work of Goodenough, many researchers have since then reported that the CO tolerance can be determined from the ratio of the forward scan peak current (If) to the backward scan peak current (Ib).47 From this definition, it can be interpreted that a smaller value of Ib, i.e., a higher If/Ib ratio, indicates that CO-like intermediates are eliminated to a great extent during the forward scan. In the case of TiO2 supported Pt catalysts, an increased current response is observed in terms of the two peaks when they are under irradiation. The peak current densities of Pty/CD0/TiO2 (or denoted simply as Pty/TiO2 since the amount of CD is zero) composites are listed in the form of a bar diagram in Fig. 9(b). The photo-electrocatalyst Pt3.5/TiO2 shows the best performance with an If value of 1.16 mA cm−2, which has an increase of 24% compared to the condition when no light source is present.
 Fig. 9  (a) A representative set of CV profiles of the Pt3.5/TiO2 catalyst measured in 0.5 M CH3OH + 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte at a scan rate of 20 mV s−1 in the presence and absence of simulated solar light irradiation and (b) a bar diagrammatic representation of the forward and backward current densities for different compositions of Pty/TiO2 catalysts under dark and light conditions. 
The contribution to the catalytic activity of Pty/TiO2 comes from two different processes of both the components occurring concurrently. Pt acts as an electro-catalyst in the MOR and is involved in the stripping off of four hydrogen atoms of methanol through a set of reactions which ultimately releases CO2.48 The reactions described in eqn 3(a)–(d) occur on the Pt surface sites (PtS), causing chemisorption of CO molecules. CH3OH + PtS → PtS − CH2OH + H+ + e−(3(a)) PtS − CH2OH → PtS − CHOH + H+ + e−(3(b)) PtS − CHOH → PtS − COH + H+ + e−(3(c)) PtS − CHOH → PtS − CO + H+ + e−(3(d))
Now, the conversion of the chemisorbed CO to CO2 is a crucial step in the MOR. Initially proposed by Gilman, the electrochemical oxidation of CO to CO2 follows a “reactant-pair” mechanism.49 This now-accepted mechanism to release CO2 follows a Langmuir–Hinshelwood type reaction between CO and a hydroxyl moiety (–OH) produced by the oxidation of water on an adjacent site (eqn 3(e) and (f)). PtS + H2O → PtS − OH + H+ + e−(3(e)) PtS − OH  + PtS − CO → 2PtS + CO2 + H+ + e−(3(f))
TiO2, on the other hand, serves as a photo-catalyst in MOR. The photo-oxidation of methanol generally proceeds via hydroxymethyl radical (˙CH2OH) formation resulting in the release of CO2.50,51 Under UV light irradiation, free electrons and holes are generated within the conduction band (CB) and the valence band (VB), respectively (eqn 4(a)). The holes then reach the surface of TiO2 and are trapped at the band gap surface states. They may then react with terminal OH− groups to generate ˙OH radicals (eqn 4(b)), which assist in the oxidation of non-adsorbed methanol to ˙CH2OH radicals (eqn 4(c)). Alternatively, the holes can also oxidize the adsorbed methanol to ˙CH2OH radicals (eqn 4(d)). In the presence of oxygen, a series of reactions takes place, terminating with the release of CO2 (eqn 4(e)–(g)). TiO2 + hν(≥Eg) → h+VB + e−CB(4(a)) OH− + h+VB → ˙OH(4(b)) (CH3OH)sol + ˙OH → CH2OH˙ + H+(4(c)) (CH3OH)ads + h+VB → ˙CH2OH + H+(4(d)) ˙CH2OH + O2 → HCOH + O2−˙ + H+(4(e)) HCHO + 1/2O2 → HCOOH(4(f)) HCOOH + 1/2O2 → CO2 + H2O(4(g))
TiO2 is an n-type semiconductor and with the loading of Pt, a Schottky barrier is formed at their interface.52,53 Recombination of photo-generated electrons and holes is suppressed within the space charge region by the large electric field, which helps in the migration of electrons from TiO2 to Pt, with Pt acting as an electron scavenger. With the increase in the loading of Pt, the space charge region becomes increasingly narrower. Consequently, the catalytic activity increases till an optimum composition is obtained with a 3.5 wt% Pt content, as is evident from Fig. 9(b). At this particular Pt loading, the thickness of the space charge region can be considered approximately equal to the penetration depth of the photons. However, with a further increase in Pt content, the space charge layer becomes too narrow such that the photon penetration depth exceeds its thickness. In that case, the recombination of electron–hole pairs becomes much easier and the catalytic activity deteriorates.
The current densities for different compositions of the composite (Pty/CDx/TiO2) with varying Pt contents are shown in Fig. 10(a) and (b). The highest If value is attained with the Pt3/CD2/TiO2 catalyst (2.50 mA cm−2) in the presence of solar light simulation. This value is considerably higher than the value obtained with Pt3.5/TiO2 as well as Pt3/CD2/TiO2 under dark conditions. Fig. 10(c) shows another set of CV curves for MOR when the TiO2 supported Pt catalyst is sensitized by CDs. The If and Ib values show a considerable increase with respect to those obtained prior to CD sensitization. The role of CDs can be suggested to be two-fold in this case: alleviation of CO poisoning and sensitizing TiO2 nanoparticles to the visible solar light spectrum via upconversion phenomenon. With regard to monitoring the CO poisoning effect on Pt catalytic sites, considering If/Ib as an indicator, an increase in its value with the addition of CDs is clearly seen. For TiO2 supported Pt (Pt3.5/TiO2), this value is 1.13. On sensitizing with CDs (Pt3/CD2/TiO2), this value rises to 1.75. A couple of possibilities have been suggested for the CO poisoning alleviating effect by CDs. For instance, Pan et al. have mentioned an alternate route for water activation on the surface of CDs to form chemisorbed hydroxyl groups, which in turn speed up the oxidation of the chemisorbed CO.27 CO2 is formed as a product, thereby cleaning up the Pt surface for further MOR (eqn 5(a) and (b)). This process is quite similar to the one occurring on the TiO2 surface that has been reported by Chen et al., wherein TiO2 promotes the activation of water (eqn 5(c) and (d)).54 CD + H2O → CD − OH + H+ + e−(5(a)) CD − OH + PtS − CO → CD + PtS + CO2 + H+ + e−(5(b)) TiO2 + H2O → TiO2 − OH + H+ + e−(5(c)) TiO2 − OH + PtS − CO → TiO2 + PtS + CO2 + H+ + e−(5(d))

On the other hand, experiments carried out by Sun et al. have revealed that the binding energy of CO on the Pt surface is weakened by the presence of oxygen-containing groups on the CD surface.25,26 As a result, CO is stripped off from its surface. The effect of oxygen-containing groups in lowering the PtS–CO binding energy has also been verified by density functional theory computations by Sharma et al.55
Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) experiments were also carried out with the Pty/CD2/TiO2 catalyst in the same electrochemical environment (Fig. 10(d)). The LSV plots reveal that the Pt3/CD2/TiO2 photo-electrocatalyst under simulated solar light exhibits the maximum oxidation current and the most negative onset potential of MOR, corroborating the results obtained from the CV measurements.
CDs act as a powerful energy transfer component in the photo-electrocatalytic design due to their upconversion properties. Based on this, the role of CDs in the catalytic process has been proposed, as illustrated in Scheme 2. Two types of energy transfer processes occur between CDs and TiO2 nanoparticles.56 Firstly, on excitation with visible light, electrons and holes are generated within the CDs. These photo-induced electrons are then injected from the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level of CDs to the CB of TiO2 (P1) and contribute to the photocurrent of the system.20 The second possibility is that photo-generated electrons and holes recombine and then emit photons of higher energy (upconversion) (P2). The higher energy photons can then excite TiO2 for further photo-catalysis of methanol.19

MOR primarily proceeds in the presence of ˙OH radicals. In order to verify the enhancement of the photo-catalytic activity of CD/TiO2 by visible light illumination, the relative presence of ˙OH radicals in a TiO2 suspension before and after CD sensitization was determined by fluorescence measurements. Terephthalic acid (TA) is a well-established fluorescence dosimeter for ˙OH radicals.57 The detection of ˙OH radicals is based on the conversion of non-fluorescent TA into highly fluorescent 2-hydroxyterephthalic acid (HTA) with an emission maximum at 426 nm. Thus, the amount of ˙OH radicals generated during UV-visible light irradiation can be quantitatively evaluated by monitoring the fluorescence intensity at 426 nm.58Fig. 11(a) reveals good photo-catalytic stability by virtue of a linear response in the increase in PL intensity with irradiation time. A significant PL intensity is associated with the TiO2 suspension, which is an indication of the formation of ˙OH radicals by photo-excited holes of TiO2 under simulated solar light illumination. However, the amount of ˙OH radicals present in the CD2/TiO2 suspension is considerably greater. This suggests that simulated solar light driven ˙OH radical generation by the CD sensitized TiO2 nanoparticles is higher in density as compared to that generated by pure TiO2.
 Fig. 11  (a) Plot of PL intensities of the supernatants of TiO2 and CD2/TiO2 suspensions under simulated solar light irradiation as a function of time, recorded at 426 nm (λex = 320 nm), and (b) chronoamperometric curves of Pt3/CD2/TiO2 and Pt3.5/TiO2 electrodes recorded in 0.5 M CH3OH + 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte at a fixed potential of 0.6 V with intermittent irradiation cycles. 
The chronoamperometric technique was applied to study the contribution of photocurrent to the total current density. A fixed potential of 0.6 V was applied and the corresponding chronoamperograms with intermittent illumination for 30 s in repeated off–on cycles were recorded in an electrolyte of 0.5 M CH3OH and 0.5 M H2SO4, as shown in Fig. 11(b). Both Pt3/CD2/TiO2 and Pt3.5/TiO2 catalysts demonstrate fast and consistent transitory photocurrent responses. Initially, the catalysts exhibit a relatively lower current density value in accordance with the CV data. Then with illumination, the current gradually begins to increase, followed by a drop as soon as it is turned off. This is a further confirmation that MOR is greatly enhanced by UV-visible light irradiation through a photo-catalytic process. It is also noteworthy that Pt3/CD2/TiO2 presents a better response than Pt3.5/TiO2, indicating that it exhibits a higher efficiency for the separation of photo-generated electrons and holes and their transfer.
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was employed as an investigative tool to study the changes in electron transport behaviour of the electrodes with/without the addition of CDs in the composite, as well as in the absence/presence of simulated solar light irradiation. A 1:1 mixture of 25 mM K3[Fe(CN)6/K4[Fe(CN)6] in 0.1 M KCl solution was used as the electrolyte. The data collected in the 0.1 Hz to 100 kHz range were plotted in accordance with the equivalent circuit, as shown in the top right inset of Fig. 12(a), which includes the series resistance (RS), the charge transfer resistance (RCT), the Warburg impedance (W) and the double-layer capacitance (CD). The arc of the semi-circle in the Nyquist plot establishes the RCT value. From Fig. 12(a), it can be suggested that the Pt3/CD2/TiO2 electrode shows better interfacial charge transfer than Pt3.5/TiO2 since the diameter of the arc is noticeably smaller. Considering the diameter of the arc to be a reflection of the rate of the catalytic reaction occurring at the electrode's surface,29 the smaller arc is also a clear indication of improved electronic conductivity caused by the CDs. Table S1† shows the values of RS and RCT for all the compositions of Pty/CD2/TiO2 under light and dark conditions. Similarly, an enhanced charge transfer can be seen on the photo-illuminated Pt3/CD2/TiO2 electrode (Fig. 12a (top left inset), confirming the promotional effect of simulated solar light illumination towards the mobility of charges at the electrode's surface. Thus, it can be inferred that the Pt3/CD2/TiO2 electrode is a more efficient photo-electrocatalyst for MOR, with good stability under simulated solar light, as shown in Fig. 12(b). The decay in current over time is most probably due to the lowering of EASA caused by accumulation of different intermediate species generated during MOR.

4. Conclusion
In conclusion, we have designed a novel CD sensitized TiO2 supported Pt catalyst for MOR by following a simple route combining hydrothermal methods and chemical reduction. A series of catalysts with different wt% of CDs and Pt loadings were fabricated, and the catalyst (Pt3/CD2/TiO2) exhibiting the best performance in terms of catalytic activity, CO poison tolerance and stability was established by means of different electrochemical tests. Owing to the unique upconversion properties of CDs, these catalysts can easily absorb visible light photons from sunlight and convert them into high energy photons to subsequently excite the TiO2 nanoparticles. The superior performance of these catalysts is attributed to the two types of catalytic processes occurring simultaneously: photo-catalysis due to CD sensitized TiO2 and electro-catalysis due to the presence of Pt. This work shows CDs in a new light as inhibitors of CO poisoning as well as harvesters of visible sunlight. The multi-faceted CDs, thus, can provide new possibilities for the rational design of photo-electrocatalysts which can find potential application as anode materials in DMFCs.
