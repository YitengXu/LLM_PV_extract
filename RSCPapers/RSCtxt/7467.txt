    , Accepted 9th October 2017First published on 9th October 2017AbstractPolyaniline (PANI)-decorated Bi2MoO6 nanosheets (BMO/PANI) were prepared by a facile solvothermal method. Different characterization techniques, including X-ray powder diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, diffuse reflectance ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy, photoluminescence spectroscopy, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, photocurrent spectroscopy, and nanosecond time-resolved emission studies, have been employed to investigate the structure, optical and electrical properties of the BMO/PANI composites. The wide absorption of the samples in the visible light region makes them suitable for nonlinear transmission and photocatalytic activity studies. The associated photocatalytic activity and optical nonlinearities for the BMO/PANI composites are shown to be dependent on the PANI loadings. The rational mechanisms responsible for deteriorating pollutants and improving optical nonlinearities were also proposed, which could be mainly attributed to the efficient interfacial charge transfer and the interfacial electronic interactions between PANI and Bi2MoO6. The photoluminescence spectroscopy, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and photocurrent spectroscopy studies confirmed that the interface charge separation efficiency was greatly improved by coupling Bi2MoO6 with PANI. The tuning of photocatalysis and nonlinear optical behaviors with variation in the content of PANI provides an easy way to attain tunable properties, which are exceedingly required in optoelectronics applications.
1. Introduction
The widespread use of laser technology in various fields of human activities has led to the need for optical materials with specific properties, in particular, nonlinear optical performances.1–4 Semiconductors and their composites have received great attention in the fields of photonics and optoelectronics, and various other fields owing to their high molar extinction coefficients, broad absorption and narrow emission spectra, and size tunability.5 The quantum and dielectric confinement effects in the semiconductors make them a promising class of third-order nonlinear optical materials working at off resonance as well as at resonance with self-healing ability, large damage threshold, and fast time response.6–8 Among the conducting polymers, polyaniline (PANI) with an extended π-conjugated system is very attractive for electronic and photonic applications because of its ultrafast response, high damage thresholds and absorption coefficients, high mobility of charge carriers, and good environmental stability.9,10 Using the Z-scan technique, Petrov and coworkers found that a nanocomposite of PANI with polyvinyl alcohol at 532 nm had suitable nonlinear optical properties.11 Indeed, optical nonlinearities including nonlinear optical absorption and refraction of nanomaterials can be tuned with respect to their shape, size and composition, and likewise, control of their optical limiting response is desirable for high end applications.12,13
On the other hand, composites of conducting polymers and semiconductors have received great attention due to the recent interest in new catalysts.14,15 The bismuth-based semiconductor, Bi2MoO6, is considered to be an ideal photocatalyst for water splitting and degradation of organic pollutants. Nevertheless, the poor quantum yield due to the rapid recombination rate of photo-induced electrons and holes that exists in Bi2MoO6 badly hinders its applications in pollutant decomposition.16 Therefore, a lot of Bi2MoO6-based heterostructure photocatalysts have been designed and prepared to hinder recombination and enhance its photocatalytic efficiency.17,18 Recently, some studies have clearly demonstrated that the combination of PANI with semiconductor photocatalysts including Bi2O2CO3,14 BiOCl,19 g-C3N420 and Bi2WO621 can obviously improve their photocatalytic activities.
Remarkably, the optical nonlinearities and photocatalysis in a coupled system are found to be better than those of the individual systems due to the combination of nonlinear/photocatalytic mechanisms occurring in the independent systems. For example, the photocatalytic and nonlinear optical behaviors of transition metal (Fe, Co and Ni) oxide nanoparticle grafted graphitic carbon nitrides12 and the ternary system Bi2O2CO3/polypyrrole/g-C3N422 have been exploited, respectively, revealing a significant enhancement in photocatalysis and optical nonlinearities in comparison with those of their precursors. Zhao and coworkers have also demonstrated that the BiOCl/Bi2MoO6/g-C3N4 nanocomposite exhibited a notably enhanced visible-light photocurrent response, photocatalytic activity and nonlinear optical property, and could be used as a recyclable photocatalyst and optical limiter.23 In view of the unique photoelectric performances of Bi2MoO6 and PANI, it is of significant interest to design novel functional materials combining the distinct optoelectronic properties of the independent systems in a suitable form. Following this line of research, we attempt to evaluate the impact of the PANI content on the photocatalytic and nonlinear optical activities of BMO/PANI composites. However, to the best of our knowledge, no attempts have been made to evaluate the photocatalytic and nonlinear optical applications of BMO/PANI composites by changing the mass ratios of PANI to Bi2MoO6.
In this study, PANI-decorated Bi2MoO6 nanosheets (BMO/PANI) were prepared using a facile solvothermal method. The optical nonlinearities including nonlinear optical absorption and refraction, and photocatalytic performances of the samples were investigated from an application point of view. The strong interfacial interactions between Bi2MoO6 and PANI have a significant effect on their light absorption and photogenerated charge separation and transfer processes, which finally resulted in a notably enhanced photocatalytic activity and optical nonlinearities. These results suggest that the samples are capable of exhibiting dual functionality, both as efficient photocatalysts and optical limiters, which may provide some hints for the in-depth and comprehensive understanding of the interfacial interactions between semiconductors and PANI, to develop highly efficient photocatalysts and optical limiters.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Materials and reagents
All chemicals in this study are analytical grade, and are used as received unless otherwise stated. Distilled water is used in all our experiments. Rhodamine (RhB), bismuth nitrate (Bi(NO3)3·5H2O) and sodium molybdate (Na2MoO4·2H2O) were purchased from Shanghai Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd, China. PANI was prepared according to a previous report.10
2.2. Preparation of BMO/PANI composites
The BMO/PANI composites were synthesized using a facile solvothermal method. In a typical procedure, 0.44 mmol of Bi(NO3)3·5H2O and 0.22 mmol of Na2MoO4·2H2O were added to 30 mL of an ethylene glycol solution, and sonicated for 20 min to obtain a homogeneous suspension. Then, a certain amount of PANI was added and ultrasonicated for another 30 min to be completely dispersed. Subsequently, the mixture solution was transferred into a 50 mL Teflon-lined stainless autoclave and heated at 120 °C for 12 h. After cooling down to room temperature, the precipitate was centrifuged and washed with EtOH and deionized water several times, and finally dried under vacuum at room temperature for 12 h. For the purpose of comparison, pure Bi2MoO6 was also prepared using the same procedures in the absence of PANI. To investigate the effect of PANI on the photosensitized activities including optical nonlinearities and photocatalytic performances, a series of BMO/PANI composites with different PANI mass ratios from 0.70% to 2.00% was prepared, and the corresponding samples were denoted as BMO/PANI0.70%, BMO/PANI0.90%, BMO/PANI1.00%, BMO/PANI1.25%, BMO/PANI1.75%, and BMO/PANI2.00%, respectively.
2.3. Characterization
The Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of the as-prepared samples were acquired with a MB154S-FTIR spectrometer (Bomem, Canada) using conventional KBr pellets with a diffuse reflectance accessory at room temperature. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the powders were acquired at room temperature using an XD-3 diffractometer (Beijing Purkinje General Instrument Co. Ltd, China) with Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 0.15418 nm). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) experiments were performed using a JEM-2100 (JEOL), working at 200 kV. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were measured using a Model S-4800 Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope instrument (Hitachi High-Technologies Corporation, Japan) equipped with an energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscope (EDS). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was recorded on an RBD upgraded PHI-5000C ESCA (Perkin-Elmer) electron spectrometer with a monochromatic Mg Kα source at 280 eV to test the surface compositions of the samples. The nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms were recorded by using a Tristar II 3020 Surface Area and Porosity Analyzer (Micromeritics Instrument Corporation, USA). Pore size distributions were obtained by the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method using adsorption data. The optical absorption characteristics are determined with UV-Vis diffuse reflection spectra by using a Varian Cary 500 spectrophotometer in the range 200–800 nm with a BaSO4 pellet as the reference. The steady-state and nanosecond transient fluorescence spectra were both carried out on a Fluoro-Max-P spectrofluorimeter. A Xe light was used as the light source for steady-state spectra with excitation wavelength of 337 nm, while a 337 nm wavelength pulse laser was used for nanosecond transient spectra. Raman spectra were acquired at room temperature by using a Renishawin Via Raman Microscope (Renishaw, Britain) with argon ion Ar+ laser radiation (532 nm); the laser light was focused onto the samples by using a microscope equipped with a 100× objective.
2.4. Measurement of photoelectrochemistry, optical nonlinearity and photocatalysis
The photoelectrochemical measurements were carried out using an electrochemical workstation (CHI 614D, CH Instrument) with a three-electrode quartz cell. Pt wire (1 × 1 cm2) was used as the counter electrode, and a silver/silver chloride (Ag/AgCl) electrode was used as the reference electrode. The as-prepared sample film electrodes on the fluorine-doped indium tin oxide (ITO) substrate with an area of 0.7854 cm2 were utilized as the working electrodes. 0.2 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution was used as the electrolyte solution for the photoelectrochemical measurements. A 350 W xenon arc lamp was utilized as the light source, and the incident density of illumination was adjusted to 100 mW cm−2 before each experiment. All investigated electrodes have a similar film thickness. The transient photocurrent-time dependent experiments and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were carried out at open circuit potential.
The nonlinear optical properties including nonlinear absorption and refraction by means of the Z-scan technique were measured, employing linearly polarized 4 ns pulsed laser radiation at 532 nm delivered by a mode-locked Nd:YAG laser with a repetition rate of 2 Hz. A lens of 25 cm focal length was used to focus the laser pulses. The sample was mounted on a translation stage, and then moved along the axis of the incident beam (Z-direction) with respect to the focal point (Z = 0). Input energy and the transmitted energy were monitored simultaneously by two pyroelectric energy probes (Rjp-765 energy probe), which were linked to a computer by a GPIB interface. The sample experiences a different energy density at each position as it moves along the Z direction. For the open-aperture Z-scan technique, the aperture is absent. The graph plotted between Z position and the normalized transmittance of the sample is known as the open-aperture Z-scan curve, which reveals the nature of the absorptive optical nonlinearity alone in the system. Division of the Z-scan curve obtained with an aperture by that without an aperture gives a curve with nonlinear absorption effectively eliminated, and affords the nonlinear refraction response.
Photocatalytic degradation experiments were conducted in a Pyrex photocatalytic reactor surrounded by circulating water to cool the lamp. The photocatalytic activity of the BMO/PANI composites was evaluated by photocatalytic degradation of RhB in aqueous solution using a 350 W Xe-lamp (Nanshen Company, Shanghai) as the simulated light source. For each experiment, 50 mg of the photocatalyst was suspended in 50 mL RhB aqueous solution (0.5 mM, pH value: 7). Before irradiation, the suspensions were magnetically stirred in the dark for about 30 min to achieve the adsorption–desorption equilibrium between the dyes and the catalyst surface. During the RhB photodecomposition process, 3.0 mL of the suspension was collected at given irradiation time intervals, and immediately centrifuged to remove the photocatalyst particles. The filtrate was then analyzed using a UV-vis spectrophotometer (UV-2450, Shimadau) to record the concentration changes of RhB solutions at the absorption wavelength of 554 nm. The total organic carbon (TOC) removal efficiency was investigated by the Liqui TOC II analyzer, Elementar, Germany. To investigate the active species generated during the photocatalytic process, the active species trapping experiments were performed by adding 1 mmol t-Butanol (TBA), benzoquinone (BQ) and EDTA, respectively.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Structure, composition and morphology
In order to explore the effect of the structure on the photosensitized activities of BMO/PANI composites, multiple techniques were employed. The chemical composition of the BMO/PANI composites was investigated by FTIR spectroscopy, the results being shown in Fig. 1. In the FTIR spectrum of Bi2MoO6, the absorption band located at 738 cm−1 is ascribed to the asymmetric stretching mode of MoO6 including vibrations of the equatorial oxygen atoms, whereas the band at 582 cm−1 is related to the bending vibration of the MoO6 octahedron.24 The other two characteristic features are the absorption peaks at 803 and 848 cm−1, corresponding to the symmetric and asymmetric vibration modes (Mo–O stretching) of the corner sharing (MoO6)6− octahedron.18 In the case of the BMO/PANI composites, the characteristic bands for Bi2MoO6 still remain, which imply the existence of Bi2MoO6, whereas the band vibration of PANI cannot be observed obviously (Fig. 1). The main reason might be that the PANI entered the laminates of Bi2MoO6, and became highly dispersed in the composites or the loading amount of PANI is very low.25 The Bi2MoO6 nanosheets can interact with the PANI nanorods through physisorption, electrostatic binding, interfacial electronic and/or charge transfer interactions. From the FTIR spectra, a little red-shift for the characteristic peaks of Bi2MoO6 in the BMO/PANI composites can be observed, confirming that there is an intense interfacial interaction between Bi2MoO6 and PANI. XRD was further performed to determine the structural information of the as-prepared samples (Fig. 2). As we can see, four obvious peaks located at 28.2°, 32.6°, 46.5° and 54.9° have been observed for Bi2MoO6, which matched well with the (131), (002), (060) and (331) crystal planes of Bi2MoO6.16,17 With regard to the BMO/PANI composites, only the peak of the Bi2MoO6 crystal can be detected. Generally, PANI exhibits a broad peak at approximately 20–25° (for comparative purposes, the XRD spectrum of PANI is also provided in ESI,† Fig. S1). However, no such characteristic peak of PANI is detected, implying a very low loading amount of PANI and high dispersion of PANI in the composites, consistent with the results of FTIR, and similar results can also be found in other systems.14 In addition, some peak shift was also observed when the PANI was introduced into the Bi2MoO6, revealing that the formation of the hybrid materials with the present content of PANI has an obvious effect on the crystal phase of Bi2MoO6.

Raman spectra have been proven to be a very effective tool in the characterization of the structure of different materials. The obtained Raman spectra of different BMO/PANI samples are shown in Fig. 3, which confirmed the existence of PANI in the composites. For Bi2MoO6, Raman bands observed below 400 cm−1 were ascribed to the bending, wagging and external modes by directly correlating the Mo–O bond lengths, while those above 600 cm−1 were assigned the Mo–O stretches.26,27 The chemical treatment with PANI results in the appearance of a number of characteristic bands, mainly in the spectral range of 1000–1800 cm−1 (Fig. 3). The major bands were ascribed to characteristic fundamental vibrations of the functional groups, consistent with successful introduction of PANI into the composites.28 Compared to Bi2MoO6, the Raman spectra of the BMO/PANI composites exhibited several distinct changes including the decrease in intensity, shift in position and broadening of the Mo–O stretching Raman bands, indicating the crystallinity weakening after coupling with PANI, consistent with the results of XRD. These results suggested that the surface chemical environment in the BMO/PANI composites has been changed, which can be attributed to the presence of interactions between Bi2MoO6 and PANI in the BMO/PANI samples. These changes are in good agreement with those reported by Li et al. who prepared Ag quantum dot modified BiOBr ultrathin nanosheets.29 ESI,† Fig. S2 shows the XPS survey scan spectrum of the BMO/PANI1.00% composite. As depicted in Fig. S2, this clearly indicates that the sample is mainly composed of elements including Bi, Mo, O, C and N, which is the chemical composition of the composite material. The high-resolution XPS spectrum of the Bi 4f region is seen in Fig. 4a, and the peaks located at 159.3 and 164.6 eV can be ascribed to Bi 4f7/2 and Bi 4f5/2, respectively, suggesting that the Bi is in the form of Bi3+.30Fig. 4b displays the binding energies of Mo 3d5/2 and Mo 3d3/2 in the BMO/PANI1.00% composite, which are centered at 232.6 and 235.7 eV, respectively, indicating that a six-valent oxidation state for Mo6+ exists in the composites.17Fig. 4c shows the core-level spectra of N 1s of BMO/PANI1.00%. The three peaks at 396.9, 398.1 and 399.1 eV can be attributed to the imine, amine and cationic nitrogen, respectively.31 This evidence matches up with the Raman data, further proving the coexistence of Bi2MoO6 and PANI.

The morphology and nanostructures of the products were characterized by using SEM and TEM. Fig. 5 displays the SEM images of PANI, Bi2MoO6, and BMO/PANI1.00%. It can be seen that the PANI exhibits a nanorod oriented-stacking morphology with a length of around hundreds of nanometers (Fig. 5a). The pure Bi2MoO6 reveals a lamellar structure composed of a large quantity of aggregated nanosheets (Fig. 5b). After coupling with PANI, significant structural and morphological changes were observed for BMO/PANI1.00% (Fig. 5c). This suggests that the introduction of PANI may affect the rate of reaction then lead to the difference in crystallinity. The SEM result was consistent with the XRD and Raman analysis, further indicating that the crystal structure of Bi2MoO6 has been changed with PANI addition in the hydrothermal synthesis. More detailed structural information of the as-prepared samples is provided by TEM analysis (Fig. 6, for comparative purposes, the TEM images of PANI are also provided in the ESI,† Fig. S3). Fig. 6a shows the TEM image of Bi2MoO6 nanosheets with soft edges and a smooth surface, which agrees well with that revealed by the SEM image (Fig. 5b). In particular, these nanosheets are very thin and are mostly transparent under an electron beam. The BMO/PANI1.00% nanocomposite is composed of irregular rodlike and platelet-shaped structures (Fig. 6b). The thin layers of Bi2MoO6 may act as a bed for anchoring nanorods of PANI. In addition, the BMO/PANI1.00% nanocomposite has been ultrasonicated for 30 min before TEM analysis, indicating that the interfacial interactions between Bi2MoO6 and PANI should be quite strong. The observed irregular multi-plate structure with rough surfaces suggests a possibility of a plate-on-plate structure by placing Bi2MoO6 and PANI on each other, which results in the formation of a heterogeneous interface rather than a simple physical mixture.

Fig. 7 displays the elemental mapping images of the BMO/PANI1.00% nanocomposite, which were used to further characterize the composition and mixing quality in the interior of the sample. The analysis demonstrated that the composite is composed of the elements Bi, O, Mo, C and N, with the content was determined to be 79.69 wt%, 7.87 wt%, 8.85 wt%, 3.08 wt% and 0.51 wt%, respectively. These results indicate that most nanoparticles of Bi2MoO6 and PANI are mixed homogeneously, because in most regions that Bi, O and Mo can be found, signals from C and N can be detected simultaneously. Taken together, all of the above results clearly demonstrated that the BMO/PANI1.00% heterostructures were successfully fabricated.

To get insight into the roles of PANI in tuning the superficial microstructures of Bi2MoO6, the samples were characterized by the typical nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms. The nitrogen sorption isotherm of BMO/PANI1.00% is similar to that of Bi2MoO6, and belongs to the type IV with a clear hysteresis loop in the relative pressure between 0.8 and 1.0 (Fig. 8), indicating the formation of mesoporous structures due to the inter-nanosheet spacing.32 The BET specific surface areas of Bi2MoO6 and BMO/PANI1.00% are 11.45 and 25.49 m2 g−1, respectively, suggesting that the introduction of PANI is beneficial for increasing the specific surface area of BMO/PANI1.00%. In addition, the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method was used to determine the pore volumes of Bi2MoO6 and BMO/PANI1.00% (inset in Fig. 8), which were calculated to be 0.057 and 0.12 cm3 g−1 for Bi2MoO6 and BMO/PANI1.00%, respectively. From the pore volume distribution curves, it can be observed that the introduction of PANI has a significant effect on the pore size and pore volume, resulting in an improved specific surface area. Combined with the micrograph of BMO/PANI1.00%, it can be concluded that the Bi2MoO6 substrate provides the ideal deposition support for PANI. The interactions of Bi2MoO6 and PANI can promote the electron transfer within the composites.

3.2. The interfacial interactions, band structure and photogenerated carrier behaviors
The interactions between Bi2MoO6 and PANI, which have a significant effect on their band structures, were further investigated using the UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectra (Fig. 9). As evident in Fig. 9, the optical absorption edge of Bi2MoO6 is determined to be 481 nm, which is lower than that of BMO/PANI1.00% (507 nm). In comparison with pristine Bi2MoO6, the BMO/PANI1.00% composite displays a stronger visible light absorption in the range of 450–800 nm due to the high absorption coefficient of PANI. The increase of the visible light absorption allows for more efficient utilization of the solar spectrum to create more photogenerated electrons and holes.14 The steep shape of the spectra indicates that the visible light absorption is ascribed to a band-gap transition rather than a transition induced by impurity levels.33,34 Due to the strong interactions between Bi2MoO6 and PANI, the band gap (Eg) of BMO/PANI1.00% calculated by means of Kubelka–Munk theory has an obvious change, which is determined to be 2.45 eV, obviously smaller than that of Bi2MoO6 (2.58 eV). The band structure is responsible for the difficulty degree of the electronic transitions. In general, a lower band gap was beneficial for the electronic transitions.35,36 In addition, the valence band (VB) of Bi2MoO6 and BMO/PANI1.00% is investigated by XPS valence spectra, the result being shown in Fig. 4d. The VB maximum of BMO/PANI1.00% is 1.54 eV, which is 0.16 eV higher than that of Bi2MoO6 (1.38 eV). According to the formula ECB = EVB − Eg and the Eg value obtained from the optical absorption spectra, the conduction band (CB) minimum of BMO/PANI1.00% and Bi2MoO6 can be determined to be −0.91 and −1.20 eV, respectively. Therefore, the interfacial interactions between Bi2MoO6 and PANI resulted in a 0.16 eV shifting of the VB, suggesting that a stronger oxidative power of photogenerated holes in the composites.14,37

The charge transfer and separation efficiency plays a very important role in the photocatalysis and optical nonlinearity. As is known, a weaker fluorescence intensity represents a lower recombination probability of photogenerated charge carriers.38 Hence, the steady-state fluorescence spectra and nanosecond time-resolved transient fluorescence decay were carried out to study the photogenerated charge carrier behaviors. As shown in Fig. 10a, the pristine Bi2MoO6 exhibits a strong fluorescence peak centered at around 473 nm under the excitation wavelength of 337 nm, suggesting more recombination of photogenerated hole and electron pairs on the surface of Bi2MoO6. After the introduction of PANI, the fluorescence intensity of Bi2MoO6 is obviously decreased. This implies that the BMO/PANI1.00% composite has a much lower recombination rate of photogenerated charge carriers.29 Furthermore, the nanosecond time-resolved transient fluorescence spectrum of BMO/PANI1.00% (Fig. 10b) shows lower decay (0.985 ns) than that of pure Bi2MoO6 (0.731 ns), which is similar to a recent report on the Bi2MoO6–BiOCl nanocomposite.16

Based on the above experimental results, it is believed that the introduction of PANI can reduce the electron and hole recombination rate, which favors the effective separation of photogenerated charge carriers. To further prove this assumption, transient photocurrent and EIS measurements were also carried out. The transient photocurrent properties of PANI, Bi2MoO6, and BMO/PANI1.00% were obtained under several on/off sunlight irradiation cycles shown in Fig. 11. After irradiation by light, the photocurrent is generated by separation and transportation of the photoinduced charges to the working electrodes. When the light is switched on, the photocurrent responses of the working electrodes are obviously increased, originating from the fast separation of the photoinduced charge carriers.39 In contrast, when the light is turned off, the photocurrent is very low, and maintains its dark current state. The BMO/PANI1.00% composite exhibits a higher transient photocurrent density than PANI and Bi2MoO6, which indicates that the separation efficiency of photogenerated charge carriers is significantly improved at their interface, thus extending the lifetime of the electron–hole pairs effectively. These results can be further supported by EIS analysis (Fig. 12). The arc radius in EIS spectroscopy represents the solid state interface layered resistance and the surface charge transfer resistance. The smaller radius of the EIS Nyquist plot demonstrates the lower impedance and a higher efficiency of charge transfer.40 As shown in Fig. 12, the Nyquist plot diameter of BMO/PANI1.00% is significantly decreased in comparison with those of PANI and Bi2MoO6. These results imply an effective separation of photogenerated charge carriers and fast interfacial charge transfer between PANI and Bi2MoO6, agreeing well with the photocurrent responses.

3.3. Photocatalytic performances
The photocatalytic performances of different samples were investigated by comparing the photodegradation efficiency of RhB under identical conditions. Fig. 13 displays the changes in RhB relative concentration (C/C0) as a function of irradiation time over the BMO/PANI composites with various PANI loadings. For comparison, a blank experiment was performed, and it was shown that the photolysis of RhB in the absence of photocatalysts was extremely slow. For the pristine Bi2MoO6, 48% of RhB is degraded after 105 min irradiation. The content of PANI has a significant effect on the photocatalytic activity of the BMO/PANI materials. It can be found that the BMO/PANI1.00% composite exhibits the highest activity, which is much better than that of pure Bi2MoO6, as well as the hybrid materials with other PANI loadings. For comparative purposes, the photocatalytic performances of TiO2 and g-C3N4 for the photocatalytic degradation of RhB aqueous solutions are also provided in the ESI,† Fig. S4. As expected, the BMO/PANI1.00% composite exhibits higher photocatalytic activities when compared to TiO2 and g-C3N4. It is interesting to note that when the PANI content is larger than 1.00%, the photocatalytic activity is decreased obviously, indicating that the optimal PANI mass ratio in the BMO/PANI composites is 1.00%. Although the introduction of PANI favored the charge separation, too much PANI dispersed on the surface of Bi2MoO6 would shield the Bi2MoO6 from absorbing light.32,41 The lower light harvesting could reduce the generation of electron–hole pairs, resulting in a decreased photocatalytic activity. The results suggest that the proper introduction of PANI is beneficial for the improvement of the photocatalytic activity of BMO/PANI composites. The reusability of BMO/PANI1.00% was evaluated based on recycling experiments. As shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†), no apparent deactivation of the photocatalysts is observed after five successive cycles, indicating the high stability of BMO/PANI1.00%.
 Fig. 13  Comparison of photocatalytic performances of the as-prepared samples for the photocatalytic degradation of RhB aqueous solutions. 
To quantitatively understand the reaction kinetics of the RhB degradation, the degradation data were analyzed by the pseudo-first-order model (Fig. S6 in the ESI†), ln(C0/C) = kt, where k is the apparent pseudo-first-order rate constant, C is the concentration of RhB in aqueous solution at time t, and C0 is the original concentration of RhB.42 It can be seen that the loading content of PANI had a great effect on the photodegradation rate constant (k). The apparent rate constant (k) of BMO/PANI1.00% is determined to be 0.02492 min−1, which is about 3.8 times as high as that of pure Bi2MoO6 (0.00662 min−1). In addition, as the loading content of Bi2MoO6 further increases, the photodegradation rate constant (k) gradually decreases. This result suggests that the PANI loading amount in the BMO/PANI composites plays an important role in the photocatalytic performance. In fact, the optimum content of PANI in the BMO/PANI composites can be closely related to the recombination rate of photogenerated charge carriers. It has been reported that there is a suitable value of the space charge region potential for the efficient separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs.16,43Fig. 14 displays the temporal changes of TOC during the degradation of RhB. In the photocatalytic system, the TOC removal is slower than the degradation of RhB. After about 105 min, the removal efficiency of RhB reached about 97% while the mineralization degree was only 81%. The TOC measurements demonstrated that complete mineralization (conversion of all carbon atoms to CO or CO2) could not be achieved, although a complete decolorization occurred in 60 min for BMO/PANI1.00%. This meant that some organic compounds still remained when the chromophores were completely broken.44

It is generally accepted that the photocatalytic process is induced by the photogenerated electron–hole pairs.45 Thus, it is necessary to indentify the main active species generated in the system for investigating the photocatalytic mechanisms. To investigate the effect of the active species on the photocatalytic process, trapping experiments for detecting the active species were performed during the photocatalytic reaction. Scavengers including TBA for hydroxyl radicals (˙OH), BQ for superoxide radicals (˙O2−), and EDTA for photogenerated holes (h+) have been, respectively, added to the degradation system. As shown in Fig. 15, the addition of TBA has little effect on the photocatalytic efficiency, while the photodegradation of RhB is obviously inhibited by the addition of BQ and EDTA. This demonstrates that the superoxide radicals (˙O2−) and photogenerated holes (h+) rather than hydroxyl radicals (˙OH) are the main active species, and play an important role in the photodegradation process. Moreover, the reduction speed of the photocatalytic performance upon addition of EDTA is faster than that upon addition of BQ, indicating that the photogenerated holes (h+) play a more important role than those of the superoxide radicals (˙O2−) in the RhB degradation process. These can be further confirmed by the band structure of BMO/PANI1.00%. After the introduction of PANI, the VB and CB values of Bi2MoO6 were determined to be 1.54 and −0.91 eV, respectively. The VB value (1.54 eV) is less positive than those of E0(˙OH /OH−) (2.38 eV vs. NHE) and E0(˙OH /H2O) (2.72 eV vs. NHE), suggesting that the adsorbed OH− and H2O cannot be oxidized to generate hydroxyl radicals (˙OH).46,47 Whereas, the photogenerated electrons in the CB minimum (−0.91 eV) are enough to reduce O2 to yield ˙O2− due to the E0(O2/˙O2−) being only about −0.046 eV.48 These analyses are consistent with the results of active species trapping experiments.

On the basis of the above discussion, the enhancement of photocatalytic performance was mainly attributed to the high efficiency of charge separation induced by the synergistic effect between Bi2MoO6 and PANI. A possible mechanism for the enhancement of photocatalytic properties of BMO/PANI composites is proposed in Fig. 16. As a semiconductor material, PANI could absorb light to induce electron π–π* transition, and the electrons can be excited from the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of PANI.25,49 The π* and π orbital edge potentials are determined to be −2.14 and 0.62 eV versus NHE, respectively.20 Under light irradiation, both PANI and Bi2MoO6 can be excited (Fig. 13). The VB edge potential of Bi2MoO6 (1.38 eV) is more positive than that of the π orbital edge potential of PANI (0.62 eV), and the π* orbital edge potential of PANI (−2.14 eV) is more negative than that of the CB of Bi2MoO6 (−1.20 eV). Accordingly, the photoinduced electrons on the surface of PANI can transfer easily to the CB of Bi2MoO6, leaving the holes on the HOMO orbital of PANI. Meanwhile, the photogenerated holes in the VB of Bi2MoO6 were injected into the HOMO orbital of PANI. Thus, more and more photogenerated electrons and holes were formed in the composites. Then, the photogenerated electrons are trapped by the O2 near the surface of the composites to form reactive superoxide radicals (˙O2−), and the holes (h+) can directly oxidize the pollutants because the hydroxyl radicals (˙OH) are not the main active species in the photocatalytic process of RhB. Therefore, there is efficient separation of photoinduced electrons and holes on the heterojunction, which may bring about rapid charge carrier separation and slow charge carrier recombination, resulting in enhanced photocatalytic properties.

3.4. Nonlinear optical properties
The efficient charge transfer and separation efficiency suggests that the composites are candidates for nonlinear optical applications, and have potential for protecting the human eye and in optical sensors from high power laser pulses, and also have potential in optical switching and other areas.50–52 To assess this possibility, Z-scan experiments employing linearly polarized 4 ns laser pulses at 532 nm have been carried out on these composites dispersed in DMSO. For ease of comparison, all sample concentrations were adjusted to be 0.15 mg mL−1. The open aperture Z-scan method was employed to investigate the nonlinear optical absorption performances of the as-prepared samples in the nanosecond regime. The open aperture Z-scan measures the transmittance of the sample as it translates through the focal point of the laser pulses. The sample experiences maximum laser light intensity at the focal point, and the intensity decreases on moving away from the focal point. As the sample is brought closer to the focal point, the nonlinear performance becomes measurable, leading to a decreasing or increasing transmittance due to different nonlinear mechanisms.

Fig. 17 displays the typical open aperture Z-scan curves of the as-prepared samples. DMSO solvent in a 1 mm cuvette was also measured and no nonlinear absorption response was observed (Fig. S7 in the ESI†), which excludes the effects of DMSO and the 1 mm cuvette. As shown in Fig. 17a, Bi2MoO6, PANI, BMO/PANI1.00%, and BMO/PANI1.25% exhibit a decrease in transmittance at the focus, typical of an induced positive nonlinear optical absorption, i.e. reverse saturable absorption of incident light, implying clear optical limiting;53,54 a property that is applicable in the protection of optical sensors. For an optical limiter, the depth of the valley in the open aperture Z-scan is consistent with the extent of nonlinear optical performance.55,56 The largest decrease in the transmittance value is observed for BMO/PANI1.00%, indicating that it should have the best optical limiting performance. The normalized transmittance of BMO/PANI1.00% at the focus, where the incident light is a maximum, dropped to 67% of the input fluence, identical within experimental error to the decrease to 66% for a previously reported graphene hybrid functionalized by zinc phthalocyanine,57 although the differing experimental geometries render such a comparison necessarily cautious. Comparing the nonlinear absorption performance of BMO/PANI1.00% and the graphene oxide nanohybrid covalently functionalized with polyaniline in ref. 10, it is seen that the BMO/PANI1.00% nanocomposite exhibits a weaker nonlinear absorption response. However, different phenomena are believed to be responsible for the observed nonlinear optical behaviors, rendering further comment unwarranted. Interestingly, different nonlinear optical absorption responses were observed for BMO/PANI0.70%, BMO/PANI0.90%, BMO/PANI1.75%, and BMO/PANI2.00%, the results being shown in Fig. 17b. For BMO/PANI1.75% and BMO/PANI2.00%, the normalized transmittance increased as the samples were brought closer to the focal point, which is in contrast to an optical limiting performance, and indicative of saturable absorption responses.58 In general, a saturable absorption effect arises when the generation rate of excited states is equal to their depletion rate by stimulated emission and excited relaxation.59 Thus, both composites can effectively suppress low intensity laser pulses but allow higher intensity laser pulses to pass. The stronger saturable absorption performance for BMO/PANI2.00% compared to BMO/PANI1.75% may be due to the various chemical compositions, consistent with the nonlinear optical performances of Ag-stabilized few-layer graphene dispersions.60 The normalized transmittance curve of BMO/PANI0.90% shows two weaker shoulder peaks along with a valley, corresponding to a transformation from saturable absorption to reverse saturable absorption as the sample moves to the focal point of a lens. Indeed, it can be clearly seen that the nonlinear optical absorption response of BMO/PANI0.90% for ns pulses at 532 nm results from a combination of saturable absorption and free carrier absorption at low incident light intensity, and the saturable absorption plays the major role, while the reverse saturable absorption and nonlinear scattering have significant influences on the optical nonlinearity at high excitation energy densities.60–62 Similar results were also observed with the BMO/PANI0.70% composite upon excitation at 532 nm with 4 ns pulses, although the nonlinear optical absorption response is inferior to that of BMO/PANI0.90%. The present study indicates that there is an optimum concentration of PANI in the composites for nonlinear optical performances, specifically composition BMO/PANI1.00%, which has the strongest reverse saturable absorption response. Similar phenomena have been observed with multiwalled carbon nanotube-organically modified silicate nanohybrid gel glass (MWCNTs–ORMOSIL);63 the ORMOSIL content has a significant influence on the nonlinear absorption performance of MWCNTs–ORMOSIL nanohybrids. The improved nonlinear optical absorption response can have contributions from various mechanisms, such as free carrier absorption, two photon absorption, reverse saturable absorption, etc.64,65 As Bi2MoO6 is a semiconductor, the free carrier absorption may take place under laser excitation, making the electron transfer from the VB to CB.13 While in the case of PANI, under 532 nm laser irradiation the electron may move to the excited state involving π–π* transition by observing reverse saturable absorption and/or two photon absorption.66 The effective interfacial charge carrier transfer between Bi2MoO6 and PANI also has a significant effect on the enhanced optical nonlinearity of the composites compared to the individual components,12,67,68 which has been confirmed by the results of fluorescence, photocurrent response and EIS experiments.
 Fig. 17  Open aperture Z-scan curves of the as-prepared samples in DMSO, obtained under 4 ns, 532 laser excitation. 
The concentration-dependent nonlinear optical response indicates that PANI doped-Bi2MoO6 holds promise for various potential applications. For example, the BMO/PANI1.75% and BMO/PANI2.00% composites are better candidates for saturable absorber applications such as pulse shaping or as shutters in ns systems, while the nonlinear optical mechanism changing from saturable absorption to reverse saturable absorption and back to saturable absorption as a function of incident light intensity for BMO/PANI0.70% and BMO/PANI0.90% suggests that they can be potential candidates for ultrafast nonlinear optical switching applications. In particular, the significant nonlinear optical absorption performance of BMO/PANI1.00% and BMO/PANI1.25% may lead to optical limiting applications in human eyes and optical sensor protection. In addition, the nonlinear refractive components were assessed by dividing the normalized Z-scan data obtained from the closed aperture configuration, the results being shown in Fig. 18. Similar to open aperture experiments, a concentration-dependent nonlinear refraction performance was also observed for the composites. The pure Bi2MoO6, BMO/PANI0.90% and BMO/PANI1.00% were found to exhibit a peak-valley transmission configuration, indicative of negative nonlinear refraction, and corresponding to a self-defocusing performance.69 In contrast, PANI and BMO/PANI0.70% exhibited a valley-peak transmission configuration under visible excitation, indicating positive nonlinear refraction and corresponding to a self-focusing performance.70 However, no obvious nonlinear refraction response was observed for other composites, i.e. BMO/PANI1.25%, BMO/PANI1.75%, and BMO/PANI2.00%. It should also be noted that in Fig. 18 the differences between the normalized transmittance values and valley positions for the as-prepared composites are smaller than that of Bi2MoO6 in this study, presumably a result of the introduction of PANI, which is in contrast to the results of open aperture Z-scan and is not as expected. The detailed mechanism needs further investigation, but the current work demonstrates that the nonlinear optical response of the composites is a sensitive function of a combination of the nonlinear optical mechanisms operative with Bi2MoO6 and PANI.

4. Conclusions
In summary, we have reported the facile synthesis and structural, spectroscopic, photocatalytic and nonlinear optical properties of BMO/PANI composites. The formation of the composites was confirmed by FTIR, XRD, Raman, SEM, TEM and XPS spectroscopies. The wide absorption of the samples in the visible light region makes them suitable for nonlinear transmission and photocatalytic activity studies. The present study indicates that there is an optimum concentration of PANI in the composites to maximize the photocatalysis and optical nonlinearity; the BMO/PANI1.00% composite exhibits an increased nonlinear optical absorption performance in the nanosecond regime, while intensity-dependent behavior in BMO/PANI0.70% and BMO/PANI0.90% is observed. The heterojunction interface formed between Bi2MoO6 and PANI improves the transport and separation of the photogenerated charges due to the strong interfacial interactions, which prove to be a key factor for enhanced photocatalytic activity and nonlinear optical properties. The improved optical nonlinearity is believed to arise from the synergetic combination of mechanisms, and the photoinduced charge transfer within the composites. Overall, these results indicate that BMO/PANI composites with an appropriate content of PANI afford good candidates for photocatalysis, optical limiting, nonlinear optical switching, and solar-energy conversion, and potentially attractive possibilities for novel nanoscale stable materials for photonic and optoelectronic devices.
