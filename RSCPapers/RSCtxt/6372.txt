    , Accepted 3rd March 2019First published on 4th March 2019Abstractvan der Waals (vdW) heterostructures, achieved by binding various two-dimensional (2D) materials together via vdW interaction, expand the family of 2D materials and show fascinating possibilities. In this work, we have systematically investigated the geometrical structures, electronic structures, and optical properties of III–VI (MX, M = Ga, In and X = S, Se, Te) vdW heterostructures and their corresponding applications in sustainable energy related areas based on first principles calculations. It is highlighted that different heterostructure types can be achieved in spite of the similar electronic structures of MX monolayers. Meanwhile, the potential applications of the heterostructures for sustainable energy related areas have been further unraveled. For instance, type-II InS/GaSe and GaS/GaSe vdW heterostructures can separately produce hydrogen and oxygen at the opposite parts. On the other hand, a type-II GaSe/GaTe heterostructure with a direct band gap compatible with silicon has been proposed to be a potential solar cell material with a power conversion efficiency over 18%. Furthermore, a gapless type-IV semi-metallic InTe/GaS heterostructure has been predicted to be a Li-ion battery anode material based on three-step lithiated analysis. The present results will shed light on the sustainable energy applications of such remarkable artificial MX vdW heterostructures in the future.
1. Introduction
The idea of forming the so-called van der Waals (vdW) heterostructure by vertically binding two different atomically thin two-dimensional (2D) materials together via the interlayer vdW interaction1–3 has not only resulted in the explosive expansion of the family of 2D materials4 but also opened up more possibilities in the applications of sustainable energy related areas.5–7 In particular, semiconducting type-II heterostructures have been widely investigated in solar energy related areas like photovoltaic solar cells and visible light photocatalytic water splitting with their fascinating electronic structures and optical properties.8–10 In type-II heterostructures, the conduction band minimum (CBM) and valence band maximum (VBM) are located in different layers. Hence, photo-generated electrons and holes are spatially separated from each other in different layers, which may reduce the electron–hole recombination probability and is beneficial for the migration and separation of photo-generated electron–hole pairs for photoenergy harvesting.11,12 The lifetime of the indirect excitons in type-II heterostructures was observed to be longer than that of the direct ones in individual layers from a recent experiment measurement.13 On the other hand, metallic type-III heterostructures offer enhanced electrical conductivity compared to the isolated 2D precursors as well as their mechanical flexible nature and have been proposed as potential flexible electrode materials.7,14 The huge surface area to weight ratio associated with the large void space in the vdW gap facilitates their promising applications as anode materials for Li-ion batteries.15,16
Recently, monolayer InSe, a typical member of the family of 2D III–VI monolayers, has been successfully fabricated via employing exfoliation and subsequent encapsulation of few-layered InSe under an inert atmosphere.17 It is interesting to note that the strongly suppressed recombination of the electron–hole pairs has been experimentally confirmed in the 2D InSe monolayer, which is beneficial for the charge separation and transportation during the photocatalysis process.17 However, monolayer InSe shows an indirect band gap with a typical saddle type valence band, which is distinct from the direct band gap nature of its bulk form.18–20 Although the external electric field can tune the indirect band gap of InSe into the metallic type,21 the electric field-induced near free-electron gas can't modulate its valence band feature and transform the band gap type to direct.22 It is worth noting that other 2D III–VI (MX, M = Ga, In and X = S, Se, Te) monolayers show very similar indirect band gap features to InSe monolayers,23 where phonons are needed to mediate electronic excitation from light.24 Hence, this drawback limits their further application in the areas of MX monolayers in the next generation high efficiency photoenergy conversion. To solve this issue, an indirect to direct band gap transition has been proposed in special Se0.5GaS0.5/As and S0.5GaSe0.5/As vdW heterostructures recently,25 which shows the possibility to achieve direct band gaps in MX monolayer-based vdW heterostructures. However, the Janus Se0.5GaS0.5 or S0.5GaSe0.5 structures are hard to achieve with their asymmetric atomic arrangements. On the other hand, both indirect to direct band gap transition and semiconductor to metal transition by strain engineering in InSe/MoS2 vdW heterostructures have been theoretically proposed.26 Nevertheless, exploration of the primitive direct band gap feature in MX monolayers and related vdW heterostructures is still ongoing. It is worth noting that the MX monolayers share the same honeycomb hexagonal 2D lattice, which makes it feasible to fabricate vdW heterostructures with each other.27,28 More importantly, the lattice mismatch between different MX monolayers and the interlayer vdW interactions are both powerful tools for the tuning of the electronic structures.29–31 Therefore, the fabrication and understanding of vdW heterostructures using only the MX monolayers are anticipated and of great interest and importance.
In this work, we have performed a systematic computational screening of 2D group III–VI (MX, M = Ga, In and X = S, Se, Te) vdW heterostructures based on density functional theory. We first determined the most stable stacking modes of MX heterostructures and confirmed the corresponding stability. From the analysis of electronic structures and properties, the potential applications of the MX vdW heterostructures in water splitting photocatalysts, photovoltaic solar cells and Li-ion battery anodes have been proposed. This study provides a general approach for the analysis of the MX vdW heterostructures, which will shed light on their applications in sustainable energy related areas.
2. Computational methods
Our calculations in this paper were performed using the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP) based on density functional theory (DFT) in conjunction with the projection-augmented-wave (PAW) potential.32,33 The exchange and correlation potentials were described by using the version of the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof34 (PBE). The optB86b-vdW functional35 corrected method was used for the improved description of the vdW interactions. The DFT-D2 approach of Grimme36 was also included for double checking. A 7 × 7 × 1 Γ-centered k-mesh was used for structure optimizations, and a 15 × 15 × 1 Γ-centered k-mesh was used for property determination. A cutoff energy of 500 eV was determined by total energy convergence tests, which have been shown in Fig. S1.† We build a vacuum space of 20 Å along the z-direction to avoid the interactions of periodic structures. The relaxation convergence for both electrons and ions was 1 × 10−5 eV and 1 × 10−6 eV, respectively. The Phonopy37 code was employed to obtain the phonon dispersion curves through the supercell approach,38 for which a 4 × 4 × 1 supercell with a Γ k-point and 1 × 10−8 eV relaxation convergence for electrons were employed. Ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations with a canonical ensemble (NVT) Nose–Hoover thermostat39,40 were performed at 300 K to access the thermal stabilities.41 We used VESTA42 to visualize the crystal structures of the vdW heterostructures. We also included the Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof (HSE06)43 hybrid functional to give better electronic structure pictures for the vdW heterostructures.44 To obtain accurate dielectric functions comparable to the experimental results, time-dependent Hartree–Fock calculation (TDHF)45 was introduced to calculate the response functions by including the excitonic effects based on the HSE06 wavefunctions.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Geometry and stability
The 2D MX monolayers (M = Ga, In and X = S, Se, Te, shown in Fig. 1(a)) share a honeycomb hexagonal structure with the space group of P63/mmc,23 as is illustrated in Fig. 1(b). Table S1† lists the lattice constants and bond lengths of the MX monolayers after optimization using PBE, optB86-vdW, DFT-D2 functionals. Our calculated results are in very good agreement with the published literature studies.18,28 As seen in Table S1,† the differences of the lattice constants between most of the MX monolayers are in a reasonable range. For example, the lattice mismatch between InSe and GaTe and InS and GaSe is only 1.51% and 2.61% using the optB86-vdW functional, respectively. The good lattice match is beneficial for the construction of particular vdW heterostructures, as shown in Fig. 1(c). Since the vdW interaction plays a vital role in the 2D heterostructure systems, the vdW corrected functional must be included. In the following, we mainly presented and analyzed the optB86-vdW results.

There are five possible stacking configurations for MX (M1X1/M2X2, M1X1 as the top layer, M2X2 as the bottom layer) heterostructures, which is similar to bilayer InSe.22 As is illustrated in Fig. S2,† stacking I follows the MX bulk configurations,46 where the X1 atoms of the upper layer lie on top of the M2 atoms of the bottom layer. Furthermore, the transition from stacking I to II and III is the movement related to the shifting of the upper M1X1 monolayer along the [110] direction of 1/3 and 2/3 a, respectively. On the other hand, we can obtain stacking IV by rotating the upper layer of stacking I around the z axis with an angle of 180°. Moreover, the transition from stacking IV to V is the movement related to the shifting of the upper M1X1 monolayer along the [110] direction of 1/3 a. Further shifting of the upper M1X1 monolayer along the [110] direction of 2/3 a will achieve the same configuration of stacking V with a central mirror symmetry.22 After full optimization of the energy and force for all the stacking configurations of all the possible 15 MX heterostructures, we can determine the most stable configuration for each heterostructure according to the energy difference ΔE using the following equation: ΔEi = Ei − E0(1)where E0 is the total energy of the most stable configuration with the most negative total energy, and Ei is the total energy of each configuration. Herein, the calculated ΔE by using the optB86-vdW functional according to the data in Table S2† are summed up in Table 1. Interestingly, stacking III is the most stable stacking for most of the MX heterostructures. The only exception is the InS/GaSe heterostructure, where the total energy of stacking V is 0.41 eV lower than stacking III. To achieve a better understanding of the stacking configurations for the MX heterostructures, we have further listed the lattice parameter, the interlayer distance, the bond length, the band gap and the energy difference for InSe/GaTe and InS/GaSe heterostructures with stacking I–V using optB86-vdw, PBE and DFT-D2 functionals in Tables S3, S4 and S5,† respectively. Firstly, we can confirm that PBE and DFT-D2 follow the same energetic stacking stability to optB86-vdW. Secondly, similar to bilayer InSe,22 the MX heterostructures with different stacking configurations can be divided into two groups according to the interlayer distance as well. The first group (referred to as Group-S) has smaller interlayer distances, including stacking I, III, and V. The second group (referred to as Group-L) shows larger interlayer distances, including stacking II and IV. Herein, the calculated parameters of the same group are very similar. Obviously, Group-S is more energetically favorable with a smaller ΔE than Group-L. Hence, the stacking configurations in Group-S could be the possible stacking for the MX heterostructures. This explains why the result of the most stable configuration for the InS/GaSe heterostructure as stacking V is reasonable.

To further investigate the stability of the MX heterostructures, we calculated the formation energy corresponding to the most stable stacking according to the following equation:8 (2)where  is the total energy of the MX heterostructure. And  and  represent the total energy of pristine M1X1 and M2X2 monolayers, respectively. The calculated results according to the data in Table S6† are listed in Table 2. The results from DFT-D2 are also listed in Table S7† for reference. It is interesting to note that the negative values or small positive values less than 1 eV of the formation energy of the MX heterostructures indicate that the formation of such heterostructures is energetically favorable. It is worth noting that the formation energy is directly related to the lattice constant difference Δa between the corresponding monolayers, which is also listed in Table 2. We further summarized the calculated formation energy vs. lattice constant difference plots in Fig. 2. It is interesting to find that the formation energy of the heterostructures can be well described as a function of the lattice constant difference by quadratic polynomial fittings. Herein, the GaSe/GaTe heterostructure is the only exception. According to the fitting plots, we can further conclude that the lattice constant difference of 0.3 Å or 8% is the upper limit to achieve the negative formation energy for MX heterostructures.

To further confirm the stability of the MX heterostructures, we have performed phonon calculations to explore the lattice dynamic stabilities and ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations to assess the thermal stabilities. Herein, we take a GaSe/GaTe heterostructure as an example, which shows unexpected large formation energy. Fig. 3(a) illustrates the phonon dispersion curves for the GaSe/GaTe heterostructure. Obviously, there is no negative frequency observed, suggesting that the GaSe/GaTe heterostructure lattice is dynamically stable. Fig. 3(b) presents the energy evolution of the GaSe/GaTe heterostructure at a temperature of 300 K for 9 ps. The thermal stability is consistently confirmed by the time dependent evolution of total energy, which is fluctuating in a narrow range. It is clearly seen from the structure snapshots before and after annealing that the ions are displacing near their equilibrium positions during the simulations and no structural reconstruction occurs at 300 K temperature. Fig. S3† shows the phonon dispersion curves and AIMD results for some other MX heterostructures, which leads to the same conclusions for the GaSe/GaTe heterostructure. Hence both the phonon calculations and AIMD simulations confirm the dynamic stabilities of the MX heterostructures.47

Moreover, the binding energy between the corresponding MX monolayers was introduced to assess the strength of the vdW interaction force in the heterostructures, which can be defined according to the following equation: (3)where  listed in Table S6† is the accumulation of the total energy of mutually independent M1X1 and M2X2 monolayers which were fixed in the corresponding heterostructure lattice. According to the calculated binding energy listed in Table 2, all the binding energy values are within the range of a typical vdW binding energy of around 20 meV obtained by advanced DFT calculations.8,48 The corresponding results from DFT-D2 are also listed in Table S7† for reference. Hence, the MX heterostructures belong to the family of vdW heterostructures.
3.2 Electronic properties
For a better understanding of the electronic structures of the MX vdW heterostructures, we started with the initial screening of the band structure of the monolayers. The projected band structures of the MX monolayers using the HSE06 hybrid functional based on the optB86-vdW functional are illustrated in Fig. S4.† The results indicate that the MX monolayers are indirect band gap semiconductors with the HSE06 band gaps of 2.50, 2.47, 2.34, 3.35, 2.66, and 2.22 eV for InS, InSe, InTe, GaS, GaSe and GaTe, respectively. The results agree well with the previously published studies.18,28 Herein, for InS, InSe, InTe, GaS and GaSe monolayers, the conduction band minimum (CBM) locates at the Γ point and is contributed by the hybridization of the M s and X p electrons, where the valence band maximum (VBM) locates between the Γ–K high symmetry line and is occupied by the hybridization of the M p and X p electrons. For GaTe monolayers, the VBM follows the other MX monolayers as well, but due to the strong hybridization of the Ga s electrons and Te p electrons, the CBM of GaTe is located at the M point. Fig. 4(a) presents the band edge alignments of the MX monolayers. It is interesting to find that the CBMs and VBMs of different MX monolayers are located at different energy levels. Hence, different holes and/or electron properties in the different layer of the heterostructure are anticipated by the construction of MX vdW heterostructures.9

(c) Band edge alignments of the MX vdW heterostructures, where blue, orange, and yellow represent the suitable electronic structure feature in photocatalysis, solar energy, and lithium-ion battery applications, respectively. The black dashed lines in (a) and (c) illustrate the hydrogen reduction potential (H+/H2) and water oxidation potential (H2O/O2). 

Fig. 4(b) illustrates the typical heterostructure types classified by the band edge alignments:49 in a type-I straddling heterostructure, the CBM and VBM are in the same layer; in a type-II staggered heterostructure, the CBM and VBM exist in different layers; while in a type-III broken-gap heterostructure, there is no band gap anymore due to the crossing of valence bands and conduction bands.50Fig. 4(c) shows the HSE06 calculated band edge alignments of the MX vdW heterostructures. It is worth noting that most (10 of 15) of the MX vdW heterostructures are type-II staggered heterostructures, which are highly desirable photocatalytic and photovoltaic candidates. On the other hand, we can achieve 4 type-I straddling heterostructures in the MX vdW heterostructures as well, as shown in Fig. 4(c). Herein, the suitable band gap values and band edge alignments of InS/GaSe, InSe/GaSe, InS/GaS and GaS/GaSe heterostructures well straddle the water redox potentials, suggesting that these heterostructures are potential photocatalysts for visible light water splitting (marked blue in Fig. 4(c)).51,52 Besides, eligible direct band gap values close to the silicon (∼1.16 eV) of InS/GaTe and GaSe/GaTe heterostructures show potential applications in solar cells (marked orange in Fig. 4(c)).53,54 Moreover, it is worth noting that the InTe/GaS heterostructure presents a novel gapless semi-metallic electronic structure feature, which is different from the type-III broken-gap heterostructure. The InTe/GaS heterostructure can be classified as a novel type-IV semi-metallic heterostructure, where the corresponding schematic figure has been added to Fig. 4(b). More details of the electronic structures of the type-IV InTe/GaS heterostructure will be shown in the following band structure analysis part. Herein, the gapless semi-metallic feature of the InTe/GaS heterostructure provides an intrinsic advantage in its application in lithium-ion batteries (marked yellow in Fig. 4(c)).55,56
Before going further to the applications of the MX vdW heterostructures in sustainable energy related areas, we firstly unraveled the band structures of the MX vdW heterostructures to improve the understanding of their electronic structure features. The HSE06 band structures of the vdW heterostructures projected to the different layers are illustrated in Fig. 5. Herein, the M1X1/M2X2 heterostructure denotes that the M1X1 monolayer is the upper layer and the M2X2 monolayer is the bottom layer. The corresponding HSE06 band structures projected to different atoms are represented in Fig. S5† for further references as well. As seen from Fig. S5,† the CBM and VBM mainly originated from the X (S, Se, Te) atoms, where X with a larger atomic number prefers to occupy the VBM and X with a smaller atomic number prefers to contribute to the CBM. Except for the zero-gap semi-metallic InTe/GaS heterostructure, the CBM of all the other MX vdW heterostructures is located at the Γ point. Interestingly, the VBM of the InS/GaTe, InTe/GaSe, InS/InTe, GaS/GaTe, GaSe/GaTe heterostructures is also located at the Γ point. Hence we achieved five direct gap heterostructures herein. It is worth noting that the VBM and CBM of the InTe/GaS heterostructure touch each other at the Γ point as well to show its gapless type-IV semi-metallic feature. However, none of the MX monolayers has the Γ point VBM nature as we have already presented in Fig. S4.† It is well known that both the lattice mismatch induced intra-plane strain and vdW interaction could influence the band structures of a 2D material. To clarify how the lattice mismatch induced intra-plane strain works on the electronic structures of the MX vdW heterostructures, we have plotted the band structures of mutually independent monolayers fixed in the corresponding heterostructure lattice by neglecting the vdW interaction between the monolayers shown in Fig. S6.† The lattice strains ε for the MX monolayers fixed in the corresponding heterostructure lattice for MX heterostructures are listed in Table S8† as well. We can conclude that the lattice mismatch induced intra-plane strain can effectively affect the band structure of MX monolayers, however, it is not the only key determining factor. The vdW interaction between two monolayers plays a vital role in the electronic structure of the vdW heterostructure as well. Taking the semi-metallic InTe/GaS heterostructure as an example, without the vdW interaction between the InTe and GaS monolayers, the lattice mismatch shifts the VBM of the InTe monolayer to the Γ point. Notwithstanding, there is an ∼0.8 eV band gap between the VBM of InTe and the CBM of GaS as seen from Fig. S6(e).† By comparing the calculated band gap values in Fig. 5 and Fig. S6,† we can say that the vdW interaction can systematically reduce the band gap of the vdW heterostructures.

The size of azure and pink circles illustrates the projected weight of contribution from the upper and bottom layer. 
To further explore the exciton effect in the vdW heterostructures, we have estimated the exciton binding energy, inferred from the difference between the HSE06 band gaps and the HSE06-TDHF optical gaps. Table 3 lists the predicted HSE06 band gaps, TDHF optical gaps and the exciton binding energies according to Eexcitonb = EHSE06g − ETDHFg. It is shown that in the case of the semiconducting MX vdW heterostructures, the exciton binding energies were predicted to be in the range of 0.07 to 0.65 eV, which are comparable to those of monolayer MX23 or MoS2.57,58 Such small exciton binding energy facilitates the splitting of excitons into free charge carriers, which indicates that the semiconducting MX vdW heterostructures could exhibit excellent energy conversion efficiency under solar light irradiation.

In addition, we have investigated the dielectric properties to evaluate the application potential of MX vdW heterostructures. Since the dielectric properties from plane-wave density functional and pseudopotential methods for 2D systems depend on the vacuum geometry, the calculated results need to be normalized as a function of the vacuum layer thickness.22 To solve this issue, we adopt the normalized slab polarizability α, which defines the relationship between the electric field and the induced dipole moment, which is estimated as59 (4)where Ω is the volume of the cell and ε is the dielectric constant. Table S9† lists the calculated dielectric constant ε, cell volume Ω and normalized slab polarizability α for MX vdW heterostructures in different directions. It is worth noting that the intra-plane slab polarizability αx is about two times the inter-plane slab polarizability αz. Hence the MX vdW heterostructures are expected to be applied along the 2D plane.
In the following, we will further explore the applications of the MX vdW heterostructures in sustainable energy related areas, especially in photocatalysts, solar cells and lithium-ion batteries.
3.3 Photocatalytic applications
The primary requirement for a suitable photocatalyst is a suitable band gap for effective sunlight harvesting and favorable band edge alignments, where the CBM should be higher than the hydrogen reduction potential (H+/H2) and the VBM should be lower than the water oxidation potential (H2O/O2).60 Based on the above criteria, we have marked InS/GaSe, InSe/GaSe, InS/GaS and GaS/GaSe heterostructures as potential photocatalysts for visible light water splitting as shown in Fig. 4(c). The positions of band edges crossed over the water redox potentials of the vdW heterostructures are in favor of the oxidation and reduction of water. Moreover, to better understand the charge transfer and the potential profile between two adjacent layers, the plane averaged electron density difference and the plane averaged electronic potential are illustrated in Fig. S7.† Obviously, a significant charge redistribution can be seen in the vdW gap of two conjunction monolayers. The charge transfer pictures of the InS/GaSe and GaS/GaSe heterostructures in Fig. S7(a) and (d)† show that the electrons move from the GaSe side to the other side across the vdW gap and the holes move to the GaSe side. As a result, the electrons are mainly localized around the positions of the S atoms, and the vdW heterostructures present the type-II heterostructure nature. While in the InSe/GaSe and InS/GaS heterostructures, the electrons and holes are broadly localized around the S atoms of both sides of the heterostructures, presenting the type-I heterostructure nature. Nevertheless, for both cases, a build-in electric field emerged as a result of charge transfer and it could generate a driving force for the separation of the photo-generated electron–hole pairs.61 In addition, from the static potential profile of the four heterostructures in Fig. S7,† the work functions of the InS/GaSe, InSe/GaSe, InS/GaS, and GaS/GaSe heterostructures were predicted to be 5.28, 5.05, 5.29 and 5.30 eV, respectively. Correspondingly, the potential drops ΔV are 2.19, 1.60, 1.52, and 3.80 eV, respectively, which indicate strong built-in electrical fields bring to the efficiency promotion of the photo-generated carriers.62
The exciting optical responses of these four heterostructures were explored based on HSE06-TDHF absorption coefficients, as shown in Fig. 6. As compared to the standard DFT-HSE06 results in Fig. S8,† TDHF simulations provided us more accurate optical responses with energy distinguished peaks. It is interesting to find that in Fig. S9,† the TDHF results show very similar optical absorption patterns to the G0W0 approximation63 with distinguishable excitonic peaks as well. It is seen that the vdW heterostructures show substantial adsorption under both visible light and UV light, which is comparable to the corresponding monolayers as well as the MoS2 monolayer.64 Since the large absorption coefficients of the MX monolayers guarantee high photocatalytic efficiency in terms of utilization of solar energy,23 the highly efficient utilization of solar energy for photocatalytic water splitting of the vdW heterostructures is expected. On the other hand, thanks to the reduction of the band gaps, a red shift of the first absorption peak can be found by forming the vdW heterostructure, as is marked in Fig. 6. Such a phenomenon is beneficial for the more effective utilization of visible light energy from solar radiation, which is similar to the MoS2/AlN(GaN) heterostructures.8,65 Moreover, the advantage of the vdW heterostructures over MX monolayers is obvious. For instance, according to the type-II band structure nature, the InS/GaSe and GaS/GaSe vdW heterostructures not only have significantly improved photocatalysis properties but can also separately produce hydrogen and oxygen at the opposite parts of the vdW heterostructures, which is the most desirable photocatalysis performance in practice.

The whole water splitting reaction occurring at the surface of the photocatalysts derives from the participation of water with surface hydroxyl radicals, which started from the surface adsorption of the water molecules.66 Therefore, to unravel the mechanism of water decomposition at the vdW heterostructure surface, we firstly calculated the adsorption energy of water molecules  at different monolayer surfaces according to the following equation67 by taking the InS/GaSe heterostructure as an example: (5)where  is the total energy of absorption configuration,  and Esurfacetot are the total energies of an individual water molecule and the pristine vdW heterostructure surface model, respectively. From its definition, the more negative value illustrates the better absorption capacity. Herein, we have tested six possible adsorbing patterns for both the surface sides of the InS/GaSe heterostructure, as shown in Fig. S10.† All configurations were fully geometry optimized with convergence criteria in terms of both energy and force. We obtained the static energy from −24.47 to −122.18 meV for different absorbed forms. The negative values imply that the adsorption configurations are thermodynamically stable. For the GaSe and InS surfaces, the water molecule absorbed on the surface with the minimum absorption energy  and . In the case of dissociative adsorption, one of the water decomposition products, the H2 molecule, is reduced by four photo-induced electrons together with the OH groups adsorbed onto the S atoms of the InS surface of the InS/GaSe heterostructure, thus forming a surface-adsorbed hydroxyl radical (Fig. 7(a) and (b)). On the other hand, the other water decomposition product, the O2 molecule, is oxidized by four photo-induced holes on the GaSe surface of the InS/GaSe heterostructure together with the adsorbed H ions (Fig. 7(c) and (d)). These two reaction steps of the photocatalysis process are summarized as: 2H2O@InS + 4e− → 2H2↑ + 4OH−@InS,(6) 2H2O@GaSe + 4h+ → O2↑ + 4H+@GaSe.(7)
 Fig. 7  (a) The dissociation of H2O and (b) the generation process of H2 molecules on the InS surface of the InS/GaSe heterostructure. (c) The dissociation of H2O and (d) the generation process of O2 molecules on the GaSe surface of the InS/GaSe heterostructure. 
For both the reactions, the adsorbed water molecule will firstly be decomposed into H+ and OH− pairs, as shown in Fig. 7(a) and (c) for the decomposition, respectively. The corresponding decomposition reactions of water splitting at the InS and GaSe surfaces are endothermic processes with a reaction energy of 0.70 eV (from −0.14 to 0.56 eV as shown in Fig. 7(a)) and 0.84 eV (from −0.08 to 0.76 eV as shown in Fig. 7(c)), respectively. The reaction energies are smaller than the energy of the absorbed solar light according to the band gap of the vdW heterostructure. On the other hand, the negative adsorption energies of H and OH on both sides of the vdW heterostructure suggest that the adsorption processes are energetically favorable. Taking into account the fact that the band edges of the InS/GaSe heterostructure straddle the water redox potentials we have already shown, both the reduction and oxidation reactions are feasible for water adsorbed herein. Furthermore, according to Fig. 7(b), two remote H adatoms are energetically favorable to migrate closer with a −1.15 eV chemical driving force on the InS surface of the vdW heterostructure. Herein, the energy of −1.15 eV is defined as the energy difference between the two neighboring hydrogen atoms and two isolated hydrogen atoms on the InS surface by setting the total energy of two completely separated hydrogen atoms on the surface to 0. After the aggregation of the two H atoms, the formation of a corresponding H2 molecule is more energetically favorable with a chemical driving force of −2.29 eV from −1.15 to −3.44 eV as shown in Fig. 7(b). Moreover, the positive adsorption energy of the H2 molecule as small as 0.01 eV from −3.44 to −3.43 eV shown in Fig. 7(b) verifies that the desorption of the produced H2 gas is an energetically favorable process. Hence the produced H2 molecule can move away from the surface of the photocatalyst easily. On the other hand, Fig. 7(d) presents a very similar situation for the produced O2 molecule on the GaSe surface of the vdW heterostructure. Herein, the chemical driving force to push two remote O adatoms together is −2.36 eV. The corresponding driving force to achieve an O2 molecule is −2.42 eV from −2.36 to −4.78 eV. And the positive adsorption energy of the O2 molecule is 0.28 eV from −4.78 to −4.50 eV, indicating that the produced O2 gas can be easily released from the surface of the photocatalyst.
3.4 Solar cell applications
The predicted InS/GaTe and GaSe/GaTe vdW heterostructures have direct band gaps of 1.18 and 1.20 eV similar to that of bulk silicon (∼1.16 eV), which is optimal for photovoltaic application in solar cells. Based on the HSE06-TDHF calculations, the absorption coefficients of InS/GaTe and GaSe/GaTe heterostructures are shown in Fig. 8(a). Herein, the TDHF results provided us more accurate optical responses with energy distinguished peaks than the HSE06 plots in Fig. S11.† The experimentally measured absorbance of intrinsic silicon68 is represented for comparison. It is interesting to note that the overall absorption coefficients of both the vdW heterostructures are significantly larger than that of intrinsic silicon in the whole infrared and visible light range as well as part of the near ultraviolet range, which encompasses most of the solar light energy. It is also worth noting that the first absorption peaks of the InS/GaTe and GaSe/GaTe heterostructures marked in Fig. 8(a) are located at 0.93 and 1.05 eV using TDHF calculations, which follow the solar spectrum very well. Herein, the first absorption peak of the corresponding monolayers InS, GaTe, and GaSe are located at 2.38, 1.85, and 2.32 eV, respectively. Obviously, the vdW heterostructures reveal a wider absorption range compared with the corresponding monolayers, which expand the absorption edge from the visible light to infrared region. Hence, the outstanding optical performance suggests that the vdW heterostructures can harvest sunlight more efficiently than individual monolayer systems, which are promising materials for efficient photovoltaic solar cells.

(b) The solar cell power conversion efficiency contour obtained as a function of the donor band gap and conduction band offset. 
On the other hand, the type-II band structure nature of the InS/GaTe and GaSe/GaTe heterostructures protects the feature that the electron transition could occur between a donor and acceptor once the photons are absorbed in the vdW heterostructures.69 Hence, the upper limit of the power conversion efficiency (PCE) η can be estimated in the limit of 100% external quantum efficiency (EQE) by the following equation:70 (8)where 0.65 is the band-fill factor, P(ħϖ) is the AM1.5 solar energy flux at the photon energy ħϖ, Eg is the donor band gap, ΔEc is the conduction band offset, and the (Eg − ΔEc − 0.3) term is an estimation of maximum open circuit voltage. Fig. 8(b) illustrates the skeleton map of PCE as well as the calculated PCE values according to the band edge data of independent monolayers fixed in the corresponding vdW heterostructure lattices shown in Fig. S6(d) and (o).† It was found that the PCE of InS/GaTe and GaSe/GaTe heterostructures can achieve the value of 11.52% and 18.39%, respectively, which are comparable to the recently reported heterostructures of phosphorene/MoS2 (16–18%)70 and PCBM/CBN (10–20%).71 According to the tiny shifting of the conduction band offset of the acceptor GaSe, the PCE of the GaSe/GaTe heterostructure is greater than that of the InS/GaTe heterostructure. As a result, combining the features of the type-II electronic structure, a compatible band gap to silicon, and a high power conversion efficiency, the GaSe/GaTe heterostructure is a potential candidate for the application of highly efficient solar cells.
3.5 Li-Ion battery anode applications
To determine the application of a gapless semi-metallic InTe/GaS heterostructure as a flexible electrode material and as a Li-ion battery anode, the Li-adsorption behaviors have to be understood. We started from the adsorption of one Li atom on a 2 × 2 × 1 supercell of the vdW heterostructure lattice at different locations. There are three typical adsorption sites for one Li adatom in the InTe/GaS heterostructure, as shown in Fig. 9(a) and (b). Herein, the Hi site refers to Li adatoms on the outer surface of InTe with a stoichiometry of Li0.25/InTe/GaS; the Hm site indicates Li atoms embedded in the vdW gap of the InTe/GaS heterostructure with a stoichiometry of InTe/Li0.25/GaS, where the Hg site donates Li adsorbed on the outer surface of GaS with a stoichiometry of InTe/GaS/Li0.25. There were no obvious structural changes after complete structural optimization for the models of the lithiated heterostructure with different adsorption sites occupied. Table 4 lists the Li adsorption energies ELiad as well as the adsorption formation energies ELif according to the following equations: ELiad = (EInTe/GaS+Li − EInTe/GaSi − nELi)/n(9) ELif = (EInTe/GaS+Li − EInTe/GaSi − nμLi)/n(10)where EInTe/GaS+Li is the total energy of the lithiated heterostructure with n intercalated Li atoms, EInTe/GaS denotes the total energy of the pristine InTe/GaS heterostructure, ELi is the energy of an isolated Li atom, and μLi is the chemical potential of the intercalating Li metal. The negative values imply that the corresponding lithiated compounds are thermodynamically stable, indicating the feasibility of the InTe/GaS heterostructure as a Li-ion battery anode. Furthermore, from both ELiad and ELif, we found that the most energetically favorable adsorption site is the Hm site for one Li adatom in the InTe/GaS heterostructure, where Li atoms are placed inside the vdW gap. Moreover, for a better understanding, the adsorption formation process can be divided into three steps according to Liu et al. as:72 ELif = ELid + ELis + ELi−b(11)where in step-I, ELid is the Li atomization energy, corresponding to the energy cost when the Li metal is evaporated to form isolated Li atoms. The atomization step-I is the same for all the lithiated materials. The optB86b determined Li atomization energy is 1.634 eV per Li, which agrees well with the experimental value corrected for the zero-point energy of 1.67 eV per Li.73 In step-II, ELis is the energy cost of the intercalation of Li in the InTe/GaS heterostructure, arising from both in-plane stretching and interlayer expansion in the heterostructure lattice. In step-III, −ELi−b = ELib indicates the fall in energy of the Li atoms ELi−b intercalated into the strained InTe/GaS heterostructure, where a stronger binding corresponds to a lower value of ELi−b. As seen from ELis and ELi−b in Table 4, the insertion of Li atoms into the vdW gap results in much stronger Li-bonding, with a very negative ELi−b. At the same time, the Li induced lattice distortion effect is less significant. The stronger Li-bonding explains why the Hm site in the vdW gap for one Li adatom in the InTe/GaS heterostructure is the most energetically favorable case. Hence, the first Li atom prefers to occupy the vacancy in the vdW gap of the InTe/GaS heterostructure instead of the outer surfaces of InTe or GaS.

The theoretical open circuit voltages (OCV) correspond to the inverse of the Li-adsorption formation energy OCV = −ELif and are listed in Table 4. The calculated OCV for Li0.25/InTe/GaS, InTe/Li0.25/GaS, and InTe/GaS/Li0.25 systems are 0.101, 0.737, and 0.211 V, respectively, which are comparable to the Ti2C and Ti3C2 MXenes.74–76 We have further found that one 2 × 2 × 1 InTe/GaS supercell can accommodate up to 28 Li atoms without any structural distortion shown in Fig. 9(c), corresponding to a chemical ratio of Li3/InTe/Li/GaS/Li3 with an adsorption energy of −2.355 eV and an open circuit voltage of 0.721 V. The electron localized function (ELF) value of 0.5 around the outer Li layers shown in Fig. 9(d) presents the typical delocalized free electron gas feature,3,77 which indicates the stabilization of the adsorptive Li atoms because of the substantial electron transfer from the inner Li layer to the outer layer.78 It is worth noting that the hybrid heterostructure of Li3/InTe/Li/GaS/Li3 provides a desirable high Li storage capacity of 545 mA h g−1 according to:79 (12)which is greater than 372 mA h g−1 of graphite.80
To better clarify the atomic bonding nature in the Li adsorbed InTe/GaS heterostructure, the charge transfer was estimated quantitatively using Bader charge81 analysis presented in Table 4 together with the charge density differences (CDD) presented in Fig. S12.† The positive and negative values of the Bader charge indicate the gain and loss of electron charges, corresponding to the yellow and blue CDD plots. For all cases, a net loss of electronic charge of Li can be found from both the Bader charge and CDD results. For Li atoms adsorbed on the outer surface of InTe (Li0.25/InTe/GaS), the calculated charge of Li is −0.859|e|, and the corresponding charges of InTe and GaS are +0.616|e| and +0.243|e|, respectively. Therefore, we can conclude that the electron charge of Li atoms is mainly transferred to the adjacent InTe layer. Similarly, for Li atoms adsorbed on the outer surface of GaS (InTe/GaS/Li0.25), the charge transfers from the Li atoms to the InTe and GaS layers are −0.028|e| and +0.913|e|, respectively. This phenomenon indicates that Li adsorption not only leads to the ionization of Li but also excites the charge transfer from the InTe layer to the GaS layer. For the case when one Li atom is embedded in the vdW gap (InTe/Li0.25/GaS), it is easy to understand that the electron charge is transferred to both sides of the heterostructure. The charge transfer data from the Li atoms to the InTe and GaS layers of +0.306 and +0.561|e| indicates the fact that GaS monolayers are stronger charge acceptors than InTe monolayers.
4. Conclusion
In summary, we have systematically investigated the geometrical structures, electronic structures, and optical properties of III–VI (MX, M = Ga, In and X = S, Se, Te) based vdW heterostructures and their corresponding applications in sustainable energy related areas by vdW corrected density functional theory calculations. The formation energy to lattice mismatch plots confirms the corresponding stability of the MX (M1X1/M2X2, M1X1 as the top layer, M2X2 as the bottom layer) vdW heterostructures. From the electronic structure screening, type-I straddling, type-II staggered as well as type-IV semi-metallic heterostructures can be achieved, which is determined by the coefficient of the lattice mismatch and vdW interaction. As characterized by the band structures and band edge alignments, InS/GaSe, InSe/GaSe, InS/GaS and GaS/GaSe heterostructures have been marked as potential photocatalysts for visible light water splitting. Due to the type-II electronic structure nature, the InS/GaSe and GaS/GaSe vdW heterostructures not only have significantly improved photocatalysis properties but can also separately produce hydrogen and oxygen at the opposite parts of the vdW heterostructures. Furthermore, the GaSe/GaTe and InS/GaTe heterostructures have been proposed to be potential candidates for the application of highly efficient solar cells combining the features of the type-II electronic structure and the compatible band gap to silicon. According to the tiny shifting of the conduction band offset of the acceptor GaSe, the power conversion efficiency of the GaSe/GaTe heterostructure is greater than that of the InS/GaTe heterostructure. Meanwhile, due to the gapless type-IV semi-metallic electronic structure, the InTe/GaS heterostructure has been predicted to be a Li-ion battery anode material with a Li storage capacity of 545.043 mA h g−1 and an open circuit voltage of 0.721 V based on the three-step lithiated analysis of the Li-adsorption preferences. The present study will benefit the further development of vdW heterostructures for sustainable energy related applications.
