    , Accepted 10th October 2022First published on 11th October 2022AbstractMany concerns have been raised about ecological and environmental risks from the disposal of red mud (RM) in the aluminium industry. For a long time a suitable use for RM, due to the huge amount produced, has been needed. This study, for the first time, applies RM as an efficient electrochemical catalyst in the emerging nitrate-to-ammonia reduction reaction (NARR) based on renewable energy, in which the produced green ammonia can supply energy for rechargeable ammonia energy storage (RAES). The performance of RM stands out among many other synthetic catalysts in the NARR as well as further combination with photovoltaic technology. Specifically, it exhibits a superior faradaic efficiency toward NH3 of 92.8% and an NH3 formation rate of 0.16 mmol cm−2 h−1 under −0.73 V (vs. reversible hydrogen electrode) in a neutral phosphate buffer solution with 1.0 M NO3−. The energy efficiency toward NH3 is over 30% in a two-electrode system, and that of the solar-to-NH3 conversion is 2.09% at a light intensity of 0.06 W cm−2 based on a commercial poly-Si photovoltaic cell. The results promise a low-cost RM catalyst for the NARR sustainable route, realizing RM recycling and zero-carbon ammonia-energy production.
Introduction
Red mud (RM, also called bauxite residue) is a waste product from the aluminium industry.1–3 Its global production has been over 100 million metric tons per year.4,5 The lack of effective management solutions results in its disposal in landfills, thus raising many concerns about its ecological and environmental risks in view of its caustic nature and the presence of trace metals.6 This worsens with the increased demand for and production of aluminium and thus the increased amounts of RM byproduct worldwide.7,8 The aluminium industry also heavily depends on electricity supply, which is mainly from fossil fuels, leading to emission of global-warming gas. Therefore, the utilization of both RM and renewable energy is highly demanding.
RM, rich in iron, titanium and rare earth elements (REEs), has previously been a candidate for catalysts or catalyst supports.9,10 Jahromi et al. revealed the supporting effect of RM on nickel catalysts in promoting the hydrodeoxygenation of pinyon–juniper catalytic pyrolysis oil and eliminating coke formation.11 Pre-treated RM can provide both acidic and basic sites with oxygen vacancies to enhance the ketonization of oxygenates derived from fast pyrolysis oil.12 RM-loaded biochar with active Fe0 and Fe2+ favoring 1O2 generation displays a superior catalytic effect on the degradation of organic dyes and antibiotics.13 Studies attributed the abundant Fe content and the innate Fe2O3/AlSiOx heterostructure in RM to its catalytic roles.
Among many new catalytic processes, the electrocatalytic nitrate-to-ammonia reduction reaction (NARR) is an emerging route to convert renewable energy to green ammonia.14–19 Furthermore, ammonia can be a high-density energy vector. This realizes zero-carbon artificial nitrogen reduction, as well as renewable energy storage via the ammonia medium. In this respect, the NARR can be a more powerful technique in rechargeable ammonia energy storage (RAES) compared to N2 reduction.20–22 The NARR has advantages in both thermodynamics and dynamics, because splitting the polar N–O bond is much easier than that of the inert N bond to promote the NH3 formation rate (rNH3) of the NARR by several orders of magnitude.23 The NARR is also intrinsically highly endothermic (NO3− + H2O → NH3 + O2 + OH−, ΔrHθ = +503.1 kJ mol−1) and thus provides a higher energy storage capacity, an alternative to the N2 reduction route (1/2 N2 + 3/2 H2O → NH3 + 3/4 O2, ΔrHθ = +382.8 kJ mol−1).24 Many efficient NARR catalysts have been developed in the past two years, involving Ru-,25 Pd-,26 Ag-,27 Cu-,28 Ni-,29 Co-30,31 and Fe-based catalysts,32 especially the latter one due to its catalytic efficiency and lower cost.33–35 For instance, Li et al. reported an iron-based single-atom NARR catalyst with a maximum ammonia yield of 2.75 mgNH3 h−1 cm−2 and a faradaic efficiency toward NH3 (FENH3) of nearly 100% under alkaline conditions.36 This is not true upon switching to favorable neutral conditions. Wang and his co-workers developed the Fe single-atom NARR catalyst on nitrogen-doped carbon in 0.1 M K2SO4 and 0.5 M KNO3 solution, giving a maximal FENH3 of only 75%.37 Zhang and his co-workers developed a metal–organic framework (MOF)-derived Fe@Fe2O3 in 0.1 M Na2SO4 with 50 ppm NO3−, improving the FENH3 to 79.1%.35 Our previous studies reported that the switch from sulfates to a phosphate electrolyte notably increased FENH3.38 Nanorod-shaped FeOOH on carbon paper displayed a superior FENH3 of 92% in 0.1 M phosphate buffer solution (PBS) with 0.1 M NaNO3.39 Furthermore, the goal toward the industrialization of NRAA demands a better total cell energy efficiency toward NH3 (EENH3). But so far the highest total cell EENH3 among a few cases is only 26.2% which was reported by Yu et al. in a two-electrode configuration in alkaline media using two-dimensional iron-based cyano-coordination polymer nanosheets.40
Herein, we developed for the first time a waste-derived RM as a NARR electrocatalyst in light of it being rich in iron. The results are unexpectedly superior even under neutral PBS with 1.0 M NO3−, in view of the FENH3 of 92.8% and rNH3 of 0.16 mmol cm−2 h−1. Furthermore, in a two-electrode asymmetric system, the maximum energy efficiency toward NH3 (EENH3) of over 30% was achieved, outperforming many other synthetic catalysts. The realization of industrization was demonstrated under a commercial poly-Si photovoltaic cell at a light intensity of 0.06 W cm−2, and the energy efficiency achieved in solar-to-NH3 conversion (EESolar-to-NH3) was 2.09%. The results promise a low-cost RM electrocatalyst for a sustainable NARR route, realizing RM recycling and zero-carbon ammonia-energy production.
Results and discussion
Compositions and structures of RM
Firstly, we employed X-ray diffraction (XRD, Fig. 1a) to reveal the compositions and crystalline phases of the RM sample. It can be found that the main components are Fe2O3 (PDF#72-0469), AlO(OH) (PDF#88-2351), Na6(Al6Si6O24)(CaCO3)(H2O)2 (Cancrinite, PDF#71-0776), Ca2.93Al1.97Si0.64O2.56(OH)9.44 (Katoite, PDF#84-0917) and CaCO3 (PDF#86-2339), which were further verified by their lattice spacing in high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM, Fig. 1b, Fig. S1 and S2†). Notably, unique epitaxial heterostructures between Fe2O3 and CaCO3 are observed, which should benefit from their matching symmetries (both are crystallized in the Rc space group). Moreover, the corresponding energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) elemental mapping images (Fig. 1c) indicate that the AlxSiyO moieties serve as matrix and support Fe2O3 particles. Interestingly, the overlap between Ti and Fe elements indicates that Ti is likely to be incorporated in the Fe2O3 lattice. The aggregation states of these polyhedral crystalline particles are shown by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Fig. S3†) as well. And the survey profile of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) helps to confirm the major elements on the RM surface (Fig. 1d). Moreover, the high-resolution Fe2p XPS profiles at about 711.0 and 724.5 eV revealed the slightly lower ferric oxidation state in RM compared to pure Fe2O3 (Fig. S4†),41 which implies the electronic interaction between Fe2O3 and some specific components. Subsequently, in order to obtain the quantitative content, the sample was analyzed using an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES). As shown in Fig. 1e and Fig. S5,† the maximal metal element is Fe (20.4%), corresponding to the 29.2% mass ratio of Fe2O3. Besides, 77 K N2 sorption isotherm reveals the existence of mesopores in RM (mainly at 2.8 nm), which is probably beneficial for the exposure of the Fe2O3 active surface (Fig. S6†).

Electrocatalytic NARR activity of RM
To verify the catalytic activity of RM in the NARR, three-electrode electrochemical tests were performed in a neutral phosphate buffer solution (PBS, pH = 7). On switching the electrolyte solution from blank PBS to KNO3-containing PBS, the current densities of linear sweep voltammetry (LSV, Fig. 2a) and cyclic voltammetry (CV, Fig. S7†) curves increase obviously, implying the catalytic activity of RM in nitrate reduction (Fig. 2a). A 30 min static electrolysis under −0.73 V vs. RHE was used and the produced NH4+ was detected by the proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) spectra (Fig. 2b). Moreover, in the 15N isotope labeling experiment with the adoption of 15NO3− as the reactant, solely the produced 15NH4+ featuring double peaks at chemical shifts of 6.93 and 7.11 ppm can be found, verifying the conversion of NO3−-to-NH3.42 To further track the nitrate reduction process, not only NH3 but NO2−, a by-product of the NARR, were monitored in the cathodic electrolyte by prolonging the reaction time from 0.5 to 10 h (Fig. 2c). It can be observed that the increase of NO2− and NH3, which demonstrated that the reduction of NO3−-to-NH3 and NO3−-to-NO2− occurred in parallel, and their selectivities both are essentially unchanged during the 10-hour electrolysis (Fig. S8†). Furthermore, by calculating the faradaic efficiencies (FE), it can be found that FE toward NH3 (FENH3) continues to decrease with time (Fig. S9†), indicating that the consumption of the reactant and accumulation of the product is unfavorable for the selectivity toward NH3. Therefore, unless otherwise specified, the reaction time for subsequent experiments is fixed at 30 min for in-depth investigations toward its optimization. Briefly, the optimal NARR conditions for RM are found to be under −0.73 V vs. RHE with 1.0 M NO3− for 30 min. Fig. 2d shows RM's concentration-dependent NARR performance under a voltage of −0.73 V vs. RHE. Both volcano-shape curves for FENH3 and rNH3 with increasing nitrate concentration from 0.1 to 2.0 M suggest the optimal coverage of reaction species for the NARR in 1.0 M NO3− (FENH3 of 92.8% and rNH3 of 0.16 mmol cm−2 h−1). Moreover, both FENH3 and rNH3 increase with decreasing applied potential from −0.58 to −0.73 V; however, below −0.73 V vs. RHE, FENH3 slightly downturns with the potential decreasing alternatively to the continuous increase of rNH3 (Fig. 2e). This shows that the voltage decrease (overpotential increase) can input more energy to improve the overall electrochemical reaction rate, but too high energy injection may accelerate side reactions; −0.73 V is just around the critical point of this system. Furthermore, it is worth noting that it still remains above 84% during the FENH3 decline stage, illustrating the great advantage of RM on high NH3 selectivity. More detailed description of the effects on potentials and reactant concentrations are shown in the ESI file.† In addition, negligible Fe leaching in the electrolyte solution after catalysis is confirmed by ICP-OES to exclude its interference in colorimetric analysis. Long-term electrolysis was performed to evaluate the stability and recyclability of RM in the NARR and the catalytic period was set as 4 hours per cycle. As shown in Fig. 2f, not only the reaction current density can be maintained above 22 mA cm−2, but also the FENH3 per cycle is also stable at about 80% through seven consecutive cycles using the same electrode, demonstrating the excellent durability of RM. Notably, FENH3 is lower than 92.8% due to its longer electrolysis time per cycle. Furthermore, both XRD (Fig. S10†) and XPS (Fig. S11†) provide step-forward proof of the stability of RM during electrocatalysis. And highly crystalline Fe2O3 observed in the post-tested HRTEM helps to verify its stability as well (Fig. S12†).

To determine the advantage of the direct use of RM, a step-forward comparison with commercial pure Fe2O3 was conducted. The Fe2O3 sample was characterized by XPS (Fig. 3a), XRD (Fig. S13†) and SEM (Fig. S14†) prior to the NARR test. Notably, the Fe2p3/2 peak exhibits a shift of 1.7 eV between RM and Fe2O3, suggesting a lower ferric oxidation state of RM over pure Fe2O3. And electrochemical active surface area (ECSA, Fig. S15–S17†) reveals that RM (ECSA = 45.8 cm2 cm−2) can provide more electrocatalytic sites than Fe2O3 (ECSA = 4.34 cm2 cm−2), probably benefiting from its unique mesoporous structure (Fig. S18†). However, Fe2O3 achieves higher current densities than RM according to the LSV curves (Fig. 3b). Meanwhile, through the static-voltage electrolysis for 30 min, Fe2O3 produces more faradaic charges compared to RM as well (Fig. S19†). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS, Fig. 3c and Fig. S20†) revealed that the charge transfer resistance (Rct) of RM (3.39 Ω) is smaller than that of Fe2O3 (3.69 Ω). Fig. 3d compares the FENH3 achieved in 1.0 M NO3− under different voltages for 30 min between the RM and the Fe2O3 sample. Unexpectedly, RM outperforms Fe2O3 on FENH3 and displays the highest FENH3 of 92.8% among all testing conditions, although its rNH3 is lower than Fe2O3 (Fig. S21†). The insightful understanding of the promoted NH3 selectivity of Ti-decorated RM is revealed by density functional theory (DFT) calculation (Fig. S22†). The Ti-doped Fe2O3 displayed a more moderate reaction energy at +0.529 eV, in contrast to +2.076 eV for only Fe2O3. The insight into the high NH3 selectivity of RM catalysts possibly benefits from the intergrowth of Ti atoms with Fe2O3 lattices. The above results on the one hand illustrate the advantages of RM with high FENH3 and NH3 selectivity in the electrocatalytic NARR, and on the other hand point out the future development direction to improve the charge transport efficiency of RM.

Energy efficiency of electricity-to-ammonia
Except for the half reaction, we also evaluated the impact of the total cell voltage toward the NARR process on RM catalysts, and a RM/carbon cloth (RM/CC, cathode) and nickel foam (anode) were integrated into an asymmetric two-electrode H-cell reactor, in which the cathodic electrolyte contains 1.0 M KNO3 and 1.0 M PBS while 1.0 M NaOH in the anodic electrolyte. Fig. 4a shows the respective polarization curves of the cathode and the anode measured in a 2-electrode configuration. The onset potential for the full cell can be estimated to be 1.35 V (1.0 mA cm−2), which is the lowest among all reported research. We then evaluated the efficiency of the two-electrode setup by increasing the total cell voltage from 1.5 to 4.0 V. Fig. 4b summarizes the effects of total cell voltages on the full cell energy efficiency toward NH3 (EENH3) and the electrical power consumption (EPC, in kWh kgNH3−1), respectively, both of which are inversely proportional numerically. Generally, the EPC gradually increases and EENH3 declines with increasing total cell voltage, and the lowest EPC of 29.4 kWh kgNH3−1 appears at 1.5 V, corresponding to the highest EENH3 of 33.2%, which outperforms other NARR catalysts among all publications (Table S1†). However, although EENH3 downturns with the increase of cell voltage, FENH3 can be maintained at a relatively high level, and even achieves a maximum value of 90% at 3.3 V (Fig. 4c); meanwhile, rNH3 also increases remarkably from 0.007 to 0.434 mmol cm−2 h−1. This phenomenon indicates that the major decrease of EENH3 is probably due to the increase in energy consumption from ion migration, rather than the decline of electrode reaction efficiency. In other words, improving ion mobility is the key to the design of RM-based two-electrode NARR cells in the future.

In addition, in light of the zero-carbon emission vision, the RM-based NARR cell was also driven by a commercial poly-Si solar cell. Fig. S23† shows the NH3 production and the corresponding carbon emission reduction under different light intensities. Moreover, under our test conditions, the maximum energy efficiency of solar-to-NH3 conversion (EESolar-to-NH3) can reach 2.09% at a light intensity of 0.06 W cm−2, comparable with the 3.4% of the Fe-MoS2 single-atom catalyst by an InGaP/GaAs/Ge triple-junction solar cell.43 In short, RM is a promising NARR catalyst in zero-carbon ammonia synthesis.
Experimental
Preparation of the working electrode
A massive amount of RM was ground in an agate mortar and sieved through a 125-μm mesh. The obtained RM powders were washed with pure water for 24 h using a Soxhlet extractor to remove the water-soluble impurities. And then the RM was dried in an oven at 60 °C.
5 mg RM was dispersed in 1.2 mL of 1:1 v/v water/ethanol with 20 μL Nafion by one-hour sonication to form a homogeneous suspension. CC (1 × 1 cm2) was cleaned with anhydrous alcohol and deionized water for 1 h through ultrasonication prior to RM deposition. Then the RM ink was dropped onto carbon cloth to yield a RM loading of 0.8 mg cm−2. As for pure Fe2O3, the mass loading was reduced to 0.24 mg cm−2 to ensure the same Fe content on the working electrode with the RM one.
Electrochemical measurements
All electrochemical tests were performed on ZAHNER PP211 and CHI760 electrochemical workstations. The electrolyte solution was bubbled by Ar flow for at least 30 min prior to electrochemical experiments. The electrocatalysis tests were performed in gas-tight H-cells separated by a proton exchange membrane (Nafion 211) at room temperature. The proton exchange membranes were activated in dilute 5 wt% H2SO4 aqueous solution at 80 °C for 0.5 h, and then washed with copious amounts of water and soaked in distilled water for at least 3 h. 15 mL of the electrolyte was used in the cathodic chamber.
For the three-electrode system, an ultra-pure graphite rod and an Ag/AgCl electrode saturated KCl solution (E(Ag/AgCl) = 0.197 V) were employed as the counter electrode and the reference electrode, respectively. A RM coated CC (1 × 1 cm2) was the working electrode. All potentials in this work were expressed with reference to the RHE, which can be calculated by the Nernst equation:E(RHE) = E(experiment) + 0.059 pH + E(Ag/AgCl)where E(RHE) is the converted potential and E(experiment) is the measured potential.
For the three-electrode system, a nickel foam was used as the anode and 1 M KOH aqueous solution as the anodic electrolyte.
All linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves were tested at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 without iR compensation. The catalytic performance was evaluated in the chronoamperometry mode for 0.5 h with magnetic stirring (900 rpm).
Solar-driven NARR tests were powered by the ABET Sun 3000 solar simulator at different light intensities (0.04, 0.05, 0.06, 0.07, 0.08, 0.09 and 0.10 W cm−2) for 30 min.
The FENH3, rNH3, EENH3, EESolar-to-NH3 were calculated according to the following equations:FENH3 (%) = 8 × F × c(NH3) × V/Q × 100%rNH3 (mmol cm−2 h−1) = c(NH3) × V/(A × t)EENH3 (%) = c(NH3) × V × ΔrHm/(U × I × t)EESolar-to-NH3 (%) = c(NH3) × V × ΔrHm/(L × APVC)where F is the faradaic efficiency, 96485 C mol−1; c(NH3) is the concentration of NH3; V is the volume of cathodic electrolyte, 15 mL; Q is the integrated charge during the NARR test; A is the electrode surface area, 1 cm2; t is the electrolysis time, 1800 s; ΔrHm is calculated according to the overall reaction of KNO3 + 2H2O → NH3(g) + KOH + 2O2(g), 595.5 kJ mol−1; U is the total cell voltage; I is the electrolysis current; L is the light intensity of the sun simulator; and APVC is the area of the photovoltaic cell, 210 cm2.
Conclusions
In summary, regarding the concerns over ecological and environmental risks from the tremendous production of RM, it was used as an efficient electrochemical catalyst in the emerging NARR based on renewable energy for the first time. Satisfactorily, the performance of RM stands out among many other synthetic catalysts in the NARR as well as the further combination with photovoltaic technology. Specifically, it exhibits a superior FENH3 of 92.8% and an rNH3 of 0.16 mmol cm−2 h−1 under −0.73 V (vs. RHE) in neutral PBS with 1.0 M NO3−. The EENH3 is over 30% in an asymmetric two-electrode system, and the EESolar-to-NH3 is 2.09% at a light intensity of 0.06 W cm−2 based on a commercial poly-Si photovoltaic cell. These results promise a low-cost RM catalyst for the NARR sustainable route, realizing RM recycling and zero-carbon ammonia-energy production.
