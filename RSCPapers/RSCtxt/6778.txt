    , Accepted 23rd February 2015First published on 23rd February 2015AbstractBased on a coordination chemistry approach, the present work reports on the synthesis of thin films of various cobalt hydroxycarbonate nanostructures such as nanobeams, nanoneedles, and bending nanorods using three different cobalt precursors viz. Cl−, NO3− and CH3COO−. After pyrolysis in air, the hydroxycarbonate nanostructures are transferred into 1-D arrays of Co3O4 nanorods. The obtained 1-D Co3O4 nanostructures are then transformed into the corresponding analogous shaped 1-D arrays of porous cobalt sulfide (CoS1.0365) nanostructures using a wet chemical transformation method based on an ion exchange approach. The nanostructured films before and after the ion exchange reaction are characterized using field emission electron scanning microscopy, X-ray diffraction, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS) measurements. As a proof-of-concept demonstration for the application, various shaped CoS1.0365 nanorod films synthesized are investigated as a Pt-free counter electrode in dye-sensitized-solar cells (DSSCs). The influence of three different counter anions of the cobalt precursors on the structural, textural, and morphological aspects, and thereby their influence on electronic and electrochemical properties, has been investigated. A correlation among electrical conductivity, charge transfer resistance and electrocatalytic performance of various CoS1.0365 nanorod films obtained from different cobalt precursors has been established. Among the various nanostructures, the thicker nanorod film synthesized using a chloride precursor has demonstrated the best electrocatalytic behavior toward triiodide reduction, which led to a short circuit current density of 18.04 mA cm−2 and energy conversion efficiency of 7.4% of the DSSC. This photovoltaic performance is highly competitive to a current density of 18.26 mA cm−2 and energy conversion efficiency of 7.7% exhibited by the standard Pt counter electrode.
Introduction
Solution phase-based chemical reactions are the general approach for the synthesis of various shaped nanomaterials in chalcogenide chemistry.1–3 In a conventional synthesis, shape-controlling agents are often added to the reaction bath, which are also usually incorporated into the products, and thereby they influence the targeted functionality of the materials.4 On the other hand, the experimental parameters are often entangled, and hence any attempts to control one parameter influence others, and thereby makes the process more complicated to control the size, shape, morphology and chemical composition of the targeted materials. Solution phase-based chemical conversion of various inorganic nanostructured solids from one chemical constituent into another is a simple and straightforward effective approach to fabricate various shapes. In this context, the solution-based ion exchange reaction can be an alternative option to the conventional process to fabricate various nanostructured materials, which can provide a facile and cost-effective approach to obtain high-quality shape controlled functional nanomaterials with the corresponding analogous shape of the precursor materials.5–10 In this approach, a solid film consisting of nanostructured materials is immersed in a solution containing ions to be exchanged with the solid film.11,12 Depending upon the size and type of the ion to be exchanged – for example, based on Hard-Soft [Lewis] Acid-Base (HSAB) classification as classified by the Pearson principle,13 the exchange between cations or anions of the targeted solid and the solution can be established. The kinetics of the ion exchange is limited by the diffusion barrier of the ions to be exchanged in and out of the bulk solids, and thereby complete chemical transformation of the bulk solids by the ion exchange reaction is encumbered. In contrast to the bulk solid transformation, the high aspect ratios of nanostructured materials can effectively reduce the kinetic barrier for diffusion of ions to be exchanged, and thereby lowers the activation energy for the ion exchange reaction. Consequently, a complete chemical transformation of nanostructures by ion exchange into chemically different nanomaterials can be assured.14–16 In the present work, the exchange between O2− ions from the Co3O4 nanorod film and the S2− ions from the solution is carried out, and thereby the Co3O4 nanorod film is transformed into a cobalt sulfide (CoS1.0365) nanorod film. The exchange reactions can be qualitatively understood in terms of Hard-Soft Acid-Base theory (i.e., soft acids react faster and form stronger bonds with soft bases, whereas hard acids react faster and form stronger bonds with hard bases, all other factors being equal). In the present study, Co2+ is a borderline acid and compared to O2−, S2− is a soft base. Thus, S2− binds Co2+ strongly, and thereby the conversion of Co3O4 to CoS1.0365via the anion exchange reaction is strongly favoured.
In the above ion exchange reaction, the cationic structure of the crystal is generally assumed to be preserved, while the anions undergo replacement during the exchange reaction, and thereby the shape of the nanomaterials before and after the ion exchange reaction is supposed to be preserved.17 Thus, using a solution based ion exchange protocol, 1-D arrays of Co3O4 nanorods obtained by pyrolysis of a hydroxycarbonate nanostructured film have been directly transferred into the corresponding analogous shaped porous CoS1.0365 nanorod arrays. In contrast to the tedious steps required in solid template assisted techniques,18 the present work demonstrates a very simple and efficient technique for the fabrication of 1-D nanorod structured arrays of Co3O4 and their solution based ion exchange transformation into similar shaped arrays of porous CoS1.0365 nanorods. Although the synthesis of various nanostructured morphologies, for example 1-D nanotubes,19 nanowires, 2-D nanoflakes,20,21 and 3-D nanospheres,22 have been reported, all these nanostructured products were in the powder form while the thin film consisting these nanostructured materials is highly desirable due to the fact that most of the optoelectronic and electrochemical devices require only the thin film form. In addition to the simplicity of the ion exchange approach, the technique demonstrated in the present work can directly produce a 1-D nanostructured film on various conducting as well as non-conducting substrates.
Further, to see the influence of various counter ions on the structural, textural, morphological properties of the ion exchanged nanostructures, and thereby their influence on the electronic and electrocatalytic performance, Cl−, NO3− and CH3COO− based cobalt precursors were used. Interestingly, in all cases this process is seen to exhibit a remarkable nominally shape-preserving property. A schematic representation of the complete process for nanostructure transformation is shown in Scheme 1. Cobalt sulfide exists with various stoichiometric compositions and some of them have great industrial potential for hydrodesulfurization and hydrodearomatization, while some show their applications as semiconductors, magnetic materials, supercapacitor materials, lithium-ion batteries, and various other fields.23,24 Recently, cobalt sulfide nanostructures exhibited significant electroactivity toward catalytic reduction of triiodide, and demonstrated a potential candidate for substitution of the Pt counter electrode in DSSCs. In the present work, the 1-D CoS1.0365 nanostructured film deposited on a FTO glass substrate is investigated as an electrocatalyst for triiodide reduction. The novel 1-D CoS1.0365 nanostructured film has demonstrated an excellent catalytic performance toward the reduction of triiodide, and the performance is highly competitive to that of the universally used Pt counter electrode in DSSCs.

Experimental
Chemicals
All reagents used in this experiment were of analytical grade obtained from Sigma Aldrich. CoCl2, Co(NO3)2, and Co(C5H7O2)2 were used as received. Fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) coated glass substrates used for deposition were first cleaned in detergent water, acetone and isopropyl alcohol for 10 min each using an ultrasonic bath. These substrates were dried in a stream of argon and stored for further use. Triply distilled water was used throughout the experiment.
Fabrication of cobalt hydroxycarbonate and Co3O4
In a typical experiment, 0.1 M each of CoCl2, Co(NO3)2, and Co(C5H7O2)2 were separately dissolved in 25 ml of deionized water in falcon tubes. To each of these solutions, 25 ml of 3.12% urea solution was added, and FTO glass substrates were dipped inside. The tubes were then sealed and kept in a water bath maintained at 90 °C. After completion of the reaction, pinkish color deposited films were obtained after 4 h. The pinkish cobalt hydroxycarbonate films were washed with water, dried in a stream of air and stored for further characterization. Co3O4 nanostructured films were obtained by annealing the hydroxycarbonate samples in a muffle furnace at 400 °C for 30 min in air. After annealing, the color of the sample changed from pink to dark black, indicating the formation of the Co3O4 phase.25
Fabrication of CoS1.0365 nanostructures
CoS1.0365 nanostructured films were prepared via ion exchange by a simple wet chemical method. The Co3O4 nanostructured thin film was immersed in aqueous 0.15 M sodium sulfide solution maintained at 90 °C for desired time durations in order to exchange O2− from Co3O4 with S2− to form CoS1.0365. After completion of the ion exchange reaction, the films were washed with deionised water, dried in air for 30 min and stored in the dark for further characterization.
Fabrication of dye-sensitized-solar cells
DSSCs were fabricated for evaluation of the counter electrode performance using the standard method described previously.26 In brief, a thin TiO2 blocking layer (100 nm) was deposited onto a FTO glass substrate by immersing the FTO substrate in 0.1 M TiCl4 for 45 min at 70 °C followed by annealing the substrate at 450 °C for 30 min in air. A 4 μm TiO2 layer with an average particle size of ∼20 nm was coated by the doctor blade method. A light scattering TiO2 layer (∼3 μm) was applied over the previously deposited TiO2 and sintered again at 450 °C for 30 min. The TiO2 film was then sensitized with 0.5 mM N719 prepared in absolute ethanol:acetonitrile (1:1) solution for 24 h. The iodine based electrolyte consisting of 0.1 M LiI, 0.1 M I2, and 0.6 M LiClO4 in a 50 ml acetonitrile solvent was sandwiched between the sensitized TiO2 photoanode and the platinum (Pt) counter electrode using a 50 μm polyimide adhesive tape used as the spacer. The Pt-coated FTO-glass counter electrodes were prepared by spreading a drop of 2 mM H2PtCl6 in iso-propanol onto FTO substrates and heating to 400 °C for 10 min under ambient air.26
Characterization
Crystal structures and phases of cobalt hydroxycarbonate, Co3O4 and CoS1.0365 were confirmed using an X-ray diffraction pattern (XRD) obtained on an X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku D/MAX 2500 V, Cu-Kα, l = 0.15418 nm). XRD patterns were prepared by depositing the respective films onto plain glass substrates. Morphology of electrodes was monitored using a scanning electron microscope (SEM, Hitachi S-4200). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements were performed on a JEOL-2100F transmission electron microscope with an acceleration voltage of 100 kV. High resolution TEM (HRTEM) and energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDS) were also performed on the same TEM unit. The TEM samples were prepared by dropwise addition of about 20 μl of ethanol solution consisting of dust particles of the nanostructured films onto carbon-coated copper grids and slowly dried in air. In order to evaluate the performance of CoS1.0365 films as the DSSC counter electrode, DSSC devices were fabricated as described above. The solar-to-electric power conversion efficiency of the cells was measured by irradiating the photoanode (0.25 cm2) with 100 mW cm2 white light (1 Sun) using a solar simulator (PEC-L01, Peccell) and the current density was measured using a Keithley 2400 source. Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were obtained using an Ivium CompactStat impedance analyzer in the frequency range of 0.01 Hz to 1.5 MHz. All spectra were recorded under open circuit conditions under 1 sun illumination.
Results and discussion
The formation of 1-D arrays of porous CoS1.0365 nanorods with different morphologies is schematically shown in Scheme 1. In the first step, the cobalt hydroxycarbonate film was deposited via wet chemical synthesis using aqueous solutions of urea and cobalt precursors. In the second step, annealing of the hydroxycarbonate film in air to form a Co3O4 film, and finally ion exchange reactions between the Co3O4 film and Na2S aqueous solution to obtain CoS1.0365 were carried out.
Cobalt hydroxycarbonate formation
Under hydrothermal conditions in wet chemical synthesis, urea is decomposed slowly with the formation of NH4+OH− and CO2 followed by their hydrolysis into CO32− ions as shown in reactions (1) and (2). Then, cobalt ions interact with the CO32− and OH− ions forming cobalt hydroxycarbonate as shown in reaction (3). The alkaline solution formed due to the release of NH3 and low solubility of CO2 in aqueous solution27 favours heterogeneous nucleation of cobalt hydroxy/carbonate species. It is assumed that the adsorption of OH− ions on Co2+ species enhances the polarity of negatively charged cobalt hydroxy/carbonate, and thereby the resulting dipolar interactions lead to the formation of various shaped nanostructures via electrostatic force and hydrogen bonding.28 For example, formation of nanobeams (Nbs), nanoneedles (Nns), and bending nanorods (BNrs) like 1-D nanostructures due to the above reactions can be clearly observed in Fig. 1. Based on the above reactions and the SEM images of the reaction product (Fig. 1), it is clear that urea plays an important role in the formation of 1-D morphology. Generally, evolution of gas bubbles in the reaction solution due to the formation of NH3 and CO2 from hydrolysis of urea as shown by the reaction (1) takes place. It is believed that these bubbles act as soft templates,29 and the nanoparticles of cobalt hydroxycarbonate grow at the early stage around the bubbles forming various shaped nanostructures in which the particles are loosely packed. Later, by Ostwald ripening,30 the particles grow along a certain crystallographic axis with the exposure of the (110) plane forming 1-D nanorod like morphologies. NH2CONH2 + 3H2O → 2NH4+ + 2OH− + CO2(1) CO2 + 2OH− → CO32− + H2O(2) Co2+ + xOH− + 0.5CO32− + 0.11H2O → Co (OH)x(CO3)0.5·0.11H2O(3)

Counter anion effect on morphology and crystal phase of cobalt hydroxycarbonates
The phenomenon for the formation of different shaped cobalt hydroxycarbonates (Fig. 1) can be explained on the basis of a co-ordination chemistry approach based on Pearson's Hard-Soft [Lewis] Acid-Base (HSAB) concept viz. hard acids prefer to bind with hard bases and vice versa.13 Based on this approach, metal ions and ligands can be classified into hard and soft categories. Thus, depending upon the strength of their hardness, metal ions and ligands control their interaction, and thereby it influences the shape of the hydroxycarbonate nanostructures. To investigate the influence of various counter anions on morphologies, we have chosen three different cobalt precursors viz. Co(NO3)2, CoCl2 and Co(C5H7O2)2. As there were no surfactants or complexing agents used in the present case to control the morphology, the synthesis method involves the reaction of cobalt ions with in situ released hydroxide ions by hydrolysis of urea as shown in the above reactions (1)–(3). It should be noted that the different affinities of counter anions to cobalt ions in the precursors control the local concentration of cobalt ions available for reaction (3), and thereby control the reaction kinetics. Thus, the controlled release of OH− and CO32− ions by the slow hydrolysis of urea and their reaction with different cobalt precursors might have kinetically controlled reaction (3), and thereby different morphologies of the cobalt hydroxycarbonate films as shown in Fig. 1a–d were obtained. In the present case, Co2+ is a border line acid, and it prefers to bind with a soft base more strongly than the harder one. The softness of the ligands used in these experiments is in the decreasing order of CH3COO− > NO3− > Cl−. This implies that Cl− binds cobalt ions more strongly, and thus fewer cobalt ions will be available in the shape controlling synthesis of nanomaterials. In this way, the interaction between cobalt ions and the counter ions play a role in controlling the concentrations of ions available for the reaction, and thereby it controls the shape of the product of reaction (3). In addition, slow hydrolysis of urea at higher temperatures affords controlled release of hydroxycarbonate ions. These two crucial factors mentioned above are considered to have overall control on the shape of cobalt hydroxycarbonate. Thus, as evident from the SEM images of Fig. 1, a nanobeam (Nb) like structure is formed when the chloride precursor is used (Fig. 1a and b). In contrast, nanoneedle (Nn) and bending nanorod (BNr) like structures are obtained when nitrate (Fig. 1c) and actylacetone (Fig. 1d) precursors of cobalt are used. As explained above, the distinct command of the cobalt precursors on the morphology control of the hydroxycarbonates is attributed to the Hard-Soft [Lewis] Acid-Base (HSAB) principle of Pearson.13 Indeed, with the numerous co-ordinating ligands available for metal ions, a variety of nanostructures can be synthesized using this approach. The approach is beneficial in the sense that the method does not need any concentration controlling agent to shape the targeted products.
Photo images of the hydroxycarbonate films formed on FTO substrates are shown in the inset of Fig. 1e, from which uniform and crack free deposition can be confirmed. The XRD patterns and SEM images of the cobalt hydroxycarbonate films on plain glass substrates are shown in Fig. 1. The XRD diffraction patterns of the nanoneedle (Nn) and bending nanorod (BNr) films match well with the orthorhombic hydrated cobalt hydroxycarbonate Co(OH)x(CO3)0.5·0.11H2O with a lattice constant a = 8.79 Å, b = 10.15 Å, and c = 4.43 Å (JCPDS card no. 48-0083).23a The nanobeam (Nb) structured hydroxycarbonate films obtained from the chloride precursor show a sharp diffraction pattern, which can be indexed to the cobalt basic carbonate phase of Co(CO3)0.35Cl0.20(OH)1.10, (JCPDS no. 38-547).23bFig. 1a shows that the nanobeam (Nb) film is composed of large and straight nanobeam like structures having a length of ∼1.3 μm and width of ∼120 nm. Cobalt nitrate based hydroxycarbonate seems to have needle like tips called here as nanoneedles (Nns). These structures are ∼900 μm in length with diameters ranging from 90 to100 nm on an average. 5 to 15 nm on the top of this structure looks like a needle tip (Fig. 1c). On the other hand, cobalt acetylacetonate based hydroxycarbonate consists of ∼750 nm long bending nanorods with a diameter of ∼200 nm at the bottom and less than ∼25 nm at the tip (Fig. 1d).
In a further experiment, we transformed the above hydroxycarbonate film into a cobalt oxide film by thermal treatment at 400 °C for 30 min in air. After annealing, the color of all the films has changed from pink to dark black (Fig. 2a, inset), indicating the transformation of cobalt hydroxycarbonate into a stable cobalt oxide spinel phase.23a This was further confirmed from the XRD measurements shown in Fig. 2a. After annealing, all samples showed reflections corresponding to the cobalt oxide as a pure spinel phase with a lattice constant of a = 8.083 Å, which is consistent with the JCPDS card no. 42-1467.31 The intensity of diffraction peaks is the highest in the case of nanobeam (Nb) films followed by the nanoneedle (Nn) film, and the bending nanorod (BNr) film. The Nb, Nn and BNr films retain the high crystallinity even after annealing and transforming into cobalt oxide. Thus, even after conversion to cobalt oxide, the nanostructures are observed to maintain the crystallinity order as in the case of hydroxycarbonate films shown in Fig. 1e. Fig. 2b–e show the surface morphology of the thermally oxidized films. Before thermal oxidation, the Nb nanostructured hydroxycarbonate had flat morphology (Fig. 1a). However, after the thermal treatment, the conversion of nanostructures towards cylindrical nanorod like morphology can be clearly observed (Fig. 2b and c). In contrast, the original morphology is preserved after annealing in the case of Nn and BNr, but few cracks/shrinkage are formed on the nanostructures, possibly due to the evolution of CO2 and additional weight loss. However, the films retain the topography and crystallinity as described above.

SEM top views of various shaped Co3O4 nanostructured films: (b) Nb, (c) low magnified image of ‘b’, (d) Nn, and (e) BNr. 
The chemical composition and electronic defect structure in the cobalt oxide samples were investigated using XPS analysis. The Co 2p core level spectra of the thermally oxidized Nb, Nn and BNr samples are shown in Fig. S1a–c (ESI†). These XPS spectra of the different samples look nearly identical, indicating the identical nature of Co2+ in all three samples. Fig. S1d–f† show the O 1s core-level spectra of the various cobalt oxide samples. It is clear from the XPS O 1s spectra that there are two peaks in each spectrum (Fig. S1d–f†). The peak at 529.7 eV corresponds to oxygen bonds in Co–O–Co while the one at 530.9 is related to oxygen vacancies in the bulk of metal oxide. For all the samples, the relative intensities of the two O 1s peaks are significantly different due to different degrees of oxygen vacancies, and the spectrum with larger area under a peak of 530.9 eV indicates higher number of oxygen vacancies.32
In order to transfer Co3O4 nanostructured film into CoS1.0365 by an ion exchange approach, the thermally obtained Co3O4 films on glass substrates were immersed into an aqueous solution of 0.15 M Na2S in a closed bottle at 90 °C for various periods (e.g., 3 h, 12 h, 24 h, and 36 h). During the course of the reaction, the surface morphology of the nanostructures, especially the surface texture, was found to be changed gradually with the ion exchange time as shown in Fig. S2a–g (ESI†). We chose here a nanobeam (Nb) structured thin film for investigation, and 3 h, 12, 24 and 36 h dipping time was used for a detailed study and observation of morphological changes during transformation of Co3O4 into CoS1.0365. SEM images of the Co3O4 before and after 3 h (3 h-CoS1.0365), 6 h (6 h-CoS1.0365), 9 h (9 h-CoS1.0365), 12 h (12 h-CoS1.0365), 24 h (24 h-CoS1.0365), and 36 h (36 h-CoS1.0365) of ion exchange are shown in Fig. S2(a–g) and (h–n).† From Fig. S2a,† it can be seen that the Co3O4 nanorods before ion exchange had a smooth surface. After 3 h of ion exchange reaction, the nanorod morphology remained the same, but the surface of each nanorod looks like having surface etching as shown by the rough surface and several flakes projecting to the space from the surface in Fig. S2b.† Further extending the ion exchange time, the surface again became smooth with gradual changes in the surface texture each time (Fig. S2c–f†). For example, after 24 h of ion exchange, the 24 h-CoS1.0365 nanorods show that they consisted of small tiny nanoflakes similar to fish scales packed together hierarchically (Fig. S2f†). In contrast, after 36 h of ion exchange reaction, densely packed spherical nanounits over the entire surface of the 36 h-CoS1.0365 nanorods can be observed (Fig. S2g†). However, for a prolonged ion exchange reaction, for example 36 h, fracture of the ion exchanged nanorods into shorter ones is observed (Fig. S2g and n†). Further, kinetics of the ion exchange reaction leading to transformation of Co3O4 into CoS1.0365 was studied using XRD analysis of the above ion exchanged samples at different intervals of the ion exchange period as described above in Fig. S2.† Fig. S3 (ESI†) shows XRD patterns of the Co3O4 nanostructured films before and after ion exchange for different intervals of time. The diffraction pattern of the Co3O4 nanostructures before ion exchange can be indexed to Co3O4 according to JCPDS no. 42-1467. After immersion of the Co3O4 film into Na2S solution, the ion exchange reaction seems to be started from an early stage as gradual changes in XRD patterns after different intervals of ion exchange time can be noticed in Fig. S3.† The XRD diffraction pattern of the 3 h-CoS1.0365 nanorod film after 3 h of conversion period shows significant reduction of diffraction peaks, but still the existence of minute remaining of the peaks from the Co3O4 phase can be observed, which indicates that the targeted conversion to well crystalline CoS1.0365 has not yet been completed. Although the disappearance of diffraction peaks from the Co3O4 phase and gradual changes in XRD patterns beyond 3 h of ion exchange reaction can be observed in Fig. S3,† no clear crystalline phase of cobalt sulfide can be pinpointed until 24 h of ion exchange reaction. After 24 h of ion exchange, the diffraction pattern can be indexed to the CoS1.0365 phase according to JCPDS no. 19-0365. Beyond 24 h of ion exchange – for example 36 h, the diffraction peaks from the CoS1.0365 phase can still be ascertained, but considerable reduction in peak intensities is observed, which could be due to the formation of some amorphous substance on the surface of the 36 h-CoS1.0365 nanorod film. This finding suggests the completion of targeted conversion in 24 h of ion exchange reaction when a 8.5 μm thick Co3O4 nanorod film was used (Fig. 3a).

The cross-sectional SEM images of the Co3O4 and 24 h-CoS1.0365 films are shown in Fig. 3a and b. The thicknesses of both films can be estimated to be ∼8.5 μm. Fig. 3a and b show that the nanorods are erected vertically in a free-standing 1-D array fashion, and their strong adherence to the FTO substrate can be perceived. SEM top views of the chemically transformed CoS1.0365 nanostructures for 24 h of ion exchange reaction of Co3O4 derived from various cobalt precursors are shown in Fig. 3c–f, which reveal the formation of 1-D porous nanorods after ion exchange reaction (see Fig. 2 and 3), and the morphology looks like an elephant trunk. The conversion into porous structure after the ion exchange reaction can be due to the Kirkindall effect.33 It is noteworthy that in Fig. 3a and b that the vertically oriented self-standing 1-D nanorod arrays of Co3O4 have completely transformed into exactly similar 1-D arrays of self-standing CoS1.0365 morphology. This result strongly supports the shape preserving strategy for constructing 1-D arrays of CoS1.0365 nanorods from 1-D nanorod arrays of Co3O4.
Fig. S4a and b (ESI†) and inset pictures in Fig. 4a and b show TEM images of the Co3O4 nanorods derived from the chloride cobalt precursor, and the same nanorods after 24 h of the ion exchange reaction (i.e., 24 h-CoS1.0365). These TEM images reveal that the Co3O4 nanorods possess loosely arranged solid spherical and elliptical nanostructural units. This observation is in line with that of the SEM images. The loose arrangements of the nanounits were probably beneficial for the diffusion of sulfide ions during the ion exchange reaction. After 24 h of the ion exchange process, the ion exchanged nanorods turned much denser with closely packed hollow spherical nanounits as shown in Fig. S4b.† The above nanostructured Co3O4 and 24 h-CoS1.0365 samples were further investigated using HRTEM. HRTEM images of a single nanounit of the Co3O4 and 24 h-CoS1.0365 nanorod samples are shown in Fig. 4a and b, respectively. Fig. 4a shows lattice spacing of approximately 0.28 nm, which matches well with the (311) plane of Co3O4 (JCPDS no. 42-1467). Similarly, the lattice spacing in the case of the 24 h-CoS1.0365 sample is approximately 0.29 nm, which can be matched well with the (100) planar spacing of CoS1.0365 (JCPDS no. 19-0365). The selected area electron diffraction patterns (SAED) of these samples are shown in Fig. 4c and f, which reveal that the nanorods are polycrystalline. These results of SAED and HRTEM are in good agreement with the results shown by XRD patterns in Fig. 2a and S3.† In order to investigate if the ion exchange reaction took place uniformly throughout the oxide nanorods, EDS elemental mapping of Co, O and S in a single nanorod was performed using an EDS analyser coupled to TEM, and the results are shown in Fig. 5. Fig. 5Ib and c suggest that there has been a uniform distribution of Co and O throughout the Co3O4 nanorod, and the EDS quantitative analysis showed Co and O in the atomic ratio of 0.67 (Fig. S5a, ESI†). After the ion exchange reaction for 24 h, a uniform distribution of Co and S can be ascertained throughout the ion exchanged nanorod (i.e., 24 h-CoS1.0365) in Fig. 5IIc and d, and the EDS quantitative analysis showed Co and S in the atomic ratio of 0.71 (Fig. S5b†). The EDS mapping of O in the ion exchanged nanorod for 24 h (Fig. 5IIb) shows the presence of a very little amount of oxygen, which might be due to the air adsorbed into the pores of the nanorod. This finding indicates a complete conversion of oxide nanorods into sulfide by the ion exchange reaction for 24 h.

Further, complete transformation of Co3O4 into CoS1.0365 by the proposed ion exchange approach has also been confirmed by investigating the line EDS scanning of the aged ion exchanged nanorods as shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†). The EDS line scanning profile of the ion exchanged nanorod in Fig. S6† shows only a trace amount of oxygen. However, hardly any accumulation of oxygen particularly at the nanorod surface can be noticed. This finding supports the complete ion exchange of the oxide nanorod into sulfide. In addition, the finding also indicates the stability of the sulfide nanorod film against atmospheric oxidation. A complete chemical composition of the ion exchanged nanorod film was investigated using an XPS analysis. The Co 2p and S 2p core level XPS spectra are shown in Fig. S7a and b,† respectively, which show the characteristic peaks located at the binding energy corresponding to that of cobalt sulfide. After the ion exchange reaction, the Co 2p peaks have been shifted to lower binding energy. In addition, the nanorod film shows the existence of S 2p peaks only after the ion exchange reaction (Fig. S7b†). These results are in line with the result of TEM-EDS analysis (Fig. 5 and S6†), and the finding suggests that the oxide nanorod film has been converted into sulfide by the ion exchange reaction. Further, compositional confirmation of the ion exchanged nanorod film (i.e., 24 h-CoS1.0365) has been performed using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), which revealed a Co to S mole ratio of 0.9633. The ICP-MS data are very close to CoS1.0365 (having a mole ratio of Co to S = 0.9647), which has been further confirmed by XRD patterns, and crystal lattice spacing of CoS1.0365 as shown in Fig. S3† and 4b, respectively.
Recently, metal chalcogenides have been investigated as counter electrode materials for replacing the expensive Pt counter electrode in I3−/I− redox shuttle DSSCs.34 One of the primary criteria for a material to be used as an electrode is its good electrical conductivity. In the present work, all the porous CoS1.0365 nanorod films exhibited ohmic behaviour with different degrees of conductivity in the order of Nb-CoS1.0365 (chloride-precursor) > Nn-CoS1.0365 (nitrate-precursor) > BNr-CoS1.0365 (acetylacetonate-precursor) as shown in Fig. 6. These conductivity behaviors are very favourable for the materials to be investigated as a counter electrode. In addition to the good electrical conductivity, the electrode material must have a good electrocatalytic activity towards the reduction of triiodide. Fig. 7a shows the cyclic voltammograms (CVs) exhibited by the Pt, Co3O4 and CoS1.0365 film electrodes in an I3−/I− redox electrolyte. The Co3O4 film electrodes before the ion exchange reaction do not show any catalytic reaction. However, the CoS1.0365 films obtained after the ion exchange reaction show a pair of redox peaks in CVs – a cathodic peak corresponding to the I3− + 3e− → 3I− redox reaction and an anodic peak corresponding to the reverse oxidation reaction can be clearly observed in all CoS1.0365 film electrodes. These CVs are similar to the CV exhibited by the Pt film electrode. This finding suggests that the CoS1.0365 film electrode is capable for the above catalytic reactions. These electrodes were further characterized by measuring electrochemical impedances of the dummy cells constructed using two identical electrodes. Fig. 7b shows the Nyquist plots, which exhibit the degree of charge transfer resistance of the above electrocatalytic redox reactions across various CoS1.0365 film electrodes. The size of the semicircle, which is a measure of charge transfer resistance, is in the increasing order of Nb-CoS1.0365 < Nn-CoS1.0365 < BNr-CoS1.0365, which is in line with the order of conductivity exhibited by the electrodes. It should be noted in Fig. 7b that the charge transfer resistance of the Pt and the Nb-CoS1.0365 are more or less similar suggesting that they can have a similar electrocatalytic performance in DSSCs. To further characterize the charge-transfer properties of the I−/I3− couple on the electrode surface, we conducted Tafel polarization measurements on the same cells used for EIS measurements (Fig. 7c). These results are in good agreement with the CV and EIS results. The degree of their catalytic activity towards reduction of triiodide can be evaluated using Tafel plots. The slope of Tafel polarization curves, which is a measure of exchange current densities of the CoS1.0365 electrodes, is in the order of Nb-CoS1.0365 > Nn-CoS1.0365 > BNr-CoS1.0365, in Fig. 7c, indicating their catalytic activity in the same order. This order is in line with order of conductivity and charge transfer resistance of the film shown in Fig. 6 and 7b, respectively. Based on these properties, finally a real practical performance of the CoS1.0365 film as a counter electrode in a DSSC was evaluated by measuring the photovoltaic performance. Fig. 7d shows the characteristic J–V curves of the DSSCs with the CoS1.0365 and Pt films as counter electrodes, and the details of the photovoltaic profile obtained from the J–V curves are tabulated in Table 1. As expected, DSSCs having Pt and Nb-CoS1.0365 films as counter electrodes have demonstrated a highly competitive photovoltaic performance. It is worth noting that the degree of solar to electric power conversion efficiency of the various CoS1.0365 film counter electrodes are also in the same order as in the case of conductivity and the charge transfer resistance. The Pt counter electrode based cell exhibited a solar to electric power conversion efficiency of 7.70% with a short circuit density (Jsc) of 18.26 mA cm−2, an open-circuit potential (Voc) of 0.65 V and a fill factor (FF) of 0.65. Similarly, the Nb-CoS1.0365 film exhibited the best counter electrode performance among all three CoS1.0365 film electrodes with a power conversion efficiency of 7.40%, Jsc of 18.06 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.65 V and FF of 0.65. The above photovoltaic performance suggests that the CoS1.0365 nanorod film fabricated by the currently used ion exchange approach can be a potential candidate for substituting the expensive Pt counter electrodes.

Conclusions
The present work has successfully demonstrated a relatively low temperature solution based ion exchange mediated strategy for constructing 1-D arrays of a porous CoS1.0365 nanorod film from analogous 1-D arrays of a Co3O4 film derived from pyrolysis of a wet chemically synthesized cobalt hydroxycarbonate nanostructured film. The CoS1.0365 nanorods exhibit the existence of electrical conductivity and electrocatalytic activity towards reduction of triiodide ions. The degree of electrocatalytic activity was found to be in the same order as that of the conductivity and charge transfer resistance of the nanorod films. When used as a counter electrode in DSSCs, the nanorod film exhibiting the best electrocatalytic activity has demonstrated a highly competitive photovoltaic performance to that of the universally used standard Pt film counter electrode. This finding suggests the present strategy as a low cost deposition method to facilitate the application of non-precious metal-free counter electrodes in high performance DSSCs.
