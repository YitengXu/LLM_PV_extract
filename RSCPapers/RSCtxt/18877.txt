    , Accepted 26th March 2018First published on 28th March 2018AbstractA comprehensive study of the internal absorption, charge recombination and collection in HC(NH2)2PbI3 (FAPbI3) perovskite solar cells (PeSCs) with poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT) and 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenyl-amino)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) as the hole transport layers (HTLs) is presented. The optical simulation shows that the optical-field distribution and internal absorption of the perovskite layer are different in the cavity region for wavelength > 500 nm in PeSCs with HTLs of P3HT and spiro-OMeTAD. The transient photo-current (TPC) and photoinduced charge extraction by linearly increasing voltage (photo-CELIV) investigations reveal that the charge recombination in PeSCs is much better restrained by using spiro-OMeTAD as the HTL. The light intensity dependent J–V performance indicates that spiro-OMeTAD is more favorable for efficient charge collection due to its suppressed charge recombination. These results manifest that the HTL can affect the internal absorption of the perovskite layer, and the spiro-OMeTAD HTL is beneficial for reducing the recombination and enhancing the charge collection in PeSCs.
1. Introduction
Novel perovskite solar cells (PeSCs) based on solution-processed organometal halide thin films have attracted unprecedented interest from the photovoltaic research community in recent years due to the strong light absorption, bipolar transporting ability, balanced electron and hole diffusion length and low charge recombination rate of perovskite materials.1 PeSCs are typically made as a stack of materials including FTO/ITO glass, an electron transport layer (ETL), a perovskite layer, a hole transport layer (HTL), and a metal electrode.2–7 Where, the perovskite layer acts as the light absorber, which is responsible for all charge generation in PeSCs, and photo-generated electrons should migrate through the ETL to the electrode, while holes should migrate through the HTL to the counter electrode for effective charge extraction. Therefore, it is not only the perovskite layer itself, but also the ETL/HTL that extracts and transports charges and plays a crucial role in the performance of PeSCs.
Many efforts have been made to achieve better performance of PeSCs by engineering the hole transport layers.8–14 And some reports focus on the influence of HTL on the physical dynamics of charge carriers in PeSCs. This indicated that suitable HTL/perovskite energy level alignment,15–17 enhanced physical contact between the perovskite and HTL,18–20 and high hole mobility of the HTL21–23 can improve the hole transportation from the perovskite layer to the HTL, leading to suppressed charge recombination and facilitated hole collection in PeSCs. For example, Ahmadi et al. reported that the photoinduced dipoles in the HTL can decrease the photogenerated charge recombination in the perovskite layer and charge accumulation at the electrode interface in PeSCs.24 Kudriashova et al. reported that the fast component of charge recombination is assigned to the interface trap between the lead halide perovskite and charge transport materials, and the slow one to the bulk charge recombination.25 Li et al. reported that the chemically modified graphene oxides can passivate the surface traps at the perovskite/HTL interface, which reduced the interfacial recombination and enhanced hole extraction.26
However, literature provides limited details of the influence of HTL on the optical properties, especially the photon absorption of the perovskite layer in PeSCs. Usually the power conversion efficiency (η) of PeSCs can be factored into some distinct basic solar cell properties, i.e., η = ηP × ηCG × ηCT × ηCL(1)where ηP is the efficiency of photon absorption (Q); ηCG is the charge generation efficiency; ηCT is the charge transport efficiency; and ηCL is the subsequent charge collection efficiency in the perovskite layer across the interface to the external circuitry. The photon absorption (photogeneration of excitons in the perovskite layer) is the initial stage in the transformation of light into electricity. For PeSCs, the light absorption and reflection can induce strong interference effects of each layer, which can affect the internal absorption in the perovskite layer where most excitons are generated and the incident light power extinguished. Thus, it is critically important to take the interference of coherent reflected and transmitted waves at interfaces, as well as the HTL thickness, into account for the internal absorption with different HTLs.27 In addition, the optical field distribution in the perovskite layer is not simply Beer–Lambert due to the cavity interference originating from the reflection of the back electrodes. In this case, the optical field distribution strongly depends on the incident wavelength and is governed by the optical characteristics of the device stack, i.e., the complex index of refraction (n + ik) and the thickness of all layers.28 Hence, various HTLs can affect the optical field distribution in the perovskite layer, and consequently, affect the internal absorption of the perovskite layer.29 This is the reason why the photon absorption process can't be ignored when discussing the charge dynamics.
The following process after photon absorption is the conversion of the absorbed photons to free charge carriers (charge generation process); and the next step is that photogenerated charge carriers must be transported to their opposite contacts without charge trapping and recombination, and then the charge carriers are collected at the electrodes. In PeSCs, the combined factors of photon absorption, charge generation, transport, recombination and collection are intertwined, and all these processes can limit the device performance. Importantly, the HTL mainly functions by facilitating the transportation of holes from the perovskite layer to the electrode,30 which can affect the charge transport, recombination and collection processes. However, there is still a lack of combination study and lucid argument following the effect of HTLs on the internal absorption, charge recombination and collection in PeSCs.
In this work, the internal absorption, charge recombination and collection in PeSCs based on HC(NH2)2PbI3 (FAPbI3) with P3HT and spiro-OMeTAD as hole transport materials are investigated systematically. The transfer matrix method (TMM) was used to model the internal absorption (Q) of the FAPbI3 layer, accounting for the optical interference effects of different HTLs. The internal quantum efficiencies (IQE) of photocurrent within PeSCs were calculated from the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra and internal absorption spectra of perovskite layers. It is found that the internal absorption of perovskite layers was different for wavelengths above 500 nm in these two devices. And the PeSC with a HTL of spiro-OMeTAD possesses a significant improvement in IQE, indicating more photocurrent loss in the device with P3HT as the HTL. The charge recombination dynamics of PeSCs with P3HT and spiro-OMeTAD HTLs are analyzed using the combination of the transient photocurrent (TPC) and photoinduced charge extraction by linearly increasing voltage (photo-CELIV) techniques. In addition, the charge collection process was investigated by light intensity-dependent current density–voltage (J–V) measurements. They showed that the high performing PeSCs with a HTL of spiro-OMeTAD benefit from the combined effects of (1) enhancement of internal absorption, (2) suppression of charge recombination and (3) improvement of charge collection. We hope that the detailed analysis of the physical process will allow us to deeply understand the opto-electronic properties of PeSCs.
2. Experimental
2.1 Materials
The ZnO nanoparticles were prepared according to the work of Janssen et al.31 Lithium salts (>99.0%) were purchased from Aldrich. Lead iodide (beads, −10 mesh, 99.999% trace metals basis), HC(NH2)2I (>98.0%) and spiro-OMeTAD (2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis-(N,N-di-4-methoxyphenylamino)-9,9′-spirobifuorene, >99.0%) were purchased from Xi'an Polymer Light Technology Corp. (PLT). We will hereafter denote this spiro-OMeTAD as Spiro. P3HT was purchased from Rieke Metals. Ultradry solvents: N,N-dimethyl formamide (DMF, >99.9%) and isopropanol (>99.9%) were obtained from J&K and Acros, respectively. All the chemicals and solvents were kept in a glove-box before starting our experiment.
2.2 Device fabrication
Pre-patterned indium tin oxide (ITO)-covered glass substrates were cleaned for about 20 min in detergent followed by ultrasonic cleaning in deionized water, acetone, and 2-propanol in sequence for 20 min each. Then the ITO substrates were treated with plasma for about 5 min. The ZnO solution was spin-coated on ITO substrates at 1500 rpm for 50 s, followed by baking at 150 °C for 15 min. A 460 mg mL−1 solution of PbI2 in DMF with TBP (120 μL TBP in 1 mL DMF) was then spin-coated on the top of the ZnO layer at 4000 rpm for 30 s in the glove-box. The PbI2-coated ZnO thin film was then annealed at 70 °C for 10 min. The film was preheated at 100 °C for 3 min before dipping into a FAI 2-propanol solution (15 mg mL−1) for 20 s followed by annealing at 145 °C for 15 min to obtain the desired crystallite formation.
As a hole-transporting material (HTM), a Spiro solution (80 mg of Spiro, 10.5 μL of 4-tert-butylpyridine (tBP), and 46.5 μL of a lithium bis(tri-fluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Li-TFSI) solution (170 mg Li-TFSI/1 mL acetonitrile) in 1 mL chlorobenzene) was spin-coated at 4000 rpm for 30 s and a P3HT solution (15 mg mL−1 in chlorobenzene) was spin-coated at 3000 rpm for 30 on the HC(NH2)2PbI3. The substrates with HTMs were left overnight in dry air in the dark at room temperature. Finally, 80 nm thick Ag was thermally evaporated through a shadow mask defining an active area of 0.04 cm2 on the top of the HTL to produce a complete PeSC device.
2.3 Device characterization
The current–voltage characteristics of the solar cells were measured by using a computer-controlled Keithley 2400 source meter measurement system with an AM 1.5G filter at a calibrated intensity of 100 mW cm−2 illumination, as determined using a standard silicon reference cell (91150V Oriel Instruments). EQE spectra were measured in air under short-circuit conditions using a commercial EQE setup (Crowntech QTest Station 1000AD), which was equipped with a 100 W Xe arc lamp, filter wheel, and monochromator. Monochromated light was chopped at a frequency of 80 Hz and photocurrents measured using a lock-in amplifier. The setup was calibrated against a certified silicon reference diode.
For the transient photocurrent measurements, the devices were illuminated from the ITO side by a 10 ns pulse width laser flash (Continuum Minilite TM Nd:YAG, 10 Hz repetition rate) at 532 nm. The light intensity on the sample varies under a series of optical density filters. The devices were connected to the 50 Ω input terminal of an oscilloscope.
The CELIV set up consists of a pulsed laser (Continuum Minilite TM Nd:YAG), a synthesized function generator (Stanford Research System DS345), a digital delay generator (Stanford Research System DG645), and an oscilloscope (Tektronix MSO 4054) for signal observation and recording. Photo-CELIV measurements are carried out under ambient conditions, and samples are irradiated through the ITO side by a 10 ns, 532 nm laser flash. The linearly increasing voltage with an offset voltage (Uoffset) of 0.4 V and a maximum voltage (Umax) of 3.6 V (P3HT PeSC), and Uoffset = 0.6 V and Umax = 3.4 V (Spiro PeSC) is applied to the device, while the Ag electrode is grounded. The chosen Uoffset exactly compensates for the built-in potential (Vbi) of the devices, thereby nulling the internal electric field before the charge carrier extraction.
2.4 Thin film characterization
The thicknesses of ITO, ZnO, FAPbI3, P3HT, Spiro and Ag layers were estimated using a Veeco Dektak 150 surface profilometer.
The reflectance and transmittance spectra were measured with a Shimadzu UV-3600 spectrophotometer between 300 and 900 nm with a 1 nm increment.
Ellipsometry measurements were carried out with a Horiba Jobin Yvon UVISEL 2 ellipsometer at incident angles of 70° for photon energies between 0.6 and 6 eV with a 30 meV increment. The ZnO, Spiro and P3HT films were prepared following the aforementioned processes except for using clean Si wafers as the substrate. It should be noted that the FAPbI3 films were prepared on the substrate of Si/ZnO, in order to keep the FAPbI3 films same as that in the devices. Modelling of the data was performed using Deltapsi2 software by HORIBA Scientific Company. Before the films were measured, the bare silicon oxide layer was measured, and a thickness of 2 nm was obtained. All measurements were done at room temperature (∼298 K).
Steady-state fluorescence spectra were measured on a Shimadzu RF-5301PC spectrophotometer. Time-resolved photoluminescence (TrPL) spectra were obtained on a PL spectrometer (Edinburgh Instruments, FLS 980), excited with a picosecond pulsed diode laser (EPL-375). A Hamamatsu C5680-04 streak camera was used for TPL. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on a Rigaku SmartLab X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å) at 25 °C. The data were collected with a 0.01° step size (2θ). A field emission scanning electron microscope (Hitachi SU8020) was used to acquire SEM images.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 
          J–V characteristics of the perovskite solar cells
PeSCs were fabricated with the FAPbI3 perovskite layer as the absorber, ZnO as the ETL, and P3HT and Spiro as the HTLs. In the optimized PeSCs, a ∼50 nm P3HT thick HTL, ∼150 nm thick Spiro, ∼17 nm thick ZnO and ∼275 nm thick perovskite layer were employed. Fig. 1a shows the PeSC device configuration, and Fig. 1b shows the energy level diagram of the PeSC devices based on a P3HT or Spiro HTL. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of P3HT (−5.0 eV) or Spiro (−5.2 eV) is sufficiently higher than that of the FAPbI3 perovskite absorber ensuring efficient extraction of hole charge carriers at the HTL/FAPbI3 interface.

The J–V characteristics of PeSCs with the HTL of P3HT and Spiro measured under AM 1.5G illumination (100 mW cm−2) are shown in Fig. 2a. The cell parameters obtained for both types of cells are summarized in Table 1. It can be found that Spiro PeSCs possess obviously better performance than P3HT PeSCs, with increases in short circuit density (JSC) from 20.61 mA cm−2 to 21.88 mA cm−2, open circuit voltage (VOC) from 0.99 to 1.05 V, and fill factor (FF) from 65.23% to 74.62%, leading to an overall 28% increase in PCE from 13.31% (P3HT device) to 17.08% (Spiro device). And the evident enhancements in FF are the primary factor contributing to the superior performance of Spiro PeSCs.

The PeSCs with the Spiro HTL has a lower series resistance (RS) of 4.18 Ω cm2 and a higher shunt resistance (RSH) of 1637.14 Ω cm2 as compared to RS of 9.99 Ω cm2 and RSH of 807.89 Ω cm2 measured for P3HT PeSCs. RS and RSH in PeSCs are associated with the charge transport and extraction at the perovskite/HTL interface, affecting the FF of the device. The series resistance of the PeSCs with the P3HT HTL is higher than that for Spiro PeSCs due to the change of the FAPbI3/HTL interface and HTL/Ag interface. Since the ZnO/FAPbI3 interface has no difference between the two devices, we ascribe this increase to the contact between the FAPbI3 layer and Ag layer. The cross-sectional SEM images of PeSC devices with HTLs of P3HT and Spiro were obtained, as shown in Fig. 2. In addition, top-view SEM images of the perovskite film and P3HT and Spiro films on the perovskite layers are shown in Fig. S3.† Although the thin HTL of P3HT is clearly visible (Fig. 2c), the P3HT capping layer can't completely cover the perovskite film, as shown in the Fig. S3b.† Clearly, the landscapes of the perovskite surface could be also observed for the P3HT sample, leading to a reduced physical contact between the perovskite film and P3HT layer.32 In some regions on the P3HT HTL, the electrode Ag layer could contact the perovskite layer directly. Less reduced physical contact gives rise to high contact resistance. The HTL of Spiro improves the surface coverage, avoiding direct contact between the perovskite film and Ag electrode, which effectively increases the hole transfer paths and reduce the series resistance of the device. All of these improved electrical properties of the PeSCs with the Spiro HTL are also beneficial for JSC and FF enhancement. In Fig. 2b, the effect of HTLs on the dark J–V curves was observed. The Spiro devices show enhanced injection at larger bias,33 due to the improvement of the contact quality of the perovskite/HTL interface, leading to a significant reduction of the leakage current. It should be noted that the lowest current density of Spiro PeSCs under dark conditions is not at 0 V. When compared with the dark current density of PeSCs with HTLs of P3HT doped with Li-TFSI and pristine Spiro (Fig. S2b†), we found that the lowest dark current density is not at 0 V for both Li-TFSI doped Spiro and pristine Spiro PeSCs devices. But this behavior was not observed for two types of P3HT PeSCs. Therefore, the reasonable mechanism of observable current–voltage distortions should originate from the chemical reaction between spiro-OMeTAD+ and migrating I−.34 During operation, the positive voltage can cause the iodine ion I− to migrate to the perovskite/Spiro interface and then I− intercalates into the Spiro layer. As a result, a significant amount of I− is accumulated in the Spiro layer. When the applied voltage approximates the value of the built-in potential, there is no electric field within the device to drive I−, which causes the lowest current density under dark conditions at around 0.5 V. However, if the applied voltage is lower than the value of the built-in potential, the built-in potential can drive I− to drift toward the ITO electrode, to form a current cycle, leading to the lowest current density not at 0 V.35
3.2 Optical properties
The performance of PeSCs is largely governed by the incident photon to converted electron efficiency, thus the incident light that is absorbed by the perovskite layer is a limiting factor of device performance. To understand the influence of HTLs on the optical properties of the two PeSCs, the optical field distribution in PeSC devices for four wavelengths was determined by the transfer matrix optical model (TMM),27,29 and the effect of HTL thickness was also considered, as shown in Fig. 3. The optical constants (refractive index n and extinction coefficients k) for all layers in the device through spectroscopic ellipsometry measurements are shown in the Fig. S1.† Immediately, there are two different regimes of optical field distribution behavior for both PeSCs: (1) for wavelength < 500 nm, the optical-field distribution follows the Beer–Lambert law (exponential dependence of the field on the propagation distance) and no optical field reaches the FAPbI3/HTL interface due to the high absorption coefficient (Fig. S2†). In this case, the absorption is saturated and no optical interference occurs; (2) for wavelength > 500 nm, the optical field can reach the FAPbI3/HTL interface and is governed by the low-finesse cavity interference. Thus, the different amplitudes of the optical field in the perovskite layers for the two optimized cells with HTLs of 50 nm P3HT and 150 nm Spiro are affected by both the complex index of refraction and the thickness of the HTL.
 Fig. 3  Optical-field distribution in PeSC devices for four wavelengths with HTLs of P3HT 50 nm (a) and 150 nm (c) and Spiro 50 nm (b) and 150 nm (d). 
Since light harvesting in the perovskite layer is closely related to the electric field distribution and intensity within the device, the electric field intensity profiles versus wavelength and the FAPbI3 position in the optimized PeSC devices with HTLs of P3HT and Spiro were simulated, as shown in Fig. 4a and b. For both devices, a strong absorption is observed in the spectral range between 300 nm and 450 nm, which coincides well with the absorption peak of the perovskite films. However, it's obvious that the electric field is significantly different for wavelengths between 600 nm and 850 nm. To further analyze the effect of HTL on the electric field, the light absorbance in the active layer of devices (Q) is calculated and shown in Fig. 4c. The Q spectra of FAPbI3 layers are almost the same for wavelength < 500 nm in these two PeSCs, but for wavelength > 500 nm, the Q spectra are strongly dependent on the HTL because of the different optical interferences and thicknesses of the HTL. The value of the integrated Q spectra for Spiro PeSCs is 1.036 ± 0.008 times larger than that for P3HT PeSCs calculated based on five samples for each type of device, which means the perovskite layer can absorb a few more excitons in Spiro PeSCs than P3HT PeSCs. In addition, the HTL has a subtle but important influence on the exciton generated in the FAPbI3 layer as shown in Fig. 4d. Most of excitons are generated very close to the ZnO/FAPbI3 interface due to the strong absorption of the perovskite. As such, a reasonable number of excitons are dissociated at the ZnO/FAPbI3 interface, and electrons can be collected by the ZnO ETL before they recombine. In the innermost 150 nm of the perovskite film, the generation of excitons mainly originated from the wavelength > 500 nm, which was affected by the cavity interference, and thus there is a diverse distribution of excitons between P3HT and Spiro cells. Accordingly, the HTL has a remarkable impact on the internal absorption of the perovskite layer, which can further affect the exciton generation in PeSCs.

3.3 Experimental EQE and calculated IQE
The EQE of PeSCs, the ratio of the number of charge carriers collected by the PeSCs to the total number of incident photons, provides information on the light absorption in the perovskite region contributing to the photocurrent, as shown in Fig. 5a. The Q spectra correlate very well with the measured EQE spectra including the spectral shapes and amplitudes (Fig. S4†). In order to analyze the underlying mechanism about the internal quantum efficiency of the photocurrent, more quantitatively, eqn (2) is helpful: ηEQE = ηA × ηIQE(2)where ηA is the exciton generation efficiency (the ratio of the absorbed photon number to the total incident photon number in the perovskite layer), which should be the same as Q; ηIQE is the internal quantum efficiency (IQE) (the ratio of the number of extracted electrons converted from the current to the number of photons absorbed in the perovskite layer). Thus, IQE (Fig. 5b) can be easily calculated from the experimental EQE and calculated Q spectra,29 as shown in the equation below: (3)
 Fig. 5  (a) Experimental EQE spectra and calculated IQE spectra of PeSC devices with HTLs of P3HT and Spiro. 
The calculated photocurrent and the experimental one (typically JSC) are listed in Table 2. It should be noted that JSC estimated by J–V curves is approximately 11% larger than the JSC calculated from EQE, which is a little larger than the JSC values obtained from the TMM, because the laser size in EQE characterization is smaller than the actual size of the PeSC's active surface area. We assume that the IQE is 100% when calculating the photocurrent using the TMM, which means all photons absorbed in the perovskite can convert to charges collected by electrodes, and the calculated JSC of Spiro cells was only about 3.6% higher than that of P3HT cells. However, the experimental JSC of Spiro cells was 6.2% (J–V curves) and 7.1% (EQE) higher than those of P3HT cells. The differences of the experimental JSC between the Spiro cell and P3HT cell were larger than those of the calculated JSC, indicating that there is a reduction of IQE and thus a decrease of charge collection efficiency due to more significant charge recombination loss in P3HT cells, as verified in Fig. 5b.

3.4 Charge recombination dynamics
To get further insight into the effect of HTL on charge recombination in PeSCs, the charge recombination process is analyzed by excitation-intensity-dependent transient photocurrents (TPCs) and photo-CELIV techniques. The TPC traces of PeSCs based on P3HT and Spiro HTL are shown in Fig. 6a. The TPC traces of both cells show a clear dependence on the excitation intensity. The values of the initial peak increased with increasing the excitation–intensity, and the TPC saturated at a relatively high excitation–intensity (the whole TPC traces of the two devices are shown in Fig. S5†), but the decay of TPC traces was quite different. The initial peak current values of transient photocurrents and t1/e (the time needed until the current value reduced to 1/e of its prompt peak current value) of the transient photocurrents as functions of the excitation–intensity are calculated, as shown in Fig. 6b and c. The peak current values of these two PeSCs show almost the same trend. The values linearly increase at lower excitation intensity and saturate at higher excitation intensity, and the values of the initial peak current are quite similar with various excitation intensities. The linearly increasing initial part at lower intensity reflects that the peak values are proportional to the number of photo-generated charges,36 which is reliable because the charge photo-generation is very efficient in these two PeSCs, as shown in Fig. 5b. However, there is a significant difference of t1/e between the two PeSCs. The t1/e value of the transient photocurrent mainly depends on the charge carrier extraction process affected not only by the charge transportation, but also the charge recombination process. The t1/e values of Spiro cells are clearly higher than the values of P3HT cells with various excitation intensities, which suggests that the charge recombination of Spiro cells was lower than that of P3HT cells, or the charge transportation from the perovskite to the electrode in Spiro cells was slower than that in P3HT cells. However, much higher hole mobility of Spiro than P3HT was obtained using SCLC as shown in Fig. S6,† which means that the longer t1/e originated from the lower charge recombination, instead of the slower charge transfer from the perovskite to the electrode in Spiro PeSCs.

The insightful investigation about charge recombination dynamics for the two PeSCs was realized through the photo-CELIV technique. In the photo-CELIV measurement, a laser pulse is introduced to generate photo-carriers. An offset bias is first applied to compensate the built-in potential, forcing the charge carriers to remain in the device and recombine. After an adjustable delay time of the laser pulse, the remaining charge carriers are then extracted at a linearly increasing voltage pulse with a voltage rising speed A = dU/dt. Fig. S7† presents the schematic illustration of the photo-CELIV method.37–40 The charge mobility (μ) can be calculated using eqn (3) as given below:41,42 (4)where d is the interelectrode distance, tmax is the time at the maximum extraction current, j(0) is the initial current step and the Δj is the extraction current. The photo-CELIV transients recorded at various delay times are shown in Fig. S8.† The carrier mobility results, calculated using eqn (3) at a delay time of 20 μs, show that the effective charge mobility μ in the device with the Spiro HTL (7.2 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) is a little higher than that of the P3HT device (4.1 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1).

Fig. 7 shows the time-dependent charge carrier density and the fitting curves as a function of delay time for PeSCs with HTLs of P3HT and Spiro (detailed process of fitting is shown in ref. 39). The charge carrier density decreases with the increase of the delay time since the charge carriers are forced to recombine for both devices. The solid lines show a satisfactory fit to our data, and the initial density n0, the recombination lifetime τ and the dispersion parameter γ were obtained from the fitting, as shown in Table S2.† The density of total extracted charges decreases with the increase of the delay time for both PeSCs, which reflects that the longer the delay time applied, the less the photogenerated carriers collected due to the recombination process. For P3HT PeSCs, the charge density exhibits a much faster decay as the delay time increases. The higher n(0) value suggests that PeSCs with the Spiro HTL can generate more free charges, which is consistent with the higher JSC observed. The prolonged recombination lifetime τ of Spiro cells indicates that the photo-generated charge carriers can survive much longer without recombination.

3.5 Charge collection efficiency
The charge recombination and collection in PeSCs are competitive processes depending on the effective internal electric field. Fig. 8 shows the light intensity-dependent JSC and VOC plotted in double logarithmic scales, and the intensity-dependent J–V curves are shown in Fig. S9.† The relationship between the photocurrent density (J), the VOC of PeSCs and the light intensity (I) can be expressed as J ∝ Iβ(5) (6)where β is the power law dependence on light intensity, q is the electric charge, α is the ideality factor, k is the Boltzmann's constant and T is the temperature. It can be seen that the values of the exponent β obtained are both 1.0 for these two PeSCs, indicating that under this condition, the recombination is dominated by the first-order (monomolecular) mechanism.47 It should be noted that if the PeSCs exhibit relatively high efficiency, most of the photogenerated charges are swept out of the device prior to recombination at short circuit and collected as photocurrent in the external circuit. The measurement of light intensity-dependent photocurrent at short circuit is not ideal for the study of recombination.43 The detailed information of the charge recombination in these two PeSCs can be further improved by analyzing the light intensity dependent VOC characteristics. Because there is no photocurrent generated under the condition of open circuit, the charge recombination process in PeSCs can be examined for the devices operated near VOC. Fig. 8b shows that VOC varies logarithmically (ln(I)) with light intensity. A trap-free PeSC relationship should have a slope of . The slope of  implies significant Shockley–Read–Hall recombination prevalent in P3HT PeSCs. The slope value significantly reduced to  for Spiro PeSCs, indicating that trap-assisted recombination is reduced in the device,44,45 which is consistent with the photo-CELIV result.

Fig. 9 shows the photocurrent density (Jph) as a function of the effective applied voltage (Veff) across PeSCs, which were double logarithmically plotted. The Jph and Veff are defined as Jph = Jillumination − Jdark(7)where Jillumination and Jdark are the current densities under illumination and in the dark; Veff = V0 − Vapp(8)where V0 is the voltage when the photocurrent is the minimum (Jillumination = Jdark), and Vapp is the value of the applied bias.
 Fig. 9  Double logarithmic plots of photocurrent density as a function of light intensity measured for PeSCs with HTLs of (a) P3HT and (b) Spiro at different effective voltages. 
According to previous studies,46Jph ∝ Iβ, the power law dependence of Jph on I can be obtained. β = 1 means all photogenerated charges are swept out prior to recombination, and β less than 1 could originate from the charge bimolecular recombination. The power exponent β of Spiro PeSCs are about 1 over the broad effective internal potential range from 0.17 V to 1.22 V, corresponding to devices being operated under the short-circuit (Veff = 1.22 V), maximum power output (Veff = 0.34 V), and near open-circuit (Veff = 0.17 V) conditions. This suggests that almost all of the photogenerated charges are collected without charge accumulation, resulting in a higher photocurrent density in Spiro devices. The power exponent β obtained for P3HT PeSCs decreases with the effective internal potential, and the values of β were 1 at Veff = 1.22 V, 0.99 at Veff = 0.34 and 0.98 at Veff = 0.22 V. As the charge mobility is field dependent, less efficient charge transport and collection in P3HT PeSCs would occur at low Veff, leading to the accumulation of space charges that gives rise to higher recombination. The smaller exponent value β indicates stronger recombination in P3HT PeSCs, leading to poor charge transport and collection.
The photocurrent density (Jph) versus effective voltage (Veff) plots, which can estimate the effect of HTL on charge collection under operating conditions, are shown in Fig. 10. The Jph–Veff curves are limited by the first-order (monomolecular) recombination from the short circuit condition (Veff = 1.22 V) to the maximum power point (Veff = 0.34 V), and evolve to the second-order (bimolecular) recombination47 for voltages ranging from the maximum power point to the open-circuit condition. When Veff was large enough, almost all the photogenerated charges could be collected by the respective electrodes. While at lower Veff, charge recombination would increase and not all the photogenerated charges could be collected. Under specific Veff, charge collection efficiency ηcc can be calculated47 using (9)
 Fig. 10  Double logarithmic plot of Jph–Veff characteristics for PeSCs with HTLs of P3HT and Spiro. 
The calculated ηcc probability at three effective voltages is shown in Table 3. It is obvious that the ηcc probability of Spiro PeSCs is always higher than that of P3HT PeSCs due to the reduction of charge recombination loss.

The photocurrents become independent of the applied voltage and saturate at higher Veff. At a high Veff of 1.22 V, ηcc approaches unity and gives rise to almost 100% collection of the photogenerated charges for both PeSCs. However, at the maximum power output (Veff = 0.34 V), the ηcc of P3HT PeSCs was only 82%, which was much lower than that of Spiro cells. For P3HT PeSCs, the ηcc decreases from 82% at Veff = 0.34 V to 65% at Veff = 0.17 V, while only a 10% drop in ηcc from 94% (at Veff = 0.34 V) to 85% (at Veff = 0.17 V) occurs in Spiro PeSCs, which confirms that Spiro PeSCs possess more efficient charge collection due to the suppression of the charge recombination.
During the device preparation, HTLs were deposited on the top of all other layers, so we assume that the bulk recombination and recombination on the perovskite/ZnO interface was the same for P3HT and Spiro devices. Therefore, the entirely different behaviors of charge recombination and collection mainly occur at the interface between FAPbI3 and HTLs46 in the two PeSCs, which can be explained by the interfacial defects and built-in potential (Vbi). The interfacial defects for perovskite layers with different HTLs were analyzed using the steady state photoluminescence (SPL) spectra shown in Fig. 11a. The perovskite with the Spiro HTL had a blue-shifted PL peak compared to the P3HT sample, which indicates that Spiro can more efficiently passivate the trap states close to the perovskite/HTL interface than P3HT.48 The preferable interface reduces the number of holes caught by trap states, leading to more hole injection to the HTL. Thus, the photoluminescence density of the perovskite film with Spiro is lower than that of the film with P3HT. In addition, the charge extraction behavior of different HTLs was further dynamically verified by time-resolved photoluminescence (TPL) spectroscopy. Fig. 11b shows the decay dynamics of PL intensity for perovskite with different HTLs. The lifetime of PL signals (τ1 and τ2) was thus obtained by exponentially fitting the dynamic curves. The shortest PL lifetime of the perovskite with the Spiro HTL confirms that the photoinduced hole transfer between the perovskite and Spiro is faster than that between the perovskite and P3HT.49 The charge extraction efficiency which is controlled by the properties of the HTL material is one of the factors to determine the charge collection efficiency. Thus, the rank order of PL quenching efficiency, i.e., Spiro > P3HT, is coincident with the rank order of ηcc of the corresponding PeSCs. In addition, the presence of energetic barriers at contacts can play a detrimental role in charge collection. The magnitude of the energetic barriers is dependent on the electrodes and the HTL with different work-functions and band gaps.50 The lower energetic barriers can give rise to the enhancement of device Vbi (Fig. S10†), which can increase the electric field strength, resulting in faster charge extraction and increased charge collection. The combination of these two effects explains the observed drop in the charge recombination and enhanced charge collection of Spiro PeSCs.

4. Conclusions
The comprehensive study of internal absorption, charge recombination and collection in FAPbI3 PeSCs with HTLs of P3HT and Spiro was performed by using the TMM, light intensity dependent J–V characteristics, TPC and photo-CELIV techniques. Different HTLs can affect the internal absorption and exciton generation distribution in perovskite layers. The effect of the Spiro HTL on the suppression of charge recombination and the improvement of charge collection efficiency in PeSCs is clearly demonstrated. As a result, a better FF is achieved in PeCS with a Spiro HTL. These results contribute towards the understanding of the detailed physical process inside PeSCs and can provide information relevant to HTL materials design/selection procedures for high performance PeSCs.
