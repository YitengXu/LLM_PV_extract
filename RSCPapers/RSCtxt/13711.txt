    , Accepted 21st September 2022First published on 21st September 2022AbstractThe photopolymerization synergistic thermal polymerization process has been successfully applied in the preparation of very opaque composites. In this work, the fabrication of opaque few layer graphene (FLG) composites was accomplished by an enhanced dual photo/thermally initiated photopolymerization process under LED@405 nm irradiation and in an open (to air) system. A significant improvement of the depth of cure (Doc) can be observed compared to the solely photochemical approach. Furthermore, the kinetics of the curing thickness was examined in detail, importantly, it was possible to obtain customized products with desired thicknesses by varying the time. In addition, scanning electron microscope (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) were used to access the homogeneity of the composites, and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) were used to examine the thermal and mechanical properties of the composites. Finally, the formulation was also employed successfully for 3D printing/direct laser write experiments.
Introduction
High-performance polymer composites have been a long-standing pursuit in academia and industry because of their benefits and applications in advanced technologies.1–4 The initial motivation for the preparation of polymer composites, was the desire to prepare materials with specific properties that exceed those of neat polymers.4–6 As the understanding of polymer chemistry and physics as well as materials science has deepened, a higher demand for polymeric materials with tailoring properties has been raised, i.e., to further investigate the relationship between the properties–structure–composition, etc. of the material.7–9 In recent decades, a great amount of fundamental research has emerged, both in the preparation methods of polymer composites and in the molding and processing of materials.
In general, more research focus are given to the improvement of the performance of polymeric materials, such as the traditional mechanical properties (Young's modulus, toughness, elongation) and thermal properties (e.g. decomposition temperature, glass transition temperature (Tg)), as well as imparting higher electrical conductivity for conductive polymers, the increase of power conversion efficiency for solar cell or battery materials, or antimicrobial properties as antibacterial materials. etc.10 Certainly, the enhancement of these properties is also related to the variety of fillers and materials, including (but not limited to) metal, liquid metal and semi-metal oxides (e.g. iron, silica, titania, alumina, iron oxide),11–13 semi-conductors (quantum dots),14,15 carbon-based materials (carbon black, graphite, graphene derivatives)16–18 and various synthetic and natural clays.19,20 Throughout these, graphene or more likely few layer graphene (FLG) as a filler for composites can in turn impart further properties to polymeric materials like extraordinary mechanical, physical and electrical properties.10,21–25
For the challenges for high-end preparation of graphene's, and reduced graphene oxides we want to refer to more specialist studies for example of Munief et al.24,25 dealing with the detailed analysis of the materials obtained by improve hummers method and the development of the low temperature exfoliation and desalination (LTED) protocol for ultrathin layers on microchips. In this work, they propose a “green” and very sample method allowing a total dispersion of the FLG (from a commercial and available carbon material) directly in the monomer using an ultrasonic treatment in the presence of a surfactant (tannic acid).
As far as graphene-based polymeric nanocomposites basing on such filler materials are concerned, their preparation techniques mainly consist of in situ polymerization (including by heterogeneous polymerization methods), traditional physical mixing (melt processing, solution blending, etc.) and emulsion-based techniques that have appeared in recent years,10,26–28 each of which have their advantages and disadvantages. But due to the existence of problems such as inhomogeneity and low compatibility, thus, it is challenging to prepare homogeneous polymer nanocomposites without aggregation and restacking.10,29,30 It is well known that the photocatalytic and photoinitiated polymerization has made great progress due to its excellent spatial and temporal control, mild conditions, etc.31–40 Therefore, its 3D printing technology (mainly referring to VAT photopolymerization) is also highly preferred due to its low cost, fast speed of response, and the ability to accomplish rapid and mass production of customized structures.41–46 However, the preparation of such FLG composite is hardly done by photopolymerization process because it is hindered by problems such as light penetration. However, different from well-known preparation technique, we have recently demonstrated that polymerization of opaque resins (high iron filler content) can be achieved directly by a photopolymerization process,13 which enables the fabrication and printing of metal composites with thick curing depths by combining charge transfer complexes which feature lower thermal initiation temperatures.47–49
Here, we also utilized a direct photo-polymerization enhanced thermo-polymerization synergistic process to accomplish the preparation of opaque graphene-based composites. Specifically, we selected the two monomers, trimethylolpropane triacrylate (TMPTA) and Di(trimethylolpropane) tetraacrylate (TA). A formulation containing FLG (2% and 4%, wt%, FLG characterization see Fig. S1 and S2, ESI†) was prepared, see ESI.† 2-Benzyl-2-(dimethylamino)-4′-morpholinobutyrophenone, Irgacure 369 (2.5 × 10−5 mol g−1) as photo initiator (PI 369) and the charge transfer complex (CTC, 5.5 × 10−5 mol g−1-Scheme 1) were added to the formation resulting in a dual photochemical/thermal initiating system. In addition to real-time Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (RT-FTIR) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), we investigated in detail the thickness kinetics of both composites, i.e., depth of cure versus time using thermal imaging camera through temperature-time plots as a basis. A series of characterizations using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) allows to verify the homogeneous distribution of the material; thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) leads to information about the thermal and dynamic mechanical properties of the materials. Such analyses were performed for composites with different contents of filler, and finally the FLG formulations were also field-tested by applying to 3D printing to generate some macroscopic three-dimensional patterns.

Results and discussion
It is well known that PI 369 is an excellent photoinitiator commercially available, and CTC also has some photoinitiating capability, but for the opaque formulations, the photoinitiating ability of both is poor due to the limited light penetration. First of all, we tested the photo induced initiating performance of PI 369 and CTC under the irradiation of LED@405 nm light source (110 mW cm−2) with 0.5% FLG formulation, respectively. For thick samples (2.5 mm), the expected results of no conversion could be verified since light cannot penetrate. As shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†), in thin samples (25 μm), almost all conversions are below 30%, except initiation curve by CTC in TA with 0.5% FLG. Under these conditions only using CTC even outperforms PI 369 CC conversion. On the other hand, the irradiation can heat the sample due to the absorbance of photons by the FLG. Interestingly within the conversion curves of the formation consisting of CTC, filler, and TMPTA, Fig. S3 (ESI†), a transition from a pure photo to a combined mechanism of photo and thermal induced polymerization can be assumed. The curve firstly follows the behavior of only PI containing formulations before a significant increase at around 90 s. A thermal effect can also explain the outstanding performance of the TA, CTC, filler containing.
To prove this theory, we examined the reactions without light only by heat using a DSC device. We found for both formulations (TMPTA or TA with 5.5 × 10−5 mol g−1 CTC, see Fig. 1A and B) a thermal initiation temperature below 100 °C (onset temperature: 75 °C for TMPTA, 82 °C for TA) and that the kind of used monomer type has an effect on the thermal polymerization performance. For thermal polymerization, high final acrylate function conversions (FC) of the multifunctional monomers could be calculated as presented in the ESI† (67% FC for poly(TMPTA) and 62% FC for poly(TA)). For such multifunctional systems a full solidification is verified. This behavior which also makes it easier to achieve thick sample preparation in practice.47 The pure monomer without CTC, nearly no polymerization occurs below 150 °C.
 Fig. 1  Thermal polymerization experiments using CTC (5.5 × 10−5 mol g−1) for (A): TMPTA; (B): TA (heat flow vs. temperature) measured by DSC, heating rate: 10 K min−1, under N2. The plots of temperature versus irradiation time monitored by thermal imaging camera: (C) TMPTA with various wt% FLG in the absence/presence of PI 369; (D) TA with various wt% FLG in the absence/presence of PI 369 (2.5 × 10−5 mol g−1). 
Next, we examined the temperature of the reaction under the irradiation of LED@405 nm at 1 W cm−2, Fig. S4 (ESI†), A, which is approximately 10 times higher than the irradiation used for the FTIR experiments. 2% and 4% of FLG contents were selected for the initial attempts. The reaction process of both formulations (FLG filler based TMPTA or TA with/without 2.5 × 10−5 mol g−1 PI 369, details see the caption of Fig. 1C and D) was monitored by thermal imaging camera and the temperature versus irradiation time was plotted separately. The temperatures in the TMPTA and FLG-containing formulation (2% or 4%) without the presence of photoinitiator, Fig. 1C, was higher than the ones of the pure monomer (0%, black line). The difference in temperature after final stabilization is about 15–18 degrees, but the samples are not solidified. No significant polymerization could be observed. Therefore, the heat released is mainly ascribed to the heater effect of the FLG fillers that convert light to heat. However, in the case of the TMPTA formulation with 2% FLG containing the photoinitiator PI 369, there was initially a more intense exotherm in the uppermost part, due to the polymerization, reaching a temperature of 147 °C (red line), but it could not continue to initiate the photoreaction in the deeper layers, so gradually the surface temperature stabilized at a final 105 °C. In the case of the TMPTA formulation with 4% FLG, the temperature rises gradually to 105 °C (orange line), which is about 30 °C higher than the pure monomer temperature. Similarly, we can also observe a similar phenomenon in the TA, where all the curves show an increasing trend and finally relatively stable, as shown in Fig. 1D.
We then tested whether CTC is effective in increasing the photocuring depth in the presence of an additional photo initiator (PI 369), especially in the resin with FLG filler. Considering that the final temperature that can be reached is above the thermal initiation temperature of CTC, the thermal polymerization is theoretically possible. We used a reaction/illumination time of 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, (12) minutes in order to examine the evolution of the final depth of cure (Doc). From Fig. 2, the combination of PI 369 and CTC in both the TMPTA and TA containing formulation improve of the curing depth very significantly under exposure of fixed 10 min, with an enhancement of 27 times in poly(TMPTA) compared to the pure photochemical process (blue bar vs. black bar, Fig. 2A), and also compared to CTC alone, with an improvement of about 4.5 times (red bar). A similar phenomenon was observed in poly(TA) in Fig. 2B, for with the higher thermal initiation onset temperature explains the smaller Doc in comparison to the TMPTA containing formulations.
 Fig. 2  DoC results under different formulations for the FLG-based composites for 10 min of irradiation of LED@405 nm (1 W cm−2). All polymerizations were performed at PI 369 (2.5 × 10−5 mol g−1 in monomer) and/or a CTC (5.5 × 10−5 mol g−1 in monomer). 
Further, it is necessary to understand the kinetics of the depth of cure if we want to obtain a polymerized product with customized thickness. As shown in Fig. 3A, the combination of PI 369 and CTC increases the curing depth very well, and by repeating the tests, within the margin of error, we can infer an increase in thickness (from 1 mm to over 60 mm within 10 min) at different time intervals and can observe a rate-increasing effect on the heat propagation. The curing thickness of the 4% FLG formulation is slightly lower than that of the 2% FLG formulation in the same time. The thicknesses of the cured products can also be effectively tuned by varying and extending the time as demonstrated for the TA formation (from 10 to 12 min) due to the slightly later thermal polymerization, with a relatively better linear relationship in the 2% FLG formulation, as shown in Fig. 3B. Of cause the linear behavior can only be expected in a limited range. The reaction itself will be a self-limited grow (S-shape) due to light penetration, heat conductivity/transfer and loss. These experiments successfully demonstrate the feasibility of our strategy to fabricate pan-scale polymeric products, from thin to thick.

(A) DoC results for TMPTA resin; (B) DoC results for TA resin. 
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were used to observe the microscopic morphology of the produced composites.50 As Fig. 4 represents the composite containing 4% graphene, a good dispersion of graphene was found in the generated photocomposites, both in poly(TMPTA) and in poly(TA). From the cross-sections (4A and C) and surfaces (4B and D), the overall profile is relatively well distributed, with the polymer wrapped around the filler, and no significant voids are found. SEM images of the composites with 2% FLG are shown in ESI,† Fig. S5. We know that graphene as well as graphene oxide are less well dispersed with most polymers, so the preparation of homogeneous materials without aggregation and restacking of polymeric nanocomposites is difficult. Moreover, we also performed an energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) analysis of the sample surface, which was very homogeneous, and the percentage of elemental C concentration was 41.5–42% for the pure Ploy(TMPTA) product and between 54–62% for the composites containing 2% FLG, also indicating the increase in C content and the homogeneity of the surface, without agglomeration of fillers, which is also observed in poly(TA), as shown in Fig. S6A–D (ESI†). We deduce that the homogeneous distribution is attributed to 2 points, on the one hand, the low content of our FLG fillers in the prefabricated dispersion, and on the other hand, the relatively fast polymerization and curing rate.

In order to investigated if the presence of graphene filler enhance the thermal stability of the composite, TGA experiments were carried out (Fig. 5 and Fig. S7, ESI†). The temperature of the maximum decomposition rate Tmax (enlarge region) was shifted toward higher temperatures (around 10 °C) due to the presence of graphene (for Poly(TMPTA), from 458 to 470 °C, and for Poly(TA), from 425 to 435 °C). This result shows that even a small addition of FLG can still affect (improve) the thermal stability of the polymer matrix. The mechanical properties of these strongly crosslinked products were not improved in the presence of graphene fillers as assessed by dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA). Specifically, the storage modulus (G′, also named as elastic modulus) of the corresponding photocomposites showed a decrease with increasing FLG content (Fig. S8, ESI†), indicating that the stiffness (rigidity) of the samples is diminishing, which indicates that the samples become less elastic during reversible deformation. The interaction of well-dispersed graphene with the polymer matrix however decreases the constraint of the polymer chain segments in the network. It can be seen that the storage modulus of the composite with poly(TMPTA) as the main composition, containing 2% FLG content, is 155 MPa (corresponding to a G′ value of 167 MPa for poly(TA)), and further decreases to 142 MPa for 4% content (corresponding to a G′ value of 114 MPa for poly(TA)).

As one of the 3D printing techniques, three-dimensional patterns are generated by direct laser writing (DLW) on composites with different FLG contents. Even with a FLG content of 4%, 3D patterns can be obtained by the DLW process under air using laser diodes @405 nm. As shown in Fig. 6, using the formulation of PI 369 and CTC (see ESI† for details) and adjusting writing time, the high reactivity of the FLG-filled resin (TMPTA) allows a very efficient light-curing process in the irradiated area, obtaining thick patterns up to 1.3 mm in Z axis in a short printing time (<3 min for 2 cm long patterns) and showing excellent spatial resolution (∼50 μm in the size range of the laser beam). TA resin containing FLG was also successfully printed, and the overall 3D structure is better, despite slight defects in some parts, see ESI,† Fig. S9 (ESI†).

Conclusion
In conclusion, we demonstrated that the preparation of opaque composites can be achieved by a photopolymerization synergistic thermal polymerization process through the combination of a photo initiator even with poor absorbance for the used illumination and a charge transfer complex (thermal initiator) with a potential low thermal initiation temperature. This opaque model resin was a dispersion of 2 and 4% FLG in acrylic monomers which successfully produced 25–35 times thicker composites than the same formation without thermal initiator in the same time (10 min under mild conditions of LED@405nm irradiation). The kinetics of the curing thickness was also investigated in detail, showing in the investigated time range a near linear relationship of the time dependence of the curing depth which makes the preparation of pan-scale polymeric products based on our findings possible. SEM and EDX experiments demonstrated the homogeneity of the composites without re-stacking. TGA showed an elevated thermal stability of the composites, while DMA showed a certain degree of reduction in sample stiffness. Finally, 3D printing was successfully applied to the formulation of the FLG filler, yielding high-resolution 3D patterns, albeit at a low thickness. We believe that the synergistic photothermal process can complement the pure photochemical approach to prepare additional polymer composites.
