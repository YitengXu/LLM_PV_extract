    , Accepted 7th February 2023First published on 8th February 2023AbstractPerovskite photodetectors have excellent photodetection properties in the visible range, but the operation stability of the related devices is still questionable for next-stage commercialization. In this work, a series of representative structurally-related ammonium salts is selected to form solution-processed Ruddlesden–Popper (RP) quasi-two-dimensional (quasi-2D) perovskite photodetectors. We find that the stacking distribution and crystallinity of the low-dimensional components can be effectively tuned with the phenyl and alkyl structures as well as the chain length, so as to significantly affect the photo-sensing abilities. With the optimal butylamine (BA) spacer, a high-quality quasi-2D perovskite film featuring a well-aligned energy cascade is realized to facilitate charge separation as well as photoconductive gain, resulting in a record high detectivity of 5 × 1012 Jones, a fast rise/fall time of 3.6/35 μs and prolonged ambient and operational stability. The stability analysis indicates that the dark current level increment is the essential feature to affect the reliability of perovskite photodetectors, and it can be well-suppressed by quasi-2D components that can restrain the ion-migration doping. This work opens a pathway to high sensitivity and stable perovskite photodetectors, as well as to understanding the degradation mechanism in photodetection devices.
Introduction
Organic–inorganic halide perovskites are experiencing unimaginable development in terms of both scientific discovery and industrial application in the area of optoelectronic devices. Along with research interest on photovoltaics1–3 and light-emitting diodes (LEDs),4 the recent progress has unveiled great potential in light detection technology with working wavelength ranging from X-ray to ultraviolet, visible and near-infrared.5,6 In particular, with the advantages of low-cost solution processability, tunable bandgap, efficient direct-bandgap absorption and high tolerance to defects, the perovskite photodetectors are considered as the most promising alternatives to the traditional silicon photodetectors in the visible range. With their excellent photoelectronic conversion ability, the benchmark performance of sub-picowatt per cm2 illumination detection7 and sub-nanosecond response speed8 has been achieved in perovskite photodetectors, with a series of demonstrations from imaging9 to bio-sensing,10 optical communication,11 laser ranging,12 and flexible and wearable applications with self-assembled nanowire structures.13–15 Nevertheless, the stability issue, i.e. performance degradation upon ambient exposure amplified by continuous illumination or biasing, which is being intensively investigated in photovoltaics,16,17 and LED regimes,18 is still rarely addressed in perovskite photodetectors.
With the introduction of large organic cations into cubic three-dimensional (3D) organometal halide perovskites, stacking layered two-dimensional (2D) perovskites with a high formation energy and suppressed ion migration can be formed19,20 to significantly improve material stability. Especially, the solution-processed thin-film quasi-2D perovskites with mixed dimensionality-changed crystalline components have attracted great research interest in photovoltaic devices, as a promising material panel to reach a balance between high power-conversion-efficiency and good stability.21 A series of investigations to reveal the effect of stoichiometric tunable dimensionality and molecular structures on the light-harvest properties was performed in quasi-2D perovskite solar cells.22–24 For perovskite photodetectors, the dimensionality analysis of the general photo-sensing abilities such as sensitivity and response speed was initially performed in polycrystalline thin-films,25 and size-limited single crystals,26,27 respectively. A recent study further revealed that the distribution of low-dimensional crystalline components can be tuned with dimensionality, resulting in heterojunction stacking to facilitate the photodetection abilities.28 Unlike the stoichiometrically-changed dimensionality, molecular engineering is a more efficient route to control the low-dimensional composition in quasi-2D perovskite films without significantly affecting the light absorption and charge transfer properties, and it was previously illustrated in photovoltaic and LED devices.23,24,29 For perovskite photodetectors, to establish the relationship between crystalline structure and photodetection key parameters/stability and molecular engineering, it is of particular importance to find a material system addressing both the sensitivity and stability issues, ultimately contributing to industrial commercialization.
In this work, a series of representative structurally-related ammonium salts with phenyl and alkyl groups was selected to form solution-processed Ruddlesden–Popper (RP) quasi-2D perovskite films with whole visible range absorption (n = 4). The both-side photoluminescence spectral analysis revealed that the stacking distribution of low-dimensional components can be effectively tuned with the molecular structure and carbon chain length. With a simple photoconductive device scheme, the iconic photo-sensing figures of merit were respectively characterized and compared for the quasi-2D perovskite films with different ammonium spacers, showing a close correlation with the composition distribution. With the optimal butylamine (BA) spacer, a high-quality quasi-2D perovskite film featuring a well-aligned energy cascade was realized to facilitate charge separation, photoconductive gain and prolonged stability. A high detectivity of 5 × 1012 Jones and a fast rise/fall time of 3.6/35 μs were achieved, which are among the best reported performances of quasi-2D perovskite photoconductors. Both the ambient and operational stability were monitored and compared to those of the 3D analogue, showing that the dark current level increment is the essential feature to affect the reliability of photo-sensing devices. The ion migration characterized by photoluminescence (PL) imaging microscopy indicates that the dark current level increment is associated with ion/defect doping driven by the external electric field, which can be well-suppressed by the quasi-2D perovskite components.
Results and discussion
Methylammonium lead iodide (CH3NH3PbI3, MAPbI3) was chosen as the standard cubic 3D organometal halide lattice to form the layer-stacked Ruddlesden–Popper quasi-2D perovskites.24,28,30,31 The resulting RP quasi-2D perovskites can be described with the formula R2MAn−1PbnI3n+1 (n = 1, 2, 3, 4…), where R is the large ammonium spacer cation.32 Three ammonium spacers of propylamine (PA), butylamine (BA) and phenethylamine (PEA) were selected as the representative material panel to study the influence of the molecular structure (with phenyl and alkyl) and the alkyl chain length on the film composition as well as the photodetection properties of the RP quasi-2D perovskites. To ensure good whole-visible-range absorption similar to that of the 3D components, the precursor ratios of different spacer cations were fixed at n = 4 (i.e. R2MA3Pb4I13) to form the spin-deposited RP quasi-2D perovskite thin films on glass substrates with the hot-casting method.33–36

Fig. 1a–c shows the top-view scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the as-deposited quasi-2D perovskite films with different ammonium spacers, all resulting in a full-coverage close-packed pinhole-free film made of micrometer-scale crystalline grains. The average grain size was respectively evaluated in the three samples, and it was found that the BA-based quasi-2D perovskite has the largest grain size of 1.7 μm, compared to the other samples with grain sizes of 1.3 μm and 1.4 μm. The cross-sectional SEM images of the quasi-2D perovskite films with different spacers are shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). Unlike the bulky-crystallized 3D perovskite film, layer-stacked crystalline structures can be observed across the quasi-2D films, indicating the existence of low-dimensional components. X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurement was conducted to explore the crystallinity of the different quasi-2D perovskite films and the patterns are shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†). As observed in previous reports,16 the diffraction peaks of the quasi-2D perovskites with n = 4 are similar to those of the 3D components, dominated by the (111) and (202) facets. The BA-based film shows the highest XRD peaks with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) value of 0.15° (facet of (111)), indicating optimal crystallinity. Whereas, the diffraction peaks of the PA-based film are obviously lower than the others with a FWHM of 0.25° (facet of (111)), indicating that the alkyl ammonium salt with a short chain length may lead to poor crystallinity of the RP perovskites.26,37

The absorption and photoluminescence peaks of different dimensions are marked with dash–dot lines. 
To investigate the optical properties, the absorption spectra of different quasi-2D perovskite films were measured and compared to that of a normal spin-deposited 3D film, as shown in Fig. 1d.38,39 The absorption edges of the quasi-2D films are all blue-shifted compared to the 3D one, with clearly observed exitonic absorption peaks of the low-dimensional components. For the PEA-based film, the absorption edge is closer to that of the 3D spectrum, indicating a larger distribution of 3D components (refer to the stacked absorption spectra in Fig. S3, ESI†). The absorption spectra of the BA- and PA-based films share similarity in their multiple exitonic peaks, while the exitonic peaks of the BA-based film are stronger, indicating better crystallinity and confinement of the low-dimensional phases. Both-side PL spectral analysis is a powerful tool to reveal the composition distribution of different quasi-2D perovskite films. Fig. 1e shows the PL spectra of different quasi-2D films, with the pumping light illuminated on the top-surface, showing one dominative PL peak in all samples. The PL peak of the PEA-based film coincides well with that of the 3D film with the central peak wavelength of 781 nm, indicating that the composition in the upper part is dominated by 3D components. For the BA-based film, the FWHM of the PL peak is broadened, with the central wavelength of 775 nm and the decay edge overlapping with that of the 3D film, indicating a multi-composition of large n-value and 3D components in the upper part. The composition distribution in the lower part of the quasi-2D films can be analyzed with the PL spectra acquired with pumping light illuminated on the bottom-surface (from the glass side), as shown in Fig. 1f. For the PEA-based film, the spectrum is dominated by a strong PL peak with the central wavelength around 513 nm, which corresponds to the n = 1 (2D) component by comparing to the published results.37,40 For the BA-based film, besides the PL peak around 775 nm, a general distributed PL peak with central wavelengths of 580 nm, 614 nm, 648 nm, and 674 nm can be observed, respectively corresponding to the n = 2, n = 3, n = 4 and other components by matching with previous reports (details are summarized in Table S1, ESI†).34,35,41,42 The PA-based film has a broad PL spectrum similar to the BA-based film, while the PL intensity of the low-dimensional components is much weaker, which further corroborates the relatively lower crystallinity. Based on the PL spectral analysis, we can get some insights into the composition stacking structures of different quasi-2D perovskite films. The PEA-based film is more like a bi-layer stacked structure formed with n = 1 and 2 (mainly 2D) components distributed more in the lower part and the 3D component distributed more in the upper part. Whereas, the BA-based film has a generally dimensionally-changed distribution from n = 2 to 3D components stacking from the lower to the upper part. The composition distribution of the PA-based film is similar to the case of the BA-based film, but with lower crystallinity. The composition stackings in the PEA- and BA-based samples were further explored by grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) characterization, with different grazing incidence angles to reveal the crystallinity information at different depths of the films. As shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†), no low-dimensional peaks appeared at the 0.5 degree incident angle for both samples, which confirms that 3D components dominate the surfaces. A low-dimensional composition diffraction peak of the PEA-based film was observed at a 4 degree incident angle, which cannot be observed in the BA-based film. The different composition stacking structures could be related to the different molecular structures of the ammonium spacers adopted. As the BA molecule has a long alkyl chain, in contrast to the relatively “rigid” molecule of PEA with a phenyl chain, the BA based quasi-2D perovskite prefers to form a highly ordered crystal orientation structure with a multiple phase distribution.43
A simple photoconductive device structure was utilized to correlate the structure composition of the different quasi-2D perovskite films with their photodetection abilities. As shown in Fig. 2a, the quasi-2D perovskite films were directly spin-deposited on glass substrates with pre-patterned interdigitated Cr/Au electrodes, to monitor the conductivity change with illumination level. A bottom-illuminated scheme was adopted for photo-sensing characterization, as it provides more composition stacking information (based on the PL spectral analysis above), and weakens the variations caused by film thickness between different samples. The thickness of the different quasi-2D perovskite films was calibrated by a step profiler and the data are summarized in Table S2 (ESI†). Fig. 2b shows the typical current–voltage (J–V) curves of the different quasi-2D perovskite films in the dark and under white light illumination (AM 1.5G). The forward and reverse J–V sweep curves of the different devices are shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†), showing negligible hysteresis in the BA-based devices and a slight asymmetrical response in the PEA-based devices related to ion migration. The BA-based device demonstrated the optimal performance with the lowest dark current and highest light current levels. The dark current level of the PA-based device was one order of magnitude higher than the BA-based sample, which can be attributed to the lower crystallinity and smaller grain size of the PA-based perovskite film. For the PEA-based device, the increment trend of dark current is different from the others, being well-suppressed below 5 V bias, but significantly increased with a higher bias. This can be correlated to the bi-layer structure of the PEA-based film, as the electric field is initially applied to the low-conductive 2D component at low bias, then into the whole film at high bias.

(b) Typical current–voltage curves of different quasi-2D perovskite photodetectors in the dark and under white light illumination. (c) Spectral responsivity, (d) spectral specific detectivity and (e) light intensity dependent responsivity (at 525 nm) comparisons of the different quasi-2D perovskite photodetectors. (f) The detailed transient photocurrent decays and the whole response curves (inset) of the different quasi-2D perovskite photodetectors to a square-wave modulated light source (525 nm, 1.0 mW cm−2 illumination level). The samples in (c–f) were all characterized at a 20 V bias. 
The wavelength-dependent external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the different photoconductors was characterized to investigate the origins of the photocurrent. As shown in Fig. 2c, the BA-based device shows a broad photo-response across the whole visible range with photoelectronic conversion efficiency up to 60% (EQE illumination was calibrated at a power of ∼0.1 mW cm−2), which is generally twice that of the other samples. We further analyzed the EQE spectra of the different quasi-2D perovskite photoconductors by comparing them with that of a normal 3D perovskite photoconductor fabricated on the same pre-patterned substrate, as shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†). Compared to the flat spectral response of the 3D-based device, an EQE reduction in the short wavelength range (below 550 nm) can be observed for all the quasi-2D perovskite-based devices, and it is most prominent in the PEA-based sample. As short wavelength light, with a shallow penetration depth, is mainly distributed in the lower part of the quasi-2D perovskite film under bottom illumination, the EQE reduction can be related to inefficient light absorption and charge transfer of the bottom-stacked low-dimensional components with spacer barriers. Especially, for the PEA-based device exhibiting the lowest photo-response, the strong quantum confinement of the 2D component in the bottom layer may be attributed to a large bi-molecular recombination loss, which further reduces the charge separation rate, as well as the photocurrent generation. This can be verified with the predominant PL intensity of the n = 1 component observed in the bottom-illuminated PEA-based film, in contrast to the weak PL signal of the other samples with generally-distributed components (an absolute value comparison of PL spectra is provided in Fig. S7, ESI†).
Based on the EQE spectra, the corresponding spectral responsivity (R) of the different quasi-2D perovskite photoconductors is shown in Fig. S8 (ESI†). Together with the noise current level evaluated from the dark current, the wavelength-dependent noise-equivalent-power (NEP) and specific detectivity (D*) of the different samples were also calculated and are respectively shown in Fig. S9 (ESI†) and Fig. 2d. The optimal BA-based device achieves the highest specific detectivity of 5 × 1012 Jones (cm Hz1/2 W−1) and the lowest NEP of 4.4 × 10−14 W Hz−1/2,44–46 which are among the reported most sensitive quasi-2D perovskite photoconductors based on single crystals and polycrystalline films (a detailed comparison is provided in Table 1). As the photo-response abilities of photoconductors are normally highly dependent on the illumination level,28,47 we further calibrated the responsivity of the different quasi-2D perovskite photodetectors under different illumination levels. As shown in Fig. 2e, the responsivity of the BA-based device reached 4.4 A W−1 under 27 nW cm−2 illumination, corresponding to 1042% EQE. This means that the sensitivity of our device can be further enhanced under low illumination levels, as a large photoconductive gain dominates the photo-response.48 The light intensity dependent responsivity of the PEA-based device is saturated at around 0.8 A W−1 below ∼260 nW cm−2 illumination, indicating that the maximum photoconductive gain is achieved. Finally, as the important figure of merit to evaluate the operation bandwidth of a photodetector, the temporal response of the different quasi-2D perovskite photoconductors was measured, as shown in Fig. 2f, with a square-wave-modulated light source. We observed that the BA- and PA-based devices show similar response curves, while the PEA-based one is different, wherein a slow trapping and de-trapping process can be observed in the rise and fall curve (a detailed rising curve comparison is shown in Fig. S10, ESI†). We evaluated the response speed of our devices with the rise/fall time, with rise time being the time difference between the 10% and 90% points of the peak amplitude on the leading edge of the pulse, and fall time being the time difference between the 90% and 10% points of the trailing edge of the pulse. The evaluation results are summarized in Table S3 (ESI†). The rise/fall time of the BA-based device was evaluated to be 3.6/35 μs, which is a record fast response speed among the previously reported polycrystalline quasi-2D perovskite thin-film photoconductors (Table 1). The rise/fall time of the PEA-based device was evaluated to be 5.2/95 μs, with the falling time obviously longer than the other cases. This may be attributed to the more dominant trap-assisted recombination in the transient response with the large recombination loss in the PEA-based film.47,49

Based on the PL spectra and the photo-sensing ability analysis, simplified schematic models of the composition stackings of the PEA- and BA-based quasi-2D perovskite films are illustrated in Fig. 3a and b. It should be noted that the models only reflect the stacking trends of the different compositions. Different phases are not necessarily parallel-stacked and they could be interlaced with each other in a general case. The corresponding energy diagrams of the photoconductors, as well as the photo-generated charge distributions, are illustrated in Fig. 3c and d. The energy levels were taken from previous publications.28,34,35,41 For the PEA-based device with a bi-layer heterojunction structure, the short-wavelength light (below 550 nm) is mainly absorbed by the strongly-confined 2D (n = 1) component at the bottom part, resulting in a large recombination loss and limited contribution to photocurrent generation. The absorption of the 3D components mainly in the upper part contributes to the most photocurrent, with the photo-generated holes transferred to the low-dimensional components. The holes distribute more in the 2D component near the Cr/Au electrodes, and circulate in the circuit driven by the external bias, until they recombine with the electrons distributed more in the 3D component. This results in a photoconductive gain mechanism,23 expressed by G = τtrap(e)/τransit(h), where τransit(h) is the transit time of the holes in the 2D component and τtrap(e) is the trapping time of the electrons kept in the 3D component.50 For the BA-based device with a generally dimensionally-changed distribution, a well-aligned energy cascade is realized, as shown in Fig. 2d. The photo-generated electron-hole pairs can be efficiently separated and transported with the energy shift between the dimensionally-changed components, resulting in the holes mainly accumulating in the n = 2 component and the electrons mainly accumulating in the 3D components. With the efficient spatial distribution of the electrons and holes in different parts of the perovskite film reducing the recombination rate, the trapping time of the electrons is prolonged, resulting in a higher photoconductive gain.

It is widely known that low-dimensional perovskite devices can demonstrate superior performance under the influence of water, oxygen and light illumination, etc.20 As shown in Fig. 4a–d, after exposure to ambient conditions for 216 hours, the 3D perovskite film exhibits a significant increase of PbI2 (around 12.6 degree) peaks in its XRD pattern, meanwhile the PA-, BA- and PEA-based films show negligible signals of PbI2 peaks. Note that, compared with the PA and PEA ones, the BA-based quasi-2D perovskite film shows no signal of PbI2 peaks, making it the most stable one. This is consistent with the observation of perovskite film images before and after exposure to air with 85% RH, as shown in Fig. S11 (ESI†).
 Fig. 4  (a–d) XRD patterns of the 3D MAPbI3 and different quasi-2D perovskite thin films exposed to ambient conditions with 60% RH. (e) Normalized light and dark current levels of the 3D and BA-based quasi-2D perovskite photodetectors without encapsulation vs. aging time. (f) Noise equivalent power (NEP) evolution of the unencapsulated 3D and different quasi-2D perovskite photodetectors, stored under ambient conditions with 60% RH. (g) Operational stability monitoring of encapsulated BA-based quasi-2D perovskite photodetectors under modulated illumination (λ = 525 nm, Ee ≈ 1.0 mW cm−2, Bias = 5 V). 
The ambient stability of the different perovskite photoconductors was investigated by monitoring the dark and light current levels with exposure time. Fig. 4e presents a monitored comparison of the 3D- and BA-based perovskite photodetectors both in the dark and under light after normalization (the original dark and light currents of the 3D-, BA-, PA- and PEA-based devices are shown in Fig. S12, ESI†). The light current of the 3D perovskite device slowly increases with exposure time, while that of the BA-based device is nearly unchanged after 144 h of ambient exposure. For the dark current, the 3D-based device shows a dramatic increase with exposure time, which is well-suppressed in the BA and other quasi-2D perovskite devices. That is, the dark current level increment is the essential feature to affect the reliability of photodetector devices, as confirmed by the corresponding NEP comparison shown in Fig. 4f. The BA-based device with the lowest NEP shows the best stability with a slight increment of 3.48 × 10−12 W Hz−1/2 after 144 h of ambient exposure. Besides ambient exposure, the stability of perovskite optoelectronic devices is greatly affected by illumination and bias stress.51 Therefore, we monitored the operational stability of encapsulated BA-based quasi-2D perovskite photodetectors under modulated illumination, as shown in Fig. 4g. In a test period of more than 22 hours with continuous illumination and bias, we observed negligible degradation with a light current level decrement from 1.14 μA to 1.12 μA and dark current increment from 2.2 nA to 4.3 nA. In contrast, for the 3D perovskite devices, as exhibited in Fig S13 (ESI†), light and dark currents are both doubled during the operation, which results in very unreliable signal sensing.
It has been accepted that both electronic and ionic transport dynamics are of importance for the performance of perovskite optoelectronic devices.52 To directly visualize the ion migration in a perovskite, PL imaging microscopy has been developed as a powerful tool to in situ investigate the ion related behavior of perovskites under an external electric field18,53,54 and optical field.55,56 Generally, PL imaging microscopy is performed based on typical confocal PL microscopy57,58 or wide-field PL microscopy59–61 to characterize the spatial distribution of PL intensity across the whole film. Fig. 5 shows the ion migration images of the quasi-2D and 3D perovskite films pumped and captured at the substrate side (at the bottom surface). Under a constant bias (20 V), the PL of the MAPbI3 3D perovskite film in the channel is quenched after only 1 second. As a contrast, (BA)2(MA)3Pb4I13 films deposited on glass present much more stable PL behavior under the same electric field, although there are still signs of degradation associated with ion migration after 12 seconds. These migrating ions, we have proposed, are dominated by iodine vacancies (VI).17,60 Combining the PL imaging results (Fig. 5) with the operational stability test data (Fig. 4g), the different behavior of dark current under continuous illumination and bias between MAPbI3 and quasi-2D perovskites is due to ion migration. In detail, these moving iodine vacancies with positive charges, acting as doping defects, significantly change both local PL properties and charge carrier density under the external electric field,62 leading to the increase of dark current of the device. Therefore, the spacer or ligand used to separate the Pb-I octahedral structure in the quasi-2D perovskite significantly suppresses ion/defect formation and migration,20 resulting in a much more stable photodetector performance. It is worth to mentioning that we also recorded ion migration images at the top surface of the BA-based perovskite film (Fig. S14, ESI†). As the high-dimensional phases are distributed more in the upper part of the BA-based film, ion migration occurs at a low voltage of 9 V (quenching front moves from the positive pole to the negative pole), which is lower than the driven voltage we observed in Fig. 5b (20 V). This is consistent with previous studies that reported that 2D components of perovskite significantly suppress ion migration inside.

Conclusion
In this work, we selected a series of representative structurally-related ammonium salts to form solution-processed RP quasi-2D perovskite films. The comparison of device performance among perovskites with different spacer cations indicates that the choice of large cations may greatly affect the composition and optoelectronic properties of layered organometal halide perovskite films. With the optimal butylamine (BA) spacer, a high-quality quasi-2D perovskite film with a well-aligned energy cascade is obtained, resulting in a high-sensitive fast-response and stable-operation photodetector. The stability test indicated that the dark current level increment is the essential feature to influence the reliability of photo-sensing devices, and may be associated with doping effects due to ion migration under an external optical/electric field. The spacer in the RP quasi-2D perovskite can suppress the ion migration, enhancing the stability of photodetector performance. Therefore, the RP quasi-2D perovskite provides a versatile platform to realize multiple parameter tuning in photodetection technologies for diverse applications as well as to address the stability issue for commercialization.
Experimental section
Solution preparation and device fabrication
Precursor solutions (1.5 M) of (PA)2MA3Pb4I13, (BA)2MA3Pb4I13 and (PEA)2MA3Pb4I13 were prepared by dissolving MAI (99.5%, Xi’an Polymer Light Technology), PAI, BAI, PEAI (99.5%, Xi’an Polymer Light Technology), and PbI2 (99.5%, Xi’an Polymer Light Technology) in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF; 99.8%, Sigma-Aldrich) with a molar ratio of 2:3:4. Precursor solutions (1.5 M) of MAPbI3 were prepared by dissolving MAI (99.5%, Xi’an Polymer Light Technology) and PbI2 (99.5%, Xi’an Polymer Light Technology) in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF; 99.8%, Sigma-Aldrich) with a molar ratio of 1:1. The glass substrate was ultrasonically cleaned sequentially in deionized water, acetone, and ethanol and dried under a stream of nitrogen gas. Cr (8 nm)/Au (50 nm) electrodes with a channel width (W) and length (L) of 2800 and 100 μm (interdigitated electrodes (18 periods)) were evaporated under a vacuum of <1 × 10−4 Pa. Using the hot-casting method during perovskite thin film fabrication, prior to the spin-coating, the substrate was exposed to O2 plasma for 25 min and preheated at 150 °C for 9 min. After that, 40 μL of precursor solution (70 °C preheating for 30 min before use) was dropped onto the preheated substrate followed by a one-step spin-coating process at 4000 rpm for 20 s.
Materials characterization
The absorption spectra of the perovskite films were recorded by a PerkinElmer UV-vis-NIR spectrometer. The composition and orientation of the perovskite layer were confirmed using XRD (D8-A25, Bruker). Scanning electron microscopy (SUPRA55 Sapphire, Zeiss) was employed to record perovskite film morphology. The PL spectra of the perovskite films were acquired using a photoluminescence spectrometer (FLS 1000, Edinburgh) with an excitation wavelength of 480 nm.
Optoelectronic measurements of the photodetectors: The photoresponse performance was scanned by a source meter (2400, Keithley) with a scan rate of 0.5 V s−1 under 1 sunlight (AM 1.5, 100 mW cm−2) from a solar simulator (SS-F5-3A, Enlitech) in a nitrogen-filled glovebox. The response speed of the photodetectors was measured using a transient photocurrent test. A light-emitting diode with a wavelength of 525 nm modulated by a square wave at the frequency of 37 Hz from an arbitrary function generator (AFG-2225, GW Instek) was used to illuminate the devices. The current was recorded by an oscilloscope with a sampling resistor of 50 Ω (InfiniiVision DSOX4024A, Keysight). The EQE spectra were measured by a Zolix external quantum measurement system (Omni-λ 3007, Zolix). An aging test of the MAPbI3 and the quasi-2D perovskites was carried out in an environment of 60% RH. The device was kept at room temperature (about 25 °C) and placed in the dark.
PL imaging microscopy
PL imaging microscopy was performed using a commercial microscope (FN1, Nikon). The perovskite films were excited by an optical excitation at a central wavelength of ∼470 nm. The PL signal was directed onto a high-speed charge-coupled device (CCD) camera (pco.pixelfly, PCO). A constant bias of 20 V was supplied across the electrodes using a Keithley 2612B sourcemeter unit. Meanwhile, the time dependent current was also monitored.
The formulas used to calculate the figures of merit for photo-sensing are listed as follows:6,11,73
The responsivity (Rλ) was calculated by Rλ = Iph/Pin, where Pin is the incident light power on the device sensing area, and Iph is the photocurrent generated by the device.
EQEλ was calculated by  where h is the Planck constant, λ is the wavelength of the incident light, c is the speed of light, and e is the elementary charge.
The noise equivalent power (NEP) was calculated by NEP = In/Rλ, where In is the current noise spectral density. The shot noise current of the device can be evaluated by in = (2eIDB)1/2, where ID is the dark current of the device and B is the noise measurement bandwidth. Therefore, the NEP and specific detectivity D* can be evaluated by:    where A is the sensing area of the devices.
