    , Accepted 2nd November 2020First published on 3rd November 2020AbstractThe design and development of non-precious metal catalysts with high activity and stability for overall water splitting remains a major challenge. Herein, lamellar FeNi3N incorporated by FeNi3 is synthesized via thermal ammonolysis. The abundance of hollow sites in this FeNi3–FeNi3N heterostructure significantly enhances the intrinsic activity towards hydrogen evolution reaction, while the heterostructure also offers high electrochemical active surface area for oxygen evolution reaction. FeNi3–FeNi3N enables a lower overpotential for both hydrogen and oxygen evolution electrocatalysis in alkaline media. When FeNi3–FeNi3N is employed as a bifunctional material for overall water splitting, it shows a cell voltage of only 1.5 V at 10 mA cm−2 and offers stable performance for up to 48 h at current densities of ∼40 mA cm−2.
Introduction
Electrochemical water splitting is a promising, sustainable technology to enable energy conversion and high purity hydrogen production. This is so significant since it can be a means to achieve comprehensive utilization of renewable resource-derived electricity.1 The efficiency of electrochemical water splitting depends primarily on electrode catalysts for both anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER).2–4 In typical acidic media, the electrode materials deployed until now are generally noble metal-based materials, which suffer from high overpotential, cost and vulnerability.5 On the contrary, although the output power of overall water splitting in alkaline medium is two orders of magnitude lower than that in acidic solution,6,7 the low overpotentials achieved on earth-abundant transition metal materials make overall alkaline water splitting more efficient and economical.
Nickel/iron based compounds (including alloys,11 layer double hydroxide,12 nitrides,13 oxides,14 sulfides,15 phosphides,16 carbides17,18) have been known to be active OER catalysts. Among these materials, the as-formed NiOOH site is commonly regarded as the active center, and the incorporation of Fe suppresses the oxidation of Ni2+; leading to Ni3+/4+ with more oxidizing power and thus resulting in faster OER kinetics.12,19–21 It is reported that the number of Ni2+ ions that get converted into Ni3+ ions (NiOOH) is equal to the number of Ni sites that actually catalyze the OER;22 this allows the accurate determination of density of active sites via a redox peak method.22 To futher simplify the electrochemical system and speed up the commercialization of alkaline water splitting, the efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts that simultaneously catalyze HER and OER in alkaline media is desirable.8–10 However, due to the inappropriate (either too strong or too weak) binding energy toward H+,23,24 the NiFe based materials still suffer from inferior HER activity;25 hence the preparation of possible bifunctional NiFe-based catalysts for efficient OER and HER remains a challenge.
Here, we describe a lamellar FeNi3–FeNi3N catalyst prepared using a facile hydrothermal method, followed by nitridation. The FeNi3N nanospheres are in situ formed and dispersed rather well on the surface of lamella like FeNi3 matrix during thermal nitridation. This gives rise to the formation of FeNi3–FeNi3N heterostructures at the interface of FeNi3N and FeNi3. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations indicate that some hollow sites that exist in FeNi3–FeNi3N heterostructures show a lower Gibbs free energy for adsorbed atomic hydrogen, and therefore it contributes to high activity toward HER. Simultaneously, the FeNi3N nanospheres enhance the number of accessible electrochemical active sites for OER, and hence dramatically increase the specific activity toward OER. For demonstrating practical use of FeNi3–FeNi3N catalysts – both HER and OER are run in alkaline media within a symmetric alkaline water electrolyzer. The electrolyzer is assembled using efficient FeNi3–FeNi3N as anodic and cathodic materials; the device displays a low overpotential with 1.5 V cell voltage at 10 mA cm−2 current density.
Results and discussion
The lamella like FeNi3–FeNi3N is synthesized through a facile two-step strategy. As shown in Fig. 1a; ferric nitrate and the nickel nitrate are first dissolved into the mixture of cis-9-octadecenylamine and butyl alcohol solvents to form a homogeneous solution. The collected NiFe hydroxide through hydrothermal treatment is then heat treated under ammonia flow to achieve nitridation.

The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of the FeNi3 in Fig. S1† matches well with that of FeNi3 alloy (PDF#38-0419). In addition to the FeNi3 alloy phase, cubic FeNi3N (PDF#50-1434)15,25 featured peaks at 41.52°, 48.34° and 70.81° are observed for the FeNi3N–FeNi3 sample annealed in ammonia at 460 °C (Fig. 1b). The Rietveld refined result suggests the ratio of cubic FeNi3N and FeNi3 crystalline phase is 22:78. The XRD patterns of samples calcined at different temperatures are shown in Fig. S2,† and it clearly shows that FeNi3 alloy would be gradually converted into FeNi3N with the increase of temperature. When the nitriding temperature is increased to 650 °C, only pure phase of FeNi3N is formed in Fig. S1.† The crystal structure is further confirmed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). For FeNi3 in Fig. S3b,† the lattice fringes with d-spacing of 0.18 and 0.20 nm correspond to the (200) and (111) plane of cubic FeNi3. After nitriding at a relatively high temperature of 650 °C for 2 h, the observed lattice fringes in the sample show a d-spacing of 0.22 nm, which is attributed to the (111) plane of cubic FeNi3N (Fig. S3d†). Correspondingly, both FeNi3 and FeNi3N featured lattice fringes are clearly observed in TEM images for FeNi3–FeNi3N (Fig. 1d). Their nano domains are adjacent with a discernible interface, clearly showing the formation of FeNi3–FeNi3N heterostructure.26–28 Investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) in Fig. 1e and S4,† similar to pristine FeNi3 alloy, FeNi3–FeNi3N maintains a lamella like morphology. However, the aggregation driven by high temperature leads to the transformation of morphology to sphere for FeNi3N.
Electrocatalytic activity of as-prepared catalysts for HER is evaluated in 1.0 M KOH using a typical three-electrode system. A high purity of graphite rod is used as the counter electrode. Commonly, the overpotential at current density of 10 mA cm−2 (η10) is taken as the reference for HER activity assessment. As shown in Fig. 2a, the HER overpotential of FeNi3–FeNi3N (51 mV) is closed to the value for Pt/C (40 mV), which in turn is far better than that in case of FeNi3N and FeNi3 nanocatalysts. And the overpotential (η) observed at 20 and 100 mA cm−2 is 86 mV and 215 mV respectively, which slightly higher than Pt/C (55 mV and 156 mV based on current densities). In the Fig. S5,† it can be seen that the performance of FeNi3–FeNi3N for HER decrease with increasing temperature, and the sample calcined at 460 °C is the best. Specifically, the HER overpotential (η) of FeNi3–FeNi3N outperforms many FeNi-based materials in Table S1.† Correspondingly, the Tafel slope in Fig. 2b of FeNi3–FeNi3N is 83 mV dec−1, which suggests the Volmer–Heyrovsky mechanism as the HER pathway, in which the Heyrovsky process (H2O + Hads + e− + →H2 + OH−) is the rate-determining step (RDS). Inversely, the higher Tafel slope of FeNi3 (182 mV dec−1) and FeNi3N (264 mV dec−1) indicates that the Volmer reaction dominates the HER kinetics.

Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) analysis is performed on at η = 70 mV. As depicted in Fig. S6 and Table S2,† the semicircle of FeNi3–FeNi3N in Nyquist plots indicates a charge transfer resistance (Rct) of 55.2 Ω, which is smaller than that of FeNi3 (67.4 Ω) and FeNi3N (238.4 Ω). The low Rct reveals that FeNi3–FeNi3N exhibits fast charge transfer rates, consistent with the HER activity. As shown in Fig. S7,† the double-layer capacitance (Cdl) is tested by the cyclic voltammetry method at different scan rate. Based on this, the corresponding calculated result listed in Table S2† suggests FeNi3–FeNi3N possesses the largest electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) of 7.1 m2 gcat−1.
To assess the kinetic barriers involved in HER, we have studied the effect of temperature on the performance of the catalysts (Fig. 2d and S8†). HER proceeds more rapidly at elevated temperatures, reflecting the exponential temperature dependence of the chemical rate constant. The Arrhenius plots at η = 100 mV for three different catalysts allow extraction of electrochemical activation energies (Ea). As shown in Fig. 2d, FeNi3–FeNi3N exhibit an Ea of 55.9 kJ mol−1, which is lower than that in case of FeNi3 (83.1 kJ mol−1) or FeNi3N (154.3 kJ mol−1). This result suggests the lowest apparent barrier for HER on FeNi3–FeNi3N heterostructures.
To better understand the reason for catalytic activity of FeNi3N, FeNi3 and FeNi3–FeNi3N heterostructure toward HER, density functional theory (DFT) calculations are used for constructing the correlative theoretical models (Fig. S15–S18†) and for calculating the free energy of H* (ΔG(H*)) on them (Table S3–S5†). Generally, a site with moderate value of |ΔG(H*)| ≈ 0 is most active for the HER.29,30 The most active sites for FeNi3N, FeNi3 and FeNi3–FeNi3N are portrayed in Fig. 2c. As shown in Fig. 2e, the corresponding Gibbs free energy diagram of HER reveal that the hollow sites H2 (Fe–Ni–Ni) and H3 (Ni–Ni–Ni) in FeNi3–FeNi3N possess the lowest |ΔG(H*)| value of 0.01 and 0.07 eV, confirming relatively more favorable H* adsorption kinetics on FeNi3–FeNi3N heterostructures during the HER process. In order to identify the effect of FeNi3–FeNi3N interface on electronic structure, charge density difference is calculated (Fig. S19†). Yellow and blue areas represent charge density increase and reduction, respectively. The electrons transferred from FeNi3N to FeNi3 leads to make the yellow areas are more close to FeNi3. The abundant charge accumulation on FeNi3 leads to a higher catalytic activity for FeNi3–FeNi3N interface than pristine FeNi3N or FeNi3. The stability of the HER catalysts is investigated using chronoamperometric measurement at a current density of 10 mA cm−2, continuously for 11 hours. As presented in Fig. S9,† FeNi3–FeNi3N shows an initial overpotential of 40 mV, which is same as that of the Pt/C electrode. And no appreciable increase in overpotential is observed in this time interval. While for Pt/C, there is an increase of 117 mV observed.
The OER polarization curves (Fig. 3a) collected via negative scan in 1.0 M KOH, shows an apparent peak at 1.30–1.40 V for Ni containing samples. This peak could be assigned to reduction of Ni3+ to Ni2+. And the OER current appears earliest at 1.44 V for FeNi3–FeNi3N. At the OER current density of 10 mA cm−2, an overpotential of 260 mV is needed for FeNi3–FeNi3N. By comparison, it is 280 mV, 270 mV and 370 mV for FeNi3, FeNi3N and IrO2, respectively. And in terms of the polarization curves in Fig. S10,† we can find the material calcined at 460 °C is the most favorable for OER. The FeNi3–FeNi3N with heterostructure exhibit the smallest Tafel slope of 53 mV dec−1 (Fig. S11†), clearly indicating faster reaction kinetics in this case.

It is commonly known that the NiOOH which is in situ formed during OER offers active sites in case of NiFe-based materials.12,19 Thus, in terms of the reduction peak of Ni3+/Ni2+, the accessible active sites of Ni can be quantified using turnover frequency (TOF) calculation.19,22,31 As shown in Fig. 3b, the reduction peak at range from 1.3 to 1.4 V is assigned to Ni3+/Ni2+.16 Compared to FeNi3 (0.185 mW cm−2) and FeNi3N (0.368 mW cm−2), the largest peak area of 0.618 mW cm−2 for FeNi3–FeNi3N indicates that the FeNi3–FeNi3N heterostructure improves the density of accessible Ni site. Furthermore, the highest TOF is achieved on FeNi3–FeNi3N, which indicates superior OER intrinsic activity of FeNi3–FeNi3N catalyst. As shown in Fig. 3c and Table S6,† at overpotential of 300 mV, the TOF of FeNi3–FeNi3N is 0.32 s−1, which exceeds that of FeNi3 (0.20 s−1) and FeNi3N (0.14 s−1). In addition, as shown in Fig. S12,† a much lower Rct on FeNi3–FeNi3N (7.0 Ω cm2) than that of FeNi3 (16.6 Ω cm2) and FeNi3N (18.8 Ω cm2) also indicates faster interfacial electron transfer kinetics between FeNi3–FeNi3N and electrolyte during oxygen evolution.
The OER durability for the prepared materials is evaluated via galvanostatic method at 10 mA cm−2. As shown in Fig. S13,† the OER catalyzed on FeNi3–FeNi3N exhibits a lowest initial potential of 260 mV. And during a 11 h test, the potential remained unchanged; this reveals a substantial durability of FeNi3–FeNi3N for OER.
As shown in Fig. S14,† our FeNi3–FeNi3N catalyst needs much lower overpotential at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 for both HER (40 mV) and OER (260 mV) in 1.0 M KOH. This is clearly desirable performance in comparison to other reported transition metal-based electrocatalysts. Considering that the FeNi3–FeNi3N has exceptional HER and OER properties, we employed FeNi3–FeNi3N modified nickel foam (NF) as the cathode and anode to fabricate a symmetric electrolyzer for overall water splitting.

Fig. 4a depicts the polarization curve of water splitting. The FeNi3–FeNi3N/NF exhibits excellent performance: only a 1.5 V cell voltage is needed to deliver a 10 mA cm−2 current density; this is much lower than most of reported values (Fig. 4b and Table S7†). The lower of cell voltage; the more efficient and less expensive would the water splitting be. For different current densities, the corresponding voltage is found to be consistent with the potential difference (ΔV) between HER and OER measured in a three-electrode system for FeNi3–FeNi3N (Fig. 4c).

(c) Cell voltage in a two-electrode configuration and the polarization curves of the voltage difference (ΔV) between HER and OER in a three-electrode system for FeNi3–FeNi3N. (d) Time-dependent current density curve for FeNi3–FeNi3N in a two-electrode configuration at a current of 10, 20, 40 mA cm−2 use smaller scale e.g. 1–2 V (e) amount of gas collected and calculated from electric quantity for FeNi3–FeNi3N during overall water splitting, and the Faraday Efficiency (FE), as calculated from hydrogen collected. 
The electrolyzer demonstrates good long-term catalytic durability, sustaining constant galvanostatic electrolysis for up to 48 h at a controllable current density (10 to 40 mA cm−2) with negligible degradation (Fig. 4d). This suggests excellent potential for practical applications. The faradaic efficiency (FE) of FeNi3–FeNi3N for the HER and OER is measured quantitatively from the total amount of charge passed through the cell during electrolysis and the total amount of evolved gas collected by water–gas displacement method.32 The amount of generated H2 and O2 matches well with the theoretically calculated amount under total charge during the electrolysis process (Fig. 4e). This suggests that the FE is close to 100% for both HER and OER, with the ratio of H2 and O2 being close to 2:1.
Conclusions
We report that FeNi3–FeNi3N heterostructure offers excellent bifunctional catalytic performance towards HER and OER. This is due to the formation of highly active Fe–Ni–Ni and Ni–Ni–Ni hollow sites for HER and a large amount of electrochemically active sites available for OER on the FeNi3–FeNi3N heterostructure. The excellent HER and OER activities makes this catalyst suitable for both electrodes, and renders it directly relevant for overall water splitting. A demonstration electrolyzer exhibits a low driving voltage of 1.50 V at the current density of 10 mA cm−2. Furthermore, the heterostructure electrocatalyst exhibits remarkable activity with a negligible decay after 48 h of operation.
