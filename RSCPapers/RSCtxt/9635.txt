    , Accepted 25th September 2015First published on 25th September 2015AbstractHollow structures with hierarchical architecture and multi-composition have attracted extensive interest because of their fascinating physicochemical properties as well as wide applications. Herein we report the designed synthesis of hierarchical nanosheet-based CoMoO4–NiMoO4 nanotubes by a hydrothermal treatment and a subsequent calcination method. The walls of the hierarchical nanotubes are composed of interconnected NiMoO4 nanosheets and CoMoO4 nanoparticles anchored on the surface of the nanosheets. The diameter of the hollow interior, the thickness of NiMoO4 nanosheets and the diameter of CoMoO4 nanoparticles are around 180 nm, less than 6 nm and 3 nm, respectively, providing the hierarchical nanotubes with a high surface area and a large pore volume. When evaluated as electrodes for pseudocapacitors, the hierarchical nanotubes with an appropriate amount of CoMoO4 show a high specific capacitance of 1079 F g−1 at a current density of 5 A g−1 and excellent stability with 98.4% capacitance retention after 1000 cycles. Furthermore, an asymmetric capacitor, consisting of active carbon and hierarchical nanosheet-based CoMoO4–NiMoO4 nanotubes as negative and positive electrodes, respectively, delivers an energy density of 33 W h kg−1 at a power density of 375 W kg−1, and 16.3 W h kg−1 even at a high power density of 6000 W kg−1. The supercapacitive properties are much higher than those of single-phase NiMoO4 nanotubes, and most of the other metal molybdates and metal oxides reported previously. Besides, the hierarchical nanotubes also exhibit much better electrocatalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction than single-phase NiMoO4 nanotubes, and most of the other metal molybdates and metal oxides. Our results demonstrate the importance of rational design of complex hollow structures with enhanced properties for a wide range of practical applications.
1 Introduction
The limited reserves of fossil fuels and the increasing environmental pollution have stimulated intense research on energy storage and conversion from alternative energy sources.1,2 Systems for electrochemical energy storage and conversion include batteries, fuel cells, electrochemical capacitors (ECs), etc.3 Compared with other storage devices, supercapacitors have several advantages such as high power density, a fast charge/discharge process, long-term stability and low maintenance cost.4 According to their charge-storage mechanisms, ECs can be classified into electrical double-layer capacitors (EDLCs) and faradaic pseudocapacitors.5–7 Faradaic pseudocapacitors have much higher power density and energy density than electrical double-layer capacitors because of their fast and reversible redox reactions (several tens of nanometers from the surface). Therefore, faradaic pseudocapacitors have attracted wide attention in recent years.8–13
Recent experimental results showed that metal oxides/hydroxides, conducting polymers and metal nitride could be used as pseudocapacitor electrode materials.14–17 Among them, metal molybdates are very promising electrode materials for high-performance ECs because of their feasible oxidation states.18–21 For example, Wan et al. synthesized NiMoO4·H2O nanoclusters, which exhibited a capacitance of 680 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1 and less than 60% of the initial capacitance could be retained after 1000 cycles.19 Liu et al. demonstrated that CoMoO4 nanorods had a high capacitance of 286 F g−1 at a current density of 5 mA cm−2.20 However, the rate capability and long-term stability of some single-phase metal molybdates are unsatisfactory.18,19,21 Recently, mixed metal molybdates exhibited enhanced rate capability compared to single-phase metal molybdates due to the synergistic effect.22–24 For instance, hierarchical MnMoO4–CoMoO4 nanowires had a capacitance of 187.1 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1, much higher than those of both single-phase MnMoO4 and CoMoO4 nanowires. Moreover, the MnMoO4–CoMoO4 nanowires exhibited a very good long-term stability.22 Liu et al. synthesized CoMoO4–NiMoO4·xH2O bundles by a chemical co-precipitation method. The mixed bundles showed a capacitance of 1039 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1 and excellent rate capability, superior to single-phase NiMoO4·xH2O.23 Besides, it is also necessary for high-performance pseudocapacitor electrode materials to have a high surface area since pseudocapacitive behavior occurs (charges stored in electrode materials) only within a few nanometres from the surface of the electrode materials. Therefore, the nanostructures with an ultrathin thickness or a high surface area for next generation high performance supercapacitors are highly desired. However, the surface areas of most of the mixed metal molybdates reported previously are relatively low, limiting their supercapacitive properties.
On the other hand, the energy density (E) of the pseudocapacitors as the next-generation energy storage devices is still unsatisfactory. The energy density can be efficiently enhanced by constructing asymmetric supercapacitors according to the following equation, E = 1/2CV2(1)where C is the specific capacitance, and V is the cell voltage.10 Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the electrochemical capacitive performance of asymmetric supercapacitors based on the designed active material.
Electrolytic water splitting holds the promise for global scale storage and conversion of renewable energy.25,26 However, electrocatalysts are usually required because of the sluggish kinetics of the OER caused by the involved multi-proton-couple electron transfer steps. Oxides of iridium and ruthenium showed high catalytic activity toward the OER, but their high cost and scarcity restricted their application on a large scale.27–29 Therefore, it is highly desirable and imperative to exploit new OER catalysts with high catalytic activity and low cost.30–34 Recently, metal molybdate nanostructures as electrocatalysts for the OER in alkaline solutions have been reported; however, the OER performance of single-phase metal molybdate nanostructures is unsatisfactory due to reasons similar to those reported when they are used as electrodes for ECs.35,36
Herein, we develop a facile strategy to fabricate hierarchical NiMoO4–CoMoO4 nanotubes (NCMNTs) consisting of ultrathin and mesoporous NiMoO4 nanosheets and CoMoO4 nanoparticles on the surface of the NiMoO4 nanosheets. The hierarchical nanotubes as pseudocapacitor electrode materials have the following advantages. (i) The surface area of the hierarchical nanotubes is greatly larger than those of mixed metal molybdates reported previously. Moreover, the thickness of the ultrathin nanosheets is less than 6 nm, which allows the active sites on the surface of the nanosheets to be exposed to the electrolyte fully. (ii) An interconnected network is formed among the nanosheets, which can enhance the stability of the structure during the charging and discharging processes. (iii) The introduction of CoMoO4 decreases the charge transfer resistance of the hierarchical nanotubes, which facilitates the enhancement of the rate capability. (iv) The special structural features of the hierarchical nanotubes including a tube-like morphology and mesopores in the nanosheets can offer more ion pathways, and thereby improve the ion transport kinetics of electrode materials. As a result, the NCMNTs as a supercapacitor electrode material exhibit excellent electrochemical properties including high specific capacitance and good rate capability. In order to improve the energy density of the hierarchical nanotubes, we also fabricated an asymmetric supercapacitor (active carbon (AC)//NCMNT), exhibiting enhanced energy density compared to those of asymmetric supercapacitors based on single counterparts and other metal oxides as positive electrodes.10,17,18,23,24 In addition, the NCMNTs can be used as electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), also exhibiting superior catalytic activity to other metal (Fe, Co, Ni) molybdates and metal oxides reported previously.32–48
2 Experimental section
2.1 Synthesis of hierarchical NCMNTs
The hierarchical NCMNTs were synthesized through the following two steps. 75 mg of MoO3 nanorods, 620 mg of nickel acetate, and cobalt chloride with a different weight were dispersed in 35 mL water–ethanol (volume ratio = 1:1) solvent under sonication for 20 min. The mixture was poured into a 40 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave for thermal treatment at 90 °C for 5 h. As the autoclave was cooled to room temperature, the precipitates were washed with distilled water and absolute ethanol seven times, and dried in air at 60 °C. The precursors were annealed in an air atmosphere at 500 °C for 2 h, and then the hierarchical NCMNTs were synthesized successfully. The samples obtained with added weights of cobalt chloride of 85 mg, 75 mg and 65 mg were named as NCMNT-1, NCMNT-2 and NCMNT-3, respectively. For comparison, the pure hierarchical NiMoO4 nanosheet-based nanotubes (NMNTs) were also prepared through our previous method with simple modification.21
2.2 Structural characterization
The samples were characterized by using a scanning electron microscope (SEM; HITACHI SU8000) and a transmission electron microscope (TEM; FEI Tecnai-F20) equipped with a Gatan Imaging Filter (GIF). The crystal structure of the sample was determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) [D/max 2550 V, Cu Kα radiation]. The pore diameter distribution and surface area were tested by nitrogen adsorption/desorption analysis (TRISTAR II3020). ICP mass spectrometry was carried out by using a Thermo iCAP 6000 ICP-MS.
2.3 Electrochemical measurements
Electrochemical supercapacitor measurements were performed in a three-electrode electrochemical cell containing 2 M KOH aqueous solution as the electrolyte. Cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge–discharge were carried out using a CHI660D electrochemical workstation. A platinum foil and a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) were used as counter and reference electrodes, respectively. The working electrode was prepared as follows: 75 wt% of the active material, 15 wt% of acetylene black, and 10 wt% of polytetrafluoroethylene were mixed under sonication until a homogeneous black slurry was obtained. The slurry was pressed into a nickel foam, and then dried at 60 °C for 12 h. The working electrode with a geometric surface area of 1 cm2 contained 2.6 mg of NCMNTs.
The asymmetric supercapacitor with NCMNTs-3 as a positive electrode and AC as a negative electrode was assembled with a porous polymer membrane separator. The negative electrode was prepared as follows: AC (80 wt%), MWNTs (10 wt%) and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) (10 wt%) were mixed under sonication until a homogeneous black slurry was obtained. The slurry was pressed into nickel foam, and then dried at 90 °C for 12 h. The negative electrode with a geometric surface area of 1 cm2 contained 8.7 mg of AC. A 2 M KOH solution was employed as the electrolyte for the two-electrode measurements.
The specific capacitance values of the electrode were calculated from galvanostatic charge–discharge curves according to eqn (2), Cs = iΔt/mΔV(2)where Cs (F g−1) is the specific capacitance, i (A) is the discharge current, Δt (s) is the discharge time, m (g) is the weight of the active materials, and ΔV is the voltage interval of the discharge. The power density of the asymmetric supercapacitor was calculated by eqn (3), P = E/Δt(3)
The OER activities of NMNTs and NCMNTs were carried out using a CHI660D electrochemical workstation with a standard three-electrode cell in 1 M KOH aqueous solution. The working electrode is prepared through the same method as that used for the preparation of the supercapacitor electrode, but the loading weight is around 7 mg. A platinum foil and a Ag/AgCl electrode were used as counter and reference electrodes, respectively. The polarization curves were recorded by linear sweep of potential at a scan rate of 1 mV s−1. All data have been corrected with iR compensation based on impedance spectroscopy. The measured potentials were also referenced to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) with the following equation: ERHE = EAg/AgCl + 0.059 × pH + 0.21.
3 Results and discussion
3.1 Structural characterization
The MoO3 nanorods used in this work have a diameter and a length of around 170 nm and several micrometers, respectively.49–51 The information about the crystal phase and structure of the NCMNTs was obtained by XRD measurements. Fig. 1 shows a typical XRD pattern of NCMNT-3. By comparison of the measured result with the data from the joint committee on powder diffraction standards (JCPDS), we find that the diffraction peaks come from monoclinic NiMoO4 (JCPDS, card no. 45-0142, cell parameters: a = 1.0184 nm, b = 0.8734 nm, c = 0.7649 nm, β = 107.095°) and monoclinic CoMoO4 (JCPDS, card no. 25-1434, cell parameters: a = 0.967 nm, b = 0.885 nm, c = 0. 776 nm, β = 113.082°). The weak intensities of the diffraction peaks indicate poor crystallizations of both NiMoO4 and CoMoO4 in NCMNT-3. The poor crystallization of the NCMNTs may be favorable for the increment in their electrochemical performance because of more defects present in the active materials with a weak crystallinity.17
 Fig. 1  XRD pattern of the hierarchical nanosheet-based NCMNT-3 nanotubes. 
The morphology and the microstructure of NCMNT-3 were characterized by SEM and TEM measurements. Fig. 2(a) shows the SEM image of NCMNT-3. It can be found that many nanosheets branch out from the surface of NCMNT-3, forming an interesting three-dimensional (3D) hierarchical architecture. The nanosheets connect to each other and form a network-like structure, leading to the formation of void space among the nanosheets. On one hand, the network-like structure is favorable for the structural stability of NCMNTs during long-term electrochemical measurements. On the other hand, abundant void space among the interconnected nanosheets can make NCMNT-3 fully accessible to the electrolyte. Compared to the initial MoO3 nanorods, the diameter of the 3D hierarchical architecture is increased to 400–600 nm, but its length is decreased to around 3.5 μm, as shown in Fig. 2(a). The increase in diameter is due to foreign materials grown along the radial direction, and the shortened length is due to the alkali etching effect.21 The inset in Fig. 2(a) shows that the central parts of NCMNT-3 exhibits a hollow character, suggesting that NCMNT-3 has a tube-like morphology. This can be further confirmed by TEM observation, as shown in Fig. 2(b). From the TEM image, the diameter of the hollow interior of NCMNT-3 is around 180 nm, and the height of the interconnected nanosheets is about 120 nm. The high-magnification TEM image (Fig. 2(c)) shows that the average thickness of the nanosheets is less than 6 nm. Interestingly, not only diffraction rings but also diffraction dots can be observed clearly in the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern, as shown in the inset of Fig. 2(c) and S1.† By careful measurements, the labeled diffraction rings can be indexed to the (22−2), (222), (060), and (622) planes of the monoclinic NiMoO4 phase, whereas the labeled diffraction dots are indexed to the (111), (−335) and (−424) planes of the monoclinic CoMoO4 phase, which is consistent with the XRD analysis. The atomic ratio of Ni to Co was determined by ICP-MS measurements to be about 9.5:1. The total molar quantities of Ni and Co are larger than that of Mo, indicating that residue MoO3 is not left in NCMNT-3. Fig. 2(d) displays a high-magnification TEM image taken from a basal plane of the nanosheets. It can be found that there are small particles with a size of around 5 nm anchored on the surface of the basal plane. The upper inset of Fig. 2(d) shows a high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image taken from small particles. The labeled lattice distance is 0.21 nm, corresponding to the (222) plane of the monoclinic CoMoO4 phase. The marked lattice distance of the smooth surface of the nanosheets without small particles is 0.26 nm, corresponding to the (22−2) plane of the monoclinic NiMoO4 phase. Thus, the hierarchical NCMNTs are composed of ultrathin NiMoO4 nanosheets and CoMoO4 nanoparticles anchored on the surface of the nanosheets. Besides CoMoO4 nanoparticles, there are small pores in the surface of NiMoO4 nanosheets, as shown in Fig. S2.† In order to further determine the elemental distribution in NCMNTs, annular dark-field (ADF) scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM, Fig. 2(e)) and the corresponding linear scanning energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDX) (Fig. 2(f)) were carried out. As shown in Fig. 2(f), Mo, Ni, Co and O elements are distributed in the whole region of the NCMNTs, however, their quantities are much higher in the external region than in the inner one. This not only further confirms the elemental composition, but also the tubular character of NCMNTs. The STEM image and the corresponding EDX elemental mappings show that NiMoO4 and CoMoO4 are mainly distributed on the nanosheets (Fig. S3†), but the amount of CoMoO4 is less than that of NiMoO4.

The SEM and TEM observations show that NCMNT-3 with a tubular character consists of the interconnected NiMoO4 nanosheets with small CoMoO4 nanoparticles anchored on the nanosheets, suggesting that it has a large surface area. In terms of its nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms, the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area of NCMNT-3 was calculated to be 186.7 m2 g−1 (Fig. S4(a)†), which is much higher than those of CoMoO4–NiMoO4 composites reported previously.23,24 In addition, the hierarchical nanotubes exhibited a type IV hysteresis, indicating the presence of a mesoporous structure. The average pore diameter and cumulative volume of pores calculated from the adsorption branch of the nitrogen isotherm using the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method are about 17.4 nm and 0.97 cm3 g−1, respectively, as shown in Fig. S4(b).† Moreover, the pore size distribution of NCMNT-3 exhibits a bimodal distribution with a narrow distribution centered at 10 nm and a broadened distribution centred at 120 nm. The small pore may be associated with pores in NiMoO4 nanosheets and the larger pore originates from the hollow interior of NCMNT-3. The porous and hollow character of NCMNTs with a large surface area and large pore volume is favoured in supercapacitor applications since it provides not only larger contact area between the electrode and electrolyte for shortening the charge diffusion pathway, but also more active sites for taking part in redox reactions.
In order to investigate the effect of the added weight of cobalt chloride on the structure and morphology of the products, a series of compared experiments were carried out. We noted that NCMNTs could successfully be fabricated as the added weight of cobalt chloride ranges from 65 to 85 mg. As mentioned above, the obtained samples, as the added weights of cobalt chloride changed to 85 and 75 mg, are named as NCMNT-1 and NCMNT-2, respectively. XRD (Fig. S5†) and SEM (Fig. S6†) analyses show that they have similar phase compositions and morphologies to NCMNT-3. ICP-MS measurements display that the atomic ratio of Ni and Co for NCMNT-1 was about 7.5:1 and about 8.4:1 for NCMNT-2. The nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms (Fig. S7 and S8†) show that the BET surface areas of NCMNT-1 and NCMNT-2 are 112.7 and 131.1 m2 g−1, respectively. The average pore diameter and cumulative volume of pores are about 15.5 nm and 0.43 cm3 g−1 for NCMNT-1, and about 17.3 nm and 0.68 cm3 g−1 for NCMNT-2, respectively. However, when the added weight of cobalt chloride exceeded 95 mg, two kinds of precipitates with different colors would be formed in the precursors. The SEM image (Fig. S9(a)†) shows that besides the hierarchical nanotubes, 2D nanosheets are also formed in the precursors. Moreover, the amount of 2D nanosheets increased with the further increase of the weight of cobalt chloride (i.e. 590 mg), as shown in Fig. S9(b).† This suggests that uniform NCMNTs could not be formed if the added weight of cobalt chloride exceeded 95 mg. On the other hand, any material could not be grown on the surface of MoO3 nanorods without nickel acetate in the reaction system, as shown in Fig. S10.† As discussed in our previous report,21 it is associated with the formation mechanism of the hierarchical nanosheet-based nanotubes. Such hierarchical nanotubes were only produced in a weak alkaline solution. However, the water–ethanol solvent only containing cobalt chloride cannot provide a weak alkaline condition. Thus under the condition, the hierarchical nanotubes could not be obtained. If cobalt chloride was replaced with cobalt acetate, the hierarchical CoMoO4–NiMoO4 nanotubes would be obtained, as shown in Fig. S11(a) and (b).† However, the length of the nanotubes decreased significantly due to the enhanced alkalinity of the solution (Fig. S11(b)†). In addition, we tried to synthesize the hierarchical CoMoO4 nanotubes using MoO3 nanorods and cobalt acetate as precursors in the water–ethanol (volume ratio = 1:1) system, however, the experimental results showed that the hierarchical CoMoO4 nanotubes could not be fabricated successfully, as shown in Fig. S12.†
3.2 Electrochemical supercapacitive performance
The electrochemical performance of the hierarchical NCMNTs as supercapacitor electrodes was evaluated using a three-electrode configuration in 2 M KOH solution as the electrolyte. Fig. 3 shows the cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves of the NMNTs and NCMNTs at various scan rates in the potential range of 0–0.5 V vs. the SCE. Significant redox peaks can be observed in each curve, suggesting that the measured capacitances of all the hierarchical nanotubes are mainly based on the pseudocapacitive mechanism. The intensities of the redox current peaks increase with an increase of the scan rate, suggesting a surface-controlled electrochemical process, i.e., the kinetics of the interface faradic redox reactions. With increasing scan rate, the oxidation peak shifts towards a more positive potential and the reduction peak shifts towards a more negative potential. This is attributed to an increase of the internal diffusion resistance within the active material with an increase in scan rate.15,16 Even at a high scan rate (50 mV s−1), the redox peaks are still evident, suggesting that the NCMNTs as the electrodes for ECs are stable and have good rate capability.

Fig. 4 shows the galvanostatic charge–discharge curves of the NMNTs and NCMNTs at various current densities at room temperature. The specific capacitances were calculated from the discharge curves according to eqn (2), and the calculated values are shown in Fig. 5(a) and Table S1.† As shown in Fig. 5 and Table S1,† NCMNT-2 and NCMNT-3 show comparable electrochemical supercapacitive performance, and their specific capacitances are 1307 and 1424 F g−1 at 1 A g−1, respectively, greatly larger than that of NMNTs (887 F g−1). Although the capacitance of NCMNT-1 (865 F g−1) at 1 A g−1 is slightly smaller than that of NMNTs, all of the NCMNTs exhibit better rate capabilities than NMNTs. When the current density was increased from 1 to 20 A g−1, nearly 58.1, 67.2 and 74.2% of the initial capacitance value of NCMNT-3, NCMNT-2 and NCMNT-1 still remained; however, only 14.6% of the initial capacitance value of NMNTs remained. Thus, it can be concluded that CoMoO4 with an appropriate amount in NCMNTs not only can improve the capacitance value, but also significantly enhance the rate capability of NCMNTs. Furthermore, with an increase of the amount of CoMoO4, the capacitance of NCMNTs decreased, but the rate capability improved, which is consistent with the previous results reported by Liu et al.23 Thus, NCMNT-3 shows superior electrochemical properties, including higher specific capacitance and better rate capability, to NMNTs. Importantly, compared to other metal molybdates and metal oxides, NCMNT-3 also exhibited excellent electrochemical performance, as shown in Table S1.†15–24 The enhanced supercapacitive performance of NCMNTs is due to the following points. (i) It is attributed to the synergistic effect between NiMoO4 and CoMoO4 active materials since both NiMoO4 and CoMoO4 contribute to the total capacitances.23,24 (ii) The surface areas of NCMNTs are larger than those of NMNTs, other metal molybdates and metal oxides,17,21–24 allowing NCMNTs to provide more active sites for the redox reactions. (iii) The introduction of CoMoO4 in the NCMNTs can increase the conductivity of electrodes, which favors in the enhancement of the rate capability. This is evidenced by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Fig. 5(b) shows the Nyquist plots of NCMNTs and NMNTs. Each plot shows a semicircle in a high-frequency region and a straight line in the low-frequency region, suggesting light electrochemical polarization and good capacitive properties. As fitted from the experimental data by a model (the inset in Fig. 5(b)), the charge-transfer resistances can be obtained. The fitted results show that the NCMNT-3 electrode has smaller charge-transfer resistance (1.035 Ω) than those of NMNT (1.544 Ω), NCMNT-1 (1.299 Ω) and NCMNT-2 (1.14 Ω) electrodes. In addition, NCMNTs have more vertical straight lines than those of NMNTs, indicating that NCMNTs have lower diffusive resistances to the electrolyte and faster ion transport speed than NMNTs.

The cycling stabilities of NCMNTs and NMNTs were evaluated using a long-term galvanostatic charge–discharge process (Fig. 6). The capacitances of NCMNTs and NMNTs increased from the first cycle to the 55th cycle, which may be associated with the activation of the active materials. After around 1000 cycles the capacitances of NCMNTs stabilized, and capacitance retentions of 111%, 109% and 98.4% were achieved for NCMNT-1, NCMNT-2 and NCMNT-3 at a current density of 5 A g−1; however, capacitance retention of NMNTs (the initial capacitance of 603 F g−1) is only 74.6%. This implies that the NCMNTs exhibit better electrochemical stability than NMNTs.

Due to the better overall electrochemical supercapacitive performance of NCMNT-3, we used it as the positive electrode to assemble an asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) with the AC as the negative electrode. Fig. 7(a) shows the CV curves of the AC and NCMNT-3 at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1, which indicate that the stable voltage for the AC is between −1.0 and 0 V with a EDLC behavior, and between 0 and 0.5 V for the NCMNT-3 with a pseudocapacitive behavior. Therefore, the operating cell voltage can be greatly enhanced when they are assembled into the ASC. A series of CV curves with different voltage windows at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 were measured to estimate the operating potential of the ASC cell. As shown in Fig. 7(b), the potential window for the ASC may be extended to 1.8 V. However, the galvanostatic charge–discharge curves at 5 mA under a potential exceeding 1.6 V in 2 M KOH solution demonstrate distinct asymmetry between charge and discharge curves (Fig. S13†). Thus, we determine the potential window for the ASC to be 1.5 V. Fig. 7(c) shows the CV curves of the ASC at different scan rates under a potential of 1.5 V. It can be found that both pseudocapacitive and EDLC types of capacitance contribute to the total capacitance of the ASC cell. The current density increased with the scan rates, and the oxidation peak shifted to a more positive potential, similar to the phenomena observed in the three-electrode configuration. Even at a high scan rate of 50 mV s−1, the redox peaks are still evident, suggesting good rate capability of the assembled ASC cell. In order to further understand the rate capability, galvanostatic charge–discharge curves at different current densities under 1.5 V in 2 M KOH solution were also obtained (Fig. 7(d)). The specific capacitance calculated based on the total mass of the electrodes can reach 105 F g−1 at a current density of 5 mA cm−2 (0.5 A g−1), and it still retains 52 F g−1 at a high current density of 87 mA cm−2 (8 A g−1), further confirming the good rate capability of the ASC cell. The energy density and power density of the full cell, calculated according to eqn (1) and (3), respectively, are plotted in a Ragone plot in Fig. 7(e). The asymmetric capacitor delivers an energy density of 33 W h kg−1 at a power density of 375 W kg−1, and 16.3 W h kg−1 even at a high power density of 6000 W kg−1. These values are much higher than those of most of the reported ASC cells based on other metal molybdates and metal oxides, and are summarized in Table S2.†10,17,18,22–24 Furthermore, the ASC cell exhibited good long-term cycling performance, as shown in Fig. 7(f). After 1000 cycles, the capacitance retention is up to 91.8% of the initial value. The results above demonstrate that our hybrid supercapacitor is very promising for practical application as a high power energy device.

3.3 Electrocatalytic OER performance
NCMNTs with a high surface area and a large pore volume may exhibit good OER performance because the OER generally occurs through a surface-controlled electrochemical process, similarly to the pseudocapacitive mechanism. Fig. 8(a) shows the polarization curves of NMNTs and NCMNTs at a slow scan rate of 1 mV s−1. The potential required to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm−2 corresponds to 10% efficient solar water-splitting devices, and thus it is a critical factor of merit for OER catalysts. It can be found that NCMNT-3 with a higher surface area exhibits a small potential of 1.530 V, greatly lower than NCMNT-1 (1.570 V), NCMNT-2 (1.557 V) and NMNTs (1.589 V). Notably, NCMNT-3 shows the smallest potential value required to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm−2 compared to other electrocatalysts based on other metal molybdate and metal oxide nanostructures reported previously (Table S3†).32,33,37–48 After the potentials, the current densities increased sharply with the increase of the potentials, indicating good OER catalytic activities of our catalysts. For example, to deliver a current density of 100 and 300 mA cm−2 NCMNT-3 requires a potential of 1.585 and 1.617 V, respectively. The OER catalytic activities of NCMNT-3 outperform many other reported metal molybdate and metal oxide nanostructures (Table S3†).35,41,45,48 Both high current and low potential indicate that NCMNT-3 can be used as a high-performance OER catalyst.
 Fig. 8  (a) Polarization curves of NMNTs and NCMNTs, (b) Tafel slopes of NMNTs and NCMNTs, (c) the Nyquist plots of NMNTs and NCMNT-3 at 1.596 V vs. the RHE and (d) polarization curves of NCMNT-3 before and after 1000 CV. 
Tafel plots are applied to evaluate the efficiency of the catalytic reaction obtained from the polarization curves by the Tafel equation η = blog(j/j0), where η is the overpotential, b is the Tafel slope, j is the current density, and j0 is the exchange current density. As shown in Fig. 8(b) the NCMNT-3 exhibits a Tafel slope of 68 mV per decade, much smaller than those of NCMNT-1 (98 mV per decade), NCMNT-2 (94 mV per decade) and NMNTs (126 mV per decade). This suggests a fast OER kinetics of NCMNT-3, evidenced by bubbles which were clearly observed on the anode surface after the potential of 1.490 V.
To further prove the OER efficiency of NMNTs and NCMNT-3, EIS was conducted to study the electrode kinetics under OER conditions. The Nyquist plots (Fig. 8(c)) show that the charge-transfer resistance of NCMNT-3 (0.44 Ω) is smaller than that of NMNTs (1.38 Ω). Besides, the catalytic activity, stability is another crucial factor for OER application. The stabilities of NCMNT-3 were assessed by repeated potential cycling for 1000 cycles, as shown in Fig. 8(d). Only a slight decay of the activity (<9%) was observed as shown by the polarization curves after the long-term test, implying a good stability of NCMNT-3 toward the OER.
4 Conclusions
In summary, a novel strategy, involving a hydrothermal treatment and a subsequent calcination method, has been developed to synthesize hierarchical nanosheet-based CoMoO4–NiMoO4 nanotubes with high surface area. When used as the electrodes for pseudocapacitors and electrocatalysts for the OER, the hierarchical nanotubes with an appropriate amount of CoMoO4 exhibit much better electrochemical properties than single-phase NiMoO4 nanotubes, and most of the other metal molybdates and metal oxides reported previously. Thus, rational design of hollow structures with hierarchical architecture and multi-composition can enhance their physicochemical properties and extend their practical application fields efficiently.
