Different chelation around the boron center (O,O-, N,C-, N,O-, and N,N-) has been explored to tune the electronic and photophysical properties of tetra-coordinated boron compounds. A number of fascinating molecules with interesting properties such as aggregation induced emission, mechanochromism and tunable emission by changing the solvent polarity were realised.

Introduction
Organic emissive molecules or fluorophores have drawn increasing attention owing to their applications in organic light-emitting devices (OLED), nonlinear optics, organic field effect transistors (OFETs), biomolecular probes, organic solid-state lasers (OSLs), fluorescent sensors, etc.1–5 The introduction of a heteroatom such as B, Al, Si, P, Sn etc.6–9 into the backbone of the fluorophores has proven to be a powerful approach to tune the electronic properties of organic emissive materials. Boron-based fluorophores are broadly divided into two groups, namely, (a) tri-coordinated boron compounds and (b) tetra-coordinated boron compounds.
Normally, tri-coordinated boron compounds are Lewis acidic due to the presence of an empty pz-orbital. The presence of the empty p-orbital on the boron center makes these compounds excellent π-acceptors, which can provide significant delocalisation when conjugated with organic π-systems. Owing to the vacant coordination site on the boron center, these compounds are prone to attack by Lewis bases like water, which leads to bond cleavage or the formation of four coordinate boron species. The stabilisation of tri-coordinated boron complexes has been made possible by the use of sterically crowded aromatic groups such as mesityl, fluoro mesityl, and triisopropyl phenyl or by using π-donor substituents like alkoxy groups. The tri-coordinated boron compounds thus obtained showed potential applications in OLEDs, OFETs, as sensors and as fluorescent indicators in bio imaging.10–15
In general, the tetra-coordinated boron compounds are more stable compared to tri-coordinated boron compounds. Consequently, much effort has been devoted to the molecular design of tetra-coordinated boron compounds which have been widely used in optoelectronics including photoresponsive materials, OLEDs, OFETs, sensory and biological imaging materials.16–22 In tetra-coordinated boron compounds, the coordinative saturation of the boron centre confers increased chemical stability and rigidity, often accompanied by a significantly higher fluorescence quantum yield. In most of the tetra-coordinated boron compounds, the chelate ligand is more often monoanionic in nature to produce charge neutral boron complexes. The vital role of the Lewis acidic boron atom is to stabilize the anionic chelate ligand by forming covalent bonds with the chelate and dissipating the negative charge on the ligand. As a consequence of chelation to boron, the π-conjugation of the chelate is reinforced. The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of tetra-coordinated boron compounds is generally localized on the π-conjugated chelating ligand while the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) is localized either at the chelating ligand or the R (aryl, alkyl, or halo) group depending on the nature of the latter. The π–π* electronic transitions of the ligand or charge transfer transition from the R group to the ligand are usually responsible for the luminescence properties of this class of compounds. Hence, variations on the chelating ligand or R group of the molecule would influence the HOMO–LUMO levels and thereby the colour of emission. The luminescent tetra-coordinated boron compounds can be broadly classified into four different types based on the chelated donor atoms, namely, (a) O,O-chelate boron compounds, (b) N,C-chelate boron compounds, (c) N,O-chelate boron compounds, and (d) N,N-chelate boron compounds. This perspective highlights the recent advances in the field of tetra-coordinated boron based fluorophores and their potential use in a range of applications.
O,O-chelate B–O coordinated boron compounds
Among the tetra-coordinated boron based fluorophores, O,O-chelated compounds especially boron-β-diketonate compounds (1) are studied to a greater extent (Fig. 1). Boron-β-diketonate compounds exhibit good stability and accessibility to a wide range of substitutions. The luminescence properties have been tuned by varying the R-groups at the 1 and 3 positions using different aromatic substituents. Purely aliphatic substitution at both 1 and 3-positions does not show any luminescence properties. Another interesting aspect of the boron-β-diketonate system is that they show good quantum yields with a large Stokes shift unlike the boron-dipyrromethene (BODIPY) system.

In the past few decades, efforts have been made to synthesize boron based β-diketonate derivatives with excellent photophysical properties and to use them as non-linear optical materials, fluorescent molecular rotors, lasers, semiconductors, emitters, photosensitizers, and oxygen sensors.20 Owing to these exciting properties, in recent years, efforts were continued to synthesize new boron based β-diketonate derivatives. The synthesis of cyclic amine substituted boron-β-diketonates was reported by Fraser and co-workers who studied their stimuli responsive luminescence properties and the effect of the amine ring size (Fig. 1, 2, 3). Boron-β-diketonates showed interesting properties such as aggregation induced emission (AIE), mechanochromic luminescence (ML), solvatochromism, and viscochromism.23,24 Recently, boron-coordinated β-diketonates having a triphenylamine moiety (4) that exhibits different fluorescent colour in the amorphous and crystalline states were reported. The red emission of the amorphous state and orange emission of the crystalline state were able to be reversibly switched by grinding and fuming processes. The thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) of this compound was tuned by changing the aggregation state.25 Yang and co-workers synthesized carbazole substituted boron-β-diketonates (5–8) and explored their two photon excited fluorescence in the solution state. Additionally, they studied their emission behaviour by grinding, heating and by exposing them to solvent vapour, and found that these materials exhibit mechanochromism.26 The carbazole substituted boron-β-diketonate (8) was used to explore the crystallization process of organic micro crystalline materials. The emission properties of amorphous molecular aggregates in aqueous dispersion and nanorods formed by adding the surfactant were used as a fingerprint for the crystallization process.27 Moreover, compound 8 (Fig. 1) was explored for its optical waveguide ability with low optical loss.28
Recently, Zhang and co-workers29 reported heavy atom free boron-β-diketonates (Fig. 2) that exhibit triplet quantum yield by using oxygen-bridged electron donating moieties (9). These molecules showed triplet quantum yield through a combination of intersystem crossing and transition angular momentum. A series of boron β-diketonates (10–12) with alkoxy and alkyl substituents on the phenyl ring attached at the 1 or 3-positions were synthesized and utilized as thermometers by using their emission. By changing the temperature, the fluorescence changed from green to orange which was utilized to detect the temperature.30,31

As oxygen is essential in life, its detection is very important. Fraser and co-workers synthesized meta-alkoxy substituted boron-β-diketonates. It was proposed that intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) from the oxygen of the meta-alkoxy group to the halide and boron in the excited state is involved in the process. A comparison of oxygen calibration using meta-alkoxy vs. para-alkoxy substituted boron-β-diketonates reveals stronger phosphorescence and better oxygen-sensing in the former (13).32 The effect of heteroaryl groups such as thiophene and furan by replacing one of the aryl group was also studied by Fraser's group (Fig. 2). The optical properties of boron-β-diketonates with mixed heteroaryl and methoxy-aryl substituted compounds reveal neither mechano- nor thermal-responsive behaviour. However, dodecyloxy-substituted dyes showed thermal (furan) and mechanochromic (thiophene) responses (14).33
Boron-β-diketonates with different aryl groups on one side and methoxy-aromatic groups on the other side were synthesized by Fraser and co-workers. Polylactide blends of these compounds (15–19) and methoxy-substituted-boron-benzoylacetonates (not shown) showed phosphorescence and are also able to sense oxygen.34,35 Tuning of the fluorescence/phosphorescence ratio and room temperature phosphorescence lifetime by introducing Br on naphthyl, phenyl or both was used to test the heavy atom placement effects (20).36
β-Diketonates with the tetraphenylene unit in general showed interesting aggregation induced emission, in some instances mechanochromism was also observed as a common phenomenon.37–42 A tetraphenylene-phenyl-boron-β-diketonate (21) with four emission colours such as green, yellow, orange and red in four polymorphs is presented (Fig. 3). Furthermore, this compound also showed reversible changes of luminescence to external stimuli such as heating, grinding, fuming and pressure.41 The replacement of phenyl with pyrene in compound 21, resulted in a compound (22) with high torsional molecular conformation. Compound 21 also exhibits reversible mechanochromic behaviour with the emission colour changing between yellow and orange-red upon grinding and fuming.39 The mechanochromic behaviour of a series of aryl groups with carbonyl substituted-boron-β-diketonates was studied (23–25). Combined experimental and theoretical studies reveal the presence of a varying number of straps in the amorphous and crystalline states which are responsible for the mechanochromic behaviour.43,44

The nature of the R-group on the chelating boron (26, 27) plays a crucial role in the observed photophysical and mechanofluorochromic properties (Fig. 3). The difluoroboron-complex showed mechanofluorochromic responses whereas diphenyl-boron complexes did not show any change in fluorescence upon grinding.45 Boron-β-diketonates were also investigated as emitters in organic light emitting devices. Sasabe and co-workers studied the OLED properties of a boron-β-diketonate (28) along with a carbazole derivative which showed an external quantum efficiency (ηext) of 10%.46 A nopinone-based-boron-β-diketonate was synthesized and studied for its AIE and electroluminescence properties. The device studied using 29 (R = OCH3) showed a luminous efficacy of 7.09 lm W−1.47
Dithienylethene containing boron-β-diketonates were synthesized and studied for their multiresponsive character including photoresponse under photoexcitation by different groups.48–53 Compound 30 was utilized by Yam's group and compound 31 was studied by the Li group (Fig. 4).48,49 One side chloro and the other side boron-β-diketonate substituted dithienylethiene (32) was synthesized and utilized as a blue/red light-triggered optical switch.54 Glyoxal-derived Ugi adducts and [2.2] paracyclophane-based β-diketonates were used as a starting material for the synthesis of boron-β-diketonates 33 and 34, respectively (Fig. 4). The former showed very interesting AIE properties55 and the later showed solvatochromism.56 As liquid crystals are a subject of considerable interest, Lai and co-workers synthesized bis-(boron difluoride) compounds with a skeleton of 35 starting from substituted tetraketonates. The phase transitions and mesomorphic properties of the compounds were studied in detail. Compound 34 (n = 8, 10, 12) showed enantiotropic columnar mesophases.57

Curcuminoid derivatives of curcumin contain a central β-diketonate unit. Due to the extended π-conjugation, the boron-derivatives of curcuminoids exhibit strong absorption and emission in the visible region and NIR region depending on the substitution.58,59 The effect of aryl groups in these boron-β-diketonates of curcuminoids (36) was studied by Canard and co-workers (Fig. 5).60 The Hudson and Guo groups exploited the curcuminoid strategy to prepare near-infrared emissive molecules. The Guo group made a Glu-DFB-biotin fluorescent probe 37 which can differentiate hepatic cancer cells from normal cells whereas the Hudson group made polymers of boron-curcuminoids (38) for immune fluorescence labelling of SK-BR3 human breast-cancer cells.61,62 Curcuminoid derivatives of boron-β-diketonate with triphenyl amine group 39 (R = H, Cl, Ph) (Fig. 5) at the end were synthesized and used in solution processed bulk-heterojunction organic solar cells which showed a power conversion efficiency up to 4.14%.63 Curcuminoid derivatives of boron-β-diketonates were also utilized for sensing volatile acid and amine vapors.64 Near-infrared (NIR) emissive materials have gained attention owing to their potential applications in optoelectronics. Adachi and co-workers took advantage of the curcumin framework to make curcuminoid derivatives of boron-β-diketonate with NIR emissive materials. Compound 39 (R = –COOC2H5) with triphenylamine substitution exhibited near-infrared TADF. Organic light emitting diodes constructed using this material showed an external quantum efficiency of nearly 10%, which suggests that TADF technology is suitable for high-performance NIR OLEDs.65 The dimeric curcuminoid derivative 4066 showed remarkable NIR TADF emission, and an OLED external quantum efficiency of 5.1%. Moreover, doped thin films of 40 displayed amplified spontaneous emission above 800 nm with a threshold as low as 7.5 μJ cm−2. Compound 4167 exhibited a high PL quantum yield at >700 nm and amplified spontaneous emission. The thiophene rings present in the system increase the acceptor–donor interactions and thus help in narrowing of the HOMO–LUMO energy gap which helps in achieving the properties mentioned above.68 Rochford and co-workers69,70 synthesized a series of curcuminoid derivatives of D–A–D type BF2 compounds with the π-extended aryl group and electron donating amino groups and studied their photophysical and photoacoustic properties.

N,C-chelate B–N coordinated boron compounds
Although, the chemistry of B–N coordinated N,C-chelated boron compounds was pioneered by Dewar and co-workers,71 it has gained momentum since the exemplary work reported by Yamaguchi and co-workers.72 Readers interested to know more about the history of the electrophilic C–H borylation reaction are requested to go through the recent review written by Ingelson and co-workers.73
The boryl-substituted thienylthiazole dimers 42–44 (Fig. 6) reported by Yamaguchi and co-workers72 form a π-conjugated planar array via B–N coordination and are also proven to be prospective electron-transporting materials. In 2016, Dou and co-workers75 utilized the B–N coordinated thenylthiazole framework to make all polymer based solar cells in combination with isoindigo and dithenyldiketopyrrolopyrrole units (45 and 46). The constructed all-polymer solar-cell device showed a power conversion efficiency of more than 5.0%. Prior to this work, Dou et al.74 explored the effect of the B–N unit which is isoelectronic with the C–C unit (47 and 48). The replacement of C–C by B–N helped to decrease the energy levels of both HOMO and LUMO levels and also transforms the resulting polymer into an electron acceptor. Polymer solar cells developed using B–N coordinated materials showed better power conversion efficiency over C–C based materials.76 Wang and co-workers synthesized a series of N,C-chelated B–N coordinated compounds (49–52). Many of these molecules showed photoisomerization. The photochromic behavior was monitored using emission as well as other methods. The polymeric effect and effect of inner transition metals were also studied (Fig. 7).77–85 Li and co-workers further explored the photoisomerization reaction using theoretical studies.86,87

In 2019, the Wang group88 reported the synthesis of five pairs of regioisomers (53–57) based on the indolizino[3,4,5-ab]isoindole backbone as shown in Fig. 8. The regioisomers exhibit different photophysical properties, and the major isomer showed a smaller optical energy gap than its minor isomer which has an internal B–N bond. The ‘a’ isomers have weaker B–N bond strength than ‘b’ isomers. Variable temperature emission experiments reveal that the regioisomer with the internal B–N bond showed temperature dependent structural dynamics which was supported by TD-DFT calculations. They further showed that the temperature dependent emission of these regioisomers was fully reversible which opens a new class of B–N coordinated compounds as temperature probes. Fluoride titration experiments showed that isomers ‘a’ require a smaller amount of tetrabutylammonium fluoride (TABF) over isomers ‘b’ to reach the saturation point. With the help of VT-1H, 11B-NMR and TBAF titration experiments they proved that the Lewis acidity of N-heterocyclic units and the inductive effect of dichotomic units in isomers ‘a’ and ‘b’ are responsible for B–N bond strengths. Taking advantage of the B–N coordination, Wang and co-workers also designed stimuli responsive (heat and mechanical pressure) B/N Lewis pairs.89 The same group also90 synthesized and characterized Pt(II) complexes that contain dithienylethene (DTE) and B(ppy)Mes2 as photochromic units (58–60). UV/Vis and NMR experiments showed that only DTE units of all the complexes undergo reversible photoisomerization under UV light irradiation. Prolonged irradiation leads to the rearrangement of ring closed isomers rather than the isomerization of boryl units. Although B(ppy)Mes2 units do not undergo isomerization, they enhance the quantum efficiency of DTE units through the antennae effect. DFT calculations proved that the photoisomerization reaction proceeds through the triplet pathway by an efficient energy transfer process. Wu and co-workers91 prepared Ir-based complexes having a 2-phenylpyridine type tetra-coordinated organoboron motif for OLED application. The Ir-fused boron compounds showed a high photoluminescence quantum yield ranging from 60 to 100% and excellent device fabrication character with a maximum external quantum efficiency of 26%.

The Jäkle group reported various B–N coordinated ladder type boranes (61, 62) as shown in Fig. 9. They further utilized the same motif to make homo and co-polymers (63, 64). The polymers exhibited high solution state quantum yields up to 78%.92,93 In 2019, the Jäkle group94 reported pyrene based N–C chelate boron compounds (65–68) functionalized with polyaromatic hydrocarbons by regioselective Lewis base directed electrophilic aromatic substitution. Further investigations were made to find the impact of regioisomeric borylation on the electrochemical, photophysical and structural properties. The Jäkle group95,96 also synthesized a series of B–N fused dipyridylanthracene derivatives (69) with a methyl group at different positions on the pyridyl ring by the electrophilic borylation reaction. Both experimental and computational studies showed the importance of substitutions on the structural motif on electronic and steric properties. The longest B–N distance and least structural distortions were observed with the Me group adjacent to pyridyl N, whereas, the Me group close to anthracene showed severe structural distortions. Further investigations showed the dramatic effect of the position of substitution on the sensitized reaction with O2 and their reversible release with temperature (Fig. 9). The rate of formation of the respective endoperoxides was the fastest for the derivative with the Me group adjacent to pyridyl N and the slowest in the case of the Me group close to the anthracene moiety. These findings will help to design effective sensitizers for singlet oxygen and also provide guidelines to tune the reversibility of the reaction with singlet oxygen.

In 2017, Ingleson and Turner groups97 synthesized ladder-type benzothiadiazole–arylamine D–A type N,C-chelated boron complexes (Fig. 10) through direct electrophilic C–H borylation and successfully studied their photophysical properties (70). The emission properties can be tuned by changing the exocyclic boron substituents by transmetalation with different diaryl-zinc reagents. DFT studies further showed the low HOMO–LUMO gap supported by the highly red shifted absorption spectra of >700 nm. Further tuning with different aryl groups was also studied. The usefulness of these compounds was realized in making OLEDs (71, 72).98 They also studied benzothiadiazole–arylamine donor–acceptor compounds with twisting that exhibited delayed emission (73).99 Polymers of benzothiadiazole–arylamine donor–acceptor compounds were also synthesized and borylated using the post-polymerization methodology (74). The borylated polymers were used to make near-IR-OLEDs and also studied as near-IR emissive bio imaging agents.100 In 2019, the Turner and Ingleson groups101 reported the synthesis of benzoselenadiazole (BSe) and benzotriazole (BTz) based N–C chelate organoboron compounds (75–78). The reaction of BSe and BTz with BCl3 resulted in the C–H functionalization of adjacent aromatic units to form fused boracycles. In situ arylation of boron using organotin or diarylzinc reagents resulted in the formation of air and moisture stable boracycles. Photophysical examination of these boracycles reveals a significant red shift in the absorption and emission spectra in both solution and film states. Among all the compounds, borylated 75 and 76 emitted in the near-infrared spectral region in solution and film states. In 2017, Wakamiya and Murata groups102 reported the synthesis of the dimesitylboryl (Mes2B)-substituted benzothiadiazole derivative (79). Compound 79 showed thermo-, solvato- and mechanochromism assisted by the reversible formation of the intramolecular B–N bond with a sterically bulky Mes2B group. The B–N bond formation lowers the HOMO–LUMO gap which leads to drastic color changes.

In 2016, the Pammer group103 prepared a series of B–N coordinated organoboranes (80–85) through the hydroboration of 2-(ortho-styryl)pyridine with different hydroboranes: 9H-9-borabicyclo[3.3.1]nonyl (9HBBN), BH3·THF, HBCl2·SMe2, HB(C6F5)2, and 9H-9-borafluorene (Fig. 11). This approach was applied to a wide variety of substrates to give products in good to excellent yields with high regioselectivity, under mild reaction conditions. The photophysical and DFT experiments showed that the electronic properties of the synthesized boranes can be tuned by varying the substituents on boron. The same methodology was further extended to104,105 prepare a series of conjugated ladder type B–N coordinated boranes (86, 87) by the two-fold hydroboration reaction of quarterpyridine, pyrimidine, and 1,5-naphthyridine precursors with 9H-BBN and Piers’ boranes ((C6H5)2BH). Photophysical and electrochemical experiments showed that the optical band gaps of these boranes are reduced and their electron affinities are increased to between −3.4 and −4 eV, which make them suitable candidates for use as n-type organic semiconductors. Furthermore, ladder type intramolecular B–N coordinated polymers106 (88–90) were synthesized by the post-modification hydroboration of alkenyl functionalized poly(biphenylene-pyrazinylene) and polypyridines using different hydroboranes (9H-BBN, (C6H5)2B-H (BPF-H), Cl2B-H). The potential application of these polymers as electron acceptors was examined. In 2017, the Pammer group107 synthesized a series of aryl triazole based B–N coordinated boranes (monomers) as well as polymers (91–93). The absorption and emission properties with different aromatic groups (93) were studied in detail. 1H and 11B experiments revealed the presence of thermal exchange between open non-coordinated and closed B–N coordinated conformers. Fluorescence experiments of monomeric units reveal the effect of substituents. Polymers showed fluorescence lifetimes and quantum yields of 23–11 ns and 17–6% respectively.108
 Fig. 11  The chemical structure of N,C-chelate boron compounds 80–93. 
In 2016, the Yam group109 prepared a series of thiophene based spirofluorene ladder type boracycles (94–95) and studied their electrochemistry and photophysical properties. Absorption and emission experiments reveal intramolecular charge transfer from thiophene to the pyridine-borane unit. Emission spectra showed a structureless band assigned to intramolecular charge transfer transition. Interestingly, all the boron compounds exhibit high emission quantum yields up to 81% in the solution state and 86% in the thin film state. Some of the molecules were used to fabricate OLEDs which showed an EQE up to 1.3% with tuneable emission from blue, green to red. In 2017, the Chi group110 designed and synthesized donor–acceptor type boron compounds 96–98 (Fig. 12) with phenylpyridine as the electron acceptor (A) and triphenyl carbazole/triphenyl amine as the electron donor (D). The TADF properties of these D–A units with boron as a linker were investigated in various solvents. The OLED device fabricated using these N,C-chelated tetra-coordinated compounds makes these as efficient TADF OLED materials. Donor–spiro–acceptor based N,C-chelated boron complexes also act as promising TADF materials.111

In 2018,112 borylated arylisoquinoline skeletons having a helicene like structure were reported (99). The enantiomers of the helicene showed remarkable electronic circular dischroism (ECD) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) with a significant dissymmetry factor. Recently, the Nowak-Krol group113 applied a modular approach to isolate two types of helically chiral compounds (Fig. 12) having one and two boron atoms (100, 101). Azabora[7]helicenes exhibit blue or green fluorescence with a solution state quantum yield ranging between 18 and 24%. They also exhibit green or yellow emission in the solid state with a quantum yield up to 23%. Azabora[9]helicenes exhibit blue fluorescence with quantum yields up to 47% in the solution state and 25% in the solid state. To reveal the importance of excited-state energy alignment, Adachi and co-workers114 designed and synthesized spiro-type N–C chelate B–N coordinated boron derivatives based on 2-phenylpyridinato. Various studies showed that the triplet excited state of the donor and acceptor units plays a vital role in high quantum yields of exciplexes. Further investigations reveal that efficient TADF can be achieved when triplet charge-transfer excited state and triplet local excited state energy levels are aligned to allow reverse intersystem crossing (RISC). B–N coordinated thiophene-pyrimidine based ladder type molecules were reported by the Huang group (102).115 Polymerization of the same backbone resulted in red shifted absorption, low lying energy levels and ambipolar transport characteristics. All-polymer solar cells constructed using the B–N coordinated thiophene-pyrimidine conjugated polymer as an acceptor showed efficiency up to 8% (103, 104).116
Our group117 designed and synthesized a series of B–N coordinated N–C-chelated tetrahydrodibenzo[a,i]phenanthridine-based polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (not shown). Photophysical studies reveal moderate molar extinction coefficients from 15800–38700 M−1 cm−1 with absorption maxima ranging between 368 and 420 nm. The emission of complexes showed a red shifted band with respect to their respective ligands. A similar methodology was also adopted to make118 phenanthroimidazole based boron compounds (105). All the compounds showed moderate to good quantum yields in the solution state and moderate solid state quantum yields.
In addition to that we also explored the synthesis of B–N coordinated N,C-chelated phenanthroimidazole and triaryl pyrazole based dimers (Fig. 13; 106–109).119,120 Photophysical studies revealed that the phenanthroimidazole and triaryl pyrazole based dimers exhibited considerable red shift absorption over the monomeric borylated systems due to the increased conjugation length. Fluorescence experiments of phenanthroimidazole dimers showed intense emission maxima ranging from 418 nm to 480 nm with excellent quantum yields up to 99% in the solution state and moderate quantum yields in the solid state. This suggested that energy lost through the non-radiative process is minimal in dimers. Furthermore, we explored the nonlinear optical properties of phenanthroimidazole dimers and showed the correlation between the conjugation length and two-photon-absorption cross-section.120 Photophysical studies of triaryl pyrazole based dimers reveal that all the B–N coordinated pyrazole dimers exhibit good molar absorption coefficients and also quantum yields of up to 94% in the solution state. Owing to a considerable change in the excited state dipole moment, B–N coordinated pyrazole dimers were further explored for their nonlinear optical (NLO) properties. Further studies reveal that these compounds displayed remarkable NLO properties that were versatile and considerably large. The dimer symmetry and the presence of acceptor or donor motifs affect the two-photon-absorption (TPA) cross-section considerably. Apart from that, the investigation reveals that the π-conjugation length in all dimer variants has an incredible impact on the nonlinear optical characteristics. An aryl isoquinoline based B–N coordinated monomeric and dimeric system was reported by Pischel with good photostability and TPA cross section up to 220 GM at 700 nm.121

N,O-chelate B–N coordinated compounds
Since the exemplary work on 8-hydroxyquinolate-boron compounds reported by Wang and co-workers,122 a number of N,O-chelate B–N coordinated boron compounds have been reported. Among the different nitrogen coordinated N,O-chelated boron compounds, imine coordinated compounds were studied by different groups, and their photophysical properties were tuned by introducing different substituents.123–133 Compounds (110) with an imine framework as shown in Fig. 14, reported by Chujo and co-workers125 showed mechanochromic and AIE properties. The emission color of crystalline samples changed from red to orange on grinding with an agate mortar. The crystal structure, powder XRD and DSC analyses suggested that the origin of the mechanochromic properties was from the phase transition between amorphous and crystalline states. Reversible mechanochromism was observed on heating and cooling as well. Compound 111 (with R1 = OCH3, R2 = H)131 and 112127 reported by the Dai and Yang group showed AIE and mechanochromic properties, respectively. Compound 112 was responsive to external stimuli like grinding and vapors of acids/bases. The mechanochromic properties were supported by PXRD and TEM experiments which showed the change of the crystalline phase to amorphous phase. Compounds 113 and 114 reported by Thilagar and co-workers (Fig. 15)134 also showed mechanochromic properties. Compounds 113–116 exhibit phosphorescence emission with lifetime values from 18–46 ms.

In 2016, the Yam group126 reported the synthesis of compounds 117–124 (Fig. 16) and investigated the steric effect on the photocyclization process. They found that phenyl substitution on the N-atom of the β-ketoiminate core suppressed the photocyclization process. When the phenyl group was replaced by mesityl units, the recovery of the photochromic properties was observed. From these observations, it was proposed that intramolecular rotations were responsible for the photocyclization process. Coumarin-based N,O-chelate BF2 compounds (125, 126)130 were studied for their aggregation induced emission properties. The compounds exhibit red-shifted emission (red emission) in CH3CN with an increasing fraction of water due to the formation of J-aggregates. Both the compounds showed large Stokes shifts, and particularly in the solid state they exhibited red emission at 650 nm with a Stokes shift of 170 nm. As they showed good membrane permeability, they were used as lysosome trackers.132 Aryl(heteroaryl)-thiophene based N,O-chelated BF2 compounds 127–137 were studied for their potential applications in bio-imaging. The impressive fluorescence properties of these compounds were tested for bio-imaging applications in HeLa cells, and showed low-toxicity, good permeation ability and excellent fluorescence character.
 Fig. 16  The chemical structure of N,O-chelate boron compounds 117–137. 
Pyridine, phenanthridine, pyrimidine, naphthyridine, isoquinoline, quinoline, quinoxaline, quinazolinones and hydroxyquinoline, based nitrogen coordinated N,O-chelated tetra-coordinated boron compounds have been synthesized by different groups and studied for their photophysical properties. The type of aryl group, spacers and mode of coordination had influence on the photophysical properties of the resultant products.135–169 The Lu group142,149 synthesized N,O-chelated BF2 compounds 138–142 (Fig. 17). Compound 138 exhibits two types of crystals, a yellow ribbon like (Y-crystal) and green needle-like crystal (G-crystal). The Y-crystal exhibits yellow emission at 518 nm in THF solution whereas the G-crystal exhibits green emission at 495 nm in a CH2Cl2/pet-ether solution mixture. J-type aggregation was found in the Y-crystal. Upon grinding, both Y- and G-crystals exhibit mechanochromism behavior. The ground powders of Y- and G-crystals exhibit yellow emission at 533 nm. Upon fuming with CH2Cl2 or on heating, the emission color of the sample recovered to their initial crystal states. This reversible mechanochromism was confirmed by PXRD experiments where the XRD pattern revealed recovery to their initial crystal structures. Compound 139 and 140 exhibited strong emission due to ICT, whereas 141 and 142 showed weak emission due to the lack of the ICT. Compounds 139 and 140 exhibited high-contrast mechanochromism behavior in comparison to 141. On step-wise grinding, 139 showed multi-color response to mechanic force which was due to the disturbances of π-aggregates in the solid states. Compound 140 also showed mechanochromic behaviour which changes the emission color from yellow to orange upon grinding. The ground amorphous powder of 140 returned to its crystalline state on keeping it at room temperature for 5 min. Compound 141 showed low-contrast reversible mechanochromism and 142 did not show any mechanochromism behaviour due to the lack of ICT. Boron compounds 143–146148 showed weak solution state fluorescence but exhibited strong fluorescence in the solid state. On further investigation it was found that they exhibit AIE in the THF/water solvent system. On increasing the water concentration, the fluorescence intensity increases. X-ray analysis showed that the weak interactions might be responsible for the AIE. Interestingly, 146 showed mechanochromism and on grinding changed the emission color from green (491 nm) to yellow-green (509 nm). Analogous pyridine based N,O-chelated compounds with a framework of 147 were synthesized by copper catalyzed C–H activation; the synthesized compounds169 showed excellent AIE in the THF/H2O mixture and also bright solid state emission.

In 2015, Matsui and co-workers reported137 pyrimidine based BF2/BPh2 compounds 148–157 (Fig. 17) and studied the effect of substitution on solution and solid state emission. In the solid state, –H, –CF3 and –CN substituted boranes showed higher emission and better quantum yields than in the solution state and on further investigation they found these derivatives to be AIE active. Solvent viscosity and temperature effects on fluorescence of these compounds (–H, –CF3 and –CN substituted) proved that the AIE originated due to the restricted intramolecular C–Ar rotation. The same group exploited the pyrimidine frame to make diboron compounds147 with different substituents on phenyl rings (158–162). Pyridine coordinated boron compounds 163 and 164 (Fig. 18) were studied by the He and Liu groups.141 Photophysical investigations revealed that due to intramolecular rotation in low viscous solvents, compounds 163 and 164 exhibit low emissions. In relatively high viscous solvents, both the complexes showed enhanced emission due to restriction of intramolecular rotation. This resulted in the aggregation induced enhanced emission (AIEE) and high solid state emission (0.53 for 163 and 0.46 for 164). Crystal structure analysis revealed that weak intermolecular interactions like C–H⋯F and C–H⋯π were responsible for intense emission in the solid state. Quinazolinone based BF2 compounds of the framework 165 with various substituents on the phenolate ring also showed the AIEE phenomenon.168

Naphthyridine140,164 and pyrimidine158 based BF2 compounds were synthesized and studied for their potential applications in biochemistry (166–169). N,O-chelated naphthyridine based boron compounds 166 and 167 were studied as probes for the detection of phosphate ions. Both the compounds showed excellent selectivity for the detection of phosphate ion over other phosphate based species. Upon the addition of phosphate ions to a solution of 166 and 167, fluorescence quenching was observed. The in vivo cell imaging using HeLa and Caenorhabditis elegans was successfully performed using the above mentioned compounds. The interaction of naphthyridine based BF2 compounds (168) with proteins such as calf-thymus DNA, human serum albumin (HSA), acetylcholinesterase and tyrosinase enzymes via spectroscopic analysis under physiological conditions, combined with molecular docking simulations was studied. The boron compounds furnished moderate binding towards HSA via the ground-state association. Fang and co-workers156 synthesized hydroxyquinoline based tetra-coordinated N,O-chelate (170–173) boron polymers. Devices made of the polymers 170–173 (Fig. 18) were used to discriminate volatile small organic molecules. The tetra-coordinated structure of the boron centre was responsible for the fast and reversible sensing of the polymers. The mono boron compound 174162 was studied for its mechanochromic properties. Interestingly, compound 174 displayed three unique crystalline states and an amorphous state and each one of them exhibited different luminescent colors. All the four states showed reversible mechanochromic behavior on grinding and heating. They further utilized this phenomenon for color painting with a single ink. Some of the N,O-chelated compounds (168)159 were studied for their application in two-photon absorption (2PA). Two derivatives showed the highest 2PA cross-section of 268 GM at 990 nm and 156 GM at 590 nm, respectively. They showed efficient internal charge transfer due to the increased conjugation length with simpler structures which make them potential molecules for nonlinear applications in the visible and near infrared regions.
In 2018, the Ye group155 synthesized pyrimidine-containing β-iminoenolates as ligands and their BF2 complexes (175 and 176). Compound 176 (Fig. 19) has tert-butyl substitution on the carbazole moiety whereas 175 does not contain any substitution. They found that a ligand and a boron-compound with tert-butyl substitution can self-assemble to form organogels in the methylcyclohexane/1,4-dioxane solvent system. It was proposed that π–π interactions were responsible for the gelation of compound 176. Fluorescence experiments showed that the gel-based film of 176 could be used as “turn-off” fluorescent sensor for TFA vapor. Further investigations revealed that the boron compounds showed reversible mechanochromism. Tetra-coordinate boron compounds160 consisting of tridentate 2,2′-(pyridine-2,6-diyl)diphenolate fused with carbazole or 10H-spiro[acridine-9,9′-fluorene] or 9,9-dimethyl-9,10-dihydroacridine were recently reported (177–179). These compounds showed high performances with a current efficiency of 55.7 cd A−1, high power efficiency of 58.4 Im W−1 and external quantum efficiency of 18% on using them as vacuum-deposited OLEDs.

In an analogous fashion benzothiazole, pyrazoline, oxadiazole, benzimidazole, benzoxazole, thiadiazole, imidazole, thiazole, imidazole-pyridine and phenanthroimidazole based B–N coordinated tetra-coordinated boron compounds were synthesized and studied for their optical properties.170–189 Among the different boron-compounds reported: 180, 181,188184, 185,177186–192,176 and 193178 (Fig. 20) exhibited aggregation induced emission (AIE) and reversible mechanochromic properties.
 Fig. 20  The chemical structure of N,O-chelate boron compounds 180–193. 
The effect of cyano-group substitution177 on AIE and mechanochromic properties was studied by synthesizing thiazole-based β-diketoiminate borates 182–185 (Fig. 20). Cyano-substituted borates 182 and 183 exhibited AIE and reversible mechanochromic properties. High electron affinity and steric hindrance caused by the –CN group resulted in twisted conformations which ultimately helped in gaining AIE and reversible mechanochromic properties. On grinding, 182 changed the emission color from yellow to orange (542 to 599 nm) and 183 changed color from bright yellow to orange (549 to 566 nm) which can be reversible on fuming. Interestingly, neither 184 nor 185 showed signs of AIE or mechanochromic properties, which may be due to the lack of twisted conformations caused by the absence of the –CN group. From these results it was concluded that the cyano group plays an important role in acquiring strong ICT behavior and AIE and mechanochromic properties. Among the seven BF2-compounds (186–192) studied by Lu and co-workers176186 and 189 exhibited the AIE phenomenon and mechanochromism, respectively. In 2017, Gao et al.178 synthesized and characterized two thiazole based β-ketoiminate borates with tetraphenylethene units. Both the compounds showed AIE and reversible mechanochromic properties. The mechanochromic behavior of 193 (R = CN) is more pronounced than that of 193 (R = H) which was due to the presence of the –CN group. On grinding 193 (R = H) changed its emission color from bright green (497 nm) to yellow-green (515 nm) and 193 (R = CN) changed the emission color from yellow-green (525 nm) to yellow (565 nm). The origin of the mechanochromism was studied using PXRD and DSC studies.
Recently, the Lu group189 reported donor–π-acceptor type N,O-chelated BF2 compounds (Fig. 21; 194–197) in which tert-butylcarbazole units and N-heterocycles were connected via an amide bond. In these compounds, BF2 units act as donors and tert-butyl substituted carbazole units act as acceptors. They explored the self-assembly, sensing and mechanoluminescence of these compounds. Compound 197 easily self-assembled to form gels in different organic solvents like cyclohexane, methylcyclohexane, DMSO, CH2Cl2/n-hexane, and CH2Cl2/petroleum ether. Titration experiments with TFA revealed that 197 showed high performance for TFA detection in comparison to 194, 195 and 199. Solid state emission experiments revealed that 197 exhibited high contrast reversible mechanochromic behaviour as well. In 2020, the Potopnyk group187 developed a transition-metal-free post-functionalization of thiazole based organoboron compounds by the direct lithiation of the 1,3-thiazole ring. This method allowed a variety of substitutions including –C, –Hal, –Si, –S, –Se and –Sn substituents by the regioselective C–H modification of the organoboron compounds (198). They also studied the effect of the donor/acceptor strength on the photophysical properties. Boron compound 198 with SnBu3 substitution showed a high solid state photoluminescence quantum yield of 0.44. Benzimidazole, imidazole and phenanthroimidazole173,184 based, B–N coordinated compounds 199–202 were studied for their applications in OLEDs. The device made using these materials showed good performance.
 Fig. 21  The chemical structure of N,O-chelate boron compounds 194–202. 
We synthesized a series of imidazole based B–N coordinated boron compounds (Fig. 22; 203–212).171,175,190 The optical properties were tuned by changing the aryl groups on the imidazole. All the boron compounds exhibited large Stokes shifts and moderate quantum yields. Electroluminescent devices fabricated using compounds 203–205 reveal that they are capable of transporting electrons. When 203 was used as an electron-transporting material, a maximum brightness of 6450 cd m−2 at 12.5 V was observed. Furthermore, N,N-dimethyl/diphenylamine decorated imidazole based fluorescent borates showed the selective detection of picric acid (PA) (Fig. 23). Fluorometric titration experiments with PA showed the quenching of the emission band at 496 nm for compound 211 and 457 nm for compound 212. Structural and 1H-NMR studies revealed that the proton abstraction of PA by the amine functionality along with weak interactions was responsible for the selectivity. In 2015, the Wang, Liu and Le groups170 prepared four propeller type BF2/BPh2 compounds 213, 214 based on benzothiazole-enolate bidendate ligands and studied their AIE properties. Boron compounds 213 and 214 showed weak fluorescence in low-viscosity solvents and tend to aggregate with enhanced luminescence in high-viscous organic solvents. The restriction and relaxation of intramolecular rotation in viscous and non-viscous solvents respectively resulted in enhanced and quenched fluorescence. These compounds also showed a high solid state quantum yield ranging from 14 to 43%. Intense luminescence in the solid state was explained by C–H⋯F and C–H⋯π intermolecular interactions. In 2018, Wakamiya and co-workers191 synthesized a D–A–D type diboron BF2 compound with azafulvene, which showed extremely good electron accepting properties. Photophysical studies showed that compound 215 exhibits an intense NIR absorption band at 922 nm, and it should be noted that there is no absorption observed in the visible region. X-ray analysis showed that π-conjugation increased upon B–N coordination which is responsible for the high electron accepting ability.

N,N-chelate B–N coordinated compounds
The compounds with the boron center chelated by two nitrogen atoms and two other donor atoms to form a five or six membered ring are categorized as N,N-chelate boron compounds. Although, boron-dipyrromethene (BODIPY) dyes also come under this category, they are not discussed here, owing to several recent reviews.192–194
Since the exemplary synthesis of bis(difluoroboron)1,2-bis((pyrrol-2-yl)methylene) hydrazine (BOPHY) by the Ziegler group195 and Jiao group,196 many BOPHYs were reported by different groups to obtain better photophysical properties (216). Various substituents linked to the framework of the bispyrrole-boron were studied.197–216 Although, most of the studies reported a six-membered ring formation, in 2016, Shen and co-workers reported197 both five and six membered ring formation using hydrazine-Schiff base linked bispyrrole. Compound 217 (six-membered-ring) showed efficient solid-state fluorescence owing to the weak intermolecular interactions and a large Stokes shift, whereas, compound 218 (five-membered-ring) has a small Stokes shift which results in weak fluorescence in the solid-state via self-quenching. BOPHY 219 was used for the preparation of new triplet photosensitizers.200 Nanosecond time-resolved transient absorption spectra reveal the presence of a long-lived triplet state for compound 219 with a triplet excited state lifetime of 177.2 μs. Recently, Jiao and co-workers216 reported a new family of BOPHYs with N2O-chelated boron compounds via a one-pot condensation of hydrazine, formylisoindole, and different organoboronic acids. Compounds 220–222 (Fig. 24) showed bright near-infrared fluorescence in both solution and solid state. Furthermore, pyridinium derivative 222 has been studied for fluorescence imaging in HeLa cells. Jiao and co-workers further explored the hydrazine chemistry to make another class of materials with pyrrole and N-heteroarenes which they call BOPPYs (not shown).217
 Fig. 24  The chemical structure of N,N-chelate boron compounds 216–223. 
AIE-active tetraphenyl ethylene incorporated BINOL based chiral BOPHYs (Fig. 24; 223) were designed and synthesized by Cheng and co-workers.203 Both R and S-enantiomers (R/S223) exhibit emission enhancement in CH2Cl2/hexane, however, in THF/H2O fluorescence quenching was realized. Interestingly, both the enantiomers showed reversal aggregation-induced circular dichroism from solution to aggregation in the THF/H2O mixture owing to the axial chirality transfer in the aggregation state. BOPHY derivatives were also used for the detection of Cu2+ ions,205 as non-linear optical materials,212 and as photocatalysts.211,215 Werz and co-workers explored the synthesis of a new class of boron based fluorophores 224, 225 (Fig. 25) namely bis(borondifluoride)-8-imidazodipyrromethene (BOIMPY).218–221 The benzimidazole- and tetrazole-based BOIMPY dyes showed red and near-infrared fluorescence. The optical properties of the BOIMPY dyes including heavy atom effects and also the feasibility of BOIMPYs as photosensitizers were investigated by the Jacquemin and Simone groups using theoretical methods.222,223
 Fig. 25  The chemical structure of N,N-chelate boron compounds 224–233. 
Lee and co-workers224 reported another class of BOIMPYs (226) using imino pyrrolide ligands. The low symmetry of these molecules allows to access charge transfer type excited states with large Stokes shifts. The usefulness of the BOIMPY motif was studied as a bioprobe. Gomes and co-workers reported various pyrrolyl boron compounds (227, 228) and explored their application in organic light emitting diodes.225–228 Azahelicene-incorporated N,N-chelated BF2 compounds were synthesized and studied as circularly polarized luminescent materials by Ema and co-workers229 Recently, the chemistry of B–N coordinated boron-formazanate compounds has attracted attention owing to their interesting photophysical properties.230–236 The Gilroy group designed and synthesized a serious of formazanate based tetra-coordinated boron compounds; for instance, the amine-substituted BF2 formazanate showed NIR emission (229–232)234 whereas the N-annulated pherylenediimide coupled compound 233 is utilized in making organic photovoltaics.232 Indole-pyridine, hydrazine, pyrrolyl-acylhydrazone, bipyridyl, pyridyl pyrrolide and semihemiporphyrazine based boron compounds were also studied for their tuneable photophysical properties.237–246
Conclusions
In summary, we have provided an overview of the recent advances in the design of tetra-coordinated boron based luminescent materials. This perspective considered anionic O,O- N,C-, N,O- and N,N-chelate (without BODIPY) ligands. Many of the newly synthesized fluorophores displayed attractive photophysical properties, some of them showed interesting aggregation induced emission, mechanochromism and solvatochromism. The tetra-coordinated boron compounds as NIR65 and blue247 OLEDs, sensitizers for singlet oxygen,95 circularly polarized luminescence,229 and two photon absorption with high brightness248 have emerged as excellent developments of these materials. In some instances the boron-based materials have shown better properties over pure organic materials.74 Although, the chemistry of tetra-coordinated boron compounds has progressed greatly, future developments could involve tuning the substitutions (ligand) for specific applications around the boron center, introducing different chelating atoms other than O,O-, N,C-, N,O- and N,N- and making water soluble boron-based fluorophores. We hope that this perspective will inspire the design of new tetra-coordinated boron based fluorophores and exploration of their properties and applications.
