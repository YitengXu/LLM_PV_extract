    , Accepted 28th December 2021First published on 19th January 2022AbstractOver the last decades, MoS2, being a member of the transition metal dichalcogenide family, is the second most extensively studied 2D-material, followed by graphene. Owing to its distinct electronic structure and outstanding physical and chemical properties. Being a widely used semiconductor material, some directions of its applications are still limited. The semiconducting 2H-phase of MoS2 shows less catalytic activity due to the presence of a large number of chemically inert basal planes, whereas the metallic 1T-phase of MoS2, which exhibits higher catalytic activity, cannot be furnished on a large scale due to the stabilization issue. Taking these demerits into consideration, the current researchers are highly dedicated to ameliorating the catalytic performance of MoS2 by activating the chemically inert basal planes of MoS2. There occurs a generation of new catalytic active centers on the basal plane of MoS2 in addition to its active edge sites, which elevates its catalytic activity, i.e., electrocatalytic HER. In view of this, the current review sheds light on several methodologies for the activation of inert basal plane of MoS2 including doping, etching, creating sulphur vacancies, and pores, which is of great importance toward boosting the catalytic execution of MoS2.Sarmistha DasSarmistha Das earned her Master in Science (MSc) in Chemistry from Berhampur University, Odisha, India in 2017.

1 Introduction
In this modern epoch, due to the rising global energy demands and activities of human society, the world is dealing with two prior issues, i.e., polluted environment and exhaustion of fossil fuels.1–3 For decades, the decrease in fossil fuel reserves has compelled scientists to continuously work on discovering highly efficient eco-friendly strategies for energy conversion.4–7 Among all, hydrogen production techniques are the best alternative to handle these issues. Hydrogen is considered a clean, non-toxic, and most promising form of carbon-free energy alternative that can be generated at higher rates compared to natural, permanent, and renewable resources.8–10 Water splitting for molecular hydrogen production via the electrocatalytic process has the most suitable and cost-effective strategies in the current research. HER, being an appealing approach, has gained appreciable attention because (a) hydrogen behaves as an energy carrier that can be applied for fuel cells in the near future, and (b) pure hydrogen is supplied under ambient conditions by the HER.
1.1 Basic mechanism of HER
HER proceeds in an electrolytic cell consisting of electrolytes and electrodes and is regulated through the production of electricity from natural resources such as wind and solar power.11,12 Basically, the overall HER mechanism (in acidic as well as in alkaline) is governed through two widely accepted mechanisms named as Volmer–Heyrovsky and Volmer–Tafel mechanism, which proceed through three steps of the reaction. The step-by-step HER mechanism is illustrated from eqn (1)–(8). It has been seen that two electron transfers takes place in both the reactions steps, followed by the formation of atomic hydrogen chemisorbed as the intermediate on the surface of the catalyst, which determines the rate of overall HER.13–15
Acidic medium: 2H+ + 2e− → H2(g)(1) H3O+ + e− → Hads + H2O (Volmer)(2) 2Hads → H2 (Tafel)(3) H3O+ + Hads + e− → H2 + H2O (Heyrovsky)(4)
Alkaline medium: 2H2O + 2e− → H2(g) + 2OH(aq)−(5) 2H2O + 2e− → 2Hads + 2OH− (Volmer)(6) 2Hads → H2 (Tafel)(7) Hads + H2O + e− → H2 + OH− (Heyrovsky)(8)
Nevertheless, the high HER performance is determined by various important parameters such as Gibbs free energy for hydrogen adsorption (ΔGH*), Tafel slope, over potential, current density, and electrochemically active surface area (ECSA). Based upon the Sabatier principle, from the volcano plot, one can deduce the rate of adsorption of hydrogen on the surface of the catalyst as well as reaction intermediates, which should be minimal, i.e., neither very strong nor very poor along with lower thermodynamic overpotential.16,17 In order to exclude the resistance of the electrolytic solution, the overpotential is corrected for iR drop for intrinsic HER performance by taking reversible hydrogen electrode (R.H.E.) as the reference.
By adopting eqn (9), one can calculate the value of Gibbs free energy for hydrogen adsorption. ΔG0H = ΔEH + ΔEZPE − TΔSH(9)
From the above equation, the term ΔEH, ΔEZPE, and ΔSH corresponds to the differential chemisorption energy, difference in zero-point energy, and difference in entropy between the adsorbed state of the system as well as gas phase state, respectively.
To further demonstrate the HER catalytic efficiency of the electrocatalyst, the Tafel slope is taken in to consideration via the electron density measurement, i.e., polarization curve obtained in Linear Sweep Voltammetry. By fitting the linear part of the Tafel plot to eqn (10), we can easily determine the Tafel slope as well as current density, which thus derives whether the first or second step is rate determining.17,18 |η| = a + blogj(10)where, η is the overpotential, a is the Tafel constant, and b is the Tafel slope, which is represented as b = 2.3RT/αnF (R = ideal gas constant, T = absolute temperature, α = electrochemical transfer co-efficient, n = number of electrons take part in the electrode reaction, and F = faradaic constant) and j represents the current density. From the theoretical as well as experimental aspects, the electrocatalyst with small Tafel slope along with high current density possesses reduced overpotential value. From the DFT studies, the rate determining step ascribed on the Tafel slope value, which is 120 mV dec−1, 40 mV dec−1, and 30 mV dec−1 for Volmer, Heyrovsky, and Tafel reactions, respectively.18 Initially, Pt is regarded as the best HER performing catalyst due to its low overpotential, low Tafel slope, zero ΔGH*, and high current density but due to many limitations, recent studies have focused on earth abundant materials, which are inexpensive and environment-friendly. However, the search of a sustainable as well as proficient catalyst as the electrode toward efficient HER at a near zero over potential is becoming the topic of discussion in the current research. At present, Pt along with other noble metals have emerged as the most efficient HER electrocatalyst but their expensive and scarcity nature restricts their widespread use in HER application.19,20
Followed by the remarkable discovery of graphene, several 2D layered materials flourished, from which transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have attracted tremendous interest toward themselves.21–23 In the recent decades, various transition metal dichalcogenides have been explored including MoSe2,24 MoS2,20,25–29 WS2,30 and WSe2 (ref. 31) owing to their unique physicochemical properties as cheap non-Pt catalysts for HER. Amidst several members of TMDs, molybdenum disulphide (MoS2) being a representative of this family has revealed itself as the most eligible, encouraging, and competitive electrocatalyst toward HER because of its excellent chemical stability, tunable bandgap properties, enhanced activity, inexpensive cost, eco-friendly nature, and abundance in nature.32–35 After graphene, MoS2 is the second most elaborately studied two-dimensional material toward energy and environment-related benefits including energy storage, electronic devices, and energy conversion.36–39 The MoS2 crystal contains three atomic layers designed in a tri-layer manner, i.e., one molybdenum layer interlocked in between two sulphur layers is characterized by the existence of strong covalent bonding between them.13,40 In accordance to the atomic stacking order, MoS2 persists in more than one crystal phases and out of them, the semiconducting 2H phase and metallic 1T phase are most extensively studied phases of MoS2.9,13,41,42 The semiconducting 2H-MoS2 is the most stable and copiously available material on Earth while the metallic 1T-MoS2 needs to be synthesized using various approaches.13,41,42 2H-MoS2 in its bulk form is a semiconductor having an indirect bandgap of 1.29 eV, while it has a direct bandgap of 1.9 eV when it is reduced to monolayer 2H-MoS2,43,44 thereby exposing itself as a trending material in various sectors.45–47 The major shortcoming of 2H-MoS2, which pulls it back in the race of competing semiconductor materials, is the chemically inert basal planes along with a surface area that is smaller than the active edge sites.48 However, the catalytic active sites of 2H-MoS2 are known to be originated from the edges rather than the basal planes.9,13,41 Many approaches have been made toward the development of 2H-MoS2 so that it can expose its maximum efficiency toward HER catalytic activity. Firstly, the density of the exposed edge sites can be increased in the case of 2H-MoS2 or additional sulphur vacancies can be produced on the basal planes of MoS2 to increase the number of active sites. However, these methods are often obstructed due to the electron deficiency at the reaction interface because of the semiconducting properties of 2H-phase MoS2.49,50 Secondly, one of them is the fabrication of the mixed-phase 1T/2H-MoS2 by incorporating the 1T metallic phase into the 2H semiconducting phase of MoS2, showing outstanding catalytic performance.13 In the case of 1T-MoS2, despite dense sulphur atoms on both the edges and basal planes as the active sites, the hydrogen adsorption properties of these sulphur centers are not profitable for HER.51 One of the main problems associated with 1T and 2H phase MoS2 is the decrease in the stability due to an increase in the leaching rate of sulphur in 2H-MoS250 and the metastable nature of 1T-MoS2.52 Still, the conversion of 2H-MoS2 to 1T-MoS2 is achieved along with improved catalytic activity by the insertion of alkaline metal ions such as Li+. But in this case too, the as-formed metastable 1T phase MoS2 gets reformed back to the most stable 2H-MoS2 due to low binding strength in between MoS2 and the alkaline atoms.53 Also, it has been observed that beyond a certain temperature, the highly unstable 1T-MoS2 formed gets restacked to the most stable 2H-MoS2, thereby setting a limitation for the above approach.54 To overcome this limitation, another path is approached, i.e., the activation of catalytic sites on the basal plane of MoS2 for HER performance that has evolved to be a hot topic in today's scientific community. Despite achieving great progress, very few studies are noted to have attempted the effective and controllable activation of the basal planes by generating more vacancy defects or by introducing pores onto the basal planes via several procedures to exhibit intense catalytic performance. Lei et al.55 in his review on 2D-MoS2 provided information regarding different aspects of MoS2 including several synthetic methods for its basal plane activation along with a wide range of application in various fields. Similarly, Meng et al.56 and Yang Cao57 also published a review regarding basal plane activation of MoS2 toward HER. With this concern, herein, we aim to present our current review encapsulating the advances achieved till date regarding the activation of chemically inert basal planes of MoS2 and focusing on its application as an HER catalyst in a different and convenient way.
In this review, considering MoS2 as a standard material, we have made an attempt to provide a basic outlook regarding the activation of the inert basal planes of MoS2. In addition, several methods employed for inducing catalytic active sites on the basal plane of MoS2 are presented before the public eye. This review also sheds light on the performance of the basal plane-activated MoS2 as an efficient electrocatalyst toward the hydrogen evolution reaction. Finally, we have put forth our perspectives toward future research as well as highlighted the challenges and opportunities for promoting and upgrading this unique material.
2 Fabrication strategies toward basal plane activation of MoS2
As the basal plane of MoS2 has been confirmed to be electrochemically inert, hence it is not taken into count as a source of contribution toward the catalytic activity. As a result, the electrocatalytic HER activity is known to arise from its edge sites only. Therefore, if successful activation of the inert basal plane sites of MoS2 can be achieved along with maintaining the active edge sites, then the HER performance of MoS2 will be highly enhanced. Several methods employed to activate the catalytic sites on the inert basal planes of MoS2, as displayed in Scheme 1, are extensively discussed in the following section. In addition, different synthetic methods with advantages and disadvantages are described in Table 1.

2.1 Doping
Out of several methodologies developed to date, doping MoS2 with various transition metal atoms and non-metals is an effective way for enhancing the activity of MoS2 toward HER. The doping of elements can tune the surface electronic state and thereby help in enhancing the intrinsic conductivity of molybdenum sulphide. This proves to be favorable for the fast transfer of electrons among the active sites on the basal plane of MoS2.

2.1.1 Metal doping. 
Lau et al.58 have demonstrated the systematic experimental steps in order to expose the basal planes with more active surface sites of single-layered exfoliated MoS2 with and without the doping of transition metals. The use of several transition metal atoms to form metal-doped MoS2 nanosheets has great impact on the electronic nature and catalytic HER activities owing to the geometric characteristics and binding affinities between the transition metal atoms and the surface sites. The monolayer MoS2 nanosheets were obtained from the bulk MoS2 precursor by BuLi intercalation and are doped with different single transition metal atoms via the hydrothermal doping method (i.e., Fe, Co, Ni, and Ag) as shown in Fig. 1a. Among these transition metal atom-doped MoS2 nanosheets, Ni–MoS2 and Co–MoS2 are studied in detail. It has been found that Co shows greater affinity toward sulphur sites in order to create Co–S interaction on the surface but is not able to be attached on the Mo sites. On the other hand, Ni can bind to the Mo sites, causing Ni–Mo interaction because of its stereospecificity in metal–metal bond formation. Fig. 1b shows the placement of Co atom on the top site of the trigonal prismatic Mo atom and the incorporation of Co atom into the sulphur vacant site, respectively. Fig. 1c represents the electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) obtained before, on, and after the presence of Co atom on top of the Mo site by green, dark blue, and khaki color, respectively. At the expected energy level, the L3, 2 edges appear on the EELS obtained from the Co atom on top of the Mo site and is absent in other two EELS. However, for Ni–MoS2, the L3, 2 characteristic edges obtained in the EELS (Fig. 1d) in red color confirms the existence of Ni atom at the Mo position in comparison to the green and blue lines representing before and after the existence of Ni atom. Further, in the ADF image in Fig. 1e, a larger peak is obtained, which is due to the doping of Ni on the top of the molybdenum atom, confirming the successful doping of Ni atom. Similarly, Zheng et al.59 modified MoS2 by reporting the technique of confining both Se and Co in the surface as well as the inner layer of the MoS2 lattice, respectively, simultaneously enabling the edge stabilization, basal plane activation, and maximally enhancing the hydrogen adsorption performance.

To overcome the instability of the 1T phase at higher temperatures, Luo et al.60 in his work prepared basal plane-activated MoS2 using palladium via spontaneous interfacial redox technique (Fig. 1f), which involves a thermodynamically favored double step reaction. Firstly, a thermodynamically favored spontaneous reaction occurs, resulting in the reduction and oxidation of Pd and Mo(III), respectively, forming the Mo vacancies. Followed by this, Pd gets associated with the Mo vacancies by getting into the MoS2 framework, resulting in the formation of the stable Pd–S bond. Further, Mo(IV) is reduced to Mo(III) by electron injection into MoS2 substrates, leading to the removal of sulphur from the MoS2 basal plane, thereby successfully forming the sulphur vacancies. The atomic doping of Pd varying from 1% to 15% was done onto the original Mo sites, leading to the formation of sulphur vacancies along with the conversion as well as activation of the 1T phase basal plane from 2H-phase MoS2. The XPS spectra in Fig. 1g confirms the presence of Pd by displaying two characteristic peaks at 336.7 and 342 eV for 3d5/2 and 3d3/2, respectively. Fig. 1h represents the EXAFS spectra of the Mo K-edge, which shows a decrease in the intensities of the Mo–S and Mo–Mo peaks, followed by Pd doping. The former leads to the formation of new sulphur vacancies, whereas the latter is attributed toward the rearrangement of both atoms due to the generation of sulphur vacancies and fixation of Pd. Fig. 1i represents a dark field-scanning transmission electron microscopy image of 1% Pd–MoS2 containing distinct lattice structures, i.e., hexagonal lattice structure of 2H-MoS2 and trigonal lattice area of the 1T phase of MoS2, indicating the successful formation of the 1T phase. In comparison to other heteroatom-doped MoS2 material, the as-prepared sample, i.e., Pd–MoS2, gives the highest HER output in an acidic solution and exhibits good cycling stability and unique anti-leaching property.


2.1.2 Non-metal doping. 
Peto et al.,61 in their work reported the basal plane activation of single-layered MoS2 by the spontaneous incorporation of oxygen atoms into the MoS2 basal plane by ambient exposure. The controlled oxygen substitution on the MoS2 basal plane maintains the original crystal framework of MoS2 along with having an impact on the electronic band structure, allowing the more effective engineering/arrangement of its optical and electronic features. Here, the oxygen substitution reaction occurs slowly where each sulphur atom is replaced by one oxygen atom, leading to the formation of a crystalline 2D molybdenum oxy-sulphide phase (i.e., 2D MoS2−xOx crystals). Single-layered exfoliated MoS2 was prepared through modified exfoliation technique using atomically flat Au(III) as substrates. The exfoliated single-layered MoS2 samples were kept for a prolonged time period of 1.5 years under ambient conditions (i.e., room temperature, air, and ambient light) to study the structural changes that occurred during this time period. It has been observed that after ambient exposure of the sample for 1 month, it exhibits the origin of new point defects over the entire basal plane. Similarly, after 1 year of ambient exposure, there occurs a striking increase in the concentration of the defects all over the basal plane. The magnified resolution of the STM image displays dark triangles and bright spot within the dark triangles. The former characterizes the sulphur vacancies and the latter represents the oxygen-related defects. The PL spectra measurements were conducted for fresh and aged MoS2 samples on Si/SiO2 substrates. The fresh sheets of MoS2 show peaks at about 630 and 680 nm, whereas the aged MoS2 sample, i.e., 2D MoS2−xOx (6 months old) show peaks at about 634, 677, and 710 nm (1.75 eV). The peak at 1.75 eV has been reported to be arising due to the oxygen-filled sulphur vacancies.
Similarly, Liu et al.62 in his experimental work reported that the doping of P can build new active sites on the MoS2 basal plane as well as enlarge the interlayer spacing to promote enhanced activity toward HER. The involvement of P dopants in MoS2 can tune its surface electronic state, enhancing its electrical conductivity and swift electron transfer among the basal plane active sites. MoS2 nanosheets with P dopants are synthesized by taking sodium molybdate dihydrate (Na2MoO4·2H2O), ammonium dihydrogen phosphate (NH4H2PO4), and thioacetamide (CH3CSNH2) as precursors through one-pot chemical reaction. Fig. 2a presents the HRTEM image for the edge area showing the expansion of interlayer spacing as it ranges from 0.65 to 0.91 nm, which is much larger than 0.65 nm of pristine MoS2 nanosheets, as seen in Fig. 2b.

(c) Schematic illustration of the synthetic procedure for PRMoSx@CC (reproduced with permission from ref. 63. Copyright 2017 Wiley-VCH). 
On the other hand, Huang et al.63 designed a facile two-step synthetic strategy to fabricate P-doped 2H-MoS2 film through low-temperature heat treatment using conductive substrates, as depicted in Fig. 2c. The process of P-doping is carried out, followed by O-doping in order to achieve cost-effective techniques and to reduce the inherent difficulty while doping P into the MoS2 crystal as MoP is spontaneously formed, which requires plasma ion implantation such as sophisticated and expensive equipment. MoSx was prepared in the first step by electrochemical deposition over carbon cloth (denoted as MoSx@CC), followed by P-doping into MoSx@CC in the second step under nitrogen atmosphere using NaH2PO2 as a source of P (denoted as PRMoSx@CC). To study the significance of oxygen presence for P-doping, MoSx@CC was reduced in the presence of H2 to pure 2H-MoS2 and was further doped with P using the same source and procedure but in two different surroundings, i.e., N2 and air. But after the reduction of MoSx@CC to 2H-MoS2, the doping of P was difficult due to the absence of oxygen, indicating the need and successful incorporation of P and O into the sample, thereby activating it.


2.1.3 Doping and etching of elements. 
Among the various synthetic methods achieved so far, very few researchers have successfully activated the basal plane by controllably and effectively inducing pores on to the basal planes of MoS2. This provides a porous material, thereby enhancing the HER activity. It has been observed that throughout the doping and etching method, one can successfully activate the basal plane of MoS2 by introducing pores, thus increasing its surface area. In this regard, Geng et al.64 designed Al–MoS2 nanosheets by doping different amounts of aluminium (Fig. 3a–d), followed by the traditional one-step hydrothermal method. Thereafter, nanosheets of porous MoS2 were fabricated using NaOH solution to etch away the aluminium from the as-prepared Al-doped MoS2 for the activation of basal planes. This technique produces porous MoS2 by the removal of aluminium, resulting in the improvement of the electrocatalytic HER. From the TEM analysis, it is concluded that Al-etched MoS2 possesses numerous pores on the basal plane in comparison to Al–MoS2, suggesting the formation of pores by the removal of Al atoms. Due to more doping of Al atoms, followed by the removal of the same using NaOH, results in the formation of bigger pores, which splits the large sized nanosheets into smaller ones, thereby enhancing its activity. The porous nature of Al-etched MoS2 in comparison to pristine–MoS2 is also indicated from the N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms shown in Fig. 3e and f. As per the Brunauer–Emmett method, the specific surface area of MoS2 is 27.19 m2 g−1, which is much larger than that for pristine MoS2, i.e., 7.68 m2 g−1, thereby exhibiting the porosity feature of MoS2, which can show enhanced HER performance.

Copyright 2017 Wiley-VCH). 
Again, Kim and his groups65 designed the atomic layer deposition technique, followed by etching to activate the basal plane of MoS2. Using this technique, titania (TiO2) islands are formed on the surface of MoS2 by continuous coating at different cycles. Afterward, the coated TiO2 are leached out from the surface of MoS2 by the in situ electrochemical activation process, generating highly localized atomic surface distortions on the basal planes of MoS2, denoted as (ALD (Act.)–MoS2), due to the occurrence of chemical and structural variations. With the increase in the surface distortions on the MoS2 basal plane, the HER performance of the material increases. Fig. 3g, h, and 3i shows HRTEM and SEM images along with the EDS spectra for pristine MoS2, ALD (TiO2)–MoS2, and ALD (Act.)–MoS2, respectively. Fig. 3g shows the structure of the basal plane for pristine MoS2, whereas Fig. 3h shows the HRTEM and SEM images, revealing the formation of TiO2 islands on the basal plane of MoS2 during the ALD technique. The EDS spectra displayed in the inset of Fig. 3h indicates the presence of Ti from the sharp red peak. Fig. 3i displays the complete disappearance of TiO2 coatings from the MoS2 basal plane after the electrochemical activation process. The EDS spectra demonstrated in the inset of Fig. 3i also proves the absence of Ti by showing no peaks for Ti. This confirms the generation of surface distortions on the MoS2 basal planes, which are highly localized and show improved HER kinetics.

2.2 Creating vacancies
In addition, the activation of the basal plane is also achieved by the development of new active sites on the basal plane of MoS2 by creating sulphur vacancies. The generation of sulphur vacancies on the MoS2 basal plane intensifies the densities that provides new catalytic active sites, thus improving the HER activity.66

2.2.1 Chemical reduction method. 
Geng et al.67 utilized a simple and general chemical reduction method to develop sulphur vacancies on the basal plane of multilayer 2H-MoS2 nanosheets, bulk, as well as commercial MoS2. He used NaBH4 for the removal of sulphur atoms in the form of hydrogen sulphide (H2S) gas from 2H-MoS2 basal plane, commonly known as the desulfurizing “activation” reduction method. During the NaBH4 reduction of MoS2 nanosheets, the stinking smell of rotten egg arises due to the formation of H2S by withdrawing partial sulphur atoms from the MoS2 nanosheets, suggesting the origin of S-vacancies. The sulphur vacancies-rich MoS2 nanosheets were synthesized at different reaction times using a similar procedure to study the effective time of reduction and this change in reducing the time can easily control the formation of S-vacancies. The XRD graph, as depicted in Fig. 4a, shows no variation between the diffraction peaks of neat MoS2–O and S-vacancies-oriented MoS2 nanosheets and no impurity peaks were observed for MoS2 nanosheets with S-vacancies, indicating the successful generation of sulphur vacancies on the MoS2 basal plane by the above reduction method. Fig. 4b shows the HRTEM image of the MoS2-5 sample, in which the interlayer spacing of 0.27 nm is observed, similar to that of 2H-MoS2 along with some clear distortions and dislocations, specifying the structure of the S-vacancies-rich MoS2 basal plane. The HRTEM image for a curled edge is produced in Fig. 4c, exhibiting a bit larger interplanar spacing than 0.61 nm in 2H-MoS2 and discontinuous crystal fringes are attributed to the presence of rich defects. Similarly, Tsai et al.68 in his work also developed a synthetic route using electrochemical desulfurization to produce sulphur vacancies on the MoS2 basal planes. Throughout the procedure, the sulphur atoms on the basal plane of MoS2 get hydrogenated and leave the basal plane as H2S gas-generating sulphur vacancies. By varying the applied desulfurization voltage, the concentration of the sulphur vacancies on the basal plane can be manipulated.

2.2.2 Thermal annealing method. 
Kiriya et al.69 reported a genuine thermal procedure where the texturization of the basal plane of pristine MoS2 occurs via a simple thermal annealing procedure under hydrogen atmosphere, as illustrated in Fig. 4d. Annealing in a hydrogen environment causes the removal of sulphur atoms in the form of H2S gas from the MoS2 surface, thereby enhancing the surface area and reducing the resistivity of MoS2. Due to the formation of sulphur vacancies, the Mo atoms on the surface of MoS2 forms Mo clusters, leading to the decomposition of MoS2 into the edge sites, thereby making itself an eminent HER catalyst. Fig. 4(e–g) represents the SEM images of different morphologies of pristine MoS2, representing the increase in the density of defects and edge sites with an increase in the annealing temperature. The XRD data in Fig. 4h shows that the bulk of the sample remains the same, whereas the surface sensitive grazing angle XRD data in Fig. 4i displays the existence of Mo on the surface due to an increase in the peak intensity of Mo with increased annealing temperature.


2.2.3 Ion beam irradiation method. 
Among numerous techniques, the control over the density and the defect type can be achieved by ion beam irradiation by getting control over the irradiation parameters such as energy, fluence, and type of incident ions. He et al.70 in his work prepared single-layered MoS2, denoted as SL-MoS2, via chemical vapor deposition (CVD) on the Si/SiO2 substrates using sulphur powders and MoO3 as the precursors, as shown in Fig. 4j. Further, the as-prepared SL–MoS2 was irradiated with 500 keV Au+ ions with different ion fluences varying from 5*1011 to 1*104 ions cm−2. Fig. 4k shows the XPS spectra of the as-grown pristine–MoS2 sample along with the Au+ ion-irradiated sample with a fluence of 1*1013 ions cm−2. As observed from Fig. 4l, the S and Mo ratio was 2 for the pristine MoS2 sample, which reduced to 1.67 for the sample exposed to ion irradiation of 5*103 ions/cm−2, thereby concluding that with the increase in the fluence, the S and Mo ratio decreases. The XPS data specified that the MoS2 sample on ion irradiation readily loses sulphur atoms rather than Mo atoms, thereby creating S-vacancies. These defects generated can tune the interaction between MoS2 and the environment, resulting in remarkable changes in the electrocatalytic activity and light emission features. The PL spectra in Fig. 4m depicts that the PL peak intensity decreases with an increase in the ion fluence and beyond the fluence of 5 × 103 ions cm−2, a negligible peak is observed. This decrease in the PL peak intensity is attributed toward the increased number of defects, generating additional mid-gap defect states in MoS2.71


2.2.4 Plasma treatment. 
Similar to above methods, plasma technique has known to be an effective technology for generating defect active sites into the basal planes of MoS2. Li et al.,72 by employing chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method, synthesized monolayer 2H-MoS2, followed by the straining of the 2H-MoS2 film by a patterned gold nanocone substrate. Further, the basal plane of 2H-MoS2 was revealed by mild argon plasma, resulting in the generation of sulphur vacancies and activating the basal plane, which is confirmed from characterization such as ACTEM (aberration corrected transmission electron microscope). By varying the argon plasma exposure time, the generation of sulphur vacancies on the basal plane can be controlled. But due to the bombardment of strong Ar, the bonding structures of MoS2 frequently gets damaged, resulting in the formation of smaller fragments of MoS2, thereby disturbing its structural framework. Therefore, later on, Ye et al.73 also used chemical vapor deposition (CVD) to synthesize monolayers of pristine MoS2, which was further exposed to oxygen plasma and hydrogen treatment at high temperature to produce triangular holes and cracks, which enhanced its HER activity. The intrinsic structural defect in the MoS2 monolayer fabricated through CVD leads to opportunities for tuning the features of MoS2 by engineering the defects ahead. Fig. 5(a–d) represents the morphologies of the oxygen plasma-exposed CVD-grown MoS2 monolayers for 0 s, 10 s, 20 s, and 30 s, respectively. From the images, isolated and short cracks were noticed on the basal plane of MoS2, which further elongates and breaks down into smaller fragments having extra exposed edges with increased exposure time. Fig. 5e represents the Raman spectra for the freshly grown MoS2 monolayers by CVD along with MoS2 toward plasma exposure for 10 s and 20 s. The position of the peak for the A1g mode blue shifts from 383.57 cm−1 to 380.14 cm−1, whereas the same for E12g mode red shifts from 405.85 cm−1 to 409.26 cm−1, confirming the lattice deformation due to oxygen plasma.

Similar to the above procedure of oxygen plasma exposure, Cheng et al.74 reported an effective and simple approach to create basal plane reactive sulphur vacancies on monolayer crystalline MoS2 by the use of hydrogen plasma process and the experimental setup is represented in Fig. 5f. This process not only increases the number of S-vacancies but also maintains the structure and morphology, thereby enhancing the HER activity of the MoS2 monolayer flakes. In contrast to the argon and oxygen plasma procedure, the stoichiometry of monolayered MoS2 treated with hydrogen plasma can be modified. In addition to it, the geometrical shape and structure of monolayered MoS2, followed by H2-plasma treatment, were well-preserved. Raman spectroscopy, as displayed in Fig. 5g, shows two characteristic peaks for H2-plasma-treated MoS2. By increasing the time of plasma treatment from 5 to 10 and 15 min, the position of the E12g peak is red shifted to 385, 373, and 372 cm−1, whereas the peak position for A1g is blue shifted to 406, 407, and 410 cm−1, respectively, indicating the existence of defects on the MoS2 monolayers. From the XPS data given in Fig. 5h, characteristic peaks at 232.5 eV and 229.4 eV are observed for Mo 3d3/2 and Mo 3d5/2 and the peaks at 1636.2 eV and 162.0 eV for S 2p1/2 and S 2p3/2, respectively, from Fig. 5i. A significant decrease in the intensity of S2− 2p after exposure to H2 plasma is observed with clarity, suggesting the successful removal of sulphur atoms from MoS2 monolayers, creating S-vacancies.
Apart from all these strategies, Yin et al.75 utilized liquid ammonia assisted lithiation (LAAL) method to fabricate novel mesoporous 1T-MoS2 nanosheets (P-1T MoS2) with numerous edge sites and dense sulphur vacancies, leading the material toward HER in a holistic way. These mesoporous 1T-MoS2 nanosheets (P-1T MoS2) were formed due to extreme desulfurization reaction between MoS2 and lithium.

2.3 Phosphidation
Kim and co-workers76 demonstrated that the basal plane of MoS2 can also be activated by allowing Ni2P nanoparticles to grow on them, resulting in the formation of the Ni2P/MoS2 heterostructure through in situ phosphidation, as represented in Fig. 6a. The basal plane of MoS2 forms a widely cross-doped and interconnected heterostructure with Ni2P particles. Further, the Ni2P/MoS2 heterostructure is hybridized with the conductive carbon substrate such as N-doped carbon nanotube or N-doped graphene, giving rise to Ni2P/MoS2/N:CNT or Ni2P/MoS2/N:RGO, thereby improving the HER performance. The Ni2P/MoS2 heterostructure was prepared from NiMoS4, a single precursor to enhance the strength of interaction between the MoS2 and Ni2P phases. Fig. 6b depicts the XRD of the Ni2P/MoS2/N:CNT hybrid catalyst, which verifies the presence of both the phases, i.e., hexagonal Ni2P and MoS2. An expanded interlayer distance of 0.68 nm is observed for the (002) peak of MoS2 in comparison to the standard spacing of 0.615 nm, indicating the entry of P or Ni atoms between two layers of MoS2.

3 Hydrogen evolution reaction over basal plane-activated MoS2
MoS2 has long been utilized as the most attracted HER catalyst due to its lower cost, excellent stability, and earth abundant properties.14,77 Norskov et al. theoretically predicted that the metallic edges of MoS2 possess ΔGH* = 0.06 eV, for which 2D-MoS2 has been demonstrated as a promising low-cost HER catalyst and due to such lower Gibbs free energy value, the H atoms can be easily adsorbed on the surface of MoS2.78,79 MoS2 consists of both edge as well basal planes for the catalytic reaction. The excellent catalytic activity of MoS2 is well accepted from both the Mo edges (1 0 0) and S edges ( 010), which are known to be the two most active edge sites responsible for HER.12 However the basal plane is less active toward HER due to its less conducting properties followed by low charge transfer kinetics across the plane.49 However, activating the basal plane using various techniques has achieved excellent HER performance. Therefore, this review has focused on the enhancement of the HER performance via the basal plane activation of MoS2.
However, the first basal plane activation of MoS2 has been demonstrated by Li et al.72 by creating S-vacancies, followed by strain for superior HER performance. The DFT studies suggested that the strained S-vacancies provides new active sites to the MoS2 basal plane, in which around the Fermi level, the gap states are introduced, which permits the hydrogen ion to adsorb and bind with the Mo atoms on the surface of MoS2 directly. In addition, the corresponding Kohn–Sham orbitals, which are present below the Fermi level illustrated that these gap states are formed due to the strained S-vacancies and are visualized around the S-vacancy. It has been seen that both the strain as well as S-vacancies on the surface of MoS2 together improved the HER activity of MoS2 with an optimal ΔGH* = 0 eV. From the literature study, it has been deduced that the ΔGH* value of ∼2 eV makes the basal plane of 2H-MoS2 very inert toward the HER performance. However, the ΔGH* value decreases with the increase in the number of S-vacancies on the surface of the basal plane, which extends the H-adsorptions sites. This ΔGH* value further moves toward zero by the introduction of elastic strain to the S-vacancy, thus shifting the gap states closer to the Fermi level. The study deduced that a multiple optimal combination of strain and S-vacancies is required in order to satisfy an optimal ∼ΔGH* = 0 eV and from the experimental investigation, it has been seen that smaller S-vacancy with greater strain and vice versa satisfy the above condition. In the current study, 3.12% and 12.5% S-vacancy with 8% and 1% strain has been proved to be the most optimal condition to tune the activity of HER in the basal plane of MoS2. Experimentally, 3.12% S-vacancies stabilizes hydrogen on the exposed Mo atoms with decreasing ΔGH* value to 0.18 eV and with 9–19% S-vacancy, ΔGH* lies between ±0.08 eV, which is similar to the hydrogen adsorption value obtained in the edge site MoS2. In addition, the stability is deduced from the study of the surface energy per unit cell, which suggested that the high concentration of the S-vacancy (beyond 11%) along with high strain increases ΔGH*, thus indicating a decline in the stability of the surface. The increase in the HER performance is investigated from the corresponding Tafel plots as the Tafel slope decreases from 98 mV dec−1 to 60 mV dec−1 when both the strain and S-vacancy were introduced into the MoS2 basal plane.
On the other hand, Cheng and his co-workers74 designed monolayer crystalline 2D-MoS2 with a high amount of S-vacancy to enhance the HER performance via basal plane activation. The process induces optimum active sites by tuning the stoichiometry of the S-vacancy, thus lowering the overpotential value and Tafel slope along with an enhancement in the exchange current density and EDLC. The approach is highly desirable toward the creation as well as the tuning of the defect density on various 2D-materials.
Besides vacancy creation, basal plane activation via chemical doping with a proper choice of dopants has been proven to be an effective way to speed up the slow HER kinetics, followed by multiple reaction mechanisms in the electrochemical cells. Chemical doping including both metal as well as non-metal atom enhances the HER properties by modulating the active sites along with the intrinsic conductivity upon the basal surface of MoS2. Liu et al.62 in one of his works used P as a dopant in order to create new basal plane active sites in MoS2 nanosheets for superior HER performance. The introduction of P to the basal surface of MoS2 enlarges the interlayer spacing of MoS2, followed by increasing the density of the exposed active sites and such kind of results modify the electronic structure of MoS2, which has a great effect on the optimization of ΔGH*. Simply, P dopant in the MoS2 matrix shows dual functional characteristics for both providing new active sites and enhancing its electrical conductivity. As illustrated in the free energy diagram (Fig. 7a), the P dopants modulated the surface electronic states of MoS2, which enhances the electron transfer between the basal planes of MoS2. In addition, it also acts as new active sites with ΔGH* = 0.04 eV and also facilitates the reduction of the ΔGH* value of neighboring S atoms (0.43 eV), which is higher than that in neat MoS2 (2.2 eV). Fig. 7b displayed that after the introduction of P, the interlayer spacing of MoS2 is expanded to 0.91 nm along with a smaller ΔGH* value of −0.09 eV, which facilitates the proton adsorption process along with faster hydrogen desorption kinetics. From the experimental results, as given in Fig. 7c, the as-fabricated P-doped MoS2 with an optimal amount of P showed a current density of 10 mA cm−2 at a small onset potential of 15 mV, as compared to pristine MoS2 (88 mV). In addition, the P-doped MoS2 exhibited extremely low overpotential value of 43 mV along with a Tafel slope value of 34 mV dec−1 (Fig. 7d).

Similarly, Wang et al.80 introduced F and N to MoS2 for activating its basal plane for enormously enhancing its HER performance. First principles calculations revealed that N on the co-doped NF-MoS2 synergistically affects the HER properties of MoS2 by providing high density of new active sites and the N atoms has been activated by the influence of F doping on the basal plane of NF-MoS2. The two kinds of active sites showing N and F in NF-MoS2 for HER performance has been represented in Fig. 7e. From the DFT calculation, as depicted in Fig. 7f, the N active sites on the NF-MoS2 basal plane possess an optimum ΔGH* value of −0.145 eV, which is much smaller than that of pristine MoS2 and N-doped MoS2, suggesting fast electron/proton adsorption, followed by the fast release of H over the N site on the basal plane. Owing to the different electronegativity of N and F, the optimized charge distribution analysis (Fig. 7g and h) indicated that F atom is responsible for the activation of N sites on the basal plane of NF-MoS2, which further suggested that the basal plane of NF-MoS2 is catalytically activated by the induction of a synergistic effect of F and N co-doping. The as-prepared N and F co-doped MoS2 showed an enhancement in the HER activity with a low onset overpotential (110 mV) as well as a small Tafel slope (57 mV dec−1). In addition, the optimized catalyst exhibited long term durability for HER in an acidic environment as after continuous operation over 30000 s, the current density was slightly degraded.
It has been predicted that the doping of transition metal to the neighboring S atoms facilitates the activation of the S atoms on the surface of the basal plane. In particular, the activation process proceeds via the conversion of fully occupied valence shell to the partially open local S atoms in order to facilitate the hydrogen adsorption process, thus enhancing the HER activity. Such kind of activity results in the transfer of e− from S atoms to the neighboring new metal center. In this regard, Liu et al.81 proposed a physical model by taking transition metals of the 3d series in order to demonstrate as well as understand the activation of S-atoms on the surface of the MoS2 basal plane. The study reveals that these S-atoms provide the most active sites for H-binding, in which the dopants replace the Mo atoms connected to the same S. When the S atoms with fully occupied valence shells interact with H atoms; then, electron transfer takes place to the Fermi level, which lower the energy through the occupation of the antibonding orbital, resulting in effective S–H interaction (Table 2).

The literature study explored that phase transformation from the semiconducting to the metallic phase of MoS2 through alkali metal intercalation is also a part toward the activation of MoS2. However, due to the weak bonding between MoS2 than that with alkali metal makes 1T-MoS2 very unstable by reverting its phase to 2H, thus reducing its HER performance. However, doping MoS2 with a suitable metal bearing a different number of valence electrons than Mo and similar radius as Mo can stabilize the distorted 1T-MoS2 by enhancing the HER activity over the basal plane of MoS2. In this regard, Yang and his co-workers53 demonstrated that when rhenium (Re) is alloyed on to the surface of inert basal planes of 2D-MoS2, its HER activity is enhanced to a great extent. The combination of theory with experiment suggested that the introduction of only 50% level of Re converts the pure 2H-MoS2 phase to the stable distorted tetragonal structure (1T-MoS2), which is responsible for the activation of the basal plane of MoS2. The basal plane activation of MoS2 proceeding through the alloy with Re exhibited superior HER performance than that with the alkali metal intercalation method as the former case provides the most stable distorted tetragonal phase with better basal plane catalytic activity. From the experiment, it is noteworthy that the HER activity of (Re, Mo)S2 with ∼50% Re and ∼50% Mo has been found to be superior than other concentration of Mo and Re. The electrochemical measurement (Fig. 7i–k) illustrated that the as-fabricated alloy catalyst, i.e., Re0.55Mo0·45S2 with highly stable distorted tetragonal phase exhibited a low onset potential (90 mV) and a small Tafel slope (56 mV dec−1) along with very low hydrogen adsorption energy of 0.06 eV. In addition, the TOF value is found to be 3.4 and 0.015 S−1 for Re0.55Mo0·45S2 at 300 and 0 mV overpotential, which are superior than the edge/defect-engineered MoS2 samples.
Another technique toward the enhancement of the HER performance of MoS2, followed by basal plane activation is a powerful combination of S-vacancy with transition metal doping. It has been seen that the activation rate of the basal plane of MoS2 substantially increases, in which the transition metal atom with an optimal concentration is doped in the S-vacancy sites. In some cases, it has been demonstrated that the presence of a small amount of S-vacancies on the MoS2 surface tends to agglomerate and leads to the creation of larger S-vacancies since it is not thermodynamically stable. This excess concentration of S-vacancies causes the strong adsorption of the HER intermediate, i.e., H* on the basal plane of MoS2, making it a poison, thus lowering the HER performance. In this respect, by combining DFT calculations and experiments, Park and his co-authors82 introduced Co-clusters to the basal plane of desulfurized MoS2 (MoS2−x) in order to enhance the HER activity. Throughout the study, it has been observed that significant improvement in the HER performance is achieved per unit active sites when the Co clusters are directly exposed to the S-vacancies sites by forming the Co–Mo interface, thus enhancing the activity of the basal plane, followed by the increasing electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) with the preferred active sites. It has been seen that the addition of Co clusters to the desulfurized multilayer MoS2−x reduces the overpotential from −0.32 V to −0.21 V at −10 mA cm−2.

Fig. 8a depicts the adsorption of intermediate hydrogen over monolayer desulfurized MoS2−x with various amounts of Co clusters (0, 1, 3, 4, and 6) and from the series of structural models, we can estimate both the limiting potential (UL) as well as ΔGH*. The DFT calculations obtained from the previously reported study suggested that the UL of pristine MoS2 for the HER process is 1.9 V as it binds and adsorbs H* very weakly. As shown in Fig. 8b, the creation of the S vacancy with respect to the activation of the basal plane of MoS2 strengthens the interaction of H* on the surface of MoS2, thus decreasing the UL up to 0.10 V. However, there is a further increase of UL as the concentration of the S-vacancy increases and the UL value increases from 0.10 V to 0.54 V as the concentration of S-vacancy increases from 3.1% to 18.8%. However, the addition of Co cluster to the S vacancy again lowers the UL along with free adsorption energy. As shown in Fig. 8b and the free energy diagram obtained from Fig. 8c, Con/MoS2−x with n = 1 exhibited lower UL = 0.01 V with the ΔGH* value nearly zero.

4 Conclusion and outlook
Over the past few years, MoS2 as a trending 2D-material has achieved fast growing interest in its application toward the catalytic activity owing to its exceptional and unique features. From various literature studies, it has been concluded that, in comparison to semiconducting 2H-MoS2, the 1T metallic phase of MoS2 presents a far better catalytic activity but due to thermal instability, it can be easily reversed back to 2H-MoS2, exhibiting lower activity. Therefore, the activation of chemically inert basal plane of 2H-MoS2 is of great practical significance toward an improved electrocatalytic HER performance. Hence, in this review, several latest synthetic strategies employed for the introduction of catalytically active sites on the basal plane of MoS2 are summarized systematically. By inducing pores via doping and etching, and generating sulphur vacancies on the inert basal plane of MoS2, it can be activated. The formation of pores makes the material porous, possessing higher HER activity. Different technologies such as ion beam irradiation, plasma techniques, and chemical reduction method are operated for the emergence of sulphur vacancies on MoS2 basal planes. Various other methods such as the doping of transition metals and non-metals along with high heat annealing method are also used for the activation of MoS2 basal planes. Finally, an elaborate discussion is focused on the electrocatalytic HER activity of basal plane-activated MoS2. The development of fresh new catalytically active sites on the basal plane, in addition to catalytically active edge sites of MoS2, reveals enhanced electrocatalytic HER activity.
Further, to upgrade the catalytic properties and activities of MoS2 to the level of commercialization, attempts should be made on some following key points.
(1) Depending upon the study about the development of catalytic active sites on the basal planes of MoS2, further explorations must be continued to search for new and easier methodologies to get control over the formation of defects as excess of pores or vacancies on the basal plane of MoS2 can lead to a distorted MoS2 framework.
(2) It is necessary to search for more advanced techniques for the fabrication and stabilization of highly pure metallic 1T phase of MoS2 as well as for improving its properties.
(3) Further research and efforts must be pursued toward the successful development of simpler and easier technologies for the activation of MoS2 basal planes in an economic and eco-friendly manner.
(4) Since, very few literature have been reported regarding the application of basal plane activated MoS2, i.e., electrocatalytic HER only, future researches ought to explore and expand its wide range of applications in various other fields.
Despite all these troublesome issues, MoS2 has evolved and proved itself to be a promising and competing semiconductor material in the race of other 2D semiconductor materials on account of its extraordinary physical and chemical characteristics.
