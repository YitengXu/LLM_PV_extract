    , Accepted 8th July 2019First published on 9th July 2019AbstractAn all-inorganic CsPbI2Br perovskite with excellent phase stability and thermal stability has been considered to be a promising candidate for photovoltaic application. However, low efficiency and high moisture sensitivity hinder its advancement. In this work, we exploit 4-bromobenzylamine hydriodate post-treatment on CsPbI2Br thin films to assist the extraction of holes and to block the flow of electrons to the hole transport layer through band engineering at the CsPbI2Br bulk/surface. We found through depth profile analysis that a small amount of BrBeAI permeates into the CsPbI2Br bulk and mainly locates at the CsPbI2Br grain boundaries. This treatment leads to an improved short-circuit current of CsPbI2Br solar cells and an enhanced efficiency from 13.10% to 14.63%. In addition, the incorporation of the hydrophobic organic component into perovskite films effectively enhances the moisture resistance. This result proves that utilizing organic ammonium salt to improve the performance of the device through band alignment is an effective strategy for all-inorganic perovskite solar cell optimization.
1. Introduction
Over the past few years, organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have suddenly emerged and become a superstar in the field of photovoltaics, attracting great attention from the scientific research community.1–9 This achievement is primarily due to the surge in power conversion efficiency (PCE) (from 3.9% to over 23% within 10 years).10–12 However, the fact that these materials are quite vulnerable to humidity and heat substantially hampers their future commercialization.13–15 To solve this problem, cesium-based all-inorganic perovskites have recently attracted increasing attentions as a result of better light and especially thermal stability, providing a new possibility for fabricating intrinsically more stable PSCs.16–24
For cesium-based all-inorganic perovskite materials, CsPbI3 is theoretically the best alternative for photovoltaic application because of its narrowest band gap (Eg = 1.73 eV). Unfortunately, the cubic (α) CsPbI3 perovskite phase is stable only at high temperature, and rapid conversion to the non-perovskite orthorhombic (δ) phase (Eg = 2.82 eV) at room temperature (RT) degrades the device performance significantly.25–27 In contrast, the single Br-substituted CsPbI2Br perovskite shows good α phase stability at RT, which is attributed to the lowered phase transition temperature and increased effective tolerance factor.28 This material has a moderate band gap (1.82–1.92 eV) depending on the preparation process, corresponding to an absorption edge of 681–646 nm, which is suitable to serve as a sunlight absorber. However, CsPbI2Br undergoes transformation into a non-perovskite orthorhombic phase in moisture and exhibits much lower device PCE in comparison with their organic–inorganic hybrid counterparts.29,30 How to improve the device humidity stability as well as the photovoltaic performance remains a big challenge for further advance of CsPbI2Br PSCs.
In PSC fabrication, interface engineering is a widely used and effective strategy to improve the device performance, including both the efficiency and the stability.31–37 For example, Zhao et al. exploited phenylethylammonium iodine to form a defect-passivating PEA+ terminated surface, which can improve the phase stability as well as moisture resistance of CsPbI3.38 Yan et al. employed 4-fluoroaniline as a modifier to passivate the surface/interface, yielding a hydrophobic protection layer to improve the stability together with photovoltaic performance.39 In another work, phenyltrimethylammonium bromide was used to dope the CsPbI3 perovskite and passivate surface, this bifunctional stabilization of the perovskite leads to a device with high PCE (17.06%) and good stability.40 The Liu group introduced phenylethylammonium chlorine to engineer the CsPbI2Br surface, and it was found that hydrophobic PEA+ adopts an edge-on orientation on the perovskite surface to prevent moisture penetration.41 For all these reports, passivation of the surface is considered to be the dominant effect of the capping layers. These results indicate that organic bulky amines have a significant effect on perovskite interface modification.
In this work, we introduce 4-bromobenzylamine hydriodate (BrBeAI, its chemical structure is shown in Fig. S1†) to modify the perovskite surface and to improve the device performance. It was found that BrBeAI forms a hydrophobic capping layer on the top of CsPbI2Br thin film surfaces with iodide being incorporated into the CsPbI2Br lattice. In addition, through depth profile analysis we found that a small amount of BrBeAI permeates into CsPbI2Br bulk and mainly locates at the CsPbI2Br grain boundaries. Current density–voltage (J–V) characterization shows that CsPbI2Br PSCs with BrBeAI treatment deliver a much-improved PCE from 13.10% to 14.63%. Further studies reveal that unlike the previously reported passivation effect of organic amines, here the band alignment caused by organic ammonium salt treatment at CsPbI2Br bulk/surface promotes the charge extraction and collection, which contributes to the enhanced Jsc and Voc values. In addition, the organic capping layer effectively prevents the penetration of moisture, thereby greatly improving the humidity stability of the CsPbI2Br perovskite.
2. Results and discussion
We prepared 0.8 M CsBr solution together with equal stoichiometric PbI2 in mixed solvents of DMF and DMSO as the perovskite precursor solution. Through a one-step spin coating method, an ∼400 nm thin film (measured using a profilometer) was obtained after being annealed at 200 °C. BrBeAI was selected as the hydrophobic organic capping layer to improve the moisture stability of the perovskite. BrBeAI isopropanol solutions with different concentrations (1, 2 and 4 mg mL−1) were spin coated onto the CsPbI2Br surface, and then the films were annealed at 100 °C for 5 min. Here, we mark these films as BrBeAI-1, BrBeAI-2 and BrBeAI-4, respectively. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out to investigate the thermal stability of BrBeAI. Fig. S1† shows that BrBeAI begins to disintegrate once the temperature reaches 105 °C.
Top-view scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was exploited to characterize the surface morphologies of the CsPbI2Br films treated with BrBeAI (marked as BrBeAI-CsPbI2Br). As shown in Fig. 1a, the pristine CsPbI2Br thin film is compact and pinhole-free with a grain size of 200–600 nm. Through post-treatment using different concentrations of BrBeAI isopropanol solution, the perovskite surface morphologies exhibit a great discrepancy. Obviously, numerous bright particles appear on the film surface when the concentration of BrBeAI solution is 1 mg mL−1, which may be the residual organic ammonium salt. With increasing the amount of ammonium salt in isopropanol, it can be found that the size of the particles is enlarged, indicating that more residual BrBeAI is dispersed on the surface. In order to further study the microstructures of the films, top-view atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurement was carried out. As can be seen in Fig. S2,† the root-mean-square (RMS) roughness increases from 9.14 nm to 11.40 nm after BrBeAI-2 treatment, which may be attributed to the stacking of organic residues on the CsPbI2Br thin films. This result is in agreement with the SEM observation. In addition, Fig. S2† shows that residual BrBeAI mainly locates at the grain boundaries.
 Fig. 1  Morphologies and structure characteristics of CsPbI2Br thin films treated with different BrBeAI contents: (a) top-surface SEM images, (b) SIMS profiles showing the C7H6+ group from the top to the bottom of the perovskite, (c) XRD patterns, (d) magnification of the portion of the XRD patterns and (e) XRD patterns of BrBeAI-2 films with different annealing time. 
In order to further study the vertical distribution of BrBeA+ in the perovskite films, time-of-flight secondary-ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) was used to characterize the depth profile of BrBeA+ in perovskite layers. Because the N+ signal is very weak in mass spectroscopy, we used C7H6+ instead to study the depth distribution of BrBeA+ in CsPbI2Br film (Fig. 1b). In a positive mass detection mode, the C7H6+ depth profile of BrBeAI-2 film shows a gradually decreasing trend rather than a sharp decline in Fig. 1b. If the BrBeA+ is distributed only on the film surface, an abrupt decline in the TOF-SIMS intensity would be observed due to the sudden composition change. Therefore, a gradual decrease in the TOF-SIMS intensity indicates that BrBeA+ permeates into CsPbI2Br grain boundaries or/and bulk with a gradient distribution near the interface.42 After we washed BrBeAI-2 with isopropanol, we found that the C7H6+ depth profile of washed BrBeAI-2 film exhibited the same trend as that of weaker intensity. Fig. S3a and b† shows the SEM images of the surfaces of BrBeAI-2 film before and after IPA washing, and it reveals that the bright BrBeAI particles disappear after washing. In addition, there is no sign of N 1s observed in XPS (Fig. S3c†) after washing. These observations suggest that almost no BrBeAI disperses on the washed CsPbI2Br film surface. Due to the very limited detection depth of XPS, we believe that the weaker C7H6+ signal of washed BrBeAI-2 is attributed to the permeated BrBeA+. Given the much larger size of BrBeA+ in comparison with that of Cs+, it is very hard to enter the CsPbI2Br crystal lattice. So, we infer that the permeated BrBeA+ should locate at the grain boundaries.
X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed to investigate the film crystallinity and phase purity of the BrBeAI–CsPbI2Br thin films (Fig. 1c). It is obvious that all the films show two dominant sharp diffraction peaks at 14.8° and 29.7°, which can be assigned to the characteristic (100) and (200) planes of the cubic CsPbI2Br perovskite,43 indicating the good crystallinity of the films. The intensity of the XRD peaks and the full width at half-maximum (FWHM) of BrBeAI-treated films exhibit negligible difference from the pristine film without treatment, suggesting that BrBeAI post-treatment has little influence on the overall crystallinity and phase purity of CsPbI2Br thin films.44 It should be noted that no new peaks are observed when we increase the salt concentration, suggesting that the two dimensional (2D) perovskite is not formed through cation exchange.45 This observation confirms that BrBeA+ has not entered the CsPbI2Br crystal to form the 2D perovskite. Fig. 1d shows the enlarged region of the (200) plane, and it is can be seen that with increasing the content of BrBeAI, the peak of BrBeAI–CsPbI2Br films slightly shifts to a lower angle compared to that of the pristine CsPbI2Br film, indicating that the lattice constant is increased.46 Owing to the analogous chemical nature between the I− anion and the Br− anion, it is suggested that the slightly enlarged lattice constant is induced by the substitution of Br− by I−, which can easily occur during the post-annealing process.47 The XRD patterns of BrBeAI-2 thin film with different post-annealing times are shown in Fig. 1e to further investigate the effect of BrBeAI on the CsPbI2Br lattice. As we can see that BrBeAI-2 thin film without post-annealing treatment shows the almost same peak position as that of the pristine CsPbI2Br thin film. This peak shifts to lower 2θ with continually increasing the annealing time, and the peak does not shift any more until the annealing time reaches up to 5 min. This result suggests that post-annealing treatment can assist I− anions in incorporating into CsPbI2Br lattice sites by partly replacing Br− anions, which is consistent with the above results.
Optical absorption measurements were carried out on BrBeAI–CsPbI2Br thin films by UV-vis spectroscopy. As shown in Fig. 2a, the absorbance edges of all films are located at nearly 666 nm (1.86 eV), which is consistent with the reported band gap of CsPbI2Br. After 4-BrBeAI treatment, the absorbance redshift of BrBeAI–CsPbI2Br is less than 2 nm. The negligible difference among the curves indicates that BrBeAI treatments do not affect the absorption of the films and the band gap of the active layers. The slightly enlarged lattice constant and the trifling red shift in UV–vis spectra suggest that only a fraction of Br− anions were exchanged by I− during post-treatment. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy patterns are shown in Fig. S4,† and the aromatic C–H stretching at 3053 cm−1 and aromatic C–C stretching at 1492 cm−1 appear after BrBeAI treatment, proving that organic capping layer has been deposited on the perovskite surface. To further study whether BrBeAI has reacted with the perovskite or are just physically adsorbed onto the film surfaces, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurement was carried out. It can be seen in Fig. S5† that despite the reduced overall intensity, the intensity of the peaks of C 1s and N 1s increases with the BrBeAI content (Fig. 2b and c). Considering the same procedure of sample preparation, the increased peak intensity indicates the enlarged content of BrBeAI on the film surfaces, which is in agreement with our SEM observation. Meanwhile, the binding energies of Cs 3d and Pb 4f exhibit negligible difference after BrBeAI treatment (Fig. S6a and b†), indicating that unlike the inorganic–organic perovskite, there is no 2D perovskite formed by cation exchange between Cs+ and BrBeA+.48 BrBeAI treatment results only in the partial replacement of Br− by I− in the crystal lattice, and this minor substitution does not change the binding energies of cesium and lead cations.49 These results show that the CsPbI2Br crystal has a robust structure with high resistance to the formation of the 2D perovskite.

UPS of pristine and BrBeAI-2 perovskite thin films: (e) cut-off spectra and (f) the valence band maximum (VBM) spectra. 
The photoluminescence (PL) measurement was carried out to study the charge transfer process at the BrBeAI–CsPbI2Br/spiro-OMeTAD interface. PL was performed from the top of the perovskite samples. As shown in Fig. 2d, the suppressed PL intensity of perovskite films after BrBeAI treatment indicates that BrBeAI can promote charge extraction.42 The weak redshift of the PL peak is less than 2 nm, which is consistent with the absorption results, further indicating that halogen ion exchange is very rare. In order to explore whether BrBeAI can passivate the perovskite surface, we measured the PL of BrBeAI–CsPbI2Br thin films without spiro-OMeTAD. Fig. S7† shows that all films have almost the same PL intensity. Time-resolved PL decay profiles of the BrBeAI–CsPbI2Br thin films are shown in Fig. S8,† a similar PL lifetime of all films suggests that BrBeAI hardly reduces the perovskite surface defects, which is consistent with the above PL results.
To explore the effects of BrBeAI on the work function and energy levels of the perovskite, ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) was performed. As shown in Fig. 2e, the Ecutoff values of CsPbI2Br and BrBeAI-2 are 17.20 eV and 16.90 eV, respectively. According to Wf = hν − Ecutoff, here, hν = 21.22 eV, the work function of CsPbI2Br and BrBeAI-2 can be calculated to be 4.02 eV and 4.32 eV, respectively. Fig. 2f shows the valence band maximum (VBM) spectra, the VBM of CsPbI2Br and BrBeAI-2 are 1.64 eV and 1.23 eV, respectively. Therefore, the valence band (Ev) can be calculated to be 5.66 eV and 5.55 eV based on Ev = Wf + VBM. These results reveal that BrBeAI treatment changes the energy levels at CsPbI2Br surface. After we washed BrBeAI-2 with isopropanol, all the energy level changes of the films disappeared. Fig. S3d† shows that the washed BrBeAI-2c retains the same XRD peak position with BrBeAI-2, indicating that IPA washing has not broken the lattice structure of the BrBeAI-2 perovskite. The above results demonstrate that the alterations of the film energy level are induced by BrBeAI itself rather than slight halogen ion exchanges in the crystal.
On the basis of changed Wf, Ev and the almost unchanged band gap, the schematic diagrams (Fig. 3) depict the band alignment in SnO2/CsPbI2Br (left) and SnO2/BrBeAI-2 bulk/surface (right). The band alignment shows that the CsPbI2Br surface treated with BrBeAI serves as a hole-extraction/electron-blocking layer between the CsPbI2Br bulk and the hole transport layer (HTL)/anode. It is suggested that the band alignment at CsPbI2Br bulk/surface provides some contributions to the Jsc and Voc values. For the control devices, electrons flowing from the perovskite to the hole transport layer leads to some photocurrent losses. For the devices with BrBeAI treatment, a valence band offset appears between the CsPbI2Br bulk and surface, and this additional force benefits the flow of holes from the perovskite to the anode.50 In contrast, the energy barrier of the conduction band blocks the electrons from flowing to the CsPbI2Br/HTL interface, therefore suppressing the photocurrent loss.42,51,52 These two factors result in an enhancement in the carrier collection efficiency as well as in the device performance in comparison with control devices.

The planar PSCs were fabricated with the configuration of ITO/SnO2/perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD/Au. Fig. 4a shows the cross-sectional SEM image of the device. Because BrBeAI-2-based devices present the optimal photovoltaic performance, hereafter the characterization studies of the samples are based on devices with 2 mg mL−1 BrBeAI treatment. The J–V curves of the champion devices based on CsPbI2Br and BrBeAI-2 perovskites are shown in Fig. 4b. In a reverse scan mode (all the photovoltaic parameters in this work are obtained from a reverse scan mode), the CsPbI2Br PSC exhibits a moderate efficiency of 13.10%, with a Jsc value of 14.60 mA cm−2, Voc of 1.21 V, and FF of 0.741. The BrBeAI-2-based PSC exhibits a largely improved PCE of 14.63%, with a Jsc value of 15.33 mA cm−2, Voc of 1.25 V, and FF of 0.763. Apparently, BrBeAI post-treatment significantly improves the photovoltaic performance of PSCs, particularly the Jsc and Voc values. This result is in agreement with the above UPS and PL discussions, which concludes that BrBeAI post-treatment contributes to charge extraction and collection. External quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements were carried out to verify the accuracy of the Jsc value obtained from the J–V curves. As shown in Fig. 4c, the BrBeAI-2-based PSC exhibits improved EQE and integrated Jsc values over those of the CsPbI2Br PSC. This result explicitly suggests superior photocurrent collection efficiency of the treated device. In particular, we observe that the main improvement lies in the short wavelength region. Given the very high EQE of the control device at the long wavelength region, it is very hard to be further enhanced and the enhancement will not be obvious. Therefore, it is expected that the improvement in the short wavelength region is more evident. The integrated Jsc value of the BrBeAI-2-based PSC is about 15.12 mA cm−2, which is very close to the Jsc value obtained from the J–V curve (15.33 mA cm−2). Histograms of efficiency statistics for 40 devices are shown in Fig. 4d, and we can see that BrBeAI-2-based PSCs show higher reproducibility and more concentrated efficiency distribution compared to the control devices. Fig. 4e shows the Nyquist plot of the impedance spectroscopy (IS) measured in the dark with an applied voltage of −1.0 V. The recombination resistance (Rrec) of the devices is extracted from the diameter of the semicircle in the Nyquist plots, which is concerned with the loss of carriers caused by recombination of charges and the current leakage in the devices.53,54 As we can see that the BrBeAI-2-based PSC has a much larger Rrec (3620 Ω) compared to the control device (1250 Ω), which suggests that BrBeAI treatment effectively reduces the recombination of charges in the PSCs. This result is in accordance with the device photovoltaic performance.

Organic components often serve as hydrophobic materials to improve the humidity stability of the perovskite. Fig. S9† shows the characterization of the water contact angle. We can find that the water contact angle increases from 58.21° to 75.72° after BrBeAI-2 treatment, which is ascribed to the hydrophobic organic capping layer. The enlarged water contact angle indicates that BrBeAI-2 film has stronger resistance to moisture compared to pristine perovskite film, and this layer may result in the improvement of the humidity stability of the perovskite. To check the effect of BrBeAI treatment on the humidity stability of CsPbI2Br films, XRD was performed on the BrBeAI–CsPbI2Br films which were exposed in high-humidity air without any encapsulation. The XRD patterns shown in Fig. 4f demonstrate that pristine perovskite film transforms into an insulating δ phase within 20 min when it was exposed to 60% relative humidity (RH) at room temperature. Nevertheless, BrBeAI-2 thin film still maintains the pure phase without any change in the same condition. Such a phenomenon demonstrates that the organic BrBeA+ capping layer can effectively block the penetration of moisture. In addition, after 30 days of storage in a dark and dry box with 20% RH at RT, the BrBeAI-2-based device maintains 88% of its initial PCE. However, the pristine device maintains 32% of its initial PCE (Fig. S13†).
3. Conclusions
In conclusion, the efficiency and moisture resistance of CsPbI2Br solar cells are improved through BrBeAI-treated band engineering. Unlike the case of the organic–inorganic perovskite with surface treatment, the CsPbI2Br films could not react with ammonium salt to form 2D perovskite layers through cation exchange.38 Compared with the control device, an enhanced PCE from 13.10% to 14.63% is achieved. This improvement is attributed to the alignment of the energy band between CsPbI2Br bulk and surface, which will benefit the charge extraction and collection. The improved stability under high humidity condition is considered to be a result of the hydrophobic organic capping layer, which is distributed on the CsPbI2Br film surface to resist the penetration of water. We believe that our findings have proved that band engineering is an effective strategy to optimize the device efficiency and stabilize the perovskite for photovoltaic application.
4. Experimental
Materials
The SnO2 colloid precursor, 4-bromobenzylamine (BrBeA) and hydroiodic acid aqueous solution were obtained from Alfa Aesar. CsBr, N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. PbI2 and spiro-OMeTAD were purchased from Xian Polymer Light Technology Corp. BrBeAI was synthesized by a reaction of HI and BrBeA in ice-bath, following the chemical expressions: BrBeA + HI → BrBeAI. 57% hydroiodic acid aqueous solution was added dropwise slowly into the stirred BrBeA ethanol solution with a 1:1 molar ratio in a flask. After 1 hour, the solvent was removed by rotary evaporation, and then the white solid product was obtained at the bottom of the flask. The product was rinsed using diethyl ether three times and vacuum dried at 60 °C overnight.
Device fabrication
ITO glasses were successively cleaned with deionized water, acetone, and isopropyl alcohol solvents and were then treated with oxygen plasma for 5 min. The SnO2 colloid precursor (tin(IV) oxide, 15% in H2O colloidal dispersion) was diluted in ultrapure water with a volume ratio of 1:6.5. The precursor was spin coated onto the ITO substrate to form the SnO2 layer at 3000 rpm for 40 s, and then it was annealed at 150 °C for 30 min. To prepare a perovskite precursor, CsBr, and PbI2 were stoichiometrically dissolved in a mixed solvent of DMF and DMSO with a volume ratio of 6:1 to form a 0.8 M solution, and then the solution was filtered through a 0.22 μm pore PTFE filter after stirring at 70 °C for 2 h before use. The precursor solution was then spin coated onto the SnO2/ITO substrate firstly at 1000 rpm with an accelerating rate of 1000 rpm for 10 s and then at 3000 rpm with an accelerating rate of 3000 rpm for 40 s. After spin coating, the film was annealed firstly at 47 °C for 1 min and then at 200 °C for 10 min. BrBeAI isopropanol solutions with different concentrations (1, 2 and 4 mg mL−1) were spin coated onto the CsPbI2Br surface at 5000 rpm with an accelerating rate of 3000 rpm for 30 s, and then the films were annealed at 100 °C for 5 min. An HTL film was prepared by spin-coating spiro-OMeTAD solution onto the formed CsPbI2Br film at 4000 rpm with an accelerating rate of 3000 rpm for 30 s. The spiro-OMeTAD solution consisted of 72.3 mg spiro-OMeTAD, 17.5 μL bis(trifluoromethane) sulfonimide lithium salt (Li-TFSI) stock solution (520 mg Li-TFSI in 1 mL acetonitrile), 28.8 μL 4-tert-butylpyridine, and 1 mL chlorobenzene. Finally, 70 nm-thick Au film was deposited by thermal evaporation.
Characterization
The X-ray diffraction patterns were measured by using a Rigaku-2500 X-ray diffractometer with an X-ray tube (Cu Kα, λ = 1.5406 Å). The top-view and cross-sectional SEM images were obtained using a scanning electron microscope (SEM, HITACH2100). EQE was recorded using a Newport Oriel IQE-200 by a power source (Newport 300 W xenon lamp, 66920) with a monochromatic instrument (Newport Cornerstone 260). All J–V curves were measured using a source meter (Keithley 2420, USA) under AM 1.5 sunlight at an irradiance of 100 mW cm−2 provided by a solar simulator (Newport, Oriel Sol3A Class AAA, 94043A). Light intensity was calibrated using a monocrystalline silicon reference cell with a KG5 window (Newport, Oriel 91150). Impedance spectroscopy was measured using a Zennium electrochemical workstation (Zahner). The device area was 0.044 cm2.
