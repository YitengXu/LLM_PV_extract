Further optimization of the device architecture by combining the electrolytes as hole and electron buffer layers can significantly promote the photovoltaic performances of PSCs due to the integrated advantages of excellent alcohol processability, hole and electron mobility, interfacial dipole effect and good energy level alignment with electrodes. Moreover, the PSCs with the CSMEs interlayers based on narrow band-gap PTB7:PC71BM active layers show considerable improvement in power conversion efficiency (PCE), compared with P3HT:PCBM active layer-based devices. Devices with DPP-COOH and N719 modifications after thermal treatment at 120 °C exhibit the PCE of 8.0% and 7.6% under AM 1.5G irradiation, respectively, improving from 6.7% PCE of the pristine device without any interfacial layer. Encouragingly, the simultaneous use of CSMEs as hole and electron modification layers can boost the PCE to 8.2%. These findings demonstrate that the utilization of alcohol-soluble small molecule conjugated electrolytes with lower band gaps as interfacial modification layers is an effective and practical strategy for improving photovoltaic performance in PSCs.
Introduction
Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells1–3 comprising conjugated polymer donors and fullerene acceptors have attracted a great deal of interest for their promising advantages, including low cost, light weight, flexibility and large-scale fabrication through the roll-to-roll process. Recently, power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of BHJ solar cells have been optimized by the development of new conjugated polymer donors or new fullerene-derived acceptors, nanoscale morphology control and optimization of device structures.3–6 In addition, in order to be competitive with conventional photovoltaic technologies based on silicon or other inorganic materials, the efficiency, lifespan and solution processing of BHJ solar cells still require significant improvement.
The photovoltaic effect involves the generation of electrons and holes in the BHJ solar cells device under illumination and subsequent charge collection at corresponding electrodes. Photon absorption of organic optoelectronic materials often creates bound electron–hole pairs (excitons). Charge collection at corresponding electrodes requires dissociation of the excitons, which occurs only at the heterojunction interface between conjugated polymer donor and acceptor materials with different ionization potentials or electron affinities. In addition to new active layer materials’ design7 and morphology optimization of the donor/acceptor interface,8–11 interface engineering12–14 on BHJ solar cells device was of great importance in regulating the efficiency of charge separation and charge collection and hence, enhancing the power conversion efficiency (PCE) and device stability.
To improve the charge selectivity transmission and collection and minimize the energy barrier for charge extraction at the electrodes, the work function (WF) of the hole-transporting layer (HTL) with electron-blocking properties need to match the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level of donor, and the WF of the electron-transporting layer (ETL) with hole-blocking properties should match the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level of acceptor in the active layer. Therefore, HTL between the anode and active layer, as well as ETL between the cathode and active layer, is essential for achieving maximum BHJ device efficiency and lifespan. The functions of hole and electron interfacial layers (ILs) include: (a) minimizing the energy barrier for charge extraction; (b) selectively extracting one type of charge carrier and blocking the opposite charge carriers; (c) improving the interface stability between the electrode and the active layer; (d) modifying the surface property and altering the active layer morphology; and (e) forming the interfacial dipole for energy level alignment.
Recently, HTL layers contain several classes of materials, including highly doped polymer PEDOT:PSS, self-assembled monolayers, 3,3,3-trifluoropropyltrichlorosilane, metal oxide inorganic semiconductors (such as MoO3, V2O5, WO3, and NiO), graphene-based materials and conjugated polyelectrolytes (CPEs).15,16 On the other hand, the materials used as ETL include low WF metals or related salts (e.g. Ca and LiF), metal oxide semiconductors (e.g. TiO2 and ZnO) and fullerene derivatives. In addition, for the advantages of reducing series resistance, increasing internal built-in voltage, and modification of the electron extraction properties, the CPEs ETL have recently received increasing attention with the proven ability of improving PCE through solution processing, given the record high device efficiency.17–19 However, the function of CPEs in affecting hole injection/extraction has rarely been addressed. One reason is that directly depositing CPEs on top of ITO substrate can often lead to a decrease in the WF of electrodes due to interfacial dipole interaction, resulting in hole extraction barriers. Another limitation is that most CPEs show relatively low electrical conductivity, as demonstrated by Bazan et al.13
It was well known that diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP)-based conjugated small molecules and polymeric materials have been demonstrated to render high hole or electron transporting motilities and photovoltaic properties.20–22 Reynolds et al. had synthesized amphiphilic self-assembled diketopyrrolopyrrole-based oligothiophenes and investigated its semiconductive properties in field-effect transistors and solar cells.23 Conjugated small molecule electrolytes (CSMEs) are also neutral hydrophilic electrical molecules, which are attractive for achieving the beneficial properties of CPEs (alcohol solubility and pendent dipoles). However, to the best of our knowledge, CSMEs have not been tested for their ability as the IL in BHJ solar cells.
Herein, we synthesized a phenylthiophene-appended DPP, 3,6-bis-(5-benzoic acid-thiophen-2-yl)-2,5-bis-(2-ethylhexyl)-2,5-dihydro-pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-dione (DPP-COOH) conjugated small molecule and first utilized it as an IL in device fabrication. DPP-COOH was designed as the low band-gap π-conjugated core and was tethered with carboxylic acid groups, which enhance solubility and film-forming properties. It provided a novel way to improve photovoltaic performance with the CSMEs as ILs, particularly as ETL for its high charge carrier mobility and interfacial dipole effect. Moreover, a dye molecule di-tetrabutylammonium cis-bis(isothiocyanato)bis(2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylato)ruthenium(II) (N719) with a similar energy level and polarity of carboxylic acid group was also used to further testify the enhancement of efficiency and stability of BHJ solar cells when inserting the CSMEs into BHJ solar cell devices. By casting DPP-COOH and N719 onto an active layer surface as HTL or the ZnO thin film surface as ETL, the PCE increasing from 6.7% (pristine device without any IL) to 7.6%, 7.2% (HTL) and 8.0%, 7.6% (ETL) under AM 1.5G irradiation was achieved for cells with inverted structure, respectively. The excellent photovoltaic properties with CSMEs as ILs may be based on the following reasons: minimizing the energy barrier for charge transportation and extraction, improving the interface stability between the electrode and active layer, modifying the surface property and decreasing the interfacial defect of MoO3 and ZnO, and altering the active layer morphology and forming the interfacial dipole for energy level alignment. Combining their advantages as HTL and ETL, the device with DPP-COOH as HTL and ETL simultaneously showed the best PCE of 8.2%.
Results and discussion
A simple diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP)-based small molecule, DPP-COOH, was first synthesized using a palladium-catalyzed Suzuki–Miyaura cross-coupling reaction in Scheme S1 (ESI†). To make this small molecule with a relatively more appropriate energy level alignment with a MoO3/Ag anode, the phenylthiophene-appended DPP was designed as the low bandgap π-conjugated core. In addition, the carboxylic acid groups were tethered with this core to enhance solubility in alcohol solvent and film-forming properties in device fabrication. In addition, DPP class with high hole and electron mobility was a good requirement for obtaining excellent photovoltaic performance to ensure effective charge carrier transport to the electrodes and reduce the photocurrent loss in BHJ solar cells.24–27 The kinked DPP-COOH backbone-induced packing architecture offered a fascinating new set of structural parameters to be tuned in the quest for BHJ device structures that could maximize the PCE of the device. As expected, DPP-COOH was soluble in an alcohol solvent such as methanol or ethanol. In addition, the improvement in device performance originated from the morphological optimization and alteration of electronic energy level alignment at the heterointerfaces, particularly for dipole formation at the interface of the active layer and metal electrode.28 Hence, DPP-COOH and N719 with similar energy levels and polarity of carboxylic acid groups as HTL and ETL, respectively, were used as the hole and electron ILs to optimize the device performance in Scheme 1. To investigate the effect of morphologies on photovoltaic properties, the molecular orientation and liquid crystalline organization of DPP-COOH thin film under thermal annealing was explored by polarized optical microscopy (POM) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), shown in Fig. 1. With an increase in the annealing temperature, the emergence of highly birefringent liquid crystalline domains with sizes of more than several hundred nanometers from POM images indicated the spontaneous formation of well-assembled crystallites within this film at 120 °C thermal annealing. The molecular orientation nano-structure might be conducive to exciton dissociation and charge collection at the electrode. Therefore, selection of 120 °C would be considered an appropriate thermal treatment temperature for devices with CSMEs as ILs. The UV-vis absorption spectra of DPP-COOH and N719 spin-casted from methanol solution (Fig. 1) presented the absorption peaks (λmax) at 368 nm, 650 nm for DPP-COOH and 317 nm, 390 nm, 550 nm for N719. The wide absorption peak at 650 nm for DPP-COOH corresponded to the π–π* (HOMO–LUMO) transition, which was likely intrinsic to the single molecule with restricted intra-molecular motion. The absorption bands of these small molecules extended from 300 nm to a lower energy level of ∼800 nm in the films, and the optical band gaps of DPP-COOH and N719 were estimated to be 1.55 eV and 1.86 eV, respectively, from the absorption edge. The HOMO energy levels of DPP-COOH and N719 films had been determined to be approximately −5.47 eV and −5.05 eV, respectively.

The nano-morphology of HTLs deposited on top of the active layer can significantly further affect the charge transport and collection in the corresponding electrode. To examine the impact of the active layer on the morphology of DPP-COOH and N719 interlayers, we first measured the pristine morphology of CSMEs. Fig. S1 (ESI†) shows the tapping-mode atomic force microscopy (AFM) high resolution and phase images of CSMEs spin-coating onto ITO substrates with and without thermal annealing at 120 °C for 10 min. The DPP-COOH film showed many crystalline domains and a relatively smooth surface with a root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 1.63 nm, whereas N719 exhibited a typically tiny and dense cluster nanostructure with a RMS roughness of 2.39 nm. After thermal annealing, the crystalline regions of DPP-COOH grew up to larger size (100–500 nm) and the RMS roughness increased to 20.5 nm, which was in favor of enhancing the interfacial areas between the active layer and the corresponding electrode.29 However, the film of N719 showed a fine distribution and denser cluster of polarity molecules with a RMS roughness of 3.12 nm.
The AFM measurements were also carried out to further investigate the influence of the active layer on the nano-morphologically spontaneous formation of the well-organized DPP-COOH liquid crystalline molecule and N719 dye molecule in Fig. S2 (ESI†). The high resolution and phase images of the pristine P3HT:PCBM active layer illustrated nanoscale phase separation and a smooth surface morphology with a RMS roughness of 1.32 nm, which could enable a large interface area for exciton dissociation. After spin-coating CSMEs onto the active layer surface, we then further measured the surface morphology of P3HT:PCBM/DPP-COOH and P3HT:PCBM/N719 films with and without thermal annealing at 120 °C for 10 min. All of the films displayed similar nanoscale phase-separated morphologies. Compared with the film without thermal annealing, P3HT:PCBM/DPP-COOH film showed RMS roughness from 3.31 nm to 5.16 nm and had an orientation crystalline nanostructure with a higher molecular order after thermal annealing, providing a better pathway for the transportation of generated charge carriers. P3HT:PCBM/N719 film showed RMS roughness from 2.46 nm to 3.51 nm and had a denser cluster nanostructure. The rough surfaces implied better interfacial adhesion between HTL and the MoO3 layer, resulting in better charge transport.30
The photovoltaic performances of the devices based on the CSMEs as HTLs were quite sensitive to the CSMEs’ morphologies. Therefore, the morphology of DPP-COOH liquid crystalline and N719 dye molecules as HTL affected by the active layer was further investigated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) as shown in Fig. 1. After CSMEs were spin-coated onto the active layer surface as HTLs with thermal annealing at 120 °C, more orderly nano-morphologies could be observed. The N719 dye molecule clusters in nanoscales were well dispersed, and DPP-COOH liquid crystalline nanofibrils presented high crystalline orientation on the surface of active layer, which could be beneficial for charge transport and collection at the anode. Meanwhile, the crystalline orientation and orderly structure of DPP-COOH on the active layer could yield better carrier transport channels with respect to N719, which can, in turn, favor high Jsc and FF of the device.
Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) was utilized to characterize the intrinsic electronic characteristics of the polymer–metal interfaces in films. As HTLs, CSMEs were spin-coated between the active and MoO3 layers. To verify the effect of CSMEs on the MoO3 thin layer, ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) was carried out to study the energy levels of MoO3, DPP-COOH/MoO3 and N719/MoO3 thin layers. Observing from Fig. S3 (ESI†), the WF for MoO3, DPP-COOH/MoO3 and N719/MoO3 thin layers were determined to be approximately −5.53 eV, −5.27 eV and −4.99 eV, respectively, which are summarized in Fig. 2. The different in WF (δΦAC) between the anode (Ag) and cathode induced a potential gradient across the active layer. The CSMEs interlayers that reduced the WF (negative interfacial dipole (Δ)) at the anode interface decrease δΦAC and thus reduced Voc, which was consistent with the devices’ data. The dipole orientation of the device architecture with CSMEs as HTLs was downward. In addition, the CSMEs as HTLs induce larger interfacial dipoles with anode electrodes with the interfacial dipole energy Δ as high as 1.2 eV and 0.5 eV for N719 and DPP-COOH, respectively, resulting in the formation of a hole extraction barrier. Moreover, the WF of DPP-COOH/MoO3 (−5.27 eV) displayed more appropriately with the HOMO of donor materials than that of N719/MoO3 (−4.99 eV). However, several other factors must be considered when using the CSMEs as HTLs, including the potential to directly contribute to the photocurrent within the device and the charge mobility of the device with these HTLs.

The CSMEs as HTLs between the P3HT:PCBM active layer and MoO3 played an important role in the performance of inverted single-junction solar cells in Fig. S4 (ESI†). It was imperative to optimize the device structure to improve the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the inverted BHJ solar cells. The optimal thickness of MoO3 was found to be around 6 nm as determined by J–V measurements. Without the CSMEs layer, inverted BHJ solar cells showed a short-circuit current (Jsc) of 8.31 mA cm−2, open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.59 V, fill factor (FF) of 59% and corresponding PCE of 2.9%. After inserting CSMEs between the active layer and MoO3, an inverted device with a DPP-COOH layer showed the photovoltaic performance from Jsc of 8.92 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.59 V, FF of 48%, PCE of 2.6% to Jsc of 8.86 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.58 V, FF of 57%, and a corresponding PCE of 3.0% after thermal annealing, whereas the device with an N719 layer from Jsc of 10.47 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.57 V, FF of 50%, PCE of 2.9% to Jsc of 9.24 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.58 V, FF of 58%, and a corresponding PCE of 3.1% after thermal annealing. The Voc of 0.58 V or 0.57 V from the inverted BHJ solar cells with CSMEs were lower than the Voc of 0.59 V from the cells without ILs, which was due to the lower δΦAC in inverted BHJ solar cells. This observation was in good agreement with the band alignment from UPS results. On the other hand, the larger Jsc of the devices with a CSMEs layer arose from the stronger light absorption intensity (UV-vis absorption spectra and IPCE response), higher hole mobility based on the SCLC results (ESI†), and enhanced contact between the active layer and anode because of the amphiphilic property of CSMEs; the device performance parameters are summarized in Table 1. The devices with N719 as an IL between the active layer and MoO3 possessed stronger light absorption, resulting in improved Jsc, probably due to clustered N719 acting as an optical spacer for the redistribution of an optical field in the active layer.31

To evaluate the suitability of the newly developed CSMEs as a HTL, PSCs were fabricated with a PTB7:PC71BM active layer to further testify to the potential interfacial engineering for obtaining high performance BHJ solar cells.24 The J–V curves of the cells with appropriate lower band-gap active layers were presented in Fig. S5 (ESI†), and detailed data for Voc, Jsc, FF and PCE are included in Table 1. The PCE of device without a CSMEs layer is 6.7% (Voc of 0.72 V, Jsc of 14.6 mA cm−2, and FF of 64%), comparable to the referred value.24 After optimizing the interface of the oil-soluble active layer and polar inorganic metal oxides with an amphiphilic CSMEs layer, the devices with N719 and DPP-COOH layers showed a drastic enhancement in photovoltaic performance with the best PCE of 7.2% (Voc of 0.72 V, Jsc of 16.76 mA cm−2, and FF of 60%) and 7.6% (Voc of 0.72 V, Jsc of 16.24 mA cm−2, and FF of 65%) after thermal treatment, respectively. Compared with pristine cells, the devices with CSMEs showed a significant increase in Jsc and a slight reduction in Voc. The donor polymer of the narrow band-gap PTB7:PC71BM active layer had deeper HOMO levels than that of P3HT:PC61BM active layer. The relative lower WF reduction of DPP-COOH/MoO3 as the HTL resulted in a more suitable selection for interfacial modification with the narrow band-gap PTB7:PC71BM active layer, compared with N719/MoO3 as the HTL. In fact, the PCE results of the devices confirmed the aforementioned evidence.
In general, CSMEs ILs as ETLs in photovoltaic devices have been reported. We rationalized that the utilization of alcohol-soluble CSMEs as anode ILs could offer a new strategy to improve the photovoltaic performance of the device, which displayed great potential in practical applications, particularly for the fabrication of environmentally friendly devices. A second type of device with CSMEs as ETLs on the surface of ZnO was processed to probe the influences by the interfacial dipole alignment of CSMEs on photovoltaic properties. UPS measurement was also employed to further probe the electronic properties of CSMEs as ETLs in Fig. S6 (ESI†), which could enable an evaluation of the energy level of ZnO, as well as Δ values of the interface between ZnO and the active layer. The Δ is calculated as the difference in measured ESEC values of the film (N719/ZnO or DPP-COOH/ZnO) and the pristine ZnO film.32 The HOMO energy levels for ZnO, ZnO/DPP-COOH and ZnO/N719 thin layers were calculated as −7.75 eV, −7.62 eV and −7.52 eV, respectively. Based on these HOMO energies and optical gaps obtained from the onset of absorption spectra, the estimated LUMO energy levels for ZnO, ZnO/DPP-COOH and ZnO/N719 thin layers were −4.46 eV, −4.28 eV and −4.09 eV, respectively. The differences in energy levels among pristine ZnO, ZnO/N719 and ZnO/DPP-COOH implied that the energy levels of ZnO could be tuned by the CSMEs. Most importantly, these energy differences indicated that the good band alignment of inverted BHJ solar cells with CSMEs, particularly for the device based on the PTB7:PC71BM active layer, compared with the device without ILs (Fig. 2). Hence, a large Voc from the inverted BHJ solar cells with CSMEs was anticipated. In addition, the built-in electrical field in the BHJ layer induced by ZnO/N719 and ZnO/DPP-COOH ETLs was enhanced, deriving from the adverse Δ with a built-in electrical field,33 which could promote exciton dissociation, increase photogenerated-carrier collection and the Jsc of the device. Furthermore, the advantage of CSMEs as ETLs also lies in their ability to produce large Δ with anode electrodes, which could form a better contact between the active and ZnO layers.
The space charge-limited-current (SCLC) model (Fig. S7, ESI†) was further used to investigate the carrier mobility of CSMEs modification in the device. Furthermore, as the enhancement in photovoltaic properties can also be related to charge transport and collection, the impact of CSMEs on charge carrier mobilities had also been assessed in BHJ solar cells. The built-in electrical field in the BHJ layer induced by CSMEs as ETLs was expected to promote exciton dissociation and increase photogenerated-carrier collection.34 However, the reverse built-in electrical field in the BHJ layer was induced by CSMEs as HTLs resulted in the formation of a hole extraction barrier. To evaluate the apparent charge carrier mobility in the active layer, J0.5–V characteristics of single charge carrier devices were measured using SCLC according to the Mott–Gurney equation (details of the mobility measurement is described in ESI†).35–39 As plotted in Fig. S7 and summarized in Table S1 (ESI†), the apparent electron mobility of the devices increased from 2.94 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 to 3.55 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 4.16 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 and hole mobility 2.74 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 to 4.92 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 4.01 × 10−4 after insertion of N719 and DPP-COOH ILs into devices, respectively. The results revealed that the incorporation of CSMEs into the ILs could achieve the increase of both electron and hole mobility (the dual carrier mobility) and more balanced charge transport in the devices. In addition, the inserting of CSMEs modification could avoid the current leakage and decrease bias-dependent carrier recombination, subsequently yielding the increased Jsc and FF of the device (J–V characteristics under dark conditions), compared with devices without ILs.
It is well known that the different self-assembly architecture of ETLs results in various organizations of the active layer nanostructures. The orientation and accumulation of CSMEs on the surface of ZnO was investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements. From the XPS peaks in Fig. S8 (ESI†), one peak at 1021.1 eV corresponding to Zn 2p 3/2 for Zn–O bonds in ZnO was observed, whereas there were two peaks displayed in ZnO/N719 and ZnO/DPP-COOH at 1021.1 eV and 1021.3 eV, respectively, revealing the self-assembly of CSMEs driven by the potential interaction between ZnO and CSMEs. On the other hand, the binding energy at 530.1 eV (low-binding-energy) is attributed to the O 1s level in the stoichiometric ZnO structure, bonding to Zn atoms. The binding energy at 531.4 eV (high binding energy) is associated with surface deficiencies in O 1s, such as the O 1s in zinc hydroxide, Zn(OH)2, or the oxygen species adsorbed by the surface hydroxyl groups.40 In addition, the intensity of the high-binding-energy oxygen atoms was significantly reduced with the modification of CSMEs, indicating that the oxygen deficiency of ZnO/N719 and ZnO/DPP-COOH could be passivated to offer close contact with the active layer and an efficient path for electron transport.41 The surface topographies of pristine ZnO, ZnO/N719 and ZnO/DPP-COOH were further investigated by AFM, and the correlative results are shown in Fig. S9 (ESI†) and Fig. 3. Compared with pristine ZnO with an RMS roughness of 1.63 nm, the surface of the films exhibited greater roughness of 2.27 nm and 2.05 nm without thermal annealing, whereas becoming relatively smoother at 2.0 nm and 1.47 nm after modification with N719 and DPP-COOH CSMEs with thermal annealing at 120 °C for 10 min. The larger roughness structure, satisfying the requirement of the device performance, vastly increased the surface area of CSMEs and benefited contact with the active layer by enhancing the partial permeation of the active layer. After spin-coating the active layers P3HT:PCBM and PTB7:PC71BM onto the surfaces of the ETLs, AFM was also carried out to test the influence of the CSMEs layer on the active layer morphology. Compared with the surface roughness of P3HT:PCBM on pristine ZnO thin film (RMS: 1.32 nm), the respective surface roughness of P3HT:PCBM on ZnO/N719 and ZnO/DPP-COOH thin films were 1.07 and 1.17 nm without annealing, and 0.88 nm and 0.77 nm with thermal annealing treatments at 120 °C for 10 min. The smoother surface of active layer might be attributed to the better interfacial adhesion between active layer and ZnO and the good partial permeation of active layer, particularly for the DPP-COOH modification thin films, which is consistent with the results from the PTB7:PC71BM active layer (Fig. 3). In addition, the much finer pattern of the film with DPP-COOH modification than that with N719 annealing at 120 °C could be observed, suggesting a more intimate interface between ZnO and the PTB7:PC71BM active layer, which might be the structural similarity of the DPP-COOH and active layer material.

Current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of P3HT:PCBM and PTB7:PC71BM solar cells with CSMEs as ETLs are displayed in Fig. S10 and S11 (ESI†), and the detailed device parameters are shown in Table 2. The performances of the devices with CSMEs were improved with larger Jsc, better Voc and slightly better FF, particularly for the devices with CSMEs modification and thermal annealing treatments, compared with the device without IL. The slight increase in Voc (from 0.72 V to 0.73 V or 0.74 V) could be ascribed to the better energy level alignments of devices and the CSMEs chains forming an interfacial dipole moment with its negative pole pointing towards ZnO, which could increase the HOMO and LUMO levels of the active layer. An increase of IPCE at wavelengths from 300 nm to 800 nm and the enhancement of a built-in electrical field originating from the inversed interfacial dipole were also observed after inserting CSMEs, which led to the Jsc of pristine device without any ILs changing from 14.6 mA cm−2 to 15.44 mA cm−2 (without annealing) and 16.01 mA cm−2 (thermal annealing) for the devices with DPP-COOH layer, and to 15.29 mA cm−2 (without annealing) and 15.92 mA cm−2 (thermal annealing) for the devices with N719 layer. Finally, 7.6% and 8.0% of PCE with N719 and DPP-COOH (thermal annealing) as ETLs were obtained. The maximum IPCE with IL was more than 70%, indicating efficient photon-to-electron conversion. In addition, J–V characteristics under dark conditions indicated that good diode characteristics were obtained from both devices using CSMEs as ETLs (Fig. S12, ESI†). As a result, the energy barrier for electron injection and collection could be reduced. All data were consistent with results from the P3HT:PCBM active layer in Fig. S10 (ESI†). Moreover, the lower band-gap PTB7:PC71BM with amphiphilic CSMEs ILs significantly improved the device performance, relative to P3HT:PCBM active layer due to better energy alignment of the device (Fig. 2).

Combining the advantages of CSMEs as HTL and ETL, the devices with CSMEs as HTL and ETL simultaneously were fabricated to further boost the inherent performance, resulting in a considerable gain in overall photovoltaic output and yielding the best PCE of 8.2% for the device with DPP-COOH ILs. The enhanced performance could be explained by a larger δΦAC, stronger built-in electrical field, redistribution of an optical field in the active layer, interfacial modification between the active layer and corresponding electrodes for the amphiphilic properties of the CSMEs and the higher carrier mobility after inserting the CSMEs. All of the device parameters based on PTB7:PC71BM active layers with various optimizing structures are summarized in Fig. 4. Except for the device efficiency improvement, enhanced device stability from the optimized interfacial layers was also observed in Fig. S13 (ESI†). Thus, the amphiphilic CSMEs with a low bandgap π-conjugated core and the carboxylic acid groups as ILs were proven to be a good way to slow the degradation of devices.

Conclusions
Through the interfacial modification by the novel low band-gap CSMEs DPP-COOH and N719, the higher efficiency inverted PSC has been achieved, particularly for the device based on the PTB7:PC71BM active layer. Comparing with N719, the self-assembled DPP-COOH as IL reveals better photovoltaic performance due to its highly oriented nanofiber morphology, a more appropriate energy level alignment of the device and relatively good hole and electron carrier mobility. The PCE of the device without the CSMEs layer is 6.7% (Voc of 0.72 V, Jsc of 14.6 mA cm−2, and FF of 64%). As HTLs of CSMEs, the devices with N719 and DPP-COOH layers were further improved with the best PCE of 7.2% (Voc of 0.72 V, Jsc of 16.76 mA cm−2, and FF of 60%) and 7.6% (Voc of 0.72 V, Jsc of 16.24 mA cm−2, and FF of 65%) after thermal treatment, respectively. The enhanced performance is attributed to the high hole carrier mobility, orderly transport channel and the redistribution of an optical field in the active layer with amphiphilic CSMEs as HTLs. On the other hand, as ETLs of CSMEs, 7.6% and 8.0% of PCE with N719 and DPP-COOH after annealing at 120 °C were obtained for the PSCs due to its interfacial dipole effect, excellent electron mobility and better energy level alignment of devices. Regarding further optimization of the device architecture, 8.2% of the best PCE was achieved when using DPP-COOH as hole and electron modification layers simultaneously. Moreover, the devices with the CSMEs showed high stability in air at room temperature. These findings demonstrate that employing alcohol-soluble small molecule conjugated electrolytes is also a promising strategy to fabricate high-performance solution-processed PSCs, specifically for printable appropriate lower band-gap active layers.
