    , Accepted 18th December 2013First published on 18th December 2013AbstractThe design and discovery of green and highly efficient visible-light driven catalysts hold significant importance towards efficient harvesting, conversion and utilization of the full-spectrum solar energy. Here in this work, we report several wide band gap (>3.1 eV) semiconducting nanostructures counterintuitively showing excellent catalytic activity under solar light towards organic dye degradation. These nanostructured stannates include amorphous ZnSnO3 nanocubes and Zn2SnO4–SnO2 nanocrystal assemblies, which possess the merits of high activity, low cost, absence of toxicity, and ease of synthesis. Hydroxyl radicals (˙OH) are confirmed to be the major active species responsible for the dye degradation reactions. The catalysis tests under monochromatic light and optical characterization revealed remarkable activities in the visible light range due to populated defect states in these semiconductor nanostructures. Finally, the Zn2SnO4–SnO2 hetero-junction nanocrystal assemblies produced by slow-ramping thermal decomposition demonstrated very high photocatalytic efficiency under visible light, with dye molecules almost fully degraded in 20 min. Besides more visible-light-active defect states and larger crystallite size, the coherent (hetero-epitaxial) interfaces and strong type II heterojunction interaction between the spinel Zn2SnO4 and rutile SnO2 nano-grains might be the main reasons for the drastically improved photocatalytic performance of the slow-ramp Zn2SnO4–SnO2.
1. Introduction
Environmental remediation particularly in water treatment, disinfection and air purification are vital research issues toward sustainable ecosystem and environment. Since the early study of the photocatalytic oxidation of organic compounds in aqueous systems by Carey in 1976,1 extensive investigations have been conducted on the photocatalytic decomposition of hazardous wastes into harmless chemicals.2–4 In particular, the efficient utilization of full-spectrum solar energy in this regard has been pursued intensively. For example, visible-light or solar-light active catalysts for waste water purification and hydrogen generation demonstrate their unique merits in greenness, low-cost, and sustainability. The visible-light active TiO2 based nanostructures have been intensively studied, mainly through alloying of either transition-metal cations or anions into TiO2 (ref. 5 and 6) in order to tune its band gap in the visible-light region. As a new class of photocatalysts, ternary or quaternary oxide based alternatives containing bismuth or vanadium have been found to be efficient for organic molecule decomposition under visible light illumination, such as NaBiO3,7 Bi2MoxOy,8–11 Bi2MoxW1−xO6,12 BiVO4,13–15 Ca2Bi2O4,16 Bi2WO6,7 and SnNb2O6.17,18 The downsides of these Bi and V containing compounds are their high toxicity and relatively high cost due to the limited availability of these elements. Therefore, two issues arose from here. Firstly, the search and design of efficient, green, and low-cost visible-light active photocatalysts are highly demanded. Secondly, most visible-light active photocatalysts require small band-gap to enable highly efficient visible-light absorption. It remains counterintuitive to expect a high catalytic efficiency under solar light for wide band-gap semiconductors, although defect induced visible light trapping may help enhance the absorption efficiency.19 On the other hand, the impacts of defects on the visible photocatalytic activity were rarely investigated.20 Hence, the full understanding of the work principles is necessary to guide the material design and screening to fully utilize the sunlight.
Here, several green and low-cost zinc stannate nanomaterial photocatalysts have been found to be highly efficient under visible continuous light and monochromatic light towards degradation of rhodamine B (RB) for the first time, including amorphous mesoporous ZnSnO3 nanocubes and Zn2SnO4–SnO2 nanocrystal assemblies. Although these stannate semiconductors have wide band gaps, they possess radiative defect states in a broad visible region, which imply that defect tuning can be as effective as band gap tuning towards utilizing solar energy. Hydroxyl radicals (˙OH) were confirmed to be the key active oxidizers in the degradation reaction. By utilizing the rational thermal engineering of zinc stannate, Zn2SnO4–SnO2 nanocrystal assemblies with controlled crystallite size and defect states were obtained via a slow ramping process. Excellent photocatalytic performance under solar light was achieved. The hetero-epitaxial interfaces and stronger interactions between Zn2SnO4 and SnO2 in the slow-ramp Zn2SnO4–SnO2 sample are found to greatly enhance the photocatalytic activity as a result of promoted charge transfer efficiency.
2. Experimental section
Materials preparation
The precursor–porous zinc hydroxystannate ZnSn(OH)6 (ZHS) nanocubes have been synthesized via a simple ionic substitution solution reaction at room temperature according to the method reported in the literature.21 By annealing these ZHS mesoporous nanocubes at 350 °C and 850 °C for 9 hours, respectively, ZnSnO3 (ZS) and Zn2SnO4–SnO2 (DZS–SnO2) nanoparticles were obtained. The ramping rate is generally controlled at 20 °C min−1.
Material characterization
The crystal structure of the synthesized samples was investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD). The XRD measurements were conducted at room temperature using a Bruker AXS D8 ADVANCE diffractometer (Cu Kα radiation, λ = 1.541 Å). The accelerating voltage, emission current, and scanning speed were set to 40 kV, 40 mA, and 5 degree min−1, respectively. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) were carried out using the TA Instruments Q600 in a nitrogen atmosphere with ceramic sample pans. The data were collected with a scan rate of 5 °C min−1 over a temperature range of 0–1000 °C. The composition, structure and morphology of the stannate nanoparticles were further characterized using electron microscopes, such as scanning electron microscopes (JEOL 6335F FE-SEM and FEI Quanta FESEM) and a scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM, FEI Tecnai-12), both equipped with energy dispersive X-ray spectrometers (EDXs). A JEOL 2010 High resolution TEM (HRTEM) was used to acquire atomistic lattice images of various stannate nanostructures.
Varian Cary 5000 and Perkin Elmer 900 ultraviolet-visible-near-infrared (UV-Vis-NIR) spectrophotometers were used for optical absorption measurements. Room temperature micro-photoluminescence (μPL) measurements were carried out using a HeCd continuous wavelength (CW) laser with an excitation wavelength of 325 nm in order to investigate the optical properties of the fabricated stannate nanostructures. The nanoparticle samples were deposited on a clean Si substrate by a dry imprint technique. The laser was focused onto the sample with a spot size of ∼18 μm2 by a reflective objective (36×, NA = 0.5). The luminescence was collected by the same objective, dispersed by the 500 mm monochromator and detected by a nitrogen cooled charge-coupled device (CCD). XPS experiments were performed on a scanning Auger Multi Probe PHI Spectrometer (Model 25-120) equipped with an Al source (1486.6 eV) at 200 W. The signal was filtered with a hemispherical analyzer. All the binding energies were calibrated to the C 1s peak at 284.6 eV of the surface adventitious carbon.
The specific surface areas were determined by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) nitrogen adsorption and desorption method using a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 physisorption analyzer. The pore size distributions were calculated using the Barret–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) model based on nitrogen desorption isotherms.
Photocatalytic studies
In a typical experiment, ca. 20 mg stannate nanoparticles were dispersed in a vial containing 20 mL of aqueous Rhodamine B (RB). Prior to illumination, the mixture was sonicated in the dark for 15 min to establish the adsorption/desorption equilibrium. The suspensions were then centrifuged. The UV/VIS spectrum of the supernatant was taken as a reference of the RB solution before the photocatalysis test (0 min = C0). Afterwards, the suspension was irradiated with a 22 W UV ring lamp (Luzchem, USA) owing an emission peaked at 365 nm. Degradation was monitored by analyzing aliquots withdrawn from the suspension at various illumination time intervals. The aliquot samples containing the photocatalyst and RB were centrifuged, and the absorption spectra of the supernatant solutions were recorded in a spectral range of 400–700 nm. The RB concentrations were determined using the Beer–Lambert law A = αc, where A is the maximum RB absorbance at 557 nm, α is the RB molar absorptivity, and  is the sample cell length (1 cm). RB degradation was expressed as C/C0versus UV-illumination time, where C0 is the initial concentration.
The photocatalyst (ZnSnO3, Zn2SnO4–SnO2, TiO2) powders were directly dispersed in 20 mL of ca. 6.8 × 10−3 g L−1 RB aqueous solution with a concentration of ca. 1.0 g L−1. And the absorber/solution thickness was about 2.5 cm. A 150 W solar simulator (Model: 96000, Newport optics) with an Air Mass (AM) 1.5 global filter was used as a light source (beam diameter: 5 cm). The average light intensity striking on the reaction solution surface was ∼300 mW cm−2. For the monochromatic light test, the above light beam was passed through various bandpass filters (λ = 300, 420, 470, 550 nm, band width ∼10 nm, beam diameter: 2.5 cm). The monochromatic light intensity was measured using an optical power meter (Model: 842-PE, Newport optics) combined with a thermopile sensor (Model: 818P-040-25, Newport optics). All monochromatic beams had an identical power density of ∼7 mW cm−2.
The formation rate of ˙OH at the photo-illuminated sample/water interface was detected by PL spectroscopy using coumarin (COU) as a probe molecule. COU can readily react with ˙OH and produce the highly fluorescent product 7-hydroxycoumarin (7HC). Experimental procedures were as follows: at ambient temperature, 0.1 g of catalyst powder sample was dispersed in 20 mL of 1 mmol L−1 COU aqueous solution (absorber/solution thickness: ∼1 cm). The suspension was allowed to reach an adsorption–desorption equilibrium among the photocatalyst, COU, and water before illumination by sonication in the dark for ∼20 minutes. Additional experimental results indicated that the absorbed COU and 7HC on various semiconductor photocatalysts were less than 10%. Then, the above mixtures were irradiated under solar light beam (the beam condition has been described earlier). After solar simulator illumination for every 10 or 20 min, the reaction solution was processed to measure the PL intensity using a Horiba Jobin-Yvon Spex Fluorolog-3 fluorimeter. The excitation wavelength was 344 nm and the scanning speed was 100 nm min−1. The width of the emission slit was set to be 2.5 nm.
3. Results and discussion
In this work, as-synthesized ZHS nanoparticle powders were used as precursors to obtain different zinc stannate semiconductor nanoparticles through post-synthetic thermal annealing. DSC measurements of the as-synthesized ZHS nanoparticles (Fig. 1a) exhibited two peaks at 204 °C and 712 °C as a result of a two-step thermal decomposition process. At the first step ZHS is dehydrated to ZnSnO3 (ZS), and then further decomposed to Zn2SnO4(DZS)–SnO2 nanocomposites at the second step.22 The XRD spectra in Fig. 1b confirm that after the thermal treatment, the perovskite ZHS (JCPDS 20-1455) decomposed into amorphous ZS nanocubes and spinel DZS (JCPDS 73-1725)-rutile SnO2 (JCPDS 41-1445) nanocrystal assemblies after annealing at 350 °C and 850 °C, respectively. Fig. 1c and d further confirm the amorphous structure of ZS with a stoichiometric Zn:Sn:O ratio of 1:1:3.

Fig. 2a and b show the SEM and TEM images of the as-synthesized ZHS mesoporous nanocube precursor. The TEM analysis (Fig. 2b, upper right inset) revealed the single crystalline and mesoporous nanocube structure with an average diameter of 37 ± 8 nm (30–50 nm) and relatively smooth surfaces. The mesoporous nature of individual nanocubes after thermal treatment at 350 °C for 9 h is clearly displayed in the brightness contrast shown in Fig. 2c. The obtained amorphous structure in ZS was identified by the diffusive ring-like electron diffraction pattern in the inset of Fig. 2c. In contrast, the obtained DZS–SnO2 after higher temperature thermal treatment (850 °C) displayed a solid and crystalline structure with polyhedron and other irregular shapes (Fig. 2c and d & S1†). Their lattice images clearly revealed a spinel DZS structure (FCC, Fdm, a = 8.610 Å) with exactly matched lattice spacings to the {220}, {311}, and {131} lattice planes (Fig. 2e) and a rutile SnO2 tetragonal structure (P42/mnm, a = 4.738 Å, c = 3.187 Å) with {110}, {011}, and {101} lattice planes identified (Fig. 2f). The specific surface area and inner pore size evolution of zinc stannate after thermal treatment was shown in the ESI (Fig. S1 and Table S1†), which further reflected the above morphology/structure evolution analysis.

The band gaps of zinc stannate based semiconductors have reported values ranging from 3.2 eV to 4.1 eV,23,24 similar to SnO2.25–27 Hence, firstly, photodegradation of Rhodamine-B (RB) dye molecules was studied upon stannate nanostructures' exposure to UV light centered at λ = 365 nm in comparison with commercial TiO2 (Fig. 3a–c). The degradation of RB under UV light also was tested as a blank sample for comparison. Only 5% and 30% of RB contents were left after 2 h illumination in the presence of ZS and DZS–SnO2, respectively. However, RB was fully decomposed after only half an hour of UV illumination in the presence of the same amount of TiO2 nanoparticles. In order to quantitatively compare their photocatalytic activity, reaction kinetics were analyzed based on the UV-vis-NIR absorption spectroscopy data in Fig. 3. Most of the photo-degradation reactions of organic molecules obey the first order reaction kinetics,28–30 where the relationship between the degradation rate and the illumination time t can be described by ln(C/C0) = −k t. Here, k is the degradation rate constant, C0 is the initial concentration, and C represents the RB concentration after an illumination time of t. Fig. 3d shows the ln(C/C0) versus illumination time plots for the three photocatalysts examined. The first order linear regression was fitted and used to determine the reaction rate constant k, which increased from 1.80 × 10−4 min−1 in the blank sample to 9.5 × 10−3, 0.028, and 0.15 min−1 in the presence of DZS–SnO2, ZS, and TiO2 nanoparticles in solutions, respectively.

(d) First-order reaction kinetic plots for photocatalytic degradation of RB solution with or without (blank) the above photocatalysts. The initial RB concentration was C0 = 5 mg L−1, while C represents the RB concentration as a function of illumination time t. 
When the photocatalytic measurements were performed under a solar simulator, which mainly contains visible light (∼44% of the sun's energy), the results were quite fascinating and are illustrated in Fig. 4. RB was fully degraded after 1 hour using ZS and DZS–SnO2 as photocatalysts, demonstrating a much higher activity under solar-simulator light than under UV light. Instead, over 40% of RB was intact even after 2 hours in the presence of the same amount of TiO2 P25 photocatalysts. From the fitting of the data in Fig. 4d, the reaction rate constants were calculated to be 0.0712, 0.0721, 6.25 × 10−3 min−1, and 2.50 × 10−4 min−1 for ZS, DZS–SnO2, TiO2, and no photocatalyst (blank), respectively. The photo-degradation reaction occurs in ZS and DZS–SnO2 10 times faster than in the presence of the same amount of TiO2 nanoparticles under solar-simulator illumination.

To gain further understanding of the photocatalytic properties provided by these stannate nanostructures, their wavelength-dependent activity towards photodegradation of RB was measured. Therefore, four monochromatic illuminations were selected using bandpass filters, with the results shown in Fig. 5a. The intensity of each illumination was ∼7 mW cm−2, only about 1/75 of the intensity of the full-spectrum beam generated by a solar simulator. It can be seen that the P25 TiO2 nanoparticles show higher efficiency than ZS and DZS–SnO2 nanoparticles in the UV range with the best performance shown under 300 nm light. However, both ZS and DZS–SnO2 reveal much better activities than TiO2 in the visible range up to 550 nm. After exposure for 30 minutes under 420, 470, and 550 nm illumination, nearly no RB was degraded within the TiO2 suspension, while over 20% of RB was converted in both stannate suspensions for λ > 400 nm. These results are consistent with the previous results shown in Fig. 3 and 4.
 Fig. 5  (a) Wavelength dependence of RB decomposition in the presence of different photocatalysts upon illumination of monochromatic lights with various wavelengths (300, 420, 470, 550 ± 5 nm) for 30 min. These monochromatic lights generated using different bandpass filters have nearly identical intensities (∼7 mW cm−2). (b) Absorption spectra and (c) photoluminescence spectra of amorphous ZS (black) and DZS–SnO2 nanocrystal assemblies (blue). The inset in 5b is used for extracting optical band gaps of these zinc stannate based nanoparticles. The PL spectra of ZS and DZS–SnO2 ensembles were excited using a 325 nm HeCd laser with a beam power of 460 W cm−2. 
The optical and electronic properties of these nanoparticles have been investigated by optical absorption and photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopies shown in Fig. 5b and c. Despite the strongest absorption of ZS and DZS–SnO2 films being in the UV region, significant absorbance is still observed in the visible range of 400–800 nm, especially for DZS–SnO2, possibly indicating a high defect concentration. While the comparative TiO2 nanoparticle sample also showed some extent of visible range absorption (Fig. S2†), which might be due to the diffusive scattering effect. Their optical band gaps can be extracted from the Tauc plot in the Fig. 5b inset with Eg values of about 3.84 eV and 3.33 eV for amorphous ZS nanocubes and DZS–SnO2 nanocrystal assemblies, respectively. It is noted here that the Eg value for DZS–SnO2 is extracted based on the composite absorption spectrum from both DZS and SnO2 nanocrystals for simplification purpose. Meanwhile, broad PL peaks were observed in the visible region without significant UV peaks which could be related to the intrinsic band gap emission for both ZS and DZS–SnO2. Two main PL peaks were identified in the ZS sample, centered around ∼555 nm and ∼615 nm. Even stronger emission bands were revealed corresponding to defect states in DZS–SnO2, as shown in Fig. 5c. These emissions could be caused by oxygen vacancies, Zn interstitials, etc.31,32 Such defect levels in the band structures of ZS and DZS–SnO2 may contribute significantly to their highly efficient visible-light driven photocatalytic performance.
According to traditional photocatalytic theory, the oxidation reaction of the dye is generally believed to be initiated by ˙OH and ˙O2− radicals.3,4,34,35 The formation of ˙O2− and ˙OH can be detected by the electron spin resonance (ESR) and photoluminescence since these two radicals can be captured by either a magnetic field or some fluorescent probe molecules, such as 2-chloro-1,3-dibenzothiazolinecyclohexene36 and 4′,9′-bis(diphenylphosphinyl)naphthofluorescein37 for O2−˙, and terephthalic acid38,39 and coumarin (COU)40,41 for ˙OH.
In this work, the generation of ˙OH on photocatalysts ZS and DZS–SnO2 was investigated by photoluminescence measurements with COU, which is supposed to readily react with ˙OH at the photo-illuminated sample/water interface to produce the highly fluorescent product, 7HC (shown in Fig. 6a) with a PL signal at 456 nm. Fig. 6b–d show the PL spectra evolution from 1 mmol L−1 COU solution under solar simulator illumination as a function of time in the presence of ZS, DZS–SnO2, and TiO2 nanoparticles. There is no signal of 7HC (or ˙OH) before illumination, and then a gradual and proportional augment in the PL intensity at about 456 nm occurred with increasing illumination time. High intensities of the 7HC signal (or ˙OH) were detected after 1 hour in both ZS and DZS–SnO2 suspensions, which were around three times more intense than that in the TiO2 suspension after 1 hour. Fig. 6d shows that the formation rates of ˙OH in the presence of ZS and DZS–SnO2 were almost the same and remained constant while that of ˙OH in the TiO2 system was much lower and largely decreased after 50 min. These results are consistent with their photocatalysis performance under solar light, proving that both ZS and DZS–SnO2 nanoparticles are highly efficient photocatalysts due to the efficient generation of ˙OH. It is worth noting that only a portion of the ˙OHs were detected and the formation rate or the concentration of ˙OH is actually underestimated due to the short lifetime and relatively low diffusion rate of ˙OH, which leads to a low detection efficiency.40

Defects, upon tuned properly, can benefit or hamper the catalytic performance through either trapping carriers/radicals or functioning as active sites. In this work, the populated visible defect energy states have been confirmed to be responsible for their visible-light driven catalytic activities. Considering the tunability of defect states and concentration, controllability of crystallinity, and possible heterojunction induced synergistic effect,6,42–44 the DZS–SnO2 composite has been chosen for further exploration of their photocatalytic behavior. As a control strategy, post-thermal treatment was found to enable further controlled DZS–SnO2 composites with tunable catalytic performance. For example, a much slower ramping rate (2 °C min−1) during thermal annealing was used to compare it with the previously used one (20 °C min−1). The temperature history profiles are illustrated in the ESI (Fig. S3†). The photocatalytic behaviors were then investigated under the same conditions using a solar simulator. Surprisingly, the RB was almost completely decomposed after only 20 minutes, instead of 60 minutes in the fast heating sample mentioned above. The photodegradation efficiency of slow-ramping samples is four times that of the DZS–SnO2 nanoparticles obtained after a fast ramping (20 °C min−1) thermal treatment. The kinetic analysis in the inset of Fig. 7a shows the perfect first order reaction characteristics. The decomposition rate constant was calculated to be ∼0.154 min−1, about 25 times that of TiO2 nanopowders (6.25 × 10−3 min−1) and even better than that of TiO2 under UV illumination (0.150 min−1). Notably, this is an extremely high efficiency under solar-light illumination compared to various reported numbers in the literature.7–9,12,17 Coincidently, the wavelength-dependent efficiency towards RB degradation (Fig. 7b) is also much higher with slow-ramp DZS–SnO2 samples at all wavelengths than that with the fast-ramp treated one.

To reveal and understand the mechanisms for the improved catalytic activity in slow-ramping thermally treated samples, further structural and optical characterizations were carried out including TEM, HRTEM, XRD, PL, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Fig. 8a and b show HRTEM images of these two DZS–SnO2 samples, in which the DZS and SnO2 domains have been marked. Based on this HRTEM data analysis, the crystallite sizes of SnO2 and DZS using the slow-ramp heating are around 10–25 nm and 15–35 nm, respectively. Both components in the fast-ramp composite have much smaller crystallite size, which are around 5–15 nm and 10–20 nm for SnO2 and DZS, respectively. Similar results on the crystallite size have also been obtained from XRD and shown in Fig. S4 and data are summarized in Table S2.† There is no obvious difference in the particle size and the polyhedral or irregular morphologies of these two DZS–SnO2 nanocrystal assemblies. In the heterogeneous catalyst system, larger crystallite sizes can suppress the charge recombination or trapping either at the interface or in the crystal domains of two semiconductor phases.3,30 This could be one of the main reasons for the improved photocatalytic activity in the slow-ramp produced DZS–SnO2.

(f) Schematic models of the coherent atomic arrangements between (011) SnO2 planes and (3 1) DZS planes. Insets in (c and d) are FFT and inverse FFT images, respectively. 
In HRTEM investigations, different phase separation scenarios have been observed involving individual domains and the interfaces of DZS and SnO2. Fig. 8c and d illustrate the phase separation of DZS and SnO2 in slow-ramp DZS–SnO2 composites. DZS and SnO2 domains have been identified and a typical heteroepitaxial interface between DZS and SnO2 was observed. The fast-Fourier transform (FFT) pattern (Fig. 8c, inset) revealed two sets of diffraction patterns corresponding to the spinel cubic DZS [11] zone axis pattern and rutile tetragonal SnO2 [1 1] zone axis pattern. The coherent interface forms between (011)SnO2 and (3 1)DZS, whose interplanar spacings are measured to be 0.270 nm and 0.264 nm from the FFT pattern, with a 2.27% lattice mismatch. As a result, structural defects such as misfit dislocations are formed in either DZS or SnO2 phase domains in order to release the coherent interface stress. In the present case, misfit dislocations were marked by a white triangle arrow in Fig. 8c. It is worth noting that the above epitaxial interfaces are populated in the slow-ramp DZS–SnO2 samples, while there was no lattice alignment observed in the fast-ramp DZS–SnO2 samples. It is known that the charge transport across coherent interfaces with small lattice mismatch is generally more efficient than incoherent interfaces due to the sharper band structure alignment with lower electronic energy barrier height.45–48 Hence, these populated epitaxial interfaces between DZS and SnO2 nanocrystals generated during a slow annealing process could contribute to the enhancement of their photocatalytic activity. It is reasonable that in a slow annealing process, the interface energy can reach the lowest state via an orientation adjustment in a given long period of time, which is however, much harder in a fast ramping process.
The PL spectra collected under variable excitation power densities shown in Fig. 9 were used to investigate the defect states and carrier killer center concentration in DZS–SnO2 fast-ramp and slow-ramp samples. Both crystal DZS–SnO2 samples show strong, defect driven PL emission in the green and red visible light region between 500 nm and 700 nm while with slightly higher luminescence intensity for the slow-ramp crystals under all excitations, indicating a higher concentration of radiative defects. Moreover, the PL of slow-ramp DZS–SnO2 showed more proportional increase with the excitation power density (for the PL emission band at ∼615 nm as well as for the integrated PL, as shown in Fig. 9c) while the fast-ramp sample seems to reveal a more obvious saturation effect of the defect emission with lower PL under 25–28 kW cm−2 excitation. The observed saturation effect in the yellow and red emission region is caused either by the smaller crystallite volume or by a higher number of killer centers in the fast ramp sample. Killer centers would lower the carrier lifetime, thus they might not contribute to photocatalysis. Meanwhile, the PL emission of the slow-ramp sample extends further into the blue spectral region with evolving blue emission bands, while this trend is weaker for the fast-ramp sample. Therefore, we obtain more optically active states over the visible spectral region (∼380–700 nm) for the slow-ramp sample compared to the fast-ramp sample, thus they might contribute to photocatalysis. Therefore, the improved photocatalytic performance is likely caused by superposition of the defect saturation in the fast-ramp sample and the increased number of optically active defect states in the slow-ramp sample.

Our previous work has revealed that the interaction between two semiconductors in a heterogeneous catalyst system is vital for the photocatalytic performance under UV light.42,43 Recently, type II heterojunction photocatalysts were found with improved photocatalytic performance in organic pollutant degradation6,44 and solar water splitting.49,50 Through positive interactions between two semiconductors, the photon-excited electron–hole pair can be separated efficiently, hence having a longer lifetime. The effect of the heterojunction interaction on the photocatalytic performance was investigated here. Firstly, the catalytic activity of the physical mixture of DZS and SnO2 nanoparticles was tested for comparison (Fig. 10a). The as-synthesized DZS and commercial SnO2 were treated at 850 °C annealing with 2 °C min−1 ramping rate before mixing and testing (the synthetic method and material basic characterization are shown in the ESI, Fig. 10b, and S5†). A very low rate constant (3.19 × 10−3 min−1, Table 1) under solar light was obtained from the physical mixture of DZS and SnO2 nanoparticles. XPS analysis was further carried out (Fig. 10c and S5†) to compare the surface binding energy states and interaction between DZS and SnO2. The O 1s and Sn 3d peaks are almost identical for fast- and slow-ramp DZS–SnO2 (Fig. S5 and Table S3†). While, the Zn 2p of DZS–SnO2 slow-ramp showed a similar binding energy to that of the DZS–SnO2 fast-ramp sample, which are located at 1024.9 eV and 1024.7 eV for Zn 2p3/2, respectively. It has been reported that depending on the synthetic method, the Zn 2p3/2 signal of nano-sized Zn2SnO4 is normally located in the range of 1021.9 eV–1024.5 eV.51,52 Our DZS–SnO2 nanocomposites with Zn 2p peaks at even larger binding energies imply that the stronger interaction induced an electron shift between DZS and SnO2. Based on the above characterization results and discussions, the defect states, crystallite size, interface coherency, and heterojunction induced phase interactions are the main reasons for the excellent photocatalytic performance demonstrated in the DZS–SnO2 slow-ramp samples.

4. Conclusion
ZnSnO3 mesoporous nanocubes and Zn2SnO4–SnO2 nanoparticles have been achieved by utilizing thermal engineering of zinc hydroxystannate nanocubes. Both of these large band gap (Eg > 3.1 eV) photocatalysts which possess radiative defect states in the broad visible region showed much better performance under solar simulator illumination than under UV light (310–400 nm) towards dye degradation. It implies that defect tuning can be as effective as band gap tuning towards utilizing solar energy. For the first time, zinc-based stannate nanostructures are reported as efficient visible-light driven photocatalysts. The monochromatic light analysis and optical property investigations indicate that the relatively high activity of ZnSnO3 and DZS–SnO2 composites in the visible wavelength range was due to populated defect state induced transitions in the visible range. The DZS–SnO2 nanocomposites' photocatalytic activity was dramatically affected by the annealing conditions. By decreasing the heating rate from 20 to 2 °C min−1, DZS–SnO2 composites with much more radiative defect energy levels and larger crystallite size were obtained and revealed a much higher activity under solar light illumination. Moreover, the populated epitaxial interfaces and strong heterojunction interactions between spinel DZS and rutile SnO2 nano-grains were found during the slow phase separation and annealing process. In all, the larger grain size, more active defect levels, epitaxial phase separation, and the strong interaction between DZS and SnO2 in slow-ramp DZS–SnO2 are considered to be the main reasons for its much higher photocatalytic activity than the fast-ramp one under solar light illumination. These hetero-phase nanoparticle assemblies could be extended as promising catalysts for the efficient visible-light-driven fuel production and treatment of air pollution and waste water sources.
