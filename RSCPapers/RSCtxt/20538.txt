    , Accepted 4th September 2019First published on 16th September 2019AbstractOver the past few decades, most of the work on electrochemical charge storage devices has been focused on the development of positive electrodes in the field of supercapacitors. Besides, the development of negative electrodes is very rare and also they deliver poor specific capacitance and hence more attention should be paid to the development of the same. The present study deals with the fabrication of a battery-type asymmetric supercapacitor (α-LiFe5O8//NiO) and examination of its electrochemical performance. Herein, a facile and cost-effective route was adopted to prepare α-LiFe5O8 nanorods and they demonstrate battery-type Faradaic behaviour with a Fe3 ↔ Fe0 quasi-conversion reaction in a negative potential window. In a three electrode cell, they exhibit a specific capacity of 999 C g−1 at 2 A g−1. Similarly, the nanoflakes of NiO electrodes exhibit Faradaic behaviour in a positive potential window, which results in an excellent specific capacity of 477 C g−1 at a specific current of 2 A g−1. The fabricated asymmetric supercapacitor device indicates a Faradaic nature of the energy storage process and it provides a specific capacity of 134 C g−1 at a specific current of 4 A g−1. Moreover, the asymmetric cell delivers a specific energy of 30 W h kg−1 at a specific power of 621 W kg−1. These appreciable features of the asymmetric supercapacitor are explained on the basis of the synergy between NiO and α-LiFe5O8.
1. Introduction
In recent times, the development of electric vehicles (EVs) has received a great deal of attention in the automobile industry due to their merits like noise-free operation, zero-greenhouse gas emission and fuel-economy when compared to internal combustion engines (ICEs).1–3 EVs are powered by energy storage devices such as batteries. However, EVs produce a large amount of energy during regenerative braking. This results in production of a large amount of energy in a short duration. To store this energy we need devices that can be charged and discharged in a short span of time.4 This can be resolved by hybridizing the batteries with high power devices. Supercapacitors (SCs) are known as high power electrochemical energy storage devices with the ability to charge/discharge quickly and longer lifespan.5–7 Moreover, their high cyclic stability and safety have propelled their growth in storing energy produced by renewable resources.6 More recently, Zheng et al. have reported the fabrication of bias-free, solar-charged pseudocapacitors using a 3D ZnO@NiO hybrid structure for conversion and storage of solar energy.8
Though SCs demonstrate higher specific power, the specific energy of SCs is still below the specific energy of batteries. Great efforts are being made by the scientific community to improve the specific energy of SCs. Effective and common strategies to improve the energy density of a SC cell are: (a) extending the potential window and (b) increasing the capacity via battery-type positive and negative electrode materials which have been used to fabricate SCs.9,10 The potential window as well as the capacity of SCs can be increased by utilization of suitable battery-type positive (NiO, Co3O4) and negative (V2O5, MoO3 and iron oxide based nanostructures) electrodes. This kind of SCs are termed as battery-type asymmetric supercapacitors (BASCs) and they store energy via an ion intercalation mechanism and/or quasi-conversion reaction mechanism, owing to the surface active sites of the electrode materials and hydrated ions of the electrolyte.11
Nowadays, iron oxide based materials are developed and examined as potential Nernstian negative electrodes for numerous futuristic supercapacitor applications due to their favourable physicochemical properties, multiple valence states (Fe0, Fe2+ and Fe3+), excellent redox behaviour, high chemical stability, wide operating windows, non-toxicity, abundance and high theoretical capacity.12 Especially, inverse spinel crystal structured ferric oxide based nanomaterials have emerged as promising candidates for designing the negative electrode of asymmetric and/or hybrid supercapacitors. Among them, lithium ferrite nanostructures with different polymorphic phases (LiFeO2 and LiFe5O8) are utilized to a larger extent in lithium ion batteries (LIBs).13–15 LiFe5O8 (LFO) is one of the typical inverse spinel type iron oxide based materials, displaying advantageous features such as a cost-effective and environment friendly nature. It is endowed with enriched oxidation states. It is further subdivided into ordered (α phase with space group P4132/P4332) and disordered (β phase with space group Fdm) LiFe5O8.16 These characteristic features project it as a prospective negative electrode material for the fabrication of BASCs.
Similarly, nanostructured battery-type electrodes like layered NiO have attracted large attention as positive electrodes of BASCs due to their high theoretical specific capacity (1291.4 C g−1@0.44 V), high porosity, well-defined redox activity, cyclic stability, easy availability and cost-effectiveness, and hence them being a better replacement for costly pseudocapacitive RuO2 and IrO2.17–20 The charge storage process in NiO electrodes, in basic electrolytes, originates from the transfer of localized electrons which govern the active reversible redox couple of Ni2+/Ni3+.17 In general, the electrochemical behaviour of NiO electrodes is highly dominated by their morphological features. Numerous attempts have been made to enrich the electrochemical properties by tailoring multifunctional nanostructures.21–29 Among them, flake-like nanostructures effectively act as firm pathways for enhanced specific surface area. This leads to a reduction in the ion diffusion path-length and lowering of the charge-transfer resistance for better intercalation of electrolyte ions into the electrode materials.17
The present work highlights the fabrication and characterization of lithium iron oxide nanostructures towards their use as negative electrodes of BASCs. A quasi-conversion reaction based charge storage process is observed for the nanorods of α-LiFe5O8 electrodes, indicating battery-type behaviour. A battery-type asymmetric supercapacitor cell (NiO//α-LiFe5O8) was fabricated and its electrochemical performance was tested. Remarkably, the multi-level porous α-LiFe5O8 exhibited a relatively high capacity and excellent cycle life, demonstrating its potential as an electrode material for supercapacitor applications.
2. Experimental techniques
2.1. Synthesis of lithium ferrite nanostructures
Lithium ferrite nanoparticles have been prepared through a cost effective solution based precipitation route. Lithium nitrate (0.62055 g) was dissolved in 180 ml of double distilled water. Subsequently, ferric nitrate nanohydrate (7.272 g) was dissolved in the same. The mixture was stirred continuously in order to obtain a homogeneous solution. Besides, 10 w/v% of structure directing agent was prepared by dissolving 2 g of polyethylene glycol in 20 ml of double distilled water and this was slowly added to the precursor solution. The pH of the solution was adjusted to 10 by dropwise addition of 1 M NaOH aqueous solution. The blended solutions were continuously stirred at room temperature for 3 hours, resulting in the formation of brown precipitates. The obtained precipitate was washed thoroughly with double distilled water 7 times to remove the excess OH− and dried at 80 °C for 24 hours. Further, the prepared particles were annealed at 600 °C for 3 hours and named LFO.
2.2. Preparation of NiO nanostructures
Nickel hydroxide was taken as the starting material for the synthesis of nickel oxide. Initially, nickel hydroxide was prepared via a simple microwave synthesis route. The typical synthesis of nickel hydroxide is as follows: 2.908 g of nickel nitrate hexahydrate (precursor material) and an appropriate amount (6.006 g) of urea (reducing agent) were dissolved in 200 ml of double distilled water. 0.2803 g of L-arginine was dissolved in the precursor solution as a bio-compatible surfactant. The mixture was continuously stirred to obtain a homogeneous solution. The transparent solution was taken in a 250 ml Pyrex bottle with a polypropylene cap. The solution in the Pyrex bottle was subjected to 400 W microwave irradiation for 12 minutes. A household microwave oven operating at 2.45 GHz was employed as the microwave source. Here, the microwave energy induced the kinetics of the reaction that leads to coordinating the nickel ions with hydroxyl ions of urea and arginine resulting in the formation of a light green precipitate. Further, the solution containing the green precipitate was washed five times with double distilled water followed by drying at 80 °C for 24 hours. The as-prepared particles were annealed at 350 °C for 1 hour in an air atmosphere. The following equations indicate the formation of interconnected sheets of α-Ni(OH)2 and NiO nanoflakes and its pictorial representation is displayed in Scheme 1. (1) (2)

2.3. Characterization technique
Thermogravimetric analysis was performed on nickel hydroxide nanostructures using an Exstar 6000, in air, from room temperature to 800 °C at a scan rate of 10 °C. The functional groups of the prepared materials were identified through FTIR measurements made using a JASCO FTIR 460 plus spectrometer in a range of 400–4000 cm−1 (KBr pellet method). The crystal phase and structure of the prepared materials were analyzed using XRD (Rigaku Miniflux 600 X-ray diffractometer, CuKα radiation, λ = 0.1542 nm, 40 kV, 15 mA). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was employed to diagnose the elemental composition and valence states of lithium ferrite nanoparticles (ESCALAB Xi+ spectrometer). A scanning electron microscope (VEGA3, TESCAN (Czech Republic), 30 kV) and transmission electron microscope (JEOL/JEM 2100, LaB6 source, 200 kV) were employed to investigate the morphology of nickel oxide and lithium iron oxide. N2 adsorption and desorption (Nova Station 0, Quantachrome Instruments, version 3.0) was performed on the prepared materials in order to examine the specific surface area (Brunauer–Emmett–Teller equation) and porosity (Barrett–Joyner–Halenda method).
2.4. Electrode preparation and electrochemical studies
The supercapacitive properties of the nickel oxide and lithium iron oxide electrodes were individually tested using a three electrode electrochemical cell (Electrochemical Workstation, CHI 660D). The fabrication of the electroactive material to be employed as the working electrode has been reported elsewhere.30 In a typical experiment, a Ag/AgCl electrode and platinum wire were used as reference and counter electrodes respectively. Electroanalytical techniques like cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostic charge–discharge (GCD) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were performed in 6 M KOH solutions. The following equation was used to estimate the specific capacity of the prepared materials from the GCD technique31,32 (3)where, CS, specific capacity (C g−1); I, specific current (A g−1) and , area (excluding the discharge area of bare Ni foam) of the discharge curve (V s); S = mel (mass of the active material loaded) (g) or A, area of the active material coated (cm−2); and V, potential window (V).
2.5. Assembly of NiO//α-LiFe5O8 asymmetric supercapacitor cells
Sandwich structured battery-type asymmetric supercapacitor cells were fabricated with the aid of nickel oxide nanoflakes as the positive electrode, lithium iron oxide nanorods as the negative electrode, and polyurethane foam and 6 M KOH as the separator and electrolyte respectively. Balancing the positive and negative charges produced at the surface of the nickel oxide and lithium iron oxide electrodes respectively is a crucial factor to obtain outstanding electrochemical performance, and it can be achieved by mass balance theory (eqn (4)):33,34 (4)where, m+ and m−, masses (g); C+ and C−, specific capacity (C g−1); and ΔV+ and ΔV−, potential window of the positive and negative electrode materials respectively. Then, the specific energy and specific power were estimated using the following equations, respectively:30 (5) (6)where, ES – specific energy (W h kg−1); I – applied current (A);  – area (excluding the discharge area of bare Ni foam) under the discharge curve (V s); mele – mass of active material loaded (g); PS – specific power (W kg−1) and t – discharge time (s).
3. Result and discussion
3.1. Characterization of lithium iron oxide nanostructures

3.1.1. Structural, morphological and textural analysis. 
The crystal phase and structure of the prepared lithium ferrite nanoparticles are diagnosed by XRD as shown in Fig. 1a. The diffraction peaks located at 20.51°, 24.54°, 30.28°, 35.65°, 43.41°, 53.92°, 57.43°, 63.06° and 74.80° agree well with the planes of (111), (220), (311), (400), (422), (511), (440), (620) and (533), which is consistent with cubic α-LiFe5O8 (JCPDS card No. 74-1726). Obviously, the XRD pattern of the prepared material reveals a high degree of phase purity with the absence of other diffraction peaks of α-Fe2O3 and α-LiFeO2 and so on. Further, the surface elemental composition and chemical valances of lithium ferrites have been studied using the energy dispersive X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy spectrum (Fig. 1b–e). The full survey spectrum in Fig. 1(b) indicates the presence of Li, Fe and O element in the lithium ferrite nanostructures. Fig. 1c shows the high resolution XPS spectrum of Li 1s element, which can be resolved into two components: the binding energy at 53.7 eV can be assigned to Li 1s while the XPS peak located at 55 eV corresponds to Fe 3p.35 The high resolution Fe 2p spectra are displayed in Fig. 1d indicating two spin–orbit doublets of Fe 2p3/2 and Fe 2p1/2 at binding energies of 709 eV and 722.5 eV respectively with a spin orbit splitting of 13.6 eV.36 Besides, two corresponding satellites are observed at 717.2 and 731.7 eV respectively due to the shake-up process, confirming the presence of mixed oxidation states of Fe3+ and Fe2+.37,38 Thus, Fe 2p3/2 and Fe 2p1/2 are individually deconvoluted into two peaks assigned to the Fe2+ (708.6 and 722.3 eV) and Fe3+ (710.3 and 724.3 eV) states in the α-LiFe5O8 nanostructures.39 The high resolution XPS spectrum of iron has shown multiple valances in the lithium ferrite nanostructures, which may be a crucial factor in enhancing the electrochemical performance. As shown in Fig. 1e, the O 1s spectrum can be fitted into three peaks: the component O1 centered at a lower binding energy of 528.4 eV is attributed to octahedral O–(Fe/Li) coordination, the signal from oxygen vacancies is observed as the component O2 located at a medium binding energy of 529.3 eV and the higher binding energy component O3 at 530.7 eV corresponds to O–Li tetrahedral coordination.35

The morphological features of the α-LiFe5O8 nanostructures are identified using TEM (Fig. 2a–c), indicating the formation of rod-like structures. The nanorods thus formed in the aqueous precipitation route are free from aggregation. The same is attributed to the effect of polyethylene glycol. This aggregation free-state can provide a viable pathway for electrolyte ions, signifying better electrochemical performance. Moreover, the surface of the nanorods is endowed with a large quantity of pores with different sizes and this can be clearly seen in the TEM image (Fig. 2b). The formation of such mesoporous nanorods is advantageous in the electrochemical analysis when compared to bare rods. The electrolyte ions could easily intercalate into inner active sites through the pores which are available in the surface of the nanorods and hence the electrochemical performance can be enhanced.

The HRTEM image in Fig. 2d shows well resolved lattice fringes indicating the high crystallinity of α-LiFe5O8, which is consistent with the XRD analysis. The lattice spacing of 0.33 nm matches well with the (220) plane of cubic α-LiFe5O8. The porous structure can offer large specific surface area, which results in better electrochemical performance. Thus, BET measurements are carried out on the α-LiFe5O8 nanorods to identify the magnitude of the specific surface area, pore size and pore volume. Fig. 2e shows the N2 adsorption and desorption isotherms of the α-LiFe5O8 nanorods. It shows a Langmuir type IV isotherm with a typical H3 hysteresis loop around the high pressure region of 0.45 to 1.0 P/P0, indicating the presence of mesopores.30 A specific surface area of 20.8 m2 g−1 is estimated from the BET curve (the inset of Fig. 2e). The overall distributions of pores against their sizes are studied through the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method (Fig. 2f). The profile of the pore size distribution curve comprises different sizes of pores at values of 1.77 (37.48%), 2.57 (26.38%), 3.33 (20.83%) and 3.97 nm (15.29%). Here, the pore diameter of 1.77 nm constitutes a major contribution of 37.48% within the lithium ferrite nanostructures, indicating the presence of micropores. Moreover, a pore volume of 0.052 cm3 g−1 is obtained from these measurements.


3.1.2. Mechanism for the formation of nano-rods. 
Raw materials lithium nitrate (LiNO3, Sigma, 98%), ferric nitrate nanohydrate (Fe(NO3)3 9H2O, Central Drug House Ltd, 99%), polyethylene glycol (M. W. 8000, Sigma) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH, Central Drug House Ltd, 98%) were used as received without any further purification. A facile and low cost precipitation route was employed to synthesize the lithium ferrite nanostructures. The main advantage of this facile method is that it permits control of the nucleation and growth rate of nanoparticles. The formation of lithium ferrite nanorods could be explained in three steps: precipitate formation (nucleation and growth process), consecutive washing and annealing. At the initial stage, by dissolving metallic salts, the Li+ and Fe3+ ions were released into the mixture of double distilled water and 10 w/v% of polyethylene glycol. On the addition of NaOH aqueous solution, the pH was adjusted to 10. In this supersaturated solution, the precipitate was formed by coordinating the Li+ and Fe3+ ions with OH− ions. The precipitate thus formed was further washed and annealed at 600 °C. The plausible reactions of metallic salts upon contact with water are given in reaction 1 to 4.40 (7) Fe3+ + 3OH− → Fe(OH)3(8) (9) 5Fe(OH)3 + Li+ + OH− → α-LiFe5O8 + 8H2O(10)
Herein, the polyethylene glycol plays a crucial role in the development of nano-rods of lithium ferrites. It acts as a binder to inhibit the particles from aggregating, providing favourable active sites for growing the nanoparticles along a particulate direction (the growth rate is promoted along one direction by controlling other facets). Polyethylene glycol has a lower dielectric constant (ε = 37)41 and hence it increases the electrostatic attraction between metallic ions and hydroxyl ions according to Coulomb's law and has a greater tendency to form rod-like structures. Based on the above results, we speculate that the α-LiFe5O8 nano-rods could be prepared under the action of polyethylene glycol through a precipitation route. The formation mechanism of the nanorods is presented in Scheme 1.


3.1.3. Supercapacitive behaviour of the α-LiFe5O8 nanorods – three electrode mode. 
To diagnose the practical utility of lithium iron oxide as negative electrodes of BASCs, a three electrode electrochemical cell is employed in a negative potential window ranging from −1 to 0 V (vs. Ag/AgCl). Fig. 3a shows the pictorial representation of intercalation and deintercalation mechanisms during the redox reaction. The mesopores anchored on the surface of the α-LiFe5O8 nanorods act as a viable pathway for the transportation of electrolyte ions. Cyclic voltammetry measurements are carried out for different ramp rates. Fig. 3b displays the CV curve of the LFO electrode, which describes a strong deviation from the ideal rectangular shape, indicating that the energy storage process is mainly accomplished by a Nernstian reaction.42–44 The redox mechanism of the α-LiFe5O8 electrode can be explained based on the redox reactions of iron oxides. All the CV curves display two pair of redox peaks at −890/−865 mV and −158/−370 mV (Fig. 3b). Briefly, the anodic peak located at −890 mV corresponds to the oxidation of Fe0 to Fe2+ (formation of Fe(OH)2) and the peak found at −158 mV indicates the oxidation of Fe2+ to Fe3+ (Fe(OH)2 to FeOOH). In the reverse scan, the α-LiFe5O8 electrode demonstrates two cathodic peaks at −370 and −865 mV and this can be attributed to the reduction of Fe3+ to Fe2+ (FeOOH to Fe(OH)2) followed by Fe2+ to Fe0 (Fe(OH)2 to Fe) respectively.45 In addition, metallic Fe could be directly oxidized to Fe3+ during the anodic dissolution, implying a quasi-conversion reaction. Moreover, the voltammogram of the LFO electrode retains its shape with increasing the ramp rate, reflecting that the nanorods of lithium ferrite have good rate performance and a high degree of mass transportation. Apparently, the LFO electrode demonstrates a larger potential difference between anodic and cathodic peaks, which indicates the kinetic irreversibility of the redox process. The battery-type Faradaic activity of the LFO electrode material can be further identified by the power law: iP = aνb, where, iP, peak current (A g−1); a and b, constants and ν, ramp rate (mV s−1), demonstrating the linear characteristic behaviour between the peak current and ramp rate: logIP = 0.62 + 0.55 × logν (Fig. 3c).46 The ‘b’ value can be obtained from the slope of the straight line and it can be either 0.5 (diffusion-controlled reaction) or 1 (surface-controlled reaction).47 In this study, the slope of the linear behaviour is nearer to 0.5 signifying that charges are stored as a result of mass diffusion of electrolyte ions.

Furthermore, galvanostic charge discharge tests are conducted for various specific currents like 2, 5, 10 and 20 A g−1 in the potential range from −1 to 0 V. The GCD curves in Fig. 3d show non-linear charging/discharging characteristics, manifesting that the storage of charge is mainly related to a Faradaic redox reaction. Interestingly, the nanorods of lithium ferrite electrodes demonstrate a sudden potential variation in the discharge curves, signifying that the charge storage process is also directed by a quasi-conversion reaction between Fe3+ and Fe0.11 In supercapacitors, the storage of electrical energy can be explained based on two different mechanisms and they are “electrical double layer” and “pseudocapacitive behaviour”. Conway proposed several theories to explain the pseudocapacitive nature of the energy storage behaviour: “underpotential deposition, redox pseudocapacitance and intercalation pseudocapacitance”.48 In our work, the prepared α-LiFe5O8 electrodes demonstrate none of the above mechanisms for the storage of energy. Recently, Lou et al.11 explained the electrochemical performance of Bi2O3 electrodes based on a distinct “quasi-conversion reaction (Bi0 ↔ Bi3+)” mechanism that completely differs from the usual “intercalation” mechanism. The same type of charge discharge characteristics are encountered for the α-LiFe5O8 electrodes and hence the redox behaviour can be explained based on the combination of a Faradaic reaction (Fe2+ ↔ Fe3+) and a quasi-conversion reaction mechanism (Fe0 ↔ Fe3+). More recently, the quasi-conversion reaction based charge–discharge performance was reported by Nagamuthu et al. for Ag/NiO nanoparticles.49 Moreover, the Faraday efficiency50–52 is estimated using the area of the charging and discharging curves and it is 40.5, 43.1, 49.4 and 52% for specific currents of 2, 5, 10 and 20 A g−1 respectively, indicating the irreversibility of the Nernstian process. The specific (areal) capacity of the lithium ferrite electrodes is estimated using relation (3) and is 999 (1498.5 mC cm−2), 758 (1137 mC cm−2), 557 (835.5 mC cm−2) and 221 (331.5 mC cm−2) C g−1 for a specific current of 2, 5, 10 and 20 A g−1 respectively. The reduction in capacity with increasing the specific current (Fig. 3e) can be explained on the basis of insufficient time available for dumping of charges on to the electrode. The capacity of the nanorods of lithium ferrite is superior to the reported values (Fig. 3f) for iron based nanostructures (Table 1).53–61

The outstanding electrochemical behaviour of the α-LiFe5O8 electrodes can be credited to (1) the presence of multiple valances, which enhances the electrochemical performance via a quasi-conversion reaction mechanism (Fe0 ↔ Fe3+), (2) the formation of nanorods, which provide firm pathways for efficient transport of ions in the Faradaic activity of Fe2+ ↔ Fe3+, and (3) the multilevel porous surface texture that can accommodate large volume changes in redox reactions.

Fig. 3g displays the Nyquist plot (Z′ vs. −Z′′) of the α-LiFe5O8 electrode. The impedance related to the quasi-conversion reaction upon the diffusion of electrolyte ions at the interface between the electrode and electrolyte is studied using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy within the frequency range of 10 mHz to 100 kHz. The obtained impedance spectrum is fitted to a modified Randle's circuit.62 Obviously, the Nyquist plot of the LFO electrode displays a quasi-semicircle (high frequency region), semicircle (middle frequency region) and straight line (low frequency region). The semicircles in the high and middle frequency regions are attributed to the combination of equivalent series resistance and charge transfer resistance. The interception of the quasi-semicircle at the real axis (Z′) reflects the equivalent series resistance, which includes the electrolyte solution resistance, inherent resistance of the LFO electrodes and contact resistance at the interface. Moreover, the diameter of the quasi-semicircle observed in the high frequency region provides the charge transfer resistance produced from the Faradaic reaction at the interface. The RS (1 Ω) and RCT (12 Ω) values can be obtained from the x intercept of the first semi-circle and its diameter in the high frequency region respectively. The straight line observed in the low frequency region (Warburg domain) makes an angle of 45° with the real axis. This Warburg line is mainly ascribed to the frequency dependent diffusion of OH− ions onto the α-LiFe5O8 matrix. This transport of charge carriers via diffusion, under ac-probing, was initially proposed by Warburg and later developed by Randles. Mathematically, the Faradaic impedance can be expressed as a combination of charge transfer controlled and diffusion controlled processes (ZF(ω) = RCT + ZW(ω)). When ω → ∞, the electrochemical performance is dominated by a charge transfer controlled process and it corresponds to the quasi-semicircle in the high frequency region. Whereas, the diffusion controlled electrochemical behaviour can be seen when ω → 0. The semi-infinite Warburg behaviour with a diffusion layer having infinite thickness can be expressed as,  or ; where, σ is the Warburg coefficient, j is an imaginary unit, ω stands for angular frequency (rad s−1) and α corresponds to the transfer coefficient, which can be obtained from the slope of the linear plot between log|Z′′| and log(1/ω) and indicates the nature of the electrochemical performance of the electrode materials (α takes 0.5 for Warburg behaviour).63Fig. 3h shows a characteristic linear behaviour between log|Z′′| and log(1/ω). Interestingly, a transfer coefficient (α) of 0.47 (it is close to 0.5) and Warburg coefficient of 32.67 are obtained from the slope and intercept of the straight line, reflecting Warburg behaviour. This fruitful information additionally supports the result gathered from the cyclic voltammetry technique (i.e. a diffusion controlled process). Moreover, the potassium ion diffusion coefficient is estimated using relation (11):64 (11)where, R, gas constant (8.314 J mol−1 K−1); T, temperature (295 K); A, surface area (1 cm2); n, number of electrons transferred (6); F, Faraday constant (96485 C mol−1); C, molar concentration of K+ ions (6 × 10−3 mol cm−3) and σ, Warburg coefficient (32.67). The estimated diffusion coefficient is 6.96 × 10−16 cm2 s−1.
Furthermore, the cycle life of the α-LiFe5O8 electrode, upon 5000 continuous charge discharge cycles, is studied using the galvanostic charge discharge method at a specific current of 5 A g−1. Fig. 3i displays the result of the long term cyclic stability test. The Coulombic efficiency and capacity retention are studied in the cycle life test.30 The nanorods of the α-LiFe5O8 electrode reflect an average Coulombic efficiency of 85.3% up to 5000 charge discharge cycles. Accordingly, the capacity retention is also examined for intervals of 200 charge discharge cycles. Initially, the lithium ferrite nanorods displayed 78.8% of their maximum capacity value. The capacity of the material is gradually increased to 100% at the 1600th cycle. The trend of increasing capacity is attributed to an activation process that drives pore opening in consecutive charge discharge cycles, which leads to an enhanced intercalation/de-intercalation rate for the OH− ions. The α-LiFe5O8 electrode maintains 100% capacity up to the 2800th cycle. Herein, the 1D nanostructures display 100% capacity for 1200 continuous charge discharge cycles. After that, the specific capacity gradually decreases and retains 94.8% of its maximum value even at the end of 5000 charge discharge cycles. This significant electrochemical performance is mainly ascribed to the formation of nanorods along with the micro-pore texture.

3.2. Characterization of nickel oxide nanostructures
Nickel oxide was prepared by annealing the pre-synthesized nickel hydroxide, via a facile and rapid microwave route. Thermal analysis has been performed to identify the complete decomposition of nickel hydroxide into nickel oxide and the results are discussed in Section S1 of the ESI.† TGA reveals the possible decomposition and phase change of the as prepared nickel hydroxide nanoparticles (Fig. S1b, ESI†). An abrupt mass loss around 350 °C is observed, suggesting the complete conversion of nickel hydroxide to nickel oxide. Thus, the as-prepared nickel hydroxide nanostructures were annealed at 350 °C to obtain nickel oxide. The XRD pattern of the NiO sample is shown in Fig. 4a. The 2θ values at 36.9°, 43.1°, 62.5°, 75.8° and 79.1° correspond to the (111), (200), (220), (311) and (222) planes respectively of cubic NiO (JCPDS: 89-7130) with a lattice parameter of 4.194 Å.25 No peaks related to α-Ni(OH)2 0.75H2O are noticed in the XRD patterns, signaling its complete conversion to NiO. The crystallite size (D) of the NiO nanoparticles is estimated using Debye–Scherrer's relation.30 The estimated crystallite size for NiO prepared at 350 °C is 3.4 ± 0.52 nm. Chatterjee et al.65 reported a crystallite size of 20.9 nm for NiO nanoparticles prepared via a sol–gel method. It is worth mentioning that the small crystallite size obtained in the present work through microwave synthesis is mainly ascribed to the action of arginine and instantaneous local heating provided by the exposure to microwaves.

As mentioned above, NiO involves a redox reaction to store charges, which depends on the surface architecture and textural properties of nickel oxide. The surface architectures of NiO samples can be examined through SEM and their results are demonstrated in Fig. 4b. The NiO sample displays a network-like structure along with voids resulting from the interwoven two dimensional (2D) nanoflakes. 2D nanoflakes can be considered as “subunits” or “building blocks” of the porous network. The formation of nanoflakes is further confirmed by TEM and discussion is given below. The voids observed in the NiO sample may act as channels for the Faradaic activity during the electrochemical reactions. The flaky networks are further analyzed in depth via TEM and the images are displayed in Fig. 4c. At a higher magnification of 100 nm, the dark lines can be matched to edges that are formed by the interwoven nanoflakes, demonstrating the formation of network-like structures.
In addition, no aggregation of flakes could be seen in Fig. 4c, facilitating the easy accessibility of ions. Moreover, textural properties like the pore size and its distribution have been diagnosed with the aid of N2 adsorption desorption isotherms (BET studies) and their analysis is discussed in the ESI,† S2. The specific surface area of NiO is estimated to be 34.9 m2 g−1. In addition, the pore size distribution within the NiO specimen is estimated using the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method (Fig. S2, ESI†). The obtained pore diameter and pore volume are 15.4 nm and 0.058 cc g−1 respectively. According to the IUPAC classification of pores, the nature of the pores anchored in the NiO specimen is mesopores.30
The supercapacitive behaviours of the prepared NiO electrodes are diagnosed through cyclic voltammetry, galvanostic charge–discharge tests and a. c. impedance analysis. The CV measurements are conducted for various ramp rates ranging from 2 to 25 mV s−1 within a potential window of 0 to 0.45 V. Fig. 4d shows the CV curves of NiO electrodes, demonstrating a pair of Faradaic peaks. The redox performance thus obtained in CV indicates that the mechanism of the NiO electrodes is distinct from a double layer charging process (rectangular shaped CV) and this can be related to a battery-type Faradaic process (peak shaped CV). Herein, the anodic peak results from the oxidation of NiO to NiOOH corresponding to the intercalation of OH− ions and the cathodic peak thus obtained by reduction of NiOOH to NiO corresponds to the deintercalation of OH− ions from the NiO matrix and the possible redox reaction can be explained as NiO + OH− ↔ NiOOH + e−.66 Interestingly, a higher redox current density and greater redox potential separation of the NiO electrodes are observed at a faster ramp rate of 25 mV s−1. The linear response between the ramp rate and peak current (Fig. S3, ESI†) indicates that the redox reaction of the battery-type NiO electrode is controlled by the ionic diffusion process.30
To get more detail regarding the electrochemical performance of the NiO electrodes prepared at a 350 °C annealing temperature, a galvanostic charge–discharge test has been carried out within a potential window of −0.05 V to 0.4 V. The GCD measurements are conducted at different specific currents ranging from 2 to 40 A g−1. The constant current charge/discharge curves in Fig. 4e demonstrate a certain voltage plateau, indicating that the charging/discharging process of the prepared NiO electrodes is attributed to a typical non-capacitive Faradaic process, and this is consistent with a battery-type electrode. Moreover, a Faraday efficiency of 71.9, 79.9, 88.4, 90.7 and 92.5% is estimated through the area of charging and discharging curves studied at a specific current of 2, 5, 10, 20 and 40 A g−1 respectively. The specific capacity is estimated for different specific currents using the discharging area (relation (3)). Fig. 4f displays the variation of the specific capacity upon increasing the specific current. The estimated specific capacity is 477 (715.5 mC cm−2), 364 (546 mC cm−2), 283 (424.5 mC cm−2), 208 (312 mC cm−2) and 152 (228 mC cm−2) C g−1 for a specific current of 2, 5, 10, 20 and 40 A g−1 respectively, signifying much better capacity than the previously reported NiO nanostructures (Table 2).67–73

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy is another suitable electrochemical tool to identify the impedance associated with the redox mechanism. The electrochemical impedance characteristics are studied in the frequency range of 10 mHz to 100 kHz at an amplitude of 5 mV and the analysis is discussed in the ESI,† S5. Fig. S4a (ESI†) displays the Nyquist plot (fitted to a Randle's circuit)30 of the NiO electrode. In the high frequency region of the Nyquist plot, the EIS spectrum of the NiO electrode intercepts at 1.8 Ω of the real part corresponding to the solution resistance and the diameter of the semi-circle represents a charge transfer resistance of 3.2 Ω. From the EIS analysis, the NiO electrode demonstrates low charge transfer resistance, ensuring rapid charge storage. Besides, the NiO electrode shows a diagonal line with 45° inclination in the low frequency region, indicating semi-infinite Warburg behaviour (mass transportation of electrolyte ions). This diffusion controlled energy storage process can be further confirmed from the slope (α = 0.49) of the linear behaviour between log|Z′′| and log(1/ω) (Fig. S4b, ESI†). Similarly, a Warburg coefficient (σ) of 18.62 is obtained from the intercept of the straight line. The hydroxyl ion diffusion coefficient is estimated using relation (11) for the NiO electrode and is 2.78 × 10−12 cm2 s−1. Further, the NiO electrode is subjected to 5000 continuous charge discharge cycles at a specific current of 10 A g−1 to analyze its cyclic stability and its characteristic behaviour is displayed in Fig. S4c (ESI†). The NiO electrode retains 81.2% of its initial capacity value at the end of 5000 continuous charge discharge cycles.
Overall, the prepared mesoporous NiO nanostructures display a fine capacity and excellent rate performance in supercapacitive studies attributed to the mesoporous structure along with 2D nanoflakes. It is worth mentioning that the superior electrochemical performance of the NiO electrode can significantly be ascribed to the following factors: (i) the smaller crystallite size of the NiO nanostructures may increase the electrochemical performance by shortening the distance of ion diffusion, (ii) the 3D array-like structure can improve the degree of intercalation of electrolyte ions into the inner active sites of the NiO matrix, and (iii) the mesoporous structure can provide more active sites, and thus increase the contact area at the electrode/electrolyte interface, facilitating the excellent accessibility of electrolyte ions for high rate performance.
3.3. Electrochemical behaviour of a NiO//α-LiFe5O8 asymmetric supercapacitor

3.3.1. Mass-balance theory. 
Further, to demonstrate the practical utility of the prepared electrodes, a single battery-type asymmetric supercapacitor is fabricated by adopting the nanorods of α-LiFe5O8 as the negative electrode and NiO nanoflakes as the positive electrode. The mass ratio of the NiO electrode to the α-LiFe5O8 electrode is estimated based on mass balance theory (conservation of electric charges). Fig. 5a demonstrates the GCD curves of NiO (−0.05 to 0.4 V) and α-LiFe5O8 (−1 to 0 V) studied at 10 A g−1 in a three electrode cell. The GCD curves of NiO along the positive side and α-LiFe5O8 along the negative side obviously demonstrate a peak shaped redox mechanism, indicating Nernstian-based charge storage phenomena. The mass ratio can be estimated by adopting the specific capacity 283 C g−1 (NiO) and 557 C g−1 (α-LiFe5O8) at a specific current of 10 A g−1 in eqn (4) and it is 1.97, i.e. m+ = m− × 1.97. The total mass (m+ + m−) of the active material used for assembly is 4.5 mg. Fig. 5b displays the CV curves of the asymmetric cell (studied at 50 mV s−1) at different operating voltages. Upon increasing the operating potential from 1.2 to 1.8 V, the enclosed area under the CV curve has increased. The CV curve of ASCs recorded for 1.8 V shows oxygen evolution at the higher potential region. Moreover, the CV curve recorded within 1.6 V displays no obvious oxygen evolution and hence it is selected as an appropriate and stable potential window for evaluating the electrochemical behaviour of ASCs.

3.3.2. Supercapacitive behaviour of a two electrode system. 
The supercapacitive features of the fabricated asymmetric supercapacitor are displayed in Fig. 5(c–i). The voltammograms (Fig. 5c) of the cell demonstrate a strong deviation from the ideal rectangular shape, indicating a non-capacitive Faradaic charge storage mechanism (Nernstian process). Further, the electrochemical behaviour of the battery-type asymmetric cell is evaluated using the galvanostic charge/discharge technique and its performance is displayed in Fig. 5d. Obviously, it shows non-linear charge–discharge characteristics that positively confirm the charge storage process through a redox reaction. The specific capacity (Faraday efficiency) is estimated for the asymmetric cell using the discharge area (relation (3)) and the values are 134 (50.5), 115 (58.4), 104 (63.8) and 98 (69.1) C g−1 (%) at constant specific currents of 4, 5, 7 and 15 A g−1 respectively (Fig. 5e). The Ragone plot in Fig. 5f describes the variation of the specific power against specific energy, estimated using relations (5) and (6). A specific energy of 30, 26, 23 and 22 W h kg−1 is estimated at an energy rate of 621, 826, 1215 and 3059 W kg−1 respectively. Nearly 73% specific energy is retained at a higher specific power, signifying a better electrochemical response of the asymmetric cell. The specific energy estimated for the NiO//α-LiFe5O8 asymmetric cell was highly comparable with previously reported cells (Fig. 5g and Table 3).33,56–58,74–80

The electrochemical impedance analysis of the asymmetric cell provides a solution resistance and charge transfer resistance of 7.4 and 12.3 Ω respectively (Fig. 5h, Nyquist plot, fitted to a Randle’ circuit). Furthermore, the electrochemical stability of the battery type NiO//α-LiFe5O8 cell upon 5000 continuous galvanostic charge discharge (GCD) cycles is tested using galvanostic charge/discharge tests at a specific current of 10 A g−1. The Coulombic efficiency and capacity retention are estimated for each interval of 200 cycles and they are displayed in Fig. 5i.30 An average Coulombic efficiency of 82.5% could be seen for 5000 continuous GCD cycles. The capacity retention is gradually increased from 71.4% capacity and attains a maximum of 100% at the 3600th cycle. This maximum capacity can be observed up to the 4600th charge discharge cycle. Interestingly, the fabricated cell reveals 100% capacity for 1000 continuous GCD cycles. The degradation of the capacity is seen for further increasing GCD cycles and it retains 90.5% of its maximum capacity value at the end of 5000 GCD cycles.

4. Conclusion
In conclusion, battery-type α-LiFe5O8 nanorods were synthesized via a facile and cost-effective aqueous precipitation route. The porous structure seems to remarkably enlarge the specific capacity during the charge/discharge process. A specific capacity of 999 C g−1 (2 A g−1) along with 94.8% retention (5000 cycles) is estimated in the present study for the microporous α-LiFe5O8 electrodes via a quasi-conversion reaction. Such enhanced electrochemical properties arise out of the rapid redox reaction kinetics across the electrode/electrolyte interface. The same seem to have their origins in the porous texture, nanorods and the possible synergistic effect. Besides, interconnected 2D nanoflakes of NiO were prepared by thermal decomposition of pre-synthesized α-Ni(OH)2 sheets at 350 °C estimating a specific capacity of 477 C g−1 (2 A g−1). A battery-type asymmetric supercapacitor based on α-LiFe5O8 with NiO as the counter electrode displays 73% retention of the specific energy even at a high specific power of 3 kW kg−1 and better cycling performance (90.5% retention after 5000 cycles). This work demonstrates a strategy to prepare mesoporous architectures for the application of light weight, flexible and wearable electronic devices.
