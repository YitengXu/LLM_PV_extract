Moreover, by covering the sample with a crucible in the annealing process, a significant cathodic shift of the onset potential (up to 70 mV) was observed. Data suggested that a higher inside pressure was introduced by the cover, which led to a further reduction of hematite in the near surface region. The depth-reduction resulted in a cathodic shift compared to the sample treated in the surface region. The cathodic shift was also confirmed at various concentrations of AB and annealing temperatures. Our results suggest that the treating depth could be a key role for the low onset potential of hematite for solar water oxidation.
Introduction
Hematite has emerged as a good photocatalyst for solar water oxidation due to its low cost, abundance, high stability in aqueous solution, and favorable band gap.1–9 However, its practical performance has been limited by various factors such as poor conductivity, short lifetime of the excited-state carrier (10−12 s), poor oxygen evolution reaction (OER) kinetics, short hole diffusion length (2–4 nm), and improper band position for unassisted water splitting.5–16
Because of the improper band position of hematite, a bias of about 0.4 V vs. RHE has to be applied for the oxidation of water. Moreover, the poor OER kinetics, the accumulation of photo-excited holes or many other reasons may lead to additional bias for water oxidation, which will significantly decrease the efficiency.12–14 A low onset potential for the water oxidation process is thus important for the performance of hematite. Many methods have been developed to improve the performance of hematite.3–16 Recently, by introducing oxygen vacancies into hematite its performance was significantly improved with increased conductivity.7,10,11,17,18 Various methods have been used to produce oxygen vacancies such as controlling the oxygen content (oxygen-deficient atmosphere) in the sintering process or the reduction of hematite in a reductive atmosphere such as H2.10,11,17,18 The first method could significantly improve the photocurrent but typically had a relatively high onset potential (about 1.0 V vs. RHE).10,11,17 This was attributed to the bulk effect of oxygen vacancies, which may act as recombination centers for the electrons and holes.14,18,19 Compared to the first method, the second method recently exhibited advantages by both increasing the photocurrent and decreasing the onset potential to a low value of about 0.87 V vs. RHE.18 This was achieved by the pyrolysis of solid NaBH4 powder in a crucible to release controllable H2. A surface effect of the H2-treatment was revealed to be important for the low onset potential of hematite compared to the bulk effect by controlling the oxygen content.18 Herein, we extend our study of producing oxygen vacancies in hematite by the pyrolysis of NH3BH3 (AB) solution on hematite in a crucible. The photocurrent of AB-treated hematite also shows obvious improvement. In addition, we find that the crucible as a cover may significantly affect the onset potential, which shows an obvious cathodic shift (up to 70 mV) compared to the sample treated without the cover. The two separate processes of increasing the photocurrent and lowering the onset potential allow us to further understand the factors affecting the onset potential shift. Various concentrations of AB and annealing temperatures have been applied to study the cathodic shift and the results suggest that it can be attributed to a depth-reduction of hematite in the near surface region by increased pressure. The present study suggests that the treating depth of hematite is very important for the onset potential, which should be optimized to the near surface region.
Experimental section
Preparation of α-Fe2O3 photoanodes
Hematite nanostructures were prepared on a fluorine-doped SnO2 (FTO, Nippon Sheet Glass, Japan, 14 ohm sq−1) glass by a modified hydrothermal method.6,17,18 The experimental details to prepare pristine hematite can be seen in ref. 18.
The reduction of the pristine hematite was performed by the pyrolysis of NH3BH3 (AB, Sigma-Aldrich Co.) solution. AB solutions with various concentrations (0.0125 M, 0.025 M, and 0.05 M) were dropped on an FTO–hematite (pristine hematite on FTO glass) slide (cut to 18 mm × 12 mm × 2 mm). The system was supported on a quartz glass and then annealed in air or with a crucible (15 cm3) as a cover at different temperatures (400–600 °C) for 40 min in a muffle furnace (the experimental setup can be found in ESI Fig. S1†). In this study, the crucible covers the hematite sample with AB solution dropped on the hematite, while for the pyrolysis of solid NaBH4 powder, in ref. 18, the powder is located at the bottom of the crucible and is covered by the FTO with the hematite sample facing the bottom. The different setups allow us to test the role of the crucible, since either with or without the crucible, the hematite will be treated with H2. H2 can be released from AB for the reduction of the pristine hematite when the temperature is higher than 200 °C. After AB-treatment, the samples were washed with deionized water to remove the residues. The samples treated by AB solution and then annealed in air or in a crucible were labeled as AB-treated hematite and AB-treated hematite with cover, respectively.
Structural characterization
A FEI-quanta 200 scanning electron microscope with an acceleration voltage of 20 kV was used to obtain the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images. We used a FEI/Philips Techai 12 BioTWIN transmission electron microscope and a CM200 FEG transmission electron microscope to obtain the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and High-Resolution TEM (HRTEM) images, respectively. X-Ray diffraction (XRD, PANalytical, Empyrean) and X-ray photoelectron spectrometers (XPS, Kratos AXIS UltraDLD) were also used for structure characterization.
PEC measurements
The working area of the hematite photoanodes was about 0.1 cm2 and the remaining parts were covered by non-conductive Hysol epoxy. The white light source was a Xenon High Brightness Cold Light Source (XD-300) coupled with a filter (AM 1.5 G) with a light power density of 100 mW cm−2 (spectrally corrected). A xenon lamp (CEL-HXF300/CEL-HXBF300, 300 W) coupled with a monochromator (Omni-λ3005) was used to measure the IPCE spectra. A CHI 660D electrochemical workstation in a three-electrode electrochemical cell was used for the PEC measurement. The electrolyte was an aqueous solution of NaOH with a pH of about 13.6. The measured potentials were converted to the RHE scale according to the Nernst equation.6 The potential was swept from 0.6 V to 1.8 V vs. RHE at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. Capacitance was derived from the electrochemical impedance obtained at each potential with 10000 Hz frequency in the dark. Mott–Schottky plots were obtained from the capacitance values.
Results and discussion
Fig. 1 shows SEM images of the pristine and AB-treated hematite nanostructures (with and without cover, optimized at an AB concentration of 0.025 M and temperature of 500 °C). The morphology of the samples is a thin film of nanorods on the FTO substrate. All the samples show similar morphology. Fig. 2a and b show the TEM and HRTEM images of AB-treated hematite with cover at an AB concentration of 0.025 M and temperature of 500 °C, respectively. TEM dark field images and the corresponding elemental mappings for the AB-treated hematite nanostructures with cover are shown in Fig. 2c–e, and they reveal the uniform distribution of Fe and O in the hematite nanorods. In Fig. S2 (ESI†), the XRD data are also shown, which clearly indicate the existence of the typical hematite structure (JCPDS 33-0664).

In Fig. 3a, we show the J–V scans for the hematite photoanodes before and after the AB-treatment (with and without cover at an AB concentration of 0.025 M and temperature of 500 °C). Evidently, the photocurrent of the pristine hematite is relatively low (0.83 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE) compared to that of the AB-treated sample without cover, which is 1.51 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE. The increased photocurrent can be attributed to the introduction of oxygen vacancies by the AB-treatment.10,11,17,18 However, when an additional cover (the crucible) is used in the annealing process, a significant cathodic shift of the onset potential can be observed with an increased photocurrent density of 1.70 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE, which is more than 2 times higher than that of the pristine hematite. The AB-treated sample with cover shows a low onset potential of 0.87 V vs. RHE compared to the onset potential of 0.94 V vs. RHE for the AB-treated sample without cover (herein, we use the potential at the intersection point of the dark current and the tangent at the maximum slope of the photocurrent).12,13 The onset potential shifted cathodically by up to 70 mV. Although enhanced photocurrent and low onset potential caused by the introduction of oxygen vacancies have been observed in a previous report,18 the two separate processes and the lowering of the onset potential just by using an additional cover have not been observed before. The results allow us to further understand the factors affecting the onset potential shift, which are important for practical applications. The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiencies (IPCE) data are also shown in Fig. 3b (at 1.23 V vs. RHE). The AB-treated sample shows enhanced IPCE values compared to those of the pristine sample and the values can be further enhanced by using a cover. The IPCE data are consistent with the J–V curves. A maximum IPCE value of 39% (at a wavelength of 350 nm) can be observed for the AB-treated sample with cover. We have also measured the stability (at 1.23 V vs. RHE, ESI Fig. S3†) and the results indicate that the samples are very stable.

The AB-treatment leads to increased photocurrent, as shown in Fig. 3a, while an additional cover (the crucible) results in a further cathodic shift of the onset potential. The role of the crucible (or the cover) is thus important, and needs to be carefully understood. Actually, an additional cover in the annealing process may lead to a higher concentration of H2 and higher pressure in the crucible, both of which will affect the hydrogen-treatment compared to treatment in air. To test the concentration effect, we performed further experiments with higher concentration (0.05 M) of AB and higher annealing temperature (600 °C) (without cover). Both higher concentration and temperature may increase the H2 concentration. We show the results in Fig. 4a with a comparison to the curve of hematite treated at 0.025 M and 500 °C (all samples are without cover). It is clear that the methods of increasing the AB concentration or the temperature do not improve the performance of hematite, suggesting that the effect of the cover cannot be assigned to a higher concentration of H2. Actually, the high concentration of H2 may even result in decreased photocurrent by creating too many oxygen vacancies, which will lead to the formation of Fe3O4 on the surface.10,17,18

(b) J–V scans for the pristine and AB-treated (with and without cover) hematite photoanodes at an AB concentration of 0.05 M and temperature of 500 °C. (c) J–V scans for the pristine and AB-treated (with and without cover) hematite photoanodes at an AB concentration of 0.025 M and temperature of 600 °C. In both (b and c) the curve for the AB-treated (with cover) hematite photoanode at an AB concentration of 0.025 M and temperature of 500 °C is shown for comparison. 
To further investigate the concentration effect, the curves for hematite samples treated at a higher concentration (0.05 M) of AB with and without cover are shown in Fig. 4b. The hematite photoanode treated with cover also shows a cathodic shift of the onset potential compared to that without cover, confirming the true effect of the cover. However, the shift is very small, suggesting that a higher concentration of H2 is not the main effect of the cover. The performance of the sample with a higher concentration (0.05 M) of AB and with cover is also lower than that of the sample treated at 0.025 M and 500 °C with cover (blue curve).
Another effect of the cover, i.e. the increase of the inside pressure, was also studied. A higher temperature will lead to both higher pressure and higher H2 concentration in a crucible. In Fig. 4c, we show the samples treated at a higher temperature (600 °C) and the same AB concentration (with and without cover) to investigate the pressure effect. An obvious cathodic shift of the onset potential can be observed for the sample with cover compared to that without cover. As discussed above, the increased H2 concentration will not improve the performance and may even result in worse performance due to the formation of Fe3O4. Thus, the cathodic shift of the onset potential in Fig. 4c should be mainly attributed to the increased inside pressure. The onset potential shift at a higher temperature, shown in Fig. 4c, is also obviously prominent compared to that at a higher AB concentration, shown in Fig. 4b, suggesting that the increased pressure at a higher temperature should be the main effect of the cover to improve the performance of hematite. Thus, we can build a model to explain the onset potential shift caused by using a cover, as shown in Fig. 5. The AB-treatment directly in air will introduce oxygen vacancies (reduction of hematite) only on the surface region of the hematite. The concentration of surface oxygen vacancies should be optimized to achieve good performance, and further surface reduction may even lead to poor performance (Fig. 4a). However, when a cover is used in the annealing process, the increased pressure in the limited space of the crucible may lead to the further reduction of hematite in the near surface region (a region deeper than the surface but still not the bulk, see Fig. 5). The depth-treatment will further improve the conductivity and the hole accumulation can thus be reduced, resulting in low onset potential.14,18

To confirm the pressure-induced depth-treatment, we show in Fig. 6 the Mott–Schottky curves of AB-treated hematite samples, which can be used to calculate the carrier densities.16–18 The hematite samples are all n-type semiconductors due to their positive Mott–Schottky slopes. According to the references,16–18 the carrier (donor) density of the AB-treated (without cover) hematite sample is calculated to be 1.91 × 1017 cm−3, which is about one order higher than that of the pristine hematite (2.14 × 1016 cm−3). The enhanced carrier density can be responsible for the improved photocurrent by the AB-treatment, which is consistent with previous reports.17,18 Moreover, AB-treated hematite with an additional cover shows a even higher donor density of 3.98 × 1017 cm−3, which is 2 times that of the sample without cover. The inset in Fig. 6 clearly shows the difference between the AB-treated hematite samples with and without cover. The increased donor density with a cover can be attributed to the depth-reduction in the near surface region. The depth-reduction will result in better oxygen vacancy distribution, which is not a simple addition on the surface region but further improves the conductivity in the near surface region. The distribution of oxygen vacancies in the deeper near surface region may effectively reduce the hole accumulation and thus show a significant cathodic shift of the onset potential. Our results suggest that the treating depth of hematite is very important for the onset potential, which should be optimized to the near surface region.

The electronic structure of the AB-treated hematite nanostructures obtained by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is shown in Fig. 7. All the samples show strong Fe and O signals, confirming the hematite structure. Additional C and Sn signals can be observed, which represent adsorbed carbon contamination and Sn-doping originating from the diffusion of Sn from the FTO substrate.6 We cannot find any B or N signals in the AB-treated samples, ruling out the effect of B or N doping from the pyrolysis of AB. Further experiments with a lower concentration (0.0125 M) of AB and a lower annealing temperature (400 °C) are also shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†), they also exhibit an obvious cathodic shift of the onset potential confirming the cover effect.

Conclusions
We present the preparation of hematite nanostructures with oxygen vacancies by the pyrolysis of AB in a crucible. The AB-treated hematite photoelectrode shows a high photocurrent density of 1.7 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE, which is over 2 times that of pristine hematite. Moreover, when a cover is used in the annealing process, an obvious cathodic shift of the onset potential (up to 70 mV) can be observed, which can be attributed to the pressure-induced depth-reduction of hematite by the cover. The various concentrations of AB and annealing temperatures confirm the cathodic shift. The results show that a depth-reduction optimized to the near surface region of hematite has the best performance with a low onset potential. Our data suggest that the treating depth plays a key role in the high performance of hematite for solar water oxidation.
