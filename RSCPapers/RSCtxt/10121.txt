    , Accepted 7th December 2019First published on 9th December 2019AbstractAdditional elements in Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 (CZTSSe) absorber layers present a viable strategy to improve the performance of thin film solar cells. In this study, heterovalent cation doping by partially substituting metal cations with Ga3+ is explored by constructing a sandwich-like configuration. We demonstrated that a low doping level of Ga3+ can be successfully incorporated into the host lattice of CZTSSe to form a homogeneous Cu2ZnSn(Ga) (S,Se)4 (CZTGSSe) alloy material. Characterization was performed using SEM, EDS, XRD, Raman spectroscopy, and XPS, which showed that the material fabricated by this heterovalent cation doping method expressed high phase purity, appropriate valence components, and suitable optical bandgap, which are vital for high performance solar cells. As a result, the champion device achieves stabilized efficiency as high as 10.80%, improved by nearly 28% compared with only 8.43% for the reference device.
1. Introduction
Effectively harvesting and converting abundant solar energy into an electricity source is regarded as a promising route to meet future worldwide energy demand and for environmental protection.1–4 Kesterite, Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 (CZTSSe), has emerged as a promising next-generation photovoltaic material due to its superior absorption coefficient, earth-abundant constituent elements, direct and tunable bandgap, and amenability to solution processing characteristics.5–10 In the past few years, kesterite-based solar cells (KSCs) have achieved a power conversion efficiency (PCE) as high as 12.6%, showing a bright prospect for practical applications.5
However, despite this progress, the CZTSSe record efficiency is still far lower than that of Cu(In,Ga)(S,Se)2 (CIGSSe) chalcogenide-based solar cells, mainly owing to the low Voc or high Voc deficit (Eg/q − Voc) of kesterite, which have only attained 59% of Shockley–Queisser limit for Voc.11 This low performance of device characteristics is because of the problems encountered within the kesterite, such as bulk antisite defects, interface defects and unfavorable band alignment, and secondary phases.12–20 The reported high-efficiency CZTSSe solar cells were prepared via high temperature sintering and non-stoichiometry, which facilitates the formation of antisite defects and secondary phases.
One appealing strategy for alleviating the disorder on the Cu–Zn sublattice is to use isovalent cation-substitution that inhibits CuZn and ZnCu antisite defects.21,22 In this approach, metal cations in kesterite can be substituted with other isovalent cations, which alter the formation energy of antisite defects.11 Indeed, the experiments have successfully demonstrated the beneficial effects of fully or partially substituting for a significant improvement in efficiencies: Cu1+ by other group IA or IB (Ag1+ and Li1+) cations, Zn2+ by group IIA, IIB, or VIIB (Cd2+, Ba2+, and Mn2+) cations, and Sn4+ by group IVA (Ge4+) cations.23–34 More recently, the double cation substitution approach in the CZTS system, by partially substituting Cu with Ag and Zn with Cd, to obtain (Cu,Ag)2(Zn,Cd)SnS4 alloy compounds, has also been developed to mitigate the negative effects of different types of defects.11 Furthermore, the first-principles calculations have revealed many other elements with 1+, 2+, 4+, and 2− valences, such as Zn2+ with group IIA (Mg2+, Ca2+, and Sr2+) cations, Sn4+ with group IVB (Ti4+, Zr4+, and Hf4+) cations, and S2− with group VIA (O2− and Te2−) anions, and their complete or partial substitution can lead to a large number of potential I2–II–IV–VI4 compounds.35–41 Besides these isovalent substitutions, trivalent metallic elements can also be partially incorporated and alloyed within the kesterite phase. This strategy will offer some more promising possibilities to deal with the intractable problems encountered in CZTSSe development. Previous reports have shown that trivalent In-doping could increase the hole density and boost the Voc of CZTSSe,42–46 but there have been very few reports on searching for more heterovalent dopants until now. Therefore, the extended exploration of more heterovalent dopants to further improve the efficiencies of CZTS-based solar cells is still of great importance.
Kesterite can be derived from CuGa(S,Se)2 by replacing the two Ga3+ cations with one Zn2+ and one Sn4+cation (Fig. S1†).35 This kinship between Ga and kesterite provides great advantages in heterovalent substitution. Here, we propose a heterovalent cation substitution by partially substituting metal cations with Ga3+ in the CZTSSe system via a low-cost solution-based method. A Ga3+ gradient distribution along the depth of the absorber layer was successfully prepared and clearly detected by constructing a sandwich-like configuration, which was confirmed by secondary ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS) analysis. By optimizing the concentration of Ga precursor solution in the CZTSSe films, we have obtained a cell efficiency of up to 10.8%.
2. Results and discussion
Similar to previous reports, the Ga3+ precursor in the current strategy is prepared by dissolving Ga pellets in the mixture of 1,2-ethanedithiol (EDT) and 1,2-ethylenediamine (EN). After dissolution, Ga3+ is believed to be transformed into Ga-(HSCH2CH2HS)x, which will be abbreviated as Ga-EDT in subsequent discussion.47Fig. 1a illustrates the cell design used for the KSCs including the one consisting of Mo-coated glass/Ga3+ doped CZTSSe/CdS/i-ZnO/ITO/Ag/MgF2, as shown in Fig. 1a. For obtaining the optimal film preparation, a Ga-EDT intermediate layer was sandwiched between the top and bottom CZTSSe precursor layers. Fig. 1b and c schematically show in detail the formation process of Samples A–D. The typical thicknesses of each of the three precursor films at different stages (Samples A–C) were recorded by the cross-section SEM images, and the detailed thicknesses are given in Fig. 2a–c. In order to study the effect of the Ga-EDT concentration on the structural and optical properties of the absorber layer, four representative films with different contents of Ga-EDT (Sample C, x = 0, 1.6, 3.2, and 4.8 mg mL−1) were selected as the research objects. To maintain identical test conditions, all the samples were prepared under the same conditions. Fig. 2d shows the top-view SEM image of the Ga3+ doped as-deposited CZTSSe film (Sample B, x = 3.2 mg mL−1). Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) mapping was performed on Sample B, with the results shown in Fig. 2e–h, which show that all of the metal elements, including Ga, were distributed homogeneously throughout the as-prepared film. In addition, the compositional ratios for the selenized Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 thin films with different contents of Ga-EDT (x = 0, 1.6, 3.2, and 4.8 mg mL−1) were measured by ICP-OES and are shown in Table S1, ESI.†

XRD characterization of the selenized CZT(G)SSe thin films (Sample C) with x ranging from 0 to 4.8 mg mL−1 was performed to identify a change in the crystal structure, and the results are shown in Fig. 3a. In agreement with there being no overall phase change, the Ga3+ ions doped in the CZTSSe film formed an I4 kesterite structure.33,34,48,49 This indicates that Ga3+ in the CZTSSe films formed a homogeneous alloy material, retaining the structure of the kesterite host. Similar results were also detected by Raman scattering using different excitation wavelengths as an auxiliary method, as shown in Fig. 3b (532 nm) and Fig. S6† (633 nm and 785 nm). Some possible impurity phases (Ga2Se3, ZnSe, SnSe, SnSe2, and Cu2SnSe3) have not been detected in the Ga-doped selenized films. To further study whether the selenization conditions used in this work can form some impurity such as Ga2Se3, the 3.2 mg mL−1 Ga-EDT precursor solution was thus directly spin-coated/annealed onto Mo-coated SLG and then followed a selenization process. Schematic illustration of the fabrication for Sample D is shown in Fig. 1c. From the results of XRD of Sample D (Fig. 3c and d), it is clear that the three XRD peaks at 28.2°, 47.2°, and 56.1° can be indexed to the planes of Ga2Se3 (PDF no. 05-0724) through the selenization process.50 In comparison, the corresponding peaks were not detected in Samples B and C, indicating that no Ga2Se3 phase formed.

To understand the effect of Ga3+ on the CZTSSe films at different stages, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed for Samples A–D (including the as-prepared and selenized film). From the XPS data of Sample D (Fig. 4a-I and II, f and g-II), we can see that the peak positions of Ga 2p and Se 3d correspond well to 3+, and 2−, indicating that Ga2Se3 has formed on the Mo-coated SLG, which is highly in line with the XRD results.51 For Sample B, it was observed that there were no obvious peak shifts for the Cu, Zn, and Sn peaks after the introduction of Ga3+ into CZTSSe thin films (Fig. 4a-V and VI, b–d and e-VI). The peak splitting values and peak positons of Ga 2p, Cu 2p, Zn 2p, and Sn 3d agree well with 3+, 1+, 2+, and 4+ oxidation states, respectively, indicating a single environment for each of these components.52–54 In the case of Sample B, after selenization, the peaks of Ga 2p became so weak that they could not be identified in the wide-scan XPS data and show a very weak peak in the magnified XPS spectra for the Ga 2p (Fig. 4a and b), indicating that most of the Ga3+ has migrated to the interior of the films after the selenization process so that the XPS detection is more difficult. Interestingly, a distinct Na 1s peak at 1071 eV was detected in all the selenized films, which ascribes to some sodium migration to the selenized films from a piece of covered soda-lime glass (SLG) during the selenization process (Fig. 4a).55 In addition, it can be identified that two distinct impurity peaks at 284.7 and 531.1 eV can be attributed to the C 1s and O 1s peaks, respectively. Carbon and oxygen are incorporated mainly from the incomplete decomposition of the mixture of solvents.25,55 Furthermore, the wide-scan and high-resolution XPS results for the selenized Sample C with different Ga doping levels were also recorded, as shown in Fig. S7, ESI.†

Because the 3.2 mg mL−1 Ga-EDT solution treated CZTSSe film is the optimal one with enhanced PV performance, it is necessary to explore whether the Ga-doping distribution is homogeneous or depth dependent along the depth direction. Secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) measurements were performed to determine the Ga distribution on the cross-section of the selenized CZTSSe sample (x = 3.2 mg mL−1). The SIMS data measured on the three random points show a very similar trend, and one of them is listed in Fig. 5a (the others are listed in Fig. S8†), indicating that elemental depth distribution of Cu, Zn, Sn, and Ga from the selenized CZTSSe films is very inhomogeneous. It is clear that a Ga graded distribution in the selenized CZTSSe films is observed. This similar migration of Ga towards the Mo back-contact has also been reported in CIGS.56,57 Owing to the residual carbon from the organic ligands, there is a fine-grain layer in the selenized CZTSSe film (see Fig. S9†). Compared with the large-grain layer, the intensities of elements Cu, Zn and Sn are relatively weak. Fig. 5b and c show the depth profiles of related chemical elements for the pure and Ga-EDT doped (x = 3.2 mg mL−1) CZTSSe solar cells, respectively.

The selenized films with different Ga doping levels were used as the absorber layer to construct KSCs for photovoltaic performance evaluation. The current–voltage (J–V) curves of the champion Ga-doped KSCs and the best KSCs with different Ga doping levels, and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are presented in Fig. 6a, b, and Table 1, respectively. All results presented in this contribution have an anti-reflective coating based on MgF2 (90 nm). The reference KSCs give lower performance with a PCE of 8.43%, a Voc of 425 mV, a Jsc of 32.78 mA cm−2, and a FF of 60.59%, which are all in good agreement with the previous literature.54,58,59Fig. 6c shows the EQE spectra of Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 devices with different Ga doping levels, and the integrated Jsc of the champion Ga doped Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 (x = 3.2 mg mL−1) solar cells from EQE was 35.98 mA cm−2 (as shown in Fig. S10†), very close to the measured J–V characteristics. The origin of this discrepancy between Jsc from a solar simulator and Jsc from EQE could be attributed to some problem involving either the cell area or the areas used in the spectral response measurements. Meanwhile, the band gap of different Ga-doped CZTSSe absorber layers was determined from a plot of [E × ln(1 − EQE)]2vs. E (Fig. 6d and Table 1). Due to the lack of Ga3+ doping effect on the bandgap of CZTSSe, we turn to theoretical calculations, and the results are shown in Fig. 7. The band gaps of the pristine and Ga-doped sample are calculated to be 0.086 eV and 0.080 eV, respectively. Normally, the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) level often underestimates the band gap of semiconductors. Therefore, we also corrected the band gaps using the Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof (HSE) methods, and the corrected band gaps are calculated to be 1.166 eV and 1.144 eV for the pristine and Ga-doped sample, respectively.60 As can be seen, the band gap of Ga-doped CZTS is slightly smaller than that of the pristine CZTS. From the partial density of states analysis, no obvious change of the compositions of the valence band maximum (VBM) and conduction band minimum (CBM) can be found by Ga doping, as shown in Fig. 7a. It is noted that there is a slight shrink of the lattice constants upon Ga3+ substitution; thus we assume that the slight bandgap reduction is ascribed to the stress effect induced by a smaller radius of Ga3+. As we know, the decrease of the bond length results in a more dispersive VB and CB and thus reduces the band gap of the host, which can be applied to our case here. In a word, Ga substitution won't change the bandgap much comparable to the pristine, and the Ga doping may in a way slightly reduce the bandgap, which also has been demonstrated by our experimental results. The device performance is found to be significantly improved as the Ga-EDT intermediated layer is introduced. With the increase in the Ga doping level from 1.6 to 4.8 mg mL−1, the PCE first increases from 9.28 to 10.80% and then decreases to 8.33%. When the Ga doping concentration was increased to 3.2 mg mL−1, the PCE reached a maximum of 10.80% (as well as a Voc of 455 mV, a Jsc of 36.48 mA cm−2, and a FF of 65.05%), and the structure of the champion cell is shown in Fig. S9.† The corresponding KSC parameters as a function of Ga doping levels are shown in Fig. S11.† To ensure the reliability and reproducibility of the J–V results, more than 120 separate KSCs with different Ga doping levels were fabricated.61,62 Statistical box charts of photovoltaic parameters as a function of Ga doping levels are shown in Fig. 8 a–d, and the detailed device parameters are listed in Table S2.† It appears that the 3.2 mg mL−1 Ga-doped devices have a clear advantage in terms of PCE, meaning that the devices show very good reproducibility. These results unequivocally prove that the optimal Ga doping via the solution-processed approach is capable of enhancing CZTSSe solar cell efficiency, and Ga3+ doping tends to segregate in the fine-grain bottom layer. One possibility for this improvement could be such that the introduction of Ga3+ altered the electrical properties of the bottom layer. It has been found that trivalent dopants like In3+ can reduce the number of highly resistive ZnSe segregating at the rear side of the kesteritein the previous work.63–65 Since many researchers in the field have published J–V curves without antireflection coating (ARC), for comparison purpose, we measured the PCE of 35 solar cells before and after evaporating ARC, and compared the PCE enhancements between the devices with and without ARC, and all results are shown in Fig. 9. Fig. 9b shows the distribution of the increment percentage of PCE after evaporating ARC; the values are distributed from 2% to 16%, and most are distributed between 8% and 10%. The average efficiency enhancement is 9.26%. To further improve the performance of the device, we will try to simultaneously dissolve Ga pellets with Cu, Zn, and Sn in the mixed precursor solution of 1,2-ethylenediamine and 1,2-ethanedithiol in the next research work.

3. Conclusion
In summary, the effects of the partial heterovalent substitution of metal cations with Ga3+ by constructing a sandwich-like configuration have been realized. The results demonstrated that the low doping level of Ga3+ as the intermediate layer was successfully incorporated into the host lattice of CZTSSe thin films to form the Cu2ZnSn(Ga)(S,Se)4 alloying materials. It was found that the Ga3+ was more likely to migrate to the Mo electrode, thus forming a Ga3+ doping graded distribution. It is speculated that the introduction of Ga3+ improved the electrical properties of the bottom layer according to the In3+ doping in kesterite solar cells. Thus, our results provided a new pathway to improve earth-abundant kesterite solar cells as a prospective replacement for CIGSSe devices. We believe that further improvement for achieving even better efficiencies requires extensive systematic investigations on the electrical properties of the absorber layers through Ga doping in future research.

Synthesis of CZTSSe and Ga-EDT precursor solution

(1) Solution A (CZTSSe solution). 
To prepare a CZTSSe precursor solution, 2.2 mmol of Cu, 1.52 mmol of Zn, 1.42 mmol of Sn, 5.34 mmol of S, and 0.58 mmol of Se were weighed and transferred to a round-bottom flask. Next, 10.0 mL ethylenediamine and 1.0 mL 1,2-ethanedithiol were injected into the flask. After about 90 min of magnetic stirring at 70 °C, 2 mL of stabilizing agent (ethanolamine, mercaptoacetic acid, and 2-methoxyethanol in a volume ratio of 1:1:2) was added to the above solution, and continued with 30-minute stirring to improve the viscidity and stability of the precursor solution. Finally, a homogeneous faint yellow solution was obtained.


(2) Solution B (Ga-EDT precursor solution). 
To investigate the effects of the Ga doping level on the performance of devices, three Ga-EDT precursor solutions of different concentrations (0, 1.6, 3.2, and 4.8 mg mL−1) were prepared. First, 0.1 mmol, 0.2 mmol, and 0.3 mmol of Ga pellets were added to three 25 mL round-bottom flasks respectively. Afterwards, 4 mmol Se powder was weighed in sequence and transferred to the three round-bottom flasks. Then, 4.0 mL of 1,2-ethylenediamine and 0.4 mL of 1,2-ethanedithiol were injected into each of the three round-bottom flasks. The three Ga-EDT solutions were magnetically stirred at 70 °C for 12 h until all of the solids were dissolved. The digital photographs of the CZTSSe precursor solution and the three Ga-EDT precursor solutions are shown in Fig. S2.† All solution preparation processes were performed in an air-filled fume cupboard.

Deposition and selenization of CZTSSe and CZTGSSe thin films
The CZTSSe (CZTGSSe) thin-films were deposited using the spin-coating process in an argon-filled glovebox. First, Solution A was spin-coated onto Mo-coated soda lime glasses (SLG, square resistance: 0.3–0.6 Ω □−1) at 3000 rpm for 30 s, followed by sintering on a 330 °C hot plate for 3 min. The spin-coating/sintering cycles were repeated according to the schematic description in Fig. 1 and until the precursor film had a targeted thickness (∼510 nm), Sample A was successfully prepared. Next, Solution B with different Ga-EDT concentrations (0, 1.6, 3.2, and 4.8 mg mL−1) was spin-coated/annealed on the prepared Sample A respectively, and then Sample B (B1– B4) was successfully obtained. It is noted that Sample B1 (0 mg mL−1) omitted this step. Finally, Solution A was deposited on Sample B (B1–B4) until the precursor film had a targeted thickness (∼1800 nm) respectively, and Sample C (C1–C4) was successfully prepared. In addition, Sample D was prepared by spin-coating/annealing Solution B (3.2 mg mL−1) onto Mo-coated SLG. Schematic illustration of the fabrication procedures of Samples A–D is shown in Fig. 1b and S3.† The as-prepared Samples A–D were then selenized in a round graphite box containing 300 mg of selenium (Se, 99.9999%) at 550 °C for 15 min in a rapid thermal processing (RTP) furnace (MTI, OTF-1200X-4-RTP, and heated to 550 °C at 8.7 °C s−1) with a nitrogen flow of 80 mL min−1.
