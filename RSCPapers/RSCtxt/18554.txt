    , Accepted 27th October 2020First published on 28th October 2020AbstractCaH2 has 20 times the energy density of molten salts and was patented in 2010 as a potential solar thermal energy storage material. Unfortunately, its high operating temperature (>1000 °C) and corrosivity at that temperature make it challenging to use as a thermal energy storage (TES) material in concentrating solar power (CSP) plants. To overcome these practical limitations, here we propose the thermodynamic destabilization of CaH2 with Zn metal. It is a unique approach that reduces the decomposition temperature of pure CaH2 (1100 °C at 1 bar of H2 pressure) to 597 °C at 1 bar of H2 pressure. Its new decomposition temperature is closer to the required target temperature range for TES materials used in proposed third-generation high-temperature CSP plants. A three-step dehydrogenation reaction between CaH2 and Zn (1:3 molar ratio) was identified from mass spectrometry, temperature-programmed desorption and in situ X-ray diffraction studies. Three reaction products, CaZn13, CaZn11 and CaZn5, were confirmed from in situ X-ray diffraction studies at 190 °C, 390 °C and 590 °C, respectively. The experimental enthalpy and entropy of the second hydrogen release reaction were determined by pressure composition isotherm measurements, conducted between 565 and 614 °C, as ΔHdes = 131 ± 4 kJ mol−1 H2 and ΔSdes = 151 ± 4 J K−1 mol−1 H2. Hydrogen cycling studies of CaZn11 at 580 °C showed sufficient cycling capacity with no significant sintering occurring during heating, as confirmed by scanning electron microscopy, demonstrating its great potential as a TES material for CSP applications. Finally, a cost comparison study of known destabilized CaH2 systems was carried out to assess the commercial potential.
Introduction
The primary objective of the next-generation concentrating solar power plants (CSP) is to provide continuous electrical power supply at a 40% cost reduction in comparison to the plants currently operating.1 This cost reduction can be met due to the higher power cycle efficiency achieved in a 600–800 °C temperature range by replacing a conventional steam power engine with a Stirling engine.2 Specifically, the US Department of Energy released the Sun Shot research programme with a target to develop thermal energy storage (TES) materials that operate above 600 °C, have ≥95% exergetic efficiency and cost less than $15 per kW hth by 2030. Hence, the identification of a cost-effective high-temperature TES material that meets these requirements is both essential and challenging.3–7
There are a plethora of known TES materials that can be categorized depending on their heat storage mechanism, storage density and operating temperature. Sensible heat storage materials, such as molten salts, are the most commonly used TES materials in the industry.3 Nevertheless, molten salts suffer from several drawbacks such as low energy density (0.02–0.03 kW h kg−1), corrosion and limited operating temperature (<565 °C).8,9 Latent heat storage materials have a higher energy density (0.05–0.1 kW h kg−1) than the sensible heat storage materials, but most of the materials presently studied have issues such as low thermal conductivity, and high thermal losses.4,10,11 To overcome these drawbacks, a third category of TES materials known as thermochemical energy storage is gaining increasing popularity due the high energy density (0.5–1 kW h kg−1) that these materials possess despite their increased complexity. The superior energy storage properties are based on reversible chemical reactions that take place at high temperatures.12,13 At present, six systems, namely hydrides, carbonates, hydroxides, oxides, ammonia and organic are identified as thermochemical TES materials.11 The unique property of metal hydrides to absorb and release hydrogen at a specific pressure at high temperatures, makes them the most promising thermochemical system amongst the rest, and thereby meeting the requirements of the next generation CSP plants.10,14–16 Calcium hydride is a promising high-temperature metal hydride due to its: (i) low cost ($6000 per ton) and abundance, (ii) low operating hydrogen pressure at high temperature (1–5 bar at 1100–1400 °C), (iii) high enthalpy of dehydrogenation (207.9 kJ mol−1 H2), and (iv) high gravimetric (4939 kJ kg−1) and volumetric energy densities (8396 MJ m−3).2,17,18 Its high operating temperature (1100 °C), melting point of both CaH2 and Ca metal are 816 °C and 842 °C, and expensive tank material requirements to store the corrosive CaH2, are the main factors that limit the use of pure CaH2 as a thermochemical TES material.17,20,21 Thermodynamic destabilization of CaH2 using suitable additives, is one approach for reducing the decomposition temperature of CaH2, and transforming it as a suitable TES material for the third generation CSP plants.22
The main novelty of this study lies in the selection of a relatively inexpensive and abundant metal such as zinc ($1.93 per kg), to be used as an additive in order to reduce the decomposition temperature of CaH2 as illustrated in Fig. 1. A previous destabilisation approach demonstrated that adding Al2O3 to CaH2 lowered the enthalpy of the reaction to ΔH = 100 kJ mol−1 H2 at 636 °C and 1 bar of H2 pressure.23 CaH2–3Zn is an alternate system that exploits the feasibility of Zn as a high-temperature thermochemical TES material for the third generation CSP plants. The aim of this study focused on thermal analysis, and thermodynamic characterization of the CaH2–3Zn system using mass spectrometry, temperature programmed desorption and in situ X-ray diffraction studies. Its cycling capacity, sample morphology before and after cycling using field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) and cost analysis were also investigated and reported.

Experimental methods
Sample preparation
All chemicals were stored and handled inside an Ar filled MBraun unilab glovebox to reduce oxygen (<1 ppm) and water (<1 ppm) contamination. CaH2 (Sigma Aldrich, >95% purity powder) and Zn (Chem supply, >98% purity powder) were mixed in a 1:3 molar ratio and milled under an Ar atmosphere using an Across International Planetary Ball Mill (PQ-N04), employing stainless steel vials and balls. The mixture was ball milled for 3 hours with a 40:1 ball (equal number of 10 mm and 6 mm diameter balls) to powder ratio. The rotational speed was set to 400 rpm with a change of direction every 30 minutes without pausing.
Sample characterization

Theoretical predictions. 
The possible reaction pathways between CaH2 and Zn were predicted using the phase diagram of the Ca–Zn system.25,26 The volatility of solid calcium zinc alloys are linked with the vapor pressure of Zn. The vapor pressure of pure Zn metal and Ca was calculated from room temperature to 1000 °C.27 Vapor pressure data of calcium zinc solid alloys were also derived from Chiotti et al.37 and Hodge et al.39 and the vapor pressures of eight calcium zinc alloys (Ca3Zn, Ca5Zn3, CaZn, CaZn2, CaZn3, CaZn5, CaZn11 and CaZn13) were plotted along with pure Zn and Ca as a function of temperature in Fig. S1 (ESI†). Among the eight solid alloys, Zn rich alloys have high vapor pressures and are less volatile than Zn poor alloys at higher temperatures (>600 °C).

Powder X-ray diffraction

Ex situ powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) was used to identify the crystalline materials in each sample. Airtight polymethyl methacrylate domed sample holders were used to avoid oxygen and moisture contamination during data collection. Data were collected using a Bruker D8 Advance Diffractometer with a copper X-ray tube (λ = 1.5418 Å, 40 kV, 40 mA) in the 10°–80° 2θ range with a 0.03° step size and 1.6 s per step count time. The diffraction peaks were quantitatively analyzed by the Rietveld method28 using the Bruker TOPAS Version 5 software.29 The structural information was extracted from ICDD PDF4 database and the Crystallography Open Database (COD).30

In situ X-ray diffraction was performed using a Thermo Fisher ARL Equinox 5000 diffractometer (λ = 0.7093 Å, Mo-Kα, 50 kV, 30 mA). The sample was loaded into a quartz capillary tube (0.7 mm outer diameter, 0.01 mm wall thickness), sealed and then mounted onto a sample holder inside an Ar filled glovebox. The sample was heated from room temperature to 692 °C using a hot air blower (5 °C min−1) and kept isothermal for 2 hours. Data were acquired on a CPS 120 detector (0–60° 2θ) with a 60 s exposure time. The temperature of the hot air blower was calibrated against the known thermal expansion coefficient of both NaCl and Ag.31–33
Mass spectrometry
Temperature programmed desorption-mass spectrometry (TPD-MS) measurements were obtained using a Stanford Research Systems (SRS, RGA-300) residual gas analyzer consisting of a quadrupole mass spectrometer.34 A 3 mg sample of pure CaH2 and CaH2–3Zn was placed in a stainless steel sample holder inside a silicon carbide reactor that was connected to the spectrometer. The samples were heated to 850 °C at 5 °C min−1 under high vacuum (<7 × 10−4 mbar). The corresponding analogue scan of partial pressure vs. mass to charge ratio was obtained from the RGA software. A K-type thermocouple with an uncertainty of ±1.5 °C was connected inside the SiC tube to record the temperature of the sample.
Temperature programmed desorption and pressure composition isotherms
H2 sorption properties were studied by Temperature Programmed Desorption (TPD), using a computer-controlled Sievert's apparatus.35 CaH2–3Zn was heated to either 630 °C or 830 °C, with 5 °C min−1 heating rates. The powder mixture was placed inside a stainless-steel sample holder and then loaded into a silicon carbide (SiC) reactor. H2 has a negligible hydrogen permeation through SiC at high temperatures (>450 °C) and therefore was chosen as the most suitable reactor material for such measurements.35,36 The sample temperature was measured using a K-type thermocouple which is kept inside the SiC reactor and in direct contact with the sample. Pressure Composition Isotherm (PCI) measurements of CaH2–3Zn were conducted on the same apparatus to acquire the thermodynamic properties of the dehydrogenation reaction between 565 °C and 614 °C with a 1 bar pressure step size and a 3 h equilibration time per step. H2 desorption and absorption cycling studies were performed on CaH2–3Zn at 580 °C with a ramp rate of 5 °C min−1. The H2 pressure and equilibration time during desorption was ∼0.8 bar and 3 h respectively, whereas during absorption it was ∼2.8 bar and 5 h.
Scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy
Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy were carried out using a Tescan Mira3 integrated with EBSD/EDS Oxford Instrument detectors controlled by the Aztec software. The SEM images of the CaH2–3Zn system before and after cycling were collected using both secondary and back-scattered electron detectors. The SEM samples were prepared inside an Ar filled glove box by placing a small amount of powder onto a carbon tape, and then transferred to the SEM chamber with minimum air exposure.
Results and discussion
Theoretical predictions
The phase diagram of the Ca–Zn system shows eight different alloys (Ca3Zn, Ca5Zn3, CaZn, CaZn2, CaZn3, CaZn5, CaZn11 and CaZn13) at different molar ratios.25,26 Table S1 (ESI†) indicates theoretically possible reactions between CaH2 and Zn and the corresponding theoretical H2 wt%. The vapor pressure of Zn plays a vital role in the formation and volatility of the solid alloy formation.27,37–39 Fig. S1 (ESI†) shows the vapor pressure curve of pure Ca, Zn and solid calcium zinc alloys as a function of temperature. It shows that the vapor pressure of pure Zn is higher than pure Ca until 600 °C, after which the vapor pressure of Zn is less than that of pure Ca. From Fig. S1 (ESI†) and the Ca–Zn phase diagram it can be seen that Zn rich alloys have higher vapor pressures and hence are less likely to produce vaporized Zn above 600 °C.25 Moreover, above ∼700 °C no calcium zinc solid alloys exist.
Initial phase analysis
The diffraction patterns of as-supplied CaH2, Zn and ball-milled CaH2–3Zn are presented in Fig. 2a, b and c, respectively. Quantitative phase analysis was used to determine the purity of the materials using the Rietveld method. Quantitative phase analysis of the CaH2 reagent shows CaH2 with a negligible amount of crystalline CaO, while the XRD and refinement pattern for the ball milled CaH2–3Zn only shows CaH2 (16.5 ± 0.8 wt%), and Zn (83 ± 1 wt%) (Fig. 2c and Fig. S2, ESI†). This indicates that no reaction occurred between CaH2 and Zn during ball milling to form a Ca–Zn product as expected by the high required enthalpy of reaction.

The destabilization of CaH2 using Zn
TPD-MS measurements were performed on CaH2 and CaH2–3Zn to compare the H2 gas release profiles as a function of temperature (Fig. 3a and b respectively). Due to the high vacuum (<7 × 10−4 mbar) employed in this technique, CaH2 commenced H2 release at 500 °C and reached the highest rate of hydrogen release at 600 °C (Fig. 3a), with the single decomposition peak indicative of a one-step decomposition reaction. The H2 desorption profile of CaH2–3Zn (Fig. 3b) consisted of three H2 peaks denoting a three-step decomposition reaction, either due to differing kinetics or thermodynamics of reaction. The first small peak appeared at 200 °C, followed by two high intensity peaks at 300 °C and 420 °C, respectively. H2 was the only gas detected during heating to 800 °C. The three low-temperature decomposition peaks of the CaH2–3Zn sample show that the addition of Zn thermodynamically destabilizes the CaH2.

Thermal analysis
A TPD measurement was conducted on CaH2–3Zn by heating the sample from room temperature to 830 °C (5 °C min−1), before keeping the temperature isothermal at 830 °C for 10 hours to check the volatility of the alloy formed (Fig. 4a). The measurement was commenced under initial static vacuum and reached a maximum H2 pressure of 0.9 bar. After 2 hours at 830 °C the hydrogen pressure began to decrease. The reason for this pressure decrease was due to: (i) zinc evaporation from the alloy as evidenced by zinc metal deposition on the cool regions of the sample cell, and (ii) H2 reabsorption into the zinc-poor calcium metal to reform CaH2. This was confirmed from the sample's ex situ XRD pattern obtained after the TPD measurement (Fig. 5a), which comprised of CaH2 and Zn peaks with no calcium zinc alloy peaks being present. The TPD measurement was repeated with a maximum temperature of 630 °C and a subsequent isotherm for 10 h. A maximum H2 pressure of 0.58 bar was reached starting from vacuum. Fig. 4b illustrates the TPD profile, which exhibits an almost isobaric profile after reaching 630 °C with reduced Zn evaporation observed in comparison to the data obtained at 830 °C. CaZn11 and CaZn5 alloys were the main decomposition products at 630 °C as confirmed by the sample's ex situ XRD pattern obtained after the TPD measurement (Fig. 5b).

Identifying the reaction pathway by in situ X-ray diffraction

In situ XRD data of CaH2–3Zn during thermal ramping under argon is presented in Fig. 6a and is compared with its differential TPD profile (Fig. 6b). It is evident from the in situ XRD patterns that the reaction between CaH2 and Zn occurs in a three-step reaction between 190 and 590 °C, which is in a good agreement with the TPD profiles. It is clear from Fig. 6a the three different alloys formed are CaZn13, CaZn11 and CaZn5 at three different temperature ranges of 190–390 °C, 390–590 °C and >590 °C, respectively. The experimental reaction can be predicted from the in situ XRD data as follows, which shows the presence of excess CaH2. (1) (2) (3)

Thermodynamic calculations
As the ex situ XRD pattern of CaH2–3Zn after the TPD measurement at 830 °C did not exhibit any solid calcium–zinc alloy present in the decomposed sample, PCI measurements were performed at temperatures below 630 °C. The measurements were carried out at 565, 580, 600 and 614 °C (Fig. 7a). The corresponding van't Hoff plot (Fig. 7b) was constructed by plotting the midpoint values from the first plateau region of each PCI measurement to acquire the enthalpy and entropy of reaction. The optimized form (no excess CaH2) of the above mentioned three reactions can be written as follows: CaH2 + 13Zn → CaZn13 + H2(g)(4) CaH2 + 11Zn → CaZn11 + H2 (g)(5) (6)The corresponding enthalpy and entropy of the optimized reaction (5), obtained from first plateau as shown in figure a, were calculated as ΔHdes = 131.5 ± 4.0 kJ mol−1 H2, ΔSdes = 151.1 ± 4.0 J K−1 mol−1 H2, respectively. Therefore, the equilibrium desorption temperature at 1 bar pressure is Tdes = ΔH/ΔS = 597 ± 35 °C. The pressure curves of each PCI measurement show that thermodynamic equilibrium was reached for each of the 3 h desorption steps, indicating fast reaction kinetics (Fig. S3, ESI†). The existence of two plateau regions in the PCI measurements is evident from Fig. 7a. The second plateau region is not accurately measured due to (i) zinc evaporation (rate is high at higher temperatures and also depends on time exposed at that temperature) and (ii) limitation of the Sievert's apparatus to achieve very low pressure increments (<1 mbar). The formation of CaZn11 from reaction (5) followed by CaZn5 from reaction (6) during the PCI measurements were confirmed using ex situ XRD. Fig. 8a and b show the XRD patterns of CaH2–3Zn measured at the regions marked as (i) and (ii) in Fig. 7a of the PCI measurement conducted at 600 °C, respectively. Fig. 8a confirmed CaZn11 to be the main phase with only minor CaZn5 peaks present, whereas Fig. 8b shows that all CaZn11 peaks have been replaced with CaZn5 peaks formed during the second equilibrium pressure region. These XRD findings confirm the reactions given above (4)–(6).

Cycling studies
CaH2–3Zn was cycled at 580 °C, which follows the proposed optimized reaction expressed in eqn (5), to assess its H2 cycling capacity and thermochemical reversibility. This temperature was chosen in order to reduce the Zn evaporation rate from the sample. Fig. 9 illustrates the ten H2 desorption and absorption cycles showing good thermochemical reversibility overall. Each desorption and absorption step was 3 and 5 h, respectively. It is evident from Fig. 9 that the kinetics of the desorption reaction are faster than absorption. However, none of the reactions were completed within the allocated step time. The evaporation of Zn from the formed calcium zinc alloy during cycling was also confirmed from the presence of Zn metal deposition on the colder regions of the reactor. Therefore, after the completion of the 10th cycle, 80% of its initial capacity was retained. The cycling capacity of CaH2–3Zn may be enhanced by improving the design of the sample holder so that it can contain the evaporated Zn and also by initially synthesizing with 1:11 molar ratio of CaH2:Zn. This may result in a complete desorption and absorption reaction upon cycling within the allocated waiting times.

Also, it may allow more cycles without degradation as commercial thermochemical storage system requires a cycling reliability of up to 10000 cycles over a 30 year lifespan for CSP plants. An ex situ XRD pattern (Fig. 10) was obtained after the 10th desorption cycle, confirming that CaZn11 was the main crystalline phase present in the decomposed samples, as previously confirmed from TPD, PCT and in situ XRD studies.

Morphological studies
SEM micrographs of CaH2–3Zn before and after cycling are presented in Fig. 11a–c and d–f, respectively. It is evident from Fig. 11a, obtained using backscattered electrons, that CaH2 and Zn are evenly distributed through the sample creating a homogenous powder after ball-milling. No distinctive bright and dark areas were observed in the micrograph that may have been created due to areas with inhomogeneous distributions of particles with excessively different atomic number, as observed in Fig. 11d after cycling is performed. Specifically, the bright areas in Fig. 11d indicated with yellow dashed circles are areas rich in Zn, whereas the dark areas indicated with red circles are Ca rich, as confirmed by their associated EDS spectra (Fig. S4, ESI†). To study the morphological differences before and after cycling, Fig. 11b, c and e, f were obtained using secondary electrons. It can be seen from Fig. 11c and f that the powder particles before and after cycling are relatively the same size and the particles did not sinter or melt upon heating, as often is the case with other metal hydrides at temperatures above 500 °C.2

Cost
A cost comparison of the present system with other destabilized CaH2 systems and a molten salt are listed in Table 1. The cost of the raw material (CaH2–11Zn) is currently estimated as $55 per kW hth,19,40 which is higher than molten salts and other destabilized CaH2 systems, such as Al and Al2O3 while significantly less compared with LiBH4 as shown in Table 1.43,44 However, the CaH2–11Zn system possesses high enthalpy of reaction and relatively low operating pressure at the working temperature (1 bar H2 pressure at ∼600 °C) compared with the CaH2–Al system (62 bar H2 pressure at ∼700 °C).2,41 Overall the high cost, multistep reactions and Zn evaporation issues makes the CaH2–Zn system challenging to use as a commercial thermochemical storage material.

Conclusions
This study has developed a novel approach to thermodynamically destabilize CaH2 by adding low cost Zn metal in a 1:3 molar ratio, and investigate its potential as a TES material for third generation CSP plants. In situ XRD diffraction studies showed the formation of three different calcium zinc alloys, CaZn13, CaZn11 and CaZn5, at 190, 390 and 590 °C, respectively. The enthalpy and entropy of formation of CaH2–11Zn system was found to be ΔHdes = 131 ± 4 kJ mol−1 H2, ΔSdes = 151 ± 4 J K−1 mol−1 H2, respectively. The CaH2–11Zn system's operating condition was found to be 597 ± 35 °C at 1 bar of H2 pressure. Cycling studies of the material over the first step of the reaction show reasonable thermochemical reversibility over 10 cycles. SEM studies before and after cycling confirmed no significant sintering of the sample upon heating. The cost of the raw material was estimated as $55 per kW hth. The destabilization of CaH2 with Zn proves that thermodynamic destabilization can be achieved, but lower cost destabilizing agents must be found. It is challenging to predict the optimal reaction pathways for these destabilization reactions due to unreliable thermodynamic predictions for several reaction products.
