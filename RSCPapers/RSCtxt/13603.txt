    , Accepted 20th December 2017First published on 21st December 2017AbstractFor the first time, small bandgap porphyrin-based polymer acceptors with low-lying frontier energy levels and good crystallinity were developed for application in non-fullerene organic solar cells, in which a broad photoresponse from 300 nm to 1000 nm and an initial PCE of 3.46% have been achieved.
Organic solar cells that use conjugated materials to replace fullerene derivatives as electron acceptors have made rapid progress in recent years, in which power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) have exceeded 13%.1 Versatile material selection, high performance and good device stability enable the non-fullerene organic solar cells (NFOSCs) to have great potential applications in large-area photovoltaic modules.2 Currently, small molecules represent the most successful electron acceptors,3 among which the so called ITIC and its derivatives can realize the highest performance in NFOSCs due to their near-infrared absorption spectra.4 By contrast, the study of polymer acceptors is still lagging behind compared to small molecule acceptors, although lots of non-fullerene conjugated polymers have also been explored for solar cells with PCEs over 9%.5
When designing conjugated materials for solar cells, a broad absorption spectrum from the UV-vis to near-infrared region is vital to achieve high PCEs due to the full coverage of sunlight from 300 nm to 1000 nm.6 Until now, conjugated polymers that have been successfully applied in NFOSCs always contain naphthalene diimide (NDI)7 and perylene bisimide (PBI) units.8 Both of them exhibit strong electron-withdrawing ability and a large π-conjugated backbone, so that the corresponding polymers show deep frontier energy levels and good crystallinity, providing efficient charge separation and transport in solar cells when using other donor polymers. However, PBI-based polymer acceptors always show absorption below 700 nm. NDI-based polymers can extend their absorption to 800 nm, but the absorption coefficient is relatively low. This can be reflected by the low quantum efficiencies in the region of 650–800 nm, limiting the photocurrent and device performance.9 Although some studies attempt to use thiophene-fused NDI to improve the absorption coefficient, the photovoltaic performance was still relatively low.10
We consider that designing near-infrared NDI or PBI-based polymer acceptors is a route to realize high performance polymer–polymer solar cells. In this work, two conjugated polymers based on NDI/PBI and porphyrin were designed with absorption extended to 1000 nm. The idea was prompted by our previous studies, in which star-shaped electron acceptors based on porphyrin as a core and NDI/PBI as end groups were developed to show good performance in NFOSCs.11 The star-shaped molecules have broad absorption from 300 nm to 850 nm, owing to the strong electron-donating porphyrin. Based on these findings, two new conjugated polymers, PPorNDI and PPorPBI that contain porphyrin and NDI/PBI units, were developed and applied in organic solar cells (Fig. 1). Since a large dihedral angle close to 80° will be generated when the phenyl unit is directly attached at the meso-position of porphyrin,12 we then apply ethynyl units as π-bridges in order to eliminate steric hindrance and enhance the intramolecular interaction between porphyrin and NDI/PBI.

The synthetic routes to PPorNDI and PPorPBI are shown in Fig. 1. The monomers ethynyl-porphyrin (M1) with ethylhexyl-thiophene as side chains, dibromo-NDI (M2) with 2-dodecytetradecyl (DT) units, and dibromo-PBI (M3) with swallow-tail C5 chains were synthesized according to the literature.13 The polymers were prepared via typical Sonogashira polymerization, using Pd(PPh3)2Cl2/Pd(PPh3)4 and CuI as catalysts and THF/triethylamine as the solvent. After using acetone, hexane and dichloromethane to remove the possible oligomers and impurities, the polymers could be obtained upon dissolving in chlorobenzene (CB) with small amounts of pyridine (1 vol%).
It is worth mentioning that the polymers show very poor solubility in CB, while the solubility can be significantly enhanced after adding pyridine. It has been observed that pyridine as a ligand was able to incorporate into Zn–porphyrin, resulting in distinct performance in porphyrin-based organic solar cells.13a,14 Therefore, we speculate that the new polymers have strong aggregation tendency in solution due to the large aromatic NDI, PBI and porphyrin, causing bad solubility. Pyridine attached to the z-axis of porphyrin is able to prevent aggregation of the polymers, resulting in good solubility. The molecular weights of the polymers were determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) at 140 °C using o-DCB as the eluent, in which PPorNDI and PPorPBI have the number-average molecular weights (Mn) of 43.9 and 19.5 kDa (Table 1). We found that some of the polymers were insoluble in o-DCB due to the absence of pyridine during measurement, hence the Mn of the polymers could be higher than the measured values.

Absorption coefficient of the polymers in thin films is shown in Fig. 2a. Both the polymers show two distinct absorption spectra in the range of 400–600 nm and 600–1000 nm, with an optical band gap (Eg) of 1.32 eV and 1.24 eV for PPorNDI and PPorPBI. The absorption at 400–600 nm with peaks at around 470 nm is very similar for both polymers, which can be attributed to the sort-band absorption of porphyrin.11a The absorption band in the near-infrared region is related to intramolecular charge transfer between porphyrin and NDI/PBI. The absorption coefficient in the near-infrared region for PPorNDI and PPorPBI is much higher than that of the typical NDI-based polymer N2200,7d which is helpful for light harvesting (Fig. 2a). In addition, PPorPBI shows relatively low absorption coefficient compared to PPorNDI in the near-infrared region, which is possibly due to the reduced orbital interaction between PBI and Por.

Frontier energy levels of the polymer acceptors determined from cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurement are shown in Fig. 2b and Table 1. PPorNDI and PPorPBI have HOMO levels of −5.39 eV and −5.30 eV, and LUMO levels of −4.07 eV and −4.06 eV that were determined from the HOMO levels and Eg. We also use density functional theory (DFT) calculations to study the energy levels and molecular geometry of PPorNDI and PPorPBI, as shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). PPorNDI and PPorPBI exhibit similar HOMO and LUMO levels. PPorNDI shows a coplanar structure, while PPorPBI has a twisted backbone with a dihedral angle of 20° due to the steric hindrance between porphyrin and PBI. This result also confirms that ethynyl units are able to reduce the steric hindrance at the meso-position of porphyrin.
The crystalline properties of the polymers were investigated by grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS), as shown in Fig. 3a–d. The polymer thin films were spin-coated onto Si substrates using CB/1% pyridine as the solvent. We can observe strong (100) diffraction peaks in the in-plane direction and (010) diffraction peaks in the out-of-plane direction, indicating that both polymers exhibit preferentially a “face-on” orientation. The d-spacing of (100) diffraction peaks for PPorNDI is 24.2 Å, while this is reduced to 21.7 Å for PPorPBI (Table S1, ESI†). This is possibly due to the long DT side chains attached to NDI units in PPorNDI. PPorNDI shows a slightly small d-spacing of 3.43 Å in (010) diffraction patterns compared to 3.53 Å in PPorPBI due to the small size of NDI groups (Table S1, ESI†). The good crystallinity of the polymers is originated from the large aromatic units of porphyrin and NDI/PBI, and also ethynyl linkers that are helpful to reduce the steric hindrance between them.

Small bandgaps, low-lying LUMO levels and good crystallinity make PPorNDI and PPorPBI promising electron acceptors in non-fullerene solar cells. Herein, we select the donor polymer PTB7-Th,15 which shows perfectly complementary absorption with the two polymer acceptors (Fig. 2a). NFOSCs were fabricated with an inverted configuration of ITO/ZnO and MoO3/Ag as electrodes. The photoactive layers were solution-processed from CB solution with pyridine as an additive. The pyridine content was found to have little impact on the device performance (Tables S2 and S3, ESI†).
PTB7-Th:PPorNDI (2:1) based cells show an optimized PCE of 1.76% with a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 6.56 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.66 V and a fill factor (FF) of 0.40, while the PCE is boosted to 3.46% for PTB7-Th:PPorPBI based cells due to a high Jsc of 11.22 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.44. Due to the small bandgap, the energy loss (Eloss) calculated as the difference between Eg and eVoc was 0.66 eV and 0.59 eV (Table 2), approaching 0.60 eV as optimized Eloss in organic solar cells.16Jscs of the cells were also reflected by their external quantum efficiencies (EQE) (Fig. 4b). Both of the cells exhibit a broad photoresponse from 300 nm to 1000 nm. PPorPBI-based cells show high EQEs close to 0.4, which is much higher than that of PPorNDI-based cells, explaining its high Jsc.

It is worth discussing the difference in performance between PPorNDI and PPorPBI-based cells. The morphology of blended thin films was studied by atomic force microscopy (AFM), as shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†). PTB7-Th:PPorNDI thin films present large domain size on the surface, while PTB7-Th:PPorPBI thin film has a mixed phase. This can be confirmed by GIWAXS measurement, as shown in Fig. 3e–h. Both blends preferentially exhibit a “face-on” orientation that is similar to the donor polymer PTB7-Th (Fig. S2, ESI†) and the acceptors, but the intensity of (010) diffraction peaks in PTB7-Th:PPorNDI is significantly higher than that in PTB7-Th:PPorPBI. This indicates that the PTB7-Th:PPorNDI thin film has a large crystal domain. The morphology with a large domain will lead to poor exciton diffusion efficiency due to the short exciton lifetime of conjugated materials, resulting in low EQE and Jsc in solar cells. We also measure hole and electron mobilities of solar cells by a space charge limit current (SCLC) method, in which PPorNDI-based cells exhibit unbalanced hole and electron mobilities with a ratio of 0.1 (Fig. S4 and Table S4, ESI†). The unbalanced mobilities in PTB7-Th:PPorNDI cells will enhance charge recombination, partially responsible for the low EQE in solar cells.
Conclusions
Two conjugated polymers that consist of electron-donating porphyrin and electron-withdrawing NDI/PBI were firstly reported as electron acceptors in non-fullerene solar cells. The new polymers exhibit small bandgaps, low-lying LUMO levels and good crystallinity with a “face-on” orientation of the conjugated backbone. Polymer solar cells based on PTB7-Th as electron donors and the new polymers as electron acceptors exhibit a broad photo-response from 300 nm to 1000 nm and an initial PCE of 3.46% was achieved. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report about porphyrin-based polymers as electron acceptors for non-fullerene solar cells. The results demonstrate that it is an efficient route to incorporate strong electron-donating porphyrin into conjugated polymers to realize small bandgap polymer acceptors.
