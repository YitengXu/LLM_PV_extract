Introduction
Energy is an important material foundation of human society. Various energy sources are available, and many new types of energy have begun to meet the needs of human beings through continuous development and research.1–3 During energy utilization, energy needs to be converted or stored according to actual requirements. For instance, solar cells can convert solar energy to electricity and store it, which can solve the strong timeliness problem of the supply and demand of solar energy.4,5 Thus, the energy storage technology is as important as developing new energy sources.
Electrical energy storage,6 electrochemical energy storage,7,8 chemical energy storage,9 and thermal energy storage (TES) are some of the many available approaches for storing energy.10,11 Among them, the TES technology has broad application prospects in solar energy utilization, “peak-load shifting” of electric power, recovery and utilization of waste heat, and energy conservation of building heating. Phase change materials (PCMs) can store and release large amounts of latent heat energy within a slight temperature change through a phase transition, which have the most potential for use in thermal storage. Based on this property, PCMs have been widely researched in thermal management and storage.12–16 Worldwide scholars are committed to introduce other energy conversion media into PCMs and to obtain phase change composite materials with energy conversion and storage functions.
Energy conversion PCMs have attracted considerable attention. To the best of our knowledge, many review articles have summarized composite PCMs, such as PCMs in buildings,17,18 thermal conductivity enhancement PCMs,19,20 carbon-based PCMs,21,22 nanoporous shape-stabilized PCMs,23 and the properties and commercialization of PCMs.24 However, a comprehensive overview of energy conversion PCMs and their conversion mechanism has not been presented. Therefore, we tried to provide a comprehensive perspective of the recent advances in energy conversion PCMs from the perspective of conversion mechanism, including electric-thermal PCMs, electromagnetic-thermal conversion PCMs, photo-thermal conversion PCMs, and photo-thermal conversion PCMs in solar thermoelectric generation. The core of the abovementioned conversions lies in the heat release caused by electron motion or electron transition. The process involved triggering energy conversion at the electronic level. Thus, we classified and named them as electron-triggered energy conversion PCMs. Based on summarizing energy conversion PCMs, this paper aims to deeply understand their electron-triggered energy conversion mechanism, thereby providing a theoretical basis for the construction of efficient energy conversion PCMs and summarizing current issues and future research directions.
2 Electron-triggered energy conversion PCMs
2.1 Electric-thermal conversion PCMs
Considering the insulating properties of PCMs, researchers have focused on designing electrically conductive supporting materials suitable for achieving electric-driven and form-stable phase changes in PCMs. Electric-thermal energy conversion and storage have undoubtedly widened the application scope of PCMs, particularly in the thermal management of electronic devices. The basic mechanism underlying electric-thermal conversion is as follows: moving electrons collide with other molecules or groups to generate Joule heat, which is released when electric current flows through a conductive PCM composite (Fig. 1b).25 The resistive heat is absorbed by the PCMs and is eventually stored as latent heat. The conventional materials used for Joule heating are metals and metal alloys. However, carbon materials, such as carbon nanotubes (CNTs), graphene, and graphite are found to be efficient alternatives.

CNT sponges were first introduced by Zou and Cao's group as porous structures used to encapsulate paraffin via the infiltration method.26 Under an applied voltage bias of 1.75 V, the CNT–paraffin composite achieved an electro-thermal conversion efficiency of 52.5%. In the subsequent study, CNT arrays (CNTA) composed of ordered anisotropic structures were infiltrated with melted n-eicosane (C-20) (Fig. 2a).27 The areal density of the fabricated CNT arrays was modulated by direct lateral compression. The distinctive property of compression increased the alignment and the contact between the PCM and the CNT arrays. Thus, the heat transfer increased, and the bulk resistance decreased in the composites. Consequently, the higher compression (40%) sample required a lower voltage (1 V) to trigger the phase change compared with the uncompressed samples and previously reported CNT sponges with a disordered structure (Fig. 2b). A CNT array-eicosane composite achieved 74.7% electro-thermal conversion efficiency at a voltage bias of 1.3 V. Recently, Aftab et al.28 reported a flexible polyurethane (PU)-CNT composite with an anisotropic structure. The freestanding and macroporous CNT sponge was synthesized via the CVD method. A rectangular sample of CNT sponge was immersed in a DMF solution of PU and later vacuum-dried to obtain a solid–solid PCM composite. The electro-thermal conversion efficiency of the polyurethane PU-CNT composite reached 94% under an applied voltage of 2 V. The shape recovery after the application of 30% strain suggested that the PU-CNTs were sufficiently flexible for device fabrication in biomedical applications.

Graphene aerogels with an anisotropic structure are of great interest in the fabrication of electric-driven PCMs because of their remarkable conductivity and structural stability. Li et al.29 designed an anisotropic graphene aerogel (AN-GA) by employing gaseous HCl to in situ solidify graphene oxide (GO) liquid crystals, followed by chemical reduction, critical drying, and annealing treatments. The thermal and electrical conductivity of the graphene aerogel/paraffin composite was higher in the axial direction compared with the radial direction due to the alignment of the graphene sheets (Fig. 2c and d, respectively). Consequently, the anisotropic PCM composites possessed a fast-response electro-thermal effect and achieved an electro-thermal conversion efficiency of 85.4% at 3 V (Fig. 2e). In another study by Guo et al.,30 the 3D interconnected network of CNTs/GO was infiltrated with PEG-1000. The electro-thermal conversion efficiency of the obtained PCM composite was approximately 70% under 6.6 V, which was reduced to 63% under a higher voltage (7.0 V) due to convection heat loss to the air. In a study by Zhou et al.,31 a hybrid halloysite nanotube/graphene aerogel supporting skeleton was fabricated and infiltrated with PU. The halloysite nanotubes improved the reduction degree of the graphene aerogel and the latent heat storage of PCM composites through the heterogeneous nucleation effect. However, the electro-thermal conversion efficiency of the PCM composite was 66.3% under 10 V. The abovementioned studies clearly show that the anisotropic structure of CNTs and graphene-supported PCM composites are contributing factors to high electric-thermal conversion efficiency.
Some cheap carbon materials also have electric-thermal properties. Maleki and Beitollahi32 prepared a 3D interconnected porous carbon foam from polyacrylonitrile that could load organic PCMs and presented high electric-thermal efficiency (up to 74%).
Graphite foams are widely used supporting skeletons for loading PCMs due to their ordered porous structure, high conductivity, low density, and cost effectiveness. Zou's group reported a systematic study on the performance of electric-driven PU as a solid–solid PCM embedded in graphite foam. In their study, PU was synthesized via infiltration in graphite foam, and a later study involved the in situ PU polymerization within the graphite foam.33 The results of both studies showed the electric-thermal conversion efficiency of PU/graphite foam composites of approximately 80–85% at 1.2–1.8 V. Another study also achieved a significantly reduced supercooling degree in a PU solid–solid PCM.34 In addition, the application of a functional protective wear for cold environments was demonstrated by embedding the electric-driven PU/graphite foam composite (15 cm × 10 cm × 2 cm) in a winter coat (Fig. 2f and g). According to the test results, the heat discharging was prolonged two times more in functional wear than in normal wear after battery-assisted charging. Thus, the electric-driven PCM provided satisfactory protection against cold by keeping the temperature in the comfort range for a long period of time.
Porous carbon derived from biomass sources are reported as efficient supporting materials for encapsulating PCMs. The sustainable raw materials, impressive thermophysical properties, and high absorption capacity of porous carbon can be utilized in large-scale PCM applications, such as building materials. Li et al.35 prepared a carbon aerogel via the hydrothermal carbonization of water melons, and paraffin was infiltrated to obtain a PCM composite with an electrical conductivity of 3.4 S m−1 and electric-thermal conversion efficiency of 71% at 15 V.
The working voltage and efficiency are two key factors of electric-thermal conversion PCMs. Hence, while maintaining high electric-thermal conversion efficiency, reducing the working voltage to improve their application security will be the focus of attention in the future.
2.2 Electromagnetic-thermal conversion PCMs
Periodic electron motion (alternating current) can produce alternating magnetic fields (AMF), in which superparamagnetic materials can release heat through Néel relaxation or Brownian relaxation (Fig. 1a).36,37 Based on this property of superparamagnetic materials, researchers have combined these materials with PCMs to prepare electromagnetic-thermal conversion PCMs.
Nano Fe3O4 is the most common electromagnetic-thermal filler.38–40 Wang et al.41 introduced a Fe3O4-functionalized graphene nanosheets (Fe3O4–GNS) into a PU PCM. Fe3O4–GNS endowed the Fe3O4–GNS/PCM with magnetic and sunlight dual-driven energy conversion and storage performances (Fig. 3a). Fe3O4–GNS/PCM could convert magnetic energy to thermal energy and store it through phase transition under AMF because of the superparamagnetism of the Fe3O4 nanoparticles (Fig. 3b). A high additive amount of Fe3O4–GNS resulted in a high heating rate. In addition, the magnetic-thermal energy storage efficiencies increased from 18.7% to 41.7% with an increase in the Fe3O4–GNS content (Fig. 3c). In another study, Fan et al.42 prepared an SiO2 gel network to load polyethylene glycol (PEG) and Fe3O4 nanoparticles through the in situ sol–gel method. The prepared Fe3O4/PEG/SiO2 composites exhibited shape stability, electromagnetic-thermal conversion, and phase change energy storage performances simultaneously.

PCMs, due to their relatively stable temperature during the phase change, have been regarded as ideal medium materials in the medical field, such as thermotherapy and drug release systems. Thus, the electromagnetic-thermal conversion of PCMs is mainly applied in the fields of magnetic thermotherapy and magnetically triggered drug delivery. In addition, when electromagnetic-thermal conversion PCMs are applied in human disease treatment, the most important aspect is to regulate the phase change temperature in the range of 41–47 °C, which can release drugs or kill pathological cells without causing irreversible damage to normal cells.43
Wang et al.43 designed an extracorporeal magnetic thermotherapy material (Fe3O4@SiO2/PCM) by introducing superparamagnetic Fe3O4@SiO2 core–shell colloids into a phase change matrix (Fig. 4a). The Fe3O4@SiO2/PCM could be driven in AMF and maintained a temperature range of 41–47 °C for a long time (Fig. 4b). The temperature control efficiency of Fe3O4@SiO2/PCM reached up to 60.2%.

Ghosh and co-workers44 capped Fe3O4 magnetic nanoparticles with oleic acid (OA) or PEG and explored their magnetic hyperthermia applications in cancer therapy. They discovered that human breast cancer cells showed a 35% decrease in viability after Fe3O4-OA treatment compared with the untreated control.
Electromagnetic-thermal conversion PCMs can be utilized in drug delivery by using an external magnetic field to control the release of drugs in the body to achieve accurate drug delivery. Zhang et al.45 reported a new drug release system consisting of Fe3O4 nanoparticles, 1-tetradecanol (PCM), PEG, and doxorubicin (DOX). The Fe3O4@PCM/PEG/DOX system achieved nearly zero release in body temperature and could be driven by both NIR laser irradiation and AMF. Under AMF, the Fe3O4 nanoparticles rapidly underwent electromagnetic-thermal transformation. When the temperature reached the phase change temperature, the drug was released. Meanwhile, due to the phase change properties of the PCM, the system temperature was guaranteed to be within 42 °C during release, which does not damage the human body.
Li et al.46 developed an anticancer drug delivery system for thermo-chemotherapy based on PCM and hollow magnetic nanoparticles (HMNPs). HMNP@PCM@DOX could quickly generate heat under AMF and reached the temperature for cancer hyperthermia (>42 °C) within 30 min (Fig. 4c). The tumor temperature in mice increased in vivo after treatment (Fig. 4d). Simultaneously, anticancer drugs were released during hyperthermia. Combined with hyperthermia and chemotherapy, the tumor experiment in mice proved that the thermo-chemotherapy method of this system had an obvious inhibitory effect on tumors (Fig. 4e).
It is evident from these works that electromagnetic-thermal conversion PCMs have great application prospects for drug release and thermotherapy. However, further research is needed on the targeted therapy and toxicity of electromagnetic-thermal conversion PCMs.
2.3 Photo-thermal conversion PCMs
Among the various energy sources, solar energy is identified as one of the most potential renewable energy sources because it is abundant, universal, sustainable, and clean.47,48 Therefore, photo-thermal conversion PCMs are the most frequently studied among the energy conversion PCMs. The basic mechanism of photo-thermal conversion is that light can excite photo-thermal fillers, thereby making electrons jump to the excited state. Then, the excited electrons will release energy back to the ground state by nonradiative relaxation, energy transfer, or quenching.49,50 All of the above relaxation modes are accompanied by heat release (Fig. 1c). Table 1 shows the thermal properties and photo-thermal performances of representative photo-thermal conversion PCMs with various photo-thermal fillers, and more details will be discussed later in this review.

The key factor of photo-thermal conversion PCMs is the photoabsorber and converter. Dyes are a potential and outstanding photoabsorbers and converters. In recent years, our group conducted several studies and synthesized a series of light-driven dye-PCMs.51–55 Our group also pioneered the introduction of dyes into PCMs to prepare photo-thermal PCMs. Three dyes containing chlorosulfonyl or active chlorine and functionalized MPEG were linked through polyethylene polyamine and formed organic photo-thermal conversion materials (OPTCM).55 The dyes and PCMs are reactive agents of composites and act as light capture and thermal energy storage modules, respectively (Fig. 5a). The photo-thermal conversion mechanism was also conjectured. The dye molecules absorb photons and reach the excited state. Then, they rapidly transition to the ground state by the thermal release approach (nonradiative relaxation), including vibration relaxation, internal conversion, and intersystem crossing (Fig. 5b). The photo-thermal conversion and storage efficiency (η) can be close to 94%. Furthermore, we polymerized a dye and PEG to form a polymer skeleton (dye-PU) and then loaded hexadecanol to obtain a form-stable light-driven phase change composite with high latent heat.52 Hexadecanol/dye-PU composites have high phase change enthalpies (Fig. 5c) and photo-thermal conversion properties due to the phase transition properties and light absorption capacity of their supporting skeleton. Furthermore, no leakage is observed above the phase change temperature (Fig. 5d) because of the excellent supporting characteristics of dye-PU.

Carbon materials, especially nanocarbon materials, are usually chosen as the photo absorber and converter because of their strong light absorption, physical properties, and very high thermal conductivity.21 Carbon materials release heat mainly through the electron phonon coupling mechanism.
A. Kardam and co-workers56 utilized nanographite (NG) and CNT as nanofillers to for a composite with inorganic PCM Mg(NO3)2·6H2O and investigated its heat transfer rate and solar harvesting properties through a solar water heating experiment (Fig. 6a). The experimental observations showed that the system with the NG–PCM composite reached a high temperature much faster than that with the pristine PCM (Fig. 6b). This condition was attributed to the fast thermal diffusion of the uniformly dispersed nanocarbon materials. Furthermore, the authors found that CNTs performed better than NGs in harvesting, converting, and storing the broad spectrum solar energy. Their good light absorption is believed to stem from the van Hove transitions within or between the π-bands of CNTs.

Zhou et al.57 prepared crosslinked PU-based PCMs with reduced graphene oxide (RGPCMs) using GO and PEG as working parts and hexamethylene diisocyanate biuret (HDIB) as a crosslinking agent. Thus, GO sheets reacted with HDIB to form a crosslinking network and were reduced simultaneously. The advantage of this strategy is that the final products will form 3D crosslinking networks regardless of the RGO content. The RGO could serve as a crosslinking skeleton at high content and act as crosslinking knots at low content (Fig. 6c). The fantastic structure not only endowed the RGPCMs with an excellent form-stable performance but also outstanding photo-thermal conversion properties. The temperature of the RGPCMs increased rapidly under solar radiation due to the excellent light absorbing property of RGO. In addition, the photo-thermal conversion properties were proportional to the RGO content (Fig. 6d). The photo-thermal conversion and storage efficiency (η) of the RGPCMs reached 78.7% with 9.1 wt% RGO.
Our group58–60 reported a series of nano-carbon containing light-driven PCMs. In one of our studies, carbon fiber (CF) was utilized as a light-driven filler and introduced to a PEG/silica (SiO2) system through a sol–gel process.58 The absorption properties of CF and CF/PEG/SiO2 were investigated through solid ultraviolet-visible absorption measurement. CF demonstrated high absorption at all visible light bands. Thus, the CF/PEG/SiO2 composites had enhanced visible-light absorption in proportion to the CF content.
Furthermore, some carbon materials can be used as supporting materials to obtain form-stable PCMs due to their porous or layer structures.
Akhiani and his group61 reduced and functionalized GO with long chain alkylamine and oleylamine and then formed a 3D structure via self-assembly with palmitic acid (PA) (Fig. 7a). Compared with pure PA, the composites showed better performance in the light-to-heat conversion. Yang's group62 reported a 3D hierarchical graphene foam and used it to support paraffin, and the obtained composite exhibited high photo-thermal energy conversion and a storage efficiency of 89%.

Carbon aerogels (CA) are a type of lightweight, porous, amorphous carbon nanocomposites. Their 3D porous structure make them a potential support framework for solid–liquid PCMs.63–65 Huang et al.65 designed a CA/octadecanol composite PCM and investigated its shape-stability mechanism and photo-thermal conversion performance. The CA was synthesized from glucose via sol–gel and carbonization. The SEM image of CA displays that interconnected nanoparticles form a highly porous aerogel (Fig. 7c), and the N2 absorption and desorption isotherms further prove the presence of micro-porosity and macro-porosity (Fig. 7b). After octadecanol infiltration, the rough nanoparticles were wrapped by octadecanol, and their pores were filled (Fig. 7d). The carbon aerogels also endowed the composites with excellent light absorption. When CA/octadecanol was exposed to simulated light, the composite absorbed solar energy. Thus, its temperature increased and reached the phase change platform (Fig. 7e), whereas pure octadecanol could not reach its phase change temperature and realize solar energy storage due to its lack of light absorption.
Nevertheless, light absorption capacity and thermal radiation determine the photo-thermal utilization efficiency. Although carbon materials have high light absorption capacity, their high emissivity values (usually over 0.8)66 lead to a low photo-thermal utilization efficiency.67,68 Thus, further improving the photo-thermal utilization efficiency of photo-thermal conversion PCMs is still a research hotspot.
Further improvement of the light absorption ability of carbon materials is an effective solution. Some metal nanoparticles can enhance thermal generation by localized surface plasmon resonances (LSPR) because they have many mobile electrons for the conversion of heat. The LSPR is a unique optical phenomenon that occurs in some metallic structures, such as silver, gold, and platinum. When the frequency of incident light and oscillation frequency of delocalized electrons in metals are consistent, collective excitation leads to remarkable heating.50 According to this mechanism, researchers have introduced metal nanoparticles into carbon materials to increase their photo-thermal conversion efficiency. Zhang et al.69 designed a novel enhanced photo-thermal conversion composite by introducing Ag nanoparticle-functionalized graphene nanosheets (Ag–GNS) into PEG (Fig. 8a). Based on the LSPR effect of the Ag nanoparticles, the composites exhibited improved photo-thermal and energy storage efficiency from 70.8% to 92.0% (Fig. 8b). Deng and Tao's group found a new magnetically moving way to increase the energy harvesting efficiency from the perspective of the heat transfer mechanism.70,71 In one of their studies, they introduced Fe3O4@graphene optical absorbers into a paraffin system and accelerated the heat transfer through the dynamic tuning distribution of Fe3O4@graphene with a magnetic field (Fig. 8c(iii)).70 Compared with the traditional photo-thermal conversion heat transfer approaches, as shown in Fig. 8c(i) and (ii), the charging rate increased by 60% and 270%. The energy harvesting efficiency also increased by 64.3%.

Some metal oxides are also applicable photo-thermal fillers. Ti4O7/PEG/SiO2 form-stable PCMs have been developed by Tang and coworkers to improve the utilization efficiency of solar energy.72 They reported that the Ti4O7/PEG/SiO2 composites had wide solar radiation absorption capacity and could effectively harvest visible light. Li et al.73 designed new paraffin@ SiO2/Ti4O7 microcapsules, which exhibited a photo-thermal storage efficiency of 85.36% with 3 wt% Ti4O7. In another work, Ni et al.74 used Cu–Cu2O as shell materials to coat phase change paraffin wax to prepare a new type of heat transfer fluid with photo-thermal properties. The effective receiver efficiency of the paraffin@Cu–Cu2O slurry reached over 90% at 40 °C.
Besides, an increasing number of new photo-thermal conversion PCMs with excellent properties have been discovered. Recent studies have found that as a new material, MXenes are also an excellent photo-thermal conversion agent, and their large specific surface area and two-dimensional structure can directly bind PCMs to overcome the leakage problem. The photo-thermal storage efficiency can reach 94.2%.75
Photo-thermal-electric conversion is a further application of photo-thermal conversion PCMs. Using the Seebeck effect of the thermoelectric module, the heat energy converted from light through photo-thermal PCMs can be further transformed into electrical energy. Furthermore, based on the phase change characteristic of photo-thermal PCMs, a stable output current in a period of time can be obtained.
Zhang et al.76 reported a graphene–PCM composite based on 3D graphene foams and paraffin wax. With the combination of photo-thermal conversion and heat storage capability, the graphene–wax composite was applied in a light-driven thermoelectric conversion system and realized sustained power generation (Fig. 9a–d). In addition, a small fan could be driven by the light-driven thermoelectric conversion system under 1500 W m−2 light irradiation, and the fan continued to run for 10 min after the light source was turned off (Fig. 9e). Our group77 designed and constructed a sunlight-driven thermoelectric system using a photo-thermal PCM (PCHSM) as the hot-side and a phase change cool storage material (PCCSM) as the cold-side to control the temperature (Fig. 9f). The temperature gradient was controlled through the hot and cold-side materials based on their phase change characteristics, and a stable output current was obtained under sunlight (Fig. 9g). In addition, based on several previous works, we studied the photo-thermal conversion mechanism of dye-PCMs using femtosecond transient absorption.77 The dye molecules were excited by light. However, the excited state was not stable. Thus, the dye molecules went back to the ground state, and the energy was transferred to the polymer chain by intramolecular energy transfer. Then, the polymer chain released excess energy in the form of heat through molecule vibrations (Fig. 9f).

Yang and his group synthesized a series of photo-thermal phase change composites containing PEG, boron nitride (BN), and GO or graphene and then applied them in photo-thermal-electric conversion.78–81 Under the action of the phase change composites, stable output currents and voltages could be both obtained during the stage of energy storage and energy release.
Therefore, photo-thermal-electric energy conversion expands the applications of photo-thermal PCMs, especially in the field of solar thermoelectric generation. Besides improving the optical capture and photo-thermal conversion performance of photo-thermal PCMs, the improvement of their thermoelectric efficiency and processability of their thermoelectric module is also crucial.
3. Conclusion and outlook
In conclusion, we presented a detailed review on the current development of different electronic-trigger energy conversion PCMs, including electric-thermal PCMs, electromagnetic-thermal conversion PCMs, photo-thermal conversion PCMs, and photo-thermal conversion PCMs in solar thermoelectric generation. In particular, the electronic-trigger energy conversion mechanisms summarized herein can make it easy for readers to deeply understand the theory of energy conversion PCMs and improve the energy conversion efficiency from the mechanism.
In our opinion, several critical issues and research directions worthy of further investigation are as follows:
• From the point of view of the electron collision mechanism, electric-thermal conversion PCMs need electric conductivity to allow electron flow and require resistance to generate Joule heat. The key is finding the best balance point to safely obtain low-voltage drive and high energy conversion efficiency.
• Electromagnetic-thermal PCMs, which are of great significance in curing diseases and overcoming medical problems, such as magnetic thermotherapy and magnetically triggered drug delivery, can be used in human biotics. This aspect is a meaningful research direction. The magnetic moment, size of magnetic particles and targeted therapy are important issues requiring further study.
• For photo-thermal PCMs, carbon-containing PCMs are the most commonly used. To solve the low efficiency of carbon-containing PCMs, introducing metal particles with LSPR effects to increase their light absorption or change their heat transfer mode is a very sensible approach. However, studies on this aspect are few despite its meaningful research direction. This topic is also a worthy research direction to explore more new photo-thermal fillers.
• For photo-thermal-electric energy conversion, in addition to the abovementioned improvement of the properties of photo-thermal PCMs, improving the performance of the thermoelectric component and reducing the heat loss between modules are important research directions. In addition, flexibility and portability of the system are important issues that need to be addressed.
In summary, the development of multifunctional energy conversion PCMs is still popular and meaningful research. Further efforts should be made to improve the properties and efficiencies and expand the application of energy conversion PCMs.
