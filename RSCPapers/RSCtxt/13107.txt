    , Accepted 13th September 2013First published on 17th September 2013AbstractA composite film of titanium disulfide/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (TiS2/PEDOT:PSS) was deposited on a indium-doped tin oxide (ITO) conducting substrate by the drop coating technique, as the counter electrode (CE) of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). TiS2 particles were well distributed in the polymer matrix of PEDOT:PSS and served as an electrocatalyst material for the redox reaction of iodide/triiodide ions (I−/I3−) with high conductivity and attractive catalytic ability. The TiS2/PEDOT:PSS composite CE showed good uniformity and provided a large electrochemical surface area, which resulted in a high cell efficiency (η) of 7.04%. The high efficiency of the cell with the TiS2/PEDOT:PSS composite CE could be a potential choice for replacing the expensive Pt CE. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) were used to characterize the morphology of different CEs, including Pt, bare TiS2, bare PEDOT:PSS and the TiS2/PEDOT:PSS composite. The catalytic ability and electrochemical properties of the CEs were quantified by cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), Tafel plots and rotating disk electrode (RDE) measurements. The high cell efficiency of DSSCs with the TiS2/PEDOT:PSS composite CE was verified by the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) curves.
Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), as a new type of next-generation renewable power source, confronted several challenges, such as increasing the cell conversion efficiency (η), reducing the production cost, and pursuing large-scale production. To replace expensive and rare platinum (Pt) as a catalytic material of the counter electrodes (CEs) in DSSCs,1–3 several substitute materials have been widely investigated, such as conducting polymers,4–6 carbon-based materials7–9 and transition metal compounds.10–12 Recently, transition metal compounds have been reported to exhibit high electrical conductivity and outstanding electrocatalytic activity for I3− reduction. Some of them were abundant, low-cost and easy to fabricate. It has been reported that transition metal carbides (TMCs), nitrides (TMNs), sulfides (TMSs), selenides (TMSes), phosphides (TMPs) and oxides (TMOs) are the potential catalysts to replace the Pt CE in DSSCs.10
According to the reports listed in Table 1,11–36 titanium compounds, such as titanium nitride (TiN) and titanium carbide (TiC), showed outstanding ability for collecting electrons and regenerating the I−/I3− redox couple. Jiang et al. first synthesized TiN nanotubes as the CEs and a 7.73% cell efficiency was observed, which is comparable to the typical Pt CE (η = 7.45%).11 Li et al. fabricated a composite CE, containing carbon nanotubes and TiN nanoparticles, and achieved a 5.41% efficiency.12 Zhang et al. synthesized TiN nanospheres to form the CE of DSSCs, with a high open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 759 mV and a cell efficiency of 7.83%.13 In 2012, researchers found that the TiC thin film CE can not only work with the I−/I3− redox couple,14 but also with the cobalt redox couple,15 which provided 6.46% and 4.13% cell conversion efficiencies, respectively. Moreover, titanium-based composites, such as ordered mesoporous TiN/carbon,16 were also reported as good substitutes to replace the Pt CE, and achieved attractive cell efficiencies of around 6–8%. In addition, sulfide compounds as the catalytic materials of CEs have also achieved good performance in DSSCs. Hu et al. first introduced FeS and FeS2 nanosheet thin film CEs, which reached 1.32% and 0.93% cell efficiencies, respectively.17 Wu et al. prepared MoS2 and WS2 CEs and obtained high cell efficiencies of 7.59% and 7.73%, respectively.18 Sun et al. applied NiS CEs and obtained an attractive cell efficiency of 6.83%.19 Xin et al. synthesized CuZnSnS and CuZnSnSe semiconductors, which were usually used in heterojunction tandem solar cells; these achieved 3.62% and 7.37% efficiencies, respectively.20 An increasing number of sulfide or selenide compounds have been proposed as CEs in DSSCs, including CoS nanorod arrays,21 Co0.85Se,22 Ni0.85Se,22 CuInS2/ZnS composite nanorods23 and FeS2 nanocrystals,24 all of which showed high catalytic ability with reasonable cell efficiencies. Ku et al. even applied NiS in a brand new electrolyte featuring the thiolate/disulfide redox couple, and achieved an impressive 6.25% cell efficiency, which was much better than that of the Pt CE for this redox couple (3.98%).25 Furthermore, the conducing polymer, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) or PEDOT:PSS, can be used with various titanium-based, sulfide-based and/or carbon-based particles to achieve a high cell efficiency; these include TiN nanoparticles/PEDOT:PSS,26 TiN nanorods/PEDOT:PSS,27 TiC/PEDOT:PSS,28 TiO2/PEDOT:PSS,29 CoS/PEDOT:PSS,30 CuInS2/PEDOT:PSS,31 graphene/PEDOT:PSS,32 carbon black/PEDOT:PSS,33,34 carbon fiber/PEDOT:PSS,35 multi-walled carbon nanotubes/PEDOT:PSS (MWCNTs/PEDOT:PSS),36etc.

Titanium disulfide (TiS2), which has a high electrical conductivity37 and has been applied in various electronic devices, such as lithium batteries,38–42 hydrogen storage43 and stamp-transferable electrodes,44 was chosen as the catalytic material in this study. According to the reports mentioned above, TiS2 has not been explored as a potential material for the reduction reaction of I−/I3− on the CE in DSSCs. We incorporated a conducing polymer, PEDOT:PSS, which acts as a perfect binder among the TiS2 particles and as a linker between the TiS2 particles and the substrate. PEDOT:PSS provides a conducting polymer matrix to facilitate electron transfer. We studied the TiS2/PEDOT:PSS composite thin film as an alternative low-cost catalytic material to replace the conventional Pt CE. Table 1 reports the cell efficiency of DSSCs made with the TiS2/PEDOT:PSS composite CEs in this study, as well as those of DSSCs based on transition metal compounds and composite-based CEs mentioned in the literature.
Experimental
Materials
Titanium(IV) tetraisopropoxide (TTIP, >98%), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, ≥99.5%), ethanol (EtOH, 99.5%), isopropyl alcohol (IPA, 99.5%), lithium perchlorate (LiClO4, ≥98.0%), titanium disulfide (TiS2), Nafion® solution, 2-methoxyethanol (≥99.5%), 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide (BMII), tetrabutylammoniumtriiodide (TBAI3, >97%) and 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate (EMIBF4) were obtained from Sigma Aldrich. Lithium iodide (LiI, synthetic grade), iodine (I2, synthetic grade) and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG, Mw ∼ 20000) were obtained from Merck. Acetone (99+%), 4-tert-butylpyridine (tBP, 96%), and tert-butyl alcohol (tBA, 96%) were obtained from Acros. 3-Methoxypropionitrile (MPN, 99%) was obtained from Fluka. 1,2-Dimethyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide (DMPII) and cis-diisothiocyanato-bis(2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylato) ruthenium(II) bis(tetrabutylammonium) (N719 dye) were obtained from Solaronix (S.A., Aubonne, Switzerland). Acetonitrile (ACN, 99.99%) and nitric acid (HNO3, 65% solution in water) were obtained from J. T. Baker. PEDOT:PSS aqueous solution (PH 500, 1.0–1.4 wt% dispersion in water) was obtained from Heraeus.
Preparation of the various CEs
Indium-doped tin oxide (ITO, 10 Ω sq−1, UR-ITO007-0.7 mm, Uni-onward Corp., Taiwan) and fluorine-doped SnO2 (FTO, TEC-7, 7 Ω sq−1, NSG America, Inc., New Jersey, USA) conducting glasses were first cleaned with a neutral cleaner and then washed with deionized water, acetone and isopropanol sequentially. The standard Pt CE was prepared by DC sputtering on an ITO substrate with a thickness of 30 nm. The bare TiS2 CE was prepared by drop-coating the bare TiS2 slurry, which contained 10 wt% TiS2 powder in ethanol, at 60 °C onto the ITO. The bare PEDOT:PSS CE was prepared by drop-coating the bare PEDOT:PSS slurry, which contained 47.5% PEDOT:PSS and 2.5% DMSO in ethanol, at 60 °C onto the ITO. According to our previous work,26,45 the TiS2/PEDOT:PSS composite CEs were prepared by drop-coating the composite slurries onto the ITO at 60 °C. The composite slurries were composed of 5 to 15 wt% TiS2 powder in PEDOT:PSS solution, which contained 47.5% PEDOT:PSS and 2.5% DMSO in ethanol.
Fabrication of the DSSCs
A TiO2 colloid was formed by adding 0.5 M TTIP in 0.1 M nitric acid aqueous solution with constant stirring and heating to 88 °C for 8 h, and sequentially heating to 240 °C for 12 h in an autoclave (PARR 4540, USA). The TiO2 paste for the transparent layer (TL) was concentrated from the TiO2 colloid to 8 wt% and 2 wt% of PEG was added. The other TiO2 paste for the scattering layer (SL) was obtained by adding 8 wt% commercial light scattering TiO2 particles (ST-41, 200 nm, Ishihara Sangyo, Ltd, Japan) into the TL paste. The FTO conducting surface was first treated by spin-coating a 100 nm compact layer with a solution containing 25 wt% TTIP in 2-methoxyethanol. A 20 μm porous TiO2 film containing a 15 μm TL and a 5 μm SL was coated onto the treated FTO glass by the doctor blade technique, and the TiO2 film was sintered at 500 °C for 30 min in an air atmosphere. After the sintering process, the TiO2 photoanode was controlled at an active area of 0.16 cm2, and immersed in 5 × 10−4 M N719 dye solution at room temperature for 24 h. The N719 dye was dissolved in ACN and tBA (volume ratio of 1:1) as a standard dye solution. The TiO2 photoanode was coupled with the CE and the distance between these two electrodes was fixed and sealed by heating a 60 μm thick Surlyn® resin (SX1170-60, Solaronix S.A., Aubonne, Switzerland). The electrolyte, which contained 0.1 M LiI, 0.6 M DMPII, 0.05 M I2 and 0.5 M TBP in MPN and ACN (volume ratio = 1:1), was injected into the gap between these two electrodes by capillarity. For the further investigation of the long-term stability of the DSSCs with different CEs, the binary ionic liquid-based electrolyte composed of 0.2 M I2 and 0.5 M TBP was added in a mixture of BMII and EMIBF4 (volume ratio = 65:35). The ionic liquid-based electrolyte penetrated slowly into the gap between the photoanode and the CE through the electrolyte-injecting hole, which was previously made in the counter electrode with a drilling machine, and the hole was sealed with hot-melt glue after the completion of filling by the electrolyte.
Characterization of the CEs and DSSCs
The surface morphologies of the Pt, bare TiS2, bare PEDOT:PSS and TiS2/PEDOT:PSS composite CEs were observed by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, Nova NanoSEM 230, FEI, Oregon, USA). The surface roughness and the composition of the TiS2/PEDOT:PSS composite CE was observed by atomic force microscopy (AFM, Park Systems XE70) and energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX, Horiba, 7021-H). The catalytic abilities of the CEs for the I−/I3− redox couple and the electrochemical properties can be estimated through cyclic voltammetry (CV) and rotating disk electrode (RDE) measurements, Tafel plots and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). CV was performed with a three-electrode electrochemical system in an ACN solution containing 10 mM LiI, 1.0 mM I2 and 0.1 M LiClO4. The Pt, bare TiS2, bare PEDOT:PSS or the TiS2/PEDOT:PSS composite films were used as the working electrodes, and the Pt foil and Ag/Ag+ electrode were used as the counter and reference electrodes, respectively. The RDE measurements were obtained using a potentiostat (model 900B, CH Instruments) equipped with a modulated speed rotator (MSR, PINE Instrument Company) in an ACN-based electrolyte containing 0.1 M LiClO4 and 1.0 mM TBAI3. The glassy carbon electrode (GCE, Part # AFE7R9GCGC, PINE Instrument Company) was coated with various catalytic materials, including Pt, bare TiS2, bare PEDOT:PSS and the TiS2/PEDOT:PSS composite films, and served as the working electrodes. A Pt wire and an Ag/Ag+ electrode were employed as the counter and reference electrodes, respectively. The rotating speeds were controlled at 50, 100, 200, 600 and 800 rpm. Tafel plots and EIS spectra of symmetric cells of the various CEs were obtained by a potentiostat/galvanostat (PGSTAT 30, Autolab, Eco-Chemie, Utrecht, the Netherlands) equipped with an FRA2 module.
The cell conversion efficiency (η) of the DSSCs with different CEs was measured by the potentiostat/galvanostat under 100 mW cm−2 light illumination by a class A quality solar simulator (XES-301S, AM1.5G, San-Ei Electric Co., Ltd, Osaka, Japan) without using a mask, and the incident light intensity was calibrated with a standard Si cell (PECSI01, Peccell Technologies, Inc., Kanagawa, Japan). The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) curves of the DSSCs were obtained by the potentiostat/galvanostat and a class A quality solar simulator (PEC-L11, AM1.5G, Peccell Technologies, Inc., Kanagawa, Japan) equipped with a monochromator (model 74100, Oriel Instrument, California, USA). The incident radiation flux (φ) was obtained using an optical detector (model 71580, Oriel Instrument, California, USA) and a power meter (model 70310, Oriel Instrument, California, USA).
Results and discussion
Morphology

Fig. 1 shows the FE-SEM images of the top view of various CEs, including Pt, bare TiS2, bare PEDOT:PSS and the TiS2/PEDOT:PSS composite films. It can be observed from Fig. 1a that the Pt film is very flat and covered by small and uniform Pt particles. Fig. 1b shows a bare TiS2 film composed of flaky TiS2 particles with sizes of about 1 μm, which gives poor linkage between the TiS2 particles and a weak contact with the ITO. The bare PEDOT:PSS film is very smooth and compact, as shown in Fig. 1c, which implies an unfavorable electrochemical surface area, thus limiting the penetration of the electrolyte. Fig. 1d shows the flat morphology of PEDOT:PSS at higher resolution. After using TiS2 particles and PEDOT:PSS to prepare the composite slurry, the TiS2/PEDOT:PSS slurry was well dispersed and formed an uniform composite film with high roughness and a large active surface area, as shown in Fig. 1e, which indicates that the TiS2/PEDOT:PSS composite CE can effectively reduce the charge transfer resistance at the CE/electrolyte interface. The cross-sectional FE-SEM images of the various CEs are shown in Fig. S1, ESI.† Fig. S1† reveals that all of the deposited catalytic films have a good contact with the ITO substrates. Fig. S1† also shows the film thicknesses for Pt, bare TiS2, bare PEDOT:PSS and the TiS2/PEDOT:PSS composite films of 30 nm, 32 μm, 3 μm and 30 μm, respectively.

To further investigate the uniformity of the TiS2 particles and the surface roughness of the TiS2/PEDOT:PSS composite films, high-resolution EDX and non-contact mode AFM analysis were employed. From the corresponding elemental maps of Ti from the EDX analysis shown in Fig. 2a and b, it can be seen that the TiS2 particles were well spread and showed good uniformity on the TiS2/PEDOT:PSS composite film. The uniformly distributed TiS2 particles could facilitate electron transfer in the composite film. From the AFM images shown in Fig. 2c and d, the roughnesses of bare PEDOT:PSS and TiS2/PEDOT:PSS are 45 and 378 nm, respectively. The higher roughness of the TiS2/PEDOT:PSS composite thin films could give a larger active surface area and more electrocatalytic active sites. Therefore, the TiS2/PEDOT:PSS composite thin film could provide a rough surface for I3− reduction and less resistance for charge transfer.

Optimization and characterization of the TiS2/PEDOT:PSS composite CEs
The TiS2/PEDOT:PSS composite films were modified by adding different weight percentages (wt%) of TiS2 particles, from 5 to 15 wt%. The CV measurements shown in Fig. 3 reveal that the electrocatalytic ability of bare PEDOT:PSS can be improved by the addition of TiS2 particles. However, the electrocatalytic ability of the TiS2/PEDOT:PSS composite films for the I−/I3− redox reaction does not vary with the weight percentage of TiS2 particles. Fig. 4 shows the photovoltaic performance of the DSSCs with bare PEDOT:PSS and the various TiS2/PEDOT:PSS composite films. As shown in Fig. 4a, the TiS2/PEDOT:PSS composite CEs generally provide a higher open-circuit voltage (VOC) than those of the bare TiS2 and bare PEDOT:PSS CEs. More TiS2 particles results in higher electrocatalytic ability and conductivity but a lesser contact to the ITO substrate. The short-circuit current density (JSC) and fill factor (FF) were optimized at 15.78 mA cm−2 and 0.66 respectively, by increasing the amount of TiS2 particles to 10 wt%.

The cell efficiency was improved to a maximum value of 7.04%. The corresponding photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 2. The maximum of the IPCE spectra shown in Fig. 4b is elevated from 52% to 63% at 520 nm by increasing the amount of TiS2 particles from 0 to 10 wt%, which agrees well with the JSC values obtained from the J–V curves.

Electrochemical analysis of the various CEs
The electrocatalytic ability, the intrinsic heterogeneous rate constant (k0) and the effective catalytic surface area (Ae) for the various CEs can be obtained from the CV and RDE measurements. Fig. 5 shows the CV curves of the Pt, bare TiS2, bare PEDOT:PSS and 10 wt% TiS2/PEDOT:PSS CEs. For the I−/I3− redox couple, the major electrochemical reduction at the CE can be represented as: I3− + 2e− → 3I−.(1)
 Fig. 5  (a) CVs of the various CEs, with an electrolyte of 10 mM LiI, 1 mM I2 and 0.1 M LiClO4 in ACN, (b) long-term stability of the 10 wt% TiS2/PEDOT:PSS composite CE from 10 to 100 scan cycles. 
In Fig. 5a, the 10 wt% TiS2/PEDOT:PSS composite CE shows a higher redox current density than that of the bare PEDOT:PSS and bare TiS2 CEs, which implies that the TiS2/PEDOT:PSS composite CE possesses better electrocatalytic activity for reduction of the I3− ions. After 100 scan cycles in the I−/I3− redox electrolyte, the TiS2/PEDOT:PSS composite CE still maintains high cycling stability, as shown in Fig. 5b.
Rotating disk electrode (RDE) experiments can simultaneously offer information on two important parameters, namely the catalytic activity and the active surface area. The intrinsic heterogeneous rate constant (k0) and the effective catalytic surface area (Ae) for the reduction of I3− can be obtained from the linear sweep voltammetric (LSV) curves of the coated GCEs with different rotating rates (50, 100, 200, 600 and 800 rpm). The corresponding reciprocal currents (i−1) can be obtained from the LSV curves at the formal potential (E0) for each coated GCE. Therefore, the original Koutecký–Levich equation can be simplified as eqn (2). The corresponding reciprocal currents (i−1) vs. the reciprocal of the root of the rotating rate (ω−1/2) plots for each coated GCEs were fitted linearly, from which, the intercept and slope of these fitting lines can be used to find k0 and Ae, respectively, by using the modified Koutecký–Levich equation46 shown below: (2)where i is the current obtained from the LSV curve at the formal potential (E0), n is the number of electrons transferred, F is the Faraday constant, C is the concentration of I3− (1.0 mM), D is the diffusion coefficient of I3− (3.62 × 10−6 cm2 s−1), ν is the kinematic viscosity of ACN and ω is the angular velocity converted from the rotating speed.
In the RDE plots shown in Fig. 6, k0 and Ae of the various CEs were obtained from the intercepts and slopes of the fitting lines, respectively. However, Fig. 6 does not show the data for the bare TiS2 CE because of the poor adhesion between the TiS2 particles and the GCE. The value of k0 for the Pt, bare PEDOT:PSS and 10 wt% TiS2/PEDOT:PSS CEs are 3.23 × 10−3, 1.57 × 10−3 and 1.79 × 10−3 cm s−1, respectively. The higher k0 means a higher kinetic catalytic ability for I3− reduction. The values of Ae for Pt, bare PEDOT:PSS and 10 wt% TiS2/PEDOT:PSS CEs are 0.20, 0.27 and 0.32 cm2, respectively. The TiS2/PEDOT:PSS composite CE showed a comparable intrinsic heterogeneous rate constant, and a higher effective catalytic surface area than the Pt CE, which indicates a comparable reduction rate of I3− ions to that of Pt. These results agree well with the AFM images and CV curves.

Tafel polarization curves, as shown in Fig. 7, were used to study the interfacial charge transfer properties of the symmetric cells based on the various CEs, including Pt, bare TiS2, bare PEDOT:PSS and the TiS2/PEDOT:PSS composite films. The exchange current density (J0) can be calculated from the intercept of the linear fitting lines from the cathodic and anodic polarization curves. The charge transfer resistance (Rct) for the various CEs can be calculated by eqn (3):46 (3)
 Fig. 7  Tafel polarization curves for the various CEs. 
From eqn (3), the higher the value of J0, the smaller the value of Rct. The Rct values obtained from the Tafel polarization curves are summarized in Table 3. It can be observed that the bare TiS2 CE shows the highest Rct of 85.24 Ω cm2. Since the linkage among the TiS2 particles is poor and the contact between the bare TiS2 CE and the ITO substrate is very weak, the bare TiS2 CE gave the largest Rct value among the CEs. The bare PEDOT:PSS CE provides better adhesion to the ITO substrate and enhances the charge transfer ability, and a smaller Rct value of 9.06 Ω cm2 can be obtained. The composite film combines the advantages of both bare TiS2 and bare PEDOT:PSS. The TiS2 particles in the composite film provide faster charge transfer, giving a comparable Rct value of 4.39 Ω cm2, with reference to that of the Pt CE (2.91 Ω cm2).

The EIS spectra of symmetric cells based on the various CEs are shown in Fig. 8. The impedance properties of the various CEs, including the series resistance (Rs) and charge transfer resistance (Rct), were obtained by fitting the equivalent circuit shown in the inset of Fig. 8. The Rs can be estimated from the onset point of the equivalent circuit, and the Rct can be calculated from the radius of the first corresponding semicircle. In Table 3, the TiS2/PEDOT:PSS composite CE improves the linkage among the TiS2 particles, as well as the adhesion between the TiS2 particles and the ITO substrate, leading to improved charge transfer at the ITO substrate/composite electrode interface with a slightly lower Rs value of 15.78 Ω cm2, compared to the bare TiS2 CE (16.12 Ω cm2). On the other hand, the Rct for bare TiS2 can not be obtained from the EIS measurements because the linkage among the TiS2 particles is very weak and fragile. However, the TiS2/PEDOT:PSS CE gives a smaller Rct of 4.78 Ω cm2 with reference to that of the bare PEDOT:PSS CE (7.27 Ω cm2); this is attributed to the enhancement of the electrical conductivity and catalytic ability due to the presence of the TiS2 particles. Thus, the TiS2/PEDOT:PSS composite CE shows comparable charge transfer ability as compared to the Pt CE (3.02 Ω cm2), which can be ascribed to the higher active surface area of the film, as judged by the value of Ae obtained from the RDE measurements. In either case, the Rct values for the various CEs obtained from the EIS spectra agree well with the values calculated from the Tafel plots. The Rct for the 10 wt% TiS2/PEDOT:PSS composite is smaller than that for both the bare TiS2 and PEDOT:PSS CEs.

Photovoltaic performance and IPCE spectra of the DSSCs with various CEs
The photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the DSSCs with the various CEs are shown in Fig. 9a. The bare TiS2 CE reached a cell conversion efficiency of 3.24%, VOC of 565 mV, JSC of 11.27 mA cm−2 and FF of 0.51. The bare TiS2 CE can provide good electrocatalytic ability and high electrical conductivity, leading to a reasonably good JSC and FF. However, the weak linkage among the TiS2 particles would reduce the electron transfer and result in a poor VOC and cell efficiency. The bare PEDOT:PSS CE gives a cell efficiency of 3.91%, VOC of 664 mV, JSC of 12.74 mA cm−2 and FF of 0.46. Although the bare PEDOT:PSS CE provides better adhesion to the ITO substrate and offers a higher VOC and JSC, its poor conductivity and unfavorable electrochemical surface limits the JSC value and results in a lower FF. The TiS2/PEDOT:PSS composite CE containing 10 wt% TiS2 particles combines the advantages of both the bare TiS2 and bare PEDOT:PSS CEs, which eventually achieved a cell efficiency of 7.04% and a higher VOC, FF and JSC, as seen in Table 2. These results agree well with the AFM, CV, RDE, Tafel and EIS analyses mentioned above. From the AFM measurements, the TiS2/PEDOT:PSS composite CE shows a higher surface roughness, which provides larger surface area for electrocatalytic I3− reduction, thus enhancing the JSC value in the DSSCs. From the CV and RDE measurements, the higher redox current density, larger intrinsic heterogeneous rate constant (k0), and larger effective surface area (Ae) of the TiS2/PEDOT:PSS composite CE results in the higher JSC value of the DSSCs. From the Tafel and EIS analyses, the smaller series resistance (Rs) and charge transfer resistance (Rct) values of the TiS2/PEDOT:PSS composite CE would lead to faster electron transfer kinetics in the cell and higher JSC and FF values of the DSSCs.
 Fig. 9  (a) Photocurrent density–voltage curves of the DSSCs with the various CEs, measured at a 100 mW cm−2 (AM 1.5G) light intensity, (b) IPCE curves of the DSSCs with the various CEs. 
To further explain the change of the VOC value, the dark current density characteristics of the DSSCs with the various CEs were collected and are shown in Fig. S2, ESI.† In Fig. S2,† the onsets of the dark currents of the DSSCs with the various CEs, including Pt, bare TiS2, bare PEDOT:PSS and the TiS2/PEDOT:PSS composite, occur at 625, 347, 570 and 613 mV, respectively. These values were obtained from the intersection points of the two fitting lines: one point is the tangent to the curve starting from the voltage scale; the other is the zero-current line. The onset of the dark current of the DSSC with the TiS2/PEDOT:PSS composite CE occurs at a higher forward bias of 613 mV than for the DSSCs with the bare TiS2 and bare PEDOT:PSS CEs. From this, the addition of TiS2 to PEDOT:PSS, to form the TiS2/PEDOT:PSS composite CE, can enhance the intrinsic heterogeneous rate constant (k0) and the effective surface area (Ae) for faster I3− reduction,26 which facilitates the suppression of the electron recombination reaction with I3−. Moreover, the addition of TiS2 to PEDOT:PSS can directly reduce the values of Rs and Rct, which were obtained from the EIS measurements, for better charge transfer in the cell.
The IPCE spectra for the various CEs are shown in Fig. 9b, which agree well with the JSC values obtained from the J–V curves. The TiS2/PEDOT:PSS CE composite containing 10 wt% TiS2 particles provides a higher IPCE value of 63% at 520 nm, showing a comparable IPCE value to the Pt CE (68%). The higher cell performance and IPCE value for the TiS2/PEDOT:PSS composite CE can be explained by the comparable catalytic ability towards I3− reduction with reference to that of sputtered Pt CE (7.65%), in support of the TiS2/PEDOT:PSS composite CE acting as a potential CE material to replace Pt.
Durability of the DSSCs with the Pt and 10 wt% TiS2/PEDOT:PSS composite CEs in an ionic liquid-based electrolyte
The long-term durability measurements of the DSSCs with the Pt and TiS2/PEDOT:PSS composite CEs containing 10 wt% TiS2 particles were performed in a binary ionic liquid electrolyte, which can prevent the efficiency loss caused by the vaporization of the ACN-based liquid electrolyte. The at-rest long-term durability data on the cell efficiency of DSSCs were measured each day over a period of one month. In Fig. S3, ESI,† the DSSC with the 10 wt% TiS2/PEDOT:PSS composite CE shows rather good long-term durability over a period of one month, revealing that the TiS2/PEDOT:PSS composite is a stable CE material for DSSCs.
Conclusions
A novel TiS2/PEDOT:PSS composite counter electrode was prepared by using the simple drop-coating method. The attractive electrochemical properties and photovoltaic parameters of DSSCs with a TiS2/PEDOT:PSS counter electrode, as compared to those with either bare TiS2 or bare PEDOT:PSS CEs, are attributed to the better electrocatalytic activity of the TiS2 particles and good adherence of the PEDOT:PSS matrix to the ITO substrate. The TiS2/PEDOT:PSS composite counter electrode provides an interesting intrinsic heterogeneous rate constant of 1.79 × 10−3 cm s−1 and a significantly larger active surface area (1.6 times higher than that of Pt), suggesting the TiS2/PEDOT:PSS composite counter electrode could be a promising substitute for the expensive Pt counter electrode. Consequently, several advantages, such as low-cost fabrication, the possibility of large-scale production, and high cell efficiency, can be achieved by applying the TiS2/PEDOT:PSS composite counter electrode in DSSCs.
