Both oligomers undergo two reversible, sequential oxidation processes (10a: E1½

Sexithiophene 10a has been incorporated as an electron donor material, with C60 as acceptor, in a bilayer photovoltaic device. The power conversion efficiency is a modest 0.12%, whilst the maximum IPCE at 350 nm gave an external quantum efficiency of ca. 12%.IntroductionPolythiophene and its many variants have been studied extensively for their use in numerous applications, such as electroluminescence,1 photovoltaics,2 field effect transistors,3 electrochromics4 and sensors.5 The electronic properties of these materials rely on the effective conjugation length within the polymers and thereby depend heavily on the degree of planarity in the main chain and the number of undesirable α–β′ links between repeat units. Well-defined oligothiophenes are also of high interest as electronic materials6 and offer several advantages over analogous polymeric materials: (i) monodispersity, (ii) a precise structure with no isomeric impurities, (iii) high chemical stability, (iv) good solubility, (v) direct processability from solution or by vacuum deposition techniques. Moreover, these attributes allow a direct and unequivocal correlation between structure and electronic properties and there is wide coverage in the literature focussing on morphological, electronic and spectroelectrochemical aspects of neutral and charged oligothiophenes.7Recently, we have reported the synthesis, electropolymerisation and characterisation of some 3′,4′-bis(alkylsulfanyl)terthiophenes (A–D).8 Our main interest in this work was the significance of the ethylenedithiothiophene (EDTT) unit, which is a direct and underexplored analogue of the well-known EDOT unit. Indeed, poly(EDOT) and poly(EDTT) possess very different electronic characteristics, yet the latter has a greater potential for interchain interactions due to the increased number of sulfur atoms in the chain. From this viewpoint, the role of EDTT in polythiophene materials is highly interesting in terms of electronic and charge transport properties, as well as self-assembly and film morphology. To this end, we have synthesised the end-capped sexithiophenes 10a and 10b in order to gain a closer understanding of the electronic contribution of the EDTT unit and its effect upon the structure of the oligomer and morphology of the bulk material.  Results and discussionSynthesisThe preparation of alkylterthiophenes 9a and 9b
					(Scheme 1) followed a similar strategy used to prepare terthiophenes A–D.8,9 In this case, vinylene trithiocarbonate 3 was reacted with one equivalent of LDA to obtain the organolithio intermediate, which was subsequently reacted with 5-methylthiophene-2-carbaldehyde and 2 to give the corresponding alcohols 4a and 4b as racemic mixtures (91 and 87%, respectively). The aldehyde 2 was prepared simply from 2-hexylthiophene 1 by lithiation with n-butyllithium followed by addition of DMF. Further treatment of alcohols 4a,b with two equivalents of LDA and 2-thiophenecarbaldehyde afforded compounds 5a and 5b. 4,5-Bis(2-arylhydroxymethyl)-1,3-dithiole-2-thiones are unstable and undergo various rearrangement pathways,10 therefore diols 5a and 5b were reacted almost immediately with MnO2 to give the stable diketone products 6a and 6b
					(75% overall yield from 4a,b in both cases). The thiocarbonyl derivatives were converted to their oxone analogues by treatment with mercuric acetate (7a, 85%; 7b, 82%), before these compounds were cyclised to the corresponding thiophenes using phosphorus pentasulfide (8a, 69%; 8b, 75%). Alkylation of the dithiole-one species was accomplished by the action of sodium ethoxide, releasing the dithiolate intermediate, followed by the addition of 1,2-dibromoethane (9a, 76%; 9b, 67%). Finally, the sexithiophene oligomers 10a and 10b were prepared by reacting the terthiophenes 9a,b with ferric chloride in chloroform and the materials were isolated in 50 and 40% yields, respectively.

ElectrochemistryThe redox properties of the sexithiophene derivatives have been studied in solution and as thin films on ITO glass. The cyclic voltammogram of compound 9a shows a single irreversible oxidation wave at +1.00 V (Fig. 1) corresponding to the redox process 9a
					→
					9a+˙. A small reduction peak is observed at +0.60 V, which is probably due to the emergence of a dimerised product (10a) at the working electrode. In contrast, the sexithiophene derivatives 10a and 10b display two sequential quasi-reversible oxidation processes leading to radical cation and dication species, respectively (10a: E1½
					=
					+0.61 V, ΔEa−c
					= 100 mV; E2½
					=
					+0.97 V, ΔEa−c
					= 50 mV; 10b: E1½
					=
					+0.70 V, ΔEa−c
					= 50 mV; E2½
					=
					+0.91 V, ΔEa−c
					= 160 mV). A film of the methyl substituted sexithiophene was deposited by spin coating onto ITO glass and the solid-state voltammogram of 10a is depicted in Fig. 2. The reversibility of the redox processes is diminished due to the self-assembly and charge trapping in the solid state. The first oxidation peak is shifted to a more positive value by 0.24 V to +0.90 V, whilst the corresponding reduction process remains unchanged at +0.56 V. The second oxidation wave is less affected in the solid state (E2½
					=
					+0.95 V) but the difference between the oxidation and reduction peaks is increased to 170 mV. There was no evidence of coupling reactions during repetitive cycling experiments, indicating that the alkyl groups are successful in inhibiting any polymerisation processes. In contrast to the solid state CV of dimethyl sexithiophene (DMSxT, which is analogous to 10a but without the ethylene dithio substituents), 10a shows good reversibility, although the oxidation peaks of DMSxT are very similar (+0.91 and +1.05 V, vs. Ag/AgCl).11 In the negative scan, we observed a quasi-reversible reduction wave at −1.74 V (ΔEc−a
					= 100 mV). The difference between the onset of the first oxidation and reduction waves gives an estimate of the electrochemical band gap of the material and this was found to be 2.20 eV. Fig. 1  Cyclic voltammograms of compounds 9a

Fig. 2  Cyclic voltammogram of compound 10a as a spin-coated film on ITO glass, under identical conditions to those presented in Fig. 1. Absorption studies/spectroelectrochemistryIn contrast to the electrochemical behaviour of the two sexithiophene derivatives, the absorption spectra of the materials in solution are identical. Fig. 3 shows the spectra for compounds 9a and 10a in solution (dichloromethane) and for 10a also in the solid state. The absorption maximum for the terthiophene unit appears at 373 nm, which is slightly higher than that for compound C
					(368 nm)8 and in the range expected for an additional alkyl group appended to the parent terthiophene. This peak is shifted bathochromically by 84 nm (λmax 457 nm) in 10a due to the elongation of the conjugated chain. In comparison, the absorption maximum for DMSxT in solution is 438 nm12 and unsubstituted sexithiophene (α-6T) has a value of 432 nm.13 The difference in values of λmax between DMSxT and 10a is due to the electronic contribution of the alkyl sulfanyl groups and this effect is also observed for tris(butylsulfanyl)sexithiophene 11
					(λmax 449 nm, CHCl3).14  The optical band gap of the material can be deduced from the longest wavelength absorption edge. The absorption peak for 10a is particularly sharp for a conjugated system and the band edge (536 nm) equates to a value of Eg
					= 2.3 eV. In the solid state, the absorption maximum is further shifted to 477 nm (Eg
					= 2.15 eV), as a function of interchain interactions in the solid.15 The optical band gaps are in excellent agreement with the electrochemical measurement for Eg. In the solid-state spectrum of 10b
					(Fig. 3(b)), the absorption peak shows greater complexity than that of 10a
					(maxima at 481, 510 and 551 nm), indicative of some higher ordering due to the hexyl chains. The spectrum is essentially unchanged after annealing at 100 °C for 1 h. The shoulder of the longest wavelength absorption peak is extremely broad and covers several hundred nm, making it difficult to assign the optical band gap for 10b in the solid state. The same behaviour is observed for poly(C) and poly(D).8 Fig. 3  Absorption spectra of (a) compounds 9a

						() as a film on ITO glass, and (b) compound 10b as a film on ITO glass. Spectroelectrochemical (SEC) measurements in acetonitrile were conducted for both sexithiophene derivatives as thin films drop cast on ITO glass (Fig. 4). Here it is worth noting that the drop-cast films gave absorption spectra more reminiscent of the solution state experiments rather than the spin-coated films. Above +0.85 V two additional peaks emerge at 651 and >1100 nm for compound 10a and these continue to grow up to +1.40 V, which is just beyond the second oxidation process for the material. Since the oxidation of 10a surpasses the dication threshold, these peaks should be characteristic of the evolution of a bipolaronic species. The oxidation peaks could be sufficiently close together (+0.90 and +1.03 V) to bypass the experimental detection of the intermediate polaron (10a+˙). However, in the spectroelectrochemical characterisation of DMSxT, peaks arising at 685 (π-dimer association) and 860 nm (radical cation) were assigned to the signature of DMSxT+˙.11 Similar conclusions have been made from experiments on methoxyoligothiophene analogues.16 For compound 10b, similar absorption peaks are observed for the bipolaron at 631 and >1100 nm, although above +1.25 V we observed a rapid decrease in peak intensity due to the dissolution of the material into the solvent. Compared to simple oligothiophenes such as DMSxT and 11, the absorption bands for oligomers 10a and 10b at significantly longer wavelengths (860 vs. >1100 nm, corresponding to the polaronic species) indicate a more delocalised charged state and significant electronic contribution from the ethylenedithio units.

Photophysical studies and photovoltaic propertiesPhotoinduced charge transfer between conjugated polymers/oligomers and fullerene is of considerable interest for photovoltaic energy conversion.17–24 Photoinduced absorption studies have been carried out on photovoltaic devices based on 10a as a donor, with C60 as the acceptor. Fig. 5 shows the PL spectrum of pristine 10a with a maximum at 650 nm (1.9 eV) using an excitation wavelength of 476 nm. It is seen that the relatively strong PL of 10a is significantly quenched by blending of 10a with C60. This quenching can be related to the photoinduced charge transfer from 10a excited state to C60. Fig. 5
					(inset) shows the PL and absorption spectra of 10a with the onset of absorption at 570 nm. Fig. 5  Photoluminescence spectra in blends of 10a and C60

Fig. 6 displays the photoinduced absorption (PIA) spectrum of pristine 10a and a co-evaporated film of 10a:C60. The photoinduced absorption spectrum for the pure oligomer exhibits two peaks; these features can be assigned to a charged species (polaronic state) at 0.7 and 1.5 eV. The high energy band at 1.5 eV possibly has an additional contribution from triplet–triplet absorption shifting the spectrum to higher energies. The PIA signals of the co-evaporated film exhibit two peaks at 0.73 and 1.4 eV. These peaks can be attributed to the photoexcited positive polaron species without the additional feature of a triplet. The PIA band centred at 1.12 eV corresponds to the absorption of the C60− radical anion22,23 due to intermolecular charge separation, which is necessary for solar energy conversion.25 Fig. 6  Photoinduced absorption spectra of mixed layer 10a:C60

Under white light illumination at 100 mW cm−2, through the ITO electrode, an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.27 V and a short circuit current (Isc) of 1.14 mA cm−2 have been measured. Using these data, a filling factor (FF) of 0.4 and a power conversion efficiency of 0.12% were calculated. Fig. 8 shows the photocurrent spectrum of the photovoltaic cell and compares the absorption spectra of pristine 10a and C60 films. The spectrum shows the maximum incident photon to collected electron (IPCE) at 350 nm with an external quantum efficiency about 12%, which is comparable to other oligomer/C60 blends.26,27 In order to maximise the photocurrent, further optimisation of the device structure will be necessary.

ExperimentalGeneralMelting points were taken using a Stuart Scientific SMP1 Melting Point apparatus and are uncorrected. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian Unity Innova instrument at 300 and 75 MHz, respectively; chemical shifts are given in ppm; all J values are in Hz. IR spectra for the characterisation of the compounds were recorded on a ATI Mattson Genesis Series FTIR spectrometer. Mass spectra (EI) and high resolution mass spectra were recorded on Micromass Trio 2000 and Kratos Concept spectrometers, respectively. Elemental analyses were obtained on a Carlo Erba Instruments EA1108 elemental analyser. Absorption spectra were measured on a Unicam UV 300 spectrophotometer.All CV and spectroelectrochemical measurements were performed on a CH Instruments 660A Electrochemical Workstation with iR compensation, using anhydrous CH2Cl2 or acetonitrile as the solvent, aqueous Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode and platinum wire and gold disk (or ITO glass for SEC) as the counter and working electrodes, respectively. All solutions were degassed (Ar) and, where relevant, contained the substrate in concentrations ca. 10−3 M, together with n-Bu4NPF6
					(0.1 M) as the supporting electrolyte. Under these conditions, the redox potential for the FcH/FcH+ couple was +0.48 V (CH2Cl2, vs. Ag/AgCl).The photoluminescence (PL) and photoinduced absorption (PIA) spectra were measured using an excitation Ar+ laser at 476 nm. The changes in sample transmission ΔT resulting from the mechanically chopped laser pump beam were detected with a Si/InGaAsSb detector and using a lock-in-amplifier (typical chopping frequency was 73 Hz). ΔT were corrected for the sample luminescence and normalised by the sample transmission T to obtain the PIA (ΔT/T) spectrum. PIA and PL measurements of co-evaporated films of 10a and C60 were carried out at 18 K. Photovoltaic cells were produced as a bilayer heterostructure of 10a/C60 using thermal evaporation. This active bilayer was deposited on PEDOT:PSS coated ITO substrates. Aluminium (Al) was used as the top electrode. The thickness of the active layer was varied between 40 and 150 nm. Current–voltage characteristics of photovoltaic cells were measured in the dark and under illumination with 100 mW cm−2
					(1.5 AM) from a solar simulator. Incident photon to collected electron (IPCE) was measured with monochromatic light from a Xe lamp and detected by a lock-in-amplifier.5-Hexylthiophene-2-carbaldehyde (2)To a solution of 2-hexylthiophene 1
