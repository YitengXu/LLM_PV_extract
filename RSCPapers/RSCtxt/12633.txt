    , Accepted 26th April 2016First published on 12th May 2016AbstractA p-type dye-sensitized solar cell, where the dye injects a hole into the semiconductor, could be combined with a typical Grätzel cell to create an efficient tandem device. However, the current p-type devices suffer from low efficiency. Here, geometries and electronic structures of four perylenemonoimide-based dyes (1–4) both as free and adsorbed on the NiO(100) semiconductor surface have been investigated to gain a better understanding of the p-type devices. In particular, the electronic transitions relevant to charge transfer between the dye and the surface have been identified. Excitations have been evaluated using the time-dependent DFT calculations, and the roles of frontier orbitals and band edges in transitions have been assessed. The adsorbed dyes can adopt either upright or slightly tilted geometries depending on the structure of the anchoring group and the binding mode of the dye. The adsorption slightly lowers the NiO band gap, from 4.06 eV to 3.90–3.96 eV, depending on the surface–adsorbate system and the band gaps of the dye molecules by 0.1–0.2 eV. Additionally, the adsorption mode of dye 1 moves the LUMO+1 level down by 0.5 eV. The effective mass of charge carrier holes is significantly smaller at the NiO surface than in the bulk indicating the importance of surface conductivity. We also found that the potential drop, i.e. the driving force for charge transfer from NiO to the dye molecule, depends on the adsorption mode of 1.
1. Introduction
Photovoltaics is one of the fastest growing technologies for generating renewable energy. Silicon-based solar cells, although widely used, are still costly.1 Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) offer attractive alternatives as inexpensive and light-weight devices, which perform well also in diffuse sunlight.1,2 The currently known DSSCs are, however, less efficient than the silicon solar cells.3 The n-type DSSCs, discovered in 1991 and known as Grätzel cells, have been studied the most.4 The p-type DSSCs have been studied much less, most probably because they have lower power conversion efficiencies (PCEs). For comparison, the PCEs of n-type DSSCs have reached 12–13%5,6 whereas those of p-type DSSCs are presently 0.5–2.5%.2,7–9
The fact worthy of attention about n- and p-type DSSCs is that they can be incorporated into a tandem cell (i.e. a p–n-DSSC). The tandem construction enables collecting the sunlight in a wider spectral range and produce a larger open circuit voltage (Voc) compared to either n- or p-type DSSC alone. The theoretical maximum PCE of a tandem cell is over 40%10 while that of a single-junction silicon solar cell is 29%,11 which makes the structure of a tandem-DSSC ideal to be pursued. The components of a p–n-DSSC are the n- and p-type dyes, two semiconductors (e.g. NiO and TiO2), and the electrolyte (e.g. I−/I3−), which are connected in series in a circuit. Although the Voc increases in a p–n-DSSC, the current flow through the cell is limited by the weakest performing component which is the p-type side of the cell.12–14 Because of the low PCEs of the p-DSSCs an efficient p–n-DSSC is not yet realized.
A p-DSSC functions complementary to the n-DSSC. When the dye molecule in a p-DSSC is excited, typically the excitation is followed by an electron transfer to the acceptor part of the dye further away from the semiconductor surface. Next, the hole left behind can transfer to the semiconductor. The electron on the acceptor part of the dye transfers to the electrolyte. Several p-type dyes have been experimentally studied in p-type DSSCs including perylene monoimide (PMI) derivatives in this study.2,6–9,15 Typical dye-related problems have been linked to both the properties of orbitals (their locations and energy levels) and the (other) fast charge transfer reactions competing with the intended charge transfer from the dye molecule to the semiconductor.16,17 The most preferable dyes in general are of donor–acceptor (D–A) type because they can be modified by synthetic means to reach the desirable electron transfer routes. In the D–A systems light excites the electron in the donor to be transferred to the acceptor. This separation of charges makes the recombination slower.18 It is desirable that the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of the dye has a spatial overlap with the orbitals that make the valence band of the semiconductor to facilitate the hole transfer from the dye to the semiconductor.3 Moreover, in p-DSSCs the valence bands of the semiconductor should be located energetically above the HOMO of the dye molecule in order to enable a fluent charge flow. The anchor group is also important especially if the anchor unit is conjugated throughout from the donor down to the surface, as conjugation may increase the charge transfer.
Experimental studies have indicated that NiO is not the most optimal choice for a semiconductor carrier of p-type dyes because of its shallow valence band and low mobility of the holes.3 However, the other alternatives reported so far, such as copper(II) oxide (CuO) and copper(I) aluminum oxide (delafossite CuAlO2),19–21 have lower photocurrents than NiO which leaves NiO the best choice at present. However, changing the redox mediator from I−/I3− into the FeIII/II or CoIII/II complex greatly enhances the open circuit voltage up to 645 mV9 or 709 mV,22 respectively. Different electrode materials such as fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) or platinum23 have been tested, as well. Furthermore, the experimental studies of p-type dyes3,17 indicate that the competing electron transfer reactions are fast compared to the current generating electron transfer in p-type DSSCs, meaning that recombination may take place before the charge reaches the semiconductor and the current flow is hindered. Besides, it is not yet known, if the mobility of charge carriers is higher at the surface or in the bulk of NiO.
The properties of the NiO semiconductor are challenging to calculate, starting from the band gap. Experimental and theoretical band gaps of the NiO(100) surface are reviewed in Table S1 (ESI†). We are aware of previous modeling studies, in which dye molecules, coumarin,24 porphyrin,25 diketopyrrolopyrrole derivatives,26 and ruthenium complexes27 on the NiO(100) surface have been examined. Additionally, one of the dye molecules studied in this article has been previously examined in vacuum at the PBE/6-31G(d) level of theory.15
The aim of this work has been to gain a better atomic level understanding of the p-type devices. We have determined the minimum energy geometries and the electronic structures of four PMI-based, p-type donor–acceptor (D–A) dyes and studied their interactions with the NiO(100) semiconductor surface.7,12,14 Additionally, we have determined the energy levels relevant to the electronic excitations and charge transfer reactions. Because NiO is known to be ionic and it has an antiferromagnetic (AF2) order, we have taken spin-polarization into account in the calculations.28,29
2. Computational models and methods
2.1 Models

Free dye molecules. 
Molecular models of four p-type perylenemonoimide-based (PMI) donor–acceptor dyes are visualized in Fig. 1. In model 1, the oligothiophenetriphenylamine (TPA) moiety acts as a donor and PMI acts as an acceptor. In the other three models, PMI acts as a donor and one of the following three moieties can act as an acceptor: naphthalene diimide without a phenyl bridge (NDI) in 2, naphthalene diimide with a phenyl bridge (PhNDI) in 3, and fullerene with a phenyl bridge (PhC60) in 4.

Semiconductor. 
The rock salt crystal structure of the p-type28 NiO semiconductor with the cubic lattice constant a0 of 4.176 Å30 was used to construct the defect-free periodic 3D model of NiO. Typically a primitive unit cell containing two atoms is enough for optimization of the rock salt crystal structure. However, because the antiferromagnetism was taken into account, a supercell containing two Ni and two O atoms was used for the optimization of the lattice constant yielding an a0 of 4.213 Å. The model of the NiO(100) surface (Fig. 2a), a 2D slab, was cut out from the optimized, periodic NiO bulk model as a four (4) layer thick 4 × 4 supercell. We choose to utilize the (100) surface because it is known to be the most stable and therefore most abundant of the NiO surfaces. Other surfaces like (110) or (111) tend to facet to surfaces containing (100) planes in order to minimize the surface energy, if not stabilized by defects or polar liquids or other external effects.31 The center-to-center distance of the 2D slabs was 500 Å in the “nonperiodic” direction. All atoms of the surface model (4 × 4 supercell) were relaxed while keeping the lattice vector frozen at the optimized bulk value of 16.852 Å. The orientations of the spins in the surface model are visualized in Fig. 2b.

Dye molecule adsorbed on the surface. 
First, the carboxyl groups of the dyes were chemisorbed on the four (4) layers thick NiO(100) surface slab. The acid groups are deprotonated in chemisorption and the released protons are bound to oxygen atoms of the NiO surface. Dye 1 (Fig. 1) has two carboxyl groups which allow the anchoring via either one or both carboxylate groups onto the NiO surface. Dyes 2–4 (Fig. 1) have only one carboxyl group each enabling anchoring onto the NiO surface (Fig. 3c–e). The systems, i.e. carboxyl groups chemisorbed on the NiO surface, were relaxed to reach the minimum energy structures while keeping the lattice vectors frozen. Second, the rest of the dye molecules were added and covalently bound to the anchor groups and relaxed, see Fig. 3. The geometries of 3 and 4 turned out to be more challenging to optimize than those of 1 and 2. However, because the donor unit is the same in dyes 2–4 (Fig. 1 and 3) and the carboxyphenoxy anchor is the same in combined systems 2 and 3 (Fig. 3), we will be able to infer some expected behavior for the combined systems 3 and 4. Additionally, models for examining dye–dye interactions were made based on the combined model. For these, the surface in the combined model was removed and the dye geometry relaxed while keeping the lattice vectors frozen.

2.2 Methods
Preliminary optimization with DFT and the subsequent time-dependent DFT (TDDFT) calculations of the free dye molecules in vacuum were carried out using the Gaussian 09 program.32 The global hybrid functional, B3LYP,33–35 and the 6-31(d) basis set were used to optimize the ground state geometries and to calculate the vibrational frequencies using DFT and the electronic transitions between the ground and excited states using TDDFT. The absence of imaginary frequencies ensured minimum energy structures. Molecular orbital energies and electronic excitations were calculated in order to examine the possible charge transfer properties.
The free, pre-optimized dye molecules, the separate NiO bulk and the NiO(100) surface, as well as the combined ‘dye adsorbed on the NiO(100)’ system were studied with DFT using the CRYSTAL0936,37 program. The B3LYP functional was used also in these calculations. The TZVP38 basis set was chosen for molecule 1, 6-31G(d,p)39 for molecules 2–4, and basis sets with contractions 86411/6411/41 and 8411/41140 for surface Ni and O, respectively. Because NiO is antiferromagnetic, special convergence and spin-related tools were used for its modeling (for further details, see ESI†).
The effective hole masses, (1)were calculated for the hole transport properties and compared with the experimental value of 0.8m0.41 The term m* is inversely proportional to the hole mobility. In Eqn (1), E(k) is the band energy as a function of wave vector k in the band (see Fig. 7) and ℏ is the reduced Planck constant.
We also calculated the adsorption energies, Eads = ED/NiO − ED − ENiO(2)where ED/NiO is the energy of the combined system, ED is the energy of a single dye molecule and ENiO is the energy of the NiO(100) surface.
3. Results and discussion
Free dye molecules
The molecular orbitals of the free dyes were examined to gain a better understanding of the intramolecular excitations for the charge transfer processes. The UV-Vis spectra of the dye molecules are presented in Fig. 4 and the corresponding excitations in Table 1. The calculated gaps between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), i.e. the HOMO–LUMO gaps of the dyes, are 2.5 eV for 1, 1.9 eV for 2, 1.8 eV for 3, and 1.9 eV for 4. The strongest transitions take place in all dyes at 490–535 nm. Dye 1 has another strong transition at 395 nm which is at the border of the UV light. The absorptions and excitations support the previous spectroscopic studies:17 the first excitation takes place inside the donor of the p-type D–A dye, i.e. inside TPA in 1 and inside PMI in 2–4, and electron transfers to the acceptor moiety of the dye, i.e. to the LUMO level of the acceptor in all dyes studied. Only 1 has one strong transition solely inside the acceptor, which is from HOMO−1 to LUMO. In this case, the excited state can relax back to the ground state, and if the relaxation is fast, it prevents the electron from transferring to the electrolyte. The excitations are depicted using molecular orbital images in the ESI,† Fig. S2–S5.

The “DOSs” (orbital energies) of the periodic dye models 1–4, which were calculated with DFT using CRYSTAL09 without surface, are illustrated in Fig. 5. The HOMO–LUMO gaps of the models 1–4 are 2.5 eV, 1.8 eV, 1.7 eV and 1.8 eV, respectively. The DOSs demonstrate that the valence orbitals produce strong, sharp peaks, which is typical for free molecules containing localized orbitals. The strong sharp peaks also indicate that the molecular orbitals of the dye are not interacting with their periodic images.
 Fig. 5  Total “DOSs” (orbital energies) of periodic dye models 1–4. Because the models are molecules in periodic boundary conditions, a set of sharp peaks is observed. Higher peaks are due to several orbitals being close in energy. 
Semiconductor
Our optimized NiO bulk model has a lattice constant, a0, of 4.213 Å and an indirect band gap of 4.5 eV. The effective mass, m*, of the hole calculated from the band structure using eqn (1) is 1.2. The indirect band gap of the NiO surface model is 4.0 eV and the effective mass of the hole is 0.6. This means that the surface conductivity is higher than the bulk conductivity. Further results of the bulk and the surface including the band structure and the DOSs are presented and discussed in the ESI.†
Dye molecule adsorbed on the surface
The geometries of the combined dye–surface models are presented in Fig. 3. The geometries of the dyes 1 and 2 on the NiO(100) surface are relaxed. Dye 1 (Fig. 3) is able to chemisorb either via one 1a or two 1b different carboxyl groups. Dye 1a prefers a tilted and dye 1b an upright position on the surface. Dye 2 is in an upright position on the NiO(100) surface. The adsorption energies are given in Table 2. The shortest distance between two dye molecules is 2.5 Å, meaning that the neighboring molecules can interact. The interaction may affect the adsorption energies and explain the differences between systems 1a and 1b (Table 2). The geometries of the dyes 3 and 4 were more challenging to optimize due to their structures, i.e. the phenyl linker between the donor and the acceptor in 3, and the large fullerene acceptor in 4. However, we will infer some features for the expected behavior of the combined systems of 3 and 4 based on the results calculated for 2 on the NiO surface. This can be done, because the donor moiety is the same and the carboxyphenoxy anchor unit is the same in 2 and 3. Moreover, the carboxyphenyl anchor unit in 4 is more rigid than the carboxyphenoxy anchor group in 2. This is justifiable also because the distance between the donor moiety and the NiO surface is comparable in each of these systems. The tilting was also observed for the partially optimized structure of 3, which is well founded, because the angle is expected to be about the same due to the sp3 hybridization of the ether oxygen in the carboxyphenoxy anchor. In the combined system of 4, the phenyl group of the anchor unit, which is directly bound to the PMI donor, makes the structure straight due to the sp2 hybridized aromatic carbon atoms. It is possible for hydrogen bonds to occur in two possible ways in our models. In the first case the hydrogen from the carboxyl group is dissociated and adsorbed on the surface near the dye molecule. In this case the hydrogen bond between the surface hydrogen and the carboxyl oxygen may form C–O(–Ni)⋯H(–O), where atoms in parenthesis belong to the NiO surface. However, hydrogen bonding is possible only if hydrogen stays close to the adsorbed dye molecule. In our models, we chose to place hydrogen next to the molecule and observe a hydrogen bond of 2.3 Å. The second case applies only to molecule 1a. Dye molecule 1 has two anchoring groups and in model 1a one of them is pointing away from the surface because the dye molecule is tilted. In addition, there is non-traditional hydrogen bonding between the carboxyl oxygen and the hexyl group (CO⋯H–C) with a distance of 3.1 Å.

The DOSs (Fig. 6) and the band structures (Fig. 7) were calculated for the dyes 1 and 2 chemisorbed on the four (4) layer thick NiO(100) surface slab. The band gaps of these combined systems are due to the frontier orbitals of the dyes which are 2.5 eV for 1a, 2.4 eV for 1b and 1.7 eV for 2. These are relatively close to the calculated HOMO–LUMO gaps of the free and periodical models which are collected in Table 3. However, it can be seen that adsorption can lower the HOMO–LUMO gap by 0.1–0.2 eV. A closer examination of energy levels of 1b reveals that the HOMO moves 0.1 eV higher in energy and LUMO + 1, located also at the donor part of the dye, moves down by 0.5 eV in energy due to the binding mode. Moreover, the NiO band gap drops from 4.06 eV to 3.96 eV, if chemisorption takes place through a single anchoring group and to 3.90 eV if it takes place through two groups. Transitions that are expected for these systems are presented in Fig. 7. The calculated effective hole mass, m*, is 0.7 for both 1 and 2 on the NiO(100) surface. Because the calculated m* is 1.2 for the NiO bulk and 0.6 for the NiO(100) surface, the surface conductivity for the combined system of 2 is higher than the bulk conductivity of NiO.

In the DOS and band calculations, the band gaps of the combined systems of 3 and 4 did not open properly with the functional and the basis set applied, despite the usage of the gap widening tools, so we did not obtain an appropriate description of the electronic structures.
The band structure of the NiO(100) surface remains mostly the same whether it is covered with the dye or not, except for the shift in energy. Another difference is that the band maximum locates on the Γ point in the combined system and on the S point when there is no adsorbate on the NiO surface. Because the surface and the dye molecule interact only weakly, it is assumed that the electronic transitions are similar to those predicted by the TDDFT calculations for the isolated dye molecules.
In all band structures 1a, 1b and 2 the HOMO is located above the valence band of the semiconductor, because we are using a perfect NiO model instead of p-type NiO with Ni-vacancies and high packing of the dye molecule. Both affect the energy level order between the surface and the organic layer. An increase of NiO p-doping raises the valence band maximum (VBM) above the HOMO level of the dye that is needed for driving the holes to the NiO surface. A similar potential drop is needed for electrons to flow from the dye to the electrolyte to complete the charge separation in the dye–semiconductor junction. For this reason, we can compare the dye molecules relative to each other by looking at the energy difference between the NiO valence band and the dye HOMO level.
The calculated HOMO–LUMO gap of dye 1 on the NiO(100) surface is 2.5 eV for the 1a model and 2.4 eV for the 1b model. The large gap makes dye 1 ideal for collecting sunlight in a tandem device. The distance between the HOMO and the conduction band is 0.60 eV in 1a and 1.03 eV in 1b. The HOMO–LUMO gap of 1.7 eV calculated for dye 2 on the NiO(100) surface (Fig. 6 (DOS) and Fig. 7 (band)) is smaller than that of dye 1, making 2 less ideal for a p-type dye. The HOMO of the dye is located 0.34 eV above the valence band, which is less than in the case of 1. This means that it is located deeper in the valence band in the actual p-NiO and there is more driving force for charge transfer to the dye. Moreover, 2 is the smallest dye molecule that was investigated on the NiO surface in this paper, therefore all of the structural parts of the combined system (the donor, the acceptor, and the surface) are close together which may make the charge transfer from one part to another easier.
4. Conclusions
The minimum energy geometries, electronic structures and electronic excitations of four p-type perylenemonoimide-based D–A dyes were calculated using DFT and TDDFT. PMI acts as an acceptor in 1 and as a donor in 2–4. The DOSs and band structures were calculated for the free dyes, the NiO bulk, and the NiO(100) surface and for the dyes 1 and 2 on the NiO(100) surface.
Dyes adsorbed on the surface can be in either upright position (1b, 2, 4) or tilted (1a, 3), depending on the geometry of the anchor and binding mode. Adsorption slightly lowers the NiO band gap, from 4.06 eV to 3.90–3.96 eV, and the dye molecule band gaps by 0.1–0.2 eV. Additionally, the adsorption mode in dye 1b moves the LUMO + 1 level down by 0.5 eV. The calculated effective mass of the hole, 1.2 for bulk, 0.6 for surface and 0.7 for combined models, indicates that in all cases the surface conductivity is higher than that of the bulk.
The band structures of the combined models 1a, 1b and 2 revealed that the binding mode in 1 affects the HOMO position by 0.5 eV. However, model 2 has the lowest HOMO level compared to the pristine NiO, which means that the HOMO level is located deeper in the valence band in the actual p-NiO and is expected to have the highest driving force for charge transfer to p-NiO. Moreover, 2 is the smallest dye molecule that was investigated on the NiO surface in this paper, therefore all of the structural parts of the combined system (the donor, the acceptor, and the surface) are close together which may make the charge transfer from one part to another easier. Also, it should be noted that the relative ordering of the dye HOMO and the NiO VBM can be changed and tuned by NiO doping.
Our next goal is to create a more accurate p-NiO model containing Ni vacancies and to use novel functionals such as GLLB-SC for more accurate analysis of the electronic structures.

 	Fig. 5  Total “DOSs” (orbital energies) of periodic dye models 1–4. Because the models are molecules in periodic boundary conditions, a set of sharp peaks is observed. Higher peaks are due to several orbitals being close in energy.	 


Adsorption energy	−4.1a	−2.8	−1.3

 	Fig. 6  DOSs of the combined systems 1a, 1b and 2.	 

 	Fig. 7  Band structures of the combined models 1a, 1b, and 2. The straight lines (blue for occupied and red for unoccupied) are for the molecule and the curved lines are for the surface. Black arrows express the electronic excitations and relaxations in the dye molecule. The red arrow indicates the closest distance between the valence band of the NiO(100) surface and the HOMO of the dye molecule.
