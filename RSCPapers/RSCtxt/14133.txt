    , Accepted 1st February 2023First published on 20th February 2023AbstractSize-dependent perovskite nanocrystals (PNCs) have manifested tremendous improvement in nonlinear optical (NLO) studies owing to their remarkable optical and electrical properties. However, the industrialization of these materials has been circumscribed by their toxicity and instability. Attractive candidates explored to date in the quest for frontline NLO properties include organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites (OIHPs). Given the remarkable stability of the formamidinium cation (HC(NH2)2+ = FA+)) over the methylammonium cation (MA+) in hybrid perovskites, FAPbBr3 was chosen as a prototype to investigate its interactions with Sr2+ ions. Intriguingly, SrCl2-doped FAPbBr3 PNCs showed enhanced three-photon absorption (3PA) comparable/superior to some recently reported PNCs. This work paves the way for developing more stable, less toxic organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite (OIHP) PNCs for optoelectronic applications.
Introduction
OIHP materials are attractive candidates in almost all technological fields, such as photovoltaics,1–5 luminescent solar concentrators,6 light-emitting diodes (LEDs), laser7,8 and memristors.9–13 Given the phenomenal performances of OIHPs, the true potential of PNCs in targeted optoelectronics needs to be exploited and has yet to plateau. Generally, perovskite materials rest in the ABX3 crystal structure, where A and B are monovalent and divalent cations and X is a halide anion. The B cation coordinates with six halide anions forming an octahedron, and interconnection of these octahedra creates voids in which the A cations are located. In these materials, the upper edge of the valence band (VB) is dominated by the p orbital of X, with minor antibonding contributions from Pb 6s. In contrast, B metal p orbitals contribute to the conduction band (CB) lower edge. Whereas A+ ions indirectly contribute to the formation of the bandgap of these materials.14 In the literature, nine alternative B metal cations have been reported, Co, Cu, Fe, Mg, Ni, Sn, Sr, Mn and Zn, to check the tolerance impact on perovskite films in photovoltaic applications.15 Interestingly, <3% of this metal being replaced with Pb gives higher tolerance without any loss in performance.16 In 2015, Federico Bella used perovskites with polymer electrolytes for application in solar cells (SCs).17 Sansoni et al. synthesized CsPbBr3 NCs under ambient conditions via a top-down approach.18 OIHP PSCs were used in a highly integrated flexible photo-rechargeable system based on quasi-solid-state zinc-ion micro-batteries.19 Interestingly, OIHP-based SCs achieved a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.8%.20 Herein, higher performance has been achieved by tuning the optoelectronic properties of OIHPs. Notably, bandgap engineering was achieved using different halides,21 metals15 and organic cations14 as dopants.22–24 A cumulative study on OIHP devices as a renewable energy source to split water into H2 and O2 was done by Pirrone et al.25 A cheaper and large-scale processable technique for stable large-area perovskite SCs (PSCs) using carbon-based materials was demonstrated by Fagiolari et al.26 Considering the toxicity of lead, more recent advances in lead-free PSCs for sustainable and clean energy production have been reviewed in the literature and achieved Cs2AgBiBr6 carbon-based PSCs with a high open-circuit voltage.27,28
In the past few decades, scientists have been fascinated by the optical nonlinearity of numerous interesting optical materials for their momentous applicability.29,30 The diverse applicability of novel entities in the nonlinear domain establishes them as potential candidates in significant photonic applications, such as optical switching, optical limiting, optical communications, and biomedical imaging. In recent years significant reports and reviews of PNCs have shown their emergence as remarkable optical materials in NLO and electronic responses, interacting to provide an ultrafast laser pulse and huge 2-photon absorption/multi-photon absorption (2PA/MPA).31–35 Generally, over a broad range of excitation wavelengths, PCNs have shown ¾ PA.36 Some research groups have established their candidature as strong saturable absorbers.37 Rhodamine B (Rh B), an organic laser dye, was recently doped in layered hybrid halide perovskite (LHHP) bis(4-methoxybenzylammonium) tetra-chlorido cadmate (4MBA2CdCl4) using a simple and cost-effective slow solvent evaporation technique. The NLO properties of this perovskite have been studied using the Z-scan method with a 785 nm CW laser where an RSA with a low optical limiting threshold of 0.8 MW cm−2 was reported by Ranjhani et al.38 Zhang et al.39 also reported the NLA coefficient of Cs4CuxAg2−2xSb2Cl12 double PNCs using an 800 nm, 250 nJ, 500 Hz fs laser to be ∼10−8 cm W−1. The NLO properties of Cs2AgBiBr6 double PNCs, exhibiting a TPA cross-section of ∼1906 GM and TPA coefficient of ∼10−11 cm W−1, were investigated.40 Our group has carried out extensive broadband ultrafast laser-interaction-triggered spectroscopic studies employing novel systems, such as nano entities,41–43 PNCs,29,30 and organic–inorganic compounds,44–46 unveiling their exotic photonic responses in the NLO domain. In the present work, FAPbBr3 is chosen as a prototype to investigate its interactions with Sr2+ and Cl− ions and its advances for NLO studies. A summary of the NLO responses of recently reported perovskites has been included in (ESI†) Table S1 and Fig. 1.

Materials and methods
Formamidinium bromide (FABr) (99.9% trace metals basis) was purchased from Dyesol. Dimethylformamide (DMF) (anhydrous, 99.8%), toluene (anhydrous, ≥99.9%), acetonitrile (ACN), chloroform, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (anhydrous, ≥99.9%), oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Lead(II) bromide (PbBr2) (≥98%) and SrCl2 were purchased from TCI and used as received.
Synthesis of FAPbBr3 PNCs
FAPbBr3 NCs were doped using strontium chloride (SrCl2) at 2%, 4% and 6% concentrations to investigate SrCl2-doped FAPbBr3 NCs in NLO studies and labelled FB-2, FB-3 and FB-4, respectively Fig. 2(a)–(d). The steps involved in synthesizing the PNCs are illustrated in Fig. 2(e). The synthesis of FAPbBr3 PNCs was carried out in a glovebox using the room-temperature synthetic (RTS) method.47,48 In a typical procedure, FABr (0.1 mm) and PbBr2 (0.1 mm) were dissolved in 1 mL of DMF and stirred for 4 h. The solution was filtered through 0.45 μm pore polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE). Subsequently, 40 and 120 μL of OAm and OA were added to the filtered solution. Thereafter, 100 μL were taken from this solution and injected into anti-solvent chloroform to obtain the PNCs, followed by purification using 1.5 mL of ACN/toluene solution in a ratio of 1:1, centrifugation at 3500 rpm for 10 min and, finally, stored in toluene and labeled FB-1 (pristine solution). The preparation of doped FAPbBr3 PNCs (FB-2 to FB-4) followed the same procedure mentioned above.

Experimental details
The absorption spectra were obtained using a UV-vis spectrophotometer (UV-2600 of SHIMADZU). PL spectra were recorded with an FP-8500 spectrometer. UV and PL data were recorded using toluene. The structural studies were done using a Bruker D8 Advance powder diffractometer (powder X-ray diffraction (p-XRD)) with Cu Kα radiation at 5 to 85° for 15 min under ambient conditions. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) with JEM-F200 kV was used to record selected area electron diffraction (SAED) images. ImageJ and Gatan Digital Micrograph (GDM) software were used to analyze the TEM images.
To perform the NLO studies, a femtosecond (fs) laser (M/s Coherent, Libra, 50 fs, 1 kHz, 800 nm) was utilized. Complete details of the experiments were reported in our earlier work.16 A LabVIEW-based lock-in amplifier and a photo-diode were employed for signal collection. We utilized a linear translational stage to scan the sample within the Rayleigh range to obtain the NLA and intensity-dependent refraction data.
Results and discussion
Morphology and structural properties
The electronic properties of PNCs depend strongly on the morphology, particle size, crystallinity and crystal orientation.54 A few well-established techniques for efficient PNC synthesis include hot-injection (HI) methods and ligand-assisted reprecipitation (LARP) methods. Nevertheless, small fluctuations in the temperature may result in poor quality control. Hence, most efforts have been devoted to the RTS method.47,48 Herein, PNCs were synthesized using the RTS method to achieve higher quality. Furthermore, optical spectroscopic measurements (UV-Visible and PL) were carried out periodically (>10 times) to check reproducibility when employing the RTS method. A noticeable difference in the band gap that was observed as time increased for data collection (Fig. S4, ESI†) was within the tolerable limit in the case of doped samples compared to undoped samples. Spectroscopic characterization techniques, such as Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) and UV-Visible spectroscopy, were used to characterize the reported compounds. EDX and mapping of individual grains confirmed the homogeneous distribution of Sr2+ and Cl− ions on the film surface (Fig. S1(a)–(c), ESI†). Additional characterization techniques, p-XRD and TEM, facilitated the drawing of a more detailed picture of the chemical composition of doped FAPbBr3 (FA-2 to FA-4). Diffraction peaks were indexed to the Pm-3m cubic structure, in good agreement with previously reported values for pristine PNCs (FA-1) (Fig. 4(a) and (d)).49,50 The lower angular shift of the (001) Bragg plane for excess doping with SrCl2 was attributed to lattice expansion and negative surface tension from the incorporation of Cl− and Sr2+ ions (Fig. 4(d)).51 Importantly, no additional peaks were seen in the doped samples, which could be due to the crystal unit cell structure not being affected by the replacement of Br− with Cl−. The corresponding interplanar distance with complementary diffraction angles and micro-strain associated with the crystal in the lattice was calculated using Williamson–Hall (W–H) plots. However, an increase in lattice strain in the case of 6% doping (FB-4 sample) is attributed to an increasing concentration of Sr2+ and Cl− ions in the FB-4 sample compared to the others (Fig. S2(a)–(d), ESI†). Furthermore, to predict the tendency toward particle agglomeration in doped PNCs, we calculated particle sizes using TEM micrographs in colloidal and dry samples, as illustrated in Fig. 3. Interestingly, in the FB-3 sample, we did not observe much difference in particle size between the two forms, representing lower agglomeration in the samples. An interplanar distance of 0.28 nm was observed in the pristine (FB-1) sample, corresponding to the (022) Bragg plane of the cubic structure, very close to the values obtained from the P-XRD data using the Bragg diffraction equation, which agrees well with the reported FAPbBr3 PNCs (Fig. S3(a)–(d), ESI†).49,50,52–54

Optical properties
The optical properties of materials are of prime importance for any optoelectronic application.55 Optical characterizations were recorded using UV-vis spectra and PL emission for the 4 types of PNC in toluene, as a solvent. Absorption spectra and band gap values for pristine PCNs (Fig. 4(e)) are similar to those reported in the literature.47,48 Notable differences in absorption values for doped PNCs indicate changes in particle size with increasing doping concentration. Whereas a blue-shift in the PL of the FB-3 sample with 4% SrCl2 concentration (Fig. 4(f)), attributed to quantum confinement effects (lower average size distribution), was consistent with the sizes calculated from the powder-sample HR-TEM micrographs.55,56 Significant enhancement in photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) was observed from 40% to 72% upon increasing SrCl2 doping of pristine PNCs in colloidal form.47,48 We used two organic surfactants during the synthesis: OAm enhances the solubility of lead salts, while OA acts as a hydrophobic ligand. The presence of surface ligands was analyzed using FTIR, as shown in Fig. 4(b) and (c). In previous reports, it was noticed that purification may etch the surface of the QDs with the removal of the ligand.57 Intriguingly, no significant change was observed between the four samples in the FTIR spectrum, indicating that both surfactants (OA and OAm) were retained after purification. Hence, it can be fairly well established from the data obtained from the UV, PL, p-XRD and FTIR that toluene did not induce a measurable change in the state of the surface of the PNCs, and it represents the stability of the 4% doped (FB-3) sample compared to the pristine (FA-1).

Applications of SrCl2-doped FAPbBr3 PNCs towards NLO
Femtosecond (fs) Z-scan studies were performed using the Z-scan technique initiated by Sheik-Bahae and co-researchers.42 We aimed to reveal the electronic nonlinearity of these novel perovskite entities using fs excitation. A schematic NLO experimental setup has been presented in the ESI† file (Fig. S4). These novel doped NCs exhibited reverse saturable absorption (it could be one of 2/3/multi-PA) in the open-aperture experimental configuration. In the case of the closed-aperture mode, the same nonlinear systems displayed a positive intensity-dependent refractive index (n2) with a valley–peak nature. In-depth theoretical fitting and analysis led to thorough estimation of specific fundamental NLO parameters, such as multi-PA cross-sections (σ) and NLO susceptibility [χ(3)]. The mathematical relations corresponding to the transmittance of the output beam beyond its interaction with the sample can be expressed using eqn (1) and (2). The multi-PA-induced open-aperture transmittance beam can be expressed as (1)
The transmittance of the beam in closed-aperture mode can be depicted mathematically as (2)where z0 is the Rayleigh range, Δ is the NLO phase-shift, and z is the position of the sample. Eqn (1) and (2) were primarily used to fit the experimental data. The extracted NLO parameters were retrieved from the theoretical fits and the remaining fundamental NLO parameters were subsequently estimated. Our previous reports gave details of the Z-scan calculations using fs pulses.42,43
We engaged 50 fs, 1 kHz and 800 nm amplifier pulses to systematically experiment with a peak intensity of ∼230 GM cm−2. In interaction with the fs amplifier pulses, all four concentrations of SrCl2-doped FAPbBr3 were observed to depict a strong 3PA. The inherent NLA phenomena can be attributed to the reverse saturable absorption (RSA) nature that has been observed in the open-aperture transmittance curves. The open-aperture data is represented in Fig. 5(a)–(d) for FB-1, FB-2, FB-3 and FB-4, respectively. In particular, from our detailed NLO studies involving doped FAPbBr3 NCs, we retrieved NLO parameters such as 3PA cross-section σ3PA (cm6 s2), 3PA coefficient γ (cm3 W−2), nonlinear refractive index n2 (cm2 W−1) and third-order NLO susceptibility index [χ(3)], corresponding to each colloidal nanocrystal system. Among the four samples, FB-1, FB-2, FB-3 and FB-4, showing a prominent RSA nature, FB-2 NLA was inherently RSA, but with a comparatively higher 3PA coefficient. We believe that the percentage of SrCl2 dopant and the average size of the NCs can be attributed as determining factors for generating a greater number of defect states suitable for resonant multi-photon transitions and tuning the optical nonlinearity. The theoretically fitted data revealed the 3PA coefficients (γ) to be 1.3 × 10−22 cm3 W−2, 2.3 × 10−22 cm3 W−2, 1.4 × 10−22 cm3 W−2, and 1.6 × 10−22 cm3 W−2, for FB-1, FB-2, FB-3 and FB-4, respectively. The corresponding 3PA cross-sections were estimated to be 2.6 × 10−77 cm6 s2, 4.7 × 10−77 cm6 s2, 2.9 × 10−77 cm6 s2, and 3.3 × 10−77 cm6 s2. The correlation of the observed changes in NLO absorption coefficients with different amounts of SrCl2 doping can be established partly by understanding the variation in energy levels. The linear transmittances for FB-1, FB-2, FB-3 and FB-4 were 0.78, 0.80, 0.76 and 0.81, respectively. The experiments were performed with similar concentrations for all the samples. The nonlinear absorption also depends strongly on the structural deviation (in terms of size), which is also related to the linear optical absorption (revealing the change in electronic energy levels). Also the nonlinear absorption depends on the excitation strength of high-intensity laser pulses and the concentration of nanoparticles. In the UV-visible absorption signature of FB-1 [Fig. 4(e)], two possible inter-band transitions, i.e., 430 nm and 488 nm, were observed in the perovskite system, which support resonances for effective 3PA (2PA + excited state absorption). The disappearance of the ∼430 nm peak in all the FB-2, Fb-3 and FB-4 spectra in Fig. 4(e) significantly conveys a rearrangement of the energy levels and changes in the corresponding charge transitions due to SrCl2 doping. On the other hand, in the FB-2 absorption spectrum, there is a noticeable maximum redshift in the ∼488 nm peak towards ∼518 nm in comparison with FB-3 and FB-4. The enhanced 3PA can be attributed to the relatively larger sizes and distribution of the NCs (Fig. 3) achieved for FB-2 (25 nm; 10–70 nm) in comparison with FB-3 (14 nm; 8–22 nm) and FB-4 (16 nm; 10–26 nm). It is evident that the variation in SrCl2 doping has clearly led to an alteration in the size of the NCs as well as subsequently in their optical responses. The size alternation was observed to be significantly interrelated with the lattice expansion and negative surface tension by incorporation of Cl− and Sr2+ ions on the surfaces of the NCs. This variation in size distribution has decisively controlled the tunability of optical absorption, leading to an alteration in the inherent electronic states as well as the band gap. A combination of energy level restructuring (with doping) and size effects could have resulted in an enhanced 3PA for FB-2. In case of the closed-aperture mode, the phenomenon of an intensity-dependent valley–peak-type refractive index was observed. In a similar fashion, the complete closed-aperture data has been presented in Fig. 5(e)–(h) for FB-1, FB-2, FB-3 and FB-4, respectively. The n2 measured here is ultrafast and depends on the electron distribution, which again has been altered due to doping. This could be a reason for the strong n2 observed in the case of FB-4. The overall third-order nonlinearity depends on the sizes of the NCs owing to quantum confinement effects.55,56 A reasonable structure–property relationship can only be achieved with equal-sized pure and doped PNCs and with experiments performed under similar conditions, such as concentration and peak intensity. The PNC closed-aperture data conspicuously revealed a positive refractive index based on the Kerr-lens effect. The valley–peak curves confirmed the focusing nature of the NC systems. The inherent n2 values were retrieved from theoretical fitting of the closed-aperture transmittance data. The calculated n2 values were 6 × 10−16 cm2 W−1, 6.5 × 10−16 cm2 W−1, 6.6 × 10−16 cm2 W−1 and 7.4 × 10−16 cm2 W−1 for FB-1, FB-2, FB-3 and FB-4, respectively. Interestingly, FB-4 exhibited superior nonlinearity in its intensity-dependent focusing Kerr-lens response. Subsequently, the real part of the third-order optical susceptibility [χ(3)] was also methodically assessed for each corresponding n2. The order of magnitude of the real part of χ(3) was found to be ∼10−14 e.s.u. Having established the complete picture, it is evident that SrCl2 doping has decisively increased the NLO response of the NCs, making them superior candidates for all-optical switching and photonic applications. The nonlinear absorption coefficients are some of the strongest reported for such molecules in the recent literature.

Closed-aperture Z-scan data can be observed as purple-coloured spheres in (e) FB-1, (f) FB-2, (g) FB-3, (h) FB-4, along with the corresponding theoretical fits (red solid lines). 
A complete summary of the obtained NLO coefficients has been presented in Table 1. Aspects of the theoretical fitting and the mathematical relations utilized to calculate various NLO parameters have already been thoroughly reported in our previous work. The contribution of the solvent (toluene in this case) to overall optical nonlinearity was also measured under identical experimental parameters and was negligible (Fig. S5, ESI† file). Perovskites have been explored in photovoltaics, light-emitting diodes and lasers due to their NLO properties and high chemical stability. Mushtaq et al.58 reported the NLO properties of lead-free double perovskite Cs2AgIn0.9Bi0.1Cl6 nanocrystals using the femtosecond Z-scan method. The study demonstrates the presence of a strong 3PA, suitable for Kerr-nonlinearity-based nonlinear applications, such as optical shutters for picosecond lasers. Ban et al.59 experimented with NLO properties such as 2PA for individual CsPbBr3 superlattices. TPA has been observed to be enhanced by 16 times compared with randomly oriented nanocrystals. The polarization-dependent PL revealed a 4-fold symmetry similar to the single-crystal film. Intensity-dependent absorption revealed that the TPA coefficient could be more prominent than those of WS2 or ZnO. Due to these strong NLO signatures, CsPbBr3 is used for NLO devices like optical power limiting and switching.

Conclusions
We have successfully optimized and demonstrated more stable SrCl2-doped FAPbBr3 NCs for ultrafast NLO studies. Enhanced stability and a lowered tendency towards agglomeration were confirmed from the spectroscopy and TEM micrographs in the FB-3 sample, with enhanced 3PA. Interestingly, we observed an increase in PLQY with increasing dopant concentration from 40% to 72%. This work paves the way for achieving more stable, less toxic organic–inorganic hybrid PNCs. The PNCs studied herein could be potential candidates for photonic applications, and further scope for improvement in the NLO parameters is possible by tuning their sizes. Further, wavelength-dependent studies in the NIR region can provide more possibilities for other optoelectronic applications of these materials.
