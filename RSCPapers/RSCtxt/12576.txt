    , Accepted 13th January 2015First published on 14th January 2015AbstractNew π-conjugated alternating donor–acceptor polymers, BPD–DTT and PPD–DTT, based respectively on benzo[c]pyrrole-4,6-dione (BPD) and pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione (PPD) acceptor structures with the 2,5-dithienylthieno[3,2-b]thiophene (DTT) donor structure were synthesized via Stille cross-coupling polymerization to study their physical and optoelectronic properties. For comparison, an analogous polymer, TPD–DTT, derived from thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione (TPD) was also prepared by the same approach. These polymers displayed reasonably good solubility in common organic solvents (e.g., THF, toluene, etc.), and were thermally stable to about 350 °C in nitrogen or air. Both BPD–DTT and PPD–DTT showed blue shifts in their UV-vis absorptions and photoluminescence compared with those of TPD–DTT, suggesting that both possess lower degrees of π-delocalization than TPD–DTT, and thus shorter effective π-conjugation lengths and higher air stability as evidenced from their lower HOMO energy levels. Optical band gaps of 1.61 eV, 1.82 eV, and 1.73 eV and HOMO levels of −5.06 eV, −5.32 eV, and −5.20 eV were estimated for TPD–DTT, BPD–DTT and PPD–DTT respectively from spectral and electrochemical measurements. Electrical characterization showed that all three polymers behaved predominantly as p-type semiconductors in organic field-effect transistor and bulk-heterojunction organic solar cell devices.
1. Introduction
The interest in π-conjugated alternating donor–acceptor (D–A) polymers (herein referred to as D–A polymers) has been burgeoning over the past decade, owing to their potential for use in emerging organic electronics such as organic thin-film transistors and photovoltaic technologies.1–9 The much desired physical characteristics such as good solution processability and mechanical flexibility as well as functionally capable electrical properties of many D–A polymers have rendered them particularly attractive for low-cost, large-area, and novel flexible and stretchable electronic applications.1,3,6 One of the appeals of D–A polymers as active materials for organic electronics is the relative ease in tuning their chemical, physical, and optoelectrical properties through composition design and side-chain engineering.1 For instance, the oxidative doping stability of D–A polymers can be modulated through their electron donor and acceptor strengths since ground-state charge transfer in a D–A polymer system is known to provide air stability.5 In addition, side-chain engineering through appropriate branching can also lead to dramatic improvement in solubility characteristics.10 All these would be useful for low-cost solution-processed electronic applications.
Of a wide variety of D–A polymers investigated, only a few classes have shown promise as active materials for organic electronic applications. These are the D–A polymers derived from diketopyrrolo-pyrrole (DPP),5,10,11 and isoindigo12–14 structures, and to some extent, thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione (TPD)15–18 acceptors, which owe their electron accepting ability to the presence of an amide or an imide electron-deficient group. Even though the imide functionality such as that in TPD has stronger electron accepting ability than the amide functionality in DPP or isoindigo, the coupling of two amide functionalities in the latter two makes them stronger electron acceptors than TPD. The weaker electron deficiency of single-imide-based acceptors has thus rendered them interesting electron acceptors for the construction of p-type semiconductors with stronger electron donors in contrast to many n-type semiconductors based on di-imide acceptors.19 As with amide functionality, imide also permits easy side-chain engineering for solubility characteristics and molecular self-assembly. Not surprisingly, imide has recently been aggressively investigated as an electron-deficient functionality in electron acceptors for D–A polymer design.15–18 However, most of these studies have focussed on TPD as the electron acceptor moiety, with some of these D–A polymers reported to exhibit reasonable optoelectronic properties, e.g., a field-effect mobility of ∼0.6 cm2 V−1 s−1 in organic field-effect transistors (OFETs)13 and power conversion efficiency of over 7% in organic bulk heterojunction organic solar cells (BHJ OSCs).16–18 In view of these recent developments, we report herein our investigation on new imide-functionalized D–A polymers based on benzo[c]pyrrole-4,6-dione (BPD) or phthalic imide and pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione (PPD) (shown in Chart 1).
 Chart 1  Structures of TPD, BPD and PPD. 
These D–A polymers, BPD–DTT and PPD–DTT, are based on the corresponding acceptors, BPD and PPD, with dithienylthieno[3,2-b]thiophene (DTT) as the donor. DTT was selected as the donor moiety for its rigid coplanar structure in enabling a relatively planar polymer backbone, which would be conductive to close intermolecular π–π interactions of charge carrier transport. A structurally similar TPD-based polymer, TPD–DTT, was also prepared as a reference for studying the physical, electrochemical and optoelectrical properties. OFET and BHJ OSC devices were fabricated with these polymers as solution-processed p-type semiconductors.
2. Experimental
2.1 Materials and measurements

N-(2-Hexyldecyl)thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione (1),20 2-(2-octyldodecyl)pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,3-dione22 and 2,5-bis(trimethylstannyl)-thieno[3,2-b]thiophene14 were prepared according to published procedures. N-(2-Hexyldecyl)benzo[c]-pyrrole-4,6-dione or N-(2-hexyldecyl)phthalimide (4)21 was prepared quite similarly to the published procedure, only changing the incorporation of amine to 2-hexyldecyl-amine. All chemicals for the synthesis were purchased from Aldrich and were used without further purification unless stated otherwise. All the reactions were conducted under a nitrogen atmosphere.
NMR spectra were recorded on a 300 MHz, Bruker Avance DPX 300 apparatus in CDCl3 solution. Elemental analysis (EA) was determined on a Vario el elemental analysis instrument. Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) was performed on a Shimadzu HPLC system using THF as an eluent against polystyrene standards. UV-visible absorption spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu UV 3101 spectrophotometer. Fluorescence spectra were recorded on a PerkinElmer LS-45 Luminescence Spectrometer. Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) measurements were performed under a nitrogen atmosphere at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 using a TA 2920 analyzer. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) measurements were performed on a Perkin Elmer Diamond TG/DTA analyzer under both nitrogen and air atmospheres at a heating rate of 20 °C min−1. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were conducted on a three-electrode electrochemistry workstation (Model CHI006B) in 0.1 M anhydrous acetonitrile solution of Bu4NBF4 at 25 °C under a nitrogen atmosphere. A glassy carbon disk coated with a thin layer of polymer film was used as the working electrode, a silver wire as the pseudo-reference electrode and a platinum wire as the counter electrode. The redox potentials were calibrated against the ferrocene/ferrocenium couple as an internal standard.

2.3 Experimental device fabrication
Top-contact, bottom-gate OFET devices were fabricated on a silicon wafer under ambient conditions without taking any precautions to exclude air, moisture and ambient light. A heavily n-doped silicon wafer with 300 nm-thick thermal silicon dioxide (SiO2) was used as the substrate/gate electrode, with the top SiO2 layer serving as the gate dielectric. The SiO2 surface of the wafer substrate was first cleaned by sonication in acetone, and then immersed in piranha solution (the volume ratio of H2SO4 to H2O2 is 2:1) for 5 minutes at room temperature. The cleaned Si wafer was then immersed in a 0.1 M solution of octadecyltrimethoxysilane (OTS-18 precursor) in toluene at 60 °C for 20 min, followed by rinsing with toluene and then blow dried with nitrogen. The polymer semiconductor solution in chlorobenzene (4 mg ml−1) was filtered through a syringe fitted with a 10-micron filter. It was then spin coated on top of the OTS-18-modified SiO2 surface, dried at 80 °C and then annealed in a vacuum oven at 120 °C for 2 h. A series of gold source/drain electrode pairs were deposited on the semiconductor layer by vacuum thermal evaporation through a shadow mask to create a set of FETs with various channel length (L) and width (W) dimensions, thus creating a series of FET devices with different dimensions. The devices were characterized under ambient conditions, and the saturated FET mobility was extracted from the following equation:ID = μCi(VG − VT)2(W/2L)where ID is the drain current, μ is the field-effect mobility, Ci is the capacitance per unit area of the gate dielectric layer (SiO2, 300 nm, Ci = 11.25 nF cm−2), and VG and VT are respectively the gate voltage and the threshold voltage. VT was derived from the relationship between the square root of ID at the saturated regime and VG by extrapolating the measured data to ID = 0. W and L are respectively channel width and length.
For BHJ OSC studies, the device fabrication using a general device structure of ITO/PEDOT-PSS/polymers:PC71BM(1:1 by weight)/Al was carried out in an inert atmosphere in a glove box. A layer of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) was first spin coated on a pre-cleaned indium-tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass substrate. Subsequently, a solution of a polymer semiconductor and the PC71BM blend (20 mg ml−1) in dichlorobenzene was spin-coated on the PEDOT:PSS layer and vacuum dried. This was followed by vacuum evaporation of an aluminium layer on top of the polymer semiconductor/PC71BM layer to form the cathode. The devices were dried, thermally annealed in a vacuum oven at 90 °C for 10 min, and then encapsulated for evaluation under ambient conditions. The final size of the devices was measured to be 3 mm × 3 mm. The photocurrents were obtained under 100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5G illumination. Repeated measurements were made on several devices to ensure reproducibility of the data.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Polymer synthesis
The syntheses of bis(5-bromo-2-thienyl)-functionalized acceptor monomers, 3, 6, and 11 for the polymers, TPD–DTT, BPD–DTT, and PPD–DTT respectively are summarized in Scheme 1. The monomers, 3 and 6, were prepared from the corresponding dibromo precursors, 1 and 4, via coupling reaction with tributyl(4-dodecylthiophen-2-yl)stannane, followed by bromination with NBS in THF to give the dibromo-monomers, 3 and 6, respectively. The bis(5-bromo-2-thienyl)-functionalized pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,3-dione monomer, 11, was prepared from the corresponding pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,3-dione, 7, via first alkylation with NaH, followed by bromination with NBS to give the dibromo compound 9. The latter was subjected to a coupling reaction with tributyl(4-dodecylthiophen-2-yl)stannane in dry THF with catalyst Pd(PPh3)2Cl2, refluxing for 24 h to afford dithienyl-substituted intermediate 9, which upon bromination with NBS afforded monomer 11. The co-monomer for the polymerization, 2,5-bis(trimethylstannyl)thieno[3,2-b]thiophene, was prepared according to the published procedure.14

Polymerization was carried out via Stille cross-coupling polymerization in chlorobenzene (Scheme 2) with a catalyst system of Pd2(dba)3/P(o-tolyl)3 at 130 °C for 72 h. After polymerization, the polymer product was isolated by first pouring the reaction mixture into methanol to precipitate the crude polymer. The crude polymer product was purified by Soxhlet extraction sequentially with methanol and hexane to remove the low molecular weight materials and impurities, followed by extraction of electrically pure polymer product with chloroform. The chloroform extract was concentrated by evaporation under reduced pressure, followed by dropwise addition to methanol with vigorous stirring to precipitate the polymer product. The polymers were characterized spectroscopically, and the molecular weight properties were measured by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) and tabulated in Table 1. All three polymers exhibited good solubility in common organic solvents such as toluene, chloroform and THF.

3.2 Thermal properties
The thermal behaviors of TPD–DTT, BPD–DTT, and PPD–DTT were studied by TGA and DSC measurements under nitrogen and air atmospheres and the TGA curves are shown in Fig. 1. In the TGA thermogram, a one-step degradation under a nitrogen atmosphere, likely resulting from the cleavage of side chains, was observed for all three polymers. The degradation occurred at a high temperature of about 400 °C for TPD–DTT and BPD–DTT, and at about 350 °C for PPD–DTT. All three polymers displayed a weight loss of about 5% at these decomposition temperatures in both nitrogen and air atmospheres, suggesting that all three are thermally very stable. No obvious glass transition temperatures were detected for all three polymers from the DSC measurements. These properties are summarized in Table 1.

3.3 Optical properties
The UV-visible absorption and photoluminescence spectra of TPD–DTT, BPD–DTT, and PPD–DTT in solution are depicted in Fig. 2, and the corresponding spectral data are summarized in Table 2. In dilute chloroform solutions, BPD–DTT and PPD–DTT exhibited absorption maxima at respectively 436 and 457 nm which are blue-shifted by 55 and 34 nm respectively from that of TPD–DTT. These are significant blue shifts, which can be attributed to lower degrees of π-delocalization in both BPD–DTT and PPD–DTT, thus shorter effective π-conjugated lengths than TPD–DTT. Thus, BPD–DTT and PPD–DTT are, in theory, more resistant to oxidative doping in air than TPD–DTT. The particularly large spectral blue shift of BPD–DTT can be understood from the repulsive interaction between the hydrogen atoms ortho to the substitution sites of the neighboring benzo and thienyl moieties of the polymer. This repulsive interaction has essentially twisted the polymer backbone structure, significantly cutting down the backbone π-delocalization leading to a much shorter effective π-conjugation length. In the case of PPD–DTT, its PPD moiety is a weaker acceptor than TPD, thus the extent of charge transfer in PPD–DTT would be expected to be much less than in TPD–DTT. This would translate to a lower degree of π-delocalization as well, thus a shorter effective π-conjugation length and the observed spectral blue shift from that of TPD–DTT. It is thus not surprising that among the three imide-based D–A polymers, TPD–DTT displayed the lowest band-gap absorption, extending into the near-infrared region. Accordingly, TPD–DTT would be expected to show the best BHJ OSC performance among the three polymers.

Photoluminescence spectra of the polymers were recorded in CHCl3 solution upon excitation of maximum absorption using a source of pulsed Xenon lamp. The emission maxima of BPD–DTT and PPD–DTT were at 555 and 560 nm respectively, corresponding to Stokes shifts of 119 and 103 nm, while TPD–DTT displayed an emission maximum at 595 nm and a Stokes shift of 104 nm. Accordingly, the photoluminescence of both BPD–DTT and PPD–DTT also exhibited similar blue shifts from that of TPD–DTT, in agreement with their shorter effective π-conjugation lengths.
In thin films, BPD–DTT and PPD–DTT displayed absorption maxima at 483 and 492 nm respectively (Fig. 3), which are approximately red-shifted by 47 and 35 nm from their respective solution spectral absorptions. These are to be expected on the basis of higher molecular ordering and thus enhanced π-conjugation in the condensed state. Likewise, TPD–DTT also exhibited significant red-shift in its thin-film spectral absorptions with an absorption maximum at 511 nm.

3.4 Electrochemical properties
The electrochemical properties of TPD–DTT, BPD–DTT, and PPD–DTT were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) (Fig. 4). The HOMO levels were estimated from the onsets of corresponding oxidative peaks. The LUMO levels were calculated from the differences between the HOMO energy levels and the optical band gaps. In Fig. 4, oxidation onsets of 0.92 V and 0.76 V were observed for BPD–DTT and PPD–DTT, respectively, corresponding to HOMO levels of −5.32 eV and −5.20 eV. Similarly, the HOMO level of −5.06 eV was estimated for TPD–DTT. The lower HOMO levels of BPD–DTT and PPD–DTT as compared to that of TPD–DTT are in agreement with their lower degrees of π-conjugation as discussed before. Thus, both are expected to be more stable against oxidative doping in air. The calculated LUMO levels of TPD–DTT, BPD–DTT and PPD–DTT were respectively −3.45, −3.50 and −3.47 eV.

3.5 Field effect transistor properties
The OFET characteristics of the polymers were studied using bottom-gate, top-contact thin-film transistor devices. The devices were built on a self-assembled monolayer OTS-modified silicon wafer substrate using the spin-coated D–A polymer as the channel semiconductor. The fabrication and characterization of FET devices were performed under ambient conditions. The evaluation showed that both TPD–DTT and PPD–DTT behaved as p-type semiconductors in FET devices, and the results are summarized in Table 3. Illustrative transfer characteristics and out curves of PPD–DTT as the channel semiconductor are shown in Fig. 5. The FET mobility values of 1.2 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 3.2 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 were obtained respectively for PPD–DTT and TPD–DTT devices after thermally annealing at 120 °C. The current on/off ratio for these devices was around 104. However, the FET characteristics of BPD–DTT devices were very weak under the same conditions. The observed low mobility of these polymers is likely due to their relatively low molecular weights as well as their poor crystallinity which was evident in their DSC measurements, thus contributing to the lack of TFT activity.

3.6 Photovoltaic properties
The BHJ OSC devices were fabricated in an inert atmosphere using a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC71BM (1:1, w/w)/Al. The current density–voltage curves are shown in Fig. 6 and the photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 4. It is very clear that the OSC devices based on these three polymers exhibit different open-circuit voltages, which are consistent with their HOMO levels. The device based on BPD–DTT show the highest Voc of 0.96 V, attributable to its lowest HOMO level among three polymers. Fig. 7 depicts the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the photovoltaic devices. The EQE spectra of the polymers reflected the absorption properties of each polymer, and TPD–DTT exhibited EQE values exceeding 18% over the range of 350–600 nm. In contrast, the EQEs of BPD–DTT and PPD–DTT dropped to 12% and 9% over the range. This result indicated that charge carrier generation as a result of photon absorption by BPD–DTT and PPD–DTT was not as efficient as by TPD–DTT. Consequently, the device based on TPD–DTT showed the best power conversion efficiency which is 0.84%, compared to 0.65% and 0.52% respectively for BPD–DTT and PPD–DTT devices. This is attributed to its broader and lower band gap absorptions which enable more efficient solar energy harvesting.

4. Conclusions
Three imide-based D–A polymers (TPD–DTT, BPD–DTT, and PPD–DTT), with their electron acceptor moieties derived from thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione (TPD), benzo[c]pyrrole-4,6-dione (BPD) and pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione (PPD) respectively and the electron donor moiety derived from 2,5-dithienylthieno[3,2-b]thiophene (DTT) were synthesized and investigated. All three polymers showed excellent thermal stability with a decomposition temperature significantly above 300 °C. Spectroscopic and photoluminescence studies show that the degree of π-conjugation in these polymers follows the order: TPD–DTT > PPD–DTT > BPD–DTT while the oxidative doping stability in air in the reverse order: BPD–DTT > PPD–DTT > TPD–DTT, in accordance with their HOMO levels. When evaluated as channel semiconductors in OFET devices, they all exhibited p-type semiconductor behaviors with very low hole mobility due largely to their low molecular weights, while in BHJ OSC devices as donor polymers, TPD–DTT showed the best photovoltaic performance of the three. Our present studies have thus shed light on the feasibility of using TPD, BPD and PPD as electron acceptor building blocks for the construction of D–A polymers for organic electronic applications.
