    , Accepted 5th February 2021First published on 5th February 2021AbstractThe shift towards renewable energy is one of the main challenges of this generation. Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), based on donor–acceptor architectures, can help in this transition as they present excellent photovoltaic efficiencies yet cheap and simple manufacturing. For molecular heterojunction DSSCs, donor–acceptor pairs are linked in a covalent manner, which facilitates their tailoring and rational design. Nevertheless, reliable computational characterization of charge transfer rate constants (kCT) is needed to speed this development process up. In this context, the performance of time-dependent density functional theory for the calculation of kCT values in donor–acceptor fullerene-based dyads has not been benchmarked yet. Herein, we present a detailed analysis on the performance of seven well-known density functional approximations (DFAs) for this type of system, focusing on several parameters such as the reorganization energies (λ), electronic couplings (VDA), and Gibbs energies (ΔG0CT), as well as the final rate constants. The amount of exact exchange at short range (SR) and long range (LR) electron–electron distances (and the transition from the SR to LR) turned out to be key for the success of the prediction. The tuning of these parameters improves significantly the performance of current DFAs.
Introduction
Renewable energy boosting is the 7th target of the United Nation member states’ 2030 Sustainable Agenda Development1 whose premise is to accelerate the transition to a competitive low-carbon economy. The production of non-contaminating renewable energy is undoubtedly one of the biggest challenges facing humanity nowadays. The Earth receives just a tiny fraction of the Sun's colossal power output. But even that tiny fraction represents 120000 trillion Watts and, consequently, we would need to harvest less than 0.02% to fulfill the energy consumed on the planet.2 Energy from the Sun can be collected with solar cells, which are devices that convert absorbed incident sunlight into electricity. Most current solar cells are silicon-based inorganic cells. These cells have a high cost, heavy weight, and their production requires high energy consumption and leads to environmental pollution.3 Thanks to their excellent photovoltaic efficiency and simple and low cost production process, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSC) are a promising member of the so-called 3rd generation of photovoltaic devices. Fullerenes and their derivatives have emerged as promising materials for the design of efficient DSSCs.4–8 Two different types of DSSCs are usually distinguished: bulk heterojunctions9 (BHJs) where the donor and acceptor (D/A) moieties are not covalently connected, and molecular heterojunctions10 (mHJs) with covalently linked donor–acceptor (D–A) dyads. The main advantage of mHJs is that charge transfer (CT) processes can be rationally designed since a better structural control and charge mobility tuning can be achieved within this approach.
Tuning the electronic and structural parameters of solar cells for optimum performance is a difficult task because several trade-offs should be considered. The experimental approach to optimize DSSCs is heuristic, mainly based on trial and error. In this sense, computational modelling of molecular interactions and charge transport in macromolecular photovoltaic materials is the most rational approach for the design of high-performance DSSCs. Computational modelling of the power conversion efficiency of DSSCs requires the knowledge of the charge transfer rate constants (kCT).11 In some cases, kCT values are known experimentally, but in most cases, the most efficient way for designing or tuning DSSCs is to estimate the kCT from calculations, and select the most promising D–A dyads to be used as building blocks for mHJ DSSCs, which should also contain anchoring groups to interact with TiO2 electron acceptors.12–15
There are a number of studies that have benchmarked different density functional approximations (DFAs) for the calculation of excited states based on time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT).16–23 It is widely accepted that standard functionals underestimate the excitation energies of CT states and only range-separated DFAs provide good estimates of these states.24–29 To our knowledge, despite its relevance, no benchmarks of DFAs for the calculation of kCT in D–A (fullerene) dyads are available yet. The present work aims to fill this void. In particular, we compare six well-known range-separated DFAs (CAM-B3LYP, ωB97xD, LC-ωhPBE, LC-TPSS, LC-BLYP, and M11) and one meta-hybrid-generalized gradient approximation (MHGGA) functional, MN15. For these seven DFAs, we calculate kCT of four D–A dyads for which experimental charge transfer rate constants are available.
Computational methods
The ground state geometry for each structure was optimized at the B3LYP-D3(BJ)/6-311G(d,p) level of theory,30–32 including dispersion interactions through the D3 empirical model of Grimme, with the Becke–Johnson damping.33,34 Previous studies have demonstrated that CT in DSSCs are mostly purely electronic processes and, for this reason, it is usually not necessary to account for the structural changes of the D–A dyads induced by the charge-transfer processes,35–37 except for the calculation of the reorganization energy. Nevertheless, in order to confirm whether this assumption holds for the systems studied herein, we have computed the root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of the atomic positions of D* with respect to D+ and A* with respect to A−, i.e. the two molecular fragments involved in the CT reaction. The highest RMSD obtained was <0.1 Å, confirming that one can address the CT reactions of this manuscript as purely electronic processes (see the ESI† for further details). In addition, D–A dyads considered in this work are relatively rigid, and, therefore, we do not expect large conformational effects.
The donor and acceptor geometries needed to estimate the internal reorganization energy (vide infra) and the geometrical changes upon CT were obtained at the same level of theory as the ground state equilibrium geometries.
Hundred lowest-lying singlet excited states for each D–A pair were computed using the TDDFT formalism with the polarized double-ζ Def2SVP basis set38 and the seven DFAs. The ground and excited state calculations were performed with the Gaussian 16 package.39
Analysis of excited states
A quantitative analysis of exciton delocalization and charge separation is carried out in terms of the transition density.40,41 It is convenient to perform the analysis using the Löwdin orthogonalized basis. The matrix λC, which contains the orthogonalized molecular orbital (MO) coefficients in the Löwdin orthogonalized basis, is obtained from the matrix C, formed by the MO coefficients in the original basis; λC = S1/2C, where S is the atomic orbital overlap matrix. The transition density matrix T for an excited state Φ* constructed as a superposition of singly excited configurations (where an occupied MO ψj in the ground state is replaced by a virtual MO ψa) is given by: (1)where Aj→a is the expansion coefficient and α and β are atomic orbitals. A key quantity Ω(D,A) is determined by: (2)The weights of local excitation on D and A are Ω(D,D) and Ω(A,A). The weight of electron transfer configurations D → A and A → D is represented by Ω(D,A) and Ω(A,D), respectively. The index CS = Ω(D,A) − Ω(A,D) describes charge separation between D and A; CT = Ω(D,A) + Ω(A,D) is the total weight of CT configurations in the excited state Φ*. Note that in the situation when charge transfer (D → A) is equal to the back transfer (A → D) there is no charge separation between the fragments, and CSD→A is equal to zero. With this methodology, CT states (CTS) and local excited states (LES) can be easily distinguished and identified. In LES, the excitation is mostly localized on a single fragment (CS < 0.1 e), whereas in CTS electron density is transferred between D and A (CS > 0.9 e). Mixed states have significant contributions of LE and CT.
Solvent effects
The equilibrium solvation energy EeqS of a molecule (in the ground or excited state) in the medium with the dielectric constant ε was estimated using a COSMO-like polarizable continuum model42,43 in the monopole approximation: (3)where f(ε) is the dielectric scaling factor, f(ε) = 1 − 1/ε, Q is the vector of n atomic charges in the molecular system, and D is the n × n symmetric matrix determined by the shape of the boundary surface between the solute and solvent. D = B+A−1B, where the m × m matrix A describes the electrostatic interaction between m surface charges and the m × nB matrix describes the interaction of the surface charges with n atomic charges of the solute.42,43 The GEPOL93 scheme44 was used to construct the molecular boundary surface.
The charge on atom X in the excited state Φ*, , was calculated as: (4a) (4b)where q0X is the charge on atom X in the ground state and ΔX is its change due to excitation.
The non-equilibrium solvation energy for the molecule in the excited state Φ* can be estimated as:45 (5)In eqn (5), n2 (the refraction index squared) is the optical dielectric constant of the medium and the vector Δ describes the change of atomic charges, see eqn (4b); and Q0 is the vector of atomic charges in the ground state. By definition, the external (solvent) reorganization energy is the difference of the non-equilibrium (eqn (5)) and equilibrium (eqn (3)) solvation energies of the excited state.
CT rates
Within the nonadiabatic electron transfer theory, the CT process DA → D+A− can be described with the Marcus equation:46,47 (6)where λ is the total reorganization energy, ΔG0CT is the Gibbs energy difference between the final and the initial states under standard conditions, VDA2 is the square of the electronic coupling of the donor and acceptor, kB is the Boltzmann constant, ℏ is the reduced Planck constant, and T is the temperature, which was set to 298 K for all systems. The Marcus equation is widely used to estimate the rate of nonadiabatic electron transfer.
Reorganization energy, λ
The total reorganization energy (Fig. 1, right) is usually decomposed into the internal and external contributions (λint and λext). λint is the average of the energy required to distort the nuclear configuration from the D+−A− ((D–A)*) equilibrium geometry to the equilibrium geometry of the (D–A)* (D+−A−) state without transferring an electron. And λext is the corresponding energy required to change the slow (reorientational) part of the solvent polarization between both equilibrium geometries. In this study, λint was computed considering the isolated donor and acceptor, which contribute separately to the internal reorganization energy: λint = λD + λA(7)where λD and λA are the reorganization energy of the donor and acceptor. In turn, λD was estimated as (8a) (8b) (8c)En(D) and Eion(D) are the energy of the neutral and ionic states of the donor computed at their equilibrium geometry, and  is the energy of the neutral state computed at the equilibrium geometry of the ionic state D+.  is the energy of D+, estimated at the equilibrium geometry of D. Similarly, we calculated λA using equilibrium geometries of A and A−.

There are two contributions to the solvent polarization corresponding to fast electronic relaxation and a much slower dipole reorientation. During vertical electronic excitation, the solvent does not have enough time to fully relax, and the situation is described by nonequilibrium solvation (Enoneq) where only electron polarization is allowed. The equilibrium solvation (Eeq) assumes both electronic and dipole relaxation. Accordingly, the external reorganization energy, λext, is the difference between these two quantities (Enoneq − Eeq). This scheme to estimate λext is widely accepted and is an extension of the two-sphere Marcus model.48
Electronic coupling and changes in Gibbs energy
There are a number of studies focusing on the development of theoretical frameworks for the evaluation of electronic coupling.49–51 In this manuscript we made use of the Fragment Charge Difference method (FCD) to derive the coupling of LES and CTS calculated with TDDFT.52 Within the two-state model, the D–A coupling reads (9)where Δqi and Δqj are the difference in the donor and acceptor charges in the adiabatic states Φi and Φj, respectively, and Δqij is the charge difference computed from the Φi → Φj transition density matrix.
The Franck–Condon excitation in solution and photoinduced charge transfer reactions in most C60-based D–A dyads is summarized in Fig. 1, left. First, the photo-sensible system gets excited by light to one high-in-energy LES, which then relaxes to the lowest LES, LES1. In this step, the electron–hole pair (exciton) is generated in the fullerene cage (usually C60). The following step is the electron–hole pair separation, in which one electron is transferred from the donor to the acceptor. The ΔG0 of this step corresponds to the CT process (ΔG0CT). Finally, the charge recombination occurs, thus leading to the recovery of the ground state. Note that CTS are usually stabilized by polar environments much stronger than LESs and thus the solvent effects should be accounted for.
Results and discussion
We have evaluated the performance of seven DFAs; namely MN15,53 M11,54 CAM-B3LYP,55 ωB97xD,56 LC-ωhPBE57,58 LC-TPSS,59 and LC-BLYP30,31 (the last six are range-separated functionals, and the last three are based on the range separation scheme from Hirao and coworkers60) for the calculation of charge transfer rates, kCT, in C60-based donor–acceptor pairs. This set of functionals was selected because they tend to be the best for CT studies among the huge variety of DFAs.24–27
The four molecular dyads studied (Fig. 2) are C60-azulene (C60-Az);61 C59N-phthalocyanine (C59N-Pc);62trans-2 C60-ZnTPP;63 and C60-triphenylamine (C60-TPA).64 All of them were previously reported in the literature as functional materials with experimentally measured rate constants. In addition, these systems are relatively rigid and, consequently, here conformational fluctuations play a less important role than in other more flexible dyads. For these systems, we analysed the key parameters that affect kCT, i.e. λ, VDA, and ΔG0CT.

Reorganization energy, λ
The internal and external contributions to the reorganization energies, λint and λext, computed for all DFAs are listed in Table 1 (and Fig. S4–S6 in the ESI†). For each system, the mean and the standard deviation (SD) of both parameters for the DFAs studied were calculated. As seen, all DFAs give a similar value of λint (SD does not exceed 0.05 eV). Therefore, the small variations in λint cannot lead to a substantial change in the predicted kCT. Higher variations are found for λext, with the largest SD of 0.15 eV.

The relatively small values of λint computed for the dyads are associated with a significant delocalization of excess charges generated on the donor and acceptor after CT. One may expect that in fullerene containing systems the changes in λint are mainly due to the donor moiety. Also, the charge delocalization and the size of the acceptor modulate the value of λext (Table 1). This is an interesting feature of fullerene-based DA molecules.
As we shall see in further sections, there is much more uncertainty in other quantities that will be the main sources of error in predicting kCT. In general, the reorganization energy, λ, is a parameter that does not drastically vary by passing from one DFA to another and therefore is not the origin of the error.
Electronic coupling, VDA
The electronic coupling, VDA, is known to be sensitive to the mutual orientation of the donor and acceptor sites. In general, many thermally accessible conformations of the D–A complex should be considered. However, we calculated the coupling only for the equilibrium structure of the complexes because all four studied systems are relatively rigid, either due to the presence of only a few dihedral angles or due to strong stabilizing π–π stacking interactions. Thus, we expect that the computed values of VDA (Table 2, and Fig. S7 and S8 in the ESI†) are quite reliable. Nevertheless, we are aware that one should account for thermal structural fluctuations if more insight into the values of the VDA is desired.

Note that CAM-B3LYP, and specially MN15, gives slightly smaller values than the rest of the DFAs analysed. Interestingly, all DFAs distinguish two clearly different behaviours regarding VDA2: C60-ZnTPP and C60-TPA on one hand and C60-Az and C59N-Pc on the other. The latter present VDA2 values ca. 3 orders of magnitude greater than the former.
ΔG0CT calculations
We have seen already that λ does not have a critical impact on the evaluation of the kCT for the four systems studied since the variation among them is minor. ΔG0CT is present in the exponential part of the Marcus equation as well, thus it should be analysed carefully since the errors present in ΔG0CT have an exponential translation into the rate constant. CT reactions should present negative or slightly positive ΔG0CT values to take place. Computationally, small positive values can also be accepted at the DFT level, since other electronic states are usually very close in energy to the ones of interest and therefore, for an accurate (and far more expensive) calculation of these energies one should use multireference methods. Fortunately, for C60-Az, C59N-Pc, and C60-TPA experimental ΔG0CT values are available and the DFT accuracy is benchmarked against them in Table 3 (and Fig. S9 and S10 in the ESI†). For a light-harvesting material, the Gibbs energy for the charge separation (ΔG0CS) is usually found in the normal Marcus region, therefore ΔG0CT values are expected to be negative in order for the charge transfer to occur at a given rate (and that is what happens herein). This is a great difference with respect to the charge recombination processes, which present their ΔG0 (ΔG0CR) in the Marcus inverted region. In this manner, the lifetime of the CTS is usually longer. If this is the case, their theoretical evaluation becomes even more challenging. For ΔG0CT values, not as that in previous variables, it can be seen that the choice of DFA is crucial for its correct evaluation. LC-ωhPBE, LC-TPSS, and LC-BLYP always give positive ΔG0CT values when they should be negative. Although kCT can still give reasonable results due to some error cancellation, one expects to get the suitable thermodynamics of the cycle depicted in Fig. 1. The highest error, 1.57 eV, is given by LC-BLYP for C60-Az. On the other hand, a qualitative good description for ΔG0CT values is given by MN15, M11, ωB97xD, and CAM-B3LYP. For the C60-ZnTTP system, we expect to have negative ΔG0CT values since MN15, CAM-B3LYP, ωB97xD, and M11 predict so. It is important to notice that in the exponent of eqn (6) there is not only ΔG0CT, but also (λ + ΔG0CT)2. It could happen, then, that the correct kCT is reached due to some error compensation effect between incorrect ΔG0CT and λ. This, in general, does not occur in our case (see Tables S1–S6, ESI† for details). We want to finish this section stressing on the fact that ΔG0CT is probably the best tool to discriminate at first sight whether a specific DFA will perform appropriately or not for CT rate constant evaluations, and based on the results of Table 3, MN15, CAM-B3LYP, ωB97xD, and M11 are found to be the most promising DFAs. The last three functionals clearly do not predict properly even the qualitative sign of ΔG.

Charge transfer rate
After the parameters of the Marcus equation have been examined, we are now in the position to look into the estimated charge transfer rates. We compare the relative errors of the calculated values of log(kCT) with the experimental data (Table 4, Fig. 3 and Fig. S1–S3 in the ESI†). The absolute values are listed in the ESI† (Tables S1–S6). The best overall performance is given by the CAM-B3LYP functional, followed by MN15 and ωB97xD with a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 6.3%, 10.9%, and 14.25%, respectively. Functionals LC-ωhPBE, LC-TPSS, and LC-BLYP show worse results due to inaccurate estimates of ΔG0CT. In general, worst functionals always underestimate the rate constants, whereas best functionals tend to slightly overestimate some of them, except for the case of C60-TPA, for which all functionals underestimate kCT. The analysis of the DFA errors split by systems clearly shows that CAM-B3LYP, MN15, ωB97xD, and M11 are not only the best functionals in MAPE but they are also the best functionals for each system, as can be seen in Fig. 3. It is worth mentioning that all DFAs give very good predictions for C59N-Pc, whilst the biggest error is always found for C60-Az.

 Fig. 3  Mean percentage error of the log(kCT) for the four donor–acceptor dyads and the seven DFAs studied in this work. 
The DFAs show similar and most accurate values of ΔG0CT and kCT for C59N-Pc (Table S3 in the ESI†). It is worth mentioning that C60-Az computed at the MN15 level of theory presented two pseudo-degenerate CTS which present almost identical kCT of 1.13 × 1013 s−1 and 1.70 × 1013 s−1. We finally reported the CTS leading to the former kCT since the rest of the parameters, and specially the electronic coupling, resembled more the ones computed with other DFAs, thus indicating that we are targeting the same CTS for all functionals.
The construction of the DFA has a clear impact on the final results. For a general long-range corrected (LC) hybrid scheme, the 1/r12 operator for the exchange part of the functional is split into the short-range (SR) and long-range (LR) parts, (10)where r12 is the interelectronic distance. On the right-hand side of eqn (10), the first term governs the SR part and the second term governs the LR part of the functional. Note that using this equation, α controls the amount of exact exchange (HFX) added at all interelectronic distances, while β governs the extra amount of HFX added at LR; and the separation between SR and LR is controlled by the ω attenuation parameter. In this context, the exchange–correlation energy, EXC, can be expressed as (11)where DFAX corresponds to the (semi)local exchange energy. Eqn (11) can be used for the construction of CAM-B3LYP (α = 0.19, β = 0.46, ω = 0.33 Bohr−1), MN15 (α = 0.44, β = 0.00), LC-ωhPBE (α = 0.00, β = 1.00, ω = 0.40 Bohr−1), LC-TPSS (α = 0.00, β = 1.00, ω = 0.47 Bohr−1) and LC-BLYP (α = 0.00, β = 1.00, ω = 0.47 Bohr−1). However, the construction of ωB97xD follows a slightly different parametrization since it treats differently the HFX than the DFAX part, in particular ωB97xD can be defined as (12)where cx = 0.222036. Similar to theoretical predictions of the UV-visible absorption spectra of fullerenic and non-fullerenic DA molecules,65 the amount of exact exchange added to the DFAs through the range-separated scheme appears to be a key parameter to control the performance of DFA for charge-transfer reactions. First, the attenuation parameter should be relatively small (i.e. <0.4 Bohr−1) and therefore the transition towards the long range region should occur at rather big electron–electron distances to get suitable kCT values. One could think that having less HFX at the short range region will be somehow compensated by a larger value of the attenuation parameter (to switch to the long-range region at shorter distances, i.e. LC-ωhPBE, LC-TPSS or LC-BLYP). However, this compensation is not observed and some amount of HFX must be added at the short-range to get accurate rates, as in cases with CAM-B3LYP (19%), MN15 (44%), and ωB97xD (22%). On the other hand, the optimal amount of HFX at long range needs to be <100%, as the best DFAs have 0.65 (CAM-B3LYP) and 0.44 (MN15) of total HFX at long-range. The same requirement has been reported to be beneficial, in terms of the accuracy of the results, for other long-range properties such as electronic excitation energies.66,67 The usage of (α + β) < 1 can be rationalized as a requirement to reproduce the effective dielectric constant of the material (α + β = εeff) that tailors the decay of the XC potential as (εeffr)−1.66,67 For M11 functional α + β is equal to 1.0. However, it has two other desirable features: (1) the attenuation parameter is relatively low (clearly lower than in LC-BLYP, LC-TPSS or even LC-ωhPBE), and (2) the HFx term at short electron–electron distances is not zero.
Tuning: a look into the future?
Charge transfer rate constants demand properly taking into account the long-range interactions to be accurately computed, a well-balanced self-interaction error and a proper decay of the exchange–correlation potential. In this and some other fields, range-separated functionals can be tuned to meet such requirements.68 Herein we have tested, as a proof of concept, two tuning schemes for LC-BLYP, which is the worst method overall, trying to improve their results for C60-TPA. Our goal was to perform a preliminary study to explore if the tuned-DFAs have the potential to be good candidates to be used for the evaluation of log(kCT).
First, we forced LC-BLYP to fulfill Janak's theorem (OT1) by screening the ω parameter,69 as proposed by Kronik and coworkers.70,71 The working ω for OT1 was 0.236. Similarly, we also tested a novel tuning strategy recently developed by some of us (OT2).72 In OT2 the empirically tuned attenuation parameter is given by a function of a molecular descriptor defined from the linear polarizability and the number of electrons in the molecule. The resulting ω was determined to be 0.303.
Then, charge-transfer rates for OT1 and OT2 were computed (Table 5). It has been reported that the variation of the DFA may change the character of the charge transfer states determined by eqn (2).73 We also observe this effect. Since the CT character of the D+–A− state increases going from LC-BLYP (CS = 0.717, CT = 0.723) to OT1 (CS = 0.930, CT = 0.931) and OT2 (CS = 0.982, CT = 0.982), the D+–A− state becomes almost a pure CT state. The state character for the DFAs can be found in the ESI.†

It is clearly seen that the tuning of range-separated DFAs can have a deep positive impact on the accuracy of the obtained results. For C60-TPA the errors are reduced more than three-fold going from pristine LC-BLYP to OT1, and those are divided by more than 1.5 again when moving to OT2. Therefore, a five-fold improvement of the logarithm of the rate constant is achieved using OT2. Interestingly, both OT1 and OT2 tuning schemes give ω between the values for CAM-B3LYP and ωB97xD, which leads to a sharp decrease of the corresponding relative error of computed kCT.
Furthermore, from pristine LC-BLYP to OT2 we are going towards a qualitatively more reliable description of the system since ΔG0CT is becoming closer to the experimental value of −0.31 eV. Moreover, OT2 is the only DFA from the LC-BLYP family that presents the suitable sign for the ΔG0CT of the CT, which is conceptually very important. Interestingly, the λext for OT2 is clearly different from the ones of pristine LC-BLYP and OT1, being closer to the ones for CAM-B3LYP (0.94 eV) and MN15 (0.97 eV) or ωB97xD (0.82 eV), which could be an indicator of quality. Nevertheless, more effort should be put into these tuned functionals to be better than other alternatives such as CAM-B3LYP or MN15 for the evaluation of charge transfer processes. In that line, the ideal candidate to be tuned in further work using the OT2 procedure is CAM-B3LYP. There are other alternatives to tuned DFAs, such as the new revM11 functional, which is tailored to tackle ground- and excited-state properties.74
Conclusions
We have analysed several factors that can determine the accuracy of the computed charge transfer rate for four fullerene-based systems, namely, C60-Az, C59N-Pc, C60-ZnTPP, and C60-TPA, at the DFT level of theory with six well-known range-separated GGA DFAs (CAM-B3LYP, ωB97xD, MN11, LC-ωhPBE, LC-TPSS, and LC-BLYP) and one meta-hybrid-GGA functional, MN15. We have found that the estimation of the reorganization energy and the electronic coupling given by all benchmarked DFAs have a small impact on the final accuracy of charge transfer rate. In contrast, ΔG0CT has been proven to be a critical parameter for the CT rate computation. Only the MN15, ωB97xD, and especially CAM-B3LYP functionals are able to describe ΔG0CT accurately enough, correctly reproducing their negative sign. These three DFAs give also best results for the kCT estimated using the Marcus theory. Overall, we recommend CAM-B3LYP as the best choice for modelling fullerene-based materials. Tuning the amount of full range and long range HFX seems to be a promising strategy that needs to be explored in order to develop more accurate functionals for predicting the photophysical properties.
