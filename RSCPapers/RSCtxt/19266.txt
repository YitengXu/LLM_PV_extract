    , Accepted 9th March 2023First published on 17th March 2023AbstractInterface engineering has become one of the important subjects in developing efficient and stable perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, an interfacial molecular linker, chloroformamidine hydrochloride (CFA), is introduced to modify the properties of electron transport layers (ETLs) and modulate the interaction between the ETL and perovskite (PVK) layer via coordination/electrostatic coupling. It is found that the CFA molecular linker can passivate the oxygen vacancies/interfacial defects of SnO2 and construct an improved energetic alignment between the ETL and PVK layer. Consequently, a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 23.47% with an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.17 V for the target device is achieved. Moreover, unencapsulated PSCs based on CFA-modified SnO2 (CFA@SnO2) ETLs show enhanced thermal and moisture stability compared with PSCs without CFA modification. This work provides a feasible strategy to tune the interface between the ETL and PVK for efficient and stable PSCs.
Introduction
Interfacial engineering between the perovskite (PVK) layer and indium tin oxide (ITO) electrode plays a key role in the electron-extraction process for n-i-p type PSCs.1–10 Although SnO2 has been widely applied as an electron transport layer (ETL) in perovskite solar cells (PSCs) due to its wide bandgap (3.6–4.5 eV), high transmittance, high charge mobility and suitable energy band alignment with PVK,11 the easily formed oxygen vacancy (OV) defects, surface hydroxyl groups or Sn dangling bonds by low-temperature processed SnO2 and the weak physical contact at the SnO2/PVK layer interface usually lead to interfacial charge trapping/recombination, which is harmful to the performance and stability of PSCs.4,12–14
Several classes of materials, such as inorganic salts (e.g., KCl, RbF, NH4F, and NH4Cl) and organic molecules (e.g., biguanide hydrochloride and imidazoleacetic acid hydrochloride) have been reported to modulate the properties of the SnO2 ETL for improving device efficiency and stability.15–20 On one hand, doping metal cations and/or halide ions is an effective strategy to control the Fermi level and electrical conductivity of SnO2. For example, Park et al. reported that Li-doped SnO2 (Li:SnO2) as the ETL shows the enhancement of conductivity in SnO2, facilitating electron transfer.21 On the other hand, cations and/or anions from ionic salts can not only facilitate PVK nucleation and growth, but also simultaneously passivate the defects of the PVK layer by chemical interaction. For instance, a positively charged functional group such as a pyridinium cation or –NH3+ cation can interact with the halide anion in PVK and passivate Pb-I antisite defects or cation vacancies, facilitating the crystal growth of PVK. Meanwhile, a functional group with a lone pair of electrons or negatively charged groups such as –NH2, –COO−, and –SO3− can anchor to the surface of SnO2 through coordination or electrostatic interactions.19,20,22–24
Despite the great deal of modified materials developed so far, research focuses mostly on improving the SnO2 itself, or modulating the surface conditions of SnO2, which can influence the quality of PVK films via coordination, electrostatic interactions or hydrogen bonding interactions. Inspired by this, it will be interesting and significant to find a compound that possesses two functional groups at both ends of the molecule, which can not only interact with SnO2 but also simultaneously interact with the PVK layer to increase the device performance.
In pursuit of such a molecular linker for bridging the SnO2 and PVK, our attention is diverted toward an organic small molecule, chloroformamidine hydrochloride (CFA, Fig. 1a), containing a functional cation (NHC(Cl)–NH3+) and anion (Cl−). The CNH and Cl− in CFA is able to passivate uncoordinated Sn4+ defects and OV within SnO2via coordination and electrostatic coupling interactions, respectively. Furthermore, the NHC(Cl)–NH3+ and Cl− can also passivate cation and halide anion vacancy defects of PVK through electrostatic interactions, respectively. Consequently, our experimental results indicate that the CFA molecular linker can not only decrease OV and increase the electron mobility of SnO2, but also optimize the SnO2/PVK interface with decreased trap-state density and matched energetic alignment, facilitating charge carrier transport. Benefiting from these synergistic effects, the PSC based on CFA@SnO2 can achieve a PCE of up to 23.47%, higher than 22.40% of PSCs based on SnO2. Furthermore, unencapsulated PSCs based on CFA@SnO2 exhibit high stability, which maintains 84% of its initial PCE after aging for 360 h at 40% RH and 20 °C, as well as 96% of the original PCE at 50 °C and about 20% RH for 312 h.

Results and discussion
Characterization of SnO2@CFA
The diluted SnO2 colloidal solution with acidic CFA remains clear and transparent when CFA concentrations are 0.4 mg mL−1 and 1.0 mg mL−1 (Fig. S1, ESI†). For convenience, CFA@SnO2 represents the optimal concentration of 0.4 mg mL−1 CFA to the diluted SnO2 colloidal solution. CFA@SnO2 films display similar transmittance in the visible region to SnO2 (Fig. S2, ESI†). X-ray diffraction peaks for SnO2 and CFA@SnO2 films are identical to the tetragonal SnO2 structure (Fig. S3, ESI†).11
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were employed to study the interaction between CFA and SnO2. There is an obvious peak assigned to the Cl 2p orbital in the CFA@SnO2 film, indicating CFA exists on CFA@SnO2 (Fig. S4 and S5, ESI†). Fig. 1b shows that the binding energies of Sn 3d5/2 (486.49 eV) and Sn 3d3/2 (494.91 eV) peaks for SnO2 are shifted to 486.38 eV and 494.80 eV after CFA modification, respectively, suggesting that –NH2 and Cl− of CFA could passivate uncoordinated Sn4+ through coordination.19,25 From the O1s spectra in Fig. 1c, the peak at a low binding energy (530.47 eV) and at a high binding energy (531.61 eV) are assigned to lattice oxygen (OL) and OV in SnO2, respectively. The amount of OV in SnO2 and CFA@SnO2 films is 35.5% and 27.5%, respectively (Table S1, ESI†). The decreased OV might be attributed to the passivation via electrostatic coupling interaction between the Cl− of CFA with Sn4+.25,26
The energy level of the CFA@SnO2 ETL might be altered because of the chemical interaction between the CFA and SnO2. Thus, ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) measurements were conducted (Fig. S6a, ESI†). The calculated work function (WF) of CFA@SnO2 is 4.81 eV, which is lower than that of 4.96 eV for SnO2 (Fig. S6b, ESI†). The valence band maximum (EVBM) of the SnO2 and CFA@SnO2 are measured to be 2.65 eV and 3.77 eV below EF, respectively (Fig. S6c, ESI†). The deeper EVBM ensures a higher energy barrier for the hole injection at the ETL/PVK interface, thereby suppressing interfacial charge recombination losses.19 The conduction band minimum (ECBM) of the SnO2 and CFA@SnO2 are −3.37 eV and −4.33 eV, respectively (Table S2, ESI†). Fig. 1d shows the energy band diagram. The suitable energy band alignment between CFA@SnO2 ETL and the PVK layer is beneficial for charge carrier transfer.27
We also measured the electron mobility of the SnO2 and CFA@SnO2 by means of the space charge-limited current (SCLC) model (detailed description in the ESI†). The mobility of the CFA@SnO2 is about 3.75 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, higher than that of the SnO2 (1.55 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1), as shown in Fig. 1e. The higher conductivity of the CFA@SnO2 in comparison with the SnO2 further verifies the improved charge transport (Fig. 1f). The significant enhancement in the conductivity and electron mobility of the CFA@SnO2 ETL can be ascribed to effective passivation of OV defects.19
Crystallization of perovskite on the CFA@SnO2 ETL
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) characterization was performed to investigate the effect of CFA on the surface morphology of PVK films deposited using a two-step spin-coating method (Fig. S7, ESI†). Fig. 2a and b show that smooth and dense PVK films are formed on both SnO2 and CFA@SnO2 substrates. From the cross section in Fig. 2c and d, the PVK film deposited on CFA@SnO2 substrates clearly exhibits vertical and unbroken crystal grains along the normal direction of the interface compared to the control sample. The contact angle of the CFA@SnO2 film is decreased to 10.00° compared to 12.96° of the SnO2 film (Fig. S8, ESI†). The smaller contact angle of the CFA@SnO2 film would reduce the Gibbs free energy for heterogenous nucleation, thereby promoting the growth of PVK.27,28

Cross-sectional SEM images of PVK films based on (c) SnO2 and (d) CFA@SnO2 substrates with a structure of ITO/SnO2/PVK/Spiro-OMeTAD. The thicknesses of the SnO2 and PVK layer are about 24 nm and 660 nm, respectively. 
X-ray diffraction (XRD) was carried out to examine the crystal structures of PbI2 and PVK films based on SnO2 and CFA@SnO2. As shown in Fig. 3a, the PbI2 or PVK films deposited on SnO2 and CFA@SnO2 exhibit identical crystal structures (Fig. S9, ESI†). The characteristic diffraction peak at 12.67° is assigned to the PbI2 phase, and that at 14° is assigned to the (001) crystal face of the FAPbI3 phase. The PbI2 phase in PVK comes from the decomposed PVK during annealing or unreacted PbI2.29 Moreover, the intensity ratios of the PbI2 diffraction peak to the (001) diffraction peak of FAPbI3 deposited on SnO2 and CFA@SnO2 substrates are 2.71 and 3.54 as illustrated in Fig. 3b, respectively. The increased PbI2 content in the PVK layer slightly reduces the absorption of the PVK film (Fig. S10, ESI†).29 It was suggested that PbI2 could form type I band alignment with PVK, and passivate the surface or grain boundaries of PVK.30–33

XPS characterization was conducted to study the chemical interaction between PbI2 and CFA. Fig. 3c and d show that both the Pb 4f and I 3d peak of PbI2 films based on CFA@SnO2 shift toward lower binding energies, compared with that based on SnO2. The shifted binding energy should be due to the coordination of C–Cl and CN with Pb2+, electrostatic coupling of NHC(Cl)-NH3+ and Cl− with PbI64− octahedron.19,25 Attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) was applied to further confirm the chemical interaction between PbI2 and CFA (Fig. S11, ESI†). In general, CFA can chemically link to both SnO2 and PbI2 layers via coordination and electrostatic coupling, which potentially contributes to improving crystal growth and interface contact.
Characteristics of charge carrier dynamics in PSCs
Steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) measurements were conducted to investigate the radiative recombination and carrier lifetime. Fig. 4a demonstrates that the PVK film based on the CFA@SnO2 substrate has a decreased PL intensity when the excitation light is incident from the PVK side, revealing more efficient charge extraction and transport at the interface of CFA@SnO2/PVK than SnO2/PVK. PL intensity decay curves can be fitted using a bi-exponential decay equation of I(t) = I0 + A1exp(−t/τ1) + A2exp(−t/τ2), where τ1 and τ2 represent fast and slow decay time constants, respectively. The average time constant (τave) is calculated using the equation of τave = (A1τ12+ A2τ22)/(A1τ1 + A2τ2). As depicted in Fig. 4b, the charge carrier lifetime is 570.57 ns and 442.50 ns for the PVK film based on SnO2 and CFA@SnO2, respectively (Table S3, ESI†). The PL quenching and shortened carrier extraction lifetime indicate the enhanced electron extraction and transport at the CFA@SnO2/PVK interface.

To further quantitatively evaluate the function of CFA on the defect density of the PVK film, electron-only devices (ITO/ETL/PVK/PCBM/Ag) were prepared. As displayed in Fig. 4c and d, there are three regions listed below: the Ohmic region at low bias, the trap-filled limited region at intermediate bias region, and the trap-free SCLC region at high bias.20 The trap-filled limited voltage (VTFL) is the transition voltage between the Ohmic and trap-filled region. The trap density value (ntrap) can be calculated using the following equation:  where ε0 is the vacuum permittivity, εr is the relative dielectric permittivity of PVK (εr = 46.9), VTFL is the trap-filled limit voltage, e is the elementary charge, and L is the thickness of the PVK film. Upon treating SnO2 with CFA, the defect density in the device is reduced from 9.12 × 1015 cm−3 to 3.26 × 1015 cm−3, manifesting that CFA can passivate the bulk and interface defects of the PVK film. Moreover, the electron injection becomes easier from the PVK layer to the CFA@SnO2 ETL than to the SnO2 ETL (Fig. S12, ESI†), which can be attributed to the improved level alignment at the CFA@SnO2/PVK interface.27,34
Then, we examined the light-intensity-dependent J–V characteristics during the device operation to understand the charge carrier recombination. By fitting with the power law of JSC ∝ Iα, where the exponential factor α represents the extent of biomolecular recombination, the extracted α of the CFA-modified PSC is closer to 1.0 than that of the control PSC, indicating the decreased interfacial charge recombination (Fig. S13, ESI†).35,36 In addition, the slope of light intensity dependence of VOC is 1.64 kT q−1 for the SnO2-based PSC and 1.48 kT q−1 for the CFA@SnO2-based PSC, respectively, where k is the Boltzmann's constant, T is the temperature, and q is the elementary charge (Fig. 4e). The smaller slope for CFA@SnO2-based PSC reveals that trap-assisted nonradiative recombination is effectively suppressed due to the decrease in defect density, which might contribute to the higher VOC.20
To further understand the charge collection characteristics at the interface between the ETL and PVK layer, we measured the photocurrent density (Jph) as a function of the effective voltage (Veff), with Jph = JL − JD, where JL and JD are the current density under illumination and dark conditions, and Veff = Vbi − Vbias, where Vbi is the voltage when Jph = 0 mA cm−2, and Vbias is the applied voltage, respectively. As shown in Fig. 4f, the Jph value of the CFA@SnO2-based device is higher at the same Veff, indicating a higher charge collection efficiency.35
Operation and stability of CFA@SnO2-based PSCs

Fig. 5a illustrates a FAPbI3-based planar PSC with a configuration of ITO/SnO2 or CFA@SnO2/PVK/Spiro-OMeTAD/Au. Devices with different amounts of CFA introduced in SnO2 colloidal solution were tested, and the highest PCE was gained at a concentration of 0.4 mg mL−1 (Fig. S14 & Table S4, ESI†). For the hysteresis test, Fig. 5b and c show J–V curves measured under reverse (1.2–0 V) and forward scan (0–1.2 V) of PSCs with the active areas of 0.04 cm2 and 0.10 cm2, respectively. It is found that the reverse scan demonstrates a higher performance than the forward scan, and the gap between the reverse and forward scan of the CFA@SnO2-based PSC decreases compared with the SnO2-based PSC. Photovoltaic parameters of PSCs based on SnO2 and CFA@SnO2 ETLs under reverse scan and forward scan are summarized in Table 1. The reduction of hysteresis for CFA@SnO2-based PSCs could be ascribed to the decreased trap density of the PVK film and the high electron mobility of CFA@SnO2 to suppress the charge accumulation at the interface.27

Finally, the CFA@SnO2-based PSC achieves a champion PCE of 23.47% (VOC = 1.17 V, JSC = 25.79 mA cm−2 and FF = 77.77%) and 22.54% (VOC = 1.16 V, JSC = 25.01 mA cm−2 and FF = 77.71%) with the active area of 0.04 cm2 and 0.10 cm2, respectively (Fig. S15 & Table S5, ESI†). Statistical distributions of photovoltaic parameters obtained from 20 individual devices exhibit high reproducibility (Fig. S16 and S17, ESI†). The enhancements of VOC can be attributed to the energy band alignment and decreased interface defects. The increase of JSC and FF are related to the improved electron transport/extraction at the CFA@SnO2 ETL/PVK interface. The PSC based on SnO2 affords a stable PCE output of 22.79% at the maximum power point of 0.94 V, while the PSC based on CFA@SnO2 exhibits a stabilized PCE output of 23.70% at the maximum power point of 0.98 V (Fig. 5d & Fig. S18, ESI†).
The long-term stability is crucial to the application of PSCs.37 Therefore, we investigated the moisture stability and thermal stability of unencapsulated devices. Fig. 5e demonstrates that the control device degrades by 30%, whereas the CFA@SnO2-based device degrades by 16% after 360 hours stored at 40% RH, respectively. Fig. 5f shows that 84% and 96% of their initial PCE are maintained for the SnO2 and CFA@SnO2-based device after thermal aging at 50 °C in the air (about 20% RH) for 312 hours. The CFA@SnO2-based device presents improved thermal and moisture endurance compared to the control device.
Conclusions
In summary, CFA, as a molecular linker, is demonstrated to optimize the electronic properties of ETLs and the charge carrier extraction/transport at the SnO2/PVK interface. First, the reduced work function of SnO2 after modification by CFA promotes better energy band alignment between the PVK and ETL. Second, the decrease of oxygen vacancy defects facilitates the electron extraction/transport at the CFA@SnO2/PVK interface. Third, the chemical interaction between PbI2 and CFA contributes to defect passivation for PVK and improves the PVK film quality. As a result, the CFA@SnO2-based PSC achieves a PCE of 23.47% with an enhanced VOC compared to the control device (22.40%). Moreover, the CFA@SnO2-based PSC shows better moisture stability and thermal stability than the control PSC. This work provides a strategy to simultaneously regulate the electronic properties of ETLs and the ETL/PVK interface for efficient and stable PSCs.
