    , Accepted 10th February 2023First published on 12th February 2023AbstractPerovskite/organic tandem solar cells (TSCs) have attracted increasing attention owing to their potential for high performance solution processable photovoltaics. However, Br/I mixed-halide perovskites as the active layer of wide band gap (WBG) front subcells suffer from inevitable photoinduced phase segregation. Here, quasi-2D perovskites free of phase-segregation are selected to act as the light-harvesting layer of the WBG front subcell due to their high operation stability under continuous illumination. A semi-empirical model was developed to estimate the practical limit of the photovoltaic parameters of the TSC devices with active layers of different band gaps and film thicknesses. By reasonable selection of an interface modification material as the hole transport layer, ultra-low open-circuit voltage (Voc) loss below 0.4 V was realized for the front subcell. The optimized TSC device exhibits a maximum PCE of 21.3% and high Voc of 2.06 V, together with excellent operation stability with T90 beyond 500 hours under the maximum power point condition in an air atmosphere.
Introduction
Benefiting from the intrinsic properties of perovskites, such as high absorption coefficient, low exciton binding energy, long exciton diffusion length and high charge carrier mobilities, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has reached up to 25.6% in a few years.1–12 Perovskite-based tandem solar cells (TSCs),13–32 such as perovskite/Si TSCs, perovskite/CIGS TSCs, perovskite/perovskite TSCs, and perovskite/organic TSCs, together with the integrated perovskite/bulk-heterojunction solar cells,69,70 have also attracted intense interest recently for their potential to overcome the Shockley–Queisser limit, and exhibit impressive advances. Presently, perovskite/Si TSCs exhibit a champion PCE of over 32%, though perovskite/Si tandem devices are incompatible with a low-temperature, low-cost fabrication process.16 As to the solution-processable all-perovskite TSCs, the high-cost protective layer for the front subcell is indispensable to achieve high-performance.14
Perovskite/organic TSCs could combine the advantages of bandgap tunability, light weight, flexibility, low-temperature processibility, large-area solution processability of the perovskite and organic materials.27–33 The wide bandgap (WBG) perovskite front subcell could also prevent the degradation of the organic rear subcell by filtering ultraviolet (UV) irradiation.28 Furthermore, the orthogonal solvents used for perovskite and organic active layers can minimize the damage to the perovskite film and potentially reduce the obstacles in low-cost solution manufacture. Recent rapid progress of organic solar cells based on narrow bandgap (NBG) non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) with light absorption beyond 1000 nm (ref. 30 and 34–38) promotes the development of the perovskite/organic TSCs, as shown in Table S1.† By means of selecting the light-harvesting materials for front and rear subcells with matched bandgap, passivating the defects of perovskite, and optimizing the structure of the interconnecting layer, the PCE of perovskite/organic TSCs has reached 24%.28 However, the Br/I mixed-halide perovskites now used in the front subcell of TSCs exhibit inevitably photo-induced phase segregation, which is harmful to the long-term stability of TSCs.21,29,32,39,40 Besides, the reported WBG subcells in TSC devices suffer from large energy loss exceeding 0.5 V and even higher (Table S1†).
Quasi-two-dimensional (2D)41–47 perovskites can also achieve tunable wide bandgap. The advantages of better moisture resistance and suppressed ion migration make quasi-2D perovskites promising alternatives for the WBG active layer in the front subcell of TSCs. With efforts on tuning the orientation of 2D perovskite layers, design of organic spacer cations, composition engineering, device engineering and so on, a remarkable efficiency of 22.26% has been achieved for quasi-2D PSCs.48 Previous reports show that the devices based on quasi-2D perovskites can provide open-circuit voltage (Voc) loss lower than 0.5 V, regardless of the band gap of the active layer (Table S2†), indicating that further reduced Voc loss could be expected in the quasi-2D perovskite based front subcells.
Here, a quasi-2D perovskite was applied as the light harvesting layer of the front subcell to construct a quasi-2D perovskite/organic TSC. The Voc loss of the quasi-2D perovskite subcell was reduced by selecting 2,3,5,6-tetrafluoro-7,7,8,8-tetracyanoquinodimethane (F4-TCNQ) doped poly[N,N′-bis(4-butylphenyl)-N,N′-bis(phenyl)-benzidine] (poly-TPD) as the interface layer to promote charge extraction from the quasi-2D perovskite to the hole transport layer (HTL). Finally, the 1.73 eV-bandgap quasi-2D perovskite front subcell presents a remarkable Voc of 1.35 V with a small Voc loss of 0.38 V. The optimized TSC device exhibits a PCE of 21.3% with a high Voc of 2.06 V, a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 13.3 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 78.3%. A semi-empirical model was applied to evaluate the route for further improving the performance of quasi-2D perovskite/organic TSCs. Moreover, the TSC shows outstanding operating stability which retained 90% of its initial PCE after 500 h maximum power point tracking under continuous one-sun illumination in an air atmosphere.
Results and discussion
Interface and bandgap engineering for the quasi-2D perovskite subcell with low Voc loss
For the quasi-2D PSCs with an inverted structure of ITO/NiOx/quasi-2D perovskite/PC61BM/BCP/Ag, the Voc loss could be reduced by proper surface modification of the HTL layer.49,50 NiOx has advantages of good water resistance and non-corrosiveness for device stability.71,72 Here, poly[bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine] (PTAA) and poly-TPD (doped with F4-TCNQ) (Fig. S1†) were selected to modify NiOx for better energy level alignment at the HTL/active layer interface. The quasi-2D perovskite, BA1.8PEA0.2MAn−1PbnI3n+1 (n = 4), was deposited on the HTLs with similar transmittance (Fig. S2†) by the one-step spin-coating method according to the previous work.51 The BA1.8PEA0.2MA2Pb4I13 films on NiOx with different modifications show similar morphology (Fig. S3†) and XRD pattern (Fig. S4†), indicating that the interfacial modification wouldn't affect the crystallization of quasi-2D perovskite films. The characteristic diffraction peak at 28.3° is stronger than that at 14.1°, indicating the preferred growth orientation of the crystals along the (202) plane.47,52,53 The energy level diagram of the device is shown in Fig. 1a. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels are determined by the ultraviolet photoelectron spectrometer (UPS) measurement (Fig. S5†). The optical bandgap of the quasi-2D perovskite film is calculated from the photoluminescence spectrum (Fig. 1b). Poly-TPD modified NiOx possesses a deeper HOMO level (−5.38 eV) than the PTAA modified one (−5.2 eV), which improves the energy level alignment between the HTL and the active layer, and thus facilitates the hole extraction as evidenced by the result of time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) measurement. As shown in Fig. 1c, fitting the TRPL curves by the biexponential equation, τ = A1exp(−t/τ1) + A2exp(−t/τ2), more rapid carrier transfer can be observed from the BA1.8PEA0.2MA2Pb4I13 film to poly-TPD modified NiOx (τ1 = 5.1 ns) than to the PTAA modified one (14.9 ns). Besides, compared to PTAA modified NiOx, poly-TPD modified NiOx film exhibits higher conductivity, calculated from the current–voltage (I–V) characteristics of the device with the structure of ITO/modified NiOx/Au54 (Fig. S6†), which could also benefit the charge extraction. The photovoltaic characters of the single-junction PSC devices based on poly-TPD modified NiOx exhibit elevated Voc, Jsc and FF (Fig. S7 and S8†), which can be attributed to the improved charge transfer evidenced by results of TRPL and conductivity measurements. The highest value of PCE is 16.90% with a high Voc of 1.29 V and low Voc loss of 0.40 V, suggesting that poly-TPD modified NiOx is the appropriate HTL for the front subcell based on quasi-2D perovskites.

The bandgap of BA1.8PEA0.2MAn−1PbnI3n+1 was adjusted by tuning the nominal n values (n = 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5) to achieve better current matching with the narrow band gap (NBG) organic rear subcell. The cross-sectional SEM images and XRD patterns in Fig. S9† show that quasi-2D perovskite films with different n deposited on poly-TPD modified NiOx present a compact structure and preferred growth along the (202) plane. The calculated bandgap is 1.73 eV for n = 3, 1.71 eV for n = 3.5, 1.69 eV for n = 4, 1.68 eV for n = 4.5 and 1.67 eV for n = 5 quasi-2D perovskite, respectively (Fig. 1a). According to the bandgaps and the HOMO levels obtained from the UPS spectra (Fig. S5†), we can find that BA1.8PEA0.2MAn−1PbnI3n+1 with different n values shows good energy level alignment with the charge transport layers (CTLs), PC61BM and poly-TPD modified NiOx (Fig. 1a), ensuring efficient charge extraction from the perovskite to CTLs.
The representative J–V curves of the PVSCs based on quasi-2D perovskites with different n values are shown in Fig. 1d and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table S3.† As shown in Fig. S10,† with higher n, Jsc increases obviously, because of the broadened light absorption (Fig. S11 and S12†) induced by the narrowed band gap. The PCE improves from 15.2% to above 17% with a similar FF. Owing to the ultra-low Voc loss of 0.38 V, the n = 3 quasi-2D perovskite device presents a Voc of 1.35 V, which is the highest Voc among the quasi-2D PSCs. When compared with the front subcells in previous studies (Fig. 1e and Table S1†), the selection of the quasi-2D perovskite yielded an ultra-low level of Voc loss around 0.4 V and a high value of Voc, which is favorable for elevating the voltage output of the perovskite/organic TSCs.
The stability of the quasi-2D perovskite was compared with the Br/I mixed-halide perovskite applied in front subcells of most perovskite/organic TSCs (Table S2†). As shown in Fig. S13a,† after 15 minutes UV (470 nm) illumination, an obvious split of the PL emission peak can be observed for FA0.6MA0.4PbI1.8Br1.2 due to photo induced phase segregation,30 while the PL emission is unchanged for the quasi-2D perovskite film (Fig. S13b†), indicating its better light stability than the Br/I mixed-halide perovskite. The operation stability of the single-junction quasi-2D PSC device under maximum power point (MPP) condition is presented in Fig. 1f. Under continuous 1 sun illumination in an ambient atmosphere with a humidity of about 50%, the encapsulated device exhibits almost invariable PCE value for 300 hours, which is conducive to ensure the operation stability of the quasi-2D perovskite front subcell based TSCs.
Performance optimization of quasi-2D perovskite/organic TSCs
Quasi-2D perovskite/organic TSCs with a device structure of ITO/poly-TPD modified NiOx (30 nm)/quasi-2D perovskite (300 nm)/PC61BM (15 nm)/BCP (8 nm)/Au (1 nm)/MoO3 (15 nm)/PM6:BTP-eC9 (100 nm)/PFN (5 nm)/Ag (100 nm) were fabricated (Fig. 2a). The PM6:BTP-eC9 based cell is suitable for the rear subcell because of its NIR light harvesting ability.36 The selection of active layer thickness refers to the single junction devices in the literature.55 Because of the integration of the absorption spectra of the perovskite and organic film (Fig. S12†), the light harvesting of the TSC device could be promoted, compared to the single junction device. Corresponding J–V curves are presented in Fig. S14† and the distribution of the photovoltaic parameters is shown in Fig. 2b. The Voc value decreases with the increase of the n value, which is similar to that of the single-junction PSC device (Fig. S10†). Jsc elevation can be detected when the n value increases from 3 to 3.5. Different from the single junction PSC device, further increasing the n value results in obvious decline of the photo-induced current, which can be attributed to the mismatch between the bandgaps of the active layers for the front and rear subcells, as supported by the EQE curves in Fig. S15.† With the red-shift of the absorption spectrum of the quasi-2D perovskite, the EQE of the perovskite front subcell increases while the EQE of the organic rear subcell decreases. The best TSC device based on the quasi-2D perovskite (n = 3.5) exhibits a PCE of 21.3% with a Voc of 2.06 V, a Jsc of 13.2 mA cm−2 and a FF of 78.3% (Fig. 2c), with the improved coverage of the solar spectra as shown in Fig. 2d. Almost no hysteresis can be observed.

The front perovskite (n = 3.5) and bottom organic subcells exhibit integrated Jsc values of 13.32 and 13.78 mA cm−2, respectively. The sum curve represents the total EQE of both front and bottom subcells in the tandem device. (e) Normalized PCE showing the long-term stability of encapsulated TSC and OSC devices continuously operated under white LED light sources (one-sun-equivalent, air atmosphere, humidity around 50%) in the MPP. T90 denotes the time after which the initial PCE has dropped to 90% of the initial value. 

Fig. 2d presents the stability of the TSC device under continuous 1 sun illumination in an air atmosphere. After 500 hours operation under the MPP condition, the device still retained 90% of the initial efficiency, much more stable than the organic single-junction PM6:BTP-eC9 device. The stability of the quasi-2D perovskite/organic TSC devices originates from the excellent stability of the quasi-2D perovskite, as the active layer of the front subcell (Fig. 1f), and the protection of the organic rear subcell from the UV irradiation by the quasi-2D perovskite film as the UV filter.28
Semi-empirical simulation for quasi-2D perovskite/organic TSCs
Here, in order to find out the PCE limit of the quasi-2D perovskite/organic TSCs with the structure of ITO/poly-TPD modified NiOx/BA1.8PE0.2MAn−1PbnI3n+1/PC61BM/BCP/Au/MoO3/PM6:BTP-eC9/PFN/Ag, the semi-empirical simulation is carried out from the experimental J–V characteristics of the subcells. The curves of Voc are plotted versus light intensity (Fig. 3a) to estimate the ideal FF. According to the relationship of Voc and Jsc of light intensity (Fig. 3b), an exponential J–V curve could be realized, which ideally follows the same functional dependence on voltage as the dark current–voltage curve of a diode without any series resistance. Then subtracting Jsc from this curve generates a pseudo-JV (p-JV)56,57 curve (Fig. 3c) that is only dependent on nonradiative recombination. The net current under illumination (equal to light current) is zero under the open-circuit condition, indicating that transport or series resistances are irrelevant. The pseudo FF (p-FF) achieved, about 85%, for cells based on quasi-2D perovskite is independent of the n value. This FF value is the practical up limit of the OSCs due to the serious non-radiative recombination.58–60 Thus, the FF values of the quasi-2D perovskite/organic TSCs can be assumed to be 85%.

(c) Pseudo-JV (p-JV) curves of the BA1.8PEA0.2MAn−1PbnI3n+1 devices. (d) EQEEL values of BA1.8PEA0.2MAn−1PbnI3n+1 perovskite devices in the light-emitting diode (LED) mode under different voltages. 
Next, the up limit of Voc, Voc,limit, for quasi-2D PSCs is quantitatively determined according to the formula Voc,limit = VSQoc − ΔVSQoc − ΔVradoc − ΔVnonradoc, where VSQoc is the Shockley–Queisser limit of Voc, ΔVSQoc is the Voc loss due to non-ideal EQE above the bandgap, and ΔVradoc and ΔVnonradoc are the Voc losses respectively induced by radiative and nonradiative recombination. The calculation process is displayed in ESI Note 1 and Fig. S16.† ΔVnonradoc can be determined by electroluminescence EQE (EQEEL) according to the equation  
From the curves shown in Fig. 3d and S17,† EQEEL values corresponding to the injection current equal to the short circuit current were obtained and are listed in Table S4,†,61–65 together with the calculated Vradoc, ΔVnonradoc, ΔVSQoc and Voc,limit. Next, according to the photovoltaic performance of the PM6:BTP-eC9 based OSC device (Fig. S18 and Table S5†), the Voc of the rear subcell can be assumed to be 0.84 V to calculate the Voc of the quasi-2D perovskite/organic TSCs, Voc,TSC, according to the formula of Voc,TSC = Voc,limit + 0.84.
The value of Jsc of TSCs is seriously affected by the light-harvesting feature of the subcells. Optical simulation was carried out to calculate the Jsc value for quasi-2D perovskite/organic TSCs based on active layers with various thicknesses and bandgaps. The simulation results shown in Fig. 4 reveal that the maximum Jsc of the quasi-2D perovskite/organic TSC devices could reach the values over 15 mA cm−2 (Table S6†), if the active layer of the organic rear subcell is thicker than 100 nm. However, previous reports show that the optimized active layer thickness of OSCs is about 80–100 nm because of the low carrier transport ability of the organics.66–68 Here, in Fig. 4 we have listed the simulated Jsc values of the TSC devices in the case of the 100 nm-thick organic active layer.

(a–e) Simulated current density as a function of the thicknesses of the front and rear subcells (the active layer of the front subcell is BA1.8PEA0.2MAn−1PbnI3n+1 film with different n values). (f) The maximum current density of the TSC devices with different n values based on the organic subcell with a 100 nm thick active layer. 
Thus, the theoretical photovoltaic performance of the TSCs applying BA1.8PEA0.2MAn−1PbnI3n+1 and PM6:BTP-eC9 film as the active layer of front and rear subcells can be calculated and the results are listed in Table 1. High Voc beyond 2.1 V and PCE limit of 28.09% could be achieved by using the n = 3.5 quasi-2D perovskite based front subcell. The experimental value of Jsc in Fig. 2 is lower than the simulated one, which could be attributed to the parasitic absorbance of the metal-nanoparticle layer on one hand, which introduces optical losses, lowers the EQE of the rear subcell and the overall Jsc of the tandem cell.27 Further optimizing the structure of the interconnecting layer and realizing ohmic contact between the front and rear subsells may elevate the value of Jsc, and Voc as well.28 On the other hand, improving the quality of the quasi-2D perovskite or preparing thicker quasi-2D perovskite film is another avenue towards higher photovoltaic performance.

Conclusions
We demonstrated the feasibility of constructing phase-segregation free perovskite/organic TSCs by selecting a quasi-2D perovskite as the active layer of the front subcell. Surface modification of NiOx by F4-TCNQ doped poly-TPD was proved to be effective in suppressing the energy loss, which elevates the Voc and PCE of the WBG quasi-2D perovskite solar cells. We finely adjusted the bandgap of the BA1.8PE0.2MAn−1PbnI3n+1 perovskite by tuning the n value to achieve matched light response between front and rear subcells. The optimized TSC device with the structure of ITO/poly-TPD modified NiOx/BA1.8PE0.2MA2.5Pb3.5I11.5/PC61BM/BCP/Au/MoO3/PM6:BTP-eC9/PFN/Ag exhibits a PCE of 21.3% with negligible hysteresis and outstanding operating stability. After 500 hour maximum power point tracking under continuous one-sun illumination in an air atmosphere with humidity around 50%, the PCE loss of the encapsulated device is less than 10%. The semi-empirical simulation indicates that the TSC device with the above-mentioned structure could achieve a high PCE of 28.09%. Further introducing WBG quasi-2D perovskites with higher PCE and new NBG organics is required for further development of perovskite/organic TSCs.

PEDOT:PSS (Clevios PVP 4083) was purchased from Heraeus Inc., Germany.
Fabrication of quasi-2D perovskite front cells
ITO-coated glass substrates were cleaned sequentially in detergent (Hellmanex III, 2 vol%), deionized water, acetone, and isopropanol in an ultrasonic bath for 15 min, respectively. Thereafter, the substrates were dried under a nitrogen flow and cleaned using UV-ozone treatment for 20 min before use. Nickel(II) nitrate hexahydrate (Ni(NO3)2·6H2O) was dissolved in ethylene glycol solution containing 1 M nickel(II) nitrate hexahydrate with ethylenediamine (Aldrich). The solution was spin-cast onto the prepared substrate at 4000 rpm for 40 s to obtain the NiOx substrate. Then, the substrate was transferred to the hot plate with the temperature of 300 °C in ambient air for 60 min. Then the cooled substrates were transferred into a glovebox for deposition and further device fabrication. PTAA (2 mg ml−1 in toluene) or F4-TCNQ doped poly-TPD (1 mg ml−1 in toluene with 0.04 mg F4-TCNQ) was spin-coated onto the NiOx surface at 4000 rpm for 40 s, followed by annealing at 100 °C for 10 min. BAI, PEAI, MAI, and PbI2 were mixed in the molar ratio of 1.8:0.2:(n − 1):n (n = 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5) in DMF (with 3% formamide addition) at a concentration of 0.5 M (based on PbI2). The perovskite precursor solution and substrates coated with the modified NiOx were heated to 70 °C and 100 °C, respectively, before the spin-coating of the perovskite layer. The spin-coating process was initiated at 4000 rpm for 30 s after dropping the hot perovskite precursor onto the preheated substrate, with 150 ml of toluene added to the perovskite at 10 s, and then PC61BM (6 mg ml−1 in chloroform) was spin-coated on the perovskite film at 2000 rpm for 30 s, followed by annealing at 100 °C for 10 min. BCP was then spin-coated on PC61BM at 4000 rpm for 30 s, followed by depositing 100 nm of Ag in a vacuum chamber at a high vacuum pressure of 3 × 10−4 Pa.
Fabrication of organic solar cells
The ITO glass substrates were prepared by the same procedure as before. The precleaned ITO substrates were treated in an ultraviolet ozone generator for 10 min, followed by deposition of PEDOT:PSS. After baking the PEDOT:PSS layer in air at 150 °C for 10 min, the substrates were transferred to a glovebox. PBDB-TF and BTP-eC9 were used as the donor and acceptor, respectively. The active layer was spin coated from 17.6 mg ml−1 solution dissolved in chloroform (D:A = 1:1.2, 0.25% v/v DIO) at 2200 rpm for 30 s to form an active layer. Then the devices were annealed at 100 °C for 10 min. Later, when the film cooled to the room temperature, a layer of PFN-Br (0.5 mg ml−1 in methanol) was deposited by spin coating at 3500 rpm for 20 s. Then the silver electrode was deposited by thermal evaporation under a base pressure of 1 × 10−4 Pa at the speed of 2 Å s−1. The active cell area of our device is 0.06 cm2, and the aperture for measurement is 0.0473 cm2, which is certified by the National Institute of Metrology (NIM) and Fujian Metrology Institute.
Fabrication of quasi-2D perovskite/organic TSCs
After deposition of the quasi-2D perovskite, PC61BM and BCP, 1 nm thin Au layer and 15 nm MoOx were evaporated sequentially. Then, the organic active layer and PFN-Br layer were spin coated by the same process as the fabrication of the single-junction organic solar cell.
Fabrication of FA0.6MA0.4PbI1.8Br1.2 solar cells and 3D perovskite/organic TSCs. Details of the process of fabricating FA0.6MA0.4PbI1.8Br1.2 solar cells and 3D perovskite/organic TSCs can be found in this paper.30
Solar cell characterization
The J–V measurement was performed via a solar simulator (SS-F5-3A, Enlitech) along with AM 1.5G spectra whose intensity was calibrated by the certified standard silicon solar cell (SRC-2020, Enlitech) at 100 mW cm−2. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) data were obtained by using the solar-cell spectral-response measurement system (QE-R, Enlitech). For EQE measurement of tandem cells, the WBG perovskite front subcells were measured while saturating the organic rear subcells with continuous light from a halogen lamp with an 805 nm polarized optical filter, while the organic rear subcells were measured while saturating the perovskite front subcells with continuous light from a halogen lamp with a 505nm polarized optical filter. No bias voltage was applied for the EQE measurement of both subcells.
EQEEL measurement
Electroluminescence (EL) quantum efficiency (EQEEL) measurements were performed by applying external voltage sources through the devices from 0.8 V to 1.5 V. A Keithley 2400 SourceMeter was used for supplying voltages and recording the injected current, and a Keithley 485 Picoammeter was used for measuring the emitted light intensity.
Conductivity measurement
The conductivities of the different HTLs were measured with the structure ITO/NiOx/HTLs/Au. The direct current conductivity (σ0) can be calculated from the slope of I–V curves, using the equation I = σ0Ad−1V, where d is the thickness of the thin films and A is the area of the sample (8.35 mm2).
Accelerated operational lifetime testing
Encapsulated PVSCs are measured under continuous 1sun-equivalent illumination provided by an LED lamp in open air with a humidity about 50%.
Optical simulations
The algorithm of the optical model is based on the transfer matrix formalism model (TMM). This theory assumes that all layers are homogeneous and their interfaces are flat and parallel so that each layer can be described by its thickness and optical constant. Complex refractive index (N = n + k × i), which consists of the refractive index (n value) and extinction coefficient (k value) and all of these parameters can be determined by spectroscopic ellipsometry (ME-L ellipsometer, Wuhan Eoptics Technology). The probed wavelength range of Psi and Delta is 300–1000 nm. In general, we first use the Cauchy model to fit the transparent region of the solar cell. Then, B-spline is used for the remaining part. After that, the parameterization is performed with combinations of the Tauc–Lorentz model and Gaussian model. Finally, the film thickness, incidence angle, roughness, and all model parameters are optimized simultaneously for a small enough mean square error (MSE).
Other characteristics
The UV-visible absorption spectra and transmittance spectra were obtained via a U-4100 (HITACHI) UV-vis spectrophotometer. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were measured by using a Rigaku D/max-2550PC X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (1.5406 nm). Film morphologies and cross-sectional images of films were characterized using SEM (Quanta 400). UPS measurements were carried out on an ESCALAB 250Xi (Thermo) system, the energy of the incident light energy for UPS measurement is 21.22 eV. The steady-state PL and TRPL spectra were both obtained with an FLSP920 spectrofluorometer at excitation wavelengths of 470 and 405nm, respectively.
