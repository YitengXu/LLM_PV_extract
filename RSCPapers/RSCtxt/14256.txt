1. Introduction
Lanthanoid complexes formed between lanthanoid ions (Ln3+) and organic ligands display intriguing luminescence features such as sharp emission lines, longer decay times, and large Stokes’ shift, which make them very important for a wide range of applications.1–5 However, the full exploitation of the complexes in practical applications has been severely hampered by their inherent drawbacks like low thermal and photochemical stability, poor mechanical and conduction properties, as well as the tendency to aggregate. Incorporation of lanthanoid complexes into various matrices to prepare luminescent organic–inorganic hybrid materials is one of the acceptable ways to overcome the aforementioned shortcomings, which has been an area of great interest during the past few decades.6–18
Zeolites which are crystalline aluminosilcates with pores of molecular dimensions are ideal hosts for accommodating lanthanoid complexes to construct luminescent hybrid materials, featuring interesting luminescence performances, improved stability, tunable morphology and size, versatile organizations, facile modifications and functions, to name a few.12,13,18–23 For instance, luminescent materials with tunable emission colors were facilely achieved by simply doping Ln3+ ions and an organic sensitizer in the cavities of zeolite Y. For instance, Wada and coworkers achieved successfully tunable full-color emissions from violet to blue, green, and red by changing the amount of Ln3+ ions and the nature of the sensitizer and the energy transfer between them.12 This is because of zeolites offering the advantage of precisely locating their guests at crystallographic cation sites in nanosized pores, which could not be available for a fluid solution.22,23 The above study displays important and potential application in the temperature sensor and full color display field. Luminescent materials showing remarkable luminescence enhancement upon treatment with water vapor were prepared by inserting europium(III) β-deketonate complexes in the cavities of zeolite Y,10 which offers highly interesting and important foundation for the preparation of novel luminescence materials in the presence of an environmentally friendly solvent because typically H2O can effectively quench Eu3+ luminescence. Effective NIR luminescence was also readily achieved by incorporating decafluorobenzophenone (DFB) molecules into the channels of Er3+ exchanged zeolite L (ZL), where effective energy transfer from DFB to Er3+ is observed owing to their matching energy levels although the formation of a stable Er3+–DFB complex is unfavorable.20 These exemplary works highlighted above demonstrate the potential of using zeolites as hosts in the preparation of luminescent materials. Although we have published a primary review concerning this recently,9 a review article summarizing the updated research results of luminescent materials resulting from the combination of lanthanoid complexes and zeolite crystals is highly desirable because of the rapid progress ever made in this field, i.e., the investigation on the potential applications of the materials in luminescence sensing24 and LED lighting.25
In the present article, we mainly review our systematic efforts to develop luminescent hybrid materials by modifying zeolites with lanthanoid complexes, and studies conducted by other groups are also included where it is necessary. The strategy to modify zeolites with lanthanoid complexes to produce luminescent hybrid materials is comprehensively summarized. The stability of lanthanoid complexes incorporated within the pores of zeolites is summarized, and the higher organization of the hybrid materials into oriented zeolite monolayers with ordered structures is also mentioned. Our emphasis is especially placed on understanding the influence of the microenvironments of the void spaces on the luminescence performances of the encapsulated lanthanoid complexes. The aforementioned studies have important implications for optimizing the luminescence of the resulting hybrid materials, which have potential application as luminescent sensors.
2. Synthesis
Luminescent hybrid materials based on lanthanoid complexes and zeolites can be facilely prepared via several methods. According to the research studies reported by us and other groups, four main approaches have been developed to prepare luminescent hybrid materials: inside function, closure of the pore opening with an organic sensitizer, inside–outside double functions, and embedding the hybrid materials within matrices.
2.1 Inside function
Due to their relatively bulky size compared with the pore openings of zeolites, the complexes were typically encapsulated within the pores via the so-called ‘ship in a bottle’ strategy.26 For instance, the lanthanoid ions (Ln3+) were inserted through the ion exchange procedure followed by loading of the organic sensitizer through the diffusion method, and then the complexes of appropriate coordination numbers were in situ formed in the pores.27,28 The current frequently used organic sensitizers for insertion into the pores of zeolites to prepare luminescent hybrid materials are presented in Fig. 1. The resulting materials exhibit emissions spanning the visible and near infrared spectral region, and even white color can be observed for some cases. In addition, their emission colors can be easily tuned by changing the excitation wavelengths, the nature of sensitizers, the Ln3+/sensitizer ratio, the kind of Ln3+, and the molar ratio of different Ln3+ ions. This synthesis procedure is shown in Fig. 2, where Ln3+ is Eu3+ or Tb3+ and the 2,2-bipyridine was used as the organic sensitizer.29

2.2 Closure of the pore opening with an organic sensitizer
In the “ship in a bottle” procedure, the insertion of organic ligands within the pores of zeolites was typically carried out by the rigorous exclusion of water in a sealed container under the conditions of heating and vacuum. The opening of the pore entrance allows the molecule inside the pores to easily go out and those outside the pores to readily enter in, thus substantially affecting the luminescence performances of the final materials. Stopcock-like molecules capable of selectively sealing the entrances can resolve the problem to a large extent.46 A facile and effective method to incorporate organic sensitizers which can both sensitize the luminescence of Eu3+ and seal the channel entrances of ZL was recently developed by Li et al.45 The Eu3+-exchanged ZL was modified with a stopcock-like organic sensitizer (Si-TTA) consisting of reactive silane groups and a light-absorbing moiety capable of coordinating and sensitizing Eu3+ ions in THF solution under heating conditions (Fig. 3). The diketone moieties can penetrate into the channels while the silane moieties which are too large to penetrate into the channels can react with Si–OH groups located at the entrances to form Si–O–Si bonds,47–49 and thus the entrances are at least partially sealed. The luminescence properties (emission intensity, 5D0 lifetime, 5D0 radiative (kr) probabilities and 5D0 quantum efficiency (q) of Eu3+) are highly dependent on the ratio of length to diameter of the zeolite employed, and zeolites with a higher ratio of length to diameter lead to luminescent materials showing poor luminescence performance, which is due to the formation of europium(III) β-diketonate complexes mainly located at the entrances of the channels. Replacement of Si-TTA with a silylated terpyridine (Terpy-Si) can also be effective.49

2.3 Inside–outside double functions
In addition to being encapsulated within the pores of zeolites, lanthanoid complexes can also be supported outside of the pores via various methods. Yan and co-workers reported luminescent hybrid materials obtained by the so-called inside–outside double modification path,36,50,51i.e., one kind of lanthanoid complexes were loaded within the pores while another kind of lanthanoid complexes were located on the outer surface of the zeolites. They firstly inserted Nd or Yb complexes of 1,3-diphenylpropane-1,3-dione (DBM) into the pores of zeolite and then tethered Eu complexes of 1-(2-naphthoyl)-3,3,3-trifluoroacetonate (NTA) on the outer surface of the zeolite crystals via Si–C covalent bonds; the resulting materials show luminescence in both visible and NIR spectral regions under ultraviolet excitation (as shown in Fig. 4).36 Lanthanoid polyoxometalates were also used to modify the outer surface of zeolites. Eu3+–TTA and Tb–AA complexes were firstly introduced into the pores of zeolite A (L), and then Na9LnW10O36·32H2O (LnW10) was assembled onto the surface of zeolite A (L) through a carboxyl-functionalized ionic liquid coordinated to titania. The procedure is shown in Fig. 5. The prepared hybrids show multi-color luminescence for different composition and excitation.34 Similar hybrid materials were further reported by the same group using 1-methyl-3-(trimethoxysilyl)propyl chloride (IM+ Cl) as a double linker.51 Furthermore, positively charged lanthanoid complexes can be selectively placed at the opening entrances of ZL channels to achieve the inside–outside double modification of ZL, in a similar way to the reported stopcock that can plug in the channel entrances.46 A positively charged europium(III) complex can be used to selectively adsorb on the opening entrances of ZL, inside the channels of which terbium complexes can be inserted. Thus, luminescent hybrid materials show different emission colors when changing the excitation wavelength41 (Fig. 6).

2.4 Embedding the hybrid materials within matrices
The luminescent hybrid materials obtained by modifying zeolites with lanthanoid complexes can be further embedded into matrices like silica and polymers, which can further protect the hybrid materials, make further modification of them much more easier and versatile, and afford them extra features such as high transparency. Li and co-workers prepared interesting core–shell structured hybrid materials by coating europium(III) β-diketonate complex-loaded ZL (Eu3+(TTAn)-ZL) with a silica shell according to the reported procedure (Fig. 7).52,53 The formation of the silica shell on ZL crystals was well demonstrated by SEM images and XPS spectra. It is noteworthy that the presence of the shell can well prevent leakage of guest species such as TTA from the channels of ZL and can also make further modification of the core–shell structured materials much easier and available.

So far, most of the zeolite-based hybrid materials are in the form of powder, and thus the aggregation of zeolite crystals frequently occurs and they can also scatter light in the visible spectral region, which can seriously hamper their optical applications. Therefore, making zeolite-based hybrid materials transparent is highly important and desirable for the fabrication of various photonic devices. Embedding nanosized hybrid materials within transparent polymers such as PMMA is an applicable and effective method to produce transparent luminescent materials. Li et al.54,55 reported transparent and luminescent hybrid materials by embedding nanosized zeolite L (NZL) with lanthanoid complexes contained in their channels according to the strategy reported previously (Fig. 8).56 The transparent materials were prepared by copolymerization of MMA with methacryloxymethyltrimethoxysilane modified NZL containing Eu- or Tb-complexes. The emission color of the transparent materials can be tuned by simply changing the complexes inside the channels. Furthermore, the PMMA polymer can protect from luminescence quenching by water. This study opens the door for zeolite-based hybrid materials to be used in the preparation of plastic photonic devices.

3. Improved stability
The basic purpose of incorporating lanthanoid complexes within the pores of zeolite materials is to enhance their thermal- and photo-stability. The first sample showing improved thermal-stability was reported by Song,28 who observed obviously improved thermal-stability for the encapsulated Eu(DBM)3bath complexes within the nanochannels of ZL. Li et al.29 inserted terbium(III) 2,2′-bipyridine complexes inside the channels of zeolite L to form Tb3+(bpy)n-ZL, which displayed four strong narrow lines after heat treatment at 400 °C for 4 h, only losing 20% of its emission intensity (Fig. 9). This is highly interesting and important since most of the lanthanoid complexes under such harsh conditions could not emit meaningful emission due to the decomposition of their organic ligand. Actually, most of the narrow lines of the pure complexes upon heating at 150 °C disappeared. This indicates the great role played by ZL in enhancing the thermal-stability of the encapsulated LnCs. In addition, obviously enhanced photo-stability was also achieved for europium(III) β-diketonate complexes encapsulated within the channels of ZL by the same group.19

4. Oriented monolayers
A high degree of supramolecular organization is a prerequisite and highly important for attaining the desired macroscopic properties in device chemistry.57 The assembly of zeolite crystals into oriented monolayers is one of the acceptable ways to achieve a high level of organization for zeolite-based organic–inorganic hybrid materials.58–60
Oriented ZL monolayers with tunable luminescence characteristics of Ln3+ ions in which all of the zeolite crystals with the c-axis are perpendicular to the surface of substrates were also reported by Li and co-workers.11,13,32,61 The channels remain open on the side that is not blocked, leading to the so-called c-oriented open-channel monolayers. The openness of the channels makes it possible to insert guests into the channels leading to interesting materials with exciting properties like electronic excitation energy transfer in one direction only.62,63 A higher organization and luminescence of oriented ZL monolayers was achieved by using functional linkers. They can coordinate and sensitize Ln3+, and can self-assemble on the substrate through hydrogen bonding with reactive groups available for binding zeolite crystals via covalent bonds. The emission color of the forming complex was easily tuned by changing the amount and type of Ln3+ ions in the linker, by changing the lanthanoid complexes inside the channels of ZL, and by changing the excitation wavelength (Fig. 10).11,13 Similar monolayers with a highly ordered structure were also obtained by using 1 as the functional linker. Additionally, the introduction of Eu3+ ions further improved the coverage and denser packing and the luminescence performances, which also favor the standing of the linker molecules on the substrate through the coordination between Eu3+ ions and the diketone moieties in linker 1. Coating polymers on the monolayers can make them completely transparent and thus can eliminate light scattering which is normally undesirable in photonic devices (Fig. 11).14,56 In addition to covalent bonding, the coordinative interactions between metal ions and organic ligands was also employed to fabricate luminescent oriented zeolite L monolayers.14

Depending on the cations employed, the resulting monolayers can show red, green and blue emitting light. Various applications of oriented ZL monolayers can be envisaged, ranging from biology, diagnostics, optical and electro-optical devices, and photoelectron chemistry to solar energy conversion.64–67
5. Luminescence enhancement of hybrid materials
As is well known, abundant acidic sites inside the channels (or cavities) of Ln3+-doped zeolites due to the cationic hydrolysis, as displayed in eqn (1),68,69 are harmful to the luminescence efficiency of lanthanoid complexes incorporated within zeolites. This fact has long been neglected although Calzaferri and coworkers have carefully studied the influence of proton activity inside the channels of ZL on the photophysical properties of encapsulated dyes.68,69 Li et al. recently observed the luminescence enhancement of europium(III) β-diketonate in the channels of ZL (Eu3+(TTAn)-ZL, TTA = 2-thenoyltrifluoroacetone) upon treatment with ammonia vapor, and the lifetime of Eu3+ excited state was accordingly increased,19,33 which is due to the neutralization of the acidic sites by the basic ammonia and thus the more stable LnCs with a higher coordination number form according to eqn (2)–(4). In a subsequent report,32 they observed a very surprising luminescence enhancement of the Eu3+-β-diketonate modified nanozeolite L (Eu3+(TTAn)-NZL) after modification with a stopper 2 (see Fig. 12), which bears a positively charged part and can easily enter the negatively charged NZL-channel upon exchanging a neighbor cation, and the bulky triethoxysilane moiety can react with the OH groups presented at the channel entrances to close the channel entrances. Compared with Eu3+(TTAn)-NZL, the modified sample exhibits remarkably enhanced luminescence intensity (Fig. 12b), since the presence of 2 decreases the proton strength in the ZL channels, thus favoring the deprotonation of the TTA ligand and the full coordination between Eu3+ and the ligand. Additionally, their emission intensities can increase with the increase of 2 (Fig. 13), which is because the alkaline property of 2 can decrease the proton strength inside the channels through neutralization. Similar luminescence enhancement was also observed in Nd3+(TTAn)-NZL and Er3+(TTAn)-NZL.70 The mechanism is that the presence of the imidazolium-based stopper is favorable to the sustainable formation of Eu3+-β-diketonate complexes with high coordination by decreasing the proton strength inside the channels of NZL, which is similar to the effect of ammonia treatment.33 Ammonia escapes, however, quickly under ambient conditions and the improvement is therefore not sustainable. Thus, modification with a stopper can be regarded as a sustainable way to boost the luminescence of Eu3+(TTAn)-NZL, which can also substantially prevent luminescence quenching of Eu3+ by smaller molecules such as H2O from outside as revealed by the fact that the aqueous suspension of the stopper-modified sample still shows bright luminescence while the ammonia-treated one does not (Fig. 14). Furthermore, we also believe that the penetration of positively charged parts into the channels leads to the release of H+ from channels via the ion exchange procedure, which can be indirectly verified by using the same stopper to modify hybrid materials consisting of Eu3+(TTAn) and LAPONITE® clay ((TTAn)@Lap) as we will discuss below. (1) (2) (3) Eu3+ + nDK ⇌ [Eu3+(DK)n]3−n(4)

LAPONITE® clay can be completely delaminated to individual disks when dispersed in water. It has been reported that abundant acidic sites are available on the surface of the individual delaminated platelets,71 which is similar to the case of the aforementioned NZL and might negatively influence the luminescence behavior of lanthanoid complexes on the LAPONITE® platelets. Therefore, a similar luminescence-boosting effect was observed in the luminescent hybrid material (TTAn)@Lap by Yang et al.72 They observed that the addition of 2 to Eu3+(TTAn)@Lap in aqueous solution leads to a remarkable luminescence enhancement of the nanohybrid, and the absolute quantum efficiency of this was determined to be ∼0.7, a high value that has rarely been observed for luminescent hybrid materials under aqueous conditions. Besides, several other organic ionic salts containing imidazolium and pyridinium moieties can also significantly enhance the luminescence efficiency of such hybrid materials, even though they have weak acidity. The mechanism responsible for enhancing the luminescence is that the addition of these organic salts can remove the protons on the platelets through a mechanism of synergic effect of ion exchange and neutralization (for a basic one like 2). The removal of H+ from the platelets was also verified by measuring the pH of the aqueous suspension of Eu3+(TTAn)@Lap before and after the addition of the organic salt 2.
6. Sensing applications of hybrid materials
Zeolites usually have accessible void spaces and the luminescent complexes can locate within the spaces, which featuring excellent optical properties, which makes them highly promising in designing luminescent sensors for detecting chemical substances. In this section, we will highlight the application of such kind of luminescent hybrid materials in the field of luminescence sensing, especially those made by our group.
The hybrid nanocomposite Eu3+(TTAn)-NZL can be used as an effective luminescence sensor for basic amines, showing a condition selective luminescence turn-on response to basic molecule vapors due to the neutralization of acidic sites inside the channels and the formation of complexes with higher coordination numbers.73 Basic molecule vapors such as ammonia, triethylamine (Et3N), tert-butylamine (t-BuNH2) and n-butylamine can induce obvious enhancement in luminescence intensity. In addition, the order of luminescence boost for these amines was Et3N > t-BuNH2 > n-BuNH2 > NH3, which is fully in accordance with the trend of the pKa of the corresponding conjugate acids (Fig. 15b). The aforementioned observations further indicate that the alkaline property of amines can decrease the proton strength inside the channels through neutralization and hence favor the formation of Eu3+-β-diketonate complexes with high coordination numbers. With respect to the lifetime of Eu3+ ions and the absolute quantum yield, the response is very rapid (within 20 s) and evident. The turn-on luminescence response can be switched-off by acidic vapors (Fig. 15). However, an unavoidable drawback for Eu3+(TTAn)-NZL is that single-color emission was usually influenced by sensor concentration and excitation power in practical applications, which can be solved by using the self-referencing dual-emission luminescent sensor.74,75 Li et al.24 developed a luminescent platform consisting of the (Eu3+/Tb3+) heteroatom complex encapsulated within the channels of NZL, denoted as Eu4Tb6(acac)n@NZL (acac = acetylacetone), which can be used to quickly identify amines as each of the amine solvents (with larger pKa values) has a unique characteristic readout of IEu/ITb, making an excellent fingerprint correlation between the amine (with larger pKa values) and the emission intensity ratio (IEu/ITb) as well as the emission color of the sensor (Fig. 16).

The effective detection of ethylenediamine via a facile method is highly desirable due to its widespread use in various chemical industries, making it a potential threat to human health. Li et al. developed a facile and scalable way to obtain a solid luminescent material by encapsulating Tb(acacn) complexes within the cavities of zeolite Y, displaying obvious changes in luminescence colors triggered by solvent vapors, with excellent selectivity for ethylenediamine vapor.42 The resulting material shows weak green and blue emission when excited by a 302 nm and a 365 nm light, respectively. Of the vapors of various solvents, ethylenediamine can enhance the green emission to the most extent when excited at 302 nm, while the emission color of the hybrid material changes from weak green to bright blue upon contact with the vapors of ethylenediamine when illuminated with a 365 nm light, and most of other solvents can only lead to weak green light with different brightness.
The luminescent sensor discussed above typically adopts the “lock-and-key” principle that requires specific interactions between the receptors and analytes, which is less powerful in the identification of a multi-analyte system. Alternatively, sensor-array technology (also called chemical nose/tongue) which responds to the analyte in a similar way to the mammalian olfactory system is more favorable for the detection and recognition of diverse analytes. A small sensor array of three sensing elements which can accomplish the identification of a group of 13 different amine molecules and isomers of some amines was recently reported by Li et al. (Fig. 17).44 The sensing elements were obtained by loading Eu–Tb binuclear complexes with hexafluoroacetylacetonate (HFA) within the cavities of zeolite Y (ZY): Eu0.5Tb9.5(HFA)n@ZY, Eu1Tb9(HFA)n@ZY, and Eu2Tb8(HFA)n@ZY. The identification can be performed by collective luminescence variation of these sensor elements caused by different amine molecules. Moreover, the detection of the amine concentration in water and the individual amines in a mixed sample can also be accomplished by such a sensor array.

7. Conclusions and outlook
In this account, we highlight our systematic efforts to develop luminescent hybrid materials by modifying zeolites with lanthanoid complexes, and studies conducted by other groups are also included where it is necessary. Four main approaches were employed to modify zeolites with lanthanoid complexes to produce luminescent hybrid materials: inside functions, closure of the pore opening with an organic sensitizer, inside–outside double functions, and embedding the hybrid materials within matrices. Our emphasis is especially placed on understanding the influence of microenvironments of the void spaces on the luminescence performances of the encapsulated lanthanoid complexes. The aforementioned studies have important implications for optimizing the luminescence of the resulting hybrid materials, which have potential application as luminescent sensors. Stopcock-like molecules (silane-containing imidazolium salt with alkaline property) capable of selectively sealing the entrances can improve luminescence performance by neutralizing the proton activity inside the channels of ZL, which also can form luminescence color tunable oriented ZL monolayers with the c-axis perpendicular to the surface of substrates and obtain inside–outside double materials by preventing from water quenching. Additionally, embedding the hybrid materials within matrices like silica and polymers affords them extra features such as high transparency benefiting from the protective effects of matrices, which opens the door for application in plastic photonic devices. Particularly, we use the accessible void spaces characteristic of luminescent materials based on lanthanoid complexes and zeolites to develop single-emission sensors, dual-emission sensors and small sensor arrays, achieving rapid detection (within 20 s) of basic molecule vapors. The aforementioned study further indicates that the alkaline property of amines can decrease the proton strength inside the channels through neutralization and hence favor the formation of Eu3+-β-diketonate complexes with high coordination numbers. Especially, a dual-emission sensor can make an excellent fingerprint correlation between amine solvents through unique characteristic readout of IEu/ITb by tuning the energy transfer from the ligand to Eu3+ and/or from Tb3+ to Eu3+. And a small sensor array can accomplish the identification of multiplex amine molecules, amine concentrations in water and individual amines in a mixed amine sample, displaying important application for the detection and recognition of diverse analytes. In brief, the research of luminescent materials based on lanthanoid complexes and zeolites has made important advancement. However, some efforts still need to be made in the following aspects in the future: (1) the coordination form and coordination number of lanthanoid complexes within the cavities of zeolites still require an in-depth investigation. (2) The detection limit of the above sensors needs to be further improved. (3) The application of luminescent materials based on lanthanoid complexes and zeolites in various fields such as white LED lighting, display and solar cells remains to be broadened.
