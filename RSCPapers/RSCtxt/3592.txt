    , Accepted 6th February 2020First published on 6th February 2020AbstractAs a “hot” member of two-dimensional (2D) materials, black phosphorus (BP) has received growing interest in a variety of fields in physics, chemistry, materials, and biomedicine since 2014. Owing to the exclusive 2D layered structure, some fantastic properties such as tunable band structure, high charge mobility, and in-plane anisotropy provide BP with great potential for application in electronic/optoelectronic devices, energy source conversion and storage, etc. However, with in-depth investigations, the performance deficiencies of BP-based devices are exposed, originating from the poor chemical stability of BP. To address the above issues, a variety of BP/carbon hybrid composites have been constructed as an emerging type of multifunctional materials by the integration of the unique properties of carbon materials with the merits of BP into a single hybrid heterostructure, showing improved performance for applications.

1. Introduction
2D materials with layered structure show exotic electronic properties, excellent mechanical flexibility and high specific surface areas, distinguishing from their bulk counterparts when the crystal thickness is scaled down to a few nanometers or less (single layer or few-layer) and therefore attract increasing interest from both the academic and industrial communities.1–5 Typically, the past fifteen years have witnessed the great success of graphene from fundamental research to industrial applications since it was discovered in 2004 by Novoselov and Geim, originating from its unique and exceptional structural, optical, and electronic properties including the quantum hall effect, high electron mobility, strong mechanical strength, excellent optical transparency, intriguing thermal conductivity, etc.6–13 However, the nature of the zero bandgap in graphene makes it unsuitable for low-standby-power-dissipated logical circuits working at room temperature.14,15 Usually, a low on/off current ratio is a big problem in graphene field-effect transistors (FETs). Afterwards, transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) were explored as alternative candidates for zero-bandgap graphene.16–22 As is well known, MoS2 is the most representative one of TMDs, which has been widely studied for applications in optoelectronic and energy storage devices during the past decade because it possesses an indirect bandgap of 1.8 eV for monolayers and 1.2 eV for multilayers.23–25 Especially, MoS2 FETs deliver excellent on/off current ratios.26 However, a serious drawback of the MoS2 semiconductor material comes from its extremely low carrier mobility. Moreover, the wide and indirect bandgap hinders the utilization of solar light with a longer wavelength, limiting the conversion of solar energy. Hence, novel 2D semiconductors offering a promising bandgap between graphene and TMDs are highly desirable to mitigate the issues appearing in graphene and TMD optoelectronic devices. Fortunately, the goal has come true since the 2D structure of BP was identified in 2014.
White, red and black phosphorus are the allotropes of the phosphorus element, in which white and red phosphorus are two more common allotropes and extensively used as industrial chemicals, while the third allotrope form, BP, is not well known.27,28 Indeed, BP was discovered 105 years ago. The Nobel Prize Winner, Prof. Bridgman achieved success in the synthesis of the BP bulk by the phase transition of white phosphorus at ultrahigh pressure (1.2 GPa) in 1914 for the first time.27 Although great efforts were devoted to the preparation of the BP bulk, with regard to realizing much milder synthetic conditions, a deeper understanding of BP was rarely reported.29–32 Until 2014, groundbreaking research on FETs using few-layer BP nanosheets exfoliated successfully by the sticky-tape technique demonstrated an ultrahigh on/off current ratio of 105, and BP joined the scientific community of the 2D material family.33 As is well known, white phosphorus has a molecular formula of P4, in which the P atoms in the molecule form a tetrahedron with six single bonds so that each atom has three bonds with its neighbors via sp3 hybridization. Normally, bond angles of around 109.5° should be formed during the hybridization, but it is decreased to 60° because of the molecular structure of P4, giving rising to the high activity of white phosphorus. For the conversion of white phosphorus into BP, three out of six bonds in P4 are broken, forming a tripod-like structure. Accordingly, the angles between the remaining bonds become larger, making BP more stable. These flattened P4 blocks form the BP layer by having their single bonded atoms link up with two atoms from other blocks. Therefore, multilayer BP possesses weak interlayer van der Waals interactions and strong intralayer bonding. Moreover, the spacing between the adjacent layers is about 0.53 nm (Fig. 1A).34 Although the P4 tetrahedron is partially flattened, the sp3 hybridization character is still inherited in BP. Consequently, monolayer BP does not present a flat layer structure but a puckered honeycomb one (Fig. 1B).35 Moreover, the local bonding configurations are different along the armchair (AM) and zigzag (ZZ) directions. Specifically, the bond angle is 103.3° with a P–P bond length of 2.287 Å along the AM direction, while they are 94.3° and 2.253 Å along the ZZ direction, respectively. This unique structural anisotropy results in high in-plane anisotropic physical properties,36–39 which differ from those of other 2D materials (Fig. 1C).35,40–44 This impressive property makes BP more attractive for various applications including in novel electronic devices.45–47 On the other hand, BP is demonstrated to be a direct-bandgap semiconductor with a thickness-dependent bandgap. Monolayer BP is confirmed to show the largest bandgap of 2.0 eV (Fig. 1D).43 The bandgap reduces to around 0.3 eV finally for the bulk counterpart as the layer thickness increases (Fig. 1E). Such a unique bandgap structure provides a highly desirable opportunity for FET applications with better drain current modulation and mobility compared to FETs based on other 2D materials.33 In addition, the narrow bandgap implies that BP can operate as a promising light absorber for harvesting solar energy as well. Another attractive feature of BP is high hole-dominant mobility. Typically, 10 nm-thick BP sheets exhibit a hole mobility of 1000 cm2 V−1 s−1 at room temperature, making it better than the commercial Si for p-channel transistors, which just has a hole mobility of no more than 450 cm2 V−1 s−1.48 Besides the semiconducting properties, BP also shows biocompatibility and biodegradability, making it suitable for biomedical applications.49–53 Very shortly, BP received worldwide attention as a versatile material for various applications in electronics,54–57 optoelectronics,58–67 sensing,68–70 energy storage and conversion,71,72 biomedicine,73,74etc.

Despite the attractive potential for applications, it was found that the performance of BP-based devices can't keep stable. Especially, the performance degraded obviously after a few days under ambient conditions.75 Such a degradation of performance is dominantly associated with the poor chemical stability of BP. To solve the above-mentioned problems, researchers began to employ plausible strategies based on surface passivation for protecting BP against degradation by surface passivation. For example, the inorganic layer of Al2O3 or SiO2 on BP was demonstrated to be effective in keeping the BP-based FET performance stable.76,77 However, there is no literature demonstrating whether it still works for other applications, especially for electrochemical energy conversion and storage. By contrast, hybrid composites composed of BP and carbon materials including graphene are emerging as a kind of multifunctional materials, presenting excellent stability and performance in broad applications.78 During the past five years, lots of research achievements related to BP/carbon hybrid composites have been demonstrated, taking us a step closer to real-world applications of BP.78–82 Nevertheless, there are few review papers focusing on this kind of BP/carbon hybrid composite from stability improvement and synthesis to applications systematically. We believe that an in-time review will provide helpful insights for the future developments of BP/carbon hybrid composites in this exciting field. Here, we aim to describe recent progress in the study of BP/carbon hybrid composites as a new type of functional materials focusing on the synthesis and improved stability for applications in electrochemical energy storage, water splitting and electronic/optoelectronic devices.
2. Improved stability
2.1. Chemical degradation
Despite BP being the most thermodynamically stable allotrope, its air instability is still a big concern, affecting its semiconducting properties toward wide applications. It was found that the degradation rate of BP is related to its thickness.75,83–85 Specifically, bulk BP can survive in the ambient environment for a few months, but few-layer BP exhibits serious degradation within a few days when exposed to air. This implies that an inert environment is necessary for the exfoliation of BP from bulk to few layers. The chemical degradation of materials can be usually associated with the change of their microstructures. Generally, the surface of ideal oxidization-free BP is smooth. However, many small bumps were observed clearly using an AFM on the surface of BP sheets after being exposed to the ambient environment shortly (Fig. 2A).85 A few days later we can see that the surface of BP turned much coarser and large droplets were clearer because of the chemical degradation. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) characterization revealed that surface oxidation is responsible for the degradation of BP in air. The characteristic XPS peaks at 134 eV from the PxOy species can be detected clearly (Fig. 2B). Kang et al. observed similar bubble formation processes in the mechanically exfoliated BP with a thickness over 150 nm for different times of exposure to air.86 We can see that the fresh BP has a smooth surface. After 1 day of exposure to the ambient environment, there are some bubbles formed on the BP surface. After being exposed for 7 days, much larger bubbles appeared instead of small and the surface turned more coarsened. Besides the bubble formation, the moisture condensation was also observed in the ambient environment.87 It was observed that the surface was crowded by water droplets with a size of 100 nm diameter and a height of 5 nm after 3 h of exposure and water completely covered the flake 122 h later, resulting in a huge convex meniscus (Fig. 2C). During the moisture condensation, the volume of absorbed water exhibits a rapid expansion at a speed of 7 μm3 min−1 within the first 15 h and keeps constant almost as larger droplets. Then, the volume continues to expand but at a slower rate of 2 μm3 min−1 at 60 h. Consequently, the volume has expanded more than 2 times because of moisture condensation from air. Using nanoscale time series imaging, Gamage et al. demonstrated that the area and volume of the bubbles formed on the surface of BP exhibited a slow increase at the very beginning of the chemical degradation process, and then the bubble expanded very fast until reaching saturation, showing an exponential increase (Fig. 2D).88 BP has three characteristic Raman models (A1g = 335 cm−1, A2g = 460 cm−1, and B2g = 434 cm−1).89 The PxOy species do not produce new Raman signals, but their formation can result in a significant decrease in intensities of these characteristic Raman peaks. Therefore, the Raman spectrum is a powerful tool to quantify the degradation of BP. Especially, the A1g/A2g ratio can act as an effective index for detecting degradation of BP.90

Regarding the chemical degradation of BP, it is essential to identify the roles of oxygen and water, determining its specific applications, such as photocatalysis. As seen in Fig. 3A, the degradation processes of BP nanosheets supported on SiO2/Si after being exposed to different environments were extensively studied by Huang et al. using optical microscopy.91 They observed that the BP flakes are inert in O2-free water, while degrade very fast in air or O2-enriched water, suggesting that oxygen is the primary factor for the degradation of BP, while water just has contribution to the degradation process only in the presence of oxygen. In the recent work, Zhou et al. reported a possible mechanism for the degradation of few-layer BP via theoretical calculations and simulations.92 They demonstrated that the degradation of BP is associated with its puckered honeycomb structure, in which a lone-electron pair in the phosphorus atom is exposed and can react with oxygen to form PxOy. Water does not involve in the reaction with BP directly, but it can remove the PxOy from the surface, leading to the inside phosphorus being re-exposed to sustain the oxidation (Fig. 3B). Besides oxygen and water, Favron et al. revealed that light acts as an important factor affecting the degradation of BP.84 They found that the degradation process is significantly prolonged without exposure under light illumination and the degradation rate is in proportion to light intensity (Fig. 3C). Moreover, light-assistant degradation is more serious for BP with thin thickness compared to the thicker ones. Zhou et al. also demonstrated the light-induced degradation of BP by DFT calculations. They found that with the increase in the size of the bandgap, BP can produce photo-generated electrons for the formation of O2− superoxide radicals under light illumination because of the suitable band positions of BP, matching well with the redox potential of O2/O2− (Fig. 3D).92–94 These O2− radicals are very reactive for the oxidation of BP.

2.2. Chemical bonding/van der Waals interactions
Although chemical degradation processes of BP are complicated and the reported mechanism may not be accurate, we can conclude that oxygen, water and light participate in the degradation of BP.84,92,95 Therefore, avoiding the contact of the surface with these three factors is expected to be a versatile method for preventing the degradation of BP. As a result, a fully-oxidized layer on the top of BP was proposed as a natural protective layer to inhibit further degradation of BP, leaving the underneath BP layers intact with high hole mobility.92,96 However, it is very difficult to control the formation of such a fully-oxidized BP layer via the traditional synthesis process. At this point, alternative strategies including encapsulation, chemical functionalization, liquid phase surface passivation, and doping have been developed to protect BP from degradation.97–99 Here, we will mainly discuss the stabilization of BP via the covalent bonding or van der Waals interactions to highlight the BP/carbon hybrid composites as a new kind of functional materials.
Ryder et al. systematically investigated the influence of the formation of P–C bonds on the stability of BP via modification with aryl diazonium molecules (Fig. 4A).75 The morphology of freshly exfoliated BP was inherited after functionalization for 30 min in a 10 mM solution of 4-nitrobenzene-diazonium (4-NBD), but with an increased thickness because of aryl diazonium. After 10 days of exposure to the ambient environment, the morphology of modified BP still kept unchanged and no discernible oxidation was detected. By contrast, the unmodified BP exhibited a riddled surface with many protrusions (Fig. 4B). The morphological stability of BP could be retained for as long as 25 days after the 4-NBD-functionalization, implying that the degradation of BP was prevented greatly. XPS and Raman results together with DFT calculations further demonstrated that the stability improvement of BP originates from the formation of P–C bonds via chemisorption of aryl groups on BP. More importantly, the FET devices using the modified BP showed improved electron mobility and switching ratio. Therefore, the chemical modification of BP via P–C bonding is a feasible strategy that can not only improve the stability of BP, but also keep the physical properties of BP unchanged. Generally, partial oxidization is difficult to avoid during the exfoliation of BP. But it also offers new opportunities for the modification of BP. Sofer et al. developed an alternative way for surface bonding of BP with alkyl halides to enhance BP stability (Fig. 4C).100 The reaction between BP and alkyl halides is based on the nucleophilic substitution, in which lone-electron pairs of P and O atoms in partially oxidized BP can attack the carbon central atom to form P–C and P–O–C bonds (Fig. 4D). Very recently, Zhu et al. reported the stabilization of BP by edge selective bonding with C60 molecules (Fig. 4E).79 Owing to the formation of P–C bonds demonstrated by XPS and K-edge XAS, the BP/C60 hybrid composite exhibited good stability against water and oxygen. Fig. 4F shows that the absorbance of the BP–C60 dispersion remains at ∼86% after 7 days, while BP only has 36%. The degradation rate of the BP/C60 hybrid composite is remarkably inhibited in water by a factor of 4.6 compared to that of BP. The formation of P–C bonds indeed not only improves the chemical stability, but also enhances the performance because of the synergistic effect between BP and carbon materials. For example, the BP/C60 hybrid composite employed as the catalyst for the photocatalytic degradation of RhB showed much higher activity, compared to BP and C60. These results demonstrated that chemical bonding with carbon materials is an effective route to improve the stability of BP toward a superior performance for applications.

Besides the formation of covalent bonds, van der Waals interactions were demonstrated to work for the stability improvement of BP in the hybrid composites as well. Doganov et al. prepared a BP/graphene hybrid composite via the dry transfer method, in which van der Waals interactions were dominant between BP and graphene instead of P–C bonds.101 The AFM scans of the BP/graphene hybrid composite did not exhibit any noticeable surface change after 24 h of exposure to the ambient environment, while it was obvious that the unprotected surface of the BP crystal became very coarse. The results demonstrated that the construction of BP/carbon hybrid composites via van der Waals interactions is an alternative strategy for the protection of BP against oxidization, which is especially promising for BP-based FET applications.
3. Synthesis of BP/carbon hybrid composites
In 2014, Sun et al. first demonstrated that a high energy ball milling process (HEBM) is an effective strategy for the preparation of the BP/carbon hybrid composite with P–C bonding from raw materials of red phosphorus and graphite under an Ar atmosphere at a pressure of 1.2 MPa.78 Ball-milling at a speed of 10 miles per hour provides high energy as the driving force for the conversion of BP from red phosphorus and the formation of P–C bonds between BP and graphite. Xu et al. prepared a BP/Ketjenblack–CNT hybrid composite.102 BP, Ketjenblack, and CNTs were mixed and ball-milled thoroughly under the protection of Ar to form the BP/Ketjenblack–CNT hybrid composite. During the ball milling process, nanosized BP particles were produced and hybridized with the highly conductive Ketjenblack network to construct a microsized secondary structure. CNTs were also added to produce a dual conductive network and stabilize the hybrid structure. The HEBM route was also employed to prepare the BP/C60 hybrid composite without the use of any additives.79 The exfoliation of BP occurred from bulk to few layers and some reactive species were generated at the edges of BP by mechanochemical cleavage of P–P bonds. Meanwhile, C60 was activated for the consequent conjugation to the edges of BP via P–C bonding. After ball-milling, Soxhlet-extraction was employed with CS2 as the solvent to remove unreacted C60. It was confirmed that the additive of LiOH has a negative role in the assembly of the BP/C60 hybrid composite. No any amorphous layer was observed in the BP/C60 hybrid composite when it was exposed to air, suggesting that the hybridization with C60 is conducive to enhance BP stability. EDS mapping revealed that the P elements are distributed uniformly over the entire nanosheet and have a much higher content than C elements, revealing that the C60 molecule was conjugated to the edges of BP rather than the surface.
The mechanical mixing strategy is also feasible for the assembly of BP/carbon hybrid composites with covalent bonding or van der Waals interactions. Pan et al. prepared a BP QDs/N-doped graphene hybrid composite via mixing BP QDs and N-doped graphene in THF under stirring for a couple of hours in an Ar atmosphere.103 It was found that N-doped graphene has very high surface energy, which can serve as the driving force to overcome the entropy penalty by the assembly process of heterostructures.104 Low-dimensional nanostructures tend to adhere spontaneously to the N-doped graphene via van der Waals interactions. Thereby, micelle-like heterostructures were formed to minimize the total free energy and make them stable in the solvent. Zheng et al. synthesized a BP/g-C3N4 heterostructure via a sonication-assistant liquid exfoliation route (Fig. 5A and B).105 In detail, bulk BP and g-C3N4 powder were mixed in the solvent of NMP first. After bubbling with Ar to remove air, the sonication processes were conducted to induce the exfoliation and assembly of BP and g-C3N4 in the solution. The SEM image and TEM images displayed that g-C3N4 was supported on the surface of BP flakes or wrapped on the BP edges. HRTEM showed the clear surface boundary in the BP/g-C3N4 hybrid composite. g-C3N4 as one component of the hybrid composite does not present any crystal lattice fringe, while it is clear in the BP. In the as-prepared BP/g-C3N4 heterostructure, strong interactions between BP and g-C3N4 exist, without any obvious evidence for the formation of P–C bonds, suggesting that the prepared BP/g-C3N4 heterostructure was assembled by van der Waals interactions. Interestingly, chemical bonding between BP and g-C3N4 was formed instead of van der Waals interactions when ultrathin g-C3N4 nanosheets were employed as a raw material.106 In addition, post calcination was demonstrated to promote the formation of P–C bonds in the BP/g-C3N4 hybrid composite (Fig. 5C–E).107 Similar BP/carbon hybrid composites with P–C bonding or van der Waals interactions have been reported via mechanical mixing under stirring or sonication.108–112

Solvothermal approaches can be employed for the synthesis of BP/carbon hybrid composites.113 Typically, powders of GO and BP were mixed uniformly in NMP under sonication. The dispersion was then poured into a stainless autoclave followed by adding NaOH. After reaction at 140 °C for 6 h, the product was collected via centrifugation. The reaction temperature was confirmed as the driving force for the formation of P–C and P–O–C bonds, which protect BP against the degradation. The higher the time is, the easier the formation of these bonds is. However, the structure of BP tends to be destroyed at higher temperature and the optimum reaction temperature was determined to be around 140 °C. To form more stable P–C bonds between RGO and BP, 4-nitrobenzenediazonium (4-NBD) was employed for the functionalization of BP nanosheets first under sonication.114 Owing to the functionalization with 4-NBD, BP flakes were conjugated to nitrobenzene through P–C bonds to form 4-NBD-modified BP nanosheets (4-BP), which leads to the thickness increase of BP nanosheets. On further using a solvothermal process, RGO is conjugated to the surface of BP to form the BP/graphene hybrid composite via P–C and P–O–C bonding connections. NaOH and KOH are the necessary chemical reagents added in the solvothermal reaction, which can protect BP against oxidation during the synthesis. Besides the above methods, other synthetic methods, such as pressurization and solvent evaporation, were used for the fabrication of the BP/graphene hybrid composite with P–C bonding or van der Waals interactions.115,116
4. Applications
4.1. Electrochemical energy storage

4.1.1. Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). 
LIBs possess exceptional characteristics of storage capacity, energy density and cycling stability and are therefore attractive for mobile electronic devices and electric vehicles.117–119 A classic LIB usually consists of a cathode, electrolyte, and anode, in which the cathode and anode acting as the hosts of Li+ ions are separated to refrain from the short circuit by a membrane, and the electrolyte provides the resource of Li+ ions.120 During charging, electricity is converted into electrochemical energy by the lithiation of Li+ ions at the anode companied by the formation of LixM (M = anode material). The delithiation process occurs because of the electrochemical potential difference between the cathode and anode during discharging. As a result, Li+ ions diffused back from the anode to the cathode. Therefore, the number of Li+ ions hosted per gram of electrode materials, namely, the specific capacity of electrode materials determines the performance of LIBs.
At present, oxides containing the lithium element are widely chosen as cathode materials in LIBs because of their excellent energy density, compact density and structural stability.121 Especially, the stoichiometric Li+ in compounds can keep the specific Li capacity almost unchanged. Accordingly, anode materials with high capacity are crucial for LIBs. Graphite is a promising anode material and has been commercialized for LIBs.122–124 However, recent LIBs composed of graphite as the anode and lithium compounds as cathodes delivered a low energy density of 200 W h kg−1 for practical applications because of a limited theoretical energy density of 400 W h kg−1, which falls short of the requirement for high-energy storage systems. Therefore, higher capacity alternatives are highly desirable for practical applications. Among the many potential candidates, lots of efforts focusing on the oxides of Sn and Si have been performed because of their excellent capability to combine reversibly with numerous Li ions per formula unit.123,125,126 Unfortunately, they exhibited a poor cycle efficiency because of the huge volume expansion during charging/discharging. Since 2004, the 2D materials of graphene, TMDs and MXenes have been studied intensively as potential candidates for LIB anodes.127–129 Most recently, 2D BP was proved to be promising for LIBs as the anode with an ultrahigh capacity of 2596 mA h g−1 in theory.130,131 As a pioneering study, Park et al. reported the first LIBs composed of bulk BP prepared by HEBM as the anode, which delivered a charge capacity of 1279 mA h g−1.130 This is the first literature, which demonstrated the feasibility of BP for the LIB anode even though it had a low first cycle efficiency of 57% due to poor electrical contact induced by huge volume changes (≈300%) during the lithiation process.
Recent theoretical studies also predicted that 2D few-layer BP is more suitable as an anode material for LIBs because of a low energy barrier of only 0.08 eV for an ultrahigh diffusivity of lithium ions and the unique 2D layer structure with broad interlayer spacing, benefiting the storage of more Li+ ions.131 Liquid-exfoliated BP was employed experimentally as a LIB anode by Zhang et al., delivering a reversible specific capacity of 210 mA h g−1 but with a poor CE of 11.5%.132 These experimental results confirmed although 2D BP exhibited high theoretical capacity as a LIB anode material, the poor cycle stability and CE originating from BP lattice stability and electronic conductivity are major challenges for further LIB applications.130 Hembram et al. theoretically revealed the atomistic lithiation process in BP by using DFT calculations, which was demonstrated to be similar to that of graphite for LIBs (Fig. 6A and B).133 During the lithiation process, LixPy is formed as the mesophase and finally converted into Li3P because of the lowest formation energy, in which P–P bond breaking is involved, resulting in the volume expansion. The observation of in situ TEM further revealed that the BP anode suffers from remarkable anisotropic size increase and conversion from BP to LixPy compounds.134 Moreover, the pulverization of the anode is serious during the discharge, leading to irreversibility of the lithiated products and therefore inferior LIB performance (Fig. 6C).

As an option to tackle structural instability in the processes of charge/discharge, the construction of heterostructures can effectively address these issues. BP/carbon hybrid composites exhibited high Li absorption energy and fast diffusion capability because of the interfacial synergistic effect between BP and carbon materials.135 Moreover, the hybrid structures presented extraordinary rigidity because of the stable connection by P–C or P–O–C bonds, which can effectively prevent the structural distortion of BP induced by the insertion of Li+ ions and provide improved stability to BP.136 Sun et al. demonstrated a reversible capacity of 1849 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles using a BP/graphite hybrid composite with P–C bonding connection as the anode material, which is much better than that of a BP/graphite mixture without bonding connection.78 The improved electrochemical performance originates from the prevented pulverization of BP during discharging by P–C bonding. Chen et al. reported flexible LIB electrodes using the hybrid composite of BP/graphene.137 The devices not only delivered a high specific capacity of 920 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1, but also retained a capacity of 80.2% and the average CE of around 100% even working at 500 mA g−1 over 500 cycles. Liu et al. reported a sandwiched BP/graphene thin-film anode via chemical bonding of P–C and P–O–C bonds.138 The anode used for LIBs presented a high reversible capacity of 1401 mA h g−1 within 200 cycles at a current density of 100 mA g−1 demonstrating excellent cycle stability. Very recently, Haghighat-Shishavan et al. fabricated a composite anode composed of BP, multiwall CNTs, and sodium carboxyl methyl cellulose–poly(acrylic acid) (NaCMC–PAA) binary polymeric binder, in which P–O–C bonds and dehydration cross-links were formed (Fig. 7A and B).139 The highest record on the charge/discharge capacities was obtained to be around 2007/2043 mA h g−1 at a current density of 0.2C (Fig. 7C). The initial discharge capacity of 87.5% (1681 mA h g−1) is still retained with an average CE of over 99.8% even after 400 cycles. More importantly, the anode exhibited superior high-rate capability at high current density as well. For example, the discharge capacities of up to 1513 mA h g−1 and 903 mA h g−1 can be realized after 100 cycles at 1C and after another 200 cycles at 4.5C, respectively. Such excellent LIBs characteristics are ascribed to well-preserved electrode structures by the strong bonding connections (Fig. 7D). Based on this above analysis, we believe that the BP/carbon hybrid materials are a promising type of anode materials for LIBs in the future.

4.1.2. Sodium-ion-batteries (SIBs). 
LIBs have already made up the total market share of rechargeable batteries because of their high energy and power capability but they suffer from low reserves of the Li element on earth. Both Na and Li elements belong to the I A group in the periodic table and possess homologous chemical properties, which implies that it is possible to fabricate a similar battery system using Na chemistry as well, like LIBs.140–144 More importantly, the reserves of the Na element are more abundant than those of the Li element on earth. The use of Na as an alternative to Li in the battery system, therefore, can solve the lack of Li reserves. The fundamental principles of SIBs can be analogous to those for LIBs, that is, the chemical potential difference of the Na+ ions between electrodes generates a voltage.143 During charging/discharging, the Na+ ions shuttle back and forth between the anode and cathode through a sodium-ion electrolyte. Specific capacity and operation voltage as the main indexes can reveal the performance of a battery, and are related to the electrochemical properties of the electrode materials. Recent studies on SIB cathode materials have achieved great success, realizing performances comparable to their LIB counterpart.144 However, it is not feasible to adapt LIB anode materials to SIBs because metallic sodium exhibits dendrite formation and a low melting point. Meanwhile, the Na+ ion is too large to pass through the channel of graphene layers (2.04 Å for Na+vs. 1.86 Å for graphene), making graphite electrochemically inactive for SIBs.145–147 Therefore, suitable anode materials are highly desirable and the major challenge in the study of SIBs.
Similar to the reaction with Li+ ions, phosphorus offers an ultrahigh theoretical specific capacity of 2596 mA h g−1, greatly exceeding those of any other materials used for SIB anodes and Na3P is electrochemically formed as the sodiation intermediate.148 Moreover, as one of the P allotropes, 2D BP closely resembles graphite in the aspects of structure and physical properties but it possesses a larger interlayer channel size for the storage of more Na+ ions, which indicates that BP is a potential anode material for SIBs.116 To achieve the optimum performance of BP-based SIBs, an in-depth understanding of the sodiation mechanism is crucial. It was found that BP will first transform into the mesophase NaxP and finally turn into amorphous Na3P during the sodiation process, accompanied by the disappearance of the bandgap, which is beneficial for promoting the electronic conductivity of BP (Fig. 8A).149 Based on the formation energies of NaxP, Na atoms preferred to be at the same layer with a coverage of 25% coverage per BP layer (Fig. 8B).150 Beyond this coverage, extra Na atoms tend to fill in the different BP layers until the formation of Na0.25P. Moreover, it was found that Na atoms diffused very fast and were anisotropic with an ultralow energy barrier of 0.04 eV (Fig. 8C), which is promising for the practical applications of SIBs at high charge/discharge rates. In situ TEM complemented by DTF calculations demonstrated that Na+ ions migrated along the [100] direction in BP (Fig. 8D).151

Single-layer BP was theoretically predicted to possess high specific capacity because of the excellent capability for the absorption of sodium ions to form NaP (865 mA h g−1) and Na2P (433 mA h g−1).149 Recently, BP with different layer numbers (2–11) was employed as an SIB anode material, which delivered a high capacity of 1968 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1.152 Although these features make BP attractive as an anode material for SIBs, BP also suffers from the same P–P bond breaking and huge volume increase during the sodiation, which harms the SIB performance.116 These disadvantages can be mitigated by the construction of BP/carbon hybrid composites via chemical bonding or van der Waals interactions, which can make BP stable and enhance conductivity.78
BP undergoes a larger volume increase in the sodiation process compared to that in the lithiation process because Na+ has a bigger size than Li+. To prohibit the volume expansion, Peng et al. took advantage of BP and carbon black to construct a BP/C hybrid composite via the HEBM route (Fig. 9).153 The particle sizes of both C and BP were reduced greatly via ball milling, which not only enables faster Na+ diffusion and better electrical conductivity, but also provides a better stress tolerance upon volume expansion during charging/discharging and diminishes the pulverization effect. Raman and XPS spectra obviously evidenced the existence of van der Waals interactions and P–C bonds between BP and carbon, which can guarantee electrical contact and preserve the structural integrity during cycling. These structural characteristics favor improved anode performance for SIBs. The BP/C hybrid composite anode delivered a reversible capacity of 1525 mA h g−1 with a CE of 62.4% in the 1st cycle of charging. The loss of capacity in the 1st cycle stems from irreversible decomposition of electrolyte and the formation of a solid electrolyte intermediate. Interestingly, the CE reached 97.2% in the 2nd cycle and kept stable approximately to 100% after that, suggesting that the formation of the solid electrolyte intermediate layer occurred mostly in the 1st cycle. Accordingly, a high capacity of 1381 mA h g−1 was retained after 100 cycles, which accounted for 90.5% of the initial capacity. Liu et al. also confirmed that the formation of P–C and P–O–C bonds via the hybridization of BP with graphene benefits the enhancement of the cycle performance of the BP anode because of the improved stability and conductivity.154 Typically, the hybrid anode exhibited specific capacities of 1472 mA h g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 in the 50th cycle and 650 mA h g−1 at 1 A g−1 after 200 cycles. By contrast, the anode exhibited remarkable reduction in the specific capacity (<100 mA h g−1) in the 10th cycle without the P–C bonds.

Besides P–C or P–O–C bonding, van der Waals heterostructures were reported to be effective in improving the BP/carbon hybrid anode performance for SIBs as well. Sun et al. fabricated sandwiched BP/graphene van der Waals heterostructures for SIBs, which offered a high reversible capacity of 2440 mA h g−1 at 0.05 A g−1 and an 83% capacity retention after 100 cycles.116 The enhanced performance originated from the inhibition of volume increase by elastic buffer spacing via the assembly of BP with graphene. Meanwhile, graphene acts as an electron transport pathway from BP to the current collector. Xu et al. assembled BP, Ketjenblack and multi-walled CNTs to form a hybrid nanostructure.155 It was confirmed that the introduction of MWCNTs can form a dual conductive network and improve the stability of the composite. Due to the special nanostructure, the hybrid composite serving as a SIB anode showed a high initial CE of up to 90% and specific capacity of 1700 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles at 1.3 A g−1.


4.1.3. Supercapacitors. 
Supercapacitors are advantageous over LIBs in charge/discharge rate, power capability, and cycle stability and therefore have attracted growing interest.156,157 Electric double-layer capacitors (EDLCs) and pseudocapacitors are main types of supercapacitors, which have different working principles. EDLCs store electrical energy through charge accumulation at the interface between the electrode and electrolyte while charge is stored in pseudocapacitors by reversible redox reactions between the electrode material and electrolyte.156 Pseudocapacitors often exhibit higher energy density than EDLCs, but they suffer from poor rate capability and cycle stability.158 Accordingly, EDLCs are more suitable for practical applications. In EDLCs, physical absorption is responsible for the charge distribution.159 Therefore, conductivity and the surface area of electrode materials determine the capacitance of EDLCs. The unique 2D layer structure of BP makes it attractive as an electrode material for EDLC application.160–163 Hao et al. reported a promising volumetric capacitance of 13.75 F cm−3 at a scanning rate of 10 mV s−1 using the BP electrode for flexible all-solid-state supercapacitors (ASSPs), outperforming the graphene supercapacitor in capacitance (∼1.0 F cm−3).160,164 Unfortunately, the restacking effect of BP nanoflakes strongly influences the performance of BP-based supercapacitors. How to prevent the restacking effect therefore is crucial for BP as an electrode material.
Graphene, CNTs and other carbon materials exhibit high conductivity to be promising electrode materials for EDLCs.165 Therefore, the hybridization of BP with these carbon materials is expected to offer a solution to improve the performance of BP-based EDLCs. To achieve the goal, Yang et al. fabricated a paper-like BP/CNT hybrid composite as a flexible electrode for ASSPs.166 Benefiting from the formed BP–CNT network, which can keep the structure of BP stable, the device delivered a volumetric capacitance as high as 41.1 F cm−3 and high power density of 821.62 W cm−3 at the BP and CNT ratio of 1:4. Moreover, it can still retain a large volumetric capacitance of 35.7 F cm−3 even after 11 months, which is better than the BP or graphene ASSP. Xiao et al. also reported flexible supercapacitors composed of a BP/graphene hybrid composite as the electrode, which delivered a promising areal capacitance of 9.8 mF cm−2 and high energy density of 11.6 mW h cm−3.167 The enhanced performance originates from the improved electrolyte shuttling and limited restacking effect by the hybridization with graphene. Very recently, Wu et al. reported the highest energy densities of 96.5 mW h cm−3 using a BP/CNT hybrid composite as a flexible electrode (Fig. 10).168 Unlike Yang's work, Wu et al. fabricated a BP/CNT heterostructure where CNTs were chemically bridged within BP via P–C bonding. The designed BP/CNT hybrid composite had an open layer structure, lamellar electron conduction and excellent structural stability, which provide promising ionic pathways and redox activity for ion flooding accommodation. Consequently, the supercapacitors exhibited a volumetric capacitance as high as 308.7 F cm−3, long cycle life and durability upon deformation.

The microstructure of the electrode material can significantly affect the performance. Therefore, future optimization of the microstructure of BP with special pore structure will make BP more attractive as an electrode material for supercapacitors. In addition, in previous studies, BP usually displayed typical EDLC behavior, while very recent results conducted by Nakhanivej et al. demonstrated that oxidized BP exhibits pseudocapacitor characteristics with a high capacitance of 478 F g−1 and excellent cycle stability of 91% over 50000 cycles, providing new opportunities to develop state-of-the-art BP-based electrodes for supercapacitors as well.169 In summary of this section, we provide a table (Table 1) to clearly present the above BP/carbon composites and their performance.

4.2. Water splitting

4.2.1. Electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction. 
In comparison with the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a rate-determining reaction for overall water splitting, which requires four electrons to be involved.170–174 A higher energy barrier (overpotential) therefore requires to be overcome in the OER for simulating the overall water splitting. The OER mechanisms were reported to be different under acidic and alkaline conditions (Fig. 11).175 Two different pathways were reported for the formation of oxygen from a MO (M = catalytic active sites) intermediate. One is through the decomposition of 2MO to form O2, and the other involves the formation of the MOOH intermediate, which subsequently decomposes to O2. In spite of the difference for oxygen production, it is a consensus that the OER is a heterogeneous catalytic reaction, in which the interfacial interactions play an important role in the electrocatalytic overall water splitting.
 Fig. 11  Proposed mechanisms for the OER in acid (blue line) and alkaline (red line) aqueous solutions. There are two pathways for the production of oxygen. One is the formation of M–OOH from the M–O intermediate (black arrows). The other is through the direct decomposition of 2MO (green arrows). Adapted with permission from ref. 176. Copyright 2017, Royal Society of Chemistry. 
Compounds containing noble metals are used for OERs as the most efficient electrocatalysts but they have a high cost.176–178 Hence, it is highly desirable to develop noble metal-free electrocatalysts. Jiang et al. reported electrocatalytic oxygen production using BP as the catalyst for the first time (Fig. 12).179 The measurements of linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) and Tafel plots deduced an onset potential of 1.48 V and 91.52 mV dec−1 in 0.1 m KOH solution, respectively, which suggested that the electrocatalytic performance of BP is comparable with that of the commercial RuO2 for the OER.180 Nanostructures usually exhibit a more exceptional electrochemical OER than their bulk counterparts because of the existence of intrinsic defects.45 Thus, higher OER activity is expected by exfoliating the bulk into few layers because of the increased surface area, more active sites and defects. The hypothesis was confirmed recently by Ren et al. as well.181 They employed BP nanosheets with different thicknesses as an OER catalyst and found that the OER activity was obviously improved as the thickness reduced.179,182

Unfortunately, BP suffers more rapid degradation as the thickness decreases.75,83 which is contradictory to the improved OER performance by the decrease of thickness. To overcome the problem, the construction of BP-based composites is a promising strategy. For example, the BP/CNTs hybrid composite only required 1.6 V to produce a current density of 10.0 mA cm−2, which is close to 1.57 V for the commercial IrO2 and 1.59 V for the commercial RuO2.179 Meanwhile, the current density just reduced by 3.4% after a continuous reaction for 10000 s, which suggests improved stability with respect to BP–Ti (9.48%). The 3D BP–CNT network structure results in more efficient catalytic kinetics and structural rigidity for the improved OER performance. The BP/CNT hybrid composite confirms a great potential instead of noble metal-based OER catalysts. However, the current studies of OERs employing BP/carbon hybrid composites as electrocatalysts are still very limited. Further studies are still highly expected, focusing on the microstructure and interface interaction for exploring the optimum OER performance.


4.2.2. Electrocatalytic overall water splitting. 
Electrocatalytic overall water splitting has received intense interest for the production of H2 because of high energy conversion efficiency and negligible environmental pollution.183–189 A typical electrolysis device is composed of an aqueous electrolyte, anode, and cathode (Fig. 13).190 For overall water splitting, two-half reactions require to be driven simultaneously at an external voltage, where the oxygen is produced at the anode accompanied by the production of protons and electrons while hydrogen is obtained at the cathode by the reduction of the protons. Therefore, electrocatalysts offering bifunctionality for the HER and OER and the electrolyte are crucial for efficient electrocatalytic overall water splitting.191,192 Unfortunately, most of the existing catalysts do not work for both reactions well.190 At present, Pt-based catalysts have been commercialized for the HER, while an efficient OER is usually realized by using Ir/Ru compounds as catalysts.193–195 However, the use of these catalysts is limited because of high cost. It is still very challenging to explore noble metal-free electrocatalysts with excellent bifunctionality for overall water splitting.

Although BP as an emerging 2D material has been confirmed to be effective for HER and OER separately, no literature reported its bifunctionality for overall electrocatalytic water splitting.179,196,197 Very recently, there was groundbreaking research on hybridization of BP with graphene as a catalyst, realizing effective electrocatalytic overall water splitting.198 Yuan et al. constructed a BP/N-doped graphene 2D/2D heterostructure by the electrostatic interaction between these two components (Fig. 14). ICP-AES and XPS analysis revealed that the degradation concentrations of P in BP/N-doped graphene were much lower than that in bare BP after 2 weeks of exposure to the ambient environment, which indicated that the degradation of BP is prevented remarkably via the hybridization of graphene with respect to bare BP, addressing the critical issue of instability for broadening its practical application in water splitting. By optimizing the component ratio in the heterostructure, the BP/N-doped graphene (1:4) hybrid composite exhibited the highest HER activity with an overpotential of 0.191 V to provide a current density of 10 mA cm−2, which is much lower than that in each component (0.37 V for BP and 0.445 V for N-doped graphene) under the same conditions. A stable catalytic current with a loss of below 10% was obtained in the hybrid composite after reaction for 16 h. By contrast, unmodified BP exhibited a loss of 45% after only 5 h while the benchmark Pt/C had a loss as high as 25% over 16 h. Besides the superior HER performance, the hybrid composite yielded an ultralow OER potential of 0.31 mV at 10 mA cm−2, superior to each component in the hybrid composite and even comparable with the commercial RuO2 catalyst. Similar to the HER, the hybrid composite also maintained an excellent catalytic current stability with a slight loss below 4% after 12 h of OER at 10 mA cm−2, which is much better than that of BP and commercial RuO2. The electrocatalysis cell fabricated by using the BP/N-doped hybrid composite for electrodes in KOH delivered a faradaic efficiency (FE) of >97% and the gases of H2 and O2 with a molar ratio of around 2:1. Such exceptional electrocatalytic performance is ascribed to the synergistic effect of BP and graphene, which not only prevents the degradation of BP greatly, but also effectively regulates the electronic structures of each composition to boost electrocatalytic activities.

4.2.3. Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. 
Compared to the electrocatalytic and photoelectrocatalytic water splitting, photocatalytic hydrogen production using powder semiconductors as photocatalysts from water is the most ecofriendly strategy for the clean energy conversion and storage due to simple operation and the low cost.199–202 The overall water splitting reaction is thermodynamically unfavorable, in which an energy barrier of 237 kJ mol−1 needs to be overcome.199,203 External energy, such as sunlight, is required to input for driving water splitting. Under the illumination, electron–holes pairs are generated inside semiconducting photocatalysts by the excitation of the bandgap (Fig. 15A).200 Photogenerated carriers are separated and then transferred to surface active sites for the subsequent surface redox reactions. With regard to Gibbs free energy values, the bandgap of photocatalysts should be >1.23 eV at least for overall water splitting.204 Meanwhile, the bottom of the CB is required to be higher than the H+/H2 reduction potential (0.0 eV vs. NHE at pH 0), and the top of the VB is lower than the redox potential of O2/H2O (+1.23 eV vs. NHE at pH 0) (Fig. 15B). Therefore, the bandgap and carrier separation efficiency are two important factors determining the efficiency of photocatalytic hydrogen production.205,206 To increase the energy conversion efficiency, generally, the band gap of the photocatalysts should be as narrow as possible, so as to harvest more visible light from the solar spectrum, while the combination of electron–hole pairs should be prohibited, so as to increase the lifetime of photogenerated electrons for the reduction of water. Therefore, the improvement on light harvesting and carrier separation is highly desirable in the field of photocatalytic water splitting.

Besides the high free-carrier mobility and large specific surface area, BP has been proved to present a tunable bandgap with the increase of layer thickness, which covers the whole sunlight spectrum.43,207 These unique properties make BP attractive as a photocatalyst for hydrogen production.207–211 Based on the DFT calculation, Sa et al. deduced that the VB of BP lies at less positive oxidation potential of water under ambient conditions for the first time.212 However, its CBM lies above the H+/H2 reduction potential, which suggests that BP is only used for extracting hydrogen from water. However, they demonstrated that the VB and CB positions of BP are suitable for overall water splitting at pH of 8 because the redox potential of water decreases as pH increases (Fig. 15C).205 This result demonstrated theoretically that BP is a potential photocatalyst for overall water splitting. Zhu et al. observed experimentally photocatalytic hydrogen production using hydroxyl-functionalized BP as a catalyst.208 An apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of 0.47% was obtained, which is better than that reported for the well-known g-C3N4 photocatalyst (Fig. 15D). Rahman et al. employed exfoliated BP as a catalyst for photocatalytic hydrogen production. An AQE as high as 3.9% at 420 nm was realized in the absence of a cocatalyst.213 Despite some published studies demonstrating conclusively the possibility of photocatalytic hydrogen production using BP as a catalyst in the laboratory-scale, they suffered from unsatisfactory photocatalytic performance by the poor charge separation and chemical stability during the reaction.208,210 To solve the above issues, the hybridization of BP with carbon materials is an attractive option.80,111,214
Zhu et al. employed BP, GO, and Pt as component units to construct a BP/Pt/RGO hybrid catalyst for photocatalytic hydrogen generation, where BP acts as the light absorber for the harvesting of solar light, RGO is employed as an electron mediator and Pt is a cocatalyst.215 It was found that the amount of H2 production increased with the increase of BP concentration in the hybrid catalyst, but it is not linear because the opaque dispersion at high concentration blocks the use of incident light.216,217 As a result, the optimum AQEs of around 8.7% for 420 nm and 1.5% for 780 nm were realized in the BP/Pt/RGO hybrid catalyst, which are much higher than that of BP because of efficient separation and transfer of photogenerated carriers. More importantly, the photocatalytic stability of BP was improved greatly as well after the hybridization with Pt and GO. Similar to the BP/Pt/RGO ternary composite, Zhu et al. recently synthesized MoS2-decorated BP/GO for solar-driven hydrogen production, in which GO plays dual functions including keeping BP stable in NMP and acting as an electron mediator.80 Because of the cooperative effect of GO and MoS2 for efficient electron separation and transfer, the BP/GO/MoS2 hybrid composite can produce 10.4 μmol H2 with an excellent stability after visible light illumination for 3 h. Lei et al. developed a 0D/2D hybrid composite by using BP quantum dots and g-C3N4 as precursors for photocatalytic water splitting, in which BP quantum dots have a bandgap of 1.59 eV, while the bandgap of g-C3N4 is 2.7 eV.218 It was confirmed that BP quantum dots and g-C3N4 were assembled via P–C bonding connection to form the BP quantum dots/g-C3N4 heterostructure with type-II band alignment (Fig. 16A and B). Upon illumination with visible light, the photoexcited electrons in the CB of BP quantum dots are transferred to the CB of g-C3N4, while the photogenerated holes in the VB of g-C3N4 flowed to the CB of BP quantum dots, thus realizing spatial carrier separation. As a result, the photocatalytic hydrogen production was enhanced (Fig. 16C). It was also proposed that the formation of P–C bonds is relevant to the coordinatively unsaturated atoms BP at the edge, which protects the BP quantum dots against the degradation. That's why the BP quantum dots/g-C3N4 heterostructure exhibits no significant photoactivity reduction after 8 cycles up to 32 h (Fig. 16D), while pristine BP quantum dots presented a negligible amount of H2 production after 1.5 h. Ultrafast transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy was employed to reveal the dynamics of electron transfer (Fig. 16E). It makes sense that the electron concentrations in both g-C3N4 and BP quantum dots/g-C3N4 decrease with the increase of delayed time because of the carrier recombination of electron–hole pairs under excitation with 400 nm light. However, the BP quantum dots/g-C3N4 heterostructure presented higher signal intensity, indicating that the amount of photogenerated electrons is more in the heterostructure. As a result, the BP quantum dots/g-C3N4 heterostructure displayed an average lifetime of 2275.2 ps at 695 nm, which is much longer than that for g-C3N4 (1685.5 ps). So, the prolonged lifetime demonstrated that the formation of P–C bonds between BP quantum dots and g-C3N4 can improve the interfacial carrier separation. Ran et al. reported a BP/g-C3N4 heterostructure, in which the van der Waals interaction instead of P–C bonds acts as the driving force of the assembly.109 The van der Waals heterojunction exhibited enhanced photocatalytic H2 evolution and stability compared to BP. Besides P–C bonds and van der Waals interactions, the P–N bond was confirmed as another possible chemical bonding in the BP/g-C3N4 heterostructure.106 As the BP/g-C3N4 hybrid composite was illuminated with NIR light, P–N bonds can capture the photoexcited electrons from BP as a trapper for enhancing the NIR photocatalytic activity. The performance of black phosphorus/carbon hybrid composites toward photocatalytic hydrogen production is also summarized in Table 2.

Apart from photocatalytic hydrogen evolution, BP/carbon hybrid composites also offer possible opportunities for other photocatalytic applications, such as organic pollutant degradation.79,219

4.3. Electronic/optoelectronic devices

4.3.1. FETs. 
Generally, the flow of electricity is generated in semiconductors when some kind of excitation, such as heat and light, can bridge the VB and CB. As the semiconductor can be excited by an external electric field to switch on and off, it is called a FET.220–222 A FET is composed of three terminals of source, gate and drain in the channel (Fig. 17A).223 The operation of a conventional FET depends on the control of the channel conductivity, and thus the drain current, by a voltage (VGS) applied between the gate and the source (Fig. 17B). Mobility and on/off current ratio are the two crucial indexes, reflecting the performance of FETs. Despite the extremely high mobility in graphene, graphene FETs exhibit a low on/off current ratio due to its absence of the band gap,224–226 while the mobility of TMD FETs is too low to realize any practical application even though they have a finite bandgap.227,228

A conducting channel is produced, accompanied by the flow of drain current of ID as the voltage supplied to the source and gate electrodes is larger than the threshold voltage of VTh. (B) FET physics. Plots of IDversus the gate–source voltage of VGS reveal the transfer characteristics of FETs. It is switched on at the maximum VGS applied to the device. The larger the slope in the subthreshold region is, the better the switch-on characteristics of the device will be. Beyond the threshold, the change of ID for a difference of VGS is defined as the terminal transconductance of gmt. Adapted with permission from ref. 223. Copyright 2010, Nature Publishing Group. 
As an emerging 2D material, BP offers a high charge mobility and thickness-dependent bandgap makes it interesting for FETs instead of graphene and TMDs. In the pioneering work, Li et al. fabricated the first BP FETs, in which the thickness of BP is down to a few nanometers. They demonstrated a promising ambipolar FET performance with a drain current modulation on the order of 105 and a field-effect mobility of 1000 cm2 V−1 s−1, which are better than those of graphene-based FETs and commercial Si-based FETs.33 Similar BP-based FETs have been reported by other groups as well.229–234 Wang et al. recently reported the great potential of BP for high frequency electronics due to the excellent current saturation properties.235 The fabricated standard ground–signal–ground (GSG) pads exhibited a promising short-circuit current-gain cutoff frequency (fT) of 12 GHz and the maximum oscillation frequency (fmax) of 20 GHz. The majority of the reported BP FETs is a p type or ambipolar manner. Recently, Perello et al. realized unipolar n-type FETs using 3 nm BP nanoflakes contacted by aluminum.236 The devices exhibited an ultrahigh on/off current ratio of 105 and charge mobility of 275 cm2 V−1 s−1 at 300 K, while they increased to 107 and 630 cm2 V−1 s−1 at 80 K.
As for the source and drain electrodes, ultralow contact resistances and linear responses are crucial for practical applications.219 Obviously, BP FETs have already presented a high on/off current ratio, low subthreshold swing and excellent current saturation.37,237–243 However, the performance of BP FETs lowers remarkably after being exposed to the ambient environment shortly.75,244–246 Specifically, the threshold voltage of BP FETs increased greatly after 6 h of exposure to the ambient environment. The on/off current ratio and mobility decrease by a factor of 1000 after 56 h (Fig. 18).85 Optical imaging clearly demonstrated the appearance of degradation bubbles, which is dependent on the exposure time, like the degradation of BP flakes. The degradation of performance is mainly associated with the chemical instability of BP.

Avsar et al. developed a solution to the stability problem of BP FETs by constructing a 2D heterostructure using BP, graphene and h-BN, in which van der Waals interactions are dominant at all interfaces (Fig. 19A).247 The modified device had nearly hysteresis-free transport characteristics as expected under both the vacuum and ambient environment. By contrast, the unmodified device showed an obvious hysteresis (∼30 V) even though it was operated in a vacuum environment and a huge reduction of 80% in the conductivity when operated in air (Fig. 19B). Generally, a positive hysteresis can be observed in the transport process if the 2D material in the channel is sensitive to the external chemical environment.223 Therefore, these observations clearly revealed that the hybridization with monolayer graphene and h-BN via van der Waals interactions is effective in preventing the oxidization of BP. Besides improved stability, lowered contact resistance was observed in the heterostructure, offering more efficient hole injection to the VB of BP at high electric fields (Fig. 19C). Accordingly, the Schottky barrier was eliminated, which makes the device more stable at low temperature.248–250 The modified FETs only exhibited 30% reduction of charge mobility from room temperature down to 10 K, while the device without graphene hybridization showed a decrease in mobility of more than 80% when temperature reduced from room temperature to 20 K. Some other novel device characteristics were also explored in FETs based on the BP/graphene heterostructure.101,251,252 Most of the BP FETs show an in-plane transport dominating device characteristic. Kang et al. demonstrated out-of-plane electronic transport properties in the vertical FET geometry composed of a BP/graphene heterostructure, which also delivered a promising on-state current density of 1600 A cm2 and on/off ratio over 800 at low temperature.253 Li et al. reported a floating-gate manipulated nonvolatile ambipolar Schottky junction in the BP/graphene heterostructure.254 By the adjustment of the voltage pulse applied to the control gate, the FETs exhibited ambipolar characteristics and could serve as graphene-p-BP or graphene-n-BP junctions with reverse rectification behavior. Moreover, the junction delivered excellent storability and could be still programmable over 10 years, making it attractive for dual-mode nonvolatile Schottky junction memories, memory inverter circuits, and logic rectifiers.

4.3.2. Photodetectors. 
Photodetectors that can convert light into electrical signals have great potential for photodetection, imaging, and telecommunications.255–258 Due to the excellent optoelectrical and structural properties, many efforts were devoted to the fabrication of graphene/TMD-based photodetectors.259–263 However, this kind of photodetector suffers from some disadvantages. For example, graphene-based photodetectors usually exhibit a pretty week photoresponsivity due to the absence of the bandgap for the limited generation of photocarriers, while the carrier mobility is low in TMDs even with a moderate bandgap.264,265 It is highly desirable to develop novel functional materials with high photoresponsivity in a broadband spectral range. Benefiting from the exceptional semiconducting properties which fulfill the above criteria, BP has been proved to be promising for photodetectors.266–270
Youngblood et al. reported near-infrared-telecom-band-responsive gated BP photodetectors by integration with a silicon photonic waveguide.271 The photodetectors exhibited an extremely low dark current of below 220 nA and high photoresponsivities of 135 mA W−1 and 657 mA W−1 at room temperature for the devices with the thickness of 11.5 nm and 100 nm, respectively. Moreover, the photocurrent was governed by the photovoltaic effect with an ultrahigh response bandwidth over 3 GHz. Huang et al. reported a high-performance BP photodetector responding to the wavelength region of 400–900 nm.272 The photoresponsivities were reported to be as high as 7 × 106 A W−1 at 20 K and 4.3 × 106 A W−1 at 300 K, respectively, which are the champion results reported by far. To realize a higher performance of BP-based photodetector in the IR region, Liu et al. constructed a vertical heterostructure composed of graphene and BP for photodetectors (Fig. 20A).273 The SEM image clearly revealed that the BP nanosheets were coated completely by the monolayer graphene sheets so as to protect BP against oxidation. Upon illumination with 1550 nm light, the device exhibited a 60-fold and 8-fold enhancement of photocurrent compared to the graphene and BP devices, respectively. Efficient separation and injection of photogenerated carriers from BP to graphene are responsible for the improved performance, significantly reducing the Schottky barrier at the interface.250 Accordingly, the device delivered an ultrahigh responsivity of 1.3 × 103 A W−1 operated upon illumination with 1550 nm at a low power of 11 nW, which is higher by more than 5 and 3 orders of magnitude compared to the single-layer graphene and BP devices, respectively (Fig. 20B). By the control of the thickness of BP, the performance of photodetectors was further improved, showing a photoresponsivity of 3.3 × 103 A W−1, a photoconductive gain of 1.13 × 109 and a rise time of about 4 ms, which is 3046-fold higher than that delivered by the state-of-the-art InGaAs detector operating at the same wavelength. More importantly, only 6% of the photoresponsivity of the BP/graphene devices degraded even after 2 months (Fig. 20C), stemming from the improved chemical stability by the hybridization of BP with graphene. Meanwhile, the heterostructure photodetector showed a high photoconductive gain of 1.13 × 109, fast electron transfer of 41 fs and polarization-dependent photocurrent response. Such high performance in the BP/graphene hybrid composite with van der Waals interactions made them promising for ultrafast IR optoelectronics.

5. Conclusion and perspective
In summary, the physical properties of a tunable bandgap, high carrier mobility, and unique anisotropy originating from the 2D honeycomb structure make BP promising for application in electrochemical energy storage and conversion, water splitting, electronic/optoelectronic devices, and biomedicine. However, unlike graphene and TMDs, BP undergoes serious chemical degradation, leading to the loss of its semiconducting properties, which are the fundamental for its applications. As alternatives, BP/carbon hybrid composites composed of BP and carbon materials are studied widely as novel functional materials that not only inherit the characteristics from BP and carbon materials, but also exhibit some new properties and better stability due to the interaction between BP and carbon materials. In this review, we have summarized the recent study advances in BP/carbon hybrid composites. Some feasible methods for the construction of BP/carbon hybrid composites are introduced briefly. We can see that significant achievements have been made in the stability of BP via hybridization with carbon materials, together with breakthroughs in applications including in electrochemical energy storage, water splitting and electronic/optoelectronic devices. Nevertheless, studies on BP/carbon hybrid composites are apparently at the initial stage, which provides us challenges and comes with opportunities.
In spite of the successful assemblies of BP with various carbon materials via van der Waals or chemical bonding interactions that have been realized, facile and scalable synthesis techniques for constructing heterostructures are still at the early stage. In previous results, synthetic approaches toward the assembly of BP/carbon heterostructures are mainly dependent on two-step top-down methods, but they show some drawbacks. BP is difficult to be distributed homogeneously in carbon frameworks. Meanwhile, the contact between BP and carbon materials is not intimate enough, accompanied by the uneven particle size, which are not beneficial for applications. Alternatively, the construction of BP/carbon heterostructures using bottom-up methods such as hydrothermal/solvothermal synthesis is highly expected. Very recently, we developed a bottom-up method for the preparation of partially oxidized BP through a facile solvothermal process, which is a major first step forward.210,211 Ongoing efforts are still required to achieve a controlled assembly of BP/carbon heterostructures.
For electrochemical energy storage, BP/carbon hybrid materials were mainly used as anode materials, realizing improved electrochemical performance because the incorporation of carbon materials not only dramatically enhanced the electrical conductivity of electrodes, but also restrained the huge volume expansion of BP during cycling. In spite of this, the use of some appropriate oxides with excellent structural stability and organic polymers with high conductivity is a possible option as additives in the BP/carbon heterostructures applied to batteries based on the consideration of safety and accessibility. In addition, the comprehensive understanding of structural properties of BP/carbon heterostructures especially at the interface, reaction dynamics and electrochemical reaction mechanisms should be strengthened in the following research to further optimize the electrochemical performance.
Referring to water splitting, the catalytic activity is dominantly determined by carrier separation and transfer efficiencies, while the light harvesting capability is also important for solar-driven catalytic water splitting. Since the tunable bandgap of BP (0.3–2.0 eV) enables the harvesting of light from the visible to NIR region, it is expected as a potential candidate for photocatalytic hydrogen production. To solve the carrier separation and transfer in BP, most of the studies focused on the construction of BP/g-C3N4 heterostructures. Little attention was paid to other carbon materials including graphene, CNTs and C60, which are good electron mediators. The assembly of BP with these carbon materials offers a feasible pathway to restrain the disadvantageous charge recombination, while the interfacial interaction between BP and carbon materials needs to be further revealed. Meanwhile, the structural evolution is crucial to produce more active sites by the exposure of a larger surface area. Therefore, to substantially improve the catalytic activity, the controllable design of BP/carbon heterostructures with a desirable structure may be a good future direction.
Besides the applications summarized above, BP also shows great potential in laser, biomedicine and sensors.49–51,274–282 However, there are few reports on BP/carbon hybrid composites for these fields to date.283,284 Future study and breakthroughs still require collaboration of scientists from multidiscipline, such as chemistry, physics, materials science, and biology. We believe that BP would walk to real-world applications in the future with multifaceted and persistent efforts, like graphene.

 	Fig. 17  (A) Schematics of the structure of the n-channel Si MOSFET. A conducting channel is produced, accompanied by the flow of drain current of ID as the voltage supplied to the source and gate electrodes is larger than the threshold voltage of VTh. (B) FET physics. Plots of IDversus the gate–source voltage of VGS reveal the transfer characteristics of FETs. It is switched on at the maximum VGS applied to the device. The larger the slope in the subthreshold region is, the better the switch-on characteristics of the device will be. Beyond the threshold, the change of ID for a difference of VGS is defined as the terminal transconductance of gmt. Adapted with permission from ref. 223. Copyright 2010, Nature Publishing Group.
