    , Accepted 21st January 2020First published on 24th January 2020AbstractPhotocatalysis on semiconductors using solar energy sources provides a clean technology to produce hydrogen from water splitting. Although zirconia (ZrO2) is a semiconductor oxide, it is not generally considered as a photocatalyst owing to its poor light absorbance and wide bandgap (over 5 eV). In this study, black ZrO2 with a large concentration of lattice defects such as oxygen vacancies, dislocations and nanograin boundaries is stabilized by high-pressure torsion (HPT) straining. The black ZrO2, which experiences monoclinic–tetragonal phase transformations during the HPT process, shows large light absorption, a small bandgap, reduced conduction band energy and high photocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution due the presence of oxygen vacancies. These results confirm that the introduction of strain-induced oxygen vacancies is a potential method to produce low-bandgap photocatalysts.
Introduction
Hydrogen is considered as a clean energy carrier for future applications, but the production of hydrogen without emitting CO2 is still challenging.1 Production of hydrogen from renewable energy sources such as solar energy is currently the main task in the hydrogen energy studies.2 Photocatalytic water splitting is considered as an ideal method to produce hydrogen, but the efficiency of the method is still very low.3 Since the introduction of titania (TiO2) for photocatalysis in 1972,4 different semiconductors have been used for photocatalytic water splitting, but TiO2 is still one of the best photocatalysts.5–7 Zirconia (ZrO2) is located in the same group as TiO2 in the periodic table, but ZrO2 is not generally considered as a photocatalyst owing to its wide bandgap of over 5 eV.8,9 Although there are many applications for the ZrO2-based materials in coating, sensors, catalysis, energy conversion and biomedical applications,10–15 there are high interests to reduce the bandgap of ZrO2 and use it in photocatalytic applications.16–21
Recently, introduction of oxygen vacancies has been introduced as a potential method to produce low-bandgap photocatalysts.22–27 For example, black TiO2−x, which is synthesized by chemical creation of oxygen vacancies and Ti3+ ions on the surface of anatase nanopowders, exhibits an extended absorption in both visible and ultraviolet (UV) light regions with a high photocatalytic activity.28–30 The introduction of oxygen vacancy was also used for production of other black oxides with improved optical properties.31–37 For example, in a study using both theoretical and experimental investigations, it was shown that the oxygen vacancies can turn insulator Al2O3, which is not a photocatalyst, to a low-bandgap photocatalyst for dye degradation.37
The high-pressure torsion (HPT) method,38–40 as schematically shown in Fig. 1a, is an effective technique for stabilizing large concentration of vacancies in different kinds of metals,41–43 oxides44–46 and oxynitrides.47 In this method, high pressure and large plastic strain are simultaneously applied to a sample between two rotating anvils.48 The large plastic strain and resultant formation of lattice defects (vacancies, dislocations, and nanograin boundaries) in the HPT method change the mechanical and physical properties of materials significantly.38–48

In this study, we report the first application of the HPT method to produce black ZrO2 with high concentration of strain-induced oxygen vacancies, high light absorbance, low bandgap and good activity for photocatalytic hydrogen production.
Experimental
Although ZrO2 has several phases such as monoclinic, tetragonal, cubic and orthorhombic (see the phase diagram of ZrO2 in Fig. 1b),49 ZrO2 doped with 3 mol% Y2O3, having 42 wt% monoclinic phase and 58% tetragonal phase, was selected for this study because of two reasons. First, an earlier study showed that a tetragonal-to-monoclinic phase transformation occurs in this material during HPT processing.50 Second, earlier studies showed that the phase transformations during the HPT process are quite effective to introduce large concentration of oxygen vacancies in different oxides such as BaTiO3,44 TiO2,45 ZnO,46 TiO2–ZnO,51 Al2O3 (ref. 37) and tantalate perovskites.52 The ZrO2 – 3 mol% Y2O3 material was in the form of powder with a nominal grain size of ∼50 nm and processed by HPT under 6 GPa for 2 turns at room temperature (300 K), 373 K, 473 K, 573 K and 673 K with a rotation speed of 1 rpm. The HPT-processed samples, which had a disc shape with 10 mm diameter and ∼0.8 mm thickness, were examined in highly-strained regions located at 2–5 mm away from the disc center by various techniques (see appearance of sample pieces in Fig. 1c).
First, phase transformation was analysed by Raman spectroscopy using 325 nm ultraviolet (UV) laser, and X-ray diffraction (XRD) using Cu Kα radiation.
Second, microstructure of samples was examined by Cs-corrected high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) using an acceleration voltage of 200 kV.
Third, oxygen vacancies were characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) using Al Kα radiation, photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy using 325 nm UV laser, and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) at 298 K using a microwave frequency of 9468.8 MHz.
Fourth, the bandgap and electronic structure of samples were examined by UV-visible light diffuse reflectance (UV-vis) spectroscopy, ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) using a He discharge UV lamp and 5 V bias, and XPS valence band measurements using Al Kα radiation.
Fifth, photocatalytic activity was examined by measuring the hydrogen production rate from water splitting using a 300 W Xe lamp within 180 min under full spectrum as well under visible light region with a 400 nm long-pass filter. For the photocatalytic test, 50 mg of ZrO2 samples were crushed and dispersed in 27 cm3 of H2O, 3 cm3 of CH3OH as scavenger and 0.0513 cm3 of 0.01 M Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2 as cocatalyst. The amount of H2 gas was measured using a gas chromatograph with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). The active surface area of samples for photocatalysis was measured by nitrogen gas adsorption test via the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method.53 The surface area was 20.0 m2 g−1 for the powders and 5.8 m2 g−1, 7.7 m2 g−1 and 5.6 m2 g−1 for the sample processed by HPT at 300 K, 473 K and 673 K, respectively.
Results
To study the phase transformations after HPT processing, Raman spectroscopy and XRD were conducted on all samples, as shown in Fig. 2a and b, respectively. The Raman peak heights corresponding to the tetragonal phase become less intense after HPT processing in Fig. 2a, indicating the occurrence of a tetragonal-to-monoclinic phase transformation, which has a stress-induced transformation nature.54 The XRD analysis, shown in Fig. 2b, also confirms a stress-induced phase transformation from the monoclinic phase to the tetragonal phase. Detailed analysis of XRD patterns using the Rietveld method, as shown in Fig. 2c, reveals that the fraction of monoclinic phase is 42 wt% for the initial powder, but it increases after HPT processing. The fraction of monoclinic phase increases by increasing the HPT processing temperature, but after reaching a maximum of 76 wt% at 473 K, decreases with further increase in the temperature.

Since XRD peak broadening after HPT processing in Fig. 2b suggests the occurrence of lattice strain through the grain fragmentation and dislocation generation,55 microstructural features were examined in detail using TEM. The grain refinement after HPT processing can be seen in the bright-field images, dark-field images and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns of Fig. 3. While the initial powder has an average grain size of 47 ± 25 nm, the average grain size decreases to 26 ± 20 nm, 33 ± 17 nm and 27 ± 20 nm after HPT processing at 300 K, 473 K and 673 K, respectively. The formation of smaller nanograins after HPT processing is shown more clearly in the high-resolution TEM images of Fig. 4. In Fig. 4a, a tetragonal grain is observed in the initial powder, but several grains and several monoclinic/tetragonal interphase boundaries are observed in Fig. 4b–d after HPT processing at 300 K, 373 K and 673 K, respectively. Note that all lattice images were analysed by fast Fourier transform (FFT). Close examination of the lattice images in Fig. 4 reveals that several edge dislocations are present within nanograins after HPT processing (e.g., see yellow dashed line). Furthermore, in addition to individual dislocations within nanograins, the pile up of dislocations and formation of low-angle subgrain boundaries is observed after HPT processing, as shown in Fig. 5. There is one monoclinic grain in Fig. 5 which is divided by some subgrain boundaries with the misorientation angles of 8°, 6°, 4° and 6° from the top to the bottom of image. Such grain refinement and formation of dislocations and subgrain boundaries, which are in line with the peak broadening observed in the XRD analysis of Fig. 2b, are consistent with earlier reports on the application of HPT method to metals39,56 and oxides.44,57

The generation of oxygen vacancies by HPT processing can be confirmed by different methods. (i) The first indication for the generation of oxygen vacancies is the change in the color of samples from white to black, as shown in Fig. 1c. The level of darkness increases with increasing the processing temperature, indicating that the oxygen vacancy concentration increases with increasing the temperature. Here, it should be noted that the application of HPT to pure ZrO2 and without addition of Y2O3 dopant also resulted in the dark color of sample, but the level of darkness was quite smaller than the ones in Fig. 1c due to the absence of phase transformation.37,44–46,50 Moreover, the application of HPT to Y2O3 did not result in dark color of sample,58 indicating that the oxygen vacancies should be formed in the ZrO2 phases and not in the Y2O3 dopant. (ii) The XPS spectra of the Zr 3d peak in Fig. 6a show extension or shift to lower energies after processing at high temperatures. However, after HPT processing at low temperatures, XPS do not provide any clear evidence for oxygen vacancy generation, indicating that the fraction of vacancies is not within the detection limits of XPS. (iii) Broad PL emission at 400 nm and 550 nm after HPT processing in Fig. 6b is also due to the radiative recombination of photo-excited holes and ionized oxygen vacancies in ZrO2 samples.59 The emission peak at 400 nm corresponds to deep oxygen vacancies where electrons transfer from the vacancies to the valence band60 and the peak at 550 nm corresponds to shallow oxygen vacancies where electrons transfer from the vacancies to the Zr4+ ions.61 (iv) EPR is another effective method for investigation of the paramagnetic oxygen vacancy defects. EPR signals in Fig. 6c show that major peaks with a g value of 2.00, corresponding to oxygen vacancies,62 exist for the HPT-processed samples especially for the samples processed at high temperatures, while such peaks are absent in the initial powder. It should be noted that no vacancy-induced changes in the lattice parameters were detected by XRD analysis, indicating that the concentrations of oxygen vacancies are not within the detection limits of XRD.

The influence of HPT processing and the resultant formation of oxygen vacancies on electronic structure of ZrO2 was investigated by UV-vis spectroscopy and UPS, as shown in Fig. 7 and 8. Examination of Fig. 7 and 8 reveals several important points. (i) The UV-vis spectra in Fig. 7a show that the light absorbance increases by HPT processing and by increasing the processing temperature in good agreement with the color of samples. (ii) Evaluation of UV-vis data using the Kubelka–Munk analysis63 in Fig. 7b shows that the bandgap is Eg = 5.1 eV for the initial powder, but it decreases to Eg = 4.0 eV, 4.0 eV, 4.3 eV, 4.3 eV and 4.3 eV after HPT processing at 300 K, 373 K, 473 K, 573 K and 673 K, respectively (see the effect of processing temperature on the bandgap in Fig. 7c). (iii) In Fig. 7b, there is a second slope for the HPT-processed samples which should correspond to the oxygen vacancy defect levels. The gaps corresponding to the oxygen vacancy states are 2.9 eV, 2.8 eV, 2.2 eV, 2.0 eV and 1.2 eV after HPT processing at 300 K, 373 K, 473 K, 573 K and 673 K, respectively. Although the bandgap of black ZrO2 is larger than black TiO2, its defect gap is comparable with 1.54 eV for black TiO2.29 (iv) The position of the valence band can be determined using the UPS spectra shown in Fig. 8a. The energy of cut-off position (E0) and valence band bottom (EVBM) are read from the UPS spectra (as shown as an example for the powder in Fig. 8a) and the energy of the valence band top and the conduction band bottom are calculated as EVBM = 21.2 − (E0 − EVBM) and ECBT = EVBT + Eg, respectively.64 As summarized in Fig. 8b, the main influence of HPT processing is the reduction of the conduction band bottom. It should be noted that the energy levels of valence band top and conduction band bottom for powder are reasonably consistent with theoretical works using the density functional theory (DFT).65–68 Moreover, the reliability of the measurements in Fig. 8b was confirmed by XPS valence band edge measurement as well. (v) Two defect levels, measured from the second slope in Fig. 7b, appear in Fig. 8b between the valence and conduction bands. These defect levels correspond to the shallow and deep oxygen vacancies, in good agreement with the PL spectra in Fig. 6b. (vi) The electronic structure of all samples satisfy the requirement for water splitting, i.e. their valence band energy is more negative than −5.6 eV for H2O/O2 conversion and their conduction band energy is more positive than −4.4 eV for H+/H2 conversion.64

The influence of HPT processing and formation of strain-induced oxygen vacancies on photocatalytic activity of ZrO2 is shown in Fig. 9. The results clearly indicate that the initial powder has low photocatalytic activity, whereas the HPT-processed samples show enhanced photocatalytic activity and the activity is improved with increasing the processing temperature. Taken altogether, strain-induced vacancies appear to be effective to produce low-bandgap materials with high photocatalytic activity. Here issues should be noted. First, the photocatalytic hydrogen production under visible light was minor in the range of 1.4 μmol m−2 within 180 min indicating that the materials developed in this study cannot be considered as visible-light-active photocatalysts. Second, the authors' experiments confirm that the HPT-processed pure ZrO2 and Y2O3 also show photocatalytic hydrogen production, but their activity is 82% and 63% of that for HPT-processed ZrO2 – 3 mol% Y2O3, respectively. Moreover, the bandgap of HPT-processed pure ZrO2 and Y2O3 are 4.7 eV and 4.6 eV, respectively, which are smaller than that for HPT-processed ZrO2 – 3 mol% Y2O3. Third, the maximum hydrogen production on HPT-processed ZrO2 – 3 mol% Y2O3 is 90 μmol m−2 in 180 min in Fig. 9, while the hydrogen production in 180 min on black ZrO2 and black TiO2 produced by chemical methods are 60 and 160 μmol m−2, respectively.21,29 It is concluded that the HPT-processed black ZrO2 – 3 mol% Y2O3 exhibits better photocatalytic activity than black ZrO2, but its activity is still lower than black TiO2.

Discussion
The current study introduces black ZrO2 as a candidate for photocatalysis. Unlike black TiO2 which is produced by chemical treatment,28–30 black ZrO2 is produced in this study by mechanical treatment via the HPT process. Black ZrO2 not only exhibits a clear reduction in the bandgap within the UV light range, but also a significant light absorbance even in the visible light region. Oxygen vacancies appear to be responsible for such changes in optical properties, although several other structural and microstructural changes occur during the HPT process. First, a tetragonal-to-monoclinic phase transformation occurs. Although the monoclinic phase has lower bandgap than the tetragonal phase,69 the difference between the bandgap of the two phases is not high enough to justify the bandgap reduction observed in this study. Second, the grain size is reduced after HPT processing, but the grain size reduction is expected to increase the bandgap, when the quantum size effect is dominated.70 It should be noted that the grain boundaries are generally considered as electron/hole recombination sites and reduce the photocatalytic activity.71 Third, edge dislocations and dislocation pile-ups form after HPT processing, but these lattice defects may also act as recombination sites similar to the grain boundaries. Here, it should be noted that continuous formation of dislocations and their pile-up can theoretically result in localized stress concentration and formation of active sites for nucleation of stress-induced phases and accordingly benefits for the formation of vacancies.72–74 Fourth, large fractions of monoclinic–tetragonal interphase boundaries are formed after HPT processing, which can act as active sites for charge carrier separation to diminish the electron/hole recombination.75–80 Despite the positive effect of interphases boundaries for photocatalysis, their formation cannot explain the significant light absorbance achieved after HPT processing. Taken altogether, formation of oxygen vacancies appears to be the main reason for enhanced optical and photocatalytic properties of black ZrO2.
Oxygen vacancies enhance the light absorbance, but there are different ideas whether these vacancies act negatively as recombination sites or act positively as active sites for photocatalysis.5,45,46,81 It was reported that not only bulk oxygen vacancies but also surface oxygen vacancies are needed to improve the photocatalytic activity and diminish the effect of vacancies on the electron/hole recombination.82 The HPT method is beneficial from this point of view, because it introduces oxygen vacancy all through the materials including surface and bulk. The formation of vacancies by HPT processing is a consequence of the strain effect on continues generation of point defects and of the pressure effect on suppression of defect annihilation.41–43 The formation of other lattice defects such as dislocations, subgrain boundaries and grain boundaries, which are considered undesirable for photocatalysis, is also due to similar effects of strain and pressure.38–48,52 This study together with earlier studies on the formation of oxygen vacancies in BaTiO3,44 TiO2,45 ZnO,46 TiO2–ZnO,50 Al2O3 (ref. 37) and tantalate perovskites52 confirm that phase transformation (i.e. significant atomic rearrangement) during HPT processing is essential for the introduction of vacancies. Although there are always some saturation limits for all kinds of lattice defects during the HPT process,55,83,84 the current results show that higher concentrations of oxygen vacancies can be achieved by increasing the processing temperature. Since the plasticity of crystalline materials improves with increasing the temperature, such enhanced plasticity should be responsible for increasing the concentration of strain-induced vacancies at high temperatures.41–43 It is concluded that the HPT process, which is mainly used for metal processing,39,84 is also an effective method to develop advanced photocatalysts such as black ZrO2 by introduction of strain-induced vacancies. The current, which is based on mechanical treatment using the HPT method, contrasts with earlier attempts in making black TiO2 and ZrO2 photocatalysts by chemical treatment.21,29 Moreover, in HPT processing oxygen vacancies are accumulated everywhere in the sample including bulk, surface, grains and grain boundaries and such an accumulation results in significant structure distortion.41–43 However, oxygen vacancies in chemically-synthesized black oxides usually form on the surface or in some distorted phases near the surface.85,86
Finally, it should be noted that since ZrO2-based ceramics are used in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) and it is well-known that oxygen vacancies benefit for electronic conductivity,87,88 the HPT-processed black ZrO2 can have a high potential for future applications in SOFCs. Furthermore, since black oxides with large concentration of oxygen vacancies exhibit good microwave and terahertz absorption,89–93 the HPT-processed black ZrO2 can be considered as a potential material for such microwave and terahertz absorption applications.
Conclusions
In summary, this study introduces a simple method to synthesize low-bandgap black ZrO2 as a potential photocatalyst for hydrogen production from water. This simple method is based on mechanical processing of powers by the high-pressure torsion (HPT) method to generate large concentration of oxygen vacancies. The applicability of the method is not necessarily limited to ZrO2 and it can be applied to any other oxides, provided that phase transformations and processing parameters such as temperature are set appropriately.
