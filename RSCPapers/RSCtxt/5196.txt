    , Accepted 9th December 2020First published on 10th December 2020AbstractThe ongoing surge in demand for high-performance wearable sensors for precisely monitoring vital signs of the human body or the surrounding environment has inspired the relentless pursuit of biocompatible and biodegradable advanced materials. Cellulose, as a class of well-known natural biopolymer on the Earth, presents distinctive integrated merits of good biocompatibility and biodegradability, easy processability into diverse material formats, and sustainable production on a large scale, as well as intrinsic shape anisotropy, surface charge/chemistry, and superior physical and mechanical properties. Such unique advantages have driven constant innovations in wearable and smart cellulose-containing sensors in the past few years. With the rapid development of fabrication techniques in material processing and progress in research, cellulose has been engineered into multidimensional architectures including 1D (nanofibers, fibers, and yarns), 2D (paper, films, and fabrics), and 3D (hydrogels, aerogels, foams, and sponges), which are further transformed into electrically conductive carbonaceous materials with tailorable structures and properties. Cellulose-derived materials have been developed as flexible biosupports or biosubstrates, sensing layers, electrodes and active components for wearable sensors by virtue of their favorable and unique material merits. In this review, the recent advances in the development of multidimensional and multifunctional cellulose-derived materials are discussed for wearable sensors toward healthcare and environment monitoring. First of all, the unique hierarchical and chemical structures and properties of cellulose are briefly introduced. Then, we summarize the fabrication strategies for processing cellulose into materials with multidimensional architectures. Additionally, the design and functionality of flexible wearable sensors developed with multidimensional cellulose-derived materials as biosubstrates, electrodes, active layers, and sensing components are presented in detail. In particular, cellulose-based advanced materials for self-powered sensors are also highlighted. Finally, some prospects on the future challenges in this emerging research field of designing cellulose-derived materials for wearable sensors are illustrated. This review may provide insightful inspiration for the design and utilization of cellulosic composites in flexible electronic devices with high-performance.

1. Introduction
Wearable electronic devices are capable of measuring a wide range of biophysical, biochemical, and environmental signals to provide critical insights into overall health status and to quantify human performance.1–3 Recent tremendous achievements in wearable and smart electronics have made significant improvements to our daily life.4,5 As a vital branch of wearable electronics, wearable and flexible sensors for real-time monitoring information on the state of the human body or the surrounding environment have been prosperously developed in personal healthcare, electronic skins, and human-machine interaction.6–8 Especially for body-integrated sensors, biocompatibility and, under certain circumstances, biodegradability are highly in-demand, along with mechanical robustness and flexibility to intimately integrate with the soft, curved, and time-dynamic surfaces of the body. An effective solution is using flexible intrinsic biopolymers and stretchable structural designs to construct wearable sensors.
Natural biopolymers, including cellulose, silk (silkworm silk and spider silk), chitosan, chitin, gelatin, collagen, and hyaluronic acid, offer a robust platform for applications in body-integrated sensors (e.g., biophysical sensors, biochemical sensors, and self-powered sensors).9–15 Furthermore, natural biopolymers possess unique combined advantages of hierarchical fibrous structures, well-controlled morphology, and surface functionality, which make them ideally suited for wearable sensor components.10,11 Cellulose, the most abundant natural biopolymer sourced from wood, plants, or bacteria, consists of a linear chain of β-(1 → 4)-linked D-glucose units.16–19 A large number of hydrogen bonds exist intra- and intermolecularly and yield different configurations of the cellulose structure. The nanoscale structures of cellulose (e.g., nanofibrils or nanocrystals) offer a unique combination of properties including flexible surface chemistry, transparency, low thermal expansion, high elasticity, and anisotropy.20–29 Besides, the intrinsic hydrophilicity, mechanical flexibility, and capability to construct three-dimensional hierarchical structures of cellulose fiber enable it to form stable and stiff structures with features ranging from rough paper or compact films to hydrogels or aerogels.17,29–34 Remarkably, cotton cellulose can be assembled into flexible yarns, fabrics, and textiles because of its excellent mechanical strength, light weight, and large-scale sustainable production. These combined characteristics make cellulose a perfect building block for rational integration with different functional micro- or nanomaterials to construct multidimensional and multifunctional platforms, which could meet the design requirements for sensor devices. Indeed, cellulosic materials are emerging as an appealing material platform for sensor-related applications owing to their electronic properties, ability to be processed into various morphologies with robust and flexible mechanical properties and programmable biodegradability. Typically, they have been developed as flexible biosubstrates, electrodes and active components for flexible electronics.14,16–34 More importantly, through a facile carbonization method, cellulosic materials can be transformed into electronically conductive carbon materials with tunable structures and properties, which have attracted tremendous interest from researchers as sensing components for wearable sensors.14,16,27
More recently, as the cellulose-based materials become more and more popular, many excellent reviews have been published.14,16–34 Most of them, however, are still in the area of processing cellulose molecules for energy storage devices, including supercapacitors and batteries.19,21,22,24,25,31 Although several recent reviews report the advances in the field of cellulose-based materials for sensors,14,27,34 they are not very comprehensive, with a specific focus on the type of paper-based sensors or single-purpose sensors (e.g., strain/pressure sensors and gas sensors).35,36 Consequently, there is still a lack of a comprehensive and updated review on the topic of cellulose-derived materials for physiological sensors, chemical sensors and self-powered sensors toward body health and surrounding environment monitoring. Herein, we summarize the latest progress in the development of cellulose-derived materials with structures designed and engineered for wearable sensors, including biophysical sensors, sweat sensors, gas sensors, and self-powered sensors. A comprehensive discussion on the processing–structure–performance–application correlations for cellulose-derived materials is also presented. Next, cellulose-derived materials as flexible biosubstrates, electrodes, sensing layers and active components for flexible and wearable sensors are introduced in detail. Further, we highlight some promising directions in future research and offer future perspectives for next-generation sensors based on cellulose- derived materials. This review may promote and inspire the emerging applications of cellulose as a sustainable advanced material and device in flexible wearable sensors.
2. Cellulose and cellulose-derived materials
2.1 Structure and properties of cellulose
As the most naturally abundant biopolymer on the Earth, cellulose is not only the most important nanostructured component occurring in wood, bamboo, cotton, hemp, agricultural byproducts, and other plant-based materials, but also one of the elementary structural units for marine algae, tunicates, and certain bacteria.32 The unique cellular hierarchical structure of a tree may be described as follows, spanning multiple orders of magnitude in dimensions37,38 (Fig. 1a): the hierarchical structure of wood originates from vessels and lumina in millimeters, and goes down to the multilayer structure of cell walls in micrometers. Cellulose (40–45%), hemicelluloses (20–35%), and lignin (20–30%), as the major constituents of wood cell walls, intertwine with each other, which thereby endows the wood with excellent mechanical properties.31 Wood cell walls consisting of cellulose bundles with diameters of several tens of nanometers can be further divided into cellulose microfibrils of 10–20 nm. At this nanometer scale, the elementary cellulose fibrils with diameters ranging from 1.5 to 3.5 nm bound into microfibrils, function as the fundamental building blocks of the hierarchical cellulose fibers and the aligned microfibrils are responsible for mechanical support of the cell walls thereby.14

The chemical structure and molecular asymmetry of cellulose are shown in Fig. 1b. At the molecular level, the repeated structural units of D-glucose are assembled into the linear and stiff cellulose chain via covalent bonding of oxygen molecules between the carbons on one glucose ring and those on the adjacent glucose as well as intra- and inter molecular hydrogen bonds (Fig. 1a). On the one hand, the intramolecular hydrogen bonds arising between –OH groups conveniently positioned within the same cellulose molecule stabilize the linkage, which consequently forms the linear configuration of the cellulose chain. On the other hand, the inter-molecular hydrogen bonds formed between adjacent cellulose chains create fibrillar structures and crystalline regions, ensuring cellulose's high mechanical strength and flexibility. Benefiting from the synergistic effect of inter-molecular hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic interactions, and van der Waals forces, the parallel stacking of individual cellulose chains is promoted, which further assemble into fibers.14,31,32 Additionally, cellulose shows the directional asymmetry, which is attributed to the terminal groups of each cellulose chain. Each cellulose chain possesses a reducing end (a hemiacetal group) and a non-reducing end (a pendant hydroxyl group)32,43 (Fig. 1b). Notably, the abundant hydroxyl groups occurring on the surface of the cellulose are emerging as a starting point for chemically introducing new functional molecules. In particular, the primary hydroxyl groups (–CH2OH) are easily chemically modified, which provides a wide range of applications for these novel materials.
In the cell walls of plants, cellulose microfibers (CMFs) are embedded in a matrix mainly containing lignin and hemicelluloses to form a composite, which provides structural support for the cell. By removing lignin and hemicelluloses from plants (e.g., wood and cotton) via chemical pretreatments, purified cellulose that usually presents as CMFs can be obtained14,39,40 (Fig. 1c). The fibrils consist of crystalline and amorphous regions (Fig. 1d), with the latter being preferably removed to release nanocelluloses from CMFs by top-down methods including mechanical, chemical, or a combination of mechanical, chemical, and enzymatic processes. Alternatively, nanocelluloses can also be produced by certain bacteria. Based on their source, preparation, and morphology (Fig. 1e and f), nanocellulose (NC) can be classified into three categories (Table 1): cellulose nanofibrils or nanofibers (CNFs), cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs), and bacterial cellulose (BC).14,16,22,24,25,31–34,42

Table 1 summarizes the fundamental physiochemical properties of diverse cellulose types. The unique properties of these cellulose entities (e.g., the ability of surface chemical modification and the capability to construct semicrystalline fiber morphologies) are combined with the specific characteristics of nanomaterials, which results in novel materials with well-designed morphologies, structures, and properties (e.g., large specific surface area (SSA)), abundant pore structure, excellent mechanical properties, and high electrical conductivity).22
CMFs (Fig. 1c), as a kind of flexible cellulose fibrils with a high aspect ratio, have typical lateral dimensions of 10 μm and the typical longitudinal dimension is several hundred micrometers. The Young's modulus of CMFs reaches up to 20–60 GPa, along with a typical surface area of 0.5–1.0 m2 g−1. The crystallinity of CMFs is usually low, and since water can penetrate through the fibers, there may be a large number of hydrogen bonds between water and cellulose molecules.14,22,25
On the one hand, CNFs (Fig. 1d and e2) can be produced by isolating CMFs. The disintegration of the fibers can be achieved by mechanical shearing and forces with suitable pretreatments including TEMPO-mediated oxidation or exposure to cellulose-specific enzymes. Compared to CMFs, CNFs, which present web-like entangled morphologies, have a higher aspect ratio. CNFs are usually 5 to 60 nm in the lateral dimension, and are typically long, being several micrometers in the longitudinal dimension. However, they display relatively low crystallinity (with both amorphous regions and crystalline regions) ranging from 50 to 90%.14,22,24,25,32
On the other hand, a strong acid hydrolysis, particularly sulfuric acid hydrolysis, can produce nanometer-long and elongated crystalline rod-like fragments (Fig. 1d and e1), referred to as CNCs (known as nanowhiskers). During the hydrolysis process, the acid solution can hydrolyze the paracrystalline regions and dislocations (disordered regions) of CMFs, while the crystalline regions are difficult to dissolve in acid and basically remain intact during the hydrolysis process. Thus, CNCs demonstrate shorter lengths and higher crystallinity than that of CNFs, and with much lower aspect ratios. Typically, CNCs are rods or whiskers, ranging from 3 to 50 nm in lateral dimension and 50–500 nm in longitudinal dimension. CNCs exhibit unique mechanical properties, including high axial stiffness (105–168 GPa), high Young's modulus (20–50 GPa), and high tensile strength (∼9 GPa). Meanwhile, CNCs also demonstrate distinctive physical properties of low coefficient of thermal expansion (∼0.1 ppm K−1), high thermal stability (∼260 °C), and low density (1.5–1.6 g cm−3).14,22,24,25,32
In contrast, BC is a class of nanocelluloses synthesized and secreted by several species of bacteria including Acetobacter, Agrobacterium, Sarcina, and Pseudomonas. Among them, the Gluconoacetobacter xylinus family has been developed as the most efficient producer. Compared with CNFs and CNCs derived from plants, BC contains only cellulose without other components, including hemicellulose and lignin. From the viewpoint of production and microstructure (Fig. 1f), the cell membrane of the bacteria employed to produce BC is composed of a cellulosic network structure of ribbon-shaped nanofibrils that are less than 100 nm wide, assembled from bundles of fine subfibrils with a diameter of 2–4 nm. The obtained BC fibril bundles have a diameter of 20–100 nm with a high aspect ratio and high crystallinity (84–89%), which consequently provide large SSA and porosity and distinctive mechanical properties (elastic modulus of 78 GPa). Besides, BC also presents some other unique physical properties, such as strong water-retention capacity (water content to 99%), high degree of polymerization (molecular weight up to 8000 Da), moldability, and hydrophilicity.14,22,24,25,32,33
2.2 Processing technologies and morphologies of cellulose-derived materials
Natural plant fibers have been processed into paper on a large scale in the paper industry for centuries. Similarly, cotton fibers have been utilized for yarns and fabrics (woven, knitted, and nonwoven structures) in our daily life. The easy processability, large-scale production and inherent characteristics of cellulose make it ideally suited for the preparation of cellulose-based functional materials for wearable sensors. By systematically designing the structures, controlling the surface/interface chemistry, and integrating modern processing technologies including inkjet/screen printing, spray/spin coating, pen-writing, 3D printing, and blending and filtration (Fig. 2a),23,44–47 cellulose has been successfully engineered into multidimensional material formats such as nanofibers/fibers/yarns,48–50 paper/films/fabrics,49,51 and hydrogels/aerogels/sponges (Fig. 2b).52–54 The plentiful material formats with well-designed structures and morphologies, combined with excellent mechanical performance (e.g., flexibility, mechanical strength and robustness, and stretchability), good biocompatibility and biodegradability, and novel optical/electronic properties, provide a broad prospect of cellulose-derived materials for wearable sensors. For instance, via a coating technique, a wearable UV sensor was demonstrated using a cellulose-based thread coated with single-wall carbon nanotube ink by a coating technique.50 A high-performance capacitive pressure sensor was also fabricated by drawing loop and disc-shaped graphite electrode arrays on copying tissues.45 Due to the foam-like porous structure of thin, soft and robust paper, the capacitive pressure sensor constructed from graphene oxide-reinforced paper enables sensitive detection of finger touch, motion and proximity. The cellulose in these models functions as a flexible substrate and an efficient dielectric layer, presenting outstanding mechanical properties (favorable flexibility and excellent foldability). Beyond the usage of cellulose for the flexible substrate and dielectric layer, cellulose can function as a molecular print board for the covalent printing of functional small-molecule inks to produce wearable sensors. For example, combining the 3D printing technique with the ink from cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs), deep eutectic solvents (DESs), and ionically cross-linked polyacrylic acid (PAA), scientists have developed robust hydrogels as sensors with complex 3D structures.55

On the other hand, facing the serious environmental pollution of the nonbiodegradable plastic waste produced by petroleum-based synthetic polymers, the utilization of renewable biomass resources to manufacture eco-friendly materials has become increasingly attractive. As the most abundant sustainable polymer, cellulose is expected to function as a promising substitute for synthetic polymers by virtue of its biodegradability and biocompatibility, low cost, and wide availability. However, the abundant intra- and inter molecular hydrogen bonds existing in cellulose chains result in difficult dissolution and processing for cellulose, restricting its exploitation. Recent decades have witnessed great achievements for developing cellulose “green” solvents and high-strength and robust regenerated cellulose materials through the “bottom-up” route.15,28,65,132,140 Cellulose can be regenerated to prepare multidimensional and multifunctional materials (e.g., filaments/fibers, papers/films, and hydrogels/aerogels) via a series of “green solvents” including alkali/urea solutions (e.g., NaOH, LiOH, and KOH/urea), organic-base aqueous solutions, molten inorganic salt hydrates, LiCl/N,N-dimethylacetamide (LiCl/DMAc), tetra butyl ammonium fluoride/dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), N-methylmorpholine-N-oxide (NMMO), metal-complex solutions, and ionic liquids.15,28 Importantly, these cellulosic materials can be biodegraded in soil and oceans, relieving pollution of the environment greatly. As a consequence, these unique merits of cellulose are combined with the development of fabrication techniques in material processing, endowing cellulose with promising potential in the design and study of wearable sensors.
2.3 Cellulose-derived carbon materials by pyrolysis
In addition to cellulose-derived materials with diverse morphologies, cellulose can be transformed into carbon materials via a facile carbonization by virtue of its unique molecular structure.56–58Fig. 3a illustrates the char formation from the cellulose through heat treatment.56 Cellulose chains undergo depolymerization as well as dehydration and isomerization reactions to form anhydrosugars, which further experience dehydration reactions as well as fragmentation and retroaldol condensation reactions to form furans. Notably, the dehydration, decarbonylation and decarboxylation reactions lead to releasing gas molecules of H2O, CO and CO2, which are responsible for pore-rich structures of cellulose-derived carbon materials (e.g., porous carbon aerogel and carbonaceous fibers). Carbon with a chaos graphite construction is formed from polymerization of the pyrolysis products, referred to as char. Fig. 3b and c confirm that small distorted lattice fringes with an interlayer thickness of 0.35 and 0.34 nm, which belonged to sp2 bonded graphited carbon (e.g., the (002) plane of graphite), were irregularly embedded throughout the whole carbonized cotton fabric57 and paper.58 Natural biopolymer-derived carbon materials show remarkable potential for the fabrication of low-cost, large-scale, and environment-friendly flexible electronics on account of their abundant renewable resources and electrically conductive features. Carbon materials derived from cellulose present combined unique advantages of excellent electrical conductivity, outstanding mechanical properties, well-designed structures and versatile morphologies, which offer a promising platform for the design of wearable sensors.

3. Structural design and engineering of cellulose-derived materials for flexible wearable sensors
The inherent structures and unique properties of cellulose, combined with advanced processing technologies, make it beneficial for constructing multidimensional cellulose-based functional materials, which are a robust platform for the design of wearable sensors. In particular, 1D nanofibers/fibers/yarns exhibit remarkable mechanical robustness and flexibility, allowing them to be assembled into flexible films/paper/fabrics and providing great opportunities of exploring cellulose-derived materials for portable and wearable electronics. Besides, cellulose-based hydrogels realize a combination of outstanding mechanical performance (e.g., mechanical strength and robustness, stretchability, and compressibility), reliable self-adhesive, self-healing, and anti-freezing ability, and good transparency. Importantly, cellulose-based aerogels with rationally designed morphologies and structures demonstrate excellent electrical conductivity. These combined distinctive advantages make cellulose highly attractive for the fabrication of wearable sensors toward health and environment monitoring (Table 2).59–196

3.1 One-dimensional cellulose fibers as biosupports for flexible wearable sensors
One-dimensional cellulose fiber shows distinctive integrated merits of unique structures, mechanical flexibility and robustness, good biocompatibility and biodegradability, and easy processing, which makes it an ideal green multifunctional substrate for wearable sensors. Functional inorganic and organic building blocks (e.g., carbon nanomaterials, metallic nanomaterials, metallic oxides and salts, and conductive polymers) are always introduced into the interconnected nanofiber network to obtain freestanding multidimensional conductive materials (e.g., fibers/yarns, paper/films, and hydrogels/aerogels/sponges) as sensing components (Fig. 4).25,33 In this respect, cellulosic conductive materials can be collected in three typical structures including coating of active materials on the surface of individual cellulose fibers or nanofibers, homogeneous dispersions of active materials within the cellulose network, and interlocking active materials and cellulose networks. Remarkably, the obtained electrically conductive and functional fibers or yarns that can be assembled into fabrics/textiles via textile technologies are crucial components for electronic textiles (E-textiles).

3.1.1 Cellulose-based composite fibers and textiles for flexible wearable sensors. 
Wearable sensing fibers/yarns possess outstanding mechanical strength and flexibility and excellent sensing functionality, which are vital to realize smart fabric sensors.49,59–68 Carbon-based fibers (e.g., carbon nanotubes (CNTs), graphene, graphene oxide (GO) and reduced graphene oxide (RGO)), as common functional inorganics, can be integrated with cellulose fibers or yarns via reduction, spinning, doping, and coating. For instance, Cho et al.49 developed large-scale wearable tunicate nanocellulose (TCNF)/CNT composite fibers with superior sensing functionality and excellent mechanical performance through introducing CNTs into NC (Fig. 5a), which were continuously synthesized along alignment directions via wet spinning. Benefiting from the open porous structure composed of macropores on the entire surface, the TCNF/CNT composite fibers were demonstrated as wearable gas (NO2) sensors, showing high selectivity and sensitivity (parts-per-billion detection) (Fig. 5b). Additionally, the TCNF/CNT composite fibers were able to work stably under severe mechanical deformations without deterioration of the sensing properties and could be further incorporated into textiles by a direct weaving process (Fig. 5c). In addition to individual integration with cellulose fibers, CNTs that are further combined with conductive polymers (e.g., polypyrrole (PPy) and polyaniline (PANI)) serve as functional components for smart cellulose yarns. Fig. 5d illustrates a combined process of multiple spinning, dip coating, and polymerization for cotton/CNT sheath-core yarn deposited with PPy, which could be used for stretchable wearable strain sensors.59 The obtained multilayered structure yarn presented a four-layered sheath-core structure (Fig. 5e1 and e2), which was used for the fabrication of a twisted yarn supercapacitor (Fig. 5e3). The extremely large workable strain sensing range and superior sensitivity made cellulose yarn-based strain sensors promising candidates for the real-time detection of tiny-scale and large-scale bodily activities (Fig. 5f). Similarly, a core-sheath CNF/graphene (GE) @PANI microfiber was constructed by in-situ deposition of highly oriented PANI nanorod arrays on the surface of the GE/CNF core microfibers that were synthesized by wet spinning (Fig. 5g).60Fig. 5h1 describes the possible interactions among GE, CNFs and PANI, including the π–π stacking, the electrostatic interaction, and hydrogen bonding. The GE/CNFs@ PANI microfibers were knotted without any fractures, indicating outstanding mechanical flexibility (Fig. 5h2). The well-designed GE/CNFs@PANI microfibers exhibited mechanical robustness and superior thermal sensitivity because the multicomponent hierarchically synergistic design made the full use of the distinctive properties and synergistic effect among components. Such combined unique merits made the GE/CNFs@PANI microfibers greatly suited for sensing units of a temperature sensor with fast response capability that could accurately monitor human body temperature (Fig. 5i). To develop a wearable multifunctional sensor with body motions and environmental temperature monitoring, Jing et al.61 demonstrated regenerated and rotation-induced cellulose-wrapped oriented CNT fibers that were achieved for the first time by coaxial wet-spinning with a rotating coagulation bath (Fig. 5j). It should be noted that the diffusion-controlled solvent exchange process determined the reconstruction of the hydrogel network in the final CNTs@cellulose coaxial fibers (Fig. 5k). The fibers could not only be knotted tightly without any breakdown (Fig. 5l1), but also bore 10000 times their own weight (Fig. 5l2), proving flexible mechanical properties, outstanding knittability, and mechanical robustness. Moreover, a wearable strain sensor constructed form the coaxial fibers presented an ultra-fast response time with excellent stability, which was capable of continuously sensing bodily movements in real time, including finger and knee motions (Fig. 5m1). The coaxial fiber-based temperature sensor also showed excellent temperature-sensitive properties, accurately measuring environmental temperature variations (Fig. 5m2). As mentioned above, introducing conductive functional materials into cellulose fibers or yarns provided promising versatile building blocks for wearable smart fabric sensors.

As a significant class of fiber-shaped sensing materials, electrically conductive and functional fibers or yarns that show combined unique advantages of excellent mechanical strength, flexibility, wearability, and sensing functionality can be incorporated into wearable smart textiles in distinct forms through weaving functional components into conventional cellulose-based fabrics including cotton, bamboo, and linen.69,70 As shown in Fig. 6a and c, the highly conductive and electroactive MXene-coated cellulose-based yarns fabricated via a facile two-step dip-coating process, were demonstrated.69 To achieve the maximum MXene loading of the yarn, the twisted fibers were initially saturated with S-Ti3C2 MXene flakes before coating with L-Ti3C2 MXenes to cover the yarn surface and eventually the surface became relatively smooth, leading to a continuous conductive pathway along the yarn surface (Fig. 6b). Furthermore, via adjusting the stitch patterns (geometric construction of the knitted loops) such as single jersey, half-gauge, and interlock, the MXene-coated cellulose-based yarns were successfully knitted into full fabrics with well-controlled porosity and thickness on an industrial knitting machine (Fig. 6c). Importantly, through employing two knitted fabric electrodes and a sandwiched dielectric layer (Fig. 6d), the assembled capacitive pressure sensor that delivered a high sensitivity with a gauge factor (GF) = 6.02, a broad compression sensing range of ≈20%, and superior cycling stability was able to detect gentle, moderate, and hard finger pressures as well as diverse levels of weights (Fig. 6e). Aside from the knitting process, the multifunctional cellulose-based composite fibers can be directly assembled into flexible smart textiles by a 3D printing process. As illustrated in Fig. 6f, wearable smart fibres and textiles were produced by using 3D printing with hybrid inks consisting of TEMPO (2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxylradical)-mediated oxidized cellulose nanofibrils (TOCNFs) and Ti3C2 MXene, displaying an aligned structure in ethanol.70 Because of the hydrogen bonds existing between 1D TOCNFs and 2D Ti3C2 nanosheets and their inherent attributes, the resulting composite fibres exhibited intriguing comprehensive properties such as superior mechanical strength and robustness (Fig. 6g1), as well as excellent electrical conductivity and could be further self-assembled into flexible multifunctional textiles (Fig. 6g2). Remarkably, the smart TOCNFs/Ti3C2 textile could be processed into a stretchable, skin-mountable, and wearable strain sensor with fascinating combined properties, including outstanding mechanical flexibility, great sensitivity, and superior durability (Fig. 6h) and simultaneously was capable of accurately sensing bodily activities in real time, including human joint motion (e.g., finger and wrist bending), subtle physiological signals (e.g., throat swallowing), and distinct pronunciations (e.g., “Hello” and “NIHAO”) (Fig. 6i and j). As outlined above, these established approaches combine the versatile chemistry and promising electrical properties of functional inorganic and organic materials with the existing cellulose-based fibers and yarns, providing a robust platform technology for diverse fabric-based sensors via allowing tunability in performance for the crucial building blocks of fabrics.

3.1.2 Cellulose-based composite films for flexible wearable sensors. 
With the latest progress in flexible soft electronics and natural biopolymers, wearable and skin-attachable sensors that can be stably mounted on the clothing or even directly fixed on soft biological tissue and monitor biophysical, biochemical, and environmental status from the human body are being prosperously developed by incorporating rigid sensitive elements into a flexible and soft thin-film configuration.71–89 However, these wearable sensors are prone to damage by external forces during usage. As one of the possible solutions to such issues, extensive interest has arisen in developing multifunctional composite film-based self-healing wearable sensors that are able to recover their original properties after being damaged for the purpose of increasing the life span and reducing electronic waste. A typical example was the facile fabrication of thin and foldable self-healable temperature sensors on polyvinyl alcohol/cellulose nanocrystal (PVA/CNC) nanocomposite film by vacuum filtration and pattern transfer techniques, which realized a combination of extremely remarkable mechanical stability, reliable self-healing ability, and superior sensing properties (Fig. 7a and b).71 Spraying water on the film surface could activate the self-healing capability of the PVA/CNC nanocomposite film through dynamically reversible hydrogen bonds (Fig. 7a). The temperature sensor that was attached to a double beaker at a temperature of 15 °C using a thermostat and demonstrated a sensitivity of 0.67% K−1 with a response time of 0.2 s could detect repeated finger touch in real time (Fig. 7b). To develop a high-performance humidity sensor with mechanical flexibility and especially transparency to meet the requirements of integration into an intelligent wearable device, Wang et al.72 demonstrated a high-performance humidity sensor based on a transparent and flexible cellulose/KOH composite ionic film (CKF). As displayed in Fig. 7c, due to its compact and homogeneous structure, CKF possessed excellent properties including high transparency, mechanical flexibility, and mechanical robustness. The flexible and transparent CKF-based humidity sensor that showed a wide relative humidity (RH) sensing range of 11.3–97.3% and fast response/recovery times of 6.0/10.8 s was capable of detecting non-contact fingertip moisture and breathing rate in real time. Interestingly, a wearable skin moisture detector made from the transparent CKF could monitor the skin moisture under different states. Different from humidity sensors that can use electron- or ion-transport channels, photonic humidity sensors can display and hide structural colors in the visible range in response to RH changes. In a representative example, a high-performance photonic humidity sensor was fabricated on the chiral nematic cellulose nanocrystal/polyacrylamide composite film that induced chemical bonding using glutaraldehyde (GA) as a bridging agent (Fig. 7d).73 Owing to polyacrylamide swelling with water and enlarging the helical pitch of the chiral nematic structure, a composite film-based humidity indicator that demonstrated a high sensitivity could shift from green to red as relative humidity increased from 11% to 97%. Moreover, the photonic humidity sensor delivered superior cycling stability, which was attributed to the strong bonding between polyacrylamide and CNCs.

Recently, nanostructured materials have demonstrated great potential in constructing highly sensitive wearable sensors.74–76 For example, Kang et al.74 reported a nanoparticle-nanofibrous film as a tunable interfacial scaffold for a flexible sweat sensor via incorporating gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) into a three-layer structured nanofibrous film composed of nonwoven polyethyleneterephthalate (PET) fibre as the support layer, electrospun polyacrylonitrile (PAN) nanofibre as the mid layer, and CNF as the top layer using molecular or polymeric linkers (Fig. 7e). The nanoparticle-nanofibrous film as a scaffold of a chemical resistor-type platform was able to detect ions in solutions with dissolved salts and various relative humidities in the gas phase. More importantly, this class of nanocomposite films was further used as a flexible sensor strip that could detect variations of a volunteer's sweat and perspiration before and after exercise. Apart from nanostructured materials, the porous structure is of equal importance for designing sensors. As shown in Fig. 7f, cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) functioned as a versatile template to assist the synthesis of highly porous thin films of nanostructured tin dioxide (SnO2) with pore dimensions in the range of 10–20 nm (ABET = 46–64 m2 g−1).75 Because of the large surface area of the nanocomposite films, a resistive gas sensor based on CNC-templated SnO2 films displayed high sensitivity to carbon monoxide (CO) in ppm concentrations and low cross-sensitivity to humidity. More interestingly, in contrast with commercial SnO2-based CO sensors, the sensing kinetics were faster and both the response to the analyte gas and the signal attenuation after gas exposure occurred within a few seconds. Although great progress has been achieved in electrochemical gas sensors, continuous efforts are needed to overcome current challenges, including aqueous electrolyte leakage and efficient solid ion-conducting electrolytes at room temperature. More recently, cofunctionalized biopolymer/2D material-solid electrolytes with well-designed structures have been developed as an efficient and green strategy and successfully applied in electrochemical gas sensors.76 A case in point was the cofunctionalized cellulose nanofiber (CNF)/graphene oxide (GO) nanocomposite membrane with a 3D interpenetrating network structure (Fig. 7g), which had proton conductivity and was employed as a solid electrolyte in an electrochemical gas sensor for the detection of alcohol (ethanol). As shown in Fig. 7h, the ethanol gas sensor designed on the basis of the direct ethanol fuel cell principle, namely an alcohol fuel cell sensor (AFCS), demonstrated potential applications in safe driving alcohol detection.
Currently, wearable wireless sensors play a key role in collecting data generated from all of our actions by IoT devices and in analyzing big data.77–79 For example, a highly sensitive, reliable, wireless, and wearable multifunctional sensor was achieved using a flexible nanocomposite film composed of two one-dimensional nanomaterials with CNF as the organic matrix and ZnO NRs as the sensing materials and presented excellent conductivity stability, high photoresponsivity properties, and humidity sensing performance.77 More attractively, a wireless smart band containing a CNF/ZnO NR film sensor was constructed and connected to a smartphone by Bluetooth, operating under UV irradiation (Fig. 7i). Other than the temperature sensor, humidity sensor, sweat sensor, and gas sensor, the cellulose-based composite films also have demonstrated unique value for the design of strain and pressure sensors. In the first example, a self-healing and self-adhesive conductive PPy-coated NC/PVA nanocomposite film was fabricated by the multiple interactions of weak H-bonds and Fe3+ ion chelation and synergy among CNC/CNF, PPy, and PVA (Fig. 7j).78 The flexible nanocomposite film possessed high strain sensitivity (GF = 2) under low strains (<48.5%), which was able to sense large-scale and tiny-scale bodily activities including finger bending motions, swallowing, and wrist pulse (Fig. 7k). In another example, the shape-memory and self-assembly properties of hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC) were integrated into multilayered flexible thin-film architectures to develop an ultra-adaptable, stretchable, wearable and multipixel photonic skin that could be used to precisely monitor human and structural health and gas leakage by optical transduction (Fig. 7l).79 As described in Fig. 7m, the HPC skin seamlessly mounted onto a human volunteer's arm could perceive subtle variations in the motions or postures of the arm through resultant distinct mapping patterns. Similarly, the photonic skin conformably fixed on a plate was capable of directly visualizing any mode of structural failure and elongation of a model cable by responsive coloration. In addition, the photonic skin tightly wrapping the pipe was able to directly perceive the exact location of the gas leakage via intuitive, instant visible colors.


3.1.3 Cellulose-based composite hydrogels for flexible wearable sensors. 
Taking advantage of gelation chemistry with versatile and tunable cellulose molecular building blocks and rational combination with functional organics and inorganics, cellulose-based composite hydrogels can achieve attractive and tailorable physiochemical properties that are emerging as a promising material platform for wearable sensors.90–145 In this section, we present an in-depth discussion of the structure–property–application relationships of cellulose-based hydrogel materials based on well-controlled structures, well-designed functions (e.g., desirable ionic and electronic conductivities, mechanical strength and toughness, structural flexibility, perfect stretchability, desired transparency, and stimulus-responsiveness, as well as reliable self-healing, self-adhesive, and anti-freeze properties), and sensor-related applications in health and environment monitoring.
Bionic electronic skin (E-skin) that is capable of converting external physical or mechanical stimulation into output electric signals is broadly reported and integrated into various fields involving artificial tissues, wearable electronics, personalized health systems, and so forth.90–116 For example, inspired by chameleons (Fig. 8a), Zhang et al.95 demonstrated a multifunctional E-skin based on HPC, PACA (poly(acrylamide-co-acrylic acid)), and CNT-composited liquid-crystal hydrogel (Fig. 8b). The HPC could produce cholesteric liquid-crystal photonic structures for improving their color saturation after being combined with CNTs and the assembled periodic structures were located by PACA polymerization (Fig. 8c). Because of the multi-sensitive responsivity of the HPC elements and the PACA scaffold, the E-skin assembled by the composite hydrogel was able to perform optical sensing of external stimuli such as pressure, tension, and temperature via color migration caused by internal nanostructural or volume variations. Additionally, introducing CNTs could allow the composite hydrogel to transform these stimuli into output electrical resistance signals. Consequently, the composite hydrogel-based E-skins enabled a direct and intuitive visualization of external stimuli by eye-readable colorations as well as quantitatively respond to external stimuli by electrical resistance (Fig. 8d and e). Such dual-signal sensing capability makes the electrically conductive cellulose-based hydrogels greatly suitable for designing and fabricating multifunctional wearable and smart E-skins. Similarly, mimicking response mechanism and perceptive functions of human skin, Zhao et al.96 presented a cellulosic dynamic gel-based E-skin that only contained cellulose, ions, and H2O. As ions and H2O could regulate the hydrogen-bond topological network among the components, the cellulose ionic hydrogel (Cel-IL dynamic gel) possessed reversibly tunable microstructures and properties involving self-healing, adhesion, mechanical strength and toughness, and ionic conductivity (Fig. 8f and g). A biomimetic E-skin device made from the Cel-IL dynamic gel (C-E-skin) realized a combination of outstanding flexibility, good transparency, and excellent scalability, which was seamlessly attached on and easily detached from the volunteer skin without inflammatory response and residual (Fig. 8h). The highly sensitive C-E-skin devices were capable of perceiving diverse breathing states (quiet, nervousness, impatience, illness, or health), finger touching, and the surrounding environment (e.g., air flow, temperature, and moisture) (Fig. 8i), opening a new chapter in application prospects.

On the other hand, cellulose-based composite hydrogels also have demonstrated important value as flexible sensors.117–145 In particular, ionic conductive cellulose-based hydrogels possess unique advantages of desirable transparency and robust freezing-tolerance ability. A classic example was the CNF-reinforced transparent and freezing-tolerant ionic conductive organohydrogel, which was easily prepared by gelation of PVA and CNFs in the dimethyl sulfoxide-water (DMSO/H2O) solvent system and displayed high stretchability, high mechanical strength and robust toughness, and high ionic conductivity (Fig. 9a).117 The organohydrogel showed remarkable freezing-tolerance behavior that could remain flexible and conductive even at −70 °C by virtue of the presence of the binary DMSO/H2O solvent (Fig. 9b). Intriguingly, the organohydrogel presented outstanding sensitivity and signal stability, and thus was assembled into multifunctional wearable sensors to sense the full range of bodily activities. As illustrated in Fig. 9c, the organohydrogel-based pressure sensor was applied to perceive slight muscle variations for personal healthcare applications, involving the radial pulse at the wrist. To develop a cellulose nanocomposite hydrogel with simultaneous realization of superior self-healing and self-adhesive ability and high toughness by mimicking human skin functions, multiple coordination bonds among tannic acid-coated cellulose nanocrystals (TA@CNCs), poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) chains, and metal ions were exploited to endow the ionic hydrogels with reliably autonomous mechanical and electrical self-healing ability and TA@CNCs were designed as dynamically connected bridges in the covalent and hierarchical porous polymer network to improve the mechanical performance of the ionic hydrogels.118 More intriguingly, attributed to the existence of catechol groups in TA, the ionic hydrogels presented repeatable and durable adhesiveness that had seamless interface adhesion to and could be easily detached from the volunteer skin without tissue damage and with no residue (Fig. 9d). Additionally, a greatly strain-sensitive sensor made with the ionic hydrogel could detect the full range of human activities involving large-scale movements (e.g., joint bending) and tiny-scale motions (e.g., pulse and breathing) (Fig. 9e), allowing the analysis of data on smartphone user interfaces through programmable wireless transmission. Similarly, inspired by the hierarchical network structures, mechanical performance and self-healing functions, and response mechanism of biological soft tissues, Liu et al.119 successfully fabricated a stretchable soft strain sensor based on synergistic “soft and hard” hybrid network ionic hydrogels with a combination of robust, elastic, stretchable, and autonomous self-healing capability, and excellent sensing sensitivity. The interpenetrating “soft” homogeneously polymeric network and “hard” dynamically cross-linked CNCs–Fe3+ network endowed hydrogels with outstanding mechanical performance. Notably, ascribed to the reconstruction of dynamically reversible CNCs–Fe3+ coordination bonds, the hydrogels also demonstrated reliable fast self-healable ability (Fig. 9f). Furthermore, benefiting from the hierarchical porous networks, the hydrogels exhibited great sensitivity, ultrafast response, and remarkable reliability, which consequently functioned as a skin-mountable wearable strain sensor to detect and discriminate large-scale human activities (finger bending), physiological parameters (breathing status), and subtle muscle movements (blood pulse in relaxation and after exercise) (Fig. 9g). In addition to CNFs and CNCs, BC could also be designed to form multifunctional hydrogels with well-controlled morphologies and structures to obtain high-performance wearable sensors. For instance, Wang et al.120 prepared a stretchable, transparent and tough ionic hydrogel based on natural BC and PDESs (polymerizable deep eutectic solvents) (top image in Fig. 9h). The BC-reinforced ionic hydrogel showed impressive mechanical stability that maintained superior mechanical strength and flexibility even on exposure to the humid environment (bottom images in Fig. 9h), which was attributed to its ultra-strong 3D nanofiber network and robust interface interaction. Besides, the BC-PDES ionic hydrogel displayed multiple-sensing behaviors upon mechanical deformations (tension, pressure, and bending) and temperature. On the basis of the multiple sensitivity, the hydrogels could serve as ultrasensitive sensors to monitor and distinguish full range bodily movements involving limb motions and throat vibrations (coughing and drinking) as well as biophysical activities (handwriting) (Fig. 9i).

3.1.4 Cellulose-based composite aerogels/foams/sponges for flexible wearable sensors. 
Similar to incorporating functional elements into cellulose-based hydrogels, cellulose-based aerogels/foams/sponges have been integrated with functional elements for the fabrication of versatile composite aerogels/foams/sponges.146–158 They inherit the structural features and physicochemical properties of nanoscale building blocks, and combine typical features of aerogels, involving high porosity, continuous and homogeneous networks, large surface area, and low density, with unique functions of the different components. Such integrated characteristics endow cellulose-based composite aerogels with great sensitivity, excellent selectivity, high reliability, and rapid response and recovery for sensing materials in diverse sensors (e.g., strain and pressure sensors, gas sensors, temperature sensors, and humidity sensors). Taking into consideration the latest progress in cellulose-based composite aerogels for flexible wearable sensors, we provide an in-detail introduction in terms of the relationships among the morphologies, structures, properties and applications of cellulose-based composite aerogels.
AgNWs, as a common functional inorganic nanomaterial, can be integrated with cellulose fibers into conductive composite aerogels/foams/sponges by blending, freeze drying, and dip-coating. A conductive and compressible cracked CNF/AgNW layer-coated PU (CA@PU) sponge with the interconnected 3D porous structure was developed by a facile dip-coating process (Fig. 10a).146 CNFs could facilitate the dispersion of the AgNWs and provide robust adhesion between the layers. Because of the “crack effect”, the CA@PU sponges were applied as flexible piezoresistive sensors with high sensitivity (GF = 26.07) and low detection limit of 0.2% strain. The results showed that the CA@PU sponge-based sensor could monitor both full-range bodily movements including large movements (e.g., knee bending) and subtle muscle vibration (e.g., phonation) and an object placed onto its top (Fig. 10b and c). Carbon nanomaterials have also been combined with cellulose fibers to construct multifunctional aerogels/foams/sponges for flexible wearable sensors on account of their excellent electrical conductivities.147 In order to achieve an anisotropic structure inside the material, some advanced arrangement technologies (e.g., unidirectional freeze drying, force induction, and salting out) have been exploited to improve the morphology and structure of cellulose-based materials.151 As illustrated in Fig. 10d, an anisotropic micro-honeycomb CNF/CNT aerogel (MCCA) with unidirectionally arranged penetrating microchannels was synthesized through a unidirectional freeze-drying process, utilizing the structure-oriented function of the CNFs.147 Owing to its anisotropy, MCCA-reinforced polydimethylsiloxane (MCCA/PDMS) exhibited obvious anisotropic performance and its electrical conductivity and Young's modulus parallel to the direction of the penetrating microchannel were about twice those in the perpendicular direction. Moreover, the “directional” strain sensors made with the MCCA/PDMS showed anisotropic sensitivity ratios with a 92% sensitivity difference between the parallel to microchannel direction and the perpendicular direction during the testing of the strain sensor (Fig. 10e and f).

Apart from metal nanomaterials and carbon nanomaterials, conductive conjugated polymers have also been developed for combination with cellulose fibers for high-performance cellulose composite aerogel-based sensors by virtue of their good biocompatibility, mechanical flexibility, and high conductivity.148–150 As depicted in Fig. 10g, a supramolecular self-assembly of 3D conductive aerogel (SA) was designed with 1D supramolecular CNF/PANI core–shell fibers assembled by hydrogen bonds that were formed into shell-like structures, demonstrating hierarchically porous 3D structures, excellent flexibility, superior shape recovery abilities, and a high electrical conductivity.148 More importantly, the lightweight conductive CNF/PANI SA served as a multi-response sensor for real-time detection of both various toxic gases (e.g., C2H5OH gas, CHCl3 gas, and C7H8 gas) in the surrounding environment and full-range bodily movements such as large-scale finger joint motions and subtle pulse beats (Fig. 10h), which showed great potential in health and environment monitoring. However, most of the previous studies on measuring and collecting physiological and physical parameters, which focused on the integration of individual single parameter sensors into the sensor system, were extremely complex. Thus, it is greatly desirable to construct one single-sensor device that can concurrently and continuously monitor multiple physiological or physical parameters without crosstalk between the recorded parameters. Herein, Han et al.149 designed a polymeric mixed ionic–electronic conductor (MIEC) aerogel with a porous microstructure that was composed of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)/poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) and nanofibrillated cellulose (NFC) (Fig. 10i). The mixed ionic–electronic cellulose-based composite aerogel could simultaneously and consecutively measure pressure–temperature–humidity (P–T–H) with minimal crosstalk in one single device configuration by combining electronic and ionic Seebeck effect with mixed ion–electron conduction in an elastic aerogel (Fig. 10j, k, and l), making it promising for environmental detection. Other than external environment monitoring, cellulose-based composite aerogels were designed for wearable human motion detection. For instance, Huang et al.150 assembled a lightweight conductive cellulose-based aerogel containing the interconnected pore network by in situ polymerization of aniline monomers in bacterial cellulose/chitosan (BC/CH) composites, using a freeze-drying method (Fig. 10m). The PANI/BC/CH aerogels demonstrated for piezoresistive pressure sensors showed great sensitivity (1.41 kPa−1), low compressive stress detection limit (32 Pa), and superior stability, when fixed on the bottom of shoes to record jogging signals (Fig. 10n).

3.2 Cellulose fabrics as biosubstrates for flexible wearable sensors
The intriguing mechanical strength, unique porosity, and large-scale sustainable production of cellulose fabrics (CFs) are appealing for use in CF-based flexible wearable sensors (Table 3).159–163 While CF itself is not conductive, it can function as a flexible biosubstrate that is integrated with functional components (e.g., electrochemically active materials and conductive agents) for multifunctional fabrics, such as smart fabrics, conductive fabrics, sensor fabrics, and electronic fabrics (Fig. 11a).159 Conductive fabrics, as fundamental elements for sensor fabrics, can be prepared by incorporation of conductive agents via diverse techniques involving dip-coating, in-situ polymerization, electroless deposition of metal, screen-printing, evaporative deposition, and sputter coating. As shown in Fig. 11b and c, benefiting from the superior hydrophilicity of cellulose and the abundant hydrogen bonds between MXene sheets and cellulose fibers, the pristine cellulose fabric can be converted into a multifunctional MXene-coated cellulose fabric (M-fabric) by a facile dip-coating process.160 Based on its reversible humidity-sensitive response upon swelling/contraction of channels between the MXene interlayers induced by H2O, the wearable M-fabric was able to perceive shallow mouth breathing, deep mouth breathing, and nose breathing by detecting trace amounts of moisture (Fig. 11d). Besides, due to its stably quick electro-thermal response, the M-fabric could further be demonstrated for a wearable neck-guarding thermotherapy pad that could steadily generate heat for improving blood circulation, relieving pain, and reducing vertebrae cervical stiffness (Fig. 11e and f). More intriguingly, such multifunctional fabrics displayed water molecular extraction-induced electrical response upon heating (Fig. 11g), serving as a flexible wearable temperature alarm, which performed real-time temperature detection of a thermotherapy platform without the risk of low-temperature burns (Fig. 11h). To develop a durable and comfortable wearable capacitive sensor for continuously monitoring different human health statuses, a topographical modification method developed with genus-3 and genus-5 structures was used to design wearable sensors using cotton fabric as a biosubstrate, and nickel nanoparticles tightly and uniformly coated onto the cotton fibers by an electroless deposition process, forming a highly conductive interconnected network (Fig. 11i).161 The fabric-based capacitive sensor that presented flexibility, comfortability, and durability was integrated into tights to realize simultaneous detection of the relative capacitance variation with distance and angle variations between two fabric electrodes (Fig. 11j). When a person inhaled, the abdominal muscles relaxed, causing the abdomen to protrude, and the distance between the two conductive fabrics was shortened, thus generating inhalation signals (Fig. 11k). Additionally, the sensor was also capable of real-time detection of pronunciation, nictation, head movements, and joint movements. To further investigate the stability and durability of the sensor, resistance signals were recorded by the fabric-based capacitive sensor during the repeatable MCR-hand finger bending process (Fig. 11l). Electronic fabrics that feature well-controlled strain-sensitive capabilities and comfortable wearability have been attracting more and more attention with the increasing progress of wearable strain sensor systems. Fig. 11m illustrates a wearable cotton fabric-based strain sensor (CFSS) with an interpenetrating structure, which was fabricated via depositing graphene nanosheets onto a cotton fabric using multiple dipping processes and subsequently encapsulating the fabrics by polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS).162 A CFSS with flexible, outstanding sensing capability, low strain detection limit, high reliability, and excellent durability was demonstrated for an electronic fabric that recorded dynamic information in real time, such as joint movement (e.g., finger, wrist, and elbow bending), book folding, and ruler and smartphone speaker vibration (Fig. 11n and o).

3.3 Cellulose papers as biosubstrates for flexible wearable sensors
Paper-based sensors, as an appealing and vital kind of soft electronic device, are becoming a hot spot in industrial and academic research (Table 3).164–194 Paper made of cellulose is a commodity ubiquitous in our society, and the papermaking industry can produce it on a large scale and at low cost. Owing to its unique hierarchical porous structure and rough but absorbable surface performance, a variety of conductive materials (e.g., carbon, conducting polymer, and metal nanomaterials) can be easily combined with the paper structure, presenting superior accommodating ability. Commonly, paper can be functionalized through diverse techniques including coating (e.g., dip-coating, brush-coating, sputter coating and spray-coating), printing (screen-printing and inkjet printing), and pencil-drawing (Fig. 12a). As illustrated in Fig. 12b–d, Xu et al.164 directly drew graphite patterns on office-copy paper using a pencil to design an on-skin electronic device involving biophysical sensors (temperature sensor and electrophysiological sensor) and biochemical sensors (sweat sensor), which performed continuous capturing of a broad-range of significant bodily physiological signals, such as temperature, heart and respiratory rates, electrocardiograms (ECGs), electromyograms (EMGs), electroencephalogram (EEG), and pH, uric acid (UA) and glucose in sweat. In another example, the common printing paper was used as a supporting substrate that was firstly covered by a plastic mask and then sprayed with a CB/rGO dispersion to yield a sensitive layer with a hierarchical structure on the paper after drying (Fig. 12e).165 Because of the unique structure, the assembled flexible sensor demonstrated great sensitivity for strain/pressure, humidity, and temperature, which could detect body movements (e.g., finger touching and bending, elbow bending, and head nodding) and human exhalation and inspiration (Fig. 12e). Other than pencil-drawing and spray coating, printing technology also provides a facile, cost-saving sustainable, scalable pathway for constructing flexible wearable high-performance sensors. As depicted in Fig. 12f, by using the screen-printing technique and papers as supporting biosubstrates, Maier et al.166 developed a cost-effective and disposable paper-based electrochemical wearable sensor that was capable of continuous and real-time detection of exhaled H2O2 in artificial breath and was integrated into a commercial respirator for on-site testing of exhaled breath. Besides, the functionality of the paper electrochemical sensor was demonstrated by monitoring H2O2 in simulated respiration in a concentration-dependent manner in real time.

(i) Current signals sensed by the humidity sensor during the wetting process of baby diapers. (j) Current signals caused by finger spraying moisturizing water. 
Aside from recording vital biophysical and biochemical signals of the human body, capturing human surrounding environment signals (e.g., gas, humidity, and light) is of equal importance for our daily lives.164–194 For instance, Lee et al.167 integrated multiwalled CNTs and nanolayered TMDCs (transition metal dichalcogenides) on porous cellulose paper to construct a greatly sensitive and deformable chemical sensor (Fig. 12g). The cellulose paper as a supporting substrate endowed the paper chemical sensor with robust mechanical deformation (reversible 3D folding and unfolding, bending, and twisting to 1800°) and excellent sensing capability under crumpling. Meanwhile, the CNTs maintained a good percolation network and offered favorable gas reactivity. More attractively, after CNTs with a TMDC (WS2 or MoS2) coating, the paper chemical sensor not only substantially improved the sensing ability to NO2, but also accurately selectively monitored NO2 over different reduction streams. Humidity detection in the environment, which can provide significant information for our society, has also been widely studied. Fig. 12h depicts a multifunctional paper-based humidity sensor assembled using printing paper and flexible conducting tape via a convenient pasting approach, where the paper simultaneously functioned as a flexible supporting substrate and the sensing material.168 Benefiting from the mechanical flexibility and moderate hydrophilicity of the paper as well as the well-designed structure of the sensor, the paper-based humidity sensor showed not only excellent flexibility and biocompatibility but also high humidity-sensitivity with a reliable linearity (R2 = 0.9549) in a broad relative humidity sensing range from 41.1 to 91.5%, enabling it to achieve multifunctional applications in respiratory rate, baby diaper wetting, noncontact switch, human skin humidity, and spatial position monitoring (Fig. 12i and j).
Even though substantial progress has been achieved in paper-based sensors, it is still a challenge to prepare sensors that can fully utilize the unique merits of paper including cost efficiency, easy disposability, cuttability, and foldability. Gao et al.195 developed a flexible and wearable disposable all paper-based piezoresistive (APBP) pressure sensor using AgNW-coated tissue papers as sensing materials and NCP as a bottom biosubstrate for printing electrodes and an outer encapsulation layer via a simple, low-cost, and environment-friendly approach (Fig. 13a). The APBP pressure sensor demonstrated an excellent sensitivity of 1.5 kPa−1 within the pressure range from 0.03 to 30.2 kPa and still maintained stable and sensitive performance even under severe bending. Furthermore, the APBP sensor attached onto the human skin was able to record physiological signals (e.g., wrist pulse, sound, and finger contact) in real time and used as a soft electronic skin to sense the pressure by a small toy (Fig. 13b and c). More importantly, owing to the attributes of individual components, the pressure sensor displayed combined merits of outstanding mechanical properties (flexibility, folding, and crumpling), cost-saving, simple process, and quick fabrication and could be disposed of facilely by incineration. In another typical example, using highly conductive PPy/printing papers as electrodes and low-conductivity PPy-coated tissue papers as active layers, an all-paper, cuttable, and foldable pressure sensor was fabricated (Fig. 13d).196 The 2D or 3D all-paper sensor (such as 2D flower and 3D hat) was easily constructed by kirigami/origami because the sensor as a whole could be freely cut and folded, displaying the unique 2D and 3D perception ability in any position (Fig. 13e). The all-paper sensor presented great sensitivity (4.8 kPa−1 at <5.5 kPa, 1.7 kPa−1 at 5.5–40 kPa) with a broad pressure sensing range (up to 40 kPa), which was capable of capturing full-range biophysical and biochemical signals (such as throat pronunciation, breathing, wrist pulse, walking, running, jumping, and muscle) as well as external stimuli (such as different grounds) (Fig. 13f and g).

4. Cellulose-derived carbon materials for flexible wearable sensors
Cellulosic materials that can be transformed into electrically conductive carbonaceous materials with rationally designed morphologies and structures have been developed as active sensing elements for wearable sensors, which provide new opportunities for health and environment monitoring (Table 4).57,58,197–212 Nevertheless, pure cellulosic carbonaceous materials normally suffer from poor mechanical and electrochemical properties, which remain unsatisfactory for the practical application of wearable and portable sensors. Great efforts have been devoted to tailoring cellulosic carbonaceous material properties by hybridizing advanced functional materials, and remarkable progress has been achieved thus far. In this section, the microstructures of pure cellulosic carbonaceous materials and the recent advances in rational nano/microstructural design of cellulosic carbonaceous hybrid materials are presented in detail.

4.1 Cellulose fabric-derived macroscopic carbon for flexible wearable strain sensors
Flexible and wearable strain sensors, particularly piezoresistive strain sensors with structural design simplicity and facile fabrication process, demonstrate substantial potential applications in human motion monitoring and personalized healthcare systems.57,197 Ultrastretchable wearable strain sensors that possess both broad working strain range and great sensitivity have been developed by using commercial cellulose fabrics as precursors. By simply annealing the cotton fabric, flexible and high-conductivity carbonized plain weave cotton fabric (CPCF) was obtained, which further functioned as the sensing component for wearable strain sensors (Fig. 14a).57 Benefiting from the hierarchically conductive network structure of the CPCF, the flexible strain sensor presented outstanding sensing performance of wide working strain range (>140%), low detection limit of 0.02% strain, and excellent sensitivity (GF = 25 and 64 within 0–80% and 80–140% strain, respectively) (Fig. 14b). On the basis of its fascinating properties, its capability to sense full-range human motions included large-scale bodily joint motions (e.g., knee and finger joint bending) (Fig. 14c and d) and subtle motions (e.g., facial microexpressions, breath, wrist pulse, and speaking English words) (Fig. 14e–h), demonstrating its promising application in wearable devices. Notably, various fabric and hierarchical network structures of carbonized cellulose fabrics in wearable or skin-mountable strain sensors would produce various contact resistance-responses to external strain stimuli, resulting in various sensing properties. Namely, microstructures of active components in ultrastretchable wearable and skin-mountable strain sensors determine its sensing performance.

4.2 Cellulose paper-derived macroscopic carbon for flexible wearable strain and pressure sensors
Recent years have also witnessed the vigorous development of flexible resistive-type pressure sensors.58,198–206 Up to now, they still fail to achieve both superior sensitivity and large workable pressure range similar to the strain sensor. Constructing rational microstructures of active components in flexible pressure sensors is of fundamental importance for achieving high performance in sensing. Due to the development of fabrication techniques in paper processing and progress in research, cellulose paper has been engineered into rationally tunable microstructures to improve the sensitivity and working pressure range of flexible pressure sensors.58,198–206 Typically, a high-sensitivity flexible piezoresistive pressure sensor was integrated by using screen-printed interdigital electrodes on the flat printing paper as a substrate and a high-conductivity carbonized crepe paper (CCP) with a corrugated structure as an active element (Fig. 15a and b).198 Benefiting from the corrugated and porous structure of the CCP (Fig. 15b1), the CCP-based pressure sensor achieved fascinating sensing performance of great sensitivity (2.56–5.67 kPa−1 in pressure of 0–2.53 kPa), large response range of 0–20 kPa, fast response time (<30 ms), low detection limits (∼0.9 Pa), and high durability (>3000 cycles). Additionally, the multifunctional applications in monitoring human motions including wrist pulse, breath, and speaking English words (Fig. 15c–e) as well as external physical signals including music vibration, water droplets, and spatial pressure distribution (Fig. 15f–h) were demonstrated. Similarly, Chinese art paper (CAP) that consists of stacked cellulose fibers can be transformed into a high-conductivity paper with the graphitized structure by a simple carbonization process, while retaining its original integrity and mechanical flexibility (Fig. 15i).58 The conductive network structure of carbonized CAP (CCAP) holds great promise for designing high-performance sensors. For example, Xia et al.58 reported a highly sensitive wearable strain sensor based on carbonized commercially available CAP with a network structure composed of stacked carbonaceous fibers with diameters ranging from 10 to 30 μm (Fig. 15j), which exhibited excellent performance such as wide workable strain range of 0–120%, high sensitivity (GF = 68, and 248 in strain of 100% and 80–140%, respectively), ultralow detection limits (0.01% strain), and reliable durability. Based on its outstanding performance, the CCAP-based strain sensor could be not only pasted on the throat to monitor phonation (Fig. 15k and l), but also mounted on a human face to detect face microexpressions (e.g., smile) and eye movement (Fig. 15k, m, and n).

4.3 Cellulose-derived carbon aerogels for flexible wearable pressure sensors
Lightweight, compressible, and elastic carbon aerogels with 3D interconnected conductive network structures have been developed as fascinating sensing components in the design of high-performance pressure sensors.207–212,231 In one study, Chen et al.207 successfully prepared a wood-derived elastic and lightweight carbon aerogel with tracheid-like texture from cellulose nanofibers (CNFs) and lignin simply by a sustainable “bottom-up” strategy (Fig. 16a and b). This carbon aerogel demonstrated exotic mechanical properties of super compressibility of 95% strain, superelasticity and remarkable fatigue resistance as well as outstanding sensing performance with an extremely high sensitivity (S = 5.16 kPa−1), a wide linear range of working pressure (0–16.89 kPa), and accurate detection of biosignals. As depicted in Fig. 16c, the C-AL/CNF-5-based pressure sensor could capture signals from subtle arm pulse and phonation. The arm pulse was distinct and regular and three peaks could be identified clearly. Additionally, the sensor attached on the neck was capable of detecting the real-time current variation when reading the words “carbon” or “panda”. Other types of microstructures have also been constructed in carbon aerogels to fabricate pressure sensors with high-performance multifunctionality for health monitoring. For instance, a compressible and elastic carbon aerogel (CECA) with the parallelly and continuously wave-shaped lamellae structure was derived from 2D MXene (Ti3C2) nanosheets and bacterial cellulose (BC) by a three-step process of directional freeze, freeze-drying, and annealing.208 The extremely high flexibility, superior elasticity, and oriented alignment of these lamellae endowed the prepared CECA with outstanding mechanical properties of high compressibility and elasticity (Fig. 16d and e). Its super-stable lamellar structures that could undergo an exceptionally high stain of 99% for at least 100 cycles and long-term compression with 50% strain for up to 100000 cycles were also demonstrated (Fig. 16e). More importantly, the CECA possessed robust sensing performance with superhigh linearity sensitivity (S = 12.5 kPa−1), wide workable pressure range (0–10 kPa), and ultralow detection limits. Such characteristics allowed the CECA-based sensor to act as a high-performance wearable device to record full-range physiological signals such as tiny-scale motions (e.g., facial microexpressions) and vigorous motions (e.g., finger bending) (Fig. 16f).

As the demand for sensors that work without external power supply has increased for various flexible wearable applications including health and environment monitoring, triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs), as a sustainable power source for sensors, which can effectively convert mechanical energy into electrical energy on the basis of the coupling of triboelectrification and electrostatic induction have been continuously pursued.213–230 In particular, TENGs integrated with the human body can directly sense bodily actions by the generated electric signals, which present desirable combined merits of exceptionally high output and efficiency, versatile structural design, lightweight, compact size, mechanical robustness, and ultrahigh stability. At present, TENG-based self-powered sensors that utilize the ambient environmental energy to drive the operation themselves have made great progress in applications for various kinds of mechanical behaviors, healthcare and environment monitors, human-machine interfaces, and so forth (Table 5). This section will summarize the structural design and engineering in cellulose-derived materials for TENG-based self-powered sensors, such as pressure/strain sensors, temperature sensors, and humidity sensors. Piezoelectric nanogenerators (PENGs) are also briefly mentioned.

5.1 Fiber-based triboelectric nanogenerators for self-powered sensors
Cellulose can be shaped into several types of structures, such as 1D fibrous configuration. The fibrous structure shows unique combined advantages, including mechanical flexibility, ultrahigh conformability, lightweight and robust durability, making it ideally suitable for next-generation soft biointegrated electronic devices conformable to curved biological tissues/organs (e.g., human skin). Cellulose fibers, as a typical class of natural fibers, can be converted into a variety of cellulose assemblies, involving yarns, paper, fabrics and textile, which provide appealing platforms for applications in intelligent fibers, multifunctional papers, smart fabrics, and self-powered biophysical and biochemical sensors.213–230 For example, a self-powered fiber-based generator (FBG) was presented through coating CNT-coated cotton threads with polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) (Fig. 17a).213 The surface of the cotton thread was fully covered by CNTs (Fig. 17a1) and the as-fabricated PCCT showed a core–shell-structured character (Fig. 17a2). Then, an ultralight and flexible FBG with a curved shape constructed by CNT and GO intertwined was knitted into fabric (Fig. 17a3 and a4). Using the FBG, self-powered finger-motion state sensing was demonstrated (Fig. 17b). Besides, the “power shirt” could charge a 2.2 μF commercial capacitor (Fig. 17c). More attractively, this “power shirt” was able to drive the wireless bodily temperature monitor system to sense the surrounding environment temperature where the wristband was fixed on the human wrist (Fig. 17d and e). Similarly, He et al.214 demonstrated a self-powered flexible cellulose fiber-based triboelectric nanogenerator (cf-TENG) (Fig. 17f3) via a facile and low-cost strategy by incorporating 1D CMFs/CNFs into 2D CMFs/CNFs/Ag hierarchical nanostructure (Fig. 17f). Benefiting from its desirable highly porous nanostructure (Fig. 17f2) and distinctive power generation function (Fig. 17h), the flexible cf-TENG system (Fig. 17g) was capable of real-time monitoring and efficient removal of PM2.5 with an efficiency of 98.83% and detecting respiratory state without an external power supply (Fig. 17i and j).

5.2 Paper-based piezoelectric nanogenerators and triboelectric nanogenerators for self-powered sensors
The sensitivity and stretchability of cellulose composite paper-based self-powered sensors were effectively controlled by rationally designing the structure and adjusting the connection channels.217,218,226–230 For instance, Zhang et al.217 successfully developed a composite piezo-electric paper by in situ assembly of vanadium-doped ZnO (V-ZnO) mircoflowers in BC matrices (Fig. 18a and b). Mircoflowers were uniformly incorporated into the BC film (Fig. 18b1 and b2). The V-ZnO/BC composite paper-based piezoelectric nanogenerator (PENG) showed superior flexibility and excellent output performance by virtue of the ferroelectric properties of the incorporated V-ZnO (Fig. 18d and e). Moreover, the PENGs based on the V-ZnO/BC composite paper were able to function as self-powered body movement sensors that could monitor page turning action when integrated with book pages (Fig. 18c and f). On the other hand, Zhang et al.218 designed a CNF-based gear-like TENG (Fig. 18g) through utilizing cellulose-based triboelectric materials based on surface amino modification and Ag NP-coated CNFs (Fig. 18g1). TENGs with varying quantities of gear-like structures were constructed to investigate the effect of the amount of gears on their output performance (Fig. 18h). The CNF-based TENG with three pairs of gear-like structures demonstrated excellent flexibility and integrability as well as the maximum open-circuit voltage of 286 V and the maximum power density of 0.43 W m−2, which was capable of driving 60 LEDs (Fig. 18i). More importantly, the TENG-based self-powered sensor that displayed superior sensitivity and responsiveness was able to sense finger touching and releasing because the 3D space structure increased the frictional contact area (Fig. 18j–l).

Despite the substantial improvement achieved in cellulose paper-TENGs for self-powered sensors, developing inexpensive, ultralight, sustainable, flexible and wearable high-performance sensor systems with miniaturized integration and function for health and environment monitoring is an ongoing challenge. Herein, Sriphan et al.219 demonstrated a facile dip coating method to develop a multifunctional cellulose filter paper (CFP)-based TENG derived from dielectric Ti0.8O2 nanosheets (Ti0.8O2 NSs) and conductive Ag NPs (Fig. 19b and c). Introducing three layers of dielectric Ti0.8O2 NSs onto the CFP could substantially improve the generation of charges and the addition of 5 layers of Ag NPs could provide a conductive path for charge transfer (Fig. 19a). Such features not only endowed the CFP-based TENG with an output voltage of ≈42 V and a current density of ≈1 μA cm−2 as well as the power density of ≈25 μW cm−2, but also enabled the CFP-based TENG to light up 40 LEDs and charge a 0.22 μF capacitor to 8 V in only 5 s (Fig. 19d). More interestingly, the CFP-based TENG was able to capture biophysical signals, such as finger tapping, finger rubbing, and foot trampling (Fig. 19e). As another important example of paper-based self-powered sensors, paper was utilized as a lightweight, inexpensive, and flexible supporting substrate to develop cost-effective, eco-friendly, sustainable and efficient energy sources for healthcare and environment monitoring. A novel flexible self-charging triboelectric power cell (STPC) was constructed from MoS2, non-conductive glue, graphite powder, and plain paper (Fig. 19f).220 Fascinatingly, the STPC presented exceptional output performance of open circuit voltage (Voc) (∼3.82 V) and short circuit current (∼0.20 μA) as well as the maximum power (∼0.67 μW), which was of high-sensitivity and demonstrated linear response to temperature (T) and weight (W) (Fig. 19g and h).

More recently, all paper-based self-powered sensors also have attracted extensive research interest in health and environment monitoring due to their excellent flexibility, light weight, easy fabrication, low cost, and environment-friendliness.221,222 For instance, Chen et al.221 reported a simple and efficient method to fabricate an all-paper-based TENG (P-TENG) using flat print paper as the substrate and corrugated crepe cellulose paper (CCP) paired with a porous nitrocellulose membrane (NCM) as the friction layers (Fig. 20a). The P-TENG yielded excellent triboelectric performance (an output voltage of 196.8 V) and a current (31.5 μA) with a power density (16.1 W m−2) because CCP and NCM had very different tribopolarities and microstructures (Fig. 20a). Additionally, the P-TENGs, as a durable self-powered sensor, could detect bodily movement such as finger touching (Fig. 20b) and a keyboard based on an array of P-TENGs was capable of achieving self-powering, real-time communication between a Paper Piano and a computer (Fig. 20c). To develop a flexible electrode with combined merits including low cost, disposability, and easy preparation, and environment-friendliness, Liu et al.222 demonstrated an ionogel-infiltrated paper-based flexible electrode (IIPFE) (Fig. 20f) with a flat and smooth surface (Fig. 20g2) and a PDMS/hexane-modified paper with a rough surface (Fig. 20g1), which were used to fabricate flexible all-paper-based force sensors (Fig. 20h). Besides, the highly sensitive passive mode piezoresistive sensor based on IIPFE could detect dynamic and static pressure (Fig. 20d), and the all-paper-based flexible self-powered sensor with a structure of triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) had a linear sensitivity (20.6 mV N−1) in detecting impact force (Fig. 20e).

5.3 Aerogel-based triboelectric nanogenerators for self-powered sensors
Cellulose-based aerogel with a 3D interconnected porous network structure has been designed to prepare highly stretchable triboelectric nanogenerators for self-powered sensors.223–225 For example, Zhang et al.223 developed a new approach to fabricate cellulose-based aerogels that were used to construct TENGs for energy harvesting and self-powered sensing. A dissolution–regeneration process was demonstrated to prepare cellulose II aerogels in a green lithium bromide trihydrate solvent (Fig. 21a). The as-prepared cellulose II aerogel consisting of an interconnected porous flexible network showed excellent mechanical flexibility, high porosity, and a large surface area (Fig. 21b). Such architectural merits endowed the cellulose II aerogel-based TENG with a superior sensitivity and exceptional triboelectric output. More attractively, the cellulose II aerogel-based TENG was demonstrated for lighting up LEDs (Fig. 21c) and real-time detection of human motions including walking or running (Fig. 21d–f). To further improve the performance of TENGs, continuous efforts are needed to find novel methods. For instance, Mi et al.224 developed a high-performance flexible TENG derived from porous CNF/polyethylenimine (PEI) aerogel paired with multiple layers of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) nanofiber mats, which showed excellent triboelectric output performance (a maximum output power density of 13.3 W m−2) and outstanding mechanical properties. Furthermore, the high-sensitivity self-powered sensor based on the TENG was capable of real-time and continuous detection of large bodily motion such as arm bending and footprints and weak force such as finger tap and water drip (Fig. 21g). In another example, an all-printed approach was introduced to develop advanced 3D hierarchically structured cellulose aerogel based TENGs for multifunctional self-powered sensors (Fig. 21h).225 The AP-TENG exhibited extraordinary triboelectric performance (fast response and high voltage output) because the 3D micro/nano hierarchically patterned structure (Fig. 21h1) and the nano-porous aerogel structure (Fig. 21h2) in the all-printed triboelectric nanogenerator (AP-TENG) could substantially improve the effective utilization of the structure and were conducive to the contact area, surface roughness and mechanical elasticity of the device. Importantly, the AP-TENG was demonstrated for an efficient energy-harvesting device and the self-powered mechanical sensor and humidity sensor for powering 88 LEDs (Fig. 21i) and real-time and continuous detection of human motion (e.g., hand and leg movements) (Fig. 21j) and ambient humidity (Fig. 21k and l).

6. Conclusions and perspectives
Stretchable, skin-mountable, foldable, and flexible wearable sensors are of fundamental importance for soft electronics, which have gained a broad range of applications in shape-conforming systems for E-skins, human-computer interface, personal healthcare and surrounding environment monitoring. Owing to the intriguing characteristics of easy processability, sustainable production on a large scale, mechanical flexibility and robustness, desirable biocompatibility, programmable/controllable biodegradability, and polynary electrical properties, cellulose has been developed as a biosubstrate for flexible wearable sensors, including biophysical sensors, biochemical sensors, and environmental monitoring sensors. With the revolutionary progress of fabrication techniques in material processing and great progress in research, cellulose has been made into a variety of advanced multidimensional materials (1D: fibers, nanofibers, and yarns, 2D: papers, films, and fabrics, and 3D: gels, foams, and sponges) with tailorable structures and desired functionalities. Meanwhile, cellulose can be transformed into electrically conductive carbon materials with rationally designed morphologies and structures, which are emerging as a promising materials platform for sensing-related devices.
Regardless of the exciting advancements in cellulose-derived materials for flexible wearable sensors, continuous efforts are needed to overcome the following challenges: (I) though cellulose has been attractive as a biocompatible materials platform (biosubstrates, sensing layers, and triboelectric layers) for multifunctional sensors, other indispensable functional components including metallic or semiconducting materials and conducting conjugated polymers impose restrictions on the biocompatibility of implantable and epidermal sensors. Similarly, cellulose- derived carbon materials as active components are commonly integrated with less-biocompatible elastic polymers (e.g., PDMS) for the design of flexible sensors, which severely limits the application of biocompatibility and implantability. (II) In-depth basic research on element replacement, chemical modification, self-assembly at the molecular level, hybridization, and structural design is highly desired to endow cellulose-derived materials with well-designed morphologies and structures (e.g., porous, arched, honeycomb, and anisotropic structures) as well as unique functions of desirable ion and electron conductivities along with stretchability and integrability with soft and curved biological tissues/organs. (III) Most of the current cellulose-based sensors still suffer from single function and multifunctional integration is highly desired. Unique functional characteristics including self-powering, wireless-sensing, self-sensing, self-healing, self-cleaning, breathability and biodegradability are needed to broaden the current application range of cellulose-based flexible sensors. Additionally, since a specific sensor must respond to multiple stimuli at the same time, it is difficult to distinguish the type and intensity of each stimulus. Nature itself is a great inspiration for realizing functions. For instance, human skin possesses unique combined features of self-healable capabilities and monitoring and perceiving multiple stimuli (e.g., such as pressure, strains and temperature). Skin-like sensors that mimic known functions (such as perceptive and self-healing functions) and the hierarchical structure of human skin can exhibit self-healable abilities and multiple sensations to complex deformation, which are desired for the development of personalized healthcare and environment monitors. (IV) It is hard to achieve all performance metrics including sensitivity, stretchability, linearity, hysteresis, reliability and response/recovery, in a specific sensing material. Owing to the restrictions on mechanical and electrical properties, a trade-off relationship generally exists between high sensitivity and high stretchability for the strain sensor, limiting the practical application in sensing full-range human activities. Simultaneously realizing a broad workable range for high sensitivity and a broad linear region for high stretchability is an ongoing challenge for cellulose-based strain and pressure sensors. Constructing hierarchical multiscale sensing structures around the highly localized strains is a feasible approach to balance the sensitivity and stretchability.
As mentioned earlier, it is of great importance for the construction of high-performance and multifunctional flexible and wearable sensors toward bodily health and surrounding environment monitoring based on fundamental research and exploration as well as processing–structure–property–application relationships of cellulose-derived materials. Meanwhile, the future development of cellulose-derived materials for sensors will be mostly focused on the following aspects: (I) the construction of hierarchical multiscale microstructures (e.g., honeycomb structure and anisotropic structure) within cellulose-derived materials on the basis of fundamental research and advanced processing technology. (II) Given the inherent attributes of cellulose and the functions of nature itself, skin-like biocompatible and implantable wearable bioelectronics with desirable mechanical properties (e.g., high flexibility, high stretchability, and wearability), exceptional sensing capabilities (e.g., high sensitivity, a wide workable range, and high durability) and reliable self-healing abilities show great promise for personalized disease treatment, health maintenance, and assistance in tissue and organ repair. (III) Developing advanced processing techniques to construct next-generation novel electronic devices that integrate multiple functions, such as power generation (TENGs and PENGs), solar power, energy storage, wireless technology, and sensing/actuating abilities. (IV) Stretchable and transparent cellulose hydrogels with mechanical performance and perceptive functions similar to those of human skin are capable of transmitting high-frequency electrical signals over long distances. In the future, innovative concepts and technologies are desired to incorporate novel functional components or structural motifs into cellulose hydrogel networks, which will endow the new generation of biocompatible cellulose composite hydrogels with excellent properties of desired ionic conductivity, structural flexibility, self-adhesion, and efficient and stable contact interfaces for implantable and biocompatible electronics. (V) Commercially available cellulose papers and cotton fabrics with exceptional mechanical properties and unique structures combined with advanced functional materials and material processing technologies show great prospects in large-scale sustainable production of multifunctional devices such as wireless self-powered sensors, flexible wearable energy storage devices, and disposable point-of-care (POC) devices, and so forth. (VI) The combination of cellulose materials and 3D-printed technology for the large-scale construction of cellulose-based functional materials with well-controlled morphologies and structures and tailorable physiochemical properties will play a key role in a variety of fields ranging from sensing and energy to medicine. (VII) Bioactive components introduced into a cellulose matrix can be studied for wearable drugs and cell delivery systems on the basis of wearable drugs and cell delivery systems.
In conclusion, since the first introduction of cellulosic active electrodes for sensors in 2012,232 researchers have invested tremendous and continuous efforts to explore the multifunctionalities and potentials of cellulose for the construction of high-performance sensors. Particularly in recent years, substantial advancements have been achieved in cellulose-based sensors, but it is still in the growing stage. In the short term, cellulose-based macrofibers, papers and fabrics have become a promising choice for low-cost, biocompatible, and high-performance flexible wearable sensors. Cellulose-derived material design with well-controlled morphologies and structures as well as tailorable physiochemical properties are a robust and promising direction to achieve the exceptional sensing capabilities and multifunctionalities on sensing devices for practical applications. We believe that this review can provide some fundamental insights for the scientific community engaged in research on cellulose-based sensors to understand common challenges and opportunities in depth, achieving more breakthroughs in terms of basic mechanisms, novel design methods, favorable structures, exciting performance, and even a large-scale integrated system for cellulose-based sensors.
