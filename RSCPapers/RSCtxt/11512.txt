    , Accepted 2nd September 2021First published on 3rd September 2021AbstractSolution processed perovskite photodetectors have attracted extensive interest in recent years. For future commercialization, highly efficient and stable devices need to be realized. Herein, we demonstrate that by introducing low-cost polystyrene microspheres as light scattering media in a p–i–n perovskite photodetector, enhanced photoelectric conversion rate can be obtained. Based on Mie scattering theory, a theoretical design was firstly executed to calculate the optimized microsphere size and then applied to the fabrication of the detector. After embedding microspheres, the high photocurrent and responsivity under 760 nm incident light illumination (light intensity P = 1.0 mW cm−2) reached 19.05 μA and 0.32 A W−1, respectively, which were nearly twice enhancements in comparison with the pristine device. Similarly, the improvement of detector performance response to 530 nm incident light was observed for the polystyrene microsphere embedded device. The maximum responsivity up to 0.45 A W−1 (P = 1.0 mW cm−2) and on/off ratio up to 104 were achieved. This work provides an effective design and implementation strategy to improve responsivity to specific light illumination for perovskite photodetectors.
Introduction
Due to the excellent optical and electronic properties, such as broad optical absorption spectrum, tunable optical band gap, long carrier diffusion lifetime and length, high carrier mobility, low exciton binding energies and facile manufacturing technique, metal halide perovskite materials have triggered an enormous storm of research in the past 12 years.1–6 Such merits endow them with wide application prospects in photoelectronic devices, including solar cells, light-emitting diodes, lasers, detectors, photocatalysis, sensors and so on.
Among the devices mentioned above, UV-visible photodetectors (PDs), converting optical signals into electrical signals, are important units in multicolor light detection, sensors, biomedical imaging, space exploration and others, which have a significant impact on our daily life.7–9 To realize highly efficient PDs, the following parameters should be synthetically considered, such as high external quantum efficiency (EQE), photocurrent, responsivity (R), detectivity (D*) and on/off ratio, fast response time, low dark current density and noise current.10–13
In 2014, photodetectors based on organic–inorganic perovskite were reported for the first time.14,15 From then on, many researchers have devoted themselves to the rapid development of perovskite PDs. The device structure of perovskite PDs can be generally classified into photoconductors, photodiodes and phototransistors. In order to obtain high-performance photodetectors, the strategies based on electronic and optical manipulations have been mainly investigated.16 Detection performances can be efficiently enhanced through optical manipulation. For example, Zeng et al. used Au nanocrystals for localized surface plasmon resonance in a CsPbBr3 based photodetector and 238% plasmonic enhancement factor was observed. Similarly, Au nanorods, Ag nanoparticles, and Ag or Al/anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) hybrid nanostructures were also demonstrated to realize plasmonic optical enhancement for perovskite photodetectors.17–19 Song and coworkers improved the detectivity of a CsPbCl3 based device through incorporating Ag film/polymethyl metharcylate (PMMA) opal photonic crystals, which combined the metal surface plasmon effect and photonic crystal effect.20 Chen et al. reported a perovskite color light detector with a Ag/ITO/Ag/ITO/Ag/ITO/Ag three-resonant cavity to improve the color purity.21 In addition, several groups have integrated optical waveguides into perovskite detectors to enhance light absorption.22
As the photon harvesting ability of the perovskite film is of great importance to the improvement of photodetector performances, we were inspired by the above investigations of optical manipulations. Herein, in this work, a well-designed light scattering structure is used to improve photon harvesting of the p–i–n perovskite photodiode photodetector via altering the optical path length, thus resulting in highly enhanced optoelectronic performances. The photodiode detector with p–n, p–i–n or Schottky junction exhibits fast response time, low dark current and high carrier separation efficiency under the conditions of low energy consumption. The vertical structure is similar to a photovoltaic device and usually defined as a kind of self-powered photodetector.23–25 This is the main reason why we choose a p–i–n type device as our research object.
By introducing well-dispersed and low-cost polystyrene (PS) microspheres with an average diameter of 300 nm into the CH3NH3PbI3 film, higher photon absorption at the specific incident light range, especially at λ = 760 nm, is achieved. Such result can be directly reflected in the variation of device photocurrent, which is a nearly twice promotion in the PS microsphere embedded detector under 760 nm incident light irradiation. The corresponding values of responsivity and detectivity are 0.32 A W−1 and 3.5 × 1012 cm Hz−1/2 W−1 at light intensity of 1.0 mW cm−2. Additionally, obvious improvement in device performance is also obtained under 530 nm light illumination by introducing PS microspheres. Theoretical simulation verifies the extraordinarily enhanced photon harvesting ability of such structures at specific wavelengths of 530 nm and 760 nm, which can be attributed to the light scattering caused by PS microspheres. Our results demonstrate a simple but effective route to improve the performance of perovskite PDs, which might also be extended to the development of a variety of PDs.
Results and discussion
As is well-known, light scattering is defined as the redirection of the optical propagation path when light encounters obstacles. Based on this theory, we designed to embed sphere particles with suitable sizes into the perovskite film, aiming to promote the light harvesting of the perovskite absorber through reducing the light transmission loss. As seen in Fig. 1(a), the microspheres can change the incident light travelling distance and then more photons can be captured and interacted with perovskite molecules, as compared to the pristine film. To reduce the complexity of the system, we chose electrical-neutral and well-dispersed polystyrene microspheres as the light scatting media. Fig. 1(b) is the simulated energy flow distribution in the vicinity of a doping unit that was calculated by the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method.26 A linearly polarized plane wave illuminates the device from the bottom at normal incidence. The refractive indexes of FTO, NiO, CH3NH3PbI3 and polystyrene are 1.8,27 2.182,28 2.625,29 and 1.530 respectively. The complex permittivity value of the silver electrode is taken from those reported by Johnson and Christy.31 The energy flow goes straightly up and down in the absence of the PS microspheres, resulting in limited photon harvesting, as shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). When the PS microspheres with proper sizes are embedded into the perovskite layer, incident photons vertical to the device surface will be scattered and flow in the horizontal direction. According to Mie scattering theory, when the particle size is comparable to the incident wavelength, the larger the particle, the more obvious the scattering effect.32 So once the thickness of CH3NH3PbI3 film is fixed, the embedding particles should be as large as possible. We firstly compared the calculation results of three sizes of microspheres (200 nm, 300 nm and 400 nm) embedded in the CH3NH3PbI3 layers with equal thicknesses. Fig. S2 (ESI†) gives the schematic diagram for simulation experiments. We set a monitor at the back of the incident light source, and the reflectance obtained from it can represent how many photons escape from the system, and “1-reflectance” shows the number of photons harvested in the system, as shown in Fig. S3(a) (ESI†). In fact, the thickness of CH3NH3PbI3 film in this work is estimated to be approximately 300 nm, which gives consideration to the fabrication technology and device overall performance. Based on this, we then compared the calculation results of three sizes of microspheres (100 nm, 200 nm and 300 nm) embedded in the CH3NH3PbI3 film with the thickness of 300 nm. The light scattering effect of the PS microsphere with its diameter of 300 nm is obvious, and it exhibits the highest enhanced light harvesting, as shown in Fig. S3(b) (ESI†). Additionally, the system of CH3NH3PbI3 (300 nm thickness)/PS (300 nm diameter) exhibits comparable photon harvesting in the range of 530–560 nm and 700–780 nm as seen in Fig. S3(a) (ESI†). In this demonstration, the incidence wavelength and the intensity is normalized according to the energy flow intensity of the pristine perovskite film. The energy flow in the horizontal direction dramatically increases the optical path where the interaction between photons and perovskite materials occurs, thus the photoelectric conversion rate is enhanced. It can be clearly seen from Fig. 1(b) that a portion of the energy flow is bent after scattering by the particle, and a part of the vector even converts to waveguide modes and localized optical vortices in the interlayer. Through parameter optimization, we found the best match which makes the spectral band with the best photon harvesting move to that of perovskite's optimum response.

Under the guidance of the above theoretical design, we fabricated the p–i–n perovskite photodetector with and without embedding PS microspheres. Fig. 2(a) illustrates the device structure of fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) anode/nickel oxide (NiO)/PS microsphere embedded CH3NH3PbI3/[6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM)/lithium fluoride (LiF)/silver (Ag) cathode. The CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite layer is used as the light absorber. The photo-induced holes and electrons are extracted through the NiO hole transfer layer and PCBM electron transport layer, respectively. Fig. 2(b) describes the energy level diagram of the device. PS microspheres with an average diameter of 300 nm were embedded in the perovskite film and the corresponding surface morphology shown in Fig. 2(c) and (d) was measured by using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). It is worth noting that the microspheres are sparsely dispersed in the film without aggregation, while the uniformity and compactness of the perovskite film are not affected. Additionally, the corresponding crystalline phase purity is evident, as shown in the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern (Fig. S4, ESI†). Therefore, the scattering capacity of the PS microspheres can be optimized, and meanwhile the carrier extraction performance of the perovskite film cannot be hampered.

(c) Spectral responsivity of the two types of devices. (d) Enhanced light harvesting spectrum for the PS microsphere embedded device from simulation (the inset is the experimental SR difference value). 
EQE exhibits the ability of converting the incident photons into carriers in varied wavelength. As is illustrated in Fig. 3(a), we can see that the EQE values for the sample with 300 nm PS microspheres range from 13.4% to 60.7% in the wavelength region of 360–780 nm. There are obvious enhancements in the two regions of 500–600 nm and 740–780 nm, as marked in dashed lines. In particular, at the position of 760 nm, the maximum EQE value of the embedded sample increased about 65% compared with the pristine device. For better understanding, the EQE difference of the two devices is shown in the inset of Fig. 3(a). In addition, the decline phenomenon can be observed in the range of 620–720 nm wavelength. It may be attributed to the light absorption loss caused by the space occupation of microspheres in the perovskite film and the effect of light scattering can not make up the loss. In order to further explain such results, we calculated the electric field distribution (E2) around the embedding unit in the entire device of FTO/NiO/PS microsphere/CH3NH3PbI3/PCBM/LiF/Ag, and Fig. 3(b) shows the results. The multilayer structure itself has selective localization for different wavelengths of incident light, and the field intensity corresponds to the photon number density, which is directly related to the photoelectric conversion. It can be seen that the photoelectric conversion rate is lower for the wavelength with smaller field intensity in the perovskite layer, while the wavelength with higher photoelectric conversion has larger near-field. Spectral photoresponse is another key figure-of-merit for photodetectors and the corresponding result is shown in Fig. 3(c). The wavelength dependent spectral responsivity (SR) has similar variation tendency to the EQE. The SR intensity improved from 0.14 A W−1 to 0.24 A W−1 at 760 nm after using PS microsphere embedding. In order to extract the role of PS microspheres, we calculated the optical transmission of the PS embedded device, and deducted the corresponding result when it was not embedded with microspheres. In the experiment, we also obtained two sets of data with or without PS microspheres, and obtained the SR difference value from them. As shown in Fig. 3(d), the trend of the predicted results from the theoretical calculations is basically consistent with the experimental results in the frequency domain. The yellow column in Fig. 3(d) is the weighted results considering the different photoelectric conversion efficiencies of perovskite materials at different wavelengths (447 nm, 530 nm, 680 nm and 760 nm are the detecting wavelengths that can be realized in our current experimental equipment). The weighted photon harvesting ability exhibits sharp improvements at 530 nm and 760 nm, which is in good agreement with the SR difference. Due to limited sampling, we only weighted a limited number of discrete data points. It can be predicted that the theoretical results will be more similar to the experimental results if the whole band is weighted. Through the matching of different thicknesses of each layer, as well as the comparison and optimization of different sizes of embedding microspheres, we finally find the suitable structure for the cascaded enhancement that renders the light harvesting in line with perovskite's photocurrent efficiency.
The light power dependent photocurrent under zero bias was measured to evaluate the detector performance under 760 nm light illumination. As can be seen in Fig. 4(a), the current increased linearly along with increasing light intensity from 0 to 1.0 mW cm−2. The photocurrent of the PS embedded device (19.05 μA) is nearly twice higher than the pristine one (10.69 μA) under 1.0 mW cm−2 light power. In addition, the variation of photocurrent under high incident light intensity (from 0 to 16 mW cm−2) is shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†). Considering the above simulation results, the photocurrent enhancement is reasonably attributed to the promoted photon harvesting ability of the 300 nm PS microsphere embedded perovskite film, resulting from its localized light scattering characteristics. Reponsivity (R) and detectivity (D*) are another two important parameters for PDs. R represents the ratio of photo-generated current to input light power. It can be calculated according to eqn (1). Here Ilight and Idark represent the photocurrent and dark current, respectively. P is the incident light power, and A is the device active area (the area in this work is 0.06 cm2). The variation of R along with incident light intensity is exhibited in Fig. 4(b). We can find that the value of R enhances from 0.18 A W−1 to 0.32 A W−1 after the insertion of PS microspheres at the light intensity (λ = 760 nm) of 1.0 mW cm−2. (1)The specific D* is defined as the sensitivity and anti-noise ability of a photodetector. It can be calculated from the following eqn (2): (2)where f is the electrical bandwidth and inoise is the noise current. The noise current signal by switching frequency is shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†). The average noise level of the two devices is 10−13 A Hz−1/2 along the change of frequency from 10 to 50 Hz. The corresponding D* of the PS embedded device is estimated to be 3.5 × 1012 cm Hz−1/2 W−1 or Jones (f = 20 Hz). The on/off ratio (Ilight/Idark) means the ratio of photocurrent and dark current which is mainly affected by the photoelectric conversion and charge transport in the active layer. As shown in Fig. 4(c) and Table 1, the highest on/off ratio of the embedded device can reach 3.66 × 102 and 6.4 × 103 at 1 and 16 mW cm−2, respectively. Linear dynamic range (LDR) represents the linear association range between light current and incident light intensity, which can be obtained by using eqn (3): (3)where  is the light current measured under the incident light intensity of 1.0 mW cm−2. Then we can calculate the LDR value of 53.7 dB and 50.1 dB for devices with and without PS microspheres, respectively. Furthermore, response time is also a key parameter to determine the PD performance which should be fast enough to follow the change speed of the incident light signal. It usually includes the rise time (Trise) and decay time (Tfall) which are identified as the time required for the current increasing from 10% to 90% and decreasing from 90% to 10% of the maximum values, respectively. Fig. 4(d) exhibits the I–t curves under the repetitive switch of 0.1 mW cm−2 incident light power at zero bias voltage. Additionally, the time–response curves for the PS microsphere embedded device under different light powers are presented in Fig. 4(e). There is no significant variation in the signal amplitude during the on/off cycles, thus indicating good reversibility and stability of the device. The response time of the two devices is shown in Fig. 4(f) and (g). A rise time of 23.2 μs and a fall time of 17.5 μs are obtained from the PS microsphere embedded device. While for the pristine device, the corresponding Trise and Tfall are determined to be 22.9 μs and 19.6 μs. It is noteworthy that the response time of both devices is approximately equal. So we can presume that the charge transfer process was not affected after the introduction of microspheres.

Additionally, we also evaluated the detector performances response to 530 nm visible light and the corresponding results are illustrated in Fig. 5 and Table 1. The photocurrent increased linearly as the incident light power P increased from 0 to 1.0 mW cm−2 as the number of photogenerated carriers is proportional to the absorbed photon flux. The photocurrent (P = 1.0 mW cm−2) is about 22.21 μA of the pristine device, while the value is improved to 26.95 μA after the insertion of PS microspheres. Then we can obtain the responsivity of 0.37 A W−1 and 0.45 A W−1 at P = 1.0 mW cm−2 light illumination for the pristine and PS microspheres embedded devices, respectively. The higher responsivity to 530 nm light illumination than 760 nm is mainly attributed to higher photon number density, as demonstrated in the above EQE result and electric field distribution. LDR acquired through eqn (3) for the microsphere embedded device is slightly higher than the pristine device and the highest value is 56.7 dB for the perovskite/PS microsphere device. The highest on/off ratio of the embedded device can reach 6.87 × 102 and 1.0 × 104 at 1 and 16 mW cm−2, respectively, as shown in Fig. 5(c) and Table 1. The comparison of light response under 0.1 mW cm−2 is shown in Fig. S7 (ESI†) and the photocurrent of all the devices keeps constant during the 30th repeating on–off switching cycles. Moreover, the time-dependent on/off photoswitching test with different incident light power of 0.1, 1, 2, 5 and 10 mW cm−2 for a PS embedded device is expressed in Fig. 5(d), which shows excellent photocurrent and stability under any light intensity conditions. For the pristine device, the response time (rise time Trise and decay time Tfall) can be estimated to be <10 μs (as seen in Table 1). Although the change tendency of response time is irregular for the microsphere embedded device, both the two values maintain the same order of magnitude, thus once again proving that the process of charge carrier generation and transfer was not affected by PS microspheres.

Experimental methods
Materials
FTO glass substrates were acquired from Huite Optoelectronic Technology Co., Ltd. Nickel acetate (Ni(CH3COO)2·H2O, AR) and glacial acetic acid (CH3COOH, 99.7%) were purchased from Shanghai Aladdin Bio-Chem Technology Co., Ltd. PbI2 (99%), CH3NH3I (99.5%), PCBM and LiF were obtained from Xi’an Polymer Light Technology Co., Ltd. PS microsphere (2.5% concentration) dispersed solution and chemical solvent were acquired from J&K Scientific, Ltd (China).
Device fabrication
FTO substrates were firstly cleaned sequentially with deionized water, acetone and isopropyl alcohol by using an ultrasonic cleaner. The substrates were treated by ultraviolet ozone for 30 min after blow-drying with nitrogen. A NiO layer was spin-coated onto an FTO substrate at 4000 rpm for 60 s from a 0.2 M precursor solution (mixture ratio of nickel acetate and glacial acetic acid) and baked at 300 °C for 30 min in a muffle furnace. Then PS microspheres with an average diameter of 300 nm were spin-coated from a diluted suspension liquid and dried in the air. For the preparation of a CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite layer, we followed and optimized the method of two-step spin coating that we previously reported.33 A PbI2 solution (462 mg ml−1 in DMF) was spun onto the substrate at 3000 rpm for 40 s and then a CH3NH3I (40 mg ml−1 in IPA) solution was spin-coated onto the as-prepared PbI2 layer at 3000 rpm for 40 s. After that, the sample was thermally annealed at 100 °C for 5 min. Subsequently, a PCBM layer was spin-coated onto the perovskite layer by using a 2 wt% solution in 1,2-dichlorobenzene. Finally, the LiF (1 nm) and Ag (200 nm) electrode were sequentially deposited by thermal evaporation, respectively.
Characterization
FDTD calculation was performed by using Lumerical FDTD solutions. The average thicknesses of the NiO, CH3NH3PbI3 and PCBM layers for the simulation experiment are approximately 50 nm, 300 nm and 25 nm, respectively. The surface morphology of the microspheres and perovskite films were investigated by using scanning electron microscopy (SEM, TESCAN CLARA). The X-ray diffraction measurement was performed by using an Empyrean X-ray diffractometer (PANalytical, Holland) with Cu Kα as the radiation source (k = 1.5406 Å, operating at 45 kV and 40 mA). The thickness of each layer was measured by using a step profile (Bruker, Germany). External quantum efficiency (EQE) and spectral responsivity (SR) were measured from a commercial EQE set-up (Newport, IQE 200B). The detector properties (I–V, response time, on–off cycles) were collected by using an electrochemical workstation integrated with photo electrochemistry test components (ZAHNER, Zennium and CIMPS-UP) and the light sources used in this project were 760 nm and 530 nm light-emitting diodes. The measurement of noise current was performed by using a low frequency noise analyzer (Bodawei, NC300). Al the device measurements were performed under ambient conditions.
Conclusions
In summary, we firstly calculated the simulated energy flow distribution through the FDTD method to estimate the light scattering effect by embedding PS microspheres in the CH3NH3PbI3 based photodetector. Subsequently, the optimized microsphere with an average diameter of 300 nm was chosen to verify the theoretical calculations in the photodetector device of FTO/NiO/CH3NH3PbI3/PCBM/LiF/Ag. As a result, EQE exhibits obvious enhancement in the regions of 500–600 nm and 740–780 nm for the embedded device. The maximal amplification of the EQE value is under 760 nm wavelength, which is approximate 65%. Then we investigated the detector performances under 760 nm incident light illumination. The photocurrent increased from 10.69 to 19.05 μA at the light intensity of 1.0 mW cm−2 compared to the pristine device. The corresponding R, D* and LDR values are 0.32 A W−1, 3.5 × 1012 cm Hz−1/2 W−1 and 53.7 dB, respectively. Additionally, the maximum photocurrent and responsivity boosted to 26.95 μA and 0.45 A W−1 under 530 nm incident light illumination (P = 1.0 mW cm−2), respectively, which is about 21% improvement for the PS embedded device. This work will provide a new method for improving the performances of the p–i–n perovskite photodetector through optical theoretical design and low-cost fabrication technology.
