    , Accepted 30th October 2017First published on 31st October 2017AbstractThe electronic structures of 206 carbonyls and methylene derivatives based on conjugated cyclic hydrocarbons are computationally studied in this work using theoretical methods of quantum chemistry. The singlet open-shell nature of the ground state and its influence on the low-lying excited states is analyzed for 90 carbonyl (quinone, Q), 90 methylene (quinone dimethide, QDM) and 26 carbonyl-methylene (quinone methide, QM) mixed derivatives in the pursuit of new promising candidates for singlet fission sensitizers. Non-negligible diradical character is observed for most of the studied molecules, which is mainly determined by the nature and the relative position of the substituting groups in the bare rings. In general, the methylene group enhances to a greater extent the diradical character and the following trend is observed: y0(QDM) > y0(QM) > y0(Q). This feature leads to a decrease in the energy of the S0 → S1 and, especially, the S0 → T1 transitions, facilitating the accomplishment of the singlet fission energetic conditions: 2T1–S1 ≤ 0 (C1) and 2T1–T2 < 0 (C2). For all the methylene derivatives, these transitions have π → π* character, while some carbonyl-containing molecules, in particular those with low diradical character, show transitions with n → π* character, due to the presence of the lone pairs of the oxygen atom. From the total set of 206 molecules analyzed, 10 molecules with intermediate diradical character may be considered as potential candidates to undergo singlet fission efficiently.
1 Introduction
During the last few decades, solar energy has been gaining acceptance as a clean and renewable alternative to the combustion of fossil fuels; nevertheless, it still represents a small fraction of the total energy generated and consumed. In order to replace traditional polluting fuels with solar energy technologies, it is essential to reduce the cost of photovoltaic devices and increase their conversion efficiency. Crystalline silicon has achieved a 25.6% efficiency,1 approaching the maximum theoretical limit for a single-junction solar cell, set as 32% by the Shockley–Queisser limit.2 In recent years, second and third generation solar cells based on organic3 or hybrid materials4 have been developed achieving promising efficiencies of conversion in research solar cells (22.1%).5 Amongst these technologies, organic-based solar cells are especially appealing due to their low manufacturing costs, mechanical properties and design capabilities, but their conversion efficiencies are still too low. Processes that can provide new paths to circumvent the energy loss are based either on the combination of two low-energy photons to generate a photon with suitable energy or, alternatively, by splitting a high-energy photon into two energetically adequate photons.
One of the main energy losses in solar cells results from the inability to harvest and efficiently convert high-energy solar photons into electricity. In order to mitigate these losses, several ideas have emerged based on the downconversion of short wavelength photons. In the case of organic materials, such a phenomenon is called singlet fission (SF).6 By definition, SF is a spin-allowed photophysical process in which one spin-singlet excited state splits into two triplet states, hence potentially generating two low-energy excitons per absorbed photon. Despite the growing interest and numerous experimental and theoretical efforts towards this phenomenon, the list of requirements has limited, so far, the number of efficient singlet fission compounds to only a few molecules such as tetracene,7 pentacene,8–10 hexacene11 and, more recently, copolymer structures based on strong intramolecular donor–acceptor interactions.12 In addition to the general requirements for solar cell sensitizers, such as good light-harvesting capabilities or photo-stability, singlet fission chromophores have to fulfill two energy conditions:6 (i) the energy of the first singlet excited state (S1) should be slightly higher than (or at least equal to) twice the energy of the first triplet state (T1), in such a way that the process is exoergic (or isoergic). If the process is exaggeratedly exoergic, the efficiency may be reduced due to energy loss by heating. (ii) The second triplet state (T2) must be higher in energy than twice the energy of the first triplet excited state (T1) in order to avoid no-fission decay into the triplet manifold. The deactivation channel into the quintuplet manifold is typically not considered, since the Q1 state in organic molecules is expected to lie at higher energies.
Currently, one of the most intense lines of research in the singlet fission field is the search for novel compounds with improved fission properties. In this direction, molecules with an intermediate diradical character have been proposed as one of the main classes of promising SF sensitizers,6,13–17 fundamentally due to their inherent small singlet–triplet gaps that help the fulfillment of the aforementioned requirements. Since the energies of the singlet and triplet states are related to the diradical character of the ground state, this characteristic is suggested as a useful guideline for the design of new efficient SF molecules.
In this work, we intend to explore new singlet diradicals in the pursuit of promising candidates for singlet fission sensitizers by means of theoretical chemistry models and computational approaches. To achieve this goal, we will start from a set of 90 conjugated cyclic carbonyls designed in a previous work,18 of which many proved to have an appreciable diradical character and a small singlet–triplet gap. Since it is known that the substitution of the carbonyl group (CO) with a methylene (CCH2) group leads to derivatives with a remarkable diradical character,19 we have also analyzed the corresponding 90 methylene derivatives, as well as 26 partially methylene-substituted carbonyls, denoted as quinone methides. In this set of 206 conjugated cyclic hydrocarbons, we have studied the diradical character and low-lying excited states, in particular the energy and the nature of the transition to the first singlet (S1) and triplet (T1) excited states. Besides, the second triplet (T2) and the first quintet (Q1) states have also been considered in order to evaluate the feasibility of undergoing an efficient singlet fission process. The knowledge achieved in this work will allow us to propose different compounds that may be useful for the experimental community as a first step towards new singlet fission materials.
2 Computational details
All geometry optimizations have been performed in the gas phase within Density Functional Theory (DFT)20,21 using the B3PW91 functional22–24 in combination with the 6-31+G(d) basis set.25 Harmonic vibrational frequencies were obtained at the same level of theory to confirm that all the structures were minima in the potential energy surfaces (no imaginary frequencies were found) and to evaluate the zero-point vibrational energy (ZPVE) and the thermal corrections to the Gibbs free energy (T = 298 K, 1 atm) in the harmonic oscillator approximation. Single-point calculations using the aug-cc-pVTZ basis set26 were carried out on the optimized structures to refine the electronic energy. This level of theory has been found to be accurate for the modeling of open-shell singlet diradicals.27 All these calculations have been carried out using the Gaussian 09 package.28
The singlet diradical character is estimated from the spin-projected unrestricted Hartree–Fock (PUHF) theory,29–31 using the aug-cc-pVTZ basis set, as: (1)where Ti is defined as the orbital overlap and is calculated using the occupation number (n) of the UHF natural orbitals: (2)
Thus, from these equations both the diradical (y0) and tetraradical (y1) character can be estimated. An index value of 1 indicates a perfect diradical (or tetraradical), while a value of 0 means a closed-shell singlet (no tetraradical character).
Time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT)32,33 calculations have been carried out using the M06-2X34 functional together with the 6-31G+(d,p) basis set. Additionally, in order to improve the description of the non-dynamic correlation effects, Spin–Flip TDDFT (SF-TDDFT)35 calculations have also been carried out with the BHandHLYP22,36 functional and the 6-31G+(d,p) basis set, using the Q-Chem package.37
3 Assessment of methods
In view of the size of some of the molecules and the number of systems considered in the present study, we do not attempt the systematic calculation of transition energies with highly correlated wavefunction-based methods and, instead, rely on energies within the TDDFT framework. Since the accuracy of the computed T1 and S1 relative energies is of vital importance for the outcome of this study, firstly we perform a preliminary study to investigate the reliability of different exchange–correlation functionals in the calculation of vertical transitions to the lowest triplet and singlet states in a set of linear acenes, from naphthalene to hexacene. Several reasons make acenes an ideal training set for this study: (i) structural and electronic similarities with the family of molecules to be studied, (ii) they contain a wide range of diradical characters that gradually increase with size, (iii) some of them, i.e. tetracene and pentacene, are archetypal examples of singlet fission chromophores, and (iv) the existence of highly accurate ab initio results for S1 and T1 energies to use as a reference. Amongst the plethora of high performance methods present in the literature,38–41 in this study we use CC242 and CASPT243,44 results as the reference for the vertical transition energies to the lowest excited singlet (CC2)45 and triplet (CASPT2)46 states. The functionals analyzed are: B3LYP,22,36 M06-2X,34 PBE0,47 CAM-B3LYP,48 LC-ωPBE,49 BHandHLYP22,36 and B3PW91.22–24
It is important to keep in mind that commonly SF systems present extended structures, e.g. molecular crystals or thin films, which typically present redshifted transition energies with respect to the gas phase. In linear acenes, the S1 energies in the gas phase are 0.3–0.5 eV higher than in the crystal, while this shift is one order of magnitude smaller for the triplet state.6,50 This fact makes the 2T1–S1 energy difference around 0.4 eV more endoergic in the solid state, disfavoring the SF process in some cases, and favoring it in other cases with 2T1–S1 > 0. The case of tetracene is paradigmatic, since this molecule shows an almost isoergic 2T1–S1 value in the gas phase, but becomes endoergic in the solid state.51 The SF phenomenon can be activated anyway with soft heating.
In Table 1 are summarized the errors, as the average deviation with respect to the reference values (maximum values in parentheses), in the calculation of the first triplet (T1) and singlet (S1) excited states, together with the 2T1–S1 energy difference. Note that, for simplicity, the results for only five functionals are collected in this table, due to the similarities observed. A good performance is observed for the M06-2X functional, especially for tetracene and pentacene (see values in italics). Moreover, the M06-2X functional shows rather balanced errors for S1 and T1 energies. The errors for the S1 and T1 states computed at the B3LYP level are systematically larger, especially for the lowest singlet. On the other hand, the 2T1–S1 energies are in very good agreement with reference values due to error cancelation. The SF-BHandHLYP approach exhibits very good results in the calculation of S1 for tetracene and pentacene, but it shows larger errors in the computation of T1 energies. Such behavior is also obtained with the CAM-B3LYP functional, resulting in large 2T1–S1 errors, even for tetracene and pentacene. The results for the whole set of functionals are in Table S1, in the ESI.† Besides, in Table S2 (ESI†) are collected the maximum errors provided by each functional in the calculation of S1, T1 and 2T1–S1. There it is shown how far the PBE0 and LC-ωPBE functionals are from the reference 2T1–S1 values. Also high deviations arise from the B3PW91 functional, while the SF-B3PW91 seems to show better 2T1–S1 relative energies. However, this effect appears as an artifact due the compensation of the errors of the calculated S1 and T1.

In Fig. 1 are represented the computed errors for the 2T1–S1 energy difference, depending on the number of rings in the acene. Again, the best results are obtained with the M06-2X functional for tetracene and pentacene. B3LYP also provides reasonable results, especially in short-chain acenes. The SF-BHandHLYP functional performs very well for anthracene, but for larger acenes notable errors are found.

Since the M06-2X approach systematically provides S1 and T1 energies and 2T1–S1 differences with small errors with respect to reference values, we chose this approach to proceed with our study. Moreover, it is important to notice that the largest errors for 2T1–S1 are obtained for naphthalene and hexacene, for which the fission energy driving force is respectively over- and underestimated. Hence, we might expect that M06-2X energies will exaggerate the endoenergicity (exoenergicity) of those systems with large |2T1–S1|, i.e. those potentially less interesting as suitable singlet fission sensitizers. Additionally, we have also considered SF-BHandHLYP energies in order to explore systems with a strong diradical character, since this approach has shown good performance in such cases.52 In the manuscript we refer to M06-2X and the SF-BHandHLYP as TDDFT and SF-TDDFT, respectively.
4 Results and discussion
The structural and electronic features, in the ground and low-lying excited states, of a set of 90 carbonyls formed by one, two or three fused rings with sizes between three and seven carbons have been studied. This set has been designed in a previous work.18 All molecules contain one or two carbonyl groups in order to enable double-bond conjugation in the rings and are labeled using the following general nomenclature: n,m-C(x+y+z), where n and m refer to the positions of the carbonyl groups, and x, y and z the size of each ring, in increasing order. Additionally, an analogous set of molecules, denoted as quinone dimethides, is generated by substitution of the oxygen atom by a methylene group (CH2). Both groups of molecules, carbonyl and methylene derivatives, will be referred to as Q and QDM molecules, respectively, and the particular molecules within each group will be referred to as n,m-C(x+y+z)/Q or n,m-C(x+y+z)/QDM. The monosubstituted molecules are labeled as n-C(x+y+z). Those structures will also be referred to as Q and QDM although these molecules, strictly speaking, are not quinones or quinone dimethides. Furthermore, 26 highly symmetric molecules containing two carbonyl groups have been partially substituted with one methylene group, leading to quinone methide derivatives (QM), that will be labeled as n,m-C(x+y+z)/QM. In Fig. 2 some representative molecules of each group are shown (the whole set of molecules is depicted in Fig. S1 of the ESI†). Finally, for completeness, the bare rings are also studied in order to analyze the effect of the carbonyl and methylene substitution.

In the next sections, the results are presented and organized as follows: firstly, the diradical character is discussed in terms of the nature and the position of the substitution in the rings, using derivatives of naphthalene, C(6+6) in our nomenclature, as representative cases. Then, this property is analyzed in the full set of 206 molecules. Next, a thorough study of the low-lying excited states is performed, followed by an analysis of those systems that can be proposed as promising candidates to undergo singlet fission. Finally, an alternative process to the conventional singlet fission is briefly discussed.
4.1 Diradical character

4.1.1 Diradicaloid character in conjugated quinones and methylene derivatives. 
Despite the large number of molecules that are investigated in the present study, the observed trends in the diradical character can be rationalized performing a detailed analysis in selected molecules. Molecules belonging to the n,m-C(6+6) group, that is, derivatives of naphthalene, may be useful in this task, since the introduced modifications (position and kind of substituent) seem to play a clear role in the diradical character of the derived molecules.
In Fig. 3a, three representative open-shell Lewis structures are depicted to analyze the distribution of the spin densities, shown in Fig. 3b. Thus, in the 2,3-C(6+6)/Q molecule (Fig. 3b, left), large values of spin density are observed in ring positions 1 and 4, corresponding to resonance structure 2, generating an aromatic π-sextet (a benzene ring). When the carbonyls are substituted by methylene groups to form the 2,3-C(6+6)/QDM molecule (Fig. 3b, center), a shift of the spin density is observed towards the CH2 groups, corresponding to an intermediate situation between resonance structures 2 and 3, in any case keeping the benzene ring. The 2,3-C(6+6)/QM molecule (Fig. 3b, right) presents both characteristics, with an open-shell structure that includes large spin density values in the CH2 group and in the 1 and 4 positions of the rings. In this way, resonance structure 1 is unfavored due to the loss of aromaticity.

The green colour corresponds to ρ ≥ 0.9, while red colour corresponds to ρ ≤ 0.4. Intermediate values are denoted by intermediate color intensities. The calculations were performed at the UHF/aug-cc-pVTZ level of theory. 
The presence of substituting moieties in the naphthalene molecule has a dramatic effect on the diradical character, increasing from y0 = 0.04 in the unsubstituted molecule up to y0 = 0.41 in 2,3-C(6+6)/QM, y0 = 0.43 in 2,3-C(6+6)/Q and y0 = 0.59 in 2,3-C(6+6)/QDM derivatives (Table S3 and Fig. S2, ESI†). This is a relevant result, since, in the acene series, in order to have diradical characters of the same magnitude, the number of rings has to be increased at least up to 4. Thus, tetracene and pentacene, both paradigmatic molecules in singlet fission, show diradical characters of 0.27 and 0.42, respectively. This means that we are able to induce a similar diradical character as in tetracene and pentacene in smaller acenes, such as naphthalene. Nevertheless, the sole presence of the substituents in naphthalene is not enough to increase the diradical character, and their relative position in the rings must also be considered. Thus, 1,2-C(6+6)/Q is a closed shell (y0 = 0.00) and 1,2-C(6+6)/QDM shows only a slight diradical character (y0 = 0.12). This may also be explained by using the resonant structures. As has been mentioned before, the strong diradical character shown by the 2,3-C(6+6) structure is favored by the stabilization provided by the formation of the π-electron system.53 In the 1,2-C(6+6) isomers, this π-electron system is already present in the closed-shell representation, which would disappear in any other resonant structure.


4.1.2 Diradicaloid character of Q, QDM and QM molecules. 
In Fig. 4 are displayed the diradical character of the carbonyl (Q), methylene (QDM) and mixed (QM) derivatives (see the numerical values in Table S3, ESI†), together with the diradical character of tetracene and pentacene (red straight and dotted lines, respectively). In this manner, these two acenes with experimentally demonstrated singlet fission activity can be used as guidelines for the pursuit of adequate SF sensitizers.

As was mentioned in the Introduction, we observed in a previous work18 that many of the carbonyl derivatives (Q) possess a non-negligible diradical character, and the ground state should be described as a singlet open-shell state. Thus, the monocycles are basically closed-shell molecules, similar to bicycles including a three-membered ring, except for 1,3-C(3+5) and 1,3-C(3+7), which show a slight diradical character. Regarding the cyclobutadiene-based molecules, the relative position of the double bonds in cyclobutadiene leads to two different isomers that are labeled as: (a) with a double bond linking the shared carbons of the two rings and (b) with each shared carbon having a double bond. These bicycles show a remarkable diradical character, with y0 ≥ 0.40, especially those fused to six- and seven-membered rings, such as 3,4(a,b)-C(4+6) or 3,4(a,b)-C(4+7). Carbonyls containing five-membered rings show a small diradical character except 1-C(5+6), with a notable y0 value (0.42). Three molecules with two benzene rings and six with three benzene rings show remarkable diradical character and, finally, bicycles with seven-membered rings display a small diradical character.
When the carbonyl moieties are substituted by methylene, an important enhancement of the diradical character is observed. In most cases, the diradical character increases depending on the chemical nature of the substitution: y0(QDM) > y0(QM) > y0(Q). In fact, 70 molecules among the full QDM set show an enhancement in the y0 values compared to the Q set. Analogously, from the 26 QM calculated molecules, 18 show a larger diradical character than the carbonyl homologues. Molecules that have already showed a non-negligible diradical character experience a greater increase upon substitution of the carbonyl. Carbonyls that are basically closed-shell molecules remain this way, in general, but still some of them are found to have a non-negligible diradical character upon substitution. However, it should be noted that this trend is not always satisfied, such in 1,2(b)-C(4+4) or in 2-C(5+6). In general, all the studied acene derivatives: benzoquinone, naphthoquinone and anthraquinone, as well as their methylene derivatives, show a notable enhancement of the diradical character when compared with the parent acene molecule.
Regarding the number of rings, it has been previously observed in fused oligoacenes that the diradical character increases with the number of benzene rings.54 Nevertheless, this behaviour becomes evident from pentacene and, therefore, it is difficult to establish a direct comparison with the molecules analyzed in this work. Still, we observe that the diradical character of the 2,3-, 1,5-, 1,7- and 2,6-C(6+6)/Q,QDM isomers is notably increased when the third ring is included (C(6+6+6) group). Only the 1,2- and 1,4- isomers maintain basically the same diradical character, or even a small decrease is observed. As a summary, the size of the ring does not seem to be relevant for the diradical character of the studied molecules. The number of rings may have an influence in some cases, such as in six-membered cycles, but a clear trend is not observed for other rings. Instead, the relative position and the nature of the moieties are the key parameters for tuning this property.
We have also computed the tetraradical character (y1), which measures the ability of a molecule to place four unpaired electrons in different atoms. An increase of this parameter is related with the presence of a low-lying quintet state (Q1), which may negatively interfere with an eventual SF process, reducing the efficiency as a competing state. In Fig. 5a and b are represented the relation between y1 and the energy of Q1 with respect to the ground state, and the relation between y0 and y1, for all the Q, QM and QDM derivatives, together with the acenes. In general, larger y0 values accomplish larger y1 values; however, all the systems studied in this work show low y1 values, less than 0.10, although larger values than those of the acenes are observed, regarding the same number of fused rings. Larger y1 values indicate lower Q1 states. Nevertheless, most of the molecules show Q1 energies greater than 4 eV, still smaller than those of the acene series.

For comparison, the values of the acene series up to octacene (n = 8) have been included. 

4.2 Low-lying singlet and triplet states
In order to study the singlet fission process, the nature of the lowest singlet (S1) and triplet (T1) excited states is of paramount importance. The energy and character of the S0 → S1 and S0 → T1 transitions, as well as the oscillator strength for the Q, QDM and QM molecules, are collected in Table 2, 3 and 4, respectively. Since the large majority of the molecules show a small or intermediate diradical character, the computational analysis of this section will be performed at the TDDFT level. Molecular structures with a large diradical character have not been included in the following analysis.

The main striking difference in the substituted molecules with respect to pristine compounds is the nature of the transition in carbonyl-containing molecules due to the presence of the lone pairs of oxygen atoms. Concretely, 50 Q and 10 QM molecules show a S1 excited state with n → π* character and redshifted transition energies with respect to their unsubstituted counterparts. Moreover, the computed oscillator strengths to S1 in these cases are considerably lower since the n → π* transitions are less intense than the π → π* excitations. On the other hand, the promotion of lone pair electrons into π* orbitals in the T1 state is only obtained for 15 Q molecules. Comparing the S0 → S1 transition energies in the acenes (Table S4, ESI†) with those calculated in the Q, QM and QDM derivatives, a general decrease is observed upon substitution. This stabilization of the S1 state may be related to a larger diradical character, see Fig. 5c. In this way, QDM molecules are expected to show lower E(S1) values than Q molecules, due to the larger y0 values they exhibit. The nature of the transition plays a relevant role, and the presence of the oxygen lone pairs in carbonyl-containing molecules destabilizes the HOMO, having as a consequence a shift to lower transition energies, which, in many cases, exceeds the stabilization accomplished by y0, in such a way that in those cases, the following trend is observed: E(S1,QDM) > E(S1,QM) > E(S1,Q). In the case of the S0 → T1 transitions, this behavior is less clear and in many cases the trend is reversed: E(T1,QDM) < E(T1,Q). This may be ascribed to two features: first, a greater stabilization of the T1 state due to the diradical character and, second, most of the transitions in the Q derivatives are of π → π* type, as in QDM derivatives. In Fig. 5d is represented the variation of the singlet–triplet gap (STG) with the diradical character. It is well known that molecules with a notable diradical character display small singlet–triplet gaps, due to the stabilization of the T1 state (Table S5, ESI†). Inspecting Fig. 5d, we find that the optimal y0 values according to the energy requirements discussed above vary between 0.2 and 0.4.
The shift of the transition energy to lower energies due to the enhancement of y0 may also be used to tune the optoelectronic properties of conjugated hydrocarbons, to include a broader range of wavelengths. Nevertheless, the n → π* character of the S0 → S1 transition may negatively affect the light harvesting power of the material, since the oscillator strength is very low. In such cases, the possibility to excite to a higher S0 → Sn transition may be considered, E(Sn) in Tables 2 and 4, which may relax to the desired S1 state. Finally, it must be mentioned that the 1,3-C(3+5)/QDM molecule shows a S0 → S1 transition with σ → π* character and the same is observed for the S0 → T1 transition in 1,2-C(3+3)/Q. Nevertheless, these transitions are only 0.02 and 0.09 eV, respectively, lower than the π → π* transition.
4.3 Singlet fission suitability
In this section, the feasibility of each group of molecules to be potential candidates as singlet fission sensitizers will be analyzed. First of all, those molecules with a moderate diradical character (less than 0.4) will be the main target of the discussion, since an intermediate diradical character has been found to be optimal for singlet fission.14 Molecules with a strong diradical character are not likely to be good candidates since the 2T1–S1 values tend to be too negative (exoergic) reducing the efficiency of the process. All values discussed in this section have been obtained at the TDDFT level. Comparison to SF-TDDFT results can be found in Tables S7 and S8 (ESI†). The analysis of the SF performance will be done considering the energetic conditions 2T1–S1 ≤ 0 and 2T1–T2 < 0 discussed above, that will be referred to as the first (C1) and second (C2) conditions, respectively. It is experimentally seen that these conditions can be slightly relaxed, since tetracene, which is able to undergo SF, shows C1 = 0.14 eV and C2 = 0.07 eV. Therefore, in order to not exclude potential candidates, molecules with slightly positive C1 and C2 values will be also labeled as potential singlet fission sensitizers. In the following, we will use C1 as the main criteria and C2 as a secondary condition.
From the 206 molecules studied, only 6 molecules have a quintet state (Q1) below the energy of 2T1 (Table S5 and Fig. S3, ESI†), which may be a competitive state. Therefore, these molecules will be excluded from the analysis. Also, some other molecules have a low energy Q1, close to 2T1, that may reduce the efficiency of the process and, therefore, will also be excluded. The graphical representation of the 2T1–S1 values is displayed in Fig. 6, while the representation of the 2T1–T2 energy differences and all the numerical values are collected in Fig. S4 and Table S9 (ESI†), respectively. The computed 2T1–S1 values for tetracene (0.14 eV) and pentacene (−0.42 eV) (red lines in Fig. 6) will be used as a guide to evaluate the SF suitability of the studied compounds.
 Fig. 6  2T1–S1 energy differences, in eV, of the Q, QDM and QM systems. Red straight and dashed lines represent the values for tetracene and pentacene, respectively. 
Starting with the acene derivatives, in the n,m-C(6+6)/Q group, three molecules show negative values for the C1 and C2 conditions, namely, 2,3-, 1,5- and 1,7-derivatives. However, the C1 condition is too negative for the first two compounds and only 1,7-C(6+6) can be appointed as a good candidate for singlet fission. When the carbonyls are substituted by methylene groups, the diradical character is notably increased and three molecules should be rejected. From the remaining molecules, only the 2,6-isomer fulfills both conditions, but C1 is again too negative. Considering the QM group, too negative C1 values are recorded in general. Regarding the anthracene derivatives, n,m-C(6+6+6)/Q,QM,QDM, none of them accomplish the conditions for several reasons: large y0 values, positive C1 and C2 or too negative C1 values. Nevertheless, 1,10-C(6+6+6)/Q,QDM show values for C1 of −0.47 eV (Q) and −0.52 eV (QDM), rather close to the value of pentacene (−0.42 eV), and could eventually be considered as possible candidates. The enhancement of y0 in QDM with respect to Q derivatives in the n,m-C6 group, facilitates the fulfillment of the C1 condition in 1,2-C6/QDM. Analyzing the results from the SF-TDDFT calculations in the acenes (Tables S7 and S8, ESI†), we find a good agreement with TDDFT. The SF-TDDFT results suggest that 1,10-C(6+6+6)/Q should be also included in the list of singlet fission candidates.
Amongst the family of explored compounds, 2,6-C(6+6)/Q55 and the derivatives of 1,7-C(6+6)/Q56 and 1,5-C(6+6)/Q57 have been synthesized, while 2,3-C(6+6)/Q58 and 2,6-C(6+6+6)/Q59 molecules have been shown to be difficult to synthesize or isolate. The QM derivatives 2,3-, 1,5-, and 2,6-C(6+6) have also been synthesized.60,61 Finally, the n,m-C6/QDM molecules have also been found in the literature,62,63 despite being well known that they are very reactive. Molecules including a four-membered ring show a high diradical character in most cases and, therefore, they are probably not good candidates for singlet fission, with the only exception of 3(b)-C(4+5)/Q. On inspecting the molecules containing three-membered rings, none of them could be considered as potential candidates. A similar behavior is observed for the groups n,m-C(5+7) and n,m-C(7+7). In these examples, the diradical character is small or moderate, but the energetic conditions are not fulfilled. Nevertheless, it is important to notice that the 1,6-C(5+7)/Q compound has been isolated experimentally as a stable, yellow crystalline solid,64 and shows a C1 value close to the one for tetracene. In the literature it is also possible to find experimental data for the 2,6-C(5+7)/Q molecule,65 as well as some other derivatives.66 Our results are not conclusive for: 1,6- and 1,8-C(5+7)/Q, 1,4-C(5+7) (both Q and QDM) and 3,8-C(7+7) (both Q and QDM), since we find important discrepancies between the TDDFT and the SF-TDDFT computed energies. This disagreement has been also obtained for the n,m-C(5+5) group, where some of them are classified as good candidates by SF-TDDFT, whereas they should be discarded using TDDFT. It must be highlighted that 1,4-C(5+5)/Q satisfies both C1 and C2 conditions and has been synthesized.67 None of the molecules within the n-C(5+6)/Q family shows promising interstate energy gaps. However, in the QDM derivatives, 2-, 4-, and 5-C(5+6) fulfill the C1 condition, while in certain cases the T2 state is placed excessively low. Thus, only the 2-C(5+6) isomer (isobenzofulvene) seems to be appropriate to host singlet fission. This compound has been experimentally described68 as a blue compound that easily dimerizes at low temperatures. Other molecules from this group are also experimentally available, such as 1-C(5+6)/QDM (benzofulvene69) and 1-C(5+6)/Q (indenone70,71), but should be discarded. Regarding the C(6+7) group, three molecules can be considered as potential candidates: 6-C(6+7)/Q,QDM and 2-C(6+7)/QDM. Among them, the carbonyl 6-C(6+7)/Q should be highlighted, as it can be found in the literature72 as an orange compound that easily dimerizes in solution.
To summarize, 48 molecules are predicted to fulfill the first condition using TDDFT. However, for those molecules with a remarkable diradical character, this value is often too negative, which may be related to a loss of efficiency, as has been explained before. Hence, using the tetracene and pentacene values as boundaries for the first condition, up to 15 molecules can be selected with a C1 in between 0.14 and −0.42 eV. If we expand these boundary values by just 0.2 eV, up to 32 molecules can be taken into account, which are represented in Fig. 7. Besides, 12 of these molecules can be found in the literature as experimentally available, although sometimes as very reactive intermediates. Out of these 32 molecules, 10 fulfill the following, more restrictive conditions: −0.42 eV ≤ C1 ≤ 0.14 eV and C2 ≤ 0.2 eV. Namely, 1,7-C(6+6)/Q, 3(b)-C(4+5)/Q, 2-C(5+6)/QDM, 6-C(6+7)/Q, 6-C(6+7)/QDM, 2-C(6+7)/QDM, 1,2-C6/QDM, 1,2(a,b)-C(4+4)/QM and 1,4-C(5+5)/Q, which are highlighted with blue color in Fig. 7. Some of these molecules have been experimentally obtained, i.e. 1,7-C(6+6)/Q, 6-C(6+7)/Q, 2-C(5+6)/QDM and 1,2-C6/QDM.

4.3.1 Alternatives to the traditional singlet fission. 
In some cases, a molecule can undergo an upconversion mechanism, where two triplets can be combined to excite a molecule to a high energy excited singlet state and the following energetic conditions should be accomplished: 2T1–S1 > 0 and 2T1–T2 < 0. This process is known as triplet–triplet annihilation73–76 and it has been already observed in tetracene. In fact, the tetracene molecule shows a slightly positive C1, a feature that is also observed in a few molecules investigated in this work. Therefore, molecules such as 2-C(3+6)/QDM, 5-C(5+6)/Q, 5-C(5+6)/QDM, 4-C(5+6)/Q, 1-C(6+6)/QDM, 1,3-C(3+5)/QDM, 1,2(a)-C(4+4)/Q, 1,6-C(5+5)/Q, 1,6-C(5+5)/QM, 2,4-C(5+7)/Q, 2,4-C(5+7)/QDM, 2,9-C(7+7)/QDM or 1,4-C(5+5)/Q could also be suitable to be used as TTA materials.

5 Conclusions
In this work, the electronic and structural properties of 206 conjugated carbonyl (quinone, Q), methylene (quinone dimethane, QDM) and mixed (quinone methide, QM) derivatives have been analyzed including their diradical character, singlet–triplet gap, low-lying excited states and feasibility to undergo singlet fission, for the pursuit of new singlet fission sensitizers that may improve the performance of archetypal molecules such as tetracene and pentacene.
An important number of the studied molecules show a non-negligible diradical character, which is mainly affected by the nature of the substituents and their relative position. Thus, methylene moieties enhance the diradical character to a greater extent than the carbonyl ones, and the following trend is observed: y0(QDM) > y0(QM) > y0(Q). This characteristic affects the electronic structure of the ground and excited states and has implications in terms of the possibilities of the molecules to undergo singlet fission. As it was previously known,14 an intermediate diradical character is optimal for singlet fission, that is, the fulfillment of the energetic conditions 2T1–S1 ≤ 0 (C1) and 2T1–T2 < 0 (C2) is favored. Besides, larger diradical characters imply a shift of the absorption energy to larger wavelengths, from UV to visible or even near-IR, which may be useful for the design of new optical devices. The character of the S0 → S1 and S0 → T1 transitions of the QDM molecules is π → π*, while in some carbonyl-containing molecules (51 Q and 10 QM) these transitions show n → π* character. This feature is relevant for the selection of a suitable singlet fission sensitizer, since the n → π* transitions appear, in general, at lower energies than the π → π* transitions, which, in some cases, may help to fulfill the energetic conditions. From the total set of 206 molecules discussed in this work, 32 molecules fulfill the C1 condition between the limits −0.62 eV and 0.34 eV, and the energy difference is not excessively negative. Besides, out of these 32 molecules, 10 accomplish the following, more restricted conditions: −0.42 eV ≤ C1 ≤ 0.14 eV and C2 ≤ 0.2 eV and, therefore, they can be considered as promising candidates for new singlet fission sensitizers: 3(b)-C(4+5)/Q, 2-C(5+6)/QDM, 6-C(6+7)/Q, 6-C(6+7)/QDM, 2-C(6+7)/QDM, 1,2-C6/QDM, 1,2(a,b)-C(4+4)QM, 1,4-C(5+5)/Q and 1,7-C(6+6)/Q. Moreover, experimental evidence may be found in the literature for some of them, such as 1,7-C(6+6)/Q, 6-C(6+7)/Q, 2-C(5+6)/QDM and 1,2-C6/QDM. It is worth noting that a derivative of one of the compounds identified in this study, i.e. 1,2-C6/QDM, was already proposed as a potential SF sensitizer,13 and it has been experimentally shown to undergo efficient singlet fission.77–79 The diradical character of some molecules could result in poor chemical stability, which could be mitigated by the appropriate chemical substitution. Finally, an alternative mechanism has been considered, namely, the upconversion process known as triplet–triplet annihilation. Nevertheless, only a few molecules are found to be potential candidates to undergo this process.
In this manner, these systems can open new avenues for understanding singlet fission and be used to develop new SF sensitizers that may improve the performance of tetracene and pentacene.

 	Fig. 1  Computed errors for the 2T1–S1 energy difference (eV) for linear acenes, calculated with different xc functionals with the 6-31+G(d,p) basis set and including spin–flip TDDFT (SF) calculations.	 

 	Fig. 2  Representative molecules of each group, where X = O, or CH2.	 

 	Fig. 3  (a) Lewis structure of the 2,3-C(6+6) molecule in the closed-shell (top) and the open-shell (bottom) resonance structures. (b) Spin densities (ρ) of the 2,3-C(6+6)/Q,QDM,QM molecules. The green colour corresponds to ρ ≥ 0.9, while red colour corresponds to ρ ≤ 0.4. Intermediate values are denoted by intermediate color intensities. The calculations were performed at the UHF/aug-cc-pVTZ level of theory.	 

 	Fig. 4  Diradical character (y0) calculated at the UHF/aug-cc-pVTZ//B3PW91/6-31+G(d) level of theory, for the Q, QM and QDM derivatives. Tc and Pc states for tetracene and pentacene, respectively.	 

 	Fig. 5  Relation between (a) the tetraradical character (y1) and the energy of the first quintet state (Q1), in eV; (b) the diradical (y0) and tetraradical characters; (c) y0 and the energy of the first singlet state (S1), in eV and (d) y0 and the singlet–triplet gap (STG), in eV, for Q, QM and QDM derivatives. For comparison, the values of the acene series up to octacene (n = 8) have been included.
