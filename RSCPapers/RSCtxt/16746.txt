    , Accepted 30th August 2018First published on 30th August 2018AbstractThe first thieno[3,4-b]pyrazine (TP) based non-fullerene acceptor was synthesized and named as TP21, which shows a narrow band gap of 1.65 eV and a high-lying LUMO of −3.61 eV. Organic solar cells based on J61:TP21 realized a moderate power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 5.81% with a high open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.05 V.
Since 1995, organic solar cells (OSCs) have grown to receive considerable fundamental and technological interest due to their advantages of low-cost roll-to-roll production, light weight and flexibility.1–5 In the conventional bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) OSCs,6 the active layer consists of a p-type material as an electron donor and an n-type material as an electron acceptor that can form bicontinuous interpenetrated networks for both hole and electron transport. Recently, power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) beyond 14% have been achieved by using a donor–acceptor (D–A) type polymer as the electron donor and an acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) type small molecule as the electron acceptor.7,8 Therefore, it is vital to develop electron-deficient building blocks (A unit) for both p-type polymers and n-type small molecules.
From the viewpoint of the chemical structures, using CN double bonds is an indispensable way to construct electron-withdrawing units. To the best of our knowledge, there are four main kinds of two-membered rings based on CN double bonds, including benzothiadiazole (BT),9–14 benzotriazole (BTA),15–18 quinoxaline (Qx)19–22 and thienopyrazine (TP)23–26 (Table 1). The first three kinds of building blocks have allowed great success in the construction of both polymer donors and small molecule non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs), as shown in Table 1.

Regarding the history of BT-based photovoltaic polymers, the Dhanabalan group27 reported the first BT-based polymer in 2001 and it gave a relatively low PCE of 0.18%. Since then, several conjugated D–A copolymers based on BT or its derivatives were developed and applied in OSC devices.9–14 At present, the state-of-the-art BT-based polymers have achieved PCEs of 11.7%28 and 11.03%29 when paired with fullerene acceptors (FA) or NFA, respectively. Furthermore, the BT segment could also be used to construct NFAs due to its strong electron-withdrawing ability. In 2007, the Sellinger group30 reported the first BT-based NFA with a PCE of 0.45%. Recently, the highest PCE has reached 12.27%31 with a Voc of 0.8 V by using a BT-containing NFA. In principle, BT is the strongest acceptor unit among these four acceptors and usually shows excellent photovoltaic performance for both p-type polymers and n-type small molecules, although the Voc is always relatively low.
In comparison with BT, BTA has a similar structure but weaker electon-deficient ability, which results in an increased bandgap and up-shifted LUMO energy levels.32–35 Several p-type conjugated polymers combining BTA with different donor units have been developed15–18 and showed high PCEs of 8.40%36 (with FA) and 13.03%37 (with NFA), respectively. Very recently, our group reported several BTA-based NFAs, named as BTA1,32 BTA2,33 BTA334 and BTA13.35 Due to the high-lying LUMO energy levels, these materials could realize high Vocs of 1.02–1.22 V and high PCEs of 5.24–8.36% when combined with P3HT, J61 or J52-F.
As the third CN containing two-membered building block, quinoxaline (Qx) was first copolymerized with fluorene and yielded a PCE of 0.5%, which was reported by the Klemm group in 2006.38 Afterward, the Qx unit was also copolymerized with many types of electron-donating segments to obtain D–A alternative polymers.19–22 OSCs based on Qx polymers have exhibited PCEs as high as 8.44%22 (with FA) and 12.70%39 (with NFA), respectively. As a versatile electron-deficient unit, Qx was also applied in constructing NFAs, and a moderate PCE of 4.81% was achieved by using P3HT as an electron donor.40 In other words, the studies on the BT, BTA and Qx family proved that electron-deficient building blocks based on CN groups were very effective to construct both D–A type polymer donors and n-type small molecules, and also provided a guideline to design novel and promising photovoltaic materials.
However, the fourth building block of thieno[3,4]pyrazine (TP) demonstrated different photovoltaic results. In fact, TP is a planar, o-quinoid heterocycle, which is effective to decrease the bandgap of final photovoltaic materials.24–26 The first TP-based p-type photovoltaic polymer was APFO-Green2, reported by the Inganas group24 in 2005 and gained a PCE of 0.9%. However, the polymers based on TP moieties often suffer from some intrinsic drawbacks such as weak molar extinction coefficients and excess high HOMO energy levels41,42 which hamper the development of TP-based photovoltaic materials. For example, some TP based polymers show the absorption coefficients of 2.5–3.0 × 104 L mol−1 cm−1,25 which are obviously lower than those of BT-based (7.2 × 104 L mol−1 cm−1),43 BTA-based (8.5 × 104 L mol−1 cm−1)44 and Qx-based (6.8 × 104 L mol−1 cm−1)45 polymers. Thus, compared with the other three segments, very limited research has specifically been done on TP-based p-type polymers with the best PCE of only 3.08%.26 In addition, there are no reports on TP-based NFAs.
To extend the application of TP-based materials and investigate the structure–property relatioship, herein, we synthesized the first TP-based NFA, named as TP21. TP21 has a planar A2–A1–D–A1–A2 skeleton, where TP, rhodamine (R) and fluorene (F) were used as a bridge acceptor (A1), a terminal acceptor (A2) and a central donor (D), respectively. The OSCs based on TP21 as an electron acceptor and J61 as an electron donor could realize a moderate PCE of 5.81% with a high Voc of 1.05 V. This work demonstrated that the TP unit was also an effective building block to construct promising n-type low bandgap NFAs with high Voc and PCE values.
The chemical structure of TP21 is shown in Fig. 1a and the synthesis of TP21 is outlined in Fig. S1 (ESI†). TP21 was synthesized through four-steps. The starting material of 2,3-diphenylthieno[3,4-b]pyrazine was prepared as previously reported.46 The target compound of TP21 could be obtained from 2,3-diphenylthieno[3,4-b]pyrazine using bromination, Vilsmeier–Haack, Stille coupling and Knoevenagel condensation reactions. TP21 was fully characterized by 1H-NMR and MALDI-TOF, as shown in the ESI.†TP21 shows excellent thermal stability (up to 363 °C with 5% weight loss) (Fig. S3, ESI†) and is readily soluble in common organic solvents, such as dichloromethane (DCM), chloroform (CF), chlorobenzene (CB) and o-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB).
 Fig. 1  (a) Chemical structures; (b) the orbital energy levels of J61 and TP21, and (c) the UV-vis absorption spectra of TP21 in a film and solution and J61 in a film. 
Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were carried out on the molecular structure by using Gaussian at the B3LYP/6-31G level of theory. As shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†), the TP21 molecule adopts a flat backbone configuration while the two phenyl groups on the TP moiety exhibit a dihedral angle of 39° to the backbone plane which will help to restrict the severe self-aggregation and large-scale phase separation in the blend films.47 The HOMO of TP21 is delocalized over the whole molecule, while the LUMO is mainly distributed on the electron-deficient periphery. The calculated LUMO and HOMO of TP21 are −3.41 and −5.36 eV, respectively. These calculated LUMOs are obviously higher than that of BT-based small molecule FBR (−3.62 eV),51 which would lead to higher Voc values for organic solar cells.
The electrochemical properties of TP21 were studied via cyclic voltammetry (CV) with the film on a platinum plate. As shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†), according to the equation EHOMO/LUMO = −e(Eonset,ox/red + 4.8 eV), the HOMO and LUMO energy levels were calculated to be −5.46 and −3.61 eV. Because the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of J61 are −3.38 eV and −5.32 eV, respectively,48J61:TP21 is a suitable material combination (as shown in Fig. 1b). In addition, the LUMO of TP21 is higher than that of the classic NFA of ITIC,49 which should be able to realize a high Voc value for the J61:TP21 system.
The normalized spectra of optical absorption of TP21 in chloroform solution (∼10−5 mol L−1) and a thin film and the donor J61 in a solid film are shown in Fig. 1c. The TP21 solution exhibits a broad and strong absorption with two absorption peaks at 422 and 620 nm with the same maximum molar extinction coefficient (ε) of 8.4 × 104 L mol−1 cm−1. The absorption profile of TP21 shows two peaks at 422 and 620 nm due to the π–π* transition and internal charge transfer (ICT) from the central fluorene molecule (donor) to terminal acceptor units, respectively. Compared with the solution, the TP21 film displayed a significant redshift of 30 nm, which indicates intermolecular interactions existing in the solid state. The resolved shoulder of TP21 appears at 382 nm which is quite different from most of the NFAs. It is worth mentioning that most fluorene based small molecules showed a wide bandgap with values around 2.0 eV such as Flu-RH,50 FBR51 and DTBTF52 and so on. However, the absorption edge of TP21 locates at 753 nm with an optical bandgap of 1.65 eV, which suggests that the TP unit has better conjugation than the other linkers such as BT and thiophene.25,53
The photovoltaic performance of TP21 was examined by fabricating BHJ OSCs with a traditional device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/Ca/Al. During the optimization of the fabrication steps, the effects of thermal annealing (TA), D/A ratios and solvent additives on the device performance were investigated (see Tables S1 and S2, ESI†). Here, J61 was selected as the electron donor not only because it has a suitable energy level and complementary absorption with TP21 but also J61 matches well with the BTA-based acceptor of BTA3.34 As shown in Table S2 (ESI†), without using TA, the device of J61:TP21 showed a low PCE of 3.63%. When the TA temperature increased from 80 to 140 °C, the PCE was improved from 4.03% to 5.81%, with an average value of 5.64%. But when we continued to increase the TA temperature from 140 to 200 °C, the PCE decreased from 5.81% to 1.97%. After device optimization, a J61:TP21 weight ratio of 1:1 and chlorobenzene as solvent (the thickness of the active layer is ∼100 nm) with thermal annealing at 140 °C without using any solvent additive gave the highest PCE of 5.81% (Voc = 1.05 V, Jsc = 10.92 mA cm−2, and FF = 0.51). The current density–voltage (J–V) curve of the device is shown in Fig. 2a. In the end, 1-chloronaphthalene (CN) and diphenyl ether (DPE) were tested as solvent additives but the PCEs slightly dropped to 5.66% and 5.74%, respectively.
 Fig. 2  (a) J–V curve of the J61:TP21 device; (b) the EQE spectra of the J61:TP21 solar cell. 
The external quantum efficiency (EQE) plot of the device based on J61:TP21 is shown in Fig. 2b. The EQE curve of the device covers a broad response of 300–780 nm, which is in accordance with the UV-vis absorption spectra in Fig. 1c. The maximum EQE value of the device is 54% at 420 nm when annealed at 140 °C. The Jsc calculated from the integration of the EQE spectra using the AM 1.5 G reference spectrum is 10.9 mA cm−2, which matches well with the value obtained from J–V measurements.
To investigate the influence of TA on the photovoltaic performance, atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to examine the morphologies of the active layers. The film morphology of the J61:TP21 film with thermal annealing at 140 °C shows the root mean square (RMS) roughness of 0.96 nm, which is smoother than that of the blend film (1.2 nm) without thermal treatment, as shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†). In addition, the charge carrier transport of the device was also investigated using the space-charge limited current (SCLC) method. The annealed blend film of J61:TP21 (1:1, w/w) exhibits an electron mobility (μe) of 7.4 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1 and a hole mobility (μh) of 2.5 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, as shown in Fig. 3. We speculate that the unbalanced hole and electron mobilities with a large μh/μe value and the low electron transport mobility in the J61:TP21 device are the main reason for the low Jsc and FF in the corresponding device. Compared with other electron-deficient building blocks based on the CN double bonds, the relatively low FF and carrier mobilities hampered the further development of the OSC performance of TP21.

We believe that the photovoltaic performance of TP-based NFAs should be able to be improved by molecular engineering, introducing large fused rings such as indenofluorene (IF) and indacenodithiophene (IDT) as the central D part, and/or adopting strong electron-deficient units such as 2-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)rhodanine (RCN), 1,1-dicyanomethylene-3-indanone (IC) as the terminal A2 part. In addition, choosing the other donor polymers and optimization of the interfacial layers of the photovoltaic device are also underway.
In conclusion, the first TP-containing NFA with a symmetric A2–A1–D–A1–A2 backbone, using fluorene as the core unit of D, thieno[3,4]pyrazine as the linking units of A1 and 3-ethylrhodanine as the end-capped groups of A2, was designed and synthesized. The final molecule of TP21 exhibits excellent thermal stability, and strong and broad absorption with a narrow optical bandgap of 1.65 eV. Organic solar cells based on J61:TP21 achieved a high Voc of 1.05 V and a moderate PCE of 5.81%, which indicates that the TP unit is also an effective electron-deficient building block to construct promising NFAs.
