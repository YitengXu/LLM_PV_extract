    , Accepted 1st March 2023First published on 3rd March 2023AbstractWater electrolysis plays an interesting role toward hydrogen generation for overcoming global environmental crisis and solving the energy storage problem. However, there is still a deficiency of efficient electrocatalysts to overcome sluggish kinetics for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Great efforts have been employed to produce potential catalysts with low overpotential, rapid kinetics, and excellent stability for HER and OER. At present, hydrogen economy is driven by electrocatalysts with excellent characteristics; thus, systematic design strategy has become the driving force to exploit earth-abundant transition metal-based electrocatalysts toward H2 economy. In this review, the recent progress on newer materials including metals, alloys, and transition metal oxides (manganese oxides, cobalt oxides, nickel oxides, PBA-derived metal oxides, and metal complexes) as photocatalysts/electrocatalysts has been overviewed together with some methodologies for efficient water splitting. Metal–organic framework (MOF)-based electrocatalysts have been highly exploited owing to their interesting functionalities. The photovoltaic–electrocatalytic (PV–EC) process focused on harvesting high solar-to-hydrogen efficiency (STH) among various solar energy conversion as well as storage systems. Electrocatalysts/photocatalysts with high efficiency have become an urgent need for overall water splitting. Also, cutting-edge achievements in the fabrication of electrocatalysts along with theoretical consideration have been discussed.

1. Introduction
The increasing population leads to high energy consumption globally with the decrease in traditional fossil fuels and severe pollution issues, which are global challenges.1 Academic communities and industrialists have been probing supplementary power sources such as hydropower, wind energy, nuclear fusion, and solar radiation.1–3 Though weather, expenses, locations, and reserves are separate issues, modern society relies on fuels heavily for long-term due to low cost and abundant reserves.4 Besides the huge potential of energy manufactured from renewable resources, both intermittent as well as non-surplus energy sources extremely hindered their utility in large-scale applications. Recent mileposts in the development of hydrogen production, power plants, fuel cells, metal–air batteries, etc., have validated promising conversion technologies, sustainable, clean, ecofriendly, and renewable energy carriers.5–9 Metal–air batteries are alternatives for fossil fuel engines: Li–air battery holds reasonable theoretical energy (11140 W h k g−1) related to gasoline (12200 W h kg g−1),10,11 but it is not the best one in terms of safety and cost. Therefore, Zn–air battery is the choice that depends on performance, reserve, and cost, and the power density of Zn batteries and Zn–air batteries are 1084 W h k g−1 and 300 W h k g−1, respectively.10,11
Electrocatalytic water splitting needs less infrastructure requirement and can be carried out at ambient temperature when related to conventional coal gasification, cryogenic distillation, and steam reforming methods to meet the task of high efficiency.5 HER, OER, hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR), and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) are the heart of those technologies for the conversion reaction between chemical and electrical energies. Both OER and ORR operated metal–air batteries, whereas HER/OER produced H2 fuels via water splitting and HOR/ORR were the half reactions for fuel cells.12,13
Their polarization curves consist of equilibrium points of (0 V): (H2/H+: H2  2H+ + 2e−: HOR/HER) and 1.23 V (H2O/O2: 2H2O  O2 + 4H+ + 4e−: OER/ORR) vs. RHE (Fig. 1). If the applied voltage deviated from the equilibrium potential, the respective redox reaction takes place, and the difference between experimental and thermodynamic potentials is called the overpotential of respective reactions, which can be attributed to redox reactions and electrochemical cell design. The probable HER, OER, HOR, and ORR mechanisms are as follows.

The high overpotential of non-catalyzed electrocatalytic reactions leads to high energy consumption and hence low production. Therefore, electrocatalysts with low overpotential have been employed to enhance the reaction kinetics.14,15 Thus, efficient energy storage (stored as hydrogen, oxygenates, hydrocarbons, etc.,) and energy conversion systems were required.2 Among all the energy-stored compounds, hydrogen energy sources have numerous advantages including natural abundance, high energy density, easy storage, easy transportation, and, importantly, no harmful end product formation after burning.16–18 In this concern, the hydrogen economy concept has attracted increased attention worldwide, which is concentrated upon hydrogen-powered vehicles with hydrogen energy. Many car manufacturers (Hyundai, Ford, BMW, and Toyota) have made great efforts to launch hydrogen-powered vehicles in the future.19–21
Electrocatalytic water splitting is the potential alternative for ultrapure hydrogen production. The electrolyzer consists of two electrodes with OER at the anode and HER at the cathode.22Fig. 1 displayed two possible reaction pathways for HER: (i) Volmer–Tafel pathway (acidic electrolytes): H+–e− combination resulted in hydrogen atom formation, which adsorbed on active sites (H*), followed by reaction with adjacent hydrogen atom on active site (H*) evolved H2 and (ii) Volmer–Heyrovsky pathway, H2 produced by the combined reaction of adsorbed H− (H*) with another e−/H+. Accordingly, the Volmer–Tafel pathway becomes kinetically preferred for HER.
From 0.5 M H2SO4, the source of hydrogen was obtained directly from the electrolyte: in alkaline solution (1 M KOH), water dissociation offered hydrogen atoms for H2 production, which is more unfavorable than water splitting in acidic solutions. Rotating disk electrode (RDE) method is widely employed in studies on the hydrogen oxidation/evolution reaction (HOR/HER) due to excellent mass transport behavior: the measured HOR current was controlled by both electrode kinetics and diffusion of H2, and HER is assumed to be free of the diffusion limitation. Yan et al. reported that HER could be diffusion limited when the electrode kinetics becomes fast, as evidenced by the rotation speed dependent HER current on Pt in acid and the overlap of HER polarization curve with concentration overpotential curve.23 The diffusion limitation of HER originated from the slow mass transport of produced H2 on the electrode to the bulk electrolyte and the reversible nature of HOR/HER. Though the diffusion overpotential for HER becomes small, it has a significant impact on kinetic analysis in the low overpotential region, leading to inaccurate mechanistic interpretations.
The reversible nature of HOR/HER implies that reversible Koutecky–Levich equation:  should be used to calculate the kinetic current, while the use of irreversible Koutecky–Levich equation to obtain kinetic currents can lead to significant error when the electrode kinetics is facile, and the process is partially diffusion controlled. To obtain accurate kinetic information from polarization curve using the RDE method, Yan et al. recommended that iR correction should be performed to compensate the solution resistance, and the measured current should be corrected with the reversible Koutecky–Levich equation to get the kinetic current.
Franceschini et al. reported that Ni/Ru electrodes, after being characterized for different electrochemical techniques (LSV by RDE at different temperatures, EIS at different potentials), were subjected to a chronoamperometric pulse for 4 h to analyze the short-term ageing effect of the catalysts during the hydrogen evolution.23 Kouteckye–Levich analysis shows that there are changes in the number of electrons transferred, which increased after short term ageing and the Volmer reaction become the rate determining step except for the NR3600 catalyst, which seems to exhibit a change in the reaction mechanism after ageing. The results of Tafel and EIS analysis indicates Langmuir type H adsorption isotherm not only in freshly synthesized catalysts but also in aged catalysts, unlike that observed in pure nickel, where ageing induces a Temkin type H adsorption. All catalysts show well-defined charge transfer kinetic control at potentials above −0.50 (vs. SCE) and mixed kinetic diffusion control, occurring between −0.86 and −0.50 V (vs. SCE). In this zone of potential, the reduction of nickel oxides and the adsorption of water on the catalysts surface to form nickel hydroxide occurs, which is mainly related to the Volmer reaction (Fig. 2). Kouteckye–Levich plots obtained for NR500 and NR1800 at different potentials, before and after the chronoamperometric test, compared to the theoretical curve for one electron transference (dashed line) (Fig. 2). The linearity reveals that H2 evolution follows first order reaction and a noticeable change in jk is observed.23 The fresh catalysts show an increase in the electron transfer rate with increasing overpotential, whereas in the catalysts after chronoamperometry, the observed constant jk values (with overpotential), implying a rapid electron transfer. The obtained Levich slope (B) and transferred electrons number (n) (n < 1) (0.72 < n < 0.94) suggest that the Volmer reaction become the rate-limiting step. The mass transfer-corrected Tafel plots for the nickel/ruthenium-synthesized catalysts before (Fig. 2) and after (Fig. 2) chronoamperometry shows a shift in the equilibrium potentials for all the catalysts: the equilibrium potentials shift to more positive potentials with respect to pure Nickel by adding ruthenium.

Nickel/ruthenium catalysts before and after the ageing treatment reveal the same equilibrium potential, whereas the pure Ni catalyst after chronoamperometry shows a shift to higher overpotential. Tafel slope (−0.130 V dec−1) is similar for all the catalysts, except the NR3600 catalyst (change from −0.131 V dec−1 to −0.150 V dec−1) after chronoamperometry, which implies a change in the reaction mechanism.
The rotating disc electrode (RDE) can be used to enhance mass transfer and to attain controlled boundary layer thickness. However, the products in HER can block the electrode. Hence, most studies are limited to small overpotential and current densities, and the gas evolution rate becomes low. The investigation of HER on Pt were carried out by Bockris et al.24 up to a current density of 100 mA cm−2, Strumcnik et al.24 up to a current density of 125 mA cm−2, Kucernak et al.24 up to a current density of 125 mA cm−2, and Koster et al.24 up to a current density of 60 mA cm−2. An inverted RDE (IRDE) can be used to overcome this limitation:23 mass transfer characteristics of IRDE are similar to those of RDE. In IRDE, the electrode surface is oriented upward, and the gaseous products form microbubbles released shortly from the electrode surface and move up due to buoyant forces. Therefore, the bubbles do not grow on the electrode surface to a large size as in the case of normal RDE. IRDE has been used to study Ni–Mo alloys, Zn electrodeposition, CO2 reduction, pulse plating of Cu–Co, and Co electrodeposition.23 Studies on the fluctuation of concentration overpotential during HER on Pt IRDE in alkaline solution have been reported, and the hydrodynamics of two-phase flow and size distribution of microbubbles during HER on Pt IRDE in acidic solution have been reported.23 Since an electrode becomes oriented in the downward direction in a hanging meniscus configuration, it encountered the same difficulty in disengaging gas bubbles as normal RDE. The density of the gas bubble becomes lower than that of the electrolyte, and buoyancy facilitated the disengagement of bubbles in an IRDE, while it opposes the disengagement of bubbles in an RDE in a normal or a hanging meniscus configuration.
An inverted RDE setup was fabricated to study hydrogen evolution reaction on Pt in HClO4 solution. The IRDE setup was first validated by comparing the results of Ferro/Ferri redox reaction on the Pt electrode. Polarization experiments were conducted in HClO4 media with varying concentrations. HER currents over 300 mA cm−2 could be handled in IRDE without encountering the bubble blocking effect, thereby enabling investigation in a wider potential range than that is possible in RDE. At a high overpotential, diffusion becomes the rate-limiting step in all the concentrations employed. VH, VT, and VHT models were evaluated: fractional surface coverage of the adsorbed species and the surface concentration of H+ ions as a function of potential were estimated. The use of IRDE for studying the HER reaction with Pt in HClO4 implies that the VH model describes better results than VT or VHT models.
In three-electrode configuration, the efficiency of the HER catalyst was examined by rotating disc electrode (RDE). However, graphite/carbon rods (instead of Pt plates/wires) have been employed as a counter electrode because the dissolved Pt in the electrolyte can be deposited on the working electrode, which influenced the efficiency remarkably.23,24 Under basic conditions (OER), the OH− adsorbed on the catalyst surface to form the OH* intermediate, which reacts with other OH− to form H2O. The metastable intermediate (O*) reacts with OH− to form HOO* and released O2. When compared with HER, OER becomes sluggish because of four-electron transfer, and the reaction is highly dependent upon the binding energy of the intermediates (HOO*, HO*, and O*).
Microelectrode studies on polycrystalline platinum (Ptpc) implies lower HOR/HER exchange current densities (two orders of magnitude) in alkaline medium as comparted to acidic electrolytes. The RDE analysis of HOR/HER kinetics on Pt single crystals generated exchange current densities (1 mA cm−2Pt); however, neither HOR/HER exchange current densities nor mechanistic pathway have been reported for industrially relevant Pt/C catalysts (alkaline electrolyte). Sheng et al. reported the kinetics of HER and HOR on Ptpc and high surface area Pt/C using RDE measurements. The kinetic current densities were fitted to the Butler–Volmer equation (transfer coefficient, α = 0.5), from which the HOR/HER exchange current densities on Ptpc and Pt/C were determined. The HOR/HER rates on Pt electrode in 0.1 M HClO4 were limited by hydrogen diffusion when compared with the same in alkaline media, which rendered the quantification of HOR/HER kinetics impossible by RDE investigation. The simulation of hydrogen anode performance based on specific exchange current densities of HOR/HER (80 °C) reveal that in addition to ORR cell voltage loss on cathode, slow HOR kinetics were estimated to cause anode potential loss in alkaline fuel cells for low pt loadings (>130 mV at 0.05 mgPt cm−2anode and 1.5 A cm−2anode).25
The Butler–Volmer mechanism explained the HOR/HER kinetics (alkaline electrolyte) in the vicinity of the HOR/HER equilibrium potential for three of four limiting cases (Tafel–Volmer, Heyrovsky–Volmer and Volmer–Heyrovsky–Tafel mechanisms); the Tafel(rds)–Volmer mechanism was excluded because of the different kinetic expression. The DFT study on HER mechanism on Pt(111) established that the activation barrier of 0.15 eV (Volmer reaction) was found to be lower than 0.8 eV (Tafel) and 0.6 eV (Heyrovsky), which suggests that either one or both of the latter reactions become the rate determining step (transfer coefficient: 0.64 Tafel and 0.45 Heyrovsky).25 The theoretically calculated activation barrier (0.6–0.8 eV) on Pthkl was found to be higher than the experimentally (RDE-acidic electrolytes) measured activation barrier (0.2 eV). However, the experimental activation energy (0.5 eV RDE (Pt111); 0.1 M KOH) implied that HOR/HER kinetics becomes slow, and the value was quite comparable to the DFT energy. If the DFT model is correct, then the Volmer reaction would have the lowest activation barrier with a transfer coefficient of 0.45. The experimental observation implies that HOR/HER on Pt (0.1 M KOH) can be described by the Butler–Volmer equation with the calculated coefficient of 0.5, which favored the Heyrovsky–Volmer mechanism.25
Similar to metal–air batteries, an electrolyzer was fabricated to explore the overall water splitting by a bifunctional electrocatalyst. Overpotential, stability and Tafel slope [η = blog(j/j0)]; j-current density, b-Tafel slope, and (j0-exchange current density) are the factors employed to assess the efficiency of the HER/OER catalyst. The Tafel slope implies the reaction kinetics [Volmer/Heyrovsky/Tafel: 120/40/30 mV dec−1]: smaller Tafel slope implies faster charge transfer kinetics. The free energy of hydrogen adsorption (ΔGH) related to hydrogen adsorption (Hads) is used to evaluate the reaction:23–25 positive ΔGH reveal that Hads may have strong interaction with electrode surface (Volmer step), whereas negative ΔGH implies that Hads may have weak interaction with the electrode surface (Volmer step).26–29 The sluggish kinetics of OER usually requires a large overpotential for four-electron transfer to form several reaction intermediates and O–O bond formation.30–34 The electrochemical surface area (ECSA) can be assessed from the double-layer capacitance (Cdl) (ECSA = Cdl/Cs), which also evaluates the efficiency of catalysts.25
The roughness factor (RF) of an electrode defines the ratio of the electrochemical surface area to the geometric surface area (RF = ECSA/GSA).25 The relative RF was calculated by measuring the double layer capacitance (Cdl) in the non-faradaic current region. The voltammetric experiments were performed at low scan rates within an appropriate potential window with no faradaic process. The positive and negative current density differences in the middle of the potential window varied linearly with the scan rate (υ), confirming the non-faradaic nature of the current. The Cdl was determined as the slope of the current density vs. scan rate plot (Cdl = jc/υ). The charging current density (jc) varies linearly with υ, whereas purely faradaic current density (jF) varies linearly with υ1/2. Though the cyclic voltammogram contains no faradaic features, the jc might contain a minor faradaic component (jF), which can be deconvoluted by the procedure of Reyes et al.42jυ−1/2 and υ1/2 are linearly related through the equation jυ−1/2 = Kcυ1/2 + KF, where Kc and KF are the scan-rate independent capacitive and faradaic components, respectively.
Benck et al. reported the relation between the active site density, RF, and turnover frequency (TOF) in MoS2.25 From the sulfur–sulfur bond distance and the hexagonal arrangement of sulfur atoms on the MoS2 surface, the surface area occupied by each MoS2 unit as 8.593 Å2 per MoS2 were calculated. Therefore, the number density of MoS2 units on the atomically flat surface is 1.164 × 1015 per cm2 geometric area. If the RF of a catalyst is 100, the number of active sites per cm2 on the catalyst surface is 1.164 × 1017. To determine the total number of hydrogen turnover events per second on each active site (TOF), the number of hydrogen atoms produced per second per cm2 of the active surface area under a current density of 1 mA cm−2 can be computed as 3.12 × 1015 s−1 cm−2. The TOF of a catalyst surface containing was 1.0 × 1017 active sites per cm2@10 mA cm−2, which is simply given by TOF = [3.12 × 1015/1.0 × 1017 × 10] = 0.3 s−1 per surface site.
Turnover frequency (TOF) is the precise descriptor for estimating the straightforward intrinsic activity of a electrocatalyst. TOF measured the amount of product formed (H2/HER or O2/OER) or reactant consumed/unit time for a given amount of electrocatalyst. In contrast to heterogeneous catalysis, the amount of product formed (H2 in HER or O2 in OER) is not measured in electrocatalysis. Instead, the current density is used along with other necessary parameters, and hence, TOF values are always reported as a function of overpotential.25 Though many equations are used for TOF calculation, the most commonly used equation is TOF = j × NA/[F × n × γ], where J (mA cm−2) is the current density, A (cm−2) is the electrode surface area, NA is Avogadro's constant, F is Faraday constant, γ is the surface concentration or exact number of active sites catalyzing the reaction (cm−2), and n (HER/OER: 2/4) is the number of electrons transferred to generate one (molecule of the product). Some researchers used variations of the above equation: TOF = i × NA/(A × F × n × γ) and TOF = j/(x × F × γ) [i is the current and A is the area of the electrode and x is the number of moles of active sites available for (catalysis)]. Using the latter equation for calculating the TOF of HER and OER, n (number of electrons transferred when H2 or O2 is formed) becomes 2 and 4, respectively.
For OER, an indirect method is used for the determination of TOF by ORR at the ring electrode using a rotating ring disk electrode (RRDE) assembly. The catalyst-modified disk electrode is subjected to potential ramp over the desired potential window within which OER occurs significantly, while the ring electrode was maintained at a constant cathodic potential sufficient for reducing the O2 evolved from the disk electrode. In this case, the following equation is used: TOF = iR/A × F × n × NCL × r; iR is the ring current and NCL is the collection efficiency of RRDE. Though the RRDE manufacturers provided the standard NCL, it tends to change significantly upon use. Hence, it is to determine the NCL of RRDE used with standard redox probes ferro–ferri redox couple.26 This method can also be used for HER by setting a constant anodic potential at the ring electrode, which is sufficient to cause the concurrent electro-oxidation of H2 evolved from the disk electrode, whose potential is swept in the cathodic region. However, one should be vigilant in setting the anodic potential as the HER and HOR are not separated by larger overpotential windows such as OER and ORR. There is also another approach that does not involve current, Faraday constant (F), and the variations thereof: the quantity of H2 or O2 evolved is determined directly by means other than recording the current by conventional water displacement with an inverted graded cylinder and GC-MS. The water displacement method is straightforward but it requires more time as the catalyst must produce a sufficient volume of gas that can be identified with naked eye. Though it is a straightforward method, catalyst degradation and high chances of human error during the measurement is the major problem. Hence, GC-MS with H2 sensor has been used for the determination of FE in HER. This can also be used for TOF calculation, provided that the exact number of active sites is known. 0TOF becomes the activity marker; however, its imperfect calculation due to the problem in calculating the number of active sites is the major issue; hence, the exact number of active sites using real surface area was reported for TOF determination.
Several electrochemical methods are used to determine the exact number of active sites or the real surface area, whose hydrogen underpotential deposition (HUPD), Cu underpotential deposition (CuUPD), Pb underpotential deposition (PbUPD), CO striping, and redox peak integration are the most important. However, these methods are very material-specific and cannot be applied universally for all electrocatalysts. The exact number of active sites or the number of moles of active sites for TOF calculation and the crystallographic information of the metallic surface catalyzing the reaction of interest must be known because the charge integrated under the UPD peak is highly dependent on the faceting of the catalytic surface. The HUPD charge of Pt for the (100) and (111) planes is 200 and 230 μC cm−2, respectively, whereas the polycrystalline surface will have a charge of 210 μC cm−2.
The water oxidation reaction required a minimum energy input corresponding to 1.23 V (vs. NHE) for driving the whole reaction at pH 0, which is a thermodynamically and kinetically demanding process. However, the multistep electron transfer process with high-energy intermediates required extra energy to accelerate the electron transfer and it makes it difficult to achieve efficient water oxidation without a significant overpotential. Continuous steps were made to produce efficient electrocatalysts for water oxidation at the overpotential.22 Though noble metal-based electrocatalysts (IrO2/RuO2-OER and Pt-HER) have been widely used, high costs could be the major burden for large-scale production (∼133 tons of Pt mined annually: highest price over past 10 year. exceeded $2200 per oz).35 Hence, the development of earth-abundant efficient electrocatalysts is an urgent requirement for future hydrogen economy.
To overcome high-cost issues, low-cost electrocatalysts have been established to have stable and efficient activity. Transition metal borides, sulfides, selenides, phosphides, carbides, and nitrides have been utilized in HER,36–42 whereas transition metal hydroxides, oxides, polymeric carbon nitride, and phosphates have been used in OER.43–45 Although these electrocatalysts exhibit excellent HER (alkaline)/OER (acidic) behavior, the water-splitting efficiency becomes unsatisfactory when employed in the same electrolyte: under acidic conditions, HER catalysts generated mass H2 but showed poor OER efficiency, whereas OER catalysts exhibit excellent performance but low H2 production under alkaline conditions.45 Therefore, the integration of HER and OER catalyst in one cell (bifunctional catalyst) becomes the main problem, which consists of balanced electron donating–accepting behavior, thus assisting both HER and OER reactions. To lower the production cost of hydrogen, an efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst is urgently required to simplify the water-splitting process. Overall water oxidation with electrocatalysts/photocatalysts has become the low-cost potential strategy to enable large-scale H2 production owing to easy synthesis, simple reactor, and easy design. STH efficiency can be calculated under the operational conditions;46–49 the calculated STH efficiency using electrocatalysts/photocatalysts implies that the development of efficient overall water splitting has become vital to harvest STH needed for scalability.
Herein, we have reviewed the recent improvements in overall water splitting by bifunctional electrocatalysts, including metal hydroxides/oxides, alloys, metal nitrides, metal phosphides, metal chalcogenides, heteroatom-doped nanocarbons, metal borides, metal carbides, and MOFs. We attempted to dig out the approaches for improving the bifunctional performances, involving anion/cation doping, multimetal system, and other optimizing strategies from recent publications and reviewed them. Finally, the future challenges of this emerging field have also been discussed briefly.
2. Evaluation of electrocatalysts
The two kinds of electrodes employed to investigate the catalytic efficiency are (i) electrodes with nanostructured catalysts coated on the conductive surface of glassy carbon electrodes (GCE) and (ii) to develop catalysts on a 3D structure (Ni foam, Ti mesh, carbon fiber papers, and Cu foam) since 3D electrodes exhibit higher efficiency than 2D electrodes owing to their more active surface with excellent conductivity (Fig. 3). The absence of binders that permits rapid proton/ion diffusion and development of 3D non-precious electrocatalysts exhibits rapid move toward commercial applications.50–52 Specific parameters such as Tafel slope, electron transportation, impedance measurements, stability, faradaic performance, TOF, overall catalytic activity, and double-layer capacitance have been required to evaluate the efficiency of HER or OER.53–55 PBA-based HER catalysts show excellent tolerance in alkaline/acidic media because of the carbon layer.56–68 Li et al. reported Co@NG (cobalt NPs wrapped in N-doped GC layer) by the carbonization of Co–Co PBA, which shows identical morphology with Co–Co PBA (20 nm CoNPs covered by 5 to16 layers of GC shell).65 The metal particles were almost removed by acid leaching and resulted in hollow graphene spheres. The synthesized Co@NG/Co@NG-acid (1 M KOH-220/200 mV: 0.5 H2SO4-183/172 mV) exhibits excellent HER activity in both conditions because of the increased conductivity and large surface area of graphene.
 Fig. 3  Representation of bifunctional electrocatalysts’ performance of water splitting. 
The decomposition of Co3[Co(CN)6]2 (PB–Co) at high temperature yielded metallic Co cores encapsulated in multilayered N-doped graphene shell: at decomposition, Co(II/III) of PB–Co reduced to Co(0), which is the real catalyst for the formation of N-doped graphene, and the metallic Co cores were removed by acid treatment. The rich nitrogen content afforded nitrogen doping, which is essential for the bifunctional activity of both Co@NG and Co@NG-acid. The ORR efficiency of Co@NG was analyzed (600 °C): the polarization curve on RRDE shows a positive potential and half-wave potential of 0.90 V (vs. RHE) and 0.83 V, respectively (O2-saturated 1 M KOH). The peroxide yield (<10%) and number of electron transfer (>3.8) has been determined from the ring current, suggesting four electron reduction of molecular O2, which is superior to other materials with identical metal core/graphene shell (TM@G).65 Co@NG becomes less active (0.5 m H2SO4: potential 0.77 V and half-wave potential 0.58 V), which also be better than other TM@G.65 The Tafel plot (KOH/H2SO4: Co@NG (40/75 mV dec−1); Co@NG-acid (43/57 mV dec−1); pt/C (57/59 mV dec−1)), CV curves, as well as RDE polarization curve (O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH and 0.1 M HClO4) at various rotation speeds promoted the ORR performance. In 1.0 M KOH/0.5 M H2SO4, the HER polarization curve of Co@NG shows an onset overpotential of ≈70/50 mV@10 mA cm−2 with an overpotential of 220/183 mV (Co@NG-acid-200/172 mV) and a Tafel slope of 112/100 mV dec−1, suggesting the Volmer process as the rate-determining step. Acid treatment of the electrocatalyst enhanced the HER activity, which suggests that Co cores are not the part of HER active sites. Zhang et al. reported that Co–N–C moieties consists of the coordination of cobalt sites with three C-atoms and one N-atom, which promoted the HER activity.47 The robust electrocatalytic activity toward HER reveals that Co@NG and Co@NG-acid are excellent non-noble metal-based catalysts among all (Table 1).65

Li et al. reported Co@Co–N/rGO for HER (thermolysis of Co–Co PBA:GO:g-C3N4), which exhibited a wrinkle-layered structure, where Co NPs (10–50 nm) have a uniform distribution in the graphite carbon layer.66 The stable electrocatalyst Co@Co–N/rGO exhibita a low overpotential (180 mV) and a small Tafel slope (43 mV dec−1) in 1.0 M KOH for HER. Paik et al. reported Ni–Co–MoS2 having a nanocubic structure (side length 440 nm) and the aggregated ultrathin nanosheets appeared as nanoboxes, which show excellent electrocatalytic activity (overpotential 155 mV; Tafel slope 51 mV dec−1) for HER in 0.5 M H2SO4.67 Shen et al. reported Ni–Fe phosphide, a highly active HER electrocatalyst (1.0 M KOH/0.5 M H2SO4: overpotential 121 mV/70 mV (10 mA cm−2) and 266 mV (0.5 M H2SO4: 100 mA cm−2)) due to the abundant active sites and synergistic effect in Ni–Fe phosphide nanosheet arrays.68
3. Metals and alloys
Miles et al. reported the catalytic efficiency of non-precious metals (Ni > Mo > Co > W > Fe > Cu > Mn);40 poor stability and aggregation are the major problems for non-precious metal catalysts.69–71 To solve these issues, substrates/supports have been used to speed up the catalytic reaction and to protect the metal core from corrosion in harsh conditions. The functionalized substrates enhanced the catalytic performances due to increased active sites, enhancing the charge transfer (CT) from the supports to the catalyst surface and fabricating the catalyst-support interaction to regulate the active sites. Transition metals coupled with N-doped carbonaceous electrocatalysts may promote the water splitting efficiency.72–74 Ren et al. reported Ni@NC (Ni-loading on N-doped C) for overall water splitting, where carbon support assisted the dispersion of Ni particles, which leads to minimizing the contact resistance between them. Also, the active surface of N-sites tuned the electronic states and active centers, which in turn improved the catalytic activity.75 Xu et al. fabricated Ni-encapsulated N-doped graphene (Ni@NC) (Fig. 4) that exhibited efficient water splitting with 1.60 V@10 mA cm−2 due to the synergistic effect of Ni NPs with N-doped graphene shell.76 Chen et al. described the bifunctional electrocatalyst, NiQD@NC@rGO, which demonstrated water splitting at 1.563 V in alkaline medium.77
 Fig. 4  Synthetic process of the Ni@NC electrocatalyst. 
The alloy electrocatalyst was demonstrated as a potential electrocatalyst than single metals because alloying tuned d-band filling, which assisted the attraction of the alloy catalyst to the adsorbate species. The high-entropy porous alloys were reported as promising electrocatalysts due to abundant active sites and multiple functionalities. The low-cost Ni-/Co alloys have been studied extensively and the HER efficiency of Ni-based alloys is in the order Ni–Mo > Ni–Co > Ni–W > Ni–Fe > Ni–Cr.78 Electrocatalysts with nanoparticles,79 microspheres,80 hollow nanorods,81 and nanowires82 enhanced the active sites and enhanced the efficiencies. Zhang et al. reported the Ni–Fe alloy (bamboo-like carbon nanotubes) and its two-electrode system NiFe/NC//NiFe/NC, which exhibited 1.58 V without degradation in 24 h.83 Feng et al. stated that MoNi4 anchored on MoO2 cuboids exhibits 15 mV (@10 mA cm−2) and low Tafel slope (30 mV dec−1) in 1 M KOH for HER. DFT analysis reveals that the Volmer step was hastened with the MoNi4 electrocatalyst.84
In contrast to iridium metal, the poor stability of metal-based catalysts in acid electrolyte become the major issue. Feng et al. reported that dispersed Ir NPs on GF (Ir/GF) shows an overpotential of ∼7 mV and ∼290 mV for HER and OER, respectively (0.5 M H2SO4).85 The doping of non-noble metals into Ir becomes another strategy to optimize the efficiency: IrM (M–Ni, Co, Fe) nanoclusters (1.5–2.0 nm) on carbon substrate exhibits ∼1.58 V in acidic solution.51 Gao et al. reported that Co/Ni–N exhibits ∼100% Faraday efficiency with 1.59 V.86 Increasing more metals into the alloy enhanced both the OER and HER activity.86–93 Yang et al. reported NC-wrapped FeCoNi, which exhibits higher HER/OER activity because the electronic structure of the ternary alloys was tuned by changing the metal compositions of FeCoNi.87 However, porous alloys are unsuitable for practical applications owing to high cost, high overpotential, and complicated synthesis. To overcome these issues, the enhanced activity of porous alloys can be harvested by coupling with MOFs, carbon-based materials, MXenes, etc., due to their unique catalytic properties.
Though the PBA electrocatalyst exhibits good performance in water splitting, there is still a long way to go for its use as a electrocatalyst in commercialization because of its low conductivity/low current density, which results in low efficiency and high overpotential with low stability. The PBA-based electrocatalysts well addressed these issues by showing improved conductivity, activity, and stability. Therefore, PBA-based electrocatalysts have significant attention for water splitting. Since PBA-based OER catalysts have much richer variety than PBA-derived HER electrocatalysts, we have grouped them into metal oxides, metal chalcogenides, metals, metal phosphides, alloys, etc. Also, PBA-based metal NPs show precise surface area and homogeneous active sites owing to the porous characteristics. In situ generated GC-PBA exhibit enhanced conductivity and N-doped PBA show excellent OER performance.94–102 PBA-based metal alloys exhibit excellent electrocatalytic performance when compared with single metal due to the synergistic effect. Xu et al. reported FeNi@NC (Fe–Ni PBA encapsulated on graphene as precursors) with a size of 20 nm, which are homogeneously scattered on RGO and show the best efficiency.101 The FeNi alloy wrapped on N-doped GC (FeNi@NC/graphene) exhibits enhanced electrocatalytic activity (261 mV @ 10 mA cm−2 and 120 h durability) because of rapid carrier conduction. Song et al. reported O-NiFe@C (treatment of O2 plasma with GC-encapsulated NiFe alloy) for OER and show good electrochemical activity (overpotential 250 mV@100 mA cm−2: 300 mV@100 mA cm−2).102 Though PBA-based electrocatalysts have been widely studied, they still faced numerous challenges: (1) most PBA-derived electrocatalysts are active in alkaline electrolytes, which excludes their utilization in proton exchange membrane (PEM)-based electrolysis cells; (2) efficient catalysts utilized for industrial production must drive >500 mA cm−2@low overpotential; however, none of the PBA-derived catalysts meet this requirement, and (3) the catalytic mechanism of PBA-derived catalysts for HER and OER needs to be further exposed in combined with theoretical simulation.
4. Transition metal oxides and hydroxides for water oxidation catalysts
Metal hydroxides and metal oxides are less stable and start to dissolve in acidic solution at high overpotential (except RuO2 and IrO2). Grätzel et al. demonstrated NiFe hydroxide bifunctional catalyst with 12.3% efficiency and 1.7 V in basic media, which showed metal oxides/hydroxides as efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts.103
4.1. Manganese oxides (MnOx)
Manganese oxides provided high driving force for water oxidation (wide pH range):104 Mn4CaO5 employed for water oxidation (from MnO2/Mn minerals) in alkaline medium.105–110 Morita et al. deposited a mixture of Mn2O3 and β-MnO2 (manganese nitrate decomposition) and established water oxidation in acidic/basic media.111 MnOx oxidized water for 20 h effectively without an increase in the overpotential (1 M KOH), whereas an increase in the overpotential by 150 mV over 20 h in acidic medium was ascribed to an increase in the oxygen content in the film.111 The mixture of β-MnO2 and Mn2O3 was found to be more active than pristine β-MnO2, and the explanation for the enhanced activity is still under debate.
Ohsaka et al. reported electrochemically deposited MnOx nanorod on γ-MnOOH, which exhibited excellent activity in basic medium that dropped in acidic and neutral media.112 The electrodeposited MnOx film with different morphologies and phases from ionic liquid (IL) have been established:113 the morphology of the MnOx film was optimized by the pH of the electrolyte. In alkaline medium, the film predominantly consisting of Mn2O3 (birnessite-like phases) showed the maximum activity, whereas in neutral/acidic IL electrolytes, the film is almost inactive. MacFarlane et al. reported MnOx film deposition using ethyl ammonium nitrate IL, generated 1 mA cm−2 at 150 mV (butyl ammonium bisulphate electrolyte), and solvated H2O2 was the main product of water splitting by these films, which decomposed to O2 and H2O.114
Theoretical studies reveal that the formation of H2O2 was favored at low overpotential and stabilized in hydrogen-bonded complex form. The enhanced catalytic activity of MnOx in basic media implied that these metal oxides have been used in solar-driven water splitting; however, no clarification was delivered for the higher activity of MnOx in basic media.114 Takashima et al. concluded that the instability of Mn3+ (pH < 9) leads to low efficiency under neutral/acidic condition:115 Mn3+ disproportionated to Mn2+ and Mn4+ at pH < 9, whereas at high pH, stable Mn3+ was involved in water oxidation (Fig. 5). Jaramillo et al. electrodeposited thin film of sodium birnessite that showed water oxidation at 450 mV (0.1 M NaOH/visible light irradiation) and showed higher stability but exhibited low quantum efficiency (<0.1%) due to low conductivity.116
 Fig. 5  Robust electrocatalysts for water splitting reaction. 
Nanosized amorphous CaMnOx oxidized water in CAN as an oxidant (TOF 0.002 s−1 mol−1).117 Najafpour et al. reported Mn(IV) oxide with excess oxidant including CAN, H2O2, Ru(bpy)33+, and oxone for water oxidation. The higher activity for Mn(IV) oxide > α-Mn2O3 or MnO2 was attributed to more dispersibility and large surface area.118 Dismukes et al. reported λ-MnO2 (delithiation of LiMn2O4) with [Ru(bpy)3]2+ as a photosensitizer, visible light, and Na2S2O8 as an acceptor at pH 5.8.119 Pristine LiMn2O4 was inactive but on treatment with HNO3, cubical Mn4O4 cluster was formed, which showed higher water oxidation activity. Frei et al. reported MnOx/silica scaffold in the presence of [Ru(bpy)3]2+, pH 5.6, and visible irradiation shows an overpotential of ≈350 mV (TOF 3330 s−1).120 The stable support (silica) for MnOx plays a vibrant role and enhanced MnOx activity by preventing nanocluster decomposition.
4.2. Cobalt oxides
CumOx oxidized water ([Ru(bpy)]3+ as the oxidant) due to cobalt hydroxide/cobalt oxide precipitation.121 Harriman et al. reported spinel Co3O4 for water oxidation ([Ru(bpy)3]2+ as the oxidant; Na2S2O8 as the electron acceptor; visible light excitation), which showed a turnover number (TON) of ∼30. Jiao et al. reported that Co3O4 clusters on mesoporous silica support showed a high TOF of 3450 s−1 with 350 mV (pH 5.8).122 Casey et al. reported electrochemically deposited CoOx film as an efficient water oxidation catalyst under neutral conditions.123 Nocera et al. reported that electrochemically deposited cobalt oxide film at 1.1 V shows 100% faradaic efficiency: the amorphous film consists of a substantial amount of anion from phosphate or borate buffer utilized for electrode position.124–126 Britt et al. reported CoOx film for water oxidation (pH 0–14). At pH < 3.5, homogeneous catalysis leads to H2O2, while at pH > 3.5, water oxidation results from heterogeneous catalysis by CoOx film. The pH-dependent redox processes reveal that the layered double hydroxide (LDH) structure enhanced H+/e− transfer and unchanged metal oxidation state without reorganization in the coordination of cobalt centers.127
4.3. Nickel oxides
Water splitting by nickel alloys have been investigated widely.128–130 Bode et al. reported the redox cycle of various phases of Ni(OH)2 and NiOOH;131 α-Ni(OH)2(Ni2+) underwent dehydration and led to β-Ni(OH)2 (Ni2.2+) formation.132 The oxidation of nickel hydroxide under bias yielded β-NiOOH (edge sharing NiO6 octahedra-Ni2.8+ and Ni3.2+) or γ-NiOOH (Ni3.5+).132 Though NiOOH was reported as an efficient catalyst, there is still debate on either β-NiOOH or γ-NiOOH becoming the effective catalyst. Chialvo et al. reported β-nickel hydroxide film with an enhanced catalytic activity in NaOH.133 Wang et al. reported β-nickel hydroxide film without Co-coating (666 mV) and with Co-coating (700 mV) for water oxidation.134 Brandon et al. reported that β-NiOOH with Ni3+ promotes O2 evolution at the Ni electrode.135 Srinivasan et al. established that γ-NiOOH shows poorer conductivity than β-NiOOH (Ni4+) due to the higher oxidation state and constructing β-NiOOH, which is more suitable for water oxidation than γ-NiOOH.136 The decreased activity of NiOx in basic medium may due to Ni4+ formation, which becomes a less active water oxidation catalyst.135,136
Bell et al. reported the water oxidation of β-NiOOH deposited on Au, Ni, and Pd anodes.137 β-NiOOH deposited on Ni electrodes exhibited 3 times higher activity than γ-NiOOH; however, β-NiOOH is not the active species in OER because of the formation of an unidentified oxide before water oxidation. However, water oxidation by nickel–borate film contradicted the excellent activity of β-NiOOH over γ-NiOOH.138 Nocera et al. reported an NiOx film (from nickel(II) salt/borate buffer); the Ni–B film catalyzed water oxidation at a pH of 9.2 effectively.139,140 1,2-Diaminoethane-Ni complex ([Ni(en)3]2+) in borate buffer exhibited 1.5-fold higher catalytic activity than the γ-NiOOH phase.141 Wang et al. reported that n-Si/NiOx evolved O2 rapidly at 132 mV on irradiation.142 Based on the volcano plot, transition metal-based electrocatalysts (TMBM) exhibit higher HER performance because of the identical Pt structure (higher density of states (DOS) with the near Fermi level that is beneficial to the adsorption of intermediates), corrosion resistance, excellent stability, and good conductivity. TMBM effectively catalyzed OER because of the synergy between the intrinsic TMBM and outer-layer (oxy) hydroxides (in situ formation).143 However, TMBM show low energy efficiency because TMBM were formed by incorporating C (N or P) atoms into a metal lattice, which required high temperature to overcome the kinetic (thermodynamic) barriers and yielded large-sized particles, which is not advantageous for high catalytic activity.143
Layered double hydroxides (LDH) (alternative to noble metals) have gained great attention due to abundant M–O/M–OH active sites; however, they suffer from poor conductivity.144–147 Hence, efforts have been taken to enhance the conductivity by growing LDH onto electron-conducting substrates (NF, graphene, metal carbides, CNTs, etc.).148–150 NiFe LDH with carbon support exhibited a low overpotential (∼220 mV) (bare NiFe LDH-270 mV),151 and NiFe LDH-MoS2 showed improved OER activity when compared to bare NiFe LDH.152 As compared to 2T MoS2, metallic and hydrophilic 1T MoS2 assisted the CT interactions in the LDH MoS2 composite and resulted in high OER performance.153,154 However, the thermodynamically unstable 1T phase and its easy conversion to the 2T phase restricted its utility as a conducting support in stabilizing the LDH layers. Therefore, it is essential to synthesize a composite with stable 1T MoS2 having contact with the LDH layers to harvest excellent OER activity. An active OER electrocatalyst, LDH/MoS2 (MNF) produced by growing NiFe LDH with 1T-MoS2 (mass loading of 0.14 mg cm−2), showed a small overpotential (190 mV) and Tafel slope (31 mV dec−1).155 The electrocatalyst shows a mass activity of 97 A g−1 (200 mV), which is 14 times higher than RuO2 (7 A g−1). The stable electrocatalyst (MNF@CP) fabricated by loading MNF on porous carbon paper displayed a current output for 45 h and durability of 1000 CV cycles. The electronic properties and structure of nickel have been tuned by Sn metal coupling (Ni2−xSn), followed by operando structural transformation; synthetically-tuned Ni2−xSn (x = 0.35, 0.50, and 0.63) and operando-induced phase transformation of the orthorhombic Cmcm space group (Ni2−xSn_RT) to the hexagonal P63/mmc space group (Ni2−xSn_HT) (Fig. 6–9) enhanced the H2 evolution [Ni1.35Sn_RT]/Ni1.5Sn_RT/Ni1.63Sn_RT (Overpotential 251/271/327 mV; Tafel slope 69/76.8/116.9 mV dec−1; RCT 256.9/110.5/372.7 Ω; Cdl 20.18/20.33/25.43 mF cm−2).

The small Tafel slope of Ni1.35Sn_RT (69 mV dec−1) indicates the excellent HER activity because of the electron and mass transfer on the active sites. In controversy to the Tafel mechanism for Pt (29.1 mV dec−1), the Ni2−xSn catalyst exhibits intermediate Tafel values (Volmer and Heyrovsky), which supports the spillover mechanism.156 The Nyquist plot reveals that Ni2−xSn shows meager CT resistance and lowest CT resistance in Ni1.5Sn_RT (110.5 Ω), which confirmed the excellent HER performance due to rapid electron transfer kinetics.157 Among the three orthorhombic phases, Ni1.35Sn_RT exhibited high electrochemical activity and Ni1.5Sn_RT showed maximum stability (1000 cycles) and stability for 150 h with no change in the current density. Therefore, Ni1.5Sn_HT is the most active and stable HER catalyst due to its exceptional crystallographic structure and fast charge transfer kinetics.158
4.4. PBA-derived metal oxides
PBA-based metal oxides have been established as efficient catalysts for OER;159–163 compared to solid catalysts (closed-packed morphology), porous structured catalysts are highly beneficial due to abundant active surface area and inner hollow structure. Metal doping was the potential strategy to enhance the efficiency of the catalysts because additional metals assisted CT and tuned the electronic configuration to regulate the binding energy. Paik et al. reported Co3O4 microframes (etching 3 min), Co–Co PBA microcubes formed, and voids formed inside of Co–Co PBA microcubes (etching 5 min), whereas increasing the etching time to 10 min led to increased internal voids of Co–Co PBA and the formation of Co–Co PBA microframes.159 The well-structured Co3O4 microframes (600 °C: 2 h of Co–Co PBA microframes) exhibit an overpotential of 370 mV@10 mA cm−2 and show outstanding durability. The improved catalytic activity was ascribed to the porous geometry, which increased the active sites/surface area.
Lou et al. reported Ni–Co oxide (etching leads to the conversion of Ni–Co PBA cubes to a hollow structure, followed by carbonization under air, resulting in Ni–Co oxide nanocages), which exhibited better OER activity (380 mV).160 Yoon et al. reported mesoporous NiO/NiFe2O4 with hollow nanocages (formed from Ni–Fe PBA nanocube).161 NiO/NiFe2O4 exhibited 303 mV because the mesoporous/hollow architecture of NiO/NiFe2O4 increased the surface area and enhanced the contact of the electrolyte with the electrocatalyst. Zhang et al. reported that CoFe2O4 (carbonization of Co–Fe PBA yielded CoFe2O4) exhibits 266 mV with outstanding durability due to porous morphology with enriched redox behavior of the metal, which assisted the effective contact of the catalyst with the electrolyte.162 The highly active Fe–NiO (synthesized from Ni–Fe PBA/Ni(OH)2) exhibited excellent electrocatalytic activity (overpotential 218 mV@10 mA cm−2 and 270 mV@100 mA cm−2, Tafel slope 47 mV dec−1, and TOF 0.0334 s−1) and stability (over 50 h) for OER.163 The efficient performance of Fe–NiO nanosheet arrays reveal that the nanosheets were tightly bonded to the substrate; hence, the conductivity and efficiency were improved. The porous nanosheet reduced the agglomeration, increased the surface area, and assisted the contact of the electrolyte with the catalyst. Fe incorporation boosted the CT and regulated the structure to optimize the binding energy, which enhanced the activity of the Fe–NiO catalyst.
5. Metal complexes
Transition metal complexes (first row) supported in polymer membranes (Nafion) have also been reported as an efficient water oxidation catalyst. Najafpour et al. reported efficient heterogeneous water oxidation catalyst; the mononuclear Mn(II) complex consists of 4-bis(2,2′:6,2′′-terpyridin-4′-yl)benzene synthesized by the hydrothermal method, which exhibited a TON of 37 s−1,164 whereas the dinuclear Mn complexes [(tpy)(H2O)MnIII(μ-O)2MnIV(tpy)(OH2)]3+ adsorbed on kaolin clay exhibited a TON of 13.5 s−1.165,166 The clay support arrested the complex decomposition to MnO4−, which resulted in enhanced activity in heterogeneous medium.165 The tris(2-pyridyl)methane-based dinuclear complex [Mn2III(-O)(tpdm)2(-OAc)2]2+/K-10 clay oxidized water effectively. Kurz et al. carried out water oxidation in acidic media with an oxidant, which is practically unfavorable.166–172
The utility of electrochemical methods with Mn-based catalysts in Nafion porous carbon monolith (PCM) for water oxidation have been demonstrated.167,170,171 A tetranuclear Mn cluster with diaryl phosphinate as the ligand [Mn4O4L6]+ was used for water oxidation, its insolubility in water was solved by the ion-exchange process (cubium into Nafion layer), followed by deposition on various electrodes.169,172 Hydrophilic channels were formed when Nafion film was used, which are wrinkled by sulfonate groups, and the charges were balanced by H+ and Na+ counter ions; this methodology has been used in fuel cells.169,170,173 Catalysis by cubium-exchanged Nafion film (modified electrode: 1.0 V: visible light illumination) exhibited turnover rates of 0.075 s−1 during 65 h operation.169,170
Cubium in NF incorporated with dye-sensitized TiO2 anode could be driven with sunlight in water oxidation [RuII(bpy)2(bpy(COO)2)-sensitizer and Ru(III)-oxidant (1.4 V)]. To fabricate the device, TiO2 deposited on FTO and sensitized with RuII dye with cubium-doped Nafion deposition water oxidation catalyst [Ru(bpy)2(bpy(COO)2)]+ (1.4 V vs. NHE) was formed, which exhibited low efficiency (0.05%) and low stability.174–177 The water oxidation mechanism by [Mn4O4L6]+/Nafion was investigated by XAS and TEM.178 The cluster dissociated to the Mn(II) state and re-oxidized to the MnOx birnessite phase (stable under acid), and cycling between the reduced Mn(II) state and oxidized MnOx was attributed to water oxidation.179 The visible light irradiation of Mn precursors, [(bpy)2Mn(μ-O)2Mn(bpy)2]3+ and Mn2+(aq), generated the photocurrent when doped in Nafion.178 These precursors also generated the birnessite phase, which drove the water oxidation; these results are in agreement with Kurz et al.180 Crabtree et al. reported [(tpy)(H2O)MnIII(μ-O)2MnIV(tpy)(H2O)]3+/TiO2 for water oxidation; EPR studies reveal that the MnIII/MnIV dimer converted to the MnIV/MnIV dimer, which is stable in TiO2. Oxygen evolution by this complex in the presence of CAN reveal that the complex adsorbed on TiO2 (amorphous) and TiO2 (crystalline) becomes inactive and active, respectively.181
Artero et al. demonstrated the attachment of molecular oxidation catalysts to conduct carbon nanotubes/graphene/substrates. The utility of this approach for HER reveals that the robust catalytic system (covalent attachment of diamine–dioxime cobalt complex with carbon nanotubes) produced H2 (55000 turnovers at 350 mV).182 By presenting excellent results, water oxidation by this approach remains largely unexplored apart from few non-first row TM catalysts.183Table 1 displayed the efficiency of electrocatalysts for HER, OER, and overall water splitting.
Dong et al. reported low-cost transition metal ion (TMI)-doped polymers (Fe(III)-PANI/NF and Co(II)-PPy/NF) as high-performance electrocatalysts for HER or OER. DFT studies reveal that Fe(III)-PANI and Co(II)-PPy (OER and HER) lowered the energy barrier of both intermediates as well as products, and electrocatalytic active centers (EAC) have been accelerated by N and C atoms of PANI and PPy. The natural bond orbital (NBO) charge density distribution in PANI and PPy indicates that N and C atoms (near N atoms) are negatively and positively charged, respectively, and the different electronegative values induced the formation of EAC for OER and HER. The energy barrier of the intermediates and products on PANI for OER and PPy for HER were much lower than that of NF without the electrocatalysts.183 Based on DFT results, the free energies of the intermediates over transition metal oxide (TMO) surfaces have been compared to the Mn cluster in photosystem II (Fig. 10). In spite of different environments in the enzyme system and inorganic catalyst, the thermochemical features of the catalysts were compared; though both RuO2 and Mn cluster in photosystem II are close, the biological catalyst was found to be the best.184,185 The efficiency of robust electrocatalysts has been compared in Table 1.186–226

6. Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs)
Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) have been exploited as promising multifunctional electrocatalysts due to high specific surface area, various morphological structures, tunable pore channels, easy tuning of compositions, and capability as precursors (Table 1). MOF electrocatalysts for HER rely on metallic (Ni, Fe, Co, Mn, and Mo) catalytic active sites. Polyoxometalate MOF (POMOF):3D-(TBA)3[3-PMo8Mo4O36(OH)4Zn4][[C6H3(COO)3]4/3·6H2O] show higher HER activity (pH 1) than platinum. Qin et al. explored stable POMOF [TBA]3[3-PMo8Mo4O36(OH)4-Zn4][BTB]4/3·xGuest (NENU-500, BTB-benzenetribenzoate), which exhibits higher HER performance (onset overpotential 180 mV, Tafel slope 96 mV dec−1, and overpotential 237 mV) than other MOFs (NENU-5, NENU-499, NENU-501, and HKUST-1) but lower than Pt/C (Tafel slope 30 mV dec−1 and overpotential 52 mV).227 Cobalt–dithiolene or selenolate-based MOF (1D or 2D structures forming thin film on GC) is an efficient electrocatalyst for HER.228–231 The 2D BHT-Co and THT-Co (BHT-benzene-hexathiolate and THT-triphenylene-2,3,6,7,10,11-hexathiolate) show overpotentials of 340 and 530 mV and Tafel slopes of 149 and 189 mV dec−1, respectively.228 The combined effect of active cobalt-dithiolene sites, high conductivity, and strong binding to GC may be the reason for the excellent performances.232 Single-layer nanosheets of THTA-Co, THTA-Ni, and THT-Co with catalytic centers of CoS2N2, NiS2N2, and CoS4 show an overpotential of 283, 315, and 323 mV and a Tafel slope of 71, 76, and 82 mV dec−1, respectively. DFT (Gibbs free energy-) analysis reveals that the CoS2N2 active site shows the lowest , which is prone to HER.233,234
Wu et al. designed polymorphic Co-MOFs (CTGU-5 anionic surfactant and CTGU-6 neutral surfactant) having 2D or 3D structures.235,236 The 2D CTGU-5 exhibits higher electrocatalytic performance for HER than 3D CTGU-6 due to more access to cobalt sites. Also, the composite based on acetylene black (AB) and CTGU-5 (1:4) exhibited durable HER performance with a smaller onset potential (18 mV), lower Tafel slope (45 mV dec−1), and higher exchange current density (8.6 × 10−4 A cm−2). DFT calculations reveal that the higher efficiency of CTGU-5 may be attributed to unpaired electron as well as the empty Eg state of the Co site. Zhou et al. reported 3D Co-MOF [Co1.5(HTTAB)0.5(4,4′-bipy)(H2O)] (CTGU-9): HTTAB (3,4,5-tricarboxylic-(3′,4′,5′-tricarboxylazophenyl) benzene) and bipy (4,4′-bipyridine) ligands composited with AB for HER. The AB and CTGU-9 (3:4) composite shows efficient HER performance (overpotential 128 mV @ 10 mA cm−2 and a small Tafel slope 87 mV dec−1) and long-term stability (21 h).
Multifunctional MOF with 3d (Co, Ni, Fe, Mn, and Cu) and non-3d (V, Mo, W, Ru, and Ir) transition metals have been explored for OER. Wang et al. reported cobalt-containing zeolitic imidazolate (Co-ZIF-9) as an efficient water oxidation catalyst.237 DFT analysis reveals that the binding of the OH group to metal sites (low activation barriers) eliminated the proton, which is accepted by the benzimidazolate group. Li et al. reported that CUMS-ZIF-67 shows the best performances (low overpotential 320 mV @10 mA cm−2 and a smaller Tafel slope 54 mV dec−1) than the pristine one (400 mV, 75 mV dec−1).238 The high OER activity of CUMS-ZIF-67 may be due to the ligand knocked out from the Co sites, while Co ions bear positive charges and interact with oxygen, which assisted the adsorption of O2, O, OH, OOH and leads to abundant active sites. The Fe/Co bimetallic PBA (FeCo-PBA) permits the reactive oxygen to replace the coordinated H2O molecules of Co sites and exhibit a low overpotential of 274 mV @10 mA cm−2, a small Tafel slope of 53 mV dec−1, and stability over 16 h, which is superior than that of the pristine (334 mV, 67 mV dec−1).239
Ultrathin Ni–CoMOF nanosheets (NiCo-UMOFNs) with four metal coordination layers exhibit a low overpotential of 250 mV than bulkNi/Co-UMOFNs and commercial RuO2 (OER), and the higher activity may be attributed to the active centers and enhanced coupling between Co and Ni. The 2D NiFe MOF nanosheets (NiFe-UMNs) show excellent activity with a low overpotential of 260 mV and a small Tafel slope of 30 mV dec−1 compared to CoFe-UMNs, bulk NiFe–MOFs, and commercial IrO2 and RuO2.240 The high OER activity may be attributed to abundant surface and addition of Fe, changing the optimization of eg-orbit-filling of Ni and Fe.
Lan et al. reported bimetal MOF (NNU-21–24) based on Fe2M (Fe2M: M = Fe, Co, Ni, Zn) and biphenyl-3,4′,5-tricarboxylic acid ligand (BPTC).241 Among isostructural MOF, bimetallic Fe2Ni-BPTC (NNU-23) exhibit efficient OER performance with an overpotential of 365 mV, which exceeded the monometallic MOF and other MOF-based OER electrocatalysts. DFT analysis reveals that additional metal into Fe-based MOF NNU makes the d-band center, which is close to the Fermi level, and the stronger binding interaction between the adsorbates and catalysts enhanced the OER process. The binder-free MIL-53(FeNi)/NF showed superior OER activity with an overpotential of 233 mV@ 50 mA cm−2, Tafel slope of 31.3 mV dec−1, and excellent durability. The Fe coupling to MIL-53 plays a key role in boosting the OER performance by increasing the reaction sites, which accelerates the electron transportation. The 2D Co–NS grown onto Fe-doped NF (Fe: 2D-Co–NS@Ni) exhibits a small overpotential of 211 mV, low Tafel slope of 46 mV dec−1, and long-term stability over 96 h.242
7. Photocatalysts for solar-driven overall water splitting
The two-stage excitation systems in photosystem I and photosystem II in green plants and Z-scheme overall splitting is an attempt to duplicate natural photosynthesis, which includes H2- and O2-evolution photocatalyst together with the shuttle redox mediator.243–245 The reduction of H+ (electrons generated in CB) and oxidation of mediators (VB holes) leads to H2-evolution photocatalyst. Also, in the O2-evolution photocatalyst side, the oxidized mediator converted back to reduced form and O2 was generated due to H2O oxidation by holes. The overall water splitting was completed with a full cycle, and the Z-scheme photocatalytic process relaxed the stringent band gap need for photocatalytic materials. The carrier migration, charge separation, and surface catalytic reactions in one-step excitation water splitting by a single photocatalyst was applicable to Z-scheme water splitting by dual photocatalysts.
The one-step excitation overall water splitting under UV irradiation have been widely studied, and these oxide photocatalysts was classified into two families based on configuration (TM cations with d0 – Zr4+, Ti4+, Nb5+, W6+, and Ta5+: d10 – In3+, Sn4+, Ge4+, Ga3+, and Sb5+).246,247 Photocatalysts with d0/d10 configuration (La–NaTaO3 and Zn–Ga2O3) exhibit high photocatalytic performances during overall water splitting (UV region)247 and SrTiO3 shows high activity (near-UV).248,249 However, UV light (400 nm) accounts for 4% of the total solar energy and the theoretical maximum STH becomes 3.3% (UV light and 100% quantum yield), which is inadequate for practical solar hydrogen production. Visible-light photocatalysts (WO3, BiVO4, and Fe2O3) are excluded in one-step excitation overall water splitting.
The bimetallic co-catalyst (Ni/NiO core–shell) was formed via the impregnation technique, followed by H2 and O2 treatment;250 Rh/Cr2O3 core–shell and Rh2−xCrxO3 were synthesized by photodeposition251 and impregnation approach,252 respectively. Rh/Cr2O3 and Rh2−xCrxO3 prevents the evolved O2 to reach the metal surface and limits the water formation. The photodeposition/impregnation process damaged the surface of the non-oxide photocatalyst.253,254 The two-step photoexcitation overall water splitting was carried out with Pt-loaded TiO2 (A) and non-loaded TiO2 (R) in the presence of IO3−/I− shuttle redox mediator,255 where H2 and O2 evolved on Pt-loaded TiO2 (A) and non-loaded TiO2 (R), respectively. Various narrow-band gap semiconductors (Rh-CaTaO2N, TaON, Sm2Ti2S2O5, SrTiO3, H4Nb6O17, and g-C3N4,) as H2-evolution photocatalysts and (WO3, AgNbO3, BiVO4, Rh, Sb-TiO2, Ta3N5, and TaON) as O2-evolution photocatalysts (UV region) have been widely reported.256–258 The I, Co, Fe, and Mn-based redox couples were studied in the Z-scheme water splitting system, which assisted electron transfer from the O2-evolution photocatalyst to the H2-evolution photocatalyst.257,258
8. Photovoltaic–electrocatalytic (PV–EC) activity
Solar energy is found to be the most abundant source for power generation and direct production of H2 by solar energy via PV–EC water splitting, which is the potential route of energy conversion as well as storage.269 The low-cost PV–EC water splitting device was fabricated using CoNi LDH/CoFe2O4 (anode) and CoFe2O4 (cathode) with Si solar cell (Fig. 11). The Si solar cell (Voc of 2.4 V and Jsc of 200 mA) harvests a high energy conversion efficiency of 14.75% under sunlight (100 mW cm−2). The solar cell applied a constant potential (∼1.9 V) under sunlight irradiation, and continuous hydrogen and oxygen gas bubbles (ratio of 2:1) appeared on the anode and cathode, respectively.
 Fig. 11  (A) Two electrodes set up with solar panel and multimeter; (B) two electrodes set up and multimeter; (C) I–V curve of commercial Si solar cell; (D) H2 and O2 generation rates of FeCoNi LDH/Ni–CoFe2O4‖CoFe2O4 overall water splitting processes; (E) STH conversion efficiency of FeCoNi LDH/Ni–CoFe2O4‖CoFe2O4 overall water splitting in every 30 m; (F) charge transport and EC overall water splitting mechanisms over CoNi LDH/CoFe2O4‖CoFe2O4 samples.

The STH conversion efficiency was calculated using the following equation185  where rH2 is the average PV–EC H2 production rate (every 30 min), ΔG0 is the Gibbs energy (2.37 × 105 J mol−1), Ptotal is the input of natural solar energy (fluctuate to about 50–60 mW cm−2 at noon), and S is the effective Si solar cell surface area. The highest PV–EC STH efficiency under natural sunlight irradiation reaches 12.74%; hence, this potential strategy can be utilized for practical large-scale STH generation.
9. Disadvantages
Although great improvement has been made on overall water splitting, several problems still remain for practical applications in OER and HER.
(i) DFT results have been employed as a tool to identify the nature of intermediates; however, in composite catalysts, the real active sites were unclear. Hence, increasing the active sites and activity of each active site in the electrode becomes important strategies to enhance the catalytic activity.
(ii) The overall water splitting in alkaline/acidic media may assist the polarization of catalysts. To encourage the academic research findings in commercialization, the corrosion of catalysts needs to be prevented to enhance the activity and stability. Hence, strategies including coating, encapsulating, and anchoring might be employed for mitigating the polarization of the electrode, corrosion, and structural collapse in the electrolyte during water splitting.
(iii) Although efficient catalysts have been fabricated, a gap for progress beyond the laboratory atmosphere exists. Therefore, necessary steps should be undertaken for the commercialization of low-cost active electrocatalysts.
(iv) Non-noble metal-based electrocatalysts used in water splitting works well in alkaline/or near neutral conditions; corrosion resistance is the primary requirement for efficient catalysts in acidic conditions.
(v) Apart from transition metal oxides, metal sulfides, and metal phosphides are corrosion-resistant in acid, and their hybrid composites become preferred.
10. Challenges in water splitting
For both OER and HER, deep exploration is required to replace high-cost noble metal catalysts with non-noble metal catalysts. However, low-cost non-noble electrocatalysts have several challenges.
• Insufficient electrical conductivity of transition metal-based electrocatalyst for OER and HER.
• Insufficient exposure of non-noble metal catalysts in strong pH.
• Increased development of bifunctional electrocatalysts has become challenging due to a complex synthetic strategy.
11. Potential research directions
Besides the complications of emerging new catalysts for efficient OER and HER, there are many strategies that exist for producing efficient catalysts.
• The execution of cost-effective methodology for emerging efficient non-noble metal-based electrocatalysts for OER and HER (cheap, abundant active surface area, which promotes fast reaction kinetics).
• The appropriate catalytic mechanism of TM-based electrocatalysts is expected to be established for OER and HER. Theoretical calculation should thoroughly establish the catalyst effect.
• The wide investigation of non-noble metal-based electrocatalysts in neutral/acidic media have been required.
• These recommendations will overcome the existing problems in future research using advanced techniques.
12. Conclusion
Herein, we reviewed the advancement in water oxidation catalysis using efficient electrocatalysts. Water electrolysis is a vital technique for H2 production to meet the energy crisis; hence, a race in efforts and breakthroughs for developing efficient electrocatalysts is the prime objectives in the present scenario. Among the non-noble metal = based catalysts including metal hydroxides, chalcogenides, metal oxides, borides, metal phosphides, metal carbides, and metal nitrides, some of them show superior catalytic efficiency to the benchmark noble metal-based catalysts. Although significant progress has been made, detailed mechanism is required for practical applications. The optimized strategies on active sites, excellent activities, and performances have been highlighted, such as engineering the morphology of the electrocatalyst to expose more active sites; heterostructures/interfaces are required to synergistically increase the water splitting efficiency; multimetal and defect engineering are needed to be employed to tune the electronic configuration and using conducting supports to enhance the transportation of electrons and ions to improve the electrical conductivity. Finally, hybrid strategies will be recommended for efficient water splitting for commercialization. High corrosion resistance in acidic media is the main requirement for engineering the electrocatalysts. Apart from transition metals and its oxides, noble metals and metal phosphides/sulfides are the corrosion-resistant catalysts in acid. Therefore, it is suggested that their hybrid composites could be beneficial for efficient water splitting in acidic conditions. Rational strategies could be beneficial for mitigating the polarization of the electrode. Although high-performance HER, OER, and overall water splitting catalysts have been fabricated, there is still scope for improvement beyond the laboratory. Therefore, it is urgent to develop cost-effective and efficient electrocatalysts for commercialization. Therefore, it is also recommended that advancement in coating, encapsulating, anchoring, etc., is needed to mitigate the corrosion and structural collapse in the electrolyte during water oxidation (Fig. 12).
