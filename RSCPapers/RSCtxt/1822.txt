    , Accepted 31st August 2018First published on 31st August 2018AbstractThe poor oxidative stability of tin-based perovskites has been an obstacle to their widespread implementation in high-performance solar cells. Herein, quasi-two-dimensional (quasi-2D) tin-based perovskite solar cells are fabricated with significantly improved performance and stability, by introducing an additional formamidinium thiocyanate (FASCN) additive into quasi-2D tin-based perovskites. The incorporation of the FASCN additive greatly prevents quasi-2D tin-based perovskites from oxidation during film formation, through strong chemical interactions with the tin component (Sn2+). Moreover, it results in a coarser perovskite grain and a higher degree of crystallinity in the out-of-plane direction, leading to enhanced optoelectronic performance of quasi-2D tin-based perovskites. The best-performing tin-based perovskite solar cell shows an efficiency of 8.17% under reverse scan with a steady-state efficiency of 7.84% at a maximum power point (MPP), while retaining over 90% of its initial efficiency after 1000 hours in a glovebox filled with nitrogen. These results demonstrate a versatile, yet simple methodology that can be applied to other lead-free perovskites suffering from poor oxidative stability.
Introduction
Organic–inorganic hybrid lead-based perovskite solar cells have shown tremendous growth in power conversion efficiency (PCE) over recent years,1–4 due to their outstanding optoelectronic properties such as high absorption coefficient, long diffusion length, and low defect density.5–10 Despite remarkable strides in performance, one of the biggest barriers to their commercialization is the toxicity of lead. In this regard, efforts to develop lead-free perovskite solar cells have been made by utilizing IVA group ions such as Sn2+ and Ge2+ or VA group ions such as Bi3+ and Sb3+, or by implementing halide double perovskites.11–14 Among these candidates, tin-based perovskites are being regarded as promising alternatives due to their lower toxicity and excellent optoelectronic properties.11,15 Moreover, their narrower optical band gap (1.2–1.4 eV) is closer to the optimum value represented by the Shockley–Queisser limit (1.34 eV), making tin-based perovskites more ideal light absorbers for solar cells and other optoelectronic devices, such as photodetectors and light-emitting diodes operating in the near infrared region.16–18 Nevertheless, tin-based solar cells have not yet attained performance levels comparable to those of lead-based perovskite solar cells because of the strong oxidative tendency of Sn2+ to form Sn4+, which induces an unintentional self-p-doping in tin-based perovskites, leading to the shorting of solar cell devices even in a nitrogen-filled glovebox. Therefore, many efforts have been devoted to reducing the extent of tin oxidation.19–36
Recently, several efficient approaches have been explored to improve the device performance of tin-based perovskite solar cells, i.e., (1) implementation of mixed halide or cation tin-based perovskites,22,23 (2) introduction of a sequential deposition route,24 and (3) fabrication of quasi-two-dimensional (quasi-2D) or hollow-structured tin-based perovskites.27–32 In particular, remarkable improvements in performance and stability have been achieved through the structural modification of three-dimensional (3D) into quasi-2D tin-based perovskite structures by introducing hydrophobic long alkyl chain cations.29–31,33 G. Kanatzidis and co-workers firstly reported quasi-2D tin-based perovskite solar cells by fabricating 2D Ruddlesden–Popper (CH3(CH2)3NH3)2(CH3NH3)n−1SnnI3n+1 perovskites, where n is the number of the tin iodide octahedral stacks confined by long organic spacers. The fabricated quasi-2D Sn3I10 (n = 3) and Sn4I13 (n = 4) perovskite solar cells exhibited much improved stability compared to 3D methylammonium tin iodide (MASnI3) perovskite solar cells despite slightly low efficiency below 3% of PCE.29 Later, Z. Ning and co-workers reported quasi-2D tin-based perovskites by introducing phenethylammonium iodide (PEAI) into 3D formamidinium tin iodide (FASnI3) perovskites, achieving a PCE of 5.94% with 20% stoichiometric ratio of PEAI to formamidinium iodide (FAI).30 Further, M. A. Loi and co-workers extended their studies to quasi-2D tin-based perovskites with a relatively lower stoichiometric ratio of PEAI to FAI and achieved a PCE as high as 9%.31
The implementation of quasi-2D tin-based perovskites provides an efficient methodology to minimize the extent of oxidation by passivating easily oxidizable tin-based perovskites from moisture, leading to significantly improved performance and stability of tin-based perovskite solar cells. However, quasi-2D tin-based perovskites still suffer from poor oxidative stability and rapid increases in carrier density, which eventually result in the loss of their intrinsic semiconducting properties. In addition, recent efforts employing quasi-2D tin-based perovskites have been focused on merely tuning the stoichiometric ratio of PEAI to FAI from a structural point of view. Therefore, essential strategies that take into account tin chemistry are required to mitigate the intrinsic instability and improve the performance of tin-based perovskite solar cells along with the methodology from a structural point of view. Based on the chemical nature of tin, N-, S-, and O-based electron donors can coordinate with tin halides (SnX2, X = halide anions) by donating a lone pair electron to the empty orbital in the valence shell of divalent tin.37–41 Accordingly, it is expected that coordination between Sn2+ ions and appropriate ligands could block the reaction of Sn2+ ions with oxygen, resulting in effective suppression of the oxidation of Sn2+ to Sn4+.
Taking this into account, herein we fabricated quasi-2D tin-based perovskite solar cells by introducing the formamidinium thiocyanate (FASCN) additive into quasi-2D tin-based perovskites and investigated the effects of the FASCN additive on the performance and stability of quasi-2D tin-based perovskite solar cells. We found that the thiocyanate anion (SCN−) could coordinate with the vacant orbital of Sn2+, thereby possibly shielding the tin ion and suppressing oxidation of Sn2+ to Sn4+ oxidation during film formation. This effect resulted in both improved stability and better optoelectronic performance. Moreover, excellent morphological improvement with addition of the FASCN additive was observed simultaneously. Thus, the quasi-2D tin-based perovskite solar cells exhibited greatly enhanced photovoltaic performance and stability due to both chemical and morphological effects, attaining a PCE as high as 8.17% under reverse scan with a steady-state efficiency of 7.84% at a maximum power point (MPP) in comparison with that of 3D FASnI3 (PCE ∼1.84%), while retaining over 90% of their initial PCE after 1000 hours in a nitrogen-filled glovebox (H2O < 2.2 ppm, O2 < 5 ppm). We propose the method described herein as an effective means of improving the efficiency and stability of lead-free, tin-based perovskite solar cells through the simple introduction of the FASCN additive.
Experimental
Materials
Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS, PVP Al 4083) was purchased from Heraeus Clevios. Tin iodide (SnI2) was purchased from Alfa Aesar. FAI, PEAI, and FASCN were purchased from GreatCell Solar. Tin fluoride (SnF2), anhydrous N,N-dimethyl formamide (DMF), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), chlorobenzene (CB), and toluene were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. 6,6-Phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PC60BM) was obtained from EM-index. All chemicals were used without further purification as received.
Device fabrication
Indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glasses were sonicated sequentially in soapy water, de-ionized water, acetone and isopropyl alcohol. Cleaned substrates were treated with UV-generated ozone for 20 min. A PEDOT:PSS dispersion was filtered and then spin-coated onto the ITO substrates at 5000 rpm for 40 s and dried at 150 °C for 30 min. The coated ITO/PEDOT:PSS substrates were transferred to a nitrogen-filled glovebox (H2O < 2.2 ppm, O2 < 5 ppm). Quasi-2D tin-based perovskite precursor solutions with different stoichiometric ratios of PEAI to FAI were prepared by dissolving SnI2, FAI, PEAI, and SnF2 with the molar ratio of 1:(1 − x):x:0.1 in a DMF:DMSO solvent (8:2 volume ratio). The concentration of the precursor solution was 0.6 M. Quasi-2D tin-based perovskite precursor solutions containing FASCN were prepared by adding the FASCN additive to the perovskite precursor with different proportions of FASCN to SnI2. The perovskite precursor solution was spin-coated under two-step coating conditions of 1000 rpm for 10 s and 5000 rpm for 30 s, and then annealed at 100 °C for 30 min. Toluene was used as the antisolvent for the second spin-coating process. The PC60BM solution (20 mg ml−1) in CB was filtered and spin-coated onto the perovskite film at 2000 rpm for 60 s. Then, a 100 nm thick Al layer was thermally evaporated under vacuum (<10−6 mbar) through a shadow mask. The active area of the device was 0.12 cm2.
Film and device characterization
Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy (VERTEX 70; Bruker) was performed on prepared solutions with a spectral range of 4000 to 500 cm−1. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (ESCALAB 250) was performed on prepared perovskite films after etching for 20 s. X-ray diffraction (XRD) diffractograms were obtained using an X-ray diffractometer (D8 Advance; Bruker) with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å) at 40 kV/40 mA. Grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurements were performed at the PLS-II 3C SAXS I beamline of Pohang Accelerator Laboratory in Korea. X-rays from the in-vacuum undulator (IVU) were selected (Ek = 9.81 keV and λ = 1.26 Å) using a Si (111) double crystal monochromator. The GIWAXS patterns were recorded using a 2D charge-coupled device (CCD) detector (SX165; Rayonix), and the X-ray irradiation time was 1–6 s depending on the saturation level of the detector. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were obtained using a Hitachi cold SEM microscope. Absorption spectra were measured using a UV-Vis-NIR spectrophotometer (Cary 5000; Agilent). Steady-state and time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) spectra were measured using a cavity-dumped Ti:sapphire laser. The excitation pulse was 4.5 nJ at a wavelength of 415 nm, which was doubled to 830 nm (380 kHz, 20 fs). The PL signal was collected by a 25.4 mm parabolic mirror and dispersed by a grating monochromator (SP-300; Acton Research) with a pitch of 150 g mm−1. Steady-state PL spectra were recorded using a CCD (DV-420; Andor). Time-resolved PL spectra were measured by time-correlated single-photon counting using a fast silicon avalanche photodiode (Id100; ID Quantique SA) as the detector. Photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves and solar cell performance were measured using a Keithley 2400 Source Meter with an AM 1.5G solar simulator (100 mW cm−2). Current–voltage (I–V) curves of electron-only devices for extracting trap densities were measured at forward bias ranging from 0 V to 1.5 V using a Keithley 2400 Source Meter under dark conditions. Capacitance–voltage (C–V) measurements were carried out in the dark at voltages ranging between −0.5 V and 0.5 V at a constant frequency of 10 kHz and an AC amplitude of 20 mA. Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were measured using an IviumStat at a forward bias under AM 1.5G illumination (100 mW cm−2) and frequencies ranging between 100 Hz and 1 MHz with an AC amplitude of 10 mA. Z-view software was used for Nyquist fitting.
Results and discussion
Preparation of quasi-2D tin-based perovskite solar cells
We first prepared quasi-2D tin-based perovskite precursor solutions with different PEAI molar percentages of 0% (FASnI3), 3%, 5%, 10%, and 20% by mixing SnI2, FAI, PEAI, and SnF2 at a molar ratio of 1:(1 − x):x:0.1 in a DMF:DMSO solvent (8:2 volume ratio). Perovskite films were fabricated with a solvent engineering approach using anti-solvent dropping. Structural effects of the PEAI spacer on the FASnI3 film were determined by XRD analyses (Fig. S1†). The film yielded diffraction peaks at 14.1°, 24.2°, 28.2°, 31.6°, 40.5°, and 43.2°, which were ascribed to the (100), (120)/(102), (200), (122), (222), and (300) planes, respectively, representing an orthorhombic phase structure having a random crystallographic phase with various orientation planes. Notably, with the incorporation of PEAI, the diffraction peaks corresponding to the (100) and (200) lattice planes were largely enhanced, while those corresponding to the (120), (122), and (222) planes were drastically suppressed. The suppression of (120), (122), and (222) planes by preferential (h00) planes indicates that the vertical growth of the 3D FASnI3 crystal was confined by the PEAI spacer to a parallel growth, resulting in a quasi-2D crystal structure with a preferential orientation with respect to the substrate.42,43 The GIWAXS analyses were conducted to further investigate the crystal orientation of these quasi-2D tin-based perovskites (Fig. S2†). The FASnI3 film exhibited a completely isotropic intensity distribution, represented by Debye–Scherrer rings, implying a random crystal orientation. In contrast, distinct Bragg spots were observed with increasing proportions of PEAI, where the (100) peak appeared strongly along the qz direction and the (011) and (022) peaks appeared along the qy direction. These data imply that the crystal orientation was such that the (100) plane was parallel to the substrate.29–31 This oriented structure could facilitate charge transport in the vertical direction because charge transfer would not be disturbed by the insulating PEAI spacer. Compared to the FASnI3 film, a smoother surface morphology was observed with the controlled orientation facilitated by the introduction of PEAI (Fig. S3†). An optimized quasi-2D tin-based perovskite solar cell with an inverted planar structure on ITO-coated glass with PEDOT:PSS as the hole transporting layer, FASnI3 with 20% molar ratio of PEAI to FAI as the absorber, PC60BM as the electron transporting layer, and Al as the metal electrode yielded a PCE of 5.07%, showing a comparable performance level with the previously reported quasi-2D tin-based perovskite solar cell.30 The highest PCE of 5.74% in quasi-2D tin-based perovskite solar cells was obtained under reverse scan with 10% PEAI (Fig. S4 and Table S1†), which is the reference cell in this study.
Study on the effects of the FASCN additive on quasi-2D tin-based perovskites
Further improvements in the performance and stability of quasi-2D tin-based perovskite solar cells were attained using the FASCN additive. To investigate the effect of the FASCN additive on tin components, SnI2 solutions were prepared with different additive compositions in a DMF:DMSO (8:2 volume ratio) solvent and stored in air (Fig. 1a). Before exposure to air (0 min), the color of the solutions containing the SnF2 compensator (10 mol%) was slightly brighter than that of those lacking SnF2. This indicates that SnF2 can act as an antioxidant.19,26 Once exposed to air, all of the solutions turned dark red, beginning at the surface, due to the oxidation of Sn2+ ions. Interestingly, in the first 8 minutes of aging, the rate of discoloration of a solution containing only the FASCN additive (5 mol%) without SnF2 was slightly lower than that of a solution containing neither SnF2 nor the FASCN additive. This indicates the suppression of tin oxidation by the FASCN additive. With assistance of the FASCN additive, the solution containing both SnF2 and the FASCN additive showed the slowest degradation rate as shown in 8–20 min. The effect of the FASCN additive on the rate of oxidation was more clearly observed in solutions containing relatively higher concentrations of FASCN, even without SnF2 (Fig. S5†). These results suggest that the FASCN additive interacts strongly with the tin component of the perovskite precursor solution to effectively suppress the oxidation of Sn2+ ions. For spectroscopic confirmation of this interaction, FTIR spectroscopy was conducted on prepared DMF:DMSO solutions containing FASCN, FASCN + SnI2, FASCN + SnI2 + SnF2, and FASCN + SnI2 + SnF2 + FAI + PEAI (Fig. 1b). The vibrational peak corresponding to the CN stretching vibration of SCN− was clearly observed at 2055 cm−1 with pure FASCN in a DMF:DMSO solvent.44–46 This peak red-shifted to 2043 cm−1 with the incorporation of SnI2, and to 2040 cm−1 with the incorporation of SnF2 (Fig. 1c). It has been shown that the empty orbital in the valence shell of SnX2 functions as an electron acceptor for electron-donating (O-, S-, or N-based) ligands.37–41 Accordingly, the gradual red-shift of the SCN vibrational peak is due to the partial donation of a lone pair electron from the sulfur atom of the SCN group to a vacant orbital of tin, forming an SnX2–donor complex. The same peak was shifted to a slightly higher wavenumber of 2044 cm−1 with the incorporation of FAI and PEAI. This is due to the donation of a partial electron cloud from the N-donor groups of FAI and PEAI to SCN, which had become relatively electronic-deficient as a result of its interaction with tin. The formation of a coordination complex between SnX2 and the FASCN additive was also confirmed by XRD analyses (Fig. S6†). The SnI2 film lost its intrinsically preferred crystalline phase, a high-temperature yellow β-SnI2 phase, and adopted a randomly oriented α-SnI2 phase with hardly traceable intensity after the incorporation of the FASCN additive.47,48 The XPS analysis (Fig. 1d–e) was used to investigate the effects of the strong interaction between the FASCN additive and tin on the extent of oxidation in the resulting perovskite films. The Sn (3d) band can be deconvoluted into two peaks at 486.6 and 487.4 eV, associated with Sn2+ and Sn4+, respectively.49 The XPS spectra indicate that the 10% PEAI film with the FASCN additive contained much less Sn4+ than those without the FASCN additive. These results explicitly imply that the FASCN additive extensively suppresses the oxidation of Sn2+ to Sn4+ by forming a complex with the tin component in the precursor solution, which could act as a shield to prevent Sn2+ from reacting with oxygen, thereby preventing tin precursors from oxidation during film fabrication.

Fig. 2a shows a GIWAXS image of the 10% PEAI film with the FASCN additive. Compared to the 10% PEAI film without the FASCN additive (Fig. S2†), more distinct and clear Bragg spots were observed, implying enhanced crystal orientation with respect to the direction parallel to the substrate, and its schematic crystal structure is given in Fig. 2b. The improved crystallinity in the out-of-plane direction can alleviate the interference in charge transport by the insulating organic spacers, which leads to an increase in the short circuit current (Jsc) of the final device. To investigate the improved crystallinity of the (h00) diffraction planes representing out-of-plane orientation, the XRD analysis of the 10% PEAI films with different amounts of FASCN was performed. Notably, sharper and stronger diffraction peaks corresponding to (h00) planes were observed with the addition of FASCN (Fig. 2c). Crystallographic enhancement due to the FASCN additive is evidenced by a decrease in the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the peaks corresponding to the (100) and (200) planes (Fig. 2d). This decrease indicates improved crystallinity with a more ordered crystal orientation.

The morphological effects of the FASCN additive on the 10% PEAI films were investigated using SEM (Fig. 3a–e). In the absence of the FASCN additive, the films exhibited some pinholes, which could potentially lead to direct contact between the electron transporting layer and hole transport layer, thereby impeding efficient charge transport and resulting in a decreased fill factor (FF) and poor device performance.50 As the FASCN additive was added, grain boundaries became clear and slightly enlarged grain sizes were observed, which are in agreement with the results of XRD analyses. The optimized film with 5 mol% FASCN additive showed a compact and uniform film coverage without pinholes. The enlargement of grain sizes with the addition of FASCN may be due to the coarsening of perovskite grains by FA gas, as in the case of methylamine (CH3NH2, MA) gas used in the lead-based perovskites where MA gas is known to enlarge the grain size.51–59 In our case, we infer that SCN− reacts with FA+ to generate FA gas and release HSCN gas, rather than being intercalated into the perovskite lattice. This is confirmed by the XPS spectrum for S (2p) core electrons in the tin-based perovskite film, which indicates no evidence for the presence of SCN− in the final film under the detection limit of XPS (Fig. S7†). To further investigate whether the SCN− worked as an additive or was doped into the quasi-2D tin-based perovskite in our case, we conducted time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS), which has a more delicate detection limit (parts per billion) compared with XPS, in order to detect the remaining amount of SCN− in the final film as shown in Fig. S8.† A very small amount of SCN− is expected to remain after annealing considering the detection limit of ToF-SIMS. Notably, the intensity of sulfur in the surface region was lower than that in the bulk region, implying that SCN− reacts with FA+ more easily in the surface region to generate FA gas, which is consistent with the result of the lead-based perovskite.57 In addition, because there is a loss of SCN− after annealing, it is not reasonable to conclude that SCN− penetrated into the lattice and formed a thermodynamically stable perovskite crystal. Furthermore, we could not observe any crystallographic or optical shift by lattice expansion which could occur if SCN− penetrated into the perovskite lattice,60,61 verifying the absence of doping effect in our case. Accordingly, the generation of FA gas may result in larger grains through the reconfiguration and healing of the initial perovskite grains in a similar way MA gas worked in lead-based perovskites.54 However, pinholes were gradually observed with excess FASCN, possibly due to large amounts of FA vapor being released at once. Overall, the incorporation of the FASCN additive not only produces a tin-based perovskite film which is less damaged by oxidation through chemical interactions, but also enhances morphological quality, leading to improved crystallinity.

Scale bar in all images indicates 2.5 μm. The inset in each image shows its corresponding magnified SEM image, where the scale bar in the inset indicates 1 μm. 

Fig. 4a and b show absorption, steady-state and time-resolved PL spectra of the 10% PEAI films with different amounts of the FASCN additive. The absorption spectra reveal that the optical band gap was not affected by the addition of PEAI or FASCN. The absorption onset occurs near 900 nm, similar to that of the 3D FASnI3 perovskite.19,26 This means that quantum confinement effects by the incorporation of PEAI are negligible for the 10% PEAI sample, as reported for quasi-2D lead-based perovskites with a similar molar percentage of PEAI.43,62,63 The PL intensity of tin-based perovskite films with the FASCN additive was strongest around 890 nm, while the reference cell yielded the lowest emission. Carrier lifetimes of the 10% PEAI films prepared with 0, 2.5, 5, 7.5, and 10 mol% FASCN additive were 1.91, 2.71, 6.40, 6.10, and 5.24 ns, respectively (Fig. 4b). These results imply that the incorporation of the FASCN additive facilitated the radiative recombination of photo-generated charges, while simultaneously inhibiting non-radiative recombination by reducing the defect density related to tin vacancies and improving film quality.

Photovoltaic properties of quasi-2D tin-based perovskite solar cells with the FASCN additive
The effects of the FASCN additive on the performance of quasi-2D tin-based perovskite solar cells are represented by average photovoltaic parameters and maximum PCEs obtained from the optimized 20 devices, including Jsc, open circuit voltage (Voc), FF, and PCE for each FASCN incorporation amount as shown in Table 1 and Fig. S9.† The reference cell yielded the lowest photovoltaic parameters, with an average PCE of 5.09% under reverse scan (Jsc = 18.5 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.48 V, and FF = 57.2%). The average Jsc, Voc, and FF of the device improved progressively with the addition of FASCN, reaching an optimized average PCE of 7.66% under reverse scan with 5 mol% FASCN additive (Jsc = 21.8 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.53 V, and FF = 66.5%). The improvements in Jsc, Voc, and FF in devices containing FASCN are due to the formation of chemically stable tin-based perovskite absorbers and morphological enhancements, which result in a reduced number of tin vacancy defects and improved charge transport properties, respectively. With the addition of excess FASCN, average Jsc, Voc, and FF gradually decreased, yielding an average PCE of 6.00% with 10 mol% FASCN. This is attributed to increasing pinhole size and correspondingly poor film coverage, implying that the decrease in FF is the primary reason for the degraded device performance with excess FASCN additive. Fig. 5a shows a cross-sectional SEM image of a fabricated device, including a 200 nm thick perovskite film with 40 nm PC60BM and 50 nm PEDOT:PSS, which act as electron- and hole-transporting layers, respectively. Fig. 5b displays the J–V curves of the best-performing tin-based device, which contained 5 mol% FASCN, and shows a Jsc of 22.5 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.53 V, FF of 68.3%, and PCE of 8.17%, while the best-performing reference cell shows a Jsc of 19.9 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.50 V, FF of 57.5%, and PCE of 5.74% under reverse scan. The obtained best efficiency presents the highest enhancement from the 3D FASnI3 device compared to other studies reporting similar performance levels for the 3D FASnI3 device (Table S3†). The reliability of the best-performing devices without or with the FASCN additive was confirmed by steady-state photocurrent measurements at their MPP for 150 s, displaying a stabilized PCE of 5.28% and 7.84%, respectively (Fig. S10†). Smaller hysteresis was observed with the FASCN additive for the optimized device compared to the reference cell, further demonstrating the reliability of the device (Fig. S11†). The J–V curves and photovoltaic parameters of the best-performing devices made with other proportions of FASCN are shown in Fig. S12 and Table S2,† respectively. Fig. 5c shows the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the optimized cell with or without the FASCN additive. The cell with FASCN showed a much higher EQE over the whole wavelength range and the Jsc, calculated from the EQE, matched well with the corresponding value obtained from the J–V curve. Fig. 5d shows the PCE distribution of 50 devices, indicating better reproducibility afforded by the FASCN additive. Stability tests were performed in a nitrogen-filled glove box (H2O < 2.2 ppm, O2 < 5 ppm) for 1000 hours as shown in Fig. 5e and S13.† The device containing the FASCN additive retained over 90% of its initial efficiency after 1000 hours. In contrast, the reference cell retained just 60% of its initial efficiency. The improved stability is attributed to the enhanced chemical stability of the tin-based perovskite against oxidation during film formation, and the suppressed penetration of oxygen and moisture into the perovskite film by morphological improvement. As shown in Fig. S14,† under ambient conditions with 40% relative humidity at room temperature, the FASCN-applied device showed greatly improved stability, retaining 40% of its initial efficiency after 30 min, while the reference one retained around 20%. To also examine the stability under continuous illumination, we monitored the PCEs of optimized devices for 15 hours under continuous 1 sun illumination at their MPP. As shown in Fig. S15,† the FASCN-applied device displayed enhanced stability under working conditions compared to the reference, showing a much slower decay in the PCE at the MPP. At the initial time, both devices exhibited steep decays. However, within a short time, the device with the FASCN additive showed gradual stabilization and a slow decay, while the reference device showed a fast decay trend at a similar rate to the initial. The slow decay rate implies that the FASCN-applied device is less sensitive to defect formation, which facilitates ion defect migration in bulk and accumulation at junction interfaces under continuous working conditions, deteriorating the steady-state efficiency.64,65 Consequently, these results clearly demonstrate improved defect tolerance in the FASCN-applied device. C–V measurements were performed to determine the charge density profile of our perovskite films (Fig. 5f). The slope of the C–V plot was used to extract charge carrier density using the Mott–Schottky equation as defined by eqn (1),66 (1)where ε is the dielectric constant of the perovskite film, ε0 is the permittivity of vacuum, A is the area of the electrode, e is the elementary electronic charge, Nd is the charge carrier density, Vfb is the flat band potential, kB is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature. A remarkable reduction in carrier density (6.67 × 1015 cm−3) was observed with the addition of 5 mol% FASCN compared to that of the reference cell (2.17 × 1016 cm−3). The carrier density decreased further with increasing proportions of FASCN additive (Fig. S16†), which indicates the effectiveness of FASCN in suppressing the oxidation of tin. This reduced carrier density with the FASCN additive was further confirmed by dark I–V curves, where the extracted shunt resistance (Rsh) showed a higher value (145.2 kΩ cm2) with the FASCN additive compared to that (16.32 kΩ cm2) without the FASCN additive (Fig. S17†). The higher Rsh implies a higher resistance to increasing carrier density due to the self-p-doping, which leads to low leakage current. The width of the depletion region, calculated from C–V measurements, is shown in Fig. 5f (top and right axes). The depletion region gradually broadened with increasing reverse voltage until fully depleted. In films containing FASCN, the fully depleted region at a reverse voltage of −5 V was 190 nm. Without FASCN, the depleted region was only 113 nm wide, indicating that a stronger field is formed with the FASCN additive. This, in turn, leads to better junction properties and facilitates the extraction or separation of photo-generated charges under light illumination. Dark I–V curves of electron-only devices were measured to determine the trap density of our perovskite films. The I–V plot in Fig. S18a† consists of a linear ohmic region at low voltages, a trap-filling region, where current increases sharply as empty trap states are filled, and a space charge-limited region that obeys the Mott–Gurney law. The voltage at the point where the trap begins to fill is represented by the trap-filled limit voltage (VTFL) and trap densities can be obtained by eqn (2),67 (2)where nt is the trap density and L is the film thickness. Trap density decreased from 1.87 × 1016 cm−3 in the reference cell to 9.36 × 1015 cm−3 in films containing 5 mol% FASCN (Fig. S18b†). This is attributed to a reduction in the number of tin vacancy defects and improved film quality. In contrast, excess FASCN led to an increase in trap density due to poor film coverage. Recombination resistance (Rrec) was extracted from EIS (Fig. S19a–e†) to verify the extent of charge recombination in our perovskite films. The resulting Nyquist plots featured a major arc in agreement with previous reports for tin-based perovskites22,35,68 and corresponding Rrec values were extracted as a function of applied forward voltage (Fig. S19f†). The optimized cell yielded the highest Rrec over the entire voltage range, thereby confirming the suppression of charge recombination.

Conclusions
In summary, we fabricated efficient, tin-based perovskite solar cells with over 8% efficiency using the FASCN additive in quasi-2D tin-based perovskites. The incorporation of the FASCN additive not only significantly suppressed the oxidation of tin-based perovskites via strong interaction with tin but also improved the crystallographic and morphological quality by creating coarser perovskite grains. These two effects resulted in significant enhancements in both device performance and stability. Our work demonstrates, for the first time, that thiocyanate-based additives can be effectively applied to tin-based perovskite solar cells, exerting a remarkable impact on the device performance and stability. We anticipate that this approach can be applied to other lead-free perovskite solar cells containing metal components prone to oxidation to realize significant improvements in device performance and stability.
