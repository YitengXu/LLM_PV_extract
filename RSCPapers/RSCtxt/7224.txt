    , Accepted 10th May 2015First published on 12th May 2015AbstractWe report a tree-like nanoporous tungsten trioxide (WO3) photoanode that largely improves the photoelectrochemical water oxidation performance. These novel WO3 photoanodes were prepared using a pulsed laser deposition method and their porosity was controlled by adjusting the oxygen partial pressure during the deposition process. The tree-like nanoporous WO3 photoanode has a nanoporous structure with a partially preferred alignment of the individual WO3 nanocrystals, which greatly improves the charge transport efficiency. Under simulated solar light illumination, the aforementioned features resulted in ∼9 times higher photocurrent density (1.8 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE) than a dense WO3 photoanode. An incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency of over 70% was also obtained at wavelengths of 350–400 nm.
Introduction
Direct solar-to-hydrogen conversion by photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting is an attractive technology for the generation of hydrogen as a renewable and carbon-free fuel. Research on PEC water splitting has spanned four decades since the seminal report by Fujishima and Honda in 1972 that described the successful photoelectrolysis of water using a TiO2 electrode.1 Since then, a number of semiconductor materials have been investigated for use in PEC cells. In particular, metal oxide semiconductors such as Fe2O3, BiVO4, and WO3, which have good chemical stability, have been widely studied as photoanodes.2–4 WO3 has a moderate band gap (∼2.7 eV) and it is preferred over Fe2O3 or BiVO4 as a photoanode material because of its good charge carrier transport properties (i.e., high electron mobility ∼10 cm2 V−1 s−1 and large hole diffusion length ∼150 nm).5–9 So far, there have been a number of studies on WO3 photoanodes to improve their PEC water-splitting performance.10–14 In particular, porous structured WO3 films prepared by sol–gel and anodization methods showed enhanced photoelectrochemical characteristics such as large surface area and good permeation of electrolytes, which in turn largely increase the PEC performance.12,14,15 Despite some advances, however, the PEC water splitting performance of the WO3 photoanode still needs to be improved because the generated photocurrent density is lower than the theoretically predicted value (∼4.5 mA cm−2).
Recent developments in nanotechnology for synthesizing nano-materials have triggered significant research interest in PEC water splitting owing to their controllable structure/morphology, and electronic and optical properties.16–18 Novel three-dimensional (3D) architectures comprising one-dimensional (1D) nanowires/nanorods or two-dimensional (2D) nanoplates received particular attention owing to their unique properties, namely (i) large surface area/active sites, (ii) high light scattering/absorption, (iii) open channels for infiltration of the electrolyte, and (iv) good charge transport within the nanowire or nanoplate trunk.19–27 In addition, the 3D architectures are beneficial for hetero-junctioning with other photoanode materials to improve the PEC performance further.28,29 Several methods based on two-step processes such as hydro/solvo-thermal, vapor–liquid–vapor (VLS), and electrospinning were developed to synthesize these 3D architectures.5,24,30–33 The 3D architectures can also be satisfactorily fabricated using a pulsed laser deposition (PLD) technique, which uses a high energy excimer laser to ablate the metal oxide target. This technique was used to synthesize 3D architectures of TiO2, i.e., quasi 1D nanostructures with hierarchically organized nanoparticles and pores23 for the application of dye-sensitized solar cells.34–37
In this work, PLD was used to synthesize a tree-like nanoporous WO3 photoanode by controlling the partial pressure of oxygen. This novel WO3 photoanode consisted of hierarchically organized and densely interconnected nanocrystals. The tree-like nanoporous WO3 photoanode was found to exhibit a nanoporous structure with a partially preferred alignment of individual WO3 nanocrystals. Most importantly, the resulting WO3 photoanode greatly improves the charge transport efficiency together with charge transfer efficiency resulting in a high photocurrent density which is 9 times higher than that of a dense WO3 photoanode produced by PEC water oxidation.
Results and discussion
During PLD, the high energy excimer laser ablates the WO3 target and creates a plasma plum, which is composed of the ablated species. Hierarchical nanostructures of metal oxides were prepared, using this PLD method, by tuning the kinetic energy of the ablated species, while controlling the experimental parameters such as oxygen partial pressure and working temperature.35 Based on the previous studies of TiO2,23,34–39 WO3 nanostructures with various densities and porosities are synthesized by controlling the oxygen partial pressure during the PLD deposition process. As shown in the SEM images (Fig. S1†), the oxygen partial pressure greatly affected the morphology of the WO3 photoanodes. For example, deposition at a low oxygen partial pressure of 50 mTorr resulted in a dense film. The porosity of the WO3 photoanode increases greatly, however, when the partial pressure is increased to 100–600 mTorr, a tree-like nanoporous structure is formed. The formation of this type of hierarchical nanostructure is due to an increase in the probability of collision between the ablated species and the oxygen molecules. These collisions reduce the kinetic energy of the ablated species and, therefore, eventually induce cluster scattering and self-assembly of the ablated species on the substrate.40–42 Since the as-prepared WO3 photoanodes have an amorphous phase (Fig. S1e†), further thermal annealing was conducted at 550 °C for 2 h in air for crystallization to the monoclinic phase. As shown in Fig. S2,† all the samples maintain the tree-like nanoporous morphology after annealing, albeit with the occurrence of slight grain growth, and the XRD peaks are indexed to the monoclinic WO3 (JCPDS #83-0950). It should be noted that although the WO3 photoanodes prepared at 300 and 600 mTorr maintain their nanoporous morphology, as shown in the SEM images, they exhibited loosely interconnected nanoparticles and often detached/crushed from the FTO substrate during PEC measurements, thus showing lower photocurrent density values.

Fig. 1a shows a representative SEM image of the synthesized WO3 photoanode which was deposited at an oxygen partial pressure of 100 mTorr (growth time = 45 min) and subsequently annealed at 550 °C for 2 h (denoted as W-100). It has a tree-like morphology with a one-dimensional (1-D) nanostructure feature (film thickness = 3.2 μm). In addition, the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image (Fig. 1b) clearly shows that an individual cluster consists of a number of nanosized open pores as well as densely interconnected, hierarchically organized WO3 nanocrystals, which have an average size of ∼60 nm. The average size of the nanocrystals was estimated from Scherrer's equation by using a (200) XRD peak at 24.4°; the results are summarized in Table S1.† The calculated size of the nanocrystals is approximately 57 nm, which is consistent with the value determined from TEM.

(a) A representative SEM image of the WO3 photoanode grown on the FTO substrate (annealed at 550 °C/2 h after pulsed laser deposition at an oxygen partial pressure of 100 mTorr, deposition time = 45 min, thickness = 3.2 μm) and (b) a TEM image of the nanoporous WO3 cluster. The inset shows a high-resolution TEM image in the rectangular region. 
The crystal structure and relative surface area of the W-100 photoanode (synthesized at 100 mTorr, thickness = 3.2 μm) were investigated by XRD and electrochemical capacitive–current measurements, respectively, and compared with those of its W-50 counterpart (synthesized at 50 mTorr, thickness = 3.2 μm). Fig. 2a shows typical XRD patterns of the W-50 and W-100 photoanodes. Both have a monoclinic WO3 crystal structure and peaks from impurity phases were not detected. Interestingly, the relative intensity of the (020) diffraction peak in the W-100 photoanode is much higher than that of the other peaks. This implies that the WO3 nanocrystals are partially aligned along the [020] direction, i.e., they exhibit a partially preferred orientation to the [010] direction. On the other hand, the higher relative intensity of the (002), (200), and (202) peaks than those of other planes in the W-50 photoanode implies that the W-50 film is partially aligned along the [101] direction. Therefore, it can be concluded that the oxygen partial pressure during PLD, using an excimer laser, influences both the morphology (i.e., porosity) and the crystal structure (i.e., alignment) of the WO3 photoanode.43,44 The relative electrochemical surface area of the W-100 photoanode was determined from the capacitive–current measurements using cyclic voltammograms (Fig. S4†).45–47 As shown in Fig. 2b, the nanoporosity of the W-100 photoanode results in a large increase in the specific surface area (∼15 times larger than that of the W-50), indicating a good permeation of the electrolyte into the open channels of the WO3 photoanode.22,47

As shown in Fig. S4,† the capacitive current was measured by using cyclic voltammograms with various scan rates in a 0.5 M phosphate buffer solution (pH 7.0). 
The optical properties of ∼3.2 μm-thick W-50 and W-100 photoanodes were measured for wavelengths in the range of 300–600 nm. These photoanodes were grown on 500 μm-thick quartz substrates in order to minimize the effect of the substrate on the measurements.48Fig. 3a–c compare the corresponding transmittance (T), reflectance (R), and absorption + scattering (=100 − T − R) spectra of the photoanodes. The transmittance and reflectance of the W-100 photoanode are about 20% lower than those of the W-50, owing to a strong light scattering effect by its tree-like nanostructure.20,36,49 Furthermore, although the W-50 and W-100 photoanodes have identical absorption edges, i.e., 460 nm (bandgap ∼2.7 eV), the latter absorbs more light than the former. This difference stems from the reduced transmittance and reflectance of the W-100, and indicates that this photoanode has a structural advantage for light absorption.

The photoelectrochemical (PEC) water oxidation performance of the WO3 photoanodes was evaluated using a standard three-electrode system under simulated solar-light illumination (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2). Fig. 4a shows the corresponding photocurrent density–potential (J–V) curves of the W-100 and W-50 photoanodes. The J–V curves of the other WO3 photoanodes, which were prepared at different oxygen partial pressures, are shown in Fig. S3.† Interestingly, the W-100 photoanode (prepared at 100 mTorr, 3.2 μm thick) exhibits significantly (8 times) higher saturation photocurrent density (Jsat = 2.3 mA cm−2 at ∼2.0 VRHE) than that of the W-50 (3.2 μm thick, Jsat = 0.3 mA cm−2 at ∼2.0 VRHE). Furthermore, at 1.23 VRHE, which is generally used as a reference potential for comparison, the W-100 photoanode shows 9 times higher photocurrent density (1.8 mA cm−2) than the W-50 photoanode (0.2 mA cm−2), demonstrating that the tree-like nanoporous WO3 photoanode has an excellent photoelectrochemical water oxidation performance. The PEC performance of our W-100 photoanode was further compared to the previously reported WO3 photoanodes with various nanostructures (Fig. S5†). Although the W-100 shows larger onset potential than the others, it shows the highest photocurrent density at 1.23 VRHE. The significantly higher photocurrent density of the W-100 photoanode, compared to that of W-50, stems from its structural features, i.e., tree-like morphology and nanoporosity, which enable effective permeation of the electrolyte through the open channels. This effective permeation, in turn, minimizes the hole transport distance to the surface.3,12,15,22,47 In addition, the external quantum efficiencies of these photoanodes were quantitatively compared by performing incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) measurements at a potential of 1.23 VRHE (Fig. 4b). Compared to the W-50 photoanode, the IPCEs of the W-100 were considerably higher over the entire range of wavelengths below the band edge (∼460 nm). The photocurrent densities at 1.23 VRHE were calculated by integrating the IPCE spectra with a standard AM 1.5G solar spectrum (ASTM G-173-03), and were found to be 0.15 and 1.62 mA cm−2 for the W-50 and W-100 photoanodes, respectively. These values are quite similar to those obtained (0.2 and 1.8 mA cm−2) from the J–V curve. This result indicates that the solar simulator is well-matched to the AM 1.5G light spectrum and the resulting J–V measurements are, therefore, reliable. Moreover, IPCEs are, in general, expressed as the product of three factors, namely, the (1) light absorption efficiency (ηabs), (2) charge transfer efficiency (ηtransfer), and (3) charge transport efficiency (ηtransport); i.e.:50IPCE = ηabs × ηtransfer × ηtransport

As previously shown in Fig. 3, the W-100 photoanode absorbs ∼20% more light than the W-50. However, this difference in light absorption does not explain the significantly (9 times) higher photocurrent density value of the former compared to the latter. To understand the large improvement in the PEC performance, a hole scavenger method was used to obtain ηtransfer and ηtransport by adding hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) or sodium sulfate (Na2SO3) to the electrolyte (Fig. S6†).33,50–52Fig. 5a and b show the estimated ηtransfer and ηtransport as a function of the applied potential. At a potential of 1.23 VRHE, the W-100 photoanode has a ηtransfer of 78%, which is slightly higher than that (70%) of the W-50. The higher ηtransfer of the W-100 photoanode indicates that the nanoporous structure contributes to reducing surface electron–hole recombination by increasing the area of the depletion layer and shortening the hole diffusion distance to the WO3/electrolyte interface.22,52 Owing to the significantly larger surface of the W-100 compared to that of the W-50, correspondingly large differences between the ηtransfer values were expected. The relatively small (∼10%) difference obtained suggests that, compared to the W-50, the W-100 photoanode has lower surface catalytic reactivity due to different exposed facets which limits further increase of the ηtransfer.53

(c) Schematic illustration of charge transport/transfer processes in W-50 and W-100 photoanodes. The hierarchical nanoporous WO3 photoanode has enhanced charge transport (or separation) and transfer efficiencies due to the open structure as well as partial orientation alignment. 
There are, however, significant differences between the transport efficiency, ηtransport, values. With a value of 78% at 1.23 VRHE, ηtransport of the W-100 photoanode is approximately 9 times higher than that of the W-50 (9%). The enhanced ηtransport of the W-100 results from an increase in the electron and hole transport owing to a reduction in bulk recombination, which is facilitated by its crystal structure and nanoporous features. As shown previously in Fig. 2a, the WO3 nanocrystals in the W-100 have different partial-orientation alignments from those of their W-50 counterparts; i.e., [010] for W-100 vs. [101] for W-50, which might affect the electron mobility and hence, the electron transport properties.2 Moreover, the nanoporous feature of the W-100 photoanode enables easy permeation of the electrolyte into the photoanode, thereby resulting in a hole diffusion distance that is lower than its hole diffusion length (∼150 nm). Fig. 5c illustrates the effectiveness of the W-100 photoanode with tree-like nanostructure and nanoporosity for electron and hole transport. Compared to the W-50 photoanode, the nanoporous structure in the W-100 enables intimate contact between the electrolyte and the photoanode surface, even at the bottom. This results in shorter hole diffusion distances to the electrolyte and efficient electron/hole separation. In addition, the partial alignment of the WO3 nanocrystals aids electron transport to the FTO without a large recombination loss.54 Therefore, although the light absorption, charge transfer and transport efficiencies simultaneously contribute, the improved PEC water-oxidation performance in the W-100 photoanode is largely attributed to the efficient electron and hole transport/separation due to its unique morphology.
Finally, the stability of the W-100 photoanode was tested for 1 h by measuring the photocurrent–time (J–t) curves in both phosphate buffer (pH ∼7) and sulfuric acid (pH ∼0.2) electrolytes. As shown in Fig. 6, the W-100 photoanode retains its high photocurrent density after 1 h operation (∼18% degradation) in both electrolytes, indicating that the W-100 photoanode is somewhat stable in both acidic and neutral electrolytes at least for 1 h. The faradaic efficiency of the W-100 photoanode for O2 production was in the range of 55–65% for 1 h (Fig. S7†).

In summary, a tree-like nanoporous WO3 photoanode has been prepared by a pulsed laser deposition method through the control of oxygen partial pressure. Compared to a dense WO3 photoanode, the tree-like nanoporous WO3 photoanode exhibited a partially preferred orientation to the [010] direction, a large surface area, and an enhanced optical absorption. As it relates to the photoelectrochemical water oxidation reaction, the tree-like nanoporous WO3 photoanode exhibited a much higher photocurrent density, 1.8 mA cm−2 at 1.23 VRHE, than the dense WO3 photoanode. This significantly higher photocurrent density results from the greatly improved charge transport properties of the nanoporous feature with a partially preferred orientation. In light of the significant improvement in the charge transport efficiency, nanoporous photoanodes, prepared via pulsed laser deposition, which have a partially preferred orientation feature, should enable further improvement of the photoelectrochemical water oxidation performance by applying other metal oxides and heterojunction structures.
Experimental section
Preparation of the WO3 photoanode
WO3 photoanodes with porous nanostructures were prepared on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO, Pilkington, TEC8) or quartz substrates by a pulsed laser deposition (PLD) method (KrF excimer laser, 248 nm). The energy density of the laser beam was 1.5 J cm−2 and the pulse-repetition rate was set at 5 Hz. The WO3 target (∼2 in diameter) for the PLD was prepared from a pure WO3 (99.9%, High Purity Chemicals), pressed to a pellet, and sintered at 1000 °C for 10 h in air. The deposition of the WO3 photoanode was performed by controlling the oxygen partial pressure, which was set to 50, 100, 300, and 600 mTorr at room temperature in order to control the porosity of the WO3 photoanodes. The distance between the WO3 target and FTO substrate was fixed to 5 cm. The thickness of the films was adjusted by controlling the deposition time (typically, 30 min). The as-deposited WO3 photoanodes were crystallized by annealing at 550 °C for 2 h in air.
Characterization of samples
The morphology of the WO3 photoanode was observed by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, SU70, Hitachi) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM-2100F, JEOL). An X-ray diffractometer (XRD; D-8 Advanced, Bruker) was used to characterize the crystal structure. The optical properties of the samples were measured by using an ultraviolet-visible (UV-VIS) spectrophotometer (Cary 5000, Agilent Technologies) with an integrating sphere. The reflectance (R) and transmittance (T) spectra were obtained by air reference from 300 to 600 nm. The sum of absorption (A) and scattering (S) was calculated using the formula A + S = 100 − T − R and plotted as a function of the wavelength.
Photoelectrochemical and electrochemical measurements
The PEC performance of the photoanodes was measured using a potentiostat (CHI 608C, CH Instruments) in a three-electrode system with the WO3 photoanode as a working electrode, a Pt wire as a counter electrode, and a 3 M NaCl saturated Ag/AgCl electrode as a reference electrode under simulated solar light illumination (AM 1.5, 100 mW cm−2, PEC-L11, Percell). The light power was calibrated using a reference cell certified by the National Renewable Energy Laboratories (Model 91150V, Newport, USA). Furthermore, 0.5 M phosphate buffer solution (pH 7) and 0.5 M H2SO4 (pH ∼0.2) were used as electrolytes after being purged by highly pure argon (99.999%) to remove the dissolved oxygen. The RHE potential was calculated using the following equation:VRHE = VAgCl + 0.059pH + EAgCl°EAgCl°(3 M NaCl) = 0.209 V at 25 °C
The relative surface areas of the WO3 photoanodes were obtained by capacitive current measurements in the potential range of −0.05–0.15 V vs. Ag/AgCl (→0.57–0.77 V vs. RHE), where all current is only attributed to capacitive charging due to the absence of any redox features under dark conditions by using a phosphate buffer solution under dark conditions. We also assumed that the intrinsic specific surface capacitance of all WO3 films is approximately the same.55 The scan rates were varied from 25 to 300 mV s−1. Moreover, the relative active surface area of the sample was obtained from the slope of the capacitive current vs. scan rate curve. The IPCEs were measured at 1.23 VRHE in a three-electrode system. A 1000 W Xe lamp equipped with a monochromator (CM-110, 1/8, SP Spectra Product) was used to generate a monochromatic beam. The incident light intensity was calibrated using a standard silicon photodiode. In addition, H2O2 or Na2SO3 was added to the electrolyte solution as a hole scavenger in order to obtain the charge transfer and transport efficiencies.3,51

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  Morphology of the tree-like nanoporous WO3 photoanode. (a) A representative SEM image of the WO3 photoanode grown on the FTO substrate (annealed at 550 °C/2 h after pulsed laser deposition at an oxygen partial pressure of 100 mTorr, deposition time = 45 min, thickness = 3.2 μm) and (b) a TEM image of the nanoporous WO3 cluster. The inset shows a high-resolution TEM image in the rectangular region.	 

 	Fig. 2  Crystal structure and relative surface area of the nanoporous WO3 photoanode. (a) XRD pattern of the W-100 and W-50 photoanodes (film thickness = 3.2 μm) and (b) plot of the linear relationship between the capacitive current and scan rate of the W-100 and W-50 photoanodes. As shown in Fig. S4,† the capacitive current was measured by using cyclic voltammograms with various scan rates in a 0.5 M phosphate buffer solution (pH 7.0).	 

 	Fig. 3  Optical properties of W-100 and W-50 films grown on quartz substrates (film thickness = 3.2 μm). (a) Transmittance, (b) reflectance and (c) light absorption plus scattering (A + S = 100 − R − T).	 
IPCE = ηabs × ηtransfer × ηtransport

 	Fig. 4  Photoelectrochemical water oxidation performance of the W-100 and W-50 WO3 photoanodes (thickness = 3.2 μm). (a) Photocurrent density-potential (J–V) curves measured in a 0.5 M phosphate buffer solution (pH 7.0) under simulated solar light illumination (AM1.5G, 100 mW cm−2) and (b) incident photon-to-current conversion efficiencies (IPCEs) measured at 1.23 VRHE (=0.608 VAg/AgCl) in a 0.5 M phosphate buffer solution (pH 7.0).	 

 	Fig. 5  Evaluation of (a) charge transfer and (b) separation/transport efficiencies. The dotted line indicates 1.23 VRHE. (c) Schematic illustration of charge transport/transfer processes in W-50 and W-100 photoanodes. The hierarchical nanoporous WO3 photoanode has enhanced charge transport (or separation) and transfer efficiencies due to the open structure as well as partial orientation alignment.	 

 	Fig. 6  Photocurrent–time (J–t) curves of the W-100 photoanode measured at 1.23 V vs. RHE in 0.5 M phosphate buffer solution (pH 7.0) and 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte (pH ∼0.2) under simulated solar light illumination (AM1.5G, 100 mW cm−2).	 
VRHE = VAgCl + 0.059pH + EAgCl°
EAgCl°(3 M NaCl) = 0.209 V at 25 °C
