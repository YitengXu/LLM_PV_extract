    , Accepted 27th November 2019First published on 27th November 2019AbstractAlthough perovskites have been proven to exhibit extraordinary performance in solar cell applications, the potential of perovskites in photocatalysis is yet to be fully explored. In particular, the unique properties of perovskite materials including chemical and optical stabilities, tunable bandgaps and crystal structures, long charge carrier lifetime and favorable band alignment make them a potential next generation photocatalyst. Considering that, a perspective on the state-of-the-art developments in perovskite-based photocatalysts and the modification strategies, i.e. defect engineering, doping or co-doping with metals or non-metals, sensitization, and facet control, is timely. This paper details perovskite-based photocatalysts for artificial photosynthesis, namely photocatalytic carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction and water splitting. In this perspective, perovskites are divided into four groups based on the B site element, namely titanates, tantalates, niobates and ferrites. The synthesis parameters and factors affecting the efficiency of photocatalysts are discussed. Finally, this perspective outlines the recent development of perovskite-based photocatalysts and the immense prospects that it presents when an appropriate modification technique is employed.
Introduction
In recent years, global warming has become one of the greatest threats that the world has to face. The primary reason for global warming is the increased emission of greenhouse gases (GHG), mainly carbon dioxide (CO2), into the atmosphere from both natural and anthropogenic resources. It is worrying that the increase in CO2 concentration has shown an upward trend over the past 40 years as shown in Fig. 1. On the 15th of May 2019, the average CO2 concentration has reached an all-time high record of 415.70 ppm.1
 Fig. 1  Global CO2 concentration in the atmosphere since year 2000.1 
Human activities, such as deforestation and burning of fossil fuels, which include petroleum, coal, and natural gas, release a huge amount of CO2 which adds to the greenhouse effect. CO2 emissions account for 76.7% of GHG with 74.0% from the use of fossil fuels.2 As concerns about the finite amount of fossil fuels emerge, alternative energy supply is more sought after. Hence, advancements in the renewable energy sector are crucial. Attempts to directly harness the power of the sun have been made over the decades with solar panels or photovoltaic cells. However, recent advances in nanotechnology have opened up the possibility of mimicking natural photosynthesis, where engineered nanomaterials are used to convert photons into useable energy. Among the various classes of materials explored for artificial photosynthesis, one of the more promising candidates is perovskite-based materials due to their long charge carrier lifetime and diffusion length, adequate chemical stability, easily tunable properties and structural flexibility.3 Calcium titanium oxide mineral, CaTiO3, was first discovered in 1839, by a German scientist, Gustav Rose in the Ural Mountains of Russia.4 The mineral was then named “perovskite”, in honour of Lev Perovski, the founder of the Russian Geographical Society. Perovskite has attracted extensive attention since its first breakthrough in 2009 for its use as a photovoltaic component in solar cells.5 From 2009 to 2018, the efficiency of perovskite in single-junction architectures for solar cell devices has increased dramatically from 3.8% to 23.3%, which makes perovskite one of the fastest growing solar technologies to date.5–8
In general, the perovskite family is a class of compounds with a chemical formula of ABX3. In this structure, the A-site is usually occupied by a larger size cation whereas the B site is occupied by a smaller size cation. The X site holds an anion that bonds to both A and B as illustrated in Fig. 2.

The B cation and X anion form a BX6 octahedron, with the A cations occupying the 12 coordinated voids within the structure to balance the charges of the entire system. An ideal perovskite structure is cubic and inflexible from a crystallographic perspective.10 However, most perovskites are usually distorted. In 1926, Goldschmidt proposed that the formation of a perovskite structure can be governed by a tolerance factor, t.11 For an ideal cubic structure, t = 1.0. (1)where t is the tolerance factor and rA, rB and rX are the radii for the corresponding ions.11
Depending on the elements that are used in the structure, perovskites can have a vast range of interesting properties, such as chemical and optical stability, corrosion resistance, moderate bandgap energy for catalytic properties, and unique crystal structures. Due to its immense potential, extensive efforts have been made by researchers on perovskite material as a photocatalyst. As shown in Fig. 3, an upward trend of the number of publications based on perovskite photocatalysts was observed from 2008 to 2019.

Both water splitting and CO2 reduction systems are important components of artificial photosynthesis. Upon light irradiation, perovskite photocatalysts will absorb photon energy from sunlight. When the energy absorbed is equal to or larger than the bandgap of the perovskite, the electrons from its valence band (VB) will be excited to the conduction band (CB), resulting in the formation of electron–hole pairs. These photoexcited electron–hole pairs will migrate to the surface of the perovskite photocatalyst to undergo oxidation and reduction reactions, respectively. In the water splitting process, water molecules will lose their electrons at the surface of the photocatalyst, producing oxygen and hydrogen ions as depicted in (Table 1) eqn (2). Simultaneously, the as-produced hydrogen ions will accept the photo-excited electrons from the photocatalyst, resulting in the formation of hydrogen molecules as shown in eqn (3). Similarly, for CO2 reduction, a transfer of electrons from the CB to the adsorbed CO2 molecule on the photocatalyst surface results in the formation of an anionic radical, ˙CO2−, as shown in eqn (4). The radical initiates succeeding chemical reactions for CO2 reduction to various hydrocarbon fuels as shown in eqn (5)–eqn (9).12

Although a number of review papers targeting perovskite compounds and their derivatives have been published over the last decade, least attention has been paid to the use of perovskite-based photocatalysts for artificial photosynthesis.13–15 Although Kanhere and Chen16 reviewed the visible light driven applications of perovskite-based photocatalysts back in 2014, there are no further updates to highlight the recent advancements in perovskite-based photocatalysts for various applications. Besides, Huang et al.17 and Arandiyan et al.18 reported a general review on the applications of nanoporous perovskite metal oxides, whereas Stolarczyk et al.19 focused on the challenges and prospects. However, there is still a lack of a comprehensive review on perovskite-based photocatalysts used in artificial photosynthesis, which includes both photocatalytic water splitting and CO2 reduction.
Till date, a large variety of single perovskite compounds have been reported for artificial photosynthesis.20–22 They are classified based on the B-site cations, namely titanates, tantalates, niobates and ferrites. Fig. 4 shows the band edge potentials of ABO3 photocatalysts against the redox potentials of water splitting and CO2 reduction. The photocatalyst preparation, optical properties, morphologies, and the photocatalytic performance of perovskite materials will be discussed in detail. Finally, a summary on the recent advances in perovskite photocatalysts will be given.

Titanates
Titanate perovskites have a general chemical formula of MTiO3, where M = Ca, Sr, Ba, etc. A majority of titanates have bandgaps larger than 3 eV, which limits them to only possess photocatalytic properties under ultraviolet (UV) light illumination.23 This radiation range only accounts for approximately 5% of the solar spectrum resulting in a very low efficiency in utilizing solar light. Hence, many researchers have experimented various modifications on titanates to extend their spectral absorption to the visible light range which takes up approximately 45% of the solar spectrum.24 Some of these titanate perovskites have appropriate conduction band (CB) and valence band (VB) potentials that make them suitable for artificial photosynthesis reactions.
Titanates have many unique properties, such as high thermal stability and good corrosion resistance. Among the various titanate perovskites, strontium titanate, SrTiO3, has been widely studied due to its excellent physical properties as an n-type semiconductor. SrTiO3 has a simple cubic perovskite structure with a space group of Pm3m and an indirect bandgap of 3.1–3.3 eV.23,25,26 The VB of SrTiO3 is composed of O 2p, Sr 5s, and Ti 3d hybrid orbitals while the CB consists of the Ti 3d orbital.27 The first observation of a photosynthetic reaction from the reduction of CO2 to methane (CH4) was made by Hemminger et al.28 in 1978. A clean single crystal surface of (111) orientation was used in contact with platinum (Pt) foil in the experiment to study the role and importance of bandgap illumination and its effect on regeneration of Ti3+ after the oxidation reaction in water.28 Since then, many researchers have investigated the properties of SrTiO3 in an effort to improve its photocatalytic performance in artificial photosynthesis. Surface properties like the surface structure and crystallite size are important factors, which affect the performance of a photocatalyst.
Luo et al.29 investigated the correlation between the chemical surface structure of SrTiO3 and its corresponding photocatalytic CO2 reduction activity. The SrO-terminated surface is basic in nature which facilitates CO2 fixation. The TiO2-terminated surface, on the other hand, is acidic. The electronic properties of these two surfaces differ significantly, where the CB level of the Sr 4d orbital is more negative compared to the CB level of the Ti 3d orbital, which gives rise to a higher reductive capacity in the SrO-terminated surface as illustrated in Fig. 5. The results in this experiment demonstrated that surface-Ti-rich SrTiO3 possessed the highest CO2 reduction ability with a CO yield of 26.4 μmol g−1 as the absorption edge of the catalyst shifted towards the visible light region as compared to Sr(OH)2-decorated SrTiO3, where the surface species are attached to weakly active Sr ions resulting in lower reactivity.29

Synthesis parameters, such as calcination temperature as well as precursor concentration, play pivotal roles in deciding the photocatalytic performance of perovskites. Moniruddin et al.30 demonstrated that the particle size of SrTiO3 nanostructures increases with increasing calcination temperature from 600 to 800 °C. As the temperature increases, the H2 production rate increases. However, the size of SrTiO3 decreases with increasing precursor (strontium titanate alkoxide (DSRT) in ethanol) concentration from 3.03 to 15.78 vol%. At a fixed calcination temperature of 800 °C, the H2 production rate decreases with increasing precursor concentration. The authors concluded the ideal conditions to be 5.88 vol% precursor concentration and 800 °C calcination temperature, resulting in a crystallite size of 81.6 nm in the (110) plane. Furthermore, the authors also showed that the SrTiO3 nanofibers synthesized exhibited a two times higher H2 evolution rate compared to commercial SrTiO3 nanoparticles after Pt addition.30
Despite the many unique characteristics of SrTiO3, the wide optical bandgap that it possesses limits its light harvesting capability, leaving a majority of the solar light energy unutilized. Therefore, it is vital for researchers to investigate different approaches to enhance the photocatalytic ability of SrTiO3 such as through modulating its bandgap to utilize a wider range of the solar spectrum. For example, defect engineering or selective doping to narrow the bandgap of SrTiO3 has received great attention lately. Xie et al.31 created self-doped SrTiO3 by a carbon-free one-step combustion method and a heat treatment process ranging from 1200–1400 °C. By treating the samples in argon, Ti3+ ions and oxygen (O2) vacancies were introduced into the lattice which aids in the recovery of artificial photosynthesis performance. O2 vacancies serve as a sacrificial agent to activate the water molecules required for artificial photosynthesis. Although the experimental bandgap obtained was 3.2 eV, the authors were able to show that these O2 deficiency-related defects tend to promote chemical adsorption for heterogenous CO2 reduction under visible light by inducing an in-gap band. The in-gap band formed allows photoexcitation from the defect band to the CB within the visible light range. For an artificial photosynthesis reaction with gaseous CO2/H2O under visible light irradiation, CH4 was obtained as the main product with a yield of 0.25 μmol mcatalyst−2 h−1. The quantum efficiency (QE) was calculated to be 0.21%.31
Calcium titanate, CaTiO3, with a bandgap ranging from 3.06–3.60 eV, straddles the reduction and oxidation potentials of artificial photosynthesis reactions as seen in Fig. 4.32–34 Calcium, an alkaline earth metal, is a reactive metal that can be used to absorb CO2 and form carbonates. It is very commonly used for carbon capture and storage (CCS).35 Hence, researchers have been trying to understand the relationship between the Ca:Ti ratio of the CaTiO3 perovskite and its photocatalytic activity.36,37 As the concentration of Ti in the catalyst increases, the interaction between CO2 molecules with the catalyst surface increases. However, Kwak and Kang36 demonstrated that an excess of titanium will prevent the synergistic effect between Ca and Ti. Furthermore, when CaTiO3 was coated on basalt fiber (BF) as a catalyst support, CaTiO3 (1.5:1) @BF exhibited a higher performance compared to CaTiO3 (1:1) @BF and CaTiO3 (2:1) @BF resulting in a CO generation of 73.1 μmol g−1 and a CH4 generation of 17.8 μmol g−1 from CO2 photoreduction in 8 hours under UV light illumination. This is because CaTiO3 (1.5:1) @BF had the highest amount of O2 vacancies on the (110) planes and appropriate bulk pores sizes which aided in CO2 facilitation.37 BF consists mostly of SiO2 with small amounts of CaO, Al2O3, and Fe2O3.38 BF could act as a photosensitizer to improve photocatalytic performance.37,39 Do et al.39 also experimented with PbTiO3 using the BF sensitizer for CO2 photoreduction. The composite had a narrowed bandgap of 1.92 eV and a specific surface area of 20.72 m2 g−1. The authors demonstrated that the presence of BF and PbTiO3 resulted in increased CO2 and H2O adsorption abilities. The synergistic effect of BF and PbTiO3 promotes the separation of electron–hole pairs, thus achieving higher CO2 reduction efficiency with a CH4 generation of 290 μmol g−1 L−1 after a 6 hour reaction under UV light irradiation.39
As mentioned previously, a broad spectrum of modifications, such as deposition of noble metals or doping, have been reported to narrow the bandgap of photocatalysts and thereby extend their photoresponse to the visible light region.40 It was interestingly discovered by Anzai et al.41 that an Ag-loaded CaTiO3 photocatalyst exhibited a higher CO generation rate and also higher selectivity towards CO formation. The authors proposed that the deposited Ag nanoparticles act as selective active sites for CO formation resulting in a decrease of active sites for H2 production via water splitting on the CaTiO3 surface.41 Apart from that, Wang et al.42 modified hollow CaTiO3 cubes by co-doping them with La and Cr with hopes of reducing their bandgap and improve their light absorption. The hollow cubes exhibited better photocatalytic activity than a standard one with Pt loading, despite the smaller surface area possessed by the former. This is mainly attributed to the increased photon–matter interactions as well as the shorter charge transfer pathways. As shown in Fig. 6a and Fig. 6b, the samples with La/Cr co-doping exhibited red shifting of the absorption edge along with bandgap narrowing to 2.48–2.50 eV in comparison to pristine CaTiO3 with a relatively large bandgap of 3.51 eV. The authors showed that the optimal doping point under full range illumination is 5% as shown in the H2 evolution rate in Fig. 6c and d which corresponds to an apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of ∼2.41%.42 Theoretical calculations were performed to confirm the critical role of Cr in reducing the bandgap of CaTiO3 as well as being responsible for the visible light photoactivity.

Another series of La/Cr co-doped perovskite compounds ATiO3, where A = Ca, Sr and Ba, were synthesized by a hydrothermal route to investigate the differences in physicochemical and optical properties and crystal structures.43Fig. 7 presents the refined crystal structures of the perovskite compounds. Severe structural distortions can be seen for Ca0.9La0.1Ti0.9Cr0.1O3 in Fig. 7a. Lu et al.43 revealed that a long Ti–O bond and deviation of the Ti–O–Ti bond angle away from 180° cause a decline in the catalytic performance as the visible light absorption deteriorates. Among the three compounds investigated, SrTiO3 possesses the shortest Ti–O bond length (d = 1.9526 Å) as shown in Fig. 7b and an appropriate Ti–O–Ti bond angle which ensures maximum overlapping between Ti 3d orbitals and O 2p orbitals leading to wide band dispersion as well as high charge mobility. The highest H2 generation belongs to Sr0.9La0.1Ti0.9Cr0.1O3 with an AQY of 0.07% under visible light illumination.43

A different approach was used to synthesize titanates for photocatalytic CO2 reduction to renewable hydrocarbon fuels. Zhou et al.44 used natural green leaves as a template to construct a 3D hierarchical structure of ATiO3 where A = Sr, Ca and Pb. The veins' porous network promotes gas diffusion and has a large surface area, thus enhancing overall performance. The authors believed that the intrinsic 3D architectured structure enhanced mass flow and light harvesting ability by transferring the captured light deeper into the 3D structure. Apart from that, the authors experimented with various cocatalysts, namely Au, Ag, Cu, Pt, RuO2 and NiOx. Among all these cocatalysts, Au exhibited the highest CH4 and CO evolution with 230 and 350 nmol g−1 h−1 respectively, followed by Ag and Cu under visible light illumination. Fig. 8 shows the graphical representation of a natural photosynthetic system (NPS) and an artificial photosynthetic system (APS).

Other titanates, including barium titanate, BaTiO3, and lanthanum titanate, LaTiO3, were also reported as perovskite photocatalysts that are suitable for water splitting applications.45–48 BaTiO3, with a bandgap of about 3.2 eV, was studied using first principles density functional theory (DFT) computations. Huang et al.46 investigated the optical and electronic properties of BaTiO3, an n-type semiconductor, by varying the concentrations of O2 group element dopants. The doped chalcogens, selenium (Se), tellurium (Te), and sulfur (S), significantly decrease the bandgap of BaTiO3 as shown in Fig. 9, thus enhancing visible light absorption of the catalyst. Zhong et al.47 synthesized CdSe quantum dot (QD) sensitized BaTiO3 nanocubes to investigate the effect of exposed crystal facets in a heterogeneous catalyst system on water splitting. CdSe QDs that were located on anisotropic (230) and (001) facets of 30-facet varietal cubic BaTiO3 exhibited higher photocatalytic performance compared to those on isotropic (001) facets of 6-facet cubic BaTiO3. This is attributed to the (230) facets, which provide electrons with a faster transfer channel.47 Dong et al.49 investigated the effect of changing reaction time, temperature and molar ratio of water to ethanol on the size and structure of CaTiO3. It was discovered that the CaTiO3 microspheres became more spherical and densely packed as the reaction time increases. The morphology changes from bulk to microspheres when the temperature was increased from 140 to 200 °C. CaTiO3 microspheres exhibited higher photocatalytic activity as compared to randomly aggregated nanosheets.49 This is mainly attributed to the stronger redox potential of CaTiO3 microspheres as well as the higher surface area. Hence, it can be concluded that the morphology and synergistic effect of exposed facets in a photocatalytic system are important factors which affect the photocatalytic performance of a material.47

Compared to BaTiO3, LaTiO3 has a larger bandgap of approximately 3.5 eV and was studied by doping nitrogen (N) to narrow the bandgap which resulted in a shift of the absorption band edge to the visible light solar spectrum.45 The N-doped LaTiO3 nanocomposite prepared by a sol–gel polymerized complex method was evaluated by performing a water splitting reaction under visible light irradiation. The authors also incorporated 2D graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) with a 2.7 eV bandgap into the N-doped LaTiO3 to form a g-C3N4/N–LaTiO3 (CLT) nanocomposite. The CLT exhibits two to four times higher catalytic performance compared to pure g-C3N4 and N–LaTiO3 due to the synergistic effect and better separation efficiency of photogenerated electron–hole pairs.45
Tantalates
Tantalate perovskites have appropriate positions of CB and VB energies, which are suitable for artificial photosynthesis reactions. With bandgaps of about 3.6–4.0 eV, tantalates are only reactive under UV irradiation and are incapable of harvesting the full range of the solar spectrum.50–52 Catalyst modifications are required to obtain a significant red shift in the absorption spectra that will extend the photoresponse to the visible light region. Solid-state reactions are often used to synthesize tantalates by treating alkali salts and tantalum pentoxide at high temperatures.53,54 However, this technique restricts the control of the crystallinity and size of particles.55 Therefore, a number of alternative methods are now more commonly employed for the synthesis of tantalate perovskites, such as the hydrothermal method,56–60 solvothermal method61,62 and polymerized complex method.63 Apart from that, alkali tantalates exhibit versatile properties in a wide spectrum.
Sodium tantalate, NaTaO3, is a distorted perovskite and has an orthorhombic structure with a space group of Pbnm at room temperature.64,65 Its monoclinic system leads to a Ta–O–Ta angle closer to 180°, which is more favourable for charge carrier delocalization.53 Li et al.66 obtained an experimental bandgap of 4.2 eV and showed that the use of cocatalysts, such as Ru and Pt, can significantly enhance the photoreduction of CO2 due to their excellent abilities in H2 activation. However, Pt poisoning from the produced CO deactivates the catalyst and causes a decay of CO evolution.66 Among the doped NaTaO3 systems, density functional theory (DFT) computations on S, Se and Te doping were reported by Liu et al.67 to investigate their photocatalytic performance in the visible light range. The bandgaps for doped NaTaO3 were reduced to 2.56–3.20 eV. Fig. 10a shows the doped structure of NaTaO3. DFT studies are useful in defining the band positions; in this case, the CBM and VBM of doped structures were determined to satisfy the requirement of water splitting. The lowest VB is mainly composed of O 2s states, whereas the top of the VB is made up of O 2p orbitals. The bottom of the CB consists mainly of Ta 5d orbitals, which is one of the primary advantages for using tantalate perovskites as they have a high reduction potential.53,68

Photocatalytic reactions are initiated by the interaction of photoexcited electron and hole carriers with chemical species on the catalyst surface. It is important to prolong the lifetime of these carriers to further improve the overall efficiency of photocatalysts. Jeyalakshmi et al.56 reported that cobalt(II) tetraphenylporphyrin (CoTPP) sensitization regulates the electronic structure in La modified NaTaO3, tuning the bandgap of the semiconductor from 4.1 eV to 3.76 eV. The NaTaO3 nanocubes showed no significant change in the crystal structure but a shift of the absorption edge towards the red region at 330 nm was observed.56Fig. 10b shows the schematic of CO2 reduction on the COTPP sensitized catalyst. The composite simultaneously absorbs both UV and visible light, resulting in excitation of electrons from the VB to the CB. Moreover, sensitization also reduces the charge carrier recombination process and the composite was proven to be chemically stable after 20 hours of irradiation, hence improving photocatalytic activity.56
On the other hand, lithium tantalate, LiTaO3, has an O2 octahedron joined along a trigonal, polar c-axis with disorders in the Li positions and has a space group of R3c.69 DFT studies showed that the VB of LiTaO3 is mainly composed of O 2p orbitals, whereas the CB is made up of Ta 5d orbitals.70 It possesses unique piezoelectric, optical and pyroelectric properties.71 Unlike NaTaO3, a strong TaO6 distortion causes the internal Ta–O–Ta angle to reduce to 143°. Zhou et al.72 claimed that LiTaO3 possessed the highest photocatalytic ability amongst ATaO3, where A = Li, Na and K in the order of LiTaO3 > NaTaO3 > KTaO3. The authors used tree-trunk derived alkali tantalates in their study and determined the bandgaps to be 4.8 eV for LiTaO3, 4.0 eV for NaTaO3, and 3.6 eV for KTaO3. The estimated CB edges of LiTaO3, NaTaO3 and KTaO3 are −1.302 V, −1.007 V and −0.98 V respectively. The authors also claimed that the high photocatalytic performance of LiTaO3 is due to its higher reduction potential, which is more favourable for CO2 photoreduction despite its larger bandgap.72 Hence, further modifications to tune the bandgap of LiTaO3 is a promising approach to improve its photocatalytic performance. Moreover, Teramura et al.54 reported a similar claim that the performance for the reduction of CO2 falls in the order of LiTaO3 > NaTaO3 > KTaO3. The author stated that the CB levels and the energy transfer of excited charges significantly contribute to the photocatalytic activities of the alkali tantalates.54
Potassium tantalate, KTaO3, was doped with carbon via a hydrothermal and calcination process.58 The photocatalytic activity was measured in the generation of H2 under simulated sunlight illumination. Carbon-doped KTaO3 presented better performance compared to pure KTaO3 with a H2 generation rate of 592 μmol g−1 h−1 compared to a rate of 228 μmol g−1 h−1. The higher activity is mainly attributed to the higher separation efficiency of electron–hole pairs and the doped carbon concentration is critical to the promotion effect.58 On the other hand, Krukowska et al.57 investigated the effect of doping rare earth (RE) ions into monometallic nanoparticle (MNP) decorated KTaO3 and its H2 generation. MNPs/RE-KTaO3 with a bandgap of 3.37–3.52 eV was produced by incorporating RE ions into the perovskite lattice with photo-deposited MNPs. The formation of H2 was enhanced by the synergistic effect of MNPs and RE ion doped perovskites as shown in Fig. 11a. Sub-bandgap levels were introduced by hydrothermal incorporation of RE ions into the structure while MNPs produce a LSPR effect and activate the surface by adsorption of both O2 and H2O molecules.57

To improve visible-light absorption, Hou et al.68 reported that O2 and N vacancies are capable of regulating the electronic bandgap structure of NaTaON. The concordant contribution of these vacancies shifts the absorption region from the UV to the visible light region. Fig. 11b shows the structural illustration of the perovskite structure. A reduced bandgap of 2.18 eV is obtained by a slight downshift of the CB and an upshift of the VB, attributed to the formation of O2 and N vacancies. The heterojunction also improved charge separation and enhanced stability, hence increasing the photocatalytic CO2 reduction activity with a CO and CH4 yield of 75 and 26 μmol, respectively, after 5 hours under solar light irradiation.68
In addition to tuning of optical bandgaps, Wei and Xu63 demonstrated the positive effects of structural lamination in improving light absorption and suppressing self-oxidative decomposition of SrTaO2N. The produced compound, Sr2TaO3N, is able to undergo water oxidation reactions without the support of a cocatalyst under visible light illumination with the highest O2 evolution of approximately 18 μmol.63Fig. 12 shows the FESEM images obtained for SrTaO2N and Sr2TaO3N, respectively.

Niobates
Similarly, niobium-based perovskite photocatalysts have bandgaps in the range of 3.0–3.5 eV.73–75 It is worth noting that they possess unique properties, such as ferroelectricity, piezoelectricity, non-toxicity and high stability, which makes them a potential candidate as a visible-light driven photocatalyst after modifications.76,77 Energy-band structure engineering, such as modulation of band energy levels, optimization of the crystal structure and morphology control, can significantly enhance their photocatalytic performance under visible light irradiation.
Sodium niobate, NaNbO3, has an orthorhombic crystal structure with a space group of Pbcm at room temperature whereas at temperatures higher than 913 K, the basic perovskite possesses a cubic structure with the space group of Pm3m.53,78 The orthorhombic-structured perovskite has a bandgap of 3.45 eV and an average crystallite size of 23.1 nm. On the other hand, the average crystallite size of the uniform cuboids is calculated to be 18.5 nm with a bandgap of 3.29 eV. The performance of artificial photosynthetic reactions is seen to be higher for the cubic perovskite due to its relatively lower bandgap.78 The VB of NaNbO3 is composed of hybridized O 2p orbitals whereas the CB is mainly composed of Nb 4d orbitals.79 Over the years, researchers have used different synthetic methods to prepare these perovskite photocatalysts. Shi et al.76 studied the effect of the preparation method on the catalytic performance by synthesized NaNbO3via a hydrothermal route and a solid-state reaction method. The hydrothermal method produced straight and smooth nanowires whereas the solid state reaction produced bulk particles with different sizes. With a bandgap of approximately 3.4 eV, the photocatalytic activity of the synthesized samples was measured by the generation of CH4 under UV light irradiation. The homogenous nanowires showed a higher activity with a CH4 evolution of 653 ppm h−1 g−1 as compared to the NaNbO3 particles with a CH4 evolution of 22 ppm h−1 g−1 as it has better crystallinity and a higher surface area.76 Further incorporation of g-C3N4 with NaNbO3 nanowires led to higher CO2 reduction performance compared to bare NaNbO3 or g-C3N4 alone due to the synchronized band structures of NaNbO3 and C3N4, causing them to overlap.79 This is also similar for KNbO3 as shown in Fig. 13b. The FESEM images shown in Fig. 13a demonstrates that KNbO3 consists of cube-shaped particles.80

NaNbO3 and KNbO3 are both indirect bandgap semiconductors with a NbO6 octahedron.81,82 Shi and Zou81 claimed that KNbO3 with a bandgap of 3.1 eV has a higher CO2 photoreduction ability compared to NaNbO3 because the former has a narrower bandgap and a higher number of mobile charge carriers. In hopes of improving the efficiency of the catalyst, researchers experimented by adding dopants into the lattice of NaNbO3. For example, Lais et al.83 incorporated Ag onto NaNbO3 to increase the methanol product selectivity over formic acid from CO2 reduction. Apart from that, Shi et al.84 investigated the effects of a series of anion doping on the electronic structure of NaNbO3 using DFT calculations. The authors concluded that S doping is more suitable for NaNbO3 single anion doping, whereas C and P elements would be more appropriate for co-doping of NaNbO3. The VB of NaNbO3 is mainly composed of O 2p states. For S doping, the S 3p states are able to mix well with the O 2p states and thus widen the VB and reduce the bandgap energy. The findings of this research can serve as a guideline for designing nonmetal-doped multimetal oxides.84
Ferrites
Ferrite perovskites with a general formula of AFeO3, where A = Bi, La, etc., have their native bandgaps in the visible light region. Lanthanum ferrite, LaFeO3, having different sizes and forms, can be fabricated by many distinct techniques, mainly the co-precipitation method,85 hydrothermal process,86–88 solid-state method,89,90 micro-emulsion method91,92 and solution combustion synthesis.93–95 The sol–gel combustion method was used by Humera et al. to synthesize sphere-like LaFeO3 nanoparticles with an average size of 20 nm, whereas grain size nanoparticles of 50 to 161 nm were produced using the micro-emulsion synthesis method.91 The synthesis methods have a strong influence on the crystal structure, crystallite size, and optical as well as photocatalytic properties. LaFeO3 is seen to possess an orthorhombic structure with the space group Pbnm.94 With a bandgap of 2.1 eV, LaFeO3 makes a good photocatalyst under visible light illumination.95 Improvement efforts have been made to further improve the photocatalytic performance of LaFeO3 in water splitting by using reduced graphene oxide (RGO) as a charge sink, electron separator and transporter.95 The H2 production increased by two fold with the use of RGO to alleviate charge recombination. Fig. 14 presents a schematic for the formation process of the nanocomposite. The same method was employed by Humera et al.91 on rare earth substituted nanocrystalline LaFeO3 using the micro-emulsion synthesis route. The study showed that the incorporation of RGO managed to enhance the photocatalytic performance of LaFeO3.91

Most ferroelectric perovskite materials, such as SrTiO3 (ref. 29) and CaTiO3,29,36,37 have bandgaps higher than 3 eV, which enable them to absorb only a small range of the visible spectrum. However, BiFeO3 is a visible-light harvesting photocatalyst, which possesses a direct bandgap in the range of 2.2–2.7 eV.96 Moreover, the distorted rhombohedral perovskite structure of BiFeO3 with a space group of R3c has a large polarization value depending on the crystallographic orientation of its thin films.97 Due to its unique properties, BiFeO3 has been widely studied over the years. Pure or doped ferrites are commonly used in various catalytic processes. For instance, Gd-doped BiFeO3 is an effective metal-doped ferrite catalyst in H2 production for the water splitting process.96 There are many advantages in doping rare earth metals into the lattice of the perovskite. For instance, a larger absorption capability and a longer wavelength of the absorption band edge due to the tuning of bandgap energy levels can be achieved. The H2 production rate increases from 21.9 μmol cm−2 h−1 before Gd doping to 67.6 μmol cm−2 h−1 after Gd doping.96 The authors states that the improvement in performance comes from more efficient electron and hole generation, separation and migration.
Besides doping with metals, some work have been focused on the effect of BiFeO3 as a p-type photocatalyst coupled with an n-type photocatalyst to form a p–n heterojunction for photocatalytic processes.86,87 Karamian and Sharifnia87 conducted a study to investigate the positive effects of a BiFeO3–ZnO p–n heterojunction on CO2 reduction. The composite displayed higher optical responses in the visible light region as well as higher efficiency in charge separation. The highest efficiency of CO2 conversion obtained was 21%, which is mainly attributed to the presence of the p–n junction, which provided an abundance of energetic electrons for the photoconversion of CO2.87 On the other hand, Bagvand et al.86 used ZnS as the n-type photocatalyst instead of ZnO. In both studies, the authors varied the molar ratios of ZnS and ZnO respectively, to investigate the effect of concentration on the performance. Surprisingly, the highest photocatalytic CO2 reduction performance in both studies is obtained at an equimolar ratio of BiFeO3 and ZnO as well as ZnS.86,87 This is mainly attributed to the p–n structure that creates an internal electric field leading to the transfer of charge carriers in the opposite direction which leads to a lower electron–hole recombination rate.86
Summary and prospects
This perspective documents the latest developments in perovskite photocatalysts and the strategies developed for bandgap engineering to improve photocatalytic CO2 reduction activities as well as water splitting performance. A large number of valuable studies have been conducted on various perovskite structures due to their unique properties, such as a tunable bandgap, nanoscale morphology, and high surface area. Different elements occupying the A and B sites will lead to the formation of different perovskite compounds, which will possess different properties and have different impacts on photocatalytic activity. From the widely researched categories of perovskite nanomaterials, it is commonly known that ferrite perovskites have bandgaps in the visible light region. Titanates, tantalates, and niobates have typical bandgaps above 3 eV and hence, these materials are UV-light induced photocatalysts. Table 2 shows the summary of different perovskite photocatalysts and their photocatalytic activities and efficiency under different reaction conditions. However, the perovskite crystal structure is known to be very flexible and it offers an excellent framework for modifications for bandgap tuning to enable visible light absorption. These modifications can be done by various techniques like doping or co-doping with metals or nonmetals, sensitization, facet control and defect engineering, such as inducing vacancies. Apart from that, designing heterostructures such as type-II heterojunctions or Z-scheme composite systems is an efficient strategy to enhance the performance of photocatalysts under visible light irradiation.98–100 Considering that most of the perovskites are wide bandgap semiconductors, the formation of perovskite-based heterostructures is a promising approach in realizing improved photocatalytic performance. This perspective appraises different types of dopants that can widen the photocatalytic range from the UV region to the visible light region. Much work on the potential of perovskite photocatalysts has been carried out, yet there are still some critical issues, such as low stability and low photocatalytic yield. A good photocatalyst has to be potentially scalable, economically feasible, and stable under solar catalyzed conditions and exhibit high photocatalytic performance. Hence, to develop an efficient perovskite photocatalyst, it is crucial to further understand the structure–property relationship and the fundamentals of photocatalysis processes, namely the stages of light absorption, charge separation and migration as well as surface reactions. The perovskite family is a very wide group because there is an incredible flexibility in terms of the ions that can be used for each component of the structure. While these perovskite-based photocatalysts may not be scalable yet for widespread application, continuous development will no doubt bring about improved efficiency for environmental viability in the near future.
