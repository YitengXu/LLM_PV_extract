Weare and Heinz Frei*Physical Biosciences Division, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, University of California, Berkeley, CA 94720, USAReceived 4th August 2009, Accepted 30th September 2009First published on 13th October 2009AbstractAn all-inorganic heterobinuclear chromophore consisting of TiIV oxo-bridged to a MnII center has been assembled on the surface of silica pores of MCM-41 material. The key step of covalent attachment on the pore surface is the reaction of a MnII precursor featuring weakly held CH3CN ligands with the OH group of a previously anchored titanol site. The optical diffuse reflectance spectrum reveals a TiIVOMnII→ TiIIIOMnIII metal-to-metal charge-transfer (MMCT) absorption extending from the UV throughout to visible into the red spectral region. FT-IR, FT-Raman and optical spectroscopy confirm that the material is free of Mn oxide clusters, while EPR and Mn K-edge X-ray absorption spectra indicate that the donor center is predominantly in oxidation state +2. In situ FT-IR spectroscopy allowed detection of visible light-induced redox chemistry of the MMCT unit using O2 (18O2) and methanol as acceptor and donor probe molecules, respectively. Formate and water were observed as primary products, with methyl formate emerging as a secondary condensation product. The observed photochemistry demonstrates that excitation of the TiIVOMnII→ TiIIIOMnIII results in complete transfer of an electron from donor to acceptor center, with the charge separation sufficiently long lived for initiation of redox chemistry to occur. With donor and acceptor redox potentials appropriate for driving multi-electron catalysts for water oxidation, proton or CO2 reduction, the TiOMnII unit is an attractive candidate as a charge-transfer chromophore in a solar fuel generating system.1. IntroductionRobust charge-transfer chromophores for driving multi-electron transfer catalysts for water oxidation, carbon dioxide reduction or hydrogen evolution with visible light are critical for developing viable artificial photosynthetic systems. All-inorganic heterobinuclear groups linked by an oxo bridge that are covalently anchored on a nanoporous silica support absorb deep in the visible region by virtue of low-energy metal-to-metal charge-transfer absorptions transitions.1–3 We have recently demonstrated that units of this type can serve as visible light electron pump for driving a multi-electron transfer catalyst. For example, a TiOCrIII chromophore coupled to an Ir oxide nanocluster in the channels of mesoporous silica MCM-41 was shown to evolve O2 from water under visible light with a quantum efficiency of 13%.4,5 In some cases, the heterobinuclear unit itself can act as light absorber and redox site, for example in the case of ZrOCuI, which splits CO2 to CO.6 Arranging and coupling photocatalytic units for CO2 reduction and H2O oxidation in nanoporous silica scaffolds offers opportunities for developing robust integrated artificial photosynthetic systems for the conversion of carbon dioxide and water to a fuel.Following initial demonstration of binuclear metal-to-metal charge-transfer (MMCT) units with d10 or s2 donors like CuI or SnII linked to Ti or Zr in mesoporous MCM-41,1,6 binuclear units featuring donor and acceptor centers made of transition metals rather than main group metals were synthesized in our laboratory2–4 and by the Hashimoto group.7,8 Specifically, charge-transfer chromophores with CoII, CrIII, CeIII, and FeII donor centers were demonstrated. With their wide range of oxidation states and redox potentials, transition metals are particularly useful as donor or acceptor centers because of the ability to precisely match the potential of the chromophore with that of a multi-electron transfer catalyst. Matching of redox potentials of chromophore and catalyst is a prerequisite for achieving thermodynamic efficiency of a photocatalytic process. For example, transient CoIII, CrIV, CeIV, MnIII generated upon excitation of corresponding MMCT units possess redox potentials suitable for driving a water oxidation catalyst with modest overpotential.Manganese is particularly attractive as a donor because many of its oxidation states possess redox potentials9 that are suitable for driving demanding photocatalytic reactions. In this paper, we report the synthesis and spectroscopic characterization of a new robust heterobinuclear charge-transfer chromophore featuring a MnII center linked to TiIV on the surface of mesoporous silica MCM-41. The unit absorbs across a broad range of the visible spectrum. Excited state metal-to-metal charge-transfer reactivity was demonstrated using O2 and methanol as acceptor and donor probe molecule, respectively.2. ExperimentalSynthesisMCM-41 was prepared using a previously reported method.10 Cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB, 2.2 g) was dissolved in 52 mL distilled water at 40 °C followed by addition of 26 mL ammonium hydroxide, and the solution was stirred at room temperature for 1 h. Tetraethoxysilane (TEOS, 10 mL) was slowly added to the solution while continuously stirring for another 3 h at RT. The resulting mixture was transferred into a Teflon-lined autoclave and heated at 110 °C for 72 h. The product was collected by filtration and extensively washed with distilled water. Template-free MCM-41 was obtained by calcination in air at 550 °C for 8 h.Mn-MCM-41 was prepared by grafting Mn(NCCH3)2Cl2 onto calcined MCM-41. The synthesis was conducted combining Schlenk techniques and nitrogen-filled glove box. The precursor Mn(NCCH3)2Cl2 was synthesized using the method reported by Hathaway.11 Because of its low solubility in acetonitrile, MnCl2 was extracted in a Soxhlet apparatus. The pink powder of Mn(NCCH3)2Cl2 was filtered off, washed with acetonitrile and dried under reduced pressure. To graft Mn onto MCM-41 (2 mol% loading), the precursor Mn(NCCH3)2Cl2 (35 mg) was dissolved in 50 mL distilled CH3CN. Then, 0.5 g dehydrated MCM-41 was added into the solution followed by 1 h stirring. Triethylamine (TEA, 1 mL) was added dropwise into the solution to activate the surface silanol groups. Within 3 h, the solution turned from white to pink, indicating successful grafting of Mn onto MCM-41. The powder was collected by filtration and washed with CH3CN.Ti-grafted MCM-41 was produced according to the method reported by Maschmeyer et al.12 The synthesis was performed as follows: 1.8 g calcined MCM-41 was dehydrated at 150 °C overnight, which was then added to the solution of 153 mg titanocene dichloride in dichloromethane. The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 1 h, followed by dropwise addition of TEA. The color of the solution changed from red to yellow within 6 h. A pale yellow product was obtained after washing with dichloromethane. Removal of the template was accomplished by calcination in air at 550 °C for 5 h. The binuclear metallic material TiMn-MCM-41 was produced using a similar procedure as Mn-MCM-41, except that Ti-grafted MCM-41 was used instead of MCM-41. To remove the organic ligands, as-synthesized, pink TiMn-MCM-41 powder was heated at 350 °C for 5 h under vacuum. ICP-MS of this material demonstrates that TiMn-MCM-41 at the loading levels described (1 mol% Ti, 2 mol% Mn) results in a Ti : Mn molar ratio of 1 : 1.58. The quantity of Mn is identical in Mn MCM-41 and TiMn MCM-41.Physical measurementsUV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) were recorded with a Shimadzu UV-2100 spectrometer equipped with integrating sphere model ISR-260. Barium sulfate was used as a reference. The materials were pressed into pellets and mounted in a home-built stainless steel vacuum cell. FT-IR spectra were recorded using Bruker model IFS88 or IFS66V equipped with liquid-nitrogen-cooled MCT detectors. Pressed self-sustained pellets of powder (6∼8 mg) were mounted in a transmission infrared vacuum cell equipped with KBr windows.The samples for photochemical experiments were dehydrated at 150 °C overnight. Methanol and O2 was loaded into the pellet from the gas phase through a vacuum manifold, and infrared spectra were recorded at 1 cm−1 resolution. Photolysis was conducted with 476 nm emission of an argon ion laser (Coherent model Innova 90-6) or 355 nm emission of a pulsed Nd: YAG laser (Quanta Ray model DRC2A).The powder XRD analysis was performed on a Siemens model D500 diffractometer equipped with CuKα radiation source (λ = 1.5406 Å). An accelerating voltage of 40 kV and a current of 30 mA were used. The materials were recorded with 2θ value ranging from 0.5–10° with a step size of 0.02° and a scanning rate of 1° min−1. The XRD patterns of Mn-MCM-41 and TiMn-MCM-41 samples were also recorded over the range of 20–80° with a step size of 0.2° and a scanning rate of 5° min−1 to determine the presence of manganese oxide clusters.X-Band EPR spectra were performed with a Varian E-109 spectrometer, standard TE102 cavity, and an Air Products liquid helium cryostat. Spectra were collected at 20 K, using 1 mW microwave power and 32 G modulation amplitude. Powder samples of approximately 10 mg were introduced into the chamber using sealed quartz EPR tubes, and the spectra normalized for the specific amount of material added.X-Ray absorption spectra (XAS) were collected at Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory (SSRL) on beamline 7-3 at electron energy 3.0 GeV and an average current of 300–500 mA. The beamline is equipped with a Si(220) double crystal monochromator. To reduce the sample damage by radiation, the incident X-ray beam was defocused at the sample position. The intensity of the incident X-ray beam was monitored by a N2-filled ion chamber (I0) in front of the sample. The samples were kept at 9 ± 1 K in a He atmosphere at ambient pressure using an Oxford CF-1208 continuous-flow liquid He cryostat. Data were recorded as fluorescence excitation spectra using a germanium 30-element energy-resolving detector (Canberra Electronics). For Mn K-edge XAS, energy was calibrated by the pre-edge peak of KMnO4 (6543.3 eV), which was placed between two N2 filled ionization chambers (I1 and I2) after the sample.ChemicalsCetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB), ammonium hydroxide (30%), tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS), titanocene dichloride (TiCp2Cl2) and manganese dichloride (anhydrous) were obtained from Aldrich and used as received. Acetonitrile was distilled over CaH2; dichloromethane was dried over 3 Å molecular sieve activated at 250 °C; triethylamine (TEA) was dried over sodium. Methanol was degassed by 3 cycles of freeze-pump-thaw process. Oxygen gas (Air Products, 99.997%) and 18O2 gas (Cambridge Isotopes, 97.5%) were used as received.3. Results and discussion3.1 Structural characterizationMnII(NCCH3)2Cl2 with labile acetonitrile ligands was used as precursor for grafting of Mn centers. The DRS of Mn(NCCH3)2Cl2 mechanically mixed with MCM-41 (wt 2%, shown in Fig. S1, ESI13)† has absorption bands at 256, 305, 348, 435 and 517 nm characteristic of d–d transitions of distorted octahedral MnII species.14 As seen in ESI Fig. S2,†13 the infrared spectrum of Mn(NCCH3)2Cl2 shows ligand CN stretching band at 2312 and 2285 cm−1, distinct from CN stretching modes of free CH3CN (2292 and 2253 cm−1) or CH3CN physisorbed on MCM-41 (2298 and 2265 cm−1).1Triethylamine in as-synthesized Mn-MCM-41 can be removed by calcination in air or by heating under vacuum at 350 °C. However, after calcination in air the color of as-synthesized material changed from pink to brown, and DRS confirmed that MnII was oxidized to higher oxidation states. Therefore, in this study, organic free materials were obtained by heating the samples under vacuum at 350 °C. As shown in ESI Fig. S3,†13 powder XRD patterns of Mn-MCM-41 exhibit typical diffraction peaks assigned to (100), (110) and (200) reflections, indicating that the hexagonal mesoporous structure of MCM-41 was maintained after grafting. The d100 spacing is increased from 40.9 Å of parent calcined MCM-41 to 41.2 Å of organic-free MnII-MCM-41. The absence of distinct reflections in the wide angle region is consistent with the absence of manganese oxide species.Fig. 1a shows the optical DRS of as-synthesized Mn-MCM-41(2%). Two absorptions are observed, a shoulder at 260 nm and a broad band centered at 465 nm extending beyond 600 nm. The 260 nm absorption is assigned to two overlapping bands, namely the OMnII ligand-to-metal charge-transfer transition (LMCT) and the 6A1g→4T1g ligand field transition of distorted octahedral MnII, while the 465 nm band originates from the 6A1g→4T2g transition.14,15 Note that substantial amounts of MnIII would give rise to an intense OMnIII LMCT band centered at 320 nm,15 but only a weak shoulder is observed at that spectral position. At wavelengths shorter than 400 nm, the spectrum also contains contribution from TEA present in the as-synthesized sample (shown in the inset of Fig. 1).

To explore the influence of precursors on the coordination environment of the isolated Mn center, Mn-grafting was also performed with a tetrahedral precursor (Et4N)2MnCl4.16 The color of (Et4N)2MnCl4 is light green, characteristic of tetrahedral divalent Mn. Interestingly, we again obtained a pink product after grafting which shows an essentially identical optical spectrum as Mn-MCM-41 prepared by using Mn(NCCH3)2Cl2 precursor (see ESI Fig. S4†13). This clearly demonstrates that isolated Mn centers anchored on MCM-41 prefer distorted octahedral geometry irrespective of precursor used.The synthesis of bimetallic TiMn-MCM-41 material was performed following exactly the same procedure as for Mn-MCM-41. Grafting of Mn onto Ti-MCM-41 was faster than MCM-41 because of the higher acidity of TiOH compared to SiOH as described previously.2The diffuse reflectance spectrum of as-synthesized TiMn-MCM-41 presented in Fig. 1b exhibits similar features as Mn-MCM-41, except that there is additional absorption extending from the UV region to 700 nm. Since Ti-MCM-41 has no absorption at wavelength longer than 330 nm, the difference of the TiMn and Mn-MCM-41 spectra (Fig. 1a and b) is attributed to the TiIV–O–MnII→ TiIII–O–MnIII metal-to-metal charge-transfer transition (MMCT). Corresponding optical spectra of TiMn and Mn-MCM-41 material following removal of TEA by heating in vacuum are shown in Fig. 2, with the difference between the TiMn and Mn curves showing the broad MMCT band extending across the entire visible spectrum into the near infrared region (more precisely, the MMCT band corresponds to the difference between the TiMn-MCM-41 spectrum and the sum of the monometallic Mn and Ti samples, as shown in Fig. 2). The vacuum treated material is utilized in the photochemical experiments described below. The closest precedent of this type of charge-transfer transition for the case of TiMn is the visible light absorbing MnII–TiIV MMCT band of MgTi2O5 doped with MnII, reported by Blasse.17 MMCT transitions originate from an overlap of d orbitals of donor and acceptor centers separated by an O bridge, and extinction coefficients are around 103 L mol−1 cm−1.18 Fig. 2  UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectrum of (a) Mn-MCM-41(2%) heated under vacuum at 350 C. (b) TiMn-MCM-41(2%) heated under vacuum at 350 C. (c) Sum of Ti-MCM-41 and Mn-MCM-41 spectra. FT-IR spectra of as-synthesized Mn-MCM-41 and TiMn-MCM-41 featured C–H stretching absorptions at 2990, 2950, and 2891 cm−1, C–N stretching bands at 1480, 1460, and 1395 cm−1, and a C–N bending band at 732 cm−1, which are characteristic of TEA (ESI Fig. S5).† No CN stretching bands of the CH3CN ligands of the precursor (2312 and 2285 cm−1) were detected, indicating that the organic ligands of the precursor are spontaneously replaced upon interaction with the silica nanopore surface at room temperature. Furthermore, FT-Raman and FT-IR spectra of the low frequency region 1000–500 cm−1 do not show any of the characteristic bands of oxide clusters of type MnO, Mn3O4, or Mn2O3;19 authentic spectra of these clusters mixed with MCM-41 are shown in ESI Fig. S6.†13 Moreover, absence of a distinct band at 611 nm in the optical spectrum of Mn or TiMn-MCM-41 materials (ESI, Fig. S6(C))† confirms that no MnO clusters are formed.20 We conclude from these optical and infrared spectroscopic studies that the Mn-MCM-41 and TiMn-MCM-41 materials obtained here do not show evidence for the formation of metal oxide clusters, and that the majority of the Mn centers are in oxidation state II.X-Band EPR spectra of both Mn MCM-41 and TiMn MCM-41 (Fig. 3) show the presence of a six-line signal, which is a signature of octahedral MnII.21 The nearly identical peak shape and spacing between peaks show that the environment surrounding each MnII center is similar, which is expected since Mn is in a similar electromagnetic environment in two materials. Fig. 3  X-Band EPR spectra of (a) Mn-MCM-41(2%) and (b) TiMn-MCM-41(1% Ti, 2% Mn). The six-line signal indicates that Mn+2 is the primary EPR active species. Spectra were recorded at 20 K. Grafting of MnII(NCCH3)2Cl2 onto either MCM-41 or Ti MCM-41 results in samples with similar net oxidation states of Mn, according to the Mn K-edge structure of X-ray absorption spectra shown in Fig. 4. This result indicates that the Mn sites are similar in the two materials, and precludes major structural or oxidative differences between the two systems. By contrast, when purposefully oxidizing MnII by calcination of TiMn-MCM-41 (Fig. 4), we observed a substantial shift in the Mn K-edge to higher energy, consistent with oxidation of the individual Mn sites.21 Fig. 4  Mn K-edge X-ray absorption spectra of Mn-SBA-15 (black), TiMn-SBA-15 (red), and calcined TiMn-SBA-15 (green). 3.2 Probing TiOMn excited state reactivity3.2.1 In situ FT-IR spectroscopy of MMCT-induced redox chemistry. Loading of gaseous methanol (3 Torr) into an infrared vacuum cell holding a TiMn-MCM-41 wafer (DRS spectra shown in Fig 2b) resulted in absorption bands at 3503, 3238, 2995 (sh), 2953, 2845, 1472, 1451,1389 and 1350 cm−1 (sh). The most informative spectral region 2000–1300 cm−1 is shown in Fig. 5A. The bands agree well with the spectrum of CH3OH physisorbed onto other types of nanoporous materials such as Ti silicalite22 or Fe aluminophosphate sieve.23 Absorptions at 3503 and 3238 cm−1 are assigned to the OH stretch mode of methanol with free hydroxyl group and strongly H bonded to the pore surface, respectively. Subsequent addition of 260 Torr O2 resulted in a slight intensity increase of the CH3OH spectrum as additional methanol was pushed into the silica pores when adding oxygen gas. The only other spectral change noted upon loading and when leaving the sample in the dark for prolonged periods of time was a slow increase of the two small bands at 1635 and 1468 cm−1. Growth of these peaks was also observed when loading CH3OH onto monometallic Ti-MCM-41 (ESI Fig. S7).†13 By analogy with observations reported upon exposure of methanol to TiO2 particle surfaces,24 the growth of H2O at 1635 cm−1 and methoxy groups at 1468 cm−125,26 is attributed to a small amount of CH3OH condensation with surface TiOH groups to form CH3OTi + H2O. While much less abundant than silanol groups on the silica nanopore surface, TiOH hydroxyls are known to be more acidic, hence more reactive than SiOH groups.1,2 Fig. 5  (A) FT-IR spectrum of TiMn-MCM-41 loaded with 3 Torr CH3OH. (B) FT-IR difference spectra upon irradiation at 476 nm (480 mW cm−2) of TiMn-MCM-41 loaded with 3 Torr CH3OH and 260 Torr O2 at 1 h, 2 h, and 5 h. (C) Spectral deconvolution of H2O (1630 cm−1) and HCO2− (1598 cm−1) bands. Inset shows plot of integrated band intensity as function of time. (D) Demonstration of the quality of the deconvolution (3 h point). Product growth upon irradiation of the loaded TiMn-MCM-41 material with 476 nm light (480 mW cm−2), readily discerned by infrared spectroscopy, was at 1598, 1630 (shoulder), 1719, 1741, 1756, and 1766 cm−1. The last three mentioned bands agree with the P,Q and R branches of ν(CO) of gas phase methyl formate (HC(O)OCH3).27 The 1719 cm−1 peak originates from methyl formate adsorbed in the silica pores, while the 1598 cm−1 absorption is due to formate (HCO2−). The latter is characteristic of HCO2− (νas(CO2)) interacting with a metal center on silica nanopore surfaces including Mn.22,28,29 The 1630 cm−1 shoulder originates from H2O. Methyl formate assignments are based on the measurement of the spectrum of an authentic sample in TiMn-MCM-41, and on previous photochemical studies of methanol oxidation in TS-1 and FeAlPO-5 transition metal molecular sieves.22,30,31 The concurrent decrease of the methanol bands reflects photochemical consumption of the reactant along with a minor contribution from desorption due to a slight heating effect of the photolysis light (1–2°). As shown in Fig. 5B, and more clearly in the deconvoluted (and base line corrected) spectra and inset of Fig. 5C, the absorbance growth of HCO2− at 1598 cm−1 and H2O at 1630 cm−1 is prompt while the growth of the 1719 cm−1 band of adsorbed HC(O)OCH3 exhibits an induction period indicating that it is a secondary reaction product. The gradual buildup of methyl formate in the gas phase reflects facile desorption of the ester molecules from the large silica channels.When conducting the 476 nm photolysis with 18O2, the CO stretch of methyl formate was accompanied by a new band ad 1688 cm−1 of equal intensity, while the asymmetric stretch of formate at 1598 cm−1 was replaced by a peak at 1592 cm−1, as shown in Fig. 6. The 6 cm−1 18O isotope shift is characteristic for partially labelled formate HC18O16O−,31 while the 29 cm−1 18O shift of methyl formate is typical for a CO stretch.29 With the reaction of CH3OH + 18O2 forming partially 18O labelled formate and an equimolar mixture of HC(18O)OCH3 and HC(16O)OCH3, we conclude that O2 and CH3OH each contribute one O to the product. Fig. 6  FT-IR difference spectra upon 476 nm irradiation of CH3OH + O2 reaction in TiMn-MCM-41 for 6 h at room temperature. (a) CH3OH + 16O2. (b) CH3OH + 18O2. The growth of the two sequential products, formate + H2O and methyl formate, was confirmed by photolysis with shorter wavelength light at 355 nm, as shown in Fig. 7. Because of the higher product yield, additional peaks of HC(O)OCH3 are detected at 1441 and 1381 cm−1 according to authentic methyl formate spectra, while the band emerging at 1359 cm−1 is assigned to the symmetric stretch of HCO2− interacting with a Mn center.32,33 The distinct kinetics of the formate (1598 cm−1) and methyl formate product (1717 cm−1) are clearly evident from a comparison of the intensity of the two bands in the first 2 h of photolysis and after 8 h. Fig. 7  FT-IR difference spectra upon irradiation at 355 nm of CH3OH (3 Torr) and O2 (260 Torr) loaded into TiMn-MCM-41. Spectra after 1 h, 2 h, 4 h, and 8 h are shown. Irradiation with 476 nm light (480 mW cm−2) of the corresponding monometallic material Ti-MCM-41 loaded with methanol and O2 gave no photoproducts, as expected, but photolysis was noted in the experiment with Mn-MCM-41. As shown in Fig. 8B (raw difference spectra) and 8C (deconvoluted bands of the 1740–1550 cm−1 region), growth occurs at 1719 (very weak, HC(O)OCH3)), 1630 (H2O), 1598 cm−1 (HCO2−), and 1467 cm−1 (OCH3). Again, growth of formate and H2O is prompt while methyl formate shows an induction period, although the yield is very low. Two striking differences are noted when comparing photolysis in Mn-MCM-41 with the experiment in TiMn-MCM-41. The H2O band at 1630 cm−1 increases much more strongly in monometallic Mn-MCM-41 than in TiMn-MCM-41. This is attributed to condensation of CH3OH with acidic surface OH, presumably MnOH sites as indicated by substantial growth of the methoxy (CH3O) band at 1467 cm−1. The growth at 1467 cm−1 is evident from a comparison of the spectrum of adsorbed CH3OH (Fig. 8A) and the difference spectrum shown in Fig. 8B. Second, methyl formate growth after 1 h photolysis is a factor of 5 lower and the HCO2− growth is 2.1 times smaller for the Mn-MCM-41 compared to photolysis in TiMn-MCM-41. The fact that any methanol oxidation occurs at all in Mn-MCM-41 and even accelerates with time is due to thermal oxidation of MnII to MnIII in the presence of gaseous O2, as indicated by an increase of the MnIII–OII→ MnII–OI ligand-to-metal charge-transfer (LMCT) absorption in the near UV region of the DRS. We conclude that methanol oxidation yields in monometallic Mn-MCM-41 are much smaller (∼5 times) than in the presence of TiOMnII charge-transfer chromophores and are caused by residual MnIII LMCT absorption. As will be seen from the mechanism discussed below, LMCT-induced methanol oxidation is expected to lead to the same photoproducts as MMCT-driven photolysis.

(B) FT-IR difference spectra upon irradiation at 476 nm (480 mW cm−2) of Mn-MCM-41 loaded with 3 Torr CH3OH and 260 Torr O2 at 1 h, 2 h, and 5 h.

(D) Demonstration of quality of spectral deconvolution (3 h point). 3.2.2 Proposed mechanism. Excitation of the TiIVOMnII→ TiIIIOMnIII charge transfer state induces oxidation of methanol by O2 most likely by direct electron transfer from CH3OH to transient MnIII and from TiIII to O2, as shown in Scheme 1. The superoxide radical anion and methanol cation, which is highly acidic, are expected to undergo rapid proton transfer to form HOO and CH2OH radicals followed by recombination to yield hydroxylmethyl hydroperoxide. In fact, in a previous time-resolved FT-IR study of charge-transfer induced reaction of CH3OH and O2 at an excited Fe center (FeIII–OII→ FeII–OI LMCT) in a microporous solid, we have been able to directly observed transient HOOCH2OH.29,31 The intermediate dissociated to HCO2− and H2O within 4 s at room temperature, followed by slow reaction with excess methanol to form methyl formate. This mechanism readily explains the prompt growth of HCO2− and H2O, and the induction period for methyl formate growth in the MMCT-induced reaction reported here (Fig. 5). Furthermore, this mechanism is in agreement with our observation in the 18O labelling experiment that one oxygen atom from methanol and one from O2 is incorporated into the formate and methyl formate products. Additionally, excitation of TiOMnII chromophore was found to deplete the MMCT band and result in growth of MnIII LMCT absorption when irradiating TiMn-MCM-41 loaded with O2 gas only, as shown in Fig. 9. In this experiment, transient TiIII generated by MMCT excitation is re-oxidized to TiIV by electron transfer to O2 while the donor remains in the oxidized MnIII state. Hence, the MMCT band is depleted during photolysis while the MnIIIOII charge-transfer absorption grows in. Fig. 9  UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectrum of TiMn-MCM-41 (a) before 476 nm (480 mW cm−2) photolysis in the presence of 260 Torr O2, (b) after photolysis.  Scheme 1 We conclude that excitation of the MMCT state of TiOMnII results in a TiIIIOMnIII state sufficiently long lived to transfer an electron to O2 and pull an electron from methanol. Since the standard reduction potential for one-electron reduction of O2 is known to vary very little with polarity or pH of the medium,34 the MMCT-induced electron transfer implies that the redox potential of transient TiIII is equal or more negative than −0.3 V (NHE). With a redox potential of +1.5 V for transient MnIII,9 one electron oxidation of CH3OH is expected to be facile since CH3OH can be oxidized at ∼0.9 V (NHE) under neutral conditions.354. ConclusionsIn summary, an all-inorganic TiOMnII metal-to-metal charge-transfer chromophore anchored on silica pore surfaces has been assembled. The unit absorbs from the UV across the visible into the red spectral region. Illumination in the presence of O2 acceptor and methanol donor molecules results in MMCT-induced redox chemistry with formate and water as primary products. Methyl formate emerged as secondary condensation product of formate and excess methanol. The result demonstrates that excitation of the TiIVOMnII→ TiIIIOMnIII leads to complete transfer of an electron from the donor to the acceptor center, with the lifetime of the charge separation sufficiently long for initiation of redox chemistry to take place.The TiOMnII unit is a particularly attractive candidate as charge-transfer chromophore for driving multi-electron catalysts for solar fuel generation. From the standpoint of redox energetics, the transient MnIII donor center has a potential appropriate for driving a metal oxide nanocluster catalyst for water oxidation such as Co3O4 in a nanoporous scaffold at modest overpotential.36 Chromophores with redox potentials that are matched with those of the catalyst are essential for achieving high thermodynamic efficiency upon photon to chemical energy conversion. The observation that O2 acts as acceptor of the excited MMCT state implies that the transient TiIII center has a reducing potential of at least −0.3 V, which is suitable in principle for activating multi-electron catalysts for hydrogen evolution or carbon dioxide reduction. Attempts to couple the chromophore unit to catalysts relevant for fuel generation are in progress in our laboratory.
