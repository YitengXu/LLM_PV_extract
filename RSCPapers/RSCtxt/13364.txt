    , Accepted 19th August 2021First published on 20th August 2021AbstractMetallothermically reducing silica to nano-silicon is an energy-effective and straightforward way using low-cost raw materials. Herein, we report a scalable technique to produce nano-Si particles from SiO2 with the assistance of AlCl3, using zinc (Zn) as the reductant, and Zn can be recovered by electrochemical deposition in an aqueous solution. Thermodynamically, the reactivity of metal reductants should be higher than that of Si. However, opposing the thermodynamic rule, SiO2 can be reduced to Si by Zn that is less reactive than Si. The underlying mechanism of the abnormal spontaneous zincothermic reduction reaction stems from the existence of AlCl3 acting as a chlorination agent that first transforms SiO2 into SiCl4, which is subsequently reduced by Zn. Thus, the reaction of AlCl3-assisted metallothermic reduction of SiO2 is herein revealed for the first time, which is termed the chlorination–reduction reaction that obeys the thermodynamic rule. The revealed chlorination–reduction mechanism can explain the reason why the AlCl3 additive can enable the metallothermic reduction of SiO2 at such a low temperature of 250 °C. Moreover, the obtained nano-Si delivers a specific discharge capacity of 1450 mA h g−1 at 2 A g−1 after 400 cycles. Overall, this paper expands the choice of reductants and provides new insights into understanding the AlCl3-assisted metallothermic reduction of SiO2.
1. Introduction
The great achievement of the information era and the widespread utilization of solar energy are in debt to the large-scale production of Si and its purification process.1–4 Currently, metallurgical Si is industrially produced by carbothermic reduction at a temperature over 1800 °C.5–7 Generally speaking, SiO2 is reduced to Si by carbon while generating CO2/CO. However, the reduction process involves many processes:8 (1) the reaction of liquid Si with liquid SiO2 (reaction (1)) to produce SiO gas, (2) the gaseous SiO reacts with SiC to generate liquid Si and CO (reaction (2)), and (3) gaseous SiO reacts with C to generate SiC and CO (reaction (3)). SiO2(l) + Si(l) = SiO(g) T > 2000 °C(1) SiO(g) + SiC(s) = Si(l) + CO(g) T > 1820 °C(2) SiO(g) + C(s) = SiC(s) + CO(g) T > 1500 °C(3)
Thus, there are five components and three phases that exist in the reduction process, and the reactions include liquid-to-liquid, gas-to-solid, liquid-to-gas, and gas-to-liquid conversions. From the perspective of materials synthesis, the processes and phases of components in the whole production process have a significant effect on productivity and efficiency.9 Although the carbothermic reduction technology is mature, detailed information on the production of metallurgical Si has been nearly ignored in the field of materials science. Thus, learning from the classic metallurgical process is absolutely beneficial to inspire and guide nowadays materials synthesis. Besides carbothermic reduction, the metallothermic reaction of SiO2 has received intense attention because of the urgent need for preparing nanostructured Si anodes for high-performance lithium-ion batteries (LIBs).10–13 Hence, developing more efficient reduction processes to produce nano-Si with defined properties has been long sought after.
Unlike carbothermic reduction, metallothermic reduction is usually performed at a temperature lower than 1000 °C and the product is Si powder rather than liquid Si.14,15 Below 660 °C the rate of the aluminothermic reduction of SiO2 is low because it is a solid–solid reaction and there is a dense layer of Al2O3 on the Al surface.16,17 Besides Al, the magnesiothermic reduction of SiO2 is widely performed at a temperature between 650 and 800 °C to achieve an acceptable reduction rate and maintain the nanostructures of Si powder.18–20 Thermodynamically, Mg can reduce SiO2 to Si even at room temperature, but the reduction rate is low because of the sluggish kinetics and a protective MgO layer existing at the solid SiO2/Mg interface.21 Increasing the temperature above 650 °C can turn the solid Mg into liquid and gaseous Mg, thus inducing both solid–liquid and solid–gas reactions that have a relatively high reduction rate.22 More recently, molten AlCl3-assisted Mg- and Al-metallothermic processes can significantly decrease the reaction temperature to below 300 °C.23–26 It has been claimed that molten AlCl3 can dissolve Al2O3 on the surface of the Al reductant, thereby refreshing the Al/SiO2 interface and enhancing the reduction rate.24,27 However, we are still wondering whether the solid–solid reaction can sustain such a high reduction rate. After digging into the basic thermodynamic data of AlCl3 and Al2O3, we found that the Gibbs formation energy of Al2O3 (−791.1 kJ, 25 °C) is more negative than that of AlCl3 (−630 kJ, 25 °C), which is different from other metal oxides and chlorides because the Gibbs formation energies of most metal oxides are more positive than that of their chlorides. This means that Al2O3 is thermodynamically more stable than AlCl3. Therefore, Al2O3 is a thermodynamically stable compound in a system containing Al3+, Cl−, and O2−. In other words, Al3+ has the capability to steal O2− from other oxides that have a weaker M–O bond than that of Al2O3. According to thermodynamic calculations, we discovered that AlCl3 can spontaneously react with SiO2 to generate gaseous SiCl4 and Al2O3 below 600 °C (eqn (4)). AlCl3 + SiO2 = SiCl4(g) + Al2O3(4)
In this case, the AlCl3-assisted metallothermic reduction of SiO2 should involve two steps: the chlorination of SiO2 and the subsequent reduction of SiCl4 gas. Thus, the low-temperature reduction process involve both liquid–solid and solid–gas reactions that have a much higher reaction rate than the solid–solid reaction. Therefore, we aim to reveal and prove the mechanism of the AlCl3-assisted metallothermic reduction process.
In this paper, we employed Zn to reduce SiO2 with the assistance of molten AlCl3. As expected from our assumption, we successfully prepared Si powder using Zn as the reductant that is less thermodynamically stable than Si. This surprising finding supports our proposed chlorination–reduction mechanism because Zn can reduce SiCl4 to Si spontaneously. We then evaluated the Li-storage performance using the zincothermic reduction of Si in half-cells and full-cells.
2. Experimental
2.1 Zincothermic reduction of SiO2
In a typical procedure, 8.0 g of AlCl3 (AR 99%, Aladdin) and 3 g of micro-Zn powder (Sinopharm Chemical Reagent, 10–20 μm, AR 99%) were mixed and loaded into a polyphenylene (PPL) inner tank (volume: 45 mL). Subsequently, 1 g of nano-SiO2 (50–100 nm, AR 99%, Aladdin) was added into the PPL tank and mixed with an AlCl3 and Zn mixture uniformly. The above procedures were conducted in a glove-box filled with ultrapure Ar (99.999%). The PPL inner tank was sealed in an autoclave and then heated in a blast drying oven with a heating rate of 5 °C min−1 and maintained at 250 °C for 12 h. After the reaction, the sample was cooled down to room temperature naturally, collected, and washed with 1 M HCl, distilled water, and ethanol. Finally, the obtained product was dried in a vacuum oven at 50 °C for 12 h. The zincothermic reduction of SiCl4 was also performed.
2.2 Recovery of zinc
After the sample was leached with 1 M HCl and water, we collected the leachate. The solvents in the leachate included AlOCl, AlCl3, and ZnCl2. We used a quartz beaker to act as an electrolysis tank, a graphite rod as an anode, Al foil as a cathode, and the leachate as an aqueous solution. Subsequently, we applied 4 V direct current for 0.9 h for the electrodeposition of Zn. After electrolysis, the Zn plate was stripped from the cathode and then dried in a vacuum oven at 50 °C for 12 h. The cathode and anode surface area is about 12 cm−2.
2.3 Li-storage performance
First, the as-prepared powder was made into a slurry containing Si powder, super P, and sodium alginate (SA) binder at a mass ratio of 6:2:2, and water. Second, the slurry was cast onto copper foil that was then vacuum dried at 100 °C for 10 h. Third, the copper foil loaded with the active materials was cut into discs (diameter: 1.2 cm), and the mass loading of each disc electrode was ∼0.8 mg cm−2. Fourth, coin-type half-cells (CR 2025) were assembled, which contained lithium foil as the counter electrode and the as-prepared disc working electrode, which were separated by a polymer separator (Celgard 2400). The electrolyte was 1 M LiPF6 dissolved in an ethylene carbonate (EC)/diethylene carbonate (DEC)/fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) (0.45:0.45:0.1 volume ratio) solvent. Galvanostatic charge/discharge tests (GCD, voltage range: 0.01–1.0 V), cyclic voltammetry (0.01–1.5 V, scan rate: 0.1 mV s−1), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS, frequency range: 10−2 to 105 Hz, voltage amplitude: 5 mV) were performed on an electrochemical workstation (CHI 760E, Shanghai Chenhua Instrument Co., Ltd.) and a battery test system (LAND CT2001A, Wuhan Jinnuo Electronic Co., Ltd.).
A full cell was assembled to further evaluate the Li-storage performance of the zincothermic-derived Si powder. The cathode slurry was prepared by mixing 90 wt% LiCoO2, 5 wt% Super P, and 5 wt% polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) binder dissolved in moderate N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP). The cathode slurry was coated on aluminum foil, which was then vacuum dried and cut into disc cathodes. The mass loading of each cathode was ∼7.2 mg cm−2. The anode was a prelithiated-Si anode that was the same as in the half-type cell. The pre-lithiation of the Si anode was performed in a half-cell configuration for three cycles at 500 mA h g−1 between 0.01 and 1.0 V. The capacity ratio of prelithiated anode/cathode (N/P ratio) was approximately 1.0. The full cells were tested between 3.0 and 4.2 V, and the specific capacity was calculated based on the cathode weight.
2.4 Characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD, Shimadzu X-ray 6000) and Raman spectroscopy (LabRAM HR800, excitation wavelength of 632.8 nm) were used to identify the crystal structures of materials. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM, FEI Sirion field emission) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Tecnai G200 TWIN microscope operated at 200 kV) were applied to characterize the morphological structures of materials.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Zincothermic reduction of SiO2
Molten AlCl3-assisted zincothermic reduction of SiO2 was conducted in an autoclave filled with Ar gas at 250 °C. This approach can directly prepare nano-Si powder and the leachate can recover Zn and AlCl3 (Fig. 1a) via electrolysis. At 250 °C, AlCl3 (melting point 194 °C) turned to a liquid state, forming a good contact between AlCl3 and Zn as well as AlCl3 and SiO2. In this scenario, the zincothermic reduction of SiO2 differs from the traditional metallothermic reduction that involves the direct reduction of metal oxides. The AlCl3-assisted zincothermic reduction employs Zn to reduce the in situ generated SiCl4 gas and the gas–solid reaction has a higher reaction rate than the solid–solid reaction at such a low temperature (Fig. 1b). Using Zn as the reductant, SiO2 was converted to Si (termed ZnR-Si) (Fig. 2a–c), proving the concept of the chlorination–reduction mechanism. Unlike Mg and Al that are more reactive than Si,28 Zn is less reactive than Si so that the reduction cannot occur. Thus, there should be a driving force to make the thermodynamically unfavorable reaction favorable. Since AlCl3 is an oxide ion stealer, SiO2 can react with AlCl3 to generate gaseous SiCl4 and AlOCl and/or Al2O3.

Compared with metallurgical Si (300 mesh), ZnR-Si has a broadened width at half the height and lower peak strength of the diffraction peak (Fig. 2a and b), indicating that ZnR-Si has a smaller particle size than metallurgical Si (JCPDS no. 27-1402).29 The two peaks shift in the low-frequency direction in the Raman spectrum compared to metallurgical Si (Fig. 2c), which also indicates that ZnR-Si has a smaller particle size and nano-structures.30,31 After zincothermic reduction, the gray mixture (AlCl3 + SiO2 + Zn) was transformed into a yellowish Si power (Fig. S2†), and the corresponding crude product XRD patterns are shown in Fig. S2(c).† X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were also performed to analyze ZnR-Si. As shown in Fig. 2d, the XPS survey spectrum shows that ZnR-Si mainly contains Si, O, and C (used to correct the data). As shown in the high-resolution Si 2p XPS spectra (Fig. 2e), two peaks corresponding to elemental Si (Si0) at binding energies of 99.58 and 100.52 eV, others at 101.95 and103.55 eV are referred to SiOx formed by the native oxidation after reduction. No Al and Zn signal are detected from ZnR-Si by XPS indicating complete removal of Al and Zn (Fig. 2f and g). The spherical particle size of SiO2 is approximately 50–100 nm (Fig. 2h) and SiO2 is amorphous (Fig. S1†). The particle size of spheric Zn is about 10–20 μm (Fig. 2i). As shown in Fig. 2j, ZnR-Si mainly consists of hollow Si spheres with a diameter of approximately 10–20 μm. Note that the diameter of the Si sphere is close to that of the Zn precursor, meaning that the reduction reaction occurs at the surface of Zn particles. This means that Zn acts as a template to enable the reduction (Fig. S3†). The diameter of the Si sphere is ∼78 nm (Fig. 2k and l), and the cracks of Si shells allow the Si spheres to come into contact with fresh Zn further and thereby ensure continuous reduction of Si. In addition, ZnR-Si is easy to convert to nano-Si particles via manual grinding (Fig. 2m) because the hollow Si is self-assembled from nano-Si particles (Fig. S3 and S5†). And owing to such a low temperature the nano-size Si particles can hardly aggregate and grow during synthesis. After grinding, the Si particle mean size is about 170 nm (Fig. S4†). The corresponding TEM images (Fig. 2n) further demonstrate the hollow structure of Si (Fig. S5†). A high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image Fig. 2o shows that the interplanar distance of Si is approximately 0.31 nm, which corresponds to the (111) crystal plane of cubic Si. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern reveals that the Si nanosheets consist of aggregated Si polycrystals (Fig. 2p). In addition, an amorphous SiO2 layer of 2 nm thickness was observed on the Si surface, which was caused by exposing to air. Notably, except ZnR-Si, the resultant ZnCl2, AlCl3, and AlOCl are easy to remove in water (Fig. S6†). Since the reduction proceeds from the surface to the inner core of Zn particles, the depth of the reduction relies on the particle size of Zn. The utilization of Zn can be improved by reducing the particle size of Zn.
3.2 Thermodynamic calculations and reduction mechanisms
Thermodynamic calculations were performed to reveal the underlying mechanism of zincothermic reduction. According to the Ellingham diagram28 (Fig. 3a), Zn cannot reduce SiO2 to Si because the Gibbs free energy of the formation of SiO2 is more negative than that of ZnO. The Na line is located above that of Si, meaning that Na cannot reduce SiO2 to Si either. Unlike Na and Zn, Al and Mg lines are located below the Si line, indicating that Mg and Al can reduce SiO2 to Si spontaneously. However, the order of the reduction activity of Si, Na, Mg, and Al in the chlorine potential diagram (Fig. 3b) is different from that in the Ellingham diagram (Fig. 3a). All Zn, Mg, Al, and Na can reduce SiCl4 to Si at a temperature lower than 900 °C. The different reduction activities of these metals in oxygen and chlorine potential diagrams stem from the chemical bonds with different strengths. In other words, the strength of the Si–O bond is stronger than that of Zn–O whereas the strength of the Si–Cl bond is weaker than that of the Zn–Cl bond. As shown in Fig. 3c, AlCl3 reacts with SiO2 to produce SiCl4 and Al2O3 spontaneously when the temperature is higher than 140 °C. In the AlCl3–SiO2–Zn system, the chlorination reaction occurs first to generate SiCl4, and then the zincothermic reduction occurs between Zn and SiCl4. The order of chlorination activity from high to low is CCl4, AlCl3, FeCl3, and ZnCl2. Furthermore, the chlorination activities of various chlorides are shown in Fig. S7.† Since AlCl3 has a high chlorination activity, AlCl3 can convert the ZnO layer at the surface of Zn particles to ZnCl2, ensuring a fresh Zn surface and making the reduction reaction occur continuously. The chlorination reaction was further studied by XRD. AlCl3 can react with SiO2 to generate AlOCl (Fig. 3d) and SiCl4 that is volatile and cannot be detected by XRD. Likewise, AlCl3 reacts with ZnO to generate ZnCl2 and AlOCl, which agrees well with the thermodynamic prediction. Therefore, thermodynamic data indicate that the zincothermic reduction of SiO2 involves a two-step reaction: chlorination and reduction.

According to thermodynamic calculations and XRD results, the overall zincothermic reduction of SiO2 in the presence of AlCl3 can be expressed as eqn (5). The Gibbs free energy of reaction (5) at 250 °C is −91.127 kJ (mol Si)−1, indicating that this reaction takes place spontaneously. 2Zn + 2AlCl3 + SiO2 = 2ZnCl2 + 2AlOCl + Si(5)
In addition to thermodynamics, the kinetics of the reduction is another key factor governing the reduction rate. In a general metallothermic reduction reaction, the reduction rate is determined by the operating temperature, diffusion, phases, etc. In principle, the order of diffusion rates at the interface from high to low is gas–gas, liquid–liquid, and solid–solid. In this regard, changing the state of the interface is one of the effective ways to mitigate the sluggish solid–solid reactions (Fig. 4a). For example, all magnesiothermic reductions of SiO2 to Si are performed at about ∼650 °C because Mg became liquid or gas at such a high temperature18 (Fig. 4b). For zincothermic reduction (Fig. 4c), AlCl3 provides a liquid medium to enable good homogeneity and facilitates mass transfer.22 As shown in Fig. S8,† the less AlCl3 content corresponds to the better crystallization because the AlCl3 salt can absorb heat to prevent crystal growth. Besides, molten AlCl3 enables the chlorination reaction that generates gaseous SiCl4, thereby forming a solid Zn/gaseous SiCl4 interface and enhancing the reduction rate. In addition, AlCl3 can remove ZnO from the surface of Zn particles that avoids the passivation effect. Moreover, Zn cannot react with liquid SiCl4 at 250 °C because of the thick ZnO film.32 Once AlCl3 was added to convert the ZnO film to ZnCl2 the reaction started (Fig. S9†). Note that the generated ZnCl2 and AlCl3 form a eutectic salt (Fig. S10†) that has a melting point lower than 200 °C. This means that the chlorination reaction does not introduce new solid species that may slow down the reduction rate. Therefore, the enhanced reduction rate at such a temperature below the melting temperature of both Zn and SiO2 is ascribed to the generated gaseous SiCl4 intermediate that forms a gas–solid interface. The Si yield is about 30% at 250 °C for 12 h, and the Si yield increases to 90% when increasing the operating temperature to 450 °C.

3.3 Recovery of zinc
A recyclable reductant is key to closing the material cycle. Compared with Mg and Al, Zn is easier to handle and can be produced under relatively mild conditions because Zn can be electroplated in aqueous solutions. With an ever-increasing amount of renewable electricity,4 electrolytic Zn is an ideal electron carrier to enable the reduction in terms of using renewable energy. After zincothermic reduction, Zn was oxidized to ZnCl2 which is highly soluble in water. As shown in Fig. 5a, the dissolved ZnCl2 can be converted to Zn at the cathode and Cl2 at the anode. It was found the electrodeposited Zn can be easily peeled off from the Al substrate (Fig. 5b). There are no obvious dendrites on the surface of the Zn plate (Fig. 5c and d) maybe due to the presence of other salts.33 The current density was 80–90 mA cm−2 (Fig. 5e), suggesting a high recovery rate. Moreover, the obtained deposition is crystalline Zn (Fig. 5f), and the current efficiency of the lab-scale electrolyzer is 78.2%, which can be further optimized by engineering the cell configurations and electrolyte. Furthermore, the Cl2 generated at the anode can be used to convert AlOCl to AlCl3, closing the chloride cycle. Therefore, zincothermic reduction is a green way to produce nano-Si when using Zn as the renewable energy carrier. The preparation of Si powder with different methods and reducing agents is summarized in Table S1.†

(e) Current–time profile corresponding to the quartz electrolysis tank and (f) the corresponding XRD pattern of the Zn plate. 
3.4 Li-storage performance of ZnR-Si
The Li-storage performance of ZnR-Si was evaluated in half-type coin cells. As shown in Fig. 6a, the peak at around 1.1–1.4 V (vs. Li+/Li) in the 1st cycle was attributed to the formation of a solid–electrolyte interface (SEI). The lithiation reaction took place at 0.01–0.3 V, and the delithiation reaction occurred at 0.34–0.54 V, transforming LixSi into amorphous Si. As shown in Fig. 6b, ZnR-Si delivered a reversible specific capacity of 2025, 1858, 1667, 1348, and 1143 mA h g−1 at 0.4, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0, and 6.0 A g−1, respectively. Moreover, the capacity immediately returned to 1757 mA h g−1 when returning the current density from 6 A g−1 to 2 A g−1, and the polarization of voltages at different current densities is small11 (Fig. 6c). The excellent rate capability is due to the nano-particle size of Si particles. The initial discharge capacity was 3597 mA h g−1 with an initial coulombic efficiency (ICE) of ∼69.5% at 0.2 A g−1, and the loss of current efficiency was related to the formation of the SEI.34 The subsequent long-term cycling was performed at a current density of 2 A g−1. Furthermore, the ZnR-Si electrode has excellent cycling stability, which delivered a specific capacity of over 1450 mA h g−1 after 400 cycles (Fig. 6d). We also tested the Li-storage performance of 300-mesh metallurgy Si, which was extremely poor compared with ZnR-Si. This indicates that the enhanced Li-storage performance comes from the small particle size. As shown in Fig. 6e, the ZnR-Si anode has a relatively low charge transfer resistance (Rct) of 89.3 Ω. After 5 cycles, another semicircle appeared and was ascribed to the resistance of the SEI (RSEI), which was 57.6 Ω.35 As shown in Fig. 6f–h, the electrode film retained good integrity and did not have obvious cracks after 400 cycles, meaning that the electrode film can tolerate volume expansion. Before cycling, the thickness of the electrode film was 13.8 μm (Fig. 6i), and the thickness increased to 14.4 μm (Fig. 6j) after 400 cycles, only corresponding to a 4.3% expansion of the thickness. After 400 cycles, the thickness of the electrode film at the fully delithiated state was 14.4 μm and at the fully lithiated state was 15.1 μm (Fig. 6k), which means that the electrode swelling is only 4.9%. Therefore, the excellent cycling stability and high specific capacity of the ZnR-Si anode are attributed to the nano-sized Si that can buffer the volume expansion during lithiation/delithiation cycles.

A full cell was assembled to further evaluate the Li-storage performance of ZnR-Si. As shown in Fig. 7a, the assembled ZnR-Si‖LiCoO2 full-cell can light a blue Light Emitting Diode (LED) lamp. The average discharge voltage of the full-cell is 3.59 V that is slightly lower than the Li‖LiCoO2 half-cell voltage of 3.97 V, and the different cycle charge/discharge profiles are shown in Fig. S11.† Furthermore, the capacity retention rate is 75.6% after 100 cycles at 1C (1C = 140 mA h g−1), showing that ZnR-Si worked in the full cell (Fig. 7c). The first discharge voltage at 0.1C is 3.59 V, discharge capacity is 141 mA h g−1. Using eqn (6), the mass-energy density is calculated to be 506 W h kg−1 (considering only the weight of the electrode materials). E = C(anode+cathode) × Vdischarge(6)

(b) Charge/discharge profiles of the first cycle at 0.1C, (c) long-term cycling performance at 1C (1st cycle at 0.1C) for 100 cycles, (d) rate performance at various rates from 0.2C to 2C (anode: pre-lithiated ZnR-Si and cathode: LiCoO2). The specific capacity is calculated based on the weight of active materials in the cathode. 
This value is approximately 1.5-times more than that of the commercial graphite‖LiCoO2 (335 W h kg−1) system.36 As shown in Fig. 7d, the full-cell delivered a reversible specific capacity of more than 149.6, 131.3, 113.7, 95.4, and 81.1 mA h g−1 at 0.2, 0.5, 1, 1.5, and 2C, respectively. The specific discharge capacity returned back to 107.9 mA h g−1 when returning the rate to 1C, demonstrating the good rate capability of the full cell.
4. Conclusions
Zincothermic reduction has been proven as an effective and direct way to synthesize 170 nm Si powder from SiO2 at 250 °C. Molten AlCl3 is a key enabler to trigger the zincothermic reduction in terms of providing a liquid reaction medium and enabling a combined chlorination–reduction reaction. Thermodynamic calculations reveal that the spontaneous chlorination reaction between AlCl3 and SiO2 generates gaseous SiCl4 that can be reduced to hollow-structured Si by Zn. The surprising finding uncovers the underlying mechanism of the AlCl3-assisted metallothermic reduction of SiO2, which involves both chlorination and reduction. The revealed chlorination–reduction mechanism explains why Zn can convert SiO2 to Si at a relatively low temperature, making the impossible zincothermic reduction of SiO2 possible. In addition, the chlorination reaction turns the solid–solid reaction interface to a gas–solid interface, thereby speeding up the reduction rate. Furthermore, Zn can be recycled from the products of zincothermic reduction, closing the material cycle if renewable electricity was applied. Finally, the obtained ZnR-Si anode delivered a specific capacity of 1450 mA h g−1 at 2 A g−1 after 400 cycles with a capacity retention rate of 97.3%. Overall, this paper not only expands the choice of metal reductants and reveals a chlorination–reduction mechanism of AlCl3-assisted reduction, but also provides a sustainable way to prepare nano-Si or other functional materials with rationally designed structures and properties under milder conditions than conventional ways.
