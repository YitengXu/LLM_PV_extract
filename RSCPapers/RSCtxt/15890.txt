    , Accepted 7th April 2014First published on 30th June 2014AbstractWe found that Cd0.5Zn0.5S–ZnS core (4.2 nm in diameter)–shell (1.2 nm in thickness) quantum dots (QDs) demonstrated a typical energy-down-shift (2.76–4.96 → 2.81 eV), which absorb ultra-violet (UV) light (250–450 nm in wavelength) and emit blue visible light (∼442 nm in wavelength). They showed the quantum yield of ∼80% and their coating on the SiNX film textured p-type silicon solar-cells enhanced the external-quantum-efficiency (EQE) of ∼30% at 300–450 nm in wavelength, thereby enhancing the short-circuit-current-density (JSC) of ∼2.23 mA cm−2 and the power-conversion-efficiency (PCE) of ∼1.08% (relatively ∼6.04% increase compared with the reference without QDs for p-type silicon solar-cells). In particular, the PCE peaked at a specific coating thickness of the Cd0.5Zn0.5S–ZnS core–shell QD layer; i.e., the 1.08% PCE enhancement at the 8.8 nm thick QD layer.
Introduction
For the past few decades, silicon solar-cells have been researched to improve PCE through surface texturing,1 anti-reflection coating,2 plasma doping, a selective emitter,3,4 a back contact cell,5,6 a local contact cell,7 and metallization. Eventually, silicon solar-cells have been saturated with the maximum PCE value of ∼25%.8 Recently, research on the energy-down-shift via implementing QDs in silicon solar-cells has been proposed to overcome the saturation of the PCE in silicon solar-cells since QDs are able to absorb UV light and emit visible light.9–17 However, they have not reported an evident PCE improvement and clear mechanism. Thus, we implemented the energy-down-shift via Cd0.5Zn0.5S–ZnS core–shell QDs on silicon solar-cells where the Cd0.5Zn0.5S core was coated with a ZnS shell layer. First, the absorption of UV light and visible light emission via Cd0.5Zn0.5S–ZnS core–shell QDs was investigated by UV-visible spectroscopy and photo-luminescence spectroscopy. In addition, the dependency of the light absorption, surface reflectance and EQE on the concentration of Cd0.5Zn0.5S–ZnS core–shell QDs was estimated as a function of the light wavelength. Finally, the photo-voltaic (PV) performance dependency of silicon solar-cells on the concentration of Cd0.5Zn0.5S–ZnS core–shell QDs was evaluated and the mechanism by which Cd0.5Zn0.5S–ZnS core–shell QDs affect the PV performance was reviewed in detail.
Results and discussion
The core–shell QDs were spin-coated on SiNX film deposited textured p-type silicon solar-cells, as shown in Fig. 1a. They were well coated along the SiNX film textured surface where Al and Pt were deposited on the QD layer to avoid the focus-ion-beam damage during the transmission-electron-microscope (TEM) sample preparation, as shown in Fig. 1b. The core–shell QDs showed a spherical shape, were well crystallized, and well dispersed with each other, as shown in Fig. 1c. The average size of the Cd0.5Zn0.5S–ZnS core–shell QDs was 6.6 nm (4–9 nm), measured by TEM, as shown in Fig. 1d. The chemical composition of the core–shell QD was Cd0.5Zn0.5S and ZnS, characterized by the energy-dispersive-X-ray-spectroscopy (EDX) line-scan profile and X-ray diffraction (XRD), as shown in Fig. 1e–f. The chemical composition results of EDX show clear evidence of core–shell QDs. Note that the ZnS atomic percent of the core QD includes the ZnS atomic percent of the shell so that the composition of the core–shell QD is Cd0.5Zn0.5S. In addition, the XRD exhibited the peaks of (100), (002), (110), and (112) for the core QD at 26.44°, 28.22°, 46.66°, and 55.43° of 2 theta (JCPDS Cards: 01-9251), as shown in Fig. 1f. In addition, it presented the peaks of (111), (220), and (311) for the shell QD at 28.26°, 46.99°, and 55.74° of 2 theta (JCPDS Cards: 12-6328). The XRD results confirmed that the chemical composition of the core–shell QD was Cd0.5Zn0.5S–ZnS. The TEM, EDX, and XRD characterization of the core–shell QD indicates that the 4.2 nm thick core Cd0.5Zn0.5S was well coated with the 1.2 nm thick shell ZnS layer. Since the energy band-gap of the ZnS (∼4.12 eV)18 shell layer is higher than that of the Cd0.5Zn0.5S (∼2.81 eV)19 core QD and the core QD diameter (∼4.2 nm) is considerably small, both the above conduction energy band and under valance energy band in the Cd0.5Zn0.5S core QD would be easily quantized, as shown in Fig. 1g. This energy band diagram of the Cd0.5Zn0.5S–ZnS core–shell QD explained that the quam-confined Cd0.5Zn0.5S QD would emit a blue light (442 nm in wavelength) when the ZnS shell QD absorbs the UV light having the wavelength of less than 450 nm. The visible light emitted by the Cd0.5Zn0.5S–ZnS core–shell QDs via energy-down-shift is re-absorbed into the surface of a p-type silicon solar-cell.

To prove the re-absorption of the visible light emitted from the Cd0.5Zn0.5S–ZnS core–shell QDs via an energy-down-shift, first, the absorption of UV light and the emission of visible light from the Cd0.5Zn0.5S–ZnS core–shell QDs were investigated by UV visible spectroscopy and photo-luminescence (PL) spectroscopy, as shown in Fig. 2a. The Cd0.5Zn0.5S–ZnS core–shell QDs in the quartz-cuvette emitted the 442 nm blue light when the 365 nm UV light was exposed into the quartz-cuvette, as shown in the photo-image of the quartz-cuvette in Fig. 2a. The 0.03 wt% Cd0.5Zn0.5S–ZnS core–shell QDs in the quartz-cuvette absorbed ∼100% UV light from ∼450 to 250 nm in wavelength (denoted in a red solid line in Fig. 2a) and the 0.001 wt% Cd0.5Zn0.5S–ZnS core–shell QDs absorbed less than 40% UV light from 400 to 250 nm (denoted in a red dotted line in Fig. 2a). The 0.03 wt% Cd0.5Zn0.5S–ZnS core–shell QDs in the quartz-cuvette peaked at the 442 nm PL with the quantum yield of 48% (denoted in a blue solid line in Fig. 2a) while the 0.001 wt% Cd0.5Zn0.5S–ZnS core–shell QDs peaked at the 442 nm PL with the quantum yield of 80% (denoted in a blue dotted line in Fig. 2a). The absorption and PL results are well correlated with the energy band diagram of the Cd0.5Zn0.5S–ZnS core–shell QDs in Fig. 1(g). These results evidently indicated that the Cd0.5Zn0.5S–ZnS core–shell QDs emitted the blue light (∼442 nm in wavelength) when the UV light (250–450 nm in wavelength) is absorbed, proving the energy-down-shift of the Cd0.5Zn0.5S–ZnS core–shell QDs. The dependency of the light absorption amount of the Cd0.5Zn0.5S–ZnS core–shell QDs on the concentration (wt%) of the QD solution was estimated as a function of the wavelength when the QD solutions were spin-coated on glass, as shown in Fig. 2b, the absorption amount of the UV light between 250 and 450 nm in wavelength increased with the wt% of the QD solution. In particular, the absorption amount of the UV light at ∼0.5 wt% was ∼80%. In addition, the light absorption wavelength was shifted toward longer wavelength when the QD concentration increased, so that the light absorption amount between 450 and 800 nm in wavelength increased with the wt% of the QD solution, which negatively affects the JSC in silicon solar-cells.

To estimate the dependency of the surface reflectance on the concentration (wt%) of the QD solution, the spin-coated amount on the textured surface of silicon solar cells was relatively estimated by measuring the area of the spin-coated QD layer at the textured pyramid using the TEM observation, as shown in Fig. 3a (see Fig. S1, ESI†). It slightly increased with the QD solution concentration up to 0.2 wt% and then rapidly increased with the QD solution concentration from 0.3 to 0.5 wt%, since the QD layer thickness increase at the valley of textured pyramid was higher than that at the side surface of the textured pyramid. In addition, the average thickness of the QD layer was well correlated with the area of the spin-coated QD layer. As shown in Fig. 3b, the dependency of the surface reflectance of the textured silicon solar-cells on the average QD layer thickness was estimated as a function of wavelength. The surface reflectance between 250 and 400 nm in wavelength rapidly decreased with an increase in the thickness of the average QD layer while, as shown in the inset box of Fig. 3b, the wavelength between 400 and 1000 nm slightly increased with the average QD layer thickness. Note that a lower surface reflectance corresponds to a higher level of light absorption. This result indicates that the UV light absorption between 250 and 400 nm in wavelength would increase rapidly with the average QD layer thickness, but when the wavelength was between 400 and 1000 nm, it would decrease slightly with an increase in the thickness of the average QD layer. This was because of an increase in the scattering at the QD layer.

(a) Average area and thickness of the coated Cd0.5Zn0.5S–ZnS core–shell QD layer on textured pyramid and (b) surface reflectance dependency on Cd0.5Zn0.5S–ZnS core–shell QD layer thickness. 
For p-type silicon solar-cells coated with the QD layer, the detailed dependency of EQE on the area of the spin-coated QD layer at the average QD layer thickness is as shown in Fig. 4. The EQE in the UV light wavelength (between 250 and 450 nm) rapidly increased with the average QD layer thickness; it increased from ∼30 to ∼63%, as shown in the right upper box of Fig. 4. However, the EQE in the visible wavelength (between 500 and 800 nm) slightly decreased with an increase in the thickness of the average QD layer, as shown in the right lower box of Fig. 4. A comparison of Fig. 3b and 4 indicates that the dependency of EQE on the average QD layer thickness is well correlated with that of the surface reflectance on the average QD layer thickness. Note that a lower level of surface reflectance leads to a higher EQE. In addition, this result demonstrated the energy-down-shift via the Cd0.5Zn0.5S–ZnS core–shell QDs in the UV wavelength region (300–450 nm). However, the presence of the Cd0.5Zn0.5S–ZnS core–shell QDs slightly decreased the EQE in the visible wavelength region.

For p-type silicon solar-cells coated with the QD layer, the dependency of PV performance, such as the J–V curve, JSC, open-circuit-voltage (VOC), fill-factor (FF) and PCE, on the average QD layer thickness was shown in Fig. 5. The value of JSC increased abruptly from 34.70 to 36.94 mA cm−2 as the QD layer thickness increased up to ∼8.8 nm (see the inset of Fig. 5a ①–⑤), which was a ∼6.45% increase compared to the reference without the QD layer. This result evidently showed the JSC increase induced by the energy-down-shift via the Cd0.5Zn0.5S–ZnS core–shell QDs. However, JSC slightly decreased from 36.94 to 36.18 mA cm−2 as the QD layer thickness increased from 8.8 to 27.0 nm (see the inset of Fig. 5a⑤–⑦). This result would be associated with the surface reflectance increase (or EQE increase) in the visible wavelength region (450–800 nm) although the surface reflectance in the UV wavelength region greatly decreased or the EQE in the UV wavelength region greatly increased. However, VOC was independent of thickness of the QD layer, as shown in Fig. 5b. In addition, as shown in Fig. 5b, FF very slightly decreased upon increasing the QD layer thickness. Finally, PCE rapidly increased from 16.92 to 18.00% as the QD layer thickness increased up to 8.8 nm; a 1.08% PCE increase at 8.8 nm corresponds to relatively 6.4% PCE enhancement compared with that in the reference (without the QD layer). It slightly decreased from 18.00 to 17.23% as the QD layer thickness increased from 8.8 to 27.0 nm. The dependency of PCE on the QD layer thickness is well correlated with that of EQE on the QD layer thickness, in which both JSC and PCE peak at 8.8 nm in the QD layer thickness. These results indicate that the coating of Cd0.5Zn0.5S–ZnS core–shell QDs on the SiNX film textured surface for p-type silicon solar-cells directly affects JSC due to the energy-down-shift effect of Cd0.5Zn0.5S–ZnS core–shell QDs but it does not affect VOC and FF.

Experimental
Quantum dot synthesis
Cd0.5Zn0.5S–ZnS core–shell QDs were synthesized by a hot injection method. For the Cd0.5Zn0.5S core, 1 mmol of cadmium oxide (CdO), 7.5 mL of oleic acid (OA), and 10 mmol of zinc acetate (Zn(acet)2) were mixed at room temperature and reacted at 150 °C. After being reached 150 °C, the reaction flask was degassed under a pressure of 100 mTorr for 20 min, filled with N2 gas, and injected with 15 mL of 1-octadecene (1-ODE). Subsequently, the distilled mixture chemical was heated up to 300 °C to form a clear solution of Cd(OA)2 and Zn(OA)2, and then N2 purged sulfur (S) solution where 2 mmol of S powder dissolved in 3 mL of 1-ODE was quickly injected into the reaction flask and reacted. After injecting S precursors first, the temperature of the reaction flask was elevated to 310 °C for further growth of Cd0.5Zn0.5S core quantum-dots (nucleation process). After the elapse of the reaction for 8 min, N2 purged S solution where 8 mmol of S powder dissolved in 3 mL of tributyl phosphine (TBP) was introduced into the reactor to overcoat the existing Cd0.5Zn0.5S core with a ZnS shell without any purification steps. After elapsing for 40 min to generate the ZnS shell, the solution dispersed with QDs was cooled down at room temperature and then centrifuged with an excessive amount of ethanol to eliminate the impurities. Finally, the precipitated QDs were re-dispersed with chloroform (see Fig. S2, ESI†). The detailed morphology, composition ratio, size distribution, absorbance, photo-luminescence (PL), and fluorescence quantum yield (QY) for QDs were characterized by XRD (Rigaku, ATX-G), TEM at 200 kV in acceleration voltage, EDX, UV-visible spectroscopy, and photo-luminescence spectroscopy using a HeCd laser source with a 325 nm wavelength, respectively. The quantum yield (QY) of the QDs was estimated by comparing the PL intensity with that of primary standard solutions (Rhodamine 6G, QY = 95% in ethanol) at the same optical density (optical density = 0.05) and excitation wavelength (325 nm).
Solar-cell fabrication
Czochralski-single-crystal silicon-wafers doped with boron (10 Ω cm) were used with an area of 20 × 20 mm2 and 200 μm in thickness. The wafers were etched using KOH at 80 °C for 10 min to produce a random pyramid textured surface. The wafers were followed by a POCl3 diffusion at 790 °C for 15 min to deposit the dopant and drive-in at 860 °C for 5 min to produce a ∼0.5 μm thick n-doping layer achieving an emitter resistance of 58 Ω □−1. Afterward, the wafers were etched using diluted hydrofluoric acid to remove phosphorous-silicate-glass (PSG) film. A 95 nm thick SiNX film was deposited by low-frequency plasma-enhanced-chemical-vapor-deposition (PECVD). To form top and bottom electrodes, the wafers were subjected to screen-printing using Ag and Al paste. Finally, the wafers were fired using rapid-thermal-annealing (RTA) at 680 °C for 1 s, which enabled p-type silicon solar-cells to be fabricated. The QD solutions (0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.5 wt%) were dropped and spin-coated at 1000 rpm for 60 s on textured SiNX film in a p-type silicon solar-cell. The p-type silicon solar-cells were then annealed at 95 °C for 10 min to dry the solvent of the QD solution. To correlate the optical characteristics between QDs in solvent and the QD layer on the silicon solar cell, the thickness of QD layer after spin-coating was measured by TEM. The thicknesses of the QD layer for the QD solution of 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.5 wt% were 5.1, 6.3, 7.9, 8.8, 12.6 and 27.09 nm at the QD layer, respectively. The surface reflectance of the pyramid-textured surface was estimated by using UV-visible light spectrometry (Varian Cary-5000 UV-Visible Spectrophotometer). External-quantum-efficiency (EQE, McScience K3100) and PV performance (McScience LAB-160) such as JSC, VOC, FF, and PCE for silicon solar-cells were estimated using a solar simulator.
Conclusions
For the p-type silicon solar-cells coated with the Cd0.5Zn0.5S–ZnS core–shell QD layer on the SiNX film textured surface, the energy-down-shift, i.e., from 2.76–4.96 to 2.81 eV, via the Cd0.5Zn0.5S–ZnS core–shell QDs enhanced the PCE of ∼1.08% (relatively 6.40% compared to the reference without QDs) since the Cd0.5Zn0.5S–ZnS core–shell QDs mainly absorb the UV light (250–450 nm in wavelength) and then emit the blue light (∼442 nm in wavelength) through the SiNX film textured surface so that they enhance the EQE in the UV light region (300–450 nm in wavelength) of the silicon solar-cells. In addition, the PCE peaks at a specific core–shell QD layer thickness, i.e., 8.8 nm (corresponding to 0.2 wt% of QDs) since the thickness higher than 12.6 nm of the QD layer enhances the visible light absorption (450–1000 nm in wavelength) although it increases the UV light absorption (300–450 nm in wavelength). The EQE at the UV light region (300–450 nm in wavelength) could not achieve ∼100% since the quantum yield of Cd0.5Zn0.5S–ZnS core–shell QDs coated on the SiNX film textured surface would be much less than ∼80% because of the reabsorption of the emitted blue light from the core–shell QDs into near core–shell QDs and the loss of the emitted blue light from the core–shell QDs into air (see Fig. S3, ESI†). In addition, at the UV light region it could not achieve ∼100% since the ideal EQE at the wavelength of the emitted light (442 nm) from QDs for p-type silicon solar-cells was ∼75% (see Fig. S4, ESI†). Thus, the energy-down-shift effect via Cd0.5Zn0.5S–ZnS core–shell QDs ideally could enhance only the EQE of ∼36%, which is almost correlated with the practical EQE (∼30%) for the p-type silicon solar-cell coated with Cd0.5Zn0.5S–ZnS core–shell QDs (see Fig. 5). However, the Cd0.5Zn0.5S–ZnS core–shell QDs (1.08%) showed a slightly better PCE than CdSe–ZnS core–shell QDs (0.91%) (see Fig. S5, ESI†). To maximize the quantum yield of QDs coated on the SiNX film textured surface it is necessary to coat the core–shell QD avoiding the reabsorption of the emitted blue light from the core–shell QDs into near core–shell QDs. In addition, the primary challenge remaining is to capture all of the isotropically emitted luminescence from the QD layer. Furthermore, the photopatternable core–shell QD20 to maximize the quantum yield or a larger energy-down-shift absorbing UV light and emitting green or red light using doped core–shell QDs21,22 is essential to further enhance the PCE of p-type silicon solar cells. Note that CdSe–ZnS QDs absorb the blue and UV light (550–250 nm in wavelength) and emit the green light (542 nm in wavelength) with the quantum yield of 74.1% (see Fig. S4, ESI†).
