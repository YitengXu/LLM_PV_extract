    , Accepted 23rd March 2017First published on 31st March 2017AbstractIn this article, we demonstrate for the first time a mesoscopic printable perovskite solar cell (PSC) using NiO as the hole transporting material and low-temperature processed carbon as the counter electrode. A single deposition method assisted by N2 blow drying was used for the deposition of MAPbI3 on a TiO2/ZrO2/NiO screen-printed electrode. As the final step a low-temperature processing (i.e. 75 °C) carbon counter layer was fabricated on MAPbI3 by a blade coating method. It is found that the capping layer thickness of MAPbI3 has a significant effect on the device efficiency, especially when NiO is introduced as a hole transporting material into the structure. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy demonstrates good charge transport characteristics for the device with a thin MAPbI3 capping layer obtained by the N2 blow drying method. Our best performing device demonstrated a remarkable photovoltaic performance with a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 22.38 mA cm−2, an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.97 V, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.50 corresponding to a photo-conversion efficiency (PCE) of 10.83%. Moreover, the un-encapsulated device exhibited advantageous stability over 1000 h in air in the dark.
Introduction
In 2009, Miyasaka et al. were the first to report the light harvesting properties of CH3NH3PbX3 (X = Br and I) organic–inorganic lead halide perovskite materials when they were used as sensitizers in a liquid electrolyte based dye-sensitized solar cell.1 However, corrosion of CH3NH3PbX3 by the polar I−/I3− electrolyte hindered the interest of this new sensitizer until the possibility of replacing this electrolyte with a solid organic hole transport material (HTM), spiro-OMeTAD for higher device stability and efficiency was realized in 2012.2
Exploration of inorganic HTMs to replace the existing high-cost organic solid HTMs is vastly important in present perovskite solar research because of their advantages as low-cost alternatives to expensive organic–inorganic perovskite solar cells (PSCs).3,4 So far, the reported PSCs with best efficiencies use expensive organic HTMs, such as 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD), poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS), poly-3-hexylthiophene (P3HT) and poly-triarylamine (PTAA) and Au back contact.5–9 The use of these costly organic HTMs and metal back contacts which are processed using vacuum evaporation techniques is a potential hurdle for large-scale production and practical applications because of their high materials and processing cost.10,11 Moreover, widely used spiro-OMeTAD hole conductors are not only expensive but can cause moisture-induced degradation in PSCs.12 Recent studies have indicated the viability of replacing these costly organic HTMs with low-cost inorganic HTMs such as CuI,13 CuCNS,14,15 Cu2O/CuO,16 and NiO.17,18
However, HTM-free mesoscopic PSCs are also possible due to the unique ambipolar nature of perovskite (e.g., CH3NH3PbI3 or MAPbI3) which can serve as both a light harvester and hole transporter.19 The first HTM-free PSC was reported by Etgar et al. and achieved about 10% of PCE using a Au back contact.20 Although, in this device, Au deposition requires a high-vacuum and high-cost evaporation technique which hinders the industrial interest. Carbon can be an ideal material to substitute Au as a back contact in PSCs because of its low cost, abundance, excellent stability, facile processability and similar functionality to Au.21,22 In 2013, Han et al. reported a HTM free monolithic type PSC by substituting Au with low-cost carbon by a screen-printing technique which showed a PCE of 6.64%.23 After one year, the same group reported a PCE of 12.84% by using a (5-AVA)x(MA)1−xPbI3 light absorber.24 Interestingly, these carbon-based PSCs have shown promising stability under long-term light soaking and long-term heat exposure with an exceptional self-life in air in the dark.25 A recent study conducted by Wang's group demonstrated that the efficiency of these types of mesoscopic PSCs can be improved by introducing a p-type NiO layer in between the separator (i.e. ZrO2) and the carbon counter electrode layer due to the accelerated charge extraction to the external circuit.18 In these types of mesoscopic PSC structures, the perovskite is formed at the last step by infiltrating the perovskite solution through the porous carbon counter electrode. Therefore, the porosity and the thickness of the carbon layer always determine the perovskite penetration towards the TiO2. Besides, it is very common to observe partial surface coverage and poor pore filling of perovskite on mesoporous layers due to the inhomogeneous crystallisation kinetics in the one-step deposition method and anisotropic growth in the two-step deposition method.26 Due to these practical issues, obtaining a higher device efficiency is quite challenging with this monolithic type mesoscopic PSC structure. Furthermore, this effect is more pronounced when an additional p-type NiO as the HTM is present in the cell structure.
The ability to process carbon electrodes at a low temperature (70–100 °C) on top of the CH3NH3PbI3 layer without destroying its structure is one of the solutions for the aforementioned issues related to mesoscopic PSCs employed with high temperature processed carbon counter electrodes. Very recently, researchers developed low-temperature processing carbon inks with the possibility of coating the carbon electrode on the perovskite layer by printing methods. Ma et al. successfully fabricated a HTM free PSC using low-temperature processing carbon paste made by modifying a commercially available carbon ink. The meso-TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3/carbon device based on a low-temperature-processed carbon electrode achieved a PCE of 9.08% with an advantageous stability (over 2000 h) in air in the dark.27 Similarly, a PCE of 8.31% was reported for a TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3/carbon structured PSC by Yang's group using commercially available low-temperature processing carbon paste.28 Liu et al. fabricated low-temperature processing carbon paste by employing different sizes of graphite powder and carbon black. Their HTM free PSCs exhibited over 1300 h stability in air in the dark without encapsulation, with an optimal PCE of 6.88%.29 In 2016, Yang et al. reported a PCE of 8.09% for MAPbBr3-based HTM-free PSCs using commercially available low-temperature processing carbon paint.26 Huang's group reported a chlorobenzene based solvent-assisted method to fabricate HTM-free PSCs with low-temperature processing carbon counter electrodes and showed a higher PCE of 11.44%.30 Very recently, a boost in the device efficiency of HTM-free mesoscopic solar cells with low-temperature processing carbon electrode was achieved by a solvent engineering method. In their work, they replaced iso-propanol with iso-propanol/cyclohexane to formulate the MAI solution for the second step of the sequential method in order to obtain a high-quality perovskite layer for the paintable carbon-based PSCs. An impressive PCE over 14% was reported and it is the highest reported device efficiency of HTM free mesoscopic PSCs to date.31,32
It is widely accepted that the PCE of these mesoscopic PSCs can be improved by introducing a p-type HTM layer as the electron blocking or hole extraction layer.33 Due to the wide bandgap, and excellent thermal and chemical stability of the p-type NiO, it is enormously attractive as the HTM for mesoscopic PSCs.17,34 However, in most cases, the effect of the p-type NiO layer is hindered due to the formation of a thick perovskite capping layer by commonly used one-step and two-step deposition methods. Herein, we demonstrate for the first time, the possibility of incorporation of the p-type NiO layer as an inorganic HTM for mesoscopic PSCs using low-temperature processing carbon as the counter electrode. A modified one-step deposition assisted by a N2 blow drying technique was used for the deposition of CH3NH3PbI3 on a TiO2/ZrO2/NiO screen-printed electrode followed by printing the low-temperature processing carbon electrode on the perovskite layer by a doctor-blade method. For this device structure, a remarkable PCE of 10.8% was achieved with a significant improvement in the photocurrent and voltage due to the excellent hole extraction or electron blocking by the p-type NiO layer. Hence, using p-type NiO as the HTM for mesoscopic PSCs will enable enhanced device performance with a low production cost, realising a more encouraging prospect for the commercialization of this photovoltaic technology.
Experimental
Solar cell fabrication
The fabricating steps of printable PSCs; fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass substrates were etched with a laser before being cleaned ultrasonically with detergent, deionized water and ethanol successively. Then, the substrates were coated with a TiO2 compact layer by aerosol spray pyrolysis using a precursor containing 300 μL of titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) and 4 mL of EtOH followed by TiCl4 treatment (using a 70 mM TiCl4 aqueous solution at 70 °C for 10 min). The treated film was annealed at 500 °C for 30 min inside an oven. Then, the mesoporous TiO2 layer was deposited by screen printing using a TiO2 paste (3 g of F-6 powder (Showa Titanium) with 0.5 ml of acetic acid, 15 mL of ethyl cellulose (45–55 mPa s, TCI, 10 wt% in EtOH) and 50 g of α-terpineol). After the coating, the film was dried at 125 °C for 5 min and sintered at 500 °C for 30 min using an oven. After being sintered at 500 °C for 30 min, a ZrO2 space layer was printed on the top of the mesoporous TiO2 layer using a ZrO2 paste (3 g of ZrO2 powder (40–50 nm, Alfa Aesar) with 0.5 ml of acetic acid, 15 mL of ethyl cellulose (45–55 mPa s, TCI, 10 wt% in EtOH) and 50 g of α-terpineol). The film was annealed at 400 °C for 30 min inside an oven after drying at 125 °C for 5 min on a hot plate. After that, the NiO mesoporous layer was coated on the ZrO2 layer using a NiO paste consisting 3 g of NiO powder (20 nm, Iolitec Ionic Liquids Technologies GmbH) with 0.5 ml of acetic acid, 15 mL of ethyl cellulose (45–55 mPa s, TCI, 10 wt% in EtOH) and 50 g of α-terpineol on top of the ZrO2 layer. After the pre-drying at 125 °C, the NiO layer was sintered at 500 °C for 30 min using an oven. Then, the CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3) perovskite light absorber was coated by a modified one-step drop casting method assisted by a N2 blow drying technique inside a N2 filled glove box (average humidity ∼ 25%). The MAPbI3·DMF complex (TCI) was used to prepare a 2.2 M concentrated MAPbI3 solution in a DMF:DMSO (9:1) mixed solvent. MAPbI3 coating was performed by dropping 2 μL of MAPbI3 onto the mesoporous electrode two times with a 2 min interval. After the MAPbI3 coating, the electrode was transferred to a heated hotplate at 60 °C and blow-dried using a continuous N2 flow for around 10 s (until the film colour changes to light brown). Then the film was annealed at 60 °C for 10 min and 100 °C for another 10 min. After the annealing, the film was taken out from the glove box for the carbon counter electrode coating. As the final step of PSC fabrication, a low-temperature processing carbon paste was coated on the electrode by a doctor blade method. The low-temperature processing carbon paste was prepared by mixing 3 g of Printex L6 carbon (Evonik Industries), 7 g of graphite powder, 4 g of graphite flakes (∼325 mesh, Alfa Aesar), 1.5 g of ZrO2 (40–50 nm, Alfa Aesar), 1 g of hydroxyl cellulose (3.0–5.9 mPa s, Wako), 30 g of α-terpineol and 30 g of ethyl cellulose (45–55 mPa s, TCI, 10 wt% in EtOH) by a pot milling method. Pot milling was conducted for 2 h at 280 rpm speed. After mixing, the paste was sonicated by adding EtOH (total volume up to 100 mL) using a sonicator probe for 10 min with 5 s intervals. Finally, EtOH was removed from the paste by evaporation. The sheet resistance of the 25 μm thick carbon film was 11.7 ± 5 Ω □−1 (after annealing at 75 °C for 30 min). After coating the carbon counter electrode, the completed device was annealed at 75 °C for 30 min. Finally, the carbon coated side of the device was soldered for better electrical contact before the device characterization. An FTO/glass substrate with dimensions of 10 cm × 3.5 cm was used to print 10 devices. The substrate size of a device was 2 cm × 1.75 cm.
Device characterization
Photovoltaic measurements were conducted using an AM 1.5 solar simulator equipped with a xenon lamp (Yamashita Denso, Japan). The power of the simulated light was calibrated to 100 mW cm−2 by a reference Si photodiode (Bunkou Keiki, Japan). J–V curves were obtained by applying an external bias to the cell and the generated photocurrent was measured with an APCMT Japan 6240 DC voltage current source. IPCE was measured using a 300 W xenon light source and a monochromator (M10, Bunkoukeiki). The SEM images were obtained by using JSM-6510, JOEL-JSM-7001FA scanning electron microscopes and EDX was measured using a TE3030, Hitachi machine. The impedance spectra were measured by an electrochemical analyser (SP-150, Bio-logic SAS) and the parameters were fitted using Z-View software.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1a schematically illustrates the mesoscopic TiO2/ZrO2/NiO/MAPbI3 heterojunction solar cell based on low-temperature processing carbon as the counter electrode. The mesoporous ZrO2 layer prevents the direct contact between mesoporous TiO2 and NiO layers. Upon illumination, the perovskite light absorber (i.e. MAPbI3) in the mesoporous layers gets excited and generates free charge carriers. The electrons are extracted to the FTO through TiO2 (processes 1 and 2), separating the electrons from the holes in MAPbI3. The remaining holes in the MAPbI3 layer can possibly transport to the carbon counter electrode through MAPbI3 itself (process 3) or through the hole conducting p-type NiO layer (process 4).24 The energy levels of the materials used to fabricate the solar cells are depicted in Fig. 1b. The valence band (VB) and conduction band (CB) of the MAPbI3 are −5.4 and −3.9 eV, versus vacuum, respectively.35 Once illuminated by sunlight, the MAPbI3 gets excited from the ground state to excited state by generating electron/hole pairs in the MAPbI3 layer. Immediately, the electron–hole pairs separate by injecting electrons into TiO2 (−4.2 eV) and transporting the holes directly to the carbon counter electrode (−5.0 eV) or via the hole conducting NiO layer (−5.2 eV).36 The key fabrication steps of our PSCs with a low-temperature processing carbon counter electrode are shown in Fig. 1c. As represented in the figure, firstly a TiO2 compact layer is deposited by spray deposition on a partly etched fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrate followed by screen printing of mesoscopic TiO2 (as the electron transport layer), ZrO2 (as a separator and scaffold) and the hole transporting NiO layer. Then, the MAPbI3 was formed on this scaffold by a one-step deposition method assisted with N2 blow drying in order to fabricate a smooth, uniform perovskite layer with a thin capping layer. Finally, low-temperature processing carbon paste was directly printed onto the NiO/MAPbI3 by a doctor blade method as the counter electrode.

Fig. 2a displays cross-sectional SEM images of successive layers in the c-TiO2/m-TiO2/m-ZrO2/m-NiO/MAPbI3/carbon hetero-junction solar cell. The thickness of compact TiO2 is approximately 50 nm and the thicknesses of mesoscopic screen-printed TiO2, ZrO2 and NiO are approximately 350 nm, 1 μm and 200 nm respectively. The MAPbI3 perovskite is infiltrated into the pore of the TiO2/ZrO2/NiO scaffold. Fig. 2b and c show a comparison of the uniformity of the MAPbI3 layer forming on the TiO2/ZrO2/NiO scaffold without and with N2 blow drying respectively. As shown in Fig. 2b, large crystals of MAPbI3 can be observed on top of the mesoscopic scaffold with a wide range of sizes between 1–2.5 μm when the perovskite layer was formed without N2 blow drying (by drop casting). Whereas, a smooth and uniform perovskite layer with a thin capping layer was perceived when employing N2 blow drying for the MAPbI3 layer formation in the mesoscopic solar cells. Fig. 2d shows the improved attachment of the carbon layer with the smooth layer of MAPbI3 obtained with the N2 blow drying method. A cross-sectional image of the completed printable PSC is shown in Fig. 2e and the thickness of the doctor bladed carbon counter electrode is estimated to be ∼60 μm. EDX mapping image in Fig. 2f confirms the infiltration of MAPbI3 towards the inner mesoscopic layers of the device.

The photocurrent density–voltage characteristic (JV) curves of c-TiO2/m-TiO2/ZrO2/MAPbI3/carbon and c-TiO2/m-TiO2/ZrO2/NiO/MAPbI3/carbon solar cells with and without employing N2 blow drying during MAPbI3 formation are shown in Fig. 3 and the average photovoltaic results are summarised in Table 1. The JV plots of c-TiO2/m-TiO2/ZrO2/MAPbI3/carbon and c-TiO2/m-TiO2/ZrO2/NiO/MAPbI3/carbon cells fabricated using N2 blow drying are demonstrated in Fig. 3a. The device without NiO (c-TiO2/m-TiO2/ZrO2/MAPbI3/carbon) showed an average Jsc of 14.48 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.84 V and a fill factor of 0.49, leading to a relatively poor average PCE of 5.96%. When the NiO is introduced (c-TiO2/m-TiO2/ZrO2/NiO/MAPbI3/carbon), the PCE of the device significantly improved from 5.96 to 10.35% with an increase in the Jsc (i.e. from 14.48 to 21.94 cm−2) and Voc (i.e. 0.84 to 0.96 V). Fig. 3b indicates the photovoltaic performance of the c-TiO2/m-TiO2/ZrO2/NiO/MAPbI3/carbon device without utilising N2 for MAPbI3 layer formation. In this controlled device, the MAPbI3 was formed by simply drop casting MAPbI3 solution onto the mesoscopic scaffold. For this cell, an average PCE of 7.63% was achieved with a Jsc of 18.66 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.82 V and a fill factor of 0.5.

We believe that the variation in the photovoltaic performance of the devices made with and without employing N2 during the MAPbI3 fabrication is mainly corresponding to the capping layer thickness of MAPbI3 on the mesoscopic scaffold as evidenced by the SEM images (Fig. 2b and c). For more clarity, it is schematically illustrated in Fig. 4. In the absence of a hole conducting NiO layer, the photo-generated holes are extracted and transported towards the carbon counter electrode by the MAPbI3 layer due to its ambipolar nature (Fig. 4a). On the other hand, when a hole conducting layer (i.e. p-type NiO) is present in the structure, these photo-generated holes are collected much faster and transported to the carbon counter electrode efficiently. Due to this efficient charge collection and transport assisted by the hole conducting NiO layer, the Jsc and Voc of the solar cell significantly improved compared to the device without the NiO layer. Interestingly, there was no significant improvement in the PCE observed for the same device structure (c-TiO2/m-TiO2/ZrO2/NiO/MAPbI3/carbon) when N2 blow drying was not employed in the MAPbI3 formation. This observation clearly indicates that the capping layer thickness of MAPbI3, as well as the connection of the MAPbI3/carbon interface, is highly affecting the effect of NiO in mesoscopic PSCs. Previous studies have confirmed that N2 blow drying techniques result in a smooth and thin capping perovskite layer with long grain crystals compared to the drop casting method by flushing the excess perovskite solution from the photoelectrode surface.37,38 This phenomenon is clearly observed in our study as evidenced by the cross-sectional SEM images in Fig. 2b and c. Not only the thin capping layer of MAPbI3, an improvement in the connection between MAPbI3 and the carbon counter electrode is also observed by the N2 blow drying method. Because of this, the extracted photo-generated holes by the NiO layer can be easily transported towards the carbon counter electrode (Fig. 4b). Conversely, the drop casting of MAPbI3 results in large perovskite crystals on the mesoscopic scaffold which hinders the charge transport (due to the longer charge transport path through MAPbI3), even though the hole extracting NiO layer is present in the device structure (Fig. 4c).

The JV characteristics and incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) spectrum of the best performing device are shown in Fig. 5. The photovoltaic parameters of forward and reverse scans are summarised in Table 2. The highest PCE of 10.8% with Jsc of 22.38 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.97 V and fill factor of 0.5 was observed for the champion cell which is the highest reported device efficiency for a c-TiO2/m-TiO2/ZrO2/NiO/MAPbI3/carbon printable solar cell with the low-temperature processing carbon counter electrode. The IPCE spectrum was employed to describe the external quantum efficiency of extracted electrons from incident photons at different wavelengths, which is directly related to the photocurrent density of the device. The onset of photocurrent at 800 nm is consistent with the band gap of the MAPbI3.39 The integrated IPCE spectrum with the AM 1.5 G solar photon flux yields a current density of 20.01 mA cm−2, which is in good agreement with the Jsc displayed in Table 2.

To confirm the reproducibility of the results, 25 separate devices (c-TiO2/m-TiO2/ZrO2/NiO/MAPbI3/carbon assisted with N2 blow drying for MAPbI3 formation) were fabricated and tested under the same conditions. Histograms of PCEs are shown in Fig. 6. Over 70% of the cells showed a PCE above 7% and more than 10% of the cells demonstrated a PCE above 10%.

Fig. 7a and b show the J–V curves measured at different incident light intensities and various voltage sweep rates, starting with a backward scan and directly continuing with a forward scan. In order to understand the charge generation and transport in the porous network of the device, we studied the dependence of Jsc and device efficiency on light intensity under different incident light intensities ranging from 0 to 100 mW cm−2 (Fig. 7c and d). The linear relationship of Jsc against the light intensity indicated that the charge collection efficiency is independent of light intensity, indicating sufficient electron and hole mobility, and no substantial space charge build-up in the integrated device with the scan rate (as the trends in the hysteresis remain almost the same even at higher scan rates).40

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was carried out to investigate the interfacial charge transfer processes in the solar cells. The measurements were conducted in the frequency range of 0.1 Hz to 1 MHz in the dark. Fig. 8a and 8b show the Nyquist plots recorded for TiO2/ZrO2/NiO/MAPbI3(N2 blow-dried)/carbon, TiO2/ZrO2/NiO/MAPbI3(drop cast)/carbon and TiO2/ZrO2/MAPbI3(N2 blow-dried)/carbon structured PSCs at a bias of 0.8 V. The RC response in the high-frequency region is assigned to the charge exchange process at the MAPbI3/carbon interface, whereas the low-frequency region represents the TiO2/MAPbI3 interface. The impedance data were fitted by two and three RC circuit models as shown in the inset of Fig. 8a and b respectively. For better fitting, all capacitor elements were replaced by constant phase elements. Rs is the series resistance, including the sheet resistance of the FTO and the contact resistance of the cell. Ra is the charge transfer resistance corresponding to the charge transport through the carbon/MAPbI3 interface and Ca (related to Ccpe_a) is related to the respective double-layer capacitance at the counter electrode interface. Rb is the charge transfer resistance of the charge recombination process between electrons in the TiO2 layer and holes in the MAPbI3. Cb (related to Ccpe_b) is associated with the diffusion capacitance and the depletion capacitance at the TiO2/MAPbI3 interface.
 Fig. 8  Nyquist plots (a) measured at 0.8 V bias in the dark (b) zoomed in the plot at higher frequency plot; derived EIS parameters against applied bias: (c) Rs, (d) Ra, (e) Ca and (f) Rb. 

Fig. 8c shows the Rs of the devices with the applied bias. The Rs is significantly higher for the device made without employing N2 blow drying compared to the other realising the benefit of N2 blow drying techniques for low device resistance. Fig. 8d and e show the Ra and Ca values as a function of applied bias respectively, indicating the charge transfer process through the carbon counter electrode. It is found that the solar cells with NiO and N2 blow-dried MAPbI3 exhibit relatively lower Ra, indicating a more efficient charge transfer at the carbon counter electrode due to the efficient charge extraction (by the hole conducting NiO layer) and transport (through a thin MAPbI3 capping layer formed by the N2 blow drying method) in the device. On the other hand, the recombination resistance of the device is exponentially reduced at higher voltages (Fig. 8f and g) due to the enhanced charge extraction to the external circuit.
Finally, the stability of our best-performing un-encapsulated c-TiO2/m-TiO2/ZrO2/NiO/MAPbI3/carbon device was tested in air in the dark and the detailed photovoltaic parameters are plotted as shown in Fig. 9. The photovoltaic performances of the PSC demonstrate high stability over 1000 h. After around 400 h, the initial PCE of 7.70% was shifted to the highest PCE of 10.83% with a Jsc of 22.38 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.97 V, and a FF of 0.5. As demonstrated in the figure, this enhancement in the PCE is mainly related to the improvement in the fill factor of the device which could be due to the better interaction of the perovskite with carbon by evaporating solvents upon ageing. Even after 1000 h of storing in air in the dark, the un-encapsulated PSC exhibited a PCE of 7.18%. This remarkable stability attributes to the thick carbon layer (∼60 μm), which can work as a self-encapsulation layer to protect the perovskite from being destroyed from moisture or oxygen.

Conclusions
In summary, we fabricated printable PSCs with a device structure of c-TiO2/m-TiO2/ZrO2/NiO/MAPbI3/carbon. In the device, NiO is used as the hole conducting layer (or electron blocking layer) and low-temperature processing (i.e. 75 °C) carbon as the counter electrode. Through detailed studies, we found that the capping layer thickness of MAPbI3 has a great effect on the photovoltaic performance of mesoscopic printable PSCs. Our best performing device showed an impressive PCE value of 10.83% with NiO as the hole transporting material and low-temperature processing carbon as the counter electrode. Impedance spectroscopy demonstrates good charge transport characteristics of the device with a thin capping layer of MAPbI3 achieved by the N2 blow drying method. Moreover, long-term stability investigations demonstrate that the un-encapsulated cells exhibit excellent stability over 1000 h. Overall, our promising results demonstrate that cost-effective and better performing printable PSCs can indeed be achieved in future commercialisation.
