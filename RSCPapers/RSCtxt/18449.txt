1. Introduction
Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells (OIH-PSCs) have received increasing attention owing to their rapid increase in power conversion efficiency (PCE).1–7 However, OIH-PSCs commonly suffer from poor stability, especially thermal stability, easily decomposing at high heat and humidity due to the presence of the organic parts (MA+, FA+, etc.).8–10 To address this issue, Cs+ replacement at A-site to form CsPbX3 (X = I, Br, Cl) materials has been developed.11–25 CsPbI3 with a cubic crystal structure (α-CsPbI3) has a band gap of 1.73 eV,14 a promising material for photovoltaic application, but α-CsPbI3 could only be stabilized at high temperature (over 310 °C), which would quickly transform into an unwanted yellow phase (δ-CsPbI3) after cooling down, especially in an air atmosphere.14,26
To stabilize α-CsPbI3, several strategies have been developed. For example, alloying with Br− has been widely exploited to stabilize α-CsPbI3.19,27 However, the composition change leads to an undesired increase in band gap. Then, α-CsPbI3 quantum dots with ultra-small grain size were found to be stable at room temperature in an air atmosphere for months.15 However, small quantum dots may generate lots of grain boundaries for inducing charge recombination, thus limiting device performance. Very recently, alloying B site has been demonstrated as an effective strategy to stabilize the perovskite lattice, and Bi3+ ions have been incorporated into α-CsPbI3 for enhancing phase stability at low temperature (100 °C).28 However, the Bi-doped α-CsPbI3 needed to be deposited in an Ar-atmosphere glovebox and the device stability was not high. Therefore, preparing high quality α-CsPbI3 with decent phase stability in an air atmosphere is still a big challenge, which greatly limits the performance and stability of α-CsPbI3 PSCs.
In addition to phase stability, the presence of organic hole transport materials (HTM) and metal electrode also affects the device stability of α-CsPbI3 PSCs.29–32 As most high-performance organic HTM are usually operationally unstable, and are commonly open and susceptible to migration of halide ions and metal ions from the metal electrode, the device stability is considerably limited. Therefore, removing or replacing organic HTM and/or the metal electrode should be considered for fabricating stable α-CsPbI3 PSCs.3,33–37 Our previous work indicated that a carbon electrode could directly and effectively extract holes from CsPbBr3 without using HTM and metal electrodes.38 The carbon-based perovskite solar cells (C-PSCs) based on CsPbBr3 worked well and, importantly, exhibited excellent stability. Therefore, using a carbon electrode as the hole extraction electrode should be considered to further improve the device stability of α-CsPbI3 PSCs.
Herein, we addressed the above issues by exploiting a series of measures. First, the non-stoichiometric effect was investigated and excess CsI was added to obtain the α-CsPbI3 phase in an air atmosphere. Then, the Sb-doping strategy was developed to further enhance the phase stability and improve the film morphology. Finally, a carbon electrode was directly applied as the hole extraction electrode without using HTM and metal electrodes. As a result, a black α-CsPbI3 film with high stability was obtained in an air atmosphere at low temperature (110 °C). Carbon-based CsPb0.96Sb0.04I3 perovskite solar cells without HTM (C-PSCs) achieved a promising PCE of 5.18%, a record value for α-CsPbI3-based PSCs without HTM. Significantly, the CsPb0.96Sb0.04I3 C-PSCs maintained 93% of the initial PCE after 37 days of storage in an air atmosphere.
2. Results and discussion
2.1 Non-stoichiometric effect
As well known, coordination chemistry is present in perovskite precursor solution, which largely affects the growth behavior, composition and quality of perovskite crystals. By modifying precursor ratios, coordination behavior has been utilized to control the crystal quality of MAPbI3.39,40 In present work, coordination behavior is for the first time exploited to control the growth behavior of CsPbI3 crystals, which was simply realized by adjusting the precursor ratios (CsI:PbI2). Interestingly, excess CsI was found to stabilize the α-CsPbI3 phase effectively at low temperature.

Fig. 1 schematically illustrates the fabrication processes of the α-CsPbI3 film in an air atmosphere at low temperature. Previously reported CsPbI3 precursor solutions usually contained equal molar of CsI and PbI2. After annealing at 110 °C, only a yellow δ-CsPbI3 phase was obtained. When it was heated up to 330 °C, a black α-CsPbI3 phase appeared but degraded quickly once cooled down in an air atmosphere. After non-stoichiometric investigation, excess CsI could stabilize α-CsPbI3 and a brownish-black film was obtained at 110 °C (Fig. 1b). Such a film was found to be composed of mixed Cs4PbI6 and α-CsPbI3 (Fig. 2b). Through IPA treatment, excess CsI could be washed away and Cs4PbI6 was converted to the α-CsPbI3 phase. Finally, a pure black α-CsPbI3 film was obtained. For comparison, the yellow δ-CsPbI3 film was not changed after IPA treatment. Sb3+ doping could further stabilize α-CsPbI3 and improve the film morphology which will be discussed in detail below.
 Fig. 1  Schematic illustration of the fabrication processes of α-CsPbI3 films. (a) Film processed with equal molar of CsI and PbI2, a yellow phase showed no change before and after IPA treatment. (b) Film processed with CsI:PbI2 = 1.5:1 solution and (c) film processed with excess CsI and 4% Sb doping, both presenting the black phase at 110 °C.

(a) Photograph, (b) comparison of XRD patterns and (e–h) SEM images of the films prepared from different CsI:PbI2 ratios. Magnification of (c) (110) and (d) (200) peaks shows peak splitting and shoulder, respectively, in the film processed with excess CsI. 

Fig. 2a shows the photographs of the films processed with different CsI:PbI2 ratios. The film color turns from yellow to black, indicating that increasing the CsI:PbI2 ratio may result in phase transition at 110 °C. XRD patterns in Fig. 2b indicate that at low CsI:PbI2 ratios (CsI:PbI2 = 0.5:1 or 1:1), only PbI2 and the yellow δ-CsPbI3 phase are present in the patterns. With the CsI:PbI2 ratio increasing (CsI:PbI2 = 1.5:1), α-CsPbI3 and Cs4PbI6 phases are detected, which cause the change in film color (Fig. 2a). As the CsI content is further increased (CsI:PbI2 = 2:1), the diffraction peaks of Cs4PbI6 become more intense with the film turning into yellow-brown (Fig. 2a). Therefore, excess CsI in the precursor solution helps to stabilize α-CsPbI3 in an air atmosphere at low temperature (110 °C). As a side note, the magnification of (110) and (200) peaks of the α-CsPbI3 phase shows the peak split and shoulder, respectively, which might be caused by crystal lattice strain in the film processed with excess CsI.14,16 Strain has previously been observed to induce crystal phase transitions, and serves to completely shift the phase diagram for a material.14,41,42 This strain could then be responsible for allowing the lower temperature phase transition and stability.
SEM images were recorded to observe the morphology of the films prepared from different CsI:PbI2 ratios (Fig. 2e–h). At low CsI:PbI2 ratios (CsI:PbI2 = 0.5:1 and 1:1), as shown in Fig. 2e and f, plenty of nanorod bundles are present on the mesoporous scaffold, together with an incomplete coverage. This phenomenon could be explained as below.39 When PbI2 is dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), PbI2 species first fall into (001)-aligned pieces due to facile breakdown of van der Waals interaction between (001) interlayers and are then coordinated with DMSO to break some chemical bonds inside the (001) intralayers for full dissolution.39 After introducing CsI into the PbI2-DMSO solution, CsI would selectively coordinate with PbI2 at (001) plane edge at first. However, limited by the trigonal crystallography of PbI2, colloidal PbI2 nanorods are stacked together in the form of nanorod bundles through the atom sharing of halogen between nanorods, as shown in Fig. 2e (small bundles) and Fig. 2f (large bundles). With the CsI:PbI2 ratio increasing, the 1D morphology disappears and a uniform and continuous film is obtained (Fig. 2g). The crystals in the film obtained at the CsI:PbI2 ratio of 1.5:1 have an average grain size of ∼300 nm (Fig. S1†), which is reduced to ∼150 nm at the CsI:PbI2 ratio of 2:1. At higher CsI contents, a lower number of atoms are shared among [PbX6] octahedra, which would separate coordination units and induce a smaller colloidal framework. Therefore, excess CsI has assisted the film formation and improved the film quality. Moreover, smaller grains induced by excess CsI may also contribute to the stability of α-CsPbI3.15
Though high CsI:PbI2 ratios could obtain stable α-CsPbI3, Cs4PbI6 is still present in the film, which would negatively affect the PV performance of α-CsPbI3. Therefore, it is necessary to convert Cs4PbI6 to α-CsPbI3, by supplementing PbI2 or extracting CsI. Here, a simple chemical approach was proposed to dissolve CsI in a special solvent. Considering the strong polarity of CsI, the polarity of the selected solvent should be moderate in order to control the dissolution rate based on the theory of similarity and intermiscibility. Since CsI dissolves slowly into IPA at room temperature without the ultrasonic process, the dissolution of CsI could be easily controlled. Therefore, IPA was chosen as the solvent to extract CsI to promote the conversion of Cs4PbI6 to α-CsPbI3. XRD patterns in Fig. 3b indicate that the corresponding Cs4PbI6 peaks disappear and a pure CsPbI3 phase is obtained after IPA treatment for 4 min at 70 °C. The magnification of (110) and (200) peaks demonstrates the presence of lattice strain in the α-CsPbI3 crystal after IPA treatment (Fig. S2†). In addition to the change in phase composition, the surface morphology is largely modified after IPA treatment. As shown in Fig. 3c, the smooth and uniform surface becomes rough and lots of cubic-shape grains form after IPA treatment, further indicating the phase transition. The grain size becomes slightly larger after IPA treatment, with an average size of ∼350 nm (Fig. S3†). Meanwhile, the film color turns darker as exhibited in Fig. 3c.

(b) Comparison of XRD patterns and (c) SEM images and photographs of the films before and after IPA treatment. (d) Comparison of high-resolution XPS spectra of the CsPbI3 films (CsI:PbI2 = 1.5:1) before and after IPA treatment. 
XPS spectra of the CsPbI3 film processed with and without IPA treatment were further taken to survey the conversion processes. The characteristic peaks of Cs 3d, Pb 4f, and I 3d are exhibited in Fig. 3d. Both the characteristic peaks of Cs 3d and I 3d shift to lower energy after IPA treatment. This could be ascribed to lower electronegativity of Cs than that of Pb, which would result in the stronger Cs–I bonds in Cs4PbI6 and consequently leading to the reduction in the binding energies of Cs and I after CsI extraction. Moreover, the amount of Cs and I, corresponding to the peak intensity, decreases after IPA treatment. As indicated in Table S1,† the atom ratio of Cs:Pb:I in the IPA-treated α-CsPbI3 films is 2:1:4, while the ratio for the pristine sample is 3:1:5, which further confirms the CsI extraction. It is worth noting that the characteristic peaks of Pb 4f show almost no shift after IPA treatment, indicating that the chemical environment of the Pb atom is basically the same before and after IPA treatment. This could be easily understood from the crystal structures (Fig. 2a). In the Cs–Pb–I series lattice, one Pb atom is strongly bonded with six I atoms due to the high electronegativity of I, both in Cs4PbI6 and α-CsPbI3 crystal lattices, which leads to the almost unchanged binding energy of Pb 4f after IPA treatment.
2.2 Sb doping in α-CsPbI3
Though excess CsI well promotes the crystallization of α-CsPbI3 at a lower temperature in an air atmosphere, the phase stability is still needed to be further improved. In previously reported studies, heterovalent substitutions of Pb in perovskites were proved to not only promote electron transport thus enhancing the cell performance but also induce lattice distortion, which could help to improve the phase stability.24,28,43 Here, we further exploited the heterovalent substitution to improve the phase stability of α-CsPbI3 and Sb atoms were chosen because of their success in substituting Pb in CH3NH3PbI3.43 The preparation processes of CsPb1−xSbxI3 (0 < x < 1) films were the same as those of pristine CsPbI3. Fig. 4a illustrates the XRD patterns of the α-CsPbI3 film with different Sb3+ doping contents. After doping 2% Sb into α-CsPbI3, the corresponding perovskite diffraction peaks shift to lower 2θ, indicating the enlargement in the crystal lattice. Since the size of Sb atoms is smaller than that of Pb, Sb atoms might have been inserted into the α-CsPbI3 crystal lattice rather than substitution of Pb atoms. Such insertion behavior may induce crystal lattice distortion in α-CsPbI3, which could contribute to enhancing the phase stability of α-CsPbI3.14,28 With the Sb doping content increasing, the (100) peak shifts to lower 2θ, and the (100) plane distance increases from 3.09 Å to 3.16 Å as the Sb doping content increases from 0 to 10% (Table S2†).
 Fig. 4  Effect of Sb-doping on α-CsPbI3. (a) XRD patterns of the α-CsPbI3 film with different Sb3+ doping contents. (b) Magnification of the (110) peak to highlight the peak shift. (c) Comparison of high-resolution XPS spectra of CsPbI3 and CsPb0.96Sb0.04I3 films. (d) SEM images of the α-CsPbI3 films with different Sb3+ doping contents. 
XPS was further performed to investigate the influence of Sb doping (Fig. 4c). The peaks at around 530 eV and 540 eV correspond to Sb 3d5/2 and Sb 3d3/2 components, respectively, verifying the existence of Sb. Since Sb possesses lower electronegativity compared to Pb, the Sb–I bond is stronger than the Pb–I bond. With a small amount of SbI3 doping, extra I atoms would be present in the CsPb1−xSbxI3 crystal lattice, which would reduce the electron cloud density of the Pb atom. Therefore, the binding energy of Pb 4f is increased in CsPb1−xSbxI3 compared with that in pristine α-CsPbI3.
The pristine α-CsPbI3 with IPA treatment shows lots of cubic crystals sparsely distributing on the surface. After 2% Sb doping into α-CsPbI3, grain boundary blurs and grains tend to share with each other, which forms a smoother surface compared with the pristine α-CsPbI3 film, as shown in Fig. 4d. Moreover, the grain size decreases from ∼350 nm to ∼170 nm with 2% Sb3+ doping (Fig. S3†), which may contribute to the excellent stability of the CsPb1−xSbxI3 film as the grain size also plays an important role in crystal lattice stability. Further increasing the Sb content to 4%, the grain size slightly increases to around 280 nm (Fig. S3†). Once the doping amount is increased up to 10%, larger grains are obtained and the grain boundary turns fuzzier. The film surface fails to completely cover on the mesoporous scaffold, which would severely reduce the cell performance. Therefore, a moderate amount of Sb doping could improve the morphology of the α-CsPbI3 film.
Optical properties of the CsPbI3 film before and after Sb-doping were studied by light absorption spectra and photoluminescence spectra. As indicated in Fig. 5a, no obvious difference is observed between the absorption spectra of CsPbI3 and CsPb0.96Sb0.04I3 films, whose absorption onsets are similar at ∼720 nm. However, detectable change is observed in PL spectra. The spectrum of the pure CsPbI3 with IPA treatment presents a band-edge emission peak centering at around 706 nm, while the emission peak shifts to a lower wavelength at around 694 nm for the CsPb0.96Sb0.04I3 film. Therefore, the PL result suggests a slight broadening in the band gap after Sb doping. As clearly noted, the effect of IPA treatment on the position of emission peaks (or band gap) is small.

2.3 α-CsPbI3 C-PSCs
To evaluate the photovoltaic performance, the carbon electrode was deposited on the α-CsPbI3 films to construct C-PSCs, as illustrated in Fig. 6a. Such a device is composed of FTO/c-TiO2/m-TiO2/m-Al2O3/CsPbI3/carbon. The cross-sectional SEM image (Fig. 6b) shows that the thicknesses of the m-TiO2 scaffold, m-Al2O3 scaffold and CsPbI3 film are 340 nm, 40 nm and 680 nm, respectively. Though the carbon electrode is porous, it still closely contacts with the CsPbI3 film, which would favor hole extraction at the interface. Current density–voltage (J–V) curves with different scanning directions were recorded for performance comparison between the α-CsPbI3 and CsPb0.96Sb0.04I3 C-PSCs. As shown in Fig. 6c and Table 1, α-CsPbI3 C-PSCs show an open-circuit potential (Voc) of 0.65 V, a short-circuit current (Jsc) of 13.43 mA cm−2, a fill factor (FF) of 38% and a PCE of 3.32% for the forward scan, while the reverse scan exhibits a higher performance with a Voc of 0.71 V, a Jsc of 13.46 mA cm−2, a FF of 46% and a PCE of 4.45%. With 4% Sb3+ doping, the performance is considerably improved, with a Voc of 0.73 V, a Jsc of 14.64 mA cm−2, a FF of 48% and a PCE of 5.18% for the forward scan, and a Voc of 0.73 V, a Jsc of 14.65 mA cm−2, a FF of 50% and a PCE of 5.31% for the reverse scan. The PCE obtained by CsPb0.96Sb0.04I3 C-PSCs is also higher than other reported CsPbI3 C-PSCs.25 As a side note, the Voc achieved here by the CsPbI3 C-PSCs is relatively lower compared with those reported for HTM-based α-CsPbI3 PSCs, which may be attributed to the following reasons. Firstly, the work function level of the carbon electrode is obviously higher than the valence band level of organic HTM, which lowers the energy level match between α-CsPbI3 and the carbon electrode.44 Besides, the surface of the present CsPbI3 film is not very even, which would lead to a poor contact with the carbon electrode, and hence would result in recombination loss at the interface and lower Voc. Therefore, it is expected that enhancing energy level match at the interface and improving the CsPbI3 film morphology would be effective to increase the Voc.

CsPbI3 C-PSCs show a hysteresis index (HI) of 25.4% that is calculated according to HI = |(PCE(reverse)-PCE(forward))|/PCE(reverse),45 while CsPb0.96Sb0.04I3 C-PSCs exhibit a HI of 2.4%. Therefore, compared with CsPbI3 C-PSCs, hysteresis is significantly suppressed in CsPb0.96Sb0.04I3 C-PSCs. The IPCE spectra are further taken for comparison (Fig. 6d). Compared with CsPbI3 C-PSCs, CsPb0.96Sb0.04I3 C-PSCs show higher IPCE values in the whole wavelength, generating the integrated Jsc of 14.5 mA cm−2vs. 13.5 mA cm−2, which are consistent with those obtained from J–V curves. Since no obvious difference in light absorption is observed for CsPbI3 and CsPb0.96Sb0.04I3, CsPb0.96Sb0.04I3 C-PSCs should own higher carrier collection efficiency than CsPbI3 C-PSCs.
To get insight into the large performance difference between α-CsPbI3 and CsPb0.96Sb0.04I3 C-PSCs, the electron transport and recombination behavior in the α-CsPbI3 and CsPb0.96Sb0.04I3 C-PSCs were further investigated by intensity modulated photocurrent/photovoltage spectroscopy (IMPS/IMVS). Fig. 6e–g show the function relationship between light intensity (I0) and electron diffusion coefficients (Dn), electron lifetime (τn) and diffusion length (Ln). Firstly, the diffusion coefficients (Dn) were calculated from complex plane plots according to the equation: τt = 1/(2πfmin(IMPS)) and Dn = d2/2.35τt, where τt, fmin(IMPS) and d represent the transition time, the frequency at minimum point of the IMPS complex plane plot and the film thickness, respectively.46–48 As I0 increases, Dn just declines slightly. Electron lifetime (τn) was calculated according to equation: τn = 1/(2πfmin(IMVS)), where fmin(IMVS) represents the frequency at minimum point of the IMVS complex plane plot.46–48τn for both α-CsPbI3 and CsPb0.96Sb0.04I3 C-PSCs decreases with I0. While τn of CsPb0.96Sb0.04I3 C-PSCs is higher than that of CsPbI3 C-PSCs, indicating the faster electron transport in CsPb0.96Sb0.04I3 films. The Ln, calculated according to the equation of Ln = (Dnτn)1/2, of CsPb0.96Sb0.04I3 C-PSCs is nearly two times longer than that of CsPbI3 C-PSCs, which is in the range of 1–2 μm. Since the film thickness of CsPb0.96Sb0.04I3 is around 1 μm, most of the carriers are efficiently collected in CsPb0.96Sb0.04I3 C-PSCs.
Since stability is a core issue for PSCs, the stability of the CsPbI3 C-PSCs in the air atmosphere (<20% RH, 25 °C) without encapsulation was also investigated. As shown in Fig. 7, the PCE of the CsPbI3 device increases initially but drops to 73% of the initial value within 10 days. Such a stability merit is not very high but is still better than that reported for Bi-doping α-CsPbI3.28 Therefore, excess CsI is promising to prepare stable pure α-CsPbI3 for PV application. More importantly, CsPb0.96Sb0.04I3 C-PSCs show significantly improved stability in an air atmosphere. The PCE retains 93% of its initial value after 37 days. To date, CsPbI3 PSCs are commonly fabricated in an Ar or N2 atmosphere with a high-cost metal electrode, which may obtain higher PCE but device stability is usually lower, especially in an air atmosphere.15,17,28 The present C-PSCs with such high stability highlight the promise of our air-processed α-CsPbI3 and CsPb0.96Sb0.04I3. Besides, the carbon electrode with high water resistance, air isolation and thermal stability should also be an important reason for enhanced device stability.3,33,34,49,50

3. Conclusion
We have investigated the effect of non-stoichiometry and Sb-doping on the properties of the α-CsPbI3 film. The CsI:PbI2 ratios show significant influence on both the phase composition and morphology of the CsPbI3 film, and the α-CsPbI3 phase could be obtained at 110 °C in an air atmosphere with excess CsI accompanied with the generation of Cs4PbI6. Through IPA washing, Cs4PbI6 was converted to α-CsPbI3 and the C-PSCs based on such an α-CsPbI3 film showed a PCE of 3.32% that retained 73% after 10 days of storage in an air atmosphere. After introducing a small amount of Sb3+ ions into the α-CsPbI3 film, phase stability was enhanced and the film morphology was also improved. The CsPb0.96Sb0.04I3 C-PSCs achieved a promising PCE of 5.18%, a record value for α-CsPbI3-based PSCs without HTM. Significantly, the CsPb0.96Sb0.04I3 C-PSCs retained 93% of the initial PCE after 37 days of storage in an air atmosphere.
4. Experimental
4.1 Pure CsPbI3 film fabrication
The precursor solutions were composed of different molar ratios (1:1, 1.5:1, 2:1, 3:1) of cesium iodide (99.999%, sigma) and lead iodide (99.9%, Dr Mao) dissolved in DMSO. Subsequently, the precursor films were prepared by spin-coating on the mesoporous scaffold at a speed of 2000 rpm for 30 s, and annealed at 110 °C for 10 min in the air. Then, they were dipped in IPA, and heated at 70 °C for 4 min. Finally, the obtained CsPbI3 films were annealed in an air atmosphere at 100 °C for 5 min. Note that all the procedures were performed under fully open-air conditions with humidity below 30% at room temperature.
4.2 Sb3+ doping CsPbI3 film fabrication
SbI3 (99.999%, purchased from the Yingkou You Xuan Trade Co., Ltd) was added into the precursor solution, controlling the total molar concentration of Sb3+ and Pb2+ at 1.2 M in different stoichiometric ratio precursor solutions. Other steps were the same as the above deposition processes of pure CsPbI3.
4.3 PSC fabrication
Firstly, the TiO2 blocking layer was deposited on cleaned FTO glass by spin-coating 0.15 M titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) in 1-butanol solution at 2000 rpm for 20 s and later heated at 125 °C for 5 min. Then, the TiO2 porous scaffold was spin-coated at 5000 rpm for 30 s using a commercial TiO2 paste (Dyesol 30 NRD, Dyesol) that was diluted by ethanol with a weight ratio of 1:2.5, and heated at 100 °C for 5 min. Afterwards, the temperature was gradually heated up to 550 °C and maintained for 2 h. Later, the TiO2 scaffold was cooled to room temperature waiting for the deposition of mesoporous Al2O3 (purchased from Qingdao GRENE Co., Ltd, diluting 10 times with ethanol for use), spin-coated at 2000 rpm for 20 s. Then, the precursor solution was spin coated at 2000 rpm for 20 s, followed by immersing the film in IPA to obtain black CsPbI3 at 100 °C. Finally, the carbon extraction layer was simply deposited by printing the carbon paint (purchased from Guangzhou Seaside Technology Co., Ltd) on the perovskite layer at room temperature followed by heating at 100 °C for 30 min.
4.4 Film characterization
Surface morphologies were observed using a JSM-7500F field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM). X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded using a Rigaku D/MAX-2500 X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation. Absorption spectra were recorded with a UV-3000 ultraviolet and visible (UV-vis) spectrophotometer. PL spectra were recorded using a Jobin Yvon (Laboratory RAM HR800) confocal micro-Raman spectrometer.
4.5 C-PSCs characterization
The J–V curves were recorded on a Zahner photoelectrochemical workstation under the illumination of a solar simulator (Newport SOL3A 94023A, 100 mW cm−2, AM 1.5), intensity standardized by the standard Si cell (Newport). The active cell area was all fixed at 6.25 mm2. The intensity modulated photocurrent/photovoltage spectroscopy (IMPS/IMVS) was also performed on the Zahner photoelectrochemical workstation and the wavelength of the illumination light was 458 nm. IPCE spectra were recorded using an IPCE kit (E0201, Institute of Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences) in the DC mode. The stability of the α-CsPbI3 and CsPb0.96Sb0.04I3 C-PSCs was investigated in an air atmosphere (<20% RH, 25 °C) without encapsulation.
