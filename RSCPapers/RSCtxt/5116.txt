    , Accepted 3rd April 2019First published on 3rd April 2019AbstractThe simultaneous realization of both high-efficiency and long-term durability of transparent, colorful dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) is of paramount importance to gradually supersede the aesthetically repulsive silicon solar cells for future building integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) applications. In this paper we synthesize two donor–acceptor organic dyes C296 and C298 characteristic of a polycyclic heteroaromatic unit 6,11-dihydrothieno[3′,2′:8,9]chryseno[10,11,12,1-bcdefg]carbazole (TCC) as the primary electron-releasing unit, in conjunction with the 4-(benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazol-4-yl)benzoic acid (BTBA) and 4-(benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazol-4-ylethynyl)benzoic acid (BTEBA) electron acceptors. Both dyes possess suitable energy gaps, reasonably long excited state lifetimes, and high charge separation yields, allowing for the fabrication of transparent DSSCs with over 10% power conversion efficiencies under the illumination of 100 mW cm−2, AM1.5G sunlight for the first time. The see-through DSSCs based on the TCC dye with BTEBA as the electron acceptor display good efficiency retention after full sunlight soaking at 60 °C for 1000 h.
Introduction
The dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) technology is promising for the low-cost conversion of solar or artificial light to clean electric power, with properties of tunable colors and various degrees of transparency.1–3 To further boost the power conversion efficiency (PCE) and long-term durability for an expanded range of applications, it is essential to finely adjust dye structures, electrolyte recipes, and interface microstructures,4–6 which are intrinsically associated with the key processes of solar cells, including light absorption, carrier photogeneration, charge collection, and the Fermi-level splitting at the photoelectrochemical function-zone.7,8 In the development process of this type of device, numerous ruthenium polypyridyl9–12 and zinc porphyrin13–16 complexes have been prepared and functioned as powerful sensitizers in DSSCs, achieving impressive PCEs up to 13%. Nonetheless ruthenium dyes encounter the limitation of scarce resources17 for large scale application and low absorption coefficients,18 and porphyrin dyes are hard to use for making thermostable DSSCs.19
Meanwhile, intense explorations have been focused on metal-free donor–acceptor (D–A) organic dyes,20 leading to the recent breakthrough of a stable DSSC at 85 °C showing a 10% PCE.21 However, it has been widely noted that the iodide/triiodide redox electrolyte can engender severe corrosion of most metal electrodes and low open-circuit photovoltage of DSSCs due to considerably large thermodynamic losses in the process of hole injection. Another remarkable achievement of D–A organic dyes is the PCE record of DSSCs, over 14% at the moment.22 Note that the employment of a cobalt-based redox electrolyte, and multi-scale engineering of the light absorbing molecular layer to avert direct contact between titania and the electrolyte also play significant roles in making this high-efficiency device. Indubitably, a DSSC with a cobalt electrolyte must be durable for practical applications.23–30 The main dilemma of a large hydrodynamic radius, cobalt redox couple for DSSCs is the inevitable use of a high-fluidity molecule solvent for electrolyte formulation, in order to satisfy mass transport. Regrettably, a lot of organic dye molecules are prone to being desorbed by solvent molecules from the surface of titania particularly at an elevated temperature. Therefore the judicious design of dye molecules that can stick strongly to titania is very pertinent for stable DSSCs with a cobalt redox couple.
In comparison to silicon solar cells, transparent, colorful dye-sensitized solar cells are becoming a powerful candidate for see-through building integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) applications, which provide electricity and day-light simultaneously.31–34 There is always a trade-off between light absorption to generate more charges and light transmittance to acquire high transparency. The transparency of DSSCs is dependent on the particle size and thickness of titania, the nature and loading amount of dye molecules, and the material and thickness of current collectors. In this regard, considerable research activities have been carried out to enhance the performance of see-through DSSCs, such as the use of photonic crystals to replace the light-scattering layer,35–37 molecular engineering of dyes,38,39 and the fabrication of translucent counter electrodes.40–42 The light-scattering layer with an ability to enlarge the residence time of photons by diffusing light in the absorbing layer of all high-efficiency DSSCs, remarkably diminishes the device transparency. Encouragingly, the highest PCE of transparent DSSCs has already reached 8.2%.37
In this paper, we report two D–A organic dyes C296 and C298 (Fig. 1) which respectively utilize 4-(benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazol-4-yl)benzoic acid (BTBA) and 4-(benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazol-4-ylethynyl)benzoic acid (BTEBA) as electron acceptors, in combination with a polycylic heteroaromatic (PHA) unit (6,11-dihydrothieno[3′,2′:8,9]chryseno[10,11,12,1-bcdefg]carbazole, TCC) as the major electron-donating segment. The influence of electron acceptors on excited state dynamics of these two PHA dyes either dissolved in solutions or grafted on the surface of oxide mesoporous films will be surveyed by measuring the femtosecond fluorescence traces in the near infrared region with a gate pulse at 1200 nm. Furthermore, we will investigate the durability under full sunlight soaking at 60 °C of C296 and C298 based DSSCs with a cobalt redox electrolyte by systematic electrical and photophysical measurements.

Here 4-(benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazol-4-yl)benzoic acid (BTBA, blue) and 4-(benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazol-4-ylethynyl)benzoic acid (BTEBA, red) are used as the electron acceptors for C296 and C298, respectively. 
Results and discussion
To prove the influence of electron acceptors (BTBA vs. BTEBA) on the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of D–A dyes, we used a glassy carbon electrode to record cyclic voltammograms (Fig. 2a) of C296 and C298 dissolved in tetrahydrofuran (THF) under an atmosphere of nitrogen. During the voltammetric measurements decamethylferrocene (DMFc) owing to a much more negative redox potential than those of the high-HOMO organic DSSC dyes was added to the electrolytic cell as the internal reference, and the potentials were finally calibrated with respect to the standard redox couple ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+). Note that Fc has a 0.489 V higher potential than DMFc. From the curves shown in Fig. 2a, the electrochemical HOMO and LUMO energy levels (EcvH and EcvL, Table S1†) of C296 and C298 were calculated using the equation: E = −4.88 − eEonset, where Eonset represents the oxidation and reduction potentials of a dye molecule in the ground (S0) state. As tabulated in Table S1,† BTEBA with a stronger electron-accepting characteristic stabilizes the LUMO energy level (EcvL) of C298 by 0.22 eV (−3.44 eV for C298 vs. −3.22 eV for C296). In the meantime, the HOMO energy levels (EcvH) of both dyes are very comparable (−4.97 eV for C296 and −4.98 eV for C298) albeit the stronger stabilization effect of BTEBA vs. BTBA on the HOMO can also be identified. As a result, C298 is detected to possess a reduced LUMO/HOMO energy gap (ΔEcvL/H, 1.75 eV for C296 and 1.54 eV for C298). As illustrated in Table S1,† density functional theory (DFT) calculations at the B3LYP/6-311(d,p) level of theory can nicely replicate the experimental tendencies of HOMOs, LUMOs, and LUMO/HOMO energy gaps.

The steady-state UV-Vis absorption and fluorescence spectra of dyes (50 μM) in both toluene (PhMe) and THF are shown in Fig. 2b, and the detailed photophysical parameters are listed in Table 1. As Fig. 2b presents, vibronic features are clearly discerned for the UV-Vis absorption spectra of both C296 and C298, but fully vanish in the fluorescence spectra. Absorption maxima (Table 1) of both dyes in THF are blue-shifted in contrast to those in PhMe, which could be rationalized by the stronger stabilization of HOMOs than LUMOs by a polar solvent, and thus the enlarged LUMO/HOMO gaps (Fig. S1†). Moreover, the experimental absorption maximum (λMEASABS,MAX) of C298 in PhMe are red-shifted by 20 nm in comparison with that of C296, and the red-shift in THF is 24 nm. Also, the replacement of the BTBA electron acceptor in C296 with more conjugated BTEBA for C298 also results in an enlarged maximum molar absorption coefficient (εMEASMAX), i.e. 3.95 × 104 M−1 cm−1 for C298 in PhMe compared to the 3.51 × 104 M−1 cm−1 for C296, in accordance with the tendency in THF. The trend of absorption maxima (λTD-MPWIKABS,MAX, Table 1) simulated by the time-dependent DFT (TDDFT) method at the TD-MPW1K/6-311G(d,p) level of theory is well consistent with the experimental observation. By looking carefully at the TDDFT results, one could easily conclude that the low-energy absorption bands of both dyes stem mainly from the vertical electronic transitions from the HOMOs to LUMOs. The intramolecular charge-transfer transition feature could be vividly depicted by the isodensity surface of frontier molecular orbitals in Fig. S2 and S3.† A less overlap between the HOMO and LUMO is observed for either C296 or C298, compared to the electron donor (compound 3) and electron acceptor (BTBA or BTEBA) in Fig. S1.†

a Experimental absorption maxima (λMEASABS,MAX), maximum molar absorption coefficients (εMEASMAX), fluorescence maxima (λMEASFL,MAX), fluorescence quantum yields (ϕFL), and Stokes shifts (ΔMEAS) were inferred from UV-Vis absorption and fluorescence spectra of PhMe and THF solutions presented in Fig. 2b. Theoretical absorption maxima (λTD-MPWIKABS,MAX), fluorescence maxima (λTD-MPWIKFL,MAX), and Stokes shifts (ΔTD-MPWIK) were calculated at the TD-MPW1K/6-311G(d,p) level of theory for dye molecules in PhMe and THF. The average time constants () were obtained from femtosecond fluorescence kinetic traces of the Seq1 states.

Fluorescence spectra of both dyes in THF are red-shifted when the solvent is changed from PhMe to THF because the intramolecular charge-transfer excited state can be more stabilized by a higher polarity solvent. In addition, dye C296 is more sensitive to the alteration of solvent polarity than C298 owing to the planarity difference of their electron acceptors. The relative tendencies of fluorescence maxima (λTD-MPWIKFL,MAX) and Stokes shifts (ΔTD-MPWIK) simulated by TDDFT are in line with those of the experimental results. Furthermore, the fluorescence quantum yields (ϕFL, Table 1) of dye solutions were determined by using an integral sphere.43 The ϕFL value of either dye in high-polarity THF is dramatically lower than that in low-polarity PhMe, which could be explained by the enhanced nonradiative excited-state deactivation in terms of the energy-gap law.
We then measured the femtosecond fluorescence kinetics,44–48 with an excitation pulse at a wavelength of 530 nm and a gate pulse at 1200 nm. This optical configuration allows us to record the fluorescence kinetic traces in an uninterrupted wavelength range in the visible and infrared region (Fig. S6–S9†), and fully probe the excited state evolution of low-energy-gap DSSC dyes. The kinetic traces at three different wavelengths of 640 nm, 720 nm, and 860 nm for C298 in PhMe are very much divergent as demonstrated in Fig. 2c. The fluorescence kinetic traces at all probed wavelengths could be globally fitted with a set of time constants. For analytical details see the Experimental section. The fitting parameters are shown in Tables S2–S5.† Along with the red-shift of fluorescence wavelengths, the average time constant () gradually increases by 1–3 orders of magnitude (Fig. 2d) for both dyes either in PhMe or THF, reaching a constant value which is considered as the lifetime of the equilibrium first excited singlet state (Seq1). The Seq1 lifetimes of both dyes in PhMe are not very different, being 771 ps for C296 and 744 ps for C298. In more polar THF, their Seq1 lifetimes (545 ps for C296 and 460 ps for C298) are shortened probably due to the accelerated nonradiative decay. We remark that the polar environment formed by the electrolyte and oxide presents a big challenge for the energetic and kinetic control of D–A organic dyes in the excited state.
According to the Franck–Condon principle, the molecular conformation of a vertically excited state (Svert) is considered the same as its S0 state, because the atom coordinate change occurs in a time-domain much longer than that of <1 fs for electronic excitation.49 The Svert state gradually relaxes to the equilibrium first excited state (Seq1) via barrierless vibrational motions within 100 fs,50 solvation processes within a few picoseconds,51,52 and stepwise torsional relaxations within a longer time delay.53–55 By comparing the fitting parameters in Tables S2–S5,† it can be found that along with the increase of solvent polarity for either dye, the amplitudes of τ1 and τ2 remarkably increase at a given long fluorescence wavelength, suggesting that solvation relaxations occur in the picosecond time domain. The appearance of structural relaxations including torsional relaxation is also conceivable due to the more planar conjugated backbone of the Seq1 state in contrast to that of the S0 state (Fig. S4 and S5†).56 This can be supported by the slow rise of kinetic traces within tens of picoseconds at the long fluorescence wavelengths (Fig. S6–S9†), and the negative amplitudes of τ3 (Tables S2–S5†). An alteration between single and double bonds for the three selected bonds on the benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (BT) units is also noted for the Seq1 and S0 states as depicted in Fig. S4 and S5.†57
Time-resolved fluorescence traces (Fig. S10–S13†) of dye molecules grafted on the surface of alumina and titania films in contact with a Co-bpy based redox electrolyte for cell fabrication were further recorded to evaluate the yields (ϕei) and kinetics (ei) of electron injection from photoexcited dye molecules to semiconducting titania nanocrystals. Interestingly, fluorescence decay traces at 680 nm, 760 nm, and 860 nm for the C298-grafted titania film are also remarkably disparate (Fig. 3a). The average time constants () of the fluorescence decays of C296 and C298 on alumina or titania also increase by 1–2 orders of magnitude accompanied by the red-shift of the fluorescence wavelength, and attain invariable values at long fluorescence wavelengths. It is very likely that vibrational relaxation, solvent relaxation, and torsional relaxation also occur for dye molecules self-organized on the oxide surface. The Seq1 lifetimes of dye molecules on titania are 17 ps for C296 and 38 ps for C298, which are however much shorter than those (491 ps for C296 and 384 ps for C298) on alumina (Fig. 3b). The reduction of fluorescence lifetimes is ascribed to electron injection from the excited-state dye molecules to titania. In addition, the Seq1 lifetimes of C296 and C298 grafted on alumina are slightly shorter than those in THF, which could be argued from the viewpoints of dye aggregation on alumina and a high dielectric environment of alumina and acetonitrile. The yield and time constant of electron injection can be derived from the time constants of fluorescence kinetic decays of dye molecules on alumina and titania by the use of eqn (3) and (4) in the Experimental section. At short fluorescence wavelengths, either dye at the hot excited states displays low ϕei values, because the hot excited states can transform into the relaxed excited states including the Seq1 state with lower energies. The relaxed excited states, which however have longer fluorescence lifetimes, present higher ϕei values as shown in Fig. 3c. Such fast electron injection is also supported by chemical adsorption of dyes C296 and C298 on the surface of titania film, as demonstrated in ATR-FTIR spectra (Fig. S14†).

The solid lines are also displayed as a guide to the eye. 
Along with the decrease in the electron free energy of excited states from 1.8 eV to 1.3 eV, the ei values increase for over one order of magnitude as shown in Fig. 3d, which can be accounted for by the driving force variation. The relaxations of the hot excited state compete with the process of electron injection, which should be delicately controlled in the future development of materials and device structures. The ei of C298 at the Seq1 state is 41.6 ps, which is much larger than that of 17.9 ps for C296, due to a smaller driving force for C298, which is intrinsically ascribed to the lower LUMO energy level of its Seq1 state (−2.65 eV for C296 and −2.76 eV for C298 calculated at the TD-MPW1K/6-311G(d,p) level of theory).
To shed light on the interfacial charge-transfer reactions between the photogenerated holes on the dye molecules and electrons in titania or cobalt(II) ions in the electrolyte, we employed a pump-probe absorption spectrometer58–60 to monitor the transient absorption traces at 1300 nm. The transient signal at this wavelength is mainly assigned to the oxidized organic dye molecules. The fitting lines on experimental traces (Fig. 4) are used for the precise assessment of half-reaction times. For the dye-grafted titania films in contact with an inert electrolyte, the half-lifetimes (tinert1/2) of the back-electron transfer reaction from titania to the photo-generated holes on dye molecules are 0.79 ms for C296 and 0.62 ms for C298. When the dyed titania films were immersed in a Co-bpy electrolyte, significantly faster kinetic decays were recorded in the microsecond time domain, owing to the injection of holes to the electrolyte. The corresponding half-lifetimes (tCo-bpy1/2) are 7.0 μs for C296 and 13 μs for C298. Due to similar HOMO energy levels (EcvH: −4.97 eV for C296 and −4.98 eV for C298), the larger tCo-bpy1/2 value for C298 could be mainly caused by the weaker electronic coupling of dye molecules with the cobalt electrolyte. In general, the kinetic distinction of the two competitive charge transfer reactions is almost 2 orders of magnitude for both dyes, resulting in close-to-unity hole injection yields (ϕhi: 99% for C296 and 98% for C298).
 Fig. 4  Transient absorption traces at 1300 nm of dye-grafted titania films: (a and c) C296; (b and d) C298. Note that the films were in contact with (a and b) an inert electrolyte of 0.1 M 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP) and 0.1 M lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) in acetonitrile, and (c and d) a Co-bpy electrolyte. Pulse fluence: 70 μJ cm−2. The excitation wavelengths were selected at a 0.5 optical density of dye-grafted titania films to yield a similar distribution profile of vertically excited states in the testing samples. Excitation wavelength: 610 nm for C296; 635 nm for C298. The solid gray lines are the multi-exponential fitting lines. 
A 4 μm-thick, dye-grafted mesoporous titania film on FTO (fluorine doped tin oxide) glass was combined with a Co-bpy based redox electrolyte and platinized FTO glass to fabricate DSSCs. The details of the electrolyte recipe and cell fabrication can be found in the Experimental section. The colors of transparent cells are crimson for C296 and coffee for C298. With an additional white light bias, the external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of DSSCs were measured under short-circuit conditions with incident monochromatic light at a wavelength interval of 10 nm. As shown in Fig. 5a, higher EQE values in the wavelength range from 640 nm to 800 nm are observed for the C298 cell, although its EQEs in the wavelength range from 400 nm to 640 nm are lower than those of the C296 cell. In the near-infrared region of normalized EQE spectra (Fig. S16†), improved values could be easily detected, well consistent with a narrower optical energy gap of C298. This scenario can also be proved by taking a look at the light-harvesting efficiencies (LHEs) of dyed titania films (Fig. 5b). In addition, the higher EQE maximum of C296 is in agreement with higher electron injection yields (Fig. 3c).

(b) The light-harvesting efficiency (LHE) plotted as a function of λ. (c) Current density–voltage (J–V) curves recorded under the illumination of 100 mW cm−2, simulated AM1.5G sunlight. An antireflection film was laminated on the top of a testing cell and the aperture area of the black metal mask was 0.160 cm2. 
The photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) characteristics (Fig. 5c) were recorded under the irradiance of 100 mW cm−2, simulated AM1.5G sunlight. As listed in Table 2, the transparent cell with dye C296 presents a short-circuit photocurrent density (JSC) of 16.87 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 811 mV, and a fill factor of (FF) 73.7%, affording a PCE of 10.1%. Meanwhile, the C298 cell has similar photovoltaic parameters to C296, showing a slightly higher PCE of 10.3%. The photovoltaic parameters of DSSCs with a scattering layer are better (Table S10†) but the devices are not transparent anymore. Note that the PCEs attained here with C296 and C298 are very impressive for see-through DSSCs using a mesoporous titania film with a thickness of only 4 μm. It should also be recognized that a lower energy gap dye may not generate a significantly improved PCE, owing to the complicated interplay of light absorption, charge generation, and charge recombination at the titania/dye/electrolyte interface.

We further covered the transparent DSSCs with a 50 μm-thick polyester film (Preservation Equipment Ltd., UK) as a UV cutoff filter (up to 400 nm), and submitted the cells for aging at 60 °C under a Suntest CPS Plus lamp (ATLAS GmbH, 100 mW cm−2). The cells were taken out at regular intervals and measured under AM1.5G conditions. Photovoltaic parameters after 1000 h light and thermal aging are also compiled in Table 2 for comparison with those for the fresh cells, and detailed evolution of JSC, VOC, FF, and PCE is shown in Fig. 6. In general, the C298 cell displays good durability, retaining 80% of its initial PCE (10.3%) after 1000 h aging, which is better than the 72% for the C296 cell with an initial PCE of 10.1%. Moreover, there is a 3.4% reduction in JSC after 1000 h aging of the C298 cell, which is however smaller than that of 10.2% for the C296 cell. While for both cells the reducing ratios of FF are less than 3%, their VOC decreased by over 125 mV, becoming the dominant thermal degradation factor of DSSCs with a cobalt redox electrolyte.

The J–V curves of both fresh and aged cells were also measured under different solar irradiances, which were generated by attenuating the simulated AM1.5G sunlight with a series of neutral metal meshes. As Fig. 7a and e show, the recorded VOC features a linear relationship with the logarithm of JSC. With one order of magnitude increase of JSC, the corresponding VOC increases by ∼77 mV for the fresh cells and 66 mV for the aged cells, indicating that aging should engender a small variation of the profile of trap states under the conduction band (CB) edge of titania. Notably, the 1000 h aging (light soaking at 60 °C) of a DSSC with either C296 or C298 caused a remarkable VOC drop at a given JSC (Fig. 7a and e). Therefore, charge extraction (CE)61 and transient photovoltage decay (TPD)62 measurements were carried out to uncover the possible change of interfacial energetics and kinetics underlying the VOC reduction. In Fig. 7b and f, VOC is plotted as a logarithmic function of extracted charge (QCE). It is worth noting from Fig. S17† that at a certain VOC, the fresh cells with C296 and C298 do feature undistinguishable QCE, suggesting that the CB edge and the trap state distribution profile of titania should not be affected by grafting different dye molecules. However, 1000 h aging even under moderate thermal stress of both cells brings forth a small downward movement of the CB edge of titania (Fig. 7b and f), which could be mainly ascribed to the sluggish intercalation of lithium ions into titania. Moreover, the remarkable acceleration of interfacial charge recombination (Fig. 7c and g) after thermal aging plays a major role in the VOC drop, apart from the minor role of the titania CB edge shift. Considering the invariable hole injection kinetics in the fresh and aged cells (Fig. 7d and h), the electron half-lifetime (tTPD1/2) reduction from aging must stem from the accelerated back electron transfer reaction from titania to Co(III) ions. Under thermal stress it is likely the Co-bpy ions may penetrate into the “dynamic” self-organized dye layer in contact with a liquid electrolyte, being closer titania, which enhances the wave-function overlap of the back electron transfer reaction. Filling the pinhole defects of the self-organized dye layer with multi-scale coadsorbents should be a feasible tactic to overcome this problem.

As reported in the literature DSSCs with the conventional iodine based redox couple normally presented excellent JSC stability during moderate thermal aging,21 thereby we were curious to understand the origins of the JSC loss observed for the C296 and C298 cells, by using several optical and impedance methods. In general, it seems that the observed JSC reduction is relevant to the reduced integrated photocurrent density from the photocurrent action spectra (Fig. 8a and e), where the decreased EQE values are detected in the infrared region. The C296 cell has a higher attenuation degree than the C298 cell. However, the light harvesting efficiencies (Fig. 8b and f) for both cells are nearly not impacted by the dual stress of full sunlight soaking and thermal stress, indicative of strong bonding and photochemical stability of dye molecules on the surface of titania. Moreover, the overall yield of charge photogeneration (electron injection and hole injection) is also not likely to be affected by comparing the kinetic traces of femtosecond fluorescence and transient absorption of DSSCs measured before and after aging (Fig. 8c, g, 7d and h). It is worth noting from Fig. 8d and h that after aging the electron diffusion lengths (Ln)63 of the dyed titania films of both cells are obviously reduced, being shorter than the film geometric thickness (Fig. 8d and h). The aging-induced reduction of Ln is associated with the reduction of electron lifetime (τn), although there is an enlargement of the diffusion coefficient (Dn) as presented in Fig. S18.† It could be concluded that the significantly shortened Ln has a pronounced influence on the yield of charge collection, giving a clear clue on the deteriorative EQE response and the reduced JSC for the cobalt cells studied here.

Conclusions
We have synthesized two donor–acceptor organic dyes characteristic of a polycyclic heteroaromatic 6,11-dihydrothieno[3′,2′:8,9]chryseno[10,11,12,1-bcdefg]carbazole. These two dyes have been used to fabricate transparent dye-sensitized solar cells exhibiting excellent power conversion efficiencies of over 10% under the illumination of AM1.5G full sunlight. We have found that the cells using dye C298 with the 4-(benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazol-4-ylethynyl)benzoic acid electron acceptor present ∼80% efficiency retention after 1000 aging under full sunlight soaking at 60 °C, which is better than that of C296 with the 4-(benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazol-4-yl)benzoic acid electron acceptor. The device degradation is mainly caused by the photovoltage drop due to the accelerated interfacial charge recombination under thermal stress, which should be addressed in the future study to speed up the application of transparent dye solar cells in building integrated photovoltaic systems.
Experimental section
Materials
THF, acetonitrile, ethanol, and PhMe were distilled before use. LiTFSI, EMITFSI, DMFc, Fc, and TBP were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used without further purification. The synthetic details of C296 and C298 can be found in the ESI.†
Theoretical calculation
DFT and TD-DFT calculations were executed with the Gaussian 09 program suite, using the 6-311G(d,p) basis set for all atoms. The conductor-like polarized continuum model (C-PCM) was applied to compute the solvent effect of PhMe and THF. Optimization of ground-state geometries was carried out by using the popular B3LYP exchange-correlation functional. The TD-MPW1K hybrid functional characteristic of 42% of Hartree–Fock exchange was utilized to calculate the vertical electronic transitions and the excited-state properties.64,65
Photophysical characterization and data analysis
UV-Vis spectra were measured with a G1103A spectrometer (Agilent). Fluorescence spectra were recorded using a calibrated QEPro spectrometer (Ocean Optics). Femtosecond fluorescence kinetic traces were monitored with an upgraded time-resolved fluorescence spectrometer (Halcyone Fire, Ultrafast System). The fundamental pulses were generated from a Ti:Sapphire laser system (Astrella, 800 nm, 35 fs, 7 mJ per pulse, 1 kHz repetition rate, Coherent Inc.) and divided into two portions: the primary part was delivered to one optical parametric amplifier (OPA) to generate the pump pulse (530 nm), and the secondary portion was dispatched to another OPA to generate the gate pulse (1200 nm). Both the fluorescence emitted from a testing sample with the in-plane random motion and the 1200 nm gate pulses were focused onto a BBO crystal to generate sum frequency light, which then passed through a monochromator. The diffracted light was detected using a photomultiplier tube (PMT). Sub-nanosecond kinetic traces of transient absorption (TA) were tested with a pump-probe transient absorption spectrometer (EOS, Ultrafast System). The time-dependent fluorescence intensities (IFL) at all observed fluorescence wavelengths of each sample were globally fitted with several time constants according to eqn (1), (1)where Ai, t, τi, and IRF are the fractional amplitude, delay time, time constant, and instrumental response function, respectively. The amplitude-weighted average lifetimes () of fluorescence decays were calculated using eqn (2), (2)
The electron injection yield (ϕei(λ)) at a certain fluorescence wavelength (λ) was calculated with eqn (3), (3)where (A,λ) and (T,λ) are the amplitude-weighted average lifetimes for the dyed alumina (A) and titania (T) samples, respectively. The calculation of electron injection time constant (ei(λ)) is based on eqn (4), (4)
The transient absorption traces at 1300 nm (Fig. 4) were fitted with a multi-exponential function for easy determination of the half-reaction time constants (t1/2). The calculation of the hole injection yield (ϕhi) is based on eqn (5), (5)where tinert1/2 and tCo-bpy1/2 are the half-reaction time constants for the dyed titania films in contact with an inert electrolyte and a Co-bpy electrolyte, respectively.
Cell fabrication and electrical measurements
Onto FTO glass (1.6 mm, white glass, NSG) deposited a highly transparent mesoporous titania film with a 4 μm thickness via screen-printing, which was used as the negative electrode of a DSSC. No light-scattering layer was used if there is no specific claim. For film-making details, please refer to a previous paper.66 Dye-loading was performed by dipping a titania film into a 150 μM dye solution (5 ml) for 16 h. No coadsorbent was added to the dipping solution. Solvent mixtures of PhMe and ethanol were used at a volume ratio of 1/9 for C296 and 3/7 for C298. The PhMe percentage was carefully modulated to prevent an observable dye precipitation from solutions for at least 24 h, and at the same time to attain a dye-loading amount as high as possible. A dyed titania electrode was stuck to a platinized FTO electrode under a certain mechanical pressure using a Surlyn O-ring (thickness: 25 μm) at 125 °C. The composition of the Co-bpy electrolyte used in this work is as follows: 0.25 M tris(2,2′-bipyridine)cobalt(II) di[bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide, 0.10 M tris(2,2′-bipyridine)cobalt(III) tris[bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide], 0.1 M TBP, and 0.1 M LiTFSI in acetonitrile. Detailed device measurements including EQE, J–V, CE, TPD, and impedance spectroscopy were the same as described in our previous studies.67,68
