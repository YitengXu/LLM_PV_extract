    , Accepted 18th May 2015First published on 18th May 2015AbstractBlends of alternating ‘push–pull’ donor/acceptor (d/a) co-polymers with soluble fullerenes as active materials have shown promise for increasing power conversion efficiencies in organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices. We investigate morphology-dependent optical and electronic properties of poly[2,6-(4,4-bis-(2-ethylhexyl)-4H-cyclopenta[2,1-b;3,4-b′]dithiophene)-alt-4,7(2,1,3-benzothiadiazole)] (PCPDTBT) blended with [6,6]-phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) using electronic absorption and resonance Raman spectroscopies. Selective resonance excitation spanning the entire PCPDTBT absorption envelope (∼400–900 nm) was used to probe via Raman spectroscopy the degree of composition- and conformation-dependent charge transfer character along the polymer backbone. Raman intensities of characteristic PCPDTBT backbone donor/acceptor moieties vary with excitation wavelength. We perform density functional theory (DFT) calculations to assign Raman-active vibrational modes and correlate polymer backbone conformations to the degree of intra-chain donor/acceptor charge transfer character. We find the best agreement between experimental and simulated spectra for planarized PCPDTBT backbone consistent with strong charge transfer character along the backbone, which also gives rise to a new red-shifted absorption band appearing in PCBM blends. Resonance Raman and photocurrent imaging experiments were next used to spatially map morphology-dependent vibrational signatures of PCPDTBT donor/acceptor moieties within functioning solar cell devices. Solvent additives were applied using 1,8 octanedithiol (ODT) to modify PCPDTBT:PCBM morphologies and compared to as-cast blends. Raman and photocurrent images indicate a well-mixed morphology that we propose induces planarization of the PCPDTBT backbone.
Introduction
Alternating donor/acceptor (d/a) co-polymers have shown considerable promise for improving the power conversion efficiencies of organic solar cells based on bulk heterojunction (BHJ) conjugated polymer and fullerene blends.1–4 Charge transfer character along the polymer backbone gives rise to the ‘push–pull’ effect leading to substantially red-shifted absorption transitions, thus more effectively capturing NIR photons. Blends of poly[2,6-(4,4-bis-(2-ethylhexyl)-4H-cyclopenta[2,1-b;3,4-b′]dithiophene)-alt-4,7(2,1,3-benzothiadiazole)] (PCPDTBT) and similar copolymers with soluble fullerenes, e.g., [6,6]-phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM), are prototypical examples of polymer blend BHJ solar cell systems with power conversion efficiencies (PCE) often exceeding 5%.5–9
The push–pull character of alternating co-polymers and small molecules alike is sensitive to the conformation (orientation) of d/a units as well as packing in the condensed phase. Much less understood is how these structural factors impact photovoltaic processes taking place in the excited state on early timescales following photoexcitation. In PCPDTBT:PCBM and related blend systems, exciton scission has been reported on ultrafast timescales (<100 fs) with near unity quantum efficiency which is essential for minimizing unwanted losses due to exciton thermalization.10–12 This ‘hot’ exciton dissociation effect occurs when free charges (polarons) are generated on similar timescales as vibrational energy dissipation of excess excitation energy. This mechanism requires sufficient electronic coupling between higher energy singlet excited states to charge separated (CS) states and vibrational reorganization energies (λ) must be smaller than this coupling (V). Grancini et al. reported V/λ ratios greater than 1 for PCPDTBT:PCBM blends indicating this mechanism is indeed viable.11 However, external quantum efficiencies (EQE) of PCPDTBT:PCBM solar cells are much lower than expected. Ultrafast spectroscopic studies by Yamamoto et al. demonstrated evidence for efficient charge recombination via interface charge transfer states, which was proposed to be the chief mechanism responsible for degradation of EQEs (Scheme 1).13

Improvements in material performance figures of merit (e.g., EQE and PCE) can be realized using facile processing methods to tune interface nanomorphologies. Solvent additives have proven effective for this purpose that selectively solvate one blend component to promote phase separation and greater polymer crystallinity and order. Upon treating BHJ blends with additives, solar cell PCE values tend to increase presumably from suppressed charge recombination due to a reduction of polymer/fullerene interfacial contacts.14–17 In PCPDTBT:PCBM blends, optical absorption spectra show pronounced red-shifts with additives, such as 1,8-octanedithiol (ODT), suggesting enhanced polymer ordering due to nanoscale phase segregation.8,9,18,19 Indeed, grazing X-ray scattering techniques found that PCPDTBT π–π stacking correlation lengths can be improved in PCBM blends by solvent additives.20 Unfortunately, correlating microscopic structure and morphology to the outcomes of competing electronic processes is less straightforward. In particular, the congested nature of PCPDTBT:PCBM optical absorption spectra tend to mask subtle variations in structure and morphology leading to incomplete structure-function information.11,21–23
Many limitations imposed by conventional one-photon spectroscopies to probe specific interactions between d/a monomer units of PCPDTBT and with fullerenes can be overcome using two-photon scattering spectroscopic techniques, such as resonance Raman spectroscopy. Raman transitions originate and terminate on well-defined, but different, vibrational levels of the ground electronic state, resulting in chemically specific views of polymer structure and conformation as well as sharp spectral features. By tuning excitation energies on resonance with intermediate (excited) states, the non-stationary vibrational wavepacket (i.e., ground state vibrational wavefunction) samples the excited state(s) potential surface(s) for each displaced mode before returning to the ground state. Strong enhancements of Franck–Condon active vibrations usually result from systems with large absorption cross-sections, which provide detailed views of the mode-specific excited state geometrical rearrangements. Raman processes are also highly sensitive to the local environment of the resonant chromophore giving this technique an additional advantage for elucidating ground state structure and interactions. Reish et al. applied resonance Raman spectroscopy techniques to study the related d/a alternating co-polymer, poly[N-1-octylnonyl-2,7-carbazolealt-5,5-(4′,7′-di-2-thienyl-2′,1′,3′-benzothiadiazole)] (PCDTBT), blended with PCBM and found that Raman patterns changed significantly with excitation energy due to selective excitation of specific structures that are otherwise buried underneath an inhomogeneously broadened absorption spectrum.22
Here, we use resonance Raman spectroscopic techniques to study ground state structure and local ordering of PCPDTBT in PCBM blends. By selectively exciting Raman spectra across the PCPDTBT absorption profile, it is possible to select distinct chromophores that vary in d/a conformation. These structural characteristics are also affected by local morphology that we investigate using resonance Raman and photocurrent imaging approaches in functioning solar cell devices. Density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) simulations of Raman intensities and frequencies are also performed correlate observed Raman intensities to the degree of charge transfer along the polymer chain.
Results and Discussion

Fig. 1 shows optical absorption spectra for a spin-cast film of pristine PCPDTBT, PCPDTBT nanoparticles, and thin films of a 1:2 (w:w) blend of PCPDTBT:PCBM and a 1:2:3 (w:w:w) blend of PCPDTBT:PCBM:ODT. The pristine polymer and blend films show two distinct absorption maxima characteristic of donor–acceptor copolymers.9,11,13,19,22,24,25 Arrows in (b) indicate positions of Raman excitation wavelengths relative to the absorption spectra (vide infra). The blend spectrum shows a characteristic absorption peak for PCBM around 330 nm, and a slight shoulder at 430 nm from the relatively small PCBM absorption peak at that wavelength. The PCPDTBT:PCBM blend spectrum exhibits a red-shifted low-energy peak at ∼750 nm consistent with increased phase separation between the polymer and fullerene acceptor. This transition becomes enhanced in films treated with ODT, demonstrating increased ordering within PCPDTBT indicating increased PCBM aggregation.

For comparison, PCPDTBT nanoparticles (∼40 nm diameter) were fabricated by reprecipitation in solution to investigate the effects of physical confinement on exciton absorption transitions. Absorption spectra of these solution dispersions were measured (Fig. 1a) that display diminished absorbance and broadening of the ∼750 nm transition in addition to a new transition(s) emerging at ∼630 nm. We propose this blue-shifted transition originates from disordered polymer chains as a result of rapid formation of nanoparticles in the chloroform/water/surfactant solution. It is noteworthy that solution phase absorption studies of pristine PCPDTBT do not exhibit these absorption features, implying greater conformational and packing order.
Turning to blend absorption spectra, the prominent red-shifted absorption feature appearing when PCBM is added or from treatment with ODT is consistent with previous assignments of enhanced local order within polymer domains. This behaviour is similar to aggregating polymers where a larger red-shift and linewidth narrowing have been attributed to increased order and interchain electronic communication. However, the bulky nature of the alkyl side groups probably impedes these interactions and instead increased intrachain order is indicated as the origin of increased red-shifted absorption strength. Gelinas et al. presented absorption spectra for the closely related small molecule, 7,7′-(4,4-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-4H-silolo[3,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl)bis(6-fluoro-4-(5′-hexyl-[2,2′-bithiophen]-5-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5] thiadiazole) (p-DTS(FBTTh2)2), with features very similar to those of PCPDTBT.10 Namely, a partially resolved low-energy absorption feature was correlated with increased ordering with DIO as the processing additive using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and grazing incidence wide angle X-ray scattering analysis.26 Additional insight into the conformational characteristics of d/a co-polymers can be obtained from single molecule spectroscopy studies of small molecule d/a analogs. Vacha and co-workers demonstrated the importance of the twist angle between d/a chain segments (intrasegment configuration) in determining lineshapes and energies where increased planarity (i.e., smaller d/a twist angle) leads to increased d/a charge transfer character and spectral red-shifts.27 These aspects are considered in more detail below.
It is also noteworthy that regardless of specific d/a orientations in either small molecules or alternating co-polymers, excited state electron density tends to localize on the acceptor (BT) units.2,11,13,28 Because absorption spectroscopy probes the excited state potential landscape, the red-shifted absorption feature in PCPDTBT can be most readily attributed to transitions localized on the BT units. Closer inspection of this lineshape reveals a small dip possibly corresponding to either a partially resolved vibronic progression or a distinct electronic state. The latter has been effectively ruled out in PCPDTBT from time-dependent DFT calculations of excitation energies and cross-sections.11 Higher energy transitions, on the other hand, are less sensitive to the processing method used, which is consistent with localized transitions centered on the CPDT units of the PCPDTBT monomer. In the case of a new higher energy peak in PCPDTBT nanoparticles, this feature may arise from disordered chains (i.e., large d/a twist angle) that suppresses charge transfer between the CPDT and BT units.
Steady-state photoinduced absorption (PIA) spectra of pure PCPDTBT films were also measured to assess the potential contributions of other excited states, such as polaron and triplet transitions. PIA spectra show a broad band appearing at ∼850 nm and extending into the near infrared when exciting at 405 and 650 nm (see ESI†). Distler and co-workers have attributed a lower-energy (∼1300 nm) photoinduced absorption peak to a T1 → Tn transition in pristine PCPDTBT following intersystem crossing from the S1 state.28 It is more likely that PIA spectra of pristine PCPDTBT originate from either polaron or singlet exciton transitions. Unfortunately, the broadened and overlapping absorption transitions shown in Fig. 1 complicate molecular views of charge transfer character along the PCPDTBT backbone. We attempt to overcome these limitations by using resonance Raman spectroscopy. This two-photon scattering process samples the excited state chromophore potential energy surface before returning back to an excited vibrational level of the ground electronic state. By comparing Raman lineshapes as a function of excitation energy (wavelength) it is possible to unmask contributions from structurally distinct conformers that are otherwise buried in one-photon absorption lineshapes.

Fig. 2 shows Raman spectra for PCPDTBT:PCBM blend films between 1100 cm−1 and 1700 cm−1 collected at excitation wavelengths from 387 to 850 nm. All Raman spectra were scaled by dividing intensities by absolute energies in order to remove dependence of excitation energies and assignments are given in Table 1. Background fluorescence was especially strong in pristine PCPDTBT thin films making Raman measurements difficult even for higher energy (short wavelength) excitation. Addition of PCBM suppressed PCPDTBT fluorescence due to quenching by efficient photoinduced electron transfer. Despite the presence of PCBM acceptors, ground state polymer:fullerene electronic interactions were negligible. Furthermore, the larger absorption cross-sections of the PCPDTBT ensure that observed Raman signatures reflect the polymer component. Due to the lack of a suitable intensity standard for use in all spectrometers used in our study, spectra are normalized to the 1342 cm−1 peak to allow for comparisons in relative intensities between Raman modes. Similar comparisons have been made for Raman spectra of related d/a co-polymers and homopolymers in lieu of a non-absorbing intensity standard, which provide a qualitative basis for comparing changes in relative Raman cross-sections.29–31

BT C–C stretch: in-plane C–H wag







The relatively large number of Raman active modes and their dependence on excitation energy is consistent with the appearance of a weakly resolved vibronic progression in absorption spectra, namely, multiple overlapping progressions over a large frequency range. We performed density functional theory (DFT) simulations of Raman spectra using CPDTBT oligomers to first establish a basis for comparing specific vibrations to d/a units as well as their orbital parentage. Previous Raman studies of related polymers, such as poly(9,9-di-n-octylfluorene-alt-benzothiadiazole) (F8BT) and PCDTBT, show similar trends as observed in Fig. 2 and we use these as a guide for assigning modes of PCPDTBT. Raman studies of F8BT identified the fluorene ring symmetric stretching mode at 1608 cm−1 and the BT ring stretch at 1545 cm−1.32 Reish et al. have also provided assignments for the related d/a PCDTBT system, such as the BT C–H wag coupled with the thiophene C–H wag at 1374 cm−1, the thiophene ring stretching mode coupled with a thiophene and carbazole C–H wag at 1447 cm−1, the BT symmetric C–H wag coupled with a thiophene asymmetric C–H wag at 1541 cm−1, and the carbazole ring stretching mode and its coupled C–H wag at 1623 cm−1.22 The lower-frequency Raman modes at 844 and 874 cm−1 are tentatively assigned by these authors as in-plane bending modes of the dithiophene benzothiadiazole group. Furthermore, Reish et al. found increased BT intensity when excitation light is resonant with the low-energy absorption peak whereas excitation light resonant with the high-energy absorption peak of PCDTBT showed greater activity of donor carbazole units. Similar trends are found in PCPDTBT Raman spectra that reflect the degree of d/a conformation-dependent charge transfer character along the backbone. Provencher et al. also identified shifts in the BT in-plane C–H wag at 1262 and 1260 cm−1 for the PCDTBT cation and neutral molecules, respectively.12 PCPDTBT:PCBM Raman transitions in this range show no apparent contributions from the cation polymer form confirming that polymer:fullerene charge transfer interactions are weak in the ground electronic state.
In our present study, DFT simulations are carried out using several functionals including CAM-B3LYP, OPBE, and B3LYP to calculate Raman spectra for CPDTBT trimers with abbreviated side chains (see ESI†). We found that the B3LYP functional with the 6-311(p,d) basis set provided relatively good agreement with experimental frequencies and intensities (see ESI†). It is also interesting to note that reduction of exchange energies led to substantial deviations from the experimental results in Fig. 2 suggesting excitons are more localized. Vibrational mode assignments for the CPDTBT molecule using the B3LYP functional are given in Table 1. We turn our attention to the main backbone vibrations displaying the largest intensities in resonance Raman spectra (i.e., modes with the largest Franck–Condon displacements in the excited state). The 1342 cm−1 mode corresponding to the BT in-plane ‘concert wave’ C–H wag shows the least sensitivity over all excitation energies used in Fig. 2. Beginning at higher excitation energies, we observe larger relative activity of the CC stretch localized on the CPDT units (1423 cm−1). The CC symmetric stretch mode of PCBM is also observed at ∼1466 cm−1 in the range of 387–532 nm excitation, which is expected due to its larger oscillator strength at higher energies. As excitation energies decrease, approaching resonance with the main PCPDTBT absorption band, Raman transitions localized on the BT units become more prevalent, although CPDT intensities are still appreciable. Because only the low energy region of the PCPDTBT absorption spectrum is affected by PCBM and ODT, this behavior may be due to increased planarization of the polymer backbone d/a units and increased delocalization of the wavefunction over the BT and CPDT groups, as noted in earlier reports of related d/a co-polymers and small molecules.27,32 Decreasing excitation energies results in lower intensities of CPDT-centered vibrations and increasing intensities of the BT unit, most notably the 1269 cm−1 in-plane C–H wag.
HOMO and LUMO level iso-surfaces are calculated and shown in Fig. 3 for a 0.01 isovalue. Similar to other computational studies of donor–acceptor, or push–pull co-polymers, our calculations show relatively delocalized electron densities in the HOMO and more localized densities in the LUMO, specifically on BT units even when backbone d/a orientations are fixed in a planar conformation.21,22,32,33 Provencher et al. showed similar results for PCDTBT, with increased wavefunction localization on the BT acceptor moiety in the LUMO for the neutral species.12 Likewise, in F8BT, when the F8 (donor) and BT (acceptor) moieties are coplanar, calculations show increased localization in the LUMO state compared to the HOMO.32,34,35 When the plane of the BT group is perpendicular to the of the F8 groups, however, almost complete localization of charge density occurs on the F8 groups in the HOMO and on the BT group in the LUMO. Although we did not investigate the effects of torsional angle between the CPDT and BT moieties in our calculations, it is reasonable to assume that an increase in torsional angle between PCPDTBT d/a monomer units would result in increased localization of the wavefunction in the ground and excited states. HOMO isovalues indicate enhanced delocalization of charge densities and charge transfer between d/a units consistent with greater backbone planarity. This scenario likely represents a lower energy vibrational reorganization barrier for charge transfer from the polymer to fullerene acceptors in functioning solar cell devices and is consistent with improved EQE and PCE values when PCPDTBT:PCBM blends are treated with solvent additives. In a similar manner, Grancini et al. suggested that larger electronic coupling between higher energy PCPDTBT exciton states and charge separated states can overwhelm vibrational reorganization energies making hot exciton dissociation efficient.

In summary, our DFT results are consistent with strong charge transfer character amongst the donor–acceptor repeat units of the PCPDTBT backbone due to greater planarity of the d/a monomer units. The optimized geometry calculated for the PCPDTBT trimer is arched as a result of the cis arrangement of the branched alkyl group arrangement on CPDT groups, and is essentially planar. These results correlate well with those calculated by Risko et al. where a PCPDTBT tetramer displayed a planar, arc-like conformation with a small torsional angle between the CPDT and BT groups.36 It is useful to note that simulations of CPDTBT oligomers with the branched alkyl groups in the trans conformation resulted in similar energy minima as the cis conformation used here and ref. 36.37 This conformation is probably more realistic in the solid state because it minimizes steric crowding of the alkyl groups and better enables interchain stacking. We compared Raman spectra from both cis and trans CPDTBT trimer conformations and found overall patterns and vibrational character to be similar (see ESI†). Risko et al. further showed that HOMO–LUMO energy gaps of CPDTBT tetramers are relatively insensitive to oligomer size consistent with a highly localized electronic structure.36 We did not perform time-dependent DFT simulations on the trans conformer to confirm if excited state localization resulted in similar patterns as the cis conformer reported here but it is expected that the vibrational character will not be significantly affected by the arrangement of monomer d/a components.
We further examined CPDTBT trimers with a PCBM molecule over the CPDT and BT group were also optimized that show a slightly distorted polymer geometry with the plane of the polymer backbone bending very slightly around the fullerene (not shown). Thus far, DFT and spectroscopic results demonstrate that short-range ordering and chain conformation characteristics exert the greatest influence on optical and electronic properties.
The above correlations between d/a monomer conformations and resulting optical and Raman signatures can be further verified by considering small molecule d/a analogs where conformational and morphological heterogeneity are minimized. Vacha and co-workers performed single molecule fluorescence and excitation spectroscopy studies on small molecule d/a systems processed in different solvents to tune d/a twist angles.27 They demonstrated that large modulation of emission and absorption energies occurs in cases where a greater twist angle exists between individual d/a units resulting in blue-shifted spectra and greater localization of charge densities on the respective segments. Electronic communication within the d/a molecule improves with planarity leading to red-shifted spectra and intensity redistributions within the optical line shapes. Because PCPDTBT alkyl side groups likely inhibit significant interchain exciton coupling interactions observed in conventional π-stacked polymer aggregate structures,9,20 it is apparent that red-shifted absorption features shown in Fig. 1 most likely originate from elongated and planarized chains with greater intrachain charge transfer character. These features are consistent with greater BT character in excitation energy dependent Raman spectra toward the red edge of the PCPDTBT absorption spectrum (Fig. 2) and increased localization of charge density on the BT groups found in DFT simulations.
It is now useful to consider how local morphology affects polymer structure where variations in composition (i.e., PCBM content) can significantly modulate backbone conformations and intrachain charge transfer character. We extend our studies to resonance Raman and photocurrent imaging of PCPDTBT:PCBM blends in functioning solar cells to understand how polymer structure is affected by local morphology. A key objective of these measurements is to spatially correlate local PCPDTBT conformational and packing characteristics. Fig. 4 shows Raman intensity images for a 10 × 10 μm area of a PCPDTBT:PCBM (1:2 w/w) solar cell device excited with higher energy (458 nm) and lower energy (647 nm) excitation. All images in Fig. 4 are from the same area and pixel values represent integrated peak areas for the given modes normalized to the 1342 cm−1 BT C–H wag mode. Devices with this blend of polymer and PCBM exhibit smaller scale phase segregation with no apparent crystallite formation. Raman and photocurrent images show an interpenetrating type of morphology with characteristic size scales on the order of a few hundred nm up to a micron. This morphology is similar to previously reported AFM studies of these blends and indicates strong polymer/fullerene interactions.8,9,38 The lack of significant phase segregation on larger size scales (i.e., greater than the diffraction limit) makes detailed comparisons of Raman intensities difficult. Comparing the activities of the polymer donor and acceptor moiety modes, we find that in general, areas of high 1269 cm−1 BT activity correspond to areas with lower 1466 cm−1 PCBM activity, and areas with high 1423 cm−1 C–C stretch activity correspond to areas of high PCBM activity. This result is consistent with our proposed origin of the BT-centered NIR absorption transitions and the stronger sensitivity of BT vibrations to thin film processing conditions.

Image scan ranges are 10 × 10 μm. Pixel values represent integrated peak areas and intensities are normalized to the 1342 cm−1 acceptor mode. 
Additional views of the morphology-dependent blend landscape are obtained using 647 nm excitation, which is off-resonance with PCBM, and mostly reveal details of the polymer structure and variations due to local composition. We again find correlations between areas of high 1269 cm−1 mode activity and low PCBM activity. However, areas of high 1423 cm−1 intensity are not well-correlated with areas of high PCBM activity (see ESI†). Since Raman efficiencies decrease with lower excitation energies, we expect less sensitivity of these modes to local morphology.

Fig. 5 shows Raman intensity images for a 10 × 10 μm area of a PCPDTBT:PCBM solar cell device processed with ODT in the active layer blend. Similar to Fig. 4 all images are normalized to the 1342 cm−1 mode. Phase separation is slightly more pronounced indicating greater phase purity, but overall, the sizes of morphological features are similar to PCPDTBT:PCBM devices not treated with ODT. Under 458 nm excitation, the correlation between the 1269 cm−1 mode and PCBM activity is less pronounced than for the non-ODT treated device which is depicted in Fig. 6. The weak 1269 cm−1 intensity at this excitation wavelength may contribute to the weak correlation between polymer and PCBM modes. However, Raman images generated with 647 nm excitation reveal areas of lower BT 1269 cm−1 activity adjacent to areas of higher 1466 cm−1 PCBM activity (at 458 nm excitation), suggesting charge transfer interactions between the polymer and PCBM. There is relatively good agreement between areas of high 1423 cm−1 C–C stretch activity of the CPDT component and high PCBM activity. Under 647 nm excitation, the correlations between the polymer modes and PCBM activity are similar to the non-ODT device; with a good correspondence between areas of high 1269 cm−1 activity and low PCBM activity, and less correlation between the 1423 cm−1 mode and the PCBM mode.

 Fig. 6  Raman images of the 1466 cm−1 PCBM mode under 458 nm excitation for (a) PCPDTBT:PCBM (10:20 mg ml−1) and (b) PCPDTBT:PCBM:ODT (10:20:30 mg ml−1) thin films. Images are of the same areas as in main article Fig. 4 and 5, respectively. 
We now explore the effect of excitation energy on local photocurrent production in these solar cells using photocurrent imaging. Fig. 7 shows photocurrent images of a PCPDTBT:PCBM:ODT solar cell device under 405 and 647 nm excitation for the same area used to generate Raman images but over a smaller scan range. The shorter wavelength excitation was produced from a laser diode (±5 nm bandwidth) and was chosen to selectively excite PCBM, which has a larger absorption cross-section in this region. Raman imaging was not possible using this excitation source but, from comparison of Raman spectra in Fig. 2, no significant shifts in band center frequencies were observed between 405 nm and 458 nm excitation. The magnitude of the photocurrent produced by the device at 647 nm is also ∼3× larger overall than under 405 nm illumination. This is consistent with the substantially larger absorption cross section of the main PCPDTBT absorption band. Similar to Raman images (Fig. 5), relatively small scale phase segregation is observed even with the incorporation of ODT. However, we find that regions of lower photocurrent production generated with 405 nm excitation are oppositely correlated with the same region under 647 nm excitation. This trend probably originates from direct excitation of PCBM in the former since PCPDTBT does not have an appreciable absorption cross-section at 405 nm. Lower photocurrent production in the same regions with 647 nm excitation do not directly excite PCBM implying these are in fact fullerene-rich domains.

Conclusions
We have shown that resonance Raman spectra generated from excitation wavelengths spanning the entire PCPDTBT absorption lineshape preferentially select specific vibrational modes on either the donor or acceptor backbone moieties. DFT Raman simulations are in good agreement with experiment and demonstrate strong intramolecular charge transfer character between d/a segments. Localization of charge density on the LUMO is consistent with previous studies of related push–pull alternating co-polymers. Further evidence of d/a contributions are found in excitation wavelength-dependent Raman spectra where longer wavelengths (lower energies) preferentially enhance BT vibrations. The absorption and Raman spectroscopic trends indicate that addition of PCBM induces conformational ordering (planarity) of PCPDTBT chains, consistent with enhanced intrasegment charge transfer similar to findings from related systems. Resonance Raman and photocurrent imaging of model solar cell devices indicate fullerene-induced phase separation on micrometer size scales, which is further enhanced from ODT treatments. These morphological characteristics suggest strong polymer/fullerene interactions, which should favor efficient photoinduced charge transfer.
