    , Accepted 24th April 2023First published on 25th April 2023AbstractThe development of visible light-responsive semiconductor photocatalysts has inspired extensive interest, but the number is very limited for the quantum dot (QD)-based ones. Herein, an emerging mono-elemental material, violet phosphorus (VP) QDs, was synthesized via liquid-phase exfoliation, whose lateral size and thickness could be tuned by varying the centrifugation speed. The VPQDs show a bandgap of 2.06 eV with potentials of conduction and valence bands straddled for the water reduction and oxidation, and the longitudinal destruction of VP exposes abundant surface active sites. More importantly, the VPQDs exhibit rapid photogenerated charge mobility and improved charge separation efficiency after loading with a Rh cocatalyst. Consequently, we give the first demonstration that the VPQDs as a novel 600 nm-class photocatalyst are active for H2 evolution under visible light irradiation, showing activities of approximately 18 and 80 times greater than that of bulk VP and black phosphorus QDs, and delivering an apparent quantum yield of 2.86% at 475 nm. To our knowledge, the photocatalytic H2 evolution rate of 3325.1 μmol h−1 g−1 observed on the VPQDs in this work should be the highest among all the mono-elemental-based photocatalysts.
Introduction
Developing photocatalysts that can absorb visible or near-infrared (NIR) light is of great importance in solar-to-hydrogen (H2) conversion, because visible and NIR light constitute approximately 43% and 52% of the solar energy spectrum, respectively.1–4 Quantum dots (QDs) are alternative nanomaterials that exhibit unique properties (e.g., large specific surface area, high molar extinction coefficient, strong visible light absorption, and abundant surface active sites) due to their quantum confinement effects.5–7 Semiconducting QDs can be regarded as zero-dimensional (0D) electron systems, in which electrons are confined in all three dimensions, and exhibit distinctive behaviour compared with that in the bulk form.8–11 This enables them to offer strong light absorption and bright narrowband emission in visible and NIR wavelengths, increasing the interest for exploring their application in photocatalysis. To date, semiconducting QDs, including transition-metal dichalcogenides (e.g., MoS2, CdS) QDs and perovskite (e.g., CsPbBr3, CH3NH3PbBr3) QDs, have been widely used in different photocatalytic systems,12–17 such as H2 evolution,12,13 CO2 reduction,14,15 and NH3 generation,16,17 in which their optical and electronic properties can be manipulated by tuning their size, shape, and doping. However, most QDs have been synthesized under the assistance of capping ligands, during which the residue of capping ligands is unavoidable to prevent effective contact between QDs and H2O in the photocatalytic H2 evolution reaction.18,19
Recently, two-dimensional (2D) mono-elemental nanomaterials (Xenes) have emerged as promising narrow-bandgap semiconductors owing to their high carrier mobility and adjustable band-edge positions.20,21 Moreover, engineering 2D-Xenes such as phosphorenes, antimonenes and borophenes into their 0D form in high yield can be easily realized by a liquid-phase exfoliation strategy, in which 0D-Xene QDs exhibited homogeneous water-dispersion without capping agents.22,23 However, the number of QDs based on 2D-Xenes are very limited. As a typical example, black phosphorus (BP) QDs have been extensively reported to be a promising photocatalyst toward H2 evolution, possessing a larger surface-to-volume ratio and more active sites than the bulk form.24 Unfortunately, the BPQDs are generally sensitive to H2O and O2, which has greatly plagued their practical application.25 Very recently, violet phosphorus (VP), the most stable phosphorus allotrope, is regarded as a promising visible light-responsive photocatalyst owing to its tunable bandgap (from 1.68 to 2.02 eV for bulk and monolayer VP, respectively) and high stability.26–28 However, as a new form of VP crystals, the synthesis of VPQDs with controllable size and thickness is challenging due to limitations in synthesis strategies.29,30 Thus, their potential application in photocatalysis remains unexplored.
Herein, VPQDs, an emerging mono-elemental material, were synthesized via a liquid-phase exfoliation method in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP), combining probe sonication and subsequent ice bath sonication (Fig. 1A). First of all, high-crystallinity VP was first prepared via a chemical vapor transport method as previously reported (Fig. S1†), in which Sn and SnI4 were used as transport agents and amorphous red phosphorus was used as a primary constituent.26,27 The prepared VP crystals could be further exfoliated into few-layered VP by a probe sonication process in the presence of NMP. Subsequently, a VPQD dispersion was obtained by longitudinal destruction of few-layered VP in the ice bath sonication. Moreover, the size and thickness of VPQDs could be finely tuned by varying the centrifugation range. With increase in the centrifugation speed, the size and thickness of VPQDs decreased. As a result, these smaller and thinner VPQDs enabled us to better understand their semiconducting properties. For the first time, the potential of VPQDs as a novel 600 nm-class photocatalyst for the H2 evolution reaction was explored, which provided a promising strategy by engineering 3D layered materials into the 0D form to enhance visible-light photocatalytic activity.

Experimental
Sample preparation

Synthesis of VP crystals. 
A mixture of amorphous red phosphorus (470 mg), Sn (10 mg), and SnI4 (18 mg) was sealed in a quartz tube under a vacuum of 10−4 pa. The quartz tube was placed horizontally in a muffle furnace. The empty side was kept at 450 °C for 6 h while the source region was kept at room temperature to realize the back transport process. The quartz tube was heated up where one end of the quartz tube with the phosphorus source was heated to 650 °C and the other empty end to 630 °C for 8 h. The sample was kept at these temperatures for 5 h and then cooled down to 100 °C for 10 h. The end with the phosphorus source was then kept at 550 °C with the other end at 530 °C for 30 h. The quartz tube was then slowly cooled to room temperature for 70 h. Both VP and BP were obtained. The yield of VP is about 36% and was then separated from BP.


Synthesis of VPQDs. 
VPQDs were synthesized by a liquid-phase exfoliation method combined probe sonication and subsequent ice-bath sonication in NMP.31,32 In this synthesis, 20 mg of VP crystals was ground in a mortar for about 30 min and then immersed in 50 mL of NMP and treated using a tip sonicator at a power output of 40 W under 5 °C water bath conditions for 6 h. Subsequently, the resulting dispersion was sonicated in an ultrasonic bath continuously for another 5 h. As a result, VPQDs were obtained by centrifuging at 3K rpm for 10 min to remove the bulk VP and then the dispersion containing VPQDs was further centrifuged at 11K rpm for 10 min. The VPQDs with a defined size and thickness was obtained by centrifuging at different speed ranges (e.g., 3–5K, 5–7K, 7–9K, 9–11K) for 10 min.


Deposition of cocatalysts. 
In this work, the decoration of the Rh cocatalyst by chemical reduction was applied.33 In the NaBH4 reduction, 10 mg of VPQDs was added to 20 mL of water and sonicated for several minutes. Subsequently, the required amount of RhCl3·3H2O was added to the solution followed by the addition of NaBH4 (1 mL, 0.1 M) with vigorous stirring. The resulting suspension was filtered to recover the product, which was then washed several times to completely remove any excess NaBH4.

Characterization
UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) data were acquired using a V-670 JASCO spectrometer recorded over the range of 250–900 nm. Raman microscopy was performed using a Thermo DXR 2xi Raman spectrometer equipped with excitation wavelengths of 514 nm. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images and the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images were obtained using a JEM-2100 microscope operated at an accelerating voltage of 120 kV and 300 kV, respectively. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data were acquired using a Thermo Scientific ESCALAB 250Xi spectrometer. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements were performed with a BRUKER-MultiMode 8 microscope. UV photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) data were collected by using a Nexsa spectrometer with a He lamp source. Photocurrent and electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) measurements were performed on a CHI 770 electrochemical workstation using a three-electrode cell with the 2D materials on FTO as the working electrode, and a saturated calomel electrode and a platinum electrode as the reference electrode and the counter electrode, respectively. Steady-state photoluminescence (PL) data and the corresponding PL decay measurements were determined using a Scientific FL3-2IHR spectrometer with an excitation wavelength of 370 nm. Time-resolved transient absorption spectra (TAS) were performed with a HALCYONE Fluorescence Life Measurement System (ultrafast system) equipped with a coherent chameleon oscillator seeded with a Ti/sapphire regenerative amplifier.
Density functional theory (DFT) calculation
All the DFT calculations were conducted based on the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP).34 The exchange–correlation effects were described by the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional within the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) method.35 The core–valence interactions were accounted by the projected augmented wave (PAW) method.36 The energy cutoff for plane wave expansions was set to 450 eV. The structural optimization was completed for energy and force convergence set at 1.0 × 10−5 eV and 0.02 eV Å−1, respectively. Grimme's DFT-D3 methodology was used to describe the dispersion interactions.37
Photocatalytic reactions
The photocatalytic reactions were examined in an All-glass Automatic On-line Trace Gas Analysis System (Labsolar-6A, Beijing Perfectlight). The photocatalyst was dispersed in 150 mL of a 20 vol% aqueous methanol solution. Prior to photoirradiation, the reaction system was evacuated to remove all air, then irradiated from overhead using a 300 W xenon lamp equipped with a dichroic mirror and a cut-off filter (λ ≥ 420 nm). The reactant solution was maintained at 283 K with a cooling water system during the reaction. The evolved gas products were analyzed using an online gas chromatography system consisting of a GC9790 chromatograph (FULI) equipped with a molecular sieve 5 Å column and a thermal conductivity detector, with high purity N2 as the carrier gas.
Apparent quantum yield (AQY) calculations
The AQY for the H2 evolution reaction based on one-step photoexcitation is given byAQY (%) = [2 × n (H2)]/n (photons) × 100,where n(H2) and n(photons) represent the number of H2 molecules generated and the number of incident photons, respectively. As measured and calculated, the total number of incident photons at the wavelength of 475 nm is approximately 5.149 × 1020 photons h−1.
Results and discussion
Crystal structure analysis reveals that the VP possesses a layered structure composed of violet phosphorene layers stacked along the c-direction (Fig. 1A and S2†). VP has a monoclinic crystal structure with a space group of P2/n (13). The crystallographic lattice constants of VP are a = 9.21 Å, b = 9.13 Å, c = 21.89 Å, β = 97.80°. Under probe sonication, bulk VP crystals are exfoliated into few-layered VP. Subsequently, the dispersion was further sonicated in an ice bath to induce longitudinal destruction of the atomically thin VP, affording abundant surface active sites.39,40 After centrifugation and re-dispersion in NMP, a stable yellow-colored dispersion of VPQDs was thus obtained with a yield of over 30% (Fig. S3 and Table S1†). TEM images reveal that the VPQDs obtained using a centrifugation range of 9–11K rpm are homogeneously dispersed with uniform size (Fig. 1B and S4†). The average lateral size of the VPQDs is approximately 6.2 nm (Fig. 1C). The HRTEM image indicates a lattice fringe of 0.45 nm, ascribed to the (020) or (200) facet of the VPQDs (inset of Fig. 1B).
The topographic morphology of VPQDs was examined by AFM (Fig. 1D), where the average heights measured along the lines of a, b, and c are 1.07, 1.15, and 1.01 nm, respectively (Fig. 1E). Statistical AFM analysis gives an average thickness of 1.12 nm, corresponding to two layers of VP (Fig. 1F). The prepared VPQDs present a flat conical shape, which was confirmed by the topography in the 3D AFM image (Fig. S5†). Moreover, the dependence of the lateral size and thickness of VPQDs on centrifugation was further investigated by AFM. The corresponding rough statistical graph of the lateral size and thickness of VPQDs versus centrifugation speeds is presented in Fig. 2. We can clearly find that, with decrease in the centrifugation range from 9–11K to 3–5K rpm, the lateral size of VPQDs increases from 6.2 ± 0.6 to 112.4 ± 21.6 nm, and the corresponding thickness of VPQDs increases from 1.12 ± 0.18 to 12.21 ± 3.86 nm (Fig. S6–S8†). In this case, VPQDs with controllable lateral size and thickness were obtained by varying the centrifugation speed of the VPQD dispersion.

The surface chemical composition of the VPQDs was analyzed by high-resolution XPS.41 As shown in Fig. 3A, the peaks of P 2p spectra with binding energy located at 129.6 and 130.5 eV are assigned to P 2p3/2 and P 2p1/2 of PP bonds, respectively, which are characteristic of crystalline VP. Moreover, the broad oxidized phosphorus (PxOy) peak can be deconvoluted into three peaks with binding energies located at 131.7, 133.4, and 134.5 eV, attributed to P–O–P, O–PO, and P2O5, respectively.26 Notably, compared with the bulk VP, VPQDs show a lower oxidized phosphorus content, indicating that the exfoliated VPQDs expose much more unoxidized P atoms for easy adsorption of H+ as well as efficient reduction (Table S2†).42 The Raman spectra in Fig. 3B contain three prominent signals at 353, 446, and 471 cm−1 for both VPQDs and the bulk VP using an excitation wavelength of 514 nm.27 Notably, the intensity ratio of the S[P9]2 to Tg peaks, ascribed to the stretching vibrational modes of [P9] at 353 cm−1 and the tangential stretching mode of [P9] along the tubular axis at 471 cm−1, respectively, changes from 0.68 for bulk VP to 0.77 for the VPQDs (Table S3†). This indicates that once VPQDs are formed, the surrounding molecules will be more significantly influenced by the S[P9]2 than by the Tg owing to quantum size effects.43

(D) The corresponding Tauc plots of bulk VP and VPQDs. UPS spectra of bulk VP (E) and VPQDs (F). (G) Estimated relative band positions of bulk VP and VPQDs. 
The semiconducting properties of VPQDs were investigated by UV-vis DRS. As illustrated in Fig. 3C, the absorption edge of VPQDs appears at approximately 600 nm, which is obviously blue-shifted compared to the bulk VP with an absorption edge of around 660 nm. Moreover, the blue-shift of the absorption edge on the VPQDs is similarly dependent on its average size and thickness as other QDs.44,45 The corresponding Tauc plots in Fig. 3D reveal that the bandgap of VPQDs with a size of 6.2 ± 0.6 nm and a thickness of 1.12 ± 0.18 nm (obtained at a centrifugation speed range of 9–11K rpm) was estimated to be approximately 2.06 eV, larger than that of the bulk VP (1.88 eV). This bandgap tunability of VP after exfoliation suggests the possibility of obtaining bandgap-engineered VPQDs from the bulk form. Moreover, UPS was performed to determine valence band maximum values (VBM; Fig. 3E and F). The VBM values (EVB) of the bulk VP and VPQDs were calculated to be 6.11 and 6.16 eV (vs. vacuum), respectively, using the excitation energy (21.22 eV) of a He lamp source subtracting the width of the UPS spectra of the bulk VP and VPQDs. Based on the equation: EVB (vs. NHE) = EVB (vs.vacuum) − 4.44 eV, the EVB of the bulk VP and VPQDs were established to be 1.67 and 1.72 eV (vs. NHE), respectively (Table S4†). Thus, the band positions of the bulk VP and VPQDs were estimated as illustrated in Fig. 3G. It was clearly found that the conduction band (CB) and VB of VPQDs straddled for the water reduction and oxidation, exhibiting promising potential in the overall water splitting reaction. Steady-state PL emission spectra revealed that the emission peak of the VPQDs was much stronger than that of bulk VP with an excitation wavelength of 370 nm (Fig. S9†), suggesting more enhanced radiative recombination of VPQDs due to their quantum size effects. This deduction was further confirmed by the time-resolved PL decay spectra (Fig. S10†). The VPQDs exhibited a lifetime of 0.79 ns, which is shorter than that of bulk VP (0.92 ns), demonstrating the rapid charge mobility of VPQDs from the interior emission centers to the surface active sites.46
Encouraged by the excellent semiconductor property of VPQDs and their suitable CB and VB positions, the photocatalytic H2 evolution from water was evaluated in the presence of methanol for the first time. Meanwhile, the loading content of the Rh cocatalyst was optimized experimentally (Fig. S11†). As shown in Fig. 4A, the H2 evolution activity of VPQD photocatalysts is found to depend on their size and thickness. With increase in the centrifugation speed range from 3–5K to 5–7K rpm, the photocatalytic H2 evolution activity of VPQDs increased, and the VPQDs with a size of 66.5 nm and a thickness of 9.45 nm (the centrifugation speed range of 5–7K rpm) exhibited the highest H2 evolution rate of 33.25 μmol h−1 (Fig. S12†). Notably, the H2 evolution rate of the optimized VPQD photocatalysts was approximately 18 times greater than that of bulk VP, and the AQY of VPQDs reaches 2.86% at 475 ± 10 nm. This can be ascribed to the rapid charge mobility as well as the larger number of exposed active sites of VPQDs. However, VPQDs exhibited decreased H2 evolution activity with further increasing the centrifugation speed range from 5–7K to 9–11K rpm, probably owing to the serious radiation recombination of VPQDs. For comparison, we synthesized BPQDs (Fig. S13†) and evaluated their photocatalytic H2 evolution activity as 41.2 μmol h−1 g−1, which is much lower than that of VPQDs in this work. This should result from the observation of numerous crystal defects on the BPQDs.42 It is worth noting that after optimizing the photocatalyst amount (Fig. S14†), the H2 evolution rate on the VPQD photocatalysts will reach 3325.1 μmol h−1 g−1, which is approximately 80 times that of the BPQDs (Fig. 4B). To the best of our knowledge, the VPQDs presented in this work exhibit the highest photocatalytic H2 evolution activity among all the 2D Xene-based photocatalysts reported (Fig. 4C and Table S5†).

For the measurement of AQY, the 300 W xenon lamp was equipped with various band-pass filters. (D) H2 evolution cycle stability test of the Rh-loaded VPQD photocatalyst. (E) H2 evolution rates of the Rh-loaded VPQD photocatalyst as a function of the cut-off wavelength of the incident light. 
The photocatalytic stability of VPQDs was examined by studying the cycles of H2 evolution from water. As illustrated in Fig. 4D, the first cycle exhibited relatively low H2 evolution activity, which is primarily attributed to the decomposition of residual NMP on the VPQD surface. In the next three cycles, continuous H2 evolution was observed with no obvious degradation, indicating the homogeneous water-dispersion as well as the good photochemical stability of VPQDs. This can be further confirmed by the XPS spectra of VPQDs (Fig. S15†), in which the intensity ratio of PxOy to PP in the XPS spectra of VPQDs after the cycle test remains almost unchanged compared with that of the sample before the reaction (Table S6†). Fig. 4E shows the H2 evolution rates of the VPQD photocatalyst as a function of the cut-off wavelength of the incident light. The similar trend of activity to its light absorption curve reveals that the H2 evolution reaction is photo-driven. It should be noted that a remarkable photocatalytic H2 evolution rate (0.21 μmol h−1) could be detected under an irradiation wavelength of over 600 nm, demonstrating its wide visible light utilization.
To clarify the photocatalytic mechanism of the VPQDs under visible light irradiation, time-resolved TAS under 400 nm excitation was conducted to track the real-time photogenerated charge dynamics. As shown in Fig. 5A and B, broad absorption bands over the range from 500 to 700 nm were observed for both Rh-loaded VPQDs and Rh-loaded bulk VP. Conventionally, the absorption band in the 450–1500 nm range is assigned to surface-trapped electrons.47–49 The concentration of electrons decreased in a multi-exponential manner at 0–600 ps due to charge recombination in VP. Fig. 5C displays the TAS decay curves at 550 nm for Rh-loaded VPQDs and Rh-loaded bulk VP. The curves could be fitted to a two-exponential function and the lifetimes are summarized in Table S7.† The average lifetime of the Rh-loaded VPQDs is 215.8 ps, much shorter than that of Rh-loaded bulk VP (681.8 ps), suggesting an improved mobility of electrons in the VPQDs and efficient electron transfer from the VPQDs to Rh.50–52 Similarly, after loading with a Rh cocatalyst, the PL emission intensity of the VPQDs was much lower than that of bulk VP (Fig S16†), which exhibited a different profile than that of samples without the Rh cocatalyst loading (Fig. S10†). Moreover, the corresponding time-resolved PL decay spectra reveal that the lifetime of the Rh-loaded VPQDs is 1.07 ps, which is longer than that of Rh-loaded bulk VP (0.98 ps; Fig. S17†). This indicates that the existence of an additional channel facilitates interfacial electron transfer from VPQDs to Rh, resulting in a high charge separation efficiency and thus contributing more electrons to the photocatalytic H2 evolution reaction (Fig. 5D).52

(E) Photocurrent transient responses of the bulk VP and VPQDs under visible light illumination. (F) EIS spectra of the bulk VP and VPQDs under visible light illumination. 
Photoelectrochemical measurements were performed to further confirm the charge separation ability of VPQDs. The transient photocurrent response of Rh-loaded VPQDs is almost three times higher than that of Rh-loaded bulk VP during repeated on/off cycles (Fig. 5E). Moreover, EIS reveal that the Rh-loaded VPQDs exhibit a smaller arc radius with respect to the Rh-loaded bulk VP, indicating a smaller resistance for the charge transfer in the VPQDs (Fig. 5F). The projected densities of states (PDOS) of the bulk VP and VPQDs were calculated by using density functional theory calculations. As illustrated in Fig. 6A and B, the bandgap of the bulk VP was about 1.52 eV, which increased to 2.24 eV after engineering its 0D form. This tendency is consistent with the results of DRS and Tauc plots in Fig. 3C and D. Notably, several electronic states associated with the exposed P sites generated by P–P bond breaking during exfoliation are observed between the VB and CB of the VPQDs. These states can serve as the electron transport medium that promotes efficient electron transfer from VPQDs to Rh and thus inhibits the recombination of electron–hole pairs in VPQDs (Fig. 5D).53,54 These results demonstrate that VPQDs are a promising visible light-responsive semiconductor and exhibit excellent potential in photocatalysis due to their rapid electron mobility as well as high charge separation efficiency.55,56

Conclusions
VPQDs with a lateral size between 6.2 and 112.4 nm and a thickness between 1.12 and 12.21 nm were controllably synthesized for the first time. The VPQDs have a direct bandgap of 2.06 eV with potentials of conduction and valence bands straddled for the water reduction and oxidation, and the longitudinal destruction of VP exposes abundant active sites. Spectroscopic characterizations and photoelectrochemical measurements revealed that the VPQDs exhibited a rapid charge mobility ability and improved the charge separation efficiency after loading with a Rh cocatalyst. We give the first demonstration that the VPQDs can work as a photocatalyst for H2 evolution, and deliver a benchmarking photocatalytic H2 evolution rate of 3325.1 μmol h−1 g−1, which is approximately 18 and 80 times greater than that of bulk VP and BPQDs, respectively. By engineering layered bulk crystals into their 0D form, the VPQDs presented in this work exhibit the highest photocatalytic H2 evolution activity among all the 2D mono-elemental nanomaterials, as it may open a new avenue of developing photocatalysts for more efficient H2 evolution.
