1. Introduction
Global climate change and energy shortages are forcing people to seek new and renewable energy.1 Inspired by nature, scientists have successfully discovered new renewable energy such as solar, wind, and tidal energy, and applied them in our daily life.2 However, the intermittency of this energy largely limits the scope of practical applications. Therefore, efficient and environmentally friendly energy storage and conversion devices are urgently needed to complete the storage and effective use of these new energy sources. Among many energy and conversion storage devices, electrochemical energy storage devices stand out,3,4 which have become an indispensable renewable energy source in people's daily lives. Electrochemical energy storage devices include various types of batteries and supercapacitors.5 Compared with electrochemical energy storage devices with high specific capacity and excellent rate performance, such as Ni–Zn battery,6 Zn–air battery,7 Zn–ion battery,8 Li–ion battery,9 and aluminum–air battery,10 supercapacitors have insufficient performance in this aspect. Therefore, this is the research object and key technique of future research for supercapacitors. In particular, as a kind of electrochemical energy storage device with excellent performance, supercapacitors have a long cycle life,11,12 higher energy density and power density,13,14 and attracted more and more attention and research interest. Combining the advantages of batteries and supercapacitors, obtaining electrochemical energy storage devices with high specific capacity, high power density and energy density, and long cycle life, has received extensive attention and study. The components of supercapacitors can be generally divided into electrode material, electrolyte, current collector, separator, and so on.15 As an important part of a supercapacitor, electrode materials play a vital role in its performance, which involve carbon material, metal oxide, metal nitride, metal hydroxide, metal carbide, and conductive polymer.15–18 These electrode materials have different energy storage mechanisms, which can be divided into carbon materials with electrical double layered capacitances (EDLCs) behavior, pseudocapacitance produced from conductive polymers and metal nitride/oxide/hydroxide, as well as the battery type behavior by nickel and cobalt based materials.15,19,20
For the practical application, the performance indexes of supercapacitors mainly include specific capacitance, energy density, power density, and cyclic stability. Among them, cyclic stability is a measure of how much capacitance is retained after a certain working time or a certain number of charging-discharging cycles, which is very important to evaluate the service life of supercapacitors.21 Here, we discuss the basic concepts, classification, influencing factors and standard test methods of the cyclic stability of supercapacitors electrode materials in detail. The energy storage mechanism and cyclic stability of various electrode materials and the relationship between them are summarized. The affecting factors and improvement methods for the cyclic stability of electrode materials are presented. Furthermore, the cyclic stability of supercapacitors devices is discussed. It provides the basis for the cyclic stability test of supercapacitors and promotes the development of electrode materials in the supercapacitors industry.
2. Basic information and standard test methods for cyclic stability
As an important index to evaluate the actual service life of supercapacitors, it is necessary to test the cyclic stability. However, there is a lack of uniform specification for testing conditions of cyclic stability for supercapacitors, which makes the evaluation basis of cyclic stability for materials lack of comparability. Therefore, this section mainly introduces the basic information of cyclic stability including its basic concepts, classification, influencing factors and standard test methods.
2.1 Basic concept of cyclic stability
There are few reports on the definition of electrode materials cyclic stability of supercapacitors. Liu et al. consider that cyclic stability of supercapacitors is a measure of how much capacitance is retained after a certain working time or a certain number of charging-discharging cycles.21 There are many factors influencing cyclic stability (see 2.3 for details), among which the setting of test conditions has a great impact on it. For example, when other conditions are same, the same material will show better cyclic stability at a smaller potential window or at a greater current density/scanning rate. Therefore, in order to avoid the occurrence, it is very necessary to standardize its test conditions. Only the cyclic stability obtained under standard and reasonable test conditions can be used to evaluate its actual service life better. Therefore, we think that the cyclic stability of supercapacitors is the capacitance retention rate of the electrode materials or devices under standard and reasonable test conditions, after a certain working time or a certain number of charging-discharging cycles.
2.2 Classification of cyclic stability
Starting from the definition, the cyclic stability of supercapacitor varies with electrode materials. Here, we classify the cyclic stability of supercapacitors on the basis of electrode materials into three categories according to their cyclic trends, which could be summarized as follows, and also shown in Fig. 1.
 Fig. 1  Classification of supercapacitors' cyclic stability: (a) type I with the capacitance retention rate close to 100% after long time cycle.

(c) Type III with the continued decline capacitance retention rate.

(i) After charging and discharging processes for a long cyclic number, the specific capacitance of the material has almost no attenuation and the retention rate is close to 100% even after several ten thousand cyclic numbers. The cyclic stability of most carbon materials with EDLCs behavior belongs to this type and is labeled as type I, as shown in Fig. 1a. For example, the biochar of soybean roots porous carbon has good cyclic stability of 98% capacitance retention after 10000 cycles at 5 A g−1 in 6 M KOH.37 Carbon based supercapacitors has the most commercialized prospect in all electrode materials. (ii) Type II as shown in Fig. 1b: in the initial stage of the cyclic stability test or the first half of the charging and discharging cycles, the electrode material will generate a self-activation process, by which the material itself changes from one equilibrium state to another new equilibrium state. In this process, the activity of the excited material increases. Due to the self-activation of the material, the specific capacitance has an obvious increase compared with the initial specific capacitance, and the retention rate is always greater than 100%. After the stage of self-activation, the capacitance retention rate drops to the original capacitance value, or is far less than 100%. For instance, the cyclic stability of CoFe-layered double hydroxides (CoFe-LDHs) belongs to type II, and after 100 cycles, the capacitance retention rate increases firstly; and after that the capacitance retention rate decreases gradually because of some certain reason.30 (iii) Since the beginning of the test, the specific capacitance of electrode materials keeps decreasing continuously. Some decrease extent is not pronounced, even after 10000 cycles, the capacitance retention rate can still reach more than 90% like the cyclic stability of the 2 D MoN film with an excess of 95% of the initial volumetric capacitance after 25000 cycles at a scanning rate of 100 mV s−1 in 1 M H2SO4.38 Some drop very fast. After hundreds of cycles, the capacitance retention rate is less than 30%, such as polypyrrole (PPy) film with only 6.4% capacitance retention rate after 200 cycles at 0.5 A g−1 in 1 M KCl.39 This type of cyclic stability is termed as type III cyclic stability (Fig. 1c). In Fig. 1, we also list several typically electrode materials for each type of cyclic stability of supercapacitances for further understanding.
2.3 Influencing factors of cyclic stability
The cyclic stability of supercapacitors is divided into three types, which are closely related to the influencing factors. The cyclic stability of supercapacitors is influenced by many factors, which is summarized in Fig. 2. First of all, the type of electrode materials directly determines the stability performance because of the different energy storage mechanism, such as carbon materials with EDLCs behavior showing high circulation stability, while metal compounds and conductive polymers with pseudocapacitance or battery behaviors exhibiting weak stability. Secondly, the structure and property of electrode materials also influence the cyclic stability of supercapacitors. Accordingly, a great number of studies have been done to develop advanced electrode materials to boost the stability of supercapacitors. Thirdly, the test condition for stability measurement should be paid great attentions as well as considering the other performance index; those include current density, potential window, scanning rate, test temperature, mass load, electrolyte composition, etc.

2.3.1 Type of electrode materials. 
Cyclic stability types of the electrode materials are closely related to the type of materials and their energy storage mechanism. (i) Cyclic stability of electrode materials with EDLCs behavior (such as carbon electrode materials) mostly belongs to type I, which is mainly due to the fact that the electrode material does not undergo chemical charge transfer reaction and phase change during the charging and discharging process. That is, charge storage is achieved through the physical process of reversible adsorption and desorption of ions on the electrode/electrolyte interface. Therefore, the capacitance hardly decays during long cycles, and the cyclic stability belongs to type I. (ii) Cyclic stability of battery-type and pseudocapacitance supercapacitor electrode materials (such as metal nitrides, metal oxides/hydroxides and metal carbides and other electrode materials) mostly belong to type II, which is due to the self-activation of the material, the specific capacitance has an obvious increase compared with the initial specific capacitance, and the retention rate is always greater than 100%. After the stage of self-activation, the capacitance retention rate drops to the original capacitance value, or is far less than 100%. (iii) Cyclic stability of conductive polymer electrode materials mostly belong to type III, which is attributed to the mechanism of conductive polymer is rapid and reversible p-type or n-type element doping and counter-doping redox in the polymer. The reaction enables the polymer reach a high charge storage density, generates a Faraday quasi-capacitance, and realizes electric energy storage. The conductive polymer electrode material easily causes the collapse of the material structure due to the violent expansion and contraction of the material volume during the charging and discharging process, so that the capacitance retention rate is less than 100%. Therefore, it is possible to design electrode materials with high specific capacitance, good cyclic stability, and excellent electrochemical performance by optimizing the energy storage mechanism. For the relationship between each electrode material and its cyclic stability (see Section 3).


2.3.2 Influence of test parameters. 
Test conditions (such as potential window and current density/scanning rate) have a great influence on the cyclic stability of electrode materials. For instance, an electrode material shows high specific capacitance at low current density while very weak value at high current density. At low current density/scanning rate, the electrochemical reaction of the electrode material takes place more fully and the electrochemical reaction rate approximately equal the charge transfer rate, thus exhibiting a high specific capacitance. With the progress of the electrochemical reaction, the active material will more or less dissolve in the electrolyte, thereby showing a decrease in cyclic stability. This situation is very normal. However, there are some cases where the current density/scanning rate is deliberately increased to test the cyclic stability. In this case, only a small number of active materials will participate in the electrochemical reaction, and the active materials dissolved during the reaction will be immediately replaced by the materials that did not participate in the reaction, thus exhibiting low specific capacitance and high cyclic stability. Similarly, it may cause difficulties in comparing the data to deliberately select the voltage range where the active material is insoluble in the electrolyte (lower than the normal voltage of the active material) to test the cyclic stability of the electrode material. The parameters of the test cyclic stability should be consistent with that of the CV and GCD tests. During the cyclic stability test, the parameter setting has different influence on each electrode material. Tables 1 and 2 respectively show the influence of current density/scanning rate and potential window on the cyclic stability of different electrode materials.

2.4 Standard test method for cyclic stability
It is regrettable that people always declare pretty high cyclic stability based on the test at very high current density but do not indicate the real capacitance value at this current density. As such, the test condition and the other relative index are the key things for correctly evaluating the supercapacitors stability, and the inconsistent standard for testing the cyclic stability of electrode materials makes the evaluation basis of the cyclic stability of electrode materials lacks comparability. Therefore, this section will introduce a standardized test for the cyclic stability of electrode materials of supercapacitors focusing on the determination of current density, scanning rate, and potential window parameters.
For all electrode materials, the setting of test parameters such as current density/scanning rate and potential window should be as consistent as possible with the parameters used to test other electrochemical properties such as cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charging–discharging (GCD) processes. The potential window should not be reduced or current density/scanning rate should not be increased in order to highlight the performance of cyclic stability. That is to say, within a certain rate performance range, the comparability of materials' cyclic stability obtained by the test is higher. And beyond this range, the specific capacitance of materials will be much lower than the maximum specific capacitance. On the contrary, within this range, the data is comparable even though the ultimate cyclic stability is not ideal. As for the selection of potential window, each electrode materials have a different potential window, and only under the appropriate potential window can correct test data be obtained. The selection of the potential window during the cyclic stability test should be consistent with the CV and GCD tests.
Moreover, in order to verify the correctness of this statement, we deliberately did a set of cyclic stability experiments on Ni(OH)2 electrode material at high current density (10 A g−1) and low current density (1 A g−1). As shown in Fig. 3, when the current density is 10 A g−1, the capacitance retention rate of the electrode material still reaches 100% after 10000 cycles, which belongs to the type I cyclic stability. But its specific capacitance is only 154 F g−1. When the current density is 1 A g−1, the specific capacitance of the electrode material is as high as 1421.8 F g−1 and its capacitance retention rate has dropped to 23.7% after 1200 cycles, which belongs to the type III cyclic stability. For Ni(OH)2 electrode material, as the current density is different during the test, the cycle type will also be different. Therefore, it is very necessary to standardize the test conditions for the cyclic stability of supercapacitor electrode materials, so as to avoid the increase in artificial control to confuse the audience.

In fact, the phenomenon of improving electrochemical performance through artificial subjective factors also exists in other energy storage systems. Just as Xiao et al. proposed that coulomb efficiency (CE) is usually used to estimate the cycle life of lithium ion batteries, but it is not very effective for monitoring the life of lithium metal batteries (LMBs). Due to the lack of standards related to the actual high-energy LMB, the measured CE itself varies greatly in different groups.71
2.5 Summary
Cyclic stability of supercapacitors is the capacitance retention rate of the electrode materials or devices under standard and reasonable test conditions, after a certain working time or a certain number of charging–discharging cycles. Cyclic stability types of the electrode materials are closely related to the type of materials and their energy storage mechanism. Cyclic stability of electrode materials with EDLCs behavior (such as carbon electrode materials) mostly belongs to type I, which is mainly due to the fact that the electrode material does not undergo chemical charge transfer reaction and phase change during the charging and discharging process. That is, charge storage is achieved through the physical process of reversible adsorption and desorption of ions on the electrode/electrolyte interface. Therefore, the capacitance hardly decays during long cycles, and the cyclic stability belongs to type I. Cyclic stability of battery type and pseudocapacitance supercapacitors electrode materials (such as metal nitrides, metal oxides/hydroxides and metal carbides and other electrode materials) mostly belongs to type II, which is due to the charge storage mechanism of the electrode materials related to the surface-controlled Faraday redox reaction. In the initial stage of the cyclic stability test or the first half of the charging and discharging cycles, due to the self-activation of the material, the specific capacitance has an obvious increase compared with the initial specific capacitance, and the retention rate is always above 100%. After the stage of self-activation, the capacitance retention rate drops to the original capacitance value, or is far less than 100%. Cyclic stability of conductive polymer electrode materials is mostly type III, which is attributed to the mechanism of conductive polymer is rapid and reversible p-type or n-type element doping and counter-doping redox in the polymer. The reaction enables the polymer to reach a high charge storage density, generates a Faraday quasi-capacitance, and realizes electric energy storage. The conductive polymer electrode material easily causes the collapse of the material structure due to the violent expansion and contraction of the material volume during the charging and discharging process, so that the capacitance retention rate is less than 100%. Therefore, it is possible to design electrode materials with high specific capacitance, good cyclic stability and excellent electrochemical performance by optimizing the energy storage mechanism. The main influencing factors of cyclic stability are the type of electrode materials and test parameters, which include current density, potential window, scanning rate, test temperature, mass load, electrolyte composition, etc. When other test conditions are appropriate, the current density/scanning rate for testing cyclic stability should be as close as possible to the current density/scanning rate when the maximum specific capacitance is obtained. The selection of the potential window during the cyclic stability test should be consistent with the CV and GCD tests.
3. Cyclic stability of different electrode materials and thier energy storage mechanism
There are many types of electrode materials for supercapacitors, including metal nitrides, metal carbides, metal oxides, metal hydroxides, metal sulfides, metal selenides, metal phosphides, conductive polymers, and carbon materials. This section will introduce the energy storage mechanism and cyclic stability of each electrode material in detail. According to different energy storage mechanisms, supercapacitor electrode materials can be divided into EDLCs, pseudocapacitors and battery-type behaviors.3,20,21,72 The schematic diagrams of the CV curves and GCD curves are shown in Fig. 4. The energy storage process of EDLCs is formed by the reversible adsorption/desorption process of electrolyte ions on the electrode/electrolyte interface, and does not involve electrochemical reactions and phase transitions, so the cyclic stability is generally good. The CV and GCD curves of this type of electrode materials are shown in Fig. 4a. Pseudocapacitors include surface redox pseudocapacitors and intercalation pseudocapacitors. The former stores charge through the oxidation–reduction reaction of anions and cations in the electrolyte on the surface of the electrode materials; while, the latter stores energy through the insertion/extraction of cations in the electrolyte into the crystal structure of the electrode material, which does not undergo phase change during this process. Compared with EDLCs electrode materials, the specific capacitance of these materials is generally larger, and the cyclic stability is relatively poor but not bad. Their CV and GCD curves (Fig. 4b and c) are similar to those of the EDLCs. The electrochemical reaction of battery-type electrode materials is controlled by electrolyte ion diffusion, which usually undergoes intercalation and/or alloying reactions of phase change ions. Therefore, the CV curve will have obvious faradaic redox peaks, and the GCD curve will have charging/discharging plateaus72,73 (Fig. 4d). Battery-type electrode materials have high energy density, but due to the slow material phase change kinetics involved in the charging and discharging process, they exhibit poor cyclic stability.

3.1 Metal nitrides
The high theoretical capacitance of the metal nitrides (VN has a capacitance of 1340 F g−1 at 2 mV s−1 (ref. 78)) as the anode material for supercapacitors has been widely studied in recent decades, involving niobium nitride (NbN),79 chromium nitride (CrN),80–82 molybdenum nitride (MoN),38,48 titanium nitride (TiN),23,32,49,50,74,83–87 iron nitride (Fe2N),88 cobalt nitride (Co3N),27 ferrous nitride (Fe3N),89 vanadium nitride (VN),51–53,78,90–92 and so on. Fig. 5 shows several metal nitrides electrode materials. Nevertheless, it is difficult to reach the practical application standard after the long-term test due to their specific charge storage mechanism different from that of carbon materials based on electric double layers.

Based on the results in literature, it can be known that most of the cyclic stability of metal nitrides belongs to the type III. Moreover, the different cyclic stability of the same nitrides had been reported inconsistently in the existing literature, which leads researchers to think what are the factors that affect the cyclic stability of nitrides? Choi et al. believed that the factors affected the cyclic stability of metal nitrides include crystal size, material load, electrolyte concentration, and potential window.78 VN is used as an example. Liu et al. used commercial VN as electrode materials, which only can maintain about 15% of the initial capacitance after 2000 cycles in 6 M KOH electrolyte at a scanning rate of 30 mV s−1.93 While in the same electrolyte and under the similar potential window, Balamurugan and his colleagues were able to make the cycle number of VN last up to 10000 (current density is 10 A g−1).76 Zhou et al. obtained that the capacitance retention rate of VN reached 88% after 500 cycles and the rate performance was 65% at 50 mV s−1, that the maximum specific capacitance was 247.5 F g−1 at 2 mV s−1 (ref. 49) (Fig. 6a and b). However, when testing the cyclic stability, the scanning rate is 100 mV s−1. If the scanning rate is 50 mV s−1 or the material rate capability of 100 mV s−1 is used for the cyclic test, the results will be more satisfactory. Choi et al. tested the cyclic stability of VN, the rate capability at 100 mV s−1 is 41.3% (the maximum specific capacitance is 1340 F g−1 at 2 mV s−1), and the material cyclic stability at 50 mV s−1 after 1000 cycles is 90%78 (Fig. 6c and d). The effect of current density on the cyclic stability of nitrides is reflected in various commonly used nitrides like TiN, and MoN, not just in VN. As we all know, VN uses the fast and reversible redox reaction on the surface to complete the storage of charge. At high current density, there are few active substances that can participate in the redox reaction, which leads to the rapid decline of capacitance. And when only a fraction of the active material is involved in the reaction, the portion of the material that is dissolved after the reaction is immediately replenished by the active material that is not involved in the reaction. Thus, it is only reliable to test the VN's cyclic stability at a current density where the specific capacitance is not significantly attenuated compared to the highest capacitance value.

Besides the current density and scanning rate, the working voltage range of the nitrides in the test process also affect its cyclic stability. This is because the redox reactions of the nitrides under different potential windows are different. Therefore, the results obtained by using the potential range where the reaction product is not dissolved in the electrolyte to test the cycle performance are significantly better than the results obtained by using the potential window consistent with the CV and GCD curves to test the cycle performance. Choi studied VN's cyclic stability under different potential window. And found that when the potential window was determined to be −1.2 to −0.3 V, after 1000 cycles the cyclic stability of VN was much higher than the result when the voltage window was −1.2 to 0 V. In their work, they chose −1.2 to 0 V for the test potential windows of CV and GCD curves.78 This also indicates that the appropriate potential window is crucial for redox reactions. Thus, it is also necessary to ensure that the potential window in the cyclic stability test is consistent with that in the CV and GCD tests. Shu94 and Xu92 also reported the exploration of different potential windows in their own work, and they got the same results as Choi. In addition to the study of VN, Ouendi and his colleagues, and Wang et al. also investigated the cyclic stability of WN and TiN under different potential windows,95,96 and cyclic stability of the same nitride under different potential windows is shown in Table 3.

3.2 Metal carbides
Metal carbides are formed by integrating carbon atoms into the gaps of their parent metals. They are generally considered to be a special type of interstitial compound with high melting point, high conductivity, and excellent mechanical and chemical stability, and good corrosion resistance.55,101 Metal carbides includes titanium carbide (Ti3C2),24,102–105 thallium carbide (TaC),33 molybdenum carbide (Mo2CTX/Mo2C),28,99,106–108 niobium carbide (NbC)100 and MXene (Ti3C2Tx),54,55,98,108–113etc.Fig. 7 shows some typical metal carbides applied as electrode materials in supercapacitors. For carbides, the surface termination of –F and –OH impedes the transport of electrolyte ions and is a key factor affecting the capacitance retention. Therefore, general formula is generally written as Mn+1XnTX (n = 1–3), where M represents metal atoms (Ti, Mo or V, etc.), X represents carbon atoms, and TX represents surface functional groups (such as hydroxyl, oxygen, fluorine, and so on). For the sake of simplicity, TX is often omitted, but this does not mean that there are no surface functional groups.114,115

As a new type of two-dimensional material, the energy storage mechanism of carbides is similar to that of metal nitrides. The difference is that the two-dimensional layer structure can ensure the adsorption and rapid transport of electrolyte ions, providing more electric double layer capacitance for the material, which makes carbide excellent electrochemical performance. Most metal carbides exhibit good cyclic stability, which belongs to Type II and Type III. However, the influence of current density/scanning rate on cyclic stability cannot be ignored. Ti3C2TX, as the most common type of carbide, has been extensively studied in recent decades. Gogotsi and colleagues116 obtained the mechanism of Ti3C2TX providing capacitance by in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) in conjunction with electrochemical experiments. The pseudocapacitance of Ti3C2TX was derived from the redox reaction of Ti atoms on the surface. The reversible redox reaction on the surface made the effect of current density/scanning rate on carbides consistent with that of metal nitrides. Jiang et al.54 monitored the cyclic stability of Ti3C2TX in the H2SO4 electrolyte at the current density of 20 A g−1, and found that after 20000 cyclic tests, the material was still able to maintain 98% of the initial capacity. In contrast, the Ti3C2TX reported in Peng's55 work had a capacity of only 5000 cycles at a current density of 4 A g−1, and had been reduced to 70% of its initial value. We think the reason for this is the same as nitrides. And we can see from Table 4 that this phenomenon is reflected in all kinds of carbides. Similarly, the selection of potential window in the testing process will also affect the cyclic stability of carbides. For instance, in the report of Li and colleagues109 on Ti3C2TX, it was found that when the current density was 1 A g−1 and the potential window was −1.2 to −0.3 V, after 10000 cyclic tests, only 34.9% of the initial capacitance could be maintained. However, when Xu et al.98 adjusted the operating potential range to −0.75 to 0.25 V, the specific capacitance of the Ti3C2TX did not decline after the same long-term test. As shown in Table 4, it's not hard to see that this is common for other carbides (Fig. 7).

3.3 Metal oxides
Metal oxides include nickel oxide (NiO),34,56–58,124–128 cobalt oxide (Co3O4),119,129,130 manganese oxide (Mn3O4, and MnO2),47,131–139 iron oxide (Fe3O4, Fe2O3, and α-Fe2O3),120,140–143 vanadium oxide (V2O5),29,59,60,121,144,145 molybdenum oxide (MoO2, MoO3−X, HXMoO3, and MoO3),25,146–150 titanium dioxide (TiO2)123,151–153 and copper oxide (CuO)61–63,154–159etc. (Fig. 8); it is a controversial material, because there are both pseudocapacitive behavior and battery-type behavior during the charging and discharging process. A detailed discussion of pseudocapacitive electrode materials and battery-type electrode materials can be found in these classic documents.3,21 The cyclic stability of metal oxides differs depending on the type of material, which exists in the three types (Type I, II, and III) of cyclic stability. Taking MnO2 as an example, it is well known that the capacitance of manganese oxide mainly comes from the pseudocapacitance, which is a reversible redox transition caused by proton and/or cation exchange in the electrolyte, and Mn (III)/Mn (II), Mn (IV)/Mn (III), Mn (VI)/Mn (IV) caused by the transition. The specific mechanism is as eqn (1):15,160 MnOα(OC)β + δC+ + δe+ ↔ MnOα−β(OC)β+δ(1)where C+ denotes the protons and alkali metal cations (Li+, Na+, K+) in the electrolyte, and MnOα(OC)β and MnOα−β(OC)β+δ indicate MnO2·nH2O in high and low oxidation states, respectively. From eqn (1), we can see that there are both cations and electrons in the redox process. Therefore, when the current density/scanning rate is large, the redox reaction rate is much lower than the electron transport rate for MnO2 with poor conductivity. This allows fewer materials to supply the capacitance, resulting in a rapid drop to a smaller value than the capacitance. If the current density/scanning rate is used to test the cyclic stability, the phenomenon that the capacitance value is very small and the cyclic stability is very superior will exist, as mentioned in the work of Bag, and Huang.131,132 On the contrary, in the reports of Xia and colleagues,133 if the cycle performance is studied with a smaller current density/scanning rate, the stability of MnO2 is far worse than that obtained by Bag's and Huang's results.
In addition to MnO2, other oxides also have similar situations. For example, the capacitance retention of the Ni–Co–O@CFP electrode reaches 93.65% after 5000 cycles at a high current density of 20 A g−1 (the rate capability is 85% at 10 A g−1)161 (Fig. 9a–c). The electrochemical performance of the Ni–Co–O@CFP is very good, but it would be more perfect if it shows rate capability of 20 A g−1 and then test the cyclic stability of the material, or test the cyclic stability of the material at 10 A g−1. Cao and co-workers test the electrochemical performance of porous NiO nanotube arrays, that rate capability is 84% at 40 A g−1, and the capacitance retention rate is still 93.2% at 2 A g−1 after 10000 cycles34 (Fig. 9d and e). Poor conductivity is a common problem of metal oxides, so this phenomenon can be observed not only in MnO2, but also in the commonly used ones like V2O5, Fe2O3, and Fe3O4. Therefore, we believe that the premise of characterizing the cyclic stability of pseudocapacitive metal oxides is to ensure that the current density/scanning rate used can basically cause the redox reaction of all electrode material. As is known to all, metal oxide as a kind of pseudocapacitive material is one of the prerequisites of the metal elements that must have more than one valence (i.e., the redox reaction can happen) then for more valence metal elements (such as V, Mn, Fe, and so on), will appear different potential window, change of valence state in the process of reaction (i.e., product) is not the same as this will lead to cycle on the stability difference for this. We also made a summary of the situation of oxides, as shown in Table 5.

3.4 Metal hydroxides
Metal hydroxide is an ionic compound composed of positively charged metal ions and negatively charged hydroxide ions. The electrostatic interaction makes the metal positive ion and hydroxide negative ion form a firm ionic bond. The s orbital of metal hydroxides is usually saturated, so most metal hydroxides have good thermal and chemical stability. However, their d orbitals may be unsaturated, thus endowing them with some unique properties that make them have great application potential in the field of electronic devices.166,167 These unique properties include a wide energy bandgap,70,168 a high dielectric constant,164,169,170 a reactive electron transition capability,66,171 good electricity,65,172 and superconductivity.173,174 It is based on these excellent characteristics that the metal hydroxide has good cyclic stability, most of which belongs to Type II and Type III. For example, the cyclic stability of a small part of Ni–Mn LDHs and Ni–Al LDHs belongs to Type II, and the cyclic stability of some other materials such as nickel hydroxide (Ni(OH)2),168,175 nickel cobalt hydroxide (Ni–Co(OH)2)176–178 and magnesium nickel hydroxide (Mg–Ni(OH)2)179etc. belongs to Type III. The classification of metal hydroxides is shown in Fig. 10.

The typical example of metal hydroxide used in supercapacitors is LDHs, as shown in Table 6. LDHs are an anionic intercalating material with a large specific surface area that can be synthesized according to specific functional requirements. The basic structural formula is:[M1−x2+Mx3+(OH)2]x+Ax/nn−·mH2O

Among them, M2+ is the divalent metal (Fe2+, Mn2+, Zn2+, Mg2+, Co2+, Ni2+etc.) on the main plate layer, M3+ is the trivalent metal (Al3+, Co3+, Mn3+, Fe3+, Cr3+etc.) on the plate layer, An− is an interlayer anion (Cl−, NO3−, OH−, SO42−etc.), x is the mass ratio of M2+/(M2++M3+), and its value is generally about 0.16–0.33, and m represents the number of moles of crystalline water per mole of LDHs.180–182 In the structure of LDHs, trivalent cations (M3+) replace part of divalent cations (M2+) to increase the positive charge. Therefore, it is necessary to introduce anions into the structural unit to maintain a balance with the positive charge to maintain the stability of the crystal structure. This makes LDHs have a variety of unique physical and chemical properties, including electricity, the appearance memory effect of structural layers, and the exchange of ions between layers.183–187 Due to the high oxidation state of metal cations, this kind of layered material has good conductivity, which is conducive to the rapid transmission of electrons and electrolyte ions. With the appropriate synthesis method, LDHs can achieve a relatively high specific capacity and long-term cyclic stability of more than 10000 cycles.188,189 For example, Ni–Al LDHs, which capacitance retention can reach 91.9% (initial specific capacitance ∼2200 F g−1) after 100000 cycles in 2 M KOH electrolyte, at 5 A g−1 and (0–0.5) V.174
Other metal hydroxides, take Ni(OH)2 for example, in the case of similar test conditions such as electrolyte and potential window, Ni(OH)2 shows good cyclic stability at high current density (32 A g−1), and it could still reach 96% after 10000 cycles. But at low current density (5 A g−1), it is only 53% after 2000 cycles.168,175 Although metal hydroxides show good cyclic stability, the parameter setting in the cyclic stability test still has an important influence on the cyclic stability of metal hydroxides. The specific capacitance of two materials of Co–Fe LDHs at 1 A g−1 is 728 F g−1 (ref. 190) and 145 F g−1,191 respectively, and the different capacitances of them may be greatly related to the selection of potential window. The former has a capacitance retention rate of 84% after 5000 cycles at 2 A g−1, while the latter has a capacitance retention rate of 110% after 100 cycles at 10 A g−1 as shown in Fig. 11. It is worth mentioning that some metal oxides and metal hydroxides are also used as electrode materials for battery-type supercapacitors, among which nanometer nickel and cobalt base materials are typical electrode materials for battery-type supercapacitors. The materials that exhibit phase change behavior during electrochemical charging and discharging belong to battery type materials. Compared with pseudocapacitive materials, electrochemical reactions of battery-type materials are controlled by electrolyte ion diffusion, and phase change ion embedding and/or alloying reactions usually occur. Battery-type materials usually have high charging and discharging capacity, but due to the slow phase change kinetics during charging and discharging, their rate performance is low, and the cyclic stability is not ideal at low current density/scanning rate.11,192

3.5 Conductive polymers
As another important pseudocapacitive electrode material, conductive polymer is a kind of synthetic polymer with long chain conjugated structure. Its conductivity is between semiconductor and metal, even comparable to metal. Therefore, conductive polymers have been widely used in supercapacitor electrode materials in recent years. However, conductive polymer electrode materials are prone to structural collapse during the cycle test, so its cyclic stability generally belongs to Type III. According to the conductive mechanism, conductive polymers can be divided into three categories: electron conductive polymers (e.g. polyaniline, polypyrrole, polythiophene etc.), ionic conductive polymers (poly(4-vinyl pyridine)) and redox conductive polymers (e.g. polyethylene ferrocene, poly(o-phenylenediamine))35,201–206 (Fig. 12). The mechanism of conductive polymer is that rapid and reversible p-type or n-type element doping and de-doping redox reactions occur in the polymer; the p-type doping of the conductive polymer is the loss of electrons in its main chain accompanied by the embedding of anions, while the n-type doping is the gain of electrons in its main chain accompanied by the embedding of cations.68,207 So that conductive polymer achieves a high charge storage density, generates a high Faraday quasi capacitor and achieves electric energy storage.

The current density/scanning rate plays an important role in the electrochemical performance measurement of conductive polymer electrode materials. As the scanning rate increases, the specific capacitance value decreases and the capacitance retention rate increases. At the high scanning rate, due to the diffusion effect of ions in the electrode, some active sites cannot complete the redox transition. The decrease of capacitance indicates that part of electrode surface cannot be contacted under high charging and discharging rate, which shows the illusion of increasing capacitance retention rate. Therefore, the specific capacitance obtained at a slower scanning rate is considered to be close to these obtained when the electrode material is fully utilized, and the capacitance retention rate obtained at this time has higher comparability.
Dual et al. studied that the capacitance retention rate of PPy was 85% at 100 mV s−1 after 5000 cycles, and the rate capability reached 72.9% at 50 mV s−1 (ref. 208) (Fig. 13a and b). Yuan et al. found that the capacitance retention rate of PPy was 96.3% at 10 mV s−1 after 1000 cycles, and the rate capability was 51% at 100 mV s−1 (ref. 209) (Fig. 13c and d). From the aspect of test parameter setting, if the former can give such cyclic performance within 50 mV s−1 or also show the rate capability of the material at 100 mV s−1, then the result will be better. Fu et al.210 tested the cycling performance of PPy, in 1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte, the specific capacitance was 449.8 F g−1 at 1 A g−1, the rate performance was 66.7% at 20 A g−1, and the capacitance retention rate was 50.9% at 10 A g−1 after 10000 cycles.

The applied potential has a significant effect on the conductivity of the conductive polymer. The increase of applied potential is beneficial to the deep doping of the polymer, thus improving the conductivity of the conducting polymer. However, when the applied potential is too high, it will lead to the degradation and over oxidation of the conductive polymer chain, resulting in the decrease of its conductivity. Therefore, each conductive polymer has a potential threshold for its highest conductivity. Charging a conducting polymer beyond the upper limit of its potential window may permanently impair the electrochemical activity of the conducting polymer. This process is called peroxidation. The mechanism of peroxidation and its effect on the structure–conductivity relationship are complex and related to polymers. However, the ultimate result of the peroxide reaction is to reduce the conductivity of the conducting polymer, making it an electrochemical inert substance.211,212 The cyclic stability of different conductive polymers as shown in Table 7.

3.6 Carbon materials
Carbon materials have been widely used in supercapacitors due to their characteristics of light weight, abundant pore structure, good chemical stability and low manufacturing cost. Common carbon materials used in EDLCs include: active carbon, graphene, and carbon nanotubes etc.224–230 (Fig. 14). Carbon materials used in supercapacitor mainly follow the working principle of EDLCs: the surface charge of the electrode and the ions in the electrolyte are absorbed to its surface through electrostatic interaction, and an interface layer is formed between the electrode and the electrolyte which is equivalent and opposite electrical properties to the surface charge of the electrode. When an electric field is applied to both ends of the supercapacitor, the anions and cations in the electrolyte move to the positive and negative poles respectively, forming the potential difference. The result is a double layer. When the electric field is withdrawn, the double layer is stable because the charge on the electrode attracts the opposite charge in the electrolyte. After connecting the two poles of the supercapacitor, the charge on the electrode moves at the left and right side of the potential, generating current in the outer circuit, and the electrolyte becomes electrically neutral again. Both of them belong to the working principle of the EDLCs,231–233 and type I cyclic model.

According to the statistical data in the Table 8 (of course, the large number of reference materials we provide is not meant to be comprehensive). No matter the current density/scanning rate is large or small, the cyclic stability of carbon materials is very good, which related to the energy storage mechanism of carbon materials for double layer capacitance. Compared with pseudocapacitor electrode materials that store charges through electrochemically active material adsorption/desorption or electrochemical redox reaction, the current density/scanning rate has a smaller effect on the cycle stability of carbon materials. However, the standardized testing of cycle stability in carbon materials still cannot be ignored.

3.7 Other electrode materials
In addition to the several electrode materials described above, there are more and more researches on the use of metal sulfides, phosphides and selenides as electrode materials for supercapacitors. Metal sulfides mainly include cobalt sulfides (CoSx),247 nickel sulfides (Ni3S2),248 ternary nickel cobalt sulfide (NiCo2S4)249etc. Metal selenides include cobalt–selenium compounds (CoSe/CoSe2),250,251 copper–cobalt–selenium compounds (CuCoSe4),252 nickel–cobalt–selenium compounds (H–Ni–Co–Se)253 and nickel–selenium compounds (NiSe2/Ni3Se2)254,255etc. Metal phosphides mainly include nickel–phosphorus compounds (Ni2P),256 nickel–cobalt–phosphorus compounds (Ni–Co–P),257 sulfur-doped cobalt–phosphorus compounds (Co(P, S))258 and cobalt–phosphorus compounds (CoP)258etc. Among these materials, most of the cyclic stability curves belong to Type II and Type III. Similarly, the cyclic stability of metal sulfide, metal selenide, and metal phosphide electrode materials with pseudocapacitive behavior is also affected by the parameter settings during the test, as shown in Table 9. Herein, metal sulfides, metal phosphides and metal selenides will not be discussed in detail. Some comprehensive reviews about other electrode materials can be found in the literature.21,188

The electrodes contain powder electrodes and self-supporting electrodes according to those structure types, and most of the electrodes described above belong to powder electrodes. Unlike powder electrodes, self-supporting electrodes optimize the structural stability of materials by constructing their own structures, and then improve the capacity and cyclic stability of electrodes and other electrochemical properties.259–263 The structure of the self-supporting electrodes comprises: one-dimensional (1D) nanoarrays (such as nanowires,264 nanofibers,265 and nanotubes266,267), two-dimensional (2D) nanoarrays (such as holey nanosheets,268 nanowalls, and nanoflakes), three-dimensional (3D) nanoporous architectures on conductive substrates, self-supported yolk–shell nanocolloids, self-supported hierarchical core/shell, and urchin-like structure.269–274 And self-supporting electrodes show excellent electrochemical performance due to its unique structure can promote electrons transport and ions diffusion, and maintain the stability of the material structure.
4. Improvement strategies of cyclic stability
As a key aspect to evaluate the performance of supercapacitors, cyclic stability has been focused on in the recent decades. There are many factors that affect the cycle life of supercapacitors. On this basis, many researchers are committed to improving the cyclic stability of electrode materials by controlling the microstructure of the material, changing the composition of the material, and preparing composite materials. This section will review the main strategies for improving the cyclic stability of electrode materials from the following five aspects: microstructure and morphology, suitable electrolyte, surface coating, introduction of impurity particles and preparation of composite materials.
4.1 Microstructure and morphology
The microstructure and morphology of the electrode material are very important for its cyclic stability, because they directly determine the adsorption of electrolyte ions in the electrode material (mainly for electric double layer supercapacitors) and diffusion (mainly for pseudocapacitive supercapacitors). In general, novel microstructure and morphology could provide productive conditions beneficial to improving fast electrochemical process, such as high specific surface area, optimizing pore size distribution, and so on.

4.1.1 Micro morphology. 
There is abundant works reported that cyclic stability of supercapacitors has been enhanced through constructing unique microscopic morphologies of the electrochemical active electrode material, such as spherical nanoparticles, hollow structures, porous structures, layered structures, nanowires/rods/sheets, and so on. Our research group also used hydrothermal method, in situ auto-deposition method, phase inversion and phase separation method to construct mesoporous carbon,275 hierarchical porous carbon,225,276–278 interconnected hollow carbon,279,280 porous carbon nanofiber281,282 and biomass porous carbon226,283etc. These structures can not only ensure the original good cyclic stability of the carbon material, but also greatly improve the other electrochemical properties of the electrode material. Nanomaterials with different morphologies are always distributed in 0–3 dimensions. Based on these different microscopic morphologies, researchers focused on synthesize nanomaterials with small size and large specific surface area.
As the electrode material of supercapacitors, LDHs are mainly based on their special layered structure and pore structure, which can provide large specific surface area and a large number of reaction sites required by supercapacitors.195,196,284 They have the following advantages: the layered structure and larger specific surface area can greatly increase the double-layer capacitance; the redox reaction of transition metal elements can provide Faraday pseudocapacitance, that is, when LDHs are used for storage of supercapacitors, they can be used for both double layer capacitors and Faraday pseudocapacitors. At the same time, the interlayer anions bring abundant options for the modification and compounding of LDHs.26,163,193,285,286 Shao et al.30 studied several kinds of Ni–Al LDHs with different structures. Using constant current charging/discharging technology, these Ni–Al LDHs of different structures were tested for 1000 cycles with a current density of 8 A g−1 in a potential window of 0.1 to 0.5 V. The sequence order of cycling life of the different morphologies can be summarized as: hollow > yolk–shell > core–shell > LDH nanoparticles (Fig. 15a–d) mainly due to the different specific surface area and impedance. The improvement of the specific capacitance and specific rate capability of the hollow LDH microspheres is mainly due to their special nanostructures with large surface areas, which provide effective diffusion channels for electrolyte ions (OH−). In particular, the abundant mesopores in the structure can be used as an ion pool, which can ensure a stable supply of OH− and a high current density for the energy storage vector reaction. The hollow structure has a lower resistance and therefore allows faster electron transport.

Birnessite-type MnO2 nanoparticles, which have a mesoporous structure (narrow pore size distribution around 3.88 nm) that may be beneficial for ionic transportation through the electrolyte and improve the electrochemical performance and the specific capacitance retention was 92% after 1000 cycles at 2 A g−1 (ref. 138) (Fig. 15e and i). One-dimensional (1 D) MoO2 nanorods were synthesized by thermal decomposition of tetrabutylammonium hexamolybdate in N2 atmosphere and exhibited high specific capacitance and good reversibility with cyclic efficiency of 86% after 50 cycles, which can be attributed to the unique electrochemical properties of 1 D nanorods. The ability of MoO2 to exhibit capacitive behaviour in the negative potential region makes the material a possible negative electrode for asymmetric hybrid electrochemical capacitors146 (Fig. 15f and j). Xiao et al.38 reported a scalable method that uses reduction of 2 D hexagonal oxides in ammonia to produce 2 D nitrides, such as MoN, W2N and V2N. Both theoretical calculations and experiments have proved the metallic properties of 2 D nitrides, in which N atoms occupy the triangular prism positions between the Mo layers. In addition, no band gap is found in MoN nanosheets, and the high electron density of states (DOS) of the Fermi level reveals its metallic properties. The results show that a larger part of the DOS of the Fermi level is mainly distributed by the d electrons of Mo atoms, which leads to the high conductivity of 2 D MoN. The hydrophilic stacked 2 D MoN film shows high volume capacitance of 928 F cm−3 in a sulfuric acid electrolyte, with excellent rate performance. After 25000 cycles, the capacitance retention rate reaches 95% when the scanning rate is 100 mV s−1 (Fig. 15g and k). Solvothermal synthesis of 3 D layered Co3O4 double sphere material with sea urchin-like structure has excellent electrochemical performance. The 3 D layered Co3O4 double sphere can not only provide a 3 D network for electron transmission, but also provide spaces that are critical to ion diffusion, which dominate the energy storage performance of supercapacitors. After 1000 cycles at a current density of 4 A g−1, these devices also have high charging and discharging reversibility, with an efficiency of 97.8%119 (Fig. 15h and l).
As important as the microstructure, the morphology of the material largely determines its electrochemical performance, including cycle life. Studies have shown that among many electrode materials of supercapacitors, porous materials have broad prospects. Xi et al.48 prepared metallic porous MoN, TiN, and Ta5N6 single crystals, which atomically terminate with Mo, Ti and Ta atom layer, respectively, with nitrogen atom layer stacking beneath the surface metal atom layer. Porous MoN, Ta5N6, and TiN showed excellent cyclic stability both in acidic and alkaline electrolyte. Porous TiN, at 50 mV s−1, in 1 M KOH and 0.5 M H2SO4, after 60000 and 10000 cycles, capacitance retention is still close to 100%. The long-distance ordering of the active metal nitrogen sites illustrates the rapid redox reaction in chemical adsorption, while the high conductivity and porous microstructure promote charge transfer and material diffusion in the electrode. It is precisely because nanoporous structure can effectively improve the reaction kinetics of the electrode, thereby improving its electrochemical performance and long-term periodicity. Furthermore, nanomaterials can shorten the transport path of electrolyte ions, provide greater ion adsorption capacity, and ensure that the electrolyte quickly enters the redox active site, thereby improving the reaction kinetics, thereby improving the cyclic stability of the electrode material. In addition, the unique spatial structure of 2 D and 3 D nanomaterials provides a more convenient channel for electrolyte transportation, insertion and release, thereby helping to enhance the material's false capacitance.


4.1.2 Crystal structure. 
The crystal structure is the microstructure of the crystal, which is the specific arrangement of the actual particles (atoms, ions or molecules) in the crystal. Solid metals and alloys are mostly crystals. Crystal structure is one of the basic factors that determine the physical, chemical, and mechanical properties of solid metals. Therefore, the cyclic stability of the electrode material can be improved by adjusting the crystal structure of the electrode material.
MnO2 has a variety of crystal structures (Fig. 16a–e), so they have tunnels or intermediate layers with gaps of different sizes. The capacitance characteristics of MnO2 electrode materials are due to the intercalation/deintercalation of protons or cations in MnO2. Therefore, only some crystal structures with sufficient gaps to accommodate these ions can exhibit excellent cyclic stability (Fig. 16f). The narrow tunnel in β-MnO2 makes it unsuitable for capacitor applications because it cannot accommodate cations during charging–discharging cycles, so there is almost no specific capacitance. Even though its cyclic stability is good, it is meaningless. Although the cyclic stability of α-MnO2, δ-MnO2 has decreased, the specific capacitance is relatively large. This is due to their large interlayer spacing and large tunnel size, which makes them very potential supercapacitors electrode materials. In addition to MnO2, the design of porous single crystals of metal nitrides can also effectively improve the cyclic stability of the material. For example, MoN porous single crystal has excellent cyclic stability in alkaline electrolyte. In 1 M KOH, at 50 mV s−1, the capacitance retention rate is almost not attenuated, still close to 100% after 10000 cycles (Fig. 16g–i).

4.1.3 Molecular structure. 
The structure of solid molecules can be determined by X-ray crystallography. Molecular structure relates to the position of atoms in space and is related to the types of chemical bonds, including bond length, bond angle, and the dihedral angle between three adjacent bonds. The molecular structure largely affects the reactivity, polarity, phase state, color and biological activity of the substance. Therefore, the cyclic stability of the material can be improved by changing the molecular structure of the material.
The structure of conductive polymer electrode materials is easily destroyed during the cycle test, which makes their cyclic stability poor. This is because the volume of the conductive polymer expands and destroys their original molecular chain structure. Therefore, the cyclic stability of the material can be improved by strengthening the molecular chain of the conductive polymer or increasing the space between the molecular chain layers. For example, combining 1 D delocalized conjugated structure PPy with a large molecular size SDBS, an ordered structure of PPy-SDBS is obtained, which has excellent cyclic stability with capacitance retention of ∼84.8% after 200000 cycles, which due to the large molecule size of SDBS can strongly bond with PPy chain and increase the space between PPy chain layers289 (Fig. 17a–d).

In addition to compounding with other materials to optimize the molecular chain structure, the molecular structure can also be optimized by changing the preparation method of the material. For example, Huang et al.288 used electro-polymerization and chemical polymerization methods to prepare PPy with different molecular structures. Compared with the changes in the structure of electro-polymerization PPy (e-PPy) and chemical polymerization (c-PPy) before and after the cycle test, they found that the structure of e-PPy was better than that of c-PPy. It is stable because the ordered structure of e-PPy (Fig. 17e and f) facilitates the uniform distribution of stress in the molecular chain matrix during charge and discharge cycles, thereby significantly improving cyclic stability. On the contrary, disordered c-PPy (Fig. 17g and h) inhibits ion diffusion and uniform stress distribution, leading to structural collapse and poor cyclic stability (as shown in Fig. 17i).

4.2 Encapsulation by coating different materials

4.2.1 Encapsulation by carbon. 
As we all know, the irreversible oxidation reaction of nitrides electrode in the electrolyte is a major factor affecting its long periodicity. Therefore, it is an effective method to use carbon materials, which have excellent cyclic stability, to surface encapsulate nitrides with high specific capacitance to protect their inherent structure. The most typical is to use the method of hydrothermal combined with high temperature sintering to coat the sugar-derived carbon layer on the surface of the nitride to obtain TiN@C and VN@C materials (Fig. 18a–d).97 By testing its cyclic stability, it can be found that compared with pure nitride (the specific capacitance retained only 8.5% and 9.1% after 15000 cycles), the nitrides after carbon encapsulation show excellent long periodicity (the specific capacitance retained 88.4% and 91.7% after 15000 cycles). In this work, the author believes that the nitrogen-doped carbon coating may also be another reason for increasing the capacitance of the material. Therefore, we used PANI as a carbon source to prepare nitrogen-doped carbon encapsulated iron nitride nanoparticles (Fe2NNP/NC), and the Fe2NNP/NC (after 5000 times charging and discharging test can still keep about 70% of the initial capacitance) exhibits more excellent cyclic stability compared to bare iron nitride (after 2000 times charging and discharging capacitance has dropped to below 60% of the initial value) (Fig. 18e and f).290

The volume change caused by the insertion/extraction of ions during the charge storage process of the conductive polymer seriously hinders its long-term use. Therefore, the strategy of carbon layer coating has also been studied in solving the poor cyclic stability of conductive polymers. In the work of Liu et al., the cyclic stability of PANI and PPy nanowire (NW) pseudocapacitor electrodes were improved by depositing a thin carbon shell on the polymer. In 1 M H2SO4 electrolyte, the carbon shell maintains the structure of PANI and PPy during long-term circulation. The carbon film-coated PANI and PPy electrodes showed 95% and 85% capacitance retention after 10000 cycles. On the contrary, after 10000 cycles of PANI and PPy without carbon coating, the capacitance retention rate is around 20% (Fig. 18g–i).291


4.2.2 Others coatings. 
In addition to using the coating to protect the body structure of the materials to improve their cyclic stability, the method of coating and encapsulation also has a main reason that the synergy between the two materials will also contribute to the ultra-long cyclic stability. Utilizing the synergy between V2O5 and PPy, a V2O5@PPy composite material with excellent cyclic stability can be obtained. After 2000 cycles, the capacitance is only attenuated by 17.5% (Fig. 19a–c).292 In our recent report, VN@VO2 is prepared by coating a single oxide layer (VO2) on the surface of VN, which has a capacitance retention rate of 85% after 1000 cycles of charge and discharge tests at a current density of 1 A g−1 (Fig. 19d and e).293 It is worth noting that, compared with the previous work where the capacitance retention rate was less than 60% at 600 cycles; it is very satisfactory to be able to obtain such results at low current density.

4.3 Introducing “impurity atoms, ions, or nanoparticles”
From sorting out the existing literature, it can be found that in addition to regulating the microstructure and morphology, the improvement of the cyclic stability of electrode materials can also be achieved by introducing “impurity atoms, ions, or nanoparticles”. The impact of the existence of these impurity materials on the cyclic stability is mainly contributed by the followings. (i) The presence of impurity materials can cause structural deformation of the bulk material and/or changes in charge density. (ii) Impurity materials are similar to “catalysts” in the electrode reaction process, which can effectively speed up the electrode reaction process and reduce the dissolution of electrode materials in the electrolyte, thereby improving the cyclic stability. Therefore, this part mainly discusses the improvement of the cyclic stability of electrode materials through introducing impurity atoms, ions, or nanoparticles.

4.3.1 Atoms or ions. 
The doping of heteroatoms, especially in carbon materials, has been a research hotspot in the field of carbon materials in recent years. Including monoatomic doping, diatomic doping, triatomic doping, etc. Such atoms introduced by doping will cause structural deformation and/or charge density changes of the original materials, and even replace some atoms in the initial materials. In addition to atoms, the doping of ions can also be of great help to the long cycle life of incipient materials. Yang et al.294 synthesized three-dimensional hierarchical porous carbon material co-doped with phosphorus and oxygen (labeled as P-3DHPCs) through in situ template method. Compared with undoped carbon materials (Fig. 20a), the specific capacitance of carbon materials is greatly improved by the co-doping of phosphorus and oxygen, which indicates that the pseudocapacitance introduced by the impurity doping greatly improves the energy storage capacity of carbon materials. When the current density was 3 A g−1, the capacitance retention rate of the P-3DHPC-0.2 sample was as high as 96.5% even after 10000 cycles (Fig. 20b). The excellent cycling performance is attributed to the synergistic effect of the fractional pore structure and the co-doping of phosphorus and oxygen: the mesoporous structure not only provides an effective ion adsorption storage site, but also facilitates the electrolyte ion penetration and rapid transmission. The macroporous structure serves as a bridge between the electrolyte and the internal channel of the material. Phosphorus-oxygen co-doping is helpful to introduce pseudocapacitance and abundant phosphorus–oxygen functional groups can also improve the wettability of carbon materials to electrolyte. The perfect combination of porous structure and heteroatom doping makes the electrode material exhibit excellent electrochemical performance. For instance, introducing nitrogen atoms into the carbon skeleton can significantly improve the specific capacitance of carbon-based materials due to nitrogen atoms can not only provide high specific capacity of pseudocapacitance, but also improve the conductivity and wettability of electrode materials, so that the electrode materials have good cyclic stability and excellent rate performance.297,298 Furthermore, nitrogen atoms have outer lone pair electrons, which can increase the electronegativity and wettability of the bulk material. Therefore, nitrogen-doped carbon systems can promote the rapid migration of ions in the pores on the surface of the carbon materials, which is conducive to improving the capacitive performance of the carbon materials.299

Compared with the good cyclic stability of carbon materials, conductive polymer based electrode materials are prone to collapse due to the rapid expansion and contraction of material volume during charging and discharging, resulting in poor cyclic stability.67,300 Therefore, research work is mainly focused on improving the discharging performance, cycle life and thermal stability of polymer electrodes, and looking for conductive polymers with excellent doping properties.300–304 To change a conductive polymer from an insulating state to a conducting state requires the removal of electrons from its molecular chain, a process called doping. Doping and de-doping of conductive polymers are equivalent to electrochemical oxidation and reduction. Doping is the removal of electrons from the top of the conductive polymer band (HOMO), and the oxidation reaction forms p-type doping. Or the bottom of the conduction band (LUMO) is injected with electrons, and the reduction reaction forms an n-type doping. The proposed mechanisms include charge transfer complexation and protic acid. Dopant or electron acceptor or electron donor, a wide variety of electron acceptors, mainly Li, Na, K etc.; electron donors include halogens, Lewis acids and protic acids, transition metal salts and so on. Take PPy as an example, the cyclic stability of PPy is very frustrating, which is limited by structural failures caused by repeated reverse ion flow during charging and discharging.202,305 On the one hand, as a p-type conductive polymer, the undoped neutral nitrogen groups in the PPy attract opposite anions from the electrolyte during charging, leading to expansion. In a reverse discharging, the positively charged nitrogen group becomes neutral, repelling the counter ions into the electrolyte and causing shrinkage. Structural damage due to this repeated volume expansion/contraction will inevitably result in capacitance loss.
Chen et al.295 used thorium zirconium reagent as anion dopant and deposited PPy film on foam Ni by electro-polymerization. The use of foam Ni can prevent the polymer from expanding during the cycle. Thorium zirconium reagent is both an anionic dopant and can ensure the good contact between foam Ni and PPy, so as to achieve the PPy electrode with high conductivity, high capacitance and good cyclic stability. After 1000 cycles, the capacitance retention rate of PPy can reach 91.5% (Fig. 20c). Shi et al.296 used titanium as a chelating anion dopant to attach the PPy film to the nickel substrate by electrodeposition. Compared with other aromatic sulfonate dopants, tiron has higher charge-mass ratio and chelating properties, which is conducive to the effective transfer of charge and the preparation of adhesion membrane in the electro-polymerization process. In addition, under high scanning rate, the use of nickel substrate can significantly improve the poor cyclic stability of PPy film. After 1000 cycles, PPy has a capacitance retention rate of 93.1% (Fig. 20d). The only regret is that the cyclic stability was tested at high sweep speeds.


4.3.2 Nanoparticles or quantum dots. 
Nanoparticles or quantum dots have high electrical conductivity, high surface activity, and catalytic capability. At present, there are many types of nanoparticles or quantum dots used in supercapacitor electrode materials, including carbon quantum dots, metal, and metal compounds quantum dots or nanoparticles. The introduction of nanoparticles can improve the cyclic stability of various electrode materials. For example, introducing gold nanoparticles into conductive polymers and metal oxides can provide necessary electron transport channels for electrolyte ions during charging and discharging, thereby improving the cyclic stability of electrode materials.306–308 Our group used a variety of methods to prepare metal nitride into quantum dots dispersed on a variety of structural carbon materials (such as porous carbon, hierarchical interlinked porous carbon, microporous carbon and hollow carbon, etc.), which can effectively improve the dissolution of electrode materials and cyclic stability of electrode materials.309–314
Gold nanoparticles could be controlled and has high electric conductivity. In our previous report, we introduced gold nanoparticles into nano-Co3O4 bulk (AuNP/nano-Co3O4) would contribute to reduce internal resistance of charge transmission (Fig. 21a and b). The gold nanoparticles decorated nano-Co3O4 exhibits higher specific capacitance (681 F g−1) than that of pristine Co3O4 (368 F g−1), and the retention of AuNP/nano-Co3O4 and nano-Co3O4 was 83.1% and 79.8% after 13000 cycles, respectively (Fig. 21c). This is due to the introduction of Au nanoparticles improved the conductivity of the electrode material and shortened the diffusion length of the charges during charging and discharging process, further enhanced the cyclic stability.315 In addition, gold nanoparticles can also be doped in PANI to improve the electrochemical properties of the electrode materials (Fig. 21d–g).316 After 2000 cycles, the original PANI only retained 38.5% of the initial specific capacitance, while nano-Au@PANI-12 retained 58.9% of the specific capacitance. Pseudocapacitive materials are difficult to have excellent cyclic stability due to slow reaction kinetics and lower ion transmission speed than electron transmission speed. The existence of nano-Au just provides the necessary electron transport channel during the charging/discharging process. Therefore, both the metal oxide and the conductive polymer after introducing gold nanoparticles exhibit excellent cyclic stability compared to their pure substances.

4.4 Preparation of composite materials
As another important electrode material for supercapacitors, some metal oxides/hydroxides have higher theoretical capacitance, but due to poor conductivity, the actual specific capacitance of this material is much lower than its theoretical value. Although some metal oxides have good conductivity, but their theoretical capacitance is not enough to further increase the capacitance of the material. In addition, some metal oxides tend to form multiple nanostructures on a high specific surface, while others tend to form bulk materials with high crystallinity. Therefore, combining two metal oxides to prepare composite nanostructures to improve capacitance performance has become a new research direction in the field of supercapacitors in recent years, and has become a research hotspot.317,318 The most typical binary oxide-based electrode materials are nickel, cobalt, and manganese-based binary oxides, and other types of binary oxide-based electrode materials have also been reported. According to reports, inserting cobalt compounds into nickel oxide (nickel hydroxide) can improve the electronic conductivity of the material. The combination of nickel and cobalt oxide (cobalt hydroxide) improves the electrochemically active sites of the material.285 NiCo2O4 (NCO) is considered as a promising hybrid supercapacitor electrode material due to its advantages of good electron conductivity, low diffusion resistance to protons/ions and easy electrolyte penetration. These excellent characteristics are conducive to the development of high-performance electrode materials. However, cyclic stability and multiplier properties have always been shortcomings of NCO electrode materials, and many researchers have been working to improve these defects in binary transition metal oxide NCO. Zhang et al.319 reported that mesoporous NCO nanowires grown on carbon fiber fabrics exhibited high capacitance, good cyclic stability and excellent multiplier performance as binder flexible electrodes of supercapacitors.
It is well known that nano-sheet aggregation and stacking are common problems in the self-assembly process of two-dimensional materials, which will reduce the layer spacing and lead to decreased access of electrolyte ions to electrodes. This is not conducive to the rapid transfer of electrolyte ions in the charging and discharging process and affects the full play of its two-dimensional structure's contribution to electrochemical performance.320–324 In order to avoid the accumulation of nano-flakes, the structure of MXenes needs to be designed and regulated. Three-dimensional pores are formed in MXenes to synthesize 2 D + 3 D three-dimensional porous structures.24,325 It can not only effectively avoid the accumulation of MXenes nanocrystals, but also increase the number of active sites on the surface and enhance the electrochemical performance of electrode materials to varying degrees. As an effective method to regulate MXenes structure, composite with pseudocapacitance materials can give play to the synergistic effect between the two and enhance the electrochemical performance.326–328
At present, successful composite materials include oxides, hydroxides and polymers.332,333 For example, the LDH/MXenens composite material with Ni–Al layered double hydroxides (LDH) grown in situ on the surface of Ti3C2Tx can reach 1061 F g−1 with a current density of 1 A g−1 and maintain 70% of the initial value after 4000 cycles of charging and discharging329 (Fig. 22a–c). By introducing the conductive polymer into MXenes structure, the electrode materials of supercapacitors with excellent properties can be prepared. Zhu et al.330 synthesized a flexible thin film electrode by in situ polymerization of PPy on the surface of Ti3C2Tx particles, with a surface capacitance up to 203 mF cm−2, 30% higher than that of pure PPy, and basically no attenuation after 20000 cycles of charging and discharging (Fig. 22d–f). Boota et al.331 prepared high-performance PPy/Ti3C2Tx composite materials with volume specific capacitance up to 1000 F cm−3 by in situ polymerization of polypyrrole in Ti3C2Tx film. PPy between Ti3C2Tx layers not only increases the Ti3C2Tx layer spacing, but also provides additional redox reactions and enhances the electrochemical properties of the material (Fig. 22g–i).

What needs to be emphasized is that regardless of the control of microstructure and morphology, doped heteroatoms/ions, introduced nanoparticles/quantum dots, coated carbon, and combined with other reinforcement to form composite materials. Or the cooperation between the above improvement methods can effectively improve the cyclic stability of electrode materials.
5. Cyclic stability of supercapacitors device
Although electrode materials for supercapacitors plays an irreplaceable role, in view of the level of practical application, the performance of the supercapacitors' device is the most important thing, especially the cycle stability. Therefore, in this part we will mainly discuss the basic components of supercapacitors' device and the research status of different device, including their cycle stability. In general, the supercapacitors can be divided into three categories: symmetrical type, asymmetric type and hybrid type supercapacitors72,73,334,335 (Fig. 23). Symmetrical supercapacitors (SSCs), using the same kind of electrode material as the positive and negative, is the most primitive type of supercapacitors. With the development of electrochemical industry, asymmetrical supercapacitors (ASCs) appeared gradually, and compared with SSCs, the ASCs have higher energy density.285 Moreover, in recent years, more and more scientists have developed a series of battery-supercapacitor hybrid devices (BSHs) by combining battery materials with high energy density and capacitive materials with high power density.

5.1 Basic components of supercapacitors device
As we all know, no matter what type of supercapacitors, its main components are electrode material, electrolyte and separator. And for supercapacitors, these components are indispensable. Only when these components cooperate with each other and actively play their important roles, the supercapacitors can better serve our production and life.

5.1.1 Electrode. 
In the above composition, the electrode material is nothing more than the most important, because only the existence of the electrode material can have charge storage. Similarly, in the previous discussion, we can also find that the electrode material directly determines the supercapacitors energy storage mechanism and electrochemical performance. The detailed discussion of electrode materials has been described separately in the previous paper (Section 3), which will not be repeated here. Here we only discuss the relationship between the electrode materials and the cycle stability of the supercapacitor device. As mentioned, supercapacitors can be divided into three categories. In these three types, the positive and negative poles of SSCs are the same. Therefore, the cyclic stability of the device depends on that of the electrode materials. While, the positive and negative electrode materials of asymmetric and hybrid supercapacitors are inconsistent. In this case, there will be a problem of positive and negative matching caused by the difference in charge storage capacity of different materials, which will greatly affect the cycle life of the corresponding device. Therefore, for the cycling stability of those devices, the matching of positive and negative electrodes is very important.


5.1.2 Electrolyte. 
Electrolyte is another important component of supercapacitors. The compatibility of electrolyte and electrode materials is the decisive factor for the working potential of supercapacitors. Therefore, the electrolyte has a great influence on the cyclic stability of for supercapacitors. The conductivity of the electrolyte is based on the directional electromigration of charged solvated ions in the electrolyte between two electrodes under the action of an electric field. Each electrolyte has its own advantages and disadvantages. The two main criteria for choosing an electrolyte are the electrochemical stability window and ionic conductivity. The properties of the electrolyte (such as ion type, concentration and operating temperature) affect the specific capacitance and cyclic stability of the supercapacitors. Supercapacitors electrolytes are mainly divided into water-based electrolytes, organic electrolytes, ionic electrolytes and solid/quasi-solid electrolytes.72,334–336
Aqueous electrolytes, mainly including acidic, alkaline, and neutral, can provide high ion concentration, low resistance, and high ion conductivity, are cheap and easy to post-process. However, due to the limitation of water decomposition potential (1.23 V), the working potential of the water system is relatively low (about 1 V). In addition, the operating temperature range of water-electrolyte supercapacitors is limited to above the freezing point. H2SO4 solution is the most typical representative of acidic aqueous solution with high conductivity. At 25 °C, the ionic conductivity of a 1 M H2SO4 solution is 0.8 S cm−1. Therefore, most studies use 1 M H2SO4 electrolyte solutions, especially EDLCs with carbon-based electrode materials. Most studies have found that the specific capacitance and cyclic stability of EDLCs obtained in H2SO4 electrolyte are higher than that of neutral electrolyte.337–339 Among various alkaline aqueous solutions, KOH is widely used due to its high ionic conductivity (0.6 S cm−1 at 25 °C for 6 M KOH). When using metal oxides, use a low-concentration KOH solution (such as 1 M), and when using carbon-based materials as electrode materials, a higher concentration (such as 6 M) is preferred.340,341 The use of neutral electrolytes in supercapacitors not only solves the corrosion problem, but also provides an effective and environmentally friendly way to increase the working potential, thereby increasing the energy density. When using 1 M Li2SO4 electrolyte, Fic et al.342 obtained a higher working potential of 2.2 V for symmetric EDLCs, and their EDLCs could circulate 15000 cycles without any significant capacitance attenuation. However, in order to further improve the energy density and cycle life, the performance of the neutral electrolyte needs to be further improved.
Compared with aqueous electrolyte, the complexation of some polymer functional groups with cations leads to the formation of polymer–cation complexes without adding any solvents. This kind electrolyte is called all solid polymer electrolyte (SPE).343 In addition to the several electrolytes described above, organic electrolytes can provide a wider potential window for the corresponding electrode materials. On the premise of not changing the material cyclic stability, a wider potential window means greater energy density and power density. Therefore, the influence of organic electrolytes on cyclic stability also has high research value. As shown in Table 10, electrolytes that match metal nitrides, metal carbides and carbon electrode materials are generally acidic and alkaline electrolytes such as H2SO4 and KOH. Among them, the potential window of the carbon electrode material in the electrolyte is −1 to 0 or 0 to 1. Electrolytes that match metal oxide electrode materials are generally neutral and alkaline electrolytes such as Na2SO4 and KOH. Electrolytes that match metal hydroxide electrode materials are generally alkaline electrolytes such as KOH. Electrolytes that match conductive polymer electrode materials are generally acidic electrolytes such as H2SO4. Electrolytes that match other electrode materials such as metal sulfides, metal selenides and metal phosphides are generally alkaline electrolytes such as KOH.

5.1.3 Separator. 
Separator is a porous film built in between two electrodes and the key component of the supercapacitors. As a cycle channel of electrolyte ions and separating positive and negative electrodes, its main functions are as follows: (i) isolate the positive and negative materials to prevent contact between the electrodes from causing short circuits. (ii) Conduct the electrolyte ion circulation channel to ensure the rapid progress of the charging and discharging process. At present, the commonly used supercapacitors separators mainly include separator paper,345,346 polypropylene ester type separator,347 electrostatic spinning separator,348 biological separator349,350 and synthetic polymer membrane,351–357etc. Of course, in order to meet the requirements of supercapacitors for these two aspects of performance, the process of preparing the separator needs to make the separator meet the following requirements: (i) good isolation performance and insulation effect. (ii) High porosity, the exchange of electrolyte ion in the supercapacitors the rate is mainly affected by the structure of the separator. (iii) Better liquid absorption and liquid retention performance. (iv) The separator material is chemically stable and does not react with the electrolyte. (v) The separator material has a low ionic resistance, and the produced supercapacitor has a low self-discharge rate. Smaller ions resistance can ensure that the electrons in the electrolyte pass through the separator efficiently, and improve the current density. (vi) High mechanical strength, small shrinkage and deformation. (vii) The surface of the separator material is flat, the pore distribution is uniform, and the porous structure is the key to ensuring the smooth passage of electrolyte ions through the separator.

5.2 Symmetrical supercapacitors (SSCs)
The symmetrical structure is the most traditional and basic structure of a supercapacitor. SSCs use the middle separator as the symmetry plane, the electrodes on both sides are exactly the same, and the electrical properties of the two plates are opposite during operation (Fig. 23a). Most all-solid supercapacitors, flexible and integrated supercapacitors are SSCs.358 At the beginning of the research, the electrode materials of SSCs were mostly electric double layer materials, which had good cyclic stability and low energy density. So far, quite a number of materials including various carbon materials,359–361 carbon materials/conductive polymers,43,361–366 carbon materials/metal oxides,367–381 carbon materials/metal sulfides,382 metal oxides/conductive polymers383–385 and metal organic framework (MOF) materials,386,387etc., have been used as substrates to construct supercapacitors. The potential window of SSCs is limited by the potential window of the electrode materials, which in turn limits its power density and energy density. In contrast, the potential window of asymmetric supercapacitors is the sum of the potential windows of the positive and negative electrodes. Therefore, the control of the potential window is more flexible, higher power density and energy density can be obtained. Therefore, researchers gradually focused their research on the development of asymmetric supercapacitors.
5.3 Asymmetric supercapacitors (ASCs)
Asymmetric supercapacitors are composed of two different capacitive electrode materials335,388 (Fig. 23b and c). Therefore, there are four combinations of positive and negative poles of ASCs: (i) the positive and negative electrodes are two different EDLCs materials; (ii) the positive electrode is a EDLCs material, and the negative electrode is a pseudocapacitance material; (iii) the positive electrode is a pseudocapacitance material, and the negative electrode is a EDLCs material; (iv) the positive and negative electrodes are two different pseudocapacitance materials.20 ASCs electrode materials include carbon material/metal oxide system,389–404 carbon material/metal hydroxide system,155,405,406 carbon material/metal carbide system,407,408 carbon material/metal sulfide system,409–412 carbon material/metal phosphide system,413 carbon material/conductive polymer system,414–416 metal compound/conductive polymer system417–419 and two dissimilar metal compound system,54,420–423etc. ASCs combine the advantages of EDLCs and pseudocapacitors, so they have high energy density, power density and long cycle life, which has become a research hotspot in the field of supercapacitors in recent years.424,425
5.4 Battery-supercapacitor hybrid devices (BSHs)
Whether EDLCs or pseudocapacitors, the energy storage process only occurs on the surface or near the surface of the electrode material; in contrast, battery materials store energy through a bulk oxidation-reduction process. In order to further increase the energy density of supercapacitors, people invented battery-supercapacitor hybrid devices (BSHs) (Fig. 23d), whose electrode materials consist of battery-type material and capacitive material.73,426 BSHs can be subdivided into Li ion BSHs,427–433 Na ion BSHs,402,404–440 K ion BSHs246,441–444 and Zn ion BSHs,445–454etc. BSHs combine the advantages of capacitors and batteries, which have high working voltage, large capacitance and high energy density. The charging and discharging speed, power density, internal resistance, cycle life and other properties of BSH are mainly determined by battery-type electrode materials.73,426,455 Therefore, composite electrode materials with high specific capacitance, high working voltage, high specific power and long cycle life have been developed to improve BSH Energy density and power density are the focus of current research.
5.5 Commercial supercapacitors
From small-capacity special energy storage to large-scale electric energy storage, from separate energy storage to hybrid energy storage combined with batteries or fuel cells, supercapacitors have demonstrated unique advantages. The United States, Europe, Japan, South Korea and other developed countries and regions have conducted fruitful research on the application of supercapacitors. From the research of SSCs to ASCs and BSHs, all of them are to gradually satisfy the practical application of supercapacitors.
Although there has been much research on the basis of different devices of supercapacitors, the application market for supercapacitors is still dominated by carbon based electric double layer capacitors. For instance, the commercial electric double layer type of supercapacitors produced by China's Ningbo CRRC New Energy Technology Co., LTD has an ultra-high specific capacitance of 12000 F and more than 106 charging and discharging cycles. However, although the commercialization of the electric double layer type supercapacitors has been relatively mature, the low energy density (∼10 W h kg−1)456 is still the key factor that limit its further application. In order to solve this problem, scientists set their sights on hybrid supercapacitors. It has high energy and power density and has considerable application prospects, and how its practical application needs to be further tracking. Recently, there have been reports on the industrialization of small batches.457 For example, Ningbo CRRC New Energy Technology Co., LTD. Production of hybrid supercapacitors can reach 66000 F high specific capacitance, and with 40 W h kg−1 of high energy density, and the cycle life can reach 3 × 104. Although the industrialization of hybrid ultracapacitors has just started, it has a broad application prospect in the practical application of electrochemical capacitors in the future, because its energy density can reach 3–4 times of that of double-layer capacitors and it has a higher power density than traditional batteries.
As a new type of green energy storage device, supercapacitors have now occupied a place in industrial production, and have grown with the development of new energy, electronic industry, mechanical equipment and other fields. In addition to continuing to make breakthroughs in key technologies (such as electrodes, electrolytes and diaphragm materials, etc.), expand production scale to achieve better scale efficiency, reduce use costs, gain in-depth understanding of the application requirements of different industries, and develop targeted Technical solutions are the focus of future market competition.
6. Conclusions and prospects
6.1 Conclusions
In conclusion, we mainly discussed the factors affecting the cyclic stability of electrode materials. And some methods to improve the cyclic stability are proposed. The conclusions are listed as follows:
(i) Cyclic stability of supercapacitors refers to the specific capacitance retention rate under standard and rational test conditions, after a certain working time or a certain number of charging–discharging cycles. According to the energy storage mechanism of various electrode materials, the types of cyclic stability of supercapacitors can be divided into three types. Type I: after numbers of cycles, the specific capacitance of the material is still close to the original one. The cyclic stability of most carbon materials with EDLCs behavior belongs to this type, because carbon materials realize charge storage through the reversible physical adsorption and desorption of ions on the electrode/electrolyte interface. Therefore, the capacitance hardly decays during long cycles. Type II: during the initial charging–discharging cycles, the material has self-activation. The specific capacitance has an obvious increase compared with the initial value, and the retention rate is always greater than 100%. After the stage of self-activation, the capacitance retention rate drops to the original capacitance value, or is far less than 100%. The representative materials are metal compounds with pseudocapacitive behavior and battery-type nickel-based and cobalt-based electrode materials. Type III: since the beginning of the test, the specific capacitance of electrode materials keeps decreasing continuously. The representative material is conductive polymer, and this is caused by the violent expansion and contraction of the material volume during the charging/discharging process which can easily lead to the collapse of the material structure.
(ii) Test condition has a very important influence on cyclic stability. When other test conditions are appropriate, the current density/scanning rate used to test the cyclic stability should be as close as possible to those in which get the maximum specific capacitance. During the cyclic stability test, the potential should be consistent with other electrochemical tests. In words, the standardized test of cyclic stability should be in appropriate condition like current density, scanning rate, and potential window.
(iii) The cyclic stability of electrode materials and supercapacitor device has high dependence on the stability of the electrode materials and the other device components. The types of the energy storage mechanism associated to the electrode materials are the key aspect. On the whole, the order of the cyclic stability according to the energy storage mechanism should be: psedusupercapacitance < intercalation type supercapacitors < electric double-layer capacitors.
(iv) By correctly assessing the energy storage type of materials, different methods can be used to improve their cycle stability. For example, constructing the microstructure and morphology, encapsulating by coating different materials, and introducing “impurity atoms, ions, or particles” into the materials.
6.2 Prospects
For practical applications, the electrochemical performance measurements for both electrode materials and supercapacitors should be under standardized condition including cycle stability. Only the data obtained under a unified standard can more easily be compared and considered for real usage. Based on the above issues, we believe that the following points can be developed in the future:
(i) In this review, we detailed described the stability of various electrode materials with different energy storage mechanism. Till now, the energy storage mechanism is still controversial and needs to be further explored with the help of the various advanced structure characterization method especially the in situ analysis instruments. The study of energy storage mechanism would enable the cyclic stability more comprehensive for their real causes.
(ii) With an eye to the future, it is still very important to improve the other electrochemical performance, for examples, energy density, rate retention, self-discharging problem, and the cost.
(iii) Recent years, micro, flexible, and wearable supercapacitors are also hot research topics in the field of energy storage system. We believe that a very important practical index for functional supercapacitor devices is their cycle life. It is also very urgent to formulate standards for the cycle life of various functional devices in the future.
(iv) For commercial supercapacitors, cyclic stability is a basic requirement. Most of the current commercial electrode materials are carbon materials. The commercialization of other electrode materials is mainly limited by their poor cycle life. Therefore, how to improve the cycle stability of electrode materials is a key problem in commercial supercapacitors.
(v) The electrolyte-philicity is another key aspect for the high electrochemical performance and good cyclic stability. There would be a equilibrium in the electrode and electrolyte. Too less electrolyte-philic property would lead to the fact that electrode materials cannot be wetted by the electrolyte, which is the first important step guaranteeing the following electrochemically reaction or adsorption or intercalation, while too much electrolyte-philicity would cause the structure destruction or even dissolving in electrolyte during charging and discharging processes. So, the property of electrolyte-philicity of electrode needs to be further studied for high performance supercapacitors with good cyclic stability.
(vi) Besides supercapacitors, the cyclic stability of the other energy storage devices like various batteries is also very important. We hope this review also could provide some references for the other battery system or attach universal attention for the study of the cyclic stability.
