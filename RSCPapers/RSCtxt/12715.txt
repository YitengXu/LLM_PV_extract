        Dihydronaphthyl-based [60]fullerene bisadduct derivative, NC60BA, was synthesized at mild temperature in high yield. NC60BA not only possesses a LUMO energy level 0.16 eV higher than PC61BM but also has amorphous nature that can overcome thermal-driven crystallization. The fabricated P3HT:NC60BA-based polymer solar cells exhibit superior photovoltaic performance and thermal stability compared to PC61BM-based devices under the same conditions.

Fullerene derivatives have proven to be important n-type semiconductors for organic electronics.1,2 Among them, [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) and its corresponding C70 derivative PC71BM are predominantly used as acceptors in bulk heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells (PSCs).2,3 PCBM offers the advantages of good solubility in common organic solvents, high electron mobility, and high electron affinity.2 However, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of PCBM is at a relatively low energy level, which results in lower open circuit voltage (Voc) of the PSCs with poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) as a donor.4 So it is significant to optimize fullerene derivatives' structure for increasing their LUMO energy level,5 improving their optical absorption6 and tuning their solubility.7 The bisadduct of PCBM (bisPCBM) showed a higher-lying LUMO energy level and the PSC based on P3HT:bisPCBM demonstrated higher Voc.8 Recently, a remarkable bisadduct fullerene derivative, ICBA (indene-C60 bisadduct), has been reported.9 The optimized P3HT:ICBA PSC exhibited a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 6.48% with a high Voc of 0.84 V.10 Since then bisadduct fullerene derivatives11 have emerged as new acceptor materials with higher photovoltaic performance for PSCs.
Although ICBA showed excellent photovoltaic properties, the synthesis of ICBA required a large excess of indene at high temperature, which increases its cost and limits its future practical application in PSCs. Herein we report the facile synthesis and photovoltaic studies of a dihydronaphthyl-based [60]fullerene bisadduct derivative, NC60BA (Scheme 1). NC60BA was synthesized from Diels–Alder reaction of C60 and in situ generated o-quinodimethane at 80 °C in 72% yield. NC60BA not only possesses a LUMO energy level 0.16 eV higher than PC61BM but also has amorphous nature that can overcome thermal-driven crystallization. A PCE of 5.37% was achieved from the P3HT:NC60BA-based PSC with a high Voc of 0.82 V. Moreover, the NC60BA-based devices exhibited much improved thermal stability compared to PC61BM-based PSCs.
 Scheme 1  Structure and synthetic route of NC60BA. 
Diels–Alder reaction is one of the most outstanding methods for the derivatization of fullerenes, which behave as good dienophiles reacting with a large variety of dienes.12 As depicted in Scheme 1, two different synthetic procedures were generally used for the in situ generation of o-quinodimethane for the subsequent Diels–Alder reaction with [60]fullerene. For the direct method from 1,2-bis(bromomethyl)benzene, iodide and high temperature were necessary for the initiation of the reaction, as a consequence, epoxide C60O derivatives were inevitably concomitant as confirmed by mass spectroscopy (Fig. S3, see ESI†). In contrast, reaction of o-quinodimethanes (produced from the sultine precursor) with fullerene can occur smoothly at ca. 80 °C by extrusion of SO2 without production of any organic or inorganic byproducts, and epoxide C60O derivatives were invisible on MS (Fig. S2, see ESI†). Although the latter involves two steps, the sultine can be easily prepared from 1,2-bis(bromomethyl)benzene by reaction with rongalite in DMF with addition of a catalytic amount of TBAB at 0 °C.13NC60BA was synthesized by Diels–Alder reaction of C60 and in situ generated o-quinodimethane prepared from the sultine at 80 °C in 72% yield. The crude product was purified first by silica gel column chromatography and then by HPLC equipped with a Buckyprep column using toluene as the eluent. NC60BA possesses excellent solubility in common organic solvents such as THF, chloroform, toluene, and o-dichlorobenzene. The molecular structure of NC60BA was confirmed by MALDI-TOF MS. Notably, the obtained NC60BA was a mixture of isomers14 as confirmed by 1H and 13C NMR spectra, which wasn't conducted further separation as it is time consuming and was used directly to fabricate the photovoltaic devices due to their similar electrochemical properties.

UV-Vis
absorption spectra of the fullerene derivatives in THF are shown in Fig. 1a. In the visible region from 400 to 550 nm, the absorbance of NC60BA is slightly stronger than that of PC61BM, which is a positive indication that NC60BA favours much effective solar absorption and may contribute to the improvement of efficiency in PSCs relative to that of PC61BM.

(b) Cyclic voltammograms of NC60BA (red) and PC61BM (blue) in ODCB/MeCN (5/1) containing tetrabutylammonium perchlorate as a supporting electrolyte (vs. Ag/Ag+). (c) DSC analysis (10 °C min−1) for NC60BA (red) and PC61BM (blue). (d) Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of NC60BA (red) at a heating rate of 20 °C min−1. 
Electrochemical properties of the fullerene derivatives were studied by cyclic voltammetry (Fig. 1b). NC60BA and PC61BM exhibit three quasi-reversible reduction waves in negative potential range from 0 to −2.5 V vs.Ag/Ag+. Table 1 lists the half-wave potentials of the reduction processes for fullerene derivatives. It can be seen that the first (E1), second (E2) and third (E3) reduction potentials of NC60BA all shift negatively relative to PC61BM. The onset reduction potentials (Eredon) of PC61BM and NC60BA are −0.79 and −0.95 V, respectively. According to the equation:15ELUMO = −e(Eredon + 4.71) (eV), the LUMO energy levels of PC61BM and NC60BA are estimated as −3.92 and −3.76 eV, respectively. The LUMO energy level of NC60BA is 0.16 eV higher than PC61BM, and this improvement can be explained by the reduced π-conjugation and electron delocalization of C60 caused by the second addend. Most importantly, the higher LUMO energy level of NC60BA is desirable for its application as acceptor in PSCs to improve Voc.

Thermal properties of fullerene derivatives are closely related to the lifetime of practical PSC devices. From differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurement results, we can see that PC61BM shows a crystallization peak at 286 °C (Fig. 1c). In contrast, no crystallization transition appears for NC60BA. These DSC results indicate that NC60BA is amorphous in nature. As a result, it can overcome thermal-driven crystallization so as to construct thermally stable PSCs.16Fig. 1d shows the thermal gravimetric analysis of NC60BA. The decomposition temperature (Td) of NC60BA is as high as 426 °C, which further reveals its high thermal stability. Different from our compound, many of the Diels–Alder cycloadducts to fullerene are found to be thermally unstable because they undergo cycloreversion to give the component molecules.17 The high thermal stability of NC60BA may be ascribed to the aromatization of the addend.
PSCs based on the ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:acceptor/Ca/Al configuration were fabricated and characterized to evaluate the photovoltaic performance of NC60BA in comparison with PC61BM. The control P3HT:PC61BM device showed a PCE of 4.21% (Voc = 0.59 V, Jsc = 10.54 mA cm−2, and FF = 0.68). As expected, the P3HT:NC60BA BHJ solar cell demonstrated a PCE of 5.37% (Voc = 0.82 V, Jsc = 9.88 mA cm−2 and FF = 0.67) under the same fabrication conditions (Fig. 2a). The increased PCE of an NC60BA-based solar cell should benefit from the higher Voc resulting from the elevated LUMO energy level. External quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of the PSCs based on P3HT:PC61BM and P3HT:NC60BA are shown in Fig. 2b. High EQE values were observed in both PC61BM-based and NC60BA-based devices, which confirms the higher Jsc values of the devices and suggests that the photon–electron conversion processes are rather efficient.

To investigate the performance stability and related morphological stability of fabricated devices under thermal treatment, the P3HT:NC60BA and P3HT:PC61BM devices were isothermally heated at 150 °C for 5, 10 and 20 h prior to the deposition of the top electrode. The results revealed that an NC60BA-based device had much improved thermal stability and the PCE slightly decreased from 5.17% to 4.55% even after heat treatment for 20 h (Fig. 3a). In contrast, the PCE of a P3HT:PC61BM device significantly decreased from 4.27% to 1.94% under the same conditions (Fig. 3b). To further understand this phenomenon, a morphology characterization was performed in situ by an optical microscope. As shown in Fig. 4a, well-proportioned morphology was kept for P3HT:NC60BA blend after thermal annealing for 20 h; in contrast, uneven PC61BM crystals appeared for the P3HT:PC61BM case (Fig. 4b), indicating that thermal-driven crystallization for PC61BM did exist and led to the D–A phase separation as a consequence. In a word, the amorphous nature of NC60BA contributes to the thermal stability of PSC.

In summary, we have designed and synthesized a new dihydronaphthyl-based [60]fullerene bisadduct derivative, NC60BA, which is easily synthesized in high yield. The unique amorphous nature, higher-lying LUMO energy level, and thermal stability of NC60BA are beneficial to be used as acceptor in the PSCs. Especially, the higher LUMO of NC60BA resulting in the higher Voc was the key for P3HT-based PSCs to achieve better performance. A PCE of 5.37% was achieved from the P3HT:NC60BA BHJ solar cell with a higher Voc of 0.82 V. In addition, the NC60BA-based devices exhibited much improved thermal stability. These results indicate that NC60BA is a promising candidate used in PSCs.
