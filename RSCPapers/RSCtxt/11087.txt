    , Accepted 22nd June 2016First published on 22nd June 2016AbstractWe describe a trinuclear phenanthroline, linked with a Schiff base cobalt complex, displaying superior performances in homogeneous electrocatalytic water oxidation reaction in neutral solution with an extraordinary turnover frequency of 119 s−1. Subsequently, the complexes are successfully immobilized on the surface of TiO2 nanorod arrays for improvement of photoconversion efficiency of three times that of pristine photoanode under simulated solar irradiation.
Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting has held wide attention because it is regarded as a promising approach to tackle energy and environmental challenges nowadays.1–3 The most crucial parts in a typical PEC cell are the photoelectrodes, the activity, stability and earth-abundance of which should all be considered.4 Among diverse materials, titania (TiO2) is one of the most attractive semiconductors with a suitable band position for solar-irradiating H2/O2 generation.5–7 However, owing to the sluggish anodic water oxidation, an additional bias is required for the observation of significant PEC water splitting, while accumulated photoelectrons and holes would recombine rapidly. For improvement of these imperfections, a number of literature reports indicated that integrating a water oxidation catalyst (WOC) with a photon-absorbing semiconductor gave hope of diminishing the external energy needed to accelerate the rate of photoholes-to-water and raise the overall solar-to-fuel efficiency.8–10 Therefore, to exploit robust WOCs could enable the refinement of the available semiconductors with considerably lower conversion efficiency than theoretical.
To date, first row transition metals, such as Ti, Fe, Co, Ni, and Mn, have displayed impressive performance in the field of catalysis.11–21 In particular, studies of nanostructured heterogeneous WOCs have become a very popular area of research recently due to their thermodynamic stability, high activity and longevity.22–24 Among them, cobalt-based catalysts for water oxidation show exceptional performance and have been reported as ‘hot materials’.25–30 Recently, an amorphous cobalt phosphate (Co-Pi) layer was found to be an active co-catalyst for improving PEC performance, generally constructed on the surface of semiconductors by photo-assisted electrodeposition.10,31–33 Though the method is facile, the optimizations of the thickness and photocurrent are complicated situations. Specifically, the thickness of the Co-Pi layer would affect the optical transparence and the holes transfer from semiconductor to water.10 However, to the best of our knowledge, this co-catalyst layer is suggested to be thin and active for water oxidation.34 The suggestion thus enlightens us if monolayer oxygen-evolving molecules could be grown directly through chemical bonds on semiconductors such as TiO2.35
Transition metal complexes, including mononuclear, binuclear, or multinuclear, are well-studied molecules for water-splitting in neutral electrolyte.16,36–38 Many studies have investigated the geometric structures, electrochemical properties and transition-state intermediates during the catalysis by such molecules, providing great contributions to the understanding and development of photosystem II (PSII). Herein, we report a cobalt-based phenanthroline Schiff base complex as an efficient electrocatalyst with an overpotential of 310 mV in phosphate buffer solution (PBS, pH = 7.0) and a high turnover frequency (TOF). Its homogeneous catalytic property is then confirmed and makes possible investigation of the catalytic mechanism on the molecular level, revealing the distinguished functions of phenanthroline and salen-center cobalts during water oxidation turnover from experimental results and theoretical calculations. Due to the binding of phenolic hydroxyl with titanium, the molecular complexes are successfully grown on the TiO2 nanorod (NR) arrays, which show significantly improved photoconversion efficiency, more than three times as high as the unmodified TiO2 NRs. Only a few articles report the attachment of small molecules or complexes to TiO2 for improving photoconversion, whereas most of them are sensitizing dyes, which supply a new photo-injection mechanism from the molecular orbital instead of the energy band in the semiconductors. This is definitely distinguishable from the molecular electrocatalyst highlighted in this study, as directly facilitating the process of photoholes (generated from the semiconductor) to water at the interface of the photoanode and electrolyte. Because of the molecular level of the co-catalyst, the cobalt content on the electrode is extremely low but illustrates advanced performance contrasted with Co-Pi, supporting the feasible approach of linking organic–metal complexes with high catalytic activity to semiconductors.
A phenanthroline-based Schiff-base (PBI) ligand [5,6-bis(salicylideneimino)-1,10-phenanthroline] is synthesized39 and supports nitrogen and oxygen in the phenanthroline and salen cavity, respectively, for bonding with the metal. Therefore, there are two states of Co in the complex, in which one Co connects to the nitrogen sites in the phenanthroline (phen-Co) and the other Co is inserted into the cavity containing the bisimino and hydroxyl moieties (salen-Co).40 The chemical structure of Co-PBI is displayed in Fig. 1a. Moreover, we also fabricated Co-phen (cobalt(II)-1,10-phenanthroline) and Co-P0 [Co-(phenbisimino)2] with only one metal center for reference. The synthetic routes and characterizations of the complexes are described in detail in the ESI.†

(b) CVs of the three complexes at 1.0 mM Co-PBI and at 3.0 mM for the other complexes (at the same concentration of cobalt) in phosphate buffer (pH = 7.0); inset is the enlarged region of the CoII/III redox peaks of Co-PBI. (c) Time-resolved oxygen evolved from Co-PBI at a potential of 1.5 V vs. NHE. 
First, the cyclic voltammetry (CV) characteristics of 1.0 mM molecular catalysts in the 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer electrolyte (pH = 7.0) were investigated, as shown in Fig. 1b. We measured the potential versus the Ag/AgCl reference electrode and reported the results versus the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE) for better comparison. The significant irreversible oxidation waves were observed at the positive potential ranging from 1.3 V to 1.7 V, wherein the Co-PBI exhibits the highest current density at ∼1.54 V. This observation is assigned to the water oxidation process associated with the CoIII/CoIV transfer, as well as the oxidation of CoII/CoIII that previously occurred, shown via observation of the irreversible anodic peak at ∼0.8 V in the inset.41,42 In addition, the scan rate normalized CVs of Co-PBI illustrate an increase of I/V1/2 with decreasing scan rate, as shown in Fig. S1.† It is expected that the O–O bond formation is the rate-determining chemical step before diffusional electron transfer at the electrode.43 Subsequently, the product of the catalytic reaction (molecular O2) was monitored by a dissolved oxygen sensor using controlled potential electrolysis. Fig. 1c shows the amount of oxygen evolved with (red line) or without (black line) the addition of Co-PBI. These results indicate water oxidation is only catalyzed in the presence of the complex. The theoretical value (gray line) exhibited in Fig. 1c reveals a faradaic efficiency of 97%.
The CVs in PBS with the addition of catalyst concentration are shown in Fig. S2,† wherein the current density of the oxidation wave is significantly increasing. In specific, the plot (Fig. S3a†) of catalytic current density at ∼1.54 V vs. NHE against the concentrations of Co-PBI reveals a typical linear relation. This result is consistent with a first-order dependence on catalyst, which indicates that the rate-limiting step involves only a single-site cobalt. Therefore, this means the water oxidation occurs on one cobalt ion to form the O–O bond in a Co-PBI molecule in a mononuclear complex. However, both types of Co sites, in which the central Co binds to the nitrogen heterocyclic rings and the other two conjugated cobalt cations bind in the Schiff-base cavities, could be the active centers for OER; they would, however, show a difference from the free energy of the intermediates. We will discuss this issue using a density functional theory (DFT) calculation later. Furthermore, bulk electrolysis was performed, as shown in Fig. S3b,† at different concentrations of the WOC. The background of the current density is very small, whereas the catalytic current increases with an increasing amount of Co-PBI. The catalyst is found to be very stable, with no obvious decrease of the current during the 1 h electrolysis.
To better understand the behaviors of the oxygen-evolving Co-PBI complex, we must determine whether the water oxidation is a homogeneous process or if the complex is acting only as the precursor for the active heterogeneous film generation in the neutral condition. The electronic absorption spectra of the electrolyte-dissolved Co-PBI are investigated before and after electrolysis. In Fig. S4,† we find no clear distinction on the molecular nature of the catalyst even after a long period of catalysis (24 h), confirmed by the electronic absorption and Raman spectra. Moreover, scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) images also present the surface of the working electrode, where no visible deposit is found after electrolysis (Fig. S5†). One well-known heterogeneous electrocatalytic water oxidation process is that the electrolysis of Co2+ in phosphate buffer will form an efficient oxygen-evolving catalyst film (Co-Pi) on the electrode in situ.14,44,45 Thus, we compare the CVs of the rinsed electrodes after being incubated in the electrolytes of Co-PBI and Co-Pi. Fig. S7† shows that the anodic wave of the electrode after being cycled in Co-PBI complex solution disappeared in fresh PBS, whereas the Co-Pi had a large current density. The apparent difference reveals the homogeneous catalysis toward OER on our synthesized Co-PBI.
We then calculate the turnover frequency (TOF) from the CV results. The catalytic rate constants (kcat) can be expressed by eqn (1), where Ic is the current, nc is the number of electrons transferred in the catalytic wave, Ip and np are the relative values in the non-catalytic wave, and ν is the scan rate.18,46 (1)
Using the Co(II)/Co(III) redox couple (Fig. 1b inset) as an estimate of Ip, we calculate a kcat value of ∼119 s−1, which reveals an exceptional turnover rate for water oxidation. In addition, the TOF of Co-(phenbisimino)2 is ∼63 s−1 at 1.5 V, indicating the cobalt site in the Schiff base cavity is crucial in the electrocatalytic reaction. Table S1† lists the catalytic performance of recently reported homogeneous electrocatalysts, compared with the complex in this study.
The highly active water oxidation complex is then designed to grow on the titania photoanode as the monolayer co-catalyst. We adopt a typical hydrothermal method to prepare the TiO2 NR arrays on a fluorine-doped tin oxide glass with an average diameter of ∼100 nm (see the scanning electron microscopy in Fig. S16†).35 Subsequently, the Co-PBI complexes are attached to the surface of TiO2via a typical Ti–O bond between the phenol hydroxyl and Ti4+.47,48 The scheme in Fig. 2 shows three steps for the complex coupling by means of the Ti–O bond. In brief, the phenanthroline-based salen (PBI) ligands form on the photoanode, after which time the cobalt cations are chelated as phen-Co and salen-Co. Furthermore, the ligands of PBI are added to produce the Co-P2 with the phen-Co as a bridge. Eventually, Co-PBI complexes are fabricated on the TiO2 after subsequent cobalt addition. The modified nanoarrays are successfully and facilely prepared at room temperature. The size of the Co-PBI is estimated by the molecular model after geometric optimization by DFT calculations. The results illustrate the maximum dimension of Co-PBI is approximately 11.6 Ångstrom, of which the distance between two hydroxyls in the cavity of the Schiff base is 2.4 Ångstrom. From the crystal structure of rutile titania, the distance between two titanium atoms is 4.6 Ångstrom. Therefore, it is reasonable for the Co-PBI to be well matched with the TiO2.

The photoelectrochemical performance was then measured and is shown in Fig. 3. The linear sweep voltammograms (LSV) under simulated solar illumination equipped with an AM 1.5G filter (100 mW cm−2) are first carried out at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 in Fig. 3a, illustrating the boost in photocurrent density of TiO2@Co-PBI compared to the unmodified TiO2. The photocurrent density (at +0.3 V vs. NHE) of the former reaches 0.70 mA cm−2 which is three times higher than the TiO2 NRs at 0.23 mA cm−2. Regarding the TiO2@Co-P2, its PEC activity also sees a significant enhancement with a photocurrent density of 0.47 mA cm−2 at 0.3 V. Subsequently, the photoconversion efficiency (η) is also calculated according to the LSV results with the following equation: η = I × (E° − V)/Jlight(2)where I is the photocurrent density (mA cm−2) at the measured bias, E° is the normal reversible potential, which is 0.817 V vs. NHE for the oxygen evolution at pH = 7, V is the applied bias potential vs. RHE, and Jlight is the irradiated power density (100 mW cm−2). Fig. 3b shows the plots of the photoconversion efficiency versus applied bias, revealing the much higher η of 0.35% after being modified by Co-PBI. Moreover, the external bias of TiO2@Co-PBI at the peak of the photoconversion efficiency also shows the decrease to 0.23 V vs. NHE contrasted with pure TiO2 NRs. It is assumed that the superficial cobalt-based catalysts could reduce the kinetic barrier for water oxidation of which the overpotential is relatively low compared with pristine TiO2. The results, therefore, suggest the conjunction of WOCs successfully amplifies the process of solar energy conversion. We also determined the improvement of the photocurrent density and η for the hematite photoanode after immobilizing the Co-PBI complex (Fig. S24, ESI†), contrasted with the deposited Co-Pi film. Similarly, we see enhanced performance, revealing that the strategy of molecular water oxidation catalyst-modified semiconductor could be extended and further advanced.

The transient PCE responses of TiO2@Co-PBI are determined at different potentials in Fig. 4a, wherein the time resolved photocurrent is recorded while illumination was turned on and off. The photocurrents were enhanced by 3.0, 2.8 and 2.2 times at 0, 0.2 and 0.817 V, respectively, for a Co-PBI WOCs modified photoanode compared to an unmodified TiO2 NRs electrode (Fig. S17†). However, there is no additional optical absorption of the coupled complexes leading to the increment of photocurrent according to the UV-Vis spectra (Fig. S18a†). Moreover, Mott–Schottky plots are shown in Fig. S18b,† wherein the unmodified TiO2 NRs and TiO2@Co-PBI have similar flat band potentials under a certain frequency. In addition, we summarize the comparisons of PEC performance among TiO2, TiO2@Co-P2, TiO2@Co-PBI and TiO2@Co-Pi, regarding the cobalt content, photocurrent density and photoconversion efficiency. The bar chart in Fig. 4b reveals the superiorities of our prepared TiO2@Co-PBI photoanode with the lower cobalt owing the ultrathin-layer coupling but the higher activity. The results also indicate that the homogeneous WOCs could be developed as an advanced co-catalyst for photoelectrodes, which would not aggregate and transform to a deactivated or thicker film, contrasted with heterogeneous WOCs. Furthermore, we report that this Co-PBI is a high TOF catalyst (>100 s−1) so that the superficial accumulated holes would be transferred to H2O rapidly. In addition, the complex attaching on the semiconductor also constructs a passivation layer, which is very thin thus preventing parasitic light absorption or charge-transfer inhibition.49

The electrochemical impedance spectrum (EIS) could provide solid evidence to evaluate the kinetics of carrier transfer at the interface of photoanode and electrolyte. Fig. S19† clearly compares the changes in the charge transfer resistance of TiO2 NRs with and without Co-PBI, wherein we observe a dramatic decrease after the complex's coupling. The phenomenon reveals that an acceleration of light generated holes has occurred, promoting the rate of oxygen and hydrogen evolution. Moreover, the introduction of the catalyst may also form the surface passivation layer, which leads to a lower charge carrier surface density than for a bare semiconductor.49 We also determine the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) of pristine TiO2 and TiO2@Co-PBI photoanodes in Fig. S20.† Both exhibit the maximum value at ∼380 nm, which is consistent with the reported value.50 However, an IPCE of almost double for the modified the electrode is observed, demonstrating the introduction of Co-PBI could improve the charge injection and collection efficiency. Moreover, we have determined the electrocatalytic behavior of the Co-PBI complex in phosphate electrolyte (pH = 7.0) in this study, revealing the homogeneously catalyzing water oxidation from the results of absorption spectra, SEM images, EDX spectrum and electrochemical measurements (in the section “Investigation of homogeneous or heterogeneous catalysis in the neutral solution” in the ESI†). These results have illustrated our synthesized complex could retain its structure via a typical homogeneous electrocatalysis rather than be decomposed and deposited during water oxidation turnover. After being immobilized on the TiO2, the complex would reasonably maintain the original architecture in the same condition. Accordingly, this study also implies the homogeneous oxygen-evolving complexes display a more efficient route to boost the photocurrent than heterogeneous deposits such as Co-Pi, which is consistent with the recent reports (of a noble metal Ir complex immobilized on hematite).51,52 More specifically, the ultrathin layer of molecular oxygen-evolving complex provides an additional charge transfer route across the photoanode|H2O interface, while bulk film replaces the original interface with a different one (Co-Pi|H2O). In this approach, the addition of molecular catalysts is much more straightforward, unlike the introduction of new interface (bulk oxide film) that may require careful optimizations (e.g., thickness, transparency) to tune the activity. Furthermore, we extend this strategy to earth-abundant metal complexes, as well as coupling them on two known photoanodes, indicating its universality.
The obvious differences between Co-P2 and Co-PBI on photoelectrocatalysis are essential to investigate. Because of the single-site catalytic property in the OER process, it is necessary to determine which cobalt in the trinuclear complex has better functionality. To verify the most active site in a molecule of the catalyst, we adopted theoretical calculations that consider either the salen-Co or the phen-Co in Co-PBI as the reaction center. Fig. 4c demonstrates the free energy change profiles for the oxygen-oxygen bond generation on phen-Co or salen-Co, which is considered to be the rate-determining step in the water oxidation. A significant reduction of free energy change is observed on the cobalt site conjugated with the Schiff base cavity compared to the Co bonded to nitrogen heterocyclic rings (phenanthroline). The result reveals that the OER is more inclined to occur on the salen-Co, supporting the related studies on the superior and wide applicability in the field of catalyzing oxidation based on Schiff base ligand complexes.53 In short, the salen and phenol groups would be beneficial for the water nucleophilic attack reaction via the formation of hydrogen bonds with water, lowering the oxidation potentials in catalytic water oxidation.54,55 In addition, the presence of two methoxyl groups near the salen-cobalt site could possibly accelerate the oxygen–oxygen bond formation according to a previous report.54 Regarding the functions of the central phen-Co (discussed in detail in the ESI†), it may be more important to (i) improve the solubility of the whole molecule in the water and (ii) act as a “bridge” to link the two salen-Co frames into one unit for increasing the concentration of the active centers and reduce the required potential for salen-CoII/CoIII transformation. Therefore, our DFT calculations combined with the previous research studies could well explain the outstanding OER performance of the Co-PBI, as well as provide some theoretical evidence for the metal–salen complexes as efficient electro-/photo-induced WOCs.54,56,57 Importantly, it also addresses the question why the PEC performance of TiO2@Co-PBI is more outstanding than the TiO2@Co-P2 photoanode.
Conclusions
An active WOC based on the trinuclear cobalt-coordinating Schiff base and phenanthroline groups (Co-PBI) was synthesized and found to be a homogeneous electrocatalyst in neutral solution with a TOF of 119 s−1. Moreover, we successfully extended the complex for use in photoelectrochemical water splitting, which couples on TiO2 NR arrays. The remarkable improvement of solar-to-fuel efficiency is observed with the photocurrent density of 0.77 mA cm−2, reaching three times that of pristine TiO2. The evidence shows the Co-PBI complex acts as the co-catalyst of the semiconductor so that it triggers the acceleration of the photoholes transfer between photoanode and water. Compared with the well-known heterogeneous Co-Pi WOC, our Co-PBI exhibits higher activity and photoconversion efficiency, but much lower cobalt loading. Theoretical calculations are subsequently performed to acquire the free energy change of the O–O bond forming intermediates, indicating that the cobalt site in the salen-phenol cavity is more active than the nitrogen of phenanthroline binding. This study emphasizes the homogeneous water oxidation electrocatalysts would be superior for enhancing PEC performance of available semiconductors, because of the high turnover frequency, molecule-level layer with full transparency and easy to design by molecular engineering. Thus, more oxygen-evolving transition metal complexes such as Co-PBI might enable a variety of breakthroughs on PEC hydrogen production technology.
