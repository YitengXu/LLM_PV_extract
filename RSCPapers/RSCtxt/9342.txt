    , Accepted 17th October 2022First published on 18th October 2022AbstractSingle-photon hot-band absorption-assisted anti-Stokes photoluminescence (ASPL) is a non-equilibrium process which causes a local cooling effect and which therefore is accompanied by a reverse heat flux from the warmer environment. Here, we demonstrate that the thermal properties of the medium, i.e., its thermal conductivity and specific heat capacity, play a significant role in driving the ASPL of an emitter placed in it. Exploiting seven different solvents and the near-infrared tricarbocyanine dye as a single-photon upconverter, we show an obvious correlation of activation energy and the quantum yield (QY) of ASPL with the solvent thermal conductivity and specific heat capacity, respectively. A linear fit of the above correlations leads to the predictions that the maximum QY of ASPL should be observed in a vacuum where it should reach a value of ∼10% for the exploited dye, which is close to the QY of its Stokes emission and that the high thermal conductivity of the solvent assists in a stepwise population of the hot band, which thus facilitates the hot-band absorption-assisted ASPL. These findings lead to the conclusion that the selection of a solvent with appropriate thermal properties may help one to control the efficiency of the one-photon energy upconversion.
Introduction
Infrared (IR) radiation is a large component of energy available on the Earth, because almost a half of the solar energy coming to the Earth's surface and almost 100% of the outgoing terrestrial radiation belongs to the IR part of the electromagnetic spectrum. However, this huge flow of energy is mostly considered as thermal waste and is not used for practical purposes on a large scale. There are some difficulties in capturing the IR energy using quantum photoelectric devices, such as solar cells,1,2 because the band gap of the respective materials must match or should be smaller than the energy of the thermal quant. However, in the low-energy spectral range, thermal noise has a significant effect on the operation of a photodetector. Therefore, the efficient consumption of IR radiation requires other types of devices and/or new original methods and concepts of energy collection, amplification and processing for its further use. The concept of the upconversion of low-energy IR photons into higher-energy photons, which lie in the visible part of the spectrum, is a promising option by which the vibrational energy of molecules or crystals, whose interatomic oscillations are due to absorbing heat from the environment, can be collected, with a subsequent upconversion of this energy into a convenient form, i.e., photons of the visible range.
A single-photon upconversion of organic dyes that occurs via single-step hot-band absorption (HBA) and then yields an anti-Stokes photoluminescence (ASPL) just provides a collection of thermal energy and its conversion to a higher energy domain. This process has certain advantages over multi-photon upconversion, as it does not require a high excitation intensity or an additional sensitizer, but it employs only energy of vibrational modes at environmental temperatures.3 Although significant progress was achieved recently in the development of multi-photon upconversion based on triplet–triplet annihilation (TTA) which demonstrates currently a highest visible-to-UV TTA-upconversion efficiency of 20.5% using a UV emitter, 1,4-bis((triisopropylsilyl)ethynyl)naphthalene, and a Ir(C6)2(acac) sensitizer,4 many challenges remain for the application of the TTA-upconversion under sunlight conditions, which require 1–2 orders of magnitude increase in the intermediate state lifetime, energy transfer rate, or generation rate before solar upconversion could start to become efficient.5 On the other hand, a drawback of the single-photon upconversion is that it has a limited application for energy upconversion in solar cells because of the modest values of the anti-Stokes shift and also it can be observed only in limited classes of organic compounds, such as xanthene-based chromophores (luciferin and rhodamine derivatives),6,7 Alexa Fluor,8 porphyrin,9 spirolactam moieties under specific conditions,10 polymethine,11 oxazine,4 diarylethenes,12 and carbon quantum dots13,14 as well. Although the mechanism of HBA-assisted ASPL is known to be due to the contribution of vibrational excitation of the molecule, i.e., the population of the hot band of the ground state (Fig. 1), it is largely unknown which vibrational modes are responsible for the above effect and how the repopulation of specific energy levels in the hot band after the emission further maintains the ASPL.
 Fig. 1  Scheme of ASPL when excited with the same excitation energy of the compound with the polar ground state and neutral excited state in solvents of different polarities. Q1 and Q2 denote different hot bands or thermal energies removed from the emitter as a result of ASPL. 
Single-photon ASPL possesses a relatively small anti-Stokes shift determined by the width of the hot band (∼1000–1600 cm−1) and the relative intensity of ASPL is dependent on population of this hot band too. Such a population can be assisted due to the increasing temperature of the environment; however, this way faces a bottleneck, as increasing temperatures normally decrease the PL quantum yield due to the scattering of the electronic excitations by vibronic modes as well. Therefore, the search for other, non-energetic, factors that can promote ASPL is preferred.
If the molecular structure of the emitter and the temperature are fixed, the factors that can influence the quantum yield (QY) of ASPL can be related to the properties of the ambient medium, such as the polarity and viscosity of the solvent used, molecular rigidity, and the rate of solvent relaxation as well.15,16 Single-photon ASPL is specific in that it occurs via the population of the hot levels of the ground state, which requires the activation of the ground state electron across the hot band before it will be picked up by a photon to the LUMO level of the emitter. Here, we show that certain factors, namely, the thermal conductivity, polarity and/or specific heat capacity of the employed solvent, play an important role in reducing the activation barrier and increasing the QY of ASPL, respectively, of a specific near-infrared (NIR) tricarbocyanine dye.
Experimental
Materials
The chemical structure of triethylammonium 4-(2-(2-(1,1-dimethy-3-(4-sulfonatobutyl)-1H-benzo[e]indol-2(3H)-ylidene)ethylidene)-2-(diphenylamino)cyclopent-1-en-1yl)vinyl-1,1-dimethyl-1H-benzo[e]indol-3-ium-3-yl)butane-1-sulfonate (further referred to as the NIR tricarbocyanine dye) is shown in the inset of Fig. 2a. The dye synthesis and the dye's basic characteristics, such as the NMR spectrum and Tdecomp, were described earlier.17 Dioxane, tetrahydrofuran, dimethylformamide, dimethyl sulfoxide, isopropyl alcohol, glycerol, and acetonitrile were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. The procedure of the solution preparation was as follows. First, a stock solution (10−3 M) of the dye was prepared using the above solvents; then, the 10 μm stock solution was added to a cuvette containing 1 ml of the pure solvent to obtain a concentration of 10−5 M immediately before the optical measurements, to provide an equal concentration for all measured solutions.

In (c), the vertical dashed lines mark the band gaps, and the tangent lines are the linear fit of the HBA spectra for the different solvents used. 
Methods
The absorption and photoluminescence (PL) spectra were recorded using an AvaSpec-2048 spectrophotometer. Solutions were measured using a 10 mm quartz cuvette, where a pure solvent was used as a reference. Solid-state diode lasers operating at wavelengths of 780 nm (100 mW) and 980 nm (400 mW) were used as excitation sources for measuring Stokes and anti-Stokes emissions, respectively. The power densities of the sample illumination were about ∼150 mW cm−2 when measuring the Stokes emission and ∼400 mW cm−2 when measuring the anti-Stokes emission. The fluorescence signal was detected using a CCD through a 600 μm fiber and collected at a right-angle to the excitation light (dilute solutions). A relative QY of the Stokes emission was determined using the DMSO solution of the dye as a reference (QYref = 11.9%);18 the QY of ASPL was determined using the DMF solution of the dye as a reference (QYref = 3.7%),19 according to eqn (1):20 (1)where PLsample and PLref are the integral fluorescence of the sample and reference solutions, A(λexc) and Aref(λexc) are the absorption factors of the sample and reference solutions at an excitation wavelength, n and nref are the refractive indexes of the sample and reference solutions, respectively. Several (normally three) sets of experiments for each solvent used have been performed to determine the QY of ASPL; the final QY for the each solution is shown here as an average of the different experiments.
The temperature dependence of ASPL was measured between room temperature and 45–85 °C (depending on the solvent boiling point and dye stability in specific solvents), with a step of 3–5 °C. The derived activation energy of ASPL was calculated as an average from the heating and cooling cycles of the solution. The laser cooling experiment was performed using two identical cuvettes with the dye solution (10−3 M), one of which was laser-irradiated at 980 nm, and the other was not. Both the cuvettes were immersed into the thermo-regulated aqueous bath and supplied with thermocouples connected together in an anti-parallel mode. The further details of the laser cooling experiment can be found elsewhere.19
Results and discussion
Among seven solvents used, i.e., dioxane, tetrahydrofuran (THF), dimethylformamide (DMF), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), isopropyl alcohol (IPA), acetonitrile (ACN), and glycerol, a rough trend was observed that the solvent with a higher polarity yields a larger solvatochromic shift of the absorption and the ASPL maximum of the dye solutions (Fig. 2 and Table 1), which is consistent with the properties of the n → π* transitions in molecules possessing the polar ground state and neutral excited state, where the solvent polarity influences the energy of the dye ground state, but not the excited state.21 The above trend also indicates that the dye's HOMO–LUMO bandgap as determined from the energy of the absorption band (see Fig. S1a, ESI†) is increasing with the solvent polarity (Fig. 1), with the largest bandgap revealed for ACN and the smallest one for dioxane solution (Table 1). It should be noted however that the solvatochromic shift of IPA and ACN solutions is abnormally high and somewhat affects the above trend (Fig. S1b, ESI†).

The variation of the solvent polarity is accompanied by other changes in the ASPL band. First, the integral ASPL emission decreases with the increasing solvent polarity by more than two times from dioxane to ACN and glycerol solutions (Fig. 2a). As more polar solvents induce a larger bandgap for the dissolved emitter, the application of the same excitation wavelength (980 nm) leads to HBA occuring from more hot levels (Fig. 1); therefore, it might be suggested that the reduced ASPL emission is due to the poorer population of these levels in accordance with the Boltzmann distribution law (2)where εi is the energy of the vibrational level, kBT ≈ 26 meV at room temperature. However, the variation of the HBA intensity in the actual region near 980 nm as a function of solvent (inset in Fig. 2b and c) is much smaller than the above changes in the ASPL integral intensity; therefore, the above suggestion can be valid only partly. In fact, the exponential decay of the HBA tail due to the Boltzmann distribution of population of vibrational levels (2), which otherwise is also referred to as the Urbach tail22,23 due to similarity with the tail observed in disordered crystals, extends within a region of about 250–300 cm−1 width from the HOMO (Fig. 2c), i.e., within a quasi-continuous band due to rotational degrees of freedom of the molecule. In a deeper subgap region (>300 cm−1), the subgap absorption does not follow the exponential decay and HBA shows a fine structure due to the available bending and stretching vibrational modes of the molecule in this region, which have a discrete character and different dipole transitions and oscillation strength. The deviation from the exponential decay in this region can be explained by that the electronic excitations and the oscillation strength are concentrated into just a few transitions instead of dispersing over a band, which yields the higher absorption coefficient.24,25 The excitation energy (980 nm) is just within the major vibrational band of the molecule at ∼1100 cm−1 (C–N stretching and C–C–C bending26) that has a FWHM of ∼200 cm−1, which is similar to the bandgap variation (210 cm−1) due to the changes in the solvent polarity; therefore, the HBA in this region does not change significantly and does not show obvious solvent polarity dependence (Fig. 2c and Fig. S6, ESI†). Second, in more polar solvents, the ASPL emission occurs into a broader manifold of the hot levels (Fig. 1), leading to the corresponding broader ASPL bandwidth. This is clearly demonstrated by the ACN, IPA, and glycerol solutions which have the largest hypsochromic shifts of the ASPL band along with the largest ASPL bandwidths (Table 1 and Fig. 3).
 Fig. 3  Quantum yield and bandwidth of ASPL as a function of the (a) polarity and (b) specific heat capacity of the solvents used. Lines are the linear fit of the experimental data. QY values represent an average derived from the three sets of experiments. 
The dependence of the QY of ASPL on the solvent polarity can be fitted by a linear dependence (Fig. 3a). However, this linear dependence is accompanied by obvious deviations, because, while the solvent polarity is changing by almost three times from dioxane and THF to DMSO, the above solutions indicate almost the same solvatochromic shift of the ASPL emission and their QY varies insignificantly, i.e., from 4.2 to 4.9% (Table 1). As a result, the coefficient of determination (COD), i.e., a statistical measure of how well the regression predictions approximate the real data points, is relatively poor (Fig. 3a). Therefore, the excitation from the equally populated vibrational levels (where the solvatochromic shift is the same) cannot ideally provide the same QYASPL, respectively. At the same time, QYASPL can be fitted linearly as a function of the specific heat capacity (SHC) of the solvents, with a better COD (Fig. 3b). Here, the higher QY of ASPL is observed for the smaller SHC of the solvent, similarly to the dependence of the QY on the solvent polarity, with the decreasing QY by a factor of ∼2.5 with the increasing SHC from dioxane to IPA (Fig. 3 and Table 1). The similar dependencies of QYASPL on both the solvent polarity and SHC can be understood taking into account the fact that SHC itself roughly correlates with the solvent polarity, normally increasing with the increase of the latter. This trend can be traced for 22 different solvents (Fig. S2, ESI†). The explanation of this phenomenon is due to the fact that molecules of more polar solvents are bound by stronger intermolecular forces, which require more heat to induce the same temperature changes owing to the molecular motion compared to non-polar liquids, which indicates that the thermal capacity of the solvent increases as well. At the same time, the QY of the Stokes emission does not demonstrate a clear dependence on SHC, being in the range of 10.35 ± 2.85% (Fig. S3, ESI†).
The population of the vibrational levels of the molecular ground state leading to the HBA-assisted ASPL requires thermal activation, whose energy Ea can be extracted from the Arrhenius plot of the temperature dependence of ASPL, i.e., (3)where I is the process rate (here the intensity of ASPL), kB is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the absolute temperature. The temperature dependence of ASPL and Arrhenius plots are shown in Fig. 4 for two extreme cases of solutions with the largest and smallest activation energies observed for THF and ACN; the corresponding plots for the other solutions are given in the ESI† (Fig. S4). The good correspondence can be observed between the activation energy and the thermal conductivity of the solvent; i.e., the higher the thermal conductivity the smaller the activation energy is (Table 1 and Fig. 5). Higher deviation can be seen in the case of the IPA solution, since the IPA solution itself is unstable at high temperatures where its ASPL emission can be affected; for which, therefore, investigations were performed within a relatively small temperature range (Fig. S4, ESI†). In total, both linear fits of the QY (in percentages) as a function of the specific heat capacity and activation energy (in meV) as a function of the thermal conductivity (Fig. 3b and 5) are described by the equations: QY = 10.0 − 3.15Cp(4) Ea = 118 − 143λ(5)where Cp is the isobaric SHC, and λ is the thermal conductivity.

 Fig. 5  Activation energies of ASPL as a function of the thermal conductivity of the solvents used. 
From eqn (4), one obtains QY = 10% when Cp = 0, i.e., when the molecule is in vacuum. That is the maximum value of QYASPL that the molecule can reach. Interestingly, the found value approaches the QY of the Stokes emission (Fig. S3, ESI†), indicating that the nonzero heat capacity of the medium just affects ASPL. Being in solvent, the dye molecule shows the smaller QY of ASPL; the higher the Cp the lower the QY is. This result agrees well with the increasing FWHM of the ASPL band as a function of SHC (Fig. 3b). This means that the excited electron relaxes into a broader continuum of vibrational levels near the ground state, which is assisted by the heat exchange of the emitter with the environment,27,28 where the latter possesses a high heat capacity.
In eqn (5), the coefficient 118 ± 12 meV corresponds to the activation energy, when λ = 0, i.e., when the molecule is in vacuum. Importantly, the above energy corresponds to that of the C–H bend vibration in alkenes (∼950 cm−1),26 which should be mainly responsible for the HBA-assisted ASPL in tricarbocyanine dyes. However, the lower activation energy (600–900 cm−1) is found in the solvent media, which corresponds to the lower-energy bending of the polymethine chain; the increasing thermal conductivity of the solvent is accompanied with the tendency of the decreasing Ea (Table 1). Since the activation energy of ASPL corresponds to the thermal barrier, the ground-state electron must overcome, and the observed lower Ea compared to the energy due to the C–H bend vibration gives a clue that the electron activation here is a joint process of both the dye molecule and the environment, where the latter shares the thermal energy to assist the above activation. This means that such an activation can be a sum of the contributions of the low-energy vibrations of the dye chromophore and external thermal energy due to collisions with solvent molecules, which together make an electron to climb up in the hot band. The rate of the intermolecular transfer of thermal energy between the dye and the solvent surrounding occurs within several ps and is dependent on the solvent.27,28 The above conclusion also explains the contradiction between the activation energy found from the Arrhenius plot, which is relatively small and corresponds to bend vibrations, and the observed vibrational modes in the hot band that correspond to stretch vibrations, from which the HBA occurs.19
The other consequence from eqn (5) is that the activation energy should disappear for solvents whose thermal conductivity exceeds 0.82 W m−1 K−1. Unfortunately, no suitable solvent with such a high thermal conductivity for the dye is available to verify this prediction.
Other solvent parameters follow the changes in the activation energy in a worse manner. For example, the viscosity does not demonstrate any reasonable correspondence with the activation energy because IPA has a viscosity 6 times larger compared to ACN, but their activation energies are relatively close. Glycerol has a viscosity of 3 orders of magnitude larger compared to DMF, but their activation energies are close as well.
Since the observed activation energies of ∼80–110 meV (Table 1) correspond to the low-energy skeletal in-plain bending deformation of the chromophore chain, it can be suggested that the high thermal conductivity of the solvent assists in a stepwise population of the hot band, which thus facilitates the HBA-assisted ASPL. Therefore, the thermal energy is needed which is supplied by the environment to pick up electrons in the hot band. The efficiency of energy delivery is dependent on the thermal conductivity of the medium; the delivery should be provided just within the lifetime of the excited state (∼0.5 ns for this type of molecule)29 to populate the hot band and to provide the continuous emission of the dye molecule under CW excitation. Second, ASPL results in the local cooling of the molecule, as the emitted energy exceeds the absorbed one (Fig. 1). The laser cooling effect due to ASPL has been reported for the DMF solution of this dye earlier.30 The local cooling of the emitter with respect to the environment increases with the increasing temperature of the latter as this facilitates the better population of the hot band of the emitter (eqn (2)), which provides more carriers that contribute to ASPL. The comparison of DMSO and IPA solutions which have noticeably different thermal conductivities shows rather different laser cooling efficiencies as well. Particularly, at 80 °C of the bath temperature, the local cooling reaches 0.3 K for IPA and about 1.0 K for the DMSO solution (Fig. 6).
 Fig. 6  Statistical output of the laser cooling effect of DMSO (green) and IPA (black) solutions of the dye (10−3 M) in the form of the local temperature change ΔT of the sample solution irradiated by the laser at 980 nm compared to the temperature of the reference solution (pure solvent), as a function of the temperature of the exterior bath. 
Local cooling suppresses the fast repopulation of the dye's hot band and the recovery of the ASPL process, respectively, worsening ASPL under CW excitation. Therefore, a reverse heat flux from the environment to the emitter is needed to assist the recovery of ASPL, where the role of the thermal conductivity and thermal capacity of the environment can be significant; otherwise, ASPL would not be observed under a steady-state CW excitation.
The above suggestion is clearly supported by the Fourier law of heat transfer as a result of recovery (repopulation) of the hot band of a cooled emitter, (6)where  is the specific heat rate normal to the area S, λ is the thermal conductivity, and  is the gradient of the temperature. In turn, the temperature gradient is inversely proportional to the heat capacity of the medium, as can be shown using the first law of thermodynamics: δQ = dU + dA = dU = cVdT(7)where dA = 0 (in our case, the heat is spent to change the internal energy U and does not perform work A) and cV = (∂U/∂T)V.
Assuming that the heat flux is along X axis, eqn (6) and (7) yield (8)
In eqn (8), the recovery rate of the hot band, , is proportional to the thermal conductivity λ and inversely proportional to the specific heat capacity cV of the environment, which just explains the role of these terms in the HBA-assisted ASPL. That is, the high thermal conductivity of the surrounding medium facilitates the delivery of thermal energy to the relaxed and locally cooled molecule in order to recover its ASPL, whereas the high specific heat capacity of the medium dampens heat flux because it suppresses the creation of the high temperature gradient in the vicinity of the emitter.
Conclusions
In conclusion, we have demonstrated that the thermal properties of the solvent have a pronounced effect on the ASPL efficiency of tricarbocyanine dye solutions, influencing both the QY and the activation energy of ASPL. That is different from the Stokes emission, which is practically insensitive to the above properties, which can be explained by the fact that the Stokes emission does not require the delivery of thermal energy to the emitter, while ASPL does. The obtained empirical relationships between the activation energy of the molecule and the thermal conductivity and between the QY and SHC of the employed solvents give predictions concerning the behavior of the dye molecule in a vacuum too. Particularly, the latter relationship predicts that in the vacuum QY of ASPL should approach the QY of the Stokes emission, while increasing the specific heat capacity of the environment affects it. The former relationship predicts that in a vacuum the activation energy should be as high as ∼118 eV, whereas in solutions the observed activation energies (∼80–110 meV) are lower and correspond to the low-energy skeletal in-plain bending deformation of the chromophore chain. This discrepancy leads to the conclusion that the thermal conductivity of the environment most probably assists a stepwise population of the hot band towards higher vibrational levels. Thus, the selection of a solvent with appropriate thermal conductivity and specific heat capacity may help one to control the efficiency of a one-photon upconversion of energy.
