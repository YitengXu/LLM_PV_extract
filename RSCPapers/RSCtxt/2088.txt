    First published on 3rd September 2015AbstractPhotocatalytic hydrogen production and pollutant degradation provided both great opportunities and challenges in the field of sustainable energy and environmental science. Over the past few decades, we have witnessed fast growing interest and efforts in developing new photocatalysts, improving catalytic efficiency and exploring the reaction mechanism at the atomic and molecular levels. Owing to its relatively high efficiency, nontoxicity, low cost and high stability, TiO2 becomes one of the most extensively investigated metal oxides in semiconductor photocatalysis. Fundamental studies on well characterized single crystals using ultrahigh vacuum based surface science techniques could provide key microscopic insight into the underlying mechanism of photocatalysis. In this review, we have summarized recent progress in the photocatalytic chemistry of hydrogen, water, oxygen, carbon monoxide, alcohols, aldehydes, ketones and carboxylic acids on TiO2 surfaces. We focused this review mainly on the rutile TiO2(110) surface, but some results on the rutile TiO2(011), anatase TiO2(101) and (001) surfaces are also discussed. These studies provided fundamental insights into surface photocatalysis as well as stimulated new investigations in this exciting field. At the end of this review, we have discussed how these studies can help us to develop new photocatalysis models.

1. Introduction
The seminal work of photocatalyic water splitting on the TiO2 electrode by Honda and Fujishima1 attracted great interest in the field of renewable energy, given the limited fossil resources and their pollution to the environment during utilization. Great progress has been made in solar energy conversion and environmental remediation by making use of TiO2 heterogeneous photocatalysis.2–10 In addition, fundamental studies targeted at understanding the photocatalysis mechanism at the molecular level have also attracted growing attention.11–22 Investigation using the combination of ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) based surface science techniques such as ensemble-averaging desorption/photonic/electronic spectroscopy and especially atomic-resolved scanning probe microscopy, and well characterized single crystal model catalysts provides key insight into the underlying mechanism of heterogeneous photocatalysis.
The rutile TiO2 (r-TiO2)(110) surface (Fig. 1A), one of the most extensively studied metal oxide surfaces, has become a prototype for surface chemistry research. The structure of r-TiO2(110) has been very well understood. On the surface, fivefold coordinated Ti4+ ions (Ti5c) and twofold coordinated bridge O2− ions (Ob) run alternatively along the [001] azimuth. Reduction leads to the creation of surface bridging oxygen vacancies (Ov) and subsurface Ti3+ interstitials (Tiint), which contribute to the band gap states. In addition to r-TiO2(110), the structures of r-TiO2(011) and anatase TiO2 (a-TiO2)(101) surfaces have also been investigated, though less extensively. The most stable structure of r-TiO2(011) is (2 × 1) reconstructured. The structure of r-TiO2(011)-(2 × 1) as suggested by X-ray diffraction and density functional theory (DFT) calculations23,24 are shown in Fig. 1B. Different from r-TiO2(110), inequivalent types of under-coordinated Ti and O atoms exit, namely the valley Ti5c, ridge Ti5c, top Ob and bridge Ob. The top Ob atoms are displayed in a zig-zag style, such that they shade the ridge Ti5c sites severely. Missing of the top Ob atoms creates Ov. The saw tooth structure of a-TiO2(101) is also shown in Fig. 1C. The most prominent feature of this surface structure, in comparison with other surfaces, is the absence of surface oxygen vacancies.25

In this article, we will provide a rather complete review on the recent progress in the photocatalytic chemistry of hydrogen, water, oxygen, carbon monoxide, alcohols, aldehydes, ketones and carboxylic acids on TiO2 single crystals, mostly on r-TiO2 surfaces. Since the knowledge of the adsorption state is the prerequisite to understand the photocatalytic chemistry on surfaces, we will describe the detailed adsorption behavior of the adorbates firstly, and then discuss the photochemistry. Furthermore, the current challenges in experimental photocatalysis studies will be discussed. From the systematic studies of photocatalysis of methanol, water and other molecules on r-TiO2(110) under vacuum conditions, as well as similar observations in solution, a photocatalysis model based on nonadiabatic dynamics and ground state surface reactions has been proposed and will be discussed in detail, which demonstrates the importance of surface dynamics in photocatalysis. Finally, we will discuss the possible directions for future studies on TiO2 photocatalysis.
2. Hydrogen on r-TiO2(110)
Photocatalytic hydrogen production is the core issue in TiO2 heterogeneous photocatalysis. How hydrogen molecules are produced over TiO2 surfaces is an intriguing question. Investigation of the interaction between hydrogen and TiO2 would provide some clues for understanding the mechanism of molecular hydrogen production.
While TiO2 surfaces do not interact strongly with molecular hydrogen,26–30 atomic hydrogen readily adsorbs at the basic sites, for example, bridging oxygen (Ob) atoms on TiO2 surfaces, generating surface hydroxyls.31 Li et al. reported a barrier higher than 1 eV for H diffusion along the Ob rows of r-TiO2(110).32 Assisted by adsorbates at Ti5c, Zhang et al. suggested that the diffusion of H atoms across the Ob rows is feasible at room temperature (RT).33–35 Some researchers insisted that H adatoms remain on the surface of r-TiO2(110),36–38 but the diffusion of these adsorbates into the bulk has also been proposed for r-TiO2(110),39–41 r-TiO2(011)42 and a-TiO2(101).43 In addition, existence of Ti–H species on r-TiO2(110) has also been suggested.28,31,39,44
Even though bridging hydroxyls (OHb) on r-TiO2(110)-(1 × 1) are thought to be photo-inactive,38,45 photoinduced desorption of surface hydroxyls on r-TiO2(011)-(2 × 1) has been directly imaged by Tao and co-workers (Fig. 2).42 After 90 minute UV irradiation, the hydroxyl features on this surface were completely removed without the appearance of Ov. The author thus inferred that H atoms were photodesorbed as hydrogen rather than abstracting the lattice oxygen to produce water. Further photo-stimulated desorption (PSD) and time-of-flight mass spectroscopy (TOF-MS) measurements are required to identify desorption species and the final state distribution. Different from the photo-inactive surface hydroxyls, Wu and co-workers discovered the photocatalytic H2 production from Ti–H species on r-TiO2(110).46 They naturally proposed a hole-mediated hydrogen production mechanism based on the negatively charged Ti–H predicted by DFT calculations.

3. Water on r-TiO2(110) and a-TiO2(101)
Water chemistry and photochemistry on metal oxide surfaces are of great significance in solar to chemical energy conversion.1 The adsorption of water on r-TiO2(110) has been extensively investigated. Although the spontaneous dissociation at Ov sites has been well established,35,47–50 the exact adsorption state at the Ti5c sites remains unresolved.11,12,51–53 Coexistence of molecular and dissociative adsorption of water on r-TiO2(011)-(2 × 1) has also been reported by Beck and Valentin et al.54,55 On the a-TiO2(101) surface, He and co-workers found that monomer water adsorbed molecularly at the Ti5c sites and showed a local ordered superstructure due to the charge rearrangement at the water–anatase TiO2 interface.56 Chemisorption and tip induced dissociation of water at Ti3+ related point defects on a-TiO2(001)-(1 × 4) surface at 80 K have recently been reported by Wang et al.57
So far, there are only a few photochemistry studies of water on TiO2 surfaces, which is largely due to the low photochemical activity of water on these surfaces. One example for photocatalytic decomposition of water on r-TiO2(110) in UHV was reported by Tan et al. (Fig. 3).58 Scanning tunnel microscopy (STM) images showed that the O–H bond was cleaved under UV irradiation, generating OHb, while the most part of the remaining terminal hydroxyls (OHt) escaped into vacuum. However, the dissociation probability was only about 4% after the surface was irradiated for two hours. In addition, the remaining OHt on the surface will not further dissociate to produce O atoms under UV irradiation. By comparing the tip electron injection induced water dissociation where only terminal hydroxyls (OHt) or oxygen adatoms (Oa) remained at the original adsorption sites and no OHbs were observed, Tan and co-workers proposed a hole oxidized rather than electron reduced dissociation of water during the photocatalyzed splitting of water on r-TiO2(110). However, technically, this is still not full cycle water splitting reaction because no O2 evolution reaction occurs.

Even in real TiO2 catalytic systems without additives (such as sacrificial reagents, metals, cations, and anions), in most cases almost no O2 has been detected on TiO2. Thus, the O2 evolution mechanism on TiO2 has attracted enormous attention, and contradicting mechanisms have been proposed by different researchers.59–62 In an earlier study, Wilson62 speculated that the surface state may act as a possible intermediate of the O evolution. Salvador et al.60,61 pointed out that the surface OH radicals may serve as the initiation step of the O2 evolution by using photogenerated holes. Later, Nakamura and coworkers63,64 have investigated primary intermediates of oxygen photoevolution reaction at the TiO2 (rutile)/aqueous solution interface using photoluminescence (PL) and in situ multiple internal reflection infrared (MIRIR) absorption measurements. They illustrated that O2 evolution is initiated by a nucleophilic attack of a H2O molecule on a photo-generated hole at a surface lattice O site to form a [Ti–OOH–Ti] intermediate, but not by oxidation of a surface OH group by the hole. In addition, other water oxidation mechanisms on TiO2 were also proposed.65–70 Thus far, no consensus has been achieved on the exact mechanism of water oxidation.
4. Oxygen on r-TiO2(110) and a-TiO2(101)
Oxygen (O2) is usually present in the photo-oxidation of organic pollutants and photocatalytic splitting of water over TiO2. In addition, O2 may act as an electron scavenger, thus facilitating the photoexcited electron–hole separation process.2–4,71,72 The crucial role that O2 plays in photo-oxidation have stimulated extensive studies of the interaction between O2 and TiO2 which are of both fundamental and applicable significance.
4.1 Adsorption of oxygen on r-TiO2(110) and a-TiO2(101)
Chemical adsorption of O2 on TiO2, which is both coverage- and temperature-dependent, required charge transfer from the surface to the substrate. The charges are usually introduced by point defects such as surface Ovs and subsurface Tiint.22,73–79 This is the reason why O2 adsorbed only physically (desorbing below 75 K) on stoichiometric r-TiO2(110).80 At elevated adsorption temperatures (above 150 K), spontaneous dissociation of O2 at Ovs has been well established. An O2 molecule healed an Ov, leaving another Oa at the neighboring Ti5c sites.49,75,81–84 Aside from the dissociation at Ovs, Besenbacher et al. discovered another channel for O2 dissociation, i.e., splitting of O2 at Ti5c sites, producing Oa pairs, which was proposed to be facilitated by the excess charge transfer from the subsurface Ti interstitials.81,83
Despite the spontaneous dissociation of O2 at both Ov and Ti5c sites at elevated temperatures, molecular adsorption has also been investigated with temperatures below 100 K. O2 adsorbed preferentially at Ov sites in this temperature range.85–88 Temperature programmed desorption (TPD) experiments performed by Henderson et al. showed that chemisorbed O2 desorbs at around 410 K with first order kinetics.73 Kimmel and Petrik reported that the saturation coverage of chemisorbed O2 is twice the Ov concentration, which meant 2 O2 per Ov (2 O2/Ov).85 Based on the TPD and electron stimulated desorption (ESD) results, they proposed a tetraoxygen species when the initial 2 O2/Ov structure was annealed between 200 and 400 K. This finding was consistent with the result of an earlier calculation by Pillay et al.,89 which showed that the O42− structure was more stable by 0.6–0.9 eV than 2 O2−. Site specific adsorption of O2 on r-TiO2(110) has been investigated using high resolution STM by Diebold, Lyubinetsky and Wang's research groups.86–88 Molecularly adsorbed O2 at both Ov and Ti5c sites became dissociated (Fig. 4), driven by the STM tip.87 Chemisorbed O2 at Ov was invisible. Since Ov appeared as bright spots on the dark bridging oxygen row in the empty state STM, one can easily see the difference before (Fig. 4A(a)) and after (Fig. 4A(b)) O2 exposure, and molecularly adsorbed O2 at Ti5c displayed as even brighter spots on the bright Ti5c rows. To retain the chemisorbed structure, mild tunneling conditions should be chosen. For example, Fig. 4A(b) was taken at V = 0.8 V and I = 3 pA, while Fig. 4B(b) was acquired at V = 0.3 V and I = 1 pA. At higher voltage and current (1.5 V and 3 pA in Fig. 4A(c), 0.6 V and 3 pA in Fig. 4B(c)), chemisorbed O2 was dissociated. The dissociation of an O2 molecule at an Ov resulted in the appearance of an Oa on top of the Ti5c site adjacent to the original Ov, while that at Ti5c lead to an Oa pair at the Ti5c row.

The charge state of the chemisorbed O2 species is a crucial property, which affects the related chemistry. Peroxo (O2−),27,73,81,89–92 superoxo (O22−)77,89,92–94 and tetraoxygen (O42−)85,89 have all been suggested for O2 adsorption on r-TiO2(110). For example, using quantum-chemical, ab initio periodic Hartree–Fock calculations, Lare-Castells and co-workers found that O2− was the most stable O2 species adsorbed at the defect sites of r-TiO2(110).90 Based on the Ov to O2 charge transfer and in the absence of magnetic moments, Tilocca and Selloni proposed the O22− like species using the first-principles molecular dynamics approach.79 Changing the number of chemisorbed O2 per Ov, Pillay et al. calculated the structure, bonding and energetics of these oxygen species and proposed a tetraoxygen structure, i.e., O42−,89 which was consistent with the experimental result by Kimmel and Petrik.85 Direct spectroscopic investigation of the charge state of chemisorbed O2 on r-TiO2(110) has been performed by Henderson et al.73,93 These studies found that a new loss feature at 2.8 eV appeared at the expense of the Ti 3d derived defect states in electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) spectra. Examination of the loss feature at 2.8 eV, however, gave rise to different conclusions in ref. 73 and 93. The loss feature was assigned to O2− in ref. 73 and O22− species in ref. 93, respectively. The fact that no consensus has been reached thus far indicates the complexity of O2 adsorption on TiO2.
O2 adsorption on the a-TiO2(101) surface has also been investigated.22,95–103 Due to the absence of surface Ov on a-TiO2(101),25 subsurface Ovs are responsible for the charge transfer from this TiO2 substrate to O2.22 DFT calculations by Aschauer et al. suggested that the most stable species varied from O2− to O22−, as the O2 coverage increased from below 1 O2 per defect to above 1.5O2 per defect.96 Combined STM and DFT calculations carried out by Setvin and co-workers showed that O22− was transformed into an O2− by reacting with a subsurface Ov and further placed in an anion surface lattice, generating a bridging oxygen dimmer.101 Chemisorption and tip induced dissociation of O2 at Ti3+ related point defects on a-TiO2(001)-(1 × 4) surface at 80 K have recently been reported by Wang et al.57 At RT, O2 was still adsorbed molecularly at these point defects, but became dissociated at higher temperature.
4.2 Photochemistry of oxygen on r-TiO2(110)
Photochemistry of O2 on r-TiO2(110) has been extensively studied using photostimulated desorption (PSD)93,104–110 and photoinduced dissociation.111–115 Yates' group have systematically studied the PSD of O2 from TiO2(110) and built a hole mediated desorption model,13,16,116 which consisted of band gap excitation, diffusion of holes to the surface, trapping of holes at the surface, and finally the transfer of positively charged holes to the anion O2, leading to desorption (reaction (1)). O2(a)− + h+ → O2(gas)(1) Lu et al.104,105 discovered two chemisorption states of O2 on a reduced r-TiO2(110), of which one state could assist the photooxidation of CO while the other could not. The finding of two different O2 adsorption states was consistent with the velocity distribution measurements using time-of-flight (TOF) by Sporleder et al.110 Coverage-dependent O2 PSD has been further quantitatively investigated by Petrik and Kimmel (Fig. 5).113 On a reduced r-TiO2(110) with 0.08 ± 0.01 ML Ov, adsorption of 18O2 at 28 K was followed by a subsequent TPD to 100 K (squares in Fig. 5). Thereafter, 300 s PSD was performed at 28 K (triangles in Fig. 5). No 18O2 TPD signal was detected until the saturated chemisorption (2 O2/Ov85) was reached, since ramping to 100 K could only remove the physisorbed species.80,117 The increase of the 18O2 PSD signal with initial 18O2 coverage could be fitted by two straight lines with slopes of 0.14 and 0.57 below 1 O2 per Ov (1 O2/Ov) and between 1 O2/Ov and 2 O2/Ov, respectively. These authors argued the increase of the slope resulted from the sharing of the excess electrons of the chemisorbed O2, which meant that the charge state was more O22− like before all the Ov sites were occupied and favored O2− which was the reagent of the hole mediated O2 desorption thereafter. Photodesorption of O2 at Ti5c sites has recently been observed by Wang et al. using high resolution STM (HRSTM) (Fig. 6A).114 Therefore, reaction (1) shown above could be revised as follows (reaction (2)): O2−/Ti5c + h+ → O2(gas)(2)

Besides photostimulated desorption, UV light induced dissociation of O2 on r-TiO2(110) has also been examined.111–115Fig. 7 summarizes the quantitative analysis of the chemisorbed, photodesorbed and photodissociated oxygen species by Petrik and Kimmel using a combined TPD and PSD study.111θrem, θX, θdiss stood for the coverage of O2 that retained on the surface, remained undissociated, became dissociated after UV irradiation, respectively. θocc and θ2nd represented the amount of occupied and unoccupied sites after exposure to UV light respectively, where the latter was determined by the TPD measurements after a second O2 exposure following the UV irradiation. In this work, the authors proposed an electron mediated mechanism of photoinduced dissociation at Ov sites (reaction (3)), O22−/Ov + h+ → Ob2− + O−/Ti5c(3)which was complemented by the hole mediated photodesorption. The increase of the photodesorption fraction and the decrease of the photodissociation fraction (Fig. 7) with the initial O2 coverage are consistent with this proposed mechanism. The amount of O2− increased as the coverage of O2 was bigger than that of Ov. Therefore, enhanced photodesorption and depressed photodissociation are expected. Petrik and Kimmel's further work using isotope labeling showed that although there were chemisorbed O2 species which were photoinactive, they could exchange atoms with physisorbed O2.112 The exchange rate reached a maxima if the O2 covered r-TiO2(110) surface was preheated to 350 K. Even though the exact structure of this oxygen species remained unknown, the authors proposed two possible candidates, i.e., O2 at Ov sites and tetraoxygen. O2 photodissociation on TiO2(110) was also investigated by Wang et al.114 Using HRSTM, photoinduced desorption at Ti5c sites (Fig. 6A) and photoinduced dissociation at Ov sties (Fig. 6B) have been directly observed. While complementary oxidative and reductive reaction in photocatalysis are expected to proceed at substantial and balanced rates, the observed kinetics of hole mediated photodesorption and electron mediated photodissociation in this study differed significantly from each other (Fig. 8). If the diffusion rate of charge carriers is the rate-determining step of the reactions, photodissociation will be faster than photodesorption of molecular O2 in this system since holes diffuse more slowly than electrons.13,18 This is obviously not the case in the current study. There must be other factors (e.g., the dynamics of the charge transfer processes and the barrier of reactions) governing the reaction kinetics.

5. Carbon monoxide on r-TiO2(110)
The interaction between CO and TiO2 is also of great importance in a variety of applications, ranging from low temperature CO oxidation118 to CO hydrogenation and water–gas shift reaction.119 CO bound weakly on the stoichiometric r-TiO2(110) surface due to the weak electron donation ability of the substrate and the weak back donation of the Ti ions,80 which was in accord with an ab initio molecular orbital calculation.120 X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and EELS investigation by Gopel and co-workers suggested that Ovs were the adsorption sites for CO,27,121 which was consistent with some theoretical work.29,120 Whereas TPD examination carried out by Linsebigler et al. showed that Ti5c sites were favored, and this conclusion was supported by many other theoretical calculations.122–128 STM studies by Zhao et al. discovered that though Ovs could assist the diffusion of CO across the Ob rows, they themselves and their nearest Ti5c sites were not suitable for CO adsorption at 80 K.129 Instead, the next nearest Ti5c sites were the most favored sites. For other Ti5c sites, the adsorption probability decreases with the distance between Ti5c and Ov. The authors suggested that the delocalized distribution of the excess charge on the r-TiO2(110) surface130 should be responsible for the CO adsorption behavior observed. Infrared reflection adsorption spectroscopy (IRAS) studies on the adsorption geometry of CO as a function of coverage by Petrik and Kimmel showed that CO adsorbed with its axis oriented perpendicularly to the r-TiO2(110) surface on top of Ti5c sites below 1 ML, and afterwards it bound to the Ob atoms with the molecular axis along the [10] azimuth.
By means of PSD, Yates and co-workers observed a CO2 signal together with the O2 one upon UV irradiation on reduced r-TiO2(110) covered with O2 and CO at 105 K.131,132 A threshold of the photon energy of 3.1 eV, which corresponded to the band gap of rutile, was found to initiate the surface reaction, suggesting that the reaction is a substrate mediated photooxidation. The reaction could only proceed on reduced r-TiO2(110), indicating that chemisorbed O2 rather than dissociated O2 was involved in the photooxidation process.
Later on, Petrik and Kimmel reexamined photooxidation of CO on r-TiO2(110).133 Besides CO2 and O2, CO was also detected by PSD in the presence of chemisorbed O2. The yield of all these desorption products was similar. Both O2 coverage dependent and isotope labeling studies supported that O2 chemisorbed at Ovs was responsible for this photooxidation reaction, while that at Ti5c sites was likely inactive. Desorption of CO2 was peaked at 40 degrees with respect to the surface normal along the [10] azimuth. Such an angular distribution of product desorption indicated a specific transition state which was consistent with theoretical prediction.127,134 The authors also proposed a model (Fig. 9) for the photooxidation of CO on O2 covered reduced r-TiO2(110). No intermediate was detected by IRAS in the photooxidation of CO over r-TiO2(110).135 Petrik and Kimmel found that the reaction kinetics obtained with millisecond time resolution is deviated from that of one step reaction mechanism; based on this, they proposed that this reaction involved multiple reaction steps, and both electron-mediated and hole-mediated reactions were needed.136

Using first principles calculations, Raina Wanbayor et al.137 found that positive charge on the a-TiO2(101) surface increases the adsorption energy of CO, allowing its conversion to CO2. This hole-assisted CO → CO2 conversion can be spontaneous, and would be endothermic without the presence of a hole. With these results, the authors proposed that oxidation of CO on the a-TiO2(001) surface could be an efficient photocatalytic process.
Using IRAS, Xu and co-workers compared the cross-section of photooxidation of CO on r-TiO2(110) and a-TiO2(101) quantitatively.138 As seen in Fig. 10a, the vibration feature of physisorbed CO2 at 2340 cm−1 increased with the irradiation (hν = 3.40 eV) time, while that of CO chemisorbed on top of Ti5c at around 2180 cm−1 declined apparently on a-TiO2(101) which was held at 100 K in the presence of O2. Based on the IR data, the calculated cross-section (Fig. 10b) of this photoreaction was 2 × 10−17 cm2 on a-TiO2(101), which was one order of magnitude larger than that on r-TiO2(110) under identical experimental conditions. Using the contactless transient photocondutance method, the electron–hole lifetime is determined to be about an order of magnitude larger for anatase than for rutile. Thus, these authors proposed that the longer lifetime of electron–hole pairs in anatase facilitates the translocation of the photon-excited electrons and holes from the bulk to the surface, where the photochemical reactions take place.

6. Alcohols on r-TiO2(110) and a-TiO2(101)
Photocatalytic reactions of alcohols, especially methanol and ethanol, on TiO2 have attracted great interest in recent years due to their related application in H2 production, oxidative remediation of organic wastes, and biomass conversion to fuels and useful synthetic chemicals. Since surface science studies on single crystal surfaces under UHV conditions could provide fundamental insights into these important processes, both thermal chemistry and photochemistry on TiO2 especially the r-TiO2(110) surface have been investigated with a variety of experimental and theoretical approaches.33,34,45,108,139–184 In this section, we will provide a detailed review on both the thermal chemistry and photochemistry of alcohols on TiO2 surfaces. Studies of methanol (CH3OH) will be described first, followed by discussion on other aliphatic alcohols.
6.1 Methanol on TiO2 surfaces

6.1.1 Adsorption of methanol on TiO2 surfaces. 
On reduced r-TiO2(110), TPD spectra of CH3OH yielded five prominent features at 150, 165, 295, 350 and 480 K.145 The 150 and 165 K peaks were assigned to multilayer desorption; the feature at 295 K was assigned to the desorption of molecularly adsorbed CH3OH on Ti5c sites, and the broad tail around 480 K was attributed to the recombinative desorption of dissociated CH3OH at Ovs. A small 350 K shoulder was also observed; Henderson et al. suggested that this shoulder was due to CH3OH dissociated at non-defective sites of the surface, probably Ti5c, on the basis of similar behavior of the 350 K and 480 K peaks following electron bombardment.185 However, no obvious 350 K shoulder was detected in recent TPD studies of CH3OH on reduced r-TiO2(110) with gentle surface treatment.178 Therefore, the origin of the small 350 K shoulder of methanol TPD on reduced r-TiO2(110) is not clear.
Petek et al.150,151 provided some indirect evidence that part of CH3OH adsorbed at the Ti5c sites dissociatively. Using two-photon photoemission spectroscopy (2PPE), an empty wet electron state at about 2.3 ± 0.2 eV above the Fermi level (EF) was detected on both reduced and stoichiometric r-TiO2(110). However, in the case of H2O, this excited state could only be observed on reduced r-TiO2(110) surfaces with a simultaneous presence of monolayer water and OHb (resulting from spontaneous dissociation of water at Ovs49), and the electron distribution in this state was reported to encompass several adsorbate H sites.186 While on the water covered stoichiometric r-TiO2 surface, this state was totally absent. By analogy with the properties of the excited state at the H2O/r-TiO2(110) interface, those authors argued that methanol on the r-TiO2(110) surface is partially dissociated.
In a high resolution STM study, Zhang et al.33 found that CH3OH dissociated at the Ov sites spontaneously to form methoxy (CH3O) and hydroxyl on the primarily neighboring Ob sites. Further investigation showed that molecular methanol can diffuse along the Ti5c rows at RT, indicating that CH3OH is not dissociated at these sites. Theoretical work regarding CH3OH adsorption on r-TiO2(110) was also carried out.142,154,160 Most results indicated that the molecularly adsorbed state of CH3OH was nearly iso-energetic to the dissociated state with the former being slightly more stable, and the energy barrier for the transformation between these two states was quite low. These results are consistent with STM observation at both liquid nitrogen temperature163 and RT,33 although it is not clear whether this good agreement will stand at high surface coverage. Theoretical calculations showed that dissociative adsorption of CH3OH on Ov sites is thermodynamically more favorable than molecular adsorption by 0.5 eV,154 which is also consistent with TPD and STM experimental results.


6.1.2 Photocatalytic chemistry of methanol on TiO2 surfaces. 
Methanol/TiO2 is an important model system because of a remarkable enhancement of photocatalytic hydrogen production from a water–methanol mixture over TiO2,187 the potential applications of CH3OH in photocatalytic selective oxidation,188 environmental photocatalysis,189 and photocatalytic reforming reactions.188 Meanwhile, as one of the simplest organic compounds, CH3OH is often chosen as a probe for the fundamental studies of photocatalytic chemistry on oxide surfaces.
Recently, methanol on the r-TiO2(110) system was investigated using 2PPE, STM and DFT calculations by Zhou et al.163 They also observed an excited state at about 2.4 eV above EF by irradiating a saturated layer of CH3OH (0.77 ML).169 In this work, a 1 ML covered r-TiO2(110) surface was irradiated with 400 nm femtosecond laser pulse, very similar to the previous 2PPE measurement on this surface,151 where the unoccupied excited state was assigned to be an intrinsic “wet electron state” on the CH3OH covered r-TiO2(110) surface. However, Zhou et al.'s results showed that the excited resonance peak was absent at the beginning of laser irradiation (Fig. 11A), suggesting that this excitation does not exist initially for the CH3OH covered r-TiO2(110) surface. The excited state signal, however, increased with the laser irradiation time and saturated after a 15 minute irradiation, accompanied by a peak shift towards lower energy. This interesting result unambiguously demonstrated that the excited resonance state, which was located at 2.4 eV above EF, was a photoinduced surface state rather than a wet electron state that was intrinsically present on the CH3OH/r-TiO2(110) surface. The lifetime of the excited state was measured to be ∼20 fs by time-resolved two-pulse correlation.175 This value was in agreement with Petek's result.151

In order to understand this photoinduced process, Zhou et al.163 also employed STM (acquired at 80 K) to reveal the nature of the photochemical changes detected by 2PPE (Fig. 12). Fig. 12A shows an STM image of the bare r-TiO2(110) surface with about 4% Ovs (labeled as “BBOv” in the figure). The bright and dark lines corresponded to the Ti5c and Ob rows respectively, while the bright spots on the dark lines represented the Ovs. After adsorption of 0.02 ML CH3OH, most of the CH3OH molecules adsorbed on the Ti5c sites and appeared as clear bright round spots (Fig. 12B). These bright round spots could move along the Ti5c row as a whole or desorb driven by the STM tip, implying that CH3OH molecules adsorbed on the Ti5c sites molecularly first, which was consistent with previous STM results.33 After 10 minute UV (<400 nm) irradiation, the majority of the bright round spots became elongated (marked by black arrows in Fig. 12C). By manipulating one of these elongated species (labeled “m1” in Fig. 12C) with the STM tip, the species was then separated into two components. One of the components left on the Ob site was confirmed to be an OHb group.190 This clearly suggested that the CH3OH molecule after UV irradiation was dissociated. Similar STM experiments using >400 nm light have also been carried out. No evidence for CH3OH dissociation was found, suggesting that the dissociation of CH3OH was a substrate mediated photocatalytic process.

Given the coverage difference in the 2PPE and STM experiments, Zhou and coworkers also performed additional 2PPE measurements at lower surface coverage. The irradiation dependence of the excited resonance state was found to be similar for the CH3OH coverage at 0.77, 0.39 and 0.12 ML, suggesting that the photochemical change is not dependent on the CH3OH coverage, although the reaction kinetics seems to be dependent on the coverage. Therefore, the STM and 2PPE results could be directly related. The photocatalyzed dissociation of CH3OH imaged by STM suggested that the photoinduced excited state detected by 2PPE comes from photodecomposition of CH3OH on this surface. DFT calculations of the electronic structure are also consistent with experimental results. Molecularly adsorbed CH3OH had little effect on the density of states (DOS) of Ti 3d due to the relatively weak interaction between CH3OH and Ti5c, however, the adsorbate–substrate interaction became much stronger when CH3OH deprotonated. The strong interaction between CH3O and the Ti5c ion led to the appearance of a new band, which was centered at 2.5 eV above the EF, in agreement with the 2PPE measurement. Since both the initial state (band gap state) and the intermediated state in the 2PPE measurement were of Ti 3d character, the transition between the two states was forbidden in the octahedral field. However, due to the presence of the surface, the octahedra became distorted, thus allowing weak d → d transition.
Zhou et al. suggested that photodissociation of CH3OH goes through O–H bond cleavage, as illustrated in the reaction: CH3OH/Ti5c + Ob + hν → CH3O/Ti5c + OHb(4) Since the excited state was associated with the dissociation of CH3OH, the irradiation time dependent excited resonance signal illustrated essentially the kinetics of photocatalyzed dissociation of CH3OH on r-TiO2(110). The integrated time dependent excited resonance signal (Fig. 11B) could not be described using a single exponential model, while a fractal-like kinetics model (eqn (5))191,192 simulated the data well. (5)where k0 is the rate at t = 1, and h is equal to 1-ds/2, where ds is the spectral dimension of the heterogeneous reaction media. A previous study suggested that the fractal-like kinetics of photochemistry on the TiO2 surface can attributed to the trapping and detrapping of charge carriers.109
As a model photoreaction, photocatalyzed decomposition of fully deuterated methanol (CD3OD) on TiO2 has been used by Zhou et al.168 to investigate the differences in the photocatalytic activities of the oxidized and reduced r-TiO2(110) surfaces. The excited resonance state at about 5.5 eV was observed by 2PPE on both surfaces covered with CD3OD, whereas the rise times of the excited resonance signal on these two surfaces were significantly different (Fig. 13). It took 37 seconds for the excited resonance signal to reach 90% of its maximum level on the reduced surface, whereas on the stoichiometric one, the rise time was 640 seconds. The varying photoactivity was attributed to the concentration difference of point defects on these two surfaces. The amount of both surface and subsurface defects on the reduced r-TiO2(110) surface was significantly larger than those on the stoichiometric surface. They suggested that the surface and/or subsurface defects could accelerate methanol photolysis on the r-TiO2(110) surface. Unfortunately, it was difficult to characterize whether the surface defects or subsurface defects play a more important role in the acceleration of methanol photolysis on r-TiO277,193 due to the difficulty in quantitative characterization of the density of the subsurface defects. The observed higher photoactivity on the reduced TiO2 surface was consistent with improved photocatalytic hydrogen production via self Ti3+ doping, probably due to the enhanced light absorption.194

As discussed above, dissociation of the CH3O–H bond occurred on CH3OH covered reduced and stoichiometric r-TiO2(110) surfaces under UV irradiation. However, both 2PPE and STM methods were not able to identify the photochemical species on the surface. Recently, CH3OH photolysis on r-TiO2(110) has been studied using the TPD method by Henderson et al.171,172,178 They proposed that the adsorption state of CH3OH was crucial to its photochemistry on TiO2. By co-adsorption of CH3OH and O2 on r-TiO2(110) to control the thermal dissociation of CH3OH, CH3O is formed on TiO2(110) from the reaction of molecularly adsorbed CH3OH and an O adatom, CH3OH(a) + Oa → CH3O(a) + OHt(6)where OHt is a thermal hydroxyl group on a Ti5c site. Henderson et al.171 concluded that CH3O, rather than molecular CH3OH, was the photoactive species in photochemical reactions of CH3OH on TiO2. Their results also suggested that formaldehyde (CH2O) was produced from photochemistry of thermally dissociated CH3OH on the Ti5c sites, which was initiated by defects, coadsorbed O adatoms or OHt groups, but not by Ov sites (under UHV conditions), and not from photodissociation of molecular CH3OH on the Ti5c sites.
Guo et al. have extended the investigation of CH3OH photolysis systematically also using the TPD method, in combination with laser surface photocatalysis. They investigated the photo-induced dissociation of partially deuterated methanol (CD3OH) on r-TiO2(110) using 400 nm laser irradiation without coadsorbed O2.176Fig. 14A shows TPD spectra collected at a mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) of 33 (CD2OH+) after surfaces of r-TiO2(110) were dosed with 0.5 ML CD3OH and then irradiated using the laser for various durations. The observed CD3OH signal decreased monotonically with the laser irradiation time, suggesting that the CD3OH molecules adsorbed on the Ti5c sites of r-TiO2(110) were photocatalytically dissociated. Concomitant to the decrease of the CD3OH TPD peak, a new peak at 270 K appeared in the TPD spectra for m/z = 32 (CD2O+) and increased with laser irradiation time (Fig. 14B), corresponding to desorption of molecularly adsorbed CH2O from the Ti5c sites. The released H/D atoms transferred to the Ob sites were confirmed by the characteristic recombinative desorption of OHb from this surface around 460 K.195,196 The photodecomposition of CH3OH into CH2O and OHbs on TiO2(110) have recently also been directly observed using the high resolution STM technique by Wei et al.197
 Fig. 14  (A) Typical TPD spectra collected at m/z = 33 (CD2OH+) after 0.5 ML CD3OH was adsorbed on r-TiO2(110) at 110 K and irradiated at 400 nm for various times.

(B) Typical TPD spectra collected at m/z = 32 (CD2O+) following different laser irradiation times.

DFT calculations on the ground state potential energy surface showed that the O–H dissociation energy of CH3OH was slightly endoergic by only 0.03 eV, with a barrier of 0.25 eV. While, the dissociation energy of the second dissociation step (the C–H dissociation) to produce CH2O and H was highly endoergic (1.03 eV), and the barrier was also much higher (1.57 eV). The barrier for the reverse reaction was therefore 0.54 eV (Fig. 15). Similar energetics for the CH3OH/r-TiO2(110) model system have been reported by Lang et al.184 A recent study on the recombination of CH2O and Hb atoms by Mao et al.198 using 2PPE and STM suggested that the calculated energetics were reasonable. CH3OH at Ti5c sites could only be dissociated under UV irradiation (<400 nm) (spontaneous and tip induced (V = +1.25 V, I = 100 pA) dissociation of CH3OH at Ti5c sites were not observed). However, spontaneous and tip induced recombination of CH2O and Hb atoms were detected, suggesting the lower stability of the products and a high and low barrier for the forward (dissociation) and reverse (recombination) reaction, respectively. This was consistent with the calculation of the energetics for the CH3OH/r-TiO2(110) system.

Therefore, Guo and co-workers proposed that CD3OH was photodissociated into CD2O at Ti5c sites in a two-step process, leaving eventually H and D atoms on the Ob sites: (7) (8) These experimental results clearly demonstrated that photocatalytic CD3OH dissociation on r-TiO2(110) occurred on Ti5c sites rather than Ovs, and clarified the exact active photocatalytic site on this surface.
Photocatalyzed dissociation of methanol on r-TiO2(110) clearly provided a strategy to continuously vary the surface hydroxyls without affecting the subsurface defects. Mao et al. thus revisited the long standing issue of the origin of band gap states in r-TiO2(110) by exploring the correlation between the DOS of the band gap states and the concentration of surface hydroxyls prepared via CH3OH photodissociation.199 The intensity of band gap states measured by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) scaled linearly with surface hydroxyls characterized by TPD with a small intercept, suggesting that surface defects made a major contribution to the band gap states, which in turn indicates the importance of surface defects in changing the electronic structure of TiO2 which dictated the surface chemistry.
In addition to the formation of CH2O from CH3OH photocatalysis on r-TiO2(110), Guo et al.179 observed further photocatalytic oxidation to form methyl formate (HCOOCH3) with the 0.5 ML CH3OH covered r-TiO2(110) surface. As seen in Fig. 16, during the first 10 minutes of irradiation, the amount of CH2O formed rose rapidly to a maximum, while little HCOOCH3 was formed. Longer irradiation times lead to a steady decrease of the amount of CH2O and a concomitant increase of that of HCOOCH3. After 90 minutes of irradiation, very little CH2O remained on the surface. Thus, the formation of HCOOCH3 appeared to be directly correlated with the depletion of CH2O. Similar phenomena were also observed by Phillips et al.181 and Yuan et al.182

According to a series of thermal catalytic investigations on gas-phase dehydrogenation of CH3OH to HCOOCH3 over copper-based catalysts,200–202 Guo et al. suggested that HCOOCH3 was produced through cross-coupling of CH2O and CH3O:179 (9) While, Phillips et al.181 proposed that CH3O on Ti5c sites underwent photo-oxidation to form HCOOCH3 in a two-step process where the CH3O dissociated to form CH2O and a cross-coupling reaction involving a formyl (HCO) intermediate led to the formation of HCOOCH3: (10)
Recently, Lang and co-workers184 have investigated the two pathways mentioned above for CH3OH oxidation into HCOOCH3 on perfect r-TiO2(110) and defective r-TiO2(110) based on first-principles calculations. The huge difference in the energy barriers for HCO and hemiacetal production suggested that CH3OH oxidation on both surfaces facilely proceeded through the intermediate hemiacetal to produce HCOOCH3.
Photooxidation of CH3OH has recently been studied by Mao et al.203 to assess the relatively efficient photoactivity of r-TiO2(110)-(1 × 1) and r-TiO2(011)-(2 × 1), with the latter being reported to have higher activity towards photooxidation reactions.204,205 The reaction pathways were similar on these two surfaces. CH2O, HCOOCH3 have been detected. The most prominent difference of the photooxidation of CH3OH on these two surfaces came from the reaction kinetics. The reaction rate on r-TiO2(011)-(2 × 1) was only 42% of that on r-TiO2(110)-(1 × 1), contradicting with previous reports in aqueous environments where characterization of the TiO2 structure was difficult.204,205
The effect of the surface atomic structure on the activity of a crystal in heterogeneous reactions is known to be greatly related to the number of unsaturated coordinated atoms on the surface. The higher the percentage of unsaturated coordinated atoms, the more reactive the crystal is. The results obviously did not comply with this rule since the percentage of Ti5c was 100% on r-TiO2(011)-(2 × 1) and 50% on r-TiO2(110)-(1 × 1). In addition, this result was not in agreement with a previous electronic structure study which expected that the electron trapping and electron–hole separation on the r-TiO2(011)-(2 × 1) surface were more efficient than on the r-TiO2(110)-(1 × 1) surface, based on the higher binding energy of the band gap states of the former.206 Theoretical studies184,203 suggest that the rate determining step of photooxidation of CH3OH on both surfaces was the C–H bond cleavage, however, the barrier of this elementary step was 0.2 eV higher on r-TiO2(011)-(2 × 1) due to the distinct atomic configuration. They then tentatively linked the correlation between the photoactivity and the surface structure of TiO2.
As we can see from the above experimental studies, the photooxidation of CH3OH on r-TiO2(110) proceeded through multiple elementary reaction steps. After CH3OH dissociation, the dissociated H-atoms transferred to nearby Ob sites, prompting the question of how molecular hydrogen might be formed during CH3OH photocatalysis. Recent experimental investigation on the photocatalysis of CD3OD on r-TiO2(110) by Xu and co-workers45 suggested that molecular hydrogen (D2) was not formed from photoinduced recombination of dissociated D-atoms. Whereas, during the TPD process, D-atoms desorbed from the surface in the form of D2O and D2 (Fig. 17). (11) (12)
 Fig. 17  (A) Typical TPD spectra collected at m/z = 20 (D2O+) after 0.5 ML CD3OH was adsorbed on r-TiO2(110) at 100 K and irradiated at 400 nm for various times., the peak (marked with *) slightly below 300 K is attributed to the dissociative ionization signal of molecular adsorbed CD3OD in the electron-impact ionizer and impurity of D2O in CD3OD. (B) Typical TPD spectra collected at m/z = 4(D2+) following different laser irradiation times at 400 nm; the peak (marked with *) slightly below 300 K is attributed to the dissociative ionization signal of molecular adsorbed CD3OD in the electron-impact ionizer.

Both D2O and D2 recombination signals increased with laser irradiation time, and the peaks gradually shift to lower temperature. Meanwhile, the desorption of D2 starting from ∼375 K, which is about 50 K higher than that of D2O, indicated that D2 desorption was more difficult than D2O desorption. The yields of these two products indicated that less than ∼7% of total D-atoms from CD3OD photolysis desorbed as D2, demonstrating that D2 formation is much less facile than D2O formation.
It is generally believed that the thermalization of charge carriers produced from UV irradiation of the TiO2 surface, as well as the relaxation to their respective band edges, occurs on the hundred-fs scale. As a result, photolysis on TiO2 is driven by separated electrons or holes that are energetically located at the band edges. The reaction rate will depend on the photon flux rather than the wavelength of the incident light.18 Gundlach and coworkers used 2PPE to track thermalization following electron injection from dyes adsorbed on r-TiO2(110).207–209 Fast initial decay of the 2PPE signal resulting from thermalization of the injected electron occurred on the 10 fs timescale. This result suggested that excess potential energy was lost to the lattice via strong coupling with phonon modes, thus reducing the potential advantage gained by the specificity in the absorption event. Xu and coworkers have tested this idea by measuring the initial dissociation rate of CH3OH on r-TiO2(110) with two irradiation wavelengths, 355 nm and 266 nm.210 Because CH3OH and CH2O may be desorbed by irradiation,176 monitoring the yields of the CH3OH reactant and the CH2O product was not the best approach to measure the product formation rate. Another major product from CH3OH dissociation on r-TiO2(110) was atomic H on the Ob sites, resulting from reactions (7) and (8). Due to the high adsorption energy, these products did not desorb easily by light. Upon heating, two bridging H atoms abstracted an Ob to form a H2O molecule, and then the H2Omolecules desorbed at around 500 K, leaving an Ov on the surface (reaction (11)).
Thus, monitoring H-atom production through desorption of H2O was the better way to measure the product formation rate as CH3OH underwent photocatalytic dissociation. As shown in Fig. 18, the initial rate of H2O production was found to be strongly dependent on photon energy, with the initial rate being about two orders of magnitude higher at 266 nm than at 355 nm. This striking result was clearly in conflict with the traditional electron–hole photocatalysis model that charge carriers in TiO2 rapidly thermalize to their respective band edges via strong coupling with phonon modes first, which predicted that photocatalysis should not depend strongly on the photon energy. These authors speculated that reactions maybe occur in the ground electronic state, where increased converted photon energy should be more efficient in driving chemical reactions. The new phenomenon reported by Xu and coworkers challenges the traditional electron–hole photocatalysis model, and calls for the development of a more sophisticated surface photocatalysis model that incorporates the effect of photon energy, which is expected to enhance the understanding of fundamental processes in photocatalysis.

Kavan and colleagues211 found that anatase is the more photoactive polymorph for the photocatalytic production of hydrogen from H2O oxidation and is the only polymorph that can produce hydrogen without applying an external bias. However, the availability of large size and high quality single crystal anatase is very limited. As yet, only a few experimental studies212,213 of CH3OH chemistry on a well-defined a-TiO2(101) surface have been done. On the reduced a-TiO2(101) surface, five desorption features observed at 142 K, 188 K, 270 K, 410 K, and 650 K are observed in TPD spectra of CH3OH (Fig. 19).212,213 By analogy with the behavior of CH3OH on r-TiO2(110), the 142 and 188 K peaks are assigned to multilayer desorption, the feature at 270 K is assigned to the desorption of molecularly adsorbed CH3OH on Ti5c sites, and the broad tail around 410 K is attributed to the recombinative desorption of dissociated CH3OH on defect sites. The 650 K peak is likely due to CH3O disproportionation at the Ti5c sites, as on the r-TiO2(110) surface.171 (13) (14)

Recently, Xu and coworkers213 have done some preliminary studies of CH3OH photolysis on a-TiO2(101) using the TPD method. As shown in Fig. 20, the 650 K peak in mass 30 and 31 TPD decreased rapidly after 5 seconds irradiation while the 300 K peak changed little implying that CH3O has a much higher reactivity than molecular CH3OH on this surface. Photocatalytic products, CH2O and HCOOCH3, have been detected with different laser irradiation times (Fig. 20B and C), implying that the photocatalytic mechanisms for the formation of these products are similar to that on the r-TiO2(110) surface.179 These authors have also detected dissociated H-atoms from photocatalysis of CH3OH on the a-TiO2(101) surface by collecting TPD spectra of H2O and H2 products (Fig. 21A and B). Whereas, a rather sharp peak at m/z = 18 was observed near 260 K after different laser irradiation times, which was assigned to H2O desorption from Ti5c sites. No obvious H2O desorption signal was detected at higher temperature. Concomitant to the increase of the H2O TPD peak, a broad methyl radical feature stretching from 400–700 K was also detected at mass 15, maintaining the same increasing rate with that of H2O. Referring to the earlier theoretical work by Tilocca and Selloni,214 these authors suggest that the H2O TPD peak at 260 K is due to the following thermally driven exchange reaction, (15)

The same as D2 formation on r-TiO2(110), H2 formation from CH3OH photocatalysis on a-TiO2(101) may occur via photocatalytic dissociation of CH3OH followed by thermal recombination of H–Ob. The formation of molecular H2 and H2O were comparable on the a-TiO2(101) surface, indicating that the H2 formation process should be more efficient on the a-TiO2(101) surface than on the r-TiO2(110) surface.
Besides participating in the photochemical reaction directly, methanol and other organic adsorbates have also been usually treated as hole scavengers. By density functional studies, Cristiana Di Valentin et al.215 have shown that the surface dipole originated by molecular adsorption reduces the energy cost to form a hole at a surface lattice oxygen. The hole can then be trapped by the organic adsorbate if proton dissociation takes place. The scavenging power follows the trend glycerol > tert-butanol > iso-propanol > methanol > formic acid.

6.2 Ethanol photolysis
Compared to methanol, less studies have been done on ethanol (C2H5OH) chemistry and photochemistry on r-TiO2(110).139,147,149,156,158,165,166,170,174,216–218 Although the TPD profiles of C2H5OH are very similar to those of CH3OH, the adsorption state on Ti5c sites is different. As yet, no direct experimental evidence demonstrated that CH3OH dissociatively adsorbs on the Ti5c sites. However, the XPS study by Idriss et al.156 and the STM study by Hansen et al.165 showed that part of C2H5OH dissociated at Ti5c sites spontaneously to form ethoxy (C2H5O) and OHb on r-TiO2(110). The photochemistry of C2H5OH on the r-TiO2(110) surface was first investigated by Idriss et al.156,170 using XPS and TPD methods. These authors observed thermal conversion of adsorbed C2H5OH to acetaldehyde (CH3CHO) and ethylene (C2H4) during the TPD process after C2H5OH adsorption at 300 K. Upon UV excitation in the presence of O2, adsorbed ethanol on r-TiO2(110) reacts to produce acetaldehyde and then to carboxylates.
Recently, the photochemistry of C2H5OH on r-TiO2(110) has been re-studied using the TPD method by Ma et al. (Fig. 22).217 In the absence of O2, they illustrated that the photoinduced dehydrogenation of C2H5OH was similar to CH3OH photochemistry on r-TiO2(110), (16) (17)

Aside from the recombinative desorption of OHb to produce H2O at ∼500 K, another H2O desorption feature grew at about 250 K with UV irradiation, and was assigned to H2O species on Ti5c sites. As the H2O TPD peak at 250 K increases, a broad C2H4 TPD peak from 500–650 K via two possible reactions (18)219 and (19)139 appears at mass 26, in the same increasing rate with that of the H2O TPD peak, (18) (19)where C2H4 formation was the dominant process. Combined with earlier studies of C2H5OH on hydroxylated TiO2 powders,220–222 these authors suggests that the increased H2O desorption feature at 250 K was likely accomplished by the replacement of C2H5OH molecules and OHb to produce adsorbed H2O on Ti5c sites and bridging ethoxy, (20)
These authors also investigated photochemistry of C2H5OH on a new r-TiO2(110) sample and an old r-TiO2(110) sample having experienced hundreds of cycles of sputtering and annealing. Interestingly, on the new r-TiO2(110) sample, reaction (20) rarely occurs. The main difference between the two samples is the density of subsurface defects, which was much higher in the old sample. Thus, these authors speculated that subsurface defects may affect surface chemistry on r-TiO2(110) in a different way, compared to surface defects.
Photochemistry of 2-propanol on r-TiO2(110) has been investigated by Brinkley and Engel141,146 using TPD and molecular beam techniques. With a mixed beam of O2 and 2-propanol in a 7:1 ratio directed at the surface, when the light was switched on, intense signals associated with acetone and H2O products were detected using a mass spectrometer, both of which decayed very rapidly in a few seconds, and then kept constant until the light was switched off. The yields of acetone and H2O were approximately the same, indicating that one 2-propanol molecule reacted with an O2 molecule to form one acetone and one H2O molecule, and O2 was necessary for this photochemical process.
7. Aldehydes on r-TiO2(110)
Surface chemistry and photochemistry of aldehydes have been intensively studied motivated by both applied and fundamental reasons. Aldehydes may be used for the catalytic production of numerous useful synthetic chemicals. They are also atmospheric pollutants with potential carcinogenic effects, as well as additives and byproducts in the combustion of alcohols as automotive fuels.223 As a result, photocatalytic degradation of aldehydes, as a potential commercial technique to remove aldehydes from the environment, has attracted enormous scientific interest, leading to the extensive study of the thermal chemistry and photochemistry of aldehydes on r-TiO2(110).193,223–242 The photochemistry of CH3CHO is very similar to that of ketones.236 Thus, CH3CHO photochemistry will be treated together with ketones (see section 8). In this section, we will mainly focus on the photochemistry of CH2O.
7.1 Formaldehyde on r-TiO2(110)
Yates and coworkers225 studied the thermal chemistry of CH2O on the r-TiO2(110) surface. Using the TPD method, these authors observed reductive coupling of CH2O adsorbed at Ov sites to yield C2H4, with Ov playing a key role in the reaction. They also speculated that the product C2H4 was due to the recombination of two dioxy-methylene (–OCH2O–) groups at higher surface temperatures (∼500 K), which was formed through the reaction of the initially adsorbed CH2O at Ov sites with an adjacent Ob, leading to the formation of an –OCH2O– species. Later, Qiu and coworkers230 investigated the thermal chemistry of CH2O on the r-TiO2(110) surface with TPD and HREELS methods. In their work, paraformaldehyde yielded from polymerization of Ti5c-bound CH2O molecules was proposed as the dominant product based on the HREELS results when exposing the perfect r-TiO2(110) surface to CH2O at 100 K, and reductive coupling of CH2O to produce C2H4via a diolate (–OCH2CH2O–) surface intermediate by CH2O adsorbed at the Ovs of the defective surface was demonstrated. More recently, in analogy with the adsorption of other oxygenates on r-TiO2(110) and polymerization of CH2O on (WO3)3/r-TiO2(110), Kim and coworkers concluded that CH2O molecules adsorbed at Ti5c sites in the monomer form.231
A series of theoretical studies193,228,229,242 illustrated that η2 dioxymethylene CH2O, which bound to a Ti5c site and nearby Ob, was the preferred adsorption structure, compared to an η1 CH2O adsorption at Ti5c sites on stoichiometric r-TiO2(110). On the reduced surface, Ov was the most stable adsorption site, and the η2 dioxymethylene configuration was also formed with carbon binding to two Obs. However, a recent STM study242 of CH2O on reduced r-TiO2(110) observed clearly that the Ov-bound CH2O started to diffuse along the Ob row at ∼170 K. While the Ti5c-bound ones started to diffuse along the Ti5c row as an intact molecule at ∼215 K, the binding structure, i.e., η2 or η1, could not be identified.
The most well-studied aldehydes on r-TiO2(110) in terms of photochemistry is CH2O.233–235 Using the highly sensitive TPD method, Xu and co-workers233 have investigated the photo-induced (400 nm) decomposition of CH2O on reduced r-TiO2(110). Without irradiation, the 280 K peak in TPD spectra at m/z = 28 and m/z = 29 (Fig. 23A and B) was the result of dissociative ionization of the desorbed parent CH2O molecule in the electron-bombardment ionizer. Upon irradiation, the intensity of the 280 K CH2O peak in TPD spectra at m/z = 29 decreased monotonically as the laser irradiation time. Meanwhile, two additional new desorption peaks at 486 K and 580 K grew in the m/z = 29 TPD spectrum. Compared to previous investigations of HCOOH adsorbed on r-TiO2(110),243–246 these authors assigned the 486 K TPD peak to the recombination of surface formates with surface hydroxyl groups at Ob rows, and the 580 K TPD peak to the desorption of formate. The increased CO TPD signal for m/z = 28 at 580 K was a result of the decomposition of the formate species. The large TPD signal for desorbed CO indicated that formate is an important photo-induced product.

In order to produce formate, the carbon atom of the CH2O molecule must acquire a second O atom to form the O–CH2O structure first. Thus, they suggested that,233 in the absence of O2, the second O atom may come either from an Ob row or from another CH2O molecule adsorbed on a Ti5c site of the surface. As shown in Fig. 23D, the increase of the C2H4 signal yielded by the carbon–carbon coupling reaction of two CH2O molecules adsorbed at Ov sites with irradiation time strongly demonstrated that methylene groups were transferred to Obs during UV irradiation to leave the O atom of the CH2O molecule at Ti5c sites, which was most likely to occur via a dioxymethylene intermediate with the carbon atom of the CH2O molecule binding to an Ob nearby. This conclusion was further supported by the appearance and increase of CH3 products on Obs after UV irradiation (Fig. 23E). While, the increasing intensity of the recombinative desorption peak of HCOOH suggested that H atoms of CH2O molecules were transferred to Ob sites during UV irradiation.
With careful experimental investigations, these authors233 proposed a schematic model for the photo-induced decomposition of CH2O on r-TiO2(110), as depicted in Fig. 24. In the absence of O2, the Ti5c-bound CH2O adsorbed in the η2 structure or the η1 structure. Then the methylene of CH2O might transfer to an Ob nearby via the η2 structure through a photo-induced process, with the O atom of CH2O left on a Ti5c site. This O atom might react with a nearby CH2O to form a CH2O–O complex. Finally, formate is produced with an H atom of the CH2O–O complex transferring to an Ob site by UV irradiation, and this is the main reaction channel for formate production. Meanwhile, the η2 structure Ti5c-bound CH2O may also react to form formate, which is a minor channel.

Cremer and co-workers234 further investigated the photo-oxidation of CH2O on both reduced and oxygen-riched r-TiO2(110) surfaces. On the reduced surface, the source of the additional O atoms for CH2O oxidation to form formate was generated from a less efficient and more complex photodecomposition pathway of CH2O. Therefore the efficiency for photo-oxidation of CH2O on reduced r-TiO2(110) was very low, which was similar to the results obtained by Xu and coworkers.233 With increasing bulk reduction of the crystal, the photochemical activity on the reduced surface was severely diminished. Thus, they suggested that Ovs could quench photo-oxidation. They also found that the efficiency of formate production on a highly reduced surface was about four times smaller than on one with similar bulk reduction but containing surface O adatoms, indicating that the efficiency of photo-oxidation of CH2O to produce formate on r-TiO2(110) was strongly dependent on the degree of reduction in the surface and near-surface region.
7.2 Ketones on r-TiO2(110)

7.2.1 Acetone on r-TiO2(110). 
The adsorption of acetone, the simplest ketone, on r-TiO2(110) has been studied using TPD and EELS in combination by Henderson.167,247–249 On the reduced surface with 7% ML Ov, submonolayer acetone bound molecularly in an η1 configuration via the donation of the lone pair electrons of the carbonyl oxygen to the empty 3d states of Ti5c. The desorption temperature shifted from 345 K at low coverage to 175 K at around 1 ML due to the strong intramolecular repulsion. Moreover, Henderson found no evidence for preferential binding at the Ovs, which are usually the favorite adsorption sites for many adsorbates.12 Exposure of r-TiO2(110) surfaces to molecular O2 prior to acetone significantly affected the adsorption behavior of acetone. A small fraction of the adsorbed acetone underwent irreversible dissociation. Concomitantly, 0.25 ML acetone was stabilized until 375 K. This desorption state was assigned to an η2 configuration acetone–oxygen complex according to the oxygen isotope-labeled TPD experiments and the 1425 cm−1 feature in the HREELS. The additional oxygens in the acetone–oxygen complex were most likely the reactive O adatoms at the Ti5c sites which stem from the dissociation of molecular O2 at Ovs73,117 and/or Ti5c sites.81,83 The formation of the η2 acetone–oxygen complex was consistent with STM250,251 and DFT studies.252
The photochemistry of acetone on the r-TiO2(110) surface has been investigated systematically by Henderson and White et al.253–259 The η1 bounded acetone was inert on r-TiO2(110) when exposed to UV light, while the η2 acetone–oxygen complex, i.e., the acetone diolate, was photoactive.253 Post-irradiation TPD results suggested that acetone diolate was photocatalytically converted into acetate (Fig. 25A). PSD measurements in Fig. 25B clearly revealed the ejection of methyl radicals. The methyl signal showed a spike when the acetone covered r-TiO2(110) was initially exposed to the UV light in the O2 background. Despite the quick shrink in the first five seconds, the methyl signal did not vanish during the whole UV irradiation period (300 s). The author attributed the difference in the reaction rate of acetone photooxidation to the availability of reactive oxygen species required for the production of acetone diolate. The generation of reactive oxygen species is associated with Ti3+. Henderson proposed that Ti3+ related to the fast process originated from the creation of Ovs, whereas those for the slow one were generated through trapping photoexcited electrons at surfaces. Henderson thus suggested a two-step reaction for the photooxidation of acetone on TiO2 which could be described as follows:253 η1-acetone(a) + oxygen(a)* → η2-acetone diolate(a)(21) η2-acetone diolate(a) + UV → CH3(g) + acetate(a)(22)
 Fig. 25  (A) Post-irradiation TPD spectra (m/z = 42) of 1 ML acetone on r-TiO2(110) as a function of UV exposure in an oxygen background of 5 × 10−7 Torr. (B) PSD spectra of various masses during the exposure of 0.75 ML acetone adsorbed r-TiO2(110) which was held at 200 K to UV illumination in an oxygen background of 5 × 10−8 Torr. Isotope labeled experiments clearly suggests the ejection of the methyl radical. Modified with permission from ref. 253. Copyright 2005 American Chemical Society. 
This two-step reaction involved a first thermal reaction of η1-acetone with reactive oxygen species to generate η2-acetone diolate, which had a reaction barrier of about 10 kJ mol−1, and a second photocatalytic decomposition of η2-acetone diolate into the gas phase methyl radical and adsorbed acetate.
Followed by Henderson's finding of a fast and slow production of methyl radicals during the photooxidation of acetone on r-TiO2(110), Wilson and coworkers measured the velocity distribution of ejected methyl radicals directly using the pulsed laser based TOF technique.258 As expected, they observed two components of the translation energy distribution with the average energies of 0.19 eV and 0.03 eV, respectively (Fig. 26). By analogy with the dynamics of gas phase dissociative ionization of acetone, the authors suggested the hole mediated decomposition of the acetone diolate at the excited rather than ground state. Further state-resolved measurements of the CD3 radical using (2 + 1) resonance enhanced multiphoton ionization (REMPI) by Kershis et al. revealed the production of both ground (v = 0) and excited (v = 1) vibrational states in the umbrella mode (Fig. 26).259 The ratio between the yield at v = 0 to that at v = 1 suggested a rather cold vibrational temperature of 151 ± 15 K, indicating the existence of a late transition state during the photocatalytic decomposition of the acetone diolate. The mean translational energies in the fast methyl channel differ by 30 meV between v = 0 and v = 1 products, which is of the same order of magnitude but not equal to the vibrational level spacing of the umbrella mode (57 meV).260 Such a discrepancy indicated that the substrate and/or other internal states might involve in the energy transfer process.

7.3 Other ketones on the r-TiO2(110) surface
Aside from acetone, the photochemistry of a series of other ketones, for example, butanone,261–264 pinacolone,257,265 halogen-substituted acetone,256,257,266,267 acetyl chloride257 and acetophenone,31,257 has also been investigated. Similar to acetone, the photodecomposition of these ketones could also be described as a two-step process illustrated in Fig. 27.257 The first step, a thermal conversion of the weakly bounded η1-ketone (R1(CO)R2) into strongly adsorbed η2-ketone diolate via the interaction with reactive oxygen species at the r-TiO2(110) surface, was followed by the facile photodecomposition of the η2-ketone diolate, ejecting a ligand radical into the vacuum and leaving a caboxylate species on the surface. In the case of R1 not equal to R2, which ligand would be preferentially ejected? Experimental investigation by Henderson253,257,266,267 together with theoretical analysis by Deskin et al.257,266 and Wang et al.256 have provided a general rule for the bond cleavage in the photooxidation of ketones on r-TiO2(110). Table 1 shows the experimentally observed products and the reaction energies for the photodecomposition of ketones in different pathways.257

For acetone, acetaldehyde, butanone, acetophenone, acetyl chloride, 1-chloroacetone and 1,1-dichloroacetone, the experimental observation agreed well with the DFT prediction. In these cases, the weak C–R bond dissociated, suggesting that the reaction was governed by thermodynamics. However, in the case of 1,1,1-trichloroacetone and 1,1,1-trifluoroacetone, besides the detection of CO which did not involve the diolate, both CH3 and CX3 (X = Cl, F) radicals were liberated through the photodecomposition of the diolate,266 which contradicted with the theoretical calculation which showed that only CX3 was produced. Given the discrepancy between experimental results and theoretical calculations, Henderson and coworkers proposed that the dynamics of charge transfer in the heavy halogen substituted ketones might affect the reaction pathway. TOF measurements carried out by Wilson et al. showed that the energy of the fast methyl ejection channel of photooxidation of CH3COR (R = H, CH3, CH2CH3 and C6H5) on r-TiO2(110) increased with the weight of the R ligand.268
8. Carboxylic acids on rutile and anatase TiO2 surfaces
The adsorption and thermal chemistry of carboxylic acids on r-TiO2(110) has been systematically reviewed by Pang et al.15 In general, carboxylic acids adsorbed dissociatively on TiO2 surfaces, producing a surface hydroxyl and a η2-carboxylate bound to two adjacent Ti5c ions. Such a strong binding structure facilitates the anchoring of organic functional groups onto TiO2 surfaces, which could modify the structures and properties of interfaces, for example, in dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs).269 For small R (R = H, CH3, C(CH3)3) groups, a saturated carboxylic acid (RCOOH) coverage of ∼0.5 ML resulted in an ordered (2 × 1) overlayer.38,270,271
Despite the above general rules, exceptions of carboxylic acid adsorption on the TiO2 surface have also been reported. Employing in situ STM at 350 K, Aizawa and coworkers observed other two types of Ov involved adsorption of formate on r-TiO2(110), i.e., monodentate formate resided in the Ov and bidentate formate with the two O atoms filling the Ov and binding to an adjacent Ti5c, respectively.246 On the r-TiO2(011)-(2 × 1) surface, Tao et al. reported the different adsorption dynamics of acetic acid from r-TiO2(110) by means of TPD, UPS and STM.272 At RT, acetic acid could not adsorb onto the surface until an Ov was encountered due to the severe steric hindrance on this surface. The pre-adsorbed acetic acid at Ov then facilitated the growth of a quasi one-dimensional structure. Based on the coverage of the adsorbed acetate molecule and the charge transfer between the adsorbate and substrate, the authors proposed a monodentate adsorption structure of acetate on the r-TiO2(011). In a joint STM and HREELS study, Lyubinetsky and coworkers proposed a dynamical bonding of the dissociated acidic hydrogen to a pair of Obs due to the electrostatic interaction with the trimethyl acetate (TMA) groups, leading to the invisibility of OH features.273 Bidentate TMA binding to an Ov and a Ti5c has also been reported by Lyubinetsky et al.274
In spite of the fact that formate was photo-inactive on r-TiO2(110) even under UV irradiation, Ariga et al. provided the first evidence for visible light photocatalysis on pure TiO2, using the formate/r-TiO2(001) model system.275Fig. 28 summarizes their results: in the presence of O2, surface hydroxyls were produced when the formate/TiO2 surface was exposed to UV (a) or visible (b) light. Most interestingly, a photon energy threshold of 2.1–2.3 eV, which was significantly below the band gap of bulk rutile, was found for this photocatalytic reaction. Further EELS measurements confirmed the band gap narrowing which was attributed to the existence of low coordination atoms according to DFT calculations. Photoreaction of acetic acid on r-TiO2(110) and (011) surfaces have also been investigated in Idriss's group.276,277 Gas phase O2 was indispensable in these reactions.

Although there were only a few studies concerning the photochemistry of formate and acetate on single crystal TiO2 surfaces, the photodecomposition of TMA on r-TiO2(110) has been extensively studied by Henderson and coworkers.38,278–286 Upon UV irradiation of the TMA/r-TiO2(110) interface at low temperature (<300 K), TMA species underwent a rapid hole mediated reaction to eject CO2, leaving tert-butyl radicals on the surface. While heating to RT, tert-butyl radicals underwent thermal reaction to produce mainly isobutene along with some isobutane.287 EELS measurements suggested that the photogenerated electrons were trapped at the surface.278 It was clear that carbon containing products of photodecomposition of TMA on r-TiO2(110) were readily removed, and thus this reaction provided a strategy to prepare hydroxylated TiO2 with OH coverage up to 0.5 ML.38 The difficulty of this method was the relatively low vapor pressure of TMAA (∼0.5 Torr at RT) which lead to a long dosing time. A combined STM, EELS and DFT study by Wang et al. revealed that the photodecomposition of TMA on r-TiO2(110) occurred exclusively at Ti5c sites, providing a site-specific understanding of this model reaction.286 The authors proposed that the localized excess electrons around Ovs quenched the photogenerated holes effectively, screening the TMA species at the Ov sites (Fig. 29).

Photodecomposition of TMA on a-TiO2(001) surfaces was also investigated. Owing to the lack of high quality anatase single crystals, Ohsawa et al. prepared a-TiO2(001) films using the molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) technique and studied the photolysis of TMA on this film.283 They found that both the reaction mechanism and the reaction rate on a-TiO2(001) were similar to those on r-TiO2(110). Photodecomposition of TMA has been chosen to explore the effect of TiO2 crystallography and orientation on the photoreactivity by Ohsawa and coworkers.284,285 The N doped TiO2 (Ti2−xNx, x ≤ 0.2) films were prepared by MBE growth. By measuring the reaction kinetics, the authors proposed that the N sites were effective hole trapping sites in r-TiO2(110), while this function of doped N in a-TiO2(001) became negligible.284 In ref. 285, Ohsawa et al. suggested that the hole trapping ability of doped N in r-TiO2(100) was more transient compared to those in r-TiO2(110) and r-TiO2(001).
9. Challenges
As an ideal model of the semiconductor photocatalyst, TiO2 has been widely investigated because of its relatively efficient photoactivity, high chemical stability, low cost, as well as its low toxicity for both humans and the environment. Unfortunately, the ζ parameter (defined as the rate of formation of reaction products divided by the incident photon flow)61 of TiO2 catalysts is usually rather small. In fact, time-resolved spectroscopic studies demonstrate that most of the photogenerated electron–hole pairs (∼90%) recombine rapidly after excitation. This is proposed to be one main reason for the relatively low ζ (<10%) for TiO2-based photocatalytic reactions.61
A variety of approaches have been proposed to promote the efficiency of charge separation in TiO2, including heterojunctions, cocatalysts (such as metal, metal oxide, and hydroxide, sulfide) and bulk dopants (i.e., metal, carbon, and nitrogen). The metal doping in TiO2 can redshift the threshold of the TiO2 absorption into the visible light region (decrease the band gap energy of TiO2) and enhance the efficiency of charge separation.288 For example, Grätzel et al.289 found that the quantum yield of H2 generation in the overall water splitting reaction can be achieved to ∼30% at 310 nm by using a bifunctional colloidal TiO2 loaded with Pt and RuO2. In this system, Pt is the H2 evolution site, while RuO2 is the O2 evolution site. In a recent review, Li and coworkers8 have presented the perspectives of TiO2-based photocatalysts for the production of hydrogen by biomass conversion and water splitting as well as generation of carbon-based chemical fuels by photo-reduction of CO2, and the plausible mechanisms of H2O splitting and CO2 reduction have also been summarized.
In addition to the metal doping methods, the synergistic effect of the localized surface plasmon resonance (SPR) absorption by metal nanoparticles loading has been considered to be another promising approach for the enhancement of photocatalytic activity of TiO2 photocatalysts. Whereas, despite lots of exciting results,290–297 the exact mechanisms responsible for SPR-enhanced photocatalysis remain unclear. For instance, Han and coworkers291 has reported that the rate of hydrogen generation under visible light irradiation using the Janus Au–TiO2 photocatalysts with 70 nm Au nanoparticles is higher than that with 30 nm Au nanoparticles. Based on a series of results, these authors proposed that the efficient visible-light hydrogen generation with Janus Au–TiO2 photocatalysts is due to the enhanced optical absorption of TiO2 itself caused by the strong SPR-enhanced electromagnetic (EM) fields close to the Au–TiO2 interface, leading to enhanced electron–hole pair generation. Meanwhile, Silva and coworkers290 have shown that Au–TiO2 with 1.87 nm Au nanoparticles has the best activity for hydrogen generation, and these authors claimed that the injection of photo-induced hot electrons from Au nanoparticles to the conduction band of TiO2 plays a key role in the enhanced photocatalytic activity. Obviously, such a controversial understanding of the role of plasmonic metals impedes the development of new photocatalytic materials for efficient visible-light-driven H2O reduction to produce H2.
For these real catalytic systems, many elementary reactions are involved, and it is a big challenge to identify all elementary reaction steps and related active sites. Furthermore, electron and energy transfers occur in reactions simultaneously, whereas, the concept that the reactions are promoted by separated hole and electron transfer is usually over-emphasized, while the dynamics of electron transfer and the energy transfer process in photocatalysis is rarely investigated in literature. Thus, in addition to investigation of the elementary reaction steps of these real catalytic systems experimentally, development of the theoretical understanding of photocatalytic processes at the most fundamental level from the dynamics point of view is also quite important. In the previous published studies,176,210,298–300 one surprising fact is that certain well controlled experimental results obtained are not fully consistent with the well accepted photocatalysis model based on the concept that electrons and holes are the driving force.4 For example, methanol can be photocatalyzed on r-TiO2(110) at 400 nm while water cannot at exactly the same wavelength,176 as well as the strong photon energy dependence of methanol and water photocatalysis on r-TiO2(110)210 It is therefore fair to question whether this traditional photocatalysis model is only the good model to explain all heterogeneous photocatalytic processes. From the dynamics point of view, the traditional photocatalysis model is essentially a model that is based on excited state reactions where electrons and holes are separated (Fig. 30). We have proposed a new model (Fig. 30) based on nonadiabatic dynamics and ground state surface reactions, which can qualitatively explain some recent experimental results for the photocatalysis of water and methanol on r-TiO2(110). This new model described the importance of the surface dynamics in photocatalysis. However, our model is proposed based on the studies of photocatalysis of methanol and water on TiO2 under vacuum conditions. However, whether this model is applicable in other photocatalysis systems needs to be further tested with well controlled photocatalysis experiments in the future. In addition, theoretical studies of surface nonadiabatic processes and surface reaction dynamics are also urgently needed in order to gain clear and fundamental insights into the photocatalysis processes.
 Fig. 30  A possible photocatalysis model based on nonadiabatic dynamical processes and ground state reactions. In this model, photoexcited electron–hole pairs are nonadiabatically recombined to convert the excited electronic state energy to the ground state energy, which drives the chemical reactions on the ground state surface. 
10. Concluding remarks
In this review, we have summarized recent progress made in the study of elementary processes in photocatalysis of several organic and inorganic molecules on TiO2 surfaces. The photochemical products, reaction pathways and chemical kinetics obtained through site-specific STM imaging and/or ensemble-averaging desorption/photonic/electronic spectroscopy contributed significantly to our knowledge of TiO2 heterogeneous photocatalysis. The reaction sites, pathways and kinetics clearly provided clues for analyzing the charge transfer process. Despite the achievements made in photocatalytic chemistry on TiO2 surfaces, more investigations are still required in order to understand the dynamics of photocatalytic reactions on surfaces at the most fundamental level.
Measuring the reaction and interfacial charge transfer dynamics is always challenging. Thus far, the photochemistry on TiO2 surfaces was monitored on minute, second and even millisecond timescales. These macroscopic kinetics measurements definitely helped us to understand the macroscopic pictures of photochemical reaction processes. However, it would be hard to derive the microscopic dynamical picture of photocatalytic processes just from these macroscopic measurements. Studies of ultrafast dynamics on these surfaces would certainly help us to understand better the microscopic photocatalytic dynamics on these surfaces.
Direct detection of the transition state is considered as a Holy Grail in chemistry research, even though detecting transition states on surface reactions is extremely challenging. Development of new techniques, such as free electron lasers (FEL), provides great opportunities in this area. Recently breakthroughs have been made in the detection of chemical bond cleavage and construction on metal surfaces. By using femtosecond time-resolved X-ray absorption and emission spectroscopy (XAS and XES), Nilsson et al. observed the first bond cleavage and construction on surfaces in the studies of CO desorption from Ru(0001)301 and CO interaction with O on the same surface,302 respectively. However, the direct detection of transition states in photocatalytic chemistry hasn't been reported thus far, investigation of the femtosecond time evolution of the valence structure of adsorbates in photocatalytic systems by using time-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy (e.g., ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy realized by FEL or high order harmonic generation in the extremely ultraviolet/soft X-ray regime) might bring breakthroughs in this direction. The femtosecond time-resolved UV pump and IR/sum frequency generation (SFG) probe is also a promising method to study the ultrafast dynamics which could provide important insights into the reaction mechanism.
Although ultrafast electron transfer from the excited dye molecules and quantum dots to the TiO2 acceptor has been directly monitored,303,304 studies on photoexcited charge transfer from TiO2 single crystals to adsorbates are still rare. Future work making use of 2PPE could help us in understanding the mechanism of charge transfer from the substrate to adsorbates. The electronic structure of the TiO2 substrate, the adsorbate and the matching between them are crucial to the charge transfer. Hot photoexcited charge carriers were regarded to thermalize at an ultrafast timescale to the respective band edges, making the construction of specific TiO2-adsorbate structures which facilitate even faster interfacial charge transfer a promising subject. The use of ultrafast techniques would certainly help us to understand better these hot electron processes. Another strategy for making good use of the photon energy is the multi-exciton generation (MEG) which has been realized in quantum dots and nanocrystals.305–307
The existence of surface faces and the surface state make the surface different from the bulk, introducing distinct chemical and photochemical properties. For example, Tao et al.308 prepared a new two-dimensional phase which introduced a surface state of Ti4sp character in the band gap by annealing the r-TiO2(011)-(2 × 1) surface in the O2 background. Such a surface state successfully closed the band gap to 2.1 eV, a step towards visible light photocatalysis. Another example for surface mediated visible light photocatalysis on pure TiO2 was provided by Ariga and co-workers.275 The nanostructured r-TiO2(001) surface layer had a surface band gap which was significantly smaller than the bulk, and this smaller surface band gap facilitates the photooxidation of formate under visible light irradiation. Latest studies in our laboratory showed that the previously reported excited state which was located at 2.4 eV above EF at the r-TiO2(110) interface was actually an intrinsic state of Ti3+ rather than the adsorbate induced. Similarly to the well-studied gap state at ∼1.0 eV below EF, this excited state was found to come from the Jahn–Teller induced splitting of the 3d–t2g orbitals of Ti3+ ions in reduced TiO2. This state could be accessed via 3d → 3d transitions from the gap state and contributed significantly to the photoabsorption of TiO2 (Fig. 31).309 Though the lifetime of this excited was less than 20 fs, the possibility of interfacial charge transfer via this state still could not be ruled out. This localized excitation will extend the photoabsorption to the visible range, consistent with the observed enhancement of the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 under visible light irradiation through Ti3+ self-doping.194,310–313

Surface orientation also has a significant effect on the photoactivity of TiO2.314 Synthesizing TiO2 with specific facets and constructing TiO2 heterojunctions that exhibit distinct properties at different facets have become promising fields.203,315–317 Besides the surface atomic configuration, electronic structure and energetics, the anisotropic charge carrier transportation, trapping, detrapping and transfer should also be taken into account to understand the orientation dependence of the photoactivity of TiO2.318,319 In addition, the exact role (e.g., reaction sites and charge separation) of the co-catalyst such as Pt in the photoactivity of TiO2 should also be investigated closely. Furthermore, photocatalysis studied under high pressure and in solution using photon-in and photon-out techniques such as surface sensitive second harmonic generation (SHG), SFG and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) is also desirable.
