    , Accepted 12th April 2017First published on 12th April 2017AbstractPbI2 heterogeneous-cap-induced crystallization with a face-to-face configuration is proposed to obtain efficient CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite films during thermal annealing. The films with large-size and dominative (110)-oriented grains can effectively boost the photovoltaic performance of the perovskite solar cells.
CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite materials were introduced for the first time as sensitizers in photovoltaic cells in 20091 and afterwards they have been applied in photodetectors,2 light-emitting diodes,3 lasers,4 and especially perovskite solar cells (PSCs)5,6 due to their favourable direct bandgap,7 low exciton binding energy, long exciton lifetime and diffusion length,8 and, most importantly, high mobility for charge carriers of both polarities.9 The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs has been boosted from 3.8% to more than 21%,10 and PSCs have been seen as a new prospective generation of photovoltaic devices, considering their low cost,9 simple fabrication,5 good tolerance of defects and easy self-assembly ability.11
Generally, in PSCs, it is essential to obtain high-quality uniform CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite films with large-size grains and few grain boundaries. Lots of works have been done towards this end, such as solvent engineering,12 laser-assisted annealing,13 subsequent deposition,14 room-temperature formation,15–17 and so on. Of all, one-step spin-coating is the most widely applied method wherein PbI2 and CH3NH3I are dissolved in DMF (N,N-dimethylformamide) plus a little DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide) as a precursor solution to obtain CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite films.1 However, we cannot easily obtain prospective high-quality uniform CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite films through a simple approach due to the undesirable crystallization that leads to small-size grains and many grain boundaries. Herein, we propose a simple approach to enhance the crystallinity of the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite film and hence the PCE of PSCs by successfully introducing PbI2 heterogeneous-cap-induced crystallization where the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite film is covered face-to-face with a PbI2 heterogeneous cap during thermal annealing.
The cap-induced crystallization method in which a homogeneous cap is usually placed face-to-face on the precursor film during thermal annealing is proposed for the first time for GaAs materials to minimize their surface degradation18 and afterwards extended to various functional materials such as polycrystalline silicon,19 ZnO,20 Mg0.25Zn0.75O,21 SrBi2Ta2O9,22 and recently CH3NH3PbI3.23 It has been proved that a homogeneous cap is beneficial in enhancing crystallinity, decreasing surface defects, and optimizing grain orientation. In our work, we verify that a PbI2 heterogeneous cap is also available by successfully introducing a heterogeneous cap face-to-face annealing process wherein the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite film is covered face-to-face with a PbI2 heterogeneous cap during thermal annealing. And the obtained CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite film turns out to be of high quality with large-size grains and the preferred (110) grain orientation. What's more, PSCs with the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite film annealed with the PbI2 heterogeneous cap exhibit higher optimized and average PCEs. And similarly to our previous work, we take the solvent molecules into consideration,23 but what's different is that we reasonably believe that this shift may also be caused by a similar Oswald ripening process rather than the simply liquid phase sintering at the interface between the PbI2 heterogeneous cap and the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite film during thermal annealing. Without a doubt, this approach, we proposed here, is definitely a new solution to enhance the crystallization of the perovskite film and further the PCE of the PSCs, which we hope will inspire more efforts towards better crystallization and efficiency in PSCs in the near future.
The precursor CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite film was prepared via the solvent engineering-assisted one-step spin-coating method reported by Park et al.24 and is also illustrated in Fig. S1 (ESI†). The heterogeneous PbI2 cap was prepared by the optimized approach reported by Park et al.25 and is also illustrated in Fig. S2 (ESI†). There are further details in the ESI.† After annealing, the heterogeneous PbI2 cap was cooled down to room temperature. Then, as shown in Fig. 1a, we introduced the heterogeneous cap face-to-face annealing process wherein the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite film was covered face-to-face with the prepared PbI2 heterogeneous cap during thermal annealing at 110 °C for ∼15 minutes and then the PbI2 cap was removed. We also prepared a control sample annealed without the cap as shown in Fig. 1a and with the TiO2 heterogeneous cap which only satisfied the same thermodynamic conditions but lacked the PbI2 film as illustrated in Fig. S3 (ESI†). To confirm and compare the crystallinity, we performed X-ray diffraction (XRD) as shown in Fig. 1b and Fig. S4 (ESI†). As we can see, the diffusion peaks all correspond to the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite film or the substrate as reported26 without any impurity diffusion peak. And what's more important is that the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite film annealed with either PbI2 or the TiO2 heterogeneous cap exhibits a much stronger diffusion peak intensity, which definitely reveals obviously enhanced crystallization due to less scattering of the grain boundaries.27 Besides, we can also compare the grain orientation through the XRD patterns. If we define the value of the intensity of the (110) peak divided by the intensity of the (310) peak as I110/I310 and the value of the intensity of the (220) peak divided by the intensity of the (310) peak as I220/I310, then we get that I110/I210 and I220/I310 of the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite film annealed with the PbI2 heterogeneous cap are 4.22 and 2.93 respectively. However, for the control sample, they are only 1.79 and 1.13, which means that the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite film annealed with the PbI2 heterogeneous cap exhibits a better preferred (110) grain orientation.23,28,29 Thus, the enhanced crystallization and the preferred (110) grain orientation contribute to more efficient transport of charge carriers and, of course, enhancement of the performance of the fabricated PSCs. Finally, we also performed XRD to confirm the crystallization of the PbI2 and TiO2 heterogeneous cap as shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†) and the results are as expected. Furthermore, we performed X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to confirm the elemental composition. The results, as shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†), were calibrated with C 1s (284.5 eV) as ref. 30, from which we can draw the conclusion that the obtained CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite film is pure without other elements except for C, N, Pb, and I because there is no other sharp peak except for the O 1s peak which corresponds to O2 in the air.

(b) XRD patterns of the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite films annealed with and without the PbI2 cap. The diamond symbols correspond to the signals from the TiO2/FTO substrate. 
To investigate the microstructure, we performed scanning electron microscopy (SEM). As shown in Fig. 2a, c and Fig. S7 (ESI†), the grain sizes of the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite film annealed with either the PbI2 or TiO2 heterogeneous cap are much bigger than those of the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite film annealed without the cap, which is in accordance with the conclusion drawn from the XRD patterns, revealing better crystallinity. The cross-sectional SEM images are shown in Fig. S8 (ESI†). They further revealed larger-size grains and fewer grain boundaries. Such improvement is beneficial for charge carrier transport. Moreover, it can be seen in Fig. S7 (ESI†) that there are too many pin-holes in the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite film annealed with the heterogeneous TiO2 cap, which is definitely unacceptable in PSCs. Finally, we also obtain the top-view SEM image of the heterogeneous PbI2 cap we used for confirmation as shown in Fig. S9 (ESI†). And then we performed atomic force microscopy (AFM) to investigate its surface roughness. As can be seen in Fig. 2b and d, the surface roughness of the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite film annealed with the PbI2 heterogeneous cap is larger but definitely acceptable, which is a result of large-size grains31 and in accordance with our conclusion of better crystallinity. Generally speaking, larger-size grains can guarantee longer exciton diffusion length and less non-radiative recombination than the smaller-size ones due to decreased defects, and hence deliver better performance in PSCs.

To investigate the optical properties, we first conducted steady-state photoluminescence (PL) measurements. As shown in Fig. 3a, the sharp emission peak of both films is at ∼770 nm and in accordance with the bandgap luminescence as reported.1 We can obtain the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the curve via Gaussian fitting. The FWHM of the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite film annealed with the PbI2 heterogeneous cap is 9.97 nm, while for the control sample, it is 10.20 nm. The smaller FWHM indicates fewer defects and matches with our drawn conclusion. Herein, both films were deposited on an insulated silicon wafer. And to further investigate the transport of the charge-carriers, we conducted room-temperature time-resolved PL spectroscopy. In particular, both films were spin-coated on a compact TiO2 layer on FTO glass, on which a spiro-OMeTAD precursor solution was spin-coated as a hole-transport material (HTM). There are specific details in the ESI.† As can be seen from Fig. 3b, the fluorescence quenched faster in the sample with the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite film annealed with the PbI2 heterogeneous cap, demonstrating that the transport of the charge-carriers is more efficient at the TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3 and CH3NH3PbI3/HTM interfaces,29 which mainly originates from larger grains and fewer grain boundaries as we know from Fig. 1b and 2. Moreover, we also conducted ultra–visible spectroscopy to confirm the light absorption of both films and the results are shown in Fig. S10 (ESI†). Both films exhibit intense absorption in the entire visible region with an onset of ∼800 nm corresponding to a bandgap of ∼1.5 eV as previously reported,7 which further confirms the satisfactory optical properties of CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite materials. As we know, both an efficient charge transport and intense light absorption are certainly beneficial for boosting the PCE.

(b) Normalized time-resolved PL spectra of the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite films annealed with and without the PbI2 cap sandwiched between a compact TiO2 layer and HTM. 
The configuration of the fabricated perovskite solar cells is glass/FTO/TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3/HTM/Ag as illustrated in Fig. S11 and described in the ESI.†Fig. 4a shows the optimized J–V curves of the fabricated perovskite solar cells with the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite films annealed with and without the PbI2 heterogeneous cap and the relevant parameters are listed in Table S1 (ESI†). The solar cells with the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite film annealed with the heterogeneous PbI2 cap exhibit higher performance as expected. Moreover, as shown in Fig. S12 (ESI†), they yielded a stabilized current density of 21.22 mA cm−2 (measured at 0.75 V) with a stabilized PCE of 15.91%. For the control sample, the stabilized current density is 16.93 mA cm−2 (measured at 0.75 V) with a stabilized PCE of 12.65%. Based on the above discussions, we can suggest that the shift is mainly because of the more efficient charge carrier transport due to better crystallization of the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite film. And as we predicted, the PCE of the PSCs with the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite film annealed with the TiO2 heterogeneous cap remarkably decreased due to those unacceptable pin-holes that we can see in Fig. S7, and the J–V curve is shown in Fig. S13 and the relevant parameters are listed in Table S1 (ESI†). What' more, as shown in Fig. 4b, the average PCE of the fabricated perovskite solar cells with the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite film annealed with the PbI2 heterogeneous cap is 15.77%, while for the control sample, it is 12.99%, which means that the proposed method is not only manageable but also reproducible. Moreover, we compared the hysteresis and the results are shown in Fig. S14 (ESI†). As seen, the hysteresis is not significantly reduced via PbI2 heterogeneous-cap-induced crystallization. We believe that the hysteresis originates from the polarization of ionic charges in the CH3NH3PbI3 layer.32 Finally, to further confirm the photoelectric conversion characteristics, we measured the external quantum efficiency (EQE) without any applied white-light bias of the optimized solar cell with the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite film annealed with the PbI2 heterogeneous cap, and the result is shown in Fig. S15 (ESI†). The EQE exceeds 80% across the whole visible region and a short-circuit current density of 21.88 mA cm−2 is calculated from IPCE, which is 6.9% lower than the J–V measurement. This mismatch is usually observed in PSCs and is mainly related to the measurement conditions.33

To explain the enhancement, we come up with two thoughtful theories. We take our previous work into consideration23,33 but definitely not limited to it. The DMF and DMSO solvent molecules undoubtedly play a key role in this process and it's commonly agreed that there are still many residual DMF and DMSO solvent molecules in the spin-coated precursor CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite film before thermal annealing.23 So, as schematically illustrated in Fig. S16 (ESI†), during the PbI2 heterogeneous cap face-to-face annealing process, the residual DMF or DMSO solvent molecules in the precursor CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite film are absorbed by the PbI2 heterogeneous cap rather than just volatilizing easily as in the conventional annealing process, in which case those DMF or DMSO solvent molecules can easily condense on the surface of the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite film, leading to the decrease of the nucleation sites and consequently delivering large-size grains. It can also be seen in our previous work.23 And in the case of the PbI2 heterogeneous cap, what's slightly different from a homogenous cap is that a similar Oswald ripening process may also occur simultaneously where the PbI2 molecules are dissolved by DMF or DMSO and diffuse downwards and directly into the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite film, which increases the surface energy or interfacial energy of the CH3NH3PbI3 grains, especially for the small ones, in which case the small ones will be easily merged with the large ones and the latter just grow bigger based on the theory of Oswald ripening and our previous work.34 Therefore, we attribute the enhancement to both processes mentioned above.
In sum, the PbI2 heterogeneous cap face-to-face annealing process that we introduced here is no doubt a manageable method for enhancing the crystallization of the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite film with large-size grains and the preferred (110) grain orientation. The optimized PCE is consequently boosted due to the more efficient transport of charge carriers and decreased non-radiative recombination. What's more, the promoted average PCE suggests good reproducibility, which is also an important subject in the optimization. And in our work, we attribute this shift to the residual DMF or DMSO solvent molecules in the precursor CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite film as well as a possible similar Oswald ripening process at the interface between the PbI2 heterogeneous cap and the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite film. Consequently, we hope that our work will inspire more efforts towards better crystallization and efficiency in PSCs and further understanding of the Oswald ripening theory in the near future.
