    , Accepted 22nd August 2016First published on 22nd August 2016AbstractUnlike traditional MAPbI3, methods for large scale fabrication of high quality FA based perovskite films are still lacking. In this paper, the organic cation exchange temperature is optimized toward the formation of highly uniform FA based perovskite films. Under optimized conditions, the cation diffusion speed within the perovskite film is extremely enhanced and the time constant is reduced ∼20 times. The shortened dipping time and mild reaction conditions can efficiently restrict the undesirable phase transition and preserve the film morphology. Fundamental insight into this solid–liquid reaction has been obtained by combining photophysical, XRD and SEM characterizations. The optimized FAxMA1−xPbI3 with x ≈ 0.75 presents the highest efficiency of 15.5% with less hysteresis.
1. Introduction
Hybrid organic–inorganic lead halide perovskite solar cells have gained increasing attention due to their easy fabrication and high power conversion efficiency.1 Organolead trihalide perovskite materials have the chemical formula of ABX3, where A is an organic cation, B is a Pb cation, and X is a halogen I, Br or Cl anion.2,3 The mostly studied perovskite material for solar cells is methylammonium lead triiodide (MAPbI3) with a band gap of ∼1.60 eV4,5 and can be easily fabricated via a variety of methods, including one-step spin coating, sequential dip coating, two-step interdiffusion, antisolvent engineering, etc.6–14 The development of versatile processing technologies enables the fast rise of the efficiency to over 20%.15,16
The MAPbI3 perovskite has a tetragonal phase at room temperature (RT) and it always suffers from a structural phase transition to a cubic phase at ∼55 °C, which will degrade its contacting interface under the working conditions.2,17 One effective method is to substitute the methylammonium cation (MA+) with the formamidinium cation (FA+) to form a nearly cubic FAPbI3 perovskite which results from the slightly larger cation size of FA+.18–20 However, the black FAPbI3 perovskite can gradually transform into a yellow non-perovskite δ-FAPbI3 polymorph at RT.3 Bein observed that replacing more than 15% FA+ with MA+ could stabilize its phase due to the enhanced interaction between MA+ and inorganic Pb–I cages.21,22 Unfortunately, most of the reported fabrication technologies are not suitable for FAPbI3 perovskites.23,24 Mixed cation perovskites are then studied.25–29 For instance, Grätzel and his colleagues prepared FAxMA1−xPbI3 perovskites by the sequential method and found FA0.4MA0.6PbI3 to be the optimized composition.25 Han and his colleagues optimized the two-step interdiffusion method by pre-adding 40% FAI in the first PbI2 layer and formed the FA0.4MA0.6PbI3 perovskite.28 Jen et al. elucidated that the FA0.3MA0.7PbI3 is the optimized composition.29 In these cases, the MA-rich perovskite delivers a relatively higher efficiency, which is because highly concentrated MA+ is required to guarantee the formation of the perovskite phase. Recently, dual doping of MA+ and Br− was reported to stabilize the FA-rich perovskite phase. However, the additional Br− introduction sacrificed the absorption range, resulting in a reduced current density.19 Very recently, Snaith reported the solid–liquid cation exchange methods to directly convert the MAPbI3 perovskite to α-FAPbI3 perovskite. However, at RT, the displacement of MA+ with FA+ is always accompanied by the formation of undesired yellow ribbon-like FAPbI3.30
Here, we glean fundamental insight into this solid–liquid reaction and discover that the cation diffusion dramatically depresses the cation displacement reaction. This process can be greatly accelerated by increasing the processing temperature. When the temperature increases from RT to 60 °C, the time constant has been prominently reduced ∼20 times. Additionally, at 60 °C, the black α-FAPbI3 seems more stable than the yellow δ-FAPbI3 polymorph in the isopropanol solution, which suggests that the solution processing temperature is crucial for the fabrication of the pure FAPbI3 or FA-rich perovskite films. As a result, a high efficiency of 15.5% has been realized with FA0.75MA0.25PbI3 as the light harvesting layer.
2. Detailed experimental details
2.1 Film fabrication and characterization
MAI, FAI and TiO2 gel were all synthesized in the lab as we previously reported.20 To form the FAPbI3 precursor solution, MAI and PbI2 were dissolved in anhydrous N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) in a 1:1 molar ratio to form a 40 wt% solution. Then the precursor was spin-coated in a nitrogen-filled glove box at 3000 rpm on a 20 nm thick mesoporous TiO2/FTO substrate followed by a thermal treatment at 100 °C for 10 min. Subsequently, the MAPbI3 film was treated with methylammonium gas to flatten the film. For the RT dipping, the starting MAPbI3 film was directly immersed into a 10 wt% FAI solution in isopropanol for 1–240 min. After the reaction, the films were rinsed with fresh isopropanol, dried with a N2 flow, and heated at 140 °C for 10 min. For high temperature dipping, both the starting MAPbI3 film and the 10 wt% FAI solution were preheated at 60 °C and then the MAPbI3 film was immersed into the FAI solution for 1–10 min, 240 min. After the reaction, the films were rinsed with fresh isopropanol, dried with a N2 flow, and heated at 140 °C for 10 min. For comparison, the reference FAPbI3 perovskite was prepared by the PbCl2–3FAI recipe.23 XRD patterns were recorded on an X-ray diffractometer (D8 Advance, Bruker, Germany) using Cu Kα radiation. UV-Vis absorption spectra of the perovskite films were recorded using a spectrometer (U-4100, Hitachi, Japan). A field emission SEM (S-4800, Hitachi, Japan) was used to observe the top surfaces and cross-sections. The two-dimensional grazing incidence X-ray diffraction patterns were achieved at beamline 1W1A (l = 0.15409 nm) at Beijing Synchrotron Radiation Facility using a Huber diffractometer for alignment and a Mar345 area detector for measurement.
2.2 Device fabrication and characterization
A 30 nm thick dense TiO2 layer and a 300 nm thick TiO2 porous layer were sequentially deposited on the FTO glass by spin-coating, followed by heat treatment at 550 °C for 30 min in air. The compositional perovskite films were subsequently spin coated on the FTO/TiO2 substrates. A solution of spiro-MeOTAD (99%) hole-transporting material (HTM) was prepared by dissolving 72.3 mg of spiro-MeOTAD in 1 mL of chlorobenzene (99.8%), to which 28.8 μL of 4-tert-butyl pyridine (96%) and 17.5 μL of lithium bis(trifluoro-methanesulfonyl)imide (LITSFI) solution (520 mg LITSFI (98%)) in 1 mL acetonitrile (99.8%) were added. HTM (99%) was prepared by spin coating and a 100 nm thick Ag electrode was thermally evaporated to complete the device. J–V characteristics of the as-fabricated PSCs were measured using a 2400 Sourcemeter (Keithley, USA) under simulated one-sun AM 1.5G 100 mW cm−2 intensity (Oriel Sol3A Class AAA, Newport, USA) with a non-reflective mask. External quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements were carried out on an EQE measurement setup (Newport, USA) comprising a Xe lamp, a Cornerstone™ monochromator, a current–voltage preamplifier, and a lock-in amplifier. All PSC tests were conducted under ambient conditions with a relative humidity of ∼35%.
3. Results and discussion
The cation exchange method entails the immersion of the MAPbI3 perovskite film into a FAI isopropanol solution to replace MA+ with FA+ as illustrated in Fig. 1A. Such solid–liquid cation exchange reaction can be divided into two stages. One is the solid–liquid interface exchange of MA+ with the FA+ cation, and the other is the inner MA+ cation diffusion to the surface with the FA+ cation moving towards an opposite direction. Unlike the traditional PbI2–FAI (or MAI) pair in the sequential dipping method, this solid–liquid reaction has a potential advantage of achieving an ultra-uniform perovskite film owing to the negligible volume change during such organic cation exchange.31–33 Considering the fact that the perovskite film is not stable in the polar isopropanol solvent,30,34 long dipping time should be avoided. Both the interface exchange reaction and inner cation diffusion are thermodynamically favorable processes and could be manipulated via environmental temperature. The increase in temperature involves an increase in the molecule moving speed (kinetic energy), which is thus suggested to be the crucial to reduce the dipping time so as to minimize the side-effect of the isopropanol solvent. It was already discovered that the black α-FAPbI3 perovskite could fully convert to the yellow phase at low temperature (<60 °C) when dispersed in mother liquid.3 Therefore, to increase the exchanging temperature may be reasonable to prevent the phase transition from α-FAPbI3 to δ-FAPbI3 as illustrated in Fig. 1B. However, the temperature can't be enhanced without restriction because of the side reaction between the perovskite material and the isopropanol solvent, which could strongly affect the film morphology (Fig. S1†). Therefore, a mild temperature of 60 °C is selected to balance the cation exchange rate, film morphology and phase stability.

To conduct this cation exchange, an original MAPbI3 film was first prepared by the reported MA gas treatment method,12 and then dipped into the 10 wt% FAI isopropanol solution at RT for different periods of time. The UV-Vis absorption edge of the compositional FAxMA1−xPbI3 perovskite films is gradually red-shifted from ∼780 to ∼820 nm as the dipping time increases from 0 (MAPbI3) to 120 min (Fig. S2†). Meanwhile, the corresponding band gap decreases from 1.601 eV to 1.524 eV deduced from the transformed Kubelka–Munk spectra (Fig. 2A). After dipping for 120 min, the absorption onset is stable and is similar to that of the reference FAPbI3 film (Fig. S4†). On further increasing the dipping time to 240 min, the absorbance obviously decreases as shown in Fig. 2A and S2.†

The interface cation exchange rate and inner diffusion rate highly depend on the temperature. At 60 °C, the cation exchange rate is dramatically improved as evidenced in Fig. 2B and S3.† The as-fabricated FA based perovskite film after dipping for 10 min takes a similar absorption onset to that of the sample dipped for 120 min at RT and the reference α-FAPbI3 film (Fig. S4†).
The calculated band gap values of the synthesized FAxMA1−xPbI3 perovskite films at RT and 60 °C were plotted against dipping time as shown in Fig. 2C. At RT, the band gap values are fitted by two-component exponential equations. It is expected that the first exponential component dominates at the beginning reaction stage as it belongs to interface cation exchange, and the second exponential component dominates at longer reaction time as it is mainly determined by the cation diffusion within the dense perovskite film. The second exponential component could be employed to evaluate the time needed for the inner MA cation to diffuse to the film surface. The deduced time constant (τ) is 42.50 min, and such a large time constant is proposed to be the major barrier for the cation exchange. When the reaction temperature is raised to 60 °C, the whole reaction rate is dramatically increased and can be fitted by a mono-exponential equation (Fig. 2C), indicating that the interface cation exchange and inner diffusion rates are comparable. The deduced time constant (τ) is only 2.32 min which is almost one twentieth of the value obtained from the reaction at RT. The decreased time constant is definitely beneficial for the preservation of the film morphology and prevention of the undesired yellow δ-FAPbI3 phase.
The high temperature cation exchange method is further studied by the X-ray diffraction spectra as shown in Fig. S5,† indicating that there is no yellow non-perovskite δ-FAPbI3 phase formed in all these samples. Fig. 3A is the magnified XRD spectra of FAxMA1−xPbI3 perovskite films around 14.00° with a continuous shift to the position of neat FAPbI3 with increasing dipping time. When the dipping time reaches 10 min, the diffraction peak of the 110 diffraction peak of MAPbI3 shifts to ∼13.96°, which is already very close to that of the neat FAPbI3 perovskite sample (Fig. S6†). It is thus suggested that 10 min is almost enough to fully convert MAPbI3 to FAPbI3 in the used bi-layered perovskite film (200 nm mesoporous layer and 250 nm compact layer). Fig. 3B is the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of these peaks shown in Fig. 3A. It is observed that the alloying of FA in the MAPbI3 perovskite could obviously enhance the film crystallinity according to the Scherrer equation.

The MA+ and FA+ have similar diameters (2.53 Å for FA+ and 2.17 Å for MA+) and can easily form the phase-pure perovskite instead of phase separation of MAPbI3 and FAPbI3. It is obvious that there is a linear relationship between the lattice parameter and optical band gap as illustrated in Fig. 3C, indicating that the difference of the anisotropic binding nature between FAPbI3 and MAPbI3 is negligible. As a matter of fact, besides the well-known difference of the volume and/or cation size, the electrostatics and the hydrogen bonding between the organic cation and iodides could also affect the crystal structure and optical properties.18,35 In this paper, as the main target is to unveil the cation exchange behavior at different temperatures, this complicated organic–inorganic interplay was simplified by driving the composition engineering to follow Vegard's law, where the lattice parameter of a homogeneous solid solution is linearly proportional to the relative composition of each species. In this study, x = (1.601 − b*)/0.077, where b* is the optical band gap, is used to estimate the composition of FAxMA1−xPbI3 dipped for different periods of time.
To further validate the advantage of the high temperature reaction, the SEM images of the perovskite films obtained with different experimental parameters are presented in Fig. 4. At RT, the highly uniform and dense MAPbI3 film (Fig. 4A) requires a relatively long time to replace MA+ with FA+. It can be seen that the morphology is almost preserved but accompanied with some ribbon-like structures on the surface of the film, which should be the yellow non-perovskite δ-FAPbI3 polymorph. With extending the dipping time, the density of the ribbon-like structure gradually increases. It is clearly seen that the under layer is still with a flattened morphology compacted with crystal domains of ∼500 nm. Compared with the starting MAPbI3 perovskite film, more pinhole structures formed with bare porous TiO2 area. This is because the used isopropanol could slowly dissolve the perovskite materials and then form a more stable yellow FAPbI3 phase at RT.
 Fig. 4  SEM images of compositional FAxMA1−xPbI3 perovskite films fabricated at RT (A) and 60 °C (B), respectively. Scale bar is 500 nm. 
When the experiment was conducted at 60 °C, no ribbon-like structure is formed in our experimental range of 1–10 min as shown in Fig. 4B. After dipping for 1 min, grain structures with a diameter of ∼500 nm become distinguishable. By prolonging the reaction time from 1 min to 5 min, neither obvious change of the grain size nor pinhole structure could be formed. When the reaction duration reaches 8–10 min, pinhole structure is formed as can be seen in Fig. 4B.
To discover the difference in the formation kinetics of the yellow δ-FAPbI3 polymorph at different temperatures, the MAPbI3 films were both immersed in FAI solution for 240 min at RT and 60 °C and their corresponding SEM and XRD patterns are presented in Fig. S7.† At RT, a longer dipping time could form a large amount of ribbon structures on the perovskite film (Fig. S7A†), the corresponding XRD result in Fig. S7B† indicates that the ribbon structure belongs to the δ-FAPbI3 polymorph. However, at 60 °C, no ribbon-like structure was formed but a cuboid structure instead (Fig. S7C†). The XRD pattern (Fig. S7D†) indicates that these cuboids and the under discontinuous layer are of the α-FAPbI3 perovskite phase, suggesting that the α-phase is more thermodynamically favorable than the δ-phase FAPbI3 in the isopropanol solvent at 60 °C.
The two-dimensional grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (2DGIXRD) patterns of thin films before and after dipping treatment at 60 °C for 10 min (Fig. 5) both have a strong 110 diffraction arc in the out-of-plane direction, which indicates the preferred 110 orientation. It was proposed that the solid–liquid reaction is an in situ organic cation replacing reaction and will not result in the change of the inorganic framework, and this may lead to the preservation of the morphology of the original MAPbI3 film. The minor difference is attributed to the shift of the 110 diffraction arc around 10 nm−1 towards smaller q values that correspond to the expansion of the lattice, which is in agreement with the XRD results given in Fig. 3.

The cross-sectional SEM image of the as-fabricated FA0.75MA0.25PbI3 perovskite solar cells shown in Fig. 6A is with a 200 nm thick mesoporous layer and a 250 nm thick capping perovskite layer. It can be seen that the porous TiO2 layer is fully filled with the FAxMA1−xPbI3 perovskite materials without pinholes inside. Besides, the capping perovskite layer is also very compact. To study the effect of the dipping time on the device performance, a series of FAxMA1−xPbI3 perovskite films prepared at both RT and 60 °C were assembled and measured (Fig. S9†), and the average device efficiencies with both reverse and forward scans are summarized in Fig. 6B. The composition of the FAxMA1−xPbI3 perovskites is calculated by the already established relationship between the band gap b* and x (x = (1.601 − b*)/0.077). We should note that for both the RT and high temperature synthesized perovskite solar cells, increasing the FA component can obviously reduce the hysteresis. For the RT fabricated FAxMA1−xPbI3 perovskite solar cells, the efficiency falls on a continuum when the FA content was increased from 0 to ∼60% (dipping for 25 min with a band gap of ∼1.545 eV). It means that the solvent induced film degradation surpasses the improvement of the light absorption. Further enhancing the MA substitution to ∼75% to form ∼FA0.75MA0.25PbI3 (∼25 min dipping) leads to a further increase of efficiency, which is mainly attributed to the enhanced Jsc and FF. With the dipping time prolonged from 30 to 240 min, the device performance dramatically degrades, which may be attributed to the formation of non-active and non-perovskite FAPbI3 nanorods on the film surface as shown in Fig. 4A. For the high temperature fabricated FAxMA1−xPbI3 perovskite solar cells, the average efficiency evolution tendency is similar to that fabricated at RT, but with narrowed efficiency distribution (Fig. 6B). The FAxMA1−xPbI3 PSCs fabricated with 3 min deliver the highest efficiency under our fabrication conditions. The decrease of the performance of the devices with dipping time extended from 3 to 10 min is ascribed to the distinct decrease of Voc and FF, which comes from the formation of pinhole structures on the film surface.

(B) The average device efficiency determined from reverse and forward J–V curves with a function of the measured band gap and calculated x in the compositional FAxMA1−xPbI3. Each average dataset is taken from at least 5 devices. (C) The J–V curves of the best FAxMA1−xPbI3 perovskite solar cells fabricated at RT and 60 °C, respectively, and (D) their corresponding EQE spectra. 

Fig. 6C shows the typical current density (J)–voltage (V) curve of the best perovskite solar cells fabricated at RT and 60 °C under one sun illumination. The improvement of the performance of high temperature processing devices is dominated by the enhancement of Voc, Jsc and FF as summarized in Table 1. The optimized FAxMA1−xPbI3 perovskite solar cells fabricated at RT and 60 °C deliver a Jsc of 21.10 mA cm−2 and 17.36 mA cm−2, which are close to the calculated 19.35 mA cm−2 and 15.56 mA cm−2 from the corresponding external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectrum in Fig. 6D. The little lower integrated current is possibly due to the short dwell times of the EQE measurement.17 In comparison with MAPbI3, the EQE edge of optimized FAxMA1−xPbI3 has extended from 784 nm to 814 nm, which is 30 nm red-shifted due to the alloying of FA in the perovskite structure (Fig. S9†). Although the recently reported dual FA, Br doping or triple Cs, FA, Br doping of MAPbI3 highly improves the performance of perovskite solar cells, their absorption ability is undesirably decreased to 800 nm or 775 nm (deduced from their EQE curves), respectively. The relatively wide absorption window of the FA-MA mixed triiodide perovskite demonstrates its great potential for highly efficient perovskite solar cells.

4. Conclusions
When the dipping temperature increases from RT to 60 °C, the cation diffusion speed of FA+ is extremely enhanced as the time constant is reduced from 42.5 min to 2.3 min. During the cation exchange process from MAPbI3 to black α-FAPbI3, the film morphology is almost preserved benefiting from the shortened dipping time and mild reaction conditions. As a result, the optimized FAxMA1−xPbI3 perovskite solar cell device in which the x value ≈ 0.75 presents the highest efficiency of 15.5% with reduced hysteresis. The unveiling of the phase stability of α-FAPbI3 in liquid solution, the enhanced organic cation exchange speed and film morphology preserving behavior indicate that dipping temperature control is extremely important for the solution processing of FAPbI3 perovskite films.

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  (A) Cation exchange between the original MAPbI3 perovskite film and FAI solution. The whole exchange reaction can be divided into the surface cation replacement and the inner cation diffusion. (B) Schematic illustration of the phase stability of FAPbI3 crystals in the solution.	 

 	Fig. 2  Kubelka–Munk spectra of mixed organic cation perovskite films after dipping treatment for different times at RT (A) and 60 °C (B), respectively. (C) Plots of the band gap against the dipping time at RT and 60 °C, which are fitted with an exponential decay.	 

 	Fig. 3  (A) X-ray diffraction pattern of mixed organic cation perovskite films magnified around 14.00° and (B) their corresponding full width at half maximum (FWHM). (C) The relationship among the band gap, lattice parameter, 110 peak position and x in the as-prepared compositional FAxMA1−xPbI3 films.	 

 	Fig. 4  SEM images of compositional FAxMA1−xPbI3 perovskite films fabricated at RT (A) and 60 °C (B), respectively. Scale bar is 500 nm.	 

 	Fig. 5  The two-dimensional grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (2DGIXRD) patterns of the original MA gas treated MAPbI3 film and the as-prepared FAxMA1−xPbI3 film after dipping at 60 °C for 10 min.	 

 	Fig. 6  (A) Cross-sectional SEM micrograph of the FA0.75MA0.25PbI3 perovskite solar cells with the perovskite layer fabricated at 60 °C for 3 min. (B) The average device efficiency determined from reverse and forward J–V curves with a function of the measured band gap and calculated x in the compositional FAxMA1−xPbI3. Each average dataset is taken from at least 5 devices. (C) The J–V curves of the best FAxMA1−xPbI3 perovskite solar cells fabricated at RT and 60 °C, respectively, and (D) their corresponding EQE spectra.
