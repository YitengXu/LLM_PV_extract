    , Accepted 23rd May 2021First published on 19th June 2021AbstractPhthalocyanines (Pcs) are interesting molecules offering fascinating chemistry that has received tremendous interest in the last decade. Certain features, such as high thermal, chemical, and optical stability, as well as unique electrochemical, photochemical and photophysical properties have opened a multitude of applications, ranging from photodynamic therapy in cancer treatment, chemical sensors, solar cells, nonlinear optics, and recently to photoinitiating systems for free-radical, cationic and controlled radical polymerizations. The success story of Pcs prompted us to highlight their significant role in photopolymerization and in materials science. In the present review, we first report on the structural design and synthesis of Pcs for specific applications and then focus on some innovative works that exploit the multiple activating properties of these macrocycles for the initiation of various modes of polymerizations under light exposure.
1. Introduction
To date, various natural and synthetic dyes have been extensively used as multifunctional and light sensitive materials. Phthalocyanine (Pc), having a conjugated 18 π electron system (Fig. 1), known as one of the most efficient artificial dyes, closely resembles naturally existing porphyrins.1 These structures have high thermal, chemical, and optical stability as well as unique electrochemical, photochemical and photophysical properties.
 Fig. 1  Molecular structure (a) and absorption spectrum (b) of MPc. 
A typical absorption spectrum of a metal phthalocyanine (MPc), presented in Fig. 1b, shows an intense absorption band, corresponding to the HOMO–LUMO π–π* transitions in the visible region at about 670 nm (Q-band), and a weak band around 350 nm (Soret or B-band). The high degree of conjugation of these structures generally leads to high molar absorption coefficients. The strong absorption of their Q-band constitutes a real asset, as many applications require the use of low-intensity near-infrared (NIR) light.2 Modification of the Pc macro ring (α or β position), changing the metal atom in the center or the addition of an axial ligand to the central metal atom results in the desired electrochemical and spectroscopic properties.3 It is worth mentioning that a number of theoretical studies and a textbook on the absorption characteristics of Pcs have been published.4
Phthalocyanines (Pcs) constitute an infinite library for designing molecules with promising photochemical and photophysical properties. Although their syntheses have already been well documented, new strategies continue to appear as fast as interest in them is growing. Indeed, the versatility of Pcs encourages their application in various fields, namely, as photodynamic therapy agents in cancer treatment,5 chemical sensors,6,7 solar cells,8 nonlinear optics,9 and more rarely as photoinitiators (PIs) for polymerization.10 With the increasing search for visible light and NIR absorbing dyes for polymerization, some interesting and innovative examples of Pcs as photoinitiators (PIs) have recently been reported.11,12 Interestingly, some of these studies have demonstrated the superior abilities of Pcs in roles such as preventing oxygen inhibition for initiating polymerization, eliminating bacteria for photodynamic therapy treatment, and generating nanoparticles.
In this review, we aim to reflect the design of Pcs for photopolymerization applications. A detailed report on the current syntheses of Pcs highlights their various preparation methods. Through an intensive discussion of the performance optimization of Pcs, some structural characteristics that would improve the electrochemical and photochemical properties of Pcs are identified. Examples of Pc-based photoinitiation systems are presented with a special focus on innovative works that exploit the multiple properties of these macrocycles.
2. Synthetic strategies and overview of recent approaches
Pcs are generally obtained through cyclotetramerization reactions of precursors (Fig. 2) such as phthalic acid (Pa), phthalic anhydride (Pan), phthalimide (Pi) (Method VIII), 2-cyanobenzamide (Cb) (Method XI), phthalonitrile (Pn) (Methods I, II, and III for H2Pc or Methods V, VI, and VII for MPc), 1,3-diiminoisoindoline (Di) (Method IV) and 1,2-dibromobenzene (Br) (Method X) or their derivatives in high boiling solvents according to the methods applied. The general methods applied are outlined in Fig. 2. The most common method used to obtain metal-centered phthalocyanine (MPc) is the cyclotetramerization of phthalonitrile, which is favored by the template effect of the metal (Methods V, VI, and VII). However, for metal-free Pcs (H2Pc), 1,3-diiminoisoindoline is the most preferred precursor (Methods IV). Notably, inserting a metal into the central cavity of H2Pc (Method XII) or replacing the unstable metal ion(s) with a more robust metal (Method XIII) are used as alternative methodologies. These basic commonly applied methods are presented below.
 Fig. 2  General synthesis of metal-free phthalocyanine (H2Pc) and metallo phthalocyanine (MPc). Roman numerals indicate the method; the dotted arrows indicate the connections between precursors. 
2.1. Method I: PcH2 synthesis from phthalonitrile precursor and base
This method is based on the thermal cyclotetramerization of a phthalonitrile precursor with a base (e.g. DBU, DBN and NH3) in a solvent (e.g. n-hexane-1-ol) or using a basic solvent, such as N,N-dimethylamino-ethanol (DMAE). The method is coined the “Tomoda method” as it was first applied by Tomoda.13
2.2. Method II: PcH2 synthesis from phthalonitrile precursor by subsequent removal of unstable metal cations
According to this method, some metal cations (e.g. Li+, Na+, K+, Mg2+, Be2+, Hg2+ and Pb2+), which cannot be held in the cavity of the Pc ring, are easily removed from the Pc by the effect of an acid.14 In particular, the “Linstead method” is used, where lithium, sodium and magnesium alkoxides are used for cyclotetramerization. Following completion of the reaction, metal cations are readily removed from the MPc to form H2Pc in acidic medium.
2.3. Method III: PcH2 synthesis from phthalonitrile precursor using a reducing agent
This method is based on a redox reaction facilitated by an inexpensive organic reducing agent such as hydroquinone. The cyclotetramerization of phthalonitrile is achieved at elevated temperatures (>180 °C), at which phthalonitrile melts, by using an inexpensive organic reducer such as hydroquinone.17
2.4. Method IV: H2Pc synthesis from diiminoisoindoline precursor
Through this method, H2Pc is formed by the cyclotetramerization of 1,3-diiminoisoindoline (Di), which can be obtained by adding ammonia to phthalonitrile, generally in the presence of a refluxing solution of 2-dimethylaminoethanol (DMAE).16
2.5. Method V: Metal Pc (MPc) synthesis from phthalonitrile precursor in the bulk reaction
For this methodology, three approaches can be considered. The first method concerns microwave irradiation in a solvent free medium, providing several advantages including environmentally friendly conditions, high efficiency and ease of application.17 Alternatively, a similar reaction can be conducted in a solvent. Through the third approach, both unsubstituted and substituted MPcs can be obtained by heating phthalonitrile at above 200 °C in the presence of a metal or metal salt without solvent.18 However, this method is suitable only for precursors with thermally stable substituents. Moreover, it also suffers from the monohalogenation of the Pc when certain metal halides, such as CuCI2 and FeCI3, are used.
2.6. Method VI: MPc synthesis from phthalonitrile precursor in a solvent
Through this method, MPc can be obtained by cyclotetramerization of phthalonitrile in the presence of appropriate metal salts in high boiling solvents, such as DMAE, DMF (N,N-dimethylmethylformamide) and 1-chloronaphthalene.19 With this method, the problems associated with monohalogenation of Pc can be avoided.
2.7. Method VII: MPc synthesis from phthalonitrile precursor in the presence of base in a solvent
This method, which utilizes a phthalonitrile precursor, metal salt and a base such as DBU or DBN, is one of the most effective and frequently used methods. Successful cyclotetramerization is achieved with solvents such as pentanol or hexanol.6
2.8. Method VIII: MPc synthesis from phthalimide (Pi), phthalic acid (Pa), or phthalic anhydride (Pan) precursors
Phthalimide, phthalic anhydride, or phthalic acid are highly suitable precursors for this method. A suitably selected metal salt in combination with urea and ammonium molybdate as the nitrogen source and catalyst are used in the process. The reactions can be conducted in solvent20 or under solvent-free conditions by microwave irradiation.21 Phthalic acid is converted into phthalimide via phthalic anhydride and these two intermediates are isolated from the reaction. It is also possible to obtain substituted Pcs with this method.20
2.9. Method IX: MPc synthesis from diiminoisoindoline precursor
Through this method, which is a minor modification of method IV, MPc can be obtained by adding a suitable metal salt.22
2.10. Method X: copper phthalocyanine (CuPc) synthesis from 1,2-dibromobenzene precursor
The method developed by Rosenmund–von Braun is a common route to synthesize Pcs from a copper metal salt with phthalonitrile precursors obtained from dibromide derivatives. This reaction is usually carried out by heating the dibromide with CuCN in the presence of a solvent such as DMF or quinoline. Generally, 1,2-dibromobenzene derivatives directly yield Pcs without conversion into phthalonitrile. By changing the reaction conditions i.e., high concentrations, the yield can be significantly increased.23
2.11. Method XI: MPc synthesis from 2-cyanobenzamide precursor
Cyclotetramerization of 2-cyanobenzamide in the presence of a suitable metal or metal salt successfully yields substituted MPc. This method can be conducted in both solvent medium and under solvent-free conditions.24 Notably, this method is not suitable for the synthesis of substituted Pc derivatives.
2.12. Method XII: MPc from PcH2
This highly efficient method is based on the complexing of H2Pc with many metal ions. This is especially suitable for Pc derivatives that are soluble in organic solvents.25
2.13. Method XIII: MPc via metal exchange
This method, suitable for the preparation of insoluble unsubstituted MPcs, involves the exchange of unstable ions, such as Li+ and Na+, with metals. The desired Pcs are readily obtained as a result of the rapid precipitation process in the reaction mixture.26
2.14. Substitution or modification method: Pc from preformed Pc
A method involving substitution or modification of a previously synthesized Pc offers a conceptually different approach to obtain Pc derivatives. The method is often industrially applied for standard aromatic substitution reactions, such as halogenation, sulfonylation and nitration of Pcs. The formation of complex product mixtures as a consequence of sixteen possible substitution positions is a deterrent to using the method. However, the introduction of functional groups that do not withstand the harsh conditions required for the classical cyclotetramerization method, or the ability to replace groups in previously synthesized Pcs, make this method very attractive.27
2.15. Phthalocyanine and metal-including derivatives
Pcs are macrocyclic ligands with a structure that can place any type of metal in the central cavity and adapt to the bonded central metal (Fig. 3). In addition, Pcs appear as a complex with additional ligands when necessary, depending on the type of central metal atom (Fig. 4). The H2Pc molecule forms a complex with alkali metals, where two metal ions are coordinated by the Pc macrocycle. The central cavity is not large enough to accommodate two cations. Because of this situation, alkali metals located outside of the Pc plane are easily replaced with metals that can interact more strongly with the Pc ring. Metals with a +2 charge form a stable complex with the Pc ring without the need for an additional ligand, but, in some cases, neutral ligands such as H2O and pyridine can bind to the central metal.28 Large M2+ ions such as Pb2+ do not enter the Pc central cavity completely but sit atop the ligand.29
 Fig. 3  Metal complex types of Pc macro ring without ligand participation. 
 Fig. 4  Metal complex types of Pc macro ring with ligand participation. 
Metal cations with +3 or higher oxidation number tend to bind “axial” ligands (Fig. 4). Larger cations from the lanthanide30 and actinide31 groups are suitable for making a “sandwich” complex in the form of Pc2M, with two Pcs encircling the same ion, rather than being hosted by the Pc ring (Fig. 3). Another common type of complex is the “triple-decker sandwich” complex consisting of three Pcs and two large metal ions (M2Pc3 in Fig. 3).32
The synthetic methodologies described below for symmetrical metallo or metal-free Pcs are summarized in Table 1.

2.16. Symmetrically organized phthalocyanines

2.16.1. Tetrasubstituted Pcs. 
Cyclotetramerization of 3- and 4-substituted phthalonitriles is generally preferred for the synthesis of tetrasubstituted Pcs. Other phthalyl derivatives can also be used. If steric and electronic effects are neglected, a mixture of four structural isomers with D2h, C4h, C2v and Cs symmetries is obtained. The ratio of these isomers obtained is expected to be 1:1:2:4, respectively, for both non-peripherally and peripherally tetrasubstituted Pc. The presence of isomers positively affects the distribution of the crystalline order and thus increases the solubility. Separation of these isomers can be done by HPLC.
Non-peripherally substituted Pcs as a mixture of isomers (D2h, C4h, C2v and Cs) of these compounds can be obtained with 3-substituted phthalonitrile (Fig. 5). Typical examples are given in Table 2. The use of steric or electronic effects can significantly affect the proportion of isomers and the yield.43 Due to the intense aggregation of tetrasubstituted Pc isomers in solution, separation is rather difficult, but it can be achieved by chromatographic techniques.

2.16.2. Octasubstituted phthalocyanines. 
Octasubstituted Pcs with substituents in nonperipheral or peripheral positions (Fig. 7) are usually formed from the phthalonitrile or phthalyl derivatives as symmetrical structures with two substituents. The solubility of octasubstituted Pcs in organic solvents is generally lower than that of tetrasubstituted analogues.
 Fig. 7  Non-peripherally (a) and peripherally (b) octasubstituted Pcs. 
Non-peripherally octasubstituted Pcs containing a central metal atom are generally obtained by cyclotetramerization of 3,6-disubstituted phthalonitriles through the template effect of the metal ion. Another way is through the metal insertion reaction of the metal-free Pc. In this case, the initial cyclotetramerization reaction is performed without using metal ions. Diiminoisoindoline derivatives are not suitable for non-peripherally substituted Pc synthesis, since the formation of diiminoisoindoline from 3,6-disubstituted phthalonitrile is quite difficult due to steric effects. Some examples with bound groups are given in Table 4.

Bulky groups in the non-peripheral positions of Pc can create steric hindrance, which reduces the yield of the reaction considerably. In some cases, depending on steric hindrance, cyclotetramerization may not even occur. However, the alkyl and alkoxy units attached to these positions result in excellent dissolution of Pcs in organic solvents. In addition, because of the symmetry of the precursor the obtained Pcs are single isomers. Alkoxy units at these positions cause an important bathochromic shift of the Q-band (>750 nm).43
Peripherally octasubstituted Pcs containing a central metal atom are usually obtained by cyclotetramerization of 4,5-disubstituted phthalonitriles or diiminoisoindolines through the template effect of the metal ion. Notably, this template effect is not used to obtain metal-free Pcs. The introduction of functional groups that cannot withstand the harsh conditions required for the classical cyclotetramerization method, or the ability to replace groups of previously synthesized Pcs, are also useful methods for preparing octasubstituted Pcs. Some examples with bound groups are given in Table 5. The presence of steric effects does not affect the reaction yield significantly, and the products are isomerically pure. In addition, 2:3, 9:10, 16:17, 23:24-bridged Pc derivatives have been frequently used. Such bridged structures usually contain crown ethers or other members of the aza and thia macrocyclic units.6,35

2.16.3. Hexadecasubstituted phthalocyanines. 
The low level of aggregation and high solubility of these types of Pcs enable them to be used frequently. These Pcs, which contain heteroatoms in non-peripheral positions, absorb light in the NIR region; this facilitates their usage in many application areas. 3,4,5,6-Substituted phthalonitriles are used as starting materials for hexadeca Pcs, and any hexadeca Pcs can be obtained, according to the bound groups in these positions. Due to steric effects, di-iminoisoindoline formation from a phthalonitrile containing heteroatoms in non-peripheral positions is prevented; thus, diiminoisoindoline cannot be used as a precursor. In addition, steric crowding often results in reduced yields for the formation of hexadeca Pcs. Typical examples are given in Table 6.

2.17. Unsymmetrically organized phthalocyanines
Unsymmetrical Pcs are more interesting for specific applications, despite the fact that symmetrical Pcs may have limitations on use. Many studies have been carried out for the synthesis of unsymmetrical Pcs and various synthetic routes have been proposed. However, their purification process, compared with symmetrical Pcs, is tedious. For the preparation of unsymmetrical Pcs via two different phthalonitrile or iminoisoindoline units containing different substituents, five different procedures are reported.

2.17.1. The statistical condensation method. 
This is the preferred method for preparing of A3B type unsymmetrically structured Pcs containing three of the same subunits and one differently derivatized isoindole subunit. According to this procedure, after the statistical condensation reaction of two differently modified phthalonitrile or diiminoisoindole units,73–78 chromatographic separation is performed to obtain AAAA, BBBB, AAAB, ABBB, AABB and ABAB type compounds (A and B represent different types of isoindole subunits).74 Representative examples of A3B-type Pcs are given in Fig. 8.75
 Fig. 8  A series of unsymmetrical Pc examples. 
For this method, stoichiometry is extremely important: an excess of one of the reactants is generally used (3:1 molar ratio) and an isomeric mixture is obtained by ensuring that the A3B type Pc is in excess. The disadvantage of the method is that symmetrical Pc formation, which consists of the precursor present in excess, is generally high. Moreover, chromatographic separation of isomeric mixtures is very challenging. The positions and electronic characteristics of the attached groups also affect the ratio of the product obtained. For this reason, the statistical ratio of the precursors should carefully be adjusted.
Assuming that A is less reactive than B, a molar ratio of A:B of 9:1 or even higher77,78 has to be used to obtain the A3B type Pc. Condensation of 3,6-bulky group modified phthalonitriles, in which steric factors are highly effective, with other differently modified phthalonitriles, provides a reduction in the number of products. Such steric hindrance reduces aggregation and facilitates chromatographic separation.


2.17.2. The subphthalocyanine expansion method. 
Another method used to obtain unsymmetrical A3B type Pcs over the past few decades was the ring expansion reaction of pre-formed subphthalocyanines (three-unit macrocycle, Fig. 9) with 1,3-diiminoisondoline derivatives.79 These reactions are highly dependent on the experimental conditions and reactants. In addition, the expansion reactions of the subphthalocyanines were shown to be multi-step reactions, which were dependent on many factors, rather than a selective reaction. It should be pointed out that challenges of the preparation and purification steps of subphthalocyanines and the use of a limited number of functional groups significantly limit the use of this method.80

2.17.3. Polymer supported synthesis. 
An alternative method for obtaining unsymmetrical Pcs is the polymer supported method. According to this method, the phthalonitrile or 1,3-diiminoisoindoline unit is attached to an insoluble polymer, which is then reacted with a different soluble phthalonitrile or diiminoisoindoline unit. Finally, the polymer is detached by acid treatment to essentially give the unsymmetrical A3B type Pc.81,82Fig. 10 shows the general synthesis method for polymer supported unsymmetrical A3B type Pcs. The disadvantage of this method is the use of diiminoisoindoline or phthalonitrile, which can readily react with the polymer.

2.17.4. Cross-condensation. 
The most effective method for obtaining unsymmetrical ABAB type Pcs is the condensation of the 1,3-diiminoisoindoline derivative with the 1,3,3-trichloro-isoindolenine through reductive coupling of the diiminoisoindoline derivative and the chloro compound in a molar ratio of 1:1 (Fig. 11).83 Another method is the cross condensation of 1,3-diiminosoindoline and 1H-isoindole-1,3-(2H)dithione in a 1:1 molar ratio.84 In addition to the ABAB type Pc, trace amounts of other possible Pcs may also be formed.

2.17.5. “Half-Pc” intermediate method. 
Leznoff et al. suggested the “half-Pc” intermediate method for obtaining AABB type unsymmetrical Pcs.85 According to this method, the isolated “half-Pc” reacts with another phthalonitrile under very mild conditions to form the AABB type asymmetric Pc (Fig. 12).

2.18. Multinuclear systems
Recent studies demonstrated that multinuclear Pcs offered an extremely interesting design platform. The structures formed by combining the same or different types of subunits are widely used in many different applications through electronic or photonic interactions between these subunits. Leznoff et al. have extensively studied bi- and tetra-nuclear Pcs, which are covalently bound to many different bridges with varying numbers of atoms (Fig. 13).86,87 Such multinuclear structures are generally obtained by statistical cross-condensation of the corresponding bis-1,3-diiniinoisodinoline or bisphthalonitrile, where two benzene units are connected by the bridge and another suitable 1,3-diiniinoisoindoline or phthalonitrile unit.
 Fig. 13  Binuclear and tetranuclear Pc examples with different X bridges. 
Besides, Pcs attached to rigid structures such as alkenyl,88 alkynyl,88 and butadienyl89 form dimeric arrays. In this way, elongation of electronic communication between the two Pc units is facilitated by extended conjugation (Fig. 14). One of the most important methods for the formation of the alkynyl bridged system is the palladium catalyzed cross-coupling reaction of Pcs containing iodo and ethynyl groups (Fig. 15).90 Differently derivatized binuclear compounds containing different metals can be obtained through this method.
 Fig. 14  Synthesis of multinuclear Pcs with alkenyl or alkynyl bridges. 
 Fig. 15  Synthesis of alkynyl-bridged multinuclear Pcs. 
For the synthesis of multi-nuclear polymeric Pcs, two discrete approaches are reported. The first method involves the reaction of tetrasubstituted low molecular mass polymerizable end group containing Pcs.91 An alternative route concerns the polycondensation reaction of tetracarboxylic acid or tetracarbonitrile derivatives.92 Although applied by various groups, the latter suffers from difficulties associated with the purification and characterization processes due to the limited solubility of the planar polymerized Pcs in organic solvents.
Fusing and keeping the aromatic subunits in the same plane maximize π overlap. In recent years, these types of multinuclear Pcs, synthesized through various methods, have been widely used. Interesting complexes such as binuclear and trinuclear with a benzene bridge,93 binuclear with a pyrazine bridge,94 binuclear with a naphthalene bridge (with the same or different metals),95 binuclear with an anthracene bridge,96 and sandwich type binuclear Pc97 complexes are compiled in Table 7. Depending on the desired application, the appropriate synthesis strategy may be selected.

Due to easy synthesis procedures, numerous phthalocyanines are commercially available. Some of them were used as photoinitiators for polymerization. Typical examples include simple macrocycles with various metal centers, such as ZnPc,98,99 MgPc100 or AlPc,101 but also macrocycles with tert-butyl side groups.99 Phthalocyanines possessing easily modifiable side groups (–CO2H, –NH2, –Cl) offer further design possibilities, opening huge opportunities for developing new photoinitiators.
3. Designing Pcs for photopolymerization: criteria
Several aspects are considered in the design of PIs capable of initiating various modes of polymerization. Obviously, the photochemical properties will play an important role in their performance. To ensure high reactivity with co-initiators or monomers, redox potentials and solubility parameters should also be considered. Tuning Pcs by judiciously choosing their structure, substituents and complexed metal can help to accomplish better performances.
3.1 Photophysical properties
The performances of Pcs as photosensitizers (PSs) are strongly related to their absorption/emission and photochemical/photophysical characteristics. By selecting the number of substituents and their positions, as well as the number of cycles or complexed metal ions, one can reasonably adjust the Pc system to attain the desired wavelength and suitability for specific reactions. In this section, the role of structural parameters on the photophysical and photochemical properties is discussed. A Jablonski diagram referring the photophysical processes resulting from light absorption is shown in Fig. 16.
 Fig. 16  Jablonski diagram (Abs represents absorption, Fl represents fluorescence, Ph represents phosphorescence). Modified from ref. 110. 
Photophysical and photochemical properties strongly depend on the absorption wavelength. Although most visible-light PIs are absorbing in the near-UV region or below 500 nm, the advantage of Pcs is that their Q-band is located at a high wavelength. Due to the low energy and less harmful conditions, in most applications, Pcs with NIR absorption and emission characteristics are preferred.2 Such spectral extension can be achieved in several ways:
(i) Increase in π-conjugation and/or expansion of the macrocycle.102 Extension of π-conjugation and/or expansion of the macrocycle decreases the separation between the HOMO and LUMO energy levels, which essentially results in a bathochromic shift. However, these “π-electron-modified” Pcs are sensitive to air due to their tendency to oxidation.1
(ii) Substitution positions (peripheral or non-peripheral positions of Pc) and substituent numbers (tetra, octa, and hexadeca).103
For instance, the grafting of alkoxy units onto symmetrical non-peripherally octasubstituted Pcs (1, 4, 8, 11, 15, 18, 22, 25) causes an important bathochromic shift of the Q-band (>750 nm).43 This is also the case when incorporating electron donating groups, such as sulphur or amino groups, at non-peripheral positions.104
(iii) Oligomerization of Pcs, which also causes expansion of the macrocycle.105
(iv) Changing the central metal atom in the cavity of the Pc.1
Even if the absorption of macrocycles is mainly due to the π-conjugated system, this also depends on the complexed metal ion. For instance, Ni2+, Co3+or Fe3+ can induce charge transfer between the metal and the π-conjugated system,106 which modifies the absorption properties. This is not the case for the most used ion, Zn2+, as complexation has a positive but moderate effect. In contrast, Si-complexed Pcs have no influence on the absorption characteristics.107 The effect of charge transfer on the redox properties is discussed separately (vide infra, see section 3.2)
(v) Lowering of molecular symmetry as a result of decreasing the energy of the LUMO by splitting.108
A great advantage of Pc macrocycles compared with classical PS is their high molar absorption coefficient. However, high absorption is not systematically related to higher initiation efficiency. In addition, it seems to be difficult to distinguish a correlation as absorption is reliant on solvent. Notably, absorption properties can be higher in the monomer in the presence of additives.109
Regarding the properties at excited states, it is generally preferable to have a high intersystem crossing (ISC) efficiency, a high triplet state quantum yield (ΦΔ) and a long triplet state lifetime (τT) to maximize the reactivity of PIs.106 Indeed, by staying longer in the excited state, the reaction probability of the PS is increased. Childress et al. reported that the complexed Zn2+ ion could induce an increase of the spin–orbit coupling, thus resulting in an improvement of the ISC.99 Despite the high ISC, interconversion from the lowest π−π* singlet state to a low (dd) of the metal can be detrimental to the lifetime of excited species, as reported for Ni-complexed porphyrins.106 Also, spin-orbit interactions with paramagnetic transition metals such as Co2+ or Fe3+ may shorten the triplet lifetime.106 Functionalization of the Pc can also have an impact on the ISC efficiency.111 However, a long triplet excited state can induce side reactions with oxygen, for example. Indeed, the oxygen ground state has a natural triplet configuration, allowing it to undergo energy transfer from an excited PS in the triplet state. The interaction between PS and oxygen occurs following two main mechanisms, resulting in the formation of either radical species (Type I mechanism) or excited singlet oxygen (Type II mechanism); the second is the most encountered. Both mechanisms are detailed further. Quenching by oxygen may not only slow down the photochemical reaction but can also result in a photobleaching process. This phenomenon depends on the considered molecule, as well as concentration, light intensity, and solvent. It may ultimately lead to oxidative degradation of the photosensitizer to its lower mass fragments.112 Highly reactive 1O2 can react with MPcs, resulting in degradation of the macrocyclic structure to form phthalimide as a photooxidation product (Fig. 17).110,113 Photobleaching results in a decrease of the absorption of Pc, which is detrimental to its reactivity. Consequently, singlet oxygen quantum yield (ΦΔ), corresponding to the amount of singlet oxygen produced per light quantum, is a critical factor for the selection of photosensitizers.
 Fig. 17  Photodegradation process of Pc in the presence of singlet oxygen (1O2). Modified from ref. 110. 
Despite their generally high ΦΔ, the photobleaching of Pcs can be quite limited, particularly when irradiation is carried out on the Q-band of the Pc molecule.99 This opens opportunities for several applications, which will be described further (section 4).
The reaction of Pcs in the singlet state cannot be excluded. Fluorescence properties, such as fluorescence quantum yields, lifetimes, and spectral shifts of MPc, can be influenced by many parameters such as the central metal atom, nature of the solvent, aggregation, pH, photoinduced electron transfer (PET) or electronic energy transfer reactions.
The related photophysical and photochemical properties of selected water soluble and insoluble Pcs are given in Tables 8 and 9. Readers are encouraged to refer to ref. 110 for more extensive examples.

3.2. Redox properties
Photosensitization reactions generally occur through electron transfer between the PS and a co-initiator. Thus, oxidation and reduction potentials are crucial characteristics. Highly conjugated macrocycles have exceptional oxido-reduction properties, due to the possible stabilization of charges by delocalization. Initiation can follow a reductive pathway (Pc abstracts an electron) or an oxidative pathway (Pc gives an electron), depending on the applied co-initiator. Therefore, oxidation and reduction potentials of Pcs are important to design PIs with good performances. The relationship between Pc structures and their redox properties was extensively studied by Lever's team at the end of the last century using cyclic voltammetry and ESR.142–147 Here, we will focus on the first oxidation and reduction processes only, as they are likely to be involved in the initiation process.
It is well known that metal-free Pcs exhibit several reduction and oxidation waves corresponding to the macrocyclic ring.148,149 Some metal Pcs strongly influence the oxidation and reduction potentials. For most classical metal-complexed Pcs (Zn2+ and Mg2+), the metal ion is not involved in the first oxidation and reduction processes. Indeed, metal ions such as Zn2+ or Mg2+ already have stable d10 and P6 electronic configurations, which do not permit them to donate an electron. The electron is more likely to be taken or generated by the π-electron system, contrary to classical ruthenium or iridium photocatalysts in which metal to ligand charge transfer (MLCT) occurs.150
However, Lever et al. established a correlation between the first ring oxidation or reduction process, and the polarizing power of the metal ion.142 The latter is calculated from the ratio of the charge over the radius of the metal ion (Z/r). It appears that a more polarizing metal ion (more positive and smaller) makes it more difficult to oxidize Pc and it is more easily reduced. For instance, XAlPc species are easier to reduce and more difficult to oxidize than MgPc as a result of Al3+ having a greater polarizing power than Mg2+ and Zn2+. Another explanation for this trend would be the trivalent character of Al3+, which would stabilize electrons145 and increase the reduction potential compared with those of divalent Zn2+ and Mg2+ ions.
In some cases, the metal ion is oxidized or reduced before the Pc ring.143 It can be characterized from the absorption spectrum as a LMCT band in the IR region, lower in energy than the Pc Q-band. Lever et al. demonstrated that, in this kind of system (Cr3+, Fe3+, Mn3+), no reduction of methyl viologen was observed, as energy was lost through ISC from the Q-band to the LMCT one. Electrochemical data of selected Pc complexes with redox-active and redox-inactive metals are given in Tables 10 and 11.142,143,151–166

All these results were confirmed by polymerization experiments carried out later (see section 4). Polymerizations can successfully be realized by using metal-free Pcs.99 When a reductive pathway is expected, complexation by Cu2+ (d9 configuration) annihilates the initiation properties of the Pc due to the electron scavenger effect. This was notably emphasized in the study of Childress et al.,99 where no polymerization was observed in the presence of copper(II) 2,9,16,23-tetra-tert-butyl29H,31H-phthalocyanine (CuTTP), whereas high conversions were obtained for metal-free phthalocyanine (TTP) and zinc phthalocyanine (ZnTTP). Also, Boyer et al. emphasized the influence of changing the metal on the performances of Pc derivatives, by comparing AlPc to ZnPc and MgPc.100 Initiation, occurring through a reductive pathway, proved to be more efficient in the presence of AlPc, which was easier to reduce, as expected.
Regarding trivalent or tetravalent metal ions, axial ligands may also influence the redox properties.147 When no other ligand is competing, solvent can bind to the metal ion. Generally, an electron donating ligand or solvent will facilitate ring oxidation and attenuate ring reduction through charge stabilization. In a study by Lever et al., substituent effects on the redox potentials of MPcs were successfully correlated with Hammett parameters.146 The team even proposed a two-dimensional relationship to predict the redox properties of Pcs, depending on both Hammett parameters and axially bound ligands.147
Despite the relevance of this model, the impact of substituents on the photoinitiating properties of Pcs was poorly studied. Childress et al. highlighted a potential effect of steric hindrance by comparing ZnTPP to ZnPc (see section 4).99 Also, it was hypothesized that some substituents could stabilize charges, facilitating an electronic exchange reaction with additives by limiting back-electron transfer.
3.3. Solubility
Solubility constitutes a major limiting factor for the use of Pcs as photosensitizers. Indeed, they are prone to aggregation due to π–π interactions between macrocycles. Aggregation is a kind of coplanar association of rings, usually occurring by creating dimers or higher order structures from the monomer structure, that depends on parameters such as concentration, structure of bound groups, type of solvent, type of central metal atom and the temperature of media. In the aggregated form of Pc, the electronic structures of the ground state and the excited state are altered as a result of the disorder of the electronic structure of the Pc ring.
The spectroscopic behaviors of aggregates differ according to the relative geometry of the macrocyclic structures. Face-to-face (sandwich) aggregation is known as H-type, while the less common head-to-tail aggregation is known as J-type aggregation, and its optical properties differ greatly.167 H-type aggregates have a maximum absorption in the blue region compared with the monomeric structure and in most cases are non-fluorescent. This non-emissive character is due to the transition of non-parallel dipole moments with a prohibited transition to the molecular ground state. J-type aggregates, on the other hand, have a maximum absorption in the red region compared with the monomer and are generally fluorescent, sometimes with an even higher absorption than that of the monomer (Fig. 18).167 In addition, these two types of aggregation can be distinguished from the angle Q, which is identified as the angle between the molecular transition dipole moment of the monomer and the molecular central line of the aggregate. While H aggregates are formed as a result of Q >54.7°, J aggregates are formed when Q <54.7°.110 In either case, the transition from the ground state to higher and lower exciton states is allowed. MPc sensitizers forming dimers and higher aggregates reduce photosensitization efficiency and the MPc's excited state lifetime. In addition, quantum efficiencies of excited states and singlet oxygen production decrease.168

Thus, the photoinitiation properties of Pc-based systems can be considerably altered by aggregation and conducting polymerizations in the bulk or in solution. Thus, the choice of substituents and adapting the metal ion to the reaction medium is critical. Highly substituted Pcs, such as hexadecasubstituted phthalocyanines, are particularly suitable for avoiding aggregation.
The coordination of the central metal ion to axial ligands could also limit aggregation. Consequently, metal ions preferring six-coordination, such as Fe3+ or Co3+, considerably enhance the solubility of Pc compared with Fe2+ and Co2+, which have four-coordination. Also, a tetravalent Si4+ ion permits carbon chains to be added on each side of the macrocycle; one example was realized by Lalevée et al. who synthesized a bis(octanoate)silicon phthalocyanine ((OCT)2-SiPc) and used it as a photoinitiator (see section 4).107
In some solvents, the complexation of Pcs to metals with strong Lewis acidity could contribute to their solubilization. According to the study of Ghani et al. on the solubility of unsubstituted metal Pcs, it is expected that donor solvents containing oxygen favor the solubilization MPcs.169 Indeed, the Lewis acidity of the complexed metal can also enhance solubility due to coordination with the solvent, as observed for AlPc in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) (see section 4).100 The coordination mechanism is presented in Fig. 19.

Also, the ability of the metal to complex with the monomer could facilitate polymerization but needs further investigation.
4. Reported uses of Pcs as photosensitizers for polymerization
As stated, Pcs have found applications in many fields, but quite recently their potential as PSs for photopolymerization, either in solution or in the bulk, has been a topic of interest. They are detailed in the following paragraphs.
4.1. RAFT polymerization
Examples of Pcs used for RAFT polymerization were reported by Boyer's team. These authors proposed a photoinduced electron transfer mechanism (Fig. 20).100 Once excited upon visible or NIR light irradiation, Pc abstracts an electron from the NMP solvent. When oxidized, the latter generates a radical able to initiate polymerization of (meth)acrylate and (meth)acrylamide monomers. If conventional polymerization were to occur, by addition of a RAFT agent, such as 2-(n-butyltrithiocarbonate)propionic acid, these polymerizations would proceed in a controlled manner and polymers with low molar weight distributions would be obtained. This reductive quenching pathway differs from classical photoinduced RAFT polymerization because there is no electron transfer between the photocatalyst and the RAFT agent. As NMP is involved in the initiation step, no polymerization occurs with Pcs in other solvents. Polymerizations were successfully carried out with blue, green, red or NIR (780 nm, 850 nm) light sources. Appreciable oxygen tolerance observed with these systems was attributed to the Pc anions. The influence of metal complexation was evaluated by comparing the reactivity of Mg, Zn, and Al-complexed Pcs (Q-band at 675 nm with εmax between 20000 and 30000 M−1 cm−1). Polymerization was observed in the presence of all metal Pcs, with significantly higher rate constants in the case of AlPc. As explained in the discussion above, this could be attributed to several phenomena, such as complexation of NMP to the metal ion. Also, the high polarizing power and trivalent character of the Al3+ ion make AlPc easier to reduce (Ered = −0.66 V) than MgPc (Ered = −0.92 V) and ZnPc (Ered = −0.86 V).

In another work, Boyer et al. focused on the use of Pc for polymerizations at high wavelength: far red (l = 680 nm) and NIR (l = 780 and 850 nm).101 By changing aluminium phthalocyanine (λmax = 679 nm) to more conjugated aluminium naphthalocyanine (λmax = 783 nm), irradiation could be shifted to higher wavelengths. Initiating alkoxy radicals are generated through the photosensitization of endoperoxides followed by O–O bond cleavage. Three endoperoxides (urea hydrogen peroxide, tert-butyl hydroperoxide and benzoyl peroxide) in conjunction with two RAFT agents (DTPA and CDTPA) were studied in detail and their performances were compared. Unprecedented control was observed for the polymerization of (meth)acrylate and (meth)acrylamide monomers. Also, irradiation at high wavelength penetrates deeper into the material, making polymerization through barriers possible (see section 5.2).
4.2. Free-radical and cationic photopolymerizations in the bulk
Pc-based photoinitiating systems were also proposed for FRP and CP operating with various mechanisms. A strategy to turn Pc into a visible-light sensitive Type II PI involves the incorporation of the related PI into the macrocycle to enhance the related electron transfer process. The first example was presented by Arsu et al. who used a thioxanthone-ZnPc (Fig. 21A).111 Due to the Type II-initiator nature of this derivative, the addition of an amine co-initiator (electron and H donor) was required to initiate polymerization. Its combination with a conventional hydrogen donor, N-methyldiethanol amine (MDEA), led to the successful FRP of methyl methacrylate in THF under irradiation with a xenon lamp. It was emphasized that polymerization had to be conducted under oxygen free conditions, since Pc reacted in its triplet state. The advantages of using a TX-functionalized Pc compared with basic TX are many. First, the absorption in the visible range is increased. Then, the π–π* nature of the Pc triplet state makes its lifetime considerably longer (156 ms) than the n–π* triplet state of TX (a few ms). An increase of the triplet state lifetime constitutes a real asset to photoinitiation performances, as discussed earlier. However, no polymerization was observed in air due to quenching of the TX-ZnPc triplet state by oxygen.

A similar concept was presented by Versace et al., who reported the use of an anthraquinone-ZnPc (AQ-ZnPc) (Fig. 21B).10 Several two-component systems were compared for the FRP of TMPTA: AQ-ZnPc/Iod, AQ-ZnPc/MDEA, and AQ-ZnPc/TT. A comparison with unmodified AQ permitted to demonstrate the advantages of using Pc as a PS for initiation under visible light to be highlighted. Indeed, for all the described systems, high conversions of acrylate were obtained using a wide range of visible-light sources, from a xenon lamp to LEDs with wavelengths from 385 nm to 530 nm. AQ-ZnPc was able to initiate free-radical polymerization under visible LEDs (LED@455 nm, LED@470 nm and LED@530 nm), generally leading to conversions of around 20% in the presence of Iod, TT or MDEA co-initiators. In contrast, AQ was not able to initiate polymerization above 405 nm under the same conditions. This difference is due to the high absorption properties of AQ-ZnPc (ε405nm = 10000 M−1 cm−1, ε455nm = 2400 M−1 cm−1, ε470nm = 1600 M−1 cm−1) in comparison with those of AQ (ε405nm = 350 M−1 cm−1, ε455nm = 200 M−1 cm−1, ε470nm = 150 M−1 cm−1). Also, AQ-ZnPc/Iod could initiate the cationic polymerization of 3,4-epoxycyclohexylmethyl 3,4-epoxycyclohexanecarboxylate (EPOX) at low wavelength. If again no polymerization of acrylate was observed in air, the synthesis of an interpenetrated network from an EPOX/TMPTA mixture (50%/50% w/w) in the presence of AQZnPc/Iod was possible both in the laminate and in air, with high conversions enabled by the synergetic mechanism: indeed, it was demonstrated that an electron transfer reaction occurred between the ground state of Iod and the excited singlet states of AQ-ZnPc, as confirmed by the negative free energy, ΔGet (−1.05 eV), calculated from the Rehm–Weller equation170 (with the oxidation potential of AQ-ZnPc = 0.57 V (vs. SCE); the reduction potential of iodonium salt = −0.2 V (vs. SCE); and the excited singlet state energy of AQ-ZnPc = 1.82 eV).
Lalevée et al. investigated the use of two Pcs, namely, bis(octanoate)silicon phthalocyanine ((OCT)2-SiPc) (Fig. 22) and Mn-phthalocyanine (MnPc), as NIR photosensitizers for initiating the FRP of a mixture of methacrylate monomers (commercial Mix-MA) and compared their efficiencies with other dyes.107 A three-component system, combining (OCT)2-SiPc, an iodonium salt (Iod) and phosphine 4-(diphenylphosphine) benzoic acid (4-dppba), was used where 4-dppba acted as an oxygen inhibitor, allowing FRP in air. Due to its absorption properties, (OCT)2-SiPc could only initiate polymerization under LED@660 nm, while MnPc was effective under both 660 nm and 785 nm irradiation.

Xie et al. demonstrated that ZnPc could act as an electron donor for phosphotungstic acid, generating reactive species for the FRP of a mixture of poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA) and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG 400) (1:1 or 1:2).98 Polymerization was successfully achieved by irradiating the Q-band of ZnPc at 660 nm, in order to avoid toxicity associated with UV handling. Biocompatibility, swelling properties and the drug-retention ability of the obtained hybrid hydrogel were carefully evaluated. Consequently, an application in the biomedical field for in situ photopolymerization on lesions was considered, as detailed further. It is worth noting that, in this study, high conversions could also be obtained by using ZnPc alone as the PI, without the addition of phosphotungstic acid. However, the mechanism remained unknown.
Very recently, it was demonstrated that several Pcs could be used alone as PIs. Bowman et al. compared the potential of four Pc derivatives, zinc 2,9,16,23-tetra-tert-butyl-29H,31H-phthalocyanine (ZnTTP, λmax = 670 nm with εmax = 19000 M−1 cm−1), ZnPc (λmax = 660 nm with εmax = 17000 M−1 cm−1), Cu-TTP and metal free-TTP (λmax = 700 nm with εmax = 15000 M−1 cm−1), to initiate the FRP of di(ethylene glycol) ethyl ether acrylate under UV irradiation.99 Interestingly, pre-irradiation of the sample at 635 nm successfully reduced the inhibition period caused by dissolved oxygen (see section 5.1). ZnTTP, ZnPc and TTP were all able to initiate polymerization, in contrast to CuTTP. As seen above, the inefficiency of this last derivative could be related to the electron scavenger effect of Cu2+ ion having a d9 electron configuration. The proposed mechanism involves the formation of an endoperoxide on the macrocycle, resulting from the Diels–Alder reaction between the macrocycle (diene constituted of four pyrrole groups and four benzo groups) and singlet oxygen. This endoperoxide could undergo cleavage under UV light, forming two initiating RO˙ radicals. This hypothesis was supported by a computational approach.
Versace et al. also proposed the use of an Ag-complexed Pc, dmaph-Ag(II)Pc, as a one-component PI, which was able to initiate both cationic and radical polymerization.171 An octa-substituted metal-free Pc with (N,N-dimethylamino)phenyl groups on the peripheral positions of the macrocyclic ring was synthesized and complexed with the Ag2+ ion. Under irradiation at 385 nm (ε = 8300 M−1 cm−1) or 405 nm (ε = 5800 M−1 cm−1), a multi-step pathway leads to the formation of the initiating aminoalkyl radical species and H+, allowing FRP and CP, respectively. Polymerization conversions were improved by combining dmaph-Ag(II)Pc with a iodonium salt: indeed, the negative ΔGS1 value for the 1dmaph-Ag(II)Pc/Iod interaction (−0.34 eV) is consistent with a possible electron transfer reaction from the dmaph-Ag(II)Pc excited singlet state to Iod, according to the Rehm–Weller equation170 (oxidation potential of dmaph-Ag(II)Pc (vs. SCE) = 1.16 V; reduction potential of Iod (vs. SCE) = −0.2 V; and the energy of the singlet excited state of dmaph-Ag(II)Pc = 1.7 eV). Ag- complexation was detrimental to the absorption properties of the Pc, probably due to the heavy-atom effect. However, it did not impact on the photoinitiation properties, and permitted the generation of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) in situ, as described further (section 5.4).
The reactivity of Pcs is multifaceted, which explains why they are involved in various mechanism of photoinitiation. In the following section, we focus on the innovations associated with the use of Pcs as PIs, which is inspired by their impressive versatility.
5. Advantages of Pcs: chemical versatility
Pcs have found application in various fields: the textile industry, solar cells, sensors, cancer treatment.5–8 This is notably due to their incredible reactivity under light activation. Their high reactivity toward oxygen, their high absorption wavelengths, and chemical versatility have pushed chemists in the field of photopolymerization to give them a bigger role than just acting as PIs.
5.1. Opportunities for NIR applications
Research into new photoinitiators that are activable under NIR irradiation is currently a hot topic.12 It offers several advantages over UV- or visible-light mediated polymerization: the lower intensity of NIR light sources limits side reactions and photodegradation of components. However, despite the existence of dyes with adapted absorption, the development of NIR-mediated photopolymerization creates new challenges: classical photoinitiating systems generally fail to initiate polymerization. This could be attributed to involvement of high energy excited states, which are not reachable with low-energy NIR irradiation. However, some newly developed photoinitiating systems have managed to initiate polymerization under red light or NIR. The exceptional absorption of Pcs above 700 nm, with high extinction coefficients, makes them highly promising for this purpose.101,107 As described above, Lalevée et al. achieved polymerization under NIR irradiation by taking advantage of a particular photoinitiating system, combining classical PS and Iod with a phosphine derivative.107 Boyer et al. circumvented the classical route of photosensitization (reduction of the RAFT agent by the excited PS) to form radicals either from the solvent (NMP)100 or from an endoperoxide.101
Another asset of NIR irradiation is its deep penetration into the matter, offering new opportunities for applications. To demonstrate interest in the correlation between absorption wavelength and penetration depth, an interesting experiment was carried under sunlight exposure with the setup presented in Fig. 23.101 Several photoinitiating systems based on dyes (fac-[Ir(ppy)3], eosin Y (EY), AlPc, and AlNc) with narrow but complementary absorptions were superimposed in segregated transparent vessels, each containing a monomer and a RAFT agent. The distance between the lamp and dye depended on the absorption wavelength: the higher the absorption wavelength, the further from the lamp was the dye. By irradiating with a single broadband light source, covering the entire visible spectrum, polymerization succeeded simultaneously and independently in each layer. This idea of combining complementary dyes to optimize light harvesting, already investigated for solar cells, was applied to photochemical reactions for the first time in this study.

Finally, NIR light possesses a particular characteristic of interest for biomedical purposes. Its low intensity is appreciable for in situ applications, such as tissue engineering or dentistry, where UV light is contraindicated due to cytotoxicity. Also, the high penetration depth of NIR has great potential to develop under-skin systems. Corrigan et al. demonstrated that RAFT photopolymerization using AlPc NIR PS could occur even through opaque and thick barriers (up to 15 mm), such as a sheet of paper, but also chicken or pig skin, with an insignificant impact on polymerization, and with light sources up to 850 nm.100 This opens huge opportunities in the field of tissue engineering.
5.2. Possibility to prevent oxygen inhibition in radical polymerization
One of the main issues of current radical photopolymerization processes is the inhibition of propagating radicals by oxygen. Indeed, the interaction of oxygen with radicals is generally faster than initiation or propagation processes.99 When oxygen cannot be removed from the medium, an alternative is needed. A common strategy is to use a PS such as Pcs to eliminate oxygen before polymerization.
Previously, the high reactivity of Pcs toward oxygen was investigated in detail. In the process of photosensitization, it is thought that MPc is first transformed into the triplet state and its energy is transferred to ground state oxygen, O2 (3∑g). With this energy transfer, excited state oxygen, O2 (1Δg), is produced, which then oxidizes the substrate. This approach, known as the Type II mechanism, is illustrated in Scheme 1.110,127,140,172
 Scheme 1  Type II mechanism (MPc = metallated phthalocyanine, ISC = intersystem crossing, Subs = substrate, 3O2 = O2 (3∑g), 1O2 = O2 (1Δg)).110,127,140,172 
Triplet state oxygen (3O2) interacts with the excited triplet state sensitizer (3MPc*) and singlet oxygen is generated. Thus, if singlet oxygen quantum yields (ΦΔ) are efficient for quenching 3MPc* with ground state oxygen, this is comparable to the MPc triplet state quantum yield.174 According to the Type I mechanism illustrated in Scheme 2, the excited triplet state sensitizer (3MPc*) can also interact with molecular oxygen in the ground state or substrate molecules (eqn (4) and (5)) to generate superoxide (eqn (4) and (6)) and hydroperoxyl radicals (eqn (7)) and afterwards oxidize the substrate with these radicals (eqn (8) and (9)).110,172,173
 Scheme 2  Type I mechanism (MPc = metallated phthalocyanine, Subs = substrate).110,172,173 
Excited oxygen (1O2 or ROS) is no longer a threat to propagating radicals, in contrast to ground state 3O2. As seen before, they are reactive toward the macrocycle, resulting in photobleaching. However, they are also reactive toward a wide range of organic molecules (ascorbic acid,175 thioether,176 sulfoxide177). These side reactions with surrounding molecules may limit photobleaching by trapping excited oxygen. The interaction between Pc and oxygen induces an inhibition time, but afterwards, radical polymerization can occur without quenching of propagating species.
This strategy was first developed for promoting bulk free-radical photopolymerization.178,179 If anthracene was added to scavenge 1O2 generated previously,178 Bowman et al. proved that no scavenger was required: PS alone could lead to 3O2 elimination.179 The inhibition effect of anthracene moieties was first reported by Yagci and co-workers in conventional systems by using thioxanthone–anthracene as the photoinitiator.180,181
In the Pc systems, Zn(tpp) was introduced only as an oxygen inhibitor and was not involved in the initiation process. When such a strategy is desired for oxygen removal, it is worth considering the parameters that influence 1O2 quantum yield. Notably, the choice of the metal ion seems to be important. Indeed, no suppression of oxygen inhibition was obtained in the presence of CuPc, NiPc, FePc or MnPc, probably due to incomplete filling of d orbitals.179
Bowman et al. proposed combining the initiation and oxygen elimination properties of Pcs, by activating the system twice.99 Their proposed mechanism is outlined in Fig. 24. First, the Pcs were pre-irradiated at 635 nm (on the Q-band), allowing the elimination of 3O2 while avoiding the formation of propagating radicals. Then, initiation was triggered by irradiation at 365 nm (B-band). A correlation was established between the pre-irradiation time and reduction of the induction time. In this study, the photosensitization of oxygen plays a particular role, as the formation of an endoperoxide through the reaction between the macrocycle and singlet oxygen is the origin of initiation. Consequently, the 1O2 quantum yields permitted the higher reactivity of ZnTTP and ZnPc compared with that of TTP to be anticipated.

This method of oxygen elimination is also applicable to RAFT polymerization in solution. Boyer et al. reported that AlPc anions could reduce oxygen, avoiding the deoxidation state, despite a period of inhibition.100
5.3. Dual role: application in photodynamic therapy
As discussed earlier, from its triplet excited state, Pc can transfer its energy to surrounding oxygen, resulting in the formation of singlet oxygen or reactive oxygen species (ROS). 1O2 and ROS are well-known in biology to induce cytolysis, as they can react with cell components and hinder vital functions. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is based on the photosensitization of oxygen to kill target cells, such as tumor cells or bacteria. Notably, Pcs are frequently chosen as PSs182,183 because of their high singlet oxygen quantum yields and absorptions in the NIR, which is particularly suited to some biomedical applications as they can penetrate into deep tissues.184 As they are subject to aggregation, they are often embedded in drug delivery systems, such as nanoparticles or hydrogels, for PDT applications.184 In the following two examples, Pcs have dual roles as PSs for photopolymerization initiation and for PDT, in an elegant way to directly incorporate the PS into the polymer matrix.
Xie et al. proposed to use the dual properties of Pcs as photoinitiators and photosensitizers for antitumoral activity.98 In the presented work, the PEG hydrogel containing ZnPc and PTA was generated within a few minutes under NIR light. Once formed, the hydrogel proved to be biocompatible, with good swelling and drug retention properties. The hydrogel could also be formed in situ on tumor cells (Fig. 25). During polymerization, ZnPc produces singlet oxygen at the interface with cells, which kill them. The incorporation of a PS into such a hydrogel prevents its diffusion, keeping its concentration high only at the target location, which enhances the PDT process and limits side effects. It is noteworthy that the decrease in singlet oxygen production by the hydrogel compared with that of ZnPc in solution is quite minor. Also, interactions between PEG chains and the cell surface are expected to weaken thus facilitating the entrance of the PS into the cell. The dual roles of ZnPc in this work seem to be a promising strategy in cancer PDT.

When the photobleaching of Pcs during polymerization is low, a high concentration of Pcs remains intact in the polymer film. At the surface, they can still react under light and act as a PS. Thus, Versace et al. proposed the synthesis of an antibacterial polymer coating from AQ-ZnPc/Iod/EPOX/TMPTA.10 High conversions of monomers permitted Pc derivatives to be entrapped in the polymer film. These films were then placed in contact with bacteria (S. aureus), and half of the films were irradiated under visible light, while the other half remained in the dark. The development of bacteria on irradiated films was lower than for the non-irradiated ones, showing the effect of 1O2 production at the surface (Fig. 26). This kind of coating, easily disinfected under visible light irradiation, could be relevant to protect surfaces in hospital facilities or of biomedical instruments.

5.4. Dual role: application in nanocomposites
The one-pot photoinduced synthesis of nanocomposites has become a common strategy nowadays, thanks to its easy implementation. Indeed, by dissolving a metal salt in a monomer formulation in the presence of certain photoinitiating systems, reduction of the salt can occur concomitantly with photopolymerization, leading to the formation of a hybrid nanocomposite. This technique is well developed for generating silver NPs from silver salts, generally AgNO3 or AgSbF6, in epoxy,185,186 acrylamide,187 acrylate188–190 or IPN191 matrices. Interestingly, the metal ion could be taken from a MPc photoinitiator instead of an additional metal salt.
Indeed, the impressive reduction properties of Pc rings seem to be well adapted to the reduction of metal salts. Versace et al. demonstrated that it was possible to generate AgNPs from the irradiation of an Ag-complexed Pc (dmaph-Ag(II)Pc).171 Dmaph-Ag(II)Pc also acted as a photoinitiator for both radical and cationic photopolymerization, allowing the one-step synthesis of nanocomposites. By comparing it to a metal-free Pc, the photoinitiating properties of dmaph-Ag(II)Pc proved to come essentially from the reactivity of the Pc ring. Consequently, there was no competition effect between the photopolymerization process and the generation of NPs. Again, the metal-complexed Pc played dual roles: as a visible-light photosensitizer and as the Ag-NP precursor. This opens opportunities in the generation of hybrid nanocomposite materials (Fig. 27).

6. Conclusions
Pc research is a very special topic in chemistry and materials science, on which scientists have intensively been working for many years. What makes it special is that the designed and synthesized compounds are extensively used in various fields, such as photodynamic therapy agents in cancer treatment, chemical sensors, solar cells, nonlinear optics, and recently as photoinitiators for free-radical, cationic and controlled radical polymerization. The variety of applications is due to some features of its structure, such as high thermal, chemical, and optical stability, as well as unique electrochemical, photochemical and photophysical properties, which can be finely tuned by means of modification of the Pc macro ring, changes to the nature of coordinated metal atoms or the addition of an axial ligand to the central metal atom. In recent years, Pcs have also been utilized as excellent photoinitiator compounds that can be used for polymerization. In the present review, we reported an overview of the design, synthesis and use of Pcs for photopolymerization applications, which have been the subject of intensive research in the polymer field. In the first section, modifications of and syntheses approaches to symmetrically organized phthalocyanines, unsymmetrically organized phthalocyanines, and their multinuclear systems with diverse central metal atoms and different substituents attached to the phthalocyanine macrocycle are covered. Secondly, some important photochemical and photophysical parameters of various Pc examples reported in the literature are provided to understand the relationship between Pc structures and photosensitization or photoinitiation efficiency. Then, the solubility of Pcs, strongly based on aggregation, and the redox properties of Pcs, which can be controlled by the kinds of metals or substituents, are discussed with a view to perform photoinitiation for polymerization. The uses of Pc photosensitizers for reversible addition–fragmentation chain-transfer (RAFT) polymerization, free-radical and cationic photopolymerization (FRP and CP) in the bulk are also presented in detail. Depending on the structure and metal, these photoinitiators can act over a broad wavelength range of the electromagnetic spectrum from UV to NIR. Finally, some advantages of Pcs for overcoming oxygen inhibition in radical polymerization, NIR applications, and multiple roles in the applications of PDT and nanocomposites are presented. We strongly believe that this review will not only attract attention from researchers working on phthalocyanine chemistry but will also make a significant contribution to researchers working in the fields of photopolymerization and materials science to develop effective Pc-based photoinitiators with strong absorption and emission in the NIR region for polymerization.
