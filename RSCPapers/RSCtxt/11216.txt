The investigation of photophysical and physicochemical properties revealed that these copolymers featured low optical band gaps (1.56–1.73 eV) and low-lying HOMO energy levels (−5.40 to −5.02 eV). Bulk heterojunction OPV devices based on these copolymers and [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester as active layers showed moderate power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of between 1.36 and 2.68% under air mass 1.5 simulated solar illumination. Space-charge-limited current measurements and atomic force microscopy measurements of the blend films revealed that both charge-transporting characteristics and film morphologies have significant influences on the photovoltaic performances. OPV devices based on the copolymers with [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester showed a PCE of up to 5.17% with a short circuit current of 10.1 mA cm−2, an open circuit voltage of 0.80 V and a fill factor of 0.64.
Introduction
Organic photovoltaics (OPVs) have become one of the main research topics in organic electronics because of their advantages of low cost, light weight, and large-area manufacturability.1,2 One of the major breakthroughs for high performance OPVs is based on the concept of bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) structure in the organic active layer, which comprises a blend of a π-conjugated polymer as an electron donor (p-type) and a fullerene derivative as an electron acceptor (n-type).3 Poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) has been investigated as a typical donor material for BHJ-type OPVs. However, P3HT has a relatively large band gap and a high-lying energy level of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO), which restricts the increase of the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) for P3HT-based OPVs.4 Therefore, the synthesis of polymers with low band gaps and low-lying HOMOs has become a general approach to develop new p-type OPV materials. To satisfy this requirement, great efforts have been focused on the synthesis of π-conjugated polymers based on the structure of alternate electron-rich (donor) and electron-deficient (acceptor) units.5 In this context, a variety of π-conjugated compounds such as 2,7-carbazole,6 benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene,7–9 dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]silole (DTS),10,11 dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]germole,12 thieno[3,2-b]thiophene,13 and 5H-dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyran14 have been utilized as donor units in donor–acceptor (D–A) copolymers. On the other hand, the development of new acceptor units is still of significance for constructing D–A copolymers since effective acceptor units are limited to 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole,7,9,10,14–16 diketopyrrolopyrrole,17 thieno[3,4-c]pyrole-4,6-dione,8,11,12,18 and thieno[3,4-b]thiophene having electron-withdrawing substituents.9
We have developed a series of new electron-deficient thiophene units that have an annelated ring with electron-withdrawing functional groups, to increase the electronegative character of thiophene based π-conjugated systems with maintaining effective conjugation, and these π-conjugated systems have been applied successfully as electron-transporting materials for organic field-effect transistors (OFETs).19 Subsequently, we recently revealed that the D–A copolymers having dihexyl-substituted naphtho[2,3-c]thiophene-4,9-dione20 as an acceptor unit, in a combination with [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM), exhibited good OPV characteristics with a PCE of up to 4.87%.21 Furthermore, in order to apply the difluorodioxocyclopenta[c]thiophene (C) unit (Fig. 1)22 in OPV donor polymers as the acceptor unit,23 we developed new D–A copolymers (DTS-C and DTS-T-C) by combining the C unit with DTS (Fig. 2).24 However, the molecular weight of copolymerized DTS-C was insufficiently low compared to that of DTS-T-C, due to the insufficiency of solubilizing alkyl groups in its conjugated backbone. Furthermore, the strong electron-withdrawing nature of the C unit led to a large decrease in the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of the copolymers, which, on applying to BHJ cells, prevented efficient charge separation between the copolymers and PC71BM, resulting in the poor OPV performances. These results inspired us not only to introduce solubilizing groups but also to concomitantly increase the LUMO energy level by the chemical modifications of the fluorine atoms in the C unit. On the basis of this concept, we designed dihexyldioxocyclopenta[c]thiophene (Ch) and (dihexylmethylidene)dioxocyclopenta[c]thiophene (Chy): one with a tetrahedral carbon atom having two hexyl groups instead of the CF2 group, and the other with a planar structure having a dihexylmethylidene group (Fig. 2). We first calculated the molecular orbitals of model compounds by density functional theory (DFT) at the B3LYP/6-31G (d, p) level. The alkyl groups of Ch and Chy were replaced with methyl groups (referred to as Cm and Cmy) to ease the calculations (Fig. 1). The participation of antibonding σ* C–F orbitals lowered the LUMO energy level for the C unit. Compared to that of the C unit, the LUMO energy levels of the Cm and Cmy units increase by 0.79 and 0.49 eV, respectively, indicating that the electron-accepting capability of Cm and Cmy is slightly weaker than that of C. The calculated result also indicates that this replacement leads to the increase of the HOMO energy level. Therefore, Ch- and Chy-based copolymers are expected to increase both the HOMO and LUMO energy levels. To investigate the effectiveness of Ch and Chy as acceptor units in OPV donor polymers, we designed new D–A copolymers (DTS-Ch and DTS-Chy), which are based on the combination of the DTS donor unit and the acceptor units (Ch and Chy). Furthermore, to extend the conjugation of the donor parts in polymer backbones, D–A copolymers with a thiophene π bridge25 between the donor and acceptor units have also been designed (DTS-T-Ch and DTS-T-Chy) (Fig. 2). Note that, thanks to the solubilizing alkyl groups of the Ch and Chy units, we can adopt pristine thiophene as the π-bridge instead of 3-dodecylthiophene in DTS-T-C, which might induce better π–π interactions in BHJ active layers. In this article, we present the synthesis, properties, and OPV performances of these copolymers.

Results and discussion
Synthesis and thermal property
Syntheses of DTS-Ch, DTS-T-Ch, DTS-Chy, and DTS-T-Chy are outlined in Scheme 1. According to our reported alkylation reaction of thiophene-fused 1,3-diketone,26 dihexyl-substituted dioxocyclopenta[c]thiophene 2 was obtained by the reaction of 1 with 1-iodohexane. Dihexylmethylidene-substituted dioxocyclopenta[c]thiophene 3 was prepared by the acid-mediated condensation reaction of 1 with 7-tridecanone.27 Compound 5 was synthesized by a palladium-catalyzed Stille coupling reaction between 2,5-dibromodithienosilole and 2-tributylstannylthiophene, followed by stannylation to yield compound 6. Finally, the dibromo compounds (2 or 3) and distannyl compounds (6 or 7) were copolymerized by a Stille coupling reaction in the presence of Pd2(dba)3·CHCl3 and P(o-tolyl)3 in toluene at 120 °C for 48 hours to give DTS-Ch, DTS-T-Ch, DTS-Chy, and DTS-T-Chy (Scheme 1), which were purified by sequential Soxhlet washing with methanol and hexane to remove low-molecular-weight compounds, and finally extracting with chloroform. The synthesized copolymers exhibited good solubility in common organic solvents such as chloroform, chlorobenzene, and o-dichlorobenzene. Analytical gel-permeation chromatography (GPC) of DTS-T-Ch and DTS-T-Chy with chloroform as an eluent at room temperature showed broad molecular-mass distributions, which was attributed to the aggregation of polymers. Thus, the number-average molecular weights (Mn) of copolymers DTS-Ch, DTS-T-Ch, DTS-Chy, and DTS-T-Chy were measured using high temperature GPC with o-dichlorobenzene as an eluent at 140 °C to be 8.3, 11.7, 6.3, and 7.9 kg mol−1 with molar-mass dispersities of 1.6, 2.0, 1.7, and 2.5, respectively. In spite of the introduction of alkyl groups at all units, the Mns of DTS-Ch and DTS-Chy were lower than those of DTS-T-Ch and DTS-T-Chy, respectively, which might be attributed to the relatively low chemical stability of distannyl compound 7. Owing to the contribution of the dialkylated tetrahedral structure for increasing the solubility, the Mns of Ch-based copolymers were higher than those of Chy-based copolymers.

As shown in Fig. 3, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) under a nitrogen flow showed that all the copolymers possess high thermal stabilities with a 5% weight loss at temperatures (Td) of over 300 °C. Especially, DTS-Ch and DTS-T-Ch bearing the Ch unit showed excellent thermal stability with their Tds of 421 and 430 °C, respectively. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis of all the copolymers did not show any noticeable thermal transition up to 300 °C (Fig. S1, see the ESI†).

Photophysical properties
The UV-vis absorption spectra of DTS-Ch, DTS-Chy, DTS-T-Ch, and DTS-T-Chy in chloroform solution and in film on a quartz plate are shown in Fig. 4. The corresponding spectroscopic data are summarized in Table 1. All the copolymers showed two absorption bands, which is a typical feature of D–A type configuration. The weak absorption band at shorter wavelength corresponds to the local π–π* transition of the polymer backbone, while the strong main band at longer wavelength is attributed to the intramolecular charge-transfer (CT) transition between the donor and acceptor units. The blue shift of absorption maxima for DTS-T-Ch and DTS-T-Chy in solution compared with those of DTS-Ch and DTS-Chy indicates that the presence of thiophene between the donor and acceptor units contributes to decreasing the donor–acceptor characteristics. The shoulder at around 750 nm observed for DTS-T-Chy might imply the appearance of interchain π–π interactions even under dilute solution conditions. The CT bands of DTS-Chy and DTS-T-Chy in a film were red-shifted compared to those obtained in a solution, while the absorption spectra of DTS-Ch and DTS-T-Ch in a film showed no noticeable difference from their solution spectra. This result indicates that the coplanar conformation of dihexylmethylidene groups relative to the polymer backbone in DTS-Chy and DTS-T-Chy might facilitate cofacial interchain aggregations. The absorption coefficient (α) in film was increased by the introduction of the thiophene linker, and thus, DTS-T-Ch showed the highest absorption coefficient among the copolymers, which implies its better light-harvesting ability (Fig. S2(a)†). From the onset of absorption in film, the optical HOMO–LUMO energy gaps (ΔEoptg) of DTS-Ch, DTS-T-Ch, DTS-Chy, and DTS-T-Chy were estimated to be 1.68, 1.73, 1.57, and 1.56 eV, respectively.

Physicochemical properties
To determine the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of these copolymers, we used both cyclic voltammetry (CV) and photoelectron spectroscopy. As shown in Fig. S3,† CV measurements of these copolymers in films on a platinum plate showed both oxidation and reduction waves, which reflects the presence of both electron-donating and electron-accepting units in the conjugated backbone. The electrochemical data are listed in Table 1. Under the assumption that the energy level of Fc/Fc+ is −4.8 eV below the vacuum level,28 the HOMO energy levels (ECVHOMO) and LUMO energy levels (ECVLUMO) of these copolymers were estimated and are also listed in Table 1. The electrochemically estimated HOMO–LUMO energy gaps (ΔECVg) of DTS-Chy and DTS-T-Chy are smaller than those of DTS-Ch and DTS-T-Ch, similar to the trend of the ΔEoptg values, indicating that the electron-accepting nature of the Chy unit is relatively higher than that of the Ch unit. It should be mentioned that ECVHOMO and ECVLUMO of these copolymers are higher than those of corresponding DTS-C (ECVHOMO: −5.51 eV, ECVLUMO: −3.96 eV) and DTS-T-C (ECVHOMO: −5.38 eV, ECVLUMO: −3.73 eV) under the same measurement conditions, which can be rationalized by the relatively weaker electron-accepting capability of the Ch and Chy units compared to the C unit. These indicated that the relative electron-accepting capabilities of the C, Ch, and Chy units are consistent with the theoretical calculations (Fig. 1). Ionization potentials (HOMO levels) of the copolymers in the solid state were evaluated by photoelectron spectroscopy in air (Fig. 5(a)).
 Fig. 5  (a) Photoelectron spectra of copolymer films. (b) The energy level diagrams for ITO, PEDOT:PSS, copolymers, PC61BM, Ca, and Al. The HOMO energy levels are determined by photo-electron spectroscopy in air. The LUMO energy levels are determined from HOMO and ΔEoptg. 
From the onset of the spectra, the HOMO energy levels (EHOMO) of DTS-Ch, DTS-T-Ch, DTS-Chy, and DTS-T-Chy were determined to be −5.40, −5.16, −5.27, and −5.02 eV, respectively. From these values and the ΔEoptg values, the LUMO energy levels (ELUMO) of DTS-Ch, DTS-T-Ch, DTS-Chy, and DTS-T-Chy were calculated to be −3.72, −3.43, −3.70, and −3.46 eV, respectively. These EHOMO and ELUMO values are in qualitative agreement with the corresponding ECVHOMO and ECVLUMO values. Based on the EHOMO and ELUMO for the copolymers, an energy level diagram is summarized together with typical OPV materials in Fig. 5(b). The low-lying HOMO energy levels of DTS-Ch and DTS-Chy compared with those of DTS-T-Ch and DTS-T-Chy indicate that the absence of thiophene between the donor and acceptor units contributes to increasing the electron-accepting characteristics of the conjugated backbones. Since the open circuit voltage (Voc) of OPVs has known to be proportional to the difference between the HOMO energy level of the donor and the LUMO energy level of the acceptor,29DTS-Ch and DTS-Chy are expected to show higher Voc than DTS-T-Ch and DTS-T-Chy. Furthermore, LUMO energy levels of those copolymers are higher than that of PC61BM by 0.08–0.37 eV, especially the differences between the LUMO levels of the copolymers (DTS-T-Ch and DTS-T-Chy) and PC61BM are above 0.3 eV, indicating the capability of effective charger-separation in their BHJ active layers.30
Photovoltaic performances
In order to investigate the OPV performances of the copolymers, the BHJ solar cells were fabricated with a typical layered configuration of glass/indium tin oxide (ITO)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate)(PEDOT:PSS)/active layers/Ca/Al. The active layers comprised the copolymer/PC61BM blend films. Their fabrication conditions including blend composition, processing solvent, film thickness, and post-thermal-annealing temperature were systematically investigated and optimized: thus, the active layers were fabricated by spin-coating under a nitrogen atmosphere from a chlorobenzene solution of copolymer/PC61BM blend in 1:2 or 1:1.5 weight ratio without thermal annealing, and film thicknesses were controlled to be 70–90 nm. Note that post-thermal-annealing did not show substantial improvement of OPV performances for all the devices. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the OPV devices were measured under the air mass 1.5 global (AM 1.5G) simulated solar illumination with an irradiation intensity of 100 mW cm−2, and the obtained electrical photovoltaic parameters of PCE, Voc, a short-circuit current (Jsc), and a fill factor (FF) are summarized in Table 2. As shown in Fig. 6(a), all the devices composed of the copolymer and PC61BM showed OPV characteristics. The OPV device based on DTS-Ch showed a markedly high Voc of 0.95 V, which is among the highest class in PC61BM-based polymer solar cells.31 This result can be explained by the relatively low-lying HOMO energy level of DTS-Ch. On the other hand, the OPV device based on DTS-T-Chy showed lower Voc (0.69 V) than those of other devices, due to its relatively high-lying HOMO energy level. Consequently, the observed Voc values are in qualitative agreement with the HOMO energy levels shown in Fig. 5.29 The devices based on DTS-T-Ch and DTS-T-Chy showed higher Jsc and FF than did the devices based on DTS-Ch and DTS-Chy. This phenomenon will be discussed in detail later. Overall, the DTS-T-Ch- and DTS-T-Chy-based devices exhibited moderate PCEs of 2.68% and 2.31%, respectively, while the DTS-Ch- and DTS-Chy-based devices exhibited lower PCEs of 1.44% and 1.36%, respectively. To evaluate the photoresponses of the devices, external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) were measured over a range of different wavelengths. As shown in Fig. 6(b), all the devices exhibited a broad photoresponse between 300 and 800 nm. Considering the absorption spectra of copolymers and blend films shown in Fig. 4 and S2(b),† the photocurrent in a short wavelength region of 300–400 nm and a long wavelength region of 500–800 nm can be attributed mainly to the absorption of PC61BM and the copolymers, respectively.

To gain insight into the observed difference of Jsc, the space-charge-limited currents (SCLCs) of the blend films were measured to compare the carrier mobilities of the blend films with one another.32 Hole-only devices with a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/blend film/Au and electron-only devices with a structure of ITO/TiOx/blend film/Ca/Al were fabricated, where the blend films were fabricated under the above-mentioned optimized conditions. Carrier mobility (μ) was calculated from the equation of μ = 8d3[J/(V − Vbi)2]/(9εε0), where d, ε, ε0, and Vbi are the blend-film thickness, the dielectric constant of the copolymer, the permittivity of free space, and the built-in voltage, respectively. The J–V characteristics of these devices are shown in Fig. S4,† and the SCLC hole (μSCLCh) and electron (μSCLCe) mobilities are summarized in Table 3. The observed μSCLCh values are increased in the order of DTS-Chy < DTS-Ch < DTS-T-Ch < DTS-T-Chy, interestingly, which is in good agreement with the trend of Jsc in the OPV devices. The hole-transporting characteristics of the unblended copolymers evaluated by OFETs revealed that the hole mobilities of the copolymers with the thiophene linker (DTS-T-Ch and DTS-T-Chy) are higher than those of the copolymers (DTS-Ch and DTS-Chy) without the thiophene linker, and the highest hole mobility of 4.6 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 was obtained for DTS-T-Chy (Table S1 and Fig. S4†). This result is consistent with the trend of the SCLC hole mobilities of the blend films. On the other hand, SCLC electron mobility (μSCLCe) was observed only for the DTS-T-Ch- and DTS-T-Chy-based devices. Therefore, the hole-transporting characteristics of the copolymers as well as the ambipolar characters of their blend films contribute to the Jsc of their OPV cells.

It has been known that the nanometer-scale morphology of blend films also plays an important role in OPV device performances.33 Thus, the surface morphology of the blend films was investigated by atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements. As shown in Fig. S6,† all the blend films exhibited nanometer-scale aggregated domains, whose average roughness (Ra) was found to be 0.23 for DTS-Ch, 1.83 for DTS-T-Ch, 0.55 for DTS-Chy, and 1.51 nm for DTS-T-Chy. This result indicates that the DTS-T-Ch- and DTS-T-Chy-based blend films formed larger domains than the DTS-Ch- and DTS-Chy-based blend films. In other words, the introduction of pristine thiophene as the π-bridge induces nanometer-scale aggregated domains in blend films. Thus, morphologies of DTS-T-Ch/PC61BM and DTS-T-Chy/PC61BM were beneficial for efficient charge separation as well as the formation of both hole-transporting and electron-transporting pathways, which contributes to the higher Jsc of their OPV cells than those of the cells based on DTS-Ch and DTS-Chy without the thiophene linker.
To further improve the performance of OPV cells based on DTS-T-Ch and DTS-T-Chy, active layers were fabricated from a blend of these copolymers with PC71BM. As shown in Fig. 6(c) and (d) and summarized in Table 3, DTS-T-Ch/PC71BM and DTS-T-Chy/PC71BM devices showed improved PCEs of 2.84 and 3.43%, respectively, compared with the corresponding PC61BM-based devices to some extent. Furthermore, although the addition of 3% 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO)34 for the DTS-T-Chy-based device did not much improve the OPV performance, for the DTS-T-Ch-based device, the addition of 3% DIO in o-dichlorobenzene led to a drastic increase of Jsc (10.1 mA cm−2) and FF (0.64) with maintaining the Voc at a high level (0.80 V), resulting in a substantial improvement of the overall device performance to 5.17% of PCE. The EQE spectrum of this device showed good photoresponse with a maximum value of 50% at 450 nm. As shown in Fig. S7,† the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of DTS-T-Ch/PC71BM films showed a broad peak around 20° due to π–π stacking between the backbones of the copolymers, irrespective of processing with DIO. On the other hand, the AFM images shown in Fig. 7 clearly indicate that the addition of DIO to the DTS-T-Ch-containing blend greatly increased the domain size with a Ra value of 2.25 nm (Fig. 7(b)), improved from the value of 1.90 nm for the blend film without DIO (Fig. 7(a)).

Conclusion
In summary, we have designed, synthesized, and characterized new low band-gap D–A copolymers based on dioxocyclopentene-annelated thiophenes as electron-accepting units. The copolymers were synthesized through the Stille coupling polymerization between brominated acceptor units and distannylated donor units. The results of photophysical and physicochemical measurements revealed that these copolymers featured low optical band-gaps (1.56–1.73 eV) and low-lying HOMO energy levels (−5.40 to −5.02 eV). In comparison with DTS-Ch and DTS-Chy, thiophene-linked copolymers DTS-T-Ch and DTS-T-Chy showed appropriate LUMO energy levels, stronger absorption ability, and higher hole mobilities as well as ambipolar characters of blend films with PC61BM to lead to higher PCEs in their OPVs. Furthermore, the OPV devices based on DTS-T-Ch/PC71BM (1:1.5 w/w) reached an increased PCE of up to 5.17% with a Voc of 0.80 V, a Jsc of 10.1 mA cm−2, and a FF of 0.64. This work clearly demonstrates that dioxocyclopentene-annelated thiophene can be a promising electron-accepting unit for donor–acceptor conjugated copolymers. We expect that the OPV performances can be further improved by the precise optimization of both molecular design and device structures.
Experimental section
General information
Column chromatography was performed on silica gel (KANTO Chemical silica gel 60N, 40–50 μm) or neutral alumina (Merck Aluminum oxide 90 standardized). Thin-layer chromatography (TLC) plates were visualized with UV. Preparative gel permeation chromatography (GPC) was performed on a Japan Analytical Industry LC-908 equipped with a JAI-GEL 1H/2H. 1H NMR spectra were recorded on a JEOL JMM-ECS400 in CDCl3 with tetramethylsilane as an internal standard. Data are reported as follows: chemical shift in ppm (δ), multiplicity (s = singlet, t = triplet, m = multiplet, br = broad), coupling constant (Hz), and integration. Mass spectra were obtained on a Shimadzu GCMS-QP-5050 or a Shimadzu AXIMA-TOF. DSC and TGA were performed under nitrogen at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 with a Shimadzu DSC-60 and a Shimadzu TGA-50, respectively. UV-visible spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu UV-3100PC. All spectra were obtained in spectrograde solvents. CV was carried out on a BAS CV-620C voltammetric analyzer. CV measurements were carried out at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1 in acetonitrile containing 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6) as the supporting electrolyte by using a platinum plate coated with the film as the working electrode, platinum wire as the counter electrode, and Ag/AgNO3 as the reference electrode. Photoelectron spectroscopy was carried out using a Riken Keiki Co. Ltd. AC-3. The measurements were performed under a N2 atmosphere. The irradiation light power was set to be 10 nW cm−2. X-ray diffraction patterns were obtained using Bragg–Brentano geometry with CuKα radiation as an X-ray source with an acceleration voltage of 45 kV and a beam current of 200 mA. The scanning mode was set to 2θ scans between 3° and 30° with scanning steps of 0.01°. Elemental analyses were performed on a PerkinElmer LS-50B by the Elemental Analysis Section of Comprehensive Analysis Center (CAC) of The Institute of Scientific and Industrial Research (ISIR), Osaka University. The surface structure of the deposited organic film was observed by atomic force microscopy (Shimadzu, SPM9600).

Fabrication and characterization of the photovoltaic device
Organic photovoltaic devices were fabricated with ITO glass as a positive electrode, Ca/Al as a negative electrode, and the blend film of the copolymer/PC61BM or PC71BM as an active layer which was sandwiched between the electrodes. The active area was defined to be 0.09 cm2 for all the devices. The ITO glass was first cleaned by ultrasonication in toluene, acetone, H2O, and 2-propanol for 10 min, respectively, followed by O2 plasma treatment for 10 min. The ITO glass was then activated by ozone treatment for 1 h. The PEDOT:PSS layer was spin-coated on the ITO surface at 3000 rpm for 1 min and dried at 135 °C for 10 min and the thickness is about 30 nm. The active layer was then prepared by spin-coating on the ITO/PEDOT:PSS electrode at 800–1200 rpm for 2 min in a glove box. The typical thickness of the active layer was 70–90 nm, measured on a KLA Tencor Alpha-step IQ. Ca/Al electrodes were deposited on the top of the active layer through a shadow mask under a vacuum of 10−5 to 10−4 Pa to a thickness of 100 nm determined using a quartz crystal monitor. The photovoltaic characteristics were measured in N2 under simulated AM 1.5G solar irradiation (100 mW cm−2) (SAN-EI ELECTRIC, XES-301S). The current–voltage (J–V) measurements of the devices were conducted using a KEITHLEY 2400 semiconductor parameter analyzer. The EQE spectra were measured using a Soma Optics Ltd. S-9240.
SCLC measurements
The fabrication and characterization methods are the same as those used for photovoltaic devices. Hole-only and electron-only devices were prepared with a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/Au and ITO/TiOx/blend film/Ca/Al, respectively. The TiOx layer was formed based on the sol–gel process of Ti(OiPr)4, which was spin-coated on the ITO surface at 3000 rpm for 1 min and dried at room temperature in air for 2 h. Carrier mobility (μ) was calculated from the equation of μ = 8d3[J/(V − Vbi)2]/(9εε0), and the values of ε = 3 and ε0 = 8.8 × 10−12 were used. The Vbi is estimated from the difference of work function between two electrodes.
