    , Accepted 10th January 2017First published on 10th January 2017AbstractPerovskites have been demonstrated in solar cells with a power conversion efficiency of well above 20%, which makes them one of the strongest contenders for next generation photovoltaics. While there are no concerns about their efficiency, very little is known about their stability under illumination and load. Ionic defects and their migration in the perovskite crystal lattice are some of the most alarming sources of degradation, which can potentially prevent the commercialization of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). In this work, we provide direct evidence of electric field-induced ionic defect migration and we isolate their effect on the long-term performance of state-of-the-art devices. Supported by modelling, we demonstrate that ionic defects, migrating on timescales significantly longer (above 103 s) than what has so far been explored (from 10−1 to 102 s), abate the initial efficiency by 10–15% after several hours of operation at the maximum power point. Though these losses are not negligible, we prove that the initial efficiency is fully recovered when leaving the device in the dark for a comparable amount of time. We verified this behaviour over several cycles resembling day/night phases, thus probing the stability of PSCs under native working conditions. This unusual behaviour reveals that research and industrial standards currently in use to assess the performance and the stability of solar cells need to be adjusted for PSCs. Our work paves the way for much needed new testing protocols and figures of merit specifically designed for PSCs.

Broader context
Perovskite solar cells have been recently demonstrated as a potential new photovoltaic technology. Better than any previous photovoltaic material, perovskite combines the advantage of low processing and high power conversion efficiency. Furthermore, perovskite solar cells can be used in tandem with market dominating silicon solar cells to increase their efficiency and thus to lower the price of solar energy. While there are no concerns about their efficiency, very little is known about the stability of perovskite solar cells under illumination and load, i.e. under real working conditions. So far, discussion about stability has been mainly focused on external factors, such as oxygen, water and UV light exposure, which are well-known causes of rapid performance degradation. However, performance losses occur even ruling out any external source of degradation. This work provides a step improvement in our knowledge of this phenomenon and it paves the way towards stable perovskite solar cells.

Introduction
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have the potential to become a new generation of photovoltaics with the shortest energy payback time and the lowest CO2 emission factor among the existing technologies.1 In only a few years, unprecedented progress in preparation procedures and material compositions has delivered lab-scale devices that have now reached power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of up to 22.1%.2 However, this impressive improvement of the PCE has not been matched by an equal advancement in the knowledge of the performance losses under standard working conditions (illumination and load).3–7
So far, discussion on the stability of PSCs has been mainly focused on oxygen,8 water5 and UV light exposure9 as causes of rapid performance degradation in PSCs. These extrinsic factors have been associated with a number of degradation mechanisms that can be retarded using the sealing technologies industrialised for organic electronics, which provide oxygen and humidity barriers and protection against UV light.10,11 Conversely, prolonged exposure to solar cell operational temperatures (above 50 °C) can cause severe degradation, which cannot be avoided by sealing the PSCs. These, so called intrinsic losses have been mostly associated with the degradation of organic materials and metal contacts within PSCs.3,12,13 Indeed, significant progress has been made by replacing the organic components with their inorganic counterparts and passivating the interfaces between the different layers composing the device.13–18 Nonetheless, temperature activated formation and migration of ionic defects within the organic–inorganic ABX3 perovskite lattice remain potential sources of instability for perovskite photovoltaics.19–22 Halide anion (X) vacancies have been calculated to show the lowest formation energies,23 with bromide vacancies being favoured over iodide.24 Correspondingly, X vacancies (together with interstitial X) have been shown to be the most mobile defects, followed by cation A and B vacancies.25–27 Several studies indicated that, regardless of particular architectures and constituents within the PSCs, X defects migrate and reversibly accumulate within the perovskite lattice in narrow Debye layers at the interfaces with the charge selective contacts.19,28–34 Depending on voltage and light bias conditioning, accumulation of ions (and their vacancies) partially screens the built-in electric field and possibly creates interfacial electronic trap states, which reduce the charge extraction efficiency.25,30,31,34–43 Ion migration on timescales from 10−1 to 102 s has been widely investigated to explain the hysteresis of current density–voltage (J–V) curves.36,37,40,44–48 However, the impact of X and potentially A and/or B defect formation and migration on PSC performance on timescales above 103 s, which are indicative of long-term stability, remains unknown.49 Little experimental evidence exists on this subject since separating reversible ion migration from any non-reversible long-term degradation is complex under real device working conditions, i.e. prolonged exposure to continuous light and voltage bias.29,39,50–55
In this work, we provide direct evidence of electric field-induced ion migration and its effects on the long-term performance of perovskite solar cells working under different loads. By cooling in situ the active area of working PSCs, we are able to inhibit thermally induced, non-reversible degradation, thereby exposing fully reversible performance losses. Within several hours of operation at the maximum power point (MPP), the reversible losses decrease a significant fraction of the initial PCE, which is followed be a period of stabilization. Supported by modelling and elemental depth profiling, we correlate the reversible performance losses in PSCs to the migration of ion vacancies on timescales (above 103 s) that are significantly longer than those explored so far (from 10−1 to 102 s). These unusually slow dynamics reveal that academic and industrial standards currently in use to assess the performance and stability of solar cells need to be adjusted for PSCs, which exhibit phenomena previously unknown to the photovoltaics community. Importantly, we show that over natural day/night cycles, PSCs that reversibly degrade during the day recover overnight to “start fresh” every morning. Our work paves the way towards developing specific testing protocols, definition of new figures of merits and calculation of energy payback time that are needed to characterize PSCs.
Results and discussion
To study the impact of the long-term ion migration on device performance and stability, we prepared state-of-the-art PSCs, using the mixed halide–cation perovskite composition CH3NH3/CH(NH2)2 Pb Br/I and the antisolvent deposition method on mesoporous TiO2 substrates,56 which enabled the realization of power conversion efficiencies above 20% (see device characterization in ESI†). We tracked the maximum power output of 3 identically prepared devices (device A, B and C in Fig. 1). During the experiment, the devices were kept under 1 Sun-equivalent white LED illumination at MPP (around 0.85 V) and under a N2 atmosphere. Devices A and B were continuously tracked for over 100 hours. As previously reported,3,7,13 the maximum power output traces can be described with a double exponential decay function showing an initial rapid (I in Fig. 1a) and a subsequent slower decay regime (II in Fig. 1a).3,7,13 We have previously shown that the latter (regime II) is due to degradation involving one or more device components, while the early decay (regime I) remains unexplained so far and it will be the main object of this study.3,7 We selected two devices exhibiting very different II regimes: a rather unstable device A (residual power output J0 = 25%, Table 1) and device B showing particularly good stability (residual power output J0 = 84%, Table 1). Since long-term degradation is a convolution of several mechanisms that may abruptly impact the performance,57 it is not surprising that identically prepared devices age differently. However, it is rather unexpected that they have identical time constants for the decay regime I (t1 in Table 1). To isolate regime I from the subsequent degradation (regime II), the maximum power point tracking (MPPT) for device C was stopped after only 5 hours and repeated periodically after leaving the device resting in the dark for a varying number of hours (Fig. 1b). Surprisingly, the initial power output at each cycle was similar or even slightly higher to the previous one, demonstrating that the initial performance losses are fully reversible (regime I) and are thus separated from the subsequent permanent degradation (regime II). The decay traces and exponential fits of devices A, B and C are summarized in Fig. 1c. The residual power output for device C at each cycle (dashed line in Fig. 1c, J0 in Table 1) lies between 0.85 and 0.9, similar to what was extracted for the more stable device B after 100 hours of MPPT. This confirms that the performance losses in device B are mostly reversible, with a marginal contribution of permanent degradation. We repeated this experiment for devices with planar and inverted architectures, varying the electron and hole selective contact materials (see ESI†), with similar conclusions. While we collected data for PSCs prepared with mixed halide–cation perovskites, reversible losses have been observed for a broad range of perovskite compositions.18,52–54,58 Therefore, we confidently conclude that reversible losses are intrinsic to the perovskite as a photovoltaic material and not to specific material composition or device architecture.

Devices were continuously kept at the maximum power point using the standard “perturb and observe” method. The efficiency of all freshly made devices was above 20% (see ESI†) and it dropped to around 17–18% after 2–3 weeks, when the stability data were recorded. Data were normalized to the maximum value, which was usually reached within several minutes of tracking. (a) Devices A and B were continuously tracked for over 100 hours.

It is worth noting that the characteristic times for the reversible degradation/recovery are representative of the native working conditions for solar cells, i.e. day/night cycles. Therefore, a PSC producing energy during the day will have time to recover during the night to “start fresh” every morning. This finding has an important practical implication for establishing industrial benchmarks for ageing and cost/operation time calculations of PSCs.
Reversible performance degradation as a result of light soaking has been previously investigated by Bag et al.52 and Nie et al.54 In both the studies, the authors concluded that the heat from sunlight is responsible for lattice strain and consequent defect formation. In contrast to the existing literature, we studied the reversible losses under real device working conditions, i.e. prolonged exposure to continuous light and voltage bias around MPP. We postulated that the migration of ions and ion defects is the cause of reversible losses. In order to provide direct evidence of ion migration, we deposited a PbI2 layer on top of a CH3NH3PbBr3 perovskite layer in capacitor-like devices, as represented in the schematic in Fig. 2a. These devices were heated to 70 °C in a nitrogen atmosphere and one of the pixels was cyclically biased at +2 and −2 V every 30 minutes (leakage current remained below ±1 mA cm−2). After 16 hours, we found that the biased pixel had changed its colour to black, while the unbiased pixel (also kept at 70 °C) remained yellow, as clearly visible in Fig. 2b. Notably, the colouring of the biased pixel accurately follows the overlap between the top (gold) and the bottom (FTO) electrodes. This suggests that, in response to the electric field, ions migrate between the yellow CH3NH3PbBr3 and PbI2 layers to form the black CH3NH3PbIxBr(3−x) perovskite. We made use of time of flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) to measure the effective elemental changes within the layers.59 From the I2− and Br2− elemental depth profiles shown in Fig. 2c and d, we found that the iodine and bromine distributions are significantly changed in the biased pixel compared to the control one. In particular, we observe strong halide mixing, which results in the formation of black CH3NH3PbIxBr(3−x). This constitutes strong direct evidence that halides can indeed migrate within the perovskite driven by an electric field and not due to thermal activation or electric current.52,60–62

The SnO− signals coming from the fluorine doped SnO2 (FTO glass) are used as a reference, to which all traces in the respective graph are normalized. 
We also analysed the ToF-SIMS depth profiles looking for an indication of organic cation diffusion (by tracing CN− signal). Unfortunately, the depth profiles did not qualitatively correspond to the expected CN− distribution in the control sample (see figure in ESI†) and hence we deemed the analysis inconclusive (we also found a large amount of organic contamination on the surface of the sample). Additionally, we performed energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy on the cross-section of the same device (see figure in ESI†). However, again we could not conclude whether the cations are mobile, largely due to the fact that the technique is not suited for tracing lightweight elements constituting CH3NH3+ ions (the fact that the devices had to be coated with C prior to the analysis, made the analysis even more challenging). Given that it is not trivial to provide direct evidence of organic cation migration, we made use of electric measurements supported by modelling to prove it indirectly.
We used intensity modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) to monitor ion migration during device operation at the voltages highlighted in the J–V curve in the inset in Fig. 3a.63 The photocurrent was allowed to settle at each voltage for 300 s before the frequency scan. Fig. 3a shows the imaginary component of the IMPS frequency spectra. The traces show two features in the high frequency region, which we assign to the resonant frequencies of the charge dynamics within the perovskite layer (above 105 Hz) and the electron/hole charge selective materials (between 104 and 105 Hz).64 The spectra are similar in this region, which suggests that charge transport is not significantly affected by the voltage applied. An additional feature at around 102 Hz is clearly visible in the low frequency region. We have previously associated the 10−1–103 Hz (or 10−3–10 s) resonant frequency window with the ion defect migration within the perovskite crystal lattice.64,65 The migration and accumulation of ionic defects at the interfaces with the charge selective contacts result in the formation of two narrow Debye layers (DLs).34 The qualitative relation between the DL capacitance and the applied voltage was recently derived from the drift diffusion model proposed by Richardson et al.34 Different from the previous report, here we are taking into account processes occurring on both the relatively short timescale of the spectroscopic oscillations (10−3–10 s) and on the longer settling time (300 s) before the start of the frequency scan (Fig. 3b, see the ESI† for more details). Based on the calculations of activation energies for migration of different ionic defects in CH3NH3PbI3, negatively-charged cation vacancies show significantly lower mobility than positively-charged halide vacancies.20,25,26,66–68 Given that cation vacancies are slower than the halide ones, three different scenarios are possible: (I) only halide vacancies are mobile on both spectroscopic (10−3–10 s) and settling (300 s) timescales, while all the other defects remain effectively frozen; (II) cation vacancies are sufficiently mobile to equilibrate within the DLs during the settling time, but they are effectively immobile on the spectroscopic timescale; and (III) both halide and cation vacancies are sufficiently mobile to equilibrate within the DLs on the spectroscopic timescale. We found that the experimental trend in Fig. 3a was best reproduced by the model that accounts for halide vacancy migration, but does not directly account for the slowly moving cation vacancies even on the 300 s settling timescale. This observation suggests that if cation vacancies are effectively mobile, they should migrate over a timescale of hours.
 Fig. 3  (a) Imaginary component frequency spectra of the current response to the light modulated (10% of the stationary value) ∼1 Sun equivalent intensity under different applied voltage biases. Data were normalized to the maximum value corresponding to the peak between 10 and 100 kHz. The inset shows the J–V curve recorded for the same devices at 100 mV s−1 scan rate. (b) Model calculation of the capacitance per unit surface area at the edge of the perovskite layer as a function of the forward applied voltage bias, assuming the negative defects (cation vacancies) as non-mobile, slow or fast, compared to the timescale of the spectroscopic oscillations in the low frequency region (10−1–103 Hz). 
To provide evidence that cation vacancies are effectively mobile we measured the current transient dynamics at short circuit after preconditioning the device at either forward (0.85 V) or reverse (−0.3 V) bias (Fig. 4a). Under each biasing condition, we waited for the current to stabilize for about 20 minutes at 20 °C, before cooling the device to −20 °C and switching it abruptly to short circuit conditions. By cooling down the device, we aimed to retard ion migration and capture the transient dynamics resulting from the initial non-equilibrium ion distribution. Following forward bias preconditioning, the short circuit current (Jsc) rapidly decreased from over 23 mA cm−2 towards a value of around 14 mA cm−2. In contrast, subsequent to preconditioning at reverse bias, Jsc increases from 4 mA cm−2 to around 13 mA cm−2. Notably, in these two experiments Jsc does not relax to the same value over the 100 s over which the transient is measured; there is a secondary slow timescale process which we attribute to the slow motion of cation vacancies. In order to back up this assertion, we calculate the short circuit current based on (I) a model of the perovskite layer in which only halide vacancies are mobile (Fig. 4b, left-hand panel) and (II) a model in which both halide and cation vacancies are mobile (Fig. 4b, right-hand panel) but where cation vacancies move 100 times more slowly than halide vacancies (see the ESI† for further details). It can be seen from Fig. 4 that while the model with immobile cation vacancies is able to qualitatively predict the initial part of the transients, it fails to capture the slow timescale decay. However, the inclusion of slow moving cation vacancies into the model (Fig. 4b, right-hand panel) gives a picture closer to the reality (Fig. 4a) in which there is an initial rapid transient, over tens of seconds, followed by a much longer timescale decay.
 Fig. 4  (a) Current transient dynamics collected from the same device pre-condition for about 20 minutes under forward (0.85 V) or reverse (−0.3 V) bias and cooled to −20 °C before to abruptly switch to short circuit conditions. (b) Modelled current transient dynamics as predicted by the evolution of the potential (left panel – considering only halide vacancy migration, and right panel – considering fast halide and slow cation vacancy migration). (c) The modelled maximum power conversion efficiency (with fast halide and slow cation vacancy migration) over 4 cycles of light and dark shows similar (non-quantitative) reversible performance losses to the experiment in Fig. 1. 
In order to investigate the conjecture that the reversible decay in efficiency shown in Fig. 1 (which occurs over a timescale of around 1 hour) is due to the slow motion of cation vacancies, we simulate the current produced by the device as the light is switched on and off a number of times; the results are shown in Fig. 4c and qualitatively reproduce the behaviour seen in Fig. 1c for device C (plotted in red circles). We conclude, by remarking, that slow cation vacancy motion thus provides a theory that is capable of explaining both the slow timescale decay in transient short circuit current measurements (Fig. 4a) and the reversible decay in efficiency observed in PSCs after prolonged exposure to light (Fig. 1c).
To summarize, we have observed that PSCs degrade reversibly on the timescale of hours regardless of the device architecture. We have also proven that both halide and cation vacancies are mobile (albeit the latter are considerably slower than the former) and their distribution in the perovskite layer can considerably affect charge extraction and, in consequence, the PCE of the device. Fig. 5 shows a simplistic schematic to condense the results of the experiments and model calculations discussed here. The images represent the halide lattice within the perovskite with ionic vacancies. The initial condition (a) describes a stoichiometric amount of anion and cation vacancies, which are randomly distributed in the perovskite lattice as proposed by Walsh et al.69 (b) Up to 102 s (i.e. minutes) after the device was exposed to light and switched to MPP, halide vacancies migrate to form a Debye layer at the interface with hole selective contact, leaving the relatively immobile cation vacancies behind. (c) For timescales longer than 103 s (i.e. hours), cation vacancies form an additional Debye layer at the interface with the electron selective contact, which in turn inhibits charge extraction from the device. Hence we come back to the original experiment shown in Fig. 1. When PSCs are exposed to real operating conditions, slow cation migration is responsible for the reversible losses in the device on the timescale of hours. However, when the device is given several hours to recover in the dark, the ionic distribution returns to the initial state and the device appears to be “fresh”. The strong asymmetry in the activation energy for migration of halide and cation vacancies implies that stabilization times on the order of hours (not minutes as widely believed) are required for PSCs to reach true steady-state working conditions. This implies that traditional solar cell characterization methods, such as measurements of standard J–V curves and incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE) spectra, are usually performed on non-stabilized devices. We propose the maximum power point tracking for several hours as the most reliable method to determine the initial efficiency and the stability of PSCs.

Conclusions
In this work, we investigated the impact of the ionic defect migration on the performance and stability of state-of-the-art perovskite solar cells (PSCs). We provide direct evidence of halide migration within the perovskite as a result of the applied electric field. In line with previous reports, we found that halide vacancies migrate and accumulate at the interface with the hole selective contact on timescales between 10−1 and 102 s. The accumulation of interfacial halide vacancies increases as the applied voltage moves from forward to reverse bias, which results in the occurrence of the well-known hysteresis in the current density–voltage curves of PSCs. In addition to what has been explored previously, we propose that cation vacancies migrating on significantly longer timescales (above 103 s) than halide vacancies play a key role in the long-term performance of PSCs. We show that the accumulation of cation vacancies at the electron contact induces reversible performance losses that abate the initial efficiency of state-of-the-art PSCs by about 10–15% over several hours of operation at the maximum power point. Although these losses are not negligible, the initial efficiency is fully recovered when leaving the device in the dark for a comparable amount of time. We verified this behaviour for devices with different architectures over several cycles resembling day/night phases. We show that PSCs recover their initial efficiency during the night and deliver, every morning, the same efficiency as freshly made devices. This unusual behaviour reveals that research and industry standards currently in use to assess the performance and the stability of solar cells need to be reconsidered for PSCs. Our work provides indications for the much needed new testing protocols and figures of merits specifically designed for PSCs.
Methods section
General methods
All the chemicals were purchased from commercial sources and used without further purification. All the solvents were anhydrous and high purity grade.
Solar cells fabrication
Devices were fabricated on fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) coated glass substrates. The substrates were cleaned sequentially with Hellmanex in an ultrasonic bath for 30 min, then washed with acetone and isopropanol, and finally cleaned with oxygen plasma for 5 min. An about 30 nm TiO2 compact layer was deposited on about 150 cm2 of FTO via spray pyrolysis at 450 °C from a precursor solution prepared with 0.4 mL of acetyl acetone (Aldrich), 0.6 mL of titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) solution (Aldrich, 75% in 2-propanol) and 9 mL of ethanol. After spraying, the substrates were left at 450 °C for 5 min, then they were slowly cooled down to room temperature. A mesoporous TiO2 layer was deposited by spin coating for 10 s at 4000 rpm with a ramp of 2000 rpm s−1, using 30 nm particle paste (18NR-T Dyesol) diluted in ethanol to achieve about 150 nm thick layer. After spin coating, the substrate was immediately dried at 100 °C for 10 min and then sintered again at 500 °C for 30 min under dry air flow. Mesoporous TiO2 was doped with lithium by spin coating a 0.1 M solution of Li-TFSI in acetonitrile at 3000 rpm for 30 s. After spin coating, the substrate was dried at 100 °C for 10 min and then sintered again at 500 °C for 30 min, under dry air flow. To minimize water absorption from the atmosphere, after cooling down to 150 °C the substrates were immediately transferred to a nitrogen filled glove box and then kept for further cooling down to room temperature.
The perovskite films were deposited from a precursor solution containing formamidinium iodide (1 M), lead iodide (1.1 M), methylammonium bromide (0.2 M) and lead bromide (0.2 M) in a mixture of anhydrous dimethylformamide:dimethylsulfoxide 4:1 (v:v). The perovskite solution was spin coated using a two-step program at 1000 and 4000 rpm for 10 and 30 s, respectively. During the second step, 100 μL of chlorobenzene was poured on the spinning substrate 15 s prior to the end of the program. The substrates were then annealed at 100 °C for 1 hour in a nitrogen filled glove box.
After perovskite annealing the substrates were cooled down for 1 minute and a spirofluorene linked methoxy triphenylamine (spiro-OMeTAD, from Merck) solution was spun at 4000 rpm for 20 s. The spiro-OMeTAD solution was prepared in chlorobenzene at a concentration of 70 mM, and doped with 50 mol% of bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Li-TFSI, Aldrich) from a stock solution of 1.8 M Li-TFSI in acetonitrile, 330 mol% of tert-butylpyridine (Aldrich) and 3 mol% of Tris(2-(1H-pyrazol-1-yl)-4-tert-butylpyridine)-cobalt(III) Tris(bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide) (Co-complex, Dyesol) from a 0.25 M stock solution of Co-complex in acetonitrile. Finally, 80 nm of gold was deposited by thermal evaporation under high vacuum, using shadow masking to pattern the electrodes.
Solar cell characterisation
The solar cells were measured using a 450 W xenon light source (Oriel). The spectral mismatch between AM1.5G and the simulated illumination was reduced by the use of a Schott K113 Tempax filter (Präzisions Glas & Optik GmbH). The light intensity was recorded using a Si photodiode equipped with an IR-cutoff filter (KG3, Schott) before each measurement. Current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the cells were obtained by applying an external voltage bias while measuring the current response using a digital source meter (Keithley 2400). The cells were masked with a black metal mask (0.16 cm2) to estimate the active area and reduce the influence of scattered light. The devices were stored in dry air and under dark conditions, and they were characterized two days after perovskite film deposition.
The solar cell current transient dynamics (potentiostatic) and the maximum power point tracking data were measured under 1 Sun equivalent white LED illumination using an SP300 biologic potentiostat. Maximum point tracking was done using a home-developed program, which would keep the devices at the maximum power point by creeping oscillation in voltage and which would measure a full J–V curve every 60 minutes. The devices were placed inside an in-house-developed airtight sample holder, which allowed them to be kept under an inert, nitrogen atmosphere. Additionally, the backside metal electrode of the devices was placed against a Peltier element, which with the use of a PID controller would keep the actual temperature of the device at 20 °C regardless of the illumination or ambient temperature.
Intensity modulated photocurrent spectroscopy was performed using Autolab PGSTAT302N according to the procedures reported previously.65
Time of flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS)
Samples were prepared with the following configuration: on top of patterned FTO glass, 10 nm of a compact Al2O3 layer was deposited. Subsequently, a 500 nm layer of CH3PbBr3 was deposited by spin-coating and a 200 nm-thick layer of PbI2 was thermally evaporated. Finally, a 50 nm layer of MoO3 and the Au electrode were thermally evaporated. Two electronically separated devices (pixels) were fabricated on each substrate. Both pixels were heated to 70 °C under nitrogen atmosphere and ambient light conditions. One pixel was cycling biased (±2 V with 1 hour period) for 16 hours. During biasing the currents flowing through the pixel remained below 1 mA cm−2. ToF-SIMS was performed on biased and control pixels according to the method previously reported.13
Drift diffusion simulations
The complete drift diffusion model was published by Richardson et al. elsewhere.34 The details of the calculation are reported in the ESI.†

Broader context
Perovskite solar cells have been recently demonstrated as a potential new photovoltaic technology. Better than any previous photovoltaic material, perovskite combines the advantage of low processing and high power conversion efficiency. Furthermore, perovskite solar cells can be used in tandem with market dominating silicon solar cells to increase their efficiency and thus to lower the price of solar energy. While there are no concerns about their efficiency, very little is known about the stability of perovskite solar cells under illumination and load, i.e. under real working conditions. So far, discussion about stability has been mainly focused on external factors, such as oxygen, water and UV light exposure, which are well-known causes of rapid performance degradation. However, performance losses occur even ruling out any external source of degradation. This work provides a step improvement in our knowledge of this phenomenon and it paves the way towards stable perovskite solar cells.


 	Fig. 1  Maximum power output tracking for 3 identically prepared perovskite solar cells (device A, B and C) measured under UV-filtered 1 Sun equivalent light. Devices were continuously kept at the maximum power point using the standard “perturb and observe” method. The efficiency of all freshly made devices was above 20% (see ESI†) and it dropped to around 17–18% after 2–3 weeks, when the stability data were recorded. Data were normalized to the maximum value, which was usually reached within several minutes of tracking. (a) Devices A and B were continuously tracked for over 100 hours. (b) Device C was cyclically tracked 4 times for 5 hours and it was left in the dark at open circuit in between the consecutive measurements. (c) Experimental data were fitted to an exponential decay (single or double) and the fitting parameters are reported in Table 1.	 

Device A	2.3 ± 0.2	25 ± 1
Device B	2.3 ± 0.2	84 ± 2
Device C, cycle 1	2.1 ± 0.05	90 ± 0.1
Device C, cycle 2	2.0 ± 0.04	87 ± 0.1
Device C, cycle 3	1.9 ± 0.04	85 ± 0.1
Device C, cycle 4	2.0 ± 0.04	88 ± 0.1

 	Fig. 2  (a) Schematics of the sample prepared for the biasing experiment, consisting of two electronically-separated pixels on the same substrate. Both pixels were heated to 70 °C in a N2 atmosphere. Only one pixel was cyclically biased at +2 and −2 V every 30 minutes for 16 hours (biased pixel). (b) Top view image of the sample after biasing (scale in millimetre). Time of flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) depth profiles of the control (c) and biased (d) pixels showing the relative secondary ion intensity of iodine and bromine clusters across the film depth. The SnO− signals coming from the fluorine doped SnO2 (FTO glass) are used as a reference, to which all traces in the respective graph are normalized.	 

 	Fig. 3  (a) Imaginary component frequency spectra of the current response to the light modulated (10% of the stationary value) ∼1 Sun equivalent intensity under different applied voltage biases. Data were normalized to the maximum value corresponding to the peak between 10 and 100 kHz. The inset shows the J–V curve recorded for the same devices at 100 mV s−1 scan rate. (b) Model calculation of the capacitance per unit surface area at the edge of the perovskite layer as a function of the forward applied voltage bias, assuming the negative defects (cation vacancies) as non-mobile, slow or fast, compared to the timescale of the spectroscopic oscillations in the low frequency region (10−1–103 Hz).	 

 	Fig. 4  (a) Current transient dynamics collected from the same device pre-condition for about 20 minutes under forward (0.85 V) or reverse (−0.3 V) bias and cooled to −20 °C before to abruptly switch to short circuit conditions. (b) Modelled current transient dynamics as predicted by the evolution of the potential (left panel – considering only halide vacancy migration, and right panel – considering fast halide and slow cation vacancy migration). (c) The modelled maximum power conversion efficiency (with fast halide and slow cation vacancy migration) over 4 cycles of light and dark shows similar (non-quantitative) reversible performance losses to the experiment in Fig. 1.	 

 	Fig. 5  Schematics of the evolution of the ion distribution within the perovskite layer sandwiched between the electron and hole selective contacts under solar cell working conditions: (a) initial conditions, (b) non-stabilized conditions on the timescale of minutes and (c) the stabilized condition on the timescale of hours.
