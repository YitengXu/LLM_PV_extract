    , Accepted 7th February 2013First published on 8th February 2013AbstractD–π–A fluorescent dye YNI-2 with two pyridyl groups as an electron-withdrawing–injecting anchoring group possessing a high coordinate bonding ability to Lewis acid sites on the TiO2 surface, which can lead to high dye loading on the TiO2 film and efficient electron injection, has been developed as a new type of D–π–A dye sensitizer for dye-sensitized solar cells.
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) based on dye sensitizers, which are one of the third generation photovoltaic cells, have received considerable attention from the viewpoint of their interesting construction and operational principles, high power conversion efficiency, and low cost of production.1–9 In particular, donor–acceptor π-conjugated (D–π–A) dyes with both electron-donating (D) and electron-accepting (A) groups linked by π-conjugated bridges, which possess broad and intense absorption spectral features, would be expected to be one of the most promising organic dye sensitizers.2–9 Most of the D–π–A dyes for DSSCs developed so far possess a carboxylic acid, cyanoacrylic acid or rhodanine-3-acetic acid moiety which acts as an electron acceptor as well as an anchoring group for attachment on a TiO2 surface. The carboxyl group enables a good electron communication between the dye and TiO2 by forming a strong bidentate bridging linkage with Brønsted acid sites (surface-bound hydroxyl groups, Ti–OH) on the TiO2 surface. In our previous work, on the other hand, we found that a new type of D–π–A dye sensitizers with a pyridyl group as an electron-withdrawing–injecting anchoring group were predominantly adsorbed on the TiO2 film through coordinate bonding between the pyridyl group of the dye and the Lewis acid site (exposed Tin+ cations) on the TiO2 surface.9 It was demonstrated that a new type of D–π–A dye sensitizers can inject electrons efficiently from the pyridyl group to the conduction band (CB) of the TiO2 electrode through coordinate bonding, rather than the bidentate bridging linkage of conventional D–π–A dye sensitizers with carboxyl groups. Very recently, photovoltaic performances of DSSCs based on D–D–π–A organic dyes and a series of porphyrin-based dyes with pyridyl groups were reported by Zheng et al. and Coutsolelos et al., respectively.10,11 On the other hand, He et al. reported high photovoltaic performance and the long-term stability of DSSC based on a porphyrin dye with 8-hydroxylquinoline as the anchoring group.12 However, the amounts (ca. 5.0–8.0 × 1016 molecules per cm2) of dye sensitizers with a pyridyl group adsorbed on the TiO2 film are lower than those of dye sensitizers with a carboxyl group,9–11 and thus the low dye loading leads to low light-harvesting efficiency (LHE).
In this work, to provide a direction in molecular design toward creating efficient D–π–A dye sensitizers with pyridyl groups, we have designed and synthesized D–π–A fluorescent dye YNI-2 with two pyridyl groups as electron-withdrawing–injecting anchoring group and a thiophene unit as a π-bridge (Scheme 1; see ESI† for the detailed synthetic procedures). We have demonstrated that the dye YNI-2 exhibits a high coordinate bonding ability, leading to not only a high dye loading on the TiO2 film, but also efficient electron injection from the dye to the CB of TiO2, compared with those of YNI-1 with two pyridyl groups, but without a thiophene unit.
 Scheme 1  Structures of D–π–A fluorescent dyes YNI1-1 and YNI-2. 
The absorption and fluorescence spectra of YNI-1 and YNI-2 in THF are shown in Fig. 1 and their spectral data are summarized in Table 1. The dye YNI-2 in THF shows a strong absorption band at around 380 nm, which is assigned to the intramolecular charge-transfer (ICT) excitation from the electron donor moiety (carbazole) to the electron acceptor moiety (pyridyl group). The absorption maximum (λabsmax) for the ICT band of YNI-2 occurs at a longer wavelength by ca. 50 nm than that of YNI-1. The molar extinction coefficient (ε) for the ICT band of YNI-2 is ca. 46000 M−1 cm−1, which is higher than that (ca. 22000 M−1 cm−1) of YNI-1. These results show that the introduction of two thiophene units on the carbazole skeleton expands the π conjugation in the dye and thus results in red-shift and broadening of ICT band, and the enhancement of ε. The fluorescence maxima (λflmax) for YNI-1 and YNI-2 occur at 387 and 448 nm, respectively. The dye YNI-2 (Φf = 0.67) exhibits a higher fluorescence quantum yield (Φf) than YNI-1 (Φf = 0.33). The MO calculations indicate that the longest excitation bands were mainly assigned to the transition from HOMO to LUMO, for which HOMOs were mostly localized on the carbazole moiety for YNI-1 and the thienylcarbazole moiety for YNI-2, respectively, and LUMOs were mostly localized on the pyridylcarbazole moiety for YNI-1 and the thienylpyridine moiety for YNI-2, respectively (see Fig. S2 in the ESI†). The changes in the calculated electron density accompanied by the first electron excitation for the two dyes reveal a strong ICT from the carbazole moiety to the pyridyl group upon photoexcitation (see Fig. S2 in the ESI†).

 Fig. 1  (a) Absorption and (b) fluorescence spectra of YNI-1 and YNI-2 in THF. 
The absorption spectra of the dyes adsorbed on the TiO2 film are shown in Fig. 2. The absorption peak wavelengths of YNI-1 and YNI-2 are red-shifted by 23 nm and 27 nm, respectively, compared with those in THF. When chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) was employed as a coadsorbent to prevent dye aggregation on the TiO2 surface, the absorption peak wavelength is blue-shifted by 17 nm for both YNI-1 and YNI-2, although the peak wavelength is still red-shifted compared with that in THF.

Thus, to elucidate the adsorption states of the dyes YNI-1 and YNI-2 on TiO2 nanoparticles, we measured the FTIR spectra of the dye powders and the dyes adsorbed on TiO2 nanoparticles (Fig. 3). For the powders of the two dyes, the characteristic stretching bands for CN or CC were clearly observed at around 1589 and 1473 cm−1 for YNI-1 and 1590, 1481, and 1446 cm−1 for YNI-2. When the dye YNI-1 was adsorbed on the TiO2 surface, the stretching band at around 1589 cm−1 is shifted by 6 nm to a higher wavenumber, that is, the band at around 1595 cm−1 can be assigned to pyridyl groups hydrogen-bonded to Brønsted acid sites on the TiO2 surface. In the FTIR spectra of YNI-2 adsorbed on TiO2 nanoparticles, on the other hand, the band at 1590 cm−1 disappeared completely and a new and strong band appeared at around 1614 cm−1, which can be assigned to pyridyl groups coordinated to the Lewis acid sites on the TiO2 surface. These observations indicate that the dye YNI-1 is predominantly adsorbed on the TiO2 surface through hydrogen bonding at Brønsted acid sites, whereas the dye YNI-2 is predominantly adsorbed on the TiO2 surface through coordinate bonding at Lewis acid sites, although there are also a few dye molecules adsorbed at both acid sites. These results reveal that hydrogen bonding and coordinate bonding are responsible for the large red-shift of the absorption peak wavelength for YNI-1 and YNI-2 adsorbed on TiO2 nanoparticles (Fig. 2).

The electrochemical properties of the two dyes were determined using cyclic voltammetry (CV; see Fig. S1 and Table S1 in the ESI†). The oxidation peaks for YNI-1 and YNI-2 were observed at 0.99 and 0.58 V vs. ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+), respectively. The corresponding reduction peak for YNI-2 appeared at 0.48 V, whereas no reduction peak was observed for YNI-1. These results show that the oxidized state of YNI-2 is stable, but that of YNI-1 is unstable. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of two dyes were evaluated from the spectral analyses and the CV data (Table 1). The HOMO energy levels of YNI-1 and YNI-2 were 1.54 and 1.22 V vs. the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE), respectively, thus indicating that the HOMO energy levels are more positive than the I3−/I− redox potential (0.4 V). This ensures an efficient regeneration of the oxidized dyes by electron transfer from the I3−/I− redox couple in the electrolyte. The LUMO energy levels of YNI-1 and YNI-2 were −1.95 and −1.75 V, respectively. Evidently, these LUMO levels are higher than the energy level of the CB of TiO2 (−0.5 V), so that the two dyes can efficiently inject electrons to the TiO2 electrode. Therefore, it was revealed that the red-shift of the ICT absorption band for YNI-2 relative to YNI-1 is attributed to destabilization of the HOMO level and stabilization of the LUMO level by the introduction of thiophene units to the π-conjugation system of the dye, resulting in a decrease in the HOMO–LUMO band gap.
The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra and the photocurrent–voltage (I–V) curves for the DSSCs based on YNI-1 and YNI-2 are shown in Fig. 4. The photovoltaic performance parameters are collected in Table 1. It is worth mentioning that the maximum adsorption amount of dyes adsorbed on TiO2 for YNI-2 is twice as much as that of YNI-1 (4.8 × 1016 and 9.9 × 1016 molecules per cm2 for YNI-1 and YNI-2, respectively). An increase in the adsorption amount of YNI-2 relative to YNI-1 is attributed to the reasonable angle between two thienylpyridine moieties as well as the accumulated electron density on the nitrogen atom of the pyridyl groups due to a large planar π-conjugated system extending from the electron donor moiety to the electron acceptor moiety by the introduction of a thiophene unit, leading to the construction of molecular structures capable of forming strong coordinate bonding between the two pyridyl groups of dyes and the Lewis acid sites on the TiO2 surface (for a schematic representation of YNI-1 and YNI-2 on the TiO2 surface, see Fig. S4 in the ESI†). The short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) and solar energy-to-electricity conversion yield (η) for YNI-2 (4.72 mA cm−2 and 1.61%) are much higher than those for YNI-1 (1.84 mA cm−2 and 0.57%). The IPCE value of YNI-2 exceeds 65% in the range of 390 to 435 nm, with a maximum value (67%) at 430 nm, which is higher than that of YNI-1 (47% at 415 nm). The IPCE spectra are red-shifted compared with the absorption spectra of the dyes adsorbed on the TiO2 film (Fig. 2). This red-shift may be associated with the light absorption of the TiO2 film and/or the interaction between the adsorbed dyes and the electrolyte. The open-circuit photovoltage (Voc) of YNI-1 (492 mV) is lower than that of YNI-2 (556 mV). Thus, the lower Voc value for YNI-1 may be attributed to faster charge recombination between the injected electrons in the CB of TiO2 and I3− ions in the electrolyte, arising from the approach of I3− ions to the TiO2 surface due to both the relatively compact molecular size and the low dye loading on the TiO2 electrode (in fact, the dye coverage (θ) of the TiO2 surface for YNI-1 (θ = 0.22) is lower than that of YNI-2 (θ = 0.44)). Interestingly, when the adsorption amount of YNI-2 is 3.1 × 1016 molecules per cm2, the maximum IPCE and η values for YNI-2 were 62% and 1.47% (Fig. 4 and Table 1), respectively, which are still higher than those for YNI-1 in the maximum adsorption amount of dyes (4.8 × 1016 molecules per cm2). Consequently, the higher photovoltaic performance of YNI-2 is attributed to not only the red-shift and broadening of the absorption band and the stable oxidized state of the dye, but also to efficient electron injection by the formation of strong coordinate bonding to Lewis acid sites on the TiO2 surface.
 Fig. 4  (a) IPCE spectra and (b) I–V curves of DSSCs based on YNI-1 and YNI-2 under the adsorption condition of 0.1 mM or 0.02 mM dye solution in THF. CDCA was not employed. 
In conclusion, as a new type of D–π–A dye sensitizer for DSSCs, we have designed and synthesized D–π–A fluorescent dye YNI-2 with two pyridyl groups as an electron-withdrawing–injecting anchoring group. It was found that the introduction of two thienylpyridines to the π-conjugation system of the dye can lead to the red-shift and broadening of the ICT band, and also high dye loading on the TiO2 film and efficient electron injection, due to the formation of strong coordinate bonding to Lewis acid sites on the TiO2 surface. We demonstrate that a key point for creating efficient dye sensitizers with pyridyl groups is to design molecular structures capable of forming strong coordinate bonding between the pyridyl groups of dyes and the Lewis acid sites on the TiO2 surface.
