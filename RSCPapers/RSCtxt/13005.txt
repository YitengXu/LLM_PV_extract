    , Accepted 23rd May 2021First published on 24th May 2021AbstractThe electrochemical conversion of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) into high value-added chemicals has attracted much attention. Owing to the complexity of the electrochemical process, there are many faulty operations and misleading results reported in the literature. The central objective of this work is to establish a vigorous assessment protocol for electrochemical conversion of HMF. To this end, two typical electrocatalysts, i.e., commercial Pt/C and nickel nanoparticles, are assembled on catalyst supports including glassy carbon electrodes, carbon paper and nickel foam. The catalytic activity and product distribution of HMF conversion using the electrodes are investigated. The effects of electrode preparation, HMF stability, pH values of the electrolyte, electrolyte impurities, cell configurations and product quantification on HMF conversion are systematically studied. The results show that HMF is unstable when the pH of the electrolyte is higher than 12 or lower than 2. The conversion of HMF is dependent on the properties of support materials, agitation of electrolytes, and the protective atmosphere of electrolytes. Notably, the presence of ppm-levels of impurities such as Fe3+, Cu2+ and Ni2+ in electrolyte solutions accelerates HMF electro-oxidation but shows limited effects on HMF hydrogenation. Notably, using Pt/C as a catalyst, a current density of 0.84 mA cm−2 is obtained at 1.6 V using the electrolyte with 5 ppm Cu2+, which is 3.5 times that resulting from using the electrolyte free of Cu2+. Four electrochemical cells including an undivided cell and H-type cells separated by a Nafion 117 membrane, anion membrane and salt bridge are evaluated for HMF conversion. When nickel foam is used as a catalyst support, the H-type cell with a salt bridge and the undivided cell are not suitable for HMF oxidation because of the cracking of the nickel foam. When the HMF concentration in the electrolyte is less than 20 mM, the H-type cell with a Nafion 117 membrane is more suitable for HMF conversion.
1. Introduction
As one of the most widely studied biomass-derived molecules, 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) can be selectively oxidized and/or hydrogenated into many value-added products, such as 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA), 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furancarboxylic acid (HFCA), 2,5-dimethylfuran (DMF), and 2,5-bis(hydroxymethyl)furan (DHMF).1–8 The extensive use of HMF derivatives can be found in the recent work of Lee's group.1 Generally, HMF conversion is usually conducted using a thermal catalytic method, which requires high temperature and high pressure of O2 or H2. Electrochemical conversion of HMF is a promising alternative method to the conventional heterogeneous catalytic process due to the following advantages: mild experimental conditions (i.e., ambient temperature and pressure), free of hazardous chemical oxidants/reductants and superior product selectivity.9–13 For the electrochemical conversion of HMF, the product selectivity and HMF conversion can be tuned by optimizing the applied potential. In addition, the electrochemical process can be powered by renewable sources such as solar and wind energy, which could reduce the cost of the process. Owing to these merits, efforts have been devoted to exploring electrochemical conversion of HMF since the pioneering work conducted by Grabowski et al.14 The main focus on this research topic lies on searching for high-performance electrocatalysts with excellent activity and product selectivity. While this focus on various electrocatalysts has made great progress in the field, there are plenty of faulty operations and misleading results reported in the literature. It thus has become increasingly urgent to build a rigorous assessment protocol for evaluating electrocatalysts. Unfortunately, owing to the complexity of the electrochemical reactions, such a protocol is lacking.
For electrochemical conversion of HMF, there are several uncertain factors such as electrode preparation, HMF stability, electrolyte impurities, cell configuration and product quantification to which special attention should be paid to ensure an accurate assessment of the electrochemical process. For instance, since the kinetics of HMF electro-oxidation increases with increasing electrolyte pH values, high activity and product selectivity can be achieved at large pH values (e.g. 14). However, HMF is not stable in strong alkaline solutions.15–17 Many publications reported the electrochemical conversion of HMF in the electrolyte with a pH value of 14. Under this circumstance, the electrochemical conversion of HMF is entangled with its degradation, which leads to inaccurate catalytic results. Therefore, more efforts are required to explore the pH effects and present a solution to address this issue, which is crucial to HMF conversion efficiency. Moreover, HMF conversion is usually performed in an H-type cell equipped with a Nafion membrane,16,18,19 but recent reports have mentioned that Nafion membranes allow the transport of small organic molecules.20,21 The configuration of the experimental set-up used in the electrochemical conversion of HMF should also be carefully checked.
Herein, we systematically studied various parameters that affect the catalytic activity and product yield of HMF conversion using commercial Pt/C and Ni nanoparticles. The stability of HMF in pH 14, 13, 12, 9, 6, 2, and 0 solutions was investigated by monitoring the HMF concentration via high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The effects of impurities including Fe3+, Cu2+ and Ni2+ in the electrolyte on the electro-oxidation and hydrogenation of HMF were explored. The activities of HMF electrocatalytic oxidation and hydrogenation under different experimental conditions were carefully evaluated. HMF oxidation was conducted in four electrochemical cells including an undivided cell and H-type cells separated by a Nafion 117 membrane, anion membrane and salt bridge. The product distribution from each cell was investigated by HPLC, and the issues related to the application of these four cells were also discussed.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Chemicals and materials
HMF (99%, Aladdin Biochemical Technology Co., Ltd), FDCA (98%, Aladdin Biochemical Technology Co., Ltd), diformylfuran (DFF, 98%, TCI, America), HFCA (98%, TCI, America), 5-formyl-2-furancarboxylic (FFCA, 98%, TCI, America), Fe(NO3)3·9H2O (>98.5%, Tianjin Damao Chemical Reagent Factory), Cu(NO3)2·3H2O (99%, Guangzhou Chemical Reagent Factory), Ni(NO3)2·6H2O (>98%, Tianjin Damao Chemical Reagent Factory), KOH (semiconductor grade 99.99%, Macklin Biochemical Co., Ltd), and H2SO4 (98%, Guangzhou Chemical Reagent Factory) were used without further purification. All aqueous solutions were prepared using deionized water. Carbon fiber paper (CF, TGP-H-060) was purchased from Shanghai Hesen Electric Co., Ltd. Nickel foam (NF, Tianjin Incole Union Technology Co., Ltd) was cut into slices with dimensions of 2 cm × 2 cm before use. Ni nanoparticles with a diameter of 20–100 nm were purchased from Macklin Biochemical Co., Ltd. A commercial Pt/C catalyst (60 wt%) was purchased from the E-TEK company.
2.2. Electrode preparation
Ni@CF, Pt/C@CF, Ni@NF, and Pt/C@NF were prepared as follows: Ni and Pt/C powders were dispersed in a mixed solution containing 1.5 mL of deionized water, 300 μL of isopropanol, 180 μL of ethylene glycol, 20 μL of 5 wt% Nafion solution and 2 mL of ethanol by sonication for 30 min to obtain a homogeneous catalyst ink. Then, this catalyst ink was loaded onto the surfaces of CF and NF via a coating process. The experimental details can be seen from the authors' previous work.22–24 Unless otherwise noted, the loadings of the catalyst in CF, NF and glassy carbon (GC) electrodes were ca. 64 μg cm−2, 2.2 mg cm−2 and 25.6 μg cm−2, respectively.
2.3. Electrochemical measurements
Electrochemical measurements were performed using a CHI 660E electrochemical workstation with a three-electrode system. A Hg/HgO electrode and a graphite rod were used as the reference and counter electrodes, respectively. The as-prepared Ni@CF, Pt/C@CF, Ni@NF, and Pt/C@NF were directly used as the working electrode. The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) were conducted in 0.1 M KOH solution, while the HMF electrocatalytic oxidation and hydrogenation were conducted in a solution of 0.1 M KOH and 5 mM HMF. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) measurements were performed with a scan rate of 5 mV s−1 in an undivided electrolytic cell. For product analysis, chronoamperometric (CA) tests were carried out in four cells including an undivided cell and H-type cells separated by a Nafion 117 membrane, anion membrane and salt bridge. The electrolyte in the working electrode compartment was 20 mL of 0.1 M KOH and 5 mM HMF solution. The electrolyte in the counter electrode compartment was 20 mL of 0.1 M KOH solution. CA tests were carried out at 1.76 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). Electrochemical measurements were conducted at ambient temperature. All the potentials in this work were converted to the RHE scale.
2.4. HMF stability tests
The stability of HMF in solutions with varying pH values of 14, 13, 12, 9, 6, 2, and 0 was investigated by monitoring the HMF concentration as a function of time using HPLC. In particular, the effects of dissolved O2 and catalysts on HMF stability were studied. During the experiments, the solution was sealed to prevent evaporation.
2.5. Product analysis
To analyze the products of HMF oxidation, 10 μL of the electrolyte solution during CA measurements was taken from the electrolytic cell, diluted to 1 mL with deionized water, and then analyzed by HPLC (Agilent 1260 Infinity II, Agilent Technologies). The HPLC was equipped with an ultraviolet-visible detector at an adsorption wavelength of 265 nm and a 4.6 mm × 250 mm Shim-pack GWS 5 μm C18 column. The eluent solvent is a mixture of 5 mM ammonium formate solution and methanol. Separation was accomplished using an isocratic elution of 70% ammonium formate solution and 30% methanol. The flow rate was 0.5 mL min−1, and the temperature of the column was kept at 30 °C. The quantification of HMF and its oxidation products was carried out based on the calibration of the standard compounds. HMF conversion (%) and the yields (%) of oxidation products were calculated using eqn (1) and (2), respectively. (1) (2)
3. Results and discussion
3.1. HMF stability
Many previous studies on HMF conversion were conducted in a solution with a pH value of 14.25 However, HMF is known to be unstable in a basic solution especially in a solution with a pH value of 14.16 In this context, the direct correlation of the catalyst activity with the HMF concentration would remain an issue. Thus, the stability of HMF in 1 M KOH under different conditions was first tested. Fig. 1 shows that HMF concentrations in all the cases decrease with increasing time. The losses of HMF reach 10 and 40% after 2 and 8 h under air conditions, respectively. Moreover, the degradation of HMF is faster in solutions saturated with oxygen, suggesting that oxygen could facilitate HMF degradation. When the Pt/C or Ni catalyst is present in the solution, the degradation of HMF is further accelerated. In particular, HMF degradation is maximized in the presence of Ni catalyst and oxygen gas. These results indicate that an electrolyte solution with a pH value of 14 is not appropriate for evaluating the catalyst activity in HMF conversion because the decrease of HMF could be attributed to both the electrochemical reaction and the degradation of HMF.
 Fig. 1  Stability of HMF in 1.0 M KOH (pH 14) at room temperature under different conditions. The concentration of HMF is 5 mM, and the solutions were kept still during the test. 
The effect of pH values (14, 13, 12, 9, 6, 2, and 0) on the stability of HMF is further studied as shown in Fig. S1.† Fig. S2† shows the color changes of the solutions at different pH values over time. It can be seen that the colors of the solutions with pH values of 13 and 14 are deepened, while the colors of the solutions with pH values of 12, 9, 6, 2 and 0 have no significant change over time. In Fig. S1,† the HMF loss is only 10% in a solution with a pH value of 13 for 8 h, which is significantly lower than the loss in solutions with a pH value of 14. The losses of HMF in solutions with pH values of 6 and 9 are negligible, manifesting that HMF is stable in this pH range. In contrast, there are noticeable HMF losses in acidic (pH = 0 and 2) and alkaline solutions (pH = 14, 13 and 12). The losses of HMF in solutions with pH values of 0 and 2 reach 18% and 16% after 8 h, respectively, which are larger than that in solution with a pH value of 13.
3.2. Electrochemical activity
The electrochemical activity of HMF hydrogenation and oxidation over the Ni catalyst in solutions with different pH values was studied as shown in Fig. 2(a) and (b), respectively. The corresponding H2O electrochemical reduction and oxidation can be seen in Fig. S3.† Comparing the activities of the HER and HMF electrochemical hydrogenation, the largest current density is obtained using an electrolyte with a pH value of 0. This result shows that a solution with a pH value of 0 is more suitable for HMF hydrogenation. In Fig. 2(b), the best activity of HMF oxidation is obtained using a solution with a pH value of 14. However, as mentioned before, HMF is more easily degraded in strong alkaline (e.g. pH = 14) and acidic solutions (e.g. pH = 0 and 2). Taking both the activity and stability into consideration, the electrolyte with a pH value of 13 may be a good choice for HMF hydrogenation and oxidation.

For electrochemical measurements, the active metal particles are always supported by conductive materials. To reveal the intrinsic activity of the metal particles, it is necessitated that the supporting materials are inert or much less active. To address this issue, three typical catalyst supports including CF, NF and GC were employed to evaluate the electrocatalytic activity of the Pt/C and Ni catalysts. The catalyst powders are transferred into the support, and their activity toward HMF oxidation and hydrogenation was studied as shown in Fig. 3, S4 and S5.† It reveals that all the three supports exhibit negligible activity toward HMF oxidation and hydrogenation as compared with those of the Pt/C and Ni catalysts. For instance, for the HMF oxidation, the Ni@CF, Ni@NF and Ni@GC exhibit current densities of 0.5, 8.42 and 0.35 mA cm−2 at a potential of 1.6 V, respectively, which are much larger than those of CF (0.01 mA cm−2), NF (0.77 mA cm−2) and GC (0.02 mA cm−2).
 Fig. 3  LSV curves of (a and c) HMF hydrogenation and the HER, and (b and d) HMF oxidation and the OER over the Pt/C@CF, Pt/C@NF, CF, and NF recorded with a scan rate of 5 mV s−1. The solid lines are the curves obtained using a solution of 0.1 M KOH and 5 mM HMF, while the dashed lines are those obtained using a solution of 0.1 M KOH. 
Furthermore, since CF is widely utilized as a catalyst support, the effect of the surface properties of CF on the catalytic activity was studied. The surface properties of CF are varied via a treatment of H2SO4. The specific procedures are listed as follows: a piece of CF with an effective area of 1 cm2 was soaked in 0.5 M H2SO4 at 80 °C for 4 h, and then washed with ethanol and deionized water three times. As shown in Fig. S6,† the Pt/C@CF catalyst exhibits better HMF hydrogenation, HMF oxidation, HER, and OER activities when the CF support is treated with H2SO4. Specifically, after the CF is treated with H2SO4, the current densities of HMF oxidation and hydrogenation are 0.47 and 37.4 mA cm−2 at 1.7 V and −0.6 V, respectively, which are 1.7 and 1.2 times those of the original CF. Similar OER and HER activity enhancements are observed after the treatment. In contrast, when the Ni nanoparticles are used as a catalyst, the surface properties of CF have a limited effect on HMF hydrogenation, whereas an increase in the activity of HMF oxidation is observed as shown in Fig. S7.† The HER and OER activities of the Ni nanoparticles are not greatly affected by the surface properties of the CF support.
Previous studies have revealed that the impurities in the electrolyte especially the metal ions could affect the electrocatalytic activity.26–28 In this work, traces of Cu2+, Fe3+ and Ni2+ metal ions were added into the electrolyte as impurities to study their effects on the activity of HMF hydrogenation and oxidation. Fig. S8† shows the LSV curves of HMF hydrogenation and the HER over the Pt/C@CF. It can be seen that the addition of Cu2+ has no effect on the HER, but it can enhance the activity of HMF hydrogenation. The current density increases with increasing Cu2+ concentration as shown in Fig. S8(d).† The addition of Fe3+ and Ni2+ slightly increases the HER activity. Similar to Cu2+, Fe3+ improves the activity of HMF hydrogenation. In contrast, the addition of Ni2+ compromises the activity of HMF hydrogenation.

Fig. 4 shows the influence of the three metal ions on the activity of HMF oxidation over the Pt/C@CF. In Fig. 4(a), with the addition of Cu2+ into the electrolyte, the LSV curve of the OER shows negligible variations, indicating that the addition of Cu2+ has limited effect on the OER. However, the activity of HMF oxidation can be significantly enhanced after adding Cu2+. Notably, at 1.6 V, a current density of 0.84 mA cm−2 is obtained using the electrolyte with 5 ppm Cu2+, which is 3.5 times that resulting from using the electrolyte free of Cu2+. In addition, the onset potential of HMF electro-oxidation shifts from 1.58 to 1.43 V with the addition of Cu2+. The effects of Fe3+ and Ni2+ on the activity of HMF oxidation are less significant as compared with that of Cu2+ as shown in Fig. 4(b) and (c). Fe3+ can significantly enhance the activity of the OER. To further study the effects of Cu2+ on HMF oxidation, different amounts of Cu2+ were added as shown in Fig. 4(d). It can be seen that the increase of Cu2+ amount greatly accelerates HMF electro-oxidation, but has no clear effect on the OER activity (see Fig. S9†). For instance, at 1.6 V, with the addition of 20 ppm Cu2+ into the electrolyte, the current density of HMF oxidation reaches 1.85 mA cm−2, which is much larger than those obtained using the electrolyte with 10 ppm (1.35 mA cm−2), 5 ppm (0.84 mA cm−2), 1 ppm (0.60 mA cm−2), 500 ppb (0.49 mA cm−2), 100 ppb (0.43 mA cm−2) and 1 ppb (0.23 mA cm−2) Cu2+. The onset potential of HMF oxidation continuously shifts to a negative potential with increasing Cu2+ amounts in the electrolyte. To verify the promoting role of Cu2+, the CF support free of any catalysts was used for HMF electro-oxidation. The electrocatalytic results shown in Fig. S10† are consistent with those obtained in the presence of the Pt/C catalyst. These findings suggest that the promoting role of Cu2+ is independent of the catalyst composition. Admittedly, the details of the mechanism are currently not clear. Further mechanistic studies are currently in progress. Results will be reported in the near future.

The effects of the stirring of the electrolyte and the protective atmosphere of the electrolyte on the catalytic activity are also studied. Fig. S11† shows the effect of stirring on the current density. For the Pt/C@CF, the activity of HMF hydrogenation is enhanced by stirring, while that of HMF oxidation is not significantly affected by stirring. Under the conditions of stirring and not stirring, the current densities of Pt/C@CF for HMF hydrogenation are −30.9 and −23.8 mA cm−2 at −0.6 V, respectively, while those for HMF oxidation are both 0.28 mA cm−2 at 1.6 V. For the Ni/CF, both the HMF hydrogenation and oxidation activities are increased by stirring as shown in Fig. S12.† For example, at −0.6 and 1.6 V, the current densities for HMF hydrogenation and oxidation under stirring increased to −9.7 and 1.2 mA cm−2, respectively. Fig. S13 and S14† show the effect of gaseous atmosphere on electrocatalytic activity. Two gases including N2 and O2 were purged into the electrolyte during the electrochemical tests. The results show that the presence of O2 has limited effects on HMF oxidation by the catalysts, which is consistent with the results of the OER study reported by Koper's group.29
3.3. Product analysis
HMF electro-oxidation is usually carried out in an H-type cell equipped with a Nafion membrane, which is supposed to facilitate the cation ion transport while blocking organic product diffusion.11,30,31 However, some organic molecules, i.e., methanol, can penetrate through Nafion membranes, which leads to inaccuracy for product quantification.20 Therefore, more efforts are required to address this issue. In this work, HMF electro-oxidation is conducted in four electrochemical cells including an undivided cell and H-type cells separated by a Nafion 117 membrane, anion membrane and salt bridge. Fig. S15† shows the digital photos of the cells. The product yield of HMF oxidation from each cell is systematically investigated, and the issues related with these four cells are discussed in detail. First, HMF and its electro-oxidation products including FDCA, HFCA, FFCA and DFF are quantified using HPLC as shown in Fig. S16.†Fig. 5 shows the product distribution of HMF electro-oxidation by the Pt/C@NF using these four electrochemical cells. When a Nafion 117 membrane is used, the concentration of FDCA increases with increasing electrolysis time, and a maximum yield of 67.5% can be obtained at 120 C as shown in Fig. 5(a). Meanwhile, the concentration of HMF decreases with increasing electrolysis time, and the largest conversion of 86.7% is achieved at 120 C. The concentrations of HFCA and FFCA are negligible relative to that of FDCA. In addition, the electrolyte color changes from yellow to colorless, and the NF remains intact after the electrolysis as shown in Fig. S17.† Additionally, the carbon balance of HMF as the charge was passed is presented in Fig. S18.† In Fig. 5(b), when an anion membrane is used, both FDCA concentration and HMF conversion at 120 C are lower than those obtained using the H-type cell equipped with a Nafion 117 membrane. The electrolyte color changes from yellow to light yellow, and the NF turns light green as shown in Fig. S19.† In Fig. 5(c), when a salt bridge is used, the FDCA yield and HMF conversion are similar to those obtained using the H-type cell equipped with an anion membrane. However, the electrolyte color changes from yellow to green, and the NF is completely broken. NF fragments can be seen from the electrolyte as shown in Fig. S20.† The green species on the NF may be NiO and/or NiOOH produced by NF oxidation. This oxidation process can lead to the dissolution and fracture of the NF. Among these four cells, the highest HMF conversion is obtained at 120 C using the undivided cell as shown in Fig. 5(d). When the undivided cell is used, the yield of FDCA at 120 C is close to that obtained using the H-type cell separated by a Nafion 117 membrane. However, similar to the H-type cell equipped with a salt bridge, the electrolyte color in the undivided cell changes from yellow to green, and the NF is also broken as shown in Fig. S21.† Fig. S22† shows the photographs of the Pt/C@NF before and after HMF electrolysis using the undivided cell. For the H-type cells, it should be pointed out that HMF oxidation products are not detected in the cathode cell, but a trace of HMF is detected in the cathode cell separated by an anion membrane as shown in Fig. S23.†
 Fig. 5  Product distribution of HMF electro-oxidation over the Pt/C@NF catalyst using the (a) H-type cell with a Nafion 117 membrane, (b) H-type cell with an anion membrane, (c) H-type cell with a salt bridge, and (d) undivided cell in 0.1 M KOH and 5 mM HMF. 
For a better comparison, the product yields of HMF oxidation over the Ni@NF catalyst are also analyzed by HPLC as shown in Fig. S24.† In Fig. S24(a),† the FDCA yield over the Ni@NF is significantly lower than that over the Pt/C@NF while the FFCA yield over the Ni@NF is larger than that over the Pt/C@NF. The Ni@NF has a comparable value of HMF conversion relative to that of the Pt/C@NF. In Fig. S24(b) and (c),† when the H-type cells equipped with an anion membrane and a salt bridge are used, the HMF conversions at 120 C are lower than those obtained using the H-type cell separated by a Nafion 117 membrane and the undivided cell (shown in Fig. S24(d)†), which is consistent with the result obtained over the Pt/C@NF. It is worth noting that the NF support in the Ni@NF catalyst is also subjected to serious oxidation when the undivided cell or the H-type cell with a salt bridge is used. Similar to that of Pt/C@NF, the HMF oxidation products are not detected in the cathode cell of the H-type cells, but HMF is detected in the cathode cell of the H-type cell with an anion membrane as shown in Fig. S23.†
From the above discussion, it can be seen that the H-type cell separated with a Nafion 117 membrane is more suitable for HMF electrochemical conversion. However, previous studies reported that small organic molecules could penetrate through the Nafion membranes.20 To verify this assertion, the HMF concentration in the cathode cell was monitored as shown in Fig. 6. It can be seen that when the HMF concentration in the anode cell is higher than 5 mM, HMF diffuses from the anode to the cathode, causing the HMF concentration in the cathode cell to increase with time as shown in Fig. 6. For instance, when 50 mM HMF is used, the HMF concentration in the cathode cell increases from 0.05 mM at 10 C to 0.36 mM at 120 C. In addition, high HMF concentrations in the anode cell exacerbate the HMF crossover. When HMF concentrations in the anode cell are 5, 10, 20, 40, and 50 mM, the concentrations of HMF in the cathode are 0, 0.04, 0.11, 0.23, and 0.36 mM at 120 C, respectively. However, it should be noted that no electro-oxidation product is detected in the cathode. The final HMF concentration in the cathode cell is less than 0.4 mM. In particular, when the initial HMF concentration in the anode cell does not exceed 20 mM, the HMF concentration in the cathode cell is negligible. Fig. S25† shows the representative HPLC curves over the Ni@NF in the cathode cell. The concentration of HMF in the anode cell is 10 mM.

The effects of initial HMF concentration on the catalytic conversion of HMF are also studied as shown in Fig. S26.† The HMF conversion rate decreases with increasing initial HMF concentration. When the initial HMF concentration is higher than 5 mM, DFF can be obtained, but its yield is lower than 10%. The yield of FDCA is lower than that of FFCA when the initial HMF concentration is higher than 20 mM. Fig. S27† shows the representative HPLC curves over the Ni@NF in 10 mM HMF and 0.1 M KOH solution. It can be seen that with increasing reaction time, the yield of FDCA increases while the concentration of HMF decreases.
4. Conclusions
Based on this study, the following conclusions can be made. (1) Since HMF is not stable in strong alkaline solutions, the use of electrolyte with a pH value of 14 is not appropriate to evaluate HMF conversion resulting from electrochemical reactions. (2) The support materials have limited effects on HMF oxidation and hydrogenation, but the enhanced hydrophilicity of the CF has a positive effect on HMF oxidation. (3) The presence of ppm-levels of impurities such as Fe3+, Cu2+ and Ni2+ in the electrolyte could promote HMF electro-oxidation and show limited effects on HMF hydrogenation. In particular, the presence of Cu2+ in the electrolyte significantly accelerates HMF oxidation, and the current density increases with increasing Cu2+ concentration. (4) When NF was used as a catalyst support, the H-type cell with a salt bridge and the undivided cell are not suitable for HMF electro-oxidation, which leads to cracking of the NF. HMF was detected in the cathode cell of the H-type cell with an anion membrane. When the HMF concentration in the electrolyte is less than 20 mM, the H-type cell with a Nafion 117 membrane is more suitable for HMF conversion. This study affords a rigorous assessment protocol for evaluating the electrochemical conversion of HMF for the first time. Hopefully, it could provide valuable guidance for further research on HMF electrochemical conversion.
