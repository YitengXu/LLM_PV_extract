1. Introduction
Electrical power is most often generated at power stations by electromechanical generators through chemical combustion or nuclear fission, geothermal power and kinetic energy of flowing water. In recent years, with the surge of wireless microelectromechanical systems and nanoelectromechanical system devices, there is increasing demand for clean and efficient power generation for the self-powering of these devices from ambient energy sources, such as thermal gradient, solar, mechanical vibration, and bio-fluid. Piezoelectricity, i.e., the conversion of mechanical energy to electrical signals, is one of the most versatile phenomena to power small scale electronic devices from the device environment. In particular, the piezoelectric method for power generation from harvesting mechanical energy, such as the body movement, muscle stretching, acoustic/ultrasonic wave, etc., has attracted a great deal of attention for self-power/wireless charging, and controllability of the output power.1–6 Power generation through ambient energy harvesting has several potentials, such as in sensor network devices that observe an environment and assemble useful data about the environment.
These are employed in situations where human interactions are impossible. Hundreds, even thousands of tiny devices should be placed in some locations, such as an office building or the ocean floor, or even within a living organism, to monitor certain variables. Depending on the situations in which these networks are placed, supplying power for these devices might be an incredibly difficult task.
Piezoelectric nanogenerators are very promising and offer the possibility of performing this incredible task of supplying power for these wireless devices. Recent advances in piezoelectric nanogenerators open many doors for power generation through ambient energy harvesting for practical applications.3,7–12 The use of piezoelectric nanogenerators to capitalize on the vibrations surrounding the device is one method that has observed a dramatic increase in use for power generation. The active materials in piezoelectric nanogenerator have crystalline structures with the ability to effectively transform mechanical strain energy into electrical charges. This property gives these active materials the ability to absorb even very minute mechanical energy from their surroundings, usually ambient vibration, and transform it into electrical signals that can be used to power other devices.6,9,13 This paper discusses the recent advances in power generation through piezoelectric nanogenerators as well as the future goals that must be achieved to find their way into everyday use.
2. Importance of piezoelectric nanogenerators
In nanoscience and nanotechnology, developing a novel wireless nano-scale system, i.e. the integration of nanodevices, functional components and the power source, is of critical importance for real-time and implantable bio-sensing, environmental monitoring and portable electronics.14–16 These wireless nano-systems require their own power sources despite their small size and low power consumption. There are two ways of achieving wireless nano-systems. One is to use a battery. Even if the battery has huge capacitance, it has a limited lifetime, and miniaturization of devices limits the size of the battery, resulting in short battery lifetime. Therefore, the main challenge relies on the long-lifetime, small-sized and possibly lightweight batteries. In addition, the battery must be recharged occasionally. Consequently, the miniaturization of a power package and self-powering of these nanosystems are some key challenges for their possible applications. For biomedical applications, it is important to consider the toxicity of the materials that compose batteries. The other approach is to generate electrical power through harvesting the ambient energies.17 Energy harvesting from the ambient for powering a nanosystem is very important for its independent, wireless and sustainable operation. A piezoelectric nanogenerator is a promising approach for this application.
Energy harvesting in our living environment is a feasible approach for powering micro-/nanodevices and mobile electronics due to their small size, lower power consumption, and special working environment. Nanomaterials have unique advantages for energy conversion, including solar cells, piezoelectric nanogenerators, thermoelectric cells, etc.18,19 The type of energy harvested depends on the applications. For mobile, implantable and personal electronics, solar energy may not be the best choice because it is not available in many cases when which the devices are used. Alternatively, mechanical energy, including vibrations, air flow, and human physical motion, is available almost everywhere at all times, which is called random energy with irregular amplitudes and frequencies. Piezoelectric nanogeneration is a novel technology that has been developed for harvesting this type of energy using piezoelectric nanostructure arrays.
Nanogenerators can be used in areas that require a foldable or flexible power source, such as implanted biosensors in muscle or joints, and have the potential of directly converting biomechanical or hydraulic energy in the human body, such as flow of body fluid, blood flow, heartbeat, and contraction of the blood vessels, muscle stretching or eye blinking, into electricity to power the body-implanted devices.1,5,6,9 Heart beat-driven flexible nanogenerators can serve as ultrasensitive sensors for real-time monitoring of the human-heart behavior, which might be applied to medical diagnostics as sensors and measurement tools, and confirming the feasibility of power conversion inside a biofluid for self-powering implantable and wireless nanodevices and nanosystems in a biofluid and any other type of liquid.6 Nanogenerators convert the sound (noise or speech, and even music) that always exists in everyday life and the environment into electrical power.3 Nanogenerators would be viable candidates to meet the world's energy demands and efforts are continued not only for powering nanosystems but also for powering micro-/nano-electronic devices. Strong enough electrical power generated through nanogenerators has been used to continuously drive a commercial liquid crystal display (LCD),11 light up a commercial light-emitting diode (LED)12 and laser diode (LD)8 that confirm the feasibility of using nanogenerators for powering mobile and personal electronics.
3. Power generation behavior in piezoelectric nanogenerators
Wang and Song first introduced piezoelectric nanogeneration by examining the piezoelectric properties of a single ZnO nanowire (NW) by atomic force microscopy in 2006.19 Since then, piezoelectric semiconductor materials, such as zinc oxide (ZnO),2–20cadmium sulfide,21,22zinc sulfide (ZnS),23gallium nitride (GaN),24,25 and indium nitride,26 and piezoelectric insulator materials, such as polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF),27lead zirconate titanate (PZT),28,29 and barium titanate,7 have been used in power generation. The power generation behavior of nanogenerators fabricated with piezoelectric insulating materials depends mainly on their piezoelectric properties and produces alternating current (AC) power. The insulting properties of these materials do not permit carriers to transport from the metal electrodes of nanogenerators into these insulating active materials. As a result, AC power is produced from the nanogenerator. The corresponding positive and negative voltage, and current output peaks can be recorded when the active material is stretched and released repeatedly or the active material experiences strain, which is released repeatedly.27
The mechanism of the power generation behavior of nanogenerators fabricated from piezoelectric semiconductor materials relies on the coupled semiconducting and piezoelectric properties and is composed of two processes, which can produce AC power and direct current (DC) power. Power generation from piezoelectric semiconductor nanomaterial-based nanogenerators varies with the exerted force directions: perpendicular and parallel to the axis of the NW, and can be explained as AC and DC power generation.
3.1 AC power generation from piezoelectric semiconductor nanomaterials
AC power from a nanogenerator is due to the force exerted perpendicular to the vertically grown piezoelectric semiconducting NWs stacked between the bottom and top electrodes. A Schottky contact must be at least at one end-electrode that serves as a “gate” and prevents the flow of electrons in the external circuit through the NW so that the piezoelectric potential is preserved.3,30 The NW acts as a capacitor and a charge pump source, which drives the back and forth flow of electrons in the external circuit when vertically aligned NWs are pushed and released or lateral NWs on flexible substrates are stretched and released.3,31 The good quality effective Schottky contacts at the top and bottom electrodes are preferred for AC power generation. When piezoelectric semiconducting NWs are subjected to an external force perpendicular to NWs, a piezoelectric potential is generated along the NW owing to the relative displacement of cations with respect to anions under uniaxial strain. One side of the NW or the nanorod (NR) is subjected to a negative piezoelectric potential and the other side to a positive potential. The maximum piezoelectric potential can be calculated using the equation:32 Vmax = Fg33L/A(1)where F is the force applied to the top electrode, or the force applied in stretching the NW, g33 is the piezoelectric voltage coefficient of the NWs, L is the length of the NWs and A is the contact area of the NW. The generated negative piezoelectric potential in the NW must be sufficient to drive the piezoelectric induced electrons from the top electrode to the bottom electrode through an external circuit. Fig. 1 shows the proposed typical AC power generation mechanism. Under uniaxial strain, piezopotential-driven electrons flow from the electrode contacting the piezoelectric semiconductor NRs or NWs with the negative potential side to the opposite electrode contacting the piezoelectric semiconductor NRs or NWs with positive potential through the external circuit, and accumulated at the interface with a positive potential side. As the external force is removed, the piezoelectric potential inside the NRs or NWs disappears and accumulated electrons flow back via an external circuit.30 Consequently, an AC voltage and current pulses are recorded by the pushing force or stretching is removed or released.30,31

(b) Electrons flow from the top electrode contacting NRs with a negative potential side to the bottom electrode contacting the NRs with positive potential through the external circuit under a compressive force. (c) The piezopotential-induced electrons are then moved via the external circuit and accumulate at the interface between the bottom electrode and NRs with positive potential side. (d) As the external force is removed, the piezoelectric potential inside the NRs disappears and the accumulated electrons flow back via an external circuit.

3.2 DC power generation from piezoelectric semiconductor nanomaterials
DC power from the nanogenerator is attributed to the force exerted perpendicular to the axis of the semiconducting NW; as a result, the NW bends laterally.2,19 When a NW is subjected to an external force by the moving tip, deformation occurs throughout the NW, a piezoelectric potential is generated along the width of NW owing to the relative displacement of the cations with respect to anions. The stretched part with the positive strain will exhibit a positive electrical potential, whereas the compressed part with the negative strain will show a negative electrical potential. As a result, the tip of the NW will have an electrical potential distribution on its surface, whereas the bottom of the NW is neutralized because it is grounded. The maximum voltage generated in the NW can be calculated using the following equation,33,34 (2)where κ0 is the permittivity in a vacuum, κ is the dielectric constant, e33, e15 and e31 are the piezoelectric coefficients, ν is the Poisson ratio, a is the radius of the NW, l is the length of the NW and νmax is the maximum deflection of the NW's tip.
The electrical contact plays an important role in pumping out charges on the surface of the tips. The effective Schottky contact must be formed between the counter electrode and the tip of the NW because the ohmic contact will neutralize the electrical field generated at the tips. Owing to formation of the Schottky contact, the electrons will pass to the counter electrode from the surface of the tip when the counter electrode is in contact with the region of the negative potential and the current will be measured, whereas no current will be generated when it is in contact with the regions of a positive potential, resulting in the generation of the DC output.2
Wang et al. reported the first ZnO NW-based DC power nanogenerator based on this principle that was driven by an ultrasonic wave.2 They used zigzag trenches as the top electrode to replace the atomic force microscopy (AFM) tip. When it is subjected to the excitation of an ultrasonic wave, the zigzag electrode can move down and push the NW. This leads to lateral bending, which creates a strain field across the NW's width. Hence, the NW's outer surface is in tensile strain and its inner surface in compressive strain. When the electrode contacts the NW's stretched surface, which has a positive piezoelectric potential, the platinum (Pt) metal–ZnO semiconductor interface is a reversely biased Schottky diode, resulting in little current flowing across the interface (Fig. 2b). This process creates, separates, preserves and accumulates charges. After further pushing the electrode, the bent NW will reach the other side of the zigzag electrode's adjacent tooth. In such a case, the electrode is also in contact with the compressed side of the NWs, where the metal–semiconductor interface is a forward-biased Schottky barrier, resulting in a sudden increase in the output electric current flowing from the top electrode into the NW. This is the discharge process. This design works provided there is a relative displacement between the electrode and NWs. Recently, our group reported the AC and DC mode control by integrating nanogenerators with vertical and tilted NRs.30 DC power could be generated through the nanogenerator with a graphene electrode-based ZnO NWs–nanowall hybrid structure with a top gold (Au) electrode.36

4. Designs and fabrication
To eliminate the use of the AFM tip as reported in the first nanogenerator for independent operation and technological applications, there have been various innovation designs for improving the performance and applicability of the nanogenerators. The first independent operation of a nanogenerator was also realized by Wang et al. through the design of a nanogenerator with zigzag trenches as a top electrode to replace the AFM tip, where zigzag trenches act as an array of aligned AFM tips2 (Fig. 2). This was the DC power nanogenerator and was demonstrated for an ultrasonic wave with a frequency of 41 kHz. This work formed the basic platform for optimizing and improving the performance of the nanogenerators by integrating them into layered structures. Since then, several vertical NWs-integrated nanogenerators and lateral NWs-integrated nanogenerators were fabricated by integrating them into layered structures to improve their performance.5,31,37,38 In addition, there have been continuing efforts to improve the design and fabrication of nanogenerators for several technological applications with better performance.
Flexible nanogenerators
A nanogenerator that is capable of harvesting biomechanical energy needs to be operated at low frequencies (<10 Hz). The substrate used for building such nanogenerators has to be flexible and foldable so that it can respond to the low frequency excitation. Flexible nanogenerators are useful in areas that require a foldable or flexible power source, such as implanted biosensors in the muscle or joint, and have the potential of directly converting biomechanical or hydraulic energy in the human body, such as flow of body fluid, blood flow, heartbeat, and contraction of blood vessels, muscle stretching or eye blinking, into electricity to power body-implanted devices. To meet the requirements, Wang et al. fabricated nanogenerators using a fiber as a substrate, onto which piezoelectric ZnO NWs were grown radially around the textile fiber.20 The design is based on two inter-twisted fibers that form a pair of “teeth–teeth brushes”, with one fiber covered with Au coated NWs and the other just with bare NWs (Fig. 3). The relative brushing of the NWs rooted at the two fibers produces electricity via a coupled piezoelectric semiconductor process. This was the first demonstration of a fiber-based nanogenerator.

Although the output performance from the fiber-based nanogenerator was low, this study established the fundamental methodology for scavenging the body movement energy using fabric-based nanomaterials. In addition, to improve the output performance and applicability of the flexible nanogenerators, it is important to detect simultaneously all forces, pressures and vibrations in electromechanical systems. In particular, flexibility and transparency are significant for artificial skins or touch sensor applications, such as full touch screens and deformable displays. Therefore, our group reported an integrated transparent flexible nanogenerator with piezoelectric ZnO NRs that is suitable for use as a transparent flexible self-powered pressure sensor, which was driven by a mechanical force.32,39Fig. 4 shows a schematic diagram of an integrated transparent flexible nanogenerator with piezoelectric ZnO NRs and a field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) image of ZnO-NR arrays grown on a flexible indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated polyether sulfone (PES) substrate. The top electrode was placed above the ZnO NR arrays. The integrated device was then sealed at the edges to prevent physical and chemical damage. Since the ZnO NRs and top electrode can be fabricated on flexible substrates, it is possible for the integrated nanodevice to be fully flexible. Furthermore, the device can be transparent, depending on the materials of the top electrode because controlled ZnO-NR arrays are transparent (over 90%). This device can generate a current via the deformation of piezoelectric ZnO NRs by external mechanical forces. This transparent flexible nanogenerator device produces a direct current due to the flexibility of the top and a bottom electrode, vertical compressive force bends NRs, and a piezoelectric potential is generated along the width of the NRs in lateral bending, as shown in Fig. 5. The measured output current density from this nanogenerator was approximately 3.7 μA cm−2 under a compressive force of 0.9 kgf. The compressive force of 0.9 kgf could not fracture the NRs, which confirms that transparent flexible piezoelectric nanodevices can act as a reliable nanosystem for applications, such as touch sensors and artificial skin.

Fully rollable transparent nanogenerator
Transparent metallic or metal oxide films used for transparent conductors have limited use in flexible electronics due to their mechanical brittleness, chemical instability and high cost (they often include noble or rare metals).40,41 Transparent flexible nanogenerators designed using these metallic or metal oxide film electrodes, such as ITO, have limited flexibility due to the ceramic structure of the ITO, and defects can be introduced easily if the device is overflexed.42,43 Two-dimensional (2D) graphene sheets with extraordinary electrical and mechanical properties have extremely high mobility (as high as 26000 cm2 V−1s−1) at room temperature44 and high mechanical elasticity (elastic modulus of approximately 1 TPa)45 based on carbon–carbon covalent bonds, which are favorable for unique applications in the fields of nanoelectronics. Therefore, a fully rollable transparent piezoelectric nanogenerator was realized using chemical vapor deposition (CVD)-grown large-scale graphene sheets as transparent electrodes in the previous work.46Fig. 6 presents a schematic diagram of an integrated fully rollable piezoelectric nanogenerator. To complete the integrated graphene-based nanogenerator, a heterogeneous 3D nanostructure consisting of 1D ZnO NRs on a 2D graphene electrode was first prepared. A graphene-based nanogenerator was completed by integrating the 3D heterogeneous nanostructure with another graphene sheet as a top electrode, as shown in Fig. 6d.

Reproduced with the permission of ref. 46. 
The current was measured from the graphene-based nanogenerator by applying the pushing force (1 kgf) to the top of the nanogenerator in the vertical direction. Fig. 7 shows the current density generated by the graphene-based nanogenerators. The output current density was approximately 2 mA cm−2. Despite the high sheet resistance of the graphene top electrode (∼200 Ω, which is much larger than that of the commercially available ITO on plastic substrates, 60–80 Ω), the output currents were detected clearly. Moreover, the output current peaks were sharp and narrow. “Switching-polarity” tests and “linear superposition” tests were performed to confirm that the measured signal was generated by the graphene-based nanogenerators rather than the measurement system. When the current meter was forward connected to a graphene-based nanogenerator, a positive current pulse was recorded during pushing (before 50 s in Fig. 7a). The current pulses were also reversed when the current meter was reverse connected (after 50 s in Fig. 7a). The output current density for both connecting conditions was similar. In the linear superposition tests, the output current of the nanogenerators was enhanced by connecting them in parallel. The output current was approximately the sum of the output currents of the individual nanogenerators. The current output level could be improved by increasing the work function and reducing the resistance of the graphene electrodesvia the controlled doping process.47

In this study, it was observed that many line defects were visible to the human eye on the ITO electrodes after rolling ITO-based nanogenerators on an 8 mm diameter pen. On the other hand, defects were not visible on the graphene-based nanogenerators after rolling on the same pen. In particular, there were no differences in the output current measured from the graphene-based nanogenerator before and after the device had been rolled several times on the pen (Fig. 7b). A stable and reliable output current was due to the mechanical and structural strength of the graphene-based nanogenerators and the electrical stability of the graphene sheet. The authors examined the in situ electrical stability of the transferred graphene sheet of 75% transmittance at a wavelength of 550 nm under mechanical bending. The two-probe resistance of the graphene sheets after bending was recovered perfectly. The stable electrical characteristic of a graphene electrode under the bending tests was attributed to the high mechanical strength and thin thickness of the graphene electrode.41,48–50 Therefore, this work highlights the tremendous potential for the use of graphene sheets as fully rollable transparent electrodes in various flexible electronics. The authors analyzed the stress distributions for the graphene-based nanogenerator via simulation to clearly understand the mechanical and structural stabilities of graphene-based nanogenerators under rolling.
Sound-driven nanogenerator
The sound (noise, speech or music) always exists in everyday life and the environment has been overlooked as a source for piezoelectric power generation despite the fact that it is a form of mechanical energy. There should be a way to convert sound energy from speech, music or noise into electrical power, so that sound can be used for various novel applications including mobile phones that can be charged during conversations and sound-insulating walls near highways that generate electricity from the sound of passing vehicles. This development would have the additional benefit of reducing the noise levels near highways by absorbing the sound energy of vehicles. Fig. 8a and b shows a schematic diagram of an integrated sound driven nanogenerator with piezoelectric ZnO NWs and a cross-sectional FE-SEM image of vertically well-aligned ZnO NW arrays (acting as a piezoelectric active layer), respectively.3 The NWs were grown by thermal CVDvia a vapor–liquid–solid mechanism on an n-type GaN thin film (acting as a bottom electrode)-deposited sapphire substrate. A PdAu-coated PES substrate was used as both the top electrode and vibration plate and was placed above the ZnO NW arrays. The integrated device was then sealed at the edges to prevent physical and chemical damage. The mean length and diameter of the ZnO NWs were approximately 10 μm and 150 nm, respectively. The integrated nanogenerator was then connected to a measurement system.

(c) The input signal for the generation of a sound wave and the output voltage generated from the sound-driven nanogenerator. Reproduced with the permission of ref. 3. 

Fig. 8c shows the output voltage obtained from the integrated nanogenerator in response to the input signal of the sound wave. The converted electrical energy from the sound wave was displayed on the oscilloscope as a voltage in AC mode, according to the frequency of the sound wave with the sinusoidal mode electrical input with a small phase difference. This phase difference between signals was attributed to the impedance of the intrinsic capacitance and reactance within the piezoelectric circuit. The intensity of the input sound was 100 decibels (dB) (10−2Wm−2 at 100 Hz), and the amplitude of the output voltage was approximately 50 mV. The AC voltage was measured as a result of sound wave directly transferred to the vertically aligned ZnO NWs, causing the compressing and release of the NWs. In this work, the authors examined the voltage generation behavior with the change in sound wave intensity and frequency. In the linear superposition test, the output voltages of the nanogenerators were enhanced by connecting them in series.
1.6 V nanogenerator for mechanical energy harvesting using PZT nanofibers

          PZT is a widely used piezoelectric ceramic material with high piezoelectric voltage and dielectric constants, which are the ideal properties of active materials for mechanical to electrical energy conversion. The piezoelectric voltage constant of the semiconducting piezoelectric NWs in the recently reported piezoelectric nanogenerators was lower than that of PZT nanomaterials, as a result of the lower voltage generation from semiconducting piezoelectric NWs-based nanogenerator. There have been several successful demonstrations of nanogenerators, output voltage and power still further to improve for practical applications. To generate a high output voltage up to 1.6 V, Chen et al. reported the fabrication of a nanogenerator for mechanical energy harvesting using PZT nanofibers.28 A highly efficient nanogenerator based on laterally aligned PZT nanofibers on interdigitated electrodes was fabricated. The nanogenerator device was fabricated by the deposition of PZT nanofibers that had been prepared by electrospinning on the interdigitated electrodes of Pt fine wire (diameter of 50 μm) arrays, which were assembled on a Si substrate (Fig. 9a). The diameters of the PZT nanofibers were controlled to be approximately 60 nm (Fig. 9b) by varying the concentration of poly vinyl pyrrolidone in the modified sol–gel solution. The PZT nanofibers were continuous, whereas the distance between the two adjacent electrodes was 500 μm, as designed. A pure perovskite phase was obtained by annealing at 650 °C for approximately 25 min. Subsequently, a soft polymer (polydimethylsiloxane, PDMS) was applied to the top of the PZT nanofibers (Fig. 9c). The interdigitated electrodes of fine Pt wires were connected by extraction electrodes to transport the harvested electrons to an external circuit. Finally, PZT nanofibers were polled by applying an electric field of 4 × 106 V m−1 across the electrodes (Fig. 9d) at a temperature >140 °C for approximately 24 h. The nanogenerator can be released from the Si substrate or prepared on flexible substrates.

Fig. 9d and e shows the nanogenerator device and power generation mechanism, in which PZT nanofibers were working in longitudinal mode with an alternating pressure applied to the top surface of the nanogenerator. The applied pressure was transferred to the PZT nanofibers. The measured output voltage and power under periodic stress application to the soft polymer were 1.63 V and 0.03 μW, respectively. The output voltage from the PZT nanofiber generator was measured when it underwent an impulsive load, which was applied by tapping the top of the generator with a small Teflon stack. As shown in Fig. 10a, the generated voltage, which was induced by piezopotential-driven transient flow of electrons under an external load, reached 600 mV when a larger impact was applied to the nanogenerator by periodic knocking. The output voltage generated by the device increased with increasing impact energy applied to the surface. A damping effect of the soft polymer matrix on the resonant frequency was also observed during the energy harvesting process. In the second application, fingers were used to apply a periodic dynamic load to the top of the nanogenerator, in which the positive and negative voltage outputs were observed (Fig. 10b). A negative voltage distribution was generated due to the reverse-flowing carriers when the external load was removed and the piezopotential vanished. The highest output voltage recorded during the test was 1.63 V. The amplitudes of the voltage outputs depended on how much pressure had been applied to the nanogenerator surface.

Flexible high-output nanogenerator based on lateral ZnO NW arrays
In the case of insulating piezoelectric materials, such as PVDF and PZT, the reported output voltage was up to 1.6 V and the output power was 0.03 μW.28 The realization of self-powered efficient devices with higher output power is still a critical challenge. Zhu et al. reported the fabrication of flexible high output nanogenerators with a further improved output voltage up to 2.03 V and a peak power density of 11 mW cm−3. Furthermore, they predicted that a peak output power density of ∼0.44 mW cm−2,12 and volume density of 1.1 W cm−3 could be achieved by optimizing the density of the NWs on the substrate and using multilayer integration. The generated electric energy was effectively stored using capacitors, and it was used successfully to light up a commercial LED, which is a landmark progress toward building self-powered devices by harvesting the energy from the environment. The authors used an effective approach, named the scalable sweeping-printing-method, to fabricate flexible nanogenerators with high efficiency. This method consists of two main steps. In the first step, the vertically aligned NWs were transferred to a receiving substrate to form horizontally aligned arrays. The major components of the transfer setup can be divided into two stages (Fig. 11a). Stage 1 has a flat surface that faces downward and holds the vertically aligned NWs. Stage 2 has a curved surface and holds the receiving substrate. The PDMS film on the surface of stage 2 is used as a cushion layer to support the receiving substrate and enhances the alignment of the transferred NWs. The radius of the curved surface of stage 2 equals the length of the rod supporting the stage, which is free to move in circular motion. In the second step, electrodes are deposited to connect all the NWs together. Fig. 11 gives an illustration of the fabrication process and structure characterization of the nanogenerator.

The working principle of the nanogenerator is illustrated by the schematic diagrams in Fig. 12a and b. The NWs connected in parallel contribute collectively to the current output; NWs in different rows connected in series improve the voltage output constructively. The same growth direction of all NWs and the sweeping printing method ensure that the crystallographic orientations of the horizontal NWs are aligned along the sweeping direction. Consequently, the polarity of the induced piezopotential is also aligned, leading to a macroscopic potential contributed constructively by all the NWs (Fig. 12b). To examine the performance of the highly efficient output nanogenerator, a linear motor was used to periodically deform the nanogenerator in a cyclic stretching-releasing agitation (0.33 Hz). The open-circuit voltage and short-circuit current were measured with caution to exclude possible artifacts. At a strain of 0.1% and a strain rate of 5% s−1, the peak voltage and current reached up to 2.03 V and 107 nA, respectively.

Nanogenerator fabricated with lateral ZnO NWs array produced higher voltage as compared to nanogenerator fabricated with PZT nanofibers. It is due to the same growth direction of ZnO NWs guarantee the alignment of the piezoelectric potentials in all the NWs and successful scaling up of the output. On the other hand, PZT nanofibers are not perfectly aligned and scaling up of the output is not as strong as in ZnO NWs.
5. The important factors that affect the performance of a nanogenerator

          Carrier density
The carrier density of the semiconductor piezoelectric nanomaterials is one of the important factors that affect the performance of a nanogenerator. Liu et al. found that a higher carrier density increases the rate at which the piezoelectric charges are screened/neutralized but a very low carrier density prevents the flow of current through the NWs and increases the inner resistance of the NWs.51–53 The carrier density needs to be high enough to transport the current under the driving of the piezoelectric potential in the charge releasing process. Therefore, there should be an optimum conductance of the NW to maximize the output of the NG. They demonstrated a series of experiments to tune the carrier density with ultraviolet (UV) light irradiation on the nanogenerator and observed it. Fig. 13 shows the output demonstration of a nanogenerator, as excited by an ultrasonic wave when the UV light is turned on and off. This confirms that a large number of carriers screen the piezoelectric potential and reduce the output of the nanogenerator. UV light reduces the output current by 30–45%, indicating that an increase in carrier density is not beneficial for improving the output power.

Schottky contact
The mechanism of the nanogenerator is based on two important physical quantities. One is the optimum conductivity and carrier density of the piezoelectric semiconductor NW in the first step to prevent neutralization of the piezoelectric potential distribution. The second is the height of the Schottky barrier, which needs to be high enough to hold the charges from leaking. Schottky contact between the metal contact and piezoelectric semiconductor NW is a key factor to the current generation process. Examining how it affects the performance of nanogenerator will provide effective guidance in designing and fabricating high output nanogenerators. Liu et al. characterized the current–voltage (I–V) characteristics of a set of nanogenerators to illustrate the effects of the Schottky barrier for current generation.51Fig. 14a shows the I–V characteristics of a nanogenerator that did generate an output current (top inset of Fig. 14a). The experimental setup for the measurement is shown in the inset at the lower right corner in Fig. 14a.

I–V characteristics of an assembled NG to identify its performance for producing current. (a) For a nanogenerator that actively generates current, as shown in the inset, its I–V curve when the ultrasonic wave was off clearly shows Schottky diode behavior. UV light not only increased the carrier density (or conductivity) but also might reduce the barrier height. (b) For a “defective” nanogenerator that did not produce a current, the I–V curve shows ohmic behavior. Reproduced with the permission of ref. 51. 

          Electrodes conductivity
In addition to the fact that output power varies with the crystalline quality, length and contact area of the NWs,54 the electrical conductivity of the electrodes used to integrate the nanogenerator also plays a major role in enhancing the power generation from the nanogenerators. Our group reported that the use of lower sheet resistance electrodes contributes to a higher output current. The higher conductivity of the electrodes ensures that a larger number of electrons contribute to the output current in an external circuit. Shin et al. reported the modulation of current generation by varying the sheet resistance of graphene,47 as shown in Fig. 15.

6. Further discussion
There are several successful demonstrations on nanogenerators as summarized in Table 1. There is still scope for the further improvement in the output performance through scientific findings, such as neutralization of piezoelectric potential screening effect due to the free carriers into semiconductor NWs, optimization and localization of free carriers in NWs, which affect any piezoelectric signals. Alexe et al.55 discussed in their work that a high intrinsic conductivity of the piezoelectric material itself is detrimental to the detection of any piezoelectric signal. They argued that charge generated by piezoelectric effect will be cancelled due to high electron mobility (∼100 cm2 V−1s−1) and high free carrier concentration (∼1018 cm−3) in the ZnO NWs. Therefore, the detection of piezoelectric signals becomes a difficult task.

Wang replied in many aspects of his correspondence article56 and concluded that Alexe et al. used a measurement system of possible artifacts such as huge noise level, interference from the environment and instantaneous system errors during the measurement. Consequently, their measurement system could not detect piezoelectric signals. He predicted and verified with the experiment that conductivity and free carriers can screen the piezoelectric charge but they cannot totally cancel out the piezoelectric charges, which means that magnitude of the piezoelectric potential will be reduced by the free carriers.
Previous experimental results and findings support Wang's claim. “Switching-polarity” test in research works confirms and verifies that the measured signals were from NWs based nanogenerators rather than the measurement system. His argument is “free carriers can screen the piezoelectric charge but they cannot totally cancel out the piezoelectric charges”. It could be due to atomic density of ZnO of the order of about 1022 cm−3 which are much larger than intrinsic free carriers density of about 1017 cm−3. Hence, although magnitude of the piezoelectric potential is reduced by the free carriers, it is hard to support that charge generated by piezoelectric effect in the ZnO NW is fully cancelled out by the free carriers. These were very useful arguments with the detailed discussion from Alexe et al. and Wang to enhance the scientific and technical understanding of nanogenerators.
Concluding remarks
The importance of nanogenerators and the recent advances in power generation through nanogenerators was reviewed along with the power generation mechanism. Recent advances in piezoelectric nanogenerators open many doors for power generation through ambient energy harvesting for practical real world applications. Piezoelectric nanogenerators are promising for the miniaturization of a power package and the self-powering of nano-systems used in implantable bio-sensing, environmental monitoring and personal electronics. In particular, flexible and foldable nanogenerators are useful in areas that require a foldable or flexible power source, such as implanted biosensors in the muscle or joint, and have the potential of directly converting biomechanical or hydraulic energy in the human body, such as flow of body fluid, blood flow, heartbeat, and contraction of blood vessels, muscle stretching or eye blinking, into electricity to power implanted bio-devices. Sound-driven nanogenerator converts sound energy from speech, music or noise into electrical power for novel applications including mobile phones that can be charged during conversations. Considerable research and engineering efforts are being made to enhance power generation through nanogenerators to commercialize its applications not only in nano-systems, but also to power microelectronic devices. There have been successful demonstrations that strong enough electrical power generated through nanogenerators can continuously drive a commercial LCD, light up a commercial LED and LD, which confirm the feasibility of using nanogenerators for powering mobile and personal microelectronics. More effort will be needed to fabricate integrated amplifier with power generators to amplify the output power to meet the world's energy demand. There should be efforts in harvesting multiplex energy through the nanogenerators for efficient electricity generation. In addition, more study will be needed for DC power generation through nanogenerators and enhancing their output for the miniaturization of a power package.

 	Fig. 14  
I–V characteristics of an assembled NG to identify its performance for producing current. (a) For a nanogenerator that actively generates current, as shown in the inset, its I–V curve when the ultrasonic wave was off clearly shows Schottky diode behavior. UV light not only increased the carrier density (or conductivity) but also might reduce the barrier height. (b) For a “defective” nanogenerator that did not produce a current, the I–V curve shows ohmic behavior. Reproduced with the permission of ref. 51.
