    , Accepted 10th February 2022First published on 12th February 2022AbstractAqueous organic flow batteries (AOFBs) hold great promise for large-scale energy-storage applications because of their high theoretical specific capacity, use of only earth-abundant elements, ease of large-scale manufacturing and environmental sustainability of the organic redox-active electrolyte materials. Numerous organic molecules/polymers have been explored as redox-active electrolyte materials for AOFBs. However, their low solubility in aqueous solution greatly restricts their practical application. Herein, highly efficient single-molecule redox-targeting (SMRT) reactions between a solid organic-based energy-storage material (tribenzo[a,c,i]phenazine-10,15-dione, TBPDO) and two water-soluble redox shuttle molecules (anthrafravic acid and lawsone) driven by Nernstian potential are adopted to effectively circumvent the solubility limit in aqueous electrolytes, thus increasing the energy density of AOFBs. The aqueous organic redox-targeting flow battery (RTFB) employing TBPDO as an anodic capacity booster demonstrates a considerably enhanced volumetric capacity (energy density) and high material utilization (80.2%) as well as an outstanding capacity retention of 99.82% per cycle (∼98.56% per day) with high energy efficiency (80.7%) during long-term charge–discharge cycling.
Introduction
Flow batteries stand out as one of the most promising electrochemical systems for large-scale stationary energy storage, and are used to minimize the effects of the intermittency and variability of renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power due to their many advantages, including decoupling the relationship between energy storage and power generation, high scalability, low cost and superior safety over conventional rechargeable batteries.1–3
As the most mature flow battery system currently, the vanadium flow battery has attracted the most interest in commercial applications owing to the elimination of the cross-contamination of redox-active species by employing the same element on both sides.4–6 However, the scarcity of vanadium and the low water solubility of the cathodic VO2+/VO2+ couple as well as the use of highly corrosive acidic electrolyte limit its widespread deployment.1,7,8 As attractive alternatives, electro-active organic compounds/polymers consisting of earth-abundant elements exhibit fast redox reactions and have exceptional structural and property tunability,9–11 which have made them a promising direction for the design of low-cost and high-performance flow batteries.12
Since the first reports of 4,5-dihydroxy-1,3-benzenedisulfonic acid (tiron)13 as a catholyte material for aqueous Pb//tiron flow batteries and the subsequent development and utilization of anthraquinone-based anolyte materials,14,15 aqueous organic flow batteries employing electro-active organic materials have quickly attracted a large amount of attention. Through functionalization, molecular engineering, theoretical screening or a combination of these, various organic compounds/polymers containing redox-active core motifs (e.g. quinone, alloxazine, phenazine, viologen, nitroxyl radical, and ferrocene16–21) have been developed for aqueous organic flow battery applications. Among these, quinone and phenazine derivatives stand out due to their rapid electrochemical kinetics, superior stability, low toxicity and potentially low cost. However, the aqueous solubility of these substances is usually pH-dependent and the concentration can rarely reach higher than 1 M in flow battery applications. Although hydrophilic additives can effectively increase the solubility of certain redox-active organic electrolyte materials by forming strong non-covalent interactions22,23 and thus improving the volumetric capacity and energy density, it is usually at the cost of sharply increased viscosity, leading to low accessible capacity.
As a solution to break through the concentration limit of liquid electrolytes in conventional flow batteries, Wang's group developed recently a novel electrochemical hybrid energy-storage system, where liquid redox electrolytes were used as efficient mediators to charge/discharge solid-state electro-active materials by what is called redox-targeting reactions.24–27 In this redox-targeting flow battery (RTFB), besides storing electrons, liquid electrolytes can shuttle electrons from the redox centres of electro-active solids to the electrode for energy storage with the help of their own reversible redox reactions. Therefore, the energy density of an RTFB mainly depends on the capacity of the loaded solid rather than the concentration of the liquid electrolyte, since the effective concentration of redox species in solid energy-storage materials is much greater than that in liquid electrolytes.
So far, the solid-state energy-storage materials for RTFBs are either inorganic species (e.g. LiFePO4, Fe4[Fe(CN)6]3, and (VO)6[Fe(CN)6]3 (ref. 24–28)) reported previously in conventional metal-ion batteries or redox-active organic polymers, such as polyaniline,29 polyimide,30 and viologen-based polymer.31 However, it is much more difficult to tune the redox potential and reaction kinetics to meet the matching requirements of redox-targeting reactions for inorganic electro-active materials compared with their organic counterparts, though they are generally commercially available or can be obtained via a facile synthesis approach.24,25 Also, organic polymers are susceptible to chemical and/or physical degradation, particularly by the action of water and oxygen, incurring a loss of redox activity during charge–discharge cycling.29,32 Redox-active conjugated organic compounds whose electrochemical activity derives from the reversible structural reorganization of redox-active subunits promoted by a π-conjugated structure14,33 possess excellent structural stability due to their large planar π-conjugate structures,33,34 which have not been explored yet as an energy-storage material in RTFB systems. In this work, we report for the first time a solid-state organic energy-storage material (tribenzo[a,c,i]phenazine-10,15-dione, TBPDO) containing two different redox-active subunits (i.e. quinone and pyrazine) that can react selectively with two redox mediator molecules (lawsone and anthrafravic acid) in the aqueous phase to realize the high-density storage of electric energy in flow battery applications. TBPDO undergoes reversible four-electron transfer reactions in alkaline aqueous solution, thus providing a high theoretical specific capacity of 298 mA h g−1. Benefiting from the highly efficient single-molecule redox-targeting (SMRT) reactions between TBPDO and two organic-based redox shuttles driven by the Nernstian potential, the aqueous RTFB employing TBPDO as a capacity booster exhibited a significantly enhanced volumetric capacity (energy density) and high material utilization (80.2%) as well as an outstanding capacity retention of 99.82% per cycle (∼98.56% per day) with a high energy efficiency (80.7%) during charge–discharge cycling.
Results and discussion
A π-conjugated heterocyclic compound, TBPDO, was synthesized via a straightforward two-step reaction with an overall yield of ∼70% (Scheme 1). First, 2,3-diamino-1,4-naphthoquinone (DANQ) was obtained from 2,3-dichloro-1,4-naphthoquinone by a classical Gabriel amine synthesis.35 A facile procedure for the conversion of two aromatic amino groups into cyclic pyrazine was then performed to yield heteroaromatic TBPDO. The successful syntheses of DANQ and TBPDO with high yields were confirmed by 1H NMR and FT-IR experiments, as described in Fig. S1–S3.†
 Scheme 1  Synthetic routes for TBPDO. 
As shown in Fig. 1, the CV curves of TBPDO in 1 M KOH solution at different scan rates displayed two pairs of reversible redox waves with small peak separation values (ΔEp1 ∼8 mV at 10 mV s−1 for ET1 and ΔEp2 ∼21 mV at 10 mV s−1 for ET2, respectively). The standard potential for ET1 (E10) was calculated to be −0.714 V, while the standard potential for ET2 (E20) was −0.536 V. The peak currents increased linearly with the increase in the scan rates (v) (insets of Fig. 1), indicating the surface-controlled redox kinetics for both ET1 and ET2 reactions. Furthermore, a slight decrease (3.7%) in peak current was observed in 1 M KOH after repeating 100 CV cycles (Fig. S4†), suggesting the high redox stability of TBPDO. A semi-infinite linear diffusion Cottrell equation was utilized to measure the diffusion coefficients (D) for both ET1 and ET2 since these redox reactions of the TBPDO electrode were governed by diffusion rather than surface adsorption at high scan rates (Fig. S5 and S6†) and there was found a good linear dependence of j versus t−1/2 (Fig. S7†).36 The average D values were determined to be 2.33 × 10−12 cm2 s−1 for ET1 and 6.97 × 10−13 cm2 s−1 for ET2, respectively. Next, the charge-transfer rate constant (k0) was determined from the slope of the Ψ ∼ ν−1/2 dependence (Fig. S8†) using Nicholson's method,37 which was 8.21 × 10−4 cm s−1 for ET1 and 1.59 × 10−3 cm s−1 for ET2, respectively. These electrochemical kinetic parameters for TBPDO are summarized in Table 1.

The CV curves of the TBPDO electrode in KOH solutions of various concentrations are shown in Fig. 2a, from which Pourbaix diagrams (E0–pH, Fig. 2b) were plotted for ET1 and ET2, respectively. The slopes of the Pourbaix diagram of ET1 and ET2 on the TBPDO electrode were observed to be 26.6 and 28.2 mV pH−1, respectively, revealing typical two-electron one-proton process for both ET1 and ET2 reactions (Fig. 2c).38

To facilitate the SMRT reaction kinetics and reduce the voltage loss, we screened water-soluble redox molecules based on the requirements of SMRT for potential matching and a similarity of the molecular structure. A low-potential anthraquinone derivative, anthrafravic acid, was chosen here as a redox shuttle to target the ET1 reaction of TBPDO, which possessed a pair of reversible redox waves at −0.727 V vs. SHE in the alkaline electrolyte, rather close to that of ET1 of TBPDO (−0.714 V, Fig. 3). Moreover, a naphthoquinone derivative, lawsone, with a redox potential of −0.518 V vs. SHE, was utilized as another redox shuttle molecule to target the ET2 reaction. The difference in E0 (ΔE20) of lawsone and the ET2 reaction of TBPDO was found to be 18 mV.
 Fig. 3  CVs of anthrafravic acid (5 mM, blue), lawsone (5 mM, red) and TBPDO (black) in 1 M KOH at a scan rate of 25 mV s−1. 
As shown in Fig. S9,† both anthrafravic acid and lawsone showed fast and reversible two-electron redox reactions in a strong base condition (1 M KOH). Interestingly, the E0 value of anthrafravic acid in the mixture of anthrafravic acid and lawsone was found to be −0.716 V, slightly more positive than that of anthrafravic acid alone (−0.727 V). The difference between this value and the E0 of ET1 (−0.714 V) was only 2 mV. Moreover, compared with that of lawsone alone (−0.518 V), a slightly more negative E0 for lawsone was observed in the mixture of anthrafravic acid and lawsone, which was −0.530 V, only 6 mV higher than the redox potential of ET2 (−0.536 V). In brief, anthrafravic acid and lawsone demonstrated excellent matching of the redox potential with TBPDO. Besides this excellent potential matching, all of them showed fast redox kinetics in alkaline aqueous electrolyte (Table 1).
TBPDO and a mixture of anthrafravic acid and lawsone were utilized as the anodic capacity booster and the anolyte, respectively, paired with a K4[Fe(CN)6]/K3[Fe(CN)6] catholyte to assemble an aqueous RTFB (Fig. S10†). Excess quantities of ferrocyanide were used in the catholyte to ensure that the anode side was the limiting factor of the capacity. The anodic redox shuttles were first cycled in the absence of the capacity booster to establish the fundamental charge–discharge profiles and to measure the accessible capacity of the anolyte alone. As shown in Fig. 4a, a discharge capacity of 20 mA h was obtained with a mixture of 50 mM anthrafravic acid and 50 mM lawsone (5 mL) at a constant current density of 2 mA cm−2, which corresponded to ∼74.6% SOC of the solution. When the current density increased to 5 mA cm−2, a discharge capacity of 26.5 mA h was measured, corresponding to a ∼98.9% SOC. After adding 1 equivalent capacity of TBPDO (90 mg, 26.8 mA h), the redox-targeting reaction between the redox shuttles and TBPDO boosted the discharge capacity to 2.08 times higher, corresponding to an 80.2% utilization of TBPDO under 2 mA cm−2 and a power-to-energy ratio of about 0.24 h−1. The volumetric capacity of the anode side was improved from ca 4.0 to 8.3 A h L−1via the redox-targeting reaction. Compared to conventional flow batteries, whose concentrations of redox-active species are generally less than 2 M, this aqueous RTFB design could bring significant enhancement in energy density because of the extremely high concentration of active redox species in the solid-state TBPDO (∼23.7 M electron transfer). Owing to the highly matched redox potentials between TBPDO and the two redox shuttle molecules and high specific capacity of TBPDO, the RTFB cell can in theory deliver an anodic tank energy density as high as 423.8 W h L−1 by taking account of the capacity of the organic-based anolyte (solubility 0.6 M for anthrafravic acid and 0.62 M for lawsone, respectively) infiltrated in the TBPDO pellets (assuming a porosity of 50%) in the tank.
 Fig. 4  (a) Voltage profiles of the RTFB cell without and with TBPDO at 2 and 5 mA cm−2, respectively. 5 mL 50 mM anthrafravic acid + 50 mM lawsone in 1 M KOH was utilized as the anolyte while 10 mL 300 mM K4[Fe(CN)6] + 75 mM K3[Fe(CN)6] in 1 M KOH was used as the catholyte. (b) Capacity retention and efficiencies of the RTFB cell after adding 26.8 mA h TBPDO at a constant current density of 5 mA cm−2. 
A discharge capacity of 39.8 mA h was achieved at 5 mA cm−2, slightly lower than that obtained at 2 mA cm−2. However, the utilization of TBPDO was found to be reduced to ∼49.3%, which may be because the kinetic rate of the redox-targeting reaction between TBPDO and two redox shuttles in aqueous phase was slower than that of the electrochemical reaction of the redox shuttles. This phenomenon may have arisen from one or more of the following causes. First, TBPDO was directly utilized as the energy-storage material instead of a composite with carbon black as reported in previous work for aqueous organic RTFB.29,30 It is known that the carbon black network in the composites may enable the redox shuttles to react instantly at the surface of energy-storage materials rather than diffusing into the bulk before reacting.29 Second, the low specific surface area of TBPDO (BET surface area ∼25 m2 g−1) results in large liquid-phase diffusion resistance for the redox-targeting reaction. Finally, the sluggish redox-targeting reaction may also be attributed to the insufficient hydrophilicity for TBPDO and its reduced species. The contact angle of water on the surface of TBPDO was found to be ∼88°, indicating a relatively poor wettability (Fig. S11†). Therefore, the kinetics of the redox-targeting reaction is expected to be promoted by compositing with porous carbon materials or synthesizing TBPDO with a high specific surface area or granulating with a hydrophilic binder (e.g. methyl cellulose39). In addition, when 2 equivalent capacity of TBPDO (180 mg, 53.6 mA h) was added, a discharge capacity of 52.6 mA h (equivalent to ∼10.3 A h L−1) was achieved at 5 mA cm−2, corresponding to a 48.5% utilization of TBPDO (Fig. S12†).
As shown in Fig. 4b and S13,† the RTFB cell with 26.8 mA h TBPDO retained 96.22% of the initial discharge capacity after 21 charging–discharge cycles at 5 mA cm−2, projecting a capacity retention rate of 99.82% per cycle or a temporal capacity retention rate of ∼98.56% per day, demonstrating excellent cycling stability. Moreover, the cell has a high average voltage efficiency of 84.96% during the charging–discharge cycling, attributable to a highly efficient SMRT reaction between two redox shuttles and TBPDO. The average coulombic efficiency and round-trip energy efficiency were 94.96% and 80.68%, respectively. Furthermore, a charging–discharge cycling test for the RTFB cell with 53.6 mA h TBPDO was conducted at 5 mA cm−2 (Fig. S14†). After 12 cycles, the discharge capacity decreased slightly from 53.5 to 50.9 mA h. The cell with 53.6 mA h TBPDO exhibited a capacity retention rate of ∼99.61% per cycle with a coulombic efficiency and energy efficiency of 96.58% and 86.50%, respectively.
Table S2† provides a performance comparison of the capacity, material utilization, efficiency, and cycling stability of the TBPDO-based RTFB and some representative aqueous organic RTFBs reported so far.29,30,39 This RTFB with TBPDO possessed a highest theoretical specific capacity and showed comparable material utilization, efficiency, and cycling stability as reported for aqueous organic RTFBs.
To gain an insight into the SMRT charge-transfer mechanisms, we performed ex situ1H NMR spectroscopy to analyze the variations of the redox species in TBPDO upon electrochemical cycling. The 1H NMR spectra of TBPDO at different charge states (A–E) are displayed in Fig. 5. Four proton peaks located at 8.25, 8.06, 7.77, and 7.52 ppm, respectively, were noted and assigned to tetrahydrogenated TBPDO (TBPDO-4H) by comparison with the 1H NMR spectra of pristine TBPDO and chemically reduced TBPDO (Fig. S15†). When the cell was charged to 1.60 V, besides the signals of TBPDO-4H, three new proton peaks at 7.71, 7.56, and 7.03 ppm, respectively, appeared, revealing the presence of intermediate electrochemical hydrogenation products (TBPDO-2H). The proton signals ascribed to TBPDO-4H were generally weakened when the cell was discharged from 1.60 to 0.83 V, and disappeared completely when the cell was further discharged to 0.40 V. The intensities of the proton peaks associated with the intermediate species increased first and then decreased over the whole discharge process, demonstrating the electrochemical oxidation of TBPDO-4H consisted of two consecutive steps. Therefore, a possible reaction mechanism for the aqueous RTFB with TBPDO can be described below.

1H NMR post-analysis for the TBPDO was conducted after the charge–discharge cycles to elucidate the possible chemical transformation of the solid-state energy-storage materials during the cycling process. As shown in Fig. 6, no extra peaks were observed for TBPDO after 21 consecutive cycles, except for two weak aromatic proton peaks (δ ∼7.56 and ∼7.03 ppm) and a distinct N–H signal (δ ∼3.75 ppm, inset of Fig. 6) which were assigned to intermediate TBPDO-2H, revealing that TBPDO was highly chemically stable during the cycling process.

Conclusions
In summary, we demonstrated an aqueous organic RTFB with considerably enhanced anodic volumetric capacity, high energy efficiency, and excellent cycling stability based on Nernstian potential-driven redox-targeting reactions. The aqueous RTFB cell employed an insoluble π-conjugated heterocyclic compound, TBPDO, loaded in the anodic tank to effectively boost the capacity. The charges were reversibly stored in TBPDO by the redox-targeting reactions between the TBPDO and the two redox shuttle molecules during the charging–discharging processes. Owing to the high specific capacity of TBPDO and highly matched redox potentials between TBPDO and the redox shuttle molecules, this cell may in theory deliver an anodic tank energy density as high as 423.8 W h L−1. With a rational combination of low-cost and robust organic energy-storage materials and redox shuttle molecules, the aqueous organic RTFB prototype system demonstrated here would be expected to expedite the successful exploration of sustainable eco-friendly large-scale energy-storage batteries.
Experimental
Synthesis
The key reagents were: 2,3-dichloro-1,4-naphthoquinone (DCNQ, 98 wt%, Alfa-Aesar), acetonitrile (Sinopharm Chemical Reagent), potassium phthalimide (98 wt%, Sigma-Aldrich), anthrafravic acid (2,6-dihydroxyanthraquinone, 97 wt%, TCI), lawsone (2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone, 98 wt%, TCI), hydrazine hydrate (Sinopharm Chemical Reagent), 9,10-phenanthrenedione (98 wt%, TCI), and phthalic acid (Sinopharm Chemical Reagent).
2,3-Diamino-1,4-naphthoquinone (DANQ): DCNQ (19 g, 44 mmol) was dissolved in 200 mL of acetonitrile (ACN) before potassium phthalimide (16.5 g, 89.1 mmol) was added. Then, the reaction mixture was refluxed for 12 h under a nitrogen atmosphere. After cooling to room temperature, the yellow precipitant was collected by suction filtration, dried under vacuum, and transferred to a round-bottomed flask containing distilled water. After 10 mL of hydrazine hydrate (90 wt%) was added, the reaction solution was stirred continuously for 12 h at 60 °C. After cooling to room temperature, a dark blue product was obtained by suction filtration, which was further purified by ethanol recrystallization.35 The yield of DANQ was 7.46 g (∼90%).
Tribenzo[a,c,i]phenazine-10,15-dione (TBPDO): DANQ (188 mg, 1 mmol), 9,10-phenanthraquinone (208 mg, 1 mmol), and phthalic acid (8 mg, 0.05 mmol) were successively added to a mixed solution composed of ethanol (7 mL) and deionized water (3 mL). The mixture was then stirred at 60 °C for 2 h. After cooling to room temperature, 30 mL of deionized water was added. The reaction mixture was kept at room temperature for another 12 h to ensure almost complete precipitation. The final product was collected by suction filtration, washed with deionized water and ethanol in turn, and then dried in vacuum at 60 °C for 24 h.
Characterization
Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FITR) was performed on a Nicolet Protege 460 spectrophotometer using dried KBr powder as tablet accessories.1 H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy was performed on a Bruker Advance III 400 MHz spectrometer using CDCl3 as the solvent.
Electrochemical measurements
Electrochemical experiments were carried on a CHI660B potentiostat (CH Instruments) under a nitrogen atmosphere utilizing a conventional three-electrode cell, where platinum plate and a Hg/HgO system served as the counter and reference electrodes, respectively. A TBPDO-coated glassy carbon (GC) electrode (3 mm diameter) was used as the working electrode, which was obtained according to a preparation procedure described earlier.33 A 1 M KOH solution was used as the supporting electrolyte. The potential was reported relative to the standard hydrogen electrode (SHE), which was converted from the Hg/HgO reference electrode (0.098 V vs. SHE).
Flow cell measurements
A commercial flow cell configuration (active area of 5 cm2, Fuel Cell Technologies) was used for the flow cell experiments. Stacked sheets of carbon paper (×2, Toray TGP-H-060) that were pretreated using a mixture of concentrated sulfuric acid and concentrated nitric acid (3:1, v/v) at about 50 °C for 3 h served as the anode and cathode, respectively. A piece of N112 proton exchange membrane (DuPont) sandwiched between the anode and cathode was utilized as a separator. 50 mM anthrafravic acid + 50 mM lawsone in 1 M KOH solution (5 mL) was used as the anolyte, while 300 mM K4[Fe(CN)6] + 75 mM K3[Fe(CN)6] in 1 M KOH solution (10 or 20 mL) was utilized as the catholyte. Excess quantities of ferrocyanide/ferricyanide were used at the cathode side to ensure that the anolyte was the capacity-limiting side. The electrolytes were pumped into and out from the flow cell at a constant rate of 60 mL min−1. The powdered TBPDO sample was loaded on to a solvent filter (Capsid), which was employed as the container of the solid-state energy-storage material and was placed in the flow path for an anolyte. The flow cell was tested in a nitrogen-filled glove box. Galvanostatic cell cycling was conducted on a Neware battery testing system.
Calculation of the energy density of the TBPDO-based RTFB
With 50% porosity of the energy-storage material in the tank as a benchmark, the effective concentration of electrons in porous TBPDO solid was 11.85 M since the concentration of electrons in TBPDO could be estimated to be 23.7 M based on its density (2.129 g cm−3) and molecular weight (360 g mol−1). Since the discharge voltage of the cell was determined by the average value of two redox potentials of TBPDO (−0.625 V vs. SHE), the anodic tank energy density based on TBPDO could be calculated with the following equation:40 Wvol = (1–50%)nρVdcF/(3.6Mw) (W h L−1)(1)where Wvol is the volumetric energy density of the solid energy-storage material; ρ is the density of TBPDO; Vdc is the discharge voltage; n is the effective number of electrons during the discharge process (n = 4); F is Faraday's constant (96485 C mol−1); and Mw is the molar mass of TBPDO. Therefore, the volumetric energy density was calculated to be about 351.9 W h L−1. In addition, anthrafravic acid and lawsone dissolved in aqueous electrolyte contributed additional energy to the cell. The solubility of anthrafravic acid in 1 M KOH was around 0.6 M, while that of lawsone was about 0.62 M. As anthrafravic acid and lawsone presented two discharge plateaus at 1.20 and 1.00 V, respectively, this could translate into an additional energy density of 71.9 W h L−1 by taking account of half of the volume occupied by TBPDO in the anodic tank. Therefore, at the solubility limit of anthrafravic acid and lawsone, the cell will in theory deliver an anodic tank energy density of 423.8 W h L−1 when the porosity of TBPDO granules is 50%.40
