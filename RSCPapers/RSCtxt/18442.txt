    , Accepted 19th June 2014First published on 19th June 2014AbstractMetal–organic frameworks (MOFs) have been used in the area of photovoltaic devices via a novel approach proposed here for the first time. Hierarchical ZnO parallelepipeds were prepared from a MOF precursor, which could then act as an effective light scattering layer in dye-sensitized solar cells, leading to significantly improved cell performance.
Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) have attracted much attention in recent years due to the distinct advantages of a high surface area and controllable porous structure. These features of MOFs provide a great platform for many applications such as catalysis, gas storage and separation, drug delivery, sensing and so on.1–3 Moreover, MOFs can serve as templates for obtaining well-dispersed nanoparticles or derivatives with excellent activities.4,5 Recently, MOFs have been applied to studies in the field of electrochemistry, such as rechargeable batteries, supercapacitors, hydrogen evolution and photovoltaic devices.6 In fact, MOFs have been used as photovoltaic materials in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) and they have become the focus of intensive research since they were first introduced into DSSCs as a coating layer in our previous work.7 Two kinds of MOF, MOF-5 and Al2(BDC)3, were used directly as the active material for photovoltaic devices, but the resulting efficiencies were very low.8 A ZnO film prepared by calcining two Zn-based homochiral MOFs was sensitized using N719 dye and gave rise to an efficiency of less than 0.2%.9 Besides research efforts into electrode materials, Cu-based MOFs have been utilized as sensitizers in DSSCs and have shown well-matched energy cascades with TiO2.10 A Mg-based MOF has been used as an additive in a polymer electrolyte, improving the long-term stability of DSSCs.11 However, the study of MOFs in the DSSC community is still in its infancy and the difficulty is what form MOFs should be employed in DSSCs.
The great demand for sustainable and renewable energy means that DSSCs have become a hot research topic during the last few decades due to their advantages of high power conversion efficiency and low production costs.12 In order to achieve good performance, solar cells should have an excellent ability to absorb incident light. In a DSSC device, the photoanode is typically composed of nanoparticles with sizes of around 20 nm, which suggests a large surface area and adsorption amount of dyes are needed for efficient light harvesting. However, nanoparticles of this size are poor at scattering incident light in the visible light region, thus reducing the availability of incident photons. To solve this problem and enhance the performance of DSSCs, a bilayer structure has been developed for photoanodes by introducing an optical scattering layer with particle that are submicrometer sized in at least one dimension. For example, TiO2 nanorod microspheres,13 ZnO nanorod aggregates,14 SnO2 hollow microspheres,15 cubic CeO2 nanoparticles16 and even Y3Al5O12:Ce phosphors17 have been used as effective scattering layers in DSSCs for improved light harvesting, resulting in obvious enhancements in the short-circuit photocurrent (Jsc) and power conversion efficiency.
In this report, we have created a model for the application of MOF materials in the field of DSSCs. For the first time, MOF-5, a kind of MOF, was screen printed on a ZnO film. Hierarchical ZnO parallelepipeds were obtained after calcination and these acted as an effective scattering layer, resulting in the greatly improved performance of dye-sensitized ZnO solar cells.
Preparation of the ZnO and MOF-5 paste, and other detailed experimental procedures can be found in the ESI.† FTO glass was used as the electron conducting substrate. A photoanode with a FTO/ZnO structure was labelled as cell 1. Cell 2 was prepared by screen-printing MOF-5 onto cell 1 and followed by calcination at 525 °C. In order to improve the performance of device further, cell 2 was immersed in a growth solution of ZIF-8 (another widely used MOF) as described in our previous report,7 and the resulting device was labelled as cell 3. Ideally, cell 3 should have the structure: FTO/ZnO/ZnO scattering layer/ZIF-8.
The morphology of the ZnO overlayer was observed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and is shown in Fig. 1. As can be seen from the figure, hierarchical ZnO parallelepipeds were formed due to the decomposition of MOF-5. It is noticeable that the angle between the a and b axis of each ZnO parallelepiped is close to 60°, as shown in Fig. 1(a). This angle is the same as the theoretical value of close-packed ZnO nanoparticles, and quite different than the normally observed 90° of ZnO cubes, which have also been formed from the decomposition of a MOF-5 precursor.18 It is possible that the ethyl cellulose and α-terpineol used in the paste played the role of templates. By measuring some of the vertically standing ZnO aggregates in Fig. 1(b), the thicknesses of the ZnO parallelepipeds are found to be in the range of 300–500 nm, which should result in a good ability to scatter incident light.19 Moreover, the length and width of each as-formed ZnO parallelepiped are around 1–2 μm and 0.5–1 μm, respectively. Fig. 1(c) shows the morphology of the hierarchical ZnO parallelepipeds on a larger scale. The X-ray diffraction patterns (XRD) of the ZnO films printed on FTO are shown in Fig. 1(d) and both match well with the peaks of standard ZnO (PDF#:74-0534). The pattern for cell 2 has no any peaks arising coming from MOF-5, indicating the successful transformation of MOF-5 into ZnO aggregates due to its decomposition.

The performance of DSSCs is greatly influenced by the thickness of the photoanode film. Thus, the film thickness was first optimized for both of the ZnO layers. It was found that the optimum thickness for the ZnO underlayer was about 12.0 μm, while this was around 3.8 μm for the ZnO overlayer, which worked as the scattering layer. Detailed parameters can be found in Table S1 and S2 (ESI†). Therefore, all of the cells were prepared based on the optimized film thicknesses. The I–V curves of the dye-sensitized ZnO solar cells are plotted in Fig. 2 and the corresponding parameters are listed in Table 1. For cell 1, it delivered a Jsc value of 7.39 mA cm−2, an open-circuit photovoltage (Voc) of 636 mV, a fill factor of 0.67, and a power conversion efficiency of 3.15%. By contrast, cell 2 demonstrated an obvious increase in Jsc, which could be ascribed to the bilayer structure of the photoanode due to the as-formed hierarchical ZnO nanostructure. ZIF-8 was then introduced, which inhibits interfacial charge recombination and enhances the performance of the device due to an energy barrier effect, as discussed in our previous study.7 As shown in the results in Table 1, the efficiency of cell 3 increased by 16.5% from 3.15% to 3.67% in comparison to cell 1.

In order to investigate the possible reasons for the enhanced performance of the dye-sensitized ZnO solar cells, the diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) of the devices were measured. In a DSSC device, the photoanode should have an excellent ability to harvest light. Generally, there are two approaches to realize this ambition. One is to synthesize nanoparticles with large surface areas, which can adsorb as much dye as possible. The other is to increase the journey length of the light travelling through the photoanode film, which enhances the possibility of light trapping. Previous studies have demonstrated that the light travelling distance could be effectively enhanced by introducing a light scattering layer, which should have a particle size of around a few hundred nanometers in at least one dimension.13–17 Therefore, the hierarchical ZnO parallelepipeds, which were prepared simply from the decomposition of MOF-5 were expected to play the role of a scattering layer. As shown in Fig. 3(a), cell 2 exhibited a much better ability to scatter incident light over the whole visible light region compared with cell 1. This result is in good agreement with our prediction and suggests that the improved performances of cell 2 and cell 3 could be ascribed to their enhanced light harvesting ability. However, the performance of DSSCs is greatly related to the amount of loaded dye. The improved performance of cell 2 could have been due to enhanced dye adsorption, as shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). To settle the matter, the incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of cell 1 and cell 2 were measured and compared. If the improved Jsc was due to enhanced dye adsorption, this would be reflected in the related IPCE spectra at shorter wavelengths. Contrary to this, an improved IPCE value in the longer wavelength region would be due to the light scattering capacity.20 According to the IPCE spectra shown in Fig. 3(b) and (c), cell 2 has a larger IPCE value than cell 1 between 500–700 nm, demonstrating that it is the improved light scattering ability that plays a more important role in the enhanced efficiency of cell 2. The electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) of all of the samples were also measured in the frequency range of 100 mHz to 100 kHz in order to clarify the property of interfacial charge recombination. The bias used was −0.7 V with an amplitude of the alternative signal of 5 mV. Nyquist plots of the impedance data are shown in Fig. 3(d). In a typical EIS of DSSCs, the three semi-circles could be attributed to the resistance values at Pt/electrolyte, ZnO/dye/electrolyte and the diffusion of the electrolyte, from which the degree of interfacial charge recombination could be determined.21 According to the equivalent circuit diagram shown in the inset of Fig. 3(d), the impedance values for the interfacial charge recombination Rrec of cell 1, cell 2 and cell 3 are calculated to be 10.1, 8.1 and 8.4 Ω, respectively. The larger the Rrec value, the better inhibition of charge recombination, thus, interfacial charge recombination is most severe for cell 2, which may be ascribed to the additional centers for charge recombination due to the introduction of the ZnO scattering layer.22 However, the benefits of the improved light harvesting surpass the disadvantages of increased charge recombination, resulting in an overall enhancement of the cell performance. It should be noted that although cell 2 has more severe charge recombination than cell 1, its Voc value is larger. The Voc value of a DSSC depends on the difference between the Fermi level of the semiconductor and the redox potential,23 but it can be affected by many other parameters. Herein, the increased Voc value of cell 2 may be the result of the enhanced current density, which can raise the Fermi level of ZnO to a certain extent, offsetting the Voc loss.24 In line with our previous study, the charge recombination in cell 2 could be improved by using a coating of ZIF-8, as demonstrated by the increased Rrec value of cell 3.11 Ultimately, cell 3 exhibited the best performance among the three devices.

Compared with cell 1, the efficiency of cell 3 was obviously increased by 16.5%. According to the above discussion, this could be ascribed to the introduction of the scattering layer and the energy barrier effect of the ZIF-8 coating. However, which one is more important? Our previous study showed that, although ZIF-8 could inhibit interfacial charge recombination, it had little effect on the improved efficiency.7 This conclusion is also true for the ZnO based DSSCs studied here. A device coated with ZIF-8, but without the ZnO scattering layer was assembled, and the corresponding curve is plotted in Fig. S2 (ESI†). The results demonstrate that the coating of ZIF-8 has a very limited influence on the efficiency improvement. Therefore, the greatly enhanced performance of cell 3 was mainly caused by the ZnO scattering layer. As illustrated in Fig. 4, the hierarchical ZnO parallelepipeds effectively scatter the incident light and improve the light harvesting ability of the ZnO film, playing a key role in improving the cell performance.

In summary, we have proposed a novel approach for the application of MOFs in the field of DSSCs. Hierarchical ZnO parallelepipeds with thicknesses of around 300–500 nm were prepared from the decomposition of a MOF-5 precursor, and then were used as an effective scattering layer in the bilayer photoanodes of DSSCs, resulting in a remarkable enhancement in cell performance. This study provides an interesting example of the application of MOFs in photovoltaic devices, and the study of other MOFs in a similar manner could be anticipated due to the widespread study of MOF morphology.
