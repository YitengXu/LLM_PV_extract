    , Accepted 25th August 2020First published on 26th August 2020AbstractConstructing two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals heterostructures (vdWHs) with type-II band alignments has recently emerged as a promising strategy to obtain desirable optoelectronic devices. In this work, by density functional theory calculations we systematically investigate the stabilities, band structures and potential photocatalytic and photovoltaic properties of the vdWHs fabricated by combining 2D Janus-In2SeTe with a C2N monolayer. Herein, two types of Janus-In2SeTe/C2N vdWHs are considered: TeIn2Se/C2N and SeIn2Te/C2N heterostructures. The calculation results show that these systems possess direct gaps, type-II band alignments, low exciton binding energies, high carrier mobilities with asymmetry and strong light-harvesting ability in the UV-visible region. Remarkably, the band-edge positions of both the vdWHs perfectly straddle the water redox potential energies at certain pHs, enabling them to be very promising photocatalysts for overall water splitting. Besides, the power conversion efficiency can be as high as 18.25% and 21.47% for TeIn2Se/C2N and SeIn2Te/C2N vdWHs, respectively. These extraordinary properties render Janus-In2SeTe/C2N vdWHs to have great potential applications in the fields of clean and sustainable energy.
1 Introduction
The strong and escalating demand for green and renewable energy has motivated researchers to search for high-efficient photovoltaic and photocatalytic semiconductor materials. For practical applications, a promising photovoltaic semiconductor should satisfy some criteria such as the efficient capturing and utilization of visible light, low exciton recombination rate, small exciton binding energy, high carrier mobility, etc. Besides, for an efficient and useful photocatalyst, its band edges should also straddle the redox potentials of water. That is to say, the conduction band minimum (CBM) energy must be higher than the water reduction potential (VH+/H2: −4.44 eV), while the valence band maximum (VBM) energy should be lower than the water oxidation potential (VO2/H2O: −5.67 eV).1 In recent years, a large number of two-dimensional (2D) materials have been proposed as candidates to be used in photocatalysis and photovoltaics, including single-layer group-III (IV) monochalcogenides,2,3 transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs)1,4 and C2N.5 However, a great challenge still remains for large-scale practical applications: the photogenerated carriers are not well separated spatially, which can lead to a fast electron–hole recombination and thus reduce the solar energy conversion. Interestingly enough, the fabrication of type-II van der Waals heterostructures (vdWHs) by stacking different 2D semiconductor materials has been demonstrated to be a promising way to overcome this weakness, where photogenerated electrons and holes are confined separately in the two materials, thereby inhibiting the rate of recombination.6,7 Also, the range of light-absorption may be broadened, which will enhance the utilization of solar energy. Therefore, developing heterostructures with type II band alignments is strongly in demand.
Recently, indium monochalcogenides (InX, X = S, Se and Te) have attracted intense interest due to their useful properties such as efficient photocatalytic activity, high carrier mobility, and so on.2,8,9 It was reported that all of these InX monolayers are dynamically stable semiconductors with indirect band gaps and their electronic and optical properties can be engineered by strains.9,10 Therefore, the InSe monolayer has been successfully realized in experiments and shows high electron mobility comparable to that of black phosphorus at room temperature.11–13 More recently, a new type of InX material, namely Janus In2XY (X/Y = S, Se and Te) monolayers, was theoretically confirmed to possess great thermodynamic and dynamic stability.14 Considering the fact that the Janus MXY (M = Mo, W; X, Y = S, Se, and Te) monolayer has been successfully synthesized by sulfurization in MoSe2 or selenization in MoS2,15,16 it is reasonable to expect that these Janus monolayers can be obtained by similar means. First-principles calculations show that the Janus-In2SeTe monolayer owns a direct gap and suitable band alignment for the overall water splitting.17 Besides, a newly synthesized 2D C2N was found to be a semiconductor with a direct band gap.5 Its electronic and optical properties can be tuned by varying the external environment or internal structure.18–21 These characters make C2N potentially a very useful material for future applications in optoelectronic conversion or as a photocatalyst for water splitting into hydrogen.20,22
So far, many type-II InX-based and C2N-based vdWHs have been theoretically proposed and experimentally fabricated, and thus they can potentially be used in photocatalysis and photovoltaics. The InSe/GaTe vdWH has been fabricated experimentally and presents type-II band alignment.23,24 The InSe/InTe vdWH was verified to be a direct-band-gap type-II semiconductor and has enhanced optical absorption intensity.25 The InSe/Zr2CO2 vdWH was proved to be a robust and promising visible-light photocatalyst.26 Various type-II C2N/semiconductor vdWHs, such as C2N/g-C3N4, C2N/MoS2, C2N/CdS, and C2N/WS2, and so forth, were found to have the enhanced separation capability of electron–hole pairs.27–30 In particular, the strained C2N/GaTe(InTe) vdWHs exhibit good photocatalytic activity and high power conversion efficiency.22,31 Inspired by the aforementioned remarkable works, together with the small lattice mismatch between the Janus-In2SeTe (2 × 2 × 1) supercell and C2N unit cell,5,32 in this work, through first-principles calculations, we systematically investigate the possibilities of Janus-In2SeTe/C2N vdWHs as potential photocatalytic or photovoltaic materials. Our calculated results show that Janus-In2SeTe/C2N vdWHs are direct band gap semiconductors with intrinsic type-II band alignments and strong visible-UV light absorption. Importantly, they could be promising candidates for overall photocatalytic water splitting. Finally, the high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of the Janus-In2SeTe/C2N vdWHs with different strains have been predicted, which make them potential bifunctional materials applied in both photocatalysis and photovoltaics.
2 Computational methods
In the present work, the structural optimization and electronic properties of all monolayers and their vdWHs are investigated by density functional theory (DFT) calculations, which is implemented in the Vienna ab initio simulation package.33 We used the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) as parameterized by Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof (PBE).34 The DFT-D2 level35 was adopted to consider the long-range effect of the vdW interactions. To compensate the underestimated band gaps in the GGA/PBE calculations, the hybrid Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof (HSE06) functional method36,37 is utilized to obtain accurate electronic structures and optical properties. In the HSE06 method, we adopt the mixing parameter of 0.25 and the screen factor of 0.20 Å−1. A more than 30 Å vacuum layer along the z-direction is used to avoid interactions between adjacent 2D monolayers. The plane wave energy cutoff of 500 eV, the energy convergence criteria of 10−5 eV, the force convergence of 0.01 eV Å−1, and the k-mesh of 21 × 21 × 1 (11 × 11 × 1) for the PBE (HSE06) calculations are sufficient to give well-converged results.
3 Results and discussions
Before constructing the 2D Janus-In2SeTe/C2N heterostructures, we first explore geometrical structures and electronic properties of the pristine C2N and Janus-In2SeTe monolayers. The C2N sheet is a holey structure of benzene rings bridged by nitrogen atoms, as demonstrated in Fig. 1(a), while the pristine Janus-In2SeTe monolayer contains four atomic sublayers with two layers of In ions sandwiched between the Se and Te layers, as shown in Fig. 1(c). The organized Janus-In2SeTe monolayer can be obtained by fully replacing one of two Se (Te) layers with Te (Se) atoms in the InSe (InTe) monolayer. The optimized lattice constants within GGA–PBE are 8.32 and 4.24 Å for the C2N and In2SeTe monolayers, respectively. Their band structures are also investigated by the PBE/HSE06 calculations and displayed in Fig. 1(b) and (d), respectively. Apparently, both the monolayers are direct-band gap semiconductors with both CBM and VBM locating at the Γ point of the two-dimensional hexagonal Brillouin zone. The band gaps calculated by PBE/HSE06 are 1.65/2.44 and 1.15/1.82 eV for the C2N and Janus-In2SeTe monolayers, respectively. As listed in Table 1, all of the results are in good agreement with the previously reported data,14,29,38 indicating the credibility of our approach (see the ESI† for further discussion: Discussion S1).

Furthermore, we would like to mention that the electronic properties of the Janus-In2SeTe monolayer are checked with and without a dipole correction applied. It is found that the dipole correction has a very small effect on its band dispersions. Meanwhile, we find that its electrostatic potential distributions calculated with the dipole correction are asymmetric, where there is a vacuum level difference (0.34 eV) between the two sides for the Janus-In2SeTe monolayer (see Fig. S1, ESI†). A similar characteristic can also be observed in the electrostatic potential distributions of the PtSSe39 and In2X3 (X = S, Se, and Te)40 monolayers. More specifically, the vacuum level of the Se-terminated surface is obviously larger than that of the Te-terminated one, which induces an intrinsic spontaneous polarization (P) with its direction pointing from the Se-atom layer to the Te-atom layer.41,42 Therefore, in the following calculations, the dipole correction is not considered, except for the calculation of electrostatic potentials.
We now design and discuss the geometric structures and electronic properties of the Janus-In2SeTe/C2N heterostructures. The heterostructures are constructed based on a supercell model, in which a 2 × 2 × 1 supercell of the Janus-In2SeTe monolayer is stacked on a unit cell of the C2N nanosheet. The small lattice mismatch (1.89%) between Janus-In2SeTe and C2N is favorable to form the heterostructures in terms of the vdW interactions, i.e. vdWHs.43 Here, we note that Janus-In2SeTe/C2N vdWHs have two types because of different kinds of chalcogen atoms on both sides of the In2SeTe monolayer. As illustrated in Fig. S2 (ESI†), the first one is called TeIn2Se/C2N vdWH, in which the Se sublayer in Janus In2SeTe touches with the C2N monolayer, whereas the other one is named SeIn2Te/C2N vdWH, where the Te layer in Janus In2SeTe connects with the C2N monolayer. In order to find the stable configurations of the heterostructures, we shift the Janus-In2SeTe monolayers in different directions. As a result, three energetically favorable stacking configurations with high symmetry named as α-, β- and γ-stacking are obtained. Fig. 2 displays top and side views of SeIn2Te/C2N vdWH, which can also be considered as schematics of TeIn2Se/C2N vdWH. In the α-stacking, the hexagonal In2SeTe rings are right over the hexagonal C4N2 rings. As for the β- and γ-stacking, they can be obtained by moving the In2SeTe layer in the α-stacking along the a + b direction. To compare the relative stabilities of the three stacking configurations, we calculate their interface binding energies, Eb = (EH − EIn2SeTe − EC2N)/S, where EH, EIn2SeTe, and EC2N represent the total energies of the Janus-In2SeTe/C2N heterostructures, and the In2SeTe and C2N monolayers, respectively, and S is the surface area of the 2D supercell. The calculated binding energies and interlayer distances are listed in Table 1. Obviously, the formation values of all the interfaces are exothermic (negative Eb) and the γ-stacking configurations possess comparatively smaller binding energies and interlayer distances, making them more favorable. Furthermore, the thermal stabilities of the two heterostructures with the γ-stacking configuration are researched by using ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations. As shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†), the amplitude of fluctuation for total energy is small during the AIMD process. Meanwhile, no breaking of bonds and structure distortion except very small deviations are observed in the snapshots after annealing for 8 ps up to 400 K, which confirms that the γ-stacking configuration is thermally stable at room temperature and even higher temperatures. Therefore, in the following sections, all the calculations and discussions are based on the γ-stacking heterostructures.

We next focus on the electronic properties of the Janus-In2SeTe/C2N vdWHs. The projected band structures of the TeIn2Se/C2N and SeIn2Te/C2N vdWHs are calculated based on the HSE06 hybrid functional method and plotted in Fig. 3(a) and (b), respectively. Obviously, the band structures of the Janus-In2SeTe layer and the C2N layer are nearly retained, resulting from the small lattice mismatch and weak vdW interaction. The CBMs mainly stem from the C2N sublayer, while the VBMs are primarily due to the Janus-In2SeTe monolayer, implying that these heterostructures have type-II band alignment with the staggered gaps, which will be beneficial for the separation of the electron–hole pairs and enable high efficiency solar energy conversion.44 In both the cases, direct band gaps are observed, with the values of 1.64 and 1.33 eV for TeIn2Se/C2N and SeIn2Te/C2N vdWHs, respectively. Their band gaps are more than the minimum band gap required for water splitting (1.23 eV),45 showing potential applications as visible light photocatalysts. Furthermore, it is well known that direct band gap semiconductors will allow a high absorption coefficient and highly efficient electron–hole pair generation.46 From the projected densities of states (PDOS) of the heterostructures depicted in Fig. 3 (right panels), it can be seen that the VBMs are primarily composed of a Te-5p state and few In-5p states, while the conduction bands are mainly occupied by 2p states of the N and C atoms. This is further confirmed by the spatial charge distributions of the VBMs and CBMs, as shown in the insets of Fig. 3. Obviously, the spatial charges of CBMs are notably located in the C and N atoms, while those of the CBMs are mainly distributed in the Te atom, which is well consistent with the results of PDOS discussed.

The corresponding orbital-resolved partial densities of states are given in their right panels, showing contributions from the C-2p, N-2p, In-5p, Se-4p and Te-5p states. The solid arrows indicate the lowest energy transition. The corresponding insets are partial charge densities of the VBM and CBM with the isovalue equal to 0.002 e Å−3. 
As we know, the charge redistribution in heterostructures usually leads to strong orbital overlapping and a highly efficient electron transfer for photovoltaic performance.47 Therefore, for the Janus-In2SeTe/C2N heterostructures, three-dimensional (3D) charge density differences (CDDs) are evaluated by Δρ = ρH − ρIn2SeTe − ρC2N, where ρIn2SeTe, ρC2N and ρH are the charge densities of In2SeTe, the C2N monolayer and the Janus-In2SeTe/C2N heterostructures in the same configuration, respectively. The results are illustrated in Fig. 4(c) and (d), where yellow and blue indicate charge accumulation and depletion, respectively. Clearly, as a result of the interlayer coupling effect, significant charge redistribution exists in the Janus-In2SeTe/C2N heterointerfaces. The plane-averaged CDDs for the TeIn2Se/C2N and SeIn2Te/C2N vdWHs along the directions normal to the interfaces are calculated and shown in Fig. 4(a) and (b), respectively. The oscillations in the curves reveal that there is inner-layer charge density rearrangement in each individual and the oscillation strength is enhanced near the interface. Further Bader charge analyses unveil that approximately 0.05 and 0.07 |e| per unit cell are transferred from Janus-In2SeTe to C2N for TeIn2Se/C2N and SeIn2Te/C2N vdWHs, respectively. This means that an intrinsic built-in electric field (Ein) is induced with its direction pointing from the Janus-In2SeTe layer to C2N layer. The amount of charge transfer in the latter is bigger than that in the former, which is due to the difference of atomic radii and electronegativities between Se and Te atoms adjacent to the C2N sublayer. Furthermore, more charge transfer usually means a stronger interlayer interaction, which leads to the shifts of band edges and induces a smaller bandgap, in line with the above researches and results. Fig. 4(e) and (f) display the profiles of the planar-averaged electrostatic potentials with a dipole correction applied along the z axes of the TeIn2Se/C2N and SeIn2Te/C2N vdWHs, respectively. The work functions (Φ) obtained by aligning the Fermi level with reference to the vacuum energy level are also labeled. It is evident that the Janus-In2SeTe layer has a higher potential than the C2N layer, driving electrons to move from the Janus-In2SeTe layer to C2N, which is consistent with the results of the Bader charge analyses. As given in Table 1, compared with the work functions of the Janus-In2SeTe and C2N sheets, those of the heterostructures are decreased because of the efficient interfacial formation and charge transfer. The low work function means that the electron transition would get easier between the VBM and CBM edges under light irradiation.48 Meanwhile, we note that there is a large potential drop (ΔV′) at the interface of the heterostructure, which can lower the photoexcited electron–hole recombination rate and thus enhance the power conversion efficiency. Interestingly, the TeIn2Se/C2N heterostructure has a negligible potential difference between the vacuum level on the Janus-In2SeTe and C2N sides relative to the isolated Janus-In2SeTe monolayer (Fig. S1(b), ESI†), while the SeIn2Te/C2N heterostructure shows an enhanced potential difference of the vacuum level. Such results can originate from two mechanisms: interfacial electric field (Ein) and intrinsic spontaneous polarization field (P) in the Janus-In2SeTe sublayer.42,49 Specifically, when Ein and P are in the same (opposite) direction, the potential difference of the vacuum level will be enhanced (weakened and even counteracted). Similar behaviour is also found in MXene/GaN heterostructures,42 and this vacuum level shift can also bring a change in the band gap.42

To understand the transfer and separation of photoinduced electron–hole pairs in more detail, the band alignments of the TeIn2Se/C2N and SeIn2Te/C2N vdWHs from analysis of Fig. 3 are illustrated in Fig. 5(a) and (b), respectively. Obviously, in both the vdWHs, the CBMs and VBMs of the Janus-In2SeTe layers are higher in energy than the corresponding bands of the C2N sheet, implying the formations of the staggered (type-II) band alignments. For the TeIn2Se/C2N and SeIn2Te/C2N vdWHs, the calculated values (ΔEv) of the valence band offset (VBO) are 0.72 and 1.00 eV, while those (ΔEc) of the conduction band offset (CBO) are about 0.20 and 0.52 eV, respectively. The bandgaps of the In2SeTe and C2N sublayers are around 1.84 and 2.35 eV, respectively, with little change compared to those of the isolated monolayers, as previously indicated. When the vdWHs are illuminated with light, for the both the Janus-In2SeTe and C2N sheets, the valence electrons with high energy obtained from the sunlight can leap into the conduction bands. Subsequently, these photoexcited electrons on the CB of the Janus-In2SeTe sheet can be easily shifted to that of the C2N layer owing to the CBO. Conversely, the VBO can drive the photoinduced holes in the VB of the C2N sheet to migrate to the VB of the Janus-In2SeTe layer. As a result, the photogenerated carries can be effectively separated on different surfaces, which can reduce the energy-wasteful exciton recombination and thus is beneficial for photocatalysis and photovoltaics. To further qualitatively evaluate the efficiency of photogenerated carrier separation, the exciton binding energies (Eeb) are calculated using the Mott–Wannier model:50Eeb = 13.6μex/(m0ε2), where μex, m0 and ε are effective exciton mass, the electron mass and static dielectric constant, respectively. As such, μex is given by μex = memh/(me + mh). As summarized in Table S1 (ESI†), the Eeb for the C2N monolayer is found to be 1.14 eV, which is consistent with the previously reported values.30 The TeIn2Se/C2N and SeIn2Te/C2N vdWH heterostructures present much low Eeb values of 0.12 and 0.14 eV, respectively, which will facilitate separation of the carriers.

Band edge positions of the (c) TeIn2Se/C2N and (d) SeIn2Te/C2N vdWHs, referring to the vacuum level. The redox potentials of water splitting at pH 0 (blue dashed line) and pH 2 (red dashed line) are shown for comparison. 
As mentioned above, the Janus-In2SeTe/C2N vdWHs have suitable bandgaps as visible light photocatalysts. Here, the photocatalytic activities for Janus-In2SeTe/C2N vdWHs are evaluated by comparing their band edge positions to the redox potentials of H+/H2 and O2/H2O. According to the mechanism proposed by Yang et al.,39,40,51 we align the band edge levels relative to the redox levels of water. As shown in Fig. 5(c), the VBM of the TeIn2Se/C2N vdWH is 0.03 eV lower than the oxidation potential of O2/H2O at pH = 0, and the CBM is 0.30 eV higher than the reduction potential of H+/H2 at pH = 0, indicating its overall water-splitting activity. Of course, we note that its oxidation energy levels are too close to the oxidation potential for O2/H2O at pH = 0, implying lower oxidizing power. Nevertheless, as we know, the water redox potentials are closely related to the aqueous solution pH and increase with pH by pH × 0.059 eV, shifting the redox energy levels of water upward.2,45 As illustrated in Fig. 5(c), the band edges of the TeIn2Se/C2N vdWH perfectly straddle the water redox potential at pH ≈ 2. Fig. 5(d) shows that the band edge positions of the SeIn2Te/C2N vdWH can straddle the redox level of water well. Importantly, the energy differences between the VBM (CBM) and the oxidation (reduction) potential level of water is 0.42 (0.26) eV, which are adequate for the H2/O2 production from water.
For the purposes of comparison, we also investigate electronic and photocatalytic properties of the InSe/C2N and InTe/C2N vdWHs. As shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†), the InSe/C2N vdWH exhibits an indirect band gap of 2.04 eV, where its CBM is located at the Γ point, while the VBM lies between the Γ and K points. Furthermore, we find that both the VBM and CBM are mainly localized on the InSe layer, which suggest that a type-I band alignment is formed at the interface between the C2N and InSe layers. Such characteristics in band structures induce the ultrafast recombination of the excited carriers and thus can be detrimental for photocatalysis.52 Conversely, the InTe/C2N vdWH is a direct semiconductor with a band gap of 1.31 eV. Its CBM and VBM are all located at the Γ point and mainly localized on the C2N and InTe sublayers, respectively. Therefore, a type-II band alignment is formed at the InTe/C2N interface, which will spontaneously separate the free electrons and holes, enabling high efficiency solar energy conversion.44 The corresponding band alignments also are given out in Fig. S5 (ESI†). The results show that the VBM of InTe/C2N vdWH is higher than the oxidation potential of O2/H2O, implying that such a material cannot produce O2 by water splitting at pH = 0. The band edges of the InSe/C2N vdWH straddle the redox potentials of water at pH = 0, suggesting the potential ability for water splitting. Nevertheless, as noted above, because of the lower water splitting activity of the type-I heterostructure, its photocatalytic efficiency can be insufficient.
For a promising photocatalytic or photovoltaic material, a high light-harvesting ability is essential, as well as a suitable electronic structure. Therefore, the absorption spectra of the Janus-In2SeTe/C2N vdWHs and the corresponding isolated layers are evaluated by A(ω) = ωLImε(ω)/c, where ω, L, Imε(ω) and c are the frequency of incident light, the length of the cell in the layer-normal direction, imaginary part of frequency-dependent dielectric function and light velocity, respectively.53 Therefore, Imε(ω) is calculated using the HSE06 functional. As shown in Fig. 6, the Janus-In2SeTe monolayer hardly absorbs visible light and shows only UV light absorption, while the C2N monolayer has a weak absorption peak around 3.09 eV and its absorption intensity decays quickly at the violet region. Fascinatingly, all the designed vdWHs show stronger visible-UV light absorption compared to that of the monolayer individuals, especially in the energy range of 2.18 to 4.18 eV. This arises from the fact that the new optical transitions can be induced by the interlayer coupling and charge transfer in the vdWHs.54–56 A similar phenomenon has been reported in some of our previous works.6,7 Therefore, it can be concluded that the Janus-In2SeTe/C2N vdWHs indeed could be promising solar light absorber materials.

High carrier mobility is another important indicator for efficient photocatalytic and photovoltaic applications.26,57 Herein, those in the heterostructures are predicted based on the deformation potential theory (see the ESI:† computational detail of the carrier mobility).58,59 Besides the carrier mobilities μ, the three related parameters, i.e., the effective masses m*, deformation potentials Eil, and elastic moduli C2D, are also summarized in Table 2. The mobilities of the C2N and Janus-In2SeTe monolayers exhibit asymmetric and anisotropy characteristics, with a high electron mobility of up to 103 cm2 V−1 s−1 and low hole mobility less than 102 cm2 V−1 s−1. Furthermore, the electron mobility along the y direction is faster than that along the x direction. On the other hand, the hole mobility shows an opposite tendency. These results are in line with previous reports.17,30,60 Similar behaviors are also found in the Janus-In2SeTe/C2N vdWHs. More interestingly, the μ in the heterostructures are relatively enhanced due to the more dispersed band and improved elastic modulus. Meanwhile, we find that the μ values along the y direction are higher than those along the x direction, and the velocities of electrons can be at least 27 times faster than those of the holes. In particular, the electron mobilities could reach about 2631 (5593) and 5208 (5530) cm2 V−1 s−1 along the x(y) directions for the TeIn2Se/C2N and SeIn2Te/C2N vdWHs, respectively, which are comparable to the case of black phosphorene (103–104 cm2 V−1 s−1).61 The high mobility would induce fast migration of carriers, and strong asymmetric features for electrons and holes could further suppress the recombination of the photo-generated electron–hole pairs, which will be beneficial for the photovoltaic and photocatalytic performances.

From the view of the applications, the quality of the photovoltaic heterojunction depends on its power conversion efficiency (PCE). Here, we estimate the upper limits of PCE (η) of the Janus-In2SeTe/C2N vdWHs by using Scharber's method,62 which is defined as follows:  where Edg, ΔEc and J(ħω) are the bandgap of the donor, the CBO value and the AM1.5 solar energy flux, respectively. In the two heterostructures, the In2SeTe layer is the donor because of its higher band edge, and C2N is the acceptor, as shown in Fig. 5. The calculated η values of the TeIn2Se/C2N and SeIn2Te/C2N vdWHs are about 16.26 and 12.21%, respectively, as marked in Fig. 7. These results are comparable and even superior to those of the recently reported C2N-based heterostructures, such as the GaS/C2N (17.8%)48 and InTe(GaTe)/C2N (∼7.72(10.74)%)31 systems. And their PCEs can be further enhanced by external strain (see the later discussion). This implies that the Janus-In2SeTe/C2N vdWHs can also be promising materials to be used in photovoltaic cells.
 Fig. 7  Simulated PCE contour plot versus the donor band gap and CBO. Constant efficiency level curves up to 23% are shown in the figure. The pentagons and spheres on the contour represent the efficiency limits of the TeIn2Se/C2N and SeIn2Te/C2N vdWHs under the different strains, respectively. 
As we know, concomitant strain in 2D materials cannot be erased. Finally, we will examine the effect of strain on the photovoltaic properties of the Janus-In2SeTe/C2N vdWHs. Here, the in-plane biaxial strain (ε) is defined as ε = [(a − a0)/a0] × 100%, where a and a0 are the optimized lattice constants with and without strain, respectively. Fig. 8 exhibits the band edge positions of the Janus-In2SeTe/C2N vdWHs under different biaxial strains. Obviously, under the increased tension strains, the CBM and VBM of the Janus-In2SeTe layer and the VBM of the C2N layer in the SeIn2Te/C2N heterostructure shift down, while the CBM and VBM of the C2N layer in the TeIn2Se/C2N heterostructure and the CBM of the C2N layer in the SeIn2Te/C2N heterostructure shift up. As a result, the Edg of the donor and the ΔEc of the heterostructures are effectively tuned by the strain, which can affect the PCE. Meanwhile, it should be emphasized that the type-II band alignments are maintained under compressive or little tensile strains. In the TeIn2Se/C2N heterostructure, the Edg and ΔEc are reduced under tensile strain, while the compressive strain induces a smaller Edg but increased ΔEc. Its maximum η value can reach about 18.25% under ∼2% biaxial strain (see Fig. 7). In the SeIn2Te/C2N heterostructure, the tensile strain effectively reduces the Edg and ΔEc and thus significantly improves the PCE. A PCE as high as ∼21.47% can be achieved under 5% tensile strain, as marked in Fig. 7, which is increased by about 76% compared with that of the pristine system. Meanwhile, we find that the light absorption of the heterostructures with high PCE under corresponding strains is maintained or even further enhanced (see Fig. 6). Therefore, the tensile strain is an effective way to enhance the PCE of the Janus-In2SeTe/C2N vdWHs.

4 Conclusions
In summary, by using first-principles calculations, we have systematically investigated the electronic and optical properties of the Janus-In2SeTe/C2N vdWHs with two different arrangements and exploited their potential photovoltaic and photocatalytic applications. Our results demonstrate that the Janus-In2SeTe/C2N vdWHs possess type-II band alignments, low exciton binding energies and high carrier mobilities with asymmetry, indicating the low recombination rates of the photogenerated electrons and holes. Compared with their composing Janus-In2SeTe and C2N monolayers, both the heterostructures exhibit dramatically reduced direct band gaps and more efficient optical absorption from the UV to visible light range. As a result, the high performance of the photocatalyst and photovoltaics are expected in the vdWHs. Specifically, comparison of the calculated band edge positions with the redox potentials of water shows that both the vdWHs are potential photocatalysts for water splitting under suitable pH conditions. The predicted PCEs for the pristine TeIn2Se/C2N and SeIn2Te/C2N vdWHs can be as high as ∼16 and 12%, respectively, suggesting powerful potential in making use of solar energy. Furthermore, it is interesting to note that the PCEs of Janus-In2SeTe/C2N vdWHs can be dramatically improved by the biaxial tensile strains. A 2% strain would increase the PCE of the TeIn2Se/C2N vdWH by about 12%, while a 5% strain could increase the PCE of the SeIn2Te/C2N vdWH by about 76%. All the results indicate that the Janus-In2SeTe/C2N vdWHs can be used as competitive candidates for next generation optoelectronic devices.
