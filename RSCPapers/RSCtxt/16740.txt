    , Accepted 30th April 2012First published on 25th May 2012AbstractA series of high-density double- and single-shelled ZnO/CdSe/CdTe, ZnO/CdTe/CdSe, ZnO/CdTe and ZnO/CdSe nanocable arrays were synthesized as photoanodes by an electrodeposition method using ZnO nanorod arrays as cores. For ZnO/CdSe/CdTe nanocable arrays, the uniform CdSe and CdTe nanoshells were composed of zinc-blende phase nanocrystals with a respective average size range of 10–20 nm and 7–15 nm, and formed a compact and continuous interface in between. Based on the band offset of the bulk material before contact and the interfacial Fermi level shift after contact, the energy level alignments at the CdSe/CdTe and CdTe/CdSe interface were deduced for the double-shelled nanocable arrays. The CdTe/CdSe interface of the ZnO/CdTe/CdSe nanocables has a negative band offset of −0.16 eV whilst for ZnO/CdSe/CdTe nanocables, the band edge of CdTe lies above CdSe with a conduction band offset of 0.16 eV at the CdSe/CdTe interface. Such a stepwise band alignment, together with the compact interface, fewer grain boundaries along the radial direction, and the fast transfer rate along the axial direction of the nanocables, makes the ZnO/CdSe/CdTe nanocable arrays photoanode have a saturated photocurrent of ∼14.3 mA cm−2. This is under the irradiation of AM1.5G simulated sunlight at 45 mW cm−2, which is greatly higher than ZnO/CdTe/CdSe, ZnO/CdSe or ZnO/CdTe nanocable arrays.
1. Introduction
Recently, semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) such as CdS,1–3 CdSe,4–8 CdTe,9–11 PbS,12–14 PbSe,15 InP,16 In2S317 and InAs18 have been intensively utilized as sensitizers of wide-gap photoanodes including ZnO and TiO2 in QD sensitized solar cells (QDSSC). In these QDSSCs, the band alignment between the QDs and photoanodes always follow a type-II mode, where both the valence and conduction bands of the QDs are higher in energy than those of the photoanodes.19–22 In these types of cells, the photogenerated electrons in the QDs inject into the wide band gap semiconductor, while the holes left behind in the QDs are reduced by the electrolyte used in the QDSSC. In one of the most promising configurations of QDSSCs, type-II core–shell nanocable arrays on a transparent conductive substrate (such as ITO (Indium Tin Oxide) and FTO (F doped Tin Dioxide)) not only provide a large interfacial area for the charge separation and carrier transfer along the shorter radial instead of the longer axial direction, but also greatly enhance the loading density of sensitizers while decreasing the nonradiative recombinations occurring at core–electrolyte and QD–QD interfaces. Furthermore, the crystalline 1D core electrodes can serve as an efficient and direct pathway for the transport of photogenerated carriers to ITO or FTO.23–25 Based on these advantages, a series of nanocable array photoanodes such as ZnO/CdS, ZnO/CdSSe, ZnO/CdSe, ZnO/In2S3, ZnO/ZnCdSe have been reported.17,26–29 For instance, a power efficiency as high as 4.74% and 3.65% was demonstrated in SCs using ZnO/CdSe and ZnO/Zn0.33Cd0.67Se nanocable arrays as the photoanode.27 We obtained ZnO/CdTe nanocable arrays with a photocurrent density of ∼5.9 mA cm−2via an electrochemical deposition method.9 Yong et al. fabricated ZnO/CdS nanocable arrays solar cell with conversion efficiency of 3.53% and short-circuit photocurrent density of 7.23 mA cm−2.30
On the other hand, co-sensitization with two kinds of narrow-gap semiconductors is an efficient way to increase the power efficiency of QDSSCs. Much effort has been expended on CdS/CdSe co-sensitized TiO2 films solar cells because of the wide absorption range of CdSe and the suitable energy level of CdS in comparison with TiO2.31–35 Energy level alignment at the CdS/CdSe interface differs greatly from that at the CdSe/CdS interface, which makes the TiO2/CdS/CdSe structure solar cell have a better performance than the reversed structure of TiO2/CdSe/CdS.36,37 Since a power efficiency of 4.22% and a saturated photocurrent of 14.9 mA cm−2 have been achieved in TiO2/CdS/CdSe solar cells, most researches are focused on CdS/CdSe co-sensitized systems.36 The co-sensitization of CdSe/CdTe on 1D ZnO or TiO2 photoanodes is less studied. Compared with CdS, CdSe and CdTe have wider absorption range due to the narrower band gap.38 Moreover, the conduction band edge of both CdSe and CdTe lies above that of ZnO, which makes it favorable in energy for the carrier injection from CdSe or CdTe to ZnO.39 Taking both the advantages of the co-sensitization method and a nanocable array photoanode, double-sheath nanocable arrays based on CdSe and CdTe nanoshells and ZnO nanowire cores are expected to be promising photoanodes for QDSSC.
In this work, using ZnO nanowire cores as electrodes and CdSe and CdTe nanoshells as sensitizers, double-shelled nanocable arrays were synthesized on ITO substrates by a two-step electrochemical deposition method. A contact interface was formed between the zinc-blende CdSe and CdTe of the ZnO/CdTe/CdSe and ZnO/CdSe/CdTe nanocable arrays. In comparison with the poor photoelectrochemical properties of the reversed structure, ZnO/CdSe/CdTe nanocable photoanodes show a saturated photocurrent as high as ∼14.3 mA cm−2 under the irradiation of AM1.5G simulated sunlight at 45 mW cm−2. As revealed by the detailed analysis on the interfacial energy alignment of CdSe/CdTe and CdTe/CdSe, a stepwise band alignment has been achieved among ZnO, CdSe and CdTe, which can greatly speed up the injection of the photoexcited electrons from CdTe and CdSe to ZnO.
2. Experimental
The preparation of double-shelled ZnO/CdSe/CdTe nanocable arrays includes three main steps. Firstly, ZnO nanorod arrays were hydrothermally grown on ZnO seed layers pre-synthesized on ITO substrate.40–42 To increase the crystal quality, the nanorods were annealed at 400 °C for 120 min. Secondly, CdSe (or CdTe) was electrodeposited onto ZnO nanorods by an electrochemical work station (CHI instrument, model 660D) with a three-electrode system at room temperature, forming a core–sheath ZnO/CdSe (or ZnO/CdTe) nanocable structure. The ZnO nanorod arrays-on-ITO, Pt foil and saturated Ag/AgCl electrode were respectively used as a working electrode, counter electrode and reference electrode. Lastly, CdTe (or CdSe) was electrodeposited onto the ZnO/CdSe (or ZnO/CdTe) nanocables, thus forming double-sheath ZnO/CdSe/CdTe (or ZnO/CdTe/CdSe) nanocable arrays. In the last electrodeposition process, the ZnO/CdSe (or ZnO/CdTe) nanocable arrays-on-ITO served as the working electrode while the counter electrode and reference electrode maintained unchanged. The electrolyte for the electrodeposition of CdSe was an aqueous solution composed of 0.0125 M cadmium acetate, 0.0125 M sodium selenosulphate (Na2SeSO3), 0.025 M nitrilotriacetic acid trisodium salt (NTA, C6H6NO6Na3). The electrolyte for the deposition of CdTe were composed of 0.005 M potassium tellurite (K2TeO3), 0.02 M cadmium acetate and 0.05 M NTA. The electrodeposition sequence of ZnO/CdTe/CdSe is just contrary to that of ZnO/CdSe/CdTe nanocables, while the electrolytes were kept the same. The deposition potential was fixed at −1.0 V versus Ag/AgCl electrode for both CdSe and CdTe. The final products were annealed at 350 °C for 60 min under an Ar atmosphere for protection.
The morphology, crystallinity and absorption properties of the samples were characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, JEOL, JSM-6700F), X-ray diffraction (XRD, D8 FOCUS X-ray diffraction) and UV-vis spectrophotometry (UV360), respectively. The microstructure and elemental composition of the double-sheath nanocables were studied using a (scanning) transmission microscope (STEM, TEM, Tecnai model 20 FEI) equipped with an energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDX). The photoelectrochemical property of the ZnO/CdTe/CdSe and ZnO/CdSe/CdTe nanocable arrays electrodes were studied using the same electrochemical working station under the irradiation of AM1.5G simulated sunlight at 45 mW cm−2, in which a saturated Ag/AgCl electrode and Pt foil were used as the reference and counter electrode, respectively. The electrolyte was a mixed solution of methanol and water (v/v = 7:3) of 0.6 M Na2S, 0.2 M S, 0.2 M KCl.
3. Results and discussion

Fig. 1a and b show the top-view and cross-sectional SEM images of the ZnO nanorod arrays on ITO. The ZnO nanorod arrays were nearly vertically aligned on the ITO, and have an average diameter and length of ∼65 nm and 2.5 μm (with a standard deviation of 10 nm), respectively. The hexagonal cross sections of the nanorods suggest that the ZnO nanorods have hexagonal structure with the axial direction aligned with c-axis. After deposition of CdSe (Fig. 1c), the ZnO nanorods were covered by a CdSe nanocrystal layer to form a core–sheath ZnO/CdSe nanocable structure. The diameter of the nanocable is estimated to ∼100 nm with a standard deviation of 10 nm, indicating a thickness of CdSe layer of ∼20 nm. Further electrodeposition of CdTe (Fig. 1d) induces a condensed layer on the surface of CdSe, thus forming a double-sheath ZnO/CdSe/CdTe nanocable array on ITO. The average diameter of the double-shell nanocables is ∼130 nm, suggesting the CdTe shell has a thickness of ∼15 nm. In contrast, the evolution from ZnO to ZnO/CdTe then to ZnO/CdTe/CdSe nanocable arrays is shown in the ESI.† The thickness of CdTe and CdSe in the reverse structure, double-sheath ZnO/CdTe/CdSe nanocables, was kept the same as that of the ZnO/CdSe/CdTe nanocables.

Fig. 2 reveals the XRD spectra taken from ZnO/CdSe (plot a), ZnO/CdTe/CdSe (plot b) and ZnO/CdSe/CdTe nanocable arrays (plot c). For all three samples, the diffraction peaks marked by crosses and asterisks arise from ITO and wurtzite ZnO nanorods (JCPDS file no. 89-1397), respectively. For ZnO/CdSe nanocable arrays, three more peaks can be observed at 25.3°, 42.0°, 49.7°, which can be indexed to (111), (220), and (311) planes of zinc-blende (ZB) CdSe (JCPDS file no. 88-2346), respectively. For ZnO/CdSe/CdTe nanocable arrays, three peaks emerged at 24.4°, 28.2°, 40.3°, which well corresponds to the (111), (200), and (220) planes of the zinc-blende CdTe (JCPDS file no. 89-3011), respectively. Similar diffraction peaks of CdTe and CdSe can be found for ZnO/CdTe/CdSe nanocables, suggesting that the electrodeposition sequence has little effect on the crystallinity of the CdSe and CdTe layer. Though the diffraction intensity of CdTe and CdSe is much less than that of ZnO due to the limited thickness of the nanoshell layer, the diffraction peaks are very sharp, which strongly indicates the good crystal quality of the double-sheath ZnO/CdTe/CdSe and ZnO/CdSe/CdTe nanocables. No impurity diffraction peaks including CdSeTe alloy or CdO have been detected, excluding possible oxidation or alloying of CdSe and CdTe during the annealing process.

To further confirm the microstructure of the ZnO/CdSe/CdTe nanocable arrays, TEM-related measurements were carried out. As revealed by the low-magnification TEM images (Fig. 3a and c), the ZnO nanorod core was coated by uniform and compact shells with total thickness of ∼32 nm. The corresponding EDX elemental profile (Fig. 3b) identifies that the ZnO cores were covered by CdSe and CdTe nanoshells successively along the radial direction of the ZnO/CdSe/CdTe nanocable. The thickness of CdSe and CdTe can be estimated as ∼17 nm and ∼15 nm, respectively. In contrary with the sharp interface between ZnO and CdSe, the interface of CdSe and CdTe is less obvious in the low magnification range due to the similar crystal structure (aCdSe: 6.077 Å, aCdTe: 6.480 Å). Fig. 3d is a typical high-resolution TEM image, the d-spacing of the lattice fringes in the CdTe and CdSe nanoshells is estimated to be ∼0.37 nm and ∼0.35 nm, respectively, matching well with the (111) planes of ZB CdTe and CdSe. When considering the thickness of CdSe and CdTe nanoshells, a clear CdSe/CdTe interface can be observed in Fig. 3d. Though both CdSe and CdTe grow in random directions with each other, their interface is very compact and continuous, which is very important for the photogenerated carrier transfer along the radial direction of the nanoshells. Based on tens of HRTEM images taken from different regions of nanocables, the CdTe and CdSe nanocrystals have an average size range of 10–20 nm and 7–15 nm, respectively. That is to say, the number of the grain boundaries in the CdSe and CdTe nanoshell layer is not higher than two along the radial orientation of the nanocables, which would be greatly beneficial for suppression of carrier nonradiative recombinations and enhancement of the photoelectrochemical properties.

The optical absorption spectra of pure ZnO nanorods, ZnO/CdSe, ZnO/CdTe, ZnO/CdTe/CdSe and ZnO/CdSe/CdTe nanocable arrays are shown in Fig. 4. The pure ZnO nanorod arrays have an absorption edge at 380 nm. After being coated by a single CdSe and CdTe nanoshell, the absorption edge redshifts to ∼680 nm and ∼850 nm, respectively, being consistent with the band gap of the bulk counterparts (Eg,CdTe: 1.61 eV, Eg,CdSe: 1.76 eV). When the CdTe nanoshell was coated on the ZnO/CdSe nanocables, the absorption edge shifts from ∼680 nm to ∼800 nm, while an obvious blue shift from 850 nm to 700 nm occurs when ZnO/CdTe nanocables were covered by a CdSe layer. For both the double-shelled ZnO/CdSe/CdTe and ZnO/CdTe/CdSe nanocable arrays, the absorption edge is consistent with the band gaps of the outer nanoshell, which suggests that the ZnO/CdSe/CdTe nanocable arrays have better absorption properties than the reverse structure.

The photoelectrochemical properties were further demonstrated using the above single- and double-shelled nanocable arrays on ITO as photoanodes. Fig. 5 shows the current density–potential (J–V) characteristics of the above PEC cells under the irradiation of AM1.5G simulated sunlight at 45 mW cm−2. The saturated current density of single-shelled ZnO/CdSe and ZnO/CdTe nanocable arrays is ∼6.1 and ∼9.7 mA cm−2, respectively. The better performance of ZnO/CdTe over ZnO/CdSe originates from the expanded absorption spectrum over the sunlight. In comparison with single-shelled nanocables, the double-shelled ZnO/CdSe/CdTe nanocable photoanode shows the best photocurrent density of ∼14.3 mA cm−2. On the other hand, the photocurrent density is as small as ∼6.9 mA cm−2 for the reverse structure of ZnO/CdTe/CdSe electrode, lower than that of both ZnO/CdSe/CdTe and ZnO/CdTe nanocables.

The difference of the photoelectrochemical performances can be attributed to the band alignment variation between ZnO with the different shells and their assembly. Here, the J–V curves obtained in the dark for the above nanocables are given in Fig. 6. The current response of these electrodes at positive bias increases in the order: ZnO/CdSe < ZnO/CdTe/CdSe < ZnO/CdTe < ZnO/CdSe/CdTe, suggesting that ZnO/CdSe/CdTe has a superior band edge structure more favorable for charge transfer than the equivalent single-shelled structure, while the reverse structure, ZnO/CdTe/CdSe, has a much higher resistance even than ZnO/CdTe. The result also implies that a stepwise conduction band edge has been constructed in the ZnO/CdSe/CdTe nanocable arrays.

Indeed, the conduction band alignment at CdSe/CdTe interface can be deduced from the band offset of the bulk material and the interfacial Fermi level (Ef) shift. After the contact of CdSe and CdTe, their Fermi level will be flattened, which will cause the downward and upward shift of the band edges respectively for CdSe and CdTe. Then, the position of the flattened conduction minimum ΔEc′ can be calculated by ΔEc′ = ΔEc − ΔEf, where ΔEc is the unstrained conduction band offset between cubic CdSe and CdTe before contact, which was reported as ∼0.42 eV (as shown in Fig. 7a and c),38 and ΔEf is the shift of Fermi level after the contacting of CdSe and CdTe. For our double-shelled nanocables, ΔEf is the difference between the Ef of the double- and single-shelled nanocables, namely, ΔEf1 and ΔEf2. For example, for ZnO/CdSe/CdTe nanocables, ΔEf1 = Ef(ZnO/CdSe/CdTe) − Ef(ZnO/CdTe) and ΔEf2 = Ef(ZnO/CdSe) − Ef(ZnO/CdSe/CdTe). Since the Fermi level of a semiconductor and solution will be identical once reaching electrostatic equilibrium when the semiconductor surface is exposed to a redox solution,43 the equilibrium Fermi level of an electrode is equivalent to its open circuit potential (OCP) value, which can be evaluated from Fig. 6. In this way, the equilibrium Ef of the ZnO/CdSe, ZnO/CdTe, ZnO/CdTe/CdSe, ZnO/CdSe/CdTe nanocables are −0.52, −0.78, −0.61 and −0.54 eV versus Ag/AgCl, respectively. Then, ΔEf and ΔEc′ can be calculated as 0.26 eV and 0.16 eV, respectively, which has been illustrated in Fig. 7b. Consequently, combined with the reported type II band alignment between CdSe and ZnO,39 a stepwise band edge structure is successfully realized in ZnO, CdSe and CdTe in the ZnO/CdSe/CdTe nanocable photoelectrodes. Such an energy alignment allows for the efficient injection of the photoexcited electrons from CdTe or CdSe to ZnO and holes from CdSe or CdTe to the redox solution, making the photocurrent of ZnO/CdSe/CdTe much higher than ZnO/CdSe and ZnO/CdTe nanocable arrays. Together with the good absorption property and the double-shelled nanocable structure, the ZnO/CdSe/CdTe nanocable array photoanode presents an excellent photoelectrochemical performance.

Similarly, for ZnO/CdTe/CdSe nanocable arrays, ΔEf1 = Ef(ZnO/CdTe/CdSe) − Ef(ZnO/CdTe), and ΔEf2 = Ef(ZnO/CdSe) − Ef(ZnO/CdSe/CdTe), then ΔEf of 0.26 eV and the strained nature conduction band offset ΔEc′ of −0.16 eV can be obtained as shown in Fig. 7d. The negative value suggests that the band edge of the second shell lies bellow the first one, which greatly differs from the positive value calculated for the ZnO/CdSe/CdTe nanocable structure. Though the energy alignment at ZnO/CdTe interface is energetic favorable for the electrons injection from CdTe to ZnO,39 the outer CdSe nanoshell forms an energy barrier for the transport of holes to CdSe, thus leads to the lower photocurrent of ZnO/CdTe/CdSe than ZnO/CdTe nanocable arrays. Additionally, both the conduction and valence level of CdTe locate above those of CdSe, which make the CdTe shell an energy barrier for the transport of electrons from CdSe to ZnO, thus greatly degrades the photoelectrochemical property.
4. Conclusion
High-density ZnO/CdSe/CdTe and ZnO/CdTe/CdSe nanocable arrays have been synthesized by simply changing the sequence of the electrochemical deposition of CdSe and CdTe. The dense CdSe and CdTe nanoshells, with zinc-blende structure and respective thickness of 17 nm and 15 nm, form a compact and continuous interface for the photoexcited carriers to transfer. The saturated photocurrent response of ZnO/CdSe/CdTe nanocable arrays is as high as ∼14.3 mA cm−2, and decreases in the order of ZnO/CdSe/CdTe > ZnO/CdTe > ZnO/CdTe/CdSe > ZnO/CdSe. A stepwise band alignment among ZnO, CdSe and CdTe has been demonstrated for ZnO/CdSe/CdTe nanocables, which greatly speeds up the transfer rate of photoexcited electrons from CdTe to ZnO via the CdSe/CdTe interface. The poor photoelectrochemical property of the ZnO/CdTe/CdSe nanocables is related to the adverse energy alignment between CdTe and CdSe with lower conduction band edge of CdSe in comparison with CdTe.
