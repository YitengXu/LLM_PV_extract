[Cr(ttpy)2]3+ (ttpy = 4′-(4-methylphenyl)-2,2′:6,2′′-terpyridine) exhibits rich electrochemical and photophysical properties. Cyclic voltammetry performed in CH3CN shows in the cathodic part the presence of three one-electron reversible systems at −0.47, −0.85 and −1.35 V vs. Ag/AgNO3 10−2 M. These systems are attributed to the reduction of the terpyridine ligands with a partial delocalization of the charge on the tolyl for the last reduction event. The three different reduced species were generated by exhaustive electrolysis and characterized by EPR and UV-visible spectroscopy; DFT calculations were performed to locate the spin density of the electrons added during the reduction. Visible light irradiation of [Cr(ttpy)2]3+ induces the population of a luminescent metal-centered excited state with a lifetime of 270 ns in deoxygenated CH3CN. This excited state can be quenched by an electron transfer process with triphenylphosphine (PPh3) or triethanolamine (TEOA). Using TEOA as a sacrificial electron donor, the doubly reduced species (i.e.[Cr(ttpy)2] +) can be generated under continuous irradiation. In the presence of [Ru(bpy)3]2+ as an additional photosensitizer, the photoreduction of [Cr(ttpy)2]3+ towards [Cr(ttpy)2]+ is accelerated. The trinuclear [{RuII(bpy)2(bpy-O-tpy)}2CrIII]7+ complex ([Ru2Cr]7+) in which a CrIII-bis-terpyridine centre is covalently linked to two RuII-tris-bipyridine moieties by oxo bridges has been synthesised. Its electrochemical, photophysical and photochemical properties were investigated in deoxygenated CH3CN. Cyclic voltammetry indicates only a poor electronic communication between the different subunits, whereas luminescence experiments show a strong quenching of the RuII* excited state by an intramolecular process. Continuous irradiation of [Ru2Cr]7+ under visible conditions in the presence of TEOA leads to [Ru2Cr]4+ where three electrons are stored on the [Cr(ttpy)] subunit.
Introduction
In the search for sustainable energy, Nature's photosynthetic machinery offers valuable guidelines for the efficient solar to chemical energy conversion in which light absorption is notably followed by: (1) sequential electron transfers between electron acceptors and electron donors, leading to a charge separated state, (2) charge accumulation on a specific redox center and (3) light driven multi-electron catalysis. Since the first example of a charge accumulation system containing a Ru(II) photosensitizer, developed by K. Brewer et al.,1 intense research has been carried out in order to master electron collection on a distinct molecular component.2–7 However, molecular systems able to collect more than two electrons are rare,3,8 because of a multitude of deactivation pathways before the charge accumulation or degradation process of highly reduced or oxidized species. In the examples mentioned above, the molecular systems are built around a [Ru(bpy)3]2+ (bpy = 2,2′-bipyridine) photosensitive unit linked to specific sites acting as an electron storage or reservoir. Indeed [Ru(bpy)3]2+ exhibits remarkable electrochemical and photophysical properties mainly due to the population, under visible light, of a triplet metal to ligand charge transfer excited state (3MLCT) with a long lifetime (around 800 ns in O2-free acetonitrile).9 Moreover, the [Ru(bpy)3]2+ unit can be incorporated into linear assemblies to obtain well-ordered electron donor–photosensitizer–electron acceptor assemblies, by disubstitution on the 5,5′ position of one of the bipyridine ligands.10,11 A pentad was notably prepared, by the group of O. Wenger, around a central anthraquinone linked to two [Ru(bpy)3]2+ subunits with terminal triarylamine. Upon visible light irradiation, a noteworthy long lived charge separated state of 870 ns for the two electron accumulation on the anthraquinone unit is obtained in neat CH3CN.12 In the presence of a proton source, the lifetime is prolonged to 4.7 μs due to the formation of the hydroquinone form through a two proton-coupled two electron transfer process upon visible light irradiation.13
Linear assemblies are easily obtained with a tridentate 2,2′:6′,2′′-terpyridine (tpy) ligand that can be substituted in the 4′ position and associated with a metallic center. Because [Ru(tpy)2]2+ exhibits a very short emission lifetime (250 ps) at room temperature which limits its use in photoredox chemistry, research in the early 2000 investigated the Ir(III) parent system. The model complex [Ir(tpy)2]3+ exhibits emission properties at room temperature attributed to the radiative deactivation of a ligand centered (3LC) excited state with a lifetime of around 1 μs.14
Cr(III) bis-terpyridine complexes and their derivatives have been much less investigated as redox photosensitizers,15,16 or as part of photonic devices,17 despite the fact that they are a more abundant and cheaper metal. A major concern for the use of chromium is its toxicity, but it highly depends on the metal oxidation state.18 If Cr(VI) is a human carcinogen, Cr(III) is almost not toxic and can then be used for sustainable development in solar energy conversion and storage. [Cr(tpy)2]3+ exhibits a weak emission due to a MC state with a lifetime estimated around 140 ns.19 Its electrochemistry was first studied in the 1970s by Hughes and Macero20,21 and more recently reinvestigated by Wieghardt et al.22 In the cathodic part, the complex is able to reversibly exchange up to four electrons. These reduction events are localized on the terpyridine ligands whereas the chromium remains in its 3+ oxidation state. Its rich electrochemical properties inspired researchers to test it in multi-electronic catalytic reactions. For instance, Abruna and co-workers electropolymerized [Cr(vtpy)2]3+ (vtpy = 4′-vinyl-2,2′:6′,2′′-terpyridine) on a carbon electrode, and then used it for the electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 in water to produce formaldehyde with a remarkable faradaic efficiency of 87% at relatively low overpotential.23 Surprisingly, the ability of [Cr(tpy)2]3+* to exchange multiple electrons under light irradiation and to be engaged in photocatalytic processes has not been further explored. Recently Constable and Housecroft have developed a new chemical route leading to heteroleptic complexes of Cr(III) containing a terpyridine based ligand.24,25 This strategy based on a [Cr(tpy)(CF3SO3)3] intermediate species opens access to the synthesis of new molecular assemblies, where Cr(III) could be incorporated between electron donor and acceptor subunits. In this context we decided firstly to study the photoinduced reduction processes of [Cr(ttpy)2]3+ (ttpy = 4′-(4-methylphenyl)-2,2′:6,2′′-terpyridine) in the presence of two sacrificial electron donors having different oxidation potential:triphenylphosphine (PPh3, Epa = 0.91 V. vs. Ag/AgNO3) or triethanolamine (TEOA, Epa = 0.46 V. vs. Ag/AgNO3), with the aim to store more than 1 electron on the complex. The kinetics and efficiency of the reduction processes were also investigated in the presence of [Ru(bpy)3]2+ added into solution as an additional photosensitizer.
Recently, ditopic ligands bearing a [Ru(bpy)3]2+ photoactive core and a terpyridine motif have become a popular approach to study photo-induced processes between [Ru(bpy)3]2+* and the terpyridyl complexes of first raw transition metals.26–29 We have previously reported a [Ru(bpy)3]2+ photosensitizer bearing either one or two terpyridine unit(s) via phenol bridges, and associated it with Co(III) and Fe(II) ions in order to obtain a trimetallic triad.30,31 This ditopic ligand can hence be used in order to access trinuclear assemblies bearing both Ru(II) and Cr(III) subunits namely [Ru2Cr]7+ (Scheme 1). Herein, we also report a detailed study on the electrochemical and photophysical properties of [Ru2Cr]7+ and its photoredox behavior in the presence of TEOA under visible light irradiation. In this trimetallic system, the [Cr(ttpy)2]3+ center acts as an electron storage unit whereas the [Ru(bpy)3]2+ centers play the role of a light absorbing unit.

General materials
Acetonitrile (CH3CN, Rathburn, HPLC grade), diethyl ether (Et2O, Aldrich 99.8%), ethanol (C2H5OH, SDS anhydrous, analytical grade), and methanol (CH3OH, SDS anhydrous, analytical grade), CrCl2 (Strem 99.9%), n-butyl ammonium tetrafluoroborate ([Bu4N]BF4, Fluka 99%) and tetra-n-butyl ammonium hexafluorphosphate ([Bu4N]PF6, Aldrich 99%) were used as received and stored under argon in a dry glovebox (Jaram). Triethanolamine (TEOA), triphenylphosphine (PPh3) and other chemical reagents used in the synthetic route were obtained from commercial sources as guaranteed-grade reagents and used without further purification. Syntheses of air sensitive complexes were performed in a glovebox (Jaram). [Ru(bpy)2(bpy-O-tpy)]·2PF6 (ML) was synthesized according to a previously described procedure.30
Synthesis of [Cr(ttpy)2]3+
A 5 mL degassed water solution of CrCl2 (32 mg, 0.26 mmol) was added to a suspension of 4′-(4-methylphenyl)-2,2′:6,2′′-terpyridine (250 mg, 0.77 mmol) in 50 mL of degassed H2O in a glovebox. Few drops of degassed ethanol were added accompanied by the formation of a purple color. The solution was left to stir for 1 h at 25 °C. Addition of LiClO4 led to the precipitation of [Cr(ttpy)2]2+ as a purple powder. Bubbling oxygen for 30 minutes to the suspension led to the formation of a yellow precipitate, which was filtered and recrystallized from a mixture of EtOH/H2O (50:50) to yield [Cr(ttpy)2]3+ as a yellow-orange solid (130 mg, 0.16 mmol) (60%). Elemental analysis calc. for C44H34Cl3CrN6O12 (995.07 g mol−1): C, 53.00; H, 3.44; N, 8.43. Found: C, 52.17, H, 3.73, N, 8.64%. ESI-MS: m/z 896.08 [M − ClO4]+; 398.52 [M − 2ClO4]2+; 232.67 [M − 3ClO4]3+.
Synthesis of {[Ru(bpy)2(bpy-O-tpy)]2Cr}7+ ([Ru2Cr]7+)
Metallo-ligand ML (80 mg, 0.06 mmol) and CrCl2 (4 mg, 0.03 mmol) were refluxed in 20 mL of degassed MeOH for 4 h in a glovebox. Addition of NH4PF6 led to the formation of a brown precipitate which was filtered and recrystallized from a mixture of CH3CN/Et2O yielding [Ru2Cr]6+ (57 mg, 0.021 mmol) 70%. The latter is then oxidized in an electrochemical cell by exhaustive electrolysis with an applied potential of 0 V vs. Ag/AgNO3 (10−2 M) in CH3CN + 0.1 M of [Bu4N]ClO4 generating [Ru2Cr]7+ in quantitative yields. Redox potentials and UV-visible characterization are given in Tables 1 and 2, respectively.

Electrochemistry
Electrochemical measurements were performed under argon in a dry glovebox at room temperature using an EG&G PAR model 173 potentiostat/galvanostat equipped with a PAR model universal programmer 175 and a PAR model 179 digital coulometer. A standard three electrode electrochemical cell was used. Potentials were referenced to an Ag/AgNO3 (10−2 M) reference electrode in CH3CN + 0.1 M [Bu4N]ClO4. Potentials referred to that system can be converted to the ferrocene/ferrocenium couple by subtracting 87 mV and to the SCE or NHE by adding 298 mV or 548 mV, respectively. The working electrode was a 3 mm diameter vitreous carbon electrode polished with 2 mm diamond paste (Mecaprex Presi). The rotating disk electrode (RDE) was a 3 mm diameter carbon disk with a rotation rate ω = 600 rot min−1.
Absorption and emission
Absorption spectra were obtained using a Zeiss spectrophotometer (MCS 501 UV-NIR) and a 1 cm path length quartz cell. Emission spectra were recorded in deoxygenated solvents at room temperature using a Fluoromax 4 (Horiba). Emission quantum yields Φem were determined at 25 °C in deoxygenated acetonitrile solutions with [Ru(bpy)3]·2Cl in H2O (Φem = 0.028) as a standard, using an optically dilute methodology.32 Emission lifetime measurements were performed after irradiation at 400 nm with a picosecond Ti:Sapphire laser and using a time correlated single photon counting detector (PicoHarp 300) or after irradiation at 532 nm using a nanosecond Nd:YAG laser (quantel brilliant) and the detector from LP 920 Edinburgh instruments. Flash photolysis experiments were carried out using a LP 920 transient absorption system from Edinburgh instruments. The uncertainties are λ (±2 nm); τ (5%), Φ (20%), and ε (20%).
DFT methodology
All DFT calculations have been performed with the ADF (Amsterdam Density Functional) code developed by E. J. Baerends and co-workers.33 Triple-zeta (TZ2P) basis sets have been used throughout. All geometry optimizations of [Cr(ttpy)2]n+ (from n = 3 to −1) have been performed in vacuo (gas phase) relying on both the Generalized Gradient Approximation (GGA) VBP exchange–correlation (XC) potential (VWN + BP: Vosko, Wilk & Nusair34 + corrective terms by Becke35 for the exchange, and Perdew36 for the correlation) and the B3LYP37,38 XC potential (i.e. 20% of pure Hartree–Fock exchange), all with ADF grid precision 6.
The previous geometry-optimized complexes have been moreover imbedded in an implicit/continuous solvent (i.e. acetonitrile) via the COSMO (COnductor-like Screening MOdel)39–41 module for the computation at both GGA and B3LYP levels of the four successive one-electron reduction processes (see details in the ESI†).
We also computed g-tensors for both [Cr(ttpy)2]3+ and [Cr(ttpy)2]+ at the GGA XC level (triple-zeta basis sets TZ2P). We turned on the (two-components) relativistic option, at the scalar42 ZORA (Zero Order Regular Approximation)43,44–47 level to generate the proper electronic structures. Calculations were then completed by using the independent “nmr” subroutine providing the g-tensors from TAPE10 files previously generated.
EPR
Continuous wave EPR experiments were performed using a Bruker EMX spectrometer operating at X-band frequency with an ER-4116 dual mode cavity and an Oxford Instruments ESR-900 flow cryostat. Typical settings for [Cr(ttpy)2]+ samples include 20 K temperature, 9.655 GHz frequency, 0.02 mW power, 2 G modulation amplitude, and 1 hour acquisition time. For [Cr(ttpy)2]3+ samples the settings include 10 K temperature, 9.655 GHz frequency, 20 mW power, 10 G modulation amplitude, and 1 hour acquisition time. EPR spectra were simulated by using the Easyspin software developed by Stoll et al.48
Continuous irradiation
Photoinduced transformations were performed using a Xenon lamp (150 W, Hamamatsu L9588) operated at 40% of its maximum energy and using a UV heatbuster filter (Melles Griot. 03MHG101, irradiation between 400 and 700 nm). The photon flux is estimated to be 5 × 1015 photon per s via actinometry measurements using the ferrioxalate reference system. For these experiments, all the solutions were prepared in a dry-glovebox under argon in a 1 cm path length quartz cuvette. The solutions contained a mixture of the complexes (0.05 mM) with TEOA or PPh3 (15 mM) in CH3CN. Under these conditions, the concentration of the sacrificial donor can be considered constant during the irradiation experiments. Photoinduced reductions were followed by UV–Visible spectroscopy.
Results and discussion
Synthesis
The synthesis of the polypyridyl complexes of Cr(III) is well documented in the literature.16,24,49[Cr(ttpy)2]3+ involves the direct complexation of CrCl2 with terpyridine ligands in a mixture of water and ethanol under argon leading to the formation of a [Cr(ttpy)2]2+ complex as a first step. Precipitation by addition of LiClO4 is an important step prior to oxidation.50 The resulting suspension is oxidized by oxygen leading to the isolation of [Cr(ttpy)2]3+ as a yellow-orange solid. The metallo-ligand ML was prepared in good yields following a previously described procedure30via a clean Williamson substitution reaction between 4′-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-2,2′:6,2′′-terpyridine51 and the brominated ruthenium precursor [Ru(bpy)2(5-bromo-bpy)](PF6)230 in the presence of K2CO3 in CH3CN. The latter complex was characterized by 1H NMR, 13C NMR spectroscopy and ESI mass spectrometry. When one molar equivalent of CrCl2 was refluxed in a degassed methanol solution containing two molar equivalents of ML, the trinuclear complex {[Ru(bpy)2(bpy-O-tpy)]2Cr}6+[Ru2Cr]6+ was isolated as a brown solid. Attempts to isolate [Ru2Cr]7+ in its pure form by chemical oxidation failed. Instead solutions of [Ru2Cr]7+ for photophysical and photochemical experiments were obtained by exhaustive electrolysis of [Ru2Cr]6+ solution in deoxygenated CH3CN + 0.1 M [Bu4N]ClO4 carried out at 0.0 V vs. Ag/AgNO3 (10−2 M). The quantitative formation of [Ru2Cr]7+ was checked by electrochemistry and UV–Visible spectra recorded after electrolysis.
Spectroelectrochemistry
The redox potentials of ML, [Cr(ttpy)2]3+ and [Ru2Cr]7+ are collected in Table 1. The cyclic voltammograms (CVs) are shown in Fig. 1. ML exhibits in the positive potential region, a reversible oxidation process at 1.01 V attributed to the one electron oxidation of the metal center RuIII/RuII and in the negative potential region, four mono-electronic processes (Fig. 1A). The three reduction events at E1/2 = −1.63, −1.85 and −2.07 V are assigned to the mono-electronic reduction of three bipyridines,9 while the last reduction event at −2.36 V is attributed to the reduction of the terpyridine unit.29 The absorption spectrum of ML displays the typical signatures of the [Ru(bpy)3]2+ core and is dominated by LC transition (π → π*) in the UV region reaching a maximum at 280 nm, as well as the MLCT band (dπ6 → dπ5π*) in the visible region with a maximum at 445 nm (Fig. S1†).52

The CV of [Cr(ttpy)2]3+ shows a series of one-electron reversible reductions with E1/2 = −0.47, −0.85, −1.35 and −2.25 V (Fig. 1B). Few investigations have probed the electrochemical properties of the Cr(III) bis-terpyridine based complexes.21 A recent study on [Cr(tpy)2]3+ has shown that the terpyridine coordinated ligands are the redox active units while the chromium metallic center is maintained in the Cr(III) form.22 We have then investigated the electrochemical and spectroscopic fingerprints of the first four oxidation states of the [Cr(ttpy)2]n+ complexes (n = 3, 2, 1, 0). As such, the complexes were generated in situ by exhaustive electrolysis of a solution of [Cr(ttpy)2]3+ in CH3CN. The quantitative reduction was verified by Rotating Disc Electrode (RDE) voltammograms (Fig. S2†). It is notable to mention that different solubility profiles were detected for [Cr(ttpy)2]n+ in CH3CN depending on the counter anion and the degree of oxidation ([Cr(ttpy)2]3+, [Cr(ttpy)2]2+ and [Cr(ttpy)2]+ were soluble in the form of BF4− and [Cr(ttpy)2]0 was soluble in the form of ClO4−). Thus, we have recorded the CV and the absorption spectra of the [Cr(ttpy)2]n+ complexes in CH3CN in the presence of two different supporting electrolytes [Bu4N]BF4 and [Bu4N]ClO4. Sequential exhaustive electrolysis of [Cr(ttpy)2]3+ at −0.65, −1.0 and −1.7 V leads to the consumption of a total of three electrons (coulometric measurements) and to the consecutive formation of [Cr(ttpy)2]2+, [Cr(ttpy)2]+ and [Cr(ttpy)2]0. These reduction processes were accompanied by significant changes in the UV-Vis absorption spectra (Fig. 2). The initial yellow-orange solution of [Cr(ttpy)2]3+ in CH3CN displays an intense absorption peak in the UV region at 366 nm (ε = 45500 M−1 cm−1) attributed to the ILCT (intra ligand charge transfer) transition, along with lower energy transitions at 440 nm (ε = 4200 M−1 cm−1) and 475 nm (ε = 1900 M−1 cm−1). The formation of the [Cr(ttpy)2]2+ species was associated with the rapid disappearance of the absorption in the UV part of the spectrum with the concomitant emergence of new bands in the visible region at 486 nm (7000 M−1 cm−1) and 570 nm (2300 M−1 cm−1) and a low energy transition around 805 nm (2000 M−1 cm−1). Further reduction to [Cr(ttpy)2]+ leads to the growth of three intense bands in the visible region at 520 nm (19500 M−1 cm−1), 560 nm (20000 M−1 cm−1) and 723 nm (4500 M−1 cm−1). Finally [Cr(ttpy)2]0 was generated in a solution of CH3CN + 0.1 M [Bu4N]ClO4 due to solubility issues as discussed earlier, and was escorted by the significant increase of absorption in the whole visible part of the spectrum reaching maxima at 520, 571 and 670 nm.

The CV of [Ru2Cr]7+ is the superimposition of the electroactivity of ML and [Cr(ttpy)2]3+ (Fig. 1C). In the positive region, a reversible redox system is observed with E1/2 = 1.01 V. This redox event appears at an identical potential to the oxidation of the RuII center in ML hence indicating a weak electronic coupling between the different metallic subunits linked by the ether bridge. RDE experiments confirm that the trinuclear complex is obtained in a pure form and that no dissociation occurs in CH3CN, since the height of the RuIII/RuII wave is two times higher than that of chromium reduction waves in accordance with the 2:1 Ru/Cr stoichiometry (Fig. S3†). In the negative potential region, four reversible reduction waves were recorded. The first three ones, with E1/2 at −0.37, −0.73 and −1.23 V, are attributed to the three successive one-electron reductions of the [Cr(ttpy)2]3+ subunit. The fourth one at −1.54 V corresponds to the reduction of a bipyridine ligand on each [Ru(bpy)3]2+ core. At more negative potentials, the waves were distorted by some electroprecipitation/redissolution phenomenon and could not be assigned. The different reduced forms of the trinuclear complex denoted by [Ru2Cr]n+, (n = 7, 6, 5, 4) were generated in situ by exhaustive electrolysis of a solution of [Ru2Cr]7+ in CH3CN + 0.1 M [Bu4N]ClO4 and characterized by UV-visible absorption spectroscopy (Fig. 3). The absorption spectrum of [Ru2Cr]7+ is essentially the superimposition of absorption spectra of individual complexes in their respective ratio (Ru:Cr = 2:1) (Table 2). It is mainly characterized by strong LC (π → π*) transitions in the UV region and the [Ru(bpy)3]2+ MLCT band at 445 nm in the visible region. Exhaustive electrolysis conducted at −0.7 V consumed a total of one electron and led to the formation of [Ru2Cr]6+ which is characterized by a low energy transition at 800 nm in accordance with the formation of a [Cr(ttpy)2]2+ core (Fig. 2, curve b). Further electrolysis at −1.0 V was accompanied by an exchange of one extra electron generating [Ru2Cr]5+, shown by the disappearance of the band at 800 nm along with the emergence of several absorption bands in the visible region reaching maxima at 527, 570 and 720 nm. This is all in accordance with the net reduction of the [Cr(ttpy)2]2+ core to [Cr(ttpy)2]+ (Fig. 2, curve c). Further electrolysis at −1.3 V leads to the consumption of an extra electron with a significant increase of the absorption in the visible region with maxima at 520, 571, 670 and 760 nm which correspond to the typical transitions of [Cr(ttpy)2]0. Applying a potential of 0 V leads to the loss of three electrons regenerating [Ru2Cr]7+ in quantitative amounts, thus confirming the total reversibility of redox properties of the [Cr(ttpy)2]3+ unit in the [Ru2Cr]7+ complex. EPR spectroscopy and DFT calculations were carried out, in order to characterize the reduced forms of [Cr(ttpy)2]3+ and to confirm the localization of the spin density of the added electrons.

EPR spectroscopy and DFT calculation on [Cr(ttpy)2]n+
The EPR spectra of [Cr(ttpy)2]3+ and [Cr(ttpy)2]+ were recorded in acetonitrile frozen solution and are reported in Fig. 4A and B (resp.). [Cr(ttpy)2]2+ is EPR silent. The main features of the EPR spectrum of [Cr(ttpy)2]3+ could be approximately simulated by using an isotropic g tensor (g = 1.95) and zero field splitting parameters (D = 0.17 cm−1, E = 0.03 cm−1), which are very close to those reported by Casellato et al.53 for the [Cr(tpy)2]3+ complex (g = 1.95, D = 0.16 cm−1, E < 0.035 cm−1). It should be mentioned that Casellato et al. also observed very broad and poorly resolved spectra for [Cr(tpy)2]3+ in diluted solution and could obtain a better resolved spectrum only for [Cr(tpy)2]3+ as a dopant in crystals of the analogous Co3+ complex. The EPR spectrum of [Cr(ttpy)2]+ could be very well simulated with an axial g tensor g = [2.0435 2.0435 1.9570]. This tensor is in very good agreement with the DFT computations performed for this complex (see below), which yielded a g tensor ([2.054 2.054 1.968]) with exactly the same anisotropy and a small systematic shift (by 0.011 ± 0.0005). When comparing the g tensor measured for [Cr(ttpy)2]+ with the values measured by Wieghardt et al.22 for [Cr(tpy)2]+ (g = [2.0537 2.0471 1.9603]), the main difference is the strict axial symmetry of the g tensor we observed for [Cr(ttpy)2]+.
 Fig. 4  EPR spectra: [Cr(ttpy)2]3+ in CH3CN recorded at 10 K, simulation parameters: g = [1.95 1.95 1.95], D = −0.17 cm−1, E = −0.03 cm−1, Gaussian linewidth = 50 G, Dstrain = 1000 MHz (A); [Cr(ttpy)2]+ in CH3CN recorded at 20 K, simulation parameters: g = [2.0435 2.0435 1.9570], linewidth = 18 G (Gaussian) + 5 G (Lorentzian) (B). 
We investigated by DFT the electronic structures of the [Cr(ttpy)2]n+ complexes (n = 3 → −1) and computed as well the four redox potentials upon successive reduction (experimental values: −0.47, −0.85, −1.35 and −2.25 V versus Ag/AgNO3, respectively). The results are detailed in the ESI and gathered in Tables S1 and S2† relaying on the GGA XC level and B3LYP XC level potential respectively. First, the experimental redox potentials are very well reproduced, especially at the GGA level with a (determination coefficient) R2 value of 0.999 (0.967 with B3LYP; see Fig. S7†). As for the electronic structures, we report in Table S2† a charge and spin population analysis at the B3LYP level, as carried out elsewhere by Wieghardt et al. (an equivalent analysis at the GGA level – not discussed here – is found in Table S1†). It can be seen in Table S2† that: (i) the metal charge is nearly constant (between 1.23 and 1.34) upon successive reductions, indicating that the ligands accommodate the charge changes; (ii) this is confirmed by the fact that the (beta) metal spin population is also nearly constant for n = 2, 1, 0, (−1): see Scheme S1;† (iii) this is also confirmed by the localization of the respective HOMO (Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital) receiving these additional electrons. In Fig. 5 are represented some of these orbitals. For n = 2 (first reduction) and n = 1 (second reduction), the MO electron spin density stays localized on the tpy part of the ligand (Fig. 5A). Upon the third reduction however, the p-tolyl group becomes involved (Fig. 5B).

Photophysics
All the complexes exhibit emission properties after excitation at their maximum absorption band. The photophysical data of [Cr(ttpy)2]3+, ML and [Ru2Cr]7+ recorded in CH3CN are collected in Table 2. Photophysical properties of Cr(III) complexes in octahedral geometry have already been reported.19,54 Excitation of [Cr(ttpy)2]3+ in the ILCT band at 370 nm leads to the rapid population of a MC state 4T2g that decays efficiently via intersystem crossing to two doublet 2Eg and 2T1g in thermal equilibrium.55 The emission band at 785 nm is assigned to the (2Eg → 4A2g) relaxation whereas the less intense shoulder at 730 nm could be the signature of the (2T1g → 4A2g) transition (Fig. 6). The emission band of [Cr(ttpy)2]3+ is sharp and weak, typical of a MC transition. Its emission lifetime in CH3CN is estimated to be 270 ns. It is significantly shorter than that of [Cr(bpy)3]3+ (60 μs).15 The reduced lifetime and quantum yield for the tpy based complex compared to the bpy one can be partly a consequence of a more exposed Cr(III) core, which allows solvent molecules to quench the excited state more efficiently,15 and because the weak field imposed by the tridentate ligand induces a smaller energy gap which favors thermal repopulation of the 4T2g and reduces the luminescence lifetime of the 2Eg state.56

In order to gain further insight into the spectroscopic signatures of the excited states of [Cr(ttpy)2]3+, we have recorded its transient absorption profile in CH3CN after excitation using a nanosecond pulsed laser at λ = 355 nm (Fig. S4†). Upon excitation, a negative change in optical density is observed around 370 nm reflecting the bleaching of the ground state. It is accompanied by the emergence of a wide, positive ΔOD centered at 550 nm, which is attributed to the absorption of metal centered 2Eg and 2T1g states. The signals decrease back to zero with an estimated lifetime of 295 ns. This is consistent with the aforementioned emission lifetime (270 ns). This lifetime is long enough to engage [Cr(ttpy)2]3+* in a bimolecular reaction process (see further in the text).

ML displays, after excitation at 400 nm, an emission centered at 610 nm (τ = 527 ns, Φ = 0.048) typical of the 3MLCT state of [Ru(bpy)3]2+-based complexes. Lifetime and quantum yield values are slightly lower than those of an unmodified [Ru(bpy)3]2+ core (τ = 890 ns, Φ = 0.058)57 presumably due to the presence of the ether bridge connecting the terpyridine which affords additional vibronic deactivation pathways.
After excitation at 400 nm, the emission spectrum of [Ru2Cr]7+ shows the luminescence of the [Ru(bpy)3]2+ units with an important drop of the quantum yield and lifetime indicative of a significant quenching pathway Table 2. The quenching process can reasonably be attributed to an electron transfer mechanism following eqn (1), as it was reported for the mixture of [Cr(bpy)3]2+ and [Ru(bpy)3]2+.58 This reaction offers a negative free enthalpy ΔG = −0.56 eV (assuming E°(RuIII/II*) = −1.03 V by the Rehm–Weller relation) (Scheme S3†). Energy transfer from the 3MLCT of [Ru(bpy)3]2+ core (2.1 eV) to the 2MC of the Cr(III) complex (1.7 eV) shown in eqn (2) can also be a plausible quenching pathway following the Wigner selection rules.59 However the energy transfer pathway is probably less efficient than the electron transfer one, taking into account the weak overlap between [Cr(ttpy)2]3+ absorption and [Ru(bpy)3]2+* emission spectra. (1) (2)
Kinetics of the quenching process has been studied in deoxygenated CH3CN. The bimolecular quenching was first investigated by means of time-resolved emission spectroscopy for a mixture of the mononuclear [Ru(bpy)3]2+ and [Cr(ttpy)2]3+. We chose an excitation wavelength of 532 nm to selectively excite [Ru(bpy)3]2+. After this excitation, the dependence of [Ru(bpy)3]2+* lifetime on the concentration of [Cr(ttpy)2]3+ was recorded by varying the Cr(III) concentration from 1 to 10 equivalents with respect to Ru(II). Following a Stern–Volmer equation, a quenching rate constant of 3.0 × 109 M−1 s−1 was obtained for the bimolecular interaction between [Ru(bpy)3]2+* and [Cr(ttpy)2]3+ indicating that the quenching process is mainly diffusion controlled. To prove that this quenching process is due to the photoinduced electron transfer reaction, flash photolysis experiments have been performed with the mix of [Ru(bpy)3]2+ and [Cr(ttpy)2]3+ (Fig. 7). A transient spectrum recorded right after the 532 nm excitation shows the presence of a large absorption band between 700 and 850 nm, with a maximum around 800 nm typical of the [Cr(ttpy)2]2+ species that decays back to zero in the microsecond time range. The spectra do not evidence the formation of the concomitant [Cr(ttpy)2]3+* species (see spectra in Fig. S4†), showing that the energy transfer process is less efficient. Therefore the decrease of the band centered at 800 nm is attributed to a back electron transfer (BET) process between [Cr(ttpy)2]2+ and [Ru(bpy)3]3+ to regenerate the initial complexes. The kinetics of this process (kBET) was determined by fitting the decay recorded at 800 nm with a second order kinetics model (Fig. 8). kBET is thus estimated to be 1.3 × 109 M−1 s−1. It shows that the BET process is around two times slower than the quenching process of [Ru(bpy)3]2+* by [Cr(ttpy)2]3+. BET can then be short-circuited in the presence of a large concentration of a sacrificial electron donor (see the next section).

Inset: Second order kinetics analysis of the decay. The slope gives k/ε = 0.65 cm μs−1. Assuming ε to be 2000 M−1 cm−1, the kinetics rate constant for the back electron transfer process is estimated to be 1.3 × 109 M−1 s−1. 
[Ru(bpy)3]2+* is quenched by [Cr(ttpy)2]3+ leading to [Ru(bpy)3]3+ and [Cr(ttpy)2]2+. On the other hand, previous experiments have reported that the excited state of [Cr(bpy)3]3+* can be quenched by [Ru(bpy)3]2+ leading to [Cr(bpy)3]2+ and [Ru(bpy)3]3+.58,60 The feasibility of the reaction between [Cr(ttpy)2]3+* (E°[Cr(ttpy)2]3+*/[Cr(ttpy)2]2+ ≈ 1.14 V vs. Ag/AgNO310−2 M)61 (Scheme S3†) and [Ru(bpy)3]2+ (E°[Ru(bpy)3]3+/[Ru(bpy)3]2+ = 0.97 V) is difficult to experiment with our setup since [Cr(ttpy)2]3+ cannot be selectively excited in the presence of [Ru(bpy)3]2+. To prove the possible electron transfer process from [Cr(ttpy)2]3+*, we used triphenylphosphine (PPh3) as an alternative to [Ru(bpy)3]2+. PPh3 does not absorb above 330 nm and exhibits an oxidation potential (0.91 V) close to that of [Ru(bpy)3]2+.62 It is then a good substitute to [Ru(bpy)3]2+ to study the photoinduced electron transfer process from [Cr(ttpy)2]3+*. Moreover the radical [PPh3]+˙ is unstable and reacts quickly with a trace of water to form [O = PPh3] thus short-circuiting the back electron transfer.63 Continuous visible light irradiation of [Cr(ttpy)2]3+ and PPh3 leads to the formation of [Cr(ttpy)2]2+; the reaction was evidenced by the temporal evolution of the UV-visible absorption spectra of the mixture in CH3CN (Fig. S5†), where the typical absorption band of [Cr(ttpy)2]3+ is gradually replaced by those of [Cr(ttpy)2]2+. This experiment suggests then that [Cr(ttpy)2]3+* is an oxidizing agent able to transform [Ru(bpy)3]2+ into [Ru(bpy)3]3+. Irradiation of [Cr(ttpy)2]3+ and [Ru(bpy)3]2+ would therefore lead to [Ru(bpy)3]3+ and [Cr(ttpy)3]2+ independently of the nature of the excited complex.
The luminescence decay of [Ru2Cr]7+ recorded at 600 nm after excitation at 400 nm is best fitted with a bi-exponential function (Table 2) reflecting both quenched and unquenched Ru(II) centers. This bi-exponential decay has already been reported in similar trimetallic complexes based on alternating Ru(II) and Co(III)64 or Ru(II) and Fe(II) units.65 The short decay (τ1 < 10 ns) represents ≈60% of the total intensity decay and is attributed to an intramolecular electron transfer process as discussed earlier. The longer decay (τ2 ≈ 600 ns) is close to that of ML and represents ≈ 40% of the total decay. One plausible hypothesis to explain the presence of two lifetimes is the dissociation of the trinuclear complex upon irradiation releasing a free ML in solution.66 It could be also due to the fact that the electronic excitation involving the external bipyridines (not bound to the [Cr(ttpy)2]3+ unit) cannot reach the central chromium because of steric constraints.67 The intramolecular quenching constant kq (s−1) for [Ru2Cr]7+ has been determined from the luminescence lifetimes following eqn (3), (3)where τ1 and τ2 are respectively the short and long component of the bi-exponential luminescence decay. The kq value is estimated to be 2 × 108 s−1. The intramolecular quenching process between [Ru(bpy)3]2+* and [Cr(ttpy)3]3+ subunits is faster than what we already obtained between [Ru(bpy)3]2+* and [Co(ttpy)2]3+ built with the same metallo-ligand (kq = 8.5 × 106 s−1).31 This is in accordance with the more negative reduction potential of [Cr(ttpy)2]3+ (E1/2 = −0.47 V) compared to [Co(ttpy)2]3+ (E1/2 = −0.06 V).
Photoinduced reduction in the presence of TEOA
[Cr(ttpy)2]3+* can be reduced to [Cr(ttpy)2]2+ in the presence of PPh3, as previously described in the text. In contrast, we found that when triethanolamine (TEOA) was used in place of PPh3 as the sacrificial electron donor, [Cr(ttpy)2]3+* was doubly reduced to [Cr(ttpy)2]+ due to the stronger reducing power of TEOA (Epa = 0.46 V) than that of PPh3 (Epa = 0.91 V). The photoinduced electron transfer has been followed by UV-visible absorption spectroscopy under continuous irradiation between 400 and 700 nm (Fig. 9). In a first step [Cr(ttpy)2]3+* is reduced to [Cr(ttpy)2]2+ by reaction with TEOA. The initial absorption band of [Cr(ttpy)2]3+ at 366 nm is quickly replaced by those of [Cr(ttpy)2]2+ at 486, 570 and 805 nm (Fig. 9A). The reaction is quantitative after 5 min of irradiation (determined by comparison of the absorbance value obtained at 805 nm after irradiation). In a second step, under prolonged irradiation [Cr(ttpy)2]2+ is further reduced to [Cr(ttpy)2]+ in the presence of TEOA as evidenced by the typical absorption growth at 520, 560 and 723 nm. This second reduction process is around 35 times slower with a conversion rate of 80% after 3.3 h of irradiation (Fig. 9B). In the dark, no reaction occurs.
 Fig. 9  UV visible absorption evolution vs. time of a solution of [Cr(ttpy)2]3+ (3 × 10−5 M) with TEOA (15 mM) under visible light irradiation: formation of [Cr(ttpy)2]2+ from 0 s (a) to 200 s (b) (A); formation of [Cr(ttpy)2]+ from 200 s (b) to 104 s (c) (B). 
A Stern–Volmer experiment has been conducted based on the reduction of the transient absorption decay of [Cr(ttpy)2]3+* at 520 nm (after excitation at 355 nm) vs. increasing concentration of the sacrificial electron donor. The quenching rate constant between [Cr(ttpy)2]3+* and TEOA is estimated to be 3 × 109 M−1 s−1, which is an order of magnitude faster than that between [Cr(ttpy)2]3+* and PPh3 (kq = 3 × 108 M−1 s−1). It is in accordance with the fact that TEOA is a stronger reducing agent. The second reduction step leading to [Cr(ttpy)2]+ may involve the photogenerated species [Cr(ttpy)2]2+* and its reduction with TEOA. Since [Cr(ttpy)2]2+* can be reduced by TEOA but not by PPh3, its reduction potential is estimated between 0.45 and 0.90 V. It may also be the consequence of the formation of the amino alkyl radical TEOA˙ (obtained after the oxidation of TEOA) which is a strong electron donor species68 and can directly reduce [Cr(ttpy)2]2+ from its ground state. The complete mechanism of this second reduction step is still under investigation.
Addition of [Ru(bpy)3]2+ to [Cr(ttpy)2]3+ and TEOA in CH3CN increases the rates of both reduction steps of [Cr(ttpy)2]3+ (Fig. 10). Indeed [Ru(bpy)3]2+ absorbs more strongly the 400–500 nm light than [Cr(ttpy)2]3+. Its excited state is efficiently quenched by [Cr(ttpy)2]3+ to produce the [Ru(bpy)3]3+ and [Cr(ttpy)2]2+ transient species. TEOA in solution regenerates the [Ru(bpy)3]2+ starting complex. Moreover [Ru(bpy)3]2+* can also be quenched by [Cr(ttpy)2]2+ to form [Cr(ttpy)2]+ (ΔG° is estimated to −0.26 eV by comparison of the redox potentials of both partners, see Scheme S3†). Evolution of the absorption spectra of the mixture of the three compounds shows the accumulation of the [Cr(ttpy)2]+ complex in solution. The bi-electronic photoreduction of [Cr(ttpy)2]3+ occurs 10 times faster in the presence of [Ru(bpy)3]2+. The conversion rate is estimated to be around 60% after 20 min of irradiation. However, prolonged irradiation leads to a degradation of the [Ru(bpy)3]2+ photosensitizer evidenced by a decrease of the absorbance around 450 nm (Fig. S6†).
 Fig. 10  UV visible absorption evolution of a solution of [Cr(ttpy)2]3+ (3 × 10−5 M) and [Ru(bpy)3]2+ (7 × 10−5 M) with TEOA (15 mM) under visible light irradiation. Inset: Evolution of absorbance at 570 nm versus irradiation time. 
As expected irradiation of [Ru2Cr]7+ in the presence of TEOA leads firstly to the formation of [Ru2Cr]5+ with the storage of two electrons on the [Cr(ttpy)2]+ subunit (Fig. 11). The reaction takes longer compared to the irradiation of the mixture of both [Ru(bpy)3]2+ and [Cr(ttpy)2]3+ complexes in a 2:1 ratio with TEOA. The evolution of the absorption spectra does not show any degradation of the [Ru(bpy)3]2+ subunits, and the conversion rate is increased as evidenced by the large absorbance around 560 nm, suggesting that the mechanism of photoreduction is probably different within a trinucler linked system. Moreover, the absorption spectrum obtained after 2 h of irradiation shows the quantitative conversion of [Ru2Cr]7+ to [Ru2Cr]4+. The [Cr(ttpy)2]3+ initial subunit is not only reduced to [Cr(ttpy)2]+ but also to the [Cr(ttpy)2]0 state. To justify the formation of [Cr(ttpy)2]0 we postulate that the excited state of the [Ru(bpy)3]2+ subunits in [Ru2Cr]7+ is also reduced by TEOA, added in large excess into solution. The photogenerated [Ru(bpy)3]+ transient species with a Epc = −1.54 V can reduce the [Cr(ttpy)2]+ species to [Cr(ttpy)2]0 (Scheme S3†). The rate constant of electron transfer between [Ru(bpy)3]2+* and TEOA is low (kq ≈ 105 M−1 s−1)69 and thus the kinetics of the photoreduction of [Ru2Cr]7+ is reduced compared to the kinetics of reduction of [Cr(ttpy)2]3+ by free [Ru(bpy)3]2+ in solution, where the electron transfer mechanism occurs through the oxidative quenching of [Ru(bpy)3]2+* by [Cr(tppy)2]3+. Within the [Ru2Cr]7+ trinuclear complex, the intramolecular electron transfer process between [Ru(bpy)3]2+* and [Cr(ttpy)2]3+ might be followed by a fast back electron transfer process that cannot be short-circuited by TEOA. The quenching of [Ru(bpy)3]2+* subunits by TEOA is possible only because the intramolecular electron transfer between [Ru(bpy)3]2+* and [Cr(ttpy)2]3+ is not total in [Ru2Cr]7+ as suggested by the bi-exponential decay of the [Ru(bpy)3]2+* luminescence lifetime in the trinuclear assembly. In such a case, the photoreduction of the [Cr(ttpy)2]3+ center is slower, but can exceed the two electron process to generate a [Cr(ttpy)2]0 core.

Conclusion
In this work we have re-examined the electrochemical and spectroscopic properties of [Cr(ttpy)2]3+ with the aim to use the complex as a redox photosensitizer or an electron acceptor in a dyad architecture. Under visible light irradiation, [Cr(ttpy)2]3+* exhibits a weak emission at 770 nm with a lifetime of 270 ns in CH3CN. Application of the Rehm–Weller equation suggests that [Cr(ttpy)2]3+* is a higher oxidizing agent than the common [Ru(bpy)3]2+* complex with the redox potential estimated to be E°([Cr(ttpy)2]3+*/[Cr(ttpy)2]2+) = 1.14 V vs. Ag/AgNO3 10−2 M. We have shown here that [Cr(ttpy)2]3+* can be reduced by PPh3 (Epa = 0.91 V) or TEOA (Epa = 0.46 V). With TEOA, [Cr(ttpy)2]3+* undergoes consecutively two mono-electronic reduction processes leading to [Cr(ttpy)2]+. Our experiments proved that [Cr(ttpy)2]3+ can accumulate multiple electrons under visible light irradiation. The reduction sequence is accompanied by a large evolution of the UV-visible spectrum of the solution and suggests also that such complex can be integrated in the design of smart windows.
In the presence of [Ru(bpy)3]2+ as an extra antenna for solar energy harvesting, the kinetics of the two-electron reduction process of [Cr(ttpy)2]3+ by TEOA is accelerated. This increase in the rate constant is attributed to a photoinduced electron transfer process from [Ru(bpy)3]2+* to [Cr(ttpy)2]3+, leading to [Cr(ttpy)2]2+ and [Ru(bpy)3]3+, followed by the regeneration of [Ru(bpy)3]2+ by reaction with TEOA. However when both photosensitive units are linked through an ether bridge in a Ru(II)–Cr(III)–Ru(II) trinuclear complex, the kinetics of the photoreduction process in the presence of TEOA is slowed down as a probable consequence of a fast back electron transfer process between the transient [Cr(ttpy)2]2+ and [Ru(bpy)3]3+ species.

ADF 2012 manual: In a scalar relativistic run ADF employs the single point group symmetry and only the so-called scalar relativistic corrections, Darwin and Mass-Velocity. The treatment is not strictly first-order, but is quasi-relativistic, in the sense that the first-order scalar relativistic Pauli Hamiltonian is diagonalized in the space of the non-relativistic solutions, i.e. in the non-relativistic basis set.
