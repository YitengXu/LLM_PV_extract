    , Accepted 20th February 2019First published on 20th February 2019AbstractA new spirobifluorene-based hole-transporting material (spiro-tBuBED) was efficiently synthesized on the gram scale via straightforward C–H activations/arylations. Perovskite solar cells with spiro-tBuBED showed a promising power conversion efficiency of 18.6% without a device oxidation process previously considered to be indispensable.
The hole-transporting material (HTM) is the most important component of the perovskite solar cell (PSC), as it is required to enhance the power conversion efficiency (PCE) and stability of PSC devices.1–9 With targeted development based on the extensively used small-molecule hole transporters, efficient perovskite solar cells based on, for instance, H101,10 B[BMPDP]2,11 KR133,12 azulenes,13 or FDT 14 have achieved PCEs of up to 20%. However, we have noticed that preparation of these HTMs must employ traditional synthetic techniques, which have required tedious substrate pre-functionalizations such as lithiation, borylation, or stannylation prior to Suzuki or Stille reactions. On the other hand, and more importantly, in device fabrications, solar cells based on these small-molecule HTMs have been observed to usually remain ineffective until a device oxidation process of 1–4 hours was performed. These disadvantages with respect to synthesis and device preparation might reduce the commercialization opportunities of these potentially useful HTMs. Therefore, in the current work, we set out to overcome the above hurdles, and achieved several major improvements: (1) a step-economical synthesis of a new spiro-linked molecule via straightforward C–H bond activations/arylations, (2) aging-/oxidation-free device fabrications, and (3) gram-scale synthesis of our target molecule.
As shown in Fig. 1, we designed a new spirobifluorene-core-based oligoaryl compound incorporating 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) as a π-spacer and t-butyl (tBu) groups as end substituents. This molecule was named spiro-bis(triphenylamine)ethylenedi-oxythiophenediphenyl, which was further abbreviated to spiro-tBuBED. Spiro-tBuBED was facilely synthesized in two steps free of starting material metalations through direct C–H bond activation/arylation reactions.15 In addition, unlike devices employing other spirobifluorene-based small molecules, we found that perovskite solar cells using spiro-tBuBED as the HTM did not need any device oxidation treatment, and displayed a high PCE of 18.6% immediately after being fabricated.
 Fig. 1  
Spiro-tBuBED: a new t-butyl-substituted spirobifluorene-core-based oligoaryl compound as an efficient hole-transporting material. 
The two synthetic routes to our target HTM are detailed in Scheme 1. Had spiro-tBuBED been prepared using the traditional synthetic approaches, Suzuki- or Stille cross couplings would have necessarily been involved as key reactions requiring substrate prefunctionalization steps such as bromination, Li/Br-exchange, and borylation (compounds 3, 4). Moreover, use of the Stille reaction would have required the synthesis of toxic organotin reagents 6 or treatment of related tin chemical wastes. Following this method would have taken at least eight chemical transformations/operations. In contrast, we report herein a step-saving access to spiro-tBuBED using a two-step C–H/C–Br cross-coupling strategy. Direct C–H monoarylation of EDOT 1 with bromotriphenylamine derivative 2 afforded the key building block 5 in 71% yield. Through a second C–H bond activation/arylation, 5 further reacted with 2,2′,7,7′-tetrabromo-9,9′-spirobifluorene 7 to give the target molecule in moderate yield (65%). This synthesis shortcut was developed to provide a rapid and user-friendly alternative route to spiro-bifluorene-based hole-transporting materials.
 Scheme 1  Two synthetic routes to spiro-tBuBED. Reaction conditions for the direct C–H/C–Br couplings: (i) 1st C–H/C–Br: 1 (3.00 mmol), 2 (1.00 mmol), Pd(OAc)2 (0.05 mmol), P(Cy)3 (0.10 mmol), PivOH (0.30 mmol), K2CO3 (1.50 mmol), DMF (3 mL), 100 °C, 6 h; (ii) 2nd C–H/C–Br: 5 (2.10 mmol), 7 (0.50 mmol), Pd(OAc)2 (0.05 mmol), P(o-tolyl)3 (0.10 mmol), PivOH (0.30 mmol), K2CO3 (2.25 mmol), DMF (4.5 mL), 100 °C, 48 h. 
After carrying out this synthesis, we calculated the optical bandgap (ΔEg) of spiro-tBuBED by evaluating its UV/Vis absorption and photoluminescence properties (ΔEg = 1240/λintersect = 2.58 eV). The electrochemistry of spiro-tBuBED was investigated by conducting cyclic voltammetry, which yielded a highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy of −5.30 eV, a value between that of the perovskite layer (EHOMO = −5.43 eV) and that of the Au electrode (EHOMO = −5.10 eV). In addition, we also obtained the thermal properties of spiro-tBuBED by performing thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Compared with the commercial hole-transporting material spiro-OMeTAD (Td = 417 °C; Tg = 126 °C), we were pleased to find that our HTM exhibited comparable thermal stability (Td = 416 °C) and a superior glass transition temperature (Tg = 258 °C). The hole mobility of spiro-tBuBED was estimated by carrying out a space-charge-limited current (SCLC) investigation. This analysis yielded a hole-transport ability (μh = 2.29 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) similar to that of spiro-OMeTAD (μh = 3.53 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1). The corresponding spectra are provided in ESI.†
Furthermore, perovskite solar cells using spiro-tBuBED as the HTM were fabricated, and their performance measures are shown in Table 1. Spiro-tBuBED-based solar cells displayed a remarkable open-circuit voltage (Voc = 1.102 V), higher than that of cells based of spiro-OMeTAD (Voc = 1.022 V). We also measured notable short-circuit current (Jsc = 22.99 mA cm−2) and fill factor (FF = 0.735) values, corresponding to a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.60% and superior to the cells with spiro-OMeTAD. Under forward and reverse scanning, as shown in Fig. 2a, our devices demonstrated minimal hysteresis effects, smaller than those of solar cells with spiro-OMeTAD. Acquired photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra (Fig. 2b) showed that solar cells employing spiro-tBuBED as the hole-transporting layer were able to achieve approximately 85% IPCE for absorption wavelengths of 450–700 nm, with this IPCE value comparable to those of the cells with spiro-OMeTAD. Importantly, we also performed time-resolved PL (TRPL) experiments with the spiro-tBuBED-based devices. Spiro-tBuBED/perovskite showed a better quenching behavior than did spiro-OMeTAD/perovskite. The fitted average lifetime of spiro-tBuBED/perovskite was determined to be 14.5 ns, better than the 20.6 ns value for spiro-OMeTAD/perovskite. This result indicated a superior charge extraction capability for spiro-tBuBED than for spiro-OMeTAD (the corresponding TRPL spectra are shown in Fig. S7 in ESI†).

To shed light on the uniqueness of spiro-tBuBED-based photovoltaic devices, we carried out experiments involving measuring PCEs for various device oxidation times (Fig. 3). Our previous experience with device preparation suggested oxidation treatment to be indispensable for increasing the conductivity of hole-transport materials. But surprisingly, compared to the perovskite solar cells using commercial spiro-OMeTAD as the HTM, the cells with spiro-tBuBED did not require any device oxidation process, having demonstrated a >18% PCE immediately after the device fabrication was complete. Moreover, the PCEs based on forward and reverse scans remained stable for at least 4 hours. The cells with spiro-OMeTAD, in contrast, needed at least 1 hour of oxidation under an atmospheric environment to achieve their best power conversion efficiencies with the highest value of hole-mobility of the HTM. In addition, the PCE based on the forward scan started to decline after 1 hour under oxidation. We believe that the fabrication of perovskite solar cells without the need to perform pre-oxidations would be beneficial to the subsequent roll-to-roll device encapsulation processing and commercialization.

Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 4, we produced current density–time (i–t) and efficiency–time (η–t) plots of the PSC with spiro-tBuBED and of that with spiro-OMeTAD, under continuous one sun illumination. They both showed quick response, and stable output values for over 600 s. In addition, the efficiency levels of both PSCs decreased by 4–5% after the devices were stored in a box under 30% RH at 25–28 °C for 4 weeks (Fig. S8†). We speculated that the decreased efficiency might have been due to the leakage of additives. We also acquired top-view SEM images of the HTMs and a cross-section SEM image of the devices, as shown in ESI (Fig. S9 and S10†). Compared to spiro-OMeTAD, the spiro-tBuBED-based film was observed to be smoother, which apparently led to its higher Voc and better device stability.

Encouraged by the results shown in Table 1, Fig. 3 and 4, we further scaled up the essential C–H arylation reaction of the end-group molecule 5 with core molecule 7 (Scheme 2). The C–H/C–Br coupling reaction proceeded smoothly to yield 1.41 grams (61% yield) of the desired spiro-tBuBED HTM after column chromatography purification. Procedures for the gram-scale synthesis are detailed in ESI.†

Finally, we compared our spiro-tBuBED with other high-performance small-molecule HTMs in terms of synthesis, estimated cost/price, and PCEs (Table 2). The non-spiro-type molecules such as BTT-3 (ref. 17) and ATT-OMe18 were prepared using 7 synthetic steps on a relatively small scale (0.38–0.39 grams at key-steps), thus leading to higher estimated costs (568–598 USD per mmol HTM). Nevertheless, the solar cells with BTT-3 or ATT-OMe demonstrated very promising PCEs over 18%. On the other hand, the commercial spiro-OMeTAD18 and our spiro-tBuBED were accessed by using only 3 chemical transformations and on larger synthetic scales (1.07–1.41 grams). The cost of spiro-tBuBED was estimated to be much lower than the costs of other HTMs.

In summary, we have demonstrated a new spiro-bifluorene-based symmetrical molecule (spiro-tBuBED) incorporating EDOT as π-bridges and di-t-butyl-triphenylamine as end groups. Spiro-tBuBED can be successfully synthesized through sequential C–H arylations on the gram scale, and we expect this synthesis to become a viable and sustainable alternative approach for use both in academia and industry. Perovskite-based solar cells using spiro-tBuBED as the hole-transporting layer displayed – without the need for any device oxidation treatment – a power conversion efficiency of 18.6%, exceeding the PCEs acquired from the cells with the most-used spiro-OMeTAD. The design and step-economical synthesis of new organic molecules for application as efficient HTMs are currently underway in our laboratory.
