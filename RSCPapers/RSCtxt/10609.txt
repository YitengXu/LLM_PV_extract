    , Accepted 12th November 2013First published on 12th November 2013AbstractA convenient and operable fabrication technique has been demonstrated for self-assembled vertically aligned anatase TiO2 nanowires on FTO glass with tunable length in the range of 15–55 μm for multi-layered configuration photoanode based DSSCs application. DSSCs based on 47 μm-long multi-layered anatase TiO2 nanowire arrays attain a power conversion efficiency of 9.40%, which is the highest value for nanowire array based DSSCs to date.

Broader context
Photoanode materials have been found to play important roles in the power conversion efficiency of dye-sensitized solar cells. One-dimensional (1D) nanostructures such as nanorods, nanowires or nanotubes have become the focuses and have shown respectable photovoltaic performance because of their excellent electron transport and light scattering ability. However, their low surface area limits further enhancement of power conversion efficiency. One of the various solutions is to further extend the length of such 1D nanostructures. Our work here proposes a facile and operable methods to fabricate ultra-long vertically aligned multi-layered anatase TiO2 nanowires on FTO glass substrates with sufficient surface area as conventional nanoparticle based photoanodes. When employed as an efficient electron transport and charge collection medium in DSSCs, they depict the highest conversion efficiency (9.40%) so far achieved with N719-sensitized TiO2 nanowire array based photoelectrodes. Moreover, such materials synthesized in this report showcased their promising potential applications in various fields like sensors, photocatalysis, batteries, fuel cells and photoelectrochemical water splitting due to their unique opto-electronic properties including large surface area, superior electron transfer as well as prominent light-harvesting efficiency.

Among third-generation photovoltaic devices, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have been recognized as the most promising candidate for low-cost and high-efficiency solar-to-electricity energy conversion.1–4 Typically, mesoporous TiO2 nanoparticle (NP) films were widely used as photoanodes in DSSCs to provide large internal surface area for anchoring sufficient dye-loading.5,6 However, further improvement in DSSCs performance has been restricted by the random electrical pathway and short electron diffusion length (10–35 μm) induced by excessive trapping and detrapping events occurring within enormous defects, surface states and grain boundaries of NPs.7–11 On the other hand, one-dimensional (1D) vertically aligned TiO2 nanostructures such as nanorods (NRs), nanowires (NWs) or nanotubes (NTs) have been estimated to significantly increase the electron diffusion length up to 100 μm for DSSCs since they confer the advantages of providing direct electron transfer pathways and effectively suppressing photo-generated charge recombination.12–17
Particularly, high specific surface area, fast electron transport, and pronounced light-scattering effects are indispensable, yet generally mutually incompatible with one another, to achieve a high performance photoanode.18–21 For instance, the aforementioned 1D nanostructures normally possess a low internal surface area, resulting in poor dye adsorption and thereby low light-harvesting efficiency.22–25 One remedy for this problem is to extend length of 1D nanomaterials or synthesize branched nanorods to increase the internal surface area for high dye-adsorption.15,26 Recently, long rutile TiO2 NRs (∼30 μm) on a FTO glass substrate were synthesized via the hydrothermal route and subsequent etching treatment in the presence of corrosive concentrated hydrochloric acid.27 However, rutile TiO2 was found inferior to anatase TiO2 in photovoltaic performance.28 Hence, some progress in fabricating anatase 1D TiO2 NWs or NTs on a Ti-foil substrate have been made by the hydrothermal method or anodization.26,29,30 However, the efficiencies were still far from satisfactory due to the back-side illuminated DSSC configuration. To tackle this issue, direct growth of 1D anatase TiO2 nanoarrays on FTO glass substrates would be a promising route for a front-side illumination pattern. Vertically aligned anatase TiO2 NWs or hierarchical forest-like NWs have been fabricated directly on FTO glass via a pulsed DC magnetron sputtering method, but the efficiency was still less than 5% due to the difficulty in prolonging the length of the NWs (<7 μm) with such complicated and rigorous operation conditions.31,32 Highly ordered anatase TiO2 NTs were fabricated by anodization of thick Ti film pre-sputtered on FTO glass, but it is difficult to scale up both technically and economically.33 Other routes to fabricate TiO2 NTs or NWs on FTO glass, such as ZnO template methods or film lift-off transfer procedure, were based on complicated and time-consuming processes.34,35 By contrast, we recently introduced a green and facile one-pot hydrothermal method to fabricate hierarchical anatase TiO2 nanowire arrays (18 μm in length) on FTO glass which broke the normal restriction of large lattice mismatch of ∼19% between FTO and anatase TiO2.15
Herein, we present a facile and operable hydrothermal strategy for constructing ultra-long anatase TiO2 nanowires with multi-layered configuration on FTO glass with film thickness up to ∼47 μm. Interestingly, such a multi-layered TiO2 nanowire arrays (MTNWs) photoanode embodies three different TiO2 nanostructured layers: a bottom layer made of densely packed TiO2 NWs (DTNW), an intermediate layer made of hierarchical TiO2 NWs (HTNW) with short NRs branches, and an upper layer made of loose TiO2 NWs (LTNW). Notably, a milestone efficiency of 9.40% has been successfully achieved for the DSSCs based on MTNWs photoanodes, which overrides the literature values so far reported for oriented TiO2 NWs-based DSSCs.
The oriented MTNWs on FTO glass were prepared via multiple hydrothermal reaction cycles without any surfactant and template. The synthesis routes were based on the reaction of K2TiO(C2O4)2 in a mixed solution of deionized water and diethylene glycol (DEG), which resulted in the intelligent multilayer assemblies of TiO2 nanowires arrays on FTO glass substrate.
The morphology of the MTNWs was examined by SEM (Fig. 1). Fig. 1a–d shows the detailed SEM images of MTNWs synthesized after three equivalent hydrothermal cycles at 180 °C. The cross-sectional SEM images (Fig. 1a) reveal that the MTNWs are well-aligned against the FTO glass substrate with a thickness of ∼47 μm. Interestingly, a three-layer assembly of TiO2 NWs arrays was obtained, in which each layer was 15–16 μm thick and a strong mechanical connection between each NW layer can be observed. In addition, magnified views (Fig. 1b–d) corresponding to the white rectangular frame marked on image (a) show the distinct morphology of each layer of TiO2 NWs arrays. In particular, firstly, the bottom layer (Fig. 1d) consists of densely aligned and packed TiO2 NWs with a diameter ranging from 80–150 nm. Secondly, the intermediate layer (Fig. 1c) is made up of hierarchical TiO2 NWs, namely, numerous short TiO2 NRs branches (30 nm in diameter and 50–250 nm in length) covered on the long TiO2 NWs trunk. Lastly, sparse and smooth NWs with a diameter ranging from 60–120 nm are obviously observed on the top layer (Fig. 1b). It is worth noting that continuously increasing the hydrothermal reaction cycle would lead to the top-ended collapse of the NWs. The XRD patterns confirmed that the obtained MTNWs nanostructures were well-crystallized as anatase phase (Fig. S1†).
 Fig. 1  (a) The cross-sectional SEM images of MTNWs on FTO glass prepared after three hydrothermal cycles (9 + 9 + 9 h); (b, c, and d) the FE-SEM images of the upper, intermediate and bottom layer of as-prepared MTNWs, respectively. 
According to our previous report, simply prolonging the hydrothermal duration in a one-pot reaction has no significant effect on the film thickness.15 Herein, thick anatase TiO2 NWs films could be obtained by refreshing the hydrothermal solution for more than one hydrothermal cycle. Thus, hydrothermal cycle-dependent experiments were performed to investigate the growth process of MTNWs as well as the relationship between the hydrothermal cycles and the thickness of anatase TiO2 NWs. Each hydrothermal reaction cycle was constant (180 °C, 9 h) and up to 4 cycles were carried out. As shown in Fig. S2a, d and g,† ∼15 μm, 32 μm and 55 μm-long anatase TiO2 NW arrays were obtained by refreshing the hydrothermal reaction solution with 1 cycle (9 h), 2 cycles (9 + 9 h) and 4 cycles (9 + 9 + 9 + 9 h), respectively. In cycle 1 (9 h, Fig. S2a†), a uniformly distributed structure can be observed at the top of the TiO2 NWs film (Fig. S2b†). However, the bottom of the NWs was compactly aligned against the FTO substrate (Fig. S2c†). After cycle 2 (9 + 9 h), a double-layered TiO2 NWs array was obtained, in which the top-layer was the mixture of hierarchical TiO2 NWs (with short NR branches) and a minor portion of smooth NWs (Fig. S2e†), while the bottom layer of TiO2 NWs had become dense and some wires grown in this stage had a larger diameter and fused with others, leading to a bundled structure (Fig. S2f†). For cycle 3 (9 + 9 + 9 h), the length of the NWs was continuously enlarged while in the meantime the interesting multi-layered TiO2 NW array was attained (Fig. 1a–d). Even though the hydrothermal conditions for each hydrothermal cycle was constant, an engineered assembly multi-layered TiO2 NWs-based photoanode could be reasonably achieved. The reasons why the TiO2 NWs exhibited distinct morphologies for three-layer stacking could be explained by the following facts: (1) some portion of the precursor reactant had been contributed to the more densely aligned TiO2 NWs bottom layer due to the preferentially induced growth brought by the pre-coated TiO2 seed layer, and such compact packing did not provide sufficient space for branched modification; (2) the increasingly exhausted reactant concentration enable the growth of loose NWs, and thus the NWs in the intermediate layer made subsequent branch growth possible; (3) the sparse and smooth NWs top-layer was obtained due to the substantial consumption of reactant on continuous growth of the bottom and intermediate layer, and thus only a smaller portion of reactant contributed to the extra growth of the third-layer TiO2 NWs and eventually formed loosely aligned TiO2 NWs without branches germination. Further adding one more cycle to 4 (9 + 9 + 9 + 9 h), although the film thickness was still enlarged (Fig. S2g,† ∼55 μm), the space between the adjacent TiO2 NWs across the film had shrunk significantly due to the fusion of the wires and additional germination of unexpected nanoparticles around the surface of wires (Fig. S2h†). Especially worthy of note was the severe fusion and aggregation of the roots of the wires, leading to quite densely packed NWs with a small inter-wire separation, which was detrimental to electrolyte penetration and electron transfer (Fig. S2i†). Notably, unlike other detachment phenomena observed on the thicker TiO2 nanorod arrays prepared with the hydrothermal method,36 the current mild synthesis technique conferred excellent adhesion between the TiO2 NWs and FTO substrate even when they reached lengths of tens of micrometers. Scheme 1 presents the synthesis strategy of long TiO2 NWs with multi-layered configuration on a FTO substrate. In this process, three alternate cycles of hydrothermal reaction were required to prepare the optimized MTNWs with sufficient thickness for dye adsorption.

The anatase TiO2 NWs prepared at different cycles of hydrothermal reaction were applied as photoanodes to fabricate DSSCs. Fig. 2 shows the typical photocurrent density–photovoltage (J–V) curves (Fig. 2a) and the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra (Fig. 2b) of DSSCs based on different TiO2 photoanodes with the following identifier and configuration: DSSCs-9 h (one cycle, single layer, ∼15 μm in length); DSSCs-9 + 9 h (two cycles, double layer, ∼32 μm in length); DSSCs-9 + 9 + 9 h (three cycles, three layer, ∼47 μm in length) and DSSCs-9 + 9 + 9 + 9 h (four cycles, three layer, ∼55 μm in length). The detailed photovoltaic performance parameters are summarized in Table 1. In order to make the results significant and reliable, the statistical efficiency with standard deviation of five independent measurements for DSSCs based on different photoanodes were therefore showcased in Table 1 as well.

The efficiencies of the DSSCs based on TiO2 NWs prepared with increased cycles of hydrothermal reaction are 6.02, 8.06, 8.82 and 7.91%, respectively. The significant improvement in efficiency could be ascribed to the markedly enhanced short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc). As expected, the Jsc largely depended upon the surface area of the NW arrays. It is worth noting that the repeated hydrothermal cycles led to multilayer assembly of TiO2 NWs which could not only extend the total length of wires, but also enlarge the internal surface area of entire NWs for sufficient dye-loading. As shown in Table 1, increasing amounts of dye uptakes were achieved for TiO2 NWs with increasing length. For instance, the three-layer assembly of TiO2 NWs prepared with 4 cycles of hydrothermal reaction had the best dye-loading capacity (220.3 nmol cm−2), ∼3 times larger than that of the single layer one (69.03 nmol cm−2). The increased dye-loading amounts definitely contributed to the enhanced Jsc and thus the higher DSSC efficiencies. Specifically, it could be seen that the Jsc values increased initially (from 11.25 to 17.47 mA cm−2) with prolonged NWs length (from 15 to 47 μm) but reduced to 16.27 mA cm−2 on further extension of the hydrothermal cycles (55 μm thick NWs). This is due to the fact that continuously increased surface area may provide more sites for an unexpectedly larger recombination rate within the DSSCs which led to lower photovoltage (seen in the following EIS discussion) and Jsc. The J–V curve results also show a gradual decline in Voc (from 876 mV to 766 mV) but a slight increase in FF as the thickness of the NWs increased. The slightly increased FF could be attributed to the improved connection between the roots of bottom layer wires and the FTO substrate along with increased hydrothermal cycles, which was empirically supported by SEM images, showing the increasingly dense evolution of bottom layer wires.
For comparison, a commercial P25 nanoparticles based photoanode (∼20 μm in thickness) with similar dye-loading amounts (∼160 nmol cm−2), counterpart to the aforementioned multi-layered TiO2 NWs (DSSC-9 + 9 + 9 h) was applied to fabricate DSSCs as well. Consequently, the Jsc and Voc for P25 based DSSCs were 14.32 mA cm−2 and 750 mV, respectively, which were significantly inferior to that of MTNWs (17.47 mA cm−2 and 782 mV), leading to a considerable enhancement in efficiency for the latter (8.82%), better than its P25 nanoparticles counterpart (7.23%). The enhanced efficiency for the multi-layered TiO2 NWs arrays could be ascribed to the superior light scattering ability for enhanced light-harvesting efficiency, efficient charge collection, electrolyte penetration as well as suppressed charge recombination due to the unique 1D direct electric transfer pathway with less grain boundaries and defects.15,26,27
Moreover, IPCE spectra (Fig. 2b) indicated a similar variation tendency to the corresponding Jsc of DSSCs. As can be seen, increasing the total thickness of NWs improved the IPCE values at all wavelengths ranging from 380 to 800 nm. Compared to the cell made of P25 film, the peak value of IPCE for the MTNWs film (DSSC-9 + 9 + 9 h) increased from 74% to 86% at round 520 nm, which was near the absorption maximum of the N719 dye. Notably, an obvious red-shift of IPCE values to longer wavelengths (600–750 nm) is observed when the length of the NWs was greater than the nanoparticle film thickness due to the better light-scattering capability of the former. As seen in Fig. S3,† the results of diffused reflectance spectra of different photoanode films revealed that light-scattering ability can be effectively strengthened by thickening the film with a vertically aligned structure. It is worth pointing out the light scattering capacity for the NWs based photoanode is superior to that of the P25 film, leading to sufficient utilization of light transmitted through the films and thus enhancing the light-harvesting efficiency.
Herein, the complementary and synergistic properties of multi-layered assemblies of TiO2 NWs films could be described as follows: a bottom layer made of densely packed NWs could provide tremendous specific surface area and feature benign adhesion with the FTO substrate; an intermediate layer consisting of hierarchical NWs could guarantee good dye loading capability and adequate light-scattering capacity; a third top layer composed of loose NWs could offer superior light-scattering ability and enabled excellent interfacial charge transfer characteristics. Overall, the photovoltaic performance results illustrated that the intelligent assembly of MTNWs are definitely more favorable to fabricate high-efficiency DSSCs.
To attain better insight into the dynamics of charge transport and recombination within DSSCs, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) characterization was carried out. Fig. 3 shows the Nyquist plots of the DSSCs based on TiO2 NWs with various film thicknesses prepared with different cycles of hydrothermal reaction and P25 nanoparticles film. An equivalent circuit was simulated to fit the Nyquist plots to estimate the resistance parameters and the corresponding parameters were listed in Table S1.† Generally, two semicircles in the Nyquist plots could be observed. The small semicircles in the high frequency region and large semicircles in the low frequency region corresponded to the charge transfer at the interface of counter electrode–electrolyte and TiO2–dye–electrolyte.37 Specifically, there was a huge difference showcased in the large semicircles. As shown in Table S1,† the recombination resistance (R2) of DSSCs decreased significantly from 186.5 Ω to 43.04 Ω with the increased NWs length from 15 μm to 55 μm, and then witnessed a further decline to 23.82 Ω for P25 based DSSCs, indicating a faster recombination rate occurred within DSSCs based on the TiO2 NWs with extended length and the most severe electron recombination process in the DSSCs based on the P25 nanoparticle films which possessed numerous grain boundaries in their own random network architectures.38,39 Since the Voc value of the DSSCs was correlated with the charge recombination in the conduction band of TiO2,40,41 the electron lifetime (τr) values calculated by fitting the equation τr = R2 × CPE2 (CPE2, chemical capacitance) was used to differentiate the difference of Voc in DSSCs based on various photoanodes. Obviously, τr of the DSSCs decreased along with the increasingly extended length of the NWs, which was in concurrence with the significant reduction of Voc displayed in the J–V results. Accordingly, one can conclude that the alternate hydrothermal cycles introduced in the present work markedly augmented the specific surface area of anatase TiO2 NWs, while on the other hand simultaneously provided additional recombination sites at the surface of NWs for recombination of photo-generated electrons with I3− in the redox electrolyte. It is worth noting that the electron lifetime for all lengths of TiO2 NWs cell was longer than that of P25 based DSSCs since the former (1D nanostructure) effectively suppresses the charge recombination. P25 based DSSCs exhibited the shortest electron lifetime, suggesting that photogenerated electrons within such cells may suffer a series of trapping events or serious recombination with oxidizing species in the electrolyte as they undertook a random network pathway through the mesoporous nanoparticles film.
 Fig. 3  Electrochemical impedance spectra of DSSCs based on the TiO2 NWs prepared with different numbers of hydrothermal cycles and P25 nanoparticles photoanode in the form of Nyquist plots. The inset is the equivalent circuit applied to fit the resistance data. 
In addition, in order to examine the intrinsic electron transport and recombination properties of such nanowire structured photoanodes, we compared electrochemical impedance of DSSC-9 + 9 + 9 h under dark and illumination (100 W m−2). The corresponding Nyquist plot is shown in Fig. S4.† The fitted recombination resistance (R2) and calculated electron lifetime (τr) were also listed in Table S1.† Obviously, the values of R2 for dark and illumination are 51.81 Ω and 20.66 Ω, with corresponding τr of 0.119 s and 0.053 s, respectively. This result indicated the charge recombination becomes more serious under illumination due to the higher I3− concentration around the TiO2 electrode compared to the dark conditions, which is consistent with the previous report.42
Furthermore, thermal treatment of the photoanode is believed to play a crucial role in improving the crystallinity of as-prepared samples, which could greatly affect the photovoltaic properties of the photoelectrode. Hence, we sintered the as-prepared TiO2 nanowires photoanode (9 h) at 450 °C, 500 °C, 550 °C and 600 °C for 30 min. The XRD patterns for these four samples are shown in Fig. S5† which indicated that an improved high degree of crystallinity for pure anatase TiO2 can be obtained when the calcination temperature was up to 550 °C. However, the sample was indexed as mixed crystalline phase (anatase and rutile) when it was calcinated at 600 °C. The photovoltaic parameters of DSSCs based on the TiO2 photoanode (9 h) after thermal treatment at different temperatures are summarized in Table S2.† Interestingly, the DSSC-9 h-550 °C achieved a higher efficiency of 6.71% compared with the DSSC-9 h-500 °C (6.02%). Given that 550 °C seemed to be the most appropriate calcination temperature, we further assembled the DSSC based on TiO2 nanowires prepared after 3 hydrothermal cycles (9 + 9 + 9 h) which was calcinated at 550 °C. As seen in Fig. 4, it is worth noting that an impressive power conversion efficiency of 9.40% was achieved with Jsc of 18.25 mA cm−2, Voc of 787 mV and FF of 0.65 for the TiO2 nanowire array photoelectrode. To the best of our knowledge, the efficiency of 9.40% obtained for the multi-layered long TiO2 NWs with a length up to 47 μm is the highest record value reported to date for nanowire array based DSSCs.

To summarize, we have developed, for the first time, a convenient and operable approach to fabricate ultra-long multi-layered anatase TiO2 nanowire arrays with film thickness up to ∼47 μm on transparent conductive FTO glass substrates via a multi-step hydrothermal route without any surfactant or template. The multi-layered assemblies of TiO2 nanowires were made up of a densely packed nanowires bottom layer, a hierarchical nanowires (with branched nanorods) intermediate layer as well as a loose nanowires upper layer, which made it possible to simultaneously possess incompatible features such as high specific surface area and fast electron transport, as well as a pronounced light-scattering effect. Moreover, the DSSC based on such a multi-layered anatase TiO2 nanowire array photoelectrode were distinguished by a Jsc of 18.25 mA cm−2, a Voc of 787 mV and an impressive power conversion efficiency of 9.40%, which is superior to that of P25 nanoparticle based counterparts (7.23%) due to the prominent light scattering capacity and suppressed charge recombination of the former. It is believed that optimizing the experimental parameters to further increase the thickness of each layer and prevent the nanowires grown in the previous cycles from fusing and aggregating in the subsequent cycles would be beneficial to further enhance the overall efficiency. We anticipate that such vertically aligned long anatase TiO2 nanowire arrays with high internal surface area are of great significance for their applications in various areas such as solid-state DSSCs, quantum-dot sensitized solar cells, sensors, photocatalysis, batteries, fuel cells and photoelectrochemical water splitting.

Broader context
Photoanode materials have been found to play important roles in the power conversion efficiency of dye-sensitized solar cells. One-dimensional (1D) nanostructures such as nanorods, nanowires or nanotubes have become the focuses and have shown respectable photovoltaic performance because of their excellent electron transport and light scattering ability. However, their low surface area limits further enhancement of power conversion efficiency. One of the various solutions is to further extend the length of such 1D nanostructures. Our work here proposes a facile and operable methods to fabricate ultra-long vertically aligned multi-layered anatase TiO2 nanowires on FTO glass substrates with sufficient surface area as conventional nanoparticle based photoanodes. When employed as an efficient electron transport and charge collection medium in DSSCs, they depict the highest conversion efficiency (9.40%) so far achieved with N719-sensitized TiO2 nanowire array based photoelectrodes. Moreover, such materials synthesized in this report showcased their promising potential applications in various fields like sensors, photocatalysis, batteries, fuel cells and photoelectrochemical water splitting due to their unique opto-electronic properties including large surface area, superior electron transfer as well as prominent light-harvesting efficiency.
