    , Accepted 16th August 2014First published on 22nd August 2014AbstractIn this work, we employed wet chemically synthesized bimetallic Au–Ag core–shell nanostructures (Au–AgNSs) to enhance the photocurrent density of mesoporous TiO2 for water splitting and we compared the results with monometallic Au nanoparticles (AuNPs). While Au–AgNSs incorporated photoanodes give rise to 14× enhancement in incident photon to charge carrier efficiency, AuNPs embedded photoanodes result in 6× enhancement. By varying nanoparticle concentration in the photoanodes, we observed ∼245× less Au–AgNSs are required relative to AuNPs to generate similar photocurrent enhancement for solar fuel conversion. Power-dependent measurements of Au–AgNSs and AuNPs showed a first order dependence to incident light intensity, relative to half-order dependence for TiO2 only photoanodes. This indicated that plasmonic nanostructures enhance charge carriers formed on the surface of the TiO2 which effectively participate in photochemical reactions. Our experiments and simulations suggest the enhanced near-field, far-field, and multipolar resonances of Au–AgNSs facilitating broadband absorption of solar radiation collectively gives rise to their superior performance in water splitting.
Introduction
The conversion of solar energy into a renewable chemical fuel, which can be stored and released on demand both for stationary applications and transportation, offers a promising alternative to the use of fossil fuels. Solar driven photocatalytic water splitting affords enormous prospects to produce H2, a sustainable and clean fuel, potentially at the terawatt scale.1,2 However, despite the promise of solar-to-hydrogen conversion technology, poor efficiencies and challenges with scalability have severely hindered their broad deployment for clean energy production.3 For example, an ideal market-ready solar-to-fuel system must simultaneously (i) be composed of earth-abundant, robust, and inexpensive semiconductors which absorb broadband solar radiation,4 (ii) have long minority carrier diffusion lengths to minimize bulk recombination of e−/h+ pairs, (iii) enable separation of charge carriers and transport to the semiconductor/liquid interface where half reactions occur, and (iv) have active surface sites that enable charge transfer processes at the semiconductor/liquid interface and lower the kinetic overpotential needed for the half reactions.5,6 Currently available semiconductors do not meet all these requirements. For example the most highly investigated n-type semiconductor, TiO2, while inexpensive, has a large bandgap (3.2 eV), limiting its photoactivity to the UV region of the solar spectrum.7 Hematite, α-Fe2O3, a promising alternative to TiO2, has a narrower bandgap (2.2 eV) but suffers from low mobility of energetic charge carriers.8 Narrow bandgap semiconductors with high carrier mobility, such as Si and InP, are either limited by poor catalytic activity of surface sites (Si) or are expensive (InP) and an impractical solution to large scale devices.9
Alternatively, semiconductors integrated with metal nanostructures have demonstrated remarkably improved performance for solar-to-fuel conversion.10–16 Topologically compact metallic nanostructures with sub-wavelength dimensions couple incident photons to conduction electrons generating surface plasmon resonances (SPR) that give rise to electric fields with intensities that can be orders of magnitude greater than that of the incident field.17,18 SPR also results in strong light scattering into the far-field. These near-field and far-field properties of metal nanostructures have been long known to enhance optical properties of adjacent molecules and semiconductors by modifying their photonic mode density,19–22 a concept that has been harnessed extensively in solar devices.23–26 The SPR of metal nanostructures are governed by both geometry and dimension. Unlike spherical nanoparticles, nanostructures with sharp edges and corners such as cubic and pyramidal morphologies generate intense electromagnetic fields localized at the corners due to the quasi-static lightening rod effect.27–29 Such morphology-controlled nanostructures when integrated with semiconductors for photocatalytic water splitting give rise to enhanced light absorption and current collection.30,31
In addition to morphology, the composition of metal nanostructures also contributes to the ratio of absorbing and scattering. Bimetallic nanostructures where two metals are coupled together in core–shell architecture can be designed to exhibit enhanced electronic properties not achievable by monometallic nanostructures.32,33 Gold core-silver shell bimetallic nanostructures offer several advantages for photocatalysis including (i) multiple plasmon resonances allowing broadband absorption of solar light due to the use of dual metals, (ii) intense near-field enhancements, facilitating superior light harvesting abilities, (iii) less Ohmic losses from Ag relative to Au, giving rise to enhanced radiative damping and strong light scattering,34 and (iv) a core–shell architecture, which enables dynamic modulation of electronic properties without altering the overall size. Here we demonstrate the use of Au–Ag core–shell nanostructures (Au–AgNSs) to enhance the photoactivity of mesoporous TiO2 photoanodes. Relative to monometallic Au nanoparticles (AuNPs), Au–AgNSs demonstrate a higher absorption across the solar spectrum and stronger enhancement in incident photon to charge carrier efficiency (IPCE). Our experiments and electrodynamics simulations show that broadband absorption of incident light as well as enhanced scattering and near-field effects result in the superior performance of Au–AgNSs relative to AuNPs.
Experimental section
A. Nanostructure synthesis
AuNPs were prepared via a potassium carbonate reduction method.35 A solution containing 250 mL of Milli-Q water, 3.75 mL of 1% chloroauric acid (Sigma 254169) and 0.0625 g of potassium carbonate (Sigma P5833) was aged in the dark for two days. After aging, 1.25 mL of 37% aqueous formaldehyde (Sigma F8775) was added to the solution under rapid stirring. The solution was allowed to react for approximately 15 minutes, or until it turned orange/brown showing scattering from AuNPs. The plasmon resonance was 550 nm.
Au–Ag NSs were prepared via a seed mediated growth process as reported in our previous work.32 Au seeds were prepared by adding 0.6 mL of freshly prepared and ice cold 10 mM NaBH4 to an aqueous solution composed of 7.5 mL of 100 mM cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), 2.75 mL milli-Q water (18.2 MΩ), and 0.8 mL of 10 mM HAuCl4. This solution was stirred vigorously for 1 minute and then transferred to a 35 °C water bath, where it was left undisturbed for one hour. A growth solution was prepared by the sequential addition of 6.4 mL of 100 mM CTAB, 0.8 mL of 10 mM HAuCl4, and 3.8 mL of 100 mM ascorbic acid to 32 mL of milli-Q H2O. The seed solution was diluted by a factor of ten with milli-Q H2O. Then 20 μL of diluted seed solution was added to the growth solution, mixed gently by inversion, and then left undisturbed at 35 °C for 5 hours. The Au nanocrystal suspension was centrifuged at 1100 RCF for 12 minutes (×3) and washed and soaked in 20 mM cetyltrimethylammonium chloride (CTAC) for 15 minutes. The Au nanocrystals were then redispersed in 333 μL of H2O for use as precursor solution for Ag growth. Typically, 200 μL of precursor solution and 50 μL of 10 mM KBr were added to 5 mL of 20 mM CTAC and heated in a 65 °C water bath for 10 minutes before adding in 50 mL of 10 mM AgNO3 and 150 mL of 100 mM ascorbic acid. The solution was mixed gently by inversion and left undisturbed at 65 °C for one hour.
B. Nanostructure silica coating
Silica coating for both AuNPs and Au–Ag NSs was accomplished by a modified procedure in the literature.36 A sodium silicate solution was freshly prepared before use by adding 2 mL of 27% sodium silicate solution to a 100 mL beaker while stirring, in addition to 60 mL of 0.1 M HCl and 40 mL milli-Q water. The resulting solution of 0.54% sodium silicate was adjusted to pH 10.2 with 5 N HCl. Next, 18.3 μL of APTES (97 wt%) is added to 100 mL H2O and stirred briefly. As prepared nanoparticle solution (30 mL) was added to a 50 mL round bottom flask, in addition to 400 μL of freshly prepared APTES solution, and stirred for 15 minutes. Sodium silicate solution (1.4 mL) was then added to the nanostructure suspension, which was then placed in an oil bath at 90 °C for eight hours. After the reaction reached the desired growth thickness, it was quenched in an ice bath for 15 minutes, followed by a 15 minute centrifuge at 1500 rcf (×2).
C. Plasmonic nanostructure characterization
A Varian Cary 5000 UV-vis NIR spectrophotometer (Agilent Technologies) with dual beam capability was used to measure the extinction of the AuNPs and Au–Ag NSs in aqueous media using a 1 cm path length cuvette. The nanoparticle size, geometry, and composition were characterized using Osiris TEM at 200 keV. In order to correlate the absorbance of nanoparticle solutions with the weight percent metal, nanoparticles of a known absorbance and volume were first dried in an oven at 70 °C overnight. The mass left over from dried nanoparticles was then determined via thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and the sample composition was analyzed. More volatile substances (reducing agents and surfactants) evaporated, leaving only metal behind. Therefore, the fraction of mass remaining after drying was all due to the metal. TGA was conducted on Instrument Specialist's TGA-1000; all nanostructures were heated to 600 °C at the rate of 20 °C min−1.
D. Anode fabrication
FTO glass (MTI) was cut into 1′′ × 1/2′′ pieces and cleaned via successive 30 minute sonication cycles in IPA/acetone with 1% Triton-X and then IPA/acetone, followed by a thorough drying with nitrogen. A solution was prepared with 3 mL ethanol, 0.1 g of P25 and varied amounts of metal nanostructures; the solution was spin coated onto the substrate for 30 seconds at 600 rpm, followed by 60 seconds at 800 rpm. Following spin coating, anodes were annealed at 450 °C for 45 minutes to ensure that TiO2 was fully converted to anatase phase.
E. Electrochemical measurements and IPCE
Photocatalytic water splitting capability of anodes was tested over a potential range of −1 to 1 V at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 under AM 1.5G illumination (100 mW cm−2) with a Newport solar simulator and power supply. An average area of 0.2 cm2 was illuminated. Electrochemical measurements were conducted in a three electrode setup. A Pt foil was used as the counter electrode, Ag/AgCl was used as a reference electrode. A MetroOhm PGSTAT101 potentiostat was used for all electrochemical measurements. Chronoamperometry experiments were performed at zero bias voltage, and light chopping experiments were performed by blocking the solar simulator at intervals of 10 seconds. Incident photon to charge carrier efficiency (IPCE) measurements were conducted with a Newport system with a 300 W Xe light source, monochromator, and Si detector.
F. Electrodynamic simulations
Finite difference time domain (FDTD) simulations were performed using commercial Lumerical software. Simulations were performed on single particles in water as the surrounding medium using a total-field scattered-field (TFSF) plane wave source and a 7 angstrom mesh. The simulated Au–Ag nanocube had a 50 nm Au core and a 12.5 nm Ag shell. The simulated Au–Ag nanopyramid had a 60 nm edge length for the Au core and a 20 nm thick Ag shell. The simulated Au nanosphere had a diameter of 85 nm.
Results and discussion
Bimetallic Au–Ag NSs were synthesized following our previously reported procedure.32 Au nanocrystal cores of 46 ± 3 nm, which consisted of both rounded corner nanocubes and truncated nanocubes, were coated in Ag shell which resulted in two distinct shapes: bimetallic nanocubes with 67 ± 3 nm edge length (∼55%), and nanopyramids with 86 ± 4 nm side length and 98 ± 4 nm base length (∼45%). The rounded corner Au nanocube cores drives nucleation and growth of bimetallic nanocubes, while truncated nanocubes drive the growth of nanopyramids.32 Transmission electron micrographs of Au–AgNSs (Fig. 1a) show the high contrast Au core surrounded by lower contrast Ag shell. The Au–AgNSs are coated in a ∼5 nm layer of silica (Au–Ag@SiO2, Fig. 1b). The silica layer has multiple purposes: (i) since metals are electron scavengers, the insulating silica spacer minimizes recombination of electron–hole (e−/h+) pairs on the metal surface; (ii) silica layer minimizes Ostwald ripening during annealing of the photoanode; and (iii) silica layer also protects the nanostructures from the corrosive basic electrolyte. The plasmon enhanced water splitting ability of bimetallic nanostructures was compared with 85 nm diameter AuNPs (Fig. 1c) which were also coated with a uniform, thin layer of silica (Au@SiO2, Fig. 1d).

Plasmonic enhancement of solar devices is contributed by the absorption and scattering cross-sections of nanostructures. To understand these optical characteristics of the different shapes observed experimentally, finite difference time domain (FDTD) simulations were performed. Calculated absorption, scattering, and extinction spectra of bimetallic nanocubes (Fig. 2a) show a dipolar mode centered at 560 nm and a quadrupolar mode at 490 nm and other higher order multipole modes associated with the nanocube corners.37 Calculated spectra for bimetallic nanopyramids show dual resonances when excited with a perpendicularly polarized light due to excitation of both dipole and quadrupole modes (Fig. 2b). The dipole resonance is observed at 720 nm, the quadrupole resonance at 600 nm, and other higher order modes are observed due to excitation of the various corners of the pyramids.32 The near-field intensity plot indicates intense electromagnetic fields localized on the edges and corners at the dipole resonance of nanocubes (Fig. 2e-i) and nanopyramids (Fig. 2e-ii). Calculations of AuNPs show a dipole resonance centered around 555 nm with stronger absorption relative to scattering (Fig. 2c). Simulations demonstrate that the overall optical characteristics of Au–Ag nanocubes and nanopyramids combined together supersede those of AuNPs; the presence of the nanopyramids also gives rise to near-infrared resonances enabling broadband light absorption.

(d) Experimental extinction spectra of Au@SiO2 nanoparticles with a plasmon resonance at 560 nm and Au–Ag@SiO2 nanostructures showing dual resonances at 535 nm and 630 nm. (e) Electromagnetic intensity profile, <E2/E02>, of (i) Au–Ag nanocubes, (ii) Au–Ag nanopyramids, and (iii) Au nanoparticles. Profiles were collected at the dipole resonance of each shape. A plane wave of intensity one was injected along the x-axis with propagation occurring along the y-axis. Color bars represent intensities of the resulting electric fields. 
The experimental extinction spectra of Au–Ag@SiO2 nanostructures exhibit dual plasmon resonances (Fig. 2d) centered at 535 nm which is primarily attributed to the nanocubes and at 630 nm which is due to the nanopyramids. While the experimental dipole modes of Au–Ag nanocubes matches well with calculated spectra, for the nanopyramids the dipole and quadrupole mode are overlapped into a single peak in experiments relative to simulations. This difference in spectral characteristics between experiments and simulations is likely attributed to two factors: (i) heterogeneities in the nanopyramids shape and size resulting from the synthesis process, and (ii) calculated spectra of nanopyramids represent a perfectly symmetric Au core within the Ag shell, but experimentally we either observe an outer shell of non-uniform thickness or a nonconcentric alignment of the core and shell. This results in symmetry breaking allowing quadrupolar modes to hybridize with dipolar modes which results in single strong peak in experiments red-shifted from the calculated quadrupole mode and blue-shifted from the calculated dipole mode. The experimental plasmon resonance of Au@SiO2 nanoparticles centered at 550 nm overlaps well with calculations.
Following synthesis, Au@SiO2-NPs and Au–Ag@SiO2-NSs were embedded in photoanodes mixed with mesoporous TiO2 (P25). Detailed characterization of the mesoporous TiO2 nanoparticles is provided in the ESI (Fig. S1†). A size analysis of ∼161 nanoparticles was conducted and the average size was found to be ∼23 nm (Fig. S2†). The mesoporous TiO2 is beneficial to device performance due to the large surface area in contact with electrolyte per unit volume. Due to the large bandgap of TiO2, control photoanodes (TiO2 only) show minimal absorbance in the visible (Fig. 3a). The photoanodes with Au@SiO2-NPs exhibit an enhanced absorption in the visible region relative to the control; however, due to the overall poor extinction cross-section of spherical AuNPs and high Ohmic losses the absorption enhancement is not significant. Photoanodes with Au–Ag@SiO2-NSs increased the overall absorption through the full spectral range from 350–750 nm. This improved absorption is attributed to the multiple plasmon resonances of Au–Ag@SiO2-NSs spanning the entire visible spectrum. Additionally, due to high dielectric constant of TiO2 (ε > 8) the plasmon resonances of Au–Ag@SiO2 are expected to red-shift in the TiO2 nanoparticle film which explains the absorption enhancement beyond 650 nm. We note spherical nanoparticles are typically less sensitive in sensing the change in refractive index of surrounding medium relative to nanocubes and nanopyramids. The enhanced absorption is also attributed to the overall larger extinction cross-section of Au–AgNSs relative to AuNPs as observed in simulations (Fig. 2).

(b) IPCE curves of non-enhanced (TiO2 only) and plasmon enhanced photoanodes. The plasmon enhanced photoanodes are at the optimized concentration. (c) Enhancement in photocurrent as a function of wavelength obtained from IPCE data of plasmon enhanced photoanodes relative to TiO2 only photoanodes. The error bars were obtained from >4 devices. 
The photocatalytic water splitting ability of photoanodes were analyzed in a three-electrode set-up with Pt counter electrode and Ag/AgCl reference hydrogen electrode (RHE) under AM 1.5G illumination (100 mW cm−2). Relative to control, IPCE of plasmon-enhanced photoanodes (Fig. 3b) demonstrate an increase in photocurrent in the visible for the Au@SiO2-NPs embedded photoanodes, and both visible and near-infrared for the Au–Ag@SiO2-NSs photoanodes. A slight decrease in photocurrent over the spectral range from 400–450 was observed attributable to reduction in the photon flux that reaches the TiO2 surface due to presence of the metal nanostructures. IPCE enhancement as a function of wavelength was obtained from by dividing the IPCE intensity of plasmon enhanced photoanodes by control photoanodes (Fig. 3c). IPCE enhancements correlate well with corresponding plasmon resonances of the embedded nanostructures. While photoanodes incorporated with Au@SiO2-NPs show 6× enhancement in the visible region consistent with that observed previously with AuNPs,38 photoanodes with Au–Ag@SiO2-NSs demonstrate a 14× enhancement distributed across the visible and near-infrared. We also performed chronoamperometric measurements at 0 V vs. RHE for both plasmon enhanced and non-enhanced photoanodes (Fig. S3†) and observed stable photocurrent over 30 minutes for both devices.
The increased photocurrent in the presence of plasmonic nanostructures is attributed to two phenomena: (i) metal nanostructures behave as antennas where the plasmonic near field is coupled to the semiconductor thereby increasing the total absorption cross-section, (ii) metal nanostructures serve as sub-wavelength scatterers to couple and trap solar energy into the absorbing semiconductor layer. Relative to spherical nanostructures, a higher concentration of charges are localized at the corners and edges of cubic and pyramidal morphologies due to the lightning-rod effect which gives rise to strong local fields that decay tens of nanometers from the nanostructure surface. For metal nanostructures in the 80–100 nm size regime the electric-field decay length is on the order of 10–20 nm.39 Since the silica shell of Au@SiO2-NPs and Au–Ag@SiO2-NSs is ∼5 nm, the near fields extend well-beyond the silica layer. These confined fields serve as a secondary light source, increasing optical interactions with proximal materials and resulting in a higher density of e−/h+ pairs than is possible with visible illumination alone. The bimetallic nanostructures (particularly nanocubes, see Fig. 2) have a high scattering cross-section, which also contributes to the enhanced photocurrent. Light scattered from nanostructures into the semiconductor beyond the critical angle of reflection passes several times through the semiconductor and remains trapped.5 This phenomenon increases the semiconductor optical path length and improves light absorption. Therefore both near-field and far-fields play a strong role in the total plasmonic enhancement. A third mechanism has also been proposed where following photo-excitation at the plasmon resonance, plasmons will decay by energetic relaxation generating e−/h+ pairs. These photo-excited electrons undergo electron–electron scattering resulting in a non-equilibrium “hot” electron distribution. The process of hot electron conduction in metal nanoparticles is dependent on the electron mean free path, λe, of the metal; for Au and Ag λe is on the order of 50 nm.40–42 This suggests for metal nanoparticles <50 nm hot electrons can rapidly transfer to the semiconductor near the metal surface (in the absence of an insulating barrier such as silica) and initiate efficient photochemical reactions.43–45 However, for metal nanoparticles >50 nm in size, such as the Au–Ag NSs and AuNPs used in this work, fewer hot electrons reach the metal surface due to scattering. The hot carriers that reach the Au/SiO2 interface must now pass the electron tunneling barrier, ϕb, of the insulating SiO2; for SiO2ϕb is <3 nm.46,47 Since the silica layer thickness of Au@SiO2-NPs and Au–Ag@SiO2-NSs is ∼5 nm, it is highly unlikely hot electrons will transfer to the surrounding TiO2, suggesting the hot electron mechanism does not play a role in our system. The higher enhancements by Au–Ag@SiO2-NSs also results from the dual plasmon resonances allowing broadband incident light absorption. We also note that the observed enhancements in photocurrent suggests that the nanostructures are within 10–20 nm from the semiconductor/electrolyte interface; since minority carrier diffusion length for TiO2 is on the order of 10–100 nm48–50 only e−/h+ pairs generated within this distance of semiconductor/electrolyte interface contribute to photocatalytic water splitting.
We also varied the concentration of Au–Ag@SiO2-NSs and Au@SiO2-NPs in the photoanodes to determine the dependence of particle density to photocurrents. Particle densities were determined by correlating the absorbance of nanostructures to weight of the dried nanostructures determined via thermogravimetric analysis. We observed a clear trend in nanostructure concentration dependence to photocurrent for both Au–Ag@SiO2-NSs and Au–Ag@SiO2-NPs (Fig. 4). Photocurrent density monotonically increased reaching a maximum at 0.00045 wt% Au–Ag@SiO2-NSs and then decreased with further increase in particle density. For Au@SiO2-NPs photocurrent reached a maximum at 0.1 wt% and then decreased and leveled off. To achieve similar photocurrent enhancements ∼245× fewer particles are needed for Au–Ag@SiO2-NSs relative to Au@SiO2-NPs which demonstrates significantly less material is required to achieve plasmonic enhancement of solar devices with bimetallic nanostructures relative to monometallic nanoparticles. The decrease in photocurrent at high particle concentrations is attributed to: (i) at high particle densities the total available photon flux reaching TiO2 is significantly decreased resulting in fewer e−/h+ pairs being generated; (ii) increasing concentration of metal increases e−/h+ recombination decreasing carriers available for photocurrent generation; and (iii) increased particle density promotes interparticle interaction between adjacent nanostructures giving rise to heat generation. The dissipation of this heat increases the phonon density relative to the carrier density available for photocurrent generation which reduced the current density of photoanodes.

Note: The maximum photocurrent densities are achieved with ∼245× less Au–Ag@SiO2 nanostructures relative to Au@SiO2 nanoparticles. Error bars were achieved from ∼4 photoanodes per concentration. 
To further understand the role of plasmonic nanostructures in increased charge carrier generation at the semiconductor surface, the photocurrents of the samples were analyzed by modulating intensity of the solar simulated light from 50 mW cm−2 to 300 mW cm−2. Photoanodes incorporated with Au–Ag@SiO2-NSs and Au@SiO2-NPs (Fig. 5) exhibit first-order intensity dependence, while control photoanodes show half-order intensity dependence. If the observed photocurrent is directly correlated to the concentration of h+ on the TiO2 surface, that indicates the surface concentration of h+ follows a first- and half-order dependence for the plasmon enhanced, and control photoanodes respectively. Studies have shown that e−/h+ pairs formed in the bulk of TiO2 shows a half-order dependence on photon flux, whereas charge carriers formed near the surface of TiO2 show a first-order dependence on light intensity.48,51,52 These results provide further evidence that in the nanostructure embedded photoanodes charge carriers generated near the surface of the TiO2 are primarily enhanced by the intense electromagnetic fields of the proximal plasmonic nanostructures. This effect is further augmented in the photoanodes integrated with Au–Ag@SiO2-NSs giving rise to higher photocurrent densities as a function of incident light intensity relative to the photoanodes with Au@SiO2-NPs.

The power dependence of the samples is: Au–Ag@SiO2α Intensity1.2, Au@SiO2α Intensity0.94, and TiO2α Intensity0.55. Error bars were achieved from 4 photoanodes measured at each light intensity. 
Conclusions
In conclusion, we compared the plasmon enhanced photocatalytic water splitting capability of Au–Ag bimetallic nanostructures with monometallic Au nanoparticles incorporated in mesoporous TiO2 photoanodes. Bimetallic nanostructures embedded photoanodes demonstrated significantly improved photocurrent densities relative to those with Au nanoparticles. Our experiments and simulations attribute these enhancements to the dual plasmon resonance of bimetallic nanostructures resulting in broadband absorbance of incident light across the visible and near-infrared, large electric field enhancements localized on the edges and corners of the nanostructures, and large scattering cross-sections resulting in enhanced optical absorption in the TiO2 photoanodes. These near-field and far-field properties of bimetallic nanostructures collectively result in an increased e−/h+ pair generation at the surface of the vicinal TiO2 particles; these charge carriers can subsequently separate and migrate to the semiconductor/electrolyte interface initiating photochemical reactions. We also observed to achieve similar photocurrent enhancements ∼245× less wt% of bimetallic nanostructures was required relative to Au nanoparticles in TiO2 photoanodes demonstrating that bimetallic nanostructures will ultimately enable thin film solar devices with enhanced efficiencies. Beyond water splitting, these bimetallic-semiconductor hybrid architectures can be generalized to a range of applications including solar cells, solid-state sensors, light induced CO2-to-fuel conversion, and photodetectors.

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  Transmission electron microscopy micrographs of (a) Au–Ag nanostructures and (b) after coating with ∼5 nm layer silica, (c) Au nanoparticles and (d) after coating with a ∼5 nm layer silica.	 

 	Fig. 2  Calculated absorption, scattering, and extinction spectra obtained from finite difference time domain simulations of (a) Au–Ag nanocubes, (b) Au–Ag nanopyramids, and (c) Au nanoparticles. (d) Experimental extinction spectra of Au@SiO2 nanoparticles with a plasmon resonance at 560 nm and Au–Ag@SiO2 nanostructures showing dual resonances at 535 nm and 630 nm. (e) Electromagnetic intensity profile, <E2/E02>, of (i) Au–Ag nanocubes, (ii) Au–Ag nanopyramids, and (iii) Au nanoparticles. Profiles were collected at the dipole resonance of each shape. A plane wave of intensity one was injected along the x-axis with propagation occurring along the y-axis. Color bars represent intensities of the resulting electric fields.	 

 	Fig. 3  (a) Absorption spectra showing enhancement in light absorption with Au–Ag@SiO2 nanostructures (blue) and Au@SiO2 nanoparticles (red) embedded within the mesoporous TiO2 photoanodes relative to TiO2 only anodes (control, black). (b) IPCE curves of non-enhanced (TiO2 only) and plasmon enhanced photoanodes. The plasmon enhanced photoanodes are at the optimized concentration. (c) Enhancement in photocurrent as a function of wavelength obtained from IPCE data of plasmon enhanced photoanodes relative to TiO2 only photoanodes. The error bars were obtained from >4 devices.	 

 	Fig. 4  The photocurrent enhancement of photoanodes as a function of particle concentration in wt% with (a) Au–Ag@SiO2 nanostructures, and (b) Au@SiO2 nanoparticles embedded within the mesoporous TiO2. Note: The maximum photocurrent densities are achieved with ∼245× less Au–Ag@SiO2 nanostructures relative to Au@SiO2 nanoparticles. Error bars were achieved from ∼4 photoanodes per concentration.	 

 	Fig. 5  Correlation of photocurrent to light intensity (power) of photoanodes with Au–Ag@SiO2 nanostructures (blue) and Au@SiO2 nanoparticles (red) embedded within the mesoporous TiO2 photoanodes relative to TiO2 only photoanodes. The power dependence of the samples is: Au–Ag@SiO2α Intensity1.2, Au@SiO2α Intensity0.94, and TiO2α Intensity0.55. Error bars were achieved from 4 photoanodes measured at each light intensity.
