    , Accepted 1st December 2022First published on 1st December 2022AbstractLead halide perovskite film exhibits excellent optoelectronic properties. The currently most common preparation method usually needs a conductive-annealing process, which inevitably leads to residual strain and defects, hindering the performance of the resulting perovskite solar cells (PSCs). In this work, we develop a residual strain regulation (RSR) strategy in which an appropriate amount of ligand-capped CsPbI3 quantum dot (QD) solution is used as the antisolvent during the preparation process of (CH(NH2)2)0.95Cs0.05PbI3 perovskite films. In this strategy, not only do the lattice-matching CsPbI3 QDs act as heterogeneous nucleation centers, but also the ligands attach to the perovskite film's surface, which significantly regulates the crystallization kinetics and releases the residual strain during the annealing process. The strategy successfully delivers multiple effects: an enlarged grain size, fewer defects, reduced nonradiative recombination and higher charge transfer efficiency. Therefore, the device shows a PCE of 23.32%, higher than that of a control device of 21.61%. First-principles calculations are performed to study the electronic structure of the perovskite films under strained conditions. We believe that this facile approach provides a novel strain engineering strategy for PSC technology.
1 Introduction
Lead formamidinium triiodide (CH(NH2)2PbI3, FAPbI3) with a narrow bandgap and thus a large spectral response has attracted widespread attention as an ideal light-absorbing material for perovskite solar cells (PSCs).1–6 Spin-coating and post-annealing procedures have been the most frequently employed methods to prepare perovskite films in the laboratory. However, the high-temperature annealing process inevitably causes various defects in the perovskite film,7,8 inducing trap-assisted nonradiative recombination and negatively affecting the charge carrier transportation and device performance.9–11 In addition, due to the thermal expansion coefficient mismatch between the perovskite layers and the substrate, residual strains are commonly observed in perovskite films.12,13 In particular, a higher annealing temperature, 150 °C, is required to form α-FAPbI3 compared with that for MAPbI3, which is usually 100 °C.2,14 Therefore, FAPbI3 films experience more severe tensile strain as they are cooled to room temperature due to the large temperature gradient and thermal expansion difference. The correlation between the stress (σ) and thermal expansion mismatch is quantified as follows:  where νp is Poisson's ratio in the perovskite, Ep is the modulus of the perovskite, ΔT is the temperature gradient from the annealing temperature of the perovskite film to room temperature, and αp and αs are the thermal expansion coefficients of the perovskite and the substrate, respectively.13 Perovskite films typically have a high thermal expansion coefficient (αp ≈ 10−4 K−1) and the substrate has a much lower αs, such as TiO2, SnO2, or NiOx with αs of 0.1 to 2 × 10−5 K−1.12,15,16 Residual tensile strain in perovskite films significantly affects the crystal phase stability, electronic band structure and carrier recombination.17–19 Several strategies have been introduced to reduce this detrimental tensile strain in perovskite films and they are summarized as follows: (1) lowering the formation temperature of the perovskite film or delicately modifying the annealing process to reduce ΔT.13 (2) Employing a modification layer on the substrate to decrease Δα.20–22 (3) Residual tensile strain compensation through interface post-treatment.12,23,24 For example, Zhu et al.13 modified the heat treatment process by flipping over the thin film sample to provide an inverse temperature gradient to reduce the tensile strain. A protonated amine silane coupling agent, pillowy alkyl ammonium bromide (PASCA-Br), was used to modify the substrate layer before the deposition of the perovskite film.21 The PASCA-Br terminals on the upper side of the interlayer provide well-matched growth sites for the perovskite, leading to mitigated interface strain and ensuing lattice distortion. Wang et al.23 developed an effective method to release the interfacial strain of the (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15 film through post-treatment of the film with an A-site cation. Different ammonium salts (n-butylamine hydroiodide, octylammonium hydroiodine, 2-phenylethylamine hydroiodide, and guanidine hydroiodide) are used as strain regulators. The incorporation of these organic A-site cations has been proved to construct “soft” structural subunits, which provide extra structural flexibility in the spatial perspective against lattice distortion. However, although many molecules have been explored, there are few multifunctional molecules that can passivate defects while providing strain-free perovskite films at the same time. Therefore, balancing the strain issue with perovskite film quality remains a challenge. For example, low-temperature thermal annealing usually results in reduced tensile strain, but more defects in the perovskite films, which are detrimental to device performance. Therefore, perovskite films that satisfy both strain-free and fewer trap state requirements are significant and promising for high-efficiency devices.
Here, a novel and effective residual strain regulation (RSR) strategy is introduced to simultaneously release residual tensile strain and passivate defects in FA-based perovskite films. We first use a hexane/methyl acetate (MeOAc) solvent treatment method to control the ligand amount of CsPbI3 QDs. Then the CsPbI3 QDs with an appropriate number of capping ligands are introduced into the antisolvent toluene to prepare a FA0.95Cs0.05PbI3 film. The CsPbI3 QDs act as nucleation centers, significantly regulating the crystallization kinetics to obtain high-quality and fewer trap state films, and the ligands attach to the perovskite film's surface to release residual strain during the annealing process. As a result, the treated films with enlarged grain size, fewer defects, reduced nonradiative recombination and higher charge transfer efficiency lead to a higher PCE of 23.32% compared to that of a control device of 21.61%. These results suggest that this approach is a promising tool to obtain strain-free and high-quality perovskite films for improving device performance in PSCs.
2 Results and discussion

Fig. 1a schematically presents the detailed process of fabricating perovskite films using a CsPbI3 QD toluene solution as the anti-solvent. A precursor solution of FA0.95Cs0.05PbI3 is spin-coated on the substrate. Then, the anti-solvent is quickly dropped onto the perovskite film being prepared. The film is subsequently annealed (150 °C, 20 min). The CsPbI3 QDs are synthesized via a typical hot injection reaction25,26 and the experimental details are included in the ESI.† Most often, combinations of long-chain amines with long-chain acids are used as ligands in the synthesis of CsPbI3 QDs. The number of ligands on the surface of the QDs is crucial to the charge transport and strain regulation of the perovskite films, but little attention has been paid to it. We first use a hexane/MeOAc solvent treatment method to control the ligand amount of the CsPbI3 QDs. Considering the stability and photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of the QD dispersion, we mainly focus on the device performance of the CsPbI3 QDs after treatment one, two and three times. Such control of the ligand density can be confirmed by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) characterization. Fig. 1b shows the full 1H NMR spectrum and Fig. 1c is the amplified 1H NMR spectrum at a chemical shift of 4.5 to 6.0. The origin of the resonance peak is shown in Fig. 1c, referring to previous work.27,28 The total concentration of the oleyl species (determined from resonance 5) gradually reduces as the number of treatment cycles increases. Treatment once is clearly insufficient, and the reaction solvent octadecene (ODE) remains as shown in Fig. 1c. This ODE and the excess surface ligands act as an insulation layer, affecting the electrical properties and the carrier transport capabilities. After treatment two times, some of the oleyl species (ODE, OA, OAm) are removed effectively, and the characteristic resonances of ODE almost disappear. When the treatment is repeated three times, most of the oleyl species are removed. However, excessive removal of surface ligands can adversely affect the PLQY and stability of the QDs.27 Furthermore, the gradual reduction in the number of the surface ligands is verified by FTIR analysis, as shown in Fig. S1.† The FTIR peaks located near 3000 cm−1 or below ∼2000 cm−1 are ascribed to C–C and C–H stretching modes26 belonging to oleylammonium, oleate, or octadecene, which exhibited an obvious decrease when the number of treatment cycles was increased. The surface ligand changes were also shown by the decrease of the relative peak intensity ratios of N/Cs, N/Pb, and N/I in the XPS measurements (Fig. S2†), and the mass loss in the range of 225 to 320 °C in the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) curves (Fig. S3†). The above characterization results prove that the hexane/MeOAc mixed solvent treatment can effectively remove the ligands around the CsPbI3 QDs.

Fig. S4a and b† show the optical absorption and PL spectra of the CsPbI3 QDs treated one, two, and three times. Both the absorption peak and the PL peak shift to the long-wavelength range as the ligand amount is reduced. The redshifts of the absorption and PL peaks mainly result from the growth of QDs after treatment. In the absence of sufficient ligand protection, the soft ionic crystal structure makes crystal growth easier. The PLQYs and PL lifetime of the CsPbI3 QDs after different washing times are shown in Fig. S4c and d.† The PLQYs of the CsPbI3 QDs decrease from 92.1% to 73.5% when the number of treatment times increases from one to three. The average carrier lifetimes are 227 ns, 138 ns, and 117 ns after treatment one, two, and three times, respectively, and the fitting results are shown in Table S1.† The average crystal size increases from 8.6 to 10.3 nm according to transmission electron microscopy (TEM) characterization, as shown in Fig. S5.† It is clear that the surface of the QDs has been destroyed, and aggregation occurs, inducing the creation of a large number of surface defects after treatment three times. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns reveal that the CsPbI3 QDs maintain a cubic phase after three cycles of purification, as shown in Fig. S6.† Such a purification process is expected to produce CsPbI3 QDs with the appropriate number of surface ligands. The application of these QDs with the appropriate number of surface ligands to the perovskite bulk materials enables more effective defect passivation and surface residual strain regulation of the perovskite film.
To investigate the effect of CsPbI3 QDs with different amounts of ligand on the crystal quality and morphology of the perovskite films, top-view SEM images of perovskite films fabricated with and without QDs are shown in Fig. 2a. We use the number of times of ligand treatment in the notation for the CsPbI3 QDs. Thus, QDs-I, QDs-II, and QDs-III represent the CsPbI3 QDs treated one two, and three times, respectively. All the perovskite films show a very uniform surface and the grain size of the films increases after the addition of QDs, indicating that the QDs are beneficial to the growth of the perovskite film. Upon addition of QDs-II, the average perovskite grain size reaches a maximum. We further employed atomic force microscopy (AFM) to study the surface roughness and morphology of the resulting perovskite films (Fig. 2b). The surface roughness of the perovskite films is reduced from 20.9 to 15.1 nm by introducing QDs-II. Clearly, the smooth surface is beneficial for the interface contact and the charge transfer at the perovskite/hole-transporting layer interface. The improved quality of the perovskite films upon the introduction of the CsPbI3 QDs can be further confirmed by XRD, as displayed in Fig. 2d. All the perovskite films have diffraction peaks at 14.1° and 28.2° corresponding to the (001) and (002) planes of FAPbI3, which is consistent with previous research results.29–32 This also indicates that the introduction of the CsPbI3 QDs does not change the phase and crystal structure of the perovskite films. The intensities of the (001) and (002) orientation peaks of the QD treated film are higher than those of the control film. It can be seen that the perovskite film with QDs-II exhibits the best crystallinity. The increases of the diffraction peak intensities and grain size indicate that the introduction of QDs-II in the toluene anti-solvent can manipulate the nucleation and growth process of the perovskite films. The CsPbI3 QDs provide an additional seed-like nucleation site, promoting the formation of the perovskite lattice structure, leading to significantly increased grain size and crystallinity of the perovskite films.33,34 Contact angle measurement of the control film and QD treated film was conducted as shown in Fig. 2c. The water contact angles on the left side are 69.8°, 96.9°, 98.4° and 98.2° for the control film, and QDs-I, QDs-II, and QDs-III treated films, respectively. The contact angles of the QD-treated films are larger than those of the control perovskite films, indicating that the ligands of the CsPbI3 QDs eventually cover the surface of the perovskite films.

Recent studies have indicated that perovskite films prepared by general methods are inevitably accompanied by tensile strain, which is harmful to the efficiency and stability of the PSCs.35,36 We utilized grazing incident X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) characterization with the 2θ–sin2(ψ) method to study the effect of CsPbI3 QDs with different numbers of treatment times on the strain of the perovskite film. The (012) plane at 31.6° is selected for strain analysis according to previous literature reports.21,36Fig. 3a shows the GIXRD of the control film with respect to the (012) crystal plane. Upon varying ψ from 10° to 50°, the scattering peaks gradually shift to the left, indicating an increase of the crystal plane distance d(012). This suggests that the control perovskite film is bearing tensile strain. When introducing CsPbI3 QDs into the perovskite films, the perovskite films suffer from compressive, zero, and tensile strain with QDs-I, QDs-II, and QDs-III treatment respectively, as shown in Fig. 3b–d. By fitting 2θ as a function of sin2ψ, we can calculate the strain, and the slope of the fitting line gives the residual strain. A negative slope indicates that the films bear tensile stress. As shown in Fig. 3e, the fitting line of the control film exhibits a slope with a negative value, while the slope changes from a negative value, to a zero value, to a positive value upon going from the QDs-III, to the QDs-II, to the QDs-I treated film, which implies that the macroscopic residual tensile strain gradually decreases.

Based on the above characterizations, we conclude that the number of ligands on the surface of the CsPbI3 QDs has remarkable effects on the strain of the perovskite films. The application of these QDs with the appropriate number of surface ligands to the perovskite bulk material enables more effective surface residual strain modulation of the perovskite film. We propose the following scenario to explain the mechanism of strain modulation in the perovskite films by the QDs. When toluene with CsPbI3 QDs is dropped onto the spinning precursor, the CsPbI3 QDs as nucleation centers promote the formation of the perovskite crystal structure and improve the film quality. During the FA0.95Cs0.05PbI3 film processing and subsequent annealing, ligands detach from the CsPbI3 QDs and self-assemble on the film surface, anchoring to Pb sites as confirmed by FTIR in Fig. 4a. The stretching vibration of the CO bond of the OA ligand in the pure CsPbI3 QDs appears at 1710 cm−1, while it shifts to 1750 cm−1 in the FA0.95Cs0.05PbI3 perovskite film, indicating an interaction between the ligands and perovskite film. To chemically confirm the existence of the ligands on the FA0.95Cs0.05PbI3 film surface, XPS measurements for the control films and QDs-II treated film are conducted as shown in Fig. 4b. The films are put in a vacuum chamber overnight to get rid of the possible impurities adsorbed from the environment before the XPS measurement. The QDs-II treated film shows an O 1s peak at 532 eV from the OA molecules but the control film does not show the corresponding peak. The ligands anchored on the perovskite surface provide an external effect to balance the tensile strain generated during the annealing process of the perovskite film. As shown in Fig. 4c, as the number of surface ligands increases, the interaction between the ligands and the surface of the perovskite film may gradually strengthen; thus, the perovskite films suffer from compressive, zero, and tensile strain with QDs-I, QDs-II and QDs-III treatment, respectively.

To investigate the influence of these different amounts of ligand-capped CsPbI3 QDs on the PSCs, we fabricated FA0.95Cs0.05PbI3 solar cells with a planar n–i–p device architecture: FTO/SnO2/FA0.95Cs0.05PbI3/spiro-OMeTAD/Ag. A schematic of the device structure and the corresponding cross-sectional SEM image of the actual device are shown in Fig. 5a. The thickness of the perovskite layer is about 400 nm, exhibiting intimate contact with both the electron-transporting SnO2 layer and the hole-transporting spiro-OMeTAD layer. First, we optimized the concentration of the CsPbI3 QDs for different treatment times in the antisolvent toluene, as shown in Fig. S7 and Tables S2–S4.† The optimal concentration of the QDs-I, QDs-II, and QDs-III is 2 mg mL−1. The J–V results (Fig. S8 and Table S5†) show that the best device with QDs-II treatment yields a PCE of 23.3% with a short-circuit current (Jsc) of 25.6 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.11 V, and a fill factor (FF) of 82.0%, higher than the optimized control device (which has a PCE of 21.6%, a Jsc of 24.8 mA cm−2, a Voc of 1.07 V, and an FF of 81.3%). Clearly, the increased PCE of the FA0.95Cs0.05PbI3 PSCs can be mainly ascribed to an improvement in both Voc and Jsc. Both QDs-I (with a PCE of 22.2%, a Jsc of 24.9 mA cm−2, a Voc of 1.08 V, and an FF of 82.1%) and QDs-III (with a PCE of 22.5%, a Jsc of 25.3 mA cm−2, a Voc of 1.08 V, and an FF of 82.2%) treated devices afford higher performance than the control PSCs, but lower performance than the PSCs with QDs-II treatment. These J–V results indicate that the CsPbI3 QDs have a positive effect on the performance of FA0.95Cs0.05PbI3 solar cells and the effect varies with the number of surface ligands. After treatment once, the presence of a large amount of ODE, OA, and OAm on the surface of QDs provides an insulating layer, reducing the carrier transporting capabilities. Therefore, the Jsc is lower than that for the QDs-II and QDs-III-treatment. When the treatment is repeated three times, the surface ligands are removed in excess, resulting in a large number of surface defects. These defects act as non-radiative recombination centers to reduce the PLQY and carrier lifetime of the QDs, decreasing the Voc of the PSCs. The statistical Voc of 20 devices with QDs-III treatment is lower than that for both the QDs-I and QDs-II treatments (Fig. S9†). Therefore, QDs with the appropriate number of ligands are the most effective.

(d) IPCE spectra of the control and QDs-II-treated PSCs. (e) The statistical distribution of PCEs for 20 devices fabricated with and without QDs-II treatment. 
The forward and reverse scanning J–V curves of the device with and without QDs-II treatment are shown in Fig. 5b, and the parameters are shown in Table 1. The hysteresis index (HI) defined by (PCEreverse − PCEforward)/PCEreverse of the QDs-II-treated device is 0.051, less than that of the control device (0.056). The steady-state power output of the best-performing devices with and without QDs-II treatment is measured at the maximum power point, as shown in Fig. 5c. The stabilized power output profile shows a Jsc of 24.8 mA cm−2 for the QDs-II treated device and 23.0 mA cm−2 for the control device, agreeing well with the J–V test. To further verify the Jsc as measured from the J–V sweep, we measured the device's incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) (Fig. 5d). The IPCE-derived Jsc is found to be 24.7 mA cm−2 for the QDs-II treated device, in agreement with the J–V measurement (deviation < 5%). Higher IPCE values across the whole absorption range can be observed for the solar cell with QDs-II treatment. Meanwhile, the cut-off edge in the long-wave direction of the IPCE curve exhibits a slight red-shift, enlarging the absorption edge for the QDs-II treated device. The increased EQE value and the broadened absorption range with QDs-II treatment are supported by UV-vis absorption spectra and the details are discussed below. The statistical PCE values from 20 devices (Fig. 5e) demonstrate the reproducibility and reliability of the performance enhancement upon introducing QDs-II into the anti-solvent. Such a high reproducibility can be partly attributed to the high-quality perovskite films crystallized with the involvement of the QDs-II. To evaluate the versatility of our approach beyond just FA-based compositions, we further applied the CsPbI3 QDs to all inorganic CsPbIBr2 solar cells with the detailed device performance shown in Fig. S10 and Table S6.† The CsPbIBr2 solar cells show improved PCEs with QDs-I, QDs-II, and QDs-III treatment compared to the control devices, suggesting the treatment with CsPbI3 QDs could also be an effective strategy for other perovskite compositions.

Next, a series of characterization techniques were employed to systematically investigate the changes of defect state, charge transfer and exciton recombination behavior in the film and device before and after the tensile strain release. First, we examined the steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) to study the charge carrier dynamics of the FA0.95Cs0.05PbI3 films as shown in Fig. 6a and b. The corresponding TRPL spectra are presented in Fig. 6b. The TRPL decay is fitted with a biexponential function containing a fast and a slow decay process,37,38 and the fitting results are shown in Table S7.† The PL intensities of the perovskite films with QDs-I, QDs-II, and QDs-III treatment were higher than that of the control one, which is in good agreement with the carrier lifetimes being enhanced from 770 ns for the control film to 1404 ns for the film with QDs-I treatment, 1460 ns for the film with QDs-II treatment, and 830 ns for the film with QDs-III treatment. The increased PL intensities and carrier lifetimes are ascribed to increased grain size, enhanced crystallinity, and improved morphology of the perovskite, indicating less non-radiative recombination compared to the control film.38–40 Then, we obtained electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements to reveal the charge transfer characteristics of the device. Fig. 6c presents the Nyquist plots of the devices obtained in the dark at a bias voltage of 0.9 V. The clear arc is involved in the charge recombination resistance (Rrec).41–43 The Rrec of the device with QDs-II treatment is the highest, revealing that the charge recombination process is suppressed, consistent with the improvement of Voc. Furthermore, the dark current–voltage characteristics further elucidate the charge recombination behavior in the device. As shown in Fig. 6d, the dark current density of the device with QDs-I, QDs-II, and QDs-III treatment is lower than that of the control device, demonstrating a lower leakage current, which is beneficial to the improvement of its Voc.44,45 Finally, the space-charge-limited-current (SCLC) technique was employed to estimate the defect state density of the perovskite films. Fig. 6e shows the dark current–voltage characteristics of the electron-only device with the structure FTO/SnO2/perovskite/PCBM/Au. The perovskite film with QDs-II treatment affords a lower electron defect state density of 1.04 × 1015 cm−3 than those of the control perovskite film (1.90 × 1015 cm−3), the films with QDs-I treatment (1.57 × 1015 cm−3), and the films with QDs-III treatment (1.32 × 1015 cm−3). Meanwhile, Fig. 6f displays the dark current–voltage characteristics of the hole-only device with the structure FTO/PEDOT:PSS/perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD/Au. The hole defect density of the QDs-II-treated film also has a lower value (1.09 × 1015 cm−3) than those of the control perovskite film (1.71 × 1015 cm−3), the QDs-I-treated film (1.61 × 1015 cm−3), and the QDs-III-treated film (1.20 × 1015 cm−3). The reduced trap density is related to the improved quality of the perovskite film. The above characterization data consistently demonstrate that the tensile strain-relieved films exhibit less defect-assisted non-radiative recombination and more efficient charge transport, resulting in higher device performance. We further tested the stability of unencapsulated films and devices stored in air (humidity: 50–55%, temperature: 25 °C). The color of the pristine FA0.95Cs0.05PbI3 film fades after 10 days, whereas there are no noticeable changes after 15 days in the perovskite film with QDs-I, QDs-II, and QDs-III treatment (Fig. S11†), indicating that the stability of the film with QDs treatment is greatly improved. The enhanced stability may be due to the hydrophobicity of the ligands on the surface of the perovskite films. The stability of the unencapsulated devices is shown in Fig. S12.† The FA0.95Pb0.05I3 solar cells with QDs-II treatment show good long-term stability during storage for 15 days and maintain 90% of their initial efficiency. Meanwhile, for the control device, a remarkably reduced PCE with increasing storage time is observed.

To reveal the underlying mechanism of the effect of strain release on solar cell performance, we performed first-principle calculations to study the electronic structure and optoelectronic properties of the perovskite films under strained conditions. We embedded (001) FAPbI3 films in a vacuum and applied 1% compressive strain and 1% tensile strain. The calculated band structures under tensile and zero strains are shown in Fig. 7a. The bandgap of the films decreases when the strain changes from tensile to zero. This is consistent with the experimentally obtained bandgap variation trend from UV-vis absorption and PL measurements. As shown in Fig. 7b and c, both the absorption and PL peaks of the QDs-II-treated perovskite films are red-shifted, implying a smaller bandgap in the strain-released perovskite films. The long-wavelength direction cut-off edge of the UV-vis absorption spectrum is consistent with the IPCE results in Fig. 5d. This bandgap variation trend can be explained by the band edge characteristics of halide perovskites, as shown in Fig. 7a. In halide lead perovskites, the valence band (VB) edge is governed by the antibonding between Pb-6s and halide (X)-p orbitals, while the conduction band (CB) edge is mostly determined by nonbonding localized Pb-6p orbitals.46,47 When the perovskite film experiences tensile strain, the in-plane lattice gradually expands. Therefore, the tensile strain effectively weakens the orbital coupling between Pb-6s and X-p, thus pulling down both the anti-bonding VB and CB energy levels. The VB with strong anti-bonding hybridization is substantially decreased. Therefore, a wider bandgap is observed for the tensile strain than in the case of the strain-free film. In addition, under tensile strain, the VB bends downward, which may lead to a “cliff-type” energy band alignment in the perovskite/hole transport layer as reported in the literature,13 which affects the hole transport efficiency. Therefore, after the tensile strain release, the VB is flattened, making charge transfer easier, which leads to a significant improvement in Voc in the corresponding device.

3 Conclusions
In summary, we demonstrated a strategy to simultaneously release strain and passivate defects in FA-based perovskite films. In a single step, the CsPbI3 QDs provide two important synergistic effects for the perovskite films: (1) CsPbI3 QDs play a role as nucleation centers in the growth process of the perovskite films to obtain a high-quality perovskite film; (2) the ligands anchored on the perovskite surface provide an external effect to balance the tensile strain. The strain-free and high-quality films with QDs-II treatment exhibit less defect-assisted non-radiative recombination and more efficient charge transport, resulting in higher device performance, leading to a higher PCE of 23.32% than that of the control device of 21.61%. This work provides a novel strategy to obtain strain-free and high-quality film for PSC technology.
