    , Accepted 13th September 2016First published on 13th September 2016AbstractIn this work, thulium and ytterbium codoped gadolinium molybdate (Gd2(MoO4)3:Yb/Tm) nanophosphors (NPs) have been synthesized, followed by being incorporated into a photo-catalytic titania (TiO2) nanoparticle layer. In detail, morphology and phase identification of the prepared NPs are first characterized and then the up-conversion of the Gd2(MoO4)3:Yb/Tm NPs is studied. Electron transfer dynamics after interfacing with bare or NP-doped electron donor TiO2 and the corresponding photovoltaic performance of solar cells are explored. The results show that Gd2(MoO4)3:Yb/Tm NPs excited at 976 nm exhibit intense blue (460–498 nm) and weak red (627–669 nm) emissions. The lifetime of electron transfer is shortened from 817 to 316 ps after incorporating NPs and correspondingly the electron transfer rate outstrips by 3 times that of the bare TiO2. Consequently, a notable power conversion efficiency of 4.15% is achieved as compared to 3.17% of pure TiO2/PTB7. This work demonstrates that the co-doping of robust rare earth ions with different unique functions can widen the harvesting range of the solar spectrum, boost electron transfer rate and eventually strengthen device performance, without complicated interfacial and structural engineering.
1. Introduction
Utilization of solar renewable energy has continued to receive wide attention and ongoing effort has been intensively invested into solar cells.1–5 However, one of the demerits or bottleneck issues limiting the further enhancement of photovoltaic devices is that the solar spectrum has not been fully utilized, i.e., those photons falling within 250–2500 nm ranging from ultraviolet to infrared. However, only a small fraction of the solar spectrum matching the band gap Eg of light absorbers has been utilized by photovoltaic devices. More than 70% energy loss is related to this so-called spectrum mismatch. Basically, there are two types of loss in solar energy, thus restricting power conversion efficiency. On the one hand, the high-energy photons of ultraviolet (UV) radiation (greater than Eg) are not efficiently harvested and the excess energy is dissipated in the form of heat (i.e., thermalization); on the other hand, the low-energy photons of infrared (IR) radiation are not exploited and lost in the form of transmission (i.e., non-absorbed losses).
One of the efficient and promising approaches to address this issue is the introduction of appropriate rare earth (RE) ions acting as downshift or upconversion (UC) converters into the light-harvesters to decrease such losses to a minimum. A downshift luminescent material can harvest high-energy photons, but emit visible light, which can be collected by solar cells. UC luminescent materials are capable of capturing two low-energy photons and converting them into one single photon that can be harvested in the visible region. Due to the excellent luminescence properties, such as sharp emission bands arising from their 4f electronic transition, of RE ions, especially lanthanide ions, much effort has been devoted to their application in optoelectronic devices, flat panel displays, and light emitting diodes acting as luminescent materials. It is known that among the RE ions, lanthanide ions are the most promising luminescent materials for photo-management, which can concentrate luminescence and enhance efficiency, due to their unique electronic structure. So far, much work has been conducted to improve efficiency via widening the absorption of the solar spectrum using trivalent lanthanide-doped materials.6–8
In a bid to utilize these advantages and design versatile luminescent materials with excellent thermal stability and mechanical properties, RE ions are usually doped into various semiconductor nanoparticles, such as TiO2 through co-precipitation or sol–gel techniques, or entrapped into different matrixes, such as crystalline phosphors or metal oxides. In fact, nanosized titania is one of the potential candidates to host trivalent RE ions such as ytterbium (Yb3+) and thulium (Tm3+) due to its strengths including facile manufacturing and outstanding thermal, chemical and mechanical properties and much effort has been put into the doping of RE ions into TiO2 lattice in order to enhance the photocatalytic performances. However, because of the mismatch of ionic radii, it is difficult to substitute Ti4+ for Ln3+.
Most UC RE ions can give out luminescence, notwithstanding that only host materials with low photon energy are capable of inhibiting intermediate state excitations from relaxing fast to lower lying levels, thus leading to valuable luminescence for hybrid solar cells (HSCs) to use.9 Hence much attention has been paid to the screening of host materials to reduce electron-photon coupling. So far, recent studies were most concentrated on fluoride and oxide host materials. Fluorides have lower photon energy compared to other materials, which make doped RE ions have longer level lifetime, resulting in more stable metastable levels.10–12 Nevertheless, most fluorides are highly toxic, and have poor chemical stability and poor mechanical strength, thus making them difficult for practical applications. In contrast, oxides, such as silicon oxides,13 titanium oxides14 and phosphorus oxides,15 have an edge over fluorides including their excellent chemical stability, high thermal stability (high melting point), facile preparation,16etc. However, the UC efficiency of RE oxides is low because of their inherent high-energy phonons. Transition metal (TM) ions have unique spectroscopic characteristics and electronic structures. Since both Yb and Tm have similar electronic structures and vdW radii to those of Gd, because all of them belong to the same lanthanide series of TM ions, it is easy for Yb/Tm to dope into the lattice of gadolinium molybdate.
Among the RE ions, special attention should be paid to trivalent gadolinium (Gd) ions since their excitations to high-energy states can result in efficient energy transfer from Gd3+ to other lanthanide ions, allowing the achievement of emission 6GJ → 6PJ in the visible range, thus gadolinium doping demonstrating enhanced emission.17–20 It is worth mentioning that host materials consisting of d-block transition elements (e.g., molybdate) outperform other host lattices due to their broad excitation band stemming from the charge transport in the UV region between O and Mo. Therefore, gadolinium molybdate (Gd2(MoO4)3, GMO) holds great promise in acting as host matrix. Furthermore, it also has a lot of advantageous properties including high photochemical stability, low toxicity, good thermal stability, etc.21 And other lanthanide ions have similar ionic radii to Gd3+, thus allowing relatively efficient doping of Ln3+ into the Gd3+ lattice. RE-doped GMO21,22 nanophosphors (NPs) have been widely synthesized for solar cell applications.
Ytterbium (Yb3+) ions have been incorporated into titania (TiO2) nanoparticles to enhance the photocatalytic activity23 or have been doped into RE oxides such as molybdenum oxides18 and yttrium lanthanum oxides24 for up-conversion of the solar spectrum, or enhanced fluorescence/luminescence.6–8 Thulium ions have also been used as dopants acting as downshift NPs.21 Thulium/ytterbium co-doping has been adopted in the fields of fibre laser and fiber amplifier applications.25–27 However, thulium/ytterbium co-doped GMO NPs have not been employed as downshift/up-conversion phosphors to enhance device efficiency.
Inorganic/organic HSCs,28–30 which utilize an organic conjugated polymer as the hole transport material and an inorganic semiconductor as electron transport material, have received continuing attention31–35 because of the potential of utilizing the individual advantages of both organic polymer and inorganic semiconductor, such as exploiting inexpensive and environmentally compatible materials and low-cost solution-processing.36–38 So far, the power conversion efficiency of solar cells still cannot meet commercial requirements, notwithstanding the advantages of the hybrid solar devices. Nowadays, much effort has been devoted to enhance the power conversion efficiency of PTB7/TiO2-based solar cells, such as by chemical modification of molecular structures of PTB7,39 synthesis of biomimetic leaf- or tree-like TiO2,40 or doping of TiO2.41 In particular, RE doping of TiO2 is widely used due to the easy manipulation and the dual role of UC and enhanced charge transfer rate arising from energy level engineering.42
Herein, we have synthesized Tm3+ and Yb3+ co-doped gadolinium molybdate NPs for the first time and demonstrated their versatile applications in organic/inorganic HSCs, in which TiO2 is used as electron acceptor and the well-known conducting polymer poly(thieno[3,4-b]thiophene/benzodithiophene) (PTB7)43 acts as electron donor. Briefly, the NPs were first characterized by X-ray diffractometry (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), then their up-conversion property and electron transfer dynamics were studied using time-resolved photoluminescence (PL), etc.; finally solar cells were fabricated by incorporating the prepared NPs.
2. Experimental
2.1 Synthesis of NPs and NP-doped TiO2
GMO NPs were prepared by a simple sol–gel method and different concentrations of RE ions relative to Gd3+ cations were doped. In detail, Gd2(MoO4)3:x mol% Yb3+/1 mol% Tm3+ (x = 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30) (denoted as GMO:xYb3+/1Tm3+) phosphors were prepared.
Pre-calculated amounts of Tm(NO3)3·6H2O (analytical regent, AR), Gd(NO3)3·6H2O (AR), Yb(NO3)3·6H2O (AR) and (NH4)6Mo7O24 (AR) were dissolved in deionized water to prepare solutions of particular concentration, followed by adding complexing agent citric acid (AR) to the solution (molar ratio of cation to citric acid at 1:1.5). Then, the pH value was adjusted to neutral (around 7) using ammonia (AR). Prior to further being calcined at 800 °C for 2 h in ambient atmosphere, the resulting solution was subject to stirring for 1 h and subsequent drying in air at 130 °C until transforming into a black bulk. Finally, the products were pressed into flat disks for further spectral analysis. TiO2 colloid and NP-doped TiO2 were prepared by procedures similar to those of previous works.44–46
2.2 Device fabrication
The TiO2 colloid was spin-coated on fluorine-doped tin oxide glass (FTO, Hartford Glass Co., USA) to obtain NP-doped or bare TiO2 acceptor layer with a particular thickness, which was then sintered in air. Then, FTO with TiO2 film was soaked in PTB7 toluene solution (0.15 mM) for loading of PTB7 molecules. Next, a poly(3,4-ethylenedioxylenethiophene)–poly(4-styrenesulfonic acid) (PEDOT:PSS, Aldrich) layer was spin-coated onto the bulk heterojunction (BHJ). Finally, by using thermal evaporation, a Pt electrode of 50 nm thickness was deposited on the top of the PEDOT:PSS layer under vacuum.
2.3 Characterizations
The phase identification of the prepared powder was performed with a MSAL XD-2/3 powder X-ray diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.1540596 nm) at 30 kV and 40 mA and at a scanning rate of 1 deg min−1. The morphology and microstructures of the NPs were examined using a JEM-2010 TEM instrument (JEOL Ltd) at different magnifications and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns were collected for analyzing the phase. In addition, the morphology of titania nanoparticles and the cross-sectional morphologies of corresponding photovoltaic devices were investigated with a field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, Hitachi S4800).
Photocurrent–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the assembled HSCs were explored with an Electrochemical Workstation (Xe Lamp Oriel Sol3A™ Class AAA Solar Simulators 94023A, USA) under irradiation of a simulated solar light from a 100 W xenon arc lamp in ambient atmosphere. Time-resolved PL spectra were collected with a spectrometer (Bruker Optics 250IS/SM) equipped with intensified charge coupled device detector (Andor, IStar740). The up-conversion emission spectra were recorded by an iHR550 spectro-fluorometer (Jobin Yvon) using excitation from a laser diode (LD) emitting at 976 nm.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Structural and phase analysis
In order to identify the structure and phase of the prepared NPs, XRD and TEM were used to confirm their fabrication. Fig. 1 shows the XRD pattern of GMO:15Yb3+/1Tm3+ NP, which is in good agreement with the standard diffraction pattern of monoclinic gadolinium molybdenum oxide (Gd2(MoO4)3) as per JCPDS no. 26-0655, in which a single monoclinic phase with the cell parameters of a = 7.53, b = 11.38, c = 11.40 Å and α = 90°, β = 109.28° and γ = 90° is evident and belongs to the space group of C2/c. Herein, the stronger diffraction peaks located at 34.32°, 28.42° and 29.4° well match those from the standard card, i.e., 34.358°, 28.218° and 29.356°, corresponding to the (2 0 2)/( 0 4), ( 2 1) and (0 2 3) planes, respectively.

Apart from XRD, TEM was also employed to characterize the morphology and phase identification of the prepared sample (Fig. 1b–d). As observed from Fig. 1b, the particle size of the NP is about 50–70 nm in diameter. According to the fringes in the high-resolution TEM image as shown in Fig. 1c, the evaluated distance spacings are 0.31 and 0.30 nm, corresponding to the crystalline planes of (−2 2 1) and (0 2 3) of the monoclinic Gd2(MoO4)3, respectively; and the angle between these two planes is estimated to be about 75.17°. More accurate results can be derived from SAED (Fig. 1d), where the calculated d-spacings are d1 = 0.266, d2 = 0.320, d3 = 0.310 nm, which well match the standard card corresponding to the indexed crystalline planes of R1 = (2 0 2), R2 = (−2 2 1) and R3 = (0 2 3), respectively. In our case, the angle between two planes corresponding to distance spacing equal to d1 and d2 is denoted as 〈R1, R2〉. Therefore, the estimated angles ϕExp between different planes are directly measured from Fig. 1d.
3.2 Up-conversion emission analysis
Up-conversion emission analyses of xYb3+/1Tm3+ co-doped GMO excited at 976 nm using a laser diode were performed at room temperature. The strong blue (460–498 nm) and weak red (627–669 nm) emissions are depicted in Fig. 2a, stemming from 1G4 → 3H6 and 1G4 → 3F4 (Tm3+), respectively. And the intensities of both the blue and red emissions increase with an increase of the concentrations of Yb3+ ions from 5 mol% and reach a maximum value at 15 mol%, followed by a slight decrease at higher concentrations, as highlighted in Fig. 2b. Therefore, the NP with 15 mol% Yb3+ (i.e., GMO:15Yb/1Tm) will be used for the following analysis of electron transfer dynamics and fabrication of solar cells.

The potential up-conversion mechanisms are illustrated in Fig. 3. The strong blue and weak red emissions of GMO:Yb3+/Tm3+ NPs could be ascribed to the formation of Yb3+–MoO42− dimer complex. It is known that there exists no energy level commensurate with the excitation wavelength of 976 nm in Tm3+ whereas the ground and intermediate excited states of Yb3+–MoO42− dimer are represented by |2F7/2, 1A1〉 and |2F5/2, 1A1〉, respectively; and the higher excited states are denoted by |2F7/2, 3T1〉, |2F7/2, 3T2〉, |2F7/2, 1T1〉 and |2F7/2, 1T2〉.47,48 Therefore, under excitation, the Yb3+–MoO42− dimer was first raised to intermediate excited state |2F5/2, 1A1〉 via ground state absorption (GSA). The subsequent step involves three energy transfers: (1) the first energy transfer (ET1) is the transfer of energy to the 3H5 level (Tm3+) which then decays non-radiatively to the 3F4 level; (2) the second one is another Yb3+–MoO42− dimer in close proximity transferring its energy to the 3F4 level of Tm3+ ion, thus exciting it to the 3F2 level (denoted as ET2 in Fig. 3), followed by decaying non-radiatively to the 3H4 level; (3) finally, Yb3+–MoO42− dimer transfers energy to Tm3+ ion, which thus is excited from the 3H4 level to the 1G4 level. The 1G4 level of Tm3+ ion gives the blue and red light emissions and then relaxes to the ground state 3F4 level. It is worth mentioning that the effective high excited state energy transfer (HESET) from the |2F7/2, 1T2〉 excited state (Yb3+–MoO42− dimer) to the 1G4 level readily happens because the accompanying phonon-assisted absorption can easily overcome the small band gap between |2F7/2, 1T1〉 and |2F7/2, 1T2〉. Such HESET mechanism can effectively mitigate the disadvantages of the exchange enhancement in the sensitization complex and lattice phonon quenching processes, thus resulting in the bright blue emission. Through the up-conversion process, the absorption cross-section can be widened and a much wider spectrum of solar energy can be utilized. Therefore, it will be helpful to collect more solar energy and leads to higher current density on the electrodes.

3.3 Electron transport dynamics
Charge transport at an interface is of importance to the charge collection in competition with charge recombination. In order to explore the promising role of NPs in boosting the charge transport at the donor–acceptor interface, time-resolved PL spectra of different films were obtained and the results are shown in Fig. 4. It can be observed that all the transient PL signals for the PTB7, PTB7/TiO2 and PTB7/NP-doped TiO2 films demonstrate clear contributions from the electronic hyper-polarizability near zero decay, but exhibit a complicated temporal profile at the positive time decay. Given the same experimental conditions, the PL signals were greatly decreased when the PTB7 is interfaced with bare or GMO:Yb3+/Tm3+ NP-doped TiO2 layer, indicating that strong charge transfer happens in the donor–acceptor systems. The decay transients in Fig. 4 are well fitted to a single-exponential decay using eqn (1), ϕ(t) = δ(t) + Aexp(−t/τ)(1)where δ(t) is the electronic hyperpolarizability and the second term represents the charge transfer, especially hot electron transfer. The fitted life times are τ = 1761, 817 and 316 ps for PTB7, PTB7/TiO2 and PTB7/NP-doped TiO2 films, respectively (Table 1). The electron transfer rate constant ket can be obtained from eqn (2), taking the form of (2)Thus, the corresponding averaged charge transfer rate after interfacing with electron acceptor (bare or doped TiO2) was estimated to be about 0.65 and 2.60 × 109 s−1 for bare and doped TiO2, respectively. Obviously, after the incorporation of NP into the TiO2 acceptor, the electron transfer rate has been significantly enhanced by 300% comparing with bare TiO2. One should bear in mind that although the accurate determination of such long life time remains a challenging task for time-resolved spectroscopy, nonetheless the errors introduced by τ do not affect the conclusions drawn in this work. During the photogeneration dynamics process, there are a lot of competing processes, such as exciton dissociation, hole–electron recombination and charge transfer at the interfaces, and the boosted charge transfer rate favors the collection of electrons on the electrode and consequently increases the current density of solar devices. Note that the fluorescent lifetimes of the RE NPs are long and usually of the order of milliseconds. However, the PL lifetime of PTB7 is much shorter, which is typically within several nanoseconds. Similar results have revealed that the electron–hole recombination time is about 1–3 ns,49,50 which agrees well with the present transient result, i.e., 1.7 ns. It is worth mentioning that attention in the present work is paid to the dual functions of Gd2(MoO4)3:Yb/Tm NPs in HSCs without giving emphasis to the intrinsic fluorescent lifetimes of the NPs. On the one hand, Gd2(MoO4)3:Yb/Tm NPs are capable of converting near-infrared (NIR) photons into blue or red ones, which can be recaptured by PTB7 absorber. On the other hand, the tiny NPs can occupy the redundant space of the porous TiO2, thus favouring the intimate contact between TiO2 and PTB7 following the physical adsorption of PTB7 molecules by virtue of intermolecular attractive forces. Finally, a better interface match between PTB7 and TiO2 is formed, leading to a facile photoexcited charge transfer.

3.4 Device performance
In a bid to demonstrate the effect of the boosted electron transfer arising from incorporation of NPs, a series of photovoltaic devices have been fabricated at different loadings of NPs ranging from 0 wt% to 12 wt%. The solar cells were assembled by sequential deposition or adsorption of bare or doped TiO2, PTB7, PEDOT:PSS and Pt on FTO substrate. A schematic diagram of the solar cell architecture is displayed in Fig. 5a. In order to reveal the role of that the NP plays in the final spectrum response in a direct way, external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements were performed as shown in Fig. 5b. The EQE spectra both with and without NP doping closely resemble the absorption profile of PTB7. However, an obvious broad EQE improvement ranging from 350 to 800 nm is observed after introducing Gd2(MoO4)3:Yb/Tm NPs. The enhanced EQE for NP doping throughout the absorption spectrum is consistent with widened absorption cross-section and the faster charge transfer rate after incorporation of NPs as discussed above. Unfortunately, due to the wavelength limitation of the EQE instrument in the NIR range, we cannot provide explicit evidence of the NP-induced improvement in the NIR spectrum. However, the up-conversion properties of the NPs that can convert NIR photons into red or green ones, together with the good light utilization ability of PTB7 in the visible range, will undoubtedly lead to a better performance of the assembled HSCs based on NPs:TiO2/PTB7.
 Fig. 5  (a) Schematic of the HSC. (b) EQE spectra of the HSCs with and without NPs and the UV-visible absorption spectrum of PTB7. 
The recorded photocurrent-voltage of the assembled solar cells is shown in Fig. 6a. The open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current density (Jsc) and filling factor (FF) at different loadings of NPs were calculated (Table 2). With an increase of the loading amounts of GMO:15Yb3+/1Tm3+ NPs, the short-circuit current density (Jsc) increases gradually and reaches a peak at 9 wt%, followed by a slight decrease at 12 wt%; in contrast, both Voc and FF remain almost unchanged. Consequently, the power conversion efficiency increases from 3.17% at 0 wt% to 4.15% at 9 wt% and this enhancement can be mainly ascribed to the following two aspects: on the one hand, after photogenerated excitons have been dissociated into electrons and holes, in competition with electron–hole recombination, the improved electron transfer rate favors more efficient electron extraction from donor to acceptor and eventual charge collection at the electrode, thus leading to higher current density; on the other hand, the PL spectra of RE ion-doped NPs were excited at 976 nm, followed by emissions in the visible light range. Combining the excitation and emission spectra, the NIR radiation can be absorbed by the donor material in the HSCs via UC luminescence, which widens the light absorption range of the HSCs.

In addition, the porous structure of the TiO2 layer revealed by SEM images (Fig. 6b and c) is prone to favor the absorption of PTB7 molecules and the loading of GMO:15Yb3+/1Tm3+ NPs. A large amount of PTB7 molecules have been well penetrated into the porous structure of TiO2 as depicted in Fig. 6d, which exhibits the intimate contact between PTB7 and TiO2 under the influence of intermolecular attractive forces51–53 and benefits electron transfer at the interface. However, with an increase of loading amount, especially exceeding 12 wt%, the short-circuit current density decreases. This can probably be ascribed to the difficulties in preparing a flat film, which thus could probably influence the interfacial engineering between adjacent layers within the photovoltaic devices.
4. Conclusions
In summary, thulium and ytterbium co-doped GMO NPs have been successfully prepared and their versatile properties including up-conversion emission and electron transfer dynamics have been explored in detail. After introducing RE ions into GMO NPs, intense blue and weak red emissions have been clearly observed after being excited by infrared light of 976 nm; and the concentrations of Yb3+ in the GMO NPs have been optimized to be 15 mol%. Moreover, after the incorporation of GMO NPs, a significant reduction in electron transfer lifetime from 817 to 316 ps has been clearly achieved, and correspondingly, the electron transfer rate has been enhanced by 300% from 0.65 to 2.60 × 109 s−1. Additionally, after incorporating GMO:15Yb/1Tm into solar cells, the photovoltaic performances have been significantly enhanced with the best being exhibited at a loading of 9 wt%. Jsc steadily increased from 3.17% at 0 wt% to 4.15% at the optimum loading of 9 wt% whereas both Voc and FF keep almost unchanged, which corresponds to a striking 30.9% enhancement. This work underlines the effect of incorporating RE ions into inorganic/organic HSCs via the regulation of harvesting of the solar spectrum and boosting electron transfer and throws some light on the engineering role for various optoelectronics, such as polymer-based, dye-sensitized or probably even perovskite photovoltaic devices.
