    , Accepted 18th July 2020First published on 20th July 2020AbstractLight irradiation can affect electronic properties of catalysts and the introduction of appropriate light into electrocatalysts may have a significant impact on the electrocatalytic process; however, this has not been fully studied. Herein, we propose a photo-activated process cascaded electrocatalysis for CO2 reduction to produce syngas over a core–shell ZIF-8@Co/C catalyst. Under light irradiation, the onset potential and overpotential of ZIF-8@Co/C positively shift by 40 and 200 mV, and the syngas production is enhanced 5.2-fold at a bias potential of −0.9 V vs. RHE. It is noteworthy that the electric energy efficiency is enhanced by 30%. Deducting syngas generated by electricity, the solar-to-syngas conversion efficiency (joule to joule) is as high as 5.38%, which outperforms reported photoelectrochemical systems. These devices also relatively maintain high efficiency in neutral pH aqueous solution. Dedicated experiments and in situ transient photovoltage studies demonstrate that the cascaded photo-activation of CO2 and H+ in electrocatalysis accounts for the outstanding catalytic performance.
1. Introduction
Excessive utilization of limited fossil fuels accompanied by heavy emission of CO2 has aggravated the global energy crisis and environmental burden.1–3 The electrochemical reduction of CO2 to useful chemical stocks or fuels, such as syngas, provides a promising technology in realizing the circular carbon-neutral cycle.4–6 Over the past several years, substantial progress has been made in understanding the transformations of CO2 as it is a kinetically sluggish and intricate reduction process with a high energy barrier. Particularly, the activation of CO2 molecule, which requires a reduction potential of −1.9 V (versus standard hydrogen electrode [SHE]) to reduce the linear CO2 to bent radical anion , has a high energy barrier.7,8 Although multi-proton-assisted electron-transfer processes can drive the relatively low activation energy barrier, the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) remains thermodynamically and kinetically difficult.9,10 For example, the thermodynamic equilibrium potential for CO2 reduction to CO is up to −0.11 V vs. RHE, which is quite higher than methane, hydrocarbons and alcohols.11 A substantial amount of additional potential is required to drive the CO2RR. Therefore, a deeper understanding of electrocatalyst-CO2 activation and the associated kinetics is still needed and will lead to more detailed strategies to design CO2RR catalysts with low overpotential. Notably the light irradiation may affect the electronic properties of catalysts, such as the Fermi level, electron transfer, charge distribution and desorption energy of intermediates, and even influence the catalytic pathways.12 However, it is difficult to control these changes induced by light orientation and affect the specific steps of catalysis in CO2 reduction. When light irradiation is cascaded directly with the key electrocatalytic step, it can substantially reduce the overpotential and reduce the cost of electric energy. However, few studies have investigated the influence of light on CO2 electroreduction.
Recently, metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) have been considered as immense potential catalytic materials in the field of electrocatalysis due to their well-defined composition, large specific surface area, permanent porosity and various catalytic centers.13,14 Using a classical MOF-based material as the catalyst, herein, we report a strategy of photo-activated process cascaded electrocatalysis for highly efficient CO2RR to produce syngas. A core–shell ZIF-8@Co/C catalyst with hierarchical porous structure was designed based on the following considerations: (i) the Co/C shell guarantees excellent light absorption and electrical conductivity; (ii) mesopores on the shell facilitate the diffusion of substrates; (iii) the ZIF-8 core that acts as a CO2 electrocatalyst is inexpensive (0.8$/g) and conveniently synthesised.15 ZIF-8@Co/C with different shell thicknesses was synthesized by partial pyrolysis of the corresponding ZIF-8@ZIF-67. Without conductive agents, ZIF-8@Co/C exhibits outstanding electrocatalytic performance with a Faraday efficiency of syngas (mixture of CO and H2) generation of nearly 100% at −1.2 V vs. RHE. Under light irradiation, the onset potential positively shifts by 40 mV, the current density increases by 1.6-fold and the syngas production is elevated by 5.2-fold at a bias potential of −0.9 V vs. RHE together with a decreased overpotential of 200 mV for a similar yield value and a 30% enhancement of the electric energy efficiency. Significantly, the conversion efficiency (joule to joule) of solar energy to syngas (deducting the syngas generated by electricity) reaches 5.38%, which outperforms reported photoelectrochemical systems. Combined with dedicated electrochemical tests and in situ transient photovoltage (TPV) studies, we clearly show that ZIF-8 is more likely to produce CO, while Co/C mainly generates H2 and acts as the main source of photo-induced electrons. The generated photo-induced electrons can transfer in an oriented fashion from Co/C to ZIF-8 to trigger CO2 activation because of the opposite charges between the shell and core of the ZIF-8@Co/C catalyst. This photo-activated process cascaded electrocatalysis significantly reduces the overpotential of electrochemical CO2 reduction (see Scheme 1) and leads to high catalytic performance.

2. Experimental section
Materials
Zinc nitrate hexahydrate (Zn(NO3)2·6H2O) and 2-methylimidazole (2-MeIm) were purchased from the Shanghai Census Bio-tech Co., Ltd. Cobalt chloride hexahydrate (CoCl2·6H2O) and methanol were bought from the Fuchen Chemical Reagent Factory in the city of Tianjin and Beijing Chemical Works, respectively.
Preparation of the serial of ZIF-8@ZIF-67-x16 and ZIF-8@Co/C-x (x = 1 to 5)
ZIF-8 (80 mg) seed was dispersed in 10 mL of methanol and ultra-sonicated for 30 min. Then, a methanolic solution of CoCl2·6H2O (177 mg, 3 mL) and a methanolic solution of 2-MeIm (895 mg, 3 mL) were slowly dropped into the above mixture. Subsequently, the mixture was transferred into an autoclave and maintained at 100 °C for 12 h. The resulting sample was named ZIF-8@ZIF-67-4 and was collected by centrifugation after cooling, then washed several times with methanol and dried at 80 °C. The other ZIF-8@ZIF-67-x samples (x = 1, 2, 3, and 5, where x is defined as the number of the sample) with different thicknesses of the ZIF-67 shell were prepared by adjusting the amounts of CoCl2·6H2O, 2-MeIm and methanol; the specific amounts are shown in Table S1.† The synthetic method was similar to that of ZIF-8@ZIF-67-4.
ZIF-8@Co/C-x (x = 1 to 5) was obtained by partial pyrolysis of the corresponding ZIF-8@ZIF-67-x (x = 1 to 5). The realization of partial pyrolysis is attributed to the difference in the pyrolysis temperatures of ZIF-8 and ZIF-67.17 To be specific, the powder of ZIF-8@ZIF-67-x was placed into a ceramic boat and transferred into a tube furnace. Then, the powder was heated to 550 °C and maintained for 8 min under flowing N2. Upon cooling to room temperature, the ZIF-8@Co/C-x (x = 1 to 5) was fabricated. The pyrolysis process of ZIF-8 and ZIF-67 was similar to that of the above samples.
Electrochemical measurements
The light-irradiation-cascaded electrochemical reduction of CO2 was executed in an H-type cell (Nafion 117 membrane) with a typical three-electrode system. A Pt sheet, an Ag/AgCl electrode (filled with 3 M KCl) and glassy carbon electrode (GCE) or carbon paper acted as the counter electrode, reference electrode and working electrode, respectively.
The working electrodes for the light-irradiation-cascaded electrochemistry experiments were prepared as follows: the catalyst (5 mg) was first dispersed in Nafion solution (1.0 mL 0.5%) and ultra-sonicated for 1 h to generate a homogeneous ink. Then, the catalyst (20 μL) was dropped onto two sides of carbon paper (0.5*1.0 cm2) and dried under air atmosphere. K2SO4 aqueous solution (0.25 M) was used as the electrolyte according to the reported literature. Before the tests, the electrolyte was purged with CO2 (or Ar) for 30 min (pH 4.65, CO2-saturated K2SO4 solution). During the measurements, the working electrodes were irradiated by a xenon lamp equipped with an AM 1.5 filter. According to the Nernst equation E (RHE) = E (Ag/AgCl) + 0.197 + 0.0591 × pH, all the potentials were calibrated to a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). The products of CO2 electrochemical reduction were detected with a gas chromatograph (GC) (GC2014, Shimadzu, Japan) equipped with FID and TCD detectors. The process of electrochemical measurement was similar to the light-irradiation-cascaded electrochemical tests except that the working electrode was changed and no illumination was provided. In this system, GCE (diameter, 3 mm) coated with ZIF-8@Co/C (5 mg mL−1, 8 μL) was used as a working electrode. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were carried out on CHI760 equipment in a frequency range from 100 kHz to 0.01 Hz at a potential of −0.9 V (vs. RHE).

In situ transient photovoltage (TPV) measurements
Under room temperature, the transient photovoltage measurements were carried on films of samples deposited on indium–tin oxide (ITO) glass substrates (1 cm × 1 cm). Films of the samples were prepared by dispersing the samples (5 mg) in 1.0 mL aqueous solution (700 μL water, 250 μL ethanol and 50 μL of Nafion solution); then, the aqueous sample was dropped on ITO slides and dried in air. The ITO glass modified with the samples as the working electrodes and Pt wire as the counter electrode were wetted with acetonitrile/H2O (v/v = 4:0.5). The samples were excited by a laser radiation pulse (wavelength 355 nm, pulse width 5 ns) from a third-harmonic Nd: YAG laser (Polaris II, New Wave Research, Inc.).
3. Results and discussion
Material characterization
A series of core–shell ZIF-8@ZIF-67-x samples (x is defined as the sample number from 1 to 5) with different shell thicknesses were prepared according to reported methods,16 and ZIF-8@Co/C-x was obtained through partial pyrolysis of ZIF-8@ZIF-67-x (Fig. 1a). The PXRD (powder X-ray diffraction) patterns of ZIF-8@ZIF-67-x aligned well with that of bare ZIF-8 or ZIF-67, as the patterns of ZIF-8 and ZIF-67 are similar (Fig. S1a†).16,18 After pyrolysis, ZIF-8@Co/C-x maintained the pristine PXRD pattern of ZIF-8@ZIF-67-x due to the intact structure of the ZIF-8 core (inset a of Fig. S1b†); however, a new weak peak appeared at about 44.9° (Fig. S1b†), which can be ascribed to cobalt nanoparticles (CoNPs, JCPDS no. 15-0806) resulting from the decomposition of ZIF-67 (inset b of Fig. S1b†).19,20

(b) TEM image, (c) HRTEM image, (d) line-scanning spectrum and (e) elemental mapping of ZIF-8@Co/C-4: Zn (purple) and Co (yellow). 
The TEM images of ZIF-8@Co/C-x (x = 1 to 5, Fig. 1b and S3a†) retain the rhombic dodecahedron morphology of ZIF-8@ZIF-67-x (x = 1 to 5, Fig. S2a†), except for the emergence of rough edges. A high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image of a rough edge (Fig. 1c) reveals two types of lattice fringes with d-spacings of 0.21 and 0.36 nm, which belong to CoNPs (111) and graphitic carbon (002),21,22 respectively, from the decomposed ZIF-67 shell. The elemental mappings (Fig. 1e and S3c†) of Zn and Co in ZIF-8@Co/C-x show that they are separately distributed in the centre and edges, as in ZIF-8@ZIF-67-x (Fig. S2b†); this suggests that ZIF-8@Co/C-x maintains its core–shell structure.16,23 The gradually increased Co content represents the incremental thickness of the Co/C shell. The molar ratios of Co2+/Zn2+ were probed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and the thicknesses of Co/C in ZIF-8@Co/C-x were obtained through line scans (Fig. 1d and S3b†), as depicted in Table S2.†
For all ZIF-8@ZIF-67-x (x = 1–5), the N2 adsorption–desorption curves (Fig. 2a and S4†) are type-I isotherms, which indicates that ZIF-8@ZIF-67-x is a microporous material with pore sizes mainly distributed in the range of 1–2 nm (Fig. 2b and S5†). The thickness of the shell has little effect on the N2 adsorption–desorption or the pore size distribution of ZIF-8@ZIF-67-x. In contrast, the N2 adsorption–desorption curves of ZIF-8@Co/C-x (x = 1–5) are all type-IV isotherms with H3-type hysteresis loops, indicating the existence of abundant mesopores (Fig. 2a and S4†).17,24,25 With increasing shell thickness in ZIF-8@Co/C-x, the adsorption capacity of nitrogen decreases gradually, which is due to the reduction of the specific surface area originating from the transformation of a certain amount of micropores into mesopores after calcination. It is obvious that when the shell thickness is lower than 50 nm, the pore size distribution of ZIF-8@Co/C-x (x = 1–4) is not affected by the shell thickness, and there are two pore size ranges of 1–2 nm and 3–4 nm. However, when the thickness of the shell is larger than 110 nm (ZIF-8@Co/C-5), mesopores in the size range of 2–3 nm emerge (Fig. 2b and S5†). In a word, ZIF-8@Co/C-x (x = 1–5) exhibits a hierarchical pore structure, which can facilitate the transport of CO2 (aq) or CO2RR relevant species in solution.26,27 The specific surface area of ZIF-8@Co/C-x (x = 1–5) reduces by 1%, 8%, 30%, 40% and 80% in comparison with that of ZIF-8@ZIF-67-x (x = 1–5), as shown in Table S3.† This decrease is likely due to the increased mesoporous ratio in ZIF-8@Co/C-x. The CO2 adsorption capacity of ZIF-8@Co/C-4 was measured to be ∼10.8 cm3 g−1 (0.44 mmol g−1) at room temperature and 1.0 atm (Fig. S6a†), suggesting that the hierarchical pores offer accessible sites for the adsorption or capture of CO2 molecules.26 X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) of ZIF-8@Co/C-4 reveals the predominant existence of C, N, O, Co and Zn elements (Fig. S6b†). The high-resolution XPS spectra at Co 2p and Zn 2p in Fig. 2c suggest that Co0 and Zn2+ species exist in ZIF-8@Co/C-4, which corroborates the existence of CoNPs28–30 and ZIF-8.31 The presence of the CoNPs can be further witnessed from the magnetism of the samples in a video (ESI†). Diffuse reflectance ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy was used to investigate the optical absorption abilities of the catalysts. In contrast to the two absorption bands in ZIF-8@ZIF-67-4 (200-350 and 450-650 nm), the UV-Vis spectrum of ZIF-8@Co/C-4 expands the absorption to the whole visible light range (400–800 nm) with high intensity (Fig. 2d). Considering that ZIF-8 only absorbs light in the ultraviolet region (Fig. S6c†), the visible-light absorption of ZIF-8@Co/C-x (x = 1 to 5, Fig. S6c†) mainly originates from the Co/C shell. This excellent light absorption ability of ZIF-8@Co/C may be a prerequisite for the response to light irradiation. The graphitic degrees of ZIF-8 and ZIF-8@Co/C-x (x = 1 to 5) were investigated by Raman spectroscopy (Fig. S6d†). As can be seen, ZIF-8@Co/C-x (x = 1 to 5) shows an obvious peak at about 1500 cm−1 and a weak peak near 1300 cm−1, which are ascribed to the G band and D band of carbon materials, respectively, and indicate a high degree of graphitization in the samples.32 This structure may lead to high conductivity, which conforms to the design requirements for electrocatalysts. However, there are no similar peaks in the Raman spectrum of ZIF-8, reflecting that the disordered carbon and graphite carbon originate from pyrolytic ZIF-67.

The electrocatalytic CO2 reduction
The electrochemical performance of ZIF-8@Co/C was firstly evaluated on glassy carbon electrode (GCE) in K2SO4 (0.25 M, pH 4.65) aqueous solution by following a reported model.33 As a control, the performance of bare ZIF-8 and Co/C was also studied. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves at 10 mV s−1 from −0.3 to −1.3 V vs. RHE were first tested to evaluate the electrocatalytic performance (Fig. 3a and S7†). The current density of these samples in Ar can be ascribed to the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER).34 ZIF-8@Co/C-x (x = 1 to 5) and ZIF-8 exhibit a higher current density in CO2 than in Ar, while Co/C does not present any obvious difference; this implies that the active site for CO2RR in ZIF-8@Co/C is ZIF-8. Comprehensive product analysis by gas chromatography (GC) revealed that CO and H2 are the main gas products. Also, an isotopic experiment was performed using 13CO2 labeling; the 13CO signal (m/z = 29) demonstrates that the carbon source of CO indeed derives from the CO2 used (Fig. S8†). Based on the above, we preliminary conclude that ZIF-8 is the main active site of CO generation while Co/C is the centre of H2 production. In order to further illustrate this conclusion, the yields of CO and H2 were detected on ZIF-8 and Co/C at −1.2 V vs. RHE. As shown in Fig. S14,† H2 generated by Co/C on GCE is 53.1 times that of ZIF-8, while CO generated by ZIF-8 is 18.7 times that of Co/C, indicating the truth of the above conclusion.
 Fig. 3  Electrochemical properties of the various catalysts for CO2RR on GCE. (a) The LSV responses of ZIF-8, ZIF-8@Co/C-4 and Co/C in 0.25 M Ar- and CO2-saturated K2SO4. (b) Faradaic efficiencies of CO and H2 and the corresponding proportions of syngas (CO/H2) on ZIF-8@Co/C-x (x = 1 to 5) at −1.2 V vs. RHE. 
It was found that at an optimized applied potential of −1.2 V vs. RHE, the faradaic efficiency (FE) of CO (Fig. S9a†) was negatively correlated to the thickness of the ZIF-8@Co/C shell, while the FE of H2 showed the reverse (Fig. S9b†). The reason for this result may be that the enhanced thickness of the Co/C shell limits the diffusion of CO2 to centre ZIF-8 but provides more active sites for H2 production. These results testify that the molar ratios of CO/H2 are definitely related to the composition of the catalyst and can be tuned in a large range from 3:1 to 1:5 (Fig. 3b). It is noteworthy that the FE(CO+H2) values of these catalysts are all close to 100%. Compared with the performance of reported electrocatalysts (summarized in Table S4†) toward syngas generation, the wide range of CO/H2 ratios achieved on ZIF-8@Co/C-x is outstanding and is beneficial to satisfy the demands for various industrial applications; for example, H2: CO = 0.3–1 is used for syngas fermentation and H2: CO ≥ 2 is an important raw material for methanol synthesis or Fischer–Tropsch reactors.35–38
ZIF-8@Co/C-1 was taken as a representation of ZIF-8@Co/C-x to investigate the long-term stability. The electrocatalytic stability was evaluated by continuous electrolysis of CO2 at −1.2 V vs. RHE for 8 h (the gaseous product was analysed by GC every 1.5 h), during which no prominent deactivation of the current density and stable FE for CO and H2 were observed, as shown in Fig. S10.† This durability indicates that ZIF-8@Co/C-x is a promising electrocatalyst for persistently producing a wide proportion of syngas during the CO2 reduction process.
Light-irradiation-cascaded electrochemical CO2 reduction
To evaluate the influence of light, a xenon lamp with an AM1.5 filter was used. For the convenience of light irradiation, the catalyst was dispersed on carbon paper instead of GCE in the light-irradiation-cascaded electrocatalysis. First, taking ZIF-8@Co/C-4 as an example, LSV curves were tested under both dark and light conditions to evaluate the electrocatalytic properties for CO2 reduction on carbon paper. As a control, the LSV curves of pure ZIF-8 and Co/C were also detected. The current density of ZIF-8@Co/C-4 on carbon paper was higher in CO2 than in Ar both in darkness (Fig. 4a) and under light irradiation (Fig. S11a†). Also, the trend of the LSV curves for ZIF-8 (Fig. S11b†) is similar to that of ZIF-8@Co/C-4, suggesting that ZIF-8 and ZIF-8@Co/C-4 have catalytic activity for electrochemical CO2 reduction. For Co/C (Fig. S11c†), the current density in CO2 was almost identical to that in Ar; therefore, the active site for CO2RR in ZIF-8@Co/C may be ZIF-8. The trends of the LSV curves above are all in agreement with that on GCE, indicating that the carbon paper does not affect the CO2RR activity of the catalysts. With light irradiation, the LSVs of ZIF-8@Co/C-x on carbon paper were obtained and show greatly enhanced electrochemical activity in contrast to those obtained in the dark under similar conditions; this is mainly reflected in the increased current density and the positive shift of the onset potential (Fig. 4a and S12†). The current density of ZIF-8@Co/C-x (x = 1 to 5) is enhanced by 1.1 to 1.6-fold at −1.3 V vs. RHE in comparison with that in the dark. The onset potential of ZIF-8@Co/C-x (x = 1 to 5) positively shifts by 20 to 40 mV. Among the samples, ZIF-8@Co/C-4 presented the best performance, with a 1.6-fold increase in current intensity and 40 mV shift of the onset potential. The significantly reduced onset potential in the electrocatalysis suggests that the introduction of light helps reduce the energy barrier of CO2 activation. The best performance of ZIF-8@Co/C-4 can be ascribed to the appropriate thickness of its shell for light absorption and electron transport.

(a) LSV curves of ZIF-8@Co/C-4 in Ar-saturated 0.25 M K2SO4 in the dark (black line) and CO2-saturated 0.25 M K2SO4 under illumination (orange line)/dark (gray line). The inset shows the change of the onset potential (1 mA cm−2) after illumination in CO2-saturated 0.25 M K2SO4. (b) The curves of the production rates for CO and H2 on ZIF-8@Co/C-4 at different potentials under illumination (orange)/dark (gray). (c and d) The production rates of (c) CO and (d) H2 on ZIF-8@Co/C-x (x = 1 to 5) in the dark (gray) and under illumination (orange) at −0.9 V vs. RHE. 
Based on the above LSVs, the effects of light irradiation on the yields of the products were also investigated. The potentials were firstly optimized by measuring the yields at different potentials under illumination, and −0.9 V vs. RHE was determined to be the best potential for the highest yield of CO (Fig. S13†). At this potential, the production rates of CO and H2 over ZIF-8@Co/C-x (x = 1 to 5) were detected under dark and light irradiation conditions. The production rate of CO (Fig. 4c) declines with increasing Co/C thickness, while that of H2 (Fig. 4d) rises; this trend is similar to that of the electrocatalysis on GCE (Fig. S9†). Additionally, the amount of H2 generated by Co/C on carbon paper (CP) was 4.4 times that of ZIF-8, while the amount of CO generated by ZIF-8 was 5.1 times that of Co/C (Fig. S14†) at −0.9 V vs. RHE; this further indicates that the generation of CO still mainly occurs on the core ZIF-8 while that of H2 occurs on the shell, and light irradiation does not change the catalytic center. In comparison with that in the dark, the yield of syngas on ZIF-8@Co/C-x (x = 1 to 5) at −0.9 V vs. RHE is enhanced by 3.8-5.2 fold under light irradiation (Table S5†). The improvement of ZIF-8@Co/C-4 in the amount of syngas exceeds those of the other four samples, and the yields of CO and H2 reach 17 and 926 mmol g−1 h−1, respectively, under light irradiation. The achievement of similar yields in the dark requires a potential of −1.1 V vs. RHE (Fig. 4b). That is to say, by using light irradiation, the overpotential to reach similar yield values can be reduced by 200 mV. The decreased overpotential further verifies that the cascaded light-irradiation process plays a role as a pre-activator to promote the catalytic reactivity. Moreover, the largely increased yield indicates that it is possible to improve the electric energy efficiency (EE) of the electrochemical process. According to the calculation formula (ESI†) of EE, an EE of 51.0% was obtained for ZIF-8@Co/C-4 by light irradiation, which increased by ∼30% compared with that in the dark (39.0%).
The solar energy utilization efficiency in this system was evaluated from the conversion efficiency of joules of sunlight (in) to joules of utilizable fuel (out), which is often employed in photocatalysis or photoelectrochemistry.39,40 The solar-to-syngas (joules to joules) energy conversion efficiency of ZIF-8@Co/C-x (x = 1 to 5) was calculated as follows:39  
In the equation, n1 is the moles of CO and H2 in the light-irradiation-cascaded electrochemistry, while n2 is the moles of CO and H2 in the electrochemistry. Psolar is the input power of the xenon lamp (450 mW cm−2 for a 0.25 cm2 illuminated area). ΔcH0 is the standard heat of combustion of H2 and CO (298.15 K).
The efficiency over ZIF-8@Co/C-x (x = 1 to 5) is presented in Table S5.† It was found that the maximal conversion efficiency is 5.38% over ZIF-8@Co/C-4, which exceeds those of reported photoelectrochemical systems (Table S6†). At this time, the syngas ratio (H2/CO) is 54/1 > 50; this can be employed in power generation, including gas turbines and fuel cells as well as refinery hydrotreating.38 ZIF-8@Co/C-4 was taken as a representation of ZIF-8@Co/C-x to study the photostability (Fig. S15a†). Negligible degradation of the current density and a stable molar ratio of H2/CO were observed on the ZIF-8@Co/C-4 catalyst after a continuous test for 8 h at an applied potential of −0.9 V vs. RHE (the analysis of gaseous products by GC every 2 h), suggesting that the as-prepared ZIF-8@Co/C shows durability for electrochemical reduction of CO2 by light irradiation. To further prove the chemical stability of the catalyst, the XRD of ZIF-8@Co/C-4 was tested after a reaction for 8 h (Fig. S15b†). The main peaks of XRD after reaction for 8 h are similar to that before the reaction, revealing the robust chemical stability of ZIF-8@Co/C-4 during the catalysis. After catalytic reaction for 8 h, the XPS of Co 2p (Fig. S15c†) shows Co0 and Co–O species in the Co/C shell, which is consistent with Co before the reaction and also proves the excellent chemical stability of the catalyst.
Reproducibility of the catalyst is a key element in the electrochemical reduction of CO2. Thus, taking the optimal sample ZIF-8@Co/C-4 as an example, catalytic experiments with six batches of the same catalyst were carried out to study the reproducibility under illumination, and the yields of the products (CO and H2) in each batch were determined by gas chromatography. As shown in Fig. S16,† the yields of CO and H2 are almost identical. Also, the relative standard deviations (RSDs) were calculated to be 4.9% for CO and 2.0% for H2 from Fig. S16,† suggesting that the catalyst in this system shows favorable reproducibility for CO2 electrochemical reduction.
To further investigate the effect of external factors41 including optical wavelength, light density and pH of electrolyte solution on the reactivity, the yield of products over ZIF-8@Co/C-4 was examined at −0.9 V vs. RHE. Compared with high-energy light exposure (with an AM1.5 filter), the production rates of CO and H2 decrease under visible-light illumination (with a 420 nm cutoff filter); this can be attributed to a component in ZIF-8@Co/C-4 with a wide bandgap, which leads to limited excitation by visible light. The yields of CO and H2 on ZIF-8@Co/C-4 remained 3.2 mmol g−1 h−1 and 343.5 mmol g−1 h−1 under visible-light illumination (Fig. S17a†), respectively, indicating that ZIF-8@Co/C-4 can maintain satisfying catalytic effects under visible light. This is a favorable indication to use sunlight, as visible light accounts for ∼50% of sunlight.42 When light density is reduced from 450 to 225 mW cm−1 (Fig. S17b†), the yield of CO and H2 are halved, which indicates that there are no photo-induced side-products in the reaction process. It was found that in neutral electrolyte solution (pH 7.12, Fig. S17c†), this system is still highly active; however, relative to the weak acid solution (pH 4.65), the yields of CO and H2 decrease by 36% (10.7 mmol g−1 h−1) and 57% (398.2 mmol g−1 h−1), respectively. This result may be due to the decreased amount of H+ in the neutral electrolyte solution. The high yield in the neutral electrolyte solution reflects that ZIF-8@Co/C-4 can be applied to electrochemical reduction of CO2 under a wide range of conditions.
Photo-activated electrocatalytic reduction mechanism
To reveal the reason behind the high reactivity, in situ transient photovoltage (TPV) tests using different materials as electrodes after adding CO2 or N2 were performed. Using bare ZIF-8 as an electrode (Fig. 5a), compared with the TPV signal in N2 atmosphere (black curve), the intensity of the signal in CO2 atmosphere (red curve) decreases by 61% together with severe trailing, indicating that CO2 may interact with ZIF-8 via a multi-step or slow reaction. In contrast, upon replacing ZIF-8 with Co/C (Fig. 5c), no appreciable difference in the TPV signal was found under CO2 (red curve) and N2 (black curve) atmosphere. These results indicate that CO2 tends to interact with ZIF-8 rather than Co/C. With ZIF-8@Co/C as an electrode (Fig. 5b), the TPV curve in CO2 atmosphere (red curve) possesses similar slow decay to that of bare ZIF-8; however, the intensity undergoes 3-fold enhancement compared to that of ZIF-8 (red curve, Fig. 5a). These data show that under irradiation, the ZIF-8 core in the composite serves as the CO2 reductive centre, while the Co/C shell mainly plays the role of absorbing light and generates electrons to activate CO2 and H+. These inferences basically agree with the conclusions of the experiments. When comparing the TPV intensity of ZIF-8@Co/C in N2 atmosphere (black curve, Fig. 5b) with that of Co/C (black curve, Fig. 5c) under the same conditions, we observed 20% enhancement in ZIF-8@Co/C, indicating that the core–shell structure facilitates the e−/h+ charge on the surface of the core and shell. The TPV responses for Co/C are positive (red and black curves) (Fig. 5c), while for ZIF-8, they are negative (red and black curve) (Fig. 5a). This nature of opposite charges in the core and shell43,44 provides an attractive force for the directional flow of photogenerated electrons from Co/C to ZIF-8. This will not only facilitate photo-induced charge separation but will also accumulate electrons in the catalytic sites.

(d) Scheme of the photo-activated process of CO2 and H+ and the process of electron transmission in the catalyst under light irradiation. 
To comprehensively understand the role of photo-irradiation in the electrochemical reduction of CO2, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed to investigate the effects of light irradiation on the charge transfer resistance (Rct). Nyquist plots of ZIF-8@Co/C-x (x = 1 to 5) were tested in the dark (Fig. S18a†) and under light irradiation (Fig. S18b†). The results indicate that Rct of each catalyst is significantly reduced upon light stimulation; of particular importance is the Rct of ZIF-8@Co/C-4, which sharply decreases from 103 Ω (in the dark) to 39 Ω (under light irradiation). This decrease unambiguously illustrates the influence of irradiation on relieving the charge transfer resistance and enhancing the efficiency of photo-induced charge separation.
As demonstrated by the lowered onset potential and overpotential in the light-irradiation-cascaded electrocatalysis, the electrons that accumulate in ZIF-8 in an oriented fashion probably participate in the activation of CO2. Based on the above experimental results and speculative analysis, we conjectured the influence of light irradiation on CO2 reduction, as shown in Fig. 5d. With the assistance of illumination, photo-induced electrons are generated on the Co/C shell and can activate H+ to form H*, producing hydrogen with relative ease. Benefiting from the force from the opposite charges in the core and shell, these electrons also conveniently transfer to the ZIF-8 core and trigger the activation of CO2 adsorbed by the sp2 C atoms of ZIF-8.33,45 The above-mentioned process is called a photo-activated process and plays a key role in decreasing the energy barrier for CO2 reduction to prepare syngas.
Compared with traditional photo-electrocatalysts,46–48 this photo-activated electrocatalyst integrates a photo-collecting centre and the electrocatalytic site so that the electrons generated by light can directly participate in the electrocatalytic process rather than being converted into the driving voltage of the external circuit (as in traditional photoelectron-catalysts). This change greatly improves the efficiency of the photogenerated electron utilization, which may also be the fundamental reason for the high joule-to-joule conversion efficiency (5.38% at −0.9 V vs. RHE) of solar energy in our system.
4. Conclusion
In conclusion, we proposed a new photo-activated process cascaded electrocatalysis for efficient CO2 reduction and synthesized a photo-activated electrocatalyst, ZIF-8@Co/C, by partial pyrolysis of core–shell porous ZIF-8@ZIF-67. The core–shell and hierarchical porous structure of ZIF-8@Co/C endow it with excellent light adsorption and electroconductivity properties and provide an appealing platform for diffusion and adsorption of substrates and intermediates. By adjusting the thickness of the shell, syngas within a wide range of CO/H2 ratios from 3/1 to 1/5 was obtained via electrochemical CO2 reduction, and the FE was nearly 100% at −1.2 V vs. RHE in the absence of conductive agents. Motivated by light irradiation, the onset potential and overpotential decreased by 40 and 200 mV, respectively, accompanied with a 5.2-fold enhancement in syngas production at a bias potential of −0.9 V vs. RHE. This led to a 30% enhancement of the electric energy efficiency. More significantly, high solar-to-syngas (joule-to-joule) conversion efficiency was achieved of up to 5.38%, which exceeds the value of reported photoelectrochemical systems. The activity of this system could be maintained for more than 8 h. The experimental observations and in situ transient photovoltage tests illustrate that ZIF-8 is more likely to produce CO, while Co/C mainly generates H2 and acts as the main source of photo-induced electrons. Based on the opposite charges between the shell and core, the electrons transfer in an oriented fashion from Co/C to ZIF-8 and participate in CO2 activation, which leads to the lowered intrinsic overpotential for CO2 reduction. This work may open a new avenue to essentially reduce the overpotential of CO2 electroreduction by introducing inexpensive sunlight.
