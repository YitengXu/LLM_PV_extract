    , Accepted 10th April 2018First published on 12th April 2018AbstractTwo dopant-free hole transporting materials (HTMs) comprising a planar indacenodithiophene (IDT) core with different alkyl chains (either C4 or C6) and electron-rich methoxytriphenylamine (TPA) side arms were synthesized (namely IDTC4-TPA and IDTC6-TPA, respectively) and successfully employed in CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite solar cells. These HTMs can be obtained from relatively cheap starting materials by adopting a facile preparation procedure that does not use expensive and complicated purification techniques. In the crystal lattice, each of these molecules interacted with either the CH/π or CH/O hydrogen bonds. At the same time, the IDTC6 backbone enables a tight molecular arrangement based on π–π stacking interactions (3.399 Å); this causes the new material to have a higher hole mobility than the standard IDTC4-based HTM. Moreover, the photoluminescence quenching in a perovskite/HTM film structure was shown to be more effective at the perovskite/IDTC6-TPA interface than at the perovskite/IDTC4-TPA interface. Consequently, devices fabricated using IDTC6-TPA show superior photovoltaic properties (exhibiting an optimal performance of 15.43%) compared with IDTC4-TPA-containing devices.
Introduction
Inorganic–organic lead halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted significant attention owing to their advantages such as low fabrication costs, low weight, flexibility, and high performance.1–4 Significant progress has been made in the field of PSCs over the past few years, and the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs has been increased dramatically from an initial value of 3.8%5 to a certified value of 22.1% in 2016.6 Among the various reported device architectures, the high efficiencies have been generally been achieved in an n–i–p-type structure in which a perovskite layer was used as the light absorber on top of a SnO2 film (n-type selective contact and hole-transporting material (HTM)).7
In this perovskite solar cell configuration, an ideal HTM should have a highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level that is well-aligned with the valence band of the perovskites to maximize hole injection; it should also possess a high mobility to enable hole extraction while limiting recombination.8,9 Numerous molecules have been investigated as HTMs in PSCs. To date, the highest reported PCEs have been reached with molecules such as 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis-(N,N′-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-MeOTAD) and poly[bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine] (PTAA). However, these materials suffer from a low hole mobility and low conductivity in their pristine form because of their amorphous nature. Thus p-type dopants or additives such as lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide have been ubiquitously adopted to generate free carriers and to increase the materials’ conductivities to achieve higher photovoltaic efficiencies.10,11 However, the introduction of p-type dopants not only complicates the optimization process, but also induces additional production costs. Moreover, lithium salts are hygroscopic, which may accelerate the degradation of the PSC devices.10 Thus, several attempts have been made to develop a high-performing class of dopant-free HTMs by incorporating fluorene,12,13 dithienosilole,14 diketopyrrolopyrrole,15 triphenylamine,12,16,17 benzodithiophene,18 tetraphenylethene,19 bithiophene,20 indacenodithienothiophene,21 phenothiazine,22 and copper(II) phthalocyanine23 as good p-type units into the molecular-core structure. Recently, Park et al. have designed and synthesized fluorinated indolo[3,2-b]indole derivatives as crystalline HTM for PSCs. The fluorinated indolo[3,2-b]indole backbone enables a tight molecular arrangement via stacking caused by strong π–π interactions, leading to a higher hole mobility than that of the current HTM standard, spiro-MeOTAD.24 Chen et al. presented a new hole-transporting material consisting of a C3h-truxene-core with arylamine terminals and hexyl side-chains (Trux-OMeTAD). This planar, rigid, and fully conjugated molecule exhibits excellent hole mobility and its surface energy is suitable for the perovskite layer to be deposited on top of it. Perovskite solar cells fabricated with Trux-OMeTAD as the p-layer show a high PCE of 18.6% with minimal hysteresis.25 Visible, rigid coplanar structures of these materials are beneficial for π-electron delocalization and preventing rotational disorder, which reduces reorganization energy and enhances charge-carrier mobility.26
Indacenodithiophene (IDT) has attracted much interest for use as a backbone unit for the design of new conjugated materials for applications in optoelectronic devices.27,28 The coplanarity of the IDT units can enhance molecular interchain interactions and should allow for a higher hole mobility.29 Zhang et al. reported a compound based on IDT with an alkyl substituent that showed a high field effect hole mobility of up to 1 cm2 V−1 s−1.28 In our previous study,21 two new HTMs (IDT-TPA and IDTT-TPA) were synthesized. The extended conjugation in the backbone of IDTT-TPA resulted in stronger π–π interactions (3.321 Å) and a higher hole mobility when compared with that of IDT-TPA. However, the 4-hexylphenyl groups in IDT-TPA and IDTT-TPA were arranged slightly out of the plane of the IDT and IDTT core, which led to a large steric hindrance effect in molecular packing. Therefore, it is necessary to optimize this molecular structure to obtain better molecular packing upon aggregation from a concentrated solution.
The low cost of IDT and its derivatives, the rigid coplanar structures, and the capacity for molecular structural variation by introduction of alkyl groups or functional groups to the carbon atom or the outer benzene ring allows for tunable electronic properties, controllable solubility, and controllable molecular packing.30 In comparison with an IDT unit with aryl side chains, an IDT unit with alkyl side chains should possess a better solubility. Considering the good planarity of the IDT unit, good solubility, and the high hole mobility of the materials based on the IDT unit with alkyl substituents, and the promising photovoltaic properties of the HTMs, we synthesized two new derivatives of alkyl substituted indacenodithiophene (IDT) in this study and used them as dopant-free HTMs for perovskite solar cells. Here, we synthesized two IDT-based compounds, namely IDTC4-TPA and IDTC6-TPA (Fig. 1), with different alkyl side chains to tune the material's electronic properties, solubility, and molecular packing structure. The materials were found to possess good solubility in common organic solvents, and each of these molecules interacted with either CH/π or CH/O hydrogen bonds. The hexyl substituted IDTC6-TPA resulted in stronger π–π interactions (3.399 Å) and had a higher hole mobility of 4.26 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 compared with IDTC4-TPA (1.05 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1). A dopant-free, planar PSC containing IDTC6-TPA was fabricated; it exhibited a higher PCE, namely 15.43% compared with devices containing IDTC4-TPA.

Results and discussion
All materials were purchased from Sigma Aldrich, USA, and used as received. The HTMs (IDTC4-TPA and IDTC6-TPA) were synthesized using a one-step Stille coupling between brominated methoxytriphenylamine and IDTC4-2SnMe3 or IDTC6-2SnMe3 (ESI,† Scheme S1). The full synthesis and characterization procedures are given in the ESI.† The materials were characterized using 1H NMR and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (ESI,† Fig. S1–S4).
A thermal gravimetric analysis of IDTC4-TPA and IDTC6-TPA is shown in ESI,† Fig. S5, which shows that the decomposition temperatures (5% weight loss) IDTC4-TPA and IDTC6-TPA were 426 and 437 °C, respectively. Both materials exhibited excellent thermal stability.
Fig. S6 (ESI†) displays the ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra of IDTC4-TPA and IDTC6-TPA in the solution and film state. In the solution state, the π–π* transition of the absorption band was observed at 450 nm, whereas in the film state, the corresponding π–π* transition was found at 460 nm. The absorption spectra of both films were red shifted compared with their solution absorption spectra, which can be attributed to the solid-state intermolecular interactions caused by their coplanar backbones.31
To fully elucidate the molecular conformation and packing motif of IDTC4-TPA and IDTC6-TPA in the solid state, single-crystal X-ray crystallography was performed (Fig. 2, ESI,† Fig. S7 and Table S1). Single crystals were grown by naturally evaporating a saturated ethanol/dichloromethane solution at ambient temperature. Intensity data was collected on a Bruker D8 Venture diffractometer with a Photon100 CMOS detector in ω scan mode using MoKα radiation (λ = 0.71073 Å). The diffracted intensities were corrected for Lorentz polarization effects and empirical absorption corrections. The structures were solved by direct methods and refined using full-matrix least-squares procedures based on |F|2 (F: structure factors) in the anisotropic–isotropic approximation. The positions of the hydrogen atoms were calculated from the geometrical point of view and refined with the riding model. All calculations were performed using the SHELXL structure refinement program.32

As for the molecular conformation, both IDTC4-TPA and IDTC6-TPA crystallized in a triclinic system with P space group. Further crystallographic details are given in ESI,† Table S1. The bulky alkyl side chains interrupt the intramolecular charge transfer caused by the distortion of the conjugation of the backbone.33 The torsion angles between the IDT core and the adjacent phenyl rings in IDTC4-TPA and IDTC6-TPA were 18.09° and 18.77°, respectively. It can be seen that the different alkyl chain lengths affect the backbone planarity differently. More importantly, the molecular packing structures in IDTC4-TPA and IDTC6-TPA are mainly determined by several weak hydrogen bonds, as well as by the π–π stacking interactions. As can be observed in Fig. 2 and in ESI,† Fig. S7 that the π–π stacking in both compounds is not perfectly face-to-face, which results in weaker interactions with offset or slipped alignment of the atoms. Although, the shift distance IDTC6-TPA (3.45 Å) is smaller than that of IDTC4-TPA (4.44 Å), the distance between the parallel aromatic rings in IDTC6-TPA (3.29 Å) is bigger than that of IDTC4-TPA (2.95 Å). These differences in the observed stacking patterns probably originate from the different hydrogen bond interactions in the crystal structures of the two compounds. However, nonconventional hydrogen bond interactions can be observed in the crystal structure of IDTC4-TPA, including in the interactions between the second and the third C–H in the butyl peripheral chain and O2, as well as in the hydrogen bonding between aromatic C9–H and S1 (ESI,† Fig. S7). The presence of the dichloromethane molecule in the crystal structure of IDTC6-TPA (with its weak nonconventional hydrogen bond interactions with C36–H in the peripheral hexyl chain and aromatic C16, 17-H) may be the cause of the smaller shift distance observed in this compound. Additionally, weak nonconventional hydrogen bonding between the first C–H in the hexyl chain (C35) and O1 may also place the aromatic rings in IDTC6-TPA at distant positions relative to each other. The different positions that C–O⋯H can occupy is a key factor affecting the distortion between the IDT core and the neighbor phenyl ring, as well as affecting the stacking of the different molecules. The hexyl substituted coplanar structure of IDTC6-TPA was beneficial for effective π-stacking. The stacking distances with weak edge–edge overlap were determined to be 3.399 Å. This π–π stacking interaction of IDTC6-TPA can decrease the intermolecular transfer integral.34 We might thus expect efficient formation of hole-carrier transport channels in the film state.35
To gain a deeper insight into the charge transport properties of IDTC4-TPA, IDTC6-TPA, and spiro-MeOTAD we conducted space-charge-limited current (SCLC) measurements according to a method in the literature.36 As shown in ESI,† Fig. S8, the hole mobility of each material was determined by fitting the current density–voltage (J–V) curves to the reported equation; the evaluated hole mobility of IDTC6-TPA was 4.26 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is higher than that of IDTC4-TPA (1.05 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) and that of dopant-free spiro-MeOTAD (1.89 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1). The value obtained in this work for IDTC4-TPA is similar to the data previously reported in the literature.21 Obviously, IDTC6-TPA shows a higher mobility than IDTC4-TPA; this is attributed to the strong π–π interaction between the planar structures of the rigid coplanar core in IDTC6-TPA, as revealed in Fig. 2.
The photoluminescence (PL) quenching of the perovskite emission was examined to investigate the hole-accepting capabilities of the HTMs at the perovskite/HTM interface. In such measurements, efficient quenching of the steady-state PL and a reduction of the PL lifetime would indicate efficient charge extraction at the perovskite/HTM interface. From the PL spectra (Fig. 3a) it is evident that both HTMs significantly quench the perovskite emission signal, with IDTC6-TPA having a slightly better PL quenching efficiency compared with IDTC4-TPA. The time-resolved PL (TRPL) measurements were conducted with an excitation wavelength of 500 nm and the response was monitored across the entire spectral range of the emission (Fig. 3b). ESI,† Table S2 summarizes the fitting parameters from fits with the TRPL measurement data. The CH3NH3PbI3/IDTC6-TPA samples showed a decay time of 5.58 ns, whereas the CH3NH3PbI3/IDTC4-TPA samples showed a longer decay lifetime of 6.78 ns. This indicates that IDTC6-TPA has slightly better hole extraction capabilities than IDTC4-TPA.37

(b) Normalized time-resolved photoluminescence spectra of the glass/perovskite/HTMs samples. 
With respect to the electrochemical properties, the frontier molecular orbital levels were also experimentally determined in both the solution and thin film state using cyclic voltammetry and an ionization energy measurement system, respectively. The results are given in ESI,† Table S3 and shown in ESI,† Fig. S9 and S10. As can be seen in ESI,† Table S3, the cyclic voltammetry results are in agreement with the HOMO and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels obtained with the ionization energy measurement system. The HOMO levels of IDTC4-TPA and IDTC6-TPA were −5.12 and −5.13 eV, respectively. Their optical band gaps were found to be 2.46 and 2.46 eV, respectively, based on the edge of the absorption spectra; thus the LUMO energy levels were evaluated to be −2.66 and −2.67 eV, respectively. The HOMO levels of IDTC4-TPA and IDTC6-TPA were above that of CH3NH3PbI3 (−5.4 eV), which provides sufficient driving force for the injection of holes from CH3NH3PbI3 into the HTMs.38 As a reference, we also tested the HOMO levels of doped spiro-MeOTAD (−5.25 eV), pristine spiro-MeOTAD (−5.11 eV) with the ionization energy measurement system (ESI,† Fig. S10).
PSCs with IDTC4-TPA and IDTC6-TPA were fabricated and characterized using conventional n–i–p planar device architectures (FTO/SnO2/PCBM/CH3NH3PbI3/IDTC4-TPA or IDTC6-TPA/Au). Through our solvent engineering technique, we prepared a dense and flat perovskite absorbing layer, as shown in a cross-sectional SEM image of the whole device (Fig. 1c). The subsequently deposited HTM layer is clearly distinguishable from the perovskite layer and the Au electrode. Fig. 1b shows a schematic energy-level diagram for the whole device. As explained above, IDTC4-TPA and IDTC6-TPA have appropriate HOMO and LUMO levels to facilitate hole extraction and to block electron leakage with respect to the valence and conduction bands of the perovskite layer in the device.39
The photovoltaic performance was measured under AM 1.5, 100 mW cm−2 simulated light illumination. The statistics for the device characteristics of photovoltaic parameters, including the short circuit density (JSC), open circuit voltage (VOC), fill factor (FF), and PCE are presented in Fig. 4 and summarized in Table 1. Ten devices collected from the same batch were examined for each PSC, which demonstrates the good reproducibility of PSCs employing IDTC4-TPA and IDTC6-TPA as HTMs. The device based on IDTC6-TPA had a higher VOC (0.98 ± 0.03 V), larger JSC (21.08 ± 0.36 mA cm−2), and higher FF (69.84 ± 2.01%), yielding an enhanced PCE of 14.52 ± 0.74%. The slightly higher VOC using IDTC6-TPA can be attributed to its higher HOMO level compared with that of IDTC4-TPA, which means IDTC6-TPA enables devices to have a higher driving force for charge transfer from the perovskite to the HTM layer. The device that contained IDTC6-TPA exhibited a higher FF as well as JSC, resulting in a significantly increased PCE, which we attributed to the higher hole mobility of IDTC6-TPA.

The J–V characteristics obtained from the best cells for each device are shown in Fig. 5a. The corresponding photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1. The PSC that contained IDTC6-TPA had a PCE of 15.43%, a JSC of 21.36 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.00 V, and a FF of 72.45%. Using the same fabrication conditions, the cell that contained IDTC4-TPA achieved a lower PCE of 14.45%, a JSC of 21.05 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.98 V, and a FF of 70.01%. The lower JSC values obtained for devices based on IDTC4-TPA compared with IDTC6-TPA is in agreement with the incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra shown in Fig. 5b. A reference device that incorporated the commercially available HTM spiro-MeOTAD doped with lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide was fabricated with the same structure. This device exhibited a PCE of 17.35%, which was slightly higher than that of the device containing IDTC6-TPA. The lower JSC values obtained for devices based on IDTC4-TPA and IDTC6-TPA compared with doped spiro-MeOTAD is in agreement with the IPCE spectra shown Fig. 5b. The device that contained doped spiro-MeOTAD exhibited a higher VOC than IDTC4-TPA and IDTC6-TPA, which is commensurate with its lower HOMO level. From the PL spectra (Fig. 3a), it is evident that all HTMs significantly quench the perovskite emission signal, with HTM of doped spiro-MeOTAD having a slightly better PL quenching efficiency compared with IDTC4-TPA and IDTC6-TPA. From the time-resolved PL measurements (Fig. 3b), the CH3NH3PbI3/spiro-MeOTAD (doped) samples showed a decay time of 3.81 ns, whereas the CH3NH3PbI3/IDTC4-TPA and CH3NH3PbI3/IDTC6-TPA samples showed a longer decay lifetime of 6.78 ns and 5.58 ns, respectively. This indicates that doped spiro-MeOTAD has a better hole extraction ability than IDTC4-TPA and IDTC6-TPA. The enhanced hole extraction should be due to well-matched energy levels between the valence bands of doped spiro-MeOTAD (HOMO = −5.25 eV) and CH3NH3PbI3 (HOMO = −5.4 eV)40 However, when the dopant was not included, the PCE dropped to 7.39% because of the low FF (37.71%), which can be explained by the low hole mobility and conductivity of spiro-MeOTAD. In the absence of hole-transporting layer (HTL), the devices generated a PCE of only 5.57% owing to significant lowering of the JSC (16.67 mA cm−2) and VOC (0.90 V) compared to the devices with HTL. The IPCE spectra of the different devices were measured to obtain further insight into the effects of the HTMs on the device performance (Fig. 5b). The IPCE results were consistent with the electrical characteristics of each device. The devices that contained IDTC4-TPA and IDTC6-TPA exhibited an enhanced IPCE over the whole visible wavelength range from 300 to 800 nm. The integrated current densities for IDTC4-TPA (20.01 mA cm−2), IDTC6-TPA (20.51 mA cm−2), and spiro-MeOTAD with dopant (21.89 mA cm−2) were consistent with the J–V measurements. To determine reliability of the devices, the stabilized efficiency was measured at a constant bias near the maximum power point. Both devices exhibited highly stable steady-state photovoltaic performances, with a steady PCE of 13.83% at a bias of 0.76 V for the device containing IDTC4-TPA and a PCE of 14.88% at a bias of 0.80 V for the device containing IDTC6-TPA (Fig. 5c and d). This is close to the average PCE values of the devices.

(b) IPCE spectra of the best devices that incorporated IDTC4-TPA, IDTC6-TPA, and doped spiro-MeOTAD as HTMs. Panels (c) and (d) show the steady-state efficiencies of perovskite solar cells using IDTC4-TPA or IDTC6-TPA HTM, respectively, measured at a constant bias voltage near the maximum power point. 
To investigate the long-term stability of the devices using these HTMs we compared the devices with the different HTMs that were stored outside the dry box for a week. They were thus exposed to room lighting and a fluctuating relative humidity (from 65 to 100%). As seen in ESI,† Fig. S11, the PCEs of PSCs with spiro-MeOTAD as the HTM retained only 70% of their initial efficiency. However, the IDTC4-TPA and IDTC6-TPA-based devices exhibited a PCE retention of 92 and 94%, respectively. This result clearly demonstrates the excellent device stability of IDTC4-TPA and IDTC6-TPA HTMs in PSCs. As reported by many research groups, the stability of PSCs depends strongly on the hydrophobicity of the HTM.41 The IDTC4-TPA and IDTC6-TPA films (ESI,† Fig. S12) showed a greater water contact angle of 103.3° and 104.7°, respectively, than spiro-MeOTAD films (61.3°); their high hydrophobicity effectively prevents moisture penetration into the perovskite layer. Further, IDTC6-TPA has a sufficient amount of alkyl chains to be solution processable. Additionally, these alkyl chains improve hydrophobicity, which in turn improves the stability of the resulting PSCs.
Conclusions
Two facile dopant-free HTMs (IDTC4-TPA and IDTC6-TPA) were designed and prepared from commercially available and inexpensive precursors in high yields using a simple one-step synthesis procedure. It was revealed through single-crystal analyses that both these molecules interacted with CH/π or CH/O hydrogen bonds. Moreover, the IDTC6 backbone enables a tight molecular arrangement via π–π stacking interactions (3.399 Å). Thus, IDTC6-TPA (in the film state) showed a higher mobility than IDTC4-TPA. A PCE of 15.43% was achieved from a PSC that incorporated dopant-free IDTC6-TPA as the HTM. The rigid coplanar structures and the capacity for molecular structural variation via the introduction of alkyl groups at the carbon atom allows for the electronic properties, solubility, and molecular packing to be tuned as well as yielding an excellent hole mobility and appropriate energy levels to make IDTC6-TPA a promising alternative to spiro-MeOTAD for the large-scale production of high-performance and stable perovskite solar cells.
