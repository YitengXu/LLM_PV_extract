    , Accepted 7th March 2019First published on 8th March 2019AbstractRechargeable aqueous sodium-ion batteries have become promising candidates for electrochemical grid-scale energy storage systems because of the rich natural abundance of sodium and the favourable safety of aqueous electrolytes. However, the electrochemical stability window of water limits the selection of electrode materials, and the poor performance of electrode materials hinders the comprehensive performance of the full batteries. In this work, a novel cost-effective and eco-friendly aqueous sodium–manganese hybrid battery system using a graphite felt cathode, activated carbon anode, and hybrid electrolyte (1 M Na2SO4 + 1 M MnSO4 + 0.1 M H2SO4) is proposed. The battery exhibits a discharge voltage of 1.2 V, a high coulombic efficiency (∼99.2%) and a lifetime of more than 7000 cycles. The hybrid system displays long cycling stability and high rate capability, demonstrating its feasibility for energy storage. It also provides a reference for the design of a new battery system that can be applied to develop high-performance aqueous sodium ion batteries for large-scale energy storage.
Introduction
Developing large-scale energy storage is of great importance for utilizing intermittent renewable energy, such as wind energy, and solar energy, because of their significant impact on the power grid.1,2 Rechargeable lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have high energy/power density and a long life span, and have been commercialized since 1991. However, the low abundance and high cost of lithium (Li) limit the application of LIBs in large-scale energy storage systems.3–5 In this respect, rechargeable sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have become promising alternatives because of the rich abundance and low cost of sodium (Na) metal and Na salts.6,7 In addition, Na is in the same main group as Li in the periodic table, and thus exhibits similar physical and chemical properties.8,9 However, traditional rechargeable SIBs still suffer from their use of a highly flammable organic electrolyte, and not fitting into large-scale energy storage systems, which require low cost and good safety. Aqueous rechargeable SIBs (ASIBs) have gained increasing attention because they are inherently safe, environmentally benign and use higher ionic conductivity aqueous electrolytes.2,10,11 The common cathodes of ASIBs, such as Prussian blue-type materials, sodium super ionic conductor (NASICON)-type materials, manganese (Mn)-based materials, and vanadium-based materials generally undergo a Na+ insertion/extraction reaction during the discharge/charge processes.12–14 Mn-based materials, Na0.44MnO2,15 Na0.35MnO216 and NaMnO217 have been reported previously, but they all suffer from poor capacity and low voltage. Recently, Liu et al. introduced layered K0.27MnO2 microflowers,18 and the full cell delivered a reversible capacity of 68.5 mA h g−1 (at 0.2 A g−1) when coupled with a sodium titanium phosphate [NaTi2(PO4)3] anode. Although the discharge voltage and capacity were somewhat higher, only 100 cycles were achieved, which still has room for improvement. Therefore, the application of Na-intercalation Mn-based cathodes is restricted by sluggish kinetics, low discharge voltage and poor capacity. Furthermore, the electrochemical window of water is only 1.23 V and the selections of anodes are limited [dominated by NaTi2(PO4)3].19,20 The cycling stability and energy density of ASIBs during existing energy storage technologies are still far from satisfactory. Thus, developing a new battery system may be an effective strategy to assist in solving these issues.
Unlike intercalation-type reactions, conversion-type reactions have the advantages of high voltage, high capacity and fast kinetics, and it can be considered as a way of improving the disadvantages of Mn-based materials based on Na-intercalation. Very recently, Chen et al. reported a rechargeable manganese–hydrogen battery based on a reversible conversion reaction of manganese ions/manganese dioxide (Mn2+/MnO2) on the cathode, and conversion of hydrogen ions/hydrogen (H+/H2) on the anode, which resulted in a high voltage, capacity and long-term cycling.21 The fast conversion of Mn2+ to MnO2 at the cathode demonstrates its superior electrochemical performance over other Mn-based cathode materials based on Na+ insertion in ASIBs, verifying the possibility of using this type of reaction in ASIBs. Generally, for ASIBs, adopting activated carbon (AC) as the anode results in a hybrid capacitor battery that is simple in structure, easy to manufacture, and circumvents the predicament of the selection of an anode material. Liu et al. reported a system composed of an Na0.44MnO2 cathode, AC anode, and sodium sulfate (Na2SO4) electrolyte, which displayed a cycling stability of 4000 cycles at 500 mA g−1.22 AC is also an alternative for industrialization. The Aquion Energy Company mass-produced ASIBs using AC as an anode, realizing a long lifetime of over 5000 cycles (average coulombic efficiency 85%). Therefore, AC, reminiscent of a supercapacitor with fast adsorption/desorption kinetics, was used as an anode.
In this research, an aqueous Na–Mn hybrid battery (denoted as SMHB) with graphite felt (GF) cathode, AC anode and Na–Mn hybrid electrolyte was fabricated. The cathode is based on the reversible conversion reaction of Mn2+ to MnO2, and it was eventually confirmed that Mn2+ formed MnO1.75 (γ-MnO2 with oxygen vacancies), achieving a high theoretical capacity of 484 mA h g−1. The anode is based on the adsorption/desorption of Na+ onto/from AC to achieve an excellent cycling stability and large power density, because of its supercapacitor-like characteristics. This system integrates the merits of a battery and supercapacitor, and combines the respective advantages of the two types of electrode reactions, resulting in optimized electrochemical energy storage. A discharge voltage of 1.2 V, a high coulombic efficiency of approximately 100%, excellent rate capability of 200 mA cm−2 and a lifetime of more than 7000 cycles without capacity decay were obtained using this hybrid system. Finally, Na0.44MnO2 based on Na insertion/extraction was compared with this cathode reaction. The exchange current density and charge–discharge voltage fluctuation were tested, which indicated that the SMHB delivered fast kinetics with an exchange current density of 19.8 mA cm−2 at 0.1 V and a low overpotential of 0.069 V at 10 mA cm−2. This study shows the feasibility of using the Na–Mn hybrid battery, and will inspire the design of more new hybrid battery systems.
Results and discussion
As shown schematically in Fig. 1, the SMHB was constructed from cathode-less GF, an AC anode and a Na–Mn hybrid electrolyte. The hybrid electrolyte was composed of 1 M Na2SO4 and 1 M manganese sulfate (MnSO4) with 0.1 M sulfuric acid (H2SO4). Manganese and sodium salts were used for the cathode and anode reactions, respectively. The addition of H2SO4 enhanced the reversible dissolution of MnO2 in the electrolyte. The three-dimensional structure of the GFs was conducive to conduction of the ions and electrons. However, GFs are relatively hydrophobic, thus a hydrophilic treatment was used on the GFs to obtain better hydrophilicity as proved from the contact angle test (Fig. S1, ESI†). Good hydrophilic conductivity ensured rapid oxidation and reduction of the Mn ions on the electrode surface. On the anode side, the coulombic efficiency of the AC anode was first tested in the electrolytes with different concentrations of H2SO4 to determine the appropriate concentration (0.1 M) of H2SO4 to be used (Table S1, ESI†). A high concentration of H2SO4 was favourable for the cathode reaction, but it also made hydrogen evolution occur more easily on the anode. There were some corrosion issues in the electrolyte with a high concentration of H2SO4. When the battery was charging, the Mn2+ ions in the electrolyte oxidized into MnO2 which was deposited onto the GF cathode, while the Na+ ions were adsorbed onto the AC anode. During the discharge process of the cell, the opposite occurred, the as-deposited MnO2 dissolved back into the Mn2+ electrolyte and the Na+ ions desorbed from the anode. The characteristics of the reaction on the cathode and the adsorption/desorption reaction on the anode benefitted the fast kinetics of the battery.

In order to verify the reaction mechanism of the cathode, the changes before and after the reaction were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), in situ Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Fig. 2a shows the XRD patterns of cathode samples in a pristine state, charged state, and discharged state. The peak of the charged state cathode at a 2θ of 37° was indexed to the facet of (131) for γ-MnO2 (JCPDS no. 14-644) (Fig. S2, ESI†), which confirmed that Mn2+ was oxidized to MnO2 during the charging process. The peaks at 2θ of 26° and 43° corresponded to GF. The high graphitization made it have better electrical conductivity. The XRD pattern of the discharged state cathode was similar to that of the pristine state, proving that the MnO2 reversibly dissolved into the electrolyte in the form of Mn2+. Next, the coin cell was assembled to using in situ Raman spectroscopy measurements. From Fig. 2b, the MnO2-GF cathode evolution process under a charge potential of 1.5 V to a capacity of 1 mA h cm−2 and discharge to 0 V at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 can be observed. The peaks located at wavenumbers of 574 cm−1 and 642 cm−1 corresponded well to the characteristic peaks of γ-MnO2.23,24 The Raman band at 642 cm−1 can be viewed as the symmetric stretching vibration ν2 (Mn–O) of the MnO6 groups, it was assigned to the A1g symmetric mode in the C2h3 spectroscopic space group. The band located at 574 cm−1 is usually attributed to the ν3 (Mn–O) stretching vibration in the basal plane of the [MnO6] sheets.25,26 The two bands become more and more intensive in the charging process and vanished gradually in the discharging process, which further verified the MnO2 reversible deposition/dissolution reaction.

(b) In situ Raman spectrum of SMHB over a complete charge and discharge process under a charge potential of 1.5 V to a capacity of 1 mA h cm−2 and a discharge current density of 10 mA cm−2 to a potential of 0 V. (c) SEM and (d) TEM images of the cathode after the first charge at 1.5 V to 1 mA h cm−2. (e) SEM image of the cathode after the first discharge at 10 mA cm−2 to 0 V (the inset shows an enlarged view). 

Fig. 2c and d show the SEM and TEM images of MnO2-GF at the charged state. The GF was covered by a uniform layer of MnO2 completely after charging, with a particle size distributed from tens to hundreds of nanometers (Fig. 2d). Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) element mapping showed that C, Mn, and O were distributed homogeneously in the MnO2-GF (Fig. S3e, ESI†). The morphology facilitated the dissolution of MnO2. The high-resolution TEM showed lattice fringes of 0.24 nm, which corresponded to the (131) plane of the γ-MnO2 (Fig. 2d). This result was consistent with that of the XRD patterns. When discharging to 0 V at 10 mA cm−2, the GF recovered to a surface which was nearly as clean as the pristine state with almost no MnO2 residue, which indicated that the MnO2 dissolved thoroughly in the electrolyte (Fig. 2e, S3a and S3f, ESI†). All the characterizations described previously confirmed the mechanism of the MnO2 deposition/dissolution.
To further verify the mechanism of the positive reaction, an electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance (EQCM) was used in conjunction with chronopotentiometry to obtain the formula weight of the oxidation products (MnOx). The typical results of the EQCM are presented in Fig. 3a. In this experiment, chronopotentiometry accompanied by the changes in the resonance frequency of the quartz crystal (QC) because of the electrochemical process was measured. The frequency changes of the QC were translated to changes in the mass of working electrode as a function of electric quantity (see Fig. 3a). The mass change (Δm) of the active material that was attached to the QC surface should follow the Sauerbrey equation:  where, Δf, f02, A, ρQ, μQ represent frequency change, resonant frequency of the QC, piezoelectrically active crystal area (0.2 cm2), density of quartz (2.648 g cm−3), and shear modulus of quartz (2.947 × 1011 g cm−1 s−2), respectively. The x value of MnOx was found to be 1.75 from the slope k (Δm/dq) and Faraday constant F (96485 C mol−1).27,28

It is worth noting that the valence state of Mn in the charging product was 3.5. Then high-resolution XPS was used after charging to 1 mA h cm−2, to determine more in-depth information of the chemical valence states for the Mn, and O elements. Fig. 3b and c show the XPS spectrum of Mn 3s and O 1s, respectively. The average oxidation state (AOS) of Mn was calculated to be 3.5, which was consistent with the results obtained from the EQCM. The calculation was based on the formula: AOS = 8.956 − 1.126ΔEs, where ΔEs is the binding energy difference between the doublet Mn 3s peaks.29,30 The O 1s spectrum can be divided into three components by performing a peak-fitting deconvolution: the peak at 529.6 eV was assigned to the Mn–O–Mn bond for tetravalent MnO2, at 531 eV the Mn–OH bond for trivalent MnOOH and at 532.2 eV to the H–O–H bond from the residual water of the materials, respectively.31,32 Therefore, the three peaks at 529.6, 531 and 532.2 eV were attributed to the lattice oxygen species (Olatt), surface adsorbed oxygen ions (Oads) and adsorbed molecular water (OH2O), respectively.24
The γ-MnO2 was obtained as a result of the random intergrowth of pyrolusite (1 × 1) and ramsdellite (2 × 1) tunnels.33 Therefore, γ-MnO2 is a highly disordered structure, which was also proved by XRD results with broadened and weakened diffraction peaks (Fig. S2, ESI†). Whereas, the oxygen vacancies can enhance the interaction between the MnO2 surfaces and oxygen-containing species.34 Thus, the γ-MnO2 phase could lead to a mass of point defects and vacancies. Given that the Oads originated from the oxygen vacancies, which were generated to maintain the electrostatic balance, the content of Mn(III) increased accordingly in γ-MnO2.35 Thus, the equation of the positive side is: Mn2+ + 1.75H2O ↔ MnO1.75 + 3.5H+ + 1.5e−. The Mn 3s and O 1s XPS of the cathode at the discharged state showed that the MnO1.75 disappeared completely (Fig. S4, ESI†), meaning that MnO1.75 converted entirely into soluble Mn2+.
Electrochemical performances of the MnO1.75-GF//AC full battery were investigated using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge/discharge measurements with a three-electrode system. Fig. 4a shows the CV curves of the AC anode and GF cathode (MnO1.75-GF) at 10 mV s−1 with a voltage range of −0.55–0.3 V and 0.3–1.1 V versus silver/silver chloride (Ag/AgCl), respectively. From the cathode CV curve, there is no anodic peak and the cathodic peak is located at ∼0.88 V. The anodic current increased with the potential, where Mn2+ was oxidized into MnO1.75. The anodic current always showed an increase with no decrease observed, because the GF has a large specific surface area, which can sufficiently come into contact with an infinite number of reactant Mn2+ ions in the electrolyte. Thus, the oxidation reaction proceeds continuously. The anode CV curve indicates the capacitance behaviour of AC. The charge–discharge performance of the full battery was studied. A chronoamperometric technique was applied with an optimal potential of 1.5 V to charge the battery and then discharged at 10 mA cm−2 to 0 V galvanostatically. As shown in Fig. 4b, to better understand the absolute voltages of the cathode and anode and whether the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions occur when the full battery works, an Ag/AgCl reference electrode was introduced to observe the voltages of the cathode and anode versus Ag/AgCl. Because of constant voltage charging, the anode voltage dropped to −0.5 V, over a hydrogen evolution potential of −0.6 V measured using CV (Fig. S5, ESI†), fortunately avoiding the hydrogen evolution reaction. The cathode voltage was found to be ∼1.0 V without oxygen evolution, from the CV curve of Fig. 4a. The electrolyte window without Mn2+ ions was explored to avoid the shielding of the hydrogen evolution process by the oxidation of Mn ions. The electrochemical window of the electrolyte of 1 M Na2SO4 with 0.1 M H2SO4 was 2.2 V (Fig. S6, ESI†). The potential of the oxygen evolution reaction was 1.6 V, which was much higher than the charge voltage of the cathode. The discharge curve appeared as a sloping line, due to the capacitance behaviour of the AC anode, and it showed that the discharge voltage of the battery was about 1.2 V, which can be seen more easily from Fig. S7b (ESI†). To investigate the effect of different concentrations of H2SO4 on the cathode reaction, the electrochemical performances of the full batteries in the 1 M Na2SO4, 1 M MnSO4 electrolytes with 0.05 M, 0.1 M and 0.5 M H2SO4 were tested. The discharge curves of the full battery at the 1st, 50th, 100th cycle added weight to the selection of 0.1 M H2SO4, which showed the best discharge voltage and cycling stability (Fig. S7, ESI†). The energy efficiency of the battery was calculated to be 60.1%.

(b) Discharge voltage curves of MnO1.75-GF//AC full cell, cathode, and anode monitored with the full battery charged at 1.5 V to 1 mA h cm−2 and discharged to 0 V at 10 mA cm−2. (c) Long-term stability test, (d) rate capability under different discharging current densities, and (e) charge-storage property test with different capacities charged to a full battery. 
It is worth noting that the battery showed no noticeable capacity decay over 7000 cycles at a charge capacity of 1 mA h cm−2 with a coulombic efficiency of nearly 100%, because of the long-term cycling stability (Fig. 4c). Whereas, the full battery in the electrolyte with 0.05 M H2SO4 exhibited a lower coulombic efficiency of ∼93.9% with poor stability (Fig. S8, ESI†). Fig. 4d displays the galvanostatic discharge curves of the MnO1.75-GF//AC battery at various current densities from 10 mA cm−2 to 200 mA cm−2, showing a slight decrease in the discharge capacities. When the current density returned back to 10 mA cm−2, the capacity also returned to the initial capacity. The SMHB has a high rate capability and power density because of the capacitance behaviour of the AC (Fig. S9, ESI†) and 1.75 electrons conversion reaction. In addition, the charge storage properties with different charging capacities were tested (Fig. 4e). The coulombic efficiency showed almost no decay with capacity charging from 1 mA h to 5 mA h, exhibiting a good adjustable capacity-storage capability. The battery was proven to be suitable for further use, due to its long cycling life, adjustable capacity, and high rate performance. A button cell was assembled with a GF cathode, filter paper separator, and AC anode (Fig. S10, ESI†). The theoretical gravimetric energy density (based on the mass of 1 cm2 GF) of the battery system was calculated to be 70.8 W h kg−1, showing potential for future large-scale applications. The gravimetric energy density achieved was 50.8 W h kg−1.
Commercial Na0.44MnO2 was also chosen as a contrast to verify the excellent electrochemical properties of the GF-MnO2 cathode based on the conversion reaction. It is well known that Na0.44MnO2 is widely used in aqueous SIBs. In contrast, Na0.44MnO2 (Fig. S11 and S12, ESI†) was synthesised and assembled into a Na0.44MnO2//AC full battery constructed from an Na0.44MnO2 cathode, AC anode, and 1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte to highlight the excellent performance of the SMHB. The Na0.44MnO2//AC full battery was also tested using a three-electrode system and the voltage variation of the full cell, cathode and anode was monitored with charging at 1.5 V to 1 mA h cm−2 and discharging at 10 mA cm−2 to 0 V (Fig. 5a). The noticeable capacity decay of the Na0.44MnO2//AC full battery can be observed from Fig. 5b, revealing the rather poor cycling stability. The discharge curves of the MnO1.75-GF//AC battery and the Na0.44MnO2//AC battery are compared in Fig. 5c. The discharge voltage of SMHB is 0.63 V higher than that of the Na0.44MnO2//AC battery.

(d) Exchange current density measurement of MnO1.75-GF//MnO1.75-GF and Na0.44MnO2//Na0.44MnO2 symmetric batteries at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 in the voltage range of −0.1 to 0.1 V. (e) Voltage fluctuation comparison of discharge curves of MnO1.75-GF//AC and Na0.44MnO2//AC full cell at different current densities. All tests were performed by three-electrode test system. 
Subsequently, Na0.44MnO2//Na0.44MnO2 (denoted as Battery I) and MnO1.75//MnO1.75 (denoted as Battery II) symmetrical batteries were assembled. Exchange current density tests were performed on the two batteries (Fig. 5d). The potentials of the CV tests were determined in the range of −0.1–0.1 V. The current density of Battery II (19.8 mA cm−2) was stronger than that of Battery I (14.0 mA cm−2). Fig. 5e displays the voltage fluctuation comparison of the discharge curves of the two batteries at different current densities. The overpotential of Battery II was much lower, showing that the output voltage was stable at different current densities because of its fast kinetics. The previously described comparison experiments were based on the same deposition capacity (1 mA h cm−2) of the Na0.44MnO2//AC battery and the MnO1.75-GF//AC battery, so the mass loading of the Na0.44MnO2 active material was ∼22 mg, which may be one of the factors that affected the performance of Na0.44MnO2. To make the comparison more reasonable, an experiment was also designed, in which MnO1.75 was deposited to 10.6 mA h (i.e., 22 mg, comparable mass loading with Na0.44MnO2) on GF with a charging voltage of 1.5 V and was discharged to 0 V at 10 mA cm−2. From Fig. S13 (ESI†), the MnO1.75-GF//AC battery still showed better cycling stability and coulombic efficiency. Finally, some Mn-based materials reported previously are summarized in a list for comparison with the SMHB (Table S2, ESI†). In all the full batteries, the SMHB exhibited high-level performances for voltage, capacity, cycling stability and so on, which will advance the development of Mn-based battery systems. All of the previously mentioned results indicate that the SMHB has the potential to be an alternative for use in large-scale energy storage applications.
Conclusions
A rechargeable aqueous sodium–manganese hybrid battery (SMHB) was constructed from a graphite felt cathode, activated carbon anode and a hybrid electrolyte. The mechanism whereby MnO1.75 is generated by Mn2+ in a positive reaction has been verified. The SMHB exhibits a high voltage of 1.2 V, an excellent high rate capability of 200 mA cm−2, an ultrastability of over 7000 cycles and a low overpotential. The SMHB is a very promising system, possessing the benefits of consistent safety, low cost, and attractive energy density and power density with cycling stability for a sustainable energy storage solution for use in large-scale applications. This research can be extended to develop high-performance aqueous sodium ion batteries.
