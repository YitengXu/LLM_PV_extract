    , Accepted 9th May 2016First published on 10th May 2016AbstractSemi-transparent perovskite solar cells have significant potential as the top cell in a tandem structure with silicon (Si) or copper indium gallium selenide (CIGS) as the bottom cell. The efficiency of such tandem cells depends on careful light management and optical design of the device. Here, using the transfer matrix method, we report a detailed optical analysis of the absorption distribution, parasitic absorption and reflection losses in various semi-transparent perovskite solar cell structures and their impact on tandem cell efficiencies. The optical properties of some key layers of a semi perovskite cell are measured and modelled to facilitate the optical analysis. It is found that the encapsulation glass and the absorption in the transparent conductive electrode have a huge impact on the tandem efficiency. The tandem efficiency limit is also calculated to present the design of a two-terminal current-matched tandem device required to achieve 30% conversion efficiency. This work provides directions for further improving the power conversion efficiency of perovskite/Si tandem cells.
Semi-transparent perovskite solar cells with good transmittance and power conversion efficiency have been reported by several groups.1–4 With a bandgap of around 1.6 eV, semi-transparent perovskite solar cells are suitable for low cost and high efficiency solar tandem devices5–7 as the top cell on a Si or CIGS bottom cell.
Löper and co-workers demonstrated a four-terminal (4-T) perovskite/Si tandem stack with an absolute efficiency gain of 1.85%8 compared with a co-processed CH3NH3PbI3 single junction cell.9 These authors also performed an opto-electrical loss analysis based on several incrementally built-up layer stacks but without considering the interferences between adjacent layers. They highlighted that the parasitic absorption in fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) glass, spiro-OMeTAD and the indium tin oxide (ITO) transparent electrode in the near infrared (IR) region limited the tandem performance.8 McGehee's group demonstrated mechanically stacked tandem cell systems with a semi-transparent perovskite cell on top of a Si or a copper indium gallium (di)selenide (CIGS) cell. With a 12.7% efficient CH3NH3PbI3 cell as the top cell, the tandem efficiency reached 17% and 18.6% when using Si (11.4% efficient) or CIGS (17% efficient) as the bottom cell, respectively. They also conducted transmission measurements of the top semi-transparent perovskite cell, and reported transmission losses caused by the absorption in FTO, silver nanowire electrodes and spiro-OMeTAD of the semi-transparent cell.10 A monolithic perovskite/CZTSSe (copper zinc tin sulfur–selenium) tandem solar cell achieved a high open circuit voltage, close to the sum of each single reference cell.11 Mailoa et al. reported a 13.7% efficient two-terminal (2-T) perovskite/Si tandem cell using a n++ Si tunnel junction with low resistance and parasitic absorption.12 More recently, up to 21.2% efficiency was achieved for monolithic perovskite/silicon heterojunction tandem solar cells by Werner et al.13 A very high conversion efficiency of 28% was achieved using an optical splitting system to separate and direct light onto a perovskite cell and a mono-crystalline silicon heterojunction cell.14 Most recently, a novel design with a perovskite/bifacial Si heterojunction tandem cell was proposed with the potential to achieve 33% efficiency with careful optical characterisation providing current matching.15 Löper et al. studied the effect of Lambertian light trapping in the perovskite top cell, and investigated the limiting efficiency of ideal perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells.16 Lal et al.17 determined the optical properties of an idealised 4-T perovskite/Si device necessary to achieve 30% efficiency (negligible front reflection and high constant broadband transmission for transparent conductive electrodes), highlighting the importance of careful light management and optical design of the device. Filipic et al. conducted a systematic optical analysis, using wave optics and geometrical optics, of two general perovskite/Si tandem structures, and suggested over 30% efficiency with optimised layer thicknesses.18
The optical constants of CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite have been published by many groups,19–26 while there are limited literature studies reporting the optical analysis of perovskite based tandem cells systematically. We present a detailed analysis of multiple potential tandem configurations using the transfer matrix and Shockley–Queisser detailed balance methods. Our work differs from earlier approaches in that we analyse each component of the top perovskite cell optically and quantify the optical losses expected when the perovskite cell is stacked on a Si bottom cell in either a 4-terminal or a 2-terminal configuration. Our work seeks to study the potentials of various semitransparent perovskite device structures using transparent conductive electrodes (TCEs) previously demonstrated and proposed in terms of optical performances and hence their impact on final tandem conversion efficiencies.
Nine possible perovskite device structures shown in Fig. 1 were analysed. The first three structures, Fig. 1(a)–(c), are mechanically stacked 4-T tandem systems of the semi-transparent perovskite cell on Si. The semi-transparent perovskite cell is fabricated on a glass superstrate. In Fig. 1(a), a conventional TCE of indium tin oxide (ITO) is used. In Fig. 1(b) and (c) dielectric/metal/dielectric (DMD) consisting of the MoO3/thin Au/MoO3 stack and graphene are used as TCEs respectively which have been demonstrated to be possible TCE options in ref. 4 and 27. Fig. 1(d)–(i) are the 2-T monolithic configurations with the perovskite cell fabricated directly on a Si cell of appropriate polarity. The perovskite cells in Fig. 1(d)–(f) use the standard TiO2 and spiro-OMeTAD interfacial layers while the cells in Fig. 1(g)–(i) use inorganic NiO and ZnO hole and electron transport layers, allowing Si cells with standard polarity to be used as the bottom cell. Both NiO28 and ZnO29 have shown great potential as inorganic interfacial layers for perovskite solar cells due to their high bandgaps and potentially low absorption losses. In addition, ZnO can be processed at low temperatures suitable for subsequent fabrication of a perovskite layer. ITO (with MoO3 as a protective layer18) is used as TCE in Fig. 1(a), (d) and (g). The DMD stack is used in Fig. 1(b), (e) and (h). Graphene is analysed as an alternative potential TCE27 in Fig. 1(c), (f) and (i). These configurations from Fig. 1 are therefore referred to as 4-T ITO, 4-T DMD, 4-T graphene, 2-T ITO, 2-T DMD, 4-T graphene, inverted 2-T ITO, inverted 2-T DMD and inverted 2-T graphene based on the tandem cell structures and polarity of the perovskite top cell. For the 4-T configuration, the lamination proposed for the purpose of simulation will consist of 30 μm EVA and 30 nm SiO2 as a moisture barrier. For the 2-T tandems, optical losses in the encapsulation material (low iron soda-lime glass30 and a thin laminating layer with a refractive index of glass) are also included in the model.
 Fig. 1  Schematic diagrams (not-to-scale) of possible perovskite/Si tandem configurations and the corresponding energy level diagram of the perovskite top cell. The semi-transparent perovskite solar cell was (a–c) fabricated on FTO glass and mechanically stacked on a Si cell in a 4-T configuration; (d–f) fabricated on Si in a 2-T configuration using TiO2, and spiro-OMeTAD as the hole blocking and hole transport layers, respectively; (g–i) fabricated with inverted polarity on Si in a 2-T configuration using NiO and ZnO as the hole transport and hole blocking layers, respectively. Different TCEs were used including ITO, MoO3/thin Au/MoO3 stack and graphene. Hence they were labelled (a) 4-T ITO, (b) 4-T DMD, (c) 4-T graphene, (d) 2-T ITO, (e) 2-T DMD, (f) 4-T graphene, (g) inverted 2-T ITO, (h) inverted 2-T DMD and (i) inverted 2-T graphene. 
The corresponding energy level diagram of electron/hole transport, active and conductive layers in each perovskite top cell as well as carrier transport directions are illustrated next to each structure in Fig. 1, showing favourable band-alignment.
To construct the optical parameter database for some key layers in a semitransparent perovskite solar cell, separate samples were also prepared each with a single layer of TiO2, perovskite, spiro-OMeTAD, MoO3 or Au deposited on a plain glass substrate using the same conditions as would be used for a semi-transparent perovskite solar cell with a DMD stack as TCE. The cross-sectional scanning electron microscopic (SEM) image of such a cell is shown in Fig. 2. The details of the device fabrication process can be found in ref. 4 and the ESI.†

Variable angle spectroscopic ellipsometry and spectrophotometer measurements were carried out on these samples. The wavelength-dependent optical properties of each individual layer were modelled according to the Fresnel equations,31 taking into account the structural parameters such as the layer thickness, void fraction profile and surface roughness. The optical constants (refractive index n and extinction coefficient k) were determined using WVASE®.32 The optical properties of the alternative hole transport layers, hole blocking layers and TCEs used in Fig. 1(c) and (d) were taken from ref. 33–35.

Fig. 3 shows the experimental and modelled amplitude component ψ, phase difference Δ, refractive index n and extinction coefficient k of a CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite film on a flat glass substrate. The details of the measurement and optical model can be found in our previous work.24,25 Transmission data were not collected in this case because the rear surface of the glass substrate was sandblasted to eliminate backside reflections.36 The CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite film thickness was determined to be 278 nm with 34 nm surface roughness and 12% void. Perfect agreement between the experimental and simulated data for this test structure facilitates reliable simulation of the complete multilayer device structure. ψ, Δ, n and k results for the other layers in the perovskite cell are shown in the ESI.† See Fig. S1–S6 (ESI†) for the TEC-8 FTO glass substrate, a thin flat glass substrate, TiO2 on glass, spiro-OMeTAD on glass, MoO3 thin film on glass, and Au thin film on glass, respectively.

The ellipsometry data are collected from three incident angles of 65°, 70° and 75°. 

Fig. 4 shows the n and k values of perovskite (a and b), c-TiO2 (c), spiro-OMeTAD (d), MoO3 layer (e) and Au layer (f) determined in this work and compared to published data. The measured and modelled reflectance (R) and transmittance (T) of the complete perovskite solar cell structure (Fig. 2) are shown in Fig. 5. Reasonably good agreement was obtained between the measured and modelled data with the discrepancy attributable to the roughness of the FTO coated glass substrate (see Fig. S1, ESI†), which propagates throughout the whole structure, especially in the thin TiO2 layer which takes on the roughness of the FTO side of the glass substrate.

Table 1 shows the thicknesses of each layer in the semitransparent perovskite solar cell as determined by modelling using WVASE, which are comparable with the thicknesses shown in Fig. 2. The values of n(λ), k(λ) and thickness for each layer so determined were used to calculate the parasitic optical losses in the device. The total reflection, total transmission and absorption occurring within each layer of the device are plotted in stack diagrams in Fig. 6–14. The reflection and absorption curves were integrated with respect to the solar spectrum to determine the current density lost by reflection and parasitic absorption in each layer as well as the photo-generated current density in the perovskite and Si absorbers. These results are shown in the legends in Fig. 6–14. The sheet resistance of each TCE including the sheet resistance of chemical vapour deposition (CVD) grown and roll-to-roll transferred 4-layer-graphene is given in Table 2.

For the 4-T configurations, the largest loss is caused by absorption in FTO glass (around 22% by summing up the absorption in glass, SnO2, SiO2, and FTO) (see Fig. 6–8). The glass alone absorbs the majority of incident light below 350 nm while the rest of the FTO glass substrate absorbs light in the entire wavelength range concerned. It can be concluded that the widely used FTO glass is not a desirable candidate for the superstrate of perovskite solar cells. Alternative superstrates should be investigated for the conversion efficiency of a 4-T tandem cell to exceed 30% as the simulated efficiencies for 4-T ITO, 4-T DMD and 4T graphene configurations are 29.5%, 28.2% and 29.0%, respectively (see Table 3).
By reducing the glass thickness to 0.5 mm for the 4-T ITO configuration, currents in the perovskite cell and the Si cell will be increased by 0.7 mA cm−2 and 2.1 mA cm−2 respectively. The replacement of soda lime glass with boro-silicate glass will increase the currents in the perovskite cell and the Si cell by 0.8 mA cm−2 and 2.4 mA cm−2, respectively. The efficiencies will be boosted to 31.3% and 31.7% for the above two structures, respectively.
For the 2-T configurations, the largest loss is caused by total reflection. The reflection loss is more than 11% for 4-T tandem (see the red region in Fig. 6–8) and is more than 17% for 2-T tandem. There is a large reflection loss in 2-T for wavelengths above 1000 nm due to the large refractive index contract between encapsulation glass and underneath TCE layers as more light is reflected from the higher refractive index layers. The reflection loss is the worst when a DMD stack is used for the 2-T tandem as the reflective gold is closer to the illumination, compared to its position in the 4-T tandem. The reflection of light by Au in the 800–900 nm wavelength range significantly reduces incident light into Si and therefore photo-generated current by Si.
In terms of parasitic absorption in TCE, DMD performs the worst due to absorption in gold in the long wavelength range reducing incident light into the Si bottom cell. When DMD is used in the 2-T tandem, its absorption is very significant (>14%), particularly at short wavelengths, contributing to photo-generated current loss in the semi-transparent perovskite cell at wavelengths below 800 nm, as shown by yellow regions in Fig. 10 and 13. While graphene absorbs less short wavelength light than Au, its absorption of long wavelength light still causes current loss in the Si bottom cell.
The ITO electrode performs the best with a least amount of optical loss (0.7 mA cm−2 in 2-T), while the current losses caused by DMD and graphene electrodes are 6.7 mA cm−2 and 4.1 mA cm−2, respectively. In the 2-T tandem, absorption in spiro-OMeTAD (1.2 mA cm2) above the perovskite causing current loss is also observed. The attempt to replace spiro-OMeTAD with a high bandgap ZnO (3.37 eV) is evaluated in this work. The use of ZnO also allows an inverted perovskite structure, which replaces TiO2 with NiO, to accommodate a Si cell with standard polarity (n-doped surface on the illuminating side and p-doped surface on the rear). Fig. 13 shows that there is no optical gain in using ZnO as the parasitic absorption in the short wavelength is still significant to cause 1.8 mA cm−2 current loss in perovskite solar cells.
The advantage of 4-T tandem is the absence of current matching, while the disadvantage is the extra metal contacts. 2-T tandem may be a more elegant approach, by depositing the perovskite top cell directly on the Si bottom cell. The elimination of the need for FTO glass allowing the use of low-iron soda lime glass in the analyses in Fig. 9–11 results in lower parasitic optical losses resulting in higher current generated by the Si bottom cell. However in 2-T tandem, current matching remains a challenge as observed in Fig. 6–14.
One way to narrow the current mismatch is to reduce the thickness of the perovskite absorber. The photo-generated current densities and efficiencies were simulated for various perovskite layer thicknesses (Fig. 15). The optimized perovskite layer thickness was obtained at the point where JscPEROVSKITE equals JscSI. Stacking perovskite cells with optimised thicknesses on Si cells leads to tandem efficiencies of 31.4% for 2-T ITO, 24.4% for 2-T DMD, 29.6% for 2-T graphene, 31.8% for inverted 2-T ITO, 24.6% for inverted 2-T DMD, and 28.9% for inverted 2-T graphene configurations, respectively (Table 4). The use of a higher-bandgap hole blocking layer and textured Si wafer41,42 would further reduce optical losses in the perovskite cell and the Si cell, respectively. The textured Si surface is effective in anti-reflection and light trapping. Conformal coating of the perovskite cell on such a surface can be achieved by physical deposition and spray coating. Furthermore, the use of a perovskite material with a higher bandgap (in the vicinity of 1.7 eV43) maximising the JSC value for the top perovskite and the bottom Si cell will be essential in achieving a high tandem cell conversion efficiency.

Conclusions
The transfer matrix and Shockley–Queisser detailed balance methods were used to examine the optical losses of various possible perovskite/Si tandem structures. The parasitic losses in each layer of the top semi-transparent perovskite solar cell were analysed and quantified, providing information on the limitations of each structure under investigation and guidance for alternative structures suitable for perovskite/Si tandem. We found that the use of FTO glass is not suitable for 4-T configurations because of high absorption losses in the soda-lime glass and FTO layers. In addition, the use of a thin gold-dielectric stack as a transparent conductive electrode (TCE) results in high reflection and absorption losses. While graphene can be a potential candidate as a TCE, ITO performs best with the least reflection and absorption losses. The search for high band-gap alternative transport materials other than spiro-OMeTAD above the pervoskite layer will boost the current generated by the perovskite cell. This work highlights the importance of the choice of TCE and interfacial layers and their positions with respect to the incident light. The optimum perovskite layer thicknesses for the two terminal (2-T) configurations studied for current matching were determined. It is calculated that a conversion efficiency of up to 31.8% is achievable for a 2-T monolithic configuration using ITO as the transparent conductive electrode. The use of a thinner encapsulation glass, a textured Si cell and improved perovskite cell fabrication techniques that provide uniform deposition over a textured surface, plus the use of higher bandgap perovskite materials, is expected to provide further improvements in efficiency.
