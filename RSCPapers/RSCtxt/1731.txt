    , Accepted 7th March 2019First published on 7th March 2019AbstractOrganic–inorganic halide perovskite materials exhibit excellent memristive properties, such as a high on/off ratio and low switching voltage. However, most studies have focused on Pb-based perovskites. Here, we report on the resistive switching and neuromorphic computing properties of Pb-free perovskite-related MA3Sb2Br9 (MA = CH3NH3). The Ag/PMMA/MA3Sb2Br9/ITO devices show forming-free characteristics due to a self-formed conducting filament induced by metallic Sb present in the as-prepared MA3Sb2Br9 layer. An MA3Sb2Br9-based memristor exhibits a reliable on/off ratio (∼102), an endurance of 300 cycles, a retention time of ∼104 s and multilevel storage characteristics. Furthermore, synaptic characteristics, such as short-term potentiation, short-term depression and long-term potentiation, are revealed along with a low energy-consumption of 117.9 fJ μm−2, which indicates that MA3Sb2Br9 is a promising material for neuromorphic computing.
Introduction
The concept of neuromorphic computing was proposed to overcome the von Neumann bottleneck and to apply the information processing of human brains to artificial intelligence systems.1,2 Human brains composed of a high-density neural network can perform information processing in parallel, where short-term behavior for computation and long-term behavior for learning and memory are achieved in synapses with only fJ (femto Joule) level power consumption.3–6 Recently, memristor (memory + resistor) devices have been suggested as attractive candidates for neuromorphic computing because their nonvolatile property caused by resistance change and the MIM structure of the memristor is similar to the operational principle and structure of biological synapses.7–11 Several materials, such as metal oxides and organics, have been used as the insulator layer of a memristor for neuromorphic computing, but they showed much higher operating energy than human brains and suffered from undesirable side effects from the forming process.12–16 A forming process is required for the formation of a conducting filament during resistive switching, but the forming process can cause degradation of the materials and random resistance states.15,16 Therefore, developing forming-free and low-energy-consuming materials is valuable for memristor and neuromorphic computing.
Organic–inorganic halide perovskite materials have been in the spotlight as solar cell absorbers since reports on long-term-stable solid-state perovskite solar cells with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of about 10%,17,18 following two seminal pieces of research on perovskite-sensitized solar cells reported in 200919 and 2012.20 Over a short period of time, the PCE of perovskite solar cells was significantly improved and eventually reached 23.7%.21 Such a superb performance is related to their large absorption coefficient22 and micro-scale charge diffusion length.23–25 Apart from photovoltaic applicability, perovskite materials attracted attention for light emitting diodes,26 X-ray imaging27 and water splitting.28 On the other hand, several anomalous phenomena, such as dynamic motion of cations,29,30 ferroelectric behavior31 and ion migration,32 were unveiled, which are related to current–voltage (I–V) hysteresis.33,34 These phenomena are also adaptable for resistive switching memory and neuromorphic computing. Recently, perovskite-based memristors35,36 and neuromorphic computing37,38 have been intensively studied. Perovskite materials exhibited favorable characteristics for memory and computing, such as low power consumption, multilevel data storage and analog switching, which might be related to both inorganic and organic characteristics in organic–inorganic halide perovskite.39–43 The switching properties of perovskite were reported to be better than those of oxides and chalcogenides when used in flexible device applications,43 which is due to the structural flexibility of organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite.44 Moreover, perovskite could be a candidate for photonic memory and computing due to its superb light–matter interaction.22,27,45 Most studied perovskites have been based on Pb-based materials, which might be limited to semiconductor-related industrial applications. The group-VA cations (M3+ = Bi3+, Sb3+) can be good candidates for non-Pb-based memristor materials. Although Bi3+ or Sb3+ cations cannot be stabilized in a perovskite structure, the air stability and iso-electronic property of Bi3+ with Pb2+ are expected to be beneficial for optoelectronic properties.46–50 Bi3+ or Sb3+ based perovskite-like halides were thus applied to photovoltaics,50 photodetectors51 and memory applications.52
Here, we report the resistive switching and neuromorphic computing property of MA3Sb2Br9 (MA = CH3NH3, methylammonium). MA3Sb2Br9 is applied for the first time to neuromorphic computing in this study. MA3Sb2Br9 formed on ITO-coated glass substrate exhibits forming-free and bipolar switching characteristics, where the as-prepared MA3Sb2Br9 shows an already low resistance state (LRS) due to a self-formed conducting filament. Endurance, retention time and multilevel storage are characterized. Artificial synaptic characteristics, such as excitatory post synaptic current (EPSC), inhibitory postsynaptic current (IPSC), long-term potentiation (LTP), long-term depression (LTD) and spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), are also observed from MA3Sb2Br9, which are beneficial for neuromorphic computing with low energy consumption (117.9 fJ μm−2).
Results and discussion
For the switching study on MA3Sb2Br9, we fabricated a device with an Ag/PMMA/MA3Sb2Br9/ITO structure (Fig. 1a). An MA3Sb2Br9 crystal exhibits a trigonal structure composed of corner-shared SbBr63− octahedra, where MA cations occupy voids in the lattice at room temperature (Fig. 1b).51 The poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) layer is used to control the amount of reaction of MA3Sb2Br9 film with the top Ag electrode and exposure of the MA3Sb2Br9 film to oxygen and moisture under ambient conditions (Fig. S1†).40 A uniform MA3Sb2Br9 layer of about 200 nm thickness is confirmed from the cross-sectional SEM image (Fig. 1c). The X-ray diffraction pattern in Fig. 1d shows that the MA3Sb2Br9 layer can be indexed to trigonal symmetry with space group P3m1.51 The band gap is determined to be about 2.72 eV from the UV-vis spectrum, which shows good consistency with previous reports.51

Fig. 2a exhibits the initial I–V characteristic of MA3Sb2Br9 based memristors on a semilogarithmic scale at room temperature. The initial resistance is less than 102 Ω, which is indicative of a low resistance state (LRS), meaning the on state has already formed before the resistive switching cycles. Applying a positive voltage of 0 V → 2.5 V → 0 V (corresponding to processes 1 and 2 in Fig. 2a) without a compliance current, the resistance is increased to more than 104 Ω which is attributed to a high resistance state (HRS, off state). MA3Sb2Br9 undergoes a RESET process at the beginning due to the change in resistance from LRS to HRS. Applying a negative voltage of 0 V → −0.5 V → 0 V (corresponding to processes 3 and 4 in Fig. 2a) without a compliance current, the resistance is decreased to reach LRS again. So, the negative bias induces a SET process due to the change in resistance from HRS to LRS. The initial LRS implies that MA3Sb2Br9 does not need a forming process and the conducting filament is already self-formed before applying the voltage, which is contrary to most bipolar memristors which require a forming process to construct the conducting filament under an electric field.8,16 To explain the forming-free LRS of an MA3Sb2Br9 based memristor, it is necessary to explain whether the resistive switching is caused by electrochemical metallization of the Ag electrodes or valence change of the MA3Sb2Br9 film. For electrochemical metallization of the Ag electrodes, metallic Ag should be oxidized to form a conducting pathway.53 The resistance of memristor devices was reported to change mostly from HRS to LRS with a positive voltage when electrochemical metallization of Ag was involved.53,54 The initial change from LRS to HRS in MA3Sb2Br9 film upon a positive voltage sweep might not be related to electrochemical metallization, which is further confirmed by a similar switching phenomenon occurring when gold is used as the top electrode (Fig. S2†). In terms of the valence change of MA3Sb2Br9 film, a filament of carbon or Sb cannot be expected to form because CH3NH3 is stable in the lattice and octahedral Sb is hard to move.51,55 Therefore, the valence change of Sb by the movement of a bromide vacancy in MA3Sb2Br9 film is considered to correlate with the resistive switching of MA3Sb2Br9. Cao et al. suggested that the existence of metallic Gd and initially formed oxygen defects in GdO3 film could be responsible for the forming-free characteristics and self-formed conducting filament.16 To investigate the existence of metallic Sb and initially formed bromide defects similar to metallic Gd in GdO3, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) of MA3Sb2Br9 film on an ITO substrate was measured (Fig. 2b). Two strong peaks in Sb 3d XPS at 529.43 eV and 538.73 eV correspond to Sb3+, while two weak peaks at a lower binding energy of 527.13 eV and 536.38 eV are attributed to metallic Sb.56–59 During the fabrication of MA3Sb2Br9 film, a bromide vacancy may be generated by thermal annealing60 and a bromide vacancy can trigger a redox reaction which can reduce interstitial Sb3+ to metallic Sb,61,62 which means a valence change of Sb is caused by a bromide vacancy. Therefore, the presence of metallic Sb and underlying Br defects are responsible for the initial LRS (Fig. 2c), which is different from the switching process via a forming stage. Since metallic Sb is output, caused by a bromide vacancy, the formation and rupture of the conducting filament are caused by movement of a bromide vacancy although metallic Sb contributes to the initial LRS, so the self-formed conducting filament is expected to be ruptured due to the movement of a bromide vacancy to the bottom electrode and heat generated by the current flow, which is followed by switching cycles.

Fig. 3a shows the I–V characteristics of MA3Sb2Br9 based memristors on a semilogarithmic scale at room temperature after the initial RESET. To measure the I–V curves of the devices, controlled voltages of 0 V, −0.5 V, 0 V, and 1 V are applied to one of the top Ag electrodes under a direct current (DC) sweep with the bottom (ITO) electrode grounded without a compliance current. Although a compliance current is one way to protect memristor devices from breaking down, it may result in a complicated circuit design.63 Therefore, the absence of a compliance current would decrease the complexity in the memristor circuit. A compliance current-independent property is observed in Ag/MA3Sb2Br9/ITO (Fig. S3†) and Au/MA3Sb2Br9/ITO (Fig. S4†) devices. The change from HRS to LRS near 0.18 V (SET process) is observed upon applying a voltage from 0 V to −0.5 V. When the applied voltage changes from 0 V to +1 V, switching from LRS to HRS occurs near 0.37 V (RESET process). The cycling endurance was investigated, where consecutive DC voltage pulses were applied to evaluate the electrical stability under VSET = −0.5 V and VRESET = 1.2 V. The reading voltage and the pulse width are 0.01 V and 1 ms, respectively. Fig. 3b shows that MA3Sb2Br9 exhibits stable resistive switching over 300 cycles with an on/off ratio of ∼102. The data retention time at HRS and LRS is estimated to be over 104 (Fig. 3c), which is similar to that of Pb-based perovskite materials.35,36 Since the operating voltage of MA3Sb2Br9 based memristors is as low as 0.4 V, the thermal voltage at room temperature (0.025 V) can disturb retention, resulting in a small fluctuation in retention characteristics.36 The I–V characteristic for 30 cells in 1 device and 6 different devices are shown in Fig. 3d and Fig. S5.† The average resistances for HRS and LRS at 0.01 V are 2753.7135 Ω and 84.8565 Ω, respectively, so the average on/off ratio is 32.45. The maximum on/off ratio is 73.7, where the resistances for LRS and HRS are 79.5 Ω and 5855.0 Ω, respectively.

The multilevel storage property was investigated because it is important to increase the storage density.43,64 Three levels of LRS are shown in Fig. 4a, where the compliance current is varied from 10 mA to 5 mA and 1 mA, for a positive voltage sweep. The resistance of HRS is almost the same, while the resistance of LRS is increased as the compliance current is decreased. This means that LRS can be controlled during the SET process by varying the compliance current. This result shows the multilevel storage capability of MA3Sb2Br9. We also measured several numbers of writing cycles to verify the reliability of the multilevel storage characteristics (Fig. 4b). The resistances of LRS and HRS are read at Vread = 0.01 V, where the pulse voltages of the SET and RESET process are −0.5 V and 1.2 V, respectively. As can be seen in Fig. 4b, the resistance of HRS is very stable at all compliance currents, along with a distinct resistance of LRS for each compliance current.

(b) Resistive switching of MA3Sb2Br9 based memristors over 30 cycles with different compliance currents of 10 mA, 5 mA and 1 mA. The switching voltage was −0.5 V and 1.0 V. The pulse width was 1 ms. 
Under the assumption that the filament is formed by the valence change of Sb due to the migration of a bromide vacancy, we investigated the conduction mechanism of MA3Sb2Br9 based memristors with natural logarithmic I–V plots in the SET process and the RESET process (Fig. 5). For the SET process in Fig. 5a, the slopes of HRS at a low electric field and a high electric field are different. At a low electric field (0 V to −0.07 V), the slope of 1.01 is indicative of Ohmic conduction, meaning that current flow by electrons located in the conduction band is governed by thermal excitation.65 However, a higher slope value of 2.05 at a high electric field implies a space charge limited current (SCLC).65 When voltages larger than −0.10 V are applied at HRS, the current abruptly increases and the slope changes to 1.01, which indicates that the SET process occurs and the conducting filament is well established by the SET process. For the RESET process in Fig. 5b, the slope of 1.00 for LRS means Ohmic conduction, which is consistent with the mechanism for LRS in the SET process.36,66 When the applied voltage is close to 0.4 V, a sudden decrease in current is attributed to the RESET process. During the RESET process, the conducting filament is expected to be disrupted and the state of resistance changes from LRS to HRS. At a high electric field for HRS, the slope is neither 1.00 nor 2.00, which suggests that the conducting mechanism is neither Ohmic nor SCLC. We re-plotted the current with respect to V1/2 (Fig. 5c), at a high electric field for HRS in the RESET process and it is well fitted by a linear line. This suggests that thermionic emission conduction is involved, according to eqn (1).65 (1)where A is Richardson's constant, T is absolute temperature, q is electronic charge, ε is dielectric permittivity and k is Boltzmann's constant.65 For thermionic emission conduction, the heat generated by a high electric field makes electrons overcome the potential barrier between the conduction band minimum of MA3Sb2Br9 and the work function of the Ag electrode so current can flow.65,67 At a low electric field for HRS, the heat generated by voltage is decreased so electrons cannot overcome the potential barrier. As a result, the current is dependent only on the thermally excited electrons of MA3Sb2Br9, so Ohmic conduction occurs again at a low electric field for HRS.

The overall conductance change of memristor devices caused by a gradually formed conducting filament due to the valence change of Sb in MA3Sb2Br9 is analogous to the synaptic weight change caused by movement of Ca2+ in biological synapses (Fig. 6a), which means that an MA3Sb2Br9 based memristor can be applied to neuromorphic computing.37,39,68,69 The postsynaptic current (PSC) decays over time after a 500 μs pulse of −0.05 V, where the PSC is increased from 0.914 μA to 1.146 μA and the change in synaptic weight ΔG is +25.4% calculated as (Ifinal − Iinitial)/Iinitial (Fig. 6b).70 This is indicative of an excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC)37 in synaptic devices, where the partially formed conducting filament is maintained in MA3Sb2Br9. Whereas the PSC is raised over time after a 500 μs pulse of +0.9 V, where the PSC decreases from 1.19 μA to 1.10 μA and ΔG is −7.6% (Fig. 6c). This phenomenon is indicative of the inhibitory postsynaptic current (IPSC)71 of synaptic devices, where a partially ruptured conducting filament is retained in MA3Sb2Br9. For information, the insets in Fig. 6b and c exhibit a peak current at −0.05 V and +0.9 V pulses. Energy consumption depends on IVt/cell area, where I is the peak current in PSC, V is the amplitude of the pulse and t is the duration of the pulse.69 Therefore, energy consumption is estimated to be 117.9 fJ μm−2 from a peak current of 37.4 μA under a 500 μs pulse at −0.05 V and a radius of the electrode of 50 μm (energy/area = 37.4 μA × 0.05 V × 500 μs/(π × 50 × 50 μm2) = 117.9 fJ μm−2). Compared to the energy consumption of other materials, such as oxides, chalcogenide and Pb-based perovskite materials (Table 1), MA3Sb2Br9 can be categorized as a low-energy-consumption neuromorphic material. Long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) depending on the voltage pulse are shown in Fig. 6d. As the number of −0.05 V pulses is increased, the PSC is sequentially increased, which is analogous to sequentially raised synaptic weight in biological synapses.70–72 However, PSC is decreased as the number of +0.9 V pulse is increased, corresponding to sequentially decayed synaptic weight in biological synapses.70–72 In spike timing dependent plasticity (STDP), the synaptic weight in biological synapses is determined by the time interval of the spike between presynaptic terminal and postsynaptic terminal.70,73 To emulate STDP, spikes of same type were applied to the bottom electrode and top electrode at specific time intervals, where the bottom ITO electrode and the top Ag electrode correspond to presynaptic neuron and postsynaptic neuron, respectively (Fig. 6e). The STDP behavior of MA3Sb2Br9 memristor devices is depicted in Fig. 6f. The time interval between presynaptic and postsynaptic spikes is defined as Δt (Δt = tpre − tpost).70,73 The synaptic weight becomes potentiated (ΔG > 0) if the postsynaptic spike arrives before the presynaptic spike (Δt > 0). On the other hand, the synaptic weight gets depressed (ΔG < 0) when the presynaptic spike arrives earlier than the postsynaptic spike (Δt < 0). Potentiation and depression are negatively dependent on the time interval between postsynaptic and presynaptic spikes, where potentiation and depression become stronger as Δt gets closer to 0. This characteristic indicates that MA3Sb2Br9 can emulate the STDP of biological synapses.

Conclusions
We have investigated the resistive switching property for an antimony-based perovskite-like MA3Sb2Br9. Initially formed metallic Sb and bromide vacancies in the as-prepared MA3Sb2Br9 induced a self-formed conducting filament and forming-free characteristics. The MA3Sb2Br9 based memristor exhibited reproducible and reliable bipolar resistive switching behavior with an endurance of 300 cycles and a retention time of ∼104 s, along with a capability of multilevel data storage characteristics of at least three data levels. Synaptic behaviors such as EPSC, IPSC, LTP, LTD and STDP were observed and an energy consumption as low as 117.9 fJ μm−2 was estimated from the MA3Sb2Br9 based memristor. Our studies revealed that MA3Sb2Br9 is a potential candidate not only for resistive switching but also for neuromorphic computing.
Experimental section
Device fabrication
ITO-coated glass was ultrasonically cleaned with detergent, ethanol, acetone and ethanol, and was further treated by UV-ozone for 20 min before spin-coating the MA3Sb2Br9 film. A 35 wt% MA3Sb2Br9 precursor solution was prepared by dissolving 1.5 mmol of MABr (168.0 mg) (Lumtec, >99.5%) and 1 mmol of SbBr3 (361.5 mg) (Alfa Aesar, 99.995%) in dimethylformamide (DMF) (1.05 ml) (Aldrich, 99.8%). The precursor solution was spin-coated on ITO at 4000 rpm for 20 s (acceleration = 1200 rpm s−1), into which toluene (0.2 ml, Aldrich, 99.8%) was dripped after 15 s of spinning. The spin-coated film was annealed at 100 °C for 10 min. Poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) solution was prepared by dissolving 10 mg of PMMA (Alpha Aesar, 550000 MW) in 1 ml of chlorobenzene (Aldrich), and stirring for 24 h. A thin layer of PMMA was deposited on the annealed MA3Sb2Br9 by a spin-coating method. A 150 nm-thick Ag or Au top electrode was thermally evaporated on the PMMA film under 1.0 × 10−6 Torr at room temperature.
Characterizations
The cross-sectional device structure was investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (JSM7500F, JEOL). X-ray diffraction (XRD) data were obtained by a D8 ADVANCE diffractometer (Bruker, 18 kW) with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å). Resistive switching properties were collected by a Keithley 4200 semiconductor parametric analyzer using the direct current voltage sweeping mode. All electrical measurements were performed under 10−2 Torr in a vacuum probe station. A direct current voltage pulse was used to measure resistive switching cycling (pulse width of 1 ms for LRS and HRS).
