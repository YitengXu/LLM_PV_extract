    , Accepted 7th March 2022First published on 7th March 2022AbstractSemi-transparent organic solar cells (ST-OSCs) have shown great potential for integration into the windows of buildings. An absorption region that is dominated by photovoltaic materials is vital for ST-OSCs. However, the state-of-the-art polymer donors are not specially tailored for ST-OSC applications and have a strong absorption in the visible region. Therefore, two polymers, namely 44-PTB and 66-PTB, are rationally designed by combining a benzodithiophene and two fluorinated thienothiophenes (FTT) in the repeat unit. Benefiting from the donor–acceptor–acceptor (D–A–A) configuration, the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) effect is thus enhanced to red-shift the absorption of the corresponding polymers. Meanwhile, the regioregularity caused by the asymmetric structure of the FTT significantly affects the molecular geometry of these polymers. Compared with 44-PTB, 66-PTB with a more planar skeleton has a bathochromic and strong absorption in the near-infrared (NIR) region, which is conducive to improving the photon harvest and transmittance. In addition, the relatively planar backbone helps 66-PTB to achieve better intermolecular packing and form a fibrous structure in the film. As the result, the opaque device based on 66-PTB achieved a PCE of 7.84%, while the PCE of the device based on 44-PTB is only 5.93%. More importantly, ST-OSCs based on 66-PTB realize an average visible transmittance (AVT) as high as 50.82% accompanied by a PCE of 5.11%, which is among only a few ST-OSCs with a >50% AVT. The color rendering index (CRI) is 74.09, and the colour coordinates are (0.294,0.338), which are meet the requirements of windows used in civil architecture.
Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) have been intensively investigated in the past decades as an emerging technology for green energy.1–5 To ensure efficient charge diffusion and collection during the photon-to-electron conversion, a very thin (∼100 nm) active layer is usually present in OSCs, which gives OSCs the extra capability of transparency.6–8 With this unique merit, semi-transparent organic solar cells (ST-OSCs) have been identified as important components for building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPVs) and smart window technologies.9–11 To meet the requirements of potential applications, ST-OSCs should maintain a high transmittance while providing a decent power conversion efficiency (PCE). However, there is a trade-off between the transmittance and the PCE in ST-OSCs.12 Generally, the average visible transmittance (AVT), which is defined as the average value of transmittance for the ST-OSCs in the visible-light wavelength range (370–740 nm) according to the photonic response of the human eye, is used to assess the transmission.13 One of the more prominent strategies is to reduce the absorption in the visible range to enhance the AVT in ST-OSCs, leading to a relatively low photon current. In addition, the colour rendering index (CRI) and the colour coordinates (x,y) are other important criteria that evaluate the colour properties of ST-OSCs. The CRI value, which ranges from 0 to 100, describes quantitatively the accuracy of the colour of a given object through a semi-transparent device with respect to a reference light source, and a higher CRI indicates a better colour rendering ability and a higher neutral colour degree.14 For window applications, it is preferred that the colour coordinates of neutral coloured ST-OSCs are close to (0.333,0.333) or that of AM 1.5G (0.332,0.334).9,15 So far, the PCEs of ST-OSCs have been boosted to over 10% with an AVT of around 20–40%.16–19 However, the poor AVT limits the potential applications of ST-OSCs in smart windows, which require over 50% transparency and good neutral-colour perception.9
Approaches to device engineering, such as photonic crystals,20–23 antireflection coatings,24–26 optical microcavity structures27–29 and dielectric/metal/dielectric (DMD) structures,30–32 have all been shown to significantly enhance the transmittance properties of ST-OSCs. High transparency could be realized by developing photovoltaic materials that can selectively harvest solar radiation in the ranges of ultraviolet (UV) or near-infrared (NIR) light. Attributed to innovations in non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs), the photovoltaic and transparent properties of ST-OSCs have advanced with the utilization of narrow-bandgap NFAs.12,33–39 By contrast, the progress in donor materials for ST-OSCs lags far behind that of NFAs. For example, Lee et al. reported ST-OSCs with a modest PCE of 5.7%, utilizing the DPP-based donor DPP2T, which absorbs in the NIR region, resulting in a high transmittance in the range of 400–600 nm.40 Xie et al. developed the PDTP–DFBT:FOIC system, which achieved an AVT of 52–61.5% and a PCE of 3.5–4.2%.41 Jiang and co-workers constructed an ST-OSC based on PM2 and Y6-BO with an AVT of 43% and a PCE of 6%.42 In most highly efficient ST-OSCs, the preferred choice of donor materials remains the low-bandgap polymer PTB7-Th.21,22,37,43–48 Unfortunately, the absorption spectrum of PTB7-Th covers the range of 550–750 nm, which instinctively restrains the transmittance in the visible region of the device. Therefore, the rational design of ideal donors that match the narrow-bandgap NFAs is vital for simultaneously improving the photovoltaic and transparent properties of ST-OSCs.
To extend the absorption of conjugated polymers into the NIR region, one successful strategy has been to alternate electron-rich (D) and electron-deficient (A) units along the backbone to form a push–pull structure, shrinking the bandgap of the corresponding polymers due to the effects of intramolecular charge transfer (ICT).49,50 For example, PTB7-Th, as the widely used donor in ST-OSCs, has a D–A structure comprised of benzodithiophene (BDT, D unit) and fluorinated thienothiophene (FTT, A unit). Considering the promising performance of PTB7-Th in ST-OSCs, it has been speculated that the ICT effect can be strengthened by employing two FTT units to replace the single FTT, thereby leading to a bathochromic absorption of the relevant polymer with the D–A–A structure. In addition, our previous studies have shown that the regioregularity of PTB7-Th caused by the asymmetric structure of the FTT unit significantly affects the physicochemical properties and device performance.51,52 Thus, the connection site of the FTT unit might play a crucial in determining the absorption as well as other properties of the corresponding polymers. Herein, two polymers, namely 44-PTB and 66-PTB, are rationally designed (Scheme 1). As expected, the polymer 66-PTB, wherein two FTT units are connected at the 6-position, achieves a strong absorption in the NIR region from 650 to 850 nm. The analogue 44-PTB, with the 4-position as the connection site, shows a similar absorption with PTB7-Th. These results can be rationalized by the bis-FTT isomers 44-FTT and 66-FTT showing significantly different planarities of the polymer backbones. By blending 66-PTB with the narrow-bandgap acceptor IEICO-4F, the opaque OSC device under optimized conditions achieves a decent PCE of 7.84%, even though the active layer can only harvest the photons in the NIR region. Using a thin Ag electrode (10 nm) and a capping layer of MoO3 (50 nm), the ST-OSC exhibits a PCE of 5.11% with an extremely high AVT of 50.82%, which is one of few examples of an ST-OSC with an AVT of over 50%.

Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization
The synthetic routes of 44-PTB and 66-PTB are shown in Scheme 1. Owing to the outstanding chemical selectivity of the FTT unit, it can readily deprotonate at the 6-position using the active reagent 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidinylmagnesium chloride lithium chloride complex (TMPMgCl·LiCl). Thus, the bis-FTT isomers 44-FTT and 66-FTT are synthesized via a two-step process in high yields. The chemical structures of the monomers were confirmed via1H NMR, 13C NMR and mass spectra, as shown in the ESI.† The polymers 44-PTB and 66-PTB were prepared via Stille coupling with the corresponding monomers. The molecular weight (Mn) and polydispersity index (Đ) were measured using gel permeation chromatography, giving, respectively, 57.4 kDa and 2.2 for 44-PTB and 77.2 kDa and 2.4 for 66-PTB. These two polymers show good solubility in common organic solvents such as chloroform, chlorobenzene, and o-dichlorobenzene.
To unravel the effect of regioregularity on the molecular geometry, theoretical simulations based on density functional theory (DFT) at the B3LYP/6-31G (d, p) level were performed to calculate the optimized conformations of 44-PTB and 66-PTB, wherein three repeating units are employed and the alkyl chains are simplified as methyl groups to facilitate the calculation. As shown in Fig. 1, the geometries of 44-PTB and 66-PTB show obvious configurational differences, which are mainly reflected in the dihedral angle between the two FTT units. The optimized geometry of 44-PTB presents a dihedral angle of 35.8°, while the angle in 66-PTB is as small as 2.2°, indicating that the backbone of 66-PTB is much more planar relative to 44-PTB. The electron distributions of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) were also obtained from the theoretical calculations. As shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†), it is evident that the LUMO of 66-PTB is more delocalized, owing to the relatively small dihedral angle between the two FTT units in 66-PTB. Meanwhile, the molecular geometry also affects the energy levels. Although the energy levels of the HOMO are similar in 44-PTB (−4.79 eV) and 66-PTB (−4.80 eV), the different twist angles between the two FTT units bring about a remarkable distinction for the LUMO, as −2.87 eV for 44-PTB and −2.91 eV for 66-PTB. In addition, these two molecules exhibit similar dihedral angles between the adjacent BDT and FTT units due to the steric hindrance of the sidechains. The relatively large twist angle might be detrimental to the conjugation. However, our previous studies have demonstrated that the fluorine atom can interact with the hydrogen atom of the side-chain thiophene ring in the BDT unit;52 such an interaction that only exists in 66-PTB can make the dihedral angle between the BDT and FTT units much smaller in the real situation, which will further enhance the planarity of 66-PTB. We also acquired the optimized conformations of the bis-FTT groups connected at the 4- or 6-positions, revealing that the dihedral angle of the 4-position-connected bis-FTT is 54.06°, whereas that of the 6-position-connected bis-FTT is only 0.68° (Fig. S2, ESI†), further illustrating that the different regioregularities of the bis-FTT isomers have a great impact on the polymer geometry.

The UV-vis-NIR absorption spectra of the two polymers were examined in chloroform solution and as thin films (Fig. 2 and Table 1). The absorption spectrum of 66-PTB in chloroform solution ranging from 600 to 850 nm shows the maximum peak at 758 nm, while 44-PTB exhibits a more blue-shifted absorption from 550 to 800 nm with the maximum peak at 695 nm. The extinction coefficients of 44-PTB and 66-PTB are 3.74 × 104 M−1 cm−1 and 6.10 × 104 M−1 cm−1, respectively. In the solid-state films, 44-PTB and 66-PTB show more red-shifted spectra with maximum peaks at 710 nm and 785 nm respectively. Compared with 44-PTB, the planar backbone and large conjugation endow 66-PTB with a higher extinction coefficient and more red-shifted absorption, which are beneficial for photon harvesting and transmittance in ST-OSCs. Notably, the absorption of the 66-PTB film is mainly in the range from 650 nm to 850 nm, suggesting that the design principle of the D–A–A structure has successfully adjusted the absorption to the NIR range, better fitting the human-eye response (narrowly distributed in the visible spectrum of 380–700 nm)13 compared with PTB7-Th, the donor commonly used for ST-OSCs. This indicates that 66-PTB has great potential in ST-OSCs (Fig. S3, ESI†). The absorption onset of the 44-PTB and 66-PTB films is at 813 nm and 871 nm, which corresponds to the optical bandgaps of 1.53 eV and 1.42 eV, respectively. The electrochemical properties of the films were examined using cyclic voltammetry (Fig. S4, ESI†). Based on the cyclic voltammetry results and the optical bandgap, the HOMO and LUMO energy levels are estimated to be −5.35 eV and −3.82 eV (44-PTB), −5.30 eV and −3.88 eV (66-PTB), respectively (Fig. 2c and Table 1). 44-PTB exhibits a higher LUMO compared with 66-PTB, which is mainly related to the lower degree of charge delocalization caused by the poor planarity of the 44-PTB backbone.

Photovoltaic properties
Opaque devices with the conventional configuration of glass/indium tin oxide (ITO)/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/PDINO/Ag were fabricated to examine the photovoltaic performance of 44-PTB and 66-PTB. To complement the absorption and energy levels of the blend, a narrow-bandgap NFA (i.e., IEICO-4F) was selected as the acceptor (Fig. S5, ESI†). In particular, IEICO-4F has a strong absorption in the NIR region of 700–1000 nm (Fig. 2b). As shown in Tables S1 and S2 in the ESI,† the devices were optimized by tuning the D/A ratio, the processing additive and post-treatment. The photovoltaic parameters of the optimal devices are summarized in Table 2. The corresponding current-density/voltage (J–V) curves and external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves are shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†). The 66-PTB:IEICO-4F-based device achieves a PCE of 7.84% with a VOC of 0.66 V, a JSC of 17.14 mA cm−2, and an FF of 66.4%. The device based on 44-PTB:IEICO-4F exhibits a VOC of 0.76 V, a JSC of 14.77 mA cm−2, an FF of 50.5%, leading to a PCE of 5.93%. Compared with 66-PTB, the device based on 44-PTB shows a higher VOC, which is consistent with the higher LUMO. However, 66-PTB has a more bathochromic and stronger absorption, leading to a significantly higher JSC. Meanwhile, the FF of 66-PTB-based device is also superior to that of the 44-PTB-based device, which might be related to the film morphology caused by the different molecular geometry. The EQE spectra show that the device based on 44-PTB has a lower response over the whole range. The integrated current densities, which are 14.93 mA cm−2 and 16.97 mA cm−2 for the 44-PTB- and 66-PTB-based devices, respectively, are within the 5% mismatch of the JSC values from the J–V curve.

Considering the NIR absorption of 66-PTB, semi-transparent devices were fabricated based on 66-PTB:IEICO-4F, while an ultra-thin silver layer with different thicknesses was used as the top electrode to improve the AVT of the device. As shown in Fig. S7 and Table S3 (ESI†), the maximum PCE/AVT values are 6.56%/22.17%, 6.17%/29.47%, and 5.51%/38.66% for the ST-OSCs with 20, 15, and 10-nm-thick Ag layers, respectively. Reducing the thickness of the Ag layer significantly increases the AVT but reduces the PCE. The light utilization efficiency (LUE), which is calculated by multiplying the PCE and AVT, is applied to evaluate the performance of the ST-OSCs. As listed in Table 2, the ST-OSC based on 10-nm-thick Ag shows the best LUE of 2.13% with a VOC of 0.65 V, a JSC of 13.08 mA cm−2, an FF of 63.3%, and a maximum PCE of 5.51%. The fact that the values of JSC clearly decrease with a smaller silver thickness can be an indication that the light reflected by the thicker metal electrode is re-absorbed by the active layer. To further enhance the AVT, a thin layer of MoO3 as an optical capping layer, due to its high refractive index (n = 2.0–2.3),18,53,54 is incorporated on the top of the 10 nm Ag layer to increase the light transmission in the visible region. Fig. 3 shows the characteristic J–V curves, EQE, and transmission spectra of the 66-PTB:IEICO-4F-based ST-OSCs. As shown in Fig. S8 and Table S4 (ESI†), the JSC gradually decreases from 13.08 mA cm−2 to 12.02 mA cm−2 as the MoO3 layer is increased from 0 to 50 nm, which is attributed to greater light transmittance in the region of 450–900 nm, as evidenced by the EQE curves. Thus, the maximum PCE of the device with 50 nm MoO3 (5.11%) is slightly lower than the device without MoO3 (5.51%). However, the AVT value is greatly enhanced from 38.66% (without MoO3) to 50.82% (with 50 nm MoO3). As a result, the introduction of the MoO3 capping layer eventually improves the LUE to 2.60%. Notably, the device is one of only a few ST-OSCs that have an AVT exceeding 50%.55–58 The great improvement in visible transmission of ST-OSCs using MoO3 can be clearly seen from the photos shown in Fig. 3e. The view through the devices becomes clearer and brighter after capping with the MoO3 layer. As shown in Fig. S8 (ESI†), the transmittance in the range of 450–600 nm increases with the incorporation of MoO3 on the Ag electrode. As a result, a CRI of 74.09 is achieved with a MoO3 thickness of 50 nm (Table S5, ESI†). Meanwhile, the colour coordinates shift from (0.281,0.319) to (0.294,0.338) after the MoO3 deposition, approaching the standard AM 1.5G (0.332,0.334) (Fig. 3d and Table S5, ESI†). The improved CRI and colour coordinates enable the ST-OSCs to achieve the relatively neutral colour of glass windows, which is beneficial for the application of ST-OSCs in building-integrated photovoltaics and smart windows.59,60

Charge separation, transport, and recombination
To study the charge behaviour, the hole (μh) and electron (μe) mobilities were evaluated using the space-charge limited current (SCLC) method with hole-only devices ITO/PEDOT:PSS/donors:IEICO-4F/MoO3/Ag and electron-only devices ITO/ZnO/donors:IEICO-4F/ZnO/Ag (Fig. S9, ESI†). The device made with the 44-PTB:IEICO-4F blend shows relatively low μh and μe values of 9.07 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 6.40 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The μh and μe of 66-PTB:IEICO-4F (1.34 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 9.92 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively) are higher than those of the 44-PTB:IEICO-4F blend. The 66-PTB-based blend film shows a more balanced μh/μe ratio of 1.32 compared with the 44-PTB-based blend (μh/μe = 1.42). The increased and more balanced charge transport is favourable for achieving higher FF and JSC values, which are consistent with the photovoltaic properties of these two polymers. To further explore the intrinsic reasons for the different performance of these donor polymers, the exciton dissociation and charge recombination were investigated. Fig. 4a shows the relationship curves of the photocurrent density (Jph) versus the effective voltage (Veff) for the devices based on 44-PTB:IEICO-4F and 66-PTB:IEICO-4F. It is assumed that the photo-generated exciton is completely dissociated into free charge carriers, resulting in the saturation photocurrent density (Jsat) when the Veff is high enough (>2 V). The exciton dissociation probability (Pdiss) and the charge collection probability (Pcoll) are determined from the values of Jph/Jsat in which Jph is obtained under short-circuit and maximal-power-output conditions, respectively. As shown in Fig. 4a, the Pdiss/Pcoll of the devices based on 44-PTB and 66-PTB are calculated as 91.8%/70.0% and 91.0%/76.8%, respectively, indicating that these two devices have a similar exciton dissociation, although the charge collection in the device based on 66-PTB is better than with 44-PTB. To understand the origin of the better charge collection of the 66-PTB based device, the charge recombination kinetics were studied by comparing the dependence of both VOC and JSC on the varying light intensity (Plight) of the devices (Fig. 4b and c, respectively). The relationship of the dependence of VOC on Plight can be described as VOC ∝ ln(Plight)kBT/q. The bimolecular recombination is defined to be a major channel of recombination losses when the slope is close to kBT/q, while the trap-assisted recombination is the major channel of recombination losses if the slope is close to 2kBT/q. The 44-PTB- and 66-PTB-based devices display slopes of 1.048kBT/q and 1.016kBT/q, respectively, indicating there is less trap-assisted recombination in the 66-PTB-based device. Meanwhile, the dependence of JSC upon the light intensity is described as JSC ∝ (Plight)α, where α refers to the situation of bimolecular recombination. The α values of the 44-PTB- and 66-PTB-based devices are 0.865 and 0.875, respectively, revealing that the bimolecular recombination is more suppressed in the 66-PTB:IEICO-4F-based devices. It can be concluded that the 44-PTB device suffers from higher bimolecular recombination losses than the 66-PTB device, which related to its twisted molecular skeleton. The charge behaviour of the ST-OSCs was also investigated. As shown in Fig. 4d–f, the exciton dissociation and charge collection probabilities become worse as the thickness of the silver electrode is decreased. Meanwhile, the charge recombination, both trap-assisted and bimolecular recombination, is slightly deteriorative in the ST-OSCs. These results, which are also observed in the previous ST-OSCs, are related to the lower conductivity of the thin metal electrode.17,19 However, the introduction of MoO3 as the capping layer hardly affects the charge recombination and collection.

Morphology characterization
To investigate the effect of the different regioregularities on the film morphology, the 44-PTB and 66-PTB pristine films as well as the blend films were characterized using atomic force microscopy (AFM). As displayed in Fig. 5, the neat film of 44-PTB presents a relatively smooth and uniform surface with a root-mean-squared roughness (RMS) of 0.85 nm. By contrast, the 66-PTB shows a clear nanofiber structure with a larger RMS of 1.16 nm, indicating enhanced crystallinity. The diversity of the topographic morphology of these polymer films further demonstrates that the planar skeleton of 66-PTB is beneficial for the intermolecular packing to further self-assemble into fibres. A similar trend is evident in the blend films. The RMS values of the 44-PTB:IEICO-4F blend and the 66-PTB:IEICO-4F blend are 1.86 nm and 3.50 nm, respectively, which can be rationalized by the different crystallinities of these two polymers.

Grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) was further carried out to reveal the microstructure of the blend films. Fig. S10 (ESI†) shows the 2D-GIWAX patterns and the corresponding 1D profiles in the out-of-plane (OOP) and in-plane (IP) directions for the 44-PTB:IEICO-4F and 66-PTB:IECIO-4F blend films. For the 44-PTB:IEICO-4F and 66-PTB:IEICO-4F blend films, the (010) diffraction peaks are shown in the OOP direction at 1.799 Å−1 and 1.800 Å−1, corresponding to the π–π distances of 3.490 Å and 3.488 Å, respectively, indicating that there is a preference for face-on orientation in both blend films. The crystal coherence length (CCL) values were evaluated from the full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) shown in Table S6 (ESI†). The (010) peak in the OOP direction of the 66-PTB-based blend film exhibits a smaller FWHM, implying that the π–π stacking CCL (65.10 Å) is much longer than that of the 44-PTB-based blend film (52.68 Å). The longer CCL of the π–π stacking indicates the stronger crystallinity of the 66-PTB:IEICO-4F film, which is consistent with the AFM results.
Conclusions
Briefly, the combination of an electron-rich unit (BDT) and two electron-deficient units (FTT) is employed as the repeating motif to compose two conjugated polymers with the D–A–A structure, wherein the bis-FTT moiety can strengthen the electron-withdrawing ability to enhance the intramolecular transfer. The different connection sites of the asymmetric FTT unit result in two polymer analogues: 44-PTB and 66-PTB. The regioregularity of these two polymers significantly affects the molecular geometry in which 66-PTB shows a more planar backbone compared with 44-PTB, thereby enlarging its conjugation and improving its ICT effect, consequently leading to a more red-shifted absorption in the NIR region. In addition, the planar backbone also helps 66-PTB to achieve better intermolecular packing, as demonstrated by the absorption of the thin film and the AFM measurements. Due to their differences in molecular geometry, these two polymers show different photovoltaic performance, where the PCE of the 66-PTB-based device (7.84%) is much higher than that of the 44-PTB-based device (5.93%). More importantly, 66-PTB shows great potential in semi-transparent OSCs. Using the Ag/MoO3 transparent electrode, the 66-PTB-based ST-OSC achieved an AVT of 50.82% with colour coordinates of (0.294,0.338), which satisfies the criteria for applications in smart windows and in building-integrated photovoltaics. The work suggests that the transmittance properties of ST-OSCs can be improved via the rational design of NIR-absorbing polymer donors.
