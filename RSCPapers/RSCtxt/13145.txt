    , Accepted 27th July 2018First published on 30th July 2018AbstractSemiconducting quantum dots (QDs) have been considered as promising building blocks of solar energy harvesting systems because of size-dependent electronic structures, e.g. QD–metal heterostructures for solar-driven H2 production. In order to design improved systems, it is crucial to understand size-dependent QD–metal interfacial electron transfer dynamics, picosecond processes in particular. Here, we report that the transfer rates of photogenerated electrons in Pt-decorated CdS QDs can be varied over more than two orders of magnitude by controlling the QD size. In small QDs (2.8 nm diameter), conduction band electrons transfer to Pt sites in an average timescale of ∼30 ps, giving a transfer rate of 2.9 × 1010 s−1 while in significantly larger particles (4.8 nm diameter) the transfer rates decrease to 1.4 × 108 s−1. We attribute this to the tuning of the electron transfer driving force via the quantum confinement-controlled energetic off-set between the involved electronic states of the QDs and the co-catalyst. The same size-dependent trend is observed in the presence of an electron acceptor in solution. With methyl viologen present, electrons leave the QDs within 1 ps for 2.8 nm QDs while for 4.6 nm QDs this process takes nearly 40 ps. The transfer rates are directly correlated with H2 generation efficiencies: faster electron transfer leads to higher H2 generation efficiencies. 2.8 nm QDs display a H2 generation quantum efficiency of 17.3%, much higher than the 11.4% for their 4.6 nm diameter counterpart. We explain these differences by the fact that slower electron transfer cannot compete as efficiently as faster electron transfer with recombination and other losses.
Introduction
Ensuring a secure and sustainable energy supply is one of the foremost challenges of the 21st century. This challenge mainly stems from the limited supplies of fossil fuels and the need to cut down greenhouse gas emissions. Solar radiation, being the largest renewable energy source, will certainly play a major role in any future energy mix. Semiconducting quantum dots (QDs) have been considered as building blocks of solar radiation harvesting systems because QDs can utilize incident photons to generate separated charge carriers in QD sensitized solar cells and photocatalyst systems.1,2 Efficient transfer of charge carriers across a semiconductor interface is the key for converting solar energy into electricity or fuels.
The most appealing advantage of QDs is their size-dependent electronic structure, which can be applied to design systems with desired electronic and optical properties simply by controlling their size. Particularly, recent work has focused on the importance of QD size in optimizing charge transfer from QDs to various acceptors including oxides, inorganic complexes, organic compounds and carbon allotropes, thus enabling the use of QDs in photovoltaics.3–7 Charge transfer in each of the aforementioned systems has been recently studied using transient spectroscopic techniques. The dynamics of primary photo-induced processes (i.e. recombination, charge transfer, and trapping), which are crucial to understand the photophysical and photochemical processes in donor–acceptor systems, occur on timescales of sub-picoseconds to nanoseconds and can be studied in great detail using time-resolved photo-luminescence (PL) and ultrafast transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy techniques.8–11
QD–metal hybrids that combine the light-harvesting ability of QDs with the catalytic activity of small metal nanoparticles (NPs) show promising applications in photocatalysis, particularly in solar-driven H2 production. In order to design improved systems, it is crucial to understand the dynamics and kinetic details of interfacial charge carrier transfer.12–20 Although most of the photocatalytic studies focused on size-dependent activity and then connected this with band edge shifts and surface area changes,21–25 understanding of the size-dependent QD–metal interfacial electron-transfer dynamics, which is crucial to provide the design principle for improved systems, is still lacking.
A number of time-resolved PL measurements have been conducted on CdSe QD-Au NP systems, providing information on the size-dependent overall radiative decay processes that extend to the nanosecond time regime.26,27 However, early studies have shown that photogenerated charge carriers in a semiconductor nanoparticle can be transferred across the interface in picoseconds.12–20,28 To probe the size-dependent picosecond processes on photocatalytic QD–metal nano-heterostructures for the first time, we employed femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy measurements using 350 nm laser pulses (300 fs). Size-controlled CdS QDs decorated with Pt NPs were synthesized according to reported procedures.25 Acceleration of the charge carrier dynamics is observed with smaller nanocrystal sizes, which directly correlates with the higher quantum efficiencies for water splitting. A detailed analysis of the transient absorption data establishing these connections with H2 generation efficiencies is reported.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1 illustrates the CdS QDs and Pt/CdS samples. CdS QDs, a widely studied photocatalyst,13–16,21,22 of different diameters were synthesised in oleic acid/octadecene. The four different controlled diameters are 2.8, 3.1, 3.7 and 4.6 nm as determined from TEM imaging and the peak position of the first excitonic transition.29 They were phase transferred into aqueous solution using cysteine ligands and were decorated with sub-nm Pt clusters according to reported procedures.15,25Fig. 1A shows a scanning TEM image of the phase transferred CdS NCs. The average size is measured as 4.7 nm with a narrow size distribution (standard deviation of 0.2 nm). Element-sensitive high-angle annular dark field scanning TEM (HAADF-STEM) coupled with energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis is employed to investigate the morphology of Pt deposited CdS NCs, shown in Fig. 1B and C. Crystal lattice parameters were measured as shown in Fig. 1B and they match with the hexagonal wurtzite phase of CdS. The EDX result demonstrates that decorated Pt on the NCs was around 13 wt%, which agrees well with the Inductively Coupled Plasma-Optical Emission Spectrometry (ICP-OES) measurement of nearly 16 wt%. HAADF-STEM images of Pt/CdS coupled with EDX analysis confirm that the Pt clusters are well dispersed with a fine size (sub-nm, according to the reported values using the same Pt decorating procedures15) beyond the detection limit of the instrument. Fig. 1D shows the steady-state extinction spectra of the four QD samples. The narrow and sharp absorption peaks further illustrate the uniform size distribution of all the NCs with four sizes. A clear red-shift of the extinction onset and the peak position of the first excitonic transition (1S) is clearly displayed with increasing SNC diameter indicating strong quantum confinement and narrowing of the band gap in the SNCs. It should be noted that Pt/CdS samples show very similar extinction spectra as the corresponding pure QD samples, i.e. the Pt nanoclusters do not contribute significantly to the overall absorption.

(D) Extinction spectra and (E) transient absorption spectra recorded 1 ps following excitation of different-sized CdS QDs in aqueous solution; the horizontal dotted line represents ΔA equal to zero. 
When the CdS QD suspensions are excited by a 350 nm pump pulse (300 fs), photogenerated electrons and holes will populate the higher energy state and then relax and accumulate in the lower state within the laser pulse duration.30,31 Thus, with a delayed probe pulse in the near UV and visible region, bleaching of the absorption can be observed. The recovery of the transient bleaching (depletion of absorption) represents the dynamics of the photogenerated electrons and holes at the band edge including charge recombination, trapping and transfer processes. The absorption bleaching at the band edge of CdS is dominated by the presence of electrons in the conduction band, while holes at the conduction band edge have negligible contribution.16,32,33 Therefore, the bleaching at the band edge shown in the transient absorption provides an approach to probe the fate of electrons in the conduction band. Fig. 1E shows the differential absorption spectra of the different-sized CdS QDs recorded 1 ps after pump pulse excitation. The bleaching maximum of each of these different-sized CdS QDs is consistent with the 1S transition seen in the extinction spectrum.

Fig. 2 shows our key results, namely that a clear size dependence of the bleaching recovery of Pt/CdS nanocrystals is observed. Before going into the detailed analysis of individual traces, we start with a global discussion of all measurements. In Fig. 2A–D, there are eight traces of 1S bleaching recovery for all the CdS QDs with four sizes with and without Pt nanocluster decoration. All measurements show a fast rise at t = 0, followed by three distinct regions (ps fast decay, hundreds of ps decay and a slow ns decay all due to electron relaxation from the 1S state to a new state) in agreement with previous studies.3–5,17,28,33,34 To quantify these dynamics, the traces were fit with a triple exponential decay convoluted with the instrument response-function (IRF, Table S1†). In the absence of Auger recombination (the fluence of the 350 nm pump pulse is selected such that less than 10% of QDs are excited per pulse), initial dynamics are too fast to be associated with either radiative or non-radiative electron and hole recombination back to the ground state. Therefore, the initial fast decays are most possibly due to electron relaxation from the 1S state to a new state in the energy gap (e.g. surface-defect related for CdS, surface-defect related and Pt–CdS interface related for Pt/CdS). It should be noted that, as seen from the spectra in Fig. 2E and F, the decay of the TA signal is spectrally uniform meaning that the multiexponential relaxation behaviour is not related to size inhomogeneity (which would have resulted in a shift of the 1S bleaching).28

Transient absorption spectra of 4.6 nm CdS QDs (E) without and (F) with decorated Pt at selected time delays. (G) The transient bleach recovery of 2.8 nm Pt/CdS without and with the addition of MV2+. (H) The transient bleaching recovery of Pt/CdS with four sizes with the addition of MV2+. 
We now turn to the discussion of size-dependent dynamics. All four CdS QD sizes without Pt nanocluster decoration show a very similar bleaching recovery indicating that the 1S dynamics are not strongly dependent on NC size in the timescale and size range measured here. This is in good agreement with previous reports that the 1S dynamics are mostly affected by NC surface properties rather than NC size.3–5,28 Since all CdS QDs are prepared using identical procedures, no significant difference in surface properties is expected.
Interestingly, with the presence of Pt nanoclusters, transient bleaching recoveries of the QDs with four sizes become remarkably different. First, bleaching of each of these different-sized Pt/CdS QDs shows faster recovery compared to the corresponding QD samples, because the excited CdS QDs are capable of injecting electrons into the attached Pt nanoclusters; an additional decay channel leads to faster depopulation of the band edge states. In addition and more importantly, a clear acceleration of the dynamics with decreasing nanocrystal size is observed suggesting an increase in the transfer rate for the photoelectrons in smaller CdS NCs. Similar phenomena have been observed for charge transfer from QDs to various acceptors including oxides, inorganic complexes, organic compounds and carbon allotropes mainly used for photovoltaics applications.3–7
In order to provide more physical insight, we performed a quantitative analysis of our result. If electron transfer to Pt is the dominant additional pathway for the excited-state interaction between CdS and Pt, we can evaluate the rate constant by comparing the bleaching recovery lifetimes in the presence and absence of Pt.17,34ket = 1/τ(Pt/CdS) − 1/τ(CdS)
For the purpose of this analysis, τ is calculated as the amplitude-weighted average lifetime . All calculated results are summarised in Table 1. The fastest electron transfer in the Pt/CdS system was observed with the smallest CdS QDs of 2.8 nm. The rate constant of 2.9 × 1010 s−1 in this experiment reflects an average lifetime of 34 ps. The rate constants of 3.1, 3.7 and 4.6 nm are 4.1 × 109 s−1, 8.1 × 108 s−1 and 1.4 × 108 s−1 reflecting average lifetimes of 240 ps, 1.1 ns and 4.5 ns, respectively. The electron transfer rate from the smallest CdS QDs to Pt is comparable to typical rates from QDs to various acceptors including oxides, inorganic complexes, organic compounds and carbon allotropes.3–7 More relevantly, a rate constant of 1.22 × 109 s−1 was found from 3.6 nm CdSe QDs to Pt,17 which is close to that measured here from 3.7 nm CdS QDs to Pt. Half-life times (τ1/2, when 50% of the initial signal decays), which is another commonly used parameter in some relevant transient absorption work, follows the same trend and is also included in Table 1.

From the point of view of utilising photogenerated electrons for catalytic reactions, the established size-dependent dynamics of electron transfer from CdS to Pt is not sufficient. It is necessary to verify if the size-dependent dynamics still holds for an electron involved in an interfacial reaction. Therefore, methyl viologen (MV2+, a well-known electron scavenger35,36) is employed. The bleaching decays more rapidly with the addition of MV2+ (see Fig. 2G) and it is clear that electron transfer rates are still size dependent (Fig. 2H). The kinetic parameters in the presence of MV are summarised in Table 1 as well. In the presence of MV, electrons leave CdS within 1 ps in 2.8 nm QDs while in 4.6 nm QDs this process takes nearly 40 ps.
The main result of the size-dependent electron transfer is illustrated in Fig. 3A. The data of band edge positions are adapted from our previous work,25 demonstrating the widening band gap of smaller QDs in which both conduction and valence band edges shift away from their bulk values due to quantum confinement. The conduction band edge shows an increasing energy offset with smaller NC size relative to the Pt co-catalyst, i.e. larger driving force for electron transfer in the smaller nanocrystals. We thus attribute size-dependent electron transfer to the tunable electron transfer driving force, which is the result of the size-tunable band gap of the nanocrystals. The observed electron transfer rate increases with the driving force, suggesting that the reaction is in the Marcus normal regime.4,37 However, a more quantitative analysis applying Marcus Theory as reported elsewhere5 requires knowledge of the energetic off-sets between the QD conduction band edges and the LUMO position of the Pt clusters, i.e. ΔG. Since the Pt nanoclusters in all Pt/CdS QDs are prepared identically, we expect no significant difference in bulk and defect states (trap, surface, etc.). We therefore conclude that the density of accepting states in Pt has a negligible impact on the electron transfer rate, in contrast to a previous report.6
 Fig. 3  (A) Schematic representation of the electron transfer rate related to the quantum confinement induced energetic off-set between the electronic states of the semiconductor with respect to the co-catalyst (adapted from ref. 25. The LUMO position of Pt is only intended as a guide to the eye as we assume a constant HOMO–LUMO-gap for the Pt clusters across the differently sized SNCs). (B) The dependence of H2 efficiency and electron transfer rates on the energetic off-sets between the QD conduction band edges and the LUMO position of the Pt clusters (the band gap data are shown on the x-axis since the exact values for the off-sets are not available). 
Finally, we correlate the H2 internal quantum efficiency (IQE) of differently sized QDs (data adapted from our previous work25) to their electron transfer rates in Fig. 3B. In photocatalytic water splitting, 2.8 nm QDs produce H2 with an IQE of 17.3%, much higher than the 11.4% for their 4.6 nm diameter counterpart. 3.1 nm and 3.7 nm samples show efficiencies in between and all four data points form a linear trend against the band gap. The electron transfer rates of CdS to Pt and Pt/CdS to MV2+ are all plotted logarithmically versus band gap and closely follow the trend observed for the IQE.
Conclusions
In conclusion, ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy was used to study charge carrier dynamics in size-controlled Pt-decorated CdS QDs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time such size-dependent picosecond processes of QD–metal nanoheterostructures for photocatalysis have been systematically evaluated and correlated with the hydrogen generation efficiencies. Conduction band electrons in 2.8 nm CdS QDs transfer to the attached Pt sites in an average timescale of ∼30 ps, reflecting a transfer rate of 2.9 × 1010 s−1, which is more than two orders of magnitude faster than in their 4.6 nm counterpart. We attribute this to a larger driving force for electron transfer in the smaller nanocrystals due to the quantum confinement induced increase in the energetic off-set increasing between the electronic states of the semiconductor with respect to the co-catalyst. In the presence of an electron acceptor (e.g. MV2+ or H+) in solution, this size-dependent charge carrier dynamics still holds, which is utilised for photocatalytic water splitting. An acceleration of charge transfer rates with smaller nanocrystal size is directly correlated with the higher quantum efficiencies for H2 generation. All results provide more quantitative insight and guidance for the design of improved systems.
Experimental details
Synthesis of Pt-decorated CdS QDs
Pt–CdS hybrids were prepared in multiple steps as follows: (1) CdS QD synthesis, following the method of Yu and Peng.38 Typically, an 18 g N2 protected mixture of CdO (0.0576 g), oleic acid (0.382–3.82 g), and octadecene (90%, technological grade) was heated to 300 °C until the solution became clear and colourless. A solution of sulphur (7.2 mg) dissolved in octadecene (9.0 g) was swiftly injected and the system was cooled down to 250 °C for nanocrystal growth. The size of the CdS QDs was controlled by the concentration of oleic acid and crystal growth time, and monitored using UV-Vis absorbance29 (Shimadzu SolidSpec-3700DUV). Monodisperse samples were stored in chloroform.
(2) Water transfer of CdS QDs, following the method of Tamang et al.39 CdS QDs were then transferred to water by surface treatment with D,L-cysteine hydrochloride resulting in optically clear solutions with an optical density of 1.5 at the first excitonic absorption peak.
(3) Pt deposition onto CdS QDs, following previous procedures.15,16,25 Briefly, 10 mL of OD 1.5 stock solution of CdS QDs (pH 9), 0.15 mL 50 mM chloroplatinic acid hexahydrate, 65 mg ascorbic acid, 650 mg triethanolamine, and 10 mL H2O were mixed and argon protected in a beaker. UV excitation (ca. 3.5–4 mW cm−2 at 366 nm) from a standard UV lamp was applied for 20 min. The final samples of Pt–CdS hybrids were purified and re-dissolved in distilled water, giving a clear yellowish solution with a concentration of OD 0.6.
Photocatalyst characterization and transient absorption spectroscopy
The chemical composition of the samples was investigated using an Inductively Coupled Plasma-Optical Emission Spectrometer (Spectro Ciros ICP-OES). The morphology of the photocatalyst was characterized with a JEOL JEM-3010 TEM instrument operating at a 300 kV accelerating voltage. Samples for transient absorption measurements exhibited an optical density of 0.5 at their first excitonic absorption peak in a 2 mm cuvette (no visible aggregation observed during measurements in all aqueous solutions). Transient absorption measurements employed a commercial laser system (Light Conversion: Pharos ultrafast regenerative amplifier based on Yb:KGW lasing medium, Orpheus optical parametric amplifier, and Lyra second harmonic generation unit) producing 350 nm laser pulses (approximately 200 fs, 6 μW excitation above band edges) creating around 0.1 excitons per nanocrystal on average. In this region, recombination is expected to take place by first-order processes.40 Transient absorption spectra were subsequently acquired with a delayed, low-intensity continuum (360–480 nm) using a Helios spectrometer (HE-VIS-3200, Ultrafast Systems).
Photocatalytic reactions and quantum efficiency calculation
Detailed procedures are given in previous work.25 Briefly, hydrogen generation experiments were carried out in a 5 cm long (18.2 mL) cylindrical gas-tight quartz cuvette with two gas outputs, which is filled with 7 mL solution (containing 3.5 mL Pt/CdS, 0.02 M Na2SO3 and 0.05 M triethanolamine). Using the filtered output of a 450 W Xe lamp, the samples were excited under a beam with 1 cm2 excitation area, 50 mW cm−2 excitation power and a spectral range between 350 and 480 nm. Evolved gas samples were analysed using a gas chromatograph (Bruker-430-GC) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector. The internal quantum efficiency (IQE) for hydrogen generation (the ratio of photoelectrons consumed for hydrogen production to the number of photons absorbed by the solution) was evaluated with a thermal power sensor (Thorlabs S302C) and a spectrometer (Ocean Optics USB4000).

 	Fig. 3  (A) Schematic representation of the electron transfer rate related to the quantum confinement induced energetic off-set between the electronic states of the semiconductor with respect to the co-catalyst (adapted from ref. 25. The LUMO position of Pt is only intended as a guide to the eye as we assume a constant HOMO–LUMO-gap for the Pt clusters across the differently sized SNCs). (B) The dependence of H2 efficiency and electron transfer rates on the energetic off-sets between the QD conduction band edges and the LUMO position of the Pt clusters (the band gap data are shown on the x-axis since the exact values for the off-sets are not available).
