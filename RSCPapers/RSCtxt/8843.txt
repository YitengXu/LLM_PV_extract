1. Introduction
With the rapidly growing market in portable electronic devices, electric vehicles and hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), there has been an ever increasing demand for environmentally friendly, high-performance energy-storage systems. Supercapacitors, also known as electrochemical capacitors (ECs) or ultracapacitors, are such devices, with high power capability, long cyclic life (> 100000 cycles), low maintenance, and fast dynamics of charge propagation.1–4 With many thousands of times higher power density than lithium ion batteries and much larger energy density compared to conventional capacitors, supercapacitors are an ideal energy storage device offering advantages over other energy storage systems for applications requesting short load cycle and high reliability, such as energy capture sources, including load crane, forklifts, and electric vehicles.5 Nowadays, supercapacitors are used in consumer electronics, memory back-up systems, and industrial power and energy management.3 A more recent application of supercapacitors in Airbus A380 planes has shown their safe and reliable performance.
While the energy density of supercapacitors is much higher than conventional dielectric capacitors, it is still lower than batteries and fuel cells. Most of the commercially available supercapacitor products have a specific energy density less than 10 Wh kg−1, which is 3 to 15 times lower than batteries (150 Wh kg−1 is possible for lithium ion batteries).6 Thus, there has been a great deal of research effort on increasing the energy performance of supercapacitors to be close to or even beyond that of batteries.
A supercapacitor stores energy using either ion adsorption (electrical double layer capacitors, EDLCs) or fast and reversible Faradic reactions (pseudocapacitors). These two mechanisms can function simultaneously, depending on the nature of the electrode material. Progress towards supercapacitor technologies can benefit from the continuous development of nanostructured electrode materials. A number of recent reviews and books have discussed the scientific and technological aspects of supercapacitor devices and electrode materials.1,2,7–10 In the development of EDLCs, a proper control over the pore size and specific surface area of the electrode for an appropriate electrolyte solution is crucial to ensure a good performance of the supercapacitor in terms of both power delivery rate and energy storage capacity.11 To further enhance the specific capacitance of the electrode, the pseudo-capacitance that is due to the presence of foreign electro-active species on the electrode can be coupled with the electrical double layer capacitance. The capacitive performance of various carbon-based electrodes and the most commonly studied pseudo-capacitive materials in the literature are shown in Fig. 1.10
 Fig. 1  The capacitive performance for carbon and pseudocapacitor electrodes.10 
Activated carbons (ACs) are the most widely used electrode materials because of their large surface area, low cost and easy processability.12–14 However, as is seen from Fig. 1, the limited energy storage capacity (typically below 200 F g−1) and rate capability restrict their applications only to certain niche markets. Obviously, there are other important factors in dictating the selection of a good electrode material for supercapacitor applications, such as electrical conductivity, chemical and mechanical stability, and nanostructure. Table 1 summarizes some properties and characteristics of different carbon electrodes materials based on the literature. Graphene-based materials, including zero-dimensional (0D) fullerenes, one-dimensional (1D) carbon nanotubes (CNTs), two-dimensional (2D) graphene, and three-dimensional (3D) graphite, are of particular interest because of their exceptional electrical and mechanical properties and unique structures.15 Graphene, a 2D flat monolayer of sp2 hybridized carbon bonded in a hexagonal lattice, is the parent of all the graphitic carbons (Fig. 2).15–17 The 0D fullerene, 1D CNT, and 3D graphite or diamond can be formed by wrapping, rolling, and stacking of a graphene sheet, respectively.13

 Fig. 2  Graphene: the mother of all graphitic carbon materials.15 
While theoretical studies on graphene started some sixty years ago,25,26 it was only when free-standing graphene was first experimentally turned into a reality27 did it arouse a worldwide resurgence. With the confirmation of its unusual physical properties,28,29 applications of graphene as nanotransistors, radio-frequency devices, non-volatile memories, transparent electrodes for solar cells, liquid crystal displays, and supercapacitor electrodes have been widely exploited. In this feature article, we focus on recent research progress on graphene-based electrode materials for supercapacitor applications.
2. Supercapacitors: principle and performance
The mechanism by which a supercapacitor stores energy is, in principal, based on two types of capacitive behaviors: the electrical double layer (EDL) capacitance from pure electrostatic charge accumulation at the electrode-electrolyte interface and the pseudo-capacitance due to fast and reversible surface redox processes at characteristic potentials. The structure of the supercapacitor is similar to that of a battery. It consists of two electrodes in contact with an electrolyte solution separated by a separator (Fig. 3a). The components that make up the supercapacitor, including the electrodes, the separator, the current collector, as well as the electrolyte, all are important factors affecting the overall performance of the device that must be considered in designing a supercapacitor device. Porous carbon materials are often the choice of the electrode because of their good electrical conductivity coupled with large interface area. Fig. 3b illustrates an EDL structure (the Stern model) formed on a positively charged porous electrode surface without considering the curvature of the pore. The negative charge in both the Stern layer and diffuse layer all contribute to the EDL capacitance.
 Fig. 3  Schematic diagrams of (a) a two-cell supercapacitor device made of nonporous electrode and (b) the EDL structure based at a positively charged electrode surface. 
For the EDL type of supercapcitor, the specific capacitance C (F g−1) of each electrode is generally assumed to follow that of a parallel-plate capacitor:14 (1)where εr (a dimensionless constant) is the relative permittivity, ε0(F m−1) is the permittivity of a vacuum, A (m2 g−1) is the specific surface area of the electrode accessible to the electrolyte ions, and d (m) is the effective thickness of the EDL (also known as the Debye length). Different from the EDL capacitance, pseudo-capacitance arises for thermodynamic reasons between the extent of charge acceptance (Δq) and the change of potential (ΔV).7 The derivative C = d(Δq)/(d ΔV) corresponds to a capacitance, which is referred to as the pseudo-capacitance. The main difference between the pseudo-capacitance and the EDL capacitance lies in that pseudo-capacitance is Faradic in origin, involving fast and reversible redox reactions between the electrolyte and some electro-active species on the electrode surface. The most commonly known active species are ruthenium oxide,30 manganese oxide,31,32 vanadium nitride,33 electrically conducting polymers,34,35 and surface functional groups on carbon.36 While the pseudo-capacitance can be higher than EDL capacitance, it surfers from the drawbacks of a low power density and lack of stability during cycling.
The performance of a supercapacitor is mainly evaluated on the basis of the following criteria: (1) power density substantially greater than batteries with acceptably high energy densities (> 10 Wh kg−1), (2) an excellent cycle ability (more than 100 times of batteries), (3) fast charge-discharge processes (within seconds), (4) low self-discharging, (5) safe operation, and (6) low cost. It must be pointed out that the time constant expressed as resistance (R) times capacitance (C) is another important parameter in evaluating the performance of a supercapacitor. Therefore, in order to have smaller leakage or low self-discharging rate, a large time constant value is desirable.
The maximum energy stored and power delivered for a single cell supercapacitor are given in eqns (3) and (4), respectively: (3) (4)where V in volts is the cell voltage, CT in farads is the total capacitance of the cell, and Rs in ohms is the equivalent series resistance (ESR). Each of the elements is crucial to the final performance of the supercapacitor. The capacitance of the cell depends extensively upon the electrode material. The cell voltage is limited by the thermodynamic stability of the electrolyte solution. The ESR comes from various types of resistance associated with the intrinsic electronic properties of the electrode matrix and electrolyte solution, mass transfer resistance of the ions in the matrix, contact resistance between the current collector and the electrode. Hence, a high-performance supercapacitor must simultaneously satisfy the requirements of large capacitance value, high operating cell voltage, and minimum ESR. It is thus obvious that the development of both electrode material and the electrolyte solution are essential in order to optimize the overall performance of the supercapacitor.
With regard to the supercapacitor electrode, it must possess high surface area and proper pore size. In addition, the electrode should be electrically conductive with a good stability. The presence of pseudo-active species for enhancing the overall capacitance is sometimes necessary. Furthermore, the density of the electrode should be sufficiently high to give a high volumetric energy density, which is desirable for designing highly compact energy and power sources. On the other hand, the electrolyte must be carefully chosen and evaluated as well. Non-aqueous electrolytes with a low resistivity are a good choice for designing high-power and high-energy density supercapacitors because the non-aqueous electrolyte can be operated at high voltages (up to 3.5 to 4 V).
3. Graphene-based supercapacitor electrode materials
The honeycomb network of graphene is the basic building block of other important carbon allotropes with different dimensionalities, as shown in Fig. 2. Each of the allotropes exists as a different structure with different electrochemical properties. The performance of these graphene-based materials as supercapacitor electrodes is discussed separately in the following sections.
3.1 Graphite, carbon onions and fullerenes
Graphite has been known as a natural mineral for about 500 years and is widely used in our daily life, such as pencils and dry lubricants. Its high in-plane thermal conductivity and low electrical resistance make it a good candidate as an electrode material. Graphite is an anisotropic material with out-of-plane electrical and thermal conductivities 1000 times lower than the in-plane situation. In addition, graphite can be intercalated with other elements to produce graphite intercalation compounds (GICs).37 Furthermore, substitution of other elements, such as boron for carbon produces p-type graphite.38
Liu and Osaka39 described the EDLC behavior of isotropic, high-density graphite electrodes and polyethylene oxide/LiClO4 polymer electrolytes. The concentration and temperature of LiClO4 significantly affected the capacitance. Later, Mitra and Sampath40 made an advancement towards solid-state electrochemical capacitors by using exfoliated graphite (EG) as the electrode material. Specific capacitances ranging from 0.74 to 0.98 mF cm−2 with a long cycle life and a short response time were achieved. Expanding the interlayer spacing of graphite (d002 = 0.404 nm) was described by Ka and Oh.41 Ion-accessible sites were generated through ion intercalation into the interlayer space during the electrode polarization process. It was found that the volumetric specific capacitance could reach 30 F mL−1 and the cell voltage could be as high as 3.7 V with a charge-discharge columbic efficiency of over 99%.
The low electrolyte decomposition voltage limits the cell voltage of an EDLC device. On the other hand, the high operating voltages for lithium-ion battery devices are attributed to the formation of a protective layer on the electrode surface (the so-called solid electrolyte interphase, SEI) during the initial charge cycle, which can prevent further solvent reduction during subsequent cycling. Therefore, one possible route towards a high EDLC voltage may be the formation of a SEI-like protection layer on the EDLC electrode so the sustained solvent reduction can be prevented as well. Campana and co-workers42 investigated the intercalation of (C2H5)4N+ and passive film formation on a negative electrode made of highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG). Their results showed that the formation of a SEI-like protective layer can indeed allow the EDLC to be operated beyond 3 V, which is advantageous for improving energy storage capacity.
Recent development in asymmetric supercapacitors promises a wider operation window and higher energy density. Asymmetric supercapacitors using anodes and cathodes of different materials can overcome the limitation of symmetric supercapacitors by leveraging the different chemistries of the electrodes, thus achieving a wider cell voltage.43 Khomenko et al.44 described a hybrid supercapacitor with an organic electrolyte and graphite and activated carbon as the negative and positive electrodes, respectively. A voltage of 4.5 V was found to be the optimal voltage to achieve the highest energy density without capacitance fading during cycling. Park and co-workers45 developed a novel hybrid supercapacitor using graphite as the cathode and niobium(V) oxide as the anode to achieve high current load requirements. Recently, Tian and Lian43 discussed the high voltage window and excess capacitance observed on an asymmetric supercapacitor with graphite as the negative electrode and RuO2 as the positive electrode in H4SiW12O40 (SiWA) electrolyte.
Carbon onions, consisting of concentric graphene spherical shells, are high-surface-area (from 350 to 520 m2 g−1) graphitic carbon materials with few sub-nanometre pores. The completely accessible surface of carbon onions to electrolyte ions manifests them as good candidates for high-power supercapacitor applications. A study46 on their high current charge-discharge performance revealed a decrease of specific capacitance due to diamond particle graphitization and defect formation on particle surfaces. The carbon onion could deliver the stored energy under a high current density, since its capacitance was less dependent on current density. Capacitances of onion-like carbon materials ranging within 20–40 F g−1 in an acid electrolytic solution (1 M H2SO4) and 70–100 F g−1 in an alkaline electrolytic solution (6 M KOH) have been reported.47,48
Fullerenes and their derivatives are another promising family of carbon materials for supercapacitor applications due to their unique nanostructures, which combine reversible redox charge storage properties with high surface areas.17,49 The discovery of C60 in 198550 led to the 1996 Nobel prize award in Chemistry to Smalley, Curl and Kroto.51 Theoretical predictions indicated that the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of C60 is capable of accepting at least six electrons upon reduction. In addition to having high reversible redox charge capability, being chemically stable, uniformity in size and shapes, fullerenes and their derivatives have a large specific surface area (Table 2). The electrochemical properties of pure fullerenes and endohedral metallofullerenes are strongly dependent upon solute–solvent interactions.49,51 Tran and co-workers17 examined the dependence of size, shape and metal species (La) on the redox properties of C60, C70, and La@C82 in an ammonia solution containing 0.1 M potassium triflate (CF3SO3K). The relative magnitude of transfer coefficients that represent a measure of the symmetry of the energy barrier for the oxidation and reduction of the monoanionic species of the fullerenes suggested that the availability of the surface area permitting delocalization of π electrons is a determining factor of their reduction potentials. The lower reduction potential of La@C82 (about −0.72 V) than pure fullerenes C60 and C70 (about −0.96 V and −0.94 V, respectively) indicated that the former is a stronger electron acceptor. The rehybridization of C82 by the three electrons donated from the La atom makes it easier for La@C82 to accept an electron than other fullerenes.

Despite the superior electronic properties and charge carrier capabilities of graphite and fullerenes, these carbon materials are hardly used as supercapacitor electrodes, mainly due to their low specific capacitance. For graphite and exfoliated graphite, it is still unknown whether electrolyte ions can penetrate into the graphene layers, and how different the contributions of basal planes and edges to the total capacitance will be.48 Therefore, both theoretical and fundamental studies on the mechanism of charge storage in such materials should be carried out to advance supercapacitor development.
3.2 Carbon nanotubes and associated composites
The discovery of CNTs has significantly advanced the science of carbon materials. With their unique physical properties, such as high electrical conductivity and good chemical and mechanical stability, CNTs have proven their advantages in electrochemical energy conversion and storage.6,32,52–57 Both single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) have been explored as energy storage electrode materials.
Niu et al.58 observed that a MWNT-based supercapacitor electrodes with a specific surface area of 430 m2 g−1 displayed a specific capacitance of 102 F g−1 and a power density of 8 kW kg−1 in an acidic electrolyte. According to An and co-workers,59 SWCNT-based supercapacitor electrodes displayed a maximum specific capacitance of 180 F g−1 and a measured power density of 20 kW kg−1 at an energy density of 7 W kg−1 in KOH electrolyte. A recent study60 showed that the electrode fabricated with entangled CNTs was less efficient in facilitating ion transport than the electrode fabricated with aligned CNTs due to the irregular pore structures and high entanglement of the structure of the former. Hence, the use of aligned CNTs is advantageous in terms of high-power supercapacitors. Hata and co-workers54 described a method to fabricate a densely packed, aligned SWNT electrode by utilizing the zipping effect of liquids, which allowed the bulk materials to retain their intrinsic properties. The energy density of the aligned SWNT electrode was about 35 Wh kg−1 (normalized to a cell consisting of two identical electrodes) in an organic electrolyte. In addition, the rate capability was observed to be better than that of ACs.
Improvement of the energy density of CNT electrodes by increasing the specific surface area via KOH activation has been described.61 The porosity and electrical conductivity must be properly balanced in order to achieve both high capacitance and good rate performance. An interesting CNT-aerogel composite material was recently synthesized by uniformly dispersing carbon aerogel throughout the CNT host matrix without destroying the integrity or reducing the aspect ratio of the CNT.55The important features of the nanocomposite include large surface area, high mechanical resilience, lightweight matrix with pore spaces on micrometre scale, and binderless electrode. The specific capacitance was found to be 524 F g−1.
In spite their superior electrical properties, CNT-based supercapacitors do not meet the expected performance.59,62 One of the major issues is the high contact resistance between the electrode and the current collector, greatly limiting the power performance. Compared with binding electrode material to the current collectors indirectly, growing CNTs directly on to a conductive substrate is a promising approach to reducing the contact resistance. A template method for fabricating CNT/Au nanowire hybrid electrodes has been reported (Fig. 4).63 Both the electrode (CNT) and current collector (Au nanowire) are integrated into a single nanostructure, thus leading to a largely improved electrochemical performance with a power density as high as 48 kW kg−1.
 Fig. 4  A scheme showing a supercapacitor device with CNT/Au as the electrodes.63 
Another approach to enhancing the specific capacitance is to modify CNTs with active materials to realize pseudo-capacitance. Zhang and co-workers32 described the use of carbon nanotube arrays (CNTAs), which were directly connected with the current collector (a Ta foil) to make composite electrodes with a hierarchical porous structure. Manganese oxide,32 PANI,64,65 and polypyrrole (Ppy)66 were employed as the pseudo-active materials to prepare manganese oxide/CNTA, PANI/CNTA and Ppy/MWNT composites, respectively. The electrochemical results showed a very high specific capacitance of about 1000 F g−1 for the PANI/CNTA composite with an excellent rate capability (a 95% capacity retention at 118 A g−1) and a good stability (up to 5000 cycles test). The manganese oxide/CNTA composite possessed a moderate specific capacitance of about 100 F g−1 at a current density of 77 A g−1 with good cycle ability. The observed electrochemical performances of the composite electrode materials were ascribed to the direct growth of CNTA on the current collector and the pseudo-capacitive behavior of the active materials. In addition, the high density of the manganese oxide/CNTA composite material led to a high volumetric capacitance, suitable for compact supercapacitor design.
It is worthy to note that the pseudo-capacitance strongly depends on the surface utilization of the active material. Simon and Gogotsi9 suggested that one possible strategy to improve both the energy and power densities for supercapacitors is to achieve a conformal deposit of pseudo-capacitive materials onto highly ordered, high-surface-area CNT and AC electrodes.
3.3 Graphene, graphene oxide and associated composites
Since Geim and co-workers27 experimentally demonstrated the preparation of a single layer of graphite with atomic thickness, it has been gaining increasing interest in a wide range of fields.67 With inherent properties, such as tunable band gap, extraordinary electronic transport properties, excellent thermal conductivity, great mechanical strength, and large surface area, graphene has been explored for applications ranging from electronic devices to electrode materials.68,69

3.3.1 Synthesis of graphene and graphene oxide. 
Many methods have been reported to synthesize graphene sheets over the past few years, including mechanical cleavage of graphite,27 unzipping carbon nanotubes,70 chemical exfoliation of graphite,71 solvothermal synthesis,72 epitaxial growth on SiC surfaces73 and metal surfaces,74 chemical vapor deposition,75 bottom-up organic synthesis,76etc. Taghioskoui77 recently summarized various graphene preparation methods. One of the greatest challenges is the stabilization of single graphene sheets with controllable size and morphology. Fundamentals of chemistry and physics are especially important and preparation methods with or without polymeric and surfactant dispersants have been developed to prepare exfoliated graphene.78–80 Herein, we mainly focus on two methods, namely mechanical exfoliation that produces few layer graphene of high quality and a chemical method that has been demonstrated to give high throughput.
Mechanically exfoliated single-layer graphene was first developed by Geim and co-workers27 using a technique called micromechanical cleavage. Typically, a celluphene tape is used to peel off graphene layers from a graphite flake, followed by pressing the tape against a substrate. Upon removing the tape, a single sheet graphene is obtained. Ritter and Lyding81 utilized the mechanical exfoliation method to deposit graphene monolayers and bilayers with minimum lateral dimensions of 2–10 nm onto a H-passivated Si(100) surface. These earlier works provided opportunities to experimentally investigate the electronic structure of nanosized graphene and formed the foundation to develop graphene-based nanoelectronics. However, the low throughput of the mechanical exfoliation method largely limits its applications for mass production. Thereafter, alternative approaches affording a high yield are highly desirable.
On the other hand, the chemical method that is considered a scalable approach to synthesizing graphene, has been used widely to synthesize chemically derived graphene. As is schematically illustrated in Fig. 5, graphite is first oxidized to graphene oxide (GO) using either the Hummers method82 or the modified Hummers method.83 Chemically derived graphene can then be obtained after reduction of the GO using hydrazine solution or other reducing agents. GO is an excellent precursor to synthesize graphene nanosheets.80 The larger interlayer distance makes it readily dispersed in solution with a relatively high stability. Ruoff's group84 demonstrated a solution-based process for the production of chemically derived single-layer graphene with an excellent stability. A two-step method was recently reported for nearly complete reduction of surface functionalities of GO by deoxygenation with NaBH4 and dehydration with concentrated sulfuric acid.85 However, the harsh oxidation and reduction reactions may deteriorate the graphene structure and decrease the performance of graphene-based devices.
 Fig. 5  An illustration of the chemical route to the synthesis of chemically derived graphene.71 
Ang et al.86 proposed a straightforward one-step intercalation and exfoliation method to produce large-sized, conductive graphene sheets without the use of surfactants. The method is based on the rich intercalation chemistry of GO aggregates. The large-sized GO aggregates consist of multilayer graphene flakes, which are highly oxidized on the outer layer. The inner layer, on the other hand, consists of mildly oxidized graphene sheets. Intercalation of GO aggregates by tetrabutylammonium cations (TBA) via electrostatic attraction and cation-π interactions followed by exfoliation in DMF yields large-sized conductive graphene sheets with a high yield (> 90%).
Thin films are a useful morphology in many technological applications, particularly as electrodes in supercapacitors and batteries, fuel cells, and electronic devices. A flow-directed assembly method was recently described to produce GO paper-like materials.87 The chemical functional groups on the surface of the GO provide opportunities for tailoring the physical and chemical properties of the material. The preparation of macroscopic, free-standing GO membranes with controlled thickness and area at a liquid/air interface was demonstrated.88 Very recently, Yang and co-workers76 reported a chemical growth method for the synthesis of 2D graphene nanoribbons with lengths of up to 12 nm and the synthesis scheme is shown in Fig. 6.

3.3.2 Graphene as supercapacitor electrodes. 
Graphene is considered to be an excellent electrode material for supercapacitors because of its high electrical conductivity, high surface area, great flexibility, excellent mechanical properties, and rich chemistry. Graphene films have been used as stretchable electrodes.75 Chemically modified graphene (CMG) sheets can physically adjust themselves to be accessible to different types of electrolyte ions, free from the use of conductive fillers and binders. Besides, its flexibility facilitates an easy fabrication of supercapacitor devices. Ruoff and coworkers from UT-Austin pioneered the fundamentals of CMG materials.89
Studies have shown that the specific capacitances of graphene can reach 135 F g−1, 99 F g−1 and 75 F g−1 in aqueous, organic, and ionic liquid electrolytes, respectively.90,91 Despite the intense interest and continuous report on experimental observations, real applications of graphene have yet to be realized. This is mainly due to the difficulty in reliable production of high-quality graphene from a scalable approach.16 While mechanical exfoliation produces graphene with the highest quality, the method is neither high throughput nor high yield. Zhao et al.92 employed the chemical vapor deposition method to synthesize carbon nanosheets composed of graphene layers on conventional carbon fibers and carbon papers. It was found that such carbon nanosheets possess a capacitance value of 0.076 F cm−2 (based on the geometric testing area) in a H2SO4 solution. Hence, the total capacitance was estimated to be 1.49 × 104 F based on a virtual supercapacitor device rolled in a sandwich pad with a given dimension.
The experimentally observed capacitances are mainly limited by the agglomeration of graphene sheets and do not reflect the intrinsic capacitance of an individual graphene sheet. Very recently, an experimental determination of EDL capacitance (∼ 21 μF cm−2) and quantum capacitance of single layer and double-layer graphene were reported.93 In order to harness the unique properties of graphene, graphene- and GO-based composite materials have been explored.84,94 Ruoff and co-workers84 reported a general approach to preparing graphene-polymer composites via exfoliation of graphite and molecular-level dispersion of CMG sheets within polymers. A polystyrene-graphene composite was found to exhibit a percolation threshold of around 0.1 vol.% for room temperature conductivity, the lowest reported value for any carbon-based composite and almost the same as a SWNT-polymer composite. At only 1 vol.%, the composite displayed a conductivity of 0.1 S m−1, which is sufficient for many applications.
Graphene-conducting-polymer composites have received the greatest interest.95–98 Cheng and co-workers95 prepared a graphene/polyaniline composite paper (GPCP) by in situ anodic electropolymerization of aniline monomer as a PANI film on graphene paper. The obtained composite paper combines flexibility, conductivity and electrochemical activity and exhibited a gravimetric capacitance of 233 F g−1 and a volumetric capacitance of 135 F cm−3. A graphene nanosheet/polyaniline (GNS/PANI) composite was also synthesized using the polymerization method (see Fig. 7).97 Graphene (about 15 wt%) was homogeneously coated on the surface of PANI nanoparticles. A specific capacitance of 1046 F g−1 was observed at a low scan rate. The energy density of the composite could reach 39 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 70 kW kg−1.

Although graphene nanosheets are excellent electrode materials, the use of highly toxic reducing agents, such as hydrazine and dimethylhydrazine, remains a serious issue for large-scale production. Murugan and co-workers96 demonstrated a microwave-assisted solvothermal process to produce graphene nanosheets without the need for highly toxic chemicals. The authors investigated the energy storage properties of these thus-prepared graphene nanosheets and associated PANI composites. The graphene/PANI composite with 50 wt% graphene displayed both EDL capacitance and pseudocapacitance with an overall specific capacitance of 408 F g−1.
Very recently, we prepared a series of CMG and PANI nanofiber composites using an in situ polymerization method.99 PANI fibers were observed to adsorb on the graphene surface and/or filled between the graphene sheets. The composite displayed a specific capacitance as high as 480 F g−1 at a current density of 0.1 A g−1. The results showed that good capacitive performance can be obtained by doping either graphene with a small amount of PANI or bulky PANI with a small amount of graphene.

4. Summary
Graphene-based materials with various microtextures have proven to be promising electrode materials for supercapacitor applications. Despite the rapidly growing number of publications on the synthesis of graphene and GO, a cost-effective and environmentally benign method for the production of high quality, free-standing graphene still remains a great challenge. Control over both the quality and quantity of the final product in synthesizing graphene requires complete understanding of the physics and chemistry of graphene under different processing conditions. A number of critical issues, such as complete exfoliation of graphite, stabilization of single or few-layer graphene sheets in various solvents, and retaining the intrinsic properties of 2D graphene must be addressed before the chemical exfoliation method can be commercially used to produce graphene.
With the theoretical demonstration of pillared graphene for hydrogen storage100 and experimental results on porous graphene for gas separation,101 research breakthroughs are likely to be made in the near future with regard to nanoporous graphene for applications beyond gas storage and separation. With the well-established materials processing and growth techniques, such as the Langmuir-Blodgett method for producing thin films, the layer-by-layer technique for fabricating core-shell nanostructures, and self assembly under controlled colloidal chemistry, graphene-based architectures with designed physical, chemical and morphological properties as electrode materials for electrochemical energy storage and conversion will probably be one of the research trends.
Graphene-based composite materials with the intrinsic properties of graphene and pseudocapacitive materials, such as graphene-conducting-polymer composites and graphene-transition metal oxide composites, are promising supercapacitor electrodes. Future research efforts should be placed on enhancing the interactions between graphene and the pseudocapacitive material to improve the Faradic processes across the interface so as to achieve efficient pseudo-capacitance in addition to the EDL capacitance. Using conducting polymers and transition metal oxides to pillar graphene sheets is perhaps a good research direction towards utilizing the unique properties of graphene for supercapacitor applications.
In any case, colloidal science will play a vital role in realizing such envisioned structures and applications.
