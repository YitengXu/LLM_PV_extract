    , Accepted 16th April 2014First published on 17th April 2014AbstractA perovskite solar cell based on rutile TiO2 film was prepared and its photovoltaic performance was compared to an anatase TiO2-based perovskite solar cell. Rutile TiO2 nanoparticles with aspect ratio of 0.2 (20 nm wide and 100 nm long) were prepared by hydrolysis of TiCl4 at ambient temperature. Anatase TiO2 nanoparticles with diameter of about 50 nm were hydrothermally synthesized. The annealed rutile film showed porosity of 60.6%, while lower porosity of 49.1% was detected in the anatase TiO2 film. CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite was deposited on TiO2 film using either a one-step spin coating or two-step dipping method. 2,2′,7,7′-Tetrakis(N,N-p-dimethoxy-phenylamino)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-MeOTAD) was used as a hole transporting material. One-step deposition led to average power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 8.19% from the rutile-perovskite solar cells and 7.23% from the anatase-perovskite solar cells, while two-step deposition resulted in higher average PCE of 13.75% for the former device and 13.99% for the latter one. Regardless of the deposition methodologies, the rutile–perovskite solar cell showed generally higher Jsc and lower Voc. Slower electron transport and longer electron lifetime were observed for the rutile-based perovskite solar cell than for the anatase-based one. Although the same perovskite material was used for both rutile and anatase TiO2, the difference in electronic behavior indicates that photo-excited electrons are in part injected to TiO2 and the extent of electron injection can be influenced by the crystal phase of TiO2. Despite longer electron lifetime, the slightly lower voltage of the rutile-based device might be due to the fact that the amount of injected electrons was relatively larger for rutile than anatase, leading to a lower Fermi energy level at equilibrium between TiO2 and perovskite. Using a 260 nm-thick rutile TiO2 film, the highest PCE of 14.46% was achieved by depositing CH3NH3PbI3 using a two-step method, in which photocurrent density of 20.02 mA cm−2, open-circuit voltage of 1.022 V and fill factor of 0.71 were demonstrated.
Introduction
Perovskite solar cells based on an organolead halide light harvester have recently attracted much attention due to their superb photovoltaic performance and the extremely cheap technology required for their development. Methylammonium lead bromide and iodide were first attempted as sensitizers in dye-sensitized electrochemical junction structures in 2009, where CH3NH3PbBr3 showed a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 3.1% and CH3NH3PbI3 demonstrated higher PCE of 3.8%.1 Better performance from iodide perovskite was due to broader band absorption characteristics. Two years later, efficiency was almost doubled by optimizing the concentration of the CH3NH3PbI3 coating solution, the perovskite annealing temperature, and the electrolyte composition.2 In addition, the absorption coefficient of CH3NH3PbI3 measured from the thin TiO2 film whose surface was covered sparsely with CH3NH3PbI3 nanodots was one order of magnitude higher than that of ruthenium-based molecular dye (N719) obtained from the same thickness TiO2 film covered completely with N719. However, the perovskite light harvester easily dissolved in liquid electrolytes including polar solvents such as acetonitrile; thus, it could be studied further by researchers. This was eventually solved by replacing the liquid electrolyte with a solid hole conductor. An all-solid-state solar cell comprising the CH3NH3PbI3-depositied 0.6 μm-thick TiO2 film and the 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-p-dimethoxy-phenylamino)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-MeOTAD) hole conductor demonstrated a PCE as high as 9.7% along with excellent long-term stability.3
Electron injection from CH3NH3PbI3 to TiO2 was obvious in the solid-state perovskite solar cell3 because CH3NH3PbI3 nanodots were discontinuously adsorbed on the interconnected TiO2 nanoparticles. However, it was confirmed that the perovskite solar cell could work well even without a mesoporous TiO2 film, in which a thin continuous CH3NH3PbI2Cl layer formed on the Al2O3 surface showed a PCE of 10.9%.4 In this meso-superstructured perovskite solar cell, Al2O3 was used as a scaffold layer, and not for charge separation. This indicates that the perovskite can act not only as a light harvesting layer but also as an electron and/or hole transporting layer. Recently, long-range balanced electron and hole transport was proven and diffusion lengths of electron and hole were evaluated to be more than 1000 nm for CH3NH3PbI3−xClx (ref. 5) and ∼120 nm for CH3NH3PbI3.6 An attempt to use CH3NH3PbI3 as a light harvesting and hole transporting layer was made using the TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3/Au heterojunction structure.7 Therefore, the flexibility of the perovskite light harvester from a sensitizer to a charge transporter renders structural diversity. Instead of surface coating, a pillared structure by infiltration of CH3NH3PbI3 into mesoporous TiO2 film was proposed and demonstrated a PCE of 12%.8 Compared to the one-step coating method, the two-step coating procedure using an intercalation reaction of CH3NH3I in a two-dimensional layered PbI2 improved the perovskite quality and thereby PCE was enhanced up to 15%.9 By taking advantage of the charge transporting property of the perovskite material, a PCE of 15.4% was achieved from the planar p–n junction between the vacuum deposited CH3NH3PbI3−xClx and the solution processed spiro-MeOTAD.10 A PCE of 20% is expected from the perovskite solar cell,11,12 which indicates that organometal halide perovskite is a very promising solar cell material.
Extensive efforts have been made on perovskite solar cells over the past year in order to develop new cell structures or processing methods,13,14 to identify additives for improving hole transporting properties,15,16 to investigate the effects of anion exchange in perovskite and hole transporting materials,17–20 and to understand the opto-electronic properties of organolead halide and the working principles of the perovskite solar cell.21,22 In addition, the effects of nanostructures, such as nanorod,23,24 nanofiber25 and core–shell,26 and different oxide materials, such as ZnO27,28 and ZrO2,29,30 were investigated, in which electron transport and charge recombination were found to be dependent on oxide materials and nanostructures. From the comparative study between anatase TiO2 and ZrO2, open-circuit voltage (Voc) was lower for anatase TiO2 than for ZrO2, which could be explained by difference in charge separation pathway and the electron injection observed only in TiO2.29 Electron transport was observed to be faster in ZnO than in anatase TiO2 as a result of electron injection from CH3NH3PbI3 to the oxide conduction band.28 For the case of TiO2 and ZrO2 in the previous report,29 although electron transport occurred in different materials, i.e. TiO2 and CH3NH3PbI3, respectively, a small difference in electron transport kinetics was observed. It is therefore interesting to investigate the effect of the crystal phase of TiO2 on electronic behavior and photovoltaic performance.
Here, we report on the dependence of photovoltaic performance, electron transport and recombination on rutile TiO2 and anatase TiO2 in a perovskite solar cell. Two diverse methodologies for the perovskite deposition are applied for comparative study. The effects of phase and particle morphology of TiO2 on the perovskite layer are investigated. Electron transport and recombination kinetics are compared using transient photocurrent–voltage measurements. Notably, a two-step deposition of CH3NH3PbI3 in rutile TiO2 film results in a power conversion efficiency of 14.46%.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1 shows X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns for the hydrothermally synthesized nanocrystalline TiO2 using titanium isopropoxide and the TiO2 nanoparticle prepared by hydrolysis of TiCl4 at ambient temperature. All the XRD peaks are indexed to be anatase phase for the hydrothermal treated TiO2 and to be rutile phase for the TiCl4 hydrolyzed TiO2. The XRD peaks of the rutile TiO2 are broader that those of the anatase TiO2, which indicates that the rutile TiO2 is expected to be smaller than the anatase TiO2.
 Fig. 1  X-ray diffraction patterns of (a) hydrothermally synthesized TiO2 and (b) TiO2 formed from hydrolysis of TiCl4. Power samples annealed at 550 °C for 1 h were used for the measurement. All peaks in (a) and (b) were indexed to anatase (JCPDS#21-1272) and rutile (JCPDS#21-1276), respectively. 
SEM images clearly distinguish the morphology of anatase and rutile TiO2 as can be seen in Fig. 2. Anatase TiO2 shows spherical shape with average diameter of about 50 nm, whereas rutile TiO2 has rod-like morphology with an aspect ratio of about 0.2 (20 nm wide and 100 nm long). Rutile nanoparticles preferentially grow along the (001) direction, which leads to a large aspect ratio over five.31 In the case of the anatase nanoparticle, its equilibrium shape is bipyramidal due to preferential growth along the (101) and (001) direction.32 Note that BET data are listed in Table 1, and the BET measurement confirms that the surface area is slightly higher for the rutile TiO2 than for the anatase TiO2. The pore volume of the rutile TiO2 film is 0.36 cm3 g−1, which is higher than that of the anatase TiO2 film (0.25 cm3 g−1), which leads to a higher porosity of 60.6% in the rutile TiO2 film. The pore size of the anatase TiO2 film (42.66 nm) is slightly larger than that of the rutile TiO2 film (39.56 nm), which is confirmed by analysis of the SEM image (Fig. S1†).

Fig. 3 compares the morphology of the deposited CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite. One-step spin coating at 4000 rpm for 20 s leads to the perovskite capping layer. Deposition of CH3NH3PbI3 on the porous anatase TiO2 film results in a capping layer with rod-shaped crystals. Moreover, the perovskite is not completely infiltrated into the anatase TiO2 film. In contrast, a smooth perovskite capping layer forms on the rutile TiO2 film with better infiltration of the perovskite in the film. AFM images confirm that deposition of the perovskite on the rutile TiO2 film leads to a relatively smooth surface compared to the deposition on the anatase TiO2 film.

Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images for the surface of the CH3NH3PbI3 layer on (c) anatase and (d) rutile film. SEM and AFM images (within the dotted line) clearly show that the surface morphology and roughness of the perovskite CH3NH3PbI3 layer depend strongly on the TiO2 crystal phase and particle morphology. 
The surface morphology of the perovskite capping layer is found to affect the morphologies of the HTM overlayer and the Au overlayer as shown in Fig. 4. The perovskite solar cell based on the rutile TiO2 film shows a smooth Au surface, whereas the Au layer has a bumpy surface in the anatase TiO2-based perovskite solar cell.

Fig. 5(a) shows current–voltage curves for the one-step deposited perovskite solar cells. The anatase TiO2-based cell exhibits photocurrent density (Jsc) of 16.29 mA cm−2, Voc of 854 mV, and fill factor (FF) of 0.62, which leads to a PCE of 8.65%. Although a higher Jsc of 17.12 mA cm−2 and FF of 0.65 are obtained, a lower Voc of 806 mV is observed for the rutile-based perovskite solar cell. As a result, a PCE of 9.02% is observed in the rutile-based cell. The higher Jsc for the rutile-based perovskite solar cell is due to the higher EQE over the measured wavelength (Fig. 5(b)). Except for the difference in EQE intensity, the spectral features are almost identical regardless of the TiO2 crystal phase. Although we confirm the accuracy of our EQE measurements using a N719 dye-sensitized solar cell (Fig. S2†), perovskite deposited by the one-step method shows a significant discrepancy between the Jsc obtained from J–V curve and the Jsc calculated based on EQE data. However, in the case of perovskite prepared by the two-step method, the difference is only 9.1% (see Fig. 12) or even negligible (see Fig. 9). The extent of the discrepancy might be due to the difference in perovskite morphologies and/or interfacial contacts (TiO2/perovskite and/or perovskite/spiro-MeOTAD) formed by different coating methods.

In order to confirm the reproducibility, photovoltaic parameters are compared using histograms obtained from 48 cells (Fig. 6). Average Jsc of 16.12 mA cm−2 for the rutile TiO2-based devices is slightly higher than that of 15.71 mA cm−2 for the anatase TiO2-based devices. It is obvious that Voc is lower for the rutile devices (average Voc = 785 mV) than for the anatase devices (average Voc = 824 mV). The rutile-based device shows an average FF of 0.65, which is higher than the anatase based device, with an average FF of 0.55, which is related to the better surface morphology and better infiltration of the deposited perovskite for the rutile TiO2 film as observed in the SEM and AFM images. An average PCE of 8.19% is observed in the rutile-based devices, which is 13.3% higher than the anatase-based devices, with an average PCE of 7.23%. Moreover, the data obtained from the rutile-based devices shows a low standard deviation (6.79%) compared to the anatase-based devices (17.23%), which indicates that reproducible photovoltaic performance can be obtained when preparing the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite solar cell based on the rutile TiO2 film.

To investigate the electron transport and recombination behavior between the anatase- and rutile-based perovskite solar cells, transient photocurrent and voltage are measured. Fig. 7 shows electron diffusion coefficients (De) and time constants for electron recombination (τR). Compared to the anatase-based perovskite solar cell, De is almost one order of magnitude lower but τR is ten times higher for the rutile-based perovskite solar cell. If electron transport occurs in the perovskite layer without injection to the oxide layer, De is expected to be similar irrespective of the crystal phase of TiO2. The difference in De is thus indicative of indirect evidence of electron injection and a difference in electron pathway as well. The observed De ranging 10−6 to 10−5 cm2 s−1 for the anatase-based perovskite solar cell is in good agreement with the De of 6 × 10−5 cm2 s−1 observed from anatase TiO2 sensitized with N719,34 which indicates that the measured De is responsible for electron transport in TiO2. In addition, the De of the rutile TiO2-based perovskite solar cell shows an order of magnitude lower than that of the anatase-based one as shown in Fig. 7(a), which is consistent with the tendency observed in N719 dye-sensitized solar cells.34 Slower electron transport in the rutile TiO2 film is related to the extent of interparticle connectivity per unit film volume, associated with porosity.35–37 Since more open rod-like morphology results in high porosity in the rutile TiO2 film (60.6% vs. 49.1% for rutile film vs. anatase film), electron transport is expected to be slow in such an open porous network, associated with percolation theory.37 Slow electron transport kinetics is also monitored by time-limited current collection in EQE measurement (Fig. 8). Compared to the anatase-based perovskite solar cell, electron recombination becomes slower in the rutile TiO2-based perovskite solar cell, which suggests that more electrons are probably injected from the perovskite layer to the rutile TiO2. If electron–hole pairs are not effectively separated in the perovskite layer, recombination probability will increase, which may induce faster electron recombination. Based on this assumption, the relatively longer time for recombination in the rutile-based solar cell suggests that more electrons are injected from the perovskite to the rutile TiO2 layer. In addition, the lower Voc for the rutile-based device is also related to the extent of the injected electrons. Since the conduction band edge of TiO2 is lower than that of the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite,3,6 an increase in the amount of the injected electrons will decrease Voc due to the lowered Fermi energy level at equilibrium. The observed time constants for recombination in Fig. 7(b) are related to recombination characteristics of electrons in TiO2. When considering that diffusion length (Ln) corresponds to the square root of De × τR, τR is equal to Ln2/De. If we consider Ln = 130 nm and De = 0.036 cm2 s−1 for CH3NH3PbI3,6τR can be estimated to be as short as around 5 × 10−9 s. However, if we take Ln = ∼50 μm (ref. 38) and De = 6 × 10−5 cm2 s−1 (ref. 34) for TiO2 in electrochemical dye-sensitized solar cell, τR is estimated to be around 0.4 s. Thus, despite the longer electron lifetime, lower Voc indicates that more electrons are expected to be injected to rutile TiO2 compared to anatase TiO2.

 Fig. 8  Time-limited current collection measured from EQE setup at a frequency of 10 Hz. 
The photovoltaic performance of the two-step deposited perovskite solar cells is also compared. In Fig. 9, a similar tendency in photovoltaic properties is observed from two-step deposition. The average Jsc of 18.69 mA cm−2 for the rutile TiO2-based devices is slightly higher than that of 17.91 mA cm−2 for the anatase-based devices. The inset of Fig. 9(a) shows the EQE spectra of the two-step deposited perovskite solar cells, in which EQE-based Jsc is calculated to be 18.49 mA cm−2 for rutile and 17.33 mA cm−2 for anatase. The calculated Jsc values are in good agreement with the measured Jsc values. It is evident that Voc is lower for the rutile devices (average Voc = 1025 mV) than for the anatase devices (average Voc = 1050 mV). The rutile-based device shows an average FF of 0.72, which is slightly lower than the anatase-based device, with an average FF of 0.74. Lower Voc and FF result in slightly lower average PCE of 13.75% compared to that of the anatase-based devices (13.99%) despite higher Jsc. The different tendency in FF in comparison with the one-step method is probably related to the different morphology of perovskite and/or interfacial contact formed by the two-step method (see Fig. S3†). De and τR show a similar tendency between the one-step and two-step coating methods, which indicates that basic electronic behavior seems to hardly depend on the coating method.

Perovskite was formed by the two-step deposition method. The inset in (a) shows EQE spectra. τ1 and τ2 in (d) are the recombination time constants for electrons in TiO2 and perovskite, respectively. 
To investigate the presumably double electron transport paths in TiO2 and perovskite,39 we have tried to fit a photovoltage decay curve using a double exponential function and compared it with the fit result obtained by a single exponential decay function (Fig. S4†). The photovoltage decay curve can be fit with a double exponential function. The coefficient of determination, denoted as R-squared, is slightly higher for the fit with a double exponential function (R2 = 90.13%) than for the fit with a single exponential function (R2 = 88.96%), which indicates that there are potentially double electron transport paths. The results of the double exponential fit are depicted in Fig. 9(d). Two constants, τ1 and τ2, can be extracted, where τ1 is slower than τ2. Since there is little difference in τ2 between rutile and anatase, τ2 can be assigned to time constant for charge recombination in the perovskite. Fast recombination kinetics from the perovskite was previously anticipated based on ref. 6; thus, τ1 can be assigned to time constant for charge recombination in TiO2. Longer electron lifetime in rutile TiO2 is as consequence of more electrons being transferred from the perovskite to the rutile TiO2 compared to the anatase TiO2.
The Voc of the perovskite deposited using the two-step method is substantially higher than that of the perovskite deposited by the one-step method. The two diverse methodologies induce different layer structures as can be seen in Fig. S3,† in which the two-step deposited perovskite is almost perfectly infiltrated into the porous TiO2 network and thereby very uniform capping layer of the perovskite is formed. This structural modification is likely to separate the two n-type TiO2 layer and p-type hole transporting layer. Moreover, submicrometer-sized CH3NH3PbI3 crystals formed by the two-step method might also lead to better electron and hole transport and suppression of charge recombination, which are responsible for higher Voc in the two-step deposition method compared to the one-step procedure.
Because the deposited perovskite seems to adopt the reciprocal meso-superstructure of the underlying TiO2, it cannot be ruled out that the difference found between De in Fig. 7(a) could be due to the different morphologies of the perovskite layer templated by the underlying TiO2 scaffold; thus, to clarify this point, we have carried out further experiments. Although it is difficult to control the shape of the pore, the pore size can be easily controlled; thus, anatase nanoparticle films with different pore sizes are prepared by varying the EC/TiO2 ratio in TiO2 paste from 0.48 (small pore) to 0.72 (large pore, see Fig. S5†), in which EC (ethyl cellulose) is the pore-building reagent to induce different morphologies of the perovskite formed within the pores of TiO2 (perovskite was deposited by the two-step method for this study). As shown in Fig. 10, the perovskite solar cell based on EC/TiO2 = 0.48 shows a Jsc of 17.91 ± 0.62 mA cm−2, Voc of 1.050 ± 0.010 V, FF of 0.74 ± 0.02, which leads to a PCE of 13.99% ± 0.047%; however, the device based on EC/TiO2 = 0.72 exhibits Jsc of 18.08 ± 0.51 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.98 ± 0.011 V, FF of 0.70 ± 0.02 and PCE of 12.36% ± 0.047%. The lower PCE for the TiO2 film with larger pores is mainly due to lower FF and Voc. A difference in De is observed as shown in Fig. 7(b), in which the EC/TiO2 = 0.72 film shows lower De than the EC/TiO2 = 0.48 film. If we assume that electrons are carried exclusively within the perovskite, the difference in De could be attributed to the different perovskite morphologies formed by different pore size of anatase TiO2 films. However, in this case, the perovskite formed in the large pores would have a higher De because of the bigger grains as reported on the perovskite grain size-charge transport relation.40 Thus, as observed in a previous report,36De is related to electron injection in TiO2 and the lower De from EC/TiO2 = 0.72 sample is probably attributed to the lower interparticle connectivity of TiO2 due to the increased porosity. Moreover, if the electron injection in TiO2 occurs, the porosity of the TiO2 film can affect the electron injection because it occurs at the perovskite/TiO2 interface. Compared to the difference in Voc in the J–V curves, the change in τR is negligible. As described previously, since the extent of electron injection is relatively small for anatase compared to rutile, the porosity change in the anatase film is thus expected to have little effect on τR.

The perovskite was formed by the two-step deposition method. 
Based on the transient photocurrent–voltage study, we propose here that electron injection from the perovskite to TiO2 layer occurs partially and more photo-excited electrons would be injected in the rutile TiO2 layer than the anatase TiO2 layer, whereas non-injected electrons are expected to be transported in the perovskite layer. The electron pathway together with the extent of electron injection in the oxide layer are schematically presented in Fig. 11.
 Fig. 11  Schematic illustration of electronic behavior in the anatase TiO2-based perovskite solar cell and the rutile TiO2-based one. More electrons injected to rutile TiO2 also lowered the Fermi energy level at equilibrium between EF(TiO2) and EF(CH3NH3PbI3), leading to a lower Voc. 
Further improvements in the photovoltaic performance of the rutile TiO2-based CH3NH3PbI3 solar cell have been achieved by controlling the mesoporous rutile TiO2 layer thickness and using the two-step deposition method, in which the thickness of the compact- and mesoporous-TiO2 layers were adjusted to ca. 40 nm and 260 nm, respectively. A cross-sectional SEM image of the device is shown in Fig. 12(a). This structure exhibits a PCE of 14.46% with a Jsc of 20.02 mA cm−2, Voc of 1.022 V and FF of 0.71 (Fig. 12(b)). The integrated Jsc estimated from the EQE data is 18.20 mA cm−2, which is consistent with the measured Jsc, with a maximum EQE of 83.54% at 480 nm (Fig. 12(c)).

Conclusion
From the results obtained in this study, we draw the following conclusions. In terms of infiltration of the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite and the smooth surface of the perovskite capping layer, the rod-like rutile TiO2 film was found to be better than the anatase TiO2 film. At the given fabrication condition and with data obtained from 48 devices, the rutile TiO2-based perovskite solar cell exhibited better photovoltaic performance than the anatase TiO2-based devices, along with lower standard deviation. Photo-excited electrons generated in the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite were considered to be in part injected to the oxide layer, in which the rutile TiO2 layer accepted electrons to a larger extent. The lower Voc despite longer time for recombination for the rutile-based device could be explained by the lower conduction band position of the rutile TiO2 than that of the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite. From the comparative study on perovskite solar cells with different phases of anatase and rutile, we propose here that the crystal phase and morphology of oxide layer are critical to the photovoltaic performance of the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite solar cell.
Methods
Material synthesis

Anatase TiO2 nanoparticles. 
Nanocrystalline anatase TiO2 particles with average diameter of around 50 nm were hydrothermally synthesized using seed nanoparticles with a diameter of about 20 nm. The seed nanocrystalline TiO2 particles were hydrothermally synthesized using titanium(IV) isopropoxide (Aldrich, 97%) at 230 °C for 12 h.41 The synthesized seed colloidal particles were washed with ethanol using a centrifuge, which was redispersed in deionized (DI) water. Typically, 393.3 mL of 0.1 wt% seed TiO2-containing aqueous solution was placed in a 1000 mL round-bottom flask, to which 60 mL of titanium(IV) isopropoxide mixed with 15 mL of 2-propanol was added dropwise at 0 °C with vigorous stirring. The resulting solution was then stirred at 90 °C for 4 h, which was then transferred to a non-stirred high pressure titanium vessel and heated at 230 °C for 12 h. The synthesized 50 nm-sized anatase TiO2 nanoparticles were washed with ethanol using a centrifuge.


Rutile TiO2 nanoparticles. 
Nanocrystalline rutile TiO2 was synthesized by hydrolysis of TiCl4 (Aldrich, >98%) at ambient condition.35 A round-bottom flask containing DI water was placed in an ice bath, in which TiCl4 was added to obtain the final concentration of 2 M. The stock 2 M solution was diluted to 0.5 M, which was hydrolyzed for 5 days in air. Rutile TiO2 nanoparticles with an aspect ratio of about 0.2 (100 nm width × 20 nm height) were collected by removing water using a rotary evaporator. The collected nanoparticles were washed with ethanol using a centrifuge.


TiO2 pastes. 
TiO2 pastes were prepared by mixing anatase or rutile TiO2 nanoparticles, terpineol (Aldrich, 99.5%), ethyl cellulose (Aldrich, 46 cP) and lauric acid (Fluka, 96%) with nominal composition of 1.25 (1 for rutile TiO2): 6:0.6:0.1 in ethanol. The mixture was stirred for 30 min, and then ethanol was removed by rotary evaporator. The resulting pastes were further treated with three-roll-mill for 1 h to disperse the TiO2 nanoparticles well.


Methylammonium iodide (CH3NH3I). 
CH3NH3I was synthesized by reaction of 27.8 mL of CH3NH2 (TCI, 40 wt% in methanol) with 30 mL of HI (Aldrich, 57 wt% in water) in a round-bottom flask with vigorous stirring for 2 h in an ice bath.2,3 CH3NH3I was collected by evaporating the solvent at 60 °C for 2 h and washing five times with diethyl ether. The filtered white CH3NH3I powder was dried in vacuum before use.


Solar cell fabrication. 
Fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass (Pilkington, TEC-8, 8 Ω sq−1) was cleaned with 2% detergent solution in DI water and ethanol, which was followed by UV/ozone treatment for 15 min. A compact TiO2 layer was deposited on the cleaned FTO glass by spin-coating of 0.15 M and 0.3 M titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) (Aldrich, 75 wt% in isopropanol) in 1-butanol (Aldrich, 99.8%). Mesoporous anatase or rutile TiO2 films were formed on the compact TiO2 layer by spin-coating the TiO2 paste and annealing at 550 °C for 1 h. The annealed mesoporous TiO2 films were post-treated with TiCl4 by dipping in aqueous 20 mM TiCl4 (Aldrich, >98%) solution at 70 °C for 10 min and then annealing at 500 °C for 30 min. A precursor solution for CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite was prepared by dissolving 2.4 mmol of CH3NH3I and 2.4 mmol of PbI2 (Aldrich, 99%) in 2 mL N,N-dimethylacetamide (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.8%) at 60 °C overnight. CH3NH3PbI3 formed in situ in the porous TiO2 layer by spinning the precursor solution at a rate of 4000 rpm for 20 s and then drying at 100 °C for 15 min. This process led to a perovskite capping layer, on which 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-p-dimethoxy-phenylamino)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-MeOTAD) was spin-coated at a rate of 3000 rpm for 30 s, in which spiro-MeOTAD solution was prepared by adding 28.8 μL 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP) and 17.5 μL lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulphonyl)imide (LiTFSI) solution (520 mg LiTFSI in 1 mL acetonitrile) to 1 mL chlorobenzene solution containing 72.3 mg spiro-MeOTAD.9 Finally, 60 nm-thick Au was thermally evaporated on the spin-coated spiro-MeOTAD. CH3NH3PbI3 was also deposited using a modified two-step method reported elsewhere.9 PbI2 (20 μL; 1 M) in DMF solution was spin-coated on the mesoporous TiO2 layer, which was dried consecutively at 40 °C for 3 min and 100 °C for 10 min. The PbI2-coated electrode was immersed in 2-propanol solution of CH3NH3I for 1 min, which was followed by spinning and then drying at 40 °C for 3 min and 100 °C for 10 min. The spiro-MeOTAD solution was spun on top of the perovskite capping layer before thermal evaporation of Au.


Characterization of photovoltaic properties. 
Photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) characteristics were measured under AM 1.5G one sun illumination (100 mW cm−2) using a solar simulator (Oriel Sol 3A class AAA) equipped with a 450 W Xenon lamp (Newport 6279NS) and a Keithley 2400 source meter. The light intensity was adjusted by a NREL-calibrated Si solar cell having KG-2 filter. Each cell area in the device was about 0.180 cm2, which was covered with an aperture metal mask having an active area of 0.130 cm2 during the J–V measurement. External quantum efficiency (EQE) was measured using an EQE system (PV measurement Inc.). A monochromatic beam was generated by optical filter from a 75 W Xenon lamp (USHIO, Japan). EQE data acquisition was carried out in DC mode. Transient current response was recorded at different chopping speeds under a 550 nm monochromatic beam.42 Time constants for electron transport and recombination were measured with a weak laser pulse at 532 nm superimposed on a relatively large bias illumination at 680 nm using a transient photocurrent–voltage measurement setup described elsewhere.43


Material characterization. 
X-ray diffraction pattern was measured by Bruker AXS (D8 advance, Bruker Corporation) using Cu Kα radiation at a scan rate of 4° min−1. The pore volume (Vpore) and pore size (dpore) of the TiO2 films were measured by Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) analyzer (Micromeritics Instrument Corp. ASAP 2020), in which liquid N2 at 77 K was used as an adsorbate.44–46 Surface and cross sectional morphologies were investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JSM-7600F, JEOL).
