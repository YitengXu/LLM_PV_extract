    , Accepted 8th June 2017First published on 9th June 2017AbstractThe undesired charge recombination loss, occurring at photoanode/electrolyte interfaces, as well as the high redox potential of the currently used polysulfide redox couple electrolyte restrain the photovoltaic performance, particularly the open-circuit potential (Voc), of quantum dot sensitized solar cells (QDSCs). Herein, a valid and facile method to improve the performance of QDSCs is presented by modifying the polysulfide electrolyte with the addition of tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS). This approach is effective in a series of QDSC systems including the most commonly studied CdSe, CdSeTe, as well as Zn–Cu–In–Se (ZCISe) QDSCs. Experimental results indicate that with the use of 6 vol% TEOS additive in pristine polysulfide electrolyte at a staying time of 24 h, a remarkable enhancement in the conversion efficiency from 11.75% to 12.34% was obtained in ZCISe QDSCs. This photovoltaic performance is believed to be among the best result for all types of QD-based solar cells. The intrinsic mechanism for the performance improvement by the TEOS additive was verified by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and open-circuit voltage decay (OCVD) measurements.
1. Introduction
A high efficiency and low-cost photovoltaic technique has been regarded as a direct and effective approach in solving the crises of increasing environmental pollution and global warming.1,2 Among them, quantum dot sensitized solar cells (QDSCs) have been perceived as a promising alternative for the third generation of photovoltaic cells because of the outstanding advantages of quantum dot (QD) light absorbers, such as high extinction coefficient, tunable light absorption range, multiple exciton generation (MEG) possibility, and solution processability.3–7 Benefiting from the development of new sensitization methods as well as the design and adoption of new types of QD sensitizers with a light absorption range extending to the near infrared window,8–12 the short-circuit current (Jsc) of QDSCs has reached a satisfactory value. On the other hand, with the exploration of new catalytic materials (such as Cu2S, and mesoporous carbon) for counter electrodes, the fill factor (FF) of QDSCs has also enhanced remarkably.13–17 As a result, recent years have witnessed a rapid development of QDSCs with power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) increasing from less than 5% to over 12%.8,15,18–22 However, it is still an urgent task to improve the photovoltaic performance of QDSCs further and optimize device configuration to make it competitive to other types of emerging solar cells.23–31 Further boosting the performance of QDSCs needs the enhancement of photovoltage (Voc) via the adoption of new redox couple electrolytes or suppression of charge recombination processes.32–37
In QDSC devices, an electrolyte redox couple performs the function of charge transfer between the photoanode and the counter electrode as well as regeneration of oxidized QD sensitizers.38 The utilization of a polysulfide/sulfide (Sn2−/S2−) aqueous solution electrolyte for QDSCs enables fast scavenging of photoinduced holes and stabilization of chalcogenide QD light absorbers.39 As a result, efficient regeneration of the QD oxidized species can be realized, making circulatory cells viable. However, because of the undesirable high redox potential of Sn2−/S2− as well as the high overpotential for exciton separation and QD regeneration, the acquired highest open-circuit potential (Voc) has been limited to ∼0.65 V with the use of Cu2S/brass counter electrodes to date, which is far behind the theoretical expectation (the band gap of QD light absorber).40 New redox couple systems, such as I−/I3−, Co2+/3+ complexes and organic redox couples, have been tried for use in QDSCs,1,32–35 yet these tested redox couples have failed to achieve higher PCEs because of the incompatibility of QD in these electrolytes or the severe charge recombination presented. In order to get the desired high PCE, at present, it is wise to rely on the typical polysulfide electrolyte with modifications.
It is known that the charge recombination process is intrinsically severe in QDSCs with the use of polysulfide electrolytes.36,37 In addition to exploring new types of redox couples, the utilization of additives is another strategy to modify the electrochemical properties of the electrolytes. This strategy could be dated back to the early stages of DSCs.41–46 Related mechanisms and techniques have been well developed, and three beneficial effects could be anticipated: (1) tuning the potential of the redox couple used; (2) passivating the surface defect states of the metal oxide substrate by the absorption of additives, and thus retarding charge recombination processes; (3) shifting the conduction band edge of the metal oxide substrate.41,47 However, the modes that fit DSCs cannot be directly copied into QDSCs since the electrolytes are divergent in these two systems. The nitrile solvents used in DSCs are polar aprotic organic solvents, in which the nitrogen-containing additives (represented by heterocyclic compounds48,49 and guanidinium45) are stable and exist in a nearly “naked” state to exert a satisfactory nucleophilic ability, which favors them to be adsorbed on target sites and perform their functions. However, when it comes to aqueous polysulfide electrolyte systems, the nucleophilic ability of nitrogen-containing species is dramatically weakened in the presence of S2−, HS−, OH−, and water molecules. In addition, they are either unstable or faced with strong interaction with water molecules because of the strong basicity and the formation of hydrogen bonds. These are the sources for their invalid effects in protic aqueous electrolytes. This is also the reason that the application of additives in polysulfide electrolytes is rather limited. Recently, Zhong's group reported a modified polysulfide electrolyte with the addition of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)50 and poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP)51 to suppress the undesired charge recombination, and thus improve the Voc and PCE of QDSCs. The addition of sodium polyacrylate (PAAS-Na)52 and sodium carboxymethylcellulose (CMC-Na)53 led to the gelation of the electrolyte and expedited cell stability without degrading the solar cell performance. However, the effects of these discoveries are limited compared to the findings in DSCs. Therefore, it is still a great necessity to explore more potential additives in order to meet the requirements of an aqueous electrolyte system. Based on this, water-compatible inorganic compounds are naturally under consideration.
Recently, fumed SiO2 nanoparticles were reported to serve as an additive for a polysulfide electrolyte in the CdSeTe QDSC system by Meng's group.22 Investigations on the electron transport and recombination dynamics revealed that the SiO2 particles are capable of coating the surface of the photoanode, and acting as an energy barrier, and thus effectively suppressing the photo-generated electron recombination. The effect of the pre-prepared SiO2 particles should be much inferior to the two-dimensional amorphous SiO2 film to serve as a passivation barrier layer on the surface of the photoanode, which can be feasibly obtained via the hydrolysis condensation reaction from silica precursors such as tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS). Based on this consideration, an amendatory strategy has been introduced to modify the polysulfide electrolyte with the addition of TEOS. The experimental results show that this modification can significantly improve the photovoltaic performance, particularly in the aspect of Voc, and Jsc, for various QD materials (such as Zn–Cu–In–Se, CdSeTe, and CdSe) based QDSC systems. A remarkable enhancement of PCE from 11.75% to 12.34% was obtained in Zn–Cu–In–Se (ZCISe) QDSCs with the addition of 6 vol% TEOS in the polysulfide aqueous electrolyte system. To the best of our knowledge, this obtained PCE is among the best performances for quantum dot-based solar cells, and this strategy paves a facile new way to boost the performance of QDSCs further.
2. Experimental
Chemicals
All the chemicals used for the preparation of OAm-capped CdSe, CdSeTe, and ZCISe oil-soluble QDs were the same as reported in a previous study.8,10,19–21 3-Mercaptopropionic acid (MPA, 97%) and thioglycolic acid (TGA, 97%) were purchased from Alfa Aesar. Terpineol (AR), ethyl cellulose ([C6H7O2(OC2H5)3]n, AR), and ludox SM-30 sol (30 wt% SiO2) were obtained from Aldrich. Na2S·9H2O (98%), sulfur (99.5%), phenol (C6H6O, AR), formaldehyde (CH2O), KCl (99.5%) and tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Company. Hydrofluoric acid (HF, 40 wt%), sodium hydroxide (NaOH, AR), hydrochloric (HCl, AR) and paraffin liquid (chemical grade) were obtained from the Shanghai Chemical Reagents Company. All chemicals were used as received without further treatment.
Synthesis of QD light-harvesting materials
The investigated QD light-harvesting materials, including OAm-capped CdSe, CdSeTe, and ZCISe oil-soluble QDs, were synthesized and purified according to published literature methods.8,10,19–21 The MPA- and TGA-capped water-soluble QDs were obtained via a ligand exchange process with the use of MPA or TGA as the phase transfer reagent, as demonstrated in previous studies.8,54 The obtained QD aqueous dispersions could be used for the sensitization of TiO2 film electrodes to obtain photoanodes.
Immobilization of QDs onto TiO2 film electrodes and fabrication of solar cell devices
The configuration of TiO2 mesoporous film electrodes is identical to that in our previous study.8,54 QD sensitizers were immobilized on TiO2 mesoporous film electrodes by pipetting MPA or TGA-capped QD aqueous solution onto the film electrodes. After QD loading, the photoanodes were rinsed with water and ethanol sequentially. ZnS passivation layers were then coated on the QD-sensitized photoanodes by immersing the electrodes into a 0.1 M Zn(OAc)2 methanol solution and 0.1 M Na2S aqueous solution alternately. The number of SILAR cycles are 4 for CdSe and CdSeTe, and 6 for ZCISe based QDSCs.8,19–21 Sandwich-structured cells were constructed by assembling the photoanode with a Cu2S/brass counter electrode and filling with electrolyte. The electrolyte solution was prepared by adding a certain fraction of TEOS in the initial polysulfide electrolyte aqueous solution (containing 2.0 M of Na2S, 2.0 M of S, and 0.2 M of KCl) and kept for a certain period of intervals.
Characterization
Current–voltage (J–V) curves of the cell devices were measured using a Keithley 2400 source meter under illumination of simulated AM 1.5G solar light (Oriel, Model no. 94022A) with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2 (1 full sun). A NREL standard Si solar cell was used to calibrate the light intensity prior to each test. The photoactive area was defined as 0.235 cm2 by a black metal mask. The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectrum was obtained using a Keithley 2000 multimeter under the illumination by a spectral product DK240 monochromator with a 300 W tungsten lamp. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and open circuit voltage decay (OCVD) measurements were performed using an electrochemical workstation (Zahner, Zennium). EIS spectra were obtained under the dark condition at different forward biases ranging from 0.4 to 0.6 V, using a 20 mV AC sinusoidal signal over a constant applied bias with the frequency range of 1 MHz to 0.1 Hz. In the OCVD measurements, the device was illuminated by a white LED with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2 to a stable photovoltage value, and the dependence of photovoltage on time was subsequently recorded after switching off the light.
3. Results and discussion
Hydrolysis and condensation reaction of TEOS
In contrast to previous reports, where gelation occurred because of the addition of fumed silica,22 the introduction of TEOS (Si(OC2H5)4) in the electrolyte brought about no visible change within 24 h. It is supposed that the TEOS underwent OH−-catalyzed hydrolysis and condensation reactions to form amorphous silica in this alkaline polysulfide electrolyte media, while the reaction rate was rather slow based on our observation. With the addition of a large amount of methanol into the reaction system, a white precipitate containing Na2S and the formed silica could be observed. Washing with water could dissolve the water-soluble Na2S, but white silicate flocculates still remained. Note that the silica flocculate is soluble in strong alkaline media such as concentrated NaOH solution, but insoluble in water. Based on these observations, the following three reactions could be anticipated in the polysulfide electrolyte media with the addition of TEOS: Si(OC2H5)4 + 4H2O → Si(OH)4 + 4C2H5OH(1) nSi(OH)4 → (SiO2)n↓ + 2nH2O(2) (SiO2)n + 2nNaOH → nNa2SiO3 + nH2O(3)
As we know, the pH of the polysulfide aqueous solution is up to 10. It has been well established that under alkaline conditions, TEOS can be hydrolyzed into silicon hydroxide (Si(OH)4), and reaction (1) takes place. Then, insoluble amorphous silica ((SiO2)n) can be derived from the formed silicon hydroxide via the condensation reaction (2). The dissolution of silica to form sodium silicate (Na2SiO3) in a strong basic solution is represented in reaction (3). For the purpose of convenience, we refer to the insoluble hydrolysis condensation product (SiO2)n as silica. The formed silica, and not sodium silicate, is responsible for the alteration of cell performance. To confirm this assumption, a control experiment was designed. In this control experiment, it was found that the addition of sodium silicate in the polysulfide electrolyte did not influence the photovoltaic performance of the resultant cell devices (Fig. S1 and Table S1 (ESI†)). It is reasonable to suppose that the initial concentration and reaction time of TEOS in the polysulfide electrolyte solution determine the amount and polymerization degree of the formed silica. Since the photovoltaic performance of the resultant cells is dependent on the amount and polymerization degree of the silica formed in a polysulfide electrolyte, an optimal amount of TEOS and reaction time are required to get access to the optimal photovoltaic performance of the resultant cell devices. Therefore, the influence of the TEOS concentration and reaction time on the photovoltaic performance of the resultant QDSCs was investigated and optimized in the following study.
Photovoltaic performance
ZCISe-based QDSCs were adopted as a cell model to evaluate the influence of the TEOS additive in the polysulfide electrolyte because of the excellent photovoltaic performance reported for this type of a cell device.8,15 QDSC devices were fabricated according to standard literature methods by assembling the QD-sensitized photoanode and Cu2S/brass counter electrode. Redox couple electrolytes were derived from the classic polysulfide/sulfide electrolyte aqueous solution with the addition of various volumetric fractions of TEOS (0, 3, 6 and 9 vol%) and kept there for 24 h. Under each condition, five cells were prepared and tested in parallel to ensure the validity of the obtained results.
The photovoltaic performance of champion ZCISe QDSCs under standard measurement conditions corresponding to various TEOS additive concentrations in pristine polysulfide electrolyte are shown in Fig. 1a, and the extracted photovoltaic parameters (including PCE, FF, Voc, and Jsc) are given in Table 1. For clarity, the dependence of the individual photovoltaic parameter together with the corresponding deviation value of cell devices with different TEOS concentrations in the electrolyte are illustrated in Fig. 1b and c. The J–V curves and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters for the individual device under different conditions are given in Fig. S2 and Table S2 (ESI†). From these data, it is found that both the short-circuit Jsc and open-circuit voltage Voc values increased systematically with an increase in the TEOS concentration in a polysulfide electrolyte solution and approached the highest values when the TEOS concentration was 6 vol%. When the TEOS concentration was over 6 vol%, the Jsc and Voc values started to decrease gradually. In contrast, the fill factor FF value remained nearly constant over the entire TEOS concentration range investigated. In contrast to previous studies that used sodium polyacrylate (PAAS), sodium carboxymethylcellulose (CMC-Na), poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP), and polyethylene glycol (PEG) additives, where a negative effect on Jsc and a positive effect on FF were observed,50–53 herein, a positive effect on Jsc and a neutral effect on FF were observed in the TEOS additive. Note that in the report with the use of fumed SiO2 nanoparticles additive, enhanced FF and Voc were observed.22 Same as in previous studies,22,50–53 a positive effect on Voc was observed in this study. As a result, the obtained PCE value followed the same trend as those for Jsc and Voc, and the best result for the average PCE was 10.16% (Voc = 0.628 V, Jsc = 26.84 mA cm−2, FF = 0.603) and the highest PCE for a champion cell was 10.27% (Voc = 0.629 V, Jsc = 26.91 mA cm−2, FF = 0.607). These results show about a 10.7% improvement from those of the reference cells (PCE = 9.18%, Voc = 0.589 V, Jsc = 25.79 mA cm−2, FF = 0.605), corresponding to pristine polysulfide electrolyte in the absence of TEOS additive. It is highlighted that the observed photovoltaic performance of reference cells stayed at the same level as the best-reported result for ZCISe cells with a Cu2S/brass counter electrode. This means that the performance improvement through our adopted strategy is based on a previous highest record.

It is noted that the measured results for Jsc, as shown in Fig. 1c, are in accordance with the calculated results based on the IPCE (incident photon-to-electron efficiency) data shown in Fig. 1d, and the integrated current density value (26.8 mA cm−2) from the IPCE spectra is consistent with the value obtained from the J–V measurements. It has been established that the IPCE value is determined by a series of device parameters: IPCE = LHE × φinj × ηcc,55 where LHE is the light harvesting efficiency, φinj is the electron-injection efficiency, and ηcc is the charge-collection efficiency. Evidently, the presence of TEOS in the electrolyte could not alter LHE and had no effect on the QD/TiO2 interfaces, and accordingly, there was no impact on φinj. Therefore, the observed increased Jsc in the presence of TEOS should be ascribed to the enhanced ηcc. This assumption will be verified further by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy.
To test the applicability of the TEOS additive, in addition to ZCISe, CdSe and CdSeTe QDSCs were also fabricated according to a standard literature method,19–21 with the use of the modified polysulfide electrolyte containing 6 vol% TEOS additive, and the corresponding photovoltaic performances were measured. The corresponding photovoltaic parameters for CdSe and CdSeTe QDSCs based on a modified electrolyte are shown in Table 1. For clarity, the average PCE as well as the deviation for various QDSCs, corresponding to pristine and TEOS-modified electrolyte, are summarized in Fig. 1e. Detailed J–V curves and photovoltaic parameters for CdSe- and CdSeTe-based QDSCs are available in Fig. S3, 4 and Table S3, 4 (ESI†). For CdSe QDSCs, the average PCE can be improved by about 7.7% (increasing from 6.78% to 7.30%). A similar effect was also observed for CdSeTe QDSCs, with the PCE improving by 8.7% (increasing from 8.93% to 9.71%). Therefore, the introduction of TEOS in a pristine polysulfide electrolyte can exhibit positive effects on various QD sensitizer-based QDSCs, such as CdSe, CdSeTe, and ZCISe. This observed universality has also been found for PVP additives in a previous study,51 but failed for the PEG additive.53
To further optimize the effect of the TEOS additive in the polysulfide electrolyte on the performance of ZCISe QDSCs, the influence of staying time (0, 3, 12, 24 and 48 h) for the modified electrolyte with 6 vol% TEOS concentration was studied. The measured J–V curves for champion cells and the extracted average photovoltaic performances under each staying time are shown in Fig. 2 and Table 2 with their detailed information available in Table S5.† Furthermore, the dependence of the photovoltaic parameters on the staying time of the electrolyte is summarized in Fig. 2b and c. Similar to the concentration variable, Jsc, Voc, and PCE have a heavy dependence on the staying time. When the staying time was less than 24 h, these three photovoltaic parameters showed a positive correlation with the staying time, while a negative correlation was observed when the staying time was greater than 24 h. Same as the case of the concentration variable, the FF is nearly independent of the staying time. It could be concluded that the optimal staying time for the TEOS-modified electrolyte is 24 h, and any lack or delay in this staying time is unfavorable for the photovoltaic performance of the resultant cell devices.

It has been reported that QDSCs with a Ti mesh-supported mesoporous carbon (MC/Ti) counter electrode (CE) showed a better photovoltaic performance compared to those with a Cu2S/brass CE.16 In order to get better photovoltaic performances, we endeavored to apply the MC/Ti CE to construct ZCISe QDSC devices. Photovoltaic performances for the MC/Ti CE based ZCISe QDSCs, corresponding to pristine and 6 vol% TEOS modified polysulfide electrolyte, are shown in Fig. 3 and Table 3. It is found that in the case of MC/Ti CE, the adoption of 6 vol% TEOS-modified polysulfide electrolyte can improve the average PCE from 11.75% to 12.34% for the reference cell (Voc = 0.768 V, Jsc = 26.36 mA cm−2, FF = 0.610). To the best of our knowledge, this value is among the best results for all types of QD-based solar cells.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
To unravel the intrinsic mechanism of the effect of TEOS additive in the polysulfide electrolyte on the photovoltaic performance of QDSCs, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was used. This is because the EIS technique can distinguish the electrochemical features corresponding to different constituents of a cell device.56 EIS measurements were carried out under dark conditions with a forward bias ranging from −0.4 to −0.6 V by applying a 20 mV AC sinusoidal signal with a frequency range of 100 kHz to 0.1 Hz. EIS parameters were deduced from a standard simulation circuit. The applied bias (Vapp) dependent Cμ (chemical capacitance, which stands for the change of electron density as a function of Fermi level) and Rrec (the charge recombination resistance at the photoanode/electrolyte interfaces) were extracted from the corresponding Nyquist curves and are shown in Fig. 4.

Inset: the equivalent circuit for EIS measurement. 
It was found that with an increase in the TEOS concentration in the polysulfide electrolyte, the observed Cμ value remained nearly constant (Fig. 4a). This indicated that the presence of TEOS in the polysulfide electrolyte did not alter the conduction band edge or the density of the states of the TiO2 matrix. This result is consistent with previous reports.56,57 However, from Fig. 4b it can be observed that Rrec was enhanced with an increase in the concentration of TEOS. It is known that Rrec is inversely proportional to the charge recombination rate.56 The observed enhanced Rrec value indicated that the charge recombination dynamics occurring at the photoanode/electrolyte interfaces is suppressed with the introduction of TEOS additive in the polysulfide electrolyte. The suppressed charge recombination then increased the enhancement of Voc and Jsc, and therefore an improvement in the PCE of the resultant cell devices was also observed. This is consistent with the results observed in the J–V measurement (Fig. 1). It is noted that the device with 9 vol% TEOS, which showed the largest Rrec value among all the tested samples as shown in Fig. 4, exhibited poorer photovoltaic performance compared to that with a 6 vol% TEOS. This is mainly ascribed to the dramatically reduced ionic conductivity (σ) of the electrolyte containing 9% TEOS. As shown in Fig. S7 (ESI†), it can be seen that with the shift in the TEOS concentration from 6 vol% to 9 vol%, the corresponding σ value underwent a sharp reduction by 25% (from 68.3 to 51.1 mS cm−1). Since the electrolyte is responsible for the charge transport in QDSCs, the conductivity of the electrolyte would have an impact on the generation of electricity, and therefore on the photovoltaic performance of the cell devices. The poor ionic conductivity of the electrolyte with 9 vol% TEOS deteriorates the performance of the resultant devices. In the tradeoff between the Rrec and σ values, the electrolyte with 6 vol% TEOS showed the best performance.
The mechanism for the suppressed charge recombination at the photoanode interfaces can be explained as follows. As described above, TEOS molecules in the alkaline media of the polysulfide electrolyte aqueous solution underwent a hydrolysis condensation reaction, and amorphous silica was formed in situ. The formed silica would be feasibly adsorbed on the surface of the QD-sensitized photoanode because of the presence of terminal hydroxyl groups on silica. The covered silica layer could serve as an energetic barrier layer to separate the photogenerated electrons from the redox couple in the electrolyte, and therefore inhibit the charge recombination process, in which the photogenerated electrons were captured by the oxidized species (herein Sn2−) in the electrolyte. Further comparison of the Nyquist plots for solar cells based on a series of TEOS concentrations at a forward bias of −0.6 V close to the Voc value is illustrated in Fig. 4d. It is clearly seen that the diameter of the EIS semicircles increased systematically with an increase in the TEOS concentration in the electrolyte. This gives a direct evidence for the increased Rrec and the inhibited recombination process by the TEOS additive. Moreover, the dark current measurement results, shown in Fig. 4c, indicated that the dark current values of the cell devices corresponding to higher concentrations of TEOS in the electrolyte were all lower than those with less TEOS under the same applied bias condition. This finding supports further evidence for the claimed reduction of the charge recombination by the TEOS additive. Moreover, the electron lifetime τn defined by τn = Rrec × Cμ at the open-circuit condition also shows greater values for the cells with a higher concentration of TEOS in the electrolyte than those with less or absent TEOS.
Open-circuit voltage decay
Open-circuit voltage decay (OCVD) analysis was further applied to elucidate the charge recombination behavior.58 In a typical measurement, the cell was initially illuminated by a white LED with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2, followed by switching off the light after the cells had reached a steady stage and recording the temporal evolution of the open circuit voltage values. The OCVD results are shown in Fig. 5a, from which we could observe that the transient Voc values of the cells maintained at corresponding open circuit voltages under illumination started to decay according to the exponential formula under the dark condition. However, the decay rate decreased with an increase in the TEOS in the electrolyte. This could be intuitively understood by observing a gentler slope of the decay curves. The electron lifetime, τn, is obtained by the equation59τn = −(kBT/e)(dVoc/dt)−1, where kB is the Boltzmann constant, T is the absolute temperature (298 K), and e is the elementary charge quantity. The plot of τnversus Voc is shown in Fig. 5b. It can be found that the calculated electron lifetime (τn) at the same Voc value increases with the TEOS concentration. The dependence of τn values on the concentration of TEOS in the electrolyte for different cell devices is consistent with that of PCE on the TEOS concentration as discussed above. These results indicate that the effectiveness of the TEOS additive in the polysulfide electrolyte lies in inhibiting the charge recombination dynamics and accordingly improving the photovoltaic performance of the resultant cell devices.

Stability test
When it comes to discussing the topic of commercial application of solar cell devices, the stability issue remains a barrier. It is known that the volatilization and leakage of liquid electrolyte are among the main factors that restrict the long-term stability of liquid-junction solar cell devices. In our previous studies, the addition of PAAS-Na and CMC-Na led to the gelation of electrolyte, which could significantly expedite cell stability without degrading the solar cell performance.52,53 In Meng's investigation,22 better stability was obtained because of the gel structure after addition of the SiO2 particles. In our case, the introduction of TEOS failed to form a complete quasi-solid structure, while the reduced liquidity and volatility of the resultant electrolyte was perceptible due to the interaction of silica with water molecules, particularly at high TEOS concentration. Herein, the long-term stability of QDSCs based on TEOS modified polysulfide electrolyte was evaluated.60,61 For the stability test, the CdSe based QDSCs with and without 6 vol% TEOS in the electrolyte were sealed according to our previous studies.60 The sealed cells were stored under ambient dark condition and tested every 4 h. As shown in Fig. 6, the addition of TEOS in the electrolyte improved the stability of the cells. In the absence of TEOS, the PCE started to decline after 28 h and reached 84% of the initial value after 56 h. The observed degradation in the performance was mainly derived from a reduction of the Jsc. In contrast, cells with 6 vol% TEOS maintained the best performance for 44 h, retaining 94% of the initial efficiency after 76 h. We suppose that the promising improvement in the cell stability should be ascribed to both the protection of QD against corrosion due to the absorbed silica at the QD/electrolyte interfaces and retarded leakage of the electrolyte.

4. Conclusions
In summary, a feasible and convenient method was developed to improve the photovoltaic performance and stability of QDSCs by adding TEOS into the polysulfide electrolyte. Moreover, this TEOS additive in the electrolyte can benefit the performance improvement of various QDSCs based on commonly used QD sensitizer materials such as CdSe and CdSeTe as well as ZCISe QDs. Both EIS and OCVD measurements indicated that the charge recombination at the photoanode/electrolyte interfaces was significantly suppressed with the increase in the TEOS concentration in a pristine polysulfide electrolyte solution. The average PCE of ZCISe-based QDSCs was boosted to a new record of 12.3% under standard measurement conditions with 6 vol% TEOS in the polysulfide electrolyte at a staying time of 24 h. This study paves the way for a simple and feasible method to further improve the performance of QDSCs.
