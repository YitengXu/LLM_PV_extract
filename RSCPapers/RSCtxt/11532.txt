    , Accepted 23rd June 2021First published on 23rd June 2021AbstractPoly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) is combined with a series of C60-based derivatives with LUMO energies varying between −3.53 and −3.83 eV, in order to study the influence of the fullerene LUMO level on the performance and stability of organic solar cells as well as the degradation of the photoactive materials. UV/vis measurements show that P3HT degrades more slowly in all investigated P3HT:fullerene blends compared to neat P3HT films when being irradiated in air. Accordingly, all fullerene derivatives stabilize P3HT against photo-oxidation, albeit to different extents, with the electron affinity of the fullerene determining the degree of stabilization. A fullerene LUMO level of −3.75 eV is found to cause maximum stabilization, while the degradation rate increases for higher and lower values. Remarkably, the higher the stabilization effect imposed by the fullerene the slower the fullerene degrades itself, which indicates a non-sacrificial mode of stabilization. Transient absorption spectroscopy measurements show similar kinetics of exciton quenching and charge generation for all P3HT:fullerene combinations indicating a similar morphology in all blend films. Inverted solar cells made from the different P3HT:fullerene blends exhibit a good correlation between fullerene LUMO level and open-circuit voltage. Upon illumination in air, the photovoltaic devices follow the same degradation trend as the isolated photoactive layers by showing the same dependence on the fullerene LUMO level. Finally, we discuss different mechanisms, by which fullerene acceptors are potentially able to stabilize (UV light screening, excited-state quenching, and radical scavenging) as well as destabilize (morphological effects, superoxide or singlet oxygen sensitization, and polymer triplet-state population) donor polymers.
1. Introduction
The research and development of organic photovoltaics (OPV) is world-wide a topic of high interest and achieved great progress during the last years. Current power conversion efficiencies of >17% for small lab cells and >12% for larger modules make OPV finally competitive against other photovoltaic technologies, which are already well-established on the market.1 However, successful commercialization also requires long-term stability, an aspect that receives way less research attention than the pursuit of record efficiencies. One major problem regarding this is the organic nature of the photoactive materials, which makes them generally susceptible to photo-oxidation. Therefore, the solar modules need to be well-encapsulated in order to inhibit the ingress of oxygen and other harmful species. For light-weight and flexible applications, very expensive high-barrier foils with sufficiently low oxygen transmission rates (OTR) and water vapor transmission rates (WVTR) have to be used, which make the final product less economical or even uneconomical. In addition, such barrier foils can only decelerate the oxygen ingress but never fully prevent it. Consequently, making the photoactive materials more resistant towards photo-oxidation either directly increases the solar cell lifetime (even if encapsulated) or allows the use of cheaper encapsulation solutions with higher OTR values while maintaining the device lifetime.
When studying the degradation behavior of photoactive systems, it is important to not only investigate the individual materials but also the combination of electron donor and acceptor, since certain degradation pathways may be deactivated or additional ones may be activated in the final blend. Such stabilizing or destabilizing effects upon photo-oxidation have already been reported for a variety of material combinations including different polymer donors, fullerene-based acceptors, and non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs).2–5 One interesting outcome is that the fullerene electron acceptor [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) can act in a strongly stabilizing as well as destabilizing manner, depending on the type of electron donor polymer it is blended with.2 Another remarkable finding is that systems with fullerene electron acceptors show generally a higher stability compared to those with NFAs.3,4 Moreover, a correlation between the electron affinity of the electron acceptor and the resulting stability of the electron donor polymer is found for both fullerenes and NFAs, namely the higher the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the acceptor the higher the photo-oxidation rate of the donor.4,5 However, all such investigations so far only involve LUMO levels higher than that of PCBM but not lower ones. Furthermore, it is difficult to directly evaluate the role of the electron acceptor's LUMO level during degradation, if the chemical structure of the acceptors differs too much (e.g. fullerene derivatives vs. NFAs, C60vs. C70-based, etc.), since differences in stability may not necessarily be related to the electron affinity only. Finally, it is always important to examine if the degradation of the photoactive materials actually constitutes the lifetime bottleneck in the final device, i.e. if it correlates with the degradation of the performance of the solar cell.
Therefore, in this study, we investigate a series of C60-based derivatives with different substituents giving rise to different LUMO levels and study their influence on the performance and stability of inverted solar cells as well as the degradation of the photoactive materials upon illumination in air.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Materials
Poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT, Mw = 59.5 kg mol−1, Đ = 1.49) was purchased from Merck. Polyethylenimine (PEI) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM, 99.5%) and its bis-substituted analog (bisPCBM, 99.5%) were purchased from Solenne. All other fullerenes being investigated in this work have been synthesized by Konarka Technologies Inc. according to previously published standard synthetic routes.6–9 The LUMO level energy of all fullerene derivatives has been measured by cyclic voltammetry using the method described by Kooistra et al.10 In particular, ferrocene was used as an external standard, whose vacuum level was taken as −4.8 eV. The working electrode was a platinum disk, the counter electrode was a Pt wire, and the reference electrode was Ag/AgN03 (0.01 M)/nBu4NPF6 (0.1 M)/CH3CN.
2.2. Sample preparation
P3HT:fullerene solutions with a ratio of 1:0.7 and a total solid concentration of 17 mg ml−1 in o-xylene:1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalene (7:1) were prepared under inert atmosphere and stirred over night at 80 °C. Thin films of these blends were deposited by doctor blading in ambient air with an absorbance of 0.7–0.8 at the P3HT absorption maximum. For spectroscopic application, soda-lime glass microscope slides were used as a substrate. Inverted solar cells were prepared on glass/ITO substrates. The hole blocking layer (PEI, 0.1 wt% in n-butanol) and the electron blocking layer (a confidential material of Konarka Technologies Inc.) were deposited by doctor blading in ambient air. A silver electrode with a thickness of 50 nm was evaporated. Both single active layers and complete solar cells were annealed for 3 min at 140 °C under inert atmosphere.
2.3. Degradation
Active layer thin films were photo-oxidized by exposing them to the light of a metal halide lamp (AM 1.5, 1000 W m−2) in ambient air at a temperature of 45 °C and 10% relative humidity. The progress of degradation was monitored with a PerkinElmer Lambda 35 UV/vis spectrometer. Photo-oxidation of the solar cells was performed using the same irradiation source in a measurement board equipped with a gas feed line providing dry synthetic air. Current–voltage characteristics of the solar cells were recorded during the course of degradation using a Keithley 2400 Source Measurement Unit in combination with a Keithley 7001 Multiplexer system and custom software.
2.4. Ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy
The pump–probe experiment was performed in the TAPPS (transient absorption pump–probe system) Helios of Ultrafast Systems, including a two-beam setup. The used fs-laser (Model CPA-2101, Clark-MXR Inc., 775 nm, 1 kHz, 150 fs pulse width) is based on a regenerative chirped-pulse titanium-sapphire amplifier. The pump pulse of 480 nm and 100 nJ is produced by a NOPA (non-collinear optical parametrical amplifier). The probe pulse is delayed by an electronically controlled optical bench of 8.0 ns length and focused in a 3 mm thick sapphire crystal to generate a white light continuum by self-phase modulation. Changes in the absorption were measured in the visible and in the near infrared region. All measurements were carried out under inert atmosphere in a gastight sample chamber with quartz windows.
3. Results

Table 1 shows the chemical structures of the seven fullerene derivatives under investigation including their short names and their LUMO level energy measured vs. ferrocene. The respective full names are F1: indene-C60 bis-adduct (ICBA), F2: bis-substituted [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (bisPCBM), F3: tetramethoxyphenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (TMPCBM), F4: [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM), F5: [6,6]-propylphenyl-C61-triofluoromethane (PPCCF3), F6: [6,6]-hexylbiphenyl-pyrazolino-C60-nitrobenzene (HBPCPNB), and F7: [6,6]-cyanophenyl-pyrazolino-C60-nitrobenzene (CNPCPNB). All of the investigated fullerenes are based on C60 and bear one (F3–F7) or two (F1 + F2) organic substituents. The substituents are connected via cyclopentane, cyclopropane, and pyrazoline groups, for F1, F2–F5, and F6–F7, respectively. The well-studied PCBM has a LUMO level of −3.70 eV and forms thereby the center of our fullerene electron affinity range from −3.53 eV (ICBA) to −3.83 eV (CNPCPNB).

3.1. Photo-degradation of P3HT:fullerene films in air
In order to study the photo-oxidation behavior of different P3HT:fullerene combinations, thin films of P3HT and blends with all seven of the aforementioned fullerene derivatives are coated onto glass slides and exposed to irradiation in ambient air, while the progress of degradation is monitored by UV/vis spectroscopy.
The initial absorption spectra of the seven different blend films are shown in Fig. 1. All spectra show a broad absorption band around 510 nm featured by two shoulders at higher wavelengths stemming from different vibrational modes of the S0 → S1 (essentially HOMO → LUMO) transition in P3HT. This conformity in vibrational fine structure indicates a similar degree of P3HT crystallinity in all blend films. A maximum absorbance of 0.75 (±0.05) for all samples correlates with a layer thickness of about 150 nm. The second absorption maximum around 330 nm can be attributed to absorption of the fullerene. More precisely, it represents its HOMO → LUMO+1 transition. In case of the bis-adducts F1 and F2, the main fullerene absorption is only visible as a shoulder at 320 nm, as it is shifted to higher energies due to the double-substitution of the fullerene cage. F6 and F7 bear a nitrophenyl group, which is responsible for an additional absorption around 400 nm in their spectra.
 Fig. 1  Initial UV/vis spectra of all P3HT:fullerene (1:0.7) blend films. 
All samples are degraded simultaneously up to 50 h by irradiation with a solar simulator (AM1.5, 1000 W m−2) at ambient atmosphere and their UV/vis absorption spectra are recorded from time to time to follow the progress of degradation. Fig. 2 shows a series of these absorption spectra for the P3HT:F3 blend upon photo-oxidation. Primarily, a significant loss of absorption going hand in hand with a slight hypsochromic shift is observed for the P3HT peak (510 nm) during the course of the experiment. A similar behavior is observed for the fullerene absorption at 330 nm, albeit to a lesser extent. These changes in absorption upon degradation are qualitatively the same for every investigated P3HT:fullerene blend (Fig. S1, ESI†). The degradation rates differ, however.

Fig. 3 illustrates the extent of the polymer absorption loss for all seven blends by plotting the normalized absorbance at the respective P3HT maximum (∼510 nm) versus time. For comparison, the degradation of a neat P3HT film with identical initial absorbance is also shown. Obviously, the degradation rate of P3HT is much lower in all blend films compared to the neat polymer film. Thus, the presence of the fullerene imparts a stabilizing effect on the polymer against photo-oxidation. Notably, the degree of stabilization is not the same for the different fullerene derivatives. For example, in combination with fullerene F1 only 53% of the initial P3HT absorbance is retained after 50 h of degradation, whereas F5 imposes stronger stabilizing effects on P3HT resulting in an absorption loss of only 13%.
 Fig. 3  Normalized absorbance of P3HT during the course of photo-oxidation for all P3HT:fullerene blend films and a neat P3HT film (dark red stars). 
In order to quantify the stabilization effect, we introduce a stabilization factor, which is calculated by the P3HT relative absorption loss after 30 h of degradation in the neat film (66.7%) divided by the respective value for the blend films (8.9–31.6%). In Fig. 4, this stabilization factor is plotted for the seven different fullerenes as a function of their LUMO level (red bars). It is found that the different fullerene derivatives stabilize the polymer against photo-oxidation by a factor in the range of 2.1 to 7.5. Remarkably, the extent of stabilization is found to depend on the electron affinity of the fullerene. A maximum stabilization effect (factor 7.5) is found for F5 (PPCCF3) with a LUMO level of −3.75 eV. For higher and lower electron affinities the ability of the fullerene to stabilize P3HT against photo-oxidation decreases.
 Fig. 4  Stabilization factor of the seven different fullerenes on P3HT (red bars) and the respective absorbance loss of the fullerenes (blue) after 30 h of photo-degradation in air as a function of the fullerene LUMO level. 
In addition, the evaluation of the temporal evolution of the fullerene absorption maximum (or shoulder) around 330 nm quantifies the degradation of the respective fullerene derivative in the different blend films. However, also P3HT and especially its oxidation products contribute to the absorption of the blend films at 330 nm (i.e. a neat P3HT film shows increasing UV absorbance upon photo-oxidation). Therefore, the absorbance of the blend films around 330 nm is adjusted for P3HT contributions (by using spectral data of a degrading neat P3HT film) in order to evaluate the mere fullerene absorption. The blue data points in Fig. 4 show the resulting absolute loss of fullerene absorbance evaluated at the respective fullerene absorption after 30 h of degradation. Obviously, the degradation of the fullerene follows the same LUMO level dependency as the respective stabilization factor on P3HT. In other words, a higher stabilization factor correlates with less degradation of the fullerene. Consequently, in the P3HT:F5 blend, in which the stabilizing effect of the fullerene is the greatest, both P3HT and the fullerene degrade the least.
3.2. Photo-degradation of P3HT:fullerene solar cells in air
Inverted solar cells based on these seven P3HT:fullerene blends are manufactured. Their initial device performance is shown in Table 2, averaging eight individual cells per blend. It is to note that all solar cell variations are manufactured using the exact same processes and recipes, i.e. they are not individually optimized, in order to exclude potential differences in degradation induced by variable factors such as different donor–acceptor ratios, interface materials, or solvent additives. Since we based the manufacturing on processes that are optimized for the most common active material system P3HT:PCBM (F4), the devices based on this material system exhibit the highest jSC values in this experiment. Besides this, the power conversion efficiency (η) of the devices decreases with increasing electron affinity of the fullerene. This phenomenon originates from the decreasing VOC with decreasing fullerene LUMO level, since the VOC is mainly determined by the energy difference between the polymer HOMO and the fullerene LUMO.

The solar cells are irradiated with a solar simulator (AM1.5, 1000 W m−2) in dry air and their jV-curves are recorded from time to time to follow the progress of degradation. Fig. 5 shows the current–voltage characteristics of a P3HT:PCBM (F4) solar cell during the course of degradation. Obviously, the short circuit current is the most affected parameter and, thus, determines the efficiency loss of the device. In P3HT:PCBM, 15 min of degradation lead to a decrease of jSC by about one third causing a total efficiency loss of about 40%. Like for the degradation of the isolated photoactive layers, the observed changes in device performance upon degradation are qualitatively the same for every investigated P3HT:fullerene blend, but the kinetics differ.

Fig. 6 depicts the power conversion efficiency of the different P3HT:fullerene solar cells during the course of photo-degradation in air normalized to their initial value. Again, the highest degradation rate is observed for the P3HT:ICBA (F1) blend with a device efficiency loss of about 90% after 15 min of degradation, while the P3HT:PCBM (F4) based devices maintain about 60% of the initial efficiency at this stage. Devices containing F5 and F6 show an increase of efficiency (due to an enhanced jSC) during the first 15 min of degradation suggesting certain t0-performance limitations and/or initially hindered oxygen penetration into these devices (possibly due to a slightly higher density of the 50 nm Ag top electrode). After 3 h of degradation, all devices maintain less than 30% of their initial efficiency. An additional annealing step of 5 min at 140 °C in the dark under inert atmosphere recovers the device efficiency partially (last data points). Remarkably, the extent of recovery scales with the amount of maintained efficiency, which is in line with studies of Seemann et al. on the reversibility of photo-oxidation of P3HT:PCBM cells.16 For example, almost no efficiency increase is seen for the hardly working P3HT:F1 devices, but an enhancement from about 20% to 40% relative efficiency for the P3HT:F7 system.

3.3. Ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy on P3HT:fullerene films
To investigate the ongoing processes in the active layer after excitation of the polymer, and by this, see potential differences among the different P3HT:fullerene blends, transient absorption measurements on the fs-timescale are performed. Thin layers (∼150 nm) of every blend are measured under inert atmosphere to examine the influence of the fullerene on the kinetics of all the involved species. Two different detectors are used to cover differential absorption change in the visible and the near infrared regions.
A series of transient absorption spectra of P3HT:F3 (TMPCBM) with time delays up to 5 ns is presented in Fig. 7. The change of detectors is seen at around 770 nm. On the short wavelength side of the spectrum, a broad negative signal develops. The narrow peak at 480 nm belongs to the pump pulse. The signals at 510, 550, and 600 nm represent the ground state bleaching of P3HT, in analogy to the three vibrational sub-bands of the main absorption band of P3HT. The broad absorption around 1100 nm relates to the P3HT singlet exciton.11 Obviously, the latter signal vanishes very fast, indicating that after 100 ps hardly any P3HT molecule is present in its S1 state anymore. Electron transfer to the fullerene forms cationic P3HT polarons, which are responsible for the persistent signal at 1000 nm. The simultaneously formed fullerene radical anion also absorbs in this region, but cannot be resolved due to its low absorption coefficient of about 6000 M−1 cm−1.12 The remaining two peaks at 650 nm and 830 nm can also be ascribed to polymer polarons. Studies by Gou et al. suggest that the signal at 650 nm belongs to delocalized P3HT polarons in crystalline domains, whereas the signal at 1000 nm belongs to localized polarons in disordered domains.13 The fact that the polaron bands at 650, 830, and 1000 nm are already present in the initial spectrum signifies that a substantial amount of charges is already formed within the first 100 fs after the pump pulse. Qualitatively, all P3HT:fullerene blends show the same spectral appearance described above, while slight differences in intensities and kinetics at specific wavelengths can be observed when changing the fullerene.
 Fig. 7  Transient absorption spectra of a P3HT:F3 film measured under nitrogen atmosphere. The pump pulse had a wavelength of 480 nm and an energy of 100 nJ. The measurements were performed under nitrogen atmosphere. 
In Fig. 8, the maximum intensities of the exciton absorption at 1200 nm and the polaron absorption at 1000 nm are depicted. The exciton absorption is extracted from the initial spectra right after the pump pulse, while the polaron absorption is evaluated 200 ps after the pump pulse, which is when P3HT singlet excitons are no longer present and do not contribute to the signal at 1000 nm anymore. For the blend films comprising fullerene F1 (−3.53 eV) to F5 (−3.75 eV), both the highest measurable P3HT singlet exciton concentration as well as the polaron yield after 200 ps are found to be in the same range, independently of the fullerene LUMO level. Fullerenes F4 and F5 show slightly higher charge concentrations than F1–F3 after 200 ps, due to somewhat reduced geminate recombination (Fig. S2, ESI†). For the two fullerenes with highest electron affinity, namely F6 (−3.81 eV) and F7 (−3.83 eV), the initial exciton concentration and especially the yield of persistent charges are a bit lower compared to the other blends.
 Fig. 8  Maximum intensity of the P3HT singlet exciton absorption at 1200 nm (red) and P3HT polaron absorption at 1000 nm (blue) 200 ps after the pump pulse for all P3HT:fullerene blend films plotted over the fullerene LUMO level. 

Fig. 9 illustrates the decay kinetics of the P3HT singlet exciton band for all P3HT:fullerene blend films. The signal is evaluated at 1200 nm to exclude contributions of the adjacent polaron band at 1000 nm. As bimolecular processes (S1–S1 annihilation) dominate the photophysics during the first picosecond after the pump pulse (Fig. S3, ESI†), the decay is not strictly exponential. After 10 ps the signal has lost 70–80% of its initial intensity for all variations and has vanished completely after 200 ps. The fact that in the time regime of 1–200 ps after the pump pulse the P3HT exciton quenching rate is independent of the kind of fullerene it is blended with, suggests that for all blends the deactivation of P3HT excitons by charge transfer to the fullerene is kinetically determined by the singlet exciton diffusion towards the electron donor–acceptor interface rather, but not limited by the actual electron transfer process to the fullerene. Moreover, it implies that the morphology is similar for all P3HT:fullerene blend films, i.e. the domain sizes are in the same range.

4. Discussion
Irradiation of P3HT:fullerene-based inverted solar cells in air leads to a rapid decrease in efficiency. The results of this work show that both the conjugated polymer and the fullerene undergo photo-oxidation when being exposed to these conditions. Moreover, the degradation rates are found to depend strongly on the type of fullerene P3HT is blended with. In Fig. 10, we directly correlate the degradation of the complete photovoltaic devices and the isolated photoactive layers of P3HT blended with different fullerenes by plotting the remaining device efficiency after 3 h (red data) and the remaining P3HT absorbance after 30 h of photo-oxidation (blue data), all of them normalized to their initial values. We find that photo-degradation of both whole solar cells and P3HT itself shows the same dependency on the electron affinity of the fullerene. The highest stability is obtained for the fullerene derivative F5 (PPCCF3) with a LUMO level of −3.75 eV, while both increased and decreased electron affinities of the fullerene lead to less stable systems. The good correlation of polymer bleaching rate with decrease in cell performance verifies that degradation studies on isolated films of the photoactive materials are a powerful approach to forecast the stability of complete devices based on these materials.

Comparing the degradation of P3HT in neat polymer films and blend films with different fullerenes, the polymer is found to be stabilized by all investigated fullerenes, albeit to different extents. Remarkably, also the degradation of the fullerene itself follows the same dependency as the polymer degradation. Fig. 11 plots the relative absorption loss of the fullerene versus the relative absorption loss of P3HT for all seven investigated P3HT:fullerene blend films upon irradiation in air. Interestingly, fullerene and polymer decomposition exhibit a linear correlation with an identical slope for all investigated blends, with the relative degradation rate of P3HT being about six times faster than that of the fullerene. This finding indicates that the photo-oxidation rates of polymer and fullerene are linked to each other in a way that the ratio is constant over time and independent of the type of fullerene. Changing the fullerene solely affects the degradation rate of both species to the same extent. This suggests that decomposition of polymer and fullerene is induced by the same species, whose steady-state concentration is moderated by the fullerene, which is in accordance with the work of Speller et al.4 Furthermore, this indicates a non-sacrificial mode of stabilization imposed by the fullerene.

The photo-oxidation of electron donor polymers (especially P3HT) and fullerene electron acceptors (especially PCBM) and its effect on solar cell performance has already been studied and reported in the literature.14 For P3HT, the formation of a metastable charge transfer complex consisting of cationic P3HT and anionic superoxide, which is reversible by heat or vacuum treatment, has been claimed to be decisive for the reversible part of device performance loss under photo-oxidative conditions.15–17 In addition, there is an irreversible photo-oxidation mechanism that is initialized by a radical attack (e.g. by superoxide) on the α-carbon atom of the hexyl side chain of P3HT, which has been mechanistically described by Abdou et al.18 For PCBM thin films, Reese et al. reported a stepwise uptake of up to eight oxygen atoms per fullerene being bound as epoxides upon illumination under ambient conditions, which leads to a gradual lowering of the fullerene LUMO level and reduces the electron mobility in the film.19 Remarkably, solar cells prepared from pristine P3HT and previously photo-oxidized PCBM also exhibit current–voltage characteristics similar to the photo-oxidized solar cells of our experiments.20,21
It is to note that in this work we cannot determine if it is the photo-oxidation of P3HT, the fullerene, or the combination of both, which directly causes the losses in solar cell performance. However, it shows that even if the photo-oxidation of the polymer is the Achilles’ heel in the degradation of inverted solar cells and decisive for the overall solar cell degradation, the fullerene it is blended with has a significant impact on the stability as well, as it directly influences the degradation rate of the polymer. In combination with P3HT, all investigated fullerenes are shown to stabilize the polymer against photo-oxidation. However, the varying extent of the stabilizing effect of the seven different fullerene derivatives on P3HT can actually be the result of a complex interaction of different mechanisms with different dependencies on the electron affinity. In fact, already the effect of one single fullerene derivative itself (e.g. PCBM) can range from strongly stabilizing to even destabilizing, depending on the conjugated polymer it is blended with.2 Due to this ambiguous behavior of the fullerene we will discuss in the following the different possible stabilizing and destabilizing effects of fullerenes.
4.1. Stabilizing effects
Common stabilizing mechanisms of additives against photo-oxidation are screening from UV light, excited-state quenching, and chemical effects (e.g. radical scavenging).19,22–24
Since the oxidative degradation of P3HT and other polymers is a photo-induced process, every kind of light-screening agent should diminish the degradation rate to some extent. Previously, Hintz et al. showed that the photo-oxidation rate of P3HT is not only linearly dependent on light intensity, but also exhibits wavelength dependence. In particular, a strong increase of effectiveness towards the ultraviolet region of the spectrum is seen.25 Especially fullerenes with their main absorption in the UV region are expected to stabilize P3HT by screening it from highly energetic photons. However, it has already been shown experimentally that light-screening only accounts for a small part of the stabilization of P3HT by PCBM during photo-oxidation.2 This suggests that also in the present work UV light-screening only plays a minor role in the stabilization process. Moreover, this effect cannot explain the varying extent of stabilization for the different fullerene derivatives, since the UV absorption of all investigated fullerenes is very similar.
Upon irradiation of a conjugated polymer, a large amount of singlet excitons is formed instantly, which is a very reactive species that can undergo various undesired reactions, finally leading to the deterioration of the molecule. In addition, intersystem crossing (ISC) to the long-lived triplet state may occur, which has a particularly high reactivity, especially with respect to molecular oxygen. Therefore, quenching of photo-excited states of a polymer is often considered one of the main mechanisms, by which the fullerene acts as stabilizer.19,23 However, previous reports have shown for various conjugated polymers, including P3HT, that mere quenching of the polymer singlet exciton does not have any stabilizing effect against photo-oxidation,2 which is in line with the finding that the photo-oxidation action spectrum of P3HT does not follow its absorption spectrum.25 In our present work, ultrafast transient absorption measurements show that in all investigated P3HT:fullerene blend films, the fullerene quenches the polymer singlet exciton very efficiently and faster than ISC to the polymer triplet state can occur. Moreover, the quenching kinetics are found to be the same for all fullerene derivatives, independently of the fullerene LUMO level, which corroborates that this mechanism also cannot account for the observed electron affinity dependence of the degradation.
The antioxidative activity on different kinds of bioorganic compounds and polymers is a well-known feature of fullerenes and is based on quenching reactive oxygen species.26–28 One major mechanistic reason for this property is the excellent radical scavenging ability of fullerenes, which makes them good free-radical reaction inhibitors.29–33 When homolytic fission of covalent bonds, e.g. induced by UV light, leads to the formation of free radicals, these radicals can cause great damage, as they are able to react with almost every adjacent molecule. It is known that a radical reaction is the decisive mechanism for the photo-oxidative degradation of many polymers, including P3HT, which is primarily attacked radically at the α-carbon atom of the alkyl side chain leading to the formation of reactive peroxide species, which are then responsible for the destruction of the conjugated π-system along the polymer backbone.18,34,35 For the conjugated polymer MDMO-PPV, thermo-oxidation and photo-oxidation were found to result in the same oxidation products and similar extents of stabilization by PCBM, suggesting indeed a radical scavenging stabilization mechanism by the fullerene in both cases.22 Comparing the stabilization effect of fullerenes with that of other antioxidants, e.g. nickel chelates, also leads to the conclusion that radical scavenging is the dominant mode of stabilization.36,37
4.2. Destabilizing effects
As mentioned before, fullerenes are not always stabilizing the polymer they are blended with against photo-oxidation. In some cases, the polymer degrades even faster when being blended with a fullerene (e.g. PCPDTBT:PCBM),2 which shows that the fullerene can also impose destabilizing effects.
Such a destabilization has already been reported by Hoke et al., especially for fullerenes with small electron affinities.5 Moreover, they also observed a gradual increase in polymer degradation rate when raising the fullerene LUMO level (starting from PCBM), which is fully in line with the findings of our present work. They suggested a degradation mechanism induced by superoxide anion radicals, which are formed by electron transfer from the fullerene anion to molecular oxygen, a process that is favored by higher fullerene LUMO levels. Analogous results and explanations have been presented by Speller et al., who also included NFAs in their work.4 This proposed mechanism is supported by the fact that the degradation of P3HT is accelerated in the presence of common superoxide sensitizers.38,39 Further support for this mechanism comes from the increase of the driving force for the reaction Fullerene + O2− → fullerene− + O2, which increases from ΔG0 ≈ 15 kJ mol−1 for PCBM to ΔG0 ≈ 0 for ICBA in aprotic environments, corresponding to a transition of the equilibrium constant from around 10−3 to unity.16
In addition, the morphology of the active layer also has a considerable influence on the photo-oxidation rate. Mateker et al. found for a variety of photoactive materials that a higher degree of crystallinity generally increases the stability of a material.40 Consequently, if the addition of a fullerene reduces the crystallinity of a polymer and causes the polymer to be more amorphous in the blend film than in a neat polymer film, this can lead to an increased polymer degradation rate in the blend. This destabilizing effect can play a particularly important role for polymer–fullerene combinations that show strong intermixing, such as PCPDTBT:PCBM, where the fullerene is finely dispersed in a rather amorphous polymer matrix.41 In our present study, the UV/vis and TAS data suggest a similar morphology for all P3HT:fullerene blends, which most likely comprises highly crystalline polymer domains like known for P3HT:PCBM.42 Hence, this destabilizing effect cannot account for differences in stability among the different blends and probably plays a minor role in this study.
Some OPV materials are known for their high susceptibility to singlet oxygen. One of them is poly(thieno[3,4-b]thiophene-alt-benzodithiophene) (PTB7), an electron donor polymer that is also reported to be destabilized when being blended with a fullerene, both in solution and films.43 This enhanced degradation correlates with an increased singlet oxygen formation in the blend, which occurs by energy transfer from either the polymer (see next paragraph) or the fullerene triplet state. Although the triplet yield of PCBM films is significantly lower than in solution,44,45 it is measurable46 and can be increased by reducing the aggregation of the fullerene by blending it, for example, with polystyrene, which is indeed found to enhance photo-oxidation.47 Consequently, fullerene-mediated sensitization of singlet oxygen is a potential destabilizing mechanism, again, especially for blend films in which the fullerene is finely dispersed rather than aggregated.
Another mechanism of destabilization arises from the population of the charge transfer state (CTS) between the polymers and the fullerenes, which is instantly formed at the interface upon electron transfer from the polymer exciton (S1) and whose energy is directly related to the electron affinity of the involved fullerene (Fig. 12). This species can be very long-lived (≥1 ns for PCPDTBT:PCBM)48 and has manifold pathways of deactivation. On one hand, the electron can take the desired route into the fullerene LUMO, leading to charge separation, or, alternatively, fall back to the polymer HOMO, leading to charge recombination and repopulation of the ground state (S0). On the other hand, charge recombination can also result in the population of the polymer triplet state (T1) depending on the energies of the T1 and the CTS relative to each other (see Fig. 12).2 If the energy of the polymer T1 is high enough, it can then potentially sensitize singlet oxygen, which, in turn, can lead to degradation of the polymer. Finally, Grancini et al. explained the critical role of the CTS by its ability to directly generate other reactive species such as superoxide radicals.49 All in all, this again implies for the fullerenes of our study that the higher the LUMO level the higher the energy of the CTS and, consequently, the higher its potential to destabilize the polymer.
 Fig. 12  Mechanistic scheme of the charge transfer state (CTS) population between P3HT and fullerenes with different electron affinity (F1–F7) after photon absorption (A) by the P3HT ground state (S0) and subsequent electron transfer (ET) from its singlet excited state (S1). Depending on the energy of the CTS, electron back-transfer can potentially lead to sensitization of the polymer triplet state (T1). 
In summary, there are many different mechanisms, by which fullerene acceptors can stabilize or destabilize the donor polymer and it is difficult to individually quantify them. Previously reported correlations between the photo-oxidation rate of the polymer and the LUMO level of the acceptor have the general consensus that the higher the LUMO level, the more degradation is observed.4,5 This indicates that the sensitization of superoxide and/or the population of the polymer triplet-state by the fullerene play a decisive role, since both destabilizing mechanisms share this very dependency. However, by extending the range of LUMO levels to values lower than that of PCBM (−3.70 eV), for the first time, we observe a deviation from this dependency, as beyond −3.75 eV the photo-oxidation rate is found to increase again with further decreasing LUMO level. This suggests that beyond an electron affinity of −3.75 eV the destabilizing mechanisms mentioned above become energetically unfavorable and thus less relevant. In addition, other destabilizing mechanisms must become more dominant or the overall stabilizing mechanisms weaker. In conclusion, the stability of a fullerene and its ability to stabilize the donor polymer cannot be related solely to its electron affinity, but also other aspects and characteristics need to be considered.
5. Conclusions
The photo-oxidation behavior of P3HT and C60-based derivatives with different electron affinities has been investigated in isolated thin films as well as in complete solar cells. We have found a good correlation between the absorbance loss of the active materials (both P3HT and the fullerene) and the respective solar cell performance loss, all of them showing the same dependence on the fullerene LUMO level. These results demonstrate, on one hand, that degradation studies on isolated active layers already provide valuable indications about the stability of the corresponding photovoltaic devices. On the other hand, they show a direct relation between the photo-oxidation rates of P3HT and the fullerene, i.e. the faster P3HT degrades the faster also the fullerene degrades. In other words, the higher the stabilization effect imposed by the fullerene the slower the fullerene degrades itself, which indicates a non-sacrificial mode of stabilization. Finally, we have found maximum stabilization for a fullerene LUMO level of −3.75 eV, while degradation rates increase for both higher and lower values, which implies that the position of the LUMO level is not the only factor determining photo-oxidation rates but the chemical structure of the fullerene may also play a role.
