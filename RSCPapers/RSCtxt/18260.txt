    , Accepted 20th June 2018First published on 20th June 2018AbstractThe recombination rates of two typical D–π–A dyes have been evaluated qualitatively by means of quantum chemical calculations. By dissecting the geometrical and electronic structures of the dyes, the function of the inserted phenyl ring in inhibiting recombination is recognized as the blocking of back electron transfer and decreasing the HOMO distribution on the anchoring group, but with the distorted structure caused by the inserted benzene ring also decreasing the light harvesting ability. Molecular designs for the screening of potential dyes are carried out with a comprehensive consideration of both suppressing recombination and enhancing light absorption. Tightening the adjacent rings in the donor and π-spacer is verified to be a feasible route for extending the π-conjugation, thus leading to red-shifted and broad absorption spectra. The calculated results show that the dyes possessing both a small distribution of the HOMO on the anchoring group and a relatively strong light harvesting ability are the most promising candidates for use in dye-sensitized solar cells. Moreover, this work provides a deep understanding of the relationship between the electron recombination rate and electronic structure of dyes, and provides theoretical guidelines for the design of high performance sensitizer materials.
1 Introduction
There has recently been great enthusiasm shown towards solar power conversion due to the increasing demands for clean and renewable energy.1,2 Among the known photovoltaic conversion techniques, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are attractive because of their utilisation of abundant and low-cost materials and ease of manufacture.3–7 As a crucial component of a DSSC, the sensitizer plays a dominant role in the cell performance since it is in charge of sunlight harvesting, exciton formation and separation. Over the past two decades, tremendous endeavours have been made towards the search for efficient dyes with desired photophysical properties and high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs). Thus far, the PCEs of the well-known metal-based dyes, such as ruthenium polypyridyl complexes and zinc porphyrin dyes, have been reported to be over 11%.8–13 However, in view of the metal toxicity of ruthenium complexes and the tedious synthesis of zinc porphyrin dyes, metal-free organic dyes have been considered as a promising alternative because of their low cost, non-toxicity, high molar extinction coefficient and structural adjustability.14,15 Although metal-free sensitizers might have their own drawbacks, such as a narrow absorption spectrum and fast charge recombination rate due to the presence of heteroatoms,16 impressive progress has been made, with reported PCEs of over 12%.17–19 It is believed that there is still room for improving the performance of organic dyes by further optimising their chemical structures.
One of the more efficient molecular design strategies towards metal-free organic dyes constitutes the proper combination of an electron donor (D), π-spacer and electron acceptor (A), which could significantly enrich the diversities of sensitizers.7,20 The appropriate arrangement of molecular building components could not only regulate the UV-Vis absorption spectra and energy levels, thus determining the light harvesting ability, but also affect the compatibility of these components at the titania/dye/electrolyte interface. Recently, Haid et al. reported two D–π–A sensitizers (1 and 2 as shown in Fig. 1),21 in which triphenylamine was chosen as the donor, oligothiophene as the π-bridge, and benzothiadiazole (BTD)/cyanoacrylic acid (CAA) as the acceptor. Surprisingly, it was found that a small structural modification of 1 by the insertion of a phenyl ring between BTD and CAA resulted in a significantly improved PCE for 2 of 8.21%, which is 6.5 times higher than that of 1 (1.24%). Similarly, Yella et al. employed the same strategy to design and synthesize zinc porphyrin-based D–π–A dyes, in which the benzene used as a spacer between BTD and CAA also plays a dominant role in the cell performance, with the PCE soaring up to 12.5% from the 2.5% observed for the dye without a phenyl unit.12 BTD in 1 is nearly coplanar with an adjacent thienyl ring and CAA group, while the insertion of a phenyl ring in 2 leads to a dihedral angle of about 34.6° between BTD and the phenyl ring. Structurally, the additional phenyl ring between BTD and CAA could reduce the π-conjugation of dyes because of the lack of planarity between BTD and the phenyl ring, which is further verified from the blue-shifted absorption spectra observed in the experiment.12,21 Thus the introduction of a phenyl ring seems adverse to the improvement of the light-absorbing ability of dyes. The effect of the additional phenyl ring on the cell performance remains to be elucidated at a microscopic level. A deep understanding of the structure–property relationship should be established for these dyes.

Photophysical measurements revealed that the inserted phenyl ring could block the back electron transfer from the TiO2-photoanode to the oxidized dyes, slowing down charge recombination (CR) by over 5 or 10 times in the case of an iodide-based redox electrolyte.12,21 The charge recombination between the photoanode and the dye or electrolyte at the interface is one of the limiting factors of DSSCs and plays a crucial role in the cell performance. It is still a challenging task to investigate charge injection and recombination at a molecular level experimentally because of the complex processes occurring at the titania/dye/electrolyte interface. First principles calculations have advantages over some experimental investigations, especially for electronic structures associated with structural modifications, electronic coupling between dyes and the TiO2-photoanode, and electron dynamics at the dye/TiO2 interface. Zhang et al. reported a distance-dependent charge recombination mechanism to rationalize the marked PCE difference between sensitizers 1 and 2.22 Chou et al. predicated the charge recombination rates from TiO2 to the cationic dye, which were found to follow a trend similar to experimental results.23 Ma et al. performed real-time excited state simulations of model compounds at a dye/semiconductor interface, and revealed that the insertion of an additional phenyl ring could slow down the charge recombination rate by about 4 times and maintain almost the same charge injection rate.24 The calculated charge recombination rates were found to be in good agreement with experimental results.
In view of the molecular design of novel sensitizers, a strategy demonstrating how to suppress charge recombination without sacrificing the light-absorbing ability of dyes is still lacking. In this work, we intend to carry out a computational dissection of the electronic structures of dyes in order to determine the factors that are closely associated with the charge recombination rate, and provide guidance for the molecular design of novel dyes. Density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) methods are employed to investigate both the geometrical and electronic properties of the dyes and dye–TiO2 complexes. We find that the small proportion of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) distributed on the anchoring groups of the dyes could be beneficial for reducing charge recombination. Thus, based on such rules, we theoretically design a series of novel dyes by reinforcing the π-conjugation in the donor and π-spacer segments, thus enhancing the light absorption in order to compensate for the reduced π-conjugation caused by the insertion of the phenyl ring between BTD and CAA. Based on reasonable approximations and assumptions, we aim to make a connection between the recombination rate and electronic structure of dyes, further establish the structure–property relationship, and design dyes for use in DSSCs.
2 Method
2.1 Theoretical evaluation of the recombination rate
The basic principle of DSSCs is based on the concept of the photosensitization of a wide band-gap oxide semiconductor using a sensitizer. Photoexcitation of a dye leads to exciton generation, separation, and electron injection from the excited state of the dye to the conduction band of TiO2. However, charge recombination between the electron in the TiO2 and the oxidized dye will drastically decrease the performance of an operative DSSC.25,26 Thus charge recombination must be avoided if possible, or at least minimized in order to reach a high PCE. The electron recombination rate can be described by the nonadiabatic electron transfer theory:27,28 (1)where V is the electronic coupling between the two states before and after electron transfer from the conduction band of TiO2 to the oxidized dyes, Λ represents the reorganization energy and ΔG° is the Gibbs free energy difference for the electron transfer reaction. T is the temperature (298.15 K) and kB and ħ are the Boltzmann and reduced Planck constants, respectively.
Two states are involved in the charge recombination process. In the initial state, |i〉, the electron has been injected into the conduction band of TiO2 and the dye is positively charged, while in the final state, |f〉, the dye is neutral. The electronic coupling between these two states is approximated with a single electron model as:29 (2)The electronic configuration of the initial and final state corresponds to the transfer of an electron from the conduction band of TiO2 () to the HOMO of the dye (ΨdyeHOMO).  is the relevant one-electron operator. The electronic states in the CB of TiO2 are supposed to be almost the same since as the TiO2 nanoparticles are a bulk material, the adsorption of similar sensitizers could barely affect the conduction band of TiO2. Thus the difference in electronic coupling for similar dyes is mostly determined by the HOMO of the dye. It has been demonstrated that the dyes in DSSCs are covalently bonded to the Ti atoms at the surface of TiO2 in order to ensure effective charge injection.30 The electron back transfer from TiO2 to the dye is also through the chemical bonds at the dye–TiO2 interface. Therefore, the significant difference in the HOMO of dyes related to electronic coupling is due to the weighting of the anchoring group CAA (QHOMO) in the composition of the HOMO. Since the impact of the environment on the recombination process would be almost the same for similar sensitizers, and the calculation errors for QHOMO are the same when using the same method, QHOMO can be used to evaluate the relative electronic coupling strength in the charge recombination process.31 Indeed, QHOMO is closely related to the experimental recombination rate.32–34
The reorganization energy Λ is a key parameter in Marcus electron transfer theory and describes the energy that is required for the geometrical changes of the dye–TiO2 system in the charge recombination process. It consists of contributions from the inner reorganization energy (Λin, which is induced by intramolecular vibrations) and the external reorganization (Λext, which is caused by the polarization of the surrounding medium). Since the TiO2 nanoparticles are much larger than the dyes, the reorganization energy comes mainly from the contribution of the dye. In the charge recombination process, Λin can be calculated as follows: Λin = E+0 − E+opt(3)where E+0 and E+opt are the energies of the cationic species in their neutral-state and optimized cationic-state geometries, respectively. The calculation of Λext for the dyes is based on the PCM solvation model using an external iteration procedure.23
ΔG° can be obtained using the Rehm–Weller equation35 with a correction for the dielectric solvation energy: (4)where E0 is the oxidation potential of the dye which can be calculated through the Born–Haber cycle36 and ECB is the Fermi level of the TiO2 conduction band (−4.0 eV, an experimental value corresponding to conditions where TiO2 is in contact with aqueous redox electrolytes with a fixed pH of 7.05,37,38). Δq corresponds to the transferred charges in the dye–TiO2 complex. rTiO2 and rdye+ are the radii of the TiO2 nanoparticle and the cationic dye, respectively. dTiO2–dye+ is the distance from the center of mass of the cationic dye to the semiconductor surface. ε0, εref and εs correspond to the vacuum permittivity, the dielectric constant for the reference solvent (εref = 8.9 for dichloromethane (CH2Cl2)) and the dielectric constant for the real system in a DSSC cell (εs = 36.64 for acetonitrile), respectively. The 1/rTiO2 term is regarded as 0 because of the large size of the TiO2 nanoparticle, and rdye+ is the radius of a sphere with the same molecular volume as the cationic dye, which is calculated by Monte-Carlo integration.
Using the calculated Λ and ΔG° values, we could evaluate the exponential contribution (EXP) to the electron recombination rate. The comparison of the recombination rate does not necessarily agree with experimental values, but may reflect a trend in a series of structurally similar compounds.
2.2 Computational details
For the sake of reducing the computational cost, the long alkoxy chains of the dyes were replaced by methoxy groups. For D–A type organic molecules with extended π systems, DFT and TDDFT approaches with standard exchange–correlation functionals fail severely in the prediction of both ground-state orbital energies39,40 and electronic absorption spectra.41,42 Therefore, DFT methods with the inclusion of a fixed percentage of nonlocal Hartree–Fock exchange (HFexc) in the functional are the most commonly used in this regard.43 To determine the optimal amount of nonlocal HFexc in the DFT functional, an evaluation of different hybrid DFT functionals against experimental observables is mandatory. To better describe the ground state properties, hybrid functionals of B3LYP (20% HFexc),44 PBE0 (25% HFexc)45–48 and PBE38 (37.5% HFexc)49 with the 6-31G(d,p) basis set were employed to optimize 1 and 2 in a CH2Cl2 solution with a polarizable continuum model (PCM).50,51 The PBE0-calculated HOMOs for 1 and 2 were in good agreement with the experimental data, with relatively small errors within 0.2 eV (as listed in Table S1, ESI†). Therefore, the PBE0 functional was selected for the ground state geometry optimizations and the related ground state property calculations. The optimizations were tested with no imaginary frequencies to ensure that the optimized geometries were stable. For the accurate simulation of the absorption spectra and calculation of the excitation energies of the dyes, TD-DFT methods with B3LYP, PBE0, PBE0-1/3 (33.3% HFexc),52,53 MPW1K (42.8% HFexc),54 BHandHLYP (50% HFexc),55 CAM-B3LYP (19% HFexc at short-range and 65% HFexc at long-range)56 and ωB97XD (22% HFexc at short-range and 100% HFexc at long-range)57 were tested for 1 and 2 in a CH2Cl2 solution (as shown in Table S2, ESI†). The calculation results indicated that the BHandHLYP functional provides relatively accurate maximum absorption wavelengths in comparison with experimental data. Hence TDDFT-BHandHLYP was chosen for simulating the absorption spectra, and was previously used to calculate the excited-state properties of the molecules with charge transfer characteristics.58,59
The systems with dyes adsorbed on a Ti16O32 cluster were also optimized using the PBE0 functional with the pseudo-potential basis set LANL2DZ for Ti and 6-31G(d,p) for the rest of the atoms. The absorption spectra of the dyes were simulated by TD-DFT calculations with 50 vertical excitations, and the absorption peaks in the spectra were obtained with a uniform Gaussian broadening (0.4 eV for the half-width at half maximum) of the individual vertical transitions. Analysis of the composition of the frontier orbitals of the dyes was carried out using the Multiwfn software.60 All calculations were performed using the Gaussian 09 package.61
3 Results and discussion
3.1 Analysis of the electron recombination process
There is no doubt that electron recombination between the electron in the conduction band of TiO2 and the oxidized dyes will greatly decrease cell performance. We will analyze the possible electron recombination process and evaluate the key factors that affect the electron recombination rate. The optimized structures of 1 and 2 in their cationic states (dye+) with a schematic demonstrating their chemical anchoring to the TiO2 surface are shown in Fig. 2. The structures of the dye–TiO2 complexes are shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). The small cluster of anatase titania Ti16O32 with exposure at its (101) surface was selected as the model semiconductor substrate to adsorb the sensitizers. This cluster model is large enough to reproduce the electronic absorption spectra62,63 and has been successfully applied in investigations of the sensitization of nano-TiO2 in previous work.64,65 The calculated LUMO levels of the dyes are above the conduction band of (TiO2)16, and the HOMOs of the dyes are in the band gap of (TiO2)16 as shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†), thus indicating that the (TiO2)16 cluster could carry out the electronic processes that are responsible for DSSC functionality. The dye is adsorbed on TiO2via its carboxylate group in a bidentate bridging manner with one proton transferring to a nearby surface oxygen, as this has been proven to be the most favorable adsorption mode for the carboxylate group.66,67 Mulliken charge analyses show that the most positive charges are distributed on the TPA units of the dyes, especially for 1. The insertion of a phenyl ring makes the charge distribution in 2 quite different from that in 1. In oxidized dye 1, BTD is positively charged (net charge of +0.152). The electron in the conduction band of TiO2 can easily move back to the BDT unit in 1 because of the structural planarity and conjugation between CAA and BDT. BTD is a strong electron-withdrawing group that can be regarded as an electron trap. After charge recombination in BTD, the electron will cumulate here, and then move through the π-bridge to the TPA part to accomplish recombination. In the cationic state of 2, the back electron will initially recombine with the positive charge in the inserted benzene ring. Arriving of the electron at BTD will be hindered because of the structural distortion (32.5°) and lesser conjugation between BTD and the phenyl group. Therefore, the recombination rate in 2 possibly slows down at this stage.68
 Fig. 2  Schematic illustration of the charge recombination process in which the computed Mulliken charges (in units of e) of the cationic dyes are indicated. 
From the analyses of the charge recombination processes in 1 and 2, we know that structural changes in the vicinity of the anchoring group (CAA) will greatly affect the electron recombination rate. Such structural changes will definitely affect the HOMO distribution, which is closely related to the electronic coupling between the two states involved in the charge recombination process, as described by eqn (2). The anchoring group CAA, which directly adheres to the surface of TiO2, plays a dominant role in determining the electronic coupling between TiO2 and the oxidized dye. The percentage of CAA in the composition of the HOMO of the dye can be regarded as an indicator for evaluating the electronic coupling strength. The weightings of CAA in the HOMOs of dyes 1 and 2 were evaluated and are listed in Table 1. The QHOMO value of 1 is 1.25%, which is 4 times more than the value of 0.25% observed for 2. By using the approach of multistate variation of the fragment charge difference scheme, the calculated electronic couplings reported by Chou et al. were found to be 15.97 and 3.79 meV for dyes 1 and 2, respectively.23 The electronic coupling strength reported in 1 is 4.2 times as large as that reported in 2. Therefore, the percentage of CAA in the composition of the HOMO of the dye is approximately proportional to the electronic coupling.

According to eqn (1), kCR is determined by V2, , and the exponential contribution EXP. To describe kCR quantitatively, Λ and EXP are calculated based on the dye+–TiO2 complexes, and the calculated values are collected in Table 1. The calculated results show that 1 and 2 have almost the same Λ and EXP. The evaluated kCR of 1 is 24 times as fast as that of 2, which demonstrates good agreement of the relative rates with experimental data obtained from ultrafast transient absorption measurements, being 18 and 526 ps for 1 and 2, respectively.21
Our calculated results indicate that QHOMO might be correlated positively with the electronic coupling, which suggests that the weighting of CAA in the composition of the HOMO of the dye should be considered in molecular design in order to suppress charge recombination.
3.2 Light absorption ability
The light absorption property of the sensitizer is a crucial factor in enhancing the short-circuit photocurrent density of the cell. An ideal sensitizer should be associated with a great ability to absorb solar radiation as much as possible in the visible-near-IR range in order to match the solar spectrum. From the analysis of the geometrical structure of 2, we know that the insertion of a phenyl ring will increase the molecular distortion and decrease the π-conjugation of dye 2, thus greatly affecting its light-absorption ability. Herein, we will further investigate the effects of structural modifications on the absorption properties of the dyes by means of TD-DFT calculations. Moreover, we will ascertain the feature of electronic structures associated with the absorption process and provide guidelines for enhancing the light-absorption ability through molecular design.
The simulated absorption spectra of 1 and 2 are presented in Fig. 3. The maximum absorption wavelengths (λmax), oscillator strengths (f), light harvesting efficiencies (ΦLHE) and transition characters of the dyes are collected in Table 2. ΦLHE at maximum absorption wavelength can be calculated as ΦLHE = 1 − 10−f. In order to make a relative comparison of the absorption abilities of dyes 1 and 2, the normalized integrated areas (S) in the absorption spectra from 300 nm to 800 nm were also evaluated by using the S of dye 2 as a reference. The simulated maximum absorption peaks are observed at 570 and 509 nm for 1 and 2, respectively, and are in good agreement with experimental measurements.21 Compared with the spectrum of 1, the calculated spectrum of 2 shows a blue-shifted and relatively stronger maximum absorption peak, which indicates that the introduction of a phenyl ring between BTD and CAA decreases the π-conjugation, but enhances the absorption intensity to some extent. Although 2 has a higher light harvesting efficiency (0.99) at its maximum absorption wavelength in comparison with 1 because of its larger oscillator strength, 2 demonstrates a decreased integrated absorption area compared with that of 1. From the viewpoint of the absorption spectra, our calculated results confirm that the structural change caused by the insertion of a benzene ring in 2 narrows down the absorption spectral range, resulting in a decreased absorption ability. The dye–TiO2 complexes exhibit red-shifted absorption spectra with a high intensity in comparison with those of the dyes.

Both 1 and 2 exhibit common spectral features, which are very strong absorption peaks at long wavelengths (400–800 nm) and relatively weak absorption at short wavelengths (300–400 nm). For a better understanding of the nature of the absorption process, the frontier molecular orbitals of 1 and 2 are depicted in Fig. 4. Apparently, the electron densities of the HOMOs are localized on the TPA and the part of the π-spacer that is adjacent to TPA, while the LUMOs are concentrated on the CAA, BTD and part of the π-bridge. HOMO-1 is spread over the whole molecule. The absorptions at the maximum absorption wavelengths are dominated by the electronic transitions of HOMO → LUMO (from TPA to BTD and CAA) and HOMO-1 → LUMO, for which the spatial separation of the molecular frontier orbital means that there is intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) taking place upon excitation.
 Fig. 4  Spatial distributions of the frontier molecular orbitals for dyes 1 and 2 (saturated H atoms are not shown). 
From the viewpoint of molecular design, in order to enhance the light absorption ability we should extend the π conjugation in order to obtain a red-shifted spectrum, while simultaneously ensuring that the HOMO of the dye is kept away from the CAA unit.
3.3 Molecular design
From the analyses of the electron recombination process and the light-absorbing property of the dye, we know that 2 can effectively slow down the charge recombination rate, thus leading to an improved PCE in spite of its slightly diminished light-absorbing property in comparison to that of 1. On the basis of the molecular structure of 2, the molecular design strategy should maintain its advantage in reducing electron recombination and enhancing its light-absorbing property. By keeping the anchoring group of 2 unchanged, we should be able to enhance the extent of π-conjugation in the π-bridge and TPA. One simple and straightforward approach is through increasing the number of thiophene (T) units (from 2T to 3T or 4T) in order to extend the π-conjugation of the dye. It has been demonstrated that an increase in the number of thiophene units in the π-spacer could be an effective route to obtaining a red-shifted spectrum and broad spectral region.69,70 In order to verify the feasibility of the introduction of more thiophene units, investigations into dyes with three and four thiophene units as π spacers were carried out, and the relevant parameters, such as QHOMO, the light-absorbing properties, and the lifetimes of the first excited states, are collected in Table S3 (ESI†). The calculated results show that an increase in the number of thiophene units results in enhanced light absorption properties in both the red-shifted spectrum and broad spectral range. The calculated QHOMO values are quite small, indicating that the HOMO of the dye is almost not distributed on the CAA unit. However, the calculated LUMO levels of the dyes with 3T and 4T are lower than that of 2 (as depicted in Fig. S2, ESI†), which might result in a decreased electron injection yield.71 Moreover, the calculated lifetime of the excited state S1 also decreases with increasing π-spacer length (as shown in Table S3, ESI†), which is unfavorable for charge injection from the excited state of the dye to the conduction band of TiO2. Therefore, the design strategy of the introduction of more thiophene units as π-bridges is unsuccessful, since the PCE will not be increased any further once the π-spacer exceeds a critical length, which is in agreement with previous experimental and theoretical results.22,72
With the fixed optimal length of the π-bridge (two thiophene units), what we can still do is enhance the molecular planarity by decreasing the dihedral angles between adjacent 5- or 6-member aromatic rings in the π-spacers and TPA. Such rigidification of the molecular skeleton via the covalent immobilization of aromatic rings could suppress the rotational disorder of the molecules, enhance the π-delocalization length, and tune the absorption spectral range of the dyes.73–76 A schematic showing the designed molecules is provided in Fig. 5. The two thiophene units in series A and the benzene and thiophene rings in series B are fastened by C, N and S atoms, while the benzene rings in TPA are connected by C atoms, ethane and ethene in series C. In order to decrease the HOMO distribution on the anchor group, the fastened π-conjugation fragments in the designed molecules were gradually moved away from the CAA units in series A, B and C. In order to further improve the light-harvesting ability of the dyes, we also tried to increase the π-conjugation by connecting the π-bridge and TPA, as is depicted in series D, E and F in Fig. 6. We aim to screen the potential dyes with smaller QHOMO values and stronger light-absorbing abilities.
 Fig. 5  Chemical structures of the designed dyes in series A, B and C with fastened π-conjugation. 
 Fig. 6  Chemical structures of the designed dyes in series D, E and F with increased π-conjugation. 
All of the optimized structures of the designed molecules are shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†). The calculated energy levels of the LUMO and the lifetimes of the excited state S1 for all of the designed dyes are presented in Table S4 (ESI†). Both the LUMO levels and the lifetimes are higher and larger or similar to those of 2, thus ensuring effective charge injection from the excited state of the dye to the conduction band of TiO2. It is worth noting that the molecular modification will also affect the Λ and EXP values which are closely related to the back recombination rate. For that reason, the Λ and EXP values of three representative molecules, A1, B1 and C1, were calculated and are presented in Table S5 (ESI†). The calculated Λ and EXP values are slightly smaller than those of 2. According to eqn (1), a smaller Λ will increase kCR and a smaller EXP will decrease kCR. Therefore, from looking at the integrated results of the Λ and EXP values, those of A1 and B1 are shown to be similar to those of 2 and those of C1 are shown to be smaller than those of 2 (See Table S5, ESI†). We have reason to believe that such a molecular modification will not greatly increase the contribution from Λ and EXP to kCR.
The calculated QHOMO values and the relevant parameters of the absorption spectra of the designed dyes are presented in Table 3. As far as QHOMO is concerned, molecules A1, A2, D1, D2, E3, E4 and F1 exhibit larger QHOMO values than 2, which indicates that those dyes could possibly suffer from detrimental back electron recombination when employed in practical cells. For dyes A1, A2, D1, D2 and F1, the fastened fragments extend their π-conjugation to the CAA group, thus leading to the larger QHOMO values, while for E3 and E4, the TPA fastened with ethane and ethene enhances the electron-donating ability and makes the π-electrons more delocalized, which might be the reason for the increased QHOMO values. In addition to the aforementioned designed molecules, other dyes have similar or slightly larger QHOMO values than 2, indicating that those dyes could have the ability to restrict back electron recombination. It should be noted that A3, B3 and D3, which are immobilized with sulfur atoms, exhibit much smaller QHOMO values than those of the analogous molecules in the same series, which can be attributed to the electron localization caused by the lower HOMO of the S-bridged fragments (as depicted in Fig. S4, ESI†).

In the case of their light absorption abilities, most of the designed dyes demonstrate a red-shifted maximum absorption wavelength and a larger integrated area of the absorption spectra than 2, which indicates that the immobilization of the π-spacers and TPA is a feasible route to extending the π-conjugation and enhancing the light absorption capacity. In the series A, B and D, the spectral area is decreased with the fastening atoms following the order of C > N > S. In comparison with 2, the dyes with C and N as the fastening atom exhibit significantly red-shifted maximum absorption wavelengths and similar or slightly weaker oscillator strengths; while the dyes with S as the fastening atom exhibit similar or even slightly blue-shifted maximum absorption wavelengths and stronger oscillator strengths. From the viewpoint of the dominant absorption transition character, the C- and N-fastened dyes possess more significant intramolecular charge transfer characteristics (a larger percentage of the HOMO → LUMO transition) than the S-fastened dyes, and which dominate the red-shifted spectra (as shown in Table S4, ESI†). Since the ΦLHE values are almost the same for those dyes, the red-shifted spectrum and broad spectral range determine the relative spectral area, which can objectively reflect the dye's light absorption ability. The immobilization of π-spacers and TPA with C atoms could effectively enhance the light-absorption ability of the dye. In the series C and E, the ethene-fastened TPA might be greatly involved in the formation of the frontier orbitals of the dyes, especially in the HOMOs (as shown in Fig. S5, ESI†), thus leading to a more remarkable red-shifted λmax than the ethane- and C-fastened dyes. For example, the λmax wavelengths of C3 and E4 are red-shifted by 19 and 16 nm respectively in comparison to those of C2 and E3. C1 and C2, as well as E1, E2 and E3, exhibit similar spectral features and light-absorption abilities. Dye F1, with a fully fastened TPA and π-spacer, exhibits a red-shifted spectrum and the largest absorption area.
Design rules for potential efficient dyes should comprehensively consider two factors: back electron recombination and light absorption ability. In view of all of the designed dyes, those possessing small QHOMO values and relatively strong absorption spectra should satisfy these requirements. Balancing the two factors, B1, B2, C3, E1 and E2 are shown to be potential promising candidates for application in DSSCs, and might exhibit better cell performance than 2.
4 Conclusions
In summary, we have carried out an in-depth exploration into the relationship between the recombination rate and electronic structure of dyes by means of DFT and TD-DFT calculations. We have analysed the recombination process between electrons in the conduction band of TiO2 and the oxidized dyes of 1 and 2. The light absorption properties of 1 and 2 were investigated in detail. The insertion of a phenyl ring in 2 could block back electron transfer by increasing the distortion of the geometrical structure and decreasing the HOMO distribution on the CAA unit, thus ensuring a slow recombination rate. The small distribution of the HOMO on the anchoring group of the dye could be beneficial for reducing charge recombination, which is a cheap and easily calculated descriptor that we proposed to assist in the molecular design of potential dyes for use in dye-sensitized solar cells. Based on reliable approximations and assumptions, we proposed a molecular design strategy with a comprehensive consideration of both inhibiting recombination and enhancing the light harvesting ability. The immobilization of π-spacers and TPA with C atoms or ethene groups could broaden the spectral range and enhance the light-absorption ability of the dyes. The designed dyes B1, B2, C3, E1 and E2, which demonstrate better spectrum matching with the solar photon-flux spectrum and similar QHOMO values to that of 2, could be promising candidates for applications in DSSCs. These calculations may reflect a trend and offer a basis for the possible further exploration of a series of structurally similar compounds.
