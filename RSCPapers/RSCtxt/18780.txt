    , Accepted 16th January 2023First published on 17th January 2023AbstractMolybdenum disulfide (MoS2), a transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD), is conventionally regarded as a promising room-temperature sensing material due to its unique physical and chemical properties. However, the gas sensors based on pure MoS2 films do not seem to achieve the expectation. In this study, we fabricated the unique structure of dispersed Co and Zn atoms doped on the MoS2/graphite (Co–Zn/MG) composite and investigated the gas-sensing properties. We find that the sensor based on the Co–Zn/MG composite shows high responses toward NO2 gas (Ra/Rg = ∼1.3 at 50 ppb and ∼5.5 at 5 ppm) at room temperature, which is significantly higher than that of the pristine MoS2 sensor in our work. In addition, the Co–Zn/MG sensor has a low limit of detection of 6.2 ppb, fast response–recovery time (118/383 s toward 1 ppm NO2), and long-term stability. Compared with other gases, including NO, NH3, H2, CO, and ethanol, the sensor exhibits good selectivity toward NO2 due to its lower activation energy. Furthermore, the enhanced gas-sensing mechanism can be attributed to the modulation of Schottky barrier height, enriched oxygen adsorption, and catalysis. This work may open a new avenue to achieve NO2 sensors with absolutely competitive performance at room temperature.
1. Introduction
Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a notoriously poisonous and harmful gas and one of the significant air pollution sources, causing acid rain and photochemical smog.1 At present, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) and European Environmental Agency (EEA) specify that the average exposure limit of NO2 within one year cannot exceed 53 ppb and 40 ppb, respectively.2,3 Traditional metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) gas sensors are widely used in commercial applications due to their simple device structures, fast response speed, and low price. However, the MOS gas sensors visibly suffer from the bottlenecks such as poor selectivity and relatively high operating temperature. Therefore, developing a NO2 gas sensor with the expected performance at room temperature (RT) is essential and challenging.
Two-dimensional (2D) materials, like graphene, transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), black phosphorus (BP), and MXenes, are attracting immense attention due to their outstanding physical and chemical properties, such as a tunable bandgap, a high surface-to-volume ratio, a high on/off current ratio, and abundant chemical active sites.4,5 Molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), a typical TMD material, has been widely investigated in various applications, including photodetectors, solar cells, field-effect transistors (FETs), and RT gas sensors.6–8 First, MoS2 exhibits a hexagonal phase with ABAB stacking (2H phase), where the S–Mo–S atoms are covalently bonded into layers.9 Then, Ellis et al. found that MoS2 had a tunable band gap of 1.2 (bulk) to 1.83 eV (monolayer).10 Radisavljevic et al. demonstrated that the mobility of single-layer MoS2 at RT was up to 200 cm2 V−1 s−1 with a large current on/off ratio.11 Currently, the research efforts of MoS2 high-performance gas sensors operating at RT are mainly focused on surface modification and van der Waals heterostructures. For instance, Zhou et al. reported UV light-activated NO2 gas-sensing based on the Au nanoparticle-decorated few-layer MoS2 thin film, which showed the response of 10% toward 2.5 ppm NO2.12 Jaiswal et al. fabricated the sensor based on the p-CdTe-decorated n-MoS2 hybrid heterostructure, which showed the excellent response of 40% and fast response and recovery times compared to the pristine MoS2 sensor.13 Zheng et al. found that the MoS2 p–n junction sensor exhibited the outstanding sensitivity and selectivity toward NO2 under UV illumination and a low limit of detection (LOD) at the ppb level.14 However, the challenge of further improving the performance of MoS2-based gas sensors still exists.
Recently, single-atom catalysts (SACs), owing to their high atom utilization efficiencies, significant selectivity, and high stability, have attracted tremendous attention in water splitting,15 ORR,16 HER,17 and CO2RR.18 Compared with those conventional noble metals, Co and Zn atoms are inexpensive and show excellent catalytic properties.19,20 Therefore, there are also some works of Co or Zn SACs on gas sensors with the enhancement of selectivity operating at RT.21,22 However, the atomic dispersion SACs lacking stronger synergistic effects may not extend the performance of SAC sensors. In contrast, the dual-atom catalysts (DACs) with stronger atomic interaction and enhanced synergistic effects23,24 are expected to improve the performance of gas sensors further.
In this work, we fabricated MoS2/graphite (MG) composites with dispersed Co or Zn atoms in three ways (i.e., Co-doped MG, Zn-doped MG, and binary Co/Zn-doped MG) via a simple chemical synthesis method. A series of characterization techniques were performed to explore the pristine MoS2 and the above three composites. In addition, their gas-sensing performance has been systematically investigated. It was found that the Co–Zn/MG sensor was ultrasensitive toward NO2 gas even at ppb-level concentrations at RT and had fast response–recovery time and long-term stability, which is significantly better than that of the pristine MoS2 sensor and superior to most of the previous reports. In addition, the enhanced gas-sensing mechanism has also been discussed.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Step 1: Synthesis of dispersed Co and Zn atoms
All chemicals were purchased from Macklin Reagent unless otherwise specified. The detailed fabrication process is described in Scheme 1. Herein, the synthesis of dispersed Zn atoms is taken as an example. First, dicyandiamide (C2H4N4, 20 g) was heated to 350 °C at a heating rate of 7 °C min−1 and kept in Ar atmosphere for 1 h, denoted as DCD. Second, 10 mg of zinc(II) acetylacetonate was added to 5 ml of ethanol solution (50% distilled water with 10 mg ml−1 citric acid), followed by high-power ultrasonication for 30 min. Then, the above solution was dropped into DCD (Zn with a total content of 1 wt% vs. DCD, 10 g of DCD) and ball-milled for 5 h. The mixture was annealed at 680 °C for 2 h with an Ar flow rate of 50 sccm. The obtained black powder was the dispersed Zn atoms. The dispersed Co atoms were also prepared in the same way except for the precursor of cobalt(II) acetylacetonate.

2.2. Step 2: Synthesis of the Co–Zn/MG composite
The poly ethylenimine (PEI) solution (1 ml, 50% (w/v) in H2O) and polyvinyl pyridine (PVP) (50 mg, average mol 58000) were dissolved in 10 ml of ethanol solution to modify the MoS2 surface. Then, 20 mg of MoS2 (from Macklin Reagent) was dispersed in the above solution. The dispersed Co and Zn atoms (with a total content of 10 wt% vs. MoS2, 1 mg of Co atoms, and 1 mg of Zn atoms) were added to the above solution and ultrasonicated for 30 min. The mixture was magnetically stirred for 2 h, dried, and ball-milled for 5 h. Afterward, the prepared powder was transferred to the growth furnace, heated to 680 °C, and kept for 2 h. Finally, the dispersed binary Co–Zn atoms doped on MG composites could be obtained, noted as Co–Zn/MG. All the annealing processes were performed in Ar atmosphere, with a flow rate of 50 sccm. Other metal-doped MG composites (i.e., Co/MG and Zn/MG) were also prepared similarly.
2.3. Materials characterization
The morphology of different metal-doped MG composites was investigated using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM, JEOL model JEM-2100F) and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, Hitachi, Regulus 8230), respectively. Atomic resolution imaging was performed on a Cs-corrected transmission electron microscope (JEOL ARM-200F) operating in a scanning mode (STEM) at 200 kV. Raman spectra were recorded on an HR Evolution Raman spectrometer (Horiba Jobin Yvon) equipped with a laser excitation of 532 nm. X-ray diffraction (XRD, Cu Kα radiation, λ = 1.5418 Å) analysis in the 2θ range of 5° to 70° was performed using a Bruker X-ray diffractometer. The elemental mapping was analyzed by HRTEM equipped with an energy-dispersive spectroscope (EDS). The chemical state information of the different metal-doped MG composites was determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, ESCALAB 250Xi, Thermo, USA), with Al Kα (1486.6 eV) as the X-ray radiation.
2.4. Sensors fabrication and gas sensing measurements
First, the sensing materials were ground into powder, a little ethanol was added, and then they were mixed well. Second, these sensing materials were coated on the Au interdigital electrodes for better contact (Scheme 1) and dried in an oven at 60 °C for 10 min. The gas-sensing performance was measured by an intelligent gas-sensing platform with high-purity dry air (HPDA) as the background gas (see Scheme S1 in the ESI†). Before the sensing measurements, a sensor was placed in the sensing chamber and purged with HPDA until a stable resistance was obtained. During the measurements, the target gases and HPDA were mixed in a mixing chamber at the desired concentrations and then passed into the sensing chamber for a response process. Only HPDA flowed in for a recovery process when the response reached saturation. Here, the response of the sensors is defined as S = Ra/Rg or S = Rg/Ra for oxidizing and reducing gases, respectively, where Ra is the baseline resistance of the sensors in HPDA, and Rg is the resistance of the sensors in a detected gas. In addition, the dynamic resistance of the sensors was sampled every second. The response time τres is defined as the time for the sensors to reach 90% of S upon exposure to a target gas, and the recovery time τrec is defined as the time for the sensors to recover to 10% of S after purging with HPDA.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Characterization of the sensing materials
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) technique was utilized to investigate the crystalline structures of the pristine MoS2, Co/MG, Zn/MG, and Co–Zn/MG composites, respectively. From Fig. 1(a), the dominant peaks at 14.4°, 33.0°, 39.5°, 44.2°, 49.6°, 58.3°, and 60.2° correspond to the (002), (100), (103), (006), (105), (110), and (008) crystal planes of 2H-MoS2 (JCPDS card No. 37-1492), respectively.25 The peak at 26.1° corresponds to the (002) plane of graphite generated during the annealing process of MoS2 after PVP and PEI surface modifications.19 Then, Raman spectroscopy was also implemented to investigate the structures of the as-prepared samples. As shown in Fig. 1(b), the two dominant peaks at 379.5 and 404.9 cm−1 are indexed to the E12g and A1g modes of the 2H-MoS2 crystal, where the E12g and A1g modes represent the in-plane and out-of-plane vibrations of S atoms, respectively.26 In addition, all the annealed samples (i.e., Co–Zn/MG, Co/MG, and Zn/MG) have distinct D and G peaks of carbon at 1337 and 1584 cm−1 with the intensity ratio of ID to IG close to 1:1.19 In contrast, the D and G peaks do not appear in the Raman spectrum of the pristine MoS2, which is consistent with the XRD analysis (Fig. 1(a)).

More information on the surface morphology and the crystal structure of the Co–Zn/MG composite was obtained via FESEM and HRTEM, respectively. The SEM image in Fig. 2(a) indicates that the Co–Zn/MG composite mainly exists in the nanosheet structure. The high-resolution images shown in Fig. 2(b) and (c) illustrate that the lattice fringes with the interplanar spacings of 0.27 nm and 0.35 nm match well with the (100) crystal plane of the MoS2 and the (002) crystal plane of the graphite, respectively.9,27 The corresponding fast Fourier transform (FFT) pattern of MoS2 (the inset of Fig. 2(c)) shows the sharp reflection characteristics of 2H-MoS2.28 In addition, the HAADF-STEM characterization and energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) elemental mapping were performed to gain more insight into the role played by Co and Zn atoms anchored on the MoS2 surface. Fig. 2(d) shows that some small white dots (circled in red) with a bright contrast seem to be dispersed on the MoS2 surface, as suggested by the intensity profile shown in Fig. 2(e). The corresponding intensity profile of the selected line in Fig. 2(d) shows that the spots with different intensities on the MoS2 surface correspond to the Mo, S, Co, and Zn planes, respectively, where the combination of Co (or Zn) and Mo atoms, (i.e., Co–Mo or Zn–Mo) exhibits higher intensity compared with the Mo and S atoms. From Fig. 2(h), the corresponding elemental mapping in different colors shows the uniform distributions of C, S, Mo, Zn, and Co elements, indicating the presence of tiny amounts of Co and Zn atoms in the ratio of about 1:1 in the composition. More information about the surface morphology and structural analysis of the pristine MoS2, Co/MG, and Zn/MG composites can be seen in Fig. S1–S3 in the ESI.†

XPS was performed to confirm the chemical state of the as-prepared composites. The XPS survey shown in Fig. 3(a) reveals the presence of C, Mo, S, and O in all composites, and the peaks of Co 2p or Zn 2p can be observed in the doped composites. Fig. 3(b) shows that the first three peaks at 226.6, 229.6, and 232.7 eV correspond to S 2s, Mo+4 3d5/2, and Mo+4 3d3/2, respectively. The fourth peak at 236.3 eV in the doped composites corresponds to Mo+6 3d3/2 due to the marginal conversion of MoS2 to MoO3 on their surfaces at a high temperature during the annealing process.29 In Fig. 3(c), the two distinct peaks at 162.2 and 163.4 eV can be assigned to S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2 of S2−, respectively. The XPS spectra of O 1s in Fig. 3(d) exhibit three deconvoluted peaks at 530.6 eV (lattice oxygen (Olatt)), 532.0 eV (adsorbed oxygen (Oads)), and 533.5 eV (hydroxyl groups (OH−)) on the MoS2 surface.30,31 The peak area of Oads in Co–Zn/MG is larger than that of the Zn/MG, Co/MG composites, and pristine MoS2, indicating that the dominance of Oads on the Co–Zn/MG surface may contribute to the improved gas-sensing performance, which will be discussed later. Moreover, Fig. 3(e) illustrates the Co chemical state of Co–Zn/MG, where the Co 2p spectrum can be fitted as two spin–orbit bimodal peaks, and the main peaks at 778.4 and 794.1 eV can be attributed to Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2 of Co2+, respectively. As shown in Fig. 3(f), the peaks located at 1021.4 and 1044.5 eV correspond to Zn 2p3/2 and Zn 2p1/2 of Zn2+ for Co–Zn/MG, respectively. Furthermore, the deconvoluted C 1s spectrum shown in Fig. S4(a) (ESI†) exhibits a distinct peak at 284.6 eV (C–C) and two weak peaks at 285.3 eV (C–O) and 287.2 eV (CO).32 The full width at half maximum (FWHM) and peak area of three functional groups of the doped composites are larger than those in pristine MoS2, implying the incorporation of a new carbon source (i.e., graphite), which is consistent with the XRD and Raman results (Fig. 1). By further analysis of the Co element in Co/MG (Fig. S4(b), ESI†), the peaks of Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2 at 780.5 and 795.5 eV are consistent with the formation of Co–O bonds, possibly giving rise to CoO.33 In contrast, the peaks of Zn 2p3/2 and Zn 2p1/2 of Zn/MG in Fig. S4(c) (ESI†) are at 1021.3 and 1044.3 eV, respectively, which are very close to the data of Co–Zn/MG. Therefore, through high-resolution XPS analysis, it seems that Co/MG is prone to oxidization compared with the Co–Zn/MG and Zn/MG samples. That is why the Olatt peak area of Co/MG is much larger than that of other composites (Fig. 3(d)).

3.2. Gas sensing performance
The gas-sensing performance of the sensors based on the pristine MoS2 and different metal-doped MG composites toward NO2 at RT has been investigated. As shown in Fig. 4(a), the response of the Co–Zn/MG sensor toward 5 ppm NO2 is 5.5, which is higher than that of the sensors based on Zn/MG (3.7), Co/MG (3.2), and pristine MoS2 (1.9). Fig. 4(b) illustrates the dynamic gas-sensing performance of the Co–Zn/MG sensor at the low concentrations of 0.05 to 5 ppm and that the extent of decrease becomes intense as the concentration of NO2 increases. The decrease in resistance of the sensor toward the oxidizing gas NO2 may imply the p-type semiconductor behavior. Since the scattering effect of gas molecules adsorbed on the surface leads to a decrease in carrier mobility, the sensor response vs. concentration has been fitted into two linear functions with the NO2 concentration ranging from 0.05 to 0.3 ppm and 0.3 to 5 ppm, as shown in Fig. 4(c). This phenomenon also occurs in the previous works.34,35 In addition, the theoretical LOD of the sensor is calculated using the IUPAC procedure:36, where the root-mean-square (rms) value of the response noise is about 0.39%, and the slope of the linear fitting data at the gas concentration of 0.05 to 0.3 ppm (the inset of Fig. 4(c)) is about 1.89 ppm−1. Then, the theoretically calculated LOD is approximately 6.2 ppb. Note that the experimentally measured LOD (limited by the gas mixture system) value of the sensor toward NO2 is as low as 50 ppb (Fig. S5(b), ESI†), which can be comparable with the allowable value issued by EEA. Fig. 4(d) shows that the response and recovery times of the Co–Zn/MG sensor toward 5 ppm NO2 are approximately 150 and 471 s, respectively. In contrast, at a lower NO2 concentration of 1 ppm, the response and recovery times are reduced to 118 and 383 s, as shown in Fig. S5(a) (ESI†). To evaluate the repeatability of the sensor, four response–recovery cycles were implemented toward 1 ppm NO2, as shown in Fig. 4(e). The sensor also exhibits similar repeatability at the lower NO2 concentration of 50 ppb (Fig. S5(b), ESI†). It can be seen that these response–recovery curves maintain nearly the same amplitude and period, exhibiting satisfied repeatability. The long-term stability was conducted at RT for 50 days with a 5-day sampling. As shown in Fig. 4(f), the resistance and response of the Co–Zn/MG sensor toward 1 ppm NO2 remain in the relatively constant state during the whole period, indicating the good long-term stability of the sensor.

Response (left) and baseline resistance (right) of the sensor. 
Then, the selectivity of the Co–Zn/MG sensor was also researched by comparing the responses toward six widely used gases, such as 50 ppm NH3, 5 ppm NO, 100 ppm H2, 50 ppm CO, and 50 ppm ethanol. As shown in Fig. 5(a), the responses of the Co–Zn/MG sensor toward the above gases are approximately 1.74, 1.51, 1.25, 1.16, and 1.18, respectively, much smaller than that of 5 ppm NO2 (5.5). The reason for the good selectivity of the Co–Zn/MG sensor toward NO2 will be addressed later. In addition, the gas sensing performance of the Co–Zn/MG sensor is also compared with that of gas sensors based on other emerging sensing materials (structures) for NO2 at RT or low operating temperatures. As shown in Table 1, the performance of our sensor is superior to most of the sensors based on conventional 2D materials or their hybrid materials with nano-metal oxides or heterojunctions, especially in terms of response and LOD. The performance of the sensor is even comparable to that of the gas sensors with the aid of UV light, indicating that the sensing material based on Co–Zn/MG composites may be promising for practical applications in detecting NO2 at low concentrations.

Based on the pseudo-first-order equation (eqn (1)),51 the reaction rate (k) of the Co–Zn/MG sensor to a target gas at a determined concentration at an operating temperature (T) was first calculated. Then, combined with the Arrhenius equation (eqn (2)), the selectivity of the Co–Zn/MG sensor can be demonstrated by comparing the activation energy (Ea) for the six target gases mentioned above.52 ln(Se − St) = lnSe − kt(1)k = Ae−Ea/kBT (2)where Se and St are the sensing response at adsorption equilibrium and at a certain time t (normally less than tres), respectively. A is a constant and kB is the Boltzmann constant.
The detailed reaction rates of the sensor for the above gases have been listed in Table S1 (ESI†). The Arrhenius linear graphs between the reaction rate of the sensor (lnk) and operating temperature  are plotted in Fig. 5. From Fig. 5(b–g), the Ea values of the Co–Zn/MG sensor toward 5 ppm NO2, 5 ppm NO, 50 ppm NH3, 100 ppm H2, 50 ppm CO, and 50 ppm ethanol are approximately 0.093, 0.112, 0.198, 0.181, 0.130, and 0.158 kJ mol−1, respectively. The activation energy of the Co–Zn/MG sensor for NO2 gas is smaller than other gases. In general, the lower the activation energy, the easier the reaction and the higher the gas response. Therefore, the Co–Zn/MG sensor has a promising selectivity for NO2 gas.


3.3.2. Gas sensing mechanism. 
In fact, for the gas-sensing mechanism of the chemiresistive gas sensors, the surface reaction between the target gas molecules and pre-adsorbed ionized oxygen species plays a vital role in most cases.53,54 As for the Co–Zn/MG sensor, the heterostructure effect from the interface between MoS2 and graphite should also be considered. Compared with the pristine MoS2, graphite is a narrow bandgap semiconductor and renders semimetal-like transport properties.55,56 Moreover, the current–voltage curves (Fig. S6, ESI†) of the Co–Zn/MG sensor also show the nonlinear characteristics under different atmospheres. Thus, the effective Schottky contact at the MG interface has been formed, and due to the different work functions between MoS2 (5.22 eV)12 and graphite (4.6 eV),57 the energy band profile at the interface of the MG heterojunction in air is shown in Fig. 6(b). As displayed in eqn (3), when the Co–Zn/MG sensor is exposed to air at RT, ambient oxygen molecules can be adsorbed on the surface of the sensor and capture free electrons from the conduction band of Co–Zn/MG to form adsorbed negative oxygen species (i.e., O2−). When the sensor is exposed to NO2, which is more preferred to act as electron acceptors than oxygen so that NO2 molecules can not only capture electrons directly from the conduction band of Co–Zn/MG but also further obtain electrons from the pre-adsorbed oxygen species (O2−), as interpreted in eqn (4) and (5).58 Combined with the response results of the Co–Zn/MG sensor, the holes of MoS2 near the valence band maximum (VBM) may play a dominant role in transport properties. Therefore, as illustrated in Fig. 6(d), a large number of electrons are transferred from the MoS2 surface to the NO2 molecules, resulting in a downward shift of the Fermi level of MoS2 closer to the VBM and a decrease in the height of the effective Schottky barrier (∅SB). Since the resistance of the heterostructures is an exponential function of ∅SB,59 the response of the heterostructure-type sensors is normally larger than that of the sensors based on their single and respective pure material. O2(gas) + e− → O2−(ads)(3) NO2(gas) + e− → NO2−(ads)(4) NO2(gas) + O2− + 2e− → NO2−(ads) + 2O−(ads)(5)

In addition, the binary Co–Zn doping greatly promotes the adsorption of O2, which is confirmed by O 1s XPS analysis (Fig. 3(d)). As shown in eqn (5), more adsorbed oxygen makes NO2 on the surface of the Co–Zn/MG sensor gain more electrons, resulting in a higher response. Therefore, the enhanced electron transfer between the adsorbed oxygen species and NO2 gas also contributes to the improvement of gas-sensing performance. Although eqn (4) and (5) coexist, more pre-adsorbed oxygen species may relatively weaken the process of eqn (4). Such mechanism models have been explored by many previous works.58,60 Furthermore, for the Co–Zn/MG sensor, the dual atomic synergetic effects of the binary Co–Zn atoms on the MoS2 surface need to be considered, which may act as powerful catalysts to reduce the activation energy compared to the Co/MG, Zn/MG composites, and pristine MoS2.30,31


3.3.3. Humidity effect. 
From the practical application perspective, gas sensors operating at RT are particularly susceptible to humidity. Therefore, the influence of relative humidity (RH) on the performance of the gas sensors must be considered. Here, we measured the responses of the Co–Zn/MG sensor toward 1 ppm NO2 gas at different RH levels at RT. The stable RHs (20%, 40%, 51%, 66%, 78%, and 83%) are obtained by adjusting the mass flow ratios of dry and humid gases shown in Scheme S1 (ESI†). Fig. 7(a) shows the dynamic gas-sensing performance of the Co–Zn/MG sensor toward 1 ppm NO2 at different RH levels. From Fig. 7(b), with the increase of RH, the baseline resistance of the sensor first increases and then decreases. The response of the sensor also exhibits the same trend; particularly when the RH is higher than 70%, the response of the sensor decreases obviously and is eventually stabilized. In the presence of water vapor in air, two charge transfer processes occurring on the surface of MoS2 could be implemented to explain the effect of humidity:61,62 e− + O2 → O2−(6) O2− + H2O → HO2* + OH−(7)where e− is an electron, O2− is the adsorbed oxygen molecules, and HO2* and OH− are the hydroperoxyl radical and hydroxyl groups, respectively. The water molecules adsorbed on the surface of Co–Zn/MG can act as electron donors.63,64 Since Co–Zn/MG is a p-type semiconductor, an increase in humidity leads to a decrease in the concentration of the main carrier (holes), which ultimately leads to the increase in the baseline resistance of the sensor. However, with the humidity gradually increasing, the ion-conductivity of water molecules may contribute to decreasing the baseline resistance.65 In addition, according to Choi et al., the hydroxyl group (OH−) on the MoS2 surface may increase the adsorption energy between MoS2 and NO2,66 thus promoting the response toward NO2 in the presence of water vapor. However, with the increased humidity, the excessive water molecules adsorbed on the MoS2 surface will occupy some sensing active sites, decreasing the response.

4. Conclusions
In summary, a high-performance gas sensor was designed and fabricated by doping binary Co–Zn atoms into the MG composite via a chemical synthesis method with the strategy of the surface procedure. The detailed characterization results show that the binary Co–Zn atoms are anchored on the MoS2 surface to form a stable structure. Moreover, the gas-sensing performance of the sensor based on Co–Zn/MG toward NO2 at RT is significantly improved compared to that of the pristine MoS2 sensor, which is mainly reflected in the response as much as 2.9 times, the LOD of merely 6.2 ppb, and good selectivity. Therefore, the sensor based on Co–Zn/MG may have a promising application in detecting low-concentration NO2 at RT. Furthermore, as a heuristic platform for new gas-sensing materials, doping binary non-noble metals (i.e., Co, Zn, Ni, etc.) into the 2D TMD composites may need more attention.
