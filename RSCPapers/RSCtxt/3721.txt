With our optimized interfacial modification, we demonstrated efficient PHJ perovskite solar cells with a high PCE of 12.2% using a sol–gel-processed ZnO ECL modified by [6,6]-phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM).
The recent tremendous progress in thin-film solar cell technology using solution-processable organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites – such as CH3NH3PbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I) – is an important milestone in the field of renewable solar devices.1–6 Because hybrid organic–inorganic methylammonium lead halide perovskites exhibit excellent semiconducting properties, such as high charge-carrier mobility (∼10 cm2 V−1 s−1), a direct band gap (∼1.5 eV), a broad absorption range, a small exciton binding energy (∼20 meV), and a long-range exciton diffusion length (100–1000 nm), the new family of solar cells incorporating hybrid light-harvesting materials is expected to achieve power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of up to 20% in the near future.4,6 Motivated by the great potential of organometal halide perovskites, intensive studies have been conducted on the charge dynamics of perovskites,5,6 synthesis of new materials,7 optimization of perovskite absorber layers by increasing crystallinity4,8 and surface coverage,9 and realization of low-temperature processed devices10–12 over the past several years.
Recently, studies on planar-heterojunction (PHJ) perovskite solar cells, sandwiched between the hole transport layer (HTL) and the electron collection layer (ECL) without mesoporous scaffolds, have attracted much attention due to their simplified fabrication process and compatibility with roll-to-roll processing on flexible substrates.1,8 To realize the PHJ perovskite solar cells, several nano-sized TiO2 or ZnO nanoparticles (NPs) have been used as compact ECLs in the devices.3 However, the NPs are usually synthesized by relatively complex procedures including long reaction time, precipitation, washing, and dilution processes.13 In addition, ligand-linked NPs need a high temperature annealing process, which is incompatible with flexible substrates, and ligand-free NPs usually suffer from poor dispersion stability.14,15 In contrast, sol–gel processed metal oxides have many advantages of simple synthesis, long-term stability, solution, and low temperature processability and are more suitable for printable photovoltaics.16
Nevertheless, there are few reports to successfully demonstrate efficient PHJ perovskite solar cells by incorporating the sol–gel metal oxides. In addition, although the interfacial engineering of the interface between electrodes and the light absorber films has been one of the most important strategies for improving the PCEs of thin-film solar cells, only a few reports on this method in the field of PHJ perovskite solar cells have been published. Therefore, the aim of this work was to replace the complicated NPs with simple sol–gel compact ECLs and to study the effect of the interfacial modification of the sol–gel processed ECLs on device performance by analyzing the electronic structures of the interfacial layers and the perovskite absorber for optimizing the device performance of PHJ perovskite solar cells.
In this communication, we successfully demonstrate efficient PHJ perovskite solar cells with a sol–gel processed ZnO ECL modified by a thin organic surface modifier, [6,6]-phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM). By depositing PCBM onto sol–gel ZnO, the electronic structure of ZnO could be modulated, and the Voc values of the devices containing ZnO/PCBM were enhanced compared to those of the devices containing only ZnO. In addition, the interfacial modification of ZnO was observed to significantly reduce trap-assisted charge recombination at the interface of ZnO as well as in the bulk of the perovskite absorber, thereby improving the device performance. With our optimized interfacial modification, we demonstrated efficient PHJ perovskite solar cells with a PCE of 12.2% using a sol–gel-processed ZnO/PCBM ECL.

Fig. 1a illustrates the device architecture of the PHJ perovskite solar cells and the chemical structures of the organic interfacial modifier PCBM used in this work. The device structure is ITO/ZnO/CH3NH3PbI3/PTB7-Th/MoO3/Ag, where the perovskite film (CH3NH3PbI3) was grown using a sequential deposition method to achieve good film coverage and crystallization (see ESI S1†).2 The results of a structural investigation of PbI2 and CH3NH3PbI3 using a selected area electron diffraction (SAED) clearly show that the phase of PbI2 (hexagonally close-packed layer) was successfully transformed into the perovskite structure of CH3NH3PbI3 (see ESI S2†).

A cross-sectional SEM image of the device is also shown. Energy-level diagram of the components of the perovskite solar cells (b) without and (c) with PCBM. The energy-level offset (ΔEoff) is the energy-level difference between the quasi Fermi levels of the electron collection layer and the hole transport layer. 
To selectively extract electrons from the CH3NH3PbI3 absorber, a 30 nm-thick sol–gel-processed ZnO layer was deposited onto the ITO electrode as the ECL. The sol–gel ZnO film offers several advantages including easy solution processability, air stability, excellent optical transparency, good film formation, and relatively low-temperature processability. Furthermore, because sol–gel ZnO has much higher electron mobility than that of titanium oxide, it is an ideal material as an ECL for the PHJ perovskite solar cells.16 For the interfacial modification of the top surface of the ZnO layer, PCBM was spin-coated onto the ZnO film and then annealed at 80 °C for 5 min. Because the fullerene derivative of PCBM is an excellent electron acceptor having a favorable electronic structure with respect to the perovskite absorber, it is expected that the modifiers can effectively modulate the interfacial properties of ZnO.17 Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements show that the ZnO and the ZnO/PCBM films have a very smooth and compact morphology (Fig. S3 and S4†).
In our perovskite solar cells, we utilized a new class of PBDTTT-type low-band-gap conjugated polymers composed of benzodithiophene (BDT) and thieno[3,4-b]thiophene (TT) units, PTB7-Th, as a HTL.18 Because the PTB7-Th layer has an excellent hole mobility of 1.5 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1 as well as an appropriate oxidation potential of 5.2 eV, it is expected to function efficiently as a HTL in perovskite solar cells (see ESI S5†). More detailed information regarding the preparation of the perovskite absorber, sol–gel ZnO, and PTB7-Th and the device fabrication is described in the Experimental section.
The energy-level diagrams of the component materials and the effect of ZnO interfacial modification are illustrated in Fig. 1b and c, respectively. The valence band maximum (VBM) values of the ZnO and the perovskite films were determined by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS), and the conduction band minimum (CBM) values were calculated by adding the optical band gap (Eg) derived from the UV-visible absorption onset (Fig. S6†). The spectroscopic measurements show that the ZnO film has a VBM of 6.89 eV and a CBM of 3.69 eV, respectively. The electronic structure of PTB7-Th was obtained from the literature.18 Because the CBM (3.60 eV) and VBM (5.20 eV) of the perovskite film are close to those of the ZnO and PTB7-Th layers, respectively, the efficient charge extraction (or dissociation) of free charge carriers (or excitons) generated in the perovskite film is expected, as shown in Fig. 1b. It is noteworthy that a stable molybdenum oxide (MoOx) thin film was deposited on top of the PTB7-Th HTL in our perovskite solar cells. Because the TMO interlayer helps to extract holes more efficiently, we obtained a dramatically enhanced device performance by introducing the MoOx interlayer (see ESI Fig. S7†). The role of the MoOx layer is to reduce contact resistance at the interface of the HTL and the Ag electrode by hole-doping of the organic HTL with the MoOx.19,20 Therefore, we expect that various new types of organic materials can be successfully applied to perovskite solar cells as efficient HTLs by combining them with a MoOx interlayer.
To enhance the efficiency of perovskite solar cells, improving the electron transport/extraction is also very important. Therefore, we intended to modify the surface of the ZnO film by incorporating PCBM for better electron transport/extraction between the ZnO and the perovskite absorber. In addition, as shown in Fig. 1c, because the Voc of the ‘p–i–n’ perovskite solar cells is usually determined by the energy-level offset (ΔEoff) between the quasi Fermi levels of the ECL and the HTL adjacent to the perovskite absorber,21,22 it is expected that an enhancement in the Voc values is possible by changing the electronic structure of the ZnO film using a surface modifier, thereby improving the device performance.
To investigate the electronic structures of ZnO and ZnO/PCBM, we carried out ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) measurements. Fig. 2a shows the UPS spectra of the ITO, ZnO, ZnO/PCBM, and ZnO/perovskite films. The photoemission parameters obtained from the UPS measurements are summarized in Table S1.† The high binding energy onset of bare ITO is 16.82 eV, yielding a work function (WF) of 4.38 eV. The deposition of a ZnO film on the ITO substrate leads to a shift in the photoemission onset toward higher binding energy (17.41 eV), indicating the formation of an interfacial dipole shifting the vacuum level upward, and the WF decreases to 3.79 eV. The photoemission onset of the ZnO film further shifts toward higher binding energy upon the deposition of PCBM, decreasing the WF to 3.74 eV. In contrast, the valence band edge (Evalence) of the ZnO film shifts toward lower binding energy with interfacial modification, shifting the energetic position of the VBM upward with respect to the Fermi level (EF).

(b) Energy-level diagrams of the various films resulting from the UPS studies. The Fermi level (EF) values of each film are aligned due to the thermodynamic equilibrium that arises when they are joined together. 
The electronic structures of the ITO, ZnO, ZnO/PCBM, and ZnO/perovskite films deduced from the UPS measurements are illustrated in Fig. 2b. The EF values of each film are aligned due to thermodynamic equilibrium when they are joined together; band bending is not shown. Because the CBM of ZnO is lower than that of perovskite, the efficient charge extraction (or dissociation) of free charge carriers (or excitons) generated in the perovskite film is expected. For the ZnO/PCBM ECL, because the CBM of ZnO/PCBM is located between that of ZnO and that of perovskite, much more favorable energy-level alignment occurs at the interfaces, facilitating cascade charge extraction. In addition, the high voltage output of the perovskite solar cell with the ZnO/PCBM layer is expected due to the large energy-level offset between the quasi Fermi levels of the ECL and the HTL adjacent to the perovskite absorber relative to that afforded by ZnO alone.
To explore the effects of interfacial modification on device performance, we fabricated PHJ perovskite solar cells with a structure of ITO/sol–gel ZnO/CH3NH3PbI3/PTB7-Th/MoO3/Ag and ITO/sol–gel ZnO/PCBM/CH3NH3PbI3/PTB7-Th/MoO3/Ag. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the devices under AM 1.5 G irradiation with an irradiation intensity of 100 mW cm−2 and external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra are shown in Fig. 3a and b, respectively. The photovoltaic parameters of these devices are summarized in Table 1. As shown in Fig. 3a, the device with a sol–gel ZnO film exhibited a PCE of 8.37% with a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 14.31 mA cm−2, an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.86 V, and a fill factor (FF) of 68%. The performances are comparable to those of perovskite solar cells incorporating ZnO NPs which were synthesized by a previously reported method3 (see ESI Fig. S8†).

On the other hand, the perovskite solar cells containing sol–gel ZnO/PCBM showed remarkably enhanced device performance compared with that of the ZnO devices, resulting in the best PCE of 11.04% with Jsc ∼ 15.10 mA cm−2, Voc ∼ 1.03 V, and FF ∼ 71%. Notably, the Voc and FF values were further enhanced relative to those of the of ZnO devices. As indicated by the electronic structure of the films (see Fig. 2), the enhancement in the device performance can be attributed to the following factors: the larger energy-level offset between the quasi Fermi levels of the ECL and the HTL adjacent to the perovskite absorber and the more favorable energy-level alignment between the CBM of ZnO/PCBM and the perovskite absorber for efficient electron collection, resulting in a high FF. When considering that the perovskite solar cells incorporating only PCBM on the ITO substrate exhibited poor device performances (see ESI Fig. S9†), the synergic effect of ZnO and PCBM is crucial for improving the device performance.
To further investigate the role of interfacial modification in enhancing the performance of the fabricated devices, we measured the light-intensity dependence of Voc for the perovskite solar cells with ZnO and ZnO/PCBM ECLs, which describes the order of recombination processes in solar devices (see ESI Fig. S10†).23,24Fig. 4a shows a semi-logarithmic plot of Voc as a function of light intensity for the devices and the slopes derived from the lines fitted linearly to the data. As shown in Fig. 4a, the device with only ZnO shows a strong dependence of Voc on the light intensity, with a slope of 4.10kBT/q, where kB is Boltzmann's constant, q is the elementary charge, and T is temperature in Kelvin. However, when ZnO is modified with PCBM, the device shows a lower slope of 3.49kBT/q, indicating reduced trap-assisted recombination in the devices.17,25 The slope of our perovskite solar cells is similar to previously reported values of CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite devices but slightly higher than that of mixed halide (CH3NH3PbI3−xClx) perovskite solar cells.26–28 We speculate that the differences can be related to perovskite composition, because the exciton diffusion length and charge dynamics were significantly affected by doping Cl ions into CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite.6,29

(b) Recombination resistance at different applied biases extracted from IS characterization of the perovskite solar cells. 
It is noted that the slopes of the CH3NH3PbI3-based PHJ perovskite solar cells are relatively larger than those of polymer solar cells (PSCs) (∼kBT/q) and solid-state, dye-sensitized solar cells (SDSSCs) (∼1.7kBT/q); this finding suggests that the dominant charge recombination mechanism of the perovskite solar cells at the open-circuit voltage is monomolecular recombination, which is distinguished from bimolecular recombination in PSCs and a combination of monomolecular and bimolecular recombination in SDSSCs at the open-circuit voltage.30,31
Monomolecular recombination, also referred to as Shockley–Read–Hall (SRH) recombination, is a first-order recombination process in which electrons and holes recombine through trap sites in the bulk of an absorber or at interfaces in devices.31,32 By surface modification using the fullerene derivative, we expect that the trap sites in the ZnO film were significantly reduced, thereby enhancing the device performance. Although the trap-filling mechanism is not clearly understood at this moment, we speculate that there are some charge transfer reactions that occur from PCBM to ZnO due to the difference in the WF or a chemical interaction that fills the trap sites in the ZnO.18,33 To further reveal the trap-filling mechanism is beyond the scope of this work, and study of the mechanism is underway in our laboratory.
The charge recombination processes were also investigated by extracting the recombination resistance (Rrec) from impedance spectroscopy (IS) measurements of the perovskite solar cells. Generally, the features observed in the low-frequency region in the IS spectra are closely related to charge recombination processes, and the Rrec is obtained by fitting the Nyquist plots in this region.34,35Fig. 4b shows the Rrec values of the perovskite solar cells with ZnO and ZnO/PCBM at different applied voltages under 1-sun illumination. As shown in Fig. 4b, the device with ZnO/PCBM exhibited higher Rrec values (lower recombination rate) compared to those of the device containing only ZnO at low applied bias, indicating that surface charge recombination was significantly suppressed by the interfacial modification.36 Interestingly, the interfacial modification of ZnO also decreased the extent of bulk charge recombination, which corresponds to the higher Rrec values obtained at high applied bias.37 We speculate that the reduced bulk charge recombination is attributed to an increased built-in potential, due to the modified electronic structure of the ZnO/PCBM substrate, which facilitated more efficient sweeping of photo-generated charge carriers.17 Therefore, based on the light-intensity dependence of Voc and the IS measurements, it is confirmed that the interfacial modification of the ZnO substrate with PCBM significantly reduced the trap-assisted charge recombination at the interfaces as well as in the absorber of the devices, thereby enhancing the device performance.
To further optimize the perovskite solar cells, we incorporated 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) as the HTL which is the most widely used organic transport layer in SDSSCs and perovskite solar cells due to its excellent optical transparency in the visible range.38,39Fig. 5 shows the current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the devices with a structure of ITO/ZnO/PCBM/CH3NH3PbI3/spiro-OMeTAD/MoO3/Ag, under AM 1.5 G irradiation with an irradiation intensity of 100 mW cm−2 and the corresponding external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectrum (inset). As shown in Fig. 5, the PHJ perovskite solar cell showed a very high PCE of 12.2% with a Jsc of 18.18 mA cm−2, a Voc of 1.00 V, and a FF of 67%. The outperforming efficiency of the spiro-OMeTAD device compared to the efficiency of the PTB7-Th device is attributed to the higher Jsc, which is mainly derived from efficient light harvesting with EQE values approaching 80% over the wavelength range of 400–650 nm, as shown in the inset of Fig. 5. It is noteworthy that the results obtained for our optimized device are among the best reported for state-of-the-art low-temperature solution-processed photovoltaic devices.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we successfully demonstrated efficient PHJ perovskite solar cells with a high PCE of 12.2% by fine-tuning the interfacial properties of a sol–gel-processed ZnO ECL using PCBM as an organic surface modifier. By depositing PCBM onto the ZnO film, the Voc values of the devices with ZnO/PCBM substrates increased to ∼1.03 V compared to the Voc of ∼0.83 V measured for devices with only ZnO due to the modified electronic structure of the ZnO layer, as evidenced by the results of photoelectron spectroscopy analysis. In addition, trap-assisted charge recombination at the interface of ZnO and in the bulk of the perovskite absorber was effectively suppressed by the interfacial modification, thereby improving the performance of the devices. These results highlight the importance of interfacial engineering as a new strategy for improving the PCEs of planar-structured perovskite solar cells. By further optimization and by pursuing a rational interfacial engineering design, we expect that greater performance enhancements can be achieved in the near future.

 	Fig. 1  (a) The device structure of the planar-heterojunction perovskite solar cells and the molecular structures of the interfacial layers PCBM. A cross-sectional SEM image of the device is also shown. Energy-level diagram of the components of the perovskite solar cells (b) without and (c) with PCBM. The energy-level offset (ΔEoff) is the energy-level difference between the quasi Fermi levels of the electron collection layer and the hole transport layer.	 

 	Fig. 2  (a) UPS spectra of ITO, ITO/ZnO, ITO/ZnO/PCBM, and ITO/ZnO/perovskite films, (left) the valence band edge, (middle) whole UPS photoemission spectra, and (right) the magnified section of the photoemission onset. (b) Energy-level diagrams of the various films resulting from the UPS studies. The Fermi level (EF) values of each film are aligned due to the thermodynamic equilibrium that arises when they are joined together.	 

 	Fig. 3  (a) Current density–voltage characteristics of the planar-heterojunction perovskite solar cells incorporating ITO/ZnO and ITO/ZnO/PCBM as cathodes measured under AM 1.5 G irradiation at 100 mW cm−2. (b) EQE spectra of the perovskite solar cells.	 


ITO/ZnO	0.78 ± 0.05	14.54 ± 0.16	0.68 ± 0.01	7.65 ± 0.47 (8.37)	9.0 ± 0.87
ITO/ZnO/PCBM	1.02 ± 0.01	14.73 ± 0.23	0.73 ± 0.02	10.87 ± 0.13 (11.04)	7.4 ± 0.25

 	Fig. 4  (a) Light-intensity dependence of the Voc of the perovskite solar cells with ZnO and ZnO/PCBM. The lines represent the best fits to the data, for which the slope is indicated. (b) Recombination resistance at different applied biases extracted from IS characterization of the perovskite solar cells.	 

 	Fig. 5  (a) Current density–voltage characteristics of the best planar-heterojunction perovskite solar cells with a structure of ITO/ZnO/PCBM/CH3NH3PbI3/spiro-OMeTAD/MoOx/Ag measured under AM 1.5 G irradiation at 100 mW cm−2. EQE spectrum of the device is shown in the inset.
