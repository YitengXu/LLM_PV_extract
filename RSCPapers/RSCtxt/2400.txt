    , Accepted 17th June 2015First published on 7th July 2015AbstractPerovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted considerable attention because of their low fabrication cost and impressive energy conversion efficiency. The perovskite layer of planar PSCs is usually prepared by coating a solution of perovskite precursors, that is, PbI2, PbCl2 and methylammonium iodide (MAI), on poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS, Clevios P VP Al 4083). Here, the deposition of the perovskite layer from its precursor solution saliently affects the electronic structure and properties of PEDOT:PSS films and thus the photovoltaic performance of planar PSCs. The conductivity of PEDOT:PSS is significantly enhanced from 10−3 to 101 S cm−1. The conductivity enhancement is not due to the solvent but mainly MAI. Even more significant conductivity enhancement occurs for PEDOT:PSS films after being coated with a dimethylformamide (DMF) solution of MAI, while pure DMF only slightly increases the conductivity of PEDOT:PSS by a factor of 2–3. PEDOT:PSS films become rougher after the deposition of a perovskite or MAI layer. The conductivity enhancements are attributed to the phase segregation of PSSH chains from PEDOT:PSS and the conformational change of PEDOT chains. The treatment of PEDOT:PSS with the organic solutions of MAI and solvents of perovskite precursor solutions also affects the photovoltaic performance of the planar PSCs.
1. Introduction
Organic–inorganic lead halide based perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have emerged as a promising solar cell technology because of their low fabrication cost and very impressive energy conversion efficiency.1–11 An energy conversion efficiency of higher than 20% has been demonstrated. The high energy conversion efficiency is related to the appropriate bandgap, excellent light absorption, efficient free charge carrier generation and long carrier diffusion length of organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite materials.12,13 The perovskite layer also has the advantage of low fabrication cost, because it can be fabricated by solution processing.14,15 The photovoltaic performance of PSCs strongly depends on the morphology of the perovskite layer, and the morphology of the perovskite layer is sensitive to experimental conditions. There are mainly two types of PSCs in terms of the device structure. One type of PSC has a scaffold oxide layer on the transparent electrode.16–21 The perovskite layer is deposited on the scaffold oxide layer. The electrons generated in the perovskite layer are collected through the scaffold oxide layer by the transparent electrode. The other type of PSC has a planar structure with a poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS, chemical structure shown in Fig. 1) layer coated on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) or indium tin oxide (ITO).22–29 PEDOT:PSS serves as a buffer layer for hole collection. The perovskite layer is usually deposited on PEDOT:PSS by coating an organic solution of perovskite precursors. Popular precursors are PbI2, PbCl2, and methylammonium iodide (MAI). Polar organic solvents, such as dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), dimethylformamide (DMF) or γ-butyrolactone (GBL), or their cosolvents are used as the solvents of the precursors. The temperature of the precursor solution during coating can saliently affect the morphology of the perovskite layer and thus the photovoltaic performance of PSCs.30 The as-prepared perovskite thin films are then subjected to a thermal annealing process at temperatures ranging from 100 to 150 °C.31,32 The coating of the perovskite layer may have an effect on the structure and properties of the PEDOT:PSS layer and thus the photovoltaic performance of planar PSCs.

In this work, we found that the solution deposition of perovskite materials, including CH3NH3PbI3 and CH3NH3PbI3−xClx, can significantly enhance the conductivity of PEDOT:PSS from 10−3 S cm−1 to 101 S cm−1 and roughen the surface of PEDOT:PSS. The precursor, MAI, is the main factor for the conductivity enhancement.
2. Experimental
2.1. Materials and treatment of PEDOT:PSS films
PEDOT:PSS aqueous solution (Clevios P VP Al 4083) was purchased from Heraeus. The concentration of PEDOT:PSS was 1.3–1.7% by weight, and the weight ratio of PSS to PEDOT was 6. MAI was obtained from Dysol. Other chemicals, including PbI2, PbCl2, DMSO, DMF and GBL, were supplied by Sigma-Aldrich. All materials were used as received.
PEDOT:PSS films were prepared by spin coating their aqueous solution on pre-cleaned glass substrates of 1.3 × 1.3 cm2. They were subsequently dried at 120 °C on a hot plate for 20 min. The treatment was performed by adding dropwise 100 μl of a solvent or solution onto each PEDOT:PSS film at 120 °C. After the PEDOT:PSS films were dried, they were then rinsed with deionized (DI) water and dried again at 120 °C. The PbI2-treated films were rinsed with DMF.
2.2. Characterization of materials
The conductivities of the PEDOT:PSS films were measured by the four-probe technique with a Keithley 2400 source/meter. The electrical contacts were made by pressing indium on the four corners of each PEDOT:PSS film on the glass substrate. UV absorption spectra were obtained with a Varian Cary 5000 UV-vis-NIR spectrometer. X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) and ultraviolet photoelectron spectra (UPS) were collected with an Axis Ultra DLD X-ray photoelectron spectrometer equipped with an Al Kα X-ray source (1486.6 eV). He I (21.2 eV) was used as the light source for UPS. The atomic force microscopic (AFM) images were acquired with a Veeco NanoScope IV Multi-Mode AFM in tapping mode. The thicknesses of the PEDOT:PSS films were measured using an Alpha-Step IQ surface profiler.
2.3. Fabrication and characterization of PSCs
ITO glass substrates were cleaned sequentially in detergent, deionized (DI) water, acetone, and isopropanol by sonication for 20 min. After drying under N2 stream, the substrates were further treated with UV-ozone for 15 min. A PEDOT:PSS layer with a thickness of ∼40 nm was prepared by spin coating Clevios P VP Al 4083 on ITO substrates at 2000 rpm for 1 min and subsequently annealed at 120 °C for 15 min in air. The substrates coated with PEDOT:PSS were then transferred into a glovebox filled with highly pure N2. The moisture and oxygen levels in the glovebox were less than 1 ppm. The perovskite layer was deposited by spin coating a solution consisting of 1.246 M PbI2, 0.154 M PbCl2 and 1.3 M MAI in cosolvents of DMSO:GBL (volume ratio = 3:7) at 1000 rpm for 20 s, and then at 3500 rpm for 60 s. After 50 s from the start of the spin coating, 1000 μl anhydrous toluene was added dropwise onto each spinning film. Then, the as-cast films were annealed at 100 °C for 20 min. The thickness of the perovskite thin films was around 300 nm. The phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) layer with a thickness of about 55 nm was deposited by spin coating a chlorobenzene solution of 20 mg ml−1 PCBM at 2000 rpm for 40 s. A sub-nanometer thick rhodamine 101 layer was subsequently spin coated from its 0.05 wt% isopropanol solution. The devices were completed by thermally depositing 30 nm-thick C60, 0.5 nm-thick rhodamine 101, 0.5 nm-thick LiF and finally 100 nm-thick Ag in a vacuum of <1 × 10−6 mbar. Each device had an area of 0.11 cm2. The PSCs were encapsulated with UV-curable epoxy and cover glass slides in the glovebox. The photovoltaic performance of the PSCs was tested in air with a computer-programmed Keithley 2400 source/meter and a Newport's Oriel class A solar simulator, which simulated the AM1.5 sunlight with an energy density of 100 mW cm−2 and was certified to the JIS C 8912 standard.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Conductivity enhancements of PEDOT:PSS films after the deposition of perovskite materials and perovskite precursors
PEDOT:PSS films were formed by spin coating PEDOT:PSS aqueous solution (Clevios PVP 4083) on glass or quartz substrates. The perovskite layer was deposited on PEDOT:PSS by adding dropwise a DMSO solution of 0.1 M MAI and 0.1 M PbI2 at 120 °C. The solvent was vaporized, and the precursors were converted into the organic inorganic hybrid perovskite material, CH3NH3PbI3. The perovskite layer was then rinsed away with DMF. It was dried by annealing at 120 °C for 5 min. The conductivity was measured on the dried PEDOT:PSS films. The conductivity of the as-prepared PEDOT:PSS films from the aqueous solution was 1.7 × 10−3 S cm−1. It increased to 40 S cm−1 after the deposition and rinsing away of the CH3NH3PbI3 layer. When PbCl2 was used to replace PbI2 in the precursor solution, the conductivity of the final PEDOT:PSS films is almost the same as that with the solution of PbI2 and MAI. Apart from DMSO, DMF was also used as the solvent for the deposition of the perovskite materials on PEDOT:PSS. The conductivities of PEDOT:PSS films increased to 20 S cm−1 when a DMF solution of 0.1 M MAI and 0.1 M PbI2 was used. The conductivity of PEDOT:PSS was 15 S cm−1 when a DMF solution of 0.1 M MAI and 0.1 M PbCl2 was used.
The conductivity enhancement of PEDOT:PSS may not be attributed to the solvent, although some polar organic solvents like DMSO can enhance the conductivity of PEDOT:PSS.33–38 An organic solvent was added dropwise on PEDOT:PSS films at 120 °C until the vaporization of the organic solvent. The conductivity of the dried PEDOT:PSS films was measured after such a treatment. Table 1 presents the conductivity of PEDOT:PSS after being treated with DMF or DMSO. DMF only slightly increases the conductivity of PEDOT:PSS to 5 × 10−3 S cm−1, significantly lower than that by the perovskite solutions. This is also the reason that DMF is used to rinse away the perovskite materials from the surface of PEDOT:PSS films, because the effect of DMF on the conductivity of PEDOT:PSS is negligible. However, the conductivity of PEDOT:PSS can be enhanced to 10 S cm−1 after a treatment with DMSO. This conductivity is saliently lower than that with the DMSO solutions of the precursors.

Fig. 1(a) shows the conductivities of PEDOT:PSS films after being treated with DMSO or DMF at different temperatures. The conductivity is not sensitive to the temperature during the treatment. GBL is also often used as the solvent for the deposition of the perovskite materials. The conductivity of PEDOT:PSS only slightly increases after a treatment with GBL. As shown in Table 1, the solvent effects on the conductivity of PEDOT:PSS can be attributed to their polarity. The dielectric constant of DMSO is 49, higher than that of DMF (ε = 37) and GBL (ε = 39).
DMF/GBL and DMSO/GBL cosolvents are also often used as the solvent of perovskite precursor solution. Treating PEDOT:PSS films with a cosolvent of DMSO/GBL (volume ratio = 3:7) or DMF/GBL (volume ratio = 3:7) only slightly increases the conductivity of the PEDOT:PSS films, similar to that with neat DMF or GBL (Table 1).
In order to understand the main factor for the conductivity enhancement, organic solutions of individual precursor were used to treat PEDOT:PSS. Table 2 lists the conductivities of the PEDOT:PSS films treated with various solutions at 120 °C. The presence of a small amount of MAI in a solvent can significantly enhance the conductivity of PEDOT:PSS films. The conductivity of PEDOT:PSS films treated with a DMF solution of 0.1 M MAI increases up to higher than 50 S cm−1. The conductivity exhibits a weak dependence on the treating temperature from 90 to 150 °C (Fig. 1(a)). The presence of a small amount MAI in DMSO can give rise to even more significant conductivity enhancement. The conductivities of the PEDOT:PSS films are 37 and 55 S cm−1 after being treated with 0.01 M and 0.1 M MAI in DMSO, respectively. However, a treatment of PEDOT:PSS films with a GBL solution of 0.1 M MAI at 120 °C increases the conductivity of PEDOT:PSS films only to 0.01 S cm−1.

A detailed study was carried out on the conductivity enhancement of PEDOT:PSS films by a DMF solution of MAI, because DMF that has a low boiling point compared to DMSO and GBL is easily removed and the conductivity enhancements of DMF and DMF solutions of MAI are much more different than that with DMSO or GBL. Fig. 1(b) presents the variation of the conductivity of the treated PEDOT:PSS films with the MAI concentration in DMF. The conductivity dramatically increases in the MAI concentration range from 10−4 to 10−3 M. It then becomes almost flat when the concentration is higher than 10−3 M. The conductivity of pristine PEDOT:PSS films is 1.7 × 10−3 S cm−1. It increases to 20 and 60 S cm−1 after a treatment with 0.001 and 0.05 M MAI/DMF solution, respectively.
Organic solutions of PbI2 or PbCl2 were also used to treat PEDOT:PSS films. A treatment with a DMSO solution of 0.1 M PbI2 or PbCl2 can enhance the conductivity of PEDOT:PSS to 20 S cm−1, less significant than that with a DMSO solution of 0.1 M MAI. The conductivity of PEDOT:PSS films is 0.5 or 10 S cm−1 after being treated with a DMF solution of 0.1 M PbCl2 or 0.1 M PbI2. The conductivity enhancement is less significant than that with a DMF solution of MAI.
DMF/GBL and DMSO/GBL cosolvents were used as the solvent of perovskite precursor solutions.32,39 PEDOT:PSS were treated with a MAI solution in a cosolvent of DMSO/GBL (volume ratio = 3:7) or DMF/GBL (volume ratio = 3:7). The conductivity enhancement is similar to the treatment with MAI in a neat solvent of DMSO or DMF. As presented above, DMF, DMF/GBL and DMSO/GBL only slightly affect the conductivity of PEDOT:PSS films. The conductivity enhancement is thus primarily due to MAI. Thus, we can understand the effect of the solution deposition of the perovskite materials on PEDOT:PSS by investigating the effect of the solution deposition of MAI, because it is much easier to completely remove MAI than perovskite materials from PEDOT:PSS.
Apart from the conductivity, the work function is also an important parameter for PEDOT:PSS as a buffer layer in planar PSCs. The effects of the treatments with solvents and a perovskite precursor solution on the work function of the PEDOT:PSS film were studied by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) (Fig. 2). The work functions of the PEDOT:PSS films treated with a DMF solution of 0.1 M MAI and DMSO are around 5.0 eV, which is slightly lower than that (5.2 eV) of the pristine PEDOT:PSS film. The effect of a treatment with DMF on the work function is less remarkable than that with a DMF solution of MAI or DMSO.

3.2. Mechanism for the conductivity enhancements
These results indicate that MAI is the main factor for the conductivity enhancement of PEDOT:PSS. In order to understand the mechanism for the conductivity enhancement, the structure and properties of PEDOT:PSS films before and after a treatment were characterized. Fig. 3(a) presents the UV absorption spectra of pristine PEDOT:PSS films and PEDOT:PSS films treated with DMF, DMSO and DMF solutions of 0.1 M MAI. The two absorption bands at the wavelength below 250 nm originate from the aromatic ring of PSS.35–37,40 Their intensity drops after the treatment. This suggests the phase segregation of PSSH from PEDOT:PSS. Some PSS chains are rinsed away by DI water from the PEDOT:PSS films treated with a DMSO or DMF solution of MAI. The decrease in the PSS absorption after the different treatments is consistent with the conductivity enhancement by these treatments.
 Fig. 3  (a) UV absorption spectra of a pristine PEDOT:PSS film and PEDOT:PSS films treated with a DMF solution of 0.1 M MAI, DMF, and DMSO. (b) S 2p XPS spectra of a pristine PEDOT:PSS film and PEDOT:PSS films treated with a DMF solution of 0.1 M MAI, DMF, and DMSO. 
The removal of PSS from PEDOT:PSS films during the treatment with a DMSO or DMF solution of MAI is confirmed by using X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) of the PEDOT:PSS films (Fig. 3(b)). The two XPS bands with binding energies between 166 and 172 eV are the S 2p band of the sulfur atoms in PSS, whereas the other two XPS bands with binding energies between 162 and 166 eV are the S 2p band of the sulfur atoms in PEDOT.40–42 The S 2p XPS intensity ratio of PEDOT to PSS hardly changed after the DMF treatment, while it significantly increases after the treatment with a DMF solution of MAI or DMSO. Thus, the change in the UV absorption spectra of PEDOT:PSS films after being treated with DMF can be attributed to the phase segregation. As reported before, a PEDOT:PSS film with two phases of PSSH and PEDOT:PSS has lower absorption than a PEDOT:PSS film with only one phase of PEDOT:PSS.40
In terms of the UV absorption and UPS spectra, the mechanism for the conductivity enhancements of PEDOT:PSS by organic solutions of MAI can be attributed to the MAI-induced phase segregation of PSSH chains from PEDOT:PSS. The softness parameters of CH3NH3+ and I− are 10.7 and 0.5, respectively.43 The softness parameter of a species is related to its association with other species. An anion with a positive (negative) softness parameter can have strong association with a cation with a positive (negative) softness parameter. It has been reported that a cation with a positive softness parameter can strongly associate with PSS− and an anion with positive softness parameter can have strong association with the positively charge PEDOT chains.36,37 Thus, CH3NH3+ can associate with PSS−, while I− can associate with PEDOT+. As a result, the Coulombic attraction between PEDOT+ and PSS− is screened by CH3N3+ and I−. This can lead to a phase segregation of PSSH chains from PEDOT:PSS, because PEDOT is hydrophobic while PSS or PSSH is hydrophilic. The PSSH chains segregated from PEDOT:PSS can be rinsed away by water. The low conductivity of pristine PEDOT:PSS from its aqueous solution is due to the presence of excess PSSH chains. The removal of some PSSH chains can thus facilitate the charge transport and give rise to high conductivity. Moreover, the removal of some excess PSSH chains from PEDOT:PSS can induce the conformational change of PEDOT chains from a coil structure to an extended coil or linear structure.40 The extended coil or linear structure can facilitate the charge transport across the PEDOT chains.
The removal of PSSH chains and the conformational change of the PEDOT chains can affect the morphology of the PEDOT:PSS films. The morphology of the PEDOT:PSS films was studied by atomic force microscopy (AFM) before and after the treatments. As shown in Fig. 4, the pristine PEDOT:PSS film is quite smooth with a RMS roughness of 0.975 nm. The surface became rougher after a treatment with a DMF solution of MAI or DMSO, and grains can be observed on the polymer surface. The grain sizes are about 50 and 40 nm for the PEDOT:PSS films treated with a DMF solution of 0.1 M MAI and DMSO, respectively. Correspondingly, the RMS roughness increases to 1.993 and 4.37 nm for the PEDOT:PSS films after these treatments. In contrast, the grain size of the PEDOT:PSS films treated with DMF is only about 20 nm. The AFM images agree well with the conductivity enhancements, the UV absorption spectra and the XPS spectra.

3.3. Effect of the treatments on the photovoltaic performance of PSCs
The precursors and the solvents of organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite materials can affect the conductivity and morphology of PEDOT:PSS films. Their effects on the photovoltaic performance of planar PSCs with a PEDOT:PSS layer on ITO were investigated as well. Scheme 1 presents the architecture of PSCs. A perovskite layer was deposited on PEDOT:PSS by coating a solution of PbI2, PbCl2 and MAI. The morphology of the perovskite layer on pristine and treated PEDOT:PSS films is shown in Fig. 5. The perovskite crystalline grains appear in all of the perovskite films. The surface morphology and roughness of perovskite layers are almost the same on the pristine and treated PEDOT:PSS films in terms of the AFM images.

The current density (J)–voltage (V) curves of PSCs under AM 1.5G illumination are shown in Fig. 6. The photovoltaic performances are summarized in Table 3. The PEDOT:PSS layer is thicker than that in optimal PSCs with an untreated PEDOT:PSS buffer layer because a treatment can lower the thickness of the PEDOT:PSS films as a result of some PSSH removal. The same experimental conditions were used to deposit the perovskite layer on the PEDOT:PSS layer for all PSCs. The PSC with pristine PEDOT:PSS exhibits a Jsc of 16.91 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.07 V, a FF of 0.77 and an overall power conversation efficiency (PCE) of 14.0%. The Jsc values of the PSCs with PEDOT:PSS treated with a DMF, DMSO, and DMF solution of 0.1 M MAI are 17.44, 19.41 and 18.14 mA cm−2, respectively. Such an enhancement in Jsc values is confirmed by the incidence photon to current efficiency (IPCE) measurement (Fig. 6(b)). The increase in Jsc can be attributed to the high conductivity and rough surface of the PEDOT:PSS films after the treatments. The Voc values of the PSCs with PEDOT:PSS films treated with a DMSO or DMF solution of MAI are slightly lower than that of the control PSC with pristine PEDOT:PSS. This is due to the slight decrease in the work function of the PEDOT:PSS films after a treatment as revealed by the UPS results. The FF values of the PSCs with treated PEDOT:PSS films are remarkably lower than the control PSC with pristine PEDOT:PSS. As a result, the PCEs of the PSCs with treated PEDOT:PSS films are slightly lower than the PCE of the control PSC with pristine PEDOT:PSS.

In order to further understand the treatment effect on photovoltaic performance, the series resistance (Rs) and shunt resistance (Rsh) were extracted in terms of the slopes of the J–V curves at 1.8 V and 0 V, respectively, in the dark (Table 3). The control PSC using untreated PEDOT:PSS exhibits a Rs value of 3.0 Ω cm2 and a Rsh value of 1538 kΩ cm2. A treatment of the PEDOT:PSS buffer layer slightly decreases Rs while significantly decreases Rsh of PSCs. The decrease in Rs can be attributed to the conductivity enhancement after the treatments. The drop in Rsh can be mainly ascribed to surface roughening of the PEDOT:PSS buffer layer by the treatments. A rough surface can lead to higher leakage current. In addition, the removal of some PSSH chains can make the surface of the PEDOT:PSS films more hydrophobic. This can lower the wettability of the perovskite layer on PEDOT:PSS and induce some defects on the perovskite layer. This can increase the leakage current as well.
Hysteresis behaviour is often observed in perovskite solar cells. The reasons for hysteresis in J–V measurements are still under debate. It might be related to ferroelectric domains in the perovskite layer,44–47 trapping/detrapping of charge carriers due to defects48,49 or ion migration.48,50 We measured the J–V curves along the forward and reverse directions (Fig. 7). The PSCs with pristine or DMF-treated PEDOT:PSS showed little hysteresis, while that of DMSO-treated or MAI solution-treated PEDOT:PSS showed prominent hysteresis behaviour. Presumably, the hysteresis is related to the roughness of the PEDOT:PSS layer. A rougher surface may give rise to more remarkable hysteresis.

4. Conclusions
The perovskite layer of planar PSCs is usually deposited by coating an organic solution of perovskite precursors on PEDOT:PSS that is a buffer layer on ITO or FTO. The solution deposition of perovskite materials can significantly enhance the conductivity of PEDOT:PSS from 10−3 to 101 S cm−1. The solvents of perovskite precursor solutions and organic solutions of individual precursor were investigated to understand the main factor for the conductivity enhancement. MAI is identified as the main factor for the conductivity enhancement of PEDOT:PSS. As revealed by UV absorption spectroscopy, XPS spectroscopy and AFM, the conductivity enhancement is attributed to the MAI-induced phase segregation of PSSH chains from PEDOT:PSS and the conformational change of the conductive PEDOT chains. The treatment of the PEDOT:PSS buffer layer also has impact on the photovoltaic performance of planar PSCs. It increases Jsc while lowers FF of PSCs.
