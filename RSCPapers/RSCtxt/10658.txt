    , Accepted 2nd August 2021First published on 3rd August 2021AbstractHydrogen generation during wastewater treatment has remained a long-standing challenge for the environment preservation welfare. In the present work, we have fabricated a promising bifunctional thin film-based catalyst for hydrogen generation with concurrent wastewater treatment. The prepared catalyst film is a vertically oriented thin SnS (tin monosulfide) nanosheet array on a Ni-foam (SnS/NF) obtained via a solution process, demonstrating a promising electrocatalytic activity towards the generation of green H2 fuel at the cathodic side and the decomposition of urea waste at the anodic side. Notably, while assembling two identical electrodes as cathode and anode together with a reference electrode (i.e., SnS/NF∥SnS/NF vs. RHE assembly) in 1 M KOH aqueous electrolyte containing 0.33 M urea, the electrolyzer electrolyzed urea at a lower cell potential of 1.37 and 1.43 V (vs. RHE) to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm−2 and 50 mA cm−2, respectively, for the decomposition of urea at the anodic SnS/NF electrode and green hydrogen fuel generation at the cathodic SnS/NF electrode. This activity on electrocatalytic urea decomposition lies within the best performance to those of the previously reported sulfide-based and other catalytic materials. The promising catalytic activities of the SnS catalyst film are attributed to its combined effect of self-standing nanosheet array morphology and high crystallinity, which provides abundant active sites and a facile charge transfer path between the nanosheet arrays and the electrolyte. Thus, the present work offers a green avenue to the waste-urea treatment in water and sustainable hydrogen energy production.
Introduction
A recent survey of the World Health Organization indicates that clean drinking water and waste management are the most urgent global challenge of this decade.1 On the other hand, with an ever-increasing population, global energy demand is rocketing day by day. The majority of the current energy demand has been fulfilled from non-renewable fossil resources, such as coal, oil, and gas.2,3 However, these resources are impacting major concerns on climate change due to greenhouse gas emissions, while on the other hand, the unsustainability of these resources is inevitably causing an energy crisis in the near future.4–7 Hence, an alternative sustainable and emission-free green energy, which could play a significant role in fulfilling the present and future global energy demands without hampering the global ecosystem, is peremptory.8–10 Currently, a hydrogen generation technology via electrochemical water splitting is considered an attractive zero-emission path to obtain green hydrogen fuel.11 Basically, electrochemical water splitting (consisting of hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions (HER and OER) requires a high cell voltage,12–17 and presently, noble metal-based electrocatalysts, such as RuO2, IrO2, and Pt exhibiting high performance for OER and HER with lower overpotentials have been employed as the state-of-the-art catalytic electrodes.18,19 However, the high cost and scarcity of these noble metal-based electrocatalysts hinder their widespread commercial application. Consequently, the search for low-cost and promising electrocatalysts based on earth-abundant resources is highly desirable.
More importantly, the combination of wastewater treatment and generation of H2 simultaneously as a green fuel through an electrochemical water-splitting route could be an attractive asset in sustainable development. Due to rapid industrialization and development, water scarcity and toxic-waste contamination in water also has become a great challenge for the sustainable development of a healthy society. In the index of water contamination, urea is one of the wastes potentially dangerous for groundwater,20–24 and this should be managed properly. Therefore, urea-rich-water decontamination has become a crucial environmental and health concern. The existing methods for urea-containing wastewater management, viz. pyrolysis hydrolysis, enzymatic decomposition, biological decomposition, chemical oxidation, and chemi- or physi-sorption are not eco- and economic friendly as they require high pressure, heat, and use of strong oxidants.20 In contrast, the electrolysis of urea offers a dual benefit, that is, the production of hydrogen at the cathode and decomposition of urea at the anode, thereby decontaminating toxic urea-rich wastewater. The electrochemical oxidation of urea (UOR) occurs via the following anodic reaction: CO(NH2)2 + 6OH− → N2 + CO2 + 5H2O + 6e− at the expense of significantly lower thermodynamic potential than that required for water oxidation (i.e., 1.23 V vs. RHE) while the HER reaction proceeds at the following cathodic reaction: 6H2O + 6e− → 3H2 + 6OH−, with a thermodynamic cell voltage of 1.23 V for overall-water electrolysis.25–32 Thus, the electrochemical oxidation of urea is thermodynamically feasible than water oxidation. Moreover, the electrolysis can be operated employing green electricity obtained from solar, wind, and water-based renewable energy conversion technology. Therefore, the UOR process can be an ultimate alternative option towards sustainable H2 production and urea detoxification. Similar to water splitting, expensive RuO2, IrO2, and Pt have been proclaimed as high performance UOR and HER electrocatalysts. However, the limited availability of these expensive and rare metal based materials along with their frequent poisoning on the active sites of the catalyst limits their wide commercial applications. As a result, an earth-abundant material-based cost-effective, and robust catalyst can overcome this challenge and can be an alternative and promising substitute for the state-of-the-art expensive noble metal-based electrocatalysts.
Recently various earth abundant materials, such as transition metal chalcogenides (TMC),33–38 metal oxides,39 fluorides,40 nitrites,41 metal organic frameworks (MOFs)42–44 and phosphides,45 have been demonstrated as catalysts for water splitting. Among them, Sn-based chalcogenides are non-toxic and earth abundant, which makes them promising candidates for catalysis.46,47 Especially, orthorhombic herzenbergite tin monosulfide (SnS) has suitable physical and chemical properties. It has a two dimensional (2D) layered crystal structure. Having a two-dimensional (2D) layered structure and ultrathin thickness, SnS consists of highly abundant active sites with an easily accessible gateway for electrolytes. Moreover, metals in high oxidation states are known to have strong catalytic properties and oxidizing power. Sn metal having a high oxidation number up to +4 can undergo multi-electron transfer during OER and UOR. On the other hand, the electronegative S atoms in SnS experiences repulsion between S 3p orbital and O 2p orbital of S and of –OH, which could accelerate the oxidation of –OOH intermediates, thereby accelerating the OER and UOR.33,47–51
Hence, self-standing thin film of SnS nanosheet arrays on nickel foam (NF) was synthesized via a simple ethanolic solution based solvothermal process at 80 °C, which demonstrated an impressive bifunctional feature on electrochemical urea oxidation at the anode, thereby decontaminating the toxic urea-waste and a simultaneous generation of green H2 fuel at the cathode. Specifically, upon devising an SnS/NF∥SnS/NF vs. RHE based electrolyzer, the cell-potentials of 1.37 and 1.43 V (vs. RHE) were achieved to deliver the current density of 10 and 50 mA cm−2, respectively for overall urea electrolysis (i.e., HER∥UOR) in an aqueous electrolyte of 1 M KOH containing 0.33 M urea.
Experimental
Reagents and chemicals
Tin(II) chloride (SnCl2), thioacetamide (C2H5NS), and ethyl alcohol (C2H5OH) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. Nickel foam (NF, cell size: 450 μm, thickness: 1.6 mm) was obtained from ALANTUM, S. Korea, and all other chemicals were used as received without additional purification.
Synthesis of SnS thin film
SnS film was fabricated using the previously reported method with a little modification.52,53 Briefly, 25 mL ethanolic solution of 0.1 M tin dichloride (SnCl2) and an equal volume of ethanolic solution of 0.1 M thioacetamide (C2H5NS) was mixed in a 50 ml capacity Falcon tube. A clean NF-substrate was placed vertically in the Falcon tube, and the tube was closed, followed by heating the reaction mixture in a water bath at 80 °C for 3 h to 4 h. After completion of the reaction, the bath was allowed to cool to room temperature, and the SnS film deposited on the substrate was washed thoroughly with ethanol. Finally, the obtained film was dried at room temperature and used for further characterization.
Film characterization
The surface topography of the deposited films was analyzed with field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, HITACHI S4800) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL-3000F). Crystal structure, chemical composition, and binding states of SnS in the film were examined using an X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku D/MAX 2600V, Cu Kα = 0.15418 nm) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, K-alpha plus, Thermo Scientific, USA).
Electrochemical characterization
Electrochemical performance of the SnS/NF electrode towards OER, UOR, and HER was investigated via VERSA-STAT3 (Princeton Applied Research) electrochemical workstation in a three-electrode-based single-compartment system. A graphite rod and a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) were used as the counter and reference electrode, respectively. OER performance was evaluated via the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) technique in a potential range from 1.0 to 1.8 V vs. RHE with a scan rate of 5 mV s−1 in 1 M aqueous KOH electrolyte. Similarly, urea oxidation (UOR) was assessed in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte containing 0.33 M urea. HER measurements were recorded in a potential range of 0.1 to −0.4 V vs. RHE at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1. The stability of the SnS/NF electrode was examined via chronopotentiometry measurement at room temperature. All potentials were calibrated to the potential on the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) scale using eqn (1) given below, (1)where  at 25 °C.
Before recording the linear sweep voltammograms, the catalyst electrode was activated by continuous cycling in CV mode at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1. Particularly, the cycling was performed towards the cathodic direction in the potential range of −1.15 V to −1.5 V (vs. RHE) until stable voltammograms were obtained. All the recorded voltammograms (LSV) were corrected for iR losses. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was recorded with an AC amplitude of 10 mV in the frequency range of 0.1 mHz to 10 kHz. The electrochemical active surface areas (ECSA) of the electrodes were estimated by measuring double-layer capacitance (Cdl) via CV at various scan rates. The Cdl values were calculated from the slope of the straight line obtained by plotting (Ja–Jc) vs. scan rate, where Ja and Jc represent the anodic and cathodic current densities, respectively.
Results and discussion
SnS film morphology

Fig. 1a shows the SEM image of the as-synthesized SnS film. As can be seen from the image, the SnS film possesses vertically oriented thin nanosheet arrays having an average sheet thickness of about 16 to 20 nm. The nanosheet arrays are distributed homogeneously, covering the whole surface of the substrate. Notably, only two-dimensional (2-D) nanosheet array morphology was observed in this film, implying an almost 2-D morphological yield, which could be an exciting feature of SnS for various applications, including catalysis owing to their high open surface area accessible for electrolytes.
 Fig. 1  (a) SEM, (b) TEM, (c) HR-TEM, and (d) SAED patterns of the same SnS film. 
Following the SEM, TEM images also reveal that the as-synthesized SnS film has nanosheet morphologies, as shown in Fig. 1b. Furthermore, the HR-TEM image of the SnS nanosheets (Fig. 1c) indicates well-ordered lattice fringes. Fig. S1(a and b†) shows the FFT and iFFT patterns of SnS nanosheets obtained by processing the HR-TEM image via ImageJ computer program. The resulting phase profile (Fig. S1c†) showing 0.17 nm spacing of crystal lattice was obtained, which based on JCPDS: 00-039-0354 record can be indexed to (151) planes of the SnS film. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern is shown in Fig. 1d, which indicates a polycrystalline phase of the SnS nanosheets.
Crystal structure and chemical composition of the deposited film
A thin film X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern was evaluated in the range of 2 theta from 20°–60° to confirm the phase of the as-synthesized SnS nanosheet arrays. Fig. 2a shows the XRD pattern of the as-deposited SnS film on a nickel foam (NF) substrate. The diffraction peaks appeared from the (110), (120), (021), (101), (111), (131) (210), (211), and (151) planes indicate the orthorhombic phase of the SnS, which are in a good agreement with the reference JCPDS 00-039-0354 file in literature.54–56 The XRD peak corresponding to the (151) plane is also consistent with the HR-TEM result (Fig. 1c). The inset of Fig. 2a represents the schematic ball and stick model structure of the orthorhombic (also known as herzenbergite) SnS phase, which consists of a layered nanosheet structure. In this model structure, the yellow color displays “S” and the light purple color indicates “Sn”. Based on this crystal phase structure, the obtained simulated XRD patterns have been added in Fig. 2a, which shows that the experimentally obtained XRD patterns and the simulated ones are matching well with each other. In line with the XRD results, the SAED patterns of Fig. 1d also indicate the polycrystalline nature of SnS nanosheets with the pattern rings resembling the orthorhombic SnS phase. The energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analysis data (Fig. S2†) further confirmed a nearly 1:1 atomic ratio (53.30% Sn, 46.70% S) of Sn to S, confirming the SnS stoichiometry.

The chemical composition and binding states of the as-synthesized SnS nanosheet arrays were evaluated using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The obtained data were calibrated based on the standard carbon 1s peak (284.5 eV). Fig. 2b shows the XPS survey spectrum, which reveals that the SnS nanosheet array also had some oxygen content in addition to Sn and S. This could be due to the aerial oxidation of the surface of the nanosheets. The high-resolution XPS spectra of Sn 3d and S 2p are shown in Fig. 2c and d, respectively. The peaks obtained at binding energies of 485.3 eV and 494.2 eV correspond to Sn 3d5/2 and Sn 3d3/2 spin–orbit components for Sn, respectively. Furthermore, the energy splitting gap between this doublet is 8.4 eV, which corresponds to Sn2+ in SnS, indicating a +2 oxidation state of the Sn in the SnS nanosheet film.57,58 Similarly, the doublet S 2p peaks at 160.8 and 161.6 eV (Fig. 2(d)) belong to 2p1/2 and 2p3/2, respectively. This finding indicates that S in SnS nanosheets was in the oxidation state of −2.59,60
Electrocatalytic activity of SnS film

Catalyzing oxygen evolution reaction (OER). 

Fig. 3a shows the linear sweep voltammogram (LSV) obtained at a sweeping rate of 5 mV s−1 of the as-synthesized SnS film on nickel foam (SnS/NF) in 1 M KOH aqueous electrolyte. The SnS/NF electrode demonstrated an OER overpotential of 280 mV to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm−2, which is lower than that acquired by the bare NF-substrate (440 mV). The Tafel slopes of bare NF and the SnS/NF electrodes were investigated to obtain their intrinsic OER kinetics. The corresponding Tafel slopes of 106 and 141 mV dec−1 were obtained for the NF, and the slopes of bare NF and SnS/NF electrodes were investigated to obtain their intrinsic OER kinetics (Fig. 3b). Despite a higher overpotential acquired by the bare NF, this electrode indicates a faster OER kinetics.

The cathodic polarization of bare NF and SnS/NF electrodes was assessed to study the HER performance in 1 M KOH aqueous electrolyte. The cathodic polarization curves are depicted in Fig. 3c. As expected, the SnS/NF showed higher HER catalytic performance than the bare NF-substrate. HER overpotential of 214 mV was obtained by the SnS/NF electrode to deliver a current density of −10 mA cm−2, which is smaller than that of the bare NF-substrate (241 mV). This electrocatalytic activity of OER and HER is comparable with previously reported earth-abundant catalysts (Tables S1 and S2†). Furthermore, the SnS/NF electrode also showed a smaller Tafel slope of 120 mV dec−1, while the NF-substrate electrode showed the Tafel slope of 131 mV dec−1 (Fig. 3d). This indicates the relatively faster HER kinetics on the SnS/NF electrode.


Catalyzing urea oxidation reaction (UOR). 
Based on the above OER and HER activities, the SnS/NF electrode was further evaluated for UOR and HER in 1 M KOH aqueous electrolyte containing 0.33 M urea. The UOR performance was measured in a typical three-electrode system with SCE as a reference electrode and a graphite rod as a counter electrode, as shown in Fig. S3.†Fig. 4a shows the LSV curves for the SnS/NF and the bare NF-substrate to access the UOR and OER activities. Interestingly, the voltammograms reveal that the SnS/NF electrode requires a potential of 1.37 V and 1.43 V (vs. RHE) to deliver a current density of 10 and 50 mA cm−2, respectively. On the other hand, the HER polarization curve of the SnS/NF electrode showed an overpotential of 192 mV to achieve a current density of −10 mA cm−2 (Fig. 4b), which is just 22 mV lower as compared to the one obtained when no urea was added to the KOH electrolyte. This small change in overpotential lies within the range of experimental errors.
 Fig. 4  UOR and HER performance of the NF and SnS/NF based anode and cathode in 1.0 M KOH + 0.33 M urea at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1. (a) UOR and OER polarization curves. (b) Tafel plots of the electrodes used to evaluate UOR kinetics. (c) HER polarization curves, (d) Tafel plots of the electrodes used to evaluate HER kinetics. 
Notably, during urea-oxidation (UOR), the SnS/NF electrode requires only 1.37 V and 1.43V (vs. RHE) to deliver the current densities of 10 mA cm−2 and 50 mA cm−2, respectively, while the same electrode during water oxidation (OER) requires higher potentials of 1.51 V and 1.63 V (vs. RHE) to deliver the same range of current densities. The overpotential difference between the UOR and OER suggests that the addition of urea can boost and accelerate the anodic oxidation reaction, thereby reducing the overall voltage of the electrolyzer to generate hydrogen efficiently at the cathode. This finding suggests that as compared to the overall water-splitting process, urea electrolysis offers cost-effective and energy-saving hydrogen production together with detoxification of urea-rich wastewater. The literature survey (Table S3†) indicates that the SnS/NF film of the present study exhibits excellent electrocatalytic activity towards the UOR, which lies within the best performance to those of the previously reported sulfide-based and other catalytic materials. Furthermore, Tafel assessment was executed to understand the UOR and HER kinetics of the electrodes (Fig. 4c and d). Unlike the case of OER, the SnS/NF anode in the course of UOR showed a smaller anodic Tafel slope of 59.7 mV dec−1, which is even relatively lower than that of the bare NF-anode (76.5 mV dec−1). Similarly, the SnS/NF cathode exhibited a cathodic Tafel slope of 188 mV dec−1 for HER, while the bare NF-cathode had a slope of 152 mV dec−1. These findings imply that, as compared to the bare-NF-substrate, a relatively faster UOR and HER kinetics were obtained on the SnS/NF electrode even at a smaller applied bias of the electrolyzer (Fig. 4a and b). Furthermore, a cycling test for evaluating the electrochemical durability of the electrode was conducted, which demonstrated excellent stability with a minor change in the LSV curves before and after the cycling test. Similarly, SEM images of the SnS electrode before and after the cycling test evidently show the nanosheet array features of the initial SnS film. These findings reveal that the SnS film electrode electrochemically and microscopically remained intact before and after the test (Fig. S4a and b†).
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was employed to understand the charge transfer property of the electrodes. Fig. S5a† shows the Nyquist plots, and the corresponding extracted parameters are summarized in Table S4 in the ESI.† It can be seen that a small charge transfer resistance (Rct = 2.29 Ω) was obtained for the SnS/NF as compared to the bare NF (Rct = 2.94 Ω). This indicates an improved charge transfer between the SnS electrode and the electrolyte interface. Furthermore, the electrochemical active surface (ECSA) of the electrodes was determined in terms of double-layer capacitance (Cdl). The cyclic voltammetry was obtained in a non-faradaic region in the range of 1.16 to 1.26 V vs. RHE. The Cdl is extracted from the cyclic voltammograms obtained at various sweeping rates (Fig. S5b and c†). As displayed in Fig. S5d,† the estimated Cdl, which directly relates to the corresponding ECSA of the SnS/NF and NF electrodes are 25 and 10 mF cm−2, respectively. This suggests that the SnS/NF electrode had more abundance of the electrochemically active sites as compared to the bare NF-substrate, which helped to enhance the electrocatalytic performance for OER, UOR, and HER.

Overall urea splitting and electrode durability
Based on the UOR and HER activities of the SnS/NF electrode with a graphite-rod counter electrode, the SnS/NF electrodes were evaluated toward overall urea electrolysis using the equivalent SnS/NF electrodes as anode and cathode. To control the applied bias precisely, the SCE nonpolarizable electrode was assembled together (i.e., SnS/NF∥SnS/NF vs. SCE assembly) in the electrolyzer, as shown in Fig. 5a. Fig. 5b shows the linear sweep voltammogram of the SnS/NF∥SnS/NF vs. SCE electrolyzer, where it acquired a potential of 1.37 and 1.43 V vs. RHE to deliver the current density of 10 and 50 mA cm−2, respectively in 1 M KOH aqueous electrolyte containing 0.33 M urea. The obtained results reveal a fairly outstanding catalytic activity on overall urea electrolysis (i.e., UOR∥HER at SnS/NF anode and SnS/NF cathode, respectively). Here, the cell potential obtained to drive the current density of 10 mA cm−2 was 140 mV lower than that required for the OER in alkaline 1 M KOH electrolyte. This finding, thus, shows a simple and effective way to substitute OER with UOR at the anode using the SnS/NF catalyst to reduce the overall cell potential, thereby improving the hydrogen production efficiency.

(b) Anodic linear sweep voltammogram of the electrolyzer measured at a scan rate 5 mV s−1. (c) and (d) Chronopotentiometry profiles of the respective anode and cathode of the electrolyzer, showing long-term electrochemical durability during the UOR and HER. 
Finally, to test the stability of the SnS/NF catalyst for UOR and HER, chronopotentiometry measurements were performed in 0.33 M urea added to 1 M KOH aqueous electrolyte at an applied bias of 10 mA cm−2 for 24 h. As shown in Fig. 5c and d, the electrolyzer maintained the electrolysis for 24 h with a minor rise in cell potential, showing the electrochemical robustness of the SnS/NF electrode for a 24 h continuous operation.
Conclusions
In summary, a self-standing thin film of SnS nanosheet array was deposited on the NF-substrate via a simple solution process technique. The self-supported nanosheet array-based SnS/NF electrode is demonstrated as an efficient novel metal-free bifunctional catalyst for electrochemical hydrogen generation at cathode and urea contaminated wastewater treatment at the anode of an electrolyzer. Specifically, the SnS/NF∥SnS/NF vs. SCE assembled-based electrolyzer achieved a cell potential of 1.37 and 1.43 V vs. RHE to deliver the current density of 10 and 50 mA cm−2, respectively in 1 M KOH aqueous electrolyte containing 0.33 M urea. Furthermore, the electrolyzer exhibited long-term electrochemical durability of the SnS/NF anode and cathode for 24 h of continuous electrolysis at an applied bias of 10 mA cm−2. Owing to its easy fabrication process and excellent catalytic activity, the self-standing SnS nanosheet array film has the potential to serve as a promising electrode material to decompose urea-waste electrochemically in water together with sustainable hydrogen energy production.
