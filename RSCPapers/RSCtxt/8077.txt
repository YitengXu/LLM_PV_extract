    , Accepted 23rd January 2015First published on 26th January 2015AbstractThe size effect of the TiO2 photoanode has been investigated on the hole-conductor-free fully printable mesoscopic perovskite solar cells based on the carbon counter electrode and (5-AVA)x(MA)1−xPbI3 perovskite. With TiO2 nanoparticles with an optimized diameter of 25 nm, a champion device exhibits an efficiency of 13.41%.
Due to the exhaustion of fossil fuels and aggravation of environmental pollution problems, the development of clean and renewable energy is becoming more and more urgent. Solar energy is considered as the most promising source of renewable energy due to its abundance and availability. Although planar junction devices, usually made of silicon, have dominated the commercial market over the past decades, these photovoltaic technologies still have constraints in market development on account of both the expensive materials and the complex manufacturing processes.1,2 Realizing the full potential of the vast solar energy market requires a new generation of photovoltaic devices that are both efficient and low-cost, and mesoscopic solar cells have become the object of ongoing investigation. Different from traditional silicon solar cells, the charge separation and transfer of mesoscopic solar cells take place in two different materials,3 allowing adequate space for the development of novel materials to improve the performance of the device.
As the key component of mesoscopic solar cells, mesoporous films based on wide band gap semiconductor materials have attracted more and more interest owing to their fascinating properties such as tunable pore sizes, high surface areas, controllable framework compositions, and stable characteristics, as well as their wide promising applications.4–7 Their multifarious morphologies such as nanoparticles,8,9 nanowires,10,11 nanosheets,12 nanotubes,13,14 spheres15,16 and some other mesoscopic structures17–21 are widely used in dye-sensitized solar cells, one of the typical mesoscopic solar cells. Until now, a high certified efficiency of 11.9% has been obtained in dye-sensitized solar cells based on the TiO2 nanocrystalline mesoscopic structure and liquid electrolyte.22
Stemming from dye-sensitized solar cells, organometal trihalide perovskite solar cells, pioneered by Miyasaka and coworkers,23 have emerged as a promising technology with a mesoscopic structure in the past two years. Normally, these perovskite based mesoscopic solar cells are composed of a mesoscopic layer such as TiO2 as an electron collector, an organometal trihalide perovskite such as CH3NH3PbI3 as a light absorber, a hole transport material (HTM) such as spiro-OMeTAD as a electronic block layer and a noble metal film such as Au as a counter electrode. Presently, a high certificated efficiency up to 20.1% was obtained.24 Indeed, the HTM of spiro-OMeTAD and the noble counter electrode of Au in the device are so expensive and will be a great obstacle for future commercial applications.
In our group, we have developed a hole-conductor-free mesoscopic perovskite solar cell, in which the mesoscopic TiO2 layer, ZrO2 layer and carbon counter electrode layer are printed layer by layer and the perovskite is dropped into the trilayer mesoscopic films. This design combines the low-cost of mesoscopic solar cells, the continuous production process and promises extensive application prospect. A high certified efficiency up to 12.84% and long stabilization were obtained with (5-AVA)x(MA)1−xPbI3 based mesoscopic solar cells.25 However, as the key component of mesoscopic solar cells, the size effect of TiO2 nanoparticles on the mesoscopic perovskite solar cells is very important to the characterization of devices, there is no paper reported about it in a perovskite based solar cell. In this work, TiO2 nanoparticles with different sizes have been synthesized and the size effect on the mesoscopic perovskite solar cell is investigated. With the TiO2 nanoparticles with an optimized diameter of 25 nm, a maximum efficiency of 13.41% was achieved in the hole-conductor-free, fully printable mesoscopic perovskite solar cells with the carbon counter electrode.

Fig. 1 shows the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of different sized TiO2 nanoparticles prepared by a simple hydrothermal method. It could be found that the size of the nanoparticles ranges from several to several tens of nanometers. The size of TiO2 nanoparticles in the samples (a), (b), (c) and (d) was calculated from the average values of a set of at least twenty samples. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of TiO2 nanoparticles with different sizes are shown in Fig. S1.† The peaks at 25.26°, 37.77°, 48.00°, 53.86°, 54.98°, and 62.65° correspond to (101), (004), (200), (105), (211) and (204), which are in good agreement with the standard anatase TiO2 crystal structure. The particle size is calculated using Debye–Scherrer's law,D = Kλ/βcosθwhere D is the particle diameter, K is a constant, λ is the wavelength of Cu Kα radiation, β is the full width at half-maximum (FWHM) in radians, and θ is the scattering angle. According to the FWHM of the strongest (101) diffraction peak, the estimated particle diameters for the four kinds of TiO2 nanoparticles are about 15 nm, 20 nm, 25 nm and 30 nm, respectively. These results are in good agreement with the size determination of the TiO2 nanoparticles derived from TEM. As shown in Table 1, the BET specific surface area of 15 nm nanoparticles is 139.8 m2 g−1, which has a pore size of 14.7 nm and porosity as high as 66.8%. With the increase of the size of TiO2 nanoparticles, the pore size is increased simultaneously, but the specific surface area and the porosity decreased. When the particle size is 30 nm, the specific surface area and the porosity present the smallest value of 59.6 m2 g−1 and 60.1%, respectively.

Fig. 2a shows a schematic structure of the carbon electrode based mesoscopic perovskite solar cell. A typical sandwich structure composed of a mesoscopic TiO2 nanocrystalline layer, a mesoscopic ZrO2 spacer layer and a mesoscopic carbon layer is constructed on a FTO glass substrate with a full printing technology. The cross-sectional image of the fully printable mesoscopic perovskite solar cell is presented in Fig. S2,† which indicates that a 0.95 μm TiO2 nanocrystalline layer, a 1.65 μm ZrO2 insulating layer and a 13.05 μm carbon layer are layered on the FTO glass, and the perovskite is filled in the triple mesoscopic layers. The corresponding energy levels of TiO2, perovskite, ZrO2 and carbon are illustrated in Fig. 2b. Energy levels are expressed in electron volts (eV) using the vacuum level as a reference. The conduction band edges of TiO2, ZrO2, and MAPbI3 are at −4.0, −3.4 and −3.9 eV, respectively, while the valence band edge of MAPbI3 is at −5.4 eV and the Fermi level of carbon is at −5.0 eV. The photo-generated electron–hole pairs are separated by injecting electrons into TiO2 and transporting holes to the carbon and then forming photocurrent in the device. Since there is an offset of 0.6 eV between the conduction band of TiO2 and that of ZrO2, the electrons in the perovskite conduction band could only be injected into TiO2. In addition, the TiO2 compact layer deposited on the FTO glass substrates block holes on the valence band of perovskite.

Photoanodes based on different sized TiO2 nanoparticles were used to investigate the size effect on the performance of hole-conductor-free, fully printable mesoscopic perovskite solar cells. After assembling the mesoscopic perovskite solar cell with different sized TiO2 nanoparticles, four key parameters of short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (FF) and power conversion efficiency (η) are summarized in Fig. S3,† where each dataset is carried out from at least ten mesoscopic perovskite solar cells. It could be found that the Jsc of the devices with 20 nm sized TiO2 have a maximum value. As the diameter of the particles increases from 15 nm to 20 nm, the Jsc increases from 21.1 mA cm−2 to 23.3 mA cm−2. Because of the narrow tunnels in the 15 nm TiO2 mesoscopic framework, the perovskite cannot penetrate into the bottom of the TiO2 layer easily. When the TiO2 nanoparticles increase to 20 nm, the improved pore filling caused by a larger pore size leads to an improvement of the Jsc. However, with the size further increasing to 30 nm, the Jsc presents a little bit lower value, which may be ascribed to the reduction of the porosity. Since the reduction of porosity means lower filling amounts of perovskite in the mesoscopic TiO2 framework and this would ultimately result in a reduction of Jsc. As shown in Fig. S3c,† the FF increases from 0.52 to 0.61, the reason may be attributed to the reduction in electron transport resistance of the TiO2 mesoscopic structure and better filling of the perovskite solution, which are both caused by the further increased size of the TiO2 nanoparticles. As a result of a compromise between Voc, Jsc and the FF, the maximum of the average power conversion efficiency of about 11.31% was achieved when the TiO2 nanoparticles were 25 nm. Fig. S4† presents the J–V curve of a champion device of a hole-conductor-free, fully printable mesoscopic perovskite solar cell, which is based on 25 nm TiO2 nanoparticles and indicates an efficiency of 13.41% with a Jsc of 22.93 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.867 V and a FF of 0.67.
In order to extract quantitative information on the yield of light-induced charge separation, we performed time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) decay measurements on the (5-AVA)x(MA)1−xPbI3 perovskite-filled TiO2 mesoscopic films with four different sized TiO2 nanoparticles, respectively, which are presented in Fig. 3. With global biexponential fits, the PL decay of the (5-AVA)x(MA)1−xPbI3 perovskite contained in 15 nm, 20 nm, 25 nm and 30 nm sized TiO2 films exhibits a time-constant of τ1 = 7.43 ns, 4.73 ns, 3.36 ns and 2.13 ns respectively, which means that with an increase in the diameter of the TiO2 nanoparticles from 15 nm to 30 nm, the rate of the electron injection from perovskite into TiO2 becomes faster, resulting in a higher electron injection quantum efficiency after the electron–hole separation. This could be attributed to the better filling of the (5-AVA)x(MA)1−xPbI3 perovskite within the mesoscopic TiO2 films and the more complete contact between the TiO2 and the perovskite as the size of TiO2 increased.

The charge transport mechanism within the nanocrystalline semiconductor films of the photoanode could be detected by the intensity modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) measurement. Fig. S5† presents the IMPS curves of the photoanode of different sized TiO2 nanoparticles. The transport time τd of the injected electrons through the TiO2 film can be calculated from the equation  where fd,min is the characteristic frequency at the minimum of the IMPS imaginary component. The simulation results show that τd values are estimated to be 2.1 × 10−6 s, 1.209 × 10−6 s, 1.160 × 10−6 s and 1.104 × 10−6 s in the devices with the TiO2 nanoparticles of 15 nm, 20 nm, 25 nm and 30 nm, respectively. In addition, the electron diffusion coefficient Dn could be calculated from the equation  where d is the thickness of the photoanode. Therefore, the Dn in the TiO2 films with a thickness of 0.95 μm with the TiO2 nanoparticles of 15 nm, 20 nm, 25 nm and 30 nm are calculated to be 1.83 × 10−3, 3.20 × 10−3, 3.31 × 10−3 and 3.48 × 10−3 cm2 s−1 respectively. It is clear that the charge transport within the film based on larger TiO2 nanoparticles is faster than that of the smaller TiO2 nanoparticles, which suggests that the charge collection efficiency of the mesoscopic solar cell could be improved by larger sized TiO2 nanoparticles.
The characterization of the charge transport and electron–hole recombination in mesoscopic perovskite solar cell, of which the TiO2 layer was composed of different sized TiO2 nanoparticles, was obtained by the intensity modulated photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS) measurement. Fig. 4a shows the typical Nyquist plots of IMVS characterization. The electron lifetime τn is measured as a function of photovoltage, calculated using the equation  where fn,min is the frequency of the minimum of the semicircle in the IMVS plots. In general, the longer lifetime of excited electron indicates a slower recombination rate and the higher conduction band electron density, which is related to a higher value of Voc.26 The values of electron lifetime τn are presented in Fig. 4b, which are estimated to be 6.64 × 10−5 s, 5.91 × 10−5 s, 4.56 × 10−5 s and 4.27 × 10−5 s for the devices prepared from 15 nm, 20 nm, 25 nm and 30 nm sized TiO2 particles, respectively. This indicates that the electron lifetime in the perovskite solar cell decreases with the increase in size of TiO2 nanoparticles.

The kinetics characterization of charge transfer at the interface between the perovskite and mesoscopic TiO2 of devices based on different sized TiO2 nanoparticles was carried out with electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis, which was collected in the frequency range of 0.1 Hz to 1 MHz at −0.7 V under dark conditions. Fig. 5 presents the Nyquist plot, where an obvious semicircle at low frequency and a much smaller arc at high frequency (in the inset) are observed in the measured frequency range. The smaller arc at high frequency is assigned to the charge transfer/transport resistance (Rsc) due to the selective contact or the interface, and the arc at low frequency is assigned to the interfacial and/or bulk recombination, Rrec.27,28 The inset presents the first semicircle at high frequency with high magnification, which shows a similar semicircle and indicates that the devices based on different sized TiO2 nanoparticles have a similar Rsc, The beginning x-intercept of the curve, corresponding to a series resistance, decreases with the increase in size of TiO2 nanoparticles, which agrees well with the result of the IMPS in Fig. S5.† Meanwhile, at low frequency the device based on 15 nm TiO2 nanoparticles shows the largest arc, indicating that the Rrec of the device is the highest among these four kinds of solar cells. It also could be found that with the increase in size of TiO2 nanoparticles, the Rrec becomes smaller and the device based on 30 nm sized TiO2 nanoparticles presents the smallest value. This could be attributed to the electronic contact between the TiO2 and the carbon electrode, which increases the recombination of electrons and holes. This also certifies that the device with an increased TiO2 size presents a lower Voc and Jsc.

Conclusions
In summary, different sized TiO2 nanoparticles were synthesized by a hydrothermal method and applied as an electron collector on the hole-conductor-free fully printable mesoscopic perovskite solar cells based on carbon counter electrode and (5-AVA)x(MA)1−xPbI3 perovskite materials. The size effect of TiO2 nanoparticles on carbon counter electrode based mesoscopic perovskite solar cells was investigated. The results indicate that the size of TiO2 particles not only affects the infiltration of the precursor and the contact between the perovskite crystal and TiO2, but also significantly influences the charge transfer kinetics at the perovskite/TiO2 interface. With TiO2 nanoparticles with an optimized diameter of 25 nm, the carbon counter electrode based perovskite mesoscopic solar cell exhibits the best power conversion efficiency of 13.41% in ambient air under simulated standard AM 1.5 conditions.
