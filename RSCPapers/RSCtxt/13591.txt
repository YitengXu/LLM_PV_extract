    , Accepted 14th October 2019First published on 15th October 2019AbstractA WO3/g-C3N4 composite photocatalyst with 2D–2D heterostructure was designed and constructed to boost the visible light performance for degradation of organic pollutants by an in situ preparation strategy. The degradation of RhB as a model reaction was used to evaluate the photocatalytic activity of the WO3/g-C3N4 photocatalyst. The optimized mass fraction of WO3 is 13% for the WO3/g-C3N4 composite photocatalyst, namely the CNW-13 sample, which can almost completely degrade the pollutant in 40 min under 70 W metal halide lamp irradiation. The different contents of WO3/g-C3N4 composite photocatalysts were investigated in detail by a series of detailed characterization measurements. Based on the trapped active species and photoelectrochemical experiments, the enhanced photocatalytic performance of WO3/g-C3N4 can be ascribed to the formation of a Z-scheme system to accelerate the separation and transfer of photo-generated charge carriers. Furthermore, the major active species, superoxide radical (˙O2−), also can be determined by active species-trapping experiments. It is expected that our current work could provide a counterpart to further develop the efficient composite photocatalysts in practical applications.
1 Introduction
Semiconductor-based photocatalysis is regarded as one of the strategies with the most potential to resolve the energy and environmental issues.1–6 Despite considerable efforts having been carried out for photocatalytic technological innovation, the construction of highly efficient semiconductor photocatalysts for practical applications still is a challenge.7–12 So far, many wide band-gap semiconductor materials such as TiO2, ZnO and SrTiO3, due to the lower solar conversion efficiency, have been severely limited for the applications of environmental remediation.13–16 Herein, it is an urgent demand to develop the efficient visible-light-driven composite materials.
In recent years, the graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4), attributed to facile synthesis, inexpensiveness, favorable electronic structure, nontoxicity and high stability, has received significant attention.17,18 The unique physical and chemical properties of g-C3N4 can be devoted to a wide range of applications, such as photocatalysis, electrocatalysis and thermocatalysis.19–21 Chen et al.22 reported that defect engineered g-C3N4 showed efficient visible light absorption, higher surface area and lower rate of electron–hole recombination to improve the hydrogen production performance. Shiraishi et al.23 found that the graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) displayed a high selectivity for H2O2 in an alcohol/water mixture under visible light irradiation, which is due to the efficient formation of a 1,4-endoperoxide species on the g-C3N4 surface. These results demonstrate that g-C3N4 is a great potential photocatalyst, but the single g-C3N4 photocatalyst still does not satisfy the practical requirements with relatively low solar conversion efficiency. The photocatalytic efficiency of g-C3N4 still is lower because of weak electronic conductivity, high electron–hole pair recombination rate, and high surface inertness.24 Herein, many strategies such as metal and non-metal doping, deposition of noble metals, and constructing semiconductor composites and heterojunctions have been carried out to improve the photocatalytic efficiency of g-C3N4.25–30 Among them, constructing a semiconductor composite is one of the most effective methods to boost the photocatalytic activity. Namely, two suitable semiconductors are coupled to design and fabricate the heterostructure, which can accelerate the separation and transfer of photogenerated charge carriers to improve photocatalytic performance. Zou found18 that the enhanced photocatalytic activity for CeO2/g-C3N4 is attributed to the formation of built-in electric field, which can provide efficient separation and transfer of photo-generated electrons. Yu et al.31 reported that a direct Z-scheme g-C3N4/WO3 photocatalyst with host–guest architecture was rationally designed and they could form a built-in electric field at the interface to accelerate the transfer of photoexcited electrons. Herein, an effective strategy where one or more kinds of suitable semiconductors are chosen to construct the heterostructure using a g-C3N4-based photocatalyst will be widely promoted.
Among these semiconductor photocatalysts, tungsten oxide (WO3) is a particularly suitable candidate due to its narrow band gap, high stability, non-toxicity and low cost.32,33 In addition, the WO3 photocatalyst displays a high oxidative power due to the valence band (VB) holes, which is more beneficial to the photocatalytic oxidative reaction process.34 However, it is a critical issue that the high recombination rate of photo-generated charge carriers severely restricts the further applications of the WO3 nanomaterials.35 Interestingly, the g-C3N4 and WO3 possess a matched band-gap position, and their heterostructure can easily form a Z-scheme system to promote the separation and transfer of photo-generated electron–hole pairs. As we all know, the valence band (VB) position of g-C3N4 is about 1.5 eV (vs. NHE), and the conduction band (CB) position of WO3 is about 0.7 eV (vs. NHE). Herein, a Z-scheme system for a WO3/g-C3N4 composite photocatalyst may be formed, which is due to the short distance between the VB of g-C3N4 and the CB of WO3.36,37 Chai et al.38 reported that the Z-scheme of WO3/g-C3N4 composite photocatalysts displayed an excellent photocatalytic activity for the degradation of RhB under visible light irradiation. Zou et al.39 found that hierarchical WO3/g-C3N4 composite hollow microspheres could be constructed through precisely controlled in situ hydrolysis and a polymerization process consecutively, and showed an excellent photocatalytic activity for the degradation of antibiotics. In addition, the synergy of adsorption and visible-light photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue by the WO3/g-C3N4 photocatalyst was also reported by Chen et al.40 These previous reports demonstrate that the WO3/g-C3N4 composite material is a highly promising photocatalyst, but the complex preparation process, high-cost light source and low efficiency are unsolved problems. Taking into consideration the practical applications, the development of a facile and low cost preparation strategy, instead of a high-cost Xe-arc lamp method, still is a challenge.
In this work, a WO3/g-C3N4 composite photocatalyst was constructed by an in situ preparation strategy. The photocatalytic activity was evaluated by the degradation of RhB under visible light irradiation, in which a 70 W metal halide lamp (Philips Electronics) with a 420 nm cutoff filter was used as the light source to ensure the irradiation with visible light only. Furthermore, the structure and properties of the WO3/g-C3N4 composite photocatalyst were investigated in detail by a series of characterizations, such as XRD, IR, SEM and photoelectrochemical measurements. Eventually, a Z-scheme mechanism for WO3/g-C3N4 composite photocatalyst to promote the photocatalytic activity can be proposed.
2 Experimental
2.1 Catalyst preparation
g-C3N4: g-C3N4 was prepared by thermal polycondensation of dicyandiamide. In a typical preparation process, 5 g dicyandiamide was put into a crucible with a cover. Then, it was further placed in a muffle furnace using a heating rate of 2.3 °C min−1 and kept at 500 °C for 4 h. The as-prepared sample was then allowed to cool to room temperature before removal from the furnace. Finally, yellow products were obtained after calcination.
WO3/g-C3N4: in a typical procedure, 0.38–0.73 mmol (0.38 mmol, 0.47 mmol, 0.56 mmol, 0.65 mmol and 0.73 mmol) Na2WO4·2H2O and 1.224 mmol NH4F were together added into 12.5 mL deionized water and continuously stirred. Then, 12.5 mL 2 mol L−1 HCl solution was slowly added into the above solution drop by drop. In addition, 1.53 mmol oxalic acid was dissolved into 25 mL deionized water. The above two solutions were mixed, and 1 g g-C3N4 was further added into the above solution. Subsequently, the mixture was uninterruptedly stirred for 1 hour and transferred into a 60 mL Teflon autoclave, which was kept at 90 °C for 3 h. After the hydrothermal reaction, the WO3·H2O/g-C3N4 sample was obtained, and it was dried at 60 °C for 12 h. Finally, the WO3·H2O/g-C3N4 sample was calcined at 500 °C for 1 h, and the WO3/g-C3N4 sample was gained. The mass contents of WO3 in the WO3/g-C3N4 composite materials were adjusted to be 9%, 11%, 13%, 15%, and 17%, which were labeled as CNW-9, CNW-11, CNW-13, CNW-15 and CNW-17, respectively. In addition, WO3 was prepared by the above experimental method, but without adding the g-C3N4.
2.2 Characterization of samples
XRD plots were measured on a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å). The IR experiments were carried out on a Nicolet 670 FT-IR spectrometer, and the samples were prepared as KBr pellets. UV-vis DRS spectra were taken on a Varian Cary 500 Scan UV-vis-NIR spectrometer with BaSO4 as the reference. A Hitachi New Generation SU8000 field emission scanning electron microscope (SEM) was employed to obtain the SEM images. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were recorded using an FL/FS 920 (Edinburgh Instruments) equipped with a 450 W Xe arc lamp as the excitation source and a red sensitive Peltier element cooled Hamamatsu R2658 PMT as the detector. Excited state lifetimes of the charge carriers were measured with the Delta Pro (HORIBA instruments) using a 357 nm laser as the excitation source and employing a time correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) technique.
2.3 Photoelectrochemical measurement
Photocurrent was measured using the conventional three-electrode electrochemical cell with a working electrode, a platinum foil counter electrode and an Ag/AgCl electrode as the reference electrode. The working electrode was fabricated on an FTO glass: 10 mg of sample was mixed with 0.5 mL ethanol with continuous stirring for 3 h to get a slurry. Then, 20 μL of the slurry was spread onto an FTO glass, whose side part was previously protected by Scotch tape, and the electrode was dried at room temperature for 24 h. In the experiment, the three electrodes were immersed in a sodium sulfate electrolyte solution (0.5 M) and the working electrode was irradiated by the visible light (λ  420 nm). The light/dark short circuit photocurrent response and electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were recorded using an electrochemical workstation (CHI 660E).
2.4 Photocatalytic activity measurement
The photocatalytic performance of the as-prepared samples was evaluated by the degradation of RhB in aqueous solution. A 70 W metal halide lamp (Philips Electronics) with a 420 nm cutoff filter was used as the light source to ensure the irradiation with visible light only. Typically, 80 mg of the photocatalyst was added into 80 mL of 10 mg L−1 RhB aqueous solution in a container. Prior to irradiation, the suspensions were magnetically stirred in the dark for 60 min to ensure the establishment of an adsorption/desorption equilibrium between the photocatalyst and RhB. At given irradiation time intervals, 4 mL of suspension was collected and centrifuged to remove the photocatalyst particles, and the residual RhB solution was analyzed by monitoring variations at the wavelength of maximal absorption (554 nm) in the UV-vis spectra.
2.5 Active species trapping experiments
In order to probe the active species generated in the photocatalytic reaction process, isopropanol (IPA), EDTA-2Na, Cr(VI) and p-benzoquinone (BQ) as the scavengers of hydroxyl radicals (˙OH), holes (h+), electrons (e−) and superoxide radicals (˙O2−) were, respectively, added into the RhB solution to study the influence of different active species. The concentrations of IPA, EDTA-2Na, Cr(VI) and BQ were 1 mmol L−1, 125 mg L−1, 1 mmol L−1, 1 mmol L−1, respectively. The photocatalytic degradation reaction was similar to the above test conditions except for the addition of scavengers into the RhB solution.
3 Results and discussion

Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of all of the as-prepared samples. Obviously, the pure g-C3N4 sample shows the characteristic diffraction peaks at 27.4° and 13.0°, which are assigned to (002) and (100) planes of the g-C3N4, respectively.15 After introduction of WO3 nanosheets, there appear some new diffraction peaks at 23.1°, 23.6°, and 24.4° which are assigned to (002), (020), and (200) crystal planes of monoclinic WO3 (JCPDS No. 43-1035), respectively.41 Meanwhile, it can be seen that there is no obvious change over the characteristic diffraction peaks of g-C3N4 in WO3/g-C3N4 composite photocatalysts, suggesting that the preparation process does not alter the crystalline structure of g-C3N4. In order to further verify the existence of WO3, all of the as-prepared samples were investigated by FT-IR spectra, as shown in Fig. 2. Obviously, the pure g-C3N4 has characteristic absorption peaks at 1640 cm−1, which is assigned to C–N stretching vibration modes of g-C3N4.42 The four peaks at 1240 cm−1, 1322 cm−1, 1406 cm−1 and 1567 cm−1 are ascribed to aromatic C–N stretching of g-C3N4, and 812 and 886 cm−1 correspond to the vibration modes of the s-triazine ring unit.38,42,43 Furthermore, a peak at 735 cm−1 can be observed, which is assigned to the vibration of the W–O–W bond.38 Based on the above results, it can be found that the WO3 is successfully introduced into g-C3N4 to prepare the WO3/g-C3N4 composite photocatalysts.

Fig. 3 shows the SEM images of g-C3N4, CNW-11 and CNW-13 samples. For the pure g-C3N4 sample, the morphology of a block-like shape with relatively smooth surface can be clearly observed. Meanwhile, it can be seen from Fig. 3a and b that the big particles or small nanosheets are almost non-existent on the surface of pure g-C3N4. When the WO3 nanosheets were introduced, the surface of the CNW-11 sample appears as many small nanosheets, namely WO3 nanosheets. Similarly, this phenomenon can be observed in the CNW-13 sample, as presented in Fig. 3d. To further demonstrate the 2D–2D structure of the WO3/g-C3N4 composite photocatalyst, the TEM measurement was employed to investigate, as shown in Fig. S1 (see ESI†). It can be seen that the WO3 and g-C3N4 form an intimate 2D–2D structure. The UV-vis diffuse reflectance adsorption spectra were obtained to investigate the optical adsorption properties of all the as-obtained samples, as presented in Fig. S2 (ESI†). As we all know, the band gaps of g-C3N4 and WO3 are ca. 2.7 eV44 and ca. 2.6–2.7 eV,45 respectively. Because the band gap of g-C3N4 is similar to the band gap of WO3, the absorption edge of WO3/g-C3N4 composite photocatalysts with different contents is not obviously changed in comparison to that of the pure g-C3N4 sample.

The photocatalytic activity of g-C3N4, WO3 and WO3/g-C3N4 samples under visible light irradiation was investigated by the degradation of RhB, as displayed in Fig. 4. As expected, the WO3/g-C3N4 composite photocatalysts exhibit excellent photocatalytic activity compared to those of nude g-C3N4 and WO3 samples. With the content of WO3 increasing in the WO3/g-C3N4 composite photocatalysts, the photocatalytic activity of WO3/g-C3N4 photocatalysts gradually improved and the optimized photocatalyst was the CNW-13 sample. The optimized CNW-13 sample displayed the highest degradation rate among those of CNW-9, CNW-11, CNW-15 and CNW-17 samples, and can completely degrade the RhB in 40 min under 70 W metal halide lamp irradiation. To verify the degradation ability of the WO3/g-C3N4 composite photocatalyst, methyl orange (MO) and methylene blue (MB) also were selected as the targeted pollutants. Obviously, the WO3/g-C3N4 composite photocatalyst also displayed the excellent photocatalytic activity for degradation of MO and MB, as shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†). In order to further explore the stability of WO3/g-C3N4 composite photocatalysts, the CNW-13 sample was continuously investigated under visible light irradiation, as shown in Fig. 5. There appears a slight decrease for the RhB degradation efficiency of the CNW-13 sample after four cycles, suggesting that the WO3/g-C3N4 composite photocatalyst possesses high stability and reusability. These results suggest that the WO3/g-C3N4 composite photocatalysts have a certain application value.

The trapping experiments for active species were carried out during the photocatalytic reaction process in the presence of the CNW-13 photocatalyst to explore the possible reaction pathways, as displayed in Fig. 6. It can be found that the photocatalytic degradation efficiency of RhB was not influenced by the addition of 125 mg L−1 EDTA-2Na (a quencher of h+), indicating that h+ is not the major active species in this photocatalytic reaction process. Meanwhile, no obvious inhibiting action can be found using 1 mmol L−1 isopropanol (IPA) as the scavenger to quench the ˙OH, but the degradation rate of RhB decreased to a certain extent. This result manifests that the ˙OH can influence the photocatalytic reaction process, but it is not the major active species. When 1 mmol L−1 Cr(VI) was added into the RhB solution in the presence of the CNW-13 sample, the degradation rate of RhB was slightly inhibited, suggesting that the e− played an important role in the photocatalytic reaction process. Interestingly, it can be seen that the degradation of RhB was completely inhibited after the addition of 1 mmol L−1 BQ. Furthermore, we all know that the BQ is used as a scavenger to quench the superoxide radical (˙O2−). Therefore, it can be concluded that the e− and ˙O2− were the main active species, and played an important role in the photocatalytic reaction process.

The recombination rate and migration route of photogenerated charge carriers are the key determining factors that can restrict the photocatalytic activity of the photocatalyst.46 As we all know, the generation and transfer of photo-generated electron–hole pairs in the photocatalytic process can be indirectly monitored by photoelectrochemical measurement. Generally speaking, the photocurrent intensity can reflect the separation efficiency of photoexcited electron–hole pairs, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) can directly reflect an effective charge carrier separation and a fast interfacial charge transfer process.47 To more deeply understand the enhanced photocatalytic mechanism, photoelectrochemical measurement was employed to investigate, as displayed in Fig. 7. Fig. 7(a) shows the transient photocurrent response of nude g-C3N4 and WO3/g-C3N4 composite photocatalysts. The photocurrent was generated by the as-obtained photoelectrodes for several on–off cycles of visible light irradiation. Apparently, the CNW-13 sample shows the highest photocurrent density among those of nude g-C3N4, CNW-9, CNW-11, CNW-15 and CNW-17 samples, suggesting that its separation and transfer efficiency of photo-generated charge carriers is the fastest. Furthermore, the photo-generated charge transfer was further demonstrated by EIS, as shown in Fig. 7(b). A stronger transportation ability of charge carriers can be directly reflected by a smaller radius of the semicircle.48 The diameter of the arc radius on the EIS Nyquist plot of the CNW-13 sample is smaller than those of the other as-obtained samples, suggesting the outcome of increased charge carrier separation, and the enhanced charge carrier mobility in accordance with the photocurrent transient response. To further confirm the results, the fluorescence lifetimes of the g-C3N4 and CNW-13 samples were determined from the decay curves, as shown in Fig. 8. Fitting the curves with a three exponential equation, it was calculated that the average lifetimes were equal to 0.93 ns and 1.30 ns for g-C3N4 and CNW-13 samples, respectively. These results clearly demonstrate that the introduction of WO3 nanosheets can obviously accelerate the separation and transfer efficiency of photo-generated charge carriers, consequently improving the photocatalytic performance of g-C3N4.

Taking into consideration the above results, the enhanced photocatalytic mechanism is shown in Scheme 1. A possible Z-scheme mechanism for improved separation and transfer efficiency of photogenerated charge carriers in the WO3/g-C3N4 composite photocatalyst was proposed. The WO3 and g-C3N4 nanosheets were simultaneously irradiated by visible light. On the basis of the previous reports, it is well known that the conduction band (CB) and valence band (VB) positions of WO3 are 0.77 and 3.54 eV, and the CB and VB positions of g-C3N4 are −1.19 and 1.54 eV, respectively.39 If the separation and transfer pathway of photo-generated electron–hole pairs follows the type II heterojunction, the electrons in the CB position of g-C3N4 will be transferred to the CB position of WO3 and holes in the VB position of WO3 will be transferred to VB position of g-C3N4. However, when the electrons were transferred to the CB position of WO3, it had not enough ability to reduce O2 into the superoxide radical (˙O2−), because it possessed more positive potential than the potential of O2/˙O2− (−0.33 eV vs. NHE). Similarly, the H2O also can not be oxidised into ˙OH.36 Therefore, the enhanced photocatalytic performance can be reasonably explained by the Z-scheme mechanism, namely, the photo-generated electrons in the CB position of WO3 can be transferred to VB position of g-C3N4 due to the short transmission distance.36 Meanwhile, the photo-generated electrons in the CB position of g-C3N4 can facilely reduce O2 into the superoxide radical (˙O2−) to participate in the photocatalytic reaction process.

4 Conclusions
In this work, a WO3/g-C3N4 composite photocatalyst with 2D–2D heterostructure was designed and constructed by an in situ preparation strategy. The optimized mass fraction of WO3 is 13% for the WO3/g-C3N4 composite photocatalyst, which displays an excellent visible light performance and can almost completely remove the pollutant in 40 min. The 2D–2D structure of the WO3/g-C3N4 composite photocatalyst can be confirmed by SEM measurement. The photoelectrochemical and PL measurements suggest that introduction of WO3 nanosheets obviously enhances the separation and transfer efficiency of photo-generated charge carriers in the WO3/g-C3N4 composite photocatalyst. It is found that ˙O2− is the major active species from the active species trapping experiment. On the basis of a series of detailed characterization measurements, a Z-scheme mechanism was proposed to explain the enhanced photocatalytic performance. This work provides a facile strategy to design and fabricate efficient composite photocatalysts for environmental purification.
