    , Accepted 4th January 2017First published on 4th January 2017AbstractPhotovoltaic performance of planar perovskite hybrid solar cells (pero-HSCs) has been improved by mixing CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x and an electron donor polymer [N-9′′-hepta-decanyl-2,7-carbazole-alt-5,5-(4′,7′-di-2-thienyl-2′,1′,3′-benzothiadiaz-ole)] (PCDTBT). PCDTBT contains lone pairs of electrons due to the presence of S and N atoms, which could passivate the trap states of the perovskite layer and thus reduce the number of film defects. A Stonehenge-like structure could be formed by the interaction of CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x and PCDTBT, developing more ordered orientation crystallization and a high quality film morphology. The doped solar cells are characterized by their excellent photovoltaic properties and enhanced stability. When the doping concentration is 0.3 mg mL−1, the fabricated solar cell device exhibits an outstanding power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 15.76%, which represents a significant improvement with respect to the magnitude of 16% obtained for the reference device.
Introduction
In the last five years, perovskite hybrid solar cells (pero-HSCs) manufactured from organic–inorganic halide materials have attracted significant attention due to their wide absorption band, outstanding charge carrier mobility, and high diffusion length.1–4 During such a short time, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) has skyrocketed over 20%,5,6 while their planar device architectures have developed rapidly, owing to the simplicity of fabrication.7–10 Organic–inorganic halide perovskite materials possess ambipolar transport characteristics that are capable of simultaneously delivering holes and electrons to respective electrodes, thus playing a dual role of light absorbers and ambipolar charge transporters in pero-HSCs. Despite numerous advantages, some problems preventing PCE from achieving higher values still exist due to the mismatch between the diffusion lengths of the corresponding electrons and holes11 and the uncontrollable crystal quality during the fabrication process. Currently utilized one-step solution methods in planar structure devices produce defects and rough film surfaces, leading to a poor contact between the layers and a large interface resistance, which deteriorate the electron transport efficiency and photovoltaic performance of pero-HSCs.12,13 To overcome these difficulties, various methods involving interface modification as well as material doping and replacement have been proposed.14–18
[N-9′′-Hepta-decanyl-2,7-carbazole-alt-5,5-(4′,7′-di-2-thienyl-2′,1′,3′-benzothiadiaz-ole)] (PCDTBT) is a superior P-type material, which is widely used in organic polymer solar cells. As previously reported, its highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level is −5.45 eV,19 which perfectly matches that of CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x (−5.5 eV). It exhibits broad absorption in the visible range20 and the internal quantum efficiency of the PCDTBT-containing polymer solar cell approaches 100%.21 Furthermore, addition of PCDTBT promotes the stability of organic polymer solar cells in air.22,23 The repeating unit of PCDTBT possesses lone electron pairs attached to its S and N atoms, which can potentially passivate the under-coordinated Pb ions in the perovskite film.24 The under-coordinated Pb ions in perovskite crystals would serve as electron traps and increase the probability of the charge recombination due to the presence of positive charge defects,25 and controlling the amount of Pb can effectively improve the device performance.26
In this work, a perovskite light absorption layer was doped with PCDTBT (in Fig. 1(a)) to investigate its effect on the performance of pero-HSCs. As a result, high-grade films with a bigger crystal grain size and higher density were produced, and substantial improvements in their short circuit current density (JSC), open circuit voltage (VOC) and fill factor (FF) characteristics were observed. The maximum PCE of the device fabricated from the doped material reaches 15.76%, which represented a remarkable improvement with respect to the magnitude of 16% for the reference device.

Materials and preparation
PCDTBT and [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) were purchased from Luminescence Technology Corp. Solenne BV. Poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene):poly(4-styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) was purchased from Heraeus (Germany). Bphen was purchased from Nichem Fine Technology Co Ltd. (Taiwan). PbCl2 (99.99%), HI (99%), and N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, 99.9%) were purchased from Alfa-Aesar Ltd. All the materials were used without further purification. PCBM was dissolved in 1,2-dichlorobenzene (Sigma-Aldrich) at a concentration of 20 mg mL−1. Hydroiodic acid (57 wt% in H2O) and methylamine (40% in methanol) were stirred in an ice bath for 1 h and the mixture was evaporated at 55 °C for 1 h. The product obtained was washed with ethanol and filtered. After 24 h drying in a dry box, CH3NH3I powder was obtained. CH3NH3I and PbCl2 were mixed in a molar ratio of 3:1 (CH3NH3I 256 mg, PbCl2 149 mg), and the mixture was dissolved in 1 mL DMF to get pristine CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x precursor solution. PCDTBT powder was dissolved in DMF over 12 h with different concentrations of 0.1–0.5 mg mL−1. After that, the prepared PCDTBT solutions were blended with the mixed powder of CH3NH3I and PbCl2 to get composite CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x:PCDTBT precursor solutions with different doping concentrations. The experimental photos of PCDTBT dissolved in DMF and perovskite precursor solutions are provided in Fig. S1 in the ESI.†
Sample preparation
All the pero-HSCs were fabricated on patterned indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass substrates with a sheet resistance of ∼15 Ω sq−1. ITO glass was cleaned sequentially with neutral detergent, acetone and ethanol in ultrasonic cleaning machines and then subjected to UV-Ozone treatment for 20 min. PEDOT:PSS solution was spin-coated on the as-prepared ITO glass at 4500 rpm for 40 s and then annealed at 140 °C for 20 min. Afterward, in a glovebox filled with nitrogen, the blend solutions of the perovskite precursor with or without PCDTBT were spin-coated on the PEDOT:PSS layer at 4000 rpm for 40 s. The annealing process of the perovskite films was conducted by a typical gradient increased temperature method (the films were slowly heated from 60 to 100 °C at a rate of 10 °C/10 min on a hot plate.).27 And then, PCBM and Bphen were covered over the perovskite layer at 2000 rpm for 40 s successively. After the devices were dried at room temperature for 20 min, a silver electrode with a thickness of 100 nm was thermally evaporated on top of the device under a pressure of 3.0 × 10−4 Torr through a shadow mask with a 0.0725 cm2 active area.
Characterization

J–V characteristics were tested by using a programmable Keithley 2400 source meter under AM 1.5G illumination with a light intensity of 100 mW cm−2 (Newport, Class AAA solar simulator, 94023A-U). Incident-photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) was measured by using a 1000 W halogen lamp and grating monochromator (Acton Spectra Pro 2300i). An ultraviolet photo-electron spectroscopy (UPS) spectrum excited by using an unfiltered He I (21.20 eV) gas discharge lamp was collected by using a SPECS PHOIBOS 100 hemispherical analyzer and the energy resolution was ∼15 meV. X-ray photoemission (XPS) spectral measurement was conducted using a monochromatic Al Kα (1486.61 eV) X-ray source and the same hemispherical analyzer; the energy resolution was ∼0.45 eV. UPS and XPS analyses were carried out at room temperature in the same super high vacuum system (the background vacuum is 5 × 10−10 mbar). The grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) measurement was performed at the BL14B1 beamline of Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF). The two dimensional GIXRD (2D-GIXRD) patterns were obtained by using a MarCCD 225 detector mounted vertically at a distance of around 256.401 mm from the sample with an exposure time of 100 s at a grazing incidence angle of 0.2°. The coordinates of GIXRD patterns were represented by the diffraction vector with q = 4πsin(θ)/λ, where θ is half of the diffraction angle and λ is the wavelength of the incident X-ray.28,29 The electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed by using an IM6e Electrochemical Workstation (ZAHNER, Germany). The absorption spectra were measured with an UV/vis spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer Lambda 750). The surface and cross-sectional morphologies were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Quanta 200 FEG, FEI Co.). Steady-state photo-luminescence (PL) was obtained by using a Edinburgh Instruments FLS920 fluorescence spectrometer with a 532 nm pulsed laser as the excitation source. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were measured using PANalytica 80 equipment (Empyrean, Cu Kα radiation with a wavelength of 0.154 nm). The stability of the devices was evaluated after exposure to ambient air without any wrap. The consistency of each test condition is ensured in the test process.
Results and discussion
The photoelectric and physical properties of pero-HSCs are described in Fig. 2 and Table 1. Fig. 2(a) shows the representative J–V curves of the cells from all sample groups characterized by the maximum PCE. The obtained results indicate that the VOC, JSC and FF cell performance characteristics were remarkably improved after PCDTBT addition. The J–V curves recorded for the top cell (PCE 15.76%) in the dark and light environments indicate that the optimal cell parameters are achieved when the dopant concentration is 0.3 mg mL−1, which is shown in Fig. 2(b). As compared to the reference device with a PCE of 13.19% listed in Table 1, the maximum PCE of 15.76% represents a remarkable improvement by 16%. In order to exclude invalid data points, the relative statistical parameters (including the mean values and standard deviations of JSC and PCE) are also listed in Table 1. The obtained results show that doping PCDTBT can effectively enhance the PCE of pero-HSCs. In addition, Fig. 2(c) shows the intuitive value plot of measured average PCE versus the doping concentration of PCDTBT (statistical parameters such as VOC, JSC and FF obtained for the devices with different doping concentrations are listed in Fig. S2 (ESI†)). It was found that low doping concentrations (0.1 and 0.2 mg mL−1) increased the magnitude of VOC sharply, however, with larger concentrations, the curve became flat. The value of JSC apparently increased after doping; however, it did not significantly depend on the doping concentration. In contrast, the dependence of the performance parameter FF on the doping concentration is characterized by relatively smooth parabolic, small standard deviations indicating better repeatability of the obtained data and greater device stability. The distribution histograms of PCE measured around 20 devices with and without PCDTBT (Fig. 2(d)) indicate an improvement of their photoelectric properties, which most likely originated from the donor/acceptor domain formed by PCDTBT and CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x in the composite film. Because the doping concentration of 0.3 mg mL−1 results in the best device performance in terms of its FF and PCE characteristics, the following measurements have been conducted at this particular PCDTBT concentration.

Fig. 2(e) shows the UV-vis absorption spectra recorded for the doped and undoped films. Typically, PCDTBT doping enhances the light absorption of the perovskite films in the region between 300 nm and 750 nm, owing to the strong absorption of the PCDTBT monomer in this range20,30 (the corresponding spectra obtained for the remaining films with different doping concentrations are shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†)). Fig. 2(f) shows the results of IPCE obtained for the devices with and without PCDTBT. The stronger light response after PCDTBT addition suggests that the carrier migration and collection processes become more effective, which is in good agreement with the results of previous studies, where PCDTBT was used as a donor in a polymer solar cell.21 After integrating the IPCE curves, the obtained values of JSC are 20.25 mA cm−2 and 22.28 mA cm−2, respectively, which were consistent with the statistical results presented in Fig. S2(b).† In order to understand the physical mechanism of the improvement in photoelectric properties after doping PCDTBT, additional characterization of the produced samples had to be conducted.
Since the steady-state PL properties allow the evaluation of film defects and the related carrier recombination probability, PL spectra were recorded for the CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x, CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x:PCDTBT, CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x/PCBM, and CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x:PCDTBT/PCBM films (see Fig. 3(a)). The PL intensity measured for the CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x:PCDTBT system was significantly weaker than that obtained for CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x, suggesting more efficient quenching of PL in the CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x:PCDTBT composite film. The HOMO of PCDTBT is −5.45 eV,19 which provides a good HOMO gradient between PEDOT:PSS (−5.0 eV) and CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x, which can extract the holes efficiently from the perovskite layer to the anode through PEDOT:PSS. More efficient hole extraction can suppress charge recombination and quench the PL of the perovskite film more efficiently in the presence of PCDTBT.31,32 Because PCBM is an effective electron acceptor, the top layer covered over the perovskite film can sufficiently extract excited electrons, yielding a lower PL intensity. For the CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x:PCDTBT/PCBM film, the difference caused by the doping of PCDTBT can also be observed. Therefore, doping PCDTBT results in higher carrier extraction efficiency and fewer carrier recombinations, and ultimately improves the cell photoelectric performance.

Small series resistance consisting of sheet and charge transfer resistances can be advantageous for manufacturing a high-quality device. The EIS technique can be used to estimate the resistance of solar cells by analyzing the frequency-dependent alternating current response (which can be obtained from the corresponding Nyquist plot at high frequencies,33 a model containing one equivalent resistor–capacitor (RC) circuit is normally used for fitting purposes). Fig. 3(b) shows the fitted EIS data obtained for the devices with and without PCDTBT, where RSH and RCT represent the sheet resistance and charge transfer resistance inside the produced perovskite films, respectively (the related Nyquist plots were recorded in the dark at an alternating current amplitude of 10 mV and deflection voltage of 0.9 V; parameters are summarized in Table S1 (ESI†)). A typical value of RCT for the PCDTBT-doped device was 447.23 Ω cm2, while for the reference device this magnitude is 935.25 Ω cm2. Combining the general relation of carrier mobility and the junction conductivity (σ = nqμn + pqμp), we can estimate that a lower carrier transfer resistance can lead to higher carrier transfer efficiency. The observed decrease in RCT is related to the fewer number of trap states on the uniform composite film surface caused by the passivation effect described above. On the other hand, the difference in the sheet resistance RSH between these devices was very small, indicating that the utilized film manufacturing process was relatively stable for different devices. Hence, the analyses of the IPCE, light absorption, PL and EIS parameters (which are characterized by the strong light response, passivation effect, decreased number of defects, and small transfer resistance) are consistent with the increases in JSC and FF observed after PCDTBT addition.
Matching energy levels for each layer is important for producing pero-HSCs with outstanding properties. Therefore, UPS analysis was conducted to verify the energy levels of different films. Fig. 3(c) shows the UPS spectra recorded for the doped and the undoped films, while the inset describes the amplification region for the electronic cut-off edge. The HOMO value obtained from UPS for the doped film was −5.77 eV, while for the undoped film it was −5.88 eV (the change of the energy level of HOMO after PCDTBT doping is 0.11 eV). It can be found from the UV absorption edge (Fig. S3†) that the bandgaps of both doped and undoped films are 1.57 eV, which indicates that there is no change in the bandgap by trace amount doping. Thus, the LUMOs are −4.2 eV (CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x:PCDTBT) and −4.31 eV (CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x) respectively, which match well with the electron transport layer PCBM (−4.2 eV) for electron transport at the interfaces after doping. Thus, holes can easily transport to the anode through PEDOT:PSS in the case of the presence of PCDTBT. More efficient hole extraction can suppress recombination at the interfaces.31
In order to confirm the passivation effect, XPS spectra characterizing various surface chemical states have been recorded for different films. Fig. 3(d) displays the binding energies corresponding to Pb valence electrons (the background correction was performed using the Shirley algorithm). After fitting the obtained data with the Lorentzian–Gaussian double distribution function, two Pb 4f peaks (4f7/2 and 4f5/2) are obtained. As compared with the spectra recorded for the pristine film, the binding energies of the composite film exhibited a shift toward lower values, indicating that some molecular interactions between PCDTBT and CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x have occurred. Generally, the binding energy of an element decreases after acquiring electrons. According to the obtained XPS spectrum, Pb atoms tend to “donor” systems after PCDTBT doping;34 in particular, the lone electron pairs of S and N atoms of PCDTBT molecules were successfully delocalized via the interactions with under-coordinated Pb ions.24 The schematic picture shown in Fig. 1(a) reveals that the perovskite crystal cells bonded to PCDTBT molecular “ropes” formed a Stonehenge-like structure because of the activity of their lone electron pairs. Combined with the above experimental results, such a structure contains oriented perovskite crystal cells inside a highly ordered light absorption layer which can guarantee a smaller number of defects and lower probability of carrier recombination.
To characterize the crystalline orientation of the light absorption layer, 2D-GIXRD measurements of both the doped and undoped films have been conducted (see Fig. 4(a and b)). Similar diffraction rings with a spot diagram were observed for the obtained 2D-GIXRD, demonstrating that highly aptotic crystal domains were formed in all the studied films.35 The scattered rings at q = 10, 20, 22.2 nm−1 represent the (110), (220) and (310) crystal planes of the tetragonal perovskite structure, respectively. A color comparison revealed that the doped films assumed more preferred orientations than the undoped one, indicating the formation of more ordered crystalline domains.29 The orientation distribution of the (110) crystal plane plotted along the ring of the perovskite crystalline plane at q = 10 nm−1 was transformed by integrating the scattered ring in all directions, as shown in Fig. 4(c) (here the horizontal coordinate represents the azimuth angle φ, and the vertical coordinate represents the radially integrated intensity). The peak at 90° (corresponding to the in-plane direction of the doped film) was sharper and stronger than that for the undoped one. The preferred in-plane orientation of the perovskites, i.e., the less crystalline defects, would elevate the carrier transfer efficiency along the preferred directions and reduce the carrier recombination,36 effectively enhancing JSC. Thus, it can be concluded that weak random perovskite grains gradually assume the preferred orientation after adding PCDTBT. Meanwhile, XRD for different perovskite films was investigated as well (as seen in Fig. 4(d)). The diffraction peaks observed at 14.17°, 28.49° and 43.27° were respectively assigned to the (110), (220) and (330) crystal planes of the tetragonal perovskite phase. According to the obtained pattern, the intensities of the peaks corresponding to the three crystal planes considerably increased after doping PCDTBT, suggesting that the doping promoted the crystallization of the entire film. In addition, no peaks corresponding to crystallized PCDTBT were detected, which confirmed that all the added PCDTBT had successfully reacted (the detailed XRD patterns of different doping concentrations are displayed in Fig. S4†).

The critical parameters for pero-HSCs are the film morphology and crystallization quality of the perovskite absorption layer. Many optical properties, such as light harvesting and carrier transport ones, are significantly affected by the morphology and crystallization of perovskite absorption films.37–39 Hence, the top SEM morphology images of the perovskite absorption layers with different concentrations of PCDTBT are shown in Fig. 5(a–f). While the pristine film exhibited a rod-like surface morphology (Fig. 5(a)), the composite films contained various block shapes (Fig. 5(b–f)). The observed changes in the crystal morphology can be attributed to the moment polarity of PCDTBT (its dipole moment evaluated using the Gaussian40 was equal to 2.445 D, while the orientation of PCDTBT dipoles was perpendicular to that of the molecular core). Because of the relatively large dipole moment of PCDTBT, both the monomer and polymer aggregate when the doping concentration reaches a certain level. We have estimated the average size of the grain by using an Image J.41 The average grain sizes of the different doping concentrations are 0.92 μm2 (ref.), 1.15 μm2 (0.1 mg mL−1), 1.89 μm2 (0.2 mg mL−1), 2.14 μm2 (0.3 mg mL−1), 3.48 μm2 (0.4 mg mL−1), and 6.93 μm2 (0.5 mg mL−1), respectively. Obviously, as the doping concentration increased, the size of the perovskite grain increased as well. The larger grain brings the higher VOC,43–45 because the larger grain can effectively transfer the light energy for exciting electron, and avoid the energy loss in the photovoltaic process. Moreover, the coverage rate of the perovskite film can be calculated using the Adobe Photoshop software29,42 (for pristine films, it is 95.92%, while some other values estimated for the studied composite films, are 96.89% (0.1 mg mL−1), 97.33% (0.2 mg mL−1), 98.54% (0.3 mg mL−1), 96.57% (0.4 mg mL−1), and 94.89% (0.5 mg mL−1), respectively). At excessive PCDTBT doping (0.4 and 0.5 mg mL−1), the sizes of pinholes and cracks on the film surface increase due to the formation of PCDTBT clusters, which deteriorate the film properties and are the primary reasons for the lower FF discussed above (see also in Fig. S2†). Therefore, although there are some pinholes in 0.3 mg mL−1 PCDTBT based films, there maybe a balance of less pinholes and a larger grain size, which causes the higher VOC. Therefore, according to our statistical results shown in Fig. S2,† although pinhole films may bring negative influence on VOC, the larger crystalline grain still makes the cells have a higher VOC.43–45

In addition, long-term stability measurements were performed for the fabricated devices (the tested samples were kept at a temperature of 28 °C and the relative humidity of 30%). As shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†), the PCE values of the devices manufactured from CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x:PCDTBT decreased only by 19% after 192 h of storage. In contrast, the observed decrease in PCE for the reference devices was as high as 30%, indicating faster degradation. The magnitudes of VOC, JSC and FF measured for the same cells exhibited a similar trend. The observed high stability of the doped cells can be attributed to the outstanding stability of PCDTBT in air, which was exhibited in organic polymer solar cells.22 Another important characteristic of the enhanced stability, a small hysteresis of the J–V dependence observed for the devices with and without a dopant is shown in Fig. S5.† A plausible explanation of this phenomenon is that PCDTBT doping reduces the number of film defects and trap states, since defects and trap states are the main causes of the hysteresis effect.46,47 The detailed parameters of the different scanning directions are presented in Table S2 (ESI†).
Conclusions
Doping PCDTBT has increased the PCE of the fabricated solar cell devices up to 15.76% (the resulting Stonehenge-type eutectic structure consisted of perovskite and PCDTBT molecules). The added PCDTBT donates lone pair electrons of their S and N atoms to under-coordinated Pb ions, thus passivating positive ion trap states in the bulk active layer. The passivation effect in turn decreases the probability of carrier recombination and efficiently promotes the charge transfer and collection processes. In addition, the presence of PCDTBT enhances the stability of pero-HSCs in an air environment. The described optimized method can pave the way to fabricating efficient and stable planar perovskite solar cells.
