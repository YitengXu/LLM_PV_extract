    , Accepted 1st November 2019First published on 4th November 2019AbstractHydrogen production by water electrolysis is a common strategy for the development of renewable energy. However, meeting the industrial requirement for high efficiency and low cost is difficult to achieve with the existing methods. Herein, a novel and simple synthesis route for a dendritic self-supported electrode consisting of oxygen vacancy-rich NiO embedded within ultrathin 2D/3D nanostructures (NiO-Vo@2D/3D NS@DSE) for overall water splitting is developed for the first time. Based on the simple compound synthesis by jet electrodeposition and in situ acid etching, 2D nanosheets adhering uniformly to 3D nanospheres are successfully obtained on the dendritic self-supported skeleton surface. The experiments and density functional calculations illustrate that this electrode integrates the advantages including numerous active sites, intrinsic catalytic activity, good electrical conductivity, and outstanding reaction kinetic performance. Moreover, NiO-Vo@2D/3D NS@DSE shows excellent oxygen evolution reaction and hydrogen evolution reaction activities in 1 M KOH with overpotentials of 230 and 51 mV at 10 mA cm−2, respectively. Additionally, the electrode, as an alkali-electrolyzer, displays a potential of 1.51 V at 10 mA cm−2 with favorable stability that is superior to that of IrO2@nickel foam (NF)//Pt/C@NF (1.62 V). Surprisingly, the cost of NiO-Vo@2D/3D NS@DSE is ≈1/120 of the price of noble electrocatalysts with the same mass. This research opens up a new pathway for the design of bifunctional electrocatalysts.
Hydrogen energy is a clean renewable energy. Nowadays, water electrolysis for hydrogen production, which is driven by the ‘waste electricity’ from solar power and wind to realize energy conversion, is considered a research hotspot.1,2 The process of water splitting is coupled with two half reactions: the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER).3 However, the sluggish reaction kinetics of the OER and HER have severely blocked the efficient performance of hydrogen production.4,5 Therefore, a high-efficiency electrocatalyst is essential to lower the energy barrier and improve the reaction rate for water splitting.6,7 At present, Pt and IrO2, as state-of-the-art electrocatalysts for the HER and OER, respectively, feature high cost and shortage, thus seriously inhibiting a wide range of applications.8 Hence, a high-efficiency and low-cost bifunctional electrocatalyst for water electrolysis should be explored.
Recently, a self-supported electrode that can effectively increase the active sites, reduce the reaction impedance, and improve the mass transfer between the solution and electrode was developed to replace the electrocatalysts with a Nafion polymer as the binder to improve the electrocatalytic activity.9–12 The electrode decorated with 2D nanosheets can considerably increase the surface area, but ultrathin 2D nanosheets would be prone to collapse during rigorous reaction processes, thus blocking the active area and impeding the electrocatalytic performance.13 Accordingly, the 2D/3D coupling structure is proposed. For instance, Wu et al. reported the synthesis of ultrathin Co-layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanosheets on carbon paper (CP) and then the 3D zif-67 dodecahedron was grafted on the 2D nanosheets, achieving the coupling structure after pyrolysis. The electrocatalytic activity showed overpotentials of 66 mV and 248 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 for the HER and OER, respectively.13 Wehrspohn et al. introduced 3D hierarchical heterostructure ultrathin NiFe LDH nanosheet@NiCoP nanowires by hydrothermal and phosphorization reactions; the water electrolyzer with 1.57 V was used to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm−2.14 Shen et al. adopted a reflux and hydrothermal method to prepare a 3D hierarchical nanoarchitecture, consisting of ultrathin Ni–Fe LDH nanosheets or porous Ni–Fe oxides (NiFeOx) assembled on a metallic NiCu alloy nanosphere and yielded a current density of 10 mA cm−2 at the overpotentials of 66 mV and 218 mV for the HER and OER, respectively.15 However, the above studies still featured high-cost and time-consumption owing to the substrates (NF and CP, etc.), precursor materials (metal–organic frameworks), and preparation methods (hydrothermal method, chemical vapor deposition, and reflux). Therefore, constructing an integrated 2D/3D self-supported electrode by a simple and cost-effective method presents a challenge.
Among low-cost alternatives, such as transition metal oxides,16–19 hydroxides,20–22 sulfides,23–26 phosphides27–32 and nitrides,33,34 nickel-based (hydr)oxides35 were the desired electrocatalysts for the OER because of their intrinsic performance for the OER and earth-abundant materials. Nevertheless, the inherently poor electronic conductivity and inappropriate hydrogen absorption energies of nickel-based (hydr)oxides hinder their electrocatalytic activity as efficient bifunctional catalysts.36 Vacancy defects have been introduced into the lattice of nickel-based (hydr)oxides, which can enhance the electrical conductivity and increase the number of porous structures, to solve this problem, thus reducing the overpotential for electrocatalytic reaction and improving the intrinsic performance.37 Qiao et al. prepared self-supported NiO nanorods by oxygen vacancy engineering via a facile cation exchange strategy, which promoted the HER activity as verified by density functional theory (DFT).38 Xie et al. fabricated NiCo2O4 nanosheets by the hydrothermal method with oxygen vacancies as an efficient OER electrocatalyst.39 Sun and co-workers adopted the flame-engraved method to induce abundant oxygen vacancies and well-defined cavities into NiFe LDHs, promoting the exposure of active sites and resulting in a lower energy barrier compared to that without oxygen vacancies for the OER reaction steps.40 However, from the most-recently and above-mentioned reports, most strategies for creating vacancies, hydrothermal process, heating reduction, plasma etching and flame engraving method, are rigorous and feature high cost under synthesis conditions. Therefore, a high-efficiency, low-cost, and large-scale synthesis method or rich-vacancy bifunctional electrocatalysts must be explored.
Herein, we fabricate for the first time a multi-row dendritic self-supported skeleton (DSS) by the jet electrodeposition method at a local high current density. Benefiting from its unique open porous structure, the DSS can expedite electrolyte penetration and accelerate mass transfer. Moreover, the novel dendritic self-supported electrode consisting of rich-vacancy NiO embedded within ultrathin 2D and 3D nanospheres (NiO-Vo@2D/3D NS@DSE) is obtained by etching the DSS in HCl solution. The 2D/3D NiO nanostructure considerably increases the electrode surface area and offers abundant catalytically active sites. Meanwhile, the rich-vacancy NiO improves the electrical conductivity and optimizes the reaction energy barrier for the OER and HER. As expected, NiO-Vo@2D/3D NS@DSE exhibits excellent OER and HER electrocatalytic performance with the overpotentials of 230 mV and 51 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm−2, respectively. Furthermore, NiO-Vo@2D/3D NS@DSE as an alkaline electrolyzer delivers a current density of 10 mA cm−2 at a low cell voltage of 1.51 V, preceding that of noble electrocatalysts (Pt/C@NF||IrO2@NF) and other Ni-based electrocatalysts. The cost of NiO-Vo@2D/3D NS@DSE is ≈1/120 of IrO2 and Pt/C electrocatalysts with the same mass. Combined with the DFT calculations, NiO decorated with oxygen vacancies optimizes the adsorption energy of intermediates, facilitating the OER and HER activities. Hence, NiO-Vo@2D/3D NS@DSE introduces a new idea for the preparation of low-cost and high-efficiency electrodes and rational utilization of hydrogen energy.

Fig. 1 illustrates the fabrication process of NiO-Vo@2D/3D NS@DSE (the specific experimental details are shown in the ESI†). The DSS as the substrate electrode is first fabricated with jet electrodeposition at local high current density on the titanium (Ti) plate as the cathode, coupled with a 6 mm Ti rod as the anode perpendicular to the cathode. The solution for jet electrodeposition consists of 300 g l−1 NiSO4·6H2O, 40 g l−1 NiCl2·6H2O, and 40 g l−1 H3BO3. Given the template of the rod anode, the cylindric DSS is obtained, and its height reaches 2 cm in 30 min. Benefitting from the favorable pliability, the DSS can be relaxed to a clip and spread as a plate-type electrode. Afterward, the plate-type DSS is immersed in 2 M HCl solution for 20 min at 90 °C to allow for the in situ etching and oxidation, giving rise to the formation of 2D NiO nanosheets adhering to 3D nanospheres. The skeleton is removed and flushed repeatedly with large amounts of water and ethanol, respectively. Then, the skeleton is dried at 60 °C for 24 h. Then NiO-Vo@2D/3D NS@DSE is easily obtained by the synthesis method involving jet electrodeposition and one-step etching in HCl solution. To date, the self-supported electrodes, such as NF (≈$2.33 for 1 g)41 and CP (≈$5.46 for 1 g),42 are applied widely. However, 1 g NiO-Vo@2D/3D NS@DSE costs ≈$0.8, which is about 1/3 and 1/7 of NF and CP, respectively. Moreover, the cost of NiO-Vo@2D/3D NS@DSE is ≈1/120 of IrO2 and Pt/C (≈$95 for 1 g) electrocatalysts with the same mass. Therefore, this compound method, which comprises jet electrodeposition at local high current density and in situ acid etching, is a low-cost and time-efficient synthesis route for self-supported electrodes.
 Fig. 1  Schematic for the DSS and in situ growth of 2D/3D NiO nanospheres on the DSS surface. 
Fig. S2a and S2b† show the macro- and micro-morphologies of the DSS, respectively. From the SEM images, the DSS possesses multi-row dendrites, consisting of numerous large spheres, which aggregate along the same direction; this structure differs from the open porous structure of NF (Fig. S3a and S3b†). Meanwhile, the surface of each large sphere is distributed with tiny particles. Furthermore, the local magnification image (Fig. S2c†) shows that the microscopic surface of each macrosphere is smooth but accompanied by several irregular round defects. The HRTEM image (Fig. S2d†) is obtained by fully grinding the DSS. The surface of the DSS displays a layered structure with 10 nm thickness, and lattice spacings of 0.208 nm, consistent with the (200) plane of NiO. Meanwhile, the adequate amounts of amorphous structure exist in the layer of NiO. After etching with 2 M HCl solution for 20 min, the macro-morphology maintains the array structure of dendrites as shown in Fig. 2a. Nevertheless, the surface becomes coarse and fluffy (Fig. 2b), assembling with numerous spherical particles (Fig. 2b inset). The magnified image (Fig. 2c) further shows that the uniform 3D nanospheres with a diameter of 300 nm are covered with numerous 2D nanosheets.

(g) Atomic force microscopy (AFM) image of NiO nanosheets. (h–j) Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) mapping of 2D/3D NiO nanospheres. 
To further explore the influence of the morphology of NiO-Vo@2D/3D NS@DSE on controlling the acid etching parameters, we select the different HCl solution temperatures (30, 50, 70, and 90 °C) and concentrations (0.5, 1, 2, and 3 M). As shown in Fig. S4,† the surface of the DSS gradually coarsens with the increase of temperature in 2 M HCl solution. Meanwhile, the nanosphere structure appears on the surface of DSS beyond 70 °C. When changing the concentration of the HCl solution (Fig. S5†), the surface morphologies become rougher with many nanosheets. However, as the HCl concentration increases to 3 M, the surface is etched excessively, leaving a portion of the 2D/3D nanostructure. In order to investigate the detailed morphology of 3D nanospheres, Fig. 2d shows the TEM image of multiple nanospheres, consistent with the magnified SEM images. The edge of the 3D nanospheres is continually observed, with the micro-structural characteristics depicted in the HRTEM image (Fig. 2e). Ultrafine nanoparticles are embedded within the ultrathin 2D nanosheets. The particle size is distributed at 2–5 nm, with an average diameter of about 3.5 nm (Fig. 2e inset). As shown in Fig. 2f, the lattice fringe emerging in the 2D nanosheets as the skeleton measures 0.202 nm, showing to be in good agreement with the (111) lattice plane of NiO. The part in blue circles reveals the lattice fringe of 0.208 nm, which corresponds to the (200) plane of NiO. However, the other part in yellow circles is consistent with the amorphous structure, similar to the surface structure of DSS. The SAED pattern (Fig. 2f inset) further confirms the (200) plane of NiO and amorphous organization, which are indicated by the red dot-line and dim portions, respectively. From recent research, an amorphous organization can offer a large number of defects as active sites to achieve reaction efficiency.43–45 The thickness of 2D nanosheets measured by AFM is approximately 4 nm (Fig. 2g). In the EDS, elemental mapping (Fig. 2h–j) for the analysis of element contents show that Ni and O coexist, which are homogeneous within the surface of NiO-Vo@2D/3D NS@DSE, consistent with the distribution of DSS. Furthermore, the mass fraction of O increases from 8.42% to 11.33% after the etching process (Fig. S6 and S7†). Therefore, an abundant NiO structure appears on the surface electrode by jet electrodeposition and etching with HCl solution.
The XRD patterns of DSS and NiO-Vo@2D/3D NS@DSE are obtained to further investigate the structural phase characterization (Fig. 3a), from which only the Ni phase is identified at 2θ of 44.6°, 51.9°, and 76.5°, corresponding to the lattice planes of (111), (200), and (220) as Ni(PDF#70-0989) without other peaks, respectively. Meanwhile, the DSS and NiO-Vo@2D/3D NS@DSE feature almost identical peaks in the XRD pattern, revealing that NiO-Vo@2D/3D NS@DSE retains the same phase structure as DSS. Meanwhile, this result may illustrate that NiO-Vo@2D/3D NS@DSE contains a large amount of amorphous structure, coinciding with the HRTEM images and SAED pattern.

XPS is conducted to analyze the surface composition and valence states of elements. From the XPS survey spectra (Fig. S8†), the surface elements include Ni and O, in addition to the C 1s signal located at 284.6 eV as the corrected signal. This finding suggests that the DSS and NiO-Vo@2D/3D NS@DSE contain no other impurities and correspond to the EDS results. For Ni 2p3/2 peaks of DSS (Fig. 3b), the peaks at the binding energies of 852.6 eV and 856 eV with 859.3 eV as the satellite peak confirm that the DSS not only contains metal Ni but also Ni2+ as NiO, corresponding to the lattice fringes in the HRTEM images.46 However, the intensity of the peak at 852 eV assigned to metal Ni is reduced after etching on the surface of NiO-Vo@2D/3D NS@DSE. Meanwhile, the higher intensity peaks located at 855.8 eV with 860 eV as the satellite peak suggest that the amount of NiO structure has been further increased. Compared with the Ni 2p3/2 binding energy of the DSS, the peak assigned to Ni2+ forming NiO-Vo@2D/3D NS@DSE shifts by 0.8 eV to the low binding energy, indicating that the structure of NiO may be accompanied by lattice defects. Fig. 3c shows the high-resolution O 1s spectrum of the DSS and NiO-Vo@2D/3D NS@DSE. The characteristic peaks at 530.8 eV, 513.9 eV, and 532.9 eV from the DSS are attributed to M–O, oxygen vacancies and adsorbent H–OH, which confirm that the oxygen vacancies already exist on the surface of the DSS.47,48 After etching in HCl solution, the O 1s peak area of NiO-Vo@2D/3D NS@DSE located at 513.4 eV corresponding to oxygen vacancies is further increased, indicating that more oxygen vacancies are generated within the 2D/3D NiO nanospheres. The peak of the O 1s spectrum, corresponding to the oxygen vacancies, shifts negatively compared with that of the DSS. This phenomenon is mainly attributed to the stronger electronic interaction caused by the increasing oxygen vacancies.49 The nickel atoms surrounding the oxygen vacancies could obtain more electrons, further affecting the charge distribution of oxygen atoms. Therefore, lower binding energy shifts are exhibited for Ni and O elements, which may facilitate the electrocatalytic performance. EPR measurement is used to further verify the existence of oxygen vacancies, as shown in Fig. 3d. The strongest intensity signal at g = 2.005 illustrates the higher oxygen-vacancy density on the 2D/3D NiO nanospheres compared with that of DSS and NF, showing good agreement with the XPS analysis.50
The XAFS at the Ni K-edge is applied to reveal the coordination environment of metal cations and element valence state to further explore the defect structure in the DSS. Fig. 3e shows that the Ni K-edge XANES spectra for the DSS locates between Ni foil and NiO spectra, suggesting that the DSS contains part of the nickel oxide, which is consistent with the Ni 2p3/2 spectra. Afterward, the Ni K-edge R-space spectra (Fig. 3e inset) provide detailed information about the coordination environment of the DSS. The intensity peak assigned to the Ni–Ni shell is lower than that of Ni foil, indicating that the DSS possesses a more distorted structure. Based on the above analysis, we can conclude that many defects in the DSS are generated by the jet electrodeposition method, which involves a quick nucleation process. The 2D/3D NiO nanospheres with more abundant defects are formed on the surface of the DSS, which is under intense etching and high-temperature (90 °C) oxidation process.
The nickel foil as the control group is etched under the same condition as NiO-Vo@2D/3D NS@DSE to further explain the mechanism of oxygen vacancy formation. Fig. S9a and S9b† show the observed surface morphologies. The rough layer with tiny particles is only observed on the surface without other nanostructures, which is compared with the fresh nickel foil, agreeing with previously reported results.51–53 Using the EPR spectrum to confirm the oxygen vacancy, the result indicates no evident existence of oxygen vacancy on the surface of nickel foil (Fig. S9c†). Combining with the above results, we could deduce that the mechanism of oxygen vacancy formation is caused by the lattice distortion and defect in the DSS. The nickel vacancies and distortion exposed on the outer surface might be oxidized in hot HCl solution, leading to the NiO nanostructure with more oxygen vacancies (Fig. S9d†).53 Therefore, the unique structure and characterization of NiO-Vo@2D/3D NS@DSE are mainly attributed to the defects from the DSS obtained by the novel compound approach of jet electrodeposition and in situ acid etching.
As shown in Fig. 3f, the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area of NiO-Vo@2D/3D NS@DSE, measured by N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms, is 3.66 m2 g−1, which is larger than that of DSS (1.78 m2 g−1) (Fig. S10†) and NF (1.2 m2 g−1).52 The pore size from the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda model demonstrates the sizes of mesopores in NiO-Vo@2D/3D NS@DSE (Fig. 3f inset). The high content of mesoporous structure can offer a larger number of active sites and accelerate the mass transport to further enhance the electrocatalytic performance.
Benefitting from the unique macro and microstructure, we first explore the electrocatalytic activity of NiO-Vo@2D/3D NS@DSE compared with DSS and NF for the OER in O2-saturated 1 M KOH solution by employing a three-electrode cell. The measurements of HCl concentration and solution temperature are used to reveal the suitable optimal parameters for electrocatalytic performance to explore the influence rule of acid etching under different parameters. As shown in Fig. S11,† we select the 2 M and 90 °C HCl solution as optimal experimental parameters. Fig. 4a shows the polarization curves of the electrodes. NiO-Vo@2D/3D NS@DSE exhibits a more excellent OER activity than IrO2@NF as a benchmark OER electrocatalyst. Meanwhile, Fig. 4b comparatively displays the overpotentials of the electrode at a current density of 100 mA cm−2. NiO-Vo@2D/3D NS@DSE needs the lowest overpotential of 330 mV, which is more superior to that of IrO2@NF (390 mV). In contrast, the DSS and NF require overpotentials of 420 mV and 599 mV to obtain a current density of 100 mA cm−2, respectively. The overpotential of NiO-Vo@2D/3D NS@DSE for 10 mA cm−2 (as acquired from chronopotentiometry) is still smaller than that of the other reported noble-metal-free catalysts shown in Table S3,† which proves the outstanding OER performance of NiO-Vo@2D/3D NS@DSE. Moreover, NiO-Vo@2D/3D NS@DSE shows the Tafel slope of 68 mV dec−1, which is smaller than that of DSS (89 mV dec−1), IrO2@NF (83 mV dec−1) and NF (216 mV dec−1), respectively, suggesting that NiO-Vo@2D/3D NS@DSE delivers the fastest OER kinetics (Fig. 4c).

C
dl is measured to estimate the electrocatalytic active surface areas (ECSA) to reveal the intrinsic quality of NiO-Vo@2D/3D NS@DSE. CV is adopted with different scan rates from 50 mV s−1 to 250 mV s−1 (Fig. S12†). The Cdl of NiO-Vo@2D/3D NS@DSE is 6.17 mF cm−2, which is larger than that of the DSS (3.41 mF cm−2) and NF (1.06 mF cm−2) (Fig. 4d). Thus, NiO-Vo@2D/3D NS@DSE features the highest ECSA among the electrodes, showing good agreement of the result with the BET surface area. This result is mainly attributed to the 2D nanosheets adhering on the 3D nanospheres, which are loaded on the open self-supported electrode. As a result, the area of NiO-Vo@2D/3D NS@DSE is notably increased when exposed to more active sites. The OER activity normalized by ESCA for NiO-Vo@2D/3D NS@DSE (Fig. S13†) is superior to that of DSS and NF, indicating that NiO-Vo@2D/3D NS@DSE possesses a better electrocatalytic effect. This result suggests that NiO-Vo@2D/3D NS@DSE not only contains a high surface area but also exhibits an excellent intrinsic activity owing to the high amount of oxygen vacancies.54–56 To further verify the intrinsic activity of NiO-Vo@2D/3D NS@DSE, we calculate the turnover frequencies (TOF) of the electrodes by the number of active sites according to the integrated CV curve (Fig. S14a†). The TOF of NiO-Vo@2D/3D NS@DSE is 1.14 s−1 at the overpotential of 350 mV, which is about ten times as high as that of DSS (0.1 s−1) (Fig. S14b†). Therefore, the intrinsic activity of NiO-Vo@2D/3D NS@DSE is improved by the increased number of NiO with oxygen vacancies.
EIS is performed to further understand the activity of NiO-Vo@2D/3D NS@DSE (Fig. 4e). The Nyquist plot of NiO-Vo@2D/3D NS@DSE illustrates a smaller charge transfer resistance (Rs) at the overpotential of 300 mV compared with that of DSS and NF, indicating the high conductivity and fast charge transfer at the interface of liquid/electrode owing to the metallic Ni core and oxygen vacancies permeating into NiO.
The chronoamperometric measurements are carried out to explain the stability of NiO-Vo@2D/3D NS@DSE. A long-term OER measurement at 100 mA cm−2 is conducted for 24 h (Fig. 4f). The potential curve maintains the overpotential of 330 mV without wide damping and fluctuation, which suggests that NiO-Vo@2D/3D NS@DSE possesses a high electrocatalytic performance and good stability toward the OER. Fig. S15† shows the chronoamperometric measurement at a low density of 10 mA cm−2. The polarization curve after 5000 CV cycles (Fig. 4f inset) shows a negligible change in NiO-Vo@2D/3D NS@DSE, further indicating the remarkable durability of the studied material. Fig. S16† illustrates the 5000 cycle CV curves. The curves show negligible changes, implying an outstanding activity. As shown in Table S2,† the release of nickel to the solution after continuous CV measurements is notably small, which confirms the robust and strong nanostructure of NiO-Vo@2D/3D NS@DSE.
The SEM and TEM images (Fig. S17a and S17b†) reveal that a certain amount of nanospheres still adhere to the surface of skeleton and manifest slight aggregation, indicating the reliable structural stability of NiO-Vo@2D/3D NS@DSE. The surface oxidation states of elements after 24 h of OER chronoamperometric measurement are tested by XPS (Fig. S18†). The peak area located at 530.5 eV corresponding to the M–O bond increases, whereas the oxygen vacancies assigned at 531.3 eV are still the main components. In general, after the OER chronoamperometric measurement, the sample would contain a hydroxyl group on the surface. Thus, the Fourier transform infrared spectrum is adopted to reveal the hydroxyl group. As shown in Fig. S19a,† the small peak at 3501.25 cm−1 is assigned to hydrogen-bonded hydroxyl groups, suggesting that a small amount of hydroxyl group is absorbed on the surface. Meanwhile, the EPR spectrum (Fig. S19b†) is obtained to further verify the existence of oxygen vacancies. The results confirm that NiO-Vo@2D/3D NS@DSE exhibits a remarkable catalysis and structural stability. The Faraday efficiency (Fig. S20†), which is measured by the drainage method at the current density of 50 mA cm−2, is approximately 100%, indicating that another reaction has not occurred in the OER.
The HER electrocatalytic performance is further investigated in N2-saturated 1 M KOH solution within the three-electrode cell. Similarly, the optimal HER activity is still gained in 2 M HCl solution at 90 °C to better demonstrate the superior HER performance of NiO-Vo@2D/3D NS@DSE influenced by different parameters (Fig. S21†). The polarization curve reveals that the onset overpotential for NiO-Vo@2D/3D NS@DSE is surprisingly lower than that of the state-of-the-art Pt/C@NF electrode (Fig. 5a). Meanwhile, the overpotentials for delivering a current density of 10 mA cm−2 (Fig. 5b) are 51, 135, 198, and 57 mV for NiO-Vo@2D/3D NS@DSE, DSS, NF, and Pt/C@NF electrodes, respectively. NiO-Vo@2D/3D NS@DSE could demonstrate an excellent HER activity that is superior to that of DSS, NF, and most non-noble-metal Ni-based electrocatalysts (Table S4†). Fig. 5c shows that NiO-Vo@2D/3D NS@DSE displays the smallest Tafel slope of 62 mV dec−1, which is lower than that of DSS (125 mV dec−1) and NF (134 mV dec−1) and even similar to that of Pt/C@NF (46 mV dec−1), indicating that NiO-Vo@2D/3D NS@DSE features a more rapid HER kinetics. Furthermore, the TOF value of NiO-Vo@2D/3D NS@DSE at the overpotential of −300 mV for the HER is 6.72 s−1 (Fig. S22†), which is 6.3 times higher than that of DSS, illustrating that 2D/3D NiO with rich oxygen vacancies after acid etching exhibits a high-efficiency intrinsic activity for the HER.

(d) Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) spectra. (e) Long-time durability tests at the current density of −10 mA cm−2. (f) Polarization curves of the HER before and after 5000 CV cycles. 
EIS is adapted to understand the influence rule of electrodes to further assess the electrochemical characteristics. Fig. 5d shows that NiO-Vo@2D/3D NS@DSE has the smallest radius corresponding to the lowest charge transfer resistance, suggesting high conductivity and fast charge transfer. Additionally, the HER polarization curves normalized to the ESCA (Fig. S23†) exhibit the more excellent HER activity of NiO-Vo@2D/3D NS@DSE compared to that of DSS, further revealing the intrinsic optimization for high-efficiency HER activity owing to a certain amount of oxygen vacancies as the active sites.
Furthermore, the HER stability of NiO-Vo@2D/3D NS@DSE is evaluated by chronopotentiometry at −10 mA cm−2 for 24 h. From Fig. 5e, the potential at the overpotential of 51 mV is maintained as a line with only slight fluctuation owing to H2 bubble release. After 5000 CV cycles (the CV curves for 5000 cycles of CV measurement are shown in Fig. S24,† and the released elements in the solution are shown in Table S2†), the polarization curve presents a negligible decay compared with the HER curve before the CV cycles, confirming the remarkable HER durability. SEM, TEM and XPS measurements are used to gain insights into the durability of NiO-Vo@2D/3D NS@DSE for the HER. Fig. S25† shows the morphology of NiO-Vo@2D/3D NS@DSE, which exhibits an ignorable change, and is still covered by numerous nanospheres after long-term HER. As shown in Fig. S26a,† the peak at 852.0 eV as Ni0 disappears from the Ni 2p3/2 spectra peak. Furthermore, the O 1s spectra (Fig. S26b†) indicate that the M–O content decreases after the HER stability process, but, the peak area of oxygen vacancies accounts for the highest part, indicating the prominent stability of oxygen vacancies within the NiO nanosheets, similar to the results of the EPR spectrum (Fig. S27†). The Faraday efficiency calculated at the current density of −50 mA cm−2 is approximately 97% (Fig. S28†), indicating that a minimal reduction occurs in the HER process corresponding to the XPS results.
Benefitting from the superior OER and HER electrocatalytic performances, we use NiO-Vo@2D/3D NS@DSE as the anode and cathode for overall water splitting in 1 M KOH within a two-electrode electrolyzer. Fig. 6a exhibits that NiO-Vo@2D/3D NS@DSE requires the potential of 1.51 V, which is notably lower than that of the commercial Pt/C@NF//IrO2@NF (1.62 V), to drive the current density of 10 mA cm−2. The fine bubbles uniformly overflow from the electrode surface (Fig. 6a inset and Movie S1†). The excellent electrocatalytic activity is also remarkably optimal compared with other Ni-based electrocatalysts (Table S5†). The long-term stability for overall water splitting is assessed by chronopotentiometry at the current density of 10 mA cm−2 for 24 h. Fig. 6b shows the steady potential, suggesting the excellent overall water splitting durability. The above results illustrate NiO-Vo@2D/3D durability.

The above results illustrate that NiO-Vo@2D/3D NS@DSE is a promising and efficient alternative electrocatalyst for replacing the noble metal catalysts.
DFT calculations are performed to further gain insights into the influence of oxygen vacancies for the OER and HER. First, the NiO slab model with oxygen vacancy (NiO-Vo) exposed with the (100) plane is constructed by a (3 × 3) supercell, and its properties are compared with those of NiO and Ni models (Fig. S29–S31†). Given the four-electron mechanism for the OER, we calculate the adsorption free energy of O-containing intermediates for the reaction process in alkali media.57Fig. 6c shows the rate-determining step for NiO, which is controlled by the conversion of OH* to O* with a ΔG of 2.11 eV, owing to the strong binding energy between Ni and OH*. After an O atom is removed as an oxygen vacancy, the free energy for the conversion of OH* to O* reduces to 1.55 eV, indicating a rapid OER kinetics. However, Ni displays a poor OER activity limited by the conversion of O* to OOH*, indicating that metal oxides play a significant role in the OER. The overpotentials of NiO-Vo, NiO and Ni are 0.32, 0.88, and 1.14 V, respectively, consistent with the above OER experiments and indicating that the high active site is generated around oxygen vacancies with the low overpotential of the OER. Fig. 6d shows the HER free-energy diagram. From the H* adsorption energy, a moderate value with ΔGH* ≈ 0 is suitable for the HER. The ΔGH* of NiO-Vo, NiO and Ni totals 0.1, 0.31, and −0.26 eV, respectively. The HER activities of Ni and NiO are determined by the hydrogen release step.58,59 However, this free energy of NiO-Vo for the HER indicates that the hydrogen adsorption strength on the oxygen vacancy site is weak compared with the top-site O atom on the surface of NiO, suggesting that NiO-Vo possesses a more optimal HER activity. The DOS is calculated for NiO-Vo and NiO to further gain insights into the intrinsic electron structure (Fig. 6e). The band gap of NiO-Vo is smaller than that of NiO, revealing the high conductivity and fast charge transfer with the formation of oxygen vacancy, which conform to the experimental EIS results.38 Therefore, the calculation illustrates that the NiO decorated with oxygen vacancy efficiently improves the conductivity and offers additional active sites for the OER and HER, further verifying that NiO-Vo@2D/3D NS@DSE is a remarkable electrocatalyst for overall water splitting (Fig. 6f).
Based on the above analysis and calculations, the excellent electrocatalytic performance of NiO-Vo@2D/3D NS@DSE for overall water splitting could be mainly attributed to the following reason. First, this electrode offers a novel structure with a multi-row dendritic skeleton. The unique open-porous electrode not only increases the surface area, but also eases the bubble release, further accelerating the electrolyte infiltration and mass transport. Second, the amount of 3D nanospheres covered with 2D nanosheets can offer considerable active sites for high-efficiency electrocatalytic performance. Then, the direct integration of 2D/3D nanospheres on the DSS provides an outstanding conductivity and fast charge transfer without the polymer binders. Meanwhile, the strong adhesion between 2D/3D nanospheres and DSS enhances the mechanical and electrochemical stability. Finally, from the DFT calculations, the NiO with rich oxygen vacancy, which uniformly distributes within the 2D/3D nanospheres, can efficiently optimize the electronic structure to enhance the electrical conductivity of NiO and intrinsic electrocatalytic activity, and further reduce the overpotential of the OER and HER based on theoretical calculation and electrochemical experiments.
In summary, we prepared for the first time a novel DSS by jet electrodeposition. After the simple acid etching process, the 2D NiO nanosheets adhering on the 3D nanospheres grown onto the surface of DSS are prepared, and NiO-Vo@2D/3D NS@DSE is obtained. The results show that specific amounts of oxygen vacancies decorated on NiO are uniformly embedded within the 2D nanosheets. Benefiting from the 2D/3D structure and an abundance of oxygen-vacancy defects, NiO-Vo@2D/3D NS@DSE offers a larger number of active sites and considerably enhanced intrinsic activity. Furthermore, this electrode exhibits outstanding overpotentials of 230 mV and 51 mV for the OER and HER, respectively, to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm−2, which is superior to those of Ni-based electrocatalysts. Meanwhile, a cell voltage of 1.51 V is required to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm−2 for overall water splitting. This work provides a novel synthesis route for high-efficiency and low-cost bifunctional self-supported electrodes and introduces a promising pathway for energy conversion applications.
