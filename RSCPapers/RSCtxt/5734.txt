    , Accepted 24th March 2020First published on 2nd April 2020AbstractMethylammonium (MA) is one of the main obstacles that hold back the commercialization of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Formamidinium (FA)-based perovskite is a promising photovoltaic material due to its higher thermal stability and smaller bandgap. However, despite the introduction of Cs+ in FAPbI3, the photoactive α-phase FAPbI3 can quickly transform into a non-perovskite hexagonal phase δ-FAPbI3, which limits its use in perovskite solar cells. In this work, we show that the dispersion of 2D (PEA)2PbI4 nanosheets into a Cs0.1FA0.9PbI3 thin film successfully prevents the transformation of the α-phase Cs0.1FA0.9PbI3 to the δ-phase. Because of the 2D (PEA)2PbI4 nanosheets, a higher quality perovskite thin-film was obtained with a longer carrier lifetime, lower trap state density, and enhanced stability. The resulting device achieves a high power conversion efficiency of 20.44%, which is one of the highest for MA-free perovskites and retains 82% of its initial efficiency after 800 h of aging study.
Introduction
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) revolutionized photovoltaic research showing an impressive improvement in power conversion efficiency (PCE) from 3.8% to 25.2%, a record for a recently developed technology. Organic–inorganic lead halide perovskites are star solar cell materials, due to their tunable bandgap, high absorption coefficients, ambipolar charge mobility, and long carrier diffusion length.1–3 Currently, PSCs with the highest certified PCEs contain MA cations4 that are degraded under humidity due to the hygroscopic nature of the alkylammonium cation. And it is demonstrated that significant decomposition effects already occur during annealing of a methylammonium lead triiodide perovskite at 85 °C even in an inert atmosphere.5 Also, under dry conditions, the methylammonium lead triiodide perovskite film degrades in the presence of both light and oxygen, which together induce the oxidation of halide anions through donation of electrons to the oxygen generating free radicals. The free radicals deprotonate the methylammonium cation and form highly volatile CH3NH2 and HI molecules that escape leaving PbI2 behind.6 In the presence of oxygen, HI could further be degraded to iodine (I2) and H2 by a redox reaction.7 I2 vapour also causes severe degradation of MAPbI3 perovskite due to chemical chain reactions.8 However, degradation of the methylammonium lead triiodide perovskite solar cells can still occur even without the decomposition of the perovskite absorber layer. The MA cations can also diffuse into the organic hole-selective layer of spiro-MeOTAD because of the built-in electric field during operation, thereby deteriorating the hole-transporting ability of spiro-MeOTAD and degrading the solar cell performance.9
The interaction of FA cations with the surrounding PbI6 octahedra was stronger than that of MA cations due to the higher probability of forming hydrogen bonds.10 It can also be demonstrated that the substitution of MA+ with FA+ cations inside the inorganic cage leads to greater robustness for the overall lattice and extends the material durability due to a different interaction between the organic molecules and the inorganic cage.11 As a result, the perovskite phase (α-phase, cubic) of FAPbI3 may be a better solar material than MAPbI3, due to the improved stability and low bandgap (∼1.48 eV).12–14 However, there are two main phases of formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI3), which are the photoactive black perovskite phase (α-FAPbI3) and yellow non-perovskite hexagonal phase (δ-FAPbI3). Unfortunately, α-FAPbI3 can be easily transformed into the undesirable δ-FAPbI3 at room temperature, which hindered its practical application in stable photovoltaic devices.15 To stabilize the α-FAPbI3 perovskite lattice, cesium cations (Cs+), which have a smaller ionic radius and stability against heat are partially replaced with FA+.16–18 However, to maintain the high efficiency with long-term stability, the improvement by substituting with a small amount of Cs+ is still not sufficient. To further improve the stability, 2D Ruddlesden–Popper phase layered perovskite with large alkyl ammonium cations has been developed.20 This 2D perovskite shows superior moisture stability, which covers the shortage of Cs+ substitution.15 There are two main techniques for the incorporation of 2D perovskite in 3D PSCs. One is the application of a mixture of alkylammonium iodide and formamidinium iodide with lead iodide. Snaith's group reported that incorporating n-butylammonium iodide (C4H9NH3I, BAI) with FA0.83Cs0.17PbI3 could enhance the crystallinity and stability.21 Lee et al. also included a small amount of 2D phenyl ethyl ammonium lead iodide ((PEA)2PbI4) in the 3D perovskite precursor solution to obtain a high-quality, stable 3D perovskite film.22 Shengzhong Frank Liu and Dong Yang gradually grew two-dimensional PEAI nanoplates between the grain boundaries of perovskite films by adding PEAI into a FA0.95Cs0.05PbI3 precursor solution.23 However, this procedure suffers from low efficiency due to the inhibition of out-of-plane charge transport by the insulating spacer cations.24 Another technique is the deposition of an ultrathin 2D perovskite passivation layer on the top surface of a 3D (FAPbI3)0.88(CsPbBr3)0.12 perovskite layer. Nam-Gyu Park and his co-workers introduced a (5-AVA)2PbI4 layer to passivate the defects of the perovskite surface and improve both the photostability and moisture stability.25 And introduction of a 2D perovskite overlayer on the top surface of a 3D perovskite by dynamic spin coating of a PEAI isopropanol (IPA) solution on an optimized lead excess pristine Cs0.1FA0.74MA0.13PbI2.48Br0.39 perovskite film was reported.26 Nevertheless, the 2D passivating layer only protects the surface of the 3D perovskite film, but achieving bulk α-phase stability remains a challenge. Recently, instead of the conventional post-treatment method, Tan et al. achieved in situ defect passivation both at the perovskite film surface and at grain boundaries within the film by introducing the passivation materials directly into an antisolvent, which has further translated into both stable and efficient perovskite solar cells.27 However, unfortunately, PEAI can only be dissolved in ethyl acetate and is insoluble in diethyl ether and chlorobenzene, even at a very low concentration of 0.5 mg mL−1 (as shown in Fig. S1†).
Here we develop a simple strategy to enhance the stability of the α-FAPbI3 perovskite lattice, where we incorporate 2D perovskite nanosheets into 3D perovskite. We dispersed 2D perovskite ((PEA)2PbI4) nanosheets in chlorobenzene as the anti-solvent to passivate the defects28 and stabilized the α-FAPbI3 crystal phase of perovskite. The 2D (PEA)2PbI4 nanosheets are successfully inserted into the 3D Cs0.1FA0.9PbI3, preventing the transformation of the α-phase Cs0.1FA0.9PbI3 into the δ-phase. In addition, this 2D perovskite enriched at the surface can passivate the 3D Cs0.1FA0.9PbI3 layer. The resulting perovskite thin-film exhibited a longer carrier lifetime, lower trap density, and enhanced stability.
Results and discussion
(PEA)2PbI4 nanosheets (NS) were synthesized using a facile anti-solvent method and the 2D perovskite (PEA)2PbI4 with bulky organic cations, which is highly stable.29,30Fig. 1a reveals the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the drop-cast thin film of (PEA)2PbI4 NS. The diffraction peaks are shown in the XRD pattern indexed to the (00l) (l = 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10) series of reflections, indicating excellent crystallinity and high purity.31 It is well known that a (PEA)2PbI4 NS suspension emits strong green fluorescence under ultraviolet (UV) light excitation.32Fig. 1b shows the UV-Vis absorption and photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the (PEA)2PbI4 NSs dispersed in chlorobenzene (CB). Due to the multiple electronic transition characteristics, a sharp peak centered at 536 nm in the PL spectra was observed, indicating the monodispersity of (PEA)2PbI4 NSs, consistent with the TEM results33 (see Fig. S2†).

The amount of (PEA)2PbI4 NSs plays a vital role in fabricating perovskite thin films. For comparison, the perovskite layers formed with different concentrations of (PEA)2PbI4 NS colloidal suspensions were labelled CF containing 0 mg mL−1 (PEA)2PbI4 NSs, CF NS1 containing 6 mg mL−1 (PEA)2PbI4 NSs, CF NS2 containing 12 mg mL−1 (PEA)2PbI4 NSs and CF NS3 containing 18 mg mL−1 (PEA)2PbI4 NSs. To examine the influence of (PEA)2PbI4 NSs on the surface morphology of perovskite films, SEM analysis of CF, CF NS1, CF NS2, and CF NS3 was carried out (Fig. 2a–d). A compact CF film without (PEA)2PbI4 NSs was formed with an average grain size of about 600 nm. After incorporation of (PEA)2PbI4 NSs, the overall morphologies of CF NS1, CF NS2, and CF NS3 are similarly compact but the average grain size is slightly reduced, which are shown in the grain size statistics image (Fig. S3†). The decrease of grain size in this work is in agreement with a previous report, which shows that nanocrystal (PEA)2PbI4 NSs can serve as additional heterogeneous nucleation sites and subsequently accelerate the perovskite nucleation process.34Fig. 2e exhibits the XRD patterns of CF, CF NS1, CF NS2, and CF NS3 on the TiO2/FTO substrate. The peaks located at 14.06°, 19.92°, 24.44°, 28.25°, 31.67°, 34.75°, 40.37°, and 42.92° are indexed to the crystal planes of pure Cs0.1FA0.9PbI3 as shown, which agrees with previous reports.35,36 Moreover, no additional new peaks or shifts of the diffraction peaks can be observed in the CF NS1, CF NS2, and CF NS3 XRD patterns. The enlarged view of the (110) XRD patterns at 14.06° shows no distinct shift (Fig. 2f). The UV-Vis absorption spectra of perovskite thin films of CF, CF NS1, CF NS2, and CF NS3 are shown in Fig. 2g. For all perovskite films, the absorption edge onset is at about 810 nm, and the spectra show no shift. Based on the results of SEM, XRD, and UV-Vis absorption analysis, we note that neither does the incorporation of (PEA)2PbI4 NSs change the cubic perovskite nor do the (PEA)2PbI4 NSs participate in the lattice formation of the 3D perovskite. The perovskite thin films with or without (PEA)2PbI4 NSs were prepared by a modified one-step method illustrated schematically in Fig. 2h.37 Briefly, during spin-coating of the perovskite solution, a drop of anti-solvent (with or without (PEA)2PbI4 NS) was dripped to assist the formation of perovskite crystals. The (PEA)2PbI4 NSs dripped on the perovskite layer not only acted as heterogeneous nucleation sites for the crystallization of 3D perovskite but also prevented α-FAPbI3 from converting into δ-FAPbI3. After spin-coating, a transparent intermediate film was formed, which after thermal annealing formed the perovskite thin film with abundant (PEA)2PbI4 NSs at the top surface, and its concentration gradually decreased at the bottom.38

Grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GI-XRD) is an effective technique to profile phase transformations as a function of depth, in which X-rays are incident on the sample surface at a low incident angle.39,40 The depth of X-ray penetration is a function of the incident angle (ω), as shown in Fig. 3a. When ω is changed from 0.3° to 4°, the X-rays penetrated from the surface to the interior. Fig. 3b and c show the ω-dependent XRD patterns of the CF film and CF NS2 film, respectively. With the increase of ω, the (110) peak position of CF NS2 perovskite shifts gradually to lower 2θ angles, whereas the shift does not occur in the CF film. In the CF NS2 film, the peak shift suggests that the crystal lattice is gradually expanded from the surface to the interior, which may be due to the fact that the (PEA)2PbI4 NSs are incorporated gradually into the perovskite thin film and the PEA2PbI4 NSs squeeze the 3D perovskite crystal phase from the grain boundaries. Steady-state PL spectroscopy is carried out to investigate the photogenerated charge carriers in the perovskite thin films (Fig. 3d).41 The PL peaks of all perovskite thin films exhibit different intensities. Compared to the CF film, the CF NS1, 2, and 3 films show higher PL intensities, indicating that the nonradiative recombination losses within the perovskite thin films are reduced.42,43 The (PEA)2PbI4 NSs can be treated by surface passivation which is beneficial for the reduction of nonradiative recombination. With the increase of the (PEA)2PbI4 NS concentration, the PL intensity increases. However, with a higher (PEA)2PbI4 NS concentration, the PL intensity of CF NS3 is lower than that of CF NS2. This could be attributed to the fact that the excess (PEA)2PbI4 NSs in the perovskite layer would act as nonradiative recombination centers to decrease the PL intensity. Additionally, the PL peaks of perovskite thin films with (PEA)2PbI4 NSs show a small blueshift, which is caused by the lower trap density in perovskite films.44 The time-resolved PL (TRPL) spectra also show slower decay rates after the incorporation of the (PEA)2PbI4 NSs (Fig. 3e). The average PL lifetimes (τavg) of the CF perovskite film and CF NS2 perovskite film are 66.14 ns and 186.08 ns, respectively. The PL fitting results are shown in Table S1 in the ESI.† The enhanced PL properties are attributed to the beneficial passivation of the film surfaces induced by the incorporation of the 2D (PEA)2PbI4 NSs.

To further explore the effect of the film performance after the incorporation of the 2D (PEA)2PbI4 NSs in the 3D perovskite layer, a series of additional measurements are carried out. The trap-state density (ntrap) is regarded as an important factor that impacts the quality of perovskite thin films and can be analyzed quantitatively using the space charge-limited current (SCLC) technique. Fig. 4a and b show the fitting dark J–V curves of the device based on CF and CF NS2 perovskite thin films, with an electron transport layer only device structure of FTO/TiO2/perovskite/PCBM/Au. The dependence of the current on the applied voltage shows three regions with the ohmic region (n = 1) at low bias showing a linear relationship between the current and the electric field, while the child region (n = 2) at high bias and trap-filling limit (TFL) region (n > 3) exhibit a sharp increase in the current. In the TFL region, traps are filled until the trap-filling limit voltage (VTFL) as bias increases,45 in which ntrap can be calculated using eqn (1):46,47 (1)where e is the elementary charge, L is the thickness of the perovskite layer, ε0 is the vacuum permittivity (∼8.85 × 10−14 F cm−1),48 and ε is the relative dielectric constant of the perovskite layer (adopted at ∼35).35,49VTFL is obtained from the fitting dark J–V curves; the VTFL values for the CF and CF NS2 are 0.78 V and 0.57 V, respectively. The calculated electron ntrap values for CF and CF NS2 based devices are 8.98 × 1015 cm−3 and 6.56 × 1015 cm−3, respectively. For the hole transport layer only device (shown in Fig. S4†), the VTFL values for CF and CF NS2 based devices are 0.23 V and 0.13 V. And correspondingly, the hole ntrap values for CF and CF NS2 based devices are 2.65 × 1015 cm−3 and 1.49 × 1015 cm−3, respectively. Both the electron and hole trap state densities decrease after incorporation of (PEA)2PbI4 NSs into Cs0.1FA0.9PbI3 perovskite thin films, which is the supporting evidence of the improvement of the quality of perovskite films by incorporating (PEA)2PbI4 NSs. The rapid nucleation and crystal growth of the FA0.9Cs0.1PbI3 film can effectively improve the transportation of the carriers.50 The low trap-state density of the perovskite film might be associated with the enhanced FF and VOC of the corresponding devices.

We have investigated the charge transfer dynamics between the perovskite layer and electron/hole transport layers, the steady-state PL, and TRPL. As shown in Fig. 4c, the PL peak of the CF NS2 based perovskite thin film with an electron transport layer (ETL) (TiO2) exhibited a blueshift compared with that of CF-based perovskite, which is attributed to the decreased trap states on the surface of the perovskite film. The corresponding TRPL spectra of perovskite thin films with TiO2 are shown in Fig. 4d. The average carrier lifetime (τavg) for CF perovskite/TiO2 is 161.70 ns, while for CF NS2 perovskite/TiO2, the τavg decreased to 20.69 ns (Table S2, ESI†). The shorter carrier lifetime implies that the electron extraction from perovskite to the ETL (TiO2) is accelerated via the incorporation of 2D (PEA)2PbI4 NSs, which is consistent with the reduced steady-state PL peak intensity. Fig. 4e shows the steady-state PL spectra of perovskite thin films with the hole transport layer (spiro-OMeTAD). A blueshift is also observed for PL peaks of CF NS2 perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD, which is due to the decreased trap states on the surface of the perovskite film. From the corresponding TRPL spectra of perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD shown in Fig. 4f, the average fitting carrier lifetime for the CF-based device is 31 ns and that for the CF NS2 based device is 20 ns. The slightly decreased τavg indicates that the hole extraction properties are also improved. Meanwhile, the enhanced VOC can be attributed to the carrier lifetime associated with the reduced trap densities.

Fig. 5a shows the device architecture consisting of FTO-glass, a compact hole-blocking TiO2 layer (c-TiO2), a mesoporous TiO2 electron transport layer (m-TiO2), a perovskite layer, a hole transport layer (spiro-OMeTAD) and a contact (Au). The J–V curves of the best devices based on CF and CF NS2 are shown in Fig. 5b. The CF-based device in the reverse scan shows a PEC of 18.44% with a Voc of 0.98 V, Jsc of 24.74 mA cm−2, and FF of 74.5%, while for the CF NS2-based device, the photovoltaic performance is enhanced with a PCE of 20.27% (Voc 1.054 V, Jsc of 24.76 mA cm−2 and FF of 77.9%), as summarized in Table S3.† The CF NS2 PCE is different from the PEAI 2D perovskite directly deposited on top of the 3D perovskite (as shown in Fig S5†). The J–V curve hysteresis for the CF NS2-based device shows a negative hysteresis, which could be related to the low trap state density (Fig. 5c).45 A stabilized power output curve is obtained by holding the voltage at the maximum power point (Vmax = 0.911 V) (Fig. 5d). The stabilized PCE of the CF NS2-based device is ≈20.26%, compared with that extracted from the reverse-scan J–V curve. The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) is obtained to confirm the photocurrent of the device.36 As shown in Fig. 5e, the CF NS2-based device displays enhanced charge collection over a broad spectral range from 350–810 nm. The integrated photocurrent densities of the CF-based and CF NS2-based devices are 24.06 and 24.87 mA cm−2, respectively, which are slightly lower than those obtained from the J–V curves. Given that the IPCE measurements are carried out without one-sun illumination, the integrated current densities from the IPCE curves are usually lower than those obtained from the J–V curves.51 With the comparison of IPCE between CF- and CF NS2-based devices, the higher light response of the CF NS2-based device implies that the incorporation of (PEA)2PbI4 NSs enhanced the photogenerated carriers in the perovskite layer. The detailed statistical photovoltaic performances of PSCs based on CF and CF NS2 are listed in Fig. 5f, which are summarized from more than 20 devices and listed in Table S4.† The parameters are enhanced with the incorporation of (PEA)2PbI4 NSs and distributed in a narrow range, suggesting excellent reproducibility.

(f) The photovoltaic statistics parameters of PSCs based on CF and CF NS2, which were measured in the reverse scan under one-sun illumination. 
The long-term stability is one of the key challenges for practical applications of PSCs. It is well known that the α-FAPbI3 is apt to convert to δ-FAPbI3, resulting in serious decreases in the photovoltaic performance.22 It is also demonstrated that PSCs based on Cs0.1FA0.9PbI3 are much more stable than those based on FAPbI3. After incorporation of (PEA)2PbI4 NSs, the chemical stability of the Cs0.1FA0.9PbI3 layer is increased. After 95 days of storage of CF and CF NS2 films in the ambient environment (shown in Fig. 6a), yellow spots appeared on the CF film but not on the CF NS2 film. We noticed that there are sticks in the CF film, which indicate δ-FAPbI3. In contrast, the CF NS2 film remains the same. Fig. 6b shows the XRD patterns of CF and CF NS2 thin films after 55 days' storage under a humidity of 70% at room temperature. The peak at 12° for the CF thin film without (PEA)2PbI4 NSs suggests the formation of δ-FAPbI3,52 while the XRD pattern of the CF NS2 thin film with (PEA)2PbI4 NSs does not show additional peaks, indicating that CF NS2 maintains its phase purity without phase-transformation and decomposition. Consequently, 2D (PEA)2PbI4 NSs incorporated in the perovskite thin film passivate the surface defects and slow the moisture ingression kinetics. The long-term stability of unencapsulated devices based on CF and CF NS2 is also measured under continuous white light (one-sun) illumination with a N2-flow atmosphere (temperature around 40 °C) for 800 h. From Fig. 6c, it can be seen that the device based on CF is degraded quickly within 100 h. And the PCE of the CF PSC retains only 30% of the initial PCE after 800 h, while for CF NS2 based devices, the PCE retains 80%, indicating that 2D (PEA)2PbI4 NSs enhance the device stability significantly.

Conclusions
We demonstrated that the inclusion of 2D (PEA)2PbI4 nanosheets in the 3D Cs0.1FA0.9PbI3 perovskite layer prevents the transformation of α-FAPbI3 to δ-FAPbI3. The gradient distribution of 2D (PEA)2PbI4 NSs serves as the passivation layer. Consequently, higher quality of the perovskite thin film is obtained with a long carrier lifetime and lower trap state density, resulting in a high PCE and long-term stability. As a result, the CF NS2-based device produces a considerable increase in the photovoltaic performance with an average PCE of 19.03%, when compared to the CF-based device with an average PCE of 18.11%, and the stability of devices with CF NS2 is vastly improved.
