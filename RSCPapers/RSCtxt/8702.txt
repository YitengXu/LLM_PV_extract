    , Accepted 1st July 2019First published on 15th July 2019AbstractThree novel perylene diimides featuring [1,2]dithiine and sulfur annulation onto the PDI core and different branched alkyl chains have been designed and facilely synthesized. The organic thin-film transistor (OTFT) devices based on the as-synthesized compounds showed maximum electron mobilities of up to 0.008 cm2 V−1 s−1 under an ambient atmosphere.
Perylene diimides (PDIs) have aroused particular interest over many years due to their high electron affinity, high electron mobility, and excellent chemical, thermal and photochemical stability.1 Their large and rigid π-conjugated plane endows the parent PDIs with good optoelectronic properties. The two imides with strong electron-withdrawing ability provide the central backbone with electron-deficiency characteristics. Therefore, PDIs are typical n-type semiconductors,2 for example, Wasielewski et al. reported cyano-substituted perylene diimides (PDI-CN2 and PDI-FCN2) with an electron mobility of 0.1–0.6 cm2 V−1 s−1 in air.2b These therefore demonstrate many potential applications in optoelectronic fields3 including electron and energy transfer,4 and as n-type organic thin-film transistors (OTFTs),5 building blocks in non-fullerene acceptors for organic photovoltaics (OPVs)6 and fluorescent sensors.7
In recent years, ever-increasing academic attention and significant progress toward the development of novel PDI systems have been witnessed with structural functionality via modification at the imide,8 bay9 and non-bay positions.10 Among diverse structural functionalizations, heteroannulation at bay is a fascinating strategy to fine-tuning their electronic structures and energy levels.6e,11 Moreover, heteroatom-decorated PDIs, especially chalcogen-annulated PDI derivatives exhibited synthetic accessibility and fascinating properties.6e,11b,12 Wang et al. synthesized bay-linked sulfur/selenium annulated PDI dimers SdiPBI-S and SdiPBI-Se with a twisted configuration and higher LUMO energy. Because of this, the PDBT-T1: SdiPBI-S and PDBT-T1: SdiPBI-Se solar cells exhibited a highly efficient power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 7.16% and 8.4%.6e,11b The Zheng group reported regioselective 2,5,8,11-functionalization of S-fused PDI via the less commonly observed 1,4-addition of aryl Grignard reagents, which showed a good PCE up to 5% of the single PDI core.6d
This encouraged scientists to explore other chalcogen-modified PDI derivatives and investigate their structure–property relationships, which is of great interest and importance to the field of organic photoelectric materials. Disulfane is a class of organic compounds containing a disulfide bond, exists widely in nature and have a broad range of applications in chemical biology,13 pharmaceutical industry14 and food chemistry.15 The vital motif demonstrates a critical role in the structures of proteins and plays an essential role in diverse activities of natural products, such as polycarpamine (anti-fungus) and epidithiodiketopiperazines (anti-poliovirus/P. falciparum).16 Accordingly, studies on synthetic methods and their attractive properties for disulfane compounds have been pursued for decades. Recently, the Wudl group reported disulfane-annulation PDIs, (2PDI-3S and 2PDI-4S) obtained in excellent yields, which deliver a PCE above 5% with relatively high fill factors (>60%) for non-fullerene acceptors.6c
Notwithstanding their great importance in numerous fields, effective research of disulfane based PDI derivatives (namely, dithiano-fused PDIs) has been seldom reported in the literature.17 Our group has been paying great attention to explore the synthesis and performance of PDIs decorated with heteroatoms.7,12b,18 By changing the structures of skeletons, the electronic structures, energy level variations and their optoelectronic features were systematically studied.
Herein, we report the synthesis, characterization and device performances of three novel dithiano-thieno annulated PDI derivatives featuring different branched alkyl side chains. These dithiano-thieno annulated PDIs possessed the characteristic feature of [1,2]dithiine and sulfur motifs fused onto one PDI core to extend the π-conjugation system. We found that dinitro-PDIs (Scheme 1) can be reactive with excess sulfur powder in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) solution through a one step reaction to obtain the corresponding products in good yields. The structural and photophysical as well as electrochemical properties have been fully investigated using experimental techniques and theoretical simulations. Furthermore, we also disclosed how the alkyl chain functionalization at imide positions affected the charge transporting performance of these PDI-based active layers.
 Scheme 1  Synthetic route of dithiano-thieno annulated PDI derivatives. 
The route to synthesize three target compounds is shown in Scheme 1. Firstly, treatment of parent PDIs (PDI-a, PDI-b and PDI-c) with excess fuming HNO3 in CH2Cl2 afforded double nitration reaction products (PDI-a2NO2, PDI-b2NO2 and PDI-c2NO2) in high yields, which showed a mixture of 1,6- and 1,7-regioisomers, consistent with the literature reports.19 For the sake of simplicity, we only show the 1,7-regioisomer in Scheme 1. Then the following cyclic condensation reaction was carried out with excess sulfur powder to successfully integrate the sulfur atom and the disulfide motif onto the electron-deficient PDI system (PDI-aS3, PDI-bS3 and PDI-cS3), which was obtained as a dark green solid after purification by column chromatography. The optimization of reaction conditions is shown in Table S4 (ESI†). Compared with the reported methods, our strategy demonstrated the merits of high yield, low-cost and synthetic flexibility. All of three molecules were obtained in good yields over 80%. The facile preparation also offers good side chain tolerance, in which three sets of alkyl groups (–C5H11, –C6H13 and –C20H41) were functionalized at imide positions. The target products were fully characterized by 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR, Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), and high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS, see the ESI†). All of these three materials exhibited excellent solubilities and can be dissolved in common organic solvents such as dichloromethane (DCM), chloroform, tetrahydrofuran (THF), and dimethylformamide (DMF). The thermal properties of the three materials were evaluated by thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), which revealed the decomposition temperature (Td, at 5% weight loss) higher than 300 °C under a nitrogen atmosphere (Fig. S26, ESI†). Similar to other PDI derivatives, all of them in the solid state and in solution also demonstrated remarkable photooxidized stability and are thus suitable for their future application in organic semiconductor devices.
The UV-vis absorption spectra of the as-synthesized molecules are displayed in Fig. 1 and relevant optical data are listed in Table S1 (ESI†). Compared with parent PDI derivatives (PDI-a, PDI-b and PDI-c), the dithiano-thieno counterparts exhibited red-shifted absorption with an onset of ∼750 nm due to the stronger electron-donating dithiano units.17b Moreover, all of three molecules present nearly identical absorption plots with well-defined vibronic π–π* transition bands in the range of 400–500 nm. In addition, the molar extinction coefficient of PDI-aS3 is apparently higher than that of the other two PDI target molecules. The optical bandgaps estimated from the onsets of the absorption spectra in solutions are 1.81 eV, 1.80 eV and 1.80 eV for the three compounds, respectively.
 Fig. 1  Normalized UV-vis absorption spectra of PDI-cS3 and parent PDI-c in THF (1.0 × 10−5 M) at room temperature. Inset picture shows PDI-cS3 and PDI-c. 
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was conducted to study the electrochemical properties of the three compounds (PDI-aS3, PDI-bS3 and PDI-cS3) in CH2Cl2 solution and the parent PDIs were also used for comparison. All of the compounds in solution showed similar redox behaviors with two reversible reduction waves (Fig. 2). The estimated lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels, according to the equation: ELUMO = −e[Ered + 4.80 − E(Fc/Fc+)], were −3.66 eV, −3.63 eV and −3.65 eV, respectively, which are obviously higher than that of the parent PDI by ca. 0.1 eV due to the three electron-donating sulfur atoms (Table S1, ESI†). The highest molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels estimated based on the irreversible oxidation peak, according to the equation: EHOMO = −e[Eox + 4.80 − E(Fc/Fc+)], were −5.71 eV, −5.67 eV and −5.67 eV, respectively. Therefore, the bandgap can be obtained according to CV data (Table S1, ESI†), which is consistent with the calculated results of optical bandgap.

To gain deep insight into the structural and electronic properties of dithiano-thieno annulated PDIs, DFT calculation20 (B3LYP/6-31G*) was performed on these molecules to obtain the optimized structures and orbital distributions of HOMO and LUMO energy levels. As demonstrated in Fig. 3 and Fig. S1 (ESI†), the electron clouds of HOMO energy levels were delocalized throughout the PDI core and the disulfide bond unit, while the LUMO energy levels were dominated by the perylene diimide core. Furthermore, the theoretically predicted HOMO and LUMO energy levels and the bandgap of three compounds fit quite well with the values obtained from the CV experiment (Tables S1 and S2, ESI†).

The high electron deficiency of the PDI molecules motivates us to investigate their electron-transporting properties. We fabricated organic thin-film transistor (OTFT) devices using dithiano-thieno annulated PDIs as organic semiconductors. The devices had a bottom-gate/top-contact (BG/TC) configuration fabricated on the SiO2/Si substrates. All the devices were measured under ambient conditions (relative humidity: 30–40%; temperature: 20 °C) and the charge carrier mobility was calculated from the saturation regimes. The detailed device performance parameters for all small molecules, including charge carrier mobility (μ), the threshold voltage (VT), and the current on/off ratio (Ion/Ioff) are shown in Fig. 4 and Fig S4 (ESI†), and the corresponding data are summarized in Table S3 (ESI†). These results implied that thermal annealing was helpful to improve the crystallinity of the film so as to enhance the charge transport properties; besides varying the alkyl side chain length on the molecule also had an important impact. PDI-aS3, PDI-bS3 and PDI-cS3 based devices all exhibited typical n-channel transporting behaviors and achieved the maximum electron mobility of 8.0 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 for PDI-cS3, nearly 130 and 72 times increase in electron mobilities with respect to PDI-aS3 (μe = 6.2 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1) and PDI-bS3 (μe = 1.1 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) based devices, respectively.

In order to disclose the large difference in electron-transporting properties, X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses were performed to investigate the crystallinity of PDI-aS3, PDI-bS3 and PDI-cS3 thin films annealed at different temperatures. As shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†), after annealing, the diffraction peak intensities of PDI-aS3, PDI-bS3 and PDI-cS3 films increased, reaching the maximum at 180 °C, 150 °C and 150 °C (the optimum annealing temperature) respectively, which indicated that the crystallinity of the three thin films apparently improved upon thermal annealing. The morphologies of the thin films were then investigated by atomic force microscopy (AFM) in tapping mode (Fig. 5 and Fig. S3, ESI†). As for the PDI-cS3 compound, thin films annealed at 80 °C revealed smooth and homogeneous morphologies featuring tiny grains, and the root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of PDI-cS3 thin films was calculated to be 0.53 nm. With the annealing temperature increased up to 150 °C, the RMS roughness amplified with higher annealing temperature, reaching the maximum at 150 °C of 2.97 nm (Fig. 5). For PDI-aS3 and PDI-bS3, the same trend of roughness, grain size and crystallinity changes as the PDI-cS3 thin film was observed, and the optimum annealing temperatures were at 180 °C and 150 °C, respectively. The AFM measurements were in good agreement with the XRD results, clearly confirming that an improvement in the crystallinity of the three small molecule thin films was observed upon thermal annealing. The reason for the best mobility of PDI-cS3 may be attributed to the good crystallinity and less boundaries. Meanwhile, this revealed that the same molecular backbone had different effects on the crystallinity and grain size of the film due to the difference in the alkyl side chain length.

In summary, the current work has demonstrated a protocol to access a series of dithiano-thieno annulated PDI derivatives featuring [1,2]dithiine and sulfur motifs fused with PDI at bay positions. They can be facilely prepared by two steps in good to excellent isolated yields through sulfur-induced nucleophilic substitution in NMP solution. The introduction of three sulfur atoms together has drastically influenced the optical and electronic properties of PDI, which shows a modest energy change in the LUMO levels and a remarkable energy increase in the HOMO levels. Further studies of these annulated PDI derivative-based OTFTs demonstrated that the difference in the alkyl side chain length of amide substitution had remarkable effects on the crystallinity, grain size of the film and n-channel behavior.
