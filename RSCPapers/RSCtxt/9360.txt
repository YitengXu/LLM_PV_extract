    , Accepted 20th April 2012First published on 23rd April 2012AbstractMonodisperse Er3+:NaGdF4@Ho3+:NaGdF4@NaGdF4 active-core/active-shell/inert-shell nanocrystals, which can extend the near-infrared wavelength excitable range for upconversion (UC) emissions, were successfully fabricated for the first time. Importantly, doping of Er3+ and Ho3+ into the core and shell respectively suppresses adverse energy transfers between them, resulting in intense UC emissions for both Er3+ and Ho3+ dopants.
The Sun provides the Earth with as much energy every hour as human civilization uses every year. If a small fraction of sunlight could be captured by photovoltaic (PV) cells that turn it straight into electricity, there would be no need to emit any greenhouse gases from any power plant.1 So far, one of the major problems in PV devices is related to the spectral mismatch between the incident solar photon spectrum and the band gap of the semiconductors on which the PV device is based.2–4 The standard terrestrial (AM1.5) solar irradiation spectrum covers the wavelength region from ultraviolet to infrared (300–2500 nm). However, crystalline silicon (c-Si) solar cells can only absorb radiation with energy larger than that of the Si bandgap of 1.12 eV corresponding to wavelength of 1100 nm. To reduce these transmission losses, using upconversion (UC) material to enable conversion of the sub-bandgap near-infrared (NIR) light (λ > 1100 nm) into the visible-NIR light (λ < 1100 nm) via UC processes might be a desirable approach.5 Theoretical studies based on detailed-balance calculations predicts a maximum conversion efficiency of 37.4% for the c-Si solar cell coupled with an ideal UC layer under non-concentrated sunlight irradiation.6
Lanthanide (Ln3+) ions are ideal UC emission activators due to their multiple long-lived intermediate levels.7 Among various Ln3+ ions, Er3+ and Ho3+ are of particular interest because they can be excited with NIR light transparent to c-Si solar cell and emit visible-NIR light above the c-Si bandgap. For instance, intense UC emissions at ∼545, ∼665, ∼800 and ∼980 nm were detected under ∼1500 nm laser excitation in Er3+:NaYF4,8 Er3+:ZrO2,9 Er3+:Gd2(MoO4)310 as well as Er3+:LiYF411 phosphors, and emissions at ∼650 nm, ∼910 nm were observed under 1170 nm excitation in a Ho3+ doped oxyfluoride glass ceramic.12 Since the concentration of Er3+ or Ho3+ ions in all the samples was high enough, energy transfer upconversion was the dominant mechanism owing to the strong multi-polar ion–ion interactions induced by short ion–ion distances.13 It is worth mentioning that incorporation of both Ho3+ and Er3+ into a single host is beneficial to the wide range utilization of NIR sunlight. Unfortunately, it is difficult to achieve both UC emissions of Er3+ and Ho3+via simply co-doping them into a sole host, since the adverse energy transfers between Er3+ and Ho3+ induce quenching of the UC emissions.
Herein, novel Er3+:NaGdF4@Ho3+:NaGdF4@NaGdF4 active-core/active-shell/inert-shell nanocrystals (NCs) are designed and fabricated which may extend the NIR wavelength range excitable for UC emissions, as schematically illustrated in Fig. 1. In these NCs, the intermediate shells not only play a passivation role to enhance the UC luminescence of Er3+ in the cores, but also act as the hosts to realize the UC luminescence of Ho3+. Importantly, the doping of Er3+ and Ho3+ into the core and shell respectively can effectively suppress the adverse energy transfers between Er3+ and Ho3+, resulting in the lessening of the UC emission quenching for both Er3+ and Ho3+ dopants.

Red part shows AM1.5 terrestrial solar spectrum; dotted curve denotes c-Si response spectrum; bandgap of c-Si is indicated by vertical arrow. 
The hexagonal NaGdF4 (NGF) NCs were synthesized following the route reported by Liu et al. previously.14,15 TEM observation (Fig. 2a) shows that the monodisperse Er3+:NaGdF4 NCs are near-hexagon-shaped with a uniform size of ∼8 nm (Fig. 2d). Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) (Fig. S1, ESI†) reveals the incorporation of Er3+ ions in the NaGdF4 NCs. In a further step, the synthesized Er3+:NaGdF4 core NCs were used as the seed crystals to grow the Ho3+:NaGdF4 shells, resulting in the formation of uniform, monodisperse Er3+:NaGdF4 active-core/Ho3+:NaGdF4 active-shell NCs (Fig. 2b) that were ∼14 nm in size (remarkably larger than the precursor cores). To reduce the emission quenching of Ho3+ on the surface of the NCs, another inert NaGdF4 shell was further grown on the active-core/active-shell NCs by the same way to form the Er3+:NaGdF4@Ho3+:NaGdF4@NaGdF4 NCs which were ∼20 nm in size, as exhibited in Fig. 2c. High resolution TEM (HRTEM) images (inset in Fig. 2d) reveal the high crystallinity of these NCs. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of these three samples, as presented in Fig. S2 (ESI†), verify that the products are pure hexagonal NaGdF4 (JCPDS 27-0699).

The UC emission spectra of several core and core/shell NCs under NIR laser excitation are shown in Fig. 3a. The optimal doping concentration of Er3+ and Ho3+ in NaGdF4 NCs is determined to be 15 mol%, as revealed in Fig. S3 (ESI†). Three UC emission bands at 539, 655 and 809 nm, corresponding to the transitions from 2H11/2/4S3/2, 4F9/2 and 4I9/2 to the ground state 4I15/2 of Er3+ respectively, are clearly observed under 1530 nm excitation. Compared with those in the core-only Er3+:NaGdF4 NCs, the Er3+ emissions in the active-core/inert-shell (i.e., Er3+:NaGdF4@NaGdF4) NCs are greatly intensified (for about 3 times), while they are obviously weakened (to about one-tenth) in the Er3+/Ho3+ co-doped NaGdF4 NCs. The UC decay lifetimes of the Er3+:2H11/2,4S3/2 → 4I15/2 (Fig. 3c) and 4I9/2 → 4I15/2 transitions (Fig. 3d) in the active-core/inert-shell NCs were found to be much longer than those in the core-only NCs, verifying the passivation role of the inert-shell which protects the Er3+ ions in the cores from non-radiative decay caused by surface defects. On the contrary, the Er3+ UC lifetimes corresponding to these two transitions in the Er3+/Ho3+ co-doped NaGdF4 NCs are much shorter than those in the Er3+:NaGdF4 NCs (Fig. 3c and 3d), revealing the quenching of Er3+ emissions induced by the adverse energy transfers from Er3+:4S3/2 and 4I9/2 to Ho3+:5F4, 5S2 and 5I5 respectively in the Er3+/Ho3+:NaGdF4 NCs. Similarly, the Ho3+ UC emission intensity in the Er3+/Ho3+:NaGdF4 NCs was found to be much weaker than that in the Ho3+:NaGdF4 NCs (Fig. S4, ESI†), and the corresponding UC decay lifetime is also shortened under 1160 nm excitation (Fig. S5, ESI†), which is ascribed to the adverse energy transfer from Ho3+:5F5 to Er3+:4F9/2 in the Er3+/Ho3+:NaGdF4 NCs.

Interestingly, in the Er3+:NaGdF4@Ho3+:NaGdF4@NaGdF4 active-core/active-shell/inert-shell architecture, both intense Er3+ and Ho3+ UC emissions are detected under NIR excitation (Fig. 3a). Unlike the cases in the Er3+/Ho3+:NaGdF4 NCs, the UC emission intensities of Er3+ and Ho3+ are not obviously weakened and the UC decay lifetimes of the Er3+:2H11/2,4S3/2 → 4I15/2 and 4I9/2 → 4I15/2 transitions are not remarkably shortened (Fig. 3c and 3d) in the Er3+:NaGdF4@Ho3+:NaGdF4@NaGdF4 NCs. These results confirm that doping of Er3+ and Ho3+ into the core and shell respectively, suppresses effectively the adverse energy transfers between Er3+ and Ho3+ due to the large ion–ion distances between them, resulting in the lessening of the UC emission quenching for both Er3+ and Tm3+ dopants. Worthy of note is that all the UC emission photons originated from the Er3+:2H11/2, 4S3/2 → 4I15/2 (539 nm), 4F9/2 → 4I15/2 (655 nm), 4I9/2 → 4I15/2 (809 nm), 4I11/2 → 4I15/2 (980 nm), and Ho3+:5F5 → 5I8 (645 nm), 5I5 → 5I8 (900 nm) transitions can be absorbed by a c-Si solar cell. On the other hand, the UC excitation spectra, shown in Fig. 3b, demonstrate that photons in the wavelength range of 1140–1250 nm and 1480–1600 nm, transparent to c-Si solar cell, can be converted into visible-NIR photons via the Ho3+ and Er3+ UC processes respectively. Therefore, by appropriately designing the Er3+:NaGdF4@Ho3+:NaGdF4 active-core/active-shell architecture, the ultra-broadband NIR photons can be absorbed by Ho3+ and Er3+, and converted to visible-NIR photons above the c-Si bandgap via UC processes.
The energy levels of Er3+ and Ho3+, as well as the proposed UC pathways in the active-core/active-shell NCs under NIR excitation are presented in Fig. 4. Generally, both excited state absorption (ESA) and energy transfer upconversion (ETU) can lead to the population of higher excited states for Er3+ and Ho3+. Since the concentration of Er3+ or Ho3+ (15 mol%) in the synthesized core/shell NCs is quite high (i.e., the ion–ion distances are short and the multi-polar ion–ion interactions are strong), ETU is regarded as the dominant UC mechanism.12 For the Er3+ ions in cores, the 1530 nm incident photons directly excite them from the 4I15/2 ground state to the 4I13/2 intermediate state, from which the 4I9/2 and the 2H11/2/4S3/2 states are populated via consecutive ETU processes (Fig. 4). The radiative decay from 2H11/2/4S3/2 to 4I15/2 generates a ∼539 nm photon. Meanwhile, the nonradiative relaxations from 2H11/2/4S3/2 populate the 4F9/2 state, from which a ∼655 nm photon is produced. Similarly, the radiative decay from 4I9/2 to 4I15/2 yields a ∼809 nm photon, while the nonradiative relaxations from 4I9/2 populate the 4I11/2 state, from which a ∼980 nm photon is emitted. For the Ho3+ ions in shells, the 1160 nm incident photons directly excite them from the 5I8 ground state to the 5I6 intermediate state, from which the 5I4 and the 5F4/5S2 states are populated via the consecutive ETU processes (Fig. 4). The nonradiative relaxations from these states populate the 5I5 and 5F5 states, from which a ∼645 nm photon and a ∼900 nm one are produced. As illustrated in Fig. 4, the adverse energy transfers between Er3+ and Ho3+ (Er3+ ↔ Ho3+) are suppressed in the active-core@active-shell architecture owing to the effective separation of Er3+ and Ho3+, which ensures the intense UC emissions for both Er3+ and Ho3+ dopants.

Finally, to enable the possible PV application of these active-core/active-shell NCs, it is first necessary to convert them from being hydrophobic to hydrophilic. Herein, via a micro-emulsion route, a thin layer of silica with a thickness of ∼6 nm was coated on the surface of the Er3+:NaGdF4@Ho3+:NaGdF4 NCs, as shown in Fig. 5. The silica coating indeed allows for the dispersibility of the NCs in polar solutions such as water. It is worth noting that the UC luminescent features of these NCs are not remarkably affected by such surface modification.

In summary, monodisperse and uniform Er3+:NaGdF4@Ho3+:NaGdF4@NaGdF4 NCs were successfully fabricated. The intermediate shell in this active-core/active-shell/inert-shell architecture not only plays a passivation role to enhance the UC luminescence of Er3+ in the core, but also acts as the host to realize the UC luminescence of Ho3+. Importantly, doping of Er3+ and Ho3+ into the core and shell respectively, suppresses effectively the adverse energy transfers between Er3+ and Ho3+, resulting in the intense UC emissions for both Er3+ and Ho3+ dopants. These novel core/shell NCs, which can be excited by ultra-broadband NIR photons transparent to c-Si and emit visible-NIR photons above the c-Si bandgap, may find potential application in c-Si solar cells to enhance the energy efficiency.
