    First published on 24th September 2018AbstractRuthenium polypyridyl type complexes are potent photoactive compounds, and have found – among others – a broad range of important applications in the fields of biomedical diagnosis and phototherapy, energy conversion schemes such as dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) and molecular assemblies for tailored photo-initiated processes. In this regard, the linkage of RuII polypyridyl-type complexes with specific functional moieties is highly desirable to enhance their inherent photophysical properties, e.g., with a targeting function to achieve cell selectivity, or with a dye or redox-active subunits for energy- and electron-transfer. However, the classical approach of performing ligand syntheses first and the formation of Ru complexes in the last steps imposes synthetic limitations with regard to tolerating functional groups or moieties as well as requiring lengthy convergent routes. Alternatively, the diversification of Ru complexes after coordination (termed “chemistry-on-the-complex”) provides an elegant complementary approach. In addition to the Click chemistry concept, the rapidly developing synthesis and purification methodologies permit the preparation of Ru conjugates via amidation, alkylation and cross-coupling reactions. In this regard, recent developments in chromatography shifted the limits of purification, e.g., by using new commercialized surface-modified silica gels and automated instrumentation. This review provides detailed insights into applying the “chemistry-on-the-complex” concept, which is believed to stimulate the modular preparation of unpreceded molecular assemblies as well as functional materials based on Ru-based building blocks, including combinatorial approaches.

1. Background and general aspects
The rise of RuII polypyridyl-type complexes dates back to the first reported synthesis of [Ru(bpy)3]2+ (where bpy is 2,2′-bipyridine) in 1936,1 and the subsequent discovery of luminescence in 1959,2 and its assignment to charge-transfer emission3 from a triplet state in 1968.4 Since then, these remarkable photophysical properties,5 recently assigned to the triplet metal-to-ligand-charge-transfer (3MLCT) excited state, have aroused chemists’ interest in this compound class, which is reflected by the continuously high publication numbers and, equally important, has matured to a wide range of application fields (Fig. 1). In fact, the importance of RuII polypyridyl-type complexes towards application originates from the conversion of photon energy into electricity or redox-chemical energy (or vice versa), as well as the modulation of optical properties due to molecular interactions (luminescent sensors). Because an exhaustive overview is far beyond the scope of this review, the interested reader is referred to selected recent reviews and key references covering the role of Ru complexes in the following applications: (a) light-into-electrical energy (e.g., in dye-sensitized solar cells6–28 or in electro-/chemi-luminescence29); (b) light-into-redox energy (e.g., by photoredox catalysis30–33 and for photochemical or photodynamic use in biomedicine); and (c) sensor and imaging applications (e.g., in NIR responsive and emissive materials,34 oxygen detection,35 anion sensing,36 the labeling of carbon materials (e.g., nanotubes),37–45 or biologically relevant targets such as DNA,46–57 cells,58–71 or sugars).72–75

Decay to the ground state (GS) proceeds via emission (vertical red arrow), or non-radiative pathways include direct coupling with GS (process II) or thermally-active population of 3MC states (process III). (b) Representative application fields, depending on the precise excited state characteristics (i.e., lifetime, energy, or emission quantum yield). See text and ref. 5, 77 and 78 for more details. 
The versatility of RuII polypyridyl-type complexes is further evident from synergistic combinations of the previous individual aspects, e.g., to form integrated chemiluminescent sensors triggered by anions or specific analyte molecules in life sciences.79,80 A particular distinction for Ru complexes originates from their exceptional synthetic versatility, e.g., the construction of molecular assemblies inspired by natural photosynthesis to study and mimic photo-induced electron81–83 and energy transfer steps,84–88 or to design sophisticated molecular machines such as switches or motors.89–91 The seminal work dating back to the 1970s was devoted towards elucidating the fundamental photophysical events and towards exploring the inherent photochemical properties. The ground and excited state properties have been thoroughly reviewed elsewhere (e.g., see ref. 5, 77 and 78). Fig. 1a depicts the sequence of key photophysical events – i.e., initial photon absorption, rapid intersystem crossing and relaxation to the 3MLCT state(s) are observed. The intrinsic deactivation can occur via radiative processes (emission), or non-radiative decay to the ground state via direct coupling, as often observed for cyclometalated complexes deduced from their energy gap law dependence, or via a thermally-activated process mediated by 3MC states, which is largely affected by the ligand field. Consequently, the 3MLCT state is characterized by its lifetime, energy content (emission energy) and emission quantum yield. In addition, energy- or electron transfer can occur to suitable donor and acceptor moieties, which are exploited in most of the applications of RuII polypyridyl-type complexes. In fact, the linkage pattern (bridge) between the RuII sensitizer and the functional moieties (e.g., energy-/electron donors or acceptors) can be utilized to control the rates of the energy and electron transfer steps, which are expressed in terms of the distance, the mutual orientation, and the degree of electronic communication.92–96 In conjunction with the facile functionalization of the Ru sensitizer units – as will be highlighted for representative examples in Section 5 – the rational design of sophisticated molecular assemblies involving multiple units is feasible. Note that, to date, the attachment of donor- and acceptor units has been predominantly performed at the stage of the ligand synthesis, which consequently leads to challenges in preventing false coordination modes in (hetero-)multimetallic assemblies, e.g., dendritic arrays for directional light harvesting or photo-catalytically active dyads comprising metal-based catalytic sites.97 The latter application aims to mimic the key events of natural photosynthesis and to transduce these principles to artificial systems,98,99e.g., to perform photo-initiated CO2 or H+ reduction,100,101 water oxidation102,103 or water splitting in general, as well as photo-initiated organic or organometallic reactions.104 Despite the high level of perception on mechanistic details, the complexity of the natural system and thus the orchestrated energy and electron transfer steps are hard to transfer to artificial molecular systems without substantial losses in efficiency. A major challenge for synthetic analogues arises from the necessity to harvest (multiple) photons before unfruitful recombination processes occur. In other words, the time scales of photochemistry and chemical events (catalytic steps) should match, in order to effectively convert photon energy into chemical bond energy. In this regard, it is important to note that the probably most challenging catalytic reaction, i.e., the water oxidation to release molecular oxygen in photosystem II (2H2O → O2 + 4H+ + 4e−), was described by sequential photon absorption already in 1970 (Kok's cycle),105 and that the simplest conceivable reaction on paper, i.e., proton reduction (2H+ + 2e− → H2), requires the capture of two photons. Hence, the forward electron transfer must out-compete any back electron transfer reaction, which is conveniently achieved by spatial translocation. In view of a sustainable working principle, the Ru sensitizer must be regenerated to harvest the next photon, while the donor/acceptor sites must accommodate multiple redox equivalent and/or transport charges in a directional fashion to prevent back reactions. The general functional requirements, as known for decades, can be mimicked by molecular assemblies composed of functional building blocks and require the optimization of the components’ interplay. Notably, the “molecular mimicry” can be augmented by immobilization onto inorganic particles or electrodes,99,103 in order to boost the efficiency as exemplified for dye sensitized solar cells or photoelectrochemical cells (TiO2, NiO, etc.), as well as heterogeneous water splitting (e.g., IrO2). Nevertheless, efficient and modular synthetic approaches towards such hierarchically defined molecular architectures are highly desired and will be discussed for the complementary “chemistry-on-the-complex” approach, which is believed to advance the use of functional Ru sensitizers.
Consequently, the following inherent properties of the Ru sensitizer have attracted particularly great attention for optimization: (1) the enhancement of visible light absorption for a better coverage of the solar spectrum, (2) the improvement of excited state properties (energy, life time, and quantum yield), (3) the adjustment of the redox potentials, and (4) the enhancement of chemical stability and photostability. In this regard, the family of reported RuII polypyridyl-type complexes has evolved tremendously to meet the specific application requirements, and is supported by ligand design that is corroborated by the increasingly reliable predictions from quantum chemical methods.76,106–117 The ligand modifications can be classified into variations of the scaffold (Fig. 2), i.e., replacing the pyridine subunits of 2,2′-bipyridine (bpy) or 2,2′:6′,2′′-terpyridine (tpy) by five-membered N-heterocycles or bridgehead/annulated ring systems, as well as carbanionic donors or carbenes (Fig. 2c). Consequently, a large number of conceivable bidentate (N^N) and tridentate (N^N^N) ligands can be constructed from these subunits, and further utilized to form the corresponding tris-bidentate complexes [Ru(N^N)3]2+ or bis-tridentate complexes [Ru(N^N^N)2]2+ (Fig. 2b). For many applications, a certain combination of photophysical and geometrical features is desired. For example, the Λ/Δ-isomerism of [Ru(N^N)3]2+-type complexes may be utilized for diastereomeric interactions, or may be avoided in donor–photosensitizer–acceptor assemblies due to the possible cis/trans isomers, which can be elegantly circumvented by exploiting the axial symmetry of [Ru(N^N^N)2]2+-type complexes (Fig. 2b, depicted by orange and blue colors), or more recently by the 2,6-di(quinolin-8-yl)pyridine (dqp) ligand family. Furthermore, the excited state properties may differ markedly, ranging from long-lived emission of [Ru(bpy)3]2+ and [Ru(dqp)2]2+ exceeding a few hundreds of nanoseconds to short-lived and, thus, practically non-emission of [Ru(tpy)2]2+ with less than a nanosecond. To a certain degree, the photophysical and electrochemical properties can be further adjusted by installing peripheral functional groups at the ligand scaffold. In summary, the coordination chemistry of RuII polypyridyl-type complexes has been investigated in detail, which led to established synthetic protocols of the complexation routes.

(b) Coordination geometry in tris-bidentate (featuring Λ/Δ-isomerism) and bis-tridentate RuII complexes, as well as cisoid and transoid arrangements of functional motifs (orange and blue). (c) Overview of subunits used to assemble ligands for 5-membered and 6-membered chelation modes. Typical subunits are: five-membered heterocycles, bridgeheads or ring-annelated heterocycles, and cyclometalates and carbenes. 
The majority of RuII polypyridyl-type complexes are prepared in two stages, i.e., initial ligand synthesis and the subsequent coordination steps. In this regard, the required organic intermediates and ligands can be readily synthesized as well as purified, e.g., by crystallization or chromatographic methods. The coordination step is usually performed under optimized conditions for the specific complex class. For example, typical bpy- and tpy-based complexes can be obtained around 80 °C, while dqp-based congeners or cyclometalated complexes require significantly elevated temperatures (120–140 °C). This synthesis strategy is attractive to prepare new Ru dyes from novel ligand platforms (Fig. 2a), since the purification of the Ru complexes is often the most challenging step. However, there are also undesired consequences following this route. Firstly, functional groups or moieties may not tolerate the reaction conditions (e.g., nitro-groups or biologically-active targeting subunits), or the ligand may facilitate unwanted coordination modes, which leads to low yields and cumbersome purification efforts (vide infra). Secondly, the substitution pattern is typically introduced in the early stage of the ligand synthesis and, thus, any (systematic) modification at this position implies the repetition of all intermediate steps, including the final coordination. Although such constraints may not be as limiting for the development of novel ligand platforms for Ru complexes, they hamper the utility of functional Ru complexes for combinatorial approaches or molecular assemblies, which often pursue a convergent synthesis strategy with several synthetic steps. Nevertheless, the development of advanced molecular architectures attracts increasing attention, e.g., by adding specific targeting groups for therapeutic or diagnostic applications, as well as the construction of molecular donor–acceptor materials for energy conversion applications. In this regard, performing reactions after the coordination step, denoted as “chemistry-on-the-complex” in the following, represents a promising complementary strategy to circumvent many of the challenges left by conventional routes and to utilize Ru complexes as functional building blocks for subsequent diversification steps. Nevertheless, only less than 3% of the reports on RuII polypyridyl-type complexes follow this strategy (Fig. 3), which is mainly limited by the challenging purification. In this regard, the recent progress in column chromatography offers a versatile tool to expand the scope of this underdeveloped area.

2. Scope and terminology
This review focuses on the reactions of RuII polypyridyl type complexes, referred to as “chemistry-on-the-complex”. Notably, such transformations, e.g., referred to as “building blocks”119,120 or “post-coordination functionalization”, have been occasionally reported over the years.121 In view of the recent progress of modern synthetic and, moreover, purification protocols, the “chemistry-on-the-complex” concept has become generally applicable for preparing novel functional materials, e.g., utilizing targeting moieties for biomedical application or redox-active and catalytically active moieties for tailored energy conversion applications.
This review is organized into four main sections: first, the essentials of typical complexation routes for the ligand syntheses (Section 3.1) and the corresponding coordination protocols (Section 3.2) are presented, which presents the starting point for the “chemistry-on-the-complex” strategy of functionalized Ru complexes. Next, the principle reactions to install or to interconvert functional groups are introduced (Section 4.1), which further refers to the “conjugation” with functional molecular fragments through C–C, C–O, C–N, and C–S bond formation (Section 5). Representative showcases of multimetallic Ru-containing macrocycles and star-like assemblies will be highlighted (Section 5.1), followed by a section dedicated to amidation as one of the most powerful linkage methodologies (Section 5.2.1). Subsequently, related esterification (Section 5.2.2) and alkylation reactions employing N-, O-, and S-nucleophiles (Section 5.4) are described, followed by Pd-mediated cross-coupling methodologies (Section 5.5), modern cycloaddition reactions (Section 5.6) and various polymerization techniques (Section 5.7). The second part details the analytical and preparative aspects of various general purification techniques (Section 6). Owing to the importance of chromatographic methods for purification, the related art and modern developments will be discussed in a separate section (Section 7).
However, in many instances a direct comparison between several synthetic or purification methods is difficult, as the applied conditions often descend from the individual empirical experience that matured within the respective research groups. Consequently, a mere evaluation of a given method in terms of isolated yields, the number of reports, the number of repeated chromatographic runs, or chronicling the publications may lead to an incomplete picture. Hence this review is intended to present representative key studies as well as to provide comprehensive tables, in order to serve for orientation for a specific reaction type or purification protocols. Particular discussion is devoted to the seminal work on polynuclear dendrons and star-like complexes (e.g., Balzani, Sauvage, Newkome, Constable, Tor, Ward and others), Ru–polymer architectures (e.g., Meyer and others), Ru–metal assemblies towards artificial photosynthesis (e.g., Åkermark and others), methodological improvements in solid-phase amide linkages (e.g., Heinze and others) and the systematic developments of chromatographic purification protocols (e.g., Keene, Fletcher, and others). Additional selected showcases will be detailed to provide also recent insights. In essence, the success in introducing novel synthetic methodologies to the field of Ru chemistry is closely tied to the capabilities of powerful purification techniques – i.e., both aspects are essential to prosper beyond the challenges set by the coordination step and to effectively extend the “chemistry-on-the-complex” approach for the aforementioned broad range of application fields.
3. Complexation chemistry
The classical synthesis of ruthenium complexes is based on the initial ligand synthesis and subsequent coordination as the final step. In the last few decades, a broad range of heterocyclic precursors has become commercially available to assemble the ligand framework, leading to the rapid development and screening of novel combinations within the past years. Equally important, the availability of ligands and prototypical RuII complexes as well as the established synthetic routes greatly facilitated their use by groups focusing on applications,122,123e.g., for solar cells, imaging and sensing, as well as biomedical applications.
3.1. Ligand syntheses
The syntheses of pristine pyridyl-type ligands (bpy and tpy) originally started from dehydrogenating coupling reactions of pyridine, but the conditions are usually incompatible with most functional groups. Remarkable progress in the ligand synthesis was made by applying ring-forming reactions, i.e., Kröhnke-type reactions to construct the central pyridine ring in tridentate ligands (e.g., tpy or dqp), or Skraup-type reactions to form the heterocyclic subunit from anilines (e.g., phen or dqp). The most recent approach utilizes modern C–C bond forming reactions of the aromatic subunits, i.e., relying on the Negishi, Stille and, particularly, Suzuki coupling protocols. Notably, the C–C couplings tolerate most of the organic functional groups, while the ring-forming reactions tolerate versatile aryl halides groups – leading to a wide range of functionalized ligand sets.
3.2. Coordination chemistry
The preparation of RuII polypyridyl-type complexes is outlined in Scheme 1 for the prototypical complexes of tris-bidentate [Ru(N^N)3]2+ or bis-tridentate [Ru(N^N^N)2]2+. The different routes generally start from RuIIICl3 hydrate as the primary metal source, which may be converted to alternative RuII or RuIII sources (black boxes). Depending on the exact reaction conditions, the direct formation of homoleptic RuII polypyridyl-type complexes can be achieved; however, in most cases heteroleptic RuII complexes are desired, which are usually prepared through the corresponding [RuII(N^N)2Cl2] or [RuIII(N^N^N)Cl3] intermediates. The stepwise coordination by the final chelating ligand becomes possible upon removal of the chlorides, e.g., by AgI-assisted halide abstraction. In all cases, the use of RuIII salts requires the concomitant reduction to RuII by the solvent (e.g., alcohols) or by sacrificial reductants (e.g., N-alkyl morpholines). In essence, this synthetic strategy is well established for bpy and tpy ligands, but may lead to challenges when directly transferred to alternative ligand sets. Firstly, the RuIII can act as an oxidant, which may open pathways for subsequent undesired ligand degradation pathways, particularly of redox-sensitive functionalities. In this context, the oxidation power of RuIII is “transiently” enhanced upon AgI-promoted removal of the charge-compensating anionic chloride, so that the extent of concurring side reactions depends on the sequence of the individual coordination events and the reduction step. In addition, RuIII was also found to coordinate preferentially to alcoholate oxygens, which even enforced the de-coordination from a pyridine nitrogen as revealed by the electrochemical hysteresis of a Ru complex featuring an ambidentate ligand set.124 This observation further suggests that the RuIII state may potentially lead to false coordination with oxygen-containing functional groups, in particular if chelating modes are sterically possible. As a consequence, the bridging of (multiple) Ru centers by one chelating ligand cannot be ruled out. It appears that the acute bite angle of bpy and tpy inherently restricts the extent of wrong coordination; nevertheless, alternative binding modes were reported even for the archetypical tpy ligand framework. The work by Thummel et al. detailed the pentaaza-coordination in [Ru(N^N^N)2Cl]+ complexes from the [Ru(N^N^N)Cl3] intermediates by 1H NMR and X-ray crystallography.125 These two selected examples demonstrate the richness of alternative binding modes assigned to the RuIII chemistry, which is further indirectly corroborated by the modest overall yields (around 50%) of the desired RuII polypyridyl-type complexes.

Synthesis starting from the representative Ru sources (black boxes) proceeding through RuIII (top) to RuII (bottom part) coordination chemistry. (a) RuIII precursor suggested for π-extended N^N^N ligands. (b) RuII precursor for selective ligand exchange for bpy and tpy. (c) Bench-stable RuII intermediates for N^N^N circumventing ill-defined [RuIII(N^N^N)Cl3]. See text for a detailed explanation. 
Hence, improved coordination routes have been developed starting from various RuII sources, e.g., [RuII(DMSO)4Cl2],126,127 [RuII(arene)Cl2]2 complexes (arene = cymene, benzene, mesitylene, etc.),128 or the chloride-free [Ru(MeCN)6]2+ complex.129 Noteworthily, the stepwise coordination of the chelating ligands (N^N or N^N^N) can be achieved by exploiting the different labilities of the Ru–L bond (L = DMSO, Cl). Alessio detailed the synthetic utility of [Ru(DMSO)4Cl2]. Although various intermediate isomers with different reactivities were identified, i.e., linkage of DMSO via the S or O donors, respectively, as well as cis-/trans-coordination isomers of the two chloride ligands, the [RuII(DMSO)4Cl2] precursor has been successfully utilized for a range of bidentate and tridentate ligands. In general, DMSO can be more readily replaced than chloride, which permits the introduction of two N^N ligands to form the intermediate [Ru(N^N)2Cl2] complex. In addition, stoichiometry control of the ligand-to-precursor ratio (1:1) can yield the mono-bidentate [Ru(N^N)(DMSO)2Cl2] intermediate. More importantly, the replacement of the remaining chlorides by the third N^N ligand required higher reaction temperatures (usually in refluxing ethylene glycol).126 Similarly, the Ziessel group demonstrated the versatility of [Ru(DMSO)4Cl2] for the mild stepwise complexation for tridentate ligands based on tpy. In this case, the first coordination step is performed in chloroform to yield the [Ru(tpy)(DMSO)Cl2] intermediate, which is subjected to the coordination of a second tpy ligand upon AgI-promoted halide abstraction in refluxing methanol. In a similar fashion, [RuII(arene)Cl2]2 complexes (arene = cymene, benzene, mesitylene, etc.) were used for the stepwise coordination. As a consequence, higher yields and more reproducible synthetic protocols towards homo- and heteroleptic RuII complexes were reported, including the mono- and bis-bidentate RuII intermediates as well as the mono-tridentate congener. An exception is given by the dqp ligand family, which was found to require a RuIII source to facilitate the selective tridentate coordination of the first dqp ligand.130,131 The preparation of [Ru(dqp)(MeCN)3]2+-based complexes from related π-extended tpy ligands was recently improved by employing the defined [RuIII(PhSiPr)2(MeOH)Cl3] precursor and applying optimized conditions.132 Nonetheless, RuII precursors are applicable also for a multitude of cyclometalating ligands (N^C, N^C^N, or N^N^C). For these ligands, the deprotonation of the C–H bond is necessary and often requires higher temperatures. Note that strong bases (e.g. BuLi) were found to be incompatible for tpy,133 which suggests an even more pronounced base-sensitivity of the corresponding complexes (vide infra). This challenge is elegantly circumvented by exploiting AgI-stabilized carbanionic ligands using Ag2O in case of a sufficient CH-acidity, which is particularly suited for electron-deficient heterocycles (e.g., 1,2,3-triazoles).134–136
In summary, the versatility of a synthesis route is often evaluated in terms of the overall yield. However, side reactions occur inevitably to form RuII byproducts, which demand a versatile purification protocol to remove such impurities. An illustrative early example is provided by the opposing luminescence data reported for [Ru(tptpy)2]2+ (where tptpy is 4,4′,4′′-triphenyl-2,2′:6′,2′′) by the groups of Crosby137 and Sauvage.138 In the course of their study, Sauvage and coworkers stated the necessity to perform careful column chromatography to remove luminescent impurities.138 Notably, the separation of dicationic RuII complexes can become elaborate or even become unsuccessful in the case of intractable mixtures, which renders the applied synthetic route impractical in the final stage (Section 6). In this context, the “chemistry-on-the-complex” offers an alternative strategy, as common building blocks can be prepared under optimized conditions and subsequently diversified for their desired task.
4. “Chemistry-on-the-complex”
The chemical transformation of ruthenium complexes after coordination has been used since their rise in the 1970s. However, various alternative synonyms have occurred in the literature, e.g., post-coordination, or such reactions were not termed explicitly. In order to warrant a comprehensive overview, chemical databases were screened by structural transformation classified by C–C, C–O, C–N, or C–S formation/breakage, complemented by a keyword search for related name reactions, e.g., “Sonogashira” or “Suzuki”, or “Amidation”, to name a few. All publications from this initial survey that met the “chemistry-on-the-complex” criteria were included and categorized in the following sections: first, an overview of the conversion of functional groups is provided, which usually aims at tailoring the photophysical and redox-chemical properties of the Ru sensitizer. In the subsequent section, the conjugation of Ru complexes with other functional molecular fragments will detailed, which is highly attractive for specific recognition processes (targeting functions in life science applications) or to control light-induced electron- or energy transfer processes in discrete donor–acceptor assemblies (Fig. 4). For this task, the amidation reaction and the Sonogashira cross-coupling reaction were found to be most popular for biological compounds. Nucleophilic substitution reactions (e.g., Williamson etherification) as well as various cross-coupling methodologies (e.g., Suzuki, Stille and Negishi reactions) have also been reported. Finally, the polymerization of Ru-containing monomers is discussed, which represent an active field in materials science for highly responsive sensor applications or for energy conversion.

4.1. Conversion of functional groups
Functionalized Ru complexes are conventionally prepared from their corresponding ligands – i.e., the functional group is already introduced during ligand synthesis. Most of the typical functional groups can withstand coordination conditions, while others may suffer from chemical instability. In the context of the more challenging purification of RuII complexes vs. their organic predecessors, it is important to realize that even a small extent of side reactions imposes substantial tedious purification efforts (vide infra). For example, esters may be hydrolyzed or undergo transesterification reactions with alcoholic solvent used during the coordination steps, nitro groups may become reduced, or iodides and boronic acid derivatives may be cleaved to name only a few. Note that most functional group patterns may also be directly accessible through coordination. However, the conversion of functional groups after coordination can provide a complementary strategy, in particular for modular synthesis strategies and in case of difficulties associated with undesired coordination modes during complexation. The general reactivity of Ru complexes can be grouped into redox-reactions of the metal center (RuIII/II) as well as transformations of functional groups. Firstly, higher oxidation states are stabilized by anionic ligands: e.g., chloride ions are more strongly bound to RuIII centers than, e.g., neutral solvent molecules. In addition, the reactivity of the functional groups that are bound directly to the ligand scaffold is affected by the electron withdrawal due to the cationic Ru center. Since the ligands often consist of electron-deficient heterocyclic subunits, nucleophilic attack in the case of an appropriate leaving group (Cl) or reduction (NO2) can occur. Notably, cyclometalated RuII complexes can be subjected to selective CH-activation reactions of the electron-rich (carb-)anionic subunits. Finally, functional groups that are not directly bound to the ligand framework undergo their typical transformations. Scheme 2 illustrates that the most important reactions of functional groups bound directly to the ligand framework, as highlighted by selected examples.

The CH-activation is selectively possible for cyclometalated complexes, whereby the carbanionic ring is halogenated or nitrated in the presence of a suitable oxidant (Scheme 2a). The nitration was achieved by AgNO3/PhOCl139 or CuNO3,140–142 while the halogenation was obtained using CuCl2 or CuBr2 to form the respective functionalized complexes.143 Notably, an excess of the copper(II) halide is used to prevent undesired dimerization, which suggests the intermediate radical character that is stabilized by RuIII.143 Alternatively, bromination can be readily achieved with N-bromosuccinimide (NBS),144–149 while iodation occurs with I2 and PhI(OAc)2.144

Scheme 2b depicts examples for representative functional group conversions, which are typical for [RuII(N^N)3]-type and [RuII(N^N^N)2]-type complexes. Further details and specific examples are provided in Section 5, as these reactions are often applied to connect functional molecular fragments.
The conversion of nitro groups into the corresponding amino functionality can be cleanly achieved using RANEY® Nickel. Although the amino group is often introduced via the corresponding ligand, the transformation of the functionalized complex circumvents potential false coordination modes during complex formation. The amino group serves as a valuable precursor for subsequent amidation reactions, which will be discussed in more detail in Section 5.2.1. The selective oxidation of alkyl groups is rare, but reported for the benzyl positions by potassium permanganate.150 Following this procedure, phenyl-spaced carboxylic acid groups can be introduced onto the corresponding RuII complex. Given the importance of carboxylic acid groups for the immobilization of RuII complexes onto n- or p-type semiconductors (TiO2, NiO, etc.) for photovoltaic and photocatalytic applications, the saponification of the ester derivatives is the preferred universal route. Note that the direct coordination of the amphiphilic ligands bearing the free acid groups is challenging due to the low solubility caused by the intermolecular hydrogen bonding between the acidic carboxyl protons and the basic pyridine nitrogen atoms. Likewise, the high polarity and the possibility of acid–base equilibria enhance the solubility of the corresponding RuII complexes in protic solvents including water considerably, while the solubility in organic solvents is usually decreased. Hence, purification is often based on excessive washing as chromatographic purification is hampered by the strong adsorption onto the SiO2 surface. Nonetheless, the hydrolysis of esters can be promoted under basic conditions by water/NEt3 mixtures,151,152 LiOH,15 NaOH15,16 or NBu4OH,19,153–155 as well as aqueous sulfuric acid.11,112 Notably, related phosphonate ester derivatives can be hydrolyzed in aqueous HCl,156 or by trimethylsilylbromide157 or trimethyliodide,158 respectively.
The electron-deficient nature of pyridine rings, which is even more enhanced by the coordinated RuII center, renders the para-position of chloride-decorated RuII complexes susceptible to nucleophilic replacement. For example, refluxing in aqueous NaOH159 or KOH160 in a water/THF mixture yields the corresponding hydroxyl substituent.
The utilization of halogen substituents has attracted great attention in Pd-mediated cross-coupling reactions. The borylation of bromine-decorated RuII complexes and subsequent Suzuki–Miyaura cross-coupling has been demonstrated by the Williams group using a neopentyl-based diboron reagent (B2neo2) and Pd(dppf)Cl2.133 Analogously, the cyano group can be introduced in a catalytic reaction employing Pd2(dba)3, dppf, ZnCN2 and zinc dust.161,162 Numerous catalytic systems have been reported for alternative C–C bond forming reactions, ranging from various combinations of Pd pre-catalysts and ligands based on phosphines163 or N-heterocyclic carbenes,164–166 to nanoparticles167 or metal–organic frameworks (MOFs).168 In general, after the stage of the initial oxidative addition to the active catalyst,164,167–172 a variety of coupling partners can be used in the corresponding Suzuki–Miyaura coupling,163,173–175 Sonogashira reaction,176,177 Heck coupling175 or Stille reactions.178
In summary, the aforementioned methods demonstrate that various synthetic transformations of functional groups directly bound the ligand framework, which has a profound impact on the photophysical and redox-chemical properties.
5. Conjugation strategies
The previous section introduced the inherent reactivity and conversion of functional groups attached to the ligand scaffold. In this section, the most important methods are detailed for the coupling of a ruthenium complex with a functional molecular fragment. Noteworthily, these transformations often occur at peripheral functional groups that are decoupled from the Ru complex by various organic spacer units, so that the intrinsic reactivity resembles those of the “organic” counterparts. This strategy is termed “conjugation” in the following, owing to the success and the importance in the field of life science application, i.e., to connect specific targeting or therapeutic function to the complex.
5.1. Complexation of metal-containing fragments
Dendrimers as well as star-shaped and macrocyclic multinuclear systems are highly attractive model compounds to study fundamental energy and electron transfer steps, including directional cascades and multi-photon processes.179 The utility of these architectures to elucidate fundamental photophysical processes originates from their inherent symmetry to simplify data analysis, as well as their synthetic advantage of linking multiple units in a single step by the same type of reaction (Fig. 5).
 Fig. 5  Schematic representation of the synthesis of stars and macrocycles: (a) synthesis of the arms-first and coordination to the core; (b) macrocyclization from metal-containing fragments; (c) decoration of the arms onto the ruthenium core; and (d) stepwise pathway for the synthesis of dendrimers (see also Fig. 6). The final reaction steps are indicated by arrows (magenta). 
Multimetallic macrocycles can be formed from one precursor unit, while star-shaped congeners are composed of a core and a corona and, thus, imply two different metal-containing subunits (e.g., RuII, OsII or FeII). Historically, the undesired coordination modes in the fully assembled ligand framework were blocked, e.g., by methylation of the pyridines. Then, a sequential coordination–deprotection–coordination strategy was pursued for the iterative synthesis of dendrimer generations (Fig. 6).179

Although efficient directional energy transfer was achieved in these strongly-coupled polynuclear complexes, the excited state lifetimes and quantum yields were often unfavorably altered in comparison to the [Ru(bpy)3]2+ reference complex. Hence, strategies to reduce the electronic communication were pursued subsequently.179,180 In this regard, Ru complexes were functionalized via attachment of the free ligands and subsequent complexation. The convergent synthesis strategy starts with the preparation of the corona followed by the formation of the core in the last step (Fig. 5a). Heteropentamer and heteroheptamer star complexes were synthesized by the Constable groups via the first strategy.181,182 Several Williamson ether syntheses were performed to create a spacer between the peripheral ruthenium units and the free bpy moiety, which was used to form the iron or cobalt core. Also the synthesis of a related tetranuclear architecture is reported, which contains Ru or Os in the core.183 In this case, functionalized [Ru(bpy)3]2+ complexes were connected via aza-coupling to free bpy units that were finally complexed by osmium. Note that a variety of further dendritic and star-like structures have been reported, which share the complexation as the final step and, thus, will not be further discussed.
In this context, a six-membered macrocycle containing ruthenium and iron ions was synthesized in a stepwise fashion (Fig. 5b).184 The first step is the coordination of a bis-terpyridine to the [Ru(tpy)Cl3] complex to obtain a binuclear compound which can be further functionalized via the Sonogashira reaction. In the following step, the new terpyridine units bearing an acetylene function were introduced. Two of these half rings can form the macrocycle from an FeCl2 source. Another hexameric macrocycle containing iron and ruthenium centers was reported by the Newkome group.185 In this example, a [Ru(tpy)2]2+ unit was equipped via the Sonogashira reaction with two tpy units, which were subsequently complexed by FeII ions to form an iron-based hexameric macrocycle with six peripheral [Ru(tpy)2]2+ units.
The alternative divergent strategy starts from a highly-functionalized metal complex core (Fig. 5c) to attach multiple peripheral moieties. Note that in contrast to the convergent approach, incomplete functionalization and/or side reactions are challenging to separate. In most of the cases of multimetallic assemblies, a free ligand is added followed by complexation. Lee et al. reported the decoration of a [Ru(bpy)3]2+-type core with bpy units via esterification (Section 5.2.2).186 The key synthetic steps involve the core formation from di(hydroxymethyl)bipyridine and a ruthenium-cymene precursor, which was subsequently linked to six bipyridine mono-carboxylic acid units employing peptide coupling reagents (vide infra). The final coordination steps employed the AgI-activated bis-bidentate [Ru(N^N)2(acetone)2]2+ precursor bearing peripheral ligands N^N based on bpy or phen derivatives. Notably, various monometallic star-shaped complexes were reported following the divergent approach, which will be briefly mentioned for completion albeit no final coordination step occurs. The Gerald Meyer group reported the Sonogashira coupling of a hexabromo-decorated [Ru(bpy)3]2+ complex to attach the methyl ester of isophthalic acid for immobilization onto TiO2.187–189 The successful adsorption onto TiO2 was assigned to the 12 anchor units present, although these units bind more weakly to the semiconductor than carboxylates and, moreover, display different charge transfer and electron injection kinetics due to the different electronic communication between the sensitizer and the semiconductor.187–189 The introduction of similar anchor units is also possible via copper-mediated azide–alkyne cycloaddition reactions, e.g., to attach carboxyl190 or phosphonate groups.191 Also the use of such highly-functionalized complexes as initiators for controlled radical polymerization techniques is reported (Section 5.7), e.g., using reversible-addition–fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization192,193 as well as atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP).194,195 The latter examples feature the divergent character of multiple reactions of a central Ru unit, which descended from multimetallic architectures assembled via coordination and advanced the “chemistry-on-the-complex” methodology to various other fields based on selective linkage reactions, which will be discussed in detail in the following.
5.2. Acylation reactions

5.2.1. Amidation. 
The amidation reaction represents a highly developed and versatile tool to link two molecular fragments, originating from the ground-breaking work in peptide chemistry. Due to their mild reaction conditions and selective activation by coupling reagents, the established protocols are generally applicable to RuII complexes, e.g., for the decoration with amino acids, peptides, proteins or DNA. Because the amide bond is directional (–CONH– vs. –NHCO–), two complementary linkage patterns are conceivable (Fig. 7a). For example, carboxyl-functionalized [Ru(bpy)3]2+ and amino-decorated [Ru(bpy)2(phen)]2+ represent the most frequently employed Ru complexes, whereas various coupling reagents are used in combination with N-based bases (TEA, DIPEA or pyridine) (Fig. 7b). Notably, the mild amidation conditions can be transferred beyond medicinal chemistry and biochemistry, e.g., to attach polymer chains, carbon nanotubes, catalytic sites or redox active centers as well as additional chromophores for use in energy and electron transfer.

(b) Typical functionalized complexes, i.e., carboxyl-decorated [Ru(bpy)3]2+ (left) and amino-decorated [Ru(bpy)2(phen)]2+ (right), including peptide coupling reagents (middle). See text for details, and Table 1 for abbreviations of coupling reagents. 
The following section is organized according to the type of functional moiety that is linked via amidation to a RuII complex. Table 1 summarizes the reported examples to detail the reaction conditions, information regarding the tolerated functional groups and moieties, and the yields (if stated). For completion, related coupling reactions (e.g., thiocarbamate-linkages) are mentioned in the text.

Ru-Bioconjugates. 
In the past decade, the amidation reaction has been widely applied to prepare metal-conjugates with biologically relevant moieties, as the RuII polypyridyl complex is stable under physiological conditions and, thus, prevents concomitant poisoning or undesired degradation. Ruthenium dyes were used to covalently label peptides and proteins (entries 3–652,198–200 and 12–15)68,75,203–206,232–235 or DNA strands (entries 9–11), including non-covalent DNA intercalation.51,53,55,56,203 In addition, energy and electron transfer processes are investigated to study the internal structure and the associated changes upon target binding, e.g., for peptide sequences67 or DNA strands (entry 9 and Fig. 8).51 In addition, biological process can be visualized by Ru-conjugates, e.g., the circulation within the blood system (entry 13),204 or incorporation pathways of peptides into cells (entries 16–18).63,64,66 Throughout these reports, similar amidation protocols were applied to prepare the conjugates; hence, representative examples providing details will be discussed. Gui et al. synthesized an aptasensor for the ultrasensitive detection of thrombin via an in situ generated self-enhanced luminophore by lactamase catalysis for signal amplification.198 The synthesis was performed using 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (EDC) and N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) and the product solution was used without further purification. Oh et al. reported a peptide-based optical biosensor, which consists of a [Ru(bpy)2(phen)]2+ complex and an electron-accepting methyl viologen moiety that are bridged by a polypeptide spacer. The synthesis starts from the amidation of the amino-decorated Ru complex with iodoacetic anhydride, followed by nucleophilic substitution of the iodine by the thiol-groups present in the peptide. In the absence of a target antibody, photo-induced electron transfer occurs that quenches the Ru emission, whereupon binding of a target to the peptide leads to a more extended conformation, which translates to an increased energy transfer distance and, ultimately, to an enhanced Ru emission. The authors emphasized the recognition capability of the peptide, in order to form a robust optical sensor for HIV-antibodies.200 Sadhu et al. reported the coupling of an isothiocyanate-decorated [Ru(bpy)2(phen)]2+ complex to the amino-terminus of a lysine–PEG–ligand conjugate, where “ligand” denotes a biologically relevant targeting function (biotin, glucose, etc.) (Fig. 8).67 An oligomeric receptor protein was used to bind simultaneously the Ru-decorated conjugate and a rhodamine dye with the same targeting function, which leads to a photo-reductive release of the rhodamine dye upon excitation of the Ru unit. Note that the preparation of the isothiocyanate-decorated Ru complex likely follows the related in situ activation via thiophosgene from the corresponding amino-decorated Ru congener,236 although no reference was provided by Sadhu et al.67

Anion recognition and self-assembly. 
The Beer group (Table 1, entries 1 and 2)196,197 utilized amidation reactions to construct chiral receptors for anion recognition.167,168 In their first report, the twofold decoration of bis-carboxy bpy with the free amino group of chiral tert-butoxycarbonyl-R,R-1,2-diaminocyclohexane resulted in the corresponding ligand N^N, but complexation to form the [Ru(bpy)2(N^N)]2+ complexes leads only to intractable mixtures. Alternatively, the related “chemistry-on-the-complex” approach gave the desired complex in 64% yield, which was separated into the corresponding Δ/Λ enantiomers by chiral ion exchange chromatography (Section 7.1.5). However, the enantioselective recognition of chiral carboxylates via the bis-amide pincer moiety was not successful. Based on this amide linkage, the group reported later related [Ru(bpy)2(N^N)]2+ complexes bearing an alkyl-spaced imidazole, which was subsequently quaternized with MeI. The obtained complexes were studied in mixed organic–aqueous solutions via luminescence spectroscopy to detect chlorides, bromides, and biologically relevant anions dihydrogen phosphate and ATP. The Williams group utilized the amide linkage to attach free bpy units to the [Ru(bpy)2(N^N)]2+ core, which serves for the subsequent cation complexation of Cu2+ and Zn2+ (entry 8).202 The amidation reactions were performed using 1-hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBt), O-(benzotriazole-1-yl)-N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (HBTU) and diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA) in dichloromethane with good isolated yields (49 and 83%, respectively). As a result of the cation's multivalency, self-assembled structures can form, which are assigned to the observed Ru emission quenching.
Ru–Polymer architectures. 
The amidation reaction has also been applied to incorporate RuII polypyridyl-type complexes into polymers. The conceptional approach shares similarities with the synthesis of star-shaped complexes and Ru-containing macrocycles (Section 5.1), and can be extended to polymers with various linkages (Section 5.7). One strategy relies on Ru-containing monomers and the subsequent polymerization. For example, Chen et al. (Table 1, entry 19) reported the amidation of an NHS-activated carboxyl-decorated [Ru(bpy)3]2+ complex to introduce a ring-strained polymerizable group in good yield (74%).207 The ring opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) was achieved using a Grubbs-type ruthenium alkylidene initiator to achieve high conversions (90%). The second example published by Lu reports monomer synthesis via amidation of a bis-carboxyl-decorated [Ru(bpy)3]2+ complex by one or two equivalents of aminomethyl styrene, depending on stoichiometry (entry 20).208 The subsequent free radical copolymerization with aminomethyl styrene was initiated by azo-bis(isobutyronitrile) (AIBN) generated electroactive chemiluminescent sensors. However, the practical versatility of the polymerization technique to prepare defined homo- and copolymers greatly depends on the absence of deleterious termination reactions with the growing chains with the Ru complexes, which may explain the inferior role of this approach.
The complementary strategy to prepare Ru–polymer architectures relies on the multiple amidation of a polymer chain by Ru units in a polymer-analogous fashion. This approach benefits from optimized polymerization techniques for a given monomer to control the degree of polymerization, dispersity and functional group fidelity. Borg et al. reported the direct amidation of a pentafluorophenyl-activated polyacrylic acid (PAA) block using the peripheral amino-group of a [Ru(tpy)2]2+-based complex (entry 21).209 The Tew group detailed the EDC and HOBT mediated amidation to introduce [Ru(tpy)2]2+-based complexes into the polyacrylic acid block, reaching high yields of functionalization of up to 95% according to 1H NMR and FT-IR analysis (entry 22).210 The Meyer group reported various examples of the side-chain amidation of an aminoalkyl-functionalized polystyrene with a carboxyl-decorated [Ru(bpy)3]2+ complex (entry 23)211,237 as well as the complementary NHS-functionalized polystyrene,238 including a vinyl-equipped Ru complex designed for subsequent crosslinking through electropolymerization to yield photoredox-active metallopolymeric films on the surface of an electrode (entry 24).212
Ru–Metal assemblies. 
The amidation reaction has been utilized by many groups to connect RuII polypyridyl-type complexes with various functional metal complexes (Table 1, entries 25–33), designed for phototherapeutic or photocatalytic purposes, or to study fundamental energy and electron transfer processes.50,213–222,225,230,239–241 The Barton group extended their work on Ru–peptide conjugates to attach an electron-accepting pentaammine ruthenium(III) complex via a peptide linker to the DNA-intercalating [Ru(bpy)2(dppz)]2+ chromophore unit (entry 27). After light-induced charge transfer, the intercalated RuIII led to oxidative DNA damage.50 The Sakai group reported the direct amide linkage of an amino-decorated [Ru(bpy)(phen)]2+ with a diester-functionalized bpy, which was subsequently complexed by Pt for light-induced hydrogen production from water. The Meyer group coupled a [Ru(bpy)3]2+-based chromophore to a [Ru(tpy)(bpy)(H2O)]2+ fragment for catalytic water oxidation, including immobilization onto TiO2 for a photo-electrochemical cell.214,215
The Heinze group advanced the application of the solid-phase synthesis of metallo-amino acids (Fig. 9),242,243i.e., to utilize carboxyl-decorated [Ru(bpy)3]2+ and amino-decorated [Ru(bpy)2(phen)]2+ (entry 38),225 as well as carboxyl- and/or amino-equipped [Ru(tpy)2]2+-complexes (entry 31).216,219 The amide linkage was used to attach bpy units for subsequent coordination to Re(CO3)Cl or PtCl2 fragments, as well as ferrocene units or a second [Ru(tpy)2]2+ unit to study fundamental energy and electron transfer processes. In the latter case, the synthesis of dinuclear metallo-amino acid complexes required the selective protection of the functional group to be inert during coupling, in order to prevent polymerization.219

Since 2000, the groups of Åkermark, Sun, Hammarström and Styring formed a “Swedish consortium” to combine their research interest in mimicking proton-coupled electron transfer and photosynthetic water splitting. The prepared architectures were composed of a [Ru(bpy)3]2+-based sensitizer coupled to various polydentate ligand scaffolds that are designated to complex Mn ions, which can undergo accumulative electron transfer steps upon multiple Ru excitation events (Fig. 10). The sophisticated structure required a robust linkage strategy on the complex, in order to avoid undesired coordination in a hypothetical preassembled ligand platform.245 The linkage to a CuIII-corrole moiety was accomplished by a similar SOCl2-promoted activation of the carboxy-decorated [Ru(bpy)3]2+ fragment to the corresponding acid chloride, followed by reaction with the cuprated aminophenyl-equipped corrole in the presence of NEt3 in 63% yield.244 The amide linkage further served to assemble trinuclear arrays containing a central lanthanide complex (Nd, Er, Yb; see Fig. 11a) with two peripheral [Ru(bpy)3]2+ chromophores, which sensitize the NIR emission of the lanthanides by energy transfer from the Ru centers (entry 33).222 The amidation was further applied to connect organic chromophores, e.g., carotenoids (entry 34)158 or coumarin dyes for energy transfer (entry 35),158,223 as well as redox-active phenothiazine, methyl viologen units or catalytically active sites (Fig. 11b).229

Additional examples have been reported on the wide application of amidation to achieve biochemical activity, electroluminescence and self-assembly.246–252
Miscellaneous immobilization. 
The amidation of Ru complexes was also reported to introduce reactive moieties for surface immobilization, which will be exemplified for silica, gold-coated silicon and partially oxidized carbon nanotubes. First, the EDC-mediated coupling of aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APS) with the three peripheral carboxyl-groups of a [Ru(phen)3]2+-type complex (Table 1, entry 36) was performed, so that introduced APS moiety can be utilized for covalent incorporated into silica nanoparticles upon copolymerization with tetraethoxysilane applying the water–oil microemulsion technique.224 The inverse strategy of covalently modifying a silica particle with a Ru complex has also been reported. In that case, the silica surface was first functionalized with polyamines and subsequently subjected to the HBTU/DIPEA-promoted amide coupling of a bis-carboxyl-decorated bipyridine Ru complex.236 Alternatively, the authors investigated the in situ activation of an amino-decorated phenanthroline Ru complex with thiophosgene, which yielded the corresponding thiocarbamate linkage to the polyamine surface. Secondly, the surface immobilization of gold-coated silicon chips was reported, using the ring opening of a dithiolane moiety equipped with an NHS-ester.253 The [Ru(bpy)3]2+-type complex was attached via a peripheral amino-group promoted by EDC/NEt3. Thirdly, the modification of partially oxidized carbon nanotubes was reported (see Fig. 11c and Table 1, entry 7),254 whereby the surface carboxyl groups were converted into their acid chloride and subsequently reacted in DMF with a bis-aminobenzyl-decorated [Ru(tpy)2]2+ complex in the presence of NEt3. The former two examples demonstrated the utility of the “chemistry-on-the-complex” via amidation to introduce reactive silanols, ethers or cyclic disulfide, which are prone to hydrolysis or cleavage under the typical reaction conditions of the alternative coordination of the corresponding ligands.


5.2.2. Esterfication. 
The esterification reaction is closely related to the amidation reaction, whereby the amino group is formally replaced by a hydroxyl group in the corresponding substrates. The same coupling reagents known from the amidation reactions (Fig. 7b) were applied for the esterification reaction, e.g., HBTU, HATU or DCC.52 However, in many cases the ester linkage serves only to cap the carboxyl-decorated ruthenium complexes by simple alcohols rather than append a functional moiety, which is preferentially achieved via amidation. In comparison to the amide linkage, the ester group is generally more prone to hydrolysis, which manifests the preferred use as a protecting group. Notably, esterification leads to an increased solubility with respect to the free acid groups of the complexes.
The most prominent use of esterification employs hydroxymethyl-decorated Ru complexes. For example, the ring-opening polymerization of caprolactone has been reported to be initiated by a hydroxymethyl-decorated [Ru(dqp)2]2+ complex, leading to the chain-end functionalized polymer.256 An elegant example of esterification is based on succinimide anhydride to assemble dinuclear complexes (Fig. 13).255 First, a threefold hydroxymethyl-decorated [Ru(bpy)3]2+ complex is esterified with succinic anhydride, which releases carboxyl groups that are afterwards employed in esterification using HBTU in 71% yield. The three introduced bpy ligands are pre-destined for the coordination of FeII to self-assemble into a heterometallic triple-stranded helicate. Likewise, a series of trimeric, pentameric and heptameric Ru metallo-dendrimers were reported starting from the corresponding two-, tetra-, and sixfold hydroxymethyl-decorated [Ru(bpy)3]2+ core, which were esterified via DCC and DMAP with bipyridine carboxylic acid (Fig. 12, left).186 Afterwards, different peripheral ruthenium intermediates bearing bpy- or phen-based ligands were coordinated.

 Fig. 13  Schematic representation of a twofold esterification starting from hydroxymethyl-decorated [Ru(bpy)3]2+ by Fletcher and coworkers to prepare a triple-stranded [Ru–Fe] helix.255 
Alternatively, the opposite ester linkage (Fig. 12, right) was reported, employing a phenol-decorated [Ru(tpy)2]2+ complexes, which were coupled with dithiolane-equipped aliphatic acids by DCC/DMAP activation with a yield of up to 78%.62 The sulfur groups were subsequently used for immobilization onto Au surfaces, in order to screen the catalytic oxidation of triphenylphosphine or antibacterial activity.
Notably, the ester linkage can also be formed by alkylation of the carboxylate. The Ma group utilized the alkylation of bis-carboxyl-decorated [Ru(bpy)3]2+ with bromoalkanes that bear one or two carbazole units, respectively, in reasonable yields (41%, Fig. 12, right).257 The Ru–oligocarbazole complexes were deposited by electrochemical coupling of the peripheral carbazole units for use in organic light emitting diodes. Note that only weak bases (NaHCO3) are required for deprotonation of the carboxyl group. Another application is the immobilization of carboxyl-decorated [Ru(bpy)3]2+ onto Sephadex for the photo-induced production of singlet oxygen.258,259 The essential linkage was achieved after reacting epichlorohydrin with the Sephadex resin, which subsequently permits the ring-opening with the carboxyl groups of the Ru complex.

5.3. Miscellaneous reactions
Miscellaneous acylation reactions were utilized for the formation of new peripheral ligand platforms on Ru complexes. For example, two twofold Mannich-type reactions were reported for both ortho-positions in a tyrosine-modified [Ru(bpy)3]2+ complex, i.e., using formaldehyde and dipicolylamine under reductive conditions (Fig. 14a).260,261 The generated chelating motif was subsequently used to assemble [Ru–Mn2] heterometallic dyads as depicted previously in Fig. 10. Karlsson et al. reported the conversion of [Ru(bpy)3]2+-based complexes bearing a peripheral dicarboxyphenol moiety, whereby the acid groups were first activated towards amidation and subsequently reacted with ortho-diaminophenol.262 As a result, the formal amide intermediate undergoes cyclization to yield the corresponding benzimidazole units (Fig. 14b). After complexation to MnII ions, the capability towards catalytic water oxidation was investigated, in line with the long-standing research interest of the authors as discussed for the [Ru–Mn] assemblies featuring alternative linkage patterns and ligand scaffolds. A related condensation reaction was reported by the Aukauloo group using diamino-decorated tpy with a diketo-functionalized Ru complex (Fig. 14c) to form the bridging imidazole unit.263 Descending from seminal work in the 1990s,264 the Rau group reported the related pyrazine ring formation starting from functionalized Ru complexes bearing the diketo-265 or the diamino-synthon (Fig. 14d and e).266 These selected examples demonstrate the broader scope of acylation reactions for heterocyclic ring forming reactions, which can be utilized to decorate the Ru sensitizer units with coordination sites for other metals, e.g., aiming at molecular photocatalysis.

5.4. Alkylation reactions
In the previous section, the formation of amide and ester linkages was detailed that preferentially proceeds via acylation of amino or hydroxyl groups by activated esters. Notably, ester linkages were also occasionally generated from the carboxylate via O-alkylation of the deprotonated form. More importantly, alkylation reactions can be utilized for conjugation to suitable O-, N-, and S-nucleophiles, descending preferentially from phenols, tertiary amines or pyridines, or thiols, respectively. Popular alkylating reagents comprise alkyl halides or benzyl halides (Cl, Br) as well as the corresponding Ru-containing congeners for nucleophilic substitution reactions, whereas pentafluorophenyl (PhF5) groups can be utilized for nucleophilic aromatic substitution reactions. In general, weak-to-moderate bases are applied, e.g., K2CO3, Na2CO3, Cs2CO3, sodium or trimethylamine. Fig. 15 depicts the principle combinations of C–O, C–N, or C–S linkages that are formed from the complementary substitution pattern (left vs. right side). Representative examples will be provided in the following paragraphs, while Table 2 summarizes reported examples for O-alkylation (entries 1–17), N-alkylation (entries 18–22), S-alkylation (entries 23–30), and miscellaneous C- and P-nucleophiles (entries 31 and 32).

5.4.1. 
            O-Alkylation. 

O-Alkylation of phenolic hydroxyl groups represents the most frequently used method to date in order to link Ru complexes to additional functional moieties. Although the list is not intended to be exhaustive, comprehensive examples for the amidation reaction will be discussed, aiming at, e.g., electron and energy-transfer processes, surface immobilization, or introduction of new functional groups.
Multinuclear polypyridyl-type complexes. 
Among the first, the Juris group reported in 2000 the alkylation of bromine-decorated [Ru(bpy)3]2+ complexes with hydroxyl-equipped bpy promoted by K2CO3 in anhydrous MeCN.180 Afterwards, the coordination was performed to generate the peripheral [M(bpy)3]2+ complexes (M = Ru, Os) (Table 2, entry 1). In contrast to earlier more strongly coupled polynuclear assemblies,179 the photophysical properties of the subunits were mainly preserved, which initiated great interest in the following years. The Constable group systematically investigated the synthesis of polynuclear metal complexes via O-alkylation chemistry (entries 2–4).159,182,267,268 The linkage was achieved using Cl-decorated [Ru(tpy)2]2+ and aromatic alcohols (phenol, 1,3-dihydroxybenzene) as the O-nucleophiles, which enabled the attachment of bpy,182 tpy or even pre-assembled [Ru(tpy)2]2+ fragments (Fig. 16).267,268 Interestingly, the linkage of hydroxyl-decorated bpy or tpy with [Ru(tpy)2]2+ complexes bearing peripheral benzyl bromide groups was reported to be problematic and led to undesired acetylation, likely originating from MeCN as the solvent.159
 Fig. 16  Schematic representation of selected examples for polynuclear complexes via O-alkylation chemistry from the Constable group: (a) coupling of a bis-phenol-decorated bpy ligand182 and (b) coupling of a 1,3-dihydroxy-decorated metal complex.268 
Donor–acceptor assemblies. 
The alkylation strategy was further applied to assemble molecular dyads, triads, etc., to study photoinduced energy and electron transfer processes. Although the majority of such sophisticated architectures contain conjugated aromatic linkage patterns and are often assembled prior to coordination, the use of alkylation is reported. For example, free or Zn-containing porphyrins were coupled to bis-phenol-decorated [Ru(tpy)2]2+ to form the symmetric trinuclear system with a yield of 73% (Table 2, entry 9).271 Notably, isolation of the mono-functionalized intermediate enabled the synthesis of the asymmetric [H2-porphyrin]–[Ru]–[Zn-porphyrin] triads by a second Williamson ether synthesis step.
In a series of recent reports, the selective chain-end modification for the modular assembly of polymer-based dyads and triads via O-alkylation was detailed (Fig. 17).272,273,275–277 The “chemistry-on-the-complex” approach started from a hydroxy-decorated [Ru(dqp2)]2+ complex, which was functionalized with a variety of benzylchloride-decorated poly(triarylamine)s or poly(naphthalene diimide)s using K2CO3/KI in DMF (entries 10–15). Notably, the tolerated TIPS-protected alkyne group was liberated afterwards to allow the copper-mediated azide–alkyne cycloaddition reaction (see Section 5.6 for more details), i.e., to attach the complementary redox-active chain. These architectures featured an efficient directional photo-induced charge separation of the modularly electronically-decoupled building blocks. The complementary linkage was reported for a bromomethyl-decorated [Ru(bpy)3]2+ sensitizer with a hydroxyl-pyridine motif in 70% yield (entries 1 and 8). In this way, a multidentate pyridine scaffold was introduced and subsequently metalated with MnII to mimic elementary photoinduced charge accumulation.180,270

Reactive peripheral groups. 
The Constable group extended their methodology established for polynuclear complexes to introduce reactive peripheral groups. Propargyl bromide was reacted with phenol-decorated [Ru(bpy)3]2+ complexes (Table 2, entry 7) to introduce two or six terminal alkyne groups in 89% and 42% yield, respectively. More importantly, these units provide access to the subsequent copper-mediated azide–alkyne cycloaddition reactions (see Section 5.6 for more details), as demonstrated for azide-containing sugars (Fig. 18a). Among others, the Siegel group employed a similar strategy to introduce reactive peripheral groups for catenane formation,278,285e.g., reacting various phenol-decorated RuII polypyridyl-type complexes with α,ω-substituted linkers that carry the required bromo group on one side and an alkene or alkyne moieties on the other side (Fig. 18b, entry 16).278 Subsequently, Grubbs-type olefin metathesis or Glaser-type alkyne-coupling was used to form inter- and intra-bridged catenanes. Note that all four catenanes descend from the same Ru complex, illustrating its use as a building block in a modular fashion via “chemistry-on-the-complex”. Another recent example of introducing an alkyl-spaced terminal alkene was published, although no further use was reported (Table 2, entry 6).54 These three examples demonstrate the potential of the alkylation strategy to augment Ru complexes with various reaction functional groups, designated for subsequent chemical reactions or surface immobilization.

The Yuan group introduced different functionalized nitrophenols for the detection of HOCl, nitric oxide or thiophenol in living cells (Fig. 19).70,71 These three types of sensing were verified by the changes in the fluorescence of the different species, which are induced by the addition of NO (Fig. 19a) or cleavage reactions that are triggered by the analyte molecules (Fig. 19b and c).

5.4.2. 
            N-Alkylation. 
The nucleophilic substitution reaction can also be used for C–N bond formation. For this purpose, alkyl amines as well as aromatic amines are required. In the early stage of preparing heterometallic [Ru–Mn] complexes to explore multi-electron storage in an artificial photosystem, the benzylbromide group was utilized to connect a dipicolylamine (Fig. 20).270 In this case, the coupling of two Ru complexes was achieved via the secondary amino group; notably, the peripheral dangling pyridines were tolerated (entry 18). Likewise, an amino-decorated [Ru] complex was alkylated by a benzylbromide derivative, which was later transformed into a molybdenum-based oxotransferase model compound.286
 Fig. 20  Schematic representation of a selected example for C–N linkage using nucleophilic substitution with secondary amines.270 
Under more forcing reaction conditions, the reaction of a benzylic halide with a pyridine can be utilized as an effective strategy to link Ru complexes with a functional molecular fragment, which introduces an additional positive charge by the pyridinium linkage (Fig. 21). This linkage motif was used for the chain end functionalization of a poly(naphthalene diimide) acceptor (entry 19)272 as well as for the incorporation of dipicolylamine to complex manganese.270 The Zhong group functionalized a bis-vinyl-decorated [Ru(tpy)2]2+ complex with dipicolylamine (entry 20).280 The obtained ruthenium complexes were copolymerized to form redox active films. In this regard, the dipicolylamine functionality was utilized for the detection of Cu2+ ions. A similar strategy was used to introduce anchor units onto a hexameric ruthenium complex (Fig. 21a and Table 2, entry 22).281 Therefore, the carboxylic acid groups can be bonded directly to the pyridine units, while the phosphonate groups were bonded in two steps. In the first step dibromopropane was substituted by the pyridine unit, which can be functionalized in the second step with triethylphosphite. All reactions were realized in a high pressure reactor without a base. The Ward group reported the related alkylation of pyrazoles, in order to introduce free binding sites to construct mixed-metal self-assemblies.120,121 Recently, the alkylation of an amino-functionalized [Ru(bpy)2(phen)]2+ core using a phosphonium-activated peptide was reported by the Rau and Weil group, leading to mitochondria targeted protein for photodynamic application.287
 Fig. 21  Schematic representation of selected examples for C–N linkage using pyridinium formation, e.g., (a) for hexa-functionalization, (b) for methyl viologen introduction into light-harvesting Ru polymer,238 and (c) for chain-end modification of a redox-active polymer with a single Ru sensitizer aiming at charge percolation pathways.272 
Note that the pyridinium linkage strategy is widely used to generate a viologen unit, i.e., to react various alkylhalide-functionalized Ru complexes with mono-alkylated 4,4′-bipyridine (methyl viologen, Fig. 21b). Notably, the reaction conditions are comparable to those for pyridinium linkages, and have been applied to Br-terminated polymers obtained from ATRP.238,288 In this architecture, the “linkage” reaction forms an electron acceptor for photo-induced electron transfer processes, which was shown to utilize the light harvesting of the polymetallic Ru polymer for the final charge separation with the methyl viologen. A similar reaction type was used to connect a single Ru complex to the chain end of a poly(naphthalene diimide) (Fig. 21c),272 which resulted in highly efficient charge separation aiming towards charge percolation along the backbone (see also Fig. 19).


5.4.3. 
            S-Alkylation. 
The substitution reactions of halogen compounds by sulfur nucleophiles can be used for the introduction of thiol groups or the formation of thioethers (Fig. 22 and Table 2, entries 24 and 25).279 In contrast to O-congeners, sodium salts can be directly applied. Wild et al. coupled [Ru(tpy)2]2+-based complexes bearing two pentafluorophenyl units (see Fig. 22 and Table 2, entries 26 and 27) to form metallopolymers.282 In addition, the para-positioned fluorine can be readily converted by a thiol that bears a conjugated spacer unit and a terminal free tpy unit. Afterwards, the coordination polymerization with FeII ions was used to prepare heterometallic coordination polymers. The Yuan group used sulfides for nucleophilic substitution, in order to couple a nitrophenyl compound which serves as a detector for hypochlorite in living cells, as described previously.69 Early examples for C–S couplings are presented by the Tor group, who reported the nucleophilic substitution of the reactive meta-position in a Br-decorated [Ru(bpy)3]2+-type complex with thiolate nucleophiles, including a tert-butyloxycarbonyl (BOC)-protected terminal amino functionality.283,284 Remarkably, this reaction can be extended to pre-formed C-nucleophiles (fluorenyl anions, entry 31). Notably, the formation of the C–P bond was achieved using triethyl phosphite (entry 32).281

5.5. Metal-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions
Palladium-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions represent a powerful tool in synthetic chemistry with a broad range of substrates as well as application fields. The conventional catalytic cycle involves an active Pd0 catalyst, which is prone to deleterious deactivation by residual oxygen. Notably, RuII polypyridyl-based complexes generally do not act as oxidants and, thus, enable the application of cross-coupling reactions. In this regard, Ru complexes bearing the desired halide group directly on the ligand scaffold can be used both for nucleophilic substitution reactions and for cross-coupling reactions, whereas the majority of the utilized halide-functionalized Ru complexes involve an organic spacing unit (e.g., phenyl). Note that these Ar–X groups are readily introduced during the Kröhnke- or Skraup-type ligand synthesis. The importance of cross-coupling reactions further stems from the electronic communication across the conjugated linkage, so that many of the subsequent examples explore the fundamental effect of the bridge on the photophysical properties. Another beneficial geometrical feature originates from the axial symmetry, which restricts the possible conformations and, thus, facilitates the analysis of the photophysical data as well as the construction of sophisticated supramolecular architectures.

5.5.1. Sonogashira coupling. 
Sonogashira cross-coupling represents the most frequently applied methodology to connect Ru complexes with various metal-containing fragments (Table 3, entries 1–14)127,148,289–304 or other functional organic moieties (Table 3, entries 15–28).35,144,185,188,189,305–328 Notably, both complementary substrate combinations are reported, i.e., the Sonogashira coupling of alkyne- or halide-functionalized Ru complexes, respectively, in good to excellent yields using typical catalyst systems composed of CuI and Pd–phosphine complexes, e.g., Pd(PPh3)4, Pd(PPh3)2Cl2, Pd(dppf)Cl2, and Pd2(dba)3 (where PPh3 is triphenylphosphine, dppf is 1,1′-bis(diphenylphosphino)ferrocene, and dba is dibenzylideneacetone). The solvents and bases to scavenge the formed HX have to be selected according to the solubility of the complexes, and range from DMF, THF, and MeCN to benzene with bases like piperidine, diisopropylamine, triethylamine and Hünig's base. Also, microwave-assisted protocols were reported that led to decreased reaction times. Table 3 provides a comprehensive overview of the reported Ru complexes, as well as the reagents used, the synthesis conditions and the yields.

The Ziessel group showed the versatility of Sonogashira coupling for the “chemistry-on-the-complex” methodology. For example, the Sonogashira reaction was applied to attach a pyrene unit after complexation, while the classical formation via ligand functionalization and subsequent coordination failed. The broad scope of the reaction was demonstrated for [Ru(bpy)3]2+, [Ru(phen)3]2+ and [Ru(tpy)2]2+ complexes containing multiple bromo functionalities in the meta-positions of the external pyridine units. The typical reaction conditions involve Pd(PPh3)4 as pre-catalyst, isopropylamine as base and a MeCN/benzene solvent mixture at 60 °C, leading to moderate-to-high yields of up to 95% (Fig. 23 and Table 3, entry 21).310,311,321,322
 Fig. 23  Schematic representation of pyrene functionalized ruthenium–phenanthroline complexes via Sonogashira cross-coupling. 
Sonogashira cross-coupling represents a versatile methodology to connect RuII polypyridyl-type complexes with redox-active moieties, e.g., to form dyads, triads and beyond. The synthetic pathways varied from a stepwise protocol to parallelized variants depending on the symmetry of the desired architectures and, thus, the employed RuII complexes. For example, a triad composed of the subunits [Ru(tpy)2]2+, zinc porphyrin and [Os(tpy)2]2+ was synthesized by the stepwise conjugation of the RuII fragment with the zinc porphyrin (79%) to form the corresponding dyad, which was subsequently linked by an analogous coupling to the [Os(tpy)2]2+-fragment in 23% yield (Table 3, entry 2).289 Likewise, a related triad was assembled stepwise from two different zinc porphyrins, which were conjugated with the [Ru(tpy)2]2+ unit in the final step.295 A [Ru(tpy)2]2+-based core was decorated with up to four zinc porphyrin units as reported by Ishizuka et al. (entry 12).301 The coupling of the zinc porphyrins occurred in one synthetic step on a multi-functionalized ruthenium complex with a remarkable yield of up to 90%. Combined techniques between coupling and coordination are also published and described by the Schmittel group (Table 3, entry 3)290 as well as the Mayer group (entry 6).296 Recently, additional Ru conjugates with Zn porphyrins with non-linear optical properties330 as well as dual phosphorescent Ru-bodipy architectures were reported aiming at triplet–triplet upconversion for photodynamic therapy applications.331
Matt et al. synthesized a polyoxometalate (POM), which was decorated with two ruthenium complexes coupled via the Sonogashira reaction (Table 3, entry 1).148 While no electron transfer was observed in the case of the binary mixture of the complex and the polyoxametalates, the covalent linkage between both units led to electron transfer. Various tungsten POMs bearing peripheral iodo-aryl moieties were synthesized, which were coupled in good yields (76–86%) to cyclometalated Ru complexes bearing acetylene functionalities on the carbanionic fragment.
A direct comparison of the scope of the Sonogashira cross-coupling reaction and the related Suzuki coupling was investigated by Vrabel et al. (Table 3, entry 23)313,314 and Yang et al. (Table 3, entry 22).312 Vrabel et al. coupled deoxyadenosine nucleosides via both reaction techniques to a series of free ligands as well as the corresponding Ru complexes based on bpy, phen and tpy (Fig. 24). Notably, the Suzuki reactions achieved for all studied examples better results than the Sonogashira coupling reactions. The same observation was found by Yang et al., albeit less pronounced. While bis-3,5-dibromophenyl-decorated [Ru(tpy)2]2+ complexes gave the tetra-substituted Suzuki product using pyridine boronic ester in remarkably high yield (85%), the corresponding Sonogashira coupling using acetylenic pyridine gave a slightly lower yield of 78% (Fig. 25). Although the reported yields were comparable, the Sonogashira reaction seems to lead in all cases to a somewhat lower yield than the related Suzuki reaction.

 Fig. 25  Schematic representation of the synthesis of a [Ru(tpy)2]2+-based complex with four peripheral pyridine units via Sonogashira cross-coupling (left) and Suzuki cross-coupling (right).312 


5.5.2. Suzuki coupling. 
Suzuki coupling also represents a versatile and wide-spread method to connect two aromatic subunits. In contrast to the Sonogashira version, two aryl units are linked directly, i.e., without an intervening alkyne. The range of reported Ru-containing substrates for Suzuki cross-coupling, i.e., the corresponding halides and boronic acid derivatives, is comparable to the Sonogashira cross-coupling reaction – but not used as extensively. Table 4 lists the reported examples for the couplings of RuII polypyridyl-type complexes with metal-containing substrates (entries 1–4),124,133,149,312,332–336 or with organic substrates (entries 5–16),145–147,313,314,337–349 including the assembly of photoactive dyads and triads. In close resemblance to related Pd-mediated cross-couplings, the catalytic systems are composed of commercially available pre-catalysts, e.g., Pd(PPh3)4, Pd(PPh3)2Cl2, Pd(dppf)Cl2, and Pd(dba)2 with assisting phosphine ligands, e.g., Buchwald's SPHOS, bidentate dppf or the water-soluble PPh3-derived ligand triphenylphosphine-3,3′,3′′-trisulfonic acid trisodium salt (TTPPT). Brunner et al. reported the use of a dendronized Pd-G2 SPHOS catalyst system, which promotes the coupling of functionalized benzene boronic esters bearing phosphonic acid or carboxylic acid groups with a yield of up to 84% (entry 15).350 Polar solvent mixtures and bases, i.e., ranging from DMSO, DME/EtOH, MeCN/H2O, DMF, and THF/H2O to Na2CO3, K2CO3, K3PO4, and Cs2CO3, respectively, are typically employed for Suzuki cross-coupling.

The groups of Hanan, Juris and Campagna investigated the Suzuki coupling reaction of functionalized [Ru(tpy)2]2+ complexes bearing one or two peripheral chloropyrimidine units attached to the axial 4′-position(s) (Fig. 26 and Table 4, entries 9 and 10).339 The coupling with anthracene boronic acid was improved by using an excess of the reagents, leading to the mono- and bis-functionalized products. The Pd(PPh3)4 catalyst achieved the highest yield for the mono-functionalized product, which was dimerized via the remaining Cl group using Pd(OAc)2 as catalyst to afford the dinuclear Ru complex (Fig. 26, right). On the other hand, the use of Pd(PPh3)2Cl2 and an excess of boronic acid furnished the full conversion to the doubly anthracenyl-equipped complex.
 Fig. 26  Schematic representation of the functionalization of [Ru(tpy)2]2+-based complexes with anthracene: (left) twofold decoration and (right) onefold decoration with subsequent reductive dimerization.339 
The groups of Williams and Hanan extended the Suzuki coupling protocol to various aryls (e.g., tolyl, anthracenyl, nitrophenyl or dimethylarylamine units133,343) using Pd(PPh3)4 and sodium carbonate in DME/EtOH to obtain good yields around 60%. Notably, the trimethylsilyl (TMS) group was reported (Table 4, entry 14),349 which was converted by ICl to the corresponding iodo-aryl derivative to serve in a subsequent Suzuki coupling step. Additional functional groups include phenyl or triarylamino moieties bearing carboxylic acid groups for surface immobilization,145–147,344 as well as electropolymerizable thiophene or bithiophene units using Pd(dba)2/SPHOS (Table 4, entry 12).347,353 The Berlinguette group reported the synthetic route towards a cyclometalated [Ru(tpy)(N^N^C)]+ complex for photovoltaic applications, whereby the metallating ligand contained a thiophene group as well as a triarylamine unit, while the anchoring tpy ligand bears the carboxyester groups (Table 4, entry 11).341,342 Since the coordination of the carboxy-decorated ligand failed, the complementary “chemistry-on-the-complex” strategy was followed to obtain the desired complex after introduction of the triarylamine unit into the thiophene with a remarkable yield of 85%.
The coupling of two or more complexes containing ruthenium, osmium or iridium centers can also be realized. There are numerous examples of directly coupled dinuclear complexes via an oligophenyl spacer (Table 4, entries 2 and 3).124,133,333,334,345 A systematic series by DeCola, Indelli and Scandola addressed the dependence of the photophysical processes using various conjugated bridges composed of phenyl and fluorenyl units,335 including alkyl substituents to promote solubility as well as a dihedral twist of the aromatic bridge units.336 The Abruña group reported various dinuclear Ru and Os complexes towards molecular electronic applications, which bear a dithienylcyclopentene-bridge that can be isomerized to control the degree of electronic communication.332 Strongly-coupled dinuclear [Ru–Os] complexes featuring a linkage via the less frequently used meta-position pattern were also synthesized following the Suzuki coupling methodology.348 Various dinuclear [Ru–Pd] complexes were synthesized via Suzuki coupling to study their photochemical reactivity, e.g., towards styrenes.346 The Newkome group reported multinuclear complexes to explore fundamental self-assembly in supramolecular architectures (Section 5.1),337 including related work by others on 2D and 3D supramolecular architectures.354,355 Notably, the Suzuki reaction can also be performed for extended reaction times (up to 10 days) and/or at room temperature, giving good to excellent yields (Table 4, entry 17).352


5.5.3. Stille coupling. 
Stille cross-coupling represents a particularly attractive methodology to connect aryl groups. Due to the absence of an auxiliary base, the associated side reactions are diminished in comparison to the Suzuki protocol (e.g., deborylation). However, these merits are paralleled by the inherent toxicity of the stannyl compounds, which may account for the lower use of this versatile subclass of C–C bond formation reactions. There are just a few reports for bpy- and typ-based Ru complexes with boron-dipyrromethene (bodipy) or zinc porphyrins using Pd(dppf)Cl2 as catalyst in combination with CuI and trimethylamine.356 Note that the related Suzuki coupling would require an aqueous base, which is undesirable in view of the known base-sensitivity of the bodipy unit. Another example is reported by Steen et al., who reported the coupling of a thiophenebromide-functionalized [Ru(bpy)3]2+ complex with a bpy-thienyl stannane by applying the standard catalyst Pd(PPh3)4.357 Trouillet et al. reported the copolymerization of dibromo-equipped [Ru(bpy)3]2+ and a quaterthiophene bis-stannane bearing alkyl chains.358 Notably, the analogous incorporation of the free bpy ligand and subsequent coordination in the second step failed, demonstrating the versatility and necessity of the “chemistry-on-the-complex” to obtain the desired copolymer (Fig. 27). An isolated yield of up to 51% was reported, which required the preparation of the active catalyst Pd(PPh3)2 from Pd(PPh3)2Cl2 with an organo-lithium species before the polymerization.
 Fig. 27  Schematic representation of Stille cross-coupling forming a conjugated [Ru(bpy)3]2+-based metallopolymer with intervening thiophene units. 


5.5.4. Negishi coupling and Yamamoto-type homocoupling. 
In comparison to the Sonogashira and Suzuki cross-coupling reactions, the Negishi coupling using organo-zinc reagents has rarely been utilized. The Hanan group reported the Pd0-mediated coupling of 2-pyridyl zinc bromide with a 2-bromopyridyl-decorated [Ru(bpy)3]2+ to construct a new bpy unit for subsequent coordination using Pd(PPh3)4 as catalyst to reach 97% yield.359 Despite the excellent yield, the preparation and purification of organo-zinc compounds is more challenging than that of the related boron or tin reagents, which may explain their inferior role in synthetic chemistry. The direct coupling of halide-decorated Ru complexes was achieved in high yields (80–87%) using metallic zinc and Ni catalysts, e.g., NiCl2(H2O)6,360 Ni(PPh3)2Cl2,361 or Ni(PPh3)2Br2362,363 in the presence of PPh3 as a co-ligand (Fig. 28). Note that these examples represent a borderline case, depending on whether or not an organo-zinc compound is formed in situ. If not, homocoupling occurs via Yamamoto-type reductive dimerization, and the zinc is used to regenerate the active Ni0 species.
 Fig. 28  Schematic representation of the synthesis of dinuclear cyclometalated ruthenium complexes promoted by Zn-based reagents (Negishi reaction) or Zn-promoted reductive dimerization (Yamamoto coupling). 
Bhuiyan et al. synthesized a ruthenium phenanthroline dimer by coupling two with chloride functionalized complexes. The catalytic conditions are NiCl2 and PPh3 with elemental zinc to obtain the dimer in 55% yield.364 Furthermore, Yamamoto coupling is frequently applied to prepare polymers using bis-functionalized Ru complexes, which is beyond the scope of this review and only a brief introduction is included in Section 5.7. Interestingly, these conditions were found to be unsuitable for the homocoupling of a chloropyrimidyl-based Ru complex, which was alternatively dimerized using [Pd(OAc)2]/phosphine-mediated catalysis in 49% yield.339 Notably, no auxiliary reductant was added, which would be formally required under the reported conditions.

5.6. Azide–alkyne cycloaddition
The copper-mediated azide–alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) reaction has been extensively utilized during the last few years to couple different functionalities onto ruthenium complexes under mild conditions. For example, the introduction of anchor units (e.g., carboxylic acids or phosphonic acids), as previously discussed via alkylation or amidation reactions, can also be readily achieved via CuAAC.190,191 More importantly, the mild reaction conditions render this methodology particularly attractive in the case of sensitive functional moieties, e.g., bioconjugates. The Rau group recently reviewed in detail the “Click chemistry” for the synthesis of multiple luminescent ruthenium complexes.365,366 According to their classification, three main types can be distinguished, i.e., the “click to chelate”, “click then chelate” or “chelate then click” methodologies for various application fields, e.g., in DSSC devices, artificial photosynthetic catalysts, therapeutic applications and functionalization for bio-molecules (e.g., hormones, DNA250). The third technique termed “chelate than click” complements this review and will only be briefly discussed. The standard reaction conditions utilized CuIISO4·nH2O as the pre-catalyst that is reductively activated by sodium ascorbate (NaAsc) to generate active CuI species. A representative overview of selected examples is provided in Table 5, illustrating the wide range of functionalities from aryl groups (entry 1)367 to redox-active moieties (entry 2),368 Ni cyclam catalysts for the reduction of CO2 into CO or production of H2 (entry 3),369 amino acid derivatives (entry 4),370 photo-active tryptophan residues for radical generation (entry 5)371 or immobilization onto graphene sheets for photoactive materials (entry 6).372 Ascorbic acid instead of sodium ascorbate was used for the coupling with sugars (entry 7)74 or protein labeling. The sodium sulfonate groups on the ruthenium scaffold led to an increased solubility of the molecule (entry 8).232 Gerken et al. employed Cu(TBTA)SO4 (where TBTA is tris(benzyltriazolylmethyl)amine) and sodium ascorbate for the CuAAC reaction with tert-butylphenyl azide (entry 9).373

The CuAAC reaction can be performed in various aqueous organic solvents to ascertain the sufficient solubility of the sodium ascorbate or the ascorbic acid. A versatile non-aqueous catalytic system is based on CuBr in combination with N,N,N′,N′′,N′′-pentamethyldiethylenetriamine (PMDETA) as the stabilizing ligand (Fig. 29). In this case, a CuI source is used and, thus, no reduction by ascorbate under aqueous conditions is necessary. The CuAAC is widely applied for the incorporation of the ruthenium complexes into polymers in the side chain of polystyrene (Table 5, entry 11)374 and polypropylacrylate (see Fig. 29 and Table 5, entry 12)288 as well as for the chain-end functionalization of redox-active polymers (entry 10).272,275–277 Lee et al. reported the use of a halide-free [Cu(MeCN)4]+ catalyst for the microwave-assisted CuAAc reaction with proteins (entry 13).228 More examples and detailed discussion can be found in Rau's recent perspective on the scope of CuAAC for multifunctional luminescent ruthenium complexes,365 which will not be further detailed here.

5.7. Polymerization
The synthesis of metal-containing polymers or metallopolymers is highly promising to utilize photoactive Ru complexes as functional components for device fabrication. Hence, the incorporation of Ru complexes has attracted significant attraction, leading to a plethora of approaches in resemblance to the classification by Rau for CuAAc (Section 5.6),365i.e., the “grafting from”, “grafting onto”, “chelate then polymerize” and vice versa. However, the obtained materials often represent stoichiometrically controlled compositions due to the inevitable side reactions or incomplete conversion – particularly for the grafting strategies. Hence, the following paragraphs briefly present selected examples to highlight the conceptional approaches behind (Fig. 30), and the interested reader is referred to the more specialized literature.99 In this context, the groups of Meyer, Schanze, Reynolds and Papanikolas explored in detail Ru-containing polymers for light harvesting and surface immobilizations.
 Fig. 30  Schematic representation of selected examples for Ru-containing polymers: (a) RAFT copolymerization of methacrylates, (b) ROMP of norbornene-based monomers, and (c) polycondensation via diimide formation. 
The different methods can be categorized according to the position of the complex in the polymer, i.e., within the polymer backbone, in the side chain or at the chain terminus. The use of ruthenium containing monomers in the side chain often involves spacer units to account for the steric demand. The complexes bearing a polymerizable group on the ligand scaffold are subsequently polymerized via radical polymerization techniques, ring-opening polymerization or electropolymerization.

5.7.1. Radical polymerization. 
Numerous examples for the free radical polymerization using azobis(isobutyronitrile) (AIBN) as an initiator have been reported, dominantly for methacrylate-based monomers (see Fig. 30),327,375 vinyls208,376,377 or styrene.378 Furthermore, a water soluble azo initiator (2′-azobis(2-methylpropionamidine)dihydrochloride, “V50”) can be employed for the copolymerization with N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPAM) to form microgels.379 For the methacrylate as well as the styrene functionalized complexes, controlled polymerization techniques are promising alternatives toward the control of dispersity and molar mass. For example, the RAFT polymerization is reported to yield polymers with low dispersity according to the controlled living character of this technique.380–382 Also, ATRP is a polymerization technique to introduce the complexes. The CuBr/PMDETA combination (see also Section 5.6) was used for the preparation of ruthenium-containing (co)polymers based on vinyl monomers383 or styrene monomers.238 In addition to these selected examples, alternative initiator systems were reported for ATRP and RAFT polymerizations. The latter one is used for the polymerization of (dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate (PDMAEMA). The ATRP technique was applied for a Ru-based metallostar that bears six initiator groups for the polymerization of MMA,194 including a Ni-mediated version for pristine methacrylates384 or carbazole-equipped MMA using a Ru with a single initiating site.385,386


5.7.2. Ring-opening polymerization. 
The incorporation of [Ru(bpy)3]2+ units was accomplished by the corresponding succinimide-207 or norbornene387,388 derivatives via ring opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP), using the Grubbs-catalyst (Fig. 30). A variety of linkage patterns have been reported that are mainly based on aromatic diimide moieties. Another example of a chain-end decorated polymer is reported by Schulze et al., who utilized a hydroxymethyl-decorated [Ru(dqp)2]2+ to initiate the ring opening polymerization of caprolactone to yield biodegradable polymers.256


5.7.3. Polycondensation. 
The incorporation of ruthenium complexes in the backbone can be achieved by polycondensation reactions, e.g., via diimide formation. The reaction often involves the condensation of a bis-amino-functionalized monomer with a bis-anhydride-decorated monomer. This reaction was investigated by Ng et al. with a series of aryl spacer units (see Fig. 30).389 Another polycondensation was investigated by Rasmussen et al., who polymerized a bis-amino-decorated [Ru(bpy)3]2+ complex with glyoxal to form a conjugated backbone.390 Wild et al. utilized the nucleophilic substitution of thiols with pentafluorobenzene units to prepare metallopolymers.282 The Heck cross-coupling reactions are used to build up a block copolymer of a ruthenium bipyridine complex in the backbone with a NLO chromophore using Pd(OAc)2 and P(OPhMe)3 as catalysts.391,392 Alternatively, a multitude of examples have been reported for the preparation of metallopolymers via complexation, in analogy to the formation of metallostars or dendrimers (Section 5.1). Due to the enormous number of published examples to prepare metallopolymers from metal-containing precursors, an adequate discussion is beyond the scope of this review.


5.7.4. Electropolymerization. 
Another applicable polymerization technique is electropolymerization, whereby radicals are formed during an electrochemical redox process. The radicals can recombine irreversibly to form linear or branched architectures, depending on the number of electropolymerizable units per monomer. In contrast to related radical polymerization techniques, the course of the polymerization can be controlled by the potential–time program and monitored by the corresponding current–time response. In this view, the sweep cycles in cyclic voltammetry can be utilized to initiate and stop the electropolymerization process reversibly. In case of depositioning of the formed polymer, this technique offers attractive opportunities to control the film morphologies, thicknesses, etc. Typical electropolymerizable groups comprise vinyls,280,393–403 arylamines,404–407 thiophenes in all variations,142,347,408–415 selenophene416 or pyrroles (see Fig. 31).417–419 In order to form linear metallopolymers, at least two reactive positions are necessary, while additional sites allow the formation of cross-linked networks. For example, triarylamine- and N-linked pyrrole Ru complexes can be electropolymerized with only one functional group of this kind, while thiophenes or vinyl groups require a minimum of two times to generate electropolymerization. In summary, electropolymerization is a powerful technique to prepare conjugated multicolored electrochromic films, as demonstrated by extensive work by the Zhong group.

6. Purification methods
This section reviews the various aspects of purifying Ru complexes in the context of “chemistry-on-the-complex”. Due to the charged nature of the educts, the byproducts and the desired target compounds, reliable separation is challenging and often requires combinations of extraction, crystallization and chromatography protocols. The metrics of the reported literature highlights the importance of chromatography, accounting for 90% of the publications (Fig. 32). Nevertheless, it appears that independent working groups established their own “in-house” protocols based on their own experience and available instrumentation, but restrict interested readers to drawing a strict connection to their own purification scenario. In other works, relating the molecular structure or functionality to a specific purification protocol is difficult and results often in a trial-and-error approach. Hence, this section aims to present a comprehensive list of classified purification protocols, and may help the reader to navigate to related examples.
 Fig. 32  Metrics of applied purification methods for the “chemistry-on-the-complex” methodology.104 
6.1. General aspects
The separation of ruthenium complexes often represents a severe practical challenge to isolate pure target compounds after synthesis. The purification of Ru complexes can be successful using solely extraction52,70,153,199,201,219,281,312,368,371,420,421 or precipitation protocols,54,65,148,209,210,212,282,358,368,374 – but generally additional purification steps are mandatory. Nevertheless, these initial steps are elementary and are conventionally performed to remove organic byproducts or inorganic salts prior to the final purification via crystallization or chromatography. In the case of crystallization, the knowledge or development of optimal conditions for the specific target complex is crucial. Challenges arise from the optimization of solvent mixtures and conditions, such as losses due to impure fractions upon fractionated collection or the small quantities that are to be separated. In this view, chromatographic protocols are highly desirable and appear promising, yet there are marked differences between the separation of charge-neutral organic molecules and charged Ru complexes. As a consequence of their ionic nature, such complexes often require more polar eluting conditions than those required for neutral organic compounds. Namely, the retention among complexes bearing different organic moieties is only little affected by the associated “subtle” polarity differences. In essence, the interaction with the typical polar stationary phase (silica, alumina, etc.) increases with smaller size and higher charge of the complexes, as illustrated by the electrostatic potential (ESP) plots of representative complexes (Fig. 33). For example, the mono-cationic cyclometalated complex A elutes with admixed methanol on silica, while the dicationic congener B featuring an identical shape and size requires salt additives for elution. The steric shielding by peripheral substituents generally diminishes the extent of retention to a borderline case, which has been investigated in great detail by Fletcher and Keene for ion pairing (Section 7.1.5).
 Fig. 33  Electrostatic potential (ESP) plots mapped on the electron densities of representative RuII complexes featuring (a) cyclometalating ligands, and (b) neutral polypyridyl-type ligand scaffolds including (c) multiarylated ligand frameworks; counterions were omitted for clarity. Data reproduced from the literature (A422 and B/C131) and re-plotted to illustrate the ESP differences (isovalues of electron density set to 0.0004, color mapping adjusted from less positive (red, +0.05) to more positive (blue, +0.20) values). Note the identical shapes and sizes of complexes A and B, but the less positive ESP of mono-cationic A (orange, <0.10) vs. dicationic B (blue, >0.15). Note for complex C the remaining void regions to access the complex core (indicated by arrows), but the sizable steric screening by the peripheral aryl substituents displaying intermediate ESP values (0.10 to 0.20) due to the electrostatic polarization by the RuII core. 
In summary, the majority of the reported chromatographic purifications employ silica gel and salt-containing eluents, which work best to separate Ru complexes with large differences in size and charge. This simple argument explains the dominance of the coordination as the final synthetic step, as the Ru solvent byproduct or Ru salts can be removed rather easily. Notably, the scope of chromatography broadened significantly within the last few years owing to novel commercialized stationary phases at competitive costs (surface-modified gels, size exclusion media), which permits salt-free conditions and enhanced resolution. These features are highly desirable, in particular in combination with automated purification systems, avoiding also the need for the additional counterion exchange step after ordinary column chromatography. The following section summarizes typical conditions for extraction methods (Section 6.2), crystallization (Section 6.3) and chromatographic methods based on adsorption (Section 7.1) or the size-exclusion phenomenon (Section 7.2), including automated instrumentation techniques (Section 7.3). In this regard, the recent progress in semi-preparative automated chromatography offers resource-efficient, time-saving and broadly applicable protocols.
6.2. Extraction by dialysis
One of the most facile purification steps relies on extraction. In most cases, a sufficiently large polarity difference is necessary for effective purification via extraction, which is often limited to the removal of neutral specimens (organic reagents, free ligands, etc.) from more polar Ru complexes. Alternatively, selective solvents may be utilized – if known – for Soxhlet extractions or washing of crude products. In addition, the functionalization of the Ru complex by a polymer enables the extractive purification via the size exclusion effect of a dialysis membrane. In this case, specimens smaller than the molecular-weight-cut-off (MWCO) can pass through the membrane from the interior to the exterior solvent reservoir. The extraction solvent is usually refreshed several times to reach quantitative extraction, which renders this method time-consuming. Nevertheless, this method can be very efficient and various molecular-weight-cut-off (MWCO) membranes are commercialized, often termed according to their pore size. Meyer and coworkers reported the grafting of azide-functionalized poly(propylacrylate) with an alkyne-decorated [Ru(bpy)3]2+ complex by applying the CuAAc reaction, whereby an excess of the unreacted complex was removed with a nominal MWCO value of 3.5 kDa.288 Likewise, the successful separation after CuAAC-promoted grafting of alkyne-decorated [Ru(bpy)2(phen)]2+ to poly(4-vinylbenzylazide) is reported by Schanze and coworkers after anion metathesis to chloride (MWCO of 12–14 kDa).374 A stimuli-responsive microgel was synthesized via copolymerization of a vinyl-decorated [Ru(bpy)3]2+ complex and N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPAM), utilizing a dialysis (MWCO of 10 kDa) with water as solvent (daily three times for 7 days at room temperature).379 Ghosh et al. reported the removal of residual [Ru(bpy)3]2+-based dye after the NHS–ester coupling to a functionalized albumin (500–1000 Da MWCO, Millipore tubing).204 The Tew group used dialysis with water to remove N-ethylmorpholinium chloride after ring-opening metathesis (co-)polymerization (ROMP) of a norbornene-equipped [Ru(tpy)2]2+ complex (MWCO of 8 kDa).388 Notably, the authors monitored the process by conductivity measurements of the water (until 0.1 μS) and further confirmed the removal by 1H NMR and FTIR analysis. Bell et al. reported the removal of non-covalently attached dicarboxylated [Ru(bpy)3]2+ complexes and colloidal anatase fractions (approximately 2 nm) by extensive dialysis (MWCO of 6–8 kDa) from larger dye-loaded TiO2 particles.423 These selected examples illustrate the versatility of dialysis for the purification of Ru complexes after grafting, copolymerization and immobilization onto nanoparticles, ranging from synthetic polymers based on styrenes and acrylates as well as norbornenes to polypeptides and even inorganic semiconductor particles.
6.3. Crystallization
The purification of ruthenium complexes is often achieved by crystallization. The most frequently used method is vapor diffusion of a volatile non-solvent into a stock solution under ambient conditions, while liquid–liquid layering techniques of the non-solvent and solution are less frequently utilized. The crystallization process is initiated by the diffusion of the non-solvent, which induces nucleation due to the decreased solubility of the complexes. Next, crystal growth and Ostwald ripening occur. Depending on the nucleation vs. crystal growth ratio, amorphous precipitates or X-ray suitable crystals can be obtained. In order to accelerate the crystal growth, the concentration of the complexes should be as high as possible. In practice, the vapor diffusion is often continued and may lead to the concomitant nucleation of byproducts. Nevertheless, the crystalizing product depletes from solution and eventually reaches a concentration regime, where nucleation of the byproducts is inevitable. Notably, if the solubility of the Ru byproducts is comparable, the order of crystallization is dominated by concentration – which is frequently encountered in reality. Hence, the fractionation of several batches and the recrystallization of impure crops may become necessary.
The most frequently employed solvent mixtures comprise acetonitrile as solvent and diethyl ether as non-solvent.142,145,146,305,378 This particular combination has proven to be useful for various functionalized ruthenium complexes, e.g., for complexes with CN functionalization.161,162 Acetonitrile as solvent may be replaced in special cases by acetone54 or by dichloromethane,161 particularly in the presence of large solubilizing organic moieties, e.g., a tethered naphthalene diimide unit.147 Alternative non-solvents with sufficiently high vapor pressure include alkanes, i.e., pentanes, hexanes or heptanes. Given the miscibility of the non-solvent and actual solvent, alkanes are often used for THF391,392 or dichloromethane solutions, e.g., in the case of triads containing zinc-porphyrins,271 pyrene units,311,318,321 or aromatic amino groups.146
The crystallization from aqueous organic solvents was reported for acetone, acetonitrile or THF. Fletcher et al. described recrystallization from acetone/water and acetone/water/NH4PF6 mixtures, whereby the latter was employed for carboxylic acid or pendant bipyridine moieties.255 The acetone/water combination was further reported for various [Ru]–[Ru] and [Ru]–[Os] dyads,180 as well as Ru complexes bearing benzothiazoles for DNA binding.424 An acetonitrile/H2O (1:1) mixture was successfully used by Constable et al. for a series of complexes bearing bridging units as well as ruthenium triads.159 Aqueous THF was employed by Ji et al. for triarylamine-decorated Ru complexes.146
Miscellaneous solvent combinations comprise various organic–organic solvent mixtures: acetone/ethanol for binuclear ruthenium complexes,124,219 acetone/ethylacetate for multicore ruthenium compounds (trimers, pentamers or heptamers)186 or complexes bearing acid functionalities,208 propionitrile/THF for pyrene substituted complexes,318 and acetonitrile/toluene for ruthenium dyads.360 Single-solvent crystallizations have been reported for binuclear ruthenium compounds bearing phosphoric acid groups from MeOH,214 ruthenium–ferrocene triads from EtOH,239 or CuAAC-products from MeCN.367
In summary, crystallization from aqueous solvents or miscellaneous organic solvent mixtures requires a temperature gradient (refluxing, chilling), or the evaporation of the solvent. In the latter case, the reduced volume of the solution upon evaporation may lead to undesired precipitation in addition to nucleation on the surface. Since the exact experimental conditions of crystallization have rarely been reported and are hard to reproduce from lab to lab, the vapor diffusion method represents a widespread and robust alternative, as the solubility upon slow admixing of the non-solvent can be controlled. Hence, fractionation can be performed easily, yet this method is often time-consuming. Thermally-induced crystallization permits to work on larger scales, but the knowledge of optimal experimental conditions becomes important, which renders this method suitable in the case of established synthesis routes, e.g., to prepare building blocks for the “chemistry-on-the-complex” approach (vide supra).
7. Chromatography
Liquid chromatography represents the most powerful and by far the most widely applied technique for the purification of RuII polypyridyl-type complexes. Two major retention modes are available, based on adsorption (Section 7.1) and the size exclusion principle (Section 7.2), which will be discussed using selected literature examples that provide additional insights. In analogy to the synthetic routes, a comprehensive overview in terms of tabulated protocols and variants will be provided in the corresponding subsections. Although liquid chromatography is considered to be a general basic tool in purification and, thus, is expected to be known to synthetic chemists, this field advanced steadily to provide solutions for specific purification tasks. Hence, the following references to comprehensive book series may appeal to inexperienced scientists as well as to practitioners to upgrade their toolbox knowledge regarding fundamentals and modern instrumentation,425 including application cases426 and sample preparation.427
7.1. Adsorption chromatography
The final purification is often achieved by chromatographic methods, whereby adsorption chromatography plays the major role. Fig. 34a depicts the elementary features for retention. The species diffuse from the mobile phase towards the stationary phase, where adsorption occurs, and thus, the species is retained before diffusing back into the mobile phase. The most important stationary phases are silica (SiO2) or alumina (Al2O3) including surface modification. Fig. 34b depicts the representative surface functionality of silica, i.e., vicinal and geminal silanols and siloxanes. The Si–OH bond is substantially more acidic than the organic C–OH counterpart, so that the chromatographic retention depends on hydrogen bonding interactions with the substance, i.e., with lone pairs or aromatic π-systems. Their practical importance stems from the commercial availability and chemical inertness towards typical organic solvents, including aqueous and salt-containing eluents. Non-functionalized silica and alumina are often designated for single use, while their significantly higher costs due to surface-modifications advise their re-use (Fig. 34c), e.g., in automated instrumentation (Section 7.3). Trivial surface-modifications of silica (Section 7.1.1) or alumina (Section 7.1.2) involve the deactivation by water (Brockmann activity), as well as the admixing of acids/bases (pH value) or salts (ionic strength) with the eluent. Since Ru complexes are usually charged, the addition of a supporting salt is most often necessary. Alternatively, the chemical transformation of surface silanols is employed and leads to a variety of custom-modified silica gels. The most prominent examples are reversed-phase gels based on C8 and C18 alkyl chains (Section 7.1.4). However, the hydrophobic layer shields the polar silica surface at the cost of diminished interactions with the charged Ru complexes, in particular if no peripheral organic moieties are present. An intermediate scenario between polar silanols and non-polar alkyl chains is given by short alkyl spacers decorated with various functional groups. Among the many, diol- and amino-modifications play a particular promising role due to their competitive price ranging between silica and reversed-phase gels (Section 7.1.4). Notably, analogous surface modifications are extended also to polymer-based resins, i.e., polystyrene (PS) and poly(methylmethacrylate) (PMMA) reversed-phase media as well as carbohydrate-based stationary phases to feature diol- or amino-decorated surfaces. A more detailed overview dealing with size-exclusion media, which are predominantly composed of polymer-based resins, is provided in Section 7.2. In the following section, the different stationary phases will be described in detail and evaluated for the chromatographic purification task, in order to serve as a guiding and selection tool for specific Ru complexes to be purified.

7.1.1. Silica gel. 
Silica gel represents the most popular stationary phase that is applied for column chromatographic purification. The compatible eluents range from common organic solvents to aqueous mixtures, including acidic, basic or salt additives, to modulate the retention via the surface's silanol groups. In the case of ruthenium polypyridyl complexes, a salt additive is often mandatory to prevent the adsorption of the charged complexes, in particular for dicationic complexes. For this task, a suitable organic solvent for the Ru complex is selected and the ionic strength is adjusted by the aqueous salt mixture. The most frequently used eluent mixtures contain acetonitrile and aqueous potassium nitrate, due to their miscibility over a broad range to maintain a high solubility of the Ru complexes. Alternative salts are applied occasionally, e.g., sodium nitrate (NaNO3) and potassium hexafluorophosphate (KPF6). Notably, the use of the PF6− salts offers the possibility of omitting the anion exchange after the chromatographic purification. Applying these typical eluent conditions enables the facile separation of differently charged specimens; however, the purification of functionalized Ru complexes with the same charges can become tedious, in particular if the polarity differences are only marginal in the ligand periphery. In this case, alternative (co-)solvents were successfully applied, e.g., various mixtures of dichloromethane or acetonitrile with alcoholic solvents as water surrogates to modify the hydrogen bonding of the surface. In general, the larger the organic fragments become the less polar eluents are necessary (Fig. 35), because the organic moiety sterically shields the Ru core as well as it promotes the solubility in typical organic (co)solvents (e.g., CH2Cl2). An overview of published solvent mixtures with and without salts as well as their compositions is displayed in Table 6, including the classification of the peripheral functional moieties.

7.1.2. Alumina. 
Alumina as a stationary phase is also well-known and frequently used for column chromatography of metal complexes. Table 7 lists the various eluents for specific purification tasks. In comparison to silica gels, alumina is more cost-intensive, but its use enables additional features to optimize the separation. For example, the surface activity can be reduced by pre-treatment of alumina with water prior to packing (Brockmann's grade), or by selecting specific surface pH values (categorized as acidic, neutral or basic alumina). As a consequence, the alumina surface can be tuned to permit salt-free eluents. This is a practical advantage, because no anion exchange after purification is required. Hence, the most commonly applied combinations comprise salt-free eluents, e.g., mixtures of acetonitrile, dichloromethane and methanol.

7.1.3. Surface-functionalized gels carrying diol and amino groups. 
The previous sections account for the majority of established purification protocols for Ru complexes reported to date. However, advanced chromatographic protocols are sought after to transfer and utilize the recent advances in (organic) synthetic methodologies, i.e., to prepare and to purify more diversified Ru complexes. One powerful strategy follows the specific manipulation of the stationary phase to tailor the interaction with the compounds of interest. Among others, diol- and amino-decorated silica gels emerged as particularly promising candidates, attributed to their reduced surface polarity in comparison to pristine silica or alumina as well as their commercial availability at compatible costs. In the context of Ru complexes, salt-free eluents can be applied to omit counterion exchange, and thus, these gels are attractive as reusable packing materials, e.g., in automated instrumentation (Section 7.3). Despite their promising potential, surface-functionalized gels have rarely been used for the purification of Ru complexes.
Schroot et al. used both column materials for the purification of functionalized ruthenium complexes and ruthenium–polymer conjugates, which were synthesized via the “chemistry-on-the-complex” methodology.272 Importantly, these modified gels furthermore enabled the replacement of an aqueous salt-containing acetonitrile eluent by CH2Cl2/MeOH mixtures, which are compatible with the large organic polymer residue. The successful purification was assigned to minimized aggregation and insolubility during the chromatographic run. Also, a range of asymmetric cyclometalated complexes were purified with amino-functionalized silica.422 Notably, oxidation-sensitive complexes led to decomposition not only using ordinary silica with aqueous salt-containing eluents, but also during the necessary anion metathesis step. In summary, conventional flash column chromatography instruments can be equipped with diol- or amino-functionalized silica gels to provide a fast and reliable alternative (Section 7.3).


7.1.4. Reversed phase silica gel. 
Reversed-phase silica represents one of the most popular stationary phases in automated HPLC, but the application in flash column chromatography has been only occasionally found. The reversed phase can be subdivided by the number of carbon atoms of the alkyl chains. The McCusker group reported the use of C18-decorated silica gel in combination with an alumina column for the purification of a series of cyano-decorated [Ru(bpy)3]2+-type complexes, which were prone to substantial side reactions during synthesis and purification.161 However, an aqueous salt-containing eluent (MeCN/KNO3, 7/1 ratio) was utilized, yet the exact role of the C18-phase was not discussed in further detail. Sadhu et al. described the use of pre-packed cartridges with a C18-phase for flash column chromatography, applying a typical gradient program of H2O/MeCN containing 0.01% triflic acid to purify [Ru(bpy)3]2+–lysine–protein conjugates.67 A similar protocol was reported by Uzagare et al. for the separation of water-soluble sulfonated [Ru(phen)3]2+ complexes, relying on a MeCN/H2O/TFA eluent mixture.232 In summary, only scattered reports for the use of reversed phases in flash column chromatography can be found, and the main application is reported for HPLC (Section 7.3).


7.1.5. Ion exchange chromatography: Sephadex. 
The ion exchange principle represents a widely applied technique, which relies on the displacement of ions in a pre-conditioned column by charged target compounds (and vice versa for elution). Hence, the desired large specific surface is often provided by porous support materials, e.g., modified dextrans. In addition to the capability of ion exchange, the size exclusion effect may be operable (see Section 7.2). The most popular cation-exchange materials are carboxymethyl- (CM-) or sulfopropyl- (SP-) decorated Sephadex C-25, where “C-25” denotes the degree of porosity. Hence, the carbohydrate backbone carries carboxylic acid moieties or sulfonate groups and, thus, this stationary phase is well suited for the separation of cationic specimens. In the context of bpy- or phen-type Ru complexes, Λ/Δ isomers or fac/mer isomers of [Ru(N^N)3]2+-type complexes can be separated. It is also useful for the purification of more simple complexes like RuII complexes bearing acid or ester groups,211 butyl-linked pyrene moieties,439 additional free bpy units for iron coordination255 or pendant amino-butane groups.253 In this case, the non-ionic impurities were eluted with water, while the retained complex was obtained by changing it to an aqueous NaCl (0.25–0.40 M) eluent. A similar example was provided by Geisser et al. for the purification of a ferrocene-decorated [Ru(bpy)3]2+-complex featuring a dipeptide linkage, using Sephadex CM-50 and a phosphate buffered NaCl solution.217

Λ/Δ isomerism. 
The versatility of the separation properties of Sephadex for ion exchange and chiral resolution was established by the group of Keene, and continued by Fletcher. A comprehensive series of publications detail the role of different isomers, solvents, anions, temperature and substitution patterns. In one of the first studies, the separation of bimetallic complexes based on two [Ru(bpy)2]2+-fragments bridged via bipyrimidine was reported.441 These complexes can exhibit three isomeric forms, i.e., the meso-form and two rac-diastereomers (Fig. 36). The separation is reported to be challenging, yet it was achieved with Sephadex that was functionalized with strongly acidic sulfonate groups in combination with enantioselective solvents. The complex mixture was absorbed onto the anionic stationary phase and selectively eluted due to the competitive equilibria with an admixed electrolyte (typically Na+-based). The isomer separation was achieved with NaCl solution to remove impurities before the elution of the specific isomers. The best separation results were achieved with not only chiral eluents containing sodium(+)toluene tartrate or sodium(−)benzoyl tartrate, but achiral additives also gave good results (sodium toluene sulfonate), showing an optimal concentration of 0.25 M. A subsequent study focused on the influence of the anion, i.e., replacing the ubiquitous chloride by aliphatic acids (C2–C8 chains) as well as aromatic sulfonates and a range of benzoic acid derivatives.442 The authors declared the distance movement and the separation ability as the two important parameters for effective purification. While sodium chloride solutions featured a small movement and very poor separation, the use of acetate as an anion resulted in adsorption (no movement). The longer the chain length of the aliphatic part of the carboxylate became, the faster the movement of the complex was and the higher the separation of the diastereomers was found. Notably, branched alkyl chains did not increase the performance. The series of screened aromatic anions revealed the importance of the positions of substituents. While para-substituted carboxylates led to an enhanced movement and separation, ortho-substitution decreased the movement, and thus, no separation occurred. Notably, the underlying effect of the ion pairing of the Ru complexes was further corroborated by 1H NMR spectroscopy. Related examples of separation were reported for diastereomeric dinuclear ruthenium complexes with various bridging ligands, e.g., dipyridyl-oxadiazole438 or dipyridyl-thiazolo-thiazole,443 as well as trinuclear complexes based on the aza-derivatives of bridging triphenylenes (ppz, HAT).440,444 In these cases, a Sephadex C-25 was employed using aqueous eluents containing NaCl, NaOTs (where OTs is toluene sulfonate) or chiral dibenzoyl- or ditoluene-functionalized tartrates, whereby the latter additives undergo diastereomeric interactions and led to an enhanced enantiomeric resolution. Uppadine et al. investigated the influence of chiral substituents on the separation capability of Sephadex C-25 for ruthenium complexes bearing methylbenzylamine or bulky tert-butoxycarbonyl-diaminocyclohexane moieties.196 The separation was achieved via chiral anions like sodium dibenzoyl tartrate or the achiral sodium dibenzoyl-4-tosylate.

fac/mer isomerism. 
Fletcher continued to study the challenging separation of the coordination isomers of [Ru(N^N*)3]2+, where N^N* denotes an asymmetric bpy ligand. In this case, facial and meridional isomers of the tris-bidentate complexes can form in a statistical ratio of 3:1 (Fig. 37).445 Sodium toluene sulfonate and sodium hexanoate were initially employed that descended from the group's previous protocols; however, an effective column length of severable meters was required to achieve full separation (hexanoate ca. 3–5 m, sulfonates up to 8 m). This length was achieved by recycling the product-containing band – i.e., a peristaltic pump was used, which redirected the eluting band onto the column. In all cases, the facial isomers eluted prior to the meridional congeners, which was assigned to the hydrophobicity and mode of ion interaction. The facial arrangement led to a more closed solvent shell, while the meridional isomers formed a hydrophobic pocket that suggests more interaction with the stationary phase. However, if the complexes carried ester groups instead of alkyl chains, no separation was observed, which was tentatively assigned to the modified polarity. The methodology of chiral resolution was later transferred to the purification of Ru complexes bearing benzothiazole pyridine moieties for subsequent DNA binding.424
 Fig. 37  Schematic representation of facial (fac) and meridional (mer) [Ru(bpyMe)3]2+ complexes due to the mutual arrangement of the three methyl substituents (shown in red). 
The combination of Λ/Δ isomers and fac/mer isomers was assessed by the Keene group to separate the resulting cis- and trans-forms (Fig. 38).446 However, the authors observed incomplete separation by applying their standard protocols in a single run, and instead the recycling mode of the band was required. A higher separation was achieved for the meso/rac diastereomers using chiral anion sodium (−)O,O-di-toluene tartrate, while the cis- and trans-isomers were separated utilizing sodium toluene sulfonate. These results parallel the later observation by Fletcher for the separation of fac/mer isomers of mononuclear Ru complexes.445
 Fig. 38  Schematic representation of dinuclear ruthenium complexes forming isomers. 
In summary, the ion exchange principle was studied in depth for Sephadex materials. Ion pairing was identified as a promising strategy to modulate the interaction of the complexes with the stationary phase, which enabled the separation of Λ/Δ isomers as well as of related diastereomeric bi- and trinuclear complexes. Furthermore, with the help of recycling, the eluting band via a peristaltic pump boosted the separation efficiency, and enabled the separation of fac/mer isomers featuring only marginal differences in terms of ion pairing interactions (void regions). However, apart from these instructive seminal reports, this advanced purification has rarely been applied in the present literature.

7.2. Size exclusion materials
The size exclusion principle originates from the porosity of the stationary phases. As a consequence, molecules within the pores are retained and lead to separation according to the hydrodynamic volume, which is roughly related to the molar mass. A variety of commercial size exclusion materials are available, which are listed in Table 8, with their nominal exclusion limits. These values permit a simple orientation for selection of a suitable resin, but may be affected by the swelling of the material. For example, polystyrene-based resins tend to collapse under protic/aqueous conditions, while poly(methacrylate)- or carbohydrate-based resins are more suited for aqueous eluents. Another criterion, in particular if these costly materials are to be reused, is the long-term stability. In addition to the undesired trapping of substances, the surface modifications or the carbohydrate backbone may undergo degradation processes, which may affect the performance over longer periods of time. Nevertheless, an enormous range of exclusion limits is commercially available, i.e., ranging from 400 up to 50000000 Da.

7.2.1. Dextran-based materials (Sephadex™/Superdex™). 
Sephadex is frequently used for size exclusion chromatography applications. There are two major commercialized forms, i.e., hydroxypropylate (LH-20) and non-functionalized (G-25) Sephadex. These Sephadex resins are often used for salt removal (desalination) as well as the separation of organic compounds, applying optimal solvent mixtures. Related materials are Superdex, Sepharose and Sephacryl, which differ in the carbohydrate backbone or the kind and degree of crosslinking. Table 9 provides an overview of typical conditions reported for several types of Ru complexes.447–449


7.2.2. Polystyrene (Bio-Beads™). 
Size exclusion chromatography is mostly used for the purification of polymers. The Bio-Beads material consists of cross-linked polystyrene with different pore sizes. The largest pore size belongs to SX1, which has the highest nominal exclusion range (600–14000 Da). The other versions are SX3 (up to 2000 Da), SX8 (up to 1000 Da) and SX12 (up to 400 Da). The nonpolar material is best used with nonpolar organic solvents (toluene, CH2Cl2, CHCl3, THF), while polar solvents (MeCN, DMF) and particular protic solvents (MeOH, H2O) lead to a collapse of the pores. In view of Ru complexes, polar conditions are often required to promote a sufficient solubility of the complexes. One of the first examples for the purification via SX1 resins was reported by Chen et al., who performed a ROMP of a norbornene-decorated [Ru(bpy)3]2+-complex and purified the obtained block copolymer by applying an eluent mixture of toluene and acetonitrile (4/1).207 Around the same time, the Schubert group began to explore the versatility of the Bio-Beads resin for the purification of metallopolymers, e.g., from free radical polymerization of MMA-decorated [Ru(bpy)3]2+-complexes.375 Later, the versatility of Bio-Beads was demonstrated also for dichloromethane or DMF as an eluent to purify Ru-containing polymers as well as the possibility of recovering the [Ru]-monomers from the product mixtures after applying various polymerization techniques. For example, the reversible-addition–fragmentation-transfer (RAFT) copolymerization of olefinic [Ru(bpy)3]2+- and [Ru(tpy)2]3+-type complexes327,380,381 was investigated, as well as the rhodium-catalyzed polymerization of alkyne-decorated [Ru(tpy)2]2+ complexes.457 Breul et al. compared three different approaches for the incorporation of multiple [Ru(tpy)2]2+ units into the side chain of the PMMA-backbone: (a) the copolymerization of monomeric MMA-decorated Ru complexes, (b) the formation of a complex from a suitable [Ru(typ)Cl3] intermediate with a tpy-functionalized PMMA, and (c) the grafting of an alkyne-containing [Ru(tpy)2]2+via Sonogashira cross-coupling (“chemistry-on-the-complex”).327 The SX1 resins using DMF as eluent were successfully used for the purification after polymerization and coordination reaction steps, while the SX3 resins applying dichloromethane as eluent served for the removal of unreacted Ru complexes in the case of a grafting reaction. In both cases, the efficient separation is tied to the sufficient differences in the hydrodynamic volume and, thus, is related to the size and molar masses. A [Ru(tpy)2]2+-type block copolymer, which was formed by linking a telechelic [Ru(tpy)Cl3]-modified PEG-chain with a telechelic tpy-decorated polystyrene, was reported to be unsuitable, because the size exclusion limit was already reached by the individual coupling partners.458 Instead, automated fractionation via SEC in THF was carried out using a PSS Gram preparative 100 Å column that is applicable to higher molar masses (see also Section 7.2.3). In summary, Bio-Beads are well suited to remove small monomeric Ru-complexes from their corresponding (co)polymers using various eluents, mainly CH2Cl2 and DMF.


7.2.3. Poly(methylmethacrylate) (Toyopearl™). 
The Toyopearl resin family is based on cross-linked methacrylates and is usually applied for size exclusion or ion exchange chromatography of proteins and large organic compounds of biological origin, as well as for the purification of synthetic polymers. The material can be used under more polar conditions than Bio-Beads without pore collapse. In fact, even water can be applied as eluent. Although Nagai reported in 1992 already the use of ion exchange SE-Toyopearl and size exclusion HW Toyopearl for the separation of RuII complexes,459 not more reports have been found until recently. In line with their continuing interest in preparing and isolating defined Ru-based polymer architectures, Schubert and Jäger reported a series of publications that demonstrate the general versatility of Toyopearl resins.275–277,460,461 In fact, their high mechanical stability in comparison to Bio-Beads allows larger pores for Toyopearl, which permits higher exclusion limits up to 50000000 Da (see Table 8 for comparison). Various block copolymers with a single [Ru(dqp)2]2+ core were successfully purified, including poly(triarylamine)s, poly(naphthalene diimide)s or poly(carbazole)s bearing hydrophobic and hydrophilic substituents, ranging from aliphatic groups (C4, C8 or C20 chains) to oligo- and poly(ethylene glycol) groups. Although the exact choice of the optimal resin depends on the size of the macromolecular architecture, the established protocols clearly confirm their general versatility. In summary, Toyopearl resins can possess high exclusion limits to complement the Bio-Beads resins for the purification of Ru–polymer-based architectures, in particular entering higher molar mass regions. Moreover, this methodology was implemented into an ordinary flash chromatography setup to save the working time and efforts, as will be detailed in the following section. Hence, this methodology is believed to evolve to an invaluable tool for the reproducible purification and, thus, preparation of hitherto unpreceded architectures.

7.3. HPLC and automation in chromatography
The use of automation in chromatography is widespread, in particular for analytical high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). Notably, this technique is also suited for the semi-preparative scale, but requires substantial investments for the instruments and the required columns. In this regard, reversed phase silica gel plays an important role as a stationary phase for HPLC, which is widely applied for (large) organic compounds with biological importance. As a result of the identical surface chemistries as described in the preceding sections (Sections 7.1 and 7.2), the same eluent mixtures are used. Nevertheless, the use of HPLC for the purification of Ru complexes is less frequently reported than other purification methods.
The reversed phase material can be subdivided by the length of the alkyl chain, which is bound to the silica support. The most commonly material is C18 reversed phase silica, but C8 and C4 are also encountered in the literature. More advanced reversed phase modifications include functional groups, e.g., cyano (CN) or amino (NH2) groups. The use of chiral stationary phases (CSPs) based on saccharides like cellulose or cyclodextrans enables the separation of enantiomers. An early selected example by the DeCola group reported the purification of lysine-decorated [Ru(bpy)3]2+ complexes after peptide coupling chemistry.230 Johansson and coworkers reported the challenging purification of three different isomeric forms (meridional, cis- and trans-facial) of [Ru(dqp)2]2+ using HPLC,130 as well as the enantiomeric resolution of [Ru(dqp)2]2+ using chiral tris(tetrachloro-1,2-benzenediolato)phosphate (TRISPHAT) anions.462
The C18 stationary material is used for the separation of labeled oligoprolines,370,433 peptides,51,63,64,200,204,206,235 ruthenium peptoids,228 proteins,226,232 and desoxynucleotides,203 with a mixture of acetonitrile and water as a mobile phase including admixed triflic acid (0.1%). Kumar et al. synthesized a [Ru(dqp)2]2+-based triad, which was obtained after the final oxidation of the quinone acceptor on the assembled triad scaffold. This example illustrates the necessity of “chemistry-on-the complex”, because the benzoquinone did not tolerate the coordination reaction conditions. The series of Ru complexes were purified by preparative HPLC using the C18 stationary phase and a mixture of water and methanol with Na2HPO4 or TFA as additives. In the case of related [Ru(bpy)3]2+-decorated oligoprolines, the Meyer group used reverse phase materials with shorter alkyl chains (C4 and C8) applying acetonitrile/water mixtures as mobile phases.231 The scope of HPLC is not limited to RuII polypyridyl-type complexes; in fact, various reports exist that employ HPLC to study more labile congeners. A seminal example by Kroener et al. dates back to 1988, which detailed the effect of ion pairing on the retention time of various thioether ruthenium complexes, applying the C8 reversed phase with a mixture of methanol and sodium heptanesulfonate.463 Thomalla et al. reported the analytical characterization using HPLC on C8-functionalized silica to discern the degradation of related [Ru(N^N)2(SCN)2] complexes used for solar cells.464 Due to the carboxylate groups on the bidentate ligand (N^N), sulfuric acid as an additive was used to control the protonation level.
An alternative HPLC application relies on the ion exchange principle. Such columns lead to a specific retention of the anions and cations, respectively, based on the interactions between the ionic compounds and the stationary phase. Hence, the main parameters to modulate the retention are the type of stationary charged group, the charge/size of a molecule and the ionic strength or pH value of the eluent. Among others, the precise impact of these parameters was explored in detail for dextran-based stationary phases (Section 7.1.5). In view of RuII compounds, these cationic complexes will interact with the stationary phase equipped with anionic moieties (e.g., carboxylic acids or sulfonates). Typical resins are based on polystyrene or dextran and are widely applied for the purification of proteins or other biologically relevant compounds. For such compounds, the admixing of acids or bases can further affect the protonation state of the molecules (amino groups, acid groups, etc.) and, thus, are useful parameters to modulate and enhance the separation efficiency.
An early example is reported by the Meyer group in the 1990s, which employed cation exchange column chromatography for the purification of their photoactive amino acid assemblies that carried [Ru(bpy)3]2+ sensitizer units and organic electron donors (phenothiazine) and acceptor (methyl viologen) in the side chain. The eluent is composed of acetonitrile containing 0.6 mM phosphate buffer.229
Shu et al. explored the enantiomeric separation of racemates of 21 polypyridyl ruthenium complexes based on the phen and bpy ligand system, using chiral cyclofructan stationary phases.465 The investigation concerned the impact of the applied eluents, additives, enantiomers, stationary column materials, counter ions, and the substitution positions of the ligands. The authors tested three different stationary phases based on substituted cyclofructan resins, which revealed that only aromatic substituted sugars led to enantiomeric separation, indicating that the π–π interactions of the aromatic rings are crucial. The applied eluent was composed of MeOH/MeCN (70:30) containing 1% of a trimethylamine/acetic acid buffer (50/50). The alternatively tested acids (trifluoroacetic acid, formic acid) and bases (trimethylamine, ethanolamine, tributylamine) resulted in less separation for the majority of the tested complexes. The observation that the 50/50 buffer outperformed the acids or bases suggested that the ionic strength is more important for efficient separation than controlling the pH value. Hence, various ammonium salts (NH4NO3, NHMe3(NO3), NH4(CO2CF3) and NHMe3(OAc)) were screened, which identified trimethylammonium nitrate as the best salt. However, its low solubility in solvents restricted its practical value and, thus, separation was performed alternatively by acid/base variation preferentially. A higher percentage of acetonitrile led furthermore to a decreased retention, while no major impact of the anion (PF6−vs. Cl−) was observed. The influence of the substitution position of the ligand system was also investigated (ortho vs. para position), which revealed that electron-withdrawing ortho-substitution led to a higher selectivity assigned to the higher π acidity. These results were consistent with previous reports by Sun et al., who investigated the separation on cyclodextran.466,467 In that study, eight mono- and two dinuclear complexes were tested, while the best results were obtained with a naphthylethyl-carbamate functionalized β-cyclodextran, while nonaromatic moieties revealed no separation. Also the influence of salts, solvent mixtures and anions reached the same results. The dinuclear ruthenium complexes consisted of peripheral phen ligands and a tetrapyridophenazine (TPPHZ) or tetraazatetrapyridopentacene (TATPP) bridge. Hence, these ligand sets permit three isomeric complexes, i.e., the meso form and the enantiomers (for details see Section 7.1.5). While the TPPHZ-bridged complexes were readily separated by applying the described method, the TATPP-bridged complex led only to partial separation. In a related study, further modifications of the stationary phase were tested using various chirobiotics (Teicoplanin, Teicoplanin aglycone, Vancomycin, Ristocetin A), which identified Teicoplanin as the superior decoration for the stationary phase under comparable purification conditions.466 Browne et al. used Teicoplanin-functionalized silica as the stationary phase for the HPLC purification of a dinuclear ruthenium complex bearing peripheral bpy ligands and a bispyridine–1,2,4-triazole bridge.468 In that report, two chromatographic runs were required for a complete purification. In the first run, the homo-chiral stereoisomers were separated from the mixed hetero-chiral complexes using an acetonitrile/methanol/aqueous NH4AcO (60/20/20) solvent mixture, while the hetero-chiral isomers were separated in the second run using ethanol instead of methanol. Another study detailing the purification of related ruthenium complexes was published by Nagai.459 Three [Ru(bpy)3]2+-based complexes bearing alanine, phenylalanine and tyrosine moieties were investigated in terms of their separation by HPLC using a C8-decorated silica gel, normal silica gel and tartaric acid functionalized silica. As a result of the systematic optimization, a MeOH/H2O/CH2Cl2 ternary solvent mixture in a 6/2/2 ratio containing LiCl as supportive salt was identified.
In summary, HPLC has been utilized for two decades to analyze and separate RuII polypyridyl-type complexes. The stationary phase is often C8-reversed phase silica gel, probably due to its broad applicability to other compounds, while specific (chiral) surface modifications have become available in the last few years, e.g., based on dextrans. In this regard, the details of ion pairing, recycling modes, etc., were found to be in excellent agreement with the ordinary column chromatography setup as detailed in Section 7.1.5.441
8. Conclusion
Ruthenium polypyridyl complexes are widely utilized for sensing and recognition, biomedical applications or energy conversion. In the past, versatile synthetic routes were developed to prepare the corresponding complexes, often via coordination of the fully assembled ligand as the final step. Given the evolving synthetic methodology to couple sophisticated functional moieties, e.g., redox-sensitive, temperature-sensitive or alternative chelating motifs, the application of classic routes may become prohibitively challenging. Alternatively, the transformation of functionalized Ru complexes attracts growing attention, as it not only enables divergent synthetic routes (modular building blocks, combinatorial approaches), as well as circumvents the intrinsic challenges due to chemical instabilities during coordination (e.g., biologically-active targeting functions), but is also used for the construction of functional molecular assemblies and machines. The most prominent examples for the conjugation of RuII polypyridyl-type complexes with functional moieties involve amidation reactions descending from peptide-coupling, various types of alkylation reactions, metal-catalyzed cross coupling reactions mainly based on the Sonogashira and Suzuki-type reaction, and azide–alkyne cycloaddition reactions. However, the versatility and success of the “chemistry-on-the-complex” approach inevitably depend on general and robust purification protocols, which involve the separation of ionic Ru complexes. In this regard, the recent significant developments of chromatographic protocols hold the key to this prerequisite, i.e., replacing or complementing ordinary silica and alumni gels by new commercially available stationary phases for adsorption and size exclusion chromatography, or automated instrumentation by HPLC or recycling modes. However, the applied purification protocols in the literature often originate from the respective group's expertise. Hence, a comprehensive survey of available protocols along with tolerated functional moieties is provided, including exact eluting conditions (solvent, additives, pH, ion pairing, etc.). In summary, the recent progress of synthetic and purification protocols demonstrates the potential of the “chemistry-on-the-complex” approach, which is believed to shift the frontiers of functional RuII polypyridyl-type complexes, and likely also other metal complexes. Consequently, new opportunities are provided by the “chemistry-on-the-complex” approach to extend the use of Ru complexes towards modern application fields beyond the chemist's expertise of coordination chemistry.

Tina Mede
	Tina Mede was born in Schmalkalden (Germany) in 1989. She studied chemistry at the Friedrich Schiller University Jena (Germany). Since 2013 she has been a PhD student in the group of Prof. Schubert at the Friedrich Schiller University Jena and finished her thesis in May 2018. Her research interests cover the preparative aspects of photoactive ruthenium complexes, including the modular design of photo-active molecular architectures.

Michael Jäger
	Michael Jäger was born in 1979 in Jena (Germany). He studied chemistry at the Friedrich Schiller University of Jena (Germany) and McGill University (Canada). In 2005 he moved to Uppsala University (Sweden) for his PhD studies to gain further insight into fundamental photosynthetic principles. After a short research stay with J.-P. Sauvage in Strasbourg (France), he finished his PhD thesis in 2009 and joined the Institute of Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry, Jena. His research interests cover photoactive compounds, and the controlled modular assembly of functional molecules into (polymeric) architectures.

Ulrich S. Schubert
	Ulrich S. Schubert was born in Tübingen (Germany) in 1969. He studied chemistry in Frankfurt and Bayreuth (both Germany) and at Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond (USA). His PhD studies were performed at the Universities of Bayreuth and South Florida. After a postdoctoral training with J.-M. Lehn at the University of Strasbourg (France), he moved to the TU Munich (Germany) and obtained his Habilitation in 1999. During 1999–2000 he was Professor at the University of Munich and during 2000–2007 Full-Professor at the TU Eindhoven (the Netherlands). Since 2007, he has been a Full-Professor at the Friedrich Schiller University Jena, Germany.

 	Fig. 1  (a) Simplified representative energy scheme and occurring photophysical events for RuII polypyridyl-type complexes.76 Light absorption (A, vertical blue arrow) leads to population of the 1MLCT state(s), which undergo rapid intersystem crossing and relaxation to the 3MLCT excited state. Decay to the ground state (GS) proceeds via emission (vertical red arrow), or non-radiative pathways include direct coupling with GS (process II) or thermally-active population of 3MC states (process III). (b) Representative application fields, depending on the precise excited state characteristics (i.e., lifetime, energy, or emission quantum yield). See text and ref. 5, 77 and 78 for more details.	 

 	Fig. 2  (a) Overview of archetypical pyridyl-based ligands bpy, tpy and dqp. (b) Coordination geometry in tris-bidentate (featuring Λ/Δ-isomerism) and bis-tridentate RuII complexes, as well as cisoid and transoid arrangements of functional motifs (orange and blue). (c) Overview of subunits used to assemble ligands for 5-membered and 6-membered chelation modes. Typical subunits are: five-membered heterocycles, bridgeheads or ring-annelated heterocycles, and cyclometalates and carbenes.	 

 	Fig. 3  (a) Metrics of ruthenium complexes categorized into preparation via coordination chemistry or “chemistry-on-the-complex” based on an extensive database survey.118 (b) Distributions of the applied reaction types for “chemistry-on-the-complex”.	 

 	Scheme 1  Overview of the main synthetic routes towards tris-bidentate and bis-tridentate RuII polypyridyl-type complexes illustrated for archetypical complexes [Ru(bpy)3]2+ (left), [Ru(tpy)2]2+ (middle) and [Ru(dqp)2]2+ (right). Synthesis starting from the representative Ru sources (black boxes) proceeding through RuIII (top) to RuII (bottom part) coordination chemistry. (a) RuIII precursor suggested for π-extended N^N^N ligands. (b) RuII precursor for selective ligand exchange for bpy and tpy. (c) Bench-stable RuII intermediates for N^N^N circumventing ill-defined [RuIII(N^N^N)Cl3]. See text for a detailed explanation.	 

 	Fig. 4  Schematic representation of the “chemistry-on-the-complex” methodology for (a) the conversion of functional groups and (b) the linkage with other molecular (functional) moieties (b).	 

 	Scheme 2  Schematic representation of representative transformations of functional groups: (a) selective CH activation of cyclometalated complexes and (b) representative functional group transformations. See also Section 5 for details and further miscellaneous examples.	 

 	Fig. 5  Schematic representation of the synthesis of stars and macrocycles: (a) synthesis of the arms-first and coordination to the core; (b) macrocyclization from metal-containing fragments; (c) decoration of the arms onto the ruthenium core; and (d) stepwise pathway for the synthesis of dendrimers (see also Fig. 6). The final reaction steps are indicated by arrows (magenta).	 

 	Fig. 6  Assembly of polynuclear dendrons using blocked coordination sites (green). Higher-order and heterometallic dendrons accessible via iterative coordination/deprotection steps.179	 

 	Fig. 7  (a) Schematic representation of complementary amidation reactions to couple Ru complexes (red spheres) with functional moieties (green spheres). (b) Typical functionalized complexes, i.e., carboxyl-decorated [Ru(bpy)3]2+ (left) and amino-decorated [Ru(bpy)2(phen)]2+ (right), including peptide coupling reagents (middle). See text for details, and Table 1 for abbreviations of coupling reagents.

Data reproduced from the literature (A422 and B/C131) and re-plotted to illustrate the ESP differences (isovalues of electron density set to 0.0004, color mapping adjusted from less positive (red, +0.05) to more positive (blue, +0.20) values). Note the identical shapes and sizes of complexes A and B, but the less positive ESP of mono-cationic A (orange, <0.10) vs. dicationic B (blue, >0.15). Note for complex C the remaining void regions to access the complex core (indicated by arrows), but the sizable steric screening by the peripheral aryl substituents displaying intermediate ESP values (0.10 to 0.20) due to the electrostatic polarization by the RuII core.
