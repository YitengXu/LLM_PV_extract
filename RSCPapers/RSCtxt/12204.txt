These recombination sites have a deleterious effect on the device efficiency. Thus, trap filling is used to increase the efficiency of devices. The traps are filled by dopants that either inject or extract electrons to/from the semiconductor. The trap-filled devices exhibit superior performance as compared to their unfilled counterparts. However, to date, this approach has not been explored in dye-sensitized solar cells despite the well-established presence of traps in them. The traps in the TiO2 photoanode are due to the presence of oxygen vacancies. Therefore, herein, we treated the photo anodes with hydrazine and filled the traps that increased all device metrics. Moreover, further sintering of the trap-filled photoanodes in the presence of hydrazine led to the formation of a nitrogen-doped photoanode. The device comprising a nitrogen-doped photoanode exhibited the efficiency increase of 23%. The detailed analysis of the device performance led to the conclusion that trap filling suppressed back electron transfer and increased the photo conversion efficiency.
Introduction
Semiconductor devices have revolutionized electronic gadget industries. Moreover, organic semiconductors have opened new avenues in electronic device research.1–4 However, one of the major limiting factors of the device performance is the traps in semiconductors. They act as recombination sites that have a deleterious effect on the device performance.5 Therefore, approaches have been developed to fill the traps and increase the device efficiency.6 The performance of organic light-emitting diodes was found to increase upon filling the traps in the semiconductor;7–9 subsequently, impressive charge carrier mobilities were observed in organic field-effect transistors upon filling the traps.10 However, the identification of proper dopants to fill the traps is challenging. Some dopants are unstable under atmospheric conditions; hence, they are in situ generated to fill the traps.11,12 Commercial molecules have also been found to be useful as trap fillers.13 However, this approach has not been explored in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). In DSSCs, TiO2 is used as a photoanode, wherein dyes are anchored. TiO2 has lattice defects due to oxygen vacancies, which generate sub gap defects below the conduction band.5,14 These defects act as traps.6 The filling of the traps by atomic replacement has been attempted using Al3+, Zn2+, Pb2+ and Fe3+.15–17 It has been shown that the conversion of Ti4+ to Ti3+ has an effect comparable to that of the replacement of Ti4+ with Al3+, Zn2+, Pb2+ and Fe3+. All these approaches aim to compensate the oxygen vacancies in TiO2. Moreover, the oxygen defects have been filled by nitrogen doping.18 Thus, in this regard, two approaches are in practice: (i) the use of low valent metal ions to compensate oxygen vacancies and (ii) filling of oxygen vacancies with nitrogen. Trap filling facilitates a faster electron transfer from TiO2 to FTO. It is necessary to recall the time scales involved in the electron transfer and transport in DSSCs. The electron transfer from an electrolyte to a dye occurs on a nanosecond time scale, whereas the dye injects electrons into TiO2 on a picosecond time scale.19,20 The electron transport in TiO2 followed by the transfer of electrons to FTO occurs on a millisecond time scale.21,22 Thus, the slowest event in the entire process is the transport of electrons in TiO2.23,24 This process is further slowed down by the traps. Thus, trap filling is essential to transport and transfer electrons to FTO. The transfer of electrons to FTO will also suppress the back electron transfer (BeT) between TiO2 and the electrolyte. The BeT has been controlled by various approaches. A blocking layer has been found to suppress BeT and improve the device efficiency.25–27 In another approach, conducting fillers, such as carbon nanotubes and graphene, were added to quickly transport charges to the electrode.28–31 Inorganic thin films coated on TiO2 have been shown to suppress the BeT.32–34
We hypothesize that trap filling can be carried out using hydrazine, which is a well-known reducing agent. We envision that the electron injected by hydrazine will convert Ti4+ to Ti3+ and compensate the oxygen vacancies. Furthermore, the photoanode can be converted to a nitrogen-doped photoanode by sintering the hydrazine-treated electrode. In this experiment, hydrazine acts as a nitrogen source. Thus, the use of hydrazine serves a dual purpose. Note that hydrazine does not have carbon atoms; hence, via sintering, the formation of carbon on TiO2 is avoided. This is one of the primary reasons to choose hydrazine over other organic reducing agents. In this study, we showed that hydrazine filled the trap states and increased the efficiency of the DSSCs. The sintering of hydrazine-treated TiO2 led to the formation of nitrogen-doped TiO2, which further increased the device efficiency by 23%.
Results and discussion
In the first set of experiments, the TiO2 photoanodes were treated with hydrazine. The time of treatment was varied between 10 and 50 minutes. Later, the electrodes were heated at various temperatures for either removing excess hydrazine or sintering. The N0–0 electrode indicated that the TiO2 photoanode was neither treated with hydrazine nor heated. On the other hand, the N10–70 electrodes indicated that the electrode was treated with hydrazine for 10 minutes and then heated at 70 °C. Cracks were observed on the photoanodes if they were treated with hydrazine for more than 30 min. Thus, the discussions were focused on the devices with photoanodes treated with hydrazine for less than 30 min. However, the complete device metrics for all the electrodes are presented in the tables. The representative XPS spectra for N30–70 are shown in Fig. 1. The Ti 2p core level spectra show two peaks corresponding to Ti 2p3/2 (459.0 eV) and Ti 2p1/2 (464.6 eV) for N30–70 (Fig. 1a). The Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2 peaks are found at 458.4 eV and 464.1 eV, respectively, for the N0–0 electrode (Fig. 1b). The shift in the Ti 2p core level energy values indicated the conversion of Ti4+ to Ti3+ in the TiO2 lattice.35 Furthermore, the peak at 61.5 eV for N30–70 is due to Ti 3s originating from Ti3+ (Fig. 1c).6 On the other hand, this peak is absent for N0–0 (Fig. 1c). These data confirmed the presence of the Ti3+ states that were absent before the hydrazine treatment. For the N0–0 electrode, we did not observe the peaks corresponding to nitrogen (Fig. 1d). On the other hand, a peak at 398.8 eV was observed for N30–70 (Fig. 1e). This indicated the presence of nitrogen from hydrazine on the surface of TiO2. For the N30–500 sample, a peak is observed at 401.7 eV, which is attributed to O–Ti–N in the TiO2 lattice (Fig. 1f).36 This corroborates our hypothesis that the sintering of TiO2 in the presence of hydrazine will result in Ti–N bond formation in the oxygen vacancies. We also obtained the O1s core level spectra that showed a peak at 532.6 eV for the N0–0 electrode (Fig. S1a, ESI†). This peak shifted to 530.1 eV with a profound shoulder at 532.1 eV for N30–70 (Fig. S1b, ESI†). These peaks are attributed to the presence of Ti–OH bonds. Thus, –OH functionalities also compensated the oxygen vacancies. The hydrazine treatment converted Ti4+ to Ti3+ and generated –OH functionalities in the TiO2 lattice. The sintering of TiO2 in the presence of hydrazine filled the oxygen vacancies with nitrogen. The intensity of the emission spectra of TiO2 provided information about trap filling.37 The emission spectra of the thin films of N0–0 and N30–500 are shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†). The intensity of the peaks centered at 452 nm and 469 nm decreased for N30–500 as compared to that in the case of N0–0. This is an indication of filled traps.38 An important question was related to the morphology of TiO2 upon treatment with hydrazine. The change in the morphology may impact the device efficiency.39 All the samples were subjected to SEM and TEM imaging. The SEM images showed a particle-type morphology for TiO2 irrespective of the presence of hydrazine (Fig. S3b and c, ESI†). Similarly, no difference in the morphology was observed among the samples in the HR-TEM images (Fig. S3e and f, ESI†). However, we found changes in the lattice fringes of N0–0 and N30–500. The distance between the lattice fringes was 0.350 nm and 0.341 nm for N0–0 and N30–500 (Fig. S4, ESI†), respectively. The elemental mapping (EDS) analysis showed that nitrogen was evenly distributed throughout TiO2 (Fig. S3i, ESI†). However, nitrogen was not found in N0–0 (Fig. S3l, ESI†). This indicated that the hydrazine treatment and subsequent sintering led to the incorporation of nitrogen into the TiO2 lattice. After obtaining this information, we proceeded to fabricate the DSSCs using the N719 dye and idolyte as the electrolyte. The counter electrode was Pt-coated FTO. The J–V curves are shown in Fig. 2a. The device metrics are presented in Table 1. The device with the N0–0 electrode showed the efficiency (η) of 9.04 ± 0.14. The η value increased to 10.43 ± 0.12 for N30–70. Please note that this sample was treated with hydrazine and heated to remove excess hydrazine. The XPS data showed that this sample had Ti3+ in the TiO2 lattice in addition to Ti4+. The presence of a metal ion with lower valency has been shown to compensate the oxygen vacancy and improve the device efficiency. Thus, we attributed the increase in the η to the oxygen vacancy compensation by Ti3+. The η further increased to 11.15 ± 0.18 for N30–500. This increase is attributed to the nitrogen doping of the oxygen vacancies, which are known as trap sites. The trap filling also decreased the band gap of TiO2 by 0.3 eV (Fig. 2b). The band gap decrease also improved light absorption, leading to an increased power conversion efficiency.40

The increased light absorption presumably led to the formation of excitons in TiO2.41,42 The electrons generated from the excitons are likely to be injected into the electrode. The highest Jsc of 19.12 ± 0.18 was observed for the devices with N30–500 due to the decreased band gap and filled traps. Please note that the trap-filled photoanodes efficiently transported the electrons and transferred them to FTO. Due to these reasons, the device with the N30–500 photoanode showed maximum Jsc. These devices also showed increased Voc (Table 1). The decrease in the TiO2 band gap should have decreased Voc. However, we observed the opposite trend. This was due to trap filling, which resulted in higher Fermi energy despite the decrease in the band gap. Due to this change, the Voc also increased.21,43,44
The response of the devices to light illumination is another way to confirm the device performance. In this experiment, the device is exposed to light and dark, and the Jsc and Voc values are measured as a function of time. The photocurrent increased upon illumination and decreased in the absence of illumination (Fig. 2c). The response time for the increase and decrease was same for the devices with either N30–500 or N0–0. However, the Jsc value was 20% higher for the device with N30–500 as compared to that for the device with N0–0. This data matched with the data obtained for the IPCE (Fig. 2d). The IPCE spectra are shown in Fig. 2d. The device with N30–500 showed a maximum photon to electron conversion percentage of 90%, which was 20% higher than that of N0–0. From the dye desorption studies, we found that the dye loading was the same for all the devices (Fig. S5, ESI†). Thus, the increase in the device efficiency was due to the compensation of the oxygen vacancy/trap filling. Similarly, the Voc for N30–500 was higher than that of N0–0 (Fig. 2e), which also matched with the Voc measured via the J–V experiment (Fig. 2a). The device efficiency increased if the electrons injected into TiO2 were efficiently transferred to FTO.45 Otherwise, the device performance started deteriorating;46,47 thus, to prepare modified TiO2, the electrons had to be efficiently transported to FTO by filling the traps. This was confirmed by the stable performance of the device with the N30–500 electrode under light illumination (Fig. 2f). The device degraded rather quickly when N0–0 was used as the photoanode (Fig. 2f).
To understand the electron transfer processes and electron transport, electrochemical impedance spectra of the devices were obtained. The EIS spectra were obtained between 10 MHz and 3 MHz under the dark condition when the device was biased at 0.5 V. The Nyquist plot showed a small semicircle at high frequencies and a large semicircle at low frequencies (Fig. 3a). The high frequency semicircle was related to the electron transfer at the counter electrode and electrolyte interface. The low frequency semicircle was related to the TiO2/dye and electrolyte interface.48 From the EIS, the recombination resistance (Rrec), chemical capacitance (Cμ) and electron life time (τ) were calculated, and the data are summarized in Table 2. Among the devices, the highest recombination resistance of 101 Ω was observed for the device with N30–500. In fact, the Rrec of N30–500 was found to be higher at all the applied potentials in the range from 0.3 to 0.7 V (Fig. 3b). Please note that the XPS data corroborated that this electrode had the traps filled by Ti3+ and the Ti–N bond formation. Due to the trap filling, the BeT decreased, leading to an increased Rrec. The higher Rrec resulted in the accumulation of electrons in TiO2. This accumulation was quantitatively determined by chemical capacitance (Cμ).49 The Cμ of N30–500 doubled to 1.1 × 10−3 F cm−2 from 5.5 × 10−4 F cm−2, as measured for N0–0. Please note high Cμ was observed for N30–500 irrespective of the applied voltage (Fig. 3c). This is a re-corroboration of the decreased BeT due to trap filling. The lifetime of the electron was calculated using the following formula τ = Rrec × Cμ.50 The τ for N30–500 was 111.1 ms, which was 4.6 times higher than that of N0–0. In fact, the τ of N30–500 was higher than those of all other devices over the potential range from 0.3 to 0.7 V (Fig. 3d). All these experiments were carried out without light illumination.

In the next set of experiments, the Nyquist plots were obtained under light illumination when the device was kept at 0 V. Upon illumination, the two semicircles in the Nyquist plot decreased drastically (Fig. 3e and f). The Cμ for the N0–0 electrode-based device was 4 × 10−4 F cm−2, which was an order of magnitude higher than that observed when the device was in the dark (7 × 10−5 F cm−2). On the other hand, the Cμ for N30–500 was found to be 5 × 10−2 F cm−2 under illumination, which was two orders higher than that of the device that was kept in the dark (8 × 10−4 F cm−2). From these data, it was clear that the illumination of the devices generated a photocurrent that led to increased Cμ. The device with N30–500 showed two orders of magnitude higher Cμ as compared to the device with N0–0 due to trap filling that decreased the BeT and increased the transport of electrons to FTO from TiO2. However, another experiment used to understand the change in the recombination was the open circuit voltage decay (OCVD) experiment.51 In this experiment, the device was illuminated with a AM 1.5 G light source, and the open circuit voltage was monitored (Fig. S6, ESI†). Upon switching off the light, the OCVD decay started. For N0–0, the decay was fast. Contrary to this, the decay was slower for N30–70 and slowest for N30–500. The decay was slow for N30–500 due to the trap filling that suppressed the BeT.
Large-area device fabrication is a challenge due to the BeT and slow charge transport in TiO2.52 We demonstrated that trap filling suppressed the BeT and improved the charge transport to FTO. Thus, our approach renders the feasibility to fabricate efficient large-area DSSCs. We fabricated DSSCs with an area of 18.75 cm2 (Fig. 4a). The device metrics are shown in Tables S1 and S2 (ESI†). The large area device with N30–500 showed the η of 7.9%, which was 45% higher than that observed for the large-area device with N0–0 (Fig. 4b). The humongous increase was due to the suppression of the BeT and the increased charge transport that emanated due to trap filling. In fact, the fill factor (FF) is a direct indication of the decreased BeT.53 The FF for the large area device with N30–500 was 11% higher than that of the large area device with N0–0.

Conclusion
Herein, TiO2 photoanodes were treated with hydrazine to fill the traps generated by oxygen vacancies. Hydrazine treatment converted Ti4+ to Ti3+, which compensated the oxygen vacancies. The sintering of the hydrazine-treated photoanodes resulted in Ti–N bonds in the TiO2 lattice. These nitrogen atoms also compensated the oxygen vacancies. The efficiency of the devices increased by 13%. The device efficiency further increased by 23% upon sintering the hydrazine-treated photoanodes at 500 °C. The increase in the efficiency was due to increased recombination resistance and electron life time in the photoanode due to the decreased BeT. The BeT decrease was due to trap filling by hydrazine treatment and subsequent sintering. We have shown that this approach is effective for organometallic dye comprising DSSCs, but the photoanode is likely to be useful in other sensitized solar cells including perovskite solar cells.
