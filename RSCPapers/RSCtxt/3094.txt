Introduction
Inverted illumination compensation is important in energy-saving projects, artificial photosynthesis and some types of agriculture, such as hydroponics.1,2 However, there have been few reports of automatic illumination compensation devices (AICDs), which can adjust the amount of light given out by a lamp automatically depending on the ambient illumination. This form of illumination compensation involves three essential processes: the quantitative detection of the change in the ambient illumination; adjustment of the current or potential of the output of the light circuit; and compensation of the light intensity by a lamp. The first process requires a rapid and sensitive photodetector, which should be able to promptly detect any change in the ambient illumination. The most common photodetectors used are photoconductors3,4 and photodiodes.5,6 However, self-powered biodetectors based on photoelectrochemical biofuel cells (PBFCs) have attracted much attention as a result of their high energy transfer efficiency and their ability to operate at room temperature and mild pH values.7 Their low cost and simple fabrication mean that PBFCs can be adapted to develop portable and implantable biosystems.
PBFCs were first described in 20038 and can be used to convert both solar energy and biomass to electricity.9,10 PBFCs can be assembled in two different ways. In the first method, biocatalysts such as enzymes or microbes are applied to dye-sensitized semiconductor photoanodes such as tetrakis(4-carboxyphenyl)porphyrin/TiO211 or a photo-response semiconductor such as CdSe.12 In the second method, the biocatalysts are modified on electrode substrates without photoelectrochemical activities, such as glassy carbon13 or carbon felt14 and semiconductors are assembled separately as the other light-responsive photoelectrode. Yang et al.15 and Brune et al.16 have developed PBFCs assembled by the first strategy. However, these PBFCs are limited by the low energy conversion of the dye sensitizers. Interest has recently focused on the second assembly strategy in which many different combinations of materials can be used in PBFCs13,17.
We propose here a novel design of PBFC assembled using the second strategy consisting of a glucose dehydrogenase (GDH) modified bioanode and a p-type semiconductor cuprous oxide (Cu2O) photocathode (Scheme 1). The assembled PBFC had a high efficiency as a result of coupling complementary processes by combining the bioanode and the photocathode into a single cell. Both the open circuit potential and the maximum power output were much improved under illumination with visible light. As one of the PBFC electrodes was based on light-sensitive materials,18 the parameters of the PBFCs could be changed as the intensity of light was varied.19 Inspired by this light-sensitive behaviour, an automatic illumination compensation device was built using the PBFC as a photosensitive core element. The light from the device could be increased or decreased as the ambient illumination reduced or increased, respectively, and therefore the AICD could adjust the light intensity in an reverse manner, even if the ambient illumination changed irregularly. Automatic adjustable illumination equipment for the reverse adjustment of light intensity based on the use of a PBFC for the quantitative detection of visible light intensity has rarely been studied. This AICD will not only increase the versatility of novel photodetectors, but also guide the future development of intelligent energy-saving and adjustable automatic illumination equipment.

Results and discussion
A photocathode is normally based on a p-type semiconductor in which electrons generated in the semiconductor under illumination drive a reduction reaction. When the reduction reaction occurs in the dark, the electrons move to the Cu2O surface and are introduced to molecular oxygen. As a result of the low energy of the electrons from the external circuit, a reduction reaction should begin with a very small current at a slow rate. When the Cu2O is illuminated, holes and electrons are generated on the photocathode and the external electrons combine with the holes in the valence bands. The photoexcited electrons in the conduction band, which is maintained at a high energy level, then participate in the reduction reaction, leading to increases in the current and the onset potential. The Cu2O photocathode was manufactured on ITO by a simple electrodeposition method. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) results showed a typical reflection pattern of cuprite (JCPDS no. 77-0199) (Fig. S1A†); the most intense XRD peak for the Cu2O film on ITO is the (111) plane, followed by the (200), (220), (311) and (222) planes. There was no other diffraction peak in the XRD pattern, indicating that the electrodeposited Cu2O film had a cubic crystal structure. Fig. S1B† shows the results of the XPS analysis of CuI2p. The peak at 933 eV, which corresponds to the binding energy of Cu3/22p, agreed with the data observed for Cu2O.20,21 The EDX analysis of the Cu2O film confirmed the presence of Cu and O (Fig. S1C†). All these results proved that the film on ITO was composed of Cu2O. The SEM images in Fig. 1A and B show the surface morphology and cross-sectional structure of the Cu2O film. The Cu2O film consisted of angular cubic grains grown on the ITO surface; the grain size was not uniform. The cross-sectional SEM image (Fig. 1B) shows that a 1 μm uniform thickness of the film without any raised units was achieved after 20 min of electrodeposition. These results confirmed that the Cu2O electrode was successfully prepared by electrodeposition in a solution of lactate-stabilized copper sulphate.

(D) Onset potential of the response to light illumination of the photocathode with a 20 min deposition time with on/off cycles of 30 s in 0.1 M PBS (pH 7.0). 
The chronoamperometric i–t curves in Fig. 1C show a renewable photocurrent at 0 V that responded to visible light with an on/off cycle of 30 s. Cathode photocurrents were observed within a few seconds. To investigate the effect of the deposition time of the Cu2O film on the photocurrent response further, Cu2O photoelectrodes were prepared with different deposition times from 10 to 30 min. The Cu2O photoelectrode with a 20 min deposition time produced a higher photocurrent of −0.3 mA cm−2 at 0 V than those with an electrodeposition time of 10 or 30 min. The onset potential of the Cu2O changed between 0.07 and −0.06 V with the on/off cycling of light (Fig. 1D).
We used a Meldola's blue (MDB) modified enzymatic bioanode with GDH and a Cu2O photocathode to fabricate a PBFC. GDH was capable of selectively catalysing glucose to D-glucono-δ-lactone with the co-enzyme NAD+, consuming NAD+ and generating NADH in the process.22 The redox mediator MDB, which was absorbed onto a multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWNT)-modified GC electrode (GCE), was used to accept electrons from NADH for the GDH catalysed reactions to sustain the catalysis. CV experiments at the MDB–MWNT/GCE showed the electrocatalytic activity of NADH (Fig. S2a†). Although the enzyme GDH was modified on the MDB–MWNT/GCE, this bioelectrode showed electrochemical catalytic activity towards glucose oxidation, which was used as the bioanode of the PBFC (Fig. S3†). The catalytic wave was initiated at potentials more positive than −0.36 V and Cu2O was not transformed into Cu.
A PBFC was successfully assembled using a Cu2O photocathode and a GDH-modified bioanode. The variation in the open circuit potential (Voc) of the PBFC under on/off illumination cycles could be estimated by the change in onset potential at the photocathode only, while bioanode was without illumination during the experiment. The Voc was 0.29 ± 0.01 V under visible light and 0.19 ± 0.01 V in the dark (Fig. 2A). The potential response was very rapid with or without illumination and the Voc in visible light rose instantaneously and then remained constant. With 100 mW cm−2 visible light illumination, the maximum power output reached 161.4 μW cm−2 (RSD = 2.4%, n = 5) at 0.15 V (Fig. 2Bb), which was about 10 times higher than that of the PBFC in the dark (Fig. 2Ba). Fig. 2C shows that the photoresponse of the power output was also rapid and remained constant for seven cycles. To test the stability for long operating times, the PBFC was discharged continuously at the maximum power output with stirring in 0.10 M PBS containing 10 mM NAD+ and 30 mM glucose (Fig. 2D). The GDH enzymes retained a high level of catalytic activity and the PBFC maintained >65% of the maximum power output during continuous operation for nearly 4 h. The PBFC could be switched photoelectrochemically by illumination with visible light.23 The maximum power output of the PBFC was superior to that of previously reported PBFCs switched with either visible or UV irradiation (Table 1).

Fig. 2B and C show that both Voc and the power output changed rapidly with variations in the visible light intensity. The Voc responded and then stabilized in a shorter time than the power output and was therefore chosen as a measure of the light intensity. Further experiments under different light intensities were carried out using the Voc–t curve to confirm the feasibility of the quantitative detection of light intensity. Fig. 3 shows that the Voc of the PBFC responded steeply to a change in light intensity from 57 to 180 mW cm−2; the curve increased sharply in a very short time as the intensity of light varied and maintained a constant value under a constant intensity of light. There was a linear relationship between Voc and the logarithm of the light intensity from 57 to 180 mW cm−2 (R2 = 0.997) (inset, Fig. 3) and the detection limit was 1.01 mW cm−2 (S/N = 3). The reproducibility of this method was measured and the relative standard deviation for five repeated measurements at 100 mW cm−2 was 5.5%.

The Voc varied with the intensity of light based on eqn (1):24 (1)where Voc = open circuit potential, q = electron charge, k = Boltzmann's constant, T temperature in kelvin, I0 = reverse saturation current and Il = photocurrent.
The photocurrent Il was directly proportional to the light intensity when the light intensity was much more powerful (Il ≫ I0); in this instance, eqn (2) could be used instead of eqn (2). In eqn (2), Voc is proportional to the logarithm of the light intensity, which fitted the results obtained with the photosensor and means that eqn (2) could be applied to the PBFC system. (2)
Light intensity is important in agriculture, industry and our daily lives. Fig. 4A is a schematic diagram showing the construction of the AICD. The PBFC (blue ellipse), the core photosensitive element, was placed on a receiver (green board) illuminated by different intensities of ambient visible light (represented by the orange arrows) and then inserted into a light circuit (purple rectangle) with a power source to assemble the AICD. When the ambient illumination was changed, the variation was detected quantitatively by the photosensitive PBFC and was reflected by the signal, Voc of the PBFC. The light from the lamp in the circuit changed with the Voc signal. We prepared a model of the AICD (Fig. S4†) with a 9 V battery inserted into the device as an external power source for a red light-emitting diode (LED) and the photosensitive PBFC was added by connecting the “IN” to the photocathode and “GND” with the bioanode. The LED was connected to the “GND” and “OUT”. Fig. S5† shows that the Voc signal of the PBFC was amplified 30 times from about 0.2–0.3 V to 6–9 V and then the voltage output of the circuit decreased from 3 to 0 V after the voltage of the dry battery deducted the amplified Voc signal through a subtractor. A sliding rheostat in the circuit could adjust the voltage output further. The LED produced different light intensities by changing the voltage output from 3 to 0 V, which included the main emitted voltage range of the red LED. The performance of the LED under different illuminations is shown in Fig. 4 (see also video in ESI†). When the light illumination was 0 mW cm−2, the LED was at its brightest at about 3 V (Fig. 4B). The brightness of the LED changed smoothly because the voltage of the LED changed with increases or decreases in the ambient illumination between 0 and 180 mW cm−2. The LED emitted less than about 0 V, while the ambient illumination was at a maximum of 180 mW cm−2 (Fig. 4D). This suggests that the model device could change the brightness of the lamp both rapidly and sensitively with variations in the ambient light. The amplified times of the Voc signal could be even larger based on the slight fluctuation of the potential <0.001 V during the operation. The model device has the potential to be a practical device by replacing the LED and 9 V battery with commercial lighting equipment such as a filament, fluorescent lamp or Xe lamp. Ideally, it should be able to maintain a constant light intensity even under variable ambient illumination when the light from the AICD was almost equal to the intensity of the ambient illumination. A strategy in which the main circuit is influenced by a variable energy device might be both practical and beneficial for future automatic and intelligent devices.

Conclusions
A PBFC consisting of a Cu2O photocathode and a GDH-modified bioanode was fabricated. The maximum power output of the PBFC was 161.4 μW cm−2 under visible light illumination, which was 10 times higher than that in the dark. The Voc of the PBFC changed both rapidly and sensitively with variations in light intensity. We also designed a self-powered photodetector for visible light with a detection limit of 1.01 mW cm−2. An AICD was constructed with this self-powered photodetector as the core photosensitive element. This device could change the brightness of the lamp rapidly in a reverse direction to the variation in the external illumination. This study may provide new perspectives for self-powered photodetectors and illumination devices.
