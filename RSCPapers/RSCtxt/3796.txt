    , Accepted 3rd July 2017First published on 3rd July 2017AbstractPerovskite solar cells have emerged as promising photovoltaic systems with superb power conversion efficiency. For the practical application of perovskite devices, the greatest concerns are the power output density and the related dynamics under working conditions. In this study, the working conditions of planar and mesoscopic perovskite solar cells are simulated and the power output density evolutions with the working voltage are highlighted. The planar device exhibits higher capability of outputting power than the mesoscopic one. The transient photoelectric conversion dynamics are investigated under the open circuit, short circuit and working conditions. It is found that the power output and dynamic processes are correlated intrinsically, which suggests that the power output is the competitive result of the charge carrier recombination and transport. The present work offers a unique view to elucidating the relationship between the power output and the charge carrier dynamics for perovskite solar cells in a comprehensive manner, which would be beneficial to their future practical applications.
1. Introduction
Since the pioneering work reported by Miyasaka and co-workers in 2009, first employing CH3NH3PbI3 and its analogue CH3NH3PbBr3 as sensitizers in liquid-electrolyte-based dye-sensitized solar cells, together with fast-track research studies and unprecedented successes, a new class of photovoltaics called perovskite solar cells has emerged as next-generation solar cells. The power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of perovskite solar cells have increased at an unexpected rate from 3.8% to 21% over the past 7 years,1–6 and a PCE of even 22.3% has recently been reported.7 The extraordinary performance of perovskite solar cells can be attributed to the special optical and electronic properties of perovskites, including their tunable bandgaps with large absorption coefficients over the visible to near-infrared range, their unique long-range ambipolar charge transport ability and their low exciton binding energy.8,9 Notably, these impressive optoelectronic properties coupled with their simple fabrication processes through low-cost solution-based techniques, or alternative vapor deposition methods,10–12 have further accelerated the development of perovskite solar cells.
The photovoltaic performance enhancement of perovskite devices toward the Shockley–Queisser limit would benefit from a deep understanding of the fundamental photophysical processes and carrier dynamics occurring in perovskite solar cells. Ultra-fast optical spectroscopy techniques have been utilized to assess some intrinsic properties, such as a high charge-carrier mobility of 6–66 cm2 V−1 s−113–16 and long-range balanced electron–hole diffusion lengths from 100 nm to 175 μm depending on the fabrication conditions and the measuring techniques.17–20 These excellent performances could be attributed to the long lifetime of charge carriers and the high proportion of shallow defects in the perovskite.21–25 Furthermore, numerous efforts have also been devoted to illustrating the basic dynamics mechanism of perovskite devices. Impedance spectroscopy measurements have been applied to understand the electrical processes occurring in perovskite solar cells.26–29 The charge carrier recombination process is explored by intensity-modulated photovoltage and transient photovoltage measurements, while intensity-modulated photocurrent and transient photocurrent techniques are applied to reveal the carrier transport processes.30–33 However, the study of either charge carrier recombination or charge carrier transport of the complete device is carried out under extreme conditions, i.e. open or short circuit, where there is no current or voltage, and the real power output of the device is zero. That is, the measurements are not performed on the working device with effective load and power output, and cannot reflect the photoelectric conversion process under real working conditions.
In fact, all the studies on solar cells aim at the realization of their practical application,34,35 in which external loads are inevitably involved. In this case, different from the open or short circuit with the predominance of charge carrier recombination or charge carrier transport and the absence of power output, the photovoltage and photocurrent coexist, and the device has the ability to output power. Thus, there arise some new problems to be addressed. What about the charge carrier dynamics in the device with an external load/power output? How do the charge carrier recombination and transport dynamics affect the power output of the device? What is the essential relationship between the maximum power output of the device and the charge carrier recombination/transport process? Obviously, under working conditions, the dynamic processes would become complicated, which, however, are very important for the research on the application of the device. In this context, an overall picture to elucidate the questions concerning the power output and charge carrier dynamics of perovskite solar cells under working conditions is imperative, which is still vacant so far.
In this study, based on planar and mesoscopic perovskite solar cells under various working conditions, the variation of the device power output with different working voltages is clarified. The transient working voltage decay technique is built to investigate the transient charge carrier dynamics processes in the devices. Moreover, the relationship between the power output and the dynamics of the charge carrier behavior under the working conditions is illuminated.
2. Experimental
2.1 Fabrication of perovskite solar cells
FTO substrates (Pilkington, TEC-7, 7 Ω sq−1) were successively washed with detergent, deionized water, acetone and isopropanol for 15 min. Oxygen plasma was subsequently used to treat the substrates for 10 min. A compact TiO2 layer (c-TiO2) was deposited on FTO by spin-coating 0.15 M titanium diisopropoxide in 1-butanol at 4000 rpm for 40 s, and then annealed at 500 °C for 1 h in an oven. A mesoporous TiO2 (meso-TiO2) layer was produced by spin-coating a solution of ∼20 nm TiO2 paste in isopropyl alcohol and drying at 500 °C. The fabrication of the perovskite layer was carried out in a nitrogen-filled glovebox. For planar perovskite solar cells, a 1:1:1 molar ratio of lead iodide (PbI2), methylammonium iodide (CH3NH3I) and methylammonium chloride, with a final concentration of 0.88 M for each, was mixed in 1 mL of anhydrous N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), and then was spin-coated onto c-TiO2 at 3000 rpm for 40 s. On the other hand, for mesoscopic perovskite solar cells, the PbI2 (1 M in DMF) precursor was pre-infiltrated into the meso-TiO2 scaffold at 4000 rpm before reacting with CH3NH3I (8 mg mL−1) solution in isopropyl alcohol. After the deposition of the perovskite layer, the hole transport layer (HTL) was coated at 4000 rpm for 30 s. An HTL solution was prepared by dissolving 72.3 mg of 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9-spirobifluorene in 1 mL of chlorobenzene, to which 28.8 μL of 4-tert-butylpyridine, 17.5 μL of a stock solution of 520 mg mL−1 lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulphonyl)imide in acetonitrile and 28.8 μL of 300 mg mL−1 tris(2-(1H-pyrazol-1-yl)-4-tert-butylpyridine)cobalt(III) bis(trifluoromethylsulphonyl)imide in acetonitrile were added. Finally, the counter electrode was deposited by thermal evaporation of gold under a pressure of 5 × 10−5 Torr. Unless otherwise stated, all materials were purchased from Alfa Aesar and used as received.
2.2 Characterization
The morphologies of the perovskite films and the device cross-sections were characterized by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, JEOL-7401F) at an accelerating voltage of 5 kV. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was conducted on a Shimadzu XRD-7000 using Cu Kα radiation in the 2θ range from 8° to 40° at a scan rate of 2° per min. The current density (J)–voltage (V) characteristics were obtained by exposing the targeted cells to a standardized sunlight simulator, which was calibrated by a standard silicon reference cell to AM 1.5G one-sun illumination (100 mW cm−2), and sweeping over the predetermined applied bias voltage range from open circuit to short circuit (reverse scan) and from short circuit to open circuit (forward scan) without light soaking or voltage treatment history. A metal aperture mask was used to fix the active area to 0.1 cm2, and all data were acquired by a Keithley 2400 SourceMeter.
2.3 Transient photovoltage (TPV) and transient photocurrent (TPC) measurements
The cell was irradiated from the substrate side using a continuous-wave LED with a central wavelength of 530 ± 5 nm to generate different biased photovoltages (Vph). A Nd3+:YAG laser (Quanta-Ray Pro-230 Series, with a wavelength of 532 nm and a pulse width of 7 ns) was used to generate a small perturbation signal, which was controlled to be less than 5% of biased Vph. By adjusting the intensity of the LED, a series of desired Vph decays were obtained. The TPV results were recorded using a digital oscilloscope (64Xs, LeCroy) with 1 MΩ of input impedance (open circuit), while TPC results were recorded using an oscilloscope with 50 Ω of input impedance (short circuit).
2.4 Transient working voltage decay (TWVD) of perovskite solar cells
The setup for the measurements of power output and TWVD is illustrated in Fig. 1a. The target cell was irradiated using a continuous-wave LED (530 ± 5 nm) from the substrate side under open circuit to generate a photovoltage as the electromotive force for the external electric circuit, and then under this light intensity a variable resistor (0–10 MΩ) was connected in parallel with a digital oscilloscope (1 MΩ) to control the working voltage (Vwork) output. In this case, voltage and current are present in the simple circuit, and the device can output power. Thus, the working conditions of perovskite solar cells could be simulated. For the TWVD measurement, at each Vwork, a pulse laser (532 nm, 7 ns) was superimposed on the steady-state light to induce a small perturbation signal, which was controlled to be less than 5% of Vwork. Then the TWVD process was monitored using the digital oscilloscope. A series of measurements were carried out by adjusting the intensity of the continuous-wave LED (10, 25, 40, 55, 70, 85 and 100 mW cm−2) on planar and mesoscopic devices, and then the corresponding results of the simple circuit and TWVD were obtained. Fig. 1b illustrates the example TWVD traces of the planar device at a light intensity of 85 mW cm−2.

3. Results and discussion
The two typical kinds of perovskite solar cells, planar and mesoscopic ones, were prepared for study. The cross-sectional SEM images of the two device architectures are shown in Fig. 2a and b, respectively. Each layer (FTO substrate, c-TiO2, meso-TiO2, perovskite, HTL and Au) is clearly seen. The top-view SEM images and XRD patterns of the perovskite are illustrated in Fig. S1 of the ESI.†Fig. 2c presents the photovoltaic responses of the relevant devices mostly approaching the statistical performance, with a PCE of 15.7% for the planar device and 15.8% for the mesoscopic one at the reverse scan. The statistical averages of the photovoltaic parameters obtained based on a great number of sample devices can be found in Fig. S2 (ESI†).

Different from the open circuit or short circuit, when the solar cell acts as the power source in a simple electric circuit, the Vwork and the current coexist in the simulated circuit and the equivalent circuit is shown in Fig. S3a (ESI†). Based on the J–Vwork relationship (Fig. S3b and c, ESI†), the power output density (P) of the devices could be obtained by P = JVwork.36Fig. 3 exhibits the variations of the P with Vwork for the planar (Fig. 3a) and mesoscopic (Fig. 3b) devices. For a rough view, all of the P evolutions are divided into three distinct regions: the increase region, the quasi-platform region and the decrease region for both kinds of devices. In particular, this phenomenon becomes obvious with the increase of the light intensity. It is notable that the quasi-platform region of the planar solar cell is wider (∼100 mV) than the mesoscopic one under the same light intensity. In addition, the planar device shows more capability to output power than the mesoscopic one. In detail, the P value of the former is about three times greater than the latter for all of the Vwork values at each light intensity. It indicates that the planar structure may have its advantage of delivering power output. The underlying mechanism will be further discussed later.

To elucidate the underlying mechanism of the charge carrier recombination and transport process in the devices, TPV and TPC measurements were further performed, which have been widely employed for exploring the carrier behavior in solar cells.4,37,38 The temporal evolution of photovoltage at open circuit and photocurrent at short circuit can be obtained from TPV and TPC measurements, respectively. As reported previously, dielectric relaxation and ferroelectric dipole polarization can lead to a slow dynamic process with the lifetime approaching several seconds.39,40 However, in this work, the decay lifetime lies from milliseconds to microseconds significantly beyond the aforementioned effect, so the decay lifetime can be identified as the carrier recombination/transport time constants. Based on the exponential fitting, the charge carrier lifetime (τr) and charge carrier transport time constant (τt) are extracted, respectively (raw data along with coefficient weighted values are shown in Tables S1–S4, ESI†). Fig. 4a describes the dependence of τr on Vph for the two kinds of devices. The τr value changes from the millisecond scale to microsecond scale with the increase of Vph. It is notable that the relationship between τr and Vph for the planar perovskite cells on the semi-logarithmic coordinate shows a nearly linear correlation, which suggests that the charge carrier recombination process should follow the trap-limited recombination.41 On the other hand, for the mesoscopic cells, the tendency of τr variation obviously exhibits two distinct regions, which is ascribed to a biphasic trap-limited charge recombination process according to previous reports.42 The charge carrier recombination predominately takes place in the perovskite phase (Vph ≤ 700 mV) or meso-TiO2 (Vph > 700 mV) based on our previous research.43 The dependency of τt on light intensity is shown in Fig. 4b, which almost exhibits a constant value for each of the cells, similar to those in the literatures.31,44,45 Moreover, the τt value of the planar cells (0.11 μs) is about half that of the mesoscopic cells (0.22 μs), indicating slower charge transport in the latter. It should also be the underlying reason that the JSC value of the planar device is larger than the mesoscopic one even with the comparable PCE.

The studies of charge carrier recombination and transport by TPV and TPC mentioned above are based on two extremes without power output. How about the charge carrier dynamics with the effective power output of the cell? Herein TWVD measurements were performed to explore the charge carrier dynamics under the working conditions (Fig. 1b). To quantitatively describe the TWVD process, dynamic time constants (τn) are extracted by exponential fitting of the decay traces, and a fitting example is presented in Fig. S4 (ESI†). Fig. 5 shows the semi-logarithmic plots of τn against Vwork for planar and mesoscopic devices. Obviously, the relations between τn and Vwork are rather different from the TPV/TPC results (Fig. 4) for both structures of the targeted cells. It is found that the τn–Vwork curves are similar to the P–Vwork curves in Fig. 3. The τn–Vwork correlation also exhibits the evolution tendency of the increase region, quasi-platform region and decrease region for each light intensity, implying that the underlying dynamic process of the device is closely related to the power output. In fact, under the working conditions, charge carrier recombination and transport coexist and τn is the competitive result between them. Notably, the τn value of the mesoscopic device is about two times smaller than that of the planar one for each light intensity. As mentioned above, the planar perovskite solar cells have higher capacity to deliver power than the mesoscopic ones, which is in accordance with the underlying dynamic process. It should be pointed out that the charge carrier dynamics process under the working conditions involves charge recombination and charge transport, which are not distinguished in this work. In future work, it is important to conduct more specific measurements to quantitatively study charge carrier recombination and transport under working conditions.

The aforementioned findings prompt us to propose a detailed scheme describing the charge transport/recombination of perovskite solar cells under working conditions. The energy diagram of a typical perovskite cell is shown in Fig. 6a. At open circuit, photo-generated electrons and holes diffuse towards the ETL and HTL, respectively, and give rise to VOC without outputting current. The diffusion of charge carriers results in the depletion of electrons and holes, and charge recombination is predominant, as depicted in Fig. 6b. Fig. 6c presents the other extreme condition (short circuit), where the charge carriers are rapidly extracted to opposite directions and transport dominates the dynamic processes. The high electron density gradient of the conduction band of the ETL leads to the leaning of the perovskite conduction band. A similar process can be adapted to the behavior of holes for the valence band of perovskite. Therefore the shift of EFi gives rise to the electric field, which drives the directional migration of charge carriers to form current. Meanwhile, the EFn and EFp are balanced and there is no voltage output. So for both extreme conditions, the power output of the perovskite solar cell is zero. When the device is under working conditions, that is to say, the voltage and the current coexist and power output is not zero, the aforementioned charge recombination and transport occur simultaneously. The dynamic process of the charge carriers is the competitive result of recombination and transport, as described in Fig. 6d.

4. Conclusions
In summary, we have simulated the working conditions of planar and mesoscopic perovskite solar cells to investigate the effective power output and the underlying carrier dynamics process. It is found that, for both kinds of devices in the simple electric circuit, there exist three distinct regions of power output density with the increase of the working voltage: the increase region, the quasi-platform region and the decrease region. The planar device shows more capability to deliver power than the mesoscopic one. The transient dynamic studies demonstrate that the two devices exhibit different charge carrier recombination behaviors at open circuit and similar charge carrier transport behaviors at short circuit. More importantly, the TWVD results reveal that, under working conditions, the charge carrier dynamics is the competitive process between the charge carrier recombination and transport, which is closely related to the power output of the device. In addition, based on the results, mechanistic models to illustrate the dynamic processes are proposed. This work would provide new insights into perovskite solar cells under working conditions, which will contribute to the application research of perovskite solar cells, as well as other photovoltaics.
