    , Accepted 24th May 2012First published on 24th May 2012AbstractIn this work, three new quinacridone-based dyes containing a furan moiety (QA1–3) have been synthesized through simple synthetic routes for the application of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). Their absorption spectra, electrochemical, photovoltaic properties and the cell long-term stability have been extensively investigated. Electrochemical measurement data indicates that the tuning of the HOMO and LUMO energy levels can be conveniently realized by alternating the donor moiety. The theoretical calculations show that the dihedral angle between the quinacridone moiety and the furan ring is less than 1 degree, indicating excellent planarity between the two groups, which is beneficial for intramolecular charge transfer. All of these dyes performed as sensitizers for DSSCs tested under similar AM 1.5 experimental conditions, and a maximum solar energy to electricity conversion efficiency of 7.70% (Jsc = 13.25 mA cm−2, Voc = 804 mV, FF = 0.73) for the 20 mM chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) co-adsorbed DSSCs based on QA1 is obtained. Electrochemical impedance experiments indicate that the electron lifetime is improved by co-adsorption of CDCA, accounting for the significant improvement of Voc. Most importantly, the long-term stability of the QA1–3-based DSSCs with ionic-liquid electrolytes under 1000 h light-soaking has been demonstrated.
Introduction
Solar energy, a renewable energy source, is generally considered as the most promising way to solve the global energy crisis. A variety of other light-harvesting devices were developed rapidly, including dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs),1 which attracted great worldwide attention. As potential candidates for the future modality of photovoltaic cells, DSSCs manifest considerable efficiency and low cost, in which the sensitizer is deemed as the crucial component. At present, DSSC sensitizers based on Ru(II)-polypyridyl complexes have achieved power conversion efficiencies of nearly 12%.2,3 However, the large-scale application of Ru-complexes has become a critical problem due to limited resources and the hefty purification steps needed.4 Recently, a number of novel Ru-free sensitizers, such as phenoxazine,5,6 phenothiazine,7–9 diketo-pyrrolo-pyrrole10,11 and indoline,12–15 have been investigated and applied in DSSCs successfully. So far, impressive photovoltaic performances have been obtained using zinc porphyrin dye based DSSCs, which showed a power conversion efficiency exceeding 12%.16
Here we present three novel efficient dyes (QA1–3) (Scheme 1) with triarylamine as the donor, 5,12-dihydroquino[2,3-b]acridine-7,14-dione (quinacridone or QA) and furan units as the π-conjugated system and a cyanoacrylic acid moiety acting as acceptor. QA and its derivatives are well-known organic pigments with exceptional light, weather and heat stability,17 and they are not soluble in most common organic solvents due to the concurrent strong H-bonding and π–π intermolecular interactions in solid state. Soluble derivatives can be made by attaching long alkyl chains on the N atom positions of the QA moiety.18,19 To some extent, the introduction of long alkyl chains into QA rings can also effectively inhibit the charge recombination and increase the electron lifetime.20 At present, quinacridone-based molecular donors have been employed successfully in solution processed bulk-heterojunction organic solar cells and showed good performances.21 The triphenylamine can improve the hole transporting ability of the materials, and thanks to the nonplanar structure of triphenylamine, the formation of dye aggregates can also be relieved. Lately, triphenylamine-based dyes have been widely used in organic photovoltaic functional materials, especially in the field of solar cells.22–25 In addition, furan would be more efficient for hole location and reinforcing the stability of the dye-sensitizers owing to its smaller resonance energy (16 kcal mol−1) in the spacer than the thiophene (29 kcal mol−1) and benzene (36 kcal mol−1).26,27 Hence, there have been some reports on incorporating a furan moiety into organic dyes as an alternative to thiophenes for photovoltaics, revealing that the optical and charge carrier mobility can be quite comparable to thiophenes.28–34 Most promisingly, furan derivatives can be obtained from a variety of natural products, and therefore dye-sensitizers containing a furan moiety can be considered as renewable and sustainable synthetic resources and the production of DSSCs on a large scale can be allowed.35 To the best of our knowledge, there is only one report on the application of small molecular dyes containing quinacridone in DSSCs.36 However, the quinacridone-based dyes only showed a PCE of 3.86%, for which the main reason may be the lack of efficient donors and too large a dihedral angle between the quinacridone moiety and thiophene or the benzene ring (19.8 and 33.6 degrees, respectively), resulting in less efficient intramolecular charge transfer (ICT).36 Meanwhile, for QA-based sensitizers with different π-spacers (furan, thiophene, and benzene ring, Scheme S1†), we carried out density functional theory (DFT) at the B3LYP/6-31G* level in the gas phase. The theoretical calculations show that the dihedral angle between the quinacridone moiety and the furan ring is only 0.2 degrees, much smaller than that between the quinacridone moiety and thiophene or the benzene ring (16.4 and 32.3 degrees, respectively), indicating that the QA molecule bearing a furan moiety shows excellent planarity, which is beneficial for intramolecular charge transfer (ICT). Based on the consideration above, a new series of quinacridone-based dyes containing a furan moiety (QA1–3) were designed and synthesized (Scheme 1) as sensitizers for DSSCs. These dyes can be easily synthesized by a concise route and an environmentally-friendly procedure.

Experimental
Materials
Tetra-n-butylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6), 4-tert-butylpyridine (4-TBP), lithium iodide, and 2-cyanoacetic acid were purchased from Fluka. THF was pre-dried over 4 Å molecular sieves and distilled under an argon atmosphere from sodium benzophenone ketyl immediately prior to use. The starting materials 4-(N,N-diphenylamino) phenyl-boronic acid, N,N-diphenyl-4-vinylaniline and 4-(bis(4-methoxyphenyl)-amino)phenyl-boronic acid were synthesized according to the corresponding literature methods.8,37 All other solvents and chemicals were purchased from Aldrich and used as received without further purification. Transparent FTO conducting glass (fluorine doped SnO2, transmission >90% in the visible, sheet resistance 15 Ω per square) was obtained from Geao Science and Educational Co. Ltd. of China. Commercial TiO2 (P25) was used for the preparation of the nanocrystalline films.
Spectroscopic measurements

1H NMR spectra and 13C NMR spectra were obtained with a Brücker AM 400 spectrometer (relative to TMS). Mass spectra were recorded with a Waters LCT Premier XE spectrometer. Melting point measurements were performed with a SGW X-4 micro melting point meter. Elemental analysis was obtained with an Elementar Vario EL III spectrometer. The absorption spectra of the dyes in solution and adsorbed on TiO2 films were measured with a Varian Cary 500 spectrophotometer.
Preparation of the solar cells
The dye-sensitized TiO2 electrode was prepared by following the procedure reported in the literature.38 A screen-printed double layer of TiO2 particles was used as the photoelectrode. A 7 μm thick film of 13 nm-sized TiO2 particles (Ti-Nanoxide T/SP) was first printed on the FTO conducting glass and further coated with a 4 μm thick second layer of 400 nm light-scattering anatase particles (Ti-Nanoxide 300). Sintering was carried out at 450 °C for 30 min. Before immersion in the dye solution, these films were soaked in 0.04 M aqueous TiCl4 solution overnight in a closed chamber. After being washed with deionized water and fully rinsed with ethanol, the films were heated again at 450 °C for 30 min followed by cooling to 80 °C and dipping into a 3 × 10−4 M solution of dyes in THF for 12 h at room temperature. For the co-adsorption, chenodeoxycholic acid was added with different concentrations. To prepare the counter electrode, Pt catalyst was deposited on cleaned FTO glass by coating with a drop of H2PtCl6 solution (0.02 M in 2-propanol solution) with heat treatment at 400 °C for 15 min. A hole (0.8 mm diameter) was drilled in the counter electrode by a drill-press. For the assembly of DSSCs, the dye-contained TiO2 electrode and Pt-counter electrode were assembled into a sandwich-type cell and sealed with a hot-melt gasket of 25 μm thickness made of the ionomer Surlyn 1702 (Dupont). The redox electrolyte was placed in a drilled hole in the counter electrode by capillary force, and was driven into the cell by means of vacuum backfilling. Two electrolytes were used for device evaluation, in which one was composed of 0.1 M lithium iodide, 0.6 M 1,2-dimethyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide (DMPII), 0.05 M I2, and 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine (4-TBP) in acetonitrile (AN) as the liquid electrolyte, and the other was composed of 0.1 M I2, 0.1 M lithium iodide and 0.45 M benzimidazole (BI) in 1-propyl-3-methyl imidazolium iodide (PMII) as the ionic liquid electrolyte. Finally, the hole was sealed using a UV-melt gum and a cover glass (0.1 mm thickness).
Photovoltaic performance measurements
Photovoltaic measurements employed an AM 1.5 solar simulator equipped with a 300 W xenon lamp (Model no. 91160, Oriel). The power of the simulated light was calibrated to 100 MW cm−2 using a Newport Oriel PV reference cell system (Model 91150V). I–V curves were obtained by applying an external bias to the cell and measuring the generated photocurrent with a Keithley model 2400 digital source meter. The voltage step and delay time of the photocurrent were 10 mV and 40 ms, respectively. The photocurrent action spectra were measured with an IPCE test system consisting of a Model SR830 DSP Lock-In Amplifier and a Model SR540 Optical Chopper (Stanford Research Corporation, USA), a 7IL/PX150 xenon lamp and power supply, and a 7ISW301 spectrometer.
Electrochemical measurements
The oxidation potentials of the dyes adsorbed on TiO2 films were measured in a normal three-electrode electrochemical cell. A TiO2 film stained with sensitizer was used as the working electrode, a platinum wire was the counter electrode, and a regular calomel electrode in saturated KCl solution was the reference electrode. The measurements were performed using a potentiostat/galvanostat model K0264 (Princeton Applied Research). The supporting electrolyte was 0.1 M TBAPF6 (tetra-n-butylammonium hexafluorophosphate) with THF as the solvent. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements of all the DSSCs were performed using a Zahner IM6e Impedance Analyzer (ZAHNER-Elektrik GmbH & CoKG, Kronach, Germany). The frequency range is 0.05 Hz–100 kHz. The applied voltage bias is −0.70 V. The magnitude of the alternating signal is 10 mV.

Results and discussion
Synthesis
The synthetic route to the three dyes QA1–3 containing quinacridone moiety is depicted in Scheme 2. The octyl attached to the quinacridone group can improve the solubility, forming a tightly packed insulating monolayer blocking the I3− or cations from approaching the TiO2 and enhancing the open circuit voltage. The synthesis of QA1–3 was started from a commercially available quinacridone precursor. The N-alkylation of quinacridone gave 1, in which the bromination of 1 with N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) provided compound 2 in good yield. Asymmetrical Suzuki coupling reaction of compound 2 with 4-(diphenylamino)phenyl-boronic acid and 4-(bis(4-methoxyphenyl)-amino)phenyl-boronic acid gave compounds 3 and 5, respectively. Heck reaction of 2 with N,N-diphenyl-4-vinylaniline provided compound 4. In the next step, Suzuki coupling of 3–5 with 5-formyl-2-furanylboronic acid afforded mono-aldehyde substituted precursors 6–8, respectively. Finally, the target products (QA1–3) were obtained via Knoevenagel condensation reaction of the respective aldehydes with 2-cyanoacetic acid in the presence of ammonium acetate. All the intermediates and target dyes were confirmed by standard spectroscopic methods.

Spectroscopic properties of QA1–3 in solution and adsorbed on TiO2 films
The UV-Vis absorption spectra of the three dyes QA1–3 in THF solutions and on TiO2 films are shown in Fig. 1, and their absorption data are listed in Table 1. In the UV-Vis spectra in Fig. 1a, these dyes exhibit three major prominent bands, appearing at 300–390 nm, 400–500 nm, and 520–570 nm, respectively. The former shows typical triarylamine absorption peaks at 350/388/352 nm in THF,19 respectively, in which the peak of QA2 at 388 nm shows about a 40 nm red-shift because of the conjugation between triphenylamine and vinyl. The middle band of QA1–3 is ascribed to a localized aromatic π–π* transition of quinacridone with furan and the terminal cyanoacrylic acid group, in which QA1–3 show an absorption peak at around 446 nm in THF. It is demonstrated by the measurement of the UV-Vis absorption of the intermediates 1,3,5-(9-bromo-5,12-dioctyl-7,14-dioxo-5,7,12,14-tetrahydroquinolino[2,3-b]acridin-2-yl)furan-2-carbaldehyde (a), 3-(5-(9-bromodioctyl-7,14-dioxo-5,7,12,14-tetrahydroquinolino-[2,3,5,12-b]acridin-2-yl)furan-2-yl)-2-cyanoacrylic acid (b) and QA1 in THF solutions (Fig. S1†). Meanwhile, time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) calculations were carried out with the solvent effects of THF taken into account by the polarizable continuum model (PCM). The PBE0 functional was used together with the 6-31G* basis set (Table S1 and S2†). The largest oscillator strengths (f) around 450 nm correspond to excitation from HOMO−1 to LUMO. The molecular orbital image shows that the transition is consistent with our experimental attribution.

The bands at around 520–570 nm can be attributed to the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) between the triarylamine donor and the acceptor. For the charge-transfer band, the absorption maxima for QA1–3 in THF are at 534 nm, 540 nm and 539 nm, respectively. Compared with QA1 and QA3, QA2 has a vinyl group between triphenylamine and the QA moiety, which enhanced the extent of electron delocalization over the whole molecule, so its maximum absorption peak was red shifted. At the same time the absorption band of QA3 shows a slight red-shift compared with QA1 due to the effect of the two methoxy groups attached to the triphenylamine on the electron donor side. It is worth noting that the corresponding maximum extinction coefficients of the three dyes at around 446 nm are higher than that of the band at around 540 nm, in which they are 5.12 × 104, 4.34 × 104 and 3.28 × 104 M−1 cm−1, respectively. In comparison with conventional ruthenium complexes (for example, 1.39 × 104 M−1 cm−1 at 541 nm for N3),39 the present dye molecules show about three times higher absorption coefficients. A corresponding thinner nanocrystalline film is allowed owing to the greater maximum absorption coefficients of the organic dyes, which could be beneficial for DSSCs with an ionic liquid electrolyte for better conversion efficiencies.4

Fig. 1b shows the absorption spectra of QA1–3 on 7 μm transparent TiO2 films after 10 h adsorption. Compared to the spectrum in THF solution, the absorption peaks for QA1–3 on TiO2 films are blue-shifted by 30, 3 and 15 nm, respectively. Generally, due to the strong attractive force between the molecules, they have a strong tendency to aggregate in solution or at the solid–liquid interface when the sensitizers are adsorbed onto a nanocrystalline TiO2 surface. Dye aggregates usually have three forms: red-shifted J-aggregates, blue-shifted H-aggregates and both red- and blue-shifted herring-bone aggregates.40 The experimental results indicate that QA1–3 used in this work form H-aggregates on the TiO2 nanocrystal surface. On the other hand, after the sensitizer molecule adsorbs on TiO2 film, the decreased electron-withdrawing ability of the acceptor (cynaoacrylic acid group) can also cause the blue-shifted absorption spectra. Therefore, the blue-shifted absorption spectra of the dyes on TiO2 are attributed to the H-aggregates and deprotonation of the carboxylic acid. In addition, it is noteworthy that the absorption spectra of those dyes anchored onto transparent TiO2 show an obviously broad profile, which is beneficial for light-harvesting.
Electrochemical properties of QA1–3
To evaluate the possibility of electron transfer from the excited dye to the conduction band (CB) of TiO2, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels are usually employed by means of cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements of these dyes. The CV measurements of QA1–3 were performed in tetrahydrofuran solution, using 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate as the supporting electrolyte, Pt as the counter electrode and a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as the reference electrode. Two sets of measurement were carried out for comparison, one employing TiO2 films stained with sensitizers as the working electrode and the other with the sensitizer dissolved in THF solution. The SCE reference electrode was calibrated using a ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) redox couple as an external standard and the E1/2 of the Fc/Fc+ redox couple was found to be 0.56 V versus the SCE reference electrode. The potentials versus NHE were calibrated by the addition of 0.63 V to the potentials versus Fc/Fc+.7 Therefore, the potentials measured vs. SCE were converted to normal hydrogen electrode (NHE) by the addition of 0.07 V. The voltammetric results are presented in Fig. S2†, and the data on the films are collected in Table 1. The first half-wave potentials of QA1–3 on the films are 0.99 V, 0.92 V and 0.76 V (vs. SCE). Therefore, the HOMO levels of QA1–3 corresponding to their first redox potential are 1.06 V, 0.99 V and 0.83 V vs. NHE, respectively, which are much more positive than the iodine/iodide redox potential value (0.4 V vs. NHE), ensuring that there is enough driving force for the efficient dye regeneration through the recapture of the injected electrons from I− by the dye cationic radical. The excitation transition energy (E0–0) of QA1–3 is estimated from their absorption thresholds of dye-sensitized TiO2 films to be 2.03 V, 1.99 V and 2.01 V, respectively. The estimated excited state potentials corresponding to the LUMO levels of QA1–3, calculated from EHOMO − E0–0, are −0.97 V, −1.00 V and −1.18 V vs. NHE, respectively. Thanks to the more negative LUMO values of the three dyes compared to the bottom of the conduction band of TiO2 (−0.5 V vs. NHE), the electron injection process from the excited dye molecule to the TiO2 conduction band is energetically permitted.
To scrutinize the electronic properties of these dyes further, the optimized structures and electron distribution of the HOMOs and LUMOs of QA1–3 performed by density functional theory (DFT) at the B3LYP/6-31G* level in the gas phase are shown in Table S3 and S4†, respectively. The theoretical calculations show that the dihedral angle between the quinacridone ring and the furan ring is less than 1 degree, which is beneficial for intramolecular charge transfer. As shown in Table S4†, the HOMOs in QA1–3 are primarily located on the π-framework of the donor part (triphenylamine), while the electron density of the LUMOs is delocalized over the furan group and anchoring group. Thus, the electron distribution from the donor unit to the anchoring moiety can be moved by excitation from the HOMO to the LUMO orbital to realize electron injection into the conduction band of TiO2.
Photovoltaic performances of DSSCs based on QA1–3
The DSSCs were prepared by using a dye-absorbed TiO2 electrode, Pt-coated glass as the counter electrode, and an acetonitrile solution with iodine (0.05 M), lithium iodide (0.1 M), 1,2-dimethyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide (0.6 M), and 4-tert-butylpyridine (0.5 M) as the electrolyte. Fig. 2a shows the incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) as a function of incident wavelength for DSSCs based on these dyes. The solar cells based on QA1–3 show high IPCEs above 60% in the range of 450–605 nm and with the highest values of 83% at 570 nm for QA1, 77% at 550 nm for QA2 and 75% at 535 nm for QA3, respectively. Meanwhile the IPCE values for QA1–3 are obviously decreased at 610 to 680 nm, which is in accordance with their absorption spectra on the TiO2 film. However, compared to the absorption spectra of sensitized films, the IPCE spectra are broadened significantly. The scattering effect of the large particles in the film and the reflective effect of the Pt counter electrode can be considered as reasonable interpretations.13 The IPCE of QA1 is higher than those of QA2 and QA3 in the region from 400 nm to 605 nm, though the IPCE values of QA1 compared to QA2 and QA3 are slightly lower in the region of 610–680 nm, indicating that the QA1 sensitized TiO2 electrode would generate a higher conversion yield among the three dyes.

Fig. 2b shows the current–voltage characteristics of the DSSCs fabricated with QA1–3 as sensitizers under standard global AM 1.5 solar light conditions. The detailed parameters of short-circuit current density (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (FF), and photovoltaic conversion efficiency (η) are summarized in Table 2. Generally, Jsc is related to the molar extinction coefficient of the dye molecule, in which a higher molar extinction coefficient has good light-harvesting ability and yields a higher short circuit, correspondingly. QA1 dye has the highest light harvesting efficiency and consequently an improved Jsc due to the largest molar extinction coefficient. It is noteworthy that all of the three dyes have higher open circuit voltages (Voc) (773–794 mV) than N719 (726 mV) measured under the same conditions. The reason is that the introduction of two hydrophobic alkyl chains into the quinacridone rings can act as barriers preventing hydrophilic I3− from approaching the TiO2 surface, inhibiting charge recombination and thus improving Voc. QA2-based DSSCs show a lower Voc (773 mV) than QA1 and QA3-based DSSCs. One plausible explanation is that the extended conjugation and good planarity can enhance the charge recombination and result in a lower Voc,41,42 The dark current–voltage characteristics also agree well with the Voc values, in which the quinacridone-bridged dyes’ dark current onset potential shifted to a larger value than N719. DSSCs based on QA1 exhibit the best overall light to electricity conversion efficiency of 6.80% (Jsc = 12.42 mA cm−2, Voc = 776 mV, FF = 0.71) under AM 1.5 irradiation (100 mW cm−2), which reached 87% with respect to that of an N719-based device fabricated under similar conditions.

Due to strong intermolecular interactions, π–π stacking of organic dye molecules usually occurs, causing inefficient electron injection and low power conversion efficiency.43 It has been demonstrated that co-adsorption of co-adsorbents with dye molecules which suffer from aggregation can improve solar cell performance significantly.10 Since QA1 exhibits the best performance among the three dyes studied in this work, we focus on the optimization of QA1-based DSSCs using a co-adsorption strategy, and the data are summarized in Table 2 (the I–V curves are shown in Fig. S3†). As shown in Fig. S3†, the short-circuit photocurrent (Jsc) of QA1-based DSSC increases from 12.42 to 13.25 mA cm−2 with 10 and 20 mM CDCA, respectively, and then slightly decreases with further increasing CDCA to 30 mM. One explanation is that the amount of adsorbed dye on the TiO2 surface is reduced by the co-adsorbents of CDCA (as shown in Fig. S4†), resulting in a loss in light harvesting and thus a decreased short-circuit photocurrent. The open-circuit voltage in the DSSCs with QA1 is improved, indicating that the charge recombination process is effectively prohibited in the presence of CDCA. Resulting from the co-grafting of the two molecules, the formation of a mixed mono-layer should be more tightly packed than when the sensitizer is absorbed alone, providing an insulating barrier against back electron transfer more effectively from the TiO2 conduction band to the electrolyte.43,44 As shown in Table 2, the highest power conversion efficiency could be obtained at 20 mM CDCA, in which QA1 achieved an overall conversion efficiency of 7.70% (Jsc = 13.25 mA cm−2, Voc = 804 mV, FF = 0.73).
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis is considered as a powerful tool to elucidate the electronic and ionic transport processes in DSSCs. Fig. 3 shows the EIS for DSSCs based on dyes QA1–3 and 20 mM CDCA co-adsorbed DSSCs based on dye QA1 under a forward bias of −0.70 V from 0.1 Hz to 100 KHz in the dark. As shown in Fig. 3a, the Nyquist diagram shows two semicircles in the measured frequency range, in which the larger semicircle located in the low-frequency region is assigned to the dark reaction impedance caused by charge transportation at the TiO2–dye–electrolyte interface, and the other smaller semicircle located in the high-frequency region is attributed to the charge-transfer at the counter electrode.45,46 The radius of the larger semicircle increases in the order QA2 < QA1 < QA3, indicating that the electron recombination resistance increases from QA2, QA1, QA3. This result is in agreement with the observed shift in the Voc value under standard global AM 1.5 illumination and in the dark. With an optimized dye QA1 to be co-adsorbed with 20 mM CDCA, the QA1-based DSSCs show a larger semicircle after co-sensitization, which is reflected in the improvement shown in the Voc.
 Fig. 3  Impedance spectra of untreated DSSCs based on dyes QA1–3 and 20 mM CDCA co-adsorbed DSSCs based on dye QA1 measured at −0.70 V bias in the dark. (a) Nyquist plots; (b) Bode phase plots. 

Fig. 3b shows the Bode plots of the DSSCs based on QA1–3. All EIS Bode plots exhibit two peak features for the frequency investigated. The one at higher frequency corresponds to charge transfer at the Pt/electrolyte interface and meanwhile the other one at lower frequency corresponds to thecharge transfer at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface, which is related to the charge recombination rate and whose reciprocal is associated with the electron lifetime.47 In Fig. 3b, the low frequency peak of QA3 shows a lower frequency than those of QA1 and QA2, indicating that QA3-based DSSCs have longer electron lifetimes, which leads to a lower rate of charge recombination. The electron lifetime values of QA1–3 are 54.9 ms, 43.0 ms and 66.3 ms, respectively, likewise supporting the observed shift in the Voc value under standard global AM 1.5 illumination and in the dark. Due to the slight blocking effect of the methoxy group, QA3 based DSSCs show a higher Voc than QA1 and QA2 based DSSCs, as a result of the enhanced electron lifetime. After co-sensitization with CDCA, the low frequency peak of QA1 shows a lower frequency than before, and this indicates that the 20 mM CDCA co-sensitized QA1-based cell has a longer electron lifetime (79.6 ms), which leads to a lower rate of charge recombination and thus an improved Voc.
Long-term stability measurements of ionic liquid electrolyte based DSSCs
Long-term stability is considered as an important parameter for sustained cell operation for applications in the future. Hence, due to low volatility and high thermal stability, ionic-liquid based electrolytes are a better choice.48 The DSSCs were prepared using 0.1 M iodine, 0.1 M lithium iodide, 0.45 M benzimidazole in 1-propyl-3-methyl imidazolium iodide as the redox electrolyte. The photovoltaic performances of QA1–3 sensitized TiO2 film electrodes with a solvent-free ionic liquid electrolyte under standard global AM 1.5 solar light conditions (100 mW cm−2) are shown in Fig. S5† and summarized in Table S5†. In accordance with DSSCs based on liquid electrolytes, the photovoltaic parameters of the QA1 based DSSCs with ionic-liquid electrolytes show best performance of 4.28% (Jsc = 10.60 mA cm−2, Voc = 640 mV, FF = 0.63). The Jsc, Voc and FF show little change over 1000 h in Fig. 4. Moreover, Fig. 4 reveals that the DSSCs based on QA1–3 with an ionic-liquid electrolyte remained at 96%, 97%, 98% of the initial overall efficiency value after 1000 h of visible-light soaking, respectively, which could demonstrate the good stability of DSSCs based on quinacridone sensitizers.

Conclusion
In conclusion, three new metal-free quinacridone-based organic dyes with a furan unit (QA1–3) were conveniently prepared and characterized. It was found that the introduction of the triphenylamine group as the electron-donor brought about improved photovoltaic performance compared with methoxytriphenylamine and N,N-diphenyl-4-vinylbenzenamine for quinacridone dyes. Co-adsorption of CDCA can break up the dye aggregates, leading to an increase of the photocurrent density, and suppressing charge recombination, leading to increasing electron lifetimes and thus photovoltage. A maximum solar energy to electricity conversion efficiency of 7.70% (Jsc = 13.25 mA cm−2, Voc = 804 mV, FF = 0.73) under simulated AM 1.5 solar light irradiation (100 mW cm−2) with a 20 mM CDCA co-adsorbed DSSC based on QA1 was obtained. Most importantly, the long-term stability of the quinacridone DSSCs with ionic-liquid electrolytes under 1000 h light-soaking was demonstrated. The quinacridone moiety and the furan ring have excellent planarity from the DFT calculations. In addition, as an alternative to thiophene, the furan ring can be advantageously incorporated into dye-sensitizers as a π-spacer and can improve the cell efficiency and stability. Our findings demonstrate that quinacridone-based organic sensitizers with a furan moiety are promising for the further improvement of the conversion efficiency of DSSCs owing to the original and versatile molecular design.
