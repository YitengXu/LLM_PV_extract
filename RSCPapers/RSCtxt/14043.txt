Herein, we report on p and n type tin oxides thin films as functional TCOs with photon management properties through doping with Nd3+ rare earth ions. We show that the structure, composition, carrier transport and optical properties of the sputtered Nd:SnOx films can be easily tuned by simply varying the Ar/O2 gas flow ratio (R) during the deposition step. The increase of the oxygen content leads to drastic changes of the material properties from p-type SnO to n-type SnO2. Furthermore, all Nd:SnOx films are found to be highly conductive with resistivities as low as 1 × 10−3 Ω cm−1 and carrier mobilities up to 129 cm2 V−1 s−1. Thanks to deep XPS and NEXAFS spectroscopies, we gained insight into the coordination and oxidation degrees of the elements within the matrices. The insertion and optical activation of the incorporated Nd3+ ions have been successfully achieved in both matrices. As a consequence, strong NIR luminescence lines, typical of Nd3+ ions, were recorded under UV laser excitation. We experimentally show that the efficient Nd3+ photoluminescence in the near infrared region originates from efficient sensitization from the host matrix, through energy transfer. We found that the SnO2 host matrix provides more efficient sensitization of Nd3+ as compared to the SnO matrix. An energy transfer mechanism is proposed to explain the observed behaviour.
Introduction
In the past few decades, rare earth (RE)-doped wide band gap semiconductors have been considered as a new class of materials due to their interesting optical and magnetic properties that have opened the door for a wide range of potential applications. Thus, flat panel display technology has stimulated research on visible light emitting REs such as Tb, Eu, Pr and Sm. In the same vein, REs such as Nd, Yb, Er and Eu involving near-infrared (NIR) luminescence have stirred exceptional interest for electroluminescent devices, fiber amplifiers, fluorescent lamps and semiconductor lasers.1–4 Beyond their optical properties, these materials have been successfully involved in the telecommunication, imaging, biomedical and solar energy fields.5–10
As for the conversion of solar energy into electric power, photon conversion layers containing RE elements can be placed on top of solar cells in order to split the high energy UV photons into low energy NIR photons useful to the cells. Consequently, thermalization losses are considerably reduced and the cell efficiency can be markedly enhanced, thanks to the intra 4f transitions of the rare earth elements.10
Most often, the light emission from RE lanthanides (Ln) elements is obtained via a host sensitization. The host should be able to efficiently absorb the incident high-energy photons and then transfer them to Ln3+ through resonant transitions. Most of the studies based on Ln3+ doped semiconductor oxides have been focussing on ZnO and TiO2 while only few publications report on tin oxides.11–13 More recently, SnO2 as alternative matrix, has caught increasing attention due to its particularly interesting properties.11–13 Indeed, compared to other semiconductor oxides, SnO2 has a wide band gap around 3.6 eV for the bulk material,14 and a high exciton binding energy of 130 meV, making it an attractive matrix for electrically activated emissions.15 Moreover, this material combines high transparency in the visible light range (above 90%) with strong reflectivity in the infrared region.16 Taking into advantage its high concentration of native oxygen defects acting as donors in the undoped form, SnO2 exhibits good electrical n-type conductivity along with a high carrier concentration. Compared to SnO2, SnO also possesses a wide band gap that ranges between 2.7 and 3.4 eV.17,18 However, it exhibits a p-type conductivity,17 which can be converted to n-type by doping with Sb19 for instance. Interestingly, demands on p-type semiconducting materials with good transport properties are particularly increasing in recent decade given their potential, especially in optoelectronic technology.
Earlier pioneering studies on SnO2 doped RE3+, particularly with Er, Eu, Sm and Ce shed new light on the ability of this material to hold and sensitize lanthanides.20–26 Nd-doped SnO2 films grown by electron beam evaporation proposed as optical converter have been reported by Rinnert et al.27 In their work, a high annealing temperature of 700 °C was needed to reach a pure SnO2 phase as well for the optical activation of the dopant. However, the measured carrier mobilities remained small; raising fundamental issues for possible applications in solar cell devices for instance as only few can withstand such high process temperature. Moreover, to the best knowledge of the authors the insertion process of Nd into different SnOx host matrices, in other words the effect of the atomic environment of the dopant as well as its sensitization and optical activation were not explored yet.
In this work, we show that using low sputtering deposition temperature of 100 °C, films such as SnO and SnO2 with excellent electrical properties can be obtained. Moreover, in all structures, the incorporated Nd elements are well inserted. We explore the atomic surroundings of the rare earth by means of XPS and NEXAFS spectroscopies and investigate its optical activity as well as the UV light conversion occurring in the different host matrices. The Nd:SnOx films presented here were produced by reactive magnetron sputtering under variable Ar/O2 gas flow. The correlation between structure, composition and light emission of the functionalized films is reported. We experimentally demonstrate the energy transfer occurring between the hosts SnO and SnO2 and the Nd elements.
Results and discussion
Synthesis of p and n type Nd-doped SnOx thin films
Table 1 gives the measured thickness of the Nd doped SnOx films deposited using an Ar/O2 gas ratio (R) of 2, 3, 3.5 and 4 sccm. The values were deduced from X-ray reflectometry (XRR). The amount of Nd atoms as extracted from Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy (RBS) analyses is found to be about 0.6 ± 0.2 at%, with a homogenous distribution in depth regardless of the gas flow ratio. The deposition rate is found to decrease as more oxygen (lower Ar/O2 ratio) is injected into the deposition chamber.

Fig. 1 plots the valence-band photoemission spectra of the Nd-doped SnOx thin films as a function of the gas ratio R. A closer look to their high resolution XPS valence-band (VB) spectra allows a rapid identification of the most abundant oxide in the films. Indeed, SnO and SnO2 can be unambiguously distinguished through very distinct signals.28,29
 Fig. 1  XPS spectra of the valence-band of the Nd-doped SnOx sputtered thin films versus the Ar/O2 gas flow ratio (R). 
The films deposited with low Ar/O2 ratio (R = 2 and 3) present three distinguished bands. The most prominent one, located at EB = 5 eV (labelled B in Fig. 1), originates from the O 2p derived levels (bonding or nonbonding). The feature at about EB = 8 eV (labelled C) is due to the ppσ hybridization between Sn 5p and O 2p orbitals. The band at about EB = 11 eV (noted D) is mainly derived from bonding Sn 5s–O 2p states.30 For the film deposited with R = 3.5, an additional feature at about EB = 3 eV (named A) appears commonly assigned to antibonding Sn 5s–O 2p states.29 Increasing further the ratio R to 4 (less oxygen incorporated in the deposition chamber) leads to the enhancement of the intensity of band A, to the decrease of the intensities of the other bands, together with a shift of band D towards lower binding energies.
Previous reports by Themlin et al.29 showed that the most notable difference between SnO and SnO2 in the VB spectra is the appearance of the peak at low binding energy of the VB (band A), characteristic of SnO (ref. 31). In fact, these Sn 5s derived levels that form the bottom of the conduction band in SnO2 become part of the occupied states in the top of the valence band in SnO. We can therefore conclude that a SnO structure is achieved with a deposition ratio of R = 4. On the other side, the films made with R = 2 and R = 3 are oxygen rich and their XPS valence-band (VB) spectra fit that of a pure SnO2 structure. Interestingly is the XPS spectrum of the sample made at R = 3.5 which displays the features of both SnO2 and SnO. This behaviour indicates the formation of a structure composed of a mixture of SnO2 and SnO.
Our results show that the decrease of the Ar/O2 flow ratio R from 4 down to 2 leads to a structural change from SnO into SnO2.
Additional surface analyses by Near Edges X-ray Absorption Fine Structure spectroscopy (NEXAFS) can provide information about local bonding environment of the oxygen and tin constituent elements. O 1s and Sn M4,5 NEXAFS spectra were obtained in the total electron yield (TEY) mode (ESI Fig. S1 and S2†). The O 1s absorption lines of the films with R = 3.5 and R = 4 were found to match well with that of the SnO reference, whereas those of the films with R = 2 and R = 3 exhibited a typical SnO2 signal as indicated by the reference. This is unexpected for R = 3.5 if compared to the XPS results shown above.
The Sn M4,5 absorption spectra (ESI Fig. S2†) confirm the SnO structure for R = 4 and the SnO2 structure for R = 2 and 3. As expected, the film made with R = 3.5 is found to behave differently. A chemical shift about 0.7 eV in the Sn M4,5 absorption peak at 491 eV is clearly noticed with respect to the other films, most likely due the presence of a secondary SnO2 phase.
In order to cast further light on the inner structure of the different films, analyses by X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) were performed. Fig. 2 shows the XRD patterns of the SnOx:Nd films with R ranging from 2 up to 4. The film with R = 4 (low oxidating atmosphere) exhibits a broad diffraction band at around 30°, a feature commonly assigned to amorphous or nanocrystalline SnO structure.27,32–35 A similar diffraction pattern is obtained for the film deposited at R = 3.5 but a narrow peak appears at 2θ = 33.9°. This peak is assigned to the (101) plane of the rutile SnO2 phase, indicating a mixture of polycrystalline SnO and SnO2. As for the sample deposited with an Ar/O2 ratio of 3, the XRD pattern displays many well-defined peaks characteristic of polycrystalline tetragonal rutile SnO2 (according to the JCPDS card no. 00-041-1445 of ICDD). The peak located at 26.44° is attributed to the (110) diffraction, and the peaks at 37.98°, 51.74°, 53.92° are assigned to the (200), (211) and (220) planes, respectively.
 Fig. 2  X-ray diffraction patterns of Nd:SnOx films deposited with increasing Ar/O2 gas flow ratio from 2 up to 4. The main peaks are indexed in the rutile SnO2 structure. 
Finally, the XRD pattern of the sample grown with R = 2 also shows a polycrystalline character of SnO2 with a strong texture along the [110] and [200] directions. These XRD data show that crystalline SnO2 rutile phase can be obtained by simply varying the Ar/O2 flow ratio during the sputtering process and at a quite low deposition temperature (100 °C). This is a very interesting result if compared to previous works by Rinnert et al.27 and Pan et al.35 who stated that SnO2 rutile phase could not be achieved without a thermal annealing up to 700 °C.
Moreover, the XRD spectra revealed the presence of a small peak at 24.56° (for the crystalline samples) that corresponds to the signature of SnSiOx ternary phase. As this peak could not be detected on samples grown on quartz substrates (diffraction pattern not shown here), it is most likely that its origin lies in the inter-diffusion of Si and Sn at the film/silicon substrate interface. In addition, no other diffraction peaks corresponding to Sn3O4, metallic Sn, or Nd-based spurious phases could be identified within the detection limit of our XRD technique. The absence of Nd-related compounds in the XRD patterns suggests that Nd atoms are successfully incorporated into the SnOx lattices given the low doping level (<1 at%). Even if there were some amounts of Nd oxides they could not be detected by the XRD technique.
Fig. 3 plots optical transmission spectra of the SnOx:Nd films for different R. The spectra clearly show a change in the optical properties of the films when the Ar/O2 gas flow ratio (R) is varied from 2 up to 4, in agreement with the XPS, NEXAFS and XRD results reported above.
 Fig. 3  Transmission spectra of Nd:SnOx thin films obtained with different Ar/O2 gas flow ratios, R. 
The transmission spectrum of the film obtained with R = 4 suggests an absorption edge at about 400 nm, indicative of a low band gap oxide. This is well in line with the structural analysis reported above which demonstrated the formation of a SnO structure. The films elaborated with R = 2 and 3 show an absorption edge in the 350 nm range, in agreement with that expected for a wide band gap SnO2 oxide. For R = 3.5 the transmission spectrum is shifted towards lower wavelengths owing to the SnO2 secondary phase present in SnO film. These results unveil that SnO films are able to absorb photons with energy higher than 2 eV, while the SnO2 films are transparent to photons with energy lower than 3 eV.
Overall, we can conclude that the decrease of Ar/O2 leads to radical changes in the structure. Thereby three different materials can be easily synthesized: SnO (R = 4), SnO2 (R = 2 and 3) and a mixture of SnO and SnO2 (R = 3.5).
Further analysis of the deposited Nd:SnOx films consist in measuring the electrical properties using a Hall effect room temperature setup working in the van der Pauw configuration. Table 2 gives the carrier concentration n, the electrical resistivity ρ, and the Hall mobility μ as measured on the films for different ratio R.

The increase of oxygen concentration (decrease of R) leads to different electrical properties as the structure changes from SnO to SnO2. Interestingly, low oxygen content in the SnOx:Nd film (R = 4) results in a p-type material, which is consistent with a SnO structure. Hole mobility as high as 54 cm2 V−1 s−1 and resistivity as low as 0.06 Ω cm−1 are recorded. In contrast, the decrease of R down to 3 revealed a n-type conductivity, confirming indirectly the SnO2 phase. For this sample, an electron mobility of 21 cm2 V−1 s−1 and a resistivity about 0.005 Ω cm−1 are reported. By increasing more the oxygen content in the films, the electrical properties improved spectacularly. Thus, mobility exceeding 120 cm2 V−1 s−1 with resistivity as low as 0.001 Ω cm−1 are obtained for R = 2.
These electrical data are in good agreement with the structural and optical results and show markedly that SnOx layers with x varying from 1 to 2 can be obtained by tuning the oxygen flow during sputtering deposition. More interestingly, the carriers properties are very promising for applications as TCOs.
Luminescence properties of the Nd-doped SnOx films
In order to get a glimpse on the optical activity of the rare earth embedded into the different SnOx matrices, photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy was performed. Room temperature PL spectra were recorded over the UV-Vis-NIR range under a He–Cd laser excitation of λ = 325 nm (3.81 eV). The results are displayed in Fig. 4. All films exhibit a broad luminescent band over a large part of the UV-Visible spectrum that ranges from 350 to 700 nm with, however, variable intensities. This UV-Vis emission originates from the host matrix. In contrast, only the oxygen rich SnO2 film (R = 2) displays an optical emission in the Near Infrared (NIR) spectral region, exhibiting three intense and well-defined peaks. This NIR emission is commonly assigned to radiative transitions of the 4f electrons of Nd. We will focus later on these features.
 Fig. 4  Room temperature UV-to-NIR photoluminescence spectra of Nd:SnOx thin films for different gas flow ratios: 2, 3, 3.5, and 4 under an excitation wavelength at 325 nm. 
A closer look to the broad emission band of the SnO film (R = 4) indicates the presence of two contributions, one strong band centered around 430 nm and a second less intense centered around 560 nm. It is found that both of the bands are arising from oxygen vacancies together with tin interstitial atoms and inter-grains related defects.22,36 In fact, oxygen vacancies which are present with a high density in such structure represent the most prominent defects in SnO that can form localized deep levels around the Fermi level. The electrons transitions from these intermediate states to the valence band induce efficient radiative recombinations resulting in the strong emission band recorded in the UV-to-Visible part of the spectrum. Surprisingly, by increasing the oxygen content (R = 3.5), the intensity of this band dramatically decreases suggesting fundamental changes in the defects type.
This behavior is however fully consistent with the film structure composed of a mixture of SnO and SnO2 phases. This means that the non-radiative recombinations, whose origin is multiple, such as point defects, dislocations, grain boundaries, surface/interface states – are prominent relative to the radiative recombinations. By increasing further the oxygen content (R = 3), the defects-band spectacularly increases. The signal of this part of the spectrum was divided by 4 for better viewing purposes. It is worth reminding that at this deposition condition, the structure switched to SnO2. Since the UV-Vis emission for samples R = 4 and R = 3 have similar shape and peak position, we speculate that the radiative recombinations have the same origin (oxygen vacancies) in SnO and SnO2 structures, with however very different densities. In the case of the SnO2 made with R = 2 (the most oxygen rich in this study), a dramatic decrease of the UV-Vis emission is accompanied with the appearance of three strong bands in the NIR region. Indeed, the group emissions located at 885, 1067 and 1340 nm are usually attributed to the 4f electron transitions from the 4F3/2 energy level to the 4In/2 levels of the Nd3+ ions with n equal to 9, 11 and 13, respectively. Moreover, the Nd emission peaks at 885 and 1067 nm are followed by a second less intense band. This originates from the SnO2 crystal field splitting effect of the 4I9/2 and 4I11/2 energy levels, respectively, particularly due the SnO2 crystal field splitting effect. Such narrow and intense photoluminescence peaks give an experimental evidence of the good insertion and the efficient optical activation of the Nd3+ ions into this structure. The absence of Nd-related features for the other oxygen ratios (R = 3, 3.5 and 4) suggests that either the Nd atoms are not inserted into site position or they are not optically active.
To give insight into the coordination and the oxidation degrees of Nd atoms in the different matrices, NEXAFS analyses were performed. The Nd M4,5 NEXAFS experimental spectra are reported in Fig. 5 for different R ratios. MLFT calculations for Nd3+ and Nd4+ are also plotted for comparison.
 Fig. 5  Nd M4,5 NEXAFS measurements of Nd-doped SnOx samples for different gas flow ratios. MLFT calculations for Nd3+ and Nd4+ are included for comparison. 
At first glance, by comparing to Nd3+ and Nd4+ calculated spectra, particularly the M4 absorption peaks, the shape of the experimental spectra matches more closely with Nd3+. The simulated spectra were calculated for atomic Nd3+ and Nd4+ ions in isolated space without considering any crystal field effects from the SnOx lattice, which may change the M4–5 peak splitting. This can explain why the energy positions of peaks in the calculated and measured spectra do not line up. In this case, it is more appropriate to rather consider the spectral shape and number of peaks, mainly at the M4 edge. From the calculated spectra, Nd4+ has four main peaks with a sharp large peak in the centre, while Nd3+ has three well identified peaks. The measurements show a clear three peak structure at the M4 edge, suggesting that the atoms are primarily in the 3+ states. If there were a significant fraction of Nd4+ in the samples, we would expect to see some evidence of the prominent middle peak in the measurements, unless the concentration is too small to be detected.
Fig. 5 clearly shows a chemical shift of the M4,5 lines while the line shape remains unchanged. Since Nd M4,5 NEXAFS measures electron transitions from 3d104fn to 3d94fn+1 state, this chemical shift with similar line shape can be caused by a compensating effect of the shift of Nd 3d level due to different Madelung potential on Nd ion in SnO and SnO2, and the screening of the Nd 3d core-hole potential by free charge, possibly due to oxygen vacancies.37 Indeed, XAS measurements are subject to a core hole in the final state, meaning that the energy position of the unoccupied states is affected by a Coulomb interaction with a positive hole in core electronic states. The effect of this interaction is a shift of the XAS absorption edge. The amount of the shift is also affected by the number of other electrons in the system which have a screening effect to reduce the Coulomb interaction. As stated above, the number of electrons may change due to the number of oxygen vacancies which behave as free charges. The different Madelung potential refers to a different electrostatic energy binding at particular Nd site to its SnOx lattice. Nd ions in different SnOx lattices will be affected by a different electrostatic binding which may shift the M4,5 peak position. This can tune the local bonding environment around Nd dopants without changing their ionic valence. These results can help understanding the PL spectra.
The presence of the 3+ oxidation state feature of Nd indicates that Nd3+ ions are well inserted within the deposited layers regardless of R values and possess an energy level structure as that in LaCl3 crystals. However, it does not mean that the impurity ions are optically active. The local environment of the rare earth ion plays a dominant role on the optical emission of the Nd3+ ions.
In fact, the electric dipole transitions between the intra-4f states are naturally forbidden for the isolated RE ions.7,15 However, this selection rule can be relaxed if one considers the presence of the crystal field, which is responsible for states mixing with different parities. In Judd's work,38 it is shown that the electric dipole transitions within the 4f shells of the RE ions can be permitted only if the RE ions are not positioned in the inversion centre of the lattice. Moreover, due to the parity forbidden of the 4f–4f transitions, the optical absorption cross-section of Ln3+ is quite small, typically in the order of 10−21 cm2. When exciting the luminescent lanthanide ions, their absorption is limited to narrow lines. One effective way to overcome this problem is sensitization by/via a host matrix through an energy transfer. Large bandgap semiconductors such as ZnO, TiO2, In2O3 (ref. 21 and 39–41) and here SnOx are potential candidates. The overall process is somehow complicated and involves several mechanisms and energy levels.
Clarifying the sensitization process and identifying the exact origin of the efficient photoluminescence lines, particularly those recorded for the SnO2 oxygen rich film are some of the scopes of this work. In order to have a deeper insight on the optical activity of the rare earth, PL excitation spectroscopy (PLE) was carried out for the two extreme structures, namely for R = 4 (SnO structure) and R = 2 (SnO2 structure) films. The Nd emission intensity measured at 885 nm is carefully recorded while varying the excitation wavelength from 250 to 650 nm. The results are presented in Fig. 6.
 Fig. 6  Room temperature photoluminescence intensity of Nd:SnOx thin films with R = 2 (SnO2) and R = 4 (SnO) recorded at 885 nm while varying the excitation wavelength from 250 to 650 nm. 
The PL emission under excitation in the 250–450 nm range exhibits spectra with strong differences in intensity between the SnO2 (R = 2) and SnO (R = 4) samples, in addition to a blue shift. In contrast, the emission spectra obtained under excitation in the visible (450–650 nm) exhibit comparable peak positions for SnO2 and SnO samples but with a slight reduced PL intensity for the second one. The bands correspond to emissions resulting from direct excitation of 4f electrons of Nd3+ from the 4I9/2 ground state to higher energy levels (Fig. 7). The emissions centered around 463, 475 nm corresponds to the 4G11/2 and 4G9/2 energy levels. The emission group at 512 and 526 nm coincides with the 2G9/2 and 4G7/2 levels, while the emission under excitation at 573 and 585 nm belongs to the 2G7/2 and 4G5/2 levels, respectively. Yet, the energy level positions of these emissions are found to be slightly shifted when compared to the expected ones for an ideal LaCl3 crystal. This can be understood in term of the crystal field effect since the position of the rare earth electronic levels is influenced by spin–orbit interactions.15
 Fig. 7  Energy transfer mechanisms and transitions occurring between SnO2 (left) and SnO (right) matrix and Nd3+ ions. 
Given the PLE response in the visible range, we infer that Nd3+ ions are optically active in both SnO and SnO2 matrices. However, the overall recorded PL intensity in this region is much weaker than that collected under UV excitation (see y scales), especially for the SnO2 sample. Interestingly, we have found that the emission spectrum of Nd in SnO2 structure matches with its optical absorption at wavelengths below 450 nm (see Fig. 4). The presence of PL emission in both UV and visible parts suggests an efficient resonant energy transfer from the host SnO2 matrix to the Nd3+ ions. Such process is schematically illustrated in Fig. 7. The energy transfer can occur in different ways. A 4f electron of Nd3+ can be efficiently excited from the 4I9/2 ground state to higher energy levels thanks to (i) the exciton recombination resulting from the band to band transitions, or (ii) through transition from localized states created by oxygen vacancies near the conduction band to the valence band.
As for the SnO sample (R = 4), despite the strong absorption of the structure in a wide UV wavelengths range, only a weak Nd emission was collected under excitation with high-energy UV photons (λ < 300 nm). This is in accordance with the absence of Nd response in the PL spectra recorded under 325 nm excitation wavelength (Fig. 5). By comparing the emission intensities of Fig. 6 over the whole wavelength range, we find that in the SnO structure both direct and indirect excitation of Nd3+ ions have comparable probabilities. In the case of SnO2, the indirect excitation is markedly about 20 times stronger relative to the indirect one, indicating the importance of the sensitization through the host matrix. Since the SnO host matrix has a small band gap with a p-type character, the recombination of excitons during the UV excitation step will involve high energy levels above the conduction band and some localized defect states near the valence band. Overall, our PL and PLE results show that UV photons are successfully converted into NIR photons, thanks to the intra-4f transitions of the RE ions present in the SnO2 host matrix.
Conclusions
Low temperature grown Nd-doped SnOx thin films were successfully fabricated by RF magnetron sputtering by varying the Ar/O2 gas flow R. Experiments such as XPS, NEXAFS, XRD and UV-Vis-NIR reveal that the crystalline structure and composition can be easily modulated by tuning R values. Thus, different Nd hosting SnOx matrices can be synthesized: SnO, SnO2, or a mixture of SnOx. Hall-effect measurements revealed that p-type SnO and n-type rutile SnO2 can be produced by choosing the appropriate R value. Thanks to the PLE measurements, we demonstrate experimentally that the strong Nd3+ PL originates from an efficient resonant energy transfer from the host matrix. In particular we found that SnO2 is a better and more efficient sensitizer than SnO. When the host matrix SnO2 absorbs UV light, it efficiently sensitizes the Nd3+ ions. We have proposed an energy band diagram to explain the energy transfer process for this Nd:SnOx films. The electrical and optical properties of the sputtered Nd:SnO2 thin films can most likely be for valuable use as a photon converter for organic and inorganic solar cells.
Experimental
Synthesis
p-Type Si (100) and glass substrates were used for depositing the Nd:SnOx films. Prior to deposition, the silicon substrates were cleaned using H2SO4/H2O2/H2O solution to remove organic contaminants, followed by an HF dip step to etch any oxides formed on the substrate surface. The glass pieces were cleaned by ethanol, DI water and dried under N2 gas flow. The samples were then transferred directly to the deposition chamber of an Orion 3 RF (Radio-Frequency) reactive magnetron sputtering system from AJA International Co. The Sn target was covered with small discs of pure Nd (99.99%). Argon and oxygen gas were introduced in the sputtering chamber. The flow ratio of Ar/O2 gas mixture was varied from 2 to 4 in order to tune the oxygen content x in the SnOx host matrix. For all depositions, the target–substrate distance was kept at about 12 cm. The working pressure and RF power were set at 3.4 mTorr and 50 W, respectively. The deposition temperature was 100 °C. The substrate holder was rotating in order to insure an improved homogeneity of the layers.
Characterization
The XRD analysis of the deposited films were analysed using a Rigaku Smartlab® X-ray diffractometer with a CuKα1 radiation (45 kV, 200 mA, λ = 0.154056 nm) and in a 2θ range of 20–67°. Before each measurement, a systematic calibration on the Si (400) peak was performed. The films thickness and the Nd doping concentration in the deposited films were determined using X-ray reflectometry (XRR) and Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy (RBS) techniques. X-ray photoelectron (XPS) measurements were performed by mean of a Thermo Electron K-Alpha spectrometer using a monochromatic Al-Kα X-ray source (1486.6 eV). The calibration was carried out using Cu and Au (Au 4f7/2 at 84.0 eV) samples following the ASTM-E-902-94 standard procedure. The acquisition parameters were 400 μm spot size, 12 kV primary energy, 6.0 mA emission intensity, CAE 50 eV and 0.1 eV energy step size. The spectra were taken in several points to check the homogeneity of the surface, and no significant differences were observed. Element-specific near edge X-ray absorption fine structure NEXAFS measurements at Nd M4,5, Sn M4,5 and O 1s edges were performed at the Resonant Elastic-Inelastic X-ray Scattering (REIXS) beamline of the Canadian Light Source. NEXAFS spectra were measured in total electron yield mode which probes the upper layers of the sample surface. The spectra were normalized to the incoming photon flux as recorded by Au mesh, and intensity normalized to a constant background as follows: Nd M4,5 at 1020 eV, Sn M4,5 at 510 eV, and O 1s at 565 eV. Ab initio calculations to simulate Nd M4,5 NEXAFS were computed using a multi ligand field theory (MLFT) code using a single impurity Anderson model, which may include multiplet effects, crystal field splittings, and hybridization with ligands.42,43 The simulations employ a model Hamiltonian approach where adjustable parameters are fit to the experiment. In this case spectra for atomic Nd3+ and Nd4+ were simulated without a crystal field, with the Slater integrals scaled to 70% of their Hartree–Fock values. The optical transmission of the films was investigated in the 200–850 nm range using a Perkin Elmer Lambda 950 spectrometer working in the ultraviolet-visible-near infrared (UV-Vis-NIR) range. The resistivity, the carrier concentration and mobility were measured at room temperature using an ECOPIA Hall effect measurement system. Finally, the photoluminescence (PL) measurements of the Nd doped SnO2 thin films were performed using a He–Cd laser excitation source emitting at 325 nm. The signals were recorded at room temperature in the 360–1000 nm range by means of a CCD camera with an acquisition time between 10 and 20 s. The applied power was chosen to 10 mW. The PL signal in the 800–1500 nm range was analysed by using a monochromator equipped with a 600 grooves per nm grating and by using an InP/InGAs photo-multiplier tube cooled at 190 K.
