    , Accepted 25th April 2013First published on 26th April 2013AbstractThree novel organic sensitizers incorporating a planar 4,4-dimethyl-4H-indeno[1,2-b]thiophene or 4,4-dimethyl-4H-indeno[1,2-b]thienothiophene in the bridged group have been designed and synthesized for use in gel-state dye-sensitized solar cells. The photovoltaic performance is quite sensitive to the bridged unit. The optimized cell in JK-276 using a gel electrolyte gave a short circuit photocurrent density of 16.61 mA cm−2, an open circuit voltage of 0.69 V and a fill factor of 0.72, affording an overall conversion efficiency of 8.31% under standard global AM 1.5 solar cell conditions. The efficiency is close to the value of the liquid-state cell (8.40%). The gel-electrolyte cell of JK-276 showed an excellent long-term stability, which remained almost unchanged during the 300 h light soaking test at 70 °C.
Introduction
The development of clean alternatives to current silicon-based solar cells is important in order to protect the global environment and sustain economic growth.1 Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are one of the promising candidates for an alternative form of the solar cell.2 Efficient DSSCs have achieved power conversion efficiencies above 11–12% using a liquid electrolyte such as I−/I3− or CoII/CoIII redox couple.3,4 However, DSSCs that employ such liquid electrolytes have many drawbacks, such as leakage, evaporation of the volatile solvent and corrosion of the Pt counter-electrode by the I−/I3− redox couple, limiting the long-term performance. To solve these problems, extensive studies have been attempted to substitute liquid electrolytes with solid-state or quasi-solid-state electrolytes such as gel electrolytes incorporating redox couples,5 organic6 or inorganic hole conductors,7 and polymer electrolytes.8 Among these alternatives, polymer gel electrolytes appear to be excellent candidates in terms of high conversion efficiency and thermal stability, which are prepared by trapping liquid electrolytes in polymer chains formed in a three-dimensional network of a polymer. Many kinds of polymers or co-polymers have been used as gelators such as poly(acrylonitrile-co-vinyl acetate) (PAN-VA),9 poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA),10 poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG),11 and poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF-HFP).12 Recently, Lee and co-workers9a reported that the gel-state DSSC can achieve a conversion efficiency of 9.03% using the PAN-VA gelator and Ru sensitizer. We also reported a conversion efficiency of 7.4% for a DSSC based on an organic sensitizer and a PVDF-HFP based polymer gel electrolyte.13 Many researchers have attempted to increase the conversion efficiency of gel-state DSSCs based on organic sensitizers.14 However, the efficiencies reported in the literature are less than 7.5%. Thus, considerable efforts have been made to develop efficient organic sensitizers with high efficiencies that also meet the stability criteria. Successful molecular engineering was achieved by incorporating long alkyl chains into the organic framework in order to suppress the aggregation of dye molecules and introducing the rigidification of π-conjugated linkers,15 which not only increased the conversion efficiency but also exhibited excellent stability. Herein, we report three meticulously designed organic sensitizers, coded as JK-274, JK275, and JK-276 (Fig. 1). We also investigated the effect of bridged structural modifications on the power conversion efficiency and long-term stability using the polymer gel electrolyte.

Result and discussion
Synthesis of the sensitizers
The organic sensitizers JK-275 and JK-276 were prepared by the stepwise synthetic protocol in Scheme 1. The bis(7-heptyl-9,9-dimethyl-9H-fluoren-2-yl)amine 3 was synthesized from the reaction of (7-heptyl-9,9-dimethyl-9H-fluoren-2-yl)amine 1 and 2-heptyl-7-iodo-9,9-dimethyl-9H-fluorene 2. N-Phenylation of 6-bromo-4,4-dimethyl-4H-indeno[1,2-b]thiophene or 6-bromo-4,4-dimethyl-4H-indeno[1,2-b]thienothiophene with 3 was performed by the Buchwald reaction.16 The bromo thiophenyl derivatives 4 and 5 were synthesized by bromination of 6 and 7 with NBS in CH2Cl2. The Suzuki coupling reaction17 of 6 and 7 with 5-formylthiophene-2-yl boronic acid yielded 8 and 9. The aldehydes 8 and 9, upon reaction with cyanoacetic acid in the presence of piperidine in CH3CN and CHCl3, produced the sensitizers JK-275 and JK-276. To assess the merit of planar linker units, we also prepared their counterpart JK-274 incorporating a bithiophene bridge for reference.

Photophysical properties

Fig. 2 shows the absorption and emission spectra of sensitizers JK-274, JK-275, and JK-276 in THF and the data are listed in Table 1. The absorption spectrum of the reference dye JK-274 displays two absorption maxima at 368 nm and 467 nm. The absorption band at 368 nm could be assigned to the π–π* transition, which is characterized as the HOMO → LUMO+2 excitation (f = 0.79). The absorption band observed at 467 nm results from ICT originating in a mixture of HOMO → LUMO (f = 0.65) and HOMO−1 → LUMO excitations (f = 1.05). Under the same conditions, the JK-275 containing the planar indeno[1,2-b]thiophene unit exhibits absorption maxima at 373 nm and 483 nm. The introduction of a planar unit in JK-275 instead of the bridged thiophene unit in the reference dye JK-274 caused a significant red shift of 16 nm. The molar extinction coefficient at the maximum absorption band is significantly enhanced from 39800 M−1 cm−1 in JK-274 to 56900 M−1 cm−1 in JK-275 through the rigidification of π-linker. The bathochromic and hyperchromic effects of JK-275 relative to JK-274 derive from an increased delocalization over an entire conjugated system by the introduction of the planar indeno[1,2-b]thiophene unit. When the JK-275 sensitizer was adsorbed on a TiO2 electrode, a significant red shift was observed due to the J-aggregation on the TiO2 electrode. The absorption spectra of the three dyes on the TiO2 electrode are much broadened. Such a broadening of the absorption spectrum is attributable to an interaction between the dyes and TiO2.18

Redox behavior of dyes
To evaluate the energy match for electron transfer from the excited state of the dye to the conduction band of the TiO2 electrode as well as charge transfer from the redox couple to oxidized sensitizer, redox potentials of the three sensitizers were evaluated by cyclic voltammetry in CH3CN with 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate. The three organic sensitizers adsorbed on TiO2 films showed a quasi-reversible oxidation potential (JK-274: 1.28 V; JK-275: 1.16 V; JK-276: 1.14 V). The oxidation potentials of three sensitizers decrease in the order JK-274 > JK-275 > JK-276, reflecting an increased electron donating character of the employed indeno[1,2-b]thiophene in JK-275 and indeno[1,2-b]thienothiophene in JK-276. The LUMOs of the three sensitizers were calculated using the oxidation potential and E0–0 values were determined from the intersection of absorption and emission spectra. The excited-state oxidation potentials (E*ox) of the dyes (JK-274: −1.01 V; JK-275: −1.05 V; JK-276: −1.06 V) are more negative than the conduction band potential of TiO2 at −0.5 V vs. NHE, providing the thermodynamic driving force for electron injection.19
Theoretical calculations of electronic properties
We performed DFT/TDDFT calculations to gain insight into the nature of the electronic absorption origin. Fig. 3 presents the electron density plots of the frontier molecular orbital of the three sensitizers. The calculation illustrates that the HOMO of the three sensitizers is localized on the triphenyl amino group. The LUMO is delocalized over the cyanoacrylic unit with a sizable population on the next thiophene unit. The examination of HOMO–LUMO of the three sensitizers indicates that the HOMO–LUMO excitation moved the electron distribution from the triphenyl amino unit to the cyanoacrylic acid unit. Therefore, the photoinduced electron transfer from the electron donor unit to the TiO2 electrode can be efficiently facilitated by the HOMO–LUMO transition. Excited-state TD-DFT calculations illustrate that the lowest transition of JK-274 at 472 nm (f = 0.65) is mainly characterized by a mixture of HOMO → LUMO (71%) and HOMO−1 → LUMO excitations (23%), JK-275 at 488 nm (f = 0.82) is HOMO → LUMO (70%) and HOMO−1 → LUMO excitations (23%), and JK-276 at 498 nm is HOMO → LUMO (71%) and HOMO−1 → LUMO excitations (24%), affording a facile charge flow from the amino unit (HOMO) to the anchoring unit (LUMO).

Photovoltaic performance
The photovoltaic performance of the DSSCs was obtained using a polymer gel electrolyte consisting of 0.6 M 1,2-dimethyl-n-propylimidazolium iodide (DMPImI), 0.05 M I2, 0.1 M LiI, 0.8 M t-butylpyridine and 5 wt% poly(vinylidenefluoride-co-hexafluoro)propylene (PVDF-HFP) in CH3CN. Fig. 4(b) shows the photocurrent density–voltage curves for the DSSCs based on JK-274, JK-275, and JK-276 and the polymer gel electrolyte under standard global AM 1.5 solar conditions. The JK-274, JK-275, and JK-276 sensitized cells gave short circuit photocurrent densities (Jsc) of 14.73, 15.52, and 16.61 mA cm−2, open circuit voltages (Voc) of 0.71, 0.65, and 0.69 V and fill factors of 0.73, 0.74, and 0.72, corresponding to the overall conversion efficiencies of 7.64, 7.46, and 8.31%, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, the efficiency of 8.31% in JK-276 is the highest ever reported for DSSCs based on organic sensitizers, which is comparable to the 9.03% efficiency obtained by combining a ruthenium sensitizer (N719) with a polymer gel electrolyte containing PAN-NA.9a The short circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) for DSSCs based on JK-275 and JK-276 is higher than that for the reference sensitizer JK-274 under the same conditions. A significant increase of Jsc in JK-275 and JK-276 is related to the red-shifted and broad absorption peak relative to that of JK-274. The incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) of JK-275 and JK-276 exceeds 75% in the spectral range from 426 to 590 nm, reaching their maximum of 83% at 520 nm. For comparison, we measured the photovoltaic performance by using a volatile electrolyte comprising of 0.6 M DMPImI, 0.05 M I2, 0.1 M LiI, and 0.8 M t-butylpyridine in CH3CN. The power conversion efficiencies of the JK-274, JK-275, and JK-276 based DSSCs afforded 7.69, 7.54, and 8.40% (for JK-274: Jsc = 13.42 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.75 V, ff = 0.76; for JK-275: Jsc = 14.92 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.66 V, ff = 0.76; for JK-276: Jsc = 15.50 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.73 V, ff = 0.75), respectively. The increased photocurrent in gel electrolyte relative to liquid electrolyte may be attributable to the polymer network in which the ions can move freely and the decreased voltage in gel electrolyte compared to liquid electrolyte may be related to the decreasing electron lifetime (see the laser-induced measurements). The gel-state cell of the three sensitizers can achieve an efficiency of 96–98% of the value of the corresponding liquid-state cells, indicating that gelation has no adverse effect on the conversion efficiency. Similar phenomena were observed in gel-state ruthenium cells.9a,12c

Since long-term stability is a vital parameter for sustained cell operation, we substituted the liquid electrolyte with a quasi-solid state cell. Fig. 5 shows the photovoltaic performance during the long-term accelerated aging of JK-274, JK-275, and JK-276 using a quasi-solid electrolyte and a liquid electrolyte. The initial efficiency of 8.24% in JK-276 remains almost unchanged during the 300 h light-soaking test at 70 °C. After 300 h of light soaking, the Voc of JK-276 decreased by 38 mV, but the loss was compensated by an increase in Jsc. However, the cell using the liquid electrolyte retained only 25% of its initial performance under the same conditions. Devices employing JK-274 and JK-275 using gel electrolyte showed good long-term stability when subjected to an accelerated light soaking test at 70 °C. The initial efficiency of 7.65% in both cells decreased to 7.32% in JK-275 and to 7.02% in JK-274. The long-term stability of JK-276 is remarkable because only a few ruthenium polypyridyl sensitizers passed the accelerating test for 300 h with an efficiency of 8% using a quasi-solid electrolyte.9 The enhanced long-term stability of JK-276 can be attributed to the rigid planar bridging unit.

Laser-induced transient photocurrent and photovoltage measurements

Fig. 6 shows the electron diffusion coefficients and lifetimes of the DSSCs employing different dyes (i.e.JK-274, JK-275, and JK-276) and electrolytes (i.e. liquid and gel electrolytes) displayed as a function of the Jsc and Voc, respectively. No significant differences among the De values were observed under the identical Jsc conditions by varying the kinds of dyes and electrolytes, showing a similar trend to those of coumarin dyes.20 Meanwhile, the difference in the τe values was clearly seen among the cells employing different dyes. The increasing order of the τe values was JK-275 < JK-276 < JK-274 under the identical Voc conditions in both cases of liquid and gel electrolytes and the results are also well consistent with those of the Voc shown in Table 2. However, the lifetimes of the cells employing gel electrolyte were shown to be somewhat shorter than those of the cells filled with liquid electrolyte. It is believed that the reduced mobility of I3− ions in gel electrolyte facilitated the electron recombination on the surface of dye-attached TiO2 nanoparticles.

Electrochemical impedance study

Fig. 7 shows the ac impedance spectra of the DSSCs measured in the dark for the devices employing the three dyes in the liquid- and gel-state electrolyte. In the dark under forward bias (−0.70 V), the semicircle in the intermediate frequency regime reflects mainly the recombination impedance caused by electron loss from the conduction band of TiO2 to I3− ions in the electrolyte. A larger radius of the semicircle for this intermediate frequency regime in the liquid electrolyte implies a lower rate of electron recombination at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface. In the dark at −0.70 V forward bias, the radius of this semicircle increases in the order JK-274 (147.3 Ω) > JK-276 (57.5 Ω) > JK-275 (18.8 Ω), in accord with the trends in the value of Voc. Under the same conditions, the radius of the semicircle in gel electrolyte increases in the order JK-274 (85.3 Ω) > JK-276 (19.9 Ω) > JK-275 (13.3 Ω). As the diameter of the middle frequency semicircle is bigger, the charge recombination at the dye-coated TiO2/electrolyte is smaller. Therefore, the Voc in liquid electrolyte is bigger than that in gel-electrolyte.

Conclusions
We have designed and synthesized three highly efficient organic sensitizers containing a planar 4,4-dimethyl-4H-indeno[1,2-b]thiophene or 4,4-dimethyl-4H-indeno[1,2-b]thienothiophene bridged unit. The photovoltaic performance is quite sensitive to the bridged unit. A solar-cell device based on the JK-276 in conjunction with a volatile liquid electrolyte and a gel-electrolyte yielded an overall conversion efficiency of 8.40% and 8.31%, respectively. The efficiency of 8.31% is the highest one reported for DSSCs based on organic sensitizers and gel electrolyte. Moreover, the JK-275 and JK-276 based cells showed excellent stability under light soaking at 70 °C for 300 h. The initial efficiency of 8.24% revealed a slight change to 8.20% after 300 h of light soaking. The short circuit photocurrent density in JK-276 is higher that those in JK-274 or JK-275 due to the incorporation of a more planar delocalized unit into the bridged group. We believe that highly efficient gel-state devices are possible through the molecular design of efficient organic sensitizers, and work on that is now in progress.
Experimental
All reactions were carried out under an argon atmosphere. Solvents were distilled from appropriate reagents. All reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and TCI. 7-Heptyl-9,9-dimethyl-9H-fluoren-2-amine (1), 2-heptyl-7-iodo-9,9-dimethyl-9H-fluorene (2), 6-bromo-4,4-dimethyl-4H-indeno[1,2-b]thiophene (3a) and 6-bromo-4,4-dimethyl-4H-indeno[1,2-b]thienothiophene (3b) were prepared according to the procedure mentioned in the literature.14,211H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian Mercury 300 spectrometer. Chemical shift δ was calibrated against TMS as an internal standard. Elemental analyses were performed with a Carlo Elba Instruments CHNS-O EA 1108 analyzer. The absorption and photoluminescence spectra were recorded on a Perkin-Elmer Lambda 2S UV-visible spectrometer and a Perkin LS fluorescence spectrometer, respectively.
Characterization of DSSC
The cells were measured using a 1000 W xenon light source, whose power of an AM 1.5 Oriel solar simulator was calibrated using a KG5 filtered Si reference solar cell. The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra for the cells were measured on an IPCE measuring system (PV Measurements).
Cyclic voltammograms
CVs of the three organic sensitizers were measured in dichloromethane solution with 0.1 M tetrabutyl ammonium hexafluorophosphate (n-Bu4NPF6) as the supporting salt. The platinum working electrode consisted of platinum wire sealed in a soft glass tube with a surface of 0.785 mm2, which was polished down to 0.5 μm with Buehler polishing paste prior to use in order to obtain reproducible surfaces. The counter electrode consisted of platinum wire and the reference electrode was an Ag/AgCl secondary electrode.
Dye-sensitized solar cell fabrication
FTO glass plates (Pilkington TEC Glass-TEC 8, Solar 2.3 mm thickness) were cleaned in a detergent solution using an ultrasonic bath for 30 min, and rinsed with water and ethanol. The FTO glass plates were immersed in 40 mM TiCl4 (aqueous) at 70 °C for 30 min and washed with water and ethanol. A transparent nanocrystalline layer on the FTO glass plate was prepared using doctor blade printing TiO2 paste (Solaronix, Ti-Nanoxide T/SP) and then dried for 2 h at 25 °C. The TiO2 electrodes were gradually heated under an air flow at 325 °C for 5 min, at 375 °C for 5 min, at 450 °C for 15 min, and at 500 °C for 15 min. The thickness of the transparent layer was measured using an Alpha-step 250 surface profilometer (Tencor Instruments, San Jose, CA), a paste for the scattering layer containing 400 nm sized anatase particles (CCIC, PST-400C) was deposited by doctor blade printing and then dried for 2 h at 25 °C. The TiO2 electrodes were gradually heated under an air flow at 325 °C for 5 min, at 375 °C for 5 min, at 450 °C for 15 min, and at 500 °C for 15 min. The resulting layer was composed of 20 μm thickness of the transparent layer and 4 μm thickness of the scattering layer. The TiO2 electrodes were treated again by TiCl4 at 70 °C for 30 min and sintered at 500 °C for 30 min. The TiO2 electrodes were immersed into JK-274, JK-275 and JK-276 (0.3 mM in THF/EtOH = 1/2) containing 30 mM 3a,7a-dihydroxy-5b-cholic acid (Cheno) and kept at room temperature for 18 h. The FTO plate (Pilkington TEC Glass-TEC 8, Solar 2.3 mm thickness) for counter electrodes was cleaned with an ultrasonic bath in H2O, acetone and 0.1 M HCl aq., subsequently. Counter electrodes were prepared by coating with a drop of H2PtCl6 solution (2 mg of Pt in 1 mL of ethanol) on a FTO plate and heating at 400 °C for 15 min. The dye adsorbed TiO2 electrode and Pt-counter electrode were assembled into a sealed sandwich-type cell by heating at 80 °C with a hot-melt ionomer film (Surlyn SX 1170-25, Solaronix) as a spacer between the electrodes. A drop of the electrolyte solution (liquid electrolyte: 0.6 M DMPImI, 0.05 M iodine, 0.1 M LiI, and 0.8 M t-butylpyridine in acetonitrile; gel electrolyte: 0.6 M DMPImI, 0.05 M I2, 0.1 M LiI, 0.8 M t-butylpyridine, and 5 wt% poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) in acetonitrile) was placed on the drilled hole in the counter electrode of the assembled cell and was driven into the cell via vacuum backfilling. Finally, the hole was sealed using additional Surlyn and a cover glass (0.1 mm thickness).
Electron transport measurements
The electron diffusion coefficient (De) and lifetimes (τe) of the TiO2 photoelectrode were measured by the stepped light-induced transient measurements of photocurrent and voltage (SLIM-PCV).22 The transients were induced by a stepwise change in the laser intensity. A diode laser (λ = 635 nm) as a light source was modulated using a function generator. The initial laser intensity was a constant 90 mW cm−2 and was attenuated up to approximately 10 mW cm−2 using a ND filter which was positioned at the front side of the fabricated samples (TiO2 film thickness = ca. 8 μm; active area = 0.04 cm2). The photocurrent and photovoltage transients were monitored using a digital oscilloscope through an amplifier. The De value was obtained by a time constant (τc) determined by fitting a decay of the photocurrent transient with exp(−t/τc) and the TiO2 film thickness (ω) using the equation, De = ω2/(2.77τc).22 The τe value was also determined by fitting a decay of the photovoltage transient with exp(−t/τe).22 All experiments were carried out at room temperature.
