    , Accepted 9th March 2020First published on 9th March 2020AbstractDue to its excellent electrical and optical properties, tin selenide (SnSe), a typical candidate of two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors, has attracted great attention in the field of novel optoelectronics. However, the large-area growth of high-quality SnSe films still remains a great challenge, which limits their practical applications. Here, wafer-size SnSe ultrathin films with high uniformity and crystallization were deposited via a scalable magnetron sputtering method. The results showed that the SnSe photodetector was highly sensitive to a broad range of wavelengths in the UV-visible-NIR range, especially showing an extremely high responsivity of 277.3 A W−1 with the corresponding external quantum efficiency of 8.5 × 104% and detectivity of 7.6 × 1011 Jones. These figures of merits are among the best performances for the sputter-fabricated 2D photodetector devices. The photodetecting mechanisms based on a photogating effect induced by the trapping effect of localized defects are discussed in detail. The results indicate that the few-layered SnSe films obtained from sputtering growth have great potential in the design of high-performance photodetector arrays.
Introduction
Two-dimensional (2D) layered materials including graphene,1,2 transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs),3–5 III–VI compounds,6,7 IV–VI compounds,8,9 topological crystalline insulators (TCIs),10,11 and black phosphorus (BP)12,13 have become promising candidates towards the next-generation electronic and optoelectronic devices due to their unique dimensional-dependent properties. Tin monoselenide (SnSe), one typical candidate of IV–VI 2D layered materials, has an orthorhombic lattice configuration with a distorted NaCl structure.14 SnSe has a high optical absorption coefficient of ∼105 cm−1, which is ∼1–2 orders of magnitude higher than that of Si and GaAs.15 Thus, SnSe has attracted much attention in the development of optical–electrical-conversion devices, such as optical sensors and solar cells.16,17 From the viewpoint of commercial applications, wafer-size 2D SnSe films are desirable for developing practical optoelectronic devices, which can be integrated with the conventional complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor (CMOS) fabrication process. Previously, 2D SnSe nanosheets have been synthesized successfully by several methods, including exfoliation routes,18,19 solution-phase synthesis methods,20–23 and vapor transport deposition methods.24–28 However, the synthesized SnSe nanosheets are only about several micrometers in dimension and more importantly, their thickness is uncontrollable, due to which it is difficult to achieve high-quality and uniform 2D SnSe films in high yields. Comparatively, the magnetron sputtering technique, a mature industrial technology due to its scalability, economical cost, high efficiency and precise thickness controllability, has emerged as a research focus for realizing the synthesis of different kinds of wafer-sized thin films, such as oxide semiconductors, dielectrics, and superconductors.29–31 However, few results have been reported about the large-area growth of 2D layered SnSe films for high-performance photodetectors.
In this work, ultra-thin layered SnSe films were grown through the magnetron sputtering technique. The SnSe films showed high crystallinity and uniform continuity in the wafer size. In particular, the SnSe photodetector exhibited excellent performance with a broadband photoresponse from visible to near-infrared light, showing an extremely high responsivity of 277.3 A W−1 with the corresponding external quantum efficiency of 8.5 × 104%, detectivity of 7.6 × 1011 Jones, and fast response/relaxation speeds of ∼0.35/1.83 s, respectively.
Results and discussion
In our experiments, the SnSe films were grown on 300 nm-thick SiO2/Si substrates by the DC magnetron sputtering technique. During the deposition process, high-energy argon ions were bombarded on the surface of the SnSe target, vaporizing a large amount of Sn and Se atoms and forming plasma plume, which condensed into a film on the preheated substrate (Fig. 1a).

In order to achieve a high-quality film, the target-to-substrate distance, deposition temperature, gas pressure and sputtering power have already been optimized. Additionally, an in situ annealing process was performed after the deposition to improve crystallization. Fig. 1b presents the image of the ultrathin SnSe film (thickness: ∼5.0 nm) on a 1 inch SiO2/Si wafer. As shown, the SnSe film has uniform color, indicating the uniformity of the SnSe film. From the AFM image (Fig. 1c), one can see that the film has a smooth surface with a root-mean-square roughness of ∼0.45 nm. No obvious out-of-plane growth is observed, further indicating the uniform morphology of the sputtered SnSe film. In order to measure the uniformity of the film, Raman spectroscopy (Fig. 1d) was used to analyze five different spots randomly distributed on the surface, as shown in the inset. Two obvious peaks located at 68.7 and 155.5 cm−1 can be assigned to the out-of-plane Ag1 and Ag3 vibrations, respectively, and the peak at 99.4 cm−1 corresponds to the in-plane B3g vibration. All the Raman spectra from the five different positions show a similar profile and intensity, indicating the homogeneous growth of the SnSe film on a large scale up to wafer size. The Raman mapping of the SnSe film carried out over 20 × 20 μm also clearly indicated high uniformity. X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) was used to examine the chemical composition of the film, as shown in Fig. 1e and f. The high-resolution Sn 3d spectrum can be deconvoluted into two peaks located at 485.6 and 494.0 eV, which correspond to Sn 3d5/2 and Sn 3d3/2. The Se 3d peak can be fitted by two peaks located at 53.1 and 54.0 eV, corresponding to Se 3d5/2 and Se 3d3/2.19 Importantly, the result calculated according to the integrated intensities of Sn 3d and Se 3d shows that the Sn:Se ratio is ∼0.98, which is close to the chemical composition of single-phase SnSe.
To understand its crystal structure, the SnSe film was transferred onto a TEM grid using a poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA)-assisted method and studied using high-resolution TEM, as shown in Fig. 2. Fig. 2a and b show the TEM images of the SnSe film at low and high magnifications, respectively. From the high-resolution TEM image, we can see that the domain size is about ∼20 nm. The inset in Fig. 2b clearly shows that the lattice fringe of SnSe is 0.28 nm, which corresponds to the (011) plane. The low pass filtered atomic pattern implies the high quality of the SnSe film. The fast Fourier transform (FFT) patterns in the inset clearly show the four-fold rotational symmetric diffraction pattern, suggesting the orthorhombic structure of SnSe. Fig. 2c shows the element mapping, where one can see that the Se and Sn elements are uniformly distributed on the film, and the atomic ratio of Sn and Se is about 1:0.98 (Fig. 2d), which is the same as the XPS result.

To investigate the optical properties, the SnSe film was grown on quartz using the same protocol. Fig. 3a shows the transmittance spectrum (UV) of the SnSe films with different thicknesses: ∼5.0 nm, 10.0 nm and 15.0 nm. The inset shows the image of the 5.0 nm-thick SnSe film grown on quartz. As shown, the SnSe films exhibit obvious absorption in a wide wavelength range of UV-Vis-NIR (300–1100 nm) even at an ultrathin thickness of ∼5.0 nm. The absorption increases on increasing the film thickness. Furthermore, (αhν)1/2 as a function of photon energy, hν, is plotted in Fig. 3b, wherein h is the Planck constant and ν is the photon frequency; α is the absorption coefficient and is calculated by αd = ln(1/T). Also, d and T are the thickness and transmittance of the films, respectively. The energy-band gap (Eg) of the film can be extracted by the intercept of the line on the hν axis. As seen, Eg increases from ∼1.16 eV to ∼1.45 eV when the film thickness decreases from 15.0 nm to 5.0 nm. The thickness dependence of energy-band gaps is usually observed in 2D nanosheets,6,32 which is mainly caused by the quantum confinement effect. The information on the carrier recombination in the 5.0 nm-thick SnSe film is acquired from the time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) decay curve, as shown in Fig. 3c. The intrinsic carrier lifetime of ∼960 ps, which is much longer than that in other mono-/multilayered nanosheets,33,34 suggests that parts of the carrier trapping centers should exist in the film.35 The photo-generated carriers will be trapped, inducing a decrease in the recombination rate, resulting in an increase in the carrier lifetime. Fig. 3d shows the PL decay curves for the SnSe films with different thicknesses, where one can see that the carrier lifetime has no obvious change on increasing the film thickness.

In order to characterize the photosensing performance, the lateral device structures of Ag/SnSe/Ag on SiO2/Si wafers were fabricated, as shown in Fig. 4a. The inset shows an enlarged optical image of a single device. The channel length and width were ∼10 μm and ∼200 μm, respectively. A schematic of the fabricated SnSe photodetector under illumination is shown in Fig. 4b. Fig. 4c presents the Id–Vd curves with and without laser irradiation, where an obvious photocurrent can be observed. The nonlinear Id–Vd curves indicate the formation of the Ag/SnSe Schottky contacts caused by the difference in work functions. Fig. 4d shows the photocurrents as a function of laser power. As seen, the photocurrents increase gradually on increasing the laser intensity. Fig. 4e shows the time-dependent photoresponse under a 404 nm laser with varying power densities. The SnSe photodetector exhibits two obvious “high” and “low” current states when the laser is switched between “on” and “off”. The current states exhibit high stability and reproducibility. Fig. 4f shows a single-cycle response curve of the photodetector, where the rising and falling times of ∼0.35 s and 1.83 s, respectively, can be achieved. The sluggish recovery is probably ascribed to the long-lived traps, which may be induced by point vacancy and crystalline boundary defects.36

(b) Schematic illustration of the SnSe photodetector under illumination. (c) Id–Vd curves of the photodetector with and without laser irradiation (λ = 404 nm, P = 15.5 mW cm−2).

(e) Time-dependent photoresponse of the SnSe photodetector at different laser power densities. (f) Single-cycle response curve of the photodetector for rising/falling time analysis. 

Fig. 5a presents the photocurrent curves of the SnSe photodetector under the laser irradiation of different wavelengths including 404 nm, 515 nm, 650 nm, 808 nm and 980 nm. The power density is fixed at ∼5.6 mW cm−2. The photocurrent increases from 0.07 μA to 1.52 μA when the wavelength of the incident light decreases from 980 to 404 nm. More importantly, the photocurrent profile is well consistent with the absorption spectrum, as shown in Fig. 5b. Thus, it can be inferred that the photocurrents arise from the SnSe film and the photosensing characteristics are mainly attributed to photon excitation. Fig. 5c shows the time-dependent photoresponse under laser irradiation of different wavelengths. The SnSe photodetector exhibits pronounced “high” and “low” current states under all laser wavelengths. Even at an infrared laser wavelength of 980 nm, the photodetector still exhibits obvious photosensing behavior and it can be modulated by varying the laser power densities, as shown in Fig. 5d. Based on the above-mentioned photosensing characteristics, one can propose that the SnSe films can be widely applied to develop broadband photodetector devices.

(c) Time-dependent photoresponse of the SnSe photodetector measured under laser irradiation of different wavelengths.

Fig. 6a shows the plot of photocurrents as a function of laser power densities under different wavelengths, including 404 nm, 515 nm, 650 nm, 808 nm and 980 nm. As shown, the photocurrents exhibit strong dependence on power densities. The curve can be fitted to the power law Iph = APθ, where A is a constant for a certain wavelength and θ is an exponent of the response of the photocurrent to laser power density. For an ideal photodetector without trap states, θ = 1.0.16,33 However, the θ values for the fabricated 2D SnSe photodetector vary from 0.54 to 0.66 and are thus smaller than 1.0, which indicates that parts of the local trap states exist in the as-grown 2D SnSe film. To further evaluate the performance of the SnSe film as a photodetector, three important figures of merit were calculated, namely, responsivity (R), external quantum efficiency (EQE) and detectivity (D*); R is defined as the photocurrent induced by the excitation of unit incident laser power. It can be obtained by the equation36R = Iph/PS, where Iph, P and S represent the photocurrents, incident power density and active device area, respectively. EQE describes the ratio of the number of outgoing free electrons to that of the impinging photons. EQE can be extracted from the equation36 EQE = hcR/eλ, where h is the Planck's constant, c is the speed of light, e is the electron charge and λ is the wavelength of the excitation light. Detectivity is a parameter used to evaluate the device capability to detect weak optical signals. It can be calculated according to the equation36D* = R/sqrt(2eId), where Id is the dark current. The power-dependent responsivity, external quantum efficiency and detectivity under different laser wavelengths are shown in Fig. 6d. We can see that these figures of merit show similar dependence on laser power densities. All of them decrease on increasing the power density. More importantly, the 2D SnSe photodetector exhibits the highest responsivity of 277.3 A W−1 with the corresponding EQE of 8.5 × 104% and detectivity of 7.6 × 1011 cm Hz1/2 W−1 (Jones). According to our measurements, the fabricated SnSe photodetector also exhibits high response homogeneity (Fig. S1†) and environmental stability (Fig. S2†). Fig. 7 summarizes the corresponding figures of merit of other reported photodetectors based on 2D IV–VI, TMDs, topological insulators (TIs), BP and Weyl semimetals.6,36–47 Comparatively, the present 2D SnSe photodetector exhibits competitive photosensing performance with ultrahigh responsivity, external quantum efficiency and detectivity as well as fast response/recovery speeds. According to the above-mentioned discussion, the exceptional photosensing performance might be attributed to the following aspects: (i) SnSe possess a moderate bandgap of 1.16–1.45 eV. This bandgap range is smaller than that for TMDs (∼1.8 eV), yielding much more photoexcited e–h pairs. (ii) On the other hand, the gap is larger than those of narrow-gap materials including topological insulators, Weyl semimetals and BP (0–0.3 eV), effectively suppressing the recombination of the e–h pairs. (iii) The high crystalline quality of the uniform SnSe film in wafer size obtained using the high-energy sputtering process can greatly enhance the electrical transport of photoexcited carriers compared to that observed for the SnSe-based films grown by other methods. These reasons might be responsible for the improved performance of the fabricated SnSe device.

Considering the large channel region, the bias voltage is 15.0 V. 
 Fig. 7  Comparison of the photosensing performance of the present 2D SnSe films with other reported 2D films grown by sputtering methods. 
The photosensing mechanisms of the SnSe photodetector were further investigated by energy-band diagrams. Fig. 8a and b present the traditional ideal band alignments for a 2D SnSe channel in contact with two metal (Ag) electrodes under external bias in the dark and under laser irradiation, respectively. Due to the presence of excess Se elements as acceptors in the film, the as-grown 2D SnSe film shows p-type behavior with a work function (W) of ∼5.2 eV. Here, the work function of the Ag electrodes is considered to be 4.3 eV.48 As shown in Fig. 8a, Schottky contacts of Ag/SnSe can be formed due to their different work functions, leading to nonlinear current curves (Fig. 4c). According to the photosensing characteristics, photoconductive effects are induced in the 2D SnSe film. When photons with energies larger than the band gap (∼1.45 eV) are absorbed by the SnSe film, electron–hole pairs can be generated and then be separated by the applied external bias, resulting in the photocurrents and photosensing characteristics, as shown in Fig. 8b. However, the responsivity of the photodetectors based on 2D materials would have a limit of 1.0 A W−1 even if the incident photons with an energy of ∼1.0 eV are fully absorbed.49 Thus, another mechanism must exist in the 2D SnSe film and be responsible for the ultrahigh responsivity values (Fig. 6b). As we know, the magnetron sputtering technique is a deposition process with high-energy excitation, where unavoidable Sn and Se vacancies will be generated.50

(c and d) Band alignment with local defect levels in the dark and under laser irradiation, respectively. The solid horizontal segments represent the trap states near the bottom edge of the conduction band. 
The Sn vacancies will induce the Fermi energy to be closer to the valence band and then donate extra hole-type carriers to SnSe, resulting in p-type characteristics. In contrast, Se vacancies do not contribute to electrical transport because they form localized defect levels near the conduction band edge, yet they can trap the photoexcited electrons from the valence band.51Fig. 8c shows the energy band alignment with local defect levels in the dark. The solid horizontal segments represent trap states near the bottom edge of the conduction band. Upon laser irradiation, the absorption of the incident photons generates electron–hole pairs. Besides the movement of the photoexcited electrons into the conduction band, additional photogenerated electrons are trapped in the localized Se defect states, as shown in the energy band alignments in Fig. 8d. It can be understood that the lifetime of hole-type carriers can be prolonged when the electrons are trapped in the localized states due to the long relaxation time of the recombination of the related free electron–hole pairs, as shown in Fig. 3c and d. Thus, the trapped electrons act as a local gate and induce more holes in the channel,52 leading to ultrahigh responsivity with the corresponding high external quantum efficiency and high detectivity.
Experimental
Material synthesis
SnSe films were grown on SiO2 (300 nm)/Si substrates by the magnetron sputtering technique. Before deposition, the substrates were ultrasonically cleaned in alcohol, acetone, and de-ionized water sequentially. After drying with N2, the substrate was fixed on the sample heating holder and transferred into a vacuum deposition chamber, which was pumped to a background vacuum of 5 × 10−4 Pa. Then, the substrates were heated up to the deposition temperature of 450 °C. During deposition, the working pressure of argon gas and sputtering power were fixed at 1.0 Pa and 10.0 W, respectively. After the deposition, in situ post-annealing for 30 min at the deposition temperature was performed to enhance the crystallization of the SnSe film. Finally, the SnSe films were naturally cooled to room temperature under the vacuum of ∼5 × 10−4 Pa.
Material characterization
SnSe films were characterized using Raman spectroscopy (HORIBA, HR800) excited with a 532 nm laser. The X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were obtained by a Kratos Axis ULTRA spectrometer using a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray source (1486.6 eV). High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) was performed on JEM ARM300F. The ultraviolet-visible (UV) spectra were measured by a Hitachi U-3900 spectrophotometer. Time-resolved PL (TRPL) measurements were obtained using an FLS980 photoluminescence spectrometer. Excitation of the sample was achieved with a 380 nm laser from a Xe lamp, and the time resolution of this setup was about 50 ps. The surface morphology of the samples was scanned with a commercial atomic force microscope (AFM, SPM-300HV, SEIKO).
Device fabrication and measurements
To fabricate a metal–semiconductor–metal (MSM) photodetector based on the SnSe film, patterned metallic drain/source contacts (50 nm-thick Ag layer) were fabricated by typical photolithography followed by thermal evaporation and lift-off. To measure the photoresponse characteristics of the MSM device, laser sources with different wavelengths of 404, 515, 650, 780, 808, and 980 nm were used as the excitation light sources. Electrical measurements were performed on a semiconductor characterization system (Keithley 2400) combined with a probe station. All the electrical measurements were obtained at room temperature.
Conclusions
In summary, wafer-size uniform 2D SnSe ultrathin films with high quality were grown by the magnetron sputtering technique. The fabricated SnSe photodetectors demonstrated a UV-visible-NIR photoresponse, showing an ultrahigh responsivity of 277.3 A W−1 with the corresponding external quantum efficiency of 8.5 × 104% and detectivity of 7.6 × 1011 Jones as well as fast response/recovery speeds. These appreciable performances make the 2D SnSe films promising materials for developing high-performance optoelectronic devices.
