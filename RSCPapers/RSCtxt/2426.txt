    , Accepted 4th May 2011First published on 6th July 2011AbstractA series of conjugated polymers containing thienylenevinylene moieties as the electron donor for polymer solar cells were synthesized through Yamamoto and Stille coupling. The structure and device properties of the homopolymer (E)-poly[2,2′-(1,2-ethenediyl)bisthiophene] (PEBT), and two donor–acceptor-type copolymers (E)-poly[2,2′-(1,2-ethenediyl)bisthiophene-alt-4,7-(2,1,3-benzothiadiazole)] (PEBTBT) and (E)-poly[2,2′-(1,2-ethenediyl)bisthiophene-alt-5,5-(4′,7′-di-2-thienyl-2′,1′,3′-benzothiadiazole)] (PEBTTBT) were investigated. The vinylene group inserted between two thiophene rings has an important role in lowering the band gap of thienylenevinylene derivatives. In addition, the donor–acceptor-type copolymers including a benzothiadiazole unit showed even lower band gap than their own homopolymer due to intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) through their conjugated backbones. As a result, PEBT, PEBTBT and PEBTTBT showed band gaps of 1.77, 1.37 and 1.57 eV, respectively. Bulk heterojunction photovoltaic devices were fabricated using blends of the polymers with [6,6]-phenyl C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC70BM) and PEBTBT gave the best power conversion efficiency among them, at 1.07% under AM 1.5, 100 mW cm−2.
Introduction
In recent years, polymer solar cells have attracted much attention as a promising renewable resource because of the high absorption coefficient of conjugated polymers,1 their ability to form thin and flexible films through a solution process, and their potential use in low-cost photovoltaic technologies like printing or spray processes that would make roll-to-roll manufacturing possible.2 Since Heeger et al. reported on organic heterojunction solar cells in 1995,3 the bulk heterojunction has been a suitable concept for photovoltaic applications in order to increase internal carrier collection efficiency and energy conversion efficiency by photo-induced charge transfer between electron donor and electron acceptor.3 The nanoscale phase separation and the large interfacial area between a conjugated polymer and a fullerene derivative account for an increase in the power conversion efficiency of bulk heterojunction solar cells.4 Between these two composites, conjugated polymers have the main role of absorbing photons and creating excitons that diffuse to the interface between the polymer and the fullerene derivative. Also the fullerene derivatives usually act as electron acceptor for photovoltaic applications.3,5
Among many other conjugated polymers in bulk heterojunction solar cells, poly(thienylenevinylene) (PTV) is a promising candidate especially for low band gap polymers. This derivative of thienylenevinylene has a vinylene group between two adjacent thiophene rings which prevents steric hindrance of the two thiophenes.6 As a result, the polymer backbone becomes more planar and its π-conjugation system can be extended further, so it can lower the band gap of PTV.6
Many research groups have focused their attention on the poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT)/[6,6]-phenyl C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) system,4a but this system has the limitation of mismatching with maximum photon flux of the solar spectrum (1.4–1.6 eV), due to the somewhat larger band gap of P3HT (1.9 eV).7 It seems clear that electron-donor polymers which have a major role in creating excitons should absorb longer wavelength of sunlight in order to generate a larger amount of excitons. Therefore, many low-band-gap polymers which show band gaps of less than 1.8 eV by adopting donor–accepter copolymer architecture in their conjugated backbone have emerged to overcome the limited absorption of P3HT.4b,8
In the present study, we introduce three different PTV derivatives as conjugated electron-donor polymers in bulk heterojunction solar cells. In previous works, several PTV derivatives have already been used in thin film transistors6a,9 and in bulk heterojunction solar cells6a,10 due to their high charge carrier mobility9 and low band gap properties. Typically, we have applied the concept of donor–acceptor alternating copolymers using electron-rich thienylenevinylene and electron-poor benzothiadiazole units even in the lowering of the band gap. This concept can stabilize the quinoid form of a polymer since the alternation of donors and acceptors increases the double bond character between repeating units, thereby reducing bond length alternating energy and reducing the band gap.7
In this paper, a homopolymer and two copolymers of thienylenevinylene derivatives, (E)-poly[2,2′-(1,2-ethenediyl) bisthiophene] (PEBT), (E)-poly[2,2′-(1,2-ethenediyl) bisthiophene-alt-4,7-(2,1,3-benzothiadiazole)] (PEBTBT) and (E)-poly[2,2′-(1,2-ethenediyl)bisthiophene-alt-5,5-(4′,7′-di-2-thienyl-2′,1′,3′-benzothiadiazole)] (PEBTTBT) (Chart 1) were synthesized through Yamamoto11 and Stille12 coupling. Comparing the broad absorption spectra of these three PTV derivatives which cover the wide area of the visible range, we could ascertain the low band gap properties of the polymers and the effect of donor–acceptor alternating-type copolymers on the lowering of the band gap. Also we could check the influence of the strength of electron donating and accepting moieties on the band gap of the polymers and the current density of each solar cell. Our research shows that the proper donor–acceptor strength should be established in order to get low band gap polymer in polymer solar cells.

Experimental
Materials
All reagents were purchased from Aldrich or Merck and used without further purification. Anhydrous THF and diethyl ether were obtained by distillation with the standard Na-benzophenone system. 3-Dodecylthiophene (1),132-bromo-3-dodecylthiophene (2),134,7-dibromo-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (7),144,7-di-2-thienyl-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (8),15 and 4,7-bis(5-bromo-2-thienyl)-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (9)15 were synthesized according to procedures reported in the literature.
Characterization

1H NMR spectra were recorded with a JEOL JNM-LA300WB 300, 400 MHZ and chemical shifts were recorded in ppm units with TMS as the internal standard. The optical properties of the polymers were investigated viaUV/Vis. absorption spectral measurements at room temperature with a Perkin-Elmer Lambda 12 UV/Visible Spectrophotometer (HP 8453). Electrochemical measurements of the polymers were performed in an acetonitrile solution with 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium perchlorate (Bu4NClO4) as supporting electrolyte, indium tin oxide (ITO) as the working electrode, a Pt wire as the counter electrode, and a Ag wire as the reference electrode using a potentiostat (Eco Chemie, AUTOLAB) at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. Gel permeation chromatographic (GPC) analysis was carried out with a YOUNGLIN Acme 9000 instrument with chloroform as the eluent (flow rate: 1 mL min−1, at 35 °C) and polystyrene as the standard. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC, TA2010) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA, TA-2050) were performed under nitrogen flushing at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 to 800 °C. X-Ray diffraction measurements were carried out with a Rigaku RINT using a Cu Kα beam with a wavelength of λ = 0.154 nm. Mass spectra were obtained using gas-chromatography mass spectrometry (GCMS, Shimadzu GCMS-QP2010).
Device fabrication
All of the solar cells were fabricated with a configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC70BM/Ca/Al. Before device fabrication, indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass (Samsung Corning Co, Ltd., 10 Ω per square) substrates were cleaned and each substrate was treated with UV/ozone. PEDOT:PSS was used for the hole transporting layer and was spin-coated and subsequently annealed at 150 °C for 10 min, producing a film thickness of ∼30 nm. The substrates were then transferred into a nitrogen-filled glove box. Seven (7) mg of each polymer and 14 mg of PC70BM were dissolved in l mL of anhydrous chlorobenzene to a 1:2 weight ratio and stirred at 80 °C overnight in a N2-filled glove box. After spin-coating the blended solution at various spin speeds from 700 to 2700 rpm, 20 nm of Ca and 100 nm of Al were evaporated as a cathode on the active films through a shadow mask at 10−6 torr. The measured active area of all devices was 0.0475 cm2. The J–V curve of all devices was evaluated with a Keithley 4200 source measurement unit. Each device was illuminated at 100 mW cm−2 using a 1 kW Oriel solar simulator with an AM 1.5 G filter under a nitrogen atmosphere. A calibrated silicon reference solar cell certified by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) was used to confirm the measurement conditions. OTFT devices were fabricated in the BC/TG architecture. The source and drain electrodes were patterned using standard photolithographic methods and were deposited on cleaned glass by thermal evaporation (Ni/Au = 3/12 nm). The channel length and width were 20 μm and 10 μm, respectively. Before polymer deposition, the devices were treated with UV/ozone to clean the patterned substrate, and then polymer films were spin-coated from a 10 mg ml−1 solution in chlorobenzene and annealed at 80 °C for 20 min for evaporating solvent. After annealing, poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) films as gate dielectric layers with a thickness of 500 nm were spin-coated from an 80 mg mL−1 solution in n-butyl acetate and baked at 90 °C for 1 h in a glove box. Subsequently, aluminium electrodes of 30 nm thickness were deposited by thermal evaporation. OTFT devices were characterized using a Keithley 4200-SCS characterization system under ambient conditions.

Results and discussion
Material synthesis and characterization
The general synthetic routes toward the monomers are outlined in Scheme 1. In the structure of the thienylenevinylene monomers, two dodecyl alkyl chains were incorporated to increase the solubility and interdigitated state of the polymer.13 The alkylation reaction of 3-bromothiophene (1) was performed by Grignard reaction for high yield, and the product was then treated with 1.1 eq. of NBS to give monobrominated alkyl thiophene (2). Bromine attached at the 2- position of thiophene was replaced with aldehyde (3) through another Grignard reaction, and the product was coupled together to yield thienylenevinylene monomer (4). A subsequent bromination yielded di-brominated monomer (5) that underwent homo-polymerization via Yamamoto coupling11 using equivalent amounts of bis(1,5-cyclo-octadiene)nickel(0) (Ni(COD)2) and 2,2′-bipyridyl with monomer as a catalyst in toluene/DMF (4:1 v/v) co-solvent. The molecular weight of the homopolymer (PEBT), determined by GPC in chloroform, was Mn = 4400 g mol−1 with PDI = 1.16. Two copolymers, PEBTBT and PEBTTBT, were polymerized viaStille coupling of distannyl thienylenevinylene monomer (6) and di-brominated monomers, (7) and (9), respectively (Scheme 2).12 Typically, (6) was obtained at low temperature (−60, −40 °C) and the remaining product was purified several times using isopropyl alcohol before polymerization. Both 4,7-dibromo-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (7) and 4,7-bis(5-bromo-2-thienyl)-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (9) were prepared according to previously reported methods.14,15PEBTBT containing (7) was polymerized with catalytic amounts of Pd2(dba)3 and tri(o-toyl)phosphine in chlorobenzene with Mn = 4700 g mol−1 and PDI = 1.36. PEBTTBT containing (9), however, was polymerized with Pd(PPh3)4 as a catalyst, Mn = 3900 g mol−1 with PDI = 1.47. The polymerization results of three PTV derivatives including molecular weight, PDI and thermal properties are summarized in Table 1. The low molecular weights of the polymers are considered to be due to the limited solubility of thienylenevinylene derivatives in the reaction solvents.16

Thermal properties
Each polymer exhibited different thermal behavior, as revealed by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), as shown in Fig. 1. Considering the 5% weight loss temperature (Td) shown in Fig. 1a, there was a tendency that thermal stability increased as the molecular weight of the polymer increased (231–351 °C). PEBT and PEBTBT had clear Tc (crystalline temperature) and Tm (melting temperature) peaks at 95 °C and 127 °C, and at 116 and 131 °C, respectively, as shown in Fig. 1b. Therefore, both polymers are expected to have an ordered packing structure. Including PEBTTBT, which had no crystalline or melting peak, all polymers had a Tg (glass transition temperature) peak at around 80–90 °C.

Optical properties

UV-Vis absorption of PEBT, PEBTBT and PEBTTBT was measured both as thin film and in chlorobenzene solution. The absorption maximum (λmax) of PEBT appears at 513 nm in solution and 508 nm in film in Fig. 2a and in the film state, the absorption maximum value is a little more blue-shifted than in the solution. However, the onset of absorption spectra was red-shifted by about 60 nm. Except for the homopolymer (PEBT), the two copolymers (PEBTBT, PEBTTBT) exhibited two characteristic bands in the film absorption spectra near 435 and 461 nm which correspond to the π–π* transition of the main chain and at 680 and 634 nm which correspond to the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) interaction between the thienylenevinylene moiety and the benzothiadiazole segments, respectively.17PEBTBT showed a lower optical band gap (1.37 eV) than PEBT (1.77 eV) and PEBTTBT (1.57 eV) that can be explained by the much stronger ICT between the donating moiety (thienylenevinylene) and the accepting moiety (benzothiadiazole) so that a higher degree of electronic delocalization through the polymer chain can be obtained in PEBTBT than in the other two polymers.17 The reason for this stronger ICT is thought to be that a better electron donating–accepting strength can be achieved in PEBTBT than in the others.17 As a result, PEBTBT shows more broadening of the absorption spectrum in the film state than the solution state, and a lower optical band gap (1.37 eV) compared with PEBTTBT (1.57 eV), as shown in Fig. 2. It suggests that this D–A alternating copolymer has a strong chain–chain interaction between polymer chains induced by a strong ICT effect.18

PEBTBT and PEBTTBT had absorption maxima at 680 and 634 nm in film and 625 and 584 nm in the solution state, respectively. Both copolymers also showed a red-shift of ∼50 nm in the absorption maximum value in film compared with solution, due to an enhanced π–π stacking structure at the solid state film.17c
Electrochemical properties

Cyclic voltammetry measurement was carried out in order to determine the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level of each polymer. To estimate the energy levels of the polymer from the vacuum energy level, we used the ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) redox couple as a calibration reference. The redox potential of Fc/Fc+ which has an absolute energy level of −4.8 eV relative to the vacuum level for calibration17c is located at 0.40 V in 0.1 M Bu4NPF6/acetonitrile solution. The resulting oxidation and reduction cyclic voltammograms of the polymer thin films are shown in Fig. 3a and all the electrochemical redox data are summarized in Table 2. From these electrochemical data, we can estimate that the electrochemical band gaps are quite well-matched with their optical band gaps. The energy level diagram of all PTV derivatives is summarized in Fig. 3b. The HOMO levels of the copolymers PEBTBT and PEBTTBT are −4.89 and −4.95 eV, respectively, and these values are similar to the HOMO level of P3HT (−4.9 eV). In the case of PEBT, there is no distinct ICT effect along the polymer chains since it does not have a D–A alternating structure. This allows not only a larger optical band gap, but also a lower HOMO level (−5.3 eV) than the other two copolymers.

X-Ray diffractometry

Considering melting points at the DSC curves of PEBT and PEBTBT (Fig. 1), the lowered band gap of copolymers and the weak vibronic shoulder of PEBTBT at the UV-Vis. absorption spectrum (see Fig. 2), some crystalline features can be expected in PTV derivatives and they were confirmed by out of plane X-ray diffraction (Fig. 4). All polymers have [100] peaks around 2θ ∼4° when they are annealed which are typical for dodecyl alkyl chains separating the main chains by about 2.1 nm, according to Bragg's law.19 When PEBT and PEBTTBT are annealed, there is only one peak, at 3.88° and 4.02°, respectively, and the peak disappears when the polymers are blended with PC70BM molecules. This collapse of the crystalline peak indicates that the ordering of both polymers is disrupted by blending with PC70BM. However, PEBTBT has clear crystalline peaks at 4.38° and 8.72° that correspond to [100] and [200] respectively, which exist even after blending with acceptor molecules. Therefore, PEBTBT can be regarded as possessing a higher order of crystallinity than the two other polymers. This supposition matches well with the clear Tm, Tc peaks of PEBTBT in Fig. 1b and the greater broadening of film absorption due to stronger polymer chain–chain interaction18 compared with PEBTTBT in Fig. 2b.

Characterization of polymer solar cells
For the fabrication of polymer photovoltaic cells, all of the devices were fabricated with the configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC70BM/Ca/Al, where the active layer was composed of the polymer as electron-donor and PC70BM as electron-acceptor molecules.4 The active layer was spin-coated with various film thicknesses at several polymer-to-PC70BM ratios, and the experimental conditions of each blend of film and cell performance are demonstrated in Table 3. All devices were tested without thermal annealing because there was no thermal annealing effect on the device performance.

Fig. 5 displays the J–V characteristics of three cells prepared from various polymer blends with PC70BM. Two copolymers, PEBTBT and PEBTTBT showed relatively higher efficiency (∼1.0%) than PEBT due to the increased current density. There are several reasons for higher current density of copolymers. First, both copolymers have higher hole mobility (2.0 × 10−3, 9.3 × 10−4 cm2 V−1s−1) than homopolymer (2.1 × 10−4 cm2 V−1s−1) so that the generated charge carriers can reach each electrode faster and more efficiently. Second, broadening of absorption area and increased absorption efficiency (absorption coefficient, Fig. 7) also could be a factor of improving current density. Third, these two copolymers showed better blending morphology than PEBT as shown in Fig. 6. PEBT:PC70BM blend film showed a highly aggregated morphology and larger surface roughness (12.4 nm, in Table 3), which could be the reason for low current density. In general, nanoscale phase separation should be established for efficient exciton diffusion and charge separation due to the short exciton diffusion length (∼10 nm) of conjugated polymers.20 Therefore, large exciton recombination would occur in PEBT:PC70BM system because of large aggregation probably due to the low solubility of PEBT in chlorobenzene solvent and poor miscibility between conjugated polymer and PCBM molecules.17c Between the two copolymers, PEBTBT shows even lower band gap (1.37 eV in optical band gap) and higher hole mobility (2.0 × 10−3 cm2 V−1s−1) than PEBTTBT (1.57 eV and 9.3 × 10−4 cm2 V−1s−1, repectively). However, bulk morphology shows that the PEBTTBT:PC70BM system has less aggregated morphology than the PEBTBT:PC70BM system and therefore, PEBTTBT can show similar current density with PEBTBT in the solar cell device even though PEBTBT has higher hole mobility and absorption coefficient by itself. Interestingly, low open circuit voltage (Voc) was observed in the PEBTBT:PC70BM system which is quite poor considering its HOMO level (−4.89 eV, in Fig. 3a). There are some reports mentioning that highly crystalline characteristics of conjugated polymer would yield low charge transfer energy (Ect) between the polymer and acceptor molecule therefore, it lowers Voc of the solar cell.21 We suspect that the highly crystalline PEBTBT would make this Voc drop in its bulk system compared with other polymers.

The UV-Vis. absorption spectra of each of the blend films are shown, together with each IPCE in Fig. 7. Interestingly, it is clear that the absorption of copolymers at longer wavelength region which represents ICT is reduced when blended with acceptor molecules. The reason for this collapse is unclear, however, we speculate that the current densities of copolymers would be improved if we overcome this absorption collapse. Further research on this effect is currently underway.

Conclusion
In conclusion, we synthesized and characterized low-band-gap poly(thienylenevinylene) derivatives for bulk heterojunction photovoltaic applications. The vinylene group inserted between two thiophene rings contributed to lowering the band gap of the polymers, therefore, PEBT showed an optical band gap of 1.77 eV, PEBTBT for 1.37 eV and PEBTTBT for 1.57 eV. In addition, donor–acceptor type alternations in PEBTBT and PEBTTBT even lowered the band gap of these copolymers by ICT through conjugated backbones. PEBTBT has stronger ICT at long wavelength region than PEBTTBT due to the higher donor–acceptor strength than the other. Especially in the case of PEBTBT, higher molecular ordering was observed in the XRD analysis because of strong interaction between the polymer backbones. The copolymers PEBTBT (1.07%) and PEBTTBT (1.04%) showed better photovoltaic performance than the homopolymer PEBT (0.53%) due to their higher current density caused by larger absorption area, higher hole mobility and better bulk hetero- junction morphology. Although these PTV derivatives were not fully optimized, they showed low band gap properties and a clear increase in performance when the donor–acceptor concept was adopted.
