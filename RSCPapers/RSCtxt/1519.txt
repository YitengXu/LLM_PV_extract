    , Accepted 13th January 2012First published on 16th January 2012AbstractIn this study double linked porphyrin–fullerene and phthalocyanine–fullerene dyads and a single linked phthalocyanine–fullerene dyad were studied as components in inverted organic solar cells (OSCs) equipped with the well known P3HT:PCBM bulk heterojunction as the photoactive layer. The dyad monolayers were deposited onto a surface of P3HT:PCBM by using the Langmuir–Schäfer method, therefore forming oriented monolayers in which the electron donor (D) and the acceptor (A) exist as a close proximity pair in a 1∶1 molar ratio. As a result of this structure short circuit current density (Jsc), open circuit voltage (Voc), and power conversion efficiency (η) increased, while the fill factor (FF) remained the same. The devices which contained dyads with double linkage produced higher efficiencies than the one with a single linked dyad. This result can be explained in terms of molecular orientation. It was also verified that the prepared OSC devices have promising long term air stability.
1 Introduction
Supramolecular complexes of porphyrins and fullerenes have been actively studied in the search for optimal materials for organic photovoltaics.1–3Porphyrin is a substituted porphine, a parent compound of chlorophylls. Due to its three-dimensional extensively π-conjugated electron structure the covalently attached porphyrin–fullerene (PF) dyad is almost an ideal compound for electron transfer. Studies considering electron transfer kinetics of a double linked PF dyad (DHPF, Fig. 1) in solutions of varying polarity and in Langmuir–Blodgett (LB) monolayers verified the efficient electron transfer.4,5 The charge separated state, in a solid phase, has long lifetime and a formation quantum yield close to unity, based on the analysis of transient photocurrent and transient absorption in model devices, in which a LB monolayer of DHPF (10 mol% in the octadecylamine matrix) was combined with the monolayer(s) of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT).6–8 Photocurrent and -voltage generation in such layers provided the evidence for the mutual orientation of the DHPF molecules in the films.
 Fig. 1  Scheme of an inverted solar cell device with the dyads DHPF, DHPcF and MHPcF, and the chemical structures of solar cell materials; P3HT, PCBM, and Alq3, and the reference compounds, TBP, DHP and DHPc. 

        DHPF was used as a component in an inverted organic solar cell equipped with a bulk heterojunction of P3HT:PCBM as a photoactive part. In order to gain more insights into the molecular orientation, solar cells equipped with LS-deposited phthalocyanine–fullerene dyads (DHPcF and MHPcF, Fig. 1) with varying 3D geometry were also prepared and studied. An interesting difference in the present dyads is that DHPF tends to have a closely packed face-to-face configuration,4 while DHPcF and MHPcF have more extended structures.6 Instead of the more familiar LB technique an alternative touch-and-lift method, Langmuir–Schäfer (LS), was used in this work for three reasons: to avoid an additional exposure of devices to aqueous phase, as required in the LB deposition, to ensure a good adhesion by attaching hydrophobic surfaces face-to-face, and to obtain a homogenous layer, which consists 100% of the dyad molecules without insulating matrix molecules.
Organic solar cells (OSCs) are based on relatively simple designs. The electron donor (D) and acceptor (A) exist either as stacked layers or as a bulk mixture between metallic and semiconducting electrodes. In a layered OSC, open circuit voltage (Voc) is often determined by the energy offset between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of D and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of A (i.e. effective bandgap).9 In a bulk heterojunction (BHJ) device, the build-in electric field arising from the difference between the anode and cathode work functions contributes to Voc as well.10 In a typical BHJ device, the active layer is spin coated from a concentrated solution, in which D and A are already blended. Distribution of D and A throughout the film is very sensitive to environmental factors, i.e.spinning speed, acceleration, solvent evaporation, thermal post-treatment, and encapsulation. At the present, such devices frequently reveal power conversion efficiencies (η) over 5%.11 Alternatively, D and A can be covalently linked to form a D–A dyad by using different chromophores and chemical linkers between them. The dyad is a photo-voltage generating molecular dipole and the molecules can be assembled mutually using surface chemistry methods, which require precise tailoring of the hydrophilic and hydrophobic groups to the D and A moieties. The advantages of OSCs compared to other solar cell types are lower production costs and high flexibility in applications.12 According to a recent report the long-term stability of P3HT:PCBM based OSC modules under real outdoor conditions has been improved significantly.13
An inverted device architecture with a ZnO electron collecting layer on an ITO cathode has promising air stability.15,17 PCBM has a tendency to phase separate towards hydrophilic substrates (e.g. ITO|ZnO), which encourages the choice of inverted design as well.14 The aim of this study was to enhance the electric field between the electrodes by using the oriented dyad layer on the topmost surface of P3HT:PCBM, which is in close proximity to the Au anode. A thin layer of aluminium tris(8-hydroxyquinoline) (Alq3) was used as an anodic buffer based on previous experience.16,17 Long-term stability of the devices was verified by repeating the measurements after the cells were stored in a dark ambient atmosphere for one year.
2 Experimental
2.1 Materials

          DHPF, DHPcF, and MHPcF were synthesized as described in the literature.18–20 Reference compounds DHP and DHPc were taken from the same synthetic batch and thus their structures are the same as those of the corresponding dyads in the absence of C60. ZnO layers were prepared by using a solution (50 g l−1) of zinc acetate dihydrate (Sigma-Aldrich) in a mixture of 96% 2-methoxy ethanol (Sigma-Aldrich, 98%) and 4% ethanolamine (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.3%) as a precursor.15P3HT was purchased from Rieke metals (regioregular, 4002-E), [60]PCBM from NanoC, and Alq3 from Sigma-Aldrich (99.995%). ITO coated glass substrates (1.2 × 3.5 cm2, 8 Ω/□) were purchased from Solems.
2.2 Film preparation
ITO coated glass substrates were patterned by using an acid etching method, which is described elsewhere.16 After the etching, the plates were cleaned in an ultrasonic bath in acetone, CHCl3, sodium dodecylsulfate, and isopropanol for 30 min in each. Finally the substrates were cleaned in N2 plasma for 10 min before the film depositions. The method to prepare the ZnO film onto an ITO substrate was adopted from the literature.15P3HT and PCBM were first dissolved separately in ortho-dichlorobenzene (Sigma-Aldrich, 99%). Solutions were combined, stirred at 60 °C overnight, and finally sonicated at 50 °C for 30 min prior to casting. The P3HT:PCBM layers were spin coated (Laurell technologies, 600 rpm, 5 min) onto the ZnO surface, followed by annealing in a vacuum at 110 °C for 10 min.
The LS films were deposited by using a KSV minitrough (KSV Instruments Ltd.) loaded with aqueous (MilliQ, Millipore) phosphate buffer (0.6 mM, pH = 7.0, ρ > 18.0 MΩ cm) as a sub-phase. The temperature of the sub-phase was assumed to be constant (19 ± 0.5 °C). Dyads were spread onto the surface from CHCl3 solution (0.3 mM), and monolayers were compressed at a rate of 550 mm2 min−1 using two barriers. The film depositions were done at a surface pressure of 12 mN m−1. The pressure was monitored with a Wilhelmy plate. The Alq3, TBP and C60 buffer layers were evaporated (Edwards AUTO-306) in a high vacuum (ca. 10−6 mbar) at temperatures of 190–200 °C, 290 °C, and 400 °C. To finalize the samples, Au electrodes were thermally evaporated through a shadow mask which produces an active area of 1 mm2.
2.3 Characterization
Absorption and emission spectra were measured with standard spectrophotometers (Shimadzu UV-3600 UV-vis, Fluorolog Jobin Yvon-SPEX). Fluorescence lifetimes (τ) (Table 1) were determined with a time correlated single photon counting system which was equipped with a Picoharp 300 controller and a PDL 800-B driver for excitation and a microchannel plate photomultiplier (Hamamatsu R3809U-50) for detection in 90° configuration. The excitation wavelength was 405 nm with a pulse frequency of 2.5 MHz.

The individual thicknesses of the layers were determined with an optical profilometer (Veeco NT1100) in phase shifting mode. A multilayered stack consisting of seven identical monolayers of DHPF, deposited one-by-one from the same Langmuir-surface, was prepared onto a quartz plate (Q) by using the described LS-method. Each layer is identically oriented (C60 towards the substrate) to produce a multilayered stack of Q|ODA|7 × (C60–P|). A monolayer of optically inert octadecylamine (ODA) with known thickness (2.5 nm) was deposited onto the substrate in order to make it hydrophobic (as the C60 side of the dyad). The absorption spectrum was measured after the deposition of each layer, and the thickness of the complete stack was finally determined by using a profilometer.
Current–voltage (I–V) measurements were performed by using a standard source/monitor unit (E5272A, Agilent Technologies) and illuminating the devices with an AM1.5 solar simulator (Luzchem LZC-SSR). Photocurrent quantum efficiency spectra were measured by using a Xenon lamp (71208, Newport 75 W) coupled with monochromators. All the measurements were performed without any atmospheric protection or encapsulation of the devices.
3 Results and discussion
3.1 Photophysical properties in chloroform
Spectroscopical studies of the dyads DHPF and DHPcF have clarified the mechanism of intramolecular photoinduced electron transfer from porphyrin or phthalocyanine to C60 with high efficiency and exceptionally long lifetime of the charge separated state.21 Steady-state absorption and emission of the dyads DHPF, DHPcF and their corresponding porphyrin and phthalocyanine references DHP and DHPc were studied in CHCl3 solution (Fig. 2). Fluorescence of porphyrin and phthalocyanine was efficiently quenched in both dyads. The relative quantum yields for DHPF and DHPcF were 4.2% and 1.1%, referred to those of DHP or DHPc, respectively (Table 1). The fluorescence emission (Fig. 2a and b) and excitation spectra (Fig. 2c and d) of DHPF and DHPcF had broadened and red-shifted bands compared to the fluorescence and absorption spectra of the reference compounds. These results indicate the formation of exciplexes preceding the photoinduced electron transfer from porphyrin or phthalocyanine to C60, and are in agreement with the earlier reports.4,19,21

Emission intensities of the dyad compounds are multiplied by 100. Fluorescence excitation spectra of (c) DHPF and DHP (λmon = 650 nm), and (d) DHPcF and DHPc (λmon = 780 nm). 
The fluorescence decay of DHP is mono-exponential throughout the measured range, while the decay of DHPF can be analyzed as a two-exponential sum. The relative contribution of the two lifetimes varies with wavelength (Table 1). Significantly shorter lifetime of DHPF referred to DHP is another evidence of efficient electron transfer from porphyrin to C60. It should be noted that the quality of the fit improved when a third component was added to the model. The third lifetime is similar to the singlet state of DHP (7.7 ns), and thus, could be associated to a minor amount of free porphyrin in the DHPF sample. Due to the low fluorescence signal intensities in DHPF, the longest component can be just an artifact from the background as well. The fluorescence decay curves at selected wavelengths, convoluted fits, and decay associated component spectra are available in the ESI.†
Rate constants of the intramolecular electron transfervia an exciplex, obtained by using transient absorption and fluorescence up-conversion methods, have independently been reported earlier for both DHPF and DHPcF.4,19 Formation of an exciplex has been observed at 780 nm for the DHPF in a benzonitrile solution.4 Fluorescence up-conversion experiments proved the emission of an exciplex at 730 nm for DHPcF in benzonitrile.19 Comparison of the reported values for reaction rates revealed that the transition from the excited singlet state to the exciplex is an order of magnitude faster in DHPF than in DHPcF. The reactions proceed from the exciplex to the charge-separated (CS) state with roughly equal rates in both dyads but the recombination of the CS state to the ground state is an order of magnitude slower for DHPF. Based on these remarks, DHPF seems better suited for photovoltaic applications from a kinetic point of view, although phthalocyanines have preferable absorption profiles. A single-linked dyad (MHPcF) has a more complex reaction scheme due to structural isomers caused by the flexible linker.
3.2 Structure of LS films
The complete Langmuir surface pressure-area isotherm for DHPF is shown in Fig. 3a. The surface pressure starts to rise at the mean molecular area (mma) of about 200 Å2, while mma is roughly 100 Å2 at the deposition surface pressure (12 mN m−1). Additional phase transitions cannot be seen before the collapse above 25 mN m−1. Estimated from a CPK model, the molecular area of tetraphenylporphyrin is 225 Å2.22 Thus, when mma is 150–200 Å2, DHPF can exist as a mutually oriented monolayer, in which the hydrophilic porphyrin moiety is towards water, and the hydrophobic C60 moiety is towards air. The mutual orientation of DHPF molecules in the monolayer is supported also by the earlier studies, in which positive or negative photovoltage signals were obtained by depositing DHPF (10 mol-% in ODA) from air to water or from water to air, respectively, by using the LB-method.5,7,8 Based on the obtained surface pressure-area isotherms, neither DHPcF nor MHPcF condenses to an ideal and uniform monolayer on a Langmuir surface as DHPF does. Mean molecular areas were smaller than expected for phthalocyanines, and almost two times smaller than those for DHPF (ESI†, S2), although the film transfer ratios were close to unity.

(b) Absorption spectra of 7 DHPF layers deposited on an ODA coated quartz substrate one-by-one. Inset: growth of the maximum absorbance with the number of layers. 
In the solid state, the absorption of the Soret band is red-shifted and broadened compared to a concentrated CHCl3 solution (Fig. 3a, inset). This is in line with a recent report about the behavior of another PF compound in the solid state as a self-assembled monolayer.23 Based on the step height measurements with a profilometer (ESI†, S3) and the linear growth of absorbance (Fig. 3b) with the number of layers, the thickness of one LS layer of DHPF is estimated to be 3.1 nm, supporting the monolayer assumption. Although the films have highly reproducible absorption spectra on quartz plates, the roughness may be significantly higher on semiconducting surfaces, e.g.P3HT:PCBM. However, the dyad should keep its tendency to orientate due to the hydrophobic–hydrophobic attractive interaction.
3.3 Photocurrent generation in OSCs
The photovoltaic parameters for the OSCs were initially recorded after the preparation, and again after one year of storage (Fig. 4). The introduction of DHPF between the P3HT:PCBM and Alq3 caused a 0.08 V increase in Voc and 27% enhancement in Jsc, while FF remained almost the same (Table 2). As a consequence, average of η (5 similar devices)increased from 1.5% to 2.2% due to the effect of DHPF monolayers. After one year of storage, the devices showed similar results and thus very promising air stability (Fig. 4d). Surprisingly, the efficiencies were even slightly higher than the earlier ones, mainly due to increases in Voc and FF. Series resistance (RS, inverse slope near Voc) was stable in the dyad containing device, while it had increased clearly in the reference device. Parallel resistance (RP, inverse slope near V = 0) had increased, while Jsc decreased a bit in both cells. In general, storage in a dark ambient atmosphere instead of vacuum or inert gas seems to benefit these samples. This is surprising considering the known poor air-stability of conventional P3HT:PCBM devices equipped with a water soluble PEDOT:PSS polymer as an ITO coating layer and low work function metal cathode without protective encapsulation.24 If properly encapsulated, however, such a device can also give stable output under realistic environmental conditions.13

The results show that oriented molecular layers capable of efficient internal electron transfer can be used to enhance the solar cell performance. It is known that the work function of Au can be modified by depositing self-assembled monolayers of polar molecules onto its surface.25 The observed changes in Jsc and Voc in the device equipped with the dyad monolayer indicate modified work function of the electrode. Although the dyads are not covalently bound to Au, and there is a thin Alq3buffer layer in between them, the dyad can be thought of as an anode coating layer. The increase in Voc can also be attributed to the formation of a dipole between the active layer and interfacial layer, as was discussed recently in the literature.26 Quantum efficiencies (Fig. 4b) revealed an increased photocurrent in the dyad containing device throughout the measured range. The absorbance of the dyad monolayer is negligible (0.02) compared to the absorbance of the whole device (0.4). In a sense, the dyad layer acts like a transparent spacer, improving electrical properties of the interface between the anode and active layer.
Based on the ground and excited state energy levels of the molecules it is clear that electrons do not move spontaneously from DHPF to P3HT. However, due to the presence of C60 in both DHPF and PCBM, their LUMO levels match almost perfectly. Thus, if there are regions on the P3HT:PCBM surface where PCBM is exposed and forms a percolating pathway to the cathode, the scheme supports electron transfer from DHPF to PCBM. On the other hand, the role of P3HT is to transport holes towards the anode. Holes can recombine on the interface with C60˙− of the dyad in its charge separated state (+˙P–C60˙−), and transported to the anode by Alq3.
Another series of solar cells was made in order to compare the performance of DHPF to phthalocyanine–fullerene dyads (Pc–C60). Two such dyads (Fig. 1) were studied, one with two linkers (DHPcF) and another with a single linker (MHPcF). The Pc–C60 dyads improved the photovoltaic performance, although not as much as DHPF (Table 3). The cell with the single-linked dyad, MHPcF, produced practically the same current density as the other devices in the series although Voc was lower. This result can be understood in terms of molecular organization. It has been verified earlier with the AFM studies that DHPcF does not form an ideal molecular sheet when deposited as the 100% LS layer.27 It seems that the efficiency is contributed positively by the dyads and stable molecular dipoles formed under photo-excitation, while the molecular orientation plays an important role as well. The long-term stability of these (ESI†, S4) devices was as good as in the earlier devices (Table 2).

From the photochemical point of view, DHPF has favoured properties for solar energy conversion in comparison to the presented Pc–C60 dyads DHPcF and MHPcF.21 The fast directed photo-induced charge separation and the slow recombination create a long living charged state, which is a fundamental requirement for efficient solar cell material. This scheme enables lateral charge migration (e.g. from C60˙− to C60) in a solid state. In order to verify the effect of DHPF, the photo-current experiments were repeated in optimized OSC devices. The maximum efficiency of 4.18% was achieved (average of 5 devices). It turned out that DHPF outperformed single layers of either porphyrin (TBP), C60, and a double layer of DHPF|TBP (Table 3). In the final series, the content of P3HT was the highest, which can be observed from the absorption spectrum as well (ESI†, S5). This explains the general increase in efficiencies compared to our earlier experiments (Table 2). Internal quantum efficiencies peak close to 100% although the response is weak in the region 700–800 nm, due to a lack of absorption (Fig. 5).

4 Conclusions
Double linked P–C60 and Pc–C60 dyads, DHPF and DHPcF, and a single linked dyad, MHPcF, which are capable of efficient photoinduced electron transfer from porphyrin or from phthalocyanine to C60 were successfully applied as a component in an inverted OSC device. The monolayers were deposited by the LS method on top of a P3HT:PCBM bulk heterojunction in order to modify the interface between the P3HT:PCBM structure and the Alq3|Au anode. Amphiphilic groups at the periphery of the porphyrin ring enable the deposition of a uniform molecular sheet from a Langmuir surface as a mutually oriented layer. The introduction of DHPF as a pure monolayer into the inverted OSC yielded stable results and improved power conversion efficiency. The result is interesting, taking into account that the thickness of such a layer is minor (3 nm) compared to the typical thickness of P3HT:PCBM (50–150 nm). The electron transfer from porphyrin to C60 is expected to enhance the overall build-in electrical field between the electrodes and thus increase Voc. The dyad layer can be considered as a stable dipole sheet, which enhances the conductivity of electrons in the chemically defined direction under illumination. In our comparison of different dyads in solar cell devices, DHPcF revealed almost as high an efficiency as DHPF, while MHPcF showed lower Voc. This result can be attributed to molecular orientation and the number of linkers.
The presented types of the D–A dyads with the enhanced film formation properties are promising candidates for organic electronics. Such organized D–A monolayers may provide interesting building blocks for tandem-type solar cells, sensitive photo-detectors, and other organic photo-devices. With modifications of the chemical structure and by using different film deposition methods, the dyads can be attached onto a variety of solid surfaces to further increase their capability as functional coating layers in different applications.
