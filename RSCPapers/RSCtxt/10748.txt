    , Accepted 9th October 2012First published on 9th October 2012AbstractReplacing benzodithiophene (BDT) with a naphthodithiophene (NDT) building block, PNDTDPP exhibited enhanced photovoltaic performance with a PCE of 5.37% when compared with BDT-based copolymer PBDDPP, which gave a PCE of 2.91% in conventional device structures. Encouragingly, the obtained inverted PSC with PBDDPP achieved an impressively high PCE of 6.92%.
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) have attracted considerable attention as a promising energy resource due to their unique advantages for obtaining low-cost, lightweight, large-area and flexible devices through ink-jet printing and roll to roll solution processes.1 In the past decade, tremendous efforts on low band gap (LGB) polymers and their typical bulk heterojunction (BHJ) devices have been devoted to improve the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) from around 1% to over 9%.2 Among the various LGB conjugated polymers, diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP)-based copolymers have emerged as extremely interesting materials in both PSC and field effect transistor (FET) applications.3 The DPP unit has a planar and well-conjugated skeleton, which gives rise to strong π–π interaction, broad red-shifted absorption as well as high carrier mobility,4 and the lactam structure endows it with high electron affinity.5 Using DPP units as electron acceptor blocks, Janssen et al. reported a LGB thieno[3,2-b]thiophene-DPP-based copolymer with a high hole mobility of 1.95 cm2 V−1 s−1 and a PCE of 5.4% in BHJ solar cells when blending with [6,6]phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM).6 Fréchet et al. firstly inserted furans into the backbone of DPP-based copolymers with efficient solar cell performance.7 Modulating the size and branching of the side chains of this type of copolymers could significantly improve polymer solubility, control structural order and increase the PCEs up to 6.5%.8 Recently, Yang et al. systematically investigated benzodithiophene (BDT) and diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP)-based copolymers applied in tandem solar cells with high efficiencies over 8%.2i,9 Except for tandem solar cells, most of the typical BHJ solar cells mentioned above using DPP-based copolymers as donor materials showed relatively low open-circuit voltages (Voc) below 0.7 eV because of their high HOMO energy levels. The most efficient strategy to achieving a deep HOMO level of photovoltaic copolymers is to increase the numbers of phenyl cycles in the polymer main chains, such as benzene, fluorene, carbazole units and so on.5,10 However, it will decrease the conjugation length and inhibit the π-delocalization of the conjugated system, resulting in a relatively wider band gap, poorer charge transport as well as lower short-circuit current (Jsc). Thus, it still remains a challenge to develop new DPP-based copolymers for high performance PSCs with improved Voc, Jsc and fill factor (FF) simultaneously.
Herein, we firstly reported the use of electron-rich naphthodithiophene (NDT) as a new donor block in DPP-based copolymers (PNDTDPP) for efficient PSCs (Scheme 1). Benzodithiophene (BDT)–DPP copolymer (PBDTDPP) was also synthesised for the purpose of comparison. Compared with benzodithiophene (BDT), NBT has an extended π-system and larger planar heteroarene structure, which will stimulate highly ordered π–π stacking between the polymer main chains and minimize steric repulsions of thiophene with the DPP core. Such a high coplanarity is beneficial for charge separation and transport, energy level tunability as well as stronger hybridisation of the molecular orbitals for building LGB photovoltaic copolymers. Actually, Takimiya et al. demonstrated that small molecules11 and polymers12 containing the naphthodithiophene cores exhibit high FET mobilities. Although they found that polythiophenes incorporating angular-shaped NDT units can form more ordered edge-on molecular orientation,11b the linear-fused NDT units were still chosen in this work because they had no twist structures to affect the coplanarity of the building blocks, including DPP and the neighboring thiophene moieties. On the other hand, this strategy may be helpful to enhance the cofacial π–π stacking properties of the polymer backbones. As expected, the PNDTDPP solar cells exhibit enhanced open-circuit voltages, fill factors and improved PCE of 5.37% and 6.92% in conventional and inverted devices without loss of short-circuit currents.
 Scheme 1  Synthesis routes of PBDTDPP and PNDTDPP. 
The synthetic route of the relevant monomers and copolymers is depicted in Scheme 1. The copolymers containing BDT and NDT blocks, PBDTDPP and PNDTDPP, were prepared through Stille-coupling polymerization with good yields using Pd2(dba)3/P(o-tolyl)3 as catalysts. Detailed procedures of synthesis of copolymers are described in the ESI.† Both polymers were readily soluble in common organic solvents, such as toluene, chloroform, chlorobenzene, dichlorobenzene, etc. Glass transition temperatures were not observed in both cases from differential scanning calorimetry analysis. Good thermal stabilities with decomposition temperature up to 400 °C (5% weight loss) were investigated by thermal gravimetric analysis, which are adequately suitable for PSC fabrications and evaluations. As determined by gel permeation chromatography using chloroform as the eluent, PBDTDPP has a number-average molecular weight (Mn) of 45.2 kDa and a polydispersity index (PDI) of 2.89, while PNDTDPP has a Mn of 31.6 kDa and a PDI of 2.55.
The UV-vis-NIR absorption spectra of both polymers in chloroform solutions (1 × 10−5 M) and thin solid films are shown in Fig. 1a. Both copolymers possess broad absorption bands in the visible region and NIR region. Shorter and longer wavelength peaks are attributed to the π–π* transition band and intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) between donors and acceptors, which is the typical feature of the D–A conjugated systems.2b,13 Going from solution to the solid state, the maximum peaks are almost the same, signifying easy aggregation of the two polymer main chains even in dilute solution. As shown in Fig. 1a, PBDTDPP and PNDTDPP have absorption peaks at 760 and 754 nm with the absorption onset at 936 and 912 nm, which determines the corresponding optical band gaps to be 1.32 and 1.36 eV, respectively. Because of the weaker electron-donating property of the NDT unit as compared to the BDT moiety, PNDTDPP shows a slightly higher band gap than PBDTDPP. However, the absorption feature is broader and more intense in PNDTDPP, which is helpful to harvest more photons and enhance the Jsc of PSCs. The HOMO and LUMO levels of PBDTDPP and PNDTDPP were measured by cyclic voltammetry (CV) (Fig. 1b and Fig. S1, ESI†). Replacing BDT with NDT, PNDTDPP exhibits deeper HOMO and LUMO energy levels of −5.33 and −3.74 eV than polymer PBDTDPP. The obtained ideal HOMO level will lead to higher Voc in PSCs, while the low-lying LUMO will increase the stability of the LGB copolymers and their photovoltaic devices.14

The crystallinity and molecular ordering of the copolymers were investigated by using an X-ray diffractometer (XRD) (Fig. S2, ESI†). Both copolymers have three peaks which correspond to interlayer d-spacing and π–π stacking. The distinct primary strong peaks (100) at 4.5° and 4.8° for PBDTDPP and PNDTDPP correspond to a d-spacing of 19.8 and 18.5 Å, respectively, which is related to the lamellar-like ordering of the aromatic polymer backbones, separated by disordered alkyl side chains. As compared to PBDTDPP, PNDTDPP shows a shorter d-spacing, which is most likely due to the relaxed and crisscrossed arrangements of dodecyloxyl side chains on different phenyl cycles of NDT. The relatively broad diffraction peaks (010) ranging from 20° to 26° indicate that these copolymers are not highly crystalline. The diffraction peaks (010) located at 22.8° and 23.1° for PBDTDPP and PNDTDPP can be assigned to the face to face packing distances of 4.1 and 3.8 Å, respectively. PNDTDPP also has a shorter cofacial distance than PBDTDPP because the π-extended and larger planar NDT unit induces larger van der Waals force and stronger π–π interaction of the polymer backbone. Thus, PNDTDPP is expected to have higher mobility than polymer PBDTDPP, which is favorable for enhanced carrier transport, larger Jsc and more efficient PCEs in polymer solar cells. This was further verified by the mobility measurements using the space charge limited current (SCLC) model. As expected, PNDTDPP had a much higher hole mobility than PBDTDPP. The hole mobilities were 9.70 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 for PNDTDPP and 4.43 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for PBDTDPP (Fig. S3, ESI†).
The photovoltaic properties of both polymers were investigated in a general device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC71BM/Ca/Al. During the preliminary device optimization process, PSCs were constructed in 1,2-dichlorobenzene solvent with different copolymer/PC71BM weight ratios from 1:1 to 1:4. The devices with a 1:1.5 ratio provided the most promising results. As shown in Fig. 2a, The best cell based on PBDTDPP:PC71BM (1:1.5) showed a Jsc of 8.63 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.67 V, and an FF of 0.50, resulting in a PCE of 2.91%, which is comparable to those values obtained from previous literatures.5,15 However, the PNDTDPP:PC71BM (1:1.5) device exhibited improved performance with a Voc of 0.77 V, a Jsc of 11.89 mA cm−2, and an FF of 0.59, giving rise to a PCE of 5.37%. It should be noted that this value is one of the top high PCEs in DPP-based copolymers without anymore careful and systematic optimization, such as adding some additives and controlling thermal annealing temperatures.3 The enhanced efficiency can be attributed to the pronounced higher hole mobility and lower HOMO energy level obtained by optical, XRD, and SCLC results. This was also further verified by external quantum efficiency (EQE) (Fig. 2b) and surface morphology (Fig. S4, ESI†) studies of the blend mixtures. The PNDTDPP:PC71BM device exhibited a broader and higher response range in agreement with the larger Jsc, extending from 300 to 1100 nm, whereas the PBDTDPP:PC71BM device exhibited a relatively narrower and lower response. The morphology of the PNDTDPP:PC71BM blending film by AFM possesses a more uniform and bicontinuous network with finer nanoscale feature than that of the PBDTDPP:PC71BM film, which can help to enhance hole and/or electron drift length and increase photocurrent with strong electric field dependence, resulting in high FF values of the relevant devices.16

PSCs were then fabricated using PNDTDPP:PC71BM blends (1:1.5) as active layers in an inverted device architecture of ITO/ZnO/PNFBr/PNDTDPP: PC71BM/MoO3/Ag because of the long-term stability compared to the conventional structure. In order to achieve a good contact and improved electronic conductivity, the ZnO layer was pretreated with UV-ozone for 10 minutes before the conjugated polyelectrolyte of poly[(9,9-bis(3′-(N,N-dimethylamino) propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene)] dibromide (PNFBr) was spin-coated.2f,g,17 Encouragingly, the inverted device exhibited a high PCE of 6.92% with a Voc of 0.76 V, a Jsc of 13.34 mA cm−2, and an FF of 0.68 (Fig. 1a). Although the Voc is almost the same compared to the conventional device, the Jsc and FF have been increased to a large extent, which is verified by the improved EQE response as shown in Fig. 2b. The Jsc calculated from integration of the EQE with an AM1.5G reference spectrum also agrees well with the Jsc obtained from the J–V measurement within 5% error.
In conclusion, DPP-based copolymers containing BDT and NDT donor blocks, PBDTDPP and PNDTDPP, were developed for PSC applications. Compared with BDT, π-extended NBT has a larger planar heteroarene structure, resulting in highly ordered π–π stacking and minimized steric repulsions of the two thiophene groups with the DPP core. As expected, PNDTDPP shows enhanced absorption, higher hole mobility as well as low-lying HOMO and LUMO energy levels, which is beneficial for improving Jsc, Voc and FF in PSCs. The NDT-based copolymer exhibited a much higher solar cell performance than PBDTDPP in conventional devices without further optimization, with a PCE of 5.37%. Encouragingly, the inverted device with PNDTDPP:PC71BM (1:1.5) as an active layer and the UV-ozone pretreated and PNFBr modified ZnO film as an electron-transporting layer were also fabricated and investigated. The obtained inverted polymer solar cell achieved an impressively high PCE of 6.92% under AM 1.5G illumination at 100 mW cm−2. This value is among the highest efficiencies for inverted devices incorporating LBG conjugated copolymers.
