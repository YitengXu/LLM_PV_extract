Copolymers with higher FBSe ratios were found to have narrower Eg, and higher-lying EHOMO. Because of the size and electronegativity differences of the selenium and sulfur atoms, the FBSe:FBT ratio further affects the structural regularity of the conjugated chains, and their self-assembly behaviors. DSC results indicated that P1, which has the most irregular FBSe:FBT sequence along the backbone showed the lowest Tm. Interestingly, XRD results showed that the main-chain irregularity degrades the order of the lamellar stacking, but not the order of π-stacking. The random ternary copolymers, P1 and P2, possess more ordered π-stacking than the alternating copolymers, PTh4FBSe and PTh4FBT. The highest OFET μh of 0.46 cm2 V−1 s−1 was delivered by P1, which has the smallest dπ–π among the copolymers. In the polymer:PC71BM blend films, the FBSe containing copolymers have good miscibility in PC71BM. The degree of phase separation of PTh4FBSe:PC71BM can be enhanced by DIO additive, but it is not effective for the random ternary copolymers. The highest PCE of 6.06% with Voc of 0.64 V, Jsc of 15.3 mA cm−2, and FF of 61.8% was delivered by the PTh4FBSe:PC71BM PSCs.
Introduction
Low band-gap (LBG) conjugated copolymers consisting of an electron-rich donor unit (D) and an electron-deficient acceptor unit (A) have been developed as high-performance materials used in bulk heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells (PSCs).1–5 Rapid developments in the polymer design enabled the adjustments of the highest occupied molecular orbital level (EHOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital level (ELUMO) of the LBG copolymers. Combining the suitable EHOMO and ELUMO of the LBG copolymer, appropriate device design and morphological optimization, BHJ PSCs have reached power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) over 8%.6–19
Recently, random copolymerization has been developed as a versatile strategy to further adjust the properties of D–A copolymers. The D–A random copolymers were generally prepared either by copolymerizing two different D units with one A unit,19–22 or by copolymerizing two different A units with one D unit.23–29 Compared to the alternating D–A copolymers, which contain only two monomeric units, the additional monomeric units in the ternary random copolymers provide extra flexibility to adjust the polymer properties. Different ternary random copolymers have been synthesized to either broaden the absorption spectrum,19 modulate the EHOMO and ELUMO positions,23 or to control the solid-state morphology.22 Over 7% PCEs have been reported in the single-junction BHJ PSCs of several random D–A copolymers, and a PCE of over 8.5% has also been reported in our previous study using the prophyrin-containing random copolymers.19
Although the versatility of random copolymerization has been confirmed, because the reaction brings both irregularity to the chemical structure and randomness to the chain sequence along the conjugated backbone, fundamental questions about how these molecular parameters influence the solid-state morphology and device performances of the random D–A copolymers remain an interesting issue to be explored. A suitable acceptor pair for the study of the influences of the backbone randomness is fluorinated benzothiadiazole (FBT) and fluorinated benzoselenadiazole (FBSe). Unlike most ternary random copolymers containing two A units with very different structures, FBSe and FBT have very similar chemical structures. Thus, when randomly copolymerized, the overall chemical structure of the random copolymers will not be significantly altered with the FBSe:FBT ratios. However, because the selenium atom (Se) and the sulfur atom (S) are different in their electronegativity and sizes,30–35 changing the FBSe:FBT ratio in the ternary random copolymers can still change the polymer properties and bring the sequential randomness into the conjugated backbone. In general, the FBSe-based copolymers36–38 have smaller Eg,39–42 but higher-lying EHOMO than the FBT-based copolymers,43–46 because the Se-containing unit is more polarized than its S analogue and possesses more quinoidal character.47 Currently, the FBSe-based copolymers have delivered a promising PCE of 5.74% in the literature. Adjusting the FBT/FBSe ratio in a ternary random copolymer may optimize the polymer properties, and provide information about how the backbone randomness affects the solid-state structures of the random copolymers. Thus, in this study, a series of LBG copolymers, which contain FBSe and FBT as a pair of A units and 5,5′-dibromo-4,4′-bis(2-octyldodecyl)-2,2′-bithiophene as the D unit, were synthesized to investigate the influences of the FBSe:FBT ratio on the polymer properties, solid-state behaviors and device performances. As shown in Scheme 1, the FBSe:FBT ratios are 100:0 for PTh4FBSe, 50:50 for P1, and 25:75 for P2. UV-Vis spectra and electrochemical cyclic voltammetry (CV) were used to evaluate influences of the FBSe:FBT ratio on the EHOMO, ELUMO and Eg. The phase behavior and the phase structure of the copolymers were investigated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and X-ray diffractometry. The morphology of the copolymer/PCBM blend films and the influences of the diiodooctane (DIO) additive were observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The FBSe:FBT ratio showed obvious influences on the properties and solid-state morphologies of the copolymers. The highest OFET hole mobility (μh) of 0.46 cm2 V−1 s−1 was delivered by P1, which has the smallest dπ–π, while the highest PCE of 6.06% with Voc of 0.64 V, Jsc of 15.3 mA cm−2, and FF of 61.8% was delivered by the PTh4FBSe:PC71BM PSCs because of the suitable degree of phase segregation in the blend thin film.

Experimental section
General measurement and characterization
All chemicals were purchased from Aldrich, Lancaster, TCI or Acros and used as received unless otherwise specified. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded using a 400 and 75 MHz instrument spectrometer. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was performed on a TAQ200 Series DSC operated at a scan rate of 10 °C min−1. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed using a Perkin Elmer Pyris under a nitrogen atmosphere at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. UV-Vis spectra were recorded using an HP 8453 spectrophotometer. The electrochemical cyclic voltammetry (CV) was conducted on a CH Instruments Model 611D. Carbon glass coated with a thin polymer film was used as the working electrode and the Ag/Ag+ electrode as the reference electrode, while 0.1 M tetrabutylammoniumhexafluorophosphate (Bu4NPF6) in acetonitrile was the electrolyte. CV curves were calibrated using ferrocene as the standard, whose oxidation potential is set at −4.8 eV with respect to the zero vacuum level. The EHOMO were deduced from the equation: EHOMO = −e(Eonsetox − Eonset(ferrocene) + 4.8) eV. The ELUMO levels of the polymer were deduced from the equation: ELUMO = −e(Eonsetred − Eonset(ferrocene) + 4.8) eV. For X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns, a Bruker APEX DUO Single Crystal X-Ray Diffractometer with a microfocus air-cooled sealed Cu tube source, 50 watts, (50 kV, 1 mA; Kα radiation 0.1542 nm) and an APEXII CCD camera was used. For the 2D WAXD analysis, the fiber samples were prepared by extruding the polymers through a pin-hole (diameter: 1 mm) at 200 °C. The fiber samples were then exposed to the X-ray (beam size: 0.3 mm). The exposure time to obtain high-quality patterns was 40 seconds.
OFET device fabrication and characterization
An n-type heavily doped Si wafer with a SiO2 layer of 300 nm and a capacitance of 11 nF cm−2 was used as the gate electrode and a dielectric layer. Thin films (40–60 nm in thickness) of polymers were deposited on ODTS treated SiO2/Si substrates by spin-coating their o-DCB solution (5 mg mL−1). The thin films were annealed at 200 °C or 250 °C for 10 minutes. A gold source and drain contacts (40 nm in thickness) were deposited by vacuum evaporation on the organic layer through a shadow mask, affording a bottom-gate, top-contact OFET device. Electrical measurements of the OFET devices were carried out at room temperature in air using a 4156C Semiconductor Parameter Analyzer, Agilent Technologies. The field-effect mobility was calculated in the saturation regime by using the equation: Ids = (μWCi/2L)(Vg – Vt)2, where Ids is the drain-source current, μ is the field-effect mobility, W is the channel width (1 mm), L is the channel length (0.1 mm), Ci is the capacitance per unit area of the gate dielectric layer, Vg is the gate voltage and Vt is the threshold voltage.
BHJ PSC fabrication and characterization
The device structure for inverted PSCs was ITO/ZnO/polymer:PC71BM/MoO3/Ag. The ITO glass substrates were cleaned with detergent, deionized water, acetone, and isopropyl alcohol in an ultrasonic bath and then dried overnight in an oven at >100 °C. For the inverted PSCs, zinc acetate dihydrate (Aldrich) dissolved in 2-methoxyethanol (100 mg mL−1) and a small amount of ethanolamine was spin-casted on pre-cleaned ITO substrates and baked at 160 °C for 10 minutes in air to form the ZnO layer with a thickness of 40 nm. Copolymers were dissolved in chlorobenzene (CB) containing 3 vol% DIO. PC71BM (purchased from Nano-C) was then added into the solution to reach the desired weight ratio. The solution was stirred at 70 °C overnight and filtered through a 0.45 μm filter. In a glove box, the solution of polymer:PC71BM was then spin coated to form the active layer. The anode made of MoO3 (7 nm) and Ag (150 nm) was evaporated through a shadow mask under vacuum (<10−6 Torr). Each sample consisted of four independent pixels defined by an active area of 0.04 cm2. The devices were characterized in air under 100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5 simulated light measurement (Yamashita Denso solar simulator). Current–voltage (J–V) characteristics of PSC devices were obtained by using a Keithley 2400 SMU. Solar illumination conforming to the JIS Class AAA was provided by using a SAN-EI 300W solar simulator equipped with an AM 1.5G filter. The light intensity was calibrated with a Hamamatsu S1336-5BK silicon photodiode.
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)
TEM observations were performed in bright-field, high-resolution mode on a JEOL JEM-2010 transmission electron microscope with an accelerating voltage of 200 kV equipped with a Gatan-831 CCD camera. The thin-film sample was first spin-coated onto an ITO substrate covered with 40 nm of PEDOT:PSS. The sample was then immersed in water to dissolve the PEDOT:PSS layer and separate the thin films from the ITO substrate. Thin films floated on a water surface were picked up by copper grids coated with an amorphous carbon layer, dried under vacuum overnight, and used in the TEM observations.
Synthesis of DTFBSe
To a round bottom flask were added 5,6-difluoro-4,7-diiodobenzo-2,1,3-selenadiazole (1.5 g, 3.18 mmol), Pd(PPh3)4 (290 mg, 0.251 mmol) and degassed DMF (50 mL). The solution was stirred at 60 °C until all the substances completely dissolved. 2-(Tributylstannyl)thiophene (2.76 g, 7.4 mmol) was added dropwise and the mixture was kept at 120 °C for 20 h. Then, the mixture was poured into water and extracted with dichloromethane, before being dried over anhydrous MgSO4. After concentration, the residue was purified by column chromatography using hexane and dichloromethane (v/v = 4:1) as the eluent to afford an orange solid (0.66 g, yield 54%). 1H NMR (CDCl3, 400 MHz, δ): 7.27 (d, J = 4.8 Hz, 2H), 7.63 (d, J = 5.2 Hz, 2H), 8.18 (d, J = 4 Hz, 2H); 13C NMR (CDCl3, 75 MHz, δ): 112.38, 127.24, 129.04, 129.06, 129.08, 130.92, 130.97, 131.02, 131.70, 149.09, 149.31, 151.70, 151.92, 154.30; Anal. calcd for C14H6F2N2S2Se: C 43.87, H 1.58, N 7.31; found: C 44.12, H 1.81, N 7.11.
Synthesis of 5,6-difluoro-4,7-bis(5-(trimethylstannyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo-2,1,3-selenodiazole (A1)
To a solution of compound DTFBSe (320 mg, 0.83 mmol) in dry THF (50 mL) was added a 2 M solution of lithium diisopropylamide in THF (1.08 mL, 2.16 mmol) dropwise at −78 °C. After stirring at −78 °C for 1 h, a 1.0 M solution of chlorotrimethylstannane in THF (2.16 mL, 2.16 mmol) was introduced by syringe into the solution. The mixture solution was warmed up to room temperature and stirred for 20 h. The mixture solution was extracted with diethyl ether (50 mL × 3) and water (50 mL). The solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure and the product was obtained by recrystallization from methanol. Yield: 300 mg (51%). 1H NMR (CDCl3, 400 MHz, δ): 0.44 (s, 18H), 7.34 (d, J = 3.6 Hz, 2H), 8.22 (d, J = 3.6 Hz, 2H).
Synthesis of PTh4FBSe
To a 50 mL round bottom flask were added compound A1 (85.3 mg, 0.129 mmol), 5,5′-dibromo-4,4′-bis(2-octyldodecyl)-2,2′-bithiophene (D1) (114 mg, 0.129 mmol), tris(dibenzylideneacetone)dipalladium (5.9 mg, 0.0065 mmol), tri(2-methylphenyl)phosphine (15.7 mg, 0.052 mmol) and deoxygenated chlorobenzene (5 mL). The mixture was then degassed by bubbling nitrogen for 10 minutes at room temperature. The round bottom flask was put into the microwave reactor and heated to 180 °C under 270 watts for 50 minutes. Then, tributyl(thiophen-2-yl)stannane (10.5 mg, 0.028 mmol) was added to the mixture solution and reacted for 10 minutes under 270 W. Finally, 2-bromothiophene (20 mg, 0.123 mmol) was added to the mixture solution and reacted for 10 minutes under 270 W. After cooling to room temperature the solution was added dropwise to methanol. The precipitate was collected by filtration and washed by Soxhlet extraction with acetone (24 h) and hexane (24 h) sequentially. The residue solid was re-dissolved in hot toluene (100 mL). The Pd-thiol gel (Silicycle Inc.) was added to the above toluene solution to remove the residual Pd catalyst at 60 °C for 12 h. After filtration of the solution and removal of the solvent under reduced pressure, the polymer solution was added into methanol to re-precipitate. The purified polymer was collected by filtration and dried under vacuum for 1 day to give a black solid. Yield: 100 mg (50.2%). 1H NMR (CDCl3, 400 MHz, δ): 0.86 (br, 12H), 1.25 (br, 64H), 1.77 (br, 2H), 2.78 (br, 4H), 6.98–7.01 (br, 4H), 8.16 (br, 2H); Anal. calcd: C 67.29, H 8.02, N 2.53, S 11.59; found: C 66.76, H 7.34, N 2.66, S 11.75.

Using a procedure similar to that described above for PTh4FBSe, a mixture of A1 (43.04 mg, 0.06 mmol), A2 (40.2 mg, 0.06 mmol), D1 (107.5 mg, 0.12 mmol), tris(dibenzylideneacetone)dipalladium (5.56 mg, 0.0061 mmol), tri(2-methylphenyl)phosphine (14.8 mg, 0.049 mmol) in deoxygenated chlorobenzene (5 mL) was polymerized to give P1. Yield: 63 mg (47.8%). 1H NMR (CDCl3, 400 MHz, δ): 0.86 (br, 12H), 1.26 (br, 64H), 1.77 (br, 2H), 2.79 (br, 4H), 6.98–7.03 (br, 4H), 8.17–8.29 (br, 2H); Anal. calcd: C 68.75, H 8.19, N 2.59, S 13.32; found: C 67.24, H 7.50, N 2.81, S 13.35.

Results and discussion
Synthesis and thermal analysis
As shown in Scheme 1, to obtain the FBSe alternating copolymer (PTh4FBSe) and the FBSe:FBT ternary random copolymers (P1 and P2), the monomer 5,6-difluoro-4,7-bis(5-(trimethylstannyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo-2,1,3-selenodiazole (A1) was first synthesized according to Scheme 1b. The Stille-coupling of 5,6-difluoro-4,7-diiodobenzo-2,1,3-selenodiazole and 2-(tributylstannyl)thiophene afforded the formation of DTFBSe in 68% yield. A1 was synthesized by reacting the lithiated DTFBSe with trimethyltin chloride in 54% yield. 5,6-Difluoro-4,7-bis(5-(trimethylstannyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo-2,1,3-thiadiazole (A2) and 5,5′-dibromo-4,4′-bis(2-octyldodecyl)-2,2′-bithiophene (D1) were synthesized via reported methods.48 Then, PTh4FBSe was synthesized by the copolymerization between A1 and D1via Stille coupling. The ternary random copolymers, P1 and P2, were prepared by the copolymerization of the mixtures of A1, A2 and D1. The molar ratios were A1:A2:D1 = 1:1:2 for P1 and A1:A2:D1 = 1:3:4 for P2. The FBSe:FBT feed ratios of PTh4FBSe, P1 and P2 are thus 100:0, 50:50 and 25:75. The sulfur content in the polymers obtained from the elemental analysis is 11.75% for PTh4FBSe, 13.35% for P1 and 14.25% for P2. The content closely matches with the calculated values and gives a clear indication about the FBSe:FBT ratios of the copolymers. The copolymers (PTh4FBSe, P1 and P2) were completely soluble in chloroform, chlorobenzene (CB), and o-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB). The number average molecular weights (Mn) of PTh4FBSe and P1 were 15.4 kDa (PDI = 1.72) and 12.3 kDa (PDI = 1.83), respectively, as determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC). The molecular weight of P2 was not obtainable from the GPC measurement due to its poor solubility in THF.

PTh4FBSe, P1 and P2 exhibited good thermal stability with decomposition temperature (Td) around 400 °C determined from thermogravimetric analysis (Fig. S2†). In the DSC analysis (Fig. S3†), the melting temperature (Tm) of PTh4FBSe, P1 and P2 is 259 °C, 251 °C and 272 °C, respectively. The transition peaks of PTh4FBSe and P2 are also sharper than that of P1. The different phase behaviors of the copolymers are related to the FBSe:FBT ratio. The highest Tm of P2 suggests that a higher FBT content prompts the Tm of the copolymer. Moreover, the FBSe/FBT sequence along the conjugated backbone has a non-negligible effect on the phase stability. Although P1 has a higher FBT ratio than PTh4FBSe, its broad phase transition at lower temperatures indicates that the backbone randomness decreases the transition temperature and the stability of the ordered phase.
Optical absorption and frontier orbital levels

Fig. 1 displays the UV-Vis absorption spectra of the copolymers in o-DCB and thin films; Table 1 summarizes the optical data, including the absorption peak wavelengths (λmaxs), absorption edges (λonsets), and optical band gaps (Egs) of the copolymers. In solution (Fig. 1a), the absorption bands at λmax around 420 nm can be attributed to the localized π–π* transitions and the absorption bands at λmax around 580 nm were attributed to the photo-induced intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) between the electron-rich quaterthiophene units and electron-deficient FBT or FBSe units. As shown in Fig. 1b, the absorption bands bathochromically shift when the copolymers are spin-casted into the film. The low-energy absorption shoulders with λmax located at 721 nm (PTh4FBSe), 695 nm (P1) and 687 nm (P2) indicate a better backbone co-planarity and stronger intermolecular interactions of the conjugated chains in the thin film. The major influence of the FBSe:FBT ratio is on the Eg of the copolymer. Deduced from the absorption edges of the thin film spectra, the Egs are 1.55 eV for PTh4FBSe, 1.58 eV for P1 and 1.62 eV for P2. Thus, a decrease in the FBSe content widens the Eg of the copolymers. Cyclic voltammetry (Fig. S1a†) was performed for each copolymer to obtain information about their EHOMO and ELUMO levels. The relevant electrochemical properties are summarized in Table 1. Comparing the EHOMOs and ELUMOs of the copolymers, it was found that the decreased FBSe content drops the EHOMO, but elevates the ELUMO of the copolymers as shown in Fig. S1b.† Thus, modulation of the EHOMOs, ELUMOs and Egs of copolymers can be reached via the control of the FBSe:FBT ratio.

X-ray structural characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis of the copolymers (Fig. 2) was carried out to identify how the FBSe:FBT ratio affects the solid-state packing of the copolymers. To give a comprehensive comparison, PTh4FBT from our previous study46 is also incorporated into the discussion. All copolymers form a long-range ordered lamellar structure (d-spacing of 2.07 nm), and ordered π–π stacking in the solid-state, as indicated by the three diffraction peaks indexed as the (100), (200), and (300) diffractions in a low angle region, and an additional diffraction at around 23.7° (d-spacing ∼0.37 nm). The π–π stacking distances (dπ–πs) are 0.374 nm for PTh4FBSe and P2; 0.368 nm for P1; and 0.370 nm for PTh4FBT.
 Fig. 2  Powder XRD patterns of the FBSe:FBT copolymers. 
Fig. S5† shows the 2D WAXS pattern of the extruded samples. The chain axis (c-axis) of the copolymers is aligned along the shear direction. Therefore, the Bragg diffractions along the equator can be used to identify the diffractions from the lamellar structure (indexed as (100) in the figures), and the π–π stacking.49 To make a reasonable comparison, the sample diameter was controlled by the size of the pinhole on the extruder (1 mm) and the exposure time was fixed for the four samples. The scattering halo from the alkyl side chains was clearly found at 2θ = 19.2° (d-spacing of 0.47 nm). Because the four polymers have the same alkyl side chains, the scattering intensities from the amorphous side chains are similar in the four diffraction patterns shown in Fig. S5.† However, the integration of the diffraction peaks along the equator (Fig. S6†) shows the differences in the diffraction intensities of the (100) and π–π peaks of the four copolymers. For the (100) diffraction, the intensities of the copolymers are in the order of PTh4FBT > P2 > PTh4FBSe > P1, and for the π–π diffraction, the intensity is in the order of P1 > P2 > PTh4FBSe ∼ PTh4FBT. The result is in accordance with the powder XRD patterns shown in Fig. 2. Thus, the XRD results indicate that the FBSe:FBT ratio does not affect the lamellar spacing, but does influence the order of the lamellar structure and the dπ–π of the copolymers. Copolymers with higher FBT content (PTh4FBT and P2) generated sharper (100) diffractions than those with higher FBSe content. Since the sharpness of the diffraction is related to the correlation length of crystalline domain according to the Scherrer equation, the order of the lamellar structure is therefore lower in the copolymers with higher FBSe content (PTh4FBSe) and higher backbone randomness (P1). However, to the π-stacking, the backbone randomness shows an opposite effect. The alternative copolymers – PTh4FBSe and PTh4FBT gave lower diffraction intensities for the π–π stacking than the random ternary copolymers – P1 and P2. Moreover, P1, which has the most random backbone, gave the most intense π-stacking diffraction and the shortest dπ–π of 0.368 nm. Because the four copolymers are different in their FBSe:FBT ratio, or more specifically speaking, in the content and the arrangement of the selenium (Se)/sulfur (S) atoms, the result was rational based on the steric effect of the Se atom and the intermolecular interaction strength of the FBSe unit. On the one hand, the atom size of Se is larger than S. Comparing the dπ–π of PTh4FBSe (0.374 nm) and PTh4FBT (0.370 nm), it can be found that the larger atomic size of Se causes steric hindrance, and expands the dπ–π of PTh4FBSe.50 On the other hand, due to the lower electronegativity of selenium, the FBSe unit actually possesses a higher dipole moment (Fig. S4†) for the stronger intermolecular interaction.46 Therefore, in the case of P2, the low FBSe content enhanced the interchain interaction and consequently increased the π-stacking diffraction intensity. A further increase in the FBSe content resulted in an even stronger π-stacking diffraction and a shorter dπ–π of P1. Therefore, the π-stacking order of the FBSe:FBT copolymers was affected both by the steric effect and the strength of the intermolecular interaction.
OFET performances
The charge transport properties of the FBSe:FBT copolymers were investigated in OFET devices with a bottom-gate, top-contact configuration. The output and transfer plots of the devices exhibited typical p-channel OFET characteristics (Fig. 3). The hole mobilities (μhs) of the copolymers were obtained from the transfer characteristics of the devices in the saturation regime (Table 2). The μhs of PTh4FBSe, P1 and P2 were 0.12, 0.46, and 0.32 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. It was found that the μhs of the copolymers have better correlation with the π-stacking order than the lamellar order. P1, which has the highest π-stacking order and the shortest dπ–π, but the lowest lamellar order, delivered the highest μh (0.46 cm2 V−1 s−1) among the copolymers. Remarkably, the μh of the random copolymer P1 is higher than the μhs of regular alternating copolymers, PTh4FBSe (0.12 cm2 V−1 s−1) and PTh4FBT (0.29 cm2 V−1 s−1).46 The observation is not trivial, because it has been known that the lack of backbone regularity degraded the solid-state order and therefore the charge mobility of the conjugated polymers.51P1 provides an important example showing that although the lack of backbone regularity degrades the lamellar order, the adjustment of the FBSe:FBT ratio enables the optimization of the π-stacking order and the μhs of the copolymers.

BHJ PSC characteristics
To evaluate the photovoltaic performances of the copolymers, BHJ PSCs with an inverted architecture – ITO/ZnO/copolymer:PC71BM (1:2 w/w)/MoO3/Ag were fabricated. The current density–voltage characteristics of the devices under a simulated AM 1.5 G illumination of 100 mW cm−2 are shown in Fig. 4 and summarized in Table 3. Without optimization, Voc and Jsc were 0.68 V, and 11.9 mA cm−2, respectively, for the PTh4FBSe PSCs; 0.68 V, and 11.4 mA cm−2 for the P1 PSCs, respectively; and 0.72 V and 10.5 mA cm−2 for the P2 PSCs, respectively. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements of the PSCs are shown in Fig. 5. Without DIO additive, PTh4FBSe:PC71BM PSCs delivered an EQE value which exceeds 40% over the wavelength range from 380 nm to 740 nm, but the EQE values of the P1:PC71BM and P2:PC71BM PSCs are lower in the same range. The results explain the highest Jsc of 11.9 mA cm−2 delivered by the PTh4FBSe:PC71BM PSCs. Although the EQE values of the P1:PC71BM and P2:PC71BM PSCs are similar in the wavelength range from 300 nm to 700 nm, the onset of the P2:PC71BM device is at 761 nm, but that of the P1:PC71BM device is at 790 nm. The extra photons in the longer wavelength region harvested by P1 contributed to the higher Jsc of the P1:PC71BM device. Thus, the higher FBSe content in PTh4FBSe and P1 led to the narrower Egs of the copolymers and the higher Jscs of the devices. In contrast, the higher FBT content in P2 resulted in a lower-lying EHOMO and a higher Voc.

However, when compared to the Jsc of PTh4FBT:PC71BM PSCs (13.5 mA cm−2),46 the narrower Eg of PTh4FBSe did not promote a higher Jsc. To identify the origins of the low Jsc, the morphology of the active layers was investigated using HR-TEM. As shown in Fig. 6a, c and e, the copolymer:PC71BM thin-films are very homogeneous, regardless of the FBSe:FBT ratios of the copolymers. The images suggested that the copolymers have good miscibility in PC71BM. These overly homogeneous blends may cause insufficient phase separation and fragmented charge transporting channels. Hence, DIO was used as a process additive to promote the phase segregation.52,53 With 3 vol% of DIO, the enhanced contrast in the PTh4FBSe:PC71BM thin film (Fig. 6b) indicates a more obvious separation between PTh4FBSe and PC71BM. The interpenetrating PTh4FBSe-rich, and PC71BM-rich domains became relatively larger and were beneficial for charge transport. The hole mobilities of the PTh4FBSe:PC71BM blend films under a space charge limited current (SCLC) model increased from 6.73 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the devices prepared without DIO to 3.38 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 for those prepared with DIO, indicating that the enhanced phase separation improved the charge mobility. Furthermore, the EQE values of the PTh4FBSe:PC71BM PSCs increased from 40% (Fig. 5a, without DIO) to over 50% (Fig. 5a, with DIO) in the wavelength range from 380 nm to 770 nm. Thus, because of the morphological change, the Jsc of the PTh4FBSe:PC71BM PSCs (Fig. 5a) increased correspondingly from 11.9 to 15.3 mA cm−2 to give a PCE of 6.06%. However, DIO did not cause significant morphological changes in the P1:PC71BM and P2:PC71BM active layers as shown in the TEM images (Fig. 6d, f). It is possible that the random ternary copolymers have better miscibility in PC71BM, so that the DIO additive has less effect on the degree of phase separation. The Jscs of the P1:PC71BM and P2:PC71BM PSCs increased slightly to 12.0 mA cm−2 and 12.6 mA cm−2, respectively, to deliver PCEs up to 5.20% and 5.63% (Table 3).

Conclusions
In this study a series of D–A copolymers containing different FBSe:FBT ratios were synthesized. The influences of the FBSe:FBT ratio on the polymer properties, solid-state morphology and device performances were investigated. It was found that the copolymers with higher FBSe content have narrower Eg, higher lying EHOMO, and delivered higher Jsc, but lower Voc in the PSCs. DSC results indicated that P1, which has the most irregular FBSe:FBT sequence along the backbone showed the lowest Tm. XRD results showed that the solid-state packing of the copolymers is affected by the chain sequence, steric effect of the chalcogen atoms (Se vs. S) and the intermolecular interaction strength. However, it is interesting to find that the irregularity in the chain sequence degrades the lamellar order, but not the π-stacking order. The random ternary copolymers, P1 and P2, possess more ordered π-stacking than the alternating copolymers, PTh4FBSe and PTh4FBT. The most irregular P1 even has the smallest dπ–π among all the FBSe:FBT copolymers. Thus, P1 delivered the highest OFET μh of 0.46 cm2 V−1 s−1 because of its ordered π-stacking and small dπ–π. In the polymer:PC71BM blend films, the FBSe containing copolymers have good miscibility in PC71BM. The degree of phase separation of PTh4FBSe:PC71BM can be enhanced by DIO additive, but it is not effective for the random ternary copolymers. The highest PCE of 6.06 % with Voc of 0.64 V, Jsc of 15.3 mA cm−2, and FF of 61.8% was delivered by the PTh4FBSe:PC71BM PSCs. Because the FBSe and FBT units are very similar in their structures, the influences of the acceptor ratios and the backbone randomness were better identified in this study.
