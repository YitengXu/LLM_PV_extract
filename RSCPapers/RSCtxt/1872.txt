    , Accepted 7th October 2013First published on 28th October 2013AbstractWe present the fabrication and characterization of Ti-doped hematite (α-Fe2O3) films for application as photoanodes in photoelectrochemical (PEC) cells for water splitting. It is demonstrated that Ti doping significantly improves the PEC activity as the photocurrent at 1.0 V vs. Ag/AgCl electrode for a 400 nm thick Ti-doped film (0.66 mA cm−2) was found to be ∼14 times higher than that of an undoped film (0.045 mA cm−2). The films were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy to obtain information about their structural, electronic, and charge carrier dynamic properties. Based on characterization of the chemical states of the involved elements as well as the charge carrier dynamics of the films with Ti doping, it appears that the photocurrent enhancement is related to an increase in charge carrier density or reduced electron–hole recombination. The highest incident photon conversion efficiency (IPCE) measured for this system was 27.0% at 360 nm at a potential of 1.23 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), which was obtained on a 400 nm thick Ti-doped α-Fe2O3 film.
Introduction
Metal oxides have attracted a great deal of attention as photoelectrodes for photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting since the work of Fujishima and Honda in 1972.1 An extensive amount of research has been conducted with the aim of improving the water splitting capabilities of metal oxides as the primary photoelectrode.2–6 Specifically, the use of hematite (α-Fe2O3) has gained significant traction due to its favorable band position, inertness, low toxicity, low cost, and natural abundance, despite the drawbacks of its poor minority charge carrier mobility and fast electron–hole recombination.7–12 This recombination competes directly with electrochemical surface reactions. As such, there is a strong motivation in current research to reduce the electron–hole recombination in this material by improving its electronic transport properties. Under reaction conditions, electron transport occurs in this material via the small polaron hopping mechanism.13 Impurities may improve conduction by introducing charge compensation with parent ions.13−16 Thus, it is now common to introduce metal ion impurities into α-Fe2O3, such as Ti4+,17–20 Sn4+,21,22 Pt4+,23,24 Ta5+,25 and W6+,26 to reduce the electron–hole recombination rate. Indeed, Ti-doped α-Fe2O3 photoanodes prepared by a deposition-annealing process showed greatly improved photocurrent and incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) at lower bias voltages, which was attributed to improved donor density and a reduced electron–hole recombination rate at a time scale beyond a few picoseconds.18 Similarly, Si incorporation has been reported to effectively enhance the photocurrent density of α-Fe2O3 as photoanodes which, in addition to the properties listed above, was found to favorably influence the grain size.27,28
Reducing sample feature dimensions to the nanoscale to match the short minority carrier diffusion length in α-Fe2O3 has been an effective alternative in improving PEC performance.18,29 For example, a water splitting photocurrent of over 3 mA cm−2 at an applied potential of +1.23 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) under AM 1.5G 100 mW cm−2 simulated sunlight condition was achieved with a cauliflower-type α-Fe2O3 nanostructure with an IrO2 catalyst.30 One-dimensional α-Fe2O3 nanostructures (e.g., nanorods) have also been designed to reduce the transport distance required for charge carriers to reach the semiconductor/electrolyte interface.31−33 Notable recent advances suggest that the parallel optimization of both nanostructure and electronic properties via metal element doping can bring us closer to the realization of the full potential of solar water splitting using α-Fe2O3 as the basis for photoanodes.26,34,35
Motivated by these advances, this study examined the influence of Ti impurities on the physical properties and PEC activity of hematite photoelectrodes for water oxidation. Ti was incorporated into α-Fe2O3 photoanodes using TiCl3 as a precursor in solution phase growth which provided a viable method for low-cost and large-scale fabrication of doped photoanodes for solar water splitting as well as other applications, such as gas sensing.
Experimental section
Film synthesis and preparation
Ti-doped α-Fe2O3 photoanodes were grown on FTO (fluorine-doped tin oxide, Pilkington, TEC7) glass by a previously reported aqueous chemical growth method36 followed by a high temperature annealing activation process.37 The experiment was performed with analytical grade chemicals in an aqueous solution containing 0.15 M ferric chloride (FeCl3·6H2O, Sigma-Aldrich), 1 M sodium nitrate (NaNO3, Sigma-Aldrich), and desired amounts of 20 wt% titanium trichloride (TiCl3, Acros), with pH value set at ∼1.4 by dropwise addition of 37% HCl (Sigma-Aldrich). 20 mL of the above solution was placed in a cap-sealed glass vial containing two back-to-back slips of FTO glass leaning against the inner wall. After heating in a regular oven at 100 °C for 24 h, the resultant yellow films were washed with distilled water and dried, then annealed at 750 °C for 5 min with a ramping rate of 25 °C min−1. Desired amounts of 20 wt% TiCl3 aqueous solution (0, 2, 5, 10, 20, and 35 μL) were added to the growth solution to create a series of Ti-doped α-Fe2O3 photoanodes, denoted xTiFe, where x represents the added volume of TiCl3.
Characterization
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were obtained with a Hitachi environmental field emission scanning electron microscope (Model S-4300SE/N) operating in secondary electron detection mode. Raman scattering was performed on a Jobin Yvon LabRAM HR spectrometer using 514.5 nm irradiation from an Ar+ laser with power set to 20 mW. X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were performed on a Siemens D5000 diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation. Spectral transmittance and absorptance measurements were obtained with a commercial thin film metrology system (Scientific Computing International, FilmTek Par 3000 SE). The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were conducted on a Kratos spectrometer (AXIS Ultra DLD) with monochromatic Al Kα radiation (hν = 1486.69 eV) with a concentric hemispherical analyzer.
The ultrafast transient absorption studies were carried out on a Quantronix-designed femtosecond laser system consisting of an Er-doped fiber oscillator, a regenerative amplifier, and a diode-pumped, Q-switched, second-harmonic Nd:YLF pump laser (527 nm, 750 Hz, 10 W). After amplification, the as-generated fundamental beam (∼800 nm, 750 Hz repetition rate) was beam-split in order to generate both a white light continuum probe pulse and a tunable pump from an optical parametric amplifier. For these measurements, the pump output was tuned to 500 nm with a pulse duration of ∼180 fs. The pump and probe were overlapped spatially and temporally at the sample. The spectra were recorded after excitation with the 500 nm pump and interrogation by a probe spanning the visible range of wavelengths (450–800 nm) over a temporal delay between the pump and probe pulses. This delay was varied by a motor-controlled translation stage from 0–1000 ps with 1 μm (3 fs) resolution. The difference absorption of each sample was measured over the aforementioned delay interval four times and the data were averaged to achieve lower overall noise.38
PEC characterization
PEC measurements were conducted using a potentiostat (Pine Instruments Bipotentiostat) in 0.5 M NaCl (pH 6.7) aqueous solution using a three-electrode configuration with the Ti-doped α-Fe2O3 photoanode as the working electrode, Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode, and Pt as the counter electrode. N2 gas was continuously bubbled in solution before and during the experiment to remove any dissolved O2 and therefore suppress the reduction of O2 at the counter electrode. A 1 cm2 masked-off, sealed area of the Ti-doped α-Fe2O3 sample was irradiated with a 300 W Xe lamp solar simulator with adjustable power settings through an AM 1.5G filter (Oriel). The light intensity at the sample location in the PEC cell was 100 mW cm−2 as measured by a power detector (Newport).
IPCE measurements were performed using a 300 W Xe lamp integrated with a computer-controlled monochromator (Beijing Optic Instrument Factory), a photochopper (PARC), and a lock-in amplifier (Signal Recovery) used for photocurrent detection. The absolute intensity of the incident light from the monochromator was measured with a radiometer/photometer (International Light). All IPCE measurements were carried out under potential-controlled conditions, with 0.65 V as applied potential vs. Ag/AgCl reference electrode (i.e., 1.23 V vs. RHE, calculated from the Nernst equation: ERHE = EAg/AgCl + E°Ag/AgCl + 0.057 pH). Mott–Schottky measurements were performed in the dark with 1 kHz frequency in a 0.1 M NaOH electrolyte solution with the same three-electrode configuration.
Results and discussion
Morphology
It has been demonstrated that high temperature annealing (greater than 700 °C) is necessary to facilitate reasonable PEC efficiencies for α-Fe2O3 photoanodes grown from solution.22,37–40 This is supported by our previous studies, which showed that both undoped and doped α-Fe2O3 nanorod arrays showed low PEC performance when annealed near 450 °C.26,34 For this reason, a high temperature annealing process at 750 °C for 5 min was used in this study to activate both undoped and Ti-doped α-Fe2O3 samples for PEC water splitting.

Fig. 1 compares the morphology of undoped and Ti-doped α-Fe2O3 thin films on FTO substrates after annealing to 750 °C. The undoped α-Fe2O3 film (Fig. 1A) possesses a morphology characteristic to that previously observed in the literature.37 Also noticeable is that the nanostructure progressively alters as an increasing amount of TiCl3 is introduced into the growth solution. All Ti-doped α-Fe2O3 samples comprise irregular clusters and possess a similar morphology, shown in Fig. 1B–F. It is noted that the distinct morphology of the doped hematite samples originates from the inclusion of TiCl3 in the precursor solution utilized for Ti incorporation. As described by the Gibbs adsorption isotherm,41 any adsorption phenomenon at the water–oxide interface will decrease the surface tension for the nanocrystal nucleation and growth in aqueous solution. Thus, it is reasonable that the morphology, size, and orientation of the resultant hematite nanostructures depend on growth conditions that are expected to change upon addition of Ti precursors in the aqueous solution.42 Moreover, the addition of TiCl3 in precursor solution also influences the thickness of the resultant α-Fe2O3 films, as shown in Fig. 2. When the amount of TiCl3 aqueous solution is increased from 0 to 20 μL, the thickness decreases from ∼600 nm for the undoped sample (Fig. 2A) to ∼200 nm for the 20TiFe sample (Fig. 2E). A further increase in the amount of TiCl3 in the aqueous solution produces films with irregular clusters randomly deposited onto the FTO substrate, with the FTO surface partially exposed, as seen in the 35TiFe sample (Fig. 1F and 2F).

Crystal structure
The crystal structures of the samples were analyzed by XRD, as shown in Fig. S1 in the ESI.† Excluding peaks associated with the substrate, only peaks that can be assigned to α-Fe2O3 are observed, suggesting that the Ti incorporation is not associated with any new long-range order in the crystals. By careful examination of the α-Fe2O3 peaks, we observed that the peak intensities associated with the (104), (110), and (300) planes decrease with an increasing quantity of TiCl3 in the precursor solution, indicating the gradual decrease in the film thickness upon doping.
Raman spectroscopy was also used to examine the phase of the films, as shown in Fig. S2 in the ESI.† Due to the reduced thickness of the films grown from a higher Ti concentration, peaks at ∼780 and ∼1100 cm−1 associated with the FTO substrate are present.43 Additionally, the peak located at ∼657 cm−1 was more intense for the Ti-doped α-Fe2O3 samples than for the undoped α-Fe2O3 sample. This peak can be assigned to a disorder phase induced by Ti4+ incorporation,44 rather than the presence of Fe3O4 or FeO, since no associated Fe2+ was observed by XPS (see below). A similar disorder phase was detected by Raman spectroscopy performed on doped α-Fe2O3 films in previous studies.23,26,34 This has been considered as supportive evidence for the assertion that doping with a foreign element alters the structure of α-Fe2O3.23
Ti dopant concentration and distribution
XPS measurements were performed to analyze the oxidation state of Fe in the films. The Fe 2p3/2 peaks for both undoped and Ti-doped α-Fe2O3 in Fig. 3A are located at a binding energy of ∼711.1 eV. This value is consistent with typical values observed for Fe3+ in α-Fe2O3,45 but is not expected for Fe2+.46 The satellite peak observed near 719.2 eV is most likely indicative of the presence of Fe3+ species.47 The absence of a satellite peak at 717.2 eV provides further evidence that no Fe2+ exists on the surface of the films. Therefore, based on this XPS measurement, we conclude that the Ti impurity does not significantly influence the chemical state of Fe in the films. This result has been found in previous studies on doped α-Fe2O3.18,23,48–51 Moreover, the absence of the Fe2+ species in doped α-Fe2O3 films has been unambiguously confirmed by X-ray absorption spectroscopy.19,52 In contrast, it has also been observed that the substitution of Fe3+ by M4+ ions (where M can be Si4+, Ti4+ or Sn4+) in the lattice of α-Fe2O3 increases the concentration of Fe2+ by a mechanism which promotes charge neutrality.37,53,54 In these studies, the presence of Fe2+ species was identified by an Fe 2p peak at ∼715 eV. The additional peak observed at ∼716.2 eV for the 35TiFe film in Fig. 3A could indicate the presence of Sn4+ (Sn 3p), which results from the exposed FTO substrate. The exposed FTO substrate can be further analyzed through examination of the Sn 3d peak (Fig. 3B). The intensity of the Sn 3d peak increases gradually as the film thickness decreases, which is consistent with the diffusion-induced Sn distribution previously observed. As shown in Fig. 3C, all Ti-doped α-Fe2O3 films show clear Ti 2p peaks at 458.4 eV (2p3/2) and 464.2 eV (2p1/2). These Ti 2p peaks are consistent with Ti in a fully oxidized Ti4+ state.55 Thus, it is expected that fully oxidized Ti4+ dopants exist in α-Fe2O3 after a high-temperature annealing process. Fig. 3D presents the O 1s spectra for undoped and Ti-doped samples. The binding energies of O 1s for undoped α-Fe2O3 (529.9 eV) and Ti-doped α-Fe2O3 (530.2 eV) are similar to those for α-Fe2O3 in the literature.18,19

The surface atomic compositions of the Ti-doped α-Fe2O3 films were determined by XPS analysis, and are shown in Fig. 3E as a function of the amount of TiCl3 added to the precursor solution. Interestingly, the curves suggest that the atomic concentration of Ti in all Ti-doped films was approximately 6% (the large Sn surface concentration for the 35TiFe sample originates from the exposed FTO substrate). Although the reason for the atomic concentration of Ti in all Ti-doped films being 6% is unknown, it could be dictated by the energetics of thermodynamic stabilization of the α-Fe2O3 crystals associated with incorporation of Ti during solution growth.
In order to investigate the distribution of Ti impurities and diffused Sn as a function of depth, a series of XPS measurements were conducted during controlled Ar+ etching for 860 s. Here, we consider the 20TiFe sample as an example. Upon Ar+ etching, the peak area of Ti 2p (Ti4+) decreases (Fig. S3A in the ESI†) whereas the peak area of Sn 3d (Sn4+) increases (Fig. S3B in the ESI†), indicating that the Ti atomic concentration slightly decreases and Sn concentration increases with depth into the film (Fig. 4A). However, the nearly unchanged molar ratio of Ti:Fe (Fig. 4B) indicates the homogeneous substitution of Ti4+ at Fe3+ sites. In this case, the graded distribution of diffused Sn can cause not only a decrease in the Ti atomic concentration but also a nearly constant Ti:Fe molar ratio throughout the depth of the film. A similar depth profile generated from Fe 2p spectra (Fig. S3C in the ESI†) shows Fe3+ to exist at or near the surface of the 20TiFe film both before and after Ar+ etching. Another peak located at approximately 716.5 eV (Sn4+, Sn 3p) increases in intensity with depth and is again related to a diffusion-induced Sn gradient throughout the film. Fig. S4 in the ESI† shows these observations schematically: Sn4+ has a graded distribution throughout the film whereas Ti4+ is distributed homogenously throughout and most likely substitutes for a portion of Fe3+.

Optical properties
Spectral transmittance and absorbance measurements were performed to characterize the optical properties of undoped and Ti-doped α-Fe2O3 samples. Fig. S5A and B in the ESI† shows that the spectral transmittance increases with an increasing volume of TiCl3 in the precursor solution, an observation which relates simply to the differing thicknesses among these films. According to the Kubelka–Munk equation for indirect-allowed semiconductors,56,57 the band gaps of both α-Fe2O3 and Ti-doped α-Fe2O3 samples were determined to be 2.1–2.2 eV, with results shown in Fig. S5C in the ESI,† calculated from the spectral transmittance and absorptance (Fig. S5A and B in the ESI†). In other words, Ti doping will not greatly change the band gap of α-Fe2O3, which is consistent with observations in previous studies.21
PEC and electrochemical properties
Due to the poor minority charge carrier mobility (0.2 cm2 V−1 s−1)13 which results in a small hole diffusion length (2–4 nm),58 very thin films are likely required in order to maximize the portion of photogenerated carriers reaching the oxide-liquid interface.59 Modifying the electrical properties of the α-Fe2O3 films by metal incorporation may present an opportunity to utilize thicker films, which absorb more light.

Fig. 5 shows a set of linear-sweep current–potential plots for the films acting as photoanodes with chopped AM 1.5G light of 100 mW cm−2 intensity. Here, an aqueous solution of NaCl was used as an electrolyte to decrease the O2 overpotential for PEC water splitting.60–62 This is because Cl− ions, competing with OH− ions, could be oxidized by photogenerated holes at the photoanode.63,64 Upon illumination, the undoped α-Fe2O3 film (0TiFe film) shows an observable photocurrent in the range of several μA cm−2 at 0.05 V which continues to increase to 0.045 mA cm−2 at 1.0 V. In comparison to the undoped α-Fe2O3 film, the Ti-doped α-Fe2O3 films show much higher photocurrents at 1.0 V (Fig. 5). The 5TiFe film reaches a photocurrent density of 0.66 mA cm−2 at 1.0 V, which is ∼14 times higher than that of the undoped α-Fe2O3 film (Fig. 5, inset). IPCE tests were performed to evaluate the spectral response for water photo-oxidation between 320 and 600 nm (at 1.23 V vs. RHE). As shown in Fig. 6, the 5TiFe film shows IPCE values much greater than that of the 0TiFe film. Overall these results indicate a positive effect of Ti incorporation on water oxidation photoactivity. This could be related to the altered electronic properties as well as the tuned film thickness upon Ti incorporation.

Mott–Schottky analysis was used to determine the charge carrier density of undoped α-Fe2O3 (0TiFe) and Ti-doped α-Fe2O3 (5TiFe) films, and the results are shown in Fig. 7. Charge carrier density can be calculated from the slope of Mott–Schottky plots using the equation: Nd = (2/e0εε0)[d(1/C2)/dV]−1, where e0 is the electron charge, ε the dielectric constant of α-Fe2O3 (ε = 80),65ε0 the permittivity of vacuum, Nd the donor density, and V the applied bias at the electrode. The positive slopes indicate that both undoped α-Fe2O3 and Ti-doped α-Fe2O3 (0TiFe and 5TiFe) samples are n-type semiconductors with electrons operating as the majority carriers. The electron density of the undoped α-Fe2O3 film was calculated to be 2.66 × 1019 cm−3. By comparison, Ti doping leads to an increase in electron density of 2 orders of magnitude for α-Fe2O3, with the value calculated to be 1.60 × 1021 cm−3 for the 5TiFe film. The remarkably increased charge carrier density, which is linearly proportional to conductivity according to the formula σ = ne0μ0, leads to lower impedance for Ti-doped samples. The enhanced electrical conductivity would lengthen the lifetime of charge carriers, resulting in a reduction in charge recombination.66 Thus, the increased donor density by Ti doping is believed to be mainly responsible for the pronounced enhancement in PEC performance.18,67 The enhanced electrical conductivity is also likely to reduce electron–hole recombination since charge transport competes with electron–hole recombination.

Charge carrier dynamics
Ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy was performed to study the charge carrier dynamics in the films in order to verify the possible effect of Ti-doping on the photoexcited electron lifetimes in α-Fe2O3 films.11 Transient difference absorption (dA) was recorded after photoexcitation with a 500 nm pump pulse and interrogation with a 450–800 nm white light probe pulse. The spectral evolution of the 0TiFe and 5TiFe films is shown in Fig. 8A and B, respectively. Overall, the charge carrier decay for both undoped and Ti-doped α-Fe2O3 films is very fast; a rapid loss of photoexcited electrons occurs within the first few ps for each of the films, indicating rapid electron–hole recombination. This recombination is most evident in the 0–10 ps windows of the topographical plots shown in Fig. 8C and D. Such an observation is common for hematite nanostructures and typically attributed to the high density of electronic states in the bandgap caused by both internal and surface defects68 as well as a high density of intrinsic electronic states.69 Thus, the early time dynamics of both films are dominated by intrinsic properties of α-Fe2O3. For both films, there is a blue shift in maximum transient dA signal from ∼593 nm to ∼582 nm over the 0–1 ns time delay, indicating that initial relaxation processes occur at lower energies than those of longer time scales. Furthermore, the transient absorption feature of the 5TiFe film appears broader than that of the 0TiFe film, prompting quantitative comparison of charge carrier decays.

Normalized, single wavelength decay profiles for the λmax of the transient absorption features are shown in Fig. 9 for both films. These kinetic traces were fit to a triple-exponential convolved with a Gaussian, representing the cross-correlation of the 500 nm pump and 593 nm probe pulses. Time constants of 0.43 ± 0.10, 5.9 ± 2.0, and >1000 ps and 0.33 ± 0.10, 6.0 ± 2.0, and >1000 ps were obtained for 0TiFe and 5TiFe, respectively. It should be noted that in each case, the longest time constant is not considered a true value as it exceeds the 1 ns time delay at which the data were collected. Single wavelength decay profiles were also examined at longer wavelengths, where the difference in dA between films appears most evident. Fig. 10 shows the decay profiles for the films at 660 nm. At this wavelength, the fitting procedure described above returned time constants of 0.22 ± 0.10, 3.7 ± 2.0, and >1000 ps and 0.17 ± 0.10, 3.2 ± 1.0, >1000 ps for 0TiFe and 5TiFe, respectively. Again, the longest time constant is not considered a true value. Although the 5TiFe film appears to have slightly higher dA at longer wavelengths, the extracted time constants are not different enough to warrant claims of any decrease in electron hole recombination upon doping on the ultrafast time scale.

The decay profiles are fit using a nonlinear least-squares fitting algorithm to a triple-exponential decay convolved with a Gaussian, representing the cross-correlation of the 500 nm pump and 593 nm probe pulses. The solid lines are fitted curves.

The decay profiles are fit using a nonlinear least-squares fitting algorithm to a triple-exponential decay convolved with a Gaussian, representing the cross-correlation of the 500 nm pump and 660 nm probe pulses. The solid lines are fitted curves. 
As is characteristic of α-Fe2O3, changes in morphology and composition had little effect on the dynamics at both short and long time scales and were not wavelength-dependent.11 Although the absorption decay profile for the Ti-doped sample may seem to be slightly higher than that of the undoped sample on the time scale above 6 ps (Fig. 9, inset), we cannot say with certainty that the difference is significant. There is no noticeable difference in electron–hole recombination rates between the 0TiFe and 5TiFe films. Increased dA upon doping has been observed in a previous study on Ti-doped α-Fe2O3 films,18 and theoretically could contribute to the enhanced PEC performances of the Ti-doped α-Fe2O3 films since the photoactivity may be sensitive to the carrier lifetimes. However, we did not observe increased dA with decreased electron–hole recombination upon Ti doping on the time scale studied. Significant changes in lifetime may occur on much longer time scales (microseconds to milliseconds) with Ti doping and warrant future investigation.
It can be observed in Fig. 5 that the photocurrents (at a potential of 1.0 V vs. Ag/AgCl) of Ti-doped α-Fe2O3 films increase first and reach a maximum value of 0.66 mA cm−2 for 5TiFe, and then decrease to the lowest value obtained for 35TiFe. As analyzed by XPS measurements, the Ti surface concentration in all Ti-doped α-Fe2O3 films remained almost unchanged. Thus, the decreased thickness of these Ti-doped α-Fe2O3 films (xTiFe, x from 2 to 35) should account for their various PEC activities. As mentioned above, the film thickness should be optimized to facilitate carrier transport to interfaces as well as maximize light absorption. For thicker α-Fe2O3 films, large numbers of photons can be absorbed, but these films are likely subject to high recombination rates. For thinner α-Fe2O3 films, larger portions of photogenerated carriers reach interfaces, but only small numbers of photons are absorbed. In our experiments, the optimized combination of carrier transport and light absorption behaviour is reflected in the 5TiFe sample.
Conclusions
We have presented the fabrication and characterization of Ti-doped α-Fe2O3 films for application as photoanodes in PEC cells for water splitting. The measurements indicate that Ti doping significantly improves PEC activity. Interestingly, the improvements do not correlate directly with the surface concentration of Ti in the films. Instead, the film thickness was found to be a critical factor influencing activity, suggesting that an interplay between carrier transport and light absorption is important for this system. Based on characterization of the chemical states of the involved elements, it appears that activity enhancement by Ti incorporation is related to an increase in charge carrier density or reduced electron–hole recombination. Although the charge carrier dynamics elucidated by ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy did not show reduced electron–hole recombination upon Ti-doping on the 0–1000 ps timescale, this effect may be present on longer timescales and should be investigated in the future. The highest IPCE measured for this system was 27.0% at 360 nm at a potential of 1.23 vs. RHE, which was obtained on a Ti-incorporated α-Fe2O3 film with a thickness of ∼400 nm.
