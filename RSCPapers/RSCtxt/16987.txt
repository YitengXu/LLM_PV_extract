    , Accepted 11th November 2013First published on 11th November 2013AbstractA new system based on class II hybrid ionogels (Si-IL gels) has been developed for overcoming leaking problems associated with liquid electrolytes in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). We co-condensed a silica precursor with an alkoxysilane functionalized ionic liquid precursor, under acidic conditions, to obtain a hybrid ionogel where ionic liquid is covalently linked to silica domains. The morphology and the microstructure of the Si-IL xerogels were explored using NMR, SAXS and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM). Cyclic voltammetry experiments were carried out to measure the apparent diffusion coefficient of the redox couple I−/I3− into these Si-IL gels. The diffusion coefficient of triiodide in the gel is comparable to the one observed in a solvent-free based ionic liquid electrolyte. These Si-IL gels were evaluated as electrolytes in quasi-solid-state DSSCs. For this purpose, various DSSCs have been fabricated. The cells containing Si-IL ionogels with 50 wt% of a silica modified liquid ionic precursor exhibit a short-circuit photocurrent of 2.8 mA cm−2, an open circuit voltage of 680 mV, a fill factor of 0.65, and an overall efficiency of 1.25%. Accordingly, this work constitutes a proof of concept.
Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) made of a mesoporous network of interconnected TiO2 nanocrystals are an interesting alternative to conventional inorganic photovoltaic devices because of their high-efficiency and low-cost.1 Although an impressive 13% light-to-electricity conversion efficiency has been obtained for these photovoltaic devices with organic solvent-based electrolytes, the presence of a liquid electrolyte often causes sealing problems that impact the long term operation of the devices and raises safety issues.2 Therefore, different strategies to solidify the electrolyte have been explored.3–5 However, DSSCs containing solid electrolytes exhibit poor performances with overall efficiencies lower than 1%. This is linked to the low ionic conductivity of the electrolytes and/or the poor electrode/electrolyte interface, which is due to the insufficient penetration of the solid electrolyte (and/or the fast charge recombination). Gel-type quasi-solid electrolytes, containing either a polymer or an inorganic nanomaterial as additives, have been synthesized to overcome these limitations. Devices made of gel electrolytes exhibit a better efficiency compared to all-solid state electrolytes. But, gel electrolytes often trap organic solvents, which may cause high-temperature instability and flammability.6
Recently, a novel class of material such as ionic liquid has been tested as an electrolyte for DSSCs, because of its chemical stability, non-volatility, non-flammability and wide electrochemical window.7 DSSCs with aprotic ionic liquid as the electrolyte and I−/I3− as the redox couple have been reported.8–14 Among the various existing ionic liquids, imidazolium salts have been extensively tested. However, pure imidazolium iodide/triiodide (I−/I3−) exhibits high viscosity, which often yields DSSCs with poor performance. High concentration of I3− is then required to compensate for the slow diffusion of I3−.15,16 But, increasing I3− concentration has some drawbacks like a high absorption of UV light, which reduces the quantity of light available to excite electrons in the dye.17 The use of a binary ionic liquid electrolyte allows us to decrease the viscosity and DSSCs with an efficiency close to 3% were achieved.18,19 For example, various types of anions including tetracyanoborate (B(CN)4), tricyanomethanide (TCM), dicyanamide (DCA), thiocyanate (SCN) have been added to the ethylmethylimidazolium-based ILs. However, their use in DSSCs may be limited because of their high cost, toxicity and purity issues. Therefore, better alternatives are necessary for practical applications. Recently, eutectic ternary mixtures of iodide ILs as electrolytes, combined with nano-crystalline TiO2 particles as photo-electrodes, have led to DSSCs with an efficiency close to 8% under AM 1.5 illumination.20 However, the long-term stabilities of such DSSCs have not been reported.21
Ionogels such as ionic liquid (IL) trapped within a silica based matrix may offer an interesting alternative to overcome leaking and/or volatilization of the ILs.22,23 They also provide a physical barrier between the electrodes, thereby preventing short circuits.23–25 Ionogels are composed of both ionic liquids, which are non-flammable compounds, and a gel scaffold that constrains the liquid in a solid form. As a result, ionogel-based electrolytes are expected to be safer, and more amenable to flexible device design.
Ionogels can be synthesized using a variety of structural supports including, polymers, colloidal particles, carbon nanotubes and small organic gelators.26 But, few articles described the use of IL-based electrolytes including a silica scaffold or nanoparticles for enhancing the performance of DSSCs. Silica nanoparticles have been used as a gelator in IL electrolytes. DSSCs including these ionogels as electrolytes and ruthenium polypyridyl as a photosensitizer exhibit 7% efficiency under AM 1 sunlight.6
An alternative method to produce ionogels relies on the one-pot sol–gel synthesis of a silica scaffold to immobilize the IL in situ.28,29 This process exploits the reaction between tetraethoxysilane (TEOS), tetramethoxysilane (TMOS) and formic acid to generate the silica scaffold. The ionic liquids (ILs) are only trapped in the silica scaffold, but no covalent bonds are formed between silica and ILs (Class I hybrid30). Ionic liquid leaks may occur with time and, as a consequence, the ionic conductivity decreases. A modification of this strategy, where ILs are immobilized within a silica network through covalent links, was proposed by Neouze et al.22,31–38 Pre-formed silica nanoparticles were assembled with functionalized ILs bearing silane groups. Powders made of silica nanoparticles linked to each other via imidazolium functions have then been fabricated through control of the chemistry. But, the electrochemical behaviour of these powders has been only sparingly studied. Moreover, it is expected that the processing of these powders might perturb their properties. Especially, as silica nanopowders are linked to each other via ILs, a process such as compaction can disrupt this organization, leading to poor electrochemical properties.
To address this point, we modified the Neouze et al. approach such that functionalized ionic liquids containing silane groups are co-condensed with a silica precursor under acidic conditions to obtain ionogels. In these ionogels containing mainly silica, ILs are immobilized through covalent bonds with silane groups (Fig. 1a and b). These ionogels are processed as films or monoliths. We have here studied diffusive mass transfer of I−/I3− in the ionogels using cyclo-voltammetry. Within these ionogels, it was possible to measure the apparent diffusion coefficient as a function of the 3-D architecture obtained through the control of the sol–gel chemistry. The ionogel exhibiting the highest diffusion coefficient was then evaluated as the electrolyte component of quasi-solid-state DSSCs (Fig. 1c), using organic dye. These Si-IL ionogels have not been reported to the best of our knowledge for DSSC applications. This work constitutes a proof of concept and is not an optimization of the cell performance. It is interesting because the synthesis of the ionogels occurs directly in the DSCCs and, as a consequence, a better control of the electrolyte/electrode interfaces may be achieved, enhancing the performances of the DSSCs. More precisely, the DSSCs are filled with the liquid electrolyte that becomes gel over time. Thus, the electrode/electrolyte interfaces will be enhanced and then the reaction with the hole and the iodide will be facilitated, avoiding e−/h recombination. The presence of covalent bonds between silica and ILs may avoid leaks or volatilization of ILs and prevent electrolyte loss. These conditions are more favourable for long term performances.

Experimental
Chemicals
All starting materials were reagent grade and were used as purchased. Tetraethoxysilane (TEOS), methyltrimethoxysilane (MTMOS), ethanol, 3-iodopropyltrimethoxysilane, triethoxy-3-(2-imidazolin-1-yl)propylsilane were purchased from Aldrich.

The synthesis of 1,3-(3-propyltriethoxysilane,3-propyltrimethoxysilane)-4,5-dihydroimidazolium iodide was similar to the one that has been reported for 1-propyl-3-butylimidazolium iodide.31 In a typical experiment, 0.090 mol of (3-iodopropyl)trimethoxysilane was added to 0.090 mol of N-(3-propyltriethoxysilane)-4,5-dihydroimidazole. Then, the mixture was refluxed under nitrogen overnight. A viscous, transparent yellow-orange solution was recovered and characterized by NMR spectroscopy. The 1,3-(3-propyltriethoxy,3-propyltrimethoxysilane)-4,5-dihydroimidazolium iodide formed will be called Si-IL hereafter.
Synthesis of hybrid ionogels (Fig. 2b)
In a typical synthesis, TEOS was first pre-hydrolyzed under acidic conditions (3 mol of TEOS is mixed with 2 mol of HCl, 0.1 mol L−1 and 64 mol of H2O), in ethanol solution (10 mol) and left under stirring for 1 h at room temperature, and then for 2 h at 65 °C (this solution is called A). 4 moles of Si-IL were mixed with 1 mole of MTMOS in ethanol and the mixture was stirred for several minutes (this solution is called B). After its homogenization, solution B was added dropwise to a given amount of solution A (pre-hydrolyzed TEOS), under stirring. The various A:B mass ratios prepared are reported in Table 1. The mixture was then poured into a glass-flask and gelation took place after 1 h or several days, depending on the A:B mass ratio (see Table 1). Transparent, yellowish gels were formed.

Before gelation, the solutions containing silica precursors and ionic liquid were spin-coated onto Pt-silicon wafer to form transparent, yellowish hybrid films (see ESI,† Fig. S1).
Instrumentation
Nuclear magnetic resonance
Solution NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AVANCEIII 300 spectrometer (300.13 MHz for 1H, 75.47 MHz for 13C and 59.62 MHz for 29Si) with a 5 mm 1H/broadband probe head equipped with a z-gradient coil.

29Si MAS spectra of the Si-IL xerogels were obtained on a Bruker AVANCEIII 300 spectrometer (59.7 MHz for 29Si) using a 7 mm MAS Bruker probe. Experimental parameters: MAS frequency: 5 KHz, pulse angle: 30°, relaxation delay: 60 s, 1H high power decoupling during the acquisition of the 29Si signals, number of scans: 320. The isotropic chemical shifts are referenced towards TMS (0 ppm).
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) measurements
The film and the gel morphologies were observed by Field Emission Gun Scanning Electron Microscopy (FEG-SEM, Hitachi SU-70).
X-ray scattering
Small- and Wide-Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS/WAXS) measurements were performed using a Xenocs setup equipped with a Mo GENIX anode over a large q-range (0.3 to 30 nm−1). The Kα radiation (λ = 0.071 nm) was selected using a multilayered curved mirror focusing the beam toward infinity. The size of the beam at the sample position (0.8 × 0.8 mm2) was defined by two sets of scatterless FORVIS slits. The scattered beam was recorded using a large online scanner detector (345 mm in diameter from MAR Research) located at 735 mm from the sample. Quartz capillaries (3 mm in diameter with a wall thickness of 0.01 mm) from Hilgenberg were used as sample containers. FIT2D was used to perform the treatment of the data. The usual corrections for background (empty cell and detector noise) subtractions and intensity normalization were applied using a 2.36 mm thick low density polyethylene film from Goodfellow as standard. The scattered intensities are expressed as a function of q, the scattering vector, with q = (4π/λ)sin(θ/2), where λ is the wavelength of the incident beam, and θ the scattering angle. The standard silver behenate was used for the q-range calibration. The experimental resolution is Δq/q = 0.05.
Cyclic voltammetry experiments
The electrochemical experiments were performed using a conventional three-electrode cell. Platinum wire was used as the auxiliary electrode and a saturated calomel electrode as the reference electrode. The working electrode was the hybrid films deposited onto a Pt-silicon wafer or Pt-microelectrode (ME, homemade, r = 20 μm). Prior to any electrochemical measurements, the argon-saturated electrolyte (acetonitrile, HPLC grade, and LiClO4 at 0.5 mol L−1) was obtained by bubbling argon (15 min) in the solution. The potentiostat used was a Biologic SP-150. Cyclic voltammetry responses can be distorted because of ohmic drop; here, iR compensations were used.
Fabrication of dye-sensitized solar cells with Si-IL ionogels
A commercial test cell kit supplied by Solaronix was used. The TiO2 electrodes (4 μm thickness with no TiCl4 treatment) were heated for 30 min at 450 °C and soaked for 12 h in a solution of 3-(5-(4-(diphenylamino)styryl)thiophen-2-yl)-2-cyanoacrylic acid Dye (0.5 mM) and chenodeoxycholic acid (0.5 mM) in ethanol at room temperature. Then, the electrode was assembled with a platinized conducting glass electrode using a thermoplast hot-melt sealing foil (60 microns thick). The internal space was filled with an electrolyte, either the commonly available iodide/tri-iodide (Iodolyte AN-50, as it corresponds to a mixture of components, we reported here the CAS for each component: CAS: 75-05-8 for acetonitrile, CAS: 218151-78-1 for 1,2-dimethyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide and CAS: 7553-56-2 for iodine) or the Si-IL electrolyte containing 0.2 M I2, using a vacuum pump. Caps were also sealed to close the devices and perform the measurements under the same conditions. The current–voltage characteristics were measured with a Keithley 2635 system Source Meter. Solar cell performances were characterized at 100 mW cm−2 of AM 1.5 illumination with an Atlas Solar Constant 575PV simulator. Surface area: 0.36 cm2.
Results and discussion
Our approach to synthesize IL functionalized silica gels is based on hydrolysis and condensation reactions between alkoxysilane functionalized 4,5-dihydroimidazolium groups and other alkoxysilanes (TEOS, TMOS) in acidic conditions. This synthetic protocol is a modification of innovative methods reported by Neouze et al.31 for the synthesis of 3-D nanoarchitectures, formed with pre-formed silica nanoparticles linked to each other through ionic liquid like molecules.
The alkoxysilane functionalized IL was checked by 1H, 13C and 29Si (Fig. S2a and S2b, ESI†). The 1H NMR results are summarized in Fig. S2a (ESI†) with the respective proton chemical shifts assignments. From 1H NMR spectroscopy, it appears that the compound synthesized is mainly a mixture of several bis-N-(3-propyltrialkoxysilane) functionalized 4,5-dihydroimidazolium iodides. The mixture is due to the use of two different alkoxy groups (i.e. methoxy and ethoxy) in the starting reagents, which are redistributed on both trialkoxylsilyl moieties of the functionalized IL. 1H NMR also reveals the presence of a small amount (less than 10%) of one of the starting reagents, i.e. N-(3-propyltriethoxysilane)-4,5-dihydroimidazole. Even if the alkoxysilane functionalized IL contains a small amount of N-(3-propyltriethoxysilane)-4,5-dihydroimidazole, this should not perturb the formation of the ionogel, as this component also has a functionalized silane group.
An important factor that contributes to the diffusion of I3−/I− is the compliance of the network, which depends on the degree of condensation of the silica network and the flexibility of the bridging group, i.e. the imidazolium group.32 We therefore used 29Si solid state NMR to study the degree of condensation of silicon in Si-IL based xerogels containing various A:B ratios. We evaluated the relative proportion of the different Qn (Qn represents the substructure containing the n Si–O–Si bond) and Tn (Tn represents the functionalized silicon Tn sites with n Si–O–Si units) units. 29Si solid state NMR spectroscopy experiments are reported in Fig. 3a and b, where two regions have to be distinguished. The first one, located between −90 and −120 ppm, corresponds to Qn units and the second one, between −40 and −80 ppm, to Tn units. Table 2 summarizes the proportions of T and Q units obtained by 29Si MAS spectra for the xerogel Si-IL3 (A:B = 50:50) and Si-IL5 (A:B = 70:30). The experimental relative proportion of T and Q are comparable to the one observed for theoretical ones (cf.Table 1). The degree of condensation of the silica network was estimated from these data. Values of 74.7% and 81.7% have been obtained for Si-IL3 and Si-IL5, respectively. These results show that when more TEOS is introduced, the overall condensation of the silica network is more important. This increase in the degree of condensation mainly comes from a better condensation of the T species, the degree of condensation of which goes from 66.1 to 76.4, while the one of Q species drops from 95.7 to 88.3, when the composition (A:B) changes from 50:50 to 70:30.

The ionic liquid subunits influence the nanostructure of the ionogels as observed by Small and Wide Angle X-ray scattering (SAXS/WAXS) performed on ionogels with various B wt% (Fig. 4).
 Fig. 4  SAXS/WAXS measurements of the Si-IL gels obtained for various weight content of B (quantity varies between 20 and 75 wt%). 
All the xerogels exhibit a broad peak at q ∼ 16.5 nm−1 that is characteristic of the silica tetrahedrons within the amorphous silica network. For xerogels containing more than 60% in weight of solution B, a peak is also observed at q = 4.4 nm−1. This distance is related to the length of the ionic liquid subunits, and is very close to the lengths found in ionic silica nanoparticle networks including the ligand with one imidazolium chloride unit33 as well as in the bulk liquid-like IL taking into account the less interdigitation of the alkyl chains in the gel leading to slightly higher correlation lengths. A shoulder is also observed at ca. 9 nm−1. It corresponds to a characteristic length of 0.7 nm, close to the one reported in the literature for π stacking interactions.35–37 Accordingly, this distance was attributed to π–π interactions in between the ionic liquid backbones. Additionally, the curves profile at low q is highly dependent on the quantity of B (i.e. Si-IL precursor) in the ionogels. For ionogels with more than 60% B, the flat profile at low q indicates that no aggregate and no domain, up to a size of 100 nm, is present in the xerogels.38 The system appears homogeneous at this scale, as confirmed by FE-SEM micrographs, which show no features (Fig. S3, ESI†). Conversely, the intensity increases toward low q values for xerogels containing less Si-IL precursor (solution B). This would correspond to the existence of small cross-linked domains in the 20 nm range. The broad peak between 0.8 and 0.9 nm−1 indicates a correlation length of ∼8 nm by fitting with a broad-peak model (Fig. S4, ESI†) for ionogels containing up to 25 wt% of B. Xerogels with 30 and 40 wt% of B exhibit an upturn at low q. A correlation length of about 1 nm was obtained by fitting with a Debye–Anderson–Brumberger model or a sphere model with a Schulz distribution (Fig. S5, ESI†). The results observed in this work clearly show that the presence of a functionalized ionic liquid dramatically influence the nanostructure of the resulting ionogels.
As in the dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) the electrolyte is a gel, we examined the impact of the nanoarchitecture of the Si-IL gel on the electrochemical response (cyclic voltammograms, CVs), behaviour and diffusion coefficients of I− and I3− (Fig. 5 and 6). The CVs behaviour shown in Fig. 5 clearly illustrates the impact of the 3-D nanoarchitecture of the gel on the electrochemical responses at the surface of the Pt-microelectrode (Pt-ME).
 Fig. 5  CVs obtained using a Pt-disk microelectrode in Si-IL based gels at 20 mV s−1 for Si-IL gels 1 (solution A: 20), Si-IL gels 3 (solution A: 50) and Si-IL gels 4 (solution A: 75). 
 Fig. 6  CVs obtained using a Pt-disk microelectrode in Si-IL 3 based gels at 100, 50, 25, 20, 10, 5 mV s−1. 
It does also highlight the importance of determining the effect of scan rate on CVs obtained in Si-IL gels. Qualitatively, when solution B (solution containing the ionic liquid and iodide) is prevailing, the measured current is important. Clearly, the ratio A:B is the key parameter in the efficiency of charge transfer.
Typical cyclic voltammograms obtained in Si-IL3 (A:B = 50:50) based gels in LiClO4/ACN are reported in Fig. 6 at various scan rates from 5 mV s−1 to 100 mV s−1.
For a high scan rate, the CV obtained exhibits peak-shaped (transient) responses for I− and I3− oxidation and reduction, indicating that semi-infinite linear diffusion dominated at the Pt-ME surface. These responses are similar to those obtained in ionic liquid at both the micro-sized and nano-sized electrodes.14 Conversely, quasi steady-state responses were obtained at a scan rate of below 20 mV s−1. This result is confirmed through the variation of the logarithm of the peak currents, Ip, versus the log of the scan rate for I− and I3− oxidation for different Si-IL gels. We noted that logIp as a function of log υ varies linearly for scan rates above 20 mV s−1.
The apparent diffusion coefficient (Dapp) of triiodide can be calculated from the transient current using the Randles–Sevcik equation; the calculated diffusion coefficients of triiodide in the Si-IL ionogels were found to vary from 2.2 × 10−7 to 2.7 × 10−8 cm2 s−1 as a function of the A:B ratio (Table 3). But, we noted that the diffusion coefficient of triiodide in the ionogel is comparable to the one observed in the solvent-free-based ionic liquid electrolyte (results not shown here, and ref. 27,34).

We can also fabricate Si-IL as films, by spin coating at room temperature and under dry conditions the solution containing the silica precursor and the modified ionic liquid. The Si-IL films on Pt are transparent, homogeneous and dense (see ESI,† Fig. S1). The film thickness was evaluated to be 100 nm from FE-SEM experiments. Cyclic voltammetry experiments were used to describe the diffusion regime into the Si-ILs hybrid films. Fig. S6 (ESI†) shows cyclic voltammograms (CVs) of Si-IL hybrid films, obtained at 25 °C with LiClO4 in acetonitrile, for scan rates ranging from 20 mV s−1 to 100 mV s−1. The CV experiments exhibit two well-defined oxidation peaks at formal potential of 0.65 V and 0.37 V vs. Ag/AgCl, respectively. The first peak is assigned to the oxidation of I− to I3−, while the second one is attributed to the formation of I2 according to ref. 14. CV experiments also reveal a peak shape characteristic of a current response governed by a finite linear diffusion regime in the thin layer (Gaussian-shaped), as confirmed by the linear relationship between the peak current and the square root of the scan rate (Fig. S6, ESI†). Additionally, the peak-to-peak separation, ΔEp, due to I− or I3− oxidation increases with the scan rate (Fig. S8, ESI†). This behavior has been also observed for thin layer responses39 and has been attributed to either sluggish heterogeneous electron transfer kinetics across the electrode–ionic liquid interface or the effect of the uncompensated solution resistance, Ru.41 In our studies, ohmic drop was corrected, thus, we attributed the variation in ΔEp to electron transfer kinetics at the Pt/Si-IL film interface.
Finally, we fabricated DSSCs with Si-IL ionogels electrolytes using an organic dye and determined the DSSC characteristics (OCV, Jsc and efficiency) for only Si-ILs (50:50). A characteristic photocurrent density–voltage curve for a device with a Si-IL3 electrolyte at irradiance of light intensity of AM1 is reported in Fig. 7. We noted that the short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc), open circuit photovoltage (VOC) and fill factor (ff) of a device under full sunlight are 2.8 mA cm−2, 680 mV and 0.65, respectively, yielding an overall conversion efficiency (η) of 1.25%. This result indicates that the quasi-solid ionic liquid electrolyte was successfully employed in DSSCs, since the thickness of the electrolyte is quite large (60 μm). To evaluate the effect of our electrolyte on the performance of the DSSC, we also prepared a reference cell using a commercially available I3−/I2 electrolyte. The performance of this cell (see the I/V curve reported in the ESI,† Fig. S9) under our conditions shows similar characteristics for the Voc and ff with 0.67 V and 0.65 respectively. However, the density of current at Jsc is much higher with 5.7 mA cm2 compared to the cell using the Si-IL3 electrolyte. Thus, the overall reference cell yield is 2.8%, which is lower than the 5.1% efficiencies obtained using this organic dye for an optimized cell.41 This is mainly due to the non-optimization of the cell with no TiCl4 treatment; only 4 μm thickness of TiO2 layer constitutes the electrode. The reduction in yield of the Si-IL cell due to a decrease in the Jsc current can be explained by the diminution of covering between the electrolyte and the TiO2 surface. Indeed, the viscosity of the Si-IL electrolyte is very different than the I3−/I2 electrolyte. Thus the filling of the mesoporous TiO2 structure with the Si-IL electrolyte is not as efficient as the optimized iodine electrolyte. Graetzel et al.40 have shown by ac impedance spectroscopy and steady state that the main limiting factors in a cell containing ionic liquid as the electrolyte are the higher recombination and lower injection of charge. But, at low temperatures, the diffusion resistance in the ionic liquid cells may be the main limiting factor. In our experiment, ionic liquids are immobilized in the electrolyte, thus the diffusion resistance is probably large and contributes to the poor performance of the cell.

Nevertheless, the first constructions display conversion efficiency. Now, those performances of the DSSC devices have to be improved through (i) the optimization of the thickness of the electrolyte, (ii) the improvement of the electrode/electrolyte interfaces and (iii) the composition of the electrolyte to improve the diffusion of I3−, as well. To improve the electrode/electrolyte interface, the condensation of the silica network should be optimized in order to facilitate the processing of the electrolyte in the full cell, and more specifically the penetration of electrolyte into the porous TiO2 network. The diffusion of I− may also be improved through a careful control of the microstructure of the electrolyte. For example, the formation of an ion channel in the electrolyte should facilitate the transport of I3−.
Conclusions
The combination of ionic liquid and silane groups allows the synthesis of ionogels that can be used as electrolytes for DSSCs. We measured 1.25% energy conversion efficiency under full sunlight, which is comparable to most of the IL-based electrolytes. These Si-IL gel based electrolytes possess several inherent advantages, such as cheap raw materials and simple preparation procedures. The Si-IL gel electrolytes are found to have a high diffusion coefficient of I3−, as shown from CV experiments. Moreover in this study, both the cell design and the composition of the electrolyte were not optimized; therefore there is still room for improvement in the cell performances. Future works are devoted to the influence of the length of the ionic liquid chains, the concentration of I2 and additives in the electrolyte on the electrochemical performances.
