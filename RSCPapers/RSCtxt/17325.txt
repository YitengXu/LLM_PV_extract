    , Accepted 20th October 2022First published on 21st October 2022AbstractGreen hydrogen is an ideal and zero-pollution fuel that can be obtained using solar and other renewable energies. The efficient photocatalytic production of hydrogen mainly relies on the development of high-performance photocatalysts. In this work, we report the synthesis and photocatalytic hydrogen evolution application of a 2D coordination nanosheet (CONASH) constructed from bis-terpyridine ligands (Tpy) and Zn ions, which revealed an optical bandgap of 1.70 eV and exhibited excellent photocatalytic hydrogen-production performances of 3.10 mmol h−1 g−1 and 11.84 mmol g−1 h−1 under N2 and CO2 atmospheres, respectively. Such high photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rates are among the top tier in noble metal-free coordination complexes, providing a new way for designing hydrogen evolution photocatalysts based on highly structure- and band-adjustable 2D CONASHs.
Introduction
The increasing concerns about CO2 emissions and the scarcity of fossil fuels make the development of renewable and clean energy one of the most urgent tasks for our society.1 As a zero-pollution energy with high mass energy density, hydrogen has received fast-growing attention.2 Today, there are many methods available for H2 production, including the thermal decomposition of fossil fuels,3 electrolysis of water,4 decomposition of biomass,5 and the photocatalytic splitting of water.6 Although a large proportion of H2 is currently produced from fossil fuels through relatively mature techniques, it is still not possible to avoid CO2 and other pollutant emissions under the current technology framework.7 Also, water electrolysis faces the problems of huge energy consumption, low efficiency, and high cost for H2 production.8 Therefore, the solar-driven photocatalytic splitting of water is undoubtedly one of ideal routes for green H2 production.9,10 In this regard, it is crucial to design and develop efficient semiconducting photocatalysts.
Many semiconducting photocatalysts have been widely studied for water splitting hydrogen evolution to date, including TiO2,11 ZnO,12 SnO2,13 WO3,14 ZnS,15 ZnIn2S4,16 g-C3N4,17 CdS,18 and BiVO4.19 However, most of these suffer from a low photogenerated carrier mobility and utilization, resulting in an overall low photocatalytic activity. Among the various photocatalysts, metal–organic coordination materials are highly attractive with adjustable band gaps and tailored catalytic active sites due to the large number of available metal ions and a tremendous library of organic ligand blocks.20–22 Many coordination materials have been reported and shown excellent photocatalytic hydrogen-production properties. Since the first report of MOFs for photocatalytic hydrogen production,23 many MOFs have been formulated as photocatalysts with impressive performances, such as NH2-MIL-125(Ti),24 UiO-66,25 Co(II)@MIL-125-NH2,26 ZIF-8/g-C3N4,27 CdS/Ni-MOF,28 and 40-P-CdS/Ni-MOLs.29 In addition, many metal–organic coordination polymers with excellent photocatalytic hydrogen-production properties have also been reported. Wei et al. synthesized Co(II)-CP using Co(II) and amino-modified ligands that exhibited a high photocatalytic hydrogen-production activity of 1778 μmol g−1 h−1, which was attributed to the faster charge transfer and the suppression of the electron–hole recombination.30 Verma et al. integrated tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) and terpyridine (TPY) derivatives through amide linkages and obtained a TPY–TTF gelling agent for Zn–TPY–TTF synthesis, which had a high photocatalytic hydrogen-production activity of 530 μmol g−1 h−1.31 Through an in situ-generated triphenylamine-terpyridine (TPA-Tpy) and Zn(II)-assisted self-assembly, a donor–acceptor coordination polymer (TPA-Zn) was designed, demonstrating a broad-spectrum absorption and high hydrogen generation performance under visible-light irradiation (27.1 mmol g−1 over 9 h) with a good hydrogen generation performance relying on the intermittent disruption of conjugation by Zn(II) metal nodes to provide a suitable amount of exciton-separation ability and charge-carrier mobility.32 Although exhibiting great potential in photocatalytic H2 evolution, these materials still suffer from limited efficiency due to the bulky sizes and buried catalytic sites. Therefore, the design of low-dimensional structures for these metal–organic coordination materials should be a practical way to boost their photocatalytic activity, such as 2D CONASH.
2D CONASH is a new and intriguing type of 2D material constructed with alternating metal centres and organic ligands with a variety of special physical and chemical properties that have been explored for applications in electrochromism,33 electrocatalysis,34 photoelectric conversions,35 and photodetecting.36 In addition, 2D CONASH also exhibits excellent photocatalytic hydrogen-production performance due to its high-density and readily accessible catalytic sites, reduced reactant/product diffusion pathways, and fast electron transport. It was found that the Pt single-atom-decorated MOF nanosheets exhibited a H2-generation rate of 11320 μmol g−1 h−1, suggesting that the ultrathin 2D structure had advantages for the photocatalytic performances of metal–organic coordination materials.37 In addition, the photocatalytic H2-production activity of 2D CONASH could be significantly improved by introducing photosensitizers. For example, after the introduction of ((MBA)Ir(ppy)2)Cl or ((MBA)Ru(bpy)2)Cl2 into Ce-based CONASHs through post-synthetic modifications, the obtained Ce6-BTB-Ir or Ce6-BTB-Ru CONASHs showed 8.7–9.3-fold enhancement in photocatalytic H2-production activity.38 To date, the research on CONASH is still in its infancy, especially its applications in the field of photocatalytic H2 production. In addition, many photocatalysts contain heavy metals that are potentially harmful to the environment,39,40 or need noble metals, such as Au and Pt, as the cocatalysts when applied for photocatalytic H2 production.41,42 Therefore, it is of great interest to develop environmentally friendly and noble metal-free CONASH catalysts with high photocatalytic performances.
In this work, we report the bottom–up synthesis of a novel semiconducting Zn–Tpy CONASH from a two-armed nitrile-containing terpyridine ligand and Zn(II) via a liquid–liquid interface reaction. We introduced cyano groups into the Tpy ligands to facilitate the generation of 2D CONASH structures through a hydrogen bond-driven self-assembly. The chemical structure was well characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and fitted by theoretical simulations. Compared with the original Tpy ligand, the Zn–Tpy CONASH reduced the optical band gap to 1.70 eV and exhibited excellent H2-evolution activities of 3.10 mmol h−1 g−1 (under N2) and 11.84 mmol g−1 h−1 (under CO2) without using any noble metal components. Through theoretical simulations, the mechanism for the much enhanced photocatalytic activity was well revealed. This work should inspire future attempts towards novel 2D CONASH designs and bandgap engineering for broad optical and photocatalysis applications.
Experimental
Materials
4-Bromophenylacetonitrile, terephthalaldehyde, 4-formylphenylboronic acid, acetyl pyridine, potassium carbonate (K2CO3), and tetrakis(triphenylphosphine) palladium (0) (Pd(PPh3)4) were purchased from Dongguan and Aladdin Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd, respectively, and used without further purification. 1,4-Dioxane, aqueous ammonia 28%, and common solvents of analytical grade were supplied by AR Chemical Co. Ltd. CCK-8 was acquired from Biotime. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), fetal bovine serum (FBS), antibiotic and antimycotic solution, and Dulbecco's phosphate buffered saline (DPBS) were procured from Gibco.
Synthesis of Tpy
The Tpy ligand was synthesized by a three-step reaction process as shown in Scheme S1.† Compound 1 and Compound 2 were synthesized according to previous reports.43,44 Then, compound 1 (2 mmol) and compound 2 (1 mmol) in 1,4-dioxane/H2O (14 mL/2 mL) were added in to a two-neck flask. The mixture was purged with N2 three times. Subsequently, K2CO3 (8 mmol) and Pd(PPh3)4 (15 mol%) were added. The reaction mixture was stirred at 100 °C for 24 h. After cooling to room temperature the precipitate was filtered followed by washing with chloroform, DMF, and water, to give a green solid product in a 65% yield.
Synthesis of Zn–Tpy CONASH
Zn–Tpy CONASH was synthesized by a simple bottom–up liquid–liquid interface growth containing ZnSO4·H2O (10 mM) in water (top layer) and Tpy (0.1 mM) in dichloromethane (bottom layer) bilayers in 50 mL beakers under ambient conditions, respectively. The solutions were let standing for 3 days for nanosheet growth. The nanosheets were washed thoroughly with water and dichloromethane and then transferred to various substrates for testing.
Material characterizations
Optical micrographs of Zn–Tpy CONASH were taken using a Motic Moticam 2506 microscope. SEM and TEM images were obtained on a MIRA3 LMH system from TESCAN and JEOL JEM 2010 microscope, respectively. AFM studies were conducted under the tapping mode on a Veeco Digital Instruments multimode scanning probe microscope with a Nanoscope III controller. Small-angle XRD was performed on a BRUKER D8-ADVANCE instrument. XPS spectra were taken on a Thermo Scientific K-Alpha. 1H-NMR spectra were obtained on a Bruker AVANCE III 400 instrument (with TMS used as the internal standard in NMR). Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF) spectrometry was conducted on a AB SCIEX MALDI-TOF 5800 mass spectrometer. FT-IR tests were conducted on a Bruker Vertex 70 in the range of 4000–400 cm−1 with the samples prepared as KBr pellets. UV-Vis-NIR spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu-2600 spectrophotometer. The fluorescence spectra were measured using a FP-8500 fluorescence spectrophotometer (Jasco, Japan). Cell imaging was measured on a Motic AE31E-EF-INW microscope. The light source used in the photocatalytic experiments was a 300 W xenon lamp (HSX-F300), and GC2004 gas chromatography was used to test the gas content. Mott–Schottky analysis, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and the photocurrent response signals were measured on a CORRTEST CS2350H electrochemical workstation, and dynamic light scattering (DLS, Zetasizer Nano ZS) was used to test the size of the Zn–Tpy CONASH in aqueous solution.
Simulations
The periodic structure model of Zn–Tpy was optimized using the Forcite module and the Dreiding force-field in Materials Studio.45 The simulation parameters were set as: iteration steps, 500; atomic root-mean-square force, 0.005 kcal mol−1 Å−1; energy difference, 0.0001 kcal mol−1. The Coulomb energy and van der Waals forces were selected based on atoms. On the basis of the above optimized structure, the PXRD simulation based on the above optimized structure was carried out on Mercury.46 The electrostatic potential and deformation electron density maps of Tpy and Zn–Tpy were simulated using the Dmol3 module.47,48
Cell culture, imaging, and cytotoxicity assay
The 4T1 cells were cultured on 96-well plates in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, GibcoTM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, GibcoTM), and 1% antibiotic and antimycotic solution (GibcoTM) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. When the cells were completely attached, the Zn–Tpy suspension with different concentrations was added to the cell wells (10 μL per well). After culturing in an incubator for another 30 min, the culture medium in every well was removed and washed with Dulbecco's phosphate buffered saline (DPBS) three times. Subsequently, the 4T1 cells were imaged by fluorescence microscopy. To evaluate the photostability of the Zn–Tpy NPs in cells, the cells were continuously irradiated with a high-power light (λEx = 480 nm, P = 150 W) for a certain time interval and the change of the fluorescence intensity was analyzed. The cytotoxicity of Zn–Tpy was evaluated by CCK-8 assay. The 4T1 cells (90 μL) were sown on a 96-well plate in which the density was about 1 × 104 cells per well. The Zn–Tpy suspension with different concentrations were added to the cells for 10 μL per well, and the final concentrations of Zn–Tpy in the cells were 6.25, 12.5, 25, 50, and 100 μg mL−1, respectively. Non-treated cells were used as a control. After culturing the cells in the incubator for another 24 h, 10 μL CCK-8 reagent was introduced into the wells. The cells were incubated for another 1 h. The absorbance of each well was measured at 450 nm using a microplate reader (Thermo Scientific Multiskan FC).
Photocatalytic hydrogen-production experiments
The photocatalytic hydrogen-production experiments were carried out in a 10 mL glass cell. For the photocatalytic experiments, 2 mg catalyst was dispersed in 8 mL of water containing 2 mL of triethanolamine (TEOA) as a sacrificial reagent. The suspension was sonicated to prepare a homogeneous dispersion. The reaction mixture was then purged with N2 for 30 min to remove any traces of dissolved H2 gas. The reaction mixture was irradiated with a 300 W xenon lamp under magnetic stirring at 500 rpm min−1, and 250 μL of headspace gas was sampled every 0.5 h using a Microliter Syringes gas-tight syringe and injected into the gas chromatograph for detection. In addition, no hydrogen evolution was observed for the mixture of water and TEOA under light irradiation in the absence of a photocatalyst. In addition, we also exhausted the system with CO2 instead of N2 for 30 min to make the system saturated by CO2, and then used the same irradiation condition to perform the photocatalytic experiment for hydrogen production. Tpy and Zn–Tpy coated on FTO conductive glass were used as the working electrodes (the effective coating area of the sample was 1.0 cm2), while Pt, SCE, and 0.5 M Na2SO4 were used as the counter electrode, reference electrode, and electrolyte, respectively. Then the Mott–Schottky curve, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and photocurrent response signal of Tpy and Zn–Tpy were tested by the electrochemical workstation.
Results and discussion
Zn–Tpy CONASH (Fig. 1a) was synthesized by a simple interfacial bottom-up growth. A thin yellowish film was obtained in the liquid–liquid interface region as shown in Fig. 1b, which could be transferred to various substrates. Optical and SEM images confirmed the continuous and smooth sheet morphology of the grown Zn–Tpy CONASH with the lateral size exceeding 0.1 mm (Fig. 1c–e). From the TEM analysis, it could be seen that the CONASH was mainly amorphous (Fig. 1f). The AFM image of the obtained Zn–Tpy CONASH confirmed the thickness of the sheet was about 120 nm (Fig. 1g).

To determine the structure of Zn–Tpy CONASH, we performed small-angle XRD characterizations and theoretical simulations. The optimized structural model of Zn–Tpy CONASH linked by the Zn2(μ-O2SO2)2(Tpy)2 motif developed by Dreiding force-field simulations is shown in Fig. 2a with the unit cell parameters of a = 40.4605 Å, b = 14.0529 Å, c = 7.7215 Å, α = 87.3715°, β = 34.5113°, γ = 64.2364°. The simulated diffraction peaks of the structure model based on the Dreiding force-field were 5.40° (16.34 Å), 8.83° (9.99 Å), and 11.54° (7.66 Å), corresponding to the crystal plane indices of (100), (010), and (401), respectively, as shown in Fig. 2b. These values fitted the experimental small-angle XRD peaks well, which were 5.29° (16.69 Å), 9.06° (9.75 Å), and 12.06° (7.33 Å), respectively. The differences between the simulated and experimental d-spacings were within 0.4 Å, indicating the rationality of the simulated structure for the designed Zn–Tpy CONASH.

Comprehensive spectroscopic characterizations were also performed to verify the chemical structure of Zn–Tpy CONASH, including Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). It could be found from the FT-IR spectra that the nitrile group peaks of Zn–Tpy were obviously shifted towards lower wavenumbers compared with the pristine Tpy ligand. This was because of the formation of hydrogen bonds between the N atoms of the –CN groups and the H atoms of the neighbouring ligands in Zn–Tpy CONASH, leading to the reduced stretching vibration frequency of CN bonds.49 In addition, there were two distinct SO42− peaks (1114 cm−1 and 614 cm−1) formed in Zn–Tpy CONASH compared with Tpy, indicating the incorporation of SO42− in the final CONASH structure. To be specific, the characteristic vibration peak at 1114 cm−1 could be attributed to the ν3 mode of SO42−,50 while the additional peaks at 1195 and 1014 cm−1 were caused by the reduced symmetry of the SO42− structure from Td to C2v (Fig. 2c and S7b†).51
XPS was also employed to further demonstrate the coordination structure of Zn–Tpy CONASH. The results confirmed the existence of C, N, O, S, and Zn atoms, as shown in Fig. 2d. The measured atomic ratio of Zn:N:S was 1:4.19:0.96, which was close to the theoretical stoichiometry of the SO42− bridged coordination structure Zn2(μ-O2SO2)2(Tpy)2. The binding energies of N 1s were fitted with two peaks at 399.1 and 398.1 eV, which originated from the terpyridine and nitrile groups, respectively. In addition, while the S 2p peak of sulfate is usually at 169 eV,52 the S 2p core level spectrum of Zn–Tpy exhibited a low binding energy of 167.8 eV due to the formation of bridged structures.53 These results demonstrate the formation of Zn2(μ-O2SO2)2(Tpy)2 in the prepared Zn–Tpy CONASH.
The optical properties of the as-prepared CONASH were studied by UV-Vis-NIR and photoluminescence spectroscopies on quartz substrates. As shown in Fig. 3a, the Tpy has strong absorption in the UV and near UV ranges with the absorption onset at ≈550 nm. After coordination with Zn2+, the onset absorption in the Zn–Tpy spectrum was red-shifted to ≈800 nm. The optical band gaps of Tpy and Zn–Tpy were 2.58 and 1.70 eV based on the Kubelka–Munk function, respectively (Fig. 3b).54 This indicates that the coordination of Zn2+ with Tpy remarkably expanded the spectral absorptions and significantly reduced the band gap of CONASH. This phenomenon can be explained by the ligand-based intermolecular charge-transfer effect.53

The λEx for Tpy and Zn–Tpy were 450 and 410 nm, respectively. (d) Photostability measurements of solid CONASH and CONASH nanoparticles for bioimaging under the irradiation of λEx = 410 nm and recorded at a time interval of 10 s. The photostability of commercial Lyso-Tracker is also shown for comparison. 
The yellowish Zn–Tpy CONASH exhibited a strong orange-red photoluminescence under UV-light irradiation (Fig. 1c). Also, the PL emission spectrum of the CONASH structure (Fig. 3c) was red-shifted from 502 nm to 638 nm compared with the pristine ligand, which further indicated the successful formation of a coordination structure between the ligand and Zn2+. We further investigated the photostability of the CONASH, and the fluorescence intensity of the solid sheet remained about 100% after continuous irradiation by incident light (λEx = 410 nm) for 1 h, demonstrating the excellent resistance to photobleaching of Zn–Tpy CONASH (Fig. 3d). Such impressive photostability is critical when applied for optoelectronics, bioimaging, and other optically related applications. As expected, the Zn–Tpy CONASH nanoparticles prepared by the top-down exfoliation of CONASH film had an average particle size of about 4 nm, also exhibiting excellent photostability in live-cell imaging; and the bioimaging fluorescence intensity was maintained at 98% after 10 min and 94% after 20 min, in contrast with only ≈10% retention after 45 s irradiation for the commercially available Lyso-Tracker (Fig. 3d).
The photocatalytic H2-evolution performance of 2D CONASH was comprehensively explored. A 300 W xenon lamp was used as a light source and triethanolamine (TEOA) was added as the sacrificial reagent. Under saturation of N2, the evolution of H2 was 5.11 mmol g−1 in the initial 3 h under light irradiation (C1 = 1.70 mmol g−1 h−1, Fig. 4a), which increased up to 3.10 mmol g−1 h−1 in the 5th cycle (Fig. 4b). Such a H2-evolution activity was around 29 times higher than that of the pristine Tpy (0.107 mmol g−1 h−1). The DLS analysis of the CONASH samples before and after cyclic photocatalysis (Fig. S6†) revealed a much reduced average particle size of the photocatalysts from 1535 to 122 nm. The reduced sample size should provide a higher specific surface area and more catalytic sites, resulting in the observed gradual improvement of the photocatalytic activity of the Zn–Tpy in the cyclic test. Since the Zn–Tpy CONASH sample is a layered structure, the bulk layered structure may evolve gradually peeling off by the H2 bubbles during the process of photocatalysis, leading to the formation of thinner and smaller CONASH samples.

(c) Comparison of photocatalytic H2 evolution under different saturation conditions, and (d) summary of the photocatalytic H2-evolution activity under different saturation conditions. 
When CO2 was used to saturate the solution instead of N2, it was interesting to note that the produced H2 was 35.51 mmol g−1 in 3 h, i.e. 11.84 mmol g−1 h−1, as shown in Fig. 4c and d. To probe the possible mechanism of this phenomenon, CO32− ions and HCOOH were introduced into the reaction systems for comparison. It was found that with the introduction of a small amount of HCOOH, the photocatalytic H2-production activity of the sample was remarkably enhanced from 2.35 to 4.42 mmol g−1 h−1, while the CO32− ions did not show such an enhancement effect (Fig. S8†). These results suggest that some of the intermediates generated during the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 may play an important role in promoting the activity of photocatalytic H2 production of the sample, including but not limited to HCOOH. It was reported that the introduction of CO32− ions could significantly enhance the photocatalytic H2 production for K4Nb6O17 nanosheets.55 The photocatalytic H2-evolution activity of Zn–Tpy CONASH is superior to those of other reported non-noble metal–organic complex materials, such as Zn–TPY–TTF (530 μmol g−1 h−1),31 TPA-Zn (3011.1 μmol g−1 h−1),32 and BpZn–COP (1333 μmol g−1 h−1),56 as summarized in Table S1.† After further immobilizing or doping with noble metals, such as Pt and Au, the H2-evolution activity can be boosted to a higher level, such as in Pt@CdS@Cd(II)-MOF@TiO2,57 Pt@Zn–TPY–TTF CPG,31 Pt complex-immobilized MOF-253,58 and Au nanodots@thiol-UiO-66@ZnIn2S4 nanosheets,59 as summarized in Table S2.† In addition, besides H2 production, other fuels, including C2H4, CH4, C2H6, and CO, were also detected in the CO2-saturated system with evolution activities of 1.21, 15.73, 15.71, and 85.39 μmol g−1 h−1, respectively (Fig. S7†). The FT-IR spectra (Fig. S9†) confirmed there was no noticeable changes of the Zn–Tpy CONASH before and after the cyclic catalysis, suggesting the excellent photo- and chemical stabilities of these materials. These results clearly show the advantages and great potentials of the designed Zn–Tpy CONASH in photocatalytic H2 production.
The band structure and optoelectrical properties of 2D CONASH were further investigated by electrochemical and photoelectrical characterizations. Mott–Schottky (M–S) analyses were performed for Tpy and Zn–Tpy to evaluate the experimental feasibility of splitting water.60 It could be found from the M−S diagram that both the Tpy and Zn–Tpy structures have positive slopes (Fig. 5a), suggesting that they were both n-type semiconductors. The corresponding flat band potentials (Efb) of Tpy and Zn–Tpy were −1.25 V and −0.94 V (vs. SCE), respectively. Since the conduction band minimum (CBM) potential was close to the flat band potential (Vfb) of n-type semiconductors,61 the derived CBM for Tpy and Zn–Tpy CONASH were −1.01 V and −0.70 V (vs. NHE), respectively. Based on the band gap values obtained from UV-Vis-NIR spectroscopy, the valence band maximum potentials (VBM) of Tpy and Zn–Tpy were 1.57 V and 1.00 V (vs. NHE), respectively. The elaborate band potentials of CBM and VBM for Tpy and Zn–Tpy are shown in Fig. 5b. Accordingly, the reduction potential of water was lower than the CBM of Tpy and Zn–Tpy CONASH, suggesting that the semiconducting Tpy and Zn–Tpy can be applied as photoreduction catalysts for H2 production from water.

(e) Simulated electrostatic potential (ESP) of the Zn-Tpy and Tpy. The right images are the side views of the terpyridine regions for the structures. The calculated Mulliken atomic charges for typical atoms of the structures are labelled. 
Photocurrent measurements were performed both in the presence and absence of light irradiation (Fig. 5c). At the same potential (0.5 V vs. SCE), the photocurrent density of Tpy was 120 nA cm−1, while that of Zn–Tpy was 180 nA cm−1. This indicates that the Zn coordination promotes the separation and fast transportation of photogenerated carriers, thereby significantly enhancing the catalytic performance. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is a very powerful tool for evaluating the carrier-transfer capability.62 As shown in Fig. 5d, the arc radius of Zn-coordinated Zn–Tpy was smaller compared with the Tpy, indicating that the charge-transfer resistance at the solid–liquid interface was smaller, which is conducive for the rapid transfer of photogenerated carriers to the catalyst surfaces to trigger the photochemical reactions. To understand the differences in the observed photocatalytic performances, the electrostatic potential and deformation electron density of Zn–Tpy and Tpy ligand were simulated using Dmol3 module, Materials Studio.47,48 As shown in Fig. 5e, the negative and positive electrostatic potentials indicated electrophilic and nucleophilic regions, respectively. The calculated Mulliken atomic charges for Zn, O, and S atoms in the bridging Zn2(μ-O2SO2)2 structure were 0.793, −0.519, and 0.690 Ha e−1, respectively, suggesting the formation of a partially charged status and strong intramolecular electrostatic fields. This is critical for boosting the separation efficiency of the photogenerated electron–hole pairs and improving the photocatalytic activity and efficiency of the Zn–Tpy CONASH photocatalyst. As a comparison, the Mulliken atomic charges for the different atoms of Tpy ligand varied from −0.340 to 0.227 Ha e−1, with the difference much smaller than that of the Zn–Tpy. Besides, the deformation electron density maps of Tpy and Zn–Tpy also clearly showed a strong charge accumulation occurred in the Zn2(μ-O2SO2)2 region, as shown in Fig. S10.† These results explain the much enhanced photocatalytic activity of the coordinated Zn–Tpy well, which also indicates the importance of building intramolecular electrostatic fields through structural design in the development of 2D CONASH photocatalysts.
Conclusions
In summary, a novel 2D CONASH was designed and prepared through the coordination of Zn ions with bis-terpyridine ligand with the structure clarified by comprehensive microscopic, spectroscopic analyses and theoretical simulations. The Zn–Tpy CONASH exhibited n-type semiconductor properties with an optical band gap of 1.70 eV, stable orange-red photoluminescence emission at 638 nm, and VBM and CBM of 1.00 V and −0.70 V (vs. NHE), respectively. The experimental photocatalytic H2-evolution activity from water for Zn–Tpy CONASH was 3.10 mmol g−1 h−1 under the N2 atmosphere, and was remarkably enhanced up to 11.84 mmol g−1 h−1 after using CO2 for saturation instead, which are top ranking values among non-noble metal complexes and coordination compounds. The reduced band gap and strong built-in intramolecular electrostatic fields in the coordinated CONASH are responsible for the boosted photocatalytic H2 production. This work opens a new door for 2D CONASH structural and band designs, and their applications in photocatalytic H2 production.
