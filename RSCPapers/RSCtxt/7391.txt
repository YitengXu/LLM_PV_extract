    , Accepted 9th May 2016First published on 10th May 2016AbstractSubstantial efforts have been made in recent times in solving the major limiting factors affecting the efficiency of a photocatalyst. The fabrication of efficient junction architectures is one of the viable approaches to resolve this setback. We have developed a facile and systematic approach for the synthesis of anatase TiO2 (AT) nanoparticles and 1-D anatase and rutile TiO2 (ART) heterojunction nanorods to enhance the interfacial contact area by adjusting the titanium(IV) butoxide (TBOT) to titanium chloride (TiCl4) volume ratio. Their narrower band gap, increasing surface area and anatase phase composition engineered by adjusting the relative concentrations of titanium butoxide (TBOT) and titanium chloride (TiCl4) (TBOT/TiCl4, 1:0, 1:0.25, 1:1 and 1:4 v/v for ART-I, ART-II, ART-III and AT respectively) are also addressed. The materials showed impressive photocatalytic activity for H2 evolution from water/methanol and the photodegradation of organic pollutants like rhodamine B (RhB) and methylene blue (MB) dyes. ART-II showed superior activity (16.4 mmol g−1 h−1) with an apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of 7.7% together with its long-term stability. This is attributed to the synergistic effect observed in the mixed phase ART nanorod heterojunction photocatalyst. Methyl viologen (MV2+) has been used as a probe to elucidate the photocatalytic activities and highlight the heterojunction driven separation of photo-excited charge carriers for enhanced hydrogen production.
Introduction
The rational design of 1-D nanostructured materials such as nanorods, nanowires and nanotubes has extensively been pursued as a quintessential approach by virtue of their optical, electrochemical and thermo-mechanical properties. These features provide a great deal of opportunity to explore their novel properties in materials science as well as their use in a myriad of fields,1 especially for heterogeneous photocatalysis2 that is widely used for the degradation of pollutants in air/water, photo-electrochemical cells3 and H2 production.4 1-D TiO2 has been evidenced to manifest intrinsic advantages over the counterparts of TiO2 nanoparticles in terms of shape-dependent structures and properties. The major challenge of these nanostructured materials is their fast charge recombination, and hence tremendous effort has been put forward to develop a novel and facile synthetic approach for architecting 1-D oxide nanostructures, which can increase photocatalytic efficiency and effectively restrict the charge recombination.5
In heterogeneous photocatalysis, the anatase and rutile phases of TiO2 have received a great deal of attention in photocatalytic splitting of water for hydrogen generation and pollutant degradation. Anatase TiO2 is generally considered to be photo-active, but the anatase@rutile-TiO2 heterojunction exhibits superior photocatalytic activity.6 The enhanced performance of the mixed phase TiO2 is attributed to the easy transfer of electrons from their valence bands (VBs) to their conduction bands (CBs) due to their band gap overlapping.7 Moreover, the combined anatase and rutile phases of TiO2 slightly increase the CB energy of the rutile phase which allows the transfer of electrons from rutile to anatase TiO2 during photo-excitation and thus inhibits the charge recombination across the phase interfaces.8 The charge recombination process9 is actually a vital factor for determining the photocatalytic performance of TiO2 nanocomposites. Among the numerous popular techniques, photoluminescence spectroscopy is the most powerful technique for characterizing the recombination processes.10 This technique gives information on the irradiative recombination processes of photogenerated charge carriers. In this work, the time-resolved photoluminescence studies on TiO2 have been used to assess the lifetime of single and mixed phases in the carrier dynamics to understand the photolysis of TiO2.
To date, various synthetic methods have been used to develop the anatase and rutile heterojunction of TiO2 nanocomposites.11 Among them the solvothermal/hydrothermal method for synthesizing a precise and tunable morphology in mixed phase TiO2 nanoparticles is advantageous, since it has been shown to grow intact crystalline phases which depend on different reaction conditions including temperature, pH, reagents, and time.12 However, the synthesis of suitable photocatalysts with mixed phase anatase@rutile 1-D TiO2 nanorods using the solvothermal method with controlled size and morphology is a great challenge to the researchers. Many studies have been reported for the photocatalytic H2 production and photodegradation of industrial dyes on single phase TiO2 nanorods (TNRs).13,14 It has also been found that mixed phase TiO2 exhibits better performance than the single phase in the decomposition of various organic pollutants.14,15 However, understanding the role of the mixed phase heterojunction in synergistic electron transfer and its influence on photoactivity is yet to be revealed. Hence designing of an anatase@rutile heterojunction with a controlled particle morphology and surface chemistry using well-planned synthesis protocols is required. To the best of our knowledge, the effect of adjusting the volume ratio of Ti-precursors on the synthesis of mixed phase TiO2 nanorods using the solvothermal method has not been explored as yet.
In this work, we report a simple one-step solvothermal approach to fabricate anatase@rutile 1-D TiO2 heterojunction nanorods with enhanced interface contact area and anatase nanoparticles, such as ART-I, ART-II, ART-III and AT, by changing the volume ratio of TBOT/TiCl4 at 1:0, 1:0.25, 1:1 and 1:4. The crystallite phase-dependent synergistic effects for mixed anatase@rutile nanorods are systematically investigated on the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution from aqueous methanol. The as-synthesized materials showed high photocatalytic activity towards the photodegradation of RhB and MB, which are selected as probe molecules. The proposed charge transfer mechanism across the TiO2 heterojunction and the resultant activity enhancement are discussed. ART-II exhibits remarkably higher hydrogen production with a rate of 16.4 mmol g−1 h−1 under full-arc light irradiation. The photoinduced electron transfer efficiencies between the anatase and rutile interface were evidenced by using MV2+ reduction processes.
Experimental
All the reagents used for the synthesis of TiO2 nanorods and nanoparticles were commercially available. Titanium(IV) butoxide (TBOT, 97% purity, Sigma, USA) and anhydrous titanium(IV) chloride (TiCl4, ≥99.0% purity, Sigma, USA) were used as the titania precursors. Titanium(IV) oxide (mixture of rutile and anatase (35:65) nanoparticles, <100 nm particle size, 99.5% trace metals basis) as commercial TiO2 (cTiO2) and rutile TiO2 (RT) were purchased from Sigma (USA) to be used as reference catalysts. Hydrochloric acid (HCl, 37 wt%) and toluene (Merck, Germany) were used as received. Methyl viologen (N,N′-dimethyl-4,4′-bipyridinium dichloride, Sigma, USA) was used without further purification.
Synthesis of TiO2 nanorods and nanoparticles
TiO2 nanorods and nanoparticles were synthesized by using the modified method of previously reported literature.16 In a typical synthesis, a mixture of 10 mL toluene, 1 mL TBOT and 0.5 mL of hydrochloric acid (37 wt%) was added to different volumes of TiCl4 (0, 0.25, 1 and 4, Table S1 and Scheme S1, ESI†). Then the reaction mixtures were stirred at room temperature for 30 min to form homogeneous solutions. The resulting mixtures were charged in a sealed Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and heated at 150 °C for 20 h. Subsequently, the autoclave was cooled to room temperature naturally. The obtained samples were retrieved after centrifugation at 3500 rpm, washed with ethanol several times, and finally dried at 80 °C overnight. These final composites were labelled as ART-I, ART-II, ART-III and AT for a TBOT:TiCl4 volume ratio of 1:0, 1:0.25, 1:1 and 1:4 respectively. The as-prepared photocatalysts were annealed at 450 °C for 4 h. The reaction pathway of the formation of as-prepared catalysts has been explained in Scheme S1 (ESI†).
Photocatalytic H2 evolution
The photocatalytic activities of the prepared catalysts were analyzed using a doubly jacketed Pyrex glass reactor with a flat optical window and an external cooling jacket system. 10 mg of each catalyst was dispersed in 20 mL of aqueous solution containing 10 vol% of methanol (MeOH) as a sacrificial electron donor (SED). 1 wt% Pt was deposited on the surface of each catalyst with an aqueous solution of H2PtCl6 using the in situ photo-deposition method. It was then air sealed using a rubber septum. Prior to light irradiation, the photoreaction system was purged with high-purity argon for 30 min to remove air. A 450 W xenon arc lamp (Newport, USA and working at 400 W) was used for irradiating the suspended photocatalyst of the aqueous reaction mixture in the photoreactor, kept under constant stirring during the reaction. The evolved H2 gas was analyzed using a Perkin Elmer Clarus 580 gas chromatograph equipped with 5 Å molecular sieves, a column with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and argon as the carrier gas.
The apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) was estimated using the following eqn (1): (1) The average photon flux of the incident light was determined using an optical power/energy meter (Newport, model: 842-PE). All the photocatalytic hydrogen generation experiments were performed under the simulated solar light illumination of intensity ∼2.0 Sun (200 mW cm−2).
Results and discussion

ART nanorods and AT nanoparticles were successfully prepared using the solvothermal process using TBOT and TiCl4 precursors (Table S1, ESI†). The XRD patterns (Fig. 1) showed two peaks at around 25° and 27° corresponding to the diffraction peaks (101) and (110) of the anatase and rutile phases of TiO2 respectively. The BET surface area (Fig. 2) of the as-prepared samples increases (up to 70 m2 g−1) and FESEM and TEM (Fig. 3 and 4) images reveal the inherent growth of the nanorods with an increasing volume of TiCl4 in the TBOT solution. The absorption properties of the as-prepared samples exhibit narrowing of the band gap ranging from 3.01–3.15 eV (Fig. 5).

X-ray diffraction patterns
X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed to identify the phase composition and crystallinity of the prepared samples (Fig. 1). The peaks of the samples have been identified, where the rutile phase intensity is found to decrease and the anatase phase intensity to increase with the increase of TiCl4 concentration. The results depict that the increasing concentration of TiCl4 leads to a pure anatase phase (in AT, TBOT:TiCl4 is 1:4) suggesting that higher TiCl4 content preferentially leads to the anatase phase. The increased anatase peak fractions in ART-I, ART-II and ART-III photocatalysts are shown in Table 1. The characteristic diffraction peaks at 2θ values of 25°, 38°, 48° and 55° correspond to the (101), (103), (200) and (211) crystal planes of the anatase phase of TiO2 while diffraction peaks at 2θ values of 27°, 36°, 41°, 44°, 54°, 56°, 62° and 69° correspond to the indices of (110), (101), (200), (111), (210), (220), (002) and (301) planes, respectively, of the rutile phase of TiO2 (Table 1). It is worth noting that the 2θ values of the diffraction peaks are quite similar to those reported in the literature.17 The main peaks at 25° and 27° of the prepared samples are all very sharp, indicating good crystallinity.

The percentage of anatase and rutile phases in the as-prepared catalysts is calculated from XRD results using eqn (2) and (3) (2) WA = 1 − WR(3)where WR is the weight percentage of the rutile phase, and IR and IA are the integrated intensities of rutile (d110) and anatase (d101) peaks, respectively.18 As Table 1 reflects, the calculated compositions of anatase in the mixed phase increased to 29%, 57%, 95% and 100% with increasing volumes of TiCl4. A correspondence between the phase transformation and the optimal volume content of the precursor was clearly observed, affecting significantly the photocatalytic H2 generation.
In order to quantify the formation of different phase compositions of TiO2 nanostructures, the resulting %anatase phase and the amount of Ti precursors are shown in Fig. 1b. From the figure, it is clear that the increase in the amount of TiCl4 led to the increase in the amount of the anatase phase. The overall plot followed a first order pattern, as at a higher mass ratio of TiCl4 and TBOT no major change in the phase composition was observed. This is presumably due to controlled nucleation and growth driven by the TiCl4 precursor.19
Raman spectra
The phase composition of the ART-II was further confirmed from the Raman spectrum. As shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†), characteristic Raman bands shift at 144 and 517 cm−1, attributed to the Eg symmetry of the vibrational mode corresponding to the anatase phase of TiO2. In addition to the anatase TiO2, characteristic Raman bands at 231, 446, 611 and 826 cm−1, corresponding to the rutile modes, were also observed.20 The Raman spectrum, thus, reveals that in the ART-II sample anatase and rutile phases coexist.
As already reported in the literature, the photocatalytic activity depends on the surface area of the photocatalyst.21 Typically a high surface area and a suitable pore structure provide more active sites for the reactant molecules to favour the photocatalytic efficiency and increase the separation of the electron–hole pair of TiO2 nanoparticles. With this state, the BET surface areas of ART-I, ART-II, ART-III and AT are evaluated to be 54.58, 67.08, 69.15 and 53.63 m2 g−1, respectively, from the data points in nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms (the specific surface areas of the as-prepared samples are given in Table 1). That the as-prepared photocatalysts are mesoporous semiconductors is evidenced by the pore size and pore diameter of the nanoparticles (Table S2, ESI†). It is also noteworthy that the surface area of the TiO2 nanocomposite is enhanced with an increase in the loading amount of TiCl4. This might be playing an important role in improving the photocatalytic activity and reducing the charge recombination.21
SEM images
The morphology of the as-prepared TiO2 samples was characterized using FESEM (Fig. 3). The results indicate that the obtained ART-I (Fig. 3a and b) are small sized nanorods, ART-II (Fig. 3c and d) are monodispersed nanorods and ART-III (Fig. 3e and f) are composed of nanorod bundles. From these FESEM images, it is clear that with increasing volume of TiCl4 in the reaction mixture solution, the size and diameter of the nanorods vary from ART-I to ART-III. Further, the surface morphology changed from nanorods to nanoparticles in AT (Fig. 3g and h). This anisotropic growth and phase conversion of TiO2 is caused by the variable volume ratio of TiCl4. It may be due to the higher volume ratio of TiCl4 producing a steric hindrance in the mixture solution that serves as a barrier against the hydrolysis and increases the growth of TiO2 nanocomposites. Thus, the FESEM images imply that the volume ratio plays an important role in modulating the surface morphology.
TEM and HRTEM images
To address the structural properties of the as-prepared samples and to confirm their constituent nano-units, TEM analysis was employed (Fig. 4). The samples ART-II and ART-III contain both anatase and rutile phases in a heterojunction fashion while AT reveals only the anatase phase of TiO2 nanoparticles (Fig. S2, ESI†). Fig. 4a and c show the contractible and keen-edged nanorods to be arranged irregularly and the average diameters of the nanorods are 40 nm and 60 nm respectively. Fig. 4b and d demonstrate the magnified picture of the marked areas in Fig. 4a and c respectively. We found the lattice spacing of 0.357 nm in Fig. 4b, referring to the (101) plane of the anatase phase TiO2 nanorods. Rutile TiO2 nanorods with a (001) crystal lattice spacing of 0.294 nm are shown by yellow marks in Fig. 4b. Furthermore, the other form of crystalline phase symbiosis between anatase and rutile is displayed in the HRTEM image of Fig. 4d. In this image, the lattice distance of 0.357 nm (marked in blue) corresponds to the lattice space of the anatase TiO2(101) facet, while the inter-plane distance of 0.294 nm (marked in yellow) is the lattice space of the rutile TiO2(001) facet. The overlapping zone encircled in Fig. 4b and d is the most revealing feature found in the as-prepared photocatalyst. The continuity of this interfacial crossing zone between anatase and rutile is the key for the fast electron transfer and slow charge recombination under solar irradiation. The creation of a surface-phase junction between anatase and rutile could improve the intrinsic photocatalytic H2 evolution over TiO2 as reported by other researchers.7a,11c
UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra
UV-vis spectroscopy was used to analyze the optical absorption properties of the as-prepared samples. Fig. 5 shows that the as-prepared TiO2 nanorods and nanoparticles exhibit a pronounced absorption band ranging between 390 and 420 nm, which is ascribed to the promotion of electrons from the VB to the CB.22
A plot obtained via transformation based on the Kubelka–Munk function versus the energy of light (insets of Fig. 5) reveals the estimated band gaps of the as-prepared samples to be ca. 3.01, 3.08 and 3.15 eV corresponding to ART-(I & II), ART-III and AT composites respectively. This suggests a narrowing of the band gap of TiO2 due to the migration of electrons under a band energy gradient between the anatase and the rutile TiO2 in the heterojunction system.9c,20
Photoluminescence spectra
Photoluminescence spectroscopy (PL) is an important tool to investigate the recombination of the charge carriers in semiconductors.23Fig. 6a exhibits the room temperature PL spectra of the samples suspended in aqueous solution (pH 7.0) upon excitation at 370 nm. The PL spectra of the photocatalysts reveal two broad peaks at around 485 and 518 nm along with a sharp near-band edge UV emission peak at 423 nm. The emission intensity of ART-II is weaker compared with other used photocatalysts. ART-II shows lowest intensity (Fig. 6a), may be due to the deep level trap transition of the electrons from the CB to the VB24a or the capture of photo-generated holes by the keen-edge interface of anatase@rutile TiO2. This implies the enhanced separation of photo-generated holes and electrons in the anatase@rutile heterojunction resulting in the suppression of the charge recombination.24 This suppression in type-II heterojunction materials may be assigned to be responsible for increasing the rate of photocatalytic H2 generation.
 Fig. 6  (a) PL spectra of the samples. The sharp peak at around 423 nm defines the near-band edge UV emission (NBE). (b) Excitation dependent emission spectra of the ART-II photocatalyst in aqueous suspension. The red shifted emission spectra are shown in the insets. 
This property of the ART-II photocatalyst has further been analysed using excitation-wavelength-dependent PL (EWDP) spectroscopy (Fig. 6b). When the ART-II photocatalyst was excited at variable wavelengths from 370 nm to 380 nm with an interval of 5 nm, band maxima at 423 nm and 485 nm remain unaltered while the lowest energy photoluminescence peak shows a substantial red shift. Similar excitation wavelength dependence of the PL band maximum has already been reported for CeO2 nanoparticles by Goel et al. and is attributed to the recombination of electrons trapped in the defect band and the deeply trapped holes in oxygen vacancies.25 Thus, the excitation wavelength dependent PL study establishes the PL bands to be real.
Time-resolved photoluminescence
The charge carrier dynamics of the as-prepared TiO2 catalysts and conventional rutile TiO2 nanoparticles were analyzed using the time correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) method.26 Experimental details and the lifetime calculation method are provided in the ESI.† Fig. S3 (ESI†) shows the typical time-resolved fluorescence decays of the catalysts. The estimated lifetimes are provided in the ESI† (Table S3). It is pertinent to mention here that considering the resolution limit of the instrument, the lifetime values should be treated as qualitative ones, although the relative values for different samples are reliable. The values reveal that lifetimes of the carriers in the anatase@rutile mixed-phase are higher relative to the single phase TiO2. An increase in the relaxation time of type-II heterojunction materials is expected in the mixed phase of anatase@rutile TiO2. It shows the maximum capacity for capturing and storing electrons and acts as a better electron sink that prevents the charge recombination and improves the photocatalytic activity.
Photocatalytic hydrogen production
The photocatalytic activity of the as-prepared TiO2 nanorods and nanoparticles is quantitatively investigated by photocatalytic H2 generation from the suspension of photocatalysts in an aqueous solution of 10 vol% MeOH using full-arc light irradiation and compared with cTiO2. The results presenting the rate of hydrogen evolution are given in Fig. 7 and Table 1. Moreover, the time courses of photocatalytic H2 evolution yield of the as-prepared samples are depicted in Fig. S4a (ESI†). As shown in Fig. 7a and Fig. S4a (ESI†), for the ART-II photocatalyst, the H2-evolution rate reached the highest value of 16.4 mmol g−1 h−1 with an AQE of 7.7% under optimized reaction conditions. This is attributed to the factors like good crystallinity and a relatively high surface area providing more active sites and adsorbing more reactive species. It is well known that the coexistence of the anatase@rutile heterojunction reduces the charge recombination of the photo-produced electrons and holes, and thereby enhances the photocatalytic activity compared to the single phase of TiO2. Therefore, the as-synthesized anatase@rutile nanorods exhibit a H2-production rate significantly greater than anatase nanoparticles and ART-II reveals a 25 fold higher rate of hydrogen evolution than that of cTiO2 and ∼95 fold higher than that of RT. The obtained H2 efficiency of ART-II is significantly greater than various other TiO2-based photocatalysts (see Table S4 in the ESI†).

The stability of a catalyst is a critical factor ensuring its durability during photocatalytic hydrogen generation.27 Photocatalytic stability tests were conducted for the as-prepared samples at the optimal reaction parameter. The stabilities of the photocatalysts were evaluated at one-hour intervals during 6 h irradiation of the hydrogen production process (Fig. 7b). After the first run, the catalyst was kept in the dark and separated from the suspension. The recovered photocatalyst was then used for the second to fifth run of photo-reduction under the same reaction conditions with a fresh addition of sacrificial reagents. As shown in Fig. 7b the hydrogen yield of ART-II was 98.4 mmol g−1 in the first run, reached the maximum at the second run (105 mmol g−1), then again came down giving quite similar values as obtained in first run. These results indicate that the as-prepared photocatalysts are recyclable and reusable for photocatalytic hydrogen production.
Photocatalytic dye degradation
To evaluate the photocatalytic potential of the anatase@rutile heterostructures, the degradation of RhB and MB under full-arc irradiation was tested as a model system. In a typical measurement, 10 mg of each photocatalyst was suspended in 30 mL of 1 × 10−5 M aqueous solution of RhB and MB dyes. The solution was stirred in the dark for 30 minutes to achieve the equilibrium adsorption. The suspension was then illuminated using a 450 W Xe lamp (working at 400 W). The RhB and MB concentration change was monitored by measuring the optical absorbance of the suspensions at 552 nm and 668 nm, respectively, at regular intervals. The colours and absorption spectral changes of RhB and MB solution under full arc light irradiation in the presence of the ART-II photocatalyst are shown in Fig. S5 and S6 (ESI†). The correlation curves between the concentration of MB and RhB solution and the irradiation time are shown in Fig. 8 using ART-I, ART-II, ART-III, AT and RT as photocatalysts. The photodegradation of dyes in the presence of pure anatase (AT) and rutile (RT) was relatively slow, with 85% and 75% for RhB and 80% and 70% for MB after 60 min illumination. While the photodegradation of RhB and MB in the presence of ART-II was much faster, with a conversion rate of up to 95% and 90% after 60 min, respectively. The comparison of the photocatalytic efficiency of various other TiO2 based catalysts with MB and RhB dyes is listed in Table S5 (ESI†).

The photodegradation kinetics were fitted to a pseudo-first-order reaction (C0/C = ekt), where k is the apparent rate constant. While concerning the potentiality for the degradation of RhB over the studied catalysts, ART-II exhibited a rate constant of 0.0437 min−1 which is higher than that of AT and RT (0.032 and 0.0213 min−1) respectively. This reflects that a 1-D monodispersed nanostructure is beneficial for directional transport and efficient charge carrier separation during photocatalysis.28Fig. 8c and d also reveals that the degradation rate decreases with an increase in the dye concentration.29 The ART-II photocatalyst was reused five times to decompose RhB and MB dyes in order to explore the stability under full-arc irradiation. It can be observed from Fig. S7 (ESI†) that the ART-II photocatalyst shows high reproducibility during the course of the reaction, and its photocatalytic efficiency retained nearly 90% with MB and 95% with RhB after five cycles of repetition. These results demonstrate that ART-II has good stability during the photocatalytic reaction.
Linear scan voltammetry (LSV)
The photoactivities of ART-II, AT and RT were further studied by measuring the photocurrent using LSV in the dark and under full-arc light irradiation.30 As shown in Fig. S4b (ESI†), mixed-phase ART-II nanorods showed a higher current than single phase AT and RT nanoparticles under identical experimental conditions. A high photocurrent indicates that the sample has a strong ability to generate and transfer the photoexcited charge carriers under irradiation.31 The enhanced photoactivity of ART-II, thus, suggests that mixed-phase ART nanorods have superior ability for electron and hole pair separation than the single phase AT and RT, consistent with the PL and time-resolved PL spectra.
Photocatalytic reduction of MV2+
The photocatalytic activities of ART-II, AT and RT were tested with MV2+ to probe their photoinduced electron transfer efficiencies.32 MV2+ is a system of choice in this regard because it possesses a pH independent reduction potential of E0(MV2+/MV+˙) = −0.446 V, magnitude-wise similar to that of H+/H2 at pH = 7.33 Furthermore, Fig. 9a shows that the ECB values of anatase and rutile TiO2 are more negative than E0 such that MV+˙ radical cation formation is expected in all the systems. As an added benefit, the MV2+ + e− → MV+˙ reduction, as depicted in eqn (4), was monitored in situ using the discernible rise of the MV+˙ absorbance at 605 nm (corresponding to the absorbance of MV+˙) under 1 min light illumination. The change of color is pictorially presented in Fig. 9b. We observed that ART-II produces MV+˙ 2.7 and 8 times more compared to AT and RT respectively. However, there is no significant difference between the energetics of the CB for different TiO2 nanorods. This indeed stands out to be direct evidence for the efficient separation of photoexcited electrons between the anatase and rutile interfaces. The results also imply a greater accumulation of electrons in the CB of anatase in the hybrid composite system in support of the fact reported by Scanlon and co-workers.8c (4)Based on these results, the basic mechanism of H2 evolution is discussed, including the vital points that influence the catalytic activities. We believe that the enhancement of photocatalytic H2 evolution is the culminating effect of the two facts: (i) photoexcited electrons into the CB of the individual phases of TiO2 separately reduce the water via cocatalysts and (ii) inhibition of the charge recombination via migration of electrons under a band energy gradient between the anatase and rutile phases of TiO2 in the heterojunction system (Scheme 1). On the other hand, the photogenerated holes are capable of methanol oxidation, either directly or through the formation of hydroxyl radicals, to form hydroxymethyl radicals. In the absence of dissolved oxygen,34 the hydroxymethyl radical efficiently injects an additional electron into the TiO2 CB. It is known that the work function of the rutile phase is 0.2 eV lower than that of the anatase phase, placing the conduction band of anatase 0.2 eV below the rutile phase.35 Based on this, the plausible reason for enhanced H2 production is assigned to the heterojunction driven movement of the photo-excited electrons from the rutile to anatase portion and better accumulation of electrons at the CB of the anatase counterpart of the hybrid composite as evidenced by the MV2+ reduction experiment. Eventually, this can effectively compete with the recombination process at the TiO2–SED interface. The electron-depleted anatase phase occupies the surface of the rutile phase. As a consequence, lowering of the recombination rate at the rutile–SED interface cannot be ruled out.

The high photocatalytic efficiency of the anatase@rutile mixture in aqueous methanol may also be attributed to perceive their morphology. The 1-D morphology of ART composites facilitates the separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs efficiently by lengthening the lifetime of the charge carriers and therefore, exhibiting a high rate of hydrogen generation. The factual understanding based on the above analysis well supports the mechanism behind the role of the heterojunction for enhanced hydrogen production.
Conclusion
In summary, we have developed a one-pot solvothermal approach for synthesizing 1-D anatase and rutile TiO2 heterojunction nanorods and anatase TiO2 nanoparticles with a combination of features attractive for photocatalysis. The engineered photocatalysts feature with variable anatase phase compositions (29–100%), a relatively high surface area (up to 70 m2 g−1) and a narrower band gap energy (3.01–3.14 eV). The optimal anatase@rutile phase ratio was found to be 57:43 (ART-II), which resulted in a high H2-evolution rate of 16.4 mmol h−1 g−1 and a corresponding apparent quantum efficiency of 7.7% with 1 wt% of Pt as a cocatalyst. The obtained result is 25 fold higher than that of the commercial TiO2 under the same experimental conditions. Moreover, photocatalytic degradation rates of RhB (95%) and MB (90%) with ART-II were higher than with others. The highest photocatalytic activity of the ART-II photocatalyst was due to the monodispersed morphology and tunable phase composition. This unambiguously reflects the role of the heterojunction in fast interfacial electron transfer and better charge separation. We believe that the present work will provide a useful guidance to achieve enhanced photocatalytic activity towards both hydrogen production and degradation of organic pollutants, and will highlight more application potential of anatase@rutile heterojunction materials in the field of energy conversion.
