    , Accepted 27th May 2019First published on 30th May 2019AbstractBifacial photovoltaic technology has been established as an effective strategy for increasing electric power generation while reducing the area-related costs of silicon solar cells. For third-generation solar cells of organolead halide perovskites, the monofacial power conversion efficiency (PCE) has exceeded 23%. Therefore, the development of efficient bifacial cells is expected, but the top transparent electrode is a crucial obstacle that must be overcome. In this work, ultrathin silver (Ag) film was selected as the top transparent electrode and, particularly, a tellurium oxide (TeO2) optical coupling layer was adopted to enhance the transmittance of the Ag film in the visible light region, which markedly increased the light absorption of devices. Compared with PSCs with a pure Ag electrode, the device with a TeO2 (40 nm)/Ag (11 nm) top electrode showed significantly enhanced bifacial short-circuit current-density and bifacial PCEs of 18.86% (illuminated from the ITO electrode) and 15.12% (illuminated from the Ag electrode). Consequently, in addition to its role as a transmittance enhancement layer, TeO2 acted as a back reflector when the device was illuminated from the ITO side. Furthermore, a previously proposed phenylethylammonium iodide treatment method was adopted to improve charge transport at the perovskite/fullerene interface. Remarkably, the device achieved champion bifacial PCEs of 20.96% (ITO side) and 17.36% (Ag side), a bifaciality factor of 82.82%, and a steady PCE output and good reproducibility. The large-area device (1 cm2) achieved bifacial PCEs of 12.42% (ITO side) and 10.55% (Ag side), with better performance predicted by simulations. Therefore, the TeO2/Ag films are promising transparent electrodes for fabricating cost-effective bifacial PSCs.
1. Introduction
Organolead halide perovskites have attracted increasing attention in optoelectronic and electronic devices owing to their advantages, including an adjustable band gap, long charge diffusion lengths, high carrier mobility, a high absorption coefficient, solution process methods, and low cost.1–11 In particular, perovskite-based solar cells have shown a rapid improvement in power conversion efficiency (PCE) from 3.8% to 23%.12,13 To further improve the PCE, the tandem structure with inorganic cells has been an effective approach.14,15 Meanwhile, fabricating bifacial cells that can absorb solar light from both the top and bottom sides of the cell is a more cost-effective strategy. This concept has been applied in silicon, III–V, CIGS, and DSSC solar cells,16–21 and a 50% increase in output power has been obtained in silicon bifacial devices by collecting surrounding albedo radiation.22 Therefore, bifacial devices are suggested to be able to increase electric power generation while reducing area-related costs of PSCs.
A crucial factor limiting performance improvements of bifacial PSCs come from the lack of efficient transparent electrodes. Today, commercial indium tin oxide (ITO) and fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) are the most commonly used bottom transparent electrodes, while conducting polymers, silver nanowires (Ag NWs), graphene, ultrathin metal films, and ITO have been used as the top transparent electrodes23–31 in bifacial or semitransparent PSCs. Among these electrodes, sputtered ITO usually requires post-annealing treatment (>200 °C) to further lower the resistance, and the high kinetic energy of sputtered particles tends to damage the underlying fullerene or spiro-OMeTAD layers.27 The increasing price of ITO and toxicity of indium are not suitable for cost-effective PSCs. The acidity of a conducting poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate top electrode might be harmful to long-term PSC stability. The relatively complex preparation of low-resistance multilayer graphene electrodes and relatively poor reproducibility of Ag NW top electrodes must be further optimized. Ultrathin metal film electrodes possess the advantages of good conductivity, a mature process, and mass production, while poor transmittance in the visible light and near-infrared regions limits their direct application as transparent electrodes.32–34 Fortunately, the poor transmittance of metal films can be markedly improved by introducing an optical couple layer or capping layer.35–39 Chen et al.15 employed a Cu/Au top transparent electrode and obtained bifacial PCEs of 16.5% (ITO side) and 12.1% (Au side). Our previous reports5,34 also showed that PSCs with a Ag/V2O5 (and Ag/MoO3) top electrode could achieve bifacial PCEs of 14.01% (13.55%) and 8.91% (8.41%) when the devices were illuminated from the ITO and Ag sides, respectively. Although metal films are promising top transparent electrodes, the low efficiency of bifacial PSCs still requires improvement.
In this work, the optical coupling layer of tellurium oxide (TeO2) was adopted to improve the optical transmittance of an ultrathin Ag film (11 nm) transparent electrode and fabricate high-performance bifacial PSCs. TeO2 has been widely used in acousto-optic (AO) devices owing to its high refractive index, high AO figure of merit, high dielectric constant, wide bandgap, negligible solubility in water, and good mechanical stability.39,40 The validity of the TeO2 coupling layer for enhancing Ag transmittance has also been predicted in our previous calculations of microcavity organic and perovskite solar cells.41,42 The transmittance experiments herein confirmed the role of the TeO2 transmittance enhancement layer, with an optimal TeO2 thickness of about 40 nm. The resulting PSC achieved an obviously enhanced bifacial short-circuit current-density (JSC) of 19.56 mA cm−2 and PCE of 15.12% when illuminated from the Ag side. Simultaneously, the JSC and PCE of the PSC increased to 23.82 mA cm−2 and 18.86%, respectively, when illuminated from the ITO side, which showed that TeO2 also acted as a back reflector. Furthermore, by adopting the phenylethylammonium iodide (PEAI) treatment method43–46 to enhance charge transport at the perovskite/fullerene interface, we report high-performance PSCs with champion bifacial PCEs of 20.96% (ITO side) and 17.36% (Ag side), and a bifaciality factor of 82.82%. Compared to PSCs without a TeO2 coupling layer and PEAI treatment, the bifacial PCE had been increased by 71% (ITO side) and 137% (Ag side). The steady output characteristics and statistical results show the steady PCE output and good reproducibility of our bifacial PSCs. The large-area device (1 cm2) obtained bifacial PCEs of 12.42% (ITO side) and 10.55% (Ag side). The simulation results showed that higher bifacial PCEs and bifaciality factors (99%) were obtained when the Ag thickness decreased to 8 nm. Therefore, both experiments and the simulations results showed that thermal evaporated TeO2/Ag films are promising transparent electrodes for fabricating cost-effective bifacial PSCs.
2. Methods
Theoretical calculations based on transfer matrix formulas and drift diffusion equations were adopted to investigate the effect of thickness (TeO2, Ag) on the current density–voltage characteristics of bifacial PSCs illuminated from opposite directions (ITO or Ag sides). In the transfer matrix formulas, it was assumed that each layer was uniform and homogeneous, all interfaces were parallel and perpendicular to the incident light, and the plane waves were used to depict incident light.47,48 In the theoretical calculations, the device had the same geometry as the experiments, with glass/ITO (180 nm)/NiOx (40 nm)/perovskite (500 nm)/PCBM (45 nm)/Ag/TeO2. The selected Ag thickness was 11 nm and 8 nm, and TeO2 layer thickness varied from 0 to 80 nm. The selected thickness of each layer was based on our previous experiments4,49,50 and the detailed calculation method can be found in the ESI† or in our previous work.51,52
The fabricated bifacial PSCs had an inverted planar structure of glass/ITO/NiOx/perovskite/PC61BM/BCP/Ag/TeO2, as shown in Fig. 1(a). The detailed PSC fabrication process and characterization method are described in the ESI.† ITO was used as the bottom transparent electrode. Inorganic solution-processed NiOx acted as the hole transport layer, which has been proven to be more efficient than PEDOT:PSS for extracting photogenerated holes from perovskite and improving the device stability.4 Spin-coated FA0.3MA0.7PbI3−xClx prepared using the two-step method was selected as the perovskite light absorber. PCBM was used as the electron transport layer and passivation layer, and the BCP interfacial layer was used to modify energy levels at the PCBM/Ag interface.50 For the reference PSCs, 100 nm Ag was evaporated as the opaque electrode, and the ITO/NiOx/perovskite/PCBM/BCP/Ag structure was successfully used to achieve an efficiency of over 20%, as in our previous report.4 Herein, the ultrathin Ag films were used as the top transparent electrode and, in particular, a TeO2 layer with an optical band gap of about 3.80 eV (Fig. S1†) was employed to decrease the reflectivity and increase the optical transmittance of Ag film. This effect of TeO2 was previously studied by us using theoretical calculations41,42 and confirmed in this paper in experimental PSCs. The resulting devices could absorb light from both the top and bottom transparent electrodes.

3. Results and discussion
Undoubtedly, the optical transmittance of the Ag top electrode and the crystal quality of the perovskite material were key factors in obtaining high-performance bifacial PSCs. Photographs and the optical transmittance of Ag (11 nm)/glass, TeO2 (20, 40, 50 nm)/Ag (11 nm)/glass, ITO/glass, and glass samples are shown in Fig. 1(a) and (b). The glass sample clearly showed the highest transmittance of over 90%, with the average transmittance of ITO exceeding 80% in the visible light wavelength range. For the ultrathin Ag film electrode deposited by thermal evaporation, the percolation threshold thickness was proven to be 11 nm in our laboratory, and the corresponding sheet resistance was lower than 10 Ω □−1.53 However, the 11 nm Ag film only showed a maximum transmittance of 70% at 360 nm and a rapid decrease in the visible region. This poor transmittance limited its direct application as a transparent electrode. With a 20 nm TeO2 optical coupling layer deposited on Ag film, only transmittance at the wavelength below 460 nm was enhanced. When the TeO2 layer thickness increased to 40 nm, obviously improved transmittance was obtained for the TeO2/Ag electrode in the visible light range, with a highest transmittance of over 80%. This was a relatively high average transmittance compared with that of the TeO2 (50 nm)/Ag (11 nm) sample. In particular, the TeO2/Ag electrode showed slightly better transmittance at lower wavelengths (<350 nm) than ITO, which might increase the possibility of light absorption at relatively low wavelengths by the perovskite layer. This was attributed to surface plasmonic effect-induced large optical dissipation at the dielectric layer/Ag interface being suppressed by deposition of the high dielectric TeO2 layer (εTeO2 = 25) on the Ag film electrode (εAg = 9.7).54 Therefore, the TeO2 (40 nm)/Ag (11 nm) film was selected as the top transparent electrode for bifacial PSCs. To increase the light absorption of the bifacial PSCs, the two-step method was used to deposit a thicker FA0.3MA0.7PbI3−xClx layer. After crystallization of the perovskite layer, MAI/PEAI solution in IPA/DMF was further spin-coated on the perovskite, followed by annealing at 100 °C to recrystallize. Both the SEM image and XRD diffraction results (Fig. 1) showed the pin-hole free surface topography and good crystal quality of the perovskite layer. This PEAI treatment resulted in the 2D/3D mixed perovskite structure, which passivated the trap states in the perovskite layer and enhanced charge transport at the perovskite/fullerene interface. The physical mechanism has been discussed previously,43–46 and the effect of PEAI treatment was confirmed by the photovoltaic performance of the bifacial PSCs.
To investigate the bifacial photovoltaic performance of PSCs, five types of device, devices A–E, were fabricated. Fig. 2 shows the detailed device structures and their J–V characteristics under AM 1.5G illumination. The corresponding photovoltaic parameters are shown in Table 1. Device A with a pure Ag top electrode showed inferior performance, with a PCE of 7.33% (12.27%), VOC of 1.06 V (1.08 V), JSC of 11.64 mA cm−2 (18.54 mA cm−2), and FF of 59.38% (61.27%) when illuminated from the Ag side (ITO side). However, reference device E with an opaque Ag (100 nm) electrode and PEAI-treated perovskite layer achieved a PCE of 21.34% with a VOC of 1.10 V, JSC of 24.22 mA cm−2, and FF of 80.44%. Therefore, the low JSC and FF of device A were responsible for its poor bifacial PCE. When the TeO2 coupling layer was employed in device B, a markedly enhanced JSC of 19.56 mA cm−2 (Ag side) compared with that of device A (11.64 mA cm−2) led to a doubling of the PCE (Ag side) from 7.33% to 15.12%. This was attributed to the light transmittance enhancement of the Ag electrode and light absorption improvement in the PSCs. Meanwhile, the improved JSC and PCE of device B illuminated on the ITO side suggested that the TeO2 coupling layer also acted as a back-reflector, decreasing light absorption loss in the PSCs. When the PEAI treatment method was adopted, device C exhibited an obviously increased FF and slightly increased VOC, which was attributed to improved charge extraction and suppressed nonradiative charge recombination.43–46 Although the JSC was slightly decreased, device C gave an improved overall PCEs of 16.07% (ITO side) and 8.40% (Ag side). Therefore, the TeO2 coupling layer was effective at enhancing the JSC (comparison of devices A and B) and the PEAI-treated perovskite layer helped improve the FF and VOC (comparison of devices A and C). The combination of these two strategies might be used to further enhance the bifacial performance of PSCs.

As shown in Fig. 2 and Table 1, device D employing the 40 nm TeO2 coupling layer and PEAI-treated perovskite layer achieved superior bifacial performance. When the device was illuminated from the ITO side, a champion PCE of 20.25% with VOC of 1.12 V, JSC of 22.54 mA cm−2, and FF of 80.25% were achieved, which were comparable to those of reference device E (opaque Ag electrode). For the Ag side, device D exhibited a PCE of 16.75% with VOC of 1.10 V, JSC of 19.56 mA cm−2, and FF of 79.27%. The bifaciality factor21 of the PSCs was calculated as 82.72%. Compared with device A, the bifacial PCE of device D had increased by 65% (ITO side) and 128% (Ag side), the JSC had increased by 22% (ITO side) and 68% (Ag side), the FF had increased by 31% (ITO side) and 33% (Ag side), and the VOC had increased slightly. These improvements were attributed to the integration effect of the TeO2 optical coupling layer and PEAI-treated perovskite layer. To our knowledge, this is the first time a PCE of over 20% and bifaciality factor of over 80% to be achieved by bifacial PSCs with ITO and Ag transparent electrodes. Furthermore, using a glass mirror as a back reflector during the J–V measurement of device D enhanced the bifacial PCEs to 22.51% (ITO side) and 21.49% (Ag side), with a bifaciality factor 95.47%. This was attributed to the absorption of additional light reflected by the mirror, which further demonstrated the efficient photovoltaic conversion of device D. To further evaluate its performance, the current hysteresis, IPCE, steady current or PCE output, and statistical results were next investigated.

Fig. 3(a) shows the J–V characteristics in the forward scan (−0.2 V to 1.2 V) and reverse scan (1.2 V to −0.2 V) with a scan voltage step of 0.01 V. The reverse scan result of device D is shown in Table 1, while the forward scan result at the ITO side (Ag side) gave a PCE of 18.83% (15.42%), VOC of 1.18 V (1.08 V), JSC of 22.35 mA cm−2 (18.38 mA cm−2), and FF of 76.58% (77.64%). The calculated hysteresis factors55 (1 − PCEforward/PCEreverse) were 7% (ITO side) and 8% (Ag side), both of which were higher than that of opaque (100 nm Ag) device E (about 2%; see ESI, Fig. S2†). This might be related to the ultrathin Ag (11 nm) electrode suffering from a higher electric field intensity (same voltage), which might result in more Ag diffusion and increased interfacial charge accumulation. The bifacial IPCE spectra and integrated JSC of device D are shown in Fig. 3(b). The ITO-side IPCE clearly exhibited larger values at long wavelength (450–800 nm) and slightly lower values at low wavelengths (below 350 nm), which was in good agreement with the optical transmittance results of ITO and TeO2/Ag electrodes in Fig. 1. The difference in the wavelength-dependent integrated JSC values of different illumination directions at long wavelengths was in line with the IPCE results. Simultaneously, the integrated JSC values from IPCEs were 21.21 mA cm−2 (ITO side) and 18.44 mA cm−2 (Ag side), which were well matched with the measured JSC values from the J–V curves. Fig. 3(c) and (d) show the steady current-density and PCE output at the maximum power point (Vmax) for 160 s under continuous illumination. Notably, device D showed superior steady current density and PCE output characteristics for different illumination directions, maintaining the bifacial power output of PSCs. Furthermore, the statistical data from ten cells are summarized in Fig. 4, and the Gaussian distributions of bifacial PCE, VOC, JSC, and FF values showed good process repeatability for the bifacial PSCs with the TeO2 (40 nm)/Ag transparent electrode. The champion bifacial PCEs were 20.96% (ITO side) and 17.36% (Ag side), with a bifaciality factor of 82.82%.

According to the above discussion, the light transmittance of the TeO2/Ag top electrode or the JSC value were concluded to dominate the device performance under illumination from the Ag side. We next investigated whether it was possible to further improve the bifacial performance of PSCs by optimizing the structure parameters. For different TeO2 thicknesses of 50 and 20 nm, the fabricated PSCs showed lower JSC values (Ag side) of 18.40 mA cm−2 and 15.96 mA cm−2 than that of 40 nm TeO2-PSCs (19.56 mA cm−2). To further investigate the influence of thickness, we simulated the bifacial performance of PSCs using the transfer matrix method and drift-diffusion equations. The inset in Fig. 5(a) shows the dependence of the bifacial JSC value on the TeO2 thickness, and the optimal thickness was 40 nm, which was in agreement with the experimental results. Furthermore, the J–V characteristics of bifacial PSCs with the TeO2 (40 nm)/Ag (11 nm) transparent electrode are shown in Fig. 5(a), and the corresponding bifacial PCE, VOC, JSC, and FF at the ITO side (Ag side) were 23.20% (20.82%), 1.15 V (1.15 V), 24.76 mA cm−2 (22.49 mA cm−2), and 81.56% (80.27%), respectively, with the bifaciality factor reaching 89%. Furthermore, the percolation threshold of Ag film thickness has been reported to be as low as 8 nm,56 meaning that higher transmittance of the Ag film is possible. As a result, we also simulated bifacial PSCs with TeO2/Ag (8 nm) transparent electrodes. As shown in Fig. 5(b), the optimal TeO2 thickness was also about 40 nm, and the corresponding bifacial PCE, VOC, JSC, and FF values at the ITO side (Ag side) were 22.65% (22.53%), 1.15 V (1.15 V), 24.19 mA cm−2 (24.24 mA cm−2), and 81.58% (80.43%), respectively, with the bifaciality factor reaching 99%. Furthermore, as shown in Fig. S3 and S4,† the TeO2 thickness had no significant influence on the FF and VOC of PSCs with an 8 nm or 11 nm Ag top electrode, which confirmed that the JSC values dominated the overall bifacial PCE values. In conclusion, both the experimental and theoretical results confirmed that the TeO2/Ag film was the most promising transparent electrode for the fabrication of bifacial PSCs with high performance.

Inset represents the dependence of JSC on the thickness of the TeO2 optical coupling layer and Ag films. 
Finally, we attempted to fabricate bifacial PSCs (device F) with a larger active area of 1 cm2. As shown in Fig. 6 and Table 1, device F achieved a PCE of 12.42% with a VOC of 1.14 V, JSC of 16.38 mA cm−2, and FF of 66.49% at the ITO side, and a PCE of 10.55% with a VOC of 1.12 V, JSC of 14.05 mA cm−2, and FF of 67.05% at the Ag side, as well as a bifaciality factor of 85%. Compared with small-area PSCs, the relatively low JSC and FF of device F limited the overall bifacial PCEs, which was attributed to relatively weak charge extraction and strong charge recombination related to increased defects and traps in the larger-area perovskite layer. The insets of Fig. 6 show photographs of large-area bifacial PSCs (taken from the Ag side) and the bifacial transmittance of device F. Notably, incident light below 600 nm was absorbed completely and the transmittance rapidly increased when the wavelength was close to or larger than the absorption cutoff edge of the perovskite material. Therefore, the thermally evaporated TeO2/Ag film transparent electrode can be used to fabricate bifacial PSCs, with its advantages further manifested in large-area devices. In future work, the photovoltaic performance of large-area bifacial PSCs could be further improved by precisely controlling the perovskite process conditions, Ag deposition, and interface modification, among others.

Conclusions
In this study, we adopted a tellurium oxide (TeO2) layer to improve the light transmittance of an 11 nm Ag film transparent electrode and PEAI-treated perovskite layer, and fabricated high-performance bifacial PSCs. When illuminated from the ITO bottom electrode, the device showed a champion PCE of 20.96%, and when illuminated from the TeO2/Ag top electrode, the same device achieved a PCE of 17.36%, with a bifaciality factor of 82.82%. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a bifacial PSC with a PCE of over 20% and bifaciality factor exceeding 80%. Both experimental and simulation results showed that the thermally evaporated TeO2/Ag films are promising transparent electrodes for fabricating efficient bifacial PSCs. This bifacial photovoltaic technology is a cost-effective strategy for improving the overall efficiency of PSCs and boosting their commercialization.
