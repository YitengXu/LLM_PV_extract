Through employing thiazole units as the π-bridges, nitrogen⋯sulfur noncovalent conformational locks were introduced to enhance the rigidity and planarity of the backbone, and thus reduce the reorganization energy, increase the charge transport mobility, and enhance the photovoltaic performance.

The organic solar cells based on the IDT-Tz electron acceptor exhibit power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) as high as 8.4%, which is significantly higher than the PCE (4.1%) of the IDT-T based devices. This work demonstrated a novel strategy for enhancing the PCE of organic solar cells through introducing noncovalent conformational locks, which will be promising in designing novel high-performance non-fullerene materials.
Introduction
The past few decades have witnessed a huge success in organic solar cells (OSCs), due to their unique advantages of low cost, mechanical flexibility and chemical versatility, in addition to their environmentally benign solar energy production.1–3 OSCs based on the bulk heterojunction (BHJ) structure with an electron acceptor and an electron donor have afforded high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of >10%.4–9 In a long period of time, fullerenes and their derivatives have been considered as the most successful electron accepting materials due to their high electron mobility, large electron affinity and isotropic electron-transporting ability.10 Nevertheless, fullerene materials suffer from several intrinsic defects, including limited spectral absorption, high production costs, restricted energy level tuning, and morphology instability, which limit their practical applications.
Recently, considerable efforts have been devoted to developing non-fullerene electron acceptors, which have generated promising PCEs.11–15 In order to develop high performance non-fullerene acceptors, aromatic fused ring structures with high planarity have been widely used, which can facilitate π-electron delocalization and enhance intermolecular charge transport.16,17 Many high performance non-fullerene acceptors containing fused ring building blocks exemplified by 4,9-dihydro-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]-dithiophene (IDT), benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) and 6,12-dihydro-dithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene (IDTT) have been reported with excellent photovoltaic performance.18–22 However, this strategy to some extent suffers from the drawback of requiring extra synthetic steps, which may compromise cost-effectiveness.23 Thus an alternative strategy is to enhance intramolecular rigidification through introducing noncovalent interactions within the aromatic backbones.23 Introducing noncovalent intramolecular interactions, being well-known as “noncovalent conformational locks”, has become a widely employed strategy to design highly planar π-conjugated systems for high performance organic electronics.24,25 Specifically, noncovalent through-space intramolecular interactions, including N⋯S, O⋯S, X⋯S (X = halide) and hydrogen-bonding interactions between the neighboring aromatic rings, have been employed to promote the planarities of both macromolecules and small molecules.26–30
In 2015, Zhan et al. reported a small molecule (IDT-T) with IDT as the core and thiophene as π-bridges.31 In combination with PBDTTT-C-T as the donor, this nonfullerene acceptor demonstrated a respectable PCE of 3.93% with a high open circuit voltage (VOC), yet a low short-circuit current (JSC) and fill factor (FF), which may be ascribed to its relatively low exciton splitting efficiency and charge transport mobility.32 Therefore, we developed a novel type of IDT-based small molecular acceptor (IDT-Tz) using thiazole as π-bridges to replace thiophene in IDT-T. Thiazole is an extensively used electron-accepting hetero-cyclic compound because of its electron deficient nature.33 The electronegative nitrogen atom can reduce the LUMO energy level of the thiazole-based molecule in comparison to IDT-T, which may increase the difference of the LUMO energy levels between the donor and acceptor (ΔELUMO) to provide an enhanced driving force for efficient exciton dissociation, resulting in higher JSC in OSCs.33–35 Furthermore, the nitrogen atom of the thiazole unit and the sulfur atom of the IDT unit may form nitrogen⋯sulfur (N⋯S) noncovalent conformational locks to enhance the rigidity and planarity of the backbone, and thus reduce the reorganization energy and increase the charge transport mobility, leading to an improved FF.36,37 The optical spectra, energy levels, charge transport mobility, thin film morphologies and device performances of the thiazole and thiophene substituted acceptors were fully investigated, which showed that the material properties and device performances were significantly influenced by simply replacing CH moieties with N atoms. As a result, PTB7-Th:IDT-Tz blend based OSCs exhibit a high PCE of 8.4%, which is significantly higher than the PCE (4.1%) of the PTB7-Th:IDT-T based devices. This contribution demonstrated a novel strategy for enhancing the PCE of organic solar cells through introducing N⋯S noncovalent conformational locks, which sheds light on designing novel high-performance non-fullerene materials.
Results and discussion
The synthetic route to IDT-Tz (Scheme 1) showed that the compound was prepared by means of a two-step process. First, the aldehyde intermediate was prepared in the yield of 52% by Stille coupling between 2-bromo-5-formylthiazole and compound 1, followed by reaction with 1,1-dicyanomethylene-3-indanone via the Knoevenagel condensation reaction to afford the target molecule IDT-Tz in the yield of 60%. Moreover, the small molecule IDT-T was synthesized according to the reported literature.31 These two compounds showed good solubility in common organic solvents such as dichloromethane, chloroform, and chlorobenzene at room temperature. These compounds were characterized using 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR, MALDI-TOF, and elemental analysis.

In order to investigate the difference between the chemical geometry structure and molecular Frontier orbitals of the two molecules IDT-Tz and IDT-T, density functional theory (DFT) calculations at the B3LYP/6-31G(d, p) level were performed for the structures with simplified side chains. As shown in Fig. 1, both small molecules IDT-T and IDT-Tz exhibit highly planar conformations. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) distributions are delocalized along the backbone, and both thiophene and thiazole moieties possess HOMO and LUMO densities, which indicates that replacement of thiophene with thiazole may influence both HOMO and LUMO energy levels. For IDT-Tz, the N⋯S distance of 2.89 Å is within the van der Waals radii (∼3.5 Å), which suggests the existence of noncovalent interactions between nitrogen and sulfur atoms.38,39 Besides, the torsional potentials between the central core and π-bridge units were also computed (see the ESI†). Compared to the IDT-T, IDT-Tz involves a much larger rotational barrier height, which may be ascribed to the weak N⋯S interactions.40 As a result, the thiazole unit can apparently increase the rigidity of the backbone of the IDT-Tz compared to the IDT-T with thiophene as a π-bridge. This could present a useful design rule for increased rigidification in these systems. Moreover, the presence of the thiazole N-atom in IDT-Tz can reduce both HOMO and LUMO energy levels in comparison to IDT-T, which may be more compatible with those of the donor material PTB7-Th (−5.42 eV and −3.81 eV) to ensure efficient exciton dissociation.

The UV-vis absorption spectra of IDT-Tz and IDT-T in chloroform solution and thin solid films are shown in Fig. 2. In solution, the main absorption band of IDT-Tz extends from 480 nm to 750 nm with a maximum absorption peak at 649 nm, which is blue-shifted by ≈30 nm relative to that of IDT-T. Compared to the solution, the absorption spectrum of the IDT-Tz film showed a 50 nm red shift with an absorption onset (λonset) of 808 nm, corresponding to the optical bandgap (Eoptg) of 1.53 eV, which is 0.08 eV higher than that of IDT-T (1.45 eV).

The electrochemical properties of IDT-Tz and IDT-T were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements to study the influence of thiazole units. As shown in Fig. 2, the LUMO energy levels were calculated to be −4.09 eV for IDT-Tz and −3.96 eV for IDT-T. Meanwhile, the HOMO energy levels were calculated to be −5.62 eV for IDT-Tz and −5.41 eV for IDT-T based on HOMO = LUMO − Eoptg. In comparison with IDT-T, both LUMO and HOMO energy levels of IDT-Tz were decreased by 0.13 eV and 0.21 eV, respectively, consistent with the electron deficient properties of the thiazole derivatives. Obviously, the LUMO and HOMO energy levels of IDT-Tz were much lower than those (−5.42 eV and −3.81 eV) of the donor material PTB7-Th to ensure efficient exciton dissociation.
To investigate the photovoltaic performance of the non-fullerene electron acceptors IDT-T and IDT-Tz, OSC devices were fabricated with an inverted structure of ITO/ZnO/active layer/MoO3/Ag, where the active layer consisted of PTB7-Th and IDT-Tz or IDT-T. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves are shown in Fig. 3a and the photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1. After tuning the solvent additive and donor:acceptor weight ratio (D/A), a PCE of 4.08% was achieved for PTB7-Th:IDT-T based devices with a VOC of 0.84 V, a JSC of 9.54 mA cm−2 and a FF of 50.9%, which are comparable to the reported results.31 Upon replacement of IDT-T with IDT-Tz, the PCE was significantly increased to 8.38% with an enhanced JSC (15.94 mA cm−2) and a FF (65.7%), and a reduced VOC (0.80 V). The increased JSC may be attributed to the larger ΔELUMO between PTB7-Th and IDT-Tz, which led to a more efficient exciton dissociation.34 Moreover, the improved FF may be ascribed to the enhanced planarity of the backbone and charge transport mobility. Not surprisingly, the decreased HOMOdonor/LUMOacceptor offset accounted for the slightly decreased VOC. Since IDT-Tz possesses a narrow bandgap of 1.53 eV, a wide bandgap conjugated polymer PBDB-T with a HOMO of −5.21 eV and a LUMO of −3.41 eV was also employed to fabricate the OSC devices. Upon addition of 1.5% 1-chloronaphthalene (CN), a maximum PCE of 8.52% was achieved with a VOC of 0.88 V, a JSC of 13.67 mA cm−2 and a FF of 70.8%. This suggested the versatile applications of IDT-Tz as a non-fullerene acceptor for high-performance OSCs.

The external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves shown in Fig. 3b clarify that the devices have a broad photoresponse range of 350 nm to 800 nm, which is similar to the UV-vis absorption. The EQE peak at 700 nm was improved to 80% from 45% by substituting the thiophene unit with the thiazole unit in the nonfullerene acceptor, and over 70% across the range of 550–750 nm, demonstrating an efficient photoelectron conversion process for the IDT-Tz based device. Meanwhile, the integral short-circuit current densities of IDT-Tz and IDT-T based devices are calculated to be 15.41 mA cm−2 and 9.14 mA cm−2, respectively, which are consistent with the J–V measurements within 5% mismatch.
The bulk charge transport mobility is important for fill factors of solar cells, which are influenced by the planarity of the conjugated backbone and the solid-state packing.32 The electron mobility of the two compounds and the hole and electron mobility of the two blend films were investigated by the space charge limit current (SCLC) method to understand the relationship between the planarity of the backbone and device performance. The hole mobility was measured with a device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/MoO3/Ag, while the electron mobility was characterized with a device structure of ITO/ZnO/active layer/Al. The electron mobilities of IDT-T and IDT-Tz are 0.84 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 1.32 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. Obviously, the IDT-Tz compound exhibits higher mobility. The blend film of PTB7-Th:IDT-T exhibited a hole mobility of 3.10 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and an electron mobility of 0.75 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. Moreover, the blended film PTB7-Th:IDT-Tz exhibited much more balanced electron and hole mobility (μh/μe = 1.44) due to enhanced electron mobility (μe = 2.07 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1), resembling the trend in the pure IDT series, which may be ascribed to the more rigid backbone of IDT-Tz.
Photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the pure donor film and the blend films were measured to investigate the exciton dissociation efficiency. Compared to the pure PTB7-Th film, both blend films exhibit significant PL quenching efficiencies. The PTB7-Th:IDT-Tz blend films result in over 98% fluorescence quenching efficiency at a wavelength of 766 nm, more efficient than that of PTB7-Th:IDT-T blend films (90%). This observation suggested that PTB7-Th:IDT-Tz blend films exhibit more efficient exciton dissociation, reasonably ascribed to the larger ΔELUMO between PTB7-Th:IDT-Tz.
The curves of photocurrent density (Jph) versus effective voltage (Veff) were also measured and analysed to investigate the charge generation and extraction properties.41P(E,T) is determined by normalizing Jph with Jsat (Jph/Jsat), where Jsat stands for saturation photocurrent density.41 Under short current density conditions, a P(E,T) value of 82% was achieved for the IDT-Tz based device, while 83% for the IDT-T based device, indicating that both devices have excellent exciton dissociation and charge collection.
To further study the charge recombination kinetics of the OSC devices, the relationship between JSC values and the light intensity (Plight) was investigated. As shown in Fig. 4a, the relationship between JSC and Plight is described as JSC ∝ Plightα, where the exponent α close to 1.00 means that the charge recombination is negligible.35 The α value of the IDT-Tz based device is 1.00, suggesting that the bimolecular recombination is efficiently suppressed, whereas the IDT-T based device has a relatively stronger bimolecular recombination with an α value of 0.94.
 Fig. 4  (a) JSC and (b) VOCversus light intensity of IDT-T and IDT-Tz based thin films. 

Fig. 4b shows the Plight dependence of VOC, which is a linear relationship with a slope of kT/q. When the slope of VOCversus ln(Plight) is greater than kT/q, it means that the Shockley–Read–Hall (SRH) recombination is involved.42,43 For the IDT-T and IDT-Tz based solar cells, the slope values are 1.33kT/q and 1.14kT/q, respectively, which indicates that more SRH recombination is involved under open circuit conditions in PTB7-Th:IDT-T than PTB7-Th:IDT-Tz. This explains that the bimolecular recombination is the dominant charge recombination mechanism in the PTB7-Th:IDT-Tz blend.
Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were used to study the morphology of the blend films. The AFM height images show quite smooth surfaces with a mean-square surface roughness (Rq) of 1.926 nm for the IDT-Tz based film and 1.283 nm for the IDT-T based film, which indicates that both molecules have good miscibility with PTB7-Th. The Rq of the PTB7-Th:IDT-Tz blend film is greater compared to PTB7-Th:IDT-T blends, which is probably ascribed to the greater crystallinity of the thiazole-based molecule. Besides, the rougher surface may ensure more contact area and stronger interactions between the active layer and the top electrodes, which result in enhanced photovoltaic performance.44 The TEM images showed that the PTB7-Th:IDT-Tz blend film possesses clear phase separation, while the PTB7-Th:IDT-T blend film shows a featureless morphology, which are consistent with the AFM observations (Fig. 5).

Conclusions
In summary, a thiazole unit was introduced as a π-bridge into the backbone of the molecule to replace thiophene, and the influence of the electron deficient moiety of nitrogen and N⋯S intramolecular interactions on optical absorption, energy levels, charge transport mobility, morphologies and photovoltaic properties was systematically investigated. Compared to the thiophene-based molecule IDT-T, the IDT-Tz molecule with multiple fused rings exhibits significantly enhanced photovoltaic performance with an efficiency of 8.38%, twice as high as that of IDT-T. This work not only explores a promising thiazole-based molecular material, but also provides a novel strategy to design high performance non-fullerene acceptors through introducing noncovalent intramolecular conformational locks.
