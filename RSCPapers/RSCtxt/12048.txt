    , Accepted 30th June 2012First published on 19th July 2012AbstractThe structural, mechanical and electrical properties of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) organogels have been probed during the sol–gel transition through combined rheology, AC dielectric spectroscopy and small angle neutron scattering (SANS). SANS shows that structural features of P3HT gels, which are crucial for the optimization of organic photovoltaic devices, evolve throughout the gelation process. In situ structure–property analyses also demonstrate that there are very different mechanisms for the formation and dissolution of fibers and networks prepared from these polymeric semiconductors. It is determined that P3HT gels form conductive pathways that are maintained even after up to 50% of the fibers re-dissolve upon heating. P3HT organogels formed in different aromatic solvents also show differences of more than two orders of magnitude in conductivity despite having similar nanoscale fiber structures. These results demonstrate the importance of controlling the self-assembled morphology of fiber networks for maintaining optimal electronic properties. This work also highlights the potential for using organogels as flexible platforms for designing efficient organic photovoltaic devices.
Introduction
Organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices have the potential to convert abundantly available solar energy into clean, renewable power that could sustain our growing global energy needs.1–5 OPVs are produced using abundant organic materials, are compatible with scalable low-cost manufacturing methods and have highly tunable electronic properties.1,6–8 Still, further improvements in power conversion efficiency (PCE) and in environmental and operational stability are necessary.7–10 To work efficiently OPVs require a composite p-type/n-type semiconductor active layer, usually containing a conjugated polymer and a fullerene derivative, that effectively dissociates excitons and transports charges to produce useful current.3,11 Optimized active layers are often associated with a high p-type/n-type interfacial contact area, the formation of nano-sized domains (<20 nm) and high electrical connectivity or percolation between electrodes.9,12–15 Despite significant advances in efficiency, there is still a need to engineer network structures that can maximize the performance of these devices.4,9,10,16
Traditionally, OPVs are fabricated by dissolving organic p-type and n-type materials in a common solvent and subsequently coating the mixture onto a suitable substrate.3,11,14–17 A variety of post-processing annealing techniques are also utilized to enhance efficiency by increasing the extent of phase segregation and the crystallinity of the individual phases.14,15,18 Still, the structures that are formed are usually kinetically stabilized and continue to evolve with time leading to gradually declining performance.19,20 In an alternative approach, self-assembly of the organic components prior to coating can be used as a platform to generate stable and structurally optimized network structures.21,22 Many conjugated polymers self-assemble into interconnected network structures that could be ideal for active layers in OPVs.23–27
To date, polymer gelation has been largely regarded as a negative attribute for OPV fabrication because of difficulties that arise during processing as a result of the increased elasticity.21,28 Recent advances in device fabrication have shown that it is still possible to process conjugated polymer organogels while maintaining their structural features.29–31 These advancements in processing open the door to pursue gelation as a flexible platform to design the photoactive layer of OPVs. Many conjugated polymers (P3ATs, PFO, MEH-PPV, etc.) form gels at moderate concentrations (>10 mg mL−1) in organic solvents.23–30,32–37 The gel phase of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT), in particular, has been shown to have much higher conductivities when compared to films generated using traditional coating processes.25,35 Conjugated polymer organogels have also been used to produce functional OPV devices by back-filling the porous network structure with an n-type fullerene.29,31 Furthermore, the structure and properties of P3HT organogels can be tuned based on changes to self-assembly conditions.35–37 Yet, to further engineer the network structure of organogels there must be a robust understanding of the self-assembly processes occurring in these systems. Despite recent advances, little is known about how the structure of conjugated polymers evolves during gelation.
Common techniques for evaluating structure in conjugated polymer gels are transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), small angle neutron scattering (SANS) and small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS).15,29,30,32,34–38 Small angle scattering has important advantages because the bulk morphology of the gel can be probed in situ during the self-assembly process, over multiple length scales and without any sample manipulation. Still, most SAXS and SANS studies have been limited to probing equilibrium states in these materials. Here we combine three complementary experimental techniques to simultaneously probe structure and property development occurring during the sol–gel transition in P3HT organogels. Fig. 1 shows the three experimental setups that allow for direct correlation of structural, mechanical and electrical properties of developing gels. Dielectric-SANS allows for simultaneous probing of the developing structure and electrical properties. Rheology-SANS allows us to simultaneously probe the structural and mechanical properties. Finally, dielectric-rheology provides a direct link between the developing mechanical and electrical properties. This work contributes a detailed understanding of P3HT self-assembly and also demonstrates the great potential to engineer network structures specifically for OPV or other applications involving organic semiconductors.

Experimental methods
Materials
Sepiolid P200 poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT, Lot# 22.10.2009) was used as received from Rieke Metals (Lincoln, NE). The weight-averaged molecular weight (Mw) and polydispersity index (PDI) were characterized by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) and determined to be 16770 g mol−1 and 1.6, relative to polystyrene standards. The regioregularity of the polymer was reported by the manufacturer to be greater than 98%. Hydrogenated solvents (p-xylene, toluene and benzene) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO) and used as received. Deuterated solvents were utilized to decrease the incoherent scattering background and increase the scattering contrast for SANS experiments. D10-p-xylene (D > 98%), D8-toluene (D > 99.5%), and D6-benzene (D > 99.5%) were purchased from Cambridge Isotopes (Andover, MA) and used as received.
Sample preparation
Samples were prepared by adding 30 ± 0.3 mg mL−1 P3HT to p-xylene, toluene or benzene and then heating to 80 °C for 10 minutes or more to fully dissolve the polymer prior to loading in various experimental setups. The polymer is considered fully dissolved when the solution is bright orange and there are no visible signs of solid polymer (black).
Scanning transmission electron microscopy
A small quantity of fully developed (>2 days) 10 mg mL−1 P3HT organogel formed in toluene was transferred to a copper TEM grid with a Formvar support film by briefly placing the grid in contact with the surface of the gel sample without applying pressure.35 In this way, only a thin-film of organogel was transferred to the TEM grid. Due to the very thin nature of the sample, the toluene evaporated nearly instantaneously under ambient conditions. TEM images were obtained with a FEI Tecnai G2 F20 transmission electron microscope operating at 120 kV in scanning TEM (sTEM) mode.
Dielectric-SANS
Simultaneous AC dielectric spectroscopy and SANS (dielectric-SANS) measurements were performed in the CG2 beam-line at the High Flux Isotope Reactor (HFIR) at Oak Ridge National Lab (Oak Ridge, TN). The AC dielectric spectroscopy, used to measure the AC conductivity, was performed at a frequency of 2 kHz with a perturbation voltage of 200 mV that was determined to be in the linear impedance response region (Fig. S1, ESI†). All dielectric measurements were performed with an Agilent e4980a Precision LCR meter.
SANS measurements were performed at two detector distances to cover a broad q-range (0.002 < q (Å−1) < 0.2). The newly designed sample environment includes an electrically isolated demountable sample cell (polyether ether ketone) with a 2 mm pathlength and polished aluminum windows (Fig. 1). The hot polymer solution (80 °C) was loaded into the room temperature sample cell, sealed and then re-heated to 80 °C to ensure full dissolution of the polymer. Temperature control was maintained by using a Peltier heating block and the accuracy was monitored by a placing a j-type thermocouple into an identical sample cell filled with ethylene glycol. The cooling ramp rate was 0.8 °C min−1 while the heating ramp rate was 1.2 °C min−1. The scattering curves were referenced to the incident beam flux and set in an absolute scale. Corrections for transmission, background and empty cell scattering were also applied using standard methods.39 The scaling procedure was confirmed by measuring the absolute scattering cross-section of D2O and H2O and comparing to known values.40 The 2D scattering profiles were converted to 1D profiles for data fitting and the results were matched point-by-point to the AC conductivity data. Model fitting was performed using the DANSE SansView software.41
The AC conductivity values were normalized because variations in surface resistivity of the polished aluminum windows caused fluctuations in the absolute value of the conductivity. Still, the trends and the shape of the normalized curves were identical between runs and matched dielectric-rheology experiments that were performed with non-corrosive stainless steel electrodes (Fig. S6, ESI†).
Rheology-SANS
Simultaneous oscillatory rheology and SANS (rheology-SANS) experiments were performed in the NG7 beam-line at NIST Center for Neutron Research (NCNR) at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (Gaithersburg, MD).42 Experiments were performed using an Anton Paar Physica MCR 501 rheometer with a titanium concentric cylinder geometry (gap = 0.5 mm, diameter = 29 mm, height = 36 mm) at a frequency of 1 Hz.43 The applied strain was 1% at high temperature (>40 °C), but reduced to 0.25% just prior to the gelation temperature in each respective solvent to avoid breaking the gels. The strain of 0.25% is well below the experimentally determined linear viscoelastic limit (∼0.5%). A plot of the modulus as a function of temperature for a gel probed with different frequencies and strains is also included in Fig. S7 of the ESI† to assess reproducibility. A solvent trap filled with a non-volatile, low viscosity silicone oil was utilized to prevent evaporation. After loading the hot (80 °C) P3HT solution, the samples were re-heated to 80 °C to ensure the polymer remained fully dissolved prior to experimentation. The heating and cooling ramp rate for the rheology-SANS experiments was 0.8 °C min−1.
SANS measurements were performed at two detector distances to provide a wide q-range for fitting (0.002 < q (Å−1) < 0.2), except for samples in benzene that were measured with a smaller q-range (0.0131 < q (Å−1) < 0.2) due to time constraints. The total scattering path length was 1 mm and the scattering was scaled by the empty beam flux and corrected for background and empty cell scattering.39 This also allowed for direct point-by-point matching of the rheology and SANS data. The 1D SANS profiles were fit to models using the DANSE SansView software.41
Dielectric-rheology
Simultaneous AC dielectric spectroscopy and rheology (dielectric-rheology) measurements were performed using an Anton Paar Physica MCR 301 rheometer and an Agilent e4980a Precision LCR meter. A parallel plate geometry, with ceramic shaft insert for electrical isolation, with a 25 mm diameter and 0.4 mm gap was pre-heated to 40 °C prior to loading the hot polymer solution (80 °C).35 Once loaded, the solution was rapidly cooled to induce gelation. After the solution had solidified (∼1 minute) a fluorinated non-conductive oleophobic liquid (Fomblin Y 25/6) was added to the outer edge of the sample geometry to fully suppress the evaporation of the organic solvent. We have experimentally confirmed that the addition of Fomblin does not impact the rheology or conductivity of P3HT organogels.35 The gel was then re-heated to 80 °C for 5 minutes to completely re-dissolve the gel before the experiments were performed. Small amplitude oscillatory strain measurements (γ = 0.25% and f = 1 Hz) were used to track changes in mechanical properties during gelation.
Simultaneous AC conductivity measurements are possible through the use of a special rheometer cell designed for simultaneous dielectric measurements. This cell is electrically isolated from the frame and the electronics of the rheometer. Electrical contact is created between a gold wire and the upper tool geometry (stainless steel) and also from the bottom tool (stainless steel) seen in Fig. 1. The conductivity and other electrical properties are then measured across the sample gap with the parallel plates of the rheometer also acting as parallel electrodes. The use of stainless steel plates ensures that corrosion does not impact the electrical measurements. The torque created by the constant frictional resistance of the gold lead wire on the upper tool geometry leads to a constant background modulus that we have described in a recent publication.35 AC conductivity measurements are made at a frequency of 2 kHz and a perturbation voltage of 600 mV, which is still within the linear response region (Fig. S1, ESI†). The cooling and heating ramp rate utilized for these experiments was 0.8 °C min−1.
Results and discussion
Small angle neutron scattering analysis
Tuning the self-assembly of conjugated polymer gels represents an opportunity to engineer structures with features that are desirable for maximizing the efficiency of OPVs. It has been established that the morphology of gels made from self-assembling polymers and small molecules can be engineered by adjusting the self-assembly conditions (solvent, temperature, etc.).44–47 Designing specific gel structures requires an understanding of the driving forces behind self-assembly as well as the progression of structural intermediates.44,46,48 The latter can be difficult to probe because studying the progression of self-assembly requires non-invasive techniques that can probe evolving structures over all relevant length-scales. Small angle scattering is an ideal technique for this and is employed here to probe self-assembling P3HT organogels.
Fitting of SANS profiles is performed by accounting for all scattering objects at variable volume fractions while obeying conservation of mass. All P3HT samples are analyzed as three-component systems of solvent, dissolved polymer chains and fibers with rectangular cross-section. We use a combined model that includes a parallelepiped form factor for the fibers and a form factor for polymer chains with excluded volume interactions for the dissolved polymer.35,49–51 The combined model applies a mass balance on P3HT that is bound by the known total volume fraction of P3HT in the original solution (ϕv), to determine the cross-sectional dimensions of the fiber (a and b) and to account for the fraction of P3HT that exists in fiber form (ψf) at any instant. These are the only three adjustable parameters that are allowed to vary during the least-squares fitting routine. Eqn (1) describes the scattering intensity (I) as a function of the scattering vector (q) I(q) = ϕvψf(ΔρPP)2PPP(q) + ϕv(1 − ψf)(ΔρPExV)2PPExV(q)(1)where ΔρPP is the scattering contrast between P3HT fibers and solvent, ΔρPExV is the scattering contrast between dissolved P3HT chains and solvent, PPP(q) is the parallelepiped form factor and PPExV(q) is the form factor for polymer chains with excluded volume interactions.
The parallelepiped form factor represents the shape of semi-crystalline P3HT fibers and has three fitting variables:38,50 (2)In eqn (2): a, b and c are the fiber thickness, width and length respectively. The fiber length (c) is expected to be much larger than the q-range probed in these experiments and the parallelepiped model is insensitive to this dimension over the relevant q-range that was fit (0.01 < q (Å−1) < 0.25).
The form factor for polymers with excluded volume interactions (PPExV) accounts for dissolved P3HT chains that coexist with the P3HT fibers and are even present in fully developed gels:35,38 (3)here, n is the number of segments, a is the statistical segment length and ν is related to conformation of the polymer chain. In order to reduce the number of fitting parameters in the combined model (eqn (1)), we fit data from fully dissolved P3HT chains at elevated temperatures (40 < T (°C) < 80) and use the same parameters for the rest of the data. The SANS profiles and the fit parameters for the dissolved polymers are found to be constant over a wide temperature range (40–80 °C) until fiber formation is evident in the data. From the fits, ν was determined to be 0.7 ± 0.04, which is between the value for rod-like chains (ν = 1) and for Gaussian coils (ν = 0.5). This result is expected because conjugated polymer chains tend to be rigid in solution.49,51 The radius of gyration (Rg) was also calculated, using eqn (4), and confirmed with a Guinier fit, to be 53 ± 4 Å across all solvents.51 (4)
The weight-averaged molecular weight (Mw) of the polymer was also determined from SANS of fully dissolved P3HT and was determined to be 8500 ± 750 g mol−1 (ref. 52). This highlights the overestimation of Mw values for rigid conjugated polymers that results from the calibration of GPC measurements with flexible polystyrene standards (Mw = 16770 g mol−1).53 The details of the SANS molecular weight determination can be found in the ESI† section.
The scattering length density (SLD) for P3HT fibers was previously found to be (1.07 ± 0.10) × 10−6 Å−1.35 From this, it was determined that approximately 11 volume% of the P3HT fibers corresponded to entrained solvent that is distributed throughout the fiber. This contributes to an increased SLD over that of individual P3HT chains which is calculated from the density and atomic composition to be 0.676 × 10−6 Å−1.54,55 The scattering length density of each solvent is also calculated from the molecular formula and density, which is a function of temperature. The SLD is presented as a function of temperature for each solvent in the ESI (Fig. S2†).
By fixing most variables in eqn (1) to known or independently measured values, only three parameters remain unknown in the combined model: fiber thickness (a), width (b) and fraction of P3HT in fiber form (ψf). This leads to rigorous fitting as shown in Fig. 2 so that detailed structural values can be extracted with high confidence (Table 1).

The scattering in Fig. 2 provides structural information over a wide range of length scales (∼1 nm to 300 nm). The combined model is only valid over a limited q-range (q > 0.01 Å¬1). At lower-q (<0.01 Å−1), there is an increase in the scattering intensity relative to the expected scattering for discrete fibers. This corresponds to the formation of a branched network structure that is better modeled as a mass fractal.35,38 A fractal dimension (DSf) characterizing this structure can be extracted from the dependence  at low angles (q < 0.008 Å−1) and results are also included in Table 1.
The specific surface area (Sv) for the fibers is calculated using the Porod equation: (5)where Σ is the surface area per volume in units of m−1 that can be converted to specific surface area (Sv) in units of m2 g−1 using the following equation: (6)where ρmP3HT is the mass density of P3HT (1.1 g cm−3) and ϕfiber is the volume fraction of fibers in solution. The scattering invariant (Q) can be utilized to determine fiber volume fractions (ϕfiber) when calculating the specific surface area.31,35 The volume fraction of fibers can also be determined from model fitting, where ϕfiber = ϕvψf, and the difference between these independent methods is less than 10%. Herein, the scattering invariant is utilized for all Sv calculations.
The Porod analysis requires that the system is composed of two phases (i.e. solvent and fibers) with a sharp interface that results in an intensity dependence of I(q) ∝ q−4 at high-q. At the intermediate stages of gelation, the amount of dissolved polymer is not negligible and it contributes significantly to the scattering intensity at high-q. In order to calculate the specific surface area, the scattering from the fibers and the dissolved polymer must first be separated. After subtracting the scattering corresponding to the fraction of dissolved polymer (obtained through model fitting), a perfect q−4 dependence is found for the scattering profile corresponding to the fibers (Fig. S3, ESI†). Unfortunately, the subtraction of the dissolved polymer contribution at very low fiber concentrations (ψf < 3%) is not possible because the fibers do not fully dominate the scattering intensity and this leads to high uncertainty in the resulting scattering signal. Additional details about the Sv calculation are found in the ESI.†
Dielectric-SANS and rheology-SANS results
By combining small angle scattering with rheology and conductivity measurements it is possible to simultaneously study the developing structure and properties of the organogels. Rheology-SANS measurements allow for simultaneous monitoring of changes in fiber dimensions (a and b), fraction of P3HT in fiber form (ψf), network fractal dimension (DSf), specific surface area (Sv), elastic modulus (G′) and viscous modulus (G′′) as a function of temperature. These rheological measurements provide critical information about the development of the network structure, such as the gel point (G′ = G′′) and the overall stiffness of the fiber networks.
It has been demonstrated that P3HT undergoes a substantial increase in conductivity with gelation.25,35 Here we perform dielectric-SANS measurements that allow structural parameters to be directly correlated with the development of electronic properties in the conductive fiber networks. The rheology-SANS and dielectric-SANS experiments are performed with identical cooling (i.e. gelation) rates of 0.8 °C min−1 and with very similar re-heating (i.e. dissolution) rates of 0.8 °C min−1 and 1.2 °C min−1 for rheology-SANS and dielectric-SANS, respectively. This allows for direct comparison of the evolution of structural, mechanical and electronic properties.

Fig. 3 shows the development of morphological features in conjunction with the moduli (G′ and G′′) and electrical conductivity normalized to its maximum value (σNorm). The structural parameters presented in Fig. 3 represent point-by-point averages of fitting results from SANS profiles obtained during separate rheology-SANS and dielectric-SANS experiments on identical samples. Reproducibility and consistency between fitting results is demonstrated by the relatively small standard deviation values (error bars).
 Fig. 3  Results of dielectric-SANS and rheology-SANS experiments for 30 mg mL−1 P3HT organogels in aromatic solvents (benzene, toluene and p-xylene). Blue markers represent the cooling ramp (gelation) and red markers represent re-heating (dissolution). Conductivity data (σNorm) shows two sequential cycles to compare reproducibility. G′ corresponds to the elastic modulus, G′′ corresponds to the loss modulus, ψf corresponds to the fraction of P3HT in fiber form, DSf corresponds to the network fractal dimension and Sv corresponds to the fiber specific surface area. Error bars represent the standard deviation of the rheology-SANS and dielectric-SANS fitting results. 
Complementary dielectric-SANS and rheology-SANS experiments provide a wealth of structure–property information during the intermediate (i.e. non-equilibrium) stages of gelation. The gelation temperature (Tgel) is determined from the crossover of the elastic and viscous modulus (G′ = G′′). P3HT shows differences in gelation temperature depending on the solvent: p-xylene (Tgel = 34 °C), toluene (Tgel = 26 °C) and benzene (Tgel = 26 °C). All gels also show differences in their maximum moduli at low temperature. Even toluene and benzene samples, which gel at the same temperature, have different final moduli (G′Tol = 11.8 kPa, G′Ben = 74.4 kPa) suggesting that there are differences in the gel structure. Rheological frequency sweeps of the samples confirm that P3HT is a gel over a wide range of frequencies regardless of the solvent used (seen in Fig. S4, ESI†).

Fig. 3 shows that, after percolation, ψf values increase during the entire cooling cycle. The continued increase in ψf and G′ indicates that new fibers continue to form over the course of gelation. However, we also find that an increase in the total fraction of P3HT in fiber form does not necessarily contribute to further increases in the conductivity (σNorm) of the network. A similar result was observed for the isothermal gelation of P3HT, where an increasing mechanical elasticity did not always correlate with increased conductivity.35 This was determined to be the result of fibers that form at later stages of gelation but may not contribute to further electrical percolation. These fibers may correspond to dangling ends or “hairs” that could contribute to mechanical elasticity but do not branch or bridge the electrodes to increase the conductivity. Fig. 4 (left) shows a representation of how fiber formation leads to P3HT gelation and percolation.
 Fig. 4  The development and re-dissolution of the fibrillar P3HT organogel structure (left). The self-assembly and break-up of individual P3HT fibers that occurs as a function of temperature (right). 

Fig. 3 also shows that fiber thickness (a) increases for P3HT in all solvents, fiber width (b) decreases for p-xylene and toluene samples, and the specific surface area (Sv) decreases to varying degrees for all solvents during the cooling ramp (gelation). The specific surface area is primarily determined by the cross-sectional dimensions of the growing fibers. The smallest dimension, which in this case is the fiber thickness, is the primary contributor to changes in specific surface area because it is ∼5 times smaller than the fiber width. (7)
The change in Sv during gelation is especially pronounced in benzene because the fiber thickness changes significantly while the width is approximately constant throughout gelation. Additionally, gels formed in benzene have a lower Sv because of the substantially thicker fibers when compared to those formed in p-xylene or toluene.35 Regardless of the changes between solvents, all gels show high values of specific surface area that are desirable for efficient charge separation in bulk-heterojunction OPV devices.
These results suggest that P3HT in p-xylene, toluene and benzene form thin fibers initially that continue to thicken over time as gelation proceeds. Therefore, increased ψf values likely result from both an increasing cross-sectional size and also from the formation of new fibers. The increase in fiber thickness may provide an explanation for why the development of ψf at lower temperatures does not contribute significantly to further increasing the bulk conductivity. This finding may also explain why Huang and coworkers find that beyond 2 hours, further gelation of P3HT does not contribute to increased OPV device efficiency.56 New fibers are more likely to increase the percolation between electrodes while thicker fibers may still have similar conductivity values when compared to slightly thinner fibers. A new mechanism for fiber growth is proposed in Fig. 4 (right) where dissolved polymer chains join fibers at any point and contribute to increasing its thickness.
Interestingly, the steady state width of the fibers in all solvents is close to 22 ± 3 nm, which is very similar to the contour length (20 ± 2 nm) of the polymer chain as determined from the molecular weight measured by SANS and from the length (3.85 nm) and weight (166.3 g mol−1) of the monomer units.57 This suggests that individual polymer chains could be stacking perpendicular to the fiber axis in an extended conformation and that self-folding of polymer chains within the fiber structure is not necessary.58 For P3HT samples in p-xylene and toluene, the small but observable change in fiber width during gelation (Fig. 3) could be due to the biased self-assembly of larger polymer chains first. Yet, this behavior is not seen in samples that gel in benzene. It should be noted that this work was limited to relatively low molecular weight polymer and studies of higher molecular weight polymer fibers have found that the fiber width is insensitive to adjustable parameters including solvent and temperature.59
The network fractal dimension (DSf) characterizes the homogeneity and fiber density of the bulk gel.35 At fiber fractions just above mechanical and electrical percolation (ψf > 0.03) DSf is found to be fairly constant. Also, we never observe the I(q) ∝ q−1 dependence that would indicate rigid isolated fibers forming in dispersion. Instead, all scattering profiles containing fibers show values of DSf ∼ 1.5 that are characteristic of branching networks. Fiber branching has also been demonstrated for P3HT fibers that self-assemble in dilute solutions.38,60
In order to compare the development of properties in different solvents it is informative to compare values at equivalent fractions of P3HT in fiber form (ψf = 0.20). The development of G′ and σ in each solvent, relative to the values for gels at the end of the cooling cycle, is dramatically different. For p-xylene, toluene and benzene gels the conductivity has developed to 80%, 65% and 50% of the value measured at the end of the cooling cycle. In contrast, for p-xylene, toluene and benzene gels G′ had only developed to 20%, 15% and 5% of the maximum value at the same instant. This suggests that the conductive network structure develops much more rapidly than the mechanical components of the gel. Furthermore, it shows that there are significant differences in the development of gels in different solvents.

Fig. 5 (left) highlights the fraction of P3HT in fiber form, as well as the mechanical and electrical properties, around the percolation threshold. For all solvents, electrical and the mechanical percolation occur simultaneously and are correlated with the first signs of fiber formation. The percolation threshold is determined to occur at fiber volume fractions (ϕfiber = ϕvψf) that are lower than 0.001 in all solvents. Though the intrinsic conductivity of P3HT fibers is lower than many other organic conductive materials, the percolation threshold is still incredibly low. Similar volume fractions are observed for the ultra-low percolation of well-dispersed carbon nanotubes within an epoxy matrix (∼0.0005).61,62
 Fig. 5  Fraction of P3HT in fiber form (ψf), normalized elastic modulus (G′Norm) and normalized conductivity (σNorm) measured simultaneously during rheology-SANS and dielectric-SANS for 30 mg mL−1 P3HT organogel right at the point of initial percolation (left) and re-dissolution (right) in different solvents. Dashed horizontal lines (left) indicate the minimum value of ψf that is precisely resolvable from SANS data. 
Unfortunately, the exact value for the percolation volume fraction in each solvent could not be calculated for comparison. The SANS model loses sensitivity at extremely low fiber concentrations (ψf < 0.03) due to the decreasing scattering signal and because of this, the fraction of P3HT in fiber form cannot be determined with the necessary degree of accuracy. We can only conclusively say that percolation in all solvents occurs at very low fractions of P3HT in fiber form (upper bound of ψf ∼ 0.03) and that this corresponds to a percolation threshold at fiber volume fractions (ϕfiber) of less than 0.001. Nevertheless, between 0 < ψf < 0.03 there is a clear increase in scattering intensity at low values of q indicating that the fiber fraction is rapidly increasing and the percolation threshold could be even lower.

Fig. 5 (right) also provides a closer look at the mechanical and electrical properties, in conjunction with the fraction of P3HT in fiber form, during re-heating to highlight the organogel dissolution behavior. Upon re-heating, the fraction of P3HT in fiber form slightly increases or remains constant during the initial stages of re-heating. As the temperature continues to increase, eventually ψf decreases until the gels fully dissolve at high temperatures (Fig. 3). The re-dissolution temperature was determined to be 52 °C, 58 °C and 70 °C, for gels in benzene, toluene and p-xylene, respectively. The elastic modulus decreases simultaneously with the fraction of P3HT in fiber form over most temperatures. In contrast, the conductivity continues to increase, even after ψf and G′ have decreased substantially below their maximum values. An increase in conductivity is expected for increasing temperature in semiconductors.63,64 However, it is very interesting that, for organogels in all solvents, ψf decreases significantly (30–50%) before the conductivity even begins to decrease.
For gels formed in p-xylene and toluene, the fiber dimensions (width and thickness) remain constant during the re-heating cycle. Only gels formed in benzene show a decrease in fiber thickness just prior to dissolution. The large thermal hysteresis in the fiber fraction, fiber dimensions, mechanical properties and electrical properties suggest that organogel formation and dissolution differ significantly. Dissolution from within a fiber is likely a cooperative process where multiple chains must loosen their intermolecular interactions in order to break free from the ends of fractured fibers, as seen in Fig. 4 (right). During gelation, individual polymer chains can easily crystallize and join growing fibers. In contrast, fiber breakup requires the cooperative dissolution of all the chains within a fiber segment. This dissolution process results in electrical and mechanical contacts being maintained until the fiber cross-section is fully broken. This simple mechanism can explain the large thermal hysteresis observed in the structural, mechanical and electrical properties of conjugated polymer organogels.
Dielectric-rheology measurements correlating mechanical and electrical properties
The changes in conductivity for organic semiconductors with respect to increasing temperature is shown to follow an Arrhenius behavior (Fig. 6):35,64 σ = Ae−EA/kbT(8)where A is a constant, EA is the activation energy, kb is Boltzmann's constant and T is the temperature during re-heating. One fundamental assumption for fitting conductivity data with the Arrhenius equation is that the structure should be constant during the measurement. In order to ensure a constant structure, the Arrhenius equation was only used at low re-heating temperatures. We know that, upon re-heating, the structure and the fraction of P3HT in fiber form remains fairly constant (Fig. 3) up to 25 °C in benzene, 35 °C in toluene and 40 °C in p-xylene. This means that the Arrhenius dependence is expected to break down or change at these higher temperatures.
 Fig. 6  Arrhenius plots for 30 mg mL−1 P3HT organogels in different solvents during re-heating and dissolution. Solid lines correspond to fits to eqn (8) at low temperatures that are extended beyond the fit to highlight the deviation. The dashed vertical lines highlight the temperature at which the Arrhenius response deviates from the sample response. The conductivity, σ, has units of units of S m−1. 
The trend in activation energy is similar to the trend in conductivity. Gels formed in p-xylene, toluene and benzene have activation energy values of 210 meV, 450 meV and 580 meV respectively. Interestingly, the initial Arrhenius behavior of each gel breaks down at 24 °C, 23 °C and 13 °C for p-xylene, toluene and benzene respectively. These temperatures are all significantly lower than those where any structural changes are observed from SANS measurements. This indicates that another process must also be involved in the modification of the initial Arrhenius dependence.

Fig. 7a highlights the unique interplay between mechanical and electrical properties upon re-heating. As the temperature is raised, the elastic modulus (G′) of P3HT gels in all solvents initially increases and then rapidly decreases. In contrast, the conductivity continues to increase even after the viscous and elastic moduli have reached similar values (i.e. no longer a gel). The initial increase in elastic modulus is likely due to the continued self-assembly of free polymer chains, resulting in increasing fiber thickness or the formation of new fibers altogether. Interestingly, there is a peak in the loss modulus (G′′), 23 °C for toluene and 24 °C for p-xylene, that does not correspond to any specific changes in the elastic modulus (G′). For example, G′ is increasing for p-xylene samples and decreasing for toluene samples. This result is in contrast to P3HT gels formed in benzene, which show a relatively constant loss modulus during re-heating. The peak in loss modulus also occurs near the temperature where the Arrhenius behavior is found to break down for each gel, which indicates that there may be a transition that affects both the mechanical and electronic properties of the material around these temperatures. Physically, this behavior may suggest a transition from a rigid crystalline state to one with increased thermal fluctuation of polymer chains located within the fibers. These fluctuations could decrease the overall stiffness of the fibers and also affect the electronic properties. Eventually, these fluctuations are likely the origin of fiber breakup and dissolution.

The trend in conductivity for organogels formed in different solvents is also verified when evaluating the DC conductivity through linear impedance analysis (Fig. 7b). This analysis allows for the direct calculation of the resistance (Rp) associated with the dielectric behavior of the bulk organogel without the potential interference of resistances due to charge injection at the electrodes or due to other interfacial effects. From this analysis, the DC conductivities of the gels are determined to be 5.0 μS m−1, 0.7 μS m−1 and 13 nS m−1 for p-xylene, toluene and benzene, respectively. These values are within the same order of magnitude as the AC conductivity measurements and also show the same trend as the activation energy. This result further demonstrates that it is possible to tune the electronic properties of organogels by adjusting self-assembly conditions. Additional details related to this analysis can be found in the ESI† section.65,66
It is clear that even with similar fiber fractions and cross-sectional dimensions, drastically different mechanical and electrical properties are achieved during the gelation of P3HT in different solvents. We have previously shown P3HT to exhibit different degrees of fiber branching that cause differences in conductivity.35 The results presented here also demonstrate differences in conductivity of more than two orders of magnitude when comparing p-xylene (most conductive) and benzene (least conductive) gels. Since nanoscale features of individual fibers remain fairly constant between solvents, these property changes are likely the result of changes in the branching network structure. Understanding the structural and mechanical features that contribute to electronic property enhancements is critical for the engineering of gel structures that are designed specifically for OPV applications. These results show significant promise towards this end.
To complement and validate all of these structure–property experiments, dielectric-rheology is also performed (shown in Fig. 6 and 7) using cooling and heating ramps that are similar to rheology-SANS and dielectric-SANS experiments (0.8 °C min−1). As expected, it is found that there is very good agreement in the rheology from the dielectric-rheology and rheology-SANS experiments (Fig. S5, ESI†), despite the different geometries that are used (concentric cylinder and parallel plate fixtures). The only significant difference is observed in the moduli of the samples when they are fully dissolved. This is the result of the friction caused by the wire that is utilized to collect simultaneous electrical measurements (Fig. 1). Furthermore, there is very good agreement between the shapes and transition temperatures for the normalized dielectric-SANS and dielectric-rheology measurements (Fig. S6, ESI†). The consistency between measurement techniques further demonstrates that the combination of complementary rheology-SANS, dielectric-SANS and dielectric-rheology measurements allows for a rigorous analysis of structural–mechanical–electrical property relationships of developing P3HT organogels.
Conclusion
Rheology-SANS, dielectric-SANS and dielectric-rheology measurements provide a robust understanding of the thermoreversible gelation and re-dissolution of P3HT in different solvents. We demonstrate that mechanical and electrical percolation occurs nearly instantaneously with the development of fibers. The percolation threshold for these gels is found to be lower than ∼0.001 volume fraction. The large thermal hysteresis and the lack of structural changes in fibers during gel dissolution suggest that there is a very different mechanism for fiber break-up than for formation. We propose that the breakup mechanism is a thermally activated cooperative process that causes a large hysteresis in the development of properties and structural features during cooling and heating of the samples. We also find that a conductive fiber network structure persists well after a significant fraction of the gel has re-dissolved. Finally, we observe a more than two order of magnitude difference in conductivity values for P3HT organogels formed in different organic solvents. The similarity in nanoscale structural features between these gels suggests that the network structure plays a critical role in the determination of charge transport efficiency within gels. These results further demonstrate that organogels incorporated into OPV photoactive layers would provide an excellent platform for achieving high interfacial area materials with tunable electronic properties.
