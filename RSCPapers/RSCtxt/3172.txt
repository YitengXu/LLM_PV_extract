    , Accepted 17th May 2019First published on 20th May 2019AbstractA robust electrocatalyst based on single iron atoms was developed for CO2 reduction with a high faradaic efficiency over 99.6%. The cathodic CO2 reduction was then coupled with anodic production of hypochlorite, and high energy efficiency (82%) with nearly 100% atom economy could be achieved in this model electrolysis system.
Electrochemical reduction of CO2 is a potentially mild and green strategy to convert waste CO2 into valuable chemicals and fuels with the use of renewable electricity.1–8 In the traditional electrolytic process, CO2 reduction takes place on the cathode, while the anode reaction is the oxidation of water. The anodic product of oxygen is normally released into air due to its little economic value, so applied electricity is only utilized to produce value-added cathodic products. Up to now, most articles have focused on the anodic oxidation of water to oxygen,9–11 and few papers have reported the utilization of anodic reaction in the treatment of pollutants of wastewater.12 In comparison, little attention has been paid to the generation of valuable products on the anode. If an anodic reaction could be coupled with CO2 reduction and valuable products are also generated on the anode, the electrical energy would be consumed efficiently. However, this idea is challenged by the matching of the anodic reaction with cationic CO2 reduction and the electrolytes suitable for both anodic and cationic reactions.
The well-known anodic electrolysis of NaCl solution possesses advantages of mild reaction conditions and cheap raw materials and produces hypochlorite as a popular chemical used in many fields such as bleaching and industrial waste treatment.13,14–16 Obviously, the ambient working condition of this anodic reaction is compatible with that of CO2 reduction. More importantly, the same salt electrolyte could be used for both anodic and cathodic reactions. Therefore, it is theoretically feasible to combine the anodic electrolysis of salt solution with cathodic CO2 reduction, which has almost never been investigated previously.
Highly efficient coupling of cathodic CO2 reduction and anodic NaCl oxidation lies in the improvement of faradaic efficiency and the reduction of overpotential at the same time, depending on the development of low-cost and high-performance electrocatalysts. Particularly in the case of NaCl aqueous solution as the electrolyte, the catalysts must work well in a CO2-saturated NaCl aqueous solution of pH = ∼4.5. In such a weak-acidic environment, a side reaction of hydrogen evolution (2H+ + 2e− → H2) would easily take place, decreasing the faradaic efficiency of CO2 conversion. Unfortunately, most studies in the literature have reported that CO2 reduction catalysts worked in weak-alkaline bicarbonate electrolytes (pH = ∼7.8) to suppress hydrogen evolution and achieve high faradaic efficiencies.17 Obviously, it is a great challenge to realize highly efficient coupling of cathodic CO2 reduction and anodic NaCl oxidation for simultaneous production of CO and NaClO from CO2 and NaCl.
In this work, we demonstrate that single iron atoms loaded on nitrogen-doped carbon (Fe-SAs/N–C) are a robust and excellent electrocatalyst to couple the cathodic CO2 reduction and the anodic NaCl oxidation with a ruthenium oxide coated titanium (RuO2/Ti) anode. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations are employed to understand the reaction mechanism and the roles of isolated iron atoms coordinated by four N atoms. The faradaic efficiency of conversion of CO2 to CO and the energy efficiency of the total reaction are recorded.
The Fe-SAs/N–C catalyst was synthesized by a heat-treatment strategy with the use of an Fe modified MOF as a precursor. The as-synthesized catalyst, single iron atoms supported on a nitrogen doped carbon substrate, was labeled as Fe-SAs/N–C. Its morphology was then observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM). The SEM and TEM results show that the Fe-SAs/N–C sample consists of nanoparticles in a uniform rhombododecahedral shape (Fig. 1a). The elements C, N, and Fe are homogeneously distributed throughout the whole architecture, as revealed by elemental mapping (Fig. 1b). Further aberration-corrected HAADF-STEM analysis provided definite proof for the existence of single atomic iron. Images in Fig. 1c and d reveal that the Fe atoms are dominantly dispersed on the carbon support in the status of a single atom. The Fe content in the catalyst was found to be 1.08 wt% by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) analysis. The synthesized materials were also characterized using powder X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) patterns. As illustrated by the peaks of the Fe-SAs/N–C sample in Fig. S1,† there is a broad shoulder peak in the range of 20–30°, which can be indexed to graphitic carbon formed from the high temperature calcination of the organic precursor. In comparison with the XRD result of the N–C sample, there is no obvious XRD signal from the iron species due to the low concentration and high dispersion of iron.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was further used to investigate the binding states of C and N in the sample. The C 1s spectrum reveals that the sample consists of three types of carbon species, which are identified as CC (283.5 eV), CN (284.4 eV), and C–N (287.6 eV) (Fig. 2a). The N 1s XPS spectrum can be deconvoluted into three main peaks at 402.4, 399.8 and 397.4 eV (Fig. 2b), corresponding to graphitic-N, pyrrolic-N and pyridinic-N, respectively.18 These nitrogen species may provide key sites for anchoring the single metal atom.18,19 Detailed structural information of Fe species at the atomic level can be obtained from the X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS). Fig. 2c shows the Fe K-edge XANES spectra of Fe-SAs/N–C with Fe foil and Fe2O3 as references. Its line intensity of the absorption edge locates between those for the Fe foil and Fe2O3, indicating that the Fe atom valence of Fe-SAs/N–C is situated between Fe0 and Fe3+. In Fig. 2d, the Fourier transform (FT) k3-weighted χ(k) function of the EXAFS spectra for the Fe-SAs/N–C sample shows one main peak at 1.50 Å, which is believed to be that of the Fe–N(O) interaction.19 By contrast, Fe metal exhibits a typical first shell Fe–Fe pair at 2.20 Å, while the Fe–O interaction in Fe2O3 locates at 1.5 Å. No obvious Fe–Fe peak or other high shell peaks are observed in the result of Fe-SAs/N–C, demonstrating that the iron species in the Fe-SAs/N–C catalyst should be at the single atomic level. Furthermore, quantitative EXAFS analyses were performed, and the fitting parameters are listed in Table S1† and the fitting curves are shown in Fig. S2.† According to the fitting results, the first shell of the Fe atom in Fe-SAs/N–C was four-fold coordinated by N atoms with a mean bond length of 1.99 Å (Fig. S2† inset).

With the as-synthesized Fe-SAs/N–C as the cathode catalyst, its activity was then evaluated in a typical H-type cell for electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 (Fig. 3a and Fig. S3a†). A traditional electrolyte (NaHCO3) was first utilized for both cathodic CO2 reduction and anodic reaction of oxygen evolution. The faradaic efficiency of CO (FECO) was found to increase with the negative shift of potential, and reached a maximum value of 99.3% at −0.6 V (Fig. 3b and Fig. S4†). When the cathodic electrolyte was changed to NaCl solution, the achieved maximum FECO (99.6%) was close to that in NaHCO3 solution, whereas the corresponding potential (−0.45 V) was much more positive than that in NaHCO3 solution. This could be related to the different pH values in these two electrolytes. According to the Nernst equation, an acidic environment is favorable for lowering the electrode potential of the reaction (CO2 + 2H+ + 2e− → CO + H2O). In comparison with the NaHCO3 electrolyte (pH = 7.8) widely adopted in CO2 electroreduction, the employment of a CO2-saturated NaCl electrolyte (pH = 4.5) will reduce the standard electrode potential by 195 mV. It should be noted that abundant protons may induce the side reaction of hydrogen evolution at the same time and cause a decrease of faradaic efficiency in CO2 conversion. Fortunately, the Fe-SAs/N–C catalyst possessed a high selectivity towards CO2 reduction and a nearly 100% faradaic efficiency could be achieved in weakly-acidic NaCl solution at −0.45 V, corresponding to an overpotential of 340 mV with reference to the standard potential for the electrochemical reduction of CO2 to CO (−0.11 V).1,20 In addition, the CO formation rates normalized by the reaction area were calculated with reference to other articles,21,22 and the rates increased with the negative shift of potentials (Fig. S5†). The corresponding rate at −0.45 V reached 4.83 μmol cm−2 s−1, which was slightly higher than that reported in other studies.21,22

Different solutions were used in the cathodic electrolyte (0.5 M NaHCO3 or NaCl solution) and the anodic electrolyte (0.5 M NaHCO3). (b) Faradaic efficiencies of CO and the corresponding cell voltages versus potentials in different cathodic electrolytes (NaHCO3 or NaCl solution). (c) LSV curves for Fe-SAs/N–C and Fe-NPs/N–C in the Ar or CO2-saturated NaCl electrolyte at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. (d) Faradaic efficiency of CO versus continuous electrolysis time at −0.45 V on different catalysts. 
Besides the faradaic efficiency, the cell voltages (the potential between the cathode and anode) were also measured under various given potentials. The values of cell voltages with the cathodic NaCl electrolyte are all lower than those with the NaHCO3 electrolyte. This could be attributed to the reduction of electrode potential for the cathodic reaction in the NaCl electrolyte since the anodic reaction conditions were kept the same. The decrease of cell voltage means that less electric potential is required to drive the whole reaction, which further demonstrates the high activity of Fe-SAs/N–C towards the CO2 reduction.
In order to analyze the reason for the high activity of the Fe-SAs/N–C, various measurements were performed to evaluate the electrochemical behaviors of the catalyst. As illustrated by the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) results in Fig. 3c, the cathodic current is improved obviously in CO2-saturated solution as compared with that in Ar-saturated solution, suggesting that Fe-SAs/N–C is capable of catalyzing the electrochemical reduction of CO2 in NaCl solution. Moreover, the onset potential of CO2 reduction is close to −0.20 V, which is more positive than that in other published reports.23–27 For comparison, there is little change of current in LSV curves when the carbon sample is used as a cathodic catalyst (Fig. S6a†). Also, the FECO on the carbon catalyst (<2%) was much lower than that of Fe-SAs/N–C (Fig. S6b†), indicating that the single iron atoms contributed to the enhanced performance of Fe-SAs/N–C. To further investigate the extraordinary properties of single iron atoms, a contrastive sample based on iron nanoparticles (Fe-NPs/N–C) was synthesized by a similar process (Fig. S7 and S8†), and its electrochemical behaviour was also examined. As shown in Fig. 3c, the CO2 reduction on Fe-NPs/N–C is initiated at −0.42 V, which was much more negative than that on Fe-SAs/N–C. The increase of current from CO2 reduction on Fe-NPs/N–C is weak as compared with that on Fe-SAs/N–C. The maximum FECO (19.1%) on the Fe-NPs/N–C electrode was only one-fifth that on Fe-SAs/N–C at the same potential. In addition, the activity of the Fe-NPs/N–C electrode decayed obviously in a short time (Fig. 3d), whereas the FECO on the Fe-SAs/N–C electrode was stable during continuous electrolysis (Fig. 3d and Fig. S9†). It was previously reported that the activities of nanoscale iron catalysts were lower in the electroreduction of CO2.28,29 Here, our synthesized Fe-SAs/N–C catalyst exhibited an unexpectedly high activity, indicating the crucial function of single iron atoms.
To further explore the nature of high CO2RR reactivity over Fe-SAs/N–C, we first used the Tafel slope to deduce if there was any change in the reduction mechanism on the catalysts. Fortunately, stable CO2 reduction efficiency on the Fe-SAs/N–C electrode enabled the procurement of electrokinetic data to probe the mechanism of CO2 reduction. The overpotential data were calculated in the same way as reported in other articles.30,31 The Tafel curve for the Fe-SAs/N–C electrode gave a linear relationship with a slope of 119 mV dec−1 (Fig. S10†), which was close to 118 mV dec−1 expected for the rate-determining step of the initial reduction of CO2 to CO2˙− radical.32,33 By contrast, the Tafel slope obtained on Fe-NPs/N–C (129 mV dec−1) was close to that on Fe-SAs/N–C, indicating that the rate-determining step of CO2 was the same on both Fe-SAs/N–C and Fe-NPs/N–C. Therefore, the enhanced CO2 reduction on Fe-SAs/N–C could not be attributed to the change of mechanism in the conversion of CO2 to CO.
So, what is the real reason for the sharp difference in the activities of Fe-SAs/N–C and Fe-NPs/N–C? One probable cause may be related to the CO2 activation behaviors on these two catalysts, which usually play an important role in the heterogeneous catalytic process. To answer this question, density functional theory (DFT) calculation was performed to analyze the reaction steps in the process of CO2 reduction in detail. The computational details are presented in the ESI (Fig. S11–S13†). The free-energy paths of CO2RR and the detailed reaction energetics at U = 0 V are listed in Fig. 4.

The general electrochemical reduction of CO2 can be divided into four elementary steps (as illustrated by the following equations):34,35(1) CO2 + * → *CO2(2) *CO2 + H+ + e− → *HOCO(3) *HOCO + H+ + e− → *CO + H2O(4) *CO → CO + *
In these steps, the symbol * represents the adsorption site and two steps (2, 3) are involved in the electron transfer. On the Fe-SAs/N–C catalyst, the conversion of *CO2 to *HOCO species in step (2) is endothermic with the highest reaction energy (ΔG = 0.72 eV). Once the *HOCO intermediate is formed, it will tend to be reduced to *CO accompanied by release of energy. The final step (4) of CO desorption is also endothermic, whereas the energy expenditure (ΔG = 0.46 eV) is less than that of step (2). According to the free energetics in Table S2,† it can be seen that the second step is up against an energy barrier of 0.72 eV, which is much higher than that of other steps. According to the free energetics theory, the first electron transfer from the catalyst to the adsorbed CO2 could be the rate-determining step. Similar calculation was also performed on iron nanoparticles. The results show that step (2) is still endothermic and the corresponding reaction energy (ΔG = 1.39 eV) is much higher than that on Fe-SAs/N–C. This sharp contrast indicates that less energy is required to complete the rate-determining step on Fe-SAs/N–C than that on Fe-NPs/N–C. Therefore, the Fe-SAs/N–C catalyst possesses a superior advantage in facilitating the electron transfer to the adsorbed *CO2 species and exhibits high CO2RR activity. This result is in accordance with the experimental results that the absolute value of overpotential for CO2 reduction on Fe-SAs/N–C is lower than that on Fe-NPs/N–C.
After the accomplishment of the first objective of developing a powerful cathodic catalyst for CO2 reduction, we then worked on the buildup of anodic production of hypochlorite and optimized relative parameters. A commercial ruthenium oxide coated titanium electrode (RuO2/Ti) was used as the working electrode, while the Pt electrode served as a counter electrode (Fig. 5a and Fig. S3b†). The total hypochlorite concentration was measured by using a light-absorbance method (standard curve in Fig. S14†).36 Various potentials were applied onto the RuO2/Ti electrode and the corresponding faradaic efficiency of hypochlorite increased linearly with the positive shift of potential, reaching a maximum value of 99% at 1.5 V vs. RHE (Fig. 5b). At the same time, the cell voltage gradually increased to 2.1 V. Total hypochlorite concentrations were determined by ion chromatography. Ion chromatography was also used to analyze the hypochlorite concentration (standard curve in Fig. S15a†) and the faradaic efficiency of hypochlorite determined by this method was close to that measured by UV-vis spectrophotometry (Fig. S15b†), indicating that UV-vis spectrophotometry could provide reliable measurement results.

(b) Dependence of the faradaic efficiency of hypochlorite and the cell voltage on the potentials applied on the Pt cathode in 0.5 M NaCl electrolyte. 
To determine the optimum chloride concentration for hypochlorite production, electrolysis was performed under various concentrations of NaCl solution, while the total concentration of Na+ was kept at 1.0 M by adding NaClO4. As illustrated in Fig. S16,† the current efficiency of hypochlorite production slightly increased and then remained almost unchanged when the chloride concentration was adjusted from 0.1 to 1.0 M. Meanwhile, the cell voltage decreased slightly with the increase of chloride concentration. According to the above experimental results, subsequent experiments were conducted in 0.5 M sodium chloride solution without special instructions.
Since the cathodic and anode reactions have been optimized independently, the next step is to couple these two half reactions to achieve our target of efficient energy utilization. As illustrated by the schematic structure in Fig. 6a and Fig. S3c,† the combined electrolysis can be expressed by the following equations:Cathode: CO2 + 2H+ + 2e− → CO + H2OAnode: Cl− + 2OH− → ClO− + H2O + 2e−Total reaction: CO2 + Cl− → CO + ClO−

After electrolysis, the net reaction is the yield of CO and hypochlorite with the consumption of CO2 and chloride. Various potentials were then applied onto the Fe-SAs/N–C cathode, while the ruthenium oxide coated titanium electrode served as the anode. The corresponding faradaic efficiencies of CO and hypochlorite are listed in Fig. 6b. Interestingly, when a potential of −0.45 V was applied to achieve the maximum efficiency of CO production on the cathode, the efficiency of hypochlorite production also reached a maximum value (∼99%). These two reactions were so perfectly coordinated that nearly 100% electrons were utilized to generate valuable products, indicating the promising advantage of this electrolysis system in electron economy.
Besides faradaic efficiency, energy efficiency as an index of energy consumption was widely used to evaluate the comprehensive performance of the reaction system. Improving energy efficiency is believed to be one of the most cost-effective ways to reduce the environmental impact of electricity generation, which is consistent with the concept of green chemistry. In this work, the energy efficiency of the process was calculated from the following equation with reference to previous reports:31,37  
FECO and FEClO− represent the faradaic efficiencies of CO and ClO−, respectively, and the theoretic voltage (1.67 V) was calculated from the theoretic electrode potentials of two half reactions (see the ESI†). The cell voltage was measured using a multimeter and the results are listed in Fig. S17.† Surprisingly, a voltage of 1.7 V could start the entire electrolytic reaction, which has an energy efficiency of nearly 20%. At a voltage of 2.0 V, the energy efficiency could reach a maximum value as high as 82%. If the voltage was increased to 2.25 V, the energy efficiency would decrease due to the loss of Faraday efficiency.
The long-term stability of this electrolysis system was also investigated to evaluate the cooperation of these two half reactions. Electrolysis at a controlled potential of 0.45 V (vs. RHE) was performed, and the faradaic efficiencies and energy efficiency were well maintained without obvious decay for 24-hour continuous operation (Fig. 7a). Meanwhile, the corresponding current density and cell voltage were also stable (Fig. S18†), demonstrating the excellent electrocatalytic durability of this system.

Considering that electricity from renewable energy was preferable in CO2 conversion, we tried using a solar cell to provide voltage (2.0 V) directly on the Fe-SAs/N–C cathode and ruthenium oxide/titanium anode without the use of a reference electrode. As illustrated in Fig. 7b, considerably high faradaic efficiencies (93% of CO and 92% of ClO−) and energy efficiency (71%) could also be achieved in this two-electrode system during continuous electrolysis. It was found that the actual cathode potential fluctuated during the electrolysis driven by the solar cell (Fig. S19†). Therefore, the achieved faradaic efficiency and energy efficiency were different from those produced by the three-electrode system driven by an electrochemical workstation. Nevertheless, the combined electrolysis system showed good adaptability to the two-electrode structure and power supply from the solar cell in preliminary attempts. It is expected that our research results may provide a feasible electrolysis model for future CO2 conversion with high utilization of electrical energy.
Conclusions
In conclusion, an active and inexpensive catalyst (Fe-SAs/N–C) based on single iron atoms was firstly designed for efficient conversion of CO2 to CO with an extremely high faradaic efficiency over 99.6% at an overpotential of 0.34 V. Further investigations revealed the dominant role of single iron atoms and the corresponding function mechanism in the CO2 reduction. In order to fully utilize the electrical energy, we attempted to couple the cathodic half reaction of CO2 reduction with an anodic half reaction for producing valuable hypochlorite in the same salt electrolyte. It was amazing to find that the Fe-SAs/N–C catalyst also worked well in a weakly-acidic salt solution and that these two half reactions matched perfectly to give the maximum faradaic efficiencies of ∼99% for both CO and hypochlorite products. There were scarcely any side products and nearly 100% atom economy could be achieved in this electrolysis process (CO2 + NaCl → CO + NaClO). Impressively, the energy efficiency of this electrolysis system reached as high as 82% at low cell voltage (2.0 V) and exhibited no obvious decay over continuous electrolysis. According to the conclusion drawn in a recent review,38 electrocatalytic conversion of CO2 would be cost-competitive with fossil fuel-driven conversion under optimistic targets (Faraday efficiency = 90%, energy efficiency = 70%). In this work, both the energy efficiency (82%) and faradaic efficiency (99.6%) were higher than the expected values, indicating the potential prospect of this electrolytic system. We believe that this study paves a promising way to realize electrochemical reactions with full utilization of electricity by coupling CO2 reduction with other reactions.
