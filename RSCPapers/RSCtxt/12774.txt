As an important part of PSCs, the hole-transporting layer (HTL) plays a crucial role in the overall device performance. Zinc porphyrin (ZnP) has excellent thermal/chemical stability, which is beneficial for enhancing the stability of PSCs when it is used as the HTL. In addition, the strong hydrophobicity of the electropolymerized film surface is believed to suppress heterogeneous nucleation and thus improve the quality of the resulting perovskite film. Herein, we have utilized the electropolymerized ZnP (PZnP) to fabricate the dopant-free HTL without annealing. The MAPb(CI0.05I0.95)3 PSCs based on PZnP presented a record-high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.75%, which was significantly improved as compared to the previously reported best result of 16.7% with electropolymerized HTL. The unencapsulated PSCs sustained around 70% of the initial efficiency after thermal aging at 85 °C for 480 h, while the PTAA-based PSCs showed a 78% decrease in the initial PCE under the same conditions. Moreover, the long-term stability of the electropolymerized film-based PSCs was exceptional, retaining about 96% of the initial performance over 5000 h. The electropolymerization strategy provides an effective approach for developing cost-effective dopant-free HTL for thermally stable and efficient PSCs.
Introduction
Over the past decade, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have rapidly emerged as superstars in the photovoltaics field, with the highest certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) rivalling that of silicon-based solar cells.1–3 To fabricate highly efficient PSCs, the active perovskite layer is sandwiched between the electron-transport layer (ETL) and the hole-transport layer (HTL).4,5 According to the positions of the ETL and HTL, the device can be divided into mesoscopic n-i-p, planar n-i-p and inverted planar p-i-n structures.6,7 The typical n-i-p structured PSCs with 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-(p-methoxyphenyl)amino)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) as the hole-transport material (HTM) exhibit the highest PCEs.8 Inverted planar PSCs possess several advantages over mesoscopic devices, such as an easy fabrication process, negligible hysteresis, and low annealing temperature process, which are more conducive to future commercialization.9,10 While the efficiency of PSCs has met the requirements of commercialization, the long-term stability of devices is one of the urgent problems to be solved.11 Various strategies, such as compositional engineering,12 charge transport materials preparation,13 application of UV filters,14 and encapsulation methods,15 have been introduced to enhance the stability of PSCs. Among them, the development of dopant-free HTMs provides an effective means to improve the long-term stability of devices.16,17
Currently, the commercialized polymers poly[bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl) amine] (PTAA) and poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonic acid (PEDOT:PSS) are routinely used in p-i-n-structured PSCs as the HTM due to their superior hole mobilities.18,19 However, the biggest limitation of PTAA is the batch-to-batch variability and high cost. PSCs using PEDOT:PSS demonstrate poor stability owing to its hygroscopic nature. Therefore, tremendous efforts have been undertaken to develop inexpensive and readily available dopant-free HTMs for p-i-n PSCs. Recently, the use of electropolymerized films as dopant-free HTMs has been identified as an attractive approach to enhance the stability of PSCs. Electropolymerization has the advantages of simple operation and high-quality film and can effectively solve the problem of the poor solubility of monomers.20,21 The film formed by electropolymerization possesses good stability and high hydrophobicity, which are beneficial for fabricating stable PSCs. For instance, Zhu et al. obtained a PCE of 10% based on the HTM of a porous aromatic framework (PAF-86) through electrochemical polymerization.22 Bian et al. used electropolymerized poly(p-phenylene) as the HTM to fabricate PSCs with the best PCE of 16.7%.23 In our previous work, electropolymerized polyamine films were applied as the HTM in inverted (FAPbI3)x(MAPbBr3)1−x PSCs to achieve a PCE of 16.5% with good performance stability (FA = formamidinium; MA = methylammonium).24 These works have demonstrated the promising applications of electropolymerized films in p-i-n PSCs. However, the PCEs of PSCs with electropolymerized HTMs have never surpassed 17%.
Porphyrin derivatives have attracted intense interest as HTMs in PSCs due to their excellent thermal/chemical stability, low cost, and easy structure modification.25,26 In 2016, the Yeh group first reported two porphyrin HTMs (Y2 and Y2A2) consisting of a porphyrin core with bilateral butyl chains.27 The PSCs with Y2 and Y2A2 as the HTM yielded a PCE of 16.60% and 10.55%, respectively. Jung et al. synthesized a series of pyridine-functionalized porphyrin HTMs and investigated the effect of the pyridine group on the performance of HTMs.28 Cao and co-workers employed a mixture of Co(II) and Co(III)-based porphyrin compounds as HTM and the PSCs achieved a PCE of 20.5%.29 Recently, a series of D2h symmetric D–π–D-type Zn porphyrin HTMs (MDA4, MTA4, and MDA8) have been reported by Gao and co-workers.30 The solar cells (FTO/SnO2/FA0.8MA0.2PbI3/p-FPEAI/HTM/Au) with MDA4 exhibited a PCE of 22.67% (p-FPEAI = 2-(4-fluorophenyl)ethylamine iodide). Furthermore, the unencapsulated MDA4 PSCs exhibited excellent thermal stability by maintaining 88% of the initial efficiency after 360 h at 60 °C and 60% RH. Although porphyrin derivatives yielded PCEs over 20% in PSCs, the dopants of lithium bis(trifluoromethyl sulfonyl) imide (Li-TFSI), and 4-tert-butylpyridine (t-BP) were still needed to improve the conductivity. It is still a challenge to develop dopant-free porphyrin HTMs to fabricate efficient PSCs.
Herein, we utilize the ZnII porphyrin (ZnP) compound ZnP-TPA functionalized with triphenylamine (TPA) groups on the porphine ring to fabricate the dopant-free HTM by the electropolymerization method, which is simple and cost-effective, without producing large amounts of solvent and material waste. The networked molecular structure and strong hydrophobicity of electropolymerized films are beneficial to improving the stability of the device. The optimized PSC devices based on the electropolymerized porphyrin HTM achieved a high efficiency of 19.75% with an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.10 V, short circuit current (Jsc) of 22.40 mA cm−2, and fill factor (FF) of 80.09% with little hysteresis, which represents the best performance of dopant-free electropolymerized HTMs. Furthermore, the unencapsulated PSCs maintained 67% of initial efficiency after 480 h of continuous annealing at 85 °C. The PSCs retained 96% of the initial efficiency after being stored for 5000 h in a glove box, suggestive of their excellent stability.
Results and discussion
The monomer ZnP-TPA (Fig. 1a) was prepared according to literature methods.28 The synthetic details are given in the ESI† (Fig. S1). ZnP-TPA was synthesized by the Buchwald–Hartwig amination reaction of 5,10,15,20-tetra(p-bromophenyl)porphyrin zinc and diarylamines in 75% yield. The synthesis of ZnP-TPA is much cheaper as compared to PTAA and Spiro-OMeTAD. The structure and purity of ZnP-TPA were characterized by 1H NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry.

The cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves of monomer ZnP-TPA showed multiple consecutive redox peaks at +0.80, +0.92 and +1.31 V vs. Ag/AgCl in 0.1 M nBu4NClO4/CH2Cl2 at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1, as shown in Fig. 1b. ZnP-TPA was electropolymerized on a Pt disk electrode (d = 2 mm) by the repetitive CV mode in which the thickness of the polymeric film can be controlled by the scan cycles and potential. Electropolymerization occurs when the potential scans are between 0 and +1.5 V vs. Ag/AgCl (Fig. 1b, black line). When the potential was scanned between 0 and +1.05 V vs. Ag/AgCl, no obvious polymerization occurred (Fig. 1b, red line). The triphenylamines of ZnP-TPA were electrochemically oxidized into aminium cation radicals, leading to the formation of polymeric networks connected by tetraphenylbenzidine bridges.31 The new peak at +1.20 V vs. Ag/AgCl could be assigned to the in situ-generated tetraphenylbenzidine bridge. The gradual increase in peak currents with the increase of scan cycles indicated the growth of the polymeric film on the electrode.32 After electropolymerization, the resulting polymeric film was washed with CH2Cl2 to remove unpolymerized monomers and supporting electrolytes.

Fig. 1c shows the CV curve and differential pulse voltammogram (DPV) of the obtained PZnP film in 0.1 M nBu4NClO4/CH2Cl2. This polymer is chemically stable and cannot dissolve in common solvents due to its cross-linking structures. The electrochemical results also show that the basic structure of the monomer ZnP-TPA is retained in the electropolymerized film. The thermal behaviour of the electropolymerized film was examined by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) (Fig. 1d), which showed that the porphyrin polymeric film is characterized by excellent thermal stability. We performed ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) measurements to determine the energy level of the polymeric film. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level of the electropolymerized film was estimated to be −5.6 eV (Fig. 1e). The HOMO level matches the valence band (−5.9 eV) of the perovskite we used (MAPb(Cl0.05I0.95)3),33 which is believed to be beneficial for the hole transport.
To examine the effect of film thickness on the device performance, we prepared a series of polymers with different thicknesses by changing the scan cycles (Fig. S2†). The thickness of the polymeric film with different scan cycles was characterized by the cross-section scanning electron microscope (SEM) analysis, as shown in Fig. S3.† The electropolymerized films obtained after 2, 4, 6, 8, 15 and 25 scan cycles are denoted as PZnP-2, PZnP-4, PZnP-6, PZnP-8, PZnP-15 and PZnP-25, respectively. The thickness of these films was estimated to be 55, 63, 79, 92, 123 and 236 ± 4 nm, respectively. The absorption spectra of the monomer ZnP-TPA and the electropolymerized film PZnP are shown in Fig. 1f. Compared with the monomer ZnP-TPA, the absorption spectrum of the PZnP film was slightly expanded. The absorption peak of PZnP shifted bathochromically to 447 nm, which is due to the extended π-electron delocalization caused by the formation of the tetraphenylbenzidine bridge.34 Some small domains of irregular shapes were observed on the top of the polymeric film of PZnP-4 (Fig. 2a), but the film surface was uniform and flat. As shown in Fig. 2b, the root mean square (RMS) of the polymer is 1.6 nm as measured by atomic force microscopy (AFM), which is similar to that of PTAA (1.3 nm). Compared with the spin coating method, the surface roughness of the electropolymerized film showed no significant increase.

To investigate the effect of the electropolymerized films on the growth and properties of perovskite films, the perovskite film was fabricated atop the polymeric film. The surface contact angles of the PTAA (undoped PTAA was used for comparison unless otherwise specified) and PZnP were determined (the droplet is H2O). As shown in Fig. 2c, the contact angles on PTAA and PZnP were 69.2° and 92.1°, respectively. The obvious discrepancy in the contact angles resulted in different morphologies of the solution-processed perovskite film. Previous studies have confirmed that the hydrophobicity of the HTM surface would suppress the heterogeneous nucleation of the perovskite. Less nucleation on the film surface is beneficial to forming the polycrystalline perovskite film with large grain sizes.35 As shown in Fig. 3a and b, the grain size of the perovskite film based on PZnP is much larger than that of the perovskite based on PTAA, and it has significantly fewer pinholes. The hydrophobicity of the polymeric film surface is considered to be beneficial for the vertical growth of the perovskite crystals, leading to the formation of a high-quality perovskite film with compact and large-sized crystals. AFM images in Fig. 3b show that the RMS roughness of the perovskite film based on PTAA and PZnP are 9.8 and 8.2 nm, respectively, indicating that lower roughness is more beneficial to increasing the ohmic contact between the perovskite hole transfer layers. The high quality of the perovskite crystals was also proven by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. As shown in Fig. 3c, the dominant diffraction peaks at 14.3°, 28.6° and 43.4° correspond, respectively, to the (110), (220) and (330) crystal planes.36 The diffraction peak intensity of the perovskite film with PZnP was enhanced as compared to the perovskite film with PTAA, indicating the remarkable improvement in the crystallinity of the perovskite film.

(c) XRD patterns of perovskite (PVK)/PTAA and PVK/PZnP films. (d) Steady-state PL and (e) time-resolved PL decay spectra of glass/PVK, PTAA/PVK and PZnP-4/PVK films. 
Steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved PL (TRPL) measurements were carried out to explore the hole extraction and transport capacities of the electropolymerized films. As shown in Fig. 3d, compared to glass/PVK, PTAA/PVK, the perovskite film based on PZnP-4 exhibited a much lower PL intensity, meaning more efficient hole extraction at perovskite/HTL interfaces.37 This was further confirmed by the TRPL measurements (Fig. 3e). The results of the TRPL decay were fitted with the biexponential function τave = A1exp(−t/τ1) + A2exp(−t/τ2).38 The glass/perovskite film exhibited the longest decay of τave = 153.58 ns (τ1 = 9.19, τ2 = 159.71 ns). In contrast, the carrier lifetime was significantly shortened when the perovskite films were deposited on top of the HTM. The perovskite film deposited on PZnP-4 showed a shorter lifetime (τave = 8.58 ns) than that deposited on PTAA (τave = 17.89 ns). These results indicated that PZnP-4 has better hole extraction efficiency, which is beneficial for inhibiting charge accumulation recombination.39
We prepared the PSCs with a p-i-n architecture (ITO/electropolymerized film PZnP/Perovskite/PC61BM/PEI/Ag) (Fig. 4a) to evaluate the performance of the device. The effects of film thickness on the device performance are shown in Fig. 4b and Table 1. With the thickness of the film increasing from PZnP-2 to PZnP-6, the PCE of the device increased from 17.62% to 19.13%. However, when the thickness further increased, the fill factor of the device began to fall, accompanied by a decrease in efficiency. Next, under the same electropolymerization cycle, we adjusted the concentration of electropolymerization to study its influence on the device performance (Fig. 4c and Table 2) and determined that the optimal concentration was 0.12 mg mL−1. A champion efficiency of PSCs based on PZnP-4 was obtained with a Voc of 1.10 V, a Jsc of 22.40 mA cm−2, a FF of 80.09% and a PCE of 19.75% with a small hysteresis index (HI) (Fig. 4d). The performance of PZnP-based PSCs was slightly better than that of the standard HTM PTAA (Voc = 1.09 V, Jsc = 22.41 mA cm−2, FF = 77.97%, PCE = 19.12%). As shown in Fig. 4d, the PSC based on PTAA had a significant hysteresis (HI = 5.4%), while the PZnP-based PSC had negligible hysteresis (HI = 1.6%). Efficiency statistics based on 20 devices confirmed the good reproducibility of the results (Fig. 4e and S4†). We also tested the performance of the PZnP-based device with different perovskite materials (MAPbI3, MAPb(I0.95Br0.05)3). The corresponding devices gave acceptable PCEs of 19.07% and 18.34%, respectively (Fig. S5 and Table S1†). This suggests that PZnP can be used with different perovskite materials. Fig. 4f presents the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of PSCs. The integrated photocurrent of the devices based on PZnP and PTAA are 21.73 mA cm−2 and 21.61 mA cm−2, respectively. These values are in good agreement with those observed from the J–V measurements.

The space-charge-limited current (SCLC) model was employed to quantitatively evaluate the surface defect density of the perovskite film based on ZnP and PTAA.40 Both devices showed the linear ohmic-type response at low bias voltage until the voltage beyond the kink point was reached, namely, the trap-filled limit voltage (VTFL) (Fig. 5a).41 The VTFL for the perovskites based on PZnP and PTAA were 0.13 and 0.35 V, respectively. The defect density (Nt) can be obtained by the equation Nt = 2εε0VTFL/eL2, where e represents the elementary charge, Nt is the defect density, ε is the relative dielectric constant of the perovskite, ε0 is the vacuum permittivity and L is the thickness of the perovskite films, respectively.42 The relative dielectric constant of the perovskite is 46.9. The thickness of the perovskite film is about 450 nm according to the section of the SEM. As a result, the PSCs based on PZnP had a remarkably lower defect density Nt = 1.32 × 1015 cm−3 as compared with the PSCs based on PTAA with Nt = 3.56 ×1015 cm−3.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) characterizations were further conducted to investigate the passivation effect of the perovskite film (Fig. 5b). The bare perovskite film showed two XPS peaks at 138.31 eV and 143.16 eV, representing Pb 4f7/2 and Pb 4f5/2, respectively.43 In comparison with the bare perovskite film, the two Pb 4f peaks in the perovskite film based on PZnP showed a clear shift toward a lower binding energy region at 138.19 eV and 143.02 eV, respectively. This is good evidence of defect state reduction.44 Furthermore, the dark current leakage of the PSCs based on PZnP was remarkably reduced as compared with the PSCs based on PTAA (Fig. 5c). The lower current leakage proved the presence of fewer defects in PSCs, which is a reason for improving the performance of the device.45
Stability is an urgent problem to be solved for PSCs. Therefore, we investigated the stability of the unencapsulated PSCs. As shown in Fig. 6a, the unencapsulated device based on PZnP can maintain 96% of the initial efficiency after being stored in the glove box for 5000 h, whereas only 40% of the initial PCE was retained for the PTAA-based device. These devices were also measured at 85 °C on a hotplate in an N2 glovebox, as presented in Fig. 6b. The results show that the device based on PZnP demonstrated good thermal stability, maintaining 67% of its initial PCE after 480 h, which was better than 22% for the PTAA based device. Besides, as shown in Fig. 6c, the maximum power point (MPP) tracking for 600 s was measured to assess the stabilized PCEs of the corresponding cells at the MPP voltage (Vmax). The output current of the PZnP-based PSC was stable after 600 s, while the output current of the PTAA-based device decreased. The excellent stability of the PSC based on PZnP is partially attributed to the good thermal/chemical stability of porphyrin molecules.46

Conclusions
We have demonstrated an electropolymerized film based on Zn-porphyrin and its application as a dopant-free HTL for high-performance PSCs. The hydrophobicity of the electropolymerized film PZnP suppressed the heterogeneous nucleation and realized large grain sizes and fewer defects of the resulting perovskite film. The best efficiency of the PSCs based on PZnP is 19.75%, which is a record-high value in this field and was significantly boosted as compared to the previously-reported best PCE of 16.7% based on electropolymerized HTMs.23 Due to the excellent thermal/chemical stability of the PZnP, the PSCs maintained 97% of the initial efficiency after storage in a N2 atmosphere for 5000 h. Furthermore, the PSCs based on PZnP retained 67% of the initial efficiency after 480 h of continuous annealing at 85 °C. The electropolymerization strategy provides a low-cost and simple way to fabricate the dopant-free HTL, promoting the commercial application and further reduction of the fabrication costs of PSCs.

Suitable amounts of the single crystals of MAPbCl3 and MAPbI3 were weighed according to the composition of MAPb(Cl0.05I0.95)3. The mixed sample was placed in a small vial containing a magneton. This vial was then placed in a larger vial containing the ethanol solution of methylamine (33% wt). The crystals were dissolved with the aid of the ethanol/methylamine vapours. To the resulting sample was added a suitable amount of the ethanol solution of methylamine and acetonitrile (6/4, v/v) to afford the solution of MAPb(Cl0.05I0.95)3 with a concentration of 1.2 M (the volume of the ethanol/methylamine vapours in the first step is not considered).
Fabrication of the electropolymerized film
The ITO glass was washed with DI water, acetone, ethanol, and isopropanol with ultrasonication for 20 min each and dried with nitrogen gas. A solution of the monomer ZnP-TPA in 5 mL of CH2Cl2 with a concentration of 0.12 M was prepared, to which 170 mg of tetrabutylammonium perchlorate was added as the electrolyte. An Ag/AgCl electrode was used as the reference electrode and a Pt disk electrode or ITO was used as the working electrode. The counter electrode was a platinum coil. The electropolymerization was performed by repeated cyclic voltammetric scans between 0 and +1.5 V vs. Ag/AgCl with a CHI 620D potentiostat. The time for one CV scan cycle was 30 seconds. The obtained electropolymer films were thoroughly washed with CH2Cl2, followed by drying under N2 gas. Electropolymerized films with different thicknesses were deposited on ITO by adjusting the number of scan cycles.
Fabrication of the perovskite solar cells
The device has a configuration of glass/ITO/PZnP or PTAA/perovskite/PC61BM/PEI/Ag. The ITO glass coated with the electropolymerized films was dried with nitrogen gas and then transferred to a glove box without annealing. The ITO glass deposited with PTAA (2 mg mL−1 in toluene) by spin-coating at 3000 rpm for 30 s with an acceleration of 1000 rpm was annealed at 100 °C for 30 min in the glove box before use. The MAPb(Cl0.05I0.95)3 solution (40 μL) was deposited onto the substrate by spin-coating at 5000 rpm for 60 s with an acceleration of 1000 rpm (the perovskite solution was quickly dropped onto the substrate in the last 50 s of the spin coating). The color of the substrate gradually changed from transparent to light brown, dark brown, and black. The substrate was then placed on the hot plate at 100 °C for 10 min. After annealing, PC61BM and PEI were spin-coated on the substrate at 3000 rpm for 40 s and 5000 rpm for 60 s, respectively. Finally, the Ag electrode (100 nm) was deposited on the PEI layer by thermal evaporation.
Characterization
The thermal loss was characterized using a thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA, 8000) in the temperature range from 25 to 400 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. The morphologies of PZnP and perovskite films were determined using a field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, Hitachi, S-4800, 5 kV, 10 mA). The roughness of the PZnP and perovskite films was determined by using an atomic force microscope (nanoscope multimode Bruker). The XRD spectra of the perovskite based on PTAA and PZnP were obtained using the X'Pert powder X-ray diffractometer (XRD, Bruker D8) with monochromatic Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å, 40 kV, 40 mA). Absorbance spectra were obtained using a PerkinElmer Lambda 750 spectrometer. The steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra were obtained by using a steady-state and lifetime spectrometer (FLS980, Edinburgh Instruments Ltd.). Ultraviolet photoelectron spectra (UPS) were obtained by using the AXIS Ultra DLD (Kratos Analytical) surface analysis system with ultrahigh vacuum. The J–V curves of the PSCs were obtained under AM 1.5G solar irradiation at 100 mW cm−2 (Enli Tech, Class AAA solar simulator) with the scan rate of 0.02 V s−1. The light intensity was calibrated by standard silicon cells. The active area of the PSCs was defined by a mask (0.04 cm2). The external quantum efficiency (EQE) was measured by illumination with monochromatic light (Enli Tech, Class AAA solar simulator, QE-mini) in the wavelength range of 300–850 nm.
