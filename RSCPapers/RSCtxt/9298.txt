    , Accepted 30th October 2014First published on 30th October 2014AbstractA two-dimensional (2D) low bandgap polymer (PDTS-Ph-TTz) based on dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]silole (DTS) with phenyl substitution on the bridging silicon atom and thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole (TTz) was designed and synthesized for photovoltaic applications. The impact of conjugated side chains on the optical, electrochemical and energy levels of the polymer was studied. The phenyl substituted DTS polymer exhibited a 0.16 eV down-shifted highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level and ca. 0.1 eV narrowed bandgap in comparison to the corresponding polymers with alkyl substitution on the silicon bridge. The influence of the blend weight ratio, the PFN layer, mixed solvent, THF exposure and polar solvent treatment and thermal annealing on the performance of PDTS-Ph-TTz:PC71BM devices was studied. PDTS-Ph-TTz:PC71BM (1:1, weight ratio) devices delivered the highest power conversion efficiency of 2.14% by using the PFN layer and THF annealing. Thermal annealing was found to exert a negative effect on the device performance. The morphology evolution of blend films processed with different solvents explained the difference in device performance. The results indicate that phenyl substitution is an effective way to tune the HOMO and bandgap of polymer donors for enhanced photovoltaic performance with the as-demonstrated 2D-conjugated DTS structure.
1 Introduction
In recent years, polymer solar cells (PSCs) have been intensively developed as a promising technology to solve the dramatic growing demand for energy, due to their outstanding merits of cost-effectiveness, lightweight, and large-scale roll-to-roll production.1–6 To date, bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) has become the state-of-the-art device structure for PSCs, where an interpenetrating network of donors and acceptors was solution-blended as the active layer. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of BHJ PSCs has increased substantially over the past few years with the collective efforts in development of new materials, optimization of device processing and design of new device architectures.7–10 The impressive PCEs have been often reported over 8%,11–14 with a champion record of 9.48% of a single solar cell.15 However, these devices still exhibit rather low PCEs relative to silicon-based solar cells. And the PCEs must be further improved to meet the requirements of commercialization applications. Currently, the molecular design to find ideal conjugated polymers combining high PCE with convenient processability is one of the key issues, though challenging topics may include encapsulation and robust large-area processing for device making.1,7
It has been well-recognized that the ideal polymer donors for PSCs should exhibit broad absorption, high hole mobility, a suitable energy level, and appropriate compatibility with fullerene acceptors.1,24 The meeting of all design criteria can lead to high values of short-circuit current (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc), and fill factor (FF), which are all proportional to the PCEs of the PSCs.16–18 Until now, there has been a major challenge for next-generation PSCs in the development of more effective low bandgap polymers in conjunction with appropriate energy levels. Among various successful polymers used for highly efficient solar cells, donor–acceptor (D–A) alternating structure taking advantage of the orbital mixing of the donating and the accepting moieties is the most feasible approach to achieve low bandgap polymers.19–29 As known, dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]silole (DTS) is an appealing D unit used in constructing conjugated D–A copolymers for high efficiency PSCs.30–36 DTS with the structure of 2,2′-bithiophene bridged by a silicon atom at the 3,3′-position shows enlargement of π-conjugation of the bithiophene unit as well as its molecular coplanarity due to the silicon bridge. Additionally, the presence of the silicon-bridged atom in the polymer backbone effectively enhanced the crystallinity, interchain π–π packing and carrier transport of polymers.31 Besides the above merits, one must be aware that the type, size and shape of side chains in the silicon-bridged atom are classic topics in organic synthesis which affect not only the solubility but also the molecular packing, the morphology, charge transport and photovoltaic properties of the polymers. For example, copolymers of DTS (PSOTT and PSETT) with linear and branched alkyl side chains have obtained favourable PCEs of 4–5%, accompanied by dramatic Jsc of 10–12 mA cm−2 and Voc of 0.56–0.65 V.35 The ethylhexyl substituted DTS polymer delivered a PCE as high as 6% with a Jsc of 17.3 mA cm−2 and a Voc of 0.57 V.36 Obviously, the polymers based on DTS with non-conjugated side chains exhibited low Voc values in PSCs, limiting the PCEs of photovoltaic devices.8,24 Indeed, among DTS-based polymers, few exhibit PCEs greater than 7% in BHJ devices, mainly due to their high-lying highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels or large bandgaps. It has been a great challenge in molecular design of novel photovoltaic polymers to simultaneously achieve high Voc and Jsc until now.
Inspired by the design concept of two-dimensional benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) units in extending the π-conjugation from the backbone to the side chains19,37–39 and retaining planarization by covalently fastening aromatic units as side chains to elongate the effective conjugation length, facilitate π-electron delocalization and enhance the intrinsic charge mobility,21,28 we are intrigued to know whether the incorporation of conjugated side chains onto the bridging silicon atom of DTS can effectively tune the bandgap and photovoltaic properties of the resultant DTS polymer.
In this paper, we designed and synthesized a phenyl substituted (DTS-Ph) as a 2-D donating unit to extend the π-conjugation. By alternating with thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole (TTz)40 a new D–A copolymer PDTS-Ph-TTz was further developed. The thermal stability, optical and electrochemical properties, and photovoltaic characteristics of the resultant polymer were studied. Further optimization of the device performance was conducted with insertion of a PFN layer,41 screening of solvent and additive,42,43 solvent annealing,44,45 polar solvent treatment46 and thermal annealing.47,48 Encouragingly, the devices based on the PDTS-Ph-TTz:PC71BM (1:1) blend exhibited a double improvement in PCE, with the highest efficiency of 2.14% obtained under AM 1.5G (100 mW cm−2) irradiation in the ambient air.
2 Results and discussion
2.1 Synthesis and characterization
The synthetic routes to obtain the DTS-Ph monomer and PDTS-Ph-TTz are outlined in Scheme 1. Firstly, the lithiation of 5,5′-ditrimethylsiyl-3,3′-dibromo-2,2′-bithiophene 1 led to 3,3′-dilithium-2,2′-bithiophene, which was subjected to nucleophilic addition with dichlorobis(phenyl)silane to furnish the key heterocyclic compound 2 in a good yield (60%). It should be noted that reaction with diethyl ether as solvent instead of THF/diethyl ether was not successful. An ensuing bromination of 2 with NBS afforded the targeted donor DTS-Ph in 62% yield under dark conditions. With dibrominated DTS-Ph monomer at hand, its polycondensation with a tin reagent of an electron-accepting monomer TTz-Tin was conducted by Pd-catalyzed Stille coupling to afford the targeted polymer PDTS-Ph-TTz. After Soxhlet extraction with methanol and hexane, the pure polymer was obtained with a yield of 70%. The polymer exhibits good solubility in common organic solvents such as THF, CF, chlorobenzene (CB) and toluene.

The molecular weight and polydispersity index (PDI) were measured by GPC analysis. The polymer exhibited a number-average molecular weight (Mn) of 5.52 kDa, with a corresponding PDI of 1.12. The thermal stability of the polymer was investigated by TGA analysis, with the TGA traces plotted in Fig. 1a. A degradation temperature (Td, corresponding to 5% weight loss) of 320 °C was found for PDTS-Ph-TTz. This high Td value indicates the good thermal stability of the polymer, which is beneficial for its application in opto-electronic devices.

2.2 Optical properties

Fig. 1b shows the UV-vis absorption spectra of dilute polymer solution in CF (∼1 × 10−5 M) and film spin-coated onto quartz substrates. It can be seen that PDTS-Ph-TTz solution showed an absorption maximum (λmax) at 570 nm with an absorption shoulder at 656 nm. This curve is very similar to that of alkylated DTS derived polymers.32,35 In comparison to the solution, PDTS-Ph-TTz film exhibits a 30 nm red-shifted λmax and 13 nm red-shifted absorption edge (λonset), indicating the strong intermolecular interaction and aggregation occurring in the solid-state of polymer. This may be explained by the effective intermolecular π–π packing interactions in its solid state. The optical bandgap (Eoptg) of polymer can be estimated by the λonset value of polymer film according to the empirical equation Eoptg = 1240/λonset. The Eoptg of polymer was thus calculated to be 1.71 eV, which is 0.08 and 0.11 eV narrower than PSOTT and PSETT with octyl and ethylhexyl substitutions on the silicon bridge, respectively.35
2.3 Electrochemical properties
The HOMO and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of conjugated polymers can be determined using CV measurements. The CV traces of polymer films on the Pt electrode are shown in Fig. 1c, with the potential of ferrocene 0.40 V vs. SCE used as the internal standard. On the basis of 4.8 eV below vacuum for the energy level of Fc/Fc+, the HOMO level of PDTS-Ph-TTz is calculated from the onset oxidation potential (Eonsetox) with the equation: HOMO = −e(Eonsetox + 4.4) (eV). The Eonsetox of PDTS-Ph-TTz was observed to be 0.86 eV. Accordingly, the HOMO energy level of PDTS-Ph-TTz is determined to be −5.26 eV. Since only an oxidation peak of polymer film was obtained, the LUMO level of the polymer is calculated using HOMO and Eoptg according to the equation: LUMO = HOMO + Eoptg (eV). The LUMO level of PDTS-Ph-TTz is thus calculated to be −3.53 eV. The HOMO–LUMO energy diagrams of the polymer and PC71BM are shown in Fig. 1d. Apparently, the HOMO energy level of PDTS-Ph-TTz with phenyl conjugated side chains is lower than that of PSOTT and PSETT (−5.1 eV),35 indicating that this polymer when used as a donor for BHJ cells could generate desirable Voc and maintain good chemical stability under ambient conditions8 because the Voc of a solar cell is usually proportional to the difference between the LUMO level of the acceptor and the HOMO level of the donor.24 Importantly, PDTS-Ph-TTz also shows a good LUMO energy level, which is beneficial for the electron transfer from the polymer donor to PC71BM.
2.4 Photovoltaic properties
The BHJ solar cells were fabricated using the as-prepared polymer as the donor and PC71BM as the acceptor to investigate the photovoltaic properties of the polymer. The device configuration was ITO/PEDOT:PSS(40 nm)/active layer (∼90 nm)/with or w/o PFN (5 nm)/Al (100 nm). Firstly, the PSC devices were fabricated by spin-coating the active layers from CF solutions. Different weight ratios of the copolymer donor to PC71BM (1:1 and 1:2) were studied. The optimized D:A ratio was 1:1 for PDTS-Ph-TTz. The J–V curves of the PSC devices under solar illumination (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2) and in the dark are shown in Fig. 2a, with the deduced parameters summarized in Table 1. The polymer/PC71BM weight ratio of 1:1 showed a PCE of 0.99%. When the weight ratio increased from 1:1 to 1:2, the device gave an inferior PCE of 0.88%, which was mainly attributed to decreased Jsc. O-Dichlorobenzene (o-DCB) as spin-casting solvent was often chosen to prepare the active layers of the polymer: PC71BM blends. Therefore, we tried to use this high boiling point solvent to improve the photovoltaic performance. The optimized weight ratio of the PDTS-Ph-TTz and PC71BM was found to be 1:1. The polymer:PC71BM (1:1, w/w) blends just got the PCE up to 0.68%, which is far lower than the device processed with CB due to inferior FF.

It has been well-recognized that PFN could lead to better interfacial contacts through decreasing the series resistance, benefiting the enhanced electron collection of the cathode as well as the decreased possibility of hole-electron recombination in the active layer.11,38 Therefore, the PFN interlayer was used to further improve the PCE of the devices. As expected, inserting the cathode interfacial layer PFN caused much improvement in the performance of devices (Table 1). The CB processed device obtained from the PDTS-Ph-TTz:PC71BM (1:1) showed a PCE of 1.3%, whose PCE increased by 30% compared with devices w/o PFN. A similar phenomenon can be observed in the PDTS-Ph-TTz:PC71BM (1:2) device; the PCE increased from 0.88% to 0.95% when PFN was introduced as the cathode interlayer. When we used o-DCB solvent to process polymer:PC71BM blends, the values of PCE of the devices decreased from 0.99% to 0.85% as the weight ratios of PC71BM increased from 1:1 to 1:2 (Table 1). In all cases, the improved PCE was attributed mainly to the obvious enhancement in Voc. The observed enhancement of Voc could be revealed by the J–V characteristics of the devices in the dark (Fig. 2a and c). Compared with the devices based on an Al cathode, the dark currents of those devices with the interfacial layer PFN were found to be 1–2 orders of magnitude lower than those of the control devices (Fig. 2b and d).
The low device performance for devices processed from CF solution may indicate the poor solubility of polymer:P71CBM in CF. CB was explored as processing solvent due to its good solvation property and low evaporation rate, which allows the blend of polymer/fullerene to organize into an optimal microstructure. Fig. 2c shows the J–V characteristics of polymer/PC71BM devices processed using a mixed solvent of CB with 5 vol% DIO (1,8-diiodooctane).46 The effect of insertion of the PFN interlayer and methanol treatment of the active layer on device performance was studied for PDTS-Ph-TTz:PC71BM (1:1) devices (Table 2). The as-cast device structure was ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC71BM/Al. Devices fabricated using CB:DIO (95:5, v/v) mixture solvent exhibited significantly increased performance in comparison to those using CF. For example, the PDTS-Ph-TTz device obtained an increased PCE from 0.99% to 1.09% when changing the processing solvent from CF to CB + 5% DIO. The enhancement in PCE for devices processed from different solvents may be explained by the solubility of PC71BM and the morphology of the active layer. Compared with the as-cast devices, devices with the PFN interfacial layer showed much improved PCE from 1.09% to 1.56%, with Jsc increased from 5.42 to 6.54 mA cm−2.

It is noteworthy that the incorporation of the PFN interlayer was responsible for the improvement of PSCs. The active layer through simple polar solvent treatment could form fiberlike interpenetrating morphologies to harvest increased hole mobilities and more-balanced charge transport, which resulted in the simultaneous enhancement of device parameters of PSCs.44 We tried to employ methanol as polar solvent to optimize the performance of PSCs. Inspiringly, the device of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC71BM/Al with methanol exposure for the active layer exhibited a much increased PCE of 2.05% with Jsc increased from 5.42 to 6.47 mA cm−2 and FF from 33% to 52% in comparison to the as-cast device.
Solvent annealing of the active layer is well recognized to be able to enhance its light absorption and the hole mobility by inducing the self-organization of polymers, resulting in improved efficiency for PSCs.43 THF was hereby chosen as the low boiling-point solvent to study the effect of solvent annealing on device performance. The J–V curves of the PSC devices with THF annealing for 30 s under solar illumination (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2) and in the dark are shown in Fig. 3c, with the deduced parameters summarized in Table 2. The THF annealing device based on the structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC71BM (1:1)/PFN/Al achieved a much increased PCE of 2.14% (by 37% enhancement), with an increase in Voc from 0.56 to 0.60 V, a slight increase of Jsc from 6.54 to 6.86 mA cm−2 and an improvement of FF from 42% to 52%. These results indicate that the solvent annealing is effective to improve device performance, which is attributed to the healing of the disruption in the ordering of polymer donors induced by incorporating PC71BM molecules into the blend system.

Thermal annealing of the active layer has been often reported to induce the self-organization of the polymer while simultaneously increasing exciton loss as the domain size of nanoscale phase separation exceeds the exciton diffusion length of the conjugated polymers.47 The effect of thermal treatment on the device performance of our as-developed polymers was studied, with J–V characteristics shown in Fig. 4a and device data summarized in Table 3. Interestingly, PDTS-Ph-TTz based devices showed decreased performance when the active layers were subjected to thermal annealing. The results implied that thermal annealing had a significant negative effect on the performance of devices. The as-fabricated devices w/o thermal treatment delivered a PCE of 2.05%, while the PCE decreased to 1.54%, 1.55%, and even 0.87% after thermal annealing of the device at 70 °C, 90 °C and 110 °C for 5 min, respectively. During thermal annealing, the FF values of devices were found to decrease dramatically with the increment in annealing temperature. This may be explained by the fact that the formation of interpenetrating networks of nanoscale phase separation between the polymer and PC71BM was disrupted, resulting in decreased charge separation and poor compatibility between the polymer and PC71BM.

2.5 IPCE
The incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) of the solar cells was measured under the illumination of monochromatic light. Fig. 5 shows the IPCE curves of the best performing PDTS-Ph-TTz devices, which are also used to verify the measured Jsc values. The PDTS-Ph-TTz:PC71BM(1:1)/PFN/Al device processed using CB + 5 vol% DIO exhibited a broad response range covering 400–700 nm and a relatively high IPCE value above 30% in the region of 400–600 nm. It should be noted that the relatively low IPCE values of PDTS-Ph-TTz device agreed with its low Jsc values in PSCs.
 Fig. 5  IPCE spectrum of solar cells with the PDTS-Ph-TTz:PC71BM (1:1) system illuminated by monochromatic light. 
It should be noted that PDTS-Ph-TTz:PC71BM devices delivered slightly lower PCEs than the reported PSOTT and PSETT with alkyl on the bridging silicon atom.35 The reason may be explained by the lower Mn of PDTS-Ph-TTz, which is only one third of that of PSOTT. The molecular weight of polymers will significantly affect the hole transport along polymer chains and across the π–π stacked polymer backbones, which is reflected by the Jsc value in solar cells.1,3 The charge transport properties of the polymers were hence characterized with field-effect transistor (FET) devices. By adopting the same device structure and protocols,48c the hole mobility of an un-annealed PDTS-Ph-TTz device was calculated to be 4.1 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is almost one-magnitude lower than that of high Mn PSOTT. This is readily reflected by the 50% lower Jsc value of PDTS-Ph-TTz:PC71BM (1:1) solar cells than that of PSOTT:PC71BM (1:2) devices.35
2.6 Morphology
In order to gain more insight into the observed difference in device performance, tapping-mode atomic force microscopy (AFM) was employed to measure the surface morphological properties of PDTS-Ph-TTz:PC71BM blend films with different D/A weight ratios and processed using different solvents. When the active layer was processed by CF solutions, the domain size of PC71BM decreased with the increasing weight ratio of polymer/PC71BM from 1:1 to 1:2 and the globular clusters were replaced by much finer and more uniform morphology (Fig. 6b). The phenomena can be well explained with decreased root mean square roughness (RMS) (from 3.071 to 2.545 nm) as well as the increased FF (from 46.7% to 57.2%). The decrease of surface roughness and appropriate phase separation are responsible for the enhancement of the FF.46,47 When spin-coating the active layers from CB solution with 5% DIO additive, nanoscale phase separation was observed in PDTS-Ph-TTz/PC71BM (1:1) films although showing increased RMS (3.699 nm). The big difference in film morphology indicates that the active layer had better solubility in CB solution with 5% DIO than CF. The improved morphology of PDTS-Ph-TTz/PC71BM (1:1) film is in good agreement with enhanced Jsc for the devices.

3 Conclusions
A new 2D-conjugated polymer based on the DTS and TTz units with phenyl substitution on the bridging silicon atom of the DTS unit, PDTS-Ph-TTz, was designed and synthesized for further photovoltaic applications. The copolymer displayed good solubility and thermal stability. It was found that the phenyl substitution down-shifted the HOMO energy level by ca. 0.16 eV and 0.08–0.11 eV narrowed bandgap of the 2D-conjugated polymer in comparison to the corresponding polymers with alkyl substitution on the silicon bridge. The ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PDTS-Ph-TTz:PC71BM/PFN/Al device processed using CB solutions with 5 vol% DIO delivered a PCE of 1.56%. The device performance was further improved to 2.14% PCE with 30 s THF annealing of the active layer. Exposure of active layers to methanol was proved to be effective for device optimization. However, thermal annealing plays a negative role in the photovoltaic performance of PSCs, probably due to the serious aggregation and low compatibility between the polymer and PC71BM. The morphology studies revealed that polymer:PC71BM had better solubility in CB solution with 5 vol% DIO than in CF. Active layers processed from CB + 5% DIO exhibited nanoscale phase separation, which contributed to more efficient charge transfer to achieve higher Jsc and FF for the devices. The moderate PCE renders much room for improvement of the device performance of DTS based 2D-conjugated polymers via rational molecular design for side-chain engineering. Further work in increasing polymer Mn and screening stronger accepting units for D–A DTS polymers is in progress in our group to obtain enhanced performances for PSCs.
4 Experimental
4.1 Materials
All starting materials and reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Co. (Shanghai, China) and used without further purification. THF was dried over sodium/benzophenone and freshly distilled before use. 5,5′-Ditrimethylsiyl-3,3′-dibromo-2,2′-bithiophene 132 and TTz-Tin40 were synthesized according to previously reported procedures.

4.1.1 Synthesis of 4,4′-bis(phenyl)-5,5′-bi(trimethylsiyl)-dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]silole 2. 
Under a nitrogen atmosphere, to the stirred solution of compound 1 (5.1 g, 8.8 mmol) in anhydrous diethyl ether (40 mL) at −78 °C n-butyllithium (3.8 mL, 2.4 M in hexane) was slowly added. After 2 hours, the dichlorodi(phenyl)silane (2.58 g, 10.2 mmol) was added dropwise. The cooling bath was removed and the reactant was stirred for 2 hours under ambient temperature. THF (60 mL) was added to the reaction and refluxed overnight. The reaction was quenched by water. The resultant mixture was extracted with dichloromethane. The combined organic layer was dried (MgSO4) and concentrated in vacuo. The residue was purified by column chromatography on silica gel using petroleum ether to give the title compound as a yellow solid (3.2 g, 60%). 1H NMR (500 MHz, CDCl3, ppm) δ 7.66 (dd, J = 8 Hz, J = 1.5 Hz, 4H), 7.45–7.42 (m, 2H), 7.39–7.36 (m, 4H), 7.31 (s, 2H), 0.355 (s, 18H). 13C NMR (125 MHz, CDCl3, ppm) δ 155.59, 142.24, 141.74, 136.50, 135.48, 132.27, 130.19, 128.13, 0.15.


4.1.2 4,4′-Bis(phenyl)-5,5′-dibromo-dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]silole DTS-Ph. 
In the dark, to the stirred solution of compound 2 (1.27 g, 2.6 mmol) in anhydrous chloroform (40 mL) at 0 °C N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) (1.0 g, 5.84 mmol) was added in one portion. The reaction was stirred at ambient temperature overnight and then extracted by diethyl ether. The mixture was purified by column chromatography on silica gel using petroleum ether to give the title compound as a yellow solid (0.78 g, 62%). 1H NMR (500 MHz, CDCl3, ppm) δ 7.68 (dd, J = 8 Hz, J = 1.5 Hz, 4H), 7.54–7.53 (m, 2H), 7.47–7.45 (m, 4H), 7.35 (s, 2H). 13C NMR (125 MHz, CDCl3, ppm) δ 150.03, 139.29, 135.31, 132.15, 130.77, 130.33, 128.38, 112.44.


4.1.3 Synthesis of PDTS-Ph-TTz. 
DTS-Ph (242 mg, 0.22 mmol) and TTz-Tin (200 mg, 0.17 mmol) were dissolved in a mixed solvent of anhydrous toluene (5 mL) and DMF (1 mL). The mixture solution was purged with nitrogen for 15 min, and then Pd(PPh3)4 (12 mg, 0.01 mmol) was added. After being purged for another 15 min, the reaction mixture was heated at 105 °C for 48 h. Cooled to room temperature, the reaction mixture was added dropwise to methanol (200 mL) to precipitate the crude product. The collected solid was then subjected to Soxhlet extraction with methanol and acetone. Subsequently, the residue was washed with chloroform and concentrated using a rotary evaporator. By re-precipitating from methanol and drying in vacuo, the title polymer (220 mg, 70%) was obtained as a black solid. 1H NMR (500 MHz, CDCl3, ppm) δ 7.6–7.3 (br, 12H), 6.95–6.82 (2H), 4.10–4.05 (4H), 1.6–0.88 (br, 46H). Anal. cald. for [(C56H64N2O2S6Si)n]: C 65.97, H 6.52, N 2.75, S 18.87; found: C 65.96, H 6.50, N 2.70, S 18.80. GPC: Mn = 5.52 KDa, Mw = 6.18 KDa, PDI = 1.12.

4.2 Characterization

1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were characterized on a Bruker AVANCE 500 MHz (Bio-Spin Corporation, Europe) spectrometer with CDCl3 as the solvent and tetramethylsilane (TMS) as the internal standard. Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) analysis was measured on a Waters 717-2410 instrument with polystyrene as the standard and THF as the eluent (flow rate 1.0 mL min−1). Ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra were recorded on a UV-vis instrument Evolution 220. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was conducted using a TA instrument TGA/SDTA851e with a heating rate of 20 °C min−1 under nitrogen flow. Electrochemical cyclic voltammetry was conducted on an electrochemical workstation (CHI660D, Chenhua, Shanghai) with a Pt plate as the working electrode, a Pt slice as the counter electrode, and a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as the reference electrode in tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (Bu4NPF6, 0.1 M) acetonitrile solutions at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was recorded on a Dimension Icon AFM in the tapping mode.
4.3 Fabrication and characterization of polymer solar cells
The BHJ solar cells were fabricated with a device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS (40 nm)/active layer (∼90 nm)/with or w/o PFN (5 nm)/Al (100 nm). The ITO glass substrates were sonicated sequentially in deionized water, acetone, deionized water and isopropanol. Immediately prior to device fabrication, the substrates were treated using oxygen plasma for 4 min. Firstly, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)/poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT/PSS, H. C. Starck) thin film (40 nm) was spin-coated and then baked at 15 °C for 15 min. Secondly, the polymer:PC71BM (1:1 or 1:2 in weight ratio) blend active layer, with a nominal thickness of ∼90 nm, was spin-coated on top of PEDOT/PSS from a solvent of chloroform (CF) or mixed solvent of CB/DIO (97:5 vol%) (concentration, 10 mg mL−1) at 1000 rpm for 2 min. Thirdly, for the insertion of PFN, the PFN material was dissolved in methanol in the presence of a small amount of acetic acid and its solution was spin-coated on top of the obtained active layer to form a thin interlayer of 5 nm. For methanol treatment, after drying of the active layer under vacuum, methanol solvent exposure was carried out by spin-coating methanol on top of active layers at 2000 rpm for 30 s. For treatment of THF annealing, the devices before PFN/Al deposition were transferred to a glass Petri dish containing THF solvent and covered with a glass cap. After solvent annealing, the samples were dried overnight (>12 h) at room temperature in an N2-filled glovebox. The Al electrode (100 nm) was evaporated through a shadow mask to define the active area of the devices (2 × 8 mm2). The current–voltage (J–V) characteristics and PCE were measured using a Keithley 2400 sourcemeter under 1 sun, AM 1.5G spectrum from a solar simulator (Oriel model 91192) at room temperature in a nitrogen filled glovebox. Solar simulator illumination intensity was determined using a monocrystal silicon reference cell (HamamatsuS1133, with KG-5 visible color filter) calibrated by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL).
