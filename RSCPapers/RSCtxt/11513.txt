    , Accepted 8th February 2022First published on 9th February 2022AbstractIn the present work, a cobalt aluminum layered double hydroxide and its derivatives were synthesized via a hydrothermal method, an alkali-etching method and a phosphorization route to obtain different crystal phases. The structure, morphology and chemical composition of the four samples were characterized and their electrochemical performances were carefully investigated. All of them have a flower-like morphology, but their layered structures were destroyed after phase transition processes. The CoAl LDH electrode exhibited a superior capacitance performance of 983.1 F g−1 at 1 A g−1, a superior rate capability of 88.64% at 10 A g−1 and excellent cycling stability (92.68% retention after 5000 cycles at 10 A g−1), while the CoPx has a lower electrochemical performance than CoAl LDH. The CoAl LDH and graphene (GR) were constructed as asymmetric capacitors with an energy density of 16.29 W h kg−1 at a power density of 700 W kg−1, excellent coulombic efficiency (90.85% at 5 A g−1) and remarkable capacitance retention (82.84% after 10000 cycles). Among the four samples, CoAl LDH shows the best electrochemical performance due to its unique layered structure allowing more electrolyte ions for redox reaction. Hence, the influence of original metallic element diversification is higher than the influence of mono-metallic oxide modification on improving electrochemical properties, which provides a good reference for follow-up studies to screen preliminary materials for energy storage and conversion.
Introduction
To fulfil the rising energy storage demand from modern life and global environment, advanced energy storage and conversion devices like lithium-ion batteries, new fuel cells, solar cells and electrochemical capacitors have attracted intensive attention.1–4 Electrochemical capacitors, also called supercapacitors, are considered to be the most appropriate choice for next generation energy storage devices due to their larger power density, higher energy density, faster charge/discharge, long cycle stability and safety.5,6 For electrode materials, mono-metallic oxides and multi-metal oxides have been regarded as excellent candidates with merits of high theoretical capacitance, valence diversity, natural abundance, and environmental compatibility.7–9 To date, there is still a big gap between the actual specific capacitance and theoretical specific capacitance. Some researchers devoted themselves to modifying mono-metallic oxides and some devoted themselves to regulating multi-metal oxides. Their electrochemical properties are improved via sulfuration,10,11 phosphorization,12,13 or composite material synthesis.14,15 However, it is still not clear whether mono-metallic oxide modification or original metallic element diversification affects the improvement consequences of electrochemical properties more. Therefore, it is important to choose a material that can meet this research demand.
Layered double hydroxides (LDHs), as a newly developed electrode material from transition metals with marvelous 2D layered structures such as CoAl-LDH,16 NiCo-LDH,17,18 NiFe-LDH,19 NiAl LDH20 and NiMn-LDH,21 have been the focus of a good deal of studies in recent years. Among them, Al-based LDHs like CoAl LDH are optimal candidates due to aluminum (Al) being an amphoteric metal, which can be removed with an acid or alkali.22 Based on this characteristic, metallic element diversification can be easily regulated. After removal of Al, the remaining element (Co) can form a mono-metallic oxide and derivatives of the mono-metallic oxide can be further prepared by modification methods. Besides, modification methods like phosphorization have received attention from scientists.23,24 These strategies could well boost the intrinsic electrical conductivity and add a number of active sites. Mono-metallic phosphides like cobalt phosphide (CoP) are typical electrode materials with various synthetic methods and phase transition processes including phosphorization. Thus, metallic element diversification can be achieved via leaching Al by alkali etching, and mono-metallic oxide modification can be achieved via phosphorization in the same preparation route.
Herein, we introduce atomic scale modulation strategies which consist of an alkali-etching method and a phosphorization route to obtain different crystal phases and to prepare CoAl LDH and its derivatives. We immersed the flower-like CoAl LDH in a 6 M KOH solution for a long time to harvest the intermediate product CoOOH as the target for phosphorization. According to a series of methods, we obtain four materials including CoAl LDH, CoOOH, CoPx and e-CoPx. All the samples retain the flower-like morphology after the alkali etching process and phosphorization. For application in supercapacitors, the CoAl LDH exhibits the highest electrochemical performance due to its unique layered structure which can contain more electrolyte ions for intercalation/deintercalation. The CoAl LDH electrode material presented a superior capacitance performance of 983.1 F g−1 at 1 A g−1, a superior rate capability of 88.64% at 10 A g−1 and excellent cycling stability (92.68% retention after 5000 cycles at 10 A g−1). The as-assembled asymmetric supercapacitor (CoAl LDH//GR) device exhibited a maximum energy density of 16.29 W h kg−1 at a power density of 700 W kg−1, excellent coulombic efficiency (90.85% at 5 A g−1) and remarkable capacitance retention (82.84% after 10000 cycles). The results show that CoPx exhibits a lower electrochemical performance than CoAl LDH, which means that original metallic element diversification affects the improvement consequences of electrochemical properties more than mono-metallic oxide modification. This work not only provides atomic scale modulation strategies and the phase transition process from CoAl LDH to e-CoPx, but also reveals the importance of the structure and the electrochemical mechanism of CoAl LDH. It provides a good reference for follow-up studies to screen preliminary materials for energy storage and conversion.
Experimental section
All chemical reagents used in this work were of analytical grade and used without any further purification. Cobalt nitrate (Co(NO3)3·6H2O), aluminum nitrate (Al(NO3)3·9H2O), ammonium fluoride (NH4F) and urea (CO(NH2)2) were purchased from Alfa Aesar. KOH and sodium hypophosphite (NaH2PO2·H2O) were purchased from Chuandong Chemical (Group) Co., Ltd. (Chongqing, China).
Materials preparation

Synthesis of CoAl LDH. 
CoAl LDH nanosheets were synthesized by a facile hydrothermal reaction. 0.4 mmol Co(NO3)2·6H2O, 0.2 mmol Al(NO3)3·9H2O, 14 mmol urea and 2 mmol NH4F were added into a 50 mL Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave with 35 mL deionized water and stirred for 20 min. After that, the mixture was heated at 120 °C for 12 h. After cooling down to room temperature, the obtained products were collected and washed with deionized water 3 times by centrifugation at 5000 rpm repeatedly. Finally, they were dried at 60 °C for 8 h.


Synthesis and phosphorization of CoOOH. 
100 mg as-prepared CoAl LDH was added into a 250 mL beaker with 100 mL of a specially made 6 M KOH solution and stirred for 24 hours at room temperature. Then, the mixture was repeatedly centrifuged to obtain the brown sediment and dried at 60 °C for 12 h. 100 mg of CoOOH products and 500 mg NaH2PO2·H2O (mass ratio 1:5) were placed in separate flat-bottomed porcelain crucibles, with the NaH2PO2·H2O powders close to the upstream position of the tube furnace to produce PH3 gas. Before the heating process, N2 should be pre-agitated for half an hour to eliminate the internal air. The tube furnace was heated up to 300 °C at a ramp of 5 °C min−1 and maintained for 2 h under a N2 atmosphere to collect CoPx nanomaterials.


Alkali etching process of CoPx. 
After phosphorization, the cobalt phosphide was additionally treated with a second alkali etching with the same steps mentioned above and named as e-CoPx.

Materials characterization
The crystallographic information, morphology, structure and phase composition of the as-obtained products were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD, D/max 2500, Cu Kα), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Thermo ESCALAB 250Xi), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR, Nicolet iS5), transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM, Zeiss Libra 200), and focused-ion-beam scanning electron microscopy (FIB/SEM, Zeiss Model Auriga).
Electrochemical measurements
The working electrodes were prepared by a method presented in our previous work.25,26 A Hg/HgCl electrode was the reference electrode, and a Pt (1.5 × 1.5 cm2) electrode was the counter electrode. 6 M KOH was used as the electrolyte. The electrochemical performance of the electrodes after loading the active materials was measured by cyclic voltammetry (CV) at a potential window of 0–0.4 V with different scan rates, chronopotentiometry (CC) at a potential window of 0–0.35 V with different current densities and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) at a steady state open circuit potential in the frequency range from 100 kHz–0.01 Hz. The specific capacitance (C, F g−1) was calculated by eqn (1): (1)where I is the current (A), m is the mass loading of the active material (g), Δt is the discharge time (s) and ΔV is the potential window (V).
As for the two-electrode system, the negative electrode material was graphene (GR), and the positive electrode material was the synthesized CoAl LDH. The mass of the active material at the positive and negative poles is obtained by the principle of conservation of electricity as shown by eqn (2): q+ = q−, q = C × ΔV × m(2)
According to the principle of conservation of charge, the mass ratio of the positive electrode and the negative electrode can be calculated as eqn (3): (3)The specific capacitance (C, F g−1) of the two-electrode system is calculated the same as eqn (1). The power density (P, W kg−1) and energy density (E, W h kg−1) are calculated by the following formulae: E = (CV2)/7.2(4) P = 3600E/Δt(5)where m represents the total mass of the two electrodes and ΔV is the potential window.
Results and discussion
In order to understand the surface morphology and detailed features of the nanocomposites, SEM was performed as shown in Fig. 1. In Fig. 1a and b, the CoAl LDH has a nanoflower morphology formed by a lot of hexagonal nanosheets. The thickness of the CoAl LDH nanosheets is about 140 nm. After alkali etching of CoAl LDH, the obtained CoOOH as shown in Fig. 1c and d demonstrates an irregular nanosheet structure and maintains its original nanoflower shape. It seems that the unique layered structure of LDH was destroyed after removal of the metallic element Al, which decreases the active sites and is not beneficial for electrolyte ion reaction. Fig. 1e demonstrates the morphology of the CoPx nanostructure, which exhibits a similar structure to CoOOH. All the samples above relatively retain a good structure. However, after alkali etching of CoPx, the obtained e-CoPx as shown in Fig. 1f exhibits a collapsed structure, which is not suitable for a good electrochemical performance.

Fig. 2 presents the TEM and HAADF images of CoAl LDH and CoOOH to further observe their crystal structure and corresponding elemental distribution. As shown in Fig. 2a, CoAl LDH nanosheets can be clearly observed with different growth orientations. These nanosheets exhibit a flat and regular structure and the elements are distributed with Al, Co, and O (Fig. 2b). Fig. 2c shows that the CoOOH nanosheets have a rough surface and their morphology is irregular owing to the structure destruction by removal of the metallic element Al. The HAADF images in Fig. 2d indicate the uniform distribution of the Co and O elements in CoOOH, which proves that the element Al in CoAl LDH has been totally etched. Fig. S1 and S2† present the TEM images of CoPx and e-CoPx with their corresponding elemental distribution, respectively. Both of them retain a nanosheet morphology. The existence of the element P in the CoPx nanosheets indicates that CoOOH was completely a phosphate, and the nonexistence of the element P in the e-CoPx nanosheets demonstrates the successful transition synthesis from cobalt phosphide to cobalt hydroxide.

The crystal phases, functional groups and valence states of the CoAl LDH, CoOOH, CoPx and e-CoPx nanomaterials were analysed by XRD, FTIR and XPS. Fig. 3a presents the XRD patterns of the four samples above. The diffraction peaks of CoAl LDH were consistent with the hexagonal Co6Al2CO3(OH)16·4H2O crystal phase (JCPDS no. 51-0045).27 The three characteristic peaks at 2θ = 11.53°, 23.21°, 34.60° and 38.78° can be ascribed to the reflections of the (003), (006), (012) and (015) crystal planes, respectively. The (003) and (006) planes indicate the unique layered structure of CoAl LDH, which is advantageous for the reaction of electrolyte ions during the electrochemical process. After alkali etching of CoAl LDH, the blue line representing the heterogenite-type CoOOH sample presents some new diffraction peaks at 20.24°, 36.98°, 38.89°, 45.86°, 50.58°, 61.94°, 65.34° and 69.17°, which are assigned to the (003), (101), (012), (104), (015), (107), (110) and (113) crystal planes (JCPDS no. 07-0169),28 indicating the successful removal of the element Al from the lattice of CoAl LDH by alkali etching treatment. The orange line shows that CoPx consists of two crystal phases (CoP and Co2P). The CoP phase (JCPDS no. 29-0497)29 shows its characteristic peaks at 31.60°, 36.31°, 48.13°, 52.29° and 56.78° corresponding to the (011), (111), (211), (103) and (301) planes, respectively, while the Co2P phase (JCPDS no. 54-0413)30 shows these at 40.84° and 42.63° corresponding to the (111) and (021) planes, respectively. After a second alkali etching treatment, the e-CoPx sample exhibits two crystal structures. One is the same as the heterogenite-type CoOOH sample above, while another is the Co(OH)2 phase (JCPDS no. 30-0443),31 which has characteristic peaks at 19.06°, 32.47°, 37.92° and 51.36° assigned to the (001), (100), (101) and (102) planes, respectively.

Fig. 3b shows the FTIR spectra of CoAl LDH, CoOOH, CoPx and e-CoPx. The wide peak in the green line at 3400 cm−1 is ascribed to the bending and stretching vibrations of the –OH groups in H2O. The peak at around 1400 cm−1 is ascribed to the vibration of CO32− and the existence of CO32− is consistent with the XRD result of CoAl LDH.32 The sharp peaks at around 600 cm−1 in CoAl LDH, CoOOH and e-CoPx are assigned to the vibration of Co–O bonds,33 and CoPx has no Co–O bonds indicating the successful synthesis of cobalt phosphide. The C 1s high-resolution XPS spectra of CoAl LDH are shown in Fig. S3.† The three peaks representing C–C, C–O and CO are at binding energies of 284.8, 286.3 and 289.1 eV, respectively. Fig. 3c–f show the narrow XPS spectra to characterize the chemical states of the Co, O, Al, and P elements. Four energy peaks of Co 2p with binding energies of 781.1, 783.5, 797.3 and 799.3 eV are found in the high-resolution XPS spectrum (Fig. 3c), of which the two main peaks correspond to Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2, respectively.34 Besides, two satellite peaks at binding energies of 787.4 and 803.2 eV are also discovered in the Co 2p spectrum. Therefore, the Co element in CoAl LDH exists as Co2+ and Co3+. The narrow spectrum of O 1s in Fig. 3d includes three peaks located at 530.8, 531.7 and 532.4 eV, which are consistent with Co–O, O–O and adsorbed oxygen, respectively.35 Comparing the Al 2p spectra of CoAl LDH and CoOOH, a peak at 74.6 eV in Fig. 3e disappears after removal of the Al element, which also can demonstrate the successful synthesis of CoOOH.34 As shown in Fig. 3f, there are three peaks existing in the CoPx sample at binding energies of 129.6, 130.5 and 133.8 eV, which correspond to P 2p3/2, P 2p1/2 and P–O bonds, respectively.36 After a second alkali etching process, the P 2p narrow spectrum of e-CoPx has no peaks indicating the successful preparation of cobalt hydroxide. Therefore, the XRD, FTIR and XPS results show that the chemical composition of the four samples is consistent, which provide important chemical structure information for electrochemical analysis.
The electrochemical characteristics of the four Co-based samples with different chemical compositions were evaluated in a three-electrode system, as shown in Fig. 4. Fig. 4a shows the cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves of the CoAl LDH, CoOOH, CoPx and e-CoPx nanomaterials in 6 M KOH electrolyte. The CV curve of CoAl LDH clearly exhibits a pair of redox peaks at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1, indicating that the CoAl LDH material undergoes a Faraday redox reaction during the charging/discharging process. After phase transition, the CV curves of CoOOH, CoPx and e-CoPx are out of shape, and the integral area representing the value of specific capacitance decreases obviously. Fig. 4b shows the CC curves of the four samples at a current density of 1 A g−1, which have a quasi-triangular outline. The discharging time of CoOOH, CoPx and e-CoPx gradually shortens during these phase transitions. Fig. 4c presents the specific capacitance of the four samples calculated viaeqn (1). As summarized in Fig. 4c, the capacitance of CoAl LDH can reach 983.1 and 871.4 F g−1 as the current density increases from 1 to 10 A g−1 and be maintained at 88.64%, indicating the excellent rate performance of CoAl LDH. Similarly, the others exhibit a capacitance of 116.6, 531.4 and 64.3 F g−1 at 1 A g−1. Both of the capacitance and rate capability decrease in different degrees. Therefore, it is obvious that the structure–activity relationship is of great importance. Although phosphorization can improve the conductivity of nanomaterials,23 the electrochemical properties of CoAl LDH is still optimal after the phase transition process, which can be attributed to the advantage of its layered structure. And this proves that nanomaterials with multiple metal elements (CoAl LDH) play a better role than single metal compounds (CoOOH, CoPx and e-CoPx).

As depicted in Fig. 4d, the CV curves of CoAl LDH with different scan rates are presented, and show obvious redox peaks. These peaks shift with the scan rates increasing. Fig. 4e shows the CC curves of CoAl LDH with a quasi-triangular outline across a potential range from 0 to 0.35 V at 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 A g−1. Besides, Fig. S4–S6† show the CV and CC curves of CoOOH, CoPx and e-CoPx, respectively. The charge transfer resistances (Rct) of CoAl LDH, CoOOH, CoPx and e-CoPx are 3.72, 20.38, 5.07 and 7.40 Ω (Fig. 4d), which are fitted using the R[Q[R[Q[RW]]]] mode in the ZSimpWin software, respectively. CoAl LDH has the minimum charge transfer resistance and exhibits superior electrical conductivity. The phase transition and structure deformation make the number of active sites lower and the ion and electron transmission distance longer. Owing to the layered structure of CoAl LDH, the formation of ion-buffering reservoirs for more OH– improved the specific capacitance and cycling stability.37 To evaluate the electrochemical stability of the materials, the CoAl LDH and CoPx electrode materials were subjected to cycling at 10 A g−1. Fig. 4g presents the cycling performance of the two materials and the inset shows the last 10 cycles for CoAl LDH. After 5000 cycles, evidently, the capacitance retention of CoAl LDH and CoPx was sustained as 92.68% and 84.72%, respectively, indicating the outstanding cycle stability of CoAl LDH. The Nyquist plots of the 1st and 5000th cycles are shown in Fig. 4h. The Rct value of CoAl LDH in the 5000th cycle is 6.78 Ω, which is nearly twice that in the 1st cycle. The result proves that the conductivity of CoAl LDH deceases, which would in turn lead to the diminution of capacitance.
To assess the electrochemical type and capacitance contribution, CV curves at low scan rates were obtained at a potential window of 0–0.4 V as shown in Fig. 5a. The b value can be calculated by following eqn (6): LogIp = bLogv + Loga(6)

Fig. 5b shows the plots of logIpversus logv for the CoAl LDH electrode at low scan rates. Calculated from the peak current and scan rate, these anodic and cathodic peak points were linearly fitted to obtain the slope value of the two lines. The b value for the anodic peak equals 0.90635, while that for the cathodic peak equals 0.82791. On the basis of electrochemical type judgment,18 it is indicated that the CoAl LDH exhibits both battery-type and pseudocapacitance-type behavior owing to the value of b being between 0.5 and 1. Therefore, the energy storage mechanism of CoAl LDH is composed of the faradaic surface redox reaction and the non-faradaic electric double layer effect. The following equation (eqn (7)) determines the capacitance contribution:19 I/v0.5 = k1v0.5 + k2(7)where I (mA) is the current, v is the scan rate, and k1v is the current contribution from surface capacitive controlled processes. Fig. 5c–e show the surface capacitive contributions of the CoAl LDH electrode at a scan rate of 1, 3, and 5 mV s−1, which displays a 92.11%, 96.06%, and 98.42% capacitance contribution ratio, respectively. Fig. 5(f) presents the capacitance contribution ratio of the surface capacitance effect at different scan rates, in which the surface capacitance-controlled contribution ratio increases with increasing v.

To assess the practical application of the as-obtained material CoAl LDH, an asymmetric supercapacitor was constructed in an electrolytic cell using the CoAl LDH as the positive electrode, GR as the negative electrode and a 6 M KOH solution as the electrolyte. The CV curves of CoAl LDH and GR at a scan rate of 25 mV s−1 are shown in Fig. 6a. The mass ratios of the positive and negative active materials were calculated by the conservation of charge principle. To figure out the relatively optimal potential window, both CV curves at 50 mV s−1 and CC curves at 1 A g−1 were recorded as shown in Fig. 6b and c, respectively. With an increase in potential bias, the area of the CV curve and the specific capacitance also increased. However, when the potential bias was increased to 1.5 V, the current platform on the CV curve was reversed, indicating a conspicuous polarization. Thus, 0–1.4 V was finally determined to be the potential window for the next testing procedure. Fig. 6d presents the CV curves of the CoAl LDH//GR ASC across a range of various scan rates at a potential of 0–1.4 V. Quasi-rectangular patterns can be observed, which suggests the electric double-layer capacitance originating from CoAl LDH and GR. Fig. 6e shows the CC curves of the CoAl LDH//GR ASC. The specific capacitance of the ASC device was calculated using the CC curves. As shown in Fig. 6f, the specific capacitance is 59.86, 54.57, 51, 48.29 and 46.07 F g−1, respectively, which was maintained at about 78% when the current density was increased from 1 to 5 A g−1. Besides, its coulombic efficiency is 84.48, 88.02, 90.15, 90.86 and 90.85% at the assigned current densities. Thus, the ACS device exhibits an excellent rate capability and coulombic efficiency.

When the power density was 3500 W kg−1, the energy density of the CoAl LDH//GR ASC was sustained at 12.54 W h kg−1. Compared to other recently reported Co-based materials, such as CoMn LDH//AC,38 NiCo oxide//AC,39 Cu2O/CuO/Co3O4//AG,40 NiCo2O4/MnO2//AG41 and CoS/C//PCNFs,42 the CoAl LDH//GR ASC had a better performance. The long-term cycling properties of the CoAl LDH//GR ASC was evaluated at 4 A g−1. Fig. 6h shows that 82.84% capacitance was retained after 10000 cycles, which demonstrates the excellent cycling stability of the CoAl LDH//GR ASC device. The inset shows the CC curves for the last 10 cycles. Fig. 6i presents the schematic illustration of the two-electrode system charging device. Therefore, from the perspective of phase regulation, rational structure design of electrode materials is helpful to promote their macroscopic electrochemical properties. It turns out that the effect of metal diversification matters more than that of phase transition with single metal.
Conclusions
This study successfully introduces atomic scale modulation strategies to obtain different crystal phases and to prepare CoAl LDH and its derivatives. The preliminary material choice for CoAl LDH and the synthesis methods provide a comparison of mono-metallic oxide modification and original metallic element diversification. All the samples exhibit a nanosheet structure that form a flower-like morphology. For application in supercapacitors, the CoAl LDH electrode material presented a superior capacitance performance of 983.1 F g−1 at 1 A g−1, a superior rate capability of 88.64% at 10 A g−1 and excellent cycling stability (92.68% retention after 5000 cycles at 10 A g−1). The CoAl LDH exhibits the highest electrochemical performance due to its unique layered structure which can contain more electrolyte ions for intercalation/deintercalation. Compared with CoAl LDH, the results show that the others have lower electrochemical properties. This means that original metallic element diversification affects the improvement consequences of electrochemical properties more than mono-metallic oxide modification. The ASC device (CoAl LDH//GR) exhibited a high energy density of 16.29 W h kg−1 at a power of 700 W kg−1, excellent coulombic efficiency (90.85% at 5 A g−1) and remarkable capacitance retention (82.84% after 10000 cycles). This work can provide a good reference for follow-up studies to screen preliminary materials in the field of energy storage and conversion.
