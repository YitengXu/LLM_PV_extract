, Accepted 19th May 2015First published on 19th May 2015AbstractA nickel-based oxygen evolution catalyst, nickel-bicarbonate (Ni-Ci), was electrochemically deposited for varying intervals on the surface of W-doped BiVO4 in a 0.1 M bicarbonate electrolyte at neutral pH conditions. Optimally deposited Ni-Ci successfully catalyzed the photoelectrochemical water oxidation of W-doped BiVO4 photoelectrodes under benign pH conditions as evidenced by an enhanced photocurrent during photocurrent–potential characterizations. Efficient charge-transfer at the electrode–electrolyte interface in the presence of the Ni-Ci catalyst improved the kinetics of the W-doped BiVO4 photoanodes. The W-doped BiVO4 photoanodes integrated with a Ni-Ci oxygen evolution catalyst exhibited a large cathodic shift (∼371 mV) in the onset potential for water oxidation and maintained a stable photocurrent.
Introduction
One of the greatest challenges facing mankind is providing the world's population with sufficient energy for realizing the desired living standards.1 The development of inexpensive, renewable and clean energy competences is important to meet this energy demand against the backdrop of daunting carbon-neutral energy needs.2,3 The sun provides the Earth with abundant solar energy which has the potential to fully meet the energy demands.4,5 However, the diurnal variation of solar energy must be efficiently addressed in order for widespread realization of this renewable energy resource. The conversion of solar energy into fuel through a water splitting reaction using photoelectrochemical (PEC) cells is a promising solution and can effectively address this challenge. In PECs the water splitting reaction transpires at semiconductor/liquid interfaces.6 Interest in PEC processes stems mainly from the possibility of splitting water directly in to hydrogen compared to the photovoltaic based water electrolysis systems.7–9 A revival of interest in the PEC water splitting research area is focused on improving the efficiency through the proficient design and synthesis of inexpensive semi-transparent semiconductor photoelectrodes that absorb visible light, efficiently separate photogenerated charge carriers and exhibit good water oxidation kinetics. Among many candidates for PEC water oxidation, metal oxides are very effective as photoanodes for PEC water oxidation as the O 2p orbitals that constitute the formation of valence band are fixed at deeply positive potentials.10 In addition, metal oxides are primary choice for economically feasible electrode systems for PEC water splitting application as they are inexpensive, resistant to oxidization and stable in harsh conditions of oxygen evolution. Among various metal oxides, monoclinic bismuth vanadate (BiVO4) with an Eg value of about 2.3–2.5 eV has been investigated as a promising photoanode for water oxidation.11–14 The reasonable band-edge alignment with respect to water oxidation and reduction potentials along with its ability to absorb 11% of the solar spectrum represents BiVO4 as an attractive material for PEC water splitting application.15 Further, the water oxidation photocurrent for BiVO4 photoanodes under AM 1.5G solar illumination is estimated as high as 7.5 mA cm−2.15 However, BiVO4 photoelectrodes generate low water oxidation photocurrents most likely due to poor charge carrier separation efficiency, slow electron transport and slow charge transfer at electrode–electrolyte interface.16 Therefore, it is necessary to enhance the water oxidation performance of BiVO4 for further utilization in practice. In this regard, various strategies such as incorporation of dopants,13,17 modification of surface composition,14 design of heterojunction configuration,18–20 and creation of oxygen vacancies21 have been investigated to enhance the overall PEC water oxidation efficiency of BiVO4. In particular, tungsten and molybdenum have been extensively investigated as dopants at vanadium sites of BiVO4.13,22–26 Introduction of a small percentage of these dopants in the crystal lattice of BiVO4 enhances their electron densities and consequently induces significant changes in their electronic properties. Further, electronic structure analysis revealed that the effective mass of holes of doped BiVO4 is relatively reduced compared to that of undoped BiVO4.22 By means of DFT calculations, Ding et al. suggested that the substitution of dopant atoms into the BiVO4 lattice introduces surface oxygen quasi-vacancies.27 This would, in turn, enhances the adsorption energy for water molecules and improves the PEC water oxidation activity of doped BiVO4. Several methods such as metal–organic decomposition,13 chemical bath deposition,28 electrodeposition,29 hydrothermal30 and precipitation31 have been explored for the synthesis of BiVO4. Recently, a scalable spray pyrolysis method has been reported for the synthesis of W-doped BiVO4 and enhanced PEC water oxidation has been achieved.16 However, the photocurrents achieved from doped BiVO4 photoelectrodes are still restricted by the poor kinetics for water oxidation at the electrode/electrolyte interface.15,32 The water oxidation process requires removal of a total four electrons and four protons from two water molecules. This challenging task is the basis for poor reaction kinetics at the photoanode surface and requires high overpotentials to advance. This means that the photogenerated holes in the valence band of BiVO4 photoelectrodes are thermodynamically capable towards initiating the water oxidation but they are kinetically inefficient. Therefore, BiVO4 requires additional anodic bias to achieve significant improvement in the water oxidation activity. In order to overcome this issue, the activation energy required for the oxygen evolution needs to be reduced. This can be achieved via the utilization of oxygen evolution catalysts (OECs).33 In this approach, the light harvesting ability of a photoanode is combined with the water oxidation proficiency of a surface electrocatalyst leading to a composite photoelectrode. The integration of OECs minimizes the overpotential required for water oxidation by facilitating the charge transfer at the electrode–electrolyte interface. Recently, one of the authors reported the photo-assisted electrodeposition of cobalt phosphate via oxidation of Co2+ ions to Co3+ ions in an aqueous phosphate buffer medium of pH 7.13 Later, different OECs such as nickel borate (Ni-Bi),34 nickel oxyhydroxide (NiOOH),35 iron oxyhydroxide (FeOOH),36 RhO237 and PdO238 have been integrated with BiVO4 as OECs for enhancing the light driven water oxidation kinetics of BiVO4 photoelectrodes. In particular, Co-Pi and FeOOH OECs have been extensively investigated in combination with BiVO4 photoelectrodes in neutral electrolytes. However, Co-Pi is prone to degradation at high potentials39 and in poor proton accepting electrolytes.40 Furthermore, FeOOH OEC formation requires low pH (∼4.1) electrolytes36 while the Ni-Bi OEC formation requires high pH (∼9.2) electrolytes.34 These constraints impose the need for the development of new BiVO4–OEC interfaces that not only generate, function at neutral pH conditions and in the absence of proton abstracting electrolytes but also effectively enhance the water oxidation kinetics and durability of BiVO4 photoelectrodes. This development is crucial as it avoids harsh chemical environments.41,42 Recently, it has been reported that the presence of carbonate ions in the electrolyte significantly improves the PEC water oxidation performance of various oxide semiconductor electrodes.43–49 In addition, Joya et al., reported the self-assembly of nickel-bicarbonate (Ni-Ci) electrocatalyst on glassy carbon (GC) anode or indium tin oxide (ITO) surface via anodic electrodeposition from a Ni2+ solution with or without carbon dioxide saturation in a bicarbonate electrolyte under neutral pH conditions.50 It has been shown that Ni-Ci catalyst does not require the proton abstracting phosphate or borate buffers for electrodeposition and for anodic water oxidation as recently revealed to be essential for the generation and activity of Co-Pi and Ni-Bi based catalysts.51–53 Therefore, it is important to assess the catalytic ability of Ni-Ci OEC towards enhancing the water oxidation kinetics and activity of BiVO4 photoanodes. To the best of authors' knowledge, the electrodeposition of Ni-Ci OEC on a W-doped BiVO4 semiconductor electrode and its utilization as a co-catalyst in PEC water oxidation process has not been reported.
In the present work, electrodeposition of Ni-Ci OEC on 1 atom% W-doped BiVO4 (BiV0.99W0.01O4) in the absence of proton abstracting phosphate or borate buffers is investigated. The synthesis and characterization of the Ni-Ci/BiV0.99W0.01O4 photoelectrodes and the effect of Ni-Ci OEC deposition time on the PEC performance of the BiV0.99W0.01O4 are studied. The developed Ni-Ci/BiV0.99W0.01O4 photoelectrodes exhibited significant improvement in the oxygen evolution kinetics, water splitting photocurrent, onset potential, incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) compared to BiV0.99W0.01O4 photoelectrodes under neutral pH conditions, while also displaying stability.
Experimental section
The BiV0.99W0.01O4 thin films on F-doped SnO2 (FTO) (BiV0.99W0.01O4/FTO) employed in this study were prepared by modifying the spray pyrolysis method reported elsewhere.16 The precursor solution for the deposition of the BiV0.99W0.01O4 film was obtained from a mixture of solutions of Bi + V and W. Specifically, two separate solutions of Bi and V were prepared by dissolving Bi(NO3)3.5H2O (98% Alfa Aesar) in acetic acid (98% Sigma Aldrich) and VO(AcAc)2 (98%, Alfa Aesar) in absolute ethanol. The bismuth precursor solution was then added to the vanadium solution, and then the mixture was diluted to 8 mM with excess ethanol. To prepare BiV0.99W0.01O4 films, a stoichiometric amount of W(OC2H5)6 (99.8%, Alfa Aesar) dissolved in ethanol was added to the precursor solution of Bi and V, resulting in a solution comprising Bi/(V + W) in a 1:1 ratio. The obtained solution was spray coated onto a glass plate with a F-doped SnO2 overlayer (FTO) that were subjected to three successive 20 min ultrasonic cleaning treatments in DI water, ethanol and acetone respectively. The FTO plates were sprayed with the precursor solution at a 350 °C temperature. A layer of BiV0.99W0.01O4 film was deposited by spraying the precursor solution onto the substrate from a carrier gas of nitrogen (pressure, 0.6 bar) at a distance of 15 cm from the hot plate. A spray of 5 s was followed by a break of 55 s to allow for the pyrolysis of the newly sprayed layer and to reduce the temperature losses in the substrate. This process was continued until the desired number of BiV0.99W0.01O4 layers (typically 100 cycles) had been deposited. The as-deposited films were further subjected to annealing at 450 °C for 2 h in air to enhance the crystallinity. In order to compare the PEC performance characteristics of BiV0.99W0.01O4/FTO, an undoped BiVO4/FTO photoelectrode was prepared by following the above procedure with Bi:V ratio as 1:1 in the absence of tungsten precursor. An undivided three-electrode cell with a BiV0.99W0.01O4/FTO working electrode, Pt wire counter electrode, and Ag/AgCl (3 M KCl) reference electrode was employed for the electrodeposition of Ni-Ci. A thin layer of Ni-Ci OEC film was generated from a 0.1 M sodium bicarbonate solution (pH 7) containing 0.15 mM nickel(II) nitrate hexahydrate (99.9%, Alfa Aesar), while holding the potential of the BiV0.99W0.01O4/FTO electrode at 1.02 V vs. Ag/AgCl for 15–300 s. The resulting Ni-Ci/BiV0.99W0.01O4/FTO photoelectrodes were rinsed with copious amount of DI water and dried under a gentle N2 flow. The crystal structure of the as-synthesized BiV0.99W0.01O4/FTO electrode was determined from the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern collected from a Bruker D8 X-ray diffractometer using a Cu-Kα radiation. The UV-Visible diffuse reflectance spectra were recorded on UV-2400 UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectrophotometer. BaSO4 was employed as reflectance standard. Raman spectra of the as-synthesized BiVO4 films were collected using a Thermo Scientific DXR Raman microscope equipped with a 532 nm laser. The surface morphology of the as-synthesized BiV0.99W0.01O4/FTO electrode was analyzed using a Hitachi S-4800 scanning electron microscope. X-ray photoelectron spectra were obtained using a PHI 5600 model X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS) equipped with a monochromatic Al anode (1486.6 eV). The spectrometer was calibrated to the Ag 3d5/2 line at 368.27 ± 0.05 eV. The XPS spectra were recorded at 14 kV and 300 W with an analysis area of 800 μm2. The survey spectra were acquired at pass energy of 29.35 eV and the high resolution spectra were collected by a narrow scans at 23.95 eV. Spectra were charge corrected for the adventitious C1s line at 284.6 eV. The photocurrent action spectra were collected through a setup consisting of a 100 W tungsten lamp with a Photon Technology International (PTI) LPS-220 lamp power supply and an EG&G model 263A potentiostat/galvanostat (Princeton Applied Research). Light from PTI SIF-101 monochromator was chopped, and an optical filter was employed to block any second-order diffraction. The signal was detected using a Stanford Research Systems model SR830 DSP lock-in amplifier using the chopping frequency as a reference. A thermopile detector was located in the place of an electrochemical cell to measure the spectra output of the lamp and the monochromator. The voltage output from the thermopile is proportional to the incident power and it was plotted vs. photon energy. To obtain the photon flux from this plot, the photocurrent signal at each wavelength was divided by the energy (eV) of that wavelength. The semiconductor photocurrent spectrum was divided by the photon flux spectra to get a normalized spectrum. The photoelectrode was held at 0.7 V vs. Ag/AgCl (3 M KCl) and the photocurrent at each wavelength was measured in order to obtain a photocurrent action spectrum. The PEC responses of the photoelectrodes were obtained by illuminating the PEC cell with a 300 W Xenon (Newport) quartz lamp. A 55 mm diameter water filled filter was placed in the beam path between light and PEC cell to avoid the heating up of the solution due to IR radiation and the output light intensity of light passing through AM 1.5G filter was set to 100 mW cm−2 measured using Newport thermopile sensor 919P-003-10. The PEC measurements were carried out under ambient conditions in a three-electrode cell with a flat glass window using a Gamry® REF600 potentiostat interfaced with a computer. Ni-Ci/BiV0.99W0.01O4/FTO, BiV0.99W0.01O4/FTO, and BiVO4/FTO were employed as the working electrode; Pt wire and Ag/AgCl (3 M KCl) were employed as counter and reference electrodes respectively. A 0.1 M sodium bicarbonate aqueous solution (pH 7) was employed as the electrolyte for the PEC measurements. PEC measurements were performed by illuminating the photoelectrodes from the substrate–electrode interface in order to avoid competitive light absorption by the Ni-Ci films. Dynamic chopped light and steady state linear sweep voltammograms (LSVs) were scanned in the anodic direction at a scan rate of 15 mV s−1. For impedance analysis, alternating current (AC) impedance measurements were carried out at an applied bias potential of 0.7 V vs. Ag/AgCl within the frequency range of 10000 to 0.01 Hz and an AC voltage of 10 mV rms under AM 1.5 light in a 0.1 M sodium bicarbonate electrolyte (pH 7). IPCE measurements were carried out in a three-electrode setup, 0.1 M NaHCO3 aqueous solution (pH 7) electrolyte employing a 300 W xenon arc lamp (Newport Oriel), combined with a parabolic reflector, a collimated lens assembly, passing through an Action Research Corporation SpectraPro-150 computer controlled monochromator. Sample photocurrent data were normalized to the output of a calibrated silicon photodiode. For stability measurements, a bias potential of 0.6 V vs. Ag/AgCl was applied in a three-electrode setup and photoelectrodes were illuminated with calibrated AM 1.5G (100 mW cm−2) light from a 300 W xenon arc lamp (Newport) in 0.1 M NaHCO3 aqueous solution (pH 7).
Results and discussion
The crystal structure of the annealed BiV0.99W0.01O4/FTO electrodes obtained from spray pyrolysis method was analyzed by XRD (Fig. 1). The XRD pattern of BiV0.99W0.01O4/FTO electrodes shown in Fig. 1 exhibited strong peaks originating from FTO substrate along with the diffraction peaks of the BiV0.99W0.01O4/FTO films. The BiV0.99W0.01O4 films exhibited diffraction peaks fully corresponding to that of monoclinic scheelite type structure (JCPDS card no. 14-0688) indicating the absence of impurity phases, which is consistent with the previous study.26 The Raman spectrum of the BiV0.99W0.01O4/FTO photoelectrode is shown in Fig. 2A. The peak with highest intensity at 826 cm−1 and the shoulder peak at 717 cm−1 are due to the anti-symmetric and symmetric stretching modes of the VO4 tetrahedra, respectively. The bending modes of VO4 tetrahedra are evident from the peaks at 325 cm−1 and 366 cm−1. The Raman peaks at 129 cm−1 and 211 cm−1 are attributed to the vibration of crystal lattice. The vibrational modes of BiV0.99W0.01O4/FTO are in well agreement with the monoclinic scheelite BiVO4.54,55 The optical absorption spectrum of the BiV0.99W0.01O4/FTO (from 380–520 nm) as seen in Fig. 2B. The steep raise in the absorption profile of the BiV0.99W0.01O4/FTO film in the visible region is attributed to the transition at the band gap. The band gap of the BiV0.99W0.01O4/FTO photoelectrode was determined using photocurrent action spectroscopy and it was found to be 2.4 eV (Fig. S1†). Typical SEM images of the representative BiV0.99W0.01O4/FTO photoelectrodes that were obtained at different magnifications are shown in Fig. 3A and B. The as-synthesized BiV0.99W0.01O4/FTO films produced from spray pyrolysis method exhibited good adhesion and uniformity. The SEM images obtained for BiV0.99W0.01O4/FTO photoelectrodes clearly show that the grain sizes are in between 150–450 nm. Further, the surface morphology analysis of BiV0.99W0.01O4/FTO unveiled the existence of pores in the film. The presence of pores in the semiconductor photoelectrode films enhances the permeation of electrolyte through the pores and thereby improves the electrode–electrolyte interfacial area. This characteristic feature of porous electrodes aids the redox processes occurring at the electrode–electrolyte interface as the photogenerated holes will have to traverse less bulk material to be collected at the interface and thus reduces the chance of recombination before involving in the electrochemical reaction. The chemical composition of the as-synthesized BiV0.99W0.01O4 films was analyzed using XPS analysis. The high-resolution XPS spectra of the Bi 4f, V 2p, and W 4f binding energy regions for representative BiV0.99W0.01O4/FTO sample are shown in Fig. 4. The characteristic spin–orbit splitting peaks located 164.7 and 159.4 eV originating from Bi4f5/2 and Bi4f7/2 respectively confirm the presence of Bi3+. The split peaks located at 524.1 and 516.4 eV corresponding to that of V2p1/2 and Vp2p3/2 orbits respectively indicate the presence of pentavalent V.56 Furthermore, two characteristic peaks positioned at 35.1 and 37.2 eV originating from W4f7/2 and W4f5/2 signals respectively are assigned to the +6 oxidation state, confirming the presence of W6+ in the BiVO4 lattice.57 XPS characterization along with XRD analysis confirms the presence of monoclinic scheelite phase of BiVO4.

It is important to evaluate the photocurrent density and the onset potential for the photocurrent to assess the performance of a photoanode. The effects of tungsten doping and Ni-Ci catalyst integration on the photocurrent generation of the spray deposited BiV0.99W0.01O4/FTO photoelectrodes were investigated by examining the PEC responses of the BiVO4/FTO, BiV0.99W0.01O4/FTO and Ni-Ci/BiV0.99W0.01O4/FTO photoelectrodes in 0.1 M NaHCO3 (pH 7) electrolyte. Typical photocurrent vs. potential responses under chopped light illumination is shown in Fig. 5. BiVO4/FTO and BiV0.99W0.01O4/FTO electrodes exhibited anodic photocurrents upon illumination representing n-type character and the ability for water oxidation. The BiV0.99W0.01O4/FTO photoelectrode exhibited an improved photocurrent density of 0.84 mA cm−2 as compared to BiVO4/FTO (0.39 mA cm−2) photoelectrode at 0.6 V vs. Ag/AgCl in 0.1 M NaHCO3 (pH 7) electrolyte. This shows that photo-induced charge separation is effectively enhanced in BiV0.99W0.01O4/FTO photoelectrode. The incorporation of tungsten dopants into the crystal lattice of BiVO4 at vanadium sites provides extra electrons as it contains relatively more electrons compared to vanadium. This elevates the Fermi level, and the impurity levels will act as donor levels. Therefore, doping enhances the n-type conductivity of the BiVO4 which, in turn, improves the photogenerated charge carrier separation.17 Though the dopant incorporation improved the photocurrent density of the BiVO4, however, the magnitude of photocurrent achieved does not match the theoretically predicted photocurrents of BiVO4.16 The photogenerated holes accumulate at a higher rate compared to the hole participation rate in the electrochemical reactions near the electrode/electrolyte interface. This leads to poor charge transfer kinetics at the electrode–electrolyte interface. Therefore, it is essential to enhance the charge transfer kinetics at the electrode–electrolyte interface for the effective participation of accumulated holes at the interface of BiV0.99W0.01O4/FTO and to enhance the water oxidation activity. Integration of an OEC with the BiV0.99W0.01O4/FTO photoelectrode can unravel the implication of competing hole accumulation at the interface. Proton-coupled electron transfer process along with the change in the valence states of active metal of OEC during the water oxidation process facilitate the charge transfer kinetics at the electrode–electrolyte interface and improves the overall PEC water oxidation activity of semiconductor electrodes. The Ni-Ci OEC was integrated with BiV0.99W0.01O4/FTO by electrodeposition in Ni2+ containing bicarbonate electrolyte with the amount controlled by varying the electrodeposition time. Fig. 6 shows the chopped light I–V profiles of BiV0.99W0.01O4/FTO photoelectrode measured at various intervals of Ni-Ci OEC electrodeposition at 1.02 V vs. Ag/AgCl. The electrodeposition process leads to the formation of Ni-Ci films through the electrochemical oxidation of Ni2+ ions in the electrolyte. Ni-Ci OEC electrodeposition has significant effect on the photocurrent generation of the BiV0.99W0.01O4/FTO photoelectrode. Photocurrent of the BiV0.99W0.01O4/FTO photoelectrode gradually increased with the electrodeposition time until 300 s. However, the PEC water oxidation performance of BiV0.99W0.01O4/FTO was reduced significantly when the Ni-Ci OEC deposition time exceeded 300 s.

 Fig. 6  Effects of Ni-Ci electrodeposition time on the PEC characteristics of BiV0.99W0.01O4/FTO photoelectrode measured under AM 1.5 (100 mW cm−2) light irradiation in 0.1 M bicarbonate electrolyte (pH 7). 
The surfaces of Ni-Ci/BiV0.99W0.01O4/FTO electrodes generated at various intervals of electrodeposition process were analyzed using scanning electron microscope (Fig. 7). Shorter deposition times lead to the coverage of BiV0.99W0.01O4/FTO surfaces with thin films of Ni-Ci. Furthermore, the growth of Ni-Ci films increased with the deposition time. While, prolonged deposition for >300 seconds passivated BiV0.99W0.01O4/FTO photoelectrodes surface with large dendrites of Ni-Ci films and blocked the light absorbing sites of BiV0.99W0.01O4/FTO. The water oxidation reaction at electrode/electrolyte interface was facilitated by Ni-Ci OECs formed at shorter electrodeposition times as evident from the photocurrent enhancement (Fig. 6). This shows that the Ni-Ci catalytic active sites that were generated at shorter intervals of electrodeposition process have effectively improved the charge transfer at the electrode/electrolyte interface and reduced the charge carrier recombination. However, higher charge passed through the system at deposition times >300 s initiated the formation of dendritic films of Ni-Ci on the surface of BiV0.99W0.01O4/FTO. In this case, the photogenerated holes have to pass through a thick Ni-Ci film before participating in the water oxidation reaction and this would determine the charge transfer rate at the electrode/electrolyte interface. Consequently, it promotes the electron–hole recombination and reduced the water oxidation performance. Therefore, it is apparent that there is an optimum level of deposited Ni-Ci OEC to achieve enhanced PEC performance out of a Ni-Ci/BiV0.99W0.01O4/FTO photoelectrode. The anodic photocurrent of BiV0.99W0.01O4/FTO photoelectrode is improved by a thin Ni-Ci OEC loading with its effect more pronounced when the band bending is less significant. A significant enhancement in the photocurrent at low bias region is more encouraging since the high photocurrent at small bias potentials can potentially reduce the external power required to initiate the water splitting reaction and, therefore, enhances the overall solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency. The Ni-Ci OEC modification resulted in a ∼2.6 times enhancement in the photocurrent density (2.18 mA cm−2) as compared to unmodified BiV0.99W0.01O4/FTO photoelectrode (0.84 mA cm−2) measured at 0.6 V vs. Ag/AgCl. In addition, typical steady-state photocurrent vs. potential characteristics of Ni-Ci/BiV0.99W0.01O4/FTO and BiV0.99W0.01O4/FTO photoelectrodes measured under illumination conditions, shown in Fig. 8A, exhibited a negative shift of ∼371 mV in the onset potential for the Ni-Ci/BiV0.99W0.01O4/FTO photoelectrode as compared to the BiV0.99W0.01O4/FTO photoelectrode. This negative shift in the onset potential can be attributed to the catalytic ability of Ni-Ci. The presence of Ni-Ci OEC on BiV0.99W0.01O4/FTO not only alters the rate of charge transfer to and from the electrolyte but also the equilibrium and non-equilibrium interfacial energetics and thus reduces the overpotential. Further, the current–potential traces obtained under dark conditions, as seen from Fig. 8B, reveal a negative shift of ∼300 mV in the onset potential for oxygen evolution for Ni-Ci/BiV0.99W0.01O4/FTO compared to BiV0.99W0.01O4/FTO photoelectrode. This illustrates that the water oxidation kinetics of BiV0.99W0.01O4/FTO considerably improved upon the integration of Ni-Ci OEC. In contrast to Co-Pi, a notable OEC that has been widely investigated for enhancing the water oxidation kinetics of BiVO4 photoelectrodes,14 Ni-Ci proved be effective in the absence of proton abstracting electrolytes. Further, in favor of Ni-Ci system becoming a potential alternative OEC is the fact that nickel is more abundant compared to cobalt and is also cheaper than Co by ca. 49% in the metals market.58

In order to design an efficient photoelectrode with an optimum performance for PEC water splitting application, it is crucial to realize the nature of the catalytic active sites that are present on the surface of the Ni-Ci/BiV0.99W0.01O4/FTO photoelectrodes. Thus, XPS analysis was performed to obtain additional insight into the actual surface composition and chemical states of the Ni-Ci/BiV0.99W0.01O4/FTO photoelectrodes. The high resolution XPS spectra of the Ni 2p and C 1s binding energy regions for representative Ni-Ci/BiV0.99W0.01O4/FTO sample are shown in Fig. 9. The XPS analysis for the electrodeposited Ni-Ci/BiV0.99W0.01O4/FTO electrode exhibited the peaks corresponding to Ni 2p3/2 and Ni 2p1/2 signals at 855.2 and 872.5 eV respectively along with one shoulder peak at 861 eV. The precise examination of the Ni oxidation state is relatively difficult because of the existence of various oxidation states for nickel within a narrow binding energy range. The existence of Ni 2p peaks at 855.2 and 872.5 eV were attributed to Ni2+ and Ni3+ in nickel based OECs.34 Furthermore, the C1s spectra exhibited two peaks at 284.6 and 288.3 eV corresponding to carbon and carbonate compounds respectively, confirming that carbon exists as the form of CO32− on the surface.

In order to assess the dynamics of water oxidation, photocurrent vs. time measurements were executed on Ni-Ci/BiV0.99W0.01O4/FTO and BiV0.99W0.01O4/FTO photoelectrodes at 0.0, 0.2, 0.4 and 0.6 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) bias potentials, while the illumination was turned on and off (Fig. 10). The existence of spikes followed by slow photocurrent decay was observed in the photocurrent transients of BiV0.99W0.01O4/FTO photoelectrode at low applied bias potentials. These observations indicate the existence of surface recombination process in which initial hole accumulation at the electrode/electrolyte interface is followed by some amount of electron–hole recombination before a steady-state photocurrents are achieved. Integration of Ni-Ci OEC on BiV0.99W0.01O4/FTO photoelectrode diminished these spikes, indicating reduced surface recombination in the presence of OEC. Furthermore, enhanced photocurrents were observed for Ni-Ci/BiV0.99W0.01O4/FTO compared to BiV0.99W0.01O4/FTO photoelectrode. This suggests that Ni-Ci OEC integration relieved the charge accumulation and improved the water oxidation kinetics of BiV0.99W0.01O4/FTO photoelectrode. The improved PEC water oxidation performance of BiV0.99W0.01O4/FTO photoelectrode in the presence of Ni-Ci OEC can be attributed to the reduced charge carrier recombination and improved charge transfer kinetics at the electrode/electrolyte interface. The existence of Ni-Ci, as an oxygen evolution catalyst in the vicinity of BiV0.99W0.01O4/FTO can reduce the activation energy required for the water oxidation reaction by changing the reaction pathway. Ni-Ci can exert the photogenerated holes in the valence band of BiV0.99W0.01O4/FTO to drive Ni2+/3+ → Ni4+ → Ni2+/3+ circular catalytic reactions, accompanied by the quick release of the holes from BiV0.99W0.01O4/FTO surface for further participation in the electrochemical reaction (i.e., water oxidation).

Impedance measurements of Ni-Ci/BiV0.99W0.01O4/FTO and BiV0.99W0.01O4/FTO photoelectrodes in a three-electrode configuration under AM 1.5G (100 mW cm−2) irradiation were performed to understand the charge-transfer resistance characteristics. Fig. 11 shows complex impedance data represented in Nyquist plots for BiV0.99W0.01O4/FTO photoanode before and after Ni-Ci deposition. The impedance data is composed of an imaginary part (Z′) formed by the capacitance of the sample, and a real part (Z′′) formed by the resistance. Each point generated in the semicircle of the Nyquist plot is measured at different frequency at 0.7 V vs. Ag/AgCl applied potential. The Nyquist plot typically represents a semicircle-like characteristic in its complex plane when the charge transfer resistance in a kinetics-controlled process mainly determines the electrode impedance.59 The exchange of majority carriers through the interface is represented by the Nyquist plot whose nature confirms the prevalence of the bulk contribution. Herein, the proposed equivalent circuit, as shown in the inset of (Fig. 11), has been applied to fit the EIS experimental data obtained in the electrochemical process for BiV0.99W0.01O4/FTO photoelectrode. The fitting profiles are presented as solid lines and the experimental data are presented as individual data points. It is well established that the response at high frequency can be attributed to the charge transfer at the electrode/electrolyte interface, while the response at low frequency can be associated with the Warburg diffusion process in the electrolyte.60,61 The fitted equivalent circuit was expedient to understand the underlying mechanisms for charge transport in different electrolytes. Notably, the series resistance (Rs), the Warburg diffusion resistance in the electrolyte (Ws), and the charge transfer resistance at electrode/electrolyte interface (Rct) exhibited strong dependencies on the presence or absence of Ni-Ci OEC. The Ni-Ci integration with that of a BiV0.99W0.01O4/FTO photoelectrode resulted in a smaller semicircle compared to that of unmodified BiV0.99Wo0.01O4/FTO photoelectrode. The measured Rct values for Nyquist plots of BiV0.99W0.01O4/FTO photoelectrode from the model fits were found to be 389.5 and 556.7 Ω cm2 in the presence and absence of Ni-Ci OEC respectively. The reduced Rct indicates that the charge transfer at the electrode/electrolyte interface has been significantly improved in the presence of Ni-Ci OEC. Chatchai et al. observed similar effect of enhanced charge transfer at the electrode/electrolyte for photoelectrodes modified with catalyst species.18 The improved hole transfer rate in turn enhances the charge carrier separation and such an effect may reflect in higher photocurrent densities for Ni-Ci/BiV0.99W0.01O4/FTO photoelectrodes as seen in Fig. 6.

To investigate the Ni-Ci OEC effect in detail, the incident photon-to-current efficiencies for the BiV0.99W0.01O4/FTO and Ni-Ci/BiV0.99W0.01O4/FTO were measured in 0.1 M bicarbonate electrolyte at 0.6 V vs. Ag/AgCl (Fig. 12). The IPCE spectrum of Ni-Ci OEC modified BiV0.99W0.01O4/FTO photoelectrode exhibited similar characteristic features as that of unmodified BiV0.99W0.01O4/FTO photoelectrode, indicating the photoresponse is from the BiV0.99W0.01O4/FTO and not from the Ni-Ci itself. The Ni-Ci/BiV0.99W0.01O4/FTO photoelectrode exhibited enhanced IPCE values under the entire functional wavelength region over the BiV0.99W0.01O4/FTO photoelectrode. This infers that the Ni-Ci OEC effectively improved the photoinduced charge transfer kinetics and efficiency of the BiV0.99W0.01O4/FTO photoelectrodes. The obtained IPCE performance of Ni-Ci/BiV0.99W0.01O4/FTO photoelectrode (44% measured under an applied bias of 0.6 V vs. Ag/AgCl), at 440 nm is higher or close compared to the IPCE values reported for Ni-Bi/BiVO4 (28% at 0.48 V);34 Co-Pi/W-doped BiVO4 (38% at 0.9 V);25 RhO2/Mo-doped BiVO4 (46% at 0.44 V);37 NiO/Mo-doped BiVO4 (6.5% at 0.5 V);62 FeOOH/BiVO4 (44% at 0.6 V);36 Au/BiVO4/WO3 (10% at 0.4 V);18 WO3/Mo-doped BiVO4 (17% at 0.6 V);63 and BiVO4/WO3 (33% at 0.7 V).20

Finally, in order to investigate the long-term durability of Ni-Ci/BiV0.99W0.01O4/FTO, the photoelectrode was kept under continuous illumination at 0.6 V vs. Ag/AgCl in 0.1 M bicarbonate electrolyte over 24 h and multiple chopped light current vs. potential scans were performed at different intervals. The current vs. time (chronoamperometry) data obtained after 24 h of continuous illumination is shown in Fig. S2.† The illumination was chopped briefly after 24 h of continuous illumination and retained. The photocurrent almost retained its original value at zero hrs of illumination, indicating the stability of the Ni-Ci/BiV0.99W0.01O4/FTO, the photoelectrode. Fig. 13 shows the chopped light current vs. potential scans for Ni-Ci/BiV0.99W0.01O4/FTO photoelectrodes performed before and after 24 h of durability test. The Ni-Ci/BiV0.99W0.01O4/FTO photoelectrode maintained a stable photocurrent after 24 h of continuous illumination. This illustrates that Ni-Ci/BiV0.99W0.01O4/FTO photoelectrodes are fairly stable under photolysis conditions and Ni-Ci OEC aids the transport of photogenerated holes generated on BiV0.99W0.01O4/FTO photoelectrode towards desired water oxidation reaction.

Conclusions
The study successfully demonstrates that Ni-Ci can catalyze photoelectrochemical water oxidation of BiV0.99W0.01O4 under benign conditions (AM 1.5, 1 Sun, and pH 7). The Ni-Ci catalyzed BiV0.99W0.01O4 photoelectrode has exhibited a photocurrent density of 2.18 mA cm−2 at 0.6 V (vs. Ag/AgCl). Modification of BiV0.99W0.01O4 photoelectrode surface with Ni-Ci OEC led to ∼371 mV cathodic shift in the onset potential for PEC water oxidation without the use of noble metals or strong acids/bases. The Ni-Ci modification also shifted the onset of oxygen evolution potential in negative direction by ∼300 mV. The Ni-Ci/BiV0.99W0.01O4 photoelectrodes not only generated sustainable photocurrent for water oxidation but also maintained stability. The results presented here demonstrate that Ni-Ci largely eliminates a major performance constraint of W-doped BiVO4 photoanodes by facilitating the charge transfer at the electrode–electrolyte interface.
