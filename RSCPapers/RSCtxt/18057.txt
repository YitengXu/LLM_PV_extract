    , Accepted 26th July 2016First published on 27th July 2016AbstractOrganolead halide perovskite materials open up a new era for developing low-cost and high efficiency solar cells due to their simple and inexpensive fabrication process, superior light absorption coefficient, and excellent charge mobility. In addition to solar cells, hybrid perovskites have also seen dynamic advances with rapidly expanded applications to many other exciting fields including electronic and optical devices. Here, we demonstrate a new type of bifunctional resistive switching memory device based on a very simple bilayer structure of Ag and a CH3NH3PbI3−xClx perovskite material on an FTO substrate with both digital and analog resistive switching characteristics. The bi-stable resistive switching behavior with reliable endurance over 103 times and a retention time of 4 × 104 s demonstrates that the Ag/CH3NH3PbI3−xClx/FTO device can be a promising candidate for RRAM. In the low voltage sweeping region, surprisingly, analog resistive switching behavior with potentiation and depression characteristics was also observed, which can be useful in neuromorphic computing device applications. The possible Ag conducting filaments formed by redox reactions of the Ag electrode may play a key role in this newly observed resistive switching phenomenon.
1. Introduction
Organolead halide perovskite materials have been dynamically investigated for a wide range of potential applications including photovoltaic (PV) solar cells, light-emitting diodes (LEDs), field-effect transistors (FETs), solar rechargeable batteries and memory devices over the past few years.1–3 Among the hybrid perovskite materials, CH3NH3PbI3−xClx has drawn much attention due to its simple fabrication process, well-optimized film morphology, and extremely long carrier diffusion lengths.4–6 For example, a solar cell power conversion efficiency of up to 17.91% was achieved using CH3NH3PbI3−xClx as the light absorber.7 FETs with balanced electron and hole transport mobility of ∼1 cm2 V−1 s−18 and bright solid state LEDs were also developed based on this material.3
Very recently we reported a new resistive switching (RS) property for this perovskite material based on a simple Au/CH3NH3PbI3−xClx/FTO structure for resistive random access memory (RRAM) applications.9 RRAM devices based on the RS behavior are attractive candidates for next generation nonvolatile memory due to their low power consumption, simple structure, and high memory density.10,11 RS memory is based on bi-stable and multi-stable switchable resistance states named RS behavior, which has been interpreted to be caused by many types of switching mechanisms, e.g. charge trapping,12 phase transition,13 and filament formation.14 In RS memory devices, the universal design has a capacitor like structure with a switching layer between the top and bottom electrodes, in which various electrodes can be used.15,16 In particular, there are a number of reports on the RS mechanism depending on the species of metal electrode in the RRAM device with a metal/insulator/metal structure.15,17 Inert electrodes (IEs, e.g., Au, Pt, W) and active electrodes (AEs, e.g., Ag, Cu, Ni) have been intensively studied. Inert metal electrodes mainly act as the transport paths for carriers and counter-electrodes for reduction with no contribution to the RS behavior.18 However, active metals can directly influence the RS behavior via electrochemical reactions of the electrodes as well as the role of the transport paths for carriers.19–21 In the case of active metal electrodes (AEs), the RS behavior may be associated with the formation and rupture of the conducting filament (CF) comprising active metal atoms where the active metal atoms ionized at the AE diffused to the counter-electrode, and are subsequently reduced in the insulator layer when a positive bias is applied to the AE. Some studies on ZnO nanowire based RS memory devices have exemplified the variation of the RS mechanism, depending on the species used for the metal electrodes.22,23 Thus, it is of great interest to explore the RS behavior and mechanism if we change the metal electrode from inert Au to an active metal in the metal/CH3NH3PbI3−xClx/FTO device structure. Besides, the extra control parameters, such as the magnetic field, light, and compliance current, contribute to the change in RS behavior.24–26 Light controlled RS behavior in various materials such as oxide based perovskite and binary metal oxides has been widely investigated.27,28 Organolead halide perovskite is well known for its extraordinary light absorbing properties.29 Thus, it is expected that light controlled RS behavior could be observed in organolead halide perovskite. Recently, Z. Xiao et al. reported a switchable photovoltaic effect based on the ferroelectric effect in organolead halide perovskite materials, which is induced by ion drift in the perovskite layer under sunlight illumination.30 However, the influence of light illumination on RS based non-volatile memory devices based on organolead halide perovskite materials has not been studied yet.
Here we demonstrate resistive switching characteristics based on the device structure of Ag/CH3NH3PbI3−xClx/FTO. Surprisingly, the device not only exhibits digital switching behavior as we expected, but also demonstrates analog switching features, which have attracted intense recent research interest for neuromorphic computing device applications.31,32 It is also shown that the RS performance of our device is influenced by light illumination. We conducted detailed studies to understand the bi-functional switching behavior in this simple device and proposed a model to explain the underlying mechanism.
2. Experimental details
2.1 Materials and device fabrication
CH3NH3PbI3−xClx as a switching layer was prepared by using a simple solution method. The preparation method of CH3NH3PbI3−xClx solution can be found in the ESI.†
To fabricate the device, the FTO substrate (FTO22-7, Yingkou OPV Tech New Energy Co. Ltd) was cleaned using acetone, ethanol and isopropanol, and then dried using N2 gas. An FTO layer with a low sheet resistance of ∼7 Ω □−1 was used as a bottom electrode in our devices. Then the substrates were cleaned by oxygen plasma (RIE, ATX-600, 30 W) for 10 min before the next step. The CH3NH3PbI3−xClx perovskite solution was dispensed onto the FTO substrates and spin-coated at 1000 revolutions per minute (RPM) for 30 s in air at a 200 RPM s−1 ramping rate. After the spin coating process, we annealed the sample at 100 °C for 120 min on a hotplate in air to remove the residual solvents and induce crystallization of the perovskite. Finally, the devices were completed by Ag coating using the magnetron sputtering technique (AJA ATC-2200 system).
2.2 Measurements
Cross-sectional images of the device were obtained by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, JEOL 7100). The current–voltage (I–V) properties of the device were measured using a CHI 660D electrochemical workstation. A bias voltage was applied to the Ag top electrode with the FTO bottom electrode grounded. To confirm the light-controlled RS behaviors, we also investigated the I–V characterisitcs of the device under the illumination of 1 sun AM 1.5 simulated sunlight (100 mW cm−2).
3. Results and discussion
A schematic of the device and the measurement configuration is described in Fig. 1(a). The device has a simple structure consisting of a switching layer of CH3NH3PbI3−xClx between an Ag top electrode and an FTO bottom electrode on a glass substrate as shown in Fig. 1(b). Apparently, the CH3NH3PbI3−xClx layer has a uniform thickness without pinholes, and is distinguishable from the FTO and the Ag electrode (refer to Fig. S1 in ESI†). The elemental composition and crystallization of the perovskite film were verified by XPS and XRD results as shown in Fig. S2 and S3 (ESI†). Fig. 2(a) presesnts the I–V curve of the Ag/CH3NH3PbI3−xClx/FTO device in semi-log scale. By sweeping the voltage in the following order: 0 V → 3 V → −3 V → 0 V, the measured I–V curve shows bipolar resistive switching behavior. When a positive bias is applied to the Ag electrode, a sudden increase in current occurs and the resistance state of the device changes from a high resistance state (HRS, off state) to a low resistance state (LRS, on state), which is named as a “SET” process. Whereas, when a negative voltage is biased, the device recovers its HRS, which is named as a “RESET” proces. We conducted an endurance test of the device by performing the set/reset operation 103 times with a readout voltage of +1.4 V in dc sweeping mode [Fig. 2(b)]. We also measured the I–V characteristics at different bias voltage sweeping speeds as shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†). It was observed that the SET voltage tends to decrease with slower scan rate because the ion migration depends on the scan rate.33 In addition to the endurance, data retention is also an important factor in memory applications. As shown in Fig. 2(c), the HRS and LRS values measured at 1.4 V are almost unchanged over the time period of 4 × 104 s. This is comparable to a recent result which reported an organic–inorganic perovskite memory device with a retention time of 104 s.34 We can roughly predict that the device will operate stably over 10 years by extrapolating the retention test results in Fig. 2(c). Because there is a report on the chemical reaction of an Ag electrode with hybrid perovskite and the resultant drop in the power conversion efficiencies of the hybrid perovskite based solar cell,35 we checked the long term stability of our device by measuring the I–V curves 2 weeks or 1 month after device fabrication. As shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†), similar RS behaviours were observed, irrespective of the measurement moment. To confirm the uniformity, the RS behavior was measured randomly at 10 points of the device. It is revealed that the SET/RESET voltage and the current value exhibit almost identical values regardless of the measurement point as shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†). For potential practical application of the device as data memory, the SET/RESET operation should be examined by applying a bias in pulse mode. As schematically illustrated in Fig. 3(a), we applied a pulse type bias of +2 V (set) or −2 V (reset) alternately and measured the current at +1.4 V with a time delay of 10 μs after each voltage pulse stimulation. As indicated in Fig. 3(a), the HRS and the LRS are considerably stable under pulse mode operation for up to 3 × 104 cycles, indicating good uniformity of the switching behavior. Fig. 3(b) exhibits the retention charateristics in pulse mode operation. The successive measurement after the SET or the RESET pulse with a time interval of 10 min reveals that the resistance state is preserved for 6 × 103 s. These results indicate that the Ag/CH3NH3PbI3−xClx/FTO device can be potentially used in nonvolatile memory devices. It is important to understand the resistive switching mechanism of the Ag/CH3NH3PbI3−xClx/FTO device and we speculate that the behavior could be associated with the formation and the rupture of conducting Ag filaments in the perovskite layer.36 When a positive bias is applied to the active Ag top electrode in our device, Ag atoms can be dissolved in the switching layer as Ag cations, which subseqently diffuse towards the bottom FTO electrode and are reduced to Ag atoms. The reduction of Ag cations is promoted by the electrons which are thermally generated or externally injected through the FTO bottom electrode. In this case, Ag filaments start to grow near the top electrode if the mobility of the Ag cations is low.37 As we increase the bias voltage, the Ag filaments could further grow to bridge the top electrode and the bottom electrode, consequently the resistance state of the device changes from the HRS to the LRS. In contrast, when a negative voltage is applied, the conducting Ag filaments are abruptly ruptured by Joule heating and the resistance state of the device recovers to the HRS [Fig. 4]. In order to further verify the conduction mechanism, we replotted the I–V curve on a double-log scale as shown in Fig. 4. In the HRS, the fitting results indicate that the charge transport behavior follows a typical trap-controlled SCLC mechanism,38 consisting of an ohmic region (I ∝ V), a Child's law region (I ∝ V2), and a sudden current increase region. In the low voltage region ranging from 0 to 0.4 V, the conduction is dominated by thermally generated free elecetrons trapped in CH3NH3PbI3−xClx. In this region, all trap sites may not be filled due to the weak injection of electrons from the bottom electrode and this results in ohmic conduction. When the bias voltage is increased from 0.4 V to 1.4 V, the injected electrons dominate the conduction mechanism. The trapping and detrapping of injected electrons by the inherent defects in CH3NH3PbI3−xClx. make the current flow proportional to the square of the bias voltage, which is described in the inset of Fig. 5(a). This phenomenon is similar to the RS behavior of a Au/CH3NH3PbI3−xClx/FTO structure where Au (inert metal) is used as the top electrode,9 in which the electrons and trap sites in the CH3NH3PbI3−xClx layer only contribute to the conduction mechanism without any other factor like metal filament formation (see Fig. S7 in ESI†). Through the above results, we anticipate that the conduction mechanism is mainly associated with the movement of thermally generated or externally injected electrons until the current suddenly increases. In the sudden current increase region, the conduction mechanism might be explained by trap-filled SCLC or conduction through Ag filaments. If trap-filled SCLC dominates the transport, SCLC, Poole–Frenkel emission, and ohmic conduction are sequentially observed in the LRS when the bias voltage decreases, as observed in the Au/CH3NH3PbI3−xClx/FTO structure. However, the charge carrier transport behavior shows ohmic conduction in the LRS with a slope of 1.1. Fig. 5(b) further supports that the RS is caused by conducting filament formation/rupture. While the resistance value in the LRS is independent of the device cell size, the HRS of the device is proportional to the cell size. The size independent property of the LRS is generally observed in conducting filament based memory devices.39 Furthermore, we measured the I–V characteristics at different temperatures, in which the resistance in the LRS increases linearly with temperature from 300 K to 370 K [Fig. S8, ESI†]. It is well known that these phenomenona are typically observed in RS originating from conducting filament formation/rupture.40–42 In addition, no change in the resistance state was observed when a negative bias was applied to the Ag electrode first as shown in Fig. S9 (ESI†). As mentioned above, to form the Ag conducting filament, the Ag atoms at the electrode should be changed to Ag ions which then migrate into the perovskite layer. Hence, the RS behavior caused by the conducting filament is exhibited only when a positive bias is applied to the Ag top electrode first. This result supports that Ag filament formation mainly contributes to the switching mechanism in our device.

Because CH3NH3PbI3−xClx is well known for its photo-responsivity, it is expected that the RS property could be tuned by light illumination.29 When the device is exposed to 1 sun AM 1.5 simulated sunlight (100 mW cm−2), the SET/RESET voltage considerably decreases from around ±1.5 V (Fig. 1(b)) to ±0.3 V (Fig. 7(a)). This change could be explained by the generation of excessive charge carriers upon the exposure of the device to light. As CH3NH3PbI3−xClx has a direct bandgap energy of ∼1.55 eV,43 the exposure of the device to light leads to electron–hole pair generation. Before applying a voltage to the device, the excited electrons, which have been generated inside CH3NH3PbI3−xClx under light illumination, move to the Ag electrodes in response to a mismatched bandgap between the two electrodes [Fig. 7(b)]. Some of these excited carriers recombine and the others are trapped by defect sites inherent in CH3NH3PbI3−xClx. When an external bias is applied to the device, the trap sites can be filled very quickly by these photogenerated electrons and the injected electrons. Consequently the Child's law region (I ∝ V2) instantly appears without the ohmic region (I ∝ V) in the low voltage region as shown in the inset of Fig. S10 (ESI†). From these results, we can deduce that photogenerated electrons contribute to the relatively low operating voltage with rapid formation of conducting filaments.

(b) Energy diagram of the Ag/CH3NH3PbI3−xClx/FTO device and the movement of excited electrons under light illumination. 
Very interestingly, the current consecutively increases or decreases under a repeated voltage sweep of 0 → + 0.5 → 0 V and 0 → −0.5 → 0 V, respectively, as shown in Fig. 6(a) and (b). This kind of resistance change behavior is a characteristic of analog type switching, distinguishable from digital type switching showing an abrupt change in the resistance state from the HRS to the LRS under 0 → 3 → −3 → 0 V sweeping. As mentioned above, digital type switching occurs by the formation and abrupt rupture of Ag filaments, where conducting filaments completely bridge the top and the bottom electrodes. On the other hand, the repetitive sweeping of a bias voltage under 0.5 V is not enough to form a conducting filament bridge consisting of Ag atoms. Instead, Ag atoms can be gradually accumulated from the interface between the Ag electrode and the perovskite layer. As shown in Fig. S10 (ESI†), the conducting filaments can be grown by the accumulated Ag atoms, leading to a decrease in the effective gap between the electrodes. Because the Ag filaments are not dissolved unless a negative bias is applied, the Ag filaments tend to maintain their original shape even when we decrease the bias voltage to 0 V. Therefore, when a bias voltage of +0.5 V is applied repeatedly, it can be expected that the gap between the top and the bottom electrodes decreases and the lateral size of the conducting filaments increases, which lead to an increase in the current flow.44 This tendency is clearly shown in Fig. 6(a). It is notable that the I–V curve traces the former curve in the very low voltage region in each sweeping, which is a typical phenomenon observed in analog resistive switching devices.45 In the negative sweeping region, similar behavior is observable. When a negative bias voltage is applied, the gap between the tip of the Ag filament and the bottom electrode increases and the lateral size of conducting filaments decreases due to the oxidation of Ag filaments. The repetition of negative voltage sweeping leads to a gradual decrease in current flow as shown in Fig. 6(b). These phenomena signify the analog switching behavior.46Fig. 6(c) shows a synaptic behavior of the resistance change when a pulse type bias is repeatedly applied. If a +0.5 V pulse was applied successively, the current read at +0.2 V increases gradually, which is called potentiation.47 In contrast, applying a repeated negative pulse of −0.5 V results in the depression of current flow. These gradual potentiation and depression behaviors could be useful in neuromorphic computing device applications. It is also worth noting that the chemical stability of the device is reasonably high and there is no noticeable reaction between organolead halide perovskite and Ag after the device is stored in a desiccator with a humidity of ∼30% for 2 months, as indicated in Fig. S11 (ESI†).
4. Conclusions
In summary, we demonstrated an interesting bifunctional resistive switching behavior in a simple Ag/CH3NH3PbI3−xClx/FTO structured device. Resistive switching occurs by the formation of Ag filaments, which are formed by the redox reaction of the Ag electrode. Digital resistive switching behavior originates from the abrupt formation and rupture of filaments under relatively higher bias sweeping. Analog behavior could be explained by the successive growth and contraction of Ag filaments, which are also promoted by redox reaction. The newly observed behaviors in this simple Ag/CH3NH3PbI3−xClx/FTO device demonstrate its application potential not only in non-volatile digital memory devices but also in neuromorphic computing devices.
