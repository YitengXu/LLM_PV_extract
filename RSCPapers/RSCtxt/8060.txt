Firstly, Ni–SiO2 composite film was fabricated on a stainless steel substrate by electrodeposition, and then the SiO2 template was removed in alkaline electrolyte by consecutive cyclic voltammetry scans, leading to the formation of a porous Ni (po-Ni) matrix. The structure and morphology of the obtained films were characterized using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The highly porous property of the po-Ni matrix is believed to be quite favourable for electrochemical applications. The electrochemical properties of the po-Ni film were evaluated by cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD) and steady-state polarization curves. The results showed that the porous Ni derived from the Ni–SiO2 composite film exhibits good electrochemical performance for potential use as a supercapacitor material and catalyst for water splitting.IntroductionWith the rapid development of society, slowing down the dependence on fossil fuel, exploiting renewable energy and at the same time developing more advanced energy storage systems are becoming more and more urgent. Solar energy is by far the largest exploitable resource. The challenge remains, however, to have the means to store the solar energy and dispatch it on demand. The conversion of solar energy to chemical and electrical energy is a viable option to meet large-scale energy demands. What's more, the use of solar energy to directly or indirectly drive water splitting, to produce hydrogen and oxygen, has been considered as a satisfactory and efficient process for the storage of electrical energy, which can be further converted to chemical energy.1,2 On the other hand, supercapacitors, a next generation energy storage device for the storage of electricity, have attracted intensive attention, mainly due to their higher power density and longer cycle life than batteries, and their higher energy density compared with conventional dielectric capacitors.3,4 To date, a great deal of effort has been devoted to fabricating highly active electrode materials for water splitting and electrochemical energy storage.Over the past decades, porous materials have been found to have great benefits in both academic research and technological applications. In particular, the highly effective electron transfer, facile ion diffusion and full utilization of the active components allow them have wide applications in many fields of electrochemistry, such as solar cells, fuel cells, batteries, supercapacitors and water splitting.5–7 Transition metal oxides or hydroxides are considered to be promising materials for use as water splitting catalysts,8 batteries9 and supercapacitors,3 due to the variable oxidation states of the metal ions which facilitate redox process and thus provide high charge storage. Among them, IrO2 and RuO2, with good electronic conductivity and high specific capacitance, have been recognized as highly suitable materials for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts and supercapacitors.10,11 However, their toxic nature and high cost limit their commercial application. Therefore, in the past decades, numerous investigations been carried out to search for alternative materials with good electrochemical activities similar to those of IrO2 and/or RuO2, but with low cost. Earth-abundant base metal oxides or hydroxides such as nickel oxide,12–15 manganese oxide16,17 and cobalt oxide18,19 are promising candidates. Nickel-based materials are among the most extensively studied electrode materials, due to their good electrochemical characteristics.9 To date, many approaches, such as chemical bath deposition,20 hydrothermal methods,21 electrophoretic deposition22 and electrodeposition12–14 have been proposed to fabricate nanostructured nickel-based electrode materials with diverse structures and morphologies. In this respect, “soft” and/or “hard” template-based methods have been proven to be a promising strategy for the fabrication of nickel-based electrode materials with high porosity.5 Generally speaking, no matter what methods are employed, an extra procedure is required to remove the template, via high temperature calcination,15,23 strong base etching,24 time-consuming immersion in organic solvent,23 or UV/ozone treatment25 to achieve porous films, which undoubtedly makes the synthesis process complicated.Electrochemical sol–gel methodology makes it easy to prepare thick, highly porous, crack-free and robust silica-based sol–gel films. The film formation is based on the acceleration of sol–gel hydrolysis and condensation processes near the electrode surface under the catalysis of cathodically generated hydroxyl ions (OH−).26 To date, electrodeposited silica-based films have found wide applications in the fields of corrosion protection,27–29 electroanalysis and bio-sensors.30–32 Recently, the Mandler group reported that copper can be electrochemically co-deposited with the silica sol–gel component to prepare nanocomposite films by a single-step method, where copper ions are deposited by electrochemical reduction.33 Furthermore, thin nanocomposite films made of sol–gel based Au nanoparticles using a single electrochemical step have been also prepared.34 Both works mentioned above focused on the modification of the sol–gel matrix.Herein, we report a two-step method to prepare a highly porous metal matrix originating from sol–gel nanocomposite films. Ni–SiO2 nanocomposite films are electrochemically co-deposited onto a conducting substrate in the “deposition step”, followed by a simple and efficient “etching step” to remove the silica component in alkaline solution by consecutive cyclic voltammetric scans. The results show that the obtained metal matrix is highly porous and exhibits excellent electrochemical activity for potential use as a supercapacitor and OER catalyst.ExperimentalElectrode preparationNickel sulfate (NiSO4, 98.5%), sodium sulfate (Na2SO4, 99.0%), potassium hydroxide (KOH, 85.0%) and ethanol (CH3CH2OH, 99.7%) were all purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd (Shanghai, China) and used as received without further purification. All aqueous solutions were prepared with de-ionized (DI) water. Ni–SiO2 composite films were prepared by electrodeposition in a typical precursor consisting of 45 mL of 0.2 M NiSO4/0.2 M H3BO3, 5 mL ethanol and 250 μL tetramethoxysilane (TMOS, Aladdin Reagent, Shanghai, China). The obtained solution was pre-hydrolyzed under stirring for 2 h at 25 ± 1 °C before deposition. A three-electrode compartment was used for deposition. A stainless steel (SS) disk (with a diameter of 1.2 cm), a Ag/AgCl (saturated with KCl) electrode and a platinum plate with an exposed area of 4.0 cm2 were used as the working, reference and counter electrodes, respectively. Prior to use, the SS disks were mechanically abraded by successively finer silicon carbide abrasive paper (400, 600, 1000 grit), then rinsed thoroughly with DI water and acetone and dried with high-pressure nitrogen. The Ni–SiO2 film was electrodeposited on a CHI 630b electrochemical workstation (CH Instrument, Shanghai, China) at −1.1 V vs. Ag/AgCl for 1800 s under slow stirring at 25 ± 1 °C, after which the disk electrodes were taken out and blow-dried with high-pressure nitrogen. Pure Ni film was also prepared for comparison in a similar solution but without TMOS. The deposition time was 150 s due to the much larger deposition rate with respect to the composite deposition. The loaded mass for both the Ni and Ni–SiO2 (after the removal of silica) films was 0.4 ± 0.1 mg, as determined by an electronic microbalance.Physical characterizationN2 adsorption–desorption measurements at 77 K were carried out on a Micromeritics ASAP2020 to study the surface area and porosity of the pure Ni film, Ni–SiO2 composite film and the porous Ni (po-Ni) film after removal of silica. The powders were scratched off from the film using a knife. The morphology and composition of the fabricated films were characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, Carl Zeiss Ultra55, operated at 5 kV) equipped with energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) microanalysis (Oxford EDS Inca Energy Coater 300, operated at 10 kV). The specimens were sputtered with platinum to increase their conductivity. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution TEM (HR-TEM) micrographs were acquired on a Tecnai G2 F30 (Philips-FEI, Co. Ltd) instrument at an acceleration voltage of 300 kV. For TEM observations, one piece of the sample detached from the SS substrate was added to 10 mL ethanol, followed by sonication for 30 min. A few drops of the sonicated suspension were dropped onto a carbon-coated copper grid and dried in air before testing. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the film electrodes were recorded on a RIGAKU D/Max 2550 PC diffractometer equipped with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54059 Å) at 40 kV and 30 mA. Reflection absorption Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTRA-IR) of the film electrodes was recorded on a Nicolet 470 spectrophotometer (Thermo Nicolet, USA) with a resolution of 8 cm−1 for 32 scans before Fourier transformation. A clean SS sheet was used as the background.Electrochemical characterizationCyclic voltammogram (CV) measurements were carried out on a CHI 630b. All the electrochemical tests were operated at 25 ± 1 °C. A similar three-electrode system was used as described above. In order to remove the SiO2 template in the Ni–SiO2 film to obtain the porous Ni film and to activate the Ni component, 50 consecutive CV scans were employed between −0.2 V and 0.5 V vs. Ag/AgCl at a scan rate of 20 mV s−1 in 1.0 M KOH aqueous solution. Then CV measurements with different scan rates at 1, 5, 10, 20, 50 and 100 mV s−1 between 0 and 0.6 V were carried out to evaluate the capacitive behavior of the film electrodes. Galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD) tests were conducted on a potentiostat (Arbin BT-2000, USA) within the potential window from 0 to 0.45 V at different current densities of 4, 6, 8, 10, 20 and 40 A g−1. The steady-state polarization curves for OER were measured with a scan rate of 1.0 mV s−1.Results and discussionThe composition of a sol–gel precursor, such as the type of silane, supporting electrolyte, ratio of water to ethanol and pH, has great influence on the electrodeposition of silica films.33–42 The supporting electrolyte is of great importance because the ability to produce hydroxyl ions is significantly different for various supporting electrolytes. Usually, nitrate ions are the most commonly chosen supporting electrolytes due to their high efficiency for generating hydroxyl ions (NO3− + H2O + 2e− = NO2− + 2OH−).43 While, NiSO4 and H3BO3 is a very common system for the electrodeposition of Ni, it is necessary to demonstrate whether silica can be successfully electrodeposited from a new precursor (NiSO4 + H3BO3 + ethanol + TMOS). Linear scanning voltammetry (LSV) recorded in a solution containing an inert supporting electrolyte only (Na2SO4 + H3BO3 + ethanol) shows that the net cathodic current appears at potentials more negative than −0.9 V as a result of the generation of hydroxyl ions by water splitting (curve 1, Fig. 1). In the case of the existence of TMOS (curve 2, Fig. 1), the onset potential for water splitting does not shift apparently, but slightly smaller currents are detected under the conditions of water splitting, probably caused by the restriction effect on the active sites of the electrode surface after deposition with SiO2 films. Fig. 1  Linear sweep voltammetric curves recorded in various precursors at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1: (1) 45 mL of 0.2 M Na2SO4/0.2 M H3BO3, 5 mL ethanol; (2) 45 mL of 0.2 M Na2SO4/0.2 M H3BO3, 5 mL ethanol and 250 μL TMOS; (3) 45 mL of 0.2 M NiSO4/0.2 M H3BO3, 5 mL ethanol; (4) 45 mL of 0.2 M NiSO4/0.2 M H3BO3, 5 mL ethanol and 250 μL TMOS. SEM observation (Fig. S1†) clearly shows that prolonging the deposition time at −1.1 V in the Na2SO4/H3BO3/ethanol/TMOS precursor results in the consecutive deposition of porous films consisting of small silica particles. Substituting Na2SO4 with NiSO4 in the TMOS-free precursor gives a new shoulder cathodic peak at ∼−0.8 V (curve 3, Fig. 1). This peak is attributed to the reduction of Ni2+ to Ni. The current features are similar to each other in the potential range up to −1.0 V, whether TMOS is added or not. However, the current response declines significantly when the potential shifts negatively from −1.0 V (curve 4, Fig. 1), due to the intensive deposition of the inert silica component forming the Ni–SiO2 composite film.Based on the above phenomenon, Ni–SiO2 composite film is fabricated at −1.1 V for 1800 s, and the net increased mass is 0.4 ± 0.1 mg, obtained by weighing the electrode before electrodeposition and after etching the SiO2 template. For pure Ni film, the deposition time is shortened to 150 s and the same mass is achieved, while prolonging the deposition time does not obviously improve the electrochemical performance and results in the peeling off of the deposit somewhat. It is found that the NiSO4/H3BO3/ethanol/TMOS precursor system is very stable and can be stored for more than six months at room temperature without degradation.Prior to electrochemical characterization, both Ni and Ni–SiO2 films underwent 50 consecutive CV scans in 1.0 M KOH at a scan rate of 20 mV s−1. During this process, not only is the SiO2 template removed, but also the Ni component is activated. The electro-oxidation reaction on the Ni surface can be described as given below:44 2Ni + O2 + 2OH− + 2 e− → 2NiOOH(1)For the Ni film, as shown in Fig. 2a, one typical redox couple is observed between 0.3 and 0.4 V, which is attributed to the conversion between Ni(OH)2 and NiOOH:45 NiOOH + H2O + e− ↔ Ni(OH)2 + OH−(2) Fig. 2  Continuous CV scans of Ni (a) and Ni–SiO2 (b) films recorded in 1.0 M KOH at a scan rate of 20 mV s−1. The inset in (a) shows the enlargement of the marked black dotted rectangle. The solid arrow shows the increase in anodic current density with the increasing the number of scans. The CV features of Ni film are almost the same from the 1st to the 50th CV cycle, except for the gradually increasing peak currents as a result of activation. In the case of Ni–SiO2 film, however, no obvious redox peak is observed in the first scan. This means that Ni is isolated by the electrochemically inert SiO2, by impeding the transport of electrolyte ions and electron transfer in the Ni–SiO2 composite film. However, upon continuous CV scanning, the redox couple gradually appears. As shown in Fig. 2b, both the anodic and cathodic currents increase in amplitude with subsequent CV cycles, suggesting that the electro-codeposited SiO2 template in the composite film is etched in situ along with the activation of Ni, leading to the generation of much more active po-Ni exposed to the solution. The related peak currents of the po-Ni film are much higher than those of the pure Ni film.The chemical structures of the Ni–SiO2 film before and after removing the silica template in 1.0 M KOH were characterized by FT-IR spectroscopy (Fig. 3). The broad band at 3405 cm−1 and the peak at 1643 cm−1 can be ascribed to the stretching and bonding modes of –OH groups of the surface-adsorbed or trapped water in the films.46 The characteristic peak at 1021 cm−1 in the fresh Ni–SiO2 film is assigned to the asymmetric stretching in –Si–O–Si bonds.47 However, this peak disappeared after the film underwent 50 repeated CV scans in 1.0 M KOH, indicating that the SiO2 template is completely removed. The peak at 1380 cm−1 is attributed to the trace surface adsorption of sulfate ions (vibration mode of SO42−, originating from nickel sulfate), and the band from 400 to 700 cm−1 can be assigned to the vibration of Ni–O. Fig. 3  FTIR spectra of the Ni–SiO2 films before (1) and after (2) 50 consecutive CV scans in 1.0 M KOH at scan rate of 20 mV s−1. The deposition of metallic Ni is evidenced by XRD measurement (Fig. S2†). For both the Ni film and the po-Ni film, besides two diffraction peaks derived from the SS substrate (JCPDS: 47-1405), typical diffraction peaks located at 44.6 and 51.9° corresponding to the (111) and (200) planes of metallic nickel (JCPDS card no. 04-0850), respectively, are observed.The surface morphology of the Ni and Ni–SiO2 films before and after undergoing consecutive CV cycling in KOH were characterized by FE-SEM. As shown in Fig. 4a, the Ni film shows a flat and compact surface, even in the high magnification image (inset in Fig. 4a). Only a quite dense and irregularly dendritic structure is observed. Even after activation in KOH for 50 continuous CV scans, a smooth film is present with a slightly increased roughness amplitude (Fig. 4b). In the case of the Ni–SiO2 film, however, micrometer-sized cracks are revealed on the surface whether the template is removed or not (Fig. 4c and d). Particles with sizes of hundreds of nanometers were growing over the plate areas. It is clear that the bottom of the cracks are still covered with Ni–SiO2 or Ni deposits. Environmental SEM was further used to characterize the morphology of the Ni–SiO2 film under low vacuum conditions with a thin layer of KOH aqueous solution. The environmental SEM image (Fig. S3†) reveals a crack-free film when in alkaline solution. This suggests that the cracks appearing in the SEM observation are formed upon dehydration. Similar phenomena were also reported by Nocera et al., who prepared Ni- and Co-based catalysts from borate or phosphate systems which were used for water splitting in benign conditions.13,19,48,49 Fig. 4  SEM images of the Ni (a) and (b) and Ni–SiO2 (c) and (d) films. (a) and (c) show the fresh films, while (b) and (d) show the films after undergoing 50 consecutive CV scans in 1.0 M KOH. The insets in (a) and (c) show the high-magnification images. (e) A scanning electron micrograph of a SS electrode coated with Ni–SiO2 film (i), and the corresponding energy dispersive X-ray maps of the same sample showing the dispersion of Si (ii), Ni (iii), and O (iv) elements. The co-deposition of Ni and silica in the Ni–SiO2 composite film is further evidenced by EDS (Fig. S4†). Energy dispersive X-ray mapping (Fig. 4e) further indicates that the composite components are dispersed uniformly in the whole film. After treatment with KOH for consecutive CV scans, the signal of Si disappears (Fig. S5 and S6†), indicating that silica is entirely removed, forming a porous structured Ni film.The detailed microstructure and composition of the Ni–SiO2 films before and after removal of the template were characterized by low and high resolution TEM. Fig. 5a shows a typical piece of sheet-like Ni–SiO2 film embedded with spherical particles whose diameter is about 0.5 μm (consistent with the size of the particles observed in the FE-SEM image, Fig. 4c). After removing the SiO2 template in 1.0 M KOH, the film becomes coarse, accompanied by the appearance of many small visible pores in the nanosheet (Fig. 5c). What's more, after etching, the black embedded particles which were observed before etching (Fig. 5a) disappear, leaving behind the profile of the particles with a diameter of 50 nm (see the high magnification image, inset in Fig. 5c). Fig. 5  TEM and HRTEM images of the Ni–SiO2 films before (a and b) and after (c and d) removing the SiO2 template in 1.0 M KOH. The inset in (c) shows the high magnification image. These particles reveal hierarchically porous structures. The lattice fringes in the HRTEM image (Fig. 5d), corresponding to the (111) plane of nickel metal, are consistent with XRD measurements (Fig. S2†). Note that the lattice fringes are not so clear in the fresh Ni–SiO2 composite film (Fig. 5b), because of the existence of an embedded framework of amorphous silica.A dramatically increased porosity of the po-Ni film was quantitatively observed from the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms. Results show that the Ni film only has a BET surface area of 2.06 m2 g−1. Considering the apparent geometric surface area of the as-prepared nickel film (∼1 cm2/0.4 mg), the roughness factor (RF) of the Ni film is calculated to be ∼8.0. The po-Ni film has a BET surface area of 21.99 m2 g−1, corresponding to a RF of ∼88, ten times greater than that of the conventional Ni film.Cyclic voltammogram (CV) measurements of the Ni and po-Ni film electrodes were performed at different scan rates of 1, 10, 20, 50 and 100 mV s−1 between 0 and 0.6 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) in 1.0 M KOH. CV patterns of the Ni and po-Ni film electrodes are shown in Fig. 6a and b, respectively. Fig. 6  CV curves of Ni (a) and Ni–SiO2 (b) films recorded in 1.0 M KOH at different scan rates; dependence of specific capacitance on the scanning rate (c) and CV scan number (d) of Ni (1) and po-Ni (2) films. CV scans were conducted in 1.0 M KOH at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1. The inset in (a) shows the enlargement of the marked black dotted rectangle. Both samples show non-rectangular CV patterns, suggesting the existence of pseudocapacitance characteristics due to the occurrence of the faradaic redox reaction of the NiOOH/Ni(OH)2 couple. With the increase of scan rate, the redox current increases, and the anodic peak shifts towards a more positive potential and overlaps with the oxygen evolution wave; meanwhile the cathodic peak shifts towards negative potential. The specific capacitance (Cs, F g−1) values at different scan rates (ν, V s−1) are calculated using the following equation:22 (3)where ΔV (V) is the applied potential window (Va to Vc) and m (g) is the weight of the active material. As shown in Fig. 6c, the calculated specific capacitance values for the po-Ni film at scan rates of 1, 5, 10, 50 and 100 mV s−1 are 1376, 926, 842, 807, 708 and 573 F g−1, respectively, while the specific capacitance values for the pure Ni film at the same scan rates are 257, 76, 43, 31, 21 and 17 F g−1, respectively. The higher specific capacitance of the po-Ni film is due to its unique porous morphology, which provides good access to OH− ions and water. It is noted that the specific capacitance of the po-Ni film is higher than those of nanostructured Ni(OH)2 particles or thin films prepared by low-temperature cathodic electrodeposition (834.6 F g−1 at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1),50 chemical bath deposition (462 F g−1 at 5 mV s−1),51 hydrothermal deposition (357 F g−1 at 5 mV s−1)52 and chemical precipitation methods (805 F g−1 at 5 mV s−1).53The decreased specific capacitance at higher scan rate is attributed to the slower transport of charge-compensating OH− ions in the film.54 At lower scan rates, the higher extent of utilization of the electro-active surface of Ni enhances the specific capacitance.Long-term cycling stability of an electrode material is another critical requirement for practical applications. Repeated CV cycles were conducted in 1.0 M KOH between 0 and 0.6 V at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1 (Fig. S7†). Fig. 6d shows that the specific capacitance for both the Ni and po-Ni films decreases significantly in the first 400 cycles, and then maintains a relatively steady value. Much higher specific capacitance was observed for the porous Ni film than the Ni film during the whole cycling measurements.Furthermore, as a commonly employed technique, galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD) measurements were also performed on the po-Ni film electrode at different current densities within the potential window from 0 to 0.45 V in 1.0 M KOH solution. Fig. S8a† displays the typical charge–discharge cycles of po-Ni at current densities of 4, 6, 8, 10, 20 and 40 A g−1. The shape of the nonlinear charge–discharge curves is characteristic of pseudocapacitance behavior due to the electrochemical adsorption–desorption or quasi-reversible redox reactions at the electrode–electrolyte interface. The specific capacitance can be calculated according to the following equation:20 (4)where i and Δt are the constant current (A) and discharge time (s), respectively.The calculated specific capacitances are 670, 555, 513, 488, 388 and 321 F g−1 at the discharging current densities of 4, 6, 8, 10, 20 and 40 A g−1, respectively (Fig. S8b†). The consecutive decrease in capacitance is caused by the large IR drop and the insufficient utilization of active material involved in the redox reaction under higher current densities. The above-mentioned high capacitance suggests that the po-Ni film electrode has a good rate capability at a large current density, which is very important for the electrode material of a supercapacitor to provide high power density.Not only showing good performance as a supercapacitor material, the po-Ni film derived from the Ni–SiO2 composite film prepared by electrochemical co-deposition also shows excellent electrochemical catalytic performance towards the OER. Fig. 7a displays illustrative steady-state polarization curves for the Ni and po-Ni films, recorded in 1.0 M KOH at a scan rate of 1.0 mV s−1. Significantly enhanced electrocatalytic activity for the po-Ni film towards the OER is observed with respect to the pure Ni film. The po-Ni film offers a current of 100 mA cm−2, one order of magnitude higher than that of the pure Ni film (∼10 mA cm−2), at 700 mV vs. Ag/AgCl. Nevertheless, the normalized current–potential curve, derived from the ratio of current to roughness factor (estimated from BET), i/RF, a measure of the real activity per active site, indicates a similar electrocatalytic activity for both the Ni and po-Ni electrodes (Fig. S9†). This suggests that the enhanced electrochemical property of the po-Ni film is a result of the geometric effect. Fig. 7  Steady-state polarization curves (a) and derived Tafel curves (b) of Ni (1) and po-Ni (2) films in 1.0 M KOH at a scan rate of 1.0 mV s−1. Also, Tafel curves (Fig. 7b) derived from the steady-state polarization curves reveal the identical slopes (∼90 and ∼200 mV/dec at low and high over-potential ranges, respectively) for both the electrodes in the selected potential regions, suggesting that the presence of the silica component does not alter the OER mechanism. The apparent electrocatalytic activity of this po-Ni electrode is much higher than those of Ni-based electrodes, as recently reported in the literature under similar electrolysis conditions. Lyons et al. observed a current density of 30 mA cm−2 and 10 mA cm−2 at ∼800 mV vs. Hg/HgO (≈700 mV vs. Ag/AgCl) for the passive oxide-covered Ni electrode55,56 and electro-precipitated nickel hydroxide electrode,57 respectively. The electrocatalytic activity of the po-Ni film electrode (23 mA cm−2 at 0.55 V vs. Ag/AgCl, i.e. ∼0.65 V vs. Hg/HgO) is even more efficient than the binary Ni–Mo oxide electrodes (7.9 mA cm−2 at 0.65 V vs. Hg/HgO), but is lower compared to those of ternary Ni–Fe–Mo oxides (123–154 mA cm−2 at 0.65 V vs. Hg/HgO) prepared by precipitation.58The chemical stability of the as-prepared electrodes was further evaluated using galvanostatic electrolysis. The oxygen evolution potential of the po-Ni electrode at 100 mA cm−2 increases from 0.7 V to 0.8 V after 2 days of utilization, and then remains almost unchanged. The electrode still has good electrocatalytic properties after 5 days use. The morphological analysis indicates no appreciable differences between the “fresh” and aged electrodes. The electrode (as shown in Fig. S10†) still shows a rough surface.Compared to the traditional concentrated alkaline electrolytes, it is much more promising that oxygen evolution catalysts can operate efficiently under more benign conditions, such as in the near neutral water. In view of this, the OER activity of the po-Ni film electrode was characterized in borate buffer systems, which were recently used to characterize Ni- and Co-based oxygen evolution catalysts.11,12,18,48,49 As shown from the steady-state polarization tests (Fig. S11†), the po-Ni film shows a much higher activity towards the OER compared to the Ni film at various pH values. The Tafel curve (Fig. 8) obtained for the po-Ni film in a solution at pH 9.06 gives a slope of ∼72 mV/decade at current densities ranging from 2.7 mA cm−2 to 5.1 μA cm−2, in the range of 40–80 mV/decade, as reported for typical Ni-based oxides in such a benign medium.56 The electrocatalytic properties of the po-Ni film under these mild conditions (1 mA cm−2 at an over-potential of 450 mV) are as good as those of the Ni–B composite catalyst prepared by Nocera et al.12 Fig. 8  Tafel plots, η = Eappl − iR − Ee, of a po-Ni film operated in 1.0 M H3BO3 (pH 9.06), where η is the over-potential, R corresponds to the solution resistance, and Ee accounts for the thermodynamic potential of water splitting at this pH (0.496 V vs. Ag/AgCl (saturated KCl)). The slope of the line is 72 mV/decade. ConclusionsPorous Ni films have been fabricated using an electrochemically co-deposited SiO2 component as a template. After the composite films are activated in KOH by consecutive CV scans, the SiO2 template can be removed in situ, leading to the formation of a porous Ni film. The po-Ni films exhibit high electrochemical activities for use as supercapacitor materials and OER catalysts. This novel silica co-electrodeposition route will find wider applications in the preparation of highly porous and active metal and/or oxide films.AcknowledgementsThis work was supported by the NSFC (no. 21173187), the Qianjiang Talent Program of Zhejiang Province (no. 2010R10046), NCET, RFDP (no. 20100101110008), and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities.Notes and referencesA.
