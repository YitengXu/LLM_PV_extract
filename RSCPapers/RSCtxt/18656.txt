    , Accepted 11th January 2019First published on 23rd January 2019AbstractWe introduce an approach to synthesize polymer-stabilized CsPbBr3 perovskite nanoparticles (NPs) using ammonium bromide-functionalized polymers as both bromide precursors and stabilizing ligands. The polymer-passivated NPs exhibit significant advantages over conventional perovskite NPs owing to their facile dispersion in polymer matrices and enhanced optoelectronic stability.
Perovskites with the structural formula AMX3 (A = cation, M = metal, and X = halide) are advancing rapidly in electronic materials science.1 Owing to their crystallinity, strong optical absorption, small exciton binding energy, balanced electron–hole mobility, and long exciton diffusion lengths,2–4 perovskite solar cells have exceeded 20% power conversion efficiency (PCE) in photovoltaic devices.5 Furthermore, halide-containing perovskite nanoparticles (NPs) promote exciton recombination and exhibit tunable bandgaps, providing potential benefits to light-emitting diodes (LEDs),6 lasers,7 and two-photon absorbers.8
The synthesis of colloidal CH3NH3PbBr3 perovskite NPs from precursor salts and surfactants in solution was reported by Pérez-Prieto and coworkers.9 Kovalenko subsequently described a hot injection method to achieve all inorganic CsPbX3 NPs with photoluminescence (PL) quantum yield (QY) up to 90%, narrow full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) emission, and tunable bandgap.10 Unlike more conventional quantum dots, such as CdSe, these CsPbX3 NPs did not require wide bandgap inorganic passivating shells to achieve high QY, due to a high tolerance for defects.11 Furthermore, the FWHM of PL emission from CsPbBr3 NPs is relatively insensitive to NP size distribution, which is beneficial for devices that require color purity.12
A serious problem associated with halide-containing perovskites is their sensitivity to humidity and air. For example, moisture causes bulk CH3NH3PbI3 to decompose and produce an additional PbI2 phase.13 This is exacerbated in perovskite NPs due to their high surface-to-volume ratios.14 When CsPbBr3 NPs were precipitated into polar solvents, their PL decreased significantly, followed by loss of colloidal stability.15 To overcome these issues, Li and coworkers developed silica-passivated perovskite NPs.14 In other studies, interdigitation of the alkyl chains of NP ligands with alkyl-substituted polymers or a nanocomposite of the NPs with poly(styrene–ethylene–butylene–styrene), were shown to improve perovskite NP stability.16,17 Another recent report described the synthesis of CsPbBr3 NPs in poly(styrene-block-(2-vinyl)pyridine) micelles to enhance NP stability.18
Here we report the synthesis of CsPbBr3 perovskite NPs with ammonium bromide-containing polymers that serve as both stabilizing ligands and bromide precursors. Cube-shaped CsPbBr3 NPs were generated following high temperature injection of the ammonium bromide-functionalized polystyrene into a metal carboxylate precursor solution. This yielded polymer-passivated CsPbBr3 NPs amenable to purification in non-polar solvents with retention of high photoluminescence quantum yield. In addition, polymer-passivated NPs produced optically clear nanocomposite films with enhanced stability over that of small molecule-passivated perovskite NPs. This strategy was then extended to CsPbBr3 NPs stabilized by conjugated polymers for producing electronically active polymer–perovskite NP hybrid materials.
Ammonium bromide-terminated polystyrene was prepared and used for the preparation of perovskite NPs. The polymers were prepared by atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP),19 followed by tert-butyoxycarbonyl (t-boc)-deprotection to give the NH3Br-terminated PS. As it was recently reported that ammonium cations interact with surface bromides of CsPbBr3 NPs by ‘hydrogen bridging’, or filling of octahedral holes on the perovskite surface,15,20 we surmised that such functional polymers would be ideal for stabilizing perovskite NP surfaces and acting as a source of bromide during NP growth. In typical experiments, Pb- and Cs-oleate (0.06 mmol) were dissolved in mesitylene (17 mL), a high boiling solvent useful for dissolving both metal oleates and ammonium bromide-containing polymers. The metal precursor solution was heated to 160 °C and the ammonium bromide-functionalized polymer (2 g in 4 mL of mesitylene) were injected, producing the PS-ω-NH3Br-passivated CsPbBr3 NPs (PS-ω-NH3Br NPs). The resultant NPs were precipitated in hexane and redispersed in toluene. The preparation of the CsPbBr3 NPs using a random copolymer of polystyrene and 2-methacryloyloxyethyl ammonium bromide is also described in the SI.
The PS-NH3Br NPs exhibited high quantum yield (QY, 79%) and FWHM as narrow as 17 nm (Fig. 1A). Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD, Fig. 1E) experiments performed on the CsPbBr3 NPs revealed a pattern consistent with either a cubic or an orthorhombic crystal structure; as reported previously, the broad diffraction peaks resulting from the small crystallite sizes complicate distinction between these two structures.12 TEM (Fig. 1D) showed cube-shaped NPs with cube edge length of 11.2 ± 4.6 nm. The photoluminescence (PL) full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) was narrow, despite a high standard deviation of particle size. In these samples, since the average crystal diameter is larger than the Bohr diameter of bulk CsPbBr3 (7 nm),12 these NPs are in the weak confinement regime, leading to a relatively size-insensitive bandgap.

The coordination of polymer ligands to CsPbBr3 NPs modifies their solution properties and allows purification in non-polar solvents without substantial loss of PL QY. Fig. 1B and C shows that when PS-ω-NH3Br NPs were precipitated into hexanes, then redispersed in toluene, the QY recovered to its initial value, even following two purification cycles. In contrast, CsPbBr3 NPs prepared with oleylamine and oleic acid ligands (oleyl NPs) did not precipitate in hexane, and two purification cycles involving precipitation in acetone caused the QY to decrease to <50% of its original value. Such purification difficulties, with an associated decrease in QY and/or degradation to elemental precursor material, has been notably problematic.15,21 The use of a nonpolar solvent to purify polymer-passivated NPs therefore represents a potentially attractive route for perovskite NP isolation and processing without loss of their desirable optoelectronic properties.
To better characterize NP surface passivation of these hybrid materials, diffusion-ordered nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (DOSY) was employed. Since ligands on CsPbBr3 perovskite NPs are dynamic, the diffusion coefficient reflects the average of bound and unbound states.15 As shown in Fig. 1G, the proton signals at 6.6 ppm in benzene-d6 were characterized by DOSY, employing polymer samples prior to Boc deprotection. The attenuation plot derived from the DOSY NMR spectrum, shown in Fig. 1F, revealed a diffusion coefficient of 7.0 × 10−11 m2 s−1 (RH = 5.1 nm) for the polymer-functionalized NPs, and 1.6 × 10−10 m2 s−1 (RH = 2.2 nm) without the NPs, the difference attributed to surface coordination of the polymer.
Potential optoelectronic and device applications of these polymer–perovskite composites would benefit from optical transparency.22 When a toluene solution of the PS-ω-NH3Br NPs was dropcast onto silicon or glass, optically clear nanocomposite films were obtained; this is in contrast to oleyl NPs in polystyrene (Mn: 6.4 kg mol−1) that appeared opaque, as shown in Fig. 2A (inset). Aggregation of the oleyl NPs would be anticipated from the poor compatibility between the ligands and the polymer matrix.23 The representative TEM images in Fig. 2B and C confirm that the oleyl NPs aggregated considerably in polystyrene, whereas the PS-ω-NH3Br NPs dispersed cleanly. To further confirm the aggregation/dispersion behavior of the nanocomposites, small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) measurements were performed on the nanocomposite powders. As shown in Fig. 2D, the oleyl NPs in PS (Mn: 6.4 kg mol−1) showed a characteristic d-spacing of 11.2 nm, consistent with the expected inter-particle spacing when the NPs packed closely (with edge length of 8.4 ± 1.4 nm and ligand shell thickness of 1.6 nm). PS-ω-NH3Br NPs dispersed in the same polymer showed no such peak, due to the more diffuse and random NP dispersion in these samples. When the molecular weight of the PS matrix was increased to 25.8 kg mol−1, PS-ω-NH3Br NPs showed a SAXS peak with a d-spacing of 18.3 nm indicating some degree of NP aggregation (with edge length of 11.2 ± 4.6 nm and polymer ligand shell thickness ∼7 nm), consistent with previous reports that NPs tend to aggregate when the molecular weight of polymers in the matrix exceeds that of the polymer ligands.24

The PS-ω-NH3Br perovskite NPs also showed higher PL stability, relative to the oleyl NPs, in the presence of polar solvents such as 1-propanol. As shown in Fig. 2E, the PL intensity of spin-coated films containing oleyl NPs declined to about 12% of their initial value when immersed in 1-propanol for 1 minute. However, thin films containing the polymer-stabilized NPs did not show any degradation within 10 min (Fig. S8, ESI†). Although the origin of this improved stabilization requires further study, we expect that the short alkyl chain-stabilized oleyl NPs may segregate to the air–polymer interface and be more readily exposed to the solvent, while the better-dispersed polymer-stabilized NPs are more effectively protected by the polymer matrix. In addition, as shown in Fig. 2F, the polymer-stabilized NPs showed higher colloidal stability in toluene/1-propanol mixtures, possibly due to better local protection of NPs by polymer ligands in solution.
Having estabilished the stabilization of perovskite NPs with end-functionalized polymer ligands, we extended the concept to conjugated polymers. Ammonium bromide-terminated poly(9,9′-dioctylfluorene) (PF-NH3Br) was synthesized by Suzuki–Miyaura coupling, employing a stoichiometric imbalance to favor a Boc group at one chain-end (PF-NHBoc); subsequent Boc-deprotection yielded PF-NH3Br (Mn = 3.9 kDa, Đ = 1.6, GPC against polystyrene standards with THF as eluent). The initial presence and subsequent loss of the Boc group were confirmed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and 1H NMR spectroscopy (Fig. 3A and B) When PF-NH3Br was used for NP synthesis, cube-shaped CsPbBr3 NPs (PF-NH3Br NPs) were obtained, as shown in the TEM of Fig. 3C. The PL spectra of the resultant solution (Fig. 3D) revealed the PF-NH3Br NPs to have spectral features from both the conjugated polymer ligand and the CsPbBr3 NP core. When PLE spectra were recorded with an emission peak at 510 nm, corresponding to the CsPbBr3 NP core, excitation peaks from polyfluorene ligands were observed, indicating energy transfer from the polymer ligands to the CsPbBr3 NPs. Such exciton energy transfer could be beneficial when these NPs are incorporated into an emissive layer of LED devices, which requires efficient transport of electrons and holes to the NPs.

In summary, CsPbBr3 perovskite NPs were synthesized using ammonium bromide-terminated polymers as both bromine precursors and passivating ligands. The polymer-stabilized CsPbBr3 NPs were precipitated and purified in a non-polar medium without significant PL reduction, in contrast to conventional perovskite NPs stabilized by small molecule ligands. In addition, polymer-passivated NPs improved the optical clarity of the nanocomposite film, along with NP dispersion and stability, all key features that point towards applications in light-converting devices. This synthetic strategy was extended further to successfully synthesize NPs with conjugated PF-NH3Br polymer ligands, which hold promise for applications in optoelectronics.
