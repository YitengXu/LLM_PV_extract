    , Accepted 7th March 2011First published on 21st April 2011AbstractA high-efficiency dye-sensitized solar cell prototype has been designed and fabricated, in which the working electrode and counter electrode are in direct contact and singly twisted. The cell is sealed in a capillary. In this solar cell configuration, the area ratio between the counter and working electrode is extremely low which allows the independent adjustment of electrolyte volume and the distance between counter electrode and photo-anode. Also it is more easily sealed compared to planar solar cell. The effects of TiO2 film thickness, twisted pitch of counter electrode and length of device have been investigated. Our results indicate that this novel configuration has demonstrated excellent modularization function, three dimensional light harvesting capacities and the relative independence of incident light angles due to the symmetry structure. The power conversion efficiency of one cell of 9.5 cm in length can reach up to 5.41% at standard test condition (100 mW cm−2) and the power output may double under intense diffuse illumination. As far as we know, this is the longest and most efficient fiber-shaped dye-sensitized solar cell consisting of liquid electrolyte. The longer the fiber-shaped solar cell is, the more suitable it is for woven solar power textile if it is encapsulated in transparent flexible plastic capillary.
Introduction
In the last two decades, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have attracted great attention in both academic research and industry due to its high efficiency, low-cost and environmentally-friendly properties.1,2 Benefiting from the continuing optimization of materials and fabrication procedure, the current planar DSSC cells using I3−/I− electrolyte have achieved up to 11–12% conversion efficiency3–8 and the efficiency of large-scale module has also reached 8% with the aperture area of 25.45 cm2,9 which are very promising for real application and industrialization. However, there are still obstacles to be overcome, such as cost, limited efficiency in the large-scale module, electrolyte linkage, cell sealing and stability.
The cost of DSSCs is mainly from transparent conductive electrode FTO (fluorine doped tin oxide). Also the percentage of this part of cost gradually increases as the other raw materials and structures are optimized.10 In addition, the limited sheet resistance of FTO can result in dramatically lower conversion efficiency at larger cell size, which becomes one of the key factors in preventing the industrialization of DSSCs.11 In contrast, highly conductive metal substrates are advantageous. For example, stainless steel sheet and mesh, and titanium sheet and mesh have been used as the substrates of DSSCs and reached 7.41% efficiency.12–20
Although the I3−/I− electrolyte facilitates the high conversion efficiency in DSSCs, the I3−/I− electrolyte is easy to volatilize, and is corrosive to the electrodes and sealing materials, which permit the leakage of electrolyte and instability of the whole cell. Other electrolytes, such as solid state and quasi-solid state electrolyte, ionic liquid and iodide-free electrolyte, have been used to replace the I3−/I− electrolyte, but their cell efficiency is not comparable to the latter.21–24 The conventional planar solar cells are sealed on the four sides, which is a complicated and time-consuming process. It not only raises the manufacturing cost, but also leads to higher rate of electrolyte leakage as the contacting area between I3−/I− electrolytes and sealing materials is larger. Besides, there are other issues that affect the large-scale production and application of DSSCs, e.g. the inter-connection between the sealing and cell module can reduce the effective aperture area ratio, and thus result in lower efficiency per unit area; two assembled planar electrodes tend to break at the interface due to the thermal dilation, deformation and strain.10,11
For their alternative, nonplanar device architectures, fiber-shaped DSSCs have attracted increasing attention, which have a three-dimensional (3-D) structure and readily permit integration into modules using textile technologies.25 Both liquid and solid state DSSCs based on TiO2 nanoparticles have been successfully fabricated on stainless steel wire, but their efficiency is quite low.26,27 Very recently, fiber-shaped DSSCs using TiO2 nanoparticles on glass rods, TiO2 nanotube arrays on Ti wires and ZnO on optical fibers have been reported.28–32 The highest reported efficiency of fiber-shaped DSSCs has reached above 4%, of which the aperture area is taken as its length multiplied by the diameter of the photo anode.28–33 However all these fiber-shaped DSSCs are limited in length, which are usually only 1 or 2 cm long. They are too short to be integrated into power e-textiles using textile technology.34 In addition to DSSCs, photovoltaic fibers have already expanded into the field of organic solar cells.35–38
In this work, we have designed and fabricated a new type of fiber-shaped DSSC by coating a TiO2 nanoparticle film on Ti wires, where the working electrode and counter electrode are directly twisted in the electrolyte solution and sealed in a capillary. The whole 9.5 cm long cells under 100 mW cm−2 illumination without any masks have demonstrated a power conversion efficiency of 5.41%. And fabrication of long fiber-shaped solar cell is a necessary route for the realization of future solar power e-textiles.34 Furthermore, the power output can be doubled due to its 3-D light harvest capacity, which places our cell as the longest, most efficient device among all the known fiber-shaped DSSCs.28–33 And it can be made completely flexible by sealing in a transparent flexible plastic capillary.
Experimental
Fabrication of fiber-shaped photo-anode
The working electrodes are achieved by coating TiO2 nanoparticle film on Ti wires (99.7% purity from Alfa Aesar, with the diameter of 0.25 mm). The TiO2 colloids are prepared from 0.1 g P25 TiO2 nanoparticles (Degussa), 0.2 mL acetylacetone, 10 mL deionized water and 0.38 g polyethylene glycol-5000 (Aldrich). The preparation procedures are described as follows: (1) Ti wires are ultrasonicated successively in acetone, isopropanol and ethanol for 10 min each, and then they are sintered in 400 °C air for 15 min. At this stage, the color of Ti wires turns from a shiny metal color to blue-yellow, indicating the formation of TiO2 condensed layer. (2) The oxidized Ti wires are then immersed into pre-formed TiO2 colloids via dipping coating method, which leads to a TiO2 nanoparticle layer coating on the Ti substrates. (3) The TiO2-coated Ti wires are sintered at 350 °C for 5 min to remove the solvent in the colloids. (4) Steps 2 and 3 are repeated several times, and the number of repetitions determines the thickness of the TiO2 film. (5) The TiO2-coated Ti electrodes are sintered at 450 °C air for 30 min, and then they are cooled down to 100 °C. These treated electrodes are sensitized for 24 h by immersing into N719 (RuL2(NCS)2:2TBA, L = 2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylic-acid, TBA = tetrabutylammonium, Qiseguang inc., Dalian, China) ethanol solution. (6) The sensitized electrodes are then rinsed with anhydrous ethanol and dried in air. The photo-anodes of fiber-shaped solar cell are produced.

Assembly of devices
The counter electrodes are Pt wires with a diameter of 40 μm. Pt wires are treated according to ref. 26. These Pt wires are twisted around the pre-formed photo-anodes as mentioned above, both of which are then immersed into a glass capillary (inner diameter is 0.5 mm and outer diameter is 0.8 mm) containing electrolyte. The electrolyte is composed of 0.1 M LiI (Aldrich, 99%), 0.05 M I2 (Aldrich), 0.1 M 4-tetrabutylepyridine (Aldrich) in propylene carbonate (Aldrich)/acetonitrile (Siyou Inc., Tianjin, China, GR) (V:V = 1:1). The two ends of the capillary are sealed with wax to form cell D-A. In parallel, we have sealed the assembled fiber cell into a glass slot that is formed between two pieces of side glass with a distance of 0.5 mm, and this cell is defined as cell D-B. The third cell device (D-C) consists of the same Pt wire-photo-anode twist structure as the cell D-A. Without sealing, D-C is positioned horizontally, on which electrolyte solution is dropped. The electrolyte will be held via capillarity on D-C. However, the electrolyte is volatilized quickly and D-C must be tested immediately.
Methods and measurement
The electrode morphology is imaged by S570 Hitachi SEM (Japan) and the solar simulator is Yamashita DESO (Japan). All the device IV tests and short circuit current responses are conducted on Keithley Model 2000, with a light density of 100 mW cm−2. And the whole fiber-shaped solar cell is all under illumination without any masks. The aperture area of the cell is obtained from the project area Aproj according to ref. 28–36. Aproj is equal to the diameter of Ti wire + the thickness of TiO2 film × 2 times the length of device, and the short circuit current density Jsc = Isc/Aproj (Isc is short circuit current), the power conversion efficiency η = Jsc × Voc × FF/Pin. Here, Voc is the open circuit voltage, FF is the filled factor, and Pin is the intensity of incident light. The amount of dye adsorbed on the working electrode is desorbed in 0.01 M KOH ethanol–water (V:V = 1:1) solution for 4 h and is characterized viaUV-Vis spectroscopy. The electrochemical impedance spectrum is obtained using solartron 1250 frequency analyser under 100 mW cm−2 illumination bias and open circuit voltage (Voc) forward bias. The perturbation voltage is 10 mV, and the frequency range is from 60 kHz to 20 mHz.
Due to the 3-D structure, there are different irradiation modes for D-A cells. The schematic diagram of the experimental set-up is shown in Scheme 1. In (a), the whole cell is laid under the illumination of the solar simulator with a light density of 100 mW cm−2. The incident light is perpendicular to the axis of fiber cells, which is defined as standard irradiation mode (SM). SM is the same as the method used for planar cell test. In (b), a diffuse reflector is added underneath the cell, which is called the diffuse reflection irradiation mode (DRM).

Results and discussion
Device structures

Fig. 1(a) displays the schematic diagram of this fiber-shaped cell. The SEM image of the twisted electrode structure is shown in Fig. 1(b), where the twisted Pt wire is 40 μm in diameter and the length of photo-anode approaches about 10 cm. The corresponding optical image of the electrodes is illustrated in Fig. 1(c), from which we can clearly see that the twisted electrode structure is flexible and bendable. Fig. 1(d) shows the optical image of a sealed cell device, and one end of the electrode contact is zoomed in for Fig. 1(e). The cell based on the structure shown in Fig. 1 is named the D-A cell. In the D-A cell, the working electrode is Ti wire coated with a layer of dye-sensitized porous TiO2, around which a Pt wire, used as counter electrode, is directly twisted, and both are then immersed into a glass capillary containing I3−/I− electrolyte. As shown in Fig. 1, easy sealing is one advantage of fiber-shaped solar cells. That is one end or both ends of the capillary glass tube need to be sealed during the sealing process, so the total sealing areas are independent of the size of fiber cell. As the devices scale up, the ratio of sealing area to the total device area is smaller, and even can be neglected. This increases the effective cell area and ensures the high efficiency and the output of the cell. Furthermore, it also reduces possible leakage of electrolyte as the sealing area reduces, so the performance of the fiber cell can be more stable. Third, the electrodes are flexible and the whole device can be made flexible if the glass capillary is replaced by a transparent flexible plastic capillary. As a result, the long flexible fiber-shaped solar cell can be woven into a power suit, which is a great potential application of fiber-shaped solar cell.34

Effects of TiO2 thickness on the performance of the D-A device
First, we investigate the effects of TiO2 thickness on the performances of D-A devices. In this series of experiments, the length of devices are fixed at 5.0 cm and the aperture area of the cells are obtained from the project area Aproj according to ref. 28–38. As shown in Fig. 2 and parameters summarized in Table 1, while dTiO2 (thickness of TiO2 film) increases from 14 μm to 40 μm, the amount of absorbed dye increases from 9.30 nmol cm−1 to 41.6 nmol cm−1 monotonically. Jsc increases from 8.00 mA cm−2 at dTiO2 of 14 μm to the maximum value of 10.08 mA cm−2 at dTiO2 of 23 μm, then declines to 9.40 mA cm−2 at dTiO2 of 40 μm, which is accompanied by a slight reduction in Voc from 0.713 to 0.683 V and a reduction in FF from 0.713 to 0.664. The η of D-A cells exhibits a maximum value 5.05% at a film thickness of 23 μm. These trends of Voc and FF are attributed to the increase of charge recombination sites and charge transfer resistance caused by the increase of dTiO2, which will result in the decrease of electron lifetime and quasi Fermi level.39–41 As the thickness of TiO2 film increased, the dark current density increased as shown in Fig. 2. For regenerative photo-electrochemical system, the following equation holds:42–44 (1)Here Iinj is the flux of charge resulted from dye sensitized electron injection, ncb is the concentration of electrons at the surface of TiO2, and ket is the rate constant for triiodide reduction. The dark current results from the reduction of triiodide by the conduction band electrons: I3− + 2ecb(TiO2) → 3I−(2)

The triiodide either crosses the dye layer or enters into very small pores where dye cannot penetrate. The thicker the TiO2 film, the more sites there are for I3− to recombine with ecb(TiO2). As a result, the dark current increases as TiO2 film thickness increases according to eqn (2) and these are consistent as the dark current curves show in Fig. 2. This indicates that the rate constant for triiodide reduction is increased as TiO2 film thickness increases, which thus leads to the decrease in the open-circuit voltage according to eqn (1). And this will affect the efficiencies of the devices. Also when dTiO2 exceeds the electron diffuse length and the maximum transmission distance of photons, the photo-electron generation will reach the limit and the electron collection efficiency will decrease.45 As a result, Jsc and η reduce.
3.3 Light focusing effect of circular capillary
Fiber-shaped solar cells encapsulated in capillary tubes have been report in previous work.28,33 The capillary likely acts as a lens and concentrates the light onto the cell. This effect has never been investigated before. As shown in the inset of Fig. 3, we have fabricated the devices, including D-A (in circular capillary), D-B (in rectangular glass slot), and D-C (without sealing tube) solar cells to investigate the light focusing effect of the capillary. Voc, Js, FF and η of the D-A cell reached 0.733 V, 11.64 mA cm−2, 0.684, 5.84%, respectively, and the values for D-B cell are 0.765 V, 9.28 mA cm−2, 0.750, 5.32%, respectively. In contrast, the D-C cell has shown 0.643 V, 3.27 mA cm−2, 0.675, and 1.42% for each of the tested parameters. The conversion efficiency of D-C is far less than the other two types. For D-B and D-C, there is no light focusing effect from the glass tube. Assuming the light adsorption of electrolyte is neglected, the maximum illumination of D-B and D-C is equal to the projection area of fiber cell multiplied by the intensity of incident, meaning their efficiency will be in the same level. However, the efficiency of D-B is much greater than that of D-C, while the efficiency of D-A and D-B are in the same level. So it is concluded that the performances of fiber-cells are improved greatly with capillary sealing, not by the focusing effect of the capillary. On the other hand, in terms of the D-A cell, if we consider that all the light entering the capillary is focused at the fiber cell, then the maximum illumination can be estimated from the diameter of the capillary tube (0.8 mm) and fiber cell (0.3 mm), which is about 1.6 times higher than that of D-B. At the same capacity of light adsorption in the dye molecules, Jsc can increase by 160%. According to the short circuit current enhancement of light focusing effect calculated in ref. 38, the light illumination intensity in the D-A cell increases by 60% only, with the corresponding short circuit current increasing by 60%. But in reality, compared to D-B, the short circuit current in D-A cell only improves by 25% , and the efficiency enhancement is only 9%. Therefore, we believe that the light focusing effect of the circular capillary does help a little to improve the cell performance on some level. However, it is not the dominant factor for the high efficiency of D-A cells. Instead, there are other factors besides the sealing. For example, the electrolytes I3−/I− can absorb visible light (λ ∼ 430 nm).24 However, the light must penetrate the electrolyte before the photons are absorbed by the dye molecules on TiO2 layer, so some of the photons are adsorbed by the electrolyte, leading to photocurrent loss in the DSSC. Also this means the light intensity is weaker, and DSSCs are more efficient under weak illumination.1 Sealing helps to improve efficiency, which is mainly attributed to the suppressing of electrolyte volatilization. For cell D-A and D-B, the amount of I− needed to reduce excited dye to the ground state dye is not only supplied by the reduction of I3−, but also by the excess I− in the capillary and slot, while for cell D-C, since the electrolyte volatilizes and there are no extra store of I−, the amount of I− needed only has to be supplied by the diffusion and reduction of I3−. Hence the contribution of light focusing effect of capillary to the D-A device is small. This result also confirm that it is reasonable to calculate the device efficiency using the projection area of fiber cell, which is widely used in all reported fiber-shaped solar cells as a general method.28–33,35–38 Actually, if taking into account the light blocking of the Pt counter electrode, the real active area is smaller that the projected area of photoanode and the efficiency will be greater than the results demonstrated above.

J–V curves of D-A, D-B, D-C cells under standard illumination. The inset of Fig. 3 shows the different sealing of D-A, D-B, D-C respectively. D-A is sealed in a circular capillary tube. D-B is sealed in a rectangular glass slot, and D-C is not sealed. All cell lengths are 2.00 cm. 
Mass transport equilibrium of various counter electrode twisted pitches
The pitch distance of twisted counter electrode will affect the kinetic behaviors of mass transport process inside the cell. If we define the area of the working electrode that is masked by the counter electrode as Ps, and the rest of working electrode area as PT, then:  where d is the diameter of the counter electrode, Lp is the pitch distance of twisted counter electrode, and D is the diameter of the photo-anode. When d and D are fixed, decreasing Lp will reduce the amount of light adsorption, thus weakening the device Jsc. At fixed Lp and D, increasing d can raise the catalyzed area of the counter electrode and shorten the diffusion distance of I3− to the counter electrode, so the device performance will be improved. Obviously, there is a critical balance between the effect of Lp and d, which will result in stable power output. To confirm these, we have fabricated three cells with d = 40 μm and with different pitch distances, Lp: 173 μm for A1, 296 μm for A2, 586 μm for A3. Also a device named A4 is prepared by placing the Pt wire (the diameter d is 0.1 mm) parallel along with the photo anode in a sealed capillary. The Lp of device A4 can be considered as infinite. For all devices, D is 300 μm and the results of normalized short circuit current Isc–time response curves are show in Fig. 4. Isc of device A1 and A2 rapidly increase to the maximum, and keep at that level for a long time. For example, the values of Isc of A1 and A2 at 60 s are around 96% and 99% of the original value, while that of device A3 is reduced with fluctuation as time goes on and finally at 60 s the value of Isc is 58% of the original value. The Isc of device A4 decreases as soon as the light is switched on, and quickly reaches an equilibrium value that is 53% of the original value. These phenomena result from the mass transport process.46 At the moment of illumination, a large amount of photo-generated electrons are rapidly generated within the conduction band of TiO2 and rapidly transfer to the outside circuit. The Isc increases sharply. Afterwards, the excited dyes are reduced by reacting with I−, producing I3−. Then I3− ions diffuse through the mesoscopic TiO2 film to the surface of Pt electrode, where I3− ions are reduced to I−. I− can diffuse backward into the TiO2 film. The rate constants of ions transport process and photo-electrochemical reaction are different by several orders of magnitude.46,47 If there is not enough I3−/I− supplied in time, the output power will be limited. A greater pitch distance of twisted counter electrode means a longer ion diffusion distance and less catalyzed area to reduce I3−. Under these circumstances, ions will take more time to diffuse before reaction and fewer ions will react at the same time. As the result, the output powers reduce. On the contrary, a smaller pitch distance means a shorter ion diffusion distance and more catalyzed area. As long as the pitch distance is at or less than the critical value, the photochemical cycles of the cell will be reach its equilibrium as soon as the light is switched on and remains at the maximum current value of the device, which Isc reaches up to as soon as the light is on.

Pitch distances of device A1, A2 and A3 are 173 μm, 296 μm, 586 μm, respectively.

Performances of D-A devices with various lengths

Fig. 5(a) and (b) shows the performance of fiber-shaped solar cells with various lengths. The efficiencies decrease slightly at the length range from 3.80 to 9.80 cm. However, the values remain above 5.0%, i.e. the efficiency of a 9.8 cm long device is 5.10%. As the length increases, the short circuit current linearly increases (Fig. 5(a)) and Jsc remains at the same level (Fig. 5(b)), which indicates that the devices can be scaled up as designed, with little sacrifice of their quantum efficiency. However, the Voc and FF decrease slightly when the cell length increases. The parameter variation trends can be interpreted from EIS spectra. Fig. 5(c) shows Nyquist plots of fiber-shaped DSSCs with different lengths under 100 mW cm−2 and forward bias at Voc. The series ohmic resistance (Rs) of substrates and the substrate/TiO2 interface, charge transfer resistance of counter electrode/electrolyte interface (RCT,CE), and electron transfer resistance of working electrode/electrolyte interface (RCT,WE) can be obtained through fitting the modified equivalent circuit shown in the inset of Fig. 5(c).48Fig. 5(d) demonstrates the parameters abstracted from Fig. 5(c). Rs, RCT,CE, RCT,WE decrease slightly as the devices length increases, which results in the cell length effects shown in Fig. 5(a). Overall, highly efficient power output can be guaranteed if we can lower the internal resistance by optimizing the fabrication of TiO2 film and other correlation parameters.

Characteristics of fiber-shaped cells
Due to the 3-D structure, the power output of fiber-shaped solar cell D-A can be greatly improved in diffuse daylight. Fig. 6(a) shows the I–V performance of a 9.50 cm long D-A device under standard illumination condition (SM) and diffuse reflection mode (DRM) without any masking, respectively. Under SM, Voc = 0.734 V, Isc = 3.10 mA (0.326 mA cm−1, 11.06 mA cm−2), FF = 0.672, η = 5.41%, power output = 1.51 mW. It is the longest and most efficient device among all the reported fiber-shaped solar cells as far as we know. What's more, the D-A cell can harvest all light from any direction in the surroundings, due to its capability of 3-D light harvesting. In doing so, a higher power output, especially photocurrent, will be gained. To confirm this feature by experiment, a diffuse light reflector is added underneath the cell, which is called diffuse reflection irradiation mode (DRM). Under DRM, Isc = 6.29 mA (0.662 mA cm−1), which is 2.12 times as high as that under SM, while the power output is 2.61 mW, which is 1.73 times as great as that under SM. These results confirm that our present prototype D-A devices are capable of harvesting light from any direction in the surroundings to generate electricity. This characteristic of fiber cell may find substantial use in real applications. For instance, the device can be used for the indoor electric power generation, where most of the indoor diffuse light can be collected and utilized; in terms of outdoor electric power generation, both incident light and reflected light can used for electricity generation with no tracking hardware needed.

The device is 9.50 cm long and with 21 μm thick TiO2 layer and 270 μm pitch distance. The whole device is under illumination. (b) Normalized Voc, Jsc and efficiency of fiber-shaped solar cell as a function of incident light angles. 
Also D-A cell shows low dependency on incident light angle. That is the cell's output power remains the same regardless of whether the incident light comes from a direction normalized to the twisting axis. Fig. 6(b) shows the I–V performance at different incident light angles, when the incident light's intensity remains the same. As shown in Fig. 6(b), all parameters remain at same value level in the incident angle range of 0° to 180°. The low dependency on incident light angles of D-A cell makes it perfect for electric power generation throughout the day.
Moreover, fiber cells act as units, which can be easily combined in serial or parallel manner by wire connections. Fig. 7 shows the typical I–V curves of two different cells. For cell 1, Voc = 0.753 V, Isc = 2.96 mA, and for cell 2, Voc = 0.735 V, Isc = 3.39 mA. In the parallel connection, Voc = 0.763 V, Isc = 6.11 mA, the total short circuit current being close to the sum (6.35 mA) of that gained from cell 1 and cell 2. In the series connection, Voc = 1.49 V, which is roughly the sum (1.52 V) of those from the two cells. Furthermore, there are other advantages of the fiber cell. The electrolyte solution inside and between the cells can be circulated and replaced via connecting to electrolyte vessels; the defective units in modules can be individually repaired without affecting other cells. The large-scale fiber cells can be woven into textiles to produce a power suit if they are sealed in transparent flexible plastic capillaries. All these unique properties indicate promising applications for large-scale fiber cells.

Conclusions
In this work, high efficiency and large-size fiber-shaped DSSCs are fabricated. In addition to 3-D photon collection, easy fabrication, good supply of raw materials, simple sealing, and the capability of scaling up and modulation, the extraordinary features of these cells may greatly facilitate the application of DSSCs in daily life. It confirms that the light focusing effect of capillaries contributes little to the devices performance. In present work, the power efficiency of a 9.50 cm long fiber cell is 5.41% at 100 mW cm−2 illumination, which is so far the longest and highest efficiency fiber-shaped solar cell. Pt wire is utilized as counter electrode, but it may be substituted by other metals with high catalytic activity, such as platinum coated Ti wire or carbon fibers, thus further lowering the total cost. Moreover, the number of photons adsorbed by electrolyte solution are expected to reduce by optimizing the photo-anode, counter electrode, composition of electrolyte solution or other factors, thus improving the cell performance. In addition, the completely flexible fiber-shape solar cell can be fabricated by replacing glass capillary by transparent and flexible polymer capillary. This permits integration into smart fabrics, power suits and solar modules through weaving technology.34 Further work is still in progress.
