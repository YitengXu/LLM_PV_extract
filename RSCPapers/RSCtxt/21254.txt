    , Accepted 10th March 2014First published on 11th March 2014AbstractA facile and economical MoSe2/Mo structure was in situ prepared to replace the currently preferred expensive Pt and FTO counter electrode (CE) in dye-sensitized solar cells. A power conversion efficiency of 8.13% was achieved, which is comparable to that with Pt-sputtered FTO electrode (8.06%).
A dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) is typically composed of a dye-coated nanocrystalline TiO2 electrode on a fluorine-doped SnO2 (FTO), electrolyte containing the triiodide/iodide redox couple (I3−/I−) and counter electrode (CE). The CE is responsible for transferring electrons from the external circuit to the electrolyte and catalyzing the reduction of I3− to I− in the electrolyte. The conventional CE is a F-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass coated with a platinum (Pt) electrocatalyst, which contributes to a major share of the cost of preparation.1,2 In order to promote the commercialization of DSSCs, it is necessary to explore alternative materials to replace Pt and FTO with low-cost and high-efficiency.
Many candidates have been proposed to replace Pt, such as carbonaceous materials,3,4 metal oxides,5,6 sulfides,7–13 nitrides,14,15etc.16 Recently, the selenides have also been proved to be excellent choices.17–19 MoSe2, one of the important transition metal selenides, is a narrow-band gap semiconductor with a lamellar crystal structure, which has been applied in solar cells and photocatalysis.20–22 MoSe2 has never been introduced into DSSCs as a CE material. On the other hand, in the previous reports, several methods were introduced to prepare CEs, such as spin-coating,3 drop-casting,12 electrochemical deposition,15,17etc. However, the fitted series resistance (Rs) of the CEs, related to the collection of electrons from the external circuit, is usually not low enough to obtain an ideal fill factor (FF) as previously reported, which is partially because of the weak connection between the electrocatalytic layer and the substrate.23 It is highly desirable to explore other effective approaches to prepare CE to obtain lower Rs values for better photovoltaic performance.
In this communication, we proposed a facile and economical MoSe2/Mo counter electrode. The top MoSe2 layer functions as electrocatalytic center for I3− reduction, and the bottom Mo layer acts as conductive collector for electron extraction. The preparation is simple but effective via a strategy of in situ selenization of Mo films on a glass substrate. This method formed a perfect Ohmic contact between the MoSe2 layer and the Mo layer, generating a small Rs. The superior electrocatalytic activity of MoSe2 leads to a low charge-transfer resistance (Rct). As a result, the DSSC assembled using a MoSe2/Mo CE has higher FF and Voc than that with Pt-sputtered FTO. The obtained power conversion efficiency (8.13%) is comparable to the latter (8.06%). Considering the requirement of the selenization process in CIGSSe solar cell fabrication, we further successfully fabricated a bifacial solar cell with front CIGSSe cell and rear DSSC.
Mo thin films were firstly deposited onto the glass substrate by magnetron sputtering. As shown in Fig. 1a, Mo thin film shows a fish scale shape (∼100 nm). The electrical conductivity of the Mo film was measured by a standardized “four-point probe” setup in order to eliminate contact resistance. The Mo thin film provides a superior electrical conductivity of 28.1 μΩ cm. Then, the MoSe2/Mo/glass structure was obtained after annealing the Mo-coated glass substrate at 500 °C for 30 min in a Se atmosphere. As shown in Fig. 1b, a homogeneous and uniform surface was covered by small particles (∼100 nm). The MoSe2 layer was further scraped for transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements. The interlayer d-spacing between the lattice fringes determined to be 3.27 Å is assigned to be the (004) planar spacing (3.23 Å) of MoSe2. Fig. 1c shows the XRD patterns of the MoSe2/Mo structure. The Mo substrate shows a preferred high orientation of the (110) plane, consistent with our former results.24 The Mo peak remains after selenization, indicating partial selenization of the Mo layer, confirming the MoSe2/Mo bilayer structure. The (100) and (110) peaks of MoSe2 are well indexed (JCPDS, PDF no. 29-0914).

The cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image is shown in Fig. 1d. A bilayer structure with 770 nm Mo and 558 nm MoSe2 is presented. Fig. 1e shows the EDS line scan results along the perpendicular direction of the MoSe2/Mo structure (Fig. S1 in the ESI†). No Se element was detected in the bottom Mo layer. The Mo and Se distribute linearly along the scan direction in the transition region between the two layers, which demonstrates that the MoSe2 layer is in intimate contact with the Mo layer. This result coincides well with the cross-sectional SEM results. The formation of MoSe2/Mo structure generates an Ohmic-type contact, which can be explained by the different work functions between the p-type MoSe2 semiconductor (4.4 eV) and the Mo metal (4.6 eV).25 For separate MoSe2 and Mo, the Fermi level of the former is higher than the latter based on the same electronic vacuum energy level. In the MoSe2/Mo bilayer structure where the two have intimate contact, their Fermi level reaches the same level. Herein, as shown in Fig. 1f, the energy band of the MoSe2 semiconductor upsweeps. A highly conductive region is generated, which benefits charge transfer. It is easy for holes to transfer from MoSe2 into Mo.
The MoSe2/Mo structure was used as a CE to assemble the DSSC, as shown in Fig. 2a. The photovoltaic properties of DSSCs with MoSe2/Mo and Pt/FTO CEs under the same illumination are displayed in Fig. 2b and are also summarized in Table 1. The DSSC with MoSe2/Mo CE produces an efficiency of 8.13% (Jsc = 15.07 mA cm2, Voc = 805 mV, and FF = 0.67), which is comparable to that with Pt/FTO CE (η = 8.06%; Jsc = 16.11 mA cm2, Voc = 794 mV, FF = 0.63). For comparison, the MoSe2/Mo CEs have also been prepared for 10 min and 60 min, respectively. The performances of the corresponding DSSCs are shown in Fig. S2 and S3 in the ESI.† The thinner layer leads to the formation of less MoSe2, which is not sufficient for the reduction of I3−. Besides, due to the inherent resistance of MoSe2, a too thick layer is not beneficial for the transfer of the electron. So there is a tradeoff between the resistance of the MoSe2 and the loading amounts of MoSe2. The thickness of 558 nm is an optimal value for the MoSe2 layer in this study.

This is the first investigation to report a MoSe2/Mo CE in a DSSC. In order to evaluate the electrocatalytic activity, the cyclic voltammetry (CV) was measured in a three-electrode system. For comparison, CV of Pt electrode was also performed under the same conditions. As shown in Fig. 2c, both CEs have typical curves with two pairs of redox peaks and two cathodic peaks,10 which are related to the two-step process of I3− reduction denoted in eqn (1) and (2): I3− + 2e− ↔ 3I−(1) 3I2 + 2e− ↔ 2I3−(2)
The similar shape of the curve for the MoSe2/Mo structure to that of Pt/FTO results in a similar electrochemical behavior. Furthermore, the MoSe2/Mo eletrode exhibits higher current density, which reveals a much faster catalytic rate towards the I3−/I− redox couple. MoSe2 is an excellent choice to replace the expensive Pt in DSSC.
In order to further evaluate the electrochemical characteristics, the electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) measurements were carried out using symmetric cells fabricated using two identical electrodes (CE/electrolyte/CE). The obtained Nyquist plots conducted in the dark without bias potential are illustrated in Fig. 2d. Two semicircles in the high and low-frequency regions are observed for all the CEs. The intercept of the semicircle in the high-frequency region on the real axis is assigned to the Ohmic series resistance (Rs). The semicircle in the high-frequency range of the Nyquist plot is related to the charge-transfer resistance (Rct) of I3− reduction.23,26Rs and Rct are evaluated by fitting the impedance spectra with the equivalent circuit (Fig. S4 in the ESI†) using the Zview software. Rs is related to the collection of electrons from the external circuit. Generally, Rs increases with the surface area of the CE and is reversely proportional to the FF.27,28 As listed in Table 1, the obtained Rs value of the MoSe2/Mo CE (2.64 Ω) is only 16.5% of Pt/FTO (15.98 Ω). Rct, crucial to the electron transfer, is correlated with the interface between the electrolyte and the CE. Rct of MoSe2/Mo CE is (0.30 Ω) is 3.35% of Pt/FTO (8.95 Ω), further indicating superior electrocatalytic activity of MoSe2 for the reduction of I3−.
Bifacial solar cell, which can converts light into electricity at both sides of the cell, is also an economical choice and has promising applications.29,30 The selenization process is an improtant process in fabricating CIGSSe solar cells. The application of MoSe2/Mo structure as CE in DSSC makes possible a bifacial cell consisting of a CIGSSe solar cell as the front cell for absorbing intense sunlight and DSSC as the rear one for weak irradiation. Mo was sputtered onto both sides of the glass substrate followed by selenization. After this, one side was for CIGSSe cell and the other was for DSSC. A bifacial solar cell was successfully fabricated (Fig. S5 in the ESI†).
In summary, sputtered Mo on glass substrates was in situ selenized to synthesize a MoSe2/Mo bilayer structure. The obtained MoSe2/Mo electrode was successfully introduced into DSSC as CE to substitute the expensive Pt/FTO electrode. CV and EIS measurements demonstrate the superior electrocatalytic activity of the MoSe2/Mo structure in the reduction of I3−. A power conversion efficiency of 8.13% was obtained, which is comparable to that with Pt-sputtered FTO (8.06%). Using this application, we further successfully fabricated a bifacial solar cell with a front CIGSSe cell and rear DSSC.
