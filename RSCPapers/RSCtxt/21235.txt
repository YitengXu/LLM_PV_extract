, Accepted 10th June 2015First published on 15th June 2015AbstractAdsorption of the colorless 1,3-bis(dicyanomethylidene)indane (BDMI) onto a nanocrystalline TiO2 surface unusually turned the BDMI a deep blue color. Upon contact of the BDMI-adsorbed TiO2 (BDMI-TiO2) with an iodide-based redox electrolyte, a photocurrent density as high as 14.9 mA cm−2 was generated with a photovoltage of 0.42 V, leading to a power conversion efficiency of 3.63%. This unprecedented photovoltaic performance was simultaneously investigated by spectroscopic studies of BDMI-TiO2 films and density functional theory (DFT)/time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) computational approaches for [BDMI]−[Ti(OH)3·H2O]+ (1) as a simple model compound to inspect the light to current conversion abilities. All these results established that the color change from colorless to deep blue and the highly efficient photocurrent generation through binding on the TiO2 surface originates from interfacial charge transfer transitions from anionic BDMI to TiO2.
Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have attracted considerable attention in the past two decades due to their low-cost and colorful appearance.1 Propelled by continuous developments for sensitizers and electrolytes as well as device engineering,2–4 an efficiency exceeding 12% was reported based on the donor–pi-bridge–acceptor zinc(II) porphyrin and phthalo-cyanine sensitizer.5,6 Metal-free organic dyes have also been actively explored for DSSCs because of their high molar extinction coefficients and facile modification of optical transition energy gap.7–10 Narrow band gap organic dyes have been thus designed and studied to harvest broad absorption from visible to near infrared (NIR) light. Despite enormous molecular engineering of squaraine (SQ)11–13 and bora-diazaindacene (BODIPY),14,15 the conversion efficiencies of organic compounds as NIR light absorbing materials for the improvement of DSSC performance were lower than expected. Moreover, multi-synthetic procedures make the further study of those materials difficult.
Recently it was reported that formation of the complex between 7,7,8,8-tetracyano-quinodimethane (TCNQ) and TiO2 nanoparticles showed new visible light absorption bands, which were interpreted by interfacial charge transfer transitions from the TCNQ to the conduction band of TiO2.16,17 Direct transition from the ground state of TCNQ to the conduction band of TiO2 is quite different from the usual transition mechanism of excitation followed by injection in DSSCs. Since direct transition between the dye and TiO2 depends on the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of the dye and the conduction band edge of TiO2, rather than the gap between HOMO and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), band gap engineering of the dye is not necessarily required. This advantage of the charge transfer complex system motivated us to explore new complex systems.
We have considered 1,3-bis(dicyanomethylidene)indane (BDMI) as a charge transfer complex because BDMI was applied to nonlinear optical (NLO) materials and light-emitting diodes owing to its strong electron acceptor characteristics.18,19 We herein demonstrate that colorless BDMI turns blue when it is adsorbed on a TiO2 surface and the interfacial charge transfer transition generates a high photocurrent of ca. 14.9 mA cm−2. To understand the chemical bonding nature between BDMI and TiO2 and the origin of their photocurrent conversion abilities, Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy and ultra-violet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) of BDMI adsorbed TiO2 film with density functional theory (DFT)/time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) computational studies of a model compound are investigated.
Results and discussion
Experimental absorption and FT-IR spectra
 BDMI can be readily adsorbed onto a TiO2 surface by immersion of the annealed TiO2 film in a BDMI acetonitrile solution at room temperature for 20 min. Interestingly, the BDMI adsorbed TiO2 (BDMI-TiO2) film shows a remarkable deep blue color although the mother BDMI solution is colorless because of a lack of absorption bands in the visible region as shown in Fig. 1(a). Compared to free BDMI, the lowest absorption maximum at 560 nm for BDMI-TiO2 is red-shifted by 220 nm which may be attributed to adsorption of the deprotonated anionic BDMI composition. As recently reported by Heo et al., blue anionic dyes are generated by deprotonation of BDMI in polar solvents which also shows a strong absorption band around 580 nm similar to BDMI-TiO2.20 In addition, the FT-IR spectra of free BDMI and BDMI-TiO2 also show a clear difference in the CN stretching mode. As shown in Fig. 1(b), a single CN stretching peak of free BDMI at 2225 cm−1 is split into two peaks at 2191 and 2337 cm−1, which indicates that the BDMI-TiO2 surface complex forms on the TiO2 surface.

Electrochemical properties
To assess the suitability of blue colored organic–inorganic hybrid dyes for electrochemical solar cells, the electrochemical behavior of the BDMI-TiO2 surface complex was investigated by ultra-violet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) to determine its ionization energy. From the onset energy of the photo electron ionization energy for BDMI-TiO2 as shown in Fig. 2(a), the HOMO energy level is calculated to be −5.80 eV. The LUMO energy level is estimated to be ca. −3.80 eV by optical energy gap. As shown in Fig. 2(b), the energy level diagram of the BDMI-TiO2 reveals the favorable energy level matching at the interfaces between TiO2 (conduction band: −4.00 eV)21 and absorbed BDMI and I3−/I− redox couple (−4.90 eV).22 Therefore, the oxidized organic–inorganic BDMI-TiO2 surface complex can be expected to thermodynamically accept electrons from the I− anion and causing photo to current conversion.

Photovoltaic properties in a DSSC
The photovoltaic performance is evaluated using the 11.8 μm-thick TiO2 film and the redox electrolyte comprising 1.0 M LiI and 0.025 M I2 in acetonitrile. Fig. 3 shows the photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves measured under AM 1.5G one sun illumination (100 mW cm−2). Photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1. The BDMI sensitized DSSC yields a notably high photocurrent density (Jsc) of 14.9 mA cm−2 with an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.42 V and a fill factor (FF) of 0.57, leading to a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 3.63%. The incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) for the BDMI sensitized DSSC in Fig. 4 is remarkably as high as 62% over the wavelength ranging from 500 nm to 700 nm. Onset wavelength of about 800 nm, corresponding to 1.55 eV, is indicative of interfacial charge transfer from anionic BDMI to TiO2. To understand the chemical bonding between BDMI and TiO2, the photovoltaic performance is tested with BDMI derivatives such as 2-ethoxymethylene-1,3-bis(dicyanomethylidene)indane (BDMI-OEt),23 1,3-indandione (IDN) and 2-ethoxymethylene-1,3-indanone (IDN-OEt). However, BDMI-OEt is inactive and IDN and IDN-OEt show extremely low efficiencies. This result gives some important insight into the relationship between chemical bonding characteristics and charge transfer between anionic organic chromophores and inorganic TiO2 surface.

DFT computational studies
For the understanding of the BDMI-TiO2 surface complex, the contribution of anionic dyes formed by deprotonation of BDMI should be taken into account.20 Such a simple model has been applied to be useful for understanding of the interfacial charge-transfer transitions between TiO2 and molecular absorbates.17,24 Therefore, the computational studies are based on [BDMI]−[Ti(OH)3·H2O]+ (1) as a model compound to inspect the spectral change for BDMI-TiO2. The optimized geometric structure of 1 is provided in the ESI.†Fig. 5(a) shows the surfaces and energies of frontier molecular orbitals (FMOs) for 1 in ground states. The HOMO and LUMO levels are mainly populated on the π–π* orbitals for the anionic BDMI component with a marginally combined oxygen atom of a Ti(OH)3(H2O)+ fragment, while the LUMO+1 and LUMO+2 levels are localized entirely on the d orbitals of the titanium metal center. Compared to free BDMI, the complexation of anionic BDMI and cationic Ti(OH)3(H2O)+ in Fig. 5(b) causes destabilization of both HOMO and LUMO energy levels but is more pronounced at the HOMO levels, thus also leading to a narrow HOMO–LUMO optical energy gap.
 Fig. 5  (a) Isodensity surface plots and energies for FMOs of complex 1 in the ground state (isodensity contour = 0.01 au). (b) Total density of states (DOS) of the geometrically optimized BDMI and complex 1. 
The simulated absorption spectra of complex 1 in Fig. 6(a) also agree well with the experimental data of the BDMI-TiO2 film, which gives rise to the color change from colorless to deep blue for BDMI-TiO2 as shown in Fig. 1(a). Obviously, the S0 → S1 vertical excitation at 520.9 nm involves primarily transitions from HOMO → LUMO with a moderate oscillator strength (f = 0.0952) in Table 2. From the transition configurations and their FMOs in Fig. 5(a), there is evidence that the formation and adsorption of the anionic BDMI component have a significant impact in the color change from colorless to deep blue. Although the charge separation for complex 1 is relatively limited in this long wavelength region, the electron density of interfacing cyano (CN) functional group for the anionic BDMI is decreased while the charge density of the combined oxygen atoms for Ti(OH)3(H2O)+ is enhanced (Fig. 6(b)). In addition, the charge transfer from anionic BDMI to Ti(OH)3(H2O)+ can be identified clearly by the calculated absorption band in the 300–400 nm region because this mainly consists of the electron transition with HOMO → LUMO+1 and HOMO−1 → LUMO. Based on these results and experimental results of the BDMI-TiO2 film, we here tentatively conclude that the adsorbed anionic BDMI onto TiO2 can induce efficient light to current conversion with high IPCE values by interfacial charge.

To further understand the chemical bonding nature between BDMI and TiO2, the frequency calculation for the optimized structure of complex 1 was investigated (Fig. 7). The calculated vibrational spectra shows the four CN vibrational modes at 2170, 2307, 2319, and 2335 cm−1 well. Especially, the intense signal at 2170 cm−1 is assigned to the asymmetric stretching mode for the CN functional group of anionic BDMI. Although the calculated CN stretching energies show slight deviations in the range of 2–20 cm−1 compared to BDMI-TiO2, the trend is in good agreement with the experimental results. Thus the two CN vibrational signals for BDMI-TiO2 are indicative of interfacial adsorption of anionic BDMI onto the TiO2 surface.

Experimental
Materials
All reagents were obtained from Aldrich, Fluka, and Tokyo Chemical Industry (TCI), unless otherwise specified, as received without further purification. 2-Ethoxymethylene-1,3-bis(dicyanomethylidene)indane (BDMI-OEt) was synthesized according to a literature procedure.23 Flash column chromatography was carried out on silica-gel (Merck; silica-gel 60, 230–400 mesh). Anatase TiO2 nanoparticles were synthesized by acetic acid via the catalyzed hydrolysis of titanium isopropoxide (97%, Aldrich), followed by autoclaving at 170 °C for 12 h. An aqueous solvent in the autoclaved TiO2 colloid solution was replaced by ethanol for preparation of non aqueous TiO2 paste. Ethyl cellulose (Aldrich), lauric acid (Fluka) and terpineol (Aldrich) were added into the ethanol solution of the TiO2 particles, and then ethanol was removed from the solution using a rotary evaporator to obtain viscous pastes. For homogeneous mixing, the paste was further treated with three-roll mill. The nominal composition of TiO2/terpineol/ethylcellulose/lauric acid was 1.25/4/0.3/0.1.
General characterization methods
The chemical structures of the materials used in this study were identified by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were recorded on a Varian Unity inova 300 MHz spectrometer. 1H NMR spectra were referenced to tetramethylsilane (TMS, 0.00 ppm) using CDCl3 as solvent. 13C NMR spectra were referenced to solvent carbons (77.16 ppm for CDCl3). High resolution mass spectra which were recorded on a JEOL Ltd JMS-700 mstation obtained by FAB and reported in units of mass to charge (m/z). The absorption and photoluminescence spectra were recorded on an Agilent 8453 UV-visible spectroscopy and a Riken-Keiki fluorescence spectrometer, respectively.
Fabrication and characterization of dye-sensitized solar cells
FTO glasses (Pilkington, TEC-8, 8 Ω sq−1) were washed in ethanol using an ultrasonic bath for 10 min. The FTO layer was first covered with 0.1 M Ti(IV) bis(ethyl acetoacetato)diiso-propoxide (Aldrich) in 1-butanol (Aldrich) solution by a spin-coating method, on which the nanocrystalline TiO2 paste was deposited using a doctor-blade technique. After the TiO2 films were heated at 550 °C for 1 h, the sides of the TiO2 films were trimmed to 9 mm wide and 5 mm long. The thickness of the TiO2 films was measured by an Alpha step profiler (KLA-Tencor). The annealed TiO2 electrodes were immersed in ethanol containing 3.0 mM photosensitizer for 20 min at room temperature. Pt counter electrodes were prepared by spreading a droplet of 7 mM H2PtCl6 in 2-propanol on top of a FTO substrate and heating at 400 °C for 20 min. The two electrodes were sealed with 60 μm thick Surlyn (Solaronix). Redox electrolyte was introduced through a small hole drilled in the counter electrode. The electrolyte employed was a solution of 1.00 M lithium iodide (LiI) and 0.025 M iodine (I2) in acetonitrile. Photocurrent and voltage were measured from a solar simulator (Oriel Sol 3A class AAA) equipped with a 450 W Xenon lamp (Newport 6279NS) and a Keithley 2400 source meter. Light intensity was adjusted with the NREL-calibrated Si solar cell with a KG-2 filter for approximating one sun illumination (100 mW cm−2). The cell was covered with an aperture black mask to measure photocurrent and voltage accurately. The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra was measured as a function of wavelength from 300 to 800 nm under DC measurement mode using a specially designed IPCE system (PV Measurements, Inc.), where a 75 W Xe light source was used for monochromatic light. The absorbance of photosensitizers was recorded by a UV-Vis spectrophotometer (Agilent 8453) in the wavelength range of 300–800 nm. Impedance spectra were recorded using a Autolab (AUT128N, FRA2) electrochemical station under one sun illumination with a frequency range of 0.1 Hz to 100 kHz.

1,3-Indandione (IDN) (300 mg, 2.053 mmol) and triethyl orthoformate (1.130 mL, 6.794 mmol) were dissolved in 10 mL of acetic anhydride. The mixture was heated at 80 °C for 3 h. After removing solvent under reduced pressure, the residue was recrystallized by anhydrous diethyl ether at −24 °C to obtain IDN-OEt (220 mg, 1.109 mmol) in 53% yield as a bright red solid. 1H NMR (300 MHz, CDCl3): δ 7.92–7.87 (m, 2H, Ar), 7.76–7.71 (m, 2H, Ar), 7.68 (s, 1H, CH), 4.47 (q, J3 = 6.9 Hz, 2H, –CH2–), 1.52 (t, J3 = 7.2 Hz, 3H, –CH3). 13C NMR (75 MHz, CDCl3): δ 190.9, 188.1, 163.1, 141.3, 140.4, 134.8, 134.4, 122.9, 122.7, 112.5, 74.9, 15.6. ESI-HRMS (positive) calcd for [C12H10O3]+ 201.0630 found 201.0624.
Computational methods
The computational calculations were performed by the Gaussian 09, revision B.0125 software package and the High Performance Computing Virtual Laboratory (HPCVL) at Queen's University. All of the optimization procedures were performed in vacuum at the B3LYP26,27 level using LANL2DZ basis set for titanium metal28 and 6-31G(d) basis set for all other atoms.29 Frequency calculations at the same level for [BDMI]−[Ti(OH)3·H2O]+ (1) as a simple model complex were investigated to confirm the BDMI binding modes for TiO2 surface and each stationary point to be a true energy minimum. The lowest ten singlet excited states for 1 and their electronic absorption spectra were calculated with the charge-transfer transitions TD-DFT30–32 on the basis of the optimized ground-state geometries. The electron density differences between the ground state (S0) and the first excited state (S1) were calculated to evaluate effective charge separation.
Conclusions
We have explored charge transfer complex by binding the colorless BDMI on a TiO2 surface. The absorption transition from UV to Visible by complexation produced photocurrent and photovoltage. We have investigated spectroscopic and computational studies for the BDMI-TiO2 surface complex. Their broad band absorption spectra in the range of 450–750 nm were due to the interfacial charge transfer transitions from BDMI to TiO2, associated with chemical bonding between anionic BDMI and the cationic surface of TiO2. The BDMI-TiO2 surface complex was deep blue in color and yielded a photocurrent density as high as 14.9 mA cm−2 and efficiency of 3.63% under AM 1.5G one sun illumination (100 mW cm−2).
