    , Accepted 11th December 2021First published on 13th December 2021AbstractApplying non-precious metal catalysts to electrocatalytic CO2 reduction (CO2R) to CO efficiently, rather than gold-based nanomaterials, is of practical significance. Here, we adopt zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) to assist the synthesis of Fe metal catalysts with various sizes, ranging from single atoms to over 100 nm. As a result, the CO2 reduction performance of Fe metal catalysts with different particle sizes is different. Dominantly, Fe single-atomic sites exhibit optimum activity in producing CO, presenting a current density of 46.5 mA cm−2, with nearly 100% faradaic efficiency (FE) for CO (at −0.9 V vs. RHE), while the result for 7.6 nm Fe nanoparticles is slightly lower (ca. 92%). With further increasing the Fe particle size, the CO2RR performance weakens and allows the H2 evolution reaction (HER), which demonstrates the size-dependent selectivity of iron-based electrocatalysts for electrochemical CO2 reduction. Operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy revealed the active sites to be discrete Fe2+ ions, coordinated to the pyrrolic nitrogen (N) atoms of the N-doped carbon support.
Introduction
With the continued use of traditional fossil fuels, the concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere has gradually increased, leading to adverse global climate and environmental problems.1–3 Electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 under ambient conditions not only effectively reduces anthropogenic CO2 emission,4 but also stores intermittent renewable energy such as wind and solar power,5–7 in the form of carbon-based fuels and chemicals,8–11 which has received tremendous attention. However, it remains an outstanding challenge to achieve efficient electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) due to the difficulty in controlling selectivity and the requirement of a large overpotential caused by the thermally stable CO2 molecule and the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in aqueous solution.12–15 Therefore, electrocatalysts with high product selectivity, high activity and good stability for high-performance CO2RR are urgent to be extensively explored.16,17 Of the various reaction pathways possible, CO2 conversion into CO has attracted much attention for its usage in the production of a wide range of industrial chemicals such as methane,18 ethylene,19n-propanol20 and so on.21 Numerous electrocatalysts have been developed for CO production,22,23 among which gold (Au)24 and silver (Ag)25 are the most efficient at low overpotentials. However, the high price of precious metal catalysts has limited their further development. Design and development of cheap, efficient, and abundant catalysts are therefore highly desirable for the CO2RR.26
Recently, single-atom catalysts (SACs) have emerged as a new research frontier of heterogeneous catalysis, representing the lowest size limit to obtain the maximum atom efficiency with the active sites dispersed at the atomic level.27–32 Benefiting from the well-defined active centers,33 the monodisperse metal atoms in SACs have higher coordination unsaturation and more homogeneous structure.34 Thus, compared with traditional heterogeneous catalysts, SACs are excellent candidates towards the CO2RR to reduce the diversity of reaction paths or weaken the HER, possessing ultrahigh catalytic activity and selectivity for reducing CO2 to CO.35–38 In particular, single-atom metal decorated N-doped carbon materials exhibit ideal catalytic performance in the CO2RR by forming different structures with nitrogen moieties to stabilize single atoms and adjust catalytic properties.
For example, Fe single atoms (SAs) coordinated to the pyrrolic nitrogen atoms of the N-doped carbon support have achieved outstanding activity and exclusive selectivity towards CO2 electroreduction to CO.39,40 Motivated by the superior performance of Fe based catalysts and research on the influence of size, herein, we prepared Fe metal catalysts with a series of various sizes across N-doped carbon substrates through a facile pyrolysis of the Fe-doped zinc (Zn) 2-methylimidazolate framework (ZIF-8). Then we investigated the influence of the size of Fe metal on the CO2 electroreduction activity and, especially, on product selectivity. Subsequent evaluation of the resulting CO2RR performances indicates a notable size-dependent selectivity of iron-based electrocatalysts for electrochemical CO2 reduction and it is discussed in detail in the following section.
Experimental section
Materials
Ferric nitrate nonahydrate (Fe(NO3)3·9H2O), zinc nitrate hexahydrate (Zn(NO3)2·6H2O), 2-methyl imidazole (2-MeIM), potassium bicarbonate (KHCO3) and methanol (MeOH) were all purchased from Titan Scientific Co., Ltd. Nafion was supplied by Sigma-Aldrich. All chemicals were of analytical grade and used directly without additional treatment.
Synthesis of ZIF-8
The preparation of ZIF-8 followed previously reported synthetic procedures. First, Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (0.558 g) and 2-MeIM (0.616 g) were dissolved separately in 15 mL methanol. Then, the two solutions were mixed together under ultrasound for 15 min at room temperature. The white suspension obtained by ultrasound was left at room temperature under static conditions overnight to grow ZIF-8. The precipitate was centrifuged and washed three times with methanol. Finally, the product was dried in a vacuum at 60 °C for 12 h.
Synthesis of Fe SAs
In a normal procedure, 100 mg of the as-obtained ZIF-8 powder was dispersed into methanol (15 mL) under ultrasound for 5 min at room temperature. Next, Fe(NO3)3 aqueous solution(100 mg mL−1, 50 μL) was slowly added to the mixed solution dropwise under stirring at room temperature. The mixture was kept under stirring for 24 h so that the ferric salts were absorbed completely. Afterwards, the above mixture was centrifuged and dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C for 12 h. The samples were transferred into a porcelain boat and heated in a tubular furnace to 1000 °C (heating rate 5 °C min−1) for 2 h under an Ar atmosphere (40 mL min−1). The catalyst was further subjected to acid washing by sonicating it in 10 mL of 1 M hydrochloric acid (HNO3, 10 hours) to remove extra-large-sized Fe nanoparticles. Then, it was centrifuged and dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C for 12 h. Fe SAs/N–C was obtained as a black powder.
Synthesis of Fe NPs
The synthesis of Fe NPs was similar to that of Fe SAs, except that the volume of Fe(NO3)3 added in the above process was adjusted and the pickling steps after removing the product from the tube furnace were removed. For clarity, we named different-size Fe NPs by their average particle sizes. For instance, Fe NPs with an average size of 7.6 nm were named 7.6 Fe NPs. In this work, via changing the volume of 100 mg mL−1 Fe(NO3)3 implanted into ZIF-8 to 100 μL, 400 μL, 600 μL and 5 mL respectively, three corresponding samples were obtained, which were 7.6 Fe NPs, 16.7 Fe NPs, 44.8 Fe NPs and oversized Fe NPs. ZIF-8 N-doped carbon substrates were prepared through pyrolysis of ZIF-8 powder directly in a tubular furnace with the same heating procedure of Fe SAs as above.
Physicochemical characterization
The composition of the synthesized and reduced materials was determined by X-ray-diffraction (XRD). The XRD patterns were recorded by using a Germany Bruker D8 advance X-ray diffractometer using nickel filtered Cu Kα (λ = 1.54178 ÅÅ) radiation with a scanning angle (2θ) of 20°–80°, a scanning speed of 2° min−1, and a voltage and current of 40 kV and 40 mA. XPS spectra were acquired on a thermo ESCALAB 250 with Al Kα (h λ = 1486.6 eV) as the excitation source. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was performed by using a ZEISS Merlin Compact Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope with an acceleration voltage of 5 kV. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) characterization experiments were carried out using a Tecani-G2 T20 and F20 operating at an acceleration voltage of 200 kV. The Fe SAs were imaged with high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM). The HAADF-STEM images were obtained by using a scanning/transmission electron microscope operated at 300 kV, and equipped with a probe spherical aberration corrector.
Inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS)
The iron concentrations of the samples were measured on an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (NexION 300D). Commercially, 1000 mg L−1 ferric nitrate standard solution was used for calibration. The standards were diluted to 1000 ppb (ng g−1), 500 ppb, 100 ppb, 50 ppb, and 1 ppb, respectively, with 5 v/v% HNO3 solution to establish the calibration curves. All samples were dissolved in concentrated HNO3 and then diluted to a concentration of 5% with DI water. Fe SA samples were diluted 100 times, while Fe NP samples were diluted 200 times, using 5% HNO3 solution for measurements.
X-ray absorption spectroscopy measurements
X-ray absorption spectroscopy studies including X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) analysis at the Fe K-edge in fluorescence mode under ambient conditions were performed at the BL14W1 beamline at the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF). The electron beam energy was 3.5 GeV and the stored current was 230 mA (top-up). A 38-pole wiggler with a maximum magnetic field of 1.2 T inserted in the straight section of the storage ring was used. The XAFS data were collected using a fixed-exit double-crystal Si(111) monochromator. The fluorescence signals of Fe were collected using a Lytle detector. The energy was calibrated using Fe foil.
The operando XAS spectra were collected with a home-made cell under the same conditions as those used for the electrochemical measurements. For the operando measurements, 0.5 M aqueous KHCO3 was used as the electrolyte, and Ag/AgCl and Pt were used as the reference and counter electrodes, respectively. A 1 cm × 1 cm piece of the hydrophobic carbon paper with a catalyst loading of 2 mg cm−2 was used as the working electrode. During the measurements, each applied potential was maintained for at least 30 min before the collection of spectra to ensure the stability of the current.
The raw data were analyzed using the IFEFFIT software package according to the standard data analysis procedures. The spectra were calibrated, averaged, pre-edge background subtracted, and post-edge normalized using the Athena program in the IFEFFIT software package. The Fourier transformation of the k3-weighted EXAFS oscillations, k3·χ(k), from k space to R space was performed to obtain a radial distribution function. The data fitting was performed using the Artemis program in the IFEFFIT software package.
The Fe K-edge XANES simulation was conducted with the FDMNES code in multiple scattering mode using the muffin-tin potential. Parameter optimization was performed by comparing the theoretical and experimental spectra to acquire the most appropriate convolution parameters.
Electrochemical measurements
Electrochemical measurements were carried out in a customized flow-type electrolytic cell with gas diffusion electrodes, separating the cathode from the anode with the Nafion 117 proton exchange membrane. The experiment was conducted in CO2-saturated 0.5 M KHCO3 solution under room temperature and atmospheric pressure with a three electrode system, a Pt foil electrode as the counter electrode and an Ag/AgCl electrode filled with a saturated KCl solution as the reference electrode. The working electrode was prepared as follows: typically, 10 mg of the as-obtained catalyst was dispersed in the mixed solution of isopropanol(960 μL) and Nafion 117 solution(5%, 40 μL) under ultrasonic treatment for 15 minutes to form a uniform ink solution. 100 μL of ink solution was equably sprayed on the hydrophilic side of carbon fiber paper (1 × 1 cm2) with a mass loading of 1 mg cm−2 and then it was dried in a vacuum. All potentials controlled by the electrochemical workstation were then converted to a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) scale, and were calculated as E vs. RHE = E vs. Ag/AgCl + 0.1989 V + 0.0592 V × pH. The supporting electrolyte in the electrolytic cell was 0.5 M KHCO3 solution (saturated with CO2) by blowing high-purity CO2 into the KHCO3 solution at a flow rate of 5 mL min−1 for at least 0.5 h, the PH value of which was approximately 7. During the experiment, CO2 gas (99.99%) was delivered into the cathode with an average rate of 5 mL min−1 measured with a universal gas-flow meter. The gas phase product was sent to a gas chromatograph (GC) connected with a closed electrochemical flow cell online for in situ analysis. The Porapark Q and 5A packed column with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) was used to analyze CO2, CO and H2. The HP-AL/M column with a flame ionization detector (FID) was used to analyze hydrocarbons in the gas phase. Liquid products were quantified by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) (Agilent 1260) analysis after the electrolysis was finished. The column used was an Aminex HPX 87-H (Bio-Rad) and diluted sulfuric acid (1 mM) was used as the eluent. The temperature of the column was maintained at 40 °C in a column oven, and the separated compounds were detected with a refractive index detector (RID).

Results and discussion
A synthesis schematic of Fe SAs on N-doped carbon substrates is illustrated in Fig. 1. Firstly, ZIF-8 was synthesized through a modified method referring to a previously reported study16,17 and it exhibits a uniform rhombododecahedral shape (Fig. S2†). After mixing the Fe(NO3)3 solution with ZIF-8, the resulting solution was centrifuged, and then the obtained powder was calcined at 1000 °C under the protection of an Ar atmosphere for 2 hours. At such a high temperature, ZIF-8 was transformed into a N-doped carbon skeleton and the zinc node with a low boiling point of 907 °C would evaporate, which resulted in the formation of an Fe based N-doped carbon (Fe–N–C) catalyst. Full experimental procedures to synthesize the Fe SAs, Fe Nanoparticles (Fe NPs) and ZIF-8 N-doped carbon substrates are provided in detail in the Experimental section.
 Fig. 1  Schematic representation of the Fe SA synthesis process. 
The ZIF-8 derived carbon and Fe catalyst with various sizes were examined by XRD. It can be seen that there is no zinc-related peak observed in the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns and no visible Fe peak (located at 44.7°) is present for Fe SAs, 7.6 Fe NPs, 16.7 Fe NPs or pyrolyzed ZIF-8. As the particle size increases further, the peak of Fe becomes stronger and sharper due to the increase in the quantity of corresponding crystal materials (Fig. 2a). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to investigate the chemical composition and elemental state of Fe SAs. The high-resolution XPS Fe 2p spectrum (Fig. S1b†) of Fe SAs shows that the Fe 2p3/2 binding energy is 710.9 eV, which is very close to that for Fe2O3 (710.6 eV), indicating the positive trivalent oxidation states of Fe single atoms. The N 1s spectrum (Fig. 2b) deconvoluted into pyridinic (∼398.3 eV), N–Fe (∼399.6 eV), pyrrolic (∼400.4 eV), quaternary (∼401.2 eV) and oxidized (∼402.9 eV) N species16,17 and the major peak at 398.6 eV was assigned to pyrrolic N coordinated to Fe. Furthermore, more detailed structural information about Fe SAs can be obtained from the synchrotron-based X-ray absorption near-edge spectra (XANES) and extended X-ray fine structure (EXAFS). According to the fitting results in R space Fe K-edge EXAFS spectra (Fig. 2c), the dominant Fe–N coordination with a peak at 1.42 Å confirms the atomic dispersion of Fe sites in Fe SAs. As seen in the position of the rising edge of the Fe K-edge XANES (Fig. 2d), the binding and edge energies of Fe SAs resemble those of Fe2O3. Thus, we conclude that the oxidation state of the Fe atoms in Fe SAs is +3, which justifies XPS results.

To reveal the morphological and structural features of the Fe SAs, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were performed. The N-doped carbon substrates, the product of ZIF-8 carbonized at high temperature, retain the original size distribution and truncated rhombic dodecahedral morphology of the starting polyhedral as presented in Fig. S4a† and 3a. In order to reveal the morphology and structural characteristics of Fe SAs, aberration-corrected high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) was performed. The circled isolated bright spots indicate that Fe species are atomically dispersed on the N-doped carbon structure, with the corresponding HAADF-STEM images shown in Fig. 3b. Moreover, the energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) maps (Fig. 3c) also reveal the homogeneous distribution of Fe species throughout the N-doped carbon matrix. Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) analysis demonstrated the actual weight fractions of Fe to be 0.25% and the characteristic peaks of Fe crystals didn't appear in the XRD patterns of Fe SAs from Fig. 2a.

With the increment of Fe content, a set of obvious diffraction peaks of Fe emerged at 44.7° accordingly (Fig. 2a), indicating the formation of Fe NPs rather than Fe SAs. The enlargement of particle size was observed evidently from the TEM images displayed in Fig. S4.† Further, the detailed microstructure observation by high resolution TEM (Fig. 4e–g) confirmed the lattice fringe spacing of Fe NPs with each size, which is identified with the (101) plane. At the same time, with the increase of the Fe(NO3)3 dosage, the initial rhombic dodecahedron structure collapses gradually and evolves into a porous structure (Fig. S3†). Fig. 4d exhibits the frequency histograms of size distribution for Fe NPs with Fe loadings of 1.6%, 7.2% and 10.5%, determined by measuring about 200 random particles on the images. 100 μL Fe(NO3)3 was added to form 7.6 Fe NPs with an average size of 7.6 nm, 400 μL Fe(NO3)3 was used to generate 16.7 Fe NPs with a mean size of 16.7 nm and the formation of 44.8 Fe NPs was a result of 600 μL Fe(NO3)3 added. Besides, combined with EDS mappings of different-size Fe NPs (Fig. 4a–c), it was found that Fe and N were uniformly dispersed on the carbon structure. 5 mL Fe(NO3)3 injected into the methanol solution of ZIF-8 led to the formation of oversized Fe NPs, whose average diameters were over 100 nm, as seen in Fig. S4e.†

The electrocatalytic activities of the Fe–N–C catalysts for CO2 reduction were tested in CO2-saturated 0.5 M KHCO3 electrolyte using a flow cell with a three-electrode configuration at ambient temperature and pressure. According to the results of cyclic voltammetry (CV) of Fe SAs (Fig. S6†), with the negative shift of potential, the cathode current density was enhanced and Fe SAs under CO2-saturated conditions exhibited a more positive potential (about −0.5 V vs. RHE) and higher current density compared to N2-saturated conditions, showing its effective CO2 reduction performance. The linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curve of Fe SAs (Fig. 5a) and Fe NPs with varying sizes suggested that Fe SAs presented an ultrahigh electrocatalytic activity, whose CO2RR current density increased approximately linearly and reached a high value of 50 mA cm−2 at −1.1 V vs. RHE (Fig. 5d). In addition, when the size of Fe NPs increased, there was a decrease in current density but a higher cathodic onset potential, especially for oversized NPs, whose current density increased very slightly and required a larger overpotential for CO2 reduction in the meanwhile (Fig. 5a).

(b) The corresponding FECO at different applied potentials. (c) The optimal FECO of Fe SAs and different-size Fe NPs. (d) CO partial current density (JCO) and (e) TOFs at different applied potentials. (f) Stability of Fe SAs at −0.9 V vs. RHE for 18 h continuous electrolysis. 
To further obtain the product distribution of CO2 reduction of Fe–N–C catalysts, the electrolysis was conducted at various constant potentials from −0.6 to −1.1 V vs. RHE for 40 min. The electrolytic cell is purged with CO2 constantly and vented directly into the gas sampling loop of a gas chromatograph to examine the composition of gaseous products. Liquid products were quantified by high-performance liquid chromatography analysis after the electrolysis was finished. It is well established that H2 evolution is a competing reaction with CO2 reduction in CO2-saturated electrolytes, and therefore the production of H2 was also measured during electrolysis. All the data were obtained three times and averaged. No liquid products were detected and H2 and CO were the sole conversion products formed. For a more intuitive comparison, the Faraday efficiency of CO (FECO) on the cathode for all of the Fe–N–C catalysts on the different working potentials is clearly shown in Fig. 5b, where the smaller-sized Fe catalysts possess higher FECO. Notably, the FECO of the Fe SAs catalyst exceeds 95% at any applied potential and attained nearly 100% FECO at −0.9 V vs. RHE, while faradaic efficiency for H2 production (FEH2) was suppressed to a minimum value of 0.5%, indicating its superior selectivity and activity for CO2 reduction to CO. For the 7.6 nm Ni NPs, 92% FECO was observed at −0.8 V vs. RHE, only slightly lower than that of the Fe SAs. With further increasing the Fe particle size, the CO2RR performance weakened and allowed the H2 evolution reaction (HER), as evidenced by the 82% FECO produced by the 16.7 nm Fe NPs and 75% FECO produced by the 44.8 nm Fe NPs. These results demonstrate a size-dependent selectivity of iron-based electrocatalysts for electrochemical CO2 reduction (Fig. 5c). The electrochemical performance of the CO2RR on ZIF-8 N-doped carbon substrates is also tested, and the results are presented in Fig. S7.† The current density of pyrolyzed ZIF-8 (Fig. S8†) is found to be sluggish and FEH2 exceeds 80% at all applied potentials, that is, HER dominates in this case. These results confirm that the isolated iron atoms rather than the N-doped carbon structure play an important role in enhancing the CO2RR performance.
To further study the electrochemical performance of Fe–N–C, CO partial current densities (JCO) are calculated over a wide potential range of −0.6 to −1.1 V vs. RHE, and the results are given in Fig. 5d. Significantly, under the same potential, the smaller the size of Fe NPs is, the higher the JCO is, which exactly proves the influence of particle size on CO production. In particular, the JCO of Fe SAs increased rapidly and outpaced that of other Fe NPs. To a certain extent, this trend reflects the intensification of electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) with smaller-sized Fe catalysts, which was corroborated in the subsequent measurement of ECSA. The double layer capacitance (Cdl) was determined according to the scanning rate dependence of cyclic voltammetry (Fig. S9a–d†) by measuring the capacitive current related to it. The ECSA was calculated by Cdl, presented in Fig. S9e,† demonstrating that Fe SAs possessed the largest Cdl (0.1425 mF cm−2). The Cdl values decreased sequentially in the order of 7.6 Fe NPs, 16.7 Fe NPs and 44.8 Fe NPs, which were quantified as 0.1283, 0.1024 and 0.0645 mF cm−2 respectively, in accordance with JCO.
For a deeper study, the turnover frequency (TOF) of CO production was used to evaluate the intrinsic activities of Fe–N–C accordingly. It is expected that the TOF for Fe SAs of CO production is considerably higher than that attained by different-size Fe NPs at any applicated potential (Fig. 5e). Better yet, at −1.1 V vs. RHE, Fe SAs attained the optimal TOF value of 12056 h−1, which was approximately 7, 44 and 80 times of 7.6, 16.7 and 44.8 Fe NPs correspondingly (Table S2†). Obviously, with increasing the particle size, the TOF value reduces markedly, coinciding well with the results of a series of electrochemical tests mentioned. As far as we know, the TOF result of Fe SAs is comparable with or even outperform those of most metal catalysts (Table S2†), elucidating its remarkable catalytical activities. Then we performed a long-term stability test of the Fe SAs for the CO2RR over 18 h, as shown in Fig. 5f. There is no obvious decay in JCO, while FECO maintains a high value, just slightly lower than 100% over 18 h continuous electrolysis. Overall, Fe SAs prepared in this work are proved to have great superiority and yield classy electro-catalytic activity and selectivity for the conversion of CO2 to CO under practical conditions, probably owing to the increased number of exposed surface active sites induced by highly dispersed single atoms.
To further investigate the changes in the structure of the Fe SAs during the CO2RR and gain insight into the chemical state of the active Fe species, operando X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) and extended XAFS (EXAFS) were employed. In this work, −0.9 V vs. RHE is considered as the optimal potential since FECO and the growth rate of JCO reach the maximum at this potential. However, at −1.0 V vs. RHE, both FECO and the increasing trend of current density decrease, suggesting some changes of Fe SAs around −0.9 V vs. RHE. To explore the causes of this change, operando XAFS measurements in the CO2-saturated 0.5 M KHCO3 catholyte were performed. Fe K-edge XANES spectra (Fig. 6a) and Fourier transformed (FT-EXAFS) spectra (Fig. 6b and c) were obtained for dry samples and for samples that were loaded on hydrophobic carbon paper and immersed in the electrolyte at open circuit potential (OCP) as well as at −0.3 to −0.9 V vs. RHE. The results of Fe K-edge XANES spectra (Fig. 6a) show that there is no obvious shift of absorption edge between the dry powder and the operando sample at −0.3 V vs. RHE and the edge energy could be compared with that of Fe2O3, indicating that Fe sites in Fe SAs remained in the +3 oxidation state during CO2 electroreduction at potentials as negative as −0.3 V vs. RHE, in agreement with the almost identical FT-EXAFS shape shown in Fig. 6b. When the applied potential was shifted to −0.8 V vs. RHE, the edge energy was higher than that of FeO and a bit lower than that for Fe2O3, revealing the ionic Feδ+ (2 < δ < 3) nature of Fe in Fe SAs. With the negative shift of applied potential to −0.9 V vs. RHE, the Fe K-edge shifted to lower energies and was closer to the FeO, suggesting that Fe3+ was reduced to Fe2+. Besides, more stronger peaks emerged in XANES spectra, demonstrating the strengthening of multiple scattering due to the changes of local configuration surrounding Fe sites. In terms of FE-EXAFS analysis, the intense peak attributed to the atomic scattering of Fe–Fe path was located at 2.1 Å at R-space spectra in Fig. 6c, indicating the formation of Fe clusters due to the extremely negative potential. The least-squared EXAFS fitting was carried out to obtain the quantitative coordination environment. The coordination number of the Fe centre with surrounded Fe atoms was 2.8 (Table S3†), indicating that the cluster with a small size was formed.41 At this potential, Fe SAs possess the best selectivity and activity for CO2 reduction to CO. This reduction process illustrates that Fe2+ sites are more conducive to the generation of CO. As mentioned above, at the potential of −0.9v vs. RHE, the electrocatalytic activity of the catalyst reaches the best. In the meanwhile, Fe3+ was reduced to Fe2+ in the Fe SAs, that is, the iron valence state of +2 is the optimum for the CO2RR.

Conclusions
In summary, a well-defined Fe-based single-atom catalyst with highly efficient selectivity and catalytic activity was synthesized via a facile pyrolysis of Fe-doped ZIF-8 and applied in electrocatalytic CO2 reduction to CO. Further, we correlate the size of Fe NPs with their CO2RR performance, ranging from SAs to over 100 nm. The Fe SAs achieve nearly 100% FECO at −0.9 V vs. RHE while the FEH2 of ZIF-8 N-doped carbon substrates exceeds 80% within the measured potential, revealing the importance of the metal center during electroreduction. 7.6 nm, 16.7 nm, 44.8 nm and oversized (>100 nm) Fe NPs are obtained by adjusting the volume of Fe(NO3)3 added, with the corresponding optimal FECO of 92%, 82%, 75% and 27%, respectively. We point out that the size impact on the CO2RR is regular, further proved by the results of JCO and TOF values. Operando XAS confirmed that the active sites in Fe SAs are Fe2+, coordinated to pyrrolic N atoms. The work discussed herein has the potential for guiding future rational design of more non-noble catalysts with cost efficiency.
