    , Accepted 26th June 2017First published on 27th June 2017AbstractHere, we report a facile method to fabricate NiCo2O4 nanoneedles on mesocarbon microbeads (MCMB) and form a unique urchin-like core–shell structure. In this composite, the MCMB not only provided high conductivity to benefit effective electron transfer, but also offered abundant adsorption points to load the NiCo2O4 nanoneedles. The aggregation of the NiCo2O4 nanoneedles was therefore alleviated and each NiCo2O4 grain was unfolded to gain easy access to the electrolyte for efficient ion transfer. When the NiCo2O4@MCMB composite was evaluated as an electrode material for supercapacitors, a synergistic effect was exerted with high specific capacitance (458 F g−1 at 1 A g−1) and large reversibility (116% capacitance retention after 3000 cycles), both of which were of great advantage over individual MCMB and NiCo2O4 nanoneedles. The NiCo2O4@MCMB was also used to construct a symmetric supercapacitor, which showed enlarged voltage profiles and could light the LED device for a few minutes, further confirming its excellent electrochemical performance.
Introduction
With the continuous improvement of the performance of mobile devices, the demand for renewable and environmentally friendly energy sources is also growing, which has stimulated a large number of scientific research efforts.1,2 Natural sources like wind energy, hydropower, and solar energy conditions are generally harsh and intermittent, therefore requiring the development of highly efficient energy storage and conversion devices.3,4 Supercapacitors (SCs) have attracted considerable scientific and technological interest due to their low cost, environmental friendliness,5,6 high power density, excellent reversibility, and long cycle life for the time-dependent power requirement of modern electronics and power systems.7–15 Commercial SC electrode materials are dominated by carbonaceous materials due to their high conductivity, long cycle life and low cost. Based on an electric double layer capacitive (EDLC) behavior, the carbonaceous materials provided a highly reversible charging–discharging process with stable electrode structures and performance. However, their relatively low specific capacitance cannot satisfy the rapidly growing demands of mobile electronic devices and electric vehicles.
More recently, multi-functional transition metal oxides (TMOs) have been extensively studied as potential electrode materials16 due to their high capacitance originating from an electrochemical redox process. Typical TMOs include the single component ones (Co3O4,17 MnO2,18etc.), the binary ones (NiCo2O4,19–21 ZnCo2O4,22 MnCo2O4,23etc.), and the composite structures (SnO2/Co3O4/graphene composites,24 NiCo2O4@Polypyrrole,25etc.). Among these TMO materials, binary nickel cobaltite (NiCo2O4) has aroused much attention due to its high conductivity, high electrochemical activity, abundant availability, low cost and non-toxic nature.26 Until now, NiCo2O4 (NCO) has been successfully fabricated to a variety of morphologies, including urchin-like spheres,27,28 monodisperse mesoporous microspheres,29 nanofilms,30 nanosheets,31 nanoneedles,32 and nanowires.33,34 However, pure NCO was considered unsuitable to be directly used as an electrode material. On one hand, the low conductivity and severe pulverization35 during charging and discharging caused inferior electron transfer and consequently a short cycle life. On the other hand, the aggregation of pure NCO materials induced the low utilization of the electrode materials and consequently a low capacitance. Therefore, various carbonaceous materials (graphene, carbon nanotubes,36etc.) were used as the host materials to load NCO and form carbon-based composites, such as graphene@NCO37,38 and NCO@CNT16 composites. Though improved electrochemical performance was achieved in these composites, the high cost, the complex synthesis procedure and the difficulty in dispersion still hindered their wide application.
In this investigation, we used the highly conductive mesocarbon microbeads (MCMBs) as the substrate material and fabricated a NCO–MCMB composite via a facile solution-based method. Unlike graphene and CNTs which usually involved high cost and complex synthesis procedures, MCMB is a kind of low-cost, easily fabricated and commercially obtained carbon material, which can be extracted from low-cost bitumen. When used as a substrate material for supercapacitors, MCMBs also possessed several advantages compared with graphene and CNTs, including: (i) remarkably alleviated agglomeration due to its microscale dimension, (ii) easy dispersion in solution to achieve a homogeneous composite, and (iii) robust solid structure to retain a highly stable microstructure during cycling. In addition, the spherical and open structure of MCMBs provides a large number of adsorption sites, which make it favorable as a host material. NiCo2O4 nanoneedles were synthesized in the presence of the well-dispersed MCMB, forming an urchin-like core–shell structure. In this structure, the NCO nanoneedles were fully unfolded without agglomeration, which allowed the effective utilization of the NCO grains. The high conductivity and the robust structure of the MCMB cores also rendered the composite with effective electron transfer and high structure stability during electrochemical reactions. Based on these features, the NCO–MCMB composite electrode delivered excellent electrochemical performance with high capacitance and excellent cycling stability. The NCO–MCMB electrode was also used to construct symmetric (SSC) and asymmetric (ASC) supercapacitors, further confirming the advantage of the composite.
Experimental
Material preparation
All the reagents were of analytical grade and directly used after purchase without further purification. 80.16 mg MCMB (prepared from coal tar pitch) was dispersed in deionized water followed by ultrasonication for 30 min to obtain a MCMB suspension (2.3 mg mL−1). NiCo2O4 nanoneedles were synthesized on the surface of the MCMB via a simple one-pot hydrothermal process with a NiCo2O4 mass loading of 75% based on the total mass of NCO–MCMB. 1 mmol of Ni(NO3)2·6H2O and 2 mmol of Co(NO3)2·6H2O were dissolved into the MCMB suspension, followed by the addition of 12 mmol of urea, and the mixture was stirred for 20 min at room temperature to form a clear dark pink solution. Then, the mixture was transferred into a 50 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and maintained at 95 °C for 8 h. After being cooled down to room temperature, the product was taken out and washed with deionized water and ethanol several times. After that, the sample was dried at 80 °C for 24 h. Finally, the as-prepared sample was annealed at 300 °C in air for 1.5 h. For comparison, pure NiCo2O4 particles (labeled as NCO) were also prepared by a similar procedure without MCMB.
Materials analysis
The crystalline structure of the products was identified by X-ray diffraction (XRD) using a Rigaku-D/max 2500 V X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å), with the operation voltage and the current maintained at 40 kV and 40 mA, ranging from 10° to 70° at room temperature. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were obtained using a JEM 2100 F high resolution transmission electron microscope operating at 200 kV. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image observations were carried out on a Sirion 200 scanning electron microscope. Raman spectra were characterized by an inVia Reflex Microscopes Raman Spectrometer at 514 nm. Nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms at 77 K were determined using a Micromeritics Autosorb-iQ2-C. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed on the Kratos-Axis spectrometer with monochromatic Al Kα (1486.71 eV) radiation (15 kV and 10 mA) and a hemispherical electron energy analyzer. Fourier transform infrared spectra (FTIR) were measured with a PerkinElmer Spectrum 100.
Electrochemical measurements
Electrochemical measurements were carried out using an electrochemical workstation (CHI 760e, CH Instruments Inc., Shanghai, China) with a three-electrode configuration in a 3 M KOH aqueous solution. The counter and reference electrodes were Pt foil and Ag/AgCl, respectively. The working electrodes were prepared by mixing the samples, acetylene black, and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) at a weight ratio of 80:10:10 in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) forming a slurry which was uniformly pasted onto the Ni form and dried in a vacuum oven at 120 °C for 12 h to remove the solvent. The values of specific capacitance (F g−1) and current rate (A g−1) were calculated based on the total mass of the active materials. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were performed at a scanning rate of 2 to 100 mV s−1 from 0 to 0.5 V at room temperature. Galvanostatic charging–discharging measurements were carried out from 0 to 0.48 V at a current density of 1 to 10 A g−1. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurement was performed by applying an alternate current (AC) voltage with 5 mV amplitude in a frequency range from 0.01 Hz to 100 kHz.
The SSC device was constructed using the NCO–MCMB composite as both electrodes while the ASC device was constructed using commercially obtained active carbon as the negative electrode and the NCO–MCMB composite as the positive electrode. Both the SSC and ASC devices were assembled in a CR2016-type coin cell using a 3 M KOH solution as the electrolyte, and one piece of cellulose paper as the separator. The mass of the ASC electrode materials was balanced according to the equation: m−/m+ = (C+ × ΔV+)/(C− × ΔV−),39 where m is the mass of electrode, C is the specific capacitance, ΔV is the potential range for the charging–discharging process, and the subscripts “+” and “−” are the positive and negative charge carriers.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1 presents the mechanism of the formation of the NCO–MCMB composites. Co2+ and Ni2+ were electrostatically attracted to the surface of MCMB, which possessed a zeta potential of −26.8 mV (Fig. S1†). During the hydrothermal treatment, the intermediate phase, i.e., nickel–cobalt hydroxide (NiCo2(OH)6),40 crystallized along the radius direction of the MCMB into well dispersed nanoneedles surrounding the MCMB cores. Further calcination allowed the transformation from the intermediate phase into the NCO nanoneedles, with a color change from rose pink to black.

The growth process of the NCO–MCMB composite was further confirmed by their SEM images shown in Fig. 2. Pristine MCMB after calcination presented an ideal spherical morphology with an average diameter of around 3.56 μm (Fig. 2a), and pure NCO synthesized in the absence of MCMB presented as flower-shaped microspheres consisting of nanoneedles (Fig. 2b).41 The introduction of MCMB provided abundant adsorption points to support the NCO precursors, which tended to crystallize surrounding the MCMB cores (Fig. 2c). The morphology of the precursor (Fig. 2c) was well preserved after calcination (Fig. 2d), forming an urchin-like NCO–MCMB core–shell structure with a slightly larger size of 4.33 μm (Fig. 2d). The EDS elemental maps of one NCO–MCMB sphere (Fig. 3e–f) showed that elemental C, Co, Ni, O were well dispersed in the sphere, which gave further evidence for the uniform growth of NiCo2O4 nanoneedles on MCMBs.

The urchin-like NCO–MCMB core–shell structures were further investigated using their TEM images (Fig. 3a), in which the NCO nanoneedles were found to be well unfolded surrounding the MCMB core. It should be mentioned that the NCO–MCMB composite was ultrasonicated for several minutes for the morphology characterization, and during this process the nanoneedles did not break and the MCMB–NCO core–shell structure was well preserved (Fig. 2d and 3a), indicating a strong adhesion between the NCO nanoneedles and the MCMB core. The high-magnification image in Fig. 3b shows a porous structure of the NCO needles consisting of interconnected NCO grains. The formation of the highly porous structure is attributed to the gas release during the decomposition of Co/Ni precursors40 and was expected to provide abundant paths for the electrolyte infiltration. The clearly resolved lattice fringes in the HRTEM image (Fig. 3c) presented a lattice distance of 0.47 nm, which was in good accordance with the (111) plane of spinel structured NiCo2O4. The SAED pattern in Fig. 3d further confirms the polycrystalline nature of the NCO nanoneedles.
The XRD patterns of pristine MCMB, pure NCO and the NCO–MCMB composites are shown in Fig. 4a. Remarkable diffraction peaks of NCO were found in the NCO–MCMB composite, which agreed well with the standard peaks of spinel-structured NCO (PDF #20-0781). In Fig. 4b, the Raman spectra of both MCMB and the NCO–MCMB composite included the G band (about 1590 cm−1) and the D band (about 1350 cm−1), which are respectively assigned to the in-plane bond-stretching motion of the pairs of C sp2 atoms (the E2g phonons) and the breathing modes of rings or K-point phonons of the A1g symmetry. The peaks of the NCO–MCMB at 187, 477, 523, and 671 cm−1 corresponded to the F2g, Eg, F2g, and A1g models of NiCo2O4, respectively.

The NCO–MCMB composites presented a Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) specific surface area of 105.5 m2 g−1. The N2 adsorption–desorption isotherm of the NCO–MCMB composites (Fig. 4c) can be sorted into type IV with a distinct hysteresis loop in the relative pressure range of 0.5 to 1.0, indicating a typical mesoporous microstructure. The pore size distribution curve (the inset of Fig. 4c) indicated that the pores in NCO–MCMB had a narrow distribution centered at 5.5 nm, which corresponded to the pores between the grains in the NCO nanoneedles (Fig. 3b). The mesoporosity in the NCO–MCMB composite was considered favorable for the efficient penetration of the electrolyte into active materials. Two distinguished bands (550 cm−1 and 648 cm−1) were present in the FTIR spectra of the NCO–MCMB composite (Fig. 4d), corresponding to the metallic vibration frequencies of Ni–O and Co–O at the octahedral and tetrahedral spaces, respectively. The peaks at 1380 and 3435 cm−1 were distinguished as the vibrations of COO− and bonded hydroxyl group.42 The existence of the hydroxyl and carboxyl groups was responsible for the negative zeta potential of MCMB, which established a strong electrostatic attraction toward Ni and Co cations to form integrated NCO–MCMB compositing structures (Fig. 1).
The elemental composition and chemical bonding states of NCO–MCMB were determined by XPS (Fig. 5a). The C 1s spectra (Fig. 5b) similarly presented four peaks corresponding to the carbon bonds in C–C, C–O, CC, and OC–O respectively. The Co 2p spectra (Fig. 5c) showed similar doublets corresponding to Co2+ at 779.4/794.6 eV, and Co3+ at 780.9/795.9 eV, with two flat satellites at 785.8 and 803 eV. The deconvoluted Ni 2p spectra (Fig. 5d) presented two spin–orbit doublets for Ni2+ at 854 and 871.6 eV and Ni3+ at 855.5 and 873 eV, each accompanied by the shake-up satellites at 861.4 and 879.5 eV, respectively. This observation verifies the formation of NCO in both composites and pure NCO samples.

The electrochemical capacitive performance of pristine MCMB, pure NCO and the NCO–MCMB composite was evaluated with a three-electrode configuration. The CV curves were tested at the scan rate of 10 mV s−1. No clear capacitive behavior was observed in the pristine MCMB owing to its large diameter and solid sphere structure. Compared to pure NCO, a larger integrated area of the CV curves was exhibited for the NCO–MCMB electrode (Fig. 6a), suggesting a greatly enhanced specific capacitance in the composite. The advantage of the NCO–MCMB composite was also confirmed by the discharging curves at 1A g−1 as shown in Fig. 6b, in which larger discharging time and stable plateaus were exhibited by the NCO–MCMB composite. A specific capacitance of 458 F g−1 was achieved in the NCO–MCMB composite, which was remarkably higher than the 234 F g−1 exhibited in pure NCO. Moreover, smaller intercept, smaller radius and larger slope were observed in the EIS spectra of the NCO–MCMB electrode (Fig. 6c), which demonstrated improved conductivity, facilitated electrolyte infiltration and efficient ion diffusion43 in the MCMB supported urchin-like structure. The superior electrochemical performance was ascribed to the greatly enhanced electron transfer along the NCO nanoneedles and within the MCMB, as well as the improved contact between the well-unfolded NCO nanoneedles and the OH− in the electrolyte (Fig. 6d).

The CV curves of the NCO–MCMB electrode were evaluated at elevated scanning rates. The peaks were located at around 0.23 and 0.35 V when the scan rate was 2 mV s−1. With the 50-fold increase in the sweep rate from 2 to 100 mV s−1, the position of the anodic peak shifts slightly from 0.35 to 0.46 V (Fig. 7a), indicating the excellent high-rate reversibility of the electrode.44 The discharging profiles (Fig. 7b) presented voltage plateaus at around 0.25 to 0.15 V, which is consistent with those reported previously.45,46 The specific capacitance values of the NCO–MCMB composite were calculated as 458, 416, 333, and 250 F g−1 at 1, 2, 5 and 10 A g−1, respectively. About 54.6% of the specific capacitance was retained when the current density increased from 1 to 10 A g−1. Excellent rate performance was also achieved in the NCO–MCMB composite. As shown in Fig. 7c, when the NCO–MCMB electrode was charged and discharged at a progressively increased current density, high specific capacitances of 423, 320, 258 and 216 F g−1 were obtained at 1, 2, 5 and 10 A g−1, respectively. A high capacitance of 416 F g−1 could be retained without a noticeable decrease even when the current rate was recovered to 1 A g−1, demonstrating its high reversibility. The long-term stability of the electrodes was examined at 3 A g−1 (Fig. 7d), at which the electrode experienced three typical charging–discharging processes including: (i) activation in the initial 1500 cycles attributed to the gradual penetration and wetting of the active materials by the electrolyte, (ii) mild capacitance degradation in the 1500–2700 cycles probably due to the partial loss of strong bonds between some loose NCO nanoneedles and the MCMB cores, and (iii) the final 300 cycles with stable capacitance indicating the reversible electrochemical process in the electrode. It should be noted that even in the last 10 cycles, symmetric charging–discharging curves were exhibited in the electrode (the inset of Fig. 7d) and a final capacitance as high as 116% of the initial one was exhibited, demonstrating high electrochemical stability and excellent cyclic reversibility.

To further evaluate the electrodes in real applications, a symmetric (SSC) device was constructed with the NCO–MCMB composite as both electrodes (Fig. 8a). According to the CV curves of the SSC device in Fig. 8b, the operating voltage of the device was extended to 1 V. As the scanning rate was increased, the CV curves remained nearly symmetric, implying an excellent capacitive characteristic. As the SSC device was charged and discharged at the current densities from 1 to 10 A g−1, the discharging curves remained almost symmetrical to the charging curves (Fig. 8c), reflecting excellent capacitive behavior. The specific capacitances of the symmetric device at 1, 2, 5, and 10 A g−1 were 120, 102, 75 and 60 F g−1, respectively. Two SSC devices were further connected in series to output proper voltage and power a light-emitting diode (LED). As shown in Fig. 8d, after charging for 20 s, the LEDs were lighted for as long as 15 minutes, providing experimental evidence for the excellent performance of the devices. In addition, superior long-term stability was also obtained for the SSC device, which exhibited a final capacitance as high as 106% of the initial one in 3000 cycles at 1 A g−1 (Fig. S2†). An ASC device was also constructed with the NCO–MCMB composite as the positive electrode, and the commercial active carbon as the negative electrode. Remarkable redox peaks were observed in the CV curves of the ASC device (Fig. S3a†), which originated from the pseudocapacitive behavior of the NCO–MCMB electrode. Compared to the SSC device, a relatively short discharging time was obtained for the ASC device, resulting in smaller specific capacitances of 44.44, 43.33, 38.9, and 38.9 F g−1 at 1, 2, 5, and 10 A g−1, respectively (Fig. S3b†). The lower capacitance in the ASC device was understandable considering the smaller capacitance of the negative electrodes, i.e., active carbon. The total capacitance of two-electrode SCs (CT) was generally calculated as: 1/CT = 1/Cp + 1/Cn, where Cp and Cn were the capacitances of the positive and negative electrodes, respectively.47 As shown in Fig. S4,† the active carbon electrode could only deliver a capacitance of 70 F g−1, which was much lower than that of the NCO–MCMB electrode and therefore it greatly limited the total capacitance of the ASC device.

The advantage of the NCO–MCMB composite was ascribed to its unique microstructures, including: (1) the MCMB rendered the composite with excellent electrical conductivity, which benefits fast and efficient electron transfer. (2) The urchin-like structure of NCO on the MCMB core allowed each NCO nanoneedle to be fully unfolded and participate in the electrochemical reactions, which effectively enhanced the utilization of the NCO grains. (3) The strong bond between the MCMB shell and the NCO core built a robust composite structure, which remained highly stable during the electrochemical process and further induced high reversibility of the composite electrode. (4) The highly porous structure of the composite provided abundant channels for ion exchange and therefore facilitated easy electrolyte infiltration, efficient electrochemical reaction and rapid ion exchange. All these reasons indicate a synergistic effect between individual components in the composites.
Conclusions
In summary, we demonstrated significantly enhanced electrochemical performance of NCO via the introduction of MCMB as the substrate and the formation of a unique urchin-like core–shell structure. The rational design was realized by a facile and high-efficiency hydrothermal method, and resulted in highly reversible capacitance, excellent cycling stability and good rate capability. A symmetric supercapacitor was also fabricated based on the NCO–MCMB composite. The remarkable performance of the composite was directly ascribed to the synergic effect between the individual components in the composite. The scalable fabrication procedure introduced in this article can also be extended to other active materials for future supercapacitor electrodes.
