    , Accepted 23rd April 2021First published on 24th April 2021AbstractRedox flow batteries (RFBs) are regarded as one of the most promising energy storage devices for the efficient utilization of intermittent renewable energy, such as solar and wind energies, yet the development of RFBs has been hindered by the narrow electrochemical window of aqueous electrolytes. Developing nonaqueous RFBs using organic electrolytes is an attractive way to address the abovementioned issue. Here, we report a cyanocarbon-based, two-electron-active anolyte compound, tetracyanoethylene (TCNE), with high solubility (2.0 M in acetonitrile), remarkable electrochemical stability and redox reversibility, and fast electrokinetics. Density-functional theory (DFT) calculations for different oxidation states of TCNE were performed to evaluate molecular orbitals during redox processes. Inexpensive and environmentally friendly sodium perchlorate is used as the supporting electrolyte as a replacement for the more commonly used and expensive tetraalkylammonium salts. When paired with a phenazine derivative (PEG1-PTZ) catholyte, the all-organic nonaqueous RFB exhibits a cell voltage of 1.45 V, a capacity retention of 73.3% over 200 cycles (99.9% per cycle), and a maximum power density of 72.5 mW cm−2. This study introduces a new type of redox-active organic compound with multi-electron activity, high electrochemical reversibility, and desirable electrokinetics, enriching the family of organic compounds for nonaqueous RFBs.
Introduction
Increasing energy and environmental concerns have promoted the exploration of renewable energy sources, such as wind, solar, tidal, and geothermal energies.1–6 In addition to energy capture, the conversion and storage of renewable energy remain one of the most active and challenging research topics.7–11 Energy storage devices, including supercapacitors, metal ion batteries, metal–air batteries, and redox flow batteries (RFBs), have been successfully applied in various fields because of their unique advantages.12–17 Compared to the configuration of a conventional battery, where redox-active materials are confined in solid-state electrodes, the solution-based redox electrolytes of RFBs are stored in external reservoirs, enabling decoupling of energy and power, as well as superior scalability.18–21 Both the negative and positive electrolytes, termed the anolyte and catholyte, respectively, circulate through the battery compartments, where the electrochemical reactions occur for energy storage and release.22,23
Vanadium-based flow batteries (VRBs), as the most successful commercial RFBs, possess the advantages of excellent safety and long cycling lifetime; however, the shortcomings of in-operation VRBs due to the use of highly toxic active materials, highly corrosive acidic electrolytes, and expensive vanadium salts hinder the further development of VRBs.24,25 Consequently, remarkable attention has been paid to the development of water-soluble, redox-active organic materials due to their structural diversity, low cost, and environmental friendliness.20,26–29 Even though great progress has been made, the energy density of both VFBs and organic aqueous RFBs has been restricted by the narrow electrochemical window of typical aqueous solutions (<1.5 V).30,31
Nonaqueous organic RFBs (NORFBs) using organic solvents substantially extend the electrochemical window up to 4 V,32 thus possessing the potential to overcome the drawbacks of aqueous RFBs.33–35 NORFBs require high solubility of redox-active organic materials in organic solvents to achieve high energy density. Several organic redox-active materials have been developed for NORFBs, including ferrocene,36 quinone,37 phenazine,38 organometallic complexes,39,40 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl,41 viologen,42 and their derivatives. Despite the progress made, the current NORFBs still suffer from the lack of (1) suitable membranes to block the permeation of redox materials to the counter compartment while permitting the transportation of supporting ions for charge balance during charge/discharge43 and (2) the redox materials with the combined properties of multielectron activity, facile synthesis, high stability, and high solubility.33,42,44–48 This work is directly relevant to the latter concern, detailing the investigation of a new family of organic materials with the required features for NORFBs.
Cyanocarbons are a group of organic compounds bearing several cyanide units (–CN) with special chemical and electrochemical properties.49 Due to a large number of cyanide groups, cyanocarbons are typically highly conjugated with remarkable redox reversibility.50 It is also found that the complexation of tetracyanoethylene (TCNE) with organometallic compounds results in low reduction potentials.51 Another counterpart, tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ), can be reduced to give a blue-colored radical anion and exhibits excellent redox properties.52 However, despite a small number of applications of TCNQ as an organic electrode in lithium-ion batteries,53,54 cyanocarbons are rarely used in RFBs.
Here we report the thorough electrochemical investigation of commercially available TCNE as a two-electron-active anolyte for NORFBs. The electrochemical properties are studied by a combination of voltammetry, computation, and battery tests. The comparable redox behaviors of TCNE in both inorganic (sodium perchlorate, NaClO4) and organic (tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate, TBAPF6) supporting electrolytes suggest that the inexpensive NaClO4 can be used as a replacement for the more expensive TBAPF6 in NORFBs. In addition, density-functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to evaluate the electronic properties and molecular orbitals of different oxidation states of TCNE during redox processes. When paired with the widely used phenothiazine catholyte, the TCNE-based battery shows a voltage of 1.49 V with two-electron activity. At a lower TCNE concentration of 0.2 M, this battery presents a capacity retention of over 99.9% per cycle and a power density of 72.5 mW cm−2. A higher TCNE electrolyte concentration of 0.5 M (=1.0 M electron concentration) in the TCNE-based battery shows negligible capacity fade over 50 cycles, demonstrating great potential of TCNE for use in NORFBs.
Results and discussion
Physical properties
The energy density of a RFB is highly dependent on the concentration of the redox-active materials. The solubility of TCNE can reach up to 2.0 M in acetonitrile (MeCN, Fig. S1,† see the Experimental section for testing details), corresponding to a capacity of 107.2 A h L−1 based on two-electron activity, which is higher than that of most of the reported state-of-the-art NORFB materials.43,55,56 Furthermore, TCNE has a superior intrinsic capacity, which is defined as the amount of charge stored in a specific mass (per gram) of material.48,57 With the same number of electrons for half–cell reactions, the smaller the molecular weight, the higher the capability of molecules for electron storage.48 Sanford and co-workers proposed a weight-to-charge ratio of less than 150 g per (mol e−) for anolyte and catholyte materials.58 The low molecular weight of TCNE (128 g mol−1) results in an intrinsic equivalent weight of 64 g per (mol e−), which is much smaller than the suggested value, making TCNE an attractive anolyte candidate.
Electrochemical properties
The electrochemical study started with the scrutiny of supporting electrolytes. Tetraalkylammonium hexafluorophosphate or tetrafluoroborate has been widely used as a supporting salt in NORFBs, and the more inexpensive and environmentally friendly inorganic salts are rarely reported for NORFBs due to the limited solubility and resultant instability of redox-active organic materials.44 Here, we tested the electrochemical behavior of TCNE using both NaClO4 and TBAPF6 in MeCN. The solubility of NaClO4 can reach as high as 2.25 M in MeCN, which is sufficient for application in NORFBs. The study of the redox properties of the TCNE material starts with CV measurements using 5.0 mM TCNE in 0.1 M NaClO4 or TBAPF6 in MeCN. Both NaClO4 and TBAPF6 showed almost identical redox features (Fig. S2†), and thus NaClO4 was used for the subsequent electrokinetics and battery studies. Two redox peaks were observed at −0.05 V and −1.08 V vs. Ag/Ag+ (Fig. 1A). The widely studied phenazine is selected as the catholyte in this work (Fig. 1B). The mixed electrolytes (black trace in Fig. 1A) showed the same features as the sum of those from the individual electrolytes (red and blue traces in Fig. 1A), suggesting negligible chemical interaction between TCNE and PEG1-PTZ. We have successfully demonstrated the use of PEGylated phenazine compounds (PEG12-PTZ and PEG3-PTZ) with 12 and 3 poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) units, respectively, in our previous studies.59–61 Here, we further reduced the length of the PEG chain to 1 (thus termed PEG1-PTZ) to decrease the weight-to-charge ratio, while still maintaining the high solubility (up to 4.0 M neat concentration). Paired with PEG1-PTZ with a redox potential of 0.41 V vs. Ag/Ag+, the TCNE-based battery possesses a voltage of 1.49 V.

DFT calculations for TCNE in neutral, one-, and two-electron reduced states were performed in order to evaluate orbital energy levels during the redox processes (Fig. 1C).62 The results show that the electron densities of the LUMO of TCNE and the HOMO of both TCNE− and TCNE2− orbitals are almost identical and mapped through the compound symmetrically. The calculation result also indicates that the energy band gap (ΔE) for TCNE− is smaller than those of TCNE and TCNE2−. The electron affinity of the first and second reduction events was calculated in the gas phase and MeCN to check the solvent effect. In the gas phase, an energy of −3.44 and 1.87 eV was required for the first and second electron addition, while these values are −4.90 and −3.39 eV in MeCN. These results show that (1) the binding of the second electron to TCNE− is thermodynamically disfavored compared to the first electron, and (2) the solvent facilitates the second electron binding.62 Additionally, the electrostatic potential map of the reduced TCNE species (Fig.S3†) represents the electron density maps through the molecule, especially nitrogen atoms, which is responsible for the electron affinity. In addition, the high symmetry of electrostatic potential maps of TCNE− and TCNE2− indicates that all four cyano groups of TCNE take part in the redox processes.
Electrokinetics
The electrokinetics of TCNE were studied by CV measurements under the same conditions as above with different scan rates (5–2000 mV s−1). A linear trend of current density as a function of the square root of the scan rate indicates diffusion-controlled processes on the electrode surface (Fig. S4†). According to the Randles–Sevcik equation (eqn (S1)†),63–65 the diffusion coefficients for the first and second reduction events were calculated to be 5.67 × 10−6 and 9.23 × 10−6 cm2 s−1, respectively (see the Experimental section for more detailed calculations). To further characterize the electrochemical kinetics of both reduction events, linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) was performed using 1.0 mM active materials, TCNE and PEG1-PTZ, in 0.1 M NaClO4/MeCN electrolytes with a rotating disk electrode (RDE).66 The LSV curves of TCNE with varied rotation rates are presented in Fig. 2A, showing two well-defined plateaus corresponding to the two reduction processes (TCNE/TCNE− and TCNE−/TCNE2−). Using the Lévich equation (eqn (S2)†),67,68 the coefficients for the first and second reduction peaks were determined to be 1.83 × 10−6 and 4.74 × 10−6 cm2 s−1, respectively (Fig. 2B). Two different methods gave the same order of magnitude of diffusion coefficients as reported values,69,70 indicating that the diffusion of TCNE on the electrode surface does not limit the redox reaction. Furthermore, the limiting current was obtained from the x-intercept of the Tafel plot (Fig. 2C and D and S5†). According to the Butler–Volmer equation (eqn (S3)†),18,71 kinetic rate constants of 8.38 × 10−3 and 1.81 × 10−3 cm s−1 were obtained for the first and second reduction processes, respectively (see the Experimental section for more detailed calculations). The catholyte material PEG1-PTZ was subjected to the same test, and a satisfactory diffusion coefficient (1.75 × 10−5 cm2 s−1) and reaction rate constant (8.02 × 10−3 cm s−1) were obtained through similar methods (Fig. S6†). The high kinetic parameters validate that TCNE and PEG1-PTZ have satisfactory diffusion properties and electron transfer capabilities in the NaClO4 electrolyte for the subsequent battery studies.72

Static battery test
Since the operation lifetime is an important parameter for the application of RFBs, the TCNE/PEG1-PTZ static battery was initially tested using mixed electrolytes for both anolyte and catholyte sides to gain insights into the intrinsic properties of TCNE using a closed, non-flowing battery setup built in-house (Fig. S7†). A 0.2 M TCNE/PEG1-PTZ static battery was adopted to investigate the long-term cycling performance of TCNE.73 After 300 cycles, the battery showed a capacity of 15.1 mA h, retaining 91.5% of the initial capacity (99.97% per cycle) and 70.4% of the theoretical capacity (Fig. S8A and B†). In addition to capacity retention, CV measurement of the pre- and post-cycling electrolytes is also an effective way to evaluate battery stability. As shown in Fig. S8C,† almost identical CV traces were observed, suggesting high stability and redox reversibility of TCNE in the static battery. Furthermore, the negligible change in impedance before and after cycling also indicates the stability of the battery (Fig. S8D†).
With promising preliminary results for the 0.2 M static battery, we continued with the same measurement at a higher TCNE concentration of 0.5 M, corresponding to 1 M electron concentration. The 0.5 M TCNE/PEG1-PTZ battery showed a capacity retention of 84.5% over 200 cycles (from 28.4 to 24.1 mA h), with an average capacity fade rate of 0.078% per cycle (Fig. 3A and B). Comparable with the 0.2 M static battery, both CV and impedance tests revealed that the increased TCNE concentration did not sacrifice the cyclability of the TCNE battery (Fig. 3C and S9†). Even though the static and mixed-electrolyte setups are not suitable for practical applications, the excellent cyclability and low capacity fade rate illustrate the stability of TCNE in electrochemical cells, as further demonstrated in the following flow-mode studies.

RFB test
The TCNE/PEG1-PTZ batteries were also tested in a flow mode at different TCNE concentrations. A lower concentration of 0.2 M of TCNE was first studied (see the Experimental section for details) to explore the battery performance, including charge rate, polarization, energy density, and cyclability. An excess of PEG1-PTZ catholyte was used to allow complete electrochemical conversion of TCNE. The flow cell presented a discharge capacity of 41.3 mA h, corresponding to 54.6% of the theoretical capacity (Fig. 4A and B). The battery also exhibited an average capacity retention of 73.3% for 200 cycles (99.9% per cycle) at a current density of 60 mA cm−2 with an average coulombic efficiency of 99.2% (Fig. 4A). The CV of the post-cycling electrolyte showed different features at the second reduction peak (Fig. S10†), which may be due to the excessive binding force of Na+ and reduced TCNE species.44 Meanwhile, the increased impedance (from 3.4 Ω cm2 to 7.5 Ω cm2) resulted in an increase of battery polarization, which is presumably the major cause of capacity degradation (Fig. 4B and C).

(E) Polarizations of the battery at 60%, 80%, and 100% state-of-charge. 
The rate performance of the battery reflects its electrochemical stability under different charge/discharge conditions. The battery was galvanostatically charged/discharged at current densities from 60 to 100 mA cm−2 (Fig. 4D). At a low current density of 60 mA cm−2, the battery delivered a discharge capacity of 37.8 mA h. The discharge capacities at the current densities of 80 and 100 mA cm−2 were 33.6 and 30.7 mA h, respectively (Fig. 4D). The comparison of the area specific resistance (ASR) of the high frequency region, which primarily reflects the resistance of the membrane,74 to the polarization ASR of the entire battery obtained from LSV at different SOCs shows that the membrane contributes ∼70% of the overall resistance (Fig. S11 and S12†). In addition, the polarization curve of the power density and current density (Fig. 4E) exhibits a current power density of 72.5 mW cm−2 at 100% SOC, which is comparable with that of most of the state-of-the-art NORFBs.72,75
The 0.5 M TCNE flow cell was also successfully demonstrated with a satisfactory capacity retention; no obvious capacity fade was observed after 50 cycles (initial capacity: 60.2 mA h, 50th cycle capacity: 62.1 mA h, and maximum capacity: 84.1 mA h, corresponding to 23.3 Ah/L) (Fig. 5). However, the change of electrolyte volume during the charge and discharge process due to osmosis and increased electrolyte viscosity also intensified. This leads to greater impedance changes and a larger difference in the CV curves before and after cycling (Fig. 5B and C). Further improvement of flow cell performance, especially in the high-concentration regime requires insights into the origin of electrolyte viscosity and optimization of the cell design to facilitate mass and charge transfer. Nevertheless, because of the combined features of two-electron activity and high solubility (0.5 M), the theoretical volume energy density of this system can reach as high as 26.6 W h L−1 (eqn (S4)†), exceeding those of most other flow batteries,18,72 demonstrating the great potential of TCNE as a redox-active material for NORFBs.

Conclusions
We report a new type of two-electron-active organic compound, TCNE, as an anolyte for NORFBs using inexpensive NaClO4 as the supporting electrolyte. The TCNE/PEG1-PTZ battery possesses a voltage of 1.49 V and presents excellent capacity retention at different TCNE concentrations under both static and flow conditions. Molecular orbital calculations show lower energy gaps and higher electron affinity of reduced TCNE. The cell delivers a power density of 72.5 mW cm−2 and shows stable cyclability with an average capacity retention of 99.9% per cycle. Due to the two-electron activity and high solubility of TCNE, the 0.5 M TCNE battery can exhibit a volumetric energy density of 26 W h L−1. The rapid redox kinetics and high stability make TCNE a promising alternative organic compound towards high-performance NORFBs for large-scale energy storage.
