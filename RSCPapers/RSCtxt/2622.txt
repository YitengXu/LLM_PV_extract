    , Accepted 8th March 2017First published on 8th March 2017AbstractWe present a device which is able to separate gases from a gas stream using supercapacitive energy. When a small bias (1 V) is applied to the electrodes and a CO2/N2 mixture is fed through the device, carbon dioxide is selectively adsorbed to those electrodes, and N2 leaves the device in a purified form. When the module is discharged, the CO2 is quantitatively desorbed, and leaves the device in a concentrated form. A single module is able to concentrate CO2 from 15% in the feed gas to 46% in the effluent gas. The energy invested to charge the electrodes can be largely recovered upon discharge. At a charging current of 1 mA an energy recovery rate of 78% can be reached and the associated total energy consumption of the device is 57 kJ mol−1.
The application of new physical phenomena in functional devices is of paramount importance for the technological advancement of society. For example, the discovery of the photovoltaic effect has led to solar cells which are now an important energy source,1 microbalances have emerged from the piezoelectric effect,2 and the first demonstration of the laser effect has led to numerous devices ranging from laser pointers to nuclear fusion reactors.3 Recently, we discovered a new phenomenon, the Supercapacitive Swing Adsorption (SSA) Effect.4 The effect was observed when two block-shaped carbon electrodes were capacitively charged to small voltages between 0.3 V and 1.2 V DC inside a closed gas adsorption cell containing an N2/CO2 gas mixture and a 1 M NaCl electrolyte (Fig. S1, ESI†). It was found that upon charging the electrodes, the pressure in the cell changed. Upon discharge of the electrodes it returned to its original value, indicating reversible gas adsorption. It was further observed that the gas adsorption was highly selective for CO2 and increased with the applied voltage.4 However, the charge–discharge and adsorption–desorption kinetics were slow, the cell did not allow to separate gases from a continuous gas stream, and the change in the gas composition was small.
Herein, we present a prototype Supercapacitive Swing Adsorption Module that is able to separate carbon dioxide and nitrogen from a continuous N2/CO2 gas stream, showing fast adsorption/desorption as well as charge/discharge kinetics, and producing highly enriched CO2 in the effluent gas stream.
The module combines the design principles of coin type supercapacitors and fuel cells. A coin type supercapacitor has a sandwich structure in which two porous carbon sheets are separated by an electrically insulating separator which is typically a macroporous polymer sheet (e.g. polypropylene or cellulose), Fig. 1a.5 The two carbon layers are deposited on two metal sheets which act as current collectors. The separator is soaked with the electrolyte which can be an aqueous solution of e.g. sodium chloride or sodium sulfate, or a non-aqueous solution of organic salts, e.g. a solution of NEt4+ BF4− in acetonitrile (Et = ethyl). The sheet-like shape of the electrodes and the separator is chosen because this design enables fast charge and discharge kinetics and a low internal resistance.

We thought that a supercapacitive swing adsorption module design which is based on a coin-type supercapacitor is appealing because of the fast charge–discharge kinetics one would expect. However, the design would need to be modified so that it would be suitable for gas separation. To achieve this, we decided to implement gas flow channels and a gas diffusion layer into the capacitor (Fig. 1c). The concept of gas flow channels and gas diffusion layers is well known from fuel cell technology.6 Similar to a supercapacitor, a fuel cell consists of sheet-shaped carbon electrodes which are separated by a separator that contains an electrolyte (Fig. 1b), e.g. a Nafion membrane. In contrast to a supercapacitor, a fuel cell is an electrochemical device through which there is a permanent gas flow. The gas diffusion layer is typically a carbon cloth which is interfaced between the electrodes and graphite plates which act as current collectors. The graphite plates contain channels along which the gases flow. The function of the gas diffusion layers is to ensure that the gas can diffuse between the graphite plates and the electrodes while maintaining the electrical contact between the electrodes and the current collectors. When implemented into an SSA module, fuel cell-type gas flow channels and diffusion layers should lead to fast adsorption and desorption kinetics, due to the large contact area between the gas and the thin electrodes. The long travel path for the gas mixture through the gas flow channels of the device should lead to effective gas separation. In operation, the gas mixture would flow through the gas flow channels while the capacitor is charged, thereby selectively adsorbing one gas from the gas mixture, and the other gas leaving the apparatus in purified form. Upon discharge of the capacitor, the adsorbed gas would be desorbed and leave the apparatus in concentrated form. Based on these considerations, we constructed a Supercapacitive Swing Adsorption Module using BPL carbon as electrode material and a 1 M NaCl solution as electrolyte. The experimental details with regard to electrode fabrication and the assembly of the module can be found in the ESI.†
To show that the SSA device can be operated in gas flow-through mode we designed an SSA breakthrough experiment. To perform this experiment, the SSA module was placed in between a gas entry and a gas exit valve. This unit was placed in between a mass flow controller and a mass flow meter. After the assembly of the module, the two valves were opened and a 15%:85% CO2:N2 gas mixture, moistened by bubbling the mixture through a 1 M NaCl solution, was flown through the module for 2 h at a flow rate of 0.1 cc min−1. The gas mixture served as a flue gas simulant. Then, the gas entry and exit valves were closed, and the device was let sit overnight to let the CO2 fully dissolve in the electrolyte, and the conventional CO2 adsorption to the electrodes complete. After that, the device was purged quickly for 1 min in an N2 stream at a flow rate of 10 cc min−1. This last step had the purpose to remove all CO2 from the dead volume without removing significant amounts of conventionally adsorbed and dissolved CO2 from the system. The combined steps are important in order to clearly distinguish between CO2 separated by conventional adsorption, and CO2 separated by the SSA effect.
Next, a breakthrough curve without applied bias was measured by flowing a 15%:85% CO2:N2 gas mixture through the device. According to Fig. 2a, the CO2 content reached its original value of 15% after a time of 9 min in the experiment without applied bias. This is the expected time for a gas mixture flowing through a dead volume of 0.9 mL at a flow rate of 0.1 cc min−1. In an analogous SSA experiment with applied bias (1 V), Fig. 2b, carbon dioxide was not detected for 22 min, and the original CO2 content of 15% was measured only after 32 min. Considering that it took the gas 9 min to flow through the void volume, it can be concluded that the actual breakthrough of CO2 occurred between 13 and 23 minutes. The results show that there was CO2 separation due to the SSA effect. In order to see if the CO2 adsorption was reversible, the gas entry and the gas exit valves were closed and the capacitor was discharged. After 30 min, the valves were opened and the desorbed CO2 was purged out of the capacitor using N2. To avoid the desorption of conventionally adsorbed CO2, a fast purge rate of 1 cc min−1 was used, and the effluent gas was analyzed by gas chromatography. As can be seen from Table 1 (column 2), the carbon dioxide concentration in the cell was increased dramatically to 46.61% compared to the initial gas mixture (15%), showing that the adsorption was reversible, and actual gas separation took place. The purging of the CO2 from the SSA module was essentially complete after 2 minutes.

Following this separation cycle, another cycle was performed to investigate multicyclability and reproducibility. The CO2 breakthrough curve is shown in Fig. 2c, which is very similar to that of the first cycle (Fig. 2b). For the first ca. 20 min, no carbon dioxide was detected, and after ca. 30 minutes the SSA effect was saturated. GC measurements of the effluent gas obtained by N2 purging after discharge of the electrodes are shown in Table 1 (column 3). It can be seen from the data that the separation performance of the SSA module is repeatable over more than one cycle. For the 2nd cycle, carbon dioxide was detected 12 min after the gas mixture was flown through the device and reached saturation at 22 min (taking into account the ca. 9 minutes the gas needs to flow through the device due to the dead volume). A breakthrough point is defined as the point in time at which the effluent gas concentration reaches 50% of the influent gas concentration.7,8 According to that, the breakthrough time in our experiment is 18 min. In the desorption half-cycle, the CO2 concentration increased to 45.95%, which means that after the desorption half-cycle, 45.95% of the dead volume was carbon dioxide. This value is very close to the value measured for the first desorption half-cycle (46.61%), demonstrating good cycle-to-cycle repeatability.
In the adsorption half-cycle, the amount of carbon dioxide adsorbed due to the SSA effect can be calculated as 0.1 mL min−1 × 18 min × 15% = 0.27 mL. In the desorption half-cycle, the amount desorbed by SSA effect caused the CO2 concentration to rise from 15% to 46.28% (this is the average of 46.61% and 45.95%), therefore the amount desorbed can be calculated as 0.9 mL × (46.28% − 15%) = 0.281 mL. The two values are in excellent agreement, and the small difference between the adsorbed and desorbed amount is likely due to measurement inaccuracy. This inaccuracy is likely due to the fact that the sampled gas could only be measured every 2 minutes in our GC instrument, therefore the breakthrough time might not be completely accurate. Nonetheless, this data confirms that the adsorbed CO2 can be released completely during the discharge step. During the adsorption half-cycle, the amount of carbon dioxide was n = pV/RT = 0.011 mmol, where R is 62.36 mL mmHg K−1 mmol−1, T is 298 K, p is 760 mmHg and V is 0.27 mL. Since 0.290 g carbon material was used in the working (gas-exposed) electrode, the SSA sorption capacity can be calculated as 0.011 mmol/0.290 g = 38 mmol kg−1. This value is in very good agreement with the adsorption capacity (40 mmol kg−1) measured in our previous SSA experiments in the simple adsorption cell with the carbon monoliths.4 The result shows that the amount of free electrolyte (that is the amount of electrolyte outside of the electrodes) has no significant influence on the sorption capacity. In our experiments with the monolithic electrodes the amount of free electrolyte was large, whereas there was hardly any free electrolyte in the SSA module. The result confirms that the gas adsorption takes place at the electrodes and not in the free electrolyte solution. The latter case is theoretically conceivable due to a difference in CO2 solubility as a consequence of electrolyte desalination during the charging process. In broad terms, the interaction of the CO2 with the electrodes can be described as adsorption which is induced by the changes in the electronic structure of the electrodes upon charging. The adsorption could either happen at the solid-gas interface, the solid–liquid interface, or both. In the first case, CO2 would adsorb to pores that are not infiltrated by the electrolyte. These pores would exist because in an activated carbon there are hydrophilic pores with e.g. carboxylic acid functionalities next to hydrophobic pores with e.g. C–H functionalities. Only hydrophilic pores would be infiltrated by an aqueous solution because only in this case capillary forces are positive, leaving the hydrophobic ones accessible for gas adsorption. Adsorption at the solid–liquid interface could occur because dissolved CO2 molecules would hydrolize to form carbonic acid which would dissociate into H+ and HCO3− ions. These ions would then become adsorbed to the electrodes via electrostatic interactions. This would lead to a depletion of ions in the electrolyte which would cause more gaseous CO2 to dissolve and ionize. Hamelers et al. have recently shown that it is possible to adsorb bicarbonate formed from aqueous CO2 solutions to carbon electrodes.9–11 However, this approach was directed at energy harvesting by utilizing entropies of mixing, and required ion exchange membranes to build potentials between the electrodes. No external voltage was applied to the electrodes to achieve ion adsorption. In addition, it also seems possible that the solubility of molecular CO2 in the double layer(s) is enhanced compared to the bulk electrolyte solution because of the extreme field gradient in the double layers which is in the order of billions of volts per meter. Further, there may be ion-quadruple and Lewis acid–base interactions between the ions in the double layers and the CO2 molecules leading to adsorption of CO2 to the double layer. It is noteworthy that in our previous experiments with the carbon monoliths as electrodes it took ca. 8 hours until the full sorption capacity was reached, because of the slow adsorption kinetics associated with the monolithic electrodes, while in the breakthrough experiments with the newly designed SSA module, the adsorption capacity was reached already within ca. 30 minutes. Compared to the conventional sorption capacity of BPL carbon at a CO2 pressure of 0.15 atm and 298 K (determined by recording ca conventional CO2 isotherm), the sorption capacity due to the SSA effect is smaller, but within the same order of magnitude (240 mmol kg−1vs. 38 mmol kg−1).4
The electrochemical characteristics of the SSA module were determined. The curve obtained from a full cell CV experiment, plotted in Fig. S4 (ESI†), confirms the capacitive behavior of the system. The capacitive behavior of the system was further confirmed in a galvanostatic charge/discharge experiment (full cell configuration). The charging current was 1 mA and the voltage ranged from 0 V to 1 V. The curve is shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†). The capacitance of the system was calculated to be C = It/V = 0.001 A × 5688 s/1 V = 5.68 F. In gas separation technologies the energy consumption is often a major cost driver which can prohibit the practicality of a technology. An example is carbon dioxide capture from flue gas in coal-fired power plants, for which currently no satisfactory technology exists. In order to estimate the energy consumed in an SSA cycle, the energy used to charge and discharge the capacitor was determined by integrating the charge and discharge curves, respectively. For the five cycles, the average energy flown into the device was Echarge = 0.001 A × 2842.27 V s = 2.842 J, the energy recovered upon the discharge cycle was Edischarge = 0.001 A × 2218.72 V s = 2.221 J, therefore the energy efficiency was Edischarge/Echarge = 78%. This energy efficiency was achieved at a current density of 1 mA/0.29 g = 3.5 mA g−1. This is a significant improvement compared to our experiments with the monolithic electrodes, in which we achieved a comparable energy efficiency of 74% only at a current density of 2 mA/3.7 g = 0.54 mA g−1. The net energy consumption of a charge–discharge cycle was 2.842 J − 2.221 J = 0.624 J. Because we previously measured that 0.011 mmol carbon dioxide was adsorbed in a cycle, we can calculate an extrapolated energy consumption of 57 kJ mol−1 or 1.28 GJ per ton CO2. Coal-fired power plants generate approximately 3.6 GJ of energy per ton of CO2.12 Accordingly, the parasitic load associated with an SSA cycle is 35.7%, a value which is on par with amine scrubbing technology.13 However, the actual parasitic load may be higher because a gas turbine generating electricity does not operate at energy efficiencies higher than 60%, and there may be other losses due to the necessary conversions of electrical energy. On the other hand, supercapacitors are known to exhibit charge–discharge energy efficiencies of up to 95%, and thus there is significant optimization potential.14 In addition, there may be other electrolytes and electrode materials that exhibit a better sorption capacity. Compared to other electrical and electrochemical approaches to carbon dioxide separation Supercapacitive Swing Adsorption has the significant advantage that no permanent current flows and that no chemical bonds need to be formed and broken. In Electrical Swing Adsorption (ESA), for example, a permanent current is passed over an electrically conducting porous sorbent to desorb via resistive heating leading to a high energy penalty.15 Various electrochemical redox chemistries have been invented to achieve CO2 separation, for example, electrochemically induced pH swings,16–20 generation of CO2-capturing nucleophiles by electrochemical reduction of organic compounds,21–26 and electrochemically mediated amine regeneration (EMAR), all of which require a permanent current.27,28 The reported redox chemistries suffer from the same problem as thermal amine-scrubbing: inert covalent bonds are formed during the CO2 capture, and thus large amounts of (electrical) energy are required to cleave the bonds and liberate the CO2. SSA does not have this disadvantage because it relies on capacitively induced adsorption which is easily reversible. Most of the capacitive energy used for adsorption can be recovered upon desorption. Redox-active organic molecules are inherently expensive and mostly environmentally unfriendly. Toxic and volatile aprotic solvents are usually required to avoid the decomposition of reactive nucleophiles. EMAR requires expensive copper electrodes with a comparatively limited lifetime, and a toxic, volatile amine solution which is prone to degradation by O2. By contrast, SSA only uses activated carbons and aqueous NaCl solutions which are inherently low cost, non-toxic, and not prone to degradation. A further approach to electrochemical carbon dioxide separation is the molten carbonate CO2 concentrator (MCCC) which is derived from the molten carbonate fuel cell (MCFC).29–32 MCCC does not have the disadvantages of organic redox systems, however it requires very high temperatures of operation, and the availability of hydrogen.
In conclusion, we have developed a Supercapacitive Swing Adsorption module, and demonstrated that the device is able to separate the components of a 15%:85% CO2:N2 feed gas stream. A single module with a foot print of 3 cm × 3 cm is able to enrich the CO2 content from 15% in the feed gas stream to 46% in the effluent gas stream. The greatly enhanced CO2 content in the effluent gas compared to the feed gas suggests that it should be possible to produce nearly pure CO2 by connecting several SSA modules in series. The device exhibits much improved gas adsorption/desorption kinetics due to the large contact area between the electrode and the gas. At this stage of development the energy consumption in a charge–discharge cycle is comparable to that in amine-scrubbing technologies. Besides CO2 capture, also other applications of SSA may be envisioned, such as water carbonization, greenhouse gas fertilization, life support systems, and natural gas purification. Scaling of the device may be achieved by increasing its footprint, and by stacking individual modules similar to fuel cells. The modules may be operated under continuous gas flow when two modules are operated in parallel, one in adsorbing/charged mode, the other in desorbing/discharged mode.
