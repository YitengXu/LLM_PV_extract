    , Accepted 23rd September 2022First published on 23rd September 2022AbstractSearching for an earth-abundant and environment-friendly absorber for thin-film solar cells that provides similar power conversion efficiency to CdTe and Cu(In,Ga)Se2 is of great importance for large-scale applications. Success would change the world's solar energy supply to an even more sustainable material resource. In this paper, we have studied by first-principles calculations the electronic structure and defect properties of the promising absorber Cu3SbS4. Its electronic properties, like direct band gap, high absorption coefficient, and light carrier effective masses, satisfy the requirements for an absorber except for its somewhat too small band gap energy. Sulfur and copper vacancies are easily formed defects in Cu3SbS4, where the S vacancy shrinks the band gap and degrades the material. This probably explains the experimental findings of a rather poor device performance. The suitable preparation conditions for Cu3SbS4 as an absorber are anticipated to be Cu-poor, Sb-moderate, and S-rich conditions. Herein, isovalent element alloying is demonstrated to be an effective way to increase the gap energy and thereby improve the material properties.
1. Introduction
With the modernization of human society, energy consumption and carbon emission are continuing to grow. To change our world's exploitation of natural resources to a more sustainable system, clean and renewable energy sources should make up the majority of the energy supply in the future. Solar cells directly convert solar light to electricity,1 and the expansion of photovoltaic power stations worldwide has increased over the last decade. The absorber of single junction devices plays a critical role in the power conversion efficiency (PCE). A direct band gap of 1.0–1.5 eV, high absorption coefficient, and small carrier effective masses are regarded as the key screening factors in the search for a candidate absorber of thin-film solar cells.2,3 Both CdTe and Cu(In,Ga)Se2 satisfy these requirements, and their corresponding devices also have a high PCE. The efficiency record for laboratory devices is currently 22.1% and 23.4%4 for CdTe and Cu(In,Ga)Se2, respectively. Commercialized thin-film photovoltaics based on these absorbers are available. Furthermore, the development of organic–inorganic lead halide perovskites has in the last decade experienced rapid progress, and a high PCE of 25.5% efficiency has now been realized.4 However, the toxicity of Cd and Pb as well as the scarcity of Te and In leave some flaws when utilizing these absorbers in large-scale applications. Therefore, searching for an alternative absorber composed of earth-abundant and low-toxicity elements has attracted much attention recently.5 After the cation substitution through two In atoms to one Zn and one Sn in the two units of chalcopyrite CuIn(S,Se)2, the resulting kesterite compound Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 avoids the expensive In element. In addition, it maintains the direct-gap band structure with small carrier effective masses, which is suitable for thin-film solar cells,6,7 and the PCE of devices has reached 13%.4 The absorber is promising for single-junction devices, but also as a compound in tandem cells. The drawback of Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 is the low open-circuit voltage, which may be related to its chemical complexity.8,9 Besides Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4, some other copper antimony sulfides (like CuSbS210–12 and Cu3SbS413–16) and copper tin sulfides (like Cu2SnS317,18 and Cu4SnS419) have also been paid much attention as absorbers for solar cells, since they all comprise earth-abundant and low-toxicity elements.
Copper antimony sulfides involve four major crystallographic phases: CuSbS2 (chalcostibite), Cu3SbS3 (skinnerite), Cu12Sb4S13 (tetrahedrite) and Cu3SbS4 (famatinite).13,14 Generally, CuSbS210–12 and Cu3SbS413–16 have been studied as potential absorbers for solar cells. For example, a PCE of 3.2% has been reported for a device based on CuSbS2.12 However, CuSbS2 has an indirect band gap, as demonstrated by first-principles calculations from different research groups,20–22 and one can expect that non-radiative and destructive Auger recombination limits the device performance. Famatinite Cu3SbS4 (with space group I2m) has a similar tetragonal crystal structure to the well-known absorbers CuInS2 and CuInSe2 (with space group I2d). It can be generated by replacing two In atoms with one Cu and one Sb in two units of CuInS2. A direct Γ-point band gap remains then in Cu3SbS4. However, the width of the gap decreases to 0.8–0.9 eV,13,23 which is somewhat smaller than the optimal value of ideal absorbers in a single junction solar cell. Compared to CuSbS2, the Sb-poor compound Cu3SbS4 has been less explored for photovoltaic applications, and only a PCE of 0.46% has so far been reported.15 Nevertheless, Cu3SbS4 has great potential as an absorber due to its direct band gap; for example, the spectroscopic limited maximum efficiency (SLME) at 2 μm thickness of Cu3SbS4 is as high as 25.9%, which is even higher than that of CuSbS2 (22.9%).24
To evaluate a compound as an absorber in order to realize high device efficiency, an understanding of its electronic structure and defect property is of very basic importance.25–27 The electronic band structure, carrier effective masses, absorption coefficient, etc. yield insights for describing optical properties and carrier transport. In addition, the properties of native defects provide details on anticipated concentrations of impurities and how the optoelectronic properties are modified by the impurities. It can thereby help in pointing out the suitable growth conditions as a guidance for sample preparation in order to avoid detrimental defects, like for instance, defects with in-gap transition levels. Moreover, adjusting the band gap energy through alloying with isovalent elements is a widely adopted method for solar cell absorbers. For example, both CuInSe228 and Cu2ZnSnSe429 have band gap energies of around 1.0 eV, which are narrower than the ideal gap energy of about 1.3 eV.30 After Ga alloying in CuInSe2 and S alloying in Cu2ZnSnSe4, the band gaps increase, and thereby higher PCEs have been realized in devices with the corresponding alloys Cu(In,Ga)Se231 and Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4.32 For famatinite Cu3SbS4, however, the electronic structure, defect properties, and approaches to optimize the band gap have not been fully explored, and this lack of knowledge could be a hindrance for further material development to improve its optoelectronic properties.
In this work, the nature of the electronic structure, the effects due to the presence of defects, as well as the possibility to modulate the band gap energy of famatinite Cu3SbS4 have been studied by first-principles calculations. We find that Cu3SbS4 indeed has a direct band gap (0.85 eV) and suitable carrier effective masses. The p-type conductivity originates from Cu vacancies, while the S vacancy forms a neutral charge state within the band gap region; these two vacancies are the dominating intrinsic defects. Disadvantageously, S vacancies induce a band gap shrinkage which is unfavored for the PCE. Therefore, from the computed formation enthalpies we suggest appropriate growth conditions that minimize the presence of S vacancies in the compound. Moreover, we demonstrate that alloying isovalent elements with a high concentration can significantly widen the band gap and thereby improve the SLME. As a result, we anticipate that Cu3SbS4 and its corresponding alloys can be further developed and regarded as promising absorbers for thin-film solar cells owing to their earth-abundant and low-toxicity properties.
2. Computational details
Our first-principles calculations were based on density functional theory (DFT) and performed with the Vienna Ab-initio Simulation Package (VASP).33 The projector augmented-wave implementation34 was used to describe the interactions between the valence electrons and the frozen core electrons. The hybrid functional HSE06 developed by Heyd, Scuseria, and Ernzerhof35 was chosen as the exchange–correlation functional. Although the Kohn–Sham eigenvalues rather accurately describes the ground state electronic structure, Kohn–Sham energies are not the exact single-particle energies, even with the exact exchange–correlation functional.36 Different exchange–correlation functionals can have very different band-gap energies, but still similar band dispersion (e.g. effective masses).37 Traditional exchange–correlation functionals like LDA or GGA underestimate the band gap in general. HSE06 as a kind of hybrid density functional can produce acceptable band gaps with respect to the experimental results.38 The percentage of the exact non-local Fock exchange (α) and the screening parameter (ω) was kept as the default values α = 25% and ω = 0.2 Å−1. The cutoff energy was set to 500 eV throughout the work, with an energy convergence of 10−4 eV. For calculations of the primitive unit cell, the Γ-centered 6 × 6 × 3 Monkhorst–Pack39k-point meshes were applied. For the defect formation energy calculations, 2 × 2 × 1 supercells with ∼64 atoms were utilized, where the lattice constants were fixed to be the optimized ideal lattice, whereupon the internal coordinates were fully relaxed. For the supercell with neutral defect complexes, the point defects were arranged in close configuration. The k-point meshes were adjusted to the Γ-centered 2 × 2 × 2 meshes for the supercells. Total and partial density of states (DOS and PDOS) are calculated with these meshes by using a tetrahedron smearing method with a smearing width of 0.08 eV. Potential alignment as well as the image charge corrections were considered for the defect formation energy.40 The static dielectric constant ε0 = 10.74 required for image charge correction was taken from the literature.41 For the calculations of different S vacancy concentrations as well as for the calculations of isovalent element alloying, the complete crystalline structures including lattice constants and internal coordinates were relaxed. To test the convergence of the defect formation energy and transition level with respect to the choice of supercell size and adopted correction methods, we performed the calculations of Cu vacancy and S vacancy with 2√2 × 2√2 × 1 supercells, which corresponds to about 128 atoms. The results indicated that the differences in the defect formation energies are less than 0.1 eV for both Cu vacancy and S vacancy, compared to the corresponding values from calculations with the 64-atom cells. The transition level for Cu vacancy was changed by only 0.01 eV (i.e., 0.14 eV from the 2 × 2 × 1 supercell vs. 0.15 eV from the 2√2 × 2√2 × 1 supercell). Moreover, there is no transition level in the band gap region for the S vacancy, neither with the small nor with the larger supercell.
The absorption coefficient was determined from , where ω is the photon frequency and c is the speed of light.42 The imaginary part ε2(ω) of the dielectric function is computed within the DFT from the joint DOS integrated over the Brillouin zone with the weight of the momentum matrix elements. The real part ε1(ω) of the dielectric function is determined directly from ε2(ω) by the Kramer–Kronig relationship.43 As an upgraded approach to estimate the maximum device efficiency over the Shockley–Queisser (SQ) limit,44 the SLME proposed by Yu and Zunger24,30 employs the specific properties of the compounds (such as, band structure, absorption coefficient, etc.) to calculate the theoretical efficiency as a function of film thickness. The traditional model of the SQ limit depends only on the band gap energy, that is, irrespectively how the material absorbs light. In the SLME approach, however, the band gap as well as the optical absorption spectra are considered for theoretical efficiency. It is known that the direct and indirect band gap materials show different carrier recombination rates, and the indirect band gap materials generally have a much higher recombination rate. The electron–hole recombination rate can be roughly divided into radiative and nonradiative mechanisms. To consider the difference related to direct and indirect band structures, the fraction of radiative electron–hole recombination current fr = exp(−(Edag − Eg)/kBT) is employed, where Edag is the directly allowed band gap and Eg is the fundamental band gap. The absorptivity a(E) is described by a Heaviside step function in the traditional SQ limit, while it is defined as a(E) = 1 − exp(−2α(E)L) in the extended SLME model. Here, α(E) is the absorption coefficient from our DFT calculations and L is the thickness of the absorber film.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Electronic structure of pure Cu3SbS4

Fig. 1 illustrates the crystal structure of famatinite Cu3SbS4, which is rather similar to that of the chalcopyrite compound. In famatinite Cu3SbS4 each cation (i.e., Cu or Sb) bonds with four S atoms, and each S atom bonds with four cations (i.e., three Cu atoms and one Sb atom). The Sb and Cu layer and pure Cu layer as the cation layers are arranged along the c axis alternately. Hence, there are two kinds of Cu Wyckoff positions in famatinite Cu3SbS4. We denoted the Cu atom in the Sb and Cu layer as Cu1 (i.e., positioned on the 2b site) while the Cu atom in the pure Cu layer is denoted as Cu2 (i.e., the 4d site). Our calculated lattice constants are a = b = 5.399 Å and c = 10.803 Å, in line with the experimental values a = b = 5.391 Å and c = 10.763 Å.45Fig. 2a presents the electronic band structure of Cu3SbS4, excluding the spin–orbit coupling (SOC). The DFT with the standard HSE06 functional yield a semiconductor with a direct band gap of 0.85 eV. As expected for the sulfur compound, the inclusion of the SOC has only a small impact on the result; the gap energy decreases to 0.84 eV. Our calculated results are in line with the experimental results of 0.84 eV,23 0.88 eV,24,46 and 0.89 eV13,47 from optical transmission spectra measurement and 0.83 eV from spectroscopic ellipsometry measurement.13 Our calculated value also agrees with earlier HSE06 results without an SOC of 0.85 eV48 and 0.86 eV.49 Therefore, the band gaps for Cu3SbS4 with upper and lower limits are 0.86 ± 0.03 and 0.85 ± 0.01 eV for the above experimental reports and HSE06 calculations, respectively. Experimentally, the band gap difference between low (∼10 K) and room temperature does not show a significant change while it cannot be neglected between low and high temperature (∼1000 K).50,51 This is the reason why the band gap under 0 K from DFT calculation can be compared with that under room temperature from experiments. The character of the valence band maximum (VBM) and conduction band minimum (CBM) are important for understanding carrier scattering and transport. We therefore determined the irreducible representations of these states by a group theoretical approach.52 The VBM consists of a double degenerate Γ5 symmetry (i.e., four states if one considers spin), and the third valence band is 11 meV below with Γ4 symmetry; see Table 1. Spin–orbit coupling splits the VBM by 24 meV into Γ7 ⊕ Γ6 states, where the topmost state has Γ7 symmetry. The single degenerate CBM has Γ1 symmetry, which corresponds to Γ6 for the double group.

The partial densities of states (PDOS) of Cu1, Cu2, Sb, and S in pure Cu3SbS4 are depicted in Fig. 2b. One can observe that the top valence band region originates mainly from Cu-d like states and S-p like states while the lower conduction band region primarily comes from Sb-s states and S-p states. Fig. 2c presents the crystal orbital overlap populations (COOP),53 which are calculated from the projection of the DOS on a specific molecular bond. The positive, zero, and negative values represent the electron density increasing, unchanging, and decreasing in the interatomic area by comparing it to the summation of the electron densities of the two neighboring atoms without interaction.54 This corresponds to the bonding (COOP > 0), non-bonding (COOP = 0), and anti-bonding (COOP < 0) feature of each electronic state, respectively. By combining the PDOS and COOP, one obtains that the VBM is from the anti-bonding state between Cu-d states and S-p states, whereas the bonding state between Cu-d states and S-p states is located between −7 and −4 eV. Correspondingly, the CBM is from the anti-bonding state between Sb-s states and S-p states, whereas the bonding character between Sb-s states and S-p states is located around −10 eV. These components of VBM and CBM are very similar to those of the chalcopyrite compounds, like CuGaS2,55 for which the cation Ga-s states have the same role as the cation Sb-s states in Cu3SbS4.
To evaluate the material's capability to respond optically and to transport free electrons and holes, we have determined the carrier effective masses of Cu3SbS4 by fitting the calculated energy dispersion E(k) at the band edges according to a parabolic expression. The calculated carrier effective masses with and without SOC are listed in Table 1. In contrast to an only small impact on the band gap, the SOC plays a significant influence on the hole effective masses, especially for the mass components along the [110]-direction. The value of the uppermost valence band in the [110]-direction is reduced by a factor of 10 when including the SOC; that is, from 3.74me to 0.30me. The electron effective masses are very much isotropic, while the hole effective masses show an anisotropic character. This can be directly related to the electronic states of the CBM and VBM, respectively. The electronic states around the CBM are from the delocalized antibonding Sb-s and S-p states, whereas a part of the electronic states around the VBM is from the localized Cu-d state. Furthermore, our calculated carrier effective masses (with SOC) are similar to those of the well-known absorber kesterite Cu2ZnSnS456 and lighter than those of CuSbS2. According to a former theoretical study,57 the calculated hole effective masses of CuSbS2 (neglecting the SOC) are 3.93me in the direction VBM toward Γ and 3.76me in the direction VBM toward the Z directions. Moreover, in that study the electron effective masses were calculated as 0.56me and 1.13me in the CBM–Γ and CBM–Y directions, respectively. The results should be related to the different crystal structures and local bonding characters. In Cu3SbS4, each S atom bonds with 3 Cu atoms and 1 Sb atom, and the generated Cu–S–Sb tetrahedrons are linked as a three-dimensional network. However, in CuSbS2 some of the S atoms bond with only 2 Cu atoms and 1 Sb atom, which describes a two-dimensional layered structure. The compact bonding structure in Cu3SbS4 results in a stronger interaction and a more delocalized electronic state at the band edges. In addition, Xiao et al.58 highlighted that semiconductors with a high electronic dimensionality are more promising as absorbers in perovskite-based photovoltaic absorbers. The three-dimensional connected and two-dimensional layered structures will produce the corresponding electronic dimensionality in Cu3SbS4 and CuSbS2, respectively. Based on this discussion of electronic dimensionality and carrier transport, Cu3SbS4 is expected to be a better solar cell absorber than CuSbS2.
3.2 Defect property in Cu3SbS4
Defects in absorbers exert an important influence on the PCE of the solar cell; therefore, it is essential to investigate the defect property in Cu3SbS4. We have calculated the defect formation energy59 based on a periodic supercell model, and then the different supercell models containing different intrinsic defects were utilized for analysing the material's defect physics, following the procedure of our earlier works.60,61 To start, the allowed chemical potential ranges have to be determined ranges before calculating the defect formation energy. That is, the relative chemical potentials of different elements (i.e. ΔμCu, ΔμSb, and ΔμS) can be altered which reflects different growth conditions of the sample preparation. To maintain the stability of the host, the sum of each relative chemical potential multiplied by the subscript of molecular formula should be equal to the formation enthalpy of Cu3SbS4: 3ΔμCu + ΔμSb + 4ΔμS = ΔH(Cu3SbS4) = –2.57 eV.(1)Here, the calculated formation enthalpies describe all compounds at zero pressure and zero temperature according to the equation:62 (2)where Etot(An1Bn2Cn3) is the calculated total energy per formula unit of the compound An1Bn2Cn3 (n3 is zero for binary compounds) and μ0i is the total energy per atom of the elements A, B, and C in their elemental reference phase. Our calculated formation enthalpy of Cu3SbS4 is in very good agreement with the experimental value –2.57 eV.63
To avoid elementary substance precipitation, the relative chemical potentials should not be greater than zero: ΔμCu ≤ 0, ΔμSb ≤ 0, and ΔμS ≤ 0.(3)Other possible binary and ternary impurity compounds should also be prevented; therefore, the relative chemical potentials need to satisfy a series of inequations related to the formation enthalpies of the competing compounds: 12ΔμCu + 4ΔμSb + 13ΔμS ≤ ΔH(Cu12Sb4S13) ≤ −8.74 eV,(4) 3ΔμCu + ΔμSb + 3ΔμS ≤ ΔH(Cu3SbS3) ≤ −1.66 eV,(5) ΔμCu + ΔμSb + 2ΔμS ≤ ΔH(CuSbS2) ≤ −1.24 eV,(6) 2ΔμSb + 3ΔμS ≤ ΔH(Sb2S3) ≤ −1.27 eV,(7) 2ΔμCu + ΔμS ≤ ΔH(Cu2S) ≤ −0.83 eV,(8) 3ΔμCu + 2ΔμS ≤ ΔH(Cu3S2) ≤ −1.08 eV,(9) 7ΔμCu + 4ΔμS ≤ ΔH(Cu7S4) ≤ −2.99 eV,(10) ΔμCu + ΔμS ≤ ΔH(CuS) ≤ −0.50 eV,(11) 10ΔμCu + 3ΔμSb ≤ ΔH(Cu10Sb3) ≤ −0.46 eV,(12) 11ΔμCu + 3ΔμSb ≤ ΔH(Cu11Sb3) ≤ −0.42 eV,(13) 2ΔμCu + ΔμSb ≤ ΔH(Cu2Sb) ≤ −0.17 eV.(14)From the above constraints, the gray areas in Fig. 3a are determined for the allowed chemical potential range of Cu3SbS4. Within this boundary, we explicitly consider five extreme growth condition points (denoted A to E). The detailed values of ΔμCu, ΔμSb, and ΔμS under various prepared conditions are also presented in Fig. 3a.

Points A, B, C, D, and E in (a) represent the five extreme conditions considered in this work. (b–f) The calculated formation energies of intrinsic defects in Cu3SbS4 under different chemical potential conditions. 

Fig. 3b–f describe the defect formation energies of intrinsic defects under different chemical potential conditions. One can observe that the defects Cu vacancy and S vacancy are always easily formed under these possible growth conditions. As expected, the defect formation energies and transition levels for Cu vacancies related to the two different Cu sites do not show any significant difference; the (0/−) transition levels of Cu1 vacancy and Cu2 vacancy are 0.14 and 0.17 eV, respectively. It is also clear that the S vacancy has no charge transition within the band gap region. Therefore, we can conclude that Cu3SbS4 is a p-type semiconductor intrinsically induced by Cu vacancies; this is also consistent with the experimental results.64,65 In order to investigate why there is no transition level of S vacancy, we have calculated the Bader charge in the supercell with a S vacancy. We have found that the Bader charge of the Sb atom close to the S vacancy (i.e. the Sb atom formerly bonded with the removed S atom) is ∼2e while the Bader charges of other Sb atoms are nearly zero. This means the Sb atom close to the S vacancy is reduced to +3 valence, while the other Sb atoms maintain +5 valence. Therefore, the formation of the S vacancy can be regarded as a kind of local n- and p-type defects self-passivation, which is one +3 valence Sb substituting at one +5 valence Sb plus one charged S vacancy (i.e., [SbSb2− + VS2+]0) and then the S vacancy can remain charge neutral. The n- and p-type defects passivation66 has been proposed to eliminate the recombination centre induced by an intrinsic defect or monodoping impurity and have been widely applied in photoelectrochemical water splitting studies.67 In addition, Cu3SbS3 and Cu12Sb4S13 (i.e., Cu3SbS3.25) can be expressed as Cu3SbS4−□ (□ = 1 and 0.75), and then regarded as sulfur-poor compounds compared to Cu3SbS4. The fact that S vacancies are so easily formed in the growth of Cu3SbS4 could also be related to the existing sulfur-poor compounds Cu3SbS3 and Cu12Sb4S13. Since the VBMs come from the antibonding states between Cu-d states and anion-p states in these Cu-based compounds (CuInSe2, Cu2ZnSnS4, and Cu3SbS4, etc.), they have a high energy position versus vacuum.68–70 According to the doping limit rule in semiconductors,71 it is easy to achieve p-type doping and hard to form n-type defects with a large doping concentration if the semiconductor has a high ionization potential. Consistent with that rule, the prominent native impurities are the p-type defects VCu and CuIn/Zn in both chalcopyrite CuInSe272 and kesterite Cu2ZnSnS4.73 Here, the significant defects in Cu3SbS4 are p-type VCu and the electrically inert VS. The anion vacancy is commonly regarded as an n-type defect in a semiconductor. Since the Sb atom next to the S vacancy undergoes a transition of valence state from 5+ to 3+, it becomes a defect with a neutral charge state. Thereby, it can also be easily formed during growth. Hence, keeping the charge balance around a defect should be one of the required conditions to have low formation energy of the defect.
The defects in Cu3SbS4 with deep transition levels, like CuSb, SbCu, SbS, and SSb, etc., can act as recombination centers, and they are regarded as detrimental defects for the absorber. Fortunately, they all have high formation energies, and hence are unlikely to deteriorate the device performance.
We thus conclude that the p-type conductivity arises due to Cu vacancies, since it has the lowest formation energy among the native p-type defects. Moreover, our results show that interstitial Cu (Cui) will act as the main compensating donor, since that defect has the lowest formation energy among the native n-type defects when the Fermi energy level is close to the VBM. Based on the formation energies of single defects, the defect complex [Cui + VCu]0 is the most likely to form. Our calculated formation energies for both [Cui + VCu1]0 and [Cui + VCu2]0 are 1.29 eV, which indicates that we do not expect high concentrations of these complexes in Cu3SbS4. If Cui migrates to VCu in the defect complex [Cui + VCu]0 by thermal treatment (e.g., annealing), the sample approaches its perfect crystal structure. In addition, our calculated formation energies of cation disorder defect complexes [CuSb + SbCu1]0 and [CuSb + SbCu2]0 are 3.31 and 3.45 eV, respectively, which are remarkably higher than 0.94 eV of [CuIn + InCu]0 in CuInSe274 and 0.26 eV of [CuZn + ZnCu]0 in Cu2ZnSnS4.75 This is related to the large valence difference between Cu and Sb in Cu3SbS4, and thereby the cation disorder induces a large variation on the octet rule of the electrons for the anion which costs much more energy to produce.74 Therefore, in Cu2ZnSnS4 the cation disorder induces a band tail and causes a reduction of the open-circuit voltage,76–78 but in Cu3SbS4 it is unlikely that this disorder occurs.
Among our considered defects and defect complexes, the S vacancy always has the lowest formation energy when the Fermi energy level stays below the midgap energy; typically, close to the VBM as a p-type semiconductor. The formation energy of VS varies from 0.25 eV under S-poor conditions (point A in Fig. 3a) to 0.65 eV under S-rich conditions (points C and D in Fig. 3a), implying that it is likely to have a large concentration of the vacancies in the samples for any growth conditions. Since the S atoms contribute to both the VBM and CBM, as shown in Fig. 2b and c, the formation of the S vacancy should essentially alter the electronic structure and optoelectronic property of the compound. Consequently, we have investigated the influence of the concentration of the S vacancy on the band gap, absorption coefficient, and SLME. We have considered three different S vacancy concentrations as Cu3SbS4−x (x = 0.125, 0.25, and 0.5). The resulting band gap energies decrease from 0.85, 0.81, and 0.73 to 0.60 eV with x increasing from 0, 0.125, 0.25 to 0.5 in Cu3SbS4−x. As shown in Fig. 4b, after the formation of the S vacancy, the Sb atom next to the S vacancy (i.e., Sb3+, here denoted as Sb*) has moved closer to the S vacancy and the Cu atoms nearby the S vacancy (denoted as Cu#) is displaced away from the S vacancy, which induces a local bonding distortion. After Sb* has moved closer to the S vacancy, the bond lengths between Sb* and the S atoms nearby Sb* (denoted as S*) become longer and the corresponding bonding strengths have reduced. Instead, the bond lengths between S* and the Cu atoms nearby S* (denoted as Cu*) become shorter and the corresponding bonding strengths have enhanced. This is reflected by the fact that the average bond length between Cu* and S* decreases from 2.32 Å in pure Cu3SbS4 to 2.29 Å in Cu3SbS3.875 (i.e. Cu3SbS4−x with x = 0.125). After Cu# has been displaced away from the S vacancy, the bond lengths between Cu# and the S atoms nearby Cu# (denoted as S#) are shortened while the bonding strengths might not be enhanced owing to the destruction of the Cu#–S tetrahedron by the presence of S vacancy. Meanwhile, the bond lengths between S# and the Sb atoms nearby S# (denoted as Sb#) become longer and the corresponding bonding strengths are reduced, reflecting that the bond length between Sb# and S# increases from 2.39 Å in pure Cu3SbS4 to 2.40 Å in Cu3SbS3.875. Therefore, the VBM from the antibonding states between Cu*-d states and S*-p states is pushed energetically upwards owing to the decrease of the bond length between Cu* and S* while the CBM from the antibonding states between Sb#-s states and S#-p states drops downward due to the increase of the bond length between Sb# and S#. The above explanation is supported by the PDOS of Cu3SbS3.875 that evinces a band gap shrinkage after the formation of the S vacancy; see Fig. 4a. In addition, we have found that Sb3+ has no substantial contribution to the DOS at the VBM and CBM. As a consequence of the band gap shrinkage, the calculated absorption coefficient shows a redshift on the absorption edge as well as a decrease in the energy range between 2 to 3 eV as the S vacancy concentration increases; cf.Fig. 4c. The band gap of Cu3SbS4 is already smaller than the ideal gap energy ∼1.3 eV for solar cell absorber, and a reduction of the band gap energy of Cu3SbS4 would reduce the efficiency further. Our calculated SLME for pure Cu3SbS4 is converged at a few μm thicknesses and are 26.7% and 27.0% at the thicknesses of 2 μm and 3 μm, respectively; see Fig. 4d. Like the chalcopyrite Cu(In, Ga)Se2 and kesterite Cu2ZnSn(S, Se)4, a few micrometer thin layer is enough to be an efficient absorber for solar cells. Our calculated results of SLME are in line with the result of 25.9% at the thickness of 2 μm by Yu and Zunger;24 the small deviation is probably due to the different functionals (HSE06 in this work and HSE06 + G0W0 in ref. 24). The values of SLME at the thickness of 3 μm monotonically decrease from 27.0%, 25.8%, 23.5% and 19.4% as x increases from 0, 0.125, and 0.25 to 0.5 as shown in Fig. 4d, respectively. Although the S vacancy is not a defect with a deep transition level, a high concentration of S vacancies should be avoided since it shrinks the band gap. From the experiments, both S-poor16,79 and non-S-poor13,23 samples have been prepared. Especially, a low PCE is reported for the S-poor sample.16 A reduction of the concentration of S vacancies could be a possible path for the improvement of Cu3SbS4 solar cells. The concentration of the S vacancies is evaluated to be 5.65 × 1017 cm−3 under S-rich conditions (C and D points in Fig. 3a) according to the Boltzmann distribution and taking 700 K as the sample growth temperature;13 this is not a large concentration and it will probably not have a significant influence on the gap energy, the light absorption, nor the overall device performance. Furthermore, the calculated band gap energies for the 63-atom supercells with one neutral Cu1 or Cu2 vacancy are 0.91 and 0.94 eV, respectively. This increase of the gap energy can be explained by the fact that VBM is partially Cu-d like, and the anti-bonding Cu-d and S-p character decreases with Cu vacancies. The lowest formation energies for neutral Cu1 vacancy and Cu2 vacancy can also be obtained at point C and equals 0.65 and 0.67 eV, respectively. This will introduce the same order (i.e., 1017 cm−3) of S vacancy concentration and would also not make any remarkable effect on the device performance. Under the chemical environment of point C, the band gap reduction from the S-vacancy can be restrained and the Cu-vacancy can result in moderate p-type conductivity required for the absorber. Therefore, we suggest that the appropriate growth condition for photovoltaic Cu3SbS4 will be Cu-poor, Sb-moderate, and S-rich condition (i.e., point C).

3.3 Band gap optimization through isovalent element alloying
Since the band gap energy of Cu3SbS4 at the optimal growth condition is expected to still be smaller than the value for an ideal solar cell, we attempt to find a way to tune the energy gap. Isovalent element alloying, as a way to optimize the band gap, has been widely taken in the solar cell absorbers like Cu2(Sn, Ge)S3,18 Cu(In, Ga)Se2,31 and Cu2ZnSn(S, Se)4.32 Here, by adopting the model of substituting an atom in a 16-atom cell as Cu3−xAxSbS4 (x = 0.5; A = Ag and Li) and a dopant in a 32-atom cell as Cu3Sb1−yByS4 (y = 0.25; B = As and P), four kinds of alloying models have been considered. We find that for the 16-atom cell, Ag and Li doping at the Cu1 site have a lower formation energy by 77 and 38 meV, respectively than the corresponding doping at the Cu2 site. Therefore, we set up models with Ag and Li insertion as a substitutional dopant on the Cu1 site, As and P substituting an Sb atom, and analyse the effects from the alloying. We find from the band structures that the materials are maintained as direct gap materials, and the widths of band gaps increase to 0.92, 1.14, 0.98, and 1.10 eV after Ag, Li, As, and P alloying, respectively. The increase of the band gap energy is consistent with the blue shift on the absorption edge as shown in Fig. 5a. To investigate the energy shifts of CBM and VBM after element alloying, we have calculated the band offset by aligning the energy level position based on the average potential of the atom far away from the alloying atoms.66,67,80 In Fig. 5b, one can observe that the VBM is primarily shifted down by Ag and Li alloying since the occupied Cu site supplies the electronic state at VBM, while As and P alloying mainly shifts up the CBM as the occupied Sb site provides the electronic state at CBM. The calculated bond lengths of Ag–S and Li–S bonds are 2.53 Å and 2.42 Å in the alloying models, respectively, which are longer than 2.33 Å of the Cu1–S bond in pure Cu3SbS4. This result is consistent with the larger ionic radii of Ag and Li than that of Cu.81 Owing to the longer bond lengths of Ag–S and Li–S bonds in the alloying models, the tetrahedrons from Sb and S next to Ag and Li atoms are compressed and the corresponding bond lengths of Sb–S bonds become shorter. The bond lengths of Sb–S bonds in the Sb–S tetrahedrons next to Ag and Li atoms become 2.38 Å and 2.37 Å, respectively, which are shorter than 2.39 Å, the bond length of the Sb–S bond in pure Cu3SbS4. Since the interaction between Ag and S is weaker than that between Cu and S, the VBM from the antibonding state will drop to a lower position and then the band gap will be widened. Some of p–d antibonding states will not contribute to VBM anymore in Li alloyed compounds. Consequently, VBM will descend and then the band gap will increase. In addition, since the bond length of Sb–S is shortened in Li alloyed compounds, the interaction between Sb and S is enhanced and the antibonding states between Sb-s states and S-p states at the CBM will be pushed to a higher position, leading to a greater band gap. On the other hand, the calculated bond lengths of As–S and P–S bonds are 2.23 Å and 2.09 Å in the alloying models, respectively, shorter than 2.39 Å of the Sb–S bond in pure Cu3SbS4. This result is in accordance with the smaller ionic radii of As and P than that of Sb.81 Due to the shorter bond lengths of As–S and P–S bonds in the alloying models, the tetrahedrons from Cu and S next to Ag and Li atoms are expanded and the average bond lengths of Cu–S bonds become longer. The average bond lengths of Cu1–S bonds in the Cu1–S tetrahedron next to As and P atoms become 2.35 Å and 2.36 Å, respectively, longer than 2.33 Å of the bond length of the Cu1–S bond in pure Cu3SbS4. Since the shorter bond lengths of As–S and P–S bonds and then stronger interactions between As and S and between P and S, the antibonding states between As-s/P-s states and S-p states at the CBM will be pushed to higher positions and then the band gap will increase. As the average bond lengths of Cu1–S in the tetrahedrons next to As and P atoms become longer in the alloying models, the interaction between Cu1 and S is reduced in the alloying models. Thus, the antibonding states between Cu1-d states and S-p states at the VBM will be lowered, leading to the widening of the band gap. The effects on the VBM and CBM energy levels can be utilized to not only optimize the gap energy, but also to tune the band alignment appropriately with the buffer and n-type materials in the devices. As shown in Fig. 5c, the SLMEs of Cu3SbS4 after alloying are converged at a few μm, which demonstrates that the alloys can also be utilized as the absorber for thin-film solar cells. Our calculated SLMEs at a thickness of 3 μm are 28.8%, 30.6%, 29.6%, and 30.9% after Ag, Li, As and P alloying, respectively, all greater than 27.0% in pure Cu3SbS4. As a result, the band gap of Cu3SbS4 can be tuned up by alloying isovalent elements with a high concentration, consequently improving the open-circuit voltage, while the other superior optoelectronic properties are maintained.

To evaluate the feasibility of alloying, we have calculated the formation energies of Ag, Li, As, and P-related defects at point C in 64-atom supercells. Here, besides Ag or Li substituting at the Cu site and As or P substituting at the Sb site, Li or Ag at the interstitial site (i.e. Lii and Agi) and As or P substituting at the S site are considered as the competing defects, which may impede the alloying concentration to reach a large value. The chemical potentials for Ag, Li, As, and P are adopted as the allowed maxima with the following constraints: 2ΔμAg + ΔμS ≤ ΔH(Ag2S) ≤ −0.38 eV,(15) 2ΔμLi + ΔμS ≤ ΔH(Li2S)≤ −4.32 eV,(16) 2ΔμAs + 3ΔμS ≤ ΔH(As2S3) ≤ −0.75 eV,(17) 2ΔμP + 7ΔμS ≤ ΔH(P2S7) ≤ −1.39 eV.(18)As shown in Fig. 6, the isovalent substitutional defects have low formation energies, actually being close to zero. They have their minimum values under S-rich and cation-poor conditions (point C) since the chemical potentials for Ag, Li, As, and P are set as the allowed maxima. It will increase to a positive value when considering the dopant-poor conditions, i.e., the chemical potentials for Ag, Li, As and P were lowered. In addition, the substitutional defects are not intrinsic defects and would not generate spontaneously to make the lattice unstable. Other possible defects have a much higher formation energy, implying that it is easy for the isovalent elements alloying in Cu3SbS4 and they hardly go to the undesired sites. Combining the results on defect formation energies with the above discussion on property improvement, we can conclude that alloying isovalent elements with a high concentration, especially for Li alloying at the Cu site or P alloying at the Sb site, can be regarded as a suitable way to improve the performance of Cu3SbS4 as an earth-abundant and low-toxicity absorber for thin-film solar cells.

4. Conclusion
In summary, the electronic structure, the defect properties, and how to optimize the band gap of famatinite Cu3SbS4 as an earth-abundant and low-toxicity absorber have been studied by the first-principles DFT approach with the HSE06 exchange–correlation functional. We demonstrate that Cu3SbS4 has a direct band gap and suitable carrier effective masses, although the width of the band gap needs to be widened for an efficient absorber. The easily formed defect S vacancy will also result in a band gap reduction, which will limit its efficiency potential. The Cu vacancy is responsible for the p-type conductivity in Cu3SbS4. To optimize its optoelectronic properties related to defects, the suitable growth circumstance for Cu3SbS4 as an absorber is determined to be Cu-poor, Sb-moderate, and S-rich conditions. Alloying isovalent elements with a high concentration, especially for Li alloying at the Cu site or P alloying at the Sb site, has been demonstrated as a feasible way to optimize the band gap and improve the SLME. The realization of a large alloying mixture is supported by the defect formation energy calculation. Overall, Cu3SbS4 and its alloys as earth-abundant and low-toxicity compounds have shown a good prospect to be an absorber for thin-film solar cells.
