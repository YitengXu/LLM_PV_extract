1. Introduction
As widely employed in electrochemical applications like fuel cells, metal–air batteries, and electrolysis cells, oxygen redox reactions, including the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), with fast kinetics are highly desired to reduce irreversible potential loss and thus improve the energy efficiency of electrochemical processes. Unfortunately, either the ORR or the OER suffers from a sluggish reaction rate due to multiple charge transfer processes and a high activation barrier.1 Electrocatalysts based on precious metals, such as Pt, Ir, Ru, Rh, and Au, show excellent catalytic performance for the ORR and OER. However, their shortcomings are also fatal, including high cost, limited durability, natural scarcity, and poor resistance to poisoning, which restrict large-scale commercial deployment.2,3 In order to migrate the drawbacks of precious metal catalysts, scaling down the strategy of developing nanoscale catalysts has been proven practical. Nanoscale materials of pure precious metals or alloys with diverse morphologies have been developed, and continuous efforts have been made in tuning the nanostructure and further decreasing the critical dimensions of catalysts. The breakthrough progress has been archived until the emergence of single-atom catalysts (SACs).4,5
SACs, defined as materials that only contain single atoms dispersed on supports without any appreciable interaction between them,6 have become a new research frontier for electrochemical reactions. SACs represent the ultimate form of the scaling down strategy, with the theoretically minimum metal size and maximum utilization efficiency. Since the presentation of the concept in 2011, SACs have been drawing intensive research attention.7,8 Recent studies have shown the viability of using SACs for catalyzing diverse elementary electrochemical reactions, such as the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), hydrogen evolution reaction (HER),9,10 CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR),11–14etc.15,16 It is found that precious-metal-based SACs exhibited stunning catalytic activities for electrochemical energy technologies.17–19 For instance, Liu et al. reported a carbon black-supported Pt single-atom electrocatalyst for the ORR with a power density up to 680 mW cm−2 at 80 °C in acidic single-cells.20 Considering the shortcomings of precious-metal catalysts, a further step has been taken to eliminate the use of precious metal catalysts by developing non-precious metal single-atom catalysts (NPM-SACs), especially in the last five years. In 2019, Zhang et al. reported graphene supported single-atom Fe–N5 sites in catalyzing the CO2 reduction process with superior faradaic efficiency (ca. 99.7%) for CO production at a low overpotential of 0.35 V, outperforming reported traditional Fe–N–C catalysts.21 Non-precious metals, particularly transition metals such as Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, and Zn, combined with nonmetal dopants (N, P, S, B, and O), were found to show desirable catalytic activities for oxygen redox reactions and were regarded as a promising candidate to replace precious-metal catalysts. Compared with traditional non-precious-metal catalysts comprised of metal particles or clusters, NPM-SACs demonstrate reduced possibility to be oxidized and superior stability especially in acidic media as a consequence of the strong bonding between metal single atoms and supports. The utilization of metal precursors is relatively low. Thus, the fabrication of NPM-SACs would be more cost effective. Moreover, it is easier to probe the coordination of single atoms on various supports rather than the complicated structure of conventional metal-involved materials, thus allowing for further prediction of reaction dynamics in the catalytic process. To date, NPM-SACs have already been dramatically developed and presented a competitive or even better electrocatalytic performance compared with bulk precious-metal catalysts and traditional precious-metal free catalysts.9,10,22
The confinement of NPM-SAs relies on strong covalent bonds via either doping or anchoring on various supports, and NPM-SAs generally remain coordinatively unsaturated to provide active sites in an electrochemical reaction process. Thus, there is no doubt that the type of support is vital in the design of highly active NPM-SACs. The promising supports requires comparably large surface area, excellent conductivity, strong metal–support coordination, and comparably high stability to ensure the confinement of NPM-SAs and superior electrochemical catalytic performance.23 The most reported carbon nanomaterials, especially graphene-like materials, well satisfy the above requirements, attracting extensive interest in the synthesis of NPM-SACs.24 Besides carbon-based supports, multiple 1D–3D substrates (Fig. 1, metals, metal oxides, non-metal oxides, etc.) have been widely explored for oxygen redox reactions in fundamental research and experimental application as well.15,25 In this review, we summarize various strategies employed in the facile preparation of recently developed NPM-SACs confined on different dimensional supports. Then we introduce the characterization methods used to identify active sites in NPM-SACs, including physical and chemical techniques. Advanced computational modelling and relevant simulation methods are used to find out the reaction mechanism of oxygen redox reactions catalyzed by NPM-SACs. The electrocatalytic activities of currently developed NPM-SACs for the ORR and OER, and bifunctional performance have been systematically evaluated. For the first time, the effect of the support morphology on catalytic performance has been extensively discussed and compared. Finally, the major challenges and the future prospects of NPM-SACs are presented based on our understanding of the recent development.

2. Synthesis
A variety of experimental techniques have been presented for the preparation of NPM-SACs (1D, 2D, and 3D), such as ball milling, electrochemical deposition, physical and chemical vapor deposition, wet-chemistry pyrolysis, and thermal and microwave pyrolysis. In spite of the diverse approaches, the facile fabrication methods have been extensively discussed. It is noticeable that high-temperature pyrolysis plays a dominant role in the synthesis process of NPM-SACs. In the following, detailed preparation methods are summarized and divided according to different dimensional supports of NPM-SACs.
Generally, the stable anchoring of NPM-SAs on 1D supports is difficult to achieve due to the intrinsic closed tubular structure of 1D nanomaterials. There is limited literature reporting the successful fabrication of NPM-SACs confined on 1D supports with excellent electrochemical performance. Confined NPM-SAs can be directly exposed to the surface of 1D supports or can be embedded inside 1D structures with the capability of modulating the electronic properties of the coordination environment into intrinsically inactive 1D materials to trigger catalytic activity. 2D nanomaterial supported NPM-SACs can more easily be accurately probed by advanced characterization techniques. The open structure on both sides on 2D substrates enables a more expedited mass-transfer process than those on 1D or 3D supports and significantly maximizes the catalytic reaction rates. 3D structures are comparably complex compared with low-dimensional supports, and thus have been intensively investigated as substrates of NPM-SACs. The complicated structure of 3D provides more anchoring sites for metal single atoms and the possibility of dual-metal or multi-metal confinement. However, it is difficult to further predict the local atomic structure as well as the local electronic states of single metal atoms on 3D supports.
2.1 NPM-SAs confined on 1D nanomaterials
One-dimensional nanomaterials, such as nanorods (NRs), nanotubes (NTs), nanowires (NWs), and nanofibers (NFs), have attracted considerable attention in electrocatalysis due to their intrinsic advantages compared to 0D nanoparticles.26 Among them, hollow carbon nanotubes (CNTs) show a much higher specific surface area as well as better mass transport properties than the other two structures, which were used as promising supports for various electrochemical applications.27–31 Moreover, carbon nanotubes also take the advantages of common carbon materials, like rich sources, low cost, and strong tolerance to acidic and alkaline environments.5,32–34 Heteroatom doped CNTs, especially N-doped CNTs, have been widely investigated by computational and experimental studies and been proven to enhance the electrocatalytic activities of pristine CNTs through changing the electronic state by replacing C atoms with N atoms.35–41 On the basis of N-doped CNTs, Liu and co-workers designed transition-metal-based catalysts (M/N–CNTs, M = Fe, Co, and Ni) via a solid-state pyrolysis process, providing a general fabrication strategy of 1D CNT supported electrocatalysts.42
The combination of NPM-SAs and CNTs has been conducted very recently. Generally, NPM-SACs supported on CNTs could be synthesized through two commonly used technical routes: (1) thermal decomposition of a pre-treated carbon nanotube matrix with metal-containing precursors; (2) self-assembly of carbon nanotubes through template-free pyrolysis with the addition of metal precursors. For the first route, Guo et al. demonstrated a 1D core–shell cable structure of Co–P, N–CNT where the Co single atoms were embedded in a carbon sheath (shell structure in Fig. 2a).2 In their study, commercial multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) were firstly treated with acid and then coated with resorcinol, melamine, and formaldehyde on the surface. Following that, the obtained RMF@CNT mixed with cobalt nitrate hexahydrate underwent high-temperature pyrolysis under N2. In this route, the unique coating played a key role in preventing the structural changes and connecting the CNTs with transition metal precursors. This kind of ‘core–shell’ morphology with CNTs as the inner cores could also be observed in other studies, such as CNT@Fe–N–PC (polypyrrole as the coating)43 and M@N-doped MWCNTs (M = Co, Fe, or Cu, with PDA as the coating).44

In terms of the second route, Zhao's group designed Ni single atoms stabilized on a nitrogen-doped carbon nanotube structure (NiSA–N–CNT) via a facile one-pot pyrolysis method (Fig. 2b).45 The in situ formation mechanism of the carbon nanotubular structure had been investigated. The results showed that the intermediate Ni–g-C3N4 played a critical role in this process. Different from the growth mechanism of CNTs based on transition-metal nanoparticles,46–48 the rolling-up step of layered Ni–g-C3N4 was driven by internal stress which was high enough at 700–900 °C. In addition, the presence of Ni single atoms accelerates the formation of CNTs through enhancing the thermal stability of g-C3N4 and preventing it from complete condensation. Cheng et al. further concluded that the strong covalent bonding between the Ni atoms and g-C3N4 confines would also inhibit the single atom aggregation in the pyrolysis process.
A new approach based on hard template synthesis was recently developed.49 As shown in Fig. 2c, tubular non-precious-metal (hydr)oxide (e.g.: α-FeOOH nanorods) has also been selected as a hard template for CNTs and generally coated with an organic polymer (polydopamine, PDA) before the high-temperature carbonization process. The unstable species was removed with a final acid etching treatment and the NPM-SAs were completely exposed to the inner wall after this step. Moreover, Cheng et al. utilized electrospinning integrated with a high-temperature carbonization process to produce Co or Fe single atoms and N CNFs (∼150 nm), which provided a novel method for the synthesis of NPM-SACs.50
2.2 NPM-SAs confined on 2D nanomaterials
2D materials confining NPM-SACs show particularly unique features compared with other dimensional structures.51,52 For instance, metal single atoms supported on 2D materials tend to be more coordinatively unsaturated and can more easily be exposed to reactants, which ensures maximum utilization of metal single atoms and maximizes the electrocatalytic reaction rates as well.

2.2.1 NPM-SAs confined on graphene-family nanomaterials. 
As the most widely used 2D material which approaches the physical thickness limit, graphene exhibits remarkable properties, particularly the highest surface area and conductivity among inorganic materials.53 A large number of graphene-like 2D materials have been increasingly developed, such as graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4), transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), and 2D metal–organic frameworks (MOFs). Besides traditional graphene, other graphene-family nanomaterials, such as multi-layered graphene, graphene oxide (GO) and reduced graphene oxide (rGO), and materials fabricated from the above precursors, are highly favourable supports for oxygen redox reactions because they contain abundant edges, defects, or dopants which contribute to a higher density of active sites.54,55 Similar to CNTs, heteroatom doping on graphene-based materials brings about improved electrocatalytic activities. Moreover, the co-doping of a metal center and typical non-metal heteroatoms (N, S, O, P, etc.) enhances the electroactivity and electrocatalytic durability of the origin graphene due to the metal and metal-free dopants.56 N-doped graphene, especially, has shown potential for stabilizing metal atomic species as well as for catalysing electrochemical reactions.57
Universally, graphene-family nanomaterial confining NPM-SAs could be classified into single-atom confined and atomic metal–Nx site confined catalysts. Single atoms could interact with the oxygen groups or C atoms in defects. For example, Ni2+ cations were directly dispersed in defective graphene (DG) and reduced in a nitrogen atmosphere as shown in Fig. 3a.58 The Ni nanoparticles were removed via hydrochloric acid latching treatment and only Ni single atoms were finally anchored into the DG with a high loading up to 1.24 wt%. For atomic metal–Nx site confined graphene-family catalysts, there are various promising carbon precursors which are able to serve as supports. Graphene oxide (GO), which could be reduced to rGO through a thermal annealing process, could provide a tremendous number of vacancies for incorporating N and for anchoring metal single atoms. The intrinsic interfering species also prevent the formation of amorphous carbon and the configuration of the transition metal centers.44,59 Fei et al. employed a general route to prepare atomic metal embedded in nitrogen-doped holey graphene frameworks (M–NHGF) via facile hydrothermal and pyrolysis processes in the presence of GO, inorganic metal salts (e.g.: FeCl3, CoCl2, NiCl2, etc.), and H2O2 serving as precursors.60

Generally, the as-prepared or post-treated graphene could directly act as the supports to form NPM-SACs.61–65 Hou and co-workers designed atomically dispersed nickel coordinated with nitrogen and sulfur species in porous carbon nanosheets where electrochemically exfoliated graphene (EG) foil, dicyandiamide, thiophene, and Ni salts were used as the template and the sources of carbon, nitrogen, sulfur, and Ni-single-atoms, respectively.65 Indirect fabrication of graphene-based supports could mainly be carried out in the presence of g-C3N4 or organic sources for the polymerization of g-C3N4. As shown in Fig. 3b, pre-designed bimetallic Zn/Fe polyphthalocyanine (ZnFe-BPPc) was first polymerized in the presence of urea.66 Then the mixture underwent a high-temperature annealing process and was transformed into N-doped porous carbon (NPC) which anchored atomically dispersed Fe–N4 sites. Zn here was selected as the doping metal because it could evaporate itself above 907 °C. In addition, the existence of Zn also prevented the formation of Fe–Fe bonds, and thus ensured a stable Fe–N4 atomic structure in NPC. It is noticeable that the employment of Zn has become an annealing design approach of NPM-SACs which could be seen in the following for different types of supports.


2.2.2 NPM-SAs confined on other 2D nanomaterials. 
Two-dimensional ultrathin nanosheet structures derived from a nitrogen-free Cu metal–organic-framework (MOF) can also be used as 2D supports for NPM-SAs (as shown in Fig. 4a).67 During the process, dicyandiamide was added as the nitrogen resources. More importantly, it helped to form highly stable single atomic non-noble-metal doped catalysts. Through a bottom-up synthesis process, Cu single atoms with high contents were securely trapped in the nitrogenated carbon nanosheets (see in Fig. 4a).67 Different from 2D graphene materials, graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4), consisting of sp2 C atoms and high-level pyridine-like N atoms, is regarded as a special case of N-doped graphene. Compared with other C3N4 allotropes, g-C3N4 exhibits a smaller bandgap and higher chemical stability due to its particular electronic structure.68 Based on Chen et al.'s research, g-C3N4 supported SACs could be obtained by a direct or post-synthesis process. The direct synthesis method based on a bottom-up process seemed to be more promising for loading a higher content of single metal atoms on g-C3N4, where consistent results were also indicated in Liu et al.'s and Chen et al.'s study.69–71 In terms of direct fabrication approaches, S. Ohn and co-workers incorporated Ni-based molecular species into in-plane porous g-C3N4 (Ni–CN) through subsequent thermal treatment of a mixture of melamine and Ni containing inorganic salts as shown in Fig. 4b.72 Except for the above 2D materials, graphdiyne, as a new 2D periodic carbon allotrope with a one-atom-thick layer built from sp− and sp2− hybridized carbon atoms, exhibits the possibility to act as a substrate for individual metal atoms. Gao et al. used Fe3+ adsorbed graphdiyne to fabricate Fe-single-atom confined graphdiyne via low-temperature pyrolysis at 110 °C. The structural stability and electrocatalytic activity had been predicted by theoretical calculation in advance, which well agreed with experimental findings. Thus, this kind of proof-of-concept fabrication strategy provides a rational design principle for different functional NPM-SACs.73

It is notable that carbon-based 2D nanomaterials play a dominated role in the synthesis of NPM-SACs. However, the drawbacks of carbon-based supports, especially their thermodynamically corrosion under high potential, are inevitable.74 To avoid this kind of problem, other kinds of supports confining NPM-SAs have been studied. As shown in Fig. 4c, Chen et al. established a new strategy to produce NPM-SACs via regulation of spin states for the first time.75 Delocalized spin states for Ni atoms in the ultrathin nanosheets of nickel chalcogenides were prepared using an inorganic–organic hybrid intermediate assisted liquid-exfoliation strategy. After the spin states of the atomic layers of nickel chalcogenides were delocalized, their electronic structures were simultaneously modified, resulting in enhanced electron transport and elevated water absorption ability.

2.3 NPM-SAs confined on 3D nanomaterials
Compared with 1D or 2D substrates, 3D configurations were developed in more recent years. Among all kinds of high-dimensional nanomaterials, 3D porous carbonaceous nanomaterials have attracted extensive attention in recent research. The intrinsic electrocatalytic activities of 3D materials such as a high surface area, extrinsic physicochemical activities, and good mechanical and chemical stability are crucial for serving as feasible supports in single-atom catalysts.76–78 Herein, we will demonstrate the synthesis strategies of 3D MOFs, carbon spherical nanomaterials, and other 3D nanomaterials confining non-precious-metal single atomic sites.

2.3.1 NPM-SACs derived from 3D metal–organic-frameworks. 
Metal–organic-frameworks (MOFs), composed of metal ions and organic ligands by strong coordination bonds, have attracted tremendous attention for energy conversion reactions. They exhibit intrinsic properties including a large surface area, large pore volume, uniform pore distribution, and tenable chemical structure, contributing to superior performance in both the ORR and OER.79,80 Not only can they directly act as templates for supporting metal composites,81 but also be used as the precursor of carbon skeletons via a high-temperature carbonization process. Since MOF-5 was first used as the template for synthesizing porous carbon with a high surface area (217 m2 g−1) in 2008, lots of research efforts have been made in developing MOFs as electrocatalytic catalysts.82 A Zn-based MOF, in particular, is a prevalent substrate for NPM-SACs. The addition of Zn helps to prevent aggregation during a high-temperature pyrolysis process through lowering the metal atom concentration and thus increasing the adjacent distance between target metal atoms. In terms of this aspect, ZIF-8 (zeolite imidazolate frameworks), a sub-class of MOFs constructed with Zn cations as metal nods, becomes an ideal platform to anchor NPM-SAs through a high-temperature pyrolysis process.83
During the fabrication process of NPM-SAs confined on 3D materials, two main functions of MOFs could be concluded: (1) the sources of carbon/nitrogen/metal, and (2) (in)direct template for supporting the single atoms. Dilpazir et al. mixed ZIF-67 with central cobalt metal and dicyandiamide (DCD) as precursors and then ZIF-67@DCD went through a carbonization period at 750 °C (Fig. 5a).84 The convoluted cobalt-atom-decorated carbon nanotubes (CoSAs@CNTs) showed a bamboo-like morphology where the metallic cobalt nanoparticles were embedded in each tip of CNTs, and the Co single atoms were homogeneously well dispersed throughout the network of nanotubes. The ZIF here only served as an atom provider (C/N/Co) and the formation of CNTs was depended on the self-reactions of DCD with the involvement of Co atoms which was mentioned before.

3D MOF materials have mainly been used for providing a carbon skeleton for single atoms.85–90 As shown in Fig. 5b, Chen et al. developed a cage encapsulated-precursor pyrolysis strategy to construct an electrocatalyst with isolated Fe atoms anchored into N-doped porous carbon (ISA Fe/CN).91 Considering the fact that the cavity diameter (dc) of ZIF-8 is 11.6 Å and the pore diameter (dp) is 3.4 Å and the molecular diameter of Fe(acac)3 is 9.7 Å, it would be feasible to encapsulated separated Fe(acac)3 molecules in cages. During the further pyrolysis process, ZIF-8 transformed into nitrogen-doped porous carbon, while Fe(acac)3 was reduced to single iron atoms due to the carbonization of organic links. This research provided new methods of confining NPM-SAs into MOF skeletons via a cage-encapsulated-precursor strategy. On the basis of single metal confined SACs, the dual-metal-sites of NPM-SACs were particularly derived from 3D MOF supports recently.92 As shown in Fig. 5c, Wang and co-workers employed a host–guest strategy to form Fe–Co dual sites embedded on N-doped porous carbon ((Fe, Co)/N–C).93 A type of Zn/Co bimetallic MOF was used as a host to immobilize FeCl3 molecules in the cavities and then the Fe moieties were reduced by as-generated carbon and bonded with neighbouring Co atoms. The final (Fe, Co)/N–C retained the polyhedral morphology of the pristine MOF material with more mesopores and Fe and Co atoms were situated homogeneously, indicating the existence of Fe and Co dual sites in the architecture.


2.3.2 NPM-SAs confined on 3D carbon spherical nanomaterials. 
The successful application of monodisperse colloidal spheres in the electrocatalysis field strongly relies on the availability, tightly controlled sizes, surface properties, and self-assembling ability to form ordered superstructures.94 Most carbon sphere-like supports show a unique seedless-shell structure, resulting in the high efficiency of mass transfer based on the reduced diffusion lengths and resistance to aggregation.95 Two general formation categories of non-precious-metal single atoms supported on carbon spheres have been speculated: hard-template52,96,97 and template-free methods.98–100 To produce a spherical structure, SiO2 was often chosen as the hard template and finally removed through acid52,97 or alkaline etching.96 As demonstrated in Fig. 6a, metal sources herein were dissolved in DMF containing organic carbon sources to produce a composite, followed by a carbonization and alkaline etching process to form porous N-doped carbon nanospheres confining isolated single atomic sites (ISAS).96 In contrast to the hard-template synthesis process, the template-free method seems to be more facile and more likely to be conducted for large-scale fabrication. Based on an extended Stober method, monodisperse spheres with uniform and controllable particle size on the sub-micrometer scale can be prepared and these polymeric spheres can be transformed into carbon spheres via a facile carbonization process.101 For example, Han and co-workers synthesized metal isolated-single atomic-site (ISAS) catalysts supported by porous nitrogen-doped carbon nanospheres (M-ISAS/p-CN, M = Co, Ni, Cu, Mn, Pd, etc.) where the dopamine here served as the carbon sphere precursor (Fig. 6b).99 Dopamine has its pristine advantages, such as nontoxicity, sustainability, a high content of carbon and nitrogen atoms, and more importantly, chelating capability with many types of metal ions, which are crucial for generating NPM-SACs.102 Pyrrole can also play a similar role to dopamine in the fabrication process of NPM-SACs. Li et al. synthesized porous carbon woof ball liked nanostructures confining Fe-isolated single atoms (Fe-ISA/SNC) via a facile pyrolysis strategy using pyrrole as one of the precursors.100

2.3.3 Other 3D materials confining non-precious-metal single atoms. 
Apart from the above supports, other 3D materials show opportunities to anchor non-precious-metal single atoms. Zhu et al. developed a facile approach for the first time to simultaneously conduct metal ion homogenous doping and the formation of 3D nitrogen-containing nanowires via a one-step hydrothermal process followed by subsequent annealing. Well-defined tellurium nanowires here were used as hard templates in the presence of nitrogen-containing small molecules and inorganic salts (see in Fig. 6c).103 The obtained Fe single atoms and nitrogen co-doped carbon nanotube aerogels (Fe–N–CNTAs) showed a highly porous nanowire 3D network and conspicuous hollow structures with a diameter of 10 nm resulted from the evaporation of Te at the high annealing temperature. Additionally, there are some other unusual 3D structured materials acting as templates for NPM-SACs. For instance, Yan et al. designed low spin-state d0 W6+ single atom doped Ni(OH)2 nanosheets (W–Ni(OH)2) which showed a 3D layered structure.104 Moreover, sustainable biomass with a high concentration of carbon atoms could also serve as a support. Zhang et al. fabricated N-doped hierarchically porous carbon (NHPC) from Porphyra in the presence of a natural Fe source from hemin. After a high-temperature pyrolysis process, the composite transformed into the final Fe single atom confined NHPC (SA-Fe/NHPC).105 It is also found that biomimetic Co(II)–histidine complexes are able to realize reverse oxygenation and deoxygenation in solution. Based on this theory, Wan et al. successfully produced Co SAC coordinated nonplanar catalysts via pyrolysis and acid washing processes with L-histidine, carbon black and Co-inorganic salts as the precursors.106

2.4 NPM-SAs confined on heterogeneous dimensional supports
Apart from the single kinds of supports, several combined composites have been developed to serve as metal-single-atom supports. Most of these SACs exhibit a three-dimensional nanostructure, as a result of complex chemical bonds among different substrates. As shown in Fig. 6d, Chen et al. put forward a novel route combining carbon layers and CNTs as the supports for metal-single atoms.107 The 3D hierarchical network comprised a great number of carbon layers grown in situ on entangled CNT clusters. Additionally, the 3D carbon structure was co-decorated with N and S as the substrates for Fe–Nx atomic active sites. The resulting S,N–Fe/N/C–CNT hybrid materials exhibited superior bifunctional catalytic activities for both the ORR and OER, as a result of the 3D conductive networks to expedite electron transfer, the unique hierarchical structure, and the abundance of atomically dispersed highly active metal–Nx sites. Wang and co-workers fabricated atomic Fe embedded in a conceptual inter-layer between porous g-C3N4 and N-doped graphene meshes (Fe–NGM/C–Fe).108 The 3D dual-mesh structure resulted from a two-step annealing process with exfoliated graphene and dicyandiamide as the precursors. The obtained complex coordination structure and homogeneous distribution of high density nanopores contributed to excellent electrocatalytic performance in the ORR process.
3. Characterization techniques for identifying active sites in NPM-SACs
Physicochemical characterization offers vital information of NPM-SACs to investigate their electrocatalytic performance and to explain the function of single atoms in the catalyst, providing guidelines for the rational design of NPM-SACs. Currently, the characterization of SACs could be examined by physical, chemical, and advanced computational modelling and related simulation methods such as density functional theory (DFT). High-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HADDF-STEM) has been widely used for finding out the atomic structure of such catalysts. Chemical characterization detection for NPM-SACs is mainly based on synchrotron-radiated X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) techniques, including X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS). DFT provides the binding energy, magnetic moment, and other parameters at the atomic level, which closely correlate with the electrochemical catalytic performance of NPM-SACs.
3.1 Electron microscopy imaging
In the first place, the morphology of materials would be detected by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). However, SEM and TEM can only provide information on the microscopical level. To investigate the atomic structure of NPM-SACs, more precise and high-resolution techniques are required. Compared with conventional TEM, a scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) equipped with additional scanning coils, detectors, and necessary circuity is more effective in measuring compositional changes at buried interfaces as well as the electronic structure and bonding.109 Annular dark field (ADF) imaging using a STEM, which was first conducted by Crewe et al. in 1970, has been further developed to demonstrate single heavy atoms, especially on a thin carbon substrate.110,111 Based on the concept of ADF-STEM, high-angle annular dark-field imaging (HAADF)-STEM could optimize SAC images at the atomic level with the avoidance of structure-sensitive effects compared with conventional high-resolution microscopy.112,113 In recently reported studies, electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) has generally been conducted simultaneously with HADDF-STEM to identify the elemental compositions of materials.114 Considering that light atoms mainly show weak signals in ADF-STEM, modified aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy (AC-STEM) has been developed to observe real space imaging and spectroscopy. More attractively, it can be used to obtain chemical information such as bonding, elemental valence, and dynamics of every single atom.115,116 Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and modified atomic force microscopy (AFM) are capable of realizing the distribution and atomic sites of SACs. Since STM is a kind of surface-science technology, only SACs with a flat structure (2D supports) can be characterized by STM. Non-contact AFM, in particular, could provide a high-resolution three-dimensional surface profile in ambient air or even liquid environments regardless of the sample conductivity, which remedies the defects of common STM.117–120
For instance, nickel SACs stabilized on nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (NiSA–N–CNTs) presented a bamboo-like tubular nanostructure with an average diameter of 20–50 nm, which could be observed in Fig. 7a and b. STEM with elemental mapping in Fig. 7c and d showed a uniform distribution of N and Ni across the tubes.45 In another study reported by Yin et al., the precise structural characterization of NPM-SACs was performed by HADDF-STEM, which implied that the Co single atoms/nitrogen-doped porous carbon (Co SAs/N–C) derived from a MOF retained the initial rhombododecahedral shape of the MOF precursor (Fig. 7e). The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern recorded for an individual molecule demonstrated its poor crystallinity. Magnified HADDF-STEM was performed via aberration-corrected measurements with sub-angstrom resolution and Fig. 7g elucidates the single atomic dispersion of cobalt on the templates. From the EELS mapping image (Fig. 7h), it is discerned that Co and N were homogeneously dispersed within the carbon structure.87

3.2 X-ray spectroscopy
Compared with microscopic technology, spectroscopic methods based on X-rays could provide more accurate characteristic results of elements with a similar atomic weight. Therefore, it is possible to disclose the active sites on the atomic scale as X-rays are quite powerful with short wavelengths (0.01–1 nm). As the most commonly used spectroscopic technique, X-ray diffraction (XRD) has been widely used to confirm the crystalline structure of samples. As shown in Fig. 8a, it is noticeable that there were no obvious differences between ZIF-8 and ZIF-8-supported single-atom catalysts (Fe–N–C).85 Graphitic carbon characteristic peaks could be clearly observed and there were no crystalline Fe species found in the XRD patterns, indicating that either the Fe was atomically dispersed or the Fe content was lower than the detection limit. To further identify the elemental content in NPM-SACs, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was conducted to determine the valence state of the support and dopants. As in Wang et al.'s study, XPS was used to probe the composition of atomic Fe in N-doped graphene nanomeshes coated with a hollow carbon nanoshell (Fe–NGM/C–Fe). However, no significant Fe peaks in Fe–NGM/C–Fe were revealed in XPS results in Fig. 8b, which frequently occurred in NPM-SAC studies.121 Considering the fact that XPS is not sensitive to low-concentration contents, inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) was required. Thus, Fig. 8c shows the more accurate content of Fe in Fe–NGM/C–Fe at 0.53 at%.62

To achieve a higher energy resolution, X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) measurements including extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) and X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) have been performed to further probe the coordination structure of SACs at the atomic level. EXAFS could provide information about the interatomic distances, near-neighbour coordination numbers, and lattice dynamics, while XANES presents information about the valence state, energy bandwidth and bond angle.122 For instance, Han et al. conducted XAFS measurements to analyze isolated Co single atomic sites anchored on N-doped carbon spheres (ISAS-Co/HNCs) under an ambient environment with Co foil, CoO, and Co3O4 as the references. The XANES spectra in Fig. 8d showed that the Co atom valence in ISAS-Co/HNCs was situated between Co0 and Co2+. There were no obvious Co–Co peaks observed in the Fourier transformed (FT) k3-weighted EXAFS spectrum shown in Fig. 8e, which proved that Co atoms were atomically dispersed in ISAS-Co/HNCs without any aggregation. The EXAFS fitting curves (Fig. 8e and f) indicated that the coordination number of the center atom Co was about 4, manifesting that the Co atoms were anchored by four N atoms as the CoN4 active sites in ISAS-Co/HNCs.96
4. Electrocatalytic performance for oxygen redox reactions and applications
Most recently reported NPM-SACs have shown comparable or even better oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), or bifunctional catalytic activities compared with the commercial benchmark (Pt/C, Ir/C, etc.) and other precious-metal-involved catalysts. It is notable that limited NPM-SACs on 1D–3D supports exhibited OER or bifunctional catalytic activities. The most appealing non-precious-metal single atoms participated in these oxygen redox reactions are Fe, Co, and Ni, and there has been a small quantity of research focusing on the Cu, W, or dual-metal sites of the above elements. The atomic metal–nitrogen structure (M–Nx) is the dominant active site for NPM-SACs and limited catalysts directly rely on the metal single atoms in electrochemical reactions which could be only observed in 1D nanomaterials supported NPM-SACs. For high-dimensional substrates (2D and 3D), M–Nx or M–Nx–Cy molecules play significant roles in oxygen redox reactions with the infrequent involvement of other heteroatoms. Unusual dual-metal or multi-metal active sites in NPM-SACs could be observed due to difficult in stabilization without any aggregation, and only a few reported 2D and 3D substrates with a comparably complicated structure allowed this kind of confinement. The addition of other metal-free heteroatoms such as B, S, P, and O has been indicated to influence the metal atom valence state on different substrates and to potentially optimize the ORR and/or OER performance. DFT calculations have been further conducted to understand the reaction pathways, combined with various advanced characterization technologies.
4.1 Oxygen reduction reaction
Generally, the ORR proceeds with the adsorption of oxygen molecules onto the catalyst surface. There are two adsorption types: bidentate O2 adsorption (two O atoms coordinate with the catalyst) and end-on O2 adsorption (one O atom coordinates perpendicularly to the catalyst), which decide the reaction conducts a two-electron and four-electron transfer pathway, respectively.123 The 4e− transfer pathway is preferred in fuel cell and metal–air battery applications, and the 2e− transfer pathway represents a facile and clean method for H2O2 generation. It is still in its initial state for selectively reducing oxygen to H2O2, while recently SACs have presented potential as electrocatalysts in the H2O2 generation process.124–126 For instance, Yang et al. prepared single Pt atoms supported on titanium nitride nanoparticles and the obtained Pt/TiN with a noble-metal content of 0.35% selectively changed the ORR toward a two-electron pathway.126 The high mass activity and selectivity relied on the atomic metal active sites with low loading. In addition, NPM-SACs also demonstrate potential in electrochemical H2O2 generation. Jiang et al. reported that transition metal single-atom coordination motifs (demoted as M–CNT) could act as electrochemical catalysts for reducing oxygen to H2O2 with an unprecedented selectivity of above 95% in both alkaline and neutral media.127 Theoretical analysis also highlighted that transition metal single atoms could efficiently tune the ORR pathways and product selectivity, especially Fe–C–O coordination motifs.
The 4e− transfer pathway is more commonly involved in the existing OER. To visually demonstrate the ORR catalytic activity, the Gibbs free energy (ΔG), defined as the difference between the initial and final states of intermediates, has been regarded as a significant parameter in the ORR process to show the adsorption energies in each step.128 It is widely accepted that the adsorption of O and OH might be the crucial step of the ORR, especially on metal catalysts. In 2004, Nørskov et al. for the first time introduced DFT to calculate the oxygen binding energy of O (ΔEO) and OH (ΔEOH) as the criterion to figure out the ORR catalytic trends for a number of transition metals. Non-precious metals, such as Cu, Ni, and Co, could be observed in Fig. 9a as comparable ORR catalysts to precious metals (e.g., Pt, Rh, and Ag) and the rough linear coordination between ΔEO and ΔEOH had also been indicated in this figure.129 On recently reported NPM-SACs, there are plenty of computational studies conducted, especially on 2D supports. Different kinds of 2D supports such as graphene, pyridinic N-doped graphene, h-boron nitride, silicon carbide, silicon, and borophene showed the possibility to stabilize single metal atoms in single or double vacancies and the theoretically stable SACs could be responsible for catalyzing ORR activities. As summarized in Fig. 9b, Ni@DV-Gr, Pt@DV-Gr, and Rh@NDV-Gr were suggested to be more active than the benchmark Pt (111) in the ORR process.130

For experimental work on different dimensional NPM-SACs, ORR performance has been investigated according to various catalytic properties, including stability, catalytic activity in acidic medium, and methanol tolerance. As shown in Table 1, it is striking that under acidic medium, all of the 1D nanomaterial supported NPM-SACs show comparable ORR catalytic activity and even better stability compared with commercial Pt/C.2,43,50 The excellent structural stability of NPM-SAs confined on 1D supports in acidic solution has also been proven by related DFT calculations.

Different from 1D supports, the summary of NPM-SAs confined on 2D nanomaterials deduced that there have been only a few catalysts that showed comparable ORR electroactivity in acidic electrolytes.131 It is also noticeable that all of the summarized NPM-SACs on 1D supports catalyzed the ORR process based on the M–Nx active sites, while on a 2D graphdiyne substrate, Fe single atoms could directly facilitate the four-electron-transfer ORR pathway with higher selectivity than Pt/C under an alkaline environment.73 Due to the peculiarity of 2D supports, infrequently investigated transition metal single atoms, copper (Cu), have been stably anchored and successfully possessed efficient ORR catalytic activity.67,132 In earlier research conducted by Wu et al. in 2016, highly doped Cu(I)–N active sites within graphene (Cu–N@C) were formed and DFT modeling took Cu coordinated with different numbers of N (Cu–N2, Cu–N3, and Cu–N4) into account. The ORR activity of Cu–N2 embedded on graphene was superior to that of Cu–N3 and Cu–N4 according to theoretical results.132 In 2018, Li et al. fabricated atomic Cu homogenously distributed in 2D ultrathin carbon nanosheets (Cu–N–C) with the recorded highest content of 20 wt% via a facile high-temperature pyrolysis followed by acid etching processes.67 The superior ORR performance of Cu–N–C reflected on the more positive E1/2 (∼31 mV more positive than that of Pt/C), on the no noticeable current loss with the addition of methanol, and on the higher stability in a 10000 s test (Fig. 10a and b). DFT calculation together with high-end characterization technologies has been further performed to figure out the ORR performance of Cu–N–C at the atomic level. The free energy diagrams of the ORR process on Cu–N2 and Cu–N4 molecules are demonstrated in Fig. 11c and d. The upslopes for O2 adsorption in the Cu–N4 model at different overpotentials largely hindered the ORR progress, leading to poor ORR performance.

Compared with low-dimensional supports, there are a larger number of reported studies emphasized on 3D NPM-SACs with excellent ORR activities contributing to the combination of a high-dimensional complex structure and the atomic-scale origin of active sites. In Table 1, the majority of these catalysts consist of Fe or Co atomic active sites in M–Nx–C structures, and few of them comprised bimetal atomic molecules or rarely investigated non-precious metal atoms like Nb133 and W.134 In particular, Wang et al. presented atomic dual-metal sites (Fe–Co) embedded on N-doped porous carbon with a 3D ZIF-8 structure ((Fe, Co)/N–C) as an ORR electrocatalyst, which was fabricated via a facile host–guest strategy. The architectural structure of (Fe, Co)/N–C was deduced by high-resolution characterization technologies, such as HAADF-STEM, XANES, and (E)XAF, together with DFT calculation, and the results indicated the unique metal–metal bonds in (Fe, Co)/N–C as the active dual-metal centers. Especially in an acidic medium, this well-defined (Fe, Co)/N–C exhibited a high ORR activity with an E1/2 of 0.863 V and Eonset of 1.06 V, surpassing commercial Pt/C and most non-precious-metal catalysts. Compared with common single metal centers in M–N–C structures (Fe SAs/N–C and Co SAs/N–C), bimetal active sites more easily cleave the O–O bonds and the two anchoring sites for dissociated O atoms led to a more stable intermediate than single anchoring sites from DFT calculation.93 Similarly, Zhao et al. fabricated Fe and/or Co single atoms confined on 3D hierarchically porous carbon derived from energetic MOFs via an innovative fusion-foaming method very recently. This submillimeter-scaled CoFe@C with dual-metal active sites exhibited better ORR catalytic activity in terms of more positive Eonset and E1/2 and smaller current deterioration in a stability test under both acidic and alkaline media.135
The theoretical detection of active sites in 3D nanomaterial supported NPM-SACs has generally been simplified on a 2D graphene model, as most single atoms are anchored on the (outer) surface of the 3D carbon skeleton with similar properties to 2D carbon supports. Nevertheless, Zhang et al. considered both a single graphene layer and tri-layered 3D graphite structure as the supports of Nb single atoms (Nb-in-C) in the computational analysis.133 The computational results indicated that the Nb + Graphite@V3 (graphite with three missing carbon atoms) model was the most energetically preferred configuration for Nb-in-C and no obvious difference could be observed from the 2D single-layered graphene model (Nb + G@V3) through DFT modelling. Due to the complexity of 3D substrates, there are various possible single-atom active sites in NPM-SACs. Yang et al. reported a facile and versatile gas-transport strategy to synthesize an isolated single-atom copper site (Cu ISAS/NC) catalyst at gram levels. The as-prepared materials retained the initial rhombododecahedral morphology and Cu and N were uniformly distributed on the carbon support surface (Fig. 11a).136 Cu ISAS/NC exhibited superior ORR catalytic activities with a more positive half-wave potential (0.92 V vs. RHE) and much higher kinetic current density (8.87 mA cm−2) than those of Pt/C. DFT calculation was conducted to identify the active sites in the catalytic process. There were three possible confinement structures, namely Cu–N3, Cu–N3–C, and Cu–N3–V, where V referred to the vacancies on the supports. The free energy diagram and corresponding charge density difference (Fig. 11e and f) exhibited a dramatic decrease of theoretical overpotential on the Cu–N3–V model compared with the other two models, indicating the significant role of defects in the ORR catalysts.
4.2 Oxygen evolution reaction
In contrast to the ORR, studies about NPM-SACs possessing oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity have been rarely reported. The OER mechanisms and pathways are relatively complex as the generation of oxygen molecules should undergo several proton/electron coupled processes which is related to the catalyst intrinsic characteristics.141 Transition metals, especially the earth-abundant first-row transition metals which have higher electronic conductivity, have shown the possibility to accelerate the OER catalytic process.142 It is remarkable that although acidic electrolytes potentially provide much lower ohmic resistance,143 recently reported NPM-SACs with different dimensions profited from the alkaline medium in the OER. As summarized in Table 3, only two studies have been reported recently about 1D nanomaterials anchoring NPM-SACs with superior OER catalytic activity. Ding et al. successfully fabricated a Co single atom confined polymerized ionic liquid (Co-PIL) on multi-walled CNTs having better OER performance than Co-particle involved catalysts. The CNTs not only provided a support for Co SA-PIL but also improved the conductivity of whole catalysts.144 Besides PILs, Liu et al. used g-C3N4 to anchor Ni/Fe atomic sites in the presence of CNTs as a support. The as-designed bimetal single-atom-catalyst exhibited excellent OER activity with a low overpotential (∼326 mV @ 10 mA cm−2).145

Different from the fact that the majority of NPM-SACs serving as ORR electrocatalysts were confined on 3D supports, 2D nanomaterials played a dominant role in NPM-SACs to catalyze the OER process. In 2016, Li et al. first verified the opportunity of using non-precious-metal single atom (Co, Ni, and Cu) confined carbon–nitrogen monolayers (graphitic carbon nitride, g-CN) as OER catalysts. From this computational work, the adsorption energy of intermediates (Eads) calculated via DFT in each step has been summarized in Table 2 with Pt as the reference. Remarkably, Co@CN exhibited an exceptionally low overpotential of 0.16 V, and showed potential to replace Pt-based materials as an ideal non-precious-metal OER catalyst.146 After that, Ling et al. found that 2D β12-boron monolayer supported Ni single atoms (Ni/β12-BN) exhibited remarkable computed OER activity with an overpotential of just 0.4 V.147 More recently, Zhou et al. conducted a theoretical study and expanded specific graphitic carbon nitride to N-doped graphene (Nx, x = 1–4) as a promising 2D support for NPM-SACs (metal: Fe, Co, Ni, and Cu). In an acidic medium, Co single atoms with a higher coordination number (Co–N4) presented a comparable OER performance with a low theoretical overpotential of −0.39 V.148 The opportunity of using Co-involved SACs on pyridine N-doped graphene as ideal OER electrocatalysts was also implied in Chen et al.'s work.149 In alkaline solution, monodisperse atomic transition-metal atoms (M = Fe, Co, Ni) embedded in N-doped graphene lattices as MN4C4 moieties (M–NHGF) catalyzed the OER in the following order: Ni > Fe > Co from Fei et al.'s research. They also presented the difference of the OER pathway between Ni and Fe/Co confined NHGF. The OER conducted on Ni-NHGF followed a dual-site pathway where the Ni single atoms and C sites were both favorable for intermediate adsorption. On the basis of DFT calculations, Fei et al. further conducted a proof-of-concept study and the experimental electrochemical measurements coincided well with the computational results. Ni-NHGF catalyzed the OER with an overpotential @ 10 mA cm−2 of 331 mV, quite lower than that of Fe- and Co-NHGF as well as other published Ni nanoparticle involved catalysts.60 According to the above theoretical studies, Ni-single-atom confined 2D nanomaterials have become promising OER electrocatalysts to replace precious-metal-based materials. Various experiments recently have successfully fabricated Ni-single-atom confined 2D materials with comparable OER catalytic performance.58,65,72 In addition to the single metal involved Ni-SACs, the coupling effect of bimetal single atoms confined in 2D nanomaterials has also been investigated by Zhao et al.150 and Wurster et al.,151 using NiCo and FeCo supported on a 2D metal–organic structure, respectively. Compared with the catalysts based on a single type of metal, the dual-sites in NPM-SACs commendably improved the OER performance. For example, NiCo confined ultrathin MOF nanosheets (NiCo-UMOFNs) in Zhao et al.'s study exhibited higher OER activity with an overpotential of 250 mV at 10 mA cm−2 in an alkaline medium, where the value was much smaller than that of Ni-UMOFNs (321 mV) and Co-UMOFNs (371 mV).
For 3D nanomaterial supported NPM-SACs, there are two unusual methods used in the synthesis strategy. For example, Yan et al. formed a single atom W6+ doped Ni(OH)2 nanosheet sample (W–Ni(OH)2) via the alcohothermal method together with a long ultrasonic exfoliation period. The obtained W–Ni(OH)2 possessed an outstanding OER performance with an overpotential of 237 mV @ 10 mA cm−2 in an alkaline medium.104 Dou et al. formed CoOx-ZIF by the on-site oxidation of single Co sites in the ZIF-67 structure through highly efficient O2 plasma technology. The as-prepared CoOx-ZIF partially retained the dodecahedral morphology with the addition of pores at the surface of pristine ZIF-67. The specific activity of CoOx-ZIF was 12 times higher than that of pristine ZIF-67, with 0.0434 mA cmBET−2 at 1.6 V. The high faradaic efficiency (92%) calculated from a RRDE test confirmed that the detected oxidation current was mainly attributed to the OER process, implying its superior OER catalytic activity as well.152
4.3 Bifunctional catalysts and applications
It is well known that oxygen redox reactions are the heart of electrochemical energy conversion, such as in fuel cells and metal–air batteries. Particularly for rechargeable metal–air batteries, it is urgent to explore highly efficient catalysts possessing bifunctional electrocatalytic activities.123 The difficulty of catalyzing reversible reactions by one catalyst hampered the design process of NPM-SACs. In 2017, Chen et al. first fabricated Fe–Nx atomically dispersed N, S co-doped hierarchical carbon layers (S, N–Fe/N/C–CNT) as a bifunctional single-atom-catalyst with highly electrocatalytic performance. The rechargeable Zn–air battery comprising this catalyst also showed an excellent power density of 102.7 mW cm−2 and superior stability.107 To date, various NPM-SACs have been developed and shown the potential to simultaneously accelerate sluggish ORR/OER kinetic processes, especially those confined in a high-dimensional (2D and 3D) support. As summarized in Table 4, the vast majority of bifunctional NPM-SAC applications could be observed in liquid rechargeable Zn–air batteries and few in all-solid Zn–air batteries.154,155

For one-dimensional supports anchoring NPM-SACs, Zheng et al. developed molecule-level Co-doped graphitic carbon nitride (Co–C3N4) on CNT supports (Co–C3N4/CNT) as a comparable bifunctional electrocatalyst in alkaline media.156 This hybrid material maintained the structure of 1D CNT supports and the atomic Co sites were stabilized in the g-C3N4 matrix which were enveloped on the surface of CNTs (Fig. 12a and b). Its superior ORR and OER catalytic activities could be observed in Fig. 12c and d. Co–C3N4/CNT exhibited the lowest onset potential (0.9 V) for the ORR and the lowest potential (1.61 V) to deliver 10 mA cm−2 in the OER process compared with untreated CoOx–C3N4/CNT, metal-free C3N4/CNT, and Co–N/C/CNT with the deposition of Co–N2 moieties. The stability of Co–C3N4/CNT was also superior, indicating the significant role of uncoordinated Co species in ORR ad OER pathways. Zheng et al. further studied the M–C3N4 (M: Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, and Zn) model via a computational methodology. Atomic Fe-, Co-, Ni-C3N4 molecules with theoretical structural stabilities had been analyzed as bifunctional catalysts. The dual volcano plot (Fig. 12e) predicted that non-precious M–C3N4 could act as a substitute for precious-metal-involved bifunctional catalysts. It is noticeable that the DFT calculation indicated the existence of a performance ceiling phenomenon and the best reversible catalyst was neither the best ORR nor the best OER catalyst, which established a novel design principle for bifunctional NPM-SACs.

Moving to high-dimensional supports confining NPM-SACs, more than half of the research had been conducted on 2D supports. Considering the difficulty of catalyzing two reversible reactions at the same time, a more complex design containing different kinds of active sites seems to be more feasible. For example, Tang and co-workers applied a tri-doped pattern in their study. The as-fabricated Co/N/O tri-decorated graphene (NGM-Co) exhibited comparable ORR and OER catalytic activities which were attributed to the highly active sites (Co–Nx–C) as well as the hierarchical porous scaffolds.154 Similarly, Guo et al. introduced boron into Co–N–C atomic molecules anchored in hierarchical porous carbon sheets (Co–N, B–CSs). This tri-doped scheme accelerated reaction kinetics in the 4e− processed ORR and OER. From DFT computation results, the introduction of B could favour the adsorption of oxygen species, further contributing to the outstanding activity and high stability for oxygen redox reactions with the presence of highly active atomic Co–Nx–C sites.155 In addition, bimetal integrated NPM-SACs, especially dual-sites among Fe, Co, and Ni, also attracted increasing attention in this field. For example, Li et al. utilized two types of templates, active salts, and silica nanoparticles, to fabricate 2D meso/microporous Fe/Co–Nx-doped carbon nanosheets (FeCo–Nx–CN). Compared with single-metal doped Nx–CN, mesoporous FeCo–Nx–CN and other recently reported state-of-the-art catalysts, the meso/microporous FeCo–Nx–CN showed the lowest potential gap (ΔE = Ej = 10 − Ehalf-wave) of 0.78 V vs. RHE (Fig. 13a). Liquid Zn–air batteries equipped with FeCo–Nx–CN as the cathode catalyst exhibited the excellent open-circuit voltage (1.4 V, in Fig. 13b) and power density performance (150 mW cm−2, in Fig. 13d), which was three times higher than that of Pt/C. The Zn–air battery rechargeability was impressively stable at different current densities in a long-term cycling test for 44 h. The meso/microporous structure as well as the bimetal single-atom sites made this material very promising as an efficient oxygen electrode in next-generation rechargeable liquid Zn–air batteries.157

Besides the experimental studies, Zhang et al. investigated atomic Co and N co-doped graphene systems (CoNx-gra, x = 1, 2, 3, 4) as reversible electrocatalysts by means of DFT modelling. The superior ORR and OER performance of CoN4-gra has been predicted with a calculated overpotential of 0.69 and 0.47 eV for the OER and ORR in acidic media, respectively.158 He et al. further expanded the range to 11 kinds of transition-metal single-atoms anchored on a 2D graphdiyne (GDY) monolayer. Computational analysis deduced that single atoms preferred the corner of the acetylenic ring and among these stable SACs, Ni@GDY showed the theoretical lowest overpotential of 0.29 and 0.4 V for the ORR and OER in acidic media, respectively.159 This theoretical work opened a new avenue to developing bifunctional NPM-SACs to some extent.
5. Conclusion and prospects
In order to maximize the utilization of active sites of metal catalysts, single-metal-atom catalysts were developed coinciding with the rational design of more active sites at the atomic level. Non-precious-metal single-atom materials represent a new class of low-cost, highly efficient electrocatalysts for ORR and/or OER processes, and exhibit the great potential to replace precious-metal-based catalysts. In this review, we first compare recently reported NPM-SACs from the viewpoint of different dimensional supports. In particular, NPM-SAs confined on 3D nanomaterials have been extensively developed, especially those derived from 3D MOF frameworks. There has also been great interest in the experimental and theoretical investigation of 2D NPM-SACs. However, oriented NPM-SACs for OER and ORR/OER reverse reactions are inferior and need dramatic development. Clean energy storage and conversion applications, such as fuel cells and metal–air batteries based on NPM-SACs, are still in the initial state.
Although the progress of NPM-SACs is impressive, many challenges and opportunities remain. The vast majority of as-prepared NPM-SACs are Fe-, Co-, and Ni-based materials, and these single atoms are mainly first anchored by non-metal heteroatoms such as N, S, B, and O through covalent or coordination bonds, and then the metal matrix is bound to various supports, especially to carbon-based supports. The difficulty of anchoring single metal atoms on supports narrows the range of NPM-SAs as well as supports. As a result, although co-doping or tri-doping of different metal atoms has allowed NPM-SACs to act as bifunctional and even multi-functional electrocatalysts, almost all of the reported NPM-SACs contained only one type of metal atom. Therefore, there is an urgent demand to expand the range of NPM-SAs and to develop various feasible supports. In addition, the loading of active metal sites in NPM-SACs is generally minimal due to the intrinsic restrict of NPM-SACs. Most atomic content is lower than 1%, which limits the increase of active sites and thus the electrocatalytic performance. Defects or vacancies on supports could provide probable sites for single atoms and reduce aggregation as well. As reported by Zhang et al., pre-treated graphene with defects successfully trapped Ni single atoms and exhibited excellent performance in the HER and OER.58 In the future, more research attention should be paid to enhance the stability of supports and break the trade-off between atom loading and agglomeration. Moreover, the performance of NPM-SACs is normally unpredicted due to the random anchoring location of single metal atoms. Developing an effective strategy to manipulate and control the growth of certain metal single atoms on selective supports can be significantly meaningful.
Exploring universal and facile high-resolution techniques is a continuous mission to precisely identify the active sites in NPM-SACs. Although the development of ex situ characterization techniques, such as HAADF-STEM and XAFS, could enable some identification of single atoms, techniques for effective in situ detection of single-atom active sites during reaction pathways are still in their infancy, and are essential to obtain a mechanistic understanding of electrocatalysis on NPM-SACs. A poisoning test with a specific molecular probe is also an imperative method for unequivocally revealing the role of the metal in electrochemical catalysis. A particular design of control experiments could identify the significance of single atoms as well as distinguish the difference between NPM-SACs and traditional non-precious-metal catalysts.
There is no doubt that modelling technologies are significant in the design and electrocatalytic activity analysis parts. Most electrochemical performance simulations of NPM-SACs supported on carbon-based materials have been built on 2D-graphene models via DFT calculations. The difference among 1D, 2D, and 3D supports is usually ignored to simplify the calculation process, while more specific computational work is needed to fully realize the roles of individual metal atoms, different-dimensional supports, and the interactions between them at the atomic level. Although previous studies have investigated bimetal catalysts, the mechanism of the confinement of different metal atoms on the same supports is not clear. The interaction of bi- and even tri-metal active sites and the electrochemical reaction mechanism on them need to be specifically investigated to accelerate the development progress of complex NPM-SACs. It is well known that the computational technique is a powerful tool and the proof-of-concept pattern could verify the feasibility of synthesis and provide the trends in catalyst optimization. The rational design of different functional NPM-SACs would be possible on the basis of more advanced modelling technologies.
The application of NPM-SACs for ORR and/or OER catalytic reactions is in its infancy. Especially for bifunctional NPM-SACs, liquid Zn–air batteries seem to be the most popular applications recently. All-solid metal–air batteries and new kinds of fuel cells like high-temperature membrane fuel cells could be taken into account. Considering the commercialization possibility, metal–air batteries in acidic medium seem to be more efficient than in alkaline electrolytes. The performance of most NPM-SACs is barely satisfactory in acidic media, and thus more effort is needed. The economic cost and the environmental effects of NPM-SACs are nonnegligible factors in the applications of NPM-SACs as well. To this end, the future of NPM-SACs will be bright in the electrochemical energy technology field. Taking advantage of advanced modelling technologies, high-revolution characterization methods, and novel synthesis strategies, NPM-SACs will undergo rapid development.
