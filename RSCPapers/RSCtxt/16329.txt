    , Accepted 25th April 2018First published on 25th April 2018AbstractEfficient charge separation is a key factor that determines the efficiency of photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting. Here, we introduce controllable vanadium dopants to the ZnO nanorod arrays (NRAs) as a photoanode. The optimal vanadium doping amount exhibited a negative shift in the flatband potential, which was favorable for charge separation, resulting in a maximum applied bias photo-to-current efficiency of 0.8%, which was 2.1 times that of the pristine ZnO photoanode. More importantly, V-doping induced ZnO ferroelectric behavior was adopted to further optimize the PEC performance through the ferroelectric polarization by external electric field poling. The negative bias poling enlarged the band bending at the electrode/electrolyte interface, which facilitated the separation of photogenerated charges and thus resulted in an increased efficiency of 1.04%. This work provides a new method for the design of ferroelectric materials as efficient photoanodes for PEC water splitting.
Introduction
Hydrogen production from photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting has shown great potential for solar energy conversion to meet the steadily increasing energy demand.1–4 PEC performance is extremely sensitive to the interfacial electronic band structure at the electrode/electrolyte interface.5–7 Recently, a ferroelectric material coated on the photoelectrode surface has been widely explored for PEC water splitting, as ferroelectric polarization switched on by an external electric field has been proven to engineer the interfacial band structure at the electrode/electrolyte interface to facilitate the charge separation for water splitting.8,9 Cui et al. integrated a ferroelectric P (VDF-TrFE) layer with Si and tuned the Schottky barrier between Si and the electrolyte by manipulating the poling direction of the ferroelectric domains.10 After forward poling, the photovoltage of the electrode increased by 17%, which significantly boosted the current density at 1.23 V versus A reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) by about 110%. Yang et al. reported TiO2/BaTiO3 core/shell nanowires (NWs) as a photoanode for water splitting.11 When compared to pristine TiO2 NWs, the 5 nm BTO-coated TiO2 NWs achieved a 67% photocurrent density enhancement due to the increased charge separation efficiency induced by the ferroelectric polarization of the BTO shell. Wu et al.12 reported TiO2–SrTiO3 core–shell NWs as a photoanode for water splitting, which achieved an 83% photocurrent density enhancement and a 79% separation efficiency enhancement compared with pristine TiO2 NWs. However, the low carrier mobility of typical ferroelectric materials could suppress the charge transport at the electrode/electrolyte interface. Therefore it is urgent to find a new ferroelectric material for PEC water splitting.
Doping with metal/non-metal elements is often an efficacious way to engineer electrical structures to improve PEC performance.13–17 For example, Wang et al. reported N doped ZnO nanorod arrays (NRAs) as photoanodes for PEC water splitting, and the maximum photocurrent density was about 2 orders of magnitudes higher than that of pristine ZnO NRAs.18 N gradient-doped ZnO NRAs can not only utilize the visible light irradiation, but can also efficiently drive photo-induced electron and hole transfer via the terraced band structure. Among various doped materials, vanadium doping not only changed the electrical and optical properties of ZnO, but also changed its ferroelectric properties.19,20 Kumar et al. reported a reduction in the optical band gap of ZnO with V doping, and the ferroelectric properties changed with an increase in the sintering temperature.21 Sarica et al. demonstrated that the electrical resistivity of the ZnO films decreased sharply as a consequence of V doping and showed intrinsic ferromagnetic behavior at room temperature.22 In addition, ZnO is a popular candidate as a photoanode for PEC water splitting, due to its 10–100 times higher electron mobility in comparison to TiO2.23–28 However, systematic reports about these properties of V-doped ZnO to optimize PEC water splitting performance are still rare.
In this paper, we elevated the PEC performance of a ZnO NRAs photoanode by V doping during the hydrothermal process. The optimal doping amount resulted in a highest applied bias photo-to-current efficiency of 0.8%, 2.1 times that of a pure ZnO NRAs photoanode. Moreover, the positive poling induced upward band bending at the interface and thus facilitated the separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs, resulting in an increased efficiency of 1.04%.
Experimental
Fabrication of the V doped ZnO nanorods array
ZnO NRAs were grown on F-doped SnO2 (FTO) substrates via a hydrothermal method as described by previous works.21,22 The colloidal seed solution of zinc acetate [Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O] (0.5 M) was spin-coated onto the FTO substrate, and then annealed at 350 °C in air for 30 min. The ZnO NRAs were prepared by the hydrothermal process in an aqueous solution containing 50 mM zinc nitrate hexahydrate [Zn(NO3)2·6H2O] and hexamethylenetetramine (HMTA) [(CH2)6N4] at 90 °C for 4 h. Finally, the substrate containing the products was repeatedly rinsed with deionized water several times and annealed in air at 450 °C for 3 h to remove the residual surface salts. V doped ZnO NRAs were synthesized using a similar approach with the added impurity of 1 ml, 2 ml and 4 ml 1 mM vanadium pentoxide (V2O5) solution, respectively. The corresponding prepared samples were labelled as ZnO/V-1, ZnO/V-2 and ZnO/V-4.
Characterization of materials
The structures and morphologies of the electrode materials were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) (Rigaku DMAX-RB, Cu Kα) and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) (FEI QUANTA 3D). The elemental content of the samples was determined by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). The formation of V-doped ZnO nanorods and the species bonding characteristics were investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (ESCALAB 250).
Electrochemical characterization
The photoanode was fabricated by securing a copper wire on the exposed electrically conductive parts of the FTO with a silver conducting paint. The substrate was subsequently sealed on all edges with epoxy resin, except for the active working area (1 × 1 cm2). All electrochemical measurements were performed in a three electrode mode with a photoanode as the working electrode, a coiled Pt wire as the counter electrode and an Ag/AgCl reference electrode. 0.5 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution (with pH buffered to ∼7.0) was adopted as the electrolyte. Electrochemical measurements were performed on an electrochemical workstation (Solartron SI 1287/SI 1260). For the poling experiments, before the PEC test, the V-doped ZnO NRAs were poled by +2 V or −1.2 V for 20 min in 0.5 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution using Pt wire as the counter electrode. All photoanodes were illuminated from the front side under AM 1.5G illumination provided by a solar simulator (Oriel, 91159A). The white light intensity was 60 mW cm−2 and was measured using a Si diode (Newport). The applied bias photo-to-current efficiency was calculated from the Jph–V curves, assuming 100% faradaic efficiency and using the following equation:η = I(1.23 − Vapp)/PlightVapp is the applied external potential versus the reversible electrode (RHE). I is the externally measured current density at Vapp. Plight is the power density of the incident light. The potentials were measured versus the Ag/AgCl reference electrode and converted to the RHE scale using the Nernst function:  ERHE is the converted potential versus the RHE. EAg/AgCl is the external potential measured against the Ag/AgCl reference electrode, and  is the standard electrode potential of the Ag/AgCl reference electrode (0.1976 V versus RHE at 25 °C).
Results and discussion
In the hydrothermal process, pure ZnO NRAs were grown vertically on the FTO substrate with diameters of ∼100 nm and a length of ∼3 μm, as shown in Fig. 1a. After V doping, the doped ZnO NRAs exhibited fairly uniform sizes (∼3 μm in length, and about ∼100 nm in diameter) as shown in Fig. 1b–d, which were very similar to the typical undoped ZnO NRAs grown under the same concentration. This result means that the V doping process did not destroy the morphology of the ZnO NRAs compared to that of pure ZnO NRAs. However, the surface of the V doped ZnO NRAs became rough (Fig. 1e) with some small pits observed at the nanorod surface, which were ascribed to the corrosive effect of the acid vanadium pentoxide solution. The electron loss spectroscopy (EELS) elemental mapping under scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) elemental mapping in the STEM mode (Fig. 1e) revealed the spatial element distributions of Zn, O and V, which were uniformly distributed along the entire nanorod (Fig. 1f–h). The compositions of the as-prepared photoanodes were further examined by EDX measurements and their atomic ratios were calculated from the EDX spectra, as shown in Fig. S1 in the ESI.†

In order to study the chemical states of Zn, O and V in the V doped ZnO NRAs, systematic XPS analysis was performed. From the wide scan in Fig. S2 in the ESI,† the XPS peaks belonging to Zn, O and V can be observed, confirming the existence of V in ZnO after the hydrothermal process. The Zn 2p spectrum in Fig. 2a displayed the binding energies of Zn 2p3/2 and Zn 2p1/2 at 1021.5 eV and 1044.7 eV, confirming the formation of ZnO. The highly-resolved XPS spectrum in Fig. 2b shows the peaks at the binding energies of 516.95 and 524.05 eV assigned to V5+, which was incorporated into the crystal lattice of ZnO.20,29

Fig. 2c displays the UV-Vis spectra of pure and V-doped ZnO NRAs. Pure ZnO NRAs showed optical absorption only in the UV region. After V doping, the optical absorption edges of the V doped ZnO NRAs showed a slight red shift attributed to the successful V ions being doped into the ZnO. As a direct-gap semiconductor, the optical band gap of pure and V-doped ZnO NRAs were estimated by the Tauc equation:(ahν)2 = A(hυ − Eg)where α is the absorption coefficient of the material. The results were consistent with the theoretical calculation, as shown in Fig. S3 and S4 in the ESI.†
To further study the effects of V ion doping on the optical properties of ZnO NRAs, the room temperature photoluminescence (PL) spectra were investigated. As shown in Fig. 2e, the emission at about 590 nm corresponded to the intrinsic defects related energy. The relative intensity of the deep level (DL) emission can serve as an indicator for evaluating the electron–hole recombination. When the V doping amount was no more than 2 mL, the incorporation of V suppressed the intrinsic defects, which decreased the broad DL emission, as shown in Fig. 2f. When the nanorods were doped with excess V atoms, the defects adjacent to the V dopant increased, which increased the probability of the radiative recombination related to DL emission.30
The PEC performance of pure ZnO and V doped ZnO NRAs with different dopant amounts were characterized through photoinduced I–V curves under dark and illumination. As can be seen in Fig. 3a, the different photoanodes all exhibited a very small background current density from −0.4 to 1.4 V (vs. RHE) in the scale of 10−3 mA cm−2. Compared with pure ZnO NRAs, the photocurrent densities of the V doped ZnO NRAs were considerably improved. As the doping amount increased from 1 mL (ZnO/V-1) to 2 mL (ZnO/V-2), the photocurrent density increased to about 1.88 mA cm−2 for ZnO/V-2 at 1.23 V versus RHE, mainly due to the decreased charge recombination and enhanced charge separation. The increased photocurrent density gave rise to a maximum applied bias photo-to-current efficiency (ABPE) of 0.83% at a low bias of 0.75 V versus RHE, which was about a 120% improvement compared to the pure ZnO NRAs photoanode (0.38% at 0.78 V vs. RHE), as shown in Fig. 3b. Further increasing the doping amount to 4 mL resulted in a decrease in the photocurrent density and the ABPE, as observed for ZnO/V-4, which could be ascribed to the high charge recombination as more defects were introduced by excess ion doping.

A photocurrent transient measurement was performed to assess whether the doping of V could suppress the charge recombination rate, as shown in Fig. 3c. To quantitatively determine the charge recombination behavior, a normalized parameter (D) is introduced:  
In which It, Ist and Iin are the time-dependent, steady-state and initial photocurrent, respectively, as shown in Fig. 4d.31,32 The transient time constant (τ) is defined as the time when lnD = −1 in the normalized plots of lnD–t (Fig. 3e), which reflects the general behavior of charge recombination and life-time of the charge carriers. τ was estimated to be 14.48 s for the ZnO/V-2 under simulated solar light, which was 4.5 times that of the pure ZnO (3.22 s), indicating the suppressed charge recombination.

To understand the intrinsic electronic properties of the ZnO NRAs doped with V ions, electrochemical impedance measurements were performed in the dark coupled with Mott–Schottky (MS) analysis in an electrolyte solution (0.5 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution). The carrier concentration and flat band potential at the interface can be calculated using the equations shown below:    
In which C is the capacitance between ZnO and the electrolyte, ε is the dielectric constant of ZnO, ε0 is the permittivity of a vacuum, e is the electron charge, Nd is the dopant concentration, E is the applied potential, EFB is the flat band potential, κ is the Boltzmann constant and T is the absolute temperature. From the known dielectric constant of ZnO (ε = 10) and the permittivity of a vacuum (ε0 = 8.85 × 1014 F cm−1), the carrier densities were calculated to be 3.54 × 1017, 7.54 × 1017, 2.38 × 1018 and 2.06 × 1018 cm−3, for pure ZnO, ZnO/V-1, ZnO/V-2 and ZnO/V-4, respectively. The flat band potentials of the different photoanodes were obtained by extrapolating 1/C2 to zero as shown in Fig. 3d. As shown in Fig. S6 in the ESI,† the Schottky barrier height is determined by the potential difference between the flat band potential and the oxygen evolution potential. Therefore, the negative flat band potential magnified the barrier height and resulted in an enhancement of the charge separation of the photoinduced electron–hole pairs. Obviously, the EFB of the ZnO/V-2 photoanode was more negative than that of other photoanodes, which was favorable for charge separation, resulting in a highly saturated photocurrent density in line with the LSV curve shown in Fig. 3a.
As shown in Fig. 4a, the V-doped ZnO NRAs exhibited a clear hysteresis Polarization–electric field (P–E) loop characteristic of ferroelectric materials with a saturation polarization (Ps) of ≈0.022 μC cm−2, a remnant polarization (Pr) of ≈0.016 μC cm−2, and a coercive field (Ec) of ≈44 kV mm−1, evidencing the appreciable ferroelectricity of the as prepared V-doped ZnO NRAs. As can be seen in Fig. S5 in the ESI,† no hysteresis was observed in the P–E curve of pure ZnO. Therefore, the P–E hysteresis in the V-doped ZnO is attributed to the introduction of V dopants. The ferroelectric V-doped ZnO NRAs can be poled by an external electric bias, leading to remnant aligned dipoles. These dipole alignments would produce large internal electric fields, which could result in a tunable performance of the photoanode. The negatively poled photoanode exhibited a negative shift of the onset potential compared to the control photoanode. On the contrary, for the positively poled photoanode that showed a positive bias poling, the onset potential positively shifted compared with the control electrode. Moreover, the saturated photocurrent density slightly increased from 1.72 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V versus RHE for the control electrode to 1.97 mA cm−2 for the negative bias poled photoanode, while the saturated photocurrent density decreased to 1.23 mA cm−2 for the positive bias poled photoanode, as shown in Fig. 4b. Accordingly, the maximum ABPE after negative bias poling increased to 1.04% at 0.73 V versus RHE, while the maximum ABPE after positive bias poling decreased to 0.73% at 0.79 V versus RHE, as shown in Fig. 4c. However, the performance of pure ZnO showed no change after positive or negative bias poling. The enhanced performance was ascribed to the improvement of the separation of the photogenerated electron–hole pairs with negative poling, and the positive poling led to the decrease of separation of the photogenerated electron–hole pairs.
Nyquist plots of the ZnO/V-2 with different polarization directions are described in Fig. 4d. The arc diameter reduction in the Nyquist plots indicates efficient charge transfer at the electrode/electrolyte interface. The arc diameter decreased as the negative bias poled, while the arc diameter increased as the positive bias poled. Thus, the negative bias poling accelerated the charge transfer at the interface, indicating a higher photocurrent compared to positive bias poling.
The variation of charge separation could be demonstrated by the change of band bending. After the negative bias poling, negative ferroelectric charges accumulated at the electrode/electrolyte interface, raising the band bending as shown in Fig. 4e, which was favorable for the charge separation. When the photoanode was poled by the positive bias, positive ferroelectric charges appeared at the interface resulting in a reduced band bending and suppressing the charge separation, as shown in Fig. 4f.
Conclusions
In summary, we successfully prepared V-doped ZnO NRAs as a photoanode, which significantly improved the PEC performance. With optimization of the dopant amount, the maximum applied bias photo-to-current efficiency reached 0.83% at 0.75 V versus RHE, which was 2.1 times that of the pristine ZnO photoanode. Furthermore, the negative bias poling amplified the band bending at the electrode/electrolyte and enhanced the charge separation, eventually resulting in a negative shift of the onset potential and an increased efficiency of 1.04%. As a whole, this work provides a promising avenue to optimize novel photoanodes for PEC water splitting.
