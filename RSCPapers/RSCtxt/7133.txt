    , Accepted 7th October 2018First published on 8th October 2018AbstractDesigned with a symmetrical naphthatetrathiophene (NTT) core and triphenylamine (TPA)-based side arms, a series of novel organic small molecule hole-transporting materials are simulated for perovskite solar cells (PSCs) using density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) methods. As a fundamental understanding, the energy level alignments and the charge transport behavior are explored for their potential applications. Our results show that, adding an oxygen-bridge between the neighboring phenyl groups of TPA side arms makes the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels up-shift, whereas the carbon–carbon single bond stabilizes the HOMOs by about 0.3–0.4 eV. By structural tailoring of the TPA side arms, the HOMO levels of newly designed molecules range from −5.08 eV to −5.61 eV, which provides more possibilities for the interfacial energy regulation. Meanwhile, our results also indicate that the quasi-planar molecular architecture and the delocalized frontier molecular orbitals can effectively enhance the electronic coupling between adjacent molecules. In addition, the reorganization energies are distinctly lowered in the cases of the mixed carbon–carbon bond and oxygen-bridge, and the double oxygen-bridge models. As a result, these molecules with the additional carbon–carbon bond and oxygen-bridge exhibit high hole mobilities. Several promising candidates are proposed toward more efficient PSCs, and more importantly, this work offers some new insights for the design of organic small molecule materials.
1. Introduction
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are considered as promising alternatives to conventional silicon-based solar cells due to their comparable efficiency and cost-effectiveness.1–3 In typical PSCs, sunlight is absorbed by the metal halogen perovskite located at the interface between electron- and hole-transporting layers, and then the separated electron and hole are transported to the photoanode and the counter-electrode. As a key component of PSCs, hole-transporting materials (HTMs) are responsible for hole-transporting, charge separation, and the inhibition of charge recombination. To improve the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs, substantial efforts have been devoted to the design and synthesis of highly effective HTMs by regulating molecular energy levels and improving hole mobility.4,5 To date, some cells made of conducting polymers and inorganic semiconductors exhibit excellent performance with respect to cell stability and efficiency.2,6 Meanwhile, organic small molecule materials have also attracted considerable research interest due to the abundance of raw materials, and the flexibility of molecular design.7–9
Triphenylamine (TPA) and related materials have been broadly adopted for the design of organic semiconductors due to their unique nonplanar molecular configuration and the excellent charge transport properties.10 In 2014, Ko et al. reported a series of star-shaped HTMs with fused TPA and TPA as a core unit, respectively; the results show that the new HTMs based on the fused TPA moiety exhibit large short-circuit current density and high hole mobility.11,12 Subsequently, Wakamiya et al. employed an oxygen-bridged TPA as a side arm, and conjugated it with the core unit of azulene to prepare three structurally simple HTMs, achieving an encouraging PCE of 16.5%.13 Particularly, even a minor modification of the TPA donor can also lead to prominent changes in cell performance. In 2016, Johansson et al. reported two molecularly engineered HTMs (X2 and X25), with improved molecular planarity and conductivity; X25 obtained a higher PCE of 17.4%.14 Meanwhile, the sulfur-bridged TPA core was also explored by Grisorio et al., and a remarkable PCE of 17.6% was achieved.15 Theoretically, based on TPA donors, Chi et al. investigated the relationship between the molecular structures and the properties of HTMs by optimizing the length of the thienothiophene chain and the substituted position of methoxyl, and several potential candidates are proposed.16,17 Thus, it is essential to choose appropriate TPA-based donors with matched energy levels and excellent hole-transporting properties for new promising HTMs.
In order to further explore the clues that guide the rational design of organic HTMs and to scrutinize the promising HTMs used in PSCs, in this manuscript, a symmetrical core unit naphthatetrathiophene (NTT) and TPA-based electron donors were investigated. As shown in Fig. 1, the model molecule NTT-4TPA is composed of an NTT core and four TPA side arms, and by replacing the four arms simultaneously, nine new hole-transporting molecules were designed. The segments employed to replace the TPA side arms were labeled as T1–T9, respectively. Among them, two neighboring phenyl groups of the TPA unit were linked with the carbon–carbon single bond (T1 and T2), oxygen-bridge (T3 and T4), oxygen-bridge and carbon–carbon single bond (T5 and T6), and two oxygen-bridges (T7, T8 and T9), respectively. Moreover, the position of the oxygen-bridge and carbon–carbon bond (T1–T6) and the number of methoxy groups (T7–T9) were also regulated. The electronic structures, optical properties, and hole-transporting behavior have been studied for all considered molecules using density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) approaches. We focus our study on the structure–property relationship of the TPA-based molecules in order to provide some clues for experimentalists to design and synthesize new organic HTMs, and through systemic investigations, several potential candidates are proposed toward more efficient PSCs.

2. Computational details
The ground-state geometries of the investigated molecules were optimized using DFT with the hybrid functional B3LYP, coupled with the 6-31G* basis set.18–20 Based on the optimized geometries, UV-vis spectra were obtained by performing single-point TD-DFT calculations with the MPW1K functional and 6-31G* basis set.21 In order to consider the solvent effects, the dichloromethane (DCM) solvent was employed during the ground and excited-state calculations with the C-PCM method.22 Frequency calculations were performed at the same theoretical level as the ground-state optimizations to confirm the nature of the minima. To obtain the vertical emission energies, single-point TD-DFT calculations were implemented based on the optimized excited-state geometries, where the hybrid functional MPW1K and 6-31G* basis set were used.23 All the calculations above were performed with the Gaussian09 program package.24
To describe hole-transporting in HTMs, we employed the thermally activated hopping and diffusion model because the intermolecular electronic couplings are relatively weak in organic semiconductors. Marcus theory with the hopping model is an appropriate choice for the molecular system with a weakly coupling character, and the charge hopping rate (κ) can be expressed as follows:25,26  where Vab is the transfer integral, λ is the reorganization energy, ħ is Planck's constant, kB is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature in Kelvin, respectively.
The reorganization energy, which is defined as the energy change associated with the geometry relaxation during the charge transfer, is evaluated as:27–29λ = λ0 + λ+ = [E0(M+) − E0(M0) + E+(M0) − E+(M+)]where E0 and E+ represent the energy of neutral and cationic states, M0 and M+ represent the optimized geometries of the neutral molecule and cation, respectively. That is, E0(M+) is the single-point energy of the neutral state at the optimized cationic geometry, and E0(M0) is the ground-state energy of the neutral molecule.
The value of the transfer integral shows the strength of electronic coupling between adjacent molecules, and depends on the molecule arrangement in the solid state. To achieve high charge mobility, the reorganization energy and the transfer integral need to be minimized and maximized, respectively. In this work, the transfer integral is calculated with a direct coupling method:30,31Vab = 〈ψ0,aHOMO|F|ψ0,bHOMO〉where ψ0,aHOMO and ψ0,bHOMO are the HOMOs of the two adjacent molecules a and b when no intermolecular interaction is present, and F is the Fock operator. The PW91 exchange and PW91 correlation functionals, coupled with the 6-31G* basis set, are employed. It has been shown that this choice can give the best description of electronic coupling at the DFT level.30,32
The hole mobility (μ) of the investigated systems can be obtained from the Einstein equation,33  where e is the unit charge, and D is the diffusion coefficient, with the formula:  where i is the given transfer pathway, ri is the charge hopping centroid to the centroid distance, d represents the spatial dimensionality and is taken as 1 in this work,34,35 and  is the hopping probability for the ith pathway.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Frontier molecular orbital
Benefiting from the development of DFT and TD-DFT approaches, computational simulations have played an important role in designing new semiconductor materials with appropriate energy levels and high charge mobility. It is well known that the electron-donating capacity of the TPA donor has a remarkable impact on the energy levels and spatial distribution of the highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMOs), which further affects the interfacial charge separation and the following charge transport. Therefore, the TPA donor and nine TPA-based derivatives were selected here as the side arms of hole-transporting molecules, as displayed in Fig. 1, to regulate the molecular energy levels and hole mobility.
Frontier molecular orbitals (FMOs) are normally employed to illustrate the charge transport properties of semiconductor materials because the more delocalized FMOs can promote the faster charge transport by reducing the nuclear reorganization energy and increasing the electronic coupling between adjacent molecules. As shown in Fig. 2, the HOMO of the model NTT-4TPA is almost delocalized over the whole molecular skeleton, which is derived from the π-conjugated core unit NTT and the electron-donating TPA side arms. A similar feature can also be found for the newly designed molecules (T1–T9), and the π-conjugated character is somewhat enhanced for T5, T6, and T7–T8 due to the quasi-planar architecture of the TPA-based side arms. Particularly, the HOMO of T4 is mainly distributed on the terminal groups, which may result from the large twisted dihedral angles between the phenyl and the phenoxthine unit about 80° in the side arms, and adverse for the charge transfer. Meanwhile, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMOs) of the investigated molecules also present a π-conjugated feature, and is mainly distributed on the central NTT unit and the linked phenyl group in the TPA-based side arms.

In order to facilitate the interfacial charge separation and to maximize the open circuit voltage of PSCs, an appropriate energy level alignment between the perovskite and the HTMs is needed. A deeper HOMO level usually indicates a larger open circuit voltage because the voltage value depends on the difference between the quasi-Fermi level of TiO2 and the HOMO level of HTMs. The HOMO values presented in this work are revised using a reliable semi-rational formula.34 As listed in Table 1 and depicted in Fig. 2, the HOMO levels of the designed molecules can be regulated in an energy range from −5.08 eV to −5.61 eV by modifying the terminal structures. Compared with the value of NTT-4TPA (−5.25 eV), the calculated results indicate that inserting the carbon–carbon bond between the neighboring two phenyl groups of TPA side arms can stabilize the HOMO levels by 0.31 eV (T1) and 0.36 eV (T2), respectively. On the other hand, the single oxygen-bridge makes the HOMO levels of T3 and T4 up-shift (0.13 eV and 0.06 eV, respectively). In addition, the para-bridged phenyl groups in T2 and T4 induce more stabilized HOMO levels compared with that of the ortho-bridges (T1 and T3). The mixed carbon–carbon single bond and the oxygen-bridge in T5 and T6 result in middle HOMO levels of −5.35 eV and −5.42 eV, respectively. Using the double oxygen-bridges, the HOMO level of T7 (−5.18 eV) up-shifted, and the levels exhibit an up-shifted trend with an increase of the methoxy groups from T9 (−5.26 eV) to T7, and to T8 (−5.08 eV), respectively. Meanwhile, to further demonstrate the reliability of the calculated HOMO levels, the functional PBE33 and the 6-31G* basis set are also employed. As listed in Table 1 and shown in Fig. S1,† the data with the PBE33/6-31G* method are in good accordance with the data revised by the given formula. The maximum error is 0.05 eV and the mean error is only 0.02 eV. In summary, the widespread HOMO levels of the designed molecules could provide more new choices for interfacial energy regulation.

For promising HTMs, the LUMO level should be higher than the conduction band of perovskite (such as CH3NH3PbI3, −3.93 eV)36 to block the electron–hole recombination between the perovskite and the metal electrode. The LUMO levels are calculated in this work by adding the first singlet excitation energy to the values of the HOMOs.34 As listed in Table 1 and shown in Fig. 2, the LUMOs of the investigated molecules are distributed in the energy range from −3.10 eV to −2.77 eV. Compared with the conduction band edge of CH3NH3PbI3, these LUMOs result in large energy barriers of 0.83–1.16 eV for the designed molecules, suggesting that the undesired electron–hole recombination could be effectively prevented.
On the whole, with emphasis on the energy level alignments and the frontier orbital distributions, the TPA donor was judiciously tailored as the side arms of HTMs. Compared with the calculated HOMO level of spiro-OMeTAD (−5.08 eV, in Table 1), the designed molecules exhibit more stabilized HOMOs, and thus higher open circuit voltages can be expected. As depicted in Fig. 3, the HOMOs of T5, T6, T7, T9, and NTT-4TPA are matched with the valence band of CH3NH3PbI3 (−5.43 eV),36 and the single bond-bridged T1 and T2 are more suitable for the mixed perovskite of (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15 (−5.65 eV)5 with the deeper HOMO levels. It should also be noted that the intrinsic halide segregation of the mixed perovskite may change its surface energy alignment;37 thus, hole-transporting materials with deep energy levels should be selected more carefully.

3.2 Absorption spectrum and the Stokes shift
Besides the matched energy levels, less light absorption in the visible region and the large Stokes shift are also typical features for promising HTMs. To gain more insight into the electronic transition and the optical properties of the designed molecules, the absorption spectra and the vertical emission energies are calculated based on the optimized ground- and first excited-state geometries. The absorption maximum wavelengths (λabs), excitation energies (ΔEEX), oscillator strengths (f), and the vertical emission wavelengths (λem) are listed in Table 1, and the absorption spectra of several selected molecules are displayed in Fig. 4. As listed in Table 1, the calculated maximal absorption of spiro-OMeTAD is found to locate at 346 nm, which is in accordance with the experimental value of 383 nm.38 For the designed molecules, the maximum absorption peaks range from 384 nm to 436 nm, which are shown to be red-shifted by 38–90 nm compared with that of spiro-OMeTAD. The results illustrate that the absorption of all cases takes place outside or close to the visible light region and overlaps slightly with the absorption band of perovskites.
 Fig. 4  Calculated optical absorption spectra of the model NTT-4TPA, and the T2, T5, T6 and T7 molecules. 
As presented in Table 1, the maximum absorption of the designed molecules is mainly composed of the transition from the HOMO to the LUMO due to the large spatial overlap between the frontier molecular orbitals. Particularly, for the absorption of T4, the maximum wavelength of 406 nm is a little blue-shifted compared with that of T3 (424 nm), whereas its energy gap of 2.09 eV is smaller than that of T3 (2.35 eV). The discrepancy between the blue-shifted absorption spectra and the smaller energy gap of T4 is derived from the twisted dihedral angle (80°) of terminal groups, and thus the electronic excitation from the TPA derivative arms to the NTT core is partially suppressed, and the large excitation energy and small oscillator strength are presented (listed in Table 1).
According to the maximum absorption peaks and the vertical emission peaks, the Stokes shifts can be calculated using the formula Δλst = λem − λabs. As depicted in Fig. 5, the maximum emission wavelength of spiro-OMeTAD is located at 396 nm (419 nm for experiment), which corresponds to a Stokes shift of 49 nm. For the designed molecules, the Stokes shifts range from 56 nm to 83 nm (see Table 1), which are distinctly larger than that of spiro-OMeTAD. The large Stokes shifts represent the big structural differences between the ground- and the excited-state geometries, which is beneficial for the pore-filling of HTMs.39 Thus, by considering the pore-filling and the optical absorption in the visible region, the newly designed molecules are potential candidates for improving the performance of PSCs.

3.3 Exciton binding energy and charge transfer amount
To achieve effective charge transport, the bound electron–hole pairs should be dissociated into fully separated positive and negative charges to escape from the coulombic attraction. The exciton binding energy (EB) is defined as the energy difference between the neutral exciton and the two free charge carriers, and can be estimated by taking the energy difference between the electronic and optical band gaps.40 The electronic band gap is approximated as the difference between the HOMO and the LUMO energies, and the optical gap is generally taken as the first singlet excitation energy.41 As collected in Table 1, the EB values of the designed molecules range from 0.53 eV to 0.73 eV, which are obviously smaller than that of spiro-OMeTAD (0.87 eV). The results indicate that the electron–hole pairs of newly designed molecules can more easily dissociate into free charge carriers than that of spiro-OMeTAD, and further facilitate the hole transport and improve the short circuit current density.
Besides the EB, the amount of charge transfer (qCT) upon electronic transition can also reflect the coulombic attraction in electron–hole pairs. Generally, the more the amount of transferred charge is, the weaker the coulombic attraction and the easier the dissociation of the exciton is. The qCT values are calculated with the method reported by Ciofini et al.,42,43 and the results are collected in Table 1. The maps of the charge density difference for T2, T5, T6, T7 and NTT-4TPA are displayed in Fig. 6. As listed in Table 1, the qCT of the designed molecules ranges from 0.51e to 0.64e except for T1 with a smaller value of 0.46e. Obviously, the newly designed molecules exhibit a similar charge transfer character to that of spiro-OMeTAD (0.59e). In summary, easy charge separation can be expected for the designed molecules due to the large transferred charges and the small exciton energies.

3.4 Hole mobility
Many studies have clarified that the hole mobility of HTMs plays an important role in enlarging the short circuit current density and the fill factor of PSCs.44,45 Hence, obtaining reliable hole mobility is an important step in developing potential efficient HTMs. Marcus theory and the Einstein relationship are employed in this work to calculate the hole mobility of newly designed molecules. According to the Marcus formula in computational methods, the small reorganization energy and the large transfer integral are beneficial for obtaining the high hole mobility. Previous studies have testified that the most stable dimer can produce the largest transfer integral value, and further to determine the hole mobility of HTMs.34,35 Thus, the hole-transporting pathways in this work are simplified from three-dimensions to one-dimension. To obtain the stable dimers, the molecular dynamics (MD) simulation and the DFT calculations are employed. The 31 ps MD simulations are carried out firstly at 300 K with a time step of 1 fs using the DFTB+ 1.2.2 package,46 and secondly, the molecular dimers are relaxed to their potential energy minimum based on the initial structures with the lowest energies from dynamics simulations using the Gaussian09 package with the B3LYP/6-31G* method. The total electronic energy evolution of investigated dimers as a function of simulation time is displayed in Fig. S2 and S3.†
The reorganization energy (λ) is one of the key parameters that determine the hole transport rate of HTMs. Faster hole transport can be achieved with a lower reorganization energy. Normally, the reorganization energy comes from the contributions of nuclear reorganization energy and external polarized energy. It is known that the external polarized energy is obviously lower than that of the nuclear part based on polarized force field calculations,47 and thus the external reorganization energy is not considered in this work. As shown in Fig. 7, T2, T5, and T6 exhibit the lowest reorganization energy of 0.06 eV, which is derived from the excellent π-conjugated character and molecular planarity. The reorganization energies of T3, T7, T8, T9 and NTT-4TPA range from 0.08 eV to 0.12 eV, which are similar to the calculated value of spiro-OMeTAD (0.11 eV). The alteration of the mixed carbon–carbon single bond and oxygen-bridge, and the double oxygen-bridges can distinctly reduce the reorganization energies of predicted molecules. However, T1 and T4 display large values of 0.14 eV and 0.19 eV, which may be adverse for charge transport. In summary, the lower reorganization energies of T2, T3, T5, T6, T8 and NTT-4TPA are beneficial for improving the hole transport.
 Fig. 7  Calculated nuclear reorganization energies of the investigated molecules. 
Based on the stable dimers of designed molecules, centroid to centroid distances (ri), hole transfer integrals (VAB), hole hopping rates (κ), and the hole mobility (μ) are calculated. As listed in Table 2 and depicted in Fig. 8, the designed molecules display high hole mobilities in the order of about 10−1 cm2 V−1 s−1 except for T4 with a low mobility of 2.12 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1. This can be explained by the fact that the TPA-based derivatives with a planar core have large transfer integrals (10−2 eV) between adjacent molecules due to the short centroid to centroid distances and the strong π–π interactions. The quasi-planar molecular architecture and the enhanced π–π coupling can effectively enlarge the transfer integral between adjacent molecules. The small μ value of T4 is mainly contributed by the low hole transfer integral of 6.13 × 10−3 eV, which may be derived from the localized HOMO distributions (as displayed in Fig. 2). Meanwhile, the large reorganization energies of T1 and T4, and the large centroid to centroid distance of T9 may also be adverse for hole transport in HTMs. On the other hand, the up-shifted HOMO levels of T3 and T8 (as depicted in Fig. 3) is a disadvantage for enlarging the open circuit voltage of PSCs. Thus, taking into consideration various elements, T5, T6, T7 and NTT-4TPA are potential candidates for the MAPbI3 perovskite, and T2 with a deep HOMO level is more suitable for mixed (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15. The high hole mobility of the newly designed molecules allows them to function as efficient HTMs without the need for extra doping, which can further simplify device fabrication and improve the cell stabilities.

3.5 Solubility and stability
For easy fabrication of PSCs, the solubility and stability of the designed molecules are also evaluated. The solubility of organic small molecule materials can be predicted using solvation free energy (ΔGsolv), which is defined as the difference in free energies of solute in solution and in the gas phase.48 The more negative the solvation free energy is, the better the solution of materials. As listed in Table 1, the ΔGsolv values of the designed molecules range from −19.9 kcal mol−1 to −28.5 kcal mol−1, and with the increase of methoxyl in side arms, the ΔGsolv becomes more negative from T9 (−19.9 kcal mol−1) to T7 (−22.5 kcal mol−1), and to T8 (−28.5 kcal mol−1). Compared with the value of spiro-OMeTAD (−18.3 kcal mol−1), the newly designed molecules exhibit more negative solvation free energies. These results show that these molecules are likely to have greater solubility than spiro-OMeTAD, and further facilitate cell fabrication at lower cost.
The stability of organic semiconductors can be estimated by absolute hardness (η),49 which is the resistance of the chemical potential to the change in the number of electrons. The larger the absolute hardness is, the higher the stability of the materials. The absolute hardness of the designed molecules is calculated using the formula η = (IP − EA)/2,50 where IP represents the adiabatic ionization potential, and EA represents the adiabatic electron affinity. As presented in Table 1, the newly designed molecules exhibit approximate η values from 1.19 eV to 1.46 eV except for T4 with the lowest value of 1.08 eV, which implies that these molecules have similar stabilities. Compared with the value of spiro-OMeTAD (1.62 eV), the η values of the designed molecules are somewhat lower, and the deviations between spiro-OMeTAD and the designed molecules range from 0.16 eV to 0.43 eV. The calculated η values indicate that the stability of newly designed molecules is comparable to that of spiro-OMeTAD.
3.6 Synthesis method and cost
From an experimental viewpoint, we believe that the newly designed molecules can be synthesized, and the conjectural synthetic pathways are shown in Fig. S4.†51 As shown in Fig. S4,† four p-methoxytriphenylamine units can be covalently linked to the NTT core by a Suzuki cross-coupling reaction to obtain the model molecule NTT-4TPA. Besides, the oxygen-bridged triphenylamine derivatives can be synthesized according to previous reports by a twofold intramolecular nucleophilic aromatic substitution with o-iodoanisole and 2,6-difluoroaniline as starting materials.13,52 Considering the high synthetic cost of the 2,2′,7,7′-tetrabromo-9,9′-spirobifluorene (4Br-SBF, 33.89 $ per g)53 core of spiro-OMeTAD, the experimental synthetic pathways of the NTT unit are also shown in Fig. S5,†54,55 and compared with the lengthy synthetic pathways of the 4Br-SBF core, low fabrication costs of predicted molecules can be expected.
3.7 HTM-CH3NH3PbI3 system
As compared with the isolated HTM molecules, the studies about the interfacial properties between HTMs and CH3NH3PbI3 are still less due to the complex organic–inorganic structure for CH3NH3PbI3. In order to better understand the influences of CH3NH3PbI3 surface on the properties of HTMs, the HTM-CH3NH3PbI3 systems are investigated using the CP2K/QUICKSTEP package.56,57 The computational details and optimized geometries are shown in the ESI (Fig. S6–S8†). There are two problems that need to be carefully addressed before the adsorption study. One is the choice of the surface of CH3NH3PbI3. The (001) facet is employed as the adsorption surface since it has been testified to be favorable for hole injection into HTMs.58 Herein, the (CH3NH3PbI3)64 cluster is obtained by appropriately cutting a tetragonal slab.59 The other is the adsorption configuration of HTMs on the CH3NH3PbI3 surface. It has been reported that the interaction between HTMs and CH3NH3PbI3 is weak physisorption,60 and the parallel adsorption configuration is energetically favorable for the HTMs with a big π-conjugated core,61 and thus this adsorption model was adopted for the newly designed HTMs.
In order to simulate the electronic and energetic properties of the HTM-CH3NH3PbI3 system, two representative molecules spiro-OMeTAD and NTT-4TPA are selected. As displayed in Fig. 9, the HOMOs of the adsorbed HTMs exhibit π-conjugated features, which are similar to the distributions of isolated HTM molecules. Compared with that of spiro-OMeTAD, the HOMO of NTT-4TPA is more delocalized, and considering its parallel adsorption configuration, the easier hole injection can be expected for NTT-4TPA. In addition, an alternative hole-transfer pathway has been presented due to the interaction between HTM thiophene and CH3NH3PbI3 iodine atoms.62 The HOMO energy levels of the investigated HTMs are −5.07 (spiro-OMeTAD) and −5.17 (NTT-4TPA) eV, respectively, which exhibit a slightly positive shift in comparison with that of isolated molecules (−5.08 and −5.25 eV, respectively). Accordingly, the absorption spectra also display a somewhat red-shift, and the maximal absorption wavelengths are found to locate at 415 and 524 nm, respectively. In summary, the simulated results indicate that the influence of the CH3NH3PbI3 surface on the properties of HTMs is moderate, and the properties of isolated HTM molecules can also be a good reference for the choice of photovoltaic materials used in PSCs.

4. Conclusions
In principle, rational design and understanding of the energy level structures and hole-transporting behavior is desirable for hole-transporting materials to develop more efficient PSCs. In this manuscript, we methodically investigated the relationship between the structures and the properties of organic HTMs regarding electronic energy alignments, optical absorption, and hole-transporting properties. A model molecule NTT-4TPA with a symmetrical NTT core and four TPA side arms was introduced for the first time, and by replacing the TPA side arms simultaneously, nine new hole-transporting molecules were tailored. Through structural modifications, the HOMO levels of the newly designed molecules can be regulated in an energy range from −5.08 eV to −5.61 eV, which is beneficial for the interfacial energy regulation. Inserting the carbon–carbon single bond between two adjacent phenyl groups of the TPA unit can stabilize the HOMO levels, whereas the oxygen-bridge makes the HOMOs up-shift. The quasi-planar molecular architecture and the extended π-conjugation character could promote the electronic coupling between adjacent molecules, and coupled with the lower reorganization energies, high hole mobilities are obtained. In summary, by considering the various elements simultaneously, the newly designed T2, T5, T6 and T7, and the model NTT-4TPA are believed to be the promising candidates toward more efficient PSCs. We hope that our work could provide some clues for experimentalists to design and synthesize new organic HTMs, and further structural optimization should be conducted by considering the one-dimensional linear and two-dimensional planar architectures simultaneously.
