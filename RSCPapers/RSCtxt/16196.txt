The perovskite layer is usually prepared from a solution of precursors. We found that the PbI2 purity has a significant effect on the crystallinity, charge carrier dynamics, and photovoltaic properties of the perovskite films. Planar heterojunction PSCs using highly pure PbI2 showed a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 16.4%, which was higher than that of control PSCs with low purity PbI2 by 30–40%. Steady-state photoluminescence (PL), time-resolved PL (TR-PL) and femtosecond transient absorption measurements (FS-TA) revealed that impurities can lower the electron lifetime and increase the non-radiative recombination. This study implies that the PCEs of the perovskite solar cell devices could be further boosted by controlling the precursor purity.
Introduction
Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted considerable attention because of their low fabrication cost and high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs).1–8 Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite materials like methylammonium lead triiodide (CH3NH3PbI3) can have high light absorption coefficients, high charge carrier mobilities, long charge diffusion lengths, and tunable band gap. Great progress has been made in this area since 2012. PCEs of over 15% were reported by many labs.4,5,9,10 Different methods were developed to deposit the perovskite layer, such as vapor deposition, two-step sequential deposition or solvent engineering of one-step deposition based methods. A PCE of up to 20.1% was recently reported.11 PSCs can be classified into two categories in terms of the device architecture, one with a mesoporous layer and another with only planar layers.10,12,13 Compared to PSCs with a mesoporous layer, planar PSCs have a simpler structure and better reproducibility.14–17 Recently, the research on planar heterojunction PSCs with poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene): poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) as the hole transport layer and [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) as the electron transport layer made great progress.4 PCEs could be reached up to 18%.
The photovoltaic performance of PSCs strongly depends on the morphology of the perovskite layer, which is sensitive to the experimental conditions during the perovskite material deposition. Many factors have been investigated and optimized to achieve a perovskite film with high quality.18–20 However, there is no report on the effect of the precursor purity on the quality of the perovskite film and the photovoltaic performance of PSCs. As reported on organic solar cells in the literature, impurities in the active film have been defined as a hindrance that deteriorates the device performance.21–25 They could affect the charge carrier recombination dynamics, charge carrier transport as well as some other physical properties. Presumably, the purity should be an important factor to further boost the photovoltaic performance of PSCs. Therefore, we studied the effect of the perovskite precursor purity on the formation and properties of the perovskite films and the photovoltaic performance of PSCs. We found that the impurities in the precursor could lower the film crystallinity, charge carrier lifetime and diffusion length, as well as photovoltaic performance. The impurities in the PbI2 precursor also decrease short-circuit current (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF) simultaneously of PSCs. PSCs with a high-purity precursor can exhibit a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 16.4% with a Jsc of 21.5 mA cm−2, Voc of 1.01 V, and FF of 0.76. The PCE is higher than that of devices with a low-purity precursor by 30–40%.
Results and discussion
PbI2 samples supplied by vendors have different purities. The impurities may be byproducts during PbI2 production and other transition metal residues. Low-purity PbI2 (99%) powder and high-purity (99.999%) PbI2 beads were used to fabricate the perovskite layer of planar heterojunction PSCs, ITO/PEDOT:PSS (35–40 nm)/perovskite (∼260 nm)/PCBM (∼55 nm)/LiF (0.5 nm)/Al (Ag). Current density (J)–voltage (V) characteristics of these devices fabricated under the same experimental conditions are shown in Fig. 1a. The performance parameters, including Voc, Jsc, FF, and PCEs, are summarized in Table 1. The precursor purity significantly affects the photovoltaic performance. The device with a low-purity precursor exhibits an average PCE of only 11.9%, which is significantly lower than that (15.8%) of the PSC with a high-purity precursor. The increase in the purity of the precursor simultaneously improves all the photovoltaic parameters, including Jsc, Voc and FF. Fig. 1b shows the J–V characteristics of the best performing device, which exhibits a remarkable Jsc of 21.5 mA cm−2, Voc of 1.01 V, FF of 0.76, and an overall PCE of 16.4%.

The excellent Jsc and FF values of the device with a high-purity precursor can be ascribed to the improvement in the charge carrier transport and decrease in the charge recombination induced by impurity-related traps. The higher Voc value indicates a less potential loss for the high-purity perovskite film, which is reflected by the relationship of the Voc/Eg ratio. The Voc/Eg ratios of the PSCs with high-purity and low-purity precursors are 0.64 and 0.58, respectively. The less potential loss (Eg − qVoc = 0.57 eV) and the higher Voc/Eg value of 0.64 are responsible for the improved Voc and FF as well as the enhanced PCE for the high purity devices.26 To deeply understand the recombination of photogenerated carriers during the device operation, Voc was measured as a function of light intensity (Fig. 1c). The linear fitting of the Vocvs. logarithm of the light intensity suggests a slope of 1.25 kBT/q and 1.48 kBT/q (where kB is the Boltzmann constant, T is the absolute temperature, and q is the elementary charge) for the PSCs with high-purity and low-purity precursors, respectively. These results suggest that the low purity device has a larger trap-assisted recombination compared to the high purity device. This is similar to the purity effect on the photovoltaic performance of organic solar cells.21–25
The effect of precursor purity is also examined by using the internal photo-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) measurements. It is known that the IPCE spectra could provide information on the components primarily responsible for converting absorbed photons to the collected electrons and holes. As shown in Fig. 1d, the high-purity precursor based device shows higher photon-to-electricity conversion efficiency than the low-purity based device. The high purity device exhibited higher IPCE value up to 80% within the spectra range of 400–780 nm. The increase in the IPCE efficiency suggests that a high-purity precursor may give rise to stronger light absorption and lower charge recombination and improve charge transport.
In order to further understand the precursor effect on the photovoltaic performance of the PSCs, series resistance (Rs) of the devices was obtained from the J–V curves measured in the dark. Rs is 3.52 Ω cm2 for the devices with a low-purity precursor, and it decreases to 1.68 Ω cm2 for the device with a high-purity precursor. These Rs values are consistent with the photovoltaic performances of the PSCs.
The hysteresis in the J–V curves of the PSCs was also studied, since it has been reported that different scanning directions will induce overestimation or underestimation of the device performance in different device structures.27–31 As shown in Fig. 2a and Fig. S1 in the ESI,†J–V curves of the PSCs were recorded along the forward and reverse directions at a scan rate of 40 mV s−1 under AM 1.5G illumination. The J–V curves of the forward and reverse scans coincide for both devices indicating that the device parameters and efficiency almost have no change. This is similar to other planar heterojunction PSCs.8,32 The hysteresis is probably not related to the impurities in the perovskite layer.

The Al cathode can be corroded by the perovskite materials, and it will release compounds like HI or H2. These compounds can be considered as impurities as well and make this study complicated. To avoid these impurities, Ag was used to substitute Al as the cathode (Fig. 2b).33 Rhodamine 101 was also exploited as the interlayer to facilitate the electron collection.34 The device with a high-purity precursor possesses a PCE of 15.2% with a Jsc of 20.3 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.98 V, and FF of 0.76, compared to the 12.0% PCE of the low purity device with a Jsc of 18.2 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.92, and a FF of 0.72. The different performances of these devices with high-purity and low-purity PbI2 are consistent with those of the devices with Al as the cathode. Hence, the difference in the photovoltaic performance of the PSCs with different PbI2 precursors is not related to the cathode.
Perovskite materials with mixed halogen elements are popular in many PSCs. We also investigated the purity effect on the devices with mixed perovskite materials, MAPb(I0.9Br0.1)3 and MAPb(I0.9Cl0.1)3. Br or Cl was introduced by replacing PbI2 with highly pure PbBr2 (99.999%) or PbCl2 (99.999%). The device performances are presented in Fig. 2c–d and Table 1. The device with high-purity MAPb(I0.9Br0.1)3 exhibits a PCE of 15.2%, much higher than that (12.3%) with the low-purity MAPb(I0.9Br0.1)3. Similar different efficiencies were observed on devices with MAPb(I0.9Cl0.1)3. The PCEs are 16.0% and 13.0% for the devices with high-purity and low purity precursors, respectively. All the Jsc, Voc, and FF values of the devices with high-purity PbI2 are higher than those with low-purity PbI2. These results clearly reveal the feasibility of controlling the precursor purity to enhance the PCEs of PSCs.
Based on these results, we can conclude that the performance difference is caused by the PbI2 purity since all the other fabrication conditions are the same. In order to gain better understanding on the impurity effect, we intentionally introduced some impurities into the precursor solutions. These impurities include alkaline metal cations that can replace MA cations, metals or transition metal cations that can substitute Pb element, and other halides that can replace iodide. We found that the Pb substitution has a crucial effect on the cell performance. Only 1.0 mole% of metal impurities like Sn, In, Fe, Bi, and so on can dramatically decrease or kill the solar cell performance (Fig. S2†). In contrast, introducing a small amount of alkaline metal cations like Li, Na and K can slightly enhance the Jsc value, and incorporating a small amount of halides like Br and Cl does not affect or improve the photovoltaic performance. Therefore, the most possible impurities in the precursor are the trace amount of metal or transition metal impurities.
Presumably, the impurities in the perovskite layer can create trapping sites which facilitate the charge recombination and affect charge transport and charge carrier lifetime.3,18,35 The crystallinity of perovskite films was studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD). As shown in Fig. 3a, both MAPbI3 thin films with different precursor purities exhibit strong diffraction patterns at 14.2°, 28.5°, and 31.9°, which can be assigned to (110), (220), and (310) crystal planes of the tetragonal perovskite phase, respectively.36 But the diffraction intensity of the high-purity film is much higher that that of the low-purity film. This indicates that the former has higher crystallinity and fewer defects. The crystallite sizes of the perovskite films estimated in terms of the Scherrer equation are 88 ± 5 nm and 109 ± 11 nm for the low-purity and high-purity films, respectively. The perovskite thin film morphology was further investigated by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM). As shown in Fig. 3c–d and Fig. S3,† the prepared thin films with different purities both showed much more uniform regular crystallites with better surface coverage. The average crystal size of the high purity thin film showed a slight increase compared to the low purity thin film, which is consistent with XRD results. Further photo-physical and electrical measurements are necessary to elucidate the difference between these two films. Probably, the impurities could affect the crystal growth through introducing more nucleation sites and thus leads to small crystallites.37

(c and d) The FE-SEM images of low purity (c) and high purity (d) based perovskite thin films. The scale bar is 800 nm. 
The light absorption of the perovskite thin films with different purities was also studied by UV-vis spectroscopy (Fig. 3b). The thin film has strong absorption from UV down to the near-infrared range with the absorption onset at ca. 780–790 nm (optical band gap ≈ 1.58 eV). Compared to the low-purity film, the high-purity film shows slightly higher absorption. This can be attributed to the higher crystallinity of the latter.
The hole and electron mobilities of these perovskite thin films were measured to further understand the purity effect on charge transport properties of the films. We measured the hole and electron mobilities of the MAPbI3 using hole-only and electron-only devices. The J–V curves were analyzed by using the space-charge limited current (SCLC) model to extract the carrier mobility (Fig. S4†). The hole mobilities are 1.7 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 2.4 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the low and high purity devices, respectively. The electron mobilities of the low purity and high purity devices are 7.7 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 3.5 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The electron mobility is much higher compared to hole mobility, which can be proved by our ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) measurements (Fig. S5†). According to the UPS result, the Fermi level and valence band maximum (VBM) of MAPbI3 are measured to be around 4.30 eV and 5.70 eV, respectively. Considering its bandgap of about 1.58 eV, the conduction band minimum (CBM) of MAPbI3 is calculated to be around 4.12 eV. This indicates that the perovskite MAPbI3 showed a highly n-doped character, which is similar to previously reported results.38 The n-doping character may be due to the presence of traces of metallic lead in perovskite; this metallic lead could possible introduce weakly bound electrons to the crystal domains resulting in n-doping properties.39 These observations suggest that the impurities in the perovskite phase mostly act as electron traps and have less effect on the energy levels according to the UPS spectra.
To investigate the photo-conversion processes associated with the impurities in the perovskite precursors, steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved PL were carried out on both thin films. The steady-state PL is performed on the quartz substrates, and shown in Fig. 4a. The high purity thin film exhibited a larger intensity of PL emission compared to the low purity counterpart. The transient photo-excited carriers were investigated by using time-resolved PL measurements based on perovskite films prepared on glass substrates. Detailed information about the thin film measurement, and fitting methodology can be found in the experimental part. Perovskite thin films are known to be subject to two-carrier recombination under high fluorescence which results in a fast PL decay.40,41 The time-resolved PL measurement was performed at a low energy density (0.2 μJ cm−2) to minimize the second order decay. The PL decay and bi-exponentially fitted curves of these two thin films are shown in Fig. 4b. The fitted parameters are summarized in Table 2, and the average PL lifetimes of perovskite thin films prepared from high purity and low purity precursors were calculated to be 196.26 ns and 44.97 ns, respectively. By combining the steady state and time-resolved PL studies, the high purity thin films displayed higher PL and a slower PL decay rate, which is due to a lower defect density. Therefore, the perovskite MAPbI3 with high purity has a high electron transport rate and a low carrier recombination rate compared to the low purity counterpart. The time-resolved PL study implies that high purity MAPbI3 would also possess a longer charge diffusion length, which is a significant parameter for efficient charge harvesting and charge collection in thick solar cell devices.

Electron or hole diffusion behavior was separately studied by depositing an electron extracting layer (PCBM) or a hole extracting layer (PEDOT:PSS) adjacent to the perovskite thin films. The one dimensional diffusion model15,42 was employed to study the carrier diffusion length. The carrier distribution n(z,t) throughout the MAPbI3 thin films can be described by  where D is the diffusion coefficient and k(t) is the PL decay rate of MAPbI3 thin films in the absence of quenchers. The initial carrier distribution can be described as n(z,0) = n0exp(−αz), where α is the linear absorption coefficient of MAPbI3 thin films at the excitation wavelength of 438 nm. Under the assumption of a perfect quencher, i.e. all carriers were quenched at the interface of the quenching layer with an infinite quenching rate; a minimum value of the diffusion coefficient can be fitted by using eqn (1) in the ESI. Thus, the diffusion length LD is obtained by using LD = (Dτ0)1/2, where τ0 is the PL lifetime in the absence of the quenchers. PL decay fitting curves from this 1D diffusion model are shown in Fig. 4c–d and the fitted parameters are summarized in Table 2. The hole and electron diffusion lengths in high purity films are 666 nm and 818 nm, respectively. High purity thin films displayed much longer electron or hole diffusion lengths compared to the low purity counterpart. Thus, we can attribute the current loss in the low purity thin films to the shorter carrier lifetime and diffusion length. It can be figured out that the impurities in the bulk thin film mainly act as recombination centers. And these impurities could decrease the carrier lifetime and diffusion length.
To better understand the photo-excited states, carrier dynamics in the ultrafast regime were studied by using femtosecond transient absorption measurements. To date, ultrafast carrier kinetics of MAPbI3 thin films have been investigated and reported,1,40,41,43–47 however, due to its complex nature, its band structure has not been fully understood and elucidated. Xing et al.44 demonstrated a model which evidenced the hot hole cooling from a lower valence band (VB) to an upper VB. However, Kevin et al.43 proposed an extra charge transfer band in the excited state, which is supported by the consistency between recovery kinetics of the photo-induced absorption band and the blue bleaching band. As shown in Fig. 5a–b, the transient absorption spectra display two features, a photo-induced absorption band centered at 600 nm and a bleaching band centered at 760 nm. Corresponding to other reports, the bleaching band is assigned to the state filling effect of the conduction band. Interestingly, shown in Fig. 5c, this bleaching band shows an asymmetric time evolution feature, whose recovery time of the bleaching band increases from the blue edge to the red edge. The kinetics for the bleaching band probed at different wavelengths and the photo-induced absorption band were fitted well to a bi-exponential decay, listed in Table 3. This inhomogeneous decay time indicates that a different transient component superposes this bleaching band, and this species dominates at the blue edge, but gradually vanishes to the red edge. This could be further confirmed by the kinetics probed at 780 nm, which shows an initial fast transient absorption and a slow built-up to the bleaching peak. The bleaching band shows spectral narrowing as the delay time of the pump and probe pulse increases, which agrees well with the band-filling model.43,44 Thus, the cross-over point between the photo-induced absorption band and bleaching band red shifts with delay time, resulting in an obscure isosbestic point. Our results illustrate that the band filling effect generates a transient absorption species superposed with the bleaching band.

To minimize the influence of the band filling effect, the bleaching recovery dynamics at the red edge of the bleaching band are used to track the population of photoexcited carriers. To evaluate the average of two different transient species, the bleaching recovery curves were fitted to be a bi-exponential function, where the positive and negative terms are corresponding to bleaching and band filling effects. As shown in Fig. 5d, the high purity film displays a slower effective carrier recombination (335.4 ps) compared to the low purity counterpart (246.6 ps), which is consistent with the time-resolved PL study discussed above. The presence of impurities leads to a rapid charge recombination, as evidenced by the rapid decay of the low purity film, while a higher purity film could reduce the amount of charge recombination at long timescales.
Conclusions
In summary, we have studied the precursor purity effect on the perovskite solar cell device for the first time. It was found that the impurities in the perovskite precursor could affect the perovskite thin film crystallization, charge carrier lifetime, and charge carrier recombination. And the impurities in the thin films provide recombination channels which harm the solar cell performance. The planar heterojunction solar cell device based on a controlled high purity precursor showed 35–40% enhancement in the PCE (16.4%) with a simultaneous enhancement of Jsc (21.5 mA cm−2), Voc (1.01 V), and FF (0.76) compared to the low purity based device. This study gives an implication that to achieve the best perovskite solar cell, it is necessary to control the precursor purity. Most importantly, this work opens an avenue for the impurity related studies in perovskite solar cells. In order to achieve considerable perovskite solar cell performance, the precursor impurity level needs to be controlled within the threshold limit.

Other materials, including lead(II) iodide (PbI2, 99% and 99.999% purity), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, anhydrous, ≥99.9% purity), γ-butyrolactone (GBL, ≥99% purity), LiF (≥99% purity), chlorobenzene (anhydrous, 99.8% purity) and toluene (anhydrous, 99.5% purity), were supplied by Sigma-Aldrich. All materials are used without further purification.
Fabrication of the thin film Perovskite devices
ITO glass substrates were cleaned sequentially by sonication in detergent, deionized water, acetone, and isopropanol for 20 min each. After drying under a N2 stream, substrates were further treated with UV-ozone for 15 min. A PEDOT:PSS (Baytron 4083 filtered through a 0.45 μm filter) hole transporting layer with a thickness of ∼40 nm was spin-coated onto ITO substrates at 6000 rpm for 40 s and annealed at 150 °C for 15 min in air. The substrates were then transferred into a N2 filled glovebox, and spin coated with prepared different precursor solutions containing 1.4 M PbI2 and 1.4 M MAI in the co-solvent of DMSO:GBL (3:7 vol. ratio) at 1000 rpm for 20 s, and washed with toluene after 20 s at 5000 rpm. Then the substrates were annealed at 100 °C for 15 min. The thickness of the perovskite thin films is around 260 nm, determined by using a surface step profiler. The electron-transporting layer (PCBM, 20 mg mL−1 in chlorobenzene) was then deposited by spin coating at 2000 rpm for 1 min. The LiF (0.5 nm) interlayer and Al (100 nm) electrodes were deposited under high vacuum (<1 × 10−6 Torr) through a shadow mask, defining a device area of 0.11 cm2, by thermal evaporation. The SCLC device was fabricated with a configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/MAPbI3/MoO3/Ag for the hole only device, and ITO/PEI/MAPbI3/PCBM/LiF/Al for the electron only device. All J–V curves were recorded using a Keithley 2400 source meter unit. The device photocurrent was measured under AM 1.5 illumination condition at an intensity of 100 mW cm−2 which was accurately calibrated using a standard Si photodiode detector. The IPCE spectra studied here were obtained from an IPCE setup consisting of a Xenon lamp (Oriel, 300 W) as the light source, a Cornerstone 260 Oriel 74125 monochromator, a lock-in amplifier (SR830, Stanford Research Corp), and a Si-based diode (J115711-1-Si detector) for calibration.
Thin film characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were acquired using a Bruker D8 Advance XRD Instrument. Absorption spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu UV-1800 spectrophotometer. Electron scanning microscopy (SEM) images were obtained with a Zeiss Supra-40 SEM. Film thickness was determined by using a surface profilometer (KLA Tencor, Alpha-Step IQ). Photoluminescence spectra were obtained on a LS 55 Fluorescence Spectrometer (PerkinElmer) with an excitation wavelength of 410 nm. Time-resolved photoluminescence: the excitation source is a diode laser (NanoLED) working at a repetition rate of 10 MHz, with a wavelength of 438 nm and a pulse duration of ∼260 ps. The scattering of excitation light was eliminated by using a two 600 nm long pass filter. Photoluminescence is collected and detected by using an avalanche photon diode (Micro photon device, PicoQuant) attached to a time-correlated single photon counting card (TCSPC PicoHarp 300, PicoQuant).
Femtosecond transient absorption: the laser pulses generated from a mode-locked Ti:sapphire oscillator seeded regenerative amplifier working at 800 nm with a repetition rate of 1 kHz and a pulse duration of 50 fs. The 800 nm laser was split into two portions. An optical parametric amplifier (TOPAS, Light conversion) was pumped by one portion (with an average power of 1 W) of this 800 nm laser. The generated beam with a wavelength of 500 nm serves as the “pump” in the typical pump–probe scheme. The residual portion of the 800 nm laser pulses generated a white light continuum in a 1 mm sapphire plate. The fluctuation of both pump and probe beams was cancelled out. The pump beam was focused onto the film with a beam size of 300 μm and overlapped with a smaller diameter probe beam, ∼100 μm. The time delay of the pump and probe laser pulses was varied by using a computer controlled translational stage (Newport, ESP300). The pump beam was modulated by using an optical chopper at a frequency of 500 Hz. The variation transmittance at a selected probe wavelength was recorded as a function of time delay between pump and probe pulses.
