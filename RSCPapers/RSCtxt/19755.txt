    , Accepted 12th October 2011First published on 13th October 2011AbstractThe search for earth-abundant semiconductors and co-catalysts for water oxidation is an important step towards conversion of solar energy into fuel chemicals in a sustainable manner. Here, we report the integration of Co3O4 nanoparticles within graphitic carbon nitride to construct a nanohybrid photocatalyst made of abundant elements for the photocatalytic generation of oxygen from water, achieving an apparent quantum efficiency of 1.1% at 420 nm for water splitting to oxygen. The present system shows great promise in polymer photocatalysis for applications in future energy cycles based on sustainable materials.

Water
oxidation is a crucial step in a series of photosynthetic reactions in chloroplasts, providing a source of electrons and protons required for the conversion of sunlight, CO2 and H2O into biomass.1 This reaction, involving multi-electron/proton transfers and O–O formation, is regarded as the key bottleneck in developing technical photosynthetic devices for any practical application and is the central scientific and technological challenge in the community.1,2 From both half reaction, water oxidation is by far more complicated, while successful water reduction has been described and can for instance be promoted by Pt-cocatalysts.3 A good model case to illustrate this point is water electrolysis: using even advanced electrodes allows rather low overpotentials at the H2-generating electrode, while the oxygen side is still biased with comparably large overpotentials.4
This motivated intensified research on pursuing efficient water-oxidation catalysts (WOCs). A range of organometallic complexes (mostly Ru-based)4d,5 and metal oxide (RuO2, IrOx, MnOxetc.)6 represents the cutting edge of the progress of the field, while the photosynthetic water oxidation with Mn4CaOx clusters of photosystem II still serves as an inspiration for the development of artificial WOCs using more abundant elements.7
Recently, efficient oxygen evolution from phosphate-buffered solution by in situelectrodeposition of Co-based films (termed as Co-Pi) has been developed, which is capable of producing 1.2 mA cm−2 current densities with a bias voltage of 1.5 V vs.NHE at pH7.1b,8 The contribution of Co(IV) intermediates was evidenced with EPR by the same group,8c consistent with early mechanism study on aquocobalt(II) catalyzed water oxidation.9 It can be envisaged that the required energy input to run this catalytic reaction should be replaced with sunlight in part or entirely, e.g. by integrating the WOCs into light-harvesting semiconductor as solar energy transducer. To this end, Choi et al. and Gamelin et al. applied Co-Pi-modified ZnO and α-Fe2O3 as photoanodes for water oxidation driven by solar photovoltaic cells.10 Frei et al. achieved photocatalytic oxygen evolution from water at pH 5.8 by SBA-15 confined Co3O4 nanoclusters, using [Ru (bpy)3]2+ and persulfate as photosensitizer and electron accepter, respectively.11
Once a WOC is combined with the antenna molecules, the stability of sensitizers in this strong oxidizing environment is of great concern, because there is a lot of evidence that high-valent intermediates in the photochemical oxidation of water may degrade organic ligands, leading to deactivation throughout catalytic turnover.12 Highly oxidation-resistant sensitizers, preferably made of all earth-abundant, inexpensive elements and working with visible light are thus a recommendable choice.
Covalent carbon nitride solids have long been predicted to exhibit remarkable physical and chemical properties.13g-C3N4 is the most stable phase of binary carbon nitrides under ambient conditions, being a π-conjugated semiconductor (bandgap = 2.7 eV) with absolute band positions engulfing the H2O redox potentials. Contrary to many other organic semiconductors, g-C3N4 possesses a high thermal and chemical stability against oxidation (stable in O2 up to 550 °C).13a Polymeric g-C3N4 is also a sustainable material as it contains carbon and nitrogen. Thus, g-C3N4 is potentially such a light-harvesting substrate for supporting WOCs.
In this work, a Co-based oxygen evolution catalyst was applied to g-C3N4 to achieve photocatalytic water oxidation. It is reported that g-C3N4 can act as a metal-free photocatalyst to liberate oxygen from water even in the absence of WOC, but with low activity.14 This is due to the relatively low valence band potential (VBP) of g-C3N4 located at +1.4 V vs.NHE in pH7, close to the sum of the thermodynamic potential for water oxidation and the overpotential known from catalysis-free electrooxidation (+0.82 V and ∼+0.6 V vs.NHE in pH7, respectively).15 A sulfur-mediated synthesis of g-C3N4 was able to improve the water oxidation capability by increasing the VBP to +1.6 V vs.NHE at pH7.14 Further improvement of overall efficiencies now can be directed to the minimization of the overpotential by creating tight WOC/g-C3N4 heterojunctions which also promote charge separation. In addition, the combination of this stable solid-state photosensitizer and Co-based WOC are expected to result in robust inorganic-polymeric hybrids of earth-abundant elements (C, N, O, and Co). This sustainable scheme of photocatalytic water oxidation generates protons and electrons with sufficient potential to be further coupled to fuel-generation cascade reactions like hydrogen evolution from water and CO2 photofixation, which are however not discussed in the present work.
Here, g-C3N4 was synthesized by a sulfur-mediated approach using trithiocyanuric acid as starting material,14 and the thus obtained sample was denoted as CNS to differentiate from normal g-C3N4 using melamine as precursor. The metal component was deposited on CNS by a conventional impregnation method using metal chlorides as precursors, followed by calcination at 300 °C. We first studied the effect of various metal species on the photocatalytic activity of CNS for the water oxidation reaction. It was found that Co-species have the best promotional effect of the various metal components examined (Table S1 & S2†). The Co-modified CNS was subjected to several characterization techniques, and the presence of Co(III) and Co(II) was confirmed by XPS analysis (Fig. S3†). However, XRD and TEM studied did not provide any solid-state structural information on Co-species (Fig. S4†), which is likely coordinated chemically to the special docking site of the carbon nitride network.16 Further characterization of those systems is certainly needed. Nevertheless, the observation on the promotional effect of cobalt stimulated us to develop Co-modified CNS with a better defined chemical nature.
We therefore synthesized monodispersed Co3O4 nanoparticles separately and applied them to the carbon nitride matrix. The solution synthesis of Co3O4 particles was carried out according to the literature.17 (for details see the ESI†). Briefly, [Co(NH3)6]3+ was decomposed in the presence of air at 80 °C to yield spinel-like single Co3O4 nanocrystals of ∼3 nm diameter with a narrow size distribution (±0.68 nm) (Fig. 1a, c and d). It is worth mentioning that the particles are free of organic stabilizing agent. Impregnation of CNS matrix with those particles (3 wt%) and thereafter heating at 60 °C in vacuum and 150 °C in air lead to formation of composite with uniformly distributed Co3O4 nanoparticles (Fig. 1e & Fig. S9†). Successful impregnation of CNS with Co3O4 is also supported by selective area electron diffraction (SAED) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) that showed characteristic (311) reflection for Co3O4 (left inset in Fig. 1e and f). Absence of particle aggregations on the CNS surface (Fig. 1e and Fig. S9†) indicates stronger interactions between CNS and Co3O4 than between the particles themselves. These strong interactions are presumably facilitated by the presence of N-containing docking sites on the polymeric tri-s-triazine network and the Co surface ions.16

(a) and (b) are TEM and XRD of as-prepared Co3O4, respectively; (c) HRTEM of single Co3O4 nanocrystal; (d) electron diffraction (ED) patterns of Co3O4; (e) HRTEM image of the Co3O4/CNS hybrids with clearly visible nanoparticles; (f) XRD spectra of nanoparticles, CNS alone and composite, showing presence of the most prominent peak (311), originating from the Co3O4; (g) XPS spectra of bulk Co3O4, Co3O4/CNS and Co3O4/SBA-15. The inset in (a) depicts the size distribution of monodisperse Co3O4, and the right inset in (e) is the HRTEM image of Co3O4 in CNS, while the left inset in (e) is ED patterns of Co3O4 loaded on CNS. 
Further characterization of the nature of Co3O4 nanoparticles on CNS was carried out by XPS analysis (Fig. 1g). The Co2p3/2 line is located in commercial Co3O4 bulk powders at binding energies (BE) of 779.5 eV and is shifted by 0.9 eV toward higher BE for Co3O4@SBA-15, chosen as inert supporter. This shift suggests an enhanced oxidation power of nanosized Co3O4 as compared to the bulk, desirable for water oxidation. A negative shift (0.4 eV) of BE for Co2p3/2 in Co3O4@CNS as compared with Co3O4@SBA-15 indicates the interaction between Co3O4 and electron-rich CNS.
The optical features of the CNS before and after impregnation with the cocatalyst particles were analyzed by UV-vis spectroscopy. The colloidal suspension of the Co3O4 showed multiple bands located at 380 and 675 nm that originate from O2− → Co2+ and O2− → Co3+ transitions, respectively (Fig. 2a).18 Those transition bands are also present in Co3O4@CNS, as indicated by the increase of the absorbance in the UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra of CNS alone and Co3O4/CNS. The otherwise strong photoluminescence of CNS is quenched in the presence of Co3O4 (Fig. 2b). The quenching can be attributed to charge transfer from photoexcited CNS to Co3O4,19 reflecting their tight electronic and spatial interaction. The formation of Co3O4/CNS nanojunctions is believed to promote the direct migration of the photogenerated holes to Co3O4, which inhibits direct luminescent charge recombination.

The inset in (a) is the enlarged spectrum of optical absorption. 
We also examined the effect of Co3O4 nanoparticles on the current-potential characteristics of CNS, as shown in Fig. 2c and d. A stepwise increase of the current accounting for water electrolysis was observed for the Co3O4-modified electrode in the dark. Under light illumination, this onset potential is significantly downshifted by about 0.2 V, indicating the presence of photoactivity already on the macroscopic scale.20 Importantly, the application of Co3O4 nanoparticles onto CNS lowered the onset potential of anodic photocurrent by about 120 mV, owing to the presence of Co3O4 catalyst decreasing the electron-hole recombination even on the macroscopic scale. The Co3O4-modification however also significantly enhances the photocurrent response of CNS, confirming the promotional effect of Co3O4/CNS junctions on the charge transfer kinetics.
In the next set of experiments, we studied the photocatalytic activity of Co3O4/CNS nanocomposites for water oxidation to release O2, using AgNO3 as an electron acceptor to short-cut the reduction side. The detailed experimental procedure is provided in the ESI.†Co3O4 nanoparticles alone are active, but with a very limited oxygen evolution rate (OER) of 0.5 and 1.0 μmol h−1 in visible- (λ > 420 nm) and UV- (λ > 300 nm) light irradiation (Fig. S8†), respectively. This catalytic process is driven by visible excitations from the Co-d (t2g) to the Co-d (teg) band and by ultraviolet excitations from O-2p band to the Co-d (eg), but these transitions suffer from fast charge recombination, as in the similar case of IrO2 for water photooxidation.21 We also tested the activity of pure CNS, also with moderate performance at an OER of 2.8 μmol h−1. It is worth mentioning that this value is nevertheless 3-times higher than the pure inorganic system. Both values can be significantly enhanced to 25.1 μmol h−1 in the heterojunction hybrid system. The selectivity of light-induced holes toward converting water to O2 instead of self-oxidation increased from 37.8% for CNS to 86.3% for Co3O4/CNS nanohybrids. Stable evolution of O2 was indeed observed for the Co3O4/CNS system, producing 90 μmol O2 in an 11 h reaction (Fig. 3a). The turnover number (TON) is calculated to be ∼3210 with respect to the single Co3O4 nanoparticles added (the total number of 3 nm-Co3O4 particles is assumed to be 1.69 × 1016).22 The rate of oxygen evolution was observed to decrease with reaction time >5 h, which is due to the deposition of Ag blocking the catalyst. To confirm that CNS is still active after reaction, the used catalyst was washed with chloronitrious acid to convert deposited-Ag to AgCl, followed by treating the solid with ammonia solution to remove AgCl. We can recover 60% CNS (30 mg) after the treatment, which was then checked for the water oxidation after reloading with 3 wt% Co3O4 nanoparticles. Results show that the catalyst still preserved an OER of 14.5 μmol h−1 even with a reduced amount of Co3O4/CNS. No significant alternation was observed in FTIR and XPS spectrum (Fig. S11 and S12†) of CNS before and after the reaction. These results rather speak for the stable and robust nature of CNS for supporting WOC under working conditions.
 Fig. 3  (a) Oxygen-evolution by CNS, 3 wt% Co3O4/CNS and CNS + 3 wt% Co3O4 (physical mixture), as a function of reaction time under visible light irradiation (λ > 420 nm), and (b) wavelength dependence O2 evolution rate over 3 wt% Co3O4/CNS. The inset in (b) is the O2 evolution curves under visible light (λ > 455 nm). 
To highlight the importance of nanosize effect of WOC, bulk Co3O4 particles with size of ∼250 nm (Fig. S10†) were also applied on CNS, but yielding an OER of 4.7 μmol h−1 under the same experimental conditions, with an O2 selectivity of 45.1%.
Modification with excessive Co3O4 (>5 wt%) nanoparticle, however, lead to a decrease in the activity, due to the light shielding effect. The physical mixture of CNS and 3 wt% Co3O4 nanoparticles gave an OER of 10.3 μmol h−1, indicating the importance on an effective chemical mixing and conjugation. These result supported that the promoted water oxidation catalysis was mainly induced by heterogeneous Co3O4/CNS junctions driven with visible light. After the reaction, inductively coupled plasma (ICP) analysis of the reaction mixture revealed a slight loss (∼0.08 wt%) of Co3O4 from CNS.
The rate of oxygen evolution by 3 wt% Co3O4/CNS hybrid as a function of cutoff wavelength of the incident light is shown in Fig. 3b, which revealed that the OER of the photocatalyst corresponds well to the optical absorption of CNS. This observation supports that water oxidation process is primarily started by light-excitation of carbon nitride polymer. An apparent quantum efficiency of 1.1% was determined for 3 wt% Co3O4/CNS nanohybrids under monochromatized illumination at 420 nm with a photon flux intensity of 49.4 mW. Note that no detectable N2 evolution was measured for the system under such a more practical solar irradiation, suggesting the stability of graphitic-phase carbon nitride polymers for real solar applications.
To conclude, we have demonstrated that the integration of nanosized Co3O4 WOC into the robust carbon nitride polymer as a light-harvesting semiconductor leads to favorable Co3O4/carbon nitride junctions which promote charge separation and allow for the lowering of the overpotential of water oxidation. The inorganic–organic hybrid system described here is active in oxygen evolution from aqueous silver nitrate solution with an apparent quantum yield of 1.1% (at 420 nm), merging Co3O4 water oxidation catalysis and carbon nitride photocatalysis. Future work will be focused on optimizing the system by tuning particle size of Co3O4 and by narrowing the bandgap energy of carbon nitride. This work indicates the great potential of earth-abundant photocatalysts and co-factors for sustainable artificial photosynthesis, which could be integrated to endergonic fuel-generation reactions.
