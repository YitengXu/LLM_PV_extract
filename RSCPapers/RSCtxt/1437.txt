    , Accepted 16th September 2019First published on 27th September 2019AbstractWe present an instructional design strategy to tune the optical absorption ability of organic–inorganic hybrids by managing the internal iodide state. Three bismuth-based hybrids with different internal iodide states were synthesized and display tunable bandgaps from 1.91 eV to 1.87 eV and finally to 1.59 eV.
Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites of ABX3 (A = organic cations, B = metal; and X = Cl, Br, and I) have attracted worldwide attention for photoelectric and photovoltaic applications, benefitting from their high extinction coefficient, small binding energy of exciton, and long charge diffusion length.1–4 To date, the conversion efficiency of lead halide perovskite solar cells with MAPbI3 (MA = CH3NH3+) acting as an optical absorbing layer has reached up to 23.3%, rivalling that of commercial polycrystalline silicon solar cells.5–7 However, the toxicity of lead (Pb) has seriously hampered their practical photoelectric applications.8 As a result, significant efforts have been made worldwide on developing new alternative environmentally friendly hybrid perovskites, such as bismuth, copper and tin based hybrid compounds.9–11 Among them, bismuth-based hybrid materials are of great interest due to their potential semiconducting properties and interesting electron optical properties, in which the 6s2 stereoactive lone-pair electrons of Bi3+ give rise to a large number of fascinating properties, such as enhanced optical absorption.12–14 So far, a variety of bismuth-based perovskites such as (CH3NH3)3Bi2I9,15 [(CH3)3NH]3Bi2I9,16 and (NH4)3Bi2I917 have been developed as efficient light absorbers. Despite the great progress achieved in material exploration, further applications of bismuth-based perovskites are still hindered by the wide corresponding bandgap (Eg) > 1.90 eV, which is far from the ideal bandgap (1.3 eV) for single junction solar cell applications.18–20 Therefore, the rational design of new bismuth-based perovskites with high light absorbing ability is still important basic research and of commercial significance.
Several approaches toward the achievement of narrow bandgap bismuth-based perovskites have been made in recent years.21–23 As one of the most effective strategies, the introduction of partial iodide, named as iodide management, into metal halide perovskites can greatly decrease the concentration of deep-level defects, which significantly improves their light absorbing ability.24 Meanwhile, it shows great potential for material engineering and structural design through incorporating triiodide or iodide.25,26 As reported, in the newly developed lead-free hybrid materials (C6H14N)4I3BiI6,27 and (C3H10N)4I3BiI6,28 by intercalating triiodide, the optical band gaps are tuned to be 1.58 eV and 1.34 eV, which can be comparable and even better than that of CH3NH3PbI3 (∼1.55 eV). Apart from these efforts in developments of lead-free perovskites with strong light absorption, there is no concerted effort to tune the absorption abilities of hybrid perovskites and the structure–property relationship governing the absorption behavior.
Herein, we report three lead-free hybrid materials (bis-(2-dimethylaminoethyl) ether)Bi2I8 (1), (bis-(2-dimethylaminoethyl) ether)2IBi2I9 (2) and (bis-(2-dimethylaminoethyl) ether)3I3Bi3I14 (3) through an instructional design strategy of iodide management. The light absorption performance indicates that the three materials exhibit tuneable light absorption abilities. The band gap was successfully adjusted from 1.91 eV of 1 to 1.87 eV of 2 and finally to 1.59 eV of 3. The structure–property relationships were further interpreted by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This work provides a new route for tuning the light absorption ability of hybrid perovskites.
Block single crystals of the three compounds (1, 2, and 3) were all grown by solution volatilization at room temperature. Their purity was confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD, Fig. S1–S3, ESI†), which was consistent with the simulation diagram derived from the data of the single crystal structure. Notably, the XRD spectra of 1, 2 and 3 powders remained relatively unchanged after 60 days of exposure to the atmosphere. The results show that 1, 2 and 3 are stable under environmental conditions. Meanwhile, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) indicated the high thermal stability of the three compounds (Fig. S4–S6, ESI†). Single crystal XRD analysis reveals that 1 belongs to a zero-dimensional (0D) perovskite-like structure in the monoclinic crystal system with a space group of P21/c. The cell parameters are a = 10.4885(7) Å, b = 24.8912(17) Å, c = 12.3295(9) Å, β = 113.343(2)°, and V = 1521.69 Å3. The asymmetric unit contains a half discrete inorganic four nuclear cluster of [Bi4I16]4− and one protonated bis-(2-dimethylaminoethyl) ether cation. It is worth noting that the anion part is composed of corner-sharing [BiI6]3− octahedral, in which the central bismuth atom coordinates with six coordinated iodine atoms. Notably, organic ammonium cations are connected to anion clusters through weak N–H⋯I hydrogen bond interactions between N and I atoms (Fig. 1b and Fig. S7, ESI†). Upon intercalating I− into the prototype of 1, the crystal structure and morphology enormously changed, forming a crystal motif of 2. Structure analysis shows that 2 adopts an orthorhombic space group of Pbca with a = 15.7709(7) Å, b = 22.3276(12) Å, c = 24.5774(13) Å, α = β = γ = 90°, and V = 8654.35 Å3. It also employs a 0D perovskite-like structure with an asymmetric unit containing one inorganic cluster of [Bi2I9]3−, one iodide and two protonated bis-(2-dimethylaminoethyl) ether cations. The structure of the [Bi2I9]3− cluster and the position in the crystal cells is very similar to that of the previously reported 0D perovskite optical absorption materials, such as [(CH3)3NH]3Bi2I9,20 and Cs3Bi2I9.29 Interestingly, the anion skeleton is composed of a face-sharing octahedron, in which the Bi atoms are coordinated by six iodine atoms, three of them behaving as bridging linkers. Moreover, organic ammonium cations are connected to the anion clusters by weak N–H⋯I hydrogen bond reciprocity between N and H atoms. Meanwhile, N–H⋯I hydrogen bonds also occur between free iodide ions and organic cations (Fig. 1a and Fig. S8, ESI†). The crystal of 3 was formed after inserting triiodide ions into the prototype of 1. The space group is P21/c with a = 20.1467(13) Å, b = 22.7942(13) Å, c = 14.9932(9) Å, β = 91.472(2)°, and V = 6883.02 Å3 and also adopts a 0D perovskite-like structure. The infrastructure unit consists of three major structural components, including [Bi3I14]5− anions, bis-(2-dimethylaminoethyl) ether cations and triiodides, in a ratio of 1:3:1. Interestingly, the anion clusters are three nuclear isolated structures, which have been rarely reported in previous work. Further analysis of the crystal structure shows that Bi1 and Bi2 atoms are connected by three iodides, and Bi2 and Bi3 atoms are connected by one iodide. Moreover, organic cations are bonded to the isolated Bi3I14 octahedron through N1–H1⋯I12, N1–H1⋯I13, N2–H2⋯I12, N2–H2⋯I13, N4–H4⋯I10, N4–H4⋯I13, N5–H5⋯I10, N5–5⋯I11, N6–H6⋯I10, N6–H6⋯I11, and N6–H6⋯I14 hydrogen bonds, respectively (Fig. 1c and Fig. S9, ESI†).

As is known, band gap amplitude is crucial for absorbing photon energy and an excellent optical absorbing material usually needs a small band gap.30 Previous work has shown that the light absorption capacity of the crystals can be significantly enhanced through inserting iodide or triiodide ions.25,27 In order to investigate the effect of iodide and triiodide ions on the light absorption ability of crystals, the diffuse reflection spectra of 1, 2 and 3 are decided and transformed into the absorption spectra by Kubelka–Munk conversion. Their bandgap energies could be inferred by assuming an indirect bandgap from the Tauc plot of (F(R∞)hν)2. It can be seen from Fig. 2a that the absorption spectrum of 1 appears as a vertical band edge at about 646 nm and the band gap value of 1 is computed to be 1.91 eV. This value coincides with its crimson colour, which is similar to those of the previously reported bismuth-based perovskites such as (NH4)3Bi2I9 (2.04 eV),21 (C6H13N)2BiI5 (2.02 eV)31 and so on. After intercalating iodide ions, the colour of 2 remains dark red. Its absorption edge is 662 nm and Eg is approximated to be 1.87 eV which is slightly decreased compared with that of 1. These results indicate that the intercalated iodide ion could slightly increase the light absorption ability of the material. It is also worth noting that the black crystal of 3 exhibits a narrow bandgap of 1.59 eV with a cutoff wavelength of 783 nm, which shows a significant redshift of 137 nm compared with that of 1. The hybrid inserted by the triiodide of 3 shows the lowest band gap of three bismuth-based light absorption materials in this work, which indicates that triiodide ions have an obvious influence on the light absorption ability.

In order to further investigate the effect of iodide and triiodide ions, the partial density of states (PDOS) and band structures of 1, 2 and 3 were calculated by first-principles density functional theory (DFT). For 1, as can be seen from Fig. 3a, the conduction band minimum (CBM) and the valence band maximum (VBM) of 1 are located at different positions in the Brillouin zone, indicating that 1 has the characteristics of an indirect band gap.32 The computed band gap value is 2.51 eV, which is slightly higher than the experimental value of 1.91 eV, which is due to the restriction of the DFT method.33 In addition, Fig. 3a and Fig. S10 (ESI†) show that the valence band maximum originates from I-5p nonbonding orbitals, and the conduction band minimum is mainly offered by Bi-6p and I-5p orbitals. Therefore it can be considered that the valence band maximum and conduction band minimum of 1 are mainly determined by the inorganic framework [Bi4I16]4−.27 When I− was inserted, the band value of 2 shows a slight decrease. The PDOS of 2 shows that iodide has an effect on the conduction band minimum but almost no effect on the valence band maximum (Fig. 2b and Fig. S11, ESI†). After interaction of I3− ions, the band structure calculations also reveal that 3 has an indirect band gap. The calculated band gap value is 1.95 eV which decreases to 0.56 eV compared with that of 1. The PDOS of 3 changed dramatically after inserting triiodide. We can see from Fig. 3c and Fig. S12 (ESI†) that the triiodide ion has a great effect on the valence band and conduction band of 3. Obviously, the DFT calculations further indicate that the triiodide ion has a significant effect on its optical absorption.

To further investigate the semiconducting properties of 2 and 3, we measured their conductivity with respect to temperature in the range of 320–420 K. As can be seen from Fig. 4a and b, the conductivity of 2 and 3 increases gradually with the increase of temperature. Thus, this temperature dependence on conductivity validates the typical semiconducting properties of 2 and 3. Furthermore, based on the large single crystals of 2 and 3, we studied their photoelectric responses under illumination. Firstly, the photocurrents of 2 and 3 under simulated sunlight were measured by using a transverse double-probe device (Fig. S14, ESI†).34Fig. 4c shows that the dark current of the crystal optoelectronic device of 2 is very low (∼6 pA, at Vbias = 10 V). Under simulated sunlight, the photocurrent increases to 0.03 nA (at 10 V); the ratio of photocurrent to dark current can be estimated to be ∼5. This result indicates that the photoelectric performance of crystal 2 is not very good. In contrast, the dark current of crystal 3 is also very low 4 pA at a paranoid voltage of 10 V. As a very important attribute of the device reliability, this kind of low dark current will render the device higher detection capability.35 Moreover, the current of 3 significantly increased under light, and the ratio of photocurrent to dark current was about 30. In addition, with the increase of the incident power, the photocurrent showed a significant increase (Fig. S15, ESI†). As another important performance index of the detector, good stability can naturally broaden the application range of the device. Fig. S16 (ESI†) shows that the photocurrents do not show any obvious degradation after a long switching period, indicating that 3 exhibits excellent stability in terms of photoelectricity.

In conclusion, we have successfully synthesized three lead-free light-absorbing materials (bis-(2-dimethylaminoethyl) ether)Bi2I8 (1) (bis-(2-dimethylaminoethyl) ether)2IBi2I9 (2) and (bis-(2-dimethylaminoethyl) ether)3I3Bi3I14 (3) through an iodide management strategy, which had environmentally friendly features and realized the adjustable light absorption ability. In terms of light absorption, the band gap value 2.01 eV of 1 was successfully adjusted to 1.92 eV of 2 and 1.60 eV of 3. In particular, 3 has a good light absorption ability which shows a significant redshift of 137 nm compared with 1. In addition, the photoconductivity further proves that the I3− interlayer hybrid material has a good photoelectric application prospect. These results provide an effective way to insert I− or I3− groups into a variety of organic–inorganic hybrid materials and an iodide management strategy for the development of lead-free light-absorbing semiconductor materials.
