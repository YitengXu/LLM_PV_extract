    , Accepted 8th February 2012First published on 29th February 2012AbstractFlexible conductive threads were successfully fabricated on cheap insulating commercial thread substrates using a dip-coating method with conductive polymer PEDOT:PSS. The PEDOT:PSS improved the conductivity and catalytic performance of the threads. For the first time, threads were utilized to fabricate fiber-shaped dye-sensitized solar cells with 4.8% efficiency.
Recently, flexible/wearable electronics have been drawing more and more attention for their advantages in combined electronics and fabrics.1 Weaving using fiber electric devices as building blocks is one of the attractive potential methods for fabricating flexible and wearable electric devices.2 To date, fiber electronics have taken important steps forward,2–4 such as the successful fabrication of fiber sensors, fiber field-effect transistors, and fiber actors. However, some obstacles have been encountered, one of which is energy harvesting/storage because all energy-consuming devices need energy to maintain their normal electronic functions.5 Thus, fiber energy converters, such as thermoelectric converter,6 piezoelectric converter,7 and photoelectric converter,8,9 have been proposed to address the issues above.
Fiber electrodes play an important role as indispensable components to fiber devices in both collecting electron/hole carriers and loading functional materials. Excellent conductivity is a basic requirement and is desirable for fiber electrodes. Fiber electrodes should possess electrocatalytic performance aside from good flexibility, lightweight, and human/fiber interface comfortability for electrochemical devices, such as dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs).10–14 Metal wires are the most common fiber electrodes with good conductivity, however, their flexibility needs to be improved and their weight needs to be reduced. Considering the wide application of flexible, light, and comfortable natural or synthetic polymer fibers in the textile field, they would be ideal electrodes for wearable electronics if they are endowed with conductivity via surface modification with other conductive materials. Conductive polymer is especially suitable for modifying polymer fiber compared with metal and metal oxide inorganic conductive materials, because it shows better compatibility with a polymer fiber substrate.15 Thus, the all-polymer electrode could not only obtain good conductivity, but also preserve the physical and comfort properties of the fiber substrate. So far, the highest conductivity of 100 S cm−1 is achieved by coating PEDOT/PSS on the polyamide monofilament,16 while that of dip-coated conductive threads are less than 10 S cm−1.17
In the current study, all-polymer conductive threads were successfully prepared via dip-coating methods using a DMSO doping commercial PEDOT:PSS solution with a low-cost commercial and textile-used thread. The final conductive thread possessed good conductivity (109 S cm−1), catalytic performance to I−/I3− redox shuffler, and flexibility. Moreover, the conductive thread was used for the first time as a counter electrode for the fiber-shaped DSSC and showed good photovoltaic performance.
The commercial polyester threads used in the current study comprised 15 μm diameter high-oriented monofilaments that were twisted together. The thread loosened and the diameter was not well defined because of crude industrial technology. However, the PEDOT:PSS treatment improved the appearance of the conductive thread, as shown in Fig. 1. The monofilaments were adhered close together by PEDOT:PSS and formed a composite thread with a diameter of approximately 300 μm. The surface of the thread was well covered with the PEDOT:PSS film and the parallel veinlet on the film caused by the monofilaments undersurface was easily observed. The continuous and completed PEDOT:PSS film favors good conductivity. Fig. 1c and d show the cross-section SEM images of the conductive thread. The PEDOT:PSS conductive polymer bound the monofilaments together, and a conductive network, which enhanced the conductivity of the thread and increased the surface area of the conductive polymer, was formed inside the thread. Moreover, the PEDOT:PSS film surrounding the monofilaments was in the nanometres range, which was too thin to be determined using the current experimental instruments. However, the flexibility of the thread was preserved because of the thin but robust film. Therefore, the conductive thread could be bended or knotted, while the conductivity and mechanical properties sacrificed a little, which are the basic requirements for weaving the thread into textile electronics.3

The dipping–coating times could be used to easily adjust the PEDOT:PSS loading on the thread. The PEDOT:PSS loading was found to increase linearly with dipping–coating times, whereas the resistance of the thread linearly decreased, as shown in Fig. 2a. Only 0.316 mg of PEDOT:PSS per centimetre of the thread was observed when the thread was dipped 10 times. However, the resistance was reduced to 13 Ω cm−1, i.e., 109 S cm−1. The fabrication of the highly conductive threads is an important step in the fiber electronics field.18

Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was used to investigate the catalytic performance of the conductive threads to I−/I3−. Fig. 2b shows the CV curves of three conductive threads with different PEDOT:PSS loadings. Two couples of obvious redox current peaks show the high catalytic performance of the conductive thread ascribing to PEDOT modification. The I−/I3− and I2/I3− catalytic redox reactions caused the left and right peaks, respectively.19 The peak currents significantly increased when the PEDOT:PSS loading increased from 0.104 mg cm−1 to 0.206 mg cm−1, indicating that high loading improves catalytic performance. The peak currents slightly increased when the PEDOT:PSS loading was further increased to 0.316 mg cm−1. The surface area of the PEDOT:PSS reasonably produced a positive effect on the total catalytic surface and thus on the catalytic performance.20 The surface of the PEDOT on the thread will lightly increase after completely covering the surface of monofilaments using a special amount of PEDOT:PSS. However, further increase in PEDOT:PSS does not increase the surface.
Fifty continuous CV cycles were conducted in acetonitrile solution containing I−/I3− to validate the catalytic stability of the conductive thread (Fig. 2c). The curve of the 13th cycle had a lower redox current compared with the curve of the first CV cycle, indicating a strong interaction between the PEDOT:PSS and the components in the solution in the previous 13 cycles.22 However, the CV curves, including peak potential and current, were almost similar to one another in the following 37 cycles, demonstrating that the conductive thread had good electrochemical stability.

Fig. 2d shows the CV curves of the conductive thread at different scanning rates. The linear relationship between the peak current and square root of the scanning rate was obtained to explore the electrochemical dynamics process of the thread. According to results in the literature,21 the transport of I− on the surface of the conductive thread may have caused the redox species diffusion-limited process. The electrochemical properties described above show the potential application of conductive threads in DSSCs.
The fiber-shaped dye-sensitized solar cells were fabricated (as shown in Fig. 3a) using conductive threads as counter electrodes to illustrate their potential application in optic-electronics. Fig. 3b shows the photovoltaic performances of the solar cells and their parameters are summarized in Table 1. Using conductive thread loading of 0.104 mg cm−1 PEDOT:PSS, the corresponding device had the following good performances: open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit voltage (Jsc), filled factor (FF), and photoelectron conversion efficiency (PCE) reached 0.699 V, 11.3 mA cm−2, 0.56, and 4.46%, respectively. FF increased to 0.63 or 0.67 when the loading increased to 0.206 mg cm−1 or 0.316 mg cm−1, respectively, whereas Voc and Jsc had a slight change. The final PCE grew up to 4.54% or 4.82%, respectively. The results are comparable to those of DSSCs using platinized carbon fiber as counter electrodes.14 Our conductive polymer threads show both lower cost and better resistant to shear force than carbon fiber-based CEs.

The electrochemical impedance was determined in situ under dark condition to clarify the relationship between the conductive thread-based counter electrode and the device performance. Fig. 3c and d show the Nyquist curves of three devices with different PEDOT:PSS loadings. Each curve contained three arcs, including the left high-frequency arc corresponding to the electron transport process through the counter electrode/electrolyte interface, the middle arc corresponding to the carrier-recombining process through the photoanode/electrolyte interface, and the right low-frequency arc corresponding to the diffusion process of redox species in the electrolyte.23 The series ohm resistance of the device (Rs), the electron transport resistances of the counter electrode/electrolyte interface (RCE), and the carrier-recombined resistances of the counter electrode/electrolyte interface (RWE) were obtained via electrochemical circle fitting. The Rs and RCT of the devices using a conductive thread with 0.104 mg cm−1 of PEDOT:PSS were 218 and 19.2 Ω, respectively. According to the literature,24Rs and RCT, which have negative effects on FF, contribute to the total resistance of the device and thus to PCE. Low RCT is consistent with the good catalytic performance of the conductive thread. However, high Rs, which is mainly attributed to the high resistance of the conductive thread, is detrimental to device performance. The Rs greatly dropped to 77.1 Ω and the RCT also decreased to 15.0 Ω, when the PEDOT:PSS loading increased to 0.206 mg cm−1. Thus, small Rs and RCT could reduce the total series ohm resistance and then improve the FF. The Rs and RCT minimally dropped and thus the FF was improved, when the PEDOT:PSS loading was further increased to 0.316 mg cm−1.
The power output of the fiber DSSCs should be easy to adjust to satisfy different power-consuming wearable electronic devices. The illuminated area of the fiber DSSCs is proportional to device length. Moreover, the photovoltaic performances of the devices with different lengths were investigated, as shown in Fig. 4. The short-circuit current linearly increased with the device length, indicating that the desirable current output could easily be obtained by changing the device length. However, the Voc and FF slightly decreased mainly because of the series ohm resistance, leading to the decrease in PCE. The resistance of the conductive thread increased with length, thus, a larger voltage drop occurred at the counter electrode, leading to the lower Voc. The PCE of the 5.5 cm long fiber DSSC was maintained at 3.8%. To reduce the adverse effect of series ohm resistance on device performance, it is important to further improve the conductivity of the PEDOT:PSS film, which is our following work in future.

The conductivity of the conductive polymer PEDOT is highly dependent on its doping with organic molecule, such as the DMSO in the current study.25 Volatilizing or dissolving in solvent may result in changes in doped concentration, as well as in the conductivity of PEDOT, during staining via organic solvent or washing processes. The conductive threads were soaked in different solvents for a day and then dried to clarify their resistance to solvents. Water, acetonitrile, and liquid electrolyte containing I−/I3− were chosen for considering the actual environment and application in liquid-state DSSCs. The conductivity of the conductive threads sacrificed a little when treated with water and their conductivity dropped by approximately 10% and 20% when treated with acetonitrile and electrolyte, respectively. These results show that the current experimental conductive threads have good resistance to the solvents above and thus their high stability is key to their actual application in a complex environment.18 These conductive threads treated with solvents were further used to fabricate fiber DSSCs (4, 5, and 6) as described above. Fig. 5 shows the photovoltaic and electrochemical properties of the DSSCs. Device 4 had a higher filled FF (0.69) and PCE (5.18%) compared with device 3, whereas devices 5 and 6 had lower PCE (4.05% and 4.39%, respectively) because of lower Jsc and FF. The Voc of device 6 was larger by 40 mV than that of device 3, indicating the interaction between the redox species and the PEDOT changed the redox potential on the surface of the conductive thread.22

EIS was used to explain the effect of solvent treatment on the properties of counter electrodes and corresponding devices. The three phase peaks in the Bode plots (Fig. 5b) from right to left correspond to the electron transport process through the counter electrode/electrolyte interface, carrier recombination process photoanode/electrolyte interface and diffusion process in electrolyte, respectively. The right peak of devices 4, 5, and 6 slightly shifted to low frequency and shows that the characteristic time for electron transport increased compared with that of device 3, indicating a smaller electron transport speed through the PEDOT:PSS/electrolyte interface. The results have verified some changes in the electrochemical properties of the conductive threads after solvent treatment. Fig. 5c and d show the Nyquist plots of devices 3 to 5, and the corresponding parameters are summarized in Table 2. The order of Rs, from low to high, was devices 4, 1, 5, and 6, which is consistent with the resistance of the corresponding conductive threads. The RCE of devices 4, 5, and 6 increased to 21.4, 47.2, and 76.6 Ω, respectively, compared with device 3, indicating that the catalytic performances of the counter electrodes were weakened, probably because of the corrosion effects of the solvents, especially polar organic solvents, to the PEDOT:PSS film. The resistance of the PEDOT:PSS film to solvent could be improved by doping the conductive polymer with macromolecules, such as PEO, or via cross-linking, which will be the next study to be conducted.

All polymer conductive threads were successfully fabricated via dip-coating with commercial threads and PEDOT:PSS solution. It is a universal method to fabricate conductive threads on insulating thread substrates (such as cotton, wool, and silk threads) with other conductive polymers (such as polyaniline and polypyrrole). The good conductivity, catalytic performance, and stability of these conductive threads show their potential applications in electronic devices, especially in electrochemical devices. Moreover, these conductive threads are flexible and robust enough to be weaved into textiles.
