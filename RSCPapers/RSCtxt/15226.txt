    , Accepted 19th January 2011First published on 8th February 2011AbstractWe determine the fundamental iron oxide high solubility mechanism that drives a new electrolytic pathway to iron production, and eliminates a major CO2 emission source, for example it is produced using wind and solar energy, in a molten carbonate electrolyte, at a high rate and a low electrolysis energy.
The millennia old, greenhouse gas emitting, carbothermal process to form iron is responsible for 25% of all carbon dioxide globally released by industry.1 In this study, the first complete chemical mechanism and formalized procedure for a new hybrid CO2-free iron production process is demonstrated. Here we show that massive carbothermal greenhouse emissions due to iron production can be eliminated in a new hybrid wind–solar thermal electrochemical process. We had presented a solar energy driven pathway to eliminate anthropogenic carbon dioxide2–5 concurrent with an unexpected 3 molal (m) Fe(III) solubility in molten carbonate,2 even though iron oxides were previously considered as highly insoluble in carbonate media. Here, we probe the fundamental mechanism and species which drives this solubility. A 1∶1 ratio of ferric and lithium oxides is soluble in molten lithium carbonate with a several fold higher solubility than we previously reported (14 m Fe(III)), as formed directly from the pervasive iron ore, hematite Fe2O3, providing a facile path for iron electrolysis. The unusual, high solubility is accentuated by the low solubility of ferric oxides (ppm) which had previously been reported in molten carbonates.6 We show that lithiated Fe(III) is also soluble in molten carbonate mixes, such as a LixNayKzCO3 eutectic, which provide a wider operating temperature domain than the prior pure salt media.2Iron and oxygen are rapidly formed at a low energy and a high rate, without evolving CO2, and using readily available resources and materials.
Low carbonate melting points are achieved by a eutectic mix of alkali carbonates (TmpLi2CO3: 723 °C, Na2CO3: 851 °C, K2CO3: 891 °C, Li1.07Na0.93CO3: 499 °C, Li0.85Na0.61K0.54CO3: 393 °C). The corrosion product of iron containing alloys in lithium containing eutectic molten carbonates at 650 °C is LiFeO2. Of significance, this oxide has been reported as highly insoluble, with a solubility on the order of parts per million.6 Whereas iron oxide salts such as Fe2O3 and LiFeO2 were reported as highly insoluble in molten carbonates, we find here that Fe(III) salts are highly soluble in lithiated carbonates leading to a low energy pathway to eliminate CO2-free emissions in iron production.

Lithium oxide, as well as iron, iron oxides, such as hematite, remain solid to a very high temperature (each has a melting point above 1500 °C). However, solid Li2O dissolves in 400–1000 °C molten carbonates, and reacts rapidly with CO2(gas) (as detailed in the ESI†), in accord with the equilibrium: Li2O + CO2 ⇌ Li2CO3(1)
The distinct reaction products of the reaction of Fe2O3 and Li2CO3 have been recently characterized.7 Starting with either a 1∶1 or 5∶1 equivalent ratio of Fe2O3 to Li2CO3, the reactions proceed according to: T > 400 °C: Fe2O3 + Li2CO3 → 2LiFeO2 + CO2(2) T > 600 °C: Fe2O3 + 1/5Li2CO3 → 2/5LiFe5O8 + 1/5CO2(3)
Here, we report that significantly higher Fe(III) solubilities, on the order of 50 weight percent in molten carbonates, are achieved via the reaction of Li2O with Fe2O3, yielding an effective method for CO2 free iron production. Our preparation, solubility and electrolysis of MFe5O8 and MFeO2 salts from Fe2O3 are described here in the ESI.† We previously reported the dissolution in molten lithium carbonate of 20% ferric oxide by mass (3 molal Fe(III)),2 and did not examine higher concentrations or alternative alkali ferric oxides. In this study, following preparation of specific iron oxide salts, they are added to molten alkali carbonate. The Fe(III) solubility is similar when either LiFe5O8 or (Fe2O3 + Li2O) is added to the Li2CO3. As seen in Fig. 1, the solubility of Fe2O3 + Li2O is high and increases from 7.1 m at 750 °C to 14.0 m (moles of Fe(III) per kg carbonate solvent) in Li2CO3 at 950 °C.
 Fig. 1  The solubility of ferric oxides in alkali molten carbonates. 
The phase equilibria of the Fe–Na–O system have not yet been studied in detail, but as with the lithium analogues, the reaction of Fe2O3 and Na2CO3 has been reported to produce both NaFeO2 and NaFe5O8 products.8 As seen in Fig. 1, the solubility of the analogous sodium system NaFe5O8 in Na2CO3 remains substantially lower (≪1 wt %) than lithiated ferric oxide even at 950 °C. Fe2O3, NaFe5O8, NaFeO2, KFe5O8 or KFeO2 solubility is insignificant (≪1 wt %) in either molten Na2CO3 or K2CO3. However as seen, the solubility of (Li2O + Fe2O3) in the alkali carbonate eutectic, Li0.87Na0.63K0.50CO3, is high, and at 750 °C approaches half the solubility of that in the pure lithium carbonate electrolyte. The eutectic has the distinction of a greater molten temperature range (extending several hundred degrees lower than the pure lithium system). Solubility of this lithiated ferric oxide in the LixNayKzCO3 mixes provides an alternative molten medium for iron production which, compared to pure lithium carbonate, has the disadvantage of lower conductivity,2 but the advantage of even greater availability and a wider operating temperature domain. Also as evident in the figure, while the solubility of the lithiated ferric oxide in the eutectic carbonate is high, the solubility of a mixed alkali penta-iron octa-oxide salt, synthesized as Li0.435Na0.315K0.250Fe5O8, is low, reaching a maximum concentration of only 0.5 m Fe(III) at 950 °C.
As delineated in the ESI†, the addition of a 1∶1 equivalent ratio of Li2O to Fe2O3 dissolves in Li2CO3 without the reactive formation of CO2 (CO2 forms when pure Fe2O3 or LiFe5O8 are dissolved) to a steady state of LiFeO2 and is summarized in eqn (I). This is of particular significance to the electrolysis of Fe2O3 in molten carbonate. As this is reduced to iron metal, Li2O is released (LiFeO2 → Fe + 1/2Li2O + 1/2O2) facilitating the continued eqn (I) dissolution of Fe2O3 without CO2 release, and without a change in the electrolyte, or more concisely, iron production viahematite in lithium carbonate is given by eqn (I) and (II):Iron production: Li2O unchanged (I + II): Fe2O3 → 2Fe + 3/2O2 Dissolution in molten carbonate: Fe2O3 + Li2O → 2LiFeO2(I) Electrolysis, Li2O regeneration: 2LiFeO2 → 2Fe + Li2O + 3/2O2(II)

Fig. 2 summarizes the thermochemical calculated potentials constraining iron production in molten carbonate. Thermodynamically it is seen that at a higher potential, steel (iron containing carbon) may be directly formed via the concurrent reduction of CO2, which we observe in the lithium carbonate electrolyte at a higher electrolysis potential,5 a process that will be delineated in an expanded study, as Li2CO3 → C + Li2O + O2, followed by carbonate regenerationviaeqn (1), to yield by electrolysis in molten carbonate:Steel production: Fe2O3 + xCO2 → 2FeCx/2 + (3/2 + x)O2

From the kinetic perspective, a higher concentration of dissolved iron oxide improves mass transport to the cathode to sustain a larger source of iron available for reduction. This decreases the electrolysis overpotential and permits higher steady-state current densities of iron production. An increase in oxidized iron in the molten electrolyte solution will also substantially decrease the thermodynamic energy needed for the reduction to iron metal. In the electrolyte Fe(III) originates from dissolved ferric oxides, such as LiFeO2 or LiFe5O8. The potential for the three electron reduction to iron varies in accord with the general Nerstian expression, for a concentration [Fe(III)], at activity coefficient, α: EFe(III/0) = E°Fe(III/0) + (RT/nF) log(αFe(III) [Fe(III)])1/3(4)
This decrease in electrolysis potential with increasing Fe(III) varies as 6.6 × 10−5 V × T(electrolysis, K)/K (=RT/nF), which is accentuated by high temperature. Hence, from the thermodynamic perspective with a simple assumption of unit activity coefficient, a 14 molal iron concentration will decrease the 1223 K (950 °C) electrolysis potential by a further 0.1 V in eqn (4). A higher activity coefficient, αFe(III) > 1, would further decrease the thermodynamic potential to produce iron.
The measured electrolysis potential is presented in Fig. 3 for dissolved Fe(III) in molten lithium carbonate, and is low. For example 0.7 V sustains a current density of 500 mA cm−2 in 14 m Fe(III) in Li2CO3 at 950 °C, which is considerably less than the previous 1.6 V needed to drive the electrolysis at this current in 3 m Fe(III) at 800 °C.2 Higher temperature lowers the energy needed for electrolysis, and the higher concentrations accessed in this study result in energy savings. As expected, the measured potentials are considerably less than the room temperature 1.3 V thermodynamic potential required to convert Fe2O3 to iron and oxygen. When an external source of heat, such as solar thermal, is available then the energy savings over room temperature iron electrolysis are considerable. The high activity of the dissolved iron (up to 14 m) in hot lithiated carbonate facilitates charge transfer and decreases the iron electrolysis voltage.

The surface area is cathode constrained. The cell contains excess anode surface area and the full cell electrolysis potentials are measured as a function of constant current, with current density constrained by the cathode surface area. 
In this study, in addition to a demonstration of a path to a 14 m iron solubility resulting in substantially lower iron production energy, a new solar/wind Hybrid Solar Thermal Electrochemical Production (Hy-STEP) iron electrolysis process is demonstrated. High temperature substantially lowers the energy needed to drive the electrolysis and increases the STEP system efficiency (ESI†).
As shown in Fig. 4, in Hy-STEP, the electronic energy is driven by a wind turbine and concentrated sunlight is only used to provide heat to decrease the energy required for iron splitting. In this process, sunlight is concentrated to provide effective heating of the molten salt, but is not split into separate spectral regions as in our previous STEP system.2–5 Components we use in the Hy-STEP iron production are described in the ESI†, and iron production measured with one or two in-series 14 molal Fe(III) molten Li2CO3 electrolysis cells is included in Fig. 4. As reported in our preceding study,2iron metal is produced. Steel (iron containing carbon) may be directly formed via the concurrent reduction of CO2, as will be delineated in an expanded study. Optimal matching of the maximum point power of the solar heat, wind electronic, and electrolysis cell components of the system is in progress, and will also be reported in a later study. This communication focuses on novel aspects of the iron electrolysis cell, while the remaining wind (electric) and solar thermal (to T > 1000 °C) components of Hy-STEP iron are mature technologies as described in the ESI.†
 Fig. 4  The wind/solar thermal production of carbon dioxide free iron. In this Hy-STEP process concentrated sunlight heats, and wind energy drives electronic transfer into the electrolysis chamber. The thermodynamic and kinetic energy required to electrolyze iron oxide, to iron and oxygen, is lower at higher temperature. The wind powered electrolysis energy required is further diminished due to the high solubility of iron oxide in specific carbonates, such as Li2CO3. Bottom: iron is produced at a high current density and a low energy in 14 m Fe2O3 + 14 m Li2O dissolved in molten Li2CO3. 
A mechanism is determined for the unexpected solubility, and low energy electrolysis, of iron oxides in lithium carbonate electrolytes. The facile charge transfer, coupled with a sharp decrease in iron electrolysis potentials, enables a new route for the hybrid solar thermal electrochemical production of iron. The formation of iron is exemplified, driven by solar thermal and wind electronic energy, without release of CO2 in a process compatible with the predominant naturally occurring iron oxide ore, hematite, Fe2O3.
