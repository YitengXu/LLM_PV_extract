    , Accepted 26th December 2022First published on 26th December 2022AbstractAnisotropy in a crystal structure plays a striking role in determining the optical, electrical and thermal properties of the condensed matter. Here, we investigated in-plane vibrational anisotropy in a two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW)-layered GeAs narrow-gap semiconductor by combining microstructural characterization and polarization Raman spectroscopy. Interestingly, not only the intensities but also the Raman shifts in all modes evolved periodically with different symmetries as the polarization angle changed continuously, which could be well-analyzed using the Raman tensors and further interpreted from the phonon dispersion relations. More importantly, the temperature-dependent Raman intensities of the Raman modes in the range from 83 K to 823 K gave a thermal-related uniform constant, based on which key parameters, including the thermal expansion coefficient, Grüneisen constant and quasi-particle lifetime, could be directly derived, which were in line with the calculated predictions. This investigation provides a comprehensive understanding of structure-dependent optical anisotropy in 2D vdW-layered GeAs and suggests a new idea for exploring the thermal properties of related materials using temperature-dependent Raman spectroscopy.
I. Introduction
The Group IV–V compound GeAs, a typical two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW)-layered narrow-gap semiconductor, has attracted much attention due to its potential applications in micro/nano photonic and electronic devices. Experimentally, 2D GeAs layered nanoflakes have been synthesized by vapor growth or liquid-phase exfoliation methods,1,2 and the number of layers can be monitored by a method based on a simple oxidation etching process.3 The theoretical bandgap (Eg) of GeAs has been found to be widely tunable from 0.83 eV (bulk) to 2.07 eV (monolayer),4 suggesting it to be a promising visible-infrared detection material or solar cell absorption layer candidate. In 2018, Bartolomeo et al.5 used exfoliated multilayer GeAs as the channel in back-gate field-effect transistors. Later, Liu et al.6 discovered that its superconductivity was strongly dependent on the structure after performing high-pressure experiments on GeAs. Recently, Dalsaniya et al.7 explored the layered type-II GeAs/GaSe heterostructure as a suitable candidate for solar cells, which achieved a power conversion efficiency of ∼22.32% at 4% tensile strain. More intriguingly, GeAs presents unique optical, electrical and thermal anisotropies, which have led to unusual device applications that are not possible with isotropic materials,8e.g., in polarization sensors, polarization spectroscopy imaging, optical radar and remote sensing,9 which are based on the high conduction ratio and dichroic ratio of anisotropic crystals. For instance, regarding the in-plane anisotropic properties of GeAs, Yang et al.10 have investigated the thickness, excitation wavelength, and polarization dependences of the Raman intensity anisotropy both experimentally and theoretically. Zhou et al.4 built a GeAs-based photodetector with rapid on/off response and excellent polarization-sensitive photoresponse properties originating from the in-plane optical anisotropy of GeAs. However, from the point of view of applications in polarization-related optoelectronics and thermoelectric-related devices, it is essential that the key parameters, including anisotropy-dependent Raman shifts, temperature-involved Grüneisen constant γ, derived phonon lifetime τ and even thermal expansion coefficient, are directly determined experimentally, for instance, by the variable-conditional Raman spectroscopy, especially since Lee et al.11 experimentally discovered that doped GeAs can be a remarkable thermoelectric material, with a thermoelectric figure of merit ZT value of 0.35 at 660 K.
Herein, we have investigated the in-plane anisotropy in 2D vdW-layered GeAs by temperature-dependent polarization Raman spectroscopy at different geometric configurations. In combination with the microstructural characterization techniques, including high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD), we have found that not only the intensity but also the shifts in the Raman vibration modes of the 2D layered GeAs show evident polarization angle-dependence with different periodicities, as interpreted from the Raman tensor and the k-dependent dispersion relations of phonons, respectively. The temperature-dependent Raman intensities of all the active modes were in the range from 83 K to 823 K, revealing a multiple-phonon coupling process, based on which the thermoelectric parameters, including the thermal expansion coefficient and Grüneisen constant, could be derived. The investigation provides a comprehensive insight into structure-dependent optical anisotropy and suggests an effective strategy for revealing the thermal properties of 2D GeAs based on temperature-dependent Raman spectroscopy.
II. Experimental details
The cross-section TEM specimens were prepared by a dual-beam focused ion beam (FIB) system (Helios G4 UX, FEI, USA) using Ga-ion accelerating voltage ranging from 2 to 30 kV to remove the residual amorphous layer. Atomic-resolution imaging was performed on an aberration-corrected TEM (JEOL Grand ARM300, Japan). To improve the signal-to-noise ratio and minimize the drift or distortion of the AC-HAADF-STEM images, six serial frames were acquired with a short dwell time (2 μs pixel−1). The image series was aligned and superimposed. The XRD patterns were obtained on a Bruker D8 Advance instrument (with Cu Kα radiation, λ = 1.54 Å).
The Raman spectra were recorded on an inVia Reflex micro-Raman system with a backscattering configuration. A 532-nm linearly polarized laser was used as the excitation source, and the laser output intensity was set at ∼0.1 kW cm−2 order of magnitude to avoid excitation-induced degradation of the samples. Different polarization geometries between the incident and scattered beams, including parallel and cross configurations, were employed. During measurements, a linear polarizer was added to the optical path before the detector and could be rotated continuously. The samples were mounted on the head of a temperature-variable system, which allowed for temperature tunability from ∼83 K to 823 K.
III. Results and discussions
As shown in Fig. 1(a), in terms of atomic structure, 2D vdW-layered GeAs was monoclinic and belonged to the C2/m low-symmetry space group (JCPDS card no. 11-0524, a = 15.59 Å, b = 3.792 Å, c = 9.49 Å, β = 101.28 Å2). The primitive cell of GeAs consisted of 12 Ge atoms and 12 As atoms. Every Ge atom (red balls) coordinated with three As atoms and another Ge atom, while every As atom (blue balls) coordinated with three Ge atoms. Each monolayer GeAs was in turn composed of As–Ge–Ge–As and interacted with the neighboring layers via weak vdW forces.12 The XRD pattern of GeAs (Fig. 1b) with obvious {20} reflections indicated that the single-crystal GeAs had grown along the (20) planes. In addition, the atomic images further showed that the 〈01〉 out-of-plane growth orientation was normal to the vdW gap, which is in line with the XRD result. The totally different atomic arrangements (Fig. 1c and d) of Ge and As along the armchair and zigzag directions of GeAs demonstrated obvious in-plane structural anisotropy, which may lead to anisotropic optical properties.

Fig. 2 gives the polarization angle (θ)-dependent Raman spectra of GeAs in the parallel (XX) and perpendicular (XY) configurations, where X, Y and Z correspond to the crystal-axis directions of the b, c and a axes, respectively. The peaks at 92, 104, 145, 172, 271, 281, and 305 cm−1 belong to the Ag modes, and those at 57, 75, 85, 241, and 254 cm−1 belong to the Bg modes.4 In both Z(X, X) and Z(X, Y) configurations, the intensity of these modes presented evident θ-dependence, as summarized in Fig. S1 (ESI†) in a polar coordinate. It is obvious that the intensities of these modes had different periodicities (90° or 180°) in the parallel and perpendicular configurations. Notably, the directions of the maximum and minimum of the polar coordinate aligned with the armchair and zigzag directions, respectively.4 According to classical Placzek approximation,13 the Raman intensity (I) values could be fitted well based on the relationship shown in Table S1 (ESI†), most of which are in line with the experimental data. In the perpendicular configuration, sub-maxima occurred between the two maxima at 92, 172, and 281 cm−1 due to anisotropic optical absorption and the birefringence effect.14 As for the slight angle deviation of the 57 cm−1 mode in the polar plot compared with the other modes in the perpendicular configuration, this may be due to the uneven surface of the sample impeding the laser beam from perpendicularly striking the surface.

Interestingly, in addition to peak intensity, as shown in Fig. 2, some Raman shifts also exhibited periodical θ-dependence, e.g., the modes at 75 and 254 cm−1 in the parallel configuration and those at 75, 254, and 271 cm−1 in the perpendicular configuration, which are shown in Fig. 3. Since the excitation density of the laser was relatively low, it would exclude the excitation-induced extrinsic effect; thus, such anomalous θ-dependent Raman shift behavior of the vibration modes should be intrinsic and may be understood based on optical phonon branch dispersion in the reciprocal space. As shown in Fig. 4(a), the excitation point on the sample, where the incident laser hits, should correspond to the high-symmetry point in the reciprocal space in the normal incident configuration. The schematic of GeAs in-plane rotation is shown in Fig. 4(b). However, due to the idiographic crystal structure in monoclinic GeAs (C2/m), the incident point is not strictly at the origin of the first Brillouin zone (point A) when the sample is rotated by one circle, i.e., the point slipping on the optical phonon branch, and thus the polar coordinate map has a polarization angle-dependent shift with a sub-maximum value (point A′). Therefore, the Raman shift exhibits a 4-lobe variation when the polarization angle is rotated. Generally, the function of the optical phonon branch involving the vibration frequency (ω, i.e., the Raman shift) and wave vector (q) can be expressed as follows. (1)where f is the force constant for the quasi-elastic force between adjacent atoms, M1 and M2 are the masses of two adjacent atoms, and N is the lattice period. The frequency range of the optical phonon branch can be expressed as (2)Based on this equation, we can infer that the ratio of its maximum to minimum is a constant, i.e., . However, the ratios of the maximum and minimum of these Raman shifts were different (Table 1). That is, the extreme value in the polar coordinate map did not correspond with the extreme value in the optical phonon branch.

Intriguingly, the ratios of both modes 75 cm−1 and 254 cm−1 in the two configurations had a similar value, suggesting that the degree of the point slipping on the optical phonon branch may be a function of the vibration frequency. Similar results have also been reported in a strained semiconductor structure and an anisotropic LiNbO3 single crystal.15,16

Fig. 5 shows the Raman spectra of GeAs at different temperatures from 83 K to 823 K without the analyzer. It is obvious that the peak intensities for all modes were weakened when the temperature increased. This is caused by the decrease in the number of phonons in the ground state as the temperature increases (or softening of phonons). The observable redshift and broadening of the Raman peaks to different degrees are generally related to the interaction between anharmonic phonons, electron–phonon coupling or thermal expansion.17

A detailed analysis of the temperature dependence of the Raman shift was performed, as shown in Fig. 6. Only the strong nine peaks were listed for the analysis since the others were very weak in intensity. In the temperature range from 83 K to 823 K, the Raman shifts of all modes presented linear dependence, which can be described by the following expression, ω(T) = ω1 + χT(3)where ω1 is the Raman shift at absolute zero, and χ is the first-order temperature coefficient. Related reports have disclosed that the parameter, χ, for 2D materials is related to the vdW force between adjacent layers.17,18 In Fig. 6(a), it can be clearly seen that different modes have different temperature coefficients, representing variation in the influence of the interlayer vdW force on different vibration modes. Based on eqn (3), the differential expression for the temperature-dependence of the Raman shift could be derived as shown below,19,20 Δω = χΔT = (χT + χV)ΔT(4)where χT is the “self-energy” as a result of the “intrinsic” temperature effect, and χV is the shift that is influenced by thermal expansion. Compared with other semiconductor materials, GeAs has low thermal conductivity (12.6 W m−1 K−1 for the in-plane direction and 0.38 W m−1 K−1 for the out-of-plane direction21) but a high volume expansion coefficient,22 which suggests that χV has a major influence on Δω. Thus, eqn (4) can be simplified as, Δω = χVΔT(5)Importantly, we found that the χ-values of all modes exhibited a linear relationship with the Raman shift, giving a slope of S ≈ −6.75 × 10−5 K−1, as seen in Fig. 6(b). This value conceptionally gives a unique thermal expansion-related coefficient. However, the χ-parameter is related to the Grüneisen constant γ as shown below:23 (6)where V and ωi are the volume of the sample and the frequency of a specified mode (i), respectively. A large γ-value represents a strong phonon–phonon interaction, reflecting strong phonon anharmonicity due to low thermal conductivity.24 This equation can be re-expressed as (7)where β is the volume expansion coefficient. According to the Grüneisen relation, γi can also be described as,25 (8)where the bulk modulus  is the reciprocal of the compression ratio, CV (24.9 J mol−1 K−1) is the constant volume specific heat,26 and Vm is the molar volume with the unit of m3 mol−1. Then, (9)This equation correlates β with the experimental constant S, bulk modulus, constant volume specific heat and molar volume. The Young's modulus for bulk GeAs is ∼1.30 × 1011 Pa,27 based on which B can be calculated as , where the Poisson's ratio μ = 0.3 for GeAs.28 The molar volume Vm was physically obtained from the molar mass of GeAs (147.56 g mol−1) by dividing it by the density of GeAs (4.81 g cm−3),29 which gave the value of Vm ∼ 3.07 × 10−5 m3 mol−1. Subsequently, the calculated β-value in our work was about 2.25 × 10−5 K−1. Notably, a close value for constant β = 2 × 10−5 K−1 has also been reported for GeAs in the temperature range of 100–500 K.22 Then, the γ-value for GeAs was further calculated to be ∼3, which is significantly larger than those of conventional thermoelectric materials (e.g., γ = 1–2). This relatively high γ-value suggests the low thermal conductivity of GeAs.

Besides the redshift of Raman peaks, the full width at half-maximum (Γ) of the Raman peaks at different temperatures, as shown in Fig. 7, also provided information for deriving thermal parameters. Based on the phonon lifetime extracted from the Raman active optical-phonon mode of GeAs, we could estimate the quasi-particle lifetime τ of optical phonon in accordance with the equation, , where c is the speed of light.30 The Γ-value of GeAs was experimentally varied from 5 to 13 cm−1, resulting in τ values ranging from 0.41 to 1.06 ps. Approximately, this value can be assumed as the thermal transport relaxation time τT in the phenomenological expression for evaluating the thermal conductivity,23 (10)where CV, τT and  are the heat capacity under constant volume, the thermal transport relaxation time, and the averaged acoustic phonon velocity, respectively. The  value for general materials is about 5 km s−1.31 Then, the thermal conductivity of GeAs was estimated as ∼6.81 to 17.6 W m−1 K−1. The average of these two values is ∼12.2 W m−1 K−1, which is very close to the experimentally reported in-plane conductivity value of ∼12.6 W m−1 K−1 for GeAs.21

IV. Conclusions
In summary, the structure and optical anisotropies of a 2D GeAs semiconductor were systematically studied by polarization-dependent Raman spectroscopy at different geometric configurations and temperatures. The Raman intensities of the vibration modes exhibited different polarization dependencies in both parallel and perpendicular polarization configurations, which are in good agreement with the calculated results. More importantly, the observed periodic evolution of the Raman shift with polarization angles was well explained by the crystal structure and the phonon dispersion relation, e.g., due to the non-zero incident angle between the laser and the surface of monoclinic GeAs. This discovery suggests that we cannot simply determine a certain vibration mode based on a certain value and also provides an interpretation for the wavenumber inconsistency of some Raman vibration modes of GeAs determined experimentally. In addition, the temperature-dependent Raman results provided the first-order temperature coefficient χ for each vibration mode, the Grüneisen constant, the quasi-particle lifetime, and especially, a uniform constant of S (∼−6.75 × 10−5 K−1), which is related to the thermal expansion coefficient and constant volume specific heat, revealing the low thermal conductivity of GeAs. The intrinsic relationship of the S-value with the thermal parameters (volume expansion coefficient β, bulk modulus B, constant volume specific heat CV and the molar volume Vm) obtained from temperature-dependent Raman spectroscopy provide a new idea for exploring the thermal properties of related materials.
