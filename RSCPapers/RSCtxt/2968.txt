    , Accepted 3rd December 2014First published on 3rd December 2014AbstractIn this paper, the ZrO2:Fe nanostructures with precisely controlled Fe doping contents are obtained by using a template method. The characterizations obviously show that the as-prepared samples have hollow sphere-like morphology and high crystalline quality. Furthermore, the band gap of the ZrO2:Fe nanostructures is facilely tunable by controlling the Fe content. In addition, the density-functional theory (DFT) calculation reveals that the formation of an impurity band in the band gap narrows the band gap of the Fe-doped ZrO2 nanostructures. The visible-light driven photocatalytic activity of ZrO2 nanostructures could be remarkably enhanced by doping the Fe impurity. This can be attributed to the red shift of the absorption edge and the trapping effect of the ZrO2:Fe nanostructures. The research results provide a general and effective method to synthesize different photocatalysts with enhanced visible-light driven H2 evolution activity.
1. Introduction
Nowadays, energy shortage is an extremely serious problem. As one of the most valid and promising techniques, semiconductor photocatalysis utilizing solar energy or artificial indoor illumination to produce H2 has received widespread attention.1–4 One key challenge responsible for the slow progress of photocatalytic hydrogen production is the lack of suitable photocatalysts due to the stringent requirements for their intrinsic properties, such as wide-range absorption, high carrier mobility, long carrier lifetime, high stability, and environmental friendliness. As is well known, a single semiconductor cannot satisfy all the requirements of a good photocatalyst for water splitting as mentioned above. Developing junction material systems with synergic benefits from individuals is of great significance. Formation of heterojunctions at the nanoscale can further optimize the performance of photocatalysts.5–7 Furthermore, the hybrid system needs many photocatalysis materials, which have the conduction band minimum (CBM) and valence band maximum (VBM) in a variety of energy levels to create bandstructure matched hybrid composites. In order to improve the visible-light-driven photocatalytic water splitting, the materials forming the heterojunctions should satisfy two needs: a CBM negative enough to generate H2 and a bandgap narrow enough to absorb visible light. However, up to now, most of the photocatalysts have generally either low energy level of the CBM or wide bandgap, which cannot create bandstructure matched junction material systems effectively.2,7 Thus, the need for materials with high energy level CBM and narrow bandgap is urgent in the hybrid photocatalysis areas. Zirconium oxide (ZrO2) is an n-type semiconductor, which has high energy level of CBM.5,8 Because of the high energy level of CBM, ZrO2 has been used in a variety of technological fields such as fuel cell electrolyte, H2 generation, persistent organic pollutants degradation and gate dielectric.8–11 However, as a wide band-gap (5.0 eV) semiconductor, ZrO2 can only be excited for photocatalysis under UV-light irradiation and it limits the application of ZrO2 in visible-light-driven photocatalysis. Therefore, it is of great interest to reduce the bandgap of ZrO2 while maintaining the energy level of CBM. The band gap of ZrO2 could be effectively reduced by doping various elements. A variety of metal elements, such as Cr, Mn, Fe, Co and Ni, have been applied to tune the band gap and improve the photocatalytic performance of ZrO2.12–15 However, due to the hybridization of the atomic orbital, almost all of the metal dopants in ZrO2 would reduce the energy level of CBM. Thus, tremendous efforts should be placed in bandgap narrowing engineering of ZrO2.
In this work, through the first principle calculation, we found that the interstitial Fe could narrow the bandgap of ZrO2 by creating a new valance band in the band gap of ZrO2 while maintaining the energy level of CBM. Then, we presented a novel and simple method for preparing the ZrO2:Fe nanostructures with the assistance of carbon colloidal spheres, and the interstitial Fe were obtained by controlling the crystal structure of ZrO2. The ZrO2:Fe nanostructure is a visible-light-driven photocatalyst with high energy level of CBM, which has been successfully applied to produce H2 through a visible-light driven water-splitting process.
2. Experimental
2.1. Computational details
All the calculations were carried out by using the density functional theory (DFT) based on the commercial version of the software package CASTEP (Cambridge Sequential Total Energy Package), which could offer the vibrational properties of adsorption and accurate calculations of energy. The exchange–correlation effects and core electrons were taken into account via the generalized gradient approximation (GGA-PBE). We considered Fe doping effects by using a 1 × 1 × 2 cubic supercell (8 Zr atoms and 16 O atoms) and substituted one Zr atom by a Fe atom, resulting in a 12.5% Fe concentration. All the plane waves kinetic energy cut-off were set to be 340 eV. The mechanical equilibrium was accomplished by conjugate gradient minimization of the forces to a tolerance of 5 × 10−2 eV Å−1, the atomic positions to a tolerance of 2 × 10−3 Å, and the total energy to a tolerance of 2 × 10−6 eV.
2.2. Materials' synthesis
The carbon spheres were hydrothermally synthesized by adopting the method reported by Y. Li et al.16,17 To prepare the ZrO2:Fe nanostructures, zirconium nitrate (Zr(NO3)4, 1 mmol) and a stoichiometric amount of iron(III) nitrate nonahydrate (Fe(NO3)3·9H2O) were dissolved in 100 mL of N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF). Then, the as-prepared carbon spheres (50 mg) were added to the above solution, and the solution was sonicated for 30 min. Then, the as-obtained mixture solution was stirred at room temperature for 24 h. The precipitate was filtered, rinsed with deionized water and ethanol for several times, and then dried in an oven in air at 80 °C for 2 h. The ZrO2:Fe nanostructures were obtained by calcinating the products in air at 400 °C for 6 h. The continuously variable concentrations of Fe in ZrO2:Fe nanostructures could be attempted by controlling the molar ratio of Zr(NO3)4 and Fe(NO3)3·9H2O (Zr4+/Fe3+ = 1:0.05, 1:0.1, 1:0.15) in the solution. Pure ZrO2 nanostructures have also been prepared for comparison. The Pt/ZrO2:Fe photocatalyst was prepared by a two step method. After adding 1.5 wt% chloroplatinic acid and 40 mg ZrO2:Fe hollow spheres into 20 mL deionized water, the solution was put under ultraviolet light (254 nm) LED for 10 hours. Then, the Pt/ZrO2:Fe catalyst was obtained by filtering the solution and drying the sediment.
2.3. Materials' characterization
For the elemental analyses, ICP-AAS measurements were performed by using an atomic absorption spectrometer after digesting the ZrO2:Fe nanostructures in concentrated nitric acid (a 50% HNO3 solution). The crystallographic structure of the as-prepared photocatalysts was characterized by the powder X-ray diffraction. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM; S-4800, Hitachi) was used to identify the morphology of the samples. TEM was conducted using a JEOL JEM 1230 transmission electron microscope operated at 80 kV and a Philips CM 200 microscope operated at 160 kV. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were recorded in KBr dispersion in the range of 340–4000 cm−1. The optical properties were tested on a Shimadzu UV3600 ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometer. The XPS spectra were recorded on a Thermo ESCALAB-250 spectrometer by using a monochromatic Al Kα radiation source (1486.6 eV). The binding energies determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were corrected according to the adventitious carbon peak (285.0 eV) for each sample.
2.4. Photocatalytic reactions
Photocatalytic reactions were tested in Labsolar-II system (Beijing Perfectlight Technology Co., Ltd.) and He was used as a carrier gas. Photo-reduction of H+ to H2 in the presence of a sacrificial electron donor (methanol) was examined as test reactions. H2 evolution reactions were investigated using 100 mL of a 10 vol% aqueous methanol solution containing 40 mg of Pt/ZrO2:Fe. The 300 W xenon lamp was fitted with a cutoff filter (λ > 420 nm) and the photo-energy was 184 mW cm−2. The reaction started without mechanical stirring and the catalyst powder formed sediment on the bottom of the reaction cell. The solution was maintained at room temperature by a water bath system. The evolved gases were analyzed by gas chromatography.
2.5. Quantum efficiency
The H2 evolution quantum efficiency of the Pt/ZrO2:Fe was determined in this research. The experimental condition was the same as the photocatalytic reactions except that a 300 W xenon lamp was attached with a band pass filter (λ = 440 nm ± 10 nm). The quantum efficiency was calculated by using the following equation: Φ (%) = (2 × R/I) × 100, where Φ is the quantum efficiency, R and I represent the number of evolved gas molecules and the number of incident photons, respectively. The power of the light irradiation was measured by using a thermopile, which was located at the bottom of the reaction cell and the power of the light irradiation in the reaction cell was estimated to 21.6 mW. We assumed the average energy of photons was 2.82 eV (λ = 440 nm ± 10 nm); thus, the number of the incident photons in 10 hours was 1.65 × 1021, which could be deemed as I. The total H2 evolution was 2.36 μmol under the above-mentioned power in 10 hours. Therefore, the total number of evolved H2 molecules was 1.42 × 1018 (R) and the Φ was 0.17% after the calculation.
3. Results and discussions
We first investigated the atomic and electronic properties of ZrO2 and Fe-doped ZrO2 by using the first-principles calculation. The Fe-doped ZrO2 used for the simulation were as follows: one was the Fe cations that were entering the regular Zr sites as substitutional dopants (Fig. 1a, ZrO2:Fes), and the other one was Fe ions filling an interstitial position of the cubic zirconia (Fig. 1b, ZrO2:Fei). The total density of states (TDOS) of pure ZrO2 and ZrO2:Fes are shown in Fig. 1c, and it indicates that the Fe substitutional dopants produced a tiny band tail state near the valence band edge of ZrO2 and a new conduction band in the bandgap of ZrO2. Thus, the narrow bandgap of ZrO2:Fes was produced by reducing its CBM. On the other hand, for the interstitial system, Fig. 1d also shows a clear bandgap narrowing in the TDOS of the ZrO2:Fei compared with the undoped ZrO2. Moreover, unlike the bandgap narrowing mechanism of ZrO2:Fes, we found that the bandgap narrowing resulted from creating a new valence band in the bandgap of the ZrO2:Fei rather than reducing the CBM.
 Fig. 1  (a) and (b) are the calculated crystal structures of ZrO2:Fes and ZrO2:Fei. (c) and (d) are the calculated total density of state (TDOS) of ZrO2:Fes and ZrO2:Fei. ZrO2:Fes and ZrO2:Fei represent that the Fe dopant is doped in substitutional and interstitial position, respectively. 
To clarify the bandgap narrowing mechanism of Fe doped ZrO2, the density of states of specific elements are shown in Fig. 2. In the Fe doped ZrO2 system, the d orbit of Fe was split under a different crystal field. Because of the hexahedron field, the Fe in the substitutional site left the empty d splitting band in the bandgap of ZrO2 (Fig. 2a). Meanwhile, the O atoms, which were adjacent to the Fe atoms, also had a splitting tendency on its p orbits and the empty p orbit also had a contribution to the new empty band (Fig. 2b). Thus, the bandgap narrowing of ZrO2:Fes was caused by reducing the CBM of ZrO2:Fes through the creation of a new conduction band. Contrastively, when the Fe dopant was located at the interstitial site, the octahedral field made the full d band be pinned in the bandgap of ZrO2, and the empty p orbit of O elements vanished in the bandgap (Fig. 2c and d). Therefore, the bandgap narrowing of ZrO2:Fei was caused by creating a new valence band while maintaining the high energy level of CBM.
 Fig. 2  (a) and (b) are the partial density of states (PDOS) of Fe and O in ZrO2:Fes. (c) and (d) are the PDOS of Fe and O in ZrO2:Fei. 
Based on the calculation results, the band-energy diagram of the pure ZrO2 and the two types of Fe doped ZrO2, are described in Fig. 3. From the diagram, we could find the energy level of the CBM and VBM of pure ZrO2 significantly exceeding the redox potential of H+/H2 (0 V vs. NHE) and O2/H2O (1.23 V). In the ZrO2:Fes, the CBM was reduced from −1.0 eV to 1.5 eV so that the bandgap of the ZrO2:Fes was narrowed by approximately 2.5 eV compared with undoped ZrO2. The decrease of bandgap for ZrO2:Fes could extend the light adsorption of ZrO2 from the ultraviolet to visible light region. However, due to the low CBM energy level, the ZrO2:Fes were not sensitive for H2 generation. In comparison, for the ZrO2:Fei system, a new valence band appeared in the bandgap of the ZrO2. In other words, the interstitial Fe atoms could not only decrease the bandgap of ZrO2 but also maintain the high CBM energy level of ZrO2. Thus, the ZrO2:Fei system could be active for H2 generation under visible light.

From the reports of Ghigna et al.,18 we knew that the crystal structure of ZrO2 was the key to obtaining the interstitial Fe dopants. They found that the Fe dopants were inclined to be located at the interstitial site when the ZrO2 was in a cubic phase. However, the preparative methods used for synthesizing the cubic form of ZrO2 required high sintering temperature.19 Furthermore, due to the high sintering temperature, the dopants always precipitated from the ZrO2 structure. Thus, the high sintering temperature was the main barrier for synthesizing Fe doped cubic ZrO2 with a cubic phase. As well known, the nanomaterials have small size and high surface energy which can always reduce the reaction temperature significantly.20–22 Therefore, we used a new strategy to synthesize the Fe doped ZrO2 nanostructures to obtain the cubic form of Fe doped ZrO2 in low temperature. Our strategy for synthesizing Fe doped ZrO2 nanostructures was based on the calculation results above and our previous reports.21,22 The preparation detail information could be seen in the experimental information. ICP-AAS measurements (Table 1) revealed that the Fe concentrations of the ZrO2:Fe nanostructures gradually varied from 0 to 12.7%, just by tuning the ratios of the original Fe, Zr salts in the absorption solution. As the Zr4+ and Fe3+ were absorbed on the surface of the carbon spheres by the electrostatic force, the absorption ability of Zr4+ was stronger than that of Fe3+. This could explain why the ratio of Fe3+, Zr4+ is lower than that of the original solution. The SEM images of the pure ZrO2 and Fe doped ZrO2 (ZrO2:Fe 12.7%) nanostructures are shown in Fig. 4a and b. It identified that both the pure ZrO2 and ZrO2:Fe samples had a hollow spherical morphology and the size of the hollow spheres was in the range from 150 to 200 nm. The inset in Fig. 4b is the TEM image of Fe doped ZrO2 (ZrO2:Fe 12.7%). It could be seen that the shell of the hollow sphere is a single layer and the thickness of the shell is around 5 nm. The hollow spherical morphology with such a thin shell was beneficial for the photocatalysis in two aspects, which have been confirmed by our previous reports.20,21,23 First, the hollow sphere morphology had a high specific surface area, which meant that more areas could be illuminated.20,23 This could increase the interaction between the catalysts and solution (water + CH3OH) as well. Second, such a thin shell could reduce the transfer distance of the photo-induced carriers. Then, more photo-induced carriers could reach the surface and react with the solution rather than recombine inside the catalysts. Both of these do benefit the photo absorption, separation, transfer of photo-induced carriers, and surface activeness of the photocatalyst.22 The corresponding XRD patterns of the samples are shown in Fig. 4c. The significant broadening of all the diffraction peaks was due to the small size of the crystallites that made up the ZrO2:Fe hollow spheres. All diffraction peaks of the pure ZrO2 hollow spheres could be assigned to the monoclinic phase (space group: P21/c (14); monoclinic, a = 5.1461 Å b = 5.2118 Å and c = 5.313, 〈99.222〉; PDF#65-1024). The monoclinic ZrO2 phase was stable when there was only very small amount of dopants. Furthermore, the as-prepared ZrO2:Fe hollow spheres exhibited a phase conversion phenomenon when the doping content was increasing. The metastable fluorite structure of ZrO2:Fe hollow spheres (space group: Fmm (225); Cubic, a = 5.128 Å; PDF#49-1642) had been determined by XRD when the Fe content was higher than 5%. This was in good agreement with the previous reports about Fe-doped ZrO2.18 The stable crystalline form of ZrO2 at room temperature was the monoclinic one, and the reversible transformation to the cubic form was produced at 1900 °C.19 However, the monoclinic phase could transform to cubic form in such a low temperature as 400 °C, which has not been reported previously. According to the XRD results, the phase transformation was attributed to the nanoscale morphology and doping of iron ions. The cubic form of zirconia was well known as a metastable phase, which had excellent solvent properties for a fairly large variety of cations in different oxidation states.18 Thus, the doping contents could be dramatically increased when the cubic zirconia was formed.

In the doping system, the precipitation of the second phase could significantly affect its properties. Therefore, it was necessary to further verify the presentation of the second phase in the ZrO2:Fe nanostructures. By employing the KBr pellet technique, the Fourier transform infrared spectra (FTIR) of the prepared samples had been recorded in the 4000–340 cm−1 region. As a powerful spectroscopic tool, it could help us to verify the specific conditions of the doped materials (Fig. 5). A wide absorption band in the region of 3400–3430 cm−1 has been assigned to the stretching vibration mode of hydroxyl group (Fig. 5a).24 The band at 1630 cm−1, which appeared at wavelength just half of the 3400–3430 cm−1, has been assigned to the first overtone of the fundamental stretching mode of OH (Fig. 5b).19 These vibrations indicate the presence of bound H2O on the surface of the samples. A higher amount of surface hydroxyl groups on ZrO2:Fe may show the potential of the compound for the photocatalytic activity. The broad band at 506 cm−1 in the present case, was possibly assigned to the Zr–O vibration of ZrO2.24 As for the fluctuation at 586 cm−1 and 748 cm−1 for the ZrO2:Fe samples, where the Fe content was higher than 5%, it could be attributed to the presence of the Fe–O or Fe–Zr stretching vibrations in the ZrO2:Fe (Fig. 5c). However, these stretching vibrations were also different from the corresponding values of the pure iron oxides.25–27 Therefore, it illustrated that there was no second phase presented in the ZrO2:Fe system. Consequently, it verified that the doping metal elements were distributed in the ZrO2 host rather than precipitated as a second phase. Therefore, this synthetic scheme realized the introduction of metal dopants in the ZrO2 system.

The incorporation of Fe ions into the ZrO2 lattices could significantly modify the optoelectronic properties of the ZrO2:Fe nanostructures. Fig. 6 shows the room temperature optical absorption spectra of ZrO2 and several ZrO2:Fe nanostructures.

Obviously, the UV-vis absorption spectra of all ZrO2:Fe nanostructures displayed a red shift compared with pure ZrO2. The degree of red shift rose with the increasing Fe content. Besides, the band gap of the samples could be confirmed by the formula αhν = A(hν − Eg)1/2, where α, h, ν, A and Eg are the absorption coefficient, Planck constant, incident light frequency, a constant and band gap, respectively. By calculation, Fe doping shifted the absorption onset to the red side while Fe contents varied from 3.4% to 12.7%, representing a decrease in the band gap from 3.48 eV to 2.56 eV (Table 1). For the pure ZrO2, there was only an absorption tail in the UV spectra because the band offset of ZrO2 was beyond the measuring range of our experiments. Thus, we could not obtain the accurate band offset data of the pure ZrO2 nanostructures. However, it could still be seen that the band gap of the samples decreased gradually with the increase of Fe contents. According to the calculation results above, this resulted from the fact that the doping Fe ions had practically distributed in the ZrO2 host, which were either in interstitial position or substitutional position, and relevantly created either a new VBM or CBM to narrow the band gap of ZrO2.
To verify the band gap narrowing mechanism, we measured the density of states of the valence band in the ZrO2:Fe and pure cubic ZrO2 nanostructures by the valence band XPS (Fig. 7). The pure cubic ZrO2 nanostructures were obtained by sintering the samples at 1400 °C, and we assumed that its bandgap was 5.0 eV according to a previous report.5 The edge of the valence band of the pristine ZrO2 nanostructures was located at about 3.28 eV. Because the band gap of the pristine ZrO2 nanostructures was 5.0 eV, the conduction band minimum (CBM) would occur at about −1.72 eV. For the ZrO2:Fe, the VBM was located at approximately 1.21 eV. Combined with the results of the optical measurements (Fig. 6), the CBM of ZrO2:Fe should occur at about −1.35 eV. This suggested that the narrowing effect of the band gap was mainly due to the increase of VBM rather than the variation of CBM. Combined with the calculation results above, this was due to the fact that the interstitial Fe ions could create a new energy level above the original valence band of ZrO2 to narrow the ZrO2 band gap. Thus, these results demonstrated that the Fe ions were indeed in the interstitial position of the ZrO2 lattice.

In order to verify visible-light-driven water splitting performance of the ZrO2:Fe nanostructures, we have made the photocatalytic reactions over pure ZrO2, ZrO2:Fe (3.4%), ZrO2:Fe (7.3%) and ZrO2:Fe (12.7%). However, only the ZrO2:Fe (12.7%) showed obvious photocatalytic hydrogen production. In terms of bandgap Eg, it is 5.0 eV, 3.48 eV, 3.05 eV and 2.56 eV for pure ZrO2, ZrO2:Fe (3.4%), ZrO2:Fe (7.3%) and ZrO2:Fe (12.7%), respectively. According to the equation: λ = 1240/Eg (λ is the wavelength), the corresponding wavelength is 248 nm, 356 nm, 406 nm and 484 nm for pure ZrO2, ZrO2:Fe (3.4%), ZrO2:Fe (7.3%) and ZrO2:Fe (12.7%), respectively. Only the λ for ZrO2:Fe (12.7%) is larger than 420 nm, which was the cut-off filter used for the photocatalytic reactions. Thus, pure ZrO2 and the other two doped ZrO2 samples could not absorb the visible light and produced hydrogen under illumination larger than 420 nm. Fig. 8 shows the time course of the H2 evolution on ZrO2:Fe (12.7%) nanostructures in the presence of methanol as the sacrificial reagent. As shown in Fig. 8, the total evolution of hydrogen in 15 h was about 148 μmol under visible light irradiation (>420 nm). Additionally, the H2 evolution rate of the ZrO2:Fe nanostructures was 11.4 and 9.7 μmol h−1 in the first and last hour. Therefore, the Pt/ZrO2:Fe nanostructures exhibited a stable photocatalytic activity in three days. The quantum efficiency for H2 evolution in the 15 hours was estimated to be 0.17% under the wavelength of 440 nm. Thus, the ZrO2:Fe nanostructures provided a new high CBM photocatalyst for H2 evolution.

4. Conclusion
In conclusion, based on the first principle calculation, we found that the interstitial Fe atoms could not only decrease the bandgap of the ZrO2 but also maintain the high CBM energy level of the ZrO2. Using a template method, we have prepared the cubic form of Fe-doped ZrO2 nanostructures under low temperature, and the Fe contents in ZrO2 nanostructures could be precisely controlled. We found that the light absorption region could be broadened with the increase of the Fe doping content. Moreover, the Fe-doped ZrO2 nanostructures exhibited a high energy level of CBM and the visible-light driven H2 evolution activity. This research provides a new type of photocatalyst for H2 generation, which has a rare high energy level of CBM.
