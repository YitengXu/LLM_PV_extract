There is little doubt that energy obtained from fossil fuels is having a negative impact on the world climate. In order to reduce fossil fuel based CO2 emissions, alternative means of energy generation need to be urgently considered. Conventional photovoltaic devices (silicon-based solar cells) are an attractive and promising technology due to their high conversion efficiency.1 However the high cost of fabrication and toxicity of the chemicals used in the manufacturing of these devices limit their widespread applications. Dye sensitised solar cells (DSSCs) provide a potentially cheaper alternative to conventional silicon-based devices. The dye sensitiser in these devices has traditionally been a Ru based compound, but recently a number of non-metal alternatives have been successfully demonstrated, including families of porphyrin-based dyes. Energy conversion efficiencies as high as 11% have recently been achieved, with a donor–acceptor substituted porphyrin sensitiser and an organic solvent based electrolyte,2 thus making this family of dyes attractive for commercial application in DSSCs. The advantages of porphyrin sensitisers include reduced fabrication cost, a simple synthetic pathway and a larger molar extinction coefficient compared to ruthenium-based sensitisers. However, one of the main concerns with DSSC devices is the liquid electrolyte; problems with leakage or evaporation of the electrolyte have the potential to limit the device lifetime to an impractical degree. In order to overcome this problem, many attempts have been made to replace the liquid electrolyte with solid-state or quasi solid-state electrolytes such as p-type semiconductors,3 organic hole transport materials,4polymers or polymer-gel electrolytes.5
Another interesting class of solid state material for electrochemical devices are the plastic crystal electrolytes. Plastic crystal compounds are materials that exhibit long range order, but short-range rotational disorder.6 A typical feature of plastic crystals is the occurrence of a solid–solid phase transition below the melting point and waxiness or “plasticity” in the highest temperature solid phase.7 The plastic properties often derive from the fact that one or more species within the crystal lattice can undergo some kind of rotational motion. The existence of rotational motions in the crystalline phase, below the melting point, raises the entropy of the solid state closer to the liquid, thus producing a small entropy of fusion, ΔSf, compared to a fully ordered crystal. These materials often show significant conductivity, either in the neat form if they are ionic materials or on the addition of an ionic dopant. Plastic crystals have been investigated as potential electrolytes for Li-batteries8 and fuel cells.9Succinonitrile is a well known molecular plastic crystals that exhibits a solid–solid phase transition at −38 °C and melts at 58 °C, as shown in Fig. 1.

Succinonitrile as a solid state electrolyte was previously investigated in dye sensitised solar cells by Wang et al.,10 and a power conversion efficiency of ∼5% was achieved at full sun with a ruthenium-based sensitiser. Dai et al.11 have shown high mobility of the iodide-triiodide redox couple in this molecular plastic crystal, thus prompting our interest in studying this type of plastic crystal-based electrolyte with porphyrin dyes. Furthermore, the physical properties of these materials – molten at accessible temperatures and malleable in their solid state – mean that these electrolytes should be mechanically printable and therefore suitable for the large-scale assembly of DSSCs by reel-to-reel processing. Thus far the only solid state dye-sensitised solar cells with porphyrin sensitisers reported utilised the hole transport material spiro-OMeTAD, and the highest efficiency achieved was 3.7% at full sun intensity.12 In this paper we report efficiencies as high as 5.3% at moderate light intensity, through the use of succinonitrile as a solid state electrolyte in combination with a porphyrin-based-sensitiser, P159. The effect of the DSSC additives and an inorganic filler in the succinonitrile electrolyte is also discussed.
Three variations of the electrolytes were prepared. The pure succinonitrile based electrolyte (A1) was composed of 0.5 M N-methyl-N-butylpyrrolidinium iodide ([C4mpyr][I]) and 0.1 M Iodine in succinonitrile.10 Electrolyte A2 was made up of 0.4 M [C4mpyr][I], 0.1 M lithium iodide, 0.1 M iodine and 0.2 M N-methylbenzimidazole (NMB) in succinonitrile; NMB can produce a negative shift in the conduction band of the TiO2, thereby increasing the Voc.13 Electrolyte A3 had the same components as A2 but with the addition of 5 wt% of SiO2 nanoparticles (7 nm); such nanoparticle addition to electrolyte systems have been shown to produce enhanced transport properties.14,15 The electrolytes were mixed at 70 °C to ensure that all additives were completely dissolved in the succinonitrile. At room temperature, electrolytes A1, A2 and A3 were all waxy solids. Differential scanning calorimetry was used to investigate any change in the phase behaviour of succinonitrile in the presence of the other components. Fig. 1 shows a typical thermal trace of neat succinonitrile, the effect of doping with different amounts of silica nanoparticles, and the influence of the DSSC additives. Electrolyte A1 showed a decrease in the melting point of succinonitrile from 58 °C to 49 °C (peak), and there is a slight shift in the solid–solid phase behaviour. Similar effects were observed with electrolytes A2 and A3, but the melting point decreased to further, to 41 °C and 40 °C respectively (Table S1†). However, such thermal analysis does not reveal the detailed morphology of the electrolyte materials. One or more of the added components may exist predominantly at the grain boundaries, and as these regions are liable to be more highly defected than the bulk crystal this may facilitate mass transport. In extreme cases these grain boundary regions may represent a separate phase that exists within the bulk solid.
The onset temperatures of the transitions appear to be relatively unaffected by the addition of increasing amounts of silica, although the peaks are slightly broadened, possibly as a result of the thermal conductivity effect of the SiO2. The enthalpies of the phase transitions (Table S1†), calculated on a J g−1(succinonitrile) basis, decrease slightly with increasing silica content, suggesting a decrease in the crystallinity of the materials.

Fig. 2 shows the ionic conductivity of neat succinonitrile and electrolytes A1, A2 and A3 across a range of temperatures. An increase in conductivity is observed when the succinonitrile is doped with [C4mpyr][I] and iodine, and similar conductivity values are obtained in the presence of LiI and NMB. There is no significant difference in the ionic conductivities between electrolytes A1, A2 and A3. This is consistent with our previous observations on organic ionic plastic crystals, where we observe little increase in conductivity on addition of an inorganic filler to a material that already exhibits high conductivity in its pure state.16

In a dye sensitised solar cell the regeneration of the oxidised dye, after electron injection into the conduction band of TiO2, is mediated by the iodide/triiodide redox couple and the diffusivity of the triiodide is a key electrolyte property that can determine device performance. An electrochemical cell with a Pt working microelectrode (radius 5 μm), and Pt wire reference and counter electrodes, was used to determine the diffusion coefficients in the different electrolytes. As a comparison, the diffusivities in an ionic liquid electrolyte consisting of 0.5 M 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide and 0.1 M I2 in 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)amide was also measured; the steady state voltammograms are shown in Fig. S1.† Remarkably, the diffusion coefficients in the solid electrolytes (Table 1) are an order of magnitude higher than those of the ionic liquid based electrolyte. Every et al.17 have shown that mobility of ions can be much higher in the solid state than in the liquid state due to the presence of defects in the long range ordered crystalline lattice. Another possible contributor to the higher diffusivity of the redox species is the formation of polyiodides, which can facilitate diffusion of the iodidevia a Grotthus type mechanism.18 To confirm the presence of higher polyiodide species, electrolyte A1 was analysed by Raman spectroscopy. The Raman spectrum of the electrolyte with a nominal concentration of I2 of 0.1 M (Fig. S2†) showed the presence of both I3− and I5−.19 No significant change in the mobility of the redox species occurred on addition of lithium iodide and NMB (A2, Table 1) or upon addition of 5 wt% silica (A3, Table 1). Electrical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were performed to gain further insight into the influence of the electrolytes at the counter electrode. The charge transfer resistance at the Pt/electrolyte interface was measured using a symmetrical cell, and all three electrolytes showed similar charge transfer resistance (Fig. S3 and S4, Table S2).†

We have previously investigated the performance of a number of different porphyrin dyes with ionic liquids,20 and the best performing of these, the zinc porphyrin dye P159 (Fig. S5†) was chosen to assess the photovoltaic application of the succinonitrile-based electrolytes. Fig. 3 shows the IV characteristics of the DSSCs utilising the porphyrin dye with electrolytes A1, A2 and A3, at 100% sun intensity. The DSSC utilising the A3 electrolyte shows the best overall performance (Table 2). Electrolytes A2 and A3 produce an increase in current density compared to A1, most likely as a result of the presence of LiI. Unexpectedly, the addition of 5 wt% of SiO2 produces an increase of approximately 45 mV in Voc. One possible explanation for this is that the SiO2 is coordinating with any residual moisture present in the electrolyte, thus protecting the surface of the TiO2 from water, which can be detrimental to Voc.
 Fig. 3  IV characteristics of the DSSCs with the P159 porphyrin dye and solid state electrolytes A1, A2 and A3, dark current and at 100% sun intensity. 
The observed increase in Voc is consistent with the observations of Usui et al.21 and Katakabe et al.,15 who have reported the addition of TiO2 nanoparticles to IL-based DSSCs. However, the origin of this Voc increase is still not well understood.
Finally, we have studied the influence of sun intensity on photovoltaic performance (Figure S6, Table S3†). The best performance of 5.3% was achieved at 15% sun. At 100% sun intensity the energy conversion is 4.8%, which is remarkably similar to the 4.9% efficiency previously reported for DSSCs utilising an IL-based electrolyte with this porphyrin dye.20 The small drop in efficiency at 100% sun intensity may be due to mass transport limitations or inefficient charge screening of electron transport in the TiO2 film.11 Nevertheless, this is the first time such high efficiencies have been obtained in a porphyrin-sensitised solid state DSSC.
In summary, we have demonstrated that molecular plastic crystal-based solid state electrolytes can perform very well in DSSCs with a porphyrin sensitiser. Addition of nanoparticulate SiO2 to the electrolyte produced the highest device efficiency, reaching up to 5.3% at 15% sun.
