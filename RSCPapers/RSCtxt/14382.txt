The solvent treatment method can effectively create poly(ether sulfone) (PES) membranes with a well-controllable pore size and pore size distribution. An impressive vanadium flow battery (VFB) performance with a coulombic efficiency of over 99% and an energy efficiency of over 90% was obtained, which are the highest values ever reported for porous uncharged membranes. The concept provides an entirely novel, simple and cost-effective way to fabricate high-performance porous membranes for VFB applications.

Broader context
Vanadium flow batteries (VFBs) are well suited for large-scale energy storage and play a very important role in the wide application of renewable energies. However, their commercialization progress is hindered by the high cost and low selectivity of currently used perfluorinated ion exchange membranes. Porous membranes are regarded as one of the most promising candidates for VFBs due to their high stability, high selectivity and low cost. In this paper, a simple and effective solvent treatment method was developed to prepare porous membranes with a tunable morphology for VFB applications. The solvent treatment method can effectively create poly(ether sulfone) (PES) membranes with a well-controllable pore size and pore size distribution. A very impressive VFB performance was achieved for the treated uncharged PES membranes. This work provides an entirely novel, simple and cost-effective way to fabricate high-performance porous membranes for VFB applications and therefore will exert a high impact on the development of VFB technology, sustainable energy and the environment.

With increasing concerns over global environmental problems and resource exhaustion, it is more and more important to facilitate the utilization of renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power. Nevertheless, intermittence and instability are the main problems when using renewable energy sources to generate electricity.1,2 Over the past few years, increasing attention has been paid to electrochemical energy storage (EES), owing to its ability to smooth out the intermittence of renewable energy production, balance generation and demand, etc.1 Among the various kinds of EES technologies, vanadium flow batteries (VFBs) have received more and more attention due to their attractive characteristics of independently tunable power and capacity, long cycle life, high safety, high efficiency and environmental benignity.3–9
As a critical component of a VFB, the membrane plays the role of preventing cross-mixing of the positive and negative electrolytes, while still allowing for the transport of protons to complete the electrical circuit. An ideal membrane in a VFB should have features such as high proton conductivity, high ion selectivity, high chemical stability and low cost. However, the currently used commercial membranes, e.g. perfluorinated membranes (like DuPont Nafion) that are most commonly used in VFBs, have low ion selectivity and high cost, which restrict the further development of VFBs.10–12 As a result, developing high-performance membranes in order to accelerate the commercialization of VFBs is an urgent need. Recently, wide attention has been paid to non-perfluorinated membranes, such as sulfonated or quaternary ammoniated aromatic polymers, on account of their high thermal and mechanical stability, high ion selectivity and low cost. However, it is significantly hard for any of the current non-perfluorinated membranes to meet the required properties of VFBs with respect to chemical stability, which was proven to be caused by the intrinsic presence of ion exchange groups.13–17
In the last few years, our group has succeeded in introducing porous nanofiltration (NF) membranes into VFB applications,18 based on the idea of using pore size exclusion to realize the V/H selectivity. This new concept successfully overcomes the restriction caused by ion exchange groups from traditional ion exchange membranes. Due to this concept, different porous membranes based on polyacrylonitrile (PAN),18,19 poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF)20,21 and poly(ether sulfone) (PES)22,23 have been designed and fabricated via a phase inversion method.24 Based on those studies, some modification methods were further carried out to optimize membrane performance.
For instance, it is very hard for porous PVDF membranes to co-possess high proton conductivity and ion selectivity because of their strong hydrophobicity.20 Hence, the modification of porous membranes has attracted increasing interest.19–22,25–29 Actually, the porous membrane performance in VFBs could be adjusted by changing hydrophilicity, morphology,30etc.
Membrane morphology is another important factor in determining the final performance of VFBs. For this reason, most research on porous membranes in VFBs has been focused on the structure design to improve their performance, such as introducing additives into the casting solution, introducing an ultrathin ion-selective layer, changing the preparation parameters during the process of the phase inversion, etc.19–22,27,29,31–35 Our group has successfully designed a type of advanced charged membrane with a highly symmetric spongy structure for VFBs, introducing positively charged groups into poly(sulfone) (PSF) in order to combine the Donnan exclusion with pore size exclusion, finally obtaining a better balance between the ion selectivity and proton conductivity.31
As mentioned above, most modifications to the porous membranes aim to introduce charged groups on the pore walls,36–38 such as sulfonated or quaternary ammoniated groups, which will potentially affect their chemical stability. In addition, most modification methods are relatively complicated and expensive. Therefore, the fabrication of highly selective porous membranes without ion exchange groups is significantly important. Up to now, most pure polymer porous membranes (without any modification), e.g. PSF,31 PVDF,20 PAN,18 showed a relatively poor performance due to the conflict between ion selectivity and proton conductivity, which is mainly affected by the pore morphology. Pores of small size and with a high interconnectivity are highly preferred to ensure high ion selectivity and proton conductivity. In the phase inversion method,20,21,27 it is common that when the pore size decreases or the membrane selectivity increases, the interconnectivity of the pores will decrease, leading to a low proton conductivity. The performance of the porous membranes based on pristine polymers, such as PES, PVDF and PAN, is relatively poor (the energy efficiency is normally less than 80% at 80 mA cm−2).19–21,27 Therefore, to fabricate porous membranes with small pores but a high interconnectivity is highly significant in order to achieve a cost-effective energy storage system. Recently, it was reported that solvent treatment could induce reorganization of the membrane structure and further tune the membrane morphology.39,40
Herein we demonstrate a simple and versatile way to tune the morphology of the porous membranes. Membranes with relatively large but well-interconnected pores were selected as the starting materials. A solvent treatment method was then applied to effectively decrease the pore size to create vanadium-ion rejection, while still keeping the high interconnectivity. Hence, the membranes can co-possess high proton conductivity and ion selectivity.
To prove this concept, PES polymers were selected as the matrix because of their excellent chemical and mechanical stability. The morphology of the porous PES membranes, which were obtained by the phase inversion method, was adjusted via introducing poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP) into the casting solution.27,41 The porous PES membranes were treated with isopropanol (IPA), followed by controlling the solvent evaporation to tune the morphology of the porous PES membranes. The relationship between solvent treatment and morphology, as well as the performance of the treated porous PES membranes in VFBs, was established (Scheme 1).

Results and discussion
The porous PES membranes with different morphologies were prepared via the phase inversion method and subsequently immersed in IPA, after which IPA was evaporated from the membranes for different time periods to shrink the pores. The resulting membranes are referred to as MX-t, where X is the PVP/(PES + PVP) mass ratio in the casting solution and t is the solvent evaporation time, respectively. In the cross-section (Fig. 1b and Fig. S1, ESI†), all of the membranes showed a typical asymmetric structure, composed of a thin skin-layer and a sublayer with finger-like macrovoids.18 With an increasing PVP content, the skin-layer of the porous PES membranes changed from a relatively dense sponge-like structure to a more open structure with larger pores (Fig. S2, ESI†).
 Fig. 1  The cross-section morphology of the PES membranes (b and e) and the corresponding magnified morphology of the pore wall of the macrovoid (a and d) as well as of the skin-layer (c and f). 
The cross-section morphology of the membranes before and after solvent treatment is shown in Fig. 1. After a 24 hour evaporation time, the solvent was removed completely from the membranes, as confirmed by TGA (Fig S3, ESI†). MX and MX-24 were thus compared to investigate the overall change of the membrane structure caused by such a solvent immersion–evaporation process. The cross-section morphology of the porous PES membranes was clearly changed after the treatment, especially in the skin-layer, which is the layer that determines the selectivity of the membranes. A less pronounced change took place on the pore walls of the macrovoids. It was clear that there was a distinct decrease in the pore size after solvent treatment (Fig. 1c vs. f).
The increase in the evaporation time resulted in a gradual decrease in pore size (Fig. 2). The morphology of M20-0 was similar to that of M20, indicating that only the IPA immersion without evaporation did not influence the membrane morphology. Considering the highly interconnected structure of the starting membranes,27,30 the interconnectivity of the membranes after solvent treatment is expected to be high as well, while the denser structure with smaller pores in the skin-layer can effectively prevent the transport of vanadium ions, ensuring a high ion selectivity.
 Fig. 2  The cross-section morphology of M20 before and after evaporating the solvent at different times (a) M20, (b) M20-0, (c) M20-0.5, and (d) M20-24. 
The SEM images clearly indicated that controlling the solvent evaporation time could tune the pore size of the membranes. To quantify this change in pore size, the average pore size was calculated from the Poiseuille equation via pure water fluxes (Fig. S4, ESI†). The average pore sizes of all treated PES membranes were about one order of magnitude smaller than those of the corresponding untreated membranes (Table S1, ESI†).
For the untreated PES membranes, the average pore size also increased with increasing PVP content in the casting solution. While there was no large difference in the average pore sizes of M20-24, M25-24 and M30-24, the pores in M35-24 were larger (Table S1, ESI†). Also for this PVP-containing series, the porosities of the treated PES membranes were lower than those of the corresponding untreated membranes. It is worth noting that as the PVP content increases, the change in average pore size and porosity upon solvent treatment becomes more significant. When the PVP/(PES + PVP) mass ratio was 35% for instance, the average pore size decreased from 22.79 nm to 3.99 nm and the porosity decreased from 95.77% to 76.20% (Table S1, ESI†). These results can be explained by the fact that with an increasing PVP content, the structure of the untreated PES membranes is more open (Fig. S1 and S2, ESI†), resulting in a reduced resistance to shrinkage. These results of both the average pore size and porosity prove that shrinkage did happen during solvent evaporation.
As is shown in Fig. 3, all of the treated PES membranes (MX-24) exhibited a much lower vanadium ion permeation rate, which could represent the ion selectivity of the membranes, than the untreated ones. The permeability follows the same trend as the pore size and porosity (Fig. S5 and Table S1, ESI†). In general, vanadium ion transport can be more effectively hindered via reducing the pore size, thus causing a higher rejection for the vanadium ions as compared to the much smaller protons. Except for M35-24 which has a structure that is clearly far too open, all of the treated PES membranes showed a much lower vanadium ion permeation rate than Nafion 115, indicating the excellent ion selectivity of the treated PES membranes. Furthermore, the permeability of the vanadium ions with different valence states (V2+/VO2+/V3+) through the membranes of M20 and M20-24 was detected and is shown in Fig. S6, ESI†. Regardless of the valence states of the vanadium ions, the vanadium ion permeation rates of M20-24 were all much lower than those of M20, further confirming the high selectivity of the solvent treated PES membranes. The sequence of the permeation ratios of vanadium ions with different valence states through all of the membranes is V2+ > VO2+ > V3+, which agrees well with the literature.42

In most cases, a higher ion selectivity can result in a lower proton conductivity as the pores would start to lose interconnectivity as they get narrower. In the present design, pore shrinkage is induced on the very open membranes with highly interconnected pores. Therefore, the interconnectivity can be kept and a high proton conductivity can be expected. There was only an extremely slight difference in the area resistance of all of the treated PES membranes, which was also much lower than that of Nafion 115 (Table S1, ESI†). Moreover, the area resistances for the untreated and treated PES membranes were hardly different, proving that the decreased pore size did not impose extra obstructions for the transport of protons. Even the smallest pores of the treated PES membranes can still allow the free and rapid transport of protons, which contributes to the high proton conductivity in VFBs (Fig. 4).

The treated PES membranes thus presented a high ion selectivity and excellent proton conductivity, which were expected to result in an impressive performance for VFB applications. As is illustrated in Fig. 5, much higher coulombic efficiency (CE) and energy efficiency (EE) were achieved for a VFB single cell assembled with the treated PES membranes than those of the corresponding reference membranes at a current density of 80 mA cm−2. After being solvent treated, the CE, determined by the ratio of a battery's discharge capacity to its charge capacity, increased dramatically from 54.71% (M30) to 98.95% (M30-24). The higher CE, indicating a lower capacity loss, was largely caused by more barriers for the passage of vanadium ions. Besides, the capacity loss also decreased. This phenomenon was in accordance with the results of pore size, porosity and vanadium permeability of the membranes. In the mean time, the EE, the product of voltage efficiency (VE) and CE, serves as an indicator of the energy conversion ratio in a charge–discharge process, improving from 49.89% (M30) to 89.69% (M30-24) after solvent treatment. Furthermore, a VFB assembled with M20-24 showed a CE of 99.34% and an EE of 90.19%, which were much higher than when using Nafion 115 (93.38% and 82.45%). Such impressive results were mainly derived from the change in the membrane morphology caused by the solvent treatment.
 Fig. 5  VFB performance of the untreated and treated PES membranes with different PVP/(PES + PVP) mass ratios at 80 mA cm−2 (a) 20%, (b) 25%, (c) 30%, and (d) 35%. 
However, the VE, defined as the ratio of a battery's discharge voltage to its charge voltage, of the VFB single cell assembled with the treated PES membranes hardly changed compared with that of the corresponding untreated membranes, while there was a significant improvement in CE and EE (Fig. 5). The largest change in VE was only a decrease from 91.96% (M20) to 90.79% (M20-24). In addition, the smallest VE (M30: 90.65%) of all of the treated PES membranes was still higher than that of Nafion 115 (88.30%) at a current density of 80 mA cm−2. The higher VE is mainly due to the free and unobstructed transport of the protons across the membranes. That result is in agreement with the area resistance of the membranes. Such a negligible decrease in VE can be attributed to the higher proton conductivity due to the well-interconnected nature of the smaller pores.
It is quite notable that the CE, EE and VE of the VFBs assembled with M20-2/12/24, M25-12/24 and M30-12/24 are all much higher than those of Nafion 115. In addition, the VFBs assembled with M20-24, M25-24 and M30-24 achieved a CE of over 98%, a VE of over 90% and an EE of over 89% (Fig. S7d, ESI†). Complete solvent evaporation thus produces the best performing membranes for VFBs. A very impressive VFB performance with a CE of over 99%, and an EE of over 90% (M20-24) was obtained, which are the highest values ever reported for porous membranes without charged groups.

Fig. 5 separates the role of solvent immersion and solvent evaporation for the M20 and M30 membranes in improving battery performance. With only solvent immersion (t = 0 h), there was almost no change in the efficiencies, while CE and EE improved dramatically when increasing the solvent evaporation time to 0.5 h (Fig. 5a and c). The results indicate that solvent evaporation plays the most important role in adjusting the morphology of the porous PES membranes, which is consistent with the SEM results. When t was kept at 2 h, the higher PVP content led to a larger variation in CE and EE, while there was still no obvious change in VE (Fig. S7b, ESI†). The morphology of the untreated PES membranes was more open (bigger pore size and higher porosity), and their amplitude of variation in morphology was larger, hence causing a more distinct change in the properties. Nonetheless, because the structure of M35 was too open, the shrinkage of the structure couldn’t make the pores small enough, leading to a smaller change in efficiencies when t was short (0.5 h) (Fig. S7a, ESI†). Nevertheless, although pore size was relatively large and the porosity was comparably high (Table S1, ESI†), the VFB single cell assembled with M35-24 also obtained a higher VE (92.71%) and EE (87.85%) than that with Nafion 115. All of these results show that the entire solvent evaporation results in the excellent performance of the porous PES membranes in VFBs, regardless of the PVP content (Fig. 5 and Fig. S7d, ESI†). In addition, a multicycle IPA treatment on the PES membranes showed that the solvent treatment method has a very high reversibility. There are almost no changes in the efficiencies of M20-24 after multiple cycles of the solvent treatment (Fig. S8, ESI†).
The performance of the VFB single cell, assembled with M20-24 under different current densities, is illustrated in Fig. 6. The CE increases from 95.56% to 98.98%, while the VE decreases from 94.99% to 79.31% as the current density varies from 40 mA cm−2 to 200 mA cm−2. The CE remained above 98% at current densities ranging from 60 mA cm−2 to 200 mA cm−2, indicating the prominent ion selectivity of the membranes under various current densities. The lower CE at 40 mA cm−2 might be caused by the longer charge–discharge time. Thus, the total amount of cross-mixed vanadium ions increased, leading to a higher capacity loss and lower CE. The decreased VE could be attributed to the higher ohmic polarization and overpotential at a higher current density. As a result, this membrane demonstrated a CE of 99.01% and an EE of 81.86% at a current density of 160 mA cm−2.

To investigate the chemical stability of the treated PES membranes under strong acidic and oxidizing conditions, the VFB single cell assembled with M20-24 was cycled at a current density of 80 mA cm−2 (Fig. 7). The battery was able to continuously run for more than 100 cycles, without efficiency decay, showing a good chemical stability in the VFB operating environment. As is shown in Fig. S9, ESI†, the concentration of VO2+ reduced from VO2+ changed rarely as the testing time increased. Moreover, the increase in the VO2+ concentration containing M20-24 is less than that containing Nafion 115, illustrating that the chemical stability of M20-24 could even outperform that of commercial Nafion 115. In addition, the material cost of the porous PES membranes is around $10 m−2, which is much lower than that of commercial Nafion 115 ($600–800 m−2). These results indicate that the utilization of the treated PES membranes in VFBs will promote the further commercial application of VFBs.

A first attempt to explain the mechanism behind the solvent treatment effect on the membrane morphology is given below. When a porous PES membrane is immersed in a good solvent, swelling of the membrane will occur (Tables S1 and S2, ESI†). With IPA as the solvent, the swelling was larger when more PVP was added (Table S1, ESI†), due to the more open morphology. Swelling renders the polymer chains more mobile and allows them to reorganize. The polymer chains expand under the action of this swelling force, thus causing the expansion of the membranes. At equilibrium, the swelling force is equal to the cohesive force. The cohesive force43 is a kind of inherent property of the polymers which can shrink the polymer network i.e. shrink the membranes. When the solvent starts to evaporate from the membranes, this balance between the swelling force and the cohesive force is broken up and the swelling force decreases gradually as less solvent remains. Thus, the membrane begins to shrink under the overall force (i.e. the difference between the cohesive force and the swelling force) (Scheme 2). This shrinkage can go beyond the starting state of the porous structure as the PES chains have had the opportunity to rearrange during the swollen state. Indeed, it is known that phase inversion is a very fast process, solidifying the polymers in a subsecond time scale and not leaving them any time to rearrange into more favorable energy states. This is exactly the opportunity which is offered during the swelling/evaporation process. When no solvent evaporates from the membrane, these two forces remain balanced, resulting in no shrinkage of the membrane (Fig. 2b). Therefore, there is almost no change in the battery performance between MX-0 and MX (X = 20 or 30) (Fig. 5a and c). This result also proves that the expansion of the membranes during solvent immersion as such does not influence the porous structure much. On the contrary, when t was 0.5 h, there was a significant improvement in the battery performance of the membranes compared with 0 h (Fig. 5a and c). Indeed, as the solvent evaporates, the swelling force decreases gradually, leading to an increasing acting force for shrinkage. Consequently, the battery performance of the porous PES membranes improved with increasing evaporation times (Fig. 5).
 Scheme 2  The evolution of the pore during solvent treatment. 
The role that the swelling behavior plays in changing the porous membrane structure can be well illustrated through the comparison of the battery performance of the M20 and M30 series (Fig. 5a and c). As the PVP content increased, the pore structure was more open and the porous membranes were less resistant to swelling. Consequently, the swelling ratio of M30 was larger than that of M20 (Table S1, ESI†). The degree of variation in the battery performance of M30-0.5 was thus larger than that of M20-0.5, owing to a stronger swelling force (Fig. S7a, ESI†). The battery performance of the VFBs assembled with M20-t systematically realized the best performance (Fig. S7, ESI†). This results from the intrinsically denser structure of M20, becoming the most compact after solvent evaporation.
The role that solvent volatility plays during solvent treatment in changing the membrane structure can be understood by treating the membranes with different solvents (n-hexane, ethanol, IPA and water). The volatizing order is n-hexane > ethanol > IPA > water (Table S2, ESI†). In theory, the more volatile the solvent, the more solvent would evaporate from the membranes in a given period of time, i.e. resulting in an increased acting force to shrink. It is clear that water is the least interesting solvent to apply the solvent treatment with. Probably, it is not sufficiently volatile to lead to significant changes at the shorter time scales.
When t was 24 h, the increase in the battery performance of the membranes was the most significant independent of the solvent type (Fig. S10c, ESI†). Solvent independence upon complete evaporation can be ascribed to the fact that the cohesive force is an inherent property of the material. When all solvent has been removed, this cohesive force is indeed the only force remaining. Although during solvent immersion, swelling can affect the value of the cohesive force, the variation range of it won’t be high.43 Therefore, the extent of membrane shrinking is actually similar, finally leading to analogical deformation of the porous membranes structure.
Even though the IPA treatment seems to have the best impact on the membrane structure, the battery performance of the membranes treated in ethanol or hexane was not that different. A combination of factors might play a role here, such as the surface tension and polarity of the solvents or specific interactions with the polymer. During solvent evaporation, the favorable molecular interaction between the solvent and the membrane would prevent the solvent in the membranes from leaving.
When treating porous PVDF membranes with IPA, the battery performance of the VFBs assembled with solvent treated PVDF membranes also showed an increased CE, but a declined VE (Table S3, ESI†). When t was 2 h, the drastic shrinkage of the PVDF membranes led to an extremely compact morphology. As a result, the membranes couldn’t properly conduct protons any more to complete the charge–discharge cycle. These results were different from those of the IPA treated porous PES membranes. So, even though the pore structure of the PVDF membranes also shrank during solvent treatment, the strong hydrophobicity of PVDF and its smaller pore size led to a blocked passage for the protons. On the one hand, these results demonstrate the universality of the solvent treatment method. On the other hand, they show that specific polymer/solvent interactions are significant.
Conclusions
A simple, facile and cost-effective solvent treatment method was proposed to prepare high-performance porous PES membranes with a tunable morphology for VFB applications. High ion selectivity together with excellent proton conductivity was obtained, thanks to the solvent induced shrinkage of the pores. At a current density of 80 mA cm−2, a very significant increase of CE from 54.71% to 98.95% and EE from 49.89% to 89.69% was realized, with only a slight decrease in VE from 91.19% to 90.65% (M30 to M30-24), all much higher than those of Nafion 115. It is worth noting that unlike most modification methods reported previously, no charged groups have been introduced. In addition, the VFB single cell assembled with M20-24 achieved an impressive VFB performance with a CE of 99.34% and an EE of 90.19% after optimization, which are the highest values ever reported for porous uncharged membranes.

Broader context
Vanadium flow batteries (VFBs) are well suited for large-scale energy storage and play a very important role in the wide application of renewable energies. However, their commercialization progress is hindered by the high cost and low selectivity of currently used perfluorinated ion exchange membranes. Porous membranes are regarded as one of the most promising candidates for VFBs due to their high stability, high selectivity and low cost. In this paper, a simple and effective solvent treatment method was developed to prepare porous membranes with a tunable morphology for VFB applications. The solvent treatment method can effectively create poly(ether sulfone) (PES) membranes with a well-controllable pore size and pore size distribution. A very impressive VFB performance was achieved for the treated uncharged PES membranes. This work provides an entirely novel, simple and cost-effective way to fabricate high-performance porous membranes for VFB applications and therefore will exert a high impact on the development of VFB technology, sustainable energy and the environment.
