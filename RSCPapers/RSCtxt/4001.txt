    , Accepted 10th July 2017First published on 11th July 2017AbstractFluorine-substituted benzothiadiazole (BT) was introduced as a core structure to construct new hole transport materials. Planar perovskite solar cells with conventional materials (CH3NH3PbI3−xClx) were fabricated. The perovskite solar cells using monofluorinated BT exhibit a leading efficiency of 18.54% with a FF as high as 81%.
The rapid development of organic–inorganic halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has become highly important since the pioneering work by Miyasaka et al. in 2009.1–3 Perovskites have valuable merits, such as broad light harvesting ranges with high extinction coefficients, direct band gaps and long charge diffusion lengths.4,5 The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells reached 22.1% in 2016, making PSCs an excellent game changer in the field of photovoltaic cells.6–9 In a typical perovskite solar cell device, the hole transport material (HTM) is indispensable, which plays a key role in extracting and transmitting holes from the perovskite materials to the counter electrode (usually Ag or Au).2
Spiro-OMeTAD (2,2-7,7-tetrakis(N,N′-di-paramethoxy-phenylamine 9,9′-spirobifluorene)) is one of the most effective state-of-the-art HTM materials reported to date, and its record efficiency has surpassed 20%.10,11 However, the tedious synthetic procedures and purification processes of the Spiro-type structure make it cost ineffective and thus limit its application and commercialization.12 In order to simplify the synthetic process, much attention has been focused on non-Spiro-type small organic molecules, and a variety of HTMs have been devised and synthesized in recent years. For instance, phenothiazine, acridine, star-shaped benzotrithiophene (BTT), truxene, azulene, biphenyl-based HTMs, tetraphenylethylene, and so on, have been developed as core structures for HTMs, and high efficiencies approaching 19% have been achieved.13–23
Fluorine-substituted benzothiadiazole (FBT) has shown great promise for enhancing the efficiency of polymer/small molecule-based bulk heterojunction solar cells (BHJ), and the incorporation of fluorine has demonstrated a noticeable improvement in the short-circuit current (Jsc) and/or fill factor (FF) compared to those of non-fluorinated polymer/small molecule-based devices.24,25 As far as we know, to date, fluorine-substituted BT (FBT) has rarely been used in HTMs with highly twisted structures. Only in some cases of D–A conjugated polymer/small molecule HTMs has FBT been used to tune the energy levels and also to increase charge mobility.26,27 According to the literature reports, electron-donating moieties are more preferable as a core structure to construct amorphous HTMs.28 Quite recently, our group devised a new HTM JY5 on the basis of a previously reported biphenyl-centred X51.29 By incorporating an electron-withdrawing benzothiadiazole unit (BT) as the core structure, the PCE of JY5-based PSCs was enhanced by 30% versus X51-based PSCs under the same test conditions.30 To further understand the relationship between the molecular structure of the HTMs and the performance of the corresponding PSCs, and also to evaluate the increased electron-withdrawing ability of the central structure, in this work, FBT was introduced as the core structure, and JY6 and JY7 were specially designed using monofluorinated BT and difluorinated BT as core structures and investigated in a comparative manner (Scheme 1). Monofluorinated BT in JY6 increases its hole mobility, hole extraction and hole transportation abilities, and thus significantly enhances the photovoltaic performance. JY7, with two F atoms, instead shows low hole mobility due to its poor film quality, and results in an inefficient solar cell performance. It turned out that JY6 exhibited the best efficiency among the HTMs studied, and a high power conversion efficiency of 18.54% was achieved, with Voc = 1066 mV, Jsc = 21.39 mA cm−2 and a remarkable FF of 81%. JY7, with difluorinated BT, shows a relatively lower efficiency of 15.71%, mainly due to its poor film quality. The results demonstrate that the suitable modification of fluorine on a BT unit can increase the thermal stability and hole transportation properties and ultimately enhance the PSC performance.
 Scheme 1  Chemical structures of JY5, JY6 and JY7. 
The detailed synthetic procedures for JY6 and JY7 are shown in the ESI.† 4,7-Dibromo-5-fluorobenzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole and 4,7-dibromo-5,6-difluorobenzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole are commercially available. The intermediate compound, 4,4′-dimethoxydiphenylamine-substituted carbazole, was synthesized according to our previously reported methods.22 It then underwent an Ullmann reaction with 4-bromonium iodobenzene and reacted with bis(pinacolato)diboron to give the intermediate compound, 1. JY6 and JY7 were synthesized through a Suzuki cross-coupling reaction between compound 1 and the fluorinated benzothiadiazole. The structures of JY6 and JY7 were fully characterized by 1H NMR, 13C NMR and HRMS measurements.
The UV-vis absorption spectra of JY6 and JY7 in solution are shown in Fig. 1a, together with the absorption spectrum of JY5. The absorption spectra of the three BT-based HTMs are quite similar, as observed in Fig. 1a. The main absorption bands for these compounds are located at about 285 and 300 nm, with quite weak shoulder bands at longer wavelengths (400–500 nm). Although the electron-withdrawing ability of the core structure increases from JY5 to JY7, their maximum absorption bands have little distinction. This indicates poor conjugation in this series of molecules. The energy levels of the new HTMs were estimated from cyclic voltammetry measurements (CV) (Fig. S7, ESI†). The first oxidation potential determines the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level on the basis of the HOMO of the reference compound, Spiro-OMeTAD (−5.22 eV).31 The HOMO levels of the new HTMs were determined to be −5.21 eV for JY6 and −5.23 eV for JY7, which are close to that of JY5 (−5.21 eV). The HOMO levels of these HTMs are in good accordance with the results from DFT calculations. Although FBT is more electron-deficient compared to BT, the HOMO levels of the three compounds are still quite close. The results suggest that the conjugation of the central BT unit with the peripheral carbazole derivatives is poor. The photophysical and electronic parameters are summarized in Table S1 (ESI†). The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level was calculated based on the HOMO level and the energy band gap, which was obtained from the onset of the absorption spectra. As described in Fig. 1b, the LUMO levels of the new HTMs are much higher than the conducting band of the perovskite (−3.93 eV). In particular, the LUMO of JY6 (−2.87 eV) is slightly higher than those of the other two molecules, suggesting that the undesired electron back transfer from perovskite to the counter electrode could be more efficiently prohibited in JY6. The hole mobility was measured using the SCLC method as shown in Fig. S9 (ESI†), and the HTMs were all doped before measurement.32 It turned out that JY6 exhibits the highest hole mobility among the HTMs studied, while JY7 shows a similar hole mobility to that of JY5 (Table S1, ESI†).
 Fig. 1  (a) UV-vis absorption spectra of JY5, JY6 and JY7 in solution; (b) energy levels of the new HTMs, JY5, JY6 and JY7, with respect to the perovskite materials and the electrodes. 
The frontier molecular orbitals of the HTMs were calculated using density functional theory (DFT) at the B3LYP/6-31+G(d)* level (Scheme S2, ESI†).33 The HOMOs are mainly distributed on the peripheral carbazole derivatives. For JY5, the HOMO is evenly distributed on the carbazole derivatives on both sides, whereas for JY6 and JY7, the HOMOs are mainly located on one of the carbazole moieties. The LUMOs for the three HTMs are distributed exclusively on the central BT or FBT moiety. The dihedral angles between carbazole and the central benzene are about 130°, and those between benzene and BT or FBT are about 140° for the three compounds, according to the optimized structure configuration. This indicates that the central planarity in the three molecules is quite similar.
The thermal properties of JY6 and JY7 were determined by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) techniques, and the results are shown in Fig. S8 (ESI†). The thermal decomposition temperatures (Td) were deduced from 5% weight loss of the compounds. Td of JY6 and JY7 is about 481 °C and 484 °C, respectively. It is noteworthy that compared to that of JY5 without F atoms (Td for JY5 is 448 °C), the Td values of JY6 and JY7 are significantly increased, which should be ascribed to the introduction of fluorine atoms which enhances the thermal stability. The glass transition temperatures (Tg) for JY6 and JY7 are 154 °C and 134 °C, respectively. The results indicate that the new compounds, JY6 and JY7, have excellent thermal stabilities and are capable of application in perovskite solar cells.
Steady-state and time-resolved PL decay curves were recorded to investigate the hole extraction and hole transportation properties of the new HTMs (Fig. S11, ESI†). When different HTMs were deposited on top of the perovskite, its emission peak (ca. 780 nm) was significantly quenched. Obviously, JY6 shows the highest quenching efficiency, suggesting that JY6 could more effectively extract holes from the perovskite. In addition, the PL decay was accelerated in the device containing JY6, compared to that using JY5 or JY7. The results further demonstrate that by incorporating the mono-fluorine-substituted BT unit as the core structure, the hole extraction and hole transportation abilities are greatly improved.
To test the ability of JY6 and JY7 as HTMs, normal planar device architectures of FTO/compact TiO2/perovskite/HTM/Ag were prepared. Cross-section scanning electron microscopy images of the perovskite solar cells with different HTMs were studied, as shown in Fig. S10 (ESI†). For each HTM, a perovskite layer is sandwiched between the TiO2 compact layer and the HTM layer, with a clear interface boundary. Meanwhile, large crystallites of the perovskite maintaining a high coverage on the substrate were also observed. Unexpectedly, the JY7 film was of quite poor quality, and rough particles dozens of nanometres in size were detected. To further investigate the film quality of these HTMs, the top view of the JY5, JY6 and JY7 films on top of the perovskite layer was measured by FE-SEM imaging (Fig. 2). It was observed that the JY5 and JY6 films exhibit a relatively smooth morphology. In sharp contrast, the JY7 film is quite rough with lots of small holes, which will definitely affect the charge mobility as well as the charge transfer ability of the JY7-based device, and therefore will deteriorate the PCE of the corresponding solar cells.

The photovoltaic properties of perovskite solar cells using JY6 and JY7 as HTMs were systematically investigated, and the PSC of JY5 was studied for comparison. Planar configurations of the perovskite solar cell devices were adopted, based on the conventional perovskite material (CH3NH3PbI3−xClx). The performances were measured under AM 1.5 G 100 mW cm−2 simulated light illumination. The current–voltage (J–V) curves are collected in Fig. 3a, and the detailed photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1. Excitingly, the device prepared using JY6 as the HTM exhibits the highest power conversion efficiency of 18.54% among the HTMs investigated, with Jsc = 21.39 mA cm−2, Voc = 1066 mV and a high FF of 81%. JY7, under the same conditions, shows a much lower efficiency of 15.71%, with Jsc = 20.58 mA cm−2, Voc = 1047 mV and a FF of 73%. The performance of the JY7-based solar cell is even a little lower than that of the JY5-based device (16.87%). It is noteworthy that so far, there are only a few cases in which FF values have been reported to surpass 80%, and the high FF value achieved in the JY6-based device is among the highest FF values in current perovskite solar cells.34–37 The incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of the perovskite solar cells with different HTMs are shown in Fig. 3b. The three HTM-based devices all exhibit a broad conversion range from 400–750 nm, and the intensity of the JY6-based solar cell is higher than that of the other two HTMs, which is also consistent with their J–V curves. The reference HTM, Spiro-OMeTAD, was also investigated under the same conditions. We are glad to see that the PSCs using JY6 are even slightly superior to those using Spiro-OMeTAD as the HTM (16.24%). Therefore, the introduction of fluorine atoms to the BT unit in this molecular system was successful. Using a monofluorinated BT unit as the core structure could increase the hole extraction and hole transportation abilities, improve the film quality and ultimately enhance the solar cell performance. However, using difluorinated BT severely affects the film quality and thus results in a prominently decreased PCE.

The hysteresis behaviours of PSCs using JY6 and JY7 as HTMs were investigated by scanning the J–V curves from positive to negative voltage and vice versa, as well as by scanning at different delay times (0, 100, 200 and 500 ms). The J–V curves recorded under different conditions are presented in Fig. S12 (ESI†), and the detailed parameters are summarized in Tables S1 and S2 (ESI†). It was observed that for JY6, forward scanning generates a PCE of 18.54%, while the reverse scan results in a slightly lower PCE of 16.47%. For JY7, forward and reverse scanning results in PCEs of 15.71% and 14.95%, respectively. Similar trends were observed from scanning at different delay times. The results suggest that there is little hysteresis in the PSCs fabricated using the new HTMs.
The stability of the PSCs using different HTMs was measured in a N2 filled glove box, with the devices unencapsulated. Initially, we tried to test the device stability under ambient conditions. However, the additives (LiTFSI and tBP) are indispensable for the HTMs to achieve high hole mobility, but the additives are quite hygroscopic, which will cause decomposition of the perovskite materials and deteriorate the device performance quickly. We were therefore only able to conduct the stability tests in a glovebox under an inert atmosphere. The current–voltage curves were measured at regular time intervals and the results are shown in Fig. S14, ESI.† The stability of the JY5-based device is shown for comparison. The JY6-based device exhibits a 16.1% decrease, and the JY7-based device shows a 24.2% decrease after 500 h. As a result, the new HTM, JY6, results in a more stable PSC compared to its analogues, JY5 and JY7.
In summary, we introduced a fluorinated BT unit as the core structure to develop new amorphous HTMs, namely JY6 and JY7. Such an electron-deficient moiety is rarely applied in HTMs with highly twisted structures. JY6, containing monofluorinated BT, exhibits suitable energy levels, excellent thermal stability and good hole extraction and hole transportation abilities. In addition, the surface morphology of the JY6-based film is smooth. As a result, a high PCE of 18.54% was achieved in the JY6-based device, with a remarkable FF value of 81%. However, JY7, containing difluorinated BT, exhibits an inferior performance, mainly due to its poor film-forming properties. The results of this work suggest that fluorinated BT is a competitive material for constructing HTMs with highly twisted structures, and this might provide new insight into designing efficient HTMs in the future.
