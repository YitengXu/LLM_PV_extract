, Accepted 2nd August 2016First published on 3rd August 2016AbstractBlack titania (H-TiO2) as a photoanode material has attracted huge attention due to its extremely high optical absorption in the visible region. Herein, black TiO2 doped with HfO2 shows ∼45.7% higher photo-conversion efficiency than H-TiO2 under identically similar conditions. The incorporation of HfO2 nanodots increased the optical scattering in H-TiO2 only when it underwent hydrogenation along with TiO2. Hafnia-doped TiO2 (HfO2/TiO2) is synthesized by a combination of simple sol–gel and hydrothermal method followed by thermal annealing under controlled hydrogen atmosphere. The hydrogenated H-(TiO2/HfO2) exhibited very high optical absorption but slightly lower than H-TiO2 due to light scattering by HfO2 nanodots. We observed a sharp decrease in optical band gap of TiO2/HfO2 from 3.2 to 2.4 eV up on hydrogen annealing, which is important in solar applications as demonstrated by the fabrication of high efficiency dye sensitized solar cells (DSSC).
1. Introduction
Energy harvesting via the Sun is a global challenge that require efficient and robust solar active materials. Solar applications involving photoactive material, such as photocatalytic studies,1 solar cells2 and hydrogen production,3 have attracted significant attention due to increasing energy demand and depleting non-renewable resources of energy. Titania (TiO2), being lower in cost and easily available, is an exemplary photoanode material used in dye sensitized solar cells (DSSC). The performance of DSSC depends on the trade-off between light harvesting efficiency and charge collection across the photoanode. Much of the contemporary research focuses on tailoring the properties of TiO2 by different approaches that include altering the morphology,4,5 tuning the phase6 or by external doping.7,8 To increase the charge collection ability, TiO2 is synthesized in one-dimensional morphologies, such as nanorods and nanotubes, apart from mesospheres and nanospheres. Although one-dimensional TiO2 nanorods and nanotubes provide a highway for electron conduction, their surface area is still lower with regards to applications in DSSC.9–11 In particular, TiO2 mesospheres and nanospheres have good light scattering ability and high surface area for greater absorption of dye that maximizes the light harvesting capability of TiO2, thereby increasing the photocurrent generation.2,12
Substantial efforts have been focussed on the phase tunable synthesis of TiO2 for improving charge recombination in TiO2. For example, some of us synthesized TiO2 at sub-zero temperatures with different percentages of anatase and rutile phases with an increased solar cell efficiency of 8.6% for the anatase-dominated phase.13 Recently, TiO2, with anatase phase, synthesized with an exposed {001} facet exhibited improved performance in DSSC.14 Another approach adopted for improving the optical properties of TiO2 is by doping it with various metals,8,15–17 non-metals18–21 and metal oxides.22–24 TiO2 with a wide band gap of 3.0–3.2 eV absorbs mainly in the UV region (250–400 nm), which is only a part of the entire solar spectrum. Thus, band gap engineering of TiO2 is important for its effective utilization. For example, the hydrogenation of TiO2 lowers its band gap from 3.2 to 1.8 eV and enhances the solar cell efficiency by 28%.25 Doping in TiO2 not only alters the bandgap, but also helps in improving the charge transfer efficiency.26 An exhaustive literature survey on doping with different metals, semiconductors and dielectrics in TiO2 is provided in ESI, Table S1.† In the case of dielectrics, such as HfO2, Al2O3, and ZrO2, the surface of TiO2 is usually modified with a layer of dielectric material in the form of a core–shell structure to curb the electron recombination process and decrease the electron injection resistance at the electrode–electrolyte interface for the improvement of DSSC.22,27–31 However, the role of HfO2 as a dopant in TiO2 nanosphere have not been explored previously. The electronic shell of Hf in HfO2 ([Xe]4f145d26s2) is loosely bound to the nucleus that can possibly contribute electrons to TiO2 for improved conduction. Moreover, HfO2 with high coordination sphere can offer high surface area and its dielectric nature can contribute towards enhanced optical absorption. Interestingly, the hydrogenation of HfO2 is known to lower its resistance state, which can be utilized in synergy with hydrogenated TiO2. Thus, in this study, TiO2 with finely distributed HfO2 nanodots is synthesized by hydrothermal method and hydrogenated. H-HfO2/TiO2 is compared with H-TiO2 as a photoanode material and several devices have been fabricated. This study emphasizes the feasibility of doping a high coordination sphere dielectric such as HfO2 along with its hydrogenation, resulting in enhanced properties of TiO2 photoactive material in all solar applications. This is clearly illustrated by the enhancement in the efficiency of dye sensitized solar cell by 65% as compared to P25 TiO2.
2. Experimental
2.1 Synthesis of hydrogenated HfO2/TiO2 and TiO2
The samples of TiO2, HfO2/TiO2, H-TiO2 and H-HfO2/TiO2 nanospheres were first prepared via a slightly modified sol–gel hydrothermal method.32 70 mM titanium isopropoxide (TIP) and 4 mM hafnium isopropoxide (HIP) were added dropwise to a mixture of 200 mL ethanol and 1.975 g hexadecylamine (HDA) with vigorous stirring. The mixture was kept undisturbed for 18 h to form a gel and then filtered using a vacuum filter followed by drying at room temperature. 0.8 g sample was dispersed in 10 mL ethanol, 5 mL deionised water and 0.25 mL liquor ammonia. The obtained mixture was transferred to a 20 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and kept at 160 °C for 8 h in an oven. After the completion of the reaction, the resultant product was washed three times with deionized water (DI) and absolute ethanol before drying overnight in a vacuum oven at 70 °C and subsequently calcined at 500 °C for 2 h to obtain HfO2/TiO2 nanospheres. The same procedure was repeated without the addition of HIP, resulting in the synthesis of a white powder of TiO2 nanospheres. These were placed in a quartz boat and heated in a tube furnace under a gas flow of 10% H2 and 90% N2 for 2 h at 500 °C. Hydrogen annealing of TiO2 and HfO2/TiO2 was performed at a heating rate of 2.5 °C min−1 under a constant hydrogen flow, resulting in H-TiO2 and H-HfO2/TiO2, respectively.
2.2 DSSC fabrication
H-HfO2/TiO2 and TiO2 (P25) powders were mixed in an optimized 4:6 ratio13 for the preparation of a photoanode film for which a paste was prepared by uniformly grinding and mixing these powders with ethyl cellulose in α-terpinol and ethanol (weight% ratio: 2.7:1:3.38). The paste was screen printed onto the FTO substrates and dried at 120 °C for 6 min. The procedure for screen printing was repeated five times to increase the layer thickness. The electrodes were sintered at 450 °C for 30 min in air, resulting in a film of ∼10 μm thickness, which was used as such for DSSC fabrication. A similar procedure was adopted for preparing the H-TiO2 photoanode film. The platinum sol was deposited onto the FTO glass substrates and calcined at 450 °C for 30 min to obtain the platinum counter electrode. The photoanodes were soaked in the N3 standard dye (0.5 mM) solution for 18 h and kept in dark. Finally, the soaked photoanodes along with the Pt counter electrode were assembled using a Surlyn spacer, resulting in a sandwich structure. Iodolyte Z50 from Solaronix was used as the electrolyte.
2.3 Characterization
TEM imaging was performed by transmission electron microscopy (FEI Tecnai-G2 T20). For imaging, ∼10 mg of the sample was dispersed in ethanol and drop coated on a copper grid and allowed to dry before imaging. Diffuse reflectance spectra were obtained using a UV-vis spectrophotometer (Varian Cary 4000) with PTFE (polytetrafluoroethylene) as the standard material for baseline correction. The specific surface area was analyzed by N2-adsorption–desorption isotherm (Quantachrome autosorb iQ3). Raman spectra were acquired in the range of 100–1000 cm−1 using a confocal Raman microscope (Renishaw, UK) with a semiconductor diode laser excitation source (0.5% power) at an emission wavelength of 785 nm. A Solar Simulator (model number SS50AA, Photoemission Tech) was used to illuminate the cell under AM 1.5G solar irradiation. An electrochemical workstation (CHI6600) was used for the I–V measurements and EIS analysis. HRTEM images were analysed using ImageJ and Gatan digital micrograph software.
3. Results and discussion
The TiO2 nanospheres doped with HfO2 were synthesized following a slightly modified hydrothermal method, as shown schematically in Fig. 1. Typically, titanium isopropoxide (TIP) precursor was hydrolysed in hexadecylamine (HDA) and aged for 18 h. The HDA–TiO2 lamellar structures are usually formed upon the hydrolysis of TIP. This composite tends to form micelles that polymerize, resulting in the formation of mesoporous inorganic TiO2 nanospheres.33 Upon the addition of TIP to the alcoholic medium, the clear solution instantly turned milky white, giving rise to phase-separated, highly-monodispersed spherical beads. This solution was taken as a precursor for the hydrothermal reaction under the conditions shown in step 2, leading to the formation of crystalline TiO2 nanospheres. The TiO2 powder was hydrogenated by annealing at 500 °C for 2 h under a H2 atmosphere, as seen by the discoloration from white to grey black. In this study, hydrogenated HfO2-doped TiO2 was prepared by introducing hafnium isopropoxide (HIP) as the hafnia precursor along with TIP (starting titania precursor) at different atomic weight ratios of 1%, 5% and 10%, following the same steps as mentioned above (ESI, Fig. S1†). The doping level of HfO2 in TiO2 was optimized to be minimum (1%) because it is an insulating dielectric material with low electron affinity of 2.5 eV. Importantly, the surface area of HfO2/TiO2 with 1% doping increases compared to TiO2, as expected (Fig. S2†). The hydrogenated sample with 1% HfO2 doped in TiO2 was used for further studies.
 Fig. 1  Schematic diagram demonstrating the synthesis method for hydrogenated TiO2 nanospheres doped with HfO2 nanodots. 
The morphology and structural composition of H-HfO2/TiO2 were characterized, as shown in Fig. 2. Owing to the low doping percentage of HfO2, no significant change in the peak position was observed in the XRD pattern (ESI, Fig. S3†). The TEM image in Fig. 2a indicates the formation of uniformly distributed nanospheres and is similar to that of H-TiO2 (ESI, Fig. S4†). The mean diameter of a single nanosphere of H-HfO2/TiO2 is 470 ± 2 nm (Fig. 2a, inset). A nanosphere consisted of crystallites of size ∼12 nm (Fig. 2b). The HRTEM image shows a lattice spacing of 0.35 nm corresponding to the (101) plane of TiO2 anatase (Fig. 2c). The marked area at the edge of particle exhibited a Moiré pattern, which was examined carefully by FFT, as shown in the inset of Fig. 2c. The electron diffraction (ED) pattern exhibits concentric rings that were indexed to the lattice planes (101), (103), (200), (105) and (213), corresponding to the anatase phase of TiO2 (Fig. 2d). HfO2 could not be identified by ED and HRTEM; however, the EDS spectrum shows signals corresponding to Hf M, Ti K, and O L due to the presence of HfO2 in TiO2 (Fig. 2e). The EDS map of Hf in Fig. 2e shows nanodots in the area enclosed by the TiO2 nanosphere (Fig. 2f and g), which infers the presence of ultrasmall but monodispersed HfO2 nanodots in TiO2. The doping of HfO2 nanodots as well as hydrogenation has a direct influence on the optical properties of TiO2. As shown schematically in Fig. 3a, the optical path length is increased by the introduction of HfO2 nanodots in TiO2, resulting in higher scattering. Fig. 3b and c show the optical reflection spectra and corresponding band gap for TiO2 after doping with HfO2 and upon hydrogenation. The incorporation of HfO2 nanodots in small quantities (1%) has little influence on the optical absorption and in turn, the optical band gap of TiO2 (3.18 eV), as shown in Fig. 3b. To extend the optical absorption in the visible region, HfO2/TiO2 is annealed in hydrogen, as shown in Fig. 1 (step IV). Hydrogen annealing of TiO2 extends its light absorption towards the visible region due to the formation of sub band gap states between the conduction and valence bands with the formation of oxygen vacancy sites.34 The generation of defects leads to lattice disorientation.1,35–37 However, hydrogenation of HfO2 in TiO2 is not very well studied. The UV-vis diffuse reflection spectrum of HfO2/TiO2 is flat and featureless in the visible (400–800 nm) region; however, the reflection decreases drastically upon hydrogenation, as shown in Fig. 3b. The decrease is more than the hydrogenated TiO2 indicating clear hydrogenation of HfO2 as well. In the case of TiO2, the band gap is known to decrease upon hydrogenation due to the presence of oxygen vacancies and Ti3+ sites in the crystal structure.38 Similarly, the optical band gap of HfO2/TiO2 decreases from ∼3.18 to ∼2.4 eV upon hydrogenation (Fig. 3c). The effect of HfO2 doping on band gap is negligible under air annealed conditions; however, it is clearly visible in hydrogenated samples (Fig. 3d). Owing to the high coordination sphere of HfO2, the defect density in H-HfO2/TiO2 increases, as shown by the Raman spectra (Fig. S5†). There is a shift in the stretching mode of the Eg peak from 146 to 151 cm−1 due to the induced defects and possible disorientation in the lattice structure upon the hydrogenation of HfO2 in TiO2. The optical reflection for H-HfO2/TiO2 compared to TiO2 (inset, Fig. 3d) is remarkably lowered, possibly due to the increased optical scattering by hydrogenated HfO2, resulting in a lowered band gap of 2.4 eV. However, compared to H-TiO2 (2.0 eV), the bandgap for H-HfO2/TiO2 is still lower, which might be important for the enhancement of the visible light absorption for solar cell application.

The cross-sectional view of the DSSCs fabricated using H-HfO2/TiO2 nanospheres is shown in Fig. 4a. This represents the layer-by-layer arrangement of the photoanode to be used in the fabrication of DSSC. The magnified SEM image at the cross-section is slightly uneven at the edge (Fig. 4a; right); however, an in-depth focus shows the tightly packed morphology of the deposited film. A schematic of the complete sandwich structure of DSSC is shown in Fig. S6.† Fig. 4b shows the J–V characteristics of the DSSC based on H-HfO2/TiO2, H-TiO2 and P25 TiO2. The corresponding photovoltaic parameters are detailed in Table 1. The H-HfO2/TiO2 photoanode based DSSC has a strikingly higher current density, JSC of 21.74 mA cm−2 with a nominal VOC of 0.66 V compared to H-TiO2. As seen from the data, the H-HfO2/TiO2-based DSSC exhibits an enhanced photo-conversion efficiency of 8.6%, whereas H-TiO2 and P25 TiO2 show 5.9% and 5.2% efficiency under similar conditions. This is an intriguing result and probably occurs due to the enhanced light absorption (discussed in Fig. 3), higher surface area (Fig. S7†), and lower recombination rate. From the BET measurements in Fig. S8,† the surface area of H-HfO2/TiO2 was calculated to be higher (74.21 m2 g−1) compared to H-TiO2 (56.186 m2 g−1). The surface area effect was studied by calculating the amount of dye loaded on the photoanode and deloading it using a NaOH solution. The H-HfO2/TiO2 photoanode relatively soaked 35% more dye than H-TiO2. The detailed calculation along with the absorbance diagram is given in ESI, Fig. S7†. This shows that H-HfO2/TiO2 offers a higher surface area thus contributing to the increased efficiency.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were performed for DSSCs based on H-HfO2/TiO2 and H-TiO2 in the frequency range between 1 and 105 Hz under 1 sun illumination for understanding the electron recombination and interfacial charge transfer processes. The Nyquist plots in Fig. 4c show three semicircles in the complex plane that represent the interface resistance between the photoanode and electrolyte. The plots were fitted to an equivalent circuit consisting of a series resistance (RS), Pt–electrolyte capacitance, a charge transfer resistance in the counter electrode and the electrolyte interface (R1 and R2) and a Warburg resistance, W, due to ion transfer in the electrolyte.39,40 The parameters, RS, R1, R2, and W, are listed in Table S2.† The impedance Bode phase plots in Fig. 4d display a frequency peak (ωmax) that corresponds to various charge transfer processes occurring in DSSCs. The Bode plot for H-TiO2 ωmax shifted from 29.10 Hz to 19.54 Hz due to the hydrogenation of HfO2 in H-HfO2/TiO2. The ωmax is inversely related to the electron lifetime (τn = 1/ωmax). A decrease in the value of ωmax in DSSC based on H-HfO2/TiO2 indicates a decrease in charge recombination compared to H-TiO2. The electron lifetime τn was calculated using the formula, τn = (R1 × C1), where R1 and C1 are the charge transfer resistance and chemical capacitance.26 H-HfO2/TiO2 was found to have higher τn value (0.142 ms) than H-TiO2 (0.056 ms). This is a significant increase in the electron lifetime, which leads to a reduction in charge recombination in the fabricated device. Thus, a longer electron lifetime (τn) and high R1 value for the H-HfO2/TiO2-based DSSC result in improved JSC values. The effect of different HfO2 loadings and optimization of the hydrogenation conditions will be carried out in future studies for further improving the performance of these devices.
4. Conclusions
Hydrogenated TiO2 doped with HfO2 nanodots were prepared by a combination of sol–gel and hydrothermal methods. HfO2 nanodots increase the defect density upon hydrogenation and shift the optical absorption of H-HfO2/TiO2 from IR towards the visible region. This is clearly seen from an increase in band gap from 2.03 eV to 2.4 eV. Owing to the increased surface area, there is a clear enhancement in the dye uptake capability of H-HfO2/TiO2 (10.1 × 10−9 mol cm−2) compared to H-TiO2. The DSSC fabricated using H-HfO2/TiO2 with an optimal band gap of 2.4 eV exhibits an efficiency of 8.6% with a photocurrent density of 21.7 mA cm−2. This may be due to the optical light trapping effects and the enhanced surface area of TiO2 with the addition of HfO2 nanodots and its hydrogenation.
