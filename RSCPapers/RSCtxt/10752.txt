    , Accepted 4th April 2023First published on 18th April 2023AbstractIn kesterite Cu2ZnSn(S, Se)4 (CZTSSe) solar cells, the insufficient CdS/CZTSSe heterojunction built-in electric field due to the low carrier concentration is an important factor limiting the photoelectric conversion performance. Herein, we introduce an extrinsic La3+ incorporation to realize a synergetic carrier doping of this heterojunction. By forming shallow LaCd and LaSn substitution defects, electron and hole concentration in CdS and kesterite has been obviously increased, which effectively improves the electric property and interface charge transfer of the heterojunction. The resulting reduction in the minority carrier loss has finally realized a high cell efficiency of 13.9% at room temperature. Moreover, the carrier doping allows the heterojunction to work in a much wider temperature region and the cell obtains an impressively high efficiency of 22% at 130 K.
Introduction
Kesterite Cu2ZnSn(S, Se)4 (CZTSSe) has attracted more and more attention as a promising photovoltaics material due to its earth-abundant and non-toxic element components. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of CZTSSe solar cells has experienced a continuous growth in the past two decades and currently has reached a record of 13.0%.1 Nevertheless, the cell performance is still limited by the large open-circuit voltage (VOC) deficit. Besides the widely known non-radiative charge loss arising from deep defects, the low hole concentration of the CZTSSe absorber layer and its induced insufficient CdS/CZTSSe heterojunction built-in electric field also act as an important origin accounting for the VOC deficit.2,3 In most of the reported efficient cells, the hole concentration in CZTSSe is of the order of 1015 cm−3.1,2,4,5 This value is obviously lower than that in similarly structured Cu(In, Ga)Se2 and CdTe solar cells, in which a hole concentration of 1016 cm−3 is usually needed.6–8
The hole carriers in CZTSSe mainly arise from the intrinsic element self-doping, such as Cu vacancy (VCu) and Cu/Zn antisite (CuZn) point defects.9,10 However, these shallow acceptors are easily compensated by the donor defects such as the Zn/Cu (ZnCu) and Sn/Zn (SnZn) antisites and the Se vacancy (VSe) by forming defect complexes.11,12 The further enhancement of the hole concentration through compositional control is also limited by the stringent phase formation condition and crystallization growth requirements of CZTSSe.13,14 In addition, the dependence of the formation energy of the donor-type deep defects on the Fermi energy level demands the avoidance of high hole doping in the CZTSSe high-temperature fabrication process.12 Although alkali metal (Na, Li) doping is generally considered capable of increasing hole density by providing shallow acceptor defect such as VCu and LiZn,15–18 its ability to increase the hole concentration is not up to expectations.17,19 Overall, under current CZTSSe fabrication conditions, the regulation of hole concentration through the intrinsic self-doping approach has been restricted by many factors.15,17,20,21
Post-treatment using extrinsic element doping, such as atom diffusion and ion implantation, is also an important route to realize carrier regulation. This strategy has been widely applied in the fabrication of high-performance CdTe and Si solar cells because of its advantages in the diversity of element choice and the higher process controllability.22–25 In CZTSSe solar cells, In3+ post-treatment had been previously explored to realize this purpose by partially substituting Sn atoms, which indeed achieved a significant improvement in the cell VOC.26 However, due to the similar size between In3+ and the cations in the CdS/CZTSSe heterojunction, cation diffusion and substitution kinetics are too fast to be precisely controlled.
Herein, we introduce a large-size lanthanum cation (La3+) to regulate the carrier doping of the CdS/kesterite heterojunction by a post-treatment approach. La is initially deposited on CdS in the form of La(OH)x using a successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) method and is subsequently incorporated into CdS and kesterite by a heat treatment. The amount of La incorporation can be easily controlled by SILAR cycles. The concentration of electrons in CdS and holes in kesterite can be synergistically increased by forming La/Cd (LaCd) and La/Sn (LaSn) substitution doping. This has obviously improved the electric property and the interface carrier transfer of the CdS/kesterite heterojunction, and finally achieved a champion cell PCE of 13.9% (certified PCE: 13.53%) with a VOC enhancement of about 50 mV.
Experimental
Materials
CuCl (99.999%, Alfa), Zn(CH3COO)2 (99.99%, Aladdin), SnCl4 (99.998%, Macklin), AgCl (99.5%, Innochem), thiourea (99.99%, Aladdin, recrystallized twice), 2-methoxyethanol (MOE, 99.8%, Aladdin), Se pellets (99.999%, Zhong Nuo Advanced Material), CdSO4·8/3H2O (99.99%, Aladdin), ammonium chloride (≥99.5%, Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd), ammonium hydroxide (25.0–28.0%, Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd), lanthanum chloride hexahydrate (99.99%, Aladdin) and sodium hydroxide (Analytical Reagent, AR, Beijing Tongguang) were used to prepare precursor solutions. The chemicals were used directly without further purification.
Film fabrication
The precursor solution was prepared as follows: CuCl, Zn(CH3COO)2, SnCl4 and thiourea were dissolved in MOE and stirred at 60 °C for an hour to obtain a colorless solution, then AgCl was dissolved in the solution for another an hour to get a final colorless solution (MOE-air-precursor). The molar ratios of (Ag + Cu)/(Zn + Sn), Zn/Sn and thiourea/metal were 0.75, 1.12 and 1.7, respectively, and the concentrations of metal elements and thiourea were 1.88 mol L−1 and 3.20 mol L−1. The Ag-alloyed CZTSSe (ACZTSSe) precursor films were prepared by spin-coating the precursor solution on cleaned Mo substrates at a spin speed of 3000 rpm for 25 s, followed by annealing on a 280 °C hot plate in air. The coating and annealing processes were repeated several times for desired 1.2–1.5 μm thickness precursor films. Then, as-prepared precursor films were annealed with N2 flow in a selenium-containing graphite box, which was put inside a rapid heating tube furnace. The temperature was raised to 535 °C in 60 s directly, held for 1300 s, and finally naturally cooled.
Device fabrication
A device structure with Mo/ACZTSSe/CdS/La(OH)x/ZnO/ITO/Ni/Al/MgF2 was fabricated successively using an ACZTSSe layer derived from selenization towards spin-coated precursor film, chemical-bath-deposited CdS buffer layer, several SILRA cycles of La(OH)x, RF magnetron-sputtered i-ZnO combined with indium tin oxide (ITO) window layers under 200 °C annealing1 and thermally evaporated Ni/Al collection grid and MgF2 anti-reflection layer.
Film and device characterization
AFM and KPFM images were obtained with a Bruker Multimode 9. XPS measurement was carried out with an ESCALAB 250Xi (Themo Fisher) instrument. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were obtained by a scanning electron microscope (Oxford JSM7610F). Raman spectra were collected by a Raman spectrometer (Lab-RAM HR Evolution, HORIBA) using a 532 nm excitation laser with a power of 6 mW. XRD patterns were obtained using an X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα as the radiation source (Empyrean, PANalytical). STEM-EDX mapping and STEM-EELS were conducted with a transmission electron microscope (ARM200F, JEOL Inc.) equipped with a Gatan Quantum ER965 imaging filter operating at 200 kV. UPS was measured with a Thermo Scientific ESCALab250Xi. Thermal admittance spectroscopy was carried out with a VersaSTAT 3 electrochemical workstation of Princeton Applied Research in the temperature range of 130–300 K in the dark (frequency: 0.1–106 Hz; amplitude: 10 mV; DC bias: 0 V). DLCP, C–V and temperature-dependent J–V were measured with an electrochemical workstation (Princeton, Versa STAT). TPL was performed with a PL spectrometer (FLS 900) by exciting with a picosecond-pulsed diode laser (EPL-640) of 638.2 nm wavelength and cooling down with liquid helium. M-TPC/TPV spectra were obtained using our lab-made setup, in which the cell was excited by a 532 nm pulsed laser (Brio, 20 Hz, 4 ns) and the photovoltage decay process was recorded by a digital oscilloscope (Tektronix, DPO 7104). J–V curves of cells were collected using a Keithley 2400 source meter under AM1.5G illumination (100 mW cm−2) from a solar simulator (Zolix SS150A). The intensity of the light source was calibrated by a standard silicon solar cell certified by NIMC (National Institute of Metrology, China). The reference cell was certified by NIMC. Spectral mismatch was calculated by NIMC. The measurement was performed at room temperature (25 °C) in air, with a scanning rate of 130 mV s−1 from −0.05 V to 0.6 V with a step of 6.5 mV and without dwell time. EQE was obtained from an Enlitech QE-R test system with a xenon lamp and a bromine tungsten lamp as light sources. Device simulation was performed with SCAPS-1D. The details of parameter setup for simulations are shown in ESI.† Elemental depth compositional profiles of devices were determined by secondary-ion mass spectroscopy (ToF-SIMS 5, Germany ION-ToF GmbH). For comparison, a Cs− beam with an impact energy of 2 keV was used as excitation source.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was based on the parameters (PCE, VOC, JSC, FF) of 12 devices under the same testing conditions (i.e. in air, room temperature). All data were presented as mean ± standard error of the mean. The sample size (n) for each statistical analysis was the same with a total area (0.28 cm2) for device efficiency measurement. Data were analysed and processed by Excel software.
Results and discussion
The scheme of the ACZTSSe solar cell is shown in Fig. 1a, with La being introduced on the CdS surface in the form of La(OH)x using a SILAR method. This method has been widely applied for nanometer-level film fabrication, such as quantum dot deposition.27 In one cycle of the SILAR as shown in Fig. 1b, La3+ is firstly adsorbed on the CdS film surface through La–S interaction. The following water rinsing step removes the loosely bound species of La3+ on the surface to ensure a quasi-single layer ion adsorption. After reacting with NaOH solution, an La(OH)x single layer is expected to form. Finally, unreacted Na+ and OH− ions are removed by rinsing with water again. Repeating this cycle, La(OH)x with increasing thickness can be deposited on CdS. For clarity, the samples in the following will be labelled according to their SILAR cycles; for example, La-5 means the sample is deposited by five SILAR cycles and La-0 is the control sample without La deposition. The incorporation of La from La(OH)x into the CdS/ACZTSSe heterojunction is subsequently realized by heat annealing.1 This heat treatment for the CdS/ACZTSSe heterojunction has been widely adopted in fabrication of high-efficiency CZTS/ACZTSSe solar cells.28–30

Surface morphology of the CdS/ACZTSSe layer without and with La deposition (La-5) was measured by AFM, as presented in Fig. 1c and Fig. S1.† It can be seen that height difference between grains is decreased and grain boundary becomes less clear after La(OH)x deposition, which implies that La(OH)x has indeed been deposited. SEM images of the CdS films with or without La(OH)x are also shown in Fig. S2 and S3.† XPS has confirmed the existence of La on the film surface and the interaction of CdS and La (Fig. 1d and S4, ESI†). La 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 peaks are recorded at 834.7 eV and 851.8 eV, respectively, and their characteristic shake-up satellite peaks can be clearly seen in the spectrum. Complete cells with varied La deposition cycles have been fabricated and the statistics of the cell performance are shown in Fig. 1e–h. The average total-area PCE has been improved from 12.6% to 13.5% after a five-cycle La deposition, in which the enhancement in VOC makes the major contribution. For the champion cell group, the averaged VOC reaches 542 mV, which is amongst the highest results reported so far. The average FF exhibits a slight increase in the La-2 cell group but gradually decreases when more SILAR cycles are performed. This may arise because the deposited insulating La(OH)x influences the carrier transport at the CdS/ZnO interface (Fig. S5, ESI†). Overall, the incorporation of La has provided a simple and controllable heterojunction regulation approach to significantly improve VOC and PCE for kesterite solar cells.
To reveal the mechanism of VOC enhancement, the form of La present in the ACZTSSe and CdS layers is first characterized. In the XRD patterns shown in Fig. 2a, a slight shift of the ACZTSSe (112) peak toward low-angle direction can be clearly seen after La incorporation, which means that larger La3+ cation has entered into the ACZTSSe lattice by substituting a metal site. Raman scattering spectroscopy is used to characterize the CdS layer and the scattering peaks at about 300 and 600 cm−1 arising from longitudinal optical phonons of CdS can be clearly seen in Fig. 2b. In the spectra, La has obviously enhanced the Raman scattering intensity and also slightly shifted the peaks toward higher-wavenumber direction. This implies that La cation has also inserted into the CdS lattice and most probably substituted Cd atoms. More details about XRD and Raman spectra are given in Fig. S6 and S7.† We performed a more detailed study on the distribution of La in the heterojunction using scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). In the HAADF image shown in Fig. 2c, a thin layer with a lower transmission contrast can be observed between ZnO and CdS layers, which could be the deposited La(OH)x because O and H have much lower atomic number. The cross-sectional EDX mapping image indicates that La does not localize at the interface but has diffused into the CdS and ACZTSSe layers, forming a dispersion distribution (Fig. 2d). Other evidence of La-diffusion is provided by the time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (Tof-SIMS) results of the La-5 device shown in Fig. S8.† EELS measurement also confirms the existence of La in the CdS and ACZTSSe layers. The La M4,5 EELS signals detected from three different positions located in the La(OH)x interface layer (region 1), CdS (region 2) and ACZTSSe (region 3), respectively, are presented in Fig. 2e for a further comparison. The M4,5 EELS signal is a characteristic peak of the 3d core-level electron transition of La atom (cation) and has a high detection sensitivity.31,32 In region 1, La M4,5 peaks locate at 836.9 and 854.5 eV. In comparison, a shift in the EELS peaks in lower-energy and higher-energy directions has been observed in region 2 and region 3, respectively. This means that the outer-shell electron environment of La in these two regions is different from that in region 1 since the chemical shift of EELS peak is usually related to the valence state of a metal element.33,34 The lower-energy shift in region 2 implies that La has occupied Cd sites in CdS, which makes La exhibit a +2 valence. Similarly, the higher-energy shift in region 3 indicates that La has exhibited a +4 valence by occupying Sn sites of ACZTSSe. That is, the SILAR deposition and annealing process has realized a synergetic doping of the CdS/ACZTSSe heterojunction. Since the heterojunction annealing is performed at a relatively low temperature (200 °C), we think that Cd or Sn vacancies that initially existed in CdS and ACZTSSe provide the pathway for LaCd and LaSn doping. Different from introducing dopants in a high-temperature fabrication process, this low-temperature doping and its induced Fermi energy level shift would not change the self-doping properties of other atoms, such as the Cu–Zn disorder and SnZn antisite defects.

Compared to Cd in CdS, La doping could introduce an unpaired electron in its 5d orbit. The 5d electron usually has a large delocalization distribution and thus could help realize electron doping of CdS. We used a Kelvin probe force microscope (KPFM) to characterize the work function of the doped CdS films. It is found that the CPD between the probe tip and the film sample is increased after La doping, which indicates the work function of CdS is increased after La doping (Fig. 3a). The CPD result of these samples is given in Fig. 3b, which all exhibit a narrow quasi-Gaussian distribution. Compared to the control CdS, CPD of the La-5 sample is increased by about 80 mV. When more La is incorporated in the La-10 sample, the CPD increase can reach 145 mV. We also fabricated an La-20 sample for CPD measurement, in which the film surface is almost completely covered by La(OH)x. In this sample, the CPD reaches 480 mV, much different from that of other samples. This means that the CPD increase measured in La-5 and La-10 samples mainly arises from the upward shift of Fermi energy level of the CdS layer due to La doping rather than arising from the La(OH)x itself. The ΔEf-VBM (‘ΔEf-VBM = |VBM − Ef|) of La-5 sample is 0.11 eV larger than ΔEf-VBM of control CdS sample, as shown in Fig. 3c, which indicates that the CdS Fermi energy level of La-5 sample is upwardly shifted by 0.11 eV relative to the VBM and closer to the CBM. This similarity between the valence-band spectra and the CPD results on the one hand confirms that the electron doping of CdS has indeed been realized and on the other hand indicates that the energy band position of CdS has not been obviously changed after La doping.

We further study the electric properties of the doped ACZTSSe since the LaSn doping could introduce a valence electron-deficit environment. In ACZTSSe, the metal atom adopts sp3 hybridization to interact with four chalcogenide atoms. Because of the large atom size of La, its sp3 hybridization orbitals have a large overlap with the p orbital of Se (or S) atom and consequently could form a nonlocalized acceptor level in ACZTSSe. We use TAS to characterize the defect properties of ACZTSSe. In the defect density (Nt)–defect energy (Eω) spectra as shown in Fig. 4a and b, it can be seen that La-5 sample exhibits a much wider Nt–Eω distribution compared to that of the control sample.35–37 Besides the similar Nt distribution in the high defect energy regime (0.08 eV), La-5 sample exhibits a new Nt distribution in the low defect energy regime (0.05 eV), implying an additional defect energy level caused by La doping. At temperatures over 200 K, no obvious defect response can be further observed in the capacitance-f spectra, which means that these detected defects are all shallow acceptors and very easy to ionize.35,36,38 The Arrhenius plots exhibit that these two samples have a similar defect ionization energy (Et) of 0.11 and 0.076 eV, respectively, which can be attributed to VCu or CuZn shallow acceptors.9,39 For the La-5 sample, the new additional shallow acceptor has an Et of about 0.045 eV, which could arise from the LaSn defects (Fig. S9 and S10, ESI†). Due to the additional LaSn acceptor, the doped sample exhibits an obviously higher Nt. At room temperature, these acceptor defects will ionize to form more free holes in ACZTSSe. The DLCP measured at room temperature in Fig. 4c demonstrates that the hole concentration of ACZTSSe has been increased by about five times, from 3 × 1015 of the control to 1.4 × 1016 cm−3 of La-5 cells (C–V curves, Mott–Schottky plot and C–V profiles are shown in Fig. S11 and S12, ESI†).

These results illustrate that La incorporation has realized a synergetic carrier doping of the ACZTSSe/CdS heterojunction, which should be able to enhance the built-in electric potential (Vbi) and thus VOC of ACZTSSe solar cells. According to these measurement results, we conducted a device simulation of the ACZTSSe solar cells (more details for simulation and J–V simulation are given in Table S1 and Fig. S13, ESI†).40 As shown in Fig. 4d, the La-doped ACZTSSe/CdS heterojunction has a larger band bending and this cell also exhibits a larger quasi-Fermi level splitting, which could give a higher upper limit of VOC. In addition, the increased carrier concentration narrows the energy barrier at the ACZTSSe/CdS interface, which should be able to promote interfacial carrier transport. TPL has been used to evaluate the carrier transfer dynamics in the heterojunction (Fig. 4e and f).29,41,42 At low temperatures, the photoinduced carriers mainly locate in the band tail states and the electron transfer from ACZTSSe to CdS is realized through the built-in electric field induced drift and tunneling. It can be seen that the doped sample exhibits a much shorter PL lifetime, indicating a faster carrier separation and transfer. This faster carrier transfer dynamics would shorten the time duration that the photoinduced electrons stay in the ACZTSSe absorber layer and thus could reduce the loss of the minority electrons.
Similar result is also found in the photocurrent decay curves as shown in Fig. 4g. Specifically, for the La-5 cell, the photocurrent decay time is approximately 0.68 μs under 0 bias, which is shorter than the 0.91 μs of the control cell. From modulated transient photocurrent and photovoltage (M-TPC/TPV) measurement, the bias voltage-dependent charge extraction (ηext) and charge collection (ηC) efficiencies are further extracted to evaluate the charge loss of the cells.43–45 As shown in Fig. 4h, these two cells exhibit similar ηC in the entire voltage regime, while the La-doped cell has a much higher ηext. This means that the loss of photoinduced electrons in the ACZTSSe absorber has indeed been suppressed due to faster carrier transfer. The higher hole concentration and larger Vbi could also decrease the reverse saturated current density (J0) of the CdS/ACZTSSe heterojunction. We suggest that the reduced loss of photoinduced electrons and the suppressed J0 are the two reasons for the PCE enhancement achieved by La doping.
The J–V characteristics of the champion cells are shown in Fig. 5a. The La-5 cell has a highest PCE of 13.9% with JSC of 35.8 mA cm−2, VOC of 550 mV and FF of 0.71. The certified PCE reaches 13.53% with JSC of 35.7 mA cm−2, VOC of 548 mV and FF of 0.69 (Fig. S14, ESI†). In comparison, the control cell has a PCE of only 12.8% with a much lower VOC of 496 mV. Specifically, J0 derived from the J–V curves of the La-5 champion cell is 2.45 × 10−8 A cm−2, which is smaller than the 8.67 × 10−8 A cm−2 of the control cell.46 According to the EQE of the cell (Fig. 5b), the bandgap (Eg) is determined to be 1.11 eV. Thus, the VOC deficit (Eg/q − VOC) of the La-5 cell is calculated to be 0.56 V, which is 54 mV smaller than that of the control cell. Temperature-dependent I–V measurement is further conducted to understand the electric property of the CdS/ACZTSSe heterojunction. Both of these cells behave like an ideal diode in the entire experiment temperature region (100–300 K) and their VOC shows a continuous increase when the temperature decreases. The activation energy EA is further obtained by extrapolating VOC to 0 K using the ideal diode model.47 The EA of the La-5 cell is 1 eV, which is 50 meV larger than that of the control cell. This increase of EA may come from the reduction in the carrier transfer barrier at the CdS/ACZTSSe interface. The PCE of the control cell increases when the temperature decreases from 300 K to 190 K but exhibits an obvious decrease when the temperature is lower than 190 K due to the collapse in FF. The insufficient heterojunction carrier density and the undesirable band alignment could be the main reasons (Fig. S15, ESI†). In contrast, the La-doped cell exhibits a continuous PCE enhancement in almost the entire temperature region and reaches the highest value of 22% at 130 K. The PCE is about 70% higher than that of the cell at room temperature. This enhancement degree is much higher than that achieved in an In-doped cell (about 30%)26 and that of a perovskite solar cell measured at 130 K.48 These results demonstrate that the La doping has produced a superior CdS/ACZTSSe heterojunction, which can sustain the heterojunction electric property in a wider temperature region.

Conclusions
In this work, we introduce La to realize a synergetic doping of a CdS/kesterite heterojunction to overcome the carrier concentration limit of kesterite solar cells. The SILAR method adopted here ensures precise control of the amount of La incorporation. The occurrence of LaCd and LaSn substitutions induced by heterojunction annealing has obviously enhanced electron and hole doping of CdS and ACZTSSe, respectively. The higher carrier concentration improves electric property and interface charge transfer of the heterojunction. This has significantly reduced the minority carrier loss in the cell and sustained photoelectric conversion ability of the heterojunction in a much wider temperature region. With these efforts, high PCEs of 13.9% and 22% have been achieved at room temperature and 130 K, respectively, which are amongst the highest results reported so far. As such, this work provides a promising pathway to boost the performance of kesterite solar cells.
