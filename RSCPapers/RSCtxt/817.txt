    , Accepted 23rd April 2015First published on 23rd April 2015AbstractIn this work, composite core–shell ZnO/TiO2 materials were fabricated by deposition of TiO2 layers via a sol–gel method onto ZnO nanorods hydrothermally grown on an ITO electrode. Two approaches to the sol–gel procedure resulted in strongly different morphologies and thicknesses of the deposited TiO2 layer, as shown in electron microscopy studies. The decrease of the optical band gap energies of the ZnO/TiO2 composites by about 0.2–0.3 eV with respect to the TiO2 nanoparticles and ZnO nanorods was determined from UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectra. The photocatalytic activities of the systems were determined by investigation of the decolorization of Methylene Blue (MB) in aqueous solution, irradiated with monochromatic light (LED, 400 nm). Depending on the TiO2 layer morphology, and therefore the accessibility of the ZnO/TiO2 heterojunction, the photocatalytic activities of the ZnO/TiO2 composite systems showed 2-fold and 6-fold higher efficiency than that of the non-covered ZnO system. Addition of a small amount of methanol (3% v/v) to the MB test solution resulted in a significant drop in performance of all the ZnO/TiO2 samples, suggesting that the photodegradation mechanism proceeds mostly via photogenerated holes and less likely via photoexcited electrons. Photoelectrochemical tests of ITO/ZnO/TiO2 electrodes carried out in an acetonitrile solution containing ferrocene as a redox probe showed an increase in photocurrents in comparison to ITO/ZnO electrodes upon illumination with a xenon arc lamp.
1. Introduction
Nanostructured metal oxides, such as TiO2, WO3, and ZnO, have attracted increased interest over the last decade due to their practical applications in piezoelectric nanodevices,1 photocatalysis,2–6 water purification,7,8 water splitting,9 self-cleaning,10,11 and solar cells.12–14 Since the mentioned oxides are wide-band-gap semiconductors (Eg > 3 eV) and absorb in the UV range, great effort has been made to shift their absorbance onset towards visible light. This goal may be achieved by modification of the electronic structure of the semiconductor via doping with metal cations15 or non-metal anions (N, S, F),16–19 but on the other hand, these changes may also deteriorate the photoactivity of the doped material.20 There are also several reports indicating that the intimate mixing of anatase and rutile TiO2 to obtain a composite causes a synergic enhancement in photocatalysis due to the separation of photogenerated charge carriers and the reduction of electron–hole recombination, owing to a small difference (0.2 eV) in the positions of the conduction bands of these two phases.21–24
Improved photoactivity of bicomponent materials, with respect to that of the single components, has been also reported for TiO2/ZnO systems, in which ZnO nanoparticles were deposited on TiO2 nanotubes,25–27 nanorods28 or nanocrystals,29,30 as well as for ZnO nanorods covered with a thin layer of TiO2 nanoparticles.31–33 Taking into account the stability of the photocatalytic system, the arrangement in which ZnO is covered with a uniform TiO2 layer seems to be most suitable because such a coating may protect the ZnO, which is more vulnerable than TiO2 to photocorrosion, against its degradation. Improvement of the catalytic properties of the hybrid system is achieved due to correct alignment of the energy levels of the components. Although the band gap energies of ZnO and TiO2 are similar (3.37 eV for ZnO,34 3.22 eV for anatase TiO2),35 the conduction and valence bands of ZnO are located a little above (by about 0.48 eV, i.e. more negative on the electrochemical scale) the corresponding bands of TiO2.36 Therefore, the electrons photogenerated in ZnO are transferred into TiO2, enhancing catalytic reactions on its surface.37,38 On the other hand, the holes are injected into the valence band of ZnO. These charge separation phenomena can also suppress unwanted charge (electron–hole) recombination.39
So far, numerous approaches have been reported for ZnO/TiO2 preparation, e.g. electrospinning coupled either with pulse deposition40 or hydrothermal synthesis,41 a spin coating technique,42 atomic layer deposition,43 or radio frequency magnetron sputtering.44 Most of these rely on the use of expensive apparatus and devices, making preparation less economically attractive. In this work we applied a simple and low-cost sol–gel method to develop reproducible procedures, allowing the formation of TiO2 thin layers of various but controlled thicknesses and morphologies (either rugged or compact) on ZnO nanorods grown on ITO by a hydrothermal method. Recently, a few reports have been published on the sol–gel deposition of TiO2 on the surface of ZnO nanostructures supported on electrodes.45,46 As presented therein, a significant influence on the optical and electrochemical properties was attributed to the morphology of the TiO2 layers and the amount of deposited TiO2. A deep understanding of the relationship between the morphology and properties of ZnO/TiO2 systems is of key importance for their practical applications. Therefore, further development of the sol–gel procedure presented in this work was aimed at obtaining core–shell materials of controlled TiO2 thickness, morphology and optical properties. The obtained ZnO/TiO2 composite systems were characterized with the use of numerous physicochemical techniques: SEM (scanning electron microscopy), TEM (transmission electron microscopy), TG-DSC (thermogravimetry and differential scanning calorimetry), XRD (X-ray diffraction), XPS (X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy), and UV-Vis spectroscopy. The photoelectrochemical properties of the ITO/ZnO/TiO2 systems were studied by cyclic voltammetry, while the photocatalytic properties with respect to MB degradation with and without addition of methanol were investigated by means of UV-Vis spectroscopy. Taking into account the requirements and demands for photocatalysts, we demonstrate that the systems proposed in this work have considerable potential in this field of applications as well as in photovoltaics as photoanodes.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Materials
Titanium(IV) butoxide (TiB) (reagent grade, 97%), Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (98%), ethanol (≥99.5%), 2-propanol (assay ≥ 99.9%), acetonitrile (≥99.9%), LiClO4 (>95%), and methanol (≥99%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Ferrocene (>98% Fe) was provided by Fluka Chemika, whereas Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O (≥99.5%), NH3·H2O (≥23%), and methylene blue (MB) (C16H18N3SCl, >95%) were provided by ROTH. All chemicals were used as delivered, without further purification. Aqueous solutions were prepared using deionized water (Millipore, of specific resistivity 18 MΩ cm). All pH measurements were performed with the use of a Microprocessor pH meter HI-221 (Hanna Instruments, France). ITO (Indium Tin Oxide) conducting glass of sheet resistance 20 Ω □−1 was obtained from Prazisions Glass & Optik GmbH (Germany).
2.2. Instruments and characterization methods
Field-emission scanning electron microscopes JEOL JSM-7600F (Japan) equipped with EDS SDD Oxford Instruments and Carl Zeiss Merlin (Germany) were used to determine the morphologies of the samples at an operating voltage of 15 kV, and also to determine the Ti:Zn ratios. TEM measurements were performed with a JEOL JEM-2100 200 kV and a Zeiss Libra 120 kV. In order to determine the accessible surface area in both the ZnO/TiO2 samples, a two-step procedure was applied. Firstly, the amount of Zn/ZnO-seeded ITO substrate was carefully weighed with the use of a sensitive microbalance, and then again after the hydrothermal growth of ZnO nanorods. Taking into account the much lower amount of TiO2 deposited compared to ZnO, EDX analysis of a large sample area was carried out to determine accurate Ti:Zn ratios. Secondly, to determine the accessible surface area of ITO/ZnO and ZnO/TiO2, the samples were placed inside two separate containers with the same volumes of 20 μM MB solutions. After 24 h of conditioning in the dark, the samples were taken out and the absorbance of the solutions was measured again.
The crystalline structures of the supported samples were determined with a D8-A25 Discover with a LynxEyeXE detector. Spectra of the supported samples were collected from 2θ angles of 20–80° under Cu Kα radiation with a Focusing Goebel mirror for grazing incidence diffraction. All XPS spectra were recorded on a SIA 100 CAMECA-Riber, using monochromatic Al Kα X-rays.
An UV-3600 Shimadzu spectrometer equipped with an integrating sphere was used to acquire UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectra of the semiconducting materials in a range of 300–650 nm, and an UV-2550 Shimadzu spectrometer was used to collect the absorbance spectra of the MB aqueous solution in a range of 600–700 nm. TG-DSC analyses were performed with the use of a SENSYS evo TG-DSC, Setaram Instruments (France). Ramping of temperature was set at 5 °C min−1.
In order to perform photocatalytic tests, an originally designed light emitting diode irradiation device was assembled (see scheme in Fig. 1). The core of the device relies on a high-power single color emitter (400 nm) with a narrow relative spectral power distribution. LEDs were provided by LED Engin (USA). ITO-supported samples were vertically fixed on the rear wall of the quartz cuvette at a distance of 2 cm from the light source. The optical light irradiance of the LEDs was measured with the use of an IL1700 International Light (USA) radiometer. The light radiation intensity for the 400 nm LED was approx. 140 mW cm−2. The LED illumination device allowed us to maintain a constant temperature of 24.6 °C in aqueous solutions in the cuvette at a distance of 1 cm from the emitters (see Fig. S1 ESI†).

For photoelectrochemical studies, a system of 3 electrodes was assembled, where the reference electrode was Ag/AgCl/Cl− (3 M KCl), the counter electrode was Pt wire, while the working electrodes were a Pt flat sheet or ITO of a geometrical surface area of about 1.2 cm2. It should be noted however, that the real surface area of the ITO electrodes with deposited metal oxides (ITO/ZnO and ITO/ZnO/TiO2) was much higher than that of the Pt electrode because of their nanostructured texture. The photoelectrochemical measurements were carried out on an AUTOLAB PGSTAT 30 Eco Chemie B.V (The Netherlands). The working electrode was illuminated with light of intensity 100 mW cm−2 by means of a 450 W arc xenon lamp (Oriel).
2.3. Preparation of ZnO nanorods
A general concept for the fabrication of ZnO nanorods on ITO based on a two-step procedure has been reported by us recently.47 In brief, the ITO plates, preliminarily cleaned by sequential immersion for 10 s in 3 M NaOH, deionized water and concentrated H2SO4, were electrochemically covered with a seed layer of Zn nanocrystals in the form of blocks and nanosheets. The seeding was performed at room temperature in an aqueous solution of 0.1 M Zn(CH3COO)2 in the presence of oxygen at a constant potential of −1.2 V vs. an Ag/AgCl/Cl− (3 M) reference electrode. As has been reported, the presence of oxygen in the solution induced partial coverage of the ITO electrodes with urchin-like Zn crystals, and such plates were chosen as they proved to have better photoelectrochemical response due to likely better electric contact between ZnO and Zn than ZnO and ITO.48 Then, the plates were annealed in air at 300 °C for 1 h in order to transform the superficial layer of Zn into ZnO. Afterward, on such seeded substrates the ZnO nanorods were grown in a hydrothermal process in aqueous solution of 0.04 M Zn(NO3)2 at pH 10.6, fixed by addition of ammonia solution. The growth took place in a Teflon-sealed autoclave placed in an oven for 2.5 h at 80 °C. After termination of the growth, the samples were washed with deionized water, dried in air and finally calcined at 300 °C.
2.4. Preparation of core–shell ZnO/TiO2 systems
In order to cover the ZnO nanorods with a thin layer of TiO2, a sol–gel method was used and developed. Firstly, the ITO/ZnO samples were placed upside-down in a vigorously stirred solution of titanium(IV) butoxide diluted in isopropanol in the volume ratio of 1:100. After 15 min of conditioning, a hydrolysis reaction was initiated by addition of water, injected in one stream within ca. 30 s into the solution of the titanium precursor in a molar ratio 4:1 (H2O:Ti(OC4H9)4). The formation process of TiO2 is based on the hydrolytic reaction of titanium(IV) butoxide followed by a condensation process49 according to the scheme: Ti(OC4H9)4 + 4H2O → Ti(OH)4 + 4C4H9OH (hydrolysis)(1) Ti(OH)4 → TiO2 × yH2O + (2 − y)H2O (condensation)(2)
It was found that the TiO2 nanoparticles were formed both on the ZnO nanorod surface and in the bulk of the solution. Moreover, placing the samples upside-down prevented the attachment of large particle clusters to the samples. Precipitation/deposition was carried out for 6 h and then the sample was taken out of the solution and washed by soaking in ethanol. For convenience, this procedure has been denoted the “one deposition cycle”, or for short “1 c-6 h”. The ZnO/TiO2 sample was also prepared according to a modified sol–gel procedure: the TiO2 deposition on ZnO was performed in three successive 30 min cycles (“3 c-30 min”). Since raw TiO2 obtained via a sol–gel method is amorphous and in this form has negligible photocatalytic properties,50 it is necessary to convert it to anatase by annealing.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Thermogravimetric-differential scanning calorimetry (TG-DSC) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies
Materials prepared by the sol–gel method are known to contain organic residues and the amorphous-to-anatase phase transformation temperature strongly depends on the size of the TiO2 nanoparticles51 and synthetic conditions. Therefore, we used TG-DSC in order to determine if these residues are completely eliminated after calcination at 450 °C, and if the chosen temperature promotes the phase transition of TiO2 prepared in our sol–gel approach.
First, pure TiO2 formed in the bulk of the solution during Ti(OC4H9)4 hydrolysis was characterized (Fig. 2a). Analysis of the weight changes (red curve) and corresponding thermal effects (black curve) allowed us to distinguish the following stages. The weight loss observed below 100 °C, accompanied by an endothermic broad peak, can be attributed to the dehydroxylation of the formed titanium (oxo)hydroxide. Further increase of the temperature to 200–300 °C results in an additional weight loss coinciding with a significant exothermic effect. This combination clearly indicates a burning out of the organic moieties occluded in the sample. The last process occurring at 400 °C results in a sharp heat release without any noticeable weight variation, which allows us to assign it to the crystallization of anatase.
 Fig. 2  Thermogravimetric (red curves) and DSC (black curves) results for TiO2 powder precipitated in the bulk of the deposition solution (a) and for the ZnO nanorods/TiO2 composite (b). The dotted lines in (b) correspond to the results obtained for bare ZnO nanorods. All measurements were performed under air atmosphere. 
The amount of TiO2 deposited on the ZnO nanorods in one 30 min run is insufficient for correct TGA-DSC measurements. Therefore, the reaction for the precipitation of TiO2 for each sample was repeated three times. Several identically prepared samples were combined together to obtain a material of sufficient weight (ca. 10 mg). The TGA-DSC profiles were also recorded for bare ZnO nanorods (Fig. 2b, dotted curves) and this sample was used as a reference for the ZnO/TiO2 system (Fig. 2b, solid lines). The results obtained for bare ZnO are in accordance with the general behavior of materials without phase transitions. The peaks for the ZnO/TiO2 sample are less intense and broader than those for pure TiO2 (Fig. 2a), but the same trends can be distinguished. Below 100 °C the weight loss is endothermic and thus it can be attributed to the dehydroxylation of the amorphous titanium hydroxide. At higher temperatures exothermic peaks are observed, which are due to organic residues burning out and the crystallization of the anatase phase. The broadening of the exothermic peaks in the case of ZnO/TiO2 can be explained by its specific preparation procedure. Indeed, three layers produced in different steps can have slightly different thermal behavior, stemming possibly from their varying arrangement relative to the ZnO nanorods. Such heterogeneity should naturally result in broader peaks than those seen for the non-supported solid prepared in a single step. The TGA-DSC data show that the calcination temperature used in our study (450 °C) is sufficient for burning out the organic residues. It also follows that at this temperature the deposited amorphous layer is transformed into anatase at a high rate, as suggested by the sharpness of the corresponding exothermic peak. This finding confirms that the chosen calcination time (1 h) allows the complete conversion of the amorphous titanium (oxo)hydroxide into a crystalline anatase.
XRD characterization of representative ITO/ZnO/TiO2 composites and TiO2 powder after annealing was performed to confirm a complete amorphous-to-anatase transformation upon calcination at 450 °C. The XRD patterns recorded for these materials are presented in Fig. 3 together with ZnO-zincite and TiO2-anatase reference patterns. The XRD pattern of the TiO2 powder calcined at 450 °C for 1 h fits with that of anatase-TiO2 (ICDD card no. 03-065-5714). The signals observed at 2θ angles of 25.3°, 37.8°, 48.0°, 54.0°, 55.1°, 62.5°, 68.7°, 70.2°, 75.1°, and 82.7° correspond respectively to the planes (101), (004), (200), (105), (211), (204), (116), (220), (215), (224). No other peaks were observed for the TiO2 powder, suggesting formation of one TiO2 structure. As for the XRD results of the ITO-supported samples, all recorded peaks are characteristic of the ZnO-zincite standard pattern (ICDD card no. 00-036-1451). Among the ZnO-matched signals in the samples, two are particularly noticeable, at 34.4° and 62.9°, suggesting strong preferential orientation of the ZnO nanorods along the crystallographic directions [002] and [103], respectively.
 Fig. 3  XRD patterns of: TiO2 powder obtained in the bulk of the solution by the sol–gel method and calcined at 450 °C (red); the ITO/ZnO sample calcined at 300 °C (orange); the 1 c-6 h ITO/ZnO/TiO2 sample calcined at 450 °C (black); and the 3 c-30 min ITO/ZnO/TiO2 sample (grey). The blue pattern corresponds to the reference TiO2-anatase, and the green to ZnO-zincite. Inset in the right top corner depicts the peak position of the anatase-TiO2 (101) plane found in a 3 c-30 min sample. 
Due to the strong alignment of the ZnO nanorods and the very small amount of deposited TiO2, the XRD patterns of the ZnO/TiO2 sample are mostly dominated by these two ZnO signals. Nevertheless, the most intense TiO2 peak (101) can be still distinguished in the 3 c-30 min XRD pattern, in which the TiO2 deposited amount was expected to be the highest. The XRD along with the TG-DSC thus confirmed the presence of TiO2-anatase after calcination at 450 °C.
3.2. Scanning and transmission electron microscopy (SEM and TEM) studies and development of the deposition procedure
The length of ZnO nanorods obtained by the use of the hydrothermal method was in the range 1.6–2.2 μm, whereas the diameter varied from 100–300 nm at the bottom of nanorods. In accordance with our previous experience, the obelisk-like hexagonal ZnO nanorods with smooth sides (see inset in Fig. 4A) grown on the sheet-like Zn/ZnO seeds were arranged in a uniform layer (Fig. 4B), whereas those grown on the Zn/ZnO blocks formed urchin-like structures, as illustrated in Fig. 4C.
 Fig. 4  SEM images of ZnO nanorods obtained by the hydrothermal method: top view over a large surface area (A) with a high-resolution micrograph of the tip of a single ZnO nanorod (inset), and cross-sectional views (B and C) seen in lower secondary and low-angle backscattered electron projection. 
The SEM images of the ZnO nanorods after 1 c-6 h TiO2 deposition by the sol–gel method are presented in Fig. 5A. The image over a large surface area (at low magnification) was not different from that collected before deposition. However, from comparison of the pictures taken at higher magnification it is evident that after the sol–gel synthesis the surfaces of the ZnO nanorods were covered with a layer of deposited material. It is important that the nanorods are still separated from each other and no deposited material was accumulated in the form of powder between the nanorods.
 Fig. 5  SEM (A) and TEM (B) images of 1 c-6 h ZnO/TiO2 composite nanorods. 
The layer formed on the ZnO nanorods consisted of hydrated amorphous titanium dioxide in the form of titanium hydroxides, TiO(OH)2 or Ti(OH)4. After calcination of the samples at 450 °C for 1 h the surface of the nanorods became rough due to shrinking of the deposited material, an effect of the removal of water. These rough TiO2 layers are clearly visible in the TEM images presented in Fig. 5B. The coating thickness after calcination varied significantly, depending on the place on the surface. It is also worth noting that the TiO2 layer is composed of nanoparticles of various shape and size (diameter in the range 3–8 nm).
An attempt at improving the quality and thickness of the TiO2 shell formed on the ZnO nanorods consisted of an increase of the number of deposition cycles, while the deposition time was shortened to 30 min. Therefore, in the next experiment TiO2 was deposited on ZnO in three successive 30 min deposition cycles with calcination of the sample at 450 °C for 1 h after each cycle. This procedure will be denoted further in the text as the “3 c-30 min” procedure to distinguish from the one discussed above. The SEM pictures presented in Fig. 6 indicate that the ZnO nanorods after 3 deposition cycles are covered with a surprisingly uniform, continuous and smooth film. The tips of the nanorods are rounded and oval. Application of a low-angle backscattered electron detector (LABE) allowed us to distinguish the inner ZnO core (less transparent, brighter contrast) from the surface TiO2 shell (more transparent, darker contrast) due to the difference in the atomic numbers of Zn and Ti (see Fig. 6B).
 Fig. 6  SEM images of 3 c-30 min ZnO/TiO2 sample. Single nanorods observed at higher magnification using typical backscattering electron detection (inset A), and low-angle backscattering electron detection – LABE (inset B). The blue line suggests the boundary between ZnO and TiO2. 
A more detailed study of the 3 c-30 min sample morphology was performed by TEM. The micrographs presented in Fig. 7 clearly indicate that the 3-cycle procedure led to the formation of a continuous TiO2 layer of average thickness 25–40 nm. Although the layer is composed of 3 thinner layers formed in separate deposition cycles, one cannot distinguish the frontiers between them. This means that the nanoparticles formed in subsequent deposition cycles filled the gaps formed by the calcination of the previous layer. According to thermodynamic considerations, new particles have a tendency to occupy hole-type spaces in order to lower the total surface energy, thus enhancing the stability of the whole system. This fact seems to be advantageous for future anticorrosion applications and for better understanding of the behaviour of such systems. It is also interesting to note that at high magnification the boundary between ZnO and TiO2 is not very smooth, and some brighter pits are located in the ZnO nanorods. These empty spaces could be formed according to a mechanism analogous to void formation in the Kirkendall effect,52 consisting of partial atomic diffusion during annealing. According to this concept the formation of voids may be explained by outward transport of fast-moving cations through the oxide layer and a balancing inward flow of vacancies to the vicinity of the metal–oxide interface.
 Fig. 7  TEM images of 3 c-30 min ZnO/TiO2 systems. 
This phenomenon has not been observed for ZnO and TiO2 under low-temperature conditions. However, due to the high reactivity of the as-prepared layer consisting of Ti(OH)4, the process may proceed contrarily to the formation of the more stable anatase-TiO2 phase.53,54 The mass of the ZnO nanostructures, measured with a sensitive microbalance, was 1.15 mg per 1 cm2 of seeded ITO substrate. The results of EDX analysis (Ti:Zn ratio) (see Fig. S2 ESI†) allow us to estimate that the amount of TiO2 deposited on the ZnO nanorods in 1 c-6 h was about 0.11 mg per 1 cm2, while for 3 c-30 min it was almost 3 times higher, 0.28 mg cm−2. The spectroscopic results (see Fig. S3 ESI†) showed that the decrease of MB concentration in the solutions due to adsorption onto ZnO/TiO2 was greater for the 1 c-6 h sample than for the 3 c-30 min one, whereas ZnO showed negligible adsorption, probably because of the non-polar side facets of the nanorods. The amount of MB adsorbed on the ZnO/TiO2, estimated from the UV-Vis spectra, is 9 × 10−8 mol per 1 mg of TiO2 for 1 c-6 h sample, and 3.5 times lower (2.6 × 10−8 mol per 1 mg of TiO2) for the 3 c-30 min sample. These results clearly demonstrate that the TiO2 layer obtained in the 1 c-6 h synthesis has a more developed surface than that formed from the 3 c-30 min procedure, which is consistent with the TEM images presented above. Also, as is generally postulated, the stronger adsorption may promote higher photocatalytic activity at the photocatalyst surface.
3.3. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)
The surface chemical composition of the ZnO nanorods and ZnO/TiO2 core–shell system was determined by analysis of the Ti 2p, Zn 2p and O 1s peaks in the XPS spectra presented in Fig. 8. The positions of the peaks of Zn 2p1/2 and 2p3/2 at 1021.4 eV and 1044 eV in the spectrum of the ZnO nanorods are typical of Zn in an oxygen surrounding.55,56 The same conclusion can be drawn for the Ti atoms, as the Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2 peaks observed respectively at 458.5 eV and 464 eV are characteristic of Ti–O binding energies in TiO2 nanoparticles.57,58 The O 1s peak in the bare and TiO2-covered ZnO nanorods has a complex structure with a pronounced shoulder (Fig. 8). The position of the main component (530.2 eV) is typical for the oxygen atoms in oxides.59,60 The shoulder, with a maximum at 532.8 eV, can be attributed to the surface OH groups.61 The OH groups detected on the surface of both samples after calcination (300 °C for bare ZnO nanorods or 450 °C for ZnO/TiO2) cannot be due to incomplete dehydroxylation, since according to TGA-DSC this is completed below 200 °C. The appearance of OH can thus be explained by dissociative water adsorption on the surface of the samples during their exposure to the ambient air before acquisition of the XPS spectra.62
 Fig. 8  XPS spectra of ITO/ZnO (top row), 1 c-6 h ITO/ZnO/TiO2 (middle row) and 3 c-30 min ITO/ZnO/TiO2 (bottom row). 
The results of the quantitative analysis of Ti and Zn in different samples are presented in Table 1 along with the EDX results obtained in SEM. It follows from the EDX results that prolongation of the reaction time or increasing the number of cycles allows deposition of a higher amount of TiO2. In this context the 3-cycle procedure seems to be the most efficient. By extending the reaction time from 30 min to 6 h within one cycle, the Ti:Zn ratio only increased from 0.06 to 0.1, while using 3 cycles of deposition resulted in an almost fivefold increase of the Ti:Zn ratio (from 0.06 to 0.27). The XPS, which gives information about the surface Ti:Zn ratio, allows us to estimate the efficiency of the coverage of ZnO with the TiO2 layer. Table 1 shows that the trend is similar to that observed for the overall amount of TiO2. In this regard, longer times or multiplying the number of cycles results in a considerable increase in Ti:Zn ratio in the surface layer. Once more, the 3-cycle procedure turns out to be more efficient since it allows us to obtain an order of magnitude increase of the ratio from 0.17 to 2.

Comparison of the XPS results with the TEM observations allows us to obtain additional information about the textural properties of the TiO2 layer. It is well known that the surface layer analysed by XPS in inorganic materials is several nanometers in thickness. Using the QUASES-IMFP-TPP2M (software available at http://www.quases.com/products/quases-imfp-tpp2m/) we estimated that for the flat ZnO surface covered with a continuous layer of crystalline anatase, Zn atoms should not be seen in the XPS if the thickness of the TiO2 layer exceeds 4 nm (Fig. S4 ESI†). The thickness of the shell formed in the 3 c-30 min sample (ca. 40 nm, see Fig. 7) is much larger than this limit, however. Assuming that this shell is continuous, the presence of a Zn signal in the XPS spectrum can be explained only if one admits that the TiO2 layer is porous. In this case the effective density of the layer will be much lower than that of crystalline anatase, and the photoelectrons emitted by the Zn atoms will be able to reach the external surface of the particles. The presence of an intense signal for Zn in the XPS spectra of ZnO/TiO2 is thus a clear indication that the produced anatase shell is porous.
3.4. Optical properties of ZnO/TiO2 composite materials
To evaluate the optical properties of the ZnO/TiO2 composites, the UV-Vis absorbance spectra (obtained from diffuse reflectance) of the 3 c-30 min and 1 c-6 h samples are compared in Fig. 9 with the results obtained for bare ZnO nanorods and the TiO2 powder fabricated via the sol–gel method. As can be seen, the absorption edges for the single oxides are at about 400 nm for ZnO and even lower, ca. 390 nm, for TiO2. In contrast, the composite ZnO/TiO2 samples demonstrate noticeably red-shifted absorption onsets at ∼450 nm. The spectra for ZnO/TiO2 also reveal a pronounced low-energy absorption tail (Urbach tail) exponentially increasing from about 550 nm, which may be a result of the appearance of new interface energy states in forbidden band gaps. Since these new interface levels can be localized closely to conduction bands, excitation to them may be probable.19
 Fig. 9  Absorbance spectra (obtained from diffuse reflectance) of 3 c-30 min (blue curve, 1) and 1 c-6 h (red curve, 2) ZnO/TiO2 systems; the orange curve (3) corresponds to the ITO/ZnO sample, whereas the black curve (4) corresponds to the spectrum of TiO2 powder obtained by the sol–gel method and calcined at 450 °C. The inset shows the plots of (αhν)1/n as a function of photon energy (hν) for direct (n = ½) and indirect (n = 2) transitions in semiconductors. The (αhν)1/n plots were calculated from absorbance spectra for the ITO/ZnO/TiO2 composite systems. 
The UV-Vis spectra were used to determine the optical band gap energy, Eg, by means of the Tauc equation:63 αhν = A(hν − Eg)1/n,(3)where hν is the photon energy, A is the frequency-independent constant, and the exponent n depends on the nature of the transition in the semiconductor, i.e., n = ½ for allowed direct and n = 2 for allowed indirect transitions. Despite of some controversy, it has been found that ZnO is an n-type direct band gap semiconductor,64 while anatase-TiO2 is a material of indirect transition.65–67 Optical band gap energies were obtained from the plot of (αhν)1/nvs. (hν), from the intersection of the tangent line with the horizontal axis (inset in Fig. 9). Since the TiO2 is an external layer, it was assumed in the calculations and plotting that the exponent in the component materials is n = 2. However, concerning the morphology and thickness of the TiO2 layers, one should compare both extremes (n = ½, n = 2), as has been reasonably presented elsewhere for ZnFe2O4/TiO2 composite systems.68 As depicted in the inset in Fig. 9, the lowest value of optical energy band gap was found for the 3 c-30 min ZnO/TiO2 composite (∼2.78 eV) and a value a little higher (∼2.86 eV) was obtained for the 1 c-6 h ZnO/TiO2 (Table 1). And yet, in both cases, each system showed a lower optical energy band gap than any particular separate bare material (ZnO (nanorods): 3.05 eV and TiO2 (powder): 2.95 eV, see Fig. S5 ESI†). At this point it is also worth noting that zinc titanates of various Ti:Zn atomic ratios have their absorption edges deep in the UV range (<400 nm), and their optical energy band gap values varied from 3.32 to 3.70 eV.69,70 Thus, the optical behaviour of the ZnO/TiO2 systems can be ascribed to the appearance at the ZnO/TiO2 interface of new states whose energy levels are localized within the band gap. While the formation of such states was previously postulated in ZnO/TiO2 systems,9,25 their physical nature has not been elucidated up to date. We speculate that these states are related to cationic or anionic vacancies in ZnO. In our case the high concentration of the vacancies is evidenced by the formation of voids (see Fig. 7) that are in fact clusters of such vacancies.71 The energy levels corresponding to the vacancies in ZnO are localized within the band gap,72 giving rise to sub-band gap optical transitions in the visible range. Also in such energy states the electrons' lifetime can be effectively prolonged, hindering the recombination.73,74 It would therefore be interesting to characterize the influence of these new interface energy states on photocatalytic efficiency, and to confirm that the monochromatic irradiation (400 nm) chosen in accordance with the UV-Vis spectra (Fig. 9) could be used in the LED illumination device for photocatalytic tests.
3.5. Photocatalytic tests
In order to evaluate the photocatalytic performance of the systems studied, the photodegradation of a model dye (methylene blue) was investigated according to the International Standard procedure.75 By choosing monochromatic LEDs and an appropriate light intensity, one can reduce possible photosensitization of MB. Thus, the photodegradation of MB can be ascribed mainly to the presence of semiconductor materials and negligibly to the MB-photosensitized degradation mechanism itself.76 The mechanism of MB photodegradation by semiconductor materials in aqueous solutions can be explained by the formation of oxidizing agents. In short, upon illumination of the photoactive material the photogenerated electrons are initially transferred to O2 to form O2˙− radicals. On the other hand, the holes participate in the formation of another radical species, ˙OH from H2O and/or OH−. Both radicals (O2˙−, ˙OH) can afterwards induce a chain reaction, leading to the oxidation of organic compounds.77,78 However, because of the rather small difference between the reduction potential of oxygen to the superoxide radical (O2˙−) (−0.284 V vs. NHE)11 and the potentials of the lower edges of the conduction bands of TiO2 (about −0.5 V vs. NHE at pH = 7)11,79 and ZnO (about −0.63 V vs. NHE),80 the reducing power of the conduction band electrons of these semiconductors is rather low, and decolorization of MB more likely occurs via oxidation by holes from the valence band (VB).
The decolorization rate of the aqueous MB solution (2.5 ml) of concentration 10 μM under illumination with the LED of wavelength 400 nm was determined from the decrease in absorbance maximum intensity in the UV-Vis spectrum of the solution at the wavelength of 664 nm. In order to avoid a decrease in MB concentration in the test solution due to adsorption of the dye on TiO2, all samples used for photocatalytic measurements were held for 24 h in the 20 μM solution of MB prior to the measurements. Together with the results obtained for the illuminated samples, the data for “dark” samples were collected as a reference. It is assumed that the decomposition of MB on TiO2 obeys a first-order rate equation: (4)
Thus, the kinetic data obtained under illumination were analyzed by plotting the logarithm of concentration ratio as a function of time (Fig. 10), and an apparent first order rate constant (k400) was determined from the slope of this linear plot.
 Fig. 10  Photodegradation of the MB solution on ITO/ZnO (), 1 c-6 h () and 3 c-30 min () samples under irradiation of 400 nm light, and after addition of methanol (3% v/v) to the MB solution – ITO/ZnO (), 1 c-6 h () and 3 c-30 min (). The reference tests carried out in dark conditions – ITO/ZnO (), 1 c-6 h () and 3 c-30 min (). 
According to the band gap values listed in Table 1, the photon energy corresponding to the 400 nm wavelength (3.1 eV) is high enough to excite the electrons from the valence to the conduction band of the ZnO nanorod and ZnO/TiO2 systems. However, photocatalytic experiments have shown that the performance of the ZnO/TiO2 systems is better than that of bare ZnO nanorods (Fig. 10, full squares). Moreover, the rate constant obtained for the 1 c-6 h sample (k400 = 1.2 × 10−2 min−1) is almost 2-fold higher than that of the 3 c-30 min sample (k400 = 0.7 × 10−2 min−1), and 6-fold higher than that of bare ITO/ZnO (k400 = 0.2 × 10−2 min−1). A small value of the rate constant for ZnO is in accordance with the very low absorbance at 400 nm observed in the UV-Vis spectrum of ITO/ZnO (Fig. 9). The increase of absorbance in the visible range after deposition of TiO2 on ZnO may be a result of the appearance of new interface energy levels, as was discussed in the previous section. On the other hand, according to the literature, the lower edge of the conduction band (CB) of ZnO lies a little above that of TiO2, and therefore the photogenerated electrons are transferred from the CB of ZnO to the CB of TiO2, whereas the holes are transferred from the VB of TiO2 to the VB of ZnO. Thus, the formation of the ZnO/TiO2 interface may lead not only to lowering of the excitation energy, but also to better separation of the charge carriers, preventing fast charge carrier recombination.
In order to prove the significance of the hole-dependent degradation mechanism rather than that via photoexcited electrons, similar catalytic tests were performed with the addition of methanol, known to be an efficient scavenger of photogenerated holes.81,82 The results showed that the photocatalytic activities of all the samples decreased substantially (Fig. 10, full diamonds). The most notable drop in the rate constant value by a factor 4 (from 1.2 × 10−2 min−1 without methanol to 0.30 × 10−2 min−1 in the presence of methanol) was recorded for the 1 c-6 h sample. The rate constants of the process performed on the two other samples decreased, namely to kMetOH = 0.36 × 10−2 min−1 for the 3 c-30 min system and to kMetOH = 0.08 × 10−2 min−1 for the ITO/ZnO sample. These results support our assumption that the MB degradation mechanism is associated mainly with the photogenerated holes and the formation of ˙OH radicals, rather than with the photoexcited electrons and O2˙−.
Since the ZnO/TiO2 composites (1 c-6 h and 3 c-30 min) have very similar optical behaviour, one could expect similar photoactivities, but this is not the case. As was presented in the SEM micrographs (Fig. 5 and 7) the TiO2 layers in the two composite samples differ significantly in morphology. The TiO2 layer in the 1 c-6 h sample is rugged, while that in the 3 c-30 min sample is compact. Therefore, the interface between ZnO and TiO2 in 1 c-6 h is more easily accessible for reacting species (H2O, O2 and MB) in comparison to that in 3 c-30 min. Higher activity of the 1 c-6 h sample thus confirms the key role of the ZnO/TiO2 interface in photocatalysis.
3.6. Photoelectrochemical tests
Charge separation after the photogeneration of electron–hole pairs is one of the requisites for photoinduced redox reactions by semiconducting materials.83 This may be achieved due to the formation of a depletion layer at the semiconductor/solution interface as well as by application of the external bias potential. Therefore, in order to gain an insight into the electrochemical behavior of the materials studied, ZnO nanorods and the ZnO/TiO2 systems deposited on ITO were tested by means of cyclic voltammetry in a solution of 0.1 M LiClO4 containing ferrocene (Fc) as a redox probe. A non-aqueous solution was chosen to minimize the problems of dissolution of ZnO and TiO2 and adsorption of impurities that may occur in aqueous solutions.84,85 The measurements were performed in the dark and under illumination.
The cyclic voltammograms obtained in all systems studied are typical of n-type semiconductors in redox electrolyte.86,87 Namely, the dark oxidation currents at E > 0 V vs. Ag/AgCl are very small because of the very low population of the minority carriers (holes) at the semiconductor/solution interface. On the other hand, the reduction process with participation of the majority charge carriers (electrons) can proceed, and cathodic current is dependent on the potential and concentration of electroactive species at the electrode. As visible in Fig. 11, the cathodic and anodic dark currents on ITO/ZnO/TiO2 electrodes are noticeably higher than those obtained for bare ITO/ZnO. This may be ascribed to expansion of the electrode/solution interfacial area after deposition of TiO2. The slightly higher current density recorded for the 1 c-6 h than for the 3 c-30 min ZnO/TiO2 system (cf. lines 1 in Fig. 11b and c) may be explained by the more developed surface of the TiO2, as is illustrated in the TEM images in Fig. 5 and 7. Upon illumination of the electrode, the created electron–hole pairs are separated under the electric field. The holes are transferred towards the electrode surface and are involved in oxidation of ferrocene to the ferrocenium cation, leading to the increase in the height of the oxidation wave. This process is energetically possible because the redox potential of the Fc/Fc+ redox couple (0.36 V vs. Ag/AgCl), determined from mean potential between oxidation and reduction peaks in the cyclic voltammogram obtained on the Pt electrode (see curve 4 in Fig. 11a), is located within the band gap of TiO2 and ZnO, relatively close to the lower edge of the conduction band of TiO2. The latter value for TiO2 in acetonitrile solution is located at about 0 V vs. Ag/AgCl (on the electrochemical scale), as estimated from the onset of oxidation current.88,89
 Fig. 11  Comparison of the cyclic voltammograms obtained for ITO/ZnO (a), 3 c-30 min ITO/ZnO/TiO2 (b) and 1 c-6 h ITO/ZnO/TiO2 (c) in the dark (curves 1), under illumination with a xenon lamp with a ≤400 nm cut on filter (curves 2), and without a filter (curves 3), in a solution of 1 mM Fc in 0.1 M LiClO4/AN. Curve 4 in plot (a) is the cyclic voltammogram obtained in the same solution on a small Pt disc electrode. The inset in (c) shows the dependences of the cathodic peak currents ( – dark,  – photo) and anodic currents ( – dark,  – photo) at a potential of 1 V on the root of the scan rate for the 1 c-6 h sample. 
A comparison of the plots obtained for the three systems studied shows that the oxidation current density is practically the same for the 1 c-6 h and 3 c-30 min ZnO/TiO2 electrodes, and these values are two times higher than that for bare ZnO. This difference may be ascribed to the larger surface area of TiO2 with respect to ZnO and/or formation of the interface states at the ZnO/TiO2 boundary (see Section 3.5), which may be involved in the charge transfer from the metal oxide to ferrocene. On the other hand, the presence of these surface states may also result in a sub-band gap transition, leading to photoelectrochemical activity of the system in the visible range, which was confirmed after application of an UV filter cutting on the wavelengths below 400 nm (curves 2 in Fig. 11). The photoelectrochemical results obtained in the anodic potential range are in conformity with photocatalytic data. The higher value of the photocurrents is a result of the higher oxidation efficiency and in consequence higher photocatalytic activity of holes. It is also worth noting that in all cases the current density of the oxidation wave was practically independent of the scan rate (see inset in Fig. 11c), probably due to the relatively slow charge transfer process of oxidation of Fc at the electrode/solution interface.
In contrast, in the range of negative potentials, the reduction peak is well developed and its location is dependent on the system studied, i.e. −0.1 V in the case of ZnO and ZnO/TiO2 (1 c-6 h) and more negative than −0.2 V for the ZnO/TiO2 (3 c-30 min) electrode. This is probably a consequence of the different resistances of the systems. One may expect that the relatively compact layer of TiO2 in the 3 c-30 min sample may be a source of an additional ohmic drop at the electrode/solution interface in comparison to the 1 c-6 h ZnO/TiO2 electrode. It is also important to know that the intensity of the cathodic peak current is linearly dependent on the root of the scan rate, as for a diffusion controlled process. This means that the reaction of ferrocenium ion reduction by photoexcited electrons is relatively fast.
To conclude, the photoelectrochemical tests showed that the deposition of TiO2 thin layers on ZnO-nanostructured electrodes results in higher photocurrent densities than those obtained on bare ZnO in anodic and cathodic potential ranges, and the photocurrent responses depend on the TiO2 layer morphology.
4. Conclusions
In summary, hybrid composite ZnO/TiO2 systems were prepared by deposition of TiO2 onto ZnO nanorods, hydrothermally grown on an ITO surface, via a simple sol–gel method. The synthesis parameters, such as deposition time or repetition of single sol–gel cycle, allowed us to prepare either rugged TiO2 layers or compact and continuous TiO2 coatings. The rugged TiO2 layers were obtained after 6 hours of one step sol–gel synthesis followed by calcination of the sample (1 c-6 h), whereas a uniform coating of thickness 25–40 nm was formed after three successive synthesis (cycles) with calcination of the sample after each cycle (3 c-30 min sample) (Fig. 12). It was found that a complete amorphous-to-anatase phase transition of TiO2 nanoparticles deposited on ZnO occurred slightly below 450 °C, and organic residues were burnt out entirely, as indicated by the TG-DSC results. The presence of TiO2 anatase in the samples calcined at 450 °C was confirmed by XRD.
 Fig. 12  A summarizing scheme describing the preparation of TiO2 thin layers on ZnO nanorods by two main approaches – 1 c-6 h (Approach 1) and 3 c-30 min (Approach 2). 
The amount of TiO2 deposited on the ZnO nanorods may be increased either by an increase in deposition time in the single sol–gel cycle or by the application of three successive 30 min deposition cycles. Both the ZnO/TiO2 composite systems showed a substantial decrease in the optical band gap energy regardless of the assumed type of transition (direct or indirect) in comparison with the values for bare ZnO and TiO2 materials. A stronger effect was found for the 3 c-30 min samples, in which the contact between the ZnO and TiO2 components was continuous.
The importance of such an interface in relation to the optical properties was confirmed with photocatalytic and photoelectrochemical tests. The highest decomposition rate of MB in aqueous solution was achieved with the 1 c-6 h ZnO/TiO2 system, showing a 6-fold increase of photocatalytic activity in comparison with ITO/ZnO under irradiation with 400 nm light. The photocatalytic results also proved that the overall photocatalytic performance strongly depends on the morphology of the TiO2 layers, or more precisely, on the accessibility of the solution species to the ZnO/TiO2 interface.
Photoelectrochemical studies in the presence of ferrocene showed that higher current densities were observed for the ITO/ZnO/TiO2 composite electrodes than for the ITO/ZnO sample over a broad potential range. These results confirm and emphasize the significance of the TiO2 layer morphology on the photoelectrochemical properties of ZnO/TiO2 core–shell systems.
Thus, it was shown that depending on the morphology of the external TiO2 layer controlled by sol–gel deposition conditions, one can obtain core–shell ZnO/TiO2 systems suitable for photocatalytic and photoelectrochemical applications.

 	Fig. 1  A scheme depicting the photocatalytic irradiation device based on high-power UV-Vis light emitting diodes designed by the authors.	 
Ti(OC4H9)4 + 4H2O → Ti(OH)4 + 4C4H9OH (hydrolysis)	(1)
Ti(OH)4 → TiO2 × yH2O + (2 − y)H2O (condensation)	(2)

 	Fig. 2  Thermogravimetric (red curves) and DSC (black curves) results for TiO2 powder precipitated in the bulk of the deposition solution (a) and for the ZnO nanorods/TiO2 composite (b). The dotted lines in (b) correspond to the results obtained for bare ZnO nanorods. All measurements were performed under air atmosphere.	 

 	Fig. 3  XRD patterns of: TiO2 powder obtained in the bulk of the solution by the sol–gel method and calcined at 450 °C (red); the ITO/ZnO sample calcined at 300 °C (orange); the 1 c-6 h ITO/ZnO/TiO2 sample calcined at 450 °C (black); and the 3 c-30 min ITO/ZnO/TiO2 sample (grey). The blue pattern corresponds to the reference TiO2-anatase, and the green to ZnO-zincite. Inset in the right top corner depicts the peak position of the anatase-TiO2 (101) plane found in a 3 c-30 min sample.	 

 	Fig. 4  SEM images of ZnO nanorods obtained by the hydrothermal method: top view over a large surface area (A) with a high-resolution micrograph of the tip of a single ZnO nanorod (inset), and cross-sectional views (B and C) seen in lower secondary and low-angle backscattered electron projection.	 

 	Fig. 5  SEM (A) and TEM (B) images of 1 c-6 h ZnO/TiO2 composite nanorods.	 

 	Fig. 6  SEM images of 3 c-30 min ZnO/TiO2 sample. Single nanorods observed at higher magnification using typical backscattering electron detection (inset A), and low-angle backscattering electron detection – LABE (inset B). The blue line suggests the boundary between ZnO and TiO2.	 

 	Fig. 7  TEM images of 3 c-30 min ZnO/TiO2 systems.	 

 	Fig. 8  XPS spectra of ITO/ZnO (top row), 1 c-6 h ITO/ZnO/TiO2 (middle row) and 3 c-30 min ITO/ZnO/TiO2 (bottom row).

 	Fig. 9  Absorbance spectra (obtained from diffuse reflectance) of 3 c-30 min (blue curve, 1) and 1 c-6 h (red curve, 2) ZnO/TiO2 systems; the orange curve (3) corresponds to the ITO/ZnO sample, whereas the black curve (4) corresponds to the spectrum of TiO2 powder obtained by the sol–gel method and calcined at 450 °C. The inset shows the plots of (αhν)1/n as a function of photon energy (hν) for direct (n = ½) and indirect (n = 2) transitions in semiconductors. The (αhν)1/n plots were calculated from absorbance spectra for the ITO/ZnO/TiO2 composite systems.	 
αhν = A(hν − Eg)1/n,	(3)

 	Fig. 10  Photodegradation of the MB solution on ITO/ZnO (), 1 c-6 h () and 3 c-30 min () samples under irradiation of 400 nm light, and after addition of methanol (3% v/v) to the MB solution – ITO/ZnO (), 1 c-6 h () and 3 c-30 min (). The reference tests carried out in dark conditions – ITO/ZnO (), 1 c-6 h () and 3 c-30 min ().	 

 	Fig. 11  Comparison of the cyclic voltammograms obtained for ITO/ZnO (a), 3 c-30 min ITO/ZnO/TiO2 (b) and 1 c-6 h ITO/ZnO/TiO2 (c) in the dark (curves 1), under illumination with a xenon lamp with a ≤400 nm cut on filter (curves 2), and without a filter (curves 3), in a solution of 1 mM Fc in 0.1 M LiClO4/AN. Curve 4 in plot (a) is the cyclic voltammogram obtained in the same solution on a small Pt disc electrode. The inset in (c) shows the dependences of the cathodic peak currents ( – dark,  – photo) and anodic currents ( – dark,  – photo) at a potential of 1 V on the root of the scan rate for the 1 c-6 h sample.	 

 	Fig. 12  A summarizing scheme describing the preparation of TiO2 thin layers on ZnO nanorods by two main approaches – 1 c-6 h (Approach 1) and 3 c-30 min (Approach 2).
