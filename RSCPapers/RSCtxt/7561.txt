    AbstractThe peridinin chlorophyll-a protein (PCP) is a water–soluble, trimeric light harvesting complex found in marine dinoflagellates that binds peridinin and Chl-a in an unusual stoichiometric ratio of 4:1. In this paper, the pathways of excited-state energy transfer and relaxation in PCP were identified by means of femtosecond visible-pump, mid-infrared probe spectroscopy. In addition, excited-state relaxation of peridinin dissolved in organic solvent (CHCl3 and MeOH) was investigated. For peridinin in solution, the transient IR signatures of the low-lying S1 and intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) states were similar, in line with a previous ultrafast IR study. In PCP, excitation of the optically allowed S2 state of peridinin results in ultrafast energy transfer to Chl-a, in competition with internal conversion to low-lying optically forbidden states of peridinin. After vibrational relaxation of the peridinin hot S1 state in 150 fs, two separate low-lying peridinin singlet excited states are distinguished, assigned to an ICT state and to a slowly transferring, vibrationally relaxed S1 state. These states exhibit different lactone bleaches, indicating that the ICT and S1 states localize on distinct peridinins. Energy transfer from the peridinin ICT state to Chl-a constitutes the dominant energy transfer channel and occurs with a time constant of 2 ps. The peridinin S1 state mainly decays to the ground state through internal conversion, in competition with slow energy transfer to Chl-a. The singlet excited state of Chl-a undergoes intersystem crossing (ISC) to the triplet state on the nanosecond timescale, followed by rapid triplet excitation energy transfer (TEET) from Chl-a to peridinin, whereby no Chl-a triplet is observed but rather a direct rise of the peridinin triplet. The latter contains some Chl-a features due to excitonic coupling of the pigments. The peridinin triplet state shows a lactone bleach mode at 1748 cm−1, while that of the peridinin ICT state is located at 1745 cm−1, indicating that the main channels of singlet and triplet energy transfer in PCP proceed through distinct peridinins. Our results are consistent with an energy transfer scheme where the ICT state mainly localizes on Per621/611 and Per623/613, the S1 state on Per622/612 and the triplet state on Per624/614.
Introduction
Photosynthesis is the main process that supports life on Earth. It converts the most abundant energy source on the planet, solar energy, into chemical energy, which is used by nearly all organisms. The pigment-protein complexes that constitute the photosynthetic apparatus are highly evolved reflecting the biodiversity of the hosting organisms and the requirements imposed by the environment. The pigment-protein complexes that function to harvest sunlight are called light harvesting antennas. The light harvesting pigments differ among organisms; in the majority of the complexes, (bacterio)chlorophylls ((B)Chl) and carotenoids constitute the main chromophores. How the (B)Chls harvest light is reasonably well-understood;1,2 however, many questions remain on the role of carotenoids in LH complexes and their interaction with the (B)Chls. These questions arise from the complex excited state levels and the different functions assumed by carotenoids in the many natural light harvesting antennas3–6
Oceanic photosynthetic organisms contribute largely to the global CO2 fixation,7 and their LH apparatus has evolved to absorb light at higher frequencies compared with land-based photosynthetic organisms. The shift in the light absorption towards the blue spectral region counters increased absorption by water of red light compared to blue. Consequently such aquatic organisms are illuminated by light that has a relatively high intensity in the blue and the green, and the pigments in their LH complexes must absorb at higher frequencies. Red algae, cryptophytes and cyanobacteria developed light harvesting complexes with open-chain tetrapyrrole pigments,8 but in many eukaryotic marine algae, carotenoids play the role of major light harvesting pigments9

Amphidinium carterae is an interesting oceanic photosynthetic alga which is typical of the dinoflagellate group utilising peridinin as its principal light harvesting carotenoid. A large part of the peridinin is found in the water–soluble peridinin–chlorophyll–protein (PCP), a trimeric light harvesting antenna that binds peridinin and Chl-a in an unusual stoichiometric ratio of 4:1. PCP harvests sunlight and transfers energy to the photosystem II (PSII) reaction center (RC) core.10,11 The X-ray structure of PCP, shown in Fig. 1, revealed that each monomer is divided into two quasi-symmetric subunits containing one Chl-a closely surrounded by four peridinins.12 Generally, the EET efficiency from carotenoids to Chl can vary from <30% to almost 100%.6,13–15 Peridinin is an excellent light harvesting pigment which absorbs from 400 to 550 nm when bound to PCP with a maximum absorption in the green at ∼480 nm. PCP achieves a high efficiency of excitation energy transfer (EET) from peridinin to Chl-a of ∼90%. This remarkable efficiency results from tight packing of the pigments as well as an unusual excited state manifold of peridinin, which includes stabilization of an intramolecular charge-transfer (ICT) state.16–18 This chromophore organization is also responsible for a highly efficient Chl-a triplet quenching of 100%.16,19

The lactone ring, allene group and the two β rings are shown. See also Fig. SI.1 (ESI†). C: Molecular structure of Chlorophyll-a. The 9-keto and 10a-ester carbonyl groups are marked. 
Peridinin is a highly substituted caretenoid. It has an unusually short carbon skeleton (C37), and both an allene group and a lactone ring conjugated with the backbone (Fig. 1). At both ends of the conjugated carbon chain, β-rings are located, one with an epoxy group with a secondary alcohol group, and the other with an ester joining a tertiary alcohol group. After excitation of peridinin in solution, the relaxation pathway from the strongly absorbing 1Bu+ state (S2) depends on the polarity of the environment.20–24 In the nonpolar solvent hexane, S2 rapidly internally converts to the 2Ag− (S1) state, which has a 160 ps lifetime, as expected for a carotenoid with eight conjugated double bonds.20 However, in polar solvents (e.g. methanol and ethylene glycol), the excited state lifetime is ∼10 ps.20,22,24 It was suggested that this acceleration was due to the stabilization of a low-lying ICT state in polar solvent that is energetically lower than S121,23 and involves a structural rearrangement.23 Papagiannakis et al.22 resolved the excited state equilibrium between S1 and ICT state in solution demonstrating that they are distinct states. In addition, observation of a ground state intermediate (GSI) on the relaxation pathway sustains the hypothesis that population of the ICT state may stabilize a small-scale structural rearrangement of peridinin.
In PCP, peridinin employs multiple energy transfer channels to achieve a high efficiency of EET to Chl-a. Upon excitation of the peridinin to the S2 state, 25% of its energy flows to Chl-a directly.17,25 Peridinins in PCP are bound in a rather polar environment which favors population of the ICT state after excitation.25 The major channel of energy transfer in PCP is on the timescale of about 2 ps and involves the ICT states.16,17,25 Recently, non-linear polarization spectroscopy experiments on PCP confirmed that ICT is isoenergetic or slightly above Qy of Chl-a.26 The PCP complex therefore represents an example of a system where energy-transfer pathways and their efficiencies are finely tuned, not only by the protein structure ensuring a proper orientation of the donor and acceptor molecules, but also by the polarity and/or hydrogen-bonding capability of the environment, which adjusts the degree of charge-transfer character of the lowest excited state.
The vibrational spectrum of a protein or a protein-bound chromophore contains a wealth of information about its structure, its interaction with the environment and its electronic properties. Time-resolved IR spectroscopy is a powerful tool that can reveal many of the dynamic structural and physical–chemical properties of chromophores involved in (photo)biological reactions.27,28 It has revealed energy and electron transfer pathways in photosynthetic antennae and reaction centers29–34 and given detailed insight into reaction dynamics of biological photoreceptors.35–41
In this work, the excited-state energy transfer and relaxation pathways in PCP were studied using ultrafast visible-pump mid-IR probe spectroscopy. We determined the IR signature of the various peridinin and Chl-a molecular states involved in energy transfer processes, in particular those of the peridinin S1, ICT and triplet states. By comparing the frequencies of the peridinin lactone modes of these states, we assigned the involvement of particular peridinins to specific events in the light-harvesting process.
Materials and methods
Sample preparation
Samples of PCP from A. carterae were purified as described in ref. 12 and dissolved in D2O buffer (25 mM TRIS Cl, 2 mM KCl, 3 mM NaN3, pD = 7.5). Peridinin was isolated from A. carterae thylakoids by the method of Martison and Plumley42 and was purified using reverse phase HPLC using an Alltech C18 column. The samples were concentrated to OD480 = 0.6/20 μm (see Fig. SI.2, ESI†) and OD660 = 0.4/20 μm (for PCP) and OD530 = 0.4/5 μm (for peridinin in solution) placed in a sample cell formed by two CaF2 plates separated by a 20 μm (5 μm) Teflon spacer for a total volume of 40 μL (10 μL). To avoid photodamage during the measurements, the sample was continuously moved by a home-built Lissajous scanner.
Experimental setup
The experimental setup, described in detail previously30 consists of a Ti:sapphire amplified laser system (Hurricane, Spectra-Physics) providing a 800 nm source, with an output of 0.65 mJ, repetition rate at 1 kHz and duration of 85 fs. A portion of the 800 nm light was used to pump an optical parametric generator and amplifier with difference frequency generator (TOPAS, Light Conversion, Vilnius, Lithuania), producing a tunable output (2.5–10 μm) with a bandwidth of ∼200 cm−1. The probe pulse on the sample was attenuated to 1 nJ. A second portion of the 800 nm light was sent into a home-built non-collinear optical parametric amplifier (NOPA) to produce the pump pulse at 480 nm (660 nm) with a power of 75 nJ (150 nJ), which was used to excite the sample. The polarization between pump and probe pulses was set at the magic angle (54.7°) using a Berek rotator (Model 5540; New Focus, San Jose, CA). The probe pulse was collimated and focused on the entrance slit of a spectrograph and dispersed onto a 32-element mercury-cadmium-tellurium (MCT) detector array, yielding a spectral resolution of 6 cm−1. The instrument response function (IRF) of the system had a width of 150 fs (FWHM). Changes in the IR absorption were monitored in the carbonyl region from 1780 to 1650 cm−1 in a time range of six nanoseconds.
Data analysis
The time-resolved data can be described in terms of a parametric model in which some parameters, such as those descriptive of the instrument response function (IRF), are wavenumber-dependent, whereas others, such as the lifetime of a certain spectrally-distinct component, underlay the data at all wavenumbers. The presence of parameters that underlay the data at all wavenumbers allow the application of global analysis techniques,43 which model wavenumber-invariant parameters as a function of all data. The partitioned variable projection algorithm is well-suited to the optimization of model parameters for global analysis models.44 The algorithm has the further advantage of estimating the standard error of parameters, which is useful in model selection and validation. A compartmental model was used to describe the evolution of the spectrally distinct components in time. Global analysis was then applied to estimate the lifetime and relative concentration of each component at each wavenumber in the data.
The femtosecond transient absorption data were first globally analyzed using a kinetic model consisting of sequentially interconverting evolution-associated difference spectra (EADS), i.e. 1 → 2 → 3 →⋯ (Fig. 2, 3 and 5A) in which the arrows indicate successive mono-exponential decays of increasing time constant, which can be regarded as the lifetime of each EADS. The first EADS corresponds to the time-zero difference spectrum. This procedure enables us to clearly visualize the evolution of the (excited and intermediate) states of the system. In general, the EADS may well reflect mixtures of molecular states.
To disentangle the contributions of the various molecular species in the spectral evolution, we performed a target analysis of time-resolved data. Target analysis involves the application of a compartmental model (inset in Fig. 6) containing microscopic decay rates expressing intercompartmental transitions, and may be used to test detailed hypotheses regarding the underlying kinetics. The spectrum associated with each component in a target analysis applied to difference absorption data is termed species-associated difference spectrum (SADS, Fig. 6). In contrast to the EADS, the SADS will represent the spectral signature of the pure molecular species and their kinetics after photon absorption. In this way, energy transfer and relaxation pathways and mechanisms can be assessed in terms of discrete intermediate states.
Results
Peridinin in solution
The excited-state dynamics of peridinin in organic solvent were studied to aid the interpretation of peridinin dynamics in the PCP complex. Fig. 2A shows the EADS for peridinin in chloroform (CHCl3) upon excitation at 530 nm. Five components were required for a satisfactory fit of the time-resolved data, with lifetimes of 100 fs, 1.7 ps, 6.6 ps, 65 ps and a non-decaying component. The first EADS with a 100 fs lifetime (grey squares, dashed line) corresponds to the initially excited S2 state that internally converts to the optically forbidden S1 state. Note that this EADS may be affected by the perturbed free induction decay (FID) and therefore cannot be reliably interpreted. The following EADS with lifetimes of 1.7 ps, 6.6 ps and 65 ps represent the optically forbidden S1 state of peridinin. These EADS have very similar shapes with an overall broad, nonspecific induced absorption with a superimposed pattern of ground state bleach and induced absorptions. Due to the overall positive amplitude of the EADS it is difficult to identify the exact bleach/induced absorption frequencies. The IR difference spectra are similar to those reported previously for peridinin in solution,45 except that in the latter case, a slight spectral evolution was observed with relative amplitude changes of the bands. The 1.7 and 6.6 ps evolutions represent only minor spectral and amplitude changes and may be associated with vibrational cooling and solvation processes, possibly in combination with charge-transfer equilibration.22 The S1 signal decays to essentially zero in 65 ps, in line with the ultrafast IR study on peridinin reported by Van Tassle et al.45 and peridinin S1 lifetimes reported for nonpolar solvents.20

Fig. 2B shows the EADS for peridinin in MeOH. Three components were required for an adequate fit, with time constants of 100 fs, 1.8 ps and 10 ps. The overall spectral shape of the EADS is similar to those observed earlier for peridinin in d4-MeOH.45 Also, the EADS of peridinin in methanol and in chloroform (Fig. 2A) are not much different, implying that the mid-IR signatures of the optically forbidden peridinin S1 and ICT states are rather similar, confirming the findings by Van Tassle et al.45
Chlorophyll-a excitation of PCP: global analysis
PCP in D2O buffer was excited at 660 nm to determine the Chl-a dynamics upon direct excitation. A spectral window between 1770–1650 cm−1 was probed. Fig. 3 shows the result of a global analysis in terms of a sequential kinetic scheme (Fig. 3, inset) in the form of evolution-associated difference spectra (EADS). Kinetic traces at selected frequencies are shown in Fig. 4. Four components were required for an adequate description of the time-resolved data. For this excitation wavelength the spectra resulting from a sequential analysis are assigned to molecular species due to the sequential nature of the energy relaxation process, and may be regarded as species-associated difference spectra (SADS).

 Fig. 4  Kinetic traces at selected wavenumbers for PCP in D2O following excitation at 660 nm. The time axis is linear between 0 and 10 ps and logarithmic thereafter. 
The first component (Fig. 3, squares with dashed line) is formed within the instrument response (150 fs) and decays in 200 fs into the second component (Fig. 3, circles). The second component evolves in 45 ps into a third component (grey triangles), which decays in 3 ns to form a non-decaying species (Fig. 3, black triangles). The first EADS exhibits bands at 1699(−), 1687(−), 1670(+, shoulder) and 1658(+) cm−1, assigned to the 9-keto modes of the two Chl-a in the asymmetric subunit46 (Fig. 4, traces F, G, H, and I). The vibrational mode frequencies and their assignments are summarized in Table 1. In addition, it shows bands at 1736(−) and 1727(+) cm−1 assigned to 10a-ester carbonyl stretches of Chl-a. These assignments are in good agreement with earlier reports.29,30,47 Interestingly, The first EADS also contains a negative band at 1718 cm−1, which may be assigned to a CO lactone stretch of peridinin48 Thus, the first EADS exhibits explicit peridinin contributions which may be indicative of exciton coupling between Chl-a and peridinin. We note, however, that some caution should be taken when interpreting this EADS given that perturbed FID signals may contribute at such short timescales.49

The first EADS relaxes in 200 fs into the 2nd EADS. The 2nd EADS clearly shows the presence of two distinct 9-keto stretches at 1699(−)/1687(−)/1658(+) cm−1 and two distinct 10a-ester stretches at 1752(−)/1743(+) cm−1 (Fig. 4, trace A) and 1736(−)/1730(+) cm−1 (Fig. 4, trace C), assigned to the two Chl-a bound within the PCP monomer. Notably, the peridinin contribution (1718 cm−1) is much weaker. With the 200 fs evolution, an overall shift of the Chl-a ESA towards higher wavenumbers is observed: the 10a-ester ESA shifts from 1727 to 1730 cm−1 and the 9-keto ESA becomes sharper. These are fingerprints for vibrational cooling, so we identify the first EADS as Chl hotQy which relaxes in 200 fs to a vibrationally relaxed Chl Qy. Again, perturbed FID signals may contribute at such short timescales so caution should be taken. The second EADS decays in 45 ps in the third EADS and represents a relatively minor spectral evolution.
The third EADS has a lifetime of 3 ns, which is typical for the singlet excited state of Chl-a in PCP.19,25 The nondecaying EADS is difficult to estimate due to its low amplitude and the relatively poor signal-to-noise in the experiments. Nevertheless, the prominent negative feature at 1749 cm−1 and a broad ESA at 1724 (Fig. 4, trace D) may be assigned to a downshift of the peridinin CO lactone stretch vibration, as observed in the peridinin triplet state 3[Per].48 Thus, the peridinin lactone signal rising at long delay times (Fig. 4, trace B), assigned to the peridinin triplet state (3[Per]) is formed upon TEET from 3[Chl-a]. Note that the peridinin triplet state is rising faster than with the 17 ns time constant reported previously.16 A similar fast rise of the carotenoid triplet state, without an observable 3[Chl-a] intermediate was also observed in artificial LH complexes.50–52
Peridinin excitation of PCP at 480 nm: global analysis
PCP in D2O buffer was excited at 480 nm to determine the infrared signature of the peridinin to Chl-a energy transfer dynamics. The EADS that follow from a global analysis, using a sequential model are shown in Fig. 5. Six components were required to satisfactorily fit the data, with time constants of 60 fs, 150 fs, 2 ps, 11.5 ps, 1 ns and a non-decaying component. The time constants are similar to those found with ultrafast spectroscopy in the visible and near-IR.17,53–55 The fluorescence lifetime of Chl bound to PCP is 3 ns, as reported by Kleima et al.19 using time-resolved fluorescence. In the present type of experiment, the nanosecond lifetimes cannot be taken at face value because of possible contributions by annihilation. Therefore, we do not interpret the difference between 3 ns and 1 ns.
 Fig. 5  Evolution-associated difference spectra (EADS) estimated from global analysis of PCP in D2O after 480 nm excitation. 
The first EADS (squares and dashed line in Fig. 5), appears instantaneously (within the IRF), and decays in ∼60 fs into the second EADS. Even if the IRF is adequate to measure such a fast process, the estimated spectrum is highly uncertain due to its mixing with perturbed FID signals.49 This uncertainty limits the interpretation of this component to its lifetime and kinetic connectivity with the other components.
The second EADS (Fig. 5, circles) has a lifetime of 150 fs. It shows a broad ESA (absorption) all across the spectrum, indicating peridinin excited states (cf. the results on peridinin in solution). On top of the broad ESA, bands are identified at 1770(−)/1758(+) cm−1, 1749(−)/1724(+) cm−1, 1718(−)/1708(+) cm−1. All these bands can be assigned to peridinin. Considering the broad, nonspecific absorption of the lowest peridinin excited states, the positive band maxima given here should be considered as tentative. Besides the peridinin signals, Chl-a modes are also observable at 1699 and 1687 cm−1. The associated ESA appears as a broad band at 1666 cm−1 with a shoulder at 1676 cm−1. The third EADS (black triangles) is formed in 150 fs and has a lifetime of 2 ps. It retains the features of the 2nd EADS, indicating that the two EADS describe electronic states that are closely related. In the 3rd EADS, the ESA are slightly blue shifted from 1724 and 1708 cm−1 to 1727 and 1710 cm−1, indicating a vibrational cooling process.
The 4th EADS (dark grey triangles) rises in 2 ps and has a lifetime of 11.5 ps. The 2 ps evolution from the previous EADS is accompanied by major spectral changes. The positive ESA (absorption) that was dominating the previous EADS has disappeared. The Chl-a bleach bands are now strongly present at 1699(−) and 1687(−) cm−1, the associated ESA is found at 1658 cm−1, in agreement with the results shown in Fig. 3. A 2 ps lifetime is typically associated with that of the peridinin ICT state in PCP.17,20,25,53
To determine the processes that underlie the evolution that occurs in 11.5 ps, it is instructive to examine the decay-associated difference spectra (DADS), shown in Fig. SI.3 (ESI†). The 11.5 ps DADS (blue line in Fig. SI.3) can be regarded as a superposition of Chl-a decay (1687 cm−1 and 1699 cm−1 bands) due to Chl-a singlet–singlet annihilation and decay of the slowly transferring peridinin S1 state (ESA below 1720 cm−1 and bleach at 1745 cm−1).55 In the EADS shown in Fig. 5, the 11.5 ps evolution is associated with loss of the 1749 cm−1 band and the appearance of a new band at 1736(−)/1730(+) cm−1, assigned to an ester stretch of Chl-a in agreement with the results shown in Fig. 3.
The 5th EADS (diamonds) rises in 11.5 ps and has a lifetime of 1 ns. The 5th EADS is characterized by a decay time of 1 ns, compatible with the decay time of the Qy singlet excited state of Chl-a in PCP, and contains Chl-a features together with peridinin modes at 1717(−) and 1749(−) cm−1. The 5th EADS decays into the final, nondecaying EADS (light grey triangles), which is characterized by a strong band at 1749(−)/1725(+) cm−1 and weaker bands at 1718(−)/1711(+) cm−1 and 1699(−) cm−1 assigned to two different lactone CO conformers and a keto stretch of Chl-a, respectively. This nondecaying EADS is formed via TEET from Chl-a to peridinin and is assigned to the peridinin triplet state. The Chl-a singlet excited state lifetime of 1 ns is different from that obtained with 660 ns excitation (3 ns). However, because of possible contributions by annihilation we do not interpret these differences.
Peridinin excitation of PCP at 480 nm: target analysis
The EADS that emerge from the global analysis in terms of a sequential model are rather complicated and difficult to interpret as vibrational features of both chromophores are present in each spectrum. This follows from the previously observed fact that after excitation in the peridinin S2 state, a rapid branching occurs in less than 100 fs with excited-state energy flowing into low-lying peridinin states in competition with energy transfer to Chl-a. To properly understand the molecular basis of energy transfer and relaxation in PCP, the spectroscopic signature of each individual state involved in these processes must be determined. In particular, it is anticipated that the mid-IR signatures of the various molecular states will yield information previously not revealed by visible/near IR spectroscopy. To disentangle the contributions by each molecular state to the spectral evolution, we have applied a target analysis to the data with peridinin excitation at 480 nm using a kinetic model based on earlier ultrafast UV-visible data.55 The inset of Fig. 6 (see also Fig. SI.4, ESI†) shows the kinetic scheme describing the PCP dynamics, consisting of six molecular states. After excitation of the peridinin S2 state (dashed line), energy transfer takes place to Chl-a (green line, denoted as Chl Qy) in competition with internal conversion to a hot peridinin S1 state (black line).17,25,55 From the hotS1 state, further energy relaxation takes place to a vibrationally relaxed S1 state (blue line, denoted as S1) and an intramolecular ICT state (red line). From the ICT state, energy transfer takes place to Chl-a. The vibrationally relaxed S1 state transfers energy to Chl-a and internally converts to the ground state. Finally, Chl-a partly relaxes to the ground state and undergoes intersystem crossing to the triplet state (magenta line). The yields and rate constants are reported in Fig. SI.4 (ESI†). Each state corresponds to a species-associated difference spectrum (SADS), as displayed in Fig. 6. Some spectra have been rescaled to allow better comparison (scaling factors are reported in the caption of Fig. 6). Kinetic traces at selected vibrational frequencies are reported in Fig. 7. Concentration profiles associated with the SADS are shown in Fig. SI.5 (ESI†).

Upon excitation, the optically allowed S2 state of peridinin decays in about 60 fs, populating the hotS1 and Chl-a. The lifetime of this component is consistent with the 66 fs lifetime found for peridinin S2 in PCP by fluorescence up-conversion.56 The SADS of the S2 state shows a high similarity with the first EADS observed in similar experiments on peridinin dissolved in CHCl3 and MeOH, Fig. 2A and B. It should be noted, however, that at these early time delays, effects from the perturbed FID may strongly affect the spectra, and therefore we refrain from further physical interpretation.
The Chl-a compartment is populated by energy transfer from the carotenoid through S2, hotS1 and ICT, and follows a bi-exponential decay with characteristic lifetimes of 31 ps and 1.5 ns. The first phase of 31 ps describes annihilation on Chl-a, in agreement with the 45 ps lifetime found with 660 nm excitation. After annihilation, 70% of the excited Chl-a decays to the ground state in 1.5 ns, and 30% forms the non-decaying component by intersystem crossing and TEET (3[PCP] spectrum in Fig. 6). The Chl-a SADS is similar to that observed with direct excitation at 660 nm (Fig. 3) but better resolved as a result of a superior signal to noise ratio. It shows the 9-ketos at 1699(−), 1687(−)/1659(+) cm−1 (kinetic traces in Fig. 7F, H and I), and the two 10a-esters at 1749(−) and 1737(−) cm−1 (Fig. 7A and C; Table 2). The absorption at 1728 cm−1 and the bleach at 1717 cm−1 (Fig. 7D) are assigned to a contribution by peridinin lactone modes, possibly resulting from excitonic coupling between Chl-a and peridinin.55,57

The hotS1 state (Fig. 6, black symbols and line) decays in 150 fs to populate vibrationally relaxed S1, ICT and Chl-a (Qy). Interpretation of the SADS of the hotS1 state should be conducted with some caution as perturbed FID signals may still contribute to the signals at these early times. The hotS1 SADS is characterized by a broad, nonspecific absorption extending over the entire probed spectral window with specific bleach and induced absorption bands superimposed, as observed for peridinin in solution (Fig. 2 and ref. 45). The broad absorption renders the assignment of specific bleach and induced absorptions difficult. However, from the literature the negative-going bands can be assigned. A list of band positions and interpretations is given in Table 2. Because the IR data are taken at 6 cm−1 intervals, spectral fitting is applied to accurately determine the bleach maxima of the peridinin lactone vibrational bands. Spectral fits of the carbonyl bleach band are summarized in Table SI.1 (ESI†). Fig. SI.6 (ESI†) shows the spectral fit of the ICT SADS. The bands at 1748 and 1720 cm−1 originate from the peridinin lactone carbonyl41 (Papagiannakis and Robert, unpublished work). The negative-going bands at 1699 and 1687 cm−1 can clearly be assigned to the 9-ketos of Chl-a (Fig. 3 and ref. 46). Assigning the positive-going features in this SADS is awkward because one cannot a priori distinguish a bleach/induced absorption (band shift) feature from a bleach superimposed on a broad background. This is especially true for hotS1 because its short lifetime (150 fs) will result in a significant line broadening of the vibrationally excited modes by ∼30 cm−1.
The peridinin S1 state is directly formed by the decay of hotS1. The S1 SADS (blue symbols and line) is characterized by a prominent bleach at 1750 cm−1 that can readily be assigned to the peridinin lactone carbonyl. Strikingly, the amplitude of this band is much larger than that observed in peridinin in solution, where only a small dip on an otherwise broad absorption is observed in this region (Fig. 2, ref. 45). This larger amplitude implies that the oscillator strength of the peridinin lactone carbonyl is much higher when bound to PCP than in organic solvent, or that in solution the lactone bleach is largely compensated by induced absorption in the transient IR spectrum. The S1 SADS has a broad, rather featureless absorption from 1740 to 1650 cm−1, with negative-going dips at 1700 and 1685 cm−1. These dips are at a position similar to that of the Chl-a 9-ketos in the Chl-a and hotS1 SADS, but are less resolved. In fact, peridinin in chloroform (Fig. 2A) shows similar dips at 1705 and 1685 cm−1 suggesting that they are, at least partly, intrinsic to the peridinin S1 state. Notably, the S1 SADS shows signatures of vibrational cooling when compared to the hotS1 SADS with an upshift of absorption features from 1724 to 1728 cm−1, from 1706 to 1710 cm−1 and 1724 to 1730 cm−1 (see Table 2).
The peridinin ICT state is also directly populated from hotS1. The ICT state represents the main energy transfer channel to Chl-a at a rate of (2 ps)−1. Its SADS (red symbols and line) shows an overall pattern similar to that of S1, but differs in a number of important aspects. Foremost, it shows a lactone carbonyl bleach at 1745 cm−1, which is downshifted by 5 cm−1 with respect to S1. The downshift of the lactone mode in the ground state may be due to a more polar environment of this particular (pool of) peridinin(s), which in turn promotes the intramolecular charge-transfer character of peridinin upon excitation. In the ICT SADS, as for hotS1, the negative-going doublet at 1699 cm and 1687 cm−1 is observed, assigned to the Chl-a 9-keto vibrations (cf.Fig. 3 and the green Chl-a SADS in Fig. 6). Such a distinct Chl-a contribution in the mid-IR spectrum is not observed for the peridinin S1 state.
The 3[PCP] triplet SADS, (magenta line), is associated with the long-lived triplet state in PCP. This SADS shows contributions from both peridinin and Chl-a as already seen following 660 nm excitation. The 9-keto bleach vibrations are visible at 1701 cm−1 (Chl-a 601) and 1687 cm−1 (Chl-a 602). The peridinin lactone CO stretch contributions are present with bands at 1748(−)/1725(+) cm−1 (with a shoulder at 1737(−) cm−1 assigned to 10a-ester of Chl-a 601) and at 1717(−) cm−1. The coexistence of 3[Per] and 3[Chl-a] features in the PCP triplet spectrum is assigned to a triplet state delocalized between peridinin and Chl-a, and is consistent with the results from time-resolved FTIR spectroscopy.48,58
Discussion
The mid-IR signatures of excited peridinin and Chl-a
By applying a target analysis to the time-resolved mid-IR data, we have determined the IR signatures of the various molecular states that transiently exist during the excited-state energy transfer and relaxation processes in PCP. It is particularly interesting to compare the IR spectra of peridinin in the S1 state and in the ICT state, as these states have distinct properties, in solution as well as bound to PCP.5,16,24,25,55 In the visible, the ICT state is characterized by an excited-state absorption that is significantly red-shifted with respect to that of S1, and by the presence of a pronounced emission in the near-IR.24,25 In the mid-IR, however, the S1 and ICT states of peridinin do not exhibit distinctly different spectral features when bound to PCP. Apart from different lactone frequencies, the induced absorption patterns are similar with a broad, nonspecific absorption ranging from 1760 to 1660 cm−1 (Fig. 6). This observation agrees with our results on peridinin in solution (Fig. 2A,B) and those of Van Tassle et al.: excitation of peridinin in a polar or nonpolar solvent gives rise to IR spectra of ICT and S1 states that are very similar (Fig. 2 and ref. 45). Thus, even if a peridinin structural change accompanies the separate relaxation pathways into the S1 and ICT states,23 such putative changes remain minor to the extent that the IR spectrum does not change noticeably. The downshift of the lactone mode in the peridinin ICT state may result from a more polar environment of these particular peridinins, which in turn promotes formation of the ICT state upon excitation by lowering the energy of the CT state.
It was previously observed that excitation of Chl-a in PCP results in a prompt bleach signal at 530 nm, assigned to excitonic or charge-transfer coupling between peridinin and Chl-a.55,57 For singlet-excited Chl-a, we observe a 1720 cm−1 bleach feature which may be assigned to a peridinin lactone (Fig. 6, green line). It also shows a bleach at 1750 cm−1 that either belongs to Chl-a 10a-ester, or a peridinin lactone. Ultrafast polarized visible spectroscopy has shown that Per624/614 are probably responsible for the prompt bleach at 530 nm.55,57 Thus, Per624/614 have their lactone frequencies at 1720 cm−1 and, possibly, at 1750 cm−1, as will be substantiated below.
In the SADS assigned to excited-state peridinin, distinct contributions from Chl-a are observed. In the hotS1 and ICT states, clear Chl-a 9-keto bleaches are observed at 1699 and 1685 cm−1 (Fig. 6, black and red curves). On the other hand, the peridinin (vibrationally relaxed) S1 state (blue line) does not exhibit an obvious Chl-a 9-keto signal. This observation suggests that the strong electric field generated by the ICT state and its precursor, hotS1, induces a vibrational Stark effect on the Chl-a 9-keto modes, causing them to shift frequency or to lose oscillator strength. The peridinin S1 state does not, or to a less extent exhibit a charge-transfer character, which explains the absence of a Chl-a 9-keto signal in its SADS. Note that the initially excited peridinin S2 state possesses a large charge-transfer character59 which makes it reasonable to assume that hotS1 does so as well. We previously reported that the IR spectrum of the PCP triplet state bears features of both peridinin triplet and Chl-a triplet states, which we assigned to delocalization of the wavefunction among peridinin and Chl-a.48,58
Assignment of Chl-a carbonyl vibrations
Using fluorescence line narrowing spectroscopy (FLN), Kleima et al. identified two different Chl-a 9-keto stretch vibrations at 1697 and 1681 cm−1,46 in good agreement with the 9-keto vibrations observed here at 1699(−) and 1687(−) cm−1. To explain the observation of two different frequencies, Kleima suggested that the two emitting Chl-a experience different environments. Our data reinforce and corroborate Kleima's idea showing in addition to the two 9-keto vibrations, the corresponding 10a-ester vibrations. The different frequencies for the 10a-ester and 9-keto vibrations of the two Chl-a indicate the presence of weak H-bonds or a difference in polarity environment for the two Chl-a binding sites. No H-bonds involving the chlorin rings could be found in the crystal structure,12 but a difference between the two binding sites has been identified. In the protein the two Chl-a are surrounded by hydrophobic (apolar) and hydrophilic (polar) residues together with the peridinin molecules. Neglecting the actions of carotenoids, having their apolar backbone next to the chlorines, and only taking into account the residues to estimate the degree of polarity of the Chl-a environment, a slightly more polar binding site is assignable to the Chl-a 602. In Table SI.2 (ESI†), we list the main polar residues that surround the two Chl-a, identifying a group of residues that are conserved for both chlorine molecules, while other additional polar residues are only present in the binding site that hosts the Chl-a 602. These residues are not close enough to form H bridges, but their presence definitely change the local polarity that Chl-a 602 experience with respect to the Chl-a 601. This must be the key difference that makes the two Chl-a distinct from other; the higher polarity will stabilize the carbonyl groups of the Chl-a 602 shifting their vibrations to lower frequencies. Based on this observation, together with the comparison between 9-keto bleach intensities in the fifth and sixth SADS in Fig. 6, we assign the low-frequency 10a-ester and high-frequency 9-keto vibration at 1736(−)/1730(+) and 1699(−)/1670(+) cm−1 to Chl-a 601 and the vibrations at 1752(−)/1743(+) and 1687(−)/1658(+) cm−1 to Chl-a 602.
Identification of energy transfer pathways in PCP
The ultrafast IR experiments on PCP provide a unique opportunity to identify site-specific energy transfer processes through the lactone frequencies of particular peridinins. From the target analysis presented in Fig. 6 it is clear that the lactone frequency of the peridinin carrying the ICT state (1745 cm−1, red line) is different from the peridinin carrying the triplet state (1748 cm−1, magenta line). This observation implies that the main singlet and triplet energy transfer pathways in the PCP complex are distinct. Overall, we can identify four bleaches associated with peridinin lactone in PCP: 1750, 1748, 1745 and 1717 cm−1. These frequencies agree quite well with those observed on the microsecond timescale with step-scan FTIR spectroscopy, where lactone bleaches were found at 1745, 1741 and 1720 cm−1. Resonant Raman studies of PCP excited at 476 nm reveal two broad bands at 1745 and 1723 cm−1 with a shoulder at 1742 cm−1 (Papagiannakis and Robert, unpublished data). In the following, we will identify singlet and triplet energy transfer pathways in PCP on the basis of the observed peridinin lactone frequencies and assign them to the particular peridinins.
In the triplet state, the main lactone bleach is found at 1748 cm−1 (Fig. 6, magenta line) and at 1745 cm−1 by Alexandre et al.48 The discrepancy of 3 cm−1 falls within the spectral resolution of the experiments (6 cm−1 here and 8 cm−1 in ref. 48) and the uncertainties in the absolute calibration procedure of the femtosecond IR apparatus. Note that this does not imply that the observed 3 cm−1 difference between triplet and ICT lactone frequencies in the ultrafast IR experiments is uncertain, because the latter are measured within a dataset on the same apparatus, and thus have the same relative calibration.
Recently, Carbonera and co-workers using optically detected magnetic resonance and pulsed EPR techniques, identified Per624/614 as the main acceptor of Chl-a triplets.60,61 Given that triplet–triplet migration among the peridinins is unlikely to occur in the PCP complex,60 it is fair to state that the main lactone bleaches in the femto-IR (1748 cm−1) and step-scan FTIR (1745 cm−1) experiments represent the same peridinin pair, identified as Per624/614. In addition, a smaller bleach in the triplet state is observed at 1720 cm−1, indicating a fraction or subpopulation of Per624/614 with a downshifted lactone frequency.
The slowly-transferring peridinin S1 state makes a minor contribution to the total energy transfer process to Chl-a. It has its lactone frequency at 1750 cm−1 (blue line in Fig. 6). Per622/612 were proposed earlier to carry the slowly-transferring S1 state.55 At this point it is of interest to recall the properties of the so-called high-salt PCP complex (HSPCP). HSPCP appears as a minor fraction in the PCP isolation procedure and slightly differs from main-form PCP (referred to as PCP in this manuscript) in amino acid composition, molar mass, antigenicity, absorption and fluorescence properties.62 The single most important structural difference between high-salt PCP and main-form PCP is that Per622/612 are absent in the former complex.63 Most interestingly, the peridinin-to- Chl-a energy transfer dynamics are essentially the same in high-salt PCP as compared to main-form PCP.64,65 Thus, Per622/612 almost certainly carry the S1 state, representing the slow, minor energy transfer pathway to Chl-a.
In PCP, the peridinin ICT state represents the main excited-state energy donor to Chl-a. The peridinins carrying the ICT state have their lactone frequency at 1745 cm−1. This sets them apart from the peridinins carrying the S1 and triplet states, which have their lactones at 1750 and 1748 cm−1, respectively. As the latter have been identified as Per622/612 and Per624/614, respectively, it follows that the ICT state localizes mainly on Per621/611 and/or Per623/613.
Overall, the excited-state energy transfer and relaxation pathways in PCP can be summarized as follows: upon excitation of peridinin in its main band at 480 nm, exciton relaxation among the strongly coupled peridinins may take place in the S2 state66 prior to a direct transfer of 25% of the energy to Chl-a, and to internal conversion to low-lying peridinin excited states. Excitation of PCP at 480 nm preferentially populates Per622/612, Per621/611 and Per623/613, whereas the Per624/614 pair becomes hardly populated. After relaxation from the S2 state, Per621/611 and Per623/613 evolve into the low-lying ICT state which is promoted by a more polar environment and constitute the main energy transfer channel to Chl-a. Per622/612 evolve into the S1 state and are weakly coupled to Chl-a, representing a minor fraction of energy transfer to Chl-a with a lifetime of 12 ps. After excited-state energy transfer to Chl-a is complete, intersystem crossing to the Chl-a triplet state takes place, followed by triplet–triplet energy transfer to Per624/614. The latter process is rate-limited by the Chl-a singlet-excited state lifetime. Thus, our observations imply that upon excitation at 480 nm, singlet and triplet energy transfer pathways are to a significant extent separated.
