    , Accepted 18th December 2015First published on 18th December 2015AbstractOrganic–inorganic perovskite solar cells have attracted huge research interest due to rapid improvement in device performance showing great potential to be the next generation flexible solar cells. Unique defect properties in perovskite have been considered as the possible mechanism for the superior performance, and closely relevant to the effects of hysteresis and light soaking. To date, the quantitative correlation and in-depth understanding of defects in organic–inorganic perovskite are still lacking although extensive investigation have been undertaken. Here we study defect trapping states and carrier recombination dynamics in organic–inorganic halide perovskites. At low excitation the photoluminescence (PL) intensity exhibits a super-linear increase with increasing excitation, due to the slow depopulation rate of the defect states. The steady state and time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) carried out in this work reveal that the carrier recombination dynamics is ultimately correlated with both the defect density and the relaxation rate of the carriers in defects. A model is established for the relationship between the properties of the defect trapping state and steady state PL intensity. Two key parameters, (i) the ratio of the trap-state density to the depopulation rate of trapped states and (ii) ratio of the maximum density of covalence band electrons to the trapping rate, can be extracted from the model based on the excitation dependent steady state PL. This work demonstrates that the properties of defect trapping states are closely related to the fabrication technique, and suggests that the organic–inorganic halide perovskite is partly defect-tolerant.
Introduction
Organic–inorganic halide perovskite has attracted great research interest as a promising photovoltaic material due to the unprecedentedly rapid progress in conversion efficiency.1–5 In understanding the properties of the perovskite and their effects on device performance,6–9 many advanced characterization techniques have been used, for example, the morphology of the perovskite film,10–13 time-resolved spectroscopy techniques.14–17 Carrier dynamics in perovskites is of critical importance for the performance of the solar devices and fundamental understanding.18–20 Defect states of the perovskites have been shown to be closely correlated with the photoexcited carrier dynamics and performance of the solar cells.14,21,22 The unusual defect physics has been suggested to be the possible origins of the superior solar cell performance in such organic–inorganic halide perovskites.8,23–26 Moreover, the defect states are also correlated with the mobile ions and exhibit ultraslow dynamics up to seconds or minutes; thus it is of crucial importance for understanding the effects of hysteresis and light soaking.27–32 The formation of defects and possible migration in perovskite were proposed based on the computation.24,27,31 To date, the defect physics and relevant carrier dynamics have not yet been fully understood although they are of critical importance for improving the performance of perovskite-based solar cells.8,21,22 Some observations are still controversial, for example, what is the role of defect trapping in the carrier recombination, and which recombination process, free electron–hole recombination or Auger recombination, dominates the carrier recombination at high injection.14,15,19,26,33,34
In this investigation, the defect trapping states of CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite and the photoexcited carrier dynamics were experimentally studied and theoretically modeled. The steady state and time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) carried out in this work reveal that the carrier recombination dynamics is closely correlated with both the depopulation rate of the carriers in defects and the density of defect states. A model is established for the relationship between the steady state PL intensity and the properties of the defect trapping state. Two key parameters, (i) the ratio of the trap-state density to the depopulation lifetime of trapped states and (ii) ratio of the maximum density of covalence band electrons to the trapping lifetime, can be extracted based on the excitation dependent PL intensity. It is confirmed that the defect properties are dependent on the fabrication technique used for the solar cells. The experiment suggests that organic–inorganic halide perovskite is partly defect-tolerant. The model established in this work and the ability to extract these parameters are useful for identifying key carrier characteristics beneficial for the high performance of perovskite solar cells. This is important for future work in optimizing perovskite solar cell devices for better performance.
Results and discussion
The samples used in this study include identical CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite fabricated by a conventional spin coating (SC) and gas-assisted (GA) solution processing technique.35 The fabrication details, microscopic images (Fig. S1) as well as the absorption and PL spectra (Fig. S2) are shown in the ESI.† To avoid the influence, an integrating sphere was used for absorption measurements. It is clear that the SC sample has large grains, and also contains voids. The GA sample on the other hand has better surface coverage with smaller grains compared. The GA sample exhibits evidently larger absorption coefficient than that of the SC sample, which is attributed to the higher density and higher coverage, consistent with the microscopic images. Both samples exhibit efficient photoluminescence (PL) at 770 nm, consistent with the other observations.12,36–38
The intensity of steady state PL (ssPL) was measured as a function of excitation intensity in each sample. Fig. 1 shows the PL intensity vs. excitation intensity on a double-logarithmic scale. The carrier dynamics in perovskite can be expressed as: , where the terms correspond to the Shockley–Read–Hall (SRH) recombination via sub-bandgap trap states, free electron–hole recombination (bimolecular) and Auger recombination, respectively.15,16,19,39 Different from the conventional semiconductors, it has been reported that continuous illumination (tens of seconds or longer) can result in PL quantum yield changes (both increase and decrease), which are ascribed to light curing or ion enhanced nonradiative recombination.30,40,41 To avoid the complexity due to long illumination, we minimize the excitation both for ssPL and TRPL. During the ssPL measurement, the samples remain in the dark except the PL measurement duration for only a couple of seconds. In TRPL measurements, the illumination point was shifted for each measurement with a short integral time (20 s and 40 s) for high and low excitation, respectively. The ssPL intensity and the quantum yield depend on the competition between radiative recombination (bimolecular) and nonradiative recombination (defect assisted and Auger).18,39,42 Generally, equation IPL ∝ IkEX is used to describe the one- or multiple photon dominated process, with k photon number.12,42–45 For a general single photon excitation PL the slope should be approximately equal to 1 in double-logarithmic coordinates if quantum yield remains constant. The power factors are extracted from the experimental data with k = 1.619 and k = 1.820 for SC and GA samples, respectively. It should be noted that the power factors decrease evidently at the high excitation intensity for each sample, 1.035 and 1.445 for SC and GA samples at around 5 W cm−2, respectively. Obviously, in this case it is not relevant to the two-photon process.46 The larger than one power factor is ascribed to the increased contribution from bimolecular recombination with increasing excitation intensity, because of the saturation of the trapping states, as discussed in detail later. To clarify this, we performed excitation intensity dependent PL decay measurements using time correlated single photon counting (TCSPC). Fig. 2a and b show the PL decay curves at various excitation intensities. Using the bi-exponential y = A1exp(−t/τ1) + A2exp(−t/τ2) fitting, each PL decay trace can be nicely fitted to determine the decay times of the fast (τ1) and slow (τ2) components, as well as the weights of the fast component. The fast components and the corresponding weights are summarised in Fig. 2c and d. The slow component τ2, generally ascribed to recombination time, is determined from the bi-exponential fitting to be 150 ns and 230 ns in SC and GA samples, respectively, similar to those reported in other studies.37

 Fig. 2  The PL decay in (a) SC and (b) GA samples at various excitation intensities; and the decay times of the fast component and its weight in (c) SC and (d) GA samples, respectively. The inset shows the PL intensity under continuous illumination at a constant intensity of 100 mW cm−2 of the SC sample (black) and the GA sample (red). 
The fast component can be attributed to the defect trapping,24,26,47,48 and dominates the PL decay under very low excitations regardless of the type of deposition technique used. Upon increasing the excitation the decay time increases and the weight of the fast component decreases. This phenomenon implies a systematic change in the recombination mechanisms related to trap states. Another interesting observation is that the GA sample has a larger fast component and shorter decay times compared to the SC sample, which can be ascribed to its more effective defect trapping and de-saturation than the SC sample. This highlights the effect and the relevance of the fabrication process on the carrier dynamics in particular those related to defect trapping states. Using completely different conditions (fixed point with continuous illumination for minutes) a change in PL decay from fast to slow was observed, indicating the light curing closely relevant to the defect.40,41
Further investigation by monitoring PL intensities of SC and GA samples under continuous constant low intensity illumination shows that the PL intensity of the SC sample increases over time in tens of seconds, while the PL intensity of the GA sample remains constant; see the inset of Fig. 2a. This is further evidence that the GA sample is more effective in de-saturation.
To obtain insight into the defect trapping states, we model the carrier dynamic processes by attributing the super-linear increase of PL intensity to the competition between the free electron–hole recombination and SRH recombination via defect trapping.49–51 The linear increase at the high excitation level on the other hand is attributed to the saturation of the trapping states and enhanced free electron–hole recombination. The defect trapping has a higher rate than the electron–hole recombination if the defect states have high availability. With increasing excitation intensity the availability of defect states decreases; thus the defect trapping rate will decrease. As illustrated in Fig. 3, either the density Nt or depopulation lifetime tp of the defect trapping states can impact the saturation process. In both cases, unoccupied states reappear at the sub-bandgap energy level, allowing for the SRH recombination of photoexcited electrons via the trapping states (Fig. 3). This argument supports the conclusion that a larger Nt and a shorter tp have equivalent effects in terms of controlling the excitation level at which the saturation of trap states occurs.
 Fig. 3  Saturation of the sub-bandgap trap states and de-saturation by either increasing the trap-state density Nt or reducing the depopulation lifetime tp. 
To model the steady state PL process, the saturation and desaturation of shallow defect states18,23,24 are taken into account, including a single “effective” trap-state energy level for simplicity. This defect energy level is assumed to sit close to the conduction band (CB) edge and thereby traps electrons more effectively (trapping time tn ≪ tp).23,24 It should be noted that if the trapping-state energy level is close to the valence band (VB) edge, this model is still valid by swapping the electron-related parameters with hole-related parameters. The asymmetric alignment of the sub-bandgap energy level has been adopted in the literature18,24 and in this work.
The rate of electrons being trapped by the defect states Rn and the rate of defect states being depopulated and relaxing trapped electrons to the valence band are expressed, respectively, by49,51 Rn = [n(1 − ft) − NieβΔft]/tn(1) Rp = [pft − Nie−βΔ(1 − ft)]/tp(2)where Δ = Et − Ei is the energy difference between the trap state energy level Et and the intrinsic Fermi level Ei. n and p are the concentrations of free electrons and holes, respectively. ft denotes the occupation probability of the shallow defect states (0 ≤ ft ≤ 1) and Ni is the intrinsic carrier concentration. All the parameters are summarized in Table 3. The lifetimes of the saturation and the depopulation processes are denoted by tn and tp, respectively. According to our assumption, tn ≪ tp, at the steady state an equilibrium is established between the saturation and depopulation processes, i.e. Rn = Rp. After algebraic manipulation this condition leads to (3)where β = 1/KT, K is Boltzmann's constant and T is the temperature in Kelvin. And further algebraic manipulation (see eqn (S1) to (S13) in the ESI† for details of the derivation) (4)where the normalized concentration of conduction-band electrons  is a function of the normalized PL intensity Ipl (see eqn (S18) in the ESI†). α, d and Eph denote the absorption coefficient at the excitation wavelength, the sample thickness and the incident photon energy, a1, a2 and a3 are constants, respectively. The PL intensities and electron density are normalized by their maximum value for simplicity, as elucidated in the ESI.† The Auger recombination is not included in eqn (4), because at the considered power intensities the Auger recombination is weaker than the free electron–hole recombination processes.19 In fact, being a wide-gap semiconductor, CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite has a limited rate of Auger recombination and is significant only when the concentration ratio is high enough to generate hot carriers.52 In the power intensity range that is considered here, it is not enough to make the Auger process a dominant recombination mechanism.

Eqn (4) reflects the fact that at steady state the rate of photogenerated carriers is balanced by the total rate of recombination processes. Two major recombination mechanisms are taken into account,14,18,39 including the SRH recombination and the band-to-band recombination, whose rates are expressed by the first and second terms in eqn (4). Eqn (4) provides a fitting scheme on the measurable relationship between the intensity of excitations (in the unit of mW cm−2) and the normalized PL intensities. As a result of this fitting scheme, three parameters a1, a2 and a3 are obtained (from eqn (S15)–(S17) in the ESI,† respectively) which are constants, important in determining the two physical parameters: (5)
The first parameter is a ratio of the trap-state density Nt to the depopulation lifetime of trapped electrons tp. The second parameter is a ratio of the free carrier density at the maximum excitation power (∼5 W cm−2), nm, to the trapping lifetime tn. Here nm is used to normalize actual electron density into a pure number , its amount can be obtained by simply fitting the ssPL curve based on this proposed model. It is noted that the two ratios are the only parameters that can be determined by the power-dependent ssPL experiment itself. This is because a larger density of defects Nt effectively offsets the increase of desaturation lifetime tp, as explained in Fig. 3 and the discussion above. On the other hand, nm is proportional to the carrier population lifetime tn. It should be noted that the absolute values of free electron density cannot be determined from the ssPL, but a relative PL intensity.

Fig. 4 compares the proposed model fit with the experimental data and the three parameters a1, a2 and a3 are obtained, as listed in Table 1; as well as the values of Nt/tp and nm/tn. The results show that the GA sample exhibits a larger degree of de-saturation than the SC sample although it has a lower ratio of CB electrons to the trapping lifetime.

Comparing the standard equation for the SRH recombination rate (eqn (S1) to (S9) in the ESI†) with the rate equation used by Stranks et al.,18 the following relations are found: (Nttn)−1 = Rpop, (Nttp)−1 = Rdep.(6)where Rpop and Rdep are constants that characterize the population rate of trap states and the depopulation rate of electrons, respectively. Rather than the lifetimes tp and tn, Rpop and Rdep measure the probabilities of trapping/releasing an electron by a single defect state, and thus only depend on the types of defect states. If assuming SC and GA samples have the same type defect states due to the identical material and similar fabrication, and only different in their total amount, then we can safely adopt the published values of Rpop and Rdep.18 This allows the values of Nt, nm, tp, and tn to be determined (Table 2).

Moreover, the population and depopulation lifetimes, as well as the densities of photogenerated species, can be further determined based on the density of trap states.
As shown in Fig. 5(a) and 6(a), the photoexcited electrons in CB (red dotted line) increase approximately linearly with the excitation power in both samples. Under low excitations, the density of CB electrons is much lower than that of electrons trapped at the defect states (black line). In this case, the defect states act as effective recombination centers, capturing most of the photoexcited carriers. At high excitations, the electron density at the trap states approaches saturation (plateau of red curve). As sub-bandgap states are occupied, the major decay path of CB electrons will be via direct band-to-band recombination, consistent with observation shown in Fig. 2.

 Fig. 6  (a) Excitation dependencies of the densities of CB electrons, VB holes and electrons trapped in subgap states in the GA sample. (b) Excitation dependencies of the rates of SRH recombination and band-to-band recombination in the GA sample. 
The recombination rates of both samples are illustrated in Fig. 5(b) and 6(b), respectively. The rate of trap-assisted recombination follows the standard SRH equation. The band-to-band recombination rate is the difference between the photo-generation rate and the SRH recombination rate, assuming a negligible contribution from bound-state (excitonic) emission.18,19,34,53,54 If further attributing the radiative process to the band-to-band recombination, the PL efficiency is calculated as the ratio of the band-to-band recombination rate to the total recombination rate.
By comparing both samples, the SC sample exhibits a lower density of sub-bandgap states (blue line in Fig. 6(a)) as well as a longer depopulation time (Table 2). Therefore, recombination via trap states in this sample is less effective than that in the GA sample, which is preferable for the purpose of making optoelectronic devices. However the more effective de-saturation in the GA sample is more favorable for photovoltaic devices and for lessening hysteresis. Both samples have demonstrated slightly larger density of trap states compared to values reported in the literature obtained via time-resolved spectroscopy.18 The high conversion efficiency in GA perovskite based solar cells (17%) and the higher defect density suggest that organic–inorganic halide perovskite is partly defect-tolerant. At low excitation, the super-linear increase of PL intensity with excitation intensity in log–log representation, IPL ∝ IkEX, suggests that the defect state trapping has decreased proportion due to saturation filling of the defect states and thus the bimolecular recombination exhibits the super-linear increase. The power factor k roughly represents the saturation degree; and the larger power factor k corresponds to the larger density of defect states.
Conclusion
In summary, we have investigated the defect correlated photoexcited carrier dynamics in CH3NH3PbI3 perovskites. At low excitation, the PL intensity exhibits a super-linear increase with excitation intensity in log–log representation, suggesting that the defect state trapping has decreased proportion due to filling saturation of the defect states. A model is established based on the experiment of PL intensity as a function of excitation intensity. Two key parameters that represent (i) the ratio of the trap-state density to the depopulation lifetime of trapped states and (ii) a ratio of the maximum density of covalence band electrons to the trapping lifetime can be extracted from the model. These parameters are dependent on the fabrication technique used for the solar cells under investigation. Cells with better performance that use the recently developed gas-assisted solution processing show a higher ratio of trap-state density to the depopulation lifetime and a lower ratio of covalence band electron density to the trapping lifetime. These suggest that the organic–inorganic halide perovskite is partly defect-tolerant. These parameters are shown to be closely relevant to the carrier dynamics, as indicated by steady state and time-resolved PL. The model established in this work will be useful for future cell optimization for better device performance.

 	Fig. 1  PL intensity as a function of excitation intensity for (a) SC and (b) GA perovskite samples. Both figures are plotted on logarithmic scales so that the power factors can be obtained by linear fitting in the low-injection regime and in the high-injection regime.	 

 	Fig. 2  The PL decay in (a) SC and (b) GA samples at various excitation intensities; and the decay times of the fast component and its weight in (c) SC and (d) GA samples, respectively. The inset shows the PL intensity under continuous illumination at a constant intensity of 100 mW cm−2 of the SC sample (black) and the GA sample (red).	 

 	Fig. 3  Saturation of the sub-bandgap trap states and de-saturation by either increasing the trap-state density Nt or reducing the depopulation lifetime tp.
