However, there are still a large number of challenges to overcome in order for solar water splitting to become a practically viable technology that can replace current hydrogen production from fossil fuels. The most critical barrier is the light absorber, which can convert solar photons to charge carriers to conduct the water splitting reaction. Iron-containing metal oxides, commonly called “ferrites”, are a relatively recently explored class of materials owing to their unadulterated merits of earth abundancy, nontoxicity, and intrinsic stability in aqueous solutions. They generally have small band gaps, which are suitable to harvest sufficient amounts of photon flux from the solar spectrum, and suitable band positions to drive the redox reactions of water splitting. Unfortunately, their performance is fairly poor at the moment in comparison to that of other well-established materials, primarily because of their indirect bandgap characteristics and poor charge carrier dynamics. Another reason is that these materials have been studied as photoelectrodes only recently, and the time spent on their development is not as long as that of well-developed materials. Hence, intensive research should be continued to obtain a fundamental understanding of ferrite materials, develop ingenious synthetic methods, and improve their performance by various modification strategies to transform them into viable photoelectrodes. In this review, we summarise the current state of the progress made in specific ferrite-based photoelectrodes for overall water splitting and provide a perspective of the major challenges and opportunities they face.Jeong Hun KimJeong Hun Kim received his Bachelor's degree from Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology (UNIST), Republic of Korea, in 2016 and joined the research group of Prof. Jae Sung Lee.

1. Introduction
Solar energy utilization is deemed to be the most promising way to address both global energy and environmental issues. World energy consumption in 2017 was 17.91 TW; ∼70% of this energy was supplied by fossil fuels that emit carbon dioxide, which is the main cause of global warming.1 Meanwhile, solar energy has an annual illumination of 173000 TW, which far exceeds the expected annual consumption in 2050 (∼30 TW).2–5 However, solar energy is highly diffuse, with a typical power density of ∼100 mW cm−2 under 1 sun conditions (AM 1.5G); it is intermittent as well.3 Hence, technologies are needed to harvest the abundant solar energy and transform it into a convenient energy form, such as heat (solar thermal), electricity (photovoltaics, PV) or fuels (solar fuels).
Conversion of solar energy into chemical energy (chemicals and fuels) has received immense attention recently because chemicals can be easily stored, transported, and utilized using existing infrastructures. The technology also closely resembles natural photosynthesis, and the systems of solar-to-chemical energy conversion (called “artificial photosynthesis”) include photocatalysis (PC), photoelectrochemical cells (PECs) and photovoltaic cell–electrolyzers (PV–ECs).3,6Fig. 1 illustrates the principle of solar water splitting to produce hydrogen energy as an example. Hydrogen is an eco-friendly fuel that burns with zero harmful emission and produces only water. It has a higher gravimetric heating value (141.9 MJ kg−1) than most conventional fossil fuels (gasoline 47.5 MJ kg−1, diesel 44.8 MJ kg−1). The energy required for overall water splitting is +237 kJ mol−1, or 1.23 eV per electron. This energy plus additional energy to overcome the kinetic barrier (overpotential) of the reaction should be supplied by sunlight through a photocatalytic or photovoltaic light absorber. Hence, the efficiencies of conversion systems depend primarily on the performance of their light absorbers. Detailed technoeconomical analyses7,8 indicate that the most important cost factor of these cells is their materials, especially the material of the light absorber, which also determines the solar-to-hydrogen (STH) conversion efficiency and stability. Jacobsson stated specifically that the employed material matters more than the configuration of the device.9 In this regard, light absorbers should be composed of earth-abundant, inexpensive and relatively less toxic materials.

While solar energy is indeed the most uniformly distributed natural resource throughout the Earth, this is not the case for the elements needed to compose overall water splitting devices. It was estimated that ∼0.3% of the Earth's surface should be covered by light harvesting and utilization systems to fully power the worldwide energy demand, with a solar conversion efficiency of 10%.10 Vesborg and Jaramillo11 checked the earth abundance of elements required to meet the energy demand; they found fundamental problems with some of the elements, e.g. Bi and Te. Some staple elements are used to compose semiconductor light absorbers, such as Ga, In, Ge, P, Te, Se and S, accompanied with Cu, Cd and In, Ga calcogenides.12,13 Many of these elements are not abundant in the Earth's crust. Thus, earth abundance is another important criterion to consider together with the price, as presented in Fig. 2. The abundant elements include Si, Fe, Al, Ca, Mg, Ba, Ti, O, S, N, P, C, etc., while the shortage of elements commonly used in electrocatalysts, such as Pt, Ir, Ru, and Rh, is of serious concern to realise large scale hydrogen generation.14

Among solar-to-chemical conversion systems, this review article focusses on PEC cells, which are composed with photoelectrodes as light absorbers.16 Since the discovery of TiO2 photoanode for overall water splitting in 1976 by Fujishima and Honda,17 there have been steady developments in materials to improve the light absorption, conversion efficiency, and durability of photoelectrodes.18,19 The durability of photoelectrodes is a particularly important consideration for practical applications of PEC systems. Recently, Yao et al.12 classified light absorbers as unstable PV grade (c-Si, a-Si, CIGS, III–V like InP, GaAs, etc.) or intrinsically stable non-PV grade (TiO2, WO3, Fe2O3, BiVO4, TaON, Ta3N5, etc.). PV grade materials require sophisticated protection strategies to achieve stability in the aqueous solution of the PEC cell, increasing the complexity (and thus the cost) of the devices. In addition to these well-known materials, intensive efforts have recently been made to find promising alternatives (e.g. oxynitrides,20 oxyhalides,21 and oxysulfides22) that show respectable inherent stability in water without sophisticated protection strategies.
In terms of the material stability of light absorbers in water, metal oxides are the most suitable. Most of them are also abundant and inexpensive; hence, they hold promise as practical photoelectrodes for PEC water splitting. On the other hand, they have extremely poor optoelectronic properties, yielding low STH efficiencies. However, intensive research in the past 20 years has found strategies to improve these properties to achieve respectable STH efficiencies. In particular, the photocurrent densities of TiO2, WO3, and BiVO4 have already come very close to reaching their theoretical values, and many relatively new materials are also achieving rapid progress.3,23 The developments in metal oxide-based photoelectrodes were discussed in some recent reviews.3,10,15 However, we found that discussion of ferrite materials as light absorbers in PEC cells is surprisingly rare. Thus, the present review article focusses on ferrites as photoelectrodes for PEC water splitting to produce solar hydrogen.
Ferrite (iron-containing metal oxide) is one of the most earth-abundant minerals; it is usually synthesized from binary metal oxide Fe2O3 (hematite). Hematite has been studied for almost two decades, and its PEC water splitting performance has improved to an impressive 3.0 to 4.5 mA cm−2 @ 1.23 VRHE under 1 sun irradiation (100 mW cm−2) in alkaline media when synthesized in the form of a mesoporous film24 or 1D nanorod structure25 by ambient pressure chemical vapor deposition (APCVD)26 or polymer-assisted decomposition deposition.27 The ferrites inherit most of the properties of hematite but are much less studied; hence, they may have more room for further development. In this review, we discuss diverse aspects of n-type and p-type ferrites, including basic optoelectronic properties such as their band gap energy, absorption coefficient, and electronic structure, together with the performance of PEC overall water splitting under illumination. We summarize the current technical status and provide a future perspective of ferrite-based photoelectrodes for PEC solar water splitting.
2. Photoelectrochemical water splitting with ferrites as photoelectrode materials
2.1 Principle of photoelectrochemical cells
A PEC cell has a similar configuration to a water electrolyzer except that it is powered by solar energy harvested by a photoelectrode instead of by externally supplied electricity. As schematically shown in Fig. 3, the common geometry of a photoelectrode is composed of:
 Fig. 3  Geometry of a typical photoanode. Examples of model photoanodes include FTO/Ti:Fe2O3/TiO2/NiFeOx (ref. 27) and FTO/SiO2/Si:Fe2O3/Al2O3/NiFeOx (ref. 29). 
(1) A substrate or charge collector (e.g. ITO, FTO, Mo, Ti or wafers)
(2) A light absorber (usually, several 100 to 1000 nm thick or thicker)
(3) A protection layer and charge collector
(4) A catalytic layer (electrocatalyst)
Usually, the light absorber and substrate represent the majority of the volume and cost of the device.3,28 Thus, usage of a ferrite as the light absorber would greatly reduce the overall price of the photoelectrode. As mentioned, some materials require a protection layer for extended operation.19
Like many solar energy conversion devices, a PEC cell achieves high efficiency by charge separation through forming a semiconductor–liquid (electrolyte) junction (SCLJ), as depicted in Fig. 4.30–35 Under illumination, photon absorption by the semiconductor generates excited electron-and-hole pairs on a time scale of femtoseconds (fs) for hematite (step ① in Fig. 4). The photons with energies exceeding the semiconductor bandgap (Eg) are also absorbed and rapidly thermalize (usually within picoseconds, ps) to the energy level of the conduction band (CB). However, this more energetically potent charge carrier has a higher chance to be transferred and separated by providing more energy to the lattice.36 For this reason, photons of different energies form charge carriers with different carrier lifetimes.
 Fig. 4  A semiconductor–electrolyte junction under light illumination. Upon light illumination, the quasi-Fermi-level splits due to the excess concentration of photogenerated electron–hole pairs. Thus, the photovoltage (Vph) of the photoanode is determined by the difference of these two quasi-Fermi levels (Ef,n − Ef,p). The n-type metal oxide semiconductors like Fe2O3 (ref. 30) and BiVO4 (ref. 31) have this type of energy diagram, with a minority diffusion length (Lp) and depletion width (Lsc, often denoted as WD) of several nm.

Light absorption: SC + hv (≥Eg) → ecb− + hvb+(1)
When the excited electrons and holes are located at the CBM and VBM, respectively, they migrate from the bulk to the interface or recombine in the bulk, the proportion of which depends on the semiconductor properties. The time scale of this bulk transport is ∼ps to ∼ns. At this point, excited electrons and holes are often called majority and minority charge carriers for n-type semiconductors.
In a photoanode, the minority charge carrier (hole) carries out water oxidation to produce oxygen and protons, which is the slow step of the overall water splitting. It was recently shown that hematite follows a third order reaction mechanism in the surface hole density, which is assigned to equilibration between three surface holes and M(OH)–O–M(OH) sites.37 It was also noted that metal oxides showed transient hole transfer orders from 1 to 3 at a certain hole concentration (e.g. ∼1 hole per nm2 of the semiconductor surface) and that a material with a greater VBM energy level (WO3 > TiO2 > BiVO4 > Fe2O3) shows an earlier transition, i.e. a lower hole concentration is needed to initiate oxidation reaction via the hole. Thus, the VBM potential has a dominant effect on the efficient hole transfer of those metal oxides. As we discuss later, many ferrite materials have relatively low potentials; thus, the driving force for the charge transfer is weak. The time scale for this semiconductor‖electrolyte interface reaction ranges from the millisecond (ms) to even the second time scale. For instance, the time scales of charge transfer for BiVO4 are fs – ns for the bulk and μs – s for the surface,31 similar to those for Fe2O3.30
The above three steps of charge transfer take place in series on different time scales, and the current density (J) that survives each step and is eventually used for the PEC reaction can be quantified by the charge separation efficiencies:33,38,39 J = J0 × ηabs × ηbulk × ηsurf(2)where ηabs, ηbulk, and ηsurf denote the efficiencies for light absorption, bulk charge separation, and surface charge separation/injection, respectively. In general, ηbulk associated with step ② in Fig. 4 is the major bottleneck for metal oxide-based photoelectrodes. The charge separation efficiencies can be easily determined by comparing the photo-oxidation of highly reactive species (hole scavengers) such as H2O2 or sulphite ion with that of water.39 The ηbulk can also be calculated by the traditional Gärtner model:39,40 (3)
The absorption coefficient (α; thus, 1/α is depth that the photon can penetrate into the semiconductor), depletion width (W, several nm, where charge transport occurs via drift in the built-in electric field), diffusion length (Lp for a minority charge carrier for n-type) are crucial parameters to describe the charge transfer efficiency of a semiconductor.
Obviously, a larger W and longer Lp grant a higher ηbulk value. One thing to note is that distance that the charge travels is the sum of Lp and W for the bulk, which includes the region in which charge transport occurs via diffusion. The width of the depletion layer (W) is proportional to the applied bias: (4)where V = the applied bias (V), ε0 = the vacuum permittivity (8.854 × 10−12 F m−1), εr = the dielectric constant of the semiconductor (e.g. 68 for BiVO4,39 80 for Fe2O3 (ref. 41)), Efb = the flat band potential where hole transfer at the surface is about to occur, similar to the open circuit potential for a PV cell, q = electron charge (1.60217662 × 10−19 coulombs per electron), and ND = donor density (approximately the same as the total electron density, ∼1020 cm3 for undoped BiVO4). The usual values of W are several nm for metal oxide semiconductors.24,42
Another crucial parameter is the diffusion length, L (both Lp and Ln for holes and electrons, respectively), which can be expressed as:32 (5)D is the minority carrier diffusion coefficient and τ is its lifetime, which is related to the hole mobility μp (cm2 V−1 s−1): (6)where mh is the effective mass of the hole while moving inside the semiconductor. Larger D and τ afford higher bulk charge separation efficiencies. These Lp and a values can be used to calculate the apparent quantum yield or incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) of a semiconductor.43 Comparing the usual metrics known for metal oxide-based semiconductors (mobility μp = 0.05–1.0 cm2 V−1 s−1; diffusion length Lp = 1–100 nm)44 with those for PV grade materials (μp = 100–8000 cm2 V−1 s−1; Lp = 100 nm–10 μm), one can easily say that metal oxide-based light absorbers in general have very poor optoelectronic properties.12,30
The electronic conductivity (δ) is also an important property of a photoelectrode:43 δ = nqμn(7)where n is the charge carrier concentration (typically 1015 to 1023 cm−3 for metal oxides at ∼300 K by Hall measurements). The δ depends on the temperature as well as the charge hopping energy:43 (8)where ρ = the resistivity, ρ0 = the prefactor, (Ea − t) = the sum of the activation energy for polaron hopping of electrons, and t = the transfer integral at the coincidence configuration. A lower (Ea − t) value is favoured for higher ρ for semiconductors.
Recent studies on transition metal oxide semiconductor photoelectrodes suggest that their charge carrier dynamics cannot be fully elucidated via the traditional Gärtner model. For example, Fe2O3 (ref. 36 and 45) and BiVO4 (ref. 46 and 47) are proven to follow the small polaron-based charge transfer mechanism in the bulk of the semiconductors. Fig. 5 depicts a simplified demonstration of the formation and hopping of a small polaron for an n-type metal oxide-based photoanode.45 The small polaron is formed in a semiconductor with strong electron-phonon coupling, which lowers the electron mobility (<1 cm2 V−1 s−1) and increases the effective mass of the electron. An electron excited in an n-type semiconductor is localized and trapped at the metal site, and the trapped electron can move via hopping from a metal polyhedron (e.g. FeO6) to another metal polyhedron when it has enough energy to cross (e.g. Ea − t) with the hopping rate expressed in the Arrhenius equation. The amounts of energy reported for BiVO4 (single crystal, 0.3% W-doped, small polaron formed at VO4)43 and Fe2O3 (epitaxially grown, 5% Ti-doped, small polaron formed at FeO6)48 are 300 meV and 116 meV, which can give a rough estimation for bare materials as well. Lowering this Eσ value is beneficial; this can be achieved by doping, such as in a Mo-doped BiVO4 film. We expect that ferrites will behave in a similar way to Fe2O3 due to a large contribution of Fe 3d at the CBM, although detailed studies on this aspect are not available for ferrite-based photoelectrodes.

Solar water splitting in a PEC cell can be expressed in two half reactions; the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the anode and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at the cathode:3,49,50
OER: 2H2O(l) → 4H+(aq) + O2(g) + 4e−; E = 1.23 V vs. RHE(9)
HER: 2H+(aq) + 2e− → H2(g); E = 0.0 V vs. RHE(10)
Overall water splitting: 2H2O(l) → 2H2(g) + O2(g)(11)E = 1.23 V, ΔG° = +238 kJ mol−1
Thus, the potential requirement for overall water splitting is only moderate and can be provided by visible light excitation in a light absorber; however, accomplishing the reaction requires substantial amounts of overpotential and voltage loss, as presented in Fig. 6. By using a photoanode for OER and a photocathode for HER, overall water splitting can proceed even with no external voltage if the photovoltage (Vph) acquired with the photoanode and photocathode is above 1.5–1.7 V.51,52 Thus, Vph should be greater than the sum of the potential requirements, including the theoretical potential needed to derive overall water splitting, E(H2O), and various overpotentials.12 Vph ≥ E(H2O) + ηOER + ηHER + ηothers(12)

A typical overpotential for OER (ηOER) is ∼300 mV for 10 mA per geometric cm2, and that for HER (ηHER) is ∼100 mV for 10 mA per geometric cm2; these account for approximately ∼24% of the total required potential.53 The solar-to-hydrogen (STH) conversion efficiency can be calculated by reading the Jop (operating point) of the whole system, as in Fig. 6:3,52 (13)where ηF is the faradaic efficiency of H2 production and Ptotal is the solar power input (∼100 mW cm−2 for AM 1.5G or 1 sun conditions).
2.2 Ferrites as photoelectrode materials
Hematite (Fe2O3) is a binary oxide photoanode material containing Fe that has been studied extensively over the years. It has many of the properties that are required for an ideal photoelectrode: earth-abundance, stability in basic electrolyte, and a small bandgap energy (∼2.1 eV) due to the d–d transition. However, its poor charge carrier dynamics due to a low polaron hopping rate and its dominant indirect bandgap leads to limited PEC performance.18 Thus, it is necessary to find materials with the advantages of Fe2O3 but with better optoelectronic properties. This hematite film is used as the reference photoelectrode to which the ferrite electrodes are compared throughout this review article (Fig. 7).

Samples synthesized by known protocols: ZnFe2O4 (solution-based hydrothermal method54), Fe2O3 (polymer-assisted decomposition deposition27), CuFeO2 (sol–gel55), LaFeO3 (polymer-assisted decomposition deposition56), BiFeO3 (sol–gel56), Fe2TiO5 (solvothermal method57) and (FeCrAl)2O3 (spin-coating58). 
The synthesis procedures and properties of the representative ferrites discussed in this article are summarized in Table 1. As iron-containing ternary metal oxides, ferrites allow band engineering by changing the type and the composition of the metal cation other than Fe. In the case of perovskite oxide (ABO3) and spinel-structured metal oxides (AB2O4), the bandgap energy is determined by the BO6 anion group. In general, ferrites with the FeO6 octahedral group have good chemical stability and narrow bandgap energies, which are also advantages of Fe2O3. Additionally, the band edges can be tuned by the metal cation in the ‘A’ site while maintaining similar band gap and stability.

Various characteristics of metals, such as electronegativity and size, contribute to the formation of the conduction band (CB) and valence band (VB) to affect the electronic properties. Because the ionization energy affects the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO), oxygen, which has relatively high electronegativity, generally forms the valence band. Because the electron affinity determines the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), the metal atoms with smaller electronegativity form a lower conduction band position.71 However, because the minority carrier of the photoanode is driven by the VB, it is important to control O 2p, which is the main energy state of the VB. The structure of the FeO6 group in ferrites can be tilted according to the size of the A site cations. The angle of Fe–O–Fe affects the charge of the O 2p state as well as the OER activity. Therefore, especially in perovskite materials, when the A site cations are reduced in size, the angle is reduced by less than 180 °C due to structural tilting, and the VBM is lowered.72 This tendency was observed in ZnFe2O4 and is considered to be the case for many other ferrites as well.
An effective synthesis method is the most important factor in the fabrication of an efficient photoelectrode; it determines the intrinsic semiconducting properties, such as defect states, electronic conductivity, and optical properties. Various methods have been studied for depositing different ferrite materials on substrates (mainly FTO), such as pulsed layer deposition (PLD),73 chemical vapour deposition (CVD),64,74,75 electrodeposition,55,76 and wet-chemical techniques, including hydrothermal and sol–gel processes.56,77,78 Therefore, it is necessary to select and develop a synthesis method that is well suited to the specific purpose and allows fine control.
Regardless of the synthesis temperature, post-synthetic high temperature annealing is usually required to obtain the high-quality crystalline ferrites required for high PEC performance. Most activated photoelectrodes are obtained at a temperature above 600 °C; however, higher temperature is not always desirable because it can damage the transparent conducting oxide (TCO) substrate, break the nanostructures, and change the crystal phase.79 However, for a CaFe2O4 photocathode, an annealing temperature above 1200 °C is required to create a photoactive material using a damage-free Pt substrate.63 A ZnFe2O4 photoanode annealed at 800 °C was not effective due to coalescence of its nanostructures; however, it showed a drastic increase in photoactivity through hybrid microwave annealing (HMA), which generates a local temperature over 1000 °C but does not damage the FTO substrate because of the extremely short treatment time.54
Two general issues in using ferrites as light absorbers are their indirect bandgap characteristics and poor charge carrier dynamics.13 For most ferrites, the transition of Fe 3d (CB) – Fe 3d with contribution of O 2p at the upper side of the VB gives an indirect bandgap, while the transition of Fe 3d – O 2p gives a direct bandgap. Contributions of other metals make only small changes in this direct/indirect bandgap; hence, hematite and ferrites share very similar optoelectronic properties. Thus, most ferrites do not absorb incident photons as much as their bandgap energy would allow due to indirect photon absorption. The absorption coefficient (α) of hematite drastically decreases toward the wavelength near the bandgap energy, although the α values differ somewhat depending on the synthesis method or conditions (103 to 105 cm−1).80–83 Similarly, most ferrite materials suffer from low absorption coefficients near their band gap energies due to the indirect Fe 3d–Fe 3d transition. For example, the absorption coefficient of ZnFe2O4 fabricated by a simple solution method is on the order of 104 cm−1, which corresponds to a penetration depth (α−1) of 550 nm.84 However, when Fe2O3 and ZnFe2O4 synthesized by the same method are compared, a thicker film is required for ZnFe2O4 to have Fe2O3-level absorbance; this indicates that ZnFe2O4 has a smaller α value (or a larger a−1).85 BiFeO3 shows rapid falloff of α to ∼0.25 × 105 cm−1 near the 550–600 nm wavelength region.86,87 CuFeO2 shows α of ∼105 cm−1 at 600 nm, which decreases to ∼0.5 × 105 cm−1 near the indirect bandgap energy (1.43 to 1.55 eV). These absorption coefficients of ferrites are much smaller than those of III–V semiconductors such as InP and GaAs;12 therefore, a much thicker film is required to achieve the same light harvesting. In the thicker light absorber, the charge carriers must travel a longer distance and have a higher chance to recombine in the bulk, resulting in a low absorbed-photon-to-current efficiency (APCE).
As mentioned, the charge carrier dynamics of ferrites are closely related to their bulk charge transport through small polaron hopping, as reported for ZnFe2O4, MgFe2O4, CuFeO2, and LaFeO3.66,67,73 When polaronic transport governs the bulk conduction mechanism, photo-excited charge carriers need extra phonon motions to transfer between atoms.36 However, near the absorption edge, additional phonon energy is not available, which causes recombination of charge carriers before hopping. In addition, the absorption band edge of ferrites is generally due to the indirect Fe 3d → Fe 3d optical transition, which is inefficient in generating mobile charge carriers. To overcome these inferior bulk properties, several strategies have been introduced, such as nanostructuring,54 heterojunctions,88 and doping.66 The detailed bulk properties (e.g. charge carrier mobility, lifetime, and diffusion length) of each material are discussed in Section 3.
Compared to the poor charge transport properties in the bulk, those on the surface are more reasonable. Commonly, ferrite photoelectrodes have superior photostability. Most of them can promote OER or HER for a long time without a protection layer. In the case of photoanodes, ηsurf can be near 100% when the surface states are properly passivated by an oxygen evolution cocatalyst (OEC).89 However, in the case of photocathodes, the surface is poorly catalytic for HER. Even though there are several reports of producing hydrogen by applying a hydrogen evolution cocatalyst (HEC), the photocurrent-to-hydrogen conversion efficiencies are generally lower than those of photoanodes.79,90 Further advances are needed in order to enhance the performance of ferrite photocathodes.
In summary, ferrites have poor optoelectronic properties in comparison to well-known PV-grade light absorbers as well as some metal oxides. Specifically, GaAs (Eg = 1.4 eV), known as a top tier semiconductor, has α = 22 × 104 cm−1 at 420 nm,91Lp = ∼900 nm, and μn = 8500 cm2 V−1 s−1.12 Even a metal oxide, BiVO4 (Eg = 1.4 eV) has α = 10 × 104 cm−1 at 420 nm,92Lp = ∼70 nm, and μn = 0.02–0.044 cm2 V−1 s−1.93 In contrast, the most studied ferrite, ZnFe2O4, has α = 1 × 104 at 420 nm; its Lp is not yet reported but is expected to be similar to that of Fe2O3, around 5 nm, and μn = 2.87 × 10−8 cm2 V−1 s−1. However, these PV grade light absorbers (GaAs, InP, c-Si, CIGS, CdTe, etc.12) have inherently poor stability in water and thus require protection by a solid state junction to function in aqueous electrolyte. Thus, the geometry of the photoelectrode becomes extremely complex, such as light absorber/buffer/protection layer/electrocatalyst.19 In the case of ferrites, the typical configuration would be light absorber/passivation layer/electrocatalyst; this has 1 or 2 fewer layers, so it is less complex and less expensive. Moreover, the majority of solid state junctions are formed by sophisticated methods such as ALD, PLD and sputtering, while ferrite-based photoelectrodes can be fabricated with simple solution-based methods; thus, they are even more cost-competitive.
3. Promising ferrite-based photoanodes
3.1 Zinc ferrite (ZnFe2O4)
Spinel ZnFe2O4 (franklinite) is a representative ferrite material that is the most investigated ferrite in photoanodes. Prototypical zinc ferrite has the AB2O4 structure, where O2− are arranged in a face-centred cubic (fcc) lattice, Zn2+ and Fe3+ are located in tetrahedral A (AO4) and octahedral B (BO6) sites, respectively, and the lattice parameters of the cubic structure (Fdm space group) are a = b = c ≈ 0.84 nm.94,95 However, the spinel structure allows various arrangements of tetrahedral and octahedral sites depending on the synthesis method.84,96,97 Thus, the spinel ZnFe2O4 structure can be represented by [Zn1−δFeδ]A[ZnδFe2−δ]BO4, where δ is the inversion degree ranging from normal spinel (δ = 0) to inverse spinel (δ = 1) (Fig. 8). Inverse spinel is the state in which octahedral Fe3+ is fully substituted into tetrahedral Zn2+, and the structural, optical, and magnetic properties vary with the inversion degree.98–102 Recently, it was also suggested by Sivula et al.84 that the formation of structural disorder by controlling the spinel inversion degree changes the PEC properties as well.

Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal the electronic structure of ZnFe2O4. Generally, the lower energy state constituting the valence band is composed of hybridized O 2p and Fe 3d orbitals, whereas the higher energy state composing the conduction band is mainly derived from Fe 3d orbitals. As a photoanode material, ZnFe2O4 has relatively narrow bandgaps: a direct bandgap of 2.4–2.68 eV (O2− 2p → Fe3+ 3d) and an indirect bandgap of 1.9–2.1 eV (spin-forbidden Fe3+ 3d → Fe3+ 3d).54,60,85,104,105 The optical absorption near the band edge follows the equation αhv = A(hv − Eg)n(14)where A is a scaling constant, α is the absorption coefficient, and n is the transition type number (n = 1/2 for direct transition allowed, 3/2 for direct transition forbidden, and 2 for indirect transition allowed for excited electrons).106
As shown in Fig. 9a, Fe2O3 and ZnFe2O4 have similar indirect bandgaps; however, the direct bandgap of ZnFe2O4 is 0.5 eV wider than that of Fe2O3. Therefore, the absorption ability is dominated by the direct bandgap, which has a higher absorption coefficient than the indirect band gap. This can also explain the more rapidly decreasing absorption of the ferrite as the wavelength increases, as shown in Fig. 9b.54,85 Theoretically, ZnFe2O4 with a bandgap energy of 2.0 eV can utilise solar light up to ∼620 nm wavelength, which gives a theoretical STH conversion efficiency of 17.9%. Although the hole diffusion length (LP) of ZnFe2O4 has not yet been reported, it is expected to be very short because a thinner ZnFe2O4 electrode produces a higher photocurrent density.85 Also, its electron mobility of ZnFe2O4 (2.87 × 10−8 cm2 V−1 s−1)107 is low compared to those of other metal oxides (0.044–10 cm2 V−1 s−1).44,108 These factors limit the performance of ZnFe2O4 photoanodes, which deviate greatly from their theoretical efficiencies. Like most ferrites, ZnFe2O4 is chemically and thermally stable in both alkaline and near neutral electrolytes, as corroborated by its Pourbaix diagram.109–111 The air-stability of ZnFe2O4 is also excellent; therefore, it is easy to handle and treat in air.

ZnFe2O4 was first introduced as a photoanode in 1985 by De Haart et al.112 The material was synthesized by a solid-state reaction, followed by pelletisation to form an electrode. Annealing the pellet at 700 °C in N2 atmosphere endowed it with n-type conductivity. The photocurrent density measured under irradiation of 300 nm light was 0.01 mA cm−2 at 1.23 VRHE in NaOH electrolyte (pH 14). Since then, Tahir et al.75,113 reported ZnFe2O4 electrodes prepared by aerosol-assisted chemical vapour deposition (AACVD) using a single source bimetallic precursor of [Fe2(acac)4(dmaeH)2][ZnCl4] with an alcoholic solvent. With the optimized conditions of deposition at 450 °C in 0.1 M ethanol for 35 min, a photocurrent density of 0.35 mA cm−2 and 10% incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) at 400 nm at 1.23 VRHE were obtained. As the ratio of ethanol increased in the mixed solvent of ethanol and methanol in the AAVCD process, ZnFe2O4 was transformed from hexagonal particles (∼500 nm) to nanorods (∼100 nm), resulting in smaller particle sizes. Therefore, the photocurrent density increased from 0.1 mA cm−2 (large particles) to 0.3 mA cm−2 (nanorods) at 1.23 VRHE.
A facile but effective method to fabricate ZnFe2O4/FTO was developed by converting a β-FeOOH/FTO precursor by drop-casting of Zn solution.54 The method was inspired by conversion of Fe2O3 into an Fe2O3/ZnFe2O4 core–shell composite.114 Using a copious amount of Zn source, the nanostructured β-FeOOH precursor was fully converted to ZnFe2O4 without leaving a significant amount of Fe2O3. Growth of β-FeOOH using a water-soluble iron salt (e.g. FeCl3·6H2O) and conversion via precipitation in mild heating conditions (60–100 °C) is often used to prepare high quality Fe2O3 nanorods that are suitable for fabricating photoanodes.115,116 This synthetic strategy for forming highly porous and ordered nano and microstructures of Fe2O3 with anisotropic charge transfer41 can also be used for ZnFe2O4 synthesis. The compatibility and adhesion between the substrate and the 1-D nanorods were very good because they were grown directly on FTO glass.
Conversion of FeOOH to ZnFe2O4 was proposed to proceed via the following reactions:89 2FeOOH → Fe2O3 + H2O (at ambient conditions)(15) 2Zn(NO3)2 → 2ZnO + 2N2 + 5O2(16) Fe2O3 + ZnO → ZnFe2O4(17)
After annealing of β-FeOOH at 550 °C or 800 °C with a Zn solution, the excess ZnO layer on the surface was removed by 1 M NaOH solution to obtain a pure ZnFe2O4 film. The fabrication process of this ZnFe2O4/FTO photoanode is illustrated in Fig. 10. A topotactic phase transformation occurred from β-FeOOH to α-Fe2O3 and to ZnFe2O4, while the highly porous and ordered 1-D structured morphology remained intact throughout the transformation. The 1-D morphology could provide improved charge transport and better light harvesting than conventional ZnFe2O4, which possesses an irregular particulate morphology. Indeed, the 1-D ZnFe2O4 film produced by this method showed higher PEC performance.59,84 The ZnFe2O4 nanorod films generally showed higher photocurrent density under illumination from the back (substrate) side than that from the front (electrolyte) side because of their poor bulk charge transport properties. However, this was solved by a TiO2 underlayer, which suppressed electron back injection.59 This material is also amenable to various modification strategies, such as heterojunction formation and extrinsic/intrinsic doping.

A new heating method, hybrid microwave annealing (HMA), was introduced by Lee and co-workers for post-treatment of ZnFe2O4.54 As-prepared ZnFe2O4 by conventional thermal annealing (CTA) at 550 °C and 800 °C exhibited photocurrent densities of 0.015 and 0.025 mA cm−2 at 1.23 VRHE, respectively, under 1 sun irradiation. Post-HMA treatment of these electrodes increased the photocurrent density by about 16 times, affording 0.24 mA cm−2 under the same conditions (Fig. 11a). The HMA treatment improved both the bulk charge separation efficiency (ηbulk) and the interfacial charge separation efficiency (ηsurf). The increase in ηbulk was modest, from ∼3% to 8%, due to the increased crystallinity of ZnFe2O4 as confirmed by the reduced full width at half maximum (FWHM) of its diffraction peaks. Dramatic improvement was observed in ηsurf from 10% to 80%, indicating that the surface defect sites were passivated to suppress the surface charge recombination by HMA treatment.

(c) Scheme of the HMA process. (d) The heat transfer mechanisms of CTA and HMA. Reproduced from ref. 117 with permission from the American Chemical Society, copyright 2018. 
The effects of HMA in comparison with CTA were further studied by extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) and intensity-modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS).117 The morphology of HMA-treated ZnFe2O4 did not change much from that of the β-FeOOH precursor. However, CTA at 800 °C for 20 min showed many surface grain boundaries, which acted as defect sites (Fig. 11b). The better structural ordering of HMA was confirmed by the lower Debye–Waller factor obtained from Fe K-edge EXAFS fitting. IMPS analysis showed the rate constants of the first-order charge transfer (ktr) and surface recombination (krec). The ktr values of HMA- and CTA-treated ZnFe2O4 were comparable with each other; however, the krec of HMA-treated ZnFe2O4 was smaller over the whole applied potential region (0.7 to 1.5 VRHE). This indicates that HMA treatment is more effective for suppressing charge recombination.
The remarkable effect of HMA, which is clearly distinct from that of CTA, arises from its different heating mechanism. The process and principle of HMA treatment are illustrated in Fig. 11c and d. In the case of CTA in a muffle furnace, thermal energy is transferred from the surface to the inner side of the material, generating a temperature gradient with Ti (inner temperature) lower than Ts (surface temperature). HMA is a process that combines direct microwave heating with additional heating from an effective microwave absorber, called a susceptor, that readily absorbs microwaves and turns itself into an additional heat source. Metal oxides such as ZnFe2O4 do not absorb microwaves efficiently due to their poor absorption characteristics at room temperature. However, once ZnFe2O4 is pre-heated by the susceptor above its critical temperature, it becomes a good microwave absorber due to its changed dielectric properties and attenuation distance at high temperature to achieve self-heating. Thus, HMA heats the material from the inside of ZnFe2O4, creating an inverse temperature gradient (Ti > Ts). Thus, HMA heats ceramic materials to a very high temperature in an extremely short time (a few minutes); this suppresses material sintering and substrate damage, leading to dramatically improved PEC performance of ZnFe2O4/FTO photoanodes.
Another effective post-treatment is the formation of oxygen vacancies by heating in hydrogen, vacuum or argon conditions.118 The hydrogen treatment is more effective than other treatments, as hydrogen reacts readily with the lattice oxygen of ZnFe2O4 to remove it as water molecules. The formation of oxygen vacancies was confirmed by observing the O2− vacancies in the O 1s peaks by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The oxygen vacancies acted as electron donors to enhance the charge separation efficiencies from 2% to 8% in the bulk (ηbulk) and from 35% to 90% on the surface (ηsurf) of the ZnFe2O4/FTO photoanode. Thus, hydrogen-treated ZnFe2O4 showed 0.32 mA cm−2 at 1.23 VRHE without the aid of any oxygen evolution catalyst (OEC) and 3 h of stability under simulated 1 sun conditions.
Finally, HMA treatment was used as a synthesis process for ZnFe2O4 (not just for post treatment) in combination with other modification strategies, including hydrogen treatment.59 HMA-treated ZnFe2O4 showed better ordering in its structure and undistorted Fe–O bonding in the FeO6 octahedron, as indicated by the decreased Debye–Waller factor. In addition to its high crystallinity compared to ZnFe2O4 thermally annealed at 800 °C, Sn diffusion from FTO glass did not occur; thus, the FTO substrate was not damaged physically and did not lose conductivity. Also, HMA formed smaller diameter (∼60 nm) ZnFe2O4 nanorods than CTA-ZnFe2O4 (∼80 nm). Therefore, the photocurrent density of ZnFe2O4 at 1.23 VRHE increased about 4 times from CTA (0.025 mA cm−2) to HMA (0.1 mA cm−2) under 1 sun conditions. Before growing β-FeOOH, 2–7 nm of TiO2 was spin-coated with Ti(IV) diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) solution on FTO. The major role of the TiO2 underlayer (electron transfer layer, ETL) was to suppress the back injection of electrons through the FTO substrate to the electrolyte, as indicated by the decreased dark currents and anodic onset potential shift. The other role is to act as a source of n-type dopant (Ti4+) to Increase n-type conductivity. However, the most significant improvement in PEC performance occurred with the hydrogen treatment. The photocurrent density of ZnFe2O4/TiO2/FTO increased from 0.22 mA cm−2 to 0.79 mA cm−2 at 1.23 VRHE after the hydrogen treatment. Fig. 12a–c shows that the hydrogen treatment increased ηbulk from 10% to 24% and ηsurf from 40% to 78% at 1.23 VRHE, accompanied with the largest increment in IPCE in the visible light region. Finally, deposition of NiFeOx on the hydrogen-treated ZnFe2O4/TiO2/FTO electrode as an oxygen evolution co-catalyst (OEC) showed a photocurrent density of water oxidation of 0.92 mA cm−2 at 1.23 VRHE, with a rise in ηsurf to 85% (Fig. 12d). The effects of the multiple modifications are illustrated in Fig. 12e.

Sivula and coworkers studied the effects of NiFeOx OEC on ZnFe2O4 nanorods in detail.60 As shown in Fig. 13, ZnFe2O4 is the most efficient material among the tested spinel ferrites (ZnFe2O4, MgFe2O4, CuFe2O4) as a photoanode for water oxidation. The electrode was prepared by the simple solution method reported by Kim et al.,54 treated with hydrogen, and then loaded with NiFeOx. Its onset potential and photocurrent density were ∼0.7 VRHE and 0.35 mA cm−2 at 1.23 VRHE, respectively. The most significant improvement was achieved by hydrogen treatment, from 0.02 mA cm−2 to 0.18 mA cm−2 at 1.23 VRHE. However, the onset potential was low compared to the flat band potential (0.53 VRHE) as determined by the Butler plot using the J–V curve of H2O2 oxidation because Fermi level pinning occurred at ∼0.9 VRHE due to the surface states. Therefore, rapid scan voltammetry (RSV) was conducted to elucidate the role of the NiFeOx on the surface. In RSV, the sample is photoelectrochemically oxidized to accumulate holes in the trap sites and subsequently reduced by filling the holes with electrons with a rapid scan. This enables current density measurements despite very small concentrations of surface species, and the results are extracted as capacitance. As a result, a notable increment of capacitance was detected after deposition of NiFeOx; this was caused by accumulation of holes in the intermediates rather than in the surface states, which caused Fermi level pinning. This represents a critical role of NiFeOx as a water oxidation co-catalyst.

A correlation between the spinel inversion degree (δ) and PEC performance was first suggested by Sivula's group.84 As mentioned, spinel ZnFe2O4 has various structures of normal spinel, where all the Zn2+ is located in tetrahedral (Td) sites and all the Fe3+ is on the octahedral (Oh) sites, and inverse spinel, where Fe3+ and Zn2+ exchange their locations. Thus, δ is defined as the fraction of substituted Fe3+ in the Td sites and is calculated by Rietveld refinement of the X-ray diffraction results. The δ value decreased from 0.3 to 0.13 as the synthesis temperature increased from 500 °C to 800 °C. All the electrodes underwent hydrogen treatment to finish the fabrication process. An interesting finding was that ZnFe2O4, with higher δ, showed higher ηbulk but lower ηsurf. ZnFe2O4 annealed at 600 °C with δ = 0.18 showed the highest photocurrent density of 0.8 mA cm−2 at 1.23 VRHE. However, its ηbulk (17%) was lower than that of ZnFe2O4 annealed at 500 °C (30%) and its ηsurf (56%) was lower than that of ZnFe2O4 annealed at 800 °C (85%). It was suggested that the higher δ is related to the superior charge transport and that changes in δ result in changes in the electronic structure. This structural disorder occurring in Fe (Td)–O–Fe (Oh) has the possibility to narrow the electronic bands near the Fermi level to assist charge transport via a hopping mechanism because the conductivity is likely to depend on the small polaron hopping rate.119 Finally, after deposition of NiFeOx, the photoanode gave a photocurrent density of 1.0 mA cm−2 at 1.23 VRHE, which is the highest obtained from ZnFe2O4 as a single light absorber for PEC water oxidation. Thus, this study proposed that the structural disorder induced by changing δ reduces the polaron hopping rate and improves the charge transport, thereby contributing to the improved PEC properties of ZnFe2O4. The importance of the small polaron hopping rate in ZnFe2O4 was recently studied by Henning et al.73 To reveal the transport mechanism of ZnFe2O4, magneto-transport and Hall measurements were performed with an electrode synthesized by pulsed laser deposition (PLD) to remove the influence of nanostructures. Disorder occurred in the ZnFe2O4 as δ changed, and the charge compensation formed Fe2+ at the Oh sites by charging Fe3+via electron hopping. The results confirmed that the charge transport properties were governed by the slow rate of small polaron hopping of the electrons between Fe2+ and Fe3+ in the octahedral sites.
Doping by introducing extrinsic defects in ZnFe2O4 was conducted to create additional charge carriers, the density of which can be calculated from the Mott–Schottky plot. (18)where C = the capacitance of the photoanode (metal oxide + electrolyte double layer, etc.), e = the charge of the electron, ε = the dielectric constant of the semiconductor, ε0 = the permittivity of vacuum, V = the applied bias (vs. RHE), Efb = the flat band potential (vs. RHE), k = the Boltzmann constant, ND = the donor density of the n-type semiconductor (cm−3), A = the surface area of the photoanode, and T = temperature (K). Introducing tetravalent cationic extrinsic dopants into Fe3+ sites increases the donor density (ND) to improve the n-type conductivity. One of the most important things to be considered in the study of dopants is to verify whether the dopants are substituted into the intended location of the crystal lattice.
Ti-doping into ZnFe2O4 was conducted via spray pyrolysis using a Zn–(Fe + 6% Ti) solution.120 The Ti-doping reduced the mean grain size of ZnFe2O4 from 50 nm to 42 nm, indicating that it affected the crystal growth mechanism. XPS showed that the binding energy of Ti 2p3/2 in Ti-doped ZnFe2O4 (457.92 eV) was lower than that of pure TiO2 (458.5 eV), suggesting that Ti was doped into ZnFe2O4 and replaced Fe3+. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy showed that the vibration peak of Zn–O remained unchanged even after Ti doping, whereas the Oh site of the Fe–O vibrational peak shifted toward higher wavelengths; this indicated again that Ti4+ replaced Fe3+ in the Oh sites. The photocurrent density improved from 0.05 mA cm−2 to 0.35 mA cm−2 at 1.23 VRHE upon incorporation of 6% Ti into ZnFe2O4.
Recently, dual doping of Cu and Sn into ZnFe2O4 nanorods was reported; the material was synthesized through a simple solution-based method with mixed Zn and Fe precursors before growing β-FeOOH. Cu doping was conducted by dip coating to substitute Zn2+ in the tetrahedral sites. Because Cu2+ was incorporated from the surface to the inner side, Cu doping increased the band bending region with gradient doping and improved the charge separation efficiency of ZnFe2O4 along the radial direction. Subsequently, Sn doping occurred through Sn diffusion from FTO with high temperature annealing at 750 °C. Therefore, Sn4+ was detected gradually from the bottom to the top along the vertical direction. This dual doping reduced the surface trap states and accelerated the charge separation further. As a result, ηbulk increased from 3% to 17.5% and ηsurf increased from 14.6% to 55.2%, reaching 0.46 mA cm−2 at 1.23 VRHE without any OEC.
When FTO glass is used as the substrate for a photoanode, Sn diffusion from the substrate to the material always occurs during high temperature annealing.117,121,122 This unintentional Sn doping is commonly used as a beneficial side effect in the process of increasing crystallinity or as a source of co-doping with other extrinsic dopants.121–123 However, this extraction of Sn causes damage to the FTO glass, and it is impossible to control the doped Sn content. Kim et al.89 reported intentional extrinsic doping into ZnFe2O4 with Ti or Sn dopants. They synthesized ZnFe2O4 nanorods with a solution method;54 the precursors of Ti and Sn were mixed with the Zn precursor solution before the solution was dropped on β-FeOOH film. However, XPS showed that Ti4+ and Sn4+ exist as dopant states in the bulk of ZnFe2O4, whereas TiO2 and SnO2 were formed on its surface. It was proposed that the diffusion of Zn2+, Ti4+ and Sn4+ interfered with each other, causing unintended TiO2 and SnO2 formation. Interestingly, the remaining metal oxide layers (1–2 nm) acted as a passivation layer in 800 °C-annealed ZnFe2O4; the layer could cover surface defect sites to improve the surface charge separation, resulting in higher ηsurf. Also, due to passivation effects, a high photovoltage of 0.43 VRHE was obtained. Therefore, 2% Ti-doped ZnFe2O4 annealed at 800 °C with NiFeOx OEC produced a photocurrent density of 0.31 mA cm−2 at 1.23 VRHE, showing ηsurf of ∼100%. However, increment of ηbulk due to the doping was more dominant in lower temperature-annealed (550 °C) ZnFe2O4. It increased from 5.3% for bare ZnFe2O4 to 10% and 11% for Ti 2% and Sn 3%-doped ZnFe2O4, respectively, while it remained below 8% in the 800 °C-annealed material. These results indicate that doping at lower temperature is more helpful than high temperature annealing in improving the conductivity of the material to promote bulk charge separation. Therefore, it was suggested that separating the doping process and the surface treatment covering the defect sites would maximize each effect.
The effects of the Al2O3 passivation layer on the ZnFe2O4 nanorods were also reported.124 In addition to annealing at 800 °C, the Al2O3 coating on the ZnFe2O4 film helped to minimize surface defects and reduced surface recombination due to the chemical passivation effect. A photocurrent density of 0.48 mA cm−2 was achieved after coating of Al2O3; this is higher than 0.067 mA cm−2 of 550 °C-annealed ZnFe2O4 and 0.16 mA cm−2 of 800 °C-annealed ZnFe2O4 at 1.23 VRHE.
The PEC properties of Fe2O3 and ZnFe2O4 were compared by Hufnagel et al.85 A thin (∼30 nm) ZnFe2O4 electrode was fabricated by sequential atomic layer deposition (ALD) of Fe2O3 and ZnO layers, followed by calcination at 600 °C. The donor density (ND) of ZnFe2O4 was 2 × 1017 cm−3 and the flat band potential (Efb) was 0.64 VRHE, while those of Fe2O3 were 7 × 1018 cm−3 and 0.75 VRHE, respectively. The more negative Efb and conduction band position of ZnFe2O4 allowed a lower onset potential than that of Fe2O3, as much as the difference in Efb of these two materials (Fig. 14a). Also, the width of the space charge layer for ZnFe2O4 (146 nm) was much larger than that for Fe2O3 (16 nm). Although ZnFe2O4 has a thicker space charge layer, providing a stronger driving force for exciton separation, the PEC water oxidation ability of ZnFe2O4 was much lower than that of Fe2O3. This result may be due to the short hole diffusion length in the bulk, as deduced by the higher photocurrent density in the thinner ZnFe2O4 (Fig. 14b). In addition, IMPS reveals the surface charge transfer properties in two ways: the rate constants for first-order charge transfer (ktr) and surface electron–hole recombination (krec). A small sinusoidal variation of the light intensity creates a modulated photocurrent, which is recorded at various frequencies. The results are presented in Nyquist plots. The normalized photocurrent densities at the high frequency intercept (HFI) and the low frequency intercept (LFI) correspond to interfacial charge transfer and hole transfer, respectively. (19)

The time constant, ω = ktr + krec, can be measured when the maximum phase shift is seen at the top of the semicircle in Nyquist plots. The calculated results show that the surface charge transfer of the two materials was comparable, while the rate of surface charge recombination in ZnFe2O4 was significantly lower than that of Fe2O3 (Fig. 14c–e). Therefore, to overcome the poor photon absorption as mentioned earlier and the short hole diffusion length of ZnFe2O4, nanostructuring, such as inverse opal, was conducted to enhance the absorbance and the photocurrent density from 0.05 mA cm−2 to 0.26 mA cm−2 at 1.23 VRHE. A similar trend of a lower photocurrent density for a thicker electrode was also seen in ZnFe2O4 synthesized by CVD.125 In this case, up to a certain thickness, backside illumination showed better performance because the light directly reached the FTO side and reduced the distance for the electrons to travel. In addition, to create a porous morphology, polymer templates were used in a simple dip-coating synthesis method.126
Although several strategies have been developed to enhance the photoactivity of ZnFe2O4, its performance is still far short of those of other long-studied metal oxide photoanodes, such as Fe2O3 or BiVO4, and is much poorer than its theoretical performance.23,41 Therefore, it is necessary to find a way to improve the poor absorption coefficient and bulk charge separation of ZnFe2O4, which are fundamental limitations of this compound. There is also a need to develop new synthesis methods that improve the intrinsic properties of ZnFe2O4 and new modification strategies to enhance its PEC performance in water oxidation.
3.2 Magnesium ferrite (MgFe2O4)
Ideally, MgFe2O4 has an inverse spinel structure with the cubic lattice of the Fdm space group, meaning that the tetrahedral (Td) sites are fully occupied by Fe atoms and the octahedral (Oh) sites by Mg and half Fe atoms.60,127–129 Like ZnFe2O4, the density of states (DOS) of MgFe2O4 indicates that the conduction bands are dominated by the Fe 3d states, and the valence bands are composed of mixed states of Fe 3d and O 2p.130 In view of its bandgap energies (2.4 eV for direct bandgap, 2.0 eV for indirect bandgap) and band positions, MgFe2O4 is capable of producing both hydrogen and oxygen.60,103 However, only a few studies have reported its application in photocatalytic H2 evolution;131,132 recently, MgFe2O4 has been studied mainly as a photoanode material.60,73
Sivula's group60 synthesized MgFe2O4 nanorods by the solution method used for ZnFe2O4 synthesis. A Mg precursor was dropped on β-FeOOH and annealed at 800 °C; the MgO remaining on the surface was removed by dissolving in 7 M HNO3 to obtain pure MgFe2O4. The Efb was measured to be 0.65 VRHE using the Butler method, and the photocurrent density increased to only 0.02 mA cm−2 from 0.004 mA cm−2 even after hydrogen treatment. The poor performance was due to the significantly low ηbulk of MgFe2O4 (1.7%) compared to that of ZnFe2O4 (11%).
Further study on MgFe2O4 thin films was conducted by Henning et al.73 Different from the case of ZnFe2O4, magneto-transport and Hall measurements on MgFe2O4 did not work because of its high resistance. The results indicate that substitution of Fe2+ of Oh sites by nonmagnetic Mg2+ interferes with small polaron hopping between Fe2+ and Fe3+, decreasing the itinerant t2g electrons. Although the Efb measured by the Mott–Schottky plot was 0.67 VRHE, similar to the above work, the photocurrent density was extremely low (0.026 mA cm−2 at 1.5 VRHE).
The structural and optical properties of MgFe2O4 were similar to that of ZnFe2O4. However, Mg2+ in the Oh sites caused high resistance and unstable polarization curves under illumination. The extremely low bulk charge separation efficiency of MgFe2O4 is a major bottleneck that must be overcome and improved. Therefore, controlling the synthesis temperature or introduction of appropriate dopants may be helpful to change the inversion degree and enhance the conductivity. Because not much research has yet been done on MgFe2O4, it is necessary to apply the strategies proven effective for other metal oxide photoanodes to increase its bulk charge separation efficiency.
3.3 Copper ferrite (CuFe2O4)
CuFe2O4 has a spinel structure; however, unlike ZnFe2O4 and MgFe2O4, it has two phases of tetragonal and cubic spinel.133 A symmetry transition of CuFe2O4 from tetragonal to cubic spinel phase occurs in the range of 400–800 °C.134,135 This wide temperature range is due to the different second-annealing and quenching temperatures as well as the synthesis conditions.136 When CuFe2O4 was synthesized by a solid-state reaction near 700–800 °C through second annealing, the phase transition occurred from 400 °C and the pure phase cubic structure could be seen at 500 °C (Fig. 15a).134 However, when it was annealed at 1000 °C, a higher second-annealing temperature of 700–800 °C and quick quenching step were needed to obtain cubic-structured CuFe2O4 (Fig. 15b).135 The body-centred tetragonal crystal system has a space group of I41/amd with a = b ≈ 0.82 nm and c ≈ 0.87 nm, which shows a tetragonal ratio (γ) = c/a ≈ 1.06 > 1. However, the parameters of cubic CuFe2O4 are the same as those of ZnFe2O4, indicating γ = 1. Phase transition occurs with the variation in the distance between the oxygen and cations in the octahedral (Oh) and tetrahedral (Td) sites. In cubic phase, the interatomic distances of Oh and Td are similar, whereas in tetragonal phase, Oh is elongated to the tetragonal axis (horizontal axis) and compressed with the perpendicular plane (vertical axis) with increasing temperature.134 Energetically, CuFe2O4 prefers an inverse spinel structure ([Fe]A[CuFe]BO4) at the ground state with the tetragonal phase (Fig. 15c).137 Therefore, when the second-annealing temperature increases, the inversion degree (δ) tends to decrease and the conductivity of CuFe2O4 increases as the phase changes from tetragonal to cubic symmetry.134,135 These results are well matched with the previously mentioned disordered ZnFe2O4, which showed lower δ under higher temperature annealing conditions.84

The measurements showed that CuFe2O4 had a direct bandgap of 1.9–2.1 eV and an indirect bandgap of 1.3 eV.60 The electronic structure from the DFT calculation revealed that the valence band is composed of hybridizations of the Cu 3d orbitals of the octahedral sites, Fe 3d orbitals of the tetrahedral sites, and O 2p orbitals, while the conduction band is composed of mixed Fe 3d and O 2p orbitals.135,137
Cubic CuFe2O4 was synthesized hydrothermally and deposited by doctor blading on a FTO glass to fabricate a photoelectrode.138 (5,10,15,20-Tetraphenyl)porphinato manganese(III) (MnTPP) was used as a photosensitizer to broaden the range of light absorption. The p-type conductivity of the material was confirmed by the negative slope of the Mott–Schottky plot with Efb of 0.14 VRHE. Recently, CuFe2O4 was synthesized by flame annealing, and its film was fabricated by a spin coating method.139 UV-vis spectroscopy and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) were used to investigate the bandgap energy and the valence band edge. The valence band maximum of the p-type CuFe2O4 was at 1.15 VRHE, which is lower than the water oxidation potential. The highest photocurrent density of −1.47 mA cm−2 at 0.4 VRHE and a high onset potential of 1.05 VRHE were observed when it was used as a photocathode for water reduction. In addition to using CuFe2O4 as a single light absorber based on its p-type conductivity, p–n heterojunctions with other photoanode materials were studied.140,141
Interestingly, CuFe2O4 has both p-type and n-type conductivity. Gómez et al.61 used commercial CuFe2O4 nanoparticles to fabricate an electrode on FTO through doctor blading and annealing at 450 °C. The as-prepared sample showed cubic CuFe2O4 with a direct bandgap of 2.1 eV (Fig. 16a). It showed a small anodic photocurrent density; however, p-type conductivity was clearly revealed by the negative slope of the Mott–Schottky plot, cathodic photocurrents and positive spikes, denoting accumulation of photogenerated electrons at the surface (Fig. 16b). A low photocurrent density of 0.04 mA cm−2 at 0.8 VRHE was observed in Ar-purged 1 M NaOH solution; however, the onset potential of 1.1 VRHE was high enough to enable unbiased water splitting by coupling with various photoanodes.

CuFe2O4 with n-type conductivity was synthesized by a simple solution method by Sivula's group.60 The Cu precursor was dropped on β-FeOOH and annealed at 800 °C to convert it to CuFe2O4. The crystal structure of CuFe2O4 prepared through this method was tetragonal spinel with a space group of I41/amd after post treatment at 550 °C, which corresponds to the abovementioned phase transition condition. Different from other n-type spinel ferrites, CuFe2O4 has a direct optical transition, as indicated by a sharp fall in absorbance around 600 nm (Fig. 17a and b). The CuFe2O4 photoanode showed 0.01 mA cm−2 and 0.3 mA cm−2 at 1.23 VRHE for H2O and H2O2 oxidation, respectively, under 1 sun irradiation. Like other ferrites, poor ηbulk (3%) of CuFe2O4 is a critical barrier that should be overcome to improve its photoactivity.

Reproduced from ref. 62 with permission from the Royal Society of Chemistry, copyright 2019. 
The intrinsic properties of CuFe2O4 were evaluated by various (photo)electrochemical analyses by Guijarro et al.62 The Mott–Schottky plots under dark conditions and illumination confirmed that CuFe2O4 has n-type conductivity and that sluggish band bending occurs from 1.3 to 1.5 VRHE. Therefore, in this voltage range, a potential drop occurs across the Helmholtz layer due to the Fermi level pinning, giving a depletion width (W) of ∼20 nm. In addition to the small W, the relatively positive flat band potential (Efb) of 0.78 VRHE limits the maximum photovoltage that can be induced from CuFe2O4. Through the surface state capacitance (CSS) from PEC impedance spectroscopy (PEIS), the density of surface states (DOS) can be shown with a Gaussian distribution as a function of CSS, which corresponds to the accumulated holes at the interface between the material and electrolyte. The fact that the DOS was located immediately after the onset potential suggests that the accumulated holes are intermediate species of the water oxidation reaction (Fig. 17c). According to IMPS, a notable photocurrent increment was observed at 1.3 VRHE, where ktr exceeded krec. Therefore, reducing the surface charge recombination will be helpful to increase the reaction rate. Intensity-modulated photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS) was used to determine the electron lifetime (τn ≈ 2.7 ms) and, subsequently, the diffusion coefficient (Dn ≈ 37.5 μm2 s−1) and diffusion length (Ln ≈ 318 nm) by the equation: τn = (2πfIMVS)−1(20)where fIMVS is the angular frequency at the minimal value of the IMVS Nyquist plot. These kinetic parameters are all modest; however, a more serious problem is the extremely short hole diffusion length (Lp ≈ 4 nm), which is similar to that of Fe2O3 and represents the general main limiting factor of iron-based metal oxides in achieving high PEC activity.
CuFe2O4 has cubic and tetragonal phases that can be controlled by post-heat treatment. Interestingly, p-type CuFe2O4 has a tendency toward a cubic structure, while n-type CuFe2O4 has a tetragonal structure. As with n-type CuFe2O4, the photoelectrochemical properties and limitations are similar to those of ZnFe2O4 and Fe2O3, such as short hole diffusion length and low bulk charge separation efficiency. Therefore, it is necessary to perform follow-up research of strategies to address these issues.
3.4 Bismuth ferrite (BiFeO3)
BiFeO3 is known widely as a ferroelectric or magnetism material142 rather than a light absorber used for PEC cells. The material itself is well studied, especially for ferroelectricity. While it has three phases (α, β, γ), the one most often discussed is the α phase, which has the hexagonal unit cell parameters of rhombohedral BiFeO3 (a = b = 5.57414 Å, c = 13.85882 Å) with coordination of FeO6 and BiO12.74 It is a perovskite (ABO3) metal oxide that undergoes spontaneous displacement from ideal cell parameters for both Fe and Bi, while the displacement is much larger for Bi (3 times) towards the c-axis (Fig. 18).143

As a metal oxide derived from Bi2O3 and Fe2O3, BiFeO3 can be fabricated by many methods, from simple solid state reactions to rather sophisticated methods.142,144 One should note that BiFeO3 is metastable at 700 °C to 800 °C, which is also the formation temperature of the material. The phase transitions take place from α to β and γ as the temperature increases and eventually to liquid Bi2O3 and Fe2O3 at temperatures above 1000 °C, as confirmed by differential thermal analysis (Fig. 19). This dilemma of similar formation and decomposition temperatures is the major difficulty in creating defect-controlled and highly crystalline BiFeO3 on a substrate. 2BiFeO3 → Bi2O3 + Fe2O3 (decomposition above 850 °C)(21)

At such a high temperature, most of the TCO (FTO) is not stable; thus, SrTiO3 with the same perovskite structure is often selected as the substrate for lattice matching and synthesis compatibility. Thus, BiFeO3 fabricated by pulsed laser deposition (PLD) on a (001)-oriented SrTiO3 substrate at 800 °C and an oxygen partial pressure of 200 mTorr showed direct (∼2.7 eV) and indirect (2.2 to 2.1 eV) bandgaps, which are very similar to those of Fe2O3.106 In addition to PLD, most fabrication methods (CVD, solution-based coating and hydrothermal) produce BiFeO3 with the aforementioned crystallography and strong indirect band gap characteristics.
It is difficult to find studies in the literature that have proven figures of merit of BiFeO3 as a photoelectrode for PEC cells, including polarization curves in electrolyte (I–V curves), IPCE, and gaseous product analysis, which are proof of PEC activity. One rare example to note is a study by Moniz et al.,74 who fabricated polycrystalline BiFeO3/FTO using aerosol-assisted CVD (AACVD) with a single-source heterobimetallic precursor [CpFe(CO)2BiCl2]. Their film showed an indirect band gap of ∼2.2 eV with Eflat band of 0.3 VRHE and Jph of ∼50 A cm−2 in Na2SO4 under simulated 1 sun conditions. They also conducted low-pressure CVD (LPCVD) using dual sources of Bi and Fe, i.e. bismuth(III)tertbutoxide (Bi(OtBu)3) and iron(III)tert-butoxide ([Fe(OtBu)3]2).64 Their elaborately optimized fabrication of BiFeO3 with temperatures of 475–575 °C and reactor oxygen partial pressures of 8–45 mbar indicated the difficulty of obtaining the photoactive state and phase of BiFeO3. Interphases of Bi25FeO40 and Bi2Fe4O9 were formed, and the ratio of Bi:Fe = 1:1 was difficult to achieve. Their BiFeO3/FTO fabricated at 525 °C or 550 °C showed a modest polarization curve for water oxidation, with IPCE of 23% at 400 nm (Fig. 20). The film showed photoactivity up to ∼550 nm; this confirms its indirect band gap of 2.2–2.3 eV.

The stability of BiFeO3 has been proven in both photocatalytic (with an electron scavenger, Na2S2O8) and PEC water oxidation conditions. In the case of the PEC cell, 4 h of stable O2 gas evolution was observed with a photoanode with the configuration of FTO/BiFeO3/Ni–Bi at an applied bias of 1.6 VRHE. Its performance of ∼0.4 mA cm−2 at 1.23 VRHE and Vph of almost 0.8 V in potassium borate buffer (pH 9.5) under simulated 1 sun illumination is modest; however, this represents the best efficiency reported for BiFeO3-based photoanodes to date (Fig. 21).

There are many reports that some BiFeO3-based photoelectrodes show p-type conductivity. The current understanding is that Bi defects create this p-type conductivity, suggesting that the synthetic conditions also play an important role in determining the conductivity type of BiFeO3. An interesting approach to fabricating BiFeO3–SrTiO3 solid solution (denoted as BFO:STO) was reported; the solution was used as a photocathode.65 As mentioned, SrTiO3 is a commonly used material as a particulate photocatalyst and as a substrate to fabricate ferroelectrics owing to its favorable lattice parameter matching with other perovskite metal oxides. For material preparation, the target ceramic was sintered using a solid state reaction at 800 °C, and BiFeO3 or BFO:STO solid solution films were grown on SrRuO3 (SRO)-buffered (001) STO substrates by PLD and annealing at 650 °C. As more SrTiO3 was introduced, the cell volume (62 Å to 59.5 Å) of the material as well as the band gap (from 2.7 eV to 3.2 eV for the direct band gap) shifted from those of pristine BiFeO3 to SrTiO3.
As shown in Fig. 22, the solid solution of BFO:STO greatly increased the p-type Jph of the material. With an optimum ratio of BFO:STO (75%:25%, denoted as 75–25), the STO/SRO/75–25 photocathode recorded Vph of 1.0 V and Jph around −0.3 mA cm−2 @ 1.23 VRHE. Pt deposition increased its Jph even further to −0.5 mA cm−2 @ 1.23 VRHE. Also, stoichiometric H2/O2 products were produced steadily from water splitting up to 12 h, showing good stability. In subsequent work by the same research group,145 the origin of the p-type conductivity was elucidated by the shallow defect (acceptor) sites near the CB. The presence of a Ti 3d level near Fe 3d at the CB enhanced the p-type conductivity and electron transfer towards the electrolyte.

Because BiFeO3 has ferroelectric and magnetic properties, the memory effect can also affect its PEC performance. Thus, BiFeO3 and its variants are so-called ferroelectric photovoltaics, which have ferroelectric or anti ferroelectric properties depending on how they are fabricated and whether they are polarized.146 Epitaxial BiFeO3 was fabricated on SRO/STO substrate at 680 °C and an oxygen pressure of 200 mTorr with preference for exposed facets of – (001), (110) and (111) towards the electrolyte and substrate. Different facet alignments not only showed different band structures (energy levels of CBM and VBM, absorbances and thresholds varying from 500 nm for (001) and (110) to 600 nm for (111)) but also showed different degrees of polarization (Fig. 23a and b). The amount of polarization of the ferroelectric material measured using P–E hysteresis loops showed a tendency of (111) > (110) > (001), which is interestingly identical to the performance of these facets in photoanodes. Thus, the PEC performance of the three different facets was measured with a 50 nm thick BiFeO3 film under polarization of +5 V or −5 V. As shown in Fig. 23c, the larger the polarization, the more favourable the band bending for hole transfer to the electrolyte. The optimum facet, (111) BiFeO3, gave Jph of 0.080 mA cm−2 at 0.533 VRHE and an onset potential of 0.18 VRHE in 0.5 M Na2SO4 (pH 5.67) under 1 sun irradiation. Even though the current density Jph is quite low, the Vph of around 1.1 V is quite promising (Fig. 23d).

BiFeO3 and its variants have a very unique feature of allowing band gap engineering. It is possible to reduce the band gap of BiFeO3 by making a solid solution with Mn (5% Mn-doped BiFeO3, Eg = 2.5 eV),147 Cr (Bi2FeCrO6, Eg = 1.5 eV)148 and K (KBiFe2O5, Eg = 1.6 eV).149 Attempts to apply it as a photoelectrode for PEC cells have not yet been successful; however, this application would be interesting to study. Especially, Bi2FeCrO6 (grown by PLD on a STO substrate) as a ferroelectric photovoltaic cell achieved a PCE of 8.1%, which is absolutely remarkable as a metal oxide light absorber. Efforts to synthesize and use the material as a photoelectrode would be interesting, although we have yet to see any notable cases.
Recently, non-stoichiometric composites of Bi and Fe, such as Bi2Fe4O9, with promising properties have been reported.151 A polycrystalline Bi2Fe4O9 film was synthesized by a simple solution-based process using Bi nitrate and Fe nitrate dissolved in 2-methoxy ethanol and acetic hydride. The PEC performance of the film was measured; the photocurrent density was 0.18 mA cm−2 @ 0.6 VAg/AgCl (∼1.23 VRHE) in 0.5 M Na2SO4 + H2O2 and the onset potential was 0.0 VAg/AgCl (∼0.63 VRHE). Its optical properties were also very similar to those of BiFeO3, with a direct bandgap of 2.06 eV and an indirect bandgap of 1.29 eV according to the Tauc plot.
In addition to the composition of Bi and Fe, another metal, such as W, can be added to form composite ternary metal oxides. By high throughput combinatorial analysis, Yan et al.152 proposed that interphases of Bi–Fe–W combinatorial metal oxide libraries could provide modest PEC performance with optimization of synthesis conditions. They described some other promising metal oxides with low band gaps (Eg = 1.6 to 2.4 eV) and inherent water stability by studying combinations of transition metals (e.g. vanadates of Cu, Fe, Mn, Co, and Ni).152,153 However, most of the materials showed Vph lower than 0.4 V, which is far lower than that of well-developed BiVO4. However, they recently found a promising candidate of Fe0.56W0.38Bi0.06Oz (with the XRD pattern of FeWO4 + Bi2O3) that showed significant PEC properties as a promising new metal oxide light absorber.
One thing to note is their combinatorial synthesis method. Metal elements of Bi/Fe/W with various ratios were deposited on FTO under controlled gas conditions of Ar (6 mTorr) and annealed in air to form photoactive oxide phases of the elements (Fig. 24). Thus, FTO/Fe0.56W0.38Bi0.06Oz showed a great onset potential of 0.4 VRHE (comparable to that of BiVO4) and Jph around 0.15 mA cm−2 @ 1.23 VRHE in a sulphite hole scavenger solution under 1 sun illumination, and the photon utilization threshold identified by EQE (=IPCE) was ∼2.0 eV. A water photooxidation current Jph of ∼0.05 mA cm−2 @ 1.23 VRHE was achieved in pH 9 borate buffer, which is relatively good for a new material.

By MS plots and a comparison of materials prepared in air or Ar, two different phases of n-FeWO4 (Efb = 0.35 VRHE, in good agreement with the onset potential in sulphite oxidation) and p-FeWO4 (Efb = ∼2.1 VRHE, roughly close to its VBM) were responsible for their n- or p-type characteristics, which indicates that the Bi component did not contribute to their performance in a significant way. In comparison to Fe2WO6 (which is discussed later), Vph was greatly increased; thus, Bi contributed to its increased photovoltage and perhaps enlarged the indirect band gaps of FeWO4 or Fe2WO6 phases. In addition to its interesting PEC performance, the material showed relatively long stability of ∼7 days for photo-oxidation of sulfite ion even without any protection layer in a borate buffer solution (pH 9); this suggests that such alloying is an effective strategy to fabricate a new class of metal oxide light absorbers with good stability.
3.5 Yttrium ferrite (YFeO3)
Perovskite-type YFeO3 generally has two crystal systems, hexagonal and orthorhombic phases, which can be controlled by the annealing temperature. Hexagonal YFeO3 can be synthesized by a sol–gel method and calcination below 700 °C, while the orthorhombic phase is obtained above 800 °C.154 In particular, hexagonal YFeO3 exhibits a smaller optical band gap (∼1.8 eV) than the orthorhombic structure (∼2.1 eV); this enables higher light harvesting.155 YFeO3 prepared by a citric acid-assisted sol–gel technique showed pure phases of hexagonal and orthorhombic structures when annealed at 675 °C and 900 °C, respectively. Capacitance curvatures observed by the Mott–Schottky plot for YFeO3 suggest that they are n-type semiconductors. However, there is also a report claiming that YFeO3 is a photocathode material.156 In this case, YFeO3 electrodes were synthesized by two different methods: calcination of an ionic liquid-based precursor at 1000 °C, and spin coating of a sol–gel precursor followed by annealing at 640 °C. Both electrodes showed p-type transient photocurrent responses under chopped illumination; however, their photocurrent densities were much lower than those of n-type YFeO3 photoanodes.
3.6 Iron vanadates (FeVO4, Fe2VO4, FeV2O4, Fe2V4O13)
Although FeVO4 can exist in several phases of triclinic, orthorhombic, and monoclinic wolframite according to its synthesis conditions, triclinic FeVO4 is the only stable phase under ambient conditions and is a well-known material for photoanodes.157–159 The structure of triclinic FeVO4 consists of two different distorted octahedral FeO6, one distorted trigonal bipyramidal FeO5, and tetrahedral (VO4)3− groups. The three independent Fe–O groups create a doubly bent chain via six edge-sharing to form polyhedra, as shown in Fig. 25a. Crystallization starts to occur from 450 °C and is completed above 600 °C, showing Fe–O polyhedra and VO4 tetrahedral groups.160 Triclinic FeVO4 has a space group of P1 with the lattice parameters a ≈ 0.671 nm, b ≈ 0.805 nm, c ≈ 0.930 nm, α ≈ 96.5°, β ≈ 106.7°, and γ ≈ 101.5°.157,159,161 The calculated band structure in Fig. 25b reveals that the conduction band is mainly composed of Fe 3d orbitals plus a small portion of V 3d orbitals, and the valence band is composed of a hybridization of O 2p, Fe 3d, and V 3d orbitals, where O 2p is dominant.162,163 FeVO4 has a direct bandgap of ∼2.6 eV and an indirect bandgap of ∼2.1 eV, and the observed absorption edge of ∼600 nm indicates that photon absorption occurs through an indirect pathway (Fig. 25c and d).69,160,164 The Efb of FeVO4 is ∼0.8 VRHE, which is a more positive value compared to other spinel ferrites (ZnFe2O4, MgFe2O4). Also, the low bandgap energy arises from the high conduction band position, which results in a more anodic onset potential.

The photoactivity of a triclinic FeVO4 photoanode was discovered in 2007 by Sayama's group during screening of various Fe-based ternary oxides.165 Subsequently, intrinsic or extrinsic doping was performed to improve its charge separation efficiency and conductivity. Motivated by its successful effects in CuVO4 (ref. 166) and BiVO4,167 W6+ was introduced as an extrinsic n-type dopant for substituting V5+ sites to increase n-type conductivity.168 FeVO4 and W-doped FeVO4 films were prepared by metal–organic deposition on FTO glass via spin-coating. This process was repeated layer-by-layer until the thickness of the film reached ∼900 nm. The photocurrent density doubled to 100 μA cm−2 at 1.23 VRHE in 0.1 M KPi (pH 7) solution after W doping. This increase was attributed to the enhanced charge carrier concentration, although this was not experimentally confirmed.
Recently, in-depth study of bare and Mo-doped FeVO4 revealed the intrinsic properties of FeVO4 and suggested its limitations as well.69 The FeVO4 electrodes with a thickness of 200 nm were fabricated by spray pyrolysis. The FeVO4 film showed an absorption edge of ∼600 nm, which is consistent with an indirect bandgap of 2.07 eV. For undoped FeVO4, ηsurf was 80%, while ηbulk was near 1% at 1.23 VRHE and less than 2% in the entire potential range, indicating very poor bulk charge transport. The success of the Mo6+ doping was confirmed by the lower angle shifts of the XRD peaks and the decreased slope of the Mott–Schottky plot. At a high potential of 1.6 VRHE, ηsurf reached ∼100% and ηbulk increased to ∼2.5%. However, the enhancement in both charge separation efficiencies was insignificant at a lower potential of 1.23 VRHE. As a result, 2% Mo doping into FeVO4 increased photocurrent density by ∼40% at high potentials (>1.6 VRHE) from 0.04 mA cm−2 for pristine to 0.05 mA cm−2 for Mo-doped FeVO4, as shown in Fig. 26a. The IPCE analysis in Fig. 26b also confirmed strong enhancement between 380 and 480 nm. The direct band transition of this material is 2.6 eV (or 480 nm); above this wavelength to the indirect band edge, no significant doping effect can be seen. The carrier transport properties were investigated with time-resolved microwave conductivity (TRMC) measurements to find hole mobilities of ∼4.6 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 for pristine FeVO4 and ∼1.5 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for 2% Mo-doped FeVO4. The lifetime of the charge carriers also increased from ∼29 ns to ∼136 ns after Mo doping. The hole diffusion length was calculated for the pristine (∼2 nm) and the Mo-doped FeVO4 (∼7 nm) using the obtained mobility and lifetime.

Optical and charge transport properties of a FeVO4 film (170 nm thick) were investigated, which was fabricated by a sol–gel method and drop-casted on FTO glass.77 With a bandgap energy of 2.06 eV, the theoretical photocurrent density of the film is 12.9 mA cm−2; however, the maximum absorption photocurrent of FeVO4 in this work was only 3.83 mA cm−2, corresponding to only 30% of its theoretical absorption capacity, due to its poor light harvesting capability. Additionally, the narrow space charge region and poor hole transport properties caused poor ηbulk, resulting in an efficiency loss of 27%. The difference between the theoretical and the actual absorption current is due to the low absorption coefficient and the insufficient absorption depth. In addition, the intrinsic hole transport properties in the bulk of FeVO4 should be improved. In another study, FeVO4 nanoparticles were coated by ultrathin g-C3N4 by dipping FeVO4 electrode into a g-C3N4 solution followed by thermal annealing to improve charge carrier density and separation efficiency.169
Although triclinic FeVO4 is well studied as a photoanode material, combinatorial synthesis of Fe–V–O thin films revealed that Fe2V4O13 could be fabricated in a low-Fe region of 11 to 42 atomic% and FeVO4 could be obtained from 37 to 79 atomic%.164 All the samples in this work were mixed phases of Fe2V4O13/Fe2O3 or FeVO4/Fe2O3. The photocurrent density of the film dominated by Fe2V4O13 was ∼28 μA cm−2 and that of the FeVO4-dominated electrode was ∼190 μA cm−2 at 1.6 VRHE. Also, optical and PEC analyses were conducted on Fe2V4O13.170 The direct and indirect bandgaps were 2.35 and 2.25 eV, respectively. W doping increased the photocurrent density of Fe2V4O13 from ∼17 μA cm−2 to ∼27 μA cm−2 at 1.23 VRHE. Several kinds of iron vanadates (e.g. FeVO4, FeV2O4, Fe2VO4) were compared.171 Reduced ions such as Fe2+, V4+, and V3+ afforded FeV2O4 and Fe2VO4; these had higher carrier concentrations, resulting in enhanced photocurrent densities compared to that of FeVO4, although they started to decrease gradually within 30 min of PEC water splitting.
The studies reported to date indicate that FeVO4 suffers from the same problems as other iron-containing metal oxides, namely short hole diffusion length less than 10 nm, low absorption coefficient, and poor bulk properties, which lead to low photocurrent generation. The effects of n-type dopants such as W and Mo were insufficient to significantly overcome those limitations. Additionally, the very positive Efb position (∼0.8 VRHE) is a limiting factor to achieve high photovoltage. More research on intrinsic/extrinsic doping or nanostructuring for better charge separation is needed in addition to new synthetic methods to change the fundamental properties of FeVO4.
3.7 Iron tungstates (FeWO4 + Fe2WO6)
Fe2WO6 was first investigated in 1982 by Leiva et al.172 as an n-type photoanode material. It can be synthesized from equal proportions of Fe2O3 and WO3. Fe2WO6 has a narrower bandgap of 1.5 to 1.7 eV (ref. 173 and 174) than Fe2O3 (∼2.2 eV) and WO3 (∼2.9 eV); however, its relatively high Efb of ∼0.71 VRHE limits its obtainable photovoltage. Abdi et al.174 revealed the key parameters that promote or limit the PEC efficiency of Fe2WO6. Fe2WO6 has two possible crystal phases: orthorhombic structure at low temperature (<800 °C) and tri-α-PbO2 phase at high temperature (>800 °C). The latter shows better performance not only of photocurrent density but also of charge injection and separation efficiencies.
However, Fe2WO6 still has severe limitations for PEC water splitting. The photocurrent density of Fe2WO6 was 0.075 mA cm−2 at 1.23 VRHE and the onset potential was 0.95 VRHE. One of the major parameters limiting the performance of Fe2WO6 is its small absorption coefficient. The light penetration depth (α−1) is over 1000 nm in the wavelength region above 500 nm (photon energy of 1.5–2.5 eV), representing poor photon absorption. In addition, the carrier diffusion length measured by TRMC was ∼10 nm, resulting in poor ηbulk of below 7%. Furthermore, the valence band maximum was located at ∼1.7 eV below the Fermi level by UPS analysis. Because it has a bandgap of 1.7 eV, its conduction band is located very close to the Fermi level (∼0.66 VRHE). This positive conduction band requires a large external bias and provides limited photovoltage.
3.8 Iron titanate (Fe2TiO5)
The band structure of Fe2TiO5 is compared with those of Fe2O3 and TiO2 in Fig. 27a. The stoichiometry of Fe2TiO5 is the exact intermediate of TiO2 and Fe2O3, and it is expected to inherit the narrow bandgap of Fe2O3 and the excellent electronic properties of TiO2. It has ideal band positions that straddle the redox potentials of water. In reality, however, the charge transport properties of Fe2TiO5 are not better than those of Fe2O3. To accelerate the charge transport, nanostructured Fe2TiO5, such as nanotubes175 and inverse-opal structures,70,176 has been investigated. Zhang et al.175 engineered highly ordered Fe2TiO5 nanotube arrays on FTO glass. A mixed solution of Fe and Ti precursors was spin-coated on an anodic aluminium oxide (AAO) template with 90 nm diameter and 1000 nm length. The pristine Fe2TiO5 nanotube was fabricated by 4 min of hybrid microwave annealing (HMA). Then, the photocurrent density of 0.34 mA cm−2 at 1.23 VRHE observed for pristine Fe2TiO5 increased to 0.93 mA cm−2 at 1.23 VRHE after multiple modifications of the TiO2 underlayer, H2 treatment, and loading of FeNiOx co-catalyst (Fig. 27b). An inverse-opal structured Fe2TiO5 photoanode was also fabricated by Zhang et al.70 The SEM image of the 3-layered inverse-opal structure (IOS) of Fe2TiO5 is shown in Fig. 27c. IOS can provide enhanced light harvesting ability owing to the strong diffuse scattering and continuous internal scattering of photons. Therefore, the pristine Fe2TiO5 with the inverse-opal structure showed a better photocurrent density of 0.49 mA cm−2 at 1.23 VRHE than Fe2TiO5 nanotube arrays (0.34 mA cm−2). With a multitude of modifications, the photocurrent density increased to 2.08 mA cm−2 at 1.23 VRHE, which represents the best performance of an Fe2TiO5 photoanode as a single light absorber reported to date (Fig. 27d).

4. Promising ferrites for photocathodes
4.1 Delafossite (CuFeO2)
CuFeO2 has a delafossite structure with the general formula of A+B3+O2, as shown in Fig. 28a. The typical A-site cations are Cu, Ag, Pd, or Pt, while the B cations can be Fe, Cr, Ga, Al, In, Co, etc.177 Among the various delafossite materials, CuFeO2 has attracted great attention as a photocathode material. Its structure is composed of a layer of linearly coordinated A cations, which are stacked between distorted edge-shared octahedral layers (BO6) with unit cell lattice parameters of a = b = 3.0349 Å and c = 17.1656 Å.67 CuFeO2 can exist in two crystal systems depending on the stacking of A cation layers, rhombohedral (space group Rm) or hexagonal (space group P63/mmc) polytypes; most PEC applications employ rhombohedral CuFeO2.177 Its p-type conductivity stems from the ultrafast (500 fs) relaxation of VB holes from O 2p to the hybridized Cu 3d state.178 According to the DFT calculations shown in Fig. 28b, its valence band is mostly composed of Cu 3d states with some degree of hybridization with O 2p, while the conduction band is dominated by Fe 3d. The absorption coefficient (α) of CuFeO2 film is reported as ∼105 cm−1 at 600 nm (Fig. 28c), which is thousands of times higher than that of Cu2O film. It has an indirect bandgap of 1.43–1.55 eV and a direct bandgap of 3.10–3.20 eV.55,67,179 The indirect bandgap is associated with the Cu 3d + O 2p → Fe 3d transition, while the latter is attributed to the Cu 3d + O 2p → Cu 3d + 4s transition.180 In addition, CuFeO2 possesses an appropriate band alignment for both water reduction (HER) and CO2 reduction (CO2RR). Its conduction and valence bands are located around −0.3 VRHE and 1.2 VRHE, respectively.55 Therefore, many researchers have attempted to improve its PEC performance; however, the obtained performance is far below the theoretical limit.

The electronic structure and the thermodynamic stability of bulk CuFeO2 were recently investigated to understand the unsatisfying PEC activity of CuFeO2 photocathodes.182 According to their DFT + U calculations, CuFeO2 is stable in an aqueous environment when the applied bias and pH used in the experiments are in the green region of the Pourbaix diagram shown in Fig. 29. This result explains the origin of the superior resistance of CuFeO2 to photocorrosion. However, even in the stable region, CuFeO2 suffers from a small formation energy of intrinsic point defects, and these antisite defects may favour the recombination of electron–hole pairs generated within the band gap.

These defect states were also observed in other reports.67,78 Prévot et al.78 presented a detailed investigation with photoelectrochemical, spectroscopic, and microscopic tools to clarify the reason for the poor performance observed for sol–gel processed CuFeO2. The TRMC measurements showed that the CuFeO2 films have relatively good bulk properties, such as a charge carrier mobility of 0.2 cm2 V−1 s−1 and a long carrier lifetime of 200 ns. In contrast, the PEC analysis with various redox couples (Fig. 30a) revealed the presence of a high density of trap sites on the surface (1014 cm−2) that prevents the photovoltage (<0.35 V) from reaching the expected value from the ideal semiconductor–liquid junction (SCLJ) and causes the Fermi level pinning (FLP) effect. The following XPS results suggested the presence of surface states as a thin layer of metal hydroxide, as shown in Fig. 30b. The authors concluded that if proper surface treatment successfully passivates the surface of CuFeO2, CuFeO2 can afford a large photovoltage of 0.8 V and reduced surface charge recombination.

Recently, Jiang et al.67 further elucidated the origin of the performance bottleneck of CuFeO2 photocathodes by combining theoretical and experimental investigations. They synthesized high-quality CuFeO2 thin films via reactive co-sputtering, which could separate the effects of phase impurity and structural morphology. The PEC performance of the sputtered CuFeO2 thin films was only ∼50 μA cm−2 at 0.4 VRHE without sacrificial reagent. Even with a sacrificial electron acceptor (O2, ηsurf = 1), the film showed an order of magnitude lower photocurrent (0.85 mA cm−2 at 0.4 VRHE) than the theoretical maximum value (24.2 mA cm−2), which indicates that most of the photogenerated charge carriers are recombined before reaching SCLJ. The authors further conducted time-resolved optical spectroscopy to understand the origin of the severe bulk charge transfer limitation. The differential absorption spectra showed extremely short free carrier lifetimes (<1 ps) in CuFeO2. This value should be compared with a previous report by Prévot et al.,78 which provided a much longer conducting charge carrier lifetime (200 ns). Generally, transition metal oxides favour the formation of slow and self-trapped charge carriers, which are called small polarons.45 In transition metal oxides at room temperature, the small-polaron hopping mechanism operates, which primarily affects the Hall voltage. Consequently, the polaronic transport in CuFeO2 cannot be used to determine the charge transfer dynamics. Taking these results together, the authors concluded that the photogenerated free carriers are quickly self-trapped and produce small polarons, which play large roles as the governing conduction mechanism in CuFeO2. Additionally, they revealed Cu → Fe metal-to-metal charge transfer through resonant inelastic X-ray scattering spectroscopy (RIXS), which exhibits a high tendency toward self-trapping of free charge carriers.
CuFeO2 photocathodes have been prepared by several methods, such as electrodeposition, sol–gel-based processes, solid-state reactions, and co-sputtering.55,67,179,183 Read et al.179 synthesized nanocrystalline CuFeO2 electrodes by electrochemical deposition of pure ternary Cu–Fe–O phase followed by annealing at 650 °C under inert atmosphere (Fig. 31a and b). The resulting CuFeO2 films showed an onset potential of 0.98 VRHE. The transient photocurrent density was −0.085 mA cm−2 at 0.6 VRHE in Ar-purged 1 M NaOH (pH 14), and it gradually decreased to a steady-state photocurrent of −0.016 mA cm−2. In contrast, when the electrolyte was purged with O2 as a sacrificial electron acceptor, the initial photocurrent density increased to −0.16 mA cm−2 at 0.6 VRHE, which was maintained without noticeable decay. The IPCE remained entirely low, recording 2.2% and 3.7% at 350 nm in the Ar-purged and O2-purged electrolyte, respectively, at 0.6 VRHE. The authors argued that CuFeO2 showed low photoactivity because of insufficient photon utilization by the thin film (100–130 nm, Fig. 31c), charge recombination by the surface states on the nanocrystalline surface, and its poor catalytic surface for HER. Although the photocurrent-to-H2 conversion ratio was very low (∼0.65%), this report demonstrated for the first time that photogenerated electrons in the CB can be utilized for HER. This work suggested revising the synthesis method, optimizing the thickness and morphology, and finding an appropriate HEC to increase the efficiency of CuFeO2 as a photocathode for PEC cells.

Electrodeposited CuFeO2 films often contain CuO as a secondary phase, and this mixed-phase material can drive the kinetically more challenging CO2 reduction reaction with formate or acetate as the major products.181,184 For example, CuFeO2 and CuO heterostructure electrodes photoelectrochemically reduced CO2 to formate with high selectivity (>90%) and showed a remarkable solar-to-formate conversion efficiency (∼1%) for over a week without external bias.184 It has been postulated that this CuFeO2/CuO heterostructure can facilitate the electron transfer from CuFeO2 to CuO. The CuFeO2/CuO mixed phase can also convert CO2 to acetate with reasonable faradaic efficiency (∼80%) in a PEC system.181 However, it was recently reported that there is no evidence for electron injection from CuFeO2 to CuO according to DFT calculations and transient absorption measurements.185 Although the PEC CO2R catalytic activity is derived from electrodeposited CuFeO2/CuO mixed phase electrodes, the active sites and the role of each component remain to be identified.
The sol–gel method is another representative method for synthesizing CuFeO2. Prévot et al.55 prepared CuFeO2 electrodes by spin-coating a Cu and Fe-containing precursor solution onto FTO followed by annealing at 700 °C in inert atmosphere. This solution-based process allowed easy control of the film thickness, as shown in Fig. 32a. The optimized CuFeO2 film had a thickness of 290 nm and showed an onset potential at 0.9 VRHE and a steady-state photocurrent density of about −1.05 mA cm−2 at 0.4 VRHE in O2-purged 1 M NaOH (Fig. 32b). Moreover, CuFeO2 electrodes showed remarkable durability for 40 h at 0.4 VRHE in O2-bubbled 1 M NaOH. However, the photocurrent density for solar water reduction was extremely low (−0.025 mA cm−2 at 0.4 VRHE) in Ar-purged NaOH. For the stable operation of a CuFeO2 photocathode with enhanced photocurrent density in a PEC device, AZO and TiO2 overlayers were deposited on CuFeO2 by ALD, and then Pt was photodeposited as a cocatalyst. The resulting CuFeO2/AZO/TiO2/Pt photocathode recorded −0.4 mA cm−2 at 0 VRHE and exhibited a stable photocurrent for 50 min at −0.2 VRHE in Ar-bubbled 0.5 M Na2SO4 (Fig. 32c).

Subsequently, the same research group applied CuAlO2 as a supporting frame to improve the poor charge separation properties of CuFeO2.88 CuAlO2 has a large band gap (3.5 eV) with good p-type (hole) conductivity, and its band position can form a type II heterojunction with CuFeO2. Especially, its conduction band position is much higher than that of CuFeO2; therefore, the photo-excited electrons cannot be transferred to the substrate side and the hole transfer is facilitated to the CuAlO2 scaffold, as shown in Fig. 33a. Because of the high formation temperature of CuAlO2 (∼1000 °C), it was prepared by an adapted sol–gel technique. The resulting CuAlO2 film showed a mesoporous morphology and large surface area. Compared to the CuFeO2 film alone, CuAlO2/CuFeO2 films demonstrated 2.4 times higher photocurrent density, reaching −2.4 mA cm−2 at 0.4 VRHE in O2-purged 1 M NaOH (Fig. 33b). When CuAlO2 was replaced by an insulating SiO2 layer with a similar morphology, only a small photocurrent was observed; this indicates that photogenerated holes are blocked at the interface of SiO2, which serves as a recombination centre. The authors attributed these results to assisted charge separation through the CuAlO2 scaffold and increased amounts of CuFeO2 deposited on the mesoporous CuAlO2 underlayer.

Jang et al.79 introduced extra oxygen into the CuFeO2 lattice by post-treatment with hybrid microwave annealing (HMA). They prepared CuFeO2 films by a simple solution method, followed by HMA with a silicon susceptor, and compared them with the films treated by conventional thermal annealing (CTA) in a muffle furnace. The photocurrent density of the pristine CuFeO2 film was −0.3 mA cm−2 at 0.4 VRHE, which increased to −1.3 mA cm−2 at 0.4 VRHE with HMA treatment and to −0.62 mA cm−2 at 0.4 VRHE with CTA treatment. Through the surface-sensitive XPS analysis and the bulk-averaged X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) technique, the authors observed that the HMA-treated CuFeO2 films had slightly elongated c-axes, which may be proof of oxygen intercalation. Accordingly, the valences of Cu+ and Fe3+ were changed to Cu2+ and Fe3+δ for charge neutrality, where δ (Cu2+/Cu+) was estimated to be 0.6. This increased the charge density-enhanced photo-excited charge separation in the bulk. After the bulk modification with HMA treatment, the surface of CuFeO2 was further modified with NiFe-layered double hydroxide (LDH)/reduced graphene oxide (RGO) as a hydrogen evolution co-catalyst (HEC). The final HMA-CuFeO2/NiFe-LDH/RGO photocathode showed a photocurrent density of −2.4 mA cm−2 at 0.4 VRHE in Ar-purged 1 M NaOH.
Recently, two-dimensional (2D) photonic crystal (PC) structures consisting of silica particles with ultrathin CuFeO2 overlayers were reported by Oh et al.186 The CuFeO2-coated silica particles were synthesized by the Stöber process, followed by a Pechini sol–gel process. They then rubbed the silica microspheres@CuFeO2 beads with polydimethylsiloxane to assemble a monolayer architecture on polyethylenimine-pretreated FTO. The resulting film served as a self-light-harvesting architecture that showed enhanced light absorption ability and remarkable transparency (76.4%). With the 410 nm-sized silica microspheres, this 2D-PC photocathode showed −0.2 mA cm−2 at 0.6 VRHE in O2-purged 1 M NaOH. In the optical analysis, they observed the existence of a photonic stop band that can produce slow light and magnify the light absorption. In a follow-up report by the same group, they fabricated a double-shelled heterojunction photocathode by further coating the silica microsphere@CuFeO2 with CuAlO2 and partial etching (PE) of silica by hot NaOH treatment.187 The resulting PE-SiO2@CuFeO2@CuAlO2 electrode showed 9-fold increased photocurrent density (−1.09 mA cm−2 at 0.6 VRHE) in O2-purged 1 M NaOH compared to that of the single-shelled electrode without CuAlO2 (−0.12 mA cm−2 at 0.6 VRHE). The reduced charge transfer resistance of the double-shelled photocathode was demonstrated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Recently, they magnified the visible-light harvesting efficiency of CuFeO2 by introducing an inverse opal (IO) structure.90 The IO CuFeO2 photocathodes were prepared using an opal template-assisted sol-infiltration method. They then deposited the C60/CoFe LDH co-catalyst via a simple dip coating and electrodeposition method. After surface modification, the IO CuFeO2/C60/CoFe LDH photocathode showed −4.86 mA cm−2 at 0 VRHE in Ar-purged 1 M NaOH with an IPCE of 17.5% at 600 nm. The authors attributed this unprecedented high performance to the macroscopic structure, which allows increased scattering within the light absorber near the band edge.
Despite the efforts of many research groups, the PEC activity of CuFeO2 remains far below its theoretical value. In order to overcome its deleterious surface states and faulty bulk charge transport/transfer properties, innovative strategies are needed to passivate the surface states effectively and improve the charge diffusion length. Doping is one of the remaining tasks to improve the poor bulk properties of CuFeO2, although there are still contradicting reports of the effects of doping on CuFeO2 photocathodes.185,188
4.2 Lanthanum ferrite (LaFeO3)
LaFeO3 has a distorted perovskite structure, as shown in Fig. 34a and b; the La atom is located in the centre of a cube consisting of eight Fe atoms at the corners, which are octahedrally coordinated with O.189 It has a space group of Pnma with a = 5.554 Å, b = 5.568 Å, c = 7.856 Å.190 The electrical conduction and bipolar relaxation in LaFeO3 are governed by polaronic hopping between Fe3+ and Fe4+, which can be formed by intrinsic defects (e.g., La vacancies).191 According to DFT calculations, the VB of LaFeO3 contains contributions of hybridized O 2p and Fe 3d orbitals, while its VB is composed mostly of Fe 3d orbitals with a direct bandgap of 2.13 eV (Fig. 34c).66 However, there has been some controversy over the actual bandgap of LaFeO3. In previous studies, the bandgap obtained through Tauc plot analysis was spread over 2.16–2.70 eV.76,192,193 This large uncertainty may arise from the electronic complexity of perovskite oxides. Because LaFeO3 has multiple bands and its CB and VB are composed of hybridized metal–oxygen orbitals, complicated absorption processes can occur.194 Recently, the bandgap of LaFeO3 was found to be ∼2.2 eV by both computational and experimental investigations.66 Its CB and VB straddle the water redox potentials, which enables overall water splitting.76 For instance, Pawar et al.193 used LaFeO3 as a photoelectrode for unbiased hydrogen evolution. LaFeO3 was fabricated by spray pyrolysis, and an unbiased hydrogen evolution system of a LaFeO3/Pt two-electrode cell was demonstrated, which produced hydrogen for 6 h. Additionally, LaFeO3 is a rare p-type metal oxide material which is stable against photocorrosion; this can provide significant benefit over Cu-containing oxide photocathode materials.76 There was a report that a pulsed laser deposited p-LaFeO3/n-Fe2O3 photocell produced hydrogen and oxygen for 120 h without any sign of decay.195 Moreover, it has an extremely positive onset potential (>1.2 VRHE).

Despite its many advantages, LaFeO3 presents inferior PEC performance because of extensive bulk electron–hole recombination. Therefore, doping can be a suitable strategy to increase its charge transport properties and decrease its charge recombination. Díez-García et al.56 introduced Mg2+ and Zn2+ as external dopants. They prepared LaFeO3 thin films through a citric sol–gel process followed by annealing at 640 °C for 2 h in air. The resulting LaFeO3 film showed a photocurrent density of −0.015 mA cm−2 at 0.6 VRHE in O2-purged 0.1 M NaOH (Fig. 35a). After partial substitution of Fe3+ by Mg2+ or Zn2+, the photocurrent densities significantly increased from that of pristine LaFeO3. More specifically, the best photocurrent was observed in 5% doped samples (−0.075 mA cm−2 for LaFe0.95Zn0.05O3, −0.092 mA cm−2 for LaFe0.95Mg0.05O3 at 0.6 VRHE, see the blue curves in Fig. 35a). The enhancement of p-type conductivity upon the introduction of Mg and Zn was verified by the increased slopes of Mott–Schottky analysis, as presented in Fig. 35b.

The increased majority (hole) carrier concentration was attributed to a dopant-induced increase of Fe4+ density caused by charge compensation. In XRD, SEM, and transmission UV/vis spectral analyses, there were no significant changes in the crystal structure, surface morphology, or light absorbance after doping. However, XPS depth profiling spectra showed that the dopant concentration at the surface was 7–8 times higher than that in the bulk. The authors noted that this segregation of dopants is related to the greater hygroscopic tendency of the Mg and Zn species than of Fe. However, the observed effects of doping were not as significant in PEC water reduction (N2-purged), as expected from O2 reduction (black spectrum in Fig. 35a). Although the transient photocurrent spikes were enlarged after doping, the steady state photocurrent densities remained poor (≤5 μA cm−2 at 0.6 VRHE). Thus, although Mg and Zn dopants can improve the bulk charge transport properties, additional strategies are needed to passivate the surface charge recombination.
Wheeler and Choi76 reported the PEC properties and stability of electrodeposited LaFeO3 photocathodes. They synthesized a nanoporous film with a high surface area via co-electrodeposition of La(OH)3 and Fe(OH)3 followed by annealing at 600 °C for 3 h in air. The as-synthesized film showed a direct bandgap of 2.16 eV in its Tauc plot, and its flat band potential was estimated as 1.45 VRHE by Mott–Schottky analysis. In PEC measurements, the LaFeO3 electrode started to show photo-response at 1.41 VRHE, and it reached −0.1 mA cm−2 at 0.8 VRHE in O2-purged 0.1 M NaOH. On the other hand, when the same electrolyte was purged with N2, the onset potential was negatively shifted to 1.27 VRHE and a much smaller steady-state photocurrent density (<10 μA cm−2) was observed in the entire potential range. The authors attributed this result to severe charge recombination at the interface between LaFeO3 and the electrolyte and the poor catalytic surface of LaFeO3 films for HER. However, the stability of LaFeO3 was verified in both oxygen and water reduction for 1 h, indicating that LaFeO3 does not suffer from severe photocorrosion.
Recently, the same group reported a combined theoretical and experimental investigation on substitutional doping of LaFeO3 with K+ at the La sites.66 They first systematically examined the effects of K-doping on the electronic and atomic structures, hole-polaron formation, and optical properties of LaFeO3. The bandgap decreased from 2.13 to 2.06 eV after K-doping. The formation of an isolated hole-polaron state, a hybridized state of the O 2p and Fe 3d orbitals, was observed to be located at 0.3 eV above the VBM (see Fig. 36a). This suggests that the two holes generated by the substitution of La3+ with K+ are localized on Fe atoms and their neighbouring O atoms, forming Fe4+ by charge compensation (Fig. 36b). The calculated absorption spectra showed obviously increased absorption in the low-energy range (<2.4 eV) after the K-doping. This enhancement is attributed to the introduction of disturbed states below the CBM. Lastly, they obtained theoretically estimated cell parameters that showed ∼0.3% shrunk unit cell volume after the replacement of La3+ with K+. The authors assessed that the degree of cell shrinkage caused by Fe4+ formation was greater than the degree of expansion caused by the K-doping.

Their computational expectation was verified experimentally by comparing pure and K-doped LaFeO3. UV-vis spectra and Tauc plots applied to the absorption spectra indicated that the bandgap of pure LaFeO3 (2.2 eV) was red-shifted upon K-doping (2.0 eV). Additionally, due to the negligible difference in their morphologies, a qualitative comparison of the majority carrier density could be made using the Mott–Schottky plots. K-doped LaFeO3 showed much smaller slopes, implying a larger majority carrier density. The amount of Fe4+, an indicator of p-type conductivity, in K-doped LaFeO3 (15.9%) was ∼2 times higher than that of pristine LaFeO3 (7.7%). Finally, the J–V plots for the oxygen reduction showed a significantly increased photocurrent density of K-doped LaFeO3 (−0.268 mA cm−2 at 0.6 VRHE) relative to that of pristine LaFeO3 (−0.124 mA cm−2 at 0.6 VRHE) (Fig. 36c). The IPCE also showed the enhanced photon-to-current conversion efficiency caused by K-doping (Fig. 36d). The photo-stabilities of the two electrodes were also confirmed over 15 h (Fig. 36e). On the other hand, there was no remarkable effect of K-doping on water reduction (Fig. 36f). The K-doped sample showed a significant increase in transient photocurrent spikes, while the steady state photocurrent remained similar to that of pristine LaFeO3. The authors suggested that an appropriate HEC would passivate the surface states to increase the water reduction activity.
There are some recent reports that the PEC performance of LaFeO3 photocathodes can be improved by introducing an Au buffer layer between the substrate and LaFeO3 and by incorporating Ag nanoparticles into the LaFeO3 film.196,197 In addition, there is much room for improving the PEC performance of LaFeO3, such as dual doping and surface passivation with a proper co-catalyst or hole selective layer.
4.3 Calcium ferrite (CaFe2O4)
CaFe2O4 possesses a distorted spinel structure (Fig. 37a) and is one of the most studied p-type ferrite materials for PEC applications because of its earth-abundant elements and suitable bandgap (1.9 eV) with a proper band edge position for water reduction (CBM: −0.6 VRHE, VBM: 1.3 VRHE).63 According to Fig. 37c, CaFe2O4 can absorb light up to 650 nm, which corresponds to its bandgap. More specifically, the absorption of UV light corresponds to a direct transition (O2− 2p → Fe3+ 3d), while that of visible light matches an indirect transition (spin-forbidden Fe3+ d → d excitation).105 In 1987, Matsumoto et al.198 introduced CaFe2O4 as a new photocathode material for hydrogen evolution. Since this report, efforts have been focused to improve its PEC performance. For instance, Ida et al. reported (hk0)-oriented CaFe2O4 photocathodes on a Pt substrate and demonstrated the hydrogen evolution ability of CaFe2O4 by constructing a p-CaFe2O4/n-TiO2 photocell, as shown in Fig. 37d; the photocell generated hydrogen and oxygen without any external voltage for 48 h (Fig. 37e).63 Recently, the same group reported that coating the surface of CaFe2O4 with TiO2 is beneficial to enhance the chemical stability of CaFe2O4 and the onset potential (to ∼1.6 VRHE) under visible light irradiation (470 nm).199 They demonstrated continuous H2 and O2 evolution for 14 h using a TiO2-coated CaFe2O4 photocathode and Pt anode system with reasonable faradaic efficiencies of 92% and 70% for H2 and O2 evolution, respectively.

In order to investigate the behaviour of photogenerated charge carriers in the bulk and the semiconductor/electrolyte interface, Díez-García and Gómez201 conducted intensive electrochemical impedance spectroscopic studies of CaFe2O4 electrodes. They revealed that most of the recombination of photogenerated charge carriers (99.7%) occurs in the bulk of CaFe2O4, while most of the electrons are successfully transferred from its CB to water and contribute to H2 generation. The poor bulk properties of CaFe2O4 were attributed to its distorted crystal structure because the charge mobility is highly controlled by the overlap of atomic orbitals. Like most ferrite materials, the VB of CaFe2O4 is derived from hybridized Fe 3d and O 2p orbitals. CaFe2O4 has a distorted spinel structure, where Ca atom is octahedrally coordinated with oxygen while Fe atom is surrounded by six O atoms;202 therefore, the increased overlap of the atomic orbitals can cause the low charge mobility.
In the work of Matsumoto et al.,198 they used high temperatures above 1200 °C to activate CaFe2O4 for PEC activity. It is not always the case that only high temperature-annealed CaFe2O4 shows PEC activity. In a recent study by Kirchberg and Marschall,203 mesoporous CaFe2O4 photocathodes were synthesized under relatively low temperature (700 °C) within a short time by a polymer-assisted sol–gel process. The authors conducted grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) and found the minimum annealing temperature for crystalline and pure CaFe2O4 formation was 700 °C. By adding polymer to the precursor solution, the surface area of the CaFe2O4 film was increased, and this triggered enhanced charge transfer and reduced bulk charge recombination. Although the PEC activity of sol–gel synthesized CaFe2O4 for water reduction is limited (−12 μA cm−2 at 0.5 VRHE) because of its prevalent bulk and surface recombination and CaCO3 impurities on the surface, this report demonstrated for the first time that the polymer-assisted solution-based technique can be used to fabricate mesoporous CaFe2O4 photocathodes on FTO substrate without damaging the substrate. Further optimizations such as surface passivation, doping, and heterojunctions based on this method may lead to highly active CaFe2O4 electrodes.
Introducing proper dopants can improve the structural symmetry by reducing the overlap of Fe 3d and O 2p orbitals. Sekizawa et al.200 synthesized various metal-doped CaFe2O4 (M-CaFe2O4; M = Ag, Au, Cu, Pd, and Ir) photocathodes by radio frequency magnetron co-sputtering followed by annealing at 650 °C in O2 atmosphere. Among these, Ag, Au, and Cu-doped CaFe2O4 films showed more enhanced photocurrent than the pristine CaFe2O4 film. In particular, Ag-doped CaFe2O4 films exhibited the highest performance (23-fold higher photocurrent than undoped CaFe2O4). In the case of Cu or Au doping, the photocurrent density increased by the red-shifted absorption edge and plasmonic resonance effect, respectively. However, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) analyses revealed that their crystal structures were further distorted from that of the original CaFe2O4. On the other hand, Ag-doped CaFe2O4 showed both enhanced photo-absorption and structural symmetry. The relaxed crystal structure of Ag-doped CaFe2O4 significantly reduced the overlap of the Fe 3d and O 2p orbitals and induced 4.6 times greater carrier mobility than that of undoped CaFe2O4. Although their studies were not conducted under standardized PEC measurement conditions (non-unified light intensity and unknown electrode surface area), their qualitative structural analyses of various metal-doped CaFe2O4 samples is noteworthy.
CaFe2O4 is one of the most investigated ternary oxide photocathodes; however, the progress of its PEC performance is still unsatisfactory. The synthesis of pure and uniform CaFe2O4 film remains a challenge because of its very high formation temperature. Thus, the inferior PEC performance reported to date may not represent its native material properties. It is necessary to synthesize good-quality CaFe2O4 and further develop it into a photocathode in order to properly evaluate its potential as a practical photocathode for PEC water splitting.
In an attempt to improve the catalytic performance of photoelectrodes, CaFe2O4 was applied to a p–n heterojunction system.204–206 CaFe2O4 has a more positive VBM than the water oxidation potential, and both its CBM and VBM are more negative than those of various photoanode materials, such as TaON, BiVO4, and Fe2O3 (Fig. 38a). Thus, CaFe2O4 and these photoanodes can form effective type II heterojunction systems. For instance, Kim et al.204 fabricated a TaON/CaFe2O4 heterojunction by sequential electrophoretic deposition of two semiconductor powders. The successful heterojunction system was verified by its 5 times increased photocurrent density (1.26 mA cm−2 at 1.23 VRHE) relative to a single TaON electrode (0.23 mA cm−2 at 1.23 VRHE). The IPCE value of the TaON/CaFe2O4 electrode, shown in Fig. 38b, was also significantly increased (∼30%) at 400 nm from that of TaON electrode (∼5%). After loading cobalt phosphate (Co-Pi) as an OEC by electrodeposition, stoichiometric H2 and O2 evolution was demonstrated with a faradaic efficiency of 80%. Similarly, CaFe2O4 was applied as an overlayer of a BiVO4 photoanode to facilitate charge separation.205 By using hydrogen peroxide as a hole scavenger, it was confirmed that BiVO4/CaFe2O4 heterojunction formation decreased the charge recombination on the electrode surface with little effect on the bulk charge separation.

Ca2Fe2O5 is another phase of oxide comprising Ca2+ and Fe3+. It has the brownmillerite structure, which exhibits p-type conductivity because this structure generally accommodates charge-compensated oxygen interstitials by holes.207 As previously mentioned, the holes in Fe-containing compounds are associated with Fe3+ by forming small polarons to produce a small amount of Fe4+. Recently, Wheeler and Choi208 investigated the PEC properties of a Ca2Fe2O5 photocathode. They first electrodeposited FeOOH onto FTO; then, Ca(NO)3 solution was drop-casted onto the as-deposited FeOOH film. After thermal annealing at 650 °C for 12 h in air, excess Ca was etched out by an acidic solution to obtain electrodes of pure phase Ca2Fe2O5. The resulting film showed a nanoplate morphology and a direct bandgap of ∼2.1 eV. Its CB and VB positions were located at −0.4 and 1.65 VRHE, respectively, which straddle the redox potentials of water and are thus beneficial for solar water splitting. The photocurrent density started to appear at 1.36 VRHE and reached −0.2 mA cm−2 at 0.6 VRHE in 0.5 M borate buffer (pH 11) purged with O2 as a sacrificial electron scavenger. On the other hand, Ca2Fe2O5 electrodes showed a negatively shifted onset potential (1.22 VRHE) and a lower photocurrent density (≤0.1 mA cm−2 at 0.6 VRHE) for reduction of N2-purged water. Notably, in both conditions, the photocurrent densities gradually decreased during a chronoamperometry test. By analysing the morphological, crystalline, and compositional changes before and after photocurrent measurements, the authors concluded that the photoreduction of Fe3+ to Fe2+ can cause atomic disorder on the surface, resulting in photocorrosion. Ca2Fe2O5 photocathodes require an additional protection layer that can suppress Ca leaching and enhance their photostability.
4.4 Nickel ferrite and cobalt ferrite (NiFe2O4 and CoFe2O4)
Spinel ferrites other than CaFe2O4 have been rarely studied as photocathodes. Although p-type ferrites such as NiFe2O4 and CoFe2O4 have relatively small band gaps (<2 eV),209,210 less attention has been given to these materials. Occasionally, there is some controversy over their fundamental optical properties. This debate can be attributed to the properties of the p-type ferrites present in partially or fully inverted spinel structures.103 In order to accurately characterize the optical properties of these ferrites and improve their PEC performance, the degree of inversion must be well controlled through rational design of a synthesis strategy.
Epitaxial CoFe2O4 films synthesized by PLD revealed an indirect band bap of 1.2 eV with a direct band gap of 2.7 eV through optical measurements.211 However, the PEC performance measured for CoFe2O4 was quite low. This film synthesized by nitrate salt solution coating had a porous nanosheet morphology but showed only −0.3 μA cm−2 in 0.1 M Na2S solution at zero voltage.209
According to the computed optical absorption spectrum, the band gap of NiFe2O4 cannot be correctly noted between indirect and direct transitions because it has complex band structures and there is a small overlap between the states which determine the gap.212 Pelletized NiFe2O4 obtained via sintering sol–gel synthesized particles at 850 °C showed p-type conductivity, and its conduction mechanism involves electron hopping.210
4.5 Iron chromium aluminium oxide ((FeCrAl)2O3)
FeCrAl oxide has a stable corundum crystal structure with the space group of Rc, which is the same as hematite, and lattice parameters of a = 4.9832 Å and c = 13.6143 Å.58 Interestingly, its conductivity type changes with the relative ratio of Fe, Cr, and Al, while its crystal structure remains unaltered (Fig. 39a). Sliozberg et al.213 fabricated various compositions of FeCrAl oxides by reactive magnetron co-sputtering and found that p-type conductivity was revealed in the Cr-rich regions (Fe/Cr ∼ 1:2), while n-type conductivity was shown in the Fe-rich areas (Fe/Cr ∼ 2:1). Its photoactivity was first reported in 2014 by an undergraduate student participating in the solar hydrogen activity research kit (SHArK) program.214 In this project, combinatorial optimization of Fe, Cr, and Al precursors was performed by an ink jet printing method. The authors identified that the highest photocathodic performance was achieved near a phase stoichiometry of Fe0.84Cr1.0Al0.16O3. The discovered material exhibited a small band gap of 1.8 eV and a remarkable photovoltage of ∼0.95 V. However, the absorbed photon to current conversion efficiency (APCE) value was low (2.4 × 10−4 at 530 nm) because the synthesis technique was inadequate to fabricate a high-quality metal oxide film. They concluded that further studies should concentrate on optimizing the optical and electronic properties and co-catalyst selection to produce more efficient hydrogen-evolving photocathodes.

To overcome poor optical and electronic properties, Kondofersky et al.58 recently prepared nanostructured FeCrAl oxide photocathodes by a sol–gel method (Fig. 39b). The precursor solution of the FeCrAl oxide had a ratio of 0.42:0.5:0.08, which was found to yield the highest IPCE values.214 This solution was spin coated onto FTO, followed by annealing at 525 °C for 1.5 h. The resulting mesoporous film showed a photocurrent density of −0.25 mA cm−2 at 0.5 VRHE and a positive onset potential at 1.1 VRHE (Fig. 39d). They further enhanced the photocurrent density by introducing poly(methylmethacrylate) (PMMA) spheres as a template to form a macroporous morphology (Fig. 39c). An inverse opal (IO) microporous Fe0.84Cr1.0Al0.16O3 photocathode exhibited drastically increased PEC properties, as shown in Fig. 39d (−0.68 mA cm−2 at 0.5 VRHE, IPCE of 28% at 400 nm). Although its PEC performance is comparable to or higher than those of other metal-oxide photocathodes such as Cu2O and CuFeO2, its hydrogen evolution ability is poor (<1 μM during 30 min). Some additional strategies are required to improve their hydrogen evolution ability.
5. Challenges and perspective
5.1 Current challenges
In the present review article, we have discussed ferrites as light absorber materials to fabricate photoelectrodes that can function in aqueous medium for PEC water splitting. Unfortunately, their performance in general is fairly low in comparison to that of other well-established materials, namely photocurrent densities of 0.1–1.0 mA cm−2 at the short circuit voltage (1.23 VRHE for photoanodes and 0.0 VRHE for photocathodes) and photovoltages much less than 0.2 V. If photoelectrodes based on ZnFe2O4 (Eg = ∼2.3 eV, Jabs = 10 mA cm−2) and CuFeO2 (Eg = 1.5 eV, Jabs = 27 mA cm−2) could achieve their theoretical photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE = 100% throughout their photoresponse region), a tandem cell composed of ZnFe2O4–CuFeO2 would achieve a solar-to-hydrogen (STH) conversion efficiency of ∼12% (Fig. 40a). However, as discussed so far, even current state-of-the-art ZnFe2O4 (ref. 84) and CuFeO2 (ref. 55 and 88) cannot realize unbiased tandem cells owing to their lack of sufficient photovoltage, especially for the photocathode side. For comparison with well-developed materials, an overall water splitting system of BiVO4 (Eg: 2.4 eV) − Cu2O (Eg: 2.1 eV)215 achieved STH of 3.0% and that of BiVO4 (Eg: 2.4 eV) − CIGS (Eg: 1.6 eV)216 achieved STH of 3.7%, where the BiVO4 photoanode produced Vph of 1.0 V and the Cu2O and CIGS photocathodes produced Vph of 1.0 V and 0.7 V, respectively. At the current early stage of development, we suggest that major efforts should be devoted to achieving higher Vph values of ferrite photoelectrodes.

Additional points are taken from the following references: BiFeO3,64 ZnFe2O4,59 CuFeO2,55 FeCrAlO3,58 CaFe2O4,63 Sb2Se3,217 TiO2,218 PSC (perovskite solar cell) (photocathode, buried),219 Cu2O,215 BiVO4.220 
For photovoltage, Mayer51 made a systematic comparison of light absorbers with plots of photovoltage vs. band gap for different photovoltaic cell configurations for photoelectrodes with a buried junction (also denoted as protected) or without protection (direct contact with water). A sum of the photovoltage over ∼1.23 V is needed to conduct unbiased solar overall water splitting. We modified his presentation for ferrite-based photoelectrodes in Fig. 40b. For example, CaFe2O4 and ZnFe2O4 have a photovoltage sum of 1.7 V (1.1 + 0.6), showing the possibility of realizing unbiased solar overall water splitting in a PEC cell. However, their achieved photocurrent densities are too low; thus, realizing a tandem cell with only ferrites has little practical significance at the current state of development.
5.2 Future perspective
As discussed so far, ferrites have unfavourable optical, electronic, and charge transport properties, which limits their overall STH conversion efficiency. A variety of modification strategies have been applied to improve their efficiency, including nanostructuring, doping, substrate engineering, post-treatment with a reductive gas and advanced annealing, which are found to be effective for other oxide-based photoelectrodes in general.221,222 It is necessary to develop new modification strategies that are particularly suitable for ferrite photoelectrodes. Here, we wish to mention a few such approaches.
First, the recently developed methodology to simulate the performance of a photoelectrode (IPCE)223 based on the basic optoelectronic properties of the material (diffusion length, carrier density, absorption coefficient, etc.) seems to be quite useful to identify the bottlenecks of individual ferrite materials and to design strategies to improve the performance of photoelectrodes. To do this, of course, those fundamental properties should be measured under conditions relevant to the real PEC water splitting reaction or, ideally, under operando conditions. Second, HMA seems to be a tailor-made fabrication method for ferrite photoelectrodes. The majority of ferrites have quite high formation temperatures (above 600 °C), sometimes exceeding the melting point of the material. HMA can be used to complete the synthesis in an extremely short time (a few min) while still supplying enough energy for the synthesis. As a result, high quality, crystalline ferrites can be produced in small sizes with little damage to the FTO substrate.224 Finally, nanostructuring is a general modification strategy that is applied widely to many kinds of materials; it has been found to be particularly effective for ferrite photoelectrodes with poor bulk charge transfer properties. Specifically, inverse opal (ZnFe2O4,85 Fe2TiO5,70 FeCrAlOx (ref. 58) and CuFeO2 (ref. 90)), and nanorod (ZnFe2O4 (ref. 54)) structures increased the light harvesting efficiency with relatively low thickness of the light absorber film. Because ferrites have low α values, a thick film is required for full absorption of photons with above-bandgap energies. However, increasing the thickness results in an elongated distance for charge carriers to travel and increased chance of recombination. Thus, nanostructuring that can improve the light harvesting efficiency without increasing the thickness of the light absorption layer is particularly effective for ferrite photoelectrodes.
Despite the low PEC performance of ferrite materials, they have many good attributes that merit further research and development. Earth-abundant elements, intrinsic stability, and promising photovoltages for some materials have already been discussed. In addition, ferrite-based semiconductors have a great degree of diversity and high compatibility of band gap engineering, with different conductivity types (n, p), compositions and crystal systems; this allows fine tuning by material design. In this regard, combinatorial synthesis and characterization of the elemental composition of a ferrite phase or a combination of different phases may be powerful tools to determine optimized phases or phase combinations. These materials can be used as particulate photocatalysts as well as photoelectrodes for PEC cells.225 In addition to overall water splitting, there are other applications that are similar but have different characteristics, such as CO2 reduction, partial oxidation and reduction for value-added chemical production;226 we believe that ferrite-based materials could have advantages in these applications. An application where the robustness of ferrites is useful is PEC splitting of inexpensive seawater. For instance, a BiVO4/NiFeOx photoanode227 showed performance in seawater similar to that in a neutral buffer solution. Ferrites with better stability than BiVO4 may be even better.
One reason for the low PEC performance of ferrite photoelectrodes is that the time spent on their development has not been long enough. Well-developed materials such as Fe2O3 and BiVO4 required ∼20 years to reach their current levels of performance, and their initial performance was not much better than that of ferrites.23,228 Hence, intensive research should be continued to achieve fundamental understanding of ferrite materials, development of ingenious synthetic methods, and improvement of their performance by various modification strategies in order to transform them into viable photoelectrodes. Especially, more research effort is needed to achieve photocathode application of ferrites, which has received relatively less attention.229,230 Fortunately, the tools and strategies proven useful to improve the performance of well-known oxide materials (hematite in particular) should be equally effective for ferrites, which may shorten the time required for development.

 	Fig. 4  A semiconductor–electrolyte junction under light illumination. Upon light illumination, the quasi-Fermi-level splits due to the excess concentration of photogenerated electron–hole pairs. Thus, the photovoltage (Vph) of the photoanode is determined by the difference of these two quasi-Fermi levels (Ef,n − Ef,p). The n-type metal oxide semiconductors like Fe2O3 (ref. 30) and BiVO4 (ref. 31) have this type of energy diagram, with a minority diffusion length (Lp) and depletion width (Lsc, often denoted as WD) of several nm.
