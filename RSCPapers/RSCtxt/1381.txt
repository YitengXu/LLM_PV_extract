    , Accepted 13th February 2018First published on 14th February 2018AbstractThe realization of one-dimensional nanostructures or Ti3+ self-doping in TiO2 photocatalysts has proven to be an effective approach for significantly improving their photocatalytic performance. Herein, a series of nonstoichiometric anatase TiO2 nanorod films were deposited at 50–500 °C by a facile one-step magnetron sputtering method. The correlation between the microstructures and the photocatalytic H2 production abilities of the films was studied. It is found that, by increasing the deposition temperature, the as-sputtered TiO2 grains transformed from quasi-spherical to rod-like structures while the concentration of the Ti3+ species decreased gradually. Thus, by virtue of the collaboration between nanostructure engineering and defect engineering, the sample deposited at 300 °C showed a maximum H2 generation rate of 1874 μmol m−2 h−1, which was about 134 times higher than that of a Degussa P25 powder film (14 μmol m−2 h−1). Furthermore, the stoichiometric TiO2 shell formed on the surface of TiO2 nanograins protected the defective TiO2−x core from further oxidation, resulting in an excellent photocatalytic stability of the films. The possible film growth and photocatalytic reaction mechanisms over the Ti3+ doped TiO2 nanorod films have been investigated. Our work provides a facile route to fabricating a high-efficiency defect-based TiO2 or other transition metal oxide nanostructures with a controlled morphology for solar energy conversion.
1. Introduction
Anatase TiO2 is one of the most promising and suitable photocatalytic materials due to its high chemical stability, low cost, and nontoxicity.1,2 However, the easy recombination of photoinduced carriers and the insufficiency of optical absorption result in its low photocatalytic activity.3 In order to overcome these disadvantages, various effective strategies have been developed.3–7 It is widely believed that the photocatalytic performance of TiO2 is closely related to its grain morphology.5,8 Recent studies have demonstrated that one-dimensional (1-D) nanostructures such as nanowires, nanorods, and nanotubes may exhibit excellent photocatalytic activities, as they can promote the transfer of photogenerated electrons by providing direct transferring pathways and restrict the recombination of electron–hole pairs when compared with the TiO2 nanoparticle networks.6
Besides that, another well-known approach is doping with metal or non-metal elements that can tune the electronic structure of TiO2 and thereby introduce new states into the TiO2 band gap for visible-light absorption.6,7 For example, doping with metal elements (Fe, Cr, Cu, etc.) could build donor states below the conduction band (CB), while doping with non-metal elements (C, N, F, S, etc.) would create acceptor states above the valence band (VB).9,10 However, the hetero-doping of TiO2 also produces lattice defects, which unavoidably introduce new photocarrier recombination centers, resulting in a negative effect on the catalytic performance in the UV region.10,11 The latest studies suggest that the configuration of Ti3+ or oxygen vacancies (Ov) in the TiO2 lattice can also result in the formation of local states at the CB bottom of TiO2.3,12 Hence, such Ti3+ self-doped TiO2 achieves its visible-light absorption performance and eliminates the recombination effect from doped impurities.13 In addition, Ti3+ defects can act as electron capture agents to increase the electrical conductivity of TiO2 and accelerate the transfer of photogenerated carriers.14,15
Substantial progress on morphology engineering and self-doping has been made in preparing TiO2-based materials. To date, there are various ways reported to introducing Ti3+ and Ov into TiO2, but only a few of harsh, tedious and expensive methods could be used for preparing chemically stable TiO2−x, such as high-temperature and high-pressure hydrogenation, and electron beam irradiation.7,16–18 Thus, it is urgently desired to develop the one-step synthesis of the in situ Ti3+ self-doping 1-D nanostructures of TiO2 for enhanced photocatalytic performance. Sputtering is a typical industry-friendly thin-film process. It is expected that vacuum activation can restrain the formation of surficial Ti3+.10,19 More importantly, the microstructures of the films could be presented as a function of substrate temperatures while sputtering metal elements under an oxygen atmosphere.20
Herein, we successfully fabricated a series of nonstoichiometric TiO2 nanorod films by a one-step magnetron sputtering method and found that their morphologies and Ti3+ concentrations can be regulated by changing the deposition temperatures in the range from 50 to 500 °C. The possible film growth mechanism was studied. Then, the photocatalytic H2 production ability was investigated by immersing the films in a 10% aqueous methanol solution. It is revealed that the sample deposited at 300 °C showed an optimal H2 generation rate of 1874 μmol m−2 h−1, which was two orders of magnitude higher than that of the Degussa P25 powder film. This is ascribed to the collaboration between its 1-D nanorod structures and Ti3+ self-doping. Furthermore, it also showed excellent photocatalytic stability after a long-term usage, resulting from the intact stoichiometric TiO2 shell formed on the surface.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Fabrication of TiO2 thin films
TiO2 thin films were grown on quartz glass substrates (2 × 4 cm) by radio frequency (RF) reactive magnetron sputtering. The target was a ceramic plate of rutile TiO2 (99.99% pure), 2 inches in diameter (Fig. S1†). The base vacuum was 4.9 × 10−3 Pa and the working gas was Ar (99.999% pure). The target–substrate distance was constant at 110 mm. Before the deposition, the target was pre-sputtered with an argon plasma for 20 min. During the deposition process, the substrate was rotated at 8 rpm along its axis. The samples deposited with substrate temperatures of 50, 200, 300, 400, and 500 °C were named T-50, T-200, T-300, T-400, and T-500, respectively. For all the samples, the RF power, total working pressure, and Ar flow rate were set at 130 W, 0.4 Pa, and 40 sccm (standard cubic centimeters per minute), respectively. The whole deposition was carried out for 4 h. After the deposition, the samples were annealed in air at 400 °C for 1 h. For comparison, a Degussa P25 powder film with a thickness of ∼1 μm was prepared by spin-coating.
2.2 Characterization
The crystalline structure of the TiO2 films was identified by X-ray diffraction (XRD) (Miniflex600, Rigaku, Japan), and the morphology was characterized by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) (SU8010, Hitachi, Japan) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) (JEM-2010, JEOL, Japan). The absorption spectra of the films were recorded using a UV-Vis spectrophotometer (Lambda 900, PerkinElmer, USA). Surface analyses were performed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (ESCALAB 250, Thermo Scientific, USA). The low temperature electron paramagnetic resonance spectra (EPR) were recorded using an electron paramagnetic resonance spectrometer (Elexsys E500, Bruker, Germany) at 100 K. The photoluminescence (PL) spectra were obtained using a luminescence spectrometer (FLS980, Edinburgh Instruments, UK) at room temperature.
2.3 Photocatalytic activity testing
Hydrogen generation was tested using a photocatalytic water splitting testing system (CEL-SPH2N, AULTT, China). The sample was dipped in 100 mL aqueous solution containing 10 vol% methanol in a quartz cell. The solution was purged with argon gas for 20 min, and then the gas in the quartz cell was removed by mechanical pumping for 1 h. The light source was a 300 W Xe lamp fixed at 15 cm above the film. The amount of H2 generation under the continuous irradiation of the Xe lamp was determined using a gas chromatograph (SP7800, AULTT, China) using Ar as a carrier gas.
3. Results and discussion
To identify the crystal phase and structures of the TiO2 films, XRD was carried out, and the results are shown in Fig. 1. It is found that, except for the amorphous sample T-50, all the other as-sputtered samples (T-200–T-500) were of the pure anatase phase. The diffraction peaks located at 2θ = 25.30°, 37.79°, 38.57°, 55.06°, and 70.29°, can be indexed to the (101), (004), (112), (211) and (220) diffraction planes of anatase TiO2, respectively (according to JCPDS card no. 99-0008).21 Obviously, by increasing the deposition temperature, the as-sputtered TiO2 films transformed from the amorphous phase to the crystalline phase. After annealing in air at 400 °C for 1 h, the crystallinities of the samples deposited at lower temperatures (≤300 °C) increased greatly, while the diffraction patterns of the samples deposited at 400–500 °C remained nearly unchanged, as shown in Fig. 1b.

Fig. 2 shows the SEM images of the TiO2 films deposited at different temperatures. As shown in the cross-section images (Fig. 2f–j), the film thicknesses of the as-sputtered samples T-50, T-200, T-300, T-400, and T-500 were about 860, 880, 900, 910 and 930 nm, respectively, which are close to each other. Besides this, it is noticed that the as-sputtered sample T-50 was composed of randomly interconnected quasi-spherical nanoparticles with a highly compact surface (Fig. 2a and f). Upon increasing the deposition temperature, the TiO2 grain sizes increased gradually, and the film surface became more and more loose (Fig. 2a–e); rod-like crystals were observed in the samples deposited at higher temperatures and the content ratio of nanorods to nanoparticles increased gradually. For sample T-500, the film was totally composed of nanorods grown on glass substrates (Fig. 2j). After annealing at 400 °C for 1 h, the morphologies of all the samples remained unchanged, as shown in Fig. S2.†

The morphologies and microstructures of the TiO2 films were also observed in the TEM and HRTEM images. As seen in Fig. 3a and c, the annealed T-50 was composed of disorderly compacted nanoparticles, while the as-sputtered T-500 consisted of orderly nanorods with an average diameter of ∼30 nm. Fig. 3b shows the HRTEM image of the annealed T-50; it reveals that the annealed T-50 was polycrystalline and the appearance of a ring corresponding to the diffraction from the (004) planes indicated the formation of anatase TiO2, which matched well with the results from its XRD spectrum. In Fig. 3d, it is clear that the nanorods in the as-sputtered T-500 were single crystals, and their perfect continuous two-dimensional atomic lattices with spacings of 0.35 nm and 0.23 nm, corresponded to the (101) and (112) planes of anatase TiO2, respectively.

The divergence in the crystalline structures and morphologies of the samples can mainly be attributed to the different deposition processes of incident atoms at different substrate temperatures:22,23 the incident atoms which reached the substrate surface would transfer kinetic energy to the lattice and became loosely bonded adatoms, then these adatoms diffused over the surface to exchange energy with the lattice and other adsorbed atoms, until they were desorbed or, more commonly, trapped at low-energy lattice sites. Finally, the incorporated atoms readjusted their positions within the lattice by bulk diffusion processes. When the film was deposited at a low temperature of ∼50 °C, incident atoms were insufficient to overcome the energy barrier between the rough substrate surface and the incident angular directions due to their low activation energy.24 Thus, T-50 was poorly defined with a high dislocation density, and consisted of quasi-spherical grains separated by voided boundaries (Fig. 4a). For a film deposited at moderate temperatures (200–400 °C), the growth was dominated by adatom surface diffusion and the film was mainly composed of columnar shaped crystallites with dense inter-crystalline boundaries (Fig. 4b).25 At a high deposition temperature of ∼500 °C, high surface diffusion was the dominant process; thus the film grew into needles with porous layers (Fig. 4c).23 If a higher deposition temperature of the film was set, the growth was dominantly influenced by bulk self-diffusion; meanwhile, recrystallization occurred.22 The grain diameters increased with the deposition temperature and the film consisted of equiaxed grains (Fig. S3†).26 Moreover, it has been reported that the film recognized by crystallites with open boundaries is not influenced by heat treatment at moderate temperatures.22 Therefore, the sample morphology remains almost unchanged after annealing at 400 °C, although the crystallinities of the samples T-50–T-300 were obviously enhanced (Fig. 1b).

The light harvesting capacity is a key factor for photocatalytic water splitting. Fig. 5 shows the photographs and absorption spectra of the TiO2 samples before and after annealing. The as-sputtered samples were yellow-brown (Fig. 5a). Particularly, samples T-200 and T-300 seemed to be greyish black, and consistently, their absorptions in the visible-light region were obviously higher than those of the others (Fig. 5a, c and e). Brown coloration has been previously reported in reduced TiO2−x and was characteristic of free electrons in the CB of TiO2 resulting from Ti3+ or Ov.10,15,27–29 Upon increasing the growth temperature from 200 to 500 °C, the as-sputtered samples became more transparent and their absorption in the visible-light region declined gradually (Fig. 5e). After annealing in air, Ti3+ and Ov in the samples diffused from the bulk to the surface which diluted the “color centers”; therefore the samples were more transparent compared to the as-sputtered colors (Fig. 5b, d and f). Moreover, it's worth noting that there was an obvious inverse correlation between the reduction in absorption in the visible-light region and their growth temperatures (Fig. S4†), which further confirmed that the concentrations of Ti3+ and Ov in the as-sputtered samples were dependent on the deposited temperature.

XPS is only sensitive up to ∼5 nm beneath the top surface layer of the sample. The surface chemical states of the as-sputtered films are investigated by XPS techniques and are shown in Fig. 6a. Obviously, the Ti 2p XPS spectra of the as-sputtered samples T-200–T-500 were almost completely comparable, suggesting the existence of identical surface states of Ti in these samples. The two peaks located at about 458.8 and 464.6 eV corresponding to the characteristics of Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2 peaks were observed, which are ascribed to the presence of the Ti4+ species.30,31 Besides that, it is clear that the peaks were highly symmetric and there were no detectable shoulder peaks at ∼462.5 eV, indicating an absolute coordination of Ti4+ in the surfaces of the films.10 It is widely believed that surficial Ti3+ is easily oxidized by O2 in air or dissolved oxygen in water, and thus the surficial Ti3+ will be consumed rapidly.32 To further examine the chemical states of the as-sputtered films, EPR spectroscopy measurement was conducted (Fig. 6b). The samples T-200–T-500 exhibited a small signal at g = 2.004 and an intense EPR signal at around g = 1.94, which correspond to an oxygen vacancy and Ti3+, respectively.3,33 From the EPR analyses, it can also be deduced that Ti3+ in the as-sputtered samples mainly existed in the bulk, as the surficial Ti3+ would tend to adsorb atmospheric O2 and then produce the O2− species, which shows an EPR signal at g ≈ 2.02.12,33 The absence of such a peak in Fig. 6b indicates that Ti3+ was only present in the bulk, which is a key factor for the observed excellent stability of the samples.12,34,35 As we soaked the films in water for 6 months, their colors remained the same, indicating the excellent stability of Ti3+ in our samples. These results also demonstrated that a stoichiometric TiO2 nanoshell was formed on the surfaces of nonstoichiometric Ti3+-doped TiO2 nanocrystals. Furthermore, the signal intensities of Ti3+ and Ov decreased by increasing the preparation temperature. As the intensity signal of EPR verifies the amount of unpaired electrons,36 it is concluded once again that there is a negative correlation between the Ti3+/Ov concentration and deposition temperature. This temperature-dependent defect-management can be understood in a way that the higher preparation temperature promoted the entropy-driven diffusion of Ti3+ defects in the subsurface of the films toward the inner bulk region, as there was no surface adsorbed oxygen during the preparation process under an inert gas atmosphere that resulted in an insufficient dynamic driving force supply.32

Photocatalytic reactivity for H2 evolution was evaluated in an aqueous methanol solution under Xe lamp irradiation for 12 h, and the H2 generation rate of the TiO2 films before and after annealing is given in Fig. 7a. Since excess crystal defects may cause serious recombination of photogenerated carriers, the amorphous T-50 was undoubtedly incapable of generating H2, while the film deposited at a moderate temperature of 300 °C (T-300) showed the highest H2 generation rate of 1874 μmol m−2 h−1, which was about 134 times higher than that of the Degussa P25 powder film (14 μmol m−2 h−1). The H2 generation activity of the as-sputtered T-300 was higher than those of the samples deposited at lower temperatures (<300 °C) and even exceeded that of the sample deposited at a high temperature of 500 °C. Such anomalous behavior can be ascribed to the balance between the Ti3+/Ov concentration and grain morphology. When the growth temperature was increased, on one hand, the shape of the TiO2 grains changed from quasi-spherical to rod-like gradually, which was beneficial to the photocatalytic ability because 1-D nanorod structures can provide direct transferring pathways for photogenerated carriers that avoid carriers hopping between particle and particle.5,21 On the other hand, increasing the substrate temperatures decreased the concentration of Ti3+ and Ov that inhibited the photocatalytic efficiency. As has been reported, the doping of Ti3+ and Ov introduces continuous states in the band gap of TiO2, which act as an electron reservoir to capture photoelectrons. In this way, the introduction of Ti3+/Ov in TiO2 prolongs the conduction life of the photo-induced electrons and hinders the recombination of electrons and holes, resulting in an obviously enhanced photocatalytic activity of TiO2.3,15,37

It is well known that Ti3+ and Ov in the samples can be largely eliminated by annealing in air. As shown in Fig. 7a, except for the amorphous T-50, the H2 generation rates of all the samples dropped after annealing (about 35%, 71%, 58%, and 53% for T-200, T-300, T-400 and T-500, respectively). As aforementioned, the lower the sample preparation temperature was, the higher Ov and Ti3+ concentrations were formed; therefore the sample deposited at lower temperatures will suffer from an stronger inhibitory effect on its photocatalytic yield after annealing treatment. Moreover, the annealing treatment could also greatly improve the crystallinities of the samples prepared at low temperatures such as samples T-50 and T-200; thus less reduction in activity was detected for the annealed T-200, and the annealed T-50 showed certain ability to generate H2.
We also carried out the cycling photocatalytic experiment of H2 generation over the as-sputtered T-300, as shown in Fig. 7b. The result indicates that the as-sputtered film can still maintain high catalytic efficiency after the five-cycle reaction without an obvious decrease in activity, suggesting the excellent stability of Ti3+/Ov in our samples. This is due to the unique crystalline structure of the TiO2 nanocrystals, which was composed of an intact shell (TiO2) and a defective and disordered core (TiO2−x). The stoichiometric TiO2 shell effectively prevented the oxidation reaction between the Ti3+ and dissolved oxygen in water, thereby allowing a long-term usage. Furthermore, the XRD patterns (Fig. S5†) of the as-sputtered films after 12 h of photoreactions were essentially similar to those of the original, and there were no observable changes of the peak intensities, further indicating the stability of the samples after the light irradiation.
To gain insight into the photoinduced carrier recombination, the photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the as-sputtered TiO2 films were obtained which are shown in Fig. 7c. When the as-sputtered samples were excited at 360 nm at room temperature, a main emission at 390–480 nm was observed. The intensity of the PL emission followed the order: T-400 > T-500 > T-200 > T-300. It is well known that a lower PL intensity is generally indicative of a lower recombination rate of photogenerated electron–hole pairs.30,33,38 Therefore, on the basis of the PL result, it is deduced that the highest photocatalytic activity of the as-sputtered sample T-300 was well-correlated with its much lower electron–hole recombination, revealing the significantly promoted charge-separation efficiency of the sample.39
The possible photocatalytic mechanisms of H2 generation over Ti3+ self-doped TiO2 nanorod films were proposed, as shown in Fig. 7d. It is well known that the presence of Ti3+ and Ov in TiO2 would introduce additional levels below the conduction band. Meanwhile, by increasing the concentration of the defects, these levels overlap with the conduction band.40–42 Under light irradiation, some of the electrons in the VB jumped to a defect energy level and then transferred to the CB of TiO2, while some of the other photoelectrons were directly excited to the CB of TiO2. Finally, the electrons in the CB of TiO2 transferred to surface H+ along the growth direction of the nanorods or lateral surface H+ with a very short diffusion distance, for H2 generation. In turn, the generated holes in the VB were consumed by methanol oxidation. Thus, we could conclude that Ti3+/Ov and 1D nanostructures played significant roles in improving the photocatalytic H2 generation activity from water splitting.
4. Conclusions
A series of nonstoichiometric TiO2 nanorod films were fabricated by a one-step magnetron sputtering method and their photocatalytic H2 generation activities for water splitting were evaluated in an aqueous methanol solution. It is found that the TiO2 grain morphologies and Ti3+ concentration in the TiO2 film can be regulated through a simple adjustment of the preparation temperature. While benefiting from the balance between the Ti3+/Ov concentration and 1-D nanostructure, the film deposited at a moderate temperature of 300 °C showed an optimal H2 generation rate of 1874 μmol m−2 h−1. Besides this, the location of the Ti3+ defects can be effectively controlled predominately in the subsurface/bulk regions of the TiO2 film which ensures the stability of the film in a long-term usage. The present work provides a simple efficient approach to preparing stable TiO2 photocatalysts with adjustable nanostructures and self-doping concentrations, which can be potentially applied in the optimization of other transition metal oxide photocatalysts/electrocatalysts in energy conversion fields.
