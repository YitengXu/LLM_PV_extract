    , Accepted 15th February 2023First published on 10th March 2023AbstractFabrication of a NaNbO3/SnS2/Cu2O heterostructure was undertaken for the application of photoelectrochemical water-splitting. A type-II band alignment for charge carrier migration (i.e., electrons and holes) provided a high rate of charge transfer at the interface of the heterostructure, which aided prevention of photocorrosion and broadened the absorption range from the ultraviolet region to the visible region. Type-II band alignment was created in a NaNbO3/SnS2 heterojunction. Another type-II band alignment was formed in SnS2/Cu2O with a n–p-type heterojunction. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) plots of the NaNbO3/SnS2/Cu2O heterostructure showed higher photocurrent density at a low onset potential. Mott–Schottky plots confirmed formation of a n–n–p heterojunction in the composition of NaNbO3/SnS2/Cu2O, which helps to lower the recombination rate of charge carriers. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) suggested a smaller value of charge transfer resistance of the NaNbO3/SnS2/Cu2O heterostructure; these data supported the evidence that migration of charge carriers was much more favorable in the designed heterostructure, which exhibited higher activity towards photoelectrochemical water-splitting.
1 Introduction
The increasing demand for energy and maintaining a pollution-free environment are great challenges for sustainable development of the world.1 Hydrogen is considered to be an “ideal” fuel for the future because it is clean, safe, renewable, carbon-free, and environmentally friendly because it produces only water after combustion.2 Hydrogen is perceived to meet the energy demands of the future and solve environmental problems.3 Hydrogen production using a semiconductor photocatalyst has received much attention in the research of water-splitting to solve the problem of producing energy in an environmentally friendly way.4,5 Researchers have focused efforts into developing greener and more cost-effective photocatalysts for energy conversion and storage devices such as fuel cells,6 supercapacitors,7 battery materials,8 and water-splitting electrolyzers.9 Water-splitting through solar energy is one of the most suitable and eco-friendly methods to produce hydrogen as an energy fuel.9 In 1972, Fujishima and Honda reported, for the first time, the splitting of water towards hydrogen generation using solar energy by a semiconductor photocatalyst (TiO2).10 The bandgap of TiO2 is ∼3.2 eV and lies in the ultraviolet (UV) region, from which 4% of the solar energy available on Earth arises.11,12 Many other semiconductor photocatalysts have been discovered in an attempt to increase the efficiency of solar-to-hydrogen (STH) conversion. To improve the STH efficiency, the light-absorption range must be extended into the visible region, from which 43% of solar energy available on Earth arises.13–15
Metal-oxide photocatalysts are among the most promising catalyst candidates for hydrogen production via the water-splitting process.16 Many outstanding photocatalysts, such as ZnO,17 Cu2O,18 ZnS,19 CdS,20 NaNbO3,21 SrTiO3,22 SnO2,23 and Fe2O3,24 have been discovered. Some of them have wide bandgap that lie in the UV region. Some of them have narrow bandgaps that lie in the visible region, and are more suitable for promoting the water-splitting reaction. Cuprous oxide (Cu2O) is a p-type oxide semiconductor that has attracted a lot of attention because it is Earth-abundant, inexpensive, as well as having low toxicity, and excellent electrochemical properties.25 Cu2O exists in various morphologies,26–33 has a narrow bandgap (1.6–2.4 eV),34 and has unique optical,35 electrical,36 and magnetic properties.37 Cu2O is widely applicable in various fields, such as batteries,38 thin-film transistors (TFT),39 gas sensors,40,41 supercapacitors,42 lithium-ion batteries,38 catalysis,43 as well as photovoltaic (PV),44 photocatalytic45 and photoelectrochemical46 water-splitting applications. The main drawback arises in the photostability of Cu2O due to the self-decomposition of photogenerated charge carriers, which obstructs the overall performance of the photocatalyst.47 Modifying the surface of the photocatalyst by hybridizing with the co-catalyst,48,49 modifying the crystal structure by changing the size and morphology of the photocatalyst,50,51 doping with heteroatoms,52 combining with carbon-based materials53–57 as well as the fabrication of core–shell heterojunctions58,59 are approaches for preventing the photocatalyst undergoing photocorrosion. These methods help to reduce photocorrosion by decreasing interactions between charge carriers and the oxide/sulfide ions in the photocatalyst.60–62 Aguirre and co-workers reported that TiO2 protects Cu2O (octahedral morphology) against photocorrosion by forming a Cu2O/TiO2 heterostructure, which led to a 4-fold increase in the CO2 photoreduction rate when compared with that of pure Cu2O.63 Zheng et al. studied the Z scheme-based WO3/Cu2O heterojunction that prevents Cu2O photocorrosion and leads to extremely efficient PEC performance.64 Zhou et al. designed a FeOOH/Cu2O composite system in which FeOOH acts as a hole-transfer layer that aids in the acceleration of holes from the interior of Cu2O. This action limits Cu2O self-oxidation and, therefore, enhances the photoelectrochemical stability and activity of the Cu2O electrode.65 Li et al. reported that Cu2O was protected from photocorrosion by covering p-Cu2O/n-TiO2 nanotube arrays with ZnO. Results showed that the ternary heterojunction n-ZnO/p-Cu2O/n-TNA had good photo-electrocatalytic activity, stability, and reliability.66 Fu et al. studies the 2D/2D CdS/SnS2 heterostructure (CSHS) to achieve a highly efficient photocatalytic water-splitting nanostructure.67 The studies stated above indicate that a photocatalyst may be prevented from undergoing photocorrosion if a composite or core/shell heterojunction is created, which would help to improve the activity and stability of the photocatalyst.
We chose sodium niobate (NaNbO3) because it is non-toxic in nature, chemically stable, can be synthesized readily, has high crystallinity, and is utilized widely in photocatalytic and photoelectrochemical water-splitting applications. NaNbO3 has the advantage of having a relatively high efficiency of electron transfer during the photocatalytic process,68 thereby making it a suitable photocatalyst for the water-splitting application. Herein, we designed a ternary composite heterostructure of NaNbO3/SnS2/Cu2O as a suitable photocatalyst. It lowered the rate at which charge carriers recombine and enhanced the overall activity and stability of the photocatalyst towards photoelectrochemical water-splitting applications.
2 Experimental section
2.1 Synthesis of NaNbO3
A hydrothermal method was used for the synthesis of NaNbO3.69 Nb2O5 (2 g) was dissolved in NaOH (10 N) solution in 60 mL of double-distilled (DD) water and stirred for 2 h. CTAB (500 mg) was added to the solution, which was stirred for another 4 h before hydrothermal treatment in a 100 mL Teflon™-coated autoclave at 170 °C for 48 h. The sample was centrifuged and washed 3–4 times with DD water, washed with ethanol and then dried overnight in an oven at 50 °C.
2.2 Synthesis of Cu2O
Cu2O was synthesized using the sol–gel method70 with CuSO4·5H2O, CTAB, NaOH, and glucose as precursors. We prepared a solution of CuSO4·5H2O (0.5 M) and CTAB (0.01 M) in 15 mL of DD water, and stirred for 15 min. In another beaker, we added glucose (0.5 M) in 2 mL of DD water and NaOH (1 M) in 8 mL of DD water, transferred it to the mixture stated above, and heated it at 80 °C for 2 h with constant stirring. After allowing the solution to cool to room temperature, the sample was centrifuged and washed 3–4 times with DD water, washed with ethanol, and then dried overnight in an oven at 50 °C.
2.3 Synthesis of SnS2
The sol–gel method was used to synthesize SnS2 using SnCl4·5H2O, C2H5NS, and conc. HCl as precursors. A mixture of SnCl4·5H2O (2 mmol) and 2 mL of conc. HCl were mixed in 30 mL of DD water, and stirred for 20 min. Then, thioacetamide (2 mmol) was added, stirred further for another 3 h, and then 18 mL of DD water was poured into the reaction mixture. The final solution was kept at room temperature for 30 min. The sample was centrifuged and washed 3–4 times with DD water, washed with ethanol, and dried overnight in an oven at 50 °C.
2.4 Synthesis of NaNbO3/SnS2
The sol–gel method was used to synthesize a heterostructure of NaNbO3/SnS2. For the synthesis of the NaNbO3/SnS2 heterostructure, 3-mercaptopropionic acid (3-MPA) was used as a surface-functionalizing agent.71 Already synthesized NaNbO3 (as described above) was dispersed in 60 mL of DD water, after which we added 3-MPA (20 μL) to the solution, which was stirred for 2 h. In another beaker, a solution of SnCl4·5H2O (2 mmol) and conc. HCl (2 mL) in 30 mL of DD water was stirred for 1 h and then poured into the beaker stated above, in which NaNbO3 was dispersed and stirred for next 1 h. Then, thioacetamide solution (3 mmol) was added to the reaction mixture and stirred again for another 3 h. The sample was centrifuged and washed 3–4 times with DD water, washed with ethanol, and then dried overnight in an oven at 50 °C.
2.5 Synthesis of NaNbO3/SnS2/Cu2O
To synthesize the NaNbO3/SnS2/Cu2O heterostructure, we dispersed the already synthesized NaNbO3/SnS2 in 60 mL of DD water, added 20 μL of 3-MPA, and stirred for 2 h. We prepared a solution of CuSO4·5H2O (0.5 M) and CTAB (0.01 M) in 15 mL of DD water in another beaker, heated for 30 min at 80 °C. Next, we transferred this solution to the mixture stated above (in which NaNbO3/SnS2 was dispersed), stirred for another 30 min, then added glucose solution and NaOH solution (1 M). We heated the reaction mixture at 80 °C for 2 h, with constant stirring. After allowing the sample to cool naturally, it was centrifuged and washed 3–4 times with DD water before being rinsed with ethanol and dried overnight in an oven at 50 °C.
2.6 Characterization
The phase composition, purity, and lattice parameters of all synthesized samples were analyzed by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) analysis on a diffractometer (D8 Advance; Bruker) equipped with Ni-filtered Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å) in the 2Θ range of 10–80° at a scan rate of 0.02° s−1. The surface morphology and elemental mapping of synthesized samples were determined by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) using a Magna instrument (Tescan) functioning at an accelerating voltage of 50 kV equipped with an energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy detector for elemental mapping. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements were made to gain detailed insight into the morphology of synthesized heterostructures using an electron microscope (Technai G2 20; FEI) running at 200 kV. Diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) was carried out using a spectrophotometer (UV-2401; Shimadzu) with an integrating sphere accessory and BaSO4 as a diffuse reflectance standard in the range of 300 nm to 800 nm. X-ray photoelectron microscopy (XPS) measurements were made using an instrument from Kratos Analytical (AXIS Supra) with a monochromatic X-ray source (Al Kα) at 1486.6 eV.
2.7 Photoelectrochemical studies
Photoelectrochemical experiments were performed on a workstation (PGSTAT204; AutoLab) with catalyst-coated indium tin oxide (ITO) as the working electrode, Ag/AgCl (sat. KCl) as the reference electrode, and platinum wire as the counter electrode in a solution containing Na2SO4 (0.5 M) as the electrolyte (pH = 7). The electrode material paste was prepared by sonicating 3 mg of photocatalyst with isopropanol (IPA) solution (dispersant) and Nafion (binder) in a 4:1 ratio. The electrode-paste was drop-cast on an ITO glass substrate (active area = 1 × 1 cm2) and dried at room temperature. An external xenon lamp (300 W) with a power density of 100 mW cm−2 was used as a light source under simulated solar irradiation (AM 1.5 G). Current density–voltage (J–V) characterization (i.e., linear sweep voltammetry (LSV)), transient photocurrent response (TPR) studies, Mott–Schottky (M–S) plots, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were performed in the three-electrode electrochemical workstation.
3 Results and discussion
3.1 Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD)
The crystallinity, phase composition, and purity of all synthesized samples were determined using PXRD. Fig. 1 depicts the PXRD patterns of synthesized samples as NaNbO3, Cu2O, SnS2, NaNbO3/SnS2, and NaNbO3/SnS2/Cu2O heterostructures. The characteristic PXRD peaks of NaNbO3 closely matched with the orthorhombic phase of NaNbO3 (JCPDS number: 895173). The diffraction peaks of Cu2O were identical to that of the cubic phase (JCPDS number: 653288). The characteristic PXRD peaks of SnS2 were well matched to the hexagonal phase of SnS2 (JCPDS number: 750367). Lattice parameters were calculated for the synthesized photocatalysts: NaNbO3 (a = 5.48 Å, b = 5.55 Å, c = 15.45 Å), SnS2 (a = b = 3.62 Å, c = 5.83 Å), and Cu2O (a = b = c = 4.23 Å). In the heterostructure NaNbO3/SnS2, diffraction peaks representing the hexagonal phase of SnS2 and the orthorhombic phase of NaNbO3 were observed. The PXRD patterns of the NaNbO3/SnS2/Cu2O heterostructure revealed the characteristic diffraction peaks of NaNbO3, SnS2, and Cu2O, thereby showing that the heterostructure had been formed. The two most intense diffraction peaks of NaNbO3 were observed in the diffraction pattern of NaNbO3, NaNbO3/SnS2, and NaNbO3/SnS2/Cu2O, respectively, at 2Θ values of 32.4° and 22.6° with corresponding Miller indices (hkl) of (114) and (110). In the case of NaNbO3/SnS2 and NaNbO3/SnS2/Cu2O, the peak intensity decreased, indicating the formation of a heterostructure. The most intense PXRD peak of SnS2 was observed in NaNbO3/SnS2 and NaNbO3/SnS2/Cu2O heterostructures at a 2Θ value of 15.13° with a Miller index of (001). In the PXRD pattern of Cu2O as well as the diffraction pattern of the NaNbO3/SnS2/Cu2O heterostructure, a major intense peak of Cu2O at a 2Θ value of 36.5° with a Miller index of (111) was observed. Additional peaks were not seen in the heterostructure, indicating that the compositions were formed without impurities.

3.2 Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)
The surface morphology and elemental mapping of all synthesized samples were examined with the help of FESEM. A small amount of the synthesized sample was dispersed in ethanol and drop-cast on a coverslip, which was then placed onto conductive carbon tape mounted on an aluminum stub. FESEM was carried out at a magnification of ×20000. Fig. 2(a)–(e) show the FESEM images of NaNbO3, Cu2O, SnS2, NaNbO3/SnS2, and NaNbO3/SnS2/Cu2O, respectively. Bare NaNbO3 particles showed a uniform cube-like morphology with a smooth surface and average size of 1 μm. Cu2O particles had a rod-like morphology. SnS2 particles showed a dendritic morphology. Fig. 2(d) reveals SnS2 nanoparticles deposited on the surface of NaNbO3 and forming a NaNbO3/SnS2 heterostructure. Fig. 2(e) depicts the surface morphology of a large NaNbO3/SnS2/Cu2O heterostructure with an outer coating of SnS2 and Cu2O particles. For TEM studies, a small amount of sample was dispersed in ethanol and ultrasonicated for 30 min before being drop-cast onto a carbon-coated, 300-mesh nickel grid. Fig. 2(f)–(j) show the TEM images of all synthesized samples. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) was used to obtain a high-quality image of the interface of the heterostructure. Images were captured using a high-resolution transmission electron microscope (Technai G2 20; FEI) at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV (Fig. S1 in ESI†). Fig. S1(a) (ESI†) shows a HRTEM image of a NaNbO3/SnS2/Cu2O heterostructure with a cube morphology of NaNbO3 covered with two outer layers: one thick layer of SnS2 and one thin layer of Cu2O. Fig. S1(b) (ESI†) demonstrates the fringes of crystalline NaNbO3 (114), SnS2 (001), and Cu2O (111) formed by a heterostructure with a lattice spacing of 0.27 nm, 0.58 nm, and 0.24 nm.

3.3 Energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy
The FESEM instrument was equipped with an EDX system with the potential of performing a point EDS scan from the edge and center of heterostructures to further confirm the elemental composition and distribution of elements in the NaNbO3/SnS2/Cu2O heterostructure. A rectangular area selected from the FESEM image for elemental mapping is shown in Fig. 3: all the elements (Na, Nb, O, Sn, S, and Cu) were present in the composition.

3.4 Diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS)
DRS was used to investigate the light-absorption characteristics of as-prepared samples. DRS measurements were taken on a spectrophotometer (UV-2401; Shimadzu) to calculate the bandgap of synthesized samples using BaSO4 as a diffuse reflectance standard in a wavelength range of 300 nm to 800 nm. The optical absorption spectra and optical bandgap of synthesized samples can be displayed and characterized using a Tauc plot using the Tauc equation:72 (1.1)where α = absorption coefficient, h = Planck's constant, ν = vibration frequency, Eg = bandgap of the synthesized sample, and n represents the nature of electronic transitions (with n = 1/2 for direct allowed transitions and n = 2 for indirect allowed transitions).

Fig. 4(a) depicts the diffuse reflectance spectra of NaNbO3, SnS2, Cu2O, NaNbO3/SnS2, and NaNbO3/SnS2/Cu2O heterostructures. Bare NaNbO3 cubes exhibited a distinct absorption edge in the UV region at 361 nm, which corresponded to a bandgap of 3.43 eV caused by electron transfer from the valence band to the conduction band. Forming heterostructures with SnS2 and NaNbO3 cubes caused a significant red-shift in the absorption spectra of NaNbO3 owing to the interfacial bonding between NaNbO3 cubes and the SnS2 shell.73 This transformation was visible by the naked eye due to a color change in the sample from white (for NaNbO3) to yellow (for NaNbO3/SnS2) and supported by bandgap estimation using the Tauc plot. The color of the sample changed to orange–red when Cu2O was coupled with NaNbO3/SnS2 and formed a ternary heterostructure of NaNbO3/SnS2/Cu2O, (inset of Fig. 4(a)). We assumed that the photocatalysts NaNbO3, SnS2, and Cu2O were direct bandgap semiconductors because linear behavior in the Tauc plot was noticed for all of these photocatalysts with exponent n = 1/2 (which corresponded to a direct transition). The bandgap of all synthesized samples (NaNbO3, SnS2, Cu2O, NaNbO3/SnS2, and NaNbO3/SnS2/Cu2O heterostructures) was estimated from the Tauc plot (Fig. 4(b)), and values (in eV) of 3.43, 2.07, 2.5, 2.04, and 2.02, respectively, were documented. Tauc plots demonstrated, for the heterostructures, absorption-edge shifts to a higher wavelength towards the visible region with each shell formation.

We can calculate the band-edge positions of the semiconductor photocatalyst using the following empirical formula:74 ECB = X + E0 − 0.5Eg(1.2) EVB = ECB + Eg(1.3)where the conduction band (CB) and valence band (VB) edge positions are represented by ECB and EVB, respectively. X is the electronegativity of the semiconductor, which is calculated by the following formula75[(A)aX(B)bX(C)c]1/(a+b+c)where E0 is the scaling factor (−4.5 eV for a normal hydrogen electrode) and Eg is the bandgap of the semiconductor. The calculated X value (in eV) for NaNbO3, Cu2O and SnS2 was 5.73, 3.99, and 4.57, respectively. From the empirical formula, we computed the edge position of the CB and VB of the photocatalyst (given in Table S1 of ESI†). Calculation of the X value of the semiconductor is given in Table S2 of ESI.†
Based on the edge position of the CB and VB, two type-II heterojunctions were formed between NaNbO3/SnS2 and SnS2/Cu2O heterostructures (Scheme 1). If light shines on the heterostructure, electrons and holes are separated from one another and excited from the CB to the VB. Due to the type-II heterojunction, photogenerated electrons migrate from the CB of Cu2O to the CB of SnS2, and the electrons of the CB of SnS2 transfer to the CB of NaNbO3, provided by the lower energy, and holes migrate from the VB of NaNbO3 to the VB of SnS2 and then to the VB of Cu2O under visible-light illumination. The standard reduction and oxidation potential edge values in neutral medium (pH = 7) were −0.41 V and 0.81 V76 (Scheme 1). The formation of an n–n junction between NaNbO3 and SnS2 and n–p junction between SnS2 and Cu2O contributed to the higher photoelectrochemical activity observed. Because of the space charge region at the interface, an internal electrostatic field is formed, and electrons are depleted. These internal electric fields at the heterostructure interface cause photogenerated charge carriers (electrons and holes) to diffuse in opposite directions, which lowers the rate of electron–hole recombination significantly.77

4 Photoelectrochemical measurements
4.1 Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV)
The photoelectrochemical performance of different photocatalysts were investigated using LSV with a potential range of 0 to −1 V versus Ag/AgCl and a scan rate of 10 mV s−1. The J–V curves of bare materials and heterostructures under dark (d) and light (l) irradiation are shown in Fig. 5. The electrolyte used for photoelectrochemical measurement was Na2SO4 (0.5 M) with a pH of 7. Pristine Cu2O rods produced a very low current density of 0.14 mA cm−2 at −0.95 V in dark media. When light was illuminated on the surface of the photocatalyst Cu2O, the current density increased slightly to 0.28 mA cm−2 at −0.95 V due to increase in charge carriers in Cu2O but, due to self-oxidation in Cu2O, photocatalyst activity decreased with time gradually.78 When, we proceeded from the bare catalyst to the heterostructure, the current density increased exponentially due to an increase in the charge-transfer rate-enhanced charge separation in the heterostructure. The photocurrent density of the NaNbO3/SnS2 heterostructure was 1.58 mA cm−2 whereas, when Cu2O was coupled with NaNbO3/SnS2, a ternary heterostructure was formed with an increased current density of 8.84 mA cm−2 at −0.95 V (Fig. 5). The photogenerated voltage (in V) of the photoelectrodes was −0.6, −0.88, −0.93, −0.95, and −0.98 vs. Ag/AgCl for the composite heterostructure of NaNbO3/SnS2/Cu2O, NaNbO3/SnS2, NaNbO3, SnS2 and Cu2O, respectively. The photocurrent density of the NaNbO3/SnS2/Cu2O heterostructure was nearly 5 times higher than that of the NaNbO3/SnS2 heterostructure, and nearly 30 times higher than that of pristine Cu2O due to the fast de-localization of photogenerated electron–hole pairs on the surface of the heterostructure photocatalyst. We also calculated the difference in the current density between light and dark conditions (i.e., photocurrent density) (Table S2 in ESI†). The NaNbO3/SnS2/Cu2O heterostructure showed the highest difference in photocurrent density compared with that of the binary heterostructure and bare material. Wang et al. demonstrated that a type-II heterojunction was formed between n-type TiO2 and n-type BiVO4, and that this nanocomposite of TiO2–BiVO4 exhibited great potential for solar photo-electrocatalysis. It also demonstrated excellent recyclability and stability, which may lower the cost significantly and reduce the probability of secondary pollution.79 Holi and co-workers detailed a n–n–p type of PbS/CdS/ZnO heterostructure in where enhanced charge-carrier separation resulted in efficient visible light-driven PEC efficiency.80 Similarly, Shoja et al. described a TiO2 QDs/BiOBr/BiOCl photocatalyst with a n–p–p heterojunction that increased visible-irradiation absorption and improved the efficiency of charge carrier separation towards a visible light-driven system with excellent reusability.81 Here, the n–n–p heterojunction formed in the NaNbO3/SnS2/Cu2O heterostructure provided an interfacial electric field, which improved charge-separation efficiency and, ultimately, led to a significantly improved photo response. The stability of the photocatalyst NaNbO3/SnS2/Cu2O heterostructure was revealed by a consecutive run of LSV. This photocatalyst showed a similar value for current density under light illumination up to the 100th run of the LSV (Fig. S2 of ESI†). We also evaluated the photoelectrochemical activity of the photocatalyst NaNbO3/SnS2/Cu2O according to the literature. Table 1 depicts the photoelectrochemical performance of various photocatalysts when driven by visible light at an intensity of 100 mW cm−2. For hydrogen evolution, we evaluated the faradaic efficiency (FE), theoretically. Several theoretical studies on 2D materials and heterostructures for water-splitting applications have been published.82

The design of highly effective photocatalysts for photoelectrochemical activity is assisted significantly by their FE. The effect of current density on FE has been explained in detail by Duan,91 who pointed out that the FE increases along with current density. FE has been described theoretically by Genuchten and colleagues92 using Faraday's law. Here, using theoretical calculations, we evaluated the FE for hydrogen evolution from photoelectrochemical reactions (Fig. S3 in ESI†). The ternary composition of NaNbO3/SnS2/Cu2O showed excellent electrochemical performance with 95% FE. We calculated the efficiency of solar-to-hydrogen (STH) conversion93 through eqn (1.4): (1.4)where I = current, A = area of the electrode, thermodynamic potential for water splitting (EO) = 1.23 V, η = faradaic efficiency, and P = power density (100 mW cm−2). The measured value of the ratio of I/A was 17.42 mA cm−2 at −0.99 V, which corresponded to FE of 95%. The calculated STH value for the ternary composition of NaNbO3/SnS2/Cu2O was ∼20.5%.
4.2 Mott–Schottky (M–S) studies
M–S studies were employed to investigate the electronic properties of photoelectrodes: conductivity type, charge carrier density, and flat band position. M–S studies measurements conducted with Na2SO4 electrolyte (0.5 M) at 1 kHz amplitude. The relationship between the flat band potential and semiconductor capacitance yields the M–S equation:78 1/C2 = (2/qε0εNd)(V − VFB − kT/q)(1.5)where C denotes capacitance, ε is the semiconductor's dielectric constant, ε0 denotes vacuum permittivity, Nd is carrier density, V represents the applied potential, VFB denotes the flat band potential, and kT/q is temperature-dependent expression in the M–Schottky equation. The slope of a M–S plot indicates the type of semiconductor: positive and negative slopes of straight lines indicate n-type and p-type semiconductors, respectively. Bare Cu2O exhibited a negative slope, indicating a p-type of semiconductor in which most of the charge carriers are holes. Bare NaNbO3 and SnS2 semiconductors exhibited a positive slope, indicating n-type behavior with most charge carriers being electrons (Fig. 6). The M–S plot of SnS2 is shown as Fig. S4 in ESI.† In the case of the NaNbO3/SnS2 heterojunction, positive slopes were observed, indicating that an n–n type of heterojunction had been formed. In the NaNbO3/SnS2/Cu2O heterojunction, co-existence of positive and negative slopes was observed, indicating that an n–n–p-type heterojunction had been formed, which helps in the low recombination rate of charge carriers in the heterojunction. In addition, the flat band potential of Cu2O and NaNbO3 through the junction of the tangent and abscissa was 0.36 V and −1.01 V, respectively, relative to Ag/AgCl. Using the M–S eqn (1.5), we determined the flat band potential, slope, and charge carrier density of synthesized photocatalysts (Table 2). All synthesized samples had negative and positive slopes, which suggested that the semiconductors were of p and n types. When we proceeded from bare Cu2O to the ternary heterostructure NaNbO3/SnS2/Cu2O, the slope value decreased as the charge carrier density increased. The smaller slope in the M–S plot implied higher charge carrier density.

4.3 Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS)
The charge-transport properties and electrical resistance of photocatalysts were determined using EIS. From EIS, Nyquist plots were used to investigate the interfacial charge transfer resistance of NaNbO3, Cu2O, SnS2, NaNbO3/SnS2, and NaNbO3/SnS2/Cu2O heterostructures. In the EIS spectrum, the intercept of the semicircle (which indicates the charge transfer resistance) can be obtained by extrapolating the plots to the Z′ axis. A heterostructure shows a smaller intercept at high frequency, suggesting faster transportation of charge carriers due to the low resistance and more effective separation of electron–hole pairs. The NaNbO3/SnS2/Cu2O heterostructure showed the smallest charge transfer resistance at high frequencies, thereby suggesting much more effective separation of electron–hole pairs and fast kinetics for the hydrogen evolution reaction. Fig. 7 shows the EIS spectra of all synthesized samples (NaNbO3, Cu2O, NaNbO3/SnS2, and NaNbO3/SnS2/Cu2O). The NaNbO3/SnS2/Cu2O heterostructure had the lowest interfacial resistance compared with that of the other photocatalysts, implying that the ternary heterostructure of NaNbO3/SnS2/Cu2O had higher photoelectrochemical activity for water-splitting applications.

4.4 Transient photocurrent response (TPR)
To further investigate the stability and consistency of photocatalysts, we conducted a TPR experiment with chopped-light irradiation (on–off time of 30 s) at a constant potential of −0.6 V. The TPR vs. time patterns of NaNbO3, Cu2O, NaNbO3/SnS2, and NaNbO3/SnS2/Cu2O heterostructures are shown in Fig. 8. TPR measurement was started at 0 s, and 360 s was chosen as the optimum time to stabilize the current value in a dark condition. After that, we examined the photo response of all synthesized samples under light-on and light-off conditions for up to 760 s. When the light was turned on, the photocurrent response increased rapidly. When the light was turned off, it decreased rapidly to the minimal value. Due to the semiconductor's photocathodic behavior, the photo response of p-type Cu2O was consistent with the behavior of n-type NaNbO3.83,86 At −0.6 V, the photocurrent density of Cu2O was 0.09 mA cm−2, whereas the photocurrent density of the ternary heterostructure (NaNbO3/SnS2/Cu2O) was 0.79 mA cm−2, which was 8 times higher than the photocurrent of bare Cu2O. The photocurrent intensity increased with time; the higher the photocurrent intensity, the stronger was the photocatalyst's ability to generate charge carriers, and the higher was the photocatalyst's efficiency for photoelectrochemical water-splitting.

4.4.1 Stability tests. 
XPS measurements for Cu 2p of bare Cu2O and the NaNbO3/SnS2/Cu2O heterostructure before and after photoelectrochemical tests were carried out. Fig. 9 shows the Cu-XPS spectrum of bare Cu2O and NaNbO3/SnS2/Cu2O heterojunction. Peaks at ∼932.4 and ∼952.2 eV corresponded to the Cu 2p3/2 and Cu 2p1/2 peaks of Cu+, respectively. The characteristic bands between 933.7 eV and 933.9 eV, and between 953.5 eV and 954.4 eV, were assigned to the Cu 2p3/2 and Cu 2p1/2 peaks of Cu2+, respectively. From Fig. 9, the integral area of Cu2+ before (15.3%) and after (18.2%) photoelectrochemical tests in the case of NaNbO3/SnS2/Cu2O indicated that a part of Cu+ could be oxidized to Cu2+ during the photoelectrochemical process. The integral area of Cu2+ before (11.4%) and after (65.8%) photoelectrochemical tests in case of bare Cu2O indicated that a small amount of Cu2O had been oxidized to CuO in air before photoelectrochemical tests, but a major portion of Cu2O was oxidized to CuO after photoelectrochemical tests in the case of bare Cu2O.

5 Conclusions
Low-cost, non-toxic, and stable copper-based heterostructures for use as photocatalysts were synthesized for photoelectrochemical water-splitting applications. To improve the activity and stability of catalysts, we modified the surface of Cu2O with the semiconductor heterostructure of NaNbO3/SnS2 to inhibit photocorrosion and suppress charge recombination in Cu2O. The activity of the resulting NaNbO3/SnS2/Cu2O heterostructure was enhanced markedly (nearly 30 times higher activity than that of bare Cu2O as shown by LSV data) and the stability of the photocatalyst was revealed by TPR measurement.
