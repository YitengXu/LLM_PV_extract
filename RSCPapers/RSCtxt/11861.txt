    , Accepted 12th January 2021First published on 19th January 2021AbstractA novel hybrid supramolecular system with near-infrared photon-excited energy transfer has been successfully constructed, relying on the assistance of upconversion nanoparticles in platinum(II)-based supramolecular polymers. The resulting hybrid system is capable of displaying intriguing photo-switchable and sequential energy transfer features.
Inspired by the photosynthesis process by which photosynthetic organisms (plants, algae, and photosynthetic bacteria) transfer excitation energy from the sun to the reaction center, artificial light-harvesting systems with the coexistence of donor–acceptor (D–A) chromophores are widely explored due to their promising prospects for solar cells, optical sensors, and luminescence encryption materials.1 Until now, various synthetic molecular and supramolecular light-harvesting systems have been established on the basis of D–A pairs.1,2 Despite the progress achieved, the vast majority of artificial light-harvesting systems reported in the literature rely on wavelengths within the UV region and—to a lesser extent—blue visible light for excitation.1a Such high energy excited lights inevitably bring side reactions such as photobleaching issues for the D–A chromophores,3 which is detrimental for the long-term service of light-harvesting materials. On account of this, it is intriguing to achieve effective energy transfer via the mild near-infrared (NIR) light excitation. A feasible approach is to utilize two-photon absorption of NIR light, enabling the conversion of low energy NIR excitation into visible emission through a non-linear optical process.4 However, the output emission intensity is weak due to the low two-photon-absorbing cross-sections of the chromophores, and thus a femtosecond pulse laser with high power density is required. In comparison, lanthanide-doped upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs)5 can be regarded as a superior antennae species that transfer NIR light to acceptor chromophores, which only need to be excited by a cheap, low power density, continuous-wave NIR laser diode source. Nevertheless, the primary challenge of constructing NIR photon-excited energy transfer systems lies in the precise arrangement of UCNPs and chromophores in an appropriate distance scale, which is a prerequisite to achieve highly efficient NIR photon-excited energy transfer.
To attain this objective, 1D π-conjugated supramolecular polymers, comprising π-rod core and peripheral coil segments, can be regarded as an excellent platform.6 Firstly, the rod cores with the presence of chromophores show a strong tendency to aggregate with each other. The collective effect rendered by the long-range-ordered supramolecular system, facilitates the enhancement of the funneling capability.7 Secondly, the peripheral coil segment provides sufficient solubility and meanwhile prevents spontaneous crystallization, which is a basic requirement to provide 1D nanostructures.8 More importantly, it provides a compatible environment to embed UCNPs, creating an efficient distance between UCNPs and the chromophore cores for energy transfer. Thirdly, the energy transfer process can also proceed within the D–A chromophore pairs by conveniently tuning the D–A ratio, which avoids the tedious synthesis procedure encountered in D–A-based dendrimers and polymers.9 Accordingly, UCNPs and D–A chromophores can be organized into one hybrid system, enabling the transfer of excitation energy in a sequential manner.
In our previous studies, we are especially interested in introducing square-planar platinum(II) acetylide units into π-conjugated monomers, because of the intriguing photophysics and stimuli-responsiveness involved in the resulting organometallic supramolecular polymers.10 Based on this consideration, herein a hybrid supramolecular polymerization system has been developed toward NIR photon-excited energy transfer, which relies on the UCNPs and platinum(II)-based supramolecular polymers. In particular, ascribed to the well-matched spectra of UCNPs (NaYF4: Yb/Tm) and supramolecular polymer 1, the energy transfer between them efficiently proceeds via 980 nm light excitation (Scheme 1). Interestingly, the NIR-excited energy transfer can be further reversibly regulated upon 460 nm visible light irradiation, which relies on the photo-switching between 1 and its endoperoxide state 1-O2. Additionally, by co-assembling 1 and 2, a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) supramolecular co-assembly 1/2 has been successfully established. On this basis, a ternary hybrid system is then obtained by mixing UCNPs, 1, and 2 together, which results in an intriguing energy transfer in a sequential way.

The binary supramolecular system UCNPs/1 shows photo-switchable properties upon visible light irradiation, while the backward conversion occurs spontaneously at room temperature. The ternary supramolecular system UCNPs/1/2 features intriguing sequential energy transfer from UCNPs via1 to 2. 
As an initial step, the structural features and spectral properties of the NaYF4: Yb/Tm nanoparticles are explored. In our design strategy, oleate-capped UCNPs composed of NaYF4:20 mol% Yb3+ and 1 mol% Tm3+ are chosen as the energy donor.11 The carboxylic groups of oleic acid absorb on the surface of the UCNPs, whereas the hydrophobic oleate ligands are all located around the external surface of the UCNPs, resulting in the dispersibility of the nanoparticles in apolar alkane media such as methylcyclohexane (MCH). The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image of the UCNPs demonstrates the nearly monodisperse particle size with an average diameter of ∼30 nm (Fig. 1a, and Fig. S1, ESI†). The maximum luminescent band of UCNPs locates in the 425–500 nm region, originating from the 1D2 → 3F4 and 1G4 → 3H6 transitions under the continuous-wave excitation of a 980 nm laser (Fig. 1b).11a

Supramolecular polymerization behaviors are then performed for the designed monomers. In order to visualize the aggregation state through circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, optically active (S)-3,7-dimethyloctyl units are linked to the molecular periphery for the purpose of inducing the helical bias of the resulting supramolecular polymers.12 Bisignated Cotton effect in the range of 300–525 nm is observed for 1 in MCH (c = 1.0 × 10−4 mol L−1, 293 K) (Fig. S2, ESI†). As expected for the analogue 2 (varying the core segment from anthracene to benzoselenadiazole), a sharp Cotton effect locates at the range of 300–400 nm (for 354 nm, Δε = −93.2 L mol−1 cm−1, g value = −5.3 × 10−4; for 365 nm, Δε = 148.6 L mol−1 cm−1, g value = 1.3 × 10−3), along with a weak maximum band centered at 565 nm (Δε = 8.5 L mol−1 cm−1, g value = 4.5 × 10−4, Fig. S3, ESI†). Such phenomena indicate the formation of long-range-ordered supramolecular polymers because of the chirality transferring from the peripheral chiral chains to the inner π segments.
More quantitative information on the supramolecular polymerization process is acquired via temperature-dependent CD spectroscopic experiments. A non-sigmoidal melting curve is obtained for 2, by plotting the fraction of aggregated molecules (φn, on the basis of CD effect at 365 nm) against temperature in MCH (Fig. S3, ESI†). Hence, 2 follows the cooperative nucleation–elongation mechanism,13 which is similar to those adopted by biological systems such as tobacco mosaic virus and cytoskeleton proteins.14 Furthermore, to acquire the thermodynamic parameters for its self-assembly process, the Meijer–Schenning–van-der-Schoot mathematical model is employed.13a The supramolecular polymerization process of 2 features lower Te, he, and higher Ka values than those of 1 (Table S1, ESI†). Moreover, the test tube inversion experiment shows that the critical gelation concentration (CGC) is 20 mmol L−1 in MCH for the red translucent gel of 2 (CGC: 8 mmol L−1 for 1, Fig. S4, ESI†). These results manifest the higher stability of supramolecular polymers derived from 1 compared to that of 2. Thus, it is apparent that the discrepancy of the inner π units not only impacts the spectroscopic information, but also plays a crucial role in the thermodynamic process of supramolecular polymerization and macroscopic aggregated behaviors.
On this basis, energy transfer from UCNPs to platinum(II)-based supramolecular polymers is carefully investigated. Specifically, the maximum luminescent band of UCNPs matches well with the absorption band of the supramolecular polymer 1, which is a prerequisite for energy transfer to occur between the UCNPs and 1. When mixing UCNPs and 1 in MCH, the emission color of UCNPs/1 changes from blue to green-yellow, whilst no emission color can be observed for the individual species 1 under 980 nm irradiation (Fig. 1b and c, insets). Such phenomena demonstrate the occurrence of energy transfer from UCNPs to 1. The energy transfer efficiency (ΦET) is further investigated. When progressively adding 1 into the MCH solution of UCNPs, the emission bands of UCNPs decrease in their intensity, while that of 1 centered at 506 nm gradually increases under 980 nm excitation (Fig. 1c). The relationship between ΦET and weight ratio of UCNPs to 1 is then calculated, according to the formula of (I0–I)/I0, where I0 and I represent the emission intensities of UCNPs at 447 nm before and after addition of 1. A significant ΦET(UCNPs/1) of 93.0% is achieved when the weight ratio of UCNPs/1 is up to 5:1 (Fig. 1d). The interaction of UCNPs with 1 is then investigated. The scanning electron microscope image shows that UCNPs appear to sit on the surface of the fibers of 1, rather than embed in it (Fig. S5, ESI†). The CD signals of 1 hardly change, when adding UCNPs into the supramolecular polymeric solution of 1 (Fig. S6, ESI†). Such results indicate that the stacking mode of 1 cannot be disturbed by UCNPs. It is thus envisioned that, benefiting from the compatible environment between the external oleate ligands of UCNPs and supramolecular polymer 1, UCNPs randomly align along the supramolecular fibers through alkyl chain interdigitation.
After constructing the hybrid supramolecular system UCNPs/1 featuring an NIR-excited energy transfer, we then sought to explore its photo-responsive behaviors. As previously documented, photo-oxygenation of 1 to its endoperoxide species (1-O2, see Scheme 1) rapidly proceeds via blue-light irradiation (LED lamp, 12 W, λ = 460 nm). The conclusion can be illustrated by the vanishment of the 1La bands of an anthracene unit in the UV-Vis absorption spectrum (Fig. 1b). UCNPs/1 exhibits a moderate luminescence intensity centered at 506 nm because of the energy transfer process. Upon irradiating the MCH solution of UCNPs/1 with 460 nm light, the emission band of 1 at 506 nm gradually decreases in its intensity, and levels off within 10 minutes (Fig. 2a). Meanwhile, the original luminescence bands of UCNPs located in the 425–500 nm region gradually increase in their intensity. Considering that no chemical transformation takes place for UCNPs during the light irradiation processes (Fig. S7, ESI†), the fluorescent variation of UCNPs/1 is unambiguously attributed to the conversion from 1 to 1-O2. Considering that the endoperoxide species 1-O2 show a negligible absorption band in the 425–500 nm region, the energy transfer process from UCNPs to 1-O2 is largely prevented. The photo-responsive kinetics of UCNPs/1 is investigated by plotting ln(I471nm/I0) versus irradiation time (Fig. 2a, inset). Linear fitting of the data provides the observed rate constant, which is determined to be 0.45 min−1 from the slope value.

Intriguingly, the backward conversion from 1-O2 to 1 occurs at room temperature in a spontaneous manner. For the spontaneous conversion of UCNPs/1-O2 to UCNPs/1 (Fig. 2b), the luminescent bands of UCNPs gradually vanish, together with the reappearance of emission bands for 1. With the successive light irradiation and room temperature recovery, the deactivation/reactivation of energy transfer between UCNPs and 1 can be manipulated for multiple cycles (Fig. S8, ESI†).
Next, considering the small overlapping area of the upconversion luminescent band of UCNPs and absorption band of 2, the energy transfer process from UCNPs to 2 is restricted (Fig. 3a, and Fig. S9, ESI†). Thus, in order to promote the ΦET of UCNPs/2, we attempt to construct a sequential energy transfer system on the basis of UCNPs and platinum(II)-based supramolecular copolymers 1/2. To establish sequential energy transfer from UCNPs via1 to 2, it is essential to explore the occurrence of energy transfer between the individual pairs (UCNPs to 1, and 1 to 2). As the energy transfer process from UCNPs to 1 has been discussed before, energy transfer from 1 to 2 is then investigated. Depending on the spectroscopic measurements, the spectral overlap integral value between the emission band of 1 and the absorbance band of 2 is calculated to be 3.85 × 1012 M−1 cm−1 nm4, which is large enough to guarantee the FRET process (Fig. S10 and S11, ESI†). Therefore, 1 and 2 are capable of serving as FRET D–A pairs. By progressive addition of 2 into the supramolecular polymeric solution of 1 (molar ratios of 1/2: from 100:1 to 30:1), the fluorescence intensity of 1 at 509 nm decreases, while that of 2 centered at 610 nm gradually increases (Fig. 3b). Meanwhile, the emission colors gradually change from green to red (Fig. 3b, inset). Finally, ΦET(1/2) and kET (energy transfer rate constant) reach the maximum value of 86.0% and 2.91 × 109 s−1 with the addition of 30 mol% amount of 2, respectively (Table S2, ESI†).

(b) Fluorescence spectra of 1 (5.00 × 10−5 mol L−1 in MCH) upon the gradual addition of 2 (0–30 mol%). λex = 400 nm. Inset of (b): fluorescence photographs of 1/2 in MCH taken under 365 nm UV light. (c) Upconversion luminescence spectra of UCNPs/1 (weight ratio of UCNPs/1 maintains in 5:1) via the gradual addition of 2 (0–30 mol%) in MCH.

(d) ΦET(UCNPs/2) and ΦET(UCNPs/1/2) against the concentration of 2. 
The sequential energy transfer process is then studied. Upon progressive addition of 2 into the mixture of UCNPs/1 (the molar ratios of 1/2 vary from 100:1 to 30:1, the amount of UCNPs/1 keeps constant), the emission signal of UCNPs/1 (λ = 505 nm) gradually decreases in its intensity, while that of 2 increases (Fig. 3c). That is, the energy transfer occurs first from UCNPs to 1, then the FRET process occurs from 1 to 2. In particular, when 3 mol% of 2 is added, the sequential energy transfer efficiency (ΦET(UCNPs/1/2)) of the ternary complex UCNPs/1/2 sharply increases to 56.8% (Fig. 3d). The maximum value reaches 68.0% with 30 mol% of 2. Although the energy transfer process could also occur from UCNPs to 2 in MCH, the ΦET value of the ternary complex UCNPs/1/2 is significantly higher than that of the binary complex UCNPs/2 under the same circumstances (e.g., 56.8% for ΦET(UCNPs/1/2) versus 8.6% for ΦET(UCNPs/2), Fig. 3d). Interestingly, the sequential energy transfer only proceeds when 1 and 2 exist in the co-assembled state. The conclusion can be manifested by the same experiment in CHCl3, in which both 1 and 2 are dominated by the monomeric state (Fig. S13, ESI†). Accordingly, it displays the absence of emission spectral change for the ternary complex UCNPs/1/2 in CHCl3.
In summary, we have successfully developed a NIR photon-excited supramolecular energy transfer system assisted by UCNPs. Considering the well-matched spectra between 1 and UCNPs, it gives rise to efficient energy transfer under excitation by a 980 nm laser. The NIR-excited energy transfer process can be further regulated, by taking advantage of the reversible endoperoxide photo-switching on 1. On this basis, the ternary hybrid system UCNPs/1/2 featuring the sequential energy transfer from UCNPs via1 to 2 has been established, which shows an enhanced ΦET compared with that of the binary complex UCNPs/2 under the same conditions. Thus, the NIR-excited supramolecular energy transfer system provides novel avenues toward high-performance hybrid materials with controllable and sequential energy transfer features.

Inset of (b) and (c): photographs of the upconversion emission of UCNPs, 1 and UCNPs/1 in MCH taken under a 980 nm laser. (d) ΦET(UCNPs/1) against the weight ratio of UCNPs to 1.	 

 	Fig. 2  Upconversion luminescence spectra of UCNPs/1 in MCH upon (a) 460 nm light irradiation, and (b) room temperature recovery. Inset of (a): plots of ln(I471nm/I0) versus irradiation time. [1] = 2.00 × 10−4 mol L−1, weight ratio of UCNPs/1 = 5:1.	 

 	Fig. 3  (a) Upconversion luminescence spectral changes in UCNPs upon progressively adding 2 (2.00 × 10−4 mol L−1). (b) Fluorescence spectra of 1 (5.00 × 10−5 mol L−1 in MCH) upon the gradual addition of 2 (0–30 mol%). λex = 400 nm. Inset of (b): fluorescence photographs of 1/2 in MCH taken under 365 nm UV light. (c) Upconversion luminescence spectra of UCNPs/1 (weight ratio of UCNPs/1 maintains in 5:1) via the gradual addition of 2 (0–30 mol%) in MCH. Inset of (c): photograph of the upconversion emission of UCNPs/1/2 (weight ratio of UCNPs/1 is 5:1, [2]/([1] + [2]) = 1:1) in MCH taken under 980 nm laser. (d) ΦET(UCNPs/2) and ΦET(UCNPs/1/2) against the concentration of 2.
