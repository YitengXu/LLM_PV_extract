    , Accepted 20th September 2016First published on 21st September 2016AbstractTwo new conjugated acceptor–π-donor–π-acceptor (A–π-D–π-A) porphyrins have been synthesised using 3-ethylrhodanine (1a) or dicyanovinylene (1b) groups as acceptor units. Their optical and electrochemical properties made these materials excellent electron donors along with PC71BM as the acceptor for solution-processed bulk heterojunction organic solar cells. The devices based on 1a:PC71BM (1:2) and 1b:PC71BM (1:2) processed with CB showed low power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of 2.30% and 2.80%, respectively. Nonetheless, after processing the active layer using a mixture of 3 vol% of a pyridine additive in THF, the PCE was enhanced up to 5.14% and 6.06% for 1a:PC71BM and 1b:PC71BM, respectively. Moreover, when we used LiTFSI as the chemical additive in pyridine/CB-processed 1b:PC71BM an excellent PCE of 7.63% was recorded. The effects over the film morphology and the device characteristics (Jsc, Voc and FF) due to the introduction of LiTFSI are discussed.
Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) with an interpenetrating network of donor–acceptor domains (so called bulk-heterojunctions)1 offer a fresh perspective in solar energy conversion devices. This is fuelled by the success of OSCs based on the active layers consisting of low bandgap conjugated polymers as the electron donor and fullerene derivatives as the electron acceptor with an outstanding PCE of more than 10%.2 Small molecule (SM) donors have also been intensively investigated. Small molecules may be seen as a complementary alternative to polymers due to their advantages of monodispersity, simple synthesis, high purity and easier control of energy levels.3 The solution-processed BHJ OSCs have achieved PCE values of 10%4 and 13.2%5 for single junction and triple junction solar cells, respectively. Such record efficiencies indicate that small molecules may be a strong alternative to conjugated polymers as donors for organic solar cells.
Porphyrins and their derivatives have been extensively investigated for many years in the field of photochemical and biological applications.6 Porphyrins that are derived from chlorophyll are crucial to natural photosynthetic processes in green plants and they are more stable and synthetically easier to obtain than chlorophyll.7 Porphyrins contain an extended two-dimensional π-conjugated system suitable for light-harvesting and efficient electron transfer.8 Moreover, these molecules exhibit large molar extinction coefficients,9 and their electrochemical and photophysical properties can be changed via central metal modification and/or the introduction of suitable substituents at the peripheral positions of the macrocycle.10 As a consequence of these outstanding properties, molecules based on porphyrins have been successfully used as sensitizers in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSC) and PCE values higher than 13% have been achieved.11 Finally, due to the thickness limitation imposed to obtain good carrier extraction, molecules with outstanding light absorption properties are a must; thus, it is clear that porphyrins are an attractive target for OSCs and the application of porphyrin derivatives as donors in solution-processed BHJ organic solar cells has attracted significant interest in recent years, with PCEs from 2 to 9.06% obtained.12
We report here the synthesis, photophysical and electrochemical properties of two new conjugated A–π-D–π-A systems with Zn–porphyrin as a donor (D), linked by ethynylene bridges to thienylenevinylenethiophene and capped by 3-ethylrhodanine (1a) or dicyanovinylene (1b) groups as acceptor units (Scheme 1). On the other hand, the use of the ethynylene units makes the system planar, and the thienylenevinylene oligomers act as excellent molecular wires13 to extend the π-conjugation. Finally, the incorporation of hexyl chains on the thiophene units enhances the molecular solubility. We have used these two porphyrins as donors along with PC71BM as the electron donor for the fabrication of solution processed BHJ OSCs. After the optimization of the morphology of the active layer with a pyridine additive in chloroform solution, the devices based on 1a and 1b as donors showed an overall PCE of 5.14% and 6.06%, respectively. Additionally, the device based on the optimized 1b:PC71BM active layer improved up to 7.63%, with Li-TFSI as the chemical additive used.

Device fabrication and characterization
Organic solar cells were fabricated using the conventional architecture for ITO/PEDOT:PSS/1a or 1b:PC71BM/Al. Indium tin oxide (ITO) coated glass substrates were cleaned sequentially by 10 minutes of ultrasonication in detergent, deionised water, acetone and isopropyl alcohol followed by drying in a nitrogen flow. The substrates were further dried under ambient conditions. PEDOT:PSS solution was filtered and spin coated onto the pre-cleaned ITO substrates at 3500 rpm for 30 s and then annealed at 120 °C for 10 minutes. The blends of 1a or 1b and PC71BM (different weight ratios of the donor and PC71BM, total concentration 16 mg mL−1) were dissolved in chlorobenzene and pyridine (different volume concentrations)/chlorobenzene. The solutions were spin coated on top of the PEDOT:PSS layer at 2000 rpm for 60 s and the samples were dried in a vacuum oven at 40 °C. Finally, the aluminium (Al) electrode was deposited on top of the active layer by thermal evaporation under vacuum of 10−5 Torr. In order to deposit the interlayer between the active layer and Al electrode, bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide lithium salt (Li-TFSI) purchased from Sigma-Aldrich was dissolved in methanol (5 mg mL−1) and then spin coated at 4500 rpm on top of the active layer prior to the deposition of the final Al electrode.
The current–voltage characteristics of the devices were measured using a computer-controlled Keithley 2400 source meter under stimulated AM1.5 G at an intensity of 100 mW cm−2 provided by a solar simulator. The incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE) of the devices was measured by illuminating the device through the light source and the monochromator and the resulting current was measured using a Keithley electrometer under short circuit conditions.
The hole mobilities of the active layers were determined by fitting the dark current to the model of the space charge limited current (SCLC) in the hole only device with the configuration ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/Au. The active layers were deposited under the same conditions as for the corresponding solar cells.
Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization
The synthesis of the target compounds 1a–b began with the syntesis of Zn-porphyrin 2 by a double deprotection of the terminal triple bonds of previous Zn–porphyrin-TMS14 (Scheme 2) by treatment with TBAF. Water was then added to quench the reaction and the product was extracted with CHCl3. The product was used in the following step without further purification. Zn–porphyrin 4 was obtained in 51% yield by reaction of deprotected Zn–porphyrin and iodoaldehyde 3 under Pd-catalyzed copper-free Sonogashira coupling conditions, using triphenylarsine and Pd2(dba)3 as catalysts.15 Finally, the target compounds 1a–b were obtained in 59% and 73% yield, respectively, by the double Knoevenagel condensation reaction of 4 with 3-ethylrhodanine and piperidine as the base for 1a, and malononitrile and Et3N as the base for 1b (see the ESI†).
 Scheme 2  Synthetic route to 1a and 1b. 
All new compounds were satisfactorily characterized by 1H and 13C NMR, FT-IR and MALDI-TOF MS. Mass spectrometry of 1a and 1b confirmed the molecular structures showing the molecular ions at 2367 and 2177 amu, respectively (see the ESI† for synthetic details and full analytical and spectroscopic characterization). The 1H-NMR spectra of 1a and 1b show the vinylic proton peak at 7.97 and 7.80 ppm, respectively, indicating a successful condensation.
Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) showed decomposition temperatures (Td) of 372 °C and 387 °C for 1a and 1b, respectively, suggesting that 1a and 1b have good thermal stability for photovoltaic applications (see the ESI, Fig. S13†). The melting point of both compounds, 1a and 1b, is higher than 300 °C.
Optical properties
The optical properties of 1a and 1b measured in CH2Cl2 solutions are shown in Fig. 1 and the data are listed in Table 1 (also see ESI, Fig. S14 and S15†). The absorption spectra of 1a and 1b show a panchromatic absorption up to 770–780 nm with high absorption coefficient values (see Table 1); a red-shift of the main bands, in comparison with the precursor aldehyde 4, was observed. The broad band at 714 nm is attributed to an intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) process as a consequence of the push–pull effect after the incorporation of the strong electron acceptor moieties 3-ethylrhodanine or dicyanovinylene.

When the absorption spectra were recorded in thin films (as shown in Fig. 1), the maximum absorption of both porphyrins (1a and 1b) was red-shifted and broader with respect to those obtained in solution. This effect is attributed to an intermolecular π–π interaction that leads to an ordered molecular packing in the solid state, thus favouring high charge mobility. The more pronounced red-shift observed for 1b, when compared to 1a, can be attributed to the stronger intermolecular interaction due to the DCV groups, which can interact with both the protons of the alkyl chain and the sulfur atoms of the thiophene rings16 and the nitrogen atom of the DCV can be coordinated with the Zn atom of the porphyrin core.17 Finally, the optical bandgap (Egoptg) was calculated from the onset wavelength (λonset) of the absorption spectra in thin films using Eoptg = 1240/λonset (eV), with values of 1.54 and 1.48 eV for 1a and 1b, respectively.
Electrochemical properties and energy levels
The electrochemical properties of 1a and 1b were investigated in o-DCB/acetonitrile (4:1) as the solvent and using Cyclic Voltammetry (CV) (Fig. S16 and S17†) and Osteryoung Square Wave Voltammetry (OSWV) (Table 1 and Fig. S18, S19†). On the anodic side both compounds showed a first reversible one-electron oxidation wave at 0.44 V for 1a and 0.15 V for 1b (vs. Fc/Fc+ in all cases), which is attributed to the oxidation of the Zn–porphyrin moiety. The first reduction potential of 1a–b was observed at −1.40 V and −1.45 V, respectively.
These data were transformed into plots of frontier molecular orbital energy levels vs. vacuum (see Fig. 2). From the first oxidation potential values, the approximate EHOMO values were determined to be −5.54 eV and −5.25 eV for 1a and 1b, respectively. The lower value of the HOMO energy level in 1a should be beneficial for achieving a higher Voc of the resultant BHJ OSC (see below). The approximated LUMO values are −3.70 eV for 1a and −3.65 eV for 1b.
 Fig. 2  FMO energy levels and band gap (solid area) of molecules 1a–b and their relative position to the LUMO of PC71BM. 
The low LUMO levels contribute to low band gap values (1.84 eV for 1a and 1.60 eV for 1b) and the trend is in good agreement with that observed for the optical bandgap. However, the higher bandgap estimated from the CV measurement may be attributed to the electron transfer during the oxidation and reduction processes and energy is needed to overcome the energy barrier formed at the electrode/solution interface.18
Theoretical calculations
Theoretical calculations were carried out using Gaussian 09 W (DFT, B3LYP/6-31G*) in order to gain an insight into the effect that the length of the conjugated bridge has on the electronic properties of 1a–b. First, the optimized structures of 1a and 1b were obtained. In both cases, the porphyrin macrocycle is almost coplanar with the conjugated oligothienylenevinylene, which favors the packing by π–π stacking (Fig. S20†). The theoretical HOMO and LUMO energy levels and wavefunctions of the frontier molecular orbitals of compounds 1a and 1b were calculated (Fig. 3). The electron densities of the HOMO of both compounds are predominantly localized on the porphyrin macrocycle and the thienylenevinylene bridge. In contrast, the electron densities of the LUMO are distributed over the whole molecule, meaning that the overlap between the HOMO and LUMO facilitates the HOMO to LUMO electronic transitions.

Photovoltaic properties
The photovoltaic properties of 1a and 1b as donors along with PC71BM as an acceptor were investigated using the device structure ITO/PEDOT:PSS/1a or 1b:PC71BM/Al. In BHJ organic solar cells, the relative amount of the donor to acceptor materials employed in the active layer plays an important role for observed PCE, since there should be a balance between the absorbance and charge-transporting network of the active layer. Therefore, we initially varied the donor to acceptor weight ratio and used chlorobenzene as the solvent. It was found that the optimized weight ratio is 1:2 for both 1a and 1b. The current–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the optimized devices are shown in Fig. 4a and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 2.

The device based on 1a:PC71BM showed an overall PCE of 2.30% with Jsc = 7.82 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.98 V and FF = 0.30. The organic solar cell based on 1b:PC71BM showed a PCE of 2.80% with Jsc = 9.04 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.86 V and FF = 0.36. The higher Voc for the device based on 1a:PC71BM is consistent with the deeper HOMO energy level of 1a (−5.54 eV) when compared to 1b (−5.25 eV), since the Voc of a BHJ organic solar cell is directly related to the difference between the HOMO of the donor and the LUMO of the acceptor. However, the value of Jsc is higher for 1b:PC71BM when compared to 1a:PC71BM. Since Jsc is directly related to the light harvesting ability of the active layer and the exciton dissociation efficiency of a D/A interface in the BHJ active layer, the low bandgap of 1b might lead to a higher light harvesting ability in comparison to 1a. Moreover, the LUMO offset for 1b:PC71BM (0.35 eV) is higher than that for 1a:PC71BM (0.30 eV) and this may lead to more efficient exciton dissociation in the former. These two combined effects lead to a higher Jsc for the 1b:PC71BM based organic solar cell when compared to its 1a:PC71BM counterpart (Fig. 4a).
In order to understand why the 1b:PC71BM based device displayed higher Jsc and PCE values, the incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) of porphyrin/PC71BM based devices under the optimal conditions was measured. The results are represented in Fig. 4b. As shown in Fig. 4b, both devices showed wide spectra and these closely resemble the absorption spectra of the corresponding active layers. The IPCE values are higher for the device based on 1b/PC71BM when compared to the 1a/PC71BM device. The integrated values of Jsc estimated from the IPCE spectra of 1a/PC71BM and 1b/PC71BM are around 7.72 mA cm−2 and 8.96 mA cm−2, respectively, and these values are consistent with those obtained from the J–V characteristics of the devices under illumination.
In general, the energy loss (Eloss), defined as Eloss = Eg − qVoc, is one of the most important parameters to evaluate in solar cells and the threshold value is around 0.6 eV19 for efficient charge transport. The values of Eloss for 1a:PC71BM and 1b:PC71BM are 0.58 eV and 0.62 eV, respectively. The Eloss for the device based on 1a is around 0.56 eV, which is lower than the threshold value and results in a low Jsc value. On the other hand, the device based on 1b had an Eloss that was slightly higher than the threshold, which resulted in a higher Jsc as compared to 1a. Moreover, an energy loss below 0.6 eV for 1a:PC71BM was observed and this contributes to the high Voc.19a
In order to obtain information about the difference in the Jsc values of these devices, we measured the hole mobility in the active layer using hole-only devices. The mobility was estimated from the current–voltage characteristics in the dark (Fig. 5) and the curves were fitted with the space charge limited current (SCLC) model to give values of 1.07 × 10−5 and 1.23 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 for 1a and 1b, respectively. There is a slight difference in the hole mobility which cannot explain by itself the measured PCE differences. Therefore, the difference in the Jsc values may be due to the difference in the energy loss and the LUMO offset, as described earlier.
 Fig. 5  Current–voltage characteristics of hole-only devices based on 1a:PC71BM and 1b:PC71BM active layers with and without pyridine additives. 
The Voc of these solar cells is remarkable but the Jsc and FF values are very low. The Jsc and FF values are directly related to the exciton dissociation efficiency and charge transport in the device and they are controlled by the nanoscale morphology of the active layer. As reported in the literature, thermal annealing, solvent additives, solvent vapor additives and two-step annealing (combination of thermal and solvent vapor annealing) are adopted to improve the overall PCE of organic BHJ solar cells. For porphyrin-based organic solar cells, pyridine has been used most commonly as a solvent additive to improve the morphology of active layers that consist of porphyrin and PC71BM – a phenomenon that we have observed previously.20 In order to improve the PCE of our devices, pyridine (different volume percentage concentrations in host chlorobenzene) was employed as the solvent and it was found that 3 vol% gives the best photovoltaic response. The current–voltage characteristics of the device based on the solvent-additive active layer are shown in Fig. 5. The device based on 1a and 1b showed a PCE of 5.14% (Jsc = 10.67 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.93 V and FF = 0.54) and 6.06% (Jsc = 12.97 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.82 V and FF = 0.57), respectively. The improvement in the Jsc and FF with a solvent additive indicates that the pyridine plays an important role in optimizing the nanoscale morphology of the active layer. It has been reported in the literature that pyridine forms a 1:1 complex with metallo-porphyrins21 exhibiting weak supermolecular interactions with fullerenes. We assume that pyridine interacts with PC71BM22 and can promote the mixing of porphyrin with PC71BM. These supramolecular interactions avoid the self-aggregation of both porphyrins and PC71BM during film formation, even for the lower boiling point of pyridine compared to CB. The IPCE spectra of the devices (Fig. 4b) showed that the IPCE values throughout the wavelength measurement range are higher for the devices based on a solvent additive when compared to those without an additive. The values estimated from the integration of IPCE spectra are 10.58 mA cm−2 and 12.87 mA cm−2 for 1a and 1b, respectively, and these are in good agreement with the values obtained from J–V characteristics.
The hole mobility of pyridine/CB cast films was estimated from the J–V characteristics of hole-only devices in the dark and the fitting of these characteristics with the SCLC model (Fig. 5). The values for hole mobility were found to be 1.12 × 10−4 and 2.34 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for 1a:PC71BM and 1b:PC71BM based devices, respectively. The increase in hole mobility indicates the more balanced charge transport in the devices based on pyridine/CB when compared to CB cast devices, thus leading to improvements in Jsc and FF and resulting in an enhancement in the PCE of the organic solar cells.
It was found that both FF and Jsc of the devices were significantly improved when the active layers were processed with a pyridine/CB solvent. To explore the effect of the pyridine solvent additive on the photogeneration of charge carriers and their extraction by the electrodes, the photocurrent density (Jph) was plotted as a function of the effective voltage (Veff) for the devices (see Fig. 6). Jph is defined as Jph = JL − JD, where JL and JD are the current densities under illumination and in the dark, respectively. Veff is defined as Veff = Vo − Vappl, where Vo is the voltage at which Jph is zero and Vappl is the external applied voltage. Veff is related to the minimum driving force for charge extraction and photocurrent is not generated when Veff is below zero and is close to the built in potential.23
 Fig. 6  Variation of Jph with effective voltage (Veff) for the OSCs based on 1a:PC71BM and 1b:PC71BM active layers with and without pyridine additives. 
For an ideal device, Jph increases in a linear manner with Veff in the low Veff region, which indicates that diffusion plays an important role in photocurrent generation, and at a higher Veff the drift contribution is dominant and the photocurrent tends to be saturated.24 The saturation photocurrent density (Jph,sat) is expressed as: Jph,sat = qLGmax, where q is the electronic charge, L is the thickness and Gmax is the number of absorbed photons. The charge collection under short circuit conditions can be estimated as Jsc/Jph,sat. It can be seen from Fig. 6 that for the devices prepared without pyridine as an additive, Jph increases in a linear manner with Veff up to a comparatively high reverse bias and this does not completely reach saturation. This finding indicates that in these devices there are a lot of photogenerated excitons that can be dissociated into free charge carriers and these are not swept out by the electrodes.25 However, for the devices processed with the pyridine/CB solvent, the slope of the linear region is steeper and then becomes saturated. This phenomenon indicates that the bimolecular recombination decreased and charge collection ability increased.
In order to obtain information about the change in the nanoscale morphology of the active layer with the pyridine solvent additive, AFM images (both height and phase) of the active layers were recorded (see Fig. 7) for 1b:PC71BM. The root mean square (rms) value of surface roughness decreased from 1.78 nm to 1.12 nm after the addition of the pyridine. This change may occur because the pyridine could be a good solvent for PC71BM in the host solvent and thus leads to better dispersion and separation between 1b and PC71BM. A similar effect was observed for the 1a:PC71BM active layer.
 Fig. 7  AFM height images (a, c for CB and pyridine/CB processed 1b:PC71BM films, respectively) and phase images (b, d for CB and pyridine/CB processed 1b:PC71BM films, respectively). 
A more homogeneous morphology with a domain size in the range of the exciton diffusion length of the BHJ active layer is favorable for exciton dissociation and interpenetrating pathways for charge transport, thus resulting in increased FF and PCE values for the devices.
In order to improve the PCE of our devices on the optimized active layer, we employed a solution-processable bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide lithium salt (Li-TFSI) as the interlayer between the optimized active layer and the Al cathode, since the extraction of the charge carrier can be improved by using interlayers.26 The interlayers can enhance both the physical and electronic contact between the active layer and the electrodes. Li-TFSI has been used extensively as an additive in solid-state dye-sensitized solar cells to promote doping of the solid-state electrolyte27 and it has recently been used for polymeric solar cells.28 Li-TFSI was deposited from methanol solution. Since, we have found that the effect of Li-TFSI as an interlayer on the photovoltaic response of both the devices based on either 1a:PC71BM and 1b:PC71BM is the same, we only discuss here the OSCs based on the pyridine/CB processed 1b:PC71BM active layer. The current–voltage characteristics under illumination and the IPCE spectra of the device are shown in Fig. 4a and b, respectively, and the photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 2. The device performance was improved significantly on using Li-TFSI as an interlayer between the active layer and the Al electrode. The Voc and FF values increased from 0.82 V to 0.88 V and 0.57 to 0.65, respectively, when LiTFSI was used as an interlayer. It was also observed that Jsc (13.34 mA cm−2) also improved when compared to that for the Al electrode and the overall PCE improved to 7.63%. The Jsc value estimated from the integration of the IPCE spectra (Fig. 4b) is around 13.39 mA cm−2, which is in good agreement with the value obtained from the J–V characteristics under illumination. The interlayer substantially lowered the series resistance (Rs) and increased the shunt resistance (Rsh). The reduction in Rs indicates the effective reduction of contact resistance by the formation of an interface dipole between the PCBM and the Al electrode.29 It is assumed that this enhancement may be due to a reduction in the vacuum level due to the interfacial dipole induced by the insertion of LiTFSI, as reported for organic solar cells based on polymers.28 The dipole layer of LiTFSI shifts the vacuum level of the adjacent negative electrode layer upwards, thus leading to better transport and extraction when aligned with LiTFSI and improving the Jsc and FF values.
In order to obtain further information about the influence that LiTFSI has on the electrical properties of the 1b:PC71BM photoactive layer and/or the interface between each layer, impedance spectroscopy (IS) was carried out (Fig. 8).
 Fig. 8  (a) Nyquist plots, (b) Bode phase plots of the device based on 1b:PC71BM (pyridine/CB) without or with LiTFSI at 0 V with the frequency ranging from 10 Hz to 0.1 MHz. 
The IS study showed a reduction in the interfacial resistance for the device with LiTFSI, as evidenced by the decrease in the radius of the Nyquist plot (Fig. 8a). In addition, the lifetimes of the charge carrier were estimated from the IS measurement. The high frequency peak in the Bode phase plot (Fig. 8b) indicates that charge transfer and the reciprocal of this frequency define the effective charge lifetime.30 The electron lifetime of the OSC with and without LiTFSI was calculated to be 22.46 and 10.14 μs for the device with and without LiTFSI, respectively. These values show that the OSC with LiTFSI undergoes less recombination and more efficient charge transport. We investigated the capacitance–voltage (C–V) characteristics in an effort to understand the influence that the LiTFSI layer between the active layer and the Al electrode has on the internal electric field in the OSC31 (see Fig. 9).
 Fig. 9  Mott–Schottky plots of the devices based on 1b:PC71BM (pyridine/CB) with and without Li-TFSI. 
In the OSC the intrinsic p-doped nature of the organic semiconductor leads to the formation of Schottky contact between the electrode and the active layer. The C–V measurements were performed by applying a small AC signal with a fixed frequency and sweeping the DC bias from reverse bias to forward bias and it was further investigated by considering a Mott–Schottky plot using N = −2(dC2/dV)−1/qεoεrA2,31 where q is the electronic charge, εo is the permittivity of a vacuum, εr is the relative permittivity (dielectric constant) of the active layer (assumed to be 3.5) and N is the charge carrier concentration. From the intercept on the voltage axis, we estimated the values of Vbi to be around 0.80 V and 0.88 V for the devices without and with the LiTFSI layer, respectively. The increase in Vbi matches the improvement in Voc and this indicates that the insertion of the LiTFSI layer strengthens the built in field, thus leading to an improvement in Jsc and FF as a result of more efficient charge extraction and the reduction of charge recombination. The value of N is around 5.45 × 1016 cm−3 and 8.82 × 1016 cm−3 without and with Li-TFSI treatment, respectively. The increase in N after the insertion of Li-TFSI may lead to an increase in surface charge density, which in turn would increase the surface potential.
Although, after the Li-TFSI treatment the FF has been significantly improved, it is still low when compared to its value for other devices reported in the literature; this fact may be due the unbalanced charge transport and recombination losses during the extraction of charge carriers.
Conclusions
In summary, we have synthesized two new conjugated acceptor–π-donor–π-acceptor (A–π-D–π-A) small molecules with a porphyrin core linked by ethynylene bridges to thienylenevinylenethiophene and capped by 3-ethylrhodanine (1a) or dicyanovinylene (1b) groups as acceptor units. The optical and electrochemical properties of these materials were investigated and they were used as donors along with PC71BM as an electron acceptor for the fabrication of conventional solution-processed bulk heterojunction organic solar cells. The weight ratio between the donor (1a or 1b) and PC71BM and the concentration of the pyridine solvent additive were optimized. The resulting devices with 1a and 1b showed PCE values of 5.14% and 6.06%, respectively. The use of LiTFSI as an interlayer between pyridine/CB processed 1b:PC71BM led to a PCE of 7.63% for 1b:PC71BM. The improvement in PCE is attributed to the simultaneous increase in Jsc, Voc and FF due to the increase in the built in potential induced by the interlayer.
