To reduce the cost per watt of energy, polymer solar cells with high power conversion efficiencies are necessary. Tandem polymer solar cells can achieve significantly higher efficiencies; however there are issues associated with polymers' complementary absorption spectra, architectural designs, fabrication approaches and interfacial material selections or engineering. In this article, we review device structures: both regular and inverted architectures, efficiency estimation of double junction polymer solar cells, and the most recent progress in circumventing the limitations of tandem polymer solar cells.

1. Introduction
Energy is central to social, human and economical development. Near-exponential population growth particularly in the 20th century resulted in a 16× increment in energy demand.1 Meanwhile, worldwide energy source supply has increased its diversity. The consumption of traditional fossil fuels is slowing down relative to the historical average.2 The shares of different primary energy sources differ among which natural gas and renewables are projected to have a steady increase; hydro seems constant while oil, coal, and nuclear are expected to decline beyond the year 2010.3 Likewise, the projected contribution from renewable energy to power generation exhibits a steep rise from 2010 to 2030 compared to all other sources.3 The reduction of fossil fuel share and its harmful environmental effects from emitting CO2 gases as well as the recent political commitments made to reduce global CO2 gases have made renewable energy a long term attractive venture.
Solar radiation reaching the Earth's surface delivers approximately 89000 TW.4 Therefore, among all renewable energy sources solar energy is the most abundant and promising alternative with the extractable possibility of supplying more than 15 TW of power; the amount of power projected to drive a carbon-free energy source by 2050.2
Inorganic photovoltaics (PVs) consitute a matured technology having industrial and market presence and an average annual growth rate of global PV installed capacity of ∼44% from 1.8 GW in 2000 to 67.4 GW in 2011.5 Despite this fact, traditional crystalline silicon solar cells that still dominate ∼90% of the global PV market remain largely unaffordable, which is majorly dependent on government subsidies.2 This scenario explains why solar PV only accounts for a paltry 0.1% of the world's electricity generation.6 The prospect of further cost reduction increases the popularity of thin-film solar cells. Organic photovoltaic (OPV) technology has recently been attracting research and industrial attention due to the fact that (a) absorption coefficients of organic materials are higher than those of inorganic counterparts leading to lower material thickness for sufficient light absorption, (b) solution-processability of organic materials such as large area roll-to-roll printing and spray coating result in lower cost and (c) significant progress in material and device engineering has led to efficiencies above 10% in single junction OPV devices which initially was a hurdle.7–9 All these characteristics further pave the way towards commercialization of OPV technology.
Further OPV research and development are needed to improve device efficiency10 and stability/lifetime11 in order to compete favorably with inorganic PV cells. To achieve high efficiency, organic solar cells (OSCs) must have a substantial broadband absorption in the solar spectrum. Existing materials either have high absorption over a limited band of the solar spectrum12–14 or low absorption over a wide range of the solar spectrum.15–18 Materials with both high and broad absorption are still lacking. In addition, assuming a polymer exists that has broadband solar spectrum absorption, thermalization losses may become significant and decrease solar cell efficiency. One approach to achieve high absorption over a wide band of the solar spectrum and reduce thermalization loss is to stack two or more solar cells with complementary absorption in a tandem configuration.19,20 In addition, a tandem configuration that incorporates efficient interconnecting layers eliminates the problem of high internal resistance or ineffective charge transport; a problem which arises in an attempt to increase the active layer thickness to enhance absorption in single junction OSCs.21 We wrote a review article on tandem polymer solar cells, which was published in Energy and Environmental Science in 2010.22 From then on, significant progress in tandem polymer solar cell performance has been achieved with a world record device efficiency of 10.61% being achieved by Yang's group.23 Therefore, we will provide a follow up review focusing on the 2010–2013 period of research on tandem polymer solar cells.
This review aims to summarize the characteristics and developments of tandem polymer solar cells. First, different device geometries and roles of interlayers are discussed. Second, a chronicle of efficiency progress of tandem organic photovoltaic devices is presented. Finally, various issues that are important to tandem polymer solar cells in high-efficiency devices are highlighted.
2. Structure and efficiency estimation of double junction polymer solar cells
Tandem PSCs can provide higher power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) than single junction cells because the range of the absorption spectrum can be expanded using different polymers with complementary absorption bands. In addition, donor–acceptor lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) offsets in each subcell can be modified to minimize the photovoltage loss. The operation of subcells in tandem PSCs is similar to single junction cells; however an inversely oriented heterojunction between the donor layer of one subcell and the acceptor layer of an adjacent subcell is formed if multiple subcells are serially deposited.24 Normally, tandem PSCs with subcells deposited in series will result in build-up of space charge within the device. This situation can be prevented by inserting an interlayer (recombination/tunneling layer) between adjacent subcells. The interlayer should act as a transport layer for electrons and holes; simply put, the interlayer should act as a cathode for one subcell and an anode for the other subcell. The interlayer must be an efficient recombination site for opposite charge carriers from adjacent subcells. Ineffective recombination will bias individual subcells away from their maximum operating power point.25 This recombination layer must minimize photovoltage loss by aligning the Fermi energy levels of adjacent subcells. The recombination sites can also exhibit optical spacer function in which the internal electric field of separate photoactive layers is optimized. The optical spacer effect is particularly beneficial to organic solar cells that have sufficient absorption coefficient and ∼100–200 nm thick films limited by low charge carrier mobility.26 Finally, the interlayer must serve as a protective layer for the underlying subcell while at the same time serve as a robust foundation for the overlying subcell. Since both subcells should have different bandgaps for effective light harvesting, it is necessary to be able to control or tune the bandgaps of conjugated polymers (especially to avoid gaps in the combined absorption spectra). Bandgap tuning of conjugated polymers can be accomplished through synthetic design of copolymerizing electron-rich (donor) and electron-deficient (acceptor) units in the polymer backbone. This ‘hybrid’ donor–acceptor (D–A) strategy is commonly demonstrated in low bandgap conjugated polymers because of the potential to induce bandgap compression in polymers by taking advantage of a high donor HOMO and a low acceptor LUMO.27–35 Interestingly, this D–A approach has been recently used to realize wide bandgap conjugated polymers with significantly improved fill-factors (FFs) and PCE.36 Another strategy to maximize light harvesting in tandem devices is the use of certain acceptors such as fullerene derivatives to enhance absorption and compensate for unavoidable absorption gaps in donor polymers.37 For example, when PC70BM was used to replace PCBM in blends with a low bandgap copolymer poly{(9,9-dioctylfluorene)-2,7-diyl-alt-[4,7-bis(3-decyloxythien-2-yl)-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole]-5′,5′′-diyl} (PF-co-DTB) that has significant absorption gaps, Yao et al. demonstrated an increase in device performance by 50%.38 This enhanced performance was attributed to the stronger absorption of PC70BM in the 440–530 nm range covering the absorption gaps between two absorption peaks (416 and 584 nm) of PF-co-DTB. Recently, it had been argued that due to uncertainty in photon absorption, photoexcitation generated a delocalized long-range coherent superposition of exciton states which was against the previously and widely held belief of localized exciton generation following the photon absorption process. The consequence of this startling revelation is that sometimes the majority of charge carriers can be generated within ∼100 fs, which is sufficiently long enough to affect charge transfer dynamics.39 Once exciton dissociation occurs at the donor–acceptor (D/A) interface, electrons and holes from adjacent subcells recombine at the interlayer of a tandem architecture while the remaining carriers are collected at the electrode. In a series-connected tandem configuration, it is important to optimize the current generated by each subcell at the operating irradiation intensity to avoid the building-up of extra charges and a local electric-field that reduce device efficiency. By varying the thicknesses or material compositions of individual photoactive layers, the current of two subcells can be matched.
The fabrication of tandem PSCs usually result in three types of configurations: (1) mechanical stacking which involves preparation of different subcells on different substrates followed by adhering them together, (2) a monolithic approach of preparing subcells on a single substrate and (3) a mixed approach of stacking several monolithic cells together mechanically.40 The monolithic approach, out of these three configurations, dominates in the literature. Depending on what electrode (anode or cathode) is on the substrate, two basic structures are used commonly: regular and inverted. The following sections therefore revisit these common device geometries and materials at the interlayer in tandem PSCs.
2.1 Regular structure
A schematic illustrating a regular configuration of tandem PSCs is shown in Fig. 1. This structure comprises two polymer/acceptor photoactive layers with different bandgaps for complementary absorption. A high/wide bandgap photoactive layer is used as the bottom subcell to absorb high energy photons while allowing the low energy photons to pass through. These low energy photons are then absorbed by a low bandgap photoactive layer used as the top subcell. One striking feature of the regular structure is that the electrode closer to the incident light is the anode which extracts the holes while the cathode which collects electrons acts as a reflective surface for additional light absorption. The recombination layer commonly employed between the two subcells are ZnO,41,42 TiO2/TiOx (ref. 43 and 44) and Nb2O5 (ref. 45) as electron transport layers and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)23 and MoO3/MoOx (ref. 44, 46 and 47) as hole transport layers. At times thin layers of evaporated metals have also been incorporated into the recombination layers.48–52 Irrespective of the deposition method used, the recombination layer must, in addition, be physically robust not to damage underlying layer(s) and also serve as a protective base for subsequent overlying layer(s).
 Fig. 1  A schematic diagram of a tandem PSC in a regular architecture. 
2.2 Inverted structure
The inverted architecture of a tandem PSC as shown in Fig. 2 comprises a wide bandgap photoactive layer as the bottom subcell and a low bandgap photoactive layer as the top subcell similar to the regular structure. However, the electrodes are reversed with the cathode being closer to the incident light to extract electrons. The inverted device configuration has some benefits over regular ones necessitating its use: (a) incorporation of relatively air-stable high workfunction metals such as silver (Ag) or gold (Au) as anodes thereby improving device stability;53 (b) some polymers in blends with [6,6]-phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) exhibited vertical phase separation such that the rich PCBM phase is closer to the bottom electrode (cathode) resulting in reduced recombination of charge carriers;54 (c) acidic PEDOT:PSS used at the recombination layer dissolves the underneath ZnO layer in a regular structure but an inverted structure in which acidic PEDOT:PSS has been annealed allows easy and successful ZnO deposition.55
 Fig. 2  A schematic diagram of a tandem PSC in an inverted architecture. 
The inverted structure however has one major downside regarding device processing: the low surface energy of polymer:fullerene blends results in difficulty to subsequently deposit aqueous PEDOT:PSS. This limitation is just for emphasis purposes because various methods employed by researchers to circumvent this problem have been discussed in later sections of this review.
Photovoltaic performance in tandem solar cells can be drastically affected by absorption properties, electrical behavior and layer thickness in the tandem device. These parameters need to be carefully optimized. For example, the overall open-circuit voltage (VOC) of a tandem cell is theoretically equal to the sum of VOC of individual subcells.24 This may deviate in reality as the tandem VOC can be lower than expected arising from voltage reduction at different layers and particularly at the recombination layer.
The short-circuit current density (JSC) of a tandem cell is typically lower than that of individual subcells. This lower tandem JSC can be attributed either to the current mismatch between subcells resulting in imperfect recombination at the recombination layer56 or lower absorption of the incident light by the back subcell which limits the overall photocurrent. Likewise, light absorption in the back subcells is further reduced in cases where metallic nanoclusters are incorporated into the recombination layer.57 The VOC on the other hand can be degraded if the thickness of the active layer is large. The increased thickness will increase the series resistance of the device, which may result in a reduced FF as well. The value of the FF depends typically on efficient transport and collection of charge carriers in terms of series and/or shunt resistances. Therefore, the photoactive layer thickness, absorption range, absorption overlap and energy level alignment are important parameters to consider when designing tandem polymer solar devices.
2.3 Double junction cell efficiency estimation

Fig. 3 shows the calculated dependence of series-connected double junction polymer photovoltaic performance including VOC, JSC, and cell efficiency (η) on the absorption range of front and back subcells. The calculation was performed by assuming that (1) individual subcells optimally absorb the same amount of photon flux and produce identical current density, leading to minimal current loss, (2) individual subcell donor bandgaps (Eg) were obtained from their cutoff absorption wavelengths, (3) the VOC of individual subcells was calculated by subtracting Eg from the exciton binding energy (Eb), and (4) the FF and EQE were 0.65 and 60%, respectively. The double junction polymer photovoltaic efficiency was finally estimated using the equation,58  
 Fig. 3  Calculated series-connected double junction polymer photovoltaic performance (e.g. VOC, JSC, and η) dependence on the absorption wavelength of the (a) front and (b) back subcell. (c) Relationship between cell efficiency and the combination of subcell absorption spectrum cutoff wavelengths. Reprinted with permission from ref. 58. 
The JSC of the overall double junction devices increases as the absorption range shifts into the near infrared spectral regions, where higher photon flux is harvested in each subcells. However, the VOC decreases as the donor bandgaps are reduced in individual subcells. The exciton binding energy (Eb) of low bandgap polymers may be similar to those of regular polymers with larger bandgaps. Thus the reduction of polymer bandgaps will lead to a smaller VOC as it is estimated by subtracting Eg from Eb. A compromise between JSC and VOC needs to be obtained in order to achieve a maximum product (JSC × VOC) at a reasonable FF.
To achieve the highest possible double junction cell efficiency, both the front and back subcells need to absorb an optimum range of absorption spectra.58 As shown in Fig. 3a and b, the front subcell needs to efficiently absorb up to a wavelength of ∼775 nm (∼1.6 eV), while the back subcell should harvest the photons with a wavelength up to ∼1240 nm (∼1 eV). Also, the HOMO and LUMO energy levels are required to match a specific acceptor with sufficient offset that is no smaller than exciton binding energy for high cell efficiency.

Fig. 3c shows a combination of absorption ranges in both front and back subcells in a double junction structure for the device efficiency ranging from 2% to ∼19.3%. The wavelengths shown in both the left and right y-axis are the cutoff absorption wavelengths. We also noted that the same power conversion efficiency can be achieved from different combinations of subcell absorption spectra. As shown in Table 1, different absorption combinations for the respective front and back subcells can be used to achieve cell efficiency from ∼16.68% to 19.33% and then back to 16.86%. The estimated cell efficiency here is lower than what Minnaert et al. calculated because we used a lower EQE and FF, and a larger D–A LUMO offset.59,60

3. Progress in efficiency increase of double junction polymer solar cells
Absorption and thermalization losses in single junction polymer solar cells can be addressed by a tandem architecture. A wide and narrow bandgap polymer subcells are usually connected together in different configurations in order to enhance light absorption. Different configurations such as series, parallel, mechanical stacking and folded reflective structures have been reviewed in detail by Siddiki et al.22 Whatever architecture is used, factors such as processability, device performance, and device stability/degradation should be of utmost consideration. The next section takes a chronological look at representative experimental research in 2010 or later.
3.1 Double junction polymer solar cells
In 2010, Gilot et al. optimized tandem PSCs using ZnO nanoparticles and a neutral-PEDOT interconnecting layer between the PFTBT:PC60BM (1:4 w/w) front and the pBBTDPP2:PC60BM (1:2 w/w) back subcell.41Fig. 4a depicts the device architecture. They used an ellipsometer to obtain the refractive indices and extinction coefficients of both polymer:PCBM blend films in order to determine the internal quantum efficiency (IQE). Based on the assumption that highest efficiencies can be achieved in tandem structures when the subcells have identical FF and closely matched current, they matched the JSC and FF of both subcells in the tandem structure with a 180 nm thick front cell and a 125 nm thick back cell. Fig. 4b shows the experimental J–V behavior of single-junction subcells and tandem cells. The PFTBT:PC60BM front subcell achieved a JSC = 5.5 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.98 V, FF = 0.52 and PCE = 2.80%; while the pBBTDPP2:PC60BM back subcell obtained JSC = 6.2 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.61 V, FF = 0.57 and PCE = 2.16%. The tandem cell resulted in JSC = 6.0 mA cm−2, VOC = 1.58 V, FF = 0.52 and PCE = 4.9%. The results showed that the actual tandem JSC surpassed that of the limiting PFTBT:PC60BM front subcell which had a smaller JSC.

Also in 2010, Sista et al. processed P3HT:PC70BM and PSBTBT:PC70BM blends in chloroform for front and back subcells respectively, while the interconnecting layer comprised ultrathin Al layer (0.5 nm)/TiO2/PEDOT 4083.61 The ultrathin Al layer was introduced to improve the deposition of TiO2 as well as ensure that the subcells are electrically connected. Fig. 5a depicts the device structure, and Fig. 5b shows the J–V curves of single and tandem cells. The tandem device was then exposed to UV illumination to reduce the energetic barrier which results in the formation of an Ohmic contact at the TiO2/PEDOT 4083 interface, leading to a 5.84% tandem efficiency with JSC = 7.44 mA cm−2, VOC = 1.25 V, and FF = 63.2% (Fig. 5b).61 In 2011, Chou et al. employed an inverted architecture incorporating the MoO3 (instead of PEDOT:PSS) interlayer to address the acidic concerns of PEDOT:PSS and significant optical loss (∼10%) of PEDOT:PSS.49 The goal was to provide better stability and optical transparency to the interconnecting layer materials of inverted polymer tandem solar cells. They connected P3HT:PC60BM front and PSBTBT:PC70BM back polymer BHJs using the MoO3/Al/ZnO interconnecting layer. MoO3 (10 nm) and Al (1 nm) were thermally evaporated while ZnO (30 nm) was solution-processed. A transmittance value exceeding 95% in the visible and NIR (near infrared) region was realized for the MoO3/Al/ZnO interconnecting layer. Fig. 6 shows the energy-level diagram of the tandem architecture. The low workfunction cathode contact was ITO/ZnO while the high workfunction anode contact consisted of MoO3/Al. The interconnecting layer of MoO3/Al/ZnO facilitated efficient charge recombination of the front and back subcells.

A single junction reference device of P3HT:PC60BM yielded a JSC = 8.6 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.58 V, FF = 64% and PCE = 3.2% while that of PSBTBT:PC70BM resulted in a PCE of 3.7% with JSC = 11.7 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.64 V, FF = 49%. P3HT:PC60BM was placed as the front subcell while PSBTBT:PC70BM was used as the back subcell due to the large JSC difference between these two single junction reference devices. The tandem cell subsequently resulted in JSC = 7.8 mA cm−2, VOC = 1.20 V, FF = 54% and PCE = 5.1%. The VOC of the tandem which was equal to the sum of VOC of component subcells demonstrated effective series-coupling of the two subcells caused by a significant vacuum level shift from the quasi-Fermi level alignment of MoO3 and ZnO. Later in 2011, in order to further increase the tandem device efficiency, Yang et al.62 used a similar device architecture to that reported by Sista et al.,61 but they used Ca/Al instead of the TiO2:Cs/Al cathode. In addition, IC60BA was blended with the P3HT front subcell to enhance VOC and consequently to increase the device PCE. Chlorobenzene was used to process PSBTBT:PC70BM which led to superior JSC (13.7 mA cm−2) and PCE (4.7%) in single junction cells. Also a physically robust modified PEDOT:PSS (PH500) was developed to ensure that successive layers could be successfully deposited. Fig. 7 shows the J–V curves of the P3HT:IC60BA front and PSBTBT:PC70BM back based tandem cells. They achieved 7% tandem PCE with JSC = 7.6 mA cm−2, VOC = 1.47 V, and FF = 63%.62

Most polymer tandem solar cells reported earlier, in a bid to provide all-solution processed fabrication, used either solution-processed ZnO or TiOx/TiO2 as one component to ensure efficient recombination at the interconnecting layers in tandem configurations. It is noteworthy that the solution preparation of TiOx/TiO2 is relatively complicated and requires longer time (∼9 h) and an inert environment.43 Likewise, ZnO solution processing suffers from potential agglomeration of nanoparticles.63 However, in 2012, Siddiki et al. introduced Nb2O5 as a new electron transport layer in the interconnecting layer of a double junction polymer solar cell.45 They demonstrated the feasible potential of using Nb2O5 to provide efficient recombination with pH neutral PEDOT:PSS at the interconnecting layer. The absorption spectra of the MDMO-PPV:PCBM front, back subcells and tandem cells used in their work are illustrated in Fig. 8.

Photovoltaic parameters of single-junction front and back subcells, and tandem cells are summarized in Table 2. The realized single junction cell VOCs are 0.81 V and 0.82 V and the tandem VOC is ∼1.3 V which is significantly higher than that of single junction devices but is still less than the expected value for tandem (∼1.63 V). For the tandem, the JSC was lower and the series resistance was larger than those of individual single junction devices. This was attributed to the possible current mismatch between the front and back subcells due to additional absorption by the back subcell arising from the reflection of light by aluminum. Also the possible interfacial layer barrier might prevent efficient electron–hole recombination at the middle contact resulting in the voltage loss therefore requiring further investigation.

In 2012, the Janssen group reported two separate publications on fully solution-processed inverted and regular tandem polymer solar cells. In the first paper, Kouijzer et al.55 employed P3HT:IC60BA front and PDPP5T:PC60BM back active layers. Fig. 9a shows the inverted device structure. PDPP5T can provide at least 5% efficiency in single junction solar cells and suitable complementary absorption with typical large bandgap polymers in the tandem structure. Also the PDPP5T:PC60BM (1:2 w/w) blend was processed in a co-solvent of chloroform and o-dichlorobenzene (9:1 volume ratio) which exhibited superior device performance. The intermediate recombination layer comprised a continuous 40 nm thick PEDOT:PSS film which was processed by diluting PEDOT:PSS with 25% volume/volume ratio of isopropanol. Subsequently, 30 nm thick ZnO nanocrystals processed from isopropanol were spin-coated on top of PEDOT:PSS. Because the P3HT:ICBA surface is nonpolar and hydrophobic, the authors treated the P3HT:ICBA surface with mild N2 plasma before spin coating acidic PEDOT:PSS. Acidic PEDOT:PSS solutions can readily dissolve ZnO nanoparticles. To prevent this, the PEDOT:PSS film was first annealed thermally before depositing the ZnO nanoparticles. The inverted tandem cell with a 220 nm thick P3HT:ICBA front subcell and a 90 nm thick PDPP5T:PC60BM back subcell demonstrated a JSC = 7.23 mA cm−2, VOC = 1.35 V, FF = 0.60 and PCE = 5.8%.55 This experimentally measured performance of a tandem cell closely resembled that of the constructed tandem cell from the individual subcell performance as illustrated in Fig. 9c.

In their second paper, Gevaerts et al. used a regular tandem structure with PCDTBT:PC70BM front and PDPP5T:PC60BM back subcells.64 The PCDTBT:PC70BM cell was reported to exhibit a trade-off between the JSC and FF while VOC remained constant enabling the photocurrent to be closely matched with that of the PDPP5T:PC60BM cell. Similarly, the intermediate recombination layer comprised 30 nm thick ZnO nanocrystals processed from isopropanol and a 20 nm thick neutral pH PEDOT:PSS processed from water. Fig. 9b shows a schematic view of the device architecture. The tandem cell had a 170 nm thick PCDTBT:PC70BM active layer in the front subcell and a 120 nm thick PDPP5T:PC60BM active layer in the back subcell. The J–V behaviors of the two single junction cells were determined under reduced illumination intensity conditions so that their measured JSC and the JSC obtained from EQE integration were matched. The J–V characteristics of the tandem cell was constructed by adding the two J–V curves of single junctions together following Kirchoff's law and assuming that the recombination layer is loss-free. Fig. 9d shows the J–V behavior of the measured tandem cell with JSC = 9.0 mA cm−2, VOC = 1.44 V, FF = 0.54, and PCE = 7%.64 This agreed well with the constructed tandem cell obtained by adding the performance of component subcells.
Also in 2012, Dou et al. in the Yang group fabricated a tandem solar cell using inverted P3HT:IC60BA (high bandgap) and PBDTT-DPP:PC70BM (low bandgap) active layers.65 The PBDTT-DPP polymer exhibited improved solubility due to its more bulky side-chains and high hole mobility (3.1 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) caused by high molecular weight. The high hole mobility enabled a higher JSC. In addition, the deep HOMO level of −5.30 eV helped to achieve a higher VOC in single junction subcells. The PBDTT-DPP:PC70BM (1:2 w/w) blend with an optimal thickness of ∼100 nm resulted in a JSC of 13.5 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.74 V and a FF of 65% in single junction cells with a high EQE value (∼50%) at long wavelengths. In addition, 90% of 300 fabricated devices gave PCEs above 6.0%. Fig. 10a shows the tandem cell performance with a JSC of 8.26 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.56 V, a FF of 66.8%, and a final PCE of 8.62%. In addition to this high efficiency, Fig. 10b illustrates that the device performance showed good stability over a period of 30 days after encapsulation, as there was no significant drop in PCE. Further investigations were performed on a PBDTT-DPP conjugated polymer by introducing fluorine and selenium into the DPP unit to form PBDTT-FDPP and PBDTT-SeDPP, respectively. An efficiency of 8.3% was realized for an inverted tandem solar cell incorporating P3HT:ICBA front and PBDTT-FDPP back subcells66 while that of P3HT:ICBA front and PBDTT-SeDPP back subcells yielded 9.5%.67

For the first time, a PEDOT:PSS(PH1000)-polyethylenimine ethoxylated (PEIE) all-organic interconnecting layer was demonstrated by Zhou et al.68 One property of PEIE is its ability to provide a workfunction contrast of about 1.3 eV between the two opposite interconnecting interfaces if thin enough (10 nm). This led to PEIE changing the workfunction of PEDOT:PSS from 4.9 eV to 3.6 eV. P3HT:IC60BA front and PBDTTT-C:PC60BM back subcells connected in an inverted tandem yielded: JSC = 7.7 mA cm−2, VOC = 1.50 V, FF = 0.72 and PCE = 8.2%. What was remarkable about this work was that not only was the tandem FF (0.72) much larger than that of individual subcells (0.63 and 0.57), no S-shaped kink was observed in the J–V curve of all the devices. These two factors confirmed an effective carrier selectivity of the recombination layer. Similarly, Kim et al. later in 2013 adopted the same interconnection layer combination: PEDOT:PSS and PEIE.69 The novelty in their work however was a newly synthesized wide bandgap polymer (PTIPSBDT-DFDTQX) as opposed to typically used P3HT. PTIPSBDT-DFDTQX exhibited a deep HOMO level of −5.62 eV and an optical bandgap of 1.85 eV. When PTIPSBDT-DFDTQX:PC70BM (1:2 weight ratio) in chloroform with 3% vol of 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) was fabricated in regular single junction solar cells comprising ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PTIPSBDT-DFDTQX:PC70BM/PFN/Al, a JSC of 10.65 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.92 V, a FF of 62.0%, and a PCE of ∼6.1% were achieved. Because of the enhanced PCE from 3.5% in regular to over 5% in inverted single junctions of poly[4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5b′]-dithiophene-alt-4,7-((2-thylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)-[1,2,5]-thiadiazolo[3,4-c]pyridine] (PBPT-8) (Eg = 1.56 eV) when blended with PC70BM, an inverted tandem of ITO/PEIE/PTIPSBDT-DFDTQX:PC70BM/PEDOT:PSS/PEIE/-PBPT-8:PC70BM/MoO3/Ag was constructed. A JSC of 7.80 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.52 V, a FF of 0.62%, and a PCE of ∼7.40% were consequently achieved without any kink in J–V behavior.
By aiming to improve the VOC and EQE of low bandgap polymers in a single junction cell to complement and enhance the performance of a tandem cell, You et al., recently in 2013, reported a certified 10.6% PCE under standard illumination conditions (1000 Wm−2, 25 °C).23 They started from the earlier reported low bandgap polymer poly[2,6-(4,4-bis-(2-ethylhexyl)-4H-cyclopenta[2,1-b;3,4-b′]-dithiophene)-alt-4,7-(2,1,3-benzothiadiazole)] (PCPDT-BT). Firstly, they introduced two fluorine atoms to act as electron withdrawing units on the benzothiadiazole (BT) unit to form the difluorobenzothiadiazole (DFBT) unit with the objective of lowering the HOMO level. Secondly, they inserted an electron-donating oxygen atom to the cyclopentadithiophene (CPDT) unit to form the dithienopyran (DTP) unit in order to lower the bandgap. The resulting novel polymer poly[2,7-(5,5-bis-(3,7-dimethyloctyl)-5H-dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyran)-alt-4,7-(5,6-difluoro-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole)] (PDTP-DFBT) exhibited a deep HOMO level of −5.26 eV, a high hole mobility of 3.2 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 using the space-charge-limited-current method and a bandgap of 1.38 eV. Inverted single junction devices based on PDTP-DFBT resulted in a JSC of 17.8 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.68 V, a FF of 65.0%, and a PCE of 7.9%. This performance in the single junction, observable EQE peak which is over 60% (∼55% on average) and a photoresponse extending up to 900 nm show suitable potential for tandem solar cell applications. The inverted tandem structure comprises a P3HT:ICBA front subcell and a PDTP-DFBT:PC60BM back subcell with a PEDOT:PSS/ZnO interconnecting layer. The cathode and anode consist of ITO/ZnO and MoO3/Ag, respectively. As shown in Fig. 11, the tandem J–V behavior certified by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) resulted in a JSC of 10.1 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.53 V, a FF of 68.5%, and for the first time a double-digit PCE of 10.6% for a polymer tandem solar cell.

Following the impressive single junction photovoltaic performance of PDTP-DFBT (particularly its high JSC), You et al. once again constructed a tandem solar cell with identical subcells of PDTP-DFBT:PC70BM to enhance the PCE with the intention of increasing light absorption.47 Their motivation was a noticeable average light absorption which is still insufficient (less than 60%) in the visible region for the optimized devices. In addition, a further increase in the thickness of the active layer degrades PCE arising from the charge recombination loss thus justifying their rationalization to stack identical subcells. The two subcells were electrically connected by the MoO3/modified-PEDOT:PSS/ZnO interconnecting layer. MoO3 which has a workfunction of about 5.6 eV was included in the interconnecting layer to facilitate a good Ohmic contact with PDTP-DFBT which has a deep HOMO level of ∼5.3 eV. The maximum absorption of PDTP-DFBT:PC70BM in the single junction increased from 70% in the visible to 90% for two PDTP-DFBT:PC70BM in tandem cells. The photovoltaic performance of PDTP-DFBT:PC70BM in the inverted single junction (ITO/ZnO/PDTP-DFBT:PC70BM/MoO3/Ag) was further slightly improved compared to an earlier report (PCE = 7.9%) resulting in a JSC of 18.6 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.69 V, a FF of 63.0%, and a PCE of 8.1%. Fig. 12 depicts the device structure of the inverted tandem cell with identical subcells based on PDTP-DFBT:PC70BM photoactive layers. In order to allow sufficient absorption and photocurrent to the rear subcell, the thickness of the front subcell was kept around 80 nm while that of the rear subcell was varied from 80–120 nm. The inverted tandem with 80 nm front and 100 nm rear subcells yielded the highest device performance with a JSC of 11.5 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.36 V, a FF of 65%, and a PCE of 10.2%.

3.2 Hybrid double junction solar cells
In 2012, Seo et al. developed a hybrid tandem solar cell using organic and inorganic subcells.76 The front subcell comprised amorphous-silicon (a-Si) (p-type/intrinsic/n-type) deposition using plasma enhanced chemical vapor processing on the aluminum-doped zinc oxide (AZO)-coated glass substrate while the back subcell consists of a low bandgap poly(4,8-bis-alkyloxybenzo(1,2-b:4,5-b′)dithiophene-2,6-diyl-alt-(alkylthieno(3,4-b)thiophene-2-carboxylate)-2,6-diyl) (PBDTTT-C) blended with PCBM. Fig. 13a shows the tandem device structure with magnetron sputtered ITO (50 nm) acting as the electron transport layer and spin-coated PEDOT:PSS (70 nm) serving as the hole transport layer. Fig. 13b shows the J–V curves of the single junction subcells and tandem solar cells. Using an optimized thickness of 81 nm for the a-Si layer, the tandem device performance exhibited a JSC of 6.84 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.42 V, a FF of 0.58 and a PCE of 5.72%. The tandem cell using the ITO/PEDOT:PSS interface achieved a VOC that was 92% of the sum of subcell's VOC. This suggested that the ITO/PEDOT:PSS intermediate layer successfully connected the two subcells.76

4. Issues in double junction polymer solar cells
To achieve a high efficiency tandem polymer solar cell, proper attention and understanding need to be directed to different aspects of tandem device fabrication and measurement. Tandem solar cell material and device engineers should be conversant with experimental issues ranging from (1) the selection of complementary absorption photoactive materials and alternative approaches to realize sufficient light absorption by different subcells, (2) demonstration of successful solution-based layer-by-layer deposition, (3) effective current matching in serially connected subcells to maximize the short-circuit current density (JSC), (4) effective carrier extraction and carrier collection at the electrodes as well as balanced carrier recombination at the interconnecting layers, (5) accurate or reliable measurement of external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of individual subcells in tandem PSCs to further probe into the performance-limiting subcells of the tandem devices. Detailed and commendable reviews had been presented on EQE measurement of the tandem solar cell by various groups77,78 and as a result they will not be discussed in this review. Interestingly, a number of research studies on tandem based on optical and/or electrical simulations had been reported that not only verified experimental results79–83 but also showed the potential of tandem PSCs.59,84 Practical demonstrations still have room for further performance improvement. Hence, this section extensively highlights common experimental material and design issues that limit the development of high efficiency solution-processed tandem PSCs. Most importantly, we also pointed out various approaches presently taken to surmount these issues in order to achieve mechanically robust, optically effective and electrically efficient tandem solar devices.
4.1 Mechanical properties
Since all the subcells are deposited by solution-based processing and the active layer materials are typically soluble in common solvents, the deposition of top subcells can destroy the underneath subcells if not protected carefully. The intermediate layer in tandem polymer solar cells should be physically robust enough to protect the top subcell while not destroying the underlying subcell. Various methods have been adopted by researchers to achieve mechanically stable intermediate layers.
Sista et al.61 modified the P3HT:PC70BM surface by thermal evaporation of 0.5 nm ultrathin Al to provide wettability and improve the dense packing of the subsequently deposited TiO2 nanocrystalline sol–gel film in order to increase the mechanical robustness. Yang et al.62 modified commercial PEDOT:PSS-PH500 with sodium polystyrene sulfonate (SPS) in different ratios to increase mechanical robustness. This PEDOT:PSS was then called modified PEDOT (m-PEDOT). They also added 5% dimethylformamide (DMF) to enhance the conductivity of this m-PEDOT. They tested and compared the mechanical robustness by rinsing the m-PEDOT and traditional PEDOT 4083 surfaces with chlorobenzene (CB). Fig. 14 shows the comparison of optical microscopy images from (a) traditional PEDOT 4083 and (b) m-PEDOT to illustrate the mechanical robustness. Fig. 14a depicts some white regions, showing that PEDOT4083 was not strong enough to protect the underlying P3HT:PC70BM layer which was washed away with CB rinse. This result demonstrated that m-PEDOT is more mechanically robust than the traditional PEDOT 4083. In addition, PEDOT 4083 devices exhibited frequent device shorting after CB rinsing treatment.

A special kind of PEDOT:PSS (Clevios F CPP105D) that was suitable for plastic substrate coatings was diluted with isopropanol and then successfully deposited on the hydrophobic P3HT:ICBA surface without poor film formation by Kouijzer et al.55 In addition, they also used isopropanol as the solvent to prepare ZnO because the UV-Vis measurement showed that isopropanol did not remove the previously deposited PEDOT:PSS layer. Other researchers have modified pH neutral PEDOT:PSS with either water63 or mixed water and isopropanol64 to improve wetting and robustness of PEDOT:PSS on ZnO nanoparticles.
4.2 Optical properties
In order to take advantage of wider solar spectra, proper control of light absorption in the photoactive layers of tandem polymer solar cells has been investigated to improve cell performance. In a tandem solar cell, the back (rear) subcell harvests the unabsorbed light from the front subcell by using complementary absorbing polymers (i.e. high and low bandgap polymers) in the blend with suitable fullerene derivatives. In addition, metal nanoclusters were introduced into the intermediate layers to induce plasmon-enhanced light absorption of the back subcells.71 This section takes a closer look at how these research approaches have increased the efficiencies of tandem polymer solar cells.

4.2.1 Use of complementary absorption polymers. 
The complementary absorption spectrum between the front and back subcells is one of the most important parameters to achieve high efficiencies in organic tandem devices. A common approach to tune the bandgaps and absorption spectra of conjugated polymers is to use alternate electron-rich (donor) and electron-deficient (acceptor) moieties on the polymer backbone in a push–pull strategy.43,55,61,64 By alternating the electron-rich and electron-deficient units, the internal charge transfer process is enhanced along the conjugation chain resulting in an increased effective resonance length of π-electrons. This strategy has been widely used particularly in the design of polymers with small bandgaps. In addition, certain acceptors such as fullerene derivatives can enhance light absorption in tandem solar cells and compensate for unavoidable absorption gaps in conjugated donor polymers.37,85,86Fig. 15a shows the complementary absorption spectra of PCDTBT and PDPP5T conjugated donor polymers reported by Gevaerts et al. in their tandem solar cells.64 PCDTBT with an optical bandgap of ∼1.88 eV mainly absorbed light within 325–660 nm, while PDPP5T exhibited an optical bandgap of ∼1.46 eV and harvested 650–875 nm of light; some spectral overlap could be observed between PCDTBT and PDPP5T at about 600 nm. It is important to observe the absorption gap between 420 nm and 550 nm in PCDTBT; the authors carefully selected PC70BM which has characteristically stronger absorption in the 450–550 nm wavelength range to compensate for this absorption gap. Tandem solar cells using PCDTBT:PC70BM front and PDPP5T:PC60BM back subcells, as a result, achieved an efficiency of 7%. Fig. 15b shows the complementary absorption spectra of P3HT and PCPDTBT donor polymers. P3HT has good interchain packing and hole mobility (0.1 cm2 V−1 s−1).87 P3HT with an optical bandgap of ∼1.9 eV showed an absorption in the spectral range of 350–650 nm, while 1.4 eV bandgap PCPDTBT absorbs within 550–900 nm. 6.5% efficiency was realized in a P3HT:PC70BM and PCPDTBT:PCBM tandem polymer solar cell. Fig. 15c illustrates the absorption spectra of P3HT:PC70BM front and PSBTBT:PC70BM back subcells in the tandem structure reported by Sista et al.61 Due to the significant absorption overlap of the two subcells between 350 nm and 650 nm, the light intensity absorbed by the rear subcell (PSBTBT:PC70BM) was reduced by ∼40% after passing through the front subcell (P3HT:PC70BM). Sista et al. however observed that when an incident light intensity of 1 sun was reduced by half in the single junction PSBTBT:PC70BM device, the shunt resistance and ultimately PCE improved by 10% because of significant reduction in non-germinate recombination. This explanation suggested the reason why PSBTBT:PC70BM could still function as an effective rear subcell and a final tandem efficiency of 5.84% was achieved.61 These diverse issues should be carefully considered when designing and fabricating a tandem polymer solar cell to maximize the optical properties of both subcells in the tandem.

4.2.2 Applying plasmonic effect to enhance light absorption of both front and back subcells. 
The subcell thickness cannot be unlimitedly increased to absorb more sunlight due to inefficient charge transport in organic materials. Recently Yang et al. reported that blending Au nanoparticles (NPs) into the intermediate layers that connect two subcells can induce plasmonic effects to enhance light absorption of both subcells.71 The electromagnetic (EM) field of incident light undergoes resonant interaction with the surface electron density around metallic nanoclusters resulting in localized EM enhancement, which can improve light harvesting through selective light absorption in the wavelength region of interest.88 The shape, size and dielectric constant of the metallic NPs also affect the resonance peak.89 In small molecule tandem solar cells, silver nanoclusters were inserted into the intermediate layers to serve as recombination centers for charges from adjacent subcells and induce a strong near-field to increase active layer light absorption.71,90 The plasmonic effect in single BHJ polymer solar cells has been demonstrated with noticeable PCE enhancement spurring recent utilization of this concept in the tandem PSC architecture.89,91,92 The interconnecting layer selected by Yang et al.71 in their tandem cell comprised the TiO2:Cs n-type buffer layer and 70–80 nm sized Au metal nanoclusters blended into the PEDOT:PSS p-type interconnecting layer to enhance absorption of both subcells. Fig. 16a shows a schematic of the tandem polymer solar cell with the plasmonic Au nanoparticles embedded in the PEDOT:PSS layer at a thickness of 70–80 nm. Fig. 16b shows transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image of an Au nanoparticle with a size of 70–80 nm. 10 nm thick TiO2:Cs was used as the electron transport layer. Since the thickness of the Au nanoparticle was similar to that of the PEDOT:PSS and TiO2:Cs was very thin, the authors concluded that the gaps between the Au NPs and front or back subcells were negligible.71 This implies that both the active layers in the front and back subcells are within the local near-field region of Au NPs; thus enhanced light absorption in both front and back subcells by the near-field of surface plasmon.71

Fig. 17a depicts absorption spectra of tandem solar cells with and without Au NPs. It shows that incorporation of Au NPs into the PEDOT layer increased light absorption in the regions of 450–650 nm and 750–850 nm. Enhancement in the 450–650 nm region was attributed to the plasmon resonance of Au NPs, which is consistent with the spectrum in the inset of Fig. 17a. However, the 750–850 nm region was far from the Au NP plasmon resonance spectrum, which was then explained by extended plasmonic resonance via Au NP aggregation in the PEDOT layer.71Fig. 17b and c show the J–V curves and external quantum efficiency (EQE) of tandem solar cells with and without Au NPs under AM1.5G 100 mW cm−2 illumination. After introducing Au NPs, tandem solar cells exhibited a significantly increased JSC, a slightly enhanced FF and unchanged VOC. The JSC increased from 6.06 to 6.92 mA cm−2, leading to a PCE improvement from 5.22 to 6.24% (Table 4). The EQE was also increased from 32.6 to 41.7% for the front subcell and from 48.1 to 53.1% for the back subcell. The JSC and EQE increase were attributed to the increased light absorption in both front and back subcells caused by the near-field of surface plasmon from the incorporated Au NPs. The slightly decreased EQE in 400–600 nm indicated that incorporation of Au NPs has led to absorption of more light in the front cell, leading to less light for the back cell.

Since the ideal light harvesting in the active layers from the subcells has a complementary absorption spectral range without overlap, the transmission loss caused by the active layers will be insignificant. Also, most of the interfacial layers including electron transport, hole transport and interconnecting layers are made of large bandgap polymers and are transparent, which will not cause much loss in the transmission. However, the reflections at the various interfaces in the double junction multilayered device architecture may cause some transmittance loss, which can be estimated by optical simulation at those interfaces. Based on such simulation results, optical interfacial layer materials and the thickness of active layers can be found out. In addition, previous modelling of optical field distribution in the different device structures suggested that higher current density from inverted structures was caused by enhanced absorption of incident light in the active layer.93 The inverted structures have less parasitic absorption in the PEDOT:PSS and the Ca layer which are used in normal structures.93

4.3 Electrical properties
Series-connected subcells in the tandem structure should support Kirchoff's law: a tandem VOC should be approximately the sum of VOC of component subcells. Likewise, the electrical characteristics of component cells should reflect in the constructed tandem. One of the common problems in series-connected tandem is resistive or potential loss at the interlayer connecting the two subcells. This section gives an overview of observed limitations and approaches employed to mitigate them.

4.3.1 UV illumination or light soaking. 
To achieve efficient electrical connection between subcells, the interconnecting layer must provide efficient recombination sites for electrons and holes without charge carrier accumulation. The interconnecting layer should function electrically such that the Ohmic contact is formed between the subcells. One way to achieve this is through sufficient doping of the electron transport layer (e.g. ZnO, TiO2, Nb2O5, etc.) and the hole transport layer (e.g. PEDOT).63 PEDOT is typically doped with PSS, while ZnO, TiO2, Nb2O5 can be doped by UV irradiation63 or light soaking.94
Kouijzer et al.55 prepared a simplified ITO/PEDOT:PSS/ZnO/Ag device and then tested PEDOT:PSS/ZnO intermediate contact performance with and without UV illumination. Fig. 18 shows J–V curves of a simplified ITO/PEDOT:PSS/ZnO/Ag device at different times (0, 1, 2 and 4 min) of UV illumination on the interconnecting contact. It can be seen that a better Ohmic contact was formed as the UV illumination time increased from 0 to 4 min. Doping by UV illumination was found to saturate at 4 min for this specific batch of the ZnO layer, but varied for other batches. This indicated that the ZnO layer was doped by the photoinduced carriers generated by UV illumination. It has also been observed that after prolonged storage of UV-illuminated single or tandem devices in the dark, the high resistive state at the interconnecting layer is restored. Therefore, repeated UV illumination is required to remove the S-shaped J–V curves.94,95 Other researchers had also demonstrated that UV light treatment on the ZnO/PEDOT:PSS interlayer can improve device performance by forming Ohmic contacts at the interconnecting layer.63

Similarly, Sista et al. employed a 400 nm cutoff filter in the solar simulator to add or remove UV illumination.61 When the UV part of the solar spectrum was blocked with this filter, an ‘S-shaped’ curve around the VOC was observed both in single and tandem devices. The single junction device ITO/PEDOT4083/P3HT:PC70BM/UT-Al/TiO2/PEDOT:PSS/Al used an ultrathin(UT)-Al/TiO2/PEDOT:PSS interface. The tandem cell is ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:PC70BM/UT-Al/TiO2/PEDOT:PSS/PSBTBT:PC70BM/TiO2:Cs/Al, in which UT-Al/TiO2/PEDOT:PSS was used as the interconnecting layer. This S-shape was reported to be caused by an interfacial barrier for charge transport at the interconnecting layer.96 Sista et al. applied UV exposure on both single and tandem cells by removing the 400 nm cutoff filter.61Fig. 19a shows J–V curves of single and tandem cells before and after removing the 400 nm cutoff filter. It was found that ‘S-shaped’ curves vanished in both single and tandem solar cells after removing the filter. Fig. 19b shows the energy level diagram of tandem cells with TiO2/PEDOT4083 as an intermediate layer, which was proposed by Sista et al. TiO2 exhibited a quasi-Fermi level that is close to PCBM LUMO in the front subcell, while the heavily doped PEDOT:PSS had a high workfunction that was close to the donor polymer HOMO in the back subcell. As shown in Fig. 19b, this formed an interfacial triangular barrier for electrons from the front subcell to tunnel or recombine with holes from the back subcell, leading to an S-shape in J–V curves.61 When the carrier concentration is low in TiO2, the width of the triangular barrier is large, which makes the tunneling or recombination difficult. However, the carrier concentration can be significantly increased by the photogenerated carriers from UV illumination. The higher carrier concentration will reduce the barrier width and make it thin enough for tunneling or recombination to occur. This is the reason that UV illumination can result in a Schottky-to-Ohmic transition to remove the S-shape and increase tandem solar cell performance. A similar scenario of the need to photodope TiO2 (ref. 97) or TiOx (ref. 72) and consequently enhance its carrier concentration to realize higher efficiency in solution-processed tandem PSCs had also been observed and reported.

4.3.2 Energy band alignment of interconnecting layers with active layers. 
It is important that the energy bands of interconnecting layers properly align with that of respective active layers in tandem PSCs. This implies that in tandem PSCs, Ohmic contacts need to be formed between the HOMO energy level of a donor polymer and the effective energy band of an adjacent hole-collecting interconnecting layer as well as between the LUMO energy level of an acceptor polymer and the effective energy band of an electron-collecting interconnecting layer. This Ohmic contact formation is necessary in order for the tandem device performance not to suffer from substantial energy or VOC loss. In addition, the two (or sometimes more) materials selected as interconnecting layers in tandem PSCs must be solution-processed in orthogonal solvents in order not to dissolve or damage each other. Likewise, their wetting behavior should be carefully observed. Based on these considerations, numerous published reports on solution-processed tandem polymer solar cells adopted a number of n-type interconnecting layers such as ZnO,63,98 TiOx,72,80–82 Nb2O5,58,99 and PEIE;68,69 as-received or modified aqueous (i.e. water-based) PEDOT:PSS,72,100 MoO3 (ref. 101 and 102) or graphene-oxide75 are commonly used as p-type interconnecting layers. It is noteworthy to mention that commercial PEDOT:PSS is the dominantly employed p-type interconnecting layer (see Table 3). This widespread use of PEDOT:PSS is possibly due to: (1) PEDOT:PSS being water-based provides sufficient robustness that prevents its dissolution by the n-type interconnecting layer typically processed in organic solvents and (2) PEDOT:PSS (∼5.1–5.2 eV) forms a suitable band-alignment with most donor polymers employed in tandem PSCs. As the current trend towards synthesis of conjugated donor polymers with a deep HOMO level (<−5.2 eV) becomes inevitable to realize higher VOC, it becomes even more important for researchers to begin critical search for solution-processed p-type materials that can provide energy-level matching with deeper HOMO level polymers. This necessity for energy-level matching was emphasized by Moet et al. in 2010 during their fabrication of organic tandem solar cells using the neutral PEDOT-ZnO middle electrode.42 The pH value of highly conductive PEDOT:PSS (Clevios PH500) was modified by 3.0 vol% of 2-dimethylaminoethanol (DMAE, Aldrich)–water (1:8 dilution). From UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy, acidic PEDOT:PSS with a pH less than 3 was found to dissolve ZnO layers; also poor quality of wetting or film formation was noticed. A PEDOT:PSS with pH ≥ 3 was therefore recommended to be compatible with ZnO layers and a pH of 3.4 called M-PH500 was eventually used in their solar cell devices. To demonstrate their idea of energy band alignment requirement, they compared the performance of two double junction solar cells having identical active layers as front and back subcells. One incorporated P3HT which had an ionization potential of ∼4.8 eV and the other incorporated poly[9,9-didecanefluorene-alt-(bis-thienylene)-benzothiadiazole] (PF10TBT) that had higher ionization potential (∼5.4 eV). A reduced VOC was expected if a non-Ohmic contact or energy barrier existed between the HOMO of these polymers and neutral PEDOT. Single junction devices with ITO/neutral-PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:PCBM/LiF/Al resulted in a VOC of 0.55 V while a VOC of 1.10 V which was the sum of those of single junctions (0.55 V + 0.55 V) was realized in double junction solar cells connected by the neutral-PEDOT:PSS-ZnO middle layer. This indicated that interconnecting layers did not introduce any energy barrier or limitation to device performance of donor polymers with an ionization potential of 4.8–4.9 eV such as P3HT. On the other hand, ITO/neutral-PEDOT:PSS/PF10TBT:PCBM/LiF/Al single junction solar cells yielded ∼1.0 V but a paltry VOC of 1.5 V could only be achieved in double junction devices as opposed to expected 2.0 V. The origin of this problem was exposed by Kelvin probe (KP) measurement as shown in Fig. 20. As the pH of PEDOT:PSS (PH500) was increased from 1.9 (unmodified) to 8, the workfunction strongly decreased. Likewise, the VOC of PF10TBT:PCBM (1:4) single junction solar cells decreased by ∼0.5 eV at pH 3.4 highlighting the reason for the VOC loss encountered in the double junction solar cells. Nafion-like compounds had been previously calculated to usually exhibit higher ionization potential than polystyrene sulfonic acids (PSS).103,104 A thin layer of Nafion perfluorinated resin solution after high dilution in ethanol was thus spin-coated on top of M-PH500 to recover the workfunction and suitably align the energy band between M-PH500 and PF10TB. Consequently, a VOC of 1.92 V and an efficiency of 4.5% were finally achieved for the double junction solar cell. This additional step of device processing (i.e. Nafion inclusion) could have been avoided if a suitable p-type material was available.

Recently, You et al. in 2013 reiterated the critical role of the interconnecting layer in series-connected tandem polymer solar cells.47 The reason for their emphasis is that modified PEDOT:PSS (called M-PEDOT:PSS) which was previously and consistently demonstrated as an effective interconnecting layer combination with ZnO in inverted tandem solar cells23,62,65 suddenly and unfortunately could not effectively function when PDTP-DFBT:PC70BM was employed as the active layer. One of the possible causes was the same as what Moet et al.42 observed: PDTP-DFBT exhibited a deep HOMO energy level (−5.3 eV). From ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) results shown in Fig. 21a, the workfunction of conventional PEDOT:PSS, after being modified by additives, decreased from 5.3 eV to 5.0 eV which was much lower than that of PDTP-DFBT (5.3 eV). Thermally evaporated MoO3 however with a workfunction of 5.6 eV or even higher105,106 provided good Ohmic contact with PDTP-DFBT; this is also illustrated in the energy band diagram of Fig. 21b. As shown in Fig. 21c, inverted single junction solar cells using M-PEDOT:PSS and MoO3 therefore resulted in a JSC of 17.0 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.68 V, a FF of 0.55, a PCE of 6.4% and a JSC of 18.6 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.69 V, a FF of 0.63, a PCE of 8.1%, respectively. Much of the device performance difference was in the JSC and FF in this case. In order to achieve high tandem efficiency in identical PDTP-DFBT:PC70BM front and PDTP-DFBT:PC70BM back subcells, a MoO3 (15 nm)/M-PEDOT:PSS/ZnO interconnecting layer was employed resulting in 10.2% efficiency. Although this tandem efficiency was high enough, note that MoO3 was thermally evaporated while M-PEDOT:PSS and ZnO were processed from solution. It is therefore necessary for material scientists in the future to begin search for complementary p-type interconnecting materials that (1) is solution-processable and (2) has a deeper energy band level than that of PEDOT:PSS to reduce cost, fabrication complexity and processing time of tandem PSCs.

5. Conclusion and outlook
As central to the operation of double junction polymer solar cells, the photoactive layers should provide complementary absorption by absorbing different regions of solar spectra with high optical densities enabling maximum use of photon energies. Successful design and synthesis of low bandgap polymers has resulted in a relatively large number of efficient single-junction devices that have been integrated into a highly efficient tandem geometry. Presently, there is no viable substitution for P3HT which is still the dominant wide bandgap polymer of choice. The road towards 15% efficiency in tandem polymer solar cells requires further exploration of this research area by chemists or material scientists. The interconnecting-layer design is also critical to ensure that subcells are successfully connected by providing efficient recombination of opposite charge carriers. Ohmic contact between these layers and photoactive layers is necessary for high efficiency; otherwise a total VOC less than the sum of the individual subcell VOC is typically observed. In addition, inexpensive solution-processing of OPVs has been made possible for successful and robust deposition of each layer and subsequent ones. In spite of these requirements, this review, by discussing various technological, device and processing issues, shows that some of these constraints have been overcome. Despite being solved, it is possible that in the future, some of these constraints will resurface. As a result, various approaches leading to this success were carefully highlighted resulting in some high efficiency tandem polymer solar cells with PCEs between 8 and 11% that have been demonstrated in recent years. This accelerated development and efficiency progression in tandem polymer solar cells will further confirm the prospects of OPV technology in coming years. New materials, robust processing, novel device design and device modelling have supported the understanding of the operation and fabrication of tandem polymer cells.

Fig. 22 is a non-exhaustive depiction of recent power conversion efficiency evolution made in solution-processed tandem polymer solar cells. The highest reported efficiency increased from ∼6% in 2010 to ∼10.6% in 2013. It is important to mention that 12% record efficiency has been reported by Heliatek GmbH for vacuum-processed small molecule tandem solar cells. This trend in the increase of tandem OSC efficiency is remarkable and efforts are being geared towards 15% efficiency by 2015. This milestone is possible judging from the fact that there is still a lot of room for improvement in tandem polymer solar cells: (1) absorption spectra in the near infrared region are not broad enough; (2) external quantum efficiencies are still not high over a broad spectral region; (3) light trapping/absorption techniques such as the incorporation of antireflection coatings, optical spacer and plasmonic effects have not been fully investigated. The efficiency projection and possible research breakthroughs further highlight a promising future for OPV as a commercially viable venture in cost effective photovoltaic techniques.
