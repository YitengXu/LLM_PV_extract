    , Accepted 30th November 2021First published on 1st December 2021AbstractWe have designed a simple and new D–A copolymer (PDTQxD-BDTTZ) denoted as P125 based on 8H-pyrrolo[3,4-b]dithieno[3,2-f:2′,3′-h]quinoxaline-8,10(9H)-dione (PDTQxD) and thiazole functionalized benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDTTZ) as acceptor and donor units, respectively, and its optical and electrochemical properties are investigated in detail. P125 showed a deeper HOMO energy level and broad absorption from 300 nm to 680 nm. P125 is used as a donor for the fabrication of binary and ternary polymer solar cells using two non-fullerene small molecule acceptors i.e., medium bandgap DBTBT-IC and narrow bandgap Y6. The optimized P125:DBTBT-IC:Y6 (1:0.2:1.0) ternary-based polymer solar cell attained overall PCE of 16.44%, which is higher than that for optimized binary P125:DBTBT-IC (12.23%) and P125:Y6 (13.09%). The incorporation of DBTBT-IC as the third component not only imparts the energy transfer from DBTBT-IC to Y6 but also optimizes the morphology and nanoscale phase separation in the active layer, leading to balanced charge transport and reduced charge recombination. The enhanced photovoltaic performance of ternary-based polymer solar cells is a result of the strong crystallization of DBTBT-IC.
1. Introduction
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) based on bulk heterojunction (BHJ) photoactive layers have attracted a lot of attention for future photovoltaic technology due to the low-cost solution processing, potential flexibility and semitransparency and compatibility for large-area devices for various indoor and outdoor applications.1–6 The BHJ photoactive layer is composed of a mixture of an electron donor and electron acceptor, which form a bi-continuous and interpenetrating network that can maximize interfacial area between the donor and acceptor.7,8 In PSCs, fullerene derivatives (PC61BM and PC71BM) acceptors have been utilized for a long time9–11 and attained a PCE of about 11%.12 In these PSCs based on the BHJ active layer, the polymer donor is required to contribute most of the light absorption due to the limited light absorption of fullerenes and the low bandgap polymer donors are beneficial for these devices. Recently, with the emergence of non-fullerene small molecule acceptors (NFSMAs),13–17 particularly, ITIC,18Y6 derivatives19 and M36,20 the PCE of PSCs has been increased up to 18% using different conjugated polymers as a donor.21–24 It is predicted that PCE can be attained up to 20% with the selection of appropriate donors and NFSMAs with complementary and well-matched energy levels.25,26 This opens a new avenue for PSCs to their commercialization at a low cost.27,28
Conjugated D–A copolymers prepared by pairing alternately an electron-donating (D) and electron-accepting (A) units are promising donor candidates for efficient polymer solar cells. The absorption profile and the energy levels of D–A copolymers can be tailored by the appropriate selection of D and A units and π-electron delocalization and can be matched with fullerene as well as non-fullerene acceptors. Various A units, i.e., thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4.6-dione (TPD),29,30 quinoxaline (Qx)31–35 and benzothiadiazole (BT)36,37 have been used for the D–A copolymer synthesis along with different D units.
Qx derivative, which consists of two nitrogen atoms at 1, 4 positions make it to be an electron-deficient molecule and have been used as an A unit for the design of D–A copolymers with different D units. Moreover, various substituents functional groups/atoms with electron-withdrawing and donating properties can be introduced at positions 2,3,6 and 7 of the Qx unit to expand the vertical conjugation (two-dimensional conjugation, 2D).38,39 Moreover, the synthetic route for Qx-based polymers is very easy with a high yield.40 Qx, based on D–A polymers is used as a donor for the fabrication of PSCs along with fullerene derivatives as an acceptor and more than 8% of the PCE has been reported.41–44 PSCs based on Qx containing D–A polymers as donors along with NFSMA showed PCEs in the range of 13–16%.45–48 Recently, Zhu et al. have designed D–A copolymers, PBQ5 and PBQ6, based on bithienyl-benzodithiophene as the donor (D) unit, difluroroquinoxaline with different side chains as the acceptor (A) unit and thiophene as the π-bridges. The PSC based on PBQ6:Y6 attains a PCE as high as 17.62%.49
The concept of a ternary active layer consisting of either two donors and one acceptor or one donor and two acceptors has been demonstrated to be an effective approach to improve the PCE of PSCs, retaining the simplicity of the fabrication process in PSCs.50–53 In fact, the concept of the ternary approach plays an important role in boosting the PCE of PSCs and small molecular solar cells, whether in bulk heterojunction or planar heterojunction devices by optimizing the phase separation and photon harvesting efficiency of active layers, as well as reducing energy loss and improving the stability of the devices.54,55 Recently, the PCE of the ternary PSCs has been attained in the range of 18–19%.56,57
Herein, we have integrated the dithieno[3,2-f:2′,3′-h]quinoxaline (QxDT) and TPD unit together and resulting in a new 8H-pyrrolo[3,4-b]dithieno[3,2-f:2′,3′-h]quinoxaline-8,10(9H)-dione (PDTDQx) acceptor. The stronger electron-withdrawing groups of the imide functionality may effectively reduce the electron density in the heterocyclic arene and decrease the frontier energy levels by pulling π-electrons out of the conjugated backbone and assist to have the deeper HOMO energy level of the resulting D–A copolymer. The incorporation of π-electron-withdrawing imide unit can decrease both the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level of the resulting copolymers, which is necessary for air stability.58 We have designed a new wide-bandgap D–A copolymer (PDTQxD-BDTTZ) consisting of PDTQxD and thiazole-functionalized benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDTTZ) as D and A units, respectively, and denoted as P125. We have used P125 as a donor along with two NFSMAs, i.e., medium bandgap DBTBT-IC59 and narrow bandgap Y6 as acceptors for the preparation of PSCs. After the optimization, i.e., screening weight ratio between the donor and acceptor and the solvent annealing treatment, the binary BHJ P125:DBTBT-IC and P125:Y6 based on PSCs showed the overall PCE of 12.23% and 13.09%. The DBTBT-IC showed higher values of VOC and FF compared to the Y6 counterpart and related to the high-lying LUMO energy level and better crystallinity of DBTBT-IC compared to Y6. Finally, we have fabricated PSCs based on ternary PSCs by incorporating a small amount of DBTBT-IC into the host P125:Y6 and the optimized PSC showed an overall PCE of 16.44%.
2. Results and discussion
2.1 Synthesis, characterization of monomer and copolymer
The synthetic routes to the monomer and copolymer P125 are outlined in Schemes 1 and 2. Monomers of M1;60 1,4-dihydroquinoxaline-2,3-diole 2;61 2,3-dichloroquinoxaline 3;56 5,6-dichloro pyrazine-2,3-dicarboxylic acid 4;61 2,3-dichloro-6-(2-octyldodecyl)-5H-pyrrolo [3,4-b]pyrazine-5,7(6H)-dione 6 (ref. 62) were synthesized according to reports in the literature. To obtain the target intermediate 2,3-dichloro-6-(2-octyldodecyl)-5H-pyrrolo[3,4-b]pyrazine-5,7-(6H)-dione 6, for a start 1,2-phenylenediamine (1) was converted to 2,3-dichloroquinoxaline (3), which was then oxidized using KMnO4 to 5,6-dichloropyrazine-2,3-dicarbocylic acid anhydride (5) by cyclization using oxalyl chloride in 62% yield. The anhydride 5 was converted to the basic intermediate 6 by alkyl-amination of 5 with 2-octyldodecylamine hydrochloride in 91% yield. The Stille cross-coupling reaction between 6 and tributyl(thiophen-3-yl)stannane yielded key intermediate 6-(2-octyldodecyl)-2,3-di(thiophene-3-yl)-5H-pyrrolo[3,4-b]pyrazine-57(6H)-dione (7) in 75% yield. The treatment of 7 with NBS and subsequent cyclization of 2,3-bis(5-bromothiophen-3-yl)-6-(2-octyldocecyl)-5H-pyrrolo[3,4-b]pyrazine-5,7(6H)-dione (8) (yield 80%) using UV irradiation in the presence of iodine led to the formation of the target cyclized monomer 2,5-dibromo-9-(2-octyldodecyl)-8H-pyrrolo[3,4-b]dithieno[2,3-f:3′,2′-h]quinoxaline-8,10(9H)-dione M2 (yield 69%). The chemical structures of all intermediates and the target monomer were confirmed using 1H NMR, 13C NMR and elemental analysis (see Fig. S1 and S2, ESI†).

2.2 Synthesis, characterization, and thermal properties of copolymer P125
The synthesis route for the preparation of D–A copolymer P125 is shown in Scheme 1. Polymerization was carried out under the conditions of the Stille cross-coupling reaction using equimolar interaction of trimethylstannyl-substituted benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene M1 and dibromide 2,5-dibromo-9-(2-octyldodecyl)-8H-pyrrolo[3,4-b]bisthieno[2,3-f:3′,2′-h]quinoxaline-8,10(9H)-dione M2 in the presence of a palladium catalyst Pd(Ph3P)4. The reaction occurred under homogeneous conditions, resulting in a high molecular weight copolymer. After polymerization, the copolymer product was isolated by pouring the reaction mixture into methanol. The crude copolymer product was purified using a Soxhlet extraction with methanol and hexane to remove the catalyst residue and low molecular weight material, followed by extraction of the pure polymer product with chloroform. Copolymer P125 was isolated as a dark purple solid in a high yield of 81%. The composition and structure of the polymer were confirmed using elemental analysis and NMR spectroscopy (Fig. S3, ESI†). Broad peaks between 8.81–7.80 correspond to aromatic protons, broad peaks 4.41–3.75 belong to protons of methylene groups attached to the nitrogen atom, and peaks from 3.58–2.85, 2.75–0.25 correspond to protons of long alkyl chains. The absence of characteristic singlet signals at 0.4 indicates the absence of trimethylstanyl end groups in the polymer. The obtained results, in combination with elemental analysis, indicate that the polymerization reaction was successful and complete. The copolymer molecular weight (Mn) and polydispersity (PDI) were determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) using polystyrene as a standard and trichlorobenzene as an eluent. The average numerical molecular weight (Mn) was 22.4 kDa, and the polydispersity (PDI) was 2.09. High molecular weight and low polydispersity favors an increase in charge transport and, as a consequence, the efficiency of PSC. The thermal properties of P125 were investigated using TGA and DSC under nitrogen atmosphere at heating at a rate of 10 °C min−1. The copolymer P125 exhibits high thermal stability with a decomposition temperature above 390 °C (Table 1 and Fig. S2a†). The good thermal stability of the obtained polymer prevents deformation of the copolymer morphology and degradation of the polymer active layer when an electric field is applied. DSC studies showed that the copolymer P125 was amorphous and had no glass transition temperature (Table 1 and Fig. S4b†).

2.3 Optical and electrochemical analysis
The chemical structures of P125, DBTBT-IC and Y6 are shown in Fig. 1a. The optical absorption spectra of P125 in the chloroform solution and in the film are displayed in Fig. 1b and optical parameters are compiled in Table 2. P125 showed two distinct absorption bands in the wavelength range of 300–430 nm and 450–700 nm, corresponding to π–π* transition and intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) between the donor and acceptor units. In the film, the absorption band becomes broader and significantly red-shifted to 603 nm with a shoulder at 555 nm. The red-shift observed in thin-film absorption with respect to the solution is attributed to a more planar copolymer chain structure and/or the degree of interchain π-stacking in a solid-state. This is beneficial for enhancing the charge carrier mobility of the copolymer in a film. Moreover, the absorption edge of the P125 film was found to be around 670 nm and corresponds to the optical bandgap of 1.85 eV. As can be seen in Fig. 1b, the absorption spectrum of DBTBT-IC exhibits complementary absorption spectra of both P125 and Y6.

The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of P125 were estimated by cyclic voltammogram (CV) from the first onset oxidation and reduction shown in Fig. 2 and are determined to be located at −5.45 and −3.48 eV, respectively (Table 2). P125 exhibits a deep HOMO energy level, which is ideal for air stability. Since the deep level of HOMO of any semiconducting material indicates a lesser tendency to oxidation and ensures the resistance to the action of atmospheric oxygen.63 Moreover, the deeper HOMO energy level of the donor is also beneficial for attaining high VOC, as the energy level between the HOMO of the donor and LUMO of the acceptor are directly associated with the VOC of PSCs.64

2.4 Theoretical simulations
In the model of the monomeric unit of the copolymer, methyl groups replace long aliphatic radicals. Hydrogen atoms were used as end groups. Fig. 3–5 show the results of calculating the equilibrium geometry and the geometry in the transition state from the DFT/ωB97X-D3/6-31G(d,p)++ method. The front and side equilibrium geometry of P125 is shown in Fig. S5a and b (ESI†). The torsion angles and the direction of the dipole moment are indicated. The dipole moment is 2.55 D in the equilibrium state and 2.65 D in the transition state. This value of the dipole moment is due to the presence of oxygen atoms in the structure, which have a large electronegativity and partial negative charge. The transition state slightly differs from the ground state in the geometry and dipole moment. The HOMO–LUMO levels and electrostatic potential were calculated using the DFT/M11-L/def2-SVPD method. The experimental values of HOMO and LUMO were obtained in an acetonitrile medium, therefore, while performing the DFT calculation, the effect of acetonitrile was also considered using the PCE solvent model (polarizable continuum model). The calculation results are presented in Fig. 4. The HOMO orbital is located on the 4,8-di(thiazol-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene fragments. The LUMO orbitals are located on the pyrrolo[3,4-b]dithieno[3,2-f:2′,3′-h]quinoxaline-8,10-dione fragment. Negative electrostatic potential values are concentrated on oxygen and nitrogen atoms. The calculated HOMO and LUMO energy levels of P125 are −5.44 eV and −3.76 eV, respectively.

2.5 Photovoltaic performances
The energy level diagrams P125, Y6 and DBTBT-IC are shown in Fig. 1c. The photo-induced hole transfer (PHT) and photo-induced electron transfer (PET) in the BHJ active layer used for PSCs depend upon the HOMO and LUMO offsets between the donor and acceptor, respectively. The LUMO offset between P125 and Y6/DBTBT-IC is about 0.60/0.40 eV, which is higher than the threshold value needed for exciton dissociation, and we assume that there is an efficient PET at the P125/DBTBT-IC and P125/Y6 interfaces in their respective BHJ active layers. The HOMO offset between P125 and Y6/DBTBT-IC is about 0.19/0.32 eV, which is just near to the threshold value needed for PHT from either Y6 or DBTBT-IC to P125. Therefore, in order to validate the PHT from Y6 or DBTBT-IC to P125 in the BHJ active layers, we have measured the photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the pristine Y6 and DBTBT-IC and their blend with P125 excited at the wavelength corresponding to absorption maxima Y6 (820 nm) and DBTBT-IC (670 nm) and shown in Fig. 6a. It can be seen from Fig. 6a shows that the PL intensity of the Y6 or DBTBT-IC is significantly quenched for their blend with P125, indicating effective PHT occurring in these BHJ active layers. It is already reported that efficient PHT may occur from the NFSMA to the donor, even the HOMO offset is smaller and even zero.65–67 Moreover, the PL intensity of P125 is also significantly quenched when blended with either DBTBT-IC or Y6 (Fig. 6b).

We have investigated the photovoltaic performance of P125 as a donor and DBTBT-IC and Y6 as acceptors using the conventional PSC architecture ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer P125:DBTBT-IC or Y6/PFN/Al. The details of PSCs fabrication and their characterization are summarized in the ESI.† We have optimized the photovoltaic performance by varying the weight ratio between the P125 donor and DBTBT-IC or the Y6 acceptor using chloroform solvent and found that the weight ratio of D:A (1:1.2) showed the best photovoltaic performance (data compiled in Table S1a and S1b, ESI†). After that, the P125:DBTBT-IC or P125:Y6 blend with D:A (1:1.2) was subjected to SVA treatment in a THF environment for different exposure times and the PSCs based on the active layer with SVA treatment for 40 s showed the best PCE. The current–voltage (J–V) characteristics under illumination (AM1.5, 100 mW cm−2) for the PSCs are shown in Fig. 7a and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are compiled in Table 3.

The PSCs based on P125:DBTBT-IC and P125:Y6 showed PCE of 12.23% and 13.09%, respectively. The VOC for PSC based on P125:DBTBT-IC is higher than that for the P125:Y6 counterpart and may be related to the high-lying LUMO energy level of DBTBT-IC (−3.88 eV) compared to Y6 (−4.08 eV) since the VOC of the BHJ-PSCs is directly associated with the LUMO–HOMO offset between the acceptor and donor used in the active layer of PSCs. The JSC for the PSC-based on P125:Y6 is higher than that for P125:DBTBT-IC, which may be attributed to the broader absorption spectra and low bandgap of Y6. The higher value of JSC for P125:Y6-based PSCs were also confirmed by the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra as compared to the P125:DBTBT-IC counterpart. As shown in Fig. 7b, PSCs based on P125:Y6 exhibit 110 nm broader EQE spectra than that for the P125:DBTBT-IC counterpart. The broader EQE response for P125:Y6-based PSC is consistent with the broader absorption spectra Y6 (Fig. 1b). The estimated value of JSC from the integration of EQE spectra is about 17.65 mA cm−2 and 23.61 mA cm−2 and is well consistent with the values obtained from J–V characteristics under illumination.
It can be seen from Table 3 that the VOC and FF for the PSC based on DBTBT-IC is higher than that for the Y6 counterpart and JSC is higher for PSC based on Y6 than for the DBTBT-IC counterpart. Taking advantage of the higher value of FF and VOC for PSC based on DBTBT-IC and the larger value of JSC for PSC based on Y6; we varied the weight ratio between the two acceptors (DBTBT-IC and Y6) keeping the content of P125 constant and total concentration is 16 mg mL−1. This concept was first proposed by Zhang et al. for ternary devices by integrating the advantages in the photovoltaic parameters of two binary devices.68,69 We found that the ternary active layer P125:DBTBT-IC:Y6 (1:0.2:1.0) processed using chloroform showed the best PCE (Table S2, ESI†). After that, the optimized P125:DBTBT-IC:Y6 (1:0.2:1.0) ternary film was subjected to SVA treatment in a THF environment for 40 s. The J–V characteristics under illumination for PSC based on the optimized ternary active layer are shown in Fig. 7a. The optimized ternary PSC attained a PCE of 16.44% (JSC of 24.48 mA cm−2, VOC of 0.92 V and FF of 0.73), which is higher than that for the binary counterparts based on either DBTBT-IC or Y6. The EQE spectra of the ternary PSC are shown in Fig. 7b. It can be seen from this figure that the EQE photoresponse is broader from 300 nm to 910 nm compared to the binary counterparts. The JSC value estimated from the integration of EQE response is about 24.31 mA cm−2, which is consistent with the value observed in J–V characteristics under illumination.
We have also measured the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the DBTBT-IC:Y6 (0.2:1.0) film and are about −5.72 and −3.98 eV, respectively, indicating that the HOMO driving force is improved, which enhances the hole transfer efficiency in the ternary PSCs and therefore increases both JSC as well as EQE. The incorporation of DBTBT-IC in the P125:Y6 blend reasonably adjusts the exciton diffusion rate and improves the photovoltaic performance of ternary PSC. As the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of DBTBT-IC:Y6 are between the DBTBT-IC and Y6, it validates the formation of the alloy concept and increases the driving force, contributing to a faster hole transfer process.
In order to get more information about the exciton utilization kinetics in the blend films of PSCs, the photoluminescence (PL) spectra of P125, P125:Y6, P125:DBTBT-IC and P125:DBTBT-IC:Y6 blend thin films were recorded and are presented in Fig. 6b. The films were excited at a wavelength of 600 nm to investigate the exciton dissociation and charge transfer at the D/A interfaces. The values of ΔPL is 92%, 86%, and 96% for P125:DBTBT-IC, P125:Y6 and P125:DBTBT-IC:Y6 films, respectively. The highest quenched PL in the ternary film indicates the most effective exciton dissociation and charge transfer efficiency in this PSC.
In order to investigate the charge transport properties of binary and ternary devices, we have measured the hole mobility (μh) and electron mobility (μe) by measuring the dark J–V characteristics for hole and electron only devices and fitting them with the space charge limited current (SCLC) model (Fig. S6, ESI†). The μh values for the optimized P125:DBTBT-IC, P125:Y6 and P125:DBTBT-IC:Y6 are about 4.67 × 10−4, 4.42 × 10−4 and 4.76 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The μe values are about 2.58 × 10−4, 1.96 × 10−4 and 3.78 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 with μh/μe ratio of 1.81, 2.26 and 1.26 for P125:DBTBT-IC, P125:Y6 and P125:DBTBT-IC:Y6, respectively. Both the higher values of μh and μe and closer to the unity of μh/μe ratio for the ternary active layer compared to binary counterparts lead to better charge transport and results in a larger value of FF in ternary PSC.
In order to get a more clearer understanding of the effect of DBTBT-IC incorporation on the charge recombination processes in the devices, the correlation between JSC and VOC with illumination (Pin) was examined and shown in Fig. 8a and b, respectively. Fitting the JSC–Pin curves with a power law, JSC ∝ (Pin)α, the α values of P125:DBTBT-IC:Y6 is closer to unity than that of P125:Y6, indicating that bimolecular recombination is significantly suppressed in ternary PSC.70 The variation of VOC with Pin can be expressed as VOC ∝ n(kT/q), where k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature in Kelvin and q is the elementary charge. The value slope ‘n’ is 1.21, 1.26, and 1.12 for P125:DBTBT-IC, P125:Y6 and P125:DBTBT-IC:Y6, respectively, indicating that in ternary PSC trap-assisted recombination has been suppressed effectively.

To investigate the exciton dissociation and charge collection probabilities in the binary and ternary PSCs, the variation of the photocurrent density (Jph) with effective voltage (Veff) was analyzed. As shown in Fig. 9, Jph reached the saturation value (Jsat) at high Veff and all the photogenerated exciton are able to dissociate and were subsequently collected by the electrodes. Therefore, the exciton dissociation probability (Pdiss) can be calculated as Jph/Jsat ratio at short circuit conditions.71,72 The value of Pdiss for the optimized ternary PSC is about 0.989, which is greater than that for the binary counterparts, i.e., 0.956 and 0.963 for P125:Y6 and P125:DBTBT-IC, respectively. We have also estimated the charge collection probability (Pcoll) for both devices using the ratio of Jph and Jsat at a maximum power point and is about 0.785, 0.812 and 0.867 for P125:Y6, P125:DBTBT-IC, P125:DBTBT-IC:Y6, respectively. Moreover, the maximum exciton generation rate (Gmax) is estimated as Gmax = Jsat/qL, where q is the elementary charge and L is the thickness of the active layer. The values of the Gmax for the optimized P125:DBTBT-IC, P125:Y6 and P125:DBTBT-IC:Y6 are 1.10 × 1028, 1.38 × 1028 and 1.45 × 1028 m−3 s−1, respectively. The higher value of Gmax for ternary PSC is consistent with the EQE response. These results indicated that the ternary-based PSC has more effective exciton dissociation and charge extraction than binary counterparts, owing to the more D/A interfaces in the ternary active layer as compared to binary counterparts. This agrees with the higher values of JSC and FF values.73

Moreover, in order to get more information on intermolecular charge transfer and energy transfer between two acceptors, the steady-state PL spectra of the acceptor blend were measured and are shown in Fig. 10a and b. As shown in Fig. 11b, when excited at 700 nm, the PL emission peak of the DBTBT-IC is quenched and the characteristics peak of Y6 is gradually increased with the incremental addition of DBTBT-IC, demonstrating the effective energy transfer from DBTBT-IC to Y6. The PL spectrum of DBTBT-IC partially matched with the absorption spectrum of Y6 (Fig. 10a), which also validated the possible energy transfer from DBTBT-IC to Y6. The charge transfer and energy transfer mechanisms are displayed in Fig. 11. There is electron transfer from P125 to both DBTBT-IC and Y6 and the holes are transferred from both acceptors (DBTBT-IC or Y6) to P125. As the HOMO and LUMO energy-level offsets between two acceptors are smaller than the threshold value needed for photo-induced charge transfer, we assume that there is no charge transfer between the acceptors. The energy transfer occurs from the DBTBT-IC to Y6, which is beneficial for the effective utilization of excitons.

In order to get the information about the crystallinity and molecular ordering in the binary and ternary active layers, we collected the XRD patterns of these films that are shown in Fig. S7 (the ESI†). The pristine P125 shows a lamellar (100) diffraction peak at 2θ = 4.38° (d-spacing = 1.91 nm) and π–π stacking (010) diffraction peak at 2θ = 24.42° (π–π stacking distance = 0.360 nm). The binary P125:Y6 showed (100) diffraction peak at 2θ = 4.38° with a weak intensity and π–π stacking (010) at 2θ = 24.12° (π–π stacking distance = 0.356 nm) (Fig. S7†). When DBTBT-IC was introduced, the ternary P125:DBTBT-IC:Y6 (1:0.2:1.0) showed (100) and (010) diffraction peaks at 2θ = 4.82° and 24.58°, with d-spacing and π–π stacking of 1.80 nm and 0.354 nm, respectively, with enhanced intensity. The crystal coherence length (CCL) for ternary in the (010) for ternary is about 2.96 nm, which is larger than that for binary counterpart (2.11 nm). We assume that the enhanced diffraction intensities may be caused by the strong crystalline nature of DBTBT-IC, as compared to Y6. The π–π stacking distance for the ternary film is smaller than that for the binary P125:Y6. These results indicate that the ternary blend film exhibits higher molecular ordering, enhancing the crystallinity of the blend and also promoting an ordered arrangement between the donor and acceptor, which is beneficial for the charge carrier transport, which is consistent with higher mobility and FF in the ternary active layer and PSCs, respectively.74
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were recorded to understand the effect of DBTBT-IC incorporation on the morphology change of the active layers (Fig. 12). The light and dark regions represent donor-rich and acceptor-rich domains, respectively. The P125:Y6, P125:DBTBT-IC and P125:DBTBT-IC:Y6 showed uniform and distinct nano-fibrillar interpenetrating network structures. The ternary P125:DBTBT-IC:Y6 ternary film showed a slightly larger fibrous structure compared to binary counterparts. The relatively more phase separation in the ternary film may be beneficial for exciton dissociation and subsequent charge transport, resulting in improved PCE in ternary PSCs.

3. Conclusion
We have synthesized a new wide-bandgap D–A copolymer donor P125 consisting of pyrrolo[3,4-b]dithieno[2,3-f:3′,2′-h]quinoxalindione and thiazole functionalized benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene as donor and acceptor units, respectively, and used as donor material for the fabrication of binary and ternary PSCs, employing medium bandgap NFSMA (DBTBT-IC) and narrow bandgap NFSMA (Y6). P125 exhibits a deeper HOMO energy level and complimentary absorption to both DBTBT-IC and Y6. The optimized P125:DBTBT-IC and P125:Y6 showed an overall PCE of 12.23% and 13.09%, respectively. When a small amount of DBTBT-IC was incorporated into the P125:Y6 active layer, the optimized ternary PSC, based on P125:DBTBT-IC:Y6 (1:0.1:1.0) showed an impressive PCE of 16.44% with a VOC of 0.92 V, JSC of 24.48 mA cm−2 and FF of 0.73. The PL data demonstrated that the incorporation of DBTBT-IC as the third component improves the exciton dissociation and utilizes the exciton effectively via energy transfer from DBTBT-IC to Y6. The XRD and TEM characterization demonstrates that the introduction of DBTBT-IC as the third component can also optimize the morphology, crystallinity and phase separation in the ternary active layer, which leads to an increase in the charge transport and suppresses the bimolecular as well as trap-assisted recombination and improve the overall PCE of ternary PSC.
