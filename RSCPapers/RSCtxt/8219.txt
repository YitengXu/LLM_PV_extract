    , Accepted 8th August 2017First published on 8th August 2017AbstractThree novel asymmetric thiophene/benzothiophene-flanked diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP)-based polymers with different π bridges, designated as PBTTDPP-BT, PBTTDPP-TT and PBTTDPP-2FBT, were designed, synthesized and employed in organic solar cells. Compared with the reported thiophene/pyridine-flanked DPP, these thiophene/benzothiophene-flanked DPP polymers exhibited narrower band gaps below 1.5 eV, leading to a broadened absorption that ranged from 500 nm to 850 nm. All polymers displayed promising ambipolar semiconducting properties. PBTTDPP-BT, PBTTDPP-TT and PBTTDPP-2FBT showed hole mobilities of 1.20, 1.68 and 1.50 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. Their corresponding electron mobilities were 0.40, 0.14 and 0.35 cm2 V−1 s−1. Interestingly, PBTTDPP-TT and PBTTDPP-2FBT also showed ambipolar properties in organic solar cells. Photovoltaic device based on PBTTDPP-TT as a donor material reached a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 6.96% with PC71BM as an acceptor, while this device as the acceptor material achieved only 0.28% with poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) as the donor. In contrast, PCE of PBTTDPP-2FBT-based devices reached 5.62% with PC71BM and 0.44% with P3HT. These results suggest that the adoption of asymmetric flankers in DPP polymers can effectively tune their ambipolar transporting properties for high-performance organic electronic devices.
Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs), which can supply clean and low-cost energy and are versatile in complex surroundings, have attracted much attention.1–3 Power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of bulk heterojunction (BHJ) with polymer donors and fullerene derivative acceptors have been reported to reach above 11%.4–6 However, the disadvantages of fullerene derivatives are high cost, instability and limited spectra to short wavelength region, and these disadvantages are difficult to overcome. It is also difficult to modulate the design criterion of a donor molecule to achieve a low-lying highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) to cater to the energy levels of PC71BM. In addition, the donors with low-lying HOMO levels contradict a sufficient LUMO level offset between donors and fullerene derivatives.7 Exploitation of non-fullerene molecular acceptors, such as ITIC and its derivatives, delivered the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of OSCs. These studies suggest that non-fullerene acceptors present a promising alternative for future OSC devices.8–11 OSCs based on polymer donors and ITIC-derivative acceptors have exhibited PCEs higher than 13%.8–11 The design and synthesis of new non-fullerene polymer acceptors are another strategy towards all-polymer solar cells, which are more competitive in processing properties and thermal stability.15–17 Electron mobility is a critical parameter of polymer acceptors.3 Polymers with ambipolar transport properties could lead to a unique exciton and charge transport process. Osaka et al. and Li et al. reported that polymers with building blocks of dithienylthienothiophenebisimide and diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) could be versatile as donors or acceptors in OSCs. This finding showed that ambipolar polymers could act as both acceptors and donors in OSCs.12,13 However, studies on polymers with ambipolar properties for a better understanding of their roles in OSCs are rarely reported.
DPP-based polymers have been widely studied in OFETs and OSCs because of their excellent optoelectronic properties and exceptional exciton and charge mobilities.14–20 The broad absorption range of DPP-based polymers can facilitate an effective absorption of the low energy photons, which enhances the value of short circuit current Jsc in OSCs.21–23 Compared with the symmetric heterocycles flanked DPP-based polymers, the asymmetric heterocycles flanked DPP-based polymers have superior tunable band gap because of the electron distribution in the skeleton of the main chain. Dong et al. recently reported two novel asymmetric thiophene/pyridine-flanked DPP-based polymers, which could be used as a donor or an acceptor in different systems.23–25 These polymers displayed promising ambipolar semiconducting properties. Asymmetric thiophene/pyridine-flanked DPP polymers had a deep HOMO level of −5.24 eV and displayed an optical band gap of 1.54 eV in the thin film state, which provided the best PCE of 7.56%. However, Jsc of the PTPyDPP-BT-based device is only ca. 14 mA m−2, which is probably due to the short wavelength of its absorption edges. A broadened absorption spectral range would generally lead to a higher Jsc. Considering that π-extended flanker could effectively extend the absorption range, asymmetric DPP-based polymers incorporated with a higher number of conjugate moieties would have a wider absorption to reach higher Jsc and PCE, whilst maintaining the ambipolar properties.
In this study, we present three novel asymmetric thiophene/benzothiophene-flanked DPP-based copolymers (Scheme 1), namely PBTTDPP-BT, PBTTDPP-TT and PBTTDPP-2FBT (Scheme 2). The polymers were fabricated by altering the absorption edges and energy level via the synergistic effect of thiophene/benzothiophene in the conjugated unit for ambipolar OFETs and high-performance OSCs. PBTTDPP-BT, PBTTDPP-TT and PBTTDPP-2FBT have narrow band gaps and demonstrate high ambipolar performance with hole mobilities of 1.20, 1.68 and 1.50 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, and corresponding electron mobilities of 0.40, 0.14 and 0.35 cm2 V−1 s−1. As donor materials, solar cells based on PBTTDPP-BT:PC71BM, PBTTDPP-TT:PC71BM and PBTTDPP-2FBT:PC71BM yielded PCEs of 5.59%, 6.96% and 5.62%, respectively. As acceptor materials, solar cells based on P3HT:PBTTDPP-TT and P3HT:PBTTDPP-2FBT exhibited PCEs of 0.28% and 0.44%, respectively. These results suggested that asymmetric thiophene/benzothiophene-flanked DPPs are promising building blocks for the development of ambipolar conjugated polymers for high-performance optoelectronic devices.

Experimental
Materials and synthesis
The asymmetric thiophene/benzothiophene-flanked monomer was prepared using previously described methods.23,26–29 PBTTDPP was prepared via a condensation reaction of methyl 5-oxo-2-(thiophen-2-yl)-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrrole-3-carboxylate with 6-bromobenzo[b] thiophene-2-carbonitrile. Then, the desired asymmetric monomer was obtained after N-alkylation of PBTTDPP and subsequent bromination. Finally, the PBTTDPP-BT, PBTTDPP-TT and PBTTDPP-2FBT polymers were synthesized via the Stille-coupling polymerisation. The synthetic details and structural characterisation are provided in the ESI.†
Synthesis of PBTTDPP-BT, PBTTDPP-TT and PBTTDPP-2FBT

Synthesis of PBTTDPP-BT. 
A mixture of 3-(6-bromobenzo[b]thiophen-2-yl)-6-(5-bromothiophen-2-yl)-2,5-bis(2-octyldodecyl)pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4(2H,5H)-dione (0.10 mmol, 107 mg), 5,5′-bis(trimethylstannyl)-2,2′-bithiophene (0.10 mmol, 49.2 mg), Pd2(dba)3 (1.4 mg, 0.0015 mmol, 1.5 mol%) and (o-Tol)3P (1.8 mg, 0.006 mmol, 6 mol%) was dissolved in a mixture of toluene (5 mL) and DMF (0.5 mL) in a Schlenk tube under argon atmosphere. The reaction mixture was stirred at 110 °C for 2 h, and 2-bromothiophene (0.5 mL) was added to react with the trimethylstannyl end group. The mixture was further stirred at 100 °C for 1 h. After cooling to room temperature, the polymer was precipitated from the mixture by pouring it into chilled methanol (20 mL). Then, the crude polymer was collected by filtration and purified by Soxhlet extraction with acetone and hexane. The residue was dissolved in 1,2-dichlorobenzene under reflux. This 1,2-dichlorobenzene solution was then concentrated by evaporation, precipitated in methanol and dried over vacuum. Finally, the desired polymer was obtained with 96% yield. GPC (1,2-dichlorobenzene, 120 °C): Mn = 66.2 kDa, Mw = 153.2 kDa, PDI = 2.31; anal. calcd for C66H92N2O2S4, C, 73.83; H, 8.64; N, 2.61; found: C, 73.79; H, 8.55; N, 2.51.

The synthesis was similar to that for PBTTDPP-TT. 99% yield; GPC (1,2-dichlorobenzene, 120 °C): Mn = 44.3 kDa, Mw = 118.6 kDa, PDI = 2.67; anal. calcd for C64H90N2O2S4, C, 73.37; H, 8.66; N, 2.67; found: C, 73.44; H, 8.69; N, 2.53.


Synthesis of PBTTDPP-2FBT. 
The synthesis was similar to that for PBTTDPP-2FBT. 94% yield; GPC (1,2-dichlorobenzene, 120 °C): Mn = 74.7 kDa, Mw = 174.1 kDa, PDI = 2.33; anal. calcd for C66H90F2N2O2S4, C, 71.43; H, 8.17; N, 2.52; found: C, 71.17; H, 8.19; N, 2.61.

Fabrication of OFET devices
Commercially available polyethylene terephthalate (PET) sheets with a thickness of 200 μm were used as the substrates. The substrates were cleaned using deionized (DI) water and alcohol, rinsed in acetone and dried using nitrogen before the device fabrication. PBTTDPP-BT, PBTTDPP-TT and PBTTDPP-2FBT were dissolved in 1,2-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB) with a concentration of 4 mg mL−1. The polymer solution was spin-coated on the PET sheets with pre-patterned 20 nm gold at 2000 rpm. Polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) dissolved in n-butyl acetate (60 mg mL−1) was spin-coated above the active layer as a dielectric layer and dried at 90 °C for 30 min. Finally, 70 nm thick layer of aluminium was thermally-deposited on PMMA to complete the OTFTs. Field-effect characteristics of the devices were determined in nitrogen using a Keithley 4200 SCS semiconductor parameter analyser.
Fabrication of OPV devices
The polymer donors were obtained according to our previously reported methods.23,28 A ZnO precursor solution was prepared by dissolving 0.197 g of zinc acetate dihydrate [Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O, 99.9%, Aldrich, USA] and 0.055 g of ethanolamine [NH2CH2CH2OH, 99.5%, Aldrich, USA] in 2.239 mL of 2-methoxyethanol (CH3OCH2CH2OH, 99.8%, J&K Scientific, Canada). Patterned ITO glass was purchased from CSG HOLDING Co. Ltd (China). The ITO glass was cleaned by sequential sonications in soap mixed in DI water, DI water, acetone and isopropanol for 15 min at each step. After UV/ozone (Ultraviolet Ozone Cleaner, Jelight Company, USA) treatment for 10 min, a ZnO electron transport layer was prepared through spin-coating at 4000 rpm from the ZnO precursor solution. Then, the ZnO substrates were subsequently baked in air at 200 °C for 30 min. Active layer solutions (D/A ratio = 1:2) with polymer concentrations of 6 mg mL−1 were prepared in ortho-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB) with 3% (volume fraction) of DIO. Active layers were spin-coated in a N2 glovebox at 1500 rpm. A thin layer (5 nm) of MoOx was deposited as the anode interlayer, and 160 nm of Ag was deposited as the top electrode at a vacuum level lower than 2.0 × 10−6 mbar. Active layer solutions (P3HT:PBTTDPP-BT, PBTTDPP-TT, or PBTTDPP-2FBT ratio = 2:1) with PBTTDPP-BT, PBTTDPP-TT and PBTTDPP-2FBT concentrations of 6 mg mL−1 were prepared in ortho dichlorobenzene (o-DCB). Active layers were spin-coated in the N2 glovebox at 2500 rpm. Subsequently, thermal annealing was maintained at 150 °C for 30 min in the N2 glovebox. A thin layer (20 nm) of Ca was deposited as the interlayer, and 80 nm thick layer of Al was deposited as the top electrode at a vacuum level below 2.0 × 10−6 mbar. The J–V characteristics of the devices were measured under AM 1.5G (100 mW cm−2) using a Newport Thermal Oriel 91159A solar simulator. Light intensity was calibrated with a Newport Oriel PN91150 V Si-based solar cell. The J–V characteristics were recorded using a Keithley 2400 source meter unit. Typical cells have device areas of approximately 4 mm2. EQEs were performed in air with an Oriel Newport system (Model 66902). Monochromatic light was generated from a Newport 300 W lamp source.

Optical and electrochemical properties

Table 1 shows the gel permeation chromatography (GPC) measurements; similar average molecular weights (Mn) of 66.2, 44.3 and 74.7 kDa for PBTTDPP-BT, PBTTDPP-TT and PBTTDPP-2FBT, respectively, were obtained. High molecular weights are beneficial for the efficient charge transport in OFETs and PSCs because of enabling easy formation of polymer chain networks.

The UV-vis absorption spectra of the three polymers in thin films and solution are shown in Fig. 1. PBTTDPP-BT, PBTTDPP-TT and PBTTDPP-2FBT have similar optical absorptions because of their similar backbones. Only slight red-shifts were observed in the absorption peaks of PBTTDPP-TT and PBTTDPP-2FBT because of the increased conjugation with thienothiophene and difluoro-bithiophene moieties. The thin films of PBTTDPP-BT, PBTTDPP-TT and PBTTDPP-2FBT displayed slightly broader absorption peaks, and the maximum absorption peaks (λmax) were blue-shifted by approximately 10 nm compared with the spectra of their corresponding solutions. This result suggests a heavy aggregation of these polymers in the solid-state solution. In addition, PBTTDPP-BT, PBTTDPP-TT and PBTTDPP-2FBT have absorption bands at 500–850 nm, which are wider than those of PPyTDPP-BT (500–811 nm) because of the extended conjugation.
 Fig. 1  UV-vis absorption spectra of PBTTDPP-BT, PBTTDPP-TT and PBTTDPP-2FBT in chloroform (a) and thin films (b). 
The results from UV photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) show that PBTTDPP-BT, PBTTDPP-TT and PBTTDPP-2FBT have HOMOs of −4.73, −5.09 and −5.29 eV, respectively, and their corresponding LUMOs were estimated to be −3.24, −3.63 and −3.83 eV using the optical band gaps (Table 1) measured from the onset of thin-film absorption. Moreover, PBTTDPP-BT, PBTTDPP-TT and PBTTDPP-2FBT exhibited narrower band gaps (ca. 1.46 eV) than PPyDPP-BT (ca. 1.54 eV). The appropriate HOMO/LUMO levels of PBTTDPP-BT, PBTTDPP-TT and PBTTDPP-2FBT combining the narrow band gaps may enable these polymers to behave as promising ambipolar semiconductors for high-performance optoelectronic devices. Moreover, the LUMO of PBTTDPP-2FBT is extremely close to that of PC71BM, which is not ideal for charge transfer (Fig. 2). Detailed physicochemical characteristics and molecular weights for PBTTDPP-BT, PBTTDPP-TT and PBTTDPP-2FBT are summarized in Table 1.

Ambipolar transporting properties
Top-gate/bottom-contact OFETs were fabricated based on spin-coated PBTTDPP-BT, PBTTDPP-TT and PBTTDPP-2FBT thin films to investigate the semiconducting properties of the three polymers. The representative transfer and output curves of PBTTDPP-2FBT-based thin film OFETs are shown in Fig. 3, whereas those for PBTTDPP-BT- and PBTTDPP-TT-based thin film OFETs are shown in the ESI.† All OFETs based on the three polymers demonstrate ideal field-effect modulating characteristics with the typical ambipolar transporting property even under ambient conditions. The good electron transport property of PBTTDPP-BT, PBTTDPP-TT and PBTTDPP-2FBT is probably due to the relatively deep LUMO levels and the protection of top PMMA gate, avoiding environmental influences, such as of H2O and O2. The transfer curves show that the calculated saturated electron (μe) and hole mobilities (μh) for PBTTDPP-BT are 1.20 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 0.40 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The calculated saturated electron and hole mobilities for PBTTDPP-TT are 1.68 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 0.14 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. PBTTDPP-2FBT demonstrates a hole mobility of 1.50 cm2 V−1 s−1 and an electron mobility of 0.35 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The significant differences in charge carrier mobilities of PBTTDPP-BT, PBTTDPP-TT and PBTTDPP-2FBT are strongly related to their diverse effect of molecular structures, leading to the distinct molecular crystallinity and film morphology. Their distinct characteristics are also reflected by their OSC performance as follows.

Proposed polymers as both electron donors and acceptors in OSCs
The LUMO/HOMO levels of PBTTDPP-BT, PBTTDPP-TT and PBTTDPP-2FBT verify that these polymers are promising ambipolar copolymers with relatively high electron and hole charge carrier mobilities. Thus, these polymers may serve as both acceptors and donors for effective OSCs. OSC devices were designated as ITO/ZnO/PBTTDPP-BT:PC71BM/MoOx/Ag, ITO/ZnO/PBTTDPP-TT:PC71BM/MoOx/Ag and ITO/ZnO/PBTTDPP-2FBT:PC71BM/MoOx/Ag with PBTTDPP-BT, PBTTDPP-TT and PBTTDPP-2FBT as donor materials, respectively.
The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the solar cells were measured under AM 1.5G illumination with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2. The blend films with different donor/acceptor ratios were systematically adjusted to optimize the device performance. The results demonstrated that the blend thin films of PBTTDPP-BT:PC71BM, PBTTDPP-TT:PC71BM and PBTTDPP-2FBT:PC71BM exhibited the best photovoltaic performance at a weight ratio of 1:2. PBTTDPP-BT:PC71BM thin-film-based OSCs can obtain a PCE of 5.59%, with Voc of 0.661 V, Jsc of 13.47 mA cm−2 and an FF of 62.8%. The optimized device with PBTTDPP-TT as a donor can obtain a PCE of 6.96%, with Voc of 0.694 V, Jsc of 16.20 mA cm−2 and an FF of 61.9%. The devices with PBTTDPP-TT as an acceptor and P3HT as a donor can attain a PCE of 0.28%. The optimized device that uses PBTTDPP-2FBT as a donor can obtain a PCE of 5.62%, with Voc of 0.794 V, Jsc of 10.38 mA cm−2 and an FF of 68.2%. The devices with PBTTDPP-TT as an acceptor and P3HT as a donor can attain a PCE of 0.44%. These results are probably due to unmatched energy levels between P3HT and DPP-polymers. Phase separations are difficult to control in P3HT:PBTTDPP-TT and P3HT:PBTTDPP-2FBT based OSCs. The phase separation of P3HT:PBTTDPP-TT/PBTTDPP-2FBT might not be favourable for charge transport because P3HT performs poorly with additives and needs long thermal annealing.
The higher Jsc of about 16.20 mA m−2 for PBTTDPP-TT-based PSCs compared with that of PBTTDPP-BT-based devices is due to the much wider absorption band of PBTTDPP-TT-based PSC based on the asymmetric molecular backbone structures. The enhancement of the absorption coefficient increases the Jsc values. A broad and near-unity spectral range of 300–850 nm can be acquired precisely in the EQE results shown in Fig. 4. These observations are in good agreement with the UV-vis absorption spectra for the polymers shown in Fig. 1. The Jsc values calculated from the EQE curve are approximately 13.94, 15.31 and 10.44 mA cm−2 for PBTTDPP-BT, PBTTDPP-TT and PBTTDPP-2FBT-based devices, respectively. The detailed device performance of PBTTDPP-BT-, PBTTDPP-TT- and PBTTDPP-2FBT-based OFETs and OSCs are summarized in Tables 2 and 3, respectively. The inappropriate match of LUMO with PC71BM could be a contributing factor for the reduction in Jsc for PBTTDPP-2FBT-based PSCs, similar to those of PPyDPP-TT-based PSCs.24 This phenomenon suggests that the very narrow band gap materials (ca. 1.30–1.45 eV) cannot act as donors successfully with fullerene derivatives if their energy levels cannot be matched effectively.

Solid state structures and film morphology characterisations
Grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) was performed on the blend polymer films to investigate the molecular stacking and orientations of the active layers of PBTTDPP-BT, PBTTDPP-TT and PBTTDPP-2FBT in the devices (Fig. 5). The polymers were compared using a Gaussian fit model as a guideline for a broad comparative analysis. The full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the (100) diffraction peaks of the blend film of PBTTDPP-BT, PBTTDPP-TT and PBTTDPP-2FBT in the out-of-plane direction are 0.07375, 0.08584 and 0.07858, respectively. These results suggest the highest crystallinity of PBTTDPP-BT that could lead to the excessive phase separation. The FWHM of the (010) diffraction peaks for the blend films of PBTTDPP-TT and PBTTDPP-2FBT in the out-of-plane direction are 0.22996 and 0.25734, respectively. The intensity of the (010) diffraction peak for the blend film of PBTTDPP-BT is too weak to be observed. This phenomenon indicates that PBTTDPP-TT could have a slight effect on the face-on structure. The FWHMs of the (100) diffraction peaks for the blend film of PBTTDPP-BT, PBTTDPP-TT and PBTTDPP-2FBT in the in-plane direction are 0.36454, 0.28266 and 0.26816, respectively. These characteristics could explain why PBTTDPP-2FBT exhibits the most distinct edge-on structure that is not favourable for the charge transport. The face-on structure and suitable phase separation of the blend film of PBTTDPP-TT may facilitate the fabrication of high-performance optoelectronic devices based on PBTTDPP-TT thin films.

Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were performed to verify the discrepancies in the morphologies of the blend films of PBTTDPP-BT, PBTTDPP-TT and PBTTDPP-2FBT (Fig. 6). PBTTDPP-TT-based blend thin films have mixed microstructure morphology with a root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of ca. 1.37 nm. In contrast, the blend thin films based on PBTTDPP-BT and PBTTDPP-2FBT display a surface morphology of nanoparticles with a size of approximately hundreds of nanometers and increased RMS values of ca. 2.23 nm and ca. 2.32 nm, respectively. The TEM images show that two components in the PBTTDPP-TT-based blend thin films do not form an evident nanofiber, whereas the blend thin films based on PBTTDPP-BT and PBTTDPP-2FBT exhibit distinct nanofiber structures. These differences could explain the highest Jsc of PBTTDPP-TT, which should be attributed to the most suitable phase separation to enlarge the interfacial area for effective charge separation.

AFM and TEM images of the blend films are depicted in Fig. 7 to compare the discrepancies in their morphologies. The roughness values of the PBTTDPP-BT, PBTTDPP-TT and PBTTDPP-2FBT-based blend thin films with P3HT are higher than those of the blend films of PBTTDPP-BT, PBTTDPP-TT and PBTTDPP-2FBT with PC71BM. This phenomenon explains the very low PCE of all-polymer solar cells. The blend films of PBTTDPP-BT with P3HT do not have a PCE value. However, nanoparticles with the size of approximately hundreds of nanometers are found in the PBTTDPP-2FBT-based blend thin films with P3HT and these thin films could have better phase separation. This result indicates that in all-polymer solar cells, modifying the phase separation may enhance charge separation and transport for higher PCE.

Conclusions
In this study, three new asymmetric thiophene/benzothiophene-flanked DPP-based copolymers, namely PBTTDPP-BT, PBTTDPP-TT and PBTTDPP-2FBT, were designed and synthesized to achieve ambipolar polymers for high-performance polymer optoelectronic devices. These polymers exhibited narrow band gaps (below 1.5 eV) with a wide absorption range (500–850 nm). Studies on OFETs based on their thin films exhibited typical ambipolar charge transport properties with hole mobilities of 1.20, 1.68 and 1.50 cm2 V−1 s−1 for PBTTDPP-BT, PBTTDPP-TT and PBTTDPP-2FBT, respectively. The corresponding electron mobilities were 0.40, 0.14 and 0.35 cm2 V−1 s−1. These characteristics allowed the polymer to act as both donor and acceptor materials in PSCs. PSCs with PBTTDPP-BT, PBTTDPP-TT and PBTTDPP-2FBT as donor materials blended with PC71BM as the acceptor could reach PCEs of 5.59%, 6.96% and 5.62%, respectively. PSCs with PBTTDPP-TT and PBTTDPP-2FBT as acceptor materials blended with P3HT as the donor could only reach PCE values of 0.28% and 0.44%, respectively. These results demonstrate that DPP polymers with asymmetry in the flanking aromatic rings have narrow band gaps and wide absorption bands. However, the energy levels of these asymmetric thiophene/benzothiophene-flanked DPP-based copolymers do not match ideally with PC71BM or P3HT, which inhibits the fabrication of high-performance PSCs. Hence, further studies should be performed to achieve better phase separation. Ensuring an ideal match between the donor and acceptor would increase the PCEs of polymer/fullerene PSCs and all-polymer solar cells.
