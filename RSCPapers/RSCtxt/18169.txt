Introduction
In the context of continued growth in global energy demand (2.3% per year), fossil fuel storage is clearly inadequate. In addition, the burning of fossil fuels has caused a serious greenhouse effect. The transformation from non-renewable energy to sustainable clean energy has become inevitable. At present, among many clean energy sources, solar energy stands out due to its abundant resources and high energy, and is becoming the most promising renewable clean energy.1–3 Solar photovoltaic technology has become a new industry with universal attention and key development in all countries of the world, possessing the advantages of safety, no pollution, and power supply source for remote rural residents.4–6 The molecular photovoltaic cells, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), can generate power under weak light conditions, are minimally affected by the surrounding climate, have a simple preparation process, and are flexible and colorful. A lot of effort has been made to enhance the photoelectric conversion efficiency of DSSCs, such as the morphology engineering of photoanodes, the doping of precious metal or non-metal elements in photoanodes, and the construction of heterojunctions.7–10
Two-dimensional (2D) heterostructures have exhibited many dramatic photo-electrochemical properties for energy conversion and storage, particularly the molecular-scale heteroassembled superlattices that use different 2D monolayer nanosheets as building blocks. Great efforts have been made to incorporate unilamellar nanosheets into a unique type of artificial construction, noted as superlattices or 2D heterostructures.11–14 Superlattices are composed of either monodisperse nanoparticles or alternately arranged 2D monolayer nanosheets. Various properties emerge when the different 2D materials are incorporated into one.13 The re-distribution of electric charge and structural changes might take place between the neighboring layers in the material. Accordingly, the synergetic effects between various 2D monolayer nanosheets endow such 2D superlattices with many amazing properties for applications in the field of optoelectronics.14
Different from traditional zero-dimension (0D) and one-dimensional (1D) building units, 2D materials have strong intermolecular van der Waals forces, and excellent physical and chemical properties, which provide unique unilamellar configuration assembly units for the preparation of 2D heterostructure materials. As one of the most extensively researched 2D monolayer nanosheets, graphene is a one-carbon atom-thick monolayer, which can be obtained by exfoliating graphite. Graphene has many physical and chemical properties, such as a high specific surface area, special electronic structure, superior electron transport capability, excellent mechanical properties and very good thermal conductivity, which have attracted extensive attention from scientists.11 In addition, graphene also possesses high optical absorption properties, but its unit modulus absorption is very low, making it a powerful candidate for transparent applications. The high specific surface area makes it an excellent loading material.
Polyoxometalates (POMs), a kind of discrete inorganic anion polynuclear metal–oxygen cluster, can be regarded as soluble nanoscale (1–6 nm) oxide fragments. One of the most remarkable properties of POMs is their strong electron acceptability without changing the structure. This feature is not only in the catalyst, but also in the multilevel carrier capture storage devices. In addition, the rechargeable battery cathode active materials play an important role. The multilevel carrier capture storage devices also will have a broad prospect of applications.15,16 At the same time, POMs can undergo reversible multielectron redox reactions, which make them a key component in the storage and conversion of renewable energy.17 Heteropoly blues (HPBs) are important reactants in redox reactions and are POMs in the reductive state with fascinating structures, reversible redox properties, abundant element compositions, wide spectral absorptions, and an adjustable energy level. In addition, the formation of HPBs is a rapid and reversible reduction process. Due to the quantum size effect, the solution processability, and the multiexciton effect, they have been widely used in the field of optical biomarkers, luminescent devices, and solar cells.18 Recently, MacMillan et al. proposed a dual-function photosensitizer decatungstate anion ([W10O32]4−) with the ability of both single electron transfer and hydrogen transfer as the catalyst to realize C–H bond activation, and fracture to produce alkyl radicals.19 POMs, as a perovskite cell additive, improve the efficiency and stability of the perovskite solar cell. Yang et al. prepared SiW12–TiO2 composite mesoporous films by spin coating deposition as the electron transfer layer of perovskite cell, and the photoelectric conversion efficiency was significantly improved (14.66%) compared with that of the TiO2 thin film (PCE = 12.00%).20 Vasilopoulou et al. used Keggin and Dawson-type HPBs as the electron injection layers of organic light-emitting diodes (OLED) and electron extraction layers in organic solar cells (OPVs).21 In 2018, we studied the photosensitive properties of Keggin and Dawson HPBs by optical and optoelectronic measurement systematically in detail.22 POMs have been applied to different parts of DSSCs with some achievements, but there is still a lot of room for development. POMs are easy to aggregate, which limits their application. Therefore, the preparation of POM nanoparticles is still of great concern. The POM superlattice structure is the array of POM building blocks, which is equivalent to the monodispersion of POM nanoparticles.23
Based on the excellent properties of reduced graphene and superlattice structures, we combine their advantages into one material to make full use of their strengths. Herein, we studied the photosensitive properties of HPBs based on the different reduction states of the POMs in detail. The superlattice HPB/rGO heterojunction was constructed by the solvent volatilization drive method. Based on the photosensitive property of the HPBs, the superlattice P2W18(HPB)/rGO heterojunction was first applied to the photoanode of DSSCs. Selecting two kinds of Dawson POMs as the research object, the materials were characterized by IR, UV-Vis, TG, XRD and XPS. The TEM and AFM indicated that the monolayer POM superlattice structure was successfully obtained. The superlattice P2W18(HPB)/rGO heterojunction was introduced into the DSSC photoanode, and the photoelectric conversion efficiency was improved to 8.09%. Research shows that the HPB nanoparticles are evenly dispersed in the photoanode, and the P2W18(HPB)/rGO superlattice forms a dense and highly robust self-assembled monolayer on the surface of mesoporous TiO2, which not only increases the spectral absorption and generates a high-light current, but also prevents electron transfer to the electrolyte. Notably, the DSSCs are stable for six hours under simulated full solar exposure at 60 °C.
Experimental section
Preparation of the superlattice heteropoly blue
The synthesis process of P2W15V3 heteropoly blue and P2W18 heteropoly blue is in the ESI.†24–26 The reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and TiO2 paste were used as described in the literature.27,28

Surfactant-encapsulated (SEP) POMs and HPB building block. 
[(HDA)3(TBA)3P2W18O62] was taken as the example and prepared according to literature.23,29 First, 2.5 mmol of HDA·Br and 2.5 mmol of TBA·Br were dissolved in 20 mL of CHCl3 (solution A). Second, 0.8 mmol of P2W18 was dissolved in 10 mL of water (solution B). Solution B was slowly injected into solution A with vigorous stirring. After stirring for 2 h, the mixture was centrifuged for 8 min at 11000 rpm, and the precipitate was washed five times with deionized water. The light green product was dried at room temperature for four days. Complexes (HDA)n(TBA)nP2W18O62(HPB), (HDA)4.5(TBA)4.5P2W15V3O62-I, (HDA)x(TBA)xP2W15V3O62-II, (HDA)y(TBA)yP2W15V3O62-III and (HDA)z(TBA)zP2W15V3O62-IV were prepared in the same method.


The preparation of the superlattice POMs. 
First, 5 mg of the surfactant-encapsulated POMs or HPBs was dispersed in 5 mL of acetonitrile. Then, 300 μL of 0.02 M copper acetate acetonitrile solution and 650 μL of ethyl benzoate were added to the solution. Last, 10 μL of the mixed liquid was dripped onto the nickel network, and dried under the surrounding environment conditions to form the superlattice POMs.29


Preparation of superlattice HPBs/rGO heterojunction. 
First, a 0.05 mg mL−1 liquid dispersion of rGO was coated onto a silicon wafer by the method of spin coating at the spinning speed of 3000 rpm, and then dried for 10 min at 60 °C in a vacuum drying chamber. The precursor solution (5 mg of SEPs POM or HPB, 300 μL of 0.02 M copper acetate acetonitrile solution and 650 μL of ethyl benzoate) was dripped onto the rGO film and evaporated after about 2 h under the surrounding environment condition to form the superlattice structure. Finally, the superlattice POMs/rGO was separated from the substrate by ultrasonic treatment.


Superlattice HPBs/rGO heterojunction modifies the TiO2 photoanode. 
The TiO2 photoanode was prepared according to the literature.30 A certain number (5 pieces, 10 pieces, 15 pieces, 20 pieces, 30 pieces) of silicon wafers (2 × 2 cm2) loaded with superlattice P2W18(HPB)/rGO was immersed in 10 mL of water for ultrasonic treatment for 10 min to separate the material from the silicon wafers, and dispersed in aqueous solution (labeled as a, b, c, d and e). The TiO2 photoanodes were then soaked in different concentrations of the superlattice P2W18(HPB)/rGO dispersion solution for 30 min. Finally, the P2W18(HPB)/rGO@TiO2 films were calcined at 573 K under Ar/H2 flow (volume ratio at 95%:5%) for 10 min to establish electrical contact at the heating rate of 7 °C min−1 (labeled as P2W18(HPB)/rGO@TiO2-a, P2W18(HPB)/rGO@TiO2-b, P2W18(HPB)/rGO@TiO2-c, P2W18(HPB)/rGO@TiO2-d and P2W18(HPB)/rGO@TiO2-e).


Assembly of solar cells. 
The P2W18(HPB)/rGO@TiO2 photoanodes with an active area of 0.1 cm2 were soaked in an ethanol solution of N719 for 15 h. The cell devices were prepared by assembling the photoanodes and the Pt counter electrodes in a sandwich structure, and the I3−/I− solution was used as the electrolyte.31

Results and discussion
Preparation of superlattice HPBs/rGO
In recent years, inorganic layered 2D nanomaterials with a lateral size and confined thickness, and different optical, electrical and chemical properties from ultra-thin nanocrystals and ultra-small quantum dots have had a wide range of applications.32,33 Monolayer superlattices are a new type of 2D material, which is formed by the ordered self-assembly of disperse nanoparticles. Here, based on the nanoscale size of a single POM molecule, we selected two kinds of Wells–Dawson POMs (K8H[P2W15V3O62]·9H2O and K6[a-P2W18O62]·14H2O), and obtained their different HPB reduction degrees using different reductants labeled as P2W15V3-II, P2W15V3-III, P2W15V3-IV and P2W18(HPB). The superlattice HPBs/rGO nanostructure 2D composite material was built by the self-assembly of the surfactant-encapsulated POMs (or HPBs) building block, and the preparation process is similar to that described in the literature.29 The as-prepared POMs were characterized by FTIR, XRD, UV-Vis and TG curves (Fig. S1−S3†). Because of its excellent electronic conductivity, which may promote the electron conduction of HPBs, we choose the rGO as the substrate. Additionally, the superlattice HPBs/rGO showed enhanced photoresponse properties, which may be attributed to the superlattice structure and the reduction degree of the POMs. So, the superlattice HPBs/rGO can be considered a functional material.34
Characterization of superlattice POMs
The XRD analysis and the FT-IR spectra of the as-prepared POMs show that the stability of the POM structure is maintained after it is reduced to heteropoly blue (Fig. S1 and S2†). The UV-Vis absorption spectra of the samples with the same concentration show that the absorption range gradually expands from the ultraviolet region to the visible region (Fig. S2b and S3†), indicating the formation of heteropoly blue. Table S1† shows the elemental analysis of the assembled unit (HDA)3(TBA)3P2W18O62 and the superlattice P2W18, which support the successful synthesis of the surfactant-encapsulated POMs (SEPs). Fig. 1a shows the XRD analysis of [(HDA)3(TBA)3P2W18O62], (HDA)n(TBA)nP2W18O62(HPB) and the superlattice P2W18O62 (HPB), where XRD is used to study the effect of copper ion on the structure of the POMs. The XRD patterns indicate similar peak characteristics in the three samples. However, for the superlattice P2W18O62, additional peaks in the range of 10°–20° are attributed to copper acetate hydrate (JCPDS No. 27-0145).28 These results show that the presence of copper ions does not change the structure of the POMs. The FT-IR spectra of POMs (or HPBs), SEPs POMs (or HPBs), superlattice POMs (or HPBs) and superlattice HPBs/rGO display the same characteristic peaks of P2W18 and P2W15V3 in the range of 800–1100 cm−1 (Fig. 1b and S4†).

The composition and morphology of the superlattice POMs were studied by transmission electron microscope (TEM) and energy-disperse X-ray (EDX) analysis. Fig. 2 shows the TEM images of the superlattice POMs with a different build unit. The results indicate that a large area of well-ordered superlattice was successfully obtained. The high-resolution TEM shows that the structure of the superlattice in the square nanosheet is composed of small particles (about 3 nm), which could be the total size of a Wells–Dawson POM (ca. 1 nm) and the surfactant molecule (HDA·Br ca. 2.2 nm).23,29 A similar superlattice structure can also be obtained (Fig. S5†) when the P2W15V3 building block is replaced by P2W18. The result indicates that this assembly may be related to the structure of the polyoxometalate oxygen clusters. The EDX elemental mapping analysis further proves that the superlattice structure is composed of POMs, surfactant and copper ion (Fig. 3 and S6†).

Compositions and morphologies of superlattice HPBs/rGO heterojunction
In order to extend the application of the superlattice POMs, a superlattice HPBs/rGO heterojunction was prepared by the stage-by-stage volatilization self-assembly process. An rGO with extremely high carrier mobility was selected as the flexible substrate to support the superlattice.35 An atomic force microscope (AFM) image of the synthesized rGO is shown in Fig. S7,† which clearly shows the lamellar structure and the height profiles, and indicates that the thickness of rGO is about 1.5 nm. The TEM image of the prepared rGO is presented in Fig. 4a (top); as we can see, the surface of the exfoliated rGO is transparent and folded. The AFM and TEM images indicate that the obtained rGO structure is close to that of a monolayer. A solution containing the build unit SEPs P2W18 was dripped onto a silicon wafer loaded with rGO. As the solution evaporated in the air, a POM superlattice structure was formed on the surface of rGO to further constitute a superlattice HPB/rGO heterostructure composite. The solution containing the superlattice HPB/rGO was dripped onto the supporting network to observe the structure and morphology of the heterojunction composites by TEM. Fig. 4b (top) shows the TEM image of the superlattice P2W18 (HPB)/rGO heterojunction. The surface of the rGO nanosheet is clearly decorated with the superlattice P2W18 (HPB). Multiple TEM tests showed that the superlattice was successfully assembled on the rGO substrate, with a wide range of dimensions due to the effect of the surrounding environment. In addition, we found that the superlattice structures remained firmly attached to the surface of the rGO sheet after extensive ultrasonic treatment, which indicated a strong and tight interface contact between the two heterogeneous structural components. Therefore, the TEM images clearly show the formation of a heterojunction between the superlattice polyoxometalate and rGO sheets, which is conducive to a charge transport at the interface and enhances the sensing and photocatalytic activity of the material.
 Fig. 4  Top: TEM images of rGO (a) and the superlattice P2W18 (HPB)/rGO (b). Bottom: AFM image of the superlattice P2W18 (HPB)/rGO (c). 
The AFM test is used to measure the thickness of the superlattice on the surface of rGO. Fig. 4c shows that the thickness of the superlattice is in the range of 3.82–3.35 nm, which is similar to the sum of the diameters of the Dawson POMs (1.2 nm) and HDA·Br (2.2 nm).36 It is further demonstrated that the superlattice/rGO heterojunction is constructed from a monolayer superlattice and rGO. In short, the heterostructure of the superlattice/rGO is obtained by placing a monolayer superlattice on a single or small layer of rGO, which conforms to the basic principles of the van der Waals heterostructure.37 The only difference between the traditional van der Waals heterostructure is that the monolayer POM superlattice is not an isolated atomic plane. X-ray diffraction is a structural characterization tool. The lattice spacing of different POM superlattices was analyzed by small-angle X-ray diffraction measurements (Fig. 5a). The results indicate that the same lattice spacing was obtained in the superlattice structures of different Dawson POMs with the same alkyl chain length.

The element composition and valence of the superlattice HPB/rGO heterojunction composite were characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).38,39 The HPBs in the superlattice HPB/rGO heterojunction composites can be directly identified by monitoring the central metal valence by XPS. Fig. 5(b–d) is the full XPS spectrum of the P2W18/rGO heterojunction and the high-resolution XPS spectra of P2W18/rGO and P2W18 (HPB)/rGO, which illustrate that the composites contain W, P, Cu, O and N elements, proving that the surfactants are involved in the superlattice construction. In addition, the existence of the Cu element can be explained by the particular electrostatic adsorption forces of the Cu2+ ions with the positive charge and POMs with the negative charge. The binding energies of W 4f7/2 and W 4f5/2 are 35.7 ± 0.05 eV and 37.8 ± 0.05 eV, respectively (Fig. 5c), which correspond to the oxidation state W6+.40 There are two obvious peaks at the lower binding energy W 4f7/2 = 34.8 eV and W 4f5/2 = 36.9 eV, respectively, belonging to the W5+ ions, indicating the formation of the superlattice HPBs (Fig. 5d).41 The XPS spectra of the superlattice HPBs P2W15V3-II/rGO, P2W15V3-III/rGO and P2W15V3-IV/rGO show that some W and V atoms exist in a reductive state in the superlattice HPB composite (Fig. S9†). Fig. S10† shows the XPS spectra of Cu 2p for the superlattice POMs, which prove that the copper ion is involved in the construction of the superlattice POM structure.
Optical properties of superlattice HPB/rGO heterojunction
The HPBs in the superlattice HPB/rGO nanomaterial are encapsulated by surfactants, which improve the stability of HPB and provide a guarantee for studying the photosensitivity of heteropoly blue. Surface photovoltage technique (SPV) can be used to obtain more information about electron transfer and carrier separation on the surface and interface of a material. Fig. 6 shows the SPV spectra of different superlattice materials on the FTO. The order of the SPV response was P2W15V3-I (0.5 μV) < P2W15V3-III (2.6 μV) < P2W15V3-IV (4.7 μV) < P2W15V3-II (7.5 μV), and the range of the SPV response was gradually widened. This indicates that more carrier separation and electron transfer occurred with increasing degree of POM reduction (Fig. 6a). The SPV response of the superlattice HPB/rGO is higher than the superlattice HPB, while the SPV response of the superlattice POM/rGO is higher than the superlattice POM (Fig. 6b and Fig. S11†). Photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy is another effective method to detect the photoelectron–hole recombination rate and surface defects of the material. Fig. 6c and d show the PL spectra of different superlattice and superlattice/rGO materials on the FTO at 280 nm excitation wavelength. The formation of oxygen vacancies (defect) results in the lower binding energy of W 4f or Mo 3d in the metal oxide,42 while the PL intensity will rise with the increase of the defect density because of the radioactive recombinations of the free electrons with holes around the surface oxygen atomics. However, the “blue” electrons of the HPBs are delocalized in the different metal centers of the anion structure, which is different from the metal oxide. Fig. 6c shows that the pure P2W15V3-I exhibits two emission peaks at 375 nm and 575 nm. The high-intensity fluorescence emission peak at 375 nm is related to the recombination of weakly captured electrons and hole pairs, while the low-intensity fluorescence emission band at 575 nm is considered the band edge emission. The PL intensity of the reduced P2W15V3 superlattice is significantly lower than that of the corresponding oxidation state P2W15V3 superlattices, and the PL intensity gradually decreased with increasing reduction degree.43Fig. 6d indicates that the PL intensity changes of the pure P2W18 superlattice, P2W18 (HPB) superlattice and superlattice P2W18 (HPB)/rGO heterojunction all perform the same trend. The SPV spectra and PL spectra of the superlattice P2W15V3-I and superlattice P2W15V3-I/rGO heterojunctions are shown in Fig. S11,† which shows that the SPV response of the superlattice/rGO heterojunction (2.8 μV) is 3.5 times than that of P2W15V3-I and the PL intensity is lower than that of superlattice P2W15V3-I.

A standard three-electrode system was used to measure the photochemical activity of the superlattice composites (100 W xenon lamp as the light source and 0.5 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution as the electrolyte), Fig. 7 shows the photoresponse–time curves of rGO, superlattice P2W15V3-I, superlattice P2W18 and the corresponding superlattice HPBs/rGO heterojunction. The photocurrent density of the superlattice HPBs/rGO heterojunction is significantly enhanced compared with rGO (0.82 μA) and P2W15V3-I (1.3 μA); the order is P2W15V3-III/rGO (2.9 μA) < P2W15V3-II/rGO (3.75 μA) < P2W15V3-IV/rGO (4.3 μA), P2W18 (1.4 μA) < P2W18 (HPB) (2.5 μA) < P2W18 (HPB)/rGO (5 μA). This shows that the superlattice HPBs/rGO heterojunction composite has a faster interfaced electron transport velocity and lower charge transfer resistance.

Application of superlattice HPB/rGO heterojunction in DSSCs
The EDX mapping of the superlattice P2W18 (HPB)/rGO heterojunction-modified TiO2 anode film is shown in Fig. S11,† which shows that the elements of Ti, P, W, C and N are uniformly distributed on the surface of TiO2, indicating that the superlattice P2W18 (HPB)/rGO heterojunction is successfully loaded onto the TiO2 photoanode. The DSSC devices were assembled by combining pure TiO2, P2W18(HPB)@TiO2 and superlattice P2W18(HPB)/rGO@TiO2 with the N719 photosensitizer. Fig. 8a shows the photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves of the DSSCs with different concentrations of the superlattice P2W18(HPB)/rGO heterojunction-modified TiO2 photoanodes. The test results indicate that the optimal photoanode composition of the cell is the superlattice P2W18(HPB)/rGO@TiO2-d, which may be due to the increased content of the superlattice P2W18(HPB)/rGO heterojunction and the extension of the visible light absorption range, resulting in the increased photocurrent. The J–V curves of the DSSCs are shown in Fig. 8b with TiO2, P2W18(HPB)@TiO2 and superlattice P2W18(HPB)/rGO@TiO2 as the photoanodes. These curves illustrate that the PCE of the DSSCs (with the superlattice P2W18(HPB)/rGO@TiO2 as the photoanodes) is higher than that of TiO2 and P2W18(HPB)@TiO2 as the anodes. The corresponding photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table S2,† and we have included the error in the table from five parallel experiments. The short-circuit current density (Jsc) increased from 15.20 mA cm−2 (pure TiO2) to 15.92 mA cm−2 (P2W18(HPB)@TiO2) and 18.50 mA cm−2 (superlattice P2W18(HPB)/rGO@TiO2), and the open-circuit voltage (Voc) increased from 0.68 V (pure TiO2) to 0.75 V (P2W18(HPB)@TiO2) and 0.74 V (superlattice P2W18(HPB)/rGO@TiO2). Fig. 8c shows the J–V curves under dark conditions, indicating that the superlattice P2W18(HPB)/rGO heterojunction reduces the electron recombination to some extent. The increase of Voc may be due to the addition of the superlattice P2W18(HPB)/rGO heterojunction to reduce the carrier combination in the TiO2/dye/electrolyte Interface. With the addition of the superlattice P2W18(HPB)/rGO content, the Jsc and Voc will then decrease, which may be because of the influence of POMs on the device.

The monochromatic incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) was used to investigate the enhancement reason of the Jsc value.44Fig. 9a shows the spectral response of the IPCE for the DSSCs with different photoanodes. The positions of the IPCE photocurrent response is consistent with the corresponding visible absorption spectra, as shown in Fig. 9b. For the N719 sensitized pure TiO2 batteries, the highest IPCE value is ∼48% between 350–730 nm, but the DSSCs of the N719-sensitized superlattice P2W18(HPB)/rGO@TiO2 show a wider response range (350–750 nm) and a higher IPCE value at ∼67%. The results show that the superlattice P2W18(HPB)/rGO heterojunction as collaborative co-sensitizer not only can accelerate the electron transfer in the anode but also can absorb more sunlight and convert. The open circuit voltage decay curve was used to research the recombination occurrences of excited electrons and electrolytes.45,46Fig. 8d shows that the DSSCs with superlattice P2W18(HPB)/rGO@TiO2 as the anode had a slower open-circuit voltage decay than pure TiO2, indicating a slower recombination rate of the excited electrons and electrolytes. The results show that the introduction of the superlattice P2W18(HPB)/rGO heterojunction into the photoanode of DSSCs will lead to a longer electron life.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was used to study the intrinsic mechanism of the enhanced performance of DSSCs that the superlattice P2W18(HPB)/rGO and N719 co-sensitized.47 The EIS curves were fitted by the Z-view software, and the Nyquist plots and Bode phase plots are shown in Fig. 9c and d. The obtained electrochemical parameters are listed in Table S3,† indicating that the Rct value of the DSSC N719-sensitized P2W18(HPB)/rGO@TiO2 is higher than that of the N719-sensitized pure TiO2 battery. Since Rct is inversely proportional to the recombination rate, a larger Rct value indicates a smaller recombination rate of electrons, which results in a smoother electron transport across the photoanode. When P2W18(HPB)/rGO is added to the photoanode, the Rct value will increase, which indicates that P2W18(HPB)/rGO can inhibit the electron recombination of the TiO2/N719/electrolyte interface. However, if the amount of P2W18(HPB)/rGO continues to increase, this leads to the decrease of Rct value. This may be because the excessive P2W18(HPB)/rGO aggregates in the inner part of the device to prevent electron transfer. Fig. S13† shows the variation curve of various performance parameters of DSSCs that were modified by the P2W18(HPB)/rGO heterojunction with time. It can be seen that the DSSCs have high stability. After being placed for a period of time, the performance parameters of the battery did not change significantly.
Conclusion
In summary, the superlattice HPB/rGO heterojunction nanomaterial was prepared by the solvent volatilization drive method. Two kinds of Dawson structure POMs in different reduction states were used to research the photosensitive property of heteropoly blue, and the effect of the superlattice structure HPB on the DSSC performance. TEM and AFM characterization indicated that the monolayer superlattice structure was successfully obtained. The fluorescence spectrum and surface photovoltage spectra were used to research the optical performance of the superlattice HPB/rGO heterojunction, and the photoelectric response was tested. Finally, the superlattice P2W18(HPB)/rGO heterojunction was introduced into the DSSCs, and the photoelectric conversion efficiency improved to 8.09%. The research shows that the introduction of a superlattice structure makes the HPB nanoparticles evenly dispersed in the anode, which not only increases the spectral absorption, but also reduces the electron–hole recombination.
