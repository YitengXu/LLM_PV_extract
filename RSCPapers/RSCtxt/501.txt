    , Accepted 18th June 2020First published on 19th June 2020AbstractHydrated vanadium oxides (HVOs) are promising (extrinsic) pseudocapacitive materials that extend the possibility to optimize electrochemical performance through fine-tuning their nanoscale porosity, structural disorder and conventional composition. These materials demonstrate the features of batteries (i.e. high energy density) and supercapacitors (fast power output). However, most pseudocapacitive oxides are characterized by poor conductivity, which leads to high electrode resistance. Herein, an amorphous-like carbon-integrated vanadium oxide hydrate (V5O12·0.4H2O, CHVO) is engineered using a straightforward solvothermal approach, with improved conductivity, rich pore architecture and readily available nanoscale redox-active sites. The CHVO material shows superior performance as an anode in Li-ion batteries with a specific capacity of 1175 mA h g−1 at 50 mA g−1 in the 150th cycle, which was maintained to 525 mA h g−1 over 600 cycles at 1000 mA g−1. The half-cell can be charged to 403 mA h g−1 (1451 C g−1) at 4000 mA g−1 in ∼6 min. The cyclic voltammetry analysis shows that CHVO undergoes an electrochemical activation by forming a stable lithium vanadium oxide in the initial cycles. The research on electrochemical de(lithiation) mechanism of HVOs at low potentials (<1 V) is largely unexplored. In this context, real time measurements using in situ Transmission Electron Microscopy are provided to underpin the Li-ion transport process in CHVO electrodes. It is revealed that the carbon framework and peculiar structure of CHVO effectively buffer large volume expansions upon (de)lithiation. In addition, ex situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and X-ray Diffraction measurements were collectively utilized to uncover a conversion-type reaction mechanism.
Introduction
Pseudocapacitive energy storage materials have enormous potential for future high energy density and fast charging lithium ion batteries (LIBs).1–4 Although pseudocapacitive materials such as RuO2 and MnO2 have been known for several decades, there is a new resurgence in this research area owing to the advancement in synthetic routes and understanding of electrochemical properties of novel nanostructured materials.1,5,6 It's no wonder that today's world is deeply reliant on LIBs for the reliable operation of portable electronic devices, such as mobile phones, portable computers, tablets, fitness trackers, wireless speakers, smart watches and various clinical devices.7–9 On top of that, Li-ion technologies are the preferred choice to store renewable energy (i.e. wind, solar, tidal etc.) and power modern plug-in electric vehicles.10–12 In this respect there is not only a huge call for materials with high energy density, but also for high power density materials that are capable of fast charging for the seamless operations of aforementioned devices. Most LIB electrode materials display high energy density, however, they store energy through rather sluggish diffusion limited faradaic reactions, resulting in slow power output and poor cycling stability.1 Conversely, electrical double layer capacitors (EDLCs or supercapacitors) store energy via the formation of electrical double layers at/or near the surface without faradaic reactions, often leading to high power density and fast charging capabilities.13 However, EDLCs are characterized by low energy density.1 This is where pseudocapacitive materials could play a pivotal role.
An intriguing phenomenon comes to light when the charge storage in electrode materials originates from redox reactions but displays the electrochemical signature of a capacitive electrode.14,15 Termed as pseudocapacitive, these materials are characterized by fast surface-controlled redox reactions that occur at/or near surface, which leads to both high energy and power density. Hence, there is a strong rationale to develop and study pseudocapacitive electrode materials.
The pseudocapacitive property could be intrinsic (a bulk property of the material), as in the case of RuO2·xH2O,16 MnO2,17 H2Ti6O13 (ref. 18) and Nb2O5,19 or it could be extrinsic, like V2O5,20 LiCoO2,21 and MoO2.22 Typically, the extrinsic pseudocapacitive response can be triggered by decreasing the size of active materials,21,22 nano-structuring to create functional morphologies with rich pore architecture,23,24 high surface areas,1,20,25 incorporation of crystal water into the structure and amorphization of materials.2,5,6 Among these transition metal oxides, vanadium oxide-based materials are quite attractive, owing to their rich chemistry and multiple electrochemically accessible oxidation states (V5+, V4+, V3+ and V2+).26 Specifically, hydrated vanadium oxide (HVO) gels have low density, controllable nanoscale pores, rich defect chemistry and appreciable surface area, thus making them highly desirable to intensify surface-controlled capacitive effects.27,28 Although frequently denoted as ‘V2O5·xH2O gels’ (aerogel, xerogel or ambigel, depending on the solvent drying method) in literature, the valency in HVO is in fact a mixture of V4+/V5+, owing to some reduction of V5+ during the sol–gel process used to prepare these materials.29,30 Typically, HVO gels are prepared by: (i) hydrolysis and condensation of vanadium alkoxides; (ii) acidification of vanadate solutions followed by polymerization; and (iii) melt quenching processes.30,31 However, the Li storage ability in vanadium oxides is hampered by poor electronic conductivity and slow ion diffusion.32 Conductive additives, such as carbon nanotubes, graphene and conducting organic polymers (e.g. polyaniline) have been combined during the synthesis of HVO to boost the electronic conductivity of these materials.28,30,33 Although, electrochemical Li storage in V2O5 and HVO gels is well studied at potentials above 1 V, the performance and detailed analysis of these materials at low potentials (<1 V) are largely unexplored.26,30,34–36 Augustyn and Dunn26 studied the low potential lithiation of vanadium oxide aerogels and noted the formation of VO and Li2O at low potentials; delivering a specific capacity of 1000 mA h g−1 at 118 mA g−1 in 50 cycles. Another study detected the formation of Li2O upon Li insertion into V2O5 xerogels at low potentials using X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS).37 They also observed the partial reduction of V5+ to V4+ and V3+ upon Li insertion and indicated the possible formation of V2O3 (at <1 V). These observations suggest the possibility of a decomposition or conversion mechanism in LixV2O5 formed at high potentials (>1.5 V). Such processes (decomposition or conversion), if reversible, would be highly desirable to realize a higher capacity in these materials.
Design and fabrication of pseudocapacitive material-based, high rate electrodes with enhanced conductivity and desired nano-porosity is still challenging.6,38 It is anticipated that colloidal synthetic routes would be invaluable to produce and expand the range of numerous extrinsic pseudocapacitive materials (such as HVO) with enhanced electrochemical performance.1
Therefore, in the present study, we have proposed an innovative and unique approach to prepare a carbonaceous framework/HVO (CHVO) composite as a LIB anode material. The carbonaceous component was formed in situ using a glycol-assisted colloidal synthetic route followed by annealing under inert conditions and subsequent ageing in a humidity-controlled chamber at room temperature. The composite material has a peculiar morphology, characterized by long range disorder, ultrathin layers, nanoscale cavities and a continuous conductive carbon network; ideal for surface-controlled capacitive processes. As expected, this material displayed superior Li storage, long-range cycling stability and high rate capability when cycled between 0.01 and 3 V vs. Li+/Li, a voltage window largely unexplored for HVO materials. CV kinetic analysis suggests that mechanism of charge storage is mainly capacitive. Importantly, systematic in situ TEM experiments were conducted to unveil morphological and structural changes to the CHVO material during (de)lithiation in real time. All characterization techniques (CV, in situ TEM, XPS and XRD) were collectively used to underpin the electrochemical activation in CHVO and Li-ion transport kinetics.
Results and discussion
Materials synthesis and characterization
Carbon-integrated, hydrated vanadium(IV, V) oxide (CHVO) was synthesized using a simple two-step process. A schematic representation of the synthesis procedure is depicted in Fig. 1a. Initially, a vanadyl glycolate complex (VGC) was prepared by reacting the vanadium salt (vanadium(III) acetylacetonate) with ethylene glycol via a solvothermal refluxing approach at 160 °C. The temperature required to prepare a vanadyl glycolate precursor complex with a sheet-like morphology was carefully selected based on our previous work on the preparation of metal glycolates.39 The XRD pattern of as obtained purple color VGC product is shown in Fig. S1a.† The XRD pattern matches well against a monoclinic crystal phase of vanadyl glycolate (PDF: 00-049-2497). As seen in the SEM images in Fig. S2,† VGC product consists of flake-like layered structures with smooth surfaces, 100–300 nm in width and lengths of up to 600 nm. Metal glycolates could be used as a precursor for the systematic synthesis of carbon-integrated functional metal oxides with peculiar morphologies.39,40 In the present study, VGC can be readily transformed to carbon integrated cubic phase vanadium(III) oxide (C–V2O3, PDF: 01-078-7574, Fig. 1b) by heating the precursor complex in an Ar atmosphere at 500 °C for 30 min (the lowest temperature required to form C–V2O3 was determined using an in situ XRD heating experiment – Fig. S1b†). A minor rhombohedral phase of V2O3 was also identified in the XRD pattern (PDF: 04-006-8178). The black colored C–V2O3 product has a yolk–shell flake-like morphology (Fig. 1d). During the annealing process, glycolate moieties carbonized and integrated carbon species into the nanostructure. Fig. S3† shows the DF-STEM image and EDX mapping of V2O3 flakes, showing the distribution of V, O and C in the nanostructure. It should be noted here that V2O3 is quite unstable under atmospheric conditions and slowly transforms to higher oxidation states of vanadium. As such, the moisture and oxygen sensitivity of V2O3 flakes were methodically capitalized upon to transform V2O3 to a carbon-integrated partially hydrated vanadium oxide (CHVO) form in a humidity-controlled chamber (25 °C, air, RH 55%). Fig. 1e and f shows low and high magnification SEM images of CHVO, respectively. The general flake-like morphology was preserved; however, the yolk–shell structure has entirely transformed to a featureless product. The dimensions of CHVO flakes are comparable to those of VGC and C–V2O3 flakes. Fig. 1c displays the XRD of as synthesized CHVO. The major XRD peaks at ∼6.8 and 26.1° 2θ are matched to monoclinic navajoite phase of V5O12·6H2O (PDF: 00-045-1401), and Pawley refinement of these peaks revealed the c axis value to be 12.8 Å. The obtained CHVO phase is very likely of V5O12·nH2O form, and the possible formation mechanism is as follows: (i) 10V2O3 + 9O2 → 4V5O12 followed by (ii) V5O12 + nH2O → V5O12·nH2O. However, as noticeable in the XRD pattern, the material is amorphous-like, and is quite similar to aerogels of vanadium pentoxide fibrous filaments reported previously.29 Hence, the composition and structure of CHVO requires further analysis using techniques such as TEM (SAED), TGA and XPS (noted below).

(d) SEM image of C–V2O3 (inset shows a magnified SEM image). (e) SEM image of the CHVO product. (f) High magnification SEM image of CHVO showing its flake-like structure. 
TEM image in Fig. 2a provides further evidence for the yolk–shell flake-like morphology of C–V2O3, where, ∼16–18 nm V2O3 nanoparticles are dispersed in an interconnected and conductive carbon network (elemental analysis of C–V2O3 is presented in Fig. S3†). The SAED pattern from C–V2O3 confirms the crystalline nature of this material. Diffraction spots corresponding to (211), (222), (440) and (622) planes of V2O3 were clearly identified (inset of Fig. 2a). Remarkably, after exposure to moisture and air, except for the general flake-like shape, the structure and morphology of the material completely changed, the nanoparticles transformed to flakes with smooth surfaces to form CHVO (Fig. 2b). The SAED pattern has diffused rings (inset of Fig. 2b) which are signature of the amorphous-like phase (lack of long-range order) of the CHVO material. The HRTEM image further validates the structural disorder and shows that the material surface is composed of continuous and inter-linked nanoscale channels as well as pores (Fig. 2c – it should be noted that, TEM imaging was performed at a low electron dose to preserve structural water within the material). Such structural features are expected to reduce the density and offer continuous and uninterrupted channels for fast transport of Li-ions toward electrochemically active sites while mitigating the large volume expansions upon Li insertion.32 Moreover, the rich pore architecture and the amorphous-like features of CHVO are reputed to promote the pseudocapacitive behavior of the material.1,6 HRTEM imaging reveals that CHVO is indeed composed of ultrathin layers, where this layered structure is sustained by the crystal water molecules filled in between the interlayers,41,42 which would provide easy access to Li-ions. Since the in situ formed carbon network is also expected to be amorphous, it's not readily distinguishable from the vanadium oxide component (in HRTEM images). The STEM image and EDX maps in Fig. 2d show clear evidence and verify the even distribution of V, O and integrated C in the CHVO material.

TGA and DSC analyses (Fig. 3a) were performed to quantify the structural water and carbon content in the CHVO composite. The rapid initial mass loss up to 140 °C is due to the removal of loosely bound surface water molecules. The gradual mass loss of ∼1.4% from 150 °C up to 315 °C is attributed to removal of tightly bound structural water, hence ∼0.40 crystal water per formula unit of CHVO can be realized (a clear plateau region was observed after about 150 °C before the loss of structural water).43 In a related study, vanadium pentoxide hydrate (V2O5·nH2O) with superior pseudocapacitive sodium storage contained 0.55 crystal water per formula unit of V2O5·nH2O.31 The ∼4.5% mass loss at 325 °C manifests the integrated carbon content in CHVO, the loss of carbon is accompanied by an exothermic peak in the DSC curve (Fig. 3a). The TGA curve of C–V2O3 also has a mass loss at ∼325 °C, corresponding to the amount of in situ formed carbon (Fig. S4†). The uniformly distributed carbon component is pivotal for the improvement of electrical conductivity in the CHVO composite. The mass gain (∼1.8%) at ∼350 °C, accounts for the oxidation of V5O12 to V2O5 in air (the formula of vanadium oxide (V5O12) is further confirmed by XPS analysis discussed below). The endothermic peak at 684 °C in the DSC curve is assigned to the melting of V2O5. The presence and the nature of carbon in the material was confirmed by Raman spectroscopy. Fig. S5a† shows the Raman spectrum obtained from the C–V2O3 product, the Raman signals at ∼1380 cm−1 and ∼1590 cm−1 are ascribed to the D and G bands of an amorphous carbon component.44 These Raman signals were unchanged after the aging process of C–V2O3, corroborating the carbon incorporation in CHVO (Fig. S5b†). An XPS analysis was also performed to comprehend the chemical nature of vanadium and carbon in the CHVO composite. Fig. S6† displays the XPS survey spectrum of CHVO, where V, O and C species present in the composite was clearly identified. Fig. 3b shows the high resolution XPS for V 2p, which can be deconvoluted into 2 pairs of peaks. The major peaks at 517.3 eV (V 2p3/2) and 524.9 eV (V 2p1/2) are ascribed to V5+ state in CHVO and the minor peaks at 516.0 eV (V 2p3/2) and 523.8 eV (V 2p1/2) are ascribed to V4+ state. The peak area ratio between V4+ and V5+ (1:4.15), corresponds to an average oxidation state of +4.8, in line with the theoretical value for V5O12 component in CHVO.41 The C 1s high resolution XPS of CHVO shows a major peak at 284.4 eV, that can be attributed to the C–C bonds of amorphous carbon network, and the minor peaks at high binding energies are due to adventitious carbon contamination (Fig. 3c). XPS analysis, together with TGA, XRD, TEM and EDX results, reaffirm the successful formation of carbon-integrated hydrated vanadium(IV, V) oxide with a molecular formula of V5O12·0.4H2O. This layered vanadium oxide with interlayer water and carbon integration is deemed to show enhanced extrinsic pseudocapacitive properties, and consequently, high Li storage and rate capability in LIBs.

Electrochemical characterisation
The Li storage properties of CHVO material were evaluated in coin-type cells (CR2032) with Li metal as the counter electrode. The specific capacity is determined based on the mass of CHVO loaded on the current collector (15 mm diameter). Fig. 4a displays the first five galvanostatic (dis)charge profiles for CHVO electrode recorded at the specific current of 50 mA g−1. In the first cycle, CHVO electrode delivered discharge and charge capacities of 1021 and 769 mA h g−1, with a remarkably high coulombic efficiency of 75.3%. The initial capacity loss of 24.7% indicates: (1) solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layer formation;45 and (2) irreversible transformations of CHVO to a lithium intercalated vanadium oxide phase (as later confirmed by CV, XRD, XPS and in situ TEM analysis), although structural water molecules were expected to reduce the interactions between Li+ and the host structure. The low irreversible capacity and high coulombic efficiency in the 1st (dis)charge can be ascribed to large electrochemical active sites of the CHVO electrode. Notably, the coulombic efficiency quickly rises to 93% in the 2nd cycle and then maintained to more than 99% after 5th cycle. Most importantly, the galvanostatic discharge/charge profiles overlap from 3rd cycle onwards, highlighting the excellent stability and reversibility of CHVO material. Fig. 4b shows the cycling performance of CHVO and C–V2O3 (before ageing) at a current of 50 mA g−1. The first discharge capacity of C–V2O3 electrode was found to be 974 mA h g−1 with a low coulombic efficiency of 50.3%. The C–V2O3 electrode further supplied a reversible specific capacity of 349 mA h g−1 in 150 cycles. In striking contrast, CHVO generated a remarkably high reversible specific capacity of 1175 mA h g−1 in 150 cycles (50 mA g−1), in fact higher than its initial discharge capacity (1021 mA h g−1). In particular, the specific capacity decreased to 709 mA h g−1 by the 10th cycle before the reversal to a gradual capacity increase until about the 100th cycle. It is envisaged that irreversible Li-ion insertion and microstructural reorganization of CHVO during the first few cycles is an electrochemical activation process, leading to improved ion transfer rates at the electrode surface. For example, Li-doped V2O5 nanowires have displayed high power and high energy densities when applied in supercapacitors, owing to improved capacitive effects and better charge transfer kinetics compared to pristine V2O5.46 Furthermore, the increase in specific capacity could be ascribed to a process known as ‘quasi-reversible’ (also known as “partially reversible”) SEI formation, an occurrence that has been observed earlier for several conversion type materials.47,48 The gel-like polymeric layer, formed via the degradation of the electrolyte improves the mechanical cohesion of active materials.49–51 The SEI layer can also supply extra sites to store Li-ions, contributing to the capacity increase.49Fig. 4c shows the superior rate capability of CHVO electrode with reversible specific capacities of 769, 778, 755, 705, 661, 600 and 481 mA h g−1 at specific currents of 50, 100, 200, 500, 1000, 2000 and 4000 mA g−1, respectively (10 cycles at each current step). At 4000 mA g−1, it took only ∼6 min to reach a specific capacity of 403 mA h g−1 (i.e. before constant voltage finish). Importantly, upon returning the current to 100 mA g−1, the specific capacity bounced back to 883 mA h g−1, then gradually increased to 1161 mA h g−1 after a total of 150 cycles, featuring the excellent rate capability of CHVO. It is quite possible that the chemical and physical events, which lead to the electrochemical activation, occur slowly at low currents, therefore, the capacity continues to rise when the current is returned to 100 mA g−1. Moreover, the discharge curves at different current rates show comparable shapes with little polarization, implying excellent charge transfer kinetics (Fig. S7†). The long-range cycling performance of CHVO was also monitored at a specific current of 1000 mA g−1 over 600 cycles. As displayed in Fig. 4d, CHVO electrode showed reversible specific capacities of 677, 675, 623, 570 and 525 mA h g−1 at 100th, 200th, 300th, 400th and 600th cycles, respectively, with a coulombic efficiency close to 100%. At the 200th cycle, the capacity retention was ∼96% relative to the second cycle. Furthermore, indicating the good cycling stability, CHVO delivered an appreciable reversible capacity of 381 mA h g−1 at a specific current of 4000 mA g−1 after 250 cycles with a capacity retention of ∼70% (Fig. 4d). As seen in Fig. 4d, there is a capacity decrease when cycling the batteries at relatively high currents. To evaluate the possible cause, a SEM analysis was performed on an electrode that has been operating for 600 cycles at 1000 mA g−1. Fig. S8† shows the SEM images of electrode material coated on Cu current collector, captured before and after cycling for 600 cycles (the small particles represent the conductive carbon in the electrode slurry). Comparison of Fig. S8a and b† reveals that there is some agglomeration or fusion of sheet-like materials during long range cycling at relatively high currents. Such material agglomeration may reduce the electrochemical performance via disrupting the migration pathways of Li ions. The electrochemical performance of the fully hydrated form of CHVO (V5O12·6H2O) was also investigated as a comparative study (refer ESI, Fig. S9†).

(c) Rate capability of CHVO from low to high currents (50 mA g−1 to 4000 mA g−1). (d) Cycling performance and stability of CHVO at high specific currents of 1000 mA g−1 and 4000 mA g−1. 
A detailed CV analysis was then performed to understand the Li storage mechanism in the CHVO electrode. In the first cathodic scan (Fig. 5a), the peaks at 2.4 V and 0.6 V can be ascribed to Li insertion into CHVO material and solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layer formation, respectively.26,52 While in the first anodic scan, the peaks at 1.9 V and 2.7 V are attributed to the Li de-insertion from the CHVO material. In the second cycle, clear and discernible redox couples at 2.4 V/2.7 V and 1.5 V/1.9 V are observed, which can be attributed to Li de(insertion) from the CHVO material. It is important to note that from the 3rd cycle, the redox couple at 2.4 V/2.7 V has completely disappeared. Moreover, the redox processes at 1.5 V/1.9 V, as seen in Fig. 5a and b are not entirely reversible and there is an obvious decrease in the response current until the 20th cycle. These observations indicate the formation of a stable lithium vanadium oxide phase within the electrode with a “nominal” composition of LixV5O12·0.4H2O (LVOH). As noted, Li-intercalated forms of vanadium oxides are expected to show better electrochemical performance owing to better charge transfer kinetics between the electrodes. Significantly, new peaks start to appear at low voltages, between 0.3 V–1.2 V in the cathodic scan and 0.5 V–1.5 V in the anodic scan, indicating further reversible redox processes in LVOH formed at high potentials. Importantly, as seen in Fig. 5c, after the initial electrochemical activation process, CV curves largely overlap demonstrating excellent reversibility of the redox reactions in the electrode material. Fig. S10† shows a CV profile (scan rate: 0.5 mV s−1) after full (dis)charge of a CHVO/Li half-cell for 50 cycles. As seen, the redox couples at low potentials have enhanced while the redox couple at 1.5 V/1.9 V has diminished. These observations further corroborate the slow formation of a stable LVOH phase within the electrode, and amplified conversion processes of LVOH occurring at low potentials. According to ex situ XPS analysis (later discussed) the lowest oxidation state detected for vanadium in the fully discharged electrode is +2. In a related study on V2O5 aerogels, the presence of +2 oxidation state was detected at complete lithiation, where LixV2O5 formed at potentials above 1.5 V was expected to undergo conversion or decomposition to V2O3, VO and Li2O at low potentials, leading to a high specific capacity.26 Almeida et al. studied the reduction of V2O5 xerogels upon Li insertion at low potentials by means of X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS).37 The formation of Li2O, and reduction of vanadium ions from V5+ to V4+ and V3+ was noted. Herein, the CV analysis of CHVO electrode implies: (i) Li insertion and formation of a stable LVOH phase upon initial cycling (this process is fast and obvious in the initial 20 cycles and slows down afterwards); (ii) reversible decomposition or conversion of LVOH to V2O3, VO and Li2O at lower potentials. The proposed mechanism is further studied using ex situ XPS, ex situ XRD and in situ TEM. The starting electrode material (CHVO) is in fact partially lithiated after the electrochemical activation, albeit for clarity, the term CHVO will be used to designate the electrode material.

It is worth noting that in this work, CHVO material was engineered in a controlled way (via hydration and amorphization) to realize a pseudocapacitive response, which facilitates high energy and high-power density. Generally, the electrochemical energy storage process could be split into three components; (i) diffusion controlled (battery-like), (ii) surface-controlled faradaic charge transfer with surface/subsurface atoms (pseudocapacitive) and (iii) nonfaradaic surface-controlled (double layer capacitor-like).53 The CV can be used to deconvolute the kinetics of charge storage, then, identify and measure the fraction of capacitive charge storage in the material. The CV response of electrochemically activated CHVO (Fig. 5c) displays broad faradaic charge-transfer peaks on a rectangular-like curve shape, a key signature of a pseudocapacitive process.14 Fig. S11† depicts the CV profiles of CHVO at varying scan rates (0.1 to 2 mV s−1). These CV profiles were collected after cycling the half-cell at 100 mA g−1 for 30 cycles. Markedly, the general shape of the CV curves is well maintained upon increasing the scan rate, implying only a small polarization at these scan rates. There is a power law relationship between the measured current (i) at a particular potential and scan rate (v) according to: i = avb, where a is a constant and b is the power-law exponent; b = 0.5 denotes a diffusion controlled faradaic charge storage mechanism and, b = 1, indicates surface controlled capacitive charge storage process.1,48,54 This equation can be rearranged to log(i) = b × log(v) + log(a), hence gradient of the plot of log(i) vs. log(v) provides the b-value. Fig. 5d shows, log(i) vs. log(v) plots for both anodic (0.76 V) and cathodic (0.55 V) peaks, with b-values of 0.95 and 0.90, respectively (the peak position is based on the 0.5 mV s−1 scan rate, assuming negligible polarization). Moreover, Fig. S12† shows log(i) vs. log(v) graphs for anodic (1.20 V) and cathodic (0.96 V) peaks with b values of 0.92 and 0.89, respectively. The high values obtained for b indicate that the charge storage mechanism in CHVO is indeed dominantly capacitive. The fraction of diffusion-controlled and capacitive contributions can be approximated by separating the current reading at a specified potential (V) as per i(V) = k1v + k2v1/2.53 The proportionality constants, k1 and k2 define capacitive and diffusion-controlled processes, respectively. The k1 value is deduced by the gradient of the plot of i(V)/v1/2vs. v1/2. The result of this evaluation for CHVO material at 1 mV s−1 scan rate is displayed in Fig. 5e, where 79% of the total charge stored came from capacitive processes. Fig. 5f shows the fraction of capacitive and diffusion-controlled contributions for other scan rates, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5 and 2 mV s−1. Remarkably, even at the slow scan rate of 0.1 mV s−1, 59% of the total charge has resulted from surface-controlled capacitive processes (Fig. S13†), and clearly the capacitive contribution has markedly increased with increasing scan rate. In addition, the total gravimetric charge (Qt) at scan rates of 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1 and 2 mV s−1 was calculated to be 2343, 2172, 1943, 1733, and 1595C g−1, respectively (see ESI† for calculation). Qt is the sum of surface-controlled capacitive charge (Qs) and diffusion-controlled charge (Qd) contributions. Qs with faster kinetics is independent of the scan rate, while Qd with slower kinetics changes with reciprocal square root of scan rate (v−1/2).20,55 Hence, Qs can be determined by the intercept of plot of Qtvs. v−1/2 according to Qt = Qs + kv−1/2 (Fig. S14†).20Qs was determined to be 1444 C g−1. The high fraction of surface-controlled capacitive charge is attributed to amorphous like structural disorder and inter-linked nanoscale pores produced at the surface of CHVO during synthesis, which accounts for the superior rate capability of this material.56,57 N2 isothermal adsorption/desorption measurements were conducted to investigate the pore architecture and surface area of the CHVO material (Fig. S15†). It is revealed that the material exhibits a typical type II adsorption isotherm,58 which is attributed to an assorted pore size distribution on the surface.59 There are two pore size groups in BJH pore distribution as seen from Fig. S15b† (2.7 nm and 22 nm). The larger pores are likely to grant a ready access to the electrolyte over the whole fine structure of CHVO material. Although BET surface area of CHVO material is low (∼17 m2 g−1), the excellent pseudocapacitive charge storage with rapid charge/discharge rates might be attributed to the reversible redox transitions of CHVO and peculiar pore architecture that provides short diffusion lengths and continuous access to the electrochemical active sites. Hence, the true charge storage mechanism in CHVO materials is faradaic in nature, which appears to be pseudocapacitive due to the surface enhancement via surface engineering and nanostructuring process.24 Similar effect was already observed for hydrated vanadium pentoxide (BET surface area: 17.6 m2 g−1) that showed superior pseudocapacitive sodium storage capability.31
EIS analysis was performed to understand the charge transfer resistance in the CHVO material. Fig. 6a shows the EIS data obtained for CHVO material before cycling and after the 1st cycle. Fig. 6b shows EIS data obtained after 10th and 20th cycles. After the first cycle the EIS patterns manifest two partly overlaid semicircles at a high to medium frequency and a sloping straight line at a low frequency, which could be fitted using an equivalent circuit, as shown in Fig. 6b.60,61Re is the cell resistance which collectively includes electrolyte, electrodes and separator resistance. Rsei (high frequency) could be ascribed to the resistance of the solid electrolyte interface (SEI).60 Noticeably, Rsei is nearly unchanged after the first cycle, which denotes the development of a stable SEI layer upon cycling. The stable SEI layer not only acts as a protective layer for the active materials but also provides extra active sites for reversible Li-ion storage.49Rct (medium frequencies) is the charge transfer resistance. It is important to note that the radius of this semicircle has significantly decreased when going from 1st to 20th cycles, indicating improved charge transfer kinetics of the CHVO material upon cycling. These observations further validate the electrochemical activation of CHVO via the formation of a LVOH phase.

Ex situ XRD and XPS and, in situ TEM analysis were then performed to underpin the structural, chemical and morphological changes of CHVO material during electrochemical cycling. As discussed in the CV analysis, initial electrochemical activation of the CHVO material takes up to 20 cycles, which then gradually continues at a slow rate. Hence, due to our interest in the electrochemically activated CHVO, both XPS and XRD data were collected after cycling the batteries for 30 cycles. As seen in Fig. S16,† the XRD pattern obtained at the 30th charge (Li-extracted) is quite different from the XRD of initial material (compare with Fig. 1c), indicating irreversible phase transformations in the initial cycles. The sharp peaks at 43.3° 2θ and 50.4° 2θ correspond to the copper substrate of the electrode. The copper peaks were fitted using a Pawley fitting method, while Rietveld refinement of a crystalline lithium vanadium oxide phase in Rm space group (PDF: 04-015-5305, Li0.86V0.8O2) agrees well with the measured pattern. It should be noted, in addition to these crystalline peaks, there are broad peaks between 10–30° 2θ, indicating that activated material is a mixture of both amorphous and crystalline phases. Hence, the true formula of the electrochemically activated form is not definitively known, hence the “nominal” composition LixV5O12·0.4H2O (LVOH) was used to represent the overall composition of the lithium vanadium oxide material within the electrochemically activated electrode. Interestingly, at the end of 31st discharge (Li-inserted) the peaks resembling the crystalline phase were still evident, hence not all crystalline lithium vanadium oxide formed at potentials above 1.5 V are converted to VO and Li2O at low potentials. CV analysis suggested the possible conversion/reduction of part of LVOH to vanadium oxides (i.e. VO) at low potentials as noted in previous literature,26 however, there was no obvious crystallographic evidence, possibly due to the presence of these oxides in amorphous state. Nonetheless, to gather more evidence, the CHVO electrodes were further analyzed using ex situ XPS. Fig. 7 shows the V 2p3/2 XPS region of the CHVO electrodes, isolated from fully charged (3.0 V), partially discharged (1.2 V) and fully discharged (0.01 V) electrodes after cycling the batteries for 30 cycles. In the fully charged state (30th charge) of the electrode, V 2p3/2 peak can be deconvoluted into two peaks centered at 517.6 and 516.5 eV, which are attributed to the +5 and +4 oxidation states of vanadium, respectively. Interestingly, the peak area ratio between V4+ and V5+ (1:1.29) corresponds to an average oxidation state of +4.5 compared to the +4.8 in the starting material, CHVO (V5O12·0.4H2O). The slightly reduced form of vanadium in the charged state undeniably indicates the irreversible Li incorporation and activation of CHVO during the initial few cycles, agreeing well with CV analysis. In the partially discharged state (1.2 V), clearly, the signal from V5+ subsided, while V4+ enhanced. Notably, there is a peak at 514.8 eV attributed to the +3-oxidation state of vanadium. When the cell is further discharged to 0.01 V, the most dominant V 2p3/2 peak is centered at 513.5 eV, attributed to +2 oxidation state of vanadium, which in fact indicates Li storage via a further reduction (conversion or decomposition) of LVOH. As noted, LVOH is expected to form at potentials above 1.5 V through intercalation of Li into nanoscale pores, as well as amorphous channels in the active material. In metal oxides, at low potentials, a large amount of Li could be stored via decomposition or conversion reactions.26 Herein, the presence of V2+ in the fully discharged electrode highlights the rich redox chemistry in the CHVO material and indicates the possible conversion of LVOH to V2O3, VO and Li2O at low potentials producing a very high capacity (formation of Li2O, later revealed by an in situ TEM study). In a related study, the high capacity in V2O5 aerogels was attributed to conversion or decomposition of LixV2O5 (formed at high potentials) to V2O3, VO and Li2O at low potentials.26
 Fig. 7  V 2p ex situ XPS data of CHVO electrodes isolated after 30 cycles at different charge states (3.0 V, 1.2 V and 0.01 V). 
An in situ TEM nanobattery device was fabricated to have a deeper understanding of morphological, structural and volume changes of CHVO material upon direct Li insertion. The peculiar morphology of amorphous CHVO, in particular, the carbon integration and numerous surface nanoscale pores are expected to render the material flexible, and thus let it withstand large volume changes during high pseudocapacitive Li storage. Fig. 8a shows a photograph of the in situ TEM holder, and its blueprint, where the sample is fixed to a fresh cut gold electrode, and the counter electrode (Li/Li2O) is attached to a tungsten wire. The two electrodes are connected to a potentiostat outside the TEM. The low magnification TEM image in Fig. 8a shows the CHVO flake selected for the in situ TEM experiments. Fig. 8b shows the CHVO flake and the SAED pattern right before lithiation. The initial width of the flake is 113 nm, and the diffuse rings of SAED pattern denote long-range disorder in CHVO. Then a voltage of −3 V vs. Li+/Li was applied to commence lithiation of CHVO. There was an instant increase in flake width, which in fact indicates ready Li uptake by CHVO (Movie S1†). As seen in Fig. 8c, after 120 s of lithiation, the width has increased from 113 to 133 nm, corresponding to a lateral extension of 17.7%. Interestingly, four rings appeared on the SAED pattern after in situ lithiation. Two of them are somewhat dispersed rings with d-spacing values of 0.206 and 0.145 nm, which are attributed to the (104) and (110)/(018) planes of crystalline lithium vanadium oxide, respectively, formed upon lithiation of CHVO. They are in fact identical to the 44° 2θ and 64° 2θ peaks shown in the ex situ XRD patterns (Fig. S16†), further verifying the existence of a crystalline lithium vanadium oxide phase in the discharged electrode, free from interference of copper signal from current collector. Intriguingly, the two sharper peaks with d-spacing values of 0.269 and 0.165 nm are attributed to the (111) and (220) planes of Li2O, respectively. This is a significant uncovering, because the presence of Li2O suggests the decomposition or conversion of part of LVOH to V2O3/VO upon greater Li storage at low potentials.26,37 The vanadium oxides in discharged state are possibly in amorphous form as per diffuse halos in SAED and broad peaks at 10–30° 2θ in ex situ XRD. Then, delithiation of CHVO was prompted by applying a voltage of +3 V vs. Li+/Li (Movie S1†). The width of the flake decreased from 133 to 122 nm, corresponding to a minor irreversible lateral expansion of 8% in the first cycle (Fig. 8d). The SAED rings corresponding to crystalline lithium vanadium oxide phase were still present, even after delithiation, in good agreement with the ex situ XRD analysis. Importantly, the SAED rings corresponding to Li2O diminished after delithiation, demonstrating the good reversibility of conversion reactions occurring at low potentials.

(b) TEM image and SAED pattern of CHVO just before in situ lithiation (red circle shows the area selected for electron diffraction). (c) TEM image and SAED obtained at 120 s point of lithiation.

Based on ex situ XPS, ex situ XRD, in situ TEM and CV analyses, the charge storage reactions for CHVO can be expressed as follows: V5O12 + xLi+ + xe− → LixV5O12(1) LixV5O12 + 2Li+ + 2e− ↔ V2O3 + Li2O(2) V2O3 + 2Li+ + 2e− ↔ VO + Li2O(3)
In the initial cycles, CHVO reacts with Li to form a stable LVOH (LixV5O12·0.4H2O) phase within the electrode according to reaction (1). The formation of stable LVOH is relatively fast in the first 20 cycles, albeit slows down afterwards. The stable LVOH phase, indeed plays a pivotal role in improving the overall conductivity and charge transfer kinetics of the electrode. Both during and after the initial electrochemical activation, reactions (2) and (3) are expected to occur. At potentials above 1.5 V, Li is intercalated into nanoscale cavities of CHVO to form LVOH. At low potentials, part of LVOH undergoes conversion reactions to form V2O3, VO and Li2O to deliver a high specific capacity. Assuming an overall conversion of V5O12 to VO, the maximum theoretical specific capacity of CHVO is estimated to be ∼807 mA h g−1 (refer ESI†). At a specific current of 50 mA g−1, CHVO material delivered a specific capacity of 1175 mA h g−1, higher than the theoretical capacity. This capacity increase could be attributed to a ‘quasi-reversible’ SEI formation, which was somewhat evident in the ex situ XPS study. For instance, V 2p signals from discharged electrodes (Fig. 7, 1.2 V and 0.01 V) were only detectable after etching the electrode surface using the Ar cluster gun in XPS (10 keV Ar1000+, 1 min). Yet the V 2p signal from fully charged electrode (Fig. 7, 3.0 V) was detectable without any etching process (Fig. S17†). This result indicates the formation of a surface layer on the lithiated electrode which is thick enough to block the V 2p XPS signal. Upon de-lithiation the surface layer formation process is (partially) reversed making the surface layer thin enough to detect the V 2p signal. These observations suggest the formation of a quasi-reversible SEI, which could generate extra capacity. Recall that the main focus of the present study is to design a vanadium oxide material with high structural disorder, rich pore architecture and flexible conductive channels to enhance the extrinsic pseudocapacitive charge storage. As predicted, the material displayed superior Li storage even at high rates. As already discussed, there is only limited evidence for the low potential lithiation of hydrated vanadium oxides. Table S1† lists the electrochemical performance of vanadium oxide-based electrodes cycled to potentials below 1 V in literature, highlighting the superior performance of CHVO material produced herein. Based on all evidence collected herein (CV, XPS, XRD and in situ TEM), CHVO chiefly stores Li via an extrinsic (redox) pseudocapacitive process. To evaluate the importance of carbon component, a comparison study was performed after removing the carbon content from CHVO by heating the sample in air. A heating temperature of 325 °C was selected based on the TGA/DSA result. Fig. S18a† shows the electrochemical performance of the material after carbon removal (HVO) at a specific current of 1000 mA g−1. This material displayed a very low specific capacity of 162.9 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles at 1000 mA g−1 as compared to 677.2 mA h g−1 of the original CHVO material. Moreover, the EIS curve of HVO (Fig. S18b†) obtained after the 20th dis(charge) cycle shows much higher charge-transfer resistance when compared to that of CHVO sample (Fig. 6b). The results obtained herein highlight the critical role played by the amorphous carbon component which finely wraps and sheaths the hydrated vanadium oxide material during in situ formation, namely: (i) improving the overall ion conductivity/Li ion diffusion in the material; (ii) providing extra functional areas for Li storage; and (iii) acting as a flexible cushion to alleviate sizable volume expansions and preserve the structural integrity of material upon storing a high content of Li-ions.
Conclusions
In summary, we developed a unique and easy to adapt approach to synthesize a vanadium(IV, V) oxide hydrate with in situ carbon formation (CHVO). Initially, V2O3 nanoparticles embedded in a carbonaceous mesoporous framework (C–V2O3) were obtained via annealing a vanadyl glycolate complex, then systematic oxidation, hydration and amorphization of C–V2O3 in a humidity-controlled chamber resulted in the composite CHVO material. CHVO is featured by several desirable characteristics, such as long-range structural disorder, ultrathin layers and many surface cavities and nanoscale pores ideal for extrinsic pseudocapacitive Li storage. As expected, CHVO material displayed superior Li storage performance with high reversible specific capacities of 1175 and 1161 mA h g−1 at specific currents of 50 and 100 mA g−1, respectively. The outstanding cycling stability was evident when CHVO displayed a reversible capacity of 525 mA h g−1, at 1000 mA g−1 (in the 600th cycle), and excellent rate capability and high rate cyclability with 481 mA h g−1 at 4000 mA g−1. Kinetic analysis of charge storage by CV study revealed that fast Li storage in CHVO is owing to a significant pseudocapacitive contribution. Although hydrated vanadium oxides are largely explored at high potentials, lithium storage mechanism at low potentials is largely unexplored. Based on an extensive investigation using CV, ex situ XRD and ex situ XPS, we found that CHVO material undergoes an electrochemical activation process by forming a stable lithium vanadium oxide phase in the initial few cycles leading to better charge transfer kinetics in the long run. In addition, combining with in situ TEM analysis, we propose that reaction mechanism involves the reversible decomposition/conversion of lithium vanadium oxide formed at potentials greater than 1.5 V to VO and Li2O at low potentials yielding a high specific capacity. Furthermore, as revealed by in situ TEM, the unique morphology and carbon framework of CHVO resist large volume expansion upon dense Li storage, not to mention that carbon constituent also improves the overall conductivity of material. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to report in situ TEM measurements for a hydrated vanadium oxide. The superior pseudocapacitive Li storage in CHVO affirms that it's a promising electrode material for future high energy and power density LIBs. Significantly, the vanadyl glycolate and C–V2O3 inspired synthesis route reported herein offers a simple and efficient approach to tackle the poor conductivity and volume expansion problems in functional (extrinsic) pseudocapacitive energy storage materials.
Materials and methods
Synthesis of carbon integrated hydrated vanadium(IV, V) oxide (CHVO)
At first, 2.08 g of bluish color vanadyl acetylacetonate was mixed with 44 mL of ethylene glycol in a round bottomed flask. This mixture was heated to 80 °C under magnetic stirring to dissolve the vanadyl acetylacetonate. Then, 6 mL of oleylamine was added to the mixture and heated further up to 160 °C under reflux. After 4 h the heating was stopped and the reaction flask was left to reach room temperature. Afterwards the products were quickly separated by centrifugation. The obtained product was thoroughly washed with absolute ethanol before drying in a vacuum oven at 60 °C overnight. The dried powder was then placed in a ceramic boat and annealed at 500 °C in a tube furnace (3-zone, Nabertherm R 50/500/12) under an Ar flow (200 mL min−1) for 30 min (heating rate was 4 °C min−1). Before turning on the Ar flow, the tube was kept in vacuum till the temperature had reached 150 °C. After the furnace had been cooled, the product was removed from the tube furnace and aged in a humidity-controlled chamber (RH 55%) at room temperature (25 °C) for 20 days. The final product was stored in an Ar-filled glove box until further use for analysis and battery testing.
Materials characterization
Powder diffraction patterns for crystal structure and phase analysis were measured in Bragg–Brentano geometry using a Rigaku SmartLab Diffractometer (CuKα tube operated at 40 kV 40 mA, λ = 0.15409 nm). The chemical nature of products was confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) using a Kratos AXIS Supra spectrometer. The XPS data were processed using CasaXPS software and calibrated to C 1s (284.8 eV) peak. The morphology and fine structure of materials were studied using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) imaging. A JEOL 7001F microscope was used to acquire SEM images. A 200 kV JEOL 2100 TEM equipped with JEOL STEM detectors and an Oxford EDX detector (X-Max 80 mm2 silicon drift detector) was used to acquire HRTEM images, dark field scanning TEM (DF-STEM) images, energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) elemental maps and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns of colloidal samples drop-casted on 300 mesh Cu grids (lacey formvar coated). The SAED scale was calibrated according to a spattering gold standard using DiffTools.62 Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out by heating the sample in air at 5 °C min−1 from 25 °C to 800 °C using a NETZSCH STA 449 instrument (before TGA/DSC analysis, the CHVO sample was pre-heated at 140 °C under an Ar flow to remove much of the loosely bound water molecules). Renishaw inVia Raman microscope was used for Raman spectroscopy measurements. N2 adsorption/desorption measurements were recorded using a Micromeritics 3Flex instrument.
Electrochemical characterisation
Initially a 6 wt% PVDF solution was prepared by dissolving a measured amount of PVDF in NMP at 60 °C under magnetic stirring for 3 h. Then, active materials, carbon super P and PVDF were mixed at a weight ratio of 7:2:1. Additional NMP was added to obtain a thick slurry of the right consistency. Afterwards, the slurry was coated on a copper foil (wet thickness: 250 μm) using a doctor blade. The coating was allowed to dry for 12 h in a vacuum oven (60 °C). Once fully dried, the electrodes were cut to 15 mm disks. The material loading on the current collector was ∼1 mg cm−2. To evaluate the electrochemical properties of the materials, CR2032 type coin cells were assembled using Li metal (15 mm disk) as the counter electrode and 1 M LiPF6 as the electrolyte inside an Ar-filled high purity glove box (MBraun UniLab). Celgard 2400 membrane (19 mm) was used as the separator in coin cell batteries. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of batteries were investigated using a Gamry 1010E potentiostat. CV data was collected at varying scan rates (0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1 and 2 mV s−1) in the potential window of 0 to 3 V. A 1 MHz to 10 mHz frequency range and a sinusoidal amplitude of 5 mV were employed for EIS measurements. Galvanostatic (dis)charge of batteries was performed using Lanhe CT2001 electrochemical station in the potential range of 0.01 to 3.0 V. All potentials were recorded with respect to Li+/Li. To measure XRD and XPS of cycled electrodes, coin cells were disassembled inside the glove box at different dis(charge) cycles, and the electrodes were gently washed with diethyl carbonate prior to analysis. Specialized sample holders or transporters with an inert atmosphere were used to transfer cycled electrodes into analytical instruments. For instance, a dome sample holder enclosed by Kapton® window was used to acquire XRD data from cycled electrodes, using grazing incidence diffraction (GID) geometry at an incident X-ray angle of 1°. A Kratos air sensitive sample transporter was used to transfer cycled electrodes into the sample stage of the XPS machine.
Setting up in situ TEM experiments
A scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) type TEM holder (“Zues” by Zeptools, P. R. China) was used for the in situ electrical biasing experiments.39 The experiments were conducted inside a JEOL 2100 TEM. Firstly, a thin layer of the sample (CHVO) was coated on a piece of tracing paper, thereafter, the sample was attached to a gold wire (freshly cut and flattened at one end) by tapping once on the tracing paper. This gold wire was fixed to the immovable component of the specimen holder. The counter electrode was prepared by applying Li metal onto a fresh tungsten wire (by piercing a piece of lithium), which was fixed to the movable piezo-driven component of the specimen holder. The holder was quickly inserted into the specimen exchange chamber, within 5 s after applying Li. A thin layer of Li2O formed during TEM holder insertion time served as the solid electrolyte for a nanobattery.
