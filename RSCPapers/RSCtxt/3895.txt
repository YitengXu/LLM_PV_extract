    , Accepted 3rd September 2013First published on 3rd September 2013AbstractA dual excitation, dual emission phosphor has been fabricated by simultaneous doping of lanthanide ions Er3+, Yb3+, Eu3+ in a highly efficient host YVO4. YVO4 doped with Er3+, Yb3+, Eu3+ showed dual excitation i.e., simultaneously excitable by UV and IR radiation and dual emission i.e., bright red fluorescence under UV excitation and intense green under IR excitation. Red DC fluorescence arises due to 5D0–7FJ transitions of Eu3+. UC emission spectra indicate that Yb3+ not only sensitizes Er3+ to emit predominantly in the green but also Eu3+ to produce a signature red emission. A direct assembly of Ag nanoparticles (NPs) and YVO4:Er3+, Yb3+, Eu3+ on a suitable substrate showed enhancement of fluorescence of Eu3+ red emission under UV excitation. Such studies indicate that a two dimensional conformal transparent layer of a Ag NP–phosphor combined on a silicon solar cell may be used as a DC and UC solar spectrum converter from UV/IR to the visible region where the spectral response of Si is high.
1. Introduction
Luminescence phosphors are usually categorized as Stokes shifted down conversion (DC) and anti-Stokes shifted upconversion (UC) emitters. Rare earth lanthanide ions with specific energy level spacings and high radiative recombination rates are chosen as activators in phosphors amongst which Eu3+ is an excellent UV to red down shifter and Er3+ as IR to green/red up converter with Yb3+ as a sensitizer that resonantly absorbs IR radiation and efficiently transfers to emitter Er3+. DC and UC phosphors are prepared separately by choosing an appropriate host that can absorb UV efficiently and transfer energy to the activator ion (DC) or have low phonon energy for enhanced radiative recombination from Er3+ levels. UV excitable phosphors with very high luminescence efficiency have specific use in industries such as lighting and display. There are not too many efficient up conversion phosphors due to multiphoton absorption and single photon emission processes and mostly fluorides hosts are chosen due to their low phonon energy.1,2 A very important new application of phosphors is for enhancing solar energy conversion efficiency that requires conversion of hitherto unutilized solar UV and IR radiation, through appropriate phosphors, to visible region where spectral sensitivity of available solar cells are at a maximum. For such application, a single phosphor host doped with appropriate lanthanide activators that can perform the role of dual excitation and dual emission can prove to be ideal. Further, nanoparticles of such highly efficient lanthanide doped luminescent material can be used to make a thin transparent layer to be used with solar cells to improve efficiency through enhanced light input. Lanthanide doped inorganic nanophosphors have definite advantages over organic fluorescent dyes and quantum dots in terms of sharp and narrow emission, long decay time, low toxicity and negligible photo bleaching of f–f transitions of Ln3+ emitters. Such materials are also very useful for biological applications.
In this regard we have chosen YVO4 as the host material and rare earths, i.e. europium, erbium as light emitting activators and ytterbium as sensitizer. Individual down conversion (DC) and up conversion (UC) emission have been reported for YVO4:Eu3+ and YVO4:Er3+, Yb3+ respectively, but there is no report for both DC and UC dual mode luminescence from YVO4 doped with an identical set of lanthanide ions. YVO4 is an ideal UV sensitizer due to efficient host (VO43−) UV absorption and subsequent energy transfer to the rare earth activator ion with high luminescence efficiency.3,4 YVO4:Eu3+ has proved to be suitable for various applications such as white light emitting diodes (WLEDs), field emission display panels, in color television and cathode ray tubes (CRTs).5 Individual DC and UC emission have been reported for YVO4 doped with Eu, Sm etc.6,7 and Er, Yb.8 In the present study, YVO4 doped with Er3+, Yb3+, Eu3+ showed tunable dual excitation (simultaneously excitable by UV and IR radiation) and dual emission (under UV excitation bright red and under IR excitation intense green) phosphor characteristics. Both UV and IR mode excitation has been reported for NaGdF4:Tm, Yb/NaGdF4:Eu core–shell structure,9 in (Gd2O3:Er, Yb/Eu/DBM)3 Phen organic complex,10 in GdPO4:Yb3+, Tb3+,11 BaGd2(MoO4)4:Eu3+, Er3+, Yb3+.12 Dual emission has been achieved by using rare earth organic complexes, fluorescent dye systems13–16 but UV and IR were not used for their excitation. UC luminescence is usually observed in Yb3+ sensitized hosts such as NaYF4 and NaGdF4 with emitters Er3+, Tm3+, Ho3+.17–20 The IR resonant energy levels of Yb3+ efficiently absorb two IR photons and transfer energy to the ladder like energy levels of emitter ions Er3+/Tm3+/Ho3+. Due to a large energy gap between the Yb3+ levels (2F5/2) to Eu3+ emitting levels (5DJ), direct sensitization of Eu3+ ions for UC emission has less probability.
For clean solar photovoltaic power, efficiency enhancement of commercial solar cells is very important. As silicon solar cells can effectively absorb in the spectral range 550–1100 nm (hν ∼ Eg − 2Eg), most of the terrestrial solar energy (λ ∼ 300–2400 nm) in the UV and IR remains unutilized. Solar spectrum conversion by employing suitable phosphors to harness the unutilized part of the solar spectrum is a promising solution to reduce photon losses. The suitability of a phosphor system for solar spectrum modification depends on the excitation range of the phosphor system in the UV and IR. Also, the emission spectra under UV and IR excitation should cover the high spectral response region of the solar cell, the luminescence yield must be high and the phosphor system should be excitable by low light intensity. Both down conversion (DC) and up conversion (UC) phosphors can be used on the front and back faces of solar cells respectively to convert solar ultraviolet (UV) and transmitted infrared (IR) energy to the visible region for effective absorption. Use of both DC and UC phosphors needs a bifacial cell and technological difficulties in solar cell–phosphor layer integration poses a challenge as transmitted IR light is insignificant due to appreciable Si wafer thickness and fabricated electrodes on surfaces. Towards this goal, a dual excitation phosphor that can absorb both UV and IR solar radiation and emit in the visible region with high luminescence yield has been developed. In this regard, we have chosen the material system (YVO4:Er3+, Yb3+, Eu3+) as rare earth doped YVO4 phosphors have shown high luminescence yield.21,22 To further augment the luminescence yield, plasmonic enhancement of fluorescence has been accomplished by making a phosphor–Ag nanoparticle (NP) layer.
2. Experimental
2.1 Synthesis of phosphor
Yttrium oxide (Y2O3, 99.99%) and vanadium pentoxide (V2O5, CDH Analytical Reagent 99.5%) were used for the host and ytterbium oxide (Yb2O3, 99.99%, Aldrich), erbium oxide (Er2O3, 99.99%, Aldrich), Eu2O3 (99.95%, Aldrich) as activator precursors and nitric acid (Merck, 99.9%) ethanol (Merck), hydrochloric acid, and dichloromethane (Merck) were used without any further purification, for the synthesis of multi ion doped yttrium vanadate (YVO4). For synthesis by the solid state reaction (SSR) method, the starting materials Y2O3 (75 mol%), V2O5 (100 mol%), Er2O3 (2.0 mol%), Yb2O3 (18 mol%), Eu2O3 (5 mol%) were thoroughly mixed, packed in an alumina boat and fired at 1300 °C for 2 hours in an air atmosphere. The resultant product was ground with a mortar and pestle to obtain a fine powder. A YVO4:Er (2%), Yb (18%) sample was also prepared by an identical method to examine the difference in UC characteristics due to doping of Eu3+ ions. For the synthesis of nanoparticles of YVO4:Er3+, Yb3+, Eu3+, a co-precipitation (CPP) method was employed using the above mentioned precursors in the same stoichiometric proportions. Nitrate solutions of precursors were obtained by dissolving the oxides in the minimum amount of HNO3. NH4OH and H2O2 in the volume ratio 3:1 was added dropwise into the solution until the pH of the solution was 8 when ultrafine particles of YVO4 doped with rare earth started forming and were precipitated out in a centrifuge. The powder sample was washed repeatedly with DI water and then with ethanol to dehydrate the surface bound water molecules as OH− is a known quencher of luminescence. Finally the precipitates were dried in an oven at 40 °C for 12 h.
2.2 Synthesis of spherical silver nanoparticles
Silver nanoparticles were prepared by reducing AgNO3 by D-glucose, using PVA as capping agent. NaOH was used for maintaining high pH and for fast reduction of AgNO3, yielding monodispersed Ag NPs. UV-Vis absorption measurement of the Ag colloidal solution showed maximum absorptions at 400 nm and the color of the colloidal solution was straw yellow. No oxidation, confirmed by change in color was observed from the Ag colloidal solution over a few months from the date of synthesis.
2.3 Phosphor–Ag NP combination
The prepared colloidal solution of Ag NPs was directly mixed with YVO4:Er3+, Yb3+, Eu3+ (synthesized by SSR) dispersed in ethanol and both solutions were homogenized by thorough sonication. The homogenized composite solution of phosphor particles and Ag NPs was deposited as thin films on microscopic cover slips by spin coating. The prepared thin film was examined under a confocal fluorescence microscope. A thin film of only YVO4:Er3+, Yb3+, Eu3+ particles was also prepared in a similar way and examined under a confocal fluorescence microscope.
2.4 Material characterization
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern was recorded using a Rigaku MiniFlex Diffractometer with Cu-Kα radiation. The morphology of the developed nanoparticles was examined with transmission electron microscopy (TEM) model no. JEOL JEM-1011. The photoluminescence (PL) excitation, emission spectra and time resolved decay of luminescence were recorded using combined steady state fluorescence and a lifetime spectrometer of Edinburgh Instruments (FLSP920) with Xe lamp as excitation source for DC and IR (980 nm, 400 mW) for UC measurement. Decay measurements were performed using excitation of a microsecond pulsed Xe lamp and employing time correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) technique. Confocal fluorescence imaging was done using a WITec confocal Raman microscope (alpha300RS) with UV laser and IR laser (980 nm, 2 mW) for DC & UC measurements respectively.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Structure and morphology
The triple rare earth doped yttrium vanadate particles were synthesized by the SSR method at high temperature as well as nanoparticles by the CPP method at room temperature. XRD analysis was carried out for determining phase composition and the crystallite size of YVO4:Er3+, Yb3+, Eu3 particles. Fig. 1 shows the XRD pattern of YVO4:Er3+, Yb3+, Eu3 prepared by SSR (a) and CPP method (b) indicating monophasic zircon type orthovanadate tetragonal structure of pure YVO4 phase (JCPDS card 17-0341) without any precipitated phase. The average crystallite size was calculated based on Scherrer's relation. The increase in particle size from bulk to nano can be easily discerned by the change in peak width in the XRD patterns of samples prepared by the SSR and CPP method. The well-developed morphology of synthesized YVO4:Er3+, Yb3+, Eu3+ nanoparticles prepared by the co-precipitation method are shown in the TEM images (Fig. 2a and b) that showed hexagonal morphology with average particle size of 30–50 nm. The particles prepared by the SSR method exhibit well-formed rounded morphology (Fig. 2c and d) with average particle size about 1 μm. The thin film prepared by direct assembly of YVO4:Er3+, Yb3+, Eu3+ particles and Ag nanoparticles were examined by TEM and the micrograph showed a black portion corresponding to Ag NPs and transparent particles corresponding to YVO4 particles.

3.2 Up conversion luminescence
The UC PL emission spectra of YVO4:Er3+, Yb3+, Eu3+ and YVO4:Er3+, Yb3+ prepared by the SSR method are shown in Fig. 3(a), the background bright green spot is the photograph of the powder phosphor under IR (980 nm) illumination. To validate the comparison, the measurements were performed under identical experimental conditions and normalized against sample weight. The UC PL in the visible range for both Er3+, Yb3+, Eu3+ and Er3+, Yb3+ doped YVO4 powder phosphor under 980 nm diode laser excitation exhibit three distinct Er3+ emission bands in green (523–531 nm, 543–552 nm) and red (652–669 nm). The prominent green emission band between 543–552 nm has two peaks at 544 nm and 552 nm. The level space 4I15/2 → 4I11/2 of the Er3+ ion and 2F7/2 → 2F5/2 of the Yb3+ ion resonantly match the energy of the 980 nm laser photons, but due to a much higher excitation cross section and concentration of Yb3+ ions compared to Er3+ ions, the predominant IR excitation mechanism is through ground state excitation of two Yb3+ ions to the 2F5/2 level by absorption of two IR photons and energy transfer to Er3+ ions populating the 4I11/2 level (Fig. 6). Other Er3+ levels can be populated through energy transfer to the 4F7/2 level followed by multiphonon relaxation. Green emission at 523 nm is due to 4F7/2–4I15/2 and strong green peaks at 544 nm and at 552 nm are assigned to the 2H11/2 → 4I15/2 and 4S3/2 → 4I15/2 transitions respectively. Much smaller red emission was observed between 652–669 nm originating from the 4F9/2 → 4I15/2 to 4I11/2 → 4I15/2 transitions of Er3+. Due to addition of the Eu3+ dopant in YVO4:Er3+, Yb3+; there is significant enhancement of UC emission from the Er3+ related peaks and a set of new emission peaks related to Eu3+ transitions appeared under IR (980 nm) excitation. Such enhancement of Er3+ emission in triple activated Y2O3:Er, Yb, Eu has also been reported.21 A comparison of the UC PL emission spectra of YVO4:Er3+, Yb3+ and YVO4:Er3+, Yb3+, Eu3+ (Fig. 3a) synthesized by the SSR method clearly shows the additional UC emission peaks in triple activated YVO4:Er3+, Yb3+, Eu3+ in the red arising from Eu3+ at 593 nm (5D0–7F1), at 615–618 nm (5D0–7F2), 697–704 nm (5D0–7F4) and a small peak at 720 nm (5D0–7F6).

The backgrounds show the actual PL images of the developed phosphor under (a) IR and (b) UV excitation. 
The UC emission spectra from YVO4:Er3+, Yb3+, Eu3+ nanoparticles prepared by the CPP method (Fig. 4a) showed much weaker red emission from Er3+ (650–665 nm, 4F9/2–4I15/2) and Eu3+ UC emission at 615 nm (5D0–7F2) and a sharp intense peak at 720 nm (5D0–7F6). Since in NPs, Eu3+ may occupy surface sites without inversion symmetry, the 5D0–7F6 transition becomes prominent. Considerably less luminescence in NPs is due to inefficient incorporation of high concentration of activator (Er3+, Yb3+) ions in near room temperature synthesis.

(b) Time resolved PL decay at 300 nm excitation and 618 nm emission of YVO4:Er3+, Yb3+, Eu3+ nano and bulk phosphor, decay is much faster for nanoparticles; inset shows PL excitation spectra at 618 nm emission. 
3.3 Down conversion luminescence
The DC emission spectra of YVO4:Er3+, Yb3+, Eu3+ nano and bulk phosphor material is shown in Fig. 3(b). The fluorescence spectrum showed major peaks at 618 nm and 698 nm, when excited at 300 nm, arising due to 5D0–7F2 and 5D0–7F4 transitions of Eu3+ ions occupying Y3+ sites. The electric dipole transitions of Eu3+ (ΔJ = ±2, ±4) are hypersensitive to site symmetry and the effect can be seen with very intense 5D0–7F2 and 5D0–7F4 transitions. It was clearly indicated that under UV excitation, the same sample gives red color emission which confirms the down conversion of the UV wavelength to visible wavelength. The background bright orange red spot shows the actual photograph of YVO4:Er3+, Yb3+, Eu3+ (SSR) under UV excitation. The photoluminescence excitation (PLE) spectra of YVO4:Er3+, Yb3+, Eu3+ nanoparticles at 618 nm Eu3+ emission is shown as an inset in Fig. 4(b). The spectrum shows a broad band from 250 to 350 nm due to the charge transfer absorption of the VO43− in the host YVO4 and sensitizing the activator Eu3+ ion.23 The broad charge transfer band clearly shows the efficient host (YVO4) to activator (Eu3+) charge transfer process. The other sharp excitation peaks are due to direct f–f transitions of the Eu3+ ion e.g., the peak at 394 nm is due to direct excitation of Eu3+ levels 7F0–5L6. Dual excitation (UV and IR) and dual emission (green and red) of YVO4:Er3+, Yb3+, Eu3+ is thus clearly established.
3.4 Time resolved decay of luminescence
Time resolved luminescence decay of YVO4:Er3+, Yb3+, Eu3+ nano and bulk phosphor were measured to investigate the dynamics of photo physical processes related to bound excitons and their effect on particles with nanometer dimensions. The decay was recorded for the 5D0–7F2 transition at 618 nm emission under 300 nm excitation by a time correlated single photon counting technique using a microsecond pulsed xenon flash lamp as the source of excitation. The decay curves for YVO4:Er3+, Yb3+, Eu3+ powder samples prepared by SSR and CPP methods are shown in Fig. 4b. It can be clearly seen that decay becomes much faster for nanoparticles prepared by the CPP method compared to micron sized phosphor particles prepared by the SSR method. The decay curves of the YVO4:Er3+, Yb3+, Eu3+ prepared with the solid state reaction method have bi-exponential decay and the nanophosphor prepared with the co-precipitation method exhibited multi-exponential decay and the curves have been fitted to an exponential equation, the estimated decay parameters are listed in Table 1. Due to the large surface to volume ratio of NPs compared to micron sized particles, there would be surface states providing non-radiative pathways as well as some of the Eu3+ ions may be located on the surface sites without inversion symmetry leading to faster decay.

3.5 Plasmonic enhancement of fluorescence and confocal fluorescence measurements
The confocal UC fluorescence image and confocal UC fluorescence spectrum of YVO4:Er3+, Yb3+, Eu3+ particles under 980 nm (2 mW) laser excitation are shown in Fig. 5a(i) and a. The spectra clearly show the green emission from Er3+ as well as distinct sharp signature peaks from Eu3+ in the red region. Corresponding high resolution confocal UC fluorescence spectra from the Er3+ ion arising from transitions between Er3+ Stark split levels are clearly indicated in Fig. 5a(ii) and the inset shows the intense green UC emission of the powder sample under very low power (2 mW) 980 nm diode laser excitation.

The graph in Fig. 5b shows the fluorescence spectrum taken for YVO4:Er3+, Yb3+, Eu3+ and Ag NP composite thin films under UV laser excitation. The spectra shows the signature Eu3+ red emission due to UV excitation of YVO4:Er3+, Yb3+, Eu3+ and Ag NP combined. The optical (Fig. 5b(i)), confocal fluorescence image (Fig. 5b(ii)) and corresponding fluorescence spectra at the respective marked places as shown on Fig. 5b clearly indicate fluorescence enhancement at places where Ag NPs are present which is manifested by dark regions in the optical image and corresponding bright fluorescent confocal image.24 Enhancement of red emission up to 40 times has been observed under UV excitation. The UV-vis absorption spectra of Ag NPs reveal the maximum absorbance peak at 400 nm (Fig. 5b(iii)), which corresponds to the localized Surface Plasmon Resonance (LSPR) due to dipolar oscillation of spherical Ag nanoparticles. Because of the small size of Ag NPs, their presence is observed as a dark region in the optical image and due to enhancement of fluorescence from the phosphor in proximity to Ag NPs, the corresponding region in the confocal fluorescence image is bright. The graph clearly shows the increase in the fluorescence intensity in regions where Ag NPs are present in proximity to phosphor particles as can be seen by comparing the bright and dark regions in the optical image and corresponding dark and bright fluorescent confocal images with the fluorescence spectra recorded in different regions. This increase in fluorescence can be accredited to the plasmonic effect of silver nanoparticles which create a highly localized electric field around Ag NPs when illuminated by UV light. Phosphor particles in proximity to Ag NPs experience an enhanced excitation field due to LSPR and these highly localized fields are responsible for enhancement of the fluorescence emission from phosphors placed in the near-field of Ag NPs.25 Fluorescence enhancement in YVO4:Eu3+ phosphor in close proximity to Ag nanofilm has also been reported through enhancement of the electric dipole transitions of the Eu3+ ion.26
3.6 Mechanism of dual UC emission from Eu3+ and Er3+
The schematic diagram of dual mode excitation, energy transfer leading to UC and DC dual emission in a YVO4:Er3+, Yb3+, Eu3+ particle is shown in Fig. 6(a). Fig. 6(c) shows the proposed energy level diagram for DC and UC luminescence through energy transfer between the host and lanthanide dopants. For UV excitation (DC luminescence), the energy is absorbed by the host YVO4, mainly due to various intra- and intermolecular transitions of VO43−, followed by relaxation through phonons to the bottom of the excitation band from where the energy is transferred to neighboring Eu3+ ions to the 5DJ levels. Very efficient radiative transition from the lowest 5D0 excited level to lower 7FJ levels give rise to sharp emission peaks in the red spectral region (Fig. 3b). DC fluorescence enhancement happens through energy transfer from Ag NPs to Eu3+ levels and is indicated in the energy level diagram (Fig. 6c). UC excitation in Eu3+ occurs through cooperative energy transfer from two Yb3+ ions (Fig. 6c).
 Fig. 6  Schematic diagram of (a) dual mode excitation, energy transfer leading to UC and DC dual emission in a YVO4:Er3+, Yb3+, Eu3+ particle; (b) possible utilization of solar UV and IR radiation through spectral conversion by dual excitation dual emission YVO4:Er3+, Yb3+, Eu3+ phosphor; the green region denotes the solar spectral region that is utilized maximally by Si solar cells for photovoltaic conversion; (c) proposed energy level diagram for DC and UC luminescence, DC excitation and fluorescence enhancement through energy transfer from host (VO4) and Ag NPs to Eu3+ levels respectively is indicated. UC excitation in Eu3+ occurs through cooperative energy transfer from two Yb3+ ions. UC in the Er3+, Yb3+ system by GSA/ETU is also shown. 
For IR excitation at 980 nm and UC luminescence from Er3+, two photons are simultaneously resonantly absorbed by the 2F7/2 → 2F5/2 of the Yb3+ ion. One of the Yb3+ ions imparts the energy to the other Yb3+ ion that comes back to the ground 2F7/2 state. The excited Yb3+ ion successfully transfers the energy to various ladder-like levels of the Er3+ ion from where non-radiative relaxation and radiative transition (2H11/2 → 4I15/2 and 4S3/2 → 4I15/2) take place giving rise to predominant green emission. UC in the Er3+, Yb3+ system by ground state absorption (GSA)/energy transfer upconversion (ETU) is shown in Fig. 6c. UC emission corresponding to Er3+ ions increases with simultaneous doping of Eu3+ ion in YVO4. This is in contrast with the observation9 of NaGdF4:Tm, Yb, Eu where UC PL intensity decreases with Eu concentration due to unwanted cross relaxation between Tm and Eu ions. Characteristic emission peaks corresponding to 5D0–7FJ transitions of Eu3+ ions in the UC spectra of YVO4:Er3+, Yb3+, Eu3+, clearly indicate that energy transfer from the Yb3+ sensitizer to emitter Eu3+ takes place thus populating 5DJ levels of Eu3+ leading to red UC emission. The likely mechanism for UC emission from Eu3+ ions is cooperative energy transfer between a pair of Yb3+ ions and one Eu3+ ion as depicted in Fig. 6c. A pair of Yb3+ ions resonantly absorb two 980 nm photons to reach the 2F5/2 level and simultaneously transfer their energy to the emitter Eu3+ ion in the neighborhood to excite it to the 5DJ levels. Subsequent non-radiative relaxation to the lowest 5D0 level and radiative recombination to 7FJ levels produce red UC fluorescence which is clearly seen in the inset of Fig. 3a and the confocal fluorescence spectra (Fig. 5a). Such Yb3+ sensitized UC emission from Eu3+ and Tb3+ ions have been reported for Y2O3:Eu3+, Yb3+16 and GdPO4:Tb3+, Yb3+.11
The synthesized dual excitation phosphor YVO4:Er3+, Yb3+, Eu3+ has potential as a solar spectrum converter and Fig. 6(b) clearly shows how a single phosphor can harness the solar UV and IR regions by spectral conversion to the visible region for maximum photovoltaic utilization.
4. Conclusions
Monophasic YVO4 doped with three trivalent rare earth ions Er3+, Yb3+ and Eu3+ was prepared via a low temperature co-precipitation method with particle size ranging between 30–50 nm, and a high temperature solid state reaction method with average particle size about 1 μm. Y0.75%VO4:Er3+0.02%, Yb3+0.18%, Eu3+0.05% was the optimum concentration used. The developed material showed intense green upconversion fluorescence under low intensity IR (980 nm, 2 mW) excitation and bright orange red emission under UV (250–395 nm) excitation. A coupled system comprising Ag nanoparticles and YVO4:Er3+, Yb3+, Eu3+ phosphor particles embedded on a substrate showed an enhancement of red emission up to 40 times under UV excitation relative to only YVO4:Er3+, Yb3+, Eu3 phosphor. Enhancement of DC fluorescence from Eu3+ occurs due to excitation enhancement by the generated near field of Ag NPs and this was confirmed through confocal fluorescence imaging and spectroscopy.
The concept of producing dual excitation and dual emission through trivalent rare earth doped phosphor material for enhancing solar energy conversion i.e. using infrared (IR) and UV light for intense visible emission via up conversion and down conversion is introduced in this work. Such studies indicate that a single phosphor may be used as both DC and UC solar spectrum converter from the UV/IR to visible region where the spectral response of the solar cell is maximum. A two-dimensional conformal transparent layer of the Ag NP–phosphor combined on a silicon solar cell has potential to improve the performance of solar cells without altering the existing solar cell device structure. The dual excitation property can be used to harvest sunlight more efficiently as a single phosphor layer can convert both hitherto unutilized UV and IR light to visible radiation for efficient photovoltaics.
