    , Accepted 15th March 2019First published on 16th March 2019AbstractApplications of single-phase TiO2 and ZnO in the field of photoelectrochemical (PEC) solar hydrogen generation are limited by their high recombination rate of photogenerated charge carriers. Herein, a novel three-dimensional (3D) architecture comprising two-dimensional (2D) ZnO nanosheets (NSs) coated onto one-dimensional (1D) TiO2 nanowire arrays (NWAs) (ZnO/TiO2 2D/1D NSs-NWAs) is designed as an efficient photoelectrode for PEC solar hydrogen production. A type II band alignment established in the photoanode enables the electrons to be efficiently transported from ZnO NSs to TiO2 NWAs and the holes to be transferred from TiO2 NWAs to ZnO NSs, efficiently suppressing the recombination of electrons and holes. Additionally, the 3D architecture offers large areas for harvesting light energy, large interfacial contact areas with the electrolyte, and more pathways for rapid transfer and separation of charge carriers. The ZnO/TiO2 2D/1D NS-NWA photoanode exhibits remarkable enhancement for hydrogen generation in a neutral electrolyte solution. The H2 generation rate of the ZnO/TiO2 2D/1D NS-NWA photoanode is 3-fold that of the bare TiO2 NWA photoanode. Moreover, the ZnO/TiO2 2D/1D NS-NWA photoanode shows excellent photostability after irradiation with light for 5 h.
Introduction
Since water splitting to produce hydrogen (H2) by using a TiO2 electrode was reported for the first time,1 various semiconducting oxides have been widely studied for photoelectrochemical (PEC) solar water splitting to generate H2, because hydrogen energy is one of the most potential clean energy sources for the future.2–9 Among the studied metal oxide semiconductors, TiO2 is still one of the most promising photoelectrode materials for PEC solar water splitting to produce H2 due to its appropriate conduction band level, low cost and excellent physicochemical properties.5–20 Hence, many TiO2 nanostructures have been prepared and employed as photoanodes for PEC solar water splitting.5–20 It has been proven that one-dimensional (1D) nanowire arrays (NWAs) are ideal photoelectrode candidates for PEC water splitting to generate H2 since they offer improved charge transport and reduced charge carrier diffusion length as well as enhanced charge collection.18–22 Therefore, TiO2 NWAs have been intensively studied as photoanodes for PEC solar water splitting due to their unique structure feature and superior photocatalytic performance. However, the rapid recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes limits their practical applications. Thus how to efficiently separate the photoinduced charge carriers is a crucial issue to be solved for the design and preparation of TiO2 photoelectrodes with enhanced PEC solar water splitting for H2 generation.
As proven in many previous studies, heterogeneous photoelectrodes consisting of two semiconductors always achieve enhanced PEC water splitting activity because of their capability to effectively separate photogenerated electron–hole pairs.23 Thus many TiO2-based heterogeneous photoelectrodes have been designed and constructed through decorating or sensitizing other semiconductors. As an n-type wide band gap semiconductor, ZnO and ZnO-based nanostructures have shown potential applications in energy conversion,24 enzyme biosensing,25 PEC biosensing,26–28 and PEC water splitting.29–32 ZnO nanostructures have also been usually employed to modify TiO2 nanostructures to fabricate ZnO/TiO2 heterogeneous photoelectrodes for PEC water splitting. For example, TiO2/ZnO heterogeneous NWAs showed improved PEC water splitting activity compared with bare TiO2 NWAs.33 A heterogeneous photoanode constructed by decorating ZnO nanoshells on TiO2 nanotubes displayed enhanced PEC water splitting performance under visible light irradiation.34 These studies have demonstrated that the improved PEC performances of ZnO/TiO2 heterogeneous photoelectrodes are attributed to the efficient charge transport and separation induced by the type II band alignment.35–37
Besides constructing a suitable band structure with type II band alignment, another effective strategy for efficiently separating photogenerated charge carriers is to fabricate ZnO/TiO2 heterojunction nanostructures with high surface areas and large interfacial contact areas between the two semiconductors. The high surface areas of the photoelectrode enhance the utilization of light energy via improving light absorption. The high surface areas also provide large contact areas between the electrode and the electrolyte, which are favorable for enhancing the surface evolution kinetics and improving the PEC water splitting performance. Additionally, the large interfacial contact areas between the components of the photoelectrode are favorable for the rapid transport of charge carriers, resulting in their efficient separation and significant enhancement of the PEC water splitting activity.18,34,37–44 As mentioned above, NWAs can provide large surface areas to accommodate other nanostructures to form heterogeneous nanostructures with large contact areas.7,8,19,33–35,39 In addition, in contrast to NWAs, nanosheets (NSs) can provide much larger surface areas to harvest photon energy of solar light and much larger contact areas with the electrolyte, resulting in significant improvement of the PEC water splitting performance. Given the unique architecture of NSs coated onto NWAs, the three-dimensional (3D) heterojunction architecture consisting of NSs coated onto NWAs is a desirable photoelectrode for achieving efficient charge carrier separation and enhanced PEC water splitting activity.
In view of the superior photocatalytic performance and excellent physicochemical properties of TiO2 photocatalysts, and the advantages of heterogeneous photoelectrodes with large surface area and large interfacial contact area between the components as well as with the electrolyte, we have rationally designed for the first time a novel 3D ZnO/TiO2 heterojunction architecture consisting of two-dimensional (2D) ZnO NSs coated onto 1D TiO2 NWAs (ZnO/TiO2 2D/1D NSs-NWAs) as an efficient photoanode for H2 generation via PEC water splitting. The hierarchical 2D ZnO NSs were assembled onto 1D TiO2 NWAs by a facile seed-assisted hydrothermal strategy. Fig. 1 illustrates the fabrication process of the 3D novel ZnO/TiO2 2D/1D NSs-NWAs. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) studies show that the surfaces of 1D TiO2 NWAs are covered with hierarchical 2D ZnO NSs. The ZnO/TiO2 2D/1D NS-NWA heterojunction architecture is employed as a photoanode to evaluate its PEC solar water splitting performance for H2 generation. The incident photon conversion efficiency (IPCE) of the ZnO/TiO2 2D/1D NS-NWA photoanode is also studied. The correlations between the solar water splitting performances (electrode photocurrent, IPCE and H2 production) and densities of NSs are investigated. Spectroscopic measurements directly demonstrate that the type II band alignment is established in the heterojunction photoanode. This band alignment is favorable for the transfer of electrons from ZnO to TiO2. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements are carried out and provide an insight into the charge separation efficiency of ZnO/TiO2 2D/1D NSs-NWAs, showing that the enhanced PEC solar water splitting for H2 production and excellent photostability of ZnO/TiO2 2D/1D NSs-NWAs are ascribed to the improved charge separation.

Experimental section
Synthesis of 1D TiO2 NWAs
The 1D TiO2 NWAs were grown on a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrate by employing a modified hydrothermal method.45 A brief synthetic procedure was presented as follows: deionized water (15 mL) and concentrated hydrochloric acid (HCl, 36–38%, 15 mL) were mixed and then stirred for 10 min, followed by addition of 0.5 mL titanium(IV) butoxide. After vigorous stirring for 10 min, two pieces of cleaned FTO substrates with dimensions of 1.5 cm × 5 cm were placed against the wall of a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave (50 mL in volume). The conducting side of the FTO substrate was placed face-down in the solution. After that, the solution was slowly transferred into the autoclave and then heated at 150 °C for 3.5 h. The obtained sample was thoroughly washed with deionized water, dried and then annealed at 450 °C for 0.5 h in air.
Fabrication of 3D ZnO/TiO2 2D/1D NSs-NWAs
The 3D ZnO/TiO2 2D/1D NSs-NWAs were fabricated via an easy seed-assisted hydrothermal method. First, ZnO nanoparticle seeds were deposited onto the surfaces of 1D TiO2 nanowire arrays by the following process without any surface modification. Briefly, two droplets of 5 mM ethanolic solution of zinc acetate dihydrate were dropped onto the 1D TiO2 nanowire array film and then dried in air. After repeating this process two times, the 1D TiO2 nanowire array film loaded with zinc acetate was annealed at 300 °C for 20 min in air. Second, the 1D TiO2 nanowire array film loaded with ZnO nanoparticle seeds was placed against the wall of an autoclave (50 mL in volume) with the film side facing down, followed by addition of 20 mL zinc nitrate aqueous solution with appropriate concentrations (0.1 and 0.15 M), 20 mL of 0.1 M hexamethylenetetramine (HMT) aqueous solution and 3 mL of 50 mM trisodium citrate aqueous solution. Finally, the autoclave was heated at 95 °C for 1 h in an oven. After cooling down to room temperature naturally, the collected ZnO/TiO2 2D/1D NS-NWA samples were washed with deionized water five times and then dried in air. The samples prepared with zinc nitrate concentrations of 0.1 and 0.15 M are referred to as ZnO/TiO2 NSs-NWAs-0.1 and ZnO/TiO2 NSs-NWAs-0.15, respectively.
Characterization
X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) patterns of the prepared samples were obtained to analyze their composition. The surface chemical composition and elemental electronic states of the prepared samples were analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, ESCALAB 250Xi). The binding energy of C 1s at 284.8 eV was employed as a reference for the calibration of binding energies. The size and morphology of the samples were evaluated by using scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Hitachi S-4800). UV-visible spectra were measured on a spectrophotometer (Lambda 950, Perkin-Elmer).
PEC measurements
The PEC measurements of the photoelectrodes were performed on an electrochemical setup with a three-electrode PEC cell. The fabricated sample (pure 1D TiO2 NWAs or ZnO/TiO2 2D/1D NSs-NWAs) was employed as the working electrode, and Ag/AgCl and a Pt plate were used as reference and counter electrodes, respectively. 200 mL of Na2SO4 aqueous solution (0.1 M, neutral solution) was employed as the electrolyte. A 300 W xenon lamp equipped with an AM 1.5G filter was employed to provide light. The power intensity of the light on the sample surface was ∼100 mW cm−2. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) measurements were performed with a sweep rate of 5 mV s−1. IPCE measurements were conducted under the irradiation of monochromatic light provided using a monochromator (Newport CS260). EIS was carried out at the open circuit-potential in the frequency range from 1 to 100000 Hz. The measurements for H2 generation and photostability were performed in 0.1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte solution. A displacement method was employed to collect H2.46 Prior to the start of each PEC measurement, the electrolyte was degassed by using N2 gas for 20 min. The same electrochemical setup as that employed for the measurements of photocurrent density was used for the measurements of the IPCE, EIS, H2 generation, and photostability. The external bias potentials used in this work are versus the reference electrode (Ag/AgCl).
Results and discussion
The XRD patterns of the as-prepared samples are shown in Fig. 2. Before modification with ZnO nanostructures, the XRD pattern displays that the sample is composed of TiO2 crystals with a rutile phase structure (JCPDS: No.77-0440). After modification with ZnO nanostructures, the main diffraction peaks also originate from the rutile phase TiO2 crystals. However, the diffraction peak intensity of FTO at about 34.0° is obviously enhanced. The enhancement of this diffraction peak intensity results from the appearance of the diffraction peak of the (002) planes of ZnO crystals with a hexagonal wurtzite structure (JCPDS: No. 79-0207). Thus the XRD results show that the ZnO/TiO2 heterojunction structures are successfully synthesized via the present method.

XPS spectra are obtained to study the surface chemical composition of the prepared products. The survey spectrum displayed in Fig. 3a shows the binding-energy peaks of Zn, Ti, and O elements in the sample, indicating that ZnO/TiO2 heterojunction architectures are successfully prepared via an easy and novel seed-assisted hydrothermal method. Fig. 3b exhibits the core-level XPS spectrum of Ti 2p. The two peaks at 464.1 and 458.4 eV are from Ti 2p1/2 and Ti 2p3/2, respectively. The energy separation of 5.7 eV between the binding energies further confirms that the binding energies originate from the Ti 2p1/2 and Ti 2p3/2 bands of rutile TiO2.47Fig. 3c shows the fine scan XPS spectrum of Zn 2p. The binding energies of 1044.5 and 1021.5 eV can be indexed to the Zn 2p1/2 and Zn 2p3/2 bands of the ZnO, respectively. The energy separation between the two binding energies is 23 eV, which is consistent with the previously reported value for Zn 2p bands in ZnO crystals.48,49 The XPS spectrum of O 1s of the prepared TiO2/ZnO heterojunction architecture shows two peaks as presented in Fig. 3d. The peak at 529.8 eV comes from the oxygen species of TiO2 and ZnO, whereas the peak centered at 532.3 eV may originate from the chemisorbed water or oxygen species on the surface of the sample.50

Fig. 4a shows the SEM images of the 1D TiO2 NWAs grown on the FTO substrate, demonstrating that the 1D TiO2 NWAs with a tetragonal prism cross section are successfully grown on the whole FTO substrate. After growing ZnO nanoparticle seeds, it can be easily found in Fig. 4b that many ZnO nanoparticles (NPs) have been successfully deposited onto the surfaces of the TiO2 NWAs. The SEM images of 3D ZnO/TiO2 2D/1D NS-NWA architectures prepared with different zinc nitrate concentrations are exhibited in Fig. 4c and f, showing that hierarchical 2D ZnO NSs grow onto the entire surface and top of 1D TiO2 NWAs. Fig. 4c and d show the SEM images of 3D ZnO/TiO2 2D/1D NS-NWA architectures synthesized by using 0.1 M zinc nitrate as the Zn source. The images show that the tops of 1D TiO2 NWAs are covered with hierarchical 2D ZnO NSs, but some tops of 1D TiO2 NWAs are also observed. A higher concentration (0.15 M) of zinc nitrate results in the growth of hierarchical 2D ZnO NSs on the entire top of 1D TiO2 NWAs as exhibited in Fig. 4e and f. Moreover, the 2D ZnO NSs form 3D hierarchical architectures and grow on the entire area of 1D TiO2 NWAs.

(e) and (f) Low- and medium-magnification SEM images of 3D ZnO/TiO2 2D/1D NS-NWA architectures fabricated in 0.15 M zinc nitrate aqueous solution. 
The high-magnification SEM images of 3D ZnO/TiO2 2D/1D NSs-NWAs synthesized with different zinc nitrate concentrations were further used to study the morphological structure of the ZnO nanostructures (Fig. S1†). Using 0.1 M zinc nitrate, although networks of hierarchical 2D ZnO NSs almost grow on the entire top of 1D TiO2 NWAs, some tops of 1D TiO2 NWAs are still observed as presented in Fig. S1a and b.† In addition, it can be found that the networks are constructed with hierarchical NSs. With increasing zinc nitrate concentration to 0.15 M, hierarchical 2D ZnO NSs grow on the entire top of the 1D TiO2 NWAs (Fig. S1c and d†), and the entire top of 1D TiO2 NWAs is completely covered with hierarchical 2D ZnO NSs. It is worth noting that these 2D ZnO NSs assemble into 3D hierarchical architectures (Fig. S1d†). The 3D hierarchical architectures assembled with the NSs provide large surface areas and large contact areas with the electrolyte, which are favorable for enhancing the light harvesting and surface evolution kinetics of the 3D ZnO/TiO2 2D/1D NS-NWA photoanode.
In the present reaction system, the formation process of ZnO NSs is as follows: (1) during the heating reaction process, hexamethylenetetramine is thermally decomposed to slowly release OH− ions; (2) the Zn2+ ions of zinc nitrate solution react with the OH− ions to form ZnO crystal nuclei; (3) the ZnO seed serves as the nucleation center to enable ZnO crystal nuclei to grow onto the surface of TiO2 NWAs; (4) the citrate ions adsorb onto the positively charged Zn2+-terminated (0001) polar plane via coulombic force51 to significantly slow down the growth along the [0001] direction of ZnO crystals, resulting in the formation of NPs from the crystal nuclei, and (5) the ZnO NPs finally grow into NSs through an oriented attachment sideway growth process.51
The 3D ZnO/TiO2 2D/1D NS-NWA architectures fabricated with different zinc nitrate concentrations were employed as photoelectrodes to estimate their PEC solar water splitting performances in a neutral Na2SO4 electrolyte solution. Fig. 5a and b show the transient photocurrents for the bare 1D TiO2 NWA and 3D ZnO/TiO2 2D/1D NS-NWA photoanodes in 0.1 M Na2SO4 solution at 0 and 0.8 V versus Ag/AgCl, respectively. After the growth of hierarchical ZnO NSs, the photocurrent density of the photoanodes increases significantly compared to that of the pure TiO2 NWA photoanode. In addition, the higher concentration of zinc nitrate results in the formation of 3D hierarchical architectures assembled with 2D ZnO NSs (see the SEM images in Fig. 4e and f and Fig. S1c and d†), enabling the photoanode to obtain higher photocurrent density due to its improved light harvesting ability and enhanced surface evolution kinetics resulted from the large surface areas and large contact areas between the photoanode and electrolyte. At an applied voltage of 0.8 V versus Ag/AgCl, the ZnO/TiO2 NSs-NWAs-0.15 photoanode achieves a photocurrent density of 1.45 mA cm−2, which is about 3-fold that of pure TiO2 NWAs as presented in Fig. 5b.
 Fig. 5  (a) and (b) Photocurrent densities of the photoanodes at 0 and 0.8 V versus Ag/AgCl under simulated solar light irradiation (black line: TiO2 NWA photoanode, red line: ZnO/TiO2 NSs-NWAs-0.1 photoanode, blue line: ZnO/TiO2 NSs-NWAs-0.15 photoanode). (c) The curves of photocurrent densities versus applied bias of the photoanodes under simulated solar light irradiation. (d) IPCE plots of the photoanodes at 0.8 V versus Ag/AgCl. 

Fig. 5c exhibits the LSV plots of the pristine 1D TiO2 NWA and 3D ZnO/TiO2 2D/1D NS-NWA photoanodes in 0.1 M Na2SO4 solution under simulated solar light irradiation. The measurements clearly show that the photocurrent densities of the 1D TiO2 NWA and 3D ZnO/TiO2 2D/1D NS-NWA photoanodes increase with the applied potential. However, the 3D ZnO/TiO2 2D/1D NS-NWA photoanodes show remarkably enhanced photocurrent densities compared with the bare 1D TiO2 NWA photoanode. To further estimate the PEC solar water splitting ability of the fabricated 3D ZnO/TiO2 2D/1D NS-NWA photoanodes, the IPCE values of the bare 1D TiO2 NWA and 3D ZnO/TiO2 2D/1D NS-NWA photoanodes were measured at 0.8 V versus Ag/AgCl. Fig. 5d shows the IPCE plots of the bare 1D TiO2 NWA and 3D ZnO/TiO2 2D/1D NS-NWA photoanodes. It can be found that the bare 1D TiO2 NWA photoanode shows poor IPCE with an efficiency of less than 5% from 330 to 400 nm. However, the 3D ZnO/TiO2 2D/1D NS-NWA photoanodes exhibit significantly enhanced IPCE values from 330 to 400 nm. Particularly, the 3D ZnO/TiO2 NSs-NWAs-0.15 photoanode exhibits significantly improved IPCE with a maximum value of 80% at 390 nm.
The water splitting abilities to generate H2 of the as-fabricated 1D TiO2 NWA and 3D ZnO/TiO2 2D/1D NS-NWA photoanodes were evaluated in 0.1 M Na2SO4 solution at 0.8 V versus Ag/AgCl under illumination by simulated solar light. The yields of H2 exhibit a linear increase with the irradiation time as displayed in Fig. 6a, showing the outstanding photochemical stability of the prepared 1D TiO2 NWA and 3D ZnO/TiO2 2D/1D NS-NWA photoanodes. Fig. 6b exhibits the average H2 generation rates for the bare 1D TiO2 NWA and 3D ZnO/TiO2 2D/1D NS-NWA photoanodes under light illumination for 5 h, showing that the pure 1D TiO2 NWA photoanode displays a low H2 generation rate. The 3D ZnO/TiO2 NSs-NWAs-0.15 photoanode exhibits the highest H2 production rate and achieves a generation rate of 26 μmol h−1, which is 3-fold that of the pristine 1D TiO2 NWA photoanode. Additionally, it can be found that the yields of H2 generation exhibit a linear increase with the irradiation time (Fig. 6a), showing the excellent photostability of the synthesized 3D ZnO/TiO2 2D/1D NS-NWA photoanodes. The enhanced yields of H2 reveal the critical role of the hierarchical ZnO NSs in enhancing the PEC solar water splitting performance of the 3D ZnO/TiO2 2D/1D NS-NWA photoanodes.

The photostability of photoelectrodes under light irradiation for a long time is very important for practical application in water splitting into H2. The photostability of photoelectrodes can be appraised by evaluating the stability of the photocurrent under continuous light illumination for a long time. Fig. 6c shows the photocurrent densities of the pure 1D TiO2 NWA and 3D ZnO/TiO2 2D/1D NS-NWA photoanodes under simulated solar light irradiation for 5 h at 0.8 V versus Ag/AgCl. The time-dependent photocurrents demonstrate that the fabricated 3D ZnO/TiO2 2D/1D NS-NWA photoanodes exhibit excellent photostability under light irradiation for a long time. Particularly, the 3D ZnO/TiO2 NSs-NWAs-0.15 photoanode maintains a stable photocurrent of greater than 1.4 mA cm−2 after continuous light irradiation for 5 h. The remarkably improved PEC water splitting ability to generate H2 and the outstanding stability of 3D ZnO/TiO2 2D/1D NS-NWA photoanodes are ascribed to the efficient transfer and separation of photoinduced electrons and holes.
To elucidate the transfer and separation process of photoinduced charge carriers, the relative positions of energy bands for TiO2 and ZnO in the ZnO/TiO2 2D/1D NS-NWA heterojunction structure are evaluated via combining the valence band (VB) XPS spectra of pure 1D TiO2 NWAs and 2D ZnO NSs with the core-level XPS spectra of the heterojunction structure. Fig. 7a and b show the VB XPS spectra of pure 1D TiO2 NWAs and 2D ZnO NSs, showing that the valence band maximum (VBM) values for 1D TiO2 NWAs and 2D ZnO NSs are 2.43 and 2.87 eV, respectively. The core-level XPS spectra show that the binding energies of Ti 2p3/2 and Zn 2p3/2 for pure 1D TiO2 NWAs and 2D ZnO NSs are 458.3 and 1021.9 eV (Fig. S2†)), respectively, whereas the core-level band energies of Ti 2p3/2 and Zn 2p3/2 for the ZnO/TiO2 2D/1D NS-NWA heterojunction structure are 458.4 and 1021.5 eV (Fig. 3b and c), respectively. Additionally, the UV-vis light absorption spectra demonstrate that the band gaps of 1D TiO2 NWAs and 2D ZnO NSs are 3.06 and 3.14 eV (Fig. S3†)), respectively. These spectroscopic measurements provide experimental data to determine the VB (ΔEV) and the conduction band (CB) (ΔEC) offsets between ZnO and TiO2 in the ZnO/TiO2 2D/1D NS-NWA heterojunction structure via the following equations:52 ΔEV(ZnO/TiO2) = (EZn2p3/2 − EVBM)ZnO − (ETi2p3/2 − EVBM)TiO2 − ΔECL(1) ΔECL = (EZnO2p3/2 − ETi2p3/2)ZnO/TiO2(2) ΔEC = (Egap)ZnO − (Egap)TiO2 + ΔEV(ZnO/TiO2)(3)

According to the above equations and XPS experimental results, the value of ΔEV is 0.06 eV, and the value of ΔEC is 0.14 eV. Thus the spectroscopic measurements show the formation of the type II band alignment in the ZnO/TiO2 NS-NWA heterojunction structure as presented in Fig. 7c.
It has been demonstrated that the type II band alignment promotes charge carrier transport and separation in a heterojunction structure. In the present 3D ZnO/TiO2 2D/1D NS-NWA heterojunction structure, the type II band alignment enables the photogenerated electrons to transport from the CB of ZnO to that of TiO2 and the holes to transfer from the VB of TiO2 to that of ZnO, resulting in the efficient separation of the photoinduced electron–hole pairs. The efficient separation of electron–hole pairs significantly improves the PEC solar water splitting activity of the 3D ZnO/TiO2 2D/1D NS-NWA heterojunction structures, which is experimentally confirmed by our measurements as demonstrated in Fig. 5 and 6.
The EIS measurements provide an insight into the charge separation efficiency for the ZnO/TiO2 2D/1D NS-NWA photoanodes. Fig. 7d exhibits the EIS spectra of the prepared 3D ZnO/TiO2 NS-NWA photoanodes. As shown in the semicircular Nyquist curves, the 3D ZnO/TiO2 2D/1D NS-NWA photoanodes exhibit smaller arc radii compared with the pure TiO2 NWA photoanode. The smaller arc radii demonstrate that the 3D ZnO/TiO2 2D/1D NS-NWA photoanodes exhibit fast charge transfer and efficient charge separation.53–55 Thus the results of the EIS measurements show that the 3D ZnO/TiO2 2D/1D NS-NWA photoanodes exhibit improved interfacial charge transfer and separation, resulting in significant enhancement of photocurrent density, IPCE and PEC solar water splitting for H2 generation. Additionally, the excellent photostability of the 3D ZnO/TiO2 2D/1D NS-NWA photoanodes is also attributed to the efficient transfer and separation of photogenerated charge carriers.
Conclusions
A hierarchical 3D ZnO/TiO2 2D/1D NS-NWA heterojunction architecture is rationally designed and successfully fabricated by using a facile seed-assisted hydrothermal method to coat 2D ZnO NSs onto 1D TiO2 NWAs. Used as a photoanode, the fabricated novel 3D ZnO/TiO2 2D/1D NS-NWA heterojunction architecture exhibits remarkable enhancement of photocurrent density, IPCE and PEC water splitting for H2 generation in a neutral electrolyte solution under simulated solar light illumination. The H2 generation rate of the novel 3D ZnO/TiO2 2D/1D NS-NWA photoanode is 3-fold that of the bare TiO2 NWA photoanode. Additionally, the 3D ZnO/TiO2 2D/1D NS-NWA photoanode also displays outstanding stability and maintains a stable photocurrent of more than 1.4 mA cm−2 under continuous light irradiation for 5 h. The detailed studies for the PEC water splitting performances of the 3D ZnO/TiO2 2D/1D NS-NWA photoanodes and the investigations of the band alignment of the ZnO/TiO2 heterojunction structure reveal that the enhanced PEC water splitting activities and excellent photostability are ascribed to the following contributions: (1) the large surface areas of hierarchical 2D ZnO NSs improve the light absorption ability, (2) the hierarchical 2D ZnO NSs provide large contact area with the electrolyte and then enhance the surface evolution kinetics of the photoanode, and (3) the type II band alignment in the heterojunction structure facilitates the transport and separation of photogenerated electrons and holes. This study offers very useful insights into the rational design and construction of novel 3D NS-NWA photoelectrodes for highly efficient solar fuel generation.
