    , Accepted 20th January 2023First published on 8th February 2023AbstractElectrooxidation reactions of organic molecules that require a much lower overpotential are currently considered as promising alternatives to replace the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in water electrolysis. Herein, an ultrafast oxygen plasma treatment is implemented to modify commercial cobalt–nickel foam (CNF) to regulate the high-valence Co3+ and Ni3+, rendering more active sites, faster reaction kinetics and enhanced response towards glucose. Compared to the OER, the overpotential of the plasma-treated CNF at 10 mA cm−2 was reduced to 133 mV via glucose electro-oxidation coupled with water splitting.
Hydrogen, with an ultrahigh energy density, is an ideal and green energy carrier to be widely used in the near future. Compared to the conventional fuel reforming-related hydrogen production techniques, alkaline electrocatalytic water splitting offers a sustainable and promising route to achieving hydrogen production on an industrial scale.1 Since the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is kinetically sluggish and limits the overall efficiency, the relevant research studies have mainly focused on developing high-performance OER catalysts over the last decade.2 Recently, the oxidation of organic molecules, which is thermodynamically and kinetically favorable, not only reduces the energy consumption for hydrogen production, but the synthesis of value-added chemicals at the anode is also achieved simultaneously.3,4 For example, glucose, a biomass-derived compound, was used as an anodic auxiliary reagent to accelerate the hydrogen evolution.5–7 In this regard, coupling anode-replacing reactions with hydrogen production is a unique route to advancing water splitting and energy-conversion applications.8
It should be noted that the electrocatalyst and membrane are the most critical components in water electrolyzers. Among the electrocatalysts reported, cobalt–nickel (Co–Ni)-based materials with a low cost and attractive electrocatalytic activity have emerged as promising OER catalysts in the past decade.9 However, the complicated and time-consuming processes usually involved in the current synthetic methods are not applicable for efficient and large-scale production of these electrocatalysts. For example, the electrocatalyst powders prepared via wet-chemical routes (such as hydrothermal, sol–gel, etc.) might be subsequently post-annealed to generate defects or tune the metal valence states. In addition, powder materials need to be pasted onto the current collectors using Nafion solution as a binder, which inevitably leads to a relatively higher charge transfer resistance (Rct) due to its electrical-insulating characteristics.10 In contrast, a lot of effort has been devoted to surface modification of electrocatalysts; for example, plasma technology is often employed to directly functionalize the materials and change the surface properties without damaging the material structure.11,12 Compared to other modification strategies, plasma treatment is the most straightforward one to achieve chemical grafting, ion implantation, functional group modification and wettability enhancement within a several nanometer region of the surface, where the electrocatalytic reactions take place. In particular, the microstructure and electrocatalytic performance are often governed by the atmosphere during the plasma treatment process. In comparison to Ar or H2 plasma, O2 plasma can increase the surface roughness of the metal foils and improve the wettability and infiltration.13,14 More importantly, the energetic oxidizing ability also increases the amount of high-valence transition metal species, which are recognized as the active species for water oxidation.11,15
Herein, taking Co–Ni foam (CNF) as a model electrocatalyst, we report an ultrafast O2 plasma treatment (within 5 min) towards surface-controlled CNF for glucose oxidation-assisted water electrolysis. Since the electrocatalytic reactions usually occur at the electrocatalysts’ surface and the high-valence metal species are mainly responsible for the electrooxidation reaction,16,17 the O2 plasma treatment endows the CNF with abundant Co3+, a superhydrophilic surface, an enlarged electrochemical surface area, a strong response towards glucose molecules and fast charge transport kinetics, thereby enhancing the electrocatalytic performance of glucose electro-oxidation coupled with hydrogen production.

Fig. 1a schematically shows the effect of O2 plasma treatment on CNF. During the plasma charging process, the surface metallic cobalt and nickel atoms can quickly react with the highly energetic oxygen species, resulting in an increased number of oxidized Co3+ and Ni3+.18 In the XRD patterns, the main diffraction peaks of pristine CNF are assigned to metallic cobalt and nickel. After O2 plasma treatment with different powers, no new phase is detected, probably due to the amorphous characteristics of the surface etched part (Fig. S1, ESI†). In the SEM images, there is no distinct change in the surface microstructure of the treated CNFs (Fig. S2, ESI†). To better reveal the effect of plasma treatment on the surface morphology, CNF electrodes before and after plasma treatment were subjected to XPS characterizations. As shown in the high-resolution Co 2p spectra (Fig. 1b), three fitted subpeaks are located at 779.9, 781.7 and 786.0 eV, corresponding to Co3+, Co2+ and a satellite peak.19 The absence of zero-valence metal signals is due to the rapid surface oxidation during the specimen storage. Notably, the peak area ratio of Co3+/Co2+ increases from 0.74 for pristine CNF to 1.39 for CNF-60 (Fig. 1c), indicative of the promoting effect of O2 plasma treatment on regulating the metal valence, which is also supported by the distinct Ni3+ signal peak in the Ni 2p spectrum of CNF-60 (Fig. 1d, the peak area ratios of Ni3+/Ni2+ are 1.28 for CNF and 3.03 for CNF-60).20

Next, we turn to evaluating the plasma treatment effect on the electrocatalytic performance of CNF electrodes. It is obvious that the LSV curves (Fig. 2a) show a negative shift after plasma treatment, rendering a smaller overpotential of 332 mV (at 10 mA cm−2) compared to that of the pristine CNF (376 mV). The corresponding Tafel slope significantly decreases from 83.0 mV dec−1 for pristine CNF to 67.7 mV dec−1 for CNF-60 (Fig. 2b). Note that the purchased electrode is directly treated in a very short time (5 min) without any other complicated procedure, the improved OER activity is still comparable to the previously reported materials (Table S1, ESI†). In the meantime, the OER driven by CNF-60 can stably last for 12 h with a very slight potential fluctuation (Fig. S4, ESI†). Apart from the OER, the plasma-modified CNF electrodes are also more active towards the HER (Fig. S5, ESI†). In addition, the EIS spectra of CNF electrodes before and after O2 plasma treatment were collected at 1.6 VRHE and −0.35 VRHE to study the charge transfer behavior during the OER and HER processes, respectively. As shown in the Nyquist plots (Fig. 2c and Fig. S6, ESI†), CNF-60 has a lower charge Rct as exemplified by a smaller semicircle arc, revealing that O2 plasma treatment can effectively accelerate the charge transfer kinetics, which is more distinct in the OER test (Fig. 2a).

(f) Plots of current density versus scan rates for bare CNF and CNF-60. Electrolyte: 1 M KOH. 
Given that the O2 plasma cleaning is commonly recognized as a surface treatment technique and the rapid modification is only involved within tens of nanometers of the material surface,21 the enhanced electrocatalytic activity is likely associated with the surface modification of the CNF electrodes. Thus, we first performed water contact angle measurements. Both the CNF and CNF-60 electrodes show superhydrophilic features regardless of plasma treatment, as supported by a very quick infiltration of water droplets (Fig. S7, ESI†). This indicates that the activity enhancement should be attributed to the elemental modifications instead of the surface wettability. Second, the recorded CV curves of CNF and CNF-60 show three regions (Fig. 2d): (i) OH− adsorption at the non-faradaic potentials, (ii) redox reaction of metal ions, and (iii) OER at higher potentials. The integral area of CNF-60 is 1.4 times higher than that of pristine CNF (Fig. 2e), implying abundant active sites generated via the O2 plasma treatment.22,23 Third, the CV curves at the non-faradaic potential window are collected to determine the Cdl, which can be used to reflect the ECSA (Fig. S8, ESI†).24 In comparison to the pristine CNF (4.08 mF cm−2), a much larger Cdl of CNF-60 (7.58 mF cm−2) is indicative of the increased number of active sites (Fig. 2f). It is well accepted that the commonly used geometric area-normalized current density (jgeo) cannot thoroughly reflect the intrinsic electrocatalytic activity and the effect of ECSA should be taken into consideration.25 After ECSA normalization, CNF-60 is still more electrochemically active than the pristine CNF (Fig. S9, ESI†). Overall, combining the above electrochemical results and wettability tests, it is deduced that the O2 plasma treatment can effectively endow the CNF with fast reaction kinetics and charge transfer rate and more active sites.
Now we evaluate the promoting effect of glucose electro-oxidation on hydrogen production. First, electrochemical characterizations were conducted to better reveal the electrodes’ responses toward glucose molecules. In general, the changes of open-circuit potential (OCP) when injecting small molecules into the electrolyte can reflect the responses of the electrocatalyst towards the added molecules.26 Thus, the OCP values before and after injecting glucose solution were recorded, aiming to evaluate the sensitivity of pristine and plasma-treated CNF electrodes. As seen in the OCP plots, the plasma-treated CNF is more sensitive to glucose as the change in OCP for CNF-60 is more distinct than that of bare CNF when injecting 0.15 M glucose (Fig. 3a). Such a potential change when reaching the electrode potential equilibrium is related to the adsorbates in the Helmholtz layer,27,28 reflecting an enhanced adsorption of glucose. Then, the Nyquist plots and Bode plots of CNF-60 were recorded at 1.6 VRHE in KOH with or without glucose (Fig. 3b and c). After fitting with the equivalent circuit model (Fig. S10 and Table S2, ESI†), CNF-60 shows a much smaller charge transfer resistance (Rct) in KOH + glucose solution (4.07 Ω) than that in KOH electrolyte (20.58 Ω). Also, the decreased phase angle indicates that more electrons are involved in the oxidation reaction to achieve a rapid oxidation of glucose (Fig. 3d).29,30 Since the glucose oxidation and OER both take place at 1.6 VRHE, the EIS results can reflect the assistance effect of glucose oxidation on the charge transfer kinetics. Afterwards, the LSV curves of CNF-60 were collected with the presence of glucose. It is clearly seen that the LSV curves negatively shift and the overpotential at 10 mA cm−2 significantly decreases from 332 mV to 133 mV when increasing the glucose concentration up to 0.15 M (Fig. 3e and f), which is probably attributed to the enhanced surface response to glucose by O2 plasma treatment. To confirm this, the NPV data were plotted by recording the steady-state current density at different potentials. At lower potentials (1.25–1.4 VRHE), the current densities of both CNF and CNF-60 show a very slight change since the glucose oxidation is not distinct. When the potential exceeds above 1.45 VRHE, the current density of CNF-60 is higher than that of pristine CNF, suggesting the better mass transfer of glucose upon CNF-60, thereby promoting the water electrolysis (Fig. 3g). Another critical parameter is the durability that is revealed by the chronoamperometry test at 10 mA cm−2. Compared to pristine CNF, the potential of CNF-60 is more stable within 12 h, indicating a good long-term stability of glucose oxidation-assisted hydrogen production (Fig. 3h). It is seen that the dominant high-valence Co3+ is a result of the MOOH species formed during the anode oxidation reaction (Fig. S11, ESI†). In addition, to reveal the oxidation product at the anode, the residual electrolyte was collected and analysed by liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC–MS). Combining the extracted ion chromatogram and the mass spectrum (Fig. S12, ESI†) together, it is deduced that the oxidation product is glucaric acid (Table S3, ESI†).

(h) Chronopotentiometry tests of bare CNF and CNF-60 in 1 M KOH + 0.15 M glucose without iR compensation. 
Finally, the overall electrolysis performance was evaluated via a two-electrode system in a H-type cell. Fig. 4a schematically illustrates the test batch, in which the H2 bubbles occur on the cathode and no bubbles are seen on the anode. The required overpotential of CNF-60//CNF-60 to afford a current density of 10 mA cm−2 shows a shift of 269 mV compared to that of paired bare CNFs (Fig. 4b). The feasibility for practical applications is confirmed by testing the long-term glucose-assisted hydrogen production at varied current densities from 10 to even 100 mA cm−2 (Fig. 4c), of which the working stability is because the bubbles can leave the electrode surface very quickly (Fig. 4c). In addition, glucose oxidation coupled with solar-driven water electrolysis is evaluated since the hydrogen production by conversion of solar fuel is a low-cost, green, and sustainable route.31 As shown in Fig. 4d and the ESI† Video, a commercial polycrystalline silicon solar cell is deployed to utilize solar energy for hydrogen generation. Obviously, a lot of small H2 bubbles are generated at the cathode, while no gas bubbles are seen at the anode, indicating a promising application of the plasma-treated CNF in low-energy-consumption hydrogen production coupled with the synthesis of value-added products.

In summary, we reported an oxygen plasma treatment to boost the electrocatalytic performance of cobalt–nickel foam (CNF) used for glucose oxidation coupled with hydrogen production, showing a much smaller overpotential and good stability. Electrochemical tests illustrated that the O2 plasma treatment endowed the CNF with abundant high-valence Co3+, enhanced glucose response, large electrochemical surface area and fast charge transport kinetics, which promoted the oxidation of glucose and enhanced the hydrogen production activity. This work provided a facile and simple strategy to manipulate the surface valence states of the Co-based electrocatalysts for glucose-assisted electrocatalytic water splitting.
