    , Accepted 14th December 2021First published on 16th December 2021AbstractConsidering the increase in drug resistance due to the abuse of antibiotics, the development of non-conventional antibiotics for the treatment of bacterial infections is necessary and urgent. In this study, copper deposited diatom-biosilica (Cu–DBs) was developed by a hydrothermal method for infected wound therapy. The deposition of Cu on Cu–DBs could significantly improve the photothermal and photodynamic performance of DBs, thereby increasing the yield of reactive oxygen species (ROS) under 808 nm laser irradiation. The light capture effect of DBs gave Cu–DBs stronger photothermal performance than Cu–NPs and significantly strengthened the sterilization effect of Cu–DBs. Cu–DBs (6:5) achieved almost 100% antibacterial efficiency against S. aureus and E. coli within 10 min, due to the synergistic effect of photothermal and photodynamic performance. In vivo experiments confirmed the antibacterial properties of Cu–DBs for infected wounds and proved that Cu–DBs could accelerate wound healing by inhibiting inflammation, promoting collagen deposition, adjusting the ratio of the type-III collagen to type-I collagen and promoting angiogenesis. Our study suggested that Cu–DBs possessed enhanced photothermal and photodynamic performance and had great potential in infected wound therapy.
Introduction
Pathogenic bacterial infection is the common complication during wound healing, which can lead to overreactive immune response, retard collagen synthesis, delay wound healing and even threaten human life.1,2 Traditional therapy is heavily dependent on antibiotics, easily leading to the emergence of drug-resistant bacteria and a sharp decline in therapeutic effects.3,4 The relatively slow development of new antibiotics makes infected wound therapy more difficult, which has brought about a high demand for non-conventional antibiotic therapeutic methods.5 The photodynamic therapy (PDT) and photothermal therapy (PTT) based on bioactive materials provide alternative strategies for infected wounds, because of their broad-spectrum antimicrobial properties, low drug resistance and remote controllability.6–9 PDT generates ROS through photosensitizers, thereby destroying bacterial proteins or DNA/RNA, while PTT can transform light energy into heat energy through near-infrared (NIR) irradiation, destroy cell membranes and protein structure through temperature increase, and cause irreversible damage to bacteria.10 Based on the Arrhenius equation, increasing temperature can accelerate the rate of chemical reactions. Therefore, combination of PDT and PTT, through increasing the temperature of infection sites to enhance the catalysis rate of photosensitizers is a desired antibacterial strategy.11,12 In the past decades, various inorganic materials, such as carbon-based nanomaterials, metal oxides, metal chalcogenides and precious metal nanoparticles, have been proven to have ROS catalytic activity; some of them exhibited both photothermal and photodynamic properties, which can eradicate different types of bacteria, even drug-resistant bacteria.13 However, the treatment performance of these nanomaterials is still restricted in vivo, because of their potential toxicity, limited catalytic ability and photothermal conversion efficiency. Achieving enhanced photothermal along with photodynamic performance of inorganic materials is still challenging for antibacterial treatment.
Copper-based nanoparticles (Cu–NPs) exhibit robust and broad-spectrum antimicrobial properties (including both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria).14–16 Cu-NPs can catalyze a low concentration hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) into highly active and toxic ·OH through Fenton-like catalytic reactions to destroy bacteria.17 Due to the 3d electron transition of Cu-NPs, they show strong near-infrared absorption capacity, which can generate hyperthermia to fight bacteria.18–20 In addition, it has been reported that Cu ions have the ability to promote cell migration, collagen deposition, angiogenesis and accelerate wound healing.21 Unfortunately, Cu-based metal nanoparticles for wound healing still present clinical challenges, due to the potential biological toxicity of local high concentrations of Cu ions released from materials. Such potential toxicity to the human body will be significantly reduced, through the slow release of Cu ions.22,23
Diatom biosilica (DB) is the frustule formed by mineralization during the diatom growth process. The hierarchical porous structure of DBs gives it ultrahigh porosity and huge surface areas, which has already been used in the fields of drug delivery, catalysis, adsorbents, electrode materials, etc.24–30 Our previous research showed that diatom biosilica based materials have the advantages of high efficiency, being rapid and safe and having a simple preparation process, and is expected to be a rapid haemostatic agent.31,32 It is noteworthy that the elegant micro- to nano-scale porosity characteristics of DBs through millions of years of evolution provide living diatoms with extremely high solar energy harvesting efficiency for adapting to low light conditions underwater, which reveal their promising applications in the photothermal field as well.33 DBs have favorable biocompatibility and biodegradability and the SiO32− ions released from DBs have been proved to accelerate wound healing, manifest reducing inflammation, and promote collagen deposition and angiogenesis.34,35
Considering the high light capturing effect of DBs, the catalytic activity and photothermal performance of Cu-NPs, along with the tissue regeneration ability of both SiO32− and Cu2+, we developed multifunctional copper diatom-biosilica, which could serve not only as a bioactive material for combined photodynamic and photothermal antimicrobial therapy, but also as a healing agent for infected wound healing. Herein, we successfully prepared copper deposited DBs (Cu–DBs) by a simple hydrothermal method (Fig. 1a). Such materials have been demonstrated to be used in combination with PDT and PTT in a single platform. Both in vitro and in vivo, Cu–DBs show a significant antibacterial effect. Furthermore, the Cu–DBs can not only promote the proliferation of skin cells (L929), but also accelerate wound healing in the rat infectious wound model. This study provided a novel strategy utilizing optical characteristics of natural DBs and the catalytic activity of metal nanoparticles for infected wound therapy (Scheme 1).

Experimental
Materials
Concentrated sulfuric acid (H2SO4) and CuSO4·5H2O were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd (China). LB Broth and LB Nutrient Agar were purchased from Solarbio Science & Technology Co., Ltd (Beijing, China). All other reagents in the experiment were of analytical grade. LIVE/DEAD BacLight Bacterial Viability Kit L-7012 was purchased from Invitrogen (The United States). S. aureus and E. coli were obtained from Biochemistry and Biomaterials Laboratory, Ocean University of China.
Preparation of diatom biosilica (DBs)

C. cryptica was cultivated in sterile seawater enriched with Guillard F/2 Medium at 21 °C under a light of intensity 3000 lx, with a light/dark rhythm of 12/12 h. The algal mud was collected by centrifugation at 8000 rpm when cultured to a concentration of million-level. DBs were prepared by acid oxidation in two steps. The first step was alkali treatment. Firstly, 32% NaOH and 16% urea (1:1) were mixed. The algal mud was added to the mixture and thoroughly stirred, then frozen twice and washed repeatedly. The second step was acid treatment. The piranha solution was prepared according to H2SO4:H2O2 = 7:3. The piranha solution was added to the treated algal pulp and stirred at 75 °C for 1 h. After adjusting the pH to neutral with NaOH, DBs were obtained and washed several times with distilled water and dried.
Preparation of copper diatom biosilica (Cu–DBs)
Cu–DBs were synthesized by a hydrothermal reaction. For Cu–DBs (1:5), the prepared DBs (20 mg) were evenly dispersed in distilled water (9 mL), and then CuSO4·5H2O (16.6 mg) and NH3·H2O (1 mL) were added. The mixture was transferred to a reaction kettle with a PTFE liner and maintained at 140 °C for 2 h. The collected blue precipitate was rinsed with distilled water 3–4 times and dried. For Cu–DBs (2:5), Cu–DBs (4:5) and Cu–DBs (6:5), different contents (33.2 mg, 66.4 mg or 99.6 mg) of CuSO4·5H2O were added, respectively.
Material characterization
The morphology and microstructure of DBs and Cu–DBs were studied by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM). Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDXS, SEM, JSM-6010La, Jeol Ltd, Japan) was used to analyze the surface elements of the materials. The contents of Cu and Si in DBs and Cu–DBs were analyzed by ICP-AES. Thermogravimetric differential scanning calorimetry (TG-DSC, Netzsch Ltd STA449F3, Germany) was used to analyze the thermal stability of the materials. The zeta-potential test (Malvern Ltd) was used to characterize the zeta potential of DBs and Cu–DBs. The phase composition of DBs and Cu–DBs was determined by X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD). UV-Vis-NIR absorptions of DBs and Cu–DBs were measured between 200 nm and 1000 nm (UV-2700, Japan). The photoluminescence (PL) spectra of DBs and Cu–DBs were measured using a fluorescence spectrophotometer (LS-55, American PE) with an excitation wavelength of 360 nm. X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (Escalab 250XI, Thermo Scientific, USA) was used to determine the chemical composition of materials. The release of SiO32− and Cu2+ was respectively detected by ICP-AES after immersing Cu–DBs and DBs in PBS (pH = 7.4) at certain times (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10 and 14 days).
Photothermal performance of Cu–DBs
DBs and Cu–DBs powders (0.05 g) were placed on a 24-well plate and exposed to a laser (808 nm, 0.65 W cm−2) for 10 min and the temperature change was recorded using an IR-camera. To evaluate the photothermal stability, Cu–DBs powders were exposed to a laser (808 nm, 0.65 W cm−2) for 10 min and then placed in the dark for natural cooling. This cycle was carried out 5 times, and the heating–cooling curve was recorded using an IR-camera. The photothermal conversion efficiency of Cu–DBs was measured and calculated using a digital thermometer. Briefly, 2 mL dispersion of DBs or Cu–DBs (deionized water, 30 mg mL−1) were added into a 24-well plate, and irradiated for 10 min (808 nm, 2 W cm−2). The temperature was recorded using a portable digital thermometer (RKC DP-700, China). After turning off the laser, the temperature changes were monitored for another 20 min under natural cooling. Deionized water and copper powder were used as a negative control and a positive control, respectively. The photothermal conversion efficiency (η) of Cu–DBs was calculated according to eqn (1).36 (1)where h is the heat transfer coefficient, A is the surface area of the container, ΔTmax,mix is the temperature change of the DBs and Cu–DBs aqueous dispersion, ΔTmax,H2O is the deionized water at the maximum steady-state temperature, I is the laser power, and Aλ is the absorbance of DBs and Cu–DBs at 808 nm.
The complete derivation formula of the photothermal conversion efficiency is shown in the ESI.†
Photocatalytic properties detected by H2DCFDA
The ROS generated by DBs and Cu–DBs under 808 nm laser irradiation were measured by a 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (H2DCFDA) method.37 The 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein (DCF) working solution was prepared by mixing 10 μL of reserve solution (1 mg mL−1 of H2DCFDA ethanol solution) and 1384 μL of 0.01 mol L−1 NaOH solution and then adding 7000 μL of PBS solution (pH = 7.4), under dark conditions. 1600 μL DCF working solution and 400 μL of 2.5 mg mL−1 DBs or Cu–DBs suspension were subsequently added to a 96-well black plate. The laser treatment group was irradiated with a NIR light (808 nm, 2 W cm−2) for 10 min. The non-laser treatment group was placed in the dark for 10 min. Then all samples were incubated at room temperature for 2 h. The fluorescence emission spectra of DCF (510–610 nm) were collected using a microplate analyzer at an excitation wavelength of 490 nm.
Photothermal antibacterial property assay

Bacteria culture. 

S. aureus and E. coli were used as bacterial models. First, S. aureus and E. coli were inoculated into a 20 mL LB broth medium at 37 °C for 10 h and shaken at 120 rpm. Then the colonies were detected by UV-Vis spectroscopy.


Antibacterial assay. 
The photothermal antibacterial effect of Cu–DBs was evaluated by a colony forming count method. A 200 μL bacterial suspension (1 × 106 CFU mL−1) was incubated with 1.8 mL LB culture medium containing a series of DBs and Cu–DBs with concentrations from 0 to 6 mg mL−1 in a 24-well plate. Another group was irradiated with a NIR laser (808 nm, 2 W cm−2) for 10 min. These solutions were continuously diluted to a bacterial concentration of 1 × 102–1 × 103 CFU mL−1 after being oscillated at 37 °C for 3 h. 1 mL of bacterial liquid was applied to the LB plate and cultured at 37 °C for 24 h to count the bacterial colonies on the plate. The antibacterial rates of the materials were calculated using eqn (2). (2)
The cell membrane integrity and bacterial population viability of S. aureus and E. coli treated with different materials were assessed using Live/Dead bacterial staining kits. The kit contained two fluorescent dyes, SYTO9 and PI, which color live and dead bacteria green and red, respectively. SYTO9 was a green fluorescent dye, which could stain the nucleic acid of live and dead bacteria. PI was a red fluorescent dye that only stained dead bacteria with damaged cell membranes. When combined with SYTO9 and PI, live bacteria emitted green fluorescence, while dead bacteria with damaged cell membranes emitted red fluorescence. E. coli and S. aureus (1 × 106 CFU mL−1) were inoculated with different concentrations of DBs and Cu–DBs in a 24-well plate and irradiated under a 2 W cm−2 NIR laser for 10 min. Then the mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 3 h and rinsed with PBS 2–3 times to remove medium traces. Then a 3 μL SYTO9/PI mixture was added to each 1 mL of the sample mixture according to the instructions in the kit and incubated under dark conditions (15 min, room temperature). Finally, the images were observed using a fluorescence microscope.
The morphology of bacteria after different treatments was examined by SEM. The bacterial suspensions of the different treatment groups were immobilized with 2.5% glutaraldehyde for 2 h at 4 °C. Then the samples were treated with different concentrations of ethanol for 10 min to dehydrate the cells. The samples were supercritically dried and examined by SEM.


In vitro hemolysis test
The hemolysis ratio of DBs and Cu–DBs at different concentrations was measured. The samples were dispersed in saline solution and the mixture would be incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. 60 μL RBC dispersion was added into a 3 mL sample, and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The mixture was centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 5 min. Finally, the absorbance of the supernatant was measured using a UV-Vis spectrophotometer (UV-1200 MAPADA, China) at 545 nm. Saline and distilled water were used as a negative control and a positive control, respectively. The hemolysis rate (HR, %) was calculated using eqn (3). (3)
where Ds is the absorbance of the samples, Dp is the distilled water, and Dn is the saline.
Cytotoxicity evaluation
The cytotoxicity of the materials to the mouse fibroblast (L929) cell line was evaluated using a calcein-AM/PI mixed dye. L929 cell suspension (2 × 105 cell mL−1) was added into a 24-well plate and incubated for 12 h. Then the medium was replaced with a medium containing 0.5 mg mL−1 DBs or Cu–DBs (6:5), respectively. The cells in the laser group were then irradiated with an 808 nm NIR laser (2 W cm−2) for 5 min and then cultured in the dark. After 24 h and 48 h culture, the mixture medium was removed and stained with the calcein-AM/PI mixed dye. After staining, the cells were rinsed with PBS 3 times and observed using a fluorescence microscope (Nikon TS 100, Japan).
Animal infection wound healing test
A full-thickness skin defect model infected by S. aureus was established to further evaluate the effect of Cu–DBs for infectious wound healing. Male rats weighing 200–220 g were randomly divided into 3 groups (n = 5): the control group, the DBs group and the Cu–DBs (6:5) group. 1% pentobarbital was injected intraperitoneally to anesthetize the rats. Then the hair on the left side of rat back was shaved. For each rat, a full-thickness resection (diameter 1 cm) was made on the left side of the back, and a silicone ring model was established to avoid wound contraction. 100 μL S. aureus (1 × 108 CFU mL−1) suspension was applied to the wound and an infection model was established 24 hours later. The DBs and Cu–DBs (6:5) groups were given 100 μl DBs and Cu–DBs (6:5) (4 mg mL−1) at 0, 3 and 7 days, respectively. The wound area was irradiated with an 808 nm NIR laser (2 W cm−2) to 50–55 °C for 5 min. After treatment, the wound was bound up with sterile gauze. All the wounds were photographed at 0, 3, 7, 14 and 21 days, and the area of the wounds was measured using the ImageJ software. The wound closure rate was calculated using eqn (4). (4)where A0 and At are the initial wound area and the wound area at a determined time point, respectively.
Histological and immunohistochemical analysis: At 3, 7, 14 and 21 days, one rat from each of the three groups were sacrificed. And the skin tissues near the wound were collected for histological and immunohistochemical analysis. Histopathological changes in wound healing were observed through Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) staining, and collagen formation was evaluated using Masson's trichrome staining. Inflammatory pleiotropic cytokine (TNF)-α along with anti-inflammatory factors IL-4 and IL-10 was chosen for immunohistochemical staining to assess inflammation in wound healing. The ratio of the type-III collagen to type-I collagen in the process of wound healing was also evaluated by immunohistochemistry. Vascular endothelial cell marker CD31 was chosen for immunohistochemical staining to evaluate angiogenesis in wound healing. The production of HSP90 by thermal stimulation was also assessed by immunohistochemistry.
QINGDAO Food and Drug Administration (Qingdao, China) provided experimental animals. In this study, all the protocols for animal experiments were approved by the Experimental Animal Ethics Committee of College of Marine Life Science, Ocean University of China, and the laboratory animal guidelines of welfare and ethics (China) were complied.
Statistical analysis
The experiment was carried out 3–5 times on different occasions. The data in this study were expressed in mean and standard deviation, denoted as “mean ± SD” and statistically analyzed by one way analysis of variance with Origin, version 2018 (OriginLab Software Inc.). When the p value was less than 0.05, there is an indication of a statistical difference between the data.
Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization of Cu–DBs
DBs were achieved from cultivated C. cryptica, which was purified by the mixture of H2O2 and H2SO4 to remove organic matter as in the case of our previous report. The purified DBs were about 5 μm in diameter with a hierarchical porous structure, which is composed of three nested pore structures (primary circular sector pore: 800 nm in length, secondary circular pore: 30–50 nm in diameter, and tertiary circular pore: 1–2 nm in diameter, Fig. 1b). Then, DBs were kept in copper sulfate and ammonia mixture solution at 140 °C. The SiO32− generated from DBs reacted with Cu2+ to produce copper silicate, which gradually deposited on the surface of DBs to form Cu–DBs. With an increase in the ratio of Cu2+ added, the pore structures of Cu–DBs were gradually filled with copper silicate, and the surface morphology of Cu–DBs was changed from smooth to villiform. When the Cu:DB ratio reached 6:5, the villiform layer significantly thickened and a brush-like microstructure appeared on the surface of Cu–DBs (Fig. 1b).
The element mapping showed that the surface of the synthesized Cu–DBs was composed of C, O, Si and Cu with uniform distribution (Fig. S1, ESI†). The strong Cu signal was detected for Cu–DBs, which was not found for pure DBs (Fig. 2a). The EDS quantitative results indicated that Cu content on the surface of Cu–DBs increased from 6.31% to 12.56%, with an increase in the ratio of Cu2+ added. The highest Cu content was achieved in Cu–DBs (6:5), which was similar to that of Cu–DBs (4:5) (Fig. 2b), demonstrating that the deposition of Cu had reached saturation. With an increase in the amount of Cu deposited, the zeta potential of Cu–DBs increased from −37.83 ± 1.90 mV to −30.9 ± 0.08 mV. This phenomenon demonstrated that the deposition of copper silicate could reduce the content of free Si–OH of DBs, and thus reduced its surface charge (Fig. 2c). The content trend of Cu and Si in DBs and Cu–DBs determined by ICP was consistent with that of EDS (Fig. 2d). DBs and Cu–DBs exhibited high thermal stability with little organic residue (Fig. S2, ESI†). The XRD patterns of Cu–DBs showed strong peaks at 19.98, 21.8, 31.14, 35.68, 58.42 and 63.14, indicating that the copper silicate contained in Cu–DBs was chrysocolla (Cu2–xSi2O5(OH)3·xH2O) (Fig. 2e).38 The XPS spectrum proved that the DBs contained O, C and Si and the Cu–DBs surface was composed of O, C, Si and Cu (Fig. 2f), which was consistent with that of EDS results. According to the narrow scan spectrum of Cu2p (Fig. 2g) in Cu–DBs, there were strong peaks of Cu2+ at 934.6 eV and 954.5 eV, and the signal intensity was enhanced with an increase in the ratio of Cu2+ added, till the ratio of Cu and Si reached 6:5. This phenomenon indicated that the Cu2+ in the Cu2p–O bond was instead metallic Cu, which confirmed that Cu was successfully deposited on the DBs surface through the Cu–O bond to form a copper silicate deposited layer.39,40 Considering the factors of the microstructure and deposited Cu content, Cu–DBs (1:5) and Cu–DBs (6:5) were selected for subsequent experiments.

Photothermal performance of Cu–DBs
It has been reported that Cu-based chalcogenides can strongly absorb NIR due to the 3d electron transition of Cu ions from the valence band (VB) to the intermediate band (IB).38 The results of UV-vis absorption spectra showed that the light absorption capacity of Cu–DBs varied with the amount of Cu2+ deposited (Fig. 3a). At a wavelength of 808 nm, the absorbance of different DBs increased in sequence, followed by DBs, Cu–DBs (1:5), Cu–DBs (2:5), Cu–DBs (4:5) and Cu–DBs (6:5). The temperature of Cu–DBs powders increased quickly after 808 nm laser irradiation (0.65 W cm−2, 10 min) and the maximum temperature was increased with an increase in the ratio of Cu2+ added, which could reach 127.5 °C in Cu–DBs (6:5) (Fig. 3d and Fig. S3, ESI†). In contrast, a slight temperature change was observed in pure DBs powders, whose temperature only increased from 25 °C to 28.5 °C under laser irradiation. After 5 cycles of ON/OFF laser irradiation, the temperature change of Cu–DBs powders remained constant, suggesting the highly photothermal stability of Cu–DBs (Fig. S4, ESI†).

The photothermal conversion efficiency (η) was detected by monitoring the temperature change of aqueous dispersion of Cu–DBs. To further evaluate the role of the light capture effect of DBs in the photothermal performance of Cu–DBs, Cu nanoparticles with 10 nm in diameter were used as the control. After the NIR laser irradiation (10 min), the temperature of the aqueous dispersion of Cu–DBs (6:5) reached 62.7 °C (Fig. 3b), while the temperature of the aqueous solution of Cu nanoparticles and DBs could only reach 52.8 °C and 41.4 °C, respectively. According to calculation, the highest photothermal conversion efficiency (42.26%) was achieved in Cu–DBs (6:5), which was about 1.72-fold compared to that of Cu nanoparticles and 2.63-fold compared to that of DBs (Fig. S5, ESI†). This phenomenon was attributed to the synergy effect of Cu and DBs. The Cu mainly affected light absorption and light-heat conversion, while the DBs assisted in two aspects: on the one hand, the hierarchical porous structure and the strong asymmetry between the cribrum and foramen pseudo-periodic structures of DBs gave Cu–DBs with highly efficient light trapping efficiency, which could be used as natural photonic crystals, light focusing lenses and light captors.41–43 The Cu deposited on the surface of DBs could absorb more light to generate more heat. On the other hand, DBs were composed of high-purity porous silica, which might have lower thermal conductivity. It has been reported that the thermal conductivity of porous silica could be lower than 0.098 W mK−1.44 The 808 nm near-infrared laser was a thermal light source, and it produced heat in the irradiation process. The low thermal conductivity of DBs was conducive to reducing heat loss through self-insulation, which made the temperature of DBs also increase under laser irradiation. This feature also further enhanced the photothermal conversion efficiency of Cu–DBs.

(a) The process of Cu–DBs in the treatment of infectious wounds. The model of infected wounds was established and Cu–DBs laser treatment was given at 0, 3 and 7 days, respectively. (b) The specific mechanism of the Cu–DBs with enhanced photothermal and photodynamic performance for enhancing infected wound healing was as follows: (1) PDT produced ROS to inhibit antibacterial growth; (2) PTT generated heat to promote the PDT efficiency of Cu–DBs and kill bacteria, stimulate HSP90 production, thereby promote angiogenesis and accelerate blood flow at the wound site; (3) continuous release of Cu2+ and SiO32− promoted wound cell migration, differentiation, angiogenesis and collagen deposition. 
Photocatalytic properties of Cu–DBs
The ROS production capacity of Cu–DBs was evaluated by a DCF method with or without laser irradiation. H2DCFDA itself was not fluorescent. H2DCFDA was activated to DCFH when mixed with NaOH. The ROS generated by the materials can oxidize the non-fluorescent DCFH to generate fluorescent DCF. The level of ROS generated can be determined by measuring the fluorescence of DCF. A previous study demonstrated that the surface free silanol groups of silicon could provide active sites for molecular oxygen to generate “surface bound ROS”.45 Our study confirmed this result. Compared with a blank group (Phosphate Buffered Saline, PBS), DBs exhibited higher fluorescence intensity with the absence of laser irradiation, and it increased slightly after laser irradiation, revealing the limited photocatalytic activity of DBs (Fig. 3e and f). In contrast, Cu–DBs exhibited much higher fluorescence intensity than DBs, which could significantly enhance about 77% after laser irradiation, demonstrating the enhanced photocatalytic performance of Cu–DBs. It is worth noting that the effect of the Cu content in Cu–DBs on ROS production was opposite when the test was performed with or without laser irradiation. With the absence of laser irradiation, Cu–DBs (6:5) exhibited higher fluorescence intensity than Cu–DBs (1:5). This phenomenon was due to the Fenton-like catalytic reaction induced by Cu2+, which determined the Cu content on Cu–DBs (Fig. 3g). In contrast, after laser irradiation, the fluorescence intensity in the Cu–DBs (1:5) group was significantly higher than that of the Cu–DBs (6:5) group. This occurrence might depend on the recombination speed of photoelectron electrons (Fig. 3g). According to the photoluminescence (PL) spectra, the significant decrease in the peak intensity of Cu–DBs was observed compared with those of the DBs, which demonstrated that the deposited Cu2+ could retard electron–hole recombination (Fig. 3c). This phenomenon was attributed to the trapping effect of Cu2+ in Cu–DBs for electrons. Although the PL intensity difference in Cu–DBs was small, it was noted that Cu–DBs (1:5) exhibited the lowest electron–hole recombination speed, thus leading to the highest photocatalytic oxidation reaction. And the increase of the PL peak indicated that the recombination speed of the photo-generated electrons (e−) and holes (h+) gradually becomes faster with the increase of Cu2+ deposition, especially for Cu–DBs (6:5). The introduction of a large amount of Cu2+ might have caused this phenomenon. As Cu2+ increased, more photo-generated electrons would be trapped to reduce Cu2+, and the reduced metal Cu would in turn consume photo-generated holes, leading to faster electron–hole pair recombination, and further resulting in a lower photocatalytic oxidation reaction.
Antibacterial property assay
Based on the abovementioned excellent photothermal and photocatalytic properties of Cu–DBs, the antibacterial efficiency of DBs and Cu–DBs was investigated with/without laser irradiation using S. aureus (Gram-positives) and E. coli (Gram-negative) as models. In the absence of laser irradiation, the bacteria treated with DBs grew as well as the control group, indicating that the pure DBs have no bacteriostatic ability without laser irradiation (Fig. 4a). But when the bacteria were treated with DBs and exposed to an 808 nm laser, the dosage-dependent antibacterial rate, which increased with an increase of DBs concentration, was observed and the maximum antibacterial rate could reached 55.54% for S. aureus and 60.5% for E. coli, respectively (Fig. 4b and c). According to the above DCF results of DBs, it could be considered that the certain antibacterial effect was due to the photocatalytic effect of DBs.
 Fig. 4  Antibacterial properties of Cu–DBs. (a) In vitro antibacterial activity of Cu–DBs with/without laser irradiation. DBs, Cu–DBs (1:5) and Cu–DBs (6:5) (from 0 to 6 mg mL−1) with S. aureus and E. coli were exposed to laser irradiation (808 nm, 2 W cm−2) or kept in the dark for 10 min, then incubated at 37 °C for 24 h; statistical results of the corresponding antibacterial activity of (b) S. aureus and (c) E. coli (mean ± SD, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, and ***p < 0.001, n = 3); and (D) typical fluorescence images of S. aureus and E. coli by various treatments. Green and red stains. 
The antibacterial rate of Cu–DBs increased with concentration increase whether under laser irradiation or not. In the absence of laser irradiation, Cu–DBs (6:5) exhibited a higher antibacterial rate than Cu–DBs (1:5) at either concentration, which was even above 95% at 6 mg mL−1. These results were consistent with the ROS production of Cu–DBs without laser irradiation. The more Cu content gave Cu–DBs (6:5) more ROS production capacity, thereby exhibiting a higher antibacterial effect without laser irradiation. When the Cu2+ content was 0.055 mg mL−1, the antibacterial rate of Cu–DBs (6:5) against S. aureus and E. coli was 3.46-fold and 2.30-fold compared to that of CuSO4·5H2O, respectively.
In addition, the ICP results showed that only a small Cu2+ content was released from Cu–DBs during 14 days incubation (Fig. S6, ESI†). The inhibition ring test showed that no significant inhibitory region was found in Cu–DBs (1:5) and Cu–DBs (6:5) groups (Fig. S7, ESI†). This indicated that the released Cu2+ from Cu–DBs was insufficient to provide an antibacterial effect. It was concluded that Cu–DBs mainly inhibited bacteria through contact inhibitory interactions, while CuSO4·5H2O has a free Cu ion to exert a bacteriostatic effect. Compared with unloaded free copper, DBs loaded copper can effectively control the release of Cu2+, thus greatly reducing the cytotoxicity to mammalian cells. Under laser irradiation, the antibacterial effect of Cu–DBs obviously strengthened, especially at low concentration. The antibacterial rate of Cu–DBs (6:5) groups at 0.5 mg mL−1 was only 39.95% for S. aureus and 31.32% for E. coli in the absence of laser irradiation, which could be strengthened by about 1.73-fold for S. aureus and 2.24-fold for E. coli after irradiation for 10 min. When the concentration of Cu–DBs (6:5) reached 6 mg mL−1, a completely antibacterial efficacy (100%) was achieved, which was about 1.02–1.05-fold compared to that of Cu–DBs (1:5) and 1.66–1.80-fold compared to that of DBs. This trend was due to the synergistic effect of the photothermal and photocatalytic performance of Cu–DBs (6:5), which diminished bacteria by heat generation and ROS production under laser irradiation.
The antibacterial ability was also tested with a LIVE/DEAD BacLight Bacterial Viability Kit L-7012 (green fluorescence: live bacteria, red fluorescence: dead bacteria). According to the above antibacterial experiments, 6 mg mL−1 was selected as the most effective concentration. For the control group, all S. aureus and E. coli cells survived well with/without laser treatment, as shown by lots of green fluorescence signals (Fig. 4d), which demonstrated that 808 nm laser irradiation (2 W cm−2) had no effect on the growth of bacteria. For DBs treated groups, some red fluorescence signals were observed after laser treatment. In contrast, the Cu–DBs (1:5) group and Cu–DBs (6:5) group detected part of the red fluorescence signal without laser irradiation, while after laser irradiation, the red spots almost occupied the entire area, indicating their strong antibacterial effect.
The morphology of the bacteria after different treatments was observed by SEM. The typical spherical S. aureus and rod-shaped E. coli were observed in the untreated blank group (Fig. 5). When the bacteria were treated with DBs and exposed to a laser, the cell membranes of S. aureus and E. coli were deformed and folded (red arrows in Fig. 5). More obvious damage to bacteria was observed in Cu–DBs (1:5) and Cu–DBs (6:5) treated groups (red arrows in Fig. 5), which manifested morphological defects and matrix outflow. The above results were consistent with the results of the spread plate and LIVE/DEAD fluorescence staining. Considering the antibacterial efficacy, Cu–DBs (6:5) was chosen for the following experiments due to its highest antibacterial ability.

In vitro hemolysis test
The hemolysis rate of DBs was concentration-dependent, which was increased with concentration, and the highest hemolysis rate of 27.39 ± 1.64% was reached at 6 mg mL−1 (Fig. S8, ESI†). The hemolysis rate of Cu–DBs (6:5) at different concentrations (from 0.5 to 6 mg mL−1) was less than 5%, indicating that Cu–DBs (6:5) had favorable blood compatibility. As in our previous reports, the silanol groups on the surface of DBs could induce the denaturation of membrane proteins through the electrostatic interaction with the erythrocyte membrane, thus causing hemolysis.35 The introduction of Cu significantly reduced the number of free silanol groups on the surface of DBs, which almost inhibited hemolytic activity completely.
Cytotoxicity evaluation
After 24 h and 48 h of treated incubation, the cytotoxicity of DBs and Cu–DBs (6:5) at 0.5 mg mL−1 exposed to L929 cells was qualitatively studied using the calcein-AM/PI mixed dye (Fig. 6). The results showed that all cells survived after 24 h incubation with DBs and Cu–DBs (6:5) without laser irradiation. After 48 h of co-incubation, the green fluorescence of the Cu–DBs (6:5) group increased, indicating that the cells grew well and the number of cells increased, while the green fluorescence in the DBs group decreased, and even faint red fluorescence appeared. Compared with the dark conditions, the green fluorescence of all groups was slightly reduced but only a little red fluorescence was observed after laser treatment, indicating that the laser treatment could affect cell proliferation but had no significant cytotoxicity.

Animal infection wound healing test

S. aureus-Infected rat models were established to evaluate in vivo antibacterial activity and the wound healing effect of Cu–DBs. After 5 min laser irradiation, the temperature of the wound treated with Cu–DBs (6:5) reached between 50 and 55 °C (Fig. S9, ESI†). In this temperature range, the wound could be effectively sterilized without damaging the normal tissues around the wound.46 After 3 days of treatment, severe ulceration of the wound in the control group accompanied by pus was observed, indicating a severe inflammatory response due to bacterial burden (Fig. 7a). For the DBs treated group, the infection was mild compared to that of the control group. At the same time, the Cu–DBs (6:5) treated group exhibited almost no infection and the highest wound closure degree (52.84%) (Fig. 7b). After 7 and 14 days of treatment, the wound treated with Cu–DBs (6:5) almost healed. While for the control group, the wound infection was still severe. After 21 days of treatment, the wound in the Cu–DBs (6:5) treated group was completely closed and even hair grew in new regenerative skin. This phenomenon indicated that Cu–DBs (6:5) could not only effectively kill bacteria with 808 nm laser irradiation, but also promote wound healing, especially in the inflammatory and maturation phase.

(mean ± SD, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, and ***p < 0.001, n = 5); and (c) H&E staining of wound tissues treated with DBs and Cu–DBs (6:5) at 3, 7, 14 and 21 days. 
The H&E staining was applied to evaluate the inflammation of wound tissue. The results showed that after 3 days of treatment, a large number of inflammatory cells appeared on all wound treated groups (Fig. 7c). After 7 and 14 days treatment, the number of inflammatory cells in the Cu–DBs (6:5) treated group was significantly less than those of the control and DBs treated groups and almost no vacuolating cells were observed in the histological section, indicating that Cu–DBs (6:5) had potential for inflammation inhibitory. After 21 days of treatment, the inflammatory cells in each group decreased, and hair follicle structures only appeared in the Cu–DBs (6:5) treated group, proving that Cu–DBs (6:5) can effectively inhibit inflammation in the early stage of wound healing.
To further study the anti-inflammatory action of Cu–DBs, the pro-inflammatory pleiotropic cytokine (TNF-α) along with anti-inflammatory factors IL-4 and IL-10 was detected. The former stimulated the body's local inflammatory response by promoting the adhesion of neutrophils and endothelial cells, while the latter two were mainly produced by Th2 cells, which participated in the whole process of inflammatory response and inhibited the development of inflammation.47 The relative area coverage of the pro-inflammatory factor (TNF-α) was similar among all groups after 3 days treatment. After 7 days treatment, the Cu–DBs (6:5) treated group exhibited the lowest expression of TNF-α (58.97%), followed by the DBs treated group (73.69%) and the control group (87.93%) (Fig. S10, ESI† and Fig. 8a). Compared with the control group, anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-4 and IL-10 were significantly increased in the DBs treated group and Cu–DBs (6:5) treated group, and the highest expression level was found in the Cu–DBs (6:5) treated group, which was about 1.35-fold and 1.42-fold compared to those of the DBs treated group and control group, respectively (Fig. S11, S12, ESI† and Fig. 8b, c). The above results confirmed that Cu–DBs (6:5) could effectively control inflammation by inhibiting the expression of TNF-α and stimulating the expressions of IL-4 and IL-10.

(Mean ± SD, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, and ***p < 0.001, n = 3). (d) Quantitative data of the area coverage of type-III collagen/type-I collagen. (Mean ± SD, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, and ***p < 0.001, n = 3). 
Collagen was an important component of the extracellular matrix, its scaffold-like structure could provide the growth basis for new blood capillaries and connective tissue during the proliferation phase. The collagen content was determined by Masson staining in this study. After 3 days treatment, serious infection and necrosis occurred in the control group and DBs treated group, which was not observed in the Cu–DBs (6:5) treated group (Fig. S13, ESI†). And after 21 days treatment, the staining intensity of the Cu–DBs (6:5) treated group was obviously higher than those of the control group and DBs treated group, demonstrating that a large amount of collagen fiber was regenerated.
In addition, the ratio of the type III collagen to type I collagen in the skin repair process was studied by immunohistochemical staining. After 3 days treatment, the highest ratio of the type-III collagen to type-I collagen was found in the Cu–DBs (6:5) treated group (1.32), which was about 1.10-fold and 1.25-fold compared to those of the DBs treated group and control group, respectively (Fig. S14, S15, ESI† and Fig. 8d). After 7 days treatment, the ratio of the type III collagen to type I collagen in the Cu–DBs (6:5) treated group reached 1.53, followed by the DBs treated group (1.36) and the control group (1.12). The above results indicated that in the proliferative phase of wound healing (0–7 days), the expression of the type-III collagen in each group was higher than that of the type-I collagen, and the highest expression of the type-III collagen was found in the Cu–DBs (6:5) treated group. The high expression of the type-III collagen could promote the proliferation of dermal fibroblasts, provide raw materials for the synthesis of collagen, and the damaged and aging skin can be filled and repaired.48 As the treatment progressed, the ratio of the type-III collagen to type-I collagen gradually decreased. After 14 days and 21 days of treatment, the ratio of type-III to type-I in the Cu–DBs (6:5) treated group was 0.91 and 0.66, respectively, which were lower than those in the DBs treated group and control group. In the mature stage of wound healing (14–21 days), the degradation of the type-III collagen and the increase of the type-I collagen could be observed in each group, and this phenomenon was most obvious in the Cu–DBs (6:5) treated group, which was beneficial for scar inhibition and wound healing.49 These results proved that Cu–DBs (6:5) could adjust the ratio of the type-I collagen to type-III collagen to promote wound healing.
The formation of new blood vessels was essential for wound healing, especially in chronic wound healing. The formation of new blood vessels during wound healing was evaluated as the expression content of vascular endothelial cell marker CD31 by an immunohistochemical method. During 21 days treatment, the relative area coverage of CD31 in all Cu–DBs (6:5) treated group was much higher than that in the control group, especially in the first 7 days of treatment, followed by that in the DBs treated group (Fig. 9a and b). As in the case of a previous report, Cu ions could regulate the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and promote angiogenesis by accelerating the proliferation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs).21 Meanwhile, it was also found that silicate ions at appropriate concentration could promote the proliferation of endothelial cells and increase the expression activity of angiogenesis-related genes and proteins.34 Our study confirmed these results. The pure DBs could promote angiogenesis by release of Si ions, and this performance could be strengthened by Cu deposition. In addition, it was reported that heat shock protein (HSP90) was an important molecular chaperone of angiogenesis molecules which had a facilitation effect on angiogenesis.50 HSP90 typically occurred when cells are subjected to external thermal stimuli. Immunohistochemical staining of the HSP90 results showed that compared with the control group, the expression of the HSP90 protein was significantly increased in the DBs and the Cu–DBs (6:5) treated groups during 21 days treatment (Fig. S16, ESI†). The highest expression was observed in the Cu–DBs (6:5) treated group after 7 days treatment, which was about 1.24-fold compared to that of the DBs treated group and 2.26-fold compared to that of the control group (Fig. 9c). These results indicated that the excellent photothermal performance of Cu–DBs (6:5) could induce the expression of HSP90 to accelerate wound healing by angiogenesis.

The data of the control group were set to 100% (Mean ± SD, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, and ***p < 0.001, n = 3). 
Conclusions
In summary, Cu2+ was successfully deposited on DBs through a simple hydrothermal method. When Cu2+ was introduced, the heat generation capacity and ROS production were enhanced due to the 3d electron transition of Cu and light capture ability of DBs. The inhibition rate of Cu–DBs (6:5) against S. aureus and E. coli could reach 100% after laser irradiation. At the same time, Cu–DBs (6:5) had favorable biocompatibility. The results of in vivo experiments showed that Cu–DBs (6:5) could effectively sterilize and accelerate infected wound healing. This work proved that Cu–DBs (6:5) was an innovative, safe, and effective material for the treatment of infectious wounds.

(a) UV-Vis absorption spectra of DBs, Cu–DBs (1:5), Cu–DBs (2:5), Cu–DBs (4:5) and Cu–DBs (6:5) aqueous dispersion at the same concentration; (b) photothermal curves of DBs, Cu–DBs (1:5), Cu–DBs (6:5) and Cu nanoparticles (30 mg mL−1) when irradiation with an 808 nm light (2 W cm−2); (c) PL spectra of DBs and Cu–DBs; (d) thermal images of DBs, Cu–DBs (1:5) and Cu–DBs (6:5) powders with 10 min laser irradiation (0.65 W cm−2); (e) the ROS production of 2.5 mg mL−1 DBs and Cu–DBs was determined by a DCF method without irradiation; (f) the ROS production of 2.5 mg mL−1 DBs and Cu–DBs was determined by the DCF method under laser irradiation; and (g) schematic illustrations of ROS generation of Cu–DBs with and without laser irradiation.	 

 	Scheme 1  The copper deposited diatom-biosilica (Cu–DBs) with enhanced photothermal and photodynamic performance for infected wound healing application. (a) The process of Cu–DBs in the treatment of infectious wounds. The model of infected wounds was established and Cu–DBs laser treatment was given at 0, 3 and 7 days, respectively. (b) The specific mechanism of the Cu–DBs with enhanced photothermal and photodynamic performance for enhancing infected wound healing was as follows: (1) PDT produced ROS to inhibit antibacterial growth; (2) PTT generated heat to promote the PDT efficiency of Cu–DBs and kill bacteria, stimulate HSP90 production, thereby promote angiogenesis and accelerate blood flow at the wound site; (3) continuous release of Cu2+ and SiO32− promoted wound cell migration, differentiation, angiogenesis and collagen deposition.
