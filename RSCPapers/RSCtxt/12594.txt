They have been characterized in detail and showed the photoelectric response, which demonstrated their potential in the application of photovoltaic devices.
With the increasingly serious energy crisis, research on high efficient but low cost solar cells becomes more important. Among numerous types of solar cells, the CuInxGa1−xS(Se)2 (CIGS) thin-film solar cell has attracted great interest due to its high power conversion efficiency and fine stability.1,2 However, the low availability of indium and/or gallium increases the production costs and hinders the development of CIGS thin-film solar cells.3,4 For years, scientists have been trying to find a substitute for CIGS that avoids using costly elements. Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS), which is a structural analogue to CIGS, has drawn much attention because of its earth-abundant composition.5–7 As a direct-gap semiconductor with a high absorption coefficient, CZTS is suitable in the application of thin-film solar cells. The reported photoelectric conversion efficiency of the CZTS-based solar cell has reached as high as 6.7%,8 which promotes the research on CZTS. On the other hand, the wet chemical approach to fabricate semiconductor films in solar cells using nanocrystal dispersion was put forward.7,9,10 This technique enables cheaper fabrication of photovoltaic films than the traditional physical methods, benefiting from the progress in synthesizing high quality semiconductor nanocrystals. Therefore, producing CZTS thin-film solar cells by a nano-chemical route may illuminate the way of reducing the high cost of solar energy. In the last two years, the CZTS nanocrystals have attracted intensive investigation.10–12
Herein, we report new wurtzite phase CZTS nanocrystals synthesized with the assistance of dodecanethiol. The traditionally obtained CZTS is always in the kesterite or stannite phase, which features a tetragonal crystal cell.12–16 But wurtzite phase CZTS, different from the traditional ones, has a hexagonal crystal cell. In this structure, the sulfur anions are hexagonally close packed to form the frame of the cell structure and then the cations occupy a half of the tetrahedral interstices of the sulfur frame. The band gap of the new wurtzite phase CZTS was measured as 1.4 eV. As a benefit from the ligands used in the synthesis, the shape of the as-obtained wurtzite CZTS nanocrystals can be well controlled. These nanocrystals can also be well dispersed in non-polar solvent and simply fabricated into the CZTS film by the direct liquid coating method.9 The film has a photoelectric response. Our report shows that this new wurtzite CZTS has potential in the application of photovoltaic devices.
Wurtzite CZTS nanocrystals were synthesized through a hot injection method. 0.10 mmol of CuCl2·2H2O, 0.05 mmol of ZnCl2 and 0.05 mmol of SnCl4·5H2O were first dissolved in 1 mL of dodecanethiol (DDT) under ca. 120 °C to produce a homogenous precursor solution of metal thiolates. Then the hot solution was injected into 2 mL of DDT and 2 mL of oleylamine (OAm) or 4 mL of oleic acid (OA) in a three-neck flask at 240 °C. The mixture soon became brownish and was maintained for 1 h to allow the growth of nanocrystals. Finally, the products were precipitated by ethanol and redispersed in cyclcohexane.

Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of the as-synthesized CZTS nanocrystals. It is noticed that the XRD patterns do not match accurately with the standard pattern of kesterite CZTS (JCPDS 26-0575). Instead, the experimental XRD patterns can be indexed to a new wurtzite phase CZTS. While the crystal cell of kesterite CZTS is an analogue to vertically expanded binary zinc-blende ZnS, wurtzite CZTS could be considered as the derivative of wurtzite ZnS. Therefore, the wurtzite CZTS crystal cell was constructed based on the wurtzite ZnS cell (See S1 in ESI† for details).17 In this structure, sulfur anions are hexagonally close packed; Cu(I), Zn(II) and Sn(IV) cations randomly occupy a half of the interstices of the sulfur anions. As shown in Fig. 1, the experimental patterns of two kinds of nanocrystals match well with our simulated pattern, indicating these nanocrystals have a wurtzite structure.

For reference, the stimulated XRD pattern of wurtzite CZTS and the XRD pattern of kesterite CZTS (JCPDS 26-0575) are shown below. The scheme of the proposed crystal structure of wurtzite CZTS is given in the top right corner. 
The key factor deciding the formation of wurtzite CZTS rather than kesterite CZTS is considered to be the dodecanethiol used in the reaction. Dodecanethiol could react with the metal cations to produce metal thiolates, which would decompose into corresponding sulfides at certain temperature.18–20 These thiolates help to balance the different reactivities of cations in solution. Due to the strong coordination with the metal cations exposing on the surface of nanocrystal, dodecanethiol also assists to passivate the obtained wurtzite CZTS. It is rational to speculate that dodecanethiol adjusts the chemical environment preferring the formation of hexagonal structures, which also occurred in the synthesis of wurtzite CuInS2.17
The additional capping agents (OAm and OA) coorperate with dodecanethiol to control the morphology of the nanocrystals. Fig. 2 shows two kinds of wurtzite CZTS nanocrystals with different morphologies obtained by using different ligands. By employing OAm, CZTS nanoprisms with width of 20 nm and height of 28 nm could be obtained (Fig. 2a). The HRTEM images (Fig. 2b and c) show the good crystallinity of the nanoprisms. The lattice fringes with an interplanar spacing of 0.33 nm are ascribed to the {100} planes of wurtzite CZTS, and 0.32 nm to the (002) plane. It indicates that the as-obtained nanoprisms grow along the [001] direction. With OA in the reaction, CZTS nanoplates could be synthesized (Fig. 2d), the thickness of which is ca. 14 nm. Fig. 2e reveals the interspace of the lattice fringes of the nanoplate is also 0.33 nm, in accordance with {100} planes. Related with XRD patterns shown in Fig. 1, it is easy to observe that the morphologies of the nanocrystals also make a difference in the intensity of diffraction peaks, especially the diffraction peak of (002). Nanoplates are inclined to horizontally align on the substrate, which results in the considerable enhancement of the diffraction intensity of the (002) peak.

In order to further prove that the four elements are all present in an individual nanocrystal, the composition analysis was conducted at the nanoscale. The EDS element mapping of a field of three nanoprisms in Fig. 3 confirms that Cu, Zn, Sn and S homogenously distribute among the nanocrystals, excluding the existence of compositional gradients within the nanoparticle or multiphase coexistence (see S3 in ESI† for the EDS element mapping results of CZTS nanoplates). Moreover, the quantitative analysis of EDS data reveals the average Cu/Zn/Sn/S ratio to be approximately 2∶1∶1∶4 (Fig. S2 in ESI†), which corresponds well with the elemental ratio of CZTS.

Fig. 4 shows the absorption spectra of the wurtzite CZTS nanocrystals which present high optical absorption from the visible to the near infrared spectrum. The band-gap energy of the wurtzite CZTS nanocrystals is determined by plotting the square of absorption coefficient (α) times photon energy (hν) versus hν. With approximation, the value is ca. 1.4 eV (See S2 in ESI† for calculation details). In the literature, the theoretical and experimental energy gaps of kesterite CZTS are reported to be Eg = 1.56 eV and Eg ≈ 1.4–1.6 eV,13 respectively. Our measured value of wurtzite CZTS indicates that the wurtzite structure may have narrower energy gap than the kesterite structure.

The electrical properties of the wurtzite CZTS nanocrystals have also been studied. The I–V curve has been measured (Fig. S3 in ESI), which shows that the resistivity of the wurtzite CZTS is 0.838 and 5.740 Ω·m synthesized with OAm and OA respectively. It proves they are typical semiconductors. The difference of the resistivity between the two samples may come from the ligands capped on the surface of the nanocrystals and the different morphologies of CZTS nanocrystals. The CZTS film was fabricated by dripping the concentrated nanocrystal dispersion on the Mo-coated glass substrate and dried naturally. A uniform film could be obtained by using tetrachloroethylene as the solvent,9 the low volatility of which allows slow deposition of nanocrystals. A post-anneal process was conducted at 350 °C in an Ar atmosphere to remove the ligands, then to improve the electrical conductivity of the CZTS film. Fig. 5 shows the I–V curves of the CZTS film tested in the darkness and under an illumination intensity of 100 mW·cm−2 (Xenon Lamp), AM1.5G. The conductivity of the CZTS film under light irradiation is nearly twice as higher as that of the CZTS film in darkness. The lumination excites electrons in the valance band to the conduction band and then increases the holes in the CZTS, which enhance the conductivity of the film. This fact also indicates the generation of photocurrent, demonstrating the potential use of wurtzite CZTS in solar energy conversion systems, such as the solar cell.21

In conclusion, new wurtzite phase CZTS nanocrystals with controlled size and shape have been successfully synthesized through a hot-injection method. This quaternary semiconductor with the wurtzite structure is seldom reported before. The structure was confirmed by XRD, HRTEM and EDS mapping. The absorption spectra indicate that the wurtzite CZTS nanocrystal has an optical band gap of ca. 1.4 eV. The resistivities of the wurtzite CZTS are measured to be 0.838 and 5.740 Ω·m synthesized with OAm and OA respectively. The CZTS film has been fabricated and showed enhanced conductivity under light irradiation. Our work provides a new phase of CZTS and this material may be a promising semiconductor for photovoltaic application.
