    , Accepted 9th February 2018First published on 9th February 2018AbstractA homogeneous 1:1 solution of tetraisopropoxytitanium(IV) and [Sn(OAc)(dmae)]2 precursors in toluene was used at 450 °C, under argon, to deposit p–n-type tin(II) oxide–titanium(IV) oxide nanocomposite thin film electrodes by a single step aerosol assisted chemical vapor deposition (AACVD) technique. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), X-ray diffractometry (XRD), Raman scattering, energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDX), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and UV-vis absorption spectrophotometry were conducted to characterize the thin film electrodes. The deposited thin film electrodes were tested for their applications in water photolysis. A comparison of the photoelectrochemical properties of the deposited SnO–TiO2 composite electrodes with those of pristine TiO2 and SnO electrodes fabricated from tetraisopropoxytitanium(IV) and [Sn(OAc)(dmae)]2, respectively, indicates a higher photocatalytic activity as compared to pristine TiO2. This is possibly due to the incorporation of p-type SnO, which effectively promoted the separation of photogenerated charge carriers to rectify electron transfer from SnO to TiO2, leading to the separation of electron–hole pairs. The combined synergistic effect of p-type SnO and n-type TiO2, flower-like morphology and augmented ability to absorb solar light produced a significantly enhanced photocurrent of ∼4.3 mA cm−2 at 0.7 V vs. Ag/AgCl electrode. No obvious photocurrent decay was noted for prolonged stability measurements of up to 60 min under one sun illumination of 100 mW cm−2. With such a facile synthetic strategy and enhanced performance profile, the resulting material provides inspiration for producing new p–n-type composite photoanodes for better PEC performance using similar strategies.
1. Introduction
The splitting of water by solar energy to produce hydrogen is widely recognized as a green technique to fulfil the growing global demand for clean and renewable energy.1,2 The efficiency of this technology mainly relies on the semiconductor materials acting as photoelectrochemical (PEC) catalysts and has led to the continuous evolution of various potential photocatalytic materials since Fujishima and Honda first demonstrated the solar driven PEC performance of TiO2.3 However, it remains challenging to find a material that is a stable photocatalyst with effective water splitting capability. TiO2 is an obvious candidate owing to its congenial photoactivity, cost-effectiveness, and exquisite chemical stability in aqueous solution, all of which have made it a hot topic in research on PEC conversion.4 To date, though, studies have indicated that the water splitting performance of pure TiO2 is not truly competitive and is substantially limited by its wide band gap (3.2 eV) and kinetically sluggish electron–hole separation and transportation efficiency.5 In order to overcome these limitations, the construction of TiO2-based heterostructures has been proposed to enhance the PEC efficiency of pure TiO2.6,7 Examples of this strategy include a wide range of TiO2-based heterogeneous photocatalysts such as noble metal/TiO2,8,9 carbon/TiO2,10,11 metal oxide/TiO212 and metal sulfide/TiO2.13,14 These have been extensively explored, resulting in improved photoactivities. A notably intriguing finding of these studies is the coupling of TiO2 with these materials, particularly the semiconductor oxides whose conduction bands are at a lower potential than that of TiO2. It is perceived that the electrons present in the conduction band of TiO2 can be transferred to the complementary semiconductor, thereby reducing the probability of electron–hole recombination. This provides efficient electron–hole separation, enhancing the water splitting performance and hence improving the photoconversion efficiency of the resulting composite. Therefore, a large number of composite nanomaterials, such as Fe2O3–TiO2,15 BiVO4–TiO216,17 and SnO2–TiO2,18 have been used for their promising PEC activity, with the improvements ascribed to efficient carrier separation at the heterojunctions.
Among various metal oxides, tin oxides have received a lot of attention because of their excellent photocatalytic properties. Tin oxides normally exist in two forms, i.e. Sn(IV) oxide and Sn(II) oxide and both forms exhibit good activity and stability under irradiation in both acidic and basic media. However, it is well known that Sn(IV) oxide exhibits low photocatalytic activity because of its larger bandgap (∼3.5 eV). In contrast, Sn(II) oxide has a much lower band gap (∼2.5 eV) and thereby absorbs more visible light from sunlight that Sn(IV) oxide cannot absorb. Therefore, Sn(II) oxide potentially performs well for photocatalytic and photovoltaic processes.19,20 In addition, the valence band maximum (VBM) of SnO, a p-type semiconductor metal oxide, is composed primarily of the fully occupied 2p orbital of the oxygen ion with large electronegativity, and the location of the VBM is 5.8 eV deep from the vacuum level.21 Thus, SnO may have potential as a novel photocatalyst. Despite this potential, there are only a few reports of the use of SnO nanostructures as photocatalysts, such as in photodegradation studies of organic pollutants.22,23 To the best of our knowledge, only a single report on the use of SnO for solar-driven PEC water splitting has been published, in which ultrathin SnO sheets with different thicknesses were synthesized by liquid exfoliation, demonstrating the thickness-dependent solar water splitting efficiency of p-type semiconductors.24 More importantly, the report leads to the hypothesis that a p–n composite of SnO and TiO2 could further enhance the PEC efficiency of water splitting. SnO, a p-type semiconductor, is capable of creating a p–n heterojunction with the n-type semiconductor TiO2. This would be highly efficient for transferring photogenerated electrons from the conduction band of TiO2. However, there is little experimental evidence of this theoretical mechanism in the field of photocatalysis, mainly due to the tendency of SnO to decompose into Sn and SnO2 at elevated temperatures.25 Unfortunately, for the growth of nanocrystalline TiO2, calcination under high temperatures is a necessary evil. Consequently, Sn monoxide was not probed in as much detail as SnO2 when coupled with TiO2 as a photocatalyst.26 Recently, patterned SnO–TiO2 composites were prepared through the co-hydrolysis of tetrabutyltitanate and tin(II) chloride followed by acidic peptization of the hydrolysate under mild conditions.27 The photocatalytic activity of the composite was investigated by the photodegradation of methyl blue (MB) dye under visible light irradiation. It is noteworthy that the facile synthesis of stable forms of SnO is critically important for these composites to prevail and that the single step fabrication of SnO–TiO2 composite thin films through any chemical or physical vapor deposition method has not been reported so far.
Motivated by the above concerns, the purpose of the present work is two-fold: first, to develop a simple and cost-effective aerosol assisted chemical vapor deposition (AACVD) method for the growth of phase-pure SnO, TiO2 and composite SnO–TiO2 films directly on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrates; and second, to compare the PEC performance of the resulting SnO–TiO2 composite photoelectrodes with respect to the phase pure SnO and TiO2 systems. In the first phase, the deposition of SnO–TiO2 composite oxide films was achieved by employing a homogeneous solution of tin and titanium precursors in AACVD. A homogeneous solution of a self-designed and previously reported28 tin complex, [Sn(OAc)(dmae)]2 (where OAc = acetato and dmae = dimethylaminoethanolato), and commercially available tetraisopropoxytitanium(IV) was utilized as a precursor for the deposition of SnO–TiO2 composite films. The prepared films were comprehensively characterized by XRD, Raman, XPS, SEM/EDX and UV-visible spectrophotometry to establish the phase purity, elemental stoichiometry, morphology and optical properties, respectively. In the second phase, the PEC performances of all the film electrodes were systematically studied in terms of charge separation, charge transport kinetics, electrochemical reactions, and electrical conductivity.
2. Experimental
2.1 Film fabrication
All of the deposition experiments were performed using a custom-built AACVD setup as described in our previous work.29–31 All chemicals were used as supplied: titanium(IV) isopropoxide (Ti(ipro)4) (Sigma Aldrich), toluene (99.9%, Merck) and argon gas (99.99%). The tin precursor, [Sn(OAc)(dmae)]2, was prepared according to a literature procedure.28 For the preparation of pristine SnO and TiO2 thin films, each of the [Sn(OAc)(dmae)]2 (0.12 g, 0.40 mmol) and Ti(ipro)4 (0.11 mL, 0.40 mmol) precursors was dissolved separately in 20 mL toluene, while the SnO–TiO2 composite films were synthesized from a combined solution of both the precursors. In a typical SnO–TiO2 composite thin film deposition experiment, 0.12 g (0.40 mmol) of [Sn(OAc)(dmae)]2 precursor was dissolved in toluene (20 mL) in a Schlenk tube connected to a vacuum line. Upon adding Ti(ipro)4 (0.11 mL, 0.40 mmol), the solution color changed to pale yellow. The clear solution was stirred for 2 hours and the yellow color remained persistent. Evaporation of the solvent under reduced pressure gave a yellow solid, which was re-dissolved in toluene (15 mL). The transparent yellow solution was stirred for 10 minutes and was used in AACVD for film deposition. Prior to the deposition, the FTO and plain glass substrate was cut to an area of 1.0 × 2.0 cm2 (W × L) and sequentially washed using soapy water, acetone, and ethanol. The substrate was then laid horizontally inside the reactor tube and heated to the deposition temperature of 450 °C for 10 min to stabilize the temperature before carrying out the deposition. An aerosol mist of the precursor solution was generated using a piezoelectric ultrasonic humidifier. Argon gas was used as a carrier gas to transport the aerosol to the heated substrate at a rate of 120 cm3 min−1. The reactor exhaust was vented into a fume cupboard. When the precursor solution and the associated aerosol mist had been completely emptied from the flask, the coated substrate was cooled under a continuous flow of Ar gas until the temperature was below 40 °C, then it was removed from the reactor.
2.2 Film characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded using a PANalytical X'Pert HighScore diffractometer with primary monochromatic high intensity CuKα (λ = 1.5418 Å) radiation. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images were obtained using a TESCAN LYRA3 field emission gun (FEG) at an accelerating voltage of 5 kV and a working distance of 10 mm. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX, INCA Energy 200, Oxford Inst.) was also carried out in order to determine the Sn/Ti metallic ratio. Raman spectroscopic measurements were carried out on a Renishaw inVia Raman microscope and excitation was performed using the 514 nm line of an argon laser with 0.01 mW output power. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was done using an ULVAC-PHI Quantera II with a 32-channel spherical capacitor energy analyzer under vacuum (1 × 10−6 Pa) using monochromatic Al Kα radiation (1486.8 eV) with a natural energy width of 680 meV. The carbonaceous C 1s line (284.6 eV) was used as a reference to calibrate the binding energies. UV/vis absorption spectrometry was carried out using a PerkinElmer LAMBDA 950 UV/vis spectrophotometer. An NIR spectrophotometer was used in the wavelength range of 300–900 nm and the film thickness was also measured using a KLA-Tencor P-6 Surface Profiler.
2.3 Photoelectrochemical (PEC) measurements
All the PEC tests were carried out in a conventional three-electrode, single-compartment quartz cell with a saturated potassium chloride/silver chloride electrode (Ag/AgCl) as the reference electrode and platinum foil as the counter electrode. The TiO2 and SnO–TiO2 photoanodes served as the working electrodes. The electrolyte comprised 0.1 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution. Linear sweeps and chronoamperometric photocurrents were measured by a Princeton Applied Research PAR VersaSTAT 3 electrochemical workstation. The potential was swept from −0.4 to +1.0 V vs. Ag/AgCl at a sweep rate of 10 mV s−1. The lifetime of the photogenerated charge carriers was measured by recording the Bode phase at open-circuit voltage. A 150 W xenon arc lamp coupled with an Air Mass (AM) 1.5 global filter (100 mW cm−2) was used as the light source.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 XRD studies

Fig. 1(a–c) represents a comparison between the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the pristine TiO2, SnO and composite SnO–TiO2 films grown on plain glass substrates. The diffraction peaks in Fig. 1(a) at 2θ = 25.4°, 37.0°, 37.9°, 38.7°, 48.1°, 54.0°, 55.2°, 62.9°, 69.0°, 70. 5°, 75.3° and 83.0° are observed as attributive indicators of the (101), (103), (004), (112), (200), (105), (211), (204), (116), (220), (215) and (224) crystal planes of the TiO2 tetragonal anatase phase (ICDD = 01-073-1764), suggesting the synthesis of a pure TiO2 anatase phase. Similarly, the XRD pattern in Fig. 1(b) clearly corresponds to the orthorhombic tin(II) oxide (SnO) crystal structure. The diffraction peaks at 2θ = 30.8°, 32.2°, 34.0°, 40.2°, 42.6°, 46.5°, 55.3°, 58.7°, 65.4°, 67.8° and 72.0° correspond to the (101), (011), (110), (111), (002), (200), (112), (211), (202), (022) and (220) diffraction planes, respectively, which is in agreement with the results for orthorhombic SnO (ICDD = 00-024-1342). The XRD pattern of the composite (Fig. 1(c)) shows the diffraction peaks of the SnO–TiO2 composite, indexed to orthorhombic SnO and tetragonal anatase TiO2. The peaks of the composite XRD pattern represent well-crystallized peaks of the SnO and TiO2 phases, showing that equal amounts of both phases are present and no phase transformation occurs. This observation is in contrast with a previous study of the SnO–TiO2 composite,27 in which it was observed that the peaks relating to Sn were rather weakly presented, possibly due to the relatively low content of SnO in the composite. No X-ray diffraction peaks corresponding to metallic Sn or other phases such as SnO2, Sn2O3 and Sn3O4 were observed, indicating the formation of phase-pure SnO. This observation is further confirmed by Raman and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Thus we concluded that the pristine SnO films produced in the present study were more pure than the SnO films deposited using radio frequency magnetron sputtering, which resulted in a mixture of various phases including SnO, Sn and Sn3O4.32 Therefore, it is obvious from the XRD studies that the synthesis route based on AACVD successfully achieves phase-pure TiO2, SnO and SnO–TiO2 composites composed of orthorhombic phase SnO with anatase TiO2 in a single step procedure.

3.2 Raman analysis
The TiO2 and SnO phases detected in the XRD patterns were further examined by FT-Raman spectroscopy. As shown in Fig. 2(a), the pristine TiO2 film has four Raman active modes at 143, 396, 517 and 639 cm−1, which are assigned to anatase TiO2.33 The Raman spectrum of pristine SnO (Fig. 2(b)) indicates a scattering peak at about 211 cm−1, which demonstrates the formation of single-phase SnO.34 It is interesting to note that in the composite film (Fig. 2(c)), the peak positions of TiO2 (140, 416 and 646 cm−1) and SnO (220 cm−1) are a little bit shifted from the positions of their pristine counterparts. The peaks of the pristine materials are quite sharp and well-oriented. Contrastingly, in the case of the composite, the peaks are broadened and are slightly shifted from the positions of the corresponding pristine components. This is due to the fact that the bond structure and bond compactness are slightly different in the pristine materials as compared to the composite material. The pristine materials have bond structures in which vibrations occur more easily than in the composite materials, which are compactly intercalated and less free to vibrate. Literature studies also report phenomena in which nanocrystalline composite oxides have higher Raman band intensities.35 Moreover, the Raman bands of nanocrystalline composite materials are shown to shift higher with an increase in the compactness of the structures.35 For the same reason, in our study, the absorption bands were shifted when the composite material was studied.

3.3 SEM Investigations

Fig. 3 illustrates the morphologies of the films investigated by SEM. The morphology of the pristine TiO2 film indicates that it consists of star shaped particles with sharp edges and clear boundaries. These particles are uniformly distributed across the substrate surface, as shown in Fig. 3(a and a1). The thickness of the compact TiO2 layer is measured to be ∼11.0 μm from its cross-sectional SEM image (Fig. 3(a2)). The morphology of the pristine SnO film, unlike its TiO2 counterpart, comprises aggregated nanoparticles with an average thickness of ∼12.0 μm (Fig. 3(b, b1 and b2)). Overall, the SnO film surface is not smooth and nanoparticles are grown in a vertical direction, as seen from the cross-sectional view of the film (Fig. 3(b2)). However, this film has a more porous morphology of nanoparticle aggregates that could enhance the interfacial area of interaction when it comes to photocatalytic activity. To our surprise, the SnO–TiO2 composite film attains a morphology (Fig. 3(c and c1)) that is significantly different to that of the individual oxide components and seems more suited to its application in PEC. The film surface is covered with petal-like objects that are homogeneously deposited on the substrate surface without aggregation. Such a surface morphology could potentially harvest significantly more energy from the sun and consequently utilize it in water splitting because of its unique structure. The significance of such structures in photocatalytic and energy applications has been discussed in recent reports,30 in which pure materials have been prepared with these particular morphologies. However, a nanocomposite with a heterojunction of two pristine semiconductor materials in a flower-like morphology without any appreciable impurities is another innovation of our work. Furthermore, the cross-sectional SEM image indicates that the SnO–TiO2 film is approximately 1.0 μm thick (Fig. 3(c2)). Overall, the film also appears to have a porous structure, which is beneficial for charge separation and transportation in PEC reactions.

The elemental compositions and purities of all the films were confirmed by energy dispersive X-ray analysis. The EDX spectra presented in Fig. S1(a and b) in the ESI† demonstrate the high purity of the TiO2 and SnO films. As expected, only Ti and O elements were found in the pristine TiO2, while Sn and O elements were detected on the surface of the pristine SnO film. Four different areas of the SnO–TiO2 composite film surface were analyzed by EDX and the atomic ratio of Sn to Ti was found to be about 0.9:1, confirming the formation of a 1:1 SnO–TiO2 composite material (Fig. S1(c), ESI†), as planned during the synthesis.
EDX mapping was conducted to obtain a visualization of Sn and Ti distribution in the composite film. The elemental maps (Fig. 4) show a homogeneous dispersal of Sn and Ti atoms throughout the film surface.

The deposited SnO–TiO2 composite films were uniform, robust and stable towards atmospheric conditions and exhibited strong adhesion to the FTO substrate as verified by the “Scotch tape test”. Further, the PEC measurements also reflect the stability of the composite oxide films during electrochemical reactions where only one film electrode was used to record all the PEC data.
3.4 XPS studies
The surface compositions and chemical purities of the SnO, TiO2 and SnO–TiO2 composite films were studied by XPS analysis. The survey scanned spectra (Fig. 5(a)) demonstrate that Ti and O elements exist in the pristine TiO2 film, while the pristine SnO film comprises Sn and O elements. The spectra of the SnO–TiO2 film indicate the presence of only the three Sn, Ti and O elements, indicating the formation of an impurity-free composite.

For the composite film, the atomic ratio of Sn to Ti is about 1:1, as calculated from the experimental XPS peak areas and their relative sensitivity factors, which is in good agreement with the EDX results above. The high resolution XPS spectra related to Ti 2p (460 eV) and Sn 3d (490 eV) were investigated in detail and are displayed in Fig. 5(b and c), respectively. Fig. 5(b) shows that there are two peaks in the Ti 2p region. The peak at 464.4 eV relates to Ti 2p1/2 and the other, located at 458.7 eV, refers to Ti 2p3/2. The splitting between Ti 2p1/2 and Ti 2p3/2 is 5.7 eV, as established in the literature36,37 for Ti in the Ti4+ oxidation state. In Fig. 5(c), the resolved peaks at binding energies of 485.8 and 494.2 eV correspond to Sn 3d5/2 and Sn 3d3/2 of SnO, confirming the formation of pure SnO in the composite film.38 Furthermore, the peaks for Ti 2p and Sn 3d in the composite show no shift compared with those in pure TiO2 and SnO, confirming that the structure and stoichiometry of TiO2 and SnO remain intact after the synthesis of the SnO–TiO2 composite.
3.5 Optical properties
The as-synthesized SnO, TiO2 and SnO–TiO2 composite films were subjected to UV-vis spectrophotometry for investigation of their light absorption properties. For comparison, the absorption spectra of all the films are plotted in Fig. 6(a). It is noted that the optical absorption of the SnO–TiO2 composite film is highly scattering compared to that of the pristine TiO2 and SnO films. This observation is attributed to (i) the glossy surface of the SnO–TiO2 composite film observed by visual inspections, which causes the scattering of light, and (ii) the lower thickness and porosity of the composite film compared to its pristine components.

The TiO2 film shows an obvious absorption edge at about 450 nm with fundamental absorption in the UV region. The band gap of pristine TiO2 is estimated to be 3.1 eV from the linear approximation in the Tauc plot (Fig. 6(b)). The SnO film shows an absorption edge at around 580 nm, corresponding to a band gap of 2.5 eV in the Tauc plot (Fig. 6(a and c)). This value is in good agreement with the literature.39,40 The UV-vis spectrum of the SnO–TiO2 composite exhibits the combined characteristics of both TiO2 and SnO, and its bandgap is found to be 2.8 eV (Fig. 6(a and d)). The optical bandgap of pristine TiO2 is reduced by ∼0.3 eV after formation of the SnO–TiO2 composite, suggesting that the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes could be suppressed due to the synergistic cooperation of the two semiconductors in the composite material.41–43
3.6 Photoelectrochemical (PEC) investigations
To study the PEC behavior, TiO2, SnO and SnO–TiO2 films were fabricated on FTO substrates under similar AACVD conditions. A standard 3-electrode electrochemical cell with a Pt wire as the counter electrode and an Ag/AgCl reference electrode was used for all the PEC measurements in our experiments in 0.1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte solution. The photocurrent was measured under simulated sunlight illumination at 100 mW cm−2 from a 150 W xenon lamp coupled with an AM 1.5G filter. The linear-sweep voltammograms (LSVs) in Fig. 7(a) show the photoresponse of the TiO2 and SnO–TiO2 film electrodes upon forward biasing in dark and light conditions. The representative dark current densities acquired for each film sample under dark conditions (Fig. 7(a)) were used to quantitatively estimate the photocurrent densities obtained under illumination. Upon sweeping the potential from −0.4 to +1.0 V under illumination, the pristine TiO2 photoanode exhibited a low photocurrent density (∼0.4 mA cm−2) due to the poor light absorption properties of titania. However, the photocurrent for the SnO–TiO2 composite photoanode increased exponentially with increasing potential of the working electrode, and a photocurrent density of ∼4.3 mA cm−2 at 0.7 V vs. Ag/AgCl was obtained. Compared to that of pure TiO2, this is a significant enhancement in the photocurrent for SnO–TiO2. This suggests that charge separation is greatly enhanced in the composite photoanode compared to pure TiO2. This could be due to the improved light absorption properties of the SnO–TiO2 composite electrode due to the narrowing of the bandgap (∼2.8 eV) as compared to pristine TiO2 (3.1 eV). Another reason for this enhancement is the formation of a p–n junction when n-type TiO2 contacts p-type SnO, which rectifies the charge transfer between the materials.
 Fig. 7  (a) Linear sweep voltammograms (LSVs) of the pristine TiO2 and SnO–TiO2 composite photoelectrodes in dark and light conditions; (b) chronoamperometry (I–t) profiles of the pristine TiO2 and SnO–TiO2 composite thin films at an applied potential of +0.7 V versus Ag/AgCl under 100 mW cm−2 illumination (AM 1.5) in 0.1 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution. 
It is a well-known observation that the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes can be suppressed by forming p–n nano-heterojunctions. Several similar composite photoanodes, such as p-Cu2O/n-TiO2,44 p-MoO3/n-TiO245 and p-Cr2O3/n-WO3,46 have shown enhanced PEC activities. It is difficult to compare the activities of our films with those of these recently reported p–n heterojunction photocatalysts due to significant differences in the experimental conditions (light source, electrolyte, working potential). However, the photocurrent density measured for SnO–TiO2 (4.3 mA cm−2 at 0.7 V) is promising in comparison to that for the p–n junction oxide composites cited above.44–46 A table of comparisons with other SnO2–TiO2 photocatalysts is provided in the ESI† (Table S1).
The chemical and structural stability of the materials are important factors to evaluate the practicality of the PEC materials.47 The stability of both photoanodes (pristine TiO2 and SnO–TiO2 composite) was tested using a chronoamperometry technique, where the photocurrent was measured at a potential of 0.7 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) in the same Na2SO4 electrolyte (Fig. 7(b)) for an hour. The photocurrents of TiO2 (0.4 mA cm−2) and SnO–TiO2 (4.3 mA cm−2) remained constant for 60 minutes under one sun illumination of 100 mW cm−2. No obvious decay in the photocurrent was observed for the duration of the test, suggesting an excellent resistance to photocorrosion and potential applications of the pristine and composite films for long-term solar conversion. These experiments suggest that our SnO–TiO2 composite film has excellent stability and potential for long-term solar conversion applications. In addition, this result is also consistent with the photocurrent obtained using the LSV (Fig. 7(a)).
The formation of a p–n junction between SnO and TiO2 was proved by Mott–Schottky (MS) plots and electrochemical measurements. The Mott–Schottky measurements were carried out on all three electrodes (TiO2, SnO and SnO–TiO2) at a frequency of 1 kHz in 0.1 M Na2SO4 aqueous electrolyte in the dark. The results are shown in the MS plots in Fig. 8.

In the MS plot, a positive slope reflects the n-type nature of the semiconductor, while a negative slope reflects the p-type semiconductor.48,49 As shown in Fig. 8(a), TiO2, a well-known n-type semiconductor, exhibits a positive slope, while Fig. 8(b) shows a negative slope for SnO, which is indicative of a p-type semiconductor (Fig. 8(b)). This observation suggests that a p–n junction might be established between SnO and TiO2. With the formation of a p–n junction, the electron density on the SnO–TiO2 photoanode also increases significantly as compared to the pristine TiO2. The electron density of TiO2 is calculated to be 2.14 × 1019 cm−3, while that of SnO–TiO2 is 4.50 × 1019 cm−3, according to the following equation:49  where ND is the carrier density, C is the space charge capacitance, ε and ε0 are the permittivities of the electrode and free space, respectively, e0 is the elementary charge, and E is the applied potential.
Furthermore, the band positions of a semiconductor can be estimated by measuring the flat band potential (Efb), which appears as the x intercept of the linear portion of the MS plot.50,51Efb of the SnO electrode was estimated to be +0.9 V (vs. Ag/AgCl, Fig. 8(a)). The value for Efb of TiO2 (Fig. 8(a)) was determined to be −0.6 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) and is in agreement with reports in the literature.17,51 The difference in the Efb values for both SnO and TiO2 measured under identical conditions indicates that electron transfer from SnO to TiO2 is feasible because Efb is considered to be located above the conduction band of the n-type semiconductor. The MS measurements provide strong evidence for efficient rectifying charge transfer between SnO and TiO2, increasing the PEC activity for water oxidation under neutral conditions.
Furthermore, an electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) technique was applied to deduce information about charge separation, charge trapping and charge transfer at the interface of the photoelectrode/electrolyte. Fig. 9 displays the EIS Nyquist plots of the TiO2 and SnO–TiO2 electrodes in the frequency range of 0.1 Hz to 10 kHz in the dark and under light illumination. Fig. 9 shows that the pristine TiO2 electrode appears as the largest impedance-circle in the dark and has a larger charge transfer resistance (Rct) than the composite SnO–TiO2 electrode. However, the impedance-circle radius decreases rapidly under illumination without bias potential (shown in Fig. 9), indicating that the charge transfer reaction of the excited electrons from the VB to the CB occurs on the surface of the semiconductors.52,53 The Rct values of the electrodes measured under dark and light conditions are listed in Table 1.

The impedance spectrum of the SnO–TiO2 electrode shows the smallest arc radius and exhibits the lowest resistance value under light illumination. Normally, a smaller arc radius in the EIS Nyquist plot indicates the effective separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs and a fast interfacial charge transfer process.52,53 This implies that the coupling of SnO and TiO2 significantly facilitated the electron mobility by reducing the recombination of electron–hole pairs and contributing to the enhanced PEC performance in the SnO–TiO2 composite film.
To further confirm the enhanced charge separation in the composite material, the recombination times (τrec) of the majority carriers in the TiO2 and SnO–TiO2 electrodes were measured by recording their frequency dependence phase angle plots (Bode plots). The recombination times (τrec) of the photogenerated charges were estimated from the equation τn = 1/(2πfmax), where fmax is the frequency peak maximum in the Bode plot. The lifetime reflects the recombination probability of the photogenerated electrons and holes in the photoelectrode.54Fig. 10 shows the Bode plots of the TiO2 and SnO–TiO2 composites under dark and light conditions, respectively. Each curve shows a maximum, which tends to shift to a lower frequency upon the incidence of light. This means that the recombination time increases due to illumination.55 The lifetimes (τrec) for the TiO2 and SnO–TiO2 electrodes were calculated using the above equation and the results are displayed in Table 1. This indicates that the lifetimes of the photogenerated charges in the SnO–TiO2 electrode were about four times longer than those of the pristine TiO2 electrode. In other words, the separation of photogenerated charges in the SnO–TiO2 composite could be improved by increasing their recombination time, thereby facilitating the transportation of the majority of the photogenerated charges to the counter electrode. Likewise, the transport of photogenerated electrons to the electrolyte is enhanced.

To understand the enhancement of the photocatalytic performance of p-SnO–n-TiO2, a hypothetical mechanism is proposed as follows. As shown in Scheme 1, the conduction and valence bands of SnO22 are higher than those of TiO2.56,57 The contact of p-type SnO with n-type TiO2 forms a p–n heterojunction. Electrons are transferred from SnO to TiO2, while holes are transferred from TiO2 to SnO, until the system attains equilibrium between SnO and TiO2. Meanwhile, an internal electric field from TiO2 to SnO develops at the interface of SnO and TiO2. Under light illumination, both TiO2 and SnO are excited; the photogenerated holes in TiO2 and the electrons in SnO are driven to the valence band (VB) of SnO and the conduction band (CB) of TiO2, respectively, by the internal electric field. This transfer process is also thermodynamically favorable because both the VB and CB of SnO lie higher than the VB and CB of TiO2. Therefore, the charge separation of p-SnO/n-TiO2 is increased due to the internal electric field and band gap alignment.

Thus, by developing a p–n composite of two pristine materials with a specific morphology in a single step procedure, as shown here, several advantages can be obtained: (1) more effective charge separation; (2) rapid charge transfer to the photocatalyst; and (3) longer lifetimes of the charge carriers. All of these features bestow upon the p–n-type composite an enhanced photocatalytic performance for water splitting applications.
4. Conclusion
In summary, impurity-free porous and homogeneously distributed p–n SnO–TiO2 heterojunction structured thin films were formed via an aerosol assisted chemical vapor deposition method for possible applications in photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting. Investigations of the benign p–n SnO–TiO2 photoanode suggest that it possesses a higher photocatalytic activity as compared to pristine TiO2 and is stable under the reaction conditions. The higher photocatalytic activity is induced by the incorporation of p-type SnO, which effectively promotes the separation of photogenerated charge carriers and rectifies electron transfer from SnO to TiO2, leading to the in situ separation of electron and hole pairs. Results obtained from electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, Bode plot and flat-band potential measurements reveal that charge transfer from SnO to TiO2 is feasible under the specific limits of the experimental conditions pertaining to the described film parameters. This fundamental knowledge of the formation of specific structures of pristine nanocomposites via AACVD allows us to contemplate further investigations of the thickness-/morphology-dependent activities of SnO–TiO2 and other such photocatalysts, which might be affected by stoichiometric variations of the precursors. The work presented herein will pave the way for such investigations, some of which are already underway in our labs.
