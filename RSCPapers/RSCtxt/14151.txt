    , Accepted 27th January 2021First published on 17th February 2021AbstractSingle-atom catalysis is a new field that has developed rapidly in recent years and has greatly helped the development of catalytic science. We have processed a large amount of literature data through the Web of Science database. The bibliometric method was used to analyze the development trend and research hotspots over the past 10 years since the concept of single-atom catalysis was proposed in 2011. Results show that the field of single-atom catalysis is currently at a high-speed development stage. China is in a leading position in terms of comprehensive strength, with the largest number of publications and great influence. Most productive journals and institutions are ACS Catalysis and Chinese Acad. Sci. Single-atom catalysis has the most research results in the field of chemistry. In addition, the most commonly used keywords are “density functional theory”, “oxygen reduction reaction”, “electrocatalysis”, “co oxidation”, “graphene”, “heterogeneous catalysis”, “platinum”, “hydrogen evolution reaction”, which reflect the research direction of the current field. This article reviews the main research content of single-atom catalysts in order to facilitate researchers understanding the current situation in the field, and to also provide some guidance for future research.
1 Introduction
Catalysts are widely used in the fields of chemical engineering, petroleum industry, energy and environmental protection to produce chemicals, and these fields cannot leave the chemical industry. In the chemical production process, the catalytic process accounts for more than 85% of all chemical processes.1 The development of catalytic technology plays a key role in economic development, chemical production, and environmental protection. One of the main research contents of catalytic technology is the development of high-efficiency catalysts, and supported metal catalysts have excellent catalytic performance; thus they are widely used in chemical catalytic reactions. The catalytic performance of supported metal catalysts is closely related to the size of their metal active components on the support.2–5 Generally speaking, smaller the size of active metal particles, higher the metal atom utilization and the reactivity of the catalyst. At the same time, the reduction of metal particle size also facilitates the interaction between the metal and support.6,7 With the deepening of research, it has been found that sub-nano clusters have better catalytic activity and selectivity than nano-sized particles.8–12 However, because sub-nano clusters still contain multiple active centers, they are not always the optimal active centers in a particular catalytic process.13 Therefore, it is necessary to find a catalyst with a single active site to improve the performance of the catalyst. Theoretically, the size limit of the active component of the catalyst is the single atom,14,15 that is, the single-atom catalyst (SAC). This is the ideal state for supported metal catalysts. Zhang et al. first successfully prepared the single-atom Pt1/FeOx catalyst in 2011 and proposed the concept of single-atom catalysis.16 The catalyst has excellent performance in the CO oxidation reaction, which indicates that heterogeneous catalysis with SACs has become a reality. In recent years, SACs have become a rapidly developing new research area.
Unlike nanocatalysis and subnanometer catalysis, the most important structural feature of SACs is that individual atoms are dispersed on the carrier in isolation, which not only maximizes the utilization efficiency of metal atoms but also provides more uniform and clear active sites. This makes SACs more active and selective than ordinary heterogeneous catalysts. The local structure and catalytic performance are closer to homogeneous catalysts, and the structure of catalysts are stable and easy to separate. Therefore, SACs have the advantages of both homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts1 and may become a bridge between homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis.
There are also some shortcomings in SACs. As shown in Fig. 1,17 when the metal particles are at the level of a single atom, the specific surface area increases, resulting in a sharp increase in the surface free energy, and it is easy to agglomerate to form metal clusters during catalyst preparation to deactivate the catalyst. At present, the understanding of the reaction mechanism of SACs is not comprehensive enough, and further research is needed. The catalysts have low atomic loading and high cost. These are the huge challenges in preparing SACs.
 Fig. 1  The surface free energy and specific activity increase sharply with decreasing particle size.17 
Related research has found that key disciplines can become the driving force for the development of the research field and provide a clear development path for it.18 Moreover, the new research field has a higher growth rate than the old research field. Science advances are a transformative engine for profound economic changes in society. It involves a process of promoting altruism, which can spread huge benefits in society and strengthen cooperation between countries.19 This kind of international scientific collaboration plays an important role in the social construction of scientific society, the design of effective research policies and the support the production of knowledge.20
Bibliometrics is a technique for analyzing publication data sets. It mainly analyzes the title, keywords, words and references of the literature.21 Its goal is to quantitatively determine the indicators or circumstances and reveal the moment of scientific and technological discovery. It can enable society to obtain the benefits of new discoveries faster, and promote the occurrence of new discoveries, especially in important areas such as health, energy, and climate change. The data obtained through bibliometric analysis will also support the analysis of the trajectory and impact of individual researchers, teams, institutions or countries. This is conducive to the strategic decision-making of institutions and researchers.22–24 According to the characteristics of SACs, it may become a key discipline in catalysis science. Its analysis will promote the development of catalysis science.
The main part of this article is divided into two. The first part is a bibliometric analysis, and the second part is a review. The first part analyzes the research hotspots and development trends in the field of SACs in the past decade through bibliometric analysis. These statistical analyses including countries, institutions, fields and journals could help people interested in the field to quickly understand their basic information and development trends. In the second part of this paper, we review the preparation methods and characterization methods of SACs in combination with research hotspots. According to the application fields of SACs, the latest research results have been summarized. Finally, the development of SACs is prospected. It should be pointed out that we didn’t consider single-ion catalysts as SACs here, but only summarized the research progress of SACs since Zhang et al. proposed the concept of “single-atom catalysis” in 2011.
2 Data and methods
2.1 Data, sources and samples
The data in this paper are from the online database of Sci-Expanded in the Web of Science Core Collection. The data were collected on January 18, 2020.
2.2 Search measures
The subject search words consist of the following two parts: A and B. A stands for the different expressions of SACs. It includes “single-atom* catalyst*” or “single-atom* catalytic” or “single-atom* catalysis” or “single-atom* catalyze*” or “monatomic catalyst*” or “monatomic catalytic” or “monatomic catalysis” or “monatomic catalyze*” or “single atom* catalyst*” or “single atom* catalytic” or “single atom* catalysis” or “single atom* catalyze*”. B stands for some other keywords belonging to the research of SACs. It includes (“single atom* alloy” or “single-atom* dispersed” or “monatomic dispersed” or “single atom* dispersed” or “mono-atomically dispersed”) and (catalyst* or catalytic or catalysis or catalyze or catalyzer). We used the operator “or” to connect A and B when retrieving articles.
2.3 Data analysis procedures
We used Microsoft Office 2016 software to conduct statistical analysis of all relevant literature types, countries, languages, authors, institutions, keywords, number of citations, number of references, subject classification, publication names and so on in the database from 2011 to 2019. Origin 9.1 was used for related drawing work. We also analyzed the relevance of the author's keywords through Bibexcel software, and used Gephi software to draw a keyword network relationship diagram.
3 Results and discussion
Based on the statistical analysis, the SCI-Expanded network database included 1019 papers related to SACs during the 9 year period of 2011–2019. In this paper, only 805 retrieved research papers were analyzed systematically.
3.1 Publications and trend analysis
The number of related publications in a field and their changes can be a good assessment of trends in the field. Fig. 2 provides the number of publications and articles related to single-atom catalysis studies from 2011 to 2019. Chinese scientist Zhang Tao and his colleagues first prepared a Pt SAC supported on iron oxide (Pt1/FeOx) in 2011.16 Since then, the concept of “single-atom catalysis” has begun to enter people's vision. From 2011 to 2016, the number of articles grew slowly each year. The main reasons are that the concept of SACs was just born, there are few related researchers, and many advantages of SACs have not been found. Limited by the level of science and technology at that time, there were great challenges in the preparation of SACs. With the progress of research, the advantages of SACs have gradually been discovered, which has caused people to pay attention to SACs. Sun et al. found that single-atom Pt catalysts were ten times more active than the most advanced Pt/C catalysts at the time;25 Cao et al. found that the single-atom alloy catalyst has remarkable catalytic performance for heterogeneous hydrogenation, which proves the effectiveness of the single-atom alloy at the nanoscale;26 Chen et al. found that a suitable substrate can prevent the formation of clusters in SACs, which is beneficial to the preparation of SACs;27 Fei et al. combined nitrogen-doped graphene with a very small amount of Co atoms, making it the first application example of SACs in inorganic solid catalysts.28 These studies have fully demonstrated the feasibility and superior prospects of SACs, and many scientists have started relevant research. The number of publications and articles has increased rapidly since 2016. Until 2019, the number of articles published in this field each year was higher than the last year, which indicates that SACs are in rapid development.

3.2 Contributions of countries/regions
The number of documents published by a country in this field can reflect the research level of that country to a certain extent. By analyzing the addresses and affiliated units provided by the authors of the paper, the distribution of the number of published papers in different countries was obtained. It should be noted that we have unified England, Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales into the “United Kingdom (UK)”; “China” includes mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan.
According to the statistical results, 805 articles were retrieved, of which 481 (59.75%) were from a single country and 324 (40.25%) were co-authored between countries. We found that collaboration between different countries has become important in scientific research. Collaboration allows researchers to access more resources, including funding, facilities and ideas. Adams believes that these are conducive to the rapid spread of knowledge, and that institutions or countries that do not form international collaboration will gradually lose their competitiveness.29,30 A total of 44 countries or regions have published articles related to SACs. Table 1 shows the Top 10 productive countries (regions) from 2011 to 2019. Only China is a developing country, and the other nine countries (regions) are all developed countries (regions). However, China's total publications rank first in the world, accounting for 46.23% of total publications, which is 27.28% higher than the second-ranked United States. Also, China ranked first in terms of the number of single publications, the number of articles published in cooperation with other countries, the number of publications as the first author and corresponding author, accounting for 66.74%, 33.16%, 62.61% and 57.44% of the total publications, respectively. These data show that China has done a lot of research work on SACs and made a certain contribution to its development. This may be because China was the first to propose the concept of SACs and paid more attention to research in this field.

Because China and the United States have a large number of articles in this field, for convenience, the annual number of articles in China and the United States is plotted in Fig. 3a, and the annual number of articles in eight other countries, such as Australia, is plotted in Fig. 3b. According to these data, China and the United States occupy leading positions in this field, and their numbers of articles far exceed those of other countries. Except for China and the United States, few countries published articles before 2016. However, since 2016, the number of articles published in Australia and other countries has increased rapidly, which indicates that research on SACs is gradually getting attention from other countries. It is worth mentioning that research on SACs in Australia started late, and related research began in 2017 but it only took three years and their number of published articles ranked third in the world, which shows that Australian research in this field has certain potential. Australians have done a lot of research in nitrogen reduction reaction,31–34 hydrogen evolution reaction,35,36 CO2 reaction,37–40 and so on. The possible reason is that the energy shortage and the greenhouse effect are two huge problems faced by mankind today. The development of new energy and environmental protection are the common goals of mankind. The nitrogen reduction reaction and hydrogen evolution reaction help alleviate the pressure of the global energy shortage. The CO2 reaction can protect the environment by curbing the greenhouse effect. Therefore, the research of SACs in Australia mainly focuses on these two aspects. Overall, the number of articles published by countries has been increasing year by year, with 2019 being the year with the highest number of articles published. This shows that SACs are becoming more and more popular, and they will still be the hot research objects of catalytic science in the future.

3.3 Analysis of author institutions
The author units of papers published by different research institutions were analyzed by the statistical method. According to analysis, between 2011 and 2019, 805 articles were published by 627 research institutions, of which 203 (25.22%) were published by single institutions and 602 (74.78%) were published by cooperative institutions. As shown in Table 2, we selected 10 research institutions with the largest number of SACs-related publications in the world for analysis. The top ten institutions are Chinese and American research institutions, of which there are seven in China and three in the United States. This further demonstrates the leadership of the US and China in this field. Chinese Acad. Sci. ranked first with 199 articles (9.07%). Univ. Sci. & Technol. China ranked second, with 88 articles (4.01%) published. Ranked third is Univ. Chinese Acad. Sci., which has published 77 articles (3.51%). Argonne Nat’l. Lab., Arizona State Univ., and Tufts Univ. of the United States ranked 5th, 9th, and 10th, respectively, with 28 articles (1.28%), 21 articles (0.96%), and 20 articles (0.91%).

3.4 Distribution of journals and subjects
Data were collected from 805 academic journals in this field from the Web of Science online database. According to the analysis of these journals, from 2011 to 2019, the number of publications of the top ten productive journals is shown in Table 3. The journals in this field are concentrated, and the number of articles listed in the 10 journals accounts for 44.96% of the total. ACS Catalysis is the first high-yielding journal with 66 articles published, accounting for 8.20% of the total, and it is the second-highest cited times. TOP 10 journals all have high impact factors, of which eight journals have an impact factor of more than 5, and six journals have an impact factor of more than 10. Advanced Materials ranks 10th in the number of publications in all journals, but it has the highest impact factor (IF = 25.809). We also found that these journals have been cited more frequently, among which ACS Catalysis, Journal of the American Chemical Society, Nature Communications have been cited more than 2000 times. We also used the H-index to evaluate the impact of journals. H-index is one of the common evaluation tools in bibliometrics. The H-index proposed by Hirsch in 2005 is defined as follows: a scientist has an index H if H of his/her Np papers have at least H citations each, and the other Np–H papers have no more than H citations each.55 The H-index includes the number of papers and citations in the impact evaluation criteria, which can be used to accurately measure the academic achievements of the author in a certain field. The higher the H-index, the greater the academic impact. The H-index can also be used to measure the strength of institutions (universities, laboratories or journals) in specific fields.56 According to statistics, the top ten journals all have high H-indexes of over 100. This shows that these ten journals all have a certain influence. These data reflect that related research on SACs belongs to the high-end field in catalytic science, and research articles can be published in high-impact journals, and the quality and acceptance of these articles are high.

Fig. 5 shows the number of articles published in five major journals in the last five years (from 2015 to 2019). Overall, the number of articles published in these five journals is on the rise, and the number of articles published by ACS Catalysis is growing the fastest. Zhao et al. studied the stability of single metal atoms (M1) supported on nitrogen-doped graphene (N3-G) using density functional theory calculation methods.57 They found that Mo1/N3-G and Cr1/N3-G are stable materials for the electroreduction of nitrogen with high selectivity, strong competitiveness and low conductivity. Kunwar found that the load on the CeO of Pt single atom (3 wt%) under 800 °C heating will not form any clusters or 3D aggregates.58 This is because during the sintering and regeneration of the catalyst, the carrier has a certain strong interaction with the movable single atom, which helps to improve the high-temperature stability of the cerium-supported metal catalyst. Dessal et al. used operando fast X-ray absorption spectroscopy and diffuse reflectance infrared spectroscopy combined with mass spectrometry to study the dynamics of single Pt atoms in Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalysts.59 They showed the gradual aggregation–activation process of the catalytic system during heating–cooling reaction cycles and found that the increase of Pt loading or the CO/O2 concentration ratio will accelerate the clustering–reduction. This shows that the operando spectroscopies can solve the problem of SACs stability and help to assess the intrinsic activity-stability of SACs. These studies fully show that the stability of SACs is a hot issue in current research.

Based on journal classification in the journal citation report (JCR) of ISI, papers on SACs were distributed across 21 subjects in the past 9 years. As shown in Table 4, the most involved discipline in SACs-related research in the world is chemistry, and 692 papers (85.96%) have been published in this field. The second most involved subject is materials science, with 303 papers published (37.64%). According to the analysis, we found that the main uses of SACs are in the chemical industry and material preparation. There are also some areas of research in energy and batteries, mainly in the field of catalytic reactions in fuel cells, to improve the activity and tolerance of the electric catalysts used.25,60,61

We used the Bibexcel software to analyze the relevance of the author's keywords and used the Gephi software to draw a visual network relationship diagram. To make the relationship diagram simple and easy to understand, only the keywords that appear no less than 3 times were selected here. At the same time, to better show the relevance between keywords, we have used 6 SACs differently expressed keywords (“single-atom catalysts”, “single-atom catalyst”, “single-atom catalysis”, “single atom catalyst”, “single atom catalysis”, “single atom catalysts”) into “single-atom catalysts”. Fig. 7 shows the relationship between the keywords of the largest cluster. Each keyword is represented by a circle. The diameter of the circle and the size of its label represent the number of connections between the keyword and other keywords. The larger the circle, the more keywords are connected. Keywords such as “density functional theory”, “oxygen reduction reaction”, “CO oxidation”, “electrocatalysis”, “heterogeneous catalysis” occupy important positions in the research. It can be seen that density functional theory (DFT) is an important theory for studying the reaction mechanism of SACs. SACs are most commonly used in oxidation reactions, reduction reactions, electrocatalytic reactions and hydrogenation reactions. Keyword analysis results show that the research in the field of SACs is a complete system from reaction mechanism to preparation, to how to characterize to practical application. A complete research system helps to promote the comprehensive and rapid development of the field.

4 Review of research hotspots
According to the keyword statistics in the “Author keyword analysis” section, this section summarizes the preparation methods, characterization methods and applications of SACs.
4.1 Preparation method of SACs
There are many preparation methods for SACs, including atomic layer deposition, the co-precipitation method, impregnation method, high-temperature pyrolysis, etc. In this paper, the main preparation method, some researchers using this method, and the catalyst prepared by them have been used to make a tree diagram (Fig. 8) to make it clearer. Also, this article will give a brief introduction to these preparation methods.
 Fig. 8  The main preparation methods of SACs. 
Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) is a method of coating substances on the carrier layer-by-layer in the form of an atomic film. In the ALD process, the substrate is alternately exposed to different reactive precursor vapors, which react in a self-limiting manner and deposit the material layer by layer. The ALD method can precisely control the size and composition of metal nanoparticles.81 By adjusting the ALD cycle times, Sun et al.25 accurately controlled the morphology, size, density and load of Pt on graphene, and prepared the single-atom platinum catalyst supported on graphene. The preparation process is shown in Fig. 9. Compared with the traditional Pt/C catalyst, this catalyst shows higher methanol oxidation activity and excellent CO tolerance. Yan et al. prepared a single-atom Pd1/graphene catalyst using the ALD method in 2017.69 The catalyst can exhibit a selectivity of about 100% at a temperature of 50 °C and a conversion rate of 95% while exhibiting excellent resistance. Yan et al. also prepared Co1/G SACs using the ALD method in 2018.82 They used ozone to treat graphene carriers, which not only burned off metal ligands but also recreated active sites for the subsequent anchoring of another batch of Co atoms. This unique method can precisely adjust the Co atom loading from 0.4% to 2.5% without forming any Co nanoparticles or clusters. Zhang et al. successfully prepared octahedral Pt/Pd single-atom alloys catalysts by the ALD method.83 This catalyst has better catalytic activity than commercial Pt/C catalysts used in electrochemical catalytic reactions. Through X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) characterization and DFT calculations, the superior HER activity and stability are attributed to the relatively high total unoccupied density of states of 5d character and the stable metallic Pt on octahedral Pd particles. In short, ALD is an important method for preparing SACs. However, due to the high equipment cost of this method, its commercial application is limited to a certain extent.
 Fig. 9  Schematic diagram of the ALD method for preparing single-atom Pt catalysts on graphene. 
The co-precipitation method refers to a method for preparing a supported metal catalyst in which different active species are uniformly dispersed by adding a precipitating agent to a solution containing two or more metal cations, and obtaining a uniform dispersion of different active species through a precipitation reaction. This method has been widely used in catalyst preparation. Zhang et al. first prepared the single-atom Pt1/FeOx catalyst by the co-precipitation method, and was the first to put forward the concept of SACs.16 Subsequently, Zhang et al. extended the co-precipitation method to precious metal SACs such as Ir,67,84,85 Au,86,87 Pd,42 and prepared catalysts with good catalytic performance in the water–gas shift, CO oxidation, and other reactions. Wang et al. prepared an atom-dispersed Au catalyst with a loading of up to 1.0 wt% on MOFs through a room-temperature co-precipitation and conversion strategy.88 This catalyst has good catalytic activity for the hydrogenation of p-nitrophenol. No significant decrease in activity was observed for 5 cycles. The co-precipitation method is widely used in the preparation of SACs because of its simple preparation but this method has certain limitations. Its metal loading is low, and during the preparation process, some metal atoms will be buried in the carrier aggregation interface or wrapped in the carrier. These metal atoms cannot interact with the reaction molecules and participate in the reaction, reducing the performance of SACs.
The impregnation method is often used to prepare traditional heterogeneous catalysts. After the support is in contact with the aqueous solution of the metal salt, the metal salt solution enters the surface of the support or the pore structure, and the excess solution is removed, and then the catalyst is obtained by drying, calcining and activating. Zhou et al. prepared Pd/ZnO catalysts with metal loadings of 1 wt%, 0.1 wt%, and 0.01 wt% by impregnation methods, respectively.89 They found that as the content of Pd decreased, the catalyst showed better catalytic performance in the chemoselective hydrogenation of acetylene reaction. This abnormal phenomenon is due to its high single Pd active site. The active site can promote the electrostatic interaction with acetylene, but the hydrogenation of ethylene is inhibited due to the space limitation of the chemical bonding of ethylene. Zhang et al. prepared an atomically dispersed Ni catalyst on DG (A-Ni@DG) with Ni loading up to 1.24 wt% by an incipient wetness impregnation method and subsequent acid leaching method.90 A-Ni@DG has extremely high activity and stability. XAS and DFT analysis found that the superior performance of A-Ni@DG results from the unique configuration of atomic Ni in the defects, which modify the electronic structure of the trapped a Ni to minimize the reaction energy barrier for HER and OER. Yang et al. deposited three different weight percentages (0.35, 2 and 5 wt%) of Pt onto the TiN supports by an incipient wetness impregnation method.91 When the loading of Pt was 0.35 wt%, single-atom Pt was observed but Pt nanoparticles were rarely observed. This shows that the Pt catalyst obtained at a loading of 0.35 wt% is SAC. This catalyst was used for electrochemical oxygen reduction, formic acid oxidation, and methanol oxidation. It has high catalytic activity and selectivity in these reactions. Ren et al. successfully obtained a new Rh-based porous composition N polymer (Rh-POL-2BPY) with graded pores, high surface area, and high thermal stability by dipping dichloromethane in Rh2 (CO)4Cl2 solution.92 This is a highly active and superb stable catalyst for heterogeneous methanol carbonylation. The study found that POL-2BPY, apart from its heat-resisting property, acts as massive rivets to solidly immobilize the Rh species in its framework during the carbonylation process; this can make it maintain superior carbonylation stability. In short, the impregnation method is suitable for most supports but the monometallic catalyst prepared by this method usually has a lower metal loading.93 If high loads of SACs need to be prepared, other methods need to be used.
High-temperature pyrolysis is a top-down synthesis method of SACs. This method synthesizes SACs by thermal decomposition of selected precursors at an appropriate pyrolysis temperature. It can be used to prepared high loading SACs. Wu et al. used MOFs as a template to obtain the single Co atoms supported on nitrogen-doped porous carbon through the pyrolysis of bimetallic Zn/Co MOFs, with a metal loading exceeding 4 wt%.94 The catalyst exhibits excellent chemical stability during electrocatalysis and has good thermal stability at 900 °C. In this study, the introduction of Zn atoms into MOFs is a good method to effectively control the adjacent space distance between Co atoms. It is worth noting that the increase in metal loading in this study is an important breakthrough in the study of SACs. Wu et al. developed a template-assisted pyrolysis (TAP) method to prepared a Co SAC with isolated single-atom sites anchored on hollow N-doped carbon spheres (ISAS-Co/HNCS).95 It showed good ORR activity, methanol resistance and stability. Through experiments and DFT analysis, it was found that a single dispersed Co atom site significantly increased the hydrogenation activity of OH*, which was the main reason for the significant increase in the ORR activity. Cheng et al. prepared iron SACs supported on graphene by a one-pot pyrolysis method. The Fe single-atom loading was high (about 7.7 ± 1.3 wt%).96 The SACs are used in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) of polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFC). XSA studies show that the high structure and thermal stability of the FeSA-G catalyst can be attributed to the dispersion of Fe atoms in the graphene matrix coordinated with N atoms. The fuel cell with the FeSA-G cathode catalyst has high stability and high tolerance toward phosphate, which is the reason for the high-power output and stability of the fuel cell. In summary, these studies show that high-temperature pyrolysis can produce SACs with precisely controlled structures and morphologies. This unique method can be used to prepare high-performance SACs with high load.
The mass-selection soft-landing technology uses a high-frequency laser evaporation source to vaporize the metal, a mass spectrometer to precisely control the number of metal atoms and loads atoms of different sizes onto the carrier surface using soft landing. The preparation method is based on a physical deposition method. It can be used to prepare SACs. Many researchers have designed experimental and theoretical studies based on mass-separated soft-landing methods to explore the catalytic performance of metal species on the support.4,12,97–99 However, this method is not suitable for high specific surface area support and mesoporous support materials due to its high cost and low yield, so it is difficult to achieve the industrial production of SACs.93
In addition to the above methods, the successive reduction method,100 deposition–precipitation method,101,102 strong electrostatic adsorption,103,104 the galvanic-replacement method105–107 can also be used to prepare SACs.
4.2 Characterization method of SACs
To fully understand the physical and chemical properties of SACs, the atomic structure must be analyzed by characterization techniques. In recent years, the rapid development of characterization technology has promoted the progress of catalytic science. At present, advanced characterization technology can accurately characterize SACs to a certain extent and provide various useful information about catalyst properties. This will help promote further research on SACs in the future.
The characterization of supported metal catalysts by electron microscope technology is of great significance for the evaluation of supported metal catalysts. The integrated electron microscopy approach can effectively confirm the existence of a single metal atom, determine the spatial distribution of a single atom, and identify the position of a single atom relative to the surface structure of the carrier.42,108 This technology is very important for innovating and optimizing the preparation of SACs. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) is an intuitive method for determining the presence of isolated single metal atoms.109 The high-angle annular dark-field STEM (HAADF-STEM) has higher resolution and detection sensitivity, and the image contrast is extremely high. The image will not change significantly due to the thickness of the sample and the change in objective focus. The bright spots in the image can reflect real atoms or pairs of atoms. The image intensity is proportional to the square of the atomic number, so you can get information about the chemical composition of the atom.110 This characterization technique is an effective method for studying SACs. Yan et al. prepared atomically dispersed Pd on graphene by using the ALD technique.69 According to the HAADF-STEM characterization diagram (Fig. 10), at both low and high magnifications, almost all palladium atoms exist in the form of isolated atoms on the graphene carrier, and the content of Pd nanoclusters is very low, which will not affect the overall catalytic performance of the catalyst. At the same time, it can be found that individual Pd atoms are randomly distributed on the graphene carrier. This proved that Yan and his colleagues successfully prepared Pd SAC. HAADF-STEM has contributed significantly to the characterization of SACs over the past few years.28,48,69,72,74,111–113 The scanning tunnelling microscope (STM) is an instrument used to image the surface at the atomic level. Its lateral resolution is 0.1 nm and depth resolution is 0.01 nm. STM technology allows researchers to observe the conducting surfaces, the adsorption processes on these surfaces and the arrangement of single atoms on the surface of a material. It has great significance and wide application prospects for the research of SACs. For example, Therrien et al. used STM to observe the atomic-scale structure of the surface around the Pt sites during CO oxidation progress at low temperature (Fig. 11).114 The surface composed of Pt single atoms with adsorbed CO can be clearly observed.

X-Ray absorption structure (XAS) technologies applied to the characterization of SACs is mainly X-ray Absorption Near-Edge Structure (XANES). In the study of SACs, XANES is mainly used to analyze the electronic states of specific species and give information about oxidation states. Liu et al. prepared a single-atom dispersed Co–N–C catalyst.115 To determine the structure of the Co–N–C sample, a structural model based on Co(II) porphyrin was first established using DFT. They calculated the XANES spectra of the reference sample Co porphyrin to verify the effectiveness of the calculation method. The samples were then analyzed by XANES. It was found that the Co central atom is coordinated with four pyridinic N atoms, and the entire structure is deformed from the plane. Two oxygen atoms are weakly adsorbed at the Co center and perpendicular to the Co–N4 plane. This structure is completely different from the Fe–N–C structure reported by Zitolo et al.,116 which may be caused by the difference in the electronic properties of Fe and Co. This special structure has excellent activity, chemical selectivity and stability for the chemical reaction of aromatic azo compounds through the hydrogenative coupling of nitroarenes.
Infrared spectroscopy (IR) can directly monitor the interaction between adsorbed molecules and the surface of a solid metal or support.117 IR uses the interaction of a molecular probe with a solid surface to obtain information about the physical properties of the molecules of an adsorption probe. This method can also infer the properties of the active center.93 The Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometer (FTIR) is an infrared spectrometer developed based on the principle of Fourier transform of infrared light after interference. It can perform qualitative and quantitative analysis of samples. It has the advantages of a high signal-to-noise ratio, good reproducibility and fast scanning speed. At present, it is widely used in the fields of medicine and chemical industry, environmental protection, and criminal investigation. FTIR is also one of the common characterization methods of SACs. Yang et al. prepared a series of xPt–Cu/SiO2 catalysts (x is the change in the wt% of Pt in the range of 0.06–0.3 wt%) by a modified ammonia evaporation method.118 As shown in Fig. 12 (reproduced from ref. 122 with permission from the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS) and The Royal Society of Chemistry), in the FTIR spectrum display of the calcined sample, the amount of copper phyllosilicate was the highest in the 0.1Pt–Cu/SiO2 sample. The formation of copper phyllosilicate is an indicator of the strong interaction between Cu and SiO2. It can be inferred that the interaction between Cu and SiO2 is the strongest when the Pt content in the sample is 0.1 wt%. This may be one of the reasons why the 0.1Pt–Cu/SiO2 catalyst has the highest activity and selectivity. Diffuse Reflectance Infrared Fourier Transform Spectroscopy (DRIFTS) is an in situ technology developed in recent years. It can track the reaction of the catalyst,119 and then analyze the reaction mechanism. This technology combines diffuse reflection, infrared spectroscopy, and in situ infrared technology. It has the advantages of simple sample processing and does not change the original shape of the sample. Wang et al. prepared SACs with two different Au loadings (0.5 wt% and 1.0 wt%) using nanoceria as the support by the deposition–precipitation method.120 DRIFTS was used to monitor the Au structure evolution of the Au/CeO2 catalyst in the CO oxidation reaction. DRIFTS showed that the structure of Au in 1% Au/CeO2 catalyst changed from CO–Aun+ (1 ≤ n < 3) to CO–Auδ+ (0 < δ < 1). This shows that in the CO oxidation reaction, the monodisperse Au atoms of the 1% Au/CeO2 catalyst are unstable and are converted into Au clusters during the reaction. For 0.5% Au/CeO2, Aun+ has little change under steady-state conditions. This proves that the loading of Au atoms is one of the reasons for the significant difference in CO oxidation stability.
 Fig. 12  FTIR spectra of the calcined xPt–Cu/SiO2 samples.118 
Advanced characterization techniques can obtain structural information and microscopic details of SACs, and explore changes that occur during the reaction to accurately obtain the characteristics of SACs. This is conducive to promoting research on the reaction mechanism of SACs and developing new and efficient SACs.
4.3 Applications of SACs
The application of SACs in oxidation reactions mainly includes CO oxidation,46–48,50,67,86,121–123 NO oxidation,124,125 methanol oxidation,91,126–128 formaldehyde oxidation,111,129,130 methane oxidation,131–133etc. CO oxidation is a model reaction commonly used in catalytic research, and CO oxidation is of great practical value for environmental protection. Wang et al. prepared a single-atom Pt1/CeO2 catalyst.48 It was found that water has a significant promotion effect on the activity of the catalyst during the CO oxidation process. This is because water opens a new reaction channel for CO oxidation and reduces the reaction barrier. Water can contribute about 50% of the CO2 production in this reaction. CO reacts with hydroxyl groups in free water to form a carboxyl intermediate, which is then dehydrogenated to produce CO2 and H2O under the action of the hydroxyl groups in the lattice. Qiao et al. prepared Au/FeOx SAC.86 The results show that the Au/FeOx catalyst has high activity in the CO oxidation reaction and the catalyst is very stable at a high temperature of 400 °C. This is because the single Au1 atom at the Fe vacancy in FeOx nanocrystallites is positively charged, and causes a strong covalent metal–support bonding interaction between the single Au1 atom and the FeOx lattice oxygen atom, thereby fixing the Au1 atom to the support surface. This research provides new ideas and approaches for manufacturing cheap and stable SACs. Formaldehyde is a hugely harmful air pollutant, and it is necessary to study efficient catalysts for the treatment of formaldehyde. Chen et al. compared the catalytic performance of two SACs Na1/HMO and Ag1/HMO (HMO = hollandite manganese oxide) in HCHO low-temperature oxidation reaction.130 HCHO conversion (XHCHO) is shown in Fig. 13. The results of the catalysis experiments show that the catalytic activity of Na1/HMO is higher than that of Ag1/HMO in the HCHO oxidation reaction. The electronic state of surface lattice oxygen plays an important role in the catalytic performance of HCHO oxidation. Na1/HMO has more negative charges, and its surface lattice oxygen has stronger nucleophilic properties, which is why its catalytic HCHO oxidation efficiency is higher.
 Fig. 13  The relationship between XHCHO and reaction temperature (T).130 
In recent years, there has been a growing demand for low-cost photocatalysts and electrocatalysts. Because of their unique advantages, SACs have gradually become a new hot research area in photocatalytic reactions and electrocatalytic reactions. The applications of SACs in electrocatalysis include CO2 electroreduction,80,134–138 electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction,66,139 oxygen reduction reaction,140,141 electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction,28,142etc. Zhao et al. prepared Ni SAs/N–C using metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) as carriers.80 The catalyst is used for the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction, it has excellent current density and faradaic efficiency selectivity in a CO2 reduction reaction. The current density reached 10.48 mA cm−2 at −1.0 V, and the Faraday efficiency of carbon dioxide production was over 71.9% at an overpotential of 0.89 V. Zhang et al. proposed a new strategy for the traction and stabilization of isolated Pt atoms in a nitrogen-containing porous carbon matrix (Pt@PCM) for the electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction.142 The Pt@PCM synthesis process is shown in Fig. 14. The experimental results show that the isolated Pt center can maximize the efficiency of atom utilization, and can significantly improve the catalytic activity of the catalyst. In the hydrogen evolution reaction, the mass activity of the Pt@PCM catalyst is about 25 times that of the industrial Pt/C catalyst (20 weight%). Photocatalytic reactions use solar energy as an alternative energy source, which has great potential to solve the energy and environmental problems currently facing humankind. For the first time, Yang et al. prepared a single-atom (Pt, Pd, Rh, Ru) catalyst with TiO2 as the support for the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction.143 The catalytic activity of the SAC is 6–13 times higher than that of the conventional catalyst supported by TiO2. This research is the beginning of the application of SACs in photocatalysis. Di et al. added isolated single-atom Co to the Bi3O4Br atomic layer to prepare a Co–Bi3O4Br SAC for CO2 photoreduction.144 The catalyst utilizes the cooperation of ultrathin configuration and isolated single-atom Co to make it have good photocatalytic activity for the reduction of CO2 to CO. The reaction rate is as high as 107.1 μmol g−1 h−1, which is about 4 times and 32 times higher than the Bi3O4Br atomic layer and the bulk Bi3O4Br.
 Fig. 14  Schematic diagram of Pt@PCM synthesis process.142 
The hydrogenation reaction mainly includes 1,3-butadiene hydrogenation reaction,46,69,145 unsaturated aldehydes hydrogenation reaction,146,147 nitroarenes hydrocarbon hydrogenation reaction,41,115,148 acetylene hydrogenation reaction43,45,65,72,149,150 and the like. Nitroarenes hydrogenation is an important part of the manufacture of fine chemicals such as pesticides, drugs and dyes. Li et al. prepared Co SAC supported on nitrogen-doped ultrathin carbon nanosheets.151 The preparation process of CoSAs/NCNS is shown in Fig. 15. The catalyst is an excellent SAC for the selective transfer hydrogenation of nitroaromatics to amines using formic acid as a hydrogen donor. It was found that CoSAs/NCNS has an ultrathin mesoporous structure, which facilitates mass transfer to obtain active Co single atoms. Under similar reaction conditions, the catalytic activity of CoSAs/NCNS is 20 times that of the transition metal nanoparticles reported in related literature. Ethylene is an important chemical for the production of polyethylene and is usually obtained by cracking petroleum hydrocarbons. A small amount of acetylene is produced as a by-product during the production of ethylene. Because acetylene can adversely affect the polymerization of ethylene, the selective hydrogenation of acetylene to ethylene has important industrial significance. Zhou et al. prepared Pd SACs on N-doped graphene for the hydrogenation of acetylene to ethylene.150 Under photothermal heating (ultraviolet and visible-light irradiation from xenon lamps), when an excess of C2H4 is present, the Pd1/N-graphene catalyst shows excellent activity and selectivity for the hydrogenation reaction of C2H2 and H2, achieving 99% acetylene conversion and 93.5% ethylene selectivity (125 °C). The results show that this remarkable catalytic performance is due to the high concentration of Pd active sites and the weak adsorption energy of ethylene on isolated Pd atoms, which can prevent the hydrogenation of C2H4 to C2H6. The study for the first time confirmed the feasibility of the photothermal hydrogenation of acetylene to ethylene and provided a theoretical basis for the development of other photothermal catalysts.
 Fig. 15  Schematic illustration of preparing CoSAs/NCNS (purple represents a cobalt atom, blue represents nitrogen atoms, grey represents carbon atoms).151 
SACs also showed excellent catalytic performance in other reactions, including the Ullmann reaction,152 fine chemical synthesis,153 the fuel cell,60,61,73 water gas shift reaction,84,154etc. For example, in the selective non-oxidative ethanol dehydrogenation reaction, the NiCu single-atom alloy supported on SiO2 catalyzed the formation of acetaldehyde and hydrogen products from ethanol by promoting the activation of Ce–H bonds.155 The SiO2 support in this catalyst facilitated the cleavage of the O–H bond of ethanol to form an ethoxy intermediate. The presence of Ni atoms on the Cu surface significantly reduces the barrier for C–H bond activation, which is one of the reasons for the high catalytic activity of the catalyst. In the hydroformylation reaction, Rh/CoO SAC has significant activity and selectivity for the hydroformylation of propylene.71 The TOF number of 0.2% Rh/CoO reached 2065 h−1, which is 1 time, 1.4 times and 5.2 times of 1.0% Rh/CoO and 4.8% Rh/CoO, respectively; also, the selectivity of 0.2% Rh/CoO to butyraldehyde was as high as 94.4%. These studies show that SACs have good performance in many fields and have great development prospects.
5 Conclusion
Herein, we have studied and analyzed the publication of SACs over the past 10 years. The results show that since the concept of SAC was proposed in 2011, SACs have quickly become a hot research area in catalytic science, which has attracted the widespread attention of more and more researchers. However, the research of SACs still faces many challenges. (1) The metal atomic loading of SACs is usually low, and a synthesis method with high load, easy operation and low cost needs to be found. (2) Single atoms have extremely high surface energy, which makes it easy for single atoms to aggregate on the support to form nanoclusters, which is an important factor affecting the stability of SACs. (3) The specific reaction mechanism of SACs is not clear, and further research is needed. (4) Reasonable construction of active sites of SACs. In the future, the key to the research of SACs includes the in-depth study and analysis of the atomic-level catalytic reaction mechanism from the perspective of kinetics and thermodynamics, the development of new preparation methods of SACs with reasonable cost and high atomic loading, the reasonable construction of active sites of SACs to strengthen metal–support interaction and prevent atom agglomeration.
In short, for a new important field that is emerging and rapidly developing, it is very necessary to study its current situation and future development trends. This research helps researchers understand the current status and characteristics of SACs worldwide, and enables researchers to have a broader understanding of the current development trends, and to accordingly establish further research directions. However, in the course of the research, we found that this study has some limitations that need to be addressed in future work: (1) as SACs appeared for a short time, only 10 years from 2011 to the present, the overall sample size of this article is small and we only analyzed 805 research papers. This result can only represent the development trend of SACs in a short period of time, and cannot represent the long-term development trend. (2) The paper data in the database will be continuously updated, such as with newly published papers, and the number of citations of papers will change, etc. Therefore, this research can only represent the results within the specified time period, and cannot represent the latest results. (3) Due to space limitations, the review part of this article cannot fully demonstrate the current status of SACs research. To determine the future research direction, in addition to the content described in this article, it is necessary to conduct a more comprehensive and detailed literature review of the current research topics and research methods of SACs.
