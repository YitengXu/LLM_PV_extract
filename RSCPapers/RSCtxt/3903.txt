    , Accepted 15th July 2015First published on 27th July 2015AbstractThe inverted perovskite solar cell fabricated using a two-step method exhibited the highest FF of 0.85 and good efficiency of 18% based on CH3NH3PbI3. A small amount of H2O was added into PbI2/DMF to make a homogenous precursor solution. A high quality PbI2 film with full coverage was formed on a PEDOT:PSS surface by spin coating of the homogeneous PbI2 precursor solution. The perovskite film fabricated from the high quality PbI2 film is highly pure, smooth and very dense even without any pinhole. The champion cell achieves a remarkable fill factor (FF) of 0.85, which is the highest value reported in perovskite solar cells. The FF value is also very reproducible with less than 10% deviation for 50 cells. The cell exhibits no current hysteresis and is stable under both dark and illumination conditions in dry and inert atmospheres. The results not only provide a strategy to fabricate high efficiency inverted perovskite solar cells but also reveal how the water additive in the PbI2/DMF solution may affect the properties of PbI2 and therefore the perovskite film prepared using the two-step method and the overall photovoltaic performance of the corresponding inverted solar cell.
Photovoltaic devices which convert solar energy into electricity are one of the important technologies for renewable energy. Photovoltaic cells using perovskite as a photo absorber and carrier transporter is a burgeoning research, since perovskite based solar cells not only have high power conversion efficiency1–6 but also can be fabricated by a solution process using cheap materials.7–12 The first perovskite solar cell was demonstrated by Miyasaka et al.,13 who used lead halide perovskite as the light absorber/sensitizer in a mesoscopic dye-sensitized solar cell. A later study showed that perovskite materials have bipolar transport properties and therefore can readily serve as the intrinsic absorption layer in an inverted p–i–n device.14 Compared to the mesoscopic perovskite solar cell which often requires high-temperature (above 450 °C) treatment the inverted perovskite solar cell with an architecture similar to the planar heterojunction organic photovoltaics has the advantage of a low temperature (<100 °C) solution process, and therefore can be adopted in roll-to-roll production and flexible devices. In an inverted device layout, the perovskite film was deposited on top of the hole transporter which is generally an organic material such as PEDOT:PSS. It is very difficult to fabricate perovskite films with large crystalline domains (>1 μm) and full surface coverage on the smooth surface of an organic compound via a simple (spin-coating) solution process. Nevertheless, the morphology of perovskite is one of the most important factors for device performance.15 One of the strategies to fabricate highly crystalline and continuous perovskite films is by using an additive.
The concept of additive was widely used in the bulk-heterojunction organic solar cells to manipulate the morphology of the active layer to enhance the photovoltaic performance of the devices.16–20 The function of the additive is to reduce the aggregation of n-type fullerene and enhance the crystallinity of the self-organized p-type polymer by its selective solubility towards one component to form an optimal morphology for facile charge separation and carrier transport. The concept of additive has also been used in perovskite solar cells to improve the morphology of perovskite films to increase the device efficiency. Im et al.21 had added H2O or HBr(aq) in a CH3NH3PbBr3/DMF precursor solution to grow a highly dense perovskite film on a mesoporous TiO2 film. Jen et al.22,23 used 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) as an additive in the precursor solution to reduce the crystallization rate of perovskite upon spin coating. They believed that the bidentate halogenated additives can temporarily chelate with Pb+2 to increase the solubility of perovskite during the crystal growth to form a smooth and continuous film on the flat surface. NH4Cl,24 g-butyrolactone (GBL),25 1-chloronaphthalene (CN)26 and aminovaleric acid27 have been used as additives in the CH3NH3PbI3 precursor solution to improve the quality of the spin coated film by reducing the crystallization rate of perovskite.
Not only adding an additive but also the post treatment of the film can increase the quality of the perovskite film. Recently Yang et al.28 showed that moisture can assist the grain growth of the perovskite film to dramatically increase the carrier mobility and charge carrier lifetime. Moisture was known to be an important factor in perovskite solar cell technology with advantages5,28,29 as well as disadvantages.30 It seems that water can decompose the structure of ionic perovskite into PbI2 and MAI, but it can also mend the interface (by dissolution and recrystallization) of the grains to form a continuous smooth film. Combining the concept of additive and the function of water, instead of manipulating the nucleation and growth of the perovskite film by varying the compositions of the precursor solution in one-step method,12,15,31–33 we will apply water as an additive in the two-step method34,35 we used for preparing the perovskite film. Our novel approach is to make a high quality and full coverage PbI2 film on PEDOT:PSS by adding a controllable amount of water in PbI2/DMF to make a concentrated, homogeneous precursor solution. After adding MAI, an extremely smooth, highly crystalline, adhesive and continuous perovskite film was made. The resulting inverted solar cell achieves the highest efficiency of ca. 18% with a remarkably high fill factor of 85% which is the highest value amongst all perovskite solar cells.
The preparation steps for the perovskite film are the same as that reported previously.10 The PbI2 film was spin-coated on PEDOT:PSS deposited ITO and then MAI was added to form perovskite. The detailed device fabrication procedures are described in the Experimental section. PEDOT:PSS is an excellent hole transporting material. Nevertheless, to obtain a crystal homogeneous over a smooth organic surface such as the PEDOT:PSS film via a simple solution process (such as spin-coating) is not easy for an ionic material (such as perovskite) which crystallizes very fast.12,36–38 On the other hand, compared to perovskite, PbI2 is less polar therefore can form a continuous film on the PEDOT:PSS surface easily. That is the reason why the two-step spin coating method is an appropriate way to fabricate a perovskite film when PEDOT:PSS is used as a hole transport layer in the inverted device. DMF (dimethylformamide) is a general solvent for PbI2, we found that PbI2 has low solubility in dried DMF, and a colloid suspension instead of a homogeneous solution was formed when 0.37 g of PbI2 was dissolved in 1 mL DMF (0.80 M, a concentration to obtain the PbI2 film with appropriate thickness by spin coating) and heated at 80 °C for 10 min. Surprisingly, when a small amount (0.5–4 vol% vs. DMF) of H2O was added in PbI2/DMF, the solution became homogeneous as displayed in Fig. 1. H2O is miscible with DMF, the polarity, dielectric constant and solubility parameter39 of DMF changed when H2O was added. PbI2 is also dissolved sparingly in H2O and the solubility parameter of the DMF/H2O mixture may be close to that of PbI2, therefore PbI2 was totally dissolved in the mixed solvent.
 Fig. 1  The photographs of PbI2/DMF solutions containing various amounts of H2O additive (the H2O content is volume ratio vs. DMF). 
The SEM images of PbI2 films (PbI2-X represents the films prepared from a PbI2/DMF solution with X wt% (vs. DMF) of water) deposited on PEDOT:PSS by spin coating are illustrated in Fig. 2. It was shown that the content of H2O in the precursor solution has a large impact on the morphology of PbI2 films. Full coverage, continuous PbI2 films (PbI2-2 and PbI2-3) were obtained only when the precursor solution contains 2–3 wt% H2O. More or less water content in the precursor solution results in poorer morphology. A non-continuous film with large voids and rough surface was observed when the precursor solution contains no H2O. The PbI2-2 film prepared from PbI2/DMF containing 2 wt% water is the smoothest film composed of the largest grains. High quality PbI2 films were formed because the precursor solutions are very homogeneous. Moreover, PEDOT:PSS is hydrophilic; the PbI2/DMF + H2O solution has good adhesion on the PEDOT:PSS film. The precursor solution can disperse evenly on the surface of the PEDOT:PSS film, and improve the surface coverage of the PbI2 film after spinning by matching the interfacial energy.

The crystallinity of PbI2 films prepared using precursor solutions containing various amounts of water is not the same. GIXRD patterns (from the line scans along the qz (2θ) direction) of PbI2 films are displayed in Fig. 3 and the original data are shown in Fig. S1 of the ESI.† The diffraction peaks at 2θ of 12.3, 25.6 and 38.2° indicated clearly that all PbI2 films are crystalline with the same d-spacing. The crystallinity of the PbI2 film increases when H2O was added in the precursor solution but water molecules did not insert into the layer spacing of the PbI2 lattice. The crystallinity and crystalline domain of the films (estimated from the intensity and peak-width of the (001) diffraction peak and listed in Table S1, ESI†) are also correlated with the film morphology: a smoother film has higher crystallinity and larger crystalline domains. Nevertheless, except for the PbI2-0 film, the variation in crystallinity and crystalline domain size is not significant. Interestingly, the pole figures (displayed in the inset of Fig. 3) of the (001) diffraction peak constructed from the 2D diffraction patterns clearly reveal that the PbI2 film on PEDOT:PSS has a preferred orientation with its (001) crystal plane parallel to the substrate because PbI2 has a hexagonal layered structure. The strong and narrow peak width (ca. 20 degree) along the χ axis confirmed that PbI2-2 and PbI2-3 films are highly oriented on the PEDOT:PSS surface even when the film was prepared by spin coating at room temperature. The increased coverage and smoothness of the PbI2 film assisted with the H2O additive suggests that water can induce homogenous nucleation by modifying the PbI2/PEDOT:PSS interfacial energy. Therefore the PbI2 crystal can grow evenly and has the best contact with the PEDOT:PSS surface.

CH3NH3PbI3 films were fabricated by spin coating of MAI/isopropanol (IPA) solutions with various concentrations at a fixed spin program of 2000 rpm for 30 seconds. The best performance perovskite film was obtained when 30 μL, 5% MAI/IPA was used for reacting with PbI2 films. In the two-step spin coating method, the quality of the perovskite film may depend on the morphology and crystallinity of the starting PbI2 film. SEM surface images of perovskite films (Prov-X, Prov-X indicate the film prepared from the PbI2-X film) are displayed in Fig. 4. As expected the morphology of perovskite films was affected significantly by their starting PbI2 films. Films (Prov-2–Prov-3) prepared from good quality PbI2 films (PbI2-2 and PbI2-3) are very smooth and densely packed. There is almost no hole or crevice between the grains. This is the advantage of preparing perovskite films using a two-step (spin-coating) method because making a high quality PbI2 film is easier than fabricating a good perovskite film. The morphology of the perovskite film is a determining parameter of the photovoltaic performance of the corresponding solar cell, which will be discussed more in the later paragraphs.

The GIXRD patterns of perovskite films illustrated in Fig. 5 show seven characteristic peaks at 2θ from 10 to 35°, which confirmed that only the tetragonal perovskite structure13,40,41 was formed for all films. This is another advantage of fabricating perovskite films using a two-step method since highly pure perovskite can be obtained by controlling the volume and concentration of the MAI/IPA solution. Surprisingly, the variation in the crystallinity for perovskite films is different from their ancestor PbI2 films. The crystallinity (peak intensity) of all perovskite films is similar and only Prov-0 and Prov-4 have slightly lower crystallinity than the others. Nevertheless, Prov-2 and Pero-0 films have the largest and smallest crystalline domain size, respectively, consistent with the surface morphology displayed in Fig. 4.

After spin coating a PCBM film, solvent annealing of the PCBM acceptor layer and employing a Ca/Al electrode using thermal evaporation, the inverted perovskite cell with ITO/PEDOT:PSS/perovskite/PCBM/Ca/Al architecture42 was fabricated. The photovoltaic parameters of the highest efficiency cells of D-X (D-X means the solar cell based on the Prov-X film) are summarized in Table 1 and the corresponding I–V curves are displayed in Fig. S2, ESI.† We fabricated 20 cells under each preparation condition (listed in Table 1) and the statistical analysis of the efficiency is illustrated in Fig. S3, ESI.† Data in Table 1 reveal that the efficiency of perovskite solar cells depends on the quality of the starting PbI2 film which is very sensitive to the water content in its precursor solution. The photovoltaic performance of the device based on a Prov-0 film (film prepared without water additive) is very poor. Small amount (0.5 wt%) of water additive in the PbI2 precursor solution can improve significantly all the photovoltaic parameters of the resulting cells and the overall efficiency increases from 0.0063% to 7.4%. A cell exhibiting the highest efficiency of 18% with a remarkable FF of 0.85 was obtained when a Prov-2 film was applied as a light absorber. Upon further increasing the amount of water additive in the PbI2 precursor solution, the efficiency of the corresponding cell decreases again. We reported previously20 that the device with efficiency up to 16% was obtained based on similar cell fabrication procedures without knowing the exact water content in the PbI2/DMF precursor solution. The results disclose that to obtain high efficiency and reproducible perovskite solar cell, the materials, fabrication steps and environment should be precisely controlled. At the same time it also indicated that perovskite cells with higher efficiency can be expected in the future as more properties of the components in the cell are known.

The IPCE and I–V curves for the champion cell (D-2 with η of 18%) are displayed in Fig. 6. The IPCE curve shows a strong spectral response in the range from 350 nm to 750 nm with an efficiency close to 90% at a wavelength of 566 nm. The integrated current density (19.8 mA cm−2) from the IPCE curve shows ca. 4% mismatch compared to the Jsc (20.6 mA cm−2) obtained from the I–V curve. A slight mismatch of the Jsc from the I–V curves and calculated from IPCE data is a general phenomenon in solar cells since the measuring bases are not totally the same and there exist a measuring uncertainty of the current density. It is notable that the champion cell has an extremely high FF of 0.85, the highest value amongst all perovskite solar cells reported in the literature.43 We believe that high quality (especially good morphology) of the absorber is the key parameter for achieving such high FF for the inverted perovskite solar cells. It was known that the series resistance (RS) of the device expresses the integral conductivity of the device directly related to its internal carrier mobility whereas the shunt resistance (RSH) refers to the loss of photocurrent through carrier recombination within the device, particularly at the interfaces of each layer. Shunt resistance is typically due to the manufacturing defects, rather than poor solar cell design. RS and RSH calculated from the I–V curves of the corresponding devices are also listed in Table 1. The champion cell (D-2) reported in this article has a series resistance as low as 1.54 Ω cm2 and extremely high RSH of 87 × 103 Ω cm2. Small Rs suggests that the interphase contact is good and the conductivity of every layer of the device is high. A high shunt resistance indicates that the power loss in the solar cell through an alternate current path is very small, resulting in high FF. In order to check the reproducibility of the high FF, 50 devices (during one month) were fabricated and the FF was recorded. The histogram of the FF based on 50 devices (displayed in Fig. S4, ESI†) reveals that the high FF is a general result for the inverted devices based on a perovskite film prepared from a PbI2 film with 2 wt% H2O in its precursor solution.
 Fig. 6  (a) I–V curve and (b) EQE curve (the integrated current from the EQE curve is also displayed) of the champion cell reported in this article. 
To gain more in-depth understanding of the origin of the high FF of the champion cell, the information regarding the layer stacking was investigated. The SEM cross section images of the ITO/PEDOT:PSS/Prov-2 film are shown in Fig. 7 (the image of the Prov-0 film is also displayed in Fig. 7 for comparison). The preparation conditions of these perovskite films were identical to the conditions used for device fabrication. Prov-0 (obtained from the PbI2 film prepared without H2O additive) is composed of large numbers of small crystallites (size 50–500 nm) with lots of voids. On the other hand, Prov-2 is a very dense film with large grains. No pinhole was observed even at a magnification of 100000. The thickness of the films estimated from the cross-section images for Prov-0 and Prov-2 is 550 and 410 nm, respectively. The Prov-2 film has a similar absorption intensity (unpublished result) but is thinner compared to the Prov-0 film, consistent with the SEM images which reveal that Prov-2 is a denser film. The grain size of Prov-2 estimated from the cross section image is 0.5–1.0 μm in width, which is close to that calculated from the surface morphology. Notably the length of the grains is equal to the thickness of the film and the film uniformity expands to several tens micrometer as displayed in Fig. 7(c). The structure of the film cross-section provides a good reason to explain why the cell with a rather thick (410 nm) perovskite film can achieve such high FF. It seems that the morphology rather than the crystallinity of the perovskite film is a key parameter for the photovoltaic performance of the corresponding inverted perovskite solar cells, consistent with the conclusion made by Snaith et al.12 Furthermore, Xiao et al.44 also used a two-step method to prepare perovskite films and heated the films to trigger the inter-diffusion between PbI2 and MAI. The resulting inverted cell exhibited an efficiency of 15.4% and the maximum grain size of the perovskite film was around 260 nm.45 The efficiency of the cell and the grain size of the perovskite absorber reported by Xiao et al.44 are lower than those of our device. It is probably because the water content in the PbI2 precursor solution was not well controlled (DMF may absorb water from the ambient atmosphere if it is not well-maintained) in Xiao's work.44 Therefore, a poorer quality PbI2 film was formed in the first step although the paper did not discuss the morphology of the PbI2 film. Xiao et al.45 later used solvent (DMF) annealing to improve the quality of the perovskite film prepared by an inter-diffusion method. The surface morphology and crystallite size of the solvent annealed perovskite film is improved nevertheless the cross-section image revealed that the film was composed of a large number of crystallites with the size smaller than the thickness of the film. A high inter-particle contact resistance exists in the film therefore the efficiency of their best device is only 15.6% with a FF of ca. 80%. The higher Voc and FF of the device reported in this paper is because the perovskite film fabricated by us has better quality compared to what we reported20 before and most perovskite films reported in the literature.14,44,45

It was known that perovskite solar cells may show photocurrent hysteresis at certain voltage scanning rates (or sweep delay times) or scan directions. The photocurrent hysteresis may be due to either the charge traps of the low quality perovskite film, an unbalanced electron and hole transport rate or the defect in the interphase.46,47 Therefore the efficiency reported for a device with photocurrent hysteresis may not truly represent the performance of the device. We found that a high efficiency cell with inverted architecture generally shows no current hysteresis. The I–V curves (displayed in Fig. S5, ESI†) of the D-2 (D-X device means the device based on a Prov-X film) cell scanned at two different directions and scan rates (0.01–0.5 V s−1) show no hysteresis. The results also suggested that the hysteresis in photocurrent is more likely due to the defects on the perovskite film and the interfaces of PEDOT:PSS/perovskite/PCBM, which can be eliminated partly by using a high quality perovskite film prepared by a novel approach. Two-step spin-coating is a preeminent method to prepare highly crystalline and continuous perovskite films. In the two-step method, the quality of the MAPbI3 film depends on the film quality of PbI2. Preparing a highly dense and smooth PbI2 film on the surface of PEDOT:PSS is easier compared to depositing a perovskite film because PbI2 is less ionic than MAPbI3. A high quality PbI2 film can be prepared by simply adding a small amount of water in the precursor solution.
In the development of perovskite solar cells, high efficiency devices sometimes show poor long-term stability.5 The high efficiency device reported in this paper shows very good long term stability when stored in the glove box as illustrated in Fig. 8. The PCE of the device decreases less than 10% after being stored for 40 days under dark conditions in a glove box. Furthermore we also test the stability of the device under illumination with AM 1.5 G (100 mW cm−2) light. The efficiency decreases ca. 4% gradually in the first 4 hours and then stabilizes up to 6 hours (the test time, see Fig. S6, ESI†). Another issue generally of concern for the perovskite solar cell community is the reproducibility of the photovoltaic performance for the cells fabricated under almost same conditions, because the fast crystallization of the perovskite absorber is difficult to control. The statistical data of the efficiency based on 20 cells fabricated for each condition (listed in Table 1) shown in Fig. S3, ESI† revealed that the inverted perovskite cells fabricated with the method reported is this paper are quite reproducible. More detailed analysis was done for the 20 devices (D-2) fabricated with 2 wt% H2O in a PbI2/DMF precursor solution (the condition for fabricating a cell with the highest efficiency). The histograms and detailed statistical analysis using a quartile deviation method48 of the photovoltaic parameters of D-2 cells are illustrated in Fig. S7 and Table S2 (ESI†), respectively. From the statistical point of view, none of the data displayed in Table S2 (ESI†) is an outlier (outlier means non-reasonable datum). In other words, the photovoltaic data of the 20 devices suggested that the devices are reproducible using the fabrication method reported in this paper.

The efficiency measurement containing uncertainty should be analyzed in order to show the confidence of the data reported. The uncertainty (error) of a measurement comes from the random errors and systematic errors. The random errors of the photovoltaic parameters are illustrated in Table S3, ESI† and the detailed procedures for determining random errors can be found in the Experimental section. The most significant systematic errors (their determination is very time-consuming since they involve so many parameters compared to the general chemical analysis) of the measuring systems and the resulting photovoltaic parameters are listed in Tables S4 and S5, ESI.† If the standard uncertainty (with the coverage factor (k) = 1) or expanded uncertainty (with the coverage factor (k) = 2) was concerned, the data listed in Table S2 (ESI†) are all within the experimental uncertainty.
In conclusion, we report a strategy to synthesize high quality perovskite films under an ambient atmosphere at low temperature using a two-step method. A few percent of the most environmentally friendly chemical (H2O) was added into PbI2/DMF to make a homogeneous solution. The PbI2 film spin coated on PEDOT:PSS coated ITO (from the homogeneous precursor solution) is highly smooth, crystalline and oriented with its (001) plane parallel to the surface of the substrate. The perovskite film fabricated from the high quality PbI2 film is highly pure and dense even without any pinhole. The champion inverted cell based on a high quality perovskite film achieves a power conversion efficiency of ca. 18% with a remarkable high FF of 0.85 which is the highest value amongst perovskite solar cells. The FF value is also very reproducible: less than 10% deviation for 50 cells. The cell exhibits no current hysteresis and is stable under dark and illumination conditions in dry and inert atmospheres. The results provide a new way to fabricate highly crystalline and dense perovskite films with full coverage on a very smooth PEDOT:PSS surface. This article also reveals how the water additive in the PbI2/DMF precursor solution can affect the surface coverage of PbI2 and perovskite films (prepared by a two-step method) on PEDOT:PSS and the photovoltaic performance of the corresponding inverted solar cell.
Experimental
Materials and physicochemical studies
An aqueous dispersion of PEDOT:PSS (1.3–1.7 wt%, from H.C. Stark Baytron P AI 4083) was obtained from Heraeus Co. PC71BM (99.5%) was purchased from Solenne B. V., Netherlands. PbI2 (99.999%) was purchased from Aldrich Co. All the above materials were used as received. ITO-covered glass substrates purchased from Merck Co. were photolithographically patterned in our laboratory with HCl(aq). CH3NH3I (MAI) was synthesized by the same method published in the literature.49 The thickness of the films was measured using a depth-profile meter (Veeco Dektak 150, USA). Five lines on the 1.0 cm × 1.0 cm film were made by carefully scratching with a tip and the average height between the hills and valleys is used to represent the film thickness. GIXRD data were collected in the 2θ range 5–50° on a Bruker powder diffractometer (D8 Discover) using Cu Kα1 radiation equipped with a 2D detector. The scanning electron micrograph (SEM) was obtained using a Hitachi S-800 microscope at 15 kV. Samples (surface and cross-section of the film on substrates) for SEM imaging were mounted on a metal stub with a piece of conducting tape then coated with a thin layer of gold film to avoid charging.
Device fabrication
PEDOT:PSS was spin-coated on a heat pretreated patterned ITO at 5000 rpm for 50 s and then annealed at 100 °C for 15 min. The PbI2/DMF precursor solutions with the H2O additive were prepared by first dissolving PbI2 in DMF, then adding various amount of H2O in the solution and stirring overnight. For depositing a perovskite layer, first a layer of PbI2 was spin-coated on top of a PEDOT:PSS coated ITO substrate from 0.8 M precursor solution (with or without H2O additive). Before PbI2 was dried totally, CH3NH3I was spin-coated on top of the PbI2 film from an isopropanol solution with various concentrations at spin rates of 2000 rpm to form a perovskite film. Specifically, a perovskite film with the best photovoltaic performance was fabricated by using 50 mg mL−1 CH3NH3I/IPA solution at a spin rate and time of 2000 rpm and 30 s. The acceptor layer was prepared by spin coating (1000 rpm, 30 s) 2 wt% PC71BM in chlorobenzene onto the surface of the perovskite film. The PC71BM film was solvent annealed by covering the film with a Petri dish for 24 hours. The trace amount of solvent (chlorobenzene) in the film will continuously infiltrate PCBM to form a close contact with the perovskite film underneath. Solvent annealing of the PC71BM layer is very important when the surface of the perovskite film is rather rough. However it has less effect when the quality (flat and continuous) of the perovskite film is good as the high-efficiency cell reported in this study. All the fabrication procedures were carried in an ambient atmosphere at low temperature (≤100 °C). Finally, the PEDOT:PSS/perovskite/PC71BM film was transferred to a vacuum chamber for coating the Ca/Al (20 nm/100 nm) electrode.
Photovoltaic performance measurement
The sun simulator used in this study is a 3A (AAA) Wacom solar simulator (KXL-500F, Wacom, Japan). The light intensity of the simulator was calibrated using a KG-5 Si diode before each measurement. The Si diode was calibrated from time to time using a Secondary-Reference Si-cell (for example, the current of the Secondary- Reference single crystal Si-cell with a KG-2 filter (2.0 cm × 2.0 cm in size) under 1 Sun should be 70.6 mA) which was calibrated by TERTEC Org., Taiwan (following the IEC 60904). The area of the test cell was defined by a home-made mask. The area (defined with the close polyline to a polygon) of the mask was measured using a microscope (PS-930 NG, Just Technology Corp., Taiwan) having an accuracy of 0.001 cm. Measurements were performed repeatedly 10 times to obtain the average value of the mask area. A Keithley 4200 source measuring unit was used to apply voltage and measure current. The efficiency of the cell was calculated by (Pmax)/(L × A) (Pmax is the maximum power of the I–V curve and L is the intensity of the simulated light, A is the area of mask on the test cell). FF was calculated by (Pmax)/(Jsc × Voc). Jsc is equal to Isc divided by the area of test cell (defined by the mask).
IPCE of the perovskite solar cell was measured using an IPCE measuring system (QE-R3011, Enlitech Inc., Taiwan) equipped with a Xe lamp as the light source, and the spectral resolution of the monochromator is 1 nm. The wavelength interval we used for measuring the IPCE curve is 10 nm. The intensity of the incident light from the monochromator was calibrated using a Si-reference cell installed inside QE-R3011. The calibration of the light intensity was done before each IPCE measurement. The beam size of the incident light is smaller than the area of the device (without mask) for the correct measurements. The Si-reference cell was calibrated from time to time using a Secondary-Reference Si-cell (the same as that used to calibrate the Sun simulator). The temperature of the lab for the photovoltaic performance measurements is 25 ± 5 °C but the temperature of the test cell is stable up to ±2 °C under illumination of light within 30 minutes.
For understanding the uncertainty of the efficiency for the high performance inverted perovskite solar cells, the random and systematic errors (uncertainties) were also analyzed. The uncertainty of a measurement comes from the random errors and systematic errors. To present a random error for the photovoltaic performance measurements, the photovoltaic parameters of a stable reference diode were repeatedly measured 10 times. It is very time-consuming to obtain the systematic error of the photovoltaic parameters since it involves so many parameters. However the uncertainty data should be measured after the measuring system is set and the measuring system calibrated from time to time. The systematic error involved Instrument errors, Method errors and Personal errors which were determined by many sophisticated procedures. Some most important (big) errors are displayed in Table S4 and the origins of the errors are explained below the table. Finally the errors (expressed as standard uncertainty with the coverage factor (k) = 1 and expanded uncertainty with the coverage factor (k) = 2) of the photovoltaic parameters propagated from the corresponding items of the measuring errors were calculated.
