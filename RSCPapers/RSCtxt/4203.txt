    , Accepted 12th July 2017First published on 12th July 2017AbstractNon-flammable and low-cost aqueous batteries operating on “M+/N+-dual shuttles” (AMIB) offer great opportunities in large-scale utility grid applications. Here, for the first time, we demonstrate a series of high-voltage AMIB (>1.23 V) based on open-framework copper hexacyanoferrates (CuHCFs) as cathode materials, and TiP2O7 & NaTi2(PO4)3 as anode materials. Among them, CuHCF/NaTi2(PO4)3 possesses high power density as an ultra-capacitor (3006 W kg−1), but with a higher energy density (56 W h kg−1). Through multiple characterization techniques combined with ab initio calculations, the intercalation chemistry of alkali cations in CuHCF is revealed. With increasing ionic size, the most stable interstitial site changes from the face-centered site (24d) to the body-centered site (8c). The intercalation voltage for the alkali cations follows the order: K+ > Na+ > Li+. Meanwhile, the ion-selectivity among them follows the same order as the intercalation voltage, which accounts for the higher voltage outputs of AMIB in contrast to aqueous batteries operating on one shuttle.
1 Introduction
Integration of sustainable and renewable energy such as solar and wind power into power grids is critical to meet the world's growing demand for energy and to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases caused by overusing fossil fuels. Rechargeable aqueous metal-ion batteries (RAMB) based on metal-ion intercalation chemistry are perfect devices for grid-scale energy storage because of their good safety, low cost, and eco-friendliness.1–11 Among them, RAMB with alkali cations (Li+, Na+ and K+) as electrochemical shuttles have drawn a great deal of attention since the past two decades.1,3,12,13 Due to the higher abundance of sodium or potassium than lithium, RAMB with Na+ or K+ shuttles are more competitive for grid-scale energy storage. However, as Na+ (1.02 Å) and K+ (1.38 Å) have larger radii than Li+ (0.76 Å), only a few compounds that can reversibly (de)intercalate Na+ or K+ work well in aqueous media.1,3 As a result, the known RAMB with Na+ or K+ shuttles are quite limited, and most of them suffer from the problem of low energy density owing to their low voltage output (<1.2 V).1,3 Currently, substantial efforts have been made to seek viable RAMB with high voltage for grid-scale energy storage around the world.
Recently, our group has explored a family of high-voltage RAMB (>1.2 V) based on a new concept of dual shuttle ions, the so-called aqueous metal-ion batteries (AMIB).1,6,7 In such batteries, dual alkali cations (M+ and N+) are employed as shuttle ions. During the operation, their overall concentration in electrolytes is fixed, while the ratio between them is changed. Co-intercalation of M+ and N+ into metal hexacyanoferrates (MeHCF) at the cathode side mainly accounts for the high voltage outputs of the batteries.1,7,14–17 Such MeHCF belong to cubic Prussian blue analogues (PBA) with a general formula of AhMk[Fe(CN)6]l·mH2O (A = alkali cation ion, M = transition metal ion) that represent an important class of intercalation compounds. A typical structure model of PBA is displayed in Fig. 1a. As shown, the M(NC)6 and Fe(CN)6 octahedra are linked by sharing CN ligands to form a three-dimensional framework of linearly repeating –NC–Fe–CN–M–NC– units. Cavities in the framework provide massive interstitial sites (e.g., 8c, 24d, 32f, 48 g etc.) for alkali cations (A+) and/or water molecules (Fig. 1b). So far a variety of PBA have been identified as good hosts for alkali cations (A+).1,7,14–17 Unfortunately, there is limited information on the intercalation chemistry of PBA. In particular, the fundamental knowledge about how dual alkali cations are electrochemically co-intercalated into PBA especially in aqueous electrolytes, which is of interest scientifically, is still lacking at present.

In this work, graphene modified copper hexacyanoferrate (CuHCF) is first introduced as a cathode material for AMIB. Its unique electrochemical behaviors with dual alkali cations are unveiled. By combining it with carbon-coated TiP2O7 and NaTi2(PO4)3 as anode materials, a series of AMIB with high voltage output >1.23 V are validated. Meanwhile, all of them exhibit high power density as an ultra-capacitor, but with much higher energy density. Finally, the intercalation chemistry of alkali cations in CuHCF is unveiled by using multiple characterization means coupled with density functional theory (DFT) calculations.
2 Results and discussion
2.1 Structure of copper hexacyanoferrate
Copper hexacyanoferrate (CuHCF) as well as graphene modified CuHCF (CuHCF/Gr) were synthesized by a co-precipitation method described in the Method section (ESI Fig. S1†). The as-prepared CuHCFs are yellow solids. After graphene modification, they become black solids. Fig. 1c shows that black CuHCF/Gr exhibits the same face-centered cubic structure as Prussian blue.6,10,13,18–21 In its structure, Cu(II) and Fe(III) ions are octahedrally coordinated by –NC and –CN ligands, respectively, which form a three-dimensional framework with open [100] channels. Such a framework enables reversible insertion/extraction of alkali cations A+. As an ideal CuHCF has a general formula of ACuIIFeIII(CN)6, the electrochemical intercalation of A+ into CuHCFs can be written as the following equation:13ACuIIFeIII(CN)6 + xA+ + xe− = A1+xCuII[FeII(CN)6]x[FeIII(CN)6]1−x (x range from 0 to 1)
As shown, Cu(II) maintains the same valence, while Fe(III) is reduced to Fe(II) with zero unpaired electrons (t62g, s = 0) during cation intercalation. In the CuHCF/Gr, the molar ratio of K:Cu:Fe determined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) analysis is 0.91:1.47:1, indicating that one-third of Fe(CN)6 groups form vacancies occupied by coordinating and zeolite water molecules. Assuming that the chemical formula of our CuHCF is K0.04Cu1.47Fe(CN)6, its theoretical capacity should be 87 mA h g−1. Through the Rietveld refinement, CuHCF/Gr is found to adapt the Fm m group with a lattice parameter of 10.09 Å, and the bond distance of Fe–C, Cu–N and C–N are 1.92 Å, 1.92 Å and 1.21 Å, respectively. The size of the [100] channel is supposed to be 3.2 Å, and the interstitial sites have a diameter of 4.3 Å.22 In DFT calculations, the lattice parameter of CuHCF is optimized to be 10.22 Å, which agrees well with the experimental value (10.09 Å). Other calculated structural parameters (bond distance and bond angle) are also summarized in ESI Table S1,† which are in good accordance with experimental values, indicating that our calculations offer good accuracy in the description of CuHCF. Scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy images of CuHCF/Gr display that irregular CuHCF nanoparticles with sizes ranging from 50 to 200 nm are randomly deposited on graphene (Fig. 1d).
2.2 Electrochemical behaviors of CuHCF
The potential for the insertion of A+ (e.g., Li+, Na+ and K+) into cubic metal hexacyanoferrate is strongly dependent on the ionic radius of A+ cations. Generally, the intercalation of cations with a larger ionic radius occurs at higher voltage (Li+ < Na+ < K+).1,6,22–24 A similar trend is found in the obtained CuHCF/Gr. As shown in Fig. 2, CuHCF/Gr exhibits three pairs of redox peaks between 0.4 and 1.2 V vs. the SHE in Li2SO4 electrolytes. In Na2SO4 electrolytes, a pair of strong redox peaks is located at ca. 0.84 V vs. the SHE, followed by a pair of weak shoulder peaks near 1.12 V vs. the SHE. In K2SO4 electrolytes, only one pair of sharp redox peaks at 1.02 V vs. the SHE appears. Meanwhile, a specific capacity of 60.0 ± 1.5 mA h g−1 (1C rate) is found for CuHCF/Gr with either A+ (Fig. 2g–i), indicating that it has same storage ability with alkali cations in spite of their different ionic radii. The E1/2 (the voltage that is measured when the electrode material has discharged 50% of its total capacity) with different A+ follows the order: Li+ (0.75 V) < Na+ (0.85 V) < K+ (0.93 V). Its rate capability with A+ follows the same order as E1/2. As shown in Fig. 2g–i, the high-rate capacity retention of CuHCF/Gr is greatest when it is cycled with K+, for its 96.7% capacity retention at 10C, 95.6% at 40C and 91.6% at 60C. Intercalation of Li+ and Na+ into CuHCF/Gr occurs at moderately high rates, as it retains 83.7% and 86.6% at 60C during their respective reactions. The high rate capability of CuHCF/Gr can be ascribed to three factors. Firstly, the [100] channel with large open space in cubic CuHCF requires low activation energy for A+ migration. Secondly, the size of CuHCF particles is between 50 and 100 nm, giving short diffusion paths for A+. Thirdly, graphene in CuHCF/Gr acts as a 3D electronic network to diminish the resistance between CuHCF nanoparticles, which facilitates electron transfer.

All electrode potentials are vs. the standard hydrogen electrode (SHE). The black line corresponds to 0.5 M Li2SO4 in (a), (b), (d) and (e); or 0.5 M Na2SO4 in (c) and (f). The green line corresponds to 0.25 M Li2SO4/0.25 M Na2SO4 in (a) and (d); or 0.25 M Li2SO4/0.25 M K2SO4 in (b) and (e); or 0.25 M Na2SO4/0.25 M K2SO4 in (c) and (f). The red line corresponds to 0.1 M Li2SO4/0.4 M Na2SO4 in (a) and (d); or 0.1 M Li2SO4/0.4 M K2SO4 in (b) and (e); or 0.4 M Na2SO4/0.1 M K2SO4 in (c) and (f). The blue line corresponds to 0.5 M Na2SO4 in (a), (c), (d) and (f); or 0.5 M K2SO4 in (b) and (e). (g)–(i) are the summary of the rate capabilities of CuHCF in different electrolytes (Cs is the specific discharge capacity, and the percentage is the normalized discharge capacity which is compared with the discharge capacity measured at 1C rate). E (V) is normalized to the SHE, and 1C equals 60 mA g−1. 
The electrochemical behaviors of CuHCF/Gr with dual alkali cations are also unveiled. Our previous studies show that the electrochemical behavior of cubic metal hexacyanoferrate (e.g. NiHCF, NixZnyHCF and InHCF) with dual alkali cations is dominated by the larger alkali cations in mixed-ion electrolytes. A similar phenomenon is found for our CuHCF/Gr (Fig. 2a–f and ESI S2†). In Li2SO4/Na2SO4 mixed-ion electrolytes, two pairs of redox peaks appear, and their potentials are close to the ones in Na2SO4. Meanwhile, the voltage plateaus in mixed-electrolytes are also similar to the ones in Na2SO4, which are 100 mV higher than the one in Li2SO4. The discharge capacities in mixed-electrolytes are kept the same as the one in Li2SO4 or Na2SO4. The E1/2 slightly increases with an increase of Na+ concentration in electrolytes (ESI Fig. S3†), implying that the existence of Na+ gives rise to high working voltage, which is desirable for high energy density. Moreover, the capacity retentions of CuHCF/Gr in 0.1 M Li2SO4 + 0.4 M Na2SO4 and 0.25 M Li2SO4 + 0.25 M Na2SO4 at 60C are 86.7% and 85.5%, which are higher than the one in 0.5 M Li2SO4 (83.7%). It is obvious that the introduction of Na+ into Li2SO4 electrolytes is also beneficial to the high rate capability of CuHCF/Gr. In K+-containing mixed-ion electrolytes, similar phenomena are observed. As shown, only one pair of redox peaks is observed in Li2SO4/K2SO4 and/or Na2SO4/K2SO4 mixed-ion electrolytes, and the potentials of anodic and cathodic peaks are close to those in K2SO4. At a scan rate of 2 mV s−1, their potential differences are within 120 mV, implying a fast reaction between Fe(II) and Fe(III) accompanying reversible storage and release of alkali cations. Such a fast reaction is found to be a combination of a capacitive process (57.6%) and diffusion-limited redox reaction (42.4%),25–28 as shown in ESI Fig. S4.† Meanwhile, the discharge voltage plateau in K+-containing mixed-ion electrolytes is almost identical to that in K2SO4 alone, which is higher than those in Li2SO4 (∼200 mV) and Na2SO4 (∼100 mV). For a battery cathode, it is always desirable to pursue high voltage to improve the energy density and good reversibility for high round-trip efficiency. Accordingly, the selection of K+-containing electrolytes for CuHCF/Gr is preferable for both high energy density and good efficiency.
2.3 Aqueous mixed-ion batteries beyond 1.23 V
Based on the unique electrochemical behaviors of CuHCF/Gr in mixed-ion electrolytes, a series of high-voltage RAMB based on “M+/N+-dual shuttles” (B-I, CuHCF/Li+ + Na+/TiP2O7; B-II, CuHCF/Li+ + K+/TiP2O7; and B-III, CuHCF/Na+ + K+/NaTi2(PO4)3) are assembled. Such batteries rely on two electrochemical processes. One is the co-insertion/extraction reactions of M+ (small ionic radius) and N+ (large ionic radius) at a CuHCF/Gr cathode, and the other refers to the release and storage of M+ at an ion-selective TiP2O7 or NaTi2(PO4)3 anode (ESI Fig. S5†). The galvanostatic profiles of B-I, B-II and B-III along with the voltage profiles of their individual anodes and cathodes vs. the SHE are displayed in Fig. 3a–c. As shown, their average voltage outputs (Eavs) are found to be 1.32 V (B-I), 1.39 V (B-II), and 1.53 V (B-III), respectively. Meanwhile, a specific energy of 47.3 W h kg−1 for B-I, 50.7 W h kg−1 for B-II and 56.1 W h kg−1 for B-III based on the total mass of active electrode materials are obtained. The galvanostatic profiles of CuHCF/Li+/TiP2O7 (B-IV) and CuHCF/Na+/NaTi2(PO4)3 (B-V) batteries that operate on single-ion electrolytes are also added for comparison (Fig. 3d). Their Eavs are only 1.19 V and 1.45 V, lower than those of their corresponding AMIB. Obviously, utilizing mixed-ion electrolytes instead of single-ion electrolytes for CuHCF/TiP2O7 and CuHCF/NaTi2(PO4)3 batteries can raise the voltage output. The increases of the voltage output mainly come from the CuHCF cathode, although the working voltages for TiP2O7 and NaTi2(PO4)3 anode can be decreased by 40–50 mV when using mixed-ion electrolytes.1 In addition to high Eavs, B-I, B-II and B-III also possess excellent high-rate capability (Fig. 4a–c). At current rates as high as 60C, the capacities of B-I, B-II and B-III remain at 38%, 42% and 71% of those at 1.5C, respectively.

Among them, B-III is the most promising system for high power energy storage as it can deliver a specific power of 3006 W kg−1 at a specific energy of 33 W h kg−1 (Fig. 4e). Moreover, B-III exhibits good cycle life, during galvanostatic cycling between 1.83 V and 0.4 V at 1.5C, about 92.7% of the initial discharge capacity is retained after 100 cycles. The coulombic efficiency is around 100% during cycling except for the first cycle, suggesting that many side reactions (e.g., water electrolysis reactions) are eliminated during cycling despite the high voltage charge limit (1.83 V) for aqueous electrolytes.
2.4 Cation-intercalation mechanism in CuHCF
As the intercalation voltage of K+ is the highest among A+, the K+-intercalation reaction is selected as a probe to study the cation-intercalation mechanism in CuHCF. Ex situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is firstly used to analyze the chemical states of four elements (Fe, Cu, K and N) in CuHCF/Gr upon electrochemical cycling. Fe 2p core levels of the CuHCF/Gr at a–g states are displayed in Fig. 5a. Two peaks at 708.2 eV and 721.1 eV for CuHCF/Gr at a and g states can be attributed to the 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 of Fe(II). From a to d (charging), the intensities of the two peaks decrease, and another two new peaks at 709.9 eV and 723.4 eV that are related to Fe(III) appear at charged states (b–d). From d to g (discharging), the intensities of Fe(III) peaks are decreased, while the Fe(II) 2p peak intensities increase. Through peak fitting of Fe 2p3/2 XPS spectra (see ESI Fig. S6†), the percentage compositions of Fe(II) and Fe(III) in CuHCF/Gr at a–g states are summarized in Table S2.† Cu 2p, K 2p, N 1s and F 1s core level spectra were also collected (Fig. 5b–d and ESI Fig. S7†). The peaks centered at 935.3 eV and 955.3 eV can be ascribed to the 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 of Cu(II), which remain almost the same upon cycling. The densities of K(I) 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 peaks at 293.0 ± 0.3 eV and 296.0 ± 0.3 eV decrease from a to d and increase from d to g (Fig. 5c). So it can be inferred that K+ extraction/insertion reactions happen during their respective charge/discharge processes. During the electrochemical cycling, N element follows a different trend than K element. As shown in Fig. 5d, N 1s peak is positively shifted from 397.6 eV to 398.1 eV during the charge process (a to d), and negatively shifted from 398.1 eV to 397.6 eV during the discharge process. It can be explained by the fact that the K+-intercalation into CuHCF leads to the conversion of Fe(III) into Fe(II), thus causing the electron feedback from Fe(II) to CN ligands. The atomic ratios of different elements upon cycling determined by XPS are also summarized in Fig. 5f and ESI Table S3.† As shown, the K/Fe ratio decreases from 0.38 to 0.04 during charging, and then goes back to 0.43 after discharging. However, during cycling, the Cu/Fe and N/Fe atomic ratios remain almost the same without obvious changes. Compared to Cu, Fe and N, the obvious composition changes for K in CuHCF/Gr are related to the insertion/extraction of K+. All the above XPS results illustrate that Fe is the main redox center of CuHCF which involves the reversible conversion between Fe(II) and Fe(III), accompanied by the extraction/insertion of K+. In order to quantitatively determine how many K+ can be intercalated into CuHCF, the chemical compositions of CuHCF/Gr with fully charged and discharged states are compared by ICP-OES. It is found that the molar ratio of K:Cu:Fe in CuHCF changes from 0.04:1.47:1 to 0.91:1.47:1 after K+ intercalation, corresponding to a nearly 0.87 electron redox process.

(g) Changes of the molar ratio of different elements in CuHCF upon charging in 0.1 M Na2SO4 + 0.4 M K2SO4 (top), 0.5 M K2SO4 and 0.5 M Na2SO4 solutions (down). The potentials of Q1, Q2 and Q3 states refer to the end-of-discharge voltage, mid-point voltage, and end-of-charge voltage, respectively. 
Structural evolutions of CuHCF/Gr with electrochemical cycling are investigated by ex situ XRD. Fig. 5e shows that CuHCF/Gr maintains its cubic structure upon cycling, suggesting a quasi-solid-solution reaction. The XRD reflections such as the (200) and (220) are negatively shifted during charging (K+-extraction), and positively shifted during discharging (K+-insertion). Obviously, K+-insertion into CuHCF/Gr results in lattice contraction, which is also observed in other metal hexacyanoferrates.1 However, a very small lattice contraction (from 10.09 Å to 9.99 Å, about 0.99%) after K+-insertion is found, which is close to a zero-strain characteristic. Such a small lattice contraction is mainly linked to the slight decrease in the Fe–C bond distance during reduction. And it is also associated with the measured small polarization and good cycle life for CuHCF/Gr. In mixed-ion electrolytes, a co-intercalation reaction of dual alkali cations is supposed to occur in CuHCF. To verify it, the chemical compositions of CuHCF/Gr in 0.5 M Na2SO4, 0.5 M K2SO4 and 0.1 M Na2SO4 + 0.4 M K2SO4 mixed-electrolytes at different states are analyzed by ICP-OES. As ESI Table S4† shows, the molar ratios of [Na]/[Fe], [K]/[Fe] and [Na] + [K]/[Fe] for CuHCF/Gr are 0.04, 0.03 and 0.03 before cation intercalation (Q3 state), respectively. After cations are gradually intercalated into CuHCF/Gr, the [Na]/[Fe], [K]/[Fe] and [Na] + [K]/[Fe] ratios reach 0.78, 0.92 and 0.84 at the Q1 state, respectively. Particularly, the [Na] + [K]/[Fe] ratio (0.84) in mixed-electrolytes at the Q1 state is close to the [Na]/[Fe] ratio (0.78) in 0.5 M Na2SO4 and [K]/[Fe] ratio (0.92) in 0.5 M K2SO4. It is indicated that both Na+ and K+ can be intercalated into CuHCF/Gr in mixed-ion electrolytes without loss of the capacity, which coincides with the electrochemical data. Moreover, the molar ratio of [Na]/[K] for CuHCF/Gr in 0.1 M Na2SO4 + 0.4 M K2SO4 mixed-electrolytes changes from 0.50 at the Q3 state, to 0.09 at the Q2 state, and to 0.04 at the Q1 state, which is not the same as that (0.25) in mixed-electrolytes. The decrease of the [Na]/[K] ratio during cation intercalation illustrates that K+ is preferentially intercalated into CuHCF relative to Na+. It can also well explain the fact that the electrochemical behaviors in Na+/K+ mixed-ion electrolytes are among A+: K+ > Na+ > Li+, regardless of its same storage ability with them. As previously mentioned, open-framework CuHCF can provide large interstitial sites that allow reversible insertion/extraction of alkali cation A+ with little crystallographic lattice strain. The binding energy with different alkali A+ is evaluated by using DFT. As for Li+, the 24d site gives the lowest Eb, while the 48 g site gives the highest Eb as in shown Table 1. In terms of Na+ and K+, they prefer to occupy the 8c site in comparison with the 24d site. The reason is that small cations Li+ are more stable at the 24d site for shorter cation–anion bonding distances, while large cations Na+ and K+ are less favorable to occupy the 24d site because of the space limitation. The calculated volumes of ACuFe(CN)6 and A2CuFe(CN)6 units with A+ occupy in Fig. 6b. It can be seen that A+-intercalation at the 48 g site tends to shrink the volume while K+-intercalation into the 24d site cause obvious volume expansion (from 290.4 Å3 to 299.2 Å3). This can be probably because the 48 g site provides enough free space for A+, and K+ in the 24d site has strong steric repulsion with its surrounding atoms, resulting in volume expansion. When considering the most stable interstitial site, the volume changes after the intercalation of Li+, Na+ and K+ are within 0.7%, 0.5% and 2.4%, respectively, which are close to the zero-strain characteristic. Such a phenomenon is consistent with our above XRD analysis. Moreover, the binding energy (Eb) follows the order: Eb (K+, 8c) < Eb (Na+, 8c) < Eb (Li+, 24d), providing a good explanation for why CuHCF/Gr possesses ion-selectivity among A+: K+ > Na+ > Li+.

3 Conclusions
In summary, a series of high-voltage AMIB (B-I, B-II and B-III) based on CuHCF, TiP2O7 and NaTi2(PO4)3 are validated. They have high power density comparable to that of an ultra-capacitor (>1000 W kg−1), but with much higher energy density (>45 W h kg−1). Among them, NaTi2(PO4)3/Na+ + K+/CuHCF (B-III) has a specific energy of 56 W h kg−1 with an Eav of 1.6 V and can deliver a specific power of 3006 W kg−1. The cation intercalation chemistry in CuHCF is also revealed. The iron, not copper, atom in CuHCF is identified as the center that involves the redox reaction accompanying the reversible (de)intercalation of alkali cations (Li+, Na+ and K+). Cation intercalation in CuHCF induces negligible structural deformations (zero-strain characteristic), which accounts for the excellent electrochemical stability. The intercalation is also found to be strongly affected by the ionic radii of inserted species. The intercalation voltage for the alkali cations follows the order: K+ > Na+ > Li+. Meanwhile, Li+ with a small size is supposed to be co-inserted into the 24d site, while Na+ and K+ prefer to occupy the 8c site. Moreover, CuHCF exhibits specific ion-selectivity: K+ > Na+ > Li+, which explains the higher voltage outputs of AMIB relative to aqueous batteries operating on a single shuttle. Overall, our studies not only enrich the family of AMIB, but also offer new insights into intercalation chemistry of open-framework structured compounds, which greatly broaden our horizons for battery research.
4 Experimental
4.1 Cathode materials syntheses
Graphene (surface area 200 m2 g−1, thickness 2.4 nm) was obtained through thermal annealing of graphene oxide at 800 °C. Graphene modified CuHCF (CuHCF/Gr) was synthesized by a co-precipitation method from previous literature.13 Typically, equal amounts of 0.05 M K3Fe(CN)6 and 0.1 M Cu(NO3)2 solutions were simultaneously added into the graphene suspension under vigorous stirring at the constant drop rate of 0.35 mL min−1. The black CuHCF/Gr slurry was formed after the completion of the reaction. Finally, the precipitates were washed with de-ionized water several times and then dried at 80 °C overnight. The mass ratio of CuHCF to Gr in CuHCF/Gr is 20:1. Yellow precipitates were obtained for CuHCF by using deionized water instead of the graphene suspension.
4.2 Anode materials syntheses
Carbon-coated TiP2O7 and NaTi2(PO4)3 were prepared by a solid-state reaction and chemical vapor deposition method.1,23 Typically, desired amounts of different precursors (Na2CO3, TiO2 and NH4H2PO4) with stoichiometric numbers were ball-milled to form pastes (400 rpm, 6 h). The dried pastes were successively heated for 5 h at 300 °C and for 12 h at 900 °C in air with intermediate grindings. The obtained white TiP2O7 and NaTi2(PO4)3 solids were homogenized in a mortar for further use. 2.5 g of as-prepared white solids, 2 g of glucose and an appropriate amount of ethanol were mixed and then ball-milled for 4 h. After evaporating at 80 °C, the mixtures were calcined at 800 °C for 3 h in a mixed gas of C2H4 (5%) and Ar (95%) in order to obtain carbon-coated TiP2O7 and NaTi2(PO4)3.
4.3 Characterization
The morphologies of samples were analyzed by using a Hitachi S-4800 field emission scanning-electron microscope. Transmission electron microscope images were obtained by using an FEI Tecnai G2 F20 TEM at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. Powder X-ray diffraction patterns were collected by using an AXS D8 Advance diffractometer (Cu Kα radiation; receiving slit, 0.2 mm; scintillation counter, 40 mA; 40 kV) from Bruker Inc. X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were recorded by using a Shimadzu/Kratos AXIS Ultra XPS spectrometer. Inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy experiments were performed with a Perkin-Elmer Optima 2100DV optical emission spectrometer.
4.4 Electrochemical measurements
All electrochemical tests were carried out on Solartron 1470E multi-channel potentiostats. A CuHCF/Gr electrode was employed as a working electrode in the tests. In a three-electrode configuration, an Ag/AgCl electrode (0.2 V vs. the SHE) and Pt wire were used as the reference and counter electrodes, respectively. In a two-electrode configuration, a TiP2O7 or NaTi2(PO4)3 electrode was utilized as both the reference and counter electrodes. The electrodes were prepared by casting slurries of active materials (75 wt%), Super P (15 wt%) and polyvinylidene fluoride (10 wt%) in n-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone on a steel iron grid, and air drying at 80 °C for 12 h. Mass loadings for the active materials were around 8 mg cm−2.
4.5 DFT calculations
The calculations were based on a density functional theory (DFT) method in the generalized gradient approximation with the Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof functional,29 as implemented in the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP), which employed a plane-wave basis.16,17 The plane-wave energy cutoff was set to be 500.0 eV, and the electronic energy convergence was 10−5 eV. During relaxations, the force convergence for ions was 10−2 eV Å−1. An F-centered 6 × 6 × 6 Monkhorst–Pack k-point mesh for primitive cell was used to sample the irreducible Brillouin zone. In AxCuFe(CN)6 (x = 1 or 2), Fe ions are located in the octahedral environment and bond to carbon, and such carbon-coordinated Fe in a strong crystal field favors the low-spin configuration. To correctly characterize the localization of Fe d-electrons, the GGA+U method with a Hubbard-type potential to describe the d-part of the Hamiltonian was applied. Previous studies using U = 3.0 eV for the low-spin Fe had demonstrated that GGA+U calculations could provide good predictions about the structural and electronic properties of hexacyanoferrate compounds.6,30,31 Then we set a U value of 3.0 eV for Fe atom during the calculations of structural relaxation and electronic structures. For the reversible insertion/extraction of alkali cations A+, the reaction can be written as follows: ACuFe(CN)6 + A+ + e− ↔ A2CuFe(CN)6(1)
The binding energy between A+ and ACuFe(CN)6 (Eb) can be calculated using the following equation: Eb = E[A2CuFe(CN)6] − E[ACuFe(CN)6] − E[A](2)where Eb is the binding energy, E[A2CuFe(CN)6], E[ACuFe(CN)6] and E[A] are the total energies of A2CuFe(CN)6, ACuFe(CN)6 and metallic A that are calculated using DFT. The calculated energies of metallic Li, Na and K are as follows: E(Li) = −1.89 eV; E(Na) = −1.30 eV and E(K) = −1.04 eV.
