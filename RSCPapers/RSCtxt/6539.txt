    , Accepted 20th July 2021First published on 26th July 2021AbstractAnaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC), as one of the most aggressive human malignancies, cannot be cured by 131iodine (131I) internal radiotherapy (RT) because the tumor cells cannot effectively take up 131I and are resistant to radiotherapy. In this study, a facile and simple method was proposed to synthesize mesoporous polydopamine nanoparticles (MPDA) and tailor their morphologies by component-adjusting Pluronic micelle-guided polymerization. Then, MPDA were used not only as nanocarriers to radiolabel 131I, but also as photothermal conversion agents for photothermal therapy (PTT) to promote RT. The iodine-labeling capacity and photothermal conversion efficiency of MPDA can be enhanced by optimizing their morphologies. It was found that MPDA NPs with a cerebroid pore channel structure (CPDA) showed the highest iodine-carrying capacity and a higher photothermal conversion efficiency as a result of their maximum specific surface area and unique morphology. In subsequent experiments in vitro and in vivo, our ATC animal models showed impressive therapeutic responses to CPDA-131I NPs because of the synergistic effect of PTT and RT. Additionally, CPDA-125I NPs can be utilized to obtain high-quality SPETC/CT images of tumors, which can guide clinical therapy for ATC. Considering their great biosafety, these radioiodine-labeled CPDA NPs may serve as a promising tool in combined therapy and diagnosis in ATC.
Introduction
Thyroid carcinoma (TC) can be mainly categorized into differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC), anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) and medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC). Therapy and imaging of metastatic DTC has achieved great success by the way of radiotherapy (RT) of 131I, while ATC is still one of the most aggressive malignant solid tumors with a median survival time of only 4 to 12 months, threatening human health seriously.1–3 There has not been an effective treatment strategy for ATC yet.4–7 Therefore, a novel therapeutic regimen is desperately needed. The therapeutic strategy of internal 131I RT has the merits of safety, effectiveness and economical treatment modality, but it does not work in the therapy of ATC.8–11 Sodium iodide symporter (NIS) cannot be expressed on the ATC cell membrane, resulting in the failure of intracellular 131I enrichment.12–14 Therefore, effectively delivering 131I to the tumor site is a hopeful way for ATC treatment.
With the development of nanomedicine over the past few decades, it has been demonstrated that nanoparticles as nanocarriers have successfully realized the delivery of 131I to target tumors.15–18 Nevertheless, this kind of treatment still has its limitations to ATC patients, including low 131I loading capacity of nanocarriers and radiotherapy resistance. Nowadays, porous nanoparticles show huge advantages in the field of drug delivery, which can effectively improve the loadings of chemotherapeutic drugs19,20 or other substances.21,22 A good case in point is that mesoporous silicon dioxide nanoparticles (MPSNs) were used as nanocarriers for loading various drug molecules by their open pore structure and adjustable pore channels to treat cancer.19 However, improving 131I loading capacity by constructing mesoporous nanoparticles has not yet been achieved because their surfaces lack effective functional groups to anchor 131I. More importantly, due to the failure of monotherapy, the combination of two or more treatments is recommended in ATC patients.23–25 Adding hyperthermia to radiotherapy prevents DNA breaks from getting repaired, resulting in more residual DNA breaks and cell apoptosis.26–28 Thanks to the tunability of the nanostructure and the components of nanoparticles, different therapeutic strategies and imaging modalities can be combined in one nanoparticle system to synergistically treat the tumors.29,30 Therefore, designing and synthesizing porous nanoparticles with high 131I loading for radiotherapy, combined with hyperthermia, is most likely a great breakthrough in the treatment of ATC.
Polydopamine (PDA), as a biocompatible molecule, has attracted tremendous attention in biomedicine.31–34 PDA and its coated nanoparticles have been widely used as near-infrared (NIR) light-absorbing agents for photothermal therapy (PTT) because PDA materials can strongly absorb light in the region of NIR (wavelength, 700–1100 nm).35–37 NIR-induced PTT is a minimally invasive therapeutic approach that converts light energy into heat to ablate tumors.38–41 Moreover, the abundant active groups such as –OH and –NH2 on the surface of the PDA materials can be conjugated by various therapeutic molecules for RT and chemotherapy.42,43 PDA nanomaterials show excellent NIR-absorbing capability due to the existence of a benzoquinone structure.42 In addition, PDA containing phenolic hydroxyl group is beneficial for the conjugation of 131I for RT. Therefore, PDA nanocarriers combined with RT and PTT were developed to improve the therapeutic effect of ATC.
Multiform PDA nanocarriers were firstly synthesized by Pluronic micelle-guided polymerization assembly in alkaline solution. Then, 131I was labeled to the surface of the PDA nanocarrier by the iodogen method.44 The morphological features and physicochemical properties of PDA nanocarriers were investigated through SEM, TEM and BET. The photothermal conversion efficiency, 131I-labeling rate and cellular uptake rate of various PDA nanoparticles were compared in vitro. The antitumor activity of 131I-radiolabeled cerebroid polydopamine nanoparticles (CPDA-131I) was evaluated in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, SPECT/CT was used to perform in vivo imaging and characterize the biodistribution of the nanoparticles. Finally, histopathology was used to evaluate the biosafety of CPDA-131I. In this work, the morphology of PDA nanoparticles can be precisely controlled by changing the composition of micelles. Moreover, the desirable porous structure and specific surface area can be obtained by the optimization of the morphology to enhance the loading of 131I for RT and photothermal conversion efficiency for PTT. Our study demonstrates that CPDA can significantly improve 131I delivery capacity and photothermal conversion efficiency, which provides a new approach for ATC therapy by combining PTT and RT together (Scheme 1).

Experimental
Materials
Dopamine hydrochloride (DA) was purchased from J&K Chemical Co. Ltd. Pluronic F127 and P123, sodium hydroxide (NaOH), methylene dichloride, sodium iodide, calcein-acetoxymethyl (calcein-AM) and propidium iodide (PI), and iodogen were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich Co. Ltd. Anhydrous ethanol (EOH) and ammonium hydroxide (26–28%) were provided by Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), fetal bovine serum (FBS), trypsin–EDTA, Alexa Fluor® 488 annexin V and MEM nonessential amino acids (NEAA) were supplied by Thermo Fisher Scientific Co. Ltd. Cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) was purchased from Shanghai Yuanzhi Biotechnology Co. Ltd. 131I was purchased from Shanghai Xinke Co. Ltd. Deionized water was used for all experiments and all chemical reagents were used as received without further purification.
Synthesis of PDA nanoparticles with different morphologies
The multiform PDA nanoparticles were synthesized by mixing different feed ratio of F127 and P123 guided polymerization assembly.  In brief, 0.5 g of F127 and P123 with different ratios of 1:0, 3:1, 1:1, 1:3 and 0:1 was dispersed in deionized water for 0.5 h to form a uniform solution. Then, DA (0.2 g) was added to the above solution. After that, 0.5 mL of ammonium hydroxide was dropped into the reaction mixture to trigger the polymerization of DA. The whole reaction process lasted for 24 h at the temperature of 90 °C under gentle stirring. Finally, the resultant PDA nanoparticles were collected by centrifugation and then washed with water and ethanol several times to remove the template of the micelles. SPDA was prepared according to a previously reported method without templates.45
Characterization
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Tecnai G2 Spirit Biotwin, USA) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JEOL JSM-7800F Prime, USA) were carried out to observe the morphologies of these PDA nanoparticles. The hydrodynamic diameter and zeta potential of these nanoparticles were detected using a Zetasizer Nanoseries ZS (Malvern, UK). The N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms were recorded using a SSA and porosity analyzer (Autosorb-IQ3, USA) at −196 °C. All these samples were degassed in a vacuum at 140 °C overnight before the measurements, and then the SSA and pore size distributions of the nanoparticles were calculated based on the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) and Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) methods, respectively. UV-vis-NIR absorption spectrum of the CPDA solution (0.01 mg mL−1) was scanned and recorded from 200 nm to 1100 nm.

131I labeling, radiolabeling stability and cellular uptake assay
To compare the iodine-labeling capacity of the PDA nanoparticles with different morphologies, these PDA nanoparticles were labeled with 131I by the approach of the iodogen method. The reaction processes were performed under the same procedures. Briefly, 10 μl of Na131I (50 mCi mL−1) and 50 μL of PDA nanoparticles (5 mg mL−1) were dropped into 1.5 mL Eppendorf (EP) tubes that were pre-coated with iodogen. The reaction mixtures were shaken at 1000 rpm for 10 min at 37 °C. The 131I-labeling rates (RLR) were determined by radioactive thin-layer chromatography (Radio-TLC, Germany) using NaCl solutions (0.9%) as the mobile phase according to eqn (1). Pt and Ca are the sums of the counts measured of the target peaks and all chromatograms, respectively. (1)
Excess 131I was removed by centrifugation filtration with the 10 kDa molecular weight cut-off (MWCO) membrane before the in vitro and in vivo experiments. To investigate the cellular uptake of these PDA-131I nanoparticles, 8305C cells were seeded in 24-well plates at a density of 5 × 105 cells per well and incubated overnight for attachment. Next, these PDA-131I nanoparticles (5 μCi) or free 131I (5 μCi) were added into the above wells and allowed to incubate for 1 h. The cells were washed with precooled PBS three times, and the PBS was collected for further measurement. Then, the cells were lysed by NaOH–SDS solutions (0.2 M NaOH, 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, SDS). The radioactivity of both cell lysates and PBS was detected using a gamma counter (SN-695, Solar Ring Photoelectric Instrument, Shanghai). Furthermore, the radiolabeling stability of CPDA-131I was examined in PBS (1 mM, pH 7.4) and fetal bovine serum at 37 °C, and the RLR of CPDA-131I in the two solutions at 0 h, 6 h, 12 h, 1 d, 3 d, 5 d and 7d was detected using TLC and the gamma counter.

In vitro photothermal conversion performance
To evaluate the photothermal conversion efficiency of the CPDA nanoparticles in vitro, SPDA and CPDA (1 mL, 400 μg mL−1) were irradiated using an 808 nm laser at a power of 1 W cm−2 for 5 min. During the irradiation, a thermal infrared camera (Fluke Ti110, USA) was used to take real-time thermal images and record the temperature changes of the solutions. Furthermore, the thermal stability of the PDA nanoparticles was also investigated. After the same laser irradiation, all the solutions were allowed to cool down in 10 minutes and this process was repeated 5 times and the temperature was recorded in real time using the thermal infrared camera. The photothermal conversion efficiency (η) and time constant (τs) were calculated using two previously reported equations, which are shown as eqn (2) and (3), respectively.46–48 (2) (3)

Cell culture
The L929, a mouse fibroblast cell line, was originally provided by the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, USA). 8305C, a human anaplastic thyroid carcinoma cell line, was obtained from Zhong Qiao Xin Zhou Biotechnology Co. Ltd (Shanghai, China). L929 cells were cultured in DMEM containing 10% FBS, while 8305C cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% GlutaMAX and 1% NEAA (100×) under a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 at 37 °C.

In vitro cytotoxicity assay
For the in vitro cytotoxicity assay, L929 cells at the logarithmic growth phase were seeded into 96-well plates at 5 × 103 cells per well and cultured for 22 h for attachment. The cells were exposed to different concentrations of CPDA and further co-cultured for 24 h. Then 10 μL of CCK-8 reagent was added into each well, and the absorbance value of each sample well at 450 nm was detected using a microplate reader (Varioskan Flash, Thermo Scientific).
To investigate in vitro PTT and radiotherapy effects of CPDA-131I, 8305C cells were seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 6 × 103 cells per well and incubated for 22 h for cell attachment. Then, the 8305C cells were treated with various concentrations of CPDA with or without 131I and an 808 nm laser at 1 W cm−2 for 5 min. 24 h later, the cell viabilities relative to the control cells were determined using a standard CCK-8 assay. In order to understand the detailed synergistic interaction between the PTT of CPDA + NIR and radiotherapy of 131I, the combination index (CI) was calculated using an equation reported previously eqn (4).49,50 (4)
In this equation, D1 and D2 are the doses of drug 1 and drug 2, which can produce a particular Fa (e.g., 75% inhibition of cell viability), and Dx1 and Dx2 are the doses of drugs achieving the same Fa. CI value greater than 1.1 indicates an antagonistic effect, CI value between 0.9 and 1.1 manifests an additive effect, and CI value less than 0.9 manifests a synergistic effect.
As for the calcein AM/PI co-stained study, 8305C cells were cultured in a 12-well plate at a density of 2 × 105 per well and treated with PBS, PBS + NIR, CPDA-131I, CPDA + NIR and CPDA-131I + NIR (CPDA with or without 131I: 100 μg mL−1; NIR: 808 nm, 1 W cm−2, 5 min; 131I: 160 μCi mL−1). 4 h later, the 8305C cells were co-stained using calcein-AM/PI and observed under a fluorescence microscope (Leica, TCS SP8, Germany). Flow cytometry assay was adopted to investigate the apoptosis of 8305C cells. The cells were treated in the same manner as in the calcein AM/PI co-stained study and were stained using an Alexa Fluor® 488 annexin V kit. Then, the cells were collected and analyzed using a BD LSRFortessa flow cytometer. To evaluate the DNA damage levels of the 8305C cells after various treatments (CPDA with or without 131I: 100 μg mL−1; NIR: 808 nm, 1 W cm−2, 5 min; 131I: 160 μCi mL−1), γ-H2AX immunofluorescence staining assay was performed. The 8305C cells were seeded in a 24-well confocal plate at a density of 5 × 104 cells per well and incubated overnight, followed by various treatments (CPDA with or without 131I: 100 μg mL−1; NIR: 808 nm, 1 W cm−2, 5 min; 131I: 160 μCi mL−1). Then, 4% paraformaldehyde and Triton X-100 were used to fix the cells and permeate the cells. 5% bovine serum albumin was added to block the nonspecific reaction sites. Next, primary antibodies (γ-H2AX and ab81299; Abcam Inc.) and their corresponding secondary antibodies with a CY3 tag were incubated with the cells in the dark. DAPI was used to stain the cell nuclei and then the cells were washed with PBS 3 times. Finally, fluorescence images were acquired by using confocal fluorescence microscopy (Olympus, IX73, Japan).
Animals and tumor models
BALB/c mice (∼4 weeks) and Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats (∼200 g) were purchased from Shanghai Lingchang Company. All animal procedures were performed in accordance with the Guidelines for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of Shanghai Jiao Tong University and approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of Xin Hua Hospital affiliated to the Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine (Shanghai, China). The 8305C (2 × 106) cells were suspended in 200 μL of DMEM (containing 50% Matrigel, 356234, Corning) and then they were injected subcutaneously into the right armpit of each mouse.

In vivo photothermal performance
When the tumors grew up to 1000–1500 mm3, the 8305C tumor-bearing nude mice were randomly divided into two groups (n = 3). One group was administered with 200 μl of PBS via the tail vein, and the other group was injected with 200 μl of CPDA (1 mg mL−1). After 6 h, all tumors were exposed to an 808 nm laser at 1 W cm−2 for 5 min and real-time thermal images were recorded at predetermined time point time points using an infrared camera.

In vivo SPECT/CT imaging

125I is a type of radionuclide with a low-energy gamma ray and a long half-life (∼60 days) and is more suitable to obtain high quality SPECT/CT images and to monitor the metabolism of long-circulating drugs in the body compared to 131I. Therefore, in this study, 125I was used to perform in vivo SPECT/CT imaging. 8305C tumor-bearing mice were injected with 200 μL CPDA-125I (200 μCi) through their tail vein and images were obtained using a SPECT/CT system (MI Lab, the Netherlands) at various time points (1 h, 24 h, 3 d and 7 d). PMOD software (PMOD Technologies LLC, USA) was used to analyze the SPECT/CT images.
Blood circulation and biodistribution
To evaluate the blood circulation of CPDA-131I, blood of SD rats was collected from the retinal vein of mice (n = 3) at various time points (10 min, 30 min, 1 h, 2 h, 6 h, 12 h, 24 h and 48 h) after intravenous injection of CPDA-131I (1 mL, 0.4 mCi). To quantitatively analyze the biodistribution of CPDA-131I in different organs, nude mice (n = 3) were sacrificed by neck dissection 24 h after intravenous injection. The heart, liver, spleen, lungs, kidneys, muscle, skin, bone, brain and tumor were collected and weighed. The radioactivity of the blood samples and the major organs were determined using a gamma counter.

In vivo tumor radiotherapy and photothermal therapy
The 8305C tumor-bearing mice were divided randomly into 5 groups (n = 5) when the tumor volume reached approximately 100 mm3. Then, the 5 groups were treated with various formulations, including 200 μL PBS with or without NIR irradiation (808 nm, 1 W cm−2, 5 min), CPDA (200 μL, 1 mg L−1) with NIR irradiation, and CPDA-131I (200 μL, 1 mg mL−1 of CPDA, 400 μCi of 131I) with or without NIR irradiation. In the two RT groups, CPDA-131I was injected intravenously every 6 days. Furthermore, the three groups with NIR irradiation were injected with CPDA or PBS solution every 2 d, and then the tumor sites were irradiated using a NIR laser for 6 h after the injection. The tumor volumes and body weights of all groups were monitored during the therapy period and the tumor volumes were calculated using the following equation (eqn (5)). (5)
The relative body weight, relative tumor volume and relative tumor weight were calculated as W/W0, V/V0 and V/VPBS, respectively. All mice were sacrificed by neck dissection after 22 days. The tumor tissues were collected and immersed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 24 h, followed by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) immunofluorescence staining assay. The major organs, including the heart, liver, spleen, lungs and kidneys of each group, were harvested for further H&E staining.
Statistical analysis
All data were presented as mean ± stand deviation (S.D.). Student's t-test was used to compare the differences among groups and p < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.
Results and discussion
Characterization
As illustrated in Scheme 2, mesoporous polydopamine nanoparticles can be easily synthesized under Pluronic micelle guided polymerization assembly by changing the ratio of F127 and P123, which were used to adjust the morphologies of PDA nanoparticles. The SEM and TEM images (Fig. 1a and Fig. S1a†) found that DA was self-assembled into smooth polydopamine nanoparticles (SPDA) in the absence of micelles. However, the morphologies of the PDA nanoparticles dramatically changed when adding F127 or P123 into the reaction system. By simply adjusting the F127/P123 ratio from 1:0 to 3:1, 1:1 and 1:3, and then to 0:1, the morphology of the PDA nanoparticles can be continuously tuned from polyporous polydopamine nanoparticles (PPDA) to macroporous polydopamine nanoparticles (MPDA), cerebroid polydopamine nanoparticles (CPDA), bowl-shaped polydopamine nanoparticles (BPDA) and acetabuliform polydopamine nanoparticles (APDA), respectively (Fig. 1b–f and Fig. S1b–f†). The morphological features of PDA nanoparticles depended on the composition of Pluronic micelles, so we proposed a versatile template oriented assembly process for these PDA nanoparticles with various morphologies (Scheme 2). Pluronic polymer (polyoxyethylene–polyoxypropylene–polyoxyethylene, abbreviated as PEO–PPO–PEO) is a type of thermosensitive triblock copolymer composed of hydrophobic and hydrophilic chain segments, facilitating an adjustable shape formation of Pluronic micelles by changing the ratio of P123/F127. Therefore, we were able to adopt Pluronic micelles with different ratios of F127 and P123 to guide the polymerization of dopamine to obtain various morphologies of MPDA nanoparticles. With the increasing content of P123, the size of spherical micelles increases from 5 nm to 30 nm, as verified by the corresponding mesoporous size of PDA nanoparticles (Fig. 1b and c). When the proportion of P123 increased to 50%, the shape of Pluronic micelles transformed from nanosphere to one-dimensional nanorods, resulting in the formation of CPDA. Interestingly, further increasing the percentage of P123 generated two-dimensional Pluronic micelles, BPDA and APDA. In a word, the morphologies of PDA nanoparticles can be adjusted by the ratio of Pluronic micelles. The as-prepared PDA nanoparticles exhibited a uniform size distribution range from 100 to 200 nm, except for agglomerated APDA and BPDA due to their flat morphology. Furthermore, the hydrodynamic diameter and zeta potential of the as-synthesized PDA nanoparticles were determined using a Nano Sizer. The average hydrodynamic diameters of the six different PDA nanoparticles were distributed between 176.3 ± 4.5 nm and 205.7 ± 9.2 nm, which were larger than the diameters in the SEM or TEM images due to the hydration environment.51–54 And the polydispersity index (PDI) of these PDA nanoparticles only ranged from 0.142 ± 0.018 to 0.268 ± 0.015, manifesting the uniformity of these PDA nanoparticles (Fig. 1g). Zeta potential was measured to evaluate the stability of the PDA nanoparticle dispersions. As shown in Fig. 1h, the zeta potentials of the six different PDA nanoparticles were between −32.8 and −26.3 mV, suggesting their high ionization and good dispersion in water. Moreover, the specific surface area (SSA) and pore size were calculated by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) and Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) methods, respectively.55–57 As shown in Fig. 1i and Fig. S2,† compared with the SPDA, the other five PDA nanoparticles displayed significant increases in the SSA because of their porous characteristics. Among them, CPDA showed the highest SSA of 57.1 ± 6.4 m2 g−1, which is almost 13 times higher than that of the SPDA (4.5 ± 0.7 m2 g−1). These nanoparticles also showed a flexible pore size from 5 nm to 31.8 nm, consistent with the results from the SEM and TEM images. The surface composition of the PDA nanoparticles, and the FT-IR and XPS spectra are shown in Fig. S3.†

Radioiodine-labeling assay
To compare the 131I-labeling capacity of various PDA nanoparticles, the iodine-labeling reaction was carried out using the iodogen method. As revealed in Fig. 1j, the highest SSA of CPDA exhibited the highest iodine-labeling rate (88.39% ± 5.17), while the lowest iodine-labeling rate (16.14% ± 4.90) was found in PPDA in spite of its second largest SSA. In contrast, SPDA ranked second in the iodine-labeling rate, however it had the lowest SSA. Taking these results into consideration, we inferred the highest iodine-labeling rate of CPDA may be attributed to their large SSA and cerebriform shape. To be more specific, the ravine structure of CPDA not only provided high active sites (phenolic hydroxyl groups) to conjugate iodine, but also did not impede hydrophobic iodine to substitute the hydrogen proton by the electrophilic substitution reaction. However, the small pores of PPDA were not beneficial for the occurrence of the labeling reaction. Moreover, the iodine-labeling rates of the APDA and BPDA were only 48.16% ± 5.27 and 41.73% ± 6.3, respectively. We thought their aggregation-prone characteristic was an obstacle to the labeling reaction. To quantify their cellular uptake capability, all of the PDA-131I nanoparticles were separately incubated with ATC cell line 8305C cells for 1 h (Fig. 1k). All PDA-131I nanoparticles showed a higher cellular uptake rate than free 131I, mainly attributed to the uptake path of nanoparticles. Among these nanoparticles, CPDA-131I exhibited the highest cellular uptake rate (8.90% ± 0.89), which is approximately 130 times higher than that of free 131I (0.07% ± 0.00). As expected, the lowest iodine-labeling rate of PPDA-131I showed approximately one-tenth cellular uptake rate of CPDA-131I (0.94% ± 0.29). These results demonstrated that the cellular uptake rate of PDA-131I nanoparticles is associated with their iodine-labeling capacity and morphology. Therefore, we believe that the iodine-labeling capacity of nanoparticles can be optimized by morphology control and can thus improve the 131I delivery efficiency to 8305C cells. In addition, CPDA-131I exhibited great radiolabeling stability in PBS and serum after incubation for 7 d (Fig. 1l).

In vitro and in vivo photothermal performance
In order to perform photohyperthermia combined with radiotherapy for ATC, the material should have high photothermal conversion capacity. Therefore, the photothermal conversion experiment for CPDA and SPDA by recording the temperature of deionized water was carried out. As shown in Fig. 2a, the temperature increased with increasing irradiation time. Under irradiation of an 808 nm laser at a density of 1 W cm−2 for 5 min, the maximum temperatures of CPDA and SPDA could reach 59.7 °C and 50.3 °C, respectively (Fig. 2b). Specifically, the temperature change (ΔT) of CPDA was 32.5 °C, 9.3 °C higher than SPDA, as calculated and shown in Fig. 2c. These results suggested that the photothermal conversion efficiency of PDA is greatly improved by changing the morphology and increasing SSA. After turning off the laser, temperatures of the three PDA nanoparticles slowly cooled down to room temperature in 10 min (Fig. 2c). Furthermore, no significant degradation of temperature curves was observed among these PDA nanoparticles throughout five irradiation cycles (Fig. 2d). By plotting the cooling time versus −lnθ, the time constant τs of CPDA and SPDA for photothermal conversion was determined to be 225.9 s and 256.5 s, respectively, based on the linear regression analysis (Fig. 2e). According to the formulas previously reported, the photothermal conversion efficiency (η) of CPDA was calculated to be 50.3%, which is higher than that of SPDA (41.6%). These data demonstrated that CPDA not only has excellent photothermal conversion ability, but also has robust photothermal stability.

In vitro PTT–RT synergistic therapy
Owing to its promising 131I delivery efficiency and excellent photothermal conversion efficiency, CPDA-131I was chosen for further antitumor assays in vitro. As illustrated in Fig. 3a, there was no significant cytotoxicity to L929 cells after treatment with different concentrations of CPDA, even as high as 400 μg mL−1. To evaluate the PTT and RT effect of CPDA-131I, the 8305C cells were treated with CPDA-131I, CPDA + NIR and CPDA-131I + NIR at various concentrations and radioactivity. According to Fig. 3b, single therapy could not effectively inhibit the cell viability even at high radioactivity or concentration with laser irradiation. However, when treated with CPDA-131I + NIR, 8305C cell proliferation was significantly inhibited, suggesting the synergistic effect of PTT and RT. Additionally, the calculated CI value is 0.68, indicating a moderate synergistic effect between the two therapy methods. Calcein-AM and propidium iodide (PI) dual-staining assay was conducted to visualize the 8305C cells being killed by PTT and RT (Fig. 3c). The number of dead cells remarkably increased upon treatment with CPDA-131I + NIR, while more cells survived under the treatment of CPDA-131I or CPDA + NIR. Cells in groups of PBS with or without laser irradiation did not show effective inhibition. DNA double-strand breaks induced by 131I emitted high-energy β rays are primarily responsible for radiation-induced cell apoptosis, which was assessed by staining using a γ-H2AX kit to further evaluate the synergistic effect (Fig. 3d). The groups treated using PBS with or without laser irradiation did not display immunofluorescence signals and were regarded as the control groups. Significant double-strand DNA breaks were induced by CPDA-131I + NIR compared to CPDA-131I or CPDA + NIR. To further confirm whether the cytotoxicity of CPDA-131I nanoparticles with laser irradiation is associated with apoptosis, flow cytometry was carried out and we found that the results of the apoptosis assay were consistent with those obtained using the cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8), calcein-AM/PI and immunofluorescence assays, as shown in Fig. 3e. Taken together, we conclude that a promising ATC cell ablation effect could be achieved by the combination of RT and PTT of CPDA-131I nanoparticles.

SPECT/CT imaging studies and biodistribution and in vivo photothermal performance

125I is often used as a radionuclide imaging agent for SPECT/CT imaging due to its low-energy γ ray emission. Therefore, CPDA-125I nanoparticles were alternatively synthesized to investigate the SPETC/CT imaging of 8305C tumor-bearing mice. A small-animal SPECT/CT system was used to continuously obtain images at various time points (0.5 h, 24 h, 3 d and 7 d) after the injection of 200 μL CPDA-125I (200 μCi). All tumor-bearing mice were fed with cold NaI 2 days before the imaging assay for thyroid blocking. As shown in Fig. 4a, a strong signal was observed in the liver and intestinal tract at 30 min after the intravenous injection, implying that CPDA-125I may have been excreted out by the hepatobiliary system. Subsequently, an obvious tumor uptake of CPDA-125I was observed after 24 h post injection (p.i.), suggesting the efficient passive accumulation of CPDA-125I in tumors by the typical enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. After 7 d, only a weak signal remained in the tumor and liver. To further accurately evaluate the biodistribution of CPDA-131I, the heart, liver, spleen, lungs, kidneys, muscle, skin, bone, brain and tumor were dissected from the mice and the radioactivity was measured using a gamma counter at 24 h after the injection. High radioactivity was detected in the tumor site, in which the radioactivity approached one-third of the liver uptake (Fig. 4b). In addition, the blood circulation of CPDA-131I was also evaluated using a gamma counter. We found that the pharmacokinetics of CPDA-131I were consistent with those of a two-compartment model. The half-lives of the first and second phase in blood circulation were determined to be 0.53 ± 0.47 h and 9.86 ± 3.58 h, respectively (Fig. 4c). These results indicated that iodine-labeled CPDA nanoparticles could passively accumulate in the tumor with high radioactivity through the EPR effect. Motivated by the excellent photothermal conversion efficiency of the CPDA nanoparticles in vitro, the PTT effect in vivo was further evaluated. 200 μL of PBS and CPDA (1 mg mL−1) were injected intravenously into the 8305C tumor-bearing mice via their tail vein, and were then treated using an 808 nm laser (1 W cm−2) after 24 h for 5 min, and continuous thermographs of the mice were obtained using a thermal infrared camera. As shown in Fig. 4d, the treatment of CPDA + NIR could heat the tumor tissue rapidly 6 h after the injection. The temperature reached nearly 50 °C in 5 min, which was much higher than that of PBS + NIR (Fig. 4e). These results were consistent with the experiments in vitro, suggesting that the CPDA nanoparticles are a type of reliable and efficient photothermal reagent in vitro and in vivo.

In vivo antitumor activity
The excellent SPECT/CT imaging and biodistribution outcomes encouraged us to further investigate the therapy effect of CPDA-131I for the integration of PTT and RT in vivo. 8305C tumor-bearing nude mice were randomly divided into five groups (n = 5) and treated with PBS, PBS + NIR, CPDA-131I, CPDA + NIR and CPDA-131I + NIR (Fig. 5a). As shown in Fig. 5b, all mice did not show a decreasing tendency of body weight after the 22 d treatment. The tumor growth was significantly inhibited in the group of CPDA-131I + NIR, and a single treatment of CPDA + NIR or CPDA-131I showed a markedly slower growth rate of the tumor than that of PBS or PBS + NIR (Fig. S4† and Fig. 5c–e). Furthermore, the tumor size did not increase anymore after being treated with CPDA-131I + NIR, mainly attributed to the synergistic effect of PTT and RT on the 8305C tumors. The pathological changes and apoptosis level in the tumors were further verified by hematoxylin & eosin (H&E) staining and the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay. The results revealed that the combination of PTT and RT displayed the greatest cytotoxicity to 8305C cells in vivo by inducing apoptosis (Fig. 5f). To evaluate the potential toxicity of CPDA-131I to the non-tumor tissues, the main organs (lungs, liver, spleen, heart and kidneys) were eviscerated from the 8305C tumor-bearing mice after 22 d, and then stained with H&E. Compared with the control groups, the treated groups exhibited no significant pathological changes (Fig. S5†). Considering the components of CPDA-131I, dopamine is one of the most abundant catecholaminergic neurotransmitters in the brain, and 131I is widely used in the clinic, both holding good physical safety. Therefore, different radioisotope (131I and 125I)-labeled CPDA have great potential to be developed as ATC theranostic nanoplatforms with high biosafety.

Conclusions
In summary, we successfully synthesized novel PDA nanoparticles (SPDA, PPDA, MPDA, CPDA, BPDA and APDA) with various morphologies and they were used as nanocarriers for ATC theranostics in SPECT/CT imaging guided combined RT and PTT. These PDA nanoparticles were labeled with 131I by the iodogen method. Among them, CPDA-131I nanoparticles with a high specific area and cerebriform morphology were the most promising agents for the combination of PTT and RT, and show high photothermal conversion efficiency, iodine-labeling efficiency and good stability. Such CPDA-131I nanoparticles exhibited an extra impressive synergistic therapy effect on 8305C tumors in vitro and in vivo compared with PTT or RT alone. Additionally, CPDA-125I can be utilized to obtain clear SPETC/CT images of tumors and thus guide PTT and RT. Moreover, no obvious cellular toxicity of CPDA-131I was observed, confirming their great biocompatibility. Therefore, we concluded that these radioiodine-labeled CPDA nanoparticles warrant further exploration of SPECT/CT guided photothermal–radio therapy of ATC in clinical practice.

 	Scheme 2  Schematic illustration of the synthesis and mechanism of the PDA nanoparticles with various morphologies: smooth polydopamine nanoparticles (SPDA), polyporous polydopamine nanoparticles (PPDA), macroporous polydopamine nanoparticles (MPDA), cerebroid polydopamine nanoparticles (CPDA), bowl-shaped polydopamine nanoparticles (BPDA), acetabuliform polydopamine nanoparticles (APDA).	 

 	Fig. 1  SEM images of (a–f) SPDA, PPDA, MPDA, CPDA, BPDA and APDA. (g) Hydrodynamic sizes (n = 3), polydispersity index (PDI) and (h) zeta potential of various PDA nanoparticles (n = 3). (i) Specific surface area (n = 3) and (j) 131I labeling rate of various PDA nanoparticles (n = 3). (k) Cell uptake of various PDA-131I nanoparticles and free 131I (n = 3). (l) 131I labeled stability of various PDA in PBS (1 mM, pH 7.4) or fetal bovine serum at 37 °C.	 

 	Fig. 2  (a) Thermal images of CPDA and SPDA (400 μg mL−1) under laser irradiation. (b) Real-time temperature of CPDA and SPDA under the irradiation of an 808 nm laser at a density of 1 W cm−2 for 5 min. (c) Temperature changes (ΔT) of CPDA and SPDA (400 μg mL−1) under laser irradiation for 5 minutes and natural cooling for 10 min. (d) Recycling heating profile for 5 times. (e) Plot of the cooling time vs. −lnθ.	 

 	Fig. 3  (a) Cytotoxicity of CPDA at various concentrations to L929 cells (n = 3 each group). (b) Cell viability of 8305C cells after being treated with various doses of CPDA-131I, CPDA + NIR and CPDA-131I + NIR (NIR: 808 nm laser, 1 W cm−2, 5 min) (n = 3 each group; ***P < 0.001). (c) Calcein AM/PI co-staining images, (d) confocal fluorescence images of nuclear DNA fragmentation stained with γ-H2AX and (e) the flow cytometry data for the apoptosis of 8305C cells induced by PBS, PBS + NIR, CPDA-131I, CPDA + NIR and CPDA-131I + NIR. Dots at the lower left and right represent the living and early apoptotic cells, while at the upper right and left represent the cells in the late apoptotic and necrotic states.	 

 	Fig. 4  (a) SPECT/CT images of 8305C tumor-bearing mice at various time points after intravenous injection with CPDA-125I; the tumors sites were circled by white dots. (b) Biodistribution (n = 3) and (c) blood circulation profiles of CPDA-125I in various organs measured at 24 h post injection (n = 3). (d) Infrared thermal images in vivo and (e) the temperature curves of the tumor sites after being intravenously injected with PBS and CPDA and then irradiated using an 808 nm laser at 1 W cm−2 for 5 min (n = 3).	 

 	Fig. 5  (a) Dosage regimen of the in vivo treatment for 22 days. (b) Relative body weight of the 8305C tumor-bearing mice treated with PBS, PBS + NIR, CPDA-131I, CPDA + NIR and CPDA-131I + NIR (n = 5; *P < 0.05). (c) Digital photographs, (d) relative volume (n = 5; *P < 0.05 and **P < 0.01) and (e) relative weight of the tumors eviscerated from the mice after treatment (n = 5; *P < 0.05 and ***P < 0.001). (f) H&E and TUNEL images of the tumor tissues in all groups, and * means P < 0.05; scale bars: 100 μm.
