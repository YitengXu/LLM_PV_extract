A Introduction
Description of thin film Li-ion microbatteries
The spectacular development of on-board solutions for electronic devices and microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) has enhanced the race towards the miniaturization of low power sources at the micrometre scale. Particularly, the fabrication of rechargeable microbatteries has opened interesting perspectives for a large number of applications, which is associated with a strong economical impact. Actually, the continuous demand of very small power sources has triggered the market of microbatteries. According to nanomarket experts,1 the world market of microbatteries is really promising and is predicted to reach $5.6 billion in 2015.
Although the industry of microbatteries has several challenges to overcome, such as the competition with low-priced conventional button/coin batteries, many benefits are driving their development. Compared to several millimetres for button batteries, the thickness of a microbattery lies in the micrometre range. In general, all-solid-state microbatteries reveal long lives, robust rechargeability, have less potential to threaten the environment (e.g. Sony's laptop battery troubles in 2006) and can be fabricated in any size or shape on different substrates including semiconductors, ceramics, and plastics. The highest potential market demand covers four general types of applications: real time clocking (RTC), Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) and smart packaging, sensors, and smartcards. The domains of applications cover also energy storage for solar cells and harvesting devices, medical and cosmetic devices, memory backup power, etc. With advantages in manufacturing, robustness, and environmental issues, microbatteries are suited for many large-volume existing and emerging applications. Their long-term potential is quite impressive.
The conventional Li-ion microbatteries are composed of stacking layers obtained by thin film deposition technologies. Most of the thin films are deposited in vacuum chambers by Radio-Frequency2–4 (RF) and Direct Current5 (DC) magnetron sputtering, by flash and thermal evaporation,6,7 and by pulsed laser ablation.8 Other physical and chemical vapor deposition processes, such as pulsed laser deposition,9,10 electron cyclotron resonance sputtering, and aerosol flame coating,11 have been also investigated to deposit some battery components. Wet process techniques have been also reported including sol–gel methods,12,13 electrochemical techniques14 and liquid source misted chemical deposition.15 The design of a typical microbattery is depicted in Fig. 1a. It consists of two electrodes (electronic conductors) separated by a solid electrolyte (ionic conductor), two current collectors (e.g.Al thin films) and a protective coating. The thickness of the full stack is 1–10 µm (see e.g.ref. 16–24). It can be noticed that the battery can be flexible if the substrate is thin (see Fig. 1b).
 Fig. 1  Schematic of a thin film microbattery (a) and an example of flexible microbattery (courtesy of HEF) (b). 
The operating system of the most simple thin film microbattery is comparable to a regular Li-ion battery. During discharge, due to the difference in the electrochemical potential between the metallic Li (anode) and the intercalation compound (cathode) the oxidation of Li occurs according to eqn (1). Then, Li+ ions migrate from the anode to the cathode noted A by diffusing through the solid electrolyte leading to the formation of LixA according to the reduction reaction (lithiation) given in eqn (2). Li = Li+ + e−(1) A + xLi+ + xe− = LixA(2)
At steady state, the battery can be recharged by reversing current. This operation corresponds to the reversed eqn (1) and (2). Generally, recharge of a thin film battery is achieved at constant voltage or by applying low currents (<1 µA cm−2). The cell voltage is related to the difference of the electrochemical potential of the electrodes and the performances of the cells depend strongly on the both electrodes and electrolyte properties. In order to minimize capacity fading, the intercalation compounds must be able to accommodate reversibly a high number of Li ions and support the subsequent volume variation due to the insertion/extraction of Li during cycling. Last but not least, reducing the footprint of the devices requires also the shrinkage of the microbattery dimensions while improving the performances. This can be achieved by two different approaches: fabricate a stack of microbatteries connected in parallel or increase the area of the active structures by using 3D nano-architectured electrodes.
Developments of thin film microbatteries
The initial active research on thin film electrochemical systems started with the development of solid electrolytes. As for conventional electrochemical cells, the electrolyte must be stable and support sufficient current density during both charge and discharge. For this, fast migration of Li ions into the electrolyte during cycling is ensured by a relatively high ionic conductivity while the electronic conductivity should be low in order to avoid the short circuit. Among the first solid state cells reported, the Li/Li3N/LiCF3SO3–(PEO)9/TiS2 configuration was cycled in the temperature range 120–170 °C.25 This was followed by the remarkable method of using Li ion conductive sulfide glasses and mixed conductive glasses as electrolyte and cathode material.26,27
The next work came out with the use of radio-frequency sputtered titanium oxy-sulfide films as positive electrodes and ternary sputtered oxide glass (B2O3–Li2O–Li2SO4) as electrolyte whereas the evaporated lithium was used as negative electrode.28,29 But the above models of micro-batteries still lacked high current density and good cycling performance. Although there was an ample number of previous researches on thin film microbatteries, the real evolution of rechargeable thin film lithium ion batteries started with the development of a thin-film solid-state Li/TiS2 microbattery.30 This kind of microbattery is fabricated using the sputtering technique for deposition of the metal contacts, TiS2 cathode, and oxide/sulfide glassy electrolyte. The LiI layer and Li anode are deposited by high vacuum evaporation. The function of LiI is to prevent the formation of Li2S due to the reaction of Li with the electrolyte. This microelectrochemical cell is characterized by a voltage of 2.5 V, an energy density of 140 Wh L−1 and a power density of 270 W L−1, can deliver a current density of 4 A m−2, and can be cycled over 1000 times at close to 100% positive electrode efficiency. Then, other works dealing with the fabrication of full thin film cells have been reported.31,32
With many advantages such as an ionic transport number equal to 1, an electrochemical window enhanced to 5.5 V vs.Li+/Li, and a high resistivity of about 1014 Ω cm,33LiPON (lithium phosphorus oxynitride) is the most widely used solid electrolyte for microbatteries. This thin film solid electrolyte developed in the early 1990s by Bates at Oak Ridge National Laboratory is obtained by RF magnetron sputtering from a Li3PO4 ceramic target and nitrogen gas used to form the plasma.16,34–36LiPON can be also deposited by alternative techniques such as ion beam-directed assembly deposition.37 Due to the good properties of LiPON associated with the uniform current and charge distribution of thin films, which are able to accommodate volume changes, all-solid-state microbatteries with different positive and negative electrodes can perform hundreds of deep cycles with little loss of capacity. Several other materials have been investigated and can be also good candidates including inorganic glasses based on binary and ternary systems of Li borate, phosphate, silicate, and vanadate, glass-ceramics, and polymer electrolytes (see e.g.ref. 38).
Compared with ordinary Li-ion batteries, thin film electrodes used for micro-power sources are without additives or binders. In general, the films are homogenous, crystalline, and dense. The most encountered positive electrodes are Li based oxides including LiCoO2,39,40LiMn2O4,15,41LiNiVO442 thin films as well as TiOySz,43,44V2O5,45,46 and some other compounds that can be amorphous or nanocrystalline.47–50,51 Concerning the negative electrodes, simple metallic Li thin films can be used as anode and current collectors. Although the operating temperature of the resulting electrochemical cell is limited to 180 °C because of the low melting point of Li, the charge–discharge cycling at high rate over hundreds of cycles without formation of Li dendrites can be achieved when LiPON is used as solid electrolyte. Furthermore, the fabrication of Li-free thin films showing good electrochemical performances over cycling has been explored and reported for pure metals (e.g.Sn and Zn), for alloys,52 chemical compounds of the IV column (e.g. C, Si, and Ge) as well as for oxide, nitride, and oxynitride53,54–56).
Negative electrodes based on titania materials

          TiO2: an alternative anode for Li-ion batteries
Since Macklin and Neat57 reported the high capacity and reversibility of lithium insertion into titanium oxide electrodes in lithium batteries, a considerable research effort has been aimed at optimizing and understanding the titanium dioxide negative electrode.58–60 Among all polymorphs of titania, it has been reported that the anatase structure is a potential candidate as negative electrode due to the good lithium intercalation behaviour61 associated to enhanced safety, low self-discharge, good capacity retention on cycling and high power. Indeed, TiO2 is a possible alternative for the graphite negative electrode for certain applications, because of higher potential operation (approx. 1.75 V vs.Li+/Li redox couple). This eliminates the risk of lithium dendrites formation and growth in the case of overcharging. As a matter of fact, graphite and other carbonaceous materials are known to be notoriously prone to lithium electrodeposition due to their very low insertion potential (less than 0.1 V vs.Li+/Li). Even a slight overcharge can lead to lithium dendrite formation, a situation that may easily lead to short circuits and to catastrophic destruction of the cell. The risk of Li electrodeposition leads the manufacturers to implement costly electronic and mechanical safeties in every battery produced. In contrast, the potential of the Li+ insertion reaction into TiO2 is well within the electrochemical stability window of most electrolytes used in Li-ion cells and it is expected that a passive layer or SEI (Solid Electrolyte Interphase) would not form on the surface of such an electrode by reduction of the electrolyte. Hence, the irreversible capacity due to formation of the passive layer can be avoided, as the passive layer (SEI) would be very thin or inexistent. Without the passive layer, the overall electrode kinetics should improve as there are no diffusion penalties introduced by a thick SEI.
It has been found that titanium dioxide is able to insert reversibly Li ions according to eqn (3). TiO2 + xLi+ + xe− = LixTiO2(3)

          Insertion of Li+ ions into the crystalline anatase phase is possible up to 0.5 Li per Ti reaching a theoretical capacity value of 168 mA h g−1.62 The anatase phase has a tetragonal structure described by the space groupI41/amd, in which titanium is surrounded by a distorted oxygen octahedron. Between the TiO6 octahedra, there are vacant octahedral and tetrahedral sites within which Li+ can be accommodated. The electrochemical insertion of lithium ions takes place through a two-phase equilibrium of a Li-poor (tetragonal) and a Li-rich (orthorhombic) phase.63–66 It is worth noting that the orthorhombic phase formation is due to the accommodation of the charge injected in the same time with Li+ insertion into localized Ti-d orbitals with the occupation of degenerate orbitals above a critical intercalation concentration resulting in a cooperative Jahn–Teller-like distortion of the lattice.
Enhanced electrochemical performances of nanostructured titania electrodes
In general, the fabrication of nanostructured electrodes seems to be one of the most promising tracks for improving the performances of power sources. Particularly, intensive researches have been conducted to find alternatives to carbonaceous negative electrodes.67,68 Nanomaterial-based electrodes mitigate the rate-limiting effects of sluggish electron-kinetics and mass-transport. The large surface area of nanomaterials serves to distribute the current density improving charge transfer kinetics, while the small size ensures that intercalation sites reside close to the surface. Improvement of rate capability, capacity and cycling behaviour has been observed in the case of nanostructured titania, strengthening the possibility to use this oxide as a negative material for traditional Li-ion batteries. Bruce and Lyndsay have reported that the crystallite size and shape play key roles for improving the performances of the electrodes.69,70 It can also be noted that their investigation concerned either hydrothermally synthesized TiO2 nanotubes or anodic oxide thin films. None of these two materials are actually organized, but they rather consist of a collection of objects with random orientations.
Very recently, batteries based on 3D microstructures are shown to offer significant advantages such as small footprint and short diffusion lengths.71 Different 3D designs have opened the path towards the fabrication of high performance microbatteries based on interdigitated micro- and nano-architectured electrodes.72 One of the most spectacular examples of taking the advantages of such 3D electrodes has been reported by Simon et al.73 In this approach, electrodeposition of active negative material has been performed onto current collectors constituted by copper nanopillars. They have clearly demonstrated that kinetic limitations encountered in the case of conventional electrodes can be tackled by designing such highly nanostructured electrodes. So far, the fabrication of 3D electrodes at the sub-micrometre scale can be achieved by combining top down techniques that have been developed in microelectronics (especially optical and electronic microlithographic techniques) or by using bottom-up approaches based on self-assembly processes. By self-assembly techniques it is possible to fabricate nanotubes, rods and fibres that present the same orientations over large areas. The best known self-assembled material is anodic alumina oxide (AAO) that forms regular arrays of highly parallel pores.74 The self-assembly phenomenon occurs when the growing nanostructures (tubes, wires) are able to interact between themselves. In the case of electrochemical processes this interaction can be mediated by the electrical field or by the diffusion layer. The interaction has to have a certain degree of symmetry whenever regular arrays of structures are obtained. In other words, the growth of self-assembled structures is synchronous and directional due to not negligible interactions between adjacent structures. Particularly, the electrochemical self-assembly mechanism is able to select and promote the growth of nanostructures that have their dimensions confined within a certain range depending on the electrochemical parameters.
The synthesis of self-assembled nanostructures provides materials presenting strong anisotropies and hence new properties over a large macroscopic surface. The self-assembly method is desirable for reasons of simplicity and cost while the dimensions of the nanostructures (pores, tubes, wires) can be usually tuned by adjusting the synthesis parameters.
Electrochemical fabrication of self-organized titania nanotubes
From nanoporous to self-organized titania nanotubes
The properties of TiO2 electrodes are known to improve dramatically when this material is in a porous form that presents a large specific surface area. The exciting properties exhibited by self-organized TiO2 nanotube layers such as homogeneous controllable porosity and tube length in conjunction with its large spectrum of potential applications and the relatively simple and inexpensive electrochemical preparation have attracted the interest of researchers.75–82 An early report83 demonstrated that the anodization of Ti foils in fluoride-containing medium leads to porous nanostructured titania. Then, Zwilling et al.75 first fabricated a porous anodic titanium oxide layer showing a columnar structure. Since then, self-organized tubular oxide layers formed by anodization have been achieved for several valve metals and their alloys. Under specific anodic conditions, in fluoride containing electrolytes, self-assembled arrays of oxide nanotubes can be grown on Zr,84–86 W,87,88Hf,89Nb, Ti90,91 and Ti-based biomedical alloys.92,93
More recently, the nanotubular titanium oxide (TiO2nt) produced by anodization has gained significant attention as a material with increased versatility. These highly ordered TiO2 nanotubes have already shown high photoelectrochemical performance under UV and visible light.94–98 They were successfully used to design dye-sensitised solar cells,76,99–102 to perform the photocleavage of water103–105 and were doped with nitrogen,106,107carbon108 and chromium109 which modified the band gap and improved the photoelectrochemical response and other electronic properties.110,111 The titanium oxide nanotubes show ultra-high hydrogen gas sensitivity112 with direct applications in gas sensors.113 The tubes also exhibit strong electrochromic behaviour with respect to H+114 and Li+115insertion. Nanostructured titania116 has very recently re-emerged as a possible negative material in Li-ion batteries58 showing a high rate capability, competitive capacity and good cycling behaviour. Catalysis117 and photocatalysis,77,118fuel cells,119,120 biological and biomedical applications121,122 are currently being pioneered in several research groups. It is possible to tune the nanotube wetting properties,123,124 to adjust the tube geometry125,126 and to produce different morphologies127 by changing the electrochemical parameters. As a function of the anodization conditions, diameters may vary between 30 and 200 nm while lengths can be adjusted between 200 nm and 1000 µm when working in non-aqueous electrolytes.128,129 Needless to say that such nanostructured materials with tuneable aspect ratios are much desired for engineering purposes and development. The fact that TiO2 self-assembled nanotube arrays can be prepared on Si wafers130–132 constitutes another important asset of these materials opening the path towards on-chip integration of many of the applications mentioned above.
However, although the research on self-assembled nanotubular oxide layers has already yielded an avalanche of published applications, the research is still in an incipient phase and very few of the fundamental aspects and research paths are covered so far. In fact, it can be noticed that most of the research efforts are focused on the nanotubular TiO2 intrinsic properties. For instance, very few attempts have been made so far to fill the tubes or deposit different materials upon the tubes133–135 although this might lead to even more interesting nanomaterials and nanostructures produced by novel synthesis routes.
Principle and formation mechanism of self-organized TiO2nt
Self-organized titania nanotubes can be fabricated by a simple anodization treatment in HF-containing electrolytes. The resulting morphology and the chemical properties of these nanomaterials depend on the electrochemical parameters, such as the nature of substrate, the anodization conditions and the chemical composition of the electrolyte. Titania nanotubes can be obtained directly by anodization of mirror polished Ti foil or sputtered thin films in 1 M H3PO4, 1 M NaOH and 0.5 wt% HF.132 In the latter case, the sequence starts with deposition of a 2 µm thick Ti film on an n-type Si (100) wafer by cathodic sputtering using a DC triode system. At room temperature, the resulting sputtered Ti thin film shows a columnar morphology and can be anodized. The potentiostatic treatment performed at 20 V for 20 min in a HF-containing electrolyte leads to the formation of TiO2 nanotubes characterized by an average length of 600 nm, a diameter between 80 and 150 nm, and a wall thickness of 20 nm. Fig. 2a shows SEM images (cross-section) of TiO2nt obtained after anodization. Depending on the nature of the electrolyte it is also possible to modify the morphology of the tubes (see TiO2 formed in ethylene glycol-containing electrolyte shown in Fig. 2b). It has to be noted that surface analysis measurements performed by Energy Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy (EDX) and X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) revealed that the nanotubes are consisting of amorphous TiO2. Anatase TiO2nt can be formed after a thermal treatment at 450 °C in air for 3 hours.

The nanotube formation involves oxide growth at the metal surface, metal ion migration from the metal at the metal/oxide interface and field-assisted dissolution of the oxide at the oxide/electrolyte interface.137–141 The oxide growth at the metal surface is due to interaction of the metal with O2− or OH− ions.142 This is followed by the migration of anions through the oxide layer and reaching the metal/oxide interface. Due to the electric field, the cations (Ti4+) move from metal/oxide interface to the oxide/electrolyte interface. This leads to the dissolution of the oxide at the oxide/electrolyte interface. This field assisted process favors effective dissolution of oxide. Ti–O bonds undergo polarization and there is dissolution of the metal cations into the electrolyte due to the weakening of the bonds. Now free O2− ions move to the oxide/electrolyte interface to react with the metal.143
Several studies on TiO2 nanotube formation78,144 have shown that oxide nanotubes grow as a result of a competition between electrochemical oxide formation and chemical dissolution of oxide by the action of fluoride ions according to the eqn (4) and (5): Ti + 2H2O = TiO2 + 4H+ + 4e−(4) TiO2 + 4H+ + 6F− = [TiF6]2− + 2H2O(5)

Fig. 3 depicts the most probable sequence of nanotube growth in the presence of water. In the first stage a compact oxide layer grows fast on the surface. Some studies suggest that the initial oxide layer exists as TiO2−n(OH)2n. However, this formula should not be understood as a compound having this stoichiometry but rather as a mixture of TiO2 and Ti(OH)4. It is known that in the presence of water, titanium metal is covered by a hydrated layer containing Ti(OH)4. It might be possible that the composition of the initial barrier layer has a significant influence upon the subsequent development of the oxide layer.
 Fig. 3  Schematic representation of the TiO2 nanotube formation: (a) compact oxide layer growth, (b) breakdown of the barrier layer, (c) initial growth of pores resulting in a wormlike structure, (d) ordered structure still covered with the thinning initial layer, and (e) regular self-organised nanotubular TiO2 structure. 
The presence of F− ions induces the localized breakdown of the barrier layer, starting on the pre-existent defect sites. SEM investigations show that the breakdown sites are randomly distributed and there is no sign of self-organization at this stage (Fig. 3a). These sites act as nucleation points of a disordered wormlike structure (Fig. 3b and c). According to eqn (4) a pH gradient builds up between the open top and the bottom of the pore. As the pH is lower at the bottom of the pore the dissolution rate of the TiO2 becomes higher at the bottom according to eqn (5).
The mechanism of self-organization was proposed by Yasuda et al.145 By a natural selection process self-organization of the pores takes place and an ordered array of pores is generated (Fig. 3d).
During anodization the acidic conditions at the bottom of the pores are maintained and the pores grow to the maximum length allowed by the fluoride ion concentration. The initial barrier layer is steadily dissolved and during the growth of the tubes by the same chemical process given by eqn (4). This is a rather slow process as it is not enhanced by the autocatalytic effect that leads to local acidification at the bottom of the pores. However, by the end of the anodization this layer is etched away by chemical dissolution making the underneath highly ordered array of TiO2 nanotubes observable from the top (Fig. 3e). The combination of these steps results in the self-organization of the pores. The autocatalysis system was already reported by Macak et al..78 A remarkable feature about nanotubes growth is that the oxide structure originating from the wormlike porous structure changes into a nanotube morphology by formation of gaps between the tubes. If gaps are not produced, the structure is not tubular but a hexagonally arranged hole-array as in the case of AAO (Anodic Alumina Oxide) membranes. One of the main factors for the generation of gaps is the mechanical stress in the oxide tubes. It was found that the main process inducing mechanical stress during anodization is the volume expansion when the metal phase is converted to the oxide phase.146
Electrochemical fabrication of metallic nanowires from self-organized titania nanotubes
Investigating template-free approaches while controlling the size and the shape of the nanostructures is still challenging. Among all recent techniques that have been explored for the fabrication of vertical nano-objects, the electrochemical deposition process is strongly emerging because of significant technical and economical advantages such as simplicity, low-cost, and even more important the ability to be performed at low temperature and in different media. See e.g.: the electrochemical synthesis of ZnO nanowire arrays.147
The formation of tin nanowires (Snnw) by electrodeposition on self-organized titania nanotubes has been previously reported by our group79,148 and it is based on a two-step electrochemical process. The first step is the anodic growth of self-organized TiO2 nanotubes from sputtered Ti thin film132 while the second step is the galvanostatic electrodeposition of vertical Sn nanocrystallites using the nanotubular TiO2 layer as substrate. The electrode used for electrodeposition has a capital influence on the morphology of the Sn deposit. The nanowire morphology is only obtained when the deposition is performed on a nanotube surface. On a compact titania layer only large crystallites without any particular orientation were observed showing that nanotube thin films can be used as seed layer for guiding the growth of Sn nanowires.145,146 This situation is clearly illustrated by the SEM images shown in Fig. 4.

SEM cross-sectional views of Sn crystallites electrochemically grown onto (a) thin compact TiO2 film and (b) TiO2 nanotube layer. The morphology and the density of Sn crystallites are strongly modified by the presence of the nanotubes leading to the formation of nanowires.149 
Compared to conventional techniques employed for the fabrication of nanowires, this alternative template approach shows two main differences: subsequent dissolution of the titania template after deposition of Sn is not needed and properties of the Sn nanowires can be monitored by electrodeposition parameters. This first work has also shown that the properties of Sn nanowires in terms of morphology and density can be controlled by electrodeposition parameters and the chemical composition of the electrolyte.149 For instance, a relatively low applied current density can limit the contribution of the coalescence phenomenon leading to the formation of nanowires with a homogeneous size distribution. As it is shown in Fig. 5, under optimized conditions the large majority of the deposit consists of nanowires that can be up to 2.5 µm long with a diameter below 300 nm.

SEM tilted view of Sn nanowires prepared in 0.036 M SnCl2 + 0.05 M Na3C6H5O7·2H2O by applying a current density of −2.5 mA cm−2 for 3 min.79 
The formation of Sn crystallites revealing a whisker-like structure can also be found in the literature—see e.g.ref. 150 and 151—but most of the efforts contributed to suppress this undesired morphology in order to produce homogeneous Sn thin films for protection applications.152–155 Thus, the mechanism of dendrites formation under different electrochemical conditions has been the subject of intense investigations.156–158 The preferred orientation growth of Sn crystallites encountered here could be attributed to a “tip-effect” leading to a very high current density at the top part of the Sn nuclei. This localized current density could enhance drastically the growth of dendritic crystallites resulting in the formation of wires.
The ability to use TiO2nt to guide the vertical growth of metallic crystallites has also been reported for the electrochemical fabrication of Fe nanowires.159Fig. 6 shows a cross-sectional SEM image of Fe2O3 nanowires grown onto TiO2nt obtained after thermal treatment at 500 °C in air for 5 hours.

Electrochemical performance of electrodes composed of self-organized TiO2nt
Pure TiO2nt as anode for Li-ion microbatteries
Very recently, we have reported for the first time the ability to use an alternative Li-ion battery electrode based on self-organized TiO2nt thin films produced by anodization of Ti foil.160 From Fig. 7, the electrochemical performance of a half-cell using TiO2nt as a positive electrode and Li as a negative electrode is clearly better than that of a compact TiO2 thin film. A higher specific capacity is obtained with as-prepared TiO2nt layers using a relative slow kinetic (5 µA cm−2), which delivered a maximum reversible capacity of 77 µA h cm−2 and 55 µA h cm−2 after 50 cycles. The average capacity loss of 0.45 µA h cm−2 per cycle leads to a cycling efficiency of 71% (efficiency is defined by ratio between the capacities of first and last reversible discharge). Compared with other thin film-based electrodes that have been reported in the literature (e.g. MoS2-based planar Li-ion battery161), these results show that TiO2nt thin films can be utilized as a potential negative electrode for a complete system.

From Fig. 8, it is remarkable that the nanotubular morphology withstands 50 cycles without any damage confirming that this geometry is particularly suited to buffer the unavoidable volume variations upon cycling.

SEM image the TiO2nt layer stopped at 2.6 V in the charged state (delithiated state) after 50 cycles.162 
Since the anodic TiO2nt is relevant for on chip Li-ion microbattery applications, electrochemical characterization of TiO2nt grown onto Si was also explored.
The galvanostatic discharge/charge curves vs. composition of the electrodes on Si substrates using a kinetic of 5 µA cm−2 are shown in Fig. 9.

For TiO2nt annealed at 450 °C (Fig. 9a), the presence of two plateaus at 1.75 V during the discharge and at 1.95 V during the charge is attributed to the insertion and deinsertion of Li, respectively. According to the literature, the electrochemical insertion of lithium ions into crystalline anatase takes place through a two-phase equilibrium of a Li-poor (tetragonal) and a Li-rich (orthorhombic) phase63–66 that can be easily identified by the presence of a potential plateau on galvanostatic curves. A total capacity of 165 µA h cm−2 was obtained in the first discharge, which includes reversible and irreversible reactions. The first reversible capacity obtained in the second discharge was 76 µA h cm−2, which corresponds to a nominal composition of Li0.95TiO2. A similar composition up to Li0.91TiO2 has been reported for TiO2–B nanowires.116,163,164
The galvanostatic curves shown in Fig. 9b obtained for amorphous TiO2nt do not present a readily identifiable plateau. Such behaviour is consistent with the lithiation occurring through a monophasic mechanism. A phase transition does not occur in the process and hence a gradual decrease of the electrode potential with lithiation is observed. Thus, this material can be considered as a solid solution, such as MnO2 with respect to H+ and Li+ insertion. The total capacity in the first discharge (196 µA h cm−2) and the first reversible capacity (89 µA h cm−2) are higher than that for a crystalline structure. This corresponds to a nominal composition of Li1.1TiO2. The relatively high irreversible capacity can be attributed to different phenomena. A side reaction can occur with water molecules according to eqn (6): H2O + Li+ + e− = LiOH + 1/2H2(6)
Moreover, some lithium irreversibly trapped in the TiO2nt structure may contribute to the irreversible capacity as well as the formation of a very thin passive film (SEI) at the electrode.
Composite TiO2nt-oxide nanowires as negative electrode for Li-ion microbatteries
Recently, a new generation of negative electrodes based on conversion reactions has emerged. Unfortunately, the resulting enhanced capacity is shadowed by slow kinetics, low diffusion coefficient of Li+, and/or poor electronic conductivity of the active materials. The use of 3D nanoarchitectured electrodes can tackle most of these drawbacks.

Tin oxide-based Li-ion microbatteries have emerged as a new microscale technology since the concept of a “rocking-chair-type” rechargeable battery was developed in 1990.165,166 Particularly, SnO can accommodate a large amount of Li ions according to eqn (7) and (8): SnO + 2Li+ + 2e− = Li2O + Sn(7) Sn + xLi+ + xe− = LixSn (0 < x < 4.4)(8)
During the discharge, tin oxide is electrochemically reduced, resulting in the formation of nanosized tin clusters surrounded by Li2O particles. Afterward, the metallic tin reacts with lithium, forming alloys.167–169 However, a major drawback of tin-based electrodes is the giant volume change on lithium insertion/deinsertion that leads to cracks in the particles with subsequent electric contact loss thus rendering the material electrochemically inactive. The electrochemical behaviour of tin during cycling is generally poor. A potential solution is to embed the active tin-based negative electrode material in a matrix to buffer the volume variation170–172 or to use nanostructured active material.173,174 The preparation of new forms of tin-based materials with tailored particle size, morphology, crystallinity and confinement of tin species in different matrixes defines the current paths that are being followed for alleviating the above-mentioned undesirable effects. For instance, tin-based materials are prepared using sophisticated matrices.175–179 In this context, the possibility to use composite TiO2nt–SnOnw has also been reported. For this, the electrodeposited Sn nanowires grown from TiO2nt previously described have been oxidized by thermal treatment at 350 °C for 3 hours in air (Fig. 10).

The electrochemical performance of composite TiO2nt–Sn based electrodes is strongly correlated with the 3D design of the anode. Compared with both composite compact TiO2–SnO and TiO2nt–Snnw, the areal capacity of TiO2nt–SnOnw is stable with small fading over 50 cycles180 as shown in Fig. 11.

Iron oxides have been recently identified as another conversion materials exhibiting attractive capacities. Particularly, α-Fe2O3 is able to accommodate Li ions according to eqn (9): Fe2O3 + 6Li+ + 6e− = 2Fe + 3Li2O(9)
The electrochemical performance of nanocomposite Fe2O3nw–TiO2nt shown in Fig. 6 has also been studied.159 It is demonstrated that the presence of iron oxide increases significantly the capacity values as compared with pure titania nanotubes. Apparently, the combination of 1D nanostructures (i.e.nanotubes and nanowires morphologies) exhibits better capacity retention that can be explained by the capability of the electrode to buffer the volume variation upon cycling. Compared to other thin layer-based electrodes that have been reported, e.g., a Si-based Li-ion battery (90 µA h cm−2 at 12 µA cm−2 for 0.5 µm layer thickness),181 a carbon micro-net film (150 µA h cm−2 at 6 µA cm−2 of about 4 µm thick),182 and Fe3O4 thin films electrodeposited on copper plate (about 300 µA h cm−2 at 10 µA cm−2, and 130 µA h cm−2 at 1C rate),183 the 3 µm thick nanocomposite electrode based on iron oxide nanowires/titania nanotubes described here shows areal capacities of 468 µA h cm−2 (1st reversible discharge) and 200 µA h cm−2 over 45 cycles at 25 µA cm−2 or 1C rate (Fig. 12). To our knowledge, the areal capacity is the highest ever reported suggesting that this electrode may be a potential material for the fabrication of microbatteries. Additionally, another interesting feature of this nanocomposite electrode is the possibility to deliver high capacity at fast rates (1C), which is highly remarkable for an electrode mainly operating according to a conversion reaction mechanism.

Conclusions
The fabrication of rechargeable microbatteries represents the enabling technology for a large number of applications having high economic potential, such as high performance RF identification tags, sensors and smart cards.
The electrochemical fabrication of nanostructured electrodes seems to be one of the most promising tracks for improving the performances of small power sources. Indeed, the synthesis of self-assembled nanostructures provides materials presenting strong anisotropies and hence new properties over a large macroscopic surface. The dimensions of the nanostructures (pores, tubes, wires) can be usually tuned by adjusting the synthesis parameters. Moreover, fully electrochemical fabrication methods are highly desirable for reasons of simplicity and development costs allowing fast prototyping and rapid integration onto the production lines.
Currently, one of the main research paths is focussed on self-organized titania nanotubes that can be fabricated by a simple anodization treatment in fluoride-containing electrolytes. The resulting materials can be directly used as negative electrodes in Li-ion microbatteries. Electrodeposition is an efficient and reliable technique for preparing nanocrystallites,184nanowires and nanofibres. Novel nanostructured electrodes can be thus prepared by employing classical hard template techniques or by using alternative approaches leading to the formation of nanocomposites. The electrochemical performance of composite TiO2nt-oxide nanowires based electrodes is clearly enhanced by the 3D design of the negative electrode.
