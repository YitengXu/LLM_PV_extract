    , Accepted 19th March 2018First published on 19th March 2018AbstractA small molecule non-fullerene electron acceptor (SMNFEA), bearing a furan π-spacer and dicyano-n-hexyl rhodanine as flanking groups, was designed and synthesized for organic solar cell applications. Organic photovoltaic devices based on FRdCN2 and PTB7-Th polymer donors exhibited a highly improved efficient power conversion efficiency of 10.7%, which is the highest so far for OSCs fabricated from fluorene-core-based SMNFEAs.
Organic solar cells (OSCs) containing p-type conjugated polymers as donors and n-type fullerene derivatives as acceptors have been extensively investigated in the past few decades and power conversion efficiencies (PCE) over 10% have been achieved.1 However, fullerene derivatives suffer from several drawbacks, such as poor absorption in the visible region of the solar spectrum, difficulty in tuning frontier molecular orbital (FMO) energy levels, high synthetic cost and complications in the purification process.2 On the other hand, small molecule non-fullerene electron acceptors (SMNFEAs) have been widely employed in photovoltaic applications due to their merits: strong absorption in the visible and near IR regions, high molar extinction coefficient, good charge carrier mobility, appropriate FMO energy levels, easy purification and low production cost.3 Recently, a significant research effort has been made to improve the performance of SMNFEA-based bulk hetero junction (BHJ) OSCs, and PCEs up to 13% have been reported with different cores and a variety of end groups according to their different electron-withdrawing abilities.4 Introduction of various electron deficient end group units to π-conjugated molecules effectively enhances the light absorption properties and electron affinity of the resultant molecule, which consequently increases the photovoltaic performance of electron acceptors for BHJ OSCs. In the past few years, a variety of n-type conjugated SMNFEAs having strong electron deficient groups such as rhodanine, dicyano rhodanine, malononitrile, 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole, diketopyrrolopyrrole, 1,1-dicyanomethylene-3-indanone, perylene diimide and naphthalene monoimide were synthesized and used in OSCs.5 Use of fluorene, as a core moiety flanked with different electron deficient peripheral units, is one of the promising design templates for SMNFEAs. The solubility and aggregation behavior of fluorene-based molecules can be controlled by altering the side alkyl chain at the 9th position.6 The calamitic shaped SMNFEAs with a push–pull structure can be synthesized from a dialkylated fluorene core, attaching electron rich and electron poor groups. By proper molecular engineering, the optical band gap can be reduced, absorption properties can be enhanced, and the electron density of frontier molecular orbital (FMO) levels on a molecule can be controlled to facilitate charge transport properties. The electron donating and accepting groups are introduced as π-linkers to extend the conjugation and tune the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels. Thiophene and benzothiadiazole are two such commonly used π-linker groups.
SMNFEAs based on the fluorene core, which is directly attached to electron withdrawing units such as DPP, DPP–TCN and perylene-monoimide, were designed and synthesized. BHJ OSCs based on these acceptors achieved PCEs up to 2.37% using poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT) as an electron donor.7 Several fluorene-core-based SMNFEAs linked with electron accepting end units via a thiophene linker were also developed by Y. Kim and coworkers and such categories of molecules exhibited PCEs up to 3.08%, when blended with a P3HT donor.8 A highest PCE of 7.93% was achieved by DICTF while using PTB7-Th as a donor.9 Chen's group developed an acceptor named DTBTF using the fluorene core and thiobarbituric acid as electron deficient end groups and achieved a highest PCE of 3.84% with a DR3TSBDT small molecule donor.10 By replacing the thiophene linker with electron withdrawing benzothiadiazole, a variety of SMNFEAs were designed and synthesized to further improve the photovoltaic performance of OSCs. Holliday et al. reported fluorene-based non-fullerene acceptor FBR using benzothiadiazole-3-ethylrhodanine terminal dye units and a PCE of 4.11% was achieved.11 Wang et al developed a SMNFEA labeled as FBM based on a fluorene centre linked with benzothiadiazole malononitrile terminal unit acceptor groups achieving a PCE up to 5.1% with a PTB7-Th donor molecule.12 Singh's research group recently developed two fluorene-core-based SMNFEAs coded as BAF-2HDT and BAF-4CN having HDT and dicyano rhodanine terminal groups linked with benzothiadiazole and achieved PCEs of 7.1 and 8.4%, respectively.13 A summary of the recently published fluorene-core-based SMNFEAs is illustrated in Fig. 1 and Table S1 (ESI†) along with their respective PCEs in solar cells.

In this work, we developed a SMNFEA (FRdCN2) by molecular modification of previously reported acceptor BAF-4CNvia introducing furan as the π-spacer attached with electron deficient dicyano rhodanine groups as flanking groups (Fig. 2). The synthetic route of the molecule is depicted in Scheme S1 (ESI†). All intermediate and final molecules were characterized by FT-IR, NMR and MALDI-TOF spectrometry (Fig. S1–S8, ESI†). As compared to BAF-4CN, the new SMNFEA exhibits a stronger, broader and red shifted absorption in the visible region of the solar spectrum. Because of the electron deficient benzene unit, most of the fluorene-based SMNFEAs have low lying HOMO energy levels located around −5.6 eV. Two branched alkyl chains on the fluorene core improve the solubility of the resultant molecule, which in turn improves film morphology. Benzothiadiazole is an electron deficient unit incorporated not only to design the donor–acceptor copolymer for organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices, but also to develop SMNFEAs. It increases the electron deficient character of the molecules. Incorporation of the furan unit in π-conjugated molecules enhances the delocalization of the π-electron resulting in improved light absorption and reduced LUMO energy levels of small molecules. Using dicyano rhodanine as end units has particular interest since this substituent extends the light absorption of the final molecule by further extending π-conjugation. It also helps in increasing the electron affinity and electron mobility of the resultant π-conjugated molecule.

The normalized UV-visible absorption spectrum of the newly developed SMNFEA in chloroform (CHCl3) is shown in Fig. 3. The FRdCN2 molecule shows an excellent spectral response from 300–650 nm and a strong absorption peak at 522 nm with a molar extinction coefficient (ε) of 8.9 × 104 M−1 cm−1 (Fig. S9, ESI†). On the other hand, the thin film of FRdCN2 shows a red shifted absorption peak at 530 nm with a resolved shoulder peak at 561 nm because of more delocalized π-electrons in the solid state (Fig. 3).

Cyclic voltammetric (CV) measurements were carried out to investigate the electrochemical properties of the new SMNFEA. The HOMO energy level of the acceptor was estimated from the onset oxidation potential (Fig. S10, ESI†) and found to be −5.88 eV. The optical band gap (E0−0) of FRdCN2 is 2.07 eV as estimated from the absorption spectra in solution. The LUMO energy level calculated from the optical band gap (ELUMO = E0−0 + EHOMO) is found to be −3.81 eV. The optical and electrochemical parameters are summarized in Table S2 (ESI†) and the energy band diagram is presented in Fig. S11 (ESI†). The low lying LUMO energy level of FRdCN2 is expected to increase the open-circuit voltage (Voc) in the device. The introduction of the malononitrile group in the acceptor molecule to decrease the electron deficiency is an effective way to tune the FMO energy levels and reduce the band gap.
In order to envisage the distribution of HOMO and LUMO energy levels correlated with FRdCN2 molecules, ab initio structural optimization was carried out in the gas phase using time-dependent density functional theory in a Gaussian 09 program package using the B3LYP/6-311g(d,p) basis set. A 2-ethylhexyl chain on the fluorene core and the hexyl chain on dicyano rhodanine were modeled as ethyl and methyl groups, respectively, to simplify the calculation. Fig. 4 shows that the HOMO energy level is distributed on the entire molecule, whereas the LUMO is more concentrated on electron deficient groups in the arms. These are more sterically accessible to the donor molecules in the blend, which helps in charge transfer.

In order to check the photovoltaic performance of the new acceptor, BHJ OSCs were fabricated in inverted architecture-ITO/ZnO/photo active layer/MoO3/Ag (Fig. S11, ESI†). For the optimization of device performance, additive processing, solvent vapor annealing (SVA) and thermal annealing (TA) methods were adopted. 1-Chloronaphthalene (CN) and 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) were primarily selected as solvent additives to improve the solubility of the donor and acceptor molecules. The characteristic light current density–voltage (J–V) curves of BHJ devices fabricated under different experimental conditions are shown in Fig. S12a (ESI†). The solution processed BHJ OSCs constructed from as-cast PTB7-Th:FRdCN2 blend films without the use of any additive achieved a PCE of 7.2%. The PCE increased up to 7.6% after TA treatment of the photoactive layer. The CN additive appeared to be more compatible with the FRdCN2 acceptor than DIO. The OPV devices constructed from thermally annealed PTB7-Th:FRdCN2 blends showed PCEs of 7.8 and 8.9% when DIO and CN were used as additives, respectively. The PCE significantly improved from 8.9 to 10.7% upon SVA treatment with an enhanced Jsc of 16.0 mA cm−2, FF of 71.9% and Voc of 0.934 V. The J–V curve of the best performing device for the acceptor is shown in Fig. 5a. As per our knowledge, 10.7% PCE is the highest reported efficiency so far for fluorene-core-based fullerene-free OSCs. The photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table S3 (ESI†). To check the reproducibility, at least thirty devices were made for each category from several independent runs. The average PCEs of the respective category of OPV devices are mentioned in the parentheses of Table S3 (ESI†). Fig. S13 (ESI†) shows the statistical distribution of fifty such cells made from TA and SVA-treated photo-active layers. The high reproducibility of device results is an indication of a stable device fabrication process and the reliability of component molecules. From an experiment on device aging stability, it is observed that the PCE of PTB7-Th:FRdCN2 has decreased by only 9% over a period of 40 days; whereas for PTB7-Th:PC70BM-based reference solar cells, a 26% fall in PCE has been noticed for the same duration of time (Fig. S14, ESI†). Hence, it can be inferred that FRdCN2-based devices are more durable than the standard PC70BM-based devices.

Spectral response measurements were carried out on OPV devices fabricated from the new SMNFEA with the respective additive and annealing treatments in order to investigate photon-to-electron conversion processes in those devices. As shown in Fig. 5b and Fig. S12b (ESI†), the spectral response curves of PTB7-Th:FRdCN2-based devices exhibited a very high external quantum efficiency (EQE) value and strong photo response from 400 to 710 nm. The OPV device fabricated from PTB7-Th:FRdCN2 using CN as an additive and TA treatment exhibited a maximum EQE of 74% at 530 nm and an EQE value of up to 80% was achieved upon SVA treatment of the active layer. The higher EQE values of PTB7-Th:FRdCN2-based OPV devices indicated the efficient photon-to-current conversion efficiency of PTB7-Th:FRdCN2.
To estimate the charge carrier mobility of the donors and acceptors, single carrier devices were made from the blend films with a proper choice of electrodes – ITO/PEDOT:PSS/blend/Au as a ‘hole only’ device and ITO/ZnO/blend/Al as an ‘electron only’ device. The mobility values are calculated by Mott–Gurney's space charge limited current model14 (Fig. S15 and Table S4, ESI†). The electron mobility value of μe for FRdCN2 is found to be 3.2 × 10−4 and 5.1 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the films treated with TA and SVA, respectively. The donor polymer's hole mobility (μh) in the blend is also found to be increased with SVA treatment. It is noteworthy to mention that upon SVA treatment, hole and electron mobility become more well-balanced. The ratio of μe/μh is reduced from 1.77 (TA) to 1.50 upon SVA treatment for PTB7-Th:FRdCN2 blend films. A well-balanced hole and electron mobility is known to improve the fill factor of the OSCs, which is reflected in the photovoltaic results of our solar cells (Table S2, ESI†).
From the photoluminescence (PL) quenching spectra in Fig. S16a (ESI†), it is observed that the PL intensity of PTB7-Th is quenched by 88.6% for PTB7-Th:FRdCN2, when the D/A weight ratio is 1:2.5. The value of the Stern–Volmer quenching coefficient (Ksv)15 for PTB7-Th:FRdCN2 blend films is calculated from the gradient of the linear fit of Stern–Volmer plots (Fig. S16b, ESI†) and found to be 8.85 × 104 M−1. The high value of Ksv indicates that the new molecule can accept electrons from the PTB7-Th donor efficiently.
In order to study the evolution of the microstructural properties in PTB7-Th-based blend films, 2D grazing-incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) measurements were carried out. Fig. S17 (ESI†) shows the GIXRD patterns of pristine PTB7-Th and FRdCN2 along with their blends prepared under different experimental conditions. However, no characteristic peak was found in the diffractogram of pristine PTB7-Th and the thermally annealed blend film. The diffraction pattern of the SVA-treated PTB7-Th:FRdCN2 film shows a weak peak at q ∼ 1.7 Å−1 owing to π–π stacking in the (010) direction. A rise of peak near q ∼ 0.14 Å−1 due to lamellar stacking (h00) is also noticeable in the SVA films. The strong lamellar (h00) and π–π (010) stacking peaks are known to improve the charge carrier mobility, which in turn leads to better PCE in the case of OSCs.16
To investigate the nanoscale morphology of blend photoactive layers, topological images of films in the lateral direction were captured by atomic force microscopy (AFM) in tapping mode (Fig. 6). The ‘thermally annealed’ PTB7-Th:FRdCN2 blend films show a root mean square (RMS) roughness of 3.1 nm. However, the film morphology becomes significantly smoother upon SVA treatment. The RMS roughness of the film surface is measured to be 1.9 nm for the PTB7-Th:FRdCN2 blend. A smooth surface in the case of PTB7-Th:FRdCN2 devices improves the metal–semiconductor interface and helps to improve charge transport and collection.

In summary, a fullerene-free electron acceptor, coded FRdCN2, was designed, synthesized and thoroughly characterized. Its photovoltaic performance was investigated in inverted structured OSCs. Introduction of a furan unit increases the delocalization of π-electrons by extending the conjugation of molecules, reduces the energy band gap and broadens the optical absorption spectra. A high value of the Stern–Volmer coefficient confirms that a new SMNFEA can accept electrons efficiently from the donor. SVA treatment is found to result in a smooth film surface and improved crystallinity. The BHJ devices based on PTB7-Th:FRdCN2 blends demonstrated an excellent PCE of 10.7% upon SVA treatment. The FRdCN2-based devices are found to be more stable and durable than conventional PC70BM-based OSCs. Hence it can be inferred that fluorene-core-based SMNFEAs have the potential to successfully replace costly and unstable fullerenes for the fabrication of high performance OPV devices.
