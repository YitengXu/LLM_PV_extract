    , Accepted 1st February 2021First published on 3rd February 2021AbstractThe current demand for sustainable processes is increasing day by day. The considerable growth in biotechnological industries is attributed to enhanced enzyme production and their stability, and development in technologies for process intensification, which can pave the way towards large scale production and economical formulation. White biotechnology deals with the implementation of biotechnology at the industrial level. It is considered as one of the key tools, which can be utilized to boost the bio-economy. With the increasing research in the field of biocatalysis, it is proved to be a green tool in the synthesis of fine chemicals. It is quite evident that biocatalysis has numerous advantages over chemical catalysis. Immobilization of enzymes is the key towards practical and commercial viability of the processes, which improves the activity, stability, and reusability of enzymes, thereby making the biocatalytic reactions more sustainable and economical. The amalgamation of biocatalysis with process intensification techniques such as microwaves, ultrasound, hydrodynamic cavitation, and the combination of chemical and biological catalysis can be an effective way to enhance the yield and productivity of these processes. The use of microreactor technologies and continuous modes of operation, the co-called flow chemistry, has been exploited for different biocatalytic reactions. The current review summarizes and discusses the applications of immobilized enzymes used in different process intensification techniques. The techniques utilized can help in achieving better productivity and enhanced yields as compared to those with conventional techniques.

1. Introduction
White biotechnology is one such field that focuses on the production and processing of chemicals, various kinds of materials, and energy with the help of living organisms such as microbes, yeasts, fungi, and enzymes for the industrial-scale production of fine, bulk, specialty chemicals, and value-added products. The value-added products include fine chemicals, enantiomerically pure building blocks, secondary metabolites in pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals, bioactive compounds, food, flavor, perfumery, and medical products.1 The main aim of developing white biotechnology is to reduce the environmental impact and development of sustainable processes. With the use of industrial biotechnology, there can be an estimated reduction of 50% in carbon dioxide emissions, 20% in energy consumption, and 75% in water consumption. Along with these, it can also reduce the capital and operating costs up to 50%.2 The first industrial large scale application of modern biotechnology was applied in animal feed and food production (agricultural/green biotechnology) and pharmaceuticals (medicinal/red biotechnology).3 Biocatalysis is the subspecialty of white biotechnology used for the production of a large variety of chemical products.
Enzymes are remarkable biocatalysts capable of accepting a wide range of complex molecules as substrates. They can be used in simple and complex biotransformations. Biocatalytic processes are different from conventional chemical processes owing to their operational stability under technical conditions, enzyme kinetics, and catalyst features.4,5 The biocatalytic processes are broadly classified according to the form of the biocatalyst used for the biotransformation: whole-cell biocatalysis derived using fermentation, isolated-enzyme biocatalysis, and immobilized enzyme biocatalysis.6 The utilization of enzymes as biocatalysts in industries has increased tremendously, stimulating attention for enhanced enzyme stability and functionality.7 Biocatalysis is a promising area for the development of sustainable technology for the production of several chemicals applied in various industries. High stereo- and enantioselectivity is a particularly important feature of biocatalysis.1 Although biocatalysis has tremendous scope in industries, its applications have limitations such as limited enzyme availability and enzyme stability. The recent scientific breakthrough in enzyme directed evolution, exploitation of biodiversity, and novel supports for enzyme immobilization can help in overcoming these issues. As a result, we can expect the new industrial applications of biocatalysis from single-step to multistep enzymatic conversions to reach more efficient and sustainable processes. The scope of biocatalysis is widened with its applications due to advances in metabolic and protein engineering with the development of new microbial strains, which can help in the synthesis of complex molecules and enzyme immobilization, which provides good operational stability, wide substrate scope, and selectivity.8,9
2. Process intensification
Process intensification (PI) seeks safer and sustainable technological developments. Its aims include the reduction of the number of equipment, enhancement in heat and mass transfer by innovative mixing technologies and shorter diffusion paths, miniaturization, novel energy techniques, novel separation methods, reduction in process time (due to higher reaction rates by using better catalysts or reactor configurations), integrated optimization, and control strategies. So, the use of microwave irradiation is a PI strategy, particularly because there is enhancement in heat and mass transfer coefficients leading to lower energy consumption and improved reaction rates leading to reduction in reactor volume.10,11
The application of industrial biocatalytic processes can be established with the use of single or multiple enzymes, as well as whole cells as catalysts in the synthesis of various chemicals. The major challenges for the implementation of biocatalytic processes include the availability of the large quantity of enzymes at an industry-relevant scale, choice of suitable biocatalysts such as whole-cells, immobilized enzymes, or free enzymes based on the application, catalyst screening time, and integration of optimal process parameters to achieve maximum yield.12 Furthermore, the cost occurring in downstream processing and protein engineering of enzymes for better operational stability add limitations in the development of biocatalytic processes. The development and implementation of new bioprocesses with the use of biocatalysis are highly dependent on process intensification.13 Although much progress has been made in the development and implementation of new bioprocesses in industry for years, these suffer from an industrial perspective offering lower yields. Here, process intensification plays a very significant role.
As stated before process intensification aims towards a reduction in energy consumption and the overall processing cost by enhancing the heat, mass, and momentum transfer rate.14 Stankiewicz and Moulijn15 defined process intensification as the drastic advancement in processing and manufacturing, significantly decreasing the volume of equipment and total energy consumption, leading to safer, cheaper, and sustainable technologies. Process intensification aims towards the following outcomes: i. smaller equipment size; ii. higher throughput; iii. lower inventory usage; and iv. higher performance or material stroke and energy efficiency. It can also increase the throughput of the process by changes in internals in the reactor or separator.
Van Gerven and Stankiewicz16 defined process intensification in four principles: structure domain, energy domain, functional, and time domain. These principles can be either implemented individually or can be combined and applied to obtain a high degree of process intensification. Process intensification can be classified into process intensifying equipment and methods. The types of equipment include chemical processes and physical processes. Classic examples of chemical processes are microreactors and static mixing catalysts, whereas those for physical processes are static mixers and microchannel heat exchangers. The process intensifying methods include multifunctional reactors (reactive distillation, extraction, crystallization, fuel cells, and chromatographic reactors), hybrid separations (distillation, adsorptive distillation, and membrane adsorption), alternative energy sources (solar energy, microwave, ultrasound, plasma technology, and electric fields) and other methods (supercritical fluids).17,18
Process intensification has the advantage of increasing the productivity and overall rate of the process. The adoption of a new design of equipment and biocatalysts for enhancing the intrinsic rate of reaction will help in achieving higher productivity. Therefore, the synergism between process intensification and catalysis is imperative in the current biochemical process scenario. Hence, this review highlights the synergistic application of some of the most recent innovative happenings in the field of enzymatic catalysis with particular focus on the application of immobilized enzymes in microwave-assisted, ultrasound-assisted, and continuous flow reactions towards the development of sustainable processes for the production of industrially relevant bioactive molecules. Each of the approaches for process intensification is briefly described in the following sections. The review compiles the state of the art involving only immobilized enzymes applied for process intensification with a focus on the last 10 years of literature.
3. Methods of immobilization and supports
The immobilization of enzymes on various supports is a major challenge in biocatalysis. Immobilization facilitates enzyme use and easy product separation ultimately improving process economy. The main aim of immobilization of enzymes is to enhance stability, reusability, and resistance to different environmental factors.19 The method of immobilization depends on the application of the immobilized enzyme in a particular reactor and can be tuned according to the desired application. Biocatalysts need to be fine-tuned according to synthetic requirements and engineered to facilitate prolonged efficiency under mild reaction conditions of temperature and pressure.
The first immobilization of an enzyme was reported way back in 1916, wherein invertase was physically adsorbed on charcoal, and the authors observed that the immobilized enzyme retained its catalytic activity perfectly. Thereafter, immobilization of enzymes has become a critical topic for researchers.20 The most common immobilization techniques include physical adsorption, covalent attachment, crosslinking, encapsulation, and entrapment. The physical methods constitute of entrapment and adsorption, whereas the chemical methods include cross-linking and covalent attachment. Entrapment includes microencapsulation, gel or fiber entrapping, and MOF (metal–organic framework) embedding, and crosslinking includes linking to the support matrix or CLEAs (cross-linking enzyme aggregates).21Fig. 1 illustrates the various modes of immobilization of enzymes.
 Fig. 1  Different methods of immobilization. 
A wide variety of materials of different origins can be used as supports for the immobilization of enzymes. These materials are divided into inorganic, organic, and hybrid supports. The classic materials used for immobilization are mentioned in Fig. 2. The primary role of the support is to harbor the enzyme structure from harsh reaction conditions and retain high catalytic activity. A variety of possible carriers with different sizes, shapes, and forms can be developed according to the application for various immobilization protocols.
 Fig. 2  Classic materials used for immobilization of enzymes. 
The inorganic materials generally include silica and inorganic oxides, carbon-based, and mineral materials. Silica has been the classic and most abundantly used material for immobilization. Its high surface area, good mechanical properties, high thermal stability, and chemical resistance make it an ideal material for many industrial applications. Also, the presence of surface hydroxyl groups on silica makes it easy for the functionalization of different modifying agents such as glutaraldehyde or 3-aminopropyltriethoxy silane (APTES). Fig. 3 shows a typical example of APTES functionalization on a silica support and glutaraldehyde cross-linking for enzyme immobilization. Various enzymes such as hydrolases, oxidoreductases, and transferases have been immobilized on fumed silica, sol–gel silica, silica nanoparticles, and mesoporous silica supports such as MCM-41, SBA-15,22,23 MCF,24,25 HMS,26 FDU-15, etc.27,28 Inorganic oxides such as titanium, zirconium, and aluminum have also been used for immobilization. Other examples include magnetic particles,29 carbon supports such as charcoal, carbon nanotubes,30 graphene,25 and graphene oxide,31 zeolites, nanoparticles, and ceramic supports.32,33
 Fig. 3  Typical example of APTES functionalization and glutaraldehyde cross-linking for immobilization of enzymes. 
The organic materials are further divided into polymers (synthetic materials) and biopolymers, which are renewable materials from natural sources. Some examples of polymer supports include polyamide nylon 66, polystyrene microspheres, polyurethane foam, polyvinyl alcohol,34,35 and polymeric membranes.36 Biopolymers have unique characteristics such as biodegradability, biocompatibility, non-toxicity, and easy availability, which make them ideal as supports for enzyme immobilization. Their natural origin helps in retaining high catalytic activity. Examples of biopolymers include agarose,37 gelatin, collagen, cellulose,38 keratin, carrageenan,39 sepharose,40 chitin, chitosan,41 and alginate.42–44 Other examples of organic materials include electrospun materials and polymeric membranes.33,42
The hybrid composite materials are a combination of different materials. The combined materials usually exhibit improved stability, mechanical strength, and improved reusability of the matrix, which makes the biocatalytic system stronger.45 Hybrid materials include organic–organic, organic–inorganic, and inorganic–inorganic hybrids. A few examples include zinc oxide, titanium oxide,46 macroporous SiO2/ZnO nanowires,47 silica magnetic nanoparticles,48 chitosan/CeO2 microspheres,49 synthetic polymers like poly (p-phenylenediamine) or poly(4-vinyl pyridine),50 and graphene oxide nanocomposites.51,52
4. Microwave-assisted reactions
4.1 Introduction
Microwave irradiation technology has evolved as a green and clean source of energy. The synergism of microwave irradiation has been shown to enhance the rate of reaction in different types of enzymatic reactions. Microwave-assisted reactions show an enhanced rate as compared with conventional heating, as the heat transfer in the reaction medium is through radiation instead of conduction and convection. The heat loss is much lower compared to conventional heating.53 Microwave heating uses the ability of the reaction medium to transform electromagnetic radiation into heat. The energy transmission is due to dielectric heating in contrast to that with conduction and convection, which is the principle behind conventional heating.54 The high excitation energy provided by microwave irradiation is sufficient enough to overcome the barrier completing the reaction rapidly as compared to conventional heating. Due to the easy energy absorption of the reactants present in the reaction medium, their functional groups are highly reactive with the surrounding reactants. Microwave irradiation depends mainly on the polarity and dielectric properties of the reaction medium.55,56
Microwave irradiation has tremendous potential and been established as a sustainable alternative to conventional heating. Low-temperature microwave reactions can reduce or eliminate the formation of side products due to various thermal effects and can be applied widely due to their fast rate and safety. The low temperature in microwave reactions can be controlled by adjusting the microwave irradiation source, the use of a cooling medium, controlling the initial temperature of the reaction, changing the physical properties of reactions, and the use of an appropriate solvent. The advantages of microwave heating over conventional heating include rapid heat transfer, selective and uniform heating, fast on and off switching, compact reactors, a clean environment, and no destructive effects on the enzyme.57,58
Enzymatic microwave-assisted reactions are rapid, clean, and offer better yields in a short span of reaction time as compared to that of the conventional heating mechanism. Their advantages include reduced reaction time, easy work-up, energy efficiency, improved enzyme stability, and less solvent consumption.59 Furthermore, solvent-free reactions and the use of ionic liquids in combination with microwave irradiation can offer efficient and safe technology.
4.2 Microwave irradiation principle
Microwaves are electromagnetic waves with frequencies of 0.3 to 300 GHz.60 The mechanism behind microwaves concerns ionic conduction and dipolar polarization. In dipole polarization, the polar molecules try to align themselves due to the constant change of electric fields versus the intermolecular force. Because polar molecules are not in the same phase as that with the applied field, it results in collisions, and the absorbed energy is lost into heat. So, an adequate frequency of radiation is required to maintain sufficient oscillation between the molecules. Microwave radiation with a frequency of 2.45 GHz is sufficient enough to align polar molecules with an applied field.
In the case of ionic conduction, the interactions occur between electric components and ions in the sample medium. The oscillation of ions in the medium is generated due to the oscillating electromagnetic field. Hence the ions collide with each other creating friction and lose their energy converting it into heat. This heating ability of ionic species can be used for heating of non-polar solvents under microwave irradiation. The energy loss is much higher in ionic conduction than that in dipole polarization.61,62
4.3 Conventional heating vs. microwave heating
Conventional heating is carried out with an external heating source such as an oil bath and heating mantles to carry out various kinds of reactions. Heat transfer takes place through a conductive mechanism in series initially through the wall of the vessel to the reaction medium containing reactants and solvents. So, the heat transfer depends on the thermal conductivity of the material of construction. During the reaction, there is a considerable temperature drop between the outer surface of the reaction vessel and the reaction medium, which results in a delay in reaching the desired reaction temperature. This ultimately hampers the reaction and may result in the formation of by-products. The heating mechanism of conventional and microwave heating is mentioned in Fig. 4.
 Fig. 4  Heating mechanism in (a) conventional and (b) microwave heating (reproduced with permission from the source: http://lab-plusinternational.com/). 
Contrarily, in microwave irradiation, the direct coupling of microwave energy with the reaction medium increases the reaction temperature due to coherent internal heating. The common materials employed for the reaction vessels of microwave reactors include transparent materials such as quartz, borosilicate glass, and Teflon. As the rate of energy transmission depends on the dielectric loss of reaction components, it is completely independent of the conductivity of the material of construction of the reaction vessel. So, the reaction vessel and the reaction components get heated simultaneously. As microwave heating is rapid, many reactions that are slow in nature can be performed under microwave heating to enhance the rate of reaction, yield, and selectivity.63
4.4 Scale up of microwave assisted reactions
Since its introduction in 1986,64 and particularly during the last two decades, microwave-assisted chemistry has become ubiquitous in synthetic organic chemistry labs with the concomitant development of microwave equipment and peripheral devices for monitoring online the progress of such reactions. Several articles, monographs and special issues have been written, the latest being January 2019 Special Issue of The Chemical Record on Flow/Microwave Chemistry.65 As an alternative to conductive heating, microwave heating has certain benefits such as improved reaction kinetics due to the rapid increase in temperature and better mass transfer and heat transfer rates coupled with selective heating without any heating media.66 These special effects can be attributed to the intrinsic physical characteristics of the microwaves and are thus called the microwave effect. Although microwave techniques are rapid, clean, and energy-saving, certain aspects of MOAS like the non-uniform microwave spots in the microwave cavity and low permeability activity of microwaves need to be improved. The greatest challenge surrounding microwave chemistry or microwave-assisted organic synthesis (MAOS) was if the technology would be scaled up to commercial manufacture to improve productivity, quality, and finally lower costs.67–71 Its importance in the pharmaceutical and fine/specialty chemical industries cannot be overlooked.
There are numerous large laboratory microwave systems available, which use different methods to achieve the kilogram scale, including parallel reactors, stopped-flow and continuous-flow, etc. The industrial scale-up of microwave heating has been achieved in many other industries, including food, ceramics and mineral processing, but was not demonstrated in organic synthesis for quite some time since the first publication in 1986. There were several reasons for this shortcoming, not least that scaling up specialty and pharmaceutical reactions requires very versatile equipment and systems capable of converting lab data to the plant. Particularly because microwave irradiation has a limited penetration depth characterized by the material's dielectric properties, for most pharmaceutical reactions of interest, it varies between 1 cm and 10 cm. Retrofitting microwave heating to a large, stirred reactor is not an alternative since only the outside layer would be heated as with conventional jacketed reactors due to limited penetration of microwaves.72 Therefore, a tubular reactor with an adequate (smaller) diameter with continuous processing is needed to scale up MAOS; alternatively, a series of continuous flow stirred reactors (CSTRs) leading to a plug flow pattern of mixing can be used. These flow systems are applicable to homogeneous liquid (L), liquid–solid (L–S catalysts), gas–liquid (G–L), and G–L–S reactions at elevated temperatures and pressures, including those reactions above the boiling points of solvents, in an individually sealed channel. As a result, the microwave-assisted continuous flow chemistry can reduce the reaction time, improve rates and throughput, reduce waste, and produce high-grade products with fewer byproducts (if any). The microwave irradiated flow chemical synthesis can reduce the problems of non-uniform heating and penetration depth and maximize the benefits of rapid heating and fast temperature changes having applications in organic syntheses, enzymatic reactions, and nanoparticle syntheses.73,74
An industrial scale reactor can manufacture around 25 kg per day. Reactor assembly with larger volume for tonnage production, and also a 2 cm inner diameter pilot reactor, capable of production up to 200 kg per day and handling higher weight solid–liquid (catalytic) slurries, is claimed. The technology is not product or process specific and is a universal methodology, allowing pharmaceutical manufacturing to catch up with other large chemical industries, well versed in the benefits of continuous-flow and microwave-heating.72 The scale-up of fundamental organic reactions using a novel flow microwave system developed by the academic-industrial alliance between the University of Shizuoka, Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, and SAIDA FDS has been reported.75 More advancement has taken place in scale up including the use of tunable, solid-state oscillator, single-mode microwave continuous flow reactors, which provide more versatile heating and impart better process control and energy efficiency toward laboratory and larger-scale synthetic chemistry applications.76 By applying advanced telecommunication solid state devices to the microwave (MW) resonant cavity system for flow chemistry, it becomes possible to heat up low polarity solvents higher than 250 °C, which are considered impossible to heat up by MW until now. The resonant cavity system has opened new vistas to production processes of specialty chemicals which require low-cost plants, high yield, and high productivity capacity.77
The Oliver Kappe group discussed the application of microwave irradiation for various organic chemical transformations78,79 and drug discovery.80 They have discussed in detail the issues in the scale-up of microwave-assisted reactions. They clearly state the need for larger-scale techniques for the synthesis of products on a multikilogram scale. The physical limitation for scale-up in the design of the reactor is microwave dielectric heating. Higher throughput in mono mode cavities, specialized vessel design, and more reliable parallel reactors with improved temperature control need to be addressed. Another major issue in the application of microwave reactors is the cost associated with the instrument. Although the price range of microwave reactors is reduced since their first introduction in the late 1990s, it is still higher than conventional heating equipment.81
4.5 Applications of different industrially relevant microwave reactions
Much literature is available on the enzymatic microwave-assisted synthesis of a variety of products. Novozym 435, immobilized CAL B (Candida antarctica lipase B immobilized on polyacrylamide resin) supplied by Novozymes, is the most common enzyme widely used both in industry and academia due to its commercial availability.82 A whole lot of literature is available on the synthesis of various industrially important reactions such as esterification, transesterification, acylation, alcoholysis, and solvent-free synthesis under microwave irradiation using Novozym 435 as the most promising catalyst.83–85 A few examples of lipase-catalyzed microwave-assisted reactions are mentioned in Table 1 which summarizes the commonly used lipases and their names.

Risso et al.86 demonstrated the microwave-assisted solvent-free synthesis of β-ketoesters using Novozym 435. The use of solvent-free synthesis has an advantage of diminishing waste formation. They achieved high yields of up to 96% in the competitive time of <2 h. Microwave irradiation worked excellently under solvent-free conditions making the process environment-friendly. Further, to ensure the economic viability of the process, an enzyme reusability study was conducted in both conventional and microwave heating. Microwave irradiation did affect the stability of the enzyme; however, it was found to be stable after 10 consecutive cycles without loss in the activity and was better than thermal heating. In another study, the production of ascorbyl palmitate was performed using Novozym 435. The results indicated that microwave irradiation provided efficient and controlled heating with a yield of 71% under the optimized conditions of 15 molar ratio and 15% w/w enzyme in a reaction time of 1 h. The parameters of temperature, enzyme loading, and molar ratio were estimated using central composite design. The reaction was conducted with different organic solvents such as amyl alcohol, acetonitrile, cyclohexane, and acetone. tert-Amyl alcohol was found to be the best solvent among all tested. The solvent used in microwave-assisted reactions can have a significant influence on the heating profile affecting the rate of reaction.87
Réjasse et al. studied the influence of microwave heating on the stability of the enzyme and concluded that the enzyme was more stable under MW than under conventional heating. They studied the stability of Novozym 435 in organic medium at 100 °C for the alcoholysis reaction between ethyl butyrate and butanol (Scheme 1). The study demonstrated that enzyme stability was better in the polar solvent as the applied microwave field strongly interacts with polar solvents.88 The interaction between the enzyme moiety and the applied microwave field might be inducing the modification in the enzyme configuration. It was observed that the heating mode had an influence on the kinetics of free enzyme inactivation. The Arrhenius plot under conventional heating was linear, whereas that under microwave heating showed 2 inactivation regimes for the free enzyme.

This was due to the inactivation of the enzyme at higher temperatures and modification in enzyme configuration. Yadav and Borkar89 carried out the enzyme-catalyzed synthesis of citronellyl acetate with 93% conversion (Scheme 2). The reaction was also conducted under microwave heating without the enzyme, which did not initiate the reaction. Hence, they concluded the synergism between microwave irradiation and enzyme catalysis. The lipase activity increased with microwave irradiation due to increased collision of reactant molecules and a decrease in the inhibition coefficient. Microwave irradiation increases the substrate affinity towards the active site of the enzyme due to the synergism between the reaction medium and microwaves on the enzyme. The activation energy under conventional heating was 8.28 kcal mol−1, whereas that under microwave irradiation was 8.57 kcal mol−1. In addition, the frequency factor m3 mol−1 s−1 was found to be 1.7 × 10−3 and 0.319 under conventional and microwave heating, respectively. The frequency factor was increased by 190-fold under microwave irradiation. This enhancement was attributed to the increased collision of molecules and entropy of the reaction system.

Much literature is available on the enzymatic synthesis of biodiesel under MW. Rós et al.90 demonstrated the synthesis of biodiesel from palm oil using Pseudomonas fluorescens under microwave irradiation. The enzyme was immobilized on an epoxy polysiloxane–PVA hybrid composite. The results showed 97.56% conversion of fatty acid ethyl esters in 12 h. Similarly, fatty acid methyl esters from soybean oil and methanol were produced using Novozym 435 with a 94% yield in 12 h (Scheme 3). The immobilized enzyme was stable for five cycles with no apparent loss of lipase activity, suggesting the high stability of the enzyme under microwave irradiation.91 Chuck et al.92 showed that microwave irradiation did not alter the fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) or biodiesel profile, and over 99% of lipid was esterified in 20 min. They also concluded that microwave irradiation accounted for less than 20% of the energy content required for biodiesel production. More recently, microwave heating was combined with a continuous flow reactor. Likewise, Barnard et al.93 demonstrated continuous flow transesterification of vegetable oil for biodiesel synthesis under microwave heating. The reaction was carried out at a flow rate of 7.2 L min−1 using a 4 L reaction vessel under atmospheric conditions. The study suggested that combined continuous-flow microwave methodology was much energy-efficient than conventional heating.

Although Novozym 435 is the most favored biocatalyst utilized for multiple reactions, it has some stability issues which also need to be addressed. Some of the major problems include retention of hydrophilic compounds surrounding the enzyme matrix, the solubility of the support in organic media, leaching of the enzyme, and fragility of the support towards mechanical agitation. The retention of hydrophilic compounds in the surrounding enzyme matrix is much of an issue as it might lead to denaturation of the enzyme due to conditions such as low pH or enzyme inactivation due to direct exposure of acids or alcohols in the surrounding matrix. Since the matrix of the biocatalyst is hydrophilic in nature, it tends to accumulate the acid or water formed during the reaction leading to the inactivation of the enzyme. The second major issue is the stability of the support in organic media such as alcohol. A few examples are reported in the literature wherein the PMMA support was soluble in a solvent such as ethanol. They revealed that the mass of the polymer support decreased, and the components of the support, such as polymethacrylate and Lewatit, were detected in the dissolved medium. This similar effect was also observed in other alcohols such as methanol and 1-propanol. The next and the most common issue with the application of Novozym 435 (N435), which is also observed in other supports, is enzyme leaching from the support. Enzyme leaching is due to several reasons such as high temperature weakening the interaction between the matrix and enzyme, the effect of organic co-solvents weakening the enzyme–support, and hydrophobic interactions releasing the enzyme. Enzyme leaching was also reported in ionic liquids and solvent-free reactions in the case of N435. Lastly, the fragility of the biocatalyst becomes an issue if agitated under higher speed. The biocatalyst may be found to be stable when reactions are carried out under the lab scale, but the fragility may be a bigger problem when the reaction is carried out at an industrial scale wherein depending on type of impeller and nature of support, greater attrition could be encounteered at higher speeds required to remove the mass transfer limitation. At a higher speed, the catalyst beads would be broken.94–96
The Oliver Kappe group highlighted the use of a fiber-optic probe for monitoring of internal reaction temperature. In order to compare the effect of the microwave reactor to that of the conventional reactor, all the conditions (reaction parameters), reaction volumes, and vessels should be exactly the same for both experiments. Usually, temperature monitoring is done using the externally calibrated IR sensing technology. The fiber optic probe gives an exact idea about the temperature inside the reaction vessel, which is a more reliable, accurate, and fast responding technology. This way, the exact comparison between the microwave reactor and conventional reactor can be made.97,98
The comparison between conventional and microwave heating of various industrially relevant microwave reactions is listed in Table 2. In fact, in the published literature on microwave reactors, the scale-up criteria are not given. The quality of mixing is governed by the effective energy input by the unit mass or unit volume of fluid. Mixing processes and the type of mixing affect the chemical reaction rates, yield and selectivity. The depth of penetration of the microwaves would certainly affect the performance. For instance, the mixing characteristics for the same reaction can be simulated by taking the same tip speed for the laboratory reactor and the industrial reactor. The tip speed is equivalent to the product of the impeller diameter and speed (length/time) for the same type of impeller for agitated vessels with four equi-spaced baffles and the power input per unit volume being the same. The mixing is governed by the impeller design (blade number, blade angle, blade and disk dimensions, and blade shape), the location of the impeller (off-bottom clearance, distance from the vessel centre or eccentricity), and the vessel size. The mixing performance also depends on the internals such as baffles (number, dimension, and position).99,100 This should be considered while doing scale-up for microwave reactors.

Yadav and Lathi121 showed the synergism of microwaves and the immobilized enzyme on adipic acid ester synthesis (Scheme 4). The rapid collisions of the reactant molecules increase the rate of microwave-assisted reactions without affecting the value of activation energy. In each cycle of electromagnetic energy, microwaves are transferred within 10−9 s and the kinetic molecular relaxation time is 10−5 s. So, the energy transfer is faster than the relaxation time of molecules leading to non-equilibrium conditions. This ultimately increases the temperature of the system instantaneously affecting the kinetics of the reaction. Moreover, the activation energy or the orientation of collisions is not affected by microwave irradiation. They reported a 2.63-fold enhancement in conversion as compared with conventional heating. The other reason for the increase in initial rates under microwave irradiation can be due to conformational modifications of enzymes leading to easy accessibility of the substrate towards the active site of the enzyme.122 The enzyme particle is surrounded by a thin aqueous layer, which is also known as the essential water layer. So, the pores of the matrix are filled with this layer, and hence the enzyme does not denature directly. In the case of a non-aqueous reaction medium with microwave irradiation, the microwaves have a direct effect on the rate of reaction as the number of collisions of the reactant molecules is higher without affecting the activation energy of the reaction.123 However, when the temperature of the reaction is increased, the essential water sublimates, leading to the inactivation of the enzyme. According to the studies by Réjasse et al.84 and Yadav and Borkar,89 the enzyme stability was higher with microwave heating than conventional thermal heating. The interaction between the polar solvent and the microwave field gives high enzymatic stability producing better results under microwave irradiation.
 Scheme 4  Synthesis of adipic acid esters using Novozym 435 under MW. 
The application of MW was further extended to the chemo-enzymatic epoxidation of styrene to styrene oxide using lipase by Yadav and Borkar112 Novozym 435 catalyzes the reaction between hydrogen peroxide and lauric acid-generating perlauric acid. This perlauric acid is utilized for the epoxidation of styrene to styrene oxide (Scheme 5). They observed an increase in frequency factor with microwave irradiation, which was due to the enhanced collision of molecules due to the increased entropy. In addition, the effect of H2O2 and lauric acid on the enzyme was also studied. The reaction follows a ternary dead-end complex mechanism with inhibition due to hydrogen peroxide. Furthermore, the deactivation of lipase under microwave irradiation was substantially reduced. The highest conversion of 70% was achieved at 50 °C with 1 M 50% w/v H2O2, 1 M styrene oxide and 0.33 M lauric acid at a microwave power of 50 W.112 In another work by Saifuddin et al.124 chemo-enzymatic epoxidation of palm acid oil using lipase was carried out. The experiments were conducted using a 3-D Finite Element Model for the temperature predictions for the enzymatic epoxidation of palm acid oil using microwave irradiation. The energy required in microwave heating is far less than that required for conventional heating, and the application of microwave heating significantly improved the epoxidation process. The study revealed that epoxidation could be rapidly done with enzymes at a lower level of activation energy. Yu et al.125 conducted a chemo-enzymatic reaction for sequential kinetic resolution of (R,S)-2-octanol under MW, which included a combination of chemical racemization and enzymatic resolution (Scheme 6). Lipase from Pseudomonas sp. (PSL) was immobilized on SBA-15, mesoporous molecular sieves, strong basic styrene anion exchange resin, and alumina with chromium trioxide as an oxidant and sodium borohydride as a reductant. Under the optimum conditions, 85% yield with 99% enantiomeric excess in 2 h was achieved, and the E value increased up to 40 under microwave irradiation, and that in conventional heating was 23. The chemo-enzymatic approach further widens the scope of microwave-assisted enzymatic reactions.

 Scheme 6  Chemo-enzymatic sequential kinetic resolution of (R,S)-2-octanol. 
Enzyme assisted kinetic resolution of racemic compounds is much preferred over conventional chemical catalysts due to their highly regio- and stereoselective nature. The synergism with microwave irradiation is accentuated with an increased rate of the reaction without affecting the nature of the enzyme and makes the process economically viable. Much literature states the kinetic resolution of different molecules under microwave irradiation. Table 3 shows the comparison between conventional and microwave heating for the kinetic resolution of compounds, pharmaceuticals, flavors, fragrances, and paint. Yang et al.126 conducted enantioselective esterification of ibuprofen using a recombinant Aeropyrum pernix esterase enzyme. The study revealed that the enzyme activity was increased by 21.9-fold and the enantioselectivity by 1.4-fold, respectively. The results also showed that 95% of enzyme activity was maintained under low microwave power conditions. In another study, Novozym 435 was used for enantioselective transesterification of (R/S)-1-phenylpropagyl alcohol achieving 48% conversion and 93% enantiomeric excess within 2 h (Scheme 7). With microwave synergism, the initial rates were increased by up to 1.28-fold in a relatively shorter time compared with conventional heating. The results also indicated that the higher rates might not be due to pure thermal effects, but due to the microwave absorbing character of the reaction medium.127 Souza et al.128 carried out the kinetic resolution of rac-1-phenylethanol using immobilized lipases (Novozym 435, Amano PS, Amano AK, lipozyme TL IM, and lipozyme RL IM) and vinyl acetate as an acyl donor under conventional and microwave heating. Among the screened enzymes, Novozym 435 showed the highest conversion of 50% with 97% ees, 98% eep, and E > 200. The reactions were carried out in a quartz reaction vessel with 300 W magnetron output power. In another work by Yadav and Pawar,129 the kinetic resolution of DL-(±)-3-phenyllactic acid (PLA) to L-(−)-O-acetyl-3-phenyllactic acid was studied using Novozym 435 (Scheme 8). They achieved a conversion of 49% with >99% of enantiomeric excess under the optimum conditions of 0.6 mmol DL-(±)-3-PLA and 3 mmol vinyl acetate in 6 h in solvent toluene. With the application of microwave irradiation, the initial rate was observed to increase from 0.19 × 10−5 to 0.45 × 10−5 mol L−1 min−1 g−1 of the enzyme. Overall, the initial rates were increased by up to 1.8-fold under microwave irradiation compared with that under conventional heating. Similar results were observed for kinetic resolution of different secondary alcohols ((±)-1-phenyl-1-propanol, (±)-3-bromo-2-(2 hydroxypropyl)-1,4-dimethoxynaphthalene, (±)-1-(4-bromophenyl)-propan-1-ol, and (±)-1-phenylbut-3-en-1-ol) using lipase under microwave heating.

 Scheme 8  Enantioselective resolution of DL-(±)-3-phenyllactic acid under MW. 
Microwave irradiation as a tool for process intensification has been reported by many authors for various applications in different fields. In terms of energy efficiency, the efficiency of microwave energy from electrical energy is approximately 50–60%. Hence, almost 40–50% of electrical energy remains unutilized. The energy efficiency of microwave-assisted reactions also depends on factors such as the volume of the reaction, type and nature of solvent, penetration depth of microwave in the reaction mixture, and dissipation power of the microwave device utilized for the reaction. The poor efficiency can also be due to high microwave power usage in a relatively small reaction volume.85,130 For example, a transesterification reaction was conducted using vegetable oil and methanol using a continuous flow microwave reactor. The reaction was carried out under atmospheric conditions using a 4 L reaction vessel with a 1:6 molar ratio of vegetable oil and alcohol at a flow rate of 7.2 L min−1. The energy consumption calculations revealed that 94.3 kJ L−1 of energy was consumed under conventional heating, whereas 26 kJ L−1 of energy was consumed when operated under continuous flow microwave mode at 7.2 L min−1 feedstock flow.93 Thus, the effect of microwave heating can be more energy efficient as compared to conventional heating under the given conditions. Similarly, Moseley and Woodman131 studied energy efficiency under microwave and conventional heating for mesoscale organic reactions. The results revealed that microwave heating was more energy-efficient than conventional heating. However, the results can also vary and are highly dependent upon the design of the microwave reactor, the operating principle, the scale of the reaction, and the mode of operation.
5. Continuous flow reactors
5.1 Introduction
The application of biocatalysis in the field of fine chemical synthesis has drastically increased in the last few decades. Biocatalysis has been applied to different technologies such as microwave irradiation, ultrasound, and non-classical solvents such as supercritical fluids, ionic liquids (ILs), etc. Though much literature is available on biocatalytic reactions in batch processes, the use of biocatalysis in continuous processes remains to be more productive, sustainable, and can be efficiently carried out in a controlled environment.132 The transition from batch to continuous reactors involves two concepts of modern industrial biotechnology process intensification and green chemistry. Good process control makes the system efficient, minimizes waste generation, and avoids harsh mixing. Chemical catalytic methods are more favorable owing to their easy implementation and conventional catalyst behavior. To overcome the barriers and application of biocatalysis, novel process technology is required that will make the processes efficient. Continuous flow processes have emerged as an important tool in the development of new technologies. Continuous flow packed bed reactors are an effective means to intensify the process, and combined with enzyme-based catalysts, they have become key green engineering areas for the synthesis of fine chemicals. Issues of cost often dictate the design of continuous flow reactors, repeated use of biocatalysts to maximize the economy of the process, and reactor design to ensure maximum productivity.133
Packed bed reactors are an alternative to the traditional batch process and are the most commonly and extensively used reactors because of their various features such as easy reuse of the enzyme, low concentration of the substrate, long term industrial-scale production, opposite to that of batch reactors where the immobilized enzymes are susceptible to breakage or enzyme leaching due to mechanical shear stress, and cost-effectivity compared to batch stirred tank reactors. Continuous flow packed bed reactors (CFPBRs) provide a high ratio of surface area per unit volume of the reactor and no back mixing.141,142
The working principle of flow chemistry is quite simple. The reaction mixture or reactants are pumped through a reactor in a continuous mode, and the product is recovered. The pumps are grouped into two types, continuous and semi-continuous pumps. A typical example of a semi-continuous pump is a syringe pump, which requires filling, while continuous pumps do not require refilling. Continuous flow reactors are commonly made up of perfluoroalkoxy tubing and plastics. Other materials such as glass and metals are also preferred as they can withstand high temperature and pressure. Various types of continuous flow reactors are reported, which include packed bed reactors, reactor coils, micro or mesofluidic chips, cartridges, and tube-in-tube reactors.143 The main components of a biocatalytic reactor are mentioned in Fig. 5, and the general depiction of the immobilized enzyme in a packed bed reactor is shown in Fig. 6. A whole lot of literature is available on exploring whole-cell biocatalysis and the use of immobilized enzymes in continuous flow systems. In whole-cell biocatalysis, the substrate has to enter the cell for biotransformation, or the protein has to be extracted from the organism, while that with an extracted enzyme, the substrate can readily react with the enzyme. The advantages of whole-cell biocatalysis include no purification process, less expensive, no requirement of additional cofactors, and the reaction can be conducted in its native environment.144,145 The disadvantages include less permeation of the substrate and product due to the cell membrane, slow reaction, formation of unwanted chemicals or byproducts due to undesirable metabolic pathways, complicated processes, and fouling due to cell debris and residual products which complicate the downstream process.146 Purified enzymes have an advantage over whole-cell biocatalysts as they are highly specific, reduce byproduct formation, and are promiscuous towards a wide range of substrates.147 Their disadvantages include being highly expensive, denaturation due to external environmental conditions and the requirement of additional cofactors. Enzyme immobilization is of prime importance for the success of biocatalytic continuous flow processes because enzyme deactivation is always a concern and should be taken into consideration during its process development.148 Immobilized enzymes are easily separated from the reaction medium, thereby simplifying downstream operations and eliminating product contamination. Immobilization enhances the enzyme stability and facilitates the reuse of costly enzymes. Thus, immobilization is an important step towards cost-effective enzymatic processes.149 Hence, this part mainly focuses on applications of immobilized enzymes in different reactions of industrial importance in continuous flow processes.

5.2 Applications of immobilized enzymes in continuous flow reactors
Palm oil was transesterified in a packed bed reactor using Pseudomonas fluorescens lipase.150 The enzyme was immobilized on an epoxy polysiloxane–PVA composite (epoxy–SiO2–PVA). A steady-state yield of 87% was achieved at a flow rate of 1.5 mL h−1 with tert-butanol as a solvent. High biocatalyst operational stability was observed with 48 days of half-life, and almost 70% of the enzyme activity was retained after 48 days of continuous operation. In another study, xylooligosaccharides were continuously produced from xylan in a CFPBR using immobilized xylanase. The enzyme was supported by different methacrylic polymers for immobilization and activated with glyoxyl groups. 90% of catalytic efficiency was maintained during the operation time of 120 h, and a specific productivity of 3277 gxos genzyme−1 h−1 was achieved at a flow rate of 10 mL min−1. Also, a comparative study was undertaken in batch and continuous modes, wherein a 17-fold higher specific productivity was obtained in a PBR. The continuous flow system showed good operational stability and allowed kinetic control of xylan reaction products.151
Wiles et al.152 investigated the performance of chemo-enzymatic oxidation of alkenes in a continuous flow process with Novozym 435. The process consisted of lipase-catalyzed in situ generation of peracetic acid from ethyl acetate and hydrogen peroxide. The peracetic acid oxidizes the substrate 1-methylcyclohexene to form 1-methylcyclohexene oxide (Scheme 9). ∼100% conversion was achieved with a space-time yield of 646 g L−1 per day. With the application of a packed bed reactor, higher quantities of H2O2 could be used for a prolonged period of 24 h without significant deactivation of the enzyme. The study was further extended to the epoxidation of an array of aliphatic and aromatic alkenes giving higher yields under the optimized conditions.153
 Scheme 9  Chemo-enzymatic oxidation of 1-methylcyclohexene in a continuous flow reactor. 
Sutili and coworkers154 reported the esterification of sterically hindered fructose derivatives in batch and continuous flow reactors using Lipozyme TL IM, Lipozyme RM IM, Novozym 435, and PS Amano (Burkholderia cepacia). The esterification reaction of fructose ketal with palmitic acid yielded fructose mono-palmitate (Scheme 10). The experimental conditions of enzyme and substrate concentrations and temperature were varied using the design of experiments for the batch reaction and then translated to the continuous flow regime with a short residence time and higher conversions. Lipozyme RM IM was found to be the optimum catalyst, achieving 93% under a flow rate of 0.05 mL min−1. In 2019, Guerrero et al.155 carried out the continuous synthesis of lactulose from fructose and lactose using Aspergillus oryzae β-galactosidase immobilized on a glyoxyl-agarose support (Scheme 11). The effect of the substrate molar ratio, feed flow rate, and immobilized enzyme on the inert packing material mass ratio was evaluated based on the reactor performance. The increase in any of the reaction conditions gave increased product and time on stream yields as compared to those in a batch reactor. The maximum yield of 0.6 g g−1 was achieved at a flow rate of 15 mL min−1, and the effect of recirculation on CFPBR performance was also assessed. The recycle with reactor operation had no significant effect on the yield, and the biocatalyst was quite stable.

5.3 Microreactor technology
The enzyme reactors can be scaled down to small microfluidic reaction devices such as microchip-type of microreactors or microcapillary devices for operation in continuous mode. Microreactors are reactors of extremely small dimensions with a sandwich-like structure consisting of a large number of layers with microchannels. These devices have a large surface to volume ratio, high efficiency, require micro- or nanoliter volumes of reaction mixtures, and exhibit good reusability.179–182 The continuous flow of chemical processing in these microfluidic devices is based on a combination of microunit operations such as reaction, extraction, and mixing. The chemical processing microchips for the design of microreactors are built as a combination of different microunit operations.183 Microreactor technology provides an excellent means to fulfill the demands of rapid process development in industries efficiently. The continuous flow microreactors provide enhanced mass and heat transfer, which helps in process intensification, especially during multiphase biocatalytic processes. The scale-down of reactors to the micro-scale also helps enzymatic reactions as the diffusional limitations are reduced, achieving excellent results in less production time.184 The microreactor technology can be applied at an industrial scale specifically for hazardous reactions such as high-temperature reactions, exothermic reactions, or reactions with unstable intermediates that are difficult to scale up.185 The utilization of continuous flow reactors offers excellent process intensification. A few examples of immobilized enzymatic reactions applied in microreactors are summarized in Table 5.

Continuous transamination of (S)-1-phenylethanamine in a microreactor with immobilized biocatalysts was carried out by Miložič et al.186 The study was conducted in a microscale reactor with surface-immobilized amine-transaminase. Wild type transaminase from a crude cell extract and E. coli cells, which were intracellularly overexpressed in the enzyme, were immobilized on the surface of meander microchannels of disposable plastics. The immobilization was carried out by means of surface salinization and crosslinking with glutaraldehyde. Further, the wild type transaminase was genetically engineered to contain a silica binding module for the immobilization on the non-modified inner glass microchannel surface. The biotransformation of (S)-1-phenylethanamine and pyruvate produces acetophenone and L-alanine catalyzed by amine-transaminase in the presence of cofactor pyridoxal 5-phosphate (Scheme 12). The surface immobilization of E. coli cells overexpressing amine-transaminase proved to be the most promising approach giving high volumetric productivity up to 14.42 g L−1 h−1. The study shows the prospective of microreactor technology with diverse immobilization strategies and in-operando comparison biocatalysts, which can be successfully transferred to a production scale. Furthermore, the enzyme surface kinetics based on the ping-pong bi-bi mechanism was studied.187

The immobilization of the enzyme on the microchannel surface is one of the promising methods for the integration of the enzyme into the microstructure of the reactor. Bolivar and coworkers188 immobilized sucrose phosphorylase enzyme from Leuconostoc mesenteroides on a solid support using a polycationic binding module with single step non-covalent immobilization on different porous supports. The microstructured flow channel reactor had an immobilized enzyme on the microchannel walls. The immobilized enzyme was used for selective transglucosylation of sucrose to glycerol using immobilized sucrose phosphorylase. The efficiency of the non-covalent immobilization method was similar to the multipoint covalent attachment of the enzyme on epoxy-activated supports. The microreactor was continuously operated for 16 days and had 10 days of operational half-life with a space-time yield of 500 mmol of product L−1 h−1. Similarly, lipase from Phycomyces nitens was immobilized on a mesoporous silica thin film inside a microreactor.189 The thin film with immobilized lipase without any chemical modification was used for continuous ester hydrolysis of 4-nitrophenyl acetate (Scheme 13).

5.4 Fluidized bed bioreactors
Fluidized bed reactors present many advantages, which make them an attractive alternative for enzymatic reactions. Fluidized bed reactors are reactors with immobilized particles within a column that are in movement due to liquid flow. The immobilized particles or catalysts are retained in the reactant stream due to the control of hydrodynamic and drag forces of up-flow and gravity.190 Fluidized bed reactors (FBRs) are less prone to column clogging, compression of the catalyst due to bed weight, and formation of preferential flow paths.191 Moreover, the fluidizing velocity and the residence time of the substrate can be controlled separately. Thus, a circulating FBR is more productive from a fixed amount of enzyme than that can be achieved in the batch reactor. The application of immobilized enzymes in fluidized bed reactors was recorded in the early 1980s for hydrolysis of cornstarch192 and maltodextrin.193 Fidalgo et al.194 employed a fluidized bed reactor for the production of biodiesel by ethanolysis of babassu oil with simultaneous glycerol removal using Novozym 435. The best performance was attained at a space-time of 8 h and a yield of 98% of fatty acid ethyl esters. The hydrodynamic study with pulse tracer trails showed the flow pattern of a continuous flow stirred tank reactor. Piao et al.195 developed a treating system for bisphenol A with high efficiency in a fluidized reactor with immobilized laccase. The laccase enzyme was immobilized on mesoporous silica by cross-linking with glutaraldehyde. The biotransformation of bisphenol A by immobilized laccase was very fast. Almost 90% of 25 mg L−1 bisphenol A was degraded in 8 h under a flow rate of 7.2 mL min−1. The application of the enzymatic fluidized bed reactor was further extended to the food and cosmetic industries for the production of geranyl butyrate and continuous lysis of lactic bacteria in wine using lysozyme immobilized on spherical chitosan supports.196 The continuous production of geranyl butyrate was conducted with CRL immobilized on weak-acidic macroporous cation exchange resin D151 in organic solvent n-heptane. 77% ester yield was attained under the steady-state conditions of 4.7 h residence time at 40 °C.167
The fluidized bed reactor was also used in the food industry for 6-O-lauryl mannose synthesis. The esterification of D-mannose with lactic acid was conducted using lipase in a fluidized bed reactor (Scheme 14). The circulating FBR consisted of a circulating system, a feeder, a discharging system, and a temperature control system, and the reactor was made up of a glass column. The substrate flow rate was maintained at 1.0 mL min−1, and the productivity contributed to about 59.26 g L−1 d−1 yield. The process enhanced the monoester selectivity over mannose diester, contributing to selective biosynthesis of monolauryl mannose.197 Jakovetic et al. demonstrated the lipase-catalyzed synthesis of ethyl cinnamate in a fluidized bed bioreactor (Scheme 15). A comparative study between fluidized bed and batch reactors proved that the reaction was much faster in the fluidized bed reactor than the batch reactor.

 Scheme 15  Esterification of cinnamic acid and ethyl alcohol to produce ethyl cinnamate using lipase B in a fluidized bed reactor. 
Furthermore, the solid–liquid mass transfer co-efficient was estimated for both reactors to determine the mass transfer limitations. The calculation of the Thiele modulus and Damköhler numbers confirmed that there were no mass transfer limitations in either of the bioreactors.207
5.5 Kinetic resolution in continuous flow reactors
Enzymatic kinetic resolution has proved to be an excellent strategy to produce enantiomerically pure compounds. The enzymatic kinetic resolution of alcohols is of great interest due to their key role in different synthetic routes. Continuous lipase-catalyzed kinetic resolution of alcohols and amines was carried out by Bassut et al.208 The kinetic resolution of (R,S)-1-phenylethanol and (R,S)-1-phenylethylamine was achieved with high yields and enantiopurity. The immobilized enzyme remained active for 20 h of reaction. The method presented a short reaction time with the use of a continuous flow packed bed reactor. Aguillón et al.209 measured the performance of 16 immobilized lipases in a PBR for the kinetic resolution of (±)-1,2-propanediol. Novozym 435 (N435) gave the maximum conversion. However, the other immobilized enzymes, such as CAL B on epoxy resin, gave similar results to N435, which can be an excellent alternative for N435. The continuous flow reactor reduced the time from 6 h in batch to 7 min. The use of a continuous flow reactor enhanced the reaction yield three times as compared to a conventional batch reactor giving 50% conversion and selectivity (E value > 200).
Similarly, Kamble and Yadav211 conducted the kinetic resolution of (R,S)-α-tetralol using a flow chemistry approach with Novozym 435 in a packed bed reactor (Scheme 16). The maximum conversion of 50% was achieved in 3 min residence time with 100% (R)-α-tetralol selectivity. The high conversion was attributed to no back mixing and laminar plug flow in the packed bed reactor. Porcar et al.210 carried out the synthesis of chiral enantiopure 1-(2-hydroxycycloalkyl)imidazoles in continuous flow processes with immobilized CAL B. They also examined the batch vs. continuous flow process and in all situations, the continuous flow packed bed reactor gave better results compared to the batch reactor. The kinetic resolution of (+)-(S/R)-1-[(1S,5R)-6,6-dimethylbicycloij[3.1.0]hex-2-en-2yl] ethanol (diastereoisomeric alcohol) (Scheme 17) using Pseudomonas cepacia lipase (PSL) in a structured monolithic enzymatic microreactor was carried out by Strub et al.212 The enzyme was adsorbed on a single monolith. The siliceous rods were prepared by the sol–gel method and applied as microreactors. The experiments conducted in the CFPBR showed high substrate conversions with low residence time (<2 min) and a remarkable space-time yield of 100 g h−1 L−1. At a flow rate of 0.45 mL min−1, >99% of the target substrate was fully transformed.

5.6 Application of supercritical fluids with a continuous reactor
Continuous flow reactors were further combined with supercritical fluids to enhance yields. Bourkaib et al.213 studied the enzymatic synthesis of geranyl acetate in a packed bed reactor using supercritical CO2 (scCO2) as a green solvent with Lipozyme 435 as an immobilized catalyst (Scheme 18). The highest conversion of 73% was obtained at 65 °C and 150 bar pressure producing 5 g of geranyl acetate per gram of enzyme per h. Similarly, Escandell et al.214 carried out butyl acetate synthesis in a packed bed reactor of lipase. The effect of conventional solvents such as n-hexane and green solvent supercritical CO2 was investigated. The solvent n-hexane gave the maximum productivity of 119 μmol min−1 g of pellets, whereas supercritical CO2 gave 501 μmol min−1 g of pellets under 12 MPa pressure. The use of a supercritical fluid makes the process eco-friendly and reduces the environmental impact. Furthermore, Székely et al.215 carried out the kinetic resolution of trans-1,2-cyclohexanediol in a continuous reactor with scCO2 as a solvent using immobilized lipase CAL B. The continuous enzymatic supercritical reactor yielded 6 times higher productivity than that with a batch reactor achieving enantiomeric excess of >99% in a mean residence time of 10 s.

6. Ultrasound-assisted reactions
6.1 Introduction
Ultrasound is one of the intensification techniques used in several biological and chemical processes, such as enzymatic reactions. The effect of ultrasound is used to accelerate the rate of reactions and product yields. Enzymatic reactions require a significantly long reaction time and are rate limited. Hence, using other techniques to enhance reaction rates has attracted much interest. The application of ultrasound has various advantages such as high efficiency, low energy consumption, and no pollution. Ultrasound can be used as a physical modification method and is known to alter the properties of the product and accelerate the rate of reaction in a lab-scale as well as for large scale processes owing to its radical and mechanical effects. Ultrasound changes the conformation of the enzyme and modifies its functionality, promoting the interaction between the substrate and enzyme.216
Cavitation is a dynamic phenomenon induced by ultrasound, with strong effects depending on operating parameters achieving rate enhancement. Ultrasound can have both positive and adverse effects on enzymes, depending upon the low and high intensity of ultrasound used. The study of the ultrasound promoting effect on enzymatic reactions is of prime importance as it can influence the operating conditions required for designing efficient ultrasound-assisted reactions. The mass transfer rate is a vital constraint owing to enzymatic reactions. The mass transfer limitations can lead to lower conversions and reaction rates. These limitations can be overcome with the use of ultrasound. Ultrasound and enzymes can have a synergistic effect by diminishing the diffusion limiting barrier between the enzyme and substrate molecules. This drastically increases the mass transfer rate of the reaction.217 The acceleration of enzyme-catalyzed reactions is due to the ultrasonic cavitation effect. The cavitation process leads to the formation of acoustic streaming, which transmits into the reaction system and improves the overall mass transfer rate. Ultrasonic cavitation generates active radicals that react with intermediate molecules hindering enzyme inactivation. Further, ultrasound also modifies enzymes and substrates, increasing the surface area of substrates. The effect of ultrasound exposes the active site of the enzyme, helping in the acceleration of enzymatic processes.
Furthermore, it reduces the activation energy of the reaction system, overall decreasing the energy barrier required for the reaction. It has been observed that the effect of both chemical and physical effects of ultrasound has a positive effect on enzyme-catalyzed reactions.
6.2 Ultrasound mechanism
Ultrasound is an acoustic wave that requires a medium to propagate and has a frequency greater than 20 kHz.218 Ultrasound waves similar to mechanical waves can lead to multiple compression and rarefaction processes while passing through a medium. During the traveling of ultrasound waves through the medium, at one point, the amplitude of these ultrasonic waves exceeds the threshold level resulting in “cavitation”. Acoustic cavitation occurs in two modes, namely, stable cavitation and transient cavitation. Microbubbles do not grow and reach a critical size before collapsing when operated at small acoustic pressure, which results in stable acoustic cavitation. On the other hand, in transient cavitation, at high acoustic pressure, microbubbles grow rapidly and start collapsing as they reach the critical size. The instantaneous explosion of microbubbles can generate extreme pressure up to 100 MPa and temperature up to 5000 K.219–221
The energy released during the collapsing produces shear forces and shockwaves, resulting in strong turbulence in the surrounding environment. These mechanical effects enhance the mass transfer rate and improve the substrate dissolution through cavitation, improving the mass and heat transfer and blending of reactants in the reaction medium. The consecutive breakdown of cavitation bubbles generates physical effects like the formation of microjets, shock waves, shear forces, and turbulence. The effects generate local heat and pressure, which ultimately enhances the rate of mass transfer.222 In ultrasound, the rate of mass transfer is increased by physical turbulence. Cavitation brings thermal, physical, and chemical effects on the reaction medium. Because of microbubble collapse, water is dissociated, and oxygen molecules are released, leading to highly reactive free radicals (˙OH, ˙OOH), helping in combining and reacting with other molecules.223,224Fig. 7 depicts the process of acoustic cavitation, and the effects involved, such as nucleation, diffusion, radical, shock wave, and microjet formation.

6.3 Overview of ultrasound-assisted enzymatic reactions
The effect of ultrasound assistance is known to increase the rate of reaction by several folds as compared to that under conventional heating. The difference in the microenvironment of the reaction medium is due to physical effects by cavitation. These effects contribute to enhancing the rate of reaction.225Table 6 illustrates the application of immobilized enzymes in ultrasound-assisted reactions, and Table 7 compares the reactions carried out in a batch reactor and ultrasound reactor.

Sivaramakrishnan and Incharoensakdi226 investigated the transesterification of Botryococcus sp. oil under ultrasound treatment for the synthesis of methyl esters. Glycerol carbonate and glycerol dicarbonate were the by-products obtained. CAL B immobilized on a celite support was utilized for the reaction. Dimethyl carbonate acts as a transesterification reagent and substrate. The maximum yield of 88% methyl esters along with glycerol carbonate (2.7%), glycerol dicarbonate (5.7%), and glycerol (0.43%) was obtained in 4 h and 36 h, under ultrasound irradiation and without ultrasound, respectively, to achieve the maximum yield. A tank-type sonicator with 30 kHz frequency and 200 W was used.
They observed that the ultrasound treatment significantly accelerates the synthesis of methyl esters irrespective of the type of substrate and catalyst used. The micro convection results in strong shear forces, achieving enhanced product formation in a relatively short duration. Also, the synergism between ultrasound and mechanical agitation in the reaction mass clearly indicated that ultrasound had more influence than stirring. The lipase-catalyzed production of diacylglycerol by partial hydrolysis of soyabean oil under ultrasound irradiation was investigated by Babicz et al.243Scheme 19 shows the overall lipase-catalyzed transesterification reaction for biodiesel production.
 Scheme 19  Overall reaction for the lipase-catalyzed transesterification reaction under US. 
Fantozzi et al.246 carried out the synthesis of biodiesel using Burkholderia cepacia lipase with ultrasound-assisted technology as an alternative source of bioenergy. The reaction was carried out in a scaled-up reactor of 3 L capacity, achieving 55.2% biodiesel conversion in 4 h with a viscosity of 10.31 mm2 s−1. This result was attributed to ultrasonic effects due to cavitation and acoustic waves, which develop high temperatures and pressure facilitating proper contact between the alcohol and lipid molecules at the interface. The emulsification due to cavitation produces stable microemulsions, which give high catalytic activity due to the increased interfacial surface area between the molecules.
The combination of irradiation and emulsification using ultrasound has a synergistic effect on the transesterification reaction. Ngadi et al.247 investigated the ultrasound-assisted enzymatic production of biodiesel using waste tallow. The study was carried out using immobilized CAL B, and the effect of various ultrasonic operating parameters such as amplitude, cycle, and pulse was thoroughly studied. The maximum biodiesel yield was found to be 85.6% under the operating conditions of 14 molar ratio of fat methanol, 6% catalyst loading, and 40% ultrasonic amplitude at 5 Hz in 20 min reaction time. Also, the kinetics of the transesterification reaction was studied, which suggested the ping pong bi bi mechanism of the reaction.
The applications of ultrasound can be found in the food industry for the hydrolysis of various products. Mazutti et al.248 used ultrasound-assisted enzymatic hydrolysis of yam for fermentable sugar production. The hydrolysis was carried out in both the presence and absence of ultrasound. The results suggested that ultrasound increased the yield emerging as a promising technology to be applied for hydrolysis. The maximum amount of fermentable sugar obtained without ultrasound was 0.32 g sugar per g of dry material and with ultrasound 0.42 g sugar per g of dry material.
In another study by Wang et al.,255 the effect of ultrasound on hydrolysis of soy oil was studied using Candida lipolytica lipase. It was observed that the interfacial area between the aqueous phase and the oil phase has a great influence on the hydrolysis rate. The application of ultrasound was found to be more effective for the dispersion of oil in aqueous water. The maximum initial rate of hydrolysis obtained was 161 mol m−3min under an ultrasonic power of 1.64 W cm−2. Similarly, the effect of ultrasound assistance on hydrolysis of various materials such as starch catalyzed by glucoamylase,256 sucrose catalyzed invertase,257 sugarcane bagasse for the production of fermentable sugars,258 palm oil for the synthesis of diacylglycerol,259 cellulose260 and palm oil261 was investigated. The studies confirmed that the significant intensification of enzymatic hydrolysis was a result of ultrasound assistance.
Bhanage et al.262 reported the increased biocatalytic activity of Pseudomonas cepacia lipase under sonicated conditions for the greener synthesis of cinnamyl propionate and various industrially relevant propionate esters. Scheme 20 shows the synthesis of cinnamyl propionate using vinyl propionate and cinnamyl alcohol under ultrasound irradiation using Pseudomonas cepacia lipase. A copolymer of hydroxypropyl methylcellulose and polyvinyl alcohol was used for the immobilization of the enzyme. The immobilized enzyme was characterized using thermogravimetry, water content analysis, and scanning electron microscopy. In addition, a comparative study of the immobilized and free enzymes with respect to time was performed under US. The result showed that the free enzyme yielded only 20%, which was 5 times lower than that of the immobilized enzyme under ultrasound. The lower activity of the free enzyme was due to its direct exposure to the outer sonication medium, whereas the higher activity of the immobilized enzyme was due to the protection of the enzyme from exposure to sonication due to immobilization. About 99% conversion of cinnamyl propionate was achieved with a 12 mole ratio of cinnamyl alcohol, vinyl propionate, 23 mg of catalyst loading, solvent n-hexane, temperature of 40 °C at 33 kHz frequency, 100 W power, and 66.6% duty cycle in a reaction time of 1.5 h and the developed catalyst was recyclable up to five cycles. Sonochemical lipase-catalyzed regioselective acylation of flavonoid glycosides was carried out by Ziaullah and Rupasinghe.263 Quercetin-3-O-glucoside and phloretin-20-glucoside with various fatty acids were acylated using Novozym 435 under ultrasound irradiation. Scheme 21 depicts the lipase-catalyzed acylation of quercetin-3-O-glucoside with various acids under ultrasound irradiation. They conducted a comparative study between ultrasound irradiation and conventional heating, stating that ultrasound irradiation increased the rate reaction and reduced the time by 4–5 fold. The reaction was conducted in an ultrasonic bath of 20 kHz frequency and 1000 w power. The highest yield of 96% was achieved for esterification of isoquercitrin with stearic acid.

Glucose oxidase, in combination with β-galactosidase, was used for selective oxidation of glucose to gluconic acid and galactooligosaccharide production under ultrasound irradiation. The highest yields of galactooligosaccharide were achieved at the lowest concentration of glucose and the highest production of gluconic acid in the presence of ultrasound. The work demonstrated the ability of ultrasound irradiation to enhance the efficiency of galactooligosaccharide to obtain a prebiotic mixture with a low glycaemic index using a multi enzymatic system.264
6.4 Combination of ultrasound assistance with a packed bed reactor
Ultrasound irradiation was coupled with a continuous flow packed bed reactor for esterification of soybean fatty acid for the synthesis of FAME using Novozym 435. The optimized reaction conditions were a fatty acid to alcohol ratio of 16, temperature of 65 °C, irradiation power of 61.6 W, and flow rate of 2.5 mL min−1, achieving almost complete conversions. The packed bed system was made up of a tubular reactor made of polyethylene (200 cm × 4.2 mm) using an ultrasonic water bath (154 W power and 40 kHz frequency). With ultrasound irradiation, substrate mixing is efficient, overcoming the mass transfer limitation.265 In another study by Lee et al.,266 the production of octyl hydroxyphenylpropionate (OHPP) was carried out in an ultrasound-assisted packed bed reactor using Novozym 435 (Scheme 22). Phenolic compounds are usually secondary metabolites possessing antibacterial, anticancer, and anti-inflammatory properties. The assembly consisted of a long stainless-steel tube (25 cm) packed with 1 g of catalyst Novozym 435. The column was immersed in an ultrasonic water bath operating at 40 kHz and power 1.74 W cm−2. The operating parameters were evaluated using response surface methodology (RSM) and 3-factor Box–Behnken design. The optimum conditions predicted were a temperature of 65 °C, 0.05 mL min−1 flow rate, and power of 1.74 Wcm−2, which yielded 99.33% of OHPP from p-hydroxyphenylpropionic acid and octanol. The study indicated that the flow rate and reaction temperature were the important variables affecting the yield of OHPP. A similar approach was followed by Chen et al.267 using a continuous ultrasound-assisted packed bed reactor with lipase for the production of caffeic acid phenethyl ester. The ultrasound assistance helps in enhancing the rate of reaction due to the collision effect. The ultrasound-assisted packed bed reactor not only increases the synthesis efficiency but also decreases the reaction time. The approach of a combination of ultrasound assistance with a continuous flow packed bed reactor can be considered as a potential alternative for industrial application.

7. Concluding remarks
This review provides an insight into the application of immobilized enzymes in various reactions of industrial relevance, discussing the areas of application, the effect of process intensification on the yield, and the observed enhancement as compared to conventional processes by highlighting some typical examples. The emerging demand for mild conditions and green catalysts to produce different chemicals has encouraged the application of biocatalysis in all fields of industries. Enzyme immobilization is the key solution in developing a cost-effective process. Under the optimized conditions and controlling the process parameters (time, rpm, temperature, and enzyme loading), enzymes can work as excellent catalysts in biotransformations.
Microwave irradiation is a rapid, simple, and efficient method to promote the rate of reaction in the industrial biocatalytic process for process intensification. The use of microwave irradiation for process enhancement and enzyme stability can prove to be advantageous as compared with conventional heating. The microwave effect on the biocatalytic process involves thermal effects such as superheating and hot spots, and non-thermal effects such as molecular mobility. The scale-up of microwave-assisted enzymatic reactions is still a challenge due to limitations such as enzyme sensitivity and poor microwave penetration power, which can be further explored and has tremendous growth potential for future work.
Continuous flow reactors are one of the most important powerful tools for process intensification in various industrially relevant reactions. The utilization of enzymatic continuous flow reactors shows great potential at large scale operations. However, there is still scope for improvement in productivity, reactor volume, and efficient enzyme immobilization strategies. With the advent of continuous flow technology, strategic parameters can be improved, such as energy efficiency, reaction time, and down streaming processes for industrial manufacturing. The enormous growth in the adoption of continuous flow processes is due to commercially available technology and great industrial interest. The biocatalytic continuous flow processes are increasing tremendously in both industry and academia and are undergoing their own revolution.
Ultrasound technology is an efficient alternative technology to enhance the rate of enzymatic reaction primarily through the effect of cavitation. Acoustic cavitation is the growth and collapse of microbubbles. Cavitation generates hot spots, reactive free radicals, and turbulence, which can result in the intensification of diverse enzymatic operations. However, to obtain better yields, the operating conditions such as frequency, temperature, time, amplitude, and pH need to be standardized. The application of ultrasound is a topic of much interest due to low its energy requirements, low processing time, and improved functional properties of enzymes and is considered a green technology that can be industrially applied.
The use of immobilized enzymes in industrial biotechnology is expanding drastically. The significant growth in the adoption of enzymes in commercial applications has stimulated attention for enhancing enzyme functionality and stability, and enzyme immobilization is the most direct means to accomplish this purpose. In light of the increasing demand for sustainable and environmentally friendly production processes, biocatalysis has a steady growth in industry. The integration of enzyme-catalysed reactions with process intensification techniques will become more pronounced in the near future.
