    , Accepted 11th April 2017First published on 12th April 2017AbstractBare naphthalene units bonded via the α- and β-positions as side chain substituents on an asymmetric benzodithiophene (BDT) building block were employed in the design of new light-harvesting polymers for the first time. Accordingly, two D–A type polymers, based on naphthyl-substituted BDT as a D-building block and the well-known 4,7-di(thiophen-2-ethylhexyl)-5,6-difluoro-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (DTffBT) as an acceptor unit, were synthesized. The polymer PBDTβNPFBT with naphthalene bonded via the β-position exhibits an appropriate π–π distance. The naphthalene rings efficiently broaden the absorption and narrow the optical band gap (Eoptg), by extending the degree of π-conjugation, which is beneficial for capturing more photons and thus improving the short-circuit current density (JSC). Meanwhile, PBDTβNPFBT-based devices also exhibit a desirable high open circuit voltage (VOC), due to the low saturation dark current density (JS) arising from the exactly appropriate π–π distance. As a result, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 9.80% for the PBDTβNPFBT/PC71BM-based PSC is the highest efficiency ever obtained among the reported BDT and DTBT backbone photovoltaic polymers. In addition, a PCE of 7.33% was obtained for PBDTβNPFBT/ITIC without any treatment, which is also impressive for non-fullerene PSCs. Thus, it can be concluded that a naphthyl unit bonded via the β-position can lead to a better trade-off between Eoptg and VOC, ultimately increasing the PCE dramatically.
Introduction
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) based on bulk heterojunction (BHJ) architecture have recently experienced rapid progress. Now, power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) have surpassed 11% due to the development of materials in combination with device engineering.1–4 Recently, vigorous efforts have been devoted to developing non-fullerene acceptors, such as ITIC, leading to prominent breakthroughs in photovoltaic performance.5–7 In practice, to be matched well with fullerene or non-fullerene acceptors, the donor polymer plays a critical role. For designing highly efficient donor materials, many intrinsic factors, such as solubility, molecular weight, molecular stacking, charge transport, energy levels, and absorption properties, need to be taken into account.
Among the reported high-performance donor polymers, benzodithiophene (BDT) is an attractive building block due to its planarity and high hole mobility.8–14 To further optimize this unit, we have previously designed and synthesized a series of novel asymmetric BDTs.15 In this kind of structure, it is interesting that most of the limiting factors can be remarkably improved. On one hand, by introducing a phenyl group as one side chain on the BDT unit, the degree of conjugation can be extended and a high open circuit voltage (VOC) arising from tuning the molecular energy levels can be achieved. On the other hand, an alkoxyl group as another side chain on the BDT unit can improve the solubility and degree of polymerization. In addition, it also triggers a modulation of the preferential ordered microstructure, leading to optimized molecular stacking and a shortened π–π distance. This enhances the π–π overlap between the extended conjugated phenyl units more effectively, which is beneficial for charge transport. As a result, the device based on the polymer PBDTDTffBT-H, without any processing additives or post-treatment, shows the highest PCE of 9.44% among the BDT and DTBT backbone polymers reported in literature. However, for the backbone polymers with an asymmetric structure, the absorption properties are still a key limiting factor preventing the achievement of higher efficiencies in fullerene-based PSCs. As we know, a narrow Eg and broad absorption can ensure that sufficient photons are captured, thus achieving a high short-circuit current density (JSC).16,17 In these asymmetric polymers that we reported, the optical band gaps (Eoptg) were larger than 1.75 eV, which limited the improvement of JSC. Thus, in an asymmetric system, narrowing the Eg and broadening the absorption spectrum are the primary considerations. As an effective approach, enhancing the intermolecular π–π interactions by extending the degree of π–π conjugation and shortening the π–π stacking distance can help in attaining strong visible light absorption.18 However, the strong intermolecular π–π interactions also lead to a high saturation dark current density (JS), and hence, a correspondingly lower VOC.19 In addition, the energy levels will also be changed due to the modification of the absorption properties. For example, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level will be increased, resulting in a low VOC. Thus, for improving the absorption of high-performance donor polymers, achieving appropriate intermolecular π–π interactions is essential. In other words, there is a trade-off between Eoptg and VOC. Although some non-fullerene acceptors, such as ITIC, exhibit complementary absorption with donor polymers,20–22 the trade-off feature cannot be ignored.
In this regard, we chose naphthalene rings as one side substituted group and connected them to the asymmetric BDT building blocks via the α- and β-positions. We synthesized two polymers (Fig. 1) using the well-known acceptor unit, 4,7-di(thiophen-2-ethylhexyl)-5,6-difluoro-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (DTffBT). Naphthalene has a high ionization potential and low electron density, which can ensure that the essential low-lying HOMO level will maintain a decent VOC. Furthermore, naphthalene exhibits a higher activity and has more π electrons than benzene, which increases the degree of conjugation efficiently. Using these two polymers, we explored the effects of different extended conjugation orientations and intermolecular π–π interactions on Eoptg and VOC, with the aim of finding the optimal balance between them. In particular, utilizing naphthalene rings without any alkyl side chain substituent can enhance the lamellar stacking and reduce the stacking influence on photovoltaic performance. As a result, the polymer PBDTβNPFBT showed a broad absorption and narrow Eoptg (1.70 eV), and hence, an increased JSC of 15.53 mA cm−2. Meanwhile, the VOC still maintained a high value (0.89 V) and the highest PCE of 9.80% among all BDT-DTBT backbone polymers was achieved. Moreover, the PCE value was close to that of the star polymer PffBT4T-2OD1 without a BDT donor unit, and was much higher than those of other non-BDT-based polymers, such as P-ehDF23 and PDTP–DFBT24 with dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]silole (DTS) and dithienopyran (DTP) as donor units, respectively. By contrast, although the polymer PBDTαNPFBT showed a higher VOC (0.91 V), the JSC (12.61 mA cm−2) obtained was a much lower value due to the quite weak intermolecular π–π interactions, which resulted in a lower PCE of 8.02%. Similar results have also been obtained in non-fullerene ITIC-based devices. Thus, we believe that naphthalene bonded via the β-position in the symmetry-breaking BDT building blocks can adjust the intermolecular π–π interactions towards optimized conditions, leading to a good trade-off between Eoptg and VOC and achieving high photovoltaic performance.

Results and discussion
The synthetic routes for the monomers and corresponding polymers are outlined in Scheme S1,† and the synthetic procedures are described in the (ESI†). The key intermediates 1 and 2 were prepared using Grignard reagent. The polymers were obtained through Stille polymerization using Pd2(dba)3 and P(o-tol)3 as catalysts. The structures of the polymers were confirmed by 1H NMR spectroscopy. The polymer PBDTαNPFBT showed good solubility in common organic solvents, such as chloroform, THF and o-dichlorobenzene, while the isomer polymer PBDTβNPFBT was dissolved partially in hot chloroform and THF and then dissolved completely in heated o-dichlorobenzene, due to the different degree of twisting. The number-average molecular weight (Mn) and polydispersity index (PDI) were measured by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) using THF as the eluent and polystyrene as the internal standard at 40 °C. The Mn values of PBDTαNPFBT and PBDTβNPFBT were calculated to be 76.3 and 78.5 kDa, respectively (Table 1). The desirable degree of polymerization can be attributed to weak steric hindrance effect from two bare naphthalene rings.15 The thermal properties of the polymers were determined by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), as shown in Fig. S1.† The TGA results reveal that the onset temperatures with 5% weight-loss (Td) of PBDTαNPFBT and PBDTβNPFBT are 335 and 353 °C, respectively (Table 1). These values indicate that the thermal stability of the polymers is good enough for PSC applications.

In order to understand the packing differences for these two polymers, density functional theory (DFT) was used to gain insight into their geometries. In this work, one repeating unit was chosen, and a methyl group was used to replace the alkyl substituent to simplify the calculations. As shown in Fig. 2a, the dihedral angles of PBDTαNPFBT and PBDTβNPFBT in the main chain are almost the same and relatively small, which is attributed to the non-covalent attractive interactions between strong polar fluorine atoms on the BT units and sulfur atoms in neighbouring thiophene rings.25,26 However, the dihedral angles between the naphthyl units of the side chains and the BDT backbone are different, at about 76° and 58° for PBDTαNPFBT and PBDTβNPFBT, respectively. The higher twisting is beneficial for improving the solubility, but the intermolecular π–π interactions are also weakened to a greater extent.

To further elucidate the intermolecular stacking, the microstructures of these two polymer films were characterized using a grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) method. As shown in Fig. 2b, the out-of-plane and in-plane GIWAXS profiles of these two polymer films show almost the same lamellar stacking (100) peaks and lamellar distance (d100). In contrast, only PBDTβNPFBT shows the π–π stacking (010) peak (qz = 16.75 nm−1, d010 = 3.75 Å) in the out-of-plane direction, indicating the existence of some face-on orientations. This can be ascribed to the better planarity of PBDTβNPFBT, which agrees well with the molecular geometries obtained through DFT calculations.
The above results indicate the quite different intermolecular stacking of these two polymers in the films, as schematically shown in Fig. 2c. The two bonding positions have minimal impact on the molecular lamellar orientation of the polymers, but have a tremendous effect on the intermolecular π–π stacking. PBDTβNPFBT shows stronger aggregations than its isomer PBDTαNPFBT in the (010) stacking orientation, which would be beneficial for the absorption of visible light and charge transport. In comparison with the polymer PBDTDTffBT-H15 with the bare phenyl side chain we reported previously, the appropriately longer π–π stacking distance (3.75 Å) in PBDTβNPFBT may improve the VOC in fullerene/non-fullerene PSCs.19
The UV-vis absorption spectra of the polymers in o-dichlorobenzene solution and in thin films are shown in Fig. 3a and b, respectively, and the corresponding absorption properties are summarized in Table 1. The polymers PBDTαNPFBT and PBDTβNPFBT display relatively similar hump-shaped absorption profiles with two peaks. The absorption edge (λonset) and maximum absorption peak (λmax) of PBDTβNPFBT in the film are largely red-shifted by 37 and 51 nm, respectively, compared to those of PBDTαNPFBT. The Eoptg values of PBDTαNPFBT and PBDTβNPFBT are estimated to be 1.79 and 1.70 eV according to Eoptg = 1240/λ, respectively. In addition, PBDTαNPFBT exhibits an obvious red-shift (∼25 nm) in the absorption onset from solution to thin film, but PBDTβNPFBT does not, which we attributed to the more coplanar structure and stronger intermolecular π–π interaction, resulting in the intensive aggregation of PBDTαNPFBT even in solution. The results were consistent with the DFT calculations and GIWAXS measurements. From the UV-vis absorption experiments, PBDTβNPFBT shows a broader absorption and a narrower Eoptg than the polymer PBDTDTffBT-H15 (Eoptg = 1.76 eV) we reported previously. At the same time, the absorption coefficients of PBDTβNPFBT in solution and in the thin film are much higher than those of PBDTαNPFBT, which leads to a better utilization of sunlight and a larger JSC. The above results clearly demonstrate that naphthalene bonded via the β-position can cause red-shifting and broadening of the absorption spectra efficiently by increasing the degree of π-conjugation at the appropriate intermolecular π–π stacking distance (d010), which may lead to more photons being captured, improving the JSC in fullerene/non-fullerene PSCs.

The redox behaviour of the two polymers was investigated using electrochemical cyclic voltammetry (CV).27 The CV curves are shown in Fig. 3c and the electrochemical properties are listed in Table 1. The HOMO energy levels and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of the two polymers were calculated according to the empirical formulas.27 As we know, energy level matching of donor and acceptor materials is an important factor to enhance the properties of PSCs, especially the VOC. It can be seen that the LUMO energy levels of PBDTαNPFBT and PBDTβNPFBT are located at −3.57 and −3.59 eV and are higher-lying than those of PC71BM (−4.3 eV) and ITIC (−3.83 eV),6,28 which can lead to an energy cascade favourable for electron transfer. The HOMO energy levels of PBDTαNPFBT and PBDTβNPFBT were calculated to be −5.37 and −5.31 eV, respectively. The low HOMO energy levels are ascribed to the introduction of the naphthalene rings with relatively low electron densities, which can ensure the essential stability and a high VOC in fullerene/non-fullerene PSCs.
The photovoltaic properties of the polymers were investigated, using a conventional device configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC71BM (ITIC)/Ca/Al. The devices were optimized for different conditions (D/A weight ratios, additive) as shown in Fig. S2 and Table S1 (ESI†). Table 2 summarizes the data of the optimized devices under an illumination of AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2. The PCE values for the 15 optimized devices and current density versus voltage (J–V) curves are shown in Fig. 4 and 5a, respectively. In the fullerene (PC71BM) system, the PBDTαNPFBT-based device without any additive exhibits a PCE of 3.75% with a VOC of 1.02 V, JSC of 8.52 mA cm−2, and FF of 0.432. The obvious high VOC arises from the low HOMO energy level and weak intermolecular interactions. When 3% 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) additive was used to optimize the morphology, the device performance was improved tremendously and it demonstrated a decent PCE of 8.02% with a VOC of 0.91 V, JSC of 12.61 mA cm−2, and FF of 0.699. For the isomer polymer PBDTβNPFBT, the DIO additive did not work. Even without any device treatment, the device shows a significantly high PCE of 9.80% with a decent VOC of 0.89 V, desirable JSC of 15.53 mA cm−2, and FF of 0.709. In contrast to PBDTαNPFBT, PBDTβNPFBT exhibits a much higher JSC value due to the broader absorption and narrower Eoptg. Likewise, the JSC value is also higher than that of PBDTDTffBT-H15 (14.92 mA cm−2) with the bare phenyl side chain we reported previously, due to the same reason. In addition, it was noted that PBDTβNPFBT exhibits a slightly higher VOC (0.89 V) than PBDTDTffBT-H (0.88 V), although the latter possesses a slightly lower HOMO level (−5.34 eV). The reason behind this phenomenon could be due to another key factor which can influence the VOC of PSCs: the saturation dark current density (JS).19 Thompson et al. studied the relationship between intermolecular π-interactions, JS and VOC in detail. They demonstrated that weak intermolecular interactions could lead to low JS, and hence, a correspondingly high VOC. To confirm this point and analyse the phenomenon, we investigated the JS of three PSCs (PBDTαNPFBT, PBDTβNPFBT and PBDTDTffBT-H) with a conventional configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC71BM/Ca/Al in the dark under the optimal process conditions. As shown in Fig. 5b, the JS values decreased along with an increase in the intermolecular π–π distance of PBDTDTffBT-H (3.64 Å), PBDTβNPFBT (3.75 Å) and PBDTαNPFBT, and correspondingly, the Voc values increased, which agreed well with the report from Thompson's group. Thus, it was reasonable that PBDTβNPFBT showed a slightly higher VOC than PBDTDTffBT-H. The PBDTβNPFBT-based device clearly demonstrates two advantages: a high JSC resulting from the broad absorption and narrow Eoptg, and a high VOC due to the low JS arising from the increase in the π–π distance. The results indicate that our design strategy by introducing naphthyl units as side chains is efficient in improving photovoltaic performance. As a result, the PCE (9.80%) of the PBDTβNPFBT-based device is at the top of those for fullerene-based PSCs reported in the literature. Meanwhile, for the non-fullerene (ITIC) system, the device based on PBDTβNPFBT exhibits a PCE of 7.33% with a VOC of 0.90 V, a JSC of 14.67 mA cm−2, and a FF of 0.555, which is higher than the PCE of the PBDTαNPFBT-based device. The results demonstrate that the asymmetric BDT with the naphthalene substituent bonded via the β-position is well suited for application to both fullerene and non-fullerene PCE devices, and there is still room to further increase the photovoltaic performance through constructing donor polymers with more appropriate acceptor units, such as fluorine substituted benzotriazole (FTAZ)8 and benzodithiophene-4,8-dione (BDD).29

The photoresponse of the solar cells was investigated by measuring the external quantum efficiency (EQE), and the EQE curves of the optimal devices are illustrated in Fig. 5c. The two polymers exhibit a broad photoresponse from 340 to 720 nm in the PC71BM system, and show a broader response of up to 780 nm in the ITIC system. The EQE value of PBDTβNPFBT/PC71BM is very high in the whole spectrum and the maximum value reaches 82%, indicating that the device exhibits a much better photoresponse over the absorption range than PBDTαNPFBT. In addition, it was noted that the EQE of PBDTαNPFBT/ITIC is much smaller than that of PBDTβNPFBT/ITIC, being between about 500 and 600 nm. As we know, the main absorption of an ITIC thin film is between about 600 and 750 nm.6 Thus, the EQE values of the two blended films between about 500 and 600 nm depend on the absorption properties of two polymers. Therefore, PBDTβNPFBT, with the higher absorption coefficient (Fig. 3a and b), shows a much better EQE value. The integrated current densities from the EQE curves are 12.31 and 9.95 mA cm−2 for PBDTαNPFBT in the PC71BM and ITIC systems, respectively, while those for PBDTβNPFBT are 15.31 and 14.43 mA cm−2, respectively, consistent with the JSC obtained from the J–V measurements.
Charge carrier mobility is another crucial factor for achieving high-efficiency devices. The hole mobilities of these two polymers were measured via the space charge limited current (SCLC) method,30 using the device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC71BM (ITIC)/Au. As shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†), the hole mobilities were calculated to be 1.88 × 10−4 and 7.31 × 10−5 for the optimized PBDTαNPFBT device in the PC71BM and ITIC systems, respectively, while those for the optimized PBDTβNPFBT device were found to be 4.56 × 10−4 and 2.82 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. These SCLC results are roughly consistent with the PCE data of the polymers, where a higher μhole is beneficial for obtaining a higher JSC and FF.31
Furthermore, the morphology and phase separation characteristics were explored using atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The AFM height and phase, and TEM images of the blends are shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†) and 6, respectively. It can be seen that the PBDTβNPFBT blend film exhibits a smoother and more uniform surface with lower root-mean-square (RMS) roughness (Fig. S4†). As shown in the TEM images (Fig. 6a and b), the PBDTβNPFBT/PC71BM blend shows clear fibril-like polymer aggregations when compared with the PBDTαNPFBT/PC71BM blend, which is greatly beneficial for exciton diffusion to the D/A interface and charge transfer.32 As a result, the PBDTβNPFBT-based device shows a much higher JSC. Interestingly, after adding 3% DIO, the morphology of the PBDTαNPFBT/PC71BM blend demonstrates a dramatic change towards well-defined phase separation with a better bicontinuous interpenetrating network (Fig. 6c), which is beneficial for charge transfer and leads to a great improvement in JSC and FF (Table S1†).33–35 However, for the PBDTβNPFBT/PC71BM blend with the DIO additive (Fig. 6d), the fibril-like polymer aggregations are broken and large domains of PC71BM are present, which would diminish exciton migration to the donor/acceptor interface, unfavourable for charge separation. As a result, the JSC and FF values are decreased. For the ITIC system, in contrast to the PBDTαNPFBT/ITIC blend, the PBDTβNPFBT/ITIC blend also shows better phase separation, which is consistent with the results for the JSC and FF. The significant difference in morphology between the two polymers is closely related to their aggregation behaviours, arising from the different molecular geometries due to substitution at different sites of the naphthyl group. The excellent morphology and phase separation should be another important reason why the polymer PBDTβNPFBT can obtain a higher PCE.

The microstructures of the blend films were further characterized using the GIWAXS method. As shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†), the out-of-plane and in-plane GIWAXS profiles of all blend films exhibit weak lamellar stacking (100) peaks. Interestingly, it was noted that PBDTβNPFBT/PC71BM blends without the DIO additive also display a diffraction peak of the (200) plane. The presence of higher order reflections implies the evolution of a long-range ordered structure.36 With the DIO added, the distances of the lamellar stacking (d100) for the two blends show a sharp increase, and thus offer a larger space to PC71BM, which may increase the D/A interface areas. This may be one reason why the VOC values decrease with the addition of DIO.37 In addition, the (010) peaks appear in the out-of-plane direction for the PBDTβNPFBT/ITIC blend films, indicating the existence of some face-on orientations. Finally, PBDTβNPFBT/ITIC achieved a much higher PCE than PBDTαNPFBT/ITIC. Overall, the GIWAXS results agree well with the morphologies of the blend films in the TEM images and support the device performance results.
Conclusions
In summary, asymmetric BDT-based donor polymers with naphthalene substituents bonded via the α- and β-positions were designed and synthesized. The effects of different extended orientations of conjugation degree and intermolecular π–π interactions on Eoptg and VOC were systematically investigated in fullerene and non-fullerene PSCs. Naphthyl units bonded via the β-position can lead to a better trade-off between the optical band gap and VOC and obtain a higher PCE. Employing the symmetry-breaking BDT as a building block can ensure an essential short π–π distance. In the desirable asymmetric BDTs system, PBDTβNPFBT containing naphthalene substituents bonded via the β-position can efficiently achieve a broad absorption and narrow Eoptg, by extending the degree of π-conjugation, which is beneficial for capturing more photons and ultimately improving the JSC. Furthermore, the PBDTβNPFBT-based devices exhibited quite a high VOC, which was ascribed to the low JS arising from the increase in the π–π distance. Additionally, it was noted that the PCE of 9.80% for the fullerene PSC based on PBDTβNPFBT is the highest efficiency among all reported BDT and DTBT backbone photovoltaic polymers. In addition, the PCE of 7.33% obtained for PBDTβNPFBT/ITIC without any treatment is also impressive for a non-fullerene PSC. Thus, this work further confirms the effectiveness and advantages of the symmetry-breaking strategy, and meanwhile reveals a new naphthalene substituent, which has the potential to obtain higher photovoltaic performance, and can be applied to other D–A light-harvesting polymers to achieve excellent performance in fullerene and non-fullerence PSCs.
