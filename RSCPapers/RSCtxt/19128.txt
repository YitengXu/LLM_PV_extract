    , Accepted 22nd June 2018First published on 22nd June 2018AbstractUsing earth abundant transition metal-based compounds to replace noble metal catalysts towards hydrogen evolution from water splitting seems to have great importance worldwide. Compositional modulation and structural design on nanoscale have been hot topics for the optimization of their catalytic properties and have attracted great research interest. In this study, we report Co/CoN Janus nanoparticles embedded in a porous nitrogen doped carbon (Co/CoN–NC) composite catalyst, derived by the heat treatment of a Co2+ containing polymer in ammonia atmosphere. The as-obtained hybrid catalyst showed excellent electrocatalytic activities for the hydrogen evolution reaction in both acidic and basic media, and it delivered a current density of 10 mA cm−2 at the overpotential of 160 mV in 1 M KOH and 190 mV in 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte. In addition, the catalyst could sustain potentiostatic electrolysis for at least 100 hours at 10 mA cm−2 in both acidic and alkaline solutions. Mechanistic study suggested that the high activity of the composite electrocatalyst originated from the Janus effects between Co and CoN, which enhanced the electron transfer efficiency and led to fast hydrogen adsorption and desorption kinetics.
Introduction
In response to the on-going energy over-consumption and the climate change currently caused by population explosion and excessive emissions of greenhouse gases, the pursuit of clean energy has become crucial.1–8 Hydrogen production from the electrolysis of water by using intermittent energy as the driving force seems to be an appealing approach to prevent the release of pollutants or greenhouse gases during the reaction.9,10 Searching for highly efficient and low-cost catalysts to replace the state-of-art noble metal catalysts, such as Pt and Ir based composites, have attracted scientific attention to make the process feasible.11,12 As alternatives, transition metal cobalt based compounds have emerged as the most studied class due to their unfilled 3d orbitals, variable valence, and inherent activity for the HER, and thus has inspired high hopes.13,14 To date, a large range of Co-based composites (CoO, CoS2, CoP, CoSe, and Co) and architectures (nanospheres, nanoplates, and nanowires) have been reported to be promising non-noble catalyst alternatives towards water splitting.15,16 Co-Based materials have often encountered problems due to their low-conductivity and particles' tendency to agglomerate during the reaction. Hence, at this juncture, carbon-coating has become an appealing strategy to improve the activity and the stability of these catalysts since it can increase the electronic conductivity of the composite, boost the tolerance towards extreme testing conditions and protect Co species from agglomeration or leaching.17,18 Therefore, the preparation of uniformly dispersed Co/C still remains a challenge due to the limitations of synthesis methods. Coupling carbon with transition metal composites has been proved to be an effective method to create a synergetic effect. Furthermore, the construction of heterogeneous structures based on different species with specific interfaces to facilitate the electron and mass transfer at the interface is also a smart approach.19–23 For example, Li et al. reported Co/CoP Janus nanoparticles as Mott–Schottky electrocatalysts, which exhibited excellent electrochemical water splitting performance due to the rectifying effect occurring on the metal–semiconductor interface.19 Recently, the group prepared a CoSe/Ti dyadic electrode to function as an excellent oxygen evolution reaction catalyst by constructing an ohmic contact at the interface of the cobalt selenide nanostructures.20 The heart of these efforts to improve the catalytic performance lies in the modification of surface electronic properties, such as negative charge density, d-band center and electronic polarization by engineering the arrangement and composition of surface atoms. From this point of view, the design and synthesis of new-types of composites to achieve drastic improvements in electrochemical water splitting properties require more efforts.
Motivated by this, in this study, we developed Co/CoN Janus nanoparticles embedded in porous carbon to demonstrate the phenomenon through a facile polymerization–nitridation approach. The method involved the synthesis of the Co-containing polymer with ethylenediamine carbon tetrachloride as the starting material and annealing under an NH3 flow at 800 °C, realizing the partial transformation of Co to CoN and the doping of nitrogen into carbon, simultaneously. Finally, the Co/CoN hybrids embedded in porous carbon supports were obtained, as illustrated in Fig. 1. Co/CoN nanoparticles were uniformly confined in the carbon matrix and could have an intimate contact with the nitrogen-rich carbon layer, hence combining their respective merits. Compared to individual Co nanoparticles wrapped in the carbon matrix, the Co/CoN hybrid electrocatalyst showed superior catalytic activity and stability for the HER under both acidic and basic environments. Several merits possessed by our electrocatalysts were beneficial to the remarkable performance. First, the local contact potential difference at the interface of Co and CoN can redistribute the electrons around the components by the rectifying effect and thus facilitate the conversion process of H+ to hydrogen. Furthermore, the porous carbon support, providing high surface area, allows for active sites' exposure, efficient ion transfer and sufficient contact with the electrolyte and also protects the nanoparticles from being leached off.

Experimental
Chemicals and reagents
Ethylenediamine and cobaltous nitrate hexahydrate were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. Carbon tetrachloride was purchased from Tianjin Tiantai Fine Chemical Co., Ltd. Sulphuric acid (H2SO4) and potassium hydroxide (KOH) were purchased from Beijing Chemical Factory. Commercially available platinum on activated carbon (20 wt% Pt/C) and Nafion (5 wt%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. All chemicals were used without further purification. Highly purified water (18.2 MΩ cm resistivity) was provided by a PALL PURELAB Plus system.
Synthesis of Co/CoN–NC
Cobaltous nitrate hexahydrate (0.183 g) was dispersed in ethylenediamine (1.35 g) by ultrasonication and stirred for at least 20 min to form a homogeneous slurry. Then, 2.31 g of carbon tetrachloride was added, and the resultant mixture was refluxed and stirred using an oil bath at 90 °C for 6 h. After cooling to room temperature naturally, the obtained dark brown colored product was transferred to a quartz boat, followed by the heat-treatment of the polymer composites in ammonia flow at 800 °C with a heating rate of 3.0 °C min−1 for 3 h to carbonize the polymer. The Co–NC sample was prepared by a similar procedure, but only by calcining in nitrogen environment.
General characterizations
The powder samples were examined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) (Rigaku, D/Max 2550, Japan) with a Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å) at a scanning speed of 5° min−1 over a 2θ range of 10–80°. XPS was performed using an ESCALAB 250 X-ray photoelectron spectrometer with a monochromatic X-ray source (Al Kα hν = 1486.6 eV). The energy scale of the spectrometer was calibrated using the peak positions corresponding to Au 4f7/2, Cu 2p3/2, and Ag 3d5/2. The standard deviation for the binding energy (BE) values was 0.1 eV. The scanning electron microscope (SEM) images were obtained with a field-emission scanning electron microscope (JEOL JSM 6700F). The high resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and elemental mapping images were obtained with a Philips-FEI Tecnai G2S-Twin microscope equipped with a field emission gun operating at 200 kV. N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms were obtained via Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) measurements by using a Quanta 4200e surface area analyzer. The pore size distribution was derived from the adsorption curve using the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method. Raman spectra were obtained with a Renishaw Raman system model 1000 spectrometer with a 20 mW air-cooled argon ion laser (514.5 nm) as the exciting source. The laser power at the sample position was typically 400 μW with an average spot size of 1 μm in diameter.
Computational details
The generalized gradient approximation (GGA) with the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof24 exchange–correlation function and a 600 eV cut-off for the plane-wave basis set were employed to perform all the density functional theory (DFT) computations of the materials within the frame of Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP).25 The projector-augmented plane wave (PAW)26 was used to describe the electron–ion interactions. The dense Monkhorst–Pack grid k-points were employed for the geometric optimization of Co–NC and Co/CoN–NC, respectively. Furthermore, the density of states (DOS) of correlative systems was computed by using a normal PBE functional. For all the calculations, the convergence threshold was set as 10−5 eV and 0.01 eV Å−1.
HER measurements
All the electrochemical measurements were conducted in a typical three electrode setup using a CHI Instrument (Model 660E). Specific test procedures were similar to that reported in our previous reports.27 In the acidic environment (0.5 M H2SO4), a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) and a carbon rod were employed as the reference and counter electrodes, respectively. In the alkaline environment (1 M KOH), a Hg/HgO electrode in a 1 M NaOH solution and a carbon rod were employed as the reference and counter electrodes, respectively. In all the measurements, the potential was measured against the SCE reference electrode or the Hg/HgO reference electrode, which were calibrated with respect to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). For preparing the working electrodes, the ink of the powdered catalyst (e.g., 20% Pt/C Co–NC, and Co/CoN–NC) was prepared by dispersing 5 mg of the catalyst into 3 mL of the ethanol solvent through sonication to form a homogeneous slurry. Then, 9 μL of the catalyst ink was loaded onto a glass-carbon electrode (GCE) of 3 mm in diameter, giving a mass loading of ∼0.21 mg cm−2. After drying naturally at room temperature, the film was protected by 3 μL of 0.3% Nafion solution in isopropanol. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) measurements were conducted in 0.5 M H2SO4 or 1 M KOH electrolyte at a scan rate of 1 mV s−1. To obtain the correlations between the current density and the applied potential as well as the Tafel plots, the steady-state current density as a function of voltage was measured with a dwell time of 5 min. Durability test was carried out by monitoring the current density for 100 hours at fixed overpotentials. Comparison of the catalytic activity amongst different materials is expressed mainly based on the overpotential obtained for the reaction at a constant current density. A multi-step chronoamperometric curve was obtained in case of Co/CoN–NC, with measurements obtained at different overpotentials starting at 50 mV and ending at 550 mV, with an increment of 50 mV at every 500 s in 1 M KOH solution.
Results and discussion
The partial transformation of Co to CoN was first confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), as presented in Fig. 2A. The XRD patterns of the obtained samples calcined in N2 could be well indexed to elemental Co with the diffraction peaks centred at 44.2°, 51.5° and 75.8° (JCPDS No. 15-0806). The characteristic diffraction peaks appeared at 36.2°, 42.2°, 61.3°, 73.3° and 76.8° following the pyrolysis in the NH3 atmosphere, are attributed to the cubic CoN phase (JCPDS No. 16-0116), and the peaks of metallic Co become weaker simultaneously, indicating the coexistence of CoN and Co in the final products. At the same time, the graphitized carbon peaks at 26.2° were weakened after the nitridation, implying that the introduction of nitrogen atoms destroyed the ordering of carbon in the heterostructures.28,29 To investigate the influence of nitridation temperature on crystallinity and structure, calcination in the ammonia environment was conducted at various temperatures. When the pyrolysis temperature was decreased to 700 °C, only Co wrapped in the carbon layer was obtained, whereas when the temperature was increased to 900 °C, the crystallinity increased, and the particles apparently agglomerated in the size range from about 50 nm to 120 nm. Thus, 800 °C was selected as the optimum temperature and the following discussions would mainly focus on the sample obtained at this temperature. The morphology, structure, and size distribution of the resultant products were further characterized with transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). Carbonization of the Co-containing polymer precursor at 800 °C yielded highly dispersed cobalt nanoparticles with a size range of 20–100 nm in the porous protective carbon layer (Fig. 2B). By treating in ammonia atmosphere, we obtained Co nanoparticles decorated with CoN nanoparticles without significant size variations. At the same time, the CoN/Co nanoparticles became irregular in shape and rough in surface, as displayed in Fig. 2C. It can be observed in the magnified TEM image in Fig. 2D that the carbon sheet was covered with meso- and micro-pores, which was in accordance with our previous report.30 The porous network structure originated from a so called molten salt activation process. In detail, when a certain amount of Co(NO3)2 was introduced into the polymer precursor, the metal nitrate melted into clusters at an elevated temperature and acted as template of organic–inorganic salt melts phase separation which happened during the continuous polymer decomposition, finally leaving carbon with pores. The lattice fringes of 0.207 nm and 0.482 nm revealed by HRTEM in Fig. 2E were consistent with the (111) lattice plane of elemental Co and the (111) lattice plane of cubic CoN, confirming the coexistence of metallic Co and CoN phases in the Janus-type nanostructure. Furthermore, there exists a clear interface between the two phases, and more TEM images to support this fact are shown in Fig. S2.† The corresponding EDX elemental mapping images in Fig. 2F show cobalt-containing nanoparticles randomly dispersed throughout the N doped carbon matrix. In addition, the intensity of N was found to be much weaker than the intensities of other elements. This can be interpreted by the fact that the N content was really low in the composite. In fact, the content of N was measured to be 22.59 wt% and 4.70 wt% before and after nitridation using NH3, respectively. The large loss of nitrogen after the high-temperature calcination may originate from the volatilization of nitrogen oxide and the hydronitrogenation during the polymer decomposition.

The porous structure of the material was further confirmed by the nitrogen adsorption–desorption experiments at 77 K, as shown in Fig. 3A. Both Co–NC and Co/CoN–NC samples presented type IV isotherm characteristics with an adsorption hysteresis, indicating that there are numerous mesopores existing in the materials. Also, they all showed an increase in adsorption at a low relative pressure (p/p0 < 0.2), suggesting the existence of micropores at the same time. The specific surface area of Co/CoN–NC was approximately 251 m2 g−1, which was close to that of Co–NC (264 m2 g−1). The corresponding pore size distribution plots in the inset of Fig. 3A were calculated from the adsorption branch of the nitrogen adsorption isotherm with the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method, further revealing the absence of abundant mesoporous (∼4.8 nm) in Co/CoN–NC, which was beneficial to the liquid electrolyte penetration, exposure of active sites and mass transfer. The above results showed that there was no distinct change in the form of carbon before and after the treatment with ammonia, implying that the ammonia treatment had negligible influence on the porous structure, crystallinity and textural properties of the hybrid.

Accordingly, the Raman spectrum also provided similar evidence on the effect of the introduced nitrogen on carbon. As shown in Fig. 3B, the peaks located at roughly 1330 and 1580 cm−1 in the Raman spectra of Co–NC and Co/CoN–NC, are the typical D band and the G band, respectively.31,32 It has been well addressed that the D band is closely related to sp3-hybridized carbon, structural defects, amorphous carbon or edges that can break the symmetry and the G band is associated with the vibrations of all sp2 carbon atoms in a two-dimensional hexagonal lattice. ID/IG increases from 0.98 to 1.1 after NH3 treatment, which may have been probably caused by the generation of more structural defects by annealing under NH3, which in turn would improve the electrocatalytic HER activity.33,34 In addition, the content of Co, C and N elements was calculated to be 13.14 (wt%), 76.31 (wt%) and 4.70 (wt%), respectively, for Co/CoN–NC and 10.06 (wt%), 74.37 (wt%) and 1.25 (wt%), respectively, for Co–NC based on thermogravimetric analysis (Fig. S3†) together with CHN analysis, as summarized in Table S1.† These results revealed that the nitridation rendered a twofold increase in the N content.
In addition, we further conducted X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis to investigate the surface chemistry of both samples. The structures of the carbon supports did not change much by the nitridation process, as revealed by the similarities of C 1s (Fig. S4†) and N 1s (Fig. 3C) XPS spectra of Co–NC and Co/CoN–NC samples. The high-resolution XPS spectrum of the N 1s peak demonstrates pyridinic N (398.2 eV), Co–N (399 eV), pyrrolic N (400.9 eV) and graphitic N (402.2 eV) species in Co–NC and Co/CoN–NC.35,36 The N 1s XPS spectra of Co–NC implied that the nitrogen atom was not only doped in the carbon layer but also bonded with the surface atoms of metallic Co. Furthermore, the peak areas of the Co–N bond in Co–NC and Co/CoN–NC samples were similar, indicating that nitridation enhanced the amounts of C–N and Co–N bonds simultaneously. In Co 2p spectra of Co–NC and Co/CoN–NC, the peak located at 779.2 eV was attributed to zero-valence state Co and the peaks at 780.1 eV and 781.7 eV were attributed to the ionic state cobalt (i.e., Co2+ and Co3+). The zero-valence state Co decreased substantially after nitridation, which indicated that the annealing of the Co-containing polymer precursor in the ammonia airflow promoted the transformation of metallic Co to CoN.37–39 As for Co–NC, cobalt in the oxidative state accounted for a large proportion, and the existence of Co2+ and Co3+ was mainly due to the existence of Co–N bonds and the oxidation caused by the ambient environment around the Co nanoparticle surface.
Electrochemical measurements
Sustained hydrogen production from the electrochemical splitting of water is undoubtedly highly desired because it is the key point in various renewable energy technologies, including fuel cells and metal–air batteries.9,10 The as-synthesized hybrid possesses Co/CoN nanocrystals evenly dispersed in the carbon support, a hierarchical porous architecture, satisfactory BET surface area, as well as high conductivity. Co/CoN–NC was considered suitable for electrochemical HER processes. Many water-splitting devices are designed to work in acidic environments to be compatible with proton exchange membrane-based electrolysis units; from this perspective, acid-stable non-precious electrocatalysts with high catalytic efficiency are highly desired.12,21 The tests were first performed in acidic medium (0.5 M H2SO4), using a typical three-electrode system by employing a calomel electrode and a carbon rod as the reference and auxiliary electrodes, respectively (see Experimental section for details). All the potentials we measured in this study were converted into the potentials versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). Co–NC and commercially available Pt/C (20 wt%) were also analyzed under the same conditions for comparison. Co–NC, Co/CoN–NC and Pt/C (20 wt%) all exhibited certain hydrogen evolution electrocatalytic activities, and Pt/C (20 wt%) gave the best catalytic activity as expected. Specifically, the overpotentials needed to drive a current density of 10 mA cm−2 for Co–NC, Co/CoN–NC and Pt/C (20 wt%) were 340 mV 190 mV and 90 mV, respectively. Thus, coupling CoN in the material could lower the catalyst's overpotential by 150 mV. These results implied that the modification of CoN on Co–NC led to a significantly enhanced electrocatalytic activity for HER. Tafel plots were considered to evaluate the HER mechanism and to provide a hint to elucidate the electron-transfer kinetics on the catalyst's surface during the hydrogen evolution process. The linear portions were well fitted to the Tafel equation: η = a + blogj, (where η is the overpotential, j is the current density and b is the Tafel slope). It is well accepted that there are three principle steps for the hydrogen evolution during HER in acidic medium.40–42 The first step is the Volmer reaction, which is the formation of adsorbed hydrogen atoms (Hads) on the catalyst's surface to form adsorbed hydrogen (Hads): H+ + e− → Hads(1)followed by either the discharge step, viz., the Heyrovsky reaction, H+ + e− + Hads → H2(2)or the recombination step, viz., the Tafel reaction, or a combination of the two 2Hads → H2(3)
As shown in Fig. 4B, Pt/C delivered a Tafel slope of about 29 mV dec−1, which was consistent with the previously reported value.43,44 Co/CoN–NC and Co/–NC gave Tafel slopes of 65 mV dec−1 and 121 mV dec−1, indicating that they led to Volmer–Heyrovsky and Volmer mechanisms on the catalyst surfaces, respectively.45–47

Apart from working well as a robust electrocatalyst in acidic media, Co/CoN–NC was found to be an active and stable electrocatalyst in the basic medium. With 1 M KOH as the electrolyte and a Hg/HgO electrode and a Pt wire as the reference and auxiliary electrodes, respectively, a typical three-electrode system was assembled. Co–NC and Pt/C (20 wt%) were also included for comparison. As shown in the polarization curves in Fig. 4C, Pt/C shows the highest catalytic activity, giving a current density of 10 mA cm−2 (the current density expected for a 10% efficient solar water-splitting device) at an overpotential of ∼25 mV. Co/CoN–NC also exhibits remarkable catalytic activity toward HER, with an overpotential of 150 mV to produce a current density of 10 mA cm−2; this was much lower than that of Co–NC, which needs about 300 mV to give the same current density. Overall, these results suggested that the hybrid nanoparticles showed superior activity compared to individual Co nanoparticles and nitridation was an effective strategy to enhance the catalytic performance. Also, the activity improvement was mainly caused by the formation of heterojunctions. The superiority of Co/CoN–NC for the electrocatalysis of the HER as compared with Co–NC was also supported by the fact that the former had a smaller Tafel slope than the latter, as displayed in Fig. 4D, suggesting favorable reaction kinetics on the Co/CoN–NC catalyst surface.
Stability is another important criterion to evaluate a catalyst. Fig. 5A shows the steady-state current density of the catalyst as a function of the applied voltage over long reaction times at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 using a potentiostatic method in acidic and alkaline electrolytes. It can be observed that Co/CoN–NC can retain its catalytic activity for at least 100 hours with minor fluctuations in alkaline medium. Moreover in acidic medium, it exhibits robust stability for long term electrolysis and it could drive a current density of 10 mA cm−2 at an overpotential of 190 mV for 100 hours with slight degradation. The faint decay in activity mainly occurred in the first 30 hours during the measurements, which was probably caused by the partial dissolution of metal nanoparticles that were not completely coated by the carbon layer. Moreover, the LSV curve after 1000 continuous cycles in the scanning window of 0 to −0.4 V at a scan rate of 1 mV s−1 was almost the same as that obtained in the initial cycle (Fig. 5B), confirming that Co/CoN–NC is a highly stable and efficient catalyst for HER. In addition, the multi-step chronoamperometric test indicated that Co/CoN–NC has high stability with good rate performance as the applied overpotential increased from 0 to 550 mV with an increment of 50 mV at every 500 s during the electrocatalysis process, as revealed in Fig. 5C. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) investigation of the catalysts was carried out to study the kinetics occurring at the electrode/electrolyte surface during the HER process. It is well accepted that the high-frequency region of a Nyquist plot represents the charge transfer in the catalyst layer and the low frequency region is related to the mass transport processes. The Nyquist plots in Fig. 5F show that Co/CoN–NC has a smaller semicircular diameter in comparison to that of Co–NC, revealing its smaller contact impedance and faster charge transport.48,49

To the best of our knowledge, the heterostructured Co/CoN–NC ranks among the best transition metal nitride materials reported till date, regarding the electrochemical catalytic activity in both acidic and basic media (Table S1†). Furthermore, DFT calculations were conducted to fundamentally understand the relationship between the Co/CoN heterojunctions and the enhanced electrochemical catalytic activity. Co is well known to be metallic, while CoN is also metallic, as revealed by the band structure shown in Fig. 6A.50 Contact potential difference would appear at the heterointerface of the two-metallic phases (Fig. 6B) and it could change the carrier concentration and thus influence the surface's H+ adsorption ability.51–53 The work functions of pure Co and CoN were calculated to be 4.4 eV and 5.5 eV, respectively, indicating that the introduction of nitrogen atom decreased the Fermi level position. Therefore, once the heterojunctions were formed, surface electrons transferred from Co to CoN, until the Fermi level equilibrium between Co and CoN was reached. Compared to pure Co, Co active sites in Co/CoN are more preferable to trap electrons and adsorb hydrogen due to the lower Fermi level. For the hydrogen evolution reaction (2H+ + 2e → H2), the increase in hydrogen adsorption capability on the catalyst surface surely improves the reaction activity. However, too high content of CoN in the composite is disadvantageous for improving catalytic activity. Previous reports have demonstrated that the catalytic performance of pure transition metal nitride is not ideal (Table S2†). This fact can be interpreted as follows. The N centers in a nitride are simple spectators in catalytic reactions (ensemble effect) and thus, excess nitrogen would lead to deactivation caused by the decreasing in the exposure of active Co sites.54 In other words, Co/CoN heterojunctions, prepared in this study, not only enhanced the hydrogen adsorption ability, but also fully exposed the active sites, resulting in optimized electrochemical properties.

(B) Electronic structures of metallic Co, CoN before contact and the Co/CoN based contact potential difference (EF, Evac and ϕ denote Fermi level energy, vacuum level and work function, respectively). 
Furthermore, the porous carbon shell not only protected Co-based active materials from being leached off, but also boosted the conductivity. The strong interactions between Co/CoN nanoparticles and highly conductive N-doped carbon supports led to a synergistic effect for the enhancement of electrochemical performance. The existence of nanostructured pores enabled sufficient contact between the active material and the electrolyte, thoroughly exposed the active sites, shortened the ion diffusion distance and enhanced the electrochemical kinetics.
Conclusions
In summary, we have developed a facile polymerization–nitridation synthetic method to construct a hierarchically structured porous 3D Co/CoN–NC Janus hybrid. As a result of the contact potential difference of the metallic components and the porous structure, the obtained Co/CoN–NC nanocomposite exhibited excellent HER performance in both acidic and alkaline environments with outstanding durability and stability for at least 100 hours. The superior catalytic performance of CoN decorated Co nanoparticles in the carbon layer (i.e. Co/CoN–NC nanocomposite) may be attributed to their unique structural and compositional features. Specifically, the heterointerface between Co and CoN with different work functions may cause the substantial increase in the electrochemical catalytic performance. At the same time, our study offers an effective strategy to develop an efficient non-noble-metal HER hybrid catalyst by controlling the contact interface of active species, thus tuning the catalytic property of the material. Also, the synthetic approach may provide guidance to design other transition metal-based composite structures for electrochemical applications.
