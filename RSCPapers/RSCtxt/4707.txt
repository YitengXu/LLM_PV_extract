    , Accepted 25th June 2021First published on 28th June 2021AbstractThe scientific surge in halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is due to their solution processability and high power conversion efficiency; however, the deficiency in the photo-induced charge transfer dynamics at the perovskite-charge transport layer interfaces due to depleted energy alignment and surface traps impedes performance improvement. Interface engineering has become one of the rewarding approaches to control the charge accumulation and recombination at interfaces, which in turn promotes excellent charge extractability and device performance. Here, we introduce a few-atom thick 1T-rich 2D-WS2 as an interfacial layer placed on a perovskite to minimize the energy barrier and charge accumulation at the interface to intensify the extraction of detrapped charges and charge transfer dynamics. By combining the interfacial layer in a dopant-free hole transport layer, we achieved a stabilized efficiency of over 19% with a significantly enhanced open-circuit voltage and fill factor. Our work put forward the deep experimental understanding of 2D materials as an interfacial agent toward their stabilized performances.
Introduction
Among the next-generation photovoltaic (PV) technologies, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) yielded an unparalleled power conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 25%, which is on par with those of mature technologies. The success of PSCs is plagued by their frail stability under long-term operational conditions, which derails the commercialization of this promising technology.1–5 In perovskite-based PVs, the synthetic pathways that include but are not limited to compositional engineering, temperature profile, and additive concentration largely influence the resulting PV performances and ultimately the device stability. Despite the astonishing compositional engineering that has been studied by many groups, challenges remain for achieving long-term stability that is further complicated by ionic migration, light irradiation, moisture corrosion of the PSCs.6,7
Beyond the active material, the energy band alignment of the perovskite layer at the interfaces with the charge selective layers is a prerequisite in governing the device performance and stability.4,8,9 Perovskites are sandwiched between charge selective layers with possibly associated energy and chemical incompatibilities with the contacting layers making the interfaces a crucial zone with high potential to instigate the device failure.4,6,10,11 Arguably, photo-generated charge separation and transfer to the corresponding interfaces from the light-absorbing layer could occur with the absence of energy losses without recombination at the interfaces. Moreover, the ideal electron/hole selective layers should allow their corresponding charges only, while having no recombination and transport losses at the interfaces.10,12,13 However, due to imbalanced charge separation and transfer, inferior interface band alignment, defects associated with the interfaces under real conditions can deteriorate the PV performances of PSCs.12,14–16 At the device level, stress due to extrinsic environmental conditions such as varying temperatures, electric fields, atmospheres, and light intensities intensively propagate the degradation mechanism.17,18 Furthermore, unbalanced charge injection, trapped charges, and capacitive current promote the charge accumulation at the interfaces between the perovskite and charge selective layers, and ultimately the trapped charged-driven degradation may take place in addition to the photo-generated hysteresis.19–21
Several approaches have been devoted toward the long term PV performance including the introduction of the interface energy alignment layer, tuning the work function of the perovskite layer, doping mechanism into charge transport layers, and self-assembled derivatives to overcome photo-generated carrier traps, improving the quality of the interfacial coupling, and defect passivation.4,8,9 However, the hygroscopic nature associated with doping or interfacial materials can further accelerate the degradation of the perovskite layer.22–24 The accession of the interfacial layer gave promising results in terms of PV performances and stability.25–29 The analogues of 2D materials termed as 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are a promising class of semiconductors for PV applications including PSCs due to their outstanding chemical, physical and electronic properties which can be further tuned by their synthesis route.7,29,30 However, the scalable synthesis of 2D-TMD materials with high purity and specific functionalities remains a key to advanced PV applications. Among the different synthetic protocols, Li+ intercalated liquid-phase exfoliation of layered materials is a promising approach that offers high yield, simplistic method, up-scalability, and cost-effectiveness. Reports dealing with 2D-TMDs such as MoS2 and WS2 in PSCs as an HTM showed moderate PCE values.31 Several groups have investigated the behaviour of 2D-MoS2 and WS2 as electron transport layers (ETMs) in PSCs.2,32,33 However, the PCE associated with 2D-TMDs as an individual HTM or ETM is not comparable towards the commercialization, stipulating the limitation of 2D-TMDs as individual charge transport layers. In contrast, the utilization of 2D-TMDs as an interfacial layer between the active and charge transport layers led to significantly improved PV performance with an extended lifetime.7,23,34–36 The non-covalent interactions and the dangling-bond-free nature of 2D-TMDs could aid in further stabilizing the active layer from hygroscopic additives in charge transport materials.29,35 Earlier, we have reported Li+ intercalated 2D-MoS2 as an interfacial layer in dopant-free n–i–p PSCs, achieving an upgraded PCE.
Herein, we report our findings on the successful implementation of Li+ intercalated liquid-phase exfoliated 2D-WS2 as an interfacial layer on a triple cation {Cs0.1FAPbI3(0.81)MAPbBr3(0.09)} perovskite (CsFAMA), leading to a significantly enhanced PCE and an extended lifetime. We noted that the 2D-WS2 as an interlayer could diminish the surface traps and interfacial charge recombination at the perovskite/HTM interface through the aligned energy level, subsequently boosting the PCE from 15.7% to 19.02% owing to the boosted open-circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF).
Result and discussion
We derived few layers of 1T predominant WS2 nanosheets in isopropanol (IPA) from bulk WS2 powder using rapid Li+ intercalation in combination with ultra-sonication and a series of ultracentrifugation steps. During the Li+ intercalation process into WS2, the lithiation intermediate (LixWS2) was thoroughly reacted with H2O to separate the van der Waals bonded layers and form few- or single-layer WS2 sheets. The microstructure of the synthesized 2D-WS2 nanosheets was analysed under a transmission electron microscope (TEM) and an atomic force microscope (AFM). Fig. 1a illustrates a representative TEM image of 2D-WS2 with a lateral size of ca. 120 nm. The topographic AFM image (Fig. 1b) together with the inset thickness profile suggests the thickness of the 2D-WS2 in the 5–6 nm range, affirming the existence of few-layer nanosheets. Fig. 1c shows the statistical distribution with the maximum population peaks at 5.15 nm. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of 2D-WS2 shows a high intense single diffraction peak at 2θ of 14.52°, corresponding to the (002) crystal plane of hexagonal WS2, and the absence of additional peaks from bulk WS2, confirming the highly oriented phase crystallinity of the synthesized 2D-WS2 nanosheets2 (Fig. S1, ESI†). The UV-Vis absorption of 2D-WS2 nanosheets dispersed in IPA solution (Fig. 1d) leads to the weak shoulder peaks located at 637 and 528 nm corresponding to the A and B excitonic transitions, confirming the formation of 1T rich 2D-WS2 nanosheets.37 The optical bandgap estimated from the Tauc plot is about 1.76 eV (inset of Fig. 1d).

The positions of core-level peaks corresponding to W4f7/2 and W4f5/2 originated from X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is an effective way to specify the phase and chemical state of the elements composing the 2D-WS2 nanosheets. We ascribed the emerged doublet (Fig. 1e) at 31.49 and 33.48 eV to the W4f7/2 and W4f5/2 core levels of the metallic 1T phase, respectively, attributing the presence of the predominant contribution of the 1T phase with 82.25% in the as-prepared 2D-WS2. However, the less intense additional peaks at 32.31 and 34.33 eV were also observed, showing the simultaneous existence of the partial semiconducting 2H phase in WS2 nanosheets.37 A similar phase contribution can be deduced from the high-resolution XPS spectra of S2p (Fig. 1f), in which two identical peaks relevant to S2p3/2 and S2p1/2 for the 1T phase emerged at 161.24 and 162.37 eV, respectively.
We examined the microstructure of the CsFAMA perovskite layer grown on the SnO2 QD layer using SEM and AFM analyses (Fig. S2, ESI†). Notably from AFM analysis, we deduce that the perovskite roughness decreases from 21.48 nm to 16.16 nm after the deposition of 2D-WS2 nanosheets on the perovskite. However, full coverage of the 2D-WS2 layer on the perovskite can only be achieved through multiple depositions of the solution of 2D-WS2 as previously reported, and in this report, we deposited 2D-WS2 nanosheets three times.
The XRD analysis (Fig. S3, ESI†) indicating the presence of 2D-WS2 does not influence the crystallinity of the perovskite. The interaction between 2D-WS2 nanosheets and the perovskite layer at the interface was further investigated using XPS characterization. As shown in Fig. 2a the Pb4f5/2 and Pb4f7/2 peaks of the bare perovskite layers are located at 142.98 and 138.1 eV, respectively, and these peaks show an apparent binding energy shift of 0.11 eV towards the higher binding region with the presence of 2D-WS2 layers. A similar binding energy shift can be deduced in I3d peaks when the perovskite layer is placed with 2D-WS2 in which the shift is around 0.15 eV (Fig. 2b), corroborating a possible strong interaction of S–Pb, S–I, and the modified chemical environment of the [PbI6]4− octahedra.34,38,39 No visible changes were noted in the UV-visible spectra of the perovskite with/without the 2D WS2 interface layer (Fig. S4, ESI†).

PSCs were fabricated based on the planar n–i–p configuration with stacked layers of FTO/bl-TiO2/SnO2-QDs/Cs0.1FAPbI3(0.81)MAPbBr3(0.09)/2D-WS2/PTAA/Au (Fig. 3a) to evaluate the PV performances by the placement of 2D-WS2 as an interfacial layer. The energy levels of the materials used in the device architecture including the as-prepared 2D-WS2 (Fig. 3b) suggest the compatibility of the valence band energy of the interface layer at the HTM/perovskite interface which overcomes the energy barrier for effective free hole extraction.6,40–43 The SnO2 layer together with thin compact-TiO2 acts as an electron selective contact to prevent direct contact to the bottom charge collector, annihilating a possible charge recombination path. We acquired the cross-sectional image of the fabricated PSC by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (Fig. S5, ESI†).

The photocurrent-density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of PSCs with and without the interface layer are illustrated (Fig. 3c), and the corresponding PV parameters are summarized in Table 1. A significant increase was measured from the PSCs incorporating 2D-WS2 as an interlayer, with a value of 19.02% PCE along with an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 1051 mV, a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 23.59 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 76.68%. Under similar conditions, the control devices showed a PCE of 15.74% with Voc, Jsc, and FF being 976.7 mV, 23.39 mA cm−2, and 68.88%, respectively. Notably, the PSCs with an interface layer show an average improvement of PCE by 23.5% from the control PSC owing to an improvement in the Voc and FF. The integrated Jsc values extracted from the external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurement are 22.97 and 22.28 mA cm−2 for the PSC with and without the interface layer, in agreement with the Jsc obtained from J–V curves (Fig. 3d). The corresponding integrated currents of the two PSCs show a slight reduction compared to the Jsc obtained from the J–V curve possibly due to the difference in the light source used, which is much lower in intensity than of the solar simulator system.29 Notably, we noted a significant reduction in the device hysteresis after introducing the interface layer (Fig. 4a). We attribute the enhanced Voc to the reduction of the high energy barrier between the valence band energy level of the perovskite (EV = −5.65 eV) and the HOMO level of PTAA (−5.1 eV) by placing the interface layer, and this facilitates a facial photo-generated charge transfer between the perovskite and PTAA layer.7,23 Moreover, the PSC fabricated with the 2D-WS2 interfacial layer shows a decreased interfacial series resistance (Rs) and a higher shunt resistance (Rsh), which suppress the interfacial charge losses through decreased charge recombination, to push the FF.

The influence of the 2D-WS2 interface layer on charge dynamics in the PSCs was analysed using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) under dark conditions. The Nyquist plot is shown with the equivalent circuit model (Fig. 4b, and Table S3, ESI†) that comprises single series resistance (Rs), charge transfer resistance (Rctr), and charge recombination resistance (Rrec) at the interface between the perovskite/HTL, and two constant phase elements related to carrier diffusion in the perovskite and selective layers (CPE1 and CPE2). We noted that at a given potential bias, the Rctr in the PSC with a 2D-WS2 interfacial layer is much lower than that of the control device, inferring that the interfacial layer plays a critical role in promoting the charge transfer dynamics at the perovskite/HTM interface (Fig. 4c). The relative trend of Rctr is in agreement with that of the Rs obtained from the J–V curves. This reduced Rs correlated with the lower Rctr further confers the enhanced FF of the device with the 2D-WS2 interfacial layer.44 Furthermore, at a similar potential bias, the PSC with the interfacial layer features a higher Rrec than the control device, which reflects the higher resistance for charge annihilating at the interface (Fig. 4d). The carrier recombination behaviour was further assessed using the semi-logarithmic J–V curve recorded in the dark (Fig. 4e). By fitting the exponential region of the curve with the Shockley equation, we obtain45,46  in which Jdark is the dark current density, J0 is the saturation current density, V is the applied voltage, q is the electron charge, KB is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature, and nid is the ideality factor. We estimated the J0 and nid for the control PSC to be 4.834 × 10−6 mA cm−2 and 2.69, respectively, and those for the device with the 2D-WS2 interface layer are 2.109 × 10−7 mA cm−2 and 2.47, respectively. Such low J0 and nid values associated with the use of the 2D-WS2 interface layer indicate a low leakage current density and significantly hindered carrier recombination, enhancing the charge transfer dynamics in the PSC. This escalates the FF, Voc, and subsequently the PCE of the PSC with the use of an interfacial layer.30,47 The dark current results are consistent with the Rrec obtained from the EIS measurements.
To identify the charge collection and exciton dissociation in the presence of the 2D-WS2 interlayer, we measured (Fig. 4f) the photocurrent density (Jph) as a function of effective voltage (Veff). The Jph is defined as the difference between the current density under illumination (JL) and in the dark (JD); (Jph = JL− JD). The term Veff follows the formula of Veff = V0 − V, where V0 is the compensation voltage defined as Jph = 0, and V is the applied voltage.47–49 Remarkably, the device with the 2D-WS2 interface layer displays a saturation of photocurrent at a relatively low Veff (0.3 V) compared to that of the control PSC (0.58 V), suggesting an effective charge extraction behaviour in the PSC with a 2D-WS2 interfacial layer. Ideally, the efficiency of charge dissociation and collection depends on the maximum exciton generation rate (Gmax), which follows the relationship of Jsat = eLGmax, where Jsat, e, and L are the saturated Jph, elementary charge, and the thickness of the perovskite layer, respectively.49 As tabulated (Table S4, ESI†), we calculated the Gmax to be 3.68 × 1021 s−1 for the 2D-WS2 interface-layer-based PSC that is slightly higher than 3.65 × 1021 s−1 for the control PSC. This enhanced Gmax suggests that the introduction of a 2D-WS2 layer at the PTAA/perovskite interface promotes the interfacial charge transfer dynamics in the PSCs.
Arguably, the photo-generated charge carriers can easily drift under an operational electric field and accumulate at the interfaces due to the poor band alignment and/or poor mobility of the charge transport layers or poor charge extraction, which promotes the charge build-up at the interface and consequently deficit the Voc.50–52 Additionally, the trap density plays the foremost role in governing the overall performance of the PSC in which the trapped charges at the interface show restriction to their mobility. The increase in trap density can further diminish the trapped charge carriers through nonradiative recombination, thereby limiting the PCE.51 To gain further insight into the charge accumulation behaviour at the perovskite/HTL interface with and without the 2D-WS2 interface layer, we performed the temperature-dependent capacitance–frequency (c–f) measurement.

Fig. 5a and b show the c–f data for PSCs as a function of temperature from 133.15–293.15 K under short circuit dark conditions. We noted that below 213.15 K, the geometrical capacitance, as determined from the constant capacitance plateau at the intermediate frequency region, freezes out in both devices. Deeper traps participate in the capacitance as the frequency decreases resulting in a capacitance build-up at the low-frequency region.53 In the low-frequency region, the control device shows limited capacitance build-up from low temperatures until 233.15 K, and later, thermally activated capacitance shows a significant increment that can be ascribed to the charge accumulation and build-up at the interfaces.53,54 In particular, the PSC with the additional interfacial layer displays a nearly constant capacitance until 253.15 K from low temperatures throughout the low-frequency region, and then it increases slightly, beyond this temperature. However, the capacitance build-up is high in the PSCs without the interfacial layer as compared to the PSC with the 2D-WS2 layer, confirming that the 2D-WS2 layer can hinder the charge accumulation at the perovskite/PTAA interface. Fig. S6 (ESI†) further illustrates the temperature-dependent capacitance variation in the PSC at low frequency (102 Hz). We investigated the trap profile associated with the PSCs by identifying the characteristic trap emission parameter, known as an attempt to escape frequency (v0), which represents the dynamics of trap emission and defines the maximum rate of detrapping the trapped charges. Fig. 5c and d illustrate the variation of the frequency of the peak emission rate (fpeak) of charges from the trap state with the temperature, in which the fpeak increases gradually with temperature from 133.15 K until room temperature and then plateau on a further increment of temperature (Fig. S7, ESI†). According to the Arrhenius relationship, the emission rate (en) of the trapped charge in a defect shows the following correlation with the associated trap activation energy ET,54  where en is the measurement frequency at peak (fpeak), Kb is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature. The calculated trap energy for the PSC with and without 2D-WS2 is 115.63 and 64.38 meV respectively from the trap energy plot (Fig. 5c and d). The corresponding v0 of the control PSC is 2.04 × 107 Hz, which is much higher than that of the PSC with the interface layer (1.38 × 106 Hz).

We identified the trap-state distributions and energies affected by the 2D-WS2 interface layer, by the trap state profile using thermal admittance spectra along with the Mott–Schottky spectra (Fig. 6a). At room temperature, the built-in-potential (Vbi) and the depletion layer thickness (w) obtained for the control PSC are 991.80 mV and 140.17 nm, respectively; expectedly, the PSC with the 2D-WS2 interface layer shows improved results achieving a Vbi of 1073.85 mV and a w of 236.10 nm. The increased Vbi and w values escalate the charge separation and transfer at the perovskite/PTAA interface. In the trap density profiles shown in Fig. 6b, at room temperature (303.15 K), for control PSCs, a peak trap density of 3.45 × 1017 cm−3 eV−1 at 0.134 eV appears, while the PSC with 2D-WS2 displays a smaller peak intensity of 2.58 × 1017 cm−3 eV−1 at a shallow energy level of 0.77 eV. Furthermore, the control PSC shows an intense trap density across the higher energy region from 0.3–0.36 eV. Based on these results, we can conclude that the 2D-WS2 interface layer can passivate charge traps at the perovskite interface. This highlights the critical role of the interface layer in controlling the interface charge separation and recombination in the device, leading to a significant improvement in Voc and PCE.

The beneficial role played by the incorporation of the 2D-WS2 layer in charge transfer dynamics while promoting PV performances led us to study its impact on the long-term operational stability; MPP tracking55 of un-encapsulated PSCs was conducted under 1 sun illumination at room temperature with 50–60% humidity (Fig. 7). The control PSCs reached 80% of their initial photocurrent after 8 h of continuous illumination and the photocurrent reduces continuously under ambient conditions, while, under similar conditions, the PSCs with the 2D-WS2 interface layer retained 80% of their initial photocurrent for 100 h. Moreover, the PSC with a 2D-WS2 interfacial layer showed more stabilized Jsc and Voc (Fig. 7b and c). 2D-WS2 deposited on the perovskite layer yielded a higher contact angle of 87 ± 1° compared to that of the bare perovskite (81 ± 1°) suggesting the hydrophobic nature associated with the 2D-WS2 that can mitigate the water penetration into the active perovskite layer in the PSC (Fig. S8, ESI†).

Conclusions
In summary, we demonstrated the role of 1T-rich 2D-WS2 nanosheets, particularly synthesized via Li+ intercalated liquid-phase exfoliation, in enhancing the optoelectronic properties via stimulating the photo-induced charge transfer dynamics and suppressing the surface trap density. We found that the trap density in the device decreased by 25% with a saturation of photocurrent at a relatively low Veff (0.3 V) due to the 2D-WS2 interfacial layer. The presented protocol based on the introduction of 2D-WS2 between the un-doped PTAA and the perovskite absorber enabled the demonstration of n–i–p PSCs with a stabilized efficiency of over 19%, paving the way toward reliability enhancement in PSCs for commercial viability.
Experimental
Materials
Lead iodide (99.9%) was purchased from Tokyo Chemical Industry (TCI) and employed as such. Methylammonium iodide (MAI) and formamidinium iodide (FAI) were purchased from Dyesol. Solvents including DMF, DMSO, ethyl acetate, ethanol, and chlorobenzene were purchased from Acros Chemicals and used as such.
Synthesis of 2D WS2
We performed the intercalation of WS2 according to the previous report.6,54 Briefly, 50 mg of bulk WS2 in 5 mL of butyl lithium/hexane solution was magnetically stirred for 48 h and then ultra-sonicated for 6 h. The resultant solution was left to stabilize and the upper solution was discarded. Excess butyl lithium was washed out by dilution with hexane and the residual was dispersed in isopropanol (IPA) and ultra-sonicated for 2 h. We centrifuged the resultant solution at 8000 rpm for 30 min, to remove the supernatant, and repeated the process. The residual was dispersed in IPA and centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 20 min and 80% of the upper supernatant was collected for device fabrication.
Device fabrication
We started by cleaning the laser-etched FTO-coated glasses (NSG10), with Hellmanex solution, deionized water, acetone, and IPA by ultrasonication in the specified order. We then dried the substrates under compressed air and treated them with UV–ozone for 30 min before use. A compact blocking layer of TiO2 was deposited onto FTO substrates by spray pyrolysis at 500 °C employing 1/19 mL of titanium(IV) diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) precursor solution (75% in 2-propanol) in pure ethanol keeping them for another 30 min. After the films acquired room temperature, the electrodes were subjected to UV–ozone treatment for another 15 min. The synthesized SnO2-QD solution was spin-coated atop of the compact layer at 500 rpm for 5 s and 5000 rpm for 35 s followed by annealing on a hot plate progressively at 200 °C for 1 h in air. Once cooled down to room temperature the samples were transferred to an argon-filled glovebox (H2O level: <1 ppm and O2 level: <10 ppm). Triple-cation perovskite layers were deposited by spin coating the perovskite precursor solution containing CsI (0.10 M), FAI (1.05 M), PbI2 (1.24 M), MABr (0.12 M), and PbBr2 (0.12 M) in an anhydrous solvent mixture of N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) with a 4:1 volume ratio. The perovskite precursor solution was spin-coated on the as-prepared SnO2-QD (ETL) coated electrode in a two-step spin-coating program set at 1000 rpm and 6000 rpm for 10 and 30 s. During the spin coating process, we slowly dripped 112 μL of chlorobenzene on the rotating substrate in the last 10 s before the termination of the program.54 The deposited perovskite was annealed at 100 °C for 1 h to induce crystallization. After cooling down to room temperature, 2D-WS2 in isopropanol solution was spin-coated at 1000 rpm for 20 s and dried at 60 °C for 3 min (this was repeated three times to achieve a continuous layer with an average thickness of 9 nm). Pristine PTAA (10 mg mL−1 in toluene) was spin-coated at 3000 rpm for 35 s. For control PSCs, we deposited PTAA directly on the perovskite active layer. The photovoltaic devices were completed by evaporating Au (80 nm, <1 Å s−1) in an evaporator under vacuum conditions below 10−7 torr.

Current density–voltage (J–V) curves were obtained using a 3A Oriel solar simulator (Newport) producing 1 sun AM1.5G (1000 W m−2). The generated photocurrent was recorded at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1 (pre-sweep delay: 10 s) with the help of a Keithley 2604 source meter. The active area of the device was 0.09 cm−2. We measure the IPCE using a 150 W xenon lamp attached to a Bentham PVE300 motorized 1/4m monochromator.

Trap density measurements. 
Temperature-dependent capacitance–frequency measurements were performed with an LCR meter, model no. E4980A, along with a Linkam (LTS420) sample heating control system filled with nitrogen in a closed environment. The energetic profile of trap density of state (tDOS) was calculated with the following equations:56,57      where Vbi is the built-in-potential, w is the depletion layer thickness, C is the capacitance measured at an angular frequency ω, T is the temperature, Kb is the Boltzmann constant, q is the elementary charge, ε is the relative dielectric constant of the perovskite (c is 13 from a previous report),57ε0 is the permittivity of free space and A is the active interfacial area.

Materials and thin-film characterization
X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) experiments were carried out on a SPECS system (Berlin, Germany) equipped with a Phoibos 150 1D-DLD analyzer with monochromated Al Kα radiation (1486.7 eV). The wide scan was performed with a step energy of 1 eV (dwell time: 0.1 s, pass energy: 80 eV), and a detailed analysis of the elements was performed using 0.08 eV step energy (dwell time: 0.1 s, pass energy: 30 eV) with an electron exit angle of 90°. The spectra were adjusted using CasaXPS 2.3.16 software, which models Gauss–Lorentzian contributions. X-ray diffractograms were recorded using a D8 Advance diffractometer from Bruker (Bragg–Brentano geometry, with an X-ray tube Cu Kα, λ = 1.5406 Å). For obtaining surface topologies and phase images, atomic force microscopy (CSI Nano observer AFM) was used and the data were analyzed using Gwyddion software. We recorded the absorption spectra with the help of a UV-vis-IR spectrophotometer (Varian Cary 50 UV/Vis Spectrophotometer). The cross-sectional and top-views of the microstructure were acquired with the help of a Hitachi S-4800 scanning electron microscope.
