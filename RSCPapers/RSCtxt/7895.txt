    , Accepted 4th October 2013First published on 7th October 2013AbstractA low-cost and easily-synthesized organic hole transport material (HTM) X3 bearing triphenylamine units and an organic dye was utilized for solid state dye sensitized solar cells (ssDSCs), which have achieved the power conversion efficiencies of 5.8% and 7.1% under 1 sun and 0.46 sun, respectively, outperforming the ssDSC based on Spiro-OMeTAD 5.4% (1 sun) and 6.4% (0.46 sun).
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) have received sustained attention as one of the promising photovoltaic technologies during the past two decades due to their low cost and high efficiency.1–4 Classic DSC devices adopted liquid electrolytes to undertake electron transfer between the photoelectrode and the counter electrode.2,5,6 To date, the highest efficiency of liquid-DSCs has reached 12.3% by employing a metal complex redox couple, Co(II/III)tris(bipyridyl) and porphyrin dye.7 In order to develop the solvent-free device, 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis-(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenyl-amine)9,9′-spiro-bifluorene (Spiro-OMeTAD) as this kind of HTM has been successfully applied in solid state dye sensitized solar cells (ssDSCs).8–11 Recently, an impressive efficiency of 7.2% was achieved with the combination of tris(2-(1H-pyrazol-1-yl)pyridine)cobalt(III) doped Spiro-OMeTAD and an organic photosensitizer Y123.12 Subsequently, the Pb based-perovskite mesoscopic heterojunction photovoltaics using Spiro-OMeTAD as HTM showed a surprising efficiency up to 10.9%.13,14 So far, Spiro-OMeTAD is still the best HTM for ssDSCs as well as mesoscopic heterojunction photovoltaics. However, the onerous synthesis of Spiro-OMeTAD requires five steps from commercially available materials.15–17 In addition, the raw materials are not cheap. These factors result in the extremely high cost of Spiro-OMeTAD, limiting its scale-up application in ssDSCs. Therefore, seeking low-cost and high-efficiency HTMs is especially important. Actually, inspired by the structures of HTMs in other electronic devices,18–20 some materials have been adopted as HTMs for ssDSCs since the first publication of Spiro-OMeTAD.21–29 In 2006, Durrant et al. developed several triarylamine-based oligomers and employed them as organic HTMs in ssDSCs; the best efficiency from these HTMs is around 2.0%.30 Two small organic HTMs AS37 and AS44 with low melting points and high solubility were reported by Sellinger et al. in 2012.31 Recently, carbazole-based and triphenylamine (OMe-TPD)-based small molecules have been obtained with 3.4% and 4.9% efficiencies, respectively.32,33 However, the values obtained by these new HTMs are still far behind the state of the art efficiency obtained by Spiro-OMeTAD in ssDSCs. Herein, we use a low-cost organic HTM X3 bearing an oligomer structure and easy synthetic route to cooperate with an organic dye LEG4 in ssDSCs, giving an efficiency (η) of up to 5.8%, which is superior to Spiro-OMeTAD based ssDSCs (5.4%) under standard AM 1.5 solar light of 100 mW cm−2 intensity (1 sun). At 0.46 sun light illumination, an impressive 7.1% efficiency was obtained by an X3-based device. Although BASF Company has reported a 4.4% efficiency of ssDSCs based on X3 as HTM and D102 dye under 1 sun in their patent,27 the value is still much lower than that we got in this work. Furthermore, we also systematically investigated the effect of different dyes and HTMs on ssDSC performance.
The structures of HTMs X3, Spiro-OMeTAD, organic dye LEG434 and referenced Ru dye Z90735 used in this study are shown in Scheme 1. The synthetic procedure of X3 was straightforward (see ESI†). Inexpensive starting materials were utilized to synthesize the desired material X3 by two step palladium-catalyzed Buchwald–Hartwig reaction. The last step adopted one-pot reaction, yielding the final product X3 up to 91% after final column chromatography purification. More synthetic details can be found in the Experimental section and ESI.† The dye LEG4 has similar molecular structure to the reported dyes Y12336 and D51.37 Considering the effect of different concentrations of Li+ doping in Spiro-OMeTAD on photovoltaic performance,38,39 we also optimized the amount of lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Li-TFSI) added into the X3 and Spiro-OMeTAD under our lab conditions (Tables S2 and S3†). The final Li+ doping concentrations for X3 and Spiro-OMeTAD are determined to 30 mM and 20 mM, respectively. Fig. 1 shows the J–V curves of LEG4-ssDSCs based on X3 and Spiro-OMeTAD under different light intensities. All photovoltaic parameters of ssDSCs are collected in Table 1. We found that, under 1 sun illumination, the devices based on the new HTM X3 and LEG4 yielded a higher efficiency of 5.8% with a JSC of 9.70 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.90 V and a fill factor (FF) of 0.66. Even a much higher efficiency of up to 7.1% from the X3-based LEG4 device can be achieved under 0.46 sun light illumination. The devices achieved higher efficiency under low light intensity than that under high light intensity because the hole electron recombination rate is dependent on the light intensity.40 After 1 month storage in the dark, the LEG4 ssDSCs based on X3 still gave an aged efficiency of 5.0% with a JSC of 8.12 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.99 V and an FF of 0.62. The ssDSCs based on the classic HTM Spiro-OMeTAD, under 1 sun light illumination, gave a referenced efficiency of 5.4% with a short-circuit photocurrent density (JSC) of 8.90 mA cm−2, an open-circuit photovoltage (VOC) of 0.94 V and an FF of 0.65. Z907-based devices using X3 and Spiro-OMeTAD exhibited 3.7% and 3.5% efficiencies under 1 sun light illumination, respectively.

Fig. 2 shows the J–V curves and incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra (inset) of different dye-based ssDSCs using X3 and Spiro-OMeTAD as HTMs. For LEG4 dye, both HTMs exhibit the highest IPCE of 75% at the maximum absorption wavelength of 475 nm. However, the IPCE spectrum of LEG4 ssDSC based on X3 from 475 nm to 700 nm was wider than that of Spiro-OMeTAD due to greater Li+ doping41 in X3-based devices than that in Spiro-OMeTAD-based ones, which leads to the higher photocurrent density based on X3 than that of Spiro-OMeTAD. Z907-based devices using both X3 and Spiro-OMeTAD showed much lower current than X3-based devices ascribed to the lower extinction coefficient of Z90742 (12600 M−1 cm−1 at 515 nm in EtOH) than that of LEG434 (49000 M−1 cm−1 at 541 nm in DCM). Moreover, the VOC values are also different in these devices. Usually, the VOC in DSCs is determined by the difference between the oxidation potential (E) of the hole conductor and the quasi Fermi level in TiO2 (EF,n) under illumination of HTM,43 as described in the equation VOC = E − EF,n. The EF,n is dependent on both the TiO2 conduction band edge position (ECB) and the electron concentration in TiO2. The electron concentration is strongly dependent on the electron recombination rate, often referred to as the electron lifetime (τe), which is considered as the average time for survival of free and trapped electrons in TiO2 before recombining with the oxidized form of HTM.

In order to evaluate the redox potentials of X3 and Spiro-OMeTAD under our lab conditions, cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were performed in a solution system. According to the CV curves (see Fig. S4†), the redox potentials of X3 and Spiro-OMeTAD are determined to be 0.77 V and 0.63 V vs. normal hydrogen electrode (NHE). From the aspect of redox potential, X3 has a slightly more positive redox potential than Spiro-OMeTAD, which should be beneficial for producing higher VOC values in ssDSCs. However, from the results of photovoltaic measurements, Spiro-OMeTAD-based ssDSCs gave the highest VOC value, even though with the lower redox potential. The concentration of injected electrons in the TiO2 and holes injected in the HTM under illumination also affect the photovoltage, and a longer τe of these charges gives a higher photovoltage. Therefore, the different τe values of injected electrons in the devices based on these HTMs may be different. In order to verify our theory, the τe values plotted by VOC from these devices were measured by transient photovoltage decay, as shown in Fig. 3. At a certain VOC value, the τe value from the X3-based device is obviously lower than that from the device fabricated by Spiro-OMeTAD. Therefore, although X3 has a more positive redox potential level than Spiro-OMeTAD; the shorter τe results in depressed VOC values in the X3-based device, which could be ascribed to two aspects. First, the smaller amount of Li+ added in the Spiro-OMeTAD-based device could be responsible for the slower electron recombination process;38,39 this conclusion has also been proved by the experiments using different Li+ concentrations in devices (Fig. S5, S6 and Tables S2, S3†). Second, the slim molecule X3 could be favourable for improving the pore filling44,45 in the TiO2 electrode, which makes the HTM molecules easily approach the TiO2 interface, thus leading to the fast recombination process between injected electrons and oxidized HTMs (Fig. S8†).46 In comparison with Z907-based devices, all LEG4-based devices showed much longer lifetime owing to the bulky alkyl chain in LEG4, which can suppress the electron recombination process.

In conclusion, the combination between a low-cost and easily synthesized organic hole transport material (HTM) X3 and an organic dye LEG4 in solid state dye sensitized solar cells (ssDSCs) exhibited impressive power conversion efficiencies (η) of 5.8% and 7.1% under 1 sun and 0.46 sun, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, the efficiencies obtained by X3-based ssDSCs are the highest values among those reported using other alternative HTMs to Spiro-OMeTAD. Therefore, the present finding shows the possibility of developing new HTMs bearing with low cost and high efficiency for potential application in ssDSCs based on organic dyes. Furthermore, the experiment of different HTMs using different LiTFSI doping concentrations shows the possibility of evaluating more HTMs for ssDSCs. Further experiments with new dyes or inorganic materials using the HTM X3 and development of other more efficient HTMs to suppress the electron recombination process are in progress.
