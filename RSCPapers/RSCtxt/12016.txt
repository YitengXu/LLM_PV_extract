    , Accepted 1st November 2013First published on 8th November 2013AbstractTitanium dioxide (TiO2) is one of the most widely investigated metal oxides due to its extraordinary surface, electronic and catalytic properties. However, the large band gap of TiO2 and massive recombination of photogenerated electron–hole pairs limit its photocatalytic and photovoltaic efficiency. Therefore, increasing research attention is now being directed towards engineering the surface structure of TiO2 at the most fundamental and atomic level namely morphological control of {001} facets in the range of microscale and nanoscale to fine-tune its physicochemical properties, which could ultimately lead to the optimization of its selectivity and reactivity. The synthesis of {001}-faceted TiO2 is currently one of the most active interdisciplinary research areas and demonstrations of catalytic enhancement are abundant. Modifications such as metal and non-metal doping have also been extensively studied to extend its band gap to the visible light region. This steady progress has demonstrated that TiO2-based composites with {001} facets are playing and will continue to play an indispensable role in the environmental remediation and in the search for clean and renewable energy technologies. This review encompasses the state-of-the-art research activities and latest advancements in the design of highly reactive {001} facet-dominated TiO2via various strategies, including hydrothermal/solvothermal, high temperature gas phase reactions and non-hydrolytic alcoholysis methods. The stabilization of {001} facets using fluorine-containing species and fluorine-free capping agents is also critically discussed in this review. To overcome the large band gap of TiO2 and rapid recombination of photogenerated charge carriers, modifications are carried out to manipulate its electronic band structure, including transition metal doping, noble metal doping, non-metal doping and incorporating graphene as a two-dimensional (2D) catalyst support. The advancements made in these aspects are thoroughly examined, with additional insights related to the charge transfer events for each strategy of the modified-TiO2 composites. Finally, we offer a summary and some invigorating perspectives on the major challenges and new research directions for future exploitation in this emerging frontier, which we hope will advance us to rationally harness the outstanding structural and electronic properties of {001} facets for various environmental and energy-related applications.Wee-Jun OngMr Ong Wee Jun received his Bachelor of Engineering (First Class Honours) degree from Monash University in 2012.

1. Introduction
With industrialization and rapid population growth, the environmental pollution and energy shortages have steadily raised awareness of a potential global crisis and are becoming overwhelming concerns all over the world. For the sustainable development of human society, the advancement of both pollution-free technologies for environmental decontamination and alternative clean energy supplies is an urgent task. Among various green earth and renewable energy projects underway, semiconductor photocatalysis has gained considerable interdisciplinary attention and much research fascination due to its diverse potential in energy and environmental applications. Generally, photocatalytic application of wide reaching importance mainly involves the degradation of pollutants,1 water splitting for hydrogen production2 and photocatalytic conversion of CO2 to energy-rich hydrocarbon fuels3,4 and presents itself as a green chemistry technology.5
Since the first demonstration of photocatalytic water splitting using TiO2 electrodes by Fujishima and Honda under ultraviolet (UV) light in 1972,2 there has been significant progress in the design of efficient semiconductor photocatalysts. Thus, to date, developing high-quality, effective and stable semiconductor-based photocatalysts for the remediation of global air and water pollution has become a hot research field. In recent years, various kinds of semiconductor photocatalysts have been reported namely TiO2,6–10 ZnO,11–14 CdS,14–16 CdSe,17,18 SnO2,19,20 CuO,21,22 Cu2O,23,24 ZrO2,25 ZnFe2O4,26 ZnS,27 Fe2O3,28 Bi2O3,29,30 Bi2WO6,31,32 AgBr,33,34 AgCl,33 Ta2O5,35 Zn2GeO4,36,37 InNbO4,38 g-C3N4,39–42 WO3 (ref. 43 and 44) and so forth. Among a wide spectrum of semiconductors, TiO2 is by far the most researched photocatalytic material due to its long term stability, strong oxidizing power, high chemical inertness, corrosion resistance, non-toxicity, cost effectiveness and environmentally benign nature.6,45–48 Generally, TiO2 exists in four polymorphs namely anatase (tetragonal, space group I41/amd), rutile (tetragonal, space group P42/mnm), brookite (orthorhombic, space group Pbca) and TiO2(B) (monoclinic, space group C2/m).49–51 Among the four different crystalline phases of TiO2, anatase TiO2 has been widely accepted to possess the most photoactive reactivity in catalytic applications.52,53 In comparison to anatase TiO2, the rutile phase is less reactive owing to its higher recombination rate of electron–hole pairs and also a lower surface affinity for many organic compounds.54 Fewer studies on the photoactivity of brookite and TiO2(B) have been reported.49 A number of extensive reviews on the recent development in the synthesis of TiO2 nanostructures and their applications have been reported by Linsebigler et al.,55 Chen and Mao,56 Ismail and Bahnemann,57 Froschl et al.,58 Rehman et al.,59 Liu et al.,60 Chen and Caruso,61 Zhang et al.,62 Pelaez et al.63 and Cai and Qi64 covering various synthesis routes such as sol–gel, hydrothermal, solvothermal, non-hydrolytic alcoholysis, sonochemical and microwave treatment.
Spherical TiO2 nanoparticles are commonly used as photocatalysts due to their high surface-to-volume ratio providing a great number of surface active sites.65 However, the main problems, i.e. low quantum efficiency due to recombination of electron–hole pairs favored by the small size of the nanocrystals and inactive under visible light irradiation due to wide band gap of TiO2 to the UVA spectral range,66 hamper and retard widespread practical applications for commercial benefits. Therefore, the current TiO2 properties need to be further improved for their photocatalytic enhancement and absorption in the visible light region. To circumvent and resolve all the aforementioned shortcomings for improved visible light and better separation of charge carriers, a variety of modification strategies have been used to enhance the photocatalytic performance of the bare TiO2 such as co-catalyst loading, semiconductor heterojunctions and modification of crystal structures.67,68 These include the incorporation of transition metals into TiO2,69,70 doping of non-metals into TiO2,71 deposition of noble metals72 and coupling different semiconductors with TiO2.73 Despite many attempts at improving the photocatalytic enhancement via different modification strategies as mentioned earlier, effective and commercially viable photocatalysts for photocatalytic applications are yet to be realized. Therefore, significant attention is now being directed towards designing and fabricating the surface structure of photocatalysts at the most fundamental and atomic level namely morphological control of TiO2 crystal facets in the range of microscale and nanoscale.
Generally, there are three fundamental low-index facets exposed in TiO2 crystals: {001}, {010} and {101} surfaces as illustrated in Fig. 1.74 At present, the design and morphological control of crystal facets of anatase TiO2 is considered to be a hot spot in scientific research and another fresh recent venture in the area of TiO2 although it is still in its infancy.75–78 Apart from the widely reported photocatalytic studies, many other promising applications such as heterogeneous catalysis, photovoltaic cells, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), lithium ion batteries, photo-/electrochromics, gas sensing, gas adsorption and smart surface coatings are very sensitive to the surface atomic structures, which can be finely tuned by morphological control and specifically the exposed specific crystal facets.79–92 Taking an example of DSSCs, DSSCs based on two-dimensional (2D) TiO2 nanosheets with dominant {001} facets have been proven to be efficient in boosting the photoelectric (light-to-electricity) conversion efficiency due to the fact that the 2D nanostructures enhance the efficiency of light collection by multiple light scattering and also the electron transfer rate.93,94 Therefore, synthesis of high energy facets of TiO2 composites is always desired to improve their properties and extend their applications. Recently, an important breakthrough and success in the preparation of micro-sized anatase TiO2 with approximately 47% highly reactive {001} facets by Yang et al.95 have stimulated incessant research interest worldwide in the preparation, modification and application of the high energy {001} facets owing to their intrinsic shape dependent properties. The order of the average surface energies of anatase TiO2 reported in the literature is 0.90 J m−2 for {001}, >0.53 J m−2 for {100}, and >0.44 J m−2 for {101}.48,96,97 Typically, anatase TiO2 crystals are primarily dominated by the most naturally appearing, less reactive and thermodynamically stable {101} surfaces which constitute more than 94% of the total exposed surface based on the Wulff construction.95,98–100 The most common TiO2 crystal shape observed in nature is the truncated octahedral bipyramid comprising eight {101} facets on the sides and two {001} facets on the top and bottom truncation facets (Fig. 1a).101,102 This is because during the crystal growth processes under equilibrium conditions, the high energy {001} facets diminish rapidly and hence the crystal spontaneously transforms into a specific shape with exposed facets that minimize the total surface free energy.9,87,103,104 Indeed, each crystal has its aspect ratio which is defined by the ratio between the side of the truncation facets ((B) in Fig. 1a) and the side of bipyramid ((A) in Fig. 1a). The typical degree of truncation (B/A) ranged from 0.3 to 0.4 over a wide range of conditions providing less than 10% of the exposed {001} facets.101
 Fig. 1  Evolution of an anatase TiO2 crystal nucleus nucleated as a truncated octahedral bipyramid seed: (a) under equilibrium conditions, the high energy {001} facets diminish rapidly and the crystal evolves into thermodynamically stable {101} facets. (b and c) Under non-equilibrium conditions, the high energy {001} and {010} facets are stabilized by selective adhesion of capping agents. The side lengths labelled as (A) and (B) are used to estimate the degree of truncation (B/A) and also calculate the percentage of exposed {001} facets. 
In spite of this constraint, both theoretical and experimental studies demonstrated that the catalytic reactivity of anatase TiO2 {001} facets is higher than that of the thermodynamically stable {101} surfaces.105–107 It is reasonable to infer that higher surface energy of {001} facets is more efficient for dissociative adsorption of reactant molecules as compared with that of {101} facets due to the low atomic coordination numbers of exposed atoms, a high density of active unsaturated coordination Ti atoms and active surface oxygen atoms with wide bond angles of Ti–O–Ti in the {001} facets.74,107–109 Additionally, it is noted that the TiO2 nanosheets with a low defect density can reduce the recombination rate of the photogenerated electron–hole pairs at the grain boundaries for achieving high energy conversion efficiency.110 Furthermore, the enhancement in the visible light absorption of anatase TiO2 nanosheets with exposed energetic {001} facets could be achieved by doping with metals and non-metals. So far, faceted TiO2 has been doped with various elements such as nickel,111 molybdenum,112 platinum,108 aurum,113 nitrogen,114–116 sulfur,117 fluorine118 and carbon.119
Many more of the novel forms of {001} facet-dominated anatase TiO2 (Fig. 1b and c) have received widespread attention in the past two years. Reviews on these highly reactive {001} faceted-pure anatase TiO2 composites have been published in the literature.120,121 However, despite the increasing research on the well-defined anatase TiO2-based composites with a high percentage of {001} facets during the past two years, work in this astonishing area has perhaps gained less coverage in the recent wider reviews than is warranted. A tremendous amount of research has been done each and every day and it is believed that the amount of literature on the development of highly energetic {001} facets of TiO2-based composites for various applications will bloom over the next few years. There exist endless unexplored opportunities regarding the synthesis routes of such composites and hence, at present, no review can be complete. Therefore, research in controllable synthesis of anatase TiO2-based composites with exposed {001} facets is moving at a sufficient pace such that another focused review is timely to promote the state-of-the-art developments in this exciting area of research for the benefit of human race. To the best of our knowledge, there are no comprehensive and thorough reviews on both the {001}-faceted pure and modified-TiO2 for the enhanced activity over the thermodynamically stable low energy {101} facets. As a result, this has led to explosion of our interest in highlighting the recent progress of this extraordinary field. However, this review should persuade even die-hard skeptics that the {001} facet-dominated TiO2-based crystal is not a transitory fashion, but rather, is here to stay, offering new inroads that never cease to bring surprises to the world of materials science besides acting as a fertile ground for various promising applications.
The review begins by focusing on the synthesis routes to obtain pure anatase TiO2 with exposed {001} facets. In this section, we review two main strategies in preparing the {001}-faceted TiO2: (1) with the use of fluorine-containing species and (2) through a relatively greener route with non-fluorine shape directing agents. This is then followed by the synthesis procedures to prepare modified-TiO2 with exposed {001} facets, which include transition metal doping, noble metal doping, non-metal doping and incorporating graphene as a 2D catalyst support. In these sections, we have also critically reviewed on the characterizations and formation mechanisms of the as-synthesized TiO2-based composites with {001} facets. Last but not least, we will present a brief summary and an outlook on the major challenges and some invigorating perspectives for future research in this emerging frontier. All in all, advancements in TiO2-based composites with exposed highly reactive {001} facets are expected to be a robust means to address both energy and environmental-related problems which are two of the biggest challenges faced by society today. We hope that this review can further promote the design and fabrication of novel materials with unique and extraordinary performances and also expand their functional applications as photoactive composites using solar energy to imitate the natural photosynthesis in plants, which is regarded as an ideal alternative since it is the most powerful, affordable (cost-free) and richest renewable and sustainable source of energy.
2. Synthesis strategies of {001} facet-dominated pure TiO2
The key in controlling the percentage of exposed crystallographic facets of TiO2 is to alter the relative stability of every facet during crystal growth. The different facets of TiO2 nanocrystals are intrinsically determined by the various surface energies. It is well-known that solvents, impurities and additives in the solution can markedly affect the ultimate shape of the crystals.122–124 Surface adsorption of capping agents (impurities or additives in the reaction medium), which interact differently with the different crystalline facets, has been expected to be an efficient strategy in designing faceted nanocrystals leading to various dominant reactive facets.101 The role of capping agents is crucial to selectively adsorb and hence reduce the surface free energy of materials with more active sites inhibiting the crystal growth along the corresponding direction (Fig. 2). This in turn results in the preservation of highly reactive crystal facets by tuning the growth rates to the specific crystal facets. Equally important, the effect of solvent on the reaction environment is of utmost significance for the crystal shape via the interactions between solvent and solute along specific orientations in a crystal. This is due to the fact that surface atomic arrangement and surface affinity of each orientation for the solvent are different which can considerably influence the growth rates and eventually the final shape of the crystals.124,125 The role of solvent and impurities or the additive effect in controlling the final shape of the TiO2 crystals is schematically illustrated in Fig. 2.

Numerous methods have been developed to fabricate anatase TiO2 nanocrystals dominated with {001} facets. Among all, surface fluorination is known to be the most effective and exceptional method for stabilizing the {001} facets in fluorine-terminated anatase TiO2 crystals on the basis of the first-principles calculations.95 Recently, increasing efforts have focused on exploring various synthesis pathways to develop anatase TiO2 with a large percentage of reactive {001} facets.99,103,126–128 Generally, there are various techniques to determine the percentage of {001} facets of TiO2-based composites such as field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Raman spectroscopy. As for the FESEM and TEM methods, the dimensions of the crystallites are measured to estimate the percentage of {001} facets and thus the respective areas of the {001} and {101} facets are determined as exemplified in Fig. 3. Commonly, the percentage of {001} facets is calculated by assuming that these two facets make up nearly 100% of all the surfaces.104,129 The detailed calculations for the estimation of the {001} facet percentage are shown in eqn (1)–(3). S001 = 2a2(1) (2) (3)where θ is the theoretical value for the angle between the {001} and {101} facets of the anatase TiO2 single crystal. As shown in the slab model (Fig. 3a), b and a denote lengths of the side of the bipyramidal and the side of the square {001} ‘truncation’ facets, respectively.119
 Fig. 3  (a) Slab model of an anatase TiO2 single crystal. (b) Equilibrium model of an anatase TiO2 single crystal used for the calculation of geometrical characteristics.119 
Besides that, XRD is one of the viable approaches for characterizing the percentage of exposed {001} facets in anatase TiO2. Taking into account that the deformation growth of anatase TiO2 from octahedron to truncated octahedron results in the formation of the exposed {001} facets, the percentage of the exposed {001} facets will increase if the up and down crystal growth was inhibited. According to the Scherrer equation, the broad peak of (004) diffraction represents the decreased size along the [001] axis vertical to the {001} facets, suggesting the enhanced percentage of the exposed {001} facets.130 On the other hand, the enhanced intensity of the (101) peak corresponds to the increased crystallite size along the [101] axis vertical to the {101} facets, which also implies the enhanced percentage of the exposed {001} facets.130 Based on these two diffractions, the thickness of the TiO2 in the [001] direction and the length in the [101] direction can be calculated from the full width at half maximum of (004) and (101) diffraction peaks, respectively. The percentage of the exposed {001} facets can be estimated from the ratio between peak intensities of (004) and (101). However, a large sampling volume is required and the sweep speed is very slow by using the XRD method.131
Recently, Tian et al.131 reported a new Raman spectroscopy technique to measure the percentage of anatase TiO2 exposed {001} facets from the micro-perspective of molecular bonding. The Raman peaks are basically originated from the vibration of molecular bonds, which are of high measuring sensitivity. In principle, the molecular bands are in different manners on various crystal planes. Owing to that, when the exposed {001} facets vary in different percentages, the intensity of the Raman vibration modes will exhibit different values. Based on the experimental results and theoretical analysis, the {001} facets exposed percentage of anatase TiO2 can be determined from the peak intensity ratio of the Eg and A1g peaks.132
In this section, the synthesis processes using various types of capping agents (with and without fluorine-containing species) are reviewed. Section 2.1 critically presents the recent development of employing fluorine morphology-controlling agents for achieving high energy {001} facets such as hydrofluoric acid (HF),133 ammonium fluoride (NH4F),134 sodium fluoroborate (NaBF4),116 sodium fluoride (NaF),9 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluroborate,8 titanium(IV) fluoride (TiF4)135 and ammonium hexafluorotitanate ((NH4)2TiF6)98 whereas Section 2.2 focuses on the non-fluorine shape-directing agents such as oleic acid (OA),136 oleylamine (OM),137 urea,100 ammonium carbonate,100 diethylenetriamine (DETA),87 diethanolamine (DEA),138 poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP),139 polyvinyl alcohol (PVA),140 hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)141 and chloride.110Table 1 summarizes the various preparation methods of bare TiO2 particles with exposed high energy {001} facets.

2.1. Strategies involving fluorine-containing species
To investigate the effects of various adsorbate on the stability of {001} facets, Yang et al.95 have systematically explored a range of 12 non-metallic adsorbate atoms X (X = H, B, C, N, O, F, Si, P, S, Cl, Br and I) by performing first-principles calculations. The calculated surface energies (γ) for all the 12 adsorbates are illustrated in Fig. 4a. Referring to Fig. 4a, two conclusions were: (1) F-terminated anatase TiO2 surfaces have the lowest γ for both {001} and {101} facets among the 12 non-metal-terminated surfaces and (2) {001} facets are preferential and more stable compared to {101} facets for F-terminated anatase TiO2 crystals. Moreover, based on the shape dependent thermodynamic model, the F-terminated anatase surfaces exhibited the highest degree of truncation (B/A) of approximately 0.9 and possessed more than 90% of exposed {001} facets (S001/S) (Fig. 4b). Therefore, based on their experimental results, it could be solidly verified and concluded that a strong preferential interaction between fluorine and the {001} facets of anatase TiO2 crystals significantly enhances the relative stability of the {001} facets during the crystal growth by modifying and reducing the surface energy of the {001} facets.

2.1.1. HF-mediated morphology control of {001}-faceted pure TiO2. 
The successful synthesis of anatase TiO2 single crystals with 47% exposed {001} facets was first achieved by Yang et al.,95 using TiF4 as the raw material and HF as a shape-controlling agent. Subsequently, Han's group demonstrated that the hydrothermal reaction of titanium(IV) butoxide (TBOT) and HF yielded nanosized sheet-like anatase TiO2 with up to 89% of {001} facets.99 Following these breakthroughs, there has been an upsurge of research interest in the controlled synthesis of anatase crystals with varied percentages of exposed {001} facets.8,76,77,86,90,92,105,126,127,131,142–173 Among all fluorine-containing compounds, HF is one of the most commonly used capping agents in the preparation of anatase TiO2 with highly reactive {001} facets. In general, the roles of HF are to (1) dissolve the titanium powders and retard the hydrolysis rate of titanium precursors, (2) reduce the surface energy to facilitate the growth of {001}-faceted surfaces, and (3) preserve the grown {001} facets.95,157,163 As a dissolution reagent, HF provides the basic building materials for structural formation.174,175 Various morphologies of high energy {001}-dominated anatase TiO2 have been prepared and their superior performances in areas such as photocatalytic degradation of pollutants,99,160,176 water splitting for hydrogen generation151,164 and lithium ion batteries90,156 have been well documented as well. In the upcoming sub-sections, different morphologies of anatase TiO2 crystals obtained using HF as the shape-controlling agent will be extensively discussed.
2.1.1.1. TiO2 sheets with high energy {001} facets. 
2.1.1.1(a). TiO2 microsheets. 
High quality truncated bipyramids of isotropic anatase TiO2 crystals with reactive {001} facets were first reported by Yang and co-workers in 2008 (Fig. 5a).95 Based on symmetries of anatase TiO2, for a single truncated bipyramid shape, the two flat and square surfaces in the crystal structure correspond to {001} facets whereas the four isosceles trapezoidal surfaces are assigned to {101} facets.95 The interfacial angle between the aforementioned surfaces was measured to be 68.3° ± 0.3° on average (Fig. 5b), which agreed well with the theoretical value for the angle between {001} and {101} facets of anatase.96

To this end, many studies have been devoted to the design and synthesis of crystalline anatase TiO2 with a large percentage of exposed {001} facets. Liu's group prepared anatase TiO2 single crystals with exposed {001} and {110} facets using a modified hydrothermal method in the presence of H2O2 and HF.157 Interestingly, four additional vertical rhombus facets were observed in the corners of the single crystals. The authors ascribed these rhombus surfaces to the highest surface energy {110} facets. It was believed that the addition of H2O2 reacted with Ti4+ to form a complex, which further decreased the hydrolysis of the titanium precursor. The reduced hydrolysis rate permitted sufficient time for better packing of Ti–O–Ti chains to grow well formed anatase single crystals and also allowed better adsorption of fluoride ions on the surfaces of the TiO2 crystals.
Yang and co-workers also investigated the concept of synergetic functionality, in which 2-propanol was added together with HF to synthesize high quality anatase TiO2 crystals with 64% of exposed {001} facets.163 It was reported that 2-propanol not only acted as a reaction medium, but also as a protecting agent177 to manipulate the isotropic growth of anatase TiO2 crystals. Under acidic conditions, propanol heterolytically dissociated to form alkoxy groups ((CH3)2CHO−) which bound to coordinatively unsaturated Ti4+ cations on the {001} and {100} surfaces. With the higher density of Ti5c, selective adhesion of 2-propanol on {001} facets was favored, which in turn led to the retardation of anatase TiO2 crystal growth along the [001] direction.163,178 In addition to 2-propanol, others alcohols such as tert-butanol and benzyl alcohol have also been experimentally proven to serve as synergetic capping agents, which are effective in obtaining larger percentages of high energy {001} facets.154 Apart from the synergetic effect of alcohols and fluorine in the stabilization of {001} facets, another advantage of adding alcohol is to promote greater flexibility in synthesizing anatase TiO2 crystals with uniform shapes and sizes.154
Mechanistically, most papers have exclusively reported that the surface fluorination under acidic conditions is responsible for reducing the surface energy of {001} facets and also preserving the as-grown facets.90,95,99,149,151,163 Zhang and co-workers conducted an extensive study on the mechanistic role of HF in the controlled growth of anatase TiO2 crystals with exposed {001} facets.175 By simply manipulating the pH of HF solution, the extent of surface fluorination and hence the size, shape, morphology and {001}-faceted surface area of the TiO2 crystals could be effectively controlled. Fig. 6a–f show the SEM images of the as-prepared TiO2 samples obtained at different pH values. It can be seen that at pH 1.2, TiO2 microspheres with a mean size of 2.1 μm were obtained. Interestingly, as the pH increased to 5.8, the TiO2 microspheres gradually disappeared and dispersive TiO2 nanocrystals with a truncated bipyramid shape were formed. DFT calculations revealed that under acidic conditions, the dissociative adsorption of HF molecules on {001}-faceted surfaces was energetically favorable due to the strong adsorption energy of −1.75 eV (Fig. 6g, Path A). On the other hand, the interaction of Na+F− (Na+ originates from NaOH for solution pH manipulation) with the {001}-faceted surfaces was thermodynamically prohibited as shown by the calculated adsorption energy of +0.47 eV (Fig. 6g, Path B).175 Based on these results, the authors confirmed that the presence of the molecular form of HF but not F− was vital for retaining the high energy {001} facets. At pH ≥ 6.6, the insufficient concentration of HF would significantly reduce the extent of surface fluorination, resulting in the production of anatase TiO2 crystals with {101} facets and titanate nanorods/nanosheets as shown in Fig. 6d–f.175

In another paper, Wang and co-workers provided additional insights into the mechanistic role of surface fluorination for the controlled growth of crystal facets.179 They demonstrated a selective etching phenomenon on the {001}-faceted anatase TiO2 single crystal surface by HF and proposed an etching mechanism based on DFT calculations. Fig. 7a and b show the SEM and TEM images of the anatase TiO2 crystals synthesized from 4.5 mM TiF4 aqueous solutions (pH = 1.52). The SAED pattern (bottom left inset in Fig. 7b) confirms that the square-shaped plane facet is a single crystal with the zone axis being [001], and hence the square faceted surface must be the {001} surface.163 This was further confirmed using HRTEM (bottom right inset in Fig. 7b), which showed a perpendicular lattice spacing of 0.19 nm between the (200) and (020) atomic planes.95,163 When the concentration of TiF4 was increased to 5.2 mM, an eroded {001}-faceted surface could be observed, as shown in Fig. 7c. The severity of the erosion was found to be proportional to the concentration of TiF4 (Fig. 7d and e). Interestingly, all isosceles trapezoidal {101}-faceted surfaces remained intact while the erosion took place on the {001}-faceted surfaces. This selective etching phenomenon on the {001}-faceted TiO2 crystal was ascribed to the geometrical arrangement of oxygen and titanium on {001} and {101}-faceted surfaces. Fig. 7f shows the DFT calculated reaction energies and structures for different stages of HF interaction with single crystal anatase TiO2 surfaces. Under high concentrations, HF selectively destroyed the grown {001}-faceted surface through the surface –OH replacement and –TiOF2 dissolution process (eqn (4)). The calculated dissolution reaction energies were −0.41 and +0.04 eV for {101} and {001}-faceted surfaces, respectively. This indicated that the proposed etching mechanism was energetically permitted solely for {001}-faceted surfaces. Similar observations were also reported by Yang and co-workers.145 The authors found that the addition of isopropanol, which acted as a synergistic stabilizer of {001}-faceted anatase TiO2, could effectively retard the rate of this etching phenomenon. (4)

On the other hand, several papers have reported that oxygen deficiency in anatase TiO2 plays a significant role in positively contributing to the reactivity of anatase TiO2 in heterogeneous reactions.180–182 In addition to induced electronic structure modifications, the oxygen deficiencies can essentially serve as specific reaction sites for reactant molecules in heterogeneous reactions.182 By incorporating the merits of {001} facets and oxygen deficiency, Liu and co-workers demonstrated a facile approach to prepare oxygen-deficient anatase TiO2 sheets with dominant {001} facets.183 The surface fluorine species and oxygen deficiency was reported to trigger obvious surface reconstruction of the TiO2 sheets. Importantly, such reconstruction was proposed to strengthen the interaction between Pt-loaded anatase sheets and the TiO2 matrix via a special electron-transfer process involving oxygen vacancies (Fig. 8). By comparing the efficiency for hydrogen generation of anatase sheets loaded with 1 wt% Pt, the as-prepared oxygen-deficient anatase TiO2 sheets with exposed {001} facets showed a remarkably higher hydrogen evolution rate than the sheets free of oxygen deficiency (2332 vs. 1333 μmol h−1 m−2).

2.1.1.1(b). TiO2 nanosheets. 
In earlier studies, the as-synthesized anatase TiO2 crystals exhibited large particle sizes and hence relatively small specific surface areas. It is widely known that the reactivity of catalysts is directly linked to their sizes, and many reports have confirmed the important effects of particle size on the photoreactivity of anatase TiO2 crystals.127,176,184 With large particle sizes, their improvement in photocatalytic activities would be intrinsically restricted. Therefore, it is clearly desirable to achieve small-sized anatase TiO2 crystals with preferential {001} facets. In 2009, Han and co-workers successfully synthesized relatively small (wide length ∼40 nm; thickness ∼6 nm) anatase TiO2 nanosheets with a large percentage (89%) of exposed {001} facets.99 The as-prepared TiO2 nanosheets showed superior photocatalytic efficiencies, which far exceeded that of commercial P25. The thinnest anatase TiO2 nanosheets (∼1.6 nm) with 82% of exposed {001} facets were prepared by Yang's group using a one-pot hydrothermal route (Fig. 9a–c).164 By studying the gradual changes in morphologies, the authors proposed that the crystal growth of anatase TiO2 nanosheets followed an Ostwald ripening process (Fig. 9d). Initially, the anatase TiO2 nanosheets were found to exhibit irregular shapes and sizes. Then these nanosheets gradually developed into a quasi-square morphology via an intra- or inter-Ostwald ripening process. At the end of the reaction, uniform TiO2 nanosheets with dominant {001} facets were achieved.

By simply changing the atomic ratio of F to Ti, Xiang's group demonstrated that the percentage of reactive {001} facets could be effectively tuned.185 When the atomic ratio of F to Ti was increased from 0 to 2.67, the percentage of exposed {001} facets showed an increase from 10 ± 1% to 78 ± 9%. However, when the F to Ti atomic ratio was fixed at 1, the exposed {001} facets with 70% showed higher photoactivity for the degradation of acetone in air, as compared to TiO2 with 78% {001} facets. This indicates the existence of an optimum relative percentage of exposed anatase {001} facets. At percentages higher than 70%, the small amount of {101} facets is not beneficial for the transfer and separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs and their synergetic effect on photoactivity. Therefore, the relative percentage of exposed {001} and {101} facets is a very important parameter in determining the photocatalytic activity of anatase TiO2 crystals.186
For commercial applications which require high temperatures (e.g. ceramic based building materials), it is of utmost importance to develop photoactive anatase TiO2 with superior thermal stability.187–191 Lv and co-workers demonstrated that anatase TiO2 nanosheets with dominant {001} facets exhibited a remarkable thermal stability against anatase-to-rutile phase transition up to 1100 °C.192 This was attributed to two primary factors: (1) good crystallization of anatase TiO2 nanosheets and (2) the formation of oxygen vacancies. A number of papers have reported that the presence of fluoride ions would accelerate the crystallization and growth of anatase TiO2 due to rapid in situ dissolution–recrystallization, which would in turn reduce the number of defects and impurities in the TiO2 lattice (eqn (5) and (6)).155,193,194 Zhang and co-workers found that the formation of the rutile phase starts at the interfaces between anatase particles in the agglomerated TiO2 particles.195 This is due to the higher number of defects or impurities on the surface than those in the lattice. The atoms at these defects possess higher energies than those in the main lattice, which could serve as nucleation sites for the formation of the rutile phase at the surface of anatase crystallites.195 Thus, it can be inferred that the anatase-to-rutile transition temperature increases with lower number of surface defects. 4H+ + TiO2 + 6F− → TiF62− + 2H2O (dissolution)(5) TiF62− + 2H2O → 4H+ + TiO2 + 6F− (recrystallization)(6)
The growth of anatase crystals occurs through the extension of Ti–O–Ti bridging by the dehydration between hydroxyl groups of neighboring TiO2 crystals (eqn (7)). Following the addition of HF, the adsorption of fluoride ions would replace the hydroxyl groups and in turn inhibits crystal growth (eqn (8)). With an increase in the calcination temperature, oxygen vacancies form due to desorption of surface-bounded fluorine. These oxygen vacancies lower the extension of Ti–O–Ti bridging and hence, the crystal growth. A schematic illustrating the hindrance effect of fluoride on the extensive Ti–O–Ti bridging is depicted in Fig. 10. The oxygen vacancies can be removed through the diffusion of lattice oxygen ions or oxygen in air. As the process requires additional energy, the anatase-to-rutile transition process is shifted to higher temperatures (eqn (9)).192 Ti–OH + HO–Ti → Ti–O–Ti + H2O (growth of nanocrystals)(7) Ti–OH + HF → Ti–F + H2O (replacement of hydroxyl groups)(8) Ti–F + heat → Ti–□ (oxygen vacancy)(9)

However, {001}-faceted anatase TiO2 nanosheets were revealed to be unstable during hydrothermal treatment in deionized water.159 During the treatment, original TiO2 sheets were observed to have grown into a truncated octahedral TiO2via an oriented attachment process along the [001] crystallographic direction (Fig. 11). Under hydrothermal coarsening conditions, the Ti–F bonds on the surface underwent hydrolysis (eqn (10)) and the F atoms were replaced by hydroxyl groups.196 Ti–F + H2O → Ti–OH + H+ + F−(10)

Following that, the authors reported that the {001} interfaces between adjacent anatase TiO2 nanosheets were eliminated through a condensation process of Ti–OH groups, thus forming Ti–O–Ti linkages. Interestingly, the reaction medium was found to play an important role in the morphology evolution of anatase TiO2 nanosheets. By replacing deionized water with other solvents such as ethanol, propanol, butanol and 1.5 M HCl aqueous solution, the anatase TiO2 nanosheets were found to have retained their original morphology. This observation once again justified the synergetic effect of alcohols and HF in retarding the surface hydrolysis of Ti–F groups and also stabilizing the as-grown {001} facets.154,163
Recently, the hydrogenation of anatase TiO2 nanosheets has attracted considerable research interest due to its effect in substantially enhancing visible light adsorption and photocatalytic activity.197–199 Wei and co-workers conducted systematic studies on the nature of the hydrogenation treatment and its correlation with the high energy {001} facets.200 The authors found that the hydrogenation of {001}-faceted TiO2 nanosheets resulted in the removal of most F atoms on the TiO2 surface and led to full surface coverage of Ti–H and O–H chemical bonds. Ti5c atoms on the {001} facets were fully coordinated by the formation of the Ti–H chemical bonds, which could be the reason for the retention of the {001} facets despite the removal of F atoms. In addition, a large amount of Ti3+ and oxygen vacancies were produced, both of which could induce the adsorption of O− species on the surface of TiO2–H. This resulted in significant narrowing of band gap and an improved photocatalytic activity of the TiO2–H. A schematic of the hydrogenation effect on structural changes in {001}-faceted TiO2 is illustrated in Fig. 12.

2.1.1.2. Spherical-shaped TiO2 with high energy {001} facets. 
Recently, the design and fabrication of TiO2 materials with hierarchical architectures have aroused much research interest in nanoscience and nanotechnology due to their many attractive properties. For example, TiO2 microspheres have been extensively studied owing to their unique optical properties and ease of recovery in practical applications.201–203
Zheng and co-workers reported a simple method to prepare anatase TiO2 microspheres with dominant {001} facets (up to 83%) by alcohothermal treatment of TBOT, absolute ethanol and 40% HF solution.126 Based on TEM measurements, the TiO2 microspheres were found to be composed of sheet-like nanostructures. Owing to the large percentage of {001} facets and high surface area, the TiO2 microspheres showed a significant enhancement in photocatalytic activity as compared to the commercial P25. Furthermore, the TiO2 microspheres were shown to possess excellent mechanical strength and stability under repeated use. Using anodized TiO2 nanotubes as the starting material, Hu and co-workers prepared unique structural single-crystalline anatase TiO2 ‘dous’ assembled microspheres (Fig. 13a–d).161 From Fig. 13d, the interfacial angles between the top and underside two parallel surfaces (flat square planes) and other surrounding isosceles trapezoidal surfaces were measured to be 111.7°, respectively, suggesting the presence of both {001} and {101} facets. Based on evolutional TEM images, the transformation from nanotubes to ‘dous’, and to the microspheres was proposed to follow a complex process involving the expansion of the nanotube, dissolution–recrystallization, and recombination (Fig. 13e). The opening and hollow ‘dous’ exposed one {001} facet with high surface energy and eight {101} facets, hence displaying excellent photocatalytic activity over pure TiO2 nanotubes and P25.161

Li's group synthesized hierarchical TiO2 nanospheres with controlled surface morphologies and dominant {001} facets directly from Ti powder by a one-pot hydrothermal method.158Fig. 14a–h show the SEM images of the hierarchical TiO2 nanospheres obtained at different reaction times. The authors proposed that Ti powder first dissolved in the HF solution, forming H2TiF6 (eqn (11)). Under hydrothermal conditions, H2TiF6 was hydrolyzed, and TiO2 nanostructures were formed according to eqn (12) and (13). During the early stages, the rapid hydrolysis of H2TiF6 resulted in the formation of hierarchical flower-like TiO2 through the coalescence of randomly oriented TiO2 circular cones. Initially, at high HF concentrations, the TiO2 cones were etched, forming truncated pyramids with bowl-like open hollows. When the F− ions were effectively absorbed on the crystal surfaces, the surface energy of {001} facets became lower than that of {101} facets and the hollow structures grew into mirror-like plane {001} facets. At the same time, the {101} facets also grew and finally met the {101} facets from adjacent truncated tetragonal pyramids. The coalescence of these facets then resulted in the formation of nanospheres with dominant {001} facets. With further extension of the reaction time, single crystal {001} facets of the TiO2 nanospheres would dissolve, leading to the formation of nanospheres with dominant {101} facets. The schematic of the proposed growth mechanism of hierarchical TiO2 nanospheres is depicted in Fig. 14i. Ti + 6HF → H2TiF6 + 2H2↑(11) H2TiF6 + 4H2O → Ti(OH)4 + 6HF(12) Ti(OH)4 → TiO2 + 2H2O(13)

In addition to the general core–shell structured microspheres, there has been increasing interest in the fabrication of TiO2 hollow structures due to their promising applications in optics, electronics, magnetism, catalysis, sensors and so forth.86,173,204 Very recently, Yu et al.86 synthesized three-dimensional (3D) anatase TiO2 hollow microspheres assembled with high energy {001} facets through a one-pot solution method. When tested as anode materials of lithium ion batteries, the 3D hollow microspheres delivered high capacity, good cycling stability and rate capability. It was expected that the 3D hierarchical architecture was of importance in preventing the aggregation of crystals, leading to the enhancement in the cycling stability. Therefore, the hollow nature and exposed high energy {001} facets of the 3D assembled electrode structure are envisaged to be of high potential for many electrochemical and photocatalytic applications due to its unique structural properties.
2.1.1.3. Flower-like TiO2 nanostructures with exposed {001} facets. 
As mentioned earlier in Section 2.1.1.2, nanomaterials with hierarchical architectures are gaining attention due to their many attractive properties. The majority of the synthesized anatase TiO2 reported in the literature are micro-sized crystals with 2D sheet-like nanocrystals or spherical particles closely packed by anatase TiO2 nanosheets.149,150,154,157 3D structures of single crystalline anatase TiO2 nanostructures are considered to exhibit excellent incident light scattering within the structures, as well as unique hierarchical characteristics.171,205 Moreover, these 3D structures are regarded to possess a larger number of active sites as compared to zero-dimensional (0D) or one-dimensional (1D) architectures.206,207 Flower-like nanostructures have been reported to show enhanced photocatalytic activities in various applications. For instance, Zhao and co-workers demonstrated that flower-like TiO2 nanostructures consisting of many nanorods possessed enhanced photocatalytic activity towards the photodegradation of organic contaminants.208 Therefore, the combination of unique flower-like structures and high energy {001} facets is expected to show remarkable efficiencies in photocatalytic applications.
Liu and co-workers synthesized the first flower-like TiO2 nanostructures with exposed {001} facets via a low temperature hydrothermal process.105 When tested for the degradation of methylene blue (MB) dye under UV light irradiation, the flower-like TiO2 nanostructure showed a two-fold enhancement in photocatalytic activity as compared to the commercial P25 TiO2 powder. Flower-like 3D hierarchical anatase TiO2 structures were also synthesized by Fang and co-workers.146 The method employed was similar to that employed by Liu and co-workers' except that isobutyl alcohol was used as the reaction medium. 2D nanosheets of anatase TiO2, which acted as the basic building units, assembled into flower-like hierarchical structures through the oriented attachment effect during crystal growth. The authors found that the concentration of the Ti precursor had a significant effect on the aggregation behavior of the TiO2 nanosheet building blocks. In this case, the anatase TiO2 building units first aggregated through a layer-by-layer mode and then assembled to form flower-like structures, which led to 3D expansion. Interestingly, during the layer-by-layer assembling process, the stacked anatase TiO2 nanosheets with exposed {001} facets still showed a Wulff construction principle, demonstrating an overall highly truncated bipyramidal morphology. The formation of such complex hierarchical structures was proposed to occur due to the reaction medium (isobutyl alcohol), which might have caused a change in the growth behavior of the initial building units as well as the interaction between them.146
Although the synthesis of {001} facet-dominated anatase TiO2 crystals has been widely reported, most of these samples are in powder form, which makes them difficult to be separated from water in a slurry system following the photocatalytic reaction. This causes a major constraint for many practical applications. Hence, in such cases, it is desirable to immobilize the TiO2 particles as thin films on a solid substrate.209 Xiang and co-workers reported a one-pot hydrothermal method to prepare hierarchically porous TiO2 films composed of flower-like TiO2 microspheres with exposed {001} facets directly on Ti foil (Fig. 15).160

During the hydrothermal treatment, HF is believed to play three primary roles: (1) etching the Ti substrate, thus providing the Ti source for the formation of flower-like TiO2 microspheres, (2) reducing the surface energy of {001} facets, making them more stable than the predominantly exposed {101} facets, and (3) serving as a selective etching reagent of multifaceted microspheres.174 Importantly, the authors found that the photocatalytic selectivity of the as-prepared TiO2 films towards the decomposition of azo dyes in water can be tuned by modifying the surface of the TiO2 microspheres as well as by varying the degree of etching of {001} facets. The adsorption selectivity of charged species could be controlled by altering the surface charge of TiO2. As the isoelectric point of TiO2 in water was around 5.8, the surface charge of TiO2 could be easily changed by a simple ligand exchange reaction between surface hydroxyl groups of TiO2 and H+ at acidic pH and/or OH− at alkaline pH (eqn (14)). Under acidic conditions, the surface of positively charged TiO2 would promote the selective adsorption of negatively charged contaminants, which resulted in the selective degradation. On the other hand, alkaline conditions are favorable for the degradation of positively charged contaminants.160 Owing to the ease of separation and tunable photocatalytic selectivity, the TiO2 films composed of multifaceted microspheres are expected to be developed as a robust means for the conversion and purification of targeted organics. (14)
2.1.1.4. Cuboidal-shaped TiO2 with high energy {001} facets. 
To date, there are various methods to fabricate ordered superstructures or hierarchical nanostructures, such as the self-assembly method, template method, topotactic transformation method and so forth.210,211 Among these methods, the topotactic transformation process is considered as one of the simplest and most cost effective methods, which can be easily scaled up for practical applications. In the process, similarities of crystal lattices and symmetries between the templates and products allow the arrangement of nanobuilding blocks for the construction of ordered hierarchical structures.168,210 However, the drawback of the template-engaged topotactic transformation process is that it is generally limited to the production of 1D or 2D nanostructures, and as discussed earlier in Section 2.1.1.3, 3D structures are preferable due to their many unique characteristics. To realize this, the exploration of desired templates out of a suitable material system becomes one of the key issues.212
Recently, titanium oxydifluoride (TiOF2) has been reported as an active photocatalyst, particularly in the photodegradation of 4-chlorophenol under visible light irradiation.213 However, a pure TiOF2 photocatalyst exhibits several issues such as poor thermal stability, poor visible light adsorption, non-ideal chemical resistance and so on.170 Thus, the development of a new photocatalyst, i.e. anatase TiO2, by employing TiOF2 as a solid precursor has the capability of overcoming the aforementioned drawbacks, which was successfully demonstrated by several groups.168,212 TiOF2 possesses a cubic structure with a lattice constant of a = 3.798 Å, which is very similar to the crystal lattice along the a- or b-axis of tetragonal anatase TiO2 (lattice constant: a = b = 3.785 Å). The close correlation of the crystal structures and the phase transformation between TiOF2 to anatase TiO2 make TiOF2 an ideal template for the fabrication of 3D TiO2 superstructures via the topotactic transformation process. In addition, the presence of fluoride ions in TiOF2 would also be beneficial for stabilizing the high energy {001} facets during the crystal growth process.
Wang and co-workers demonstrated the preparation of 3D hierarchical TiO2 nanoboxes using TiOF2 as the solid precursor via a template-engaged topotactic transformation process.212 In a typical synthesis, TiOF2 nanocubes were dispersed in NaOH solution and were kept at 80 °C for 8 h for the transformation process. The as-prepared box-like hierarchical structures were enclosed by six ordered arranged TiO2 nanorod arrays consisting of {001}-oriented anatase TiO2 nanorods. Fig. 16a–d show the SEM images of the samples at different reaction times. At the initial stage of the reaction, TiO2 nanoparticles were formed on the surface of TiOF2 through the following reaction: TiOF2 + 2OH− → TiO2 + H2O + F−(15)

Owing to the hard self-template restriction, a cubic shell consisting of TiO2 nanoparticles with the same shape as TiOF2 was produced. As the reaction time progresses, the TiO2 shells grew thicker at the expense of TiOF2. In time, the TiOF2 precursor was completely consumed, resulting in a phase pure TiO2 nanobox. A schematic illustrating the entire process is depicted in Fig. 16e. Furthermore, the enrichment of OH− in the reaction system effectively lowered the surface energy, hence leading to the formation of {001}-oriented TiO2 nanorods.212
The roles of growth conditions such as pH values have important effects on the morphologies and topotactic transformation process from TiOF2 to anatase TiO2.168 The morphologies of the TiO2 samples are greatly dependent on the pH values of the precursor solutions, which are caused by the pH-induced changes of surface fluoride ions and hydroxyl groups. It has been reported that the topotactic transformation from TiOF2 to TiO2 can only take place at pH ranging from 2–11.168 At these pH values, TiOF2 can react with H2O (acidic condition) or OH− (basic condition) to form TiO2 according to eqn (16) and (17), respectively. At pH values above 12, TiOF2 would react with NaOH instead of water due to higher hydroxyl concentration. This would result in the formation of amorphous Na2Ti3O7 (eqn (18)), which is similar to the alkali thermal process for fabricating protonated titanates and TiO2 nanotubes.214 On the other hand, the reaction temperature was found to have little effect on the morphologies of the TiO2 nanoboxes. However, it can increase the topotactic transformation speed as well as affect the crystallinity and sizes of the samples.168 H2O + TiOF2 → TiO2 + 2HF(16) 2OH− + TiOF2 → TiO2 + H2O + 2F−(17) 8NaOH + 3TiOF2 → Na2Ti3O7 + 6NaF + 4H2O(18)
Using a similar strategy, unique hollow TiO2 boxes with a high percentage of reactive {001} facets were successfully prepared by Xie and co-workers.76 The authors proposed that the process started off with an initial decomposition process at the surface of the TiOF2 cubes. Fig. 17 illustrates the formation process from cubic TiOF2 to hollow TiO2 boxes. The generated TiO2 was first shaped into plates due to the hard self-template restriction. Further decomposition of TiOF2 cubes then resulted in the formation of hollow boxes enclosed with six nanoplates. In addition, the adsorption of fluoride ions on the surface of the samples stabilized the high energy {001} facets, thus resulting in hollow TiO2 boxes with dominant {001} facets.

In contrast to the preparation of anatase TiO2 with predominantly exposed {001} and {101} facets, Wu and co-workers demonstrated the synthesis of cuboid-shaped anatase TiO2 single crystals bound by {001} and {100} facets using HCl as a synergistic capping agent together with HF.169 Based on DFT calculations, it was found that there was a preferred replacement of HCl with HF at {100} and its favourable adsorption provided a special stabilization effect on the formation of anatase TiO2 enclosed by {001} and {100} facets. Fig. 18 shows the Wulff construction plots of the anatase TiO2 crystals. It can be observed that TiO2 crystals covered by either pure HCl or HF gave rise to similar bipyramidal morphologies, just with a different ratio of {001} with respect to the {101} facet. On the other hand, HF-covered {100}/{001} and HCl-covered {101} resulted in a cubic shaped anatase TiO2 crystal. This finding effectively demonstrated that the shape-controlled synthesis of anatase TiO2 single crystals is achievable through the synergistic effect of hydrohalic acids.169

2.1.2. Strategies excluding the direct utilization of HF. 
Despite the aforementioned abundant literature which has been discussed in Section 2.1.1 on the synthesis of {001} faceted-TiO2, there are several drawbacks such as the use of extremely toxic, corrosive and environmentally unfriendly HF. Therefore, a number of researchers have been recently devoted to explore safer and more environmentally friendly capping agents to substitute HF for a comparatively green strategy for producing TiO2 facets with easy control over the morphology.100,215,216 To name a few, TiF4,217 NH4F,165 (NH4)2TiF6,132 ionic liquid 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate149 and so forth. The reaction mechanism for the formation of faceted TiO2 particles using different Ti precursors and capping agents will be discussed to systematically analyze the structures and morphologies. Having the fundamental knowledge on the growth procedures, the controlled synthesis of highly uniform nano-sized TiO2 nanocrystals with dominant {001} facets and a relatively narrow size distribution will no longer be a strenuous task to achieve.
2.1.2.1. Titanium(IV) fluoride (TiF4). 
Anatase TiO2 microspheres have been developed by interconnecting and joining square TiO2 sheets during the crystal growth stage. Very recently, Miao and Liu217 reported a facile hydrothermal method for synthesizing anatase TiO2 microspheres with a high percentage (>90%) of exposed reactive {001} facets using TiF4 as a capping and stabilizing agent without introducing any additional direct HF. During the crystal growth process, the surfaces of the microspheres were closely covered with interconnected square nanoflakes of exposed {001} facets to develop a mosaic structure. They claimed that increasing the reaction duration not only increased the size of TiO2 microspheres, but also modified the crystal terminating surface from round to square faceted as shown in Fig. 19a–f. The reaction mechanism for such a surface transformation could be rationalized as follows: TiF4 began to hydrolyze and the concentration of F− in the solution was low. Most of the F− ions appeared as complexes with titanium such as TiF3(OH), TiF2(OH)2 and TiF(OH)3. When the F− concentration increased, more F− ions could be adsorbed on the TiO2 {001} facets, leading to a reduction in the surface energy of the (001) planes. Therefore, this passivation slowed down the growth rate of {001} facets with respect to other planes, which eventually grew themselves out of existence. Moreover, they observed some eroded holes on the outer nanoflake surfaces after 4 h of hydrothermal reaction (Fig. 19g and h), which might be formed by the excessive use of TiF4.

Reaction duration: (a) 1 h, (b) 1.25 h, (c) 1.5 h, (d) 1.75 h, (e) 2 h, (f) 3 h, (g) 4 h and (h) 4.5 h. Reprinted with permission from ref. 217. Copyright 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry. 
Another group of researchers has also developed anatase TiO2 nanosheet-based hierarchical spheres (ATNHSs) with dominantly exposed {001} facets (>90%) via a diethylene glycol-solvothermal route.84 They have successfully synthesized 3D hierarchitectures self-assembled with sheet-like anatase TiO2 {001} facets as building blocks. They inferred that the nanosheet-like architectures could effectively reduce the grain interface effect and decrease the electron loss for the enhancement in the overall energy conversion efficiency in the DSSC system. Such a morphology has also been achieved by Miao and Liu217 with >90% exposed reactive {001} facets recently. Besides the minimization of the grain interface effect, the great improvement in the energy conversion efficiency was attributed to other outstanding features: (1) the exposed {001} facets gave rise to strong ability to dissociatively adsorb the COOH group.218–220 This process would increase the electronic coupling between the sensitizer and TiO2, favoring electron injection from the excited state of the sensitizer to the conduction band (CB) of TiO2.221 (2) High surface area of ATNHSs would increase the dye loading. (3) Finally, submicrometre-sized TiO2 spheres promoted the light harvesting of the dye within the photoanodes.
Besides that, Ma et al.152 fabricated uniform anatase TiO2 particles with multi-twinned {001} facets comprised of highly truncated pyramids by employing TiF4 and disodium ethylene diamine tetraacetate (EDTA) as the starting materials. Both TiF4 and chelating agent EDTA played a key role as synergistic capping agents in stabilizing {001} facets. It was speculated that ETDA4− could form very stable complexes as [TiO(EDTA)]2− in the reaction environment of pH value close to 7.0. Due to a higher density of under-coordinated Ti5c on the {001} surface than that on the {101} surface, EDTA4− could preferentially adsorb on the {001} facets. Thus, this would be the core steps for the nucleation and crystal growth of TiO2 with dominant {001} facets.
Apart from that, deposition of oriented anatase TiO2 films with the highly reactive {001} facets on a transparent conductive substrate has been realized. Liu and Aydil104 employed a facile hydrothermal method for growing polycrystalline anatase TiO2 films with oriented {001} facets based on hydrolysis and condensation of TiF4 on transparent conductive fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO). The authors claimed that FTO was very stable unlike other substrates such as silicon, indium tin oxide (ITO) and glass, which easily resulted in the detachment of the TiO2 film from the surface after its formation. The TiO2 nanocrystals with {001} facets that made up the film were homogeneous, continuous and strongly adhered onto the FTO substrate even after prolonged ultrasonication or during the adhesive tape test. Stabilization of high energy {001} surfaces was achieved by capping this surface with TiF4. Evidently, the (004) diffraction peak was substantially enhanced and other diffraction peaks including the (101), (200) and (211) diffractions were completely absent based on the XRD results. Therefore, it is worth noticing that dominance of the (001) planes contributes to the enhancement in the (004) diffraction.
On the other hand, water-based synthesis strategies by hydrothermal treatment for the formation of TiO2 usually display irregular shapes and relatively wide size distribution as a result of the rapid nucleation of TiO2 and the fast crystal growth rate during hydrolysis and condensation processes.154 Such a limitation will certainly limit the practical applications especially in photocatalysis considering that the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 depends on not only the ratio of exposed {001} facets, but also the surface area and morphology. Zhu et al.154 employed a new non-hydrolytic approach to synthesize TiO2 nanocrystals with dominant {001} facets by solvothermal alcoholysis of TiF4 in either single alcohol or binary alcohol. This approach was relatively less toxic than the traditional hydrolysis route because the direct use of HF could be avoided and less F− species released from the alcoholysis of TiF4 due to the formation of organofluoride (R–F) as evidenced by the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrum. In this method, alcohols such as tert-butanol served as an oxygen donating agent to form TiO2via the formation of stable carbon cations as shown in Fig. 20. The non-hydrolytic route provided an amiable environment for the effective control of the Ti–O–Ti bond formation. At the same time, tert-butanol could adsorb on the {001} facets and stabilize the adsorption of F− species on the {001} surfaces. The synergistic effects of adsorbed alcohols and F− could effectively retard the crystal growth along the [001] direction, leading to the truncation of the octahedron to the decahedron with dominant {001} facets. Thus, the smooth alcoholysis of TiF4 and crystal growth of TiO2 allowed controllable synthesis of TiO2 decahedral nanocrystals leading to uniform shapes and particle sizes.

In the past few decades, nonaqueous surfactant-assisted synthesis methods have revolutionized the production of highly monodisperse and shape-controlled nanocrystals,222,223 enabling the production of model systems for catalysis with near atomic precision in size and control over faceting.224–227 Gordon et al.129 reported the controlled synthesis of highly uniform TiO2 nanocrystals ranging from 10 to 100 nm which were prepared through a nonaqueous seeded growth technique. Similar to that reported by other researchers,217,228 the titanium precursor TiF4 served as a structure directing agent to allow better morphological control compared to that previously obtained by the traditional hydrothermal process with the direct use of hazardous HF. Also, they demonstrated that the choice of titanium precursor and surfactant could markedly engineer the tetragonal bipyramidal anatase TiO2 with various percentages of {001} and {101} facets. Surprisingly, the faceted TiO2 nanocrystals synthesized in the presence of TiF4 were found to exhibit blue coloration and displayed broad visible/NIR absorbance which peaks in the infra-red region (λmax ≈ 3400 nm). The blue color resulting from oxygen vacancies formed on the TiO2 surface was indicated by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) studies.
2.1.2.2. Ammonium fluoride (NH4F) and ammonium bifluoride (NH4HF2). 
Although TiF4 or HF seems inevitable for all the current available approaches in the tailored synthesis of well-faceted single crystals of anatase TiO2 and the maximal size is about 2 μm as discussed earlier in Sections 2.1.1 and 2.1.2.1, a size and shape controllable synthesis without the use of expensive TiF4 and extremely corrosive HF is highly desirable. Material design based on topochemical conversion is an effective and targeted strategy for the preparation of a unique structure, even selective exposure of a specific facet. Recently, it has been reported that other fluorine precursors such as NH4F,134 NaBF4,9 NaF,9 (NH4)2TiF6 (ref. 229) and ionic liquid (1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate)128 could be used as a substitute to replace TiF4 and HF. Feng et al.134 conducted a facile synthesis of size tunable anatase TiO2 sheets with exposed {001} facets via a simple one-step self-assembly and self-etching surfactant-free solvothermal process. They used titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4) as the Ti source due to its low cost and also NH4F as the capping agent which was more tractable than HF, thus avoiding the danger of cauterization of HF. The molar ratio of Ti to NH4F was found to be 1:4. NH4F played a trio-role in the reaction: (1) the F− and NH4+ a source of intermediate product of NH4TiOF3, (2) the capping agent adsorbed on the {001} facets, and (3) the F− as the self-etching agent instantaneously produced in the system. They pointed out that smaller TiO2 nanosheets could be fabricated by substituting ethanol with 2-propanol, which behaved as a synergistic capping agent. At the early stage of the solvothermal process, several aggregates of small particles with irregular shapes and also some sheet-like particles were observed. When the solvothermal duration increased from 0 h to 24 h, a uniform well-faceted sheet-shaped foursquare morphology was achieved. It is interesting to note that during the topochemical conversion from NH4TiOF3 to TiO2, some shrinkage voids exist in broken sheets which were formed due to the crystal structural differences, causing NH4+ and F− ions to be trapped.
Furthermore, the surface structure of TiO2 has been extensively explored at the atomic level. Lately, hollow microspherical assemblies comprising anatase TiO2 nanosheets with dominant {001} facets have been successfully synthesized by Liu et al.194 Hollow TiO2 microspheres (HTS) composed of anatase polyhedra with ca. 20% exposed {001} facets were produced by using a modified fluoride-mediated self-transformation strategy. In this scenario, NH4F and ethanol were selected to promote the stabilization of {001} facets of anatase polyhedra acting as the building blocks for the HTS formation. The SEM image of a few microspheres indicated that they were composed of primary nanoparticles which made their surface rough and porous for enhanced photocatalytic activity. This opens new avenues for the design of advanced photocatalysts with desirable catalytic selectivity beyond stability.
A similar morphology was also achieved by Yu et al.155 They employed ammonium bifluoride (NH4HF2) as a stabilizing and morphology-controlling agent and successfully synthesized surface-fluorinated TiO2 hollow microspheres and tabular-shaped anatase single crystals in micro size exposed with highly energetic {001} facets via a one-step hydrothermal route. They found that by varying the molar ratio of fluorine to titanium (RF), the morphology, crystallinity, crystal size and porosity could be controlled. Significantly, with increasing RF, well-defined tabular-shaped anatase TiO2 microcrystals were fabricated via Ostwald ripening and preferential adsorption of F− onto the {001} facets. Fig. 21 illustrates the structures of the TiO2 crystals with varying RF from solid microspheres in the absence of fluoride to hollow microspheres and eventually to well-crystallized TiO2 with exposed {001} facets. The chemical reactions (eqn (19)–(21)) could be demonstrated as follows: NH4HF2 → NH4F + HF(19) 4H+ + TiO2 + 6F− → TiF62− + 2H2O(20) TiF62− + 2H2O → 4H+ + TiO2 + 6F−(21)

Moreover, it has been reported that the removal of the surface adsorbed F atoms could be attained by heating the faceted TiO2 at certain temperatures.8,158 As a result, the {001} facet-dominated TiO2 sheets will cohere with each other leading to the elimination of {001} facets due to their unstable property and the formation of more favorable {101} facets as the dominant surface. Therefore, the F atoms on the surface would be replaced by the hydroxyl groups. To overcome the problem, Wang et al.165 have systematically studied the thermal stability and crystal facet growth behavior of anatase TiO2 nanosheets with exposed high reactive {001} facets by heating the mixture of TiO2 and NH4F. The results implied that anatase TiO2 nanosheets grew into {001} facet-dominated anatase TiO2 microsheets via surface fusion along the [001] crystallographic direction by introducing gaseous HF as the capping agent as depicted in Fig. 22. A similar phenomenon was also observed by Yang et al.159 (see Section 2.1.1.1), where the stacking of TiO2 sheets occurred during the hydrothermal treatment in deionized water. This surface fusion phenomenon was due to the fact that the {001} facet was full of unstable and uncoordinated Ti5c atoms. Therefore, during the crystal growth process, they were inclined to produce Ti6c atoms through surface diffusion. This is pretty similar to the role of HF played in the conventional well-known hydrothermal system.147,148,159,163 More importantly, they reported that a suitable amount of NH4F resulted in the formation of highly reactive N-doped anatase TiO2 sheets with few defects and few Ti–F groups, which were favorable for photocatalysis.

2.1.2.3. Sodium fluoroborate (NaBF4) and sodium fluoride (NaF). 
In addition to NH4F as the capping agent, Lai et al.9 adopted a facile and innoxious hydrothermal approach for the controllable synthesis of anatase TiO2 wholly exposed {001} and {100} facets under a reaction temperature as low as 100 °C. It is considered the lowest reaction temperature so far to be applied in the synthesis of well-defined faceted anatase TiO2. Without doubt, it is much lower than those utilized in the former methods, which commonly require a high reaction temperature above 180 °C.147,159,200,230 This process was claimed to be less toxic considering that NaBF4 and NaF were used as the facet control agents instead of HF. HCl, on the other hand, was used as a hydrolysis inhibitor to control the size of the as-prepared faceted anatase TiO2.
Notably, by adjusting the reaction conditions such as reaction temperature, concentration of F− ions and concentration of H+ ions, the lowest energy {101} facets could be completely eliminated and also micro-sized and nano-sized anatase TiO2 with different percentages of {001} and {100} facets could be easily controlled. The detailed morphology evolution of nano-sized anatase TiO2 with high energy facets is illustrated in Fig. 23a and b. They also conducted XPS and DFT calculations to thoroughly study the formation mechanism of faceted TiO2. Based on the DFT calculations, the Ti–F–Ti species played a prominent role in lowering the {001} and {100} facets of TiO2. Furthermore, the results confirmed that the reactions of the –OH groups on the surface of TiO2, which were replaced by F atoms, were really exothermic and could eventually lower the surface energy of {001} and {100} facets. Owing to this reason, TiO2 with high energy facets could be fabricated at a low reaction temperature of 100 °C in the presence of surface lattice F, which means partial surface lattice oxygen atoms are substituted by F atoms. This surface lattice F resulted in the disappearance of the lowest surface energy {101} facets. Evidently, DFT results revealed that the surface energy of {101} facets became the highest after the formation of surface lattice F and the stabilities of {001}, {100} and {101} facets containing the surface Ti–F–Ti species were ranked in the order of {101} < {100} < {001} as shown in Fig. 23e. The optimized structures of {101}, {100} and {001} surfaces with their corresponding surface energies are indicated in Fig. 23c–e.

2.1.2.4. Ammonium hexafluorotitanate ((NH4)2TiF6). 
The synthesis of layered TiO2 composed of anatase nanosheets with exposed {001} facets by a simple hydrothermal method in the presence of (NH4)2TiF6, H3BO3 and 2-propanol (PrOH) followed by calcination treatment under air flow was successfully demonstrated by Yu et al.229 To understand the thermal conversion process for the formation of layered TiO2, they have performed thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA). The results indicated that the conversion process from NH4TiOF3 to anatase TiO2 was composed of four sequential steps: NH4TiOF3 → HTiOF3 (by removal of NH3) → TiOF2 (by removal of HF) → TiO2. It is noted that under weak acidic conditions, PrOH dissociated heterolytically into PrO−. Both BF4− and PrO− can preferentially bind to unsaturated Ti4+ cations on the {001} facets of the NH4TiOF3 nucleus, decreasing the surface energy of the {001} facets and thus restraining the growth along the [001] direction. It is worth noting that faster growth along [101] and [100] directions would lead to the formation of single crystal nanosheets with dominant {001} facets. Subsequently, NH4TiOF3 nanosheets with {001} facets, capped with PrO− and BF4−, interacted with each other and orderly assembled to block tabular grains. Upon calcination treatment, NH4TiOF3 nanosheets would transform into TiO2 nanosheets by oriented self-assembly. The schematic illustration for the formation of layered TiO2 is presented in Fig. 24.

Besides the intriguing layered TiO2 structures composed of anatase nanosheets, high aspect ratios of TiO2 nanotubular layers have received much attention owing to their special structures, outstanding mechanical and electrical properties and most importantly, enhanced photoreactivtiy. Wang et al.153 synthesized TiO2 tubular materials composed of microcrystallites with a high percentage of reactive {001} facets by using ZrO2 fibers as a template. In this way, TiO2 nanoparticles were deposited and grown on the ZrO2 fibers, whereas the ZrO2 fibers were gradually corroded as the reaction time increased. This could be explained in terms of two chemical reactions as shown in eqn (22) and (23). Based on the SEM images of the as-synthesized TiO2 tubular structures at various reaction durations t (Fig. 25), the authors provided a plausible growth mechanism. At t = 1 h, a dense layer of TiO2 nanocrystals was randomly deposited on the smooth surface of ZrO2 fibers. At t = 6 h, the TiO2 layer grew thicker and ZrO2 templates started to corrode. When t reached 24 h, the ZrO2 templates were completely corroded away and the structure was only left with TiO2 tubular materials. Therefore, this process provides a facile method to produce TiO2 with special structures which may have promising applications in photocatalysis. (NH4)2TiF6 + 2H2O → TiO2 + 2NH4F + 4HF(22) ZrO2 + 4HF + 2NH4F → (NH4)2ZrF6 + 2H2O(23)

Very recently, Ye et al.132 synthesized anatase TiO2 crystals with {101}–{001} and {010}–{001} two facets coexistence using (NH4)2TiF6 as the titanium and fluorine species. In the paper, four different anatase TiO2 samples were prepared, namely 101/001-1 (49% {001} and 51% {101}), 101/001-2 (70% {001} and 30% {101}), 010/001-1 (48% {001} and 52% {010}) and 010/001-2 (64% {001} and 36% {010}). Fig. 26a shows the XRD patterns of all four samples. The formation of pure anatase TiO2 with tetragonal structures was confirmed by the characteristic peaks located at 25.4° (101), 37.8° (004), 48.5° (200), 54.0° (105), 55.4° (211) and 62.9° (204). XRD was also utilized to confirm the amount of {010} facets present in the samples. It can be seen that the intensities of the (010) peak and I010/I101 increased in the order of 010/001-1 > 010/001-2 > 101/001-2 > 101/001-1. For 101/001-1, 101/001-2, 010/001-1 and 010/001-2, and the volume ratio of HCl to water and hydrothermal temperature were 10/20 and 180 °C, 15/15 and 180 °C, 10/20 and 150 °C and 15/15 and 150 °C, respectively. In addition to XRD characterization, Tian's group131 recently introduced a novel approach to quantitatively measure the percentage of exposed {001} facets in anatase TiO2 using Raman spectroscopy. Based on experimental and theoretical analyses, the authors found that the percentage of {001} facets had a clear relationship with the peak intensity ratio of the Raman vibrational mode Eg peak and A1g peaks. Furthermore, Raman spectroscopy was reported to provide high sensitivity and accuracy for the measurements from the micro-perspective of molecular bonding with less measurement errors. Fig. 26b shows the Raman spectra of the TiO2 samples in Ye et al.'s work.132 By simply measuring the intensity ratio of A1g and Eg peaks, the {001} facet percentages of 101/001-1, 101/001-2, 010/001-1 and 010/001-2 were evaluated to be 49%, 70%, 48% and 64%, respectively. Photocatalytic measurements revealed that photoinduced charge transfer properties between {101} and {001} facets resulted in an efficient separation of charges. However, by replacing {101} with {010}, the charge transfer mechanism was altered and the photogenerated electron–hole pairs could not separate well, leading to inhibition of photocatalytic activities.132

2.1.2.5. Ionic liquids (1-methyl-imidazolium tetrafluoroborate and 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluroborate). 
In addition to conventional hydrothermal or solvothermal treatment as elaborated in Sections 2.1.2.1–2.1.2.4, microwave-assisted methods have been recently employed for the synthesis of TiO2 with well-defined {001} facets using ionic liquids (in particular) as the reaction medium.103,127,128,228 The conventional thermal treatment methods are not energy-efficient due to the long reaction time involved.103 Furthermore, the microwave heating process is fast, simple and the reaction can be conducted under atmospheric pressure in a domestic microwave oven.128 More importantly, the primary advantage of utilizing an effective microwave irradiation system is its ability to heat the reactants to high temperature uniformly and rapidly and thereby the size of nanocrystals could be easily controlled with fewer Ti3+ defects and no aggregation.128,231 This undoubtedly implies that the microwave-assisted process appears to play an indispensable role in the morphology control of homogeneous TiO2 nanostructures.
Lately, ionic liquids have been widely studied as a new kind of environmentally benign solvent due to their unique characteristics such as nonvolatile, nonflammable, a wide temperature range, good thermal stability, good dissolving ability, high ionic conductivity, designable structures and excellent microwave absorbing ability.232–236 Ionic liquids coupled with the microwave irradiation system will certainly present obvious merits on the environmental arena. In comparison to the systems which use HF as the source of capping agent, the anion of the ionic liquid, 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate, [BF4]− with four fluorine atoms creates a rich and dense fluorine environment on the crystal surface and thus stabilizes the {001} facets. Evidently, the more bulky [BF4]− groups protect and stabilize the {001} surfaces as compared to the HF system as depicted in Fig. 27.

Using TiF4 and ionic liquid, 1-methyl-imidazolium tetrafluoroborate, as starting materials, Zhang et al.127 successfully synthesized anatase TiO2 single crystals with a truncated tetragonal bipyramidal shape by employing the microwave-assisted method for a duration of 90 min. By simply varying the concentration of 1-methyl-imidazolium tetrafluoroborate, the percentage of reactive {001} facets was continuously tuned from 27% to 50%. Such a fluorated surface, resulting from the F-riched molecule (1-methyl-imidazolium tetrafluoroborate), can significantly lower the surface energy of {001} facets owing to the high binding energy of F–Ti (569.0 kJ mol−1) making them more stable than the {101} surfaces. In the absence of the ionic liquid, only hollow TiO2 nanospheres were obtained signifying the importance of the F-rich environment on the stabilization of {001} facets. Zhang et al.127 thoroughly described the formation mechanism of {001} facet-exposed TiO2 in aqueous solution by microwave irradiation as shown in Fig. 28a. In the range of microwave frequency, polar molecules such as H2O orientate with the electric field. When dipolar molecules reorientate with respect to an alternating electric field, energy is dissipated in the form of heat by molecular friction. Considering that water has high dielectric losses, it is an ideal solvent for microwave rapid heating. The ionic liquid, 1-methyl-imidazolium tetrafluoroborate, in this reaction medium would then exhibit a synergistic effect to absorb the microwaves for the efficient synthesis of anatase TiO2 with {001} facets. Such a uniform size and shape of the TiO2 nanocrystal was attributed to the rapid and uniform heating of the reagent and solvent in a microwave irradiation system. Rapid heating accelerated the hydrolysis of TiF4 for the release of F− ions to protect and adsorb the {001} facets and also nucleation of anatase TiO2 clusters. As a result of homogeneous microwave heating, high quality anatase {001}-faceted TiO2 with a narrow size distribution and improved crystallinity were formed. Similar results were also reported by Zhang et al.103 who utilized 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium [bmim]+ tetrafluoroborate as another form of ionic liquids, elucidating the essential role of ionic liquids as a key determinant to form {001} facet-exposed anatase TiO2 crystals.

In another paper, Ding et al.128 reported a facile method to synthesize anatase TiO2 nanocrystals with controlled size and shape via a microwave-assisted route in ionic liquids. They used titanium isopropoxide (TTIP) as the Ti precursor and 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate as the ionic liquid, which are used as the starting materials. TEM images revealed that most of the nanocrystals displayed a bipyramidal shape with truncated {001} facets. Negligible Ti3+ defect was observed in the nanocrystals as evidenced by the absence of photoluminescence (PL) peak detected between 600 and 800 nm. Based on the partial charge model theory and their experimental results, they proposed a possible formation mechanism of {001}-faceted TiO2. TTIP was hydrolyzed by a small amount of water in the ionic liquid, 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate, and then condensed into short chain polyanions protected by [bmim]+ cations at the early stage of the reaction process. Followed by rapid growth and cross-linking of these polyanions due to the increasing reaction temperature, anatase TiO2 nanocrystals with exposed {001} facets were formed within several minutes. In this method, the ionic liquid played multiple roles: (1) as a reaction medium (solvent), (2) as a microwave absorbent, and (3) as a protecting agent for the intermediates resulting in uniform size and shape of anatase TiO2 with {001} facets. All in all, the enhanced crystallinity of anatase TiO2 in the presence of an ionic liquid is beneficial for promoting the high percentage of {001} facets. Besides achieving dominant {001} facets, improved crystallization has been evidenced to reduce the number of defects in the nanocrystals which is advantageous for the photocatalytic enhancement.

2.2. Strategies involving fluorine-free containing species
It is well-known that most of the reported methods as described in Section 2.1 utilized HF or other F-containing species as capping agents to control the morphology of anatase TiO2 nanoparticles with the aim of achieving a large percentage of reactive {001} facets. However, it is undeniable that these F-containing compounds especially HF will generate unexpected toxic and corrosive substances at elevated temperature.100 Furthermore, removal of F− ions from the crystal surface is difficult due to the passivation of F− ions on the crystal planes.84 Owing to the above-mentioned limitations, it is highly desirable to develop a novel synthesis methodology with fluorine-free chemicals as the capping agent. Here comes the question: can anatase TiO2 nanocrystals exposed with dominant {001} facets grow in an absolute fluorine-free environment? The answer is yes. To date, there are a few papers reported on fluorine-free strategies for fabricating anatase TiO2 with a remarkable amount of high energy {001} facets leading to significant breakthroughs in the rational design for practical applications in many fields of science and technology.87,137,237,238
Mesoporous anatase TiO2 spheres (MATS) with surface covered with sole {001} facets were successfully synthesized by Zhao et al.239 by using a simple and fluorine-free hydrothermal method. They found that H2SO4 acted as both a phase inducer for the anatase phase and a capping agent which effectively stabilized only {001} facets leading to high coverage of {001} facets on the sphere surface. They also studied the formation process of MATS in the H2SO4 solution at various reaction durations. At the initial stage of the reaction (within 1 h), the crystalline structure was not fully developed despite the appearance of the anatase phase (Fig. 29a). Highly crystalline structures could be seen after 3 h, which were confirmed by SEM images based on the formation of well-defined rectangular nanoplates on the surface of MATS (Fig. 29b and c). The overall crystal structures continued to refine until 24 h (Fig. 29d). Furthermore, based on the XRD data, the TiO2 crystal size grew rapidly within 15 h. Beyond 20 h, the crystal growth rate leveled off, suggesting that the growth rate of TiO2 crystals was very slow or stopped. The oriented growth of {001} facets induced by H2SO4 resulted in a mesoporous crystalline framework with high surface areas. More importantly, considering that the interaction between H2SO4 and {001} facets was fairly weak, the capping agent H2SO4 could be easily removed by simple washing which was technically advantageous for photocatalytic applications.

Typically, in aqueous systems, the use of titanium alkoxide precursors in a low concentration has become a broadly known experimental condition to avoid nanocrystals from agglomeration and further growth, which makes it challenging to achieve high quality of TiO2 nanocrystals in a bulk quantity.136,240 As a result, much research effort has been recently directed to the development of non-hydrolytic synthesis approaches which could also yield TiO2 with dominant {001} facets. Shan and Demopoulos240 prepared aqueous well-dispersed and phase-pure anatase TiO2 truncated octahedron nanoplatelets with the size of 20–40 nm via controlled hydrolysis of TiCl4 in ethylene glycol. Partial decomposition of ethylene glycol produced water in situ (eqn (24)) for hydrolysis of TiCl4 and aldehydes or its derivatives to control the morphology of TiO2 by the polymerization/condensation process through the formation of titanium oxy/hydroxychloride complexes ([Ti(OH)xCln]4−(n+x) or [TiOyCln]4−(n+2y)) (eqn (25)). Interestingly, peptization and morphology control of reactive TiO2 facets occurred simultaneously without introducing any extra additives via the production of HCl by the hydrolysis reaction and also the action of aldehydes and other ethylene glycol decomposition products. The reaction mechanism is summarized as follows: HOCH2CH2OH ⇌ CH3CHO + H2O(24) TiCl4 + 2H2O → [Ti(OH)xCln]4−(n+x)] or [TiOyCln]4−(n+2y) → TiO2 + 4HCl(25)
Besides that, amine-mediated methods have been recently reported for the successful development of TiO2 nanocrystals with highly exposed {001} facets. Generally, amines have dual functions namely a bridging ligand to facilitate the formation of the Ti–O–Ti skeleton in a particular direction and also a capping agent to inhibit the formation of the Ti–O–Ti skeleton three dimensionally.138 Chen et al.87 proved that diethylenetriamine (DETA) in 2-propanol could serve as a substitute crystallographic controlling agent to fluorine species for stabilizing high energy {001} facets in the solvothermal system. Post-calcination at 400 °C for 2 h resulted in high crystallinity of the anatase phase without any changes in morphology. The as-synthesized TiO2 hierarchical spheres assembled from ultrathin {001} facet nanosheets (∼3 nm in thickness and a few hundred nm in lateral size) were claimed to possess nearly 100% exposed {001} facets.
In addition, Roy et al.138 studied the fine control of different facets of cuboid TiO2 nanocrystals by varying the reaction duration using DEA and tetrabutylammonium hydroxide (TBAH) as a fluorine-free shape-controlling reagent and a bridging ligand, respectively. In recent years, the key focus has been on increasing the surface area of exposed high energy {001} facets to improve the photocatalytic activity. However, they implied that not only more reactive {001} and {100} facets, but also the presence of less reactive {101} facets were essential to contribute to the improved photocatalysis as a result of the preferential charge carrier transport to specific facets of TiO2 nanocrystals to reduce the charge recombination. The TEM images revealed that the particle size distribution varied from smaller to larger with an increase in the reaction duration of the hydrothermal synthesis (Fig. 30g). As observed in Fig. 30a–f, TiO2 nanocrystals with sharp edges and corners were obtained with a reaction duration of 12 h. However, the edges of TiO2 were found to be flattened with increasing reaction duration. Evidently, ellipsoid and distorted cuboid TiO2 crystals were achieved in 72 h of reaction (Fig. 30f). They highlighted that DEA can easily stabilize the {001} facets of TiO2 exclusively through hydrogen bonding (Fig. 30h) showing that the distance between amine-H and hydroxyl-H (0.46 nm) was closer to the distance between two consecutive O2c atoms of {001} facets (0.53 nm) as compared to the distance between two consecutive O2c atoms of {101} facets (0.28 nm) on the TiO2 surface. To compare the morphology of DEA-capped with the traditional HF-capped TiO2 crystals as discussed in Section 2.1.1, the size of the present DEA-capped TiO2 crystals was reported to be ranging from 30–170 nm. In comparison to the HF-capped TiO2 crystals, a size range of 1–3 μm was attained for truncated tetragonal bipyramidal whereas the nanosheets were in the range of 10–1000 nm in length and 3–260 nm in thickness. This shows that a much narrower size distribution and a smaller particle size could be achieved with the use of DEA as an efficient capping agent. This could be probably ascribed to the fast hydrolysis of the titanium precursor in the HF environment leading to a larger particle size relative to the smoother hydrolysis in an amine-mediated (DEA) environment.

In another paper, Dinh et al.136 have developed a versatile synthesis method based on the solvothermal technique for the design of TiO2 nanocrystals with various shapes such as rhombic, truncated rhombic, spherical, dog-bone, truncated and elongated rhombic and bar by employing both OA and OM as two distinct capping surfactants in the presence of water vapor as the hydrolysis agent. It is documented that both OA and OM have different binding strengths to control the growth of the TiO2 nanoparticles. Specifically, OA binds strongly to the {001} facets of TiO2, whereas OM adheres well on the {101} surfaces, governing the final shape of TiO2 nanoparticles. By increasing the amount of OA, anatase TiO2 with {001} facets could be preserved (Fig. 31a). Similar observations were also reported by Wu et al.137 and D'Arienzo et al.65 using OA and OM as capping agents. It is assumed that TBOT first reacted with water vapor which was generated at elevated temperature to produce unstable hydroxyalkoxide species via a hydrolysis process. This precursor was then reacted with OA to form carboxyalkoxides or with other hydroalkoxides through the hydrolytic condensation process. The formation of carboxyalkoxides is of key importance which determines the shape evolution of TiO2 crystals since the existence of the carboxylic chain could efficiently hinder the attack of water at the metal centers, and thus limiting the hydrolytic condensation process. To elucidate the effect of water content on the morphology of crystals, the authors exemplified that, with a large amount of water in the reaction system, TBOT reacted vigorously with water through the hydrolytic process resulting in the aggregation of the TiO2 particles (Fig. 31b), whereas in the absence of water, the formation of TiO2 underwent slow nonhydrolytic reaction, producing nanodots or nanorods (Fig. 31c). All in all, the presence of an appropriate amount of water vapor along with the desired molar ratio of OA to OM plays a crucial role in controlling the final size and shape of TiO2 nanocrystals.

By and large, it is well-known that selecting a suitable titanium precursor with a suitable transformation process is essential because it can directly affect the phases, sizes, shapes and exposed facets of TiO2.241–244 Although titanium alkoxides and TiCl4 are extensively used as titanium precursors for both fluorine and fluorine-free processes as summarized in Table 1, they exhibit high reactivity leading to a mixture of various polymeric species.56 To overcome the problem, alcohol, surfactants or chelating agents namely dihydric alcohol, 2-propanol, OA, OM or carboxylic acid are used to control the hydrolysis rate of the titanium precursors.245,246 However, the obtained TiO2 seldom exhibits specific facets and also the evaporation of organic molecules would impose environmental contamination.247 As a result, a new titanium precursor to selectively synthesize TiO2 with tunable shapes and exposed specific facets as well as producing minimal environmental pollution is highly necessary. TiO2 nanofibers derived from the alkali treatment of TiO2 nanoparticles under highly basic conditions have been considered by several researchers as a potential precursor for preparing TiO2 with high energy surfaces with the assistance of capping agents.80,215 For example, Li et al.248 employed ammonium-exchanged titanate nanowires (ATNWs) as the titanium precursor and hexamethylenetetramine (HMTA) as the capping agent to hydrothermally synthesize nano-sized TiO2 nanocrystals with well-defined facets. They proposed that the transformation mechanism from ATNWs to TiO2 nanocrystals might be a “dissolution–nucleation” process. At the initial transformation, the surface of ATNWs gradually decomposed and formed Ti(OH)4 fragments, ammonia and potassium ions at a high temperature under hydrothermal conditions. Ti(OH)4 fragments were then rearranged through a dehydration reaction between Ti–OH and HO–Ti in an edge-sharing pattern, leading to the formation of anatase TiO2 crystal nuclei. After that, the TiO2 nuclei grew up to produce TiO2 nanocrystals when Ti(OH)4 fragments diffused to their surfaces. This transformation mechanism was basically quite different from the in-site transformation and topochemical reaction for other titanates.
Very recently, a carbonate ion-assisted synthesis strategy for fabricating anatase TiO2 nanoparticles exposed with high energy {001} facets has been employed. Han et al.100 used potassium titanate nanowires (KTNWs) as a titanium precursor and urea as a surface regulator. Without doubt, at a high reaction temperature, urea decomposes into CO2 and NH3 and is converted to carbonate and ammonium ions in the alkaline environment. Their experimental results demonstrated that the carbonate ions decomposed from urea in a basic environment could effectively reduce the surface energy of {001} facets, resulting in the formation of {001} facets. It is worth mentioning that the transformation of KTNWs into anatase was relatively slow under hydrothermal conditions as compared to the hydrolysis process of other titanium precursors. Therefore, such a slow transformation process kinetically provided an opportunity for carbonate ions to lower the surface energy of {001} facets via specific adsorption during the crystal growth. Also, they revealed that the percentage of {001} facets increased with the amount of urea. With the addition of urea into the reaction medium, tetragonal bipyramidal TiO2 nanoparticles, which were fully enclosed by {101} facets, were gradually truncated and the percentage of {001} facets increased from 5% to a maximum value of 60%. Similar observations were also further analyzed and confirmed by the same group of researchers by using KTNWs as the titanium precursor and HMTA as the capping agent.215 SEM images revealed that truncated tetragonal bipyramidal particles were formed with top and bottom, flat and square surfaces. The authors claimed that the observation might be due to the presence of HMTA or its decomposed units in lowering the surface energy of {001} facets. It is known that HMTA could decompose into ammonium and carbonate at a high temperature. According to their previous report,100 the carbonate ions could lower the surface energy of {001} facets, whereas ammonium could serve as a pH buffer to provide a stable environment for the growth of well-shaped TiO2 crystals.
Moreover, hydrophilic polymers such as PVA and PVP have been used as shape-controlling reagents of metal and metal oxide particles.249 In general, PVA is a well-known non-toxic hydrophilic polymer and can be easily removed by photocatalytic decomposition. Murakami et al.140 reported a facile hydrothermal treatment of peroxo titanic acid (PTA) solution using PVA as a shape-control reagent to develop anatase TiO2 with specific exposed crystal facets under neutral conditions. They claimed that the crystal phase, shape and size of TiO2 particles were strongly dependent on the pH of the PTA solution and also the duration of hydrothermal treatment. TEM images revealed that square and diamond-like projections were mainly observed for the TiO2 particles prepared by >12 h of hydrothermal treatment, implying the formation of decahedral anatase TiO2 with {001} and {101} exposed crystal facets. They discussed a plausible mechanism of shape evolution of anatase TiO2 particles involving dissolution and recrystallization processes as displayed in Fig. 32. The mechanism of the formation of anatase TiO2 was as follows: (1) formation of anatase rods having a stacked structure with decahedral anatase with {101} and {001} crystal facets and growth in the [001] direction, (2) transformation of anatase rods into octahedral anatase by size reduction along the [001] direction or by being split along the (001) plane in the dissolution process, and (3) growth of anatase TiO2 in the [001] direction with the exposure of the {101} crystal face and evolution of decahedral anatase in the recrystallization process.

Although much smaller TiO2 nanocrystals (∼20 nm) could be fabricated using a surfactant-capping solvothermal method, synthesizing mesoporous spheres composed of TiO2 nanocrystals with oriented {001} facets still remains a challenge. Also, the current as-produced hollow TiO2 spheres consisting of TiO2 crystals with exposed {001} facets were too large to obtain a high specific surface area and suitable pore structure. Therefore, Liu et al.250 developed a facile new method that combined both electrospray and hydrothermal treatment to prepare mesoporous core–shell TiO2 spheres with high specific surface areas, high pore volumes and narrow pore size distribution. The resulting TiO2 spheres were composed of small anatase TiO2 nanocrystals with exposed step-like {001} and smooth {010} facets. They concluded that the percentage of exposed {001} facets could be adjusted by changing the amount of PVP used during the electrospray process and also the concentration of acetic acid added during the hydrothermal process. The formation mechanism of mesoporous TiO2 spheres with core–shell structure is summarized and shown in Fig. 33c. Basically, the PVP–TBOT sol was atomized into a large number of micro-sized particles under high voltage during electrospray. Considering that the spherical particles were highly dispersed in the air atmosphere, the rapid vaporization of organic solvents and then hydrolysis of TBOT produced a solid surface on the TiO2 spheres. This solid surface acted as a protective layer which hindered further rapid vaporization and hydrolysis. As a result of slow vaporization and hydrolysis of the inside TiO2 spheres, the inner spheres shrunk and collapsed forming a core–shell structure (Fig. 33a). During electrospray, the PVP polymer formed a network in which the amorphous TiO2 particles could fill the pores. However, during the subsequent hydrothermal treatment, the polymer network was destroyed resulting in the formation of tiny TiO2 particles with exposed high energy facets (Fig. 33b).

Besides that, H2O2 has been recently proven by Li et al.141 to be a competent candidate as a facile and relatively environmentally benign structure-directing agent to synthesize crystal phase-, morphology- and facet-controllable TiO2. By adjusting the concentration of H2O2, anatase TiO2 microspheres with exposed {001} facets were successfully constructed. The presence of H2O2 favored the formation of the anatase phase. Evidently, with increasing concentration of H2O2 in the range of 0–0.7 M, the crystal structure of TiO2 evolved gradually from pure rutile to bicrystalline phases of anatase and rutile, and finally to a pure anatase phase, along with changes in morphology from short rods to a mixture of rods and octahedral crystals and lastly to microflowers with dominant {101} facets as presented in Fig. 34a–c. When the concentration of H2O2 was kept in the range of 07–3.3 M, only anatase TiO2 microflowers with exposed {101} facets were attained (Fig. 34c and d). In contrast, when the concentration of H2O2 was increased to 6.6 M, anatase TiO2 microspheres with preferential {001} facets were obtained (Fig. 34e). Further increasing the H2O2 concentration promoted the formation of a higher percentage of exposed {001} facets on anatase TiO2 microspheres (Fig. 34f). The appearance of {001} facets could be elucidated by the DFT calculations. Under high H2O2 concentrations, the peroxo-titanium structure played a decisive role in developing anatase TiO2. The peroxygen-containing species would preferentially adsorb onto {001} facets rather than {101} facets due to the different adsorption energies on both facets, leading to a surface energy of the (001) plane comparable to (or even lower than) that of the (101) plane. Therefore, slow growth along the [001] direction will result in the formation of vertex-truncated octahedral encompassing exposed {001} facets. A schematic mechanism is depicted in Fig. 34g to account for the effect of H2O2 on the crystal structure and morphology of {001} facet-exposed TiO2. This work is anticipated to pave a new research direction for the use of H2O2 as a crystallographic controlling agent to fabricate other morphology- and facet-controllable micro- and nanomaterials in the near future.

Until now, most studies have greatly revolved around the use of TiO2 nanosheets, nanocuboids and microspheres for the preparation of TiO2 photocatalysts with high energy {001} facets. Very recently, several groups of researchers have reported on the synthesis of TiO2 nanotubes (TNTs) with exposed {001} facets instead of conventional nanosheet, nanocuboid or microsphere structures.81,85 In contrast to TiO2 nanoparticles, TNTs exhibit a considerably higher specific surface (inner and outer) area with a large number of reactive sites.45,251,252 The high aspect ratio of TNTs contributes to the improved photocatalytic activities.253 Jung et al.85 developed highly ordered TNTs with exposed {001} facets by potentiostatic anodization in two-electrode electrochemical cells on Ti foil using surfactant-assisted processes with PVP and acetic acid. PVP in the electrolyte solution, which acted as a surfactant and controller of the crystal growth, was preferentially adsorbed on the {101} surfaces. The growth of {001} facets proceeded rapidly resulting in the synthesis of single-crystal-like anatase TiO2 with mainly the {001} facet-exposed, which could effectively retard the occurrence of charge recombination and also allow more dye adsorption in the DSSCs. An enhancement in the overall conversion efficiency of DSSCs was obtained using a TiO2 photoanode with 77% exposed {001} facets due to the increased number of exposed active {001} facets.
Most recently, a novel synthesis route was developed by employing a natural clay mineral for the controlled synthesis of well shape-defined TiO2 crystals with exposed high energy {001} facets. For the very first time, Wang et al.237 employed a novel and environmentally benign hydrothermal synthesis strategy for the successful synthesis of TiO2 nanocuboids with wholly exposed high energy {001} and {100} facets by using low cost acid-delaminated vermiculite (DVMT) and tetramethylammonium hydroxide as synergistic shape-directing agents. It is noted that the DVMT layers functioned as an effective hard template selectively stabilizing the {001} facets of TiO2. Moreover, tetramethylammonium hydroxide also served as a dual-functional reagent, both facilitating the hydrolysis of TTIP and also stabilizing the anatase polyanionic cores [TixOyHz−1]− formed at the early stage of crystal growth.
In addition to the aforementioned hydrothermal or solvothermal strategies, Amano et al.110 developed a special gas phase reaction process to fabricate {001} facet-dominated decahedral anatase TiO2 with sizes of 50–250 nm via hydrolysis of TiCl4 with rapid heating and quenching for the first time. Uniform and rapid heating at a high temperature of 1200 °C enabled homogeneous nucleation and subsequent growth to well-faceted TiO2 crystals with few defects for the enhancement in the photocatalytic activity. The low concentration of TiCl4 and the narrow heating zone would inhibit the formation of large particles and polycrystalline aggregates with the grain boundaries. In a recent study, Lee and Sung254 reported the direct synthesis of high density anatase {001} nanosheets on silicon and silicon-coated substrates via a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process considering that CVD is by far the most well-established and effective method for the growth of nanocrystals. To prevent anatase-to-rutile phase transformation, the substrate temperature was maintained as low as 450 °C and instead H2 autoignition was induced to supply additional heat and pressure to enable the evaporation of silicon. Subsequently, Ti and O2 were provided and TiO2 crystals formed on the substrates. It is anticipated that silicon vapor, which acted as a morphology-directing agent instead of F− species, could suppress the growth of TiO2 crystals into a (001) plane, resulting in the formation of 2D {001} nanosheets. The proposed growth mechanism of TiO2 nanosheets is depicted in Fig. 35. Overall, this synthesis in this sub-section was regarded as a new approach since no fluorine-containing reagents were involved in stabilizing the {001} facets of TiO2 particles. On the whole, the exploration of fluorine-free synthesis of TiO2 crystals with exposed {001} facets is very exciting and gaining in momentum among the researchers worldwide for further breakthroughs in this emerging front of research.

3. Crystal facet engineering of modified-TiO2 with {001} facets
Although increasing the percentage of exposed {001} facets would efficiently improve the photocatalytic activity, bare TiO2 with energetic {001} facets is only driven by UV light, accounting for ca. 4% of the solar spectrum. For efficient utilization of visible light to mimic the natural sunlight source, it is essential to fabricate novel TiO2-based photocatalysts with a high percentage of {001} facets which can work effectively under a wide range of visible light irradiation. Various strategies have been carried out for extending the spectral response of the {001}-exposed anatase TiO2 crystals to the visible light region and also enhancing the photocatalytic efficiency of TiO2. They can be summarized as either morphological modifications or chemical modifications such as introducing additional components in the TiO2 structure for band gap tuning.48,113,117 In addition, the heterostructured narrow band gap semiconductor coupling is also another primary way to extend the TiO2-based photocatalysts to the visible light range.259,260 In this section, we will critically evaluate the preparation and characterization of transition metal, noble metal and non-metal doped TiO2 with {001} facets as photoactive photocatalysts and also the recent utilization of a carbonaceous material namely graphene as a high performance 2D support for decorating TiO2 with preferential {001} facets, which opens up new opportunities for designing next generation photocatalysts to harvest visible light. Table 2 summarizes the various preparation methods of synthesizing visible light responsive modified-TiO2 crystals with exposed {001} high energy facets.

3.1. Doping {001}-faceted TiO2 with transition metal or metal oxide
Since the activation of pure TiO2 can only take place under UV light irradiation, a great number of doped TiO2 has been designed with the aim to achieve visible-light driven photocatalysts.261–266 Several methods have been used to synthesize doped TiO2 photocatalysts, such as sol–gel,154 solvothermal alcoholysis,201 hydrothermal hydrolysis,95 aerosol-spray267 and so forth. Transition metals such as titanium130 and molybdenum268 have been reported to enhance the photoactivity of pure TiO2 in the visible light region. Very recently, in situ Ti3+-doped TiO2 crystals in mesoporous nanosheets with dominant {001} facets were prepared by Wang et al.130 through supercritical technology. The Ti3+ species were generated from the reduction of Ti4+ by organic substances and/or residues under supercritical conditions and the in situ Ti3+-doped TiO2 displayed oxygen vacancies due to the replacement of Ti4+ by Ti3+ in the TiO2 lattice. The percentage of exposed {001} facets was observed to increase with supercritical temperature going from 240 °C to 260 °C, and then gradually decreased with any further increase in supercritical temperature. To estimate the percentage of exposed {001} facets, the authors calculated the ratio between peak intensities (004) and (101) in the XRD patterns. It should be noted that this estimation method is different from that used by Ye's group132 (see Section 2.1.2.4), who determined the percentage of exposed {001} facets using the peak intensity ratio of (010) and (101). Wang et al.130 observed that the {001} facet contained a higher amount of oxygen vacancies as compared to the conventional {101} facet as evidenced by the Raman spectra in Fig. 36a. The positive shift of the principle peak position by 6.5 cm−1 from the Raman spectra (Fig. 36a) confirmed the existence of more oxygen vacancies in the TiO2-260. The presence of Ti3+-dopants and the oxygen vacancies in TiO2 resulted in the production of new energy levels below the CB,57,269 thus leading to the spectral response in the visible area. This is in accordance with the UV-Vis spectra results as presented in Fig. 36b. It is noted that the light absorbance in the visible area enhanced with increasing the supercritical temperature from 240 to 260 °C, which could be attributed to the enhanced Ti3+-dopants, oxygen vacancies and percentage of {001} facets. However, they speculated that a further increase in the supercritical temperature resulted in the decreased absorbance for visible light possibly due to the reduction in the percentage of exposed {001} facets. On the other hand, the high degree of crystallization accelerated the migration of electrons, and hence, inhibited the recombination of electron–hole pairs. Moreover, the exposed {001} facets with high surface energy favored the activation of reactant molecules, greatly enhancing the photocatalytic efficiency of the Ti3+-doped TiO2 crystals in synchronical pollutant degradation and water splitting to produce H2.

In most cases, metal nanocrystals are anchored onto the surfaces of semiconductors as isolated “islands” to produce heterointerfaces.270–272 Despite their effective catalytic activity, the drawback of these structures is that the metal and oxide surfaces are exposed to reactants, products and the surrounding medium. Corrosion or dissolution of the metallic particles during a photocatalytic reaction becomes problematic in practical applications.273 Therefore, it is of importance to design new strategies to improve the chemical stability and attain higher photocatalytic efficiencies at the same time. Using the arc-discharge technique, Liu and co-workers prepared Mo-{001} TiO2 core–shell nanoparticles with TiO2 as the shell and crystalline Mo nanoparticles as the core.268 Owing to the suitable match between the surface energy of TiO2 {001} facets and that of Mo nanoparticles, the {001} facets were observed for all anatase TiO2 shells. The Mo–TiO2 core–shell nanoparticles exhibited an absorption edge red shift to around 514 nm. Consistent with the effect of Ti3+ doping, this observation could be understood by the band gap narrowing resulting from the formation of a Mo-impurity level below the CB minimum of TiO2.268
In another paper, Wang et al.81 pretreated the Ti foils via a hydrothermal process at 140 °C for 10 h and then immersed in Na2SO4 solution containing NaF in a two-electrode cell. Electrochemical anodization was employed at 20 V for 2 h at room temperature. The authors also synthesized TiO2 films with oriented {001} facets and CdS nanoparticles were coated on the TiO2 film by sequential chemical bath deposition. HF generated played dual roles during synthesis: (1) to partially dissolve Ti foil into a soluble Ti complex for the growth of TiO2 crystals and (2) to act as a morphology-controlling agent. The photocurrent was greatly improved after loading CdS on the {001}-faceted TiO2 film due to the direct transport of electrons from CdS CB minimum to TiO2 CB minimum under visible light irradiation to reduce the recombination rate of charge carriers. Thus, a unique Z-scheme electron–hole transport mechanism to occur on the heterojunctions of highly reactive {001} facets of TiO2 and CdS was proposed.
In addition to transition metals, experimental and theoretical calculations have revealed that surface modification of TiO2 with metal oxide particles can also be an effective route to superior composite photocatalytic materials.265,274 Metal oxides with narrow band gaps such as Cu2O,275 BiWO6 (ref. 276) and BiVO4 (ref. 277) have been reported to act as sensitizers of TiO2, which ultimately displayed significantly enhanced photocatalytic performance under visible light irradiation. However, in most cases, the size distributions of the modified particles on TiO2 are difficult to control and usually exhibit sizes of 5 nm and above. It is widely known that the electronic structures of semiconductor nanocrystals are greatly dependent on the particle size. Hence, it is reasonable to infer that the sizes of the heterojunctions would have direct effects on the composites' photocatalytic performances. When the modified particles are as small as 2–3 nm, the charge transfer between these particles and TiO2 would be greatly accelerated due to the rapid diffusion of charge carriers.278 Therefore, it is desirable to develop highly active TiO2-based photocatalytic materials by incorporating the synergetic promoting effects of ultrafine metal oxide particles and active crystal facets.
In this regard, Liu et al.279 successfully loaded ultra-small Cu2O nanoparticles with controllable sizes from 1.5 to 3.0 nm onto the surface of TiO2 nanosheets with exposed {001} facets through a hydrothermal synthesis route. According to the STEM images in Fig. 37a–f, the size of the amorphous particles grew with the increase of Cu content, signifying that these ultra-small particles were made up by Cu element. The heterojunctions formed between Cu2O and TiO2 induced visible light absorption and the efficient separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs. By examining the products harvested at different intervals of reaction times, the authors studied the formation mechanism and growth process of the Cu2O–TiO2 nanosheets (Fig. 37g–j). At the initial stage of the hydrothermal reaction, poorly crystalline TiO2 nanoparticles were first formed through the hydrolysis of TBOT. Only small TiO2 nanoparticles (5–20 nm) with irregular shapes were formed after 6 h and no Cu2O nanoparticles were found on TiO2 (Fig. 37a). With prolongation of reaction time (up to 18 h), crystallization was enhanced and Cu2O nanoparticles were observed on the surface of the rectangular TiO2 sheets (Fig. 37c) due to the hydrolysis and reduction of copper(II) acetate (Cu(Ac)2). The charge transfer across the interface was reported to be more efficient between TiO2 nanosheets and smaller Cu2O nanoparticles. Therefore, the Ti:Cu = 30:1 (atomic ratio) sample was shown to display the best photoactivity due to its balance in the light harvest and electron transfer rate in the degradation of phenol under visible light.279 Furthermore, PL spectra were utilized to study the effect of Cu2O–TiO2 heterojunction on the electron–hole separation. Surprisingly, no obvious emission peak could be found around 400 nm (Fig. 37l), highlighting that these PL signals did not result from the electron transition from the CB to the valence band (VB) of TiO2. Apart from that, the PL intensities of Cu2O–TiO2 nanosheets were lower than those of pure TiO2 nanosheets, revealing lower electron–hole recombination probability in Cu2O–TiO2. Coupling with UV-Vis spectra (Fig. 37k) indicated improved visible light absorption at 500–700 nm in Cu2O–TiO2 nanosheets, which strongly suggests the formation of heterojunctions between Cu2O and TiO2 for the efficient separation of electron–hole pairs and enhanced visible light activity. To the best of our knowledge, little attention has been paid to the crystal facets of TiO2 in the metal oxide–TiO2 composites. Therefore, this work will be feasible to develop highly active TiO2-based photocatalytic materials for visible light applications through combining the advantages of both metal oxide particles and active crystal facets.

Following the photocatalytic reactions, time-consuming processes such as intensive centrifugation are typically required to recover the TiO2-based photocatalysts. Furthermore, Dotzauer et al.280 pointed out that separation and recycling are crucial for the reproducibility of the photocatalysts and also the separation is not efficient as it uses complex methods. Therefore, an attractive alternative would be to remove and recycle them through magnetic separation.281 By employing SiO2-coated hematite (α-Fe2O3) nanospindles as the starting templates, Chen and co-workers synthesized three types of ellipsoidal complex hollow structures with shells assembled from anatase TiO2 nanosheets with exposed {001} facets (Fig. 38).282 Through in situ reduction of α-Fe2O3 to Fe3O4, the built-in magnetic functionality was easily achievable. The resulting Fe3O4–TiO2 nanorattles displayed remarkable photocatalytic activity in the degradation of MB. More importantly, these photocatalysts were easily recoverable from the treated solution by simply applying a magnetic field.

On the pure TiO2 nanosheets, it is well-known that the photoinduced electrons transfer to {101} facets with the holes to {001} facets, forming reductive and oxidative sites, respectively. However, the nanosheets are generally large which require a long pathway for the travelling of electrons from the {001} surface to the {101} boundary. Due to the long pathway, charge recombination is very likely to occur which could suppress the inherent photoactivity. A common solution for this problem is to decorate nanosheets with electron acceptors like noble metals, which will be discussed in Section 3.2. Alternatively, the in situ formed quantum-sized TiO2 is deemed to be a cheap, facile and effective choice. Very recently, the fabrication of the quantum dot self-decorated and defect-free anatase TiO2 nanosheets was reported for the first time by Pan et al.283 using an in situ hydrothermal strategy as indicated in Fig. 39a. Surprisingly, the long time hydrothemal strategy and subsequent defect healing were the key to obtain defect-free nanosheets decorated with TiO2 quantum dots. Evidently, 24 h hydrothermal treatment (denoted A-24) produced clean nanosheets from HRTEM (Fig. 39b), whereas long hydrothermal treatment (72 h (denoted A-72) or 168 h (denoted A-168)) produced many nanodots of the size of ca. 1.5–3 nm on the TiO2 nanosheets and interestingly, the amount increased with time (Fig. 39c and d). Furthermore, the surface chemistry of nanosheets was not changed until hydrothermal treatment was up to 168 h from the XPS and EPR analysis (Fig. 39e and f). For A-168, the XPS results signal at 457.7 eV and the low temperature EPR signals of gxx = gyy = g⊥ = 1.989 and gzz = g‖ = 1.961 were assigned to the presence of Ti3+ defects. To remove the surface Ti3+ defects, the authors reported two approaches namely (1) hydrothermal treatment with deionized water (denoted A-168H) and (2) thermal calcination at 500 °C (denoted A-168C). XPS indicated that both samples exhibited complete removal of surface Ti3+, which was also confirmed by the disappearance of EPR signals, for the improvement in photocatalytic performance. By combining the advantages of quantum dots TiO2, highly reactive {001} facets and free of defects on the nanosheets, it is strongly believed that this work could provide a new and promising approach to enhance the overall photocatalytic performance.

3.2. Doping {001}-faceted TiO2 with noble metal
Noble metals have also attracted a similarly dramatic rise in research interest due to their extraordinary electronic, magnetic and optical properties.284 It has been widely reported that noble metals such as Pt, Au, and Ag have the ability to strongly absorb visible light due to their SPR effect.285 Therefore, the deposition of noble metal nanoparticles on TiO2 is considered as an extremely viable approach to extend the spectral response of TiO2 to visible light.286–288 To date, various methods have been reported to prepare noble metal-decorated TiO2, including the conventional impregnation, photodeposition, deposition–precipitation and sol–gel methods.289–291 However, owing to the high rate of particle formation, most of these synthesis routes are not feasible to generate noble metal nanoparticles of small and uniform sizes. In addition, the photocatalytic activities of noble metal-semiconductor nanocomposites are strongly dependent on their sizes. Therefore, to incorporate the merits of both {001}-faceted TiO2 and noble metals, it is important to develop a controllable method to synthesize uniform, nano-sized and well-dispersed noble metal particles on the TiO2 crystals.
Recently, Zhu et al.113 demonstrated the synthesis of novel visible-light driven plasmonic Au–TiO2 photocatalysts with a high percentage of exposed {001} facets. The composites were prepared by simple hydrothermal treatment of TBOT and HF, followed by a sulfide-mediated polyol reduction process. HRTEM confirmed that Au nanoparticles with an average diameter of ca. 5.0 nm were well-dispersed on {001}-faceted anatase TiO2 nanosheets (Fig. 40A and B). Due to the SPR effect of Au, the as-prepared Au–TiO2-001 samples exhibited stronger absorption in the visible light region than the bare TiO2 sample, implying that the Au–TiO2-001 was active under visible light irradiation. Evidently, the absorption peak at ca. 546 nm was assigned to the characteristic SPR peak of Au nanoparticles (Fig. 40C). It was found that the optical absorption thresholds of band gap transition on TiO2 for all samples were almost similar before and after Au deposition, suggesting that Au only deposited on the TiO2 surface instead of doping into the crystal lattice of TiO2.

As mentioned earlier, heterostructures with metal core and semiconductor shell have been regarded as one of the strongest candidates as photocatalysts due to their controllable chemical and colloidal stability within the shell and charge transfer between metal cores and semiconductors.268 Wu and co-workers successfully demonstrated the synthesis of core–shell Au–TiO2 nanoparticles with truncated wedge-shaped TiO2 morphology.292 TEM, HRTEM and XRD results confirmed that the wedge-like TiO2 shells experienced an epitaxially segmented orientation growth. In addition, the (101) crystal planes of TiO2 grew preferentially on the surface of Au nanocrystals to maintain low interface energy, thus stabilizing the heterointerfaces. The rapid [001] growth resulted in budding TiO2 antennae, where “unfledged antennae” were formed. These served as growth sites for further development into the wedge-like morphology. Fig. 41 shows the possible formation process of the core–shell Au–TiO2 nanoparticles. The morphological evolution of TiO2 shells was shown to be dependent on the concentration of F− ions produced. The F− ions not only facilitated the production of well-defined wedge-like TiO2 shells, but also contributed to the truncated crystal {001} facets.292

In addition to Au noble metal dopants, the preparation of Pt-doped TiO2 nanosheets with exposed {001} facets has also been reported. In the paper by Yu and co-workers,108 Pt/{001}-faceted TiO2 nanosheets were prepared by hydrothermal treatment of TBOT and HF aqueous solution, followed by photochemical reduction deposition of Pt nanoparticles on the nanosheets under xenon lamp illumination. Characterization results revealed that Pt acted as an effective electron accepter. The Pt nanoparticles on the TiO2 sheets formed a Schottky barrier, which facilitated the capture of photogenerated electrons. By comparing the PL spectra of Pt/{001}-faceted TiO2 and Pt/fluorine-free TiO2 nanosheets, the former showed a stronger PL peak, indicating that surface fluorination can enhance the migration of photogenerated electrons and prolong the lifespan of the electron–hole pairs (Fig. 42a and b). Owing to the positive synergetic effects of {001}-faceted TiO2 and noble metals, these composites can be applied in various fields such as solar cells, photonic and optoelectronic devices, sensors, catalysis, nanotechnology and many more.

3.3. Doping {001}-faceted TiO2 with non-metal
One of the avenues to improve the performance of pure TiO2 with exposed {001} facets is to enhance its optical absorption by shifting the onset of its response from the UV to the visible region. A promising strategy is the doping of TiO2 {001} facets with non-metal elements such as nitrogen,114 sulfur,293 carbon119 and so forth. The underlying principle behind this approach is to sensitize TiO2 towards visible light by introducing newly created mid-gap levels resulting in the narrowing of the band gap energy. The observed narrower band gap by shifting the UV to the visible region has been attributed to the following reasons: (1) substitution of lattice oxygen by the anion and (2) formation of interstitial species in vacancies giving rise to surface or near surface states. Therefore, this favors the utilization of visible light solar energy and reduces the dependency on UV light.
Although non-metal doping, in particular nitrogen doping, has exhibited huge potential in introducing visible light absorption of TiO2, it is still challenging yet desirable to incorporate dopants into anatase TiO2 with dominant {001} facets. This is due to very high crystallinity of well-faceted anatase TiO2 particles making it difficult to incorporate dopants into them by mild post-treatment.115 At the same time, addition of dopant precursors into the reaction medium can negatively affect the nucleation and growth of anatase TiO2 crystals, such that no desirable TiO2 sheets are obtained.116 Therefore, new synthesis strategies directed towards this objective are of great significance.
Recently, significant progress in the development of visible light responsive {001} faceted-TiO2 has been achieved by Liu and co-workers,115 who reported the synthesis of nitrogen doped micro-sized anatase TiO2 crystallites with dominant {001} facets. However, the practical photocatalytic activity of such micro-sized materials is intrinsically limited because of the relatively large particle size and very small specific surface area. Therefore, there is an urgent need to fabricate visible light responsive nano-sized anatase TiO2 particles with preferential {001} facets instead of large micro-sized crystals. Xiang et al.114 synthesized nitrogen self-doped TiO2 nanosheets (NTNs) with 67% exposed {001} facets by solvothermal treatment of TiN in a HNO3–HF ethanol solution. Similar to elsewhere,112 the chemical reaction which happened between TiN and HNO3 could be described as follows: TiN + 8HNO3 → TiO2 + 9NO2↑ + 4H2O(26)
Based on the XRD pattern, it is noted that the intensity of the (200) diffraction peak of NTNs was more intense and sharper than that of the (004) peak, implying a preferential growth in the [001] direction due to the presence of F− ions from HF. The formation mechanism of NTNs with dominant {001} facets could be elucidated by capping of F− ions and ethanol in the reaction system. They reported that TiO2 could not be produced from TiN in ethanol without HNO3, which catalyzed the formation of TiO2 from the TiN precursor. On the other hand, ethanol, which was used as a capping agent in controlling the synthesis of {001} facets, could hinder the growth of TiO2 along the c-axis or [001] direction owing to its specific binding with the TiO2 surface via the Ti–O–C bond. A similar role of alcohol in promoting the oriented crystal growth attributable to specific orientation of alcohol molecules and also the aforementioned specific binding was also shown elsewhere and described in previous sections.134,152,154,163,194 In another paper, Zhou and co-workers116 improved the synthesis routes to nitrogen-doped TiO2 with dominant {001} facets conducted by Xiang et al.114via solvothermal treatment of TiN in an acidic NaBF4 solution. Their approach was relatively less toxic than the traditional hydrolysis route since the direct use of HF could be avoided. They also highlighted that the wet chemistry oxidation process in NaBF4 acidic solution resulted in not only nitrogen-doped TiO2 in the anatase phase, but also a large percentage of {001} facets induced by the surface Ti–B–F bonds.
Capitalizing on this recent step forward, it is expected that such synthesis approaches employed for nitrogen-doped {001} faceted-TiO2 may be extended to prepare other non-metal doped anatase TiO2 crystals with preferential {001} facets by utilizing the corresponding titanium precursors. This expectation was indeed realized by Liu et al.293 who reported sulfur-doped anatase TiO2 sheets with a large percentage of reactive {001} facets synthesized from HF hydrolysis of crystalline titanium sulfide (TiS2). The as-produced sulfur-doped TiO2 sheets exhibited an additional visible light absorption band between 400 and 550 nm from the UV-Vis absorption spectrum. Its band gap was found to be 3.17 eV, which was nearly identical to that of undoped anatase TiO2 sheets. This proved that the intrinsic band gap of the TiO2 sheets was not altered; rather, localized states associated with the S dopants were formed in the band gap of TiO2. This statement could be justified in conjunction with the first-principles calculations to understand the origin of visible light absorption in the sulfur-doped TiO2 sheets as depicted in Fig. 43. Structural models of {101} and {001} surfaces with substituted S for lattice O are shown in Fig. 43A and B. Analysis of calculated band structures, namely density of states (DOS), revealed three main features: (1) the intrinsic band gap of both {001} and {101} surfaces was not varied by sulfur doping, (2) the local states of S 3p were introduced between CB and VB (see Fig. 43C(b) and D(d)), and (3) the localized states in the band gap of the {001} surface were closer to VB maximum in comparison to that of the {101} surface, demonstrating that stronger oxidative holes were generated by sulfur-doped TiO2 with exposed {001} facets upon visible light irradiation.

Besides nitrogen- and sulfur-doping, further studies on the development of anatase TiO2 crystals with preferential {001} facets doped with other non-metal elements are highly necessary from the viewpoint of photocatalytic applications. It is noteworthy that carbon-doping is a promising strategy to induce visible light absorption.294–297 For the first time, Yu et al.119 focused on the synthesis of carbon self-doped TiO2 sheets (CTS) with exposed {001} facets. CTS were prepared in a HNO3–HF mixed aqueous solution by hydrothermal treatment of titanium carbide (TiC) acting as a precursor of TiO2 and a source of carbon. TiC reacted with HNO3 to form TiO2 as shown in eqn (27). They revealed that F− ions prevented the phase transition of anatase to rutile due to the stronger affinity of F− ions to titanium in aqueous solutions than NO3−. As a result, the strong affinity of F− ions inhibited the structural rearrangement of octahedral units and subsequently, the phase transformation. TiC + 8HNO3 → TiO2 + 8NO2↑ + CO2↑ + 4H2O(27)
The carbon doping into the lattice of TiO2 was evidenced by the calculated cell parameters based on the XRD results. It is inferred that the calculated lattice parameters of the CTS (a = b = 3.791 Å, c = 9.697 Å) were slightly different in comparison to the cell parameters of pure anatase TiO2 (a = b = 3.785 Å, c = 9.514 Å), indicating carbon doping into the TiO2 lattice. Furthermore, the substitution of carbon with oxygen resulted in a series of localized occupied states in the band gap between the VB and the CB, which explained the absorption edge shift to the visible region. Such a phenomenon has been theoretically predicted by Valentin et al.296 They also examined the origin of the electronic structure modification of the C-doped TiO2 by taking into account the total DOS and the projected DOS (PDOS) as demonstrated in Fig. 44. Based on the DFT calculations, it can be concluded that three localized impurity states were formed in the middle of VB maximum and CB minimum (see Fig. 44A and B). More importantly, when C was doped into TiO2, the energy levels associated with C 2p electrons were higher than those of O 2p at the top of the VB, and these states did not qualitatively change the distribution of the O 2p and Ti 3d states (see Fig. 44C and D). Consequently, the top of the VB showed an increase of about 1 eV, and therefore the electron transition energy from the VB to the CB displayed a decrease of about 1 eV leading to a red shift of the optical absorption edge.

In another study, Chen et al.82 reported a two-step method to develop carbon-supported ultrathin anatase TiO2 nanosheets using DETA, which served as both the capping agent during the initial solvothermal synthesis that stabilized the {001} facets of TiO2 and also the carbon source during the subsequent carbonization process. After the formation of large ultrathin anatase TiO2 nanosheets, it was then followed by self-organization into more complete 3D nanostructures as observed in Fig. 45. As can be seen in Fig. 45a, uniform spheres with diameters of approximately 1.5 μm were obtained, indicating that the introduction of the nano-carbon support did not contribute to noticeable alteration to the morphology. Under higher magnifications (Fig. 45b and d), it is verified that these microspheres were indeed assembled from the nanosheet building blocks. From the visual perception, the authors also claimed that the observation of a black color implied the formation of amorphous carbon. When evaluated for electrochemical lithium storage, the enhanced lithium storage performance from the carbon-supported ultrathin anatase TiO2 nanosheets was attributed to the ultrathin nanosheet structure allowing efficient Li+ ion diffusion along the c-axis as well as the effective nanocarbon support promoting better structural stability. Furthermore, the high specific surface area granted more lithium insertion sites and also the large internal voids of the porous structures provided more space to buffer the volume change during extended charge–discharge processes.90

Instead of carbon being doped into the lattice of anatase TiO2, it has been found that carbon species could also adsorb onto the surface of TiO2 crystals as an efficient photocatalyst to extend the photoresponse of TiO2 into the visible light range of the solar spectrum through the electronic coupling of π states of the graphite-like carbon and the CB states of TiO2. Zhang et al.298 prepared visible-light driven graphite-like carbon deposited single crystal anatase TiO2 with exposed {001} facets through a two-step solvothermal process by employing TiF4 and glucose as titanium and carbon precursors. The first step involved the fabrication of anatase TiO2 single crystals with dominant {001} facets, whereas the second step was the deposition of graphite-like carbon layers on the surface of TiO2 (C/TiO2) via the dehydration of glucose during the solvothermal treatment. It is believed that such a conjugated material will become an excellent candidate for enhancing the transport of photocarriers during the photocatalytic process through the formation of electronic interactions with TiO2. This hypothesis was well-supported by the surface photovoltage (SPV) and also the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) results. They confirmed that the SPV peak of C/TiO2 was much lower and weaker than that of TiO2, indicating that most of the photogenerated electrons were transported to the carbon layers which acted as a strong electronic conductor. Also, the smaller arc radius of the EIS Nyquist plot for C/TiO2 than that for TiO2 strongly concluded the high efficiency of charge carrier separation between TiO2 and the carbon layer.
3.4. Multi-doped {001}-faceted TiO2 with metal and non-metal
Other than the frequently reported mono-doped TiO2 as discussed in Sections 3.1–3.3, multi-doped TiO2 composites have also been extensively investigated as a result of their enhanced photocatalytic performance due to synergistic combinations derived from using different dopants namely metal, metal oxide and non-metal. Recently, the simultaneous doping of two kinds of non-metal atoms into a TiO2 lattice to tune the electronic structure has attracted widespread attention which can help the separation of photogenerated electrons and holes, and also to enhance the visible light photocatalytic activity. For instance, Zong et al.118 synthesized visible light responsive anatase TiO2 platelets with dominant {001} facets via a facile solid nitridation reaction from a TiOF2 precursor. They claimed that although this solid phase pathway has been rarely investigated, it is considered to be highly flexible and efficient in preparing multi-doped visible light responsive TiO2 with exposed {001} facets. By nitriding a TiOF2 precursor in NH3 gas flow, the high flow rate of NH3 would facilitate the collapse of TiO2 boxes into TiO2 platelets and at the same time, F and N could be simultaneously co-doped into the TiO2 lattice, resulting in drastically enhanced absorption and also notable water oxidation under visible light. Evidently, the absorption of the resulting samples was red-shifted to 570–580 nm, corresponding to a band gap of approximately 2.1–2.2 eV. The absorption could be ascribed to the formation of Ti3+ species under a reducing atmosphere and also the content of Ti3+ species increased with the nitridation temperature. On the other hand, the featureless absorption disappeared when the samples were further calcined between 673 and 873 K in air, implying the decrease of Ti3+ species upon post-calcination.
Besides nitrogen and fluorine co-doping, nitrogen and sulphur co-doped TiO2 nanosheets with exposed {001} facets have been recently reported by Xiang et al.117 using the hydrothermally prepared TiO2 nanosheets as a precursor and thiourea as a dopant. Surprisingly, pure TiO2 nanosheets showed visible light photocatalytic activity for the degradation of 4-chlorophenol (4-CP), which might be attributed to the substrate–surface complexation of TiO2 and 4-CP leading to extended absorption of TiO2 through ligand-to-titanium charge transfer as illustrated in Fig. 46a and b. Meanwhile, the XPS analysis revealed that N and S atoms were incorporated into the TiO2 lattice via interstitial N-doping and cationic substitution-type S-doping. In comparison to the bulk TiO2, the N–S/TiO2 nanocomposites exhibited two prominent features: (1) the appearance of a new absorption shoulder around 390–500 nm due to the introduction of some localized states near the VB edge by N-doping and (2) the enhanced absorbance in the range of 550–750 nm as a result of the synergistic effect of N and S co-doping. This hypothesis was further proven by DFT calculations, confirming that the N and S co-dopants induced the formation of new energy levels in the band gap for the red shift of absorption edges as exemplified in Fig. 46c–f. Therefore, this study provides new physical chemical insight into the enhancement mechanism of visible light photocatalytic activity.

More recently, Shi et al.299 successfully synthesized nano-sized N and S co-doped TiO2 nanocrystals with a high percentage of {001} facets and a large surface area via a solvothermal process using TiF4, tert-butanol and thiourea as precursors. The TEM images revealed that the side length and thickness of their as-synthesized N–S/TiO2 nanocrystals were found to be smaller than those developed by Xiang et al.,117 signifying that replacement of the hydrothermal process with the solvothermal process would aid in fabricating smaller crystallite sizes due to the smoother reaction and the potential directional effect of alcohols.154 Thus, the smaller particle size and larger surface area in addition to anion doping would be ideal for the efficient contact of photocatalysts with contaminants under visible light illumination.
Other than N–F and N–S co-dopants, it has been reported that the carbon and nitrogen (C–N) co-doped TiO2 nanoparticles demonstrated excellent photocatalytic properties under visible light on account of the synergistic effect of doped C and N atoms.53,300–302 Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that the carbon and nitrogen co-doped TiO2 nanosheets with preferential {001} facets exhibit a significant enhancement in visible light photocatalytic activities. Very recently, Dai et al.303 developed C–N co-doped anatase TiO2 nanosheets with dominant {001} facets by solvothermal treatment of TiCN as titanium, carbon and nitrogen precursors in a mixed H2O2–HF ethanol solution. They highlighted that ethanol, which served as a capping agent, could adsorb onto the TiO2 surface during the solvothermal process due to its hydroxyl groups. As a result, this hindered the aggregation of TiO2 nanoparticles and thus promoted the formation of TiO2 nanocrystals. This fact was in good agreement with the previous reports noted by Xing et al.,304 Xiang and Yu305 and Xiang et al.114 In comparison with P25, C–N/TiO2 nanosheets showed a stronger visible light absorption shoulder around 400–550 nm, suggesting the formation of an impurity energy level within the band gap as a result of N-doping. A further enhancement in the absorption of visible light up to 800 nm was caused by the carbonate species in C–N/TiO2. The carbonaceous species formed by doped C atoms acted as a photosensitizer, which could excite and inject electrons into the CB of TiO2, and then the electrons were transferred to the photocatalyst surface for the reaction to occur in degrading MB. Therefore, the above features confirmed that the carbon and nitrogen elements were successfully in situ doped into the TiO2 lattice.
In addition to the co-doping of non-metal elements, a few studies have been reported for the multi-doping of metal and/or metal oxide to develop highly visible light efficient, selective and stable {001}-faceted TiO2 based photocatalysts. Lately, development of TiO2 coupled with low band gap semiconductor photocatalysts and noble metal has become a hot research area. Qi et al.306 have fabricated cadmium sulfide (CdS)-sensitized Pt/TiO2 nanosheets with exposed {001} facets by a three-step procedure, involving (1) hydrothermal treatment of a TBOT–HF–H2O mixed solution to prepare TiO2 nanosheets, (2) photochemical reduction deposition of Pt on TiO2 nanosheets, and (3) chemical bath deposition (CBD) of CdS quantum dots on Pt/TiO2 nanosheets. CdS, which functioned as a sensitizer of TiO2 photocatalysts, was promising due to its low band gap (2.25 eV for the bulk material) and also sufficiently negative flat band potential.307 Because of its adequately negative flat band potential, the higher CB edge of CdS than TiO2 is beneficial for the injection of excited electrons from CdS to TiO2 under visible light as depicted in Fig. 47a. More importantly, in the presence of Pt, the excited electrons could be freely migrated to Pt and then reacted with the adsorbed H+ ions to form H2. This is ascribed to the higher work functions of Pt (5.6 eV) than that of TiO2 (∼3.9 eV), thus allowing the formation of Schottky barriers between TiO2 and Pt as confirmed by Könenkamp.308

As mentioned earlier, magnetic separation has been an alternative option to recover the photocatalysts after the reaction. Recently, magnetic separable photocatalysts with a magnetically responsive core and catalytic shell have gained much attention due to their exceptional capability to be easily separated. This makes it possible to realize the ease of recycling the catalyst materials. In particular, Shen et al.309 have demonstrated a sandwich-structured Fe3O4/SiO2/Au/TiO2 (MG/TiO2) photocatalyst, which exhibited magnetic separability, selective absorption and high photocatalytic activity in catalyzing the decomposition of organic compounds under visible light and simulated sunlight irradiation. The as-prepared photocatalyst had a SiO2-coated Fe3O4 core, a layer of polyelectrolyte film with in situ grown Au nanoparticles and finally a TiO2 nanocrystalline shell with exposed {001} facets as shown in Fig. 47b. A series of reactions was carried out to coat Fe3O4 particles with SiO2 and Au nanoparticles such as by combining the versatile sol–gel process, electrostatic layer-by-layer self-assembly and interfacial growth synthesis, and finally introducing TiO2 layers via the hydrothermal process. As expected from UV-Vis results, another absorption band at around 500 nm appeared due to the presence of Au nanoparticles, which could be caused by the SPR of small Au nanoparticles (<10 nm) as described in Section 3.2.
Although mono-doping of metal or non-metal can effectively enhance visible light photocatalytic activity, several experimental studies have verified that mono-doping will reduce the photogenerated current considering that the partially occupied impurity bands can act as recombination centers of electrons and holes inside the TiO2 crystals.276,277 As a result, it will go against the mobility of light-induced charge carriers to the surface for photocatalysis.310,311 Therefore, to surmount the problem, it has been recognized that co-doped TiO2 with both non-metal anions and metal cations could not only effectively improve the visible light absorption, but also reduce the recombination rate of photoinduced charge carriers. This is because co-doping can passivate the defect bands produced by mono-doping in order to prevent them from being recombination centers.312 For example, Zhang et al.112 reported a one-step route to Mo + N co-doped TiO2 sheets with dominant {001} facets by a hydrothermal process using TiN, MoO3, HF and HNO3 as precursors at 180 °C for 24 h. To confirm Mo and N doping into the TiO2 lattice, it has been found that both Mo and N doping enlarged the Bragg spacing along the [101] direction based on the XRD results. Also, in comparison with N-doped TiO2 sheets, Mo + N co-doped TiO2 sheets could absorb visible light due to the red shift in the absorption edges despite the elevation of the CB edge due to Mo doping, and thus expanded the band gap of TiO2 slightly. Although a slight elevation of the CB edge resulted in less use of visible light, the ability of reducing H+ would be significantly enhanced. Besides preventing the decrease of the reducing potential of water, the authors claimed that the purpose of incorporating Mo doping was to reduce the recombination centers caused by N-doping. This work highlights the key importance of rational design of co-doped anatase TiO2 nanosheets with dominant {001} facets towards photocatalytic applications.
In another paper, Zhang et al.111 successfully co-doped non-metal anion N and metal cation Ni into the anatase TiO2 lattice with exposed {001} facets through a two-step hydrothermal reaction with controllable crystal size in a narrow range of 5–15 nm. The key synthesis process was proposed as follows: (1) when P25 nanoparticles were treated with NaOH aqueous solution, some Ti–O–Ti bonds were broken and Ti–O–Na bonds were formed (eqn (28)), (2) after the prepared materials were washed with HCl aqueous solution and distilled water, the Ti–O–Na bonds would react with acid and water to form the new Ti–O–H bonds, and the H2Ti3O7 nanotubes were obtained (eqn (29)), (3) since H2Ti3O7 was a metastable phase, it could convert to TiO2 nanotubes easily at low temperature (eqn (30)), and (4) when both Ni2+ and NH4+ appeared in the NaOH aqueous solution, Na+ ions would be substituted in the hydrothermal reaction partially. Thus, the localized states associated with Ni and N dopants were produced in the TiO2 nanocrystals in the second hydrothermal reaction. Morphological changes from the H2Ti3O7 nanotube to anatase TiO2 nanosheets with exposed {001} facets were studied using TEM as depicted in Fig. 48a–c. The process was as follows: (1) after 2 h hydrothermal reaction, the H2Ti3O7 nanotube (Fig. 48a) transformed into an irregular hollow spherical structure (Fig. 48b) because of dehydration and (2) as the reaction continued, the isotropic growth was promoted along the [010] and [100] axes due to the surfaces surrounded by F− ions, resulting in the formation of Ni + N co-doped {001}-faceted TiO2 (Fig. 48c). The as-synthesized nanocrystal exhibited strong absorption in the visible light range from 400 to 500 nm and its band gap was narrowed to 2.9 eV due to the N and Ni dopants. For the N dopant, the energy levels associated with N 2p electrons were higher than those of O 2p at the VB maximum leading to a reduction in band gap energy. Similar findings have also been widely reported by Mitoraj and Kisch,313 Etacheri et al.,314 Spadavecchia et al.315 and Wang et al.53 When an Ni atom was used to substitute for Ti in TiO2, the largest perturbation occurred at the CB minimum energy. Consequently, the electron transition energy from the VB to the CB showed a decrease of about 1.2 eV as illustrated in Fig. 48d and e, which induced a red shift on the optical absorption edge. Therefore, the theoretical calculations and experimental results have indicated a significantly enhanced visible light absorption in the Ni + N co-doped TiO2 nanocrystals. (28) Na2Ti3O7 + HCl → H2Ti3O7(29) (30)

Besides that, nano-sized and highly dispersed carbon and lanthanum (La) co-doped TiO2 crystals with exposed {001} facets were developed by Xing et al.304 using glucose as the carbon doping source and {001}-facet controlling agent through a simple one-step hydrothermal process. This is considered a green synthesis route as no fluoride controlling agent was used during the synthesis process. The TiO2 particle size was greatly decreased due to the carbon and La co-doping, which could be attributed to the lattice deformation associated with oxygen vacancies in the anatase TiO2 crystallites caused by the doping elements, and thus hindering the crystallite growth. In the process of TiO2 nanocrystal formation, an aqueous solution of Ti(SO4)2 was equivalent to an aqueous solution of H2SO4 due to its strong acid radical of SO42− causing a very low pH, which gave rise to a desirable environment to generate nanocrystals. During the nanocrystal transformation in the absence of fluorides, abundant organic carbon was provided by employing glucose as the carbon source. Therefore, glucose could be considered as an alcohol and acted as a crystal growth directing agent due to its many hydroxyl groups. These hydroxyl groups surrounded the nanocrystal and adsorbed onto the {001} surfaces to generate small nano-seeds with exposed {001} facets during the hydrothermal process.303,305 Consequently, this hindered the aggregation of nanoparticles, simulated its preferred growth and maximized the exposure of {001} facets as summarized in Fig. 49. Meanwhile, the C–La/TiO2 nanocrystals showed a long tail absorption in the visible light region attributed to the co-doping-induced defects. Not only that, the reduction of glucose during the hydrothermal process led to carbonaceous species embedded in the TiO2 matrix, resulting in the formation of new active sites for the enhancement in photocatalytic activity under visible light. Evidently, the 2p states of the surface oxygen atoms on the {001} facets were destabilized and became very reactive, indicating more oxygen vacancies present on the {001} facets. These defects caused by oxygen vacancies can therefore act as activation centers in the photocatalysis process for the excellent photocatalytic performance.

Direct precipitation of modified-TiO2 with {001} facets on various conductive substrates such as metallic Ti is also of particular interest for applications in photocatalysis since this avoids the unnecessary procedure of catalyst recovery after reaction. Wu and Tang83 reported the hydrothermal growth of a novel anatase TiO2 microsphere co-doped with nitrogen, fluorine and chromium, which exposed nearly all-{001} facets. The catalysts were synthesized by hydrothermal treatment of a thermal sprayed TiN/Ti coating with HF aqueous solution containing chromium powders. The {001}-exposed anatase TiO2 crystals reported by researchers hitherto are highly truncated bipyramids without exception.77,87,139,157,185 Surprisingly, the crystal achieved using this novel synthesis approach was drum-like with a perfect round cross-section, in which two parallel surfaces of which were high energy {001} facets. The formation of the drum-like crystals was ascribed to a balance between the erosion and precipitation of anatase TiO2 single crystallites. It was believed that the erosion was enhanced by the surface deficiency arising from the Cr doping. What is of more interest is that the anatase TiO2 microspheres produced from the one-pot synthesis exhibited significantly enhanced solar absorption, which were responsive to light covering nearly the whole visible light region. Overall, the discovery of the multi-doped {001}-faceted TiO2 with metal, metal oxide or non-metal elements could shed new light on the design and synthesis of novel semiconductor materials with enhanced visible light absorption for the environmentally relevant photocatalytic decontamination and energy conversion processes.
3.5. Incorporation of graphene as a catalyst support in {001}-faceted TiO2 system
To make the {001}-exposed TiO2-based photocatalysts visible light responsive, various titanium sources such as TiN, TiS2, TiC and so forth have been applied to prepare non-metal doped TiO2 with dominating {001} facets, as discussed in Sections 3.3 and 3.4. Nevertheless, the rapid recombination rate of electron–hole pairs (an intrinsic drawback) is improved in the TiO2 with {001} facets. To further prolong the average lifetime of charge carriers, a favorable conductive substrate to overcome the barrier is urgently demanded. Carbonaceous materials such as activated carbon, carbon nanotubes, fullerenes, graphene and their derivatives have been proven to be effective supports to couple with photoactive nanomaterials to further suppress the recombination of the photogenerated electron–hole pairs. Among all the carbon nanomaterials described above, waltzing with graphene in the synthesis of graphene-based nanoassemblies has recently become one of the most exciting topics of research in numerous fields of photocatalysis. Recent years have witnessed a cornucopia of strategies towards the exploration of graphene which could eventually advance the rational fabrication of smart graphene-based nanocomposites for photocatalysis in the near future. It is believed that the integration of TiO2 nanocrystals with controlled {001} crystal facets and graphene sheets is expected to be more reactive and also serves as an ideal high performance candidate in photocatalytic applications. This efficient hybrid system opens up a new promising avenue for the further development of photocatalysis, which has been reported by a number of studies.316–318
Sun et al.48 fabricated nano-sized anatase TiO2 sheets with {001} facets dominant on the platform of graphene sheets via a facile solvothermal route using HF as the morphology controlling agent (Fig. 50a, c and d). In their synthesis protocol, ethanol was selected to promote the stabilization of the {001} facet of TiO2 and also the dispersion of graphene oxide (GO). Considering that GO constitutes abundant oxygen functional groups such as hydroxyl, TBOT can be readily grafted on the GO surfaces through chemisorption at the molecular level. Therefore, adequate ultrasonic treatment allowed the uniform dispersion of TBOT in the GO suspension in order to react well with the functional groups on the GO surfaces as shown in Fig. 50b. It is noted that the quasi-square TiO2 nanocrystals gradually formed with increasing time through the inter- or intra-particle Ostwald ripening process. Moreover, the crystallinity of the graphene/TiO2 with {001} facets was increased with reaction time, confirming that Ostwald ripening was a fundamental mechanism growing process for the formation of TiO2 nanosheets. On top of that, the incorporation of graphene sheets induced a higher visible light absorption intensity than the bare TiO2 nanosheets, exemplifying an obvious red shift in the absorption edge of graphene/TiO2 with {001} facets (Fig. 50e). As a result, more effective utilization of the solar spectrum could be attained. It is expected that such a unique structure and advanced chemical constitution will be beneficial in environmental remediation and energy-related applications.

Besides that, a microwave-hydrothermal method for the design of highly active graphene-modified TiO2 nanosheet photocatalysts has been successfully developed by Xiang et al.319 The modern microwave systems possess the capabilities of time and temperature programming, allowing fast and easy optimization of experimental conditions, as discussed in Section 2.1. Firstly, they prepared the anatase TiO2 nanosheets with exposed {001} facets using HF as the capping agent. Then they incorporated the as-prepared TiO2 nanosheets with GO sheets to form graphene/TiO2 nanosheets in a two-step process. In another report, Liu et al.316 synthesized chemically bonded {001} facet-exposed TiO2/graphene sheet composites via a one-step hydrothermal reaction of monolayer GO and HF. The whole hydrothermal process could be exemplified in Fig. 51a. Due to the interaction between the hydrophilic functional groups (–OH and –COOH) on the GO surface and the hydroxyl groups on nanocrystalline TiO2, the direct formation of Ti–C and Ti–O–C bonds would ensure more compact connection between TiO2 and graphene sheets and not easy to flake off. As a result, this leads to the formation of well-distributed {001}-faceted TiO2 on the graphene sheets (Fig. 51b). TEM images revealed the development of well-faceted nanocrystals with uniform particle size of 10–15 nm and various shapes including square, hexagon and truncated rhombus as depicted in Fig. 51c. They highlighted that the different morphologies might be due to the highly truncated octahedral bipyramidal structure with HF as a morphology controlling agent. Furthermore, an obvious red shift of the absorption edge due to enhanced visible light absorption in the TiO2/graphene sheet composites could be observed in comparison with P25, indicating the narrowing of the band gap of TiO2 occurred with the addition of graphene. Upon visible light absorption in the graphene/TiO2 system, the excited electrons of TiO2 could transfer from the CB to graphene via a percolation mechanism. Indeed, the Schottky barrier formed at the interface between TiO2 and graphene results in the effective charge separation to suppress the charge recombination.

Although some mechanisms have been proposed to elucidate the interaction between TiO2 and carbon materials, the collective power of associated research on the interaction and electron transfer process in the nanocomposites is still not strong enough due to the lack of adequate evidence. Thus, Jiang et al.320 have provided deeper insights into the electron transfer mechanisms of TiO2/graphene composites (TGCS) with exposed {001} facets by studying and conducting various characterizations such as XPS and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). They presented a feasible strategy to synthesize the TGCS with reactive {001} facets by the HF and methanol joint assisted solvothermal reactions. In their work, methanol was selected as the solvent to substitute water, which was in favor of the slow hydrolysis of TBOT. The TEM images revealed that graphene was uniformly covered with a large number of anatase TiO2 nanoparticles (20–25 nm) without obvious aggregation (Fig. 52a) relative to the pure high reactive TiO2 (HR-TiO2) nanoparticles from the solvothermal method. Hence, this proves that graphene inhibits the aggregation of TiO2 nanoparticles. Similar observations for the role of graphene in nanocomposites were also reported by Wang et al.98 The XPS measurements exhibited strong interactions between TiO2 and graphene, whereas the XAS evidenced the transfer of electrons from TiO2 to graphene to improve the charge separation rate of TiO2. More importantly, the SPV results demonstrated that once the TiO2 was excited, the photoinduced electrons will be transferred to graphene, leaving the holes in TiO2, which was proven by the positive signal (TGCS-1) of photovoltaic response (Fig. 52b). Apart from the SPV response, the transient photovoltage (TPV) spectrum of the composites (TGCS-1) confirmed the prolonged mean lifetime of the electron–hole pairs with respect to HR-TiO2 (Fig. 52c), which greatly retarded the recombination of the charge carriers in the excited TiO2 by incorporating graphene with TiO2.

Very recently, Wang et al.318 reported a novel hybrid composite by in situ growing ultrathin anatase TiO2 nanosheets with dominating high energy {001} facets on the graphene sheets through a one-pot solvothermal synthesis route. Fig. 53a shows the overall fabrication procedures for uniform TiO2 nanosheets decorated on graphene sheets. Briefly, GO was dispersed in 1-butanol serving as the template, proceeding with the self-assembly of the Ti4+ precursor onto GO sheets via chemical bonds. The relative ease of Ti4+ grafted on the GO surfaces was owing to abundant oxygen functional groups on the GO surfaces, which was found to be more conducive for the formation of the {001} facets. Furthermore, both HF and 1-butanol were selected to act as protective capping agents to promote the stabilization of the {001} facets. They claimed that pure TiO2 sheets were much thicker than TiO2 nanosheets in graphene/TiO2 composites, and also pure TiO2 sheet dimensions were smaller than TiO2 nanosheets in graphene/TiO2 composites, suggesting that graphene sheets acted as the template for the crystal growth of large ultrathin TiO2 nanosheets. Meanwhile, a wide background absorption in the visible light region was observed for graphene/TiO2 composites (Fig. 53b), which was ascribed to the presence of carbon in the composites, and thereby reducing reflection of light. Similarly, the interaction between C and Ti atoms on the surface during solvothermal treatment resulted in strong absorption in the visible light range and a red shift in the absorption edge for graphene/TiO2 composites in comparison to pure TiO2. Their findings will provide new opportunities for graphene as a protective material and template not only for TiO2 nanosheets, but also for other semiconductors to search for potential applications in photocatalysis.

The aforementioned studies on the synthesis of graphene/TiO2 with controlled {001} facets were carried out with the use of HF as the morphology controlling agent. However, as discussed earlier in the previous section, HF imposes hazardous and detrimental effects on the environment. Therefore, to avoid the direct use and handling of harmful HF, Wang et al.98 reported a simple way to develop graphene/TiO2 nanocomposites with controlled crystal facets through one-pot hydrothermal treatment. They employed GO and (NH4)2TiF6 as the starting materials. As reported by Jiang et al.,320 the presence of GO in the precursor solutions played an important role in preventing agglomeration of TiO2 nanocrystals. The hydrolysis process of (NH4)2TiF6 produced F− ions, which could preferentially adsorb on the {001} facets of TiO2 nanocrystals and thus limit the growth along the c-axis. At the initial stage of the hydrolysis process, [Ti(OH)nF6−n]2− was formed (eqn (31)), which later transformed to TiO2 nuclei (eqn (32)). TiO2 nuclei gradually grew to form TiO2 nanocrystals. Due to the limitation on the crystal growth along the c-axis, the TiO2 nanocrystals grew perpendicular to the c-axis. Owing to this, as the hydrothermal duration increased, the {100} facets of TiO2 progressively disappeared and transformed to the stable {101} facets, and its morphologies changed from nanocuboids (enclosed by two {001} facets and four {100} facets) to truncated octahedrons (enclosed by two {001} and eight {101} facets). [TiF6]2− + nH2O ⇌ [Ti(OH)nF6−n]2− + nHF(31) [Ti(OH)6]2− + 2H+ → TiO2 + 4H2O(32)
Last but not least, a unique hybrid structure by directly growing ultrathin anatase TiO2 nanosheets with exclusive {001} facets onto a graphene support was developed by Ding et al.321 They employed 2-propanol and DETA as synergistic capping agents for the formation of {001} facets of TiO2 nanosheets. The typical synthesis procedure of graphene-supported anatase TiO2 nanosheets was carried out as follows: (1) solvothermal treatment for the growth of TiO2 nanosheets on GO in the presence of 2-propanol and DETA and (2) thermal treatment to reduce GO to graphene under a N2/H2 atmosphere.
In short, it is undoubted that the discovery of graphene and the incorporation of TiO2-based photocatalysts with exposed {001} facets as a whole could serve as a new family member of promising photocatalysts. All their investigations open up a new doorway for the exploration and development of stable graphene/TiO2 composite materials as photocatalysts, which would further enrich the huge potential applications to the role of graphene in photocatalysis as well as to harness the solar light as an infinite energy resource. As indicated in the editorials published in Nature,322 graphene is not a miracle material; just a very promising one and it will take restraint and sustained interest to deliver its potential. Therefore, it is strongly believed that this would bring golden opportunities for science and technology especially in photocatalysis to achieve more effective and efficient next generation photocatalysts.
4. Summary and outlook
Over the past decades, the tremendous amount of effort devoted to TiO2-based composites has resulted in a rich database for their synthesis, characterization, modification and wide application. The continuing breakthroughs in the synthesis and modification of TiO2 composites have certainly brought new fascinating properties with enhanced performance. Accompanied by the current progress in the design of TiO2-based crystals are the new research directions towards engineering of highly reactive {001} facets. This article presents the state-of-the-art technologies and latest advancements in novel synthesis strategies to achieve high energy {001}-faceted anatase TiO2-based composites. In-depth understanding of the morphology control of single crystals plays a crucial role in the fabrication of high quality materials with well-defined surface properties. We have critically reviewed the synthesis chemistries involved in the development of anatase TiO2 with highly reactive {001} facets based on first-principles calculations predicting the thermodynamically stable crystal morphologies. The selective adhesion of specific capping agents (the most typical being fluoride) on the {001} surface of anatase TiO2 is essential for the stabilization of high energy {001} facets. However, fluorine-containing compounds are extremely toxic and corrosive. Therefore, we have also provided a comprehensive discussion on the use of fluorine-free containing species in the manipulation of crystal morphology.
Since the pioneering work of Yang et al.,95 most of the research studies have been focused on the development of various synthesis routes to prepare pure anatase TiO2 crystals with small particle sizes and high percentages of exposed {001} facets. It was found that the degree of truncation and particle sizes can be controlled to some extent by selecting the appropriate TiO2 precursor, capping agent, solvent and other reaction conditions. In addition to the most commonly employed wet-chemistry methods, solid-state and chemical vapor routes have also been developed to synthesize anatase TiO2 with dominant {001} facets. As a result, the percentage of {001} facets exposed can now approach 100% and the thickness of anatase TiO2 crystals achievable thus far is as thin as 1.6 nm. The extraordinary geometrical and electronic properties associated with {001} facets are primary roles for the separation and transfer of charge carriers in photocatalytic redox processes, being a consequence of favored dissociative adsorption and spatial separation of redox sites. In general, the {001} facets on the TiO2 crystals are widely accepted to be advantageous for photocatalysis, photovoltaic and lithium ion batteries, and demonstrations of enhanced activity have been reported abundantly.80,82,86,92,112,255,323,324 However, contributions from other co-existing facets and surface variables must not be disregarded. There is some consensus about the synergetic effect between {001} facets and other surface states such as {101} facets and/or surface-adsorbed fluorine in the photoredox reactivity of anatase TiO2. As highlighted in this article, adjacent facets have collaborative effects in separating photoinduced electron–hole pairs. Hence, it is important to note that all these variables are interrelated and should not be considered individually in explaining the variation in the photocatalytic reaction route by the presence of {001} facets.
Despite the huge development in theoretical predictions as well as experimental results involving {001} facet-dominated anatase TiO2, studies in this field are still in preliminary stages and many challenges exist in several aspects. Firstly, it is difficult to assemble anatase TiO2 nanosheets into well-organized compact film photoanodes without sacrificing the reactive {001} facets in order to improve the electrochemical systems. Moreover, most synthesis strategies involve the use of morphology-controlling agents that must eventually be removed in order to obtain clean facets. This process might lead to some uncontrollable changes to the surface atomic structure of the TiO2 crystal. In this respect, the detailed examination of possible reconstruction of high energy facets is crucial in the future and the development of a novel synthesis method to prevent this occurrence is highly desirable. More importantly, the use of organic surfactants in the preparation process can remarkably alter the free energy of the surface and interfacial properties of the TiO2 crystal. However, the selection of surfactant still remains empirical due to the lack of in-depth knowledge of selective surface-adsorption energies on the TiO2 nanocrystal itself.
Furthermore, many stable TiO2 composites with exposed {001} facets are only excited under UV light. They suffer from weak visible light absorption and a high recombination rate of photoexcited charge carriers. To obtain a substantial breakthrough in efficiency for advanced applications such as photocatalysis, photovoltaic and solar energy conversion, additional efforts are necessary for the development of more complex nanostructures. Extensive studies have been devoted to the modification of anatase TiO2 with exposed {001} facets. Doping and heterostructuring are generally believed to enhance the transfer of interfacial charge carriers by constructing favorable interfaces with various facets from different crystals. However, the performance of the current photocatalysts is still far from satisfactory in terms of efficiency and stability and there are several breakthroughs to be made before it can be considered as an economically viable process for commercial benefits. Rational design of complex heterostructures, which can simultaneously facilitate optical absorption, charge carrier separation, migration and utilization, is central for a next generation of highly efficient and robust photocatalysts. Significant challenges still remain in the design of such complex heterostructures coupled with well-defined architectures and also optimized charge cascading processes. To accomplish this, it is vital to have a detailed mechanistic understanding of the surface/interface processes at the atomic level. A fundamental understanding of the charge transfer process in the heterostructure composites is of utmost significance for the optimization of the charge cascading process in order to maximize the utilization of photoinduced electron–hole pairs for desirable redox chemistry. In situ observations are essential to acquire a true picture of the catalyst surfaces in action. For example, we would need a clearer understanding of the interactions between the reactant molecules and the crystallographic facets for the optimization of the photocatalytic reactions and DSSCs. This will be the main task in the years to come. The interrelationship among the primary factors in crystal growth, doping and heterostructuring of highly reactive {001}-faceted TiO2 composites is summarized in Fig. 54.

Next, the stability of {001}-faceted anatase TiO2 crystals is and will be one of the main challenges for the development of photocatalysts. A photocatalyst with high efficiency is still redundant if the lifetime of the catalyst is too short. For most photocatalytic systems, the photodegradation and chemical corrosion of the photocatalyst are difficult to avoid. To date, a few examples of extended photocatalyst stability have been reported, which however often requires highly complex synthesis processes. Therefore, the development of a novel synthesis route which could ultimately lead to a stable photocatalytic system with high efficiency is urgently required to realize practicality in commercial applications for the near future.
Research and discovery opportunities exist for anatase TiO2-based photoactive composites with exposed {001} facets. The ability to tailor and synthesize large amounts of homogeneous catalysts and further research into their catalytic activities and standardization is necessary. Also, the understanding and controlling of the synthesis process will be the key to further breakthroughs in this emerging front of research. Furthermore, applications of the aforementioned structures as catalyst supports, host materials and gas sensors for biomolecules are still inadequately explored. Thus, we hope that this critical review will stimulate more examination on the development and thorough characterization of {001}-faceted anatase TiO2-based composites and advance their application for resolving the current and future environmental and energy-related issues. With the full exploration and reasonable design of crystal facet engineering of TiO2-based crystals, the applications of TiO2-based composites for conversion of solar (UV or visible light) to chemical energy and for energy storage would undoubtedly be enriched in a more rational way. The intense and rational efforts from the union between academia and industry would open a revolution of clean and renewable energy, in which we believe that the goals of realizing a pollution-free environment and addressing the crisis of energy shortages via alternative clean energy supplies using green technology are not merely a dream and instead, it will certainly be far beyond what has been reported in this critical review.

 	Fig. 1  Evolution of an anatase TiO2 crystal nucleus nucleated as a truncated octahedral bipyramid seed: (a) under equilibrium conditions, the high energy {001} facets diminish rapidly and the crystal evolves into thermodynamically stable {101} facets. (b and c) Under non-equilibrium conditions, the high energy {001} and {010} facets are stabilized by selective adhesion of capping agents. The side lengths labelled as (A) and (B) are used to estimate the degree of truncation (B/A) and also calculate the percentage of exposed {001} facets.
