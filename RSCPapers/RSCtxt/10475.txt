    , Accepted 16th August 2021First published on 16th August 2021AbstractLow-dimensional metal halides have attracted much attention because of their excellent physical properties and potential application in optoelectronic field. Herein, we developed a novel facile method based on mechanochemical synthesis to prepare one-dimensional (1D) C4H14N2PbBr4 (C4H14N22+: N,N′-dimethylethylenediamine cation) micro-crystals on a large scale. This 1D structure enables the formation of self-trapped excited states that exhibit bluish white-light emission, and the photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) is about 18.4% under excitation of a 365 nm ultraviolet (UV) lamp. Interestingly, C4H14N2PbBr4 exhibits an unusual bistable emission, i.e., when excited by a 365 nm beam from a UV lamp, its emission occurs at about 461 nm, while excited by a 365 nm laser pulse, its emission maximum is located at 546 nm. The formation of self-trapped exciton (STE) pairs (bipolaron) via coupling of two adjacent PbBr42− clusters by di-amine groups results in the bistable emission in the 1D chain. It is worth mentioning that the as-synthesized C4H14N2PbBr4 has the advantages of high chemical, thermal and photostability, and large-scale manufacture along with remarkable photophysical properties, which provide a broad prospect for optoelectronic applications.
1. Introduction
Organic–inorganic hybrid metal halides (OIHMHs) have drawn tremendous attention due to their outstanding optoelectronic properties such as high luminescence efficiencies with multi-dimensional tunability, low trap-state density, high charge carrier mobility, and substantial charge carrier diffusion lengths.1–3 All these excellent properties laid the foundation for OIHMH use in photophysical applications, such as, solar cells, photodetectors, and light-emitting diodes (LED),4–6 which can work in different wavelength ranges and have structural flexibility by introducing different organic cations. One momentous scientific achievement in this field over the past few years is the effective control of the dimensionality of semiconducting materials, lead halide OIHMHs, and the dimensionality of such ionic materials could be tuned at the molecular level by introducing a variety of multifunctional organic ligands into metal halide components to prepare OIHMHs with 0D, 1D and 2D structures.7–11
Low-dimensional OIHMHs, also considered as the derivatives of traditional 3D ABX3 perovskites, have become a new type of functional material with unique optical and electronic properties tremendously different from 3D perovskites.12,13 For instance, Zhou et al. reported 0D (bmpy)9[ZnCl4]2[Pb3Cl11] with a near-unity PLQY.14 Yang et al. successfully synthesized 1D [(AD)Pb2Cl5] micro-belts with high water stability.15 Mao et al. obtained 2D α-(MEN)PbBr4 with a broadband white emission.16 In the studies cited above, these low-dimensional OIHMHs display strong structural distortion related to remarkable quantum confinement effects, resulting in the formation of excited states of free excitons (FEs) and STEs under photoexcitation.17–19 Consequently, a broad emission band with large Stokes shifts can be obtained, and the possibility of single-component white light emission can be realized. In particular, the photophysical properties of low-dimensional OIHMHs show great tunability via designing the chemical composition and dimensionality.20–23 Thus, low-dimensional OIHMHs have gained tremendous interest in the field of optoelectronics.
To date, many novel low-dimensional OIHMHs with excellent properties have been developed, and researchers are more concerned about the effect of different organic cations in the chemical composition on the photoelectric properties of OIHMHs. For example, Lin et al. found 0D (C13H19N4)2PbBr4 with efficient blue emission,24 Yuan et al. synthesized a 1D-chain C4H14N2PbBr4 single crystal (SC) with bluish white-light emission,18 Yang et al. reported a series of mixed-halide 2D-layered (C6H5C2H4NH3)2PbBrxCl4−x with high color rendering index white-light emission.25 However, to achieve the industrial application of OIHMHs, the requirements are not only excellent optoelectronic properties, but also low manufacturing costs. Thus, it is urgent to develop a large-scale facile-synthesis method to produce high-quality OIHMHs with high-efficiency emission at room temperature. In this work, based on the work of Ma research group,18 we developed a novel synthesis method with low cost based on mechanochemistry to overcome the above-mentioned issues and successfully prepared 1D OIHMH C4H14N2PbBr4 crystals with bluish white-light emission. Moreover, the as-synthesized C4H14N2PbBr4 crystals show an unusual bistable emission, i.e., when excited by a 365 nm beam from a UV lamp, its emission occurs at about 461 nm, while excited by a 365 nm laser pulse, its emission maximum is located at 546 nm. Subsequently, this unique optical phenomenon, related emission mechanism and the stability of C4H14N2PbBr4 crystals are systematically studied. All of these show that the C4H14N2PbBr4 powder crystals are suitable for practical use as a phosphor in LED for optoelectronic applications.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Chemicals and reagents
Lead bromide (PbBr2, ≥99%), N,N′-dimethylethylenediamine (C4H12N2, >97%), HBr (48 wt% in water), dimethyl formamide (DMF, analytical grade, 99.9%), and ethanol (analytical grade, 99.9%) were purchased from Innochem. All salts and solvents were used as received.
2.2 Synthesis

2.2.1 Synthesis of C4H14N2Br2. 
C4H14N2Br2 was synthesized by reacting C4H12N2 and HBr in a molar ratio of 1.3:1 in an iced bath for 3 h, and the resulting solution was evaporated at 50 °C in a rotary evaporator for about 2.5 h. White C4H14N2Br2 was collected by Büchner funnel filtration after washing three times with ethanol and then drying at 60 °C for 12 h.


2.2.2 Synthesis of C4H14N2PbBr4 crystals. 
The crystal of C4H14N2PbBr4 was prepared by three different methods, and the relevant schematic diagram is shown in Fig. 1. For the first method (Sample 1), 0.551 g PbBr2 (1.5 mmol) was fully dissolved in 15 mL 48 wt% HBr aqueous solution at 80 °C to form a bright transparent solution. The same molar ratio of solid C4H14N2Br2 (1.5 mmol, 0.375 g) was added to the bright transparent solution initially causing the precipitation of white floccules, which subsequently dissolved under heating the solution to boiling. In order to ensure the complete reaction, the magnetic stirring was continued at a temperature of 130 °C for 2 h. After that, the stirring was then discontinued, and the solution was left to cool to room temperature, during which time needle-like colorless bulk SCs (Fig. S1 and S2, ESI†) appeared in the bottom of the container. The precipitation was deemed to be complete after ∼6 h. The crystals were collected by filtration and thoroughly dried under reduced pressure for further use. Yield 0.752 g (∼81.2%) and PLQY ∼15.2% ± 0.6%.
 Fig. 1  Schematic of the crystal synthesis for C4H14N2PbBr4. 
For the second method (Sample 2), 0.551 g PbBr2 (1.5 mmol) and 0.375 g C4H14N2Br2 (1.5 mmol) were dissolved in 15 mL DMF solution at room temperature, respectively, and a bright transparent solution was formed under magnetic stirring. Subsequently, the above two bright transparent solutions were mixed together. After about 1 minute, the mixed solution gradually became cloudy accompanied by the formation of colorless micro-crystals. At this time, the solution exhibited bright bluish white-light emission upon 365 nm UV excitation. The SCs were collected by filtration and thoroughly dried under reduced pressure for further use. Yield 0.772 g (∼83.4%) and PLQY ∼20.4 ± 0.4%.
The third method (Sample 3) is inspired by the second one, and combined with the modified-mechanochemical synthesis, and C4H14N2PbBr4 micro-crystals were successfully prepared again. Typically, 0.551 g PbBr2 (1.5 mmol) and 0.375 g C4H14N2Br2 (1.5 mmol) were put into an agate mortar, and then ground using a pestle for a while. Under the irradiation of a 365 nm UV lamp, it was found that the matter in the mortar did not emit light. However, when 1–2 mL of DMF was added to the mortar, the substance in the mortar will emit bright bluish white-light under the irradiation of 365 nm UV lamp. To ensure that the reaction fully proceeds, it is necessary to continue grinding for a period of time. The crystals were collected and thoroughly dried under reduced pressure for further use. Yield 0.918 g (∼100%) and PLQY ∼18.7% ± 0.9%.

2.3 Measurement and characterization
Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) analysis was performed using an Empyrean instrument in the 2θ range from 5° to 50°. The morphology and elemental analyses of the samples were measured using a field-emission scanning electron microscope (SEM, Zeiss Supra 55) equipped with an energy-dispersive spectrometer (EDS). The photoluminescence (PL) and photoluminescence excitation (PLE) spectra were recorded using a Gangdong F-380 instrument. Variable-dependent PL was measured by a 365 nm laser quipped with liquid nitrogen cooler. Time-resolved PL data were collected using an FLS980 instrument. The photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) was also obtained at room temperature using an Edinburgh FLS980 instrument. The Raman spectra were recorded using an Alpha 300R instrument with a CW 532 nm laser as an excitation source. Thermogravimetric (TG) measurements were done using a NETZSCH instrument in a nitrogen atmosphere.
2.4 Density functional theory (DFT) calculations
All calculations of C4H14N2PbBr4 were based on DFT implemented using the VASP software. The experimental lattice parameters of C4H14N2PbBr4 were used while the atomic positions were completely relaxed until the residual forces were less than 0.02 eV Å−1. Electronic band structures and density of states (DOS) were calculated using the hybrid Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional. In order to ensure convergence, the kinetic energy cutoff is 500 eV.
3. Results and discussion
In this work, we prepared C4H14N2PbBr4 crystals by three different methods, and it should be noted that Sample 3 can be extended to large-scale production above the gram level, and has the advantages of a simple method, high yield, better reproducibility, low-cost, etc., which lay a foundation for its application in industries. Fig. 2a shows the crystal structure of C4H14N2PbBr4, in which the metal halide chain PbBr42− was cinctured by insulating organic shells C4H14N22+ to form a bulk assembly of core–shell quantum wires (Fig. S3, ESI†).18Fig. 2b exhibits the PXRD patterns of all the samples. Clearly, the diffraction peaks of all the samples are consistent with the fitting results from the SC analysis and no other diffraction peaks are observed, indicating the high purity of all the samples. In addition, the highly oriented diffraction peaks indicate that all the samples have high crystalline quality. By comparing the PXRD patterns of three samples, we also note that the diffraction peaks of Sample 1 at 34.8° and 43.9° are stronger, while that of Sample 2 and Sample 3 are stronger at 15.8°, 19.9°, 24.4°, 29.3°, 31.2°, 38.4°, and 43.4°, which is caused by the different synthesis methods leading to different crystal orientations of the prepared samples. As Sample 2 and Sample 3 only use DMF in the preparation process, their diffraction peak intensity variation trend is basically consistent. Moreover, we also conducted PXRD measurements on Sample 3 before and after adding DMF (Fig. S4, ESI†), and found that Sample 3 had many miscellaneous diffraction peaks with weak intensity before adding DMF. However, after introducing a small amount of DMF, the diffraction peaks of Sample 3 become regular with high crystal orientation, which indicates that DMF can play a role in inducing crystallization in the preparation of C4H14N2PbBr4 crystals. In short, we prepared C4H14N2PbBr4 crystals with high purity and crystal quality by three different methods, which provides a strong basis for further measurements.

The SEM image of as-synthesized Sample 3 is presented in Fig. 3a. Clearly, the C4H14N2PbBr4 crystal of Sample 3 is a multi-faceted hexagonal platelet with a smooth surface morphology, which also illustrates that Sample 3 possesses a good crystal quality. The corresponding Sample 3 size distribution diagram is displayed in Fig. 3b, from which, one can see that Sample 3 has a relatively concentrated particle size distribution, with an average particle size of ∼2.27 μm. Moreover, we also performed the SEM measurement on Sample 2, and the results are shown in Fig. S5a (ESI†). The average particle size is 8.73 μm (Fig. S5b, ESI†), which is significantly higher than that of Sample 3. In order to identify the composition of Sample 3, the EDS measurement was carried out, as shown in Fig. 3c. From here, one can see that the atomic ratio of Pb and Br elements was determined to be 19.6:80.4 (1:4.1). Compared with the standard results (1:4), there is a slight deviation from the actual results due to the experimental errors during the measurement process and obvious discrepancy in the solution-based synthesis of materials.26 Further elemental mapping of Sample 3 (Fig. 3e and f) illustrates a relatively homogeneous distribution of Br and Pb. This also fully ensures the repeatability of the subsequent experimental results for all samples prepared by the third method.

We further investigated the optical properties of C4H14N2PbBr4 crystals. In the PLE spectra of all the samples (Fig. 4a), there are two distinct peaks in the UV range, which are located at ∼334 nm and ∼378 nm, respectively. Moreover, a shoulder peak is also presented at ∼355 nm. We found that although the PLE spectra are basically the same, there are some subtle differences, which may be caused by the difference in crystal sizes due to the different synthesis methods. Moreover, all the samples are colorless under daylight. All of these results further confirm the negligible absorbance in the visible range of C4H14N2PbBr4 crystals. Fig. 4b gives the emission spectra of all the samples excited by a 365 nm UV lamp and 365 nm laser in air atmosphere at room temperature, respectively. Under the excitation of 365 nm UV lamp, all samples have a distinct emission peak at ∼461 nm and a shoulder peak at ∼401 nm, and this shoulder peak becomes particularly noticeable in Sample 3. This may be attributed to the weaker self-absorption in Sample 3. Moreover, all the samples exhibit broadband emission, with a wide full width at half maximum (FWHM) of ∼141 nm (0.83 eV) and a large Stokes shift of ∼83 nm (0.59 eV), which is similar to the characteristics of the efficient yellow emission 1D OIHMH [DMEDA]PbCl4.27 Surprisingly, compared to the 365 nm UV lamp excitation, when all samples are excited by the 365 nm laser, the emission peak has a significant red shift (∼85 nm) with a maximum emission peak at 546 nm and a FWHM of 137 nm (0.58 eV). This is a novel and unique photophysical property, and we will discuss this phenomenon in detail later. In order to evaluate the quantitative emission change of C4H14N2PbBr4 excited by a 365 nm UV lamp and 365 nm laser, the Commission Internationale de l’Eclairage (CIE) chromaticity coordinates of the PL spectra were calculated (Fig. 4c); the chromaticity coordinates of all samples are almost the same (Fig. S6, ESI†), allowing visualization of the obvious color change from (0.241, 0.318) for the 365 nm UV lamp to (0.362, 0.438) for the 365 nm laser. Then, we measured the decay lifetime of all the samples (monitored at 546 nm) using a 365 nm ns laser. In Fig. 4d, these decay curves can be well fitted by monoexponential function with the fitting decay results of Sample 1, Sample 2 and Sample 3 as 36.1 ns, 38.5 ns and 35.2 ns, respectively. Although the PL decay lifetimes of the three samples are slightly different, they are still longer than the previously reported low-dimensional OIHMHs of α-(DMEN)PbBr4 (1.39 ns),16 (2meptH2)PbBr4 (2.33 ns),28 and C5H14N2PbCl4·H2O (5.60 ns)29 with STE emissions. Moreover, we measured the PL decay lifetime of Sample 3 at 10 W and 0.1 W, respectively (Fig. S7, ESI†). Clearly, one can see the PL decay lifetime of Sample 3 to be reduced by 4.0% at higher power, which is attributed to the generation of more carriers at a higher excitation power, and the interaction between carriers leads to the annihilation via bimolecular interaction, resulting in a shorter PL lifetime at high excitation.

(c) CIE chromaticity diagram of Sample 3 excited by a 365 nm UV lamp and 365 nm laser, respectively. (d) PL decay lifetime curves (monitored at 546 nm) of all the samples excited by a 365 nm laser. 
In further experiment, we probed the intrinsic nature of the emissions for C4H14N2PbBr4. We measured the wavelength-dependent PL and PLE spectra of Sample 3 (Fig. S8, ESI†), and found that the PL and PLE spectra have the identical profile at different emission and excitation wavelengths, respectively, illustrating that the broadband emission originated from the relaxation of the same excited state. Moreover, we also observed that the broadband emission shows a linear dependence on the excitation power density (Fig. S9, ESI†), excluding the emission that originates from permanent defects.30 Generally, STEs are caused by lattice distortion in excited states, which widely exists in semiconductor materials with soft lattice and strong electron–phonon coupling. Recently, a series of low-dimensional OIHMHs with features of broad emission band and large Stokes shift have been reported and assigned to STE emission. Similarly, the broadband emission of C4H14N2PbBr4 could be attributed to STE recombination, in which the local distortion of lattice should be the main cause of the large Stokes shift.31
In order to clarify the reason that 1D C4H14N2PbBr4 exhibits broadband emission, which was similar to other low-dimensional OIHMHs (e.g. C9H10N2PbCl4,32 (C7H12N2S)2[PbBr3],33 C4N2H14PbCl434), the band structures and DOS results were calculated based on DFT. It evidences that C4N2H14PbBr4 is a direct band gap of 2.79 eV at the Γ point (Fig. 5a), which is slightly smaller than the experimental result (3.15 eV, Fig. S10, ESI†). The same behavior can also be found in other semiconductors, which is mainly because the DFT calculation often underestimates the band gap values.30,35 As can be seen from the electron DOS (Fig. 5b), the valence band maximum (VBM) is mainly contributed by Pb 6p and Br 4p orbitals, while the conduction band minimum (CBM) is controlled by Pb 6s and Br 4s orbitals, which contains a certain non-localized profile, but still can be blocked by C4H14N22+ organic cations to some extent. The contribution of C4H14N22+ to VB and CB could almost be ignored, resulting in inaccurate calculation results, because it can induce strong electron–phonon coupling between PbBr42− clusters by introducing soft lattice and increasing the lattice span between MX42− clusters.30 In brief, the organic amine groups in the lattice has minor contribution to the band structure in Fig. 5; the PL and absorption process in the separated or individual PbBr42− cluster in the formed lattice can still give luminescence at 401 nm from the above-calculated band structure, as shown in Fig. 4b only at low excitation power. However, the dominant emission at weak laser pulse gives stronger emission in the longer wavelength range, which cannot be reflected in the band structure.

To gain more insight into the emission mechanism of C4H14N2PbBr4, the temperature-dependent PL of Sample 3 was measured in 80–300 K excited by 365 nm laser, and the results are completely different from that reported by Yuan et al.,18 which may be due to the fact that we used laser as an excitation source during the variable-temperature PL test. It can be seen from Fig. 6a that only one emission band can be observed at any temperature, which illustrates that the emission of C4H14N2PbBr4 only involves single emission mechanism and has a stable phase structure under the excitation of 365 nm laser. Moreover, the temperature plays a significant role in the intensity of PL, showing a remarkable increase from 300 to 80 K. Similar to the previously reported 3D perovskites (such as CsPbBr336 and CH3NH3PbBr337), which is due to the inhibition of its non-radiative recombination at low temperatures and thus has the even stronger PL intensity. Fig. 6b gives the temperature-dependent PL peak position and FWHM. It can be clearly seen that the emission peak position is insensitive to temperature and remains at 546 nm in the temperature range of 80–300 K, but its bandwidth becomes larger as the temperature rises. The band-to-band recombination emissions in semiconductors (such as ZnSe38 and CdS39) redshift with the increase in temperature due to the band gap shrinkage out of the enhanced electron–phonon couplings. However, the direct band–band transition of lead halide perovskites has the opposite situation. Lately, there are many reports about the consecutive anomalous blue shift of the emission peak in the APbX3 perovskite as the temperature increases.36,40 The introduction of the amine group or metal ion A leads to lattice expansion, resulting in a spatial confinement on the PbX6 cluster, which can balance or counteract the electron–phonon coupling, as shown in Fig. 6b. Consequently, the un-shifted emission peak for C4H14N2PbBr4 at different temperatures means that the lattice deformation energy is balanced by other Coulomb potential. With the decrease in temperature, the FWHM goes narrow obviously, which usually represents decreasing electronic coupling with acoustic phonons. The exciton and light propagation within the microstructures with an anisotropic profile are also related to this shift phenomenon.41 Moreover, we also conducted a temperature-dependent PL test on Sample 1, and the results are similar to that of Sample 3 (Fig. S11, ESI†), which further illustrates that we performed a temperature-dependent PL test on Sample 3 to investigate the luminescence mechanism of the C4H14N2PbBr4 crystal, which is reliable.

In contrast to the PL peak position, the PL integrated intensity of C4H14N2PbBr4 shows a temperature-sensitive evolution, i.e., it mildly changes from 80 K to 120 K and then constantly declines as the temperature is further elevated (Fig. 6c). The exciton binding energy (Eb), which is critical for the excitation and recombination processes of semiconductor materials, can be determined according to the following equation: (1)where I0 and I(T) in the formula are the PL integrated intensity at temperatures 0 K and T K, respectively. The Eb value of C4H14N2PbBr4 to be 1020 meV can be acquired by fitting the PL integrated intensity as a function of 1/T, which is far greater than the room-temperature thermal energy (26 meV), indicating that stable STEs could be produced to prevent the thermal quenching. It should be noted that such a large Eb value indicates that the electron–hole pair in C4H14N2PbBr4 is a typical Frenkel exciton, and further illustrates its typical nature in exciton-related emitters in OIHMHs.42
Classically, strong electron–phonon interaction is essential for the STE formation in different substances, which can be quantitatively assessed by the Huang–Rhys factor S by the following equation: (2)where T is the temperature (K) and ωphonon is the longitudinal optical phonon frequency, respectively. By fitting the FWHM (meV) as a function of temperature, we acquire the S value of C4H14NPbBr4 to be 22.8, far greater than that of previously used common emitters (e.g. ZnSe (∼1),43 CdSe (∼0.31),44 CsPbBr3 (∼3.22)45), in which the linear Fröhlich electron–phonon coupling is dominant. However, this even stronger electron–phonon coupling in C4H14NPbBr4 can lead to a distorted lattice structure due to the incorporation of amine molecules into the PbBr42− lattice. That is to say, the large Huang–Rhys factor of the present system promises clear nonlinear and anharmonic electron–phonon coupling to favor the STE formation. However, the value of S is significantly smaller than the weak PL for Cs2NaInCl6 (∼80)46 and Cs3Bi2I9 (∼79.5),47 and is comparable to the strong emission of Cs2Sn0.89Te0.11Cl6 (∼16),48 which ensures that C4H14NPbBr4 has a high PLQY due to STE emission and amine as a donor for exciton trapping.
To better understand the electron–phonon interaction in C4H14N2PbBr4 crystals, we measured a Raman spectrum of Sample 3 excited by a 532 nm laser at room temperature, and the results are given in Fig. 7a. It can be clearly seen that the three intense bands at 73, 94, and 133 cm−1 correspond to the symmetry of Ag, B1g and B2g respectively, which are related to the layered structure of PbBr2.49 The power-dependent Raman spectra of Sample 3 are shown in Fig. S12a (ESI†), and we also observe the Raman bands associated with acoustic modes at 73, 94, and 133 cm−1, showing a linear dependence on the excitation power (Fig. S12b, ESI†), which indicates that they are softly coupled states in C4H14N2PbBr4. Moreover, there are some strong Raman modes existing at even lower wavenumbers (below 54 cm−1) for the PbBr2 crystal, which are not shown in our measurement because our Raman spectrometer cannot reach this low range, but they can be found in the related literature.49 These low-frequency vibrations usually show up in the layered structure by the acoustic modes, for example, the Ag mode at about 54 cm−1 along the vibration perpendicular to the PbBr42− layers. Notably, the intense modes at 73, 133, 183, 283, 333, and 383 cm−1 show up in our spectrum, which perfectly meet the different mode coupled with the Ag mode at 50 cm−1, for its polarization along the layer coupling. The dominant band at 133 cm−1 has the highest intensity, and it does not exist independently, which is generated by superposition with 73 cm−1 and 50 cm−1 (Ag) modes, and this happens due to the alteration of two modes in the high frequency range. The optical Raman modes usually show up above 100 cm−1, and their modes at 183, 283, 333 and 383 cm−1 show a clear span of 50 cm−1 between them, which indicates that the Ag mode has combined with the different optic mode in the PbBr42− layers to form overtones. The above-mentioned facts indicate that there are two range interactions in this material. The strong interaction is related to the acoustic mode coupling, and another weak one concerns the optic mode coupling with an acoustic mode. This means that there may be chemical combination between layers via C4H14N22+, which indicates that their STE formation in such system concerns different range phonons in a large coupling magnitude. The above-mentioned results match the rule that the clear STE nature in a compound shows up with strong anharmonic electron–phonon coupling with overtone or multi-phonon involvement, and the polaron effect is dominant.

In the above discussion, we found that the emission behaviors of C4H14N2PbBr4 are significantly different when using a 365 nm UV lamp and 365 nm laser as the excitation source, respectively. To better explain this phenomenon, we re-treated Sample 3 at 100 °C for 30 minutes, and found that the PL emission peaks did not change (Fig. S13, ESI†). Subsequently, we measured the Raman spectra at different excitation powers and found that they have a similar profile (Fig. S12a, ESI†). We also conducted the PXRD measurement before and after exposure to the 365 nm laser, and found that the PXRD patterns remain nearly unchanged (Fig. S14, ESI†). Moreover, Sample 3 was simultaneously excited by a UV lamp and the laser light, which exhibits three emission bands (Fig. S15a, ESI†), corresponding to the PL emission band excited by the UV lamp (band 1 and 2) and laser (band 3), respectively. Then, Sample 3 was also excited by a 800 nm continuous-wave (CW) laser beam, and the results indicated that no signal was detected (Fig. S15b, ESI†). The above-mentioned results exclude the moisture, temperature, structure phase transition or decomposition, and the two-photon fluorescence cause their different emission bands. And thus, we believe that the bistable emission of C4H14N2PbBr4 originates from the self-trapped state with bi-minima configuration, and its photophysical processes can be described using a multi-state (bipolaron) configuration coordinate diagram (Fig. 7b). Upon photo-excitation by a UV lamp, the photoexcited electron simultaneously moves from the ground state to the excited state, an STE ultrafast population arises from the relaxation of the photoinduced carriers via exciton–phonon interaction including the minor barrier tunneling process to form STE1 (excited polaronic state), and then it may emit light after STE1 radiation recombination at 461 nm.
It is well known that laser has a much higher power, so it will produce much higher concentrations of polaronic states under laser excitation. For the laser pump case, the low energy state would be saturated soon after excitation, and then the excess excited electrons can go up to a higher vibronic state filling or transported to neighbor sites, because the neighboring PbBrx clusters are connected by one same amine molecule, and some of the neighbored electrons may be trapped by the multiphonons to cause an attraction potential via intermediate biamine for neighboring charges to form bipolaron, just as they tunnel into another deep STE2. The Deep STE2 is a STE1 molecule formed by two coupled STE1 charges, which is bound by one molecule with two amine groups. Generally, the additional charge on the chain-like polymer is not simply filled by two free electrons (or holes) in the rigid conduction band or valence band due to their Coulomb repulsion, but the neighbored electrons (or holes) could be coupled when they interact with the vibration in the polymer chain through deforming the chain around itself. The single localized charged particle together with the simultaneous lattice deformation or vibration is a polaron, and the lattice distortion caused by the charge is also called self-trapping.50 If the self-trapping energy is large enough, two polarons could form a bipolaron like that H2 molecule form. The bipolaron and the polaron have similar characteristics of carriers, but the bipolaron is double charged. Instead of a single electron that twists the chain, there are two electrons (or holes) that are bound together in the same chain deformation. Though these electrons (or holes) repel each another via Coulomb interactions, they still bound together by common chain deformation. The increased binding energy for the formation of two different chain deformations rather than a single one is much larger than the Coulomb potential for two carriers self-trapped with their separation.50 STE is a polaronic exciton state in a soft lattice with strong electron–phonon coupling in a solid.51 The deep STE or STE2 should be the bipolaronic exciton state in such an ionic structure when polaronic state are chemically coupled by a common soft molecule, especially in a 1D chain structure.52–54
In our system, the excited states are inclined to undergo an intersystem crossing from the initial singlet state to the lower lattice trapped state (polaronic), which ultimately results in a broadband emission with a large Stokes shift. However, the organic molecule (C4H12N2, CH3–NH–CH2–CH2–NH–CH3) used here has two amine groups. Therefore, when a single amine group with a positive charge interacts with a PbBr42− cluster, it forms a self-trapped state 1 (STE1), and similar experimental results also appear in the case of EAPbBr3.55 The organic molecule can combine two adjacent PbBr42− clusters to form a new 1D cluster chain, while the neighbored two STEs (polaron) can interact to form a new paired self-trapped state (STE2 = bipolaron), as shown in Fig. 7c and d, which is especially common in a 1D molecular structure.56,57
The STE (polaron) formation comes from the anharmonic lattice vibration out of electron–phonon coupling. This can be demonstrated from the Raman spectrum because the anharmonic lattice vibration of the Raman modes could be reflected by their multi-phonon mode. In this case, they are the modes that are along the direction of long-chain polarization formed by PbBr42− clusters; the 50 cm−1 Ag mode in PbBr42− cluster can involve in many other modes to form overtones,49 these overtone vibration peaks are strongly involved in the strong electron–phonon coupling. Therefore, when Sample 3 is excited by a 365 nm light beam from a UV lamp, the electrons can go up to the lower vibronic levels as shown in Fig. 7b, then tunnel to STE1, resulting in the bluish white-light emission with two bands: a high energy narrow band (Em1, 401 nm) by free excitons and a low energy broad band (Em2, 461 nm) by STE1. While excited by a 365 nm laser beam, the excited electrons can go up to higher vibronic levels, which can tunnel into bipolaronic state (STE2) and give its emission at 546 nm (Em3). STE is a dynamic excited state due to electron–phonon coupling, and it usually comes from the local Coulomb interaction between the amine group and PbBr42− cluster, that is why it has broadband emission. When its concentration increases, its lifetime may reduce due to the carrier scattering. Its excitation often depends on the excitation power and the vibronic levels excited. For low power excitation, we can see the free exciton population and emission because there is some free exciton left in original parabolic potential well, some tunnel into the STE1. But for high power excitation, the light can go long range for exciton migration, so the excited state can reach high vibronic levels for large-area light propagation and excitation, and produce separated carriers in the different locations, which easily transform into STE2 in the same molecular chain. Overall, the formation of STE and STE pairs (bipolaron) are the main cause for the bistable emission bands in this material at room temperature.
In addition to its remarkable optical properties, the air stability of C4H14N2PbBr4 is worth mentioning, and good stability is also key information for its industrial application. We stored Sample 3 in a dark environment for one month, and then investigate the stability against moisture by the PL test. As shown in Fig. S16 (ESI†), the PL emission intensity only decays about 5.6%. Moreover, when Sample 3 was subjected to heating and cooling treatment multiple times within the temperature range of 300–380 K (Fig. S17, ESI†), it still possesses a commendable emission intensity, illustrating that C4H14N2PbBr4 crystals have good thermal stability, and its initial weight loss temperature (T−5%) can reach 302 °C (Fig. S18, ESI†). Also worth noting is that Sample 3 has a good reproducibility (Fig. S19, ESI†). The emission spectra of Sample 3 prepared in five different batches have a similar profile, and the PL intensity is basically unchanged. Finally, we fabricated a bluish white-emitting LED by mixing Sample 3 with silica gel and exciting it with a 365 nm commercially available UV chip; a bright bluish white-light emission can be clearly seen from Fig. S20a (ESI†). Furthermore, Sample 3 was continuously irradiated for about 400 minutes under a 365 nm UV chip (10 mW cm−2), and its emission intensity remained at 91.3% (Fig. S20b, ESI†), which verified its high photostability. The high chemical, thermal and photostability, and large-scale manufacture along with remarkable photophysical properties make C4H14N2PbBr4 a promising light emitter for optoelectronic applications, for instance, a down conversion phosphor for UV-pumped bluish white LEDs.
4. Conclusions
In summary, we have synthesized 1D OIHMH C4H14N2PbBr4 crystals with bluish white-light emission originating from self-trapped excitons by three different methods. The third method, that is, the preparation of C4H14N2PbBr4 crystals based on modified-mechanochemical synthesis, has the characteristics of simplicity, high yield, better reproducibility, low cost, etc. At the same time, it still has a smaller particle size and high PLQY (18.4%). Interestingly, the formation of STE pairs (bipolaronic excited state) due to the coupling PbBr42− clusters by di-amine groups makes C4H14N2PbBr4 exhibit an unusual bistable emission, i.e., when excited by a 365 nm UV lamp, its emission band is dominantly located at 461 nm, while excited by a 365 nm laser, its emission band is located at 546 nm. The latter emission band comes from the bipolaronic state due to the pair STE formation. Our results are helpful to further understand the photophysical properties of low-dimensional OIHMHs, and lay a foundation for the more applications of OIHMHs.
