The evolution process is systematically investigated by variation of the annealing temperature (Ta) from 250 to 550 °C. Self-assembled Au clusters begin to nucleate at 300 °C, and wiggly nanostructures with connected geometry are formed as a transitional stage at 350 °C. Between 400 and 550 °C, self-assembled Au droplets are successfully fabricated, and they show increased average dimensions and decreased density with increasing Ta, while showing improved size uniformity above 500 °C. Throughout the Ta range, the properties of the resulting Au droplets depend on the substrates utilized, and this is systematically analyzed in relation to the root mean squared (RMS) roughness.
I. Introduction
Owing to their unique physical properties, such as 1-D quantum confinement, as well as increased surface area and cross-section, semiconductor nanowires (NWs) have been widely utilized in numerous electronic and optoelectronic devices.1–6 In energy harvesting, a single junction GaAs NW solar cell demonstrated a light conversion efficiency over 40% above the Shockley–Queisser limit due to its increased absorption cross-section.6,7 Since the first demonstration by R. S. Wagner et al. during their study on single crystal growth from the vapor on Si in the 1960s,8,9 the vapor–liquid–solid (VLS) growth mechanism utilizing liquid metallic droplets as catalysts has been widely employed to grow diverse NWs such as Si, Ge, GaAs, InAs, CdSe and ZnO NWs.10–19 For their excellent capacity of transferring the vapor phase precursors into single crystals at the solid–liquid interface due to the higher sticking coefficient induced by super-saturation, liquid phase Au droplets are commonly adopted in various material systems.20–22 In the meantime, surface index plays a key role in the fabrication of VLS-based NWs. For example, by suppressing the super-saturation of the liquid Au droplets by utilizing high density short terraces or large size gold droplets, zinc blende GaAs NWs without stacking faults were successfully synthesized on GaAs (311)B,23 and higher density GaAs NWs have been synthesized on GaAs (211)B by controlling the density of the self-assembled Au droplets.24 In addition, Au nanoparticles on various substrates such as Si, SiO2, sapphire, GaN, etc. have drawn a lot of research interest due to their unique properties and applications, such as localized surface plasmon resonance, bio-sensing, catalysis, quantum size effect, biology, etc.25–32 Naturally, the study of the behaviors of Au droplets on high index GaAs surfaces became an essential research topic. Nevertheless, to date, systematic studies on the control of Au droplets on high index GaAs are still lacking and therefore, in this paper, we demonstrate the effect of annealing temperature (Ta) on the fabrication of self-assembled Au droplets on diverse type-B GaAs (n11) surfaces, where n is 9, 7, 5, 4, and 2. Through varying the annealing temperature from 250 to 550 °C on various type-B GaAs (n11) surfaces, the investigation was systematically performed and consequently, as evidenced by the atomic force microscopy images, the increased thermal energy promoted the nucleation of Au clusters and wiggly Au nanostructures, as well as self-assembled Au droplets with excellent uniformities. As an example, the fabrication process of the self-assembled Au droplets on GaAs (211)B is briefly illustrated in Fig. 1. In Fig. 1(a), GaAs (211)B is shown after Au deposition and before annealing, and the surface appears to be quite flat, as clearly seen in the line-profile of Fig. 1(a-1). After annealing at 350 °C, wiggly Au nano-clusters were formed with a height modulation of ~±10 nm, as shown in Fig. 1(b). When the annealing temperature was increased to 450 °C, the nano-clusters developed into self-assembled round-shaped Au droplets, as shown in Fig. 1(c). Between 400 and 550 °C, the Au droplets show increasing dimensions, including average height and lateral diameter, as well as gradually decreasing density, as a function of the annealing temperature. Notably, differences in the size and density of the Au droplets on the various indices clearly existed and persistently appeared throughout the temperature range.

II. Experimental details
In this work, the effect of annealing temperature on the fabrication of self-assembled Au droplets on various type-B GaAs (n11) surfaces, where n is 9, 7, 5, 4, and 2, was investigated. The GaAs wafers utilized were semi-insulating, with an off-axis of ±0.1°, and were obtained from Wafer Technology Ltd. A pulsed laser deposition (PLD) system was employed to synthesize the self-assembled Au droplets on the corresponding samples. Initially, a batch of samples was indium soldered side-by-side on an Inconel holder and degassed at 350 °C for 30 min under a chamber vacuum below 1 × 10−4 Torr to remove contaminants. For a systematic study on the effect of annealing temperature, the thickness of Au was fixed at 2.5 nm, with a growth rate of 0.05 nm s−1 and an ionization current of 3 mA at 1 × 10−1 Torr in a plasma ion-coater. As the emphasis of this study, the annealing process was systematically performed at substrate temperatures (Tsub) of 250, 300, 350, 400, 450, 500, and 550 °C, and the fabrication processes were computer-controlled in accordance with pre-programmed recipes. With the chamber pressure below 1 × 10−4 Torr, the Tsub was gradually raised to each target at a rate of 1.83 °C s−1 and kept at each target temperature for 450 s to ensure the maturation of Au droplets for each growth. Immediately after the termination of growth, the Tsub was quenched down to ambient temperature to reduce Ostwald ripening.33–35 An atomic force microscope (AFM) was employed in air in the non contact (tapping) mode for characterization of the samples. The utilized AFM tip (NSC16/AIBS, μmasch) was coated with Al on the backside, the radius of curvature was less than 10 nm, and the tip height was between 20 and 25 μm, with a full cone angle of less than 30°. The tip resonated at a frequency of ~170 kHz, and the spring constant was ~40 N m−1. After the acquisition of images, a simple flattening process for the whole image along both the x and y directions was adopted in order to improve the image quality. As is well known, the lateral size measurement can be strongly affected by the tip convolution when the aspect ratio of the target object is high with high density, and thus tips of the same type and from a single batch were utilized to minimize the effect of the tip on the lateral size. The AFM analysis software XEI was used for analyzing the obtained data, including the line-profiles, Fourier Filter Transform (FFT) power spectra and height distribution histograms (HDHs).
III. Results and discussion

Fig. 2 shows the nucleation of the self-assembled Au clusters, as well as the wiggly nanostructures, on GaAs (211)B at annealing temperatures (Ta) between 250 and 350 °C, with 2.5 nm Au deposition and annealing duration of 450 s. AFM top-views of the corresponding samples are shown in Fig. 2(a)–(e), and the white lines indicate the positions of the line-profiles shown in Fig. 2(a-1)–(e-1). The Fourier Filter Transform (FFT) power spectra of the corresponding samples are presented in Fig. 2(a-2)–(e-2), and Fig. 2(a-3)–(e-3) show the height distribution histograms (HDHs) of each sample. In general, on gradually increasing Ta from 250 °C to 350 °C, nucleation of Au clusters on GaAs (211)B was observed, and then the Au clusters evolved stepwise into larger nano-mounds. For example, the bare GaAs (211)B in Fig. 2(a), the pre-annealed surface after Au deposition in Fig. 2(b) and the sample annealed at 250 °C in Fig. 2(c) showed minor differences, as clearly evidenced by the AFM images, as well as the line-profiles in Fig. 2(a-1)–(c-1). The HDH at 250 °C showed a distribution of ~±1.5 nm as seen in Fig. 2(c-3). At 300 °C, nucleation of the Au clusters was clearly observed, and the height distribution was slightly increased to ~±2 nm. Then, at 350 °C, a significant surface morphology change was observed, with the formation of irregular wiggly Au mounds, and the height distribution of the nanostructures sharply increased to ~±12 nm, as shown in Fig. 2(e) and (e-3). The formation of wiggly Au mounds can be described based on the coalescence model,36–39 in which lower coverage can lead to partial coalescence. In the FFT power spectra in Fig. 2(a-2)–(c-2), directed gullies in the AFM images are reflected in the FFT lines along the perpendicular directions. However, for the nucleated clusters and wiggly nanostructures at 300 and 350 °C shown in Fig. 2(d) and (e), the FFT patterns were symmetrically round with no obvious directionality, as shown in Fig. 2(d-2) and (e-2).

Fig. 3 presents the evolution of the self-assembled Au droplets on GaAs (211)B at temperatures between 400 and 550 °C. The corresponding large-scale AFM top-views and the inserted small-scale images are shown in Fig. 3(a)–(d). The line-profiles, the FFT power spectra and the HDHs are shown in Fig. 3(a-1)–(d-1), Fig. 3(a-2)–(d-2) and Fig. 3(a-3)–(d-3), respectively. Fig. 4(a) and (b) show the EDS spectra of the samples annealed at 250 °C and 550 °C, respectively. The average droplet height (AH), lateral diameter (LD) and average density (AD) are summarized in Fig. 5(a)–(c), and the specific values of the AH, LD and AD are listed in Table 1. In general, between 400 and 550 °C, evolution of the Au droplets continued, and self-assembled Au droplets were successfully fabricated. The size of the Au droplets, including the AH and LD, gradually increased as a function of the Ta, while the AD gradually decreased. For instance, at 400 °C, as shown in Fig. 3(a), the Au mounds were more separated compared to those annealed at 350 °C, and Au nano-islands with somewhat poor uniformity were formed: AH: 16.59 nm, LD: 95.8 nm and AD: 2.12 × 1010 cm−2. When the Ta was increased to 450 °C, smaller Au droplets with quite excellent uniformity resulted, and the AH of the Au droplets increased by ×1.19 to 19.66 nm and the LD was increased by ×1.09 to 104 nm, as shown in Fig. 3(b) and 5. At the same time, the AD decreased by ×1.06 to 2.00 × 1010 cm−2. Then at 500 °C, the Au droplet size kept increasing, as clearly shown in Fig. 3(c), and the AH increased by ×1.13 to 22.24 nm and the LD increased by ×1.16 to 120.6 nm. Meanwhile the corresponding AD was reduced by ×1.16 to 1.73 × 1010 cm−2. Finally, when the Ta was 550 °C, the AH and LD increased by ×1.07 and ×1.02 to 23.71 and 123.4 nm, respectively, and the AD was reduced by ×1.04 to 1.66 × 1010 cm−2. Overall, the Au droplets on GaAs (211)B showed a gradual size increase with an associated density decrease as the Ta was increased from 400 to 550 °C: the AH increased by ×1.43 from 16.59 to 23.71 nm, the LD increased by ×1.29 from 95.8 to 123.4 nm and the AD was reduced by ×1.28 from 2.12 × 1010 to 1.66 × 1010 cm−2. The size increase with increasing Ta can also be clearly seen in the line-profiles in Fig. 3(a-1)–(d-1) and in the HDHs in Fig. 3(a-3)–(d-3). The FFT power spectra in Fig. 3(a-2)–(d-2) showed round patterns, as no preferential directional tropism along any crystal direction was observed for the Au droplets on GaAs (211)B. The EDS spectra of the samples annealed on GaAs (211)B at 250 and 550 °C showed similar graphs, while the surface morphologies of the two samples were quite dissimilar, as shown in Fig. 4(a-1) and (b-1). For example, both the Lα1 peaks of Ga and As at 1.096 and 1.282 keV, respectively, and the Kα1 peaks of Ga and As at 9.243 and 10.532 keV, respectively, were clearly observed, as shown in Fig. 4(a) and (b), while the Au Mα1 peak at 2.123 keV and the Au Lα1 peak at 9.711 keV were observed with similar peak counts. Due to the large interaction volume of the X-rays with the substrates and the small volume of the Au, the EDS spectra were comparable even though the surface morphologies were quite different. The fabrication of the self-assembled Au droplets can be explained based on the Volmer–Weber (V–W) growth mode.40–43 According to the V–W growth mode, the binding energy between the adatoms is greater than that between the adatoms and the surface atoms. Thus, given sufficient diffusion energy, the adatoms tend to hold together and thus form 3-D islands rather than 2-D layers. The observed evolution trend, namely the increased size along with the decreased density, can be explained by the thermodynamics of Au adatom diffusion, which is directly related to the annealing temperature (Ta). The diffusion length (ld) of the adatoms largely depends on the surface diffusion coefficient (D) in an ideal situation based on a simple thermodynamic equilibrium model, and the D shows a strong dependence on the Ta. Thus, theoretically, we can expect an enhanced ld for adatoms at an elevated Ta and vice versa.40–43 With the enhanced Ta, the diffusion length (ld) of the Au adatoms can be enhanced, and given that the binding energy between the adatoms is greater, the probability of adatom incorporation into the droplets can be further increased along with longer ld. Droplets tend to absorb neighboring adatoms, as larger dimensions are preferred to reduce the surface energy. As a result, the droplet size can grow larger, along with decreased density, as a function of Ta. A similar evolutionary trend was also observed for In droplets and nanorings.44,45

Fig. 6 shows the evolution of self-assembled Au droplets on GaAs (411)B on gradually increasing the temperature from 250 to 550 °C. The resulting data are presented as AFM images in Fig. 6(a)–(g), line-profiles in Fig. 6(a-1)–(g-1), FFT power spectra in Fig. 6(a-2)–(g-2) and HDHs in Fig. 6(a-3)–(g-3). Overall, quite a similar evolutionary trend was observed on GaAs (411)B, including the nucleation of Au clusters and nano-mounds and the increase in size with the corresponding decrease in density as a function of Ta. As summarized in Fig. 5 and Table 1, the self-assembled Au droplets fabricated on GaAs (411)B showed bigger sizes, including both AH and LD, as well as lower density, compared with those fabricated on (211)B, for each corresponding temperature point. For example, at 400 °C, the Au droplets on (411)B had an AH of 18.48 nm and an LD of 97.8 nm. Compared with (211)B, the AH and LD increased by ×1.13 and ×1.02, respectively. Meanwhile, the corresponding AD for (411)B was 1.77 × 1010 cm−2 and decreased by ×1.2 as compared to that for (211)B. At 550 °C, the AH and LD increased by ×1.17 and ×1.03 respectively to 27.72 and 127 nm, as compared with the results for (211)B and the AD decreased by ×1.21 to 1.37 × 1010 cm−2. The fabrication of the self-assembled Au droplets on GaAs (511)B is presented in Fig. 7, with the AFM top-views in Fig. 7(a)–(d), the line-profiles in Fig. 7(a-1)–(d-1), the FFT power spectra in Fig. 7(a-2)–(d-2) and the HDHs in Fig. 7(a-3)–(d-3). The self-assembled Au droplets fabricated on GaAs (511)B also showed increased size and decreased density when the Ta was increased from 400 to 550 °C. More specifically, the AH of the Au droplets on GaAs (511)B increased from 21.93 to 31.41 nm, the LD increased from 114.8 to 139.5 nm, and the corresponding AD was reduced from 1.37 × 1010 cm−2 to 1.1 × 1010 cm−2 between 400 and 550 °C. This tendency was also clearly evidenced by the line-profiles and HDHs, as shown in Fig. 7(a-1)–(d-1) and Fig. 7(a-3)–(d-3). As shown in Fig. 5, the Au droplets on GaAs (511)B showed larger AH and LD and a correspondingly lower density than the droplets on (211)B, as well as those on (411)B.

Relevant 3 × 3 μm2 AFM top-views are shown in (a)–(g), and the insets are 1 × 1 μm2 detailed images. The white lines in the top-views indicate the positions of the line-profiles shown in (a-1)–(g-1). FFT power spectra are shown in (a-2)–(g-2) and the related HDHs are shown in (a-3)–(g-3).

Finally, in Fig. 8, the AFM top-views, the line-profiles and the FFT power spectra for the resulting Au droplets on GaAs (711)B and (911)B are presented. As seen in Fig. 5, the self-assembled Au droplets on (711)B possessed larger dimensions and a correspondingly lower density than those on (911)B. Meanwhile, the sizes of the Au droplets on both (711)B and (911)B were smaller than the size of those on (511)B, and thus the droplet density on (511)B was lower compared with (711)B and (911)B. While type-A surfaces are created by mis-orientation toward [011] from the singular (100) without any mis-cut in the zinc blende lattice, type-B surfaces can be made by a mis-cut toward [01−1].46 The type-A GaAs surface is characterized to be Ga rich, while the type-B surface is As rich, and the Ga rich surface possesses a higher interface energy than the As rich surface based on atomistic modeling of the Au droplet–GaAs interface.47 The off-orientation angles of the surfaces gradually increase with decreasing index: 8.9° for (911)B, 11.4° for (711)B, 15.8° for (511)B, 19.5° for (411)B, and 35.3° for (211)B, and the step density (DS) shows the opposite trend. In terms of the droplet size and density for these high index GaAs type-B samples, the largest droplets were fabricated on (511)B, followed by (711)B, (411)B, (911)B and (211)B, while the density showed the opposite trend, as shown in Fig. 5. We note that the index-dependent size and density can be related to different degrees of surface diffusion affected by the root mean squared (RMS) surface roughness.48–51 To quantify, the RMS surface roughness (Rq) of the various indices was measured using the software-assisted calculations of the data obtained from the AFM images of the bare substrates, and the Rq values were as follows: (511)B: 0.18 nm; (711)B: 0.20 nm; (411)B: 0.23 nm; (911)B: 0.25 nm; and (211)B: 0.30 nm. The Rq values measured were consistent with the results presented here. The Rq can be affected by various factors, such as surface reconstruction, dangling bonds, step density, etc. If one surface possesses a higher Rq, this can lead to a smaller lD and thus would result in smaller size droplets. Meanwhile, we can expect a higher density of Au droplets on a surface with higher Rq, due to the decreased lD, and vice versa.

IV. Conclusions
In conclusion, we characterized the evolution of self-assembled Au droplets on various GaAs type-B (n11) substrates, where n is 9, 7, 5, 4, and 2, induced by varying the annealing temperature (Ta). The nucleation and evolution of Au clusters, wiggly nanostructures and droplets were investigated by systematically varying the Ta from 250 °C to 550 °C. The nucleation of Au clusters was observed at 300 °C, and Au nanostructures with wiggly shapes were synthesized at 350 °C. Fully developed round Au droplets were formed on raising the Ta to 400–550 °C. The droplet size, including height and diameter, gradually increased and, conversely, the density steadily decreased as function of Ta, based on the Volmer–Weber (V–W) growth mode and the thermodynamics of Au adatom diffusion. Differences in the size of the Au droplets on the various indices clearly existed and persistently appeared throughout the temperature range: (511)B > (711)B > (411)B > (911)B > (211)B, while the density showed the opposite trend. The root mean squared (RMS) surface roughness measurements were consistent with the results and were discussed in terms of surface diffusion. The results were systematically analyzed and discussed using AFM and SEM images, EDS, cross-sectional line-profiles, dimension and density plots, RMS roughness and FFT power spectra.
