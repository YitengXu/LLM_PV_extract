    , Accepted 14th March 2017First published on 21st March 2017AbstractReduced graphene oxide (rGO) has recently emerged as a very promising family of exotic carbon material with augmented performance in electronic and optoelectronic devices. Herein, we report an efficient and novel inorganic electroluminescent device geometry, where a new phosphor composite, reduced graphene oxide wrapped ZnS:Cu,Al, acts as an active emitting layer and an exfoliated hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) as a dielectric layer. The roles of rGO in the active layer as a conductive support and local electric field enhancing agent are attributed to its wrinkles being unraveled compared with other carbon exotic nano-forms such as carbon nanotubes, graphite, charcoal and activated carbon, which significantly improves the brightness of the device (∼50 cd m−2 for 0.50 wt% rGO/ZnS:Cu,Al at 10 kHz and 110 V with an external quantum efficiency of ∼6.3% ± 0.1% and current efficiency of ∼0.81 ± 0.09 cd A−1). This new and facile strategy to construct the luminescent devices could be a paradigm shift towards cost effective, highly stable in air (for several days) and energy efficient next generation display devices.
1. Introduction
Inorganic electroluminescence (EL) is a phenomenon of visible light emission in the presence of a strong electric field. Inorganic material-assisted EL has potential uses in large area illumination and flat-panel display applications because of its stability in air, low cost, mass production capabilities and efficient energy conversion.1,2 However, the relatively low stability in air and high driving voltages of EL devices are obstacles to their large scale use, such as backlights in commercialized low cost liquid crystal displays.3 Various approaches have been attempted over the last decade with limited success in enhancing the EL performance of the devices in terms of low turn-on voltage and high brightness.4 Although LEDs made from quantum dots5,6 or perovskite NPs7 have good luminance efficiency and better external quantum efficiency at a low operating voltage, all these devices suffer from a low stability in air, which is an essential parameter for practical applications.5–7
Reduced graphene oxide (rGO), a one atom-thick two-dimensional (2D) layer with reasonable visible light transmittance, excellent electrical and thermal conductivity and considerable mechanical strength, has inspired the development of graphene-based optoelectronics, such as liquid-crystal display devices (LCDs), light emitting diodes (LEDs), touch-screen panels, and solar cells due to their high yield production abilities via chemical routes.8–11 The high surface area and flexibility of 2D graphene or its functional derivatives enable a good interfacial contact with particles, allowing it to attach well with the dispersed particles to form an extremely conductive matrix while preventing particle agglomeration during volume expansion/contraction.12,13 rGO also has the capability to increase the number of carrier injection sites, when it is incorporated with nano/bulk phosphors in inorganic electroluminescence devices.14 Furthermore, mechanical instabilities such as wrinkles, folds and twists on the 2D surfaces during the synthesis can cause an augmented surface contact area between rGO and the emitting material, which leads to an enhancement in the performance of the EL device, which is further probed in this study.
Herein, we made an effort towards reducing the operating voltage of EL devices with the incorporation of exotic forms of carbon, such as carbon nanotubes {single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) and multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs)}, activated carbon, charcoal and rGO, in the emitting layer of the device to enhance the electric field. Such a comparative study of EL devices based on exotic forms of carbon has not been reported till date. The EL device structure is made of a top electrode of gold layer, a dielectric layer, luminescent layer (phosphor + rGO) and a glass ITO electrode for light emission.
Integration of the dielectric layer in an EL device is essential to prevent the catastrophic dielectric breakdown of the device.15 The performance of an EL device can be improved by introducing a high dielectric constant layer, which can further help to increase the charge density in phosphor.16,17 Zinc sulfide doped with copper,aluminium (ZnS:Cu,Al) was synthesized via a modified wet chemical method and its composites using different exotic forms of carbon were studied as an emitting layer in EL devices.
2. Experimental
2.1 Synthesis of the ZnS:Cu,Al phosphor and rGO
In order to fabricate the EL device, we first synthesized the emission layer material in successive steps. The ZnS:Cu,Al phosphor was synthesized via a wet chemical method. A flow chart for the synthesis of the ZnS:Cu,Al phosphor is given in the ESI (Scheme S1†). The rGO nanosheets were synthesized via the chemical exfoliation of graphite flakes using the improved Humber's method.18 The obtained graphene oxide (GO) powder was reduced upon treatment with hydrazine monohydrate at elevated temperatures (100 °C in a vacuum oven) to obtain reduced graphene oxide (rGO). This rGO has significantly improved electrical conductivity because of the removal of the oxygen functionalities from GO; rGO has several defects and residual functional groups.
2.2 Fabrication of the EL device

Scheme 1 shows a schematic of the fabrication of the EL devices. To fabricate the EL device, an ITO glass substrate was used as an electrode. Two protecting blue strip tapes were pasted onto the ITO glass to obtain the electrode pattern. Zinc dust with a small amount of water was mixed and deposited as a layer on the ITO glass as well as on the tape, and then the substrate was dissolved in HCl. After this process, ITO was only below the tape strips, which had protected it from the etching process. Removal of the tape strips would result in the exposure of an alternative layer of glass and ITO. The obtained sample is shown in the scheme by P and Q, which represent the ITO electrodes. Another tape was glued perpendicular to the ITO strip (as shown in the scheme). The green light emitting layer was made of ZnS:Cu,Al phosphor and rGO. Both the as-synthesized green phosphor and the rGO paste were prepared separately, and then ethyl cellulose and butyl carbitol solutions were used as the binder and solvent, respectively, which were earlier used by another group for study on the CNT/ZnS:Cu,Al hybrid material.3 Furthermore, to prepare the hybrid structure of the phosphor and rGO with a known proportion of rGO, two pastes of rGO and the phosphor were mixed together in a particular ratio, mechanically stirred for 6 h and then softened for 10 min as per an earlier established method used for the fabrication of a layer of the CNT/ZnS:Cu,Al EL device.3 The hybrid paste solution was deposited via a spray coating method on the obtained ITO glass (bottom electrode) substrate.19 The spray coating method and optimization of the nozzle size were earlier used by our group for the fabrication of a paintable battery.19 To confirm the coating, the sample was excited under a UV lamp at a wavelength of 365 nm showing a strong green emission, which is indicated by an arrow in Scheme 1. A hexagonal exfoliated boron nitride (h-BN) layer was used as the dielectric layer. The dielectric properties of this layer can increase the charge density in the phosphor due to the large specific surface area of the exfoliated h-BN nanosheets, where the increased specific surface area arises from the high packing density of the exfoliated two dimensional h-BN layer. Moreover, h-BN as a dielectric layer in EL device provides more stability against catastrophic dielectric breakdown at higher applied voltages compared to the commonly used SiO2 and BaTiO3. The other advantage of using h-BN layer in place of SiO2 is that the former is thermally more stable compared to latter. The synthesis process for the exfoliated h-BN layer is described in detail in Scheme S2 (see the ESI†), which is well studied in our earlier study.20 The exfoliated h-BN layer was mixed well with ethyl cellulose3 (binder) and butyl carbitol3 (solvent) solution and deposited on ZnS:Cu,Al + rGO (green emitting layer) in the EL device. The ethyl cellulose with butyl carbitol precursor provides additional protection against air born contaminations in the EL device. The h-BN film was deposited via a spray coating technique.19 To confirm the uniform coating, the sample was excited under UV lamp at a wavelength of 254 nm as shown by an arrow in Scheme 1. The device was baked at 130 °C for 30 min. The top gold electrode (200 ± 2 nm thickness) was deposited on these layers via a radio frequency (RF)-sputtering technique prior to the removal of the blue strip tape. To compare the performance of the devices, we fabricated devices with different concentrations of rGO (0.01, 0.05, 0.10, 0.50 and 0.70 wt%). The finally laminated EL device is shown by an arrow in Scheme 1.

2.3 Characterization
The structure of the as-synthesized ZnS:Cu,Al phosphor was investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) using a PANalytical X'pert PRO X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα1 radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å). Before the XRD measurement, the diffractometer was standardized using silicon powder (d111 = 3.1353 Å) to avoid any type of errors in the measurement.21 Raman spectroscopy was performed on a Renishaw 1000 spectrometer equipped with a Leica microscope DM LM with 514.5 nm wavelength laser at room temperature. Fourier transform infra-red (FTIR) spectroscopy was performed using Thermo Scientific model: NICOLET 6700 spectrometer. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed using a Perkin Elmer, PHI1257 equipped with a hemispherical electron energy analyzer with a non-monochromatic Al Kα source with an excitation energy of 1486.7 eV at room temperature. The surface morphology and microstructural characterizations were carried out via scanning electron microscopy (SEM) on model no. Zeiss EVO MA 10 and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy/electron microscopy (HRTEM/TEM) on model Technai G20-twin, operating at 200 kV. Photoluminescence (PL) characterization was performed using an Edinburgh, FL-900 spectrometer with a xenon lamp as the source of excitation. Time-resolved spectroscopic measurements were performed using an Edinburgh, FL-900 spectrometer with an excitation wavelength of 375 nm using a picosecond pulsed diode laser. We examined the emission properties of the EL devices at ambient conditions by changing the AC voltage at a fixed frequency and vice versa. The combination of a self-designed function generator (equivalent to Agilent, 33250A) and a power amplifier (Trek P0610B-K) was used to generate the sinusoidal AC high voltages, and an oscilloscope (Hewlett-Packard 4001) was used to monitor the actual value of the voltage applied to the EL device. The emission images of the EL devices were taken using a digital camera (Nikon, E8800).
3. Results and discussion
The XRD pattern of the as-synthesized green emitting ZnS:Cu,Al phosphor is shown in Fig. S1 (see the ESI†). All the peaks are indexed as the (111), (200), (220), (311), (222), (400), (331) and (420) planes of the cubic zinc-blende crystal structure having the space group F3m and lattice parameters a = b = c = 5.4387 ± 0.0668 Å of ZnS. The obtained lattice parameters are in a good agreement with JCPDS #05-0566.22 The absence of the additional diffraction peaks associated with metallic Cu and Al indicates the presence of single phase crystals. Furthermore, the XPS survey-scan of the green emitting ZnS:Cu,Al phosphor is exhibited in Fig. S2a (see the ESI†). Before the XPS measurements, the binding energies were standardized by calibrating the C 1s peak at 284.6 eV as a reference. The other significant peaks present at 77 eV, 162.5 eV, 288 eV, 934 eV and 1022.5 eV correspond to the Al 2p, S 2p, C 1s, Cu 2p and Zn 2p peaks, respectively.23 The XPS results confirm the composition of the ZnS:Cu,Al phosphor. The XPS core level spectra of Al 2p, S 2p, C 1s, Cu 2p and Zn 2p for the ZnS:Cu,Al phosphor are shown in Fig. S2b–S2f, respectively (see the ESI†). The homogeneous morphology of the as-synthesized ZnS:Cu,Al phosphor sample is evident from the scanning electron microscopic images exhibited in Fig. S3 (see ESI†).
The microstructural properties of the phosphor play a significant role in the PL characteristics because a good crystallinity of the host-activator system allows efficient energy transfer from the host to the activator, which is supplementary evidenced through their respective PL spectra. The PL characteristics of the as-synthesized ZnS:Cu,Al phosphor were probed by the PL excitation and emission spectra. The PL excitation spectrum of the green emitting ZnS:Cu,Al phosphor is shown in Fig. S4a (see the ESI†), which was traced by monitoring the emission wavelength at 520 nm. The PL emission spectrum of the green emitting ZnS:Cu,Al phosphor is shown in Fig. S4b (see the ESI†) at an excitation wavelength of 337 nm. Because of the Al doping in ZnS, a green side band at 520 nm appears due to an intra-band-gap transition, which has been observed only in Cu–Al containing ZnS.24,25 The inset of Fig. S4b† displays the optical photographic image of the ZnS:Cu,Al phosphor powder that is placed in a vial and further excited using a 365 nm movable UV lamp, in which a strong green emission appears. The optical photograph was taken using a Nikon digital camera. The CIE color co-ordinates (chromaticity diagram) obtained from the emission spectrum are x = 0.2771 and y = 0.4758, as shown in Fig. S4c (see the ESI†) and are typically located in the green region. The performance of any display device depends upon the decay lifetime of the constituting material. The decay lifetime generally corresponds to the exciton lifetime, which depends upon the structural purity of the material. A time-correlated single photon counting technique was employed to record the TRPL curve using a 375 nm pulse diode laser as the source of excitation at a fixed emission wavelength of 520 nm. The TRPL decay spectrum with the fitting curve and parameters generated for the ZnS:Cu,Al phosphor are shown in Fig. S4d (see the ESI†). For the ZnS:Cu,Al phosphor, the decay in lifetime was in the range of microseconds. The lifetime data for the ZnS:Cu,Al phosphor transitions are in accordance with the double-exponential function as described by eqn (1):2,3,21,25 I(t) = A1exp(−t/τ1) + A2exp(−t/τ2)(1)where τ1 and τ2 are the decay lifetimes of the luminescence, and A1 and A2 are the weighting parameters. The observed lifetimes for the phosphor are τ1 = 22.83 μs and τ2 = 87.63 μs. The obtained results reveal that the decay time for the phosphors with the Cu and Al co-dopant are comparatively longer. The obtained lifetime result exhibits a second order exponential decay, which is consistent with our earlier studies.2 The average lifetime (τavg) was calculated to be 58.75 μs for the double exponential decay. The obtained TRPL results suggest that the as-synthesized materials are highly suitable for display devices.
The as-synthesized rGO was also characterized structurally to confirm the formation of rGO. Raman spectroscopy is a suitable technique to assess the structure of the rGO sheets.3 The Raman spectrum of the as-synthesized rGO is shown in Fig. S5 (see the ESI†). The characteristic Raman peaks at around 1316 cm−1 and 1590 cm−1 are assigned to the disordered sp2 carbon (D-band) and well-ordered graphite (G-band), respectively.8,26,27 The intensity ratio of the D to G bands (ID/IG = 0.665) corresponds to the disorder in the graphene nanosheets, which originates due to defects associated with grain boundaries, vacancies and amorphous carbons.26,27 The FTIR spectra have been used to examine the reduction of the oxygen containing functional groups in GO after its conversion into rGO. The FTIR spectrum of the as-synthesized rGO is shown in Fig. S6 (see the ESI†). The FTIR spectrum clearly reveals that the oxygen containing functional groups were removed from all sites except the graphene basal plane, which confirms the reduction of GO into rGO.27 Furthermore, evidence for the aromatic CC stretching vibrations of the graphitic plane at ∼1600 cm−1 indicates the existence of a sp2 hybridized honeycomb lattice.26,27 The as-synthesized rGO samples were analyzed by XPS to examine the purity, chemical bonding states and chemical composition. The XPS survey scan spectrum of the as-synthesized rGO is shown in Fig. S7 (see the ESI†). All the observed peaks were associated to only oxygen and carbon elements, showing high purity of rGO.9,26,27 The morphology of the as-synthesized rGO samples were investigated using SEM, as shown in Fig. S8a (see the ESI†). The synthesized rGO nanosheets are layered and irregular structures and have wrinkles. Fig. S8b (see the ESI†) shows the TEM image of the single- or few-layered rGO nanosheets that have numerous wrinkles in their layered structure. Waviness and wrinkles indicate the intrinsic characteristics of graphene.27 The as-synthesized rGO nanosheets powder is shown in the upper inset of Fig. S8b.† The rGO nanosheets can also be confirmed by the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern, as shown in the lower inset of Fig. S8b.† Due to the stacking of a few layers of rGO the diffraction rings can be clearly assigned to the (002) and (101) planes.
The luminescence measurement setup for the analysis of brightness is given in Scheme S3 (see the ESI†). Fig. 1 depicts the EL measurements used to investigate the brightness of the device, which is a function of the applied voltage for various concentrations of rGO in the ZnS:Cu,Al phosphor composite at a frequency of 10 kHz. It can be seen that the brightness of the EL device depends on the concentration of rGO in ZnS:Cu,Al. The brightness of the EL device above 75 V is directly proportional to the applied driving voltage for 0.50 wt% rGO in the ZnS:Cu,Al phosphor composite. For optimization of the device, we fabricated several devices with different concentrations of rGO in the ZnS:Cu,Al phosphor composite from 0.1 to 0.9 wt%. The maximum brightness was obtained for the ZnS:Cu,Al phosphor with 0.50 wt% rGO and it was ∼50 cd m−2 at 110 V with an external quantum efficiency of ∼6.3 ± 0.1% with a current efficiency of ∼0.81 ± 0.09 cd A−1. Above the 0.50 wt% concentration of rGO, the brightness of the EL device decreases. This may be due to the non-uniform dispersion of rGO in the ZnS:Cu,Al/rGO composite, which may produce a blocking effect in the emitting layer. In order to examine the reproducibility of the optimized EL device, we fabricated more than twenty EL devices. The statistical output was evaluated and considered as the optimum result. We found that all the devices show highly reproducible results and there was no significant deviation in any of the device's performance.

The highest optimized EL brightness with an applied driving voltage at a fixed frequency (10 kHz) for various concentrations of rGO in the ZnS:Cu,Al phosphor composite is given in Table 1. The nanometer-sized thick exfoliated h-BN dielectric layer also plays a key role, which enhances the charge density and decreases the leakage current, resulting in an increased luminescence and efficiency compared to the EL devices fabricated using SiO2 and BaTiO3, as shown in Fig. S9 (see the ESI†). For a comparative study of EL devices, we took the same amount of materials as well as same state of art for dielectric layer deposition. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first meaningful report on the EL of a ZnS:Cu,Al phosphor composite with rGO to date. The I–V characteristics of the EL device fabricated with the ZnS:Cu,Al phosphor and 0.50 wt% rGO is shown in Fig. S9 (see the ESI†). In Fig. S9,† the inset image shows the measurement set-up. The current of the EL device linearly increases with respect to the applied voltage.

The brightness of the EL devices for the ZnS:Cu,Al phosphor composite with different exotic forms of carbon (rGO, SWCNT, MWCNT, graphite, activated carbon and charcoal) were measured as a function of the AC driving voltage at 10 kHz is shown in Fig. 2. Although the brightness can be strongly affected by the structure and materials, the brightness of the phosphor with rGO was better than those of the EL devices manufactured with other forms of carbon. The rGO layer increases the specific surface area with a strong local electric field in the emitting layer. This enhanced electric field increases electron tunneling and accelerates electron–hole recombination in the ZnS lattice, thereby increasing the luminescence intensity. Moreover, the wrapping of the rGO nanosheets on the surface of the ZnS:Cu,Al phosphor can provide a strong and close contact between the phosphor and the rGO nanosheets compared to other exotic forms of carbon with different morphologies.

Furthermore, the EL device at high frequency will increase the probability of electron–hole pair recombination.1 As an outcome of this, the brightness of the EL devices increases with an increase in the applied frequency of the source. The summarized data for the frequency with respect to the brightness at a fixed operating voltage of 110 V for the EL device fabricated with the ZnS:Cu,Al phosphor and 0.50 wt% rGO is given in Table 2.

The EL spectra of the device having different dielectric layers (exfoliated h-BN, BaTiO3 and SiO2) are shown in Fig. 3a. It can be clearly observed that an EL device with an exfoliated h-BN layer has the maximum EL intensity compared to the other dielectric materials used (BaTiO3 and SiO2) for the EL devices. The electric field applied to the phosphor can be calculated as follows:29Ep = εDV/(εDLD + εpLp)where, εD and εp are the permittivities of the dielectric and phosphor layer, respectively. LD and Lp are the thickness of the dielectric and phosphor layer, respectively. The permittivity of the exfoliated h-BN is higher than the other dielectric materials used (BaTiO3, SiO2). The EL intensity spectrum of the EL device with an exfoliated h-BN layer is shown in Fig. 3b, where h-BN has an improved EL performance. The chromaticity diagram obtained from the emission spectra with CIE color co-ordinates being x = 0.2766 and y = 0.5423 is shown in Fig. 3c, and the coordinates fall in the green region. The optical image of the EL device is depicted in Fig. 3d. The device image with green EL emission at 110 V and 10 kHz is also shown in Fig. 3e. The stability of the optimized device in air was examined in a continuous (min) and non-continuous (several days) manner as shown in Fig. S10 and S11.† The stability results of the EL device reveals that the proposed device was highly stable for several hours in a continuous manner and retains its stability in air for several non-continuous days.

Fig. 4 is a schematic (SEM image, schematic diagram and band gap diagram) of the carrier injection sites with only pristine ZnS:Cu,Al, the CNTs/ZnS:Cu,Al composite and the rGO wrapped ZnS:Cu,Al composite. The injection carriers enhance in the case of the exotic forms of carbon due to their interface with the ZnS phosphor. This enhancement in the injection carriers is directly related to the available de-localized π-electrons in the form of unsaturated dangling bonds. On the other hand, in the pure phosphor layer without an exotic form of carbon, the EL originates only at the points of contact for the phosphor with a dielectric layer at which the electrons are injected by the available local electrical field.1,3 It is well known that ZnS highly doped with Cu exists in the form of an ZnS–CuxS–ZnS heterostructure. In the presence of a high electric field, holes from one end and electrons from the other end of the CuxS needles are injected by quantum tunneling into the ZnS lattice. The holes and electrons are then trapped in the Cu recombination and Al donor sites, respectively. The reversal field causes the emitted electrons to recombine with the holes associated with trapped centers to form excitons, the decay of which produces an emission.3,28 The incorporation of CNTs, rGO and other exotic forms of carbon in the phosphor layer can enhance the effective area of carrier injection sites. Subsequently, the large surface area and better interface provides a larger number of injection sites. Furthermore, the exotic forms of carbon such as CNTs and rGO nanosheets provide a thin tunneling barrier. This ultra-thin barrier allows the electrons to tunnel at lower bias voltages, and hence the EL can be observed at a lower bias voltage than those in devices fabricated without an exotic form of carbon.14,28,30,31

However, wrapping rGO nanosheets around the phosphor provides a more effective surface area for the injection carriers compared to CNTs. Therefore, this ZnS:Cu,Al phosphor with the rGO composite used as an emitting layer will result in an increase in the brightness of the EL devices. Thus, this facile synthesis approach using a composite material in the form of an emitting layer as well as an exfoliated h-BN layer as a dielectric material legitimates its potential use in the fabrication of the next generation high performance EL devices.
4. Conclusions
In summary, the fabrication and performance of an AC powered novel EL device using an ZnS:Cu,Al phosphor wrapped rGO as an active emitting layer and exfoliated h-BN layer as an dielectric medium are demonstrated. The device exhibits high-performance EL properties with a brightness of ∼50 cd m−2 at 10 kHz with an AC voltage of 110 V, an external quantum efficiency of ∼6.3% ± 0.1% and current efficiency of ∼0.81 ± 0.09 cd A−1 observed for the ZnS:Cu,Al with 0.50 wt% rGO composite. The EL results suggests that the rGO nanosheet interfaces at ZnS:Cu,Al phosphor provide a large number of injection carrier sites compared to the other exotic forms of carbon and lead to an enhancement in the local electrical field, which results in a relatively low operating voltage and high stability in air for several days compared to the other EL devices made with exotic forms of carbon. Therefore, the ZnS:Cu,Al phosphor and rGO composite used as an emitting layer can make a new generation of EL devices for economically feasible, large scale lighting applications.
