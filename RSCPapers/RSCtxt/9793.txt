    , Accepted 8th October 2010First published on 9th November 2010AbstractA stable C60 derivative bearing an azide functional group has been prepared and used as a building block for the preparation of a fullerene–porphyrin conjugate (F–P–F) by reaction with a Zn(II)–porphyrin bearing two terminal alkyne groups under the copper mediated Huisgen 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition conditions. The electrochemical and photophysical properties of the resulting multicomponent system have been investigated in detail. In benzonitrile, F–P–F undergoes photoinduced electron transfer and the resulting charge separated state is relatively long lived (τ = 0.48 µs). In contrast, intramolecular energy transfer has been evidenced in toluene, with the generation of the fullerene triplet level upon selective excitation of the porphyrin moiety. In this solvent, a CT emission band is observed in the near-infrared region (λmax = 940 nm) as a consequence of a conformational equilibrium causing, to a minor extent, the formation of intramolecular porphyrin–fullerene tight pairs. This finding is supported by measurements of singlet oxygen sensitization and quenching of the long-lived fullerene centered triplet state in the oxygen free solution.
Introduction
Owing to their specific electronic properties, fullerene derivatives are attractive photo- and electro-active components in artificial photosynthetic systems.1–3 Among the numerous fullerene-based photoactive molecular devices reported so far,1 systems combining fullerene accepting moieties with porphyrin donors have generated a great deal of attention.2 Spectacular covalent and non-covalent fullerene–porphyrin conjugates have been already prepared and systematic studies of their electronic properties revealed interesting photoinduced processes.2 Importantly, accelerated charge separation and decelerated charge recombination have been evidenced in a fullerene-based acceptor–donor system when compared to the equivalent benzoquinone-based system.4 This has been interpreted by the smaller reorganization energy (λ) of C60 when compared with those of small acceptors.4 The efficient photogeneration of long lived charge-separated states by photoinduced electron transfer in fullerene–porphyrin systems is particularly interesting for solar energy conversion. Indeed, photovoltaic devices prepared from such hybrid compounds have shown promising energy conversion efficiencies.3 On the other hand, strong attractive fullerene–porphyrin interactions have been evidenced for several covalent and non-covalent C60–porphyrin derivatives,5 as well as in the solid state structures of porphyrin/fullerene co-crystals.6 The establishment of such intramolecular π-stacking interactions between the two chromophores has been demonstrated spectroscopically both in the ground and in the excited state. In particular, charge transfer (CT) excited state levels in the near-infrared (NIR) region have been evidenced, which are typically the funnel of the excitation energy initially addressed to upper electronic states localized on each chromophore.7
As part of this research, we have developed versatile fullerene–benzaldehyde building blocks for the construction of functionalized porphyrins bearing multiple fullerene residues.8 More recently, we have also reported the synthesis of fullerene–porphyrin conjugates from clickable building blocks.9,10 In particular, we have shown that the copper mediated Huisgen 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of organic azides and terminal alkynes11 leading to 1,2,3-triazoles is a perfectly suited tool for fullerene chemistry.12,13 In this paper, we now report a full account on the synthesis of a C60–porphyrin conjugate from a fullerene–azide building block and a porphyrin derivative bearing alkyne units. The electrochemical and photophysical properties of the hybrid compound have been investigated in detail.
Interestingly, a NIR charge transfer emission has been observed in toluene, suggesting that the C60–porphyrin derivative adopts, though to a minor extent, a folded conformation that allows π–π interactions between the fullerene subunits and the central porphyrin moiety. The majority of the molecules adopt a more extended conformation in which photoinduced energy transfer and electron transfer are observed in toluene and benzonitrile, respectively.
Results and discussion
Synthesis
The preparation of the fullerene–azide building block is depicted in Scheme 1. This compound was obtained by taking advantage of the regioselective reaction developed in the group of Diederich,14 which led to macrocyclic bis-adducts of C60 by a cyclization reaction at the fullerene sphere with a bis-malonate derivative in a double Bingel15 cyclopropanation. To this end, we have first prepared bis-malonate 6 bearing an azide group. Reaction of phenol 116 with tosylate 217 and K2CO3 in DMF at 80 °C afforded 3 which after treatment with tetrabutylammonium fluoride (TBAF) gave diol 4. N,N′-Dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC)-mediated esterification of 4 with the malonic mono-ester 518 yielded bis-malonate 6. It is worth noting that the 3,5-didodecyloxybenzyl groups introduced at this stage should prevent any solubility problems for the targeted fullerene derivatives. Indeed, this group has already proven to be an excellent solubilizing group for C60 derivatives.19
 Scheme 1  
Reagents and conditions: (i) K2CO3, LiBr, DMF, 80 °C, 96 h (33%); (ii) TBAF, THF, 0 °C, 3 h (73%); (iii) DCC, DMAP, HOBt, CH2Cl2, 0 °C to rt, 72 h (65%); (iv) C60, DBU, I2, PhMe, rt, 12 h (56%); (v) phenylacetylene, CuSO4·5H2O, sodium ascorbate, CH2Cl2/H2O, rt, 16 h (73%). 
Treatment of C60 with 6, iodine and 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU) in toluene at room temperature afforded the cis-2 bis-adduct 7 in 56% yield. As shown in Fig. 1, the 1H NMR spectrum of 7 reveals the characteristic features of Cs symmetrical 1,3-phenylenebis(methylene)-tethered fullerene cis-2 bis-adducts.20 Effectively, two AB quartets are observed for the two sets of diastereotopic benzylic CH2 groups (H–A/B and H–C/D) and an AX2 system is revealed for the aromatic protons of the 1,3,5-trisubstituted bridging phenyl ring (H-3/4). The 13C NMR spectrum of 7 is also in full accordance with the proposed molecular structure. In particular, four of the resonances seen between δ = 134 and 148 ppm for the different fullerene sp2 C atoms show half intensity (δ = 134.6, 138.0, 147.5 and 147.6). Actually, the latter observation is an unambiguous proof for the Cs symmetry20 of compound 7. Effectively, for such a C60 derivative, there are 26 pairs of equivalent sp2 fullerene C atoms and four unique ones. Additionally, the orange-red color and the UV/Vis spectrum of 7 are fully consistent with those of previously reported analogous cis-2 bis-adducts.21 Indeed, the absorption spectra of C60 bis-adducts are characteristic for each of the regioisomers.14,22 It is also well-established that the 1,3-phenylenebis(methylene)-tethered bis-malonates produce regioselectively the Cs symmetrical cis-2 addition pattern at C60.14,20,21 It is also worth noting that fullerene azide derivative 7 is a quite stable compound under normal laboratory conditions. A sample was stored in the fridge for several months without any detectable decomposition. The latter observation is quite unusual for fullerene–azide derivatives for which intermolecular cycloaddition reactions between the C60 and the azide groups led generally to fast decomposition.12 The remarkable stability of compound 7 may be the result of the encapsulation of the fullerene sphere in its cyclic addend surrounded by two 3,5-didodecylbenzyl ester moieties thus preventing the reaction of the azide group with the C60 core.

The functionalization of building block 7 under the copper-catalyzed 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition was first attempted with phenylacetylene. The reaction conditions were the same as the one we optimized for the click reactions of azides with fullerene–alkyne derivatives.12 Treatment of compound 7 with phenylacetylene in the presence of CuSO4·5H2O and sodium ascorbate in a mixture of CH2Cl2/H2O (1/1) gave the clicked model compound F in 73% yield. As previously observed for click reactions with fullerene-based building blocks, azide cycloaddition on the C60 core does not significantly compete with the alkyne–azide click reaction leading to the 1,2,3-triazole derivatives. Compound F is highly soluble in common organic solvent and was thus easily characterized. The structure of compound F was confirmed by its 1H and 13C NMR spectra as well as by mass spectrometry. Inspection of the 1H NMR spectrum clearly indicates the disappearance of the CH2–azide (H-7) signal at δ = 3.55 ppm (Fig. 1). Importantly, the 1H NMR spectrum of F shows the typical singlet of the 1,2,3-triazole unit (H-8) at δ = 7.80 ppm as well as the signal corresponding to the CH2–triazole protons (H-7) at δ = 4.65 ppm.
The synthesis of the porphyrin building block bearing two clickable terminal alkyne units (12) is depicted in Scheme 2. Compound 823 and dipyrromethane 924 were prepared according to previously reported methods. Porphyrin 10 was obtained by using the reaction conditions developed in the group of Lindsey.25 The condensation of 8 and 9 was performed in CHCl3 (commercial CHCl3 containing 0.75% ethanol as stabilizer) at room temperature in the presence of BF3·Et2O. After 16 hours, p-chloranil (tetrachlorobenzoquinone) was added to irreversibly convert the porphyrinogen to the porphyrin. The desired tetraphenylporphyrin 10 was subsequently isolated in 23% yield. Metalation of 10 with Zn(OAc)2 and treatment of the resulting 11 with TBAF gave compound 12.

Treatment of 12 with fullerene azide 7 in the presence of CuSO4·5H2O and sodium ascorbate gave the targeted fullerene–porphyrin conjugate F–P–F in 64% yield. Inspection of the 1H NMR spectrum of F–P–F (Fig. 1) clearly indicates the disappearance of the terminal alkyne units seen at δ = 3.31 ppm in the starting building block (12) and the appearance of the typical signal of the 1,2,3-triazole units (H-8) at δ = 8.00 ppm. As seen in the case of F, the diagnostic resonance corresponding to the CH2–triazole protons (H-7) is observed at δ = 4.80 ppm. The structure of F–P–F was also confirmed by mass spectrometry. As shown in Fig. 2, the MALDI-TOF mass spectrum of F–P–F displays a singly charged ion peak at m/z = 4898.5 corresponding to the expected molecular ion peak ([M + H]+, calcd for C332H287N10O26Zn: 4898.36). Under our experimental conditions, only a very minor fragment is observed at m/z = 4438.5. The latter is ascribed to [M − C31H55O2]+ as a result of the cleavage of a 3,5-didodecyloxybenzylic ester subunit. It can be noted that this fragmentation is classically observed for such fullerene derivatives.26 However, when compared to mass spectra recorded under much harsher FAB conditions, the fragmentation is very limited in the MALDI-TOF mass spectrum thus showing that the latter technique is an ideal tool for the characterization of such high molecular weight compounds.

The conformation adopted by compound F–P–F is an important issue for a better understanding of the photophysical properties. Indeed, the flexible linkers between the central porphyrin moiety and the two peripheral fullerene subunits may allow for either a fully extended or a folded conformation. The calculated structure of compound F–P–F depicted in Fig. 3 reveals that π-stacking interactions between the fullerene moieties and the central porphyrinic core take place in a folded conformation. Such attractive interactions between fullerenes and porphyrins have been already observed for several covalent and non-covalent C60–porphyrin conjugates5 and may contribute to stabilize the folded conformation in the case of F–P–F. This view is indeed supported by the 2D NOESY spectrum of F–P–F recorded in CDCl3 at room temperature (Fig. S1†). Effectively, correlation peaks are observed between the 1,2,3-triazole proton (H-8) and both CH2-5 and CH2-7 groups of the propylene linker (see Fig. 1 for the numbering of the protons). The latter observation clearly reveals that CH2-5 is spatially close to proton H-8. This is obviously possible only if compound F–P–F adopts a folded conformation. In the calculated structure, the distance between proton H-8 and its closest neighbor in the CH2-5 unit is 3.29 Å for one 1,2,3-triazole ring and 4.36 Å for the other one in perfect agreement with the observed NOE effects. Further correlation peaks observed between the protons of the mesityl groups (CH3 and H-a) and some of the CH2 moieties of the dodecyl chains are also consistent with a folded conformation. However, compound F–P–F being not a rigid molecule, this conclusion refers not to a fixed structure but to an energetically preferred conformation in this particular solvent (CDCl3) resulting from attractive intramolecular fullerene–porphyrin interactions. It can be noted that the occurrence of such interactions is further supported by (i) the slight red-shift observed for the Soret band in the absorption spectrum of F–P–F when compared to model porphyrin P, and (ii) the observation of a NIR charge transfer emission upon photoexcitation in toluene (vide infra).

Electrochemistry
The electrochemical properties of F–P–F were determined by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and Osteryoung Square Wave Voltammetry (OSWV). For the sake of comparison, electrochemical measurements have also been carried out with F, 12 and P. All the experiments were performed at room temperature in CH2Cl2 solutions containing tetra-n-butylammonium tetrafluoroborate (0.1 M) as supporting electrolyte and ferrocene (Fc) as internal reference, with a Pt wire as the working electrode and a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as a reference. Potential data for all of the compounds are collected in Table 1. As typical examples, the cyclic voltammogram and the OSWVs (cathodic and anodic scans) of compound F–P–F are depicted in Fig. 4.

In the cathodic region, model compound F shows the classical behavior observed for fullerene cis-2 bis-adducts.27 In addition to the observation of the three successive reductions of the fullerene unit, reduction peaks of electrogenerated products formed after the second reduction are also observed at −1.15 and −1.57 V vs. SCE (Fig. S2†). This specific behaviour of cyclopropanated fullerenes is most probably due to a bond breaking in the cyclopropane ring, known as the retro-Bingel reaction.28 In the anodic region, model compound F shows two irreversible peaks which can be likely attributed to the oxidation of the dialkyloxyphenyl and/or 4-phenyl-1,2,3-triazol units.29 Model compounds 12 and P display the characteristic electrochemical behaviour of Zn(II)–porphyrin derivatives30 with two quasi-reversible porphyrin-centered one-electron transfer processes in both the cathodic and the anodic regions (Fig. S3†). The voltammograms recorded for hybrid compound F–P–F show the characteristic electrochemical features of both constitutive units, i.e. fullerene and Zn(II)–porphyrin. The comparison of the redox potentials of F–P–F with the corresponding model compounds clearly shows that the two first reduction waves correspond to fullerene-centered processes, while the two first oxidation processes are centered on the porphyrin core. The third reduction peak is ascribed to the electrogenerated products formed after the second reduction as observed in the case of F. The fourth reduction process probably contains contributions from both C60 and porphyrin moieties. Finally, the fifth peak corresponds most likely to a fullerene-centered reduction. As shown in Fig. 4, the two fullerene subunits behave as independent redox centers and the relative intensity of the first fullerene-reduction relative to the first porphyrin-based oxidation is in the expected 2:1 ratio. Comparison of the redox potentials values of F–P–F with those of the corresponding model compounds F and P reveals only a minor influence of the fullerene subunits on the porphyrin moiety and vice versa. This observation, however, does not indicate the absence of intramolecular fullerene–porphyrin interactions (vide supra). Effectively, redox potentials of fullerene–donor conjugates are generally very weakly affected by intramolecular π–π interactions even in cyclic systems in which the two components are forced to be at the van der Waals contact.31
Ground state absorption and luminescence properties
The electronic absorption spectra of model compounds F and P, and fullerene–porphyrin conjugate F–P–F in toluene are shown in Fig. 5. Below 390 nm, the fullerene absorption is stronger than that of the porphyrin, whereas in the visible spectral region an opposite pattern is observed. The spectrum of P is quite similar to that of Zn(II) meso-tetraphenylporphyrin (ZnTPP).32 This is an expected result since the side group on the meso-phenyl rings does not affect much the delocalization of the porphyrin π-systems. The maximum of the Soret band, corresponding to the transition to the second singlet excited state, is located at 424 nm (ε = 521000 M−1 cm−1) in toluene.
 Fig. 5  Absorption spectra of F–P–F (grey), F (dotted black), and P (black) in toluene solution at 298 K; insets (i) zoom of Q band region and (ii) absorption spectra of F–P–F in NIR region at various concentrations ([F–P–F] = 7.4–46 µM). 
In the UV region, the absorption spectrum of F–P–F exhibits minor differences when compared with the sum of the spectra of the corresponding model compounds. In contrast, significant differences can be observed in the Vis region. In particular, a slight red-shift (λmax = 426 nm) as well as an intensity decrease of the Soret band (ε = 434000 M−1 cm−1) are observed. This may suggest some interactions between at least one of two fullerenes with the porphyrin macrocycle. This kind of behavior has been typically found in systems with a face-to-face porphyrin–fullerene interchromophoric arrangement.1f Compared to the algebraic sum of the components, F–P–F also exhibits a concentration-independent weak tail of the absorption profile above 650 nm, which is a further clue for ground state charge transfer interaction between the two chromophores, in line with previous reports (Fig. 5).7
The most relevant luminescence data for all the investigated compounds are reported in Table 2, where the emission maxima refer to the spectra corrected for the detector response.

In toluene solution at room temperature, P exhibits a fluorescence band (λmax = 645 nm, τS = 2.1 ns, Φfl = 2.4%); at 77 K both fluorescence and phosphorescence are detected (Table 2 and Fig. 6). The porphyrin fluorescence intensity of F–P–F is quenched by about 75% when compared to P at 298 K (Table 2), and the lifetime is accordingly reduced from 2.1 to 1.0 ns, corresponding to a quenching rate constant of 5.2 × 108 s−1. The quenching process can be attributed to singlet energy transfer to the fullerene moiety, in line with literature reports for analogous multichromophoric fullerene–porphyrin systems in apolar media;3 this hypothesis will be verified in the next sections. In F–P–F the porphyrin quenching turns out to be relatively slow compared to previously investigated similar arrays due to the long through bond distance between the energy donor and acceptor, assuming an extended conformation. Also a weak phosphorescence signal (quenched by about 65%) is still observable for F–P–F (λmax = 775 nm, τT = 20 ms) at 77 K. The typical weak fluorescence band is observed for the bismethanofullerene reference compound F (λmax = 700 nm, τS = 1.6 ns). This band cannot be observed in F–P–F because of the spectral overlapping with the residual porphyrin emission, still much more intense, even when excitation is addressed mainly to the fullerene moiety (λexc = 380 nm).

In benzonitrile solution at room temperature, the porphyrin fluorescence is quenched to a similar extent as in toluene, both in intensity and lifetime (Table 2), also suggesting a relatively slow quenching process, as found in toluene. Interestingly, the porphyrin phosphorescence at low temperature in this solvent could not be detected for F–P–F.
Singlet oxygen sensitization and NIR emission
In order to trace the formation of porphyrin and/or fullerene triplets,26a we measured the sensitized singlet oxygen (1O2*) luminescence at 1270 nm in toluene (Fig. S4†).33 Setting meso-tetraphenylporphyrin (TPP) as standard, which displays a singlet oxygen sensitization yield (ΦΔ) equal to 0.7034 in toluene solution, we measured values of 0.70 for P, 0.60 for F and 0.45 for F–P–F. The formation of singlet oxygen in F–P–F is in line with the finding of extensive formation of fullerene triplet in toluene by transient absorption spectroscopy (vide infra). By contrast, no sensitized 1O2* luminescence is detected in benzonitrile solution by exciting F–P–F (Fig. S4†). This suggests that different photoinduced processes occur in the multicomponent array in the two solvents, as it will be evidenced by transient absorption studies.
Interestingly, F–P–F exhibits a weak and broad emission band centered at ca. 950 nm in toluene solution (Fig. 7); its faint intensity prevented the determination of the lifetime. In analogy with previous findings in face-to-face porphyrin–fullerene systems1f,7 this band is attributed to an emitting charge transfer state that can be generated by a minority of F–P–F systems, in the frame of a dynamic equilibrium, in which the two chromophores are in a close edge-to-face conformation. The excitation spectrum of F–P–F taken at 950 nm showed the typical spectral features of a porphyrin moiety, and particularly the diagnostic Soret band at ca. 420 nm and Q bands at 550 nm. This rules out that the observed NIR band is due to exciplex emission and suggests that the porphyrin excited states are partly deactivated to a low-lying CT level. The fact that the absorption tail above 650 nm (ε = 375 M−1 cm−1) is weaker than those previously observed1f,7 suggests that only a minor fraction of molecules are involved in the edge-to-face interactions, contrary to what happened in face-to-face systems where molecules engaged in CT interactions are the large majority.7a In benzonitrile solution, under steady state irradiation at the porphyrin Q bands, no NIR emission such as that in Fig. 7 is detected for F–P–F. This is not surprising since CT luminescence has never been observed previously for face-to-face systems in this solvent, due to the energy gap law (lower CT energy, faster nonradiative deactivation rates) or to the fact that the charge recombination (CR) process of the porphyrin–fullerene pairs is highly exergonic and lies in the Marcus inverted region.1f Under this regime, CR processes are expected to be faster in more polar media (i.e. benzonitrile vs. toluene), owing to a decrease of the activation energy for charge recombination.35

In summary, F–P–F shows clear evidence of interchromophoric excited state interactions. The porphyrin centered fluorescence is quenched, while a new CT emission band in the near infrared spectral region is recorded in toluene solution. However, the main deactivation pathway in apolar toluene leads to the formation of the fullerene triplet, which most likely occurs through porphyrin → fullerene singlet energy transfer, followed by regular intersystem crossing within the carbon sphere, as observed in many fullerene dyads.26a
Transient absorption spectroscopy
The nanosecond transient absorption spectrum of P (Fig. S5†) shows the typical zinc porphyrin triplet absorption spectra (λmax = 460 nm); its lifetime is 177 and 130 µs in deoxygenated benzonitrile and toluene solutions, respectively. The nanosecond transient absorption spectrum of F in benzonitrile (Fig. S5†) shows the characteristic triplet–triplet absorption band (λmax = 720 nm).36 A first order decay with a lifetime of 24 µs is found, which corresponds to the non-radiative T1 → S0 deactivation process of F.
The shape of the nanosecond transient absorption spectrum of F–P–F in benzonitrile (Fig. 8) is very different from that of its model compounds. Immediately after excitation of F–P–F with 560 nm laser pulse, where the porphyrin component is selectively excited with a ratio of about 10:1 with respect to fullerene, the bleaching of the ground state porphyrin Q-bands at 550 and 600 nm and an intense absorption of the porphyrin triplet at 470 nm are recorded. With an increase of delay time, spectral changes in the absorptions at ca. 650 and 1005 nm arise and decay simultaneously with τ = 0.48 µs (Fig. 8). We assign the absorption band around 650 nm to zinc porphyrin radical cation (ZnP˙+)37 and that around 1005 nm to the bismethanofullerene radical anion (C60˙−),38 respectively. The identical lifetimes, within the experimental uncertainty, indicate that the same species is monitored, namely the charge separated state. The rise time of the charge separated state is about 20 ns, which rules out the role of the singlet levels as reacting species and indicates that the ion pair is formed by the fullerene triplet. This is fully reasonable on the basis of the electrochemical data, which indicate that the energy of the charge separated state is 1.44 eV in CH2Cl2, and must be somewhat lower in more polar benzonitrile, which is compatible with a triplet energy of bismethanofullerenes of 1.40 eV.26a Indeed the porphyrin centred triplet state is detected at around 480 nm in F–P–F, which decays with τ ≈ 30 ns; this suggests some residual electron transfer from the porphyrin centered triplet state, populated via intersystem crossing. The absence of formation of long-lived triplet species either in the porphyrin or the fullerene chromophores, is verified by the absence of sensitized singlet oxygen luminescence at 1270 nm in air equilibrated benzonitrile solution (see ESI†) as well as by the lack of phosphorescence at 77 K (vide supra).
 Fig. 8  Top: transient absorption spectra of F–P–F (A = 0.350) in oxygen-free benzonitrile. Depicted spectral traces are at 0.1, 0.16, 0.34, 0.70, 2.5 µs (from bigger to smaller circles) after the laser pulse. Inset: absorption decay at 650 nm. λexc = 560 nm. Energy: 1.0 mJ per pulse. Bottom: transient absorption spectra of F–P–F  (A = 0.350) in oxygen-free toluene. Depicted spectral traces are at 0.1, 1.2, 2.8, 5.3, 16 µs (from bigger to smaller circles) after the laser pulse. Inset: absorption decay at 720 nm. λexc = 560 nm. Energy: 2.0 mJ per pulse. 
For F–P–F in toluene, no charge separated state is detected in the nanosecond regime (Fig. 8). In a timescale below our experimental resolution, i.e. less than 10 ns, the growth of the fullerene triplet is detected at 720 nm, upon excitation of the porphyrin moiety. This dynamics is compatible with the quenching of the porphyrin singlet detected via fluorescence spectroscopy (k = 5.2 × 108 s−1, see above). The fact that (i) the quenched porphyrin singlet lifetimes are identical in toluene and benzonitrile, despite a completely different excited state reactivity and (ii) singlet levels do not feed electron transfer in benzonitrile are robust clues for porphyrin → fullerene singlet energy transfer in both media as the primary photoinduced event.
The fullerene triplet lifetime is 3.8 and 0.34 µs in deoxygenated and air-equilibrated solution, respectively. Interestingly, the fullerene triplet lifetime of F–P–F (3.8 µs) is significantly reduced relative to that of the model fullerene F (20 µs) in oxygen-free solution. This suggests that a dynamic quenching of the long lived fullerene triplet states in F–P–F occurs, with a rate constant of 2.1 × 105 s−1. This could be a consequence of a dynamic equilibrium that, on the microsecond timescale, would allow the deactivation of the fullerene triplet states in F–P–F with an extended conformation (majority) to the lower-lying CT species (minority).7a To further strengthen the hypothesis of such a dynamic equilibrium between compact and extended conformations, it can be noted that the ΦΔ value of F–P–F (0.45) is slightly smaller than that of F (0.60), again suggesting the presence of a minority of CT states that are known to be incapable of sensitizing the formation of 1O2*.35
The photoinduced intramolecular processes evidenced for F–P–F in both solvents (toluene and benzonitrile) can be summarized as follows. In toluene, no long lived charge separated state could be detected by nanosecond transient absorption spectroscopy. On the other hand, efficient singlet energy transfer from the porphyrin to the fullerene excited states followed by population of the fullerene triplet level is evidenced by time resolved absorption and luminescence experiments. The triplet state character of the observed excited state was further confirmed by the singlet oxygen sensitization measurements. Moreover, a porphyrin–fullerene charge transfer interaction was evidenced by a broad and weak emission band at around 940 nm. This kind of interaction can only be set up through very tight porphyrin/fullerene pair configurations, which, in the present case can be only face-to-edge and not face-to-face as observed previously.1f This species is present only as a minor fraction, in the frame of a dynamic equilibrium. The quenching of the fullerene centred triplet state in F–P–F in oxygen free solution is also a good indication of this hypothesis. In benzonitrile, no emission in the NIR region could be detected, but photoinduced electron transfer was unambiguously evidenced, since the free-radical ions P˙+ and F˙− were identified by flash spectroscopy.
Conclusions
In conclusion, we have developed a stable C60 derivative bearing an azide functional group allowing its further functionalization by reaction with terminal alkynes under the copper mediated Huisgen 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition conditions. This building block has been used for the preparation of fullerene–porphyrin conjugate F–P–F by reaction with a Zn(II)–porphyrin bearing two terminal alkyne units. Molecular modeling and 2D NOESY experiments on the resulting hybrid system have revealed a folded conformation stabilized by intramolecular π-stacking interactions between the fullerene moieties and the central porphyrinic core. The electrochemical properties of hybrid compound F–P–F have been investigated. Whereas the first reduction is centered on the C60 unit, the oxidation is centered on the porphyrin moiety. Photophysical studies revealed strong excited state interactions between the different components in F–P–F. Indeed, intramolecular photoinduced processes have been evidenced by steady-state fluorescence spectroscopy and time-resolved absorption and luminescence techniques. In a polar solvent such as benzonitrile, F–P–F undergoes an efficient photoinduced electron transfer from both fullerene and porphyrin triplet levels. The resulting charge separated state is relatively long lived (τ = 0.48 µs). In contrast, intramolecular energy transfer has been evidenced in apolar toluene. Interestingly, a conformational equilibrium allowing an intramolecular porphyrin–fullerene π–π interaction is responsible for the dynamic quenching of the fullerene centered triplet state that populates a CT state from which a NIR emission could be detected.

Electrochemistry
The cyclic voltammetric measurements were carried out with a potentiostat Autolab PGSTAT100. Experiments were performed at room temperature in a homemade airtight three-electrode cell connected to a vacuum/argon line. The reference electrode consisted of a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) separated from the solution by a bridge compartment. The counter electrode was a platinum wire of ca. 1 cm2 apparent surface. The working electrode was a Pt microdisk (0.5 mm diameter). The supporting electrolyte [n-Bu4N][BF4] (Fluka, 99% electrochemical grade) was used as received and simply degassed under argon. Dichloromethane was freshly distilled over CaH2 prior to use. The solutions used during the electrochemical studies were typically 10−3 M in compound and 0.1 M in supporting electrolyte. Before each measurement, the solutions were degassed by bubbling Ar and the working electrode was polished with a polishing machine (Presi P230). Under these experimental conditions, Fc+/Fc is observed at +0.55 ± 0.01 V vs. SCE.
Photophysics
The photophysical studies were carried out in benzonitrile and toluene (Carlo Erba, spectrofluorimetric grade). Absorption spectra were recorded with a Perkin-Elmer Lambda 950 UV/Vis/NIR spectrophotometer. Molar absorption values (ε) were calculated by applying the Lambert–Beer law to the absorbance spectra (Amax < 0.7) of the compounds.
Steady-state photoluminescence spectra were measured in right angle mode with an Edinburgh FLS920 spectrometer (continuous 450 W Xe lamp), equipped with a Peltier-cooled Hamamatsu R928 photomultiplier tube (185–850 nm) or a Hamamatsu R5509-72 supercooled photomultiplier tube (193 K, 800–1700 nm range). The concentration of air-equilibrated sample solutions was adjusted to obtain absorption values A < 0.15 at the excitation wavelength. Emission quantum yields were determined according to the approach described by Demas and Crosby,39 using [Ru(bipy)3Cl2] (Φem = 0.028 in air-equilibrated water solution)40 as standard. One centimetre path length square optical Suprasil Quartz (QS) cuvettes were used for measurements at RT of dilute solutions, while capillary tubes immersed in liquid nitrogen in a coldfinger quartz Dewar were used for measurements of solvent frozen glasses at 77 K.
Fluorescence lifetimes were measured with an IBH 5000F time-correlated single-photon counting device, by using pulsed NanoLED excitation sources at 331, 373, 465 and 560 nm. Analysis of the luminescence decay profiles against time was accomplished with the Decay Analysis Software DAS6 provided by the manufacturer.
Phosphorescence spectra and decays were measured at 77 K in solvent frozen dilute solutions on a Perkin-Elmer LS-50B spectrofluorimeter equipped with a pulsed Xe lamp and in gated detection mode. The phosphorescence decay analysis was performed with the PHOSDecay software provided by the manufacturer. All spectra are acquired under the same experimental condition.
Transient absorption spectra in the nanosecond–microsecond time domain were obtained by using the nanosecond flash photolysis apparatus Proteus by Ultrafast Systems LLC. The excitation source was a tunable laser system made by a optical parametric oscillator (Continuum Surelite OPO PLUS) pumped by the second harmonic (532 or 355 nm) of a Continuum Surelite II Nd:YAG laser with 5 ns pulse duration at 0.1–10 mJ per pulse. Light signals were passed through a Chromex/Bruker 500IS monochromator (equipped with two gratings blazed at 600 or 1200 nm), and collected on a high-speed Silicon (DET210) or InGaAs (DET410) Thorlabs detector in the Vis (400–800 nm) and NIR (800–1700 nm) regions, respectively. The signal was then amplified by means of a variable gain wideband voltage amplifier (Femto DHPVA-200) interfaced with a Tektronix TDS 3032B digital oscilloscope connected to a PC having the acquisition software Proteus. The probe light source was a 150 W CW Xe Arc lamp Spectra Physics 69907. Triplet lifetimes were obtained by averaging 64 or 132 different decays recorded around the maximum of the absorption peak (e.g. 720 nm). The samples were placed in fluorimetric 1 cm path cuvettes and, when necessary, purged from oxygen by at least 4 freeze–thaw–pump cycles. Typical laser power has been taken as 0.5 mJ per pulse which, taking into account the photon energy at 650 nm, the concentration of the sample, and the volume of solution effectively excited, leads to an excitation of about 10% of the overall fullerene molecules, thus making negligible the chance of multiple excitation events within compounds.
All measurements were carried out in spectroscopy grade solvents, used without further purification. Experimental uncertainties are estimated to be 8% for lifetime determinations, 20% for emission quantum yields, 5% for relative emission intensities in the NIR, and <1 and <5 nm for absorption and emission peaks respectively.
