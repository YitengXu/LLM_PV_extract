    , Accepted 3rd February 2017First published on 3rd February 2017AbstractThis paper presents for the first time a novel method of depositing plasmonic Bi nanoparticles on BiOCl nanosheets (Bi/BiOCl) via insitu photoelectroreduction, and Bi/BiOCl as the photocathode enabled solar water splitting in a TiO2–Bi/BiOCl photoelectrochemical (PEC) system. It is one of the challenges to understand the relationship between the PEC performance and the composite ratio of Bi/BiOCl, and the density functional theory calculation results show that charges obviously transfer from the Bi cluster to the BiOCl (001) surface. The structure of Bi/BiOCl photocathode has been successfully optimized, according to the current–potential curves and charge injection efficiency. The highly enhanced PEC activity could be attributed to the dual roles of Bi nanoparticles in enhancing the charge transfer and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) effect. More importantly, the optimal Bi/BiOCl photocathode achieved a solar hydrogen evolution rate of 2.4 µmol h−1 under full spectrum illumination (100 mW cm−2).
1. Introduction
Since the discovery of photoelectrochemical (PEC) devices for hydrogen production,1,2 PEC technology has been attracting massive research interest for solar-to-hydrogen (STH) conversion due to the increasing importance of reducing the dependence on fossil fuels and achieving a more sustainable economy.3 Titanium dioxide (TiO2) is considered as the earliest semiconductor for solar-driven hydrogen evolution from water, taking advantage of its band gap, which straddles the oxidation and reduction potentials of water.4 However, the most pronounced disadvantage of TiO2 of its poor response to ultraviolet (UV) light (only about 5% of sunlight) significantly limits its overall efficiency,5,6 so the poor performance of bare TiO2 photoelectrodes has been become a key issue.7
Numerous methods have been employed to enhance the overall PEC efficiency, which was resolved by depressing the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes in the hydrogen production process by PEC water splitting. The above challenge can be best exemplified by optimizing the anode with noble metal modification,8,9 defect implantation,10,11 and element doping.12,13 However, the PEC water splitting process is governed by both the photoanode and the photocathode, while Pt photocathodes replaced by semiconductors are considered as another feasible way to improve PEC efficiency.14,15 Several p-type semiconductors have been utilised as PEC photocathodes (or counter electrodes), which enables the p-type semiconductors to be practical alternatives to Pt metal.16,17 p-Type semiconductors as photocathodes play some intrinsic roles compared with traditional Pt electrodes in enhancing the solar-to-chemical energy conversion efficiency, because p-type semiconductors can facilitate electrons injection into photocathodes via the external circuit in PEC water splitting, and the desired microstructure can be artificially designed and fabricated for simultaneous H2 production. Moreover, p-type semiconductor photocathodes can further realize the re-absorption of solar light to enhance the utilization efficiency of solar light.18,19 However, the application of p-type semiconductors as photocathodes is still faced with challenges, such as low hydrogen generation rate, an obvious decay for long-term photo-response, and high cost in PEC hydrogen generation.20 Therefore, the low cost design of novel p-type photocathodes is necessary to achieve outstanding PEC properties.
BiOX has been considered as a promising layered semiconductor in the field of photocatalysis for environmental purification of hazardous pollutants and PEC water splitting.21,22 The layered structure of BiOX possesses a fluorite-like [X–Bi–O–Bi–X] sandwiched between two slabs of halogen ions along the [001] direction,23,24 and it can offer high specific surface areas for polarization of atomic orbitals.25 In addition, a recent report also proves that BiOX exhibits unique and excellent performance, which is attributed to its indirect-transition band-gap to enhance the induced dipole and reduce the recombination rate of the excited electron and hole.26 BiOCl nanosheets have shown significant potential for PEC water splitting, but its wide band gap (about 3.6 eV) contrarily depresses the absorption of visible light.27 An appealing approach is to implant bismuth nanoparticles on the surface of BiOCl to extend the absorption range based on the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) effect and efficiently separate the electron–hole pairs.28,29
In this paper, we have realized PEC water splitting by using the TiO2 nanorods as the photoanode and BiOCl nanosheets modified with Bi as photocathode. The Bi/BiOCl nanosheets were fabricated through facile in situ reduction method, and the PEC activity of Bi/BiOCl photocathode was systematically investigated under UV and visible light irradiation for optimal water splitting. We demonstrate that Bi/BiOCl nanosheets can facilitate charge transfer and show excellent PEC performance. The unique composite heterostructure of the Bi/BiOCl nanosheets has been proved to obviously improve PEC water splitting, and thus it could become an attractive candidate for practical PEC hydrogen generation.
2. Results and discussion
We first grew ultrathin BiOCl nanosheets on FTO glass substrate using a chemical bath deposition (CBD) method.30In situ photoelectroreduced Bi/BiOCl nanosheets were prepared in a three electrode isolated system with an applied bias to produce Bi nanoparticles on the BiOCl nanosheets surface (Fig. 1a). The thus-obtained Bi nanoparticles decorated on BiOCl nanosheets are denoted as photocathode materials in the PEC device for water splitting (Fig. 1b). The combination of two semiconductor photoelectrodes with different bandgaps could further make full use of the solar light (Fig. 1c).

The detailed crystalline phase structure of the as-synthesized samples was investigated with XRD. As shown in Fig. 2, diffraction peaks at 36° can be doubtlessly ascribed to the reflection of the (101) planes, where the diffraction peaks can be well indexed to TiO2.31 No other impurity peaks were detected, indicating that the pure TiO2 is successfully synthesized on FTO substrate by the hydrothermal method. All the diffraction peaks can be indexed to BiOCl (JCPDS No. 06-0249),32 and chemical conversion from sectional BiOCl to Bi can be further identified from the diverse diffraction peaks after the in situ photoelectroreduction, which agreed well with Bi (JCPDS No. 44-1246).33

The morphology and microscopic structure information of as-synthesized samples were characterized via SEM image (Fig. S1†). The SEM image in Fig. S1a† show that TiO2 nanorods (ca. 100 nm) have been successfully synthesized. More importantly, the morphology of BiOCl could be adjusted by controlling the deposited cycles times. According to, BiOCl forms uniform nanosheets with up to 50 cycles, and the regularity of BiOCl nanosheets (thickness: 120 nm) will decrease if excessive BiOCl has been deposited. Furthermore, the photoelectroreduction route was used to in situ fabricate a Bi/BiOCl heterostructure over a BiOCl sample. SEM images (Fig. S2†) reveal that the nanosheet morphology of BiOCl with 75 cycles (BiOCl/75) remained after the photoelectroreduction process. The EDX elemental spectrum of the Bi/BiOCl heterostructure is presented in Fig. S1f,† which clearly reveals the existence of O, Cl and Bi elements. However, the significantly lower peak intensity for Cl element is ascribed to partial BiOCl nanosheets being reduced to metallic Bi resulting in the loss of Cl element. It is also meaningful to investigate the influence of the photoelectroreduction time on the morphology of the Bi/BiOCl heterostructure (Fig. S3†), since the morphology of Bi/BiOCl could be directly altered by the quantity of Bi. Therefore, the synthesis parameters play an important role in the components and structure of the sample, and it is important to learn the relationship between the altered structure and the PEC performance. Cross-sectional views of samples show that the thicknesses of BiOCl and Bi/BiOCl are ca. 375 nm and 350 nm (Fig. S4†), respectively, which indicates that photoelectroreduction process did not cause the loss of BiOCl film after in situ deposition.
TEM provides in-depth morphology and microstructure information for Bi/BiOCl, as shown in Fig. 3. It can be observed that Bi/BiOCl was constructed as ultrathin nanosheets, which feature a typical 2D structure and benefit from a large specific interface area for electrolytes. HR-TEM images of the Bi/BiOCl heterostructure display distinct lattice fringes with a lattice spacing of 0.73 owing to (001) lattices of the ultrathin BiOCl nanosheets. The corresponding live fast Fourier transform (FFT) pattern (Fig. 3c) of Bi/BiOCl reveals that there are two main lattice types, which can be assigned to Bi and BiOCl. It is obvious that the Bi nanoparticles with very small size (range from 3 to 8 nm, Fig. 3d) have been in situ deposited on the surface of BiOCl nanosheets, and the 0.33 nm lattice fringes correspond to the (012) facets of metallic Bi nanoparticles.34–37 The results indicate that ultrathin BiOCl nanosheets and Bi nanoparticles have been integrated with an intimate interfacial contact.

The light absorption properties of BiOCl and Bi/BiOCl were investigated by UV-vis absorption analysis (Fig. S5a†). BiOCl just exhibits absorption in the UV light region, which corresponds to the big band gap of BiOCl. However, modification of plasmonic Bi nanoparticles can significantly extend the light absorption range to the visible region, owing to the SPR property of Bi, as previously reported.38,39 The Kubelka–Munk function plots (Fig. S5b†) based on the UV-vis absorption reveal that the band gap of bare BiOCl is 3.6 eV, which well agrees with a previous report.27 Bi/BiOCl shows two significant band gaps, which can be assigned to Bi (1.5 eV) and BiOCl (3.1 eV); the decrease of the band gap for BiOCl may be caused by defects since the reduction of BiOCl could induce some losses of oxygen atoms, resulting in the oxygen vacancies inside the BiOCl matrix.40 Therefore, EPR and XPS spectra (Fig. S6†) were further investigated in order to study the oxygen status in the sample in depth. The g = 2.003 of EPR spin spectra could correspond to the typical signal of oxygen vacancies in the matrix,41 and the XPS peak at 532 eV obviously increased relative to the peak at 530 eV, which suggests that the number of oxygen deficient regions has risen compared with bare BiOCl.42 Therefore, the reduction process has introduced some oxygen vacancies in the BiOCl matrix, and it is reasonable that oxygen vacancies further push the visible light absorption of Bi/BiOCl in this system.
A linear relationship of 1/C2versus applied potential was observed in Fig. 4a, and the negative slope of Bi/BiOCl corresponds to a p-type semiconductor.43,44 Scanning capacitance microscopy (SCM) measurements were further employed to determine the charge-trapping properties of the semiconductor. SCM data also confirmed that the whole region of Bi/BiOCl film can be attributed to a p-type semiconductor compared with the SRAM standard sample (Fig. 4b and c and Fig. S7†), which agrees well with the above Mott–Schottky curve.45 The combination of Mott–Schottky plots and SCM images can accurately reveal that Bi/BiOCl has been synthesized as a p-type semiconductor. Moreover, the flat band potential (Vfb) of Bi/BiOCl (Vfb = 2.3 eV) is a positive shift compared with bare BiOCl (Vfb = 1.9 eV, Fig. S8†). The work function of Bi (4.22 eV) is lower than the Fermi levels (Ef) of both BiOCl and H+/H2, and the buried junction will be constructed from Bi and BiOCl, which will make a larger band bend during the interface equilibrium and result in the larger Vfb of Bi/BiOCl.

Linear-sweep-voltammetry (LSV) for Pt, BiOCl and Bi/BiOCl photocathodes in combination with TiO2 photoanodes was studied (Fig. 5a and b). The photocurrent density in the dark tended towards zero (dash lines), and the photocurrent densities increased under illumination, which indicates that the photoelectrode effectively responds to light. What is more, the photocurrent density increased about 10 times under 100 mW cm−2 illumination intensity compared to that under 50 mW cm−2 illumination, suggesting that photocurrent density has been mainly controlled by the transfer of photogenerated charges but not only by the ions' diffusion in the electrolyte. After Pt was replaced by BiOCl as the photocathode, the BiOCl photocathode showed better photocurrent performance, ascribed to BiOCl not only as a conductor to transfer carriers but also promoting carrier mobility capability vested with electronic structures (p-type semiconductor). Additionally, the photocell coupled by TiO2 and Bi/BiOCl showed the highest photocurrent density. The explanation for this is that Bi nanoparticles deposited in situ on BiOCl possess highly enhanced activity as a result of the cooperative contribution of the SPR effect to improve the solar light harvesting efficiency and facilitate charge transfer. The behavior of Bi nanoparticles as a co-catalyst for enhancing PEC activity is similar to that of other noble metals in PEC devices.46 Different deposition cycles also play a role in the photocurrent performance of Bi/BiOCl. As can be seen from the I–V measurements (Fig. 5c and d), the number of cycles exhibits an obvious effect on the photocurrent density. When the number of cycles is increased to 75, the Bi/BiOCl photocathode exhibits the highest photocurrent intensity, which is attributed to the rugged surface, which increases the interface. However, the excess accumulation of self-assembled nanosheets will contrarily hinder the electron transfer, as the number of cycles is up to 100.

The deposition amount of co-catalyst is an important parameter for enhancing PEC activities in composite systems, and therefore Bi/BiOCl/75 with different amounts of Bi nanoparticles was synthesized by controlling photoelectroreduction time (Fig. 6). It is clear that the photocurrent densities increased first and then decreased with an increase of the amount of Bi nanoparticles, suggesting that the amount of Bi nanoparticles deposited in situ on BiOCl/75 can generate very efficient PEC performance. The optimal steady photocurrent density was accomplished by photoelectroreduction for 2 h under 50 and 100 mW cm−2 full spectrum illumination, which indicates that certain Bi nanoparticles can enhance solar-driven hydrogen production. Moreover, the photocurrent density measured on the Bi/BiOCl/75/2 h photocathode is 1.6 mA cm−2, which is almost 8 times that of the TiO2–Pt photocell (0.8 V vs. Ag/AgCl). However, further extending the photoelectroreduction time resulted in rapid decay of photocurrent density because excessive Bi nanoparticles would shield the exposed area and decrease the responding ability of BiOCl. The transient photocurrent responded with intermittent light (Fig. S9†), which also reveals that the Bi/BiOCl/75/2 h sample exhibits the best photoresponding performance compared with Pt and BiOCl. Taking account of in-depth cross experiment analysis (Fig. S10†), the obtained optimal photocathode can be identified as Bi/BiOCl/75/2 h.

EIS analysis was performed to further investigate the intrinsic and inter-domain charge transfer processes, and the results are displayed in Fig. 7a. The equivalent circuit-fitting results (Table S1†) further show that the Rsc value decreased after replacing the Pt by BiOCl, which demonstrates that the introduction of BiOCl can effectively benefit the charge transfer at the semiconductor and electrolyte interface as a result of the p-type semiconductor properties of BiOCl.47,48 Among the three kinds of system, TiO2–Bi/BiOCl/75/2 h presents the smallest Rsc, since the implantation of Bi nanoparticles significantly reduced the charge transfer resistance of BiOCl.

The charge injection efficiency analysis is an important route to understand the process of charge recombination and injection into the electrolyte. On the basis of the measuring photocurrent experiments, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) was added to the electrolyte to harvest the photogenerated holes according to previous reports.49 Therefore, the charge injection efficiency (Pcharge injection) is a product of the ratio of the photocurrent density measured in the presence and absence of H2O2 (photocurrent density is denoted as Jphotocurrent and ). The corresponding equation is:50 (1)
As the results show in Fig. 7b, it is clear that the charge injection efficiency of the TiO2–BiOCl/75 and TiO2–Bi/BiOCl/75/2 h photocells were higher than that of traditional TiO2–Pt photocell. The BiOCl can be used as photocathode to improve the injection capability and enhance the separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs as compared with the Pt photocathode. Interestingly, the TiO2–Bi/BiOCl/75/2 h photocell showed the highest injection efficiency, indicating that Bi acting as a plasmonic photosensitizer facilitated the charge transfer at the electrode/electrolyte interface.
In order to explore the influence of BiOCl/75 and Bi/BiOCl/75/2 h on the photoexcited carrier transfer performance compared with Pt, photovoltage decay measurement was applied to investigate the existence of trap states in the semiconductor.51 As we all know, trap states are the worst imaginable regions as generation of photogenerated electron and hole recombination centers negatively affects the PEC performance of TiO2 photoanodes in the PEC system. Fig. 7c shows the photovoltage–time spectra decay rate of TiO2–Pt, TiO2–BiOCl/75 and TiO2–Bi/BiOCl/75/2 h photocells, and the decay lifetimes have been calculated by exponential with two time constants according to eqn (2) and (3):52 y(t) = A0 + A1e−t/τ1 + A2e−t/τ2(2) τm = (τ1 × τ2)/(τ1 + τ2)(3)where τm is the harmonic mean of the lifetime and the total half-life is log(2 × τm) (Fig. 7d). The total half-life was estimated to be 1.428, 1.437, and 1.436 seconds for TiO2–Pt, TiO2–BiOCl/75 and TiO2–Bi/BiOCl/75/2 h photocells, respectively. The total half-life values of three photocell systems show almost no change, suggesting that the replacement of Pt with BiOCl/75 and Bi/BiOCl/75/2 h photocathodes does not make the surface trap state cause any significant loss of charge via electron–hole recombination.
To gain insight into the electronic transfer mechanism between Bi nanoparticles and BiOCl nanosheets to offer a deeper understanding of the experimental results, we performed density functional theory calculations. The BiOCl (001) surface was applied with 11 atom layers and 4 × 4 supercells were constructed, taking into account both O and Cl terminations. For Bi nanoparticles, a sphere cluster with 32 atoms was modeled on the BiOCl (001) surface. The slabs were separated by a vacuum region of 15 Å to avoid the unwanted interaction between slabs and its periodic images. Adhesion energy calculations reveal that the O-terminated interface (Fig. 8a) has a little stronger adhesion than the Cl-terminated one (Fig. 8b) (0.86 J m−2 for the O termination vs. 0.69 J m−2 for the Cl termination), indicating the Bi cluster preferred deposition on the O-terminated surface than the Cl-terminated one. The charge density difference illustrates the charge redistributions mainly in the vicinity of the interface, and the charge obviously transfers from the Bi cluster to the BiOCl (001) surface, with either O or Cl termination.

The increased and decreased charge regions are indicated in yellow and cyan, respectively. The iso-surface value is 0.002 e Å−3. (c) Schematic representation of energy band and charge flow. 
According to the energy band and charge flow diagram (Fig. 8c), the Ef of the semiconductor photoelectrodes will shift under illumination, so the photovoltage will form by combining the voltage changes from both the photoanode and the photocathode. The photovoltage can significantly promote the photogenerated charge separation and benefit solar water splitting. Taking account of density functional theory calculations, Bi can gain an interface advantage from blending the composite structure with BiOCl, and the plasmon-induced interfacial charge-transfer transition (PICTT) from Bi nanoparticles would enable the decay of the plasmon by injecting the hot electron into the CB of BiOCl, which further facilitates the additional electron flow into the PEC system.53 Furthermore, the appearance of the photocurrent overlaid point based on the individual I–V curves from TiO2 and Bi/BiOCl photoelectrodes (Fig. S11†) also reveals that the TiO2–Bi/BiOCl system has the potential to realize PEC water splitting under no additional bias.54,55
The IPCE spectra were measured by using a solar simulator equipped with monochromatic incident light ranging from 300 to 600 nm (0 V vs. Ag/AgCl) to further investigate the wavelength-dependent PEC properties. The IPCE values were calculated using the following equation:56 IPCE (%) = {1240 (Vnm) × IpH (mA cm−2)}/{λ (nm) × Jlight (mW cm−2)} × 100(4)where λ is the wavelength of the incident light, IpH is the measured photocurrent density, and Jlight is the power intensity of the incident light at each wavelength. As shown in Fig. 9a, the maximum IPCE value of the TiO2/Pt photocell reached 17.6% at a wavelength of 385 nm and negligible IPCE values were observed in the range from 450 to 600 nm owing to its relatively broad bandgap energy, which is in quantitative agreement with the other previously reported TiO2-based photoanodes.57 It is noted that the TiO2–BiOCl/75 photocell exhibited larger IPCE values in the range from 300 to 450 nm than the corresponding TiO2–Pt photocell. This improvement of PEC activity for the TiO2–BiOCl/75 photocell can be ascribed to the enhanced light capturing ability and excellent carrier mobility. The IPCE value of the TiO2–Bi/BiOCl/75/2 h photocell was higher than those of the TiO2–Pt and TiO2–BiOCl/75 photocells, owing to the positive role of Bi nanoparticles in enhancing the PEC performance. Interestingly, the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the IPCE spectra for the TiO2–Pt, TiO2–BiOCl/75 and TiO2–Bi/BiOCl/75/2 h photocells was 51.7, 59.7 and 66.3 nm, respectively, which could be because Bi nanoparticles as a plasmonic photosensitizer extended the range of the photo-conversion wavelength.
 Fig. 9  IPCE spectra (a) and solar hydrogen evolution measurement (b) (100 mW cm−2). 
The photocell was designed for PEC water splitting, and a schematic diagram of the corresponding instrument is shown in Fig. S12.†58 The hydrogen production rate of the TiO2–Pt, TiO2–BiOCl/75 and TiO2–Bi/BiOCl/75/2 h photocells was measured and calculated at intervals of 1.5 h by gas chromatography. As shown in Fig. 9b, hydrogen production volume presents a linear relationship, and the photocurrent was maintained for 5 h without an obvious drop (Fig. S13†) owing to the good stability of Bi/BiOCl material, so the Bi/BiOCl photocathode can be used in long durability electrodes for solar PEC water splitting. Furthermore, the average hydrogen production rates of the TiO2–Pt and TiO2–Bi/BiOCl/75/2 h photocells are 1.2 µmol h−1 and 2.4 µmol h−1 by calculation, respectively. The improvement of the hydrogen generation performance mainly depended on the fabrication of the Bi/BiOCl/75/2 h photocathode material and efficient metal-to-semiconductor hot-electron transfer based upon the SPR effect.
3. Conclusions
In summary, a Bi/BiOCl heterostructure was obtained using BiOCl as the self-sacrificing template. The photocurrent densities of the optimal Bi/BiOCl photocathode can be up to 1.6 mA cm−2 (0.8 V vs. Ag/AgCl), which is almost 8 times that of the TiO2–Pt photocell. Moreover, the hydrogen evolution rate of the TiO2–Bi/BiOCl/75/2 h photocell was up to 2.4 µmol h−1 without additional bias, which was much higher than the traditional TiO2–Pt photocell. The reason for this is that the presence of metallic Bi nanoparticles with noble metal-like behavior not only drastically enhances the photoresponsive capability but also facilitates the separation and transport of charge carriers upon cooperative contribution of SPR effects. Therefore, this work may open a new avenue for designing photocathodes with non-noble metals as the co-catalyst to realize solar water splitting.
4. Experimental section
4.1 Chemicals and reagents
Tetrabutyl titanate (C16H36O4Ti, ≥98.0%), hydrochloric acid (HCl, 36.33%), bismuth(III) nitrate pentahydrate (Bi(NO3)3·5H2O, ≥99.0%) and potassium chloride (KCl, ≥99.5%) were all purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co, Ltd. Other materials, such as absolute alcohol and acetic acid, were obtained from Aladdin Reagent Co. Deionized water was used in all experiments.
4.2 Synthesis of TiO2 nanorod array photoanodes
The TiO2 nanorod array photoanodes were synthesized on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass substrate by hydrothermal method.59 Typically, tetrabutyl titanate was slowly dropped in the mixed solution (15 mL of hydrochloric acid and 15 mL of deionized water) under strong stirring until the solution became clear. Then FTO substrate with the conducting side facing down was placed at an angle against the wall of the Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave (25 mL). After that, the obtained solution was also added into a Teflon autoclave and heated at 180 °C for 6 h. After being cooled to room temperature, the resulting TiO2 nanorod arrays were washed with deionized water several times. The TiO2 nanorod arrays were immersed in another mixed solution of acetic acid (2 mL), tetrabutyl titanate (1.5 mL) and absolute alcohol (100 mL) for 1 h. Subsequently, the as-prepared TiO2 nanorod arrays were transferred into a muffle furnace and annealed in air at 450 °C for 2 h.
4.3 Synthesis of ultrathin BiOCl nanosheets
The BiOCl nanosheets were obtained by chemical bath deposition (CBD) method. Four beakers containing 50 mL of deionized water were prepared. Then, the Bi(NO3)3·5H2O (0.115 g) and KCl (0.018 g) were added to the first and third beakers, and the mixtures were ultrasonicated for 5 min to ensure that all chemicals were dissolved. The FTO substrate was immersed into the above four solutions for approximately 5 seconds in beakers one to four, then the process was repeated and completion of immersing the above four solutions was recorded as a cycle. The cycle times are 25, 50, 75, and 100, the resulting samples were labeled as BiOCl/25, BiOCl/50, BiOCl/75, and BiOCl/100, respectively. Finally, the as-synthesized samples were dried at a temperature of 60 °C for 0.5 h in the air.
4.4 Synthesis of Bi/BiOCl nanosheet photocathode
The Bi/BiOCl was synthesized by in situ photoelectroreduction method in 0.5 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution. The photoelectroreduction was performed at 0.6 V in a three electrode standard system with TiO2 nanorods as the working electrode, BiOCl/n (n = 25, 50, 75 and 100) as the counter electrode and Ag/AgCl as a reference electrode for 5 hours; the resulting samples were labeled as Bi/BiOCl/n/5 (n = 25, 50, 75 and 100). Similarly, Bi/BiOCl/75/0.5, Bi/BiOCl/75/1, Bi/BiOCl/75/2 and Bi/BiOCl/75/8 were obtained by altering the photoelectroreduction time to 0.5, 1, 2 and 8 hours, respectively. All samples were rinsed with distilled water to remove Na2SO4. Finally, the samples were dried under vacuum at a temperature of 60 °C for 0.5 h in the air.
4.5 Computational methods
The calculations were performed using the projector augmented wave (PAW) method,60 as implemented within the Vienna ab initio Simulation Package (VASP).61,62 The generalized gradient approximation (GGA) within the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof scheme63 was employed to describe the exchange-correlation functional. The single-particle Kohn–Sham wave function was expanded using plane waves with a cutoff energy of 400 eV. The Monkhorst–Pack k-mesh was set to be 1 × 1 × 1 in the irreducible Brillion zone. The tetrahedron method with Blöchl correction was adopted for the self-consistent calculation. The atomic structures were fully relaxed until the total energy was converged to less than 1.0 × 10−4 eV and the magnitude of force on each atom fell below 0.05 eV Å−1. The adhesion energy (Wad) is defined as:Wad = (EBi-cluster + EBiOCl-slab − Etot)/Awhere EBi-cluster, EBiOCl-slab and Etot are the energy of the isolated Bi cluster, BiOCl slab and their interface, respectively, and A is the surface area. The charge density difference (Δρ) is expressed as follows:Δρ = ρtot − ρBi-cluster − ρBiOCl-slabwhere ρBi-cluster, ρBiOCl-slab and ρtot are the charge density of the isolated Bi cluster, BiOCl slab and their interface, respectively.
4.6 Electrochemical and photoelectrochemical measurements
The photocurrent density was determined with a three-electrode cell system by using the TiO2 nanorods as the working electrodes, Bi/BiOCl nanosheets as the photocathode and Ag/AgCl (saturated KCl) as the reference electrode in 0.5 M Na2SO4 electrolyte solution under simulated sunlight with a 300 W xenon lamp. Linear sweeps of these electrodes were done with a scanning speed of bias potential ranging from −0.5 V to 0.8 V, and the illumination area is in the range of 1 cm2 under 50 or 100 mW cm−2 radiation intensity. Charge injection efficiency is estimated by measuring the photocurrent density in 0.5 M Na2SO4 solution with/without H2O2 (H2O2 volume concentration is 0.1%). Photovoltage–time spectra were collected using a CHI 852C electrochemical station with a solar simulator. The IPCE values at specific wavelengths were calculated at 300 and 600 nm at a potential of 0 V vs. Ag/AgCl by using a solar simulator (Newport 69920, 300 W xenon lamp) equipped with a monochromator, and photocurrents were measured for each wavelength for at least 30 s. The PEC water splitting experiments were monitored using the three-electrode system at 0 V vs. Ag/AgCl; the TiO2 photoanode (1 cm2, work electrode) was immersed in 20% methanol aqueous solution, and the Pt plate, BiOCl/75 and Bi/BiOCl/75/2 h photocathodes were in deionized water. A solar simulator with a light intensity of 100 mW cm−2 was used as the light source. Hydrogen generated from the Pt plate or Bi/BiOCl nanosheets photocathode was measured using gas chromatography.
4.7 Characterization
The morphology of the as-synthesized samples was characterized using a scanning electron microscope (SEM, Hitachi S-4800 25.0 kV 7.5 mm × 40.0 SE(U)) equipped with an energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDX). The surface structure of the obtained products was analyzed with a transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEM-2100). High resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) was carried out on a Hitachi HF-3300 electron microscope. The powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the as-synthesized samples were analyzed using a Bruker D8 ADVANCE X-ray diffractometer. The UV-vis diffuse reflection spectra (DRS) of the samples were recorded using a UV2550 (Shimadzu, Japan) with 100% BaSO4 as the reflectance standard. A Bruker EPR A 300-10/12 spectrometer was used to investigate the electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) of the as-prepared samples. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS VG, Physical Electrons Quantum 2000 Scanning Esca Microprob, Al Kα radiation) measurements were used to measure the surface chemical compositions and states. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (ESI) data were collected with an electrochemical workstation (CH Instruments, CHI-760). The photochemical and photoelectrochemical properties and other parameters measurements were obtained using another electrochemical workstation (CH Instruments, CHI-852C). Incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was measured by an external quantum efficiency measurement system (Newport/Oriel, QE-PV-SI) connected to the electrochemical workstation.
