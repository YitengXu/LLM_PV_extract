    , Accepted 20th December 2017First published on 21st December 2017AbstractPb-free halide double perovskites, A2B+B3+X6 (A = Cs, B+/B3+ = metal cation, and X = halogen anion), have been proposed to replace hybrid halide perovskites (e.g., CH3NH3PbI3) as stable Pb-free materials for high efficiency solar cell absorbers. Here, using first-principles density functional theory calculations and symmetry analysis we show that the overall electronic properties of A2B+B3+X6 depend strongly on the atomic orbitals and site occupation of the B+ and B3+ cations. For ordered A2B+B3+X6 compounds, in order to have a direct band gap with allowed optical transitions, both of the B+ and B3+ cations should possess the lone-pair s state. Thus, only the A2BIIIA+BVA3+X6 family of compounds satisfies this criterion. On the other hand, we reveal that the electronic structures of A2B+B3+X6 can be greatly tuned by controlling the site occupation ordering parameter of the B+ and B3+ cations. Compared to their ordered counterparts, the band gaps of disordered A2B+B3+X6 alloys can be reduced significantly and the band gap character can be switched from indirect to direct, which greatly expanded the possible candidates for solar cell applications. Our results thus set a new direction and guidelines for the design of Pb-free halide double perovskites for solar cells.
1. Introduction
The past five years have witnessed an explosive development of a new class of solar cells based on hybrid organic–inorganic halide perovskites with the general formula ABX3, where A is a relatively large inorganic or organic cation, such as Cs+ and CH3NH3+ (MA+), B is a metal cation (typically Pb2+), and X is a halogen anion (e.g., Cl−, Br− and I−), which show dramatically boosted power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) from an initial value of 3.8% to currently over 22%.1–4 Although these halide perovskites possess several key advantages, such as ease of fabrication, strong solar absorption and low non-radiative carrier recombination rates, that make them ideal candidates for photovoltaic applications, challenges, such as structural instability and the presence of toxic element Pb, are still standing in their way to large-scale commercialization.5–8 Whereas the stability issue of these halide perovskites can be addressed through multi-cation substitution, carbon encapsulation, and incorporation of hydrophobic moieties, the solution of the toxicity issue relies essentially on the replacement of Pb with non-toxic elements.
To replace Pb, the most obvious route is via the substitution of other isovalent group-IVA elements, such as Sn and Ge; however, both Sn2+ and Ge2+ are relatively unstable and tend to be oxidized to their tetravalent states, leading to rapid degradation of corresponding halide perovskites.9,10 Substituting Pb with other divalent elements out of the group-IVA family has also been investigated by recent computational studies, where the resulting compounds inevitably show poor optoelectronic performances, due to the increased band gaps, poor optical absorption, and large carrier effective masses.11,12 Thus, it seems unlikely that Pb can be successfully eliminated in halide perovskites through simple isovalent substitution.
On the other hand, the heterovalent substitution of Pb2+ by the transmutation of 2Pb2+ into a pair of B+/B3+ cations, which leads to the formation of “halide double perovskites” with the general formula A2B+B3+X6, has become a popular approach and been extensively studied in the last few years.13,25 It is hoped that the large number of possible combinations of B+/B3+ cations in A2B+B3+X6 can provide opportunities to find promising alternatives to Pb halide perovskites. So far, several candidates have been proposed, both experimentally and theoretically, which include Cs2Sn□I6,13–16 Cs2AgBiX6 (X = Br, Cl),17–20 Cs2InAgCl6,21 Cs2InSbCl6 (Cs2InBiCl6),24 Rb2CuInCl6 (Rb2AgInBr6),25etc. Although these ordered halide double perovskites have shown several attractive merits, such as good stability or suitable band gaps, none of these ordered compounds have ideal band structures. For instance, Cs2AgBiX6 compounds have been reported to have good stability against air and temperature, but these compounds possess indirect band gaps, an obvious disadvantage for thin-film photovoltaic applications.17–20 On the other hand, Cs2InSbCl6 and Cs2InBiCl6 have been proposed to possess suitable direct band gaps,24 however, they suffer from the stability issue, due to the oxidation tendency of In+ to In3+.23 While Cs2Sn□I6, Cs2AgInCl6, and Rb2CuInCl6 can have both direct band gaps and good stability,13–21,25 the dipole transitions between the band edge states in these compounds are parity-forbidden, which leads to relatively large optical band gaps.21–22
Despite the enormous efforts, the current search for stable Pb-free halide perovskites for solar cell applications is hindered by the lack of a general theoretical understanding and guidelines about what kind of mixed B-site cation perovskites can have combined good stability and superior optoelectronic properties. Although some recent progress has been made in the general trend of the stability issue,26 it is still not clear what kind of B+/B3+ combination and atomic configuration can have direct band gaps with allowed band edge transitions. These guidelines are urgently needed for the future development of stable Pb-free halide perovskite solar cells.
To overcome this bottleneck, a systematic study and comprehensive understanding of the electronic structures of halide double perovskites as a function of B+/B3+ cation combinations and configurations are needed. We want to point out that most of the recent studies focus solely on ordered halide double perovskites with a face-centered cubic (fcc) structure in which the B site forms a NaCl-like structure, whereas less attention has been paid to disordered systems. In fact, it has been extensively demonstrated for conventional semiconductor alloys that the electronic properties of disordered alloys may significantly deviate from their ordered counterparts,27–30 which suggests that the optoelectronic properties of mixed B-site halide perovskite alloys could be tuned by controlling the configuration of B+/B3+ cations.
In this work, we perform DFT calculations and symmetry analysis to systematically study the effect of B+/B3+ cation substitution and configuration on the electronic structures of halide double perovskites. Our results demonstrate that among all the ordered halide double perovskites with a NaCl-like structure, only the A2BIIIA+BVA3+X6 family can have promising optoelectronic properties, whereas all the other families are not ideal for photovoltaic applications, because they possess either indirect band gaps or parity-forbidden transitions between the band edges. On the other hand, we find that the optoelectronic properties of halide double perovskites can be improved, as we change from the ordered to disordered compounds, by disordering the B+/B3+ cations in their sublattice. Compared to their ordered counterparts, two primary benefits can be obtained in disordered halide double perovskites, i.e., the band gaps of the compounds can be greatly reduced and at the same time the band gap character can be tuned from indirect to direct. The specific nature of these findings thus points out a new and exciting path towards creating novel Pb-free halide double perovskites for photovoltaic applications.
2. Computational methods
The first-principles calculations are carried out by using the projector augmented wave (PAW) method31 within the density functional theory as implemented in the VASP package.32 The exchange–correlation energy is treated within the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) parameterized by Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof for solids (PBEsol).33 The wave functions are expanded by using the plane waves up to a kinetic energy cutoff of 500 eV. Brillouin-zone integrations are approximated by using special k-point sampling of the Monkhorst–Pack scheme34 with a k-point mesh resolution of 2π × 0.03/Å−1. The cell lattice vectors and atomic coordinates are fully relaxed until the force on each atom is less than 0.01 eV Å−1. The band symmetry and parity analyses are carried out with the QUANTUM ESPRESSO package35 based on GBRV PBE scalar relativistic potentials.36
3. Results and discussion
3.1 The effect of B+/B3+ cation substitution on the electronic structures of halide double perovskites
From the halide perovskite to double perovskite, with the increased unit cell, each B2+ cation in AB2+X3 is substituted by one pair of B+/B3+ cations in A2B+B3+X6, as illustrated in Fig. 1. In terms of their valence atomic orbitals, the possible substituting B+/B3+ cations can be classified into three classes: (i) those have the semi-core d states, (ii) those have the lone-pair s state, and (iii) those do not have the d or s states. The combinations of these B+/B3+ cations then lead to six distinct families of halide double perovskites, as shown in Fig. 1. Here, we select Cs2NaInCl6, Cs2AgInCl6, Cs2In+In3+Cl6, Cs2NaBiCl6, Cs2AgBiCl6 and Cs2InBiCl6 as the representative compounds of these six families of halide double perovskites, with their band characters summarized in Table 1.

Before discussing the various B+/B3+ cation substitutions in halide double perovskites, we start with examining the band folding relationship as the structure changes from the perovskite to double perovskite. Fig. 2(a) and (b) show the calculated band structures of a typical halide perovskite CsMgCl3 and its double perovskite counterpart Cs2Mg2Cl6. Since both of the perovskite and double perovskite structures possess the inversion symmetry, which may induce parity-forbidden transitions between the valence and conduction band edges, the symmetry characters of the bands near the band gap are also given. For CsMgCl3, as shown in Fig. 2(a), the valence band maximum (VBM) consists mainly of the Cl 3p orbitals and is located at the R point, while the conduction band minimum (CBM) consists mainly of the Mg 3s orbital and is located at the Γ point, leading to an indirect band gap. The symmetry analysis indicates that both the VBM and CBM have an even parity, whereas the top valence band at the Γ point has an odd parity. When the unit cell is doubled from the perovskite to double perovskite, the BZ is reduced to half and the R points in the perovskite structure fold into the Γ point in the double perovskite structure, as in the case of Cs2Mg2Cl6, and thus the VBM shifts to the Γ point, resulting in a seemingly direct band gap, as shown in Fig. 2(b). However, it should be remembered that this direct band gap is formed by artificial band folding, due to the doubled unit cell, and therefore transitions between the VBM and CBM could not really occur. Thus, we can refer to this kind of band gap as the pseudo direct band gap. Moreover, as the VBM and CBM are now located at the same k point, the band edge transitions in Cs2Mg2Cl6 become parity-forbidden. From these results, we can conclude that from the perovskite to double perovskite, band folding changes the indirect band gap to pseudo direct band gap and parity-allowed transitions to parity-forbidden transitions between the band edges.

The s, p, and d orbital components of the bands are represented as red (light blue), green (dark blue), and pink spheres, respectively. All of the bands are aligned with respect to the Cs 1s core level. The dashed lines are at the middle of the band gaps. 
With this picture in mind, we next discuss the six typical B+/B3+ cation substitutions in halide double perovskites step by step. Fig. 2(c) shows the calculated band structure of Cs2NaInCl6, a representative compound of the A2BIA+BIIIA3+X6 family. As shown in Fig. 2(c), the VBM and CBM of Cs2NaInCl6 derive mainly from the Cl 3p and In 5s orbitals, respectively, and both are located at the Γ point, resulting in a direct band gap. It should be noted that, as the cell symmetry is reduced by cation transmutation, the direct band gap of Cs2NaInCl6 is authentic, different from the pseudo direct band gap in Cs2Mg2Cl3. Thus, one may hope that transitions between band edges could occur, provided that the VBM and CBM have different parities. However, the calculated results indicate an even parity for both the VBM and CBM states, similar to Cs2Mg2Cl6. This indicates that simple atomic transmutation in Cs2NaInCl6 is not able to break parity-forbidden transitions, as shown in Fig. 2(c). These results reveal that parity-forbidden transitions should be an intrinsic feature of ordered halide double perovskites when both the B+ and B3+ atoms have mainly the s and p valence characters.
By replacing Na+ with Ag+, we can introduce semi-core d states into Cs2AgInCl6, a typical member of the A2BIB+BIIIA3+X6 family. As shown in Fig. 4(d), a strong p–d coupling between the Ag 4d and Cl 3p orbitals can be observed in Cs2AgInCl6, which significantly modifies the bands near the band gap. As a result, the VBM of Cs2AgInCl6 is constructed by the hybridization between the Ag 4d and Cl 3p orbitals, while the CBM is formed by the mixture of Ag 5s, In 5s and Cl 3p orbitals. Both the VBM and CBM are located at the Γ point, providing a direct band gap. Compared to Cs2NaInCl6, the band gap of Cs2AgInCl6 is significantly reduced, which can be ascribed to two synergistic effects, i.e., the p–d repulsion between the occupied Ag 4d and Cl 3p orbitals promotes the VBM to a higher energy and at the same time the lower Ag 5s orbital, compared to the Na 4s orbital, and pushes the CBM to a lower energy. The reduced band gap is beneficial to solar absorption in Cs2AgInCl6; however, the issue of parity-forbidden transitions between band edges is still not resolved. As indicated in Fig. 4(d), both the VBM and CBM of Cs2AgInCl6 possess an even parity. For the CBM, this can be ascribed to the predominant s character originating from the perovskite Γ point, as discussed above. While for the VBM, this is caused by the fact that the VBM state still originates from the folded perovskite states at the R point (R3+): the Ag 4d orbitals split into the t2g (5+) and eg (3+) states due to the octahedral crystal field, and the eg (3+) states at the perovskite R point can interact with the Cl 3p orbitals with the same parity (R3+), but the Ag 4d orbitals at the perovskite Γ point with an even parity do not couple with the Cl 3p orbitals with an odd parity, as shown in Fig. 2(a) and (d). Thus, the VBM stemming from the p–d repulsion can only have the Γ3+ symmetry. As a consequence, the introduction of semi-core d states enhances parity-forbidden transitions in the corresponding halide double perovskites, which is consistent with the experimental observations that Cs2AgInCl6 exhibits a much larger optical band gap than the fundamental band gap.21
For the A2BIIIA+BIIIA3+X6 and A2BIA+BVA3+X6 families, the lone-pair s state can be introduced at the B+ and B3+ sites, respectively, as exemplified by Cs2In+In3+Cl6 and Cs2NaBiCl6. For Cs2In+In3+Cl6, as shown in Fig. 2(e), the In+ 5s band is pulled down, becomes the top of the valence band, and the bottom of the conduction band derives mainly from the In3+ 5s orbital. As a result, the VBM and CBM shift to the W and L points, respectively, leading to an indirect band gap. For Cs2NaBiCl6, because the Bi 6s orbital is much lower in energy than the In+ 5s orbital, the lone pair s state is now deep inside the valence band, so the VBM consists mainly of the Cl 3p orbitals and is still located at the W point because the s–p coupling at the Γ(R) point is not large enough, while the CBM consists mainly of Bi 6p and some Na 4s orbitals and is located at the L point, because the s–p repulsion between the Na 4s and Bi 6p orbitals pushes the CBM state at the L point to a low energy. So, it also results in an indirect band gap, as shown in Fig. 2(g). Obviously, the indirect band gaps make these compounds undesirable for thin film photovoltaic applications.

Fig. 2(g) shows the calculated band structure of Cs2AgBiCl6, a representative compound of the A2BIB+BVA3+X6 family. Compared to Cs2NaBiCl6, a strong p–d coupling between the Ag 5d and Cl 3p orbitals can also be observed in Cs2AgBiCl6, as a consequence, the VBM of Cs2AgBiCl6 derives mainly from the hybridization between the Ag 5d and Cl 3p orbitals and is shifted to the X point. Because the Ag 5s orbital energy is lower than the Na 4s orbital energy, the s–p coupling at the L point is stronger, which further lowers the CBM energy of Cs2AgBiCl6. Consequently, Cs2AgBiCl6 also possesses an indirect band gap.
Finally, for the A2BIIIA+BVA3+X6 family, e.g. Cs2InBiCl6, both of the B+ and B3+ cations have the lone-pair s state. As shown in Fig. 2(g), for Cs2InBiCl6, the VBM is derived primarily from the In 5s and Cl 3p orbitals due to the strong s–p coupling, while the CBM is derived primarily from the Bi 6p orbitals due to the lack of s–p coupling. Both the VBM and CBM are located at the Γ point (folded from the perovskite R point), creating a direct band gap. Moreover, the strong s–p coupling between the In 5s and Cl 3p orbitals promotes the VBM to a relatively high energy with respect to the CBM and thus leads to a small band gap. The VBM exhibits a predominant s character and possesses an even parity, whereas the CBM exhibits a predominant p character and possesses an odd parity. Therefore, the band edge transitions at the Γ point in Cs2InBiCl6 are parity allowed. Therefore, in terms of the electronic structures, Cs2InBiCl6 could be a promising candidate to replace Pb halide perovskites.
To summarize, the above examples clearly show that to obtain a suitable direct band gap with parity-allowed band edge transitions, both the B+/B3+ cations in A2B+B3+X6 must possess the lone-pair s state, so that a strong s–p coupling between the lone-pair s and X p orbitals could occur in the valence band and no strong s–p coupling exists in the conduction band. To satisfy this criterion, the B+ cation must be selected from the IIIA-group elements, such as Ga, In and Tl, and the B3+ cation must be selected from the VA-group elements, such as Sb and Bi, which corresponds to the family of A2BIIIA+BVA3+X6 compounds. However, the challenge for these compounds is how to make their structures stable, as BIIIA+ is readily oxidized to BIIIA3+, which creates a driving force for the compound decomposition.23 Recent experimental studies have reported that the stability of Cs2InBiBr6 can be improved by mixing the A-site with large organic molecules, such as CH3NH3 and CH(NH2)2, which points out a possible direction for the further development of A2BIIIA+BVA3+X6 compounds.37
3.2 The effect of B+/B3+ cation distribution on the electronic structures of halide double perovskites
Beside trying to improve the stability of A2BIIIA+BVA3+X6 compounds, an alternative way for the future design of halide perovskites for photovoltaic applications is to improve the optoelectronic properties of halide double perovskites that are intrinsically stable. For instance, several members in the A2BIA+BVA3+X6 and A2BIB+BVA3+X6 families, such as Cs2NaBiCl6 and Cs2AgBiCl6, have been demonstrated to be thermodynamically stable,18 but they all possess indirect and large band gaps, which makes them undesirable for thin film photovoltaic applications. Thus, if we can tune the indirect band gaps of these compounds to be direct and meanwhile reduce their band gaps, they could become promising candidates to replace Pb halide perovskites. The question is how can we do that? As is well known for conventional semiconductor alloys, the electronic properties of the alloys may significantly depend on the degree of ordering in these alloys, especially for non-isovalent systems.27–30 Accordingly, we expect that the electronic structures of these mixed B-site alloys can be tuned by altering the B+/B3+ cation distributions.
To verify this expectation, as an example, we calculate the band structures of Cs2NaSbCl6 with different Na+/Sb3+ cation distributions, as shown in Fig. 3(a). A cubic supercell with 40 atoms is employed to consider six different Na+/Sb3+ cation distributions, as depicted in Fig. 3(b). The configuration 6 (C6) corresponds to the ordered double perovskite Cs2NaSbCl6 compound with only nearest neighbor Na–Sb bonds in the B sublattice, while all the other configurations correspond to the disordered Cs2NaSbCl6 compounds with some Sb–Sb bonds. As indicated in Fig. 3(a), among all these configurations, only C6 shows an indirect band gap, while all the others show direct band gaps. Moreover, compared to C6, the band gaps of all the other configurations are significantly reduced. As summarized in Fig. 3(b), from C6 to C1, the band gap decreases monotonously, as more Sb3+ cations are neighbored to each other. Detailed inspection of the partial charge density at the band edges indicates that for all these Cs2NaSbCl6 compounds, the VBM derives mainly from the s–p coupling between the Sb 5s and Cl 3p orbitals, while the CBM derives mainly from Sb 5p orbitals, as shown in Fig. 4. As more Sb3+ cations are neighbored in the disordered compounds, the interaction between the neighboring Sb 5p orbitals is enhanced, which broadens the conduction band and moves the CBM to a lower energy. Meanwhile, as more ⋯Sb–Cl–Sb⋯ chains appear in the disordered compounds, the s–p coupling between the Sb 5s and Cl 3p orbitals becomes symmetric and stronger, promoting the VBM to a higher energy. The opposite shift of the VBM and CBM therefore results in gradually reduced band gaps from C6 to C1. Fig. 3(c) shows the calculated light absorption coefficients for all these Cs2NaSbCl6 compounds. Compared to their ordered counterparts, the light absorption coefficients of the disordered compounds are improved as their onset absorption moves towards much lower energies, consistent with the calculated band structures. These results clearly suggest that by changing from the ordered to disordered compounds, the optoelectronic properties of Cs2NaSbCl6 can be greatly improved, in good agreement with our expectations.

Despite the improved optoelectronic properties, these disordered Cs2NaSbCl6 compounds have higher energies than the ground-state ordered double perovskite due to the enhanced coulombic interaction between the neighboring Sb3+ cations. As shown in Fig. 3(b), the energy differences between the ordered and disordered compounds are in the range from 30 to 65 meV per atom for the six studied configurations, and show a trend opposite to the band gap variation, that is as the band gap gets smaller, the compound becomes less stable. A similar trend can be generally found in most semiconductors, as the large band gap usually means strong chemical bonds between the cations and anions. Notably, an obvious reduction of the band gap occurs from C6 to C5, whereas the energy difference between these two configurations is only ca. 33 meV per atom. The small energy difference suggests that it is possible to stabilize disordered alloys in experiments by raising the synthesis temperature or through doping.
4. Conclusions
In conclusion, based on the DFT calculations and symmetry analysis, we have systematically studied the effect of B+/B3+ cation substitution and configuration on the electronic structures of halide double perovskites, A2B+B3+X6. Our results indicate that the overall electronic properties of A2B+B3+X6 depend strongly on the atomic orbitals and configurations of the B+/B3+ cations. To obtain direct band gaps and allowed optical transitions, both of the B+/B3+ cations in A2B+B3+X6 should either possess the lone-pair s state, so that a strong s–p coupling between the lone-pair s and X p orbitals could occur, or form a disordered alloy at the B+/B3+ cation sites. Compared to their ordered counterparts, the band gap of the disordered alloy is reduced and can be tuned continuously by controlling the ordering parameter. Moreover, the nature of the band gap can change from indirect to more direct, which together makes them strong candidates for solar cell applications.
