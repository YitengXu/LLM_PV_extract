Introduction
Two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials (i.e. nanosheets, NS) have gained a lot of interest in light of their exceptional photophysical properties and their potential for many applications. The first established and up to now mostly investigated 2D material is graphene.1–7 Since its isolation in 2004 by Geim and Novoselov, several theoretical and experimental studies have followed, which have underlined this material's interesting optoelectronic properties.1–4,6–10 Following graphene, several new classes of 2D materials have been discovered and studied in detail. Above all, a versatile chemistry and novel properties could be unraveled by transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs),1,5,71 whose (single) layers displaying high surface area have allowed applications in several fields, including catalysis, energy storage, sensing and electronics.5,7–9,11–15 Next to the TMDs, numerous other classes of promising 2D materials have been established.7,10 With regards to the biomedical field, successful applications and high promises for e.g. drug and gene delivery, biosensing, tissue engineering, imaging and photothermal therapy (PTT) have been reported especially for graphene, graphene oxide (GO), reduced graphene oxide (rGO), silicate clays, layered double hydroxides (LDHs), TMDs, transition metal oxides (TMOs), graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4), hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), transition metal carbides and carbonitrides (MXenes), 2D monoelemental materials (Xenes) and metal–organic frameworks (MOFs).16–18 In terms of NS preparation, bottom-up synthetic techniques (e.g. chemical vapor deposition (CVD), epitaxial growth and wet chemical methods12,19) can produce high quality crystals with the drawback, however, of higher costs and more demanding experimental conditions.9,10 Among the top-down methods, more scalable techniques include wet ball milling and high-pressure homogenization for which high shear processing is employed.10,20 Scalability is a clear advantage also shared by liquid-phase exfoliation (LPE).8–10 Furthermore, this technique allows size control and subsequent chemical modification of the exfoliated nanosheets (fundamental for e.g. drug delivery and sensing applications), as well as solution-based processing (e.g. inkjet printing and spray coating). For these reasons, LPE of layered nanomaterials holds high interest for applications, including multifunctional composites, electronics, biomedicine, energy generation and storage.8,9
It is well known that fluorescence imaging in the near-infrared (NIR, typically defined in the wavelength region of ≈750–1700 nm) allows higher tissue penetration and contrast due to the reduction of scattering, absorption and autofluorescence displayed by biological samples within this window.21–24 NIR-emitting organic dyes such as cyanines25,26 (e.g. indocyanine green, ICG27) and modified boron dipyrromethenes (BODIPYs28–31) have been successfully employed as fluorophores of versatile chemistry for numerous studies. Additionally, NIR-fluorescent nanomaterials characterized by higher photostability have been also reported. Among them, single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs32–43) have been used to detect small signaling molecules, proteins and lipids. They can be chemically tailored and allow spatiotemporal imaging of analytes such as neurotransmitters or identification of bacteria. In general, however, the amount of available fluorophores that emit fluorescence in the NIR is low, and most of them are affected by low QY, low photostability and/or biocompatibility issues.23,27,44–48 For this reason, the scientific interest towards the preparation of novel NIR dyes and nanomaterials for biological imaging is very high.
The silicates Egyptian Blue (CaCuSi4O10, EB), Han Blue (BaCuSi4O10, HB) and Han Purple (BaCuSi2O6, HP) embrace a fascinating historical background and exciting photophysical and chemical properties. EB is regarded as the most ancient artificial pigment made by man. With its origins dated back to Ancient Egypt (≈2500 BC), this phyllosilicate has been extensively employed throughout history in decoration of artworks (e.g. the well-known Bust of Queen Nefertiti).49–53 HB and HP, on the other side, were mostly employed in the times of the Qin and Han dynasties (≈220 BC–220 AD), as witnessed by e.g. the Terracotta Warriors of the tomb of Emperor Qin Shihuangdi in Xi'an.54 The manufacturing of these pigments shares common traits,49,55,56 historically focused on salt-flux methods. These typically require long reaction times, yet they yield large crystals at not excessive reaction temperatures.49,57 Alternatively, flux-less solid-state synthesis is usually less time-consuming and can lead to lower amounts of glassy matrix surrounding the crystals, however they require higher temperatures and tend to produce smaller crystallites.52,57–63 Synthesis in molten carbonates has proven so far inefficient, resulting in the production of e.g. azurite and malachite.64 In search of a better control over morphology and size while working more “green” (i.e. at relatively mild temperatures and pressures), hydrothermal processes have been successfully established.65–68 Additionally, also sol–gel methods,69 solution combustion synthesis (SCS)70 and pseudomorphosis routes from a synthetic layered sodium silicate71 have been reported.
Thanks to their layered crystal structure, these silicates can be easily exfoliated into 2D nanomaterials (NS). Most interestingly, EB-NS, HB-NS and HP-NS seem to retain most of their bulk features after down-scaling: a robust (photo)chemical stability, a bright NIR emission, a broad visible (Vis)-NIR absorption range and a high biocompatibility are just some of their most appealing characteristics. In recent years, a growing number of studies has been devoted to the collection of novel insights on the optoelectronic properties of these nanomaterials. Furthermore, the typically high aspect ratio of 2D nanomaterials, next to the previously mentioned features of EB, HB and HP, have raised interest for these silicates among researchers of diverse scientific backgrounds. Apparently unrelated modern technological fields such as smart inking, latent fingermark detection, batteries, multifunctional biocomposites, biological sensors and labeling agents are making use of EB-NS, HB-NS and HP-NS (Fig. 1).

Crystallography and exfoliation routes
The blue-purple pigments EB, HB and HP (Fig. 2a) are layered homologue silicates with similar crystal structure. EB's natural analogue is the mineral cuprorivaite, whose tetragonal crystal structure (spacegroup P4/ncc), first determined by Pabst et al. in 1959, consists of parallel layers of silicate weakly held together by the presence of interlayer calcium ions in an eight-fold coordination geometry (Fig. 2b).49,61,81,82 The copper ions, tightly shielded within the silicate framework, are arranged in a square planar coordination geometry (D4h). Except for the substitution of the Ca2+ ions with Ba2+ ones, HB (whose natural analogue is the mineral effenbergerite) displays the same structure.61,82,83 The tetragonal crystal structure of HP (for which suggested space groups at room temperature include Im268,84,85 and I41/acd66,86) is, instead, less rich in silica and presents a chemically labile Cu–Cu bond. The weaker stability especially towards weak acids shown by HP (whose natural mineral analogue is colinowensite) is likely due to this characteristic metal–metal bond.55,56,68,85,87,88 For EB, HB and HP alike, the weaker out-of-plane bonds enable exfoliation of these lamellar structures into NS. Up to now, the main techniques employed for this task have included prolonged hot stirring (Fig. 2c(i)), probe ultrasonication (Fig. 2c(ii)), bath sonication (Fig. 2c(iii)) and ball milling (Fig. 2c(iv)). Despite applying in some cases high local mechanical (shear) stress, the exfoliation routes reported so far seem not to have significantly affected the crystallinity of the samples, thus retaining the materials’ identity and properties (as shown, for example, for the hot stirring method in Fig. 2d).

Although multiple synthetic routes for EB, HB and HP have been reported (Tables 1–3), several studies rely on commercially available bulk powders as starting material. These are produced following the salt-flux method and they typically appear in the form of several μm-large platelets. On their surfaces, the characteristic steps, ridges and terraces of such lamellar materials can be easily observed (Fig. 3a). A first robust example of exfoliation of so-synthesized EB was demonstrated by Johnson-McDaniel et al. Via simple stirring in hot water over several days, EB-NS could be produced. This prolonged hot stirring, followed by a shorter bath sonication step in an organic solvent, led to μm-sized sheets down to ≈1 nm in thickness, i.e. monolayer regime57,89 (Fig. 3b and c). Shortly after this seminal study, Salguero et al. applied a similar protocol to produce EB-NS with lateral size ranging from hundreds of nm to several μm. While exfoliation of high aspect ratio EB-NS proved to be quite straightforward, the same did not apply to HB. Indeed, proper exfoliation of this material required probe ultrasonication and bath sonication in organic solvents.57,90 When dealing with minerals such as silicates, a common way to reduce crystal size is milling. Borisov et al. published the first employment of ball milling on EB.91 While the dimensions of such crushed crystallites could enable the desired material applications, the lateral sizes obtained with this technique once again lied in the μm rather than in the nm range. The previously mentioned pivotal works inspired a series of follow-up studies which featured size reduction of EB and HB (Tables 1 and 2). While most of these publications mainly presented NS in a similar (μm) size range, the one from Shahbazi et al. stood out due to the higher degree of monodispersity and higher amount of small (<200 nm) EB-NS (Fig. 3d): their approach consisted in a modified version of the Johnson-McDaniel protocol with the additional employment of a cationic lipophilic surfactant (cetrimonium bromide, CTAB).92 High energy exfoliation can quite simply yield NS structures down to few tenths in nm in lateral size that, despite the irregular morphologies typical of fragmentation, still display a homogeneous elemental distribution (Fig. 3e–h).77 Further progress in the direction of smaller sizes and more thorough statistics was later reported by Selvaggio et al., who established a hybrid protocol consisting of wet ball milling and tip sonication. With this approach, also HP-NS in the nm range and with just a few layers of thickness were obtained and fully characterized for the first time (Fig. 3i, j and Table 3).72,74

Fundamental (photo)physical insights: from bulk to nano
EB, HB and HP display outstanding photophysical properties thanks to the shared presence of Cu2+ in their lattices.93 These ions represent the only color center in the crystals and determine the common features of the spectra of EB, HB and HP. As described by Pozza et al.,85 the square planar geometry of Cu2+ originates from lattice constraints and the Jahn–Teller effect. Within the frame of ligand-field theory, the silicates are thus characterized by three distinct absorption transitions: 2B1g → 2A1g, 2B1g → 2Eg and 2B1g → 2B2g. These are parity-forbidden d–d transitions which are nevertheless (weakly) allowed thanks to coupling with unsymmetrical vibrational modes. The resulting absorption features cover a broad green-red region of the visible spectrum (2B1g → 2A1g, 2B1g → 2Eg, λ ≈ 450–800 nm) and extend till the beginning of the NIR window (2B1g → 2B2g, λ ≈ 800–850 nm).49,61,91 The fluorescence, on the other side, is uniquely ascribed to the 2B2g → 2B1g transition and has been reported in the ranges of λ ≈ 920–960 nm. As a result of ligand-field changes induced by the larger size of Ba2+ ions (compared to Ca2+), the emissions of HP and HB are slightly red-shifted (with HB stretching up to 1000 nm).85,94–96 Furthermore, the parity-forbidden nature of the electronic transition of the copper ion leads to a remarkably long excited state lifetime (τ). Although different sample preparation routes are known to affect the value of τ, the decay time still lies in the μs range for EB, HB and HP alike, regardless of the synthetical procedure: more specifically, τEB ≈ 100–150 μs, τHB ≈ 60–100 μs, τHP ≈ 6–30 μs.74,85,95–97 Another outstanding feature of this class of silicates is represented by the quantum yield (QY). Accorsi et al. were the first to report a QY of bulk EB: ≈10.5%,95 a value which is considerably high if compared to typical NIR fluorophores.23 In a similar way, promising QYs for HB have also been measured (QYHB ≈ 6.9% was reported for hydrothermally synthesized HB67), whereas the presence of the Cu–Cu bond in HP leads to a clear quantum efficiency decrease (QYHP ≈ 0.9%, again synthesized through a hydrothermal approach66). By employing a novel technique based on temperature measurements in full sunlight instead of the traditional de Mello method,98 Berdahl et al. measured even higher QYs for EB and (La and Li doped) HB, with values of EB exceeding 70%.97 Additional theoretical studies have highlighted the potential benefits of material doping,99,100 and provided further insights towards electronic and magnetic properties of bulk EB, HB and HP.49,101 For example, the works by García-Fernández et al. have explained that, in order to fully understand the hue of EB and HB, the presence of a normally neglected internal electric field and the contribution of sand in the production process are of paramount importance.102,103 Furthermore, a bright and broadband photon up-conversion of EB and HB has been demonstrated by Chen et al., showing that emission in the Vis region is possible via pumping with a NIR laser diode.63,104 Binet et al. have also very recently further investigated the origins of the NIR luminescence of EB and shown that it can be more efficiently excited in the UV range; this is possible given the existence of four UV-excited emissions that are most likely determined by the presence of trapped excitons of different origins.105 HP, on the other side, possesses unique spin gapped antiferromagnetic properties due to its characteristic Cu–Cu dimers.66,106–110
Properties as the ones discussed above already clearly highlight the potential of bulk EB, HB and HP. When it comes to down-sizing a material, most of the times the hope is that the promising bulk properties are either retained or even improved by becoming tunable, size-dependent features. With regards to the effect of down-scaling, it was hypothesized that EB could turn into a direct band-gap semiconductor and work as a mechano-sensor if its thickness were reduced down to the monolayer regime (≈1 nm).87,96 However, only in the last years thorough insights on fundamental properties of EB-NS, HB-NS and HP-NS have been collected. The seminal studies of Johnson-McDaniel et al.89 and Salguero et al.90 first demonstrated that NIR fluorescence of EB and HB is preserved when the silicates are exfoliated down to μm-large NS of monolayer thickness. With the goal of understanding how the absorption/excitation and fluorescence features vary at the nanoscale, Selvaggio et al. carried out a thorough characterization of milled and tip-sonicated EB-NS, HB-NS and HP-NS.72,74 By observing the 1D emission (Fig. 4a) and 2D excitation–emission spectra (Fig. 4b), it could be confirmed that the bulk features are retained in the NS samples. By means of NIR fluorescence microscopy, the bleaching behavior of these silicates could be compared to state-of-the-art fluorophores. EB-NS, HB-NS and HP-NS were extremely stable and could all be imaged for up to 2 h without any significant effect on the emitted fluorescence intensity (Fig. 4c). On the other side, the signal of a standard visible fluorophore rhodamine B decreased quickly. An important step forward in comprehending the photophysics of these nanomaterials was represented by NIR fluorescence microscopy of resolution-limited NS (Fig. 4d). A bright, fluorescent signal could indeed be detected for EB-NS, HB-NS and HP-NS also with sizes below Abbe's resolution limit (corresponding to <500 nm for the considered emission wavelengths). Via correlation studies based on dual SEM-NIR imaging and particle tracking, Selvaggio et al. furthermore showed that EB-NS down to just few tenths of nm still fluoresce. Next to the robustness of fluorescence intensity, the versatility of fluorescence lifetime111 could be showcased, too. Time-correlated single photon counting measurements (TCSPC, Fig. 4e) yielded lifetime values τ which were on one side lower than the bulk counterparts, but on the other side still in the μs range. Frequency-domain lifetime imaging at both microscopic (Fig. 4f) and macroscopic (Fig. 4g) scales additionally underlined an important and promising aspect of EB-NS, HB-NS and HP-NS: the potential for lifetime engineering. Indeed, NS of different sizes led to subpopulations of different lifetime values within the lifetime-encoded images. Next to that, both at microscopic and macroscopic (remote) lifetime setups, it was possible to clearly distinguish the signals of EB-NS, HB-NS and HP-NS, which would otherwise be undistinguishable via standard imaging acquisitions based on fluorescence intensity. The above-mentioned results, together with the lack of fluorescence polarization of the NS, their facile remote detection and their biocompatible nature justify the employment of these exfoliated silicates in numerous technological fields, as described in the next section.72,74

Applications in state-of-the-art technologies
EB, HB and HP are not merely pigments of historical interest, but also materials of high promise for numerous applications. The earliest and perhaps most straightforward example of exploitation of their photophysical properties has been their detection in ancient artifacts. Indeed, thanks to a broad excitation range, a strong NIR fluorescence and a long excited state lifetime, the signals of HB, HP and, above all, of the highly chemically stable EB can be easily discriminated in artworks from other pigments.50–53,95,112–114 However, exciting speculations about the employment of bulk EB, HB and HP in diverse technological fields have been made, including telecommunications, lasers, sensing/labelling for bioimaging, component of cool roofing and facades, luminescent solar concentrators and more.50,55,58,59,66,69,91,95,97
With regards to the down-sized EB, HB and HP, several applications for photonics have been theorized and demonstrated (Tables 1–3). For example, Borisov et al. have showcased applications of ball-milled EB, HB and a strontium homologue (SrCuSi4O10, SC) as optical chemosensors.91 Indeed, milled and silanized EB could be successfully employed in pH sensors with a ratiometric design: aza-BODIPYs were used as indicators due to their pH-sensitive luminescence, whereas the bright and stable NIR fluorescence of EB was used as reference (Fig. 5a(i)). The bright long-lived luminescence of EB enables a further sensing technique: dual lifetime referencing (DLR). Based on this concept, a fiber-optic DLR-pH sensor with an aza-BODIPY and EB respectively as indicator and reference material was fabricated (Fig. 5a(ii)). Their long excited state lifetime, as well as their characteristic high (photo)chemical stability and their inertness to oxygen, define EB and other copper silicate phosphors as optimal DLR references. Furthermore, Borisov et al. demonstrated that μm-sized EB can be incorporated into ratiometric inner filter effect CO2 sensors (Fig. 5a(iii)). In this case, EB appeared as an ideal reference due to the broad excitation spectrum, which mostly overlaps with the one of m-cresol purple, i.e. the indicator (Fig. 5a(iv)). According to this sensing scheme, considering that m-cresol's absorption is responsive to different pressures of CO2, the fluorescence intensity of EB results accordingly modulated. Finally, Borisov et al. showed a temperature dependence of the luminescence decay time of EB, HB and SC. Due to moderate dependence at ambient T and improved sensitivity at high T (i.e. T ≈ 100–400 °C), these materials allow intrinsic T compensation of the sensing materials and present excellent suitability as high-temperature thermographic phosphors (Fig. 5a(v)). Inspired by the approach of Borisov et al., Maierhofer et al.115 have afterwards published another example of DLR sensor based on ball-milled and silanized EB. In this case, the silicate was embedded into an emulsion system for which three different aza-BODIPYs were tested as indicator materials to detect ammonia. Thanks to a fluorescence quenching mechanism based on the deprotonation of the hydroxy group of the dyes, gaseous NH3 could be detected throughout a broad range of concentrations (Fig. 5b). Milling has also been used by Tyler et al.75 to yield EB-NS of lateral size ≈ 100 nm for energy storage applications. More specifically, it has been shown that EB-NS can be employed as anode material for Li-ion batteries displaying decent values of reversible capacity, high coulombic efficiencies and an increase in capacity with cycling time (Fig. 5c). Most interestingly, X-ray diffractometry (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) have confirmed that lithiation leads to a conversion reaction of EB-NS into amorphous mixed oxides with copper nanoclusters.

Perhaps the most versatile type of NS photonics application has been presented by Johnson-McDaniel et al.57,89 and Salguero et al.90 with the preparation of smart inks. Via prolonged hot stirring and ultrasonication, high aspect ratio EB-NS and HB-NS could be produced and their colloidal dispersions could be employed as NS ink. As proof-of-principle experiments and to highlight the applicability of solution-processable NS, square patterns were printed (Fig. 5d(i and ii)) and free-standing NS samples were prepared (Fig. 5d(iii)). Despite the exfoliation, inks of EB-NS and HB-NS were still strongly fluorescent in the NIR, thus suggesting that these materials could be employed for e.g. NIR-based biomedical imaging, IR light-emitting devices such as telecommunication platforms, and security ink formulations.
Another technological sector where EB-NS’ outstanding properties led to a high interest of the scientific community is latent fingermark detection. For this task, it is crucial to employ powders which yield the maximum contrast in relation to the surface they are applied onto. Considered the inhomogeneity of most imaged samples (Fig. 5e(i)), fingerprint dusting powders which additionally display luminescence can further facilitate this task. Most of the commercially available materials, however, fluoresce in the visible with excitation in the UV range. Due to the strong background interference given by the frequent presence of e.g. inks, binders and coatings on the investigated backgrounds (e.g. banknotes), the signal-to-noise ratio is typically limited. As King et al.116 pointed out, the benefit of employing a powder whose fluorescence lies in the NIR region would be substantial. A further improvement would be represented by excitation at NIR wavelengths. As described in the previous sections, EB-NS can be excited both in the visible and in the NIR regions (λmax,NIR ≈ 780 nm). The high chemical–physical stability and its robustness to exfoliation make EB-NS excellent candidates for latent fingermark detection (Fig. 5e(ii–v)). Similarly to King et al.,116 Errington et al.78 tested EB-NS on different surfaces and compared the results to state-of-the-art dusting powders. Additionally, the effect of different milling conditions was tested. Significant progress in terms of sensitivity, selectivity and adhesion was achieved by Shahbazi et al.92 In their work it was found that a lipophilic coating of EB-NS with cetrimonium bromide (CTAB, Table 4) can endow the exfoliated silicates with a higher attraction towards oily components and moisture common to fingermark secretions. In conclusion, lipophilic coatings and exfoliation routes appear very promising for this application.117

Especially in the last 5 years, several works have been published by numerous research groups regarding applications of EB-NS, HB-NS and HP-NS for biomedical purposes. As already mentioned in the introductory section, there is a high scientific interest in developing new NIR-emitting dyes and nanomaterials for biological imaging due to the achievable higher tissue penetration and contrast, as well as due to the current scarcity of available NIR fluorophores. In 2020 and 2021, Selvaggio et al.72,74 demonstrated that EB-NS, HB-NS and HP-NS can be robustly employed as NIR fluorophores for biophotonics. Next to characterization measurements focused on the exfoliation protocols, proof-of-principle applications were reported to show how the bright and photostable NIR emission of the NS enables fluorescence microscopy and remote imaging of biological samples. Although the NIR-II wavelength region (λ ≈ 1000–1700 nm) is typically more desirable for higher tissue penetration, the NIR-I window (λ ≈ 750–1000 nm), within which the emission of EB-NS, HB-NS and HP-NS is located, allows strong fluorescent signals to be detected also by non-specialized and cheaper equipment (e.g. visible Si-based cameras rather than the expensive InGaAs ones). Indeed, a Si-based camera was employed to image EB-NS after injection into fruit fly embryos (Drosophila melanogaster, Fig. 6a(i)). Thanks to the lack of bleaching displayed by the NS and the absence of sample autofluorescence, long-term imaging with frame rates of 10 Hz could be performed. In this way, in vivo particle tracking revealed active processes within the developing embryos (Fig. 6a(ii)). EB-NS could also be easily detected in a simple and non-optimized home-made remote detection setup. Indeed, the emission brightness of EB-NS after infiltration into plant leaves was intense enough to withstand leaf autofluorescence and reach the detector from a distance > 10 cm (Fig. 6b). Furthermore, remote EB-NS signals observed at this setup were much stronger than other state-of-the-art NIR fluorophores, including single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) and indocyanine green (ICG). By means of tissue phantom experiments performed with a NIR (InGaAs) camera, it was additionally proven that the fluorescence of EB-NS, HB-NS and HP-NS could be detected through several layers of meat, thus underlining their potential for deep tissue imaging (Fig. 6c).

While the bright and photostable NS fluorescence presents clear advantages for labeling of biological systems, it also presents several benefits as reference signal for ratiometric sensing of biomolecules. This concept was recently demonstrated for the case of remote detection of bacterial strains by Nißler et al.,73 who developed NIR fluorescent nanosensor arrays composed of SWCNTs and EB-NS. According to this sensor design, different SWCNTs were chemically modified so to detect released metabolites and virulence factors, whereas the EB-NS worked as reference signal. The nanomaterials were embedded into hydrogel disks, which were then exposed to isolates of six clinically relevant bacteria (Fig. 6d(i)). By following the fluorescence modulation over time, these multiplexed nanosensors yielded spatially and spectrally encoded patterns of the analyzed pathogens (Fig. 6d(ii)). With the implementation of principal component analysis (PCA), a fingerprint and identification of different bacterial strains could be achieved (Fig. 6d(iii)). The successful remote detection of such sensors paves the way towards the creation of smart implants and sensing technologies, which could allow faster in situ diagnostics of infections.
Biomedical applications of NS are definitely not limited to exploiting their bright NIR fluorescence. Yang et al.76 showed in 2018 that high aspect ratio EB-NS of just a few layers of thickness are highly selective towards multi-phosphopeptides. In several pH and buffer conditions, EB-NS managed to selectively bind to the tetra-phosphorylated peptides β3m and β4m without enriching the mono-phosphopeptides β1s and β2s (Fig. 7a). The same effect was not observed when testing HB-NS and the Sr homologue SC-NS. This could indicate that the high specific surface area of EB-NS with numerous Ca2+ ions is responsible for its higher selectivity. Direct measurements of phosphopeptides via mass spectrometry (MS) are normally affected by low sensitivity and ionization efficiency. Mono-phosphorylated peptides are preferentially ionized, thus dominating in the measured spectrum. Even if several strategies have been developed for separation of mono- and multi-phosphopeptides, only few of the materials designed so far have proven to efficiently distinguish them. For these reasons, the highly selective EB-NS can be defined as very promising substrates for the study of protein phosphorylation.

Several studies have shown that EB-NS absorb NIR irradiation (as a result of the d–d electronic transitions) and convert it into heat. The high photothermal conversion efficiency of EB-NS (which has been calculated to be in the range of ≈34–42%118–120) and their robust photostability suggest that EB-NS have high potential as agent for photothermal therapy (PTT). Furthermore, release of bioactive Cu2+ and SiO44− ions from EB-NS promotes angiogenesis and re-epithelization. In this way, EB-NS can carry out a crucial task also in terms of cancer surgery-induced and chronic wound healing. Within this frame, Yu et al.118 have recently reported a multi-functional biocomposite made of electrospun fibers on whose surface EB-NS were spin-coated. In vitro and in vivo experiments on tumor-bearing mice showed that such platforms could simultaneously allow cell proliferation (due to their biocompatible nature) and effectively kill skin tumor cells, in this way aiding tissue reconstruction (Fig. 7b). Similarly promising results have been obtained by He et al.,77 who embedded EB-NS into a 3D-printed scaffold (CaPCu) and observed successful PTT and tissue regeneration in osteosarcoma (OS) cell lines (Fig. 7c). By means of mRNA transcriptome analysis, He et al. also observed a regulatory effect of CaPCu on genes relevant for cell death, proliferation and bone development. Some other works have almost exclusively focused on the beneficial properties of ion release from EB. Although Zhang et al.121 did not explicitly describe an exfoliation protocol, they reported the preparation of a novel fibrous EB-containing membrane in combination with the flavonoid quercetin for hair regeneration in burned skin. Going further in the direction of wound healing, other studies have implemented advanced materials science concepts for the design of the novel multifunctional composites. The papers from Yang et al.119 and Dong et al.120 describe two works that share similar traits: in both cases, a biocomposite (CUP/PT) based on EB-NS (CUP) and a shape-memory polymer (poly(D,L-lactide-co-trimethylene carbonate), PT) was prepared. The ability of EB-NS to convert NIR-II light into heat was exploited to trigger the shape-memory behavior of PT. As previously mentioned, the use of NIR-II light (λ ≈ 1000–1700 nm) in place of NIR-I wavelengths (λ ≈ 750–1000 nm) is beneficial because it allows higher tissue penetration. In this way, under low power irradiation, Yang et al.119 reported an outstanding self-knotting ability of CUP/PT, which was exploited for the design of sutures. The simultaneous sustained release of EB-NS ions (Cu2+ and SiO44−) could furthermore lead to in vitro and in vivo stimulation of angiogenesis, thus enabling a “smart” wound healing approach (Fig. 7d). Tubular CUP/PT composites were similarly employed in vitro and in vivo by Dong et al.120 as intelligent antiadhesion barrier for intrauterine adhesions with the capacity of simultaneously stimulating endometrial regeneration.
Conclusions
Egyptian Blue (EB), Han Blue (HB) and Han Purple (HP) are materials that have an ancient history and have been used by famous past civilizations. Next to the cultural heritage in world-known artworks, these silicates have recently gained a new life thanks to their outstanding chemical and photophysical properties. This interest has been moving from the bulk material to the nanoscale counterparts. Indeed, the layered crystal structures of EB, HB and HP allow exfoliation down to 2D nanomaterials, i.e. nanosheets (NS), which retain the most relevant features while benefiting from their reduced size and high aspect ratio. Several works have outlined exfoliation routes which yield NS structures down to monolayer thicknesses, however most of them do not describe the obtained size distribution, are time-consuming and/or report NS diameters of several microns. These issues can constitute limiting factors for certain applications and should thus be addressed in future works. For instance, if NS sizes are not small enough (nm range), the employment in biological systems could be hindered in terms of uptake and biocompatibility. Long exfoliation protocols might instead represent an obstacle for scalability of the prepared samples, thus resulting less appealing for industrial applications. Focus on more sophisticated and at the same time more efficient methods of exfoliation (e.g. surfactant-mediated sonication) might enable a stronger control over the obtained NS sizes, and therefore allow further tailoring of layer thickness. In this way, it could be experimentally investigated whether the fluorescence of NS monolayers can be affected by the chemical environment around the more exposed copper ions and/or by applied strain, as foreseen by past theoretical studies. Although some fundamental photophysical insights have been gained in the last years, there are still many open questions and, thus, several directions of research worth following next. For instance, it is clear that the synthesis has a strong impact on fundamental photophysical properties (e.g. quantum yield), therefore its full comprehension and control could lead to immediate benefits in numerous applications. To this end, also size-fluorescence correlation studies and robust quantum yield measurements of well-defined samples are of paramount importance to assess the full potential of novel NIR fluorophores. Furthermore, tailoring of material doping and employment of novel/alternative excitation (e.g. UV) and detection (e.g. fluorescence lifetime) methods could respectively allow to tune the photophysics and further extend the applicability of these materials, as already indicated by recently published works. In terms of material doping, the incorporation of defect states could perhaps lead to novel properties similar to quantum defects in SWCNTs.122–124 Moreover, tailoring of surface chemistry is a crucial step to improve water solubility and allow targeting of molecules of interest, as required for e.g. drug delivery and image-guided surgery. Although first examples of functionalization have been reported in literature, this topic is currently still mostly unexplored and therefore demands attention (Table 4).125,126 Nevertheless, numerous publications have already clearly highlighted the extreme versatility and high promise of EB-NS, HB-NS and HP-NS for multiple and diverse technological fields, including smart inking, energy storage, biological imaging and sensing, photothermal cancer therapy, tissue engineering and more. It is therefore our strong belief that many exciting chapters featuring these novel nanomaterials are soon to be written.

 	Fig. 4  Photophysical properties of exfoliated silicate nanosheets. (a) 1D fluorescence spectra of EB-NS, HB-NS and HP-NS with emission maxima between λ ≈ 920–950 nm (λexc = 561 nm). (b) 2D excitation–emission spectra of EB-NS, HB-NS and HP-NS, showing maximal absorption at λ ≈ 630 nm, 620 nm and 680 nm respectively, as well as no significant alteration compared to the bulk fluorescent features. (c) Photobleaching experiments show that the fluorescence signals are stable over prolonged excitation (t > 2 h, output power ≈ 100–180 mW) in contrast to standard organic fluorophores (e.g. rhodamine B). (d) Near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence microscopy and NIR-SEM correlative imaging of resolution-limited EB-NS. Scale bar = 1 μm (NIR) and 200 nm (SEM). (e) Time correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) curves of nanosheets for lifetime measurements and the corresponding double-exponential fits. (f) Microscopic frequency-domain fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) of EB-NS displaying size-dependence. Color-coding is given by the corresponding phasor plot. Scale bar = 5 μm. (g) Macroscopic FLIM of the logo of the Ruhr-University of Bochum (RUB) written with NS ink: while the signals of EB-, HB- and HP-NS appear undistinguishable according to the intensity channel, the lifetime clearly enables NS identification.

EB has also been employed for ratiometric inner filter effect CO2 sensors (iii), where the good overlap of absorption features of EB and deprotonated m-cresol purple (MCP) was exploited (iv). 1 = Deprotonated MCP (low pCO2), 2 = protonated MCP (high pCO2), 3 = EB. Furthermore, the temperature dependence of luminescence intensity and decay time of EB, HB and the strontium homologue (SrCuSi4O10) highlight potential as T sensors (v).
