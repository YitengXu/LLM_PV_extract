    , Accepted 29th March 2019First published on 29th March 2019AbstractIn this study, we experimentally demonstrated the fabrication of a passively Q-switched Nd:YAG laser using a hybrid organic–inorganic methylammonium lead halide (CH3NH3PbI3) perovskite as a saturable absorber (SA). The broadband linear transmittance in the 0.3–1.1 μm range and the nonlinear optical absorption at 1064 nm were measured. The CH3NH3PbI3 SA exhibited large nonlinear saturable absorption with a modulation depth and saturation intensity equal to 3.9% and 6.5 MW cm−2, respectively. Using the CH3NH3PbI3 SA, a stable Q-switched laser operation with a maximum average output power of 388 mW corresponding to a pulse width of 192 ns was achieved. Thus, the CH3NH3PbI3 film is an efficient SA candidate for stable lasers and has great potential as a broadband nonlinear optical material for ultrafast photonics.
1. Introduction
The incorporation of saturable absorbers (SAs) into passively Q-switched lasers improves laser performance, reduces their fabrication and operation costs and helps to achieve more compact lasers with excellent mechanical stability, short pulses and high peak power.1,2 SAs, as nonlinear optical modulation components, play an essential role in generating short laser pulses.3,4 Different kinds of SAs have been developed for lasers, including semiconductor saturable absorber mirrors (SESAMs),5,6 carbon nanotubes, graphene, graphene oxide, topological insulators, transitional metallic dichalcogenides, and black phosphorus.7–22 Hybrid organic–inorganic perovskites (such as CH3NH3PbI3), with a direct band gap nature of the charge carrier transition, are some of the most promising optoelectronic materials23,24 because of their low cost and high-performance in optoelectronic devices.25
The current conversion efficiencies of perovskite-based solar cells exceed 22.7%.26 Perovskites also demonstrate other excellent properties such as wavelength tunability,27 long carrier diffusion length,28 high fluorescence yield,29 all of which are suitable for a variety of novel optoelectronic applications for light-emitting diodes,30 lasers,31 waveguides,32 and photodetectors.33 Because of all these properties and the recent rapid development of nanotechnology, the remarkable physical properties of the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite have attracted significant attention.34 Lasers, including Q-switched and mode-locked ones, based on a CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite saturable absorber (CH3NH3PbI3–SA) were also studied.35–38 CH3NH3PbI3 possesses saturable absorption effects and can maintain excellent absorption under high-intensity irradiation, which helps to realize a large-energy pulsed laser. However, only one study on the CH3NH3PbI3 absorber for solid-state lasers was reported to the best of our knowledge,36 in which the maximum average output power was 29 mW, and the pulse width was 305 ns.
This paper reports the fabrication of low cost CH3NH3PbI3 film deposited on a quartz plate with the goal of using it as an SA for passively Q-switched Nd:YAG lasers. The broadband linear transmittance in the 0.3–1.1 μm range and the nonlinear optical absorption at 1064 nm were measured. The CH3NH3PbI3–SA exhibited excellent nonlinear saturable absorption with a modulation depth and saturation intensity equal to 3.9% and 6.5 MW cm−2, respectively. Using this SA, a stable Q-switched laser operation with a maximum average output power equal to 388 mW corresponding to 192 ns pulse width was achieved. The work experimentally demonstrated that the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite is a suitable SA for the next generation of nanosecond pulse solid-state lasers.
2. Experimental section
The as-prepared CH3NH3PbI3–SA was inserted into the designed linear cavity as shown in Fig. 1. The Nd:YAG crystal (3 mm × 3 mm × 5 mm) was cut in the [111] direction and doped with 1.2 at% of Nd3+. One of the end surfaces of the crystal was coated with a high transmission film (transmitting at 808 nm) and a high reflection (HR) film (reflecting at 1064 nm). This crystal was pumped using a 808 nm diode laser (LD) with 30 W maximum output power. The laser cavity was designed to be 1 cm long. The output coupler (OC) (radius of curvature R = 50 mm) was an OC with 9% transmission at 1064 nm. The crystal temperature was maintained at 16 °C by a water-cooled copper mount, using cooling equipment to maintain a stable laser output. The CH3NH3PbI3–SA was inserted into the laser cavity close to the OC. The filter (NF808-34, Thorlabs) was used to remove the pump laser, which can restrict the laser of the central wavelength (808 ± 34 nm). A photodetector (DET10 A/M, Thorlabs, Inc., U.S.) and a 1 GHz oscilloscope (TDS5000B, Tektronix, Inc., U.S.) were used for the measurement.

3. Results and discussion
3.1. CH3NH3PbI3–SA fabrication and characterization
A quartz plate (QP, JGS3, Φ 20 mm × 0.5 mm, SIOM, China) substrate was ultrasonicated with deionized water, alcohol and acetone (for 15 minutes with each solvent). An anti-solvent assisted spin-coating technique was used to deposit the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite film on this QP using 1.5 M dimethyl formamide/dimethyl sulfoxide (at 4:1 volume ratio) solution mixed with PbI2/CH3NH3I (at 1:1 volume ratio). The film was deposited at 6000 rpm for 30 seconds, followed by a diethyl ether drip after spinning. A photograph of the QP with the deposited CH3NH3PbI3–SA is shown as an inset in Fig. 2(b). A scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Hitachi S-4800, Japan) image is shown in Fig. 2(a). It shows a dense-grained uniform morphology and the entire film is composed of a pinhole-free and well-crystallized compact CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite film.

The entire film was composed of a pinhole-free and well-crystallized compact CH3NH3PbI3–SA perovskite according to the X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis performed using Rigaku D Max 2500 (Japan) (see Fig. 2(b)). The main XRD diffraction peaks of CH3NH3PbI3 were observed at 14.1° and 28.5°, which matched the (110) and (220) planes of the perovskite,39,40 respectively. The thicknesses of the CH3NH3PbI3–SA films were investigated by atomic force microscopy (AFM, Bruker Dimension ICON, Germany) measurement. Fig. 2(c) shows an AFM image of the CH3NH3PbI3–SA films, confirming that their thickness is uniform, as observed from the cross-sectional height profile shown in Fig. 2(d). To determine the CH3NH3PbI3–SA film's thicknesses, three different sections were chosen for the measurements (see Fig. 2(d)). The thicknesses of the CH3NH3PbI3–SA films were between 415 and 444 nm.
3.2. Optical properties of CH3NH3PbI3–SA
The linear transmission spectra were recorded using a UV-Lambda 950 (PerkinElmer, U.S.) spectrophotometer. The transmittance of the CH3NH3PbI3–SA was 78.4% at 1064 nm (see Fig. 3(a)). The transmittance of the film changed as the wavelength increased. Low transmittance in the visible band is beneficial for solar cell development. High transmittance at 1 μm is promising for 1 μm-solid-state lasers. Non-linear optical response of the CH3NH3PbI3–SA was also characterized using the balanced synchronous twin-detector technique. The twin-detector (919P-003-10/919P-010-16, Newport, Inc., U.S.) was used for the measurement. The laser source was a custom-built mode-locked Nd:YAG solid state laser with 1064 nm central wavelength, 28 ps pulse duration and 120 MHz repetition rate. Non-linear optical transmission data are shown in Fig. 3(b). Experimental data were fitted using the following equation:2T(I) = 1 − αsexp(−I/Isat) − Tns, where T(I) is the transmission, αs is the modulation depth, I is the input intensity, Isat is the saturation intensity and Tns is the non-saturable loss. The modulation depth and saturation intensity of the CH3NH3PbI3–SA were 3.9% and 6.5 MW cm−2, respectively.

3.3. A passively Q-switched laser with CH3NH3PbI3–SA
In the continuous wave (CW) operation mode, the threshold of the absorbed pump power was 1.1 W. The threshold pump power for the diode pumped passively using a Q-switched Nd:YAG laser with the CH3NH3PbI3–SA was 3 W when a designed linear cavity was used. A stable passive Q-switching (QS) operation was achieved when the pump power exceeds 3.5 W. During passive QS, the pulse duration and repetition rate were different at different pump powers. Fig. 4(a) shows three groups of pulse trains corresponding to 4 W, 4.5 W and 5 W pump power. The higher the pump power, the more pulses were generated, and the narrower the pulse duration. In addition, Fig. 4(b) indicates that the narrowest pulse duration of 192 ns was at 5 W pump power. The relationship between the output power and the absorbed pump power is illustrated in Fig. 4(c). As the pump power increased, the output power of the CW laser gradually increased. The highest slope efficiency was 42.2%. Upon slightly tuning the cavity mirrors, the average output power increased linearly with the pump power. The maximum average output power was 388 mW with respect to the 5 W pump power. The slope efficiency was 15.8%. Evolution of the pulse width and repetition rate with the incident pump power is displayed in Fig. 4(d). The pulse width varied from 540.4 ns to 192 ns, and the repetition rate changed from 143.3 kHz to 337 kHz as the pump power increased. The single pulse energy and the peak power of QS pulses as a function of the pump power are presented in Fig. 4(e). The largest single pulse energy was 1.51 μJ, and the highest peak power was 5.99 W when the pump power reached 5 W. Compared to the results obtained from the CH3NH3PbI3 based Q-switched Nd:YGG laser,36 both the average output power and the generated pulse duration improved. The quality of the perovskite CH3NH3PbI3 film prepared by our method is higher than that prepared by the two-step method in ref. 36. The former can effectively control the perovskite nuclei and growth process, and therefore the film surface is uniform and flat, which can decrease the optical scattering on the absorber. In addition, the end mirror is bonded with the gain medium so that our laser cavity length is decreased to 10 mm, which may lead to a shorter pulse width and a larger average output power. The QS laser spectrum was recorded using an optical spectrum analyzer (YOKOGAWA, AQ6370D) with 0.02 nm resolution. The central wavelength of the QS laser was at 1063.2 nm with a 3-dB bandwidth equal to 0.186 nm (see Fig. 4(f)).

High-quality CH3NH3PbI3–SA was fabricated by spin-coating and characterized by SEM, XRD and AFM. The linear transmission was 78.4% at 1064 nm. The modulation depth and saturable intensity of the CH3NH3PbI3 film were 3.9% and 6.5 MW cm−2, respectively. With this SA, a stable Q-switched laser operation with a maximum average output power equal to 388 mW and a pulse width equal to 192 ns was achieved. The average output power of the laser reported in this work is better than those reported in the literature for perovskites as SAs (see comparison in Table 1).

In conclusion, we have reported a low-cost, high quality, solution processable nonlinear optical component based on an automatic crystallized CH3NH3PbI3. We have investigated the nonlinear optical responses of the CH3NH3PbI3. The CH3NH3PbI3–SA exhibits obvious nonlinear absorption performance with a modulation depth of 3.9% and a saturation intensity of 6.5 MW cm−2. We demonstrated the application of the CH3NH3PbI3–SA for a passively Q-switched Nd:YAG laser. The maximum average output power was 388 mW, and the pulse width was 192 ns. Experimental results demonstrated in this work indicate that the CH3NH3PbI3 is a suitable SA for nanosecond pulse generation in high-power solid state lasers.
