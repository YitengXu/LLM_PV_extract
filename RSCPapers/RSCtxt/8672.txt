    , Accepted 12th June 2023First published on 13th June 2023AbstractThe interfacial photocatalysis of metal oxide electron transport layers (ETLs), especially TiO2, in organometal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has detrimental effects on device stability. Herein, a UV absorber, 4,4′-oxybisbenzoic acid (OBBA), was first utilized as a modification layer between TiO2 and perovskite against UV photocatalytic degradation. Owing to the strong UV filtration capability and coordination effect of OBBA molecules, the harmful UV light was filtered and the oxygen vacancies on the TiO2 surface were eliminated, which significantly suppressed the interfacial photocatalysis reaction, and the photocatalytic degradation mechanism of perovskite under UV irradiation was proposed for the first time. Moreover, the uncoordinated Pb2+ defects at the buried interface were passivated and the energy band alignment was optimized. Consequently, the modified device presented a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of up to 22.14% and excellent stability under extreme UV irradiation (365 nm, 600 mW cm−2; 275 nm, 10 mW cm−2).
1. Introduction
The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of organometallic halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has boosted from 3.8% to 25.7% in the past decade, which is attributed to their advantages of adjustable direct band gap, high absorption coefficient, excellent defect tolerance, and long carrier diffusion length.1–3 However, the long-term stability of PSCs is still a serious issue for practical applications, which is needed to be overcome. In fact, the stability of PSCs was influenced by various environmental conditions, including oxygen, moisture, ultraviolet (UV) light, and heat.4–6 In particular, UV light constitutes approximately 3–5% of the total solar spectrum and is an unavoidable factor in the practical application of solar cells.7 While moisture and oxygen erosion can be readily isolated through encapsulation, the harmful effects of UV irradiation cannot be eliminated under working conditions, particularly in plateau and space environments.8,9 Therefore, addressing the issue of perovskite absorber degradation caused by UV exposure is crucial for successful commercialization.
As is well known, photocatalysis is a widely used technique in the fields of environment and energy owing to its ability to use light to initiate chemical reactions.10,11 However, the photocatalytic reaction is generally undesirable in photovoltaic devices, the potent photocatalytic activity of metal oxide electron transport layers (ETLs), particularly TiO2, can have detrimental effects on the intrinsic stability of PSCs under UV irradiation.12–14 To date, tremendous efforts have been paid to suppressing the UV photocatalytic degradation, such as external UV screening, down-conversion strategy, and interfacial modification. For example, Ji et al. considered that the driving force of the photocatalytic degradation was derived from the conversion of Ti3+-VO to Ti4+-VO on the surface of TiO2 under UV irradiation, which was blocked by using a polyethyleneimine ethoxylated (PEIE) layer, resulting in a cell that retained approximately 75% of its initial efficiency after 72 days of UV exposure.15 Falaras and his coworkers introduced a hydrophobic Cu–TiO2 layer as an ETL, which significantly mitigated photocatalytic action and increased the conductivity and electron mobility of PSCs, and a champion cell showed a PCE up to 18.15% and about 91% of its original PCE under UV stress for 5 h (350–390 nm, 0.5 mW cm−2).16 A natural antioxidant lycopene was utilized in the perovskite precursor, the UV-induced free radicals in the target devices were eliminated and the crystal quality was enhanced. As a result, the PCE was increased from 20.57% to 23.62%, and the target device maintained 84% of its original PCE after 8 h UV irradiation.17 More recently, a “sunscreen” strategy based on the tautomeric molecule, 2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzophenone, was proposed for enhancing the UV endurance and passivating defects of PSCs, and the cell showed a PCE of as high as 23.09% with excellent UV stability under 285 and 365 nm UV irradiation.18 Chen et al. adopted a down-conversion strategy for preparing europium-doped TiO2 as an ETL, and the UV light was converted into useful visible luminescence, resulting in the enhancement of light harvesting and suppression of UV degradation.19 Obviously, these strategies can significantly enhance the UV stability of PSCs, but a deeper understanding and better solutions are still needed to illumine UV degradation.
Herein, a UV absorber, 4,4′-oxybisbenzoic acid (OBBA), was first utilized as a buried interface modifier for improving the UV stability and efficiency of PSCs, in which OBBA can effectively block UV light and eliminate the oxygen vacancies (VO) of TiO2, thus alleviating the decomposition of perovskite caused by the strong photocatalytic activity of TiO2. Based on the experimental results, a photocatalytic degradation mechanism of perovskite under UV irradiation was proposed. Moreover, the uncoordinated Pb2+ defects of the perovskite were significantly passivated and the energy band alignment was successfully optimized. As a result, PCEs of up to 22.14% and 18.51% were achieved for small (0.12 cm2) and large active area (1.02 cm2) devices, respectively. More importantly, an excellent UV resistance was obtained, and the modified device maintained ∼70% of its initial PCE after 72 h of extreme UV exposure (275 nm, 10 mW cm−2), which was attributed to the significant suppression of the interfacial photocatalysis reaction.
2. Results and discussion
The selection of OBBA was based on two main reasons. Firstly, it possesses an excellent ultraviolet absorption capability, which is essential for our goal of UV filtration. Secondly, according to previous studies, carbonyl can bond with uncoordinated Ti3+ and Pb2+, thereby eliminating Ti3+-VO and passivating Pb2+ defects. The surface potential of the OBBA molecule was evaluated by calculation of an electrostatic potential map (ESP) using DFT. As depicted in Fig. 1a, OBBA exhibited symmetrical charge distribution with the two carboxyl groups located at the terminals, showing an intense negative charge, which can effectively eliminate oxygen vacancies and bind with the uncoordinated Ti3+ on the surface of TiO2, thereby suppressing its photocatalytic activity.20 The UV filtration capability of OBBA was verified by UV-vis spectroscopy. As depicted in Fig. 1b, the OBBA molecule exhibited a strong UV absorption in the range of 270–300 nm, showing negligible influence on visible light. Such a characteristic can significantly mitigate the negative effects of UV irradiation without compromising visible light absorption. Fig. S1† displays the UV-vis spectra of each sample and Tauc plots calculated therefrom, an energy gap of about 3.2 eV was calculated. The UV-vis transmittance spectra of the ETL based at different concentrations of OBBA are shown in Fig. 1c; a gradually decreased transmittance in the UV region was observed when the concentration of OBBA was increased, which is consistent with the results of UV-vis absorption of OBBA molecules, indicating an effective UV light filtration and the successful deposition of OBBA. Furthermore, spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE) was employed to provide evidence of the existence of the OBBA layer and examine the thickness of the OBBA layer. The thickness change of OBBA before and after dropping DMF was compared based on the calculations and fitting results from SE (corresponding details are shown in the characterization section and Fig. S2 and S3 in the ESI†); the thickness of OBBA was determined to be about 11.9 nm before dropping DMF and 7.9 nm after dropping DMF.21,22 This not only demonstrates the successful deposition of OBBA but also confirms that the majority of the OBBA layer was retained. When OBBA was deposited on a rough mesoporous TiO2 substrate during the device fabrication, the actual thickness of OBBA was expected to be greater than that on the FTO substrate. As to why OBBA was not completely washed away, it could be attributed to two factors. Firstly, OBBA was heated at 80 °C after deposition, which enhanced its bonding with the substrate. Secondly, the spin-coating process started immediately after the addition of the perovskite precursor, resulting in a short contact time. Therefore, the majority of the OBBA layer was preserved. Meanwhile, FTIR spectroscopy was used to investigate the modification of OBBA atop the m-TiO2 surface. As illustrated in Fig. 1d, the prominent peak at 1678 cm−1 in the FTIR spectrum of OBBA corresponds to the stretching of CO. However, a significant redshift to 1656 cm−1 was observed in the FTIR spectrum of the OBBA–TiO2 sample, indicating a strong bonding effect between TiO2 and OBBA, which was achieved through the Lewis acid Ti3+.20 According to previous studies, the density of VO-Ti3+ states plays a crucial role in determining the photocatalytic activity of TiO2.23,24 In this context, the initial density of VO-Ti3+ states on TiO2 surface was measured by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). All the binding energy was calibrated from the C 1s peak (284.6 eV). The XPS spectra of Ti 2p were compared, as shown in Fig. 1e, in the case of pristine TiO2, the binding energies of the Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2 peaks were 458.38 and 464.14 eV, respectively. As for the TiO2–OBBA sample, a downshift of about 0.15 eV was detected in the binding energies of Ti 2p orbit, suggesting that the interaction between OBBA and TiO2 existed and the electron density around Ti3+/Ti4+ was increased.25 Furthermore, the Ti 2p spectra were split and fitted, as shown in Fig. S4.† After OBBA modification, the peak area ratio of Ti3+ was decreased from 7.15% to 5.41%, indicating that the VO-Ti3+ states were eliminated successfully, which is beneficial for reducing the photocatalytic activity of TiO2. Meanwhile, O 1s spectra of pristine TiO2 and TiO2–OBBA samples were recorded and fitted with Gaussian curves, as shown in Fig. 1f and g. Three peaks were detected at the binding energies of 529.5, 530.8, and 532.2 eV for lattice oxygen, oxygen vacancy, and absorbed oxygen, respectively.26 The lattice oxygen signal represents a fully-coordinated TiO2 with Ti4+ ions which are mainly presented in the bulk. The VO signal is ascribed to the oxygen vacancies in the matrix of the TiO2, and the adsorbed oxygen signal can be attributed to the chemically absorbed OBBA and O2 molecules on the TiO2 surface. XPS analysis indicates that the modification of OBBA substantially reduced the intensity of the VO peak, and the peak area ratio was decreased from 18.3% to 13.8%, which is in accordance with the analysis of Ti 2p. In addition, the peak area ratio of chemically-absorbed oxygen was increased from 8.5% to 11.6%, further confirming the existence of OBBA. To provide further evidence of the decrease in VO states, the electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR)-spin-trap technique was employed, as shown in Fig. S5.† The signal at 2.003 g factor is assigned to the VO states of TiO2, and a significant decrease was observed after OBBA modification.27 This indicates that VO states were successfully reduced, which is in line with the results of the XPS analysis.

To figure out the mechanism behind the stability improvement and the detail of the decomposition process of perovskite under UV irradiation, the unencapsulated devices were placed in a nitrogen-filled glovebox and exposed to a UV lamp (275 nm, 10 mW cm−2 or 365 nm, 600 mW cm−2) from the TiO2 ETL side at room temperature (Fig. S6†). All UV aging tests in this work were carried out under such irradiation intensities. Raman spectroscopy was used to observe and understand the degradation of PSCs under UV irradiation for the first time. Corresponding Raman spectra were collected and normalized, as shown in Fig. 2a and b. The peaks at 77 and 96 cm−1 are assigned to the vibrations of the Pb–I inorganic cage of perovskite crystal, while the peaks at 113, 143, and 166 cm−1 can be ascribed to the libration modes of cations, which is in good accordance with the theoretical calculations reported by Quarti et al.28,29 Obviously, both Pb–I inorganic cage and cations signal of the pristine sample were dropped significantly during 24 h of 275 nm UV irradiation due to the dramatic photocatalytic reaction at the interface. The decreased Pb–I signal indicates that the PbI6 octahedron decomposed into iodine and lead iodide and the inorganic framework of the perovskite crystal gradually collapses under UV irradiation. The decreased signal in the region of 100–200 cm−1 shows that the organic cations are progressively dissociated and volatilized from the lattice. However, the signal of the modified sample exhibited a significantly slowed decay rate in the same test condition, indicating a significant suppression of interfacial photocatalysis, which can be ascribed to the decreased photocatalytic activity and filtered UV light. To further study their stability under UV irradiation, XRD patterns (Fig. 2c and d) were conducted and the corresponding peak ratios (PbI2versus perovskite) were calculated to indicate the degradation extent. As illustrated in Fig. S7,† the ratio of the OBBA-modified sample increased much slower than that of the pristine sample, suggesting that OBBA modification can provide effective protection for PSCs from the drastic deterioration caused by UV irradiation. High-pressure ion chromatography (HPIC) was utilized to detect the decomposition product, CH3NH2, and further validated that the photocatalytic degradation has been suppressed. The corresponding experimental details are provided in SI and Fig. S8.† As shown in Fig. 2e, negligible CH3NH2 concentrations were detected before UV irradiation. However, a gradual increase in CH3NH2 gas was detected in both groups after turning on the light, but the increase in the OBBA-modified group was significantly smaller than that of the pristine group. Combining the results of Raman spectroscopy, these findings not only illustrated the irreversible decomposition of perovskite films can be attributed to cations escaping but also demonstrated that the OBBA modification layer can obviously inhibit the photocatalytic reaction. Furthermore, the PCE decay lifetime under UV irradiation was recorded, as shown in Fig. 6f, the pristine device exhibited a drastic reduction of PCE under UV irradiation, and only 27% of its initial value remained after continuous irradiation for 72 h, whereas the OBBA-modified device could retain 70% of its original PCE, demonstrating a significantly enhanced resistance to the extreme UV irradiation. In addition, PCE statistics of the pristine and OBBA-modified PSCs before and after UV illumination are shown in Fig. S9.† The average PCE of the OBBA group exhibited a 33% attenuation, whereas the original group experienced a 69% decline. This result clearly demonstrates that the improvement in UV stability was achieved through OBBA modification, highlighting the effectiveness and reproducibility of OBBA modification. In addition, Fig. S10–S12† shows the Raman spectra, XRD patterns, and PCE decay results under 365 nm UV irradiation, the results exhibited a similar tendency but a faster decline due to the excessive UV intensity. Besides, the photographs of PSCs under 275 nm UV exposure are shown in Fig. 2g, it was found that both the pristine and modified devices maintained a black phase in the initial 12 h. After that, the pristine device began a fast decomposition and degraded completely at 120 h, while the OBBA-modified device maintained the most black phase until the end of the test. On the basis of these observations and in accordance with the literature, the mechanism of interfacial photocatalysis degradation of PSCs can be proposed, as shown in Fig. 1h.15,30 The whole decomposition process can be represented by the eqn (1)–(5): (1) (2) (3) I2 + I− ⇌ I−3(4) 3CH3NH+3 + I−3 + 2Ti3+ → 3CH3NH2↑ + 3HI↑ + 2Ti4+(5)

Under UV irradiation, the photoexcited electrons and holes are produced and separated into the conduction band and valence band of TiO2, respectively (eqn (1)). The electrons have the tendency to be trapped and can reduce Ti4+ cations to Ti3+ states (eqn (2)). Simultaneously, the holes located in the valence band can oxidize I− in Pb–I octahedron cage (Pb2I2−6) to form PbI2 and I2 (eqn (3)). The generated I2 further combined with I− to generate I−3 reversibly (eqn (4)). In the last step, the CH3NH+3 cations in the lattices and the I−3 were reduced to CH3NH2 and HI gas by the reductive Ti3+, and escaped from the lattice (eqn (5)). With the continuous volatilization of the organic cation and the irreversible collapse of the inorganic crystal cage, this degradation spreads from the interface to the bulk of perovskite, thus triggering a fast and complete degradation of PSCs under UV irradiation. When the OBBA modification layer was introduced, it took advantage of its strong absorption in the UVb region (260–300 nm) to effectively filter UVb irradiation, which is known to be more harmful than UVa radiation within the UV wavelength range. While the absorption of OBBA in the UVa region may be limited, and TiO2 exhibited a strong photocatalytic activity within the UVa band, the presence of OBBA in the interface between TiO2 and perovskite can reduce the oxygen vacancies in the TiO2 layer, and suppress the photocatalytic ability of the TiO2 layer, thus slowing the degradation of perovskite films.
In addition to optical properties, the surface morphologies of ETL are also crucial for the subsequent deposition of perovskite layers and interfacial carrier extraction. SEM and AFM were used to observe the surface morphology change of the mesoporous TiO2 (m-TiO2) layer after modification. Fig. 3a shows the top-view SEM images of the TiO2 ETLs. It is evident that the surface morphology of the m-TiO2 layer became smoother and more uniform after OBBA modification, indicating a successful deposition of the OBBA layer. Furthermore, AFM was used to measure and reveal the surface roughness of both ETLs. As shown in Fig. 3b, the root mean square roughness (Rq) of the OBBA–TiO2 ETL was 26.9 nm, which is lower than that of the pristine ETL (31.0 nm), indicating that the buried interface contact and carrier extraction were optimized by OBBA modification. In addition, the wettability of both ETLs was also measured, as presented in Fig. S13.† The contact angle between ETL and perovskite precursor solution for the pristine ETL was 12.85°, and then decreased to 8.98° after modification. Improved wettability means easier processibility and lower interfacial nucleation energy of the perovskite layer.31 Meanwhile, the cross-sectional and top-view morphology of perovskite layers deposited on the corresponding ETLs are shown in Fig. 3c–e. In comparison to the pristine sample, the grain size of the perovskite films based on OBBA–TiO2 was slightly increased, corresponding grain size statistical results obtained from top view SEM are shown in Fig. 3f. The optimized crystal quality of the perovskite layer was also confirmed from the AFM results (Fig. S14†). These enhancements can be attributed to the improved wettability and the additional interaction between OBBA and perovskite. To evaluate the optical and crystallographic character of the perovskite films on different ETLs, UV-vis absorption spectra, and XRD patterns were measured, as illustrated in Fig. 3g and h, respectively. The perovskite films modified with OBBA demonstrated improved absorbance due to the improved crystallinity. The corresponding XRD intensity and full width at half maxima (FWHM) of the (001) crystal plane of the perovskite film are illustrated in Fig. 3i, indicating an increase in the crystal quality of the perovskite film, which aligns with the SEM analysis.

Furthermore, mesoporous PSCs with a structure of FTO/c-TiO2/m-TiO2 or OBBA-mTiO2/perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD/Au (as shown in Fig. 4a) were fabricated and investigated systematically to evaluate the effects of OBBA modification on the photovoltaic performance. Fig. 4b displays the photovoltaic parameters of the devices that were based on varying concentrations of OBBA. Table 1 summarizes the essential parameters and corresponding average values for the champion cells of each group. The highest PCE of up to 22.14% was achieved with a concentration of 0.02 mg mL−1, which is significantly higher than that of the pristine sample (19.43%). The enhancement of PCE was primarily attributed to the notable increase of fill factor (FF) from 75.55% to 80.48% and the circuit voltage (VOC) from 1.038 V to 1.103 V. Besides, it should be noted that increasing the thickness of the filter layer typically improves UV filtering efficiency, but an excessively high concentration has a detrimental effect on device performance. Hence, to strike a balance between UV filtering and PCE optimization, the concentration of OBBA was chosen as 0.02 mg mL−1. The general applicability of this strategy was demonstrated through similar PCE enhancements observed in MAPbI3 and FAMAPbIBr3-based PSCs, as illustrated in Fig. S15† and summarized in Table S1.† Furthermore, the hysteresis index decreased from 24.89% to 9.96% (Fig. 4c and Table S2†). Additionally, large active area (1.02 cm2) devices with and without OBBA modification were also fabricated and tested. The results, as depicted in Fig. 4d, showed a similar trend in the modified PSC. The enhancement of photovoltaic performance can be attributed to the optimized interfacial carrier extraction and reduced interface defect density. To evaluate the steady-state output performance of the PSCs in practical applications, a continuous output was measured at the maximum power point (MPP). As shown in Fig. 4e, a higher output with less attenuation was achieved by the the OBBA-modified device in a timescale of 500 s. In addition, the IPCE of corresponding PSCs and integrated current density (JSC) curves calculated therefrom are shown in Fig. 4f. A slight decrease can be observed below 400 nm due to the filter effect of OBBA to UV light, whereas the increase in the long wavelength region can be attributed to the enhancement in carrier collection and crystal quality.32 Therefore, the JSC average value of the modified devices is marginally higher than that of the pristine devices, which is consistent with the J–V measurement results. Meanwhile, the statistical data for photovoltaic parameters collected from 30 individual devices for each group are displayed in Fig. S16.† Obviously, the devices with OBBA not only have a higher PCE but also exhibit better reproducibility in comparison with pristine samples.

Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) was performed to determine the band alignment of the pristine and OBBA-modified devices to explain the mechanism behind the improvements in photovoltaic performance. As shown in Fig. 5a and b, the cutoff binding energy (Ecutoff) and onset binding energy (Eonset) of the pristine and TiO2–OBBA films were obtained using a tangent method, and the valence band maximum (EVBM) and the conduction band minimum (ECBM) were also calculated, as listed in Table S3.† Therefore, an energy-level diagram was constructed for an entire device, as shown in Fig. 5c. The energy barriers between the ETL and perovskite were found to be decreased from 0.08 to 0.05 eV, which is expected to promote charge injection and inhibit nonradiative recombination at the ETL/perovskite interface. The work function (WF) can be calculated by the formula WF = hν − Ecutoff, where hν is the energy of the He I emission line (21.22 eV). As depicted in Fig. S17,† the WF values were determined to be −4.22 and −4.1 eV for the pristine and OBBA-modified TiO2 films, respectively. This upward shift of WF can be attributed to the strong bonding effect between the CO group and TiO2, the CO group with intense negative charge can donate electrons to TiO2.33 To investigate the improvement in energy level alignment and defects passivation, SSPL and TRPL measurements were conducted using a fluorescence photometer, all the PL and PL lifetime results were collected from the ETL side. As illustrated in Fig. 5d and Table S4,† the PL intensity in the OBBA-modified device is lower compared to the pristine device, indicating a reduction in radiative recombination caused by defects and faster carrier extraction thanks to optimized energy level, and a slight blue shift (from 778 to 775 nm) was observed after OBBA modification, which is evidence for the defect passivation according to the literature.34 The magnitude of reduction is consistent with the average value of PL mapping. Moreover, the TRPL decay measurement provides a deep insight into the carrier dynamics, as demonstrated in Fig. 5e, the average PL lifetimes were fitted and the data are summarized in Table S5.† It is evident that the OBBA-modified perovskite film (τave = 364.70 ns) exhibited a lower carrier lifetime than that of the pristine sample (τave = 242.75 ns). These results indicate faster carrier transportation and lower carrier combination at the OBBA–TiO2/perovskite interface, which can be attributed to the optimized energy level distribution and the strong passivation effect of OBBA, which is well consistent with the UPS analysis.35,36 In addition, confocal PL intensity mappings for the pristine and OBBA-modified perovskite films were conducted to reveal the spatial PL homogeneity and internal carrier transportation. As depicted in Fig. 5f and g, the perovskite film based on a modified TiO2 layer exhibited a decreased and uniform PL intensity distribution in comparison to the pristine sample. Corresponding statistics for the PL intensity mapping are given in Fig. S18,† notably, after OBBA modification, the Gaussian distribution of the PL intensity became narrower, and the average value of PL intensity was significantly decreased compared to the pristine group. This enhancement can be attributed to two factors. Firstly, the incorporation of the OBBA layer between the ETL and perovskite introduces a modified interface, which leads to improved energy band alignment. This enhanced energy band alignment facilitates efficient charge transfer and reduces charge accumulation at the interface. Secondly, the OBBA layer can passivate the uncoordinated Pb2+ defects, reducing non-radiative recombination processes. These two factors work together to minimize local variations in charge carrier concentrations and enhance the overall PL intensity uniformity.37

Tremendous defects generated inevitably at grain boundaries and interfaces have played a crucial role in the efficiency and stability of PSCs.38 Therefore, the passivation ability of OBBA molecule is needed to be evaluated systematically. As depicted in the ESP map, the symmetrical molecular structure and intense negative charge distribution are beneficial for increasing the defects' passivation ability and charge transportation, while the two carboxyl groups located at the terminals can effectively coordinate with Pb2+ defects39–41 To further examine the defects passivation effect of OBBA and its interactions with Pb2+ defects, FTIR was conducted. As illustrated in Fig. 6a, a significant redshift (from 1678 to 1666 cm−1) of the CO stretching vibration was observed in the OBBA-perovskite sample, indicating a strong bonding between CO and Pb2+ defects. This bonding can help passivate the undercoordinated Pb2+ defects at the buried interface.42 To further assess the impact of OBBA modification and elucidate the mechanism underlying the observed performance enhancement, space charge limited current (SCLC) analysis was conducted, and the results are presented in Fig. 6b. Generally, the defect density (Nt) can be calculated by the following eqn (6):27 (6)where e stands for the electric charge (1.602 × 1019 C), d is the perovskite film thickness, ε0 represents the vacuum permittivity (8.85 × 1012 F cm−1), and ε denotes the dielectric constant of the perovskite film. The VTFL of the pristine device is 0.36 V, corresponding to an Nt value of 3.11 × 1015 cm−3, while the modified devices exhibited a smaller VTFL of 0.27 V, corresponding to an Nt value of 2.32 × 1015 cm−3. The decreased defect density demonstrated an effective interface passivation of the OBBA molecule. Besides, dark J–V measurements were conducted to validate the decreased density of defects and optimize carrier transportation. As shown in Fig. 6c, the VOC of a single-junction solar cell can be expressed by the diode eqn (7):43 (7)where n is the ideality factor, k represents the Boltzmann constant, T is the absolute temperature, Jdark is denoted as the dark current density, and J0 is related to defect-mediated nonradiative recombination. Comparatively, a lower dark current density can be observed for the modified device, manifesting decreased defect density and suppressed carrier recombination. This result is in line with the SCLC and PL analyses mentioned above. To further understand the enhancement of VOC and reveal the differences in the build-in potentials (Vbi) of the two devices, capacitance–voltage measurements were conducted. The relationship between the capacitance and voltage bias can be determined by the Mott–Schottky eqn (8):44 (8)where A refers to the active area of the device, N is impurity doping density, V represents the applied voltage and the built-in potential at equilibrium is denoted as Vbi, which is determined by the intercept of 1/C2 = 0. As shown in Fig. 6d, the Vbi values for the pristine and the OBBA-modified devices were calculated to be about 0.81 and 0.86 V, respectively. The increased Vbi suggested that an enlarged driving force was formed for the separation of photogenerated carriers, which is favorable for achieving a higher VOC. Besides, N is inversely proportional to the slope value of the linear regime of the plot. The OBBA-modified device exhibited a larger slope value than that of the pristine sample, further confirming that the interfacial carrier extraction was accelerated and charge accumulation was suppressed significantly.44 Therefore, the improved FF and VOC can be attributed to the enhanced built-in potential, suppressed carrier accumulation, and preferable energy-level alignment. EIS was conducted under illumination and dark conditions to understand the enhancement of photovoltaic performance and internal carrier transport behavior. Nyquist plots are shown in Fig. 6e and S19,† and fitted results are given in Table S5.† The values of recombination resistance (Rrec) were measured under the dark condition with a bias of 0.8 V, notably, the Rrec was increased from 20743 to 33578 Ω after modification, which can be ascribed to the suppressed interfacial nonradiative recombination. The series resistance (Rs) and contact resistance (Rct) were obtained under light conditions (AM 1.5G). It is clear that both values of Rs and Rct for the modified device were significantly reduced, which is beneficial to promote electron extraction, as confirmed by PL and SCLC results. Moreover, the dependence of VOC and JSC on the light intensity was recorded and plotted in Fig. 6f and g. In the light-intensity-dependent VOC measurement, the OBBA-modified PSC displayed a lower slope (1.38 kT/q) compared to the pristine device (1.62 kT/q). Such a lower slope suggests a reduction in Shockley–Read–Hall recombination for the OBBA-modified device.45 Additionally, the OBBA-modified device (0.9613) showed a slightly increased α value compared to that of the pristine device (0.9442) in the light-intensity-dependent JSC measurement, indicating a decreased bimolecular recombination after OBBA modification. Combining the analysis of EPR, UV-vis spectra, and XPS of TiO2, a mechanism of OBBA modification and passivation can be drawn. As depicted in Fig. 6h, the high UV-absorbing ability of OBBA allowed it to block the UV irradiation, and the carboxyl group with intense negative charge can bond with Ti3+ defects on the surface of TiO2, thereby reducing the initial density of VO-Ti3+ states and suppressing the interfacial photocatalysis, which ultimately improved the UV resistance of PSCs. Meanwhile, the CO can also bond with Pb2+ defects and reduce the defects density at the buried interface.

The intrinsic instability of PSCs remains a significant hindrance to their practical application. Therefore, the long-term stability of both devices under air ambient (25 °C, 15% RH) is illustrated in Fig. S20;† the OBBA-modified PSC maintained 81% of initial PCE after 1700 h of storage, whereas the pristine device suffered from a rapid decline to only 35% of the initial PCE. For comparison, representative PSCs reported recently based on various UV protection strategies are summarized in Table S7.† It is clear that the OBBA-modified devices exhibited outstanding stability under extreme UV irradiation, especially among TiO2-based PSCs. In short, these results demonstrated that UV irradiation can accelerate the degradation of the perovskite by destroying the inorganic crystal framework and releasing cations, while the OBBA modification can significantly suppress the interfacial photocatalytic reaction and passivate the interfacial defects, therefore, the stability of PSCs under extreme UV irradiation and air ambient was enhanced.
3. Conclusions
In summary, the successful introduction of OBBA significantly suppressed the interfacial photocatalysis of TiO2 ETL in PSCs and passivated the defects at the buried interface. The OBBA molecules can effectively filter UV light and eliminate the oxygen vacancies on the TiO2 surface, thus inhibiting the photocatalytic reaction at the interface of TiO2 and perovskite. Based on the experimental results, a photocatalytic degradation mechanism of perovskite under UV irradiation was also proposed. It was also found that the carboxyl group of OBBA provided a strong binding effect with uncoordinated Pb2+, significantly passivating the interfacial defects. Consequently, PCEs of up to 22.14% and 18.10% were achieved for small (0.12 cm2) and large active area (1.02 cm2) devices, respectively. Notably, the OBBA-modified devices exhibited impressive stability under extreme UV irradiation and air ambient conditions. Thus, the selection of modified molecules discussed in this work can serve as an inspiration for readers to enhance the UV stability of PSCs both from physical (UV light filtering) and chemical (photocatalysis suppression) perspectives.
4. Experimental section
4.1 Fabrication of PSCs device
FTO substrates measuring 19 mm × 19 mm were subjected to sequential cleaning using ultrasonication in a detergent solution, DI water, ethanol, acetone, and isopropyl alcohol for 30 minutes. The substrates were then dried using N2 gas and stored for the next step. After 20 minutes of UV-O3 treatment, a thin titania layer was fabricated by spin-coating titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) (0.1 g in 0.6173 g 1-butanol). Following the formation of the mesoporous TiO2 layer (Dyesol, 30NRD), the substrates were annealed in ambient air at 450 °C for 30 minutes. The OBBA solution (DMF) was spin-coated on a mesoporous TiO2 layer at 3000 rpm for 30 s and annealed at 100 °C for 5 min. For the pristine sample, pure DMF solvent was spin-coated under the same conditions. To fabricate the mixed cation perovskite layer, 142 mg FAI, 27 mg MAI, 412 mg PbI2, 24 mg CsI, and 57 mg PbBr2 were dissolved in 0.6 mL DMF/DMSO (4:1, volume ratio) mixed solvent. A total of 60 μL of precursor solution was dropped onto the UV-ozone-treated substrates in a nitrogen glovebox, and 100 μL of CB was dropped after 15 seconds of the second period as an antisolvent. The substrates were quickly transferred and annealed at 120 °C for 20 minutes. A total of 35 μL of spiro-OMeTAD chlorobenzene solution (72.6 mg spiro-OMeTAD in 1 mL of CB mixed with 29 μL of tBP, 17.5 μL of Li-TFSI) (520 mg mL−1 in acetonitrile), and 29.0 μL of Co(III)-TFSI (300 mg mL−1 in acetonitrile) was spin-coated (3000 rpm for 30 seconds) as the hole transporting layer. Finally, a 90 nm gold electrode was vacuum evaporated.
4.2 Theoretical calculations
The OBBA molecule's ESP and geometry optimization were calculated using the Gaussian program by the density functional theory (DFT). B3LYP was used as the exchange–correlation function, and 6-31G* basis sets were employed, at the gas phase with the default spin mode.
