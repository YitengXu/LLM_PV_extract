    , Accepted 27th January 2020First published on 27th January 2020AbstractThe fine control over the surface of lead sulfide colloidal quantum dots (PbS CQDs) is increasingly important to achieve enhanced device performance. In particular, the in-gap trap state resulting from the surface hydroxylation of PbS CQDs is considered detrimental to photovoltaic performance. In this study, we developed a method to avoid hydroxyl formation on the PbS CQD surface by using an in situ solution-phase ligand-exchange process. The complete elimination of protic solvents and other hydroxyl sources from the CQD synthesis to device fabrication produced PbS CQD films without undesired hydroxyl ligands with a reduced trap density. In this process, the purification process, which accounts for nearly 60% of the synthesis cost, is completely excluded. The presence of trap states verified through optical analysis and the hydroxylation observed via surface analysis clearly agreed with the device characterization obtained by transient photovoltage and photocurrent. Consequently, the open-circuit voltage of the PbS CQD solar cells is improved by up to 10%, yielding a certified power-conversion efficiency of 11.6%.
Introduction
Lead sulfide colloidal quantum dots (PbS CQDs) are attracting attention as next-generation light-harvesting materials owing to their photoelectric tunability and manufacturing flexibility.1–5 To increase the power-conversion efficiency (PCE) of PbS CQD photovoltaics (PVs), it is necessary to control the surface of PbS CQDs precisely and understand the influence of the surface on their physical properties.6–10 Thus far, efforts have mostly been directed toward the control and the understanding of the post-synthesized surface modification for fabricating conductive PbS CQD films. Unexpected hydroxyl (–OH) ligands on the surface of PbS CQDs are considered as a major factor limiting the performance of PbS CQD PVs.11–14 The OH ligands can be attached at any step, from the CQD synthesis to the fabrication or even during the characterization of PVs. Hydroxylation of the (111) facets has proven to create in-gap trap states due to reduced passivation13 and deep level trapping, causing significant open-circuit voltage (VOC) deficits in CQD solar cells thus impeding the efficiency increase.15–17
Recently, the effects of unexpected –OH ligands on the electrical properties of conductive PbS CQD films and the performance of PbS CQD PVs in the solid-state ligand exchange (SSE) process have been reported.9,18 The use of the solution-phase ligand exchange process for reducing unexpected ligand exchange has led to the PCE improvement of PbS CQD PVs.19 Aqoma et al. reported that pre-exchanged CQDs in the solution-phase (CQD-ink) process inhibited the exchange of unexpected –OH ligands while inducing effective exchange of native ligands with iodide atomic ligands compared with the SSE process.11 The CQD-ink process can certainly suppress the defects of the conductive PbS CQD film and yield a higher PCE of PbS CQD PVs.
Nevertheless, the –OH group cannot be completely removed in the device fabrication stages after the synthesis.8,9,13 Thus, it is obvious that we need to carefully monitor the extent of hydroxylation from the material synthesis process. Currently, the most widely used synthetic method for the state-of-the-art performing PbS CQD is based on using lead oleate and hexamethyldisilathiane (TMS2S) as precursors.1,9,20 Compared to many other synthetic procedures reported,21–23 surface chemistry of the PbS CQDs using the precursors herein is very well understood and thus can further be easily modified for efficient photovoltaic devices.3,5 Lead oleate is typically prepared either using lead acetate hydrate (Pb(OAc)2) or lead oxide.12,23–25 Since the synthesis using Pb(OAc)2 and TMS2S results in highly monodisperse PbS CQDs with a reduced amount of –OH ligands on the surface of the CQDs24 when compared to the lead oxide,12,26 we used Pb(OAc)2 as a lead source in this study. The initial synthesis process can be divided into a CQD formation step and an unreacted precursor purification step,27 and the control of unexpected ligands such as –OH at each step is required. Unfortunately, most studies on the initial synthesis process have been limited to the CQD formation step, and the purification step has been neglected.
A precipitation–redispersion (PR) purification method is an essential step to separate CQDs from byproducts and solvents.27–29 However, the PR purification method has several drawbacks. Impurities having similar solubility cannot be separated by purification. Additionally, the specific functional group of the solvent influences the CQD surface chemistry, leading to temporary or permanent damage. In the case of PbS CQDs, washing the synthetic sample with methanol is a critical step, because acetone cannot remove the lead oleate byproduct.30,31 Nevertheless, many researchers have reported that methanol can displace carboxylate ligands from other ligands or detach them from the metal sites of the CQD surface in the purification process, leading to hydroxylation.14,32,33 Thus, the present purification method using methanol cannot prevent –OH formation on the PbS CQD surface. Lastly, the PR purification method requires toxic solvents and an additional centrifuge process in the commercialization of CQD optoelectronic devices. The centrifuging and cleaning steps using methanol and toluene for PbS CQDs account for 59.3% of the synthesis cost and 23.9% of the total manufacturing cost according to a reported study.34
In this study, we systematically investigated the effect of hydroxylation on the surface of CQDs and the performance of PVs during the PR purification process. –OH ligands were excluded during the synthesis, purification, and ligand-exchange steps as much as possible. We found that the number of sub-bandgap states and the amount of surface ligands were significantly affected by the purification step. Photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and transient photovoltage (TPV) analysis were conducted to examine the chemical and electronic structures of CQDs with various purifications. Reduced hydroxylation of the CQD-ink yielded high-performance PVs with a certified PCE of 11.6% saving a lot of effort for the cleaning step.
Results and discussion
We synthesized PbS CQDs capped with oleate ligands using a previously reported method with Pb(OAc)2 modifications.19,25 For the synthesis of the PbS CQDs, Pb(OAc)2 was dissolved in OA and 1-octadecene at 100 °C under vacuum. The reaction was initiated by hot injection of the sulfide precursor, TMS2S, in a nitrogen atmosphere.9 After the synthesis, the crude solution was divided into two batches. One was analyzed and used as is (OH-poor PbS CQD), and the other was purified using acetone and methanol to remove unreacted materials, remove excessive surface ligands, and change the solvent (OH-rich PbS CQD). The detailed process is presented in the Experimental section and Scheme S1 (ESI†). Additionally, for fabricating PbS CQD PVs, the conductivity of the CQD films should be increased by replacing the native OA ligands with short ligands such as iodine atomic ligands. We modified the surface of the OH-poor and OH-rich PbS CQDs following the slightly reformed CQD-ink process19 for the fabrication of conductive PbS CQD films (see Scheme 1 and the Experimental section).
 Scheme 1  CQD-ink process of OH-poor and OH-rich CQDs. 
To investigate the changes in the optical properties due to the purification process, absorption, and photoluminescence (PL) measurements of the OH-rich and OH-poor PbS CQD solutions with various surface modifications were performed. It is well known that the PL intensity represents the amount of trap states and that the absorption indicates the physical size and the uniformity of PbS CQDs.35Fig. 1a and b show the absorption and PL spectra of the OH-poor PbS CQD solution with oleate ligands and the final OH-rich PbS CQD solution with oleate ligands, respectively (refer to Fig. S1 (ESI†) for the absorption and PL spectra after each purification procedure). The peak position in the absorption spectra did not change after the PR purification process, as shown in Fig. 1a. However, the intensity of the PL peaks decreased by 50.7% when the purification was performed, as shown in Fig. 1b. Moreover, the full width at half maximum (FWHM) values of the absorption spectra increased, whereas those of the PL spectra appeared similar (Table S1 (ESI†)). This is because the methanol treatment and surface hydroxylation of the CQDs induced an additional non-radiative in-gap state. Clearly, the purification process generated trap states by partially altering the surface chemistry of the PbS CQDs.

Additionally, the absorption and PL spectra of the conductive PbS CQDs were analysed to observe the effects of the purification process, as shown in Fig. 1c and d. The CQD-ink process was performed directly on both OH-poor and OH-rich PbS CQD solutions (Experimental (ESI†)). Because the byproduct is hydrophobic, only PbS CQDs were transferred from the octane solvent to dimethylformamide solvent without any methanol treatment. The physical size and size distribution of the PbS CQDs capped with iodide ligands were hardly affected by the PR purification process, as shown in Fig. 1c. After surface modification with iodide, the degradation of the PL intensity was maintained, as shown in Fig. 1d. However, because iodide treatment can partially passivate the surface of CQDs, the decrease in the PL intensity of OH-rich PbS CQDs due to the purification process was partially restored to that of OA-capped CQDs (from 49.3% to 77.3% compared with the OH-poor PbS CQDs). The unshifted excitonic peak position and FWHM of the absorption and PL spectra are presented in Table S1 (ESI†).
To investigate the origin of the difference in the PL intensity, we performed XPS on iodide-treated PbS CQD films prepared with and without PR purification. Fig. 2a shows the average stoichiometry of I/Pb based on the integrated area of I 3d and Pb 4f core-level spectra for three samples. After the iodide treatment, the OH-rich PbS CQDs had a smaller amount of iodide ligands on the surface than the OH-poor PbS CQDs. This means that the OH-rich PbS CQDs have more trap states by –OH ligands.13 Further, the Pb/S stoichiometry of the OH-rich CQDs with iodide ligands was similar to that of the OH-poor CQDs, but the amount of oxygen was increased by the PR purification process, as shown in Table S2 (ESI†). Fig. 2b shows the O 1s XPS core-level spectra of iodide-capped PbS CQD films prepared with and without PR purification, which can be deconvoluted into two peaks reflecting two different chemical environments.14 The higher binding peak at 532.6 eV corresponds to the –COO– group from the residual bound OA ligands. The peak at 531.3 eV corresponds to the –OH group, which often results from the reaction with moisture in the synthesis, purification, and/or ligand-exchange process.12,36 The iodide-capped OH-rich PbS CQD films exhibited a large amount of –OH coordination, which shifted the peak of the O 1s XPS core-level spectrum and increased the amount of oxygen compared with OH-poor PbS CQD-ink films, as shown in Fig. 2b and Table S1 (ESI†), respectively.

For further surface analysis, the –OH content was investigated via Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy in the broad range of 3000–3600 cm−1. Fig. 2c confirms that the –OH content was higher with the purification.8 Clearly, the unexpected –OH ligands were retained after ligand exchange and they generated trap states and reduced the intensity of the PL spectra. According to these results, the purification process is unnecessary with regard to defect mitigation.
Additionally, we performed ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) measurements for OH-rich and OH-poor PbS CQD-ink films to examine the effect of the –OH ligands on the band edge alignment. Fig. S2a and b (ESI†) show the ultraviolet photoelectron spectra in the secondary cutoff region and valence band region for OH-rich and OH-poor PbS CQD-ink films. Fig. S2c (ESI†) shows a schematic energy–level diagram based on the UPS spectra. The OH-rich PbS CQD-ink film exhibited a shallower valence band edge because the dipole field of –OH shifted the band alignment to the vacuum energy level, and the OH-poor PbS CQD-ink film with improved passivation of iodide exhibited a deeper energy level.9,37 This agrees well with the results of the various surface analyses.
Finally, PVs with OH-rich and OH-poor PbS CQD-ink films were fabricated on ZnO nanoparticles/indium tin oxide (ITO) glass substrates, as shown in the inset of Fig. 3a and the cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image in Fig. S3 (ESI†). Fig. 3a and b show the current density–voltage characteristics and the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the best PV device among the PbS CQD-ink films. Table 1 presents the best, certified, and average PV performance metrics, including the VOC, short-circuit current density (JSC), fill factor (FF), and PCE. A statistical analysis of the PV performance metrics was conducted for each of the 12 CQD PV devices with OH-rich and OH-poor CQD-ink films listed in Table 1. While the differences in the JSC and FF were not large (up to 1%), the VOC and maximum power point voltage (VMPP) were significantly improved from 0.616 to 0.678 V and from 0.449 to 0.539 V, respectively, for the best-performing PV device with a OH-poor CQD-ink film. This voltage difference is consistent with the analysis results for the optical properties and surface chemistry. The PCE of the CQD PVs was improved by 8.5% (from 11.38% to 12.35% for the best device) by simply omitting the purification process. Fig. S4 (ESI†) shows the certificates (from Newport) for the PV performance metrics of the OH-rich and OH-poor CQD-ink films.

The performance enhancement of the OH-poor CQD-ink film-based PVs was mainly due to the improvement of the VOC compared with the OH-rich CQD-ink film-based PVs. Thus, to gain more insight into the improvement of the VOC, the charge-recombination lifetime of the PVs was investigated via TPV analysis, as shown in Fig. 4a. The photovoltage decay constants for OH-rich and OH-poor CQD-ink film-based PVs examined at 0.449 and 0.539 V near the VMPP were 20.9 and 31.8 μs, respectively. This enhanced lifetime indicates the elimination of trap states in the PbS CQD PVs.14,33,38

Color dots and lines indicate PbS CQD-ink films with purification (black) and without purification (red). 
For further charge-recombination analysis, we monitored the VOCversus JSC for various illumination intensities.17,39 The slope of VOCversus JSC can be expressed as nkBT/q, where n, kB, T, and q represent the diode ideality factor, Boltzmann constant, temperature in Kelvin, and elementary charge, respectively. The diode ideality factor indicates the dominant recombination mechanism.17,39 When n is close to unity, band-to-band recombination is dominant. However, when n is close to 2, the trap-assisted recombination mechanism is dominant. The slope of VOCversus JSC for the OH-poor PbS CQD-ink film-based PVs was significantly smaller (1.65 nkBT/q) than that for the OH-poor PbS CQD-ink film-based PVs (1.97 nkBT/q), as shown in Fig. 4b.40 The decrease in the diode ideality factor suggests the reduction of the trap-assisted recombination in the OH-poor PbS CQD-ink films, which resulted in fewer trap states and an improved VOC compared with the OH-rich PbS CQD-ink films.
We posit that the improved performance and VOC of the CQD-ink devices were due to the mitigation of trap states by suppressed hydroxylation. The trap density in the PbS CQD PVs was investigated using TPV analysis combined with transient photocurrent (TPC) spectroscopy.8,11,41Fig. 4c shows the measured density of states (DOS) with respect to the VOC. The OH-poor PbS CQD-ink film-based PVs exhibited significantly lower DOS values than the OH-rich PbS CQD-ink film-based PVs. The DOS below the VMPP for the OH-poor PbS CQD-ink films (2.28 × 1015 cm−3 at 0.539 V) was one order of magnitude higher than that for the OH-rich PbS CQD-ink films (2.46 × 1016 cm−3 at 0.449 V), in accordance with the TPV/TPC analysis results (see the Experimental section for the detailed DOS calculation procedures). These results indicate that the midgap of the OH-poor PbS CQD-ink film-based PVs was cleaner than that of the OH-rich PbS CQD-ink film-based PVs. Therefore, producing PbS CQD-inks without the PR purification process significantly improves the VOC and ultimately the PCE of PbS CQD PVs by minimizing the undesirable hydroxyl formation.
Conclusions
In summary, we found that the PR purification process in synthesis has crucial effects on the surface chemistry and optoelectronic properties of PbS CQDs. The purified PbS CQD films contain undesirable hydroxyl ligands that can create excessive uncontrolled trap states. The optical UV-visible absorption and PL study unveil the effect of purification steps with the protic solvent on the trap states of PbS CQDs. TPV and TPC investigations confirm how these trap states originated from hydroxylation limit the PV performance. By using a OH-poor CQD-ink process in this study, we modified the CQD surface with iodide atomic ligands by inhibiting the formation of undesirable hydroxyl ligands in the CQD films and achieved a certified PCE of 11.6% without a complicated methanol treatment process.
