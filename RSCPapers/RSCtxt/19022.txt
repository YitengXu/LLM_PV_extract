    , Accepted 25th October 2020First published on 27th October 2020AbstractVertical-structure photodetectors usually have the advantages of fast response speed and low driving voltage, but suffer from the high dark current that suppresses the detectivity of the devices. Introducing hole/electron-transporting or blocking layers has thus been widely considered to reduce the dark current, but may simultaneously cause the undesirable loss of photocurrent. Herein, we apply photo-switchable electron-transporting layers into vertical-structure photodetectors, which effectively reduces the dark current without sacrificing photocurrent for achieving the high detectivity. Organic dye molecules, perylene bisimides (PBI-H), are doped into the matrix of zinc oxide (ZnO) to achieve the photo-switchable layer (ZnO:PBI-H), which is less conductive in the dark for the inserted low-conductivity organic molecules but highly conductive under light irradiation due to the photo-induced electron transfer from PBI-H to ZnO. Perovskite is used as the photoactive layer in the photodetectors, and a thin layer of polyethylenimine ethoxylated (PEIE) is inserted between the ZnO:PBI-H layer and the perovskite layer in order to inhibit the decomposition of perovskite caused by ZnO. The optimized photodetector based on a ZnO:PBI-H electron-transporting layer shows the highest detectivity up to 2.5 × 1013 cm Hz1/2 W−1 (Jones) at zero bias (light intensity of 126 μW cm−2), which is more than doubled when compared with the device based on ZnO. In addition, the photoresponse stability of the device is also improved by the photo-switchable layer. The primary result sheds new light on the great potential of photo-switchable materials for the development of high-performance photodetectors.
Introduction
Photodetectors with high sensitivity and fast response speed are highly desirable for optical sensing applications, such as fast imaging, high-speed optical communication and monitoring of ultrafast dynamic processes.1,2 In comparison to lateral-structure photodetectors with a large electrode spacing (>5 μm) driven by high voltage, it is undoubtedly more promising to develop vertical-structure devices with a small electrode spacing (<0.5 μm) which thus can be driven at low voltage and even self-driven by the photovoltaic effect.3–5 Importantly, vertical-structure photodetectors exhibit faster response speed attributed to the shorter charge carrier transit length.6–8 However, due to the small electrode spacing, the dark current density of vertical-structure photodetectors is high, resulting in large shot noise and low detectivity.
The interfacial engineering in vertical-structure photodetectors has been widely considered to decrease the dark current.9 For instance, Dou and co-workers employed poly[(9,9-bis(3′-(N,N-dimethylamino)propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene)] (PFN) as the hole blocking layer in CH3NH3PbI3−xClx photodetectors that revealed a significantly reduced dark current and a very high detectivity of 8 × 1013 Jones.10 Fang and co-workers replaced poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) with N4,N4′-bis(4-(6-((3-ethyloxetan-3-yl)methoxy)hexyl)phenyl)-N4,N4′-diphenylbiphenyl-4,4′-diamine (OTPD) as the hole-transporting layer, along with increasing the thickness of electron-transporting layer to decrease the dark current of photodetectors, resulting in an enhanced detectivity up to 7.4 × 1012 Jones.11 Similar strategies were also developed to reduce the dark current including using several electron-transporting layers,12 increasing the thickness of the photoactive layer13,14 or applying composite hole-transporting layer.15 However, by these strategies of thickened layers, undesirable loss of photocurrent may be caused, which may further bring the adverse consequences of responsivity and detectivity in photodetectors. In order to achieve the high detectivity, the ideal interlayer in photodetectors should restrain dark current as well as enhance the photocurrent.
In our previous works, we have developed a kind of photoconductive materials by doping a small amount of organic dye molecules, i.e. perylene bisimide (PBI), into the matrix of zinc oxide (ZnO), a classic electron transporting material, and demonstrated its successful application in organic solar cells as well as polymeric light emitting diodes.16–18 The photo-induced electron transfer from the PBI dye molecules to the conduction band of ZnO was regarded as the essential mechanism to achieve the high conductivity of such hybrid materials under light irradiation. According to the working mechanism of such hybrid, it could be a proper candidate as electron-transporting layer for vertical-structure photodetectors.19
Herein, we demonstrate the application of photo-switchable electron-transporting layers of ZnO:PBI-H in CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3) perovskite based photodetectors (Fig. 1), which showed decreased dark current when compared with the devices with ZnO as the electron-transporting layers. By taking advantage of photo-switchable electron-transporting layer, our optimized perovskite photodetector showed a high detectivity of 2.5 × 1013 cm Hz1/2 W−1 (Jones) at zero bias (light intensity of 126 μW cm−2), without sacrificing the responsivity and response speed. In addition, the photoresponse stability of device was also improved by the photo-switchable layer. The present work indicates that photo-switchable materials hold the huge possibility for developing high-performance photodetectors.

Results and discussion
In this work, we fabricated Device A and Device B with ZnO and ZnO:PBI-H as electron-transporting layer, respectively, to investigate the function of photo-switchable materials in improving the detectivity of perovskite based photodetectors. The structure of the devices was ITO/ZnO or ZnO:PBI-H/PEIE/MAPbI3/Spiro-OMeTAD/MoO3/Ag, which is similar to perovskite solar cells with n–i–p structure.20 As shown in Fig. S1d (ESI†), the absorption of ZnO:PBI-H was slightly enhanced in the range of 400–610 nm relating to PBI-H, and the conduction band minimum (CBM) of ZnO:PBI-H was calculated to be −3.97 eV via ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) which was appropriate for electrons transportation (the detailed calculation was given in the Supporting Information). The perovskite MAPbI3 layer was about 300 nm thick so that could absorb light efficiently ranging from 300 to 800 nm as shown in Fig. S1 and S2 (ESI†). ITO was chosen as the transparent electrode, and spiro-OMeTAD worked as the classic hole-transporting layer of perovskite solar cells.21–23 A thin layer of PEIE was inserted between ZnO (or ZnO:PBI-H) and MAPbI3 in order to isolate these two layers. Around 10 nm thick MoO3 was deposited by vacuum thermal evaporation on top of spiro-OMeTAD that could block electrons to reduce recombination, and sequentially 100 nm thick Ag was deposited as top electrode. Detailed device fabrication procedures are supplied in the experimental section.
Although ZnO and perovskite layers have been proved to work in optoelectronic devices, the perovskite has been testified decomposed on ZnO modified substrates. Thus, a thin layer of PEIE was adopted on ZnO (or ZnO:PBI-H) to avoid MAPbI3 from decomposing. PEIE as a common cathode modifying material is usually controlled to form a thin layer in devices due to its intrinsic low conductivity.24 To figure out the proper thickness of PEIE layer that can avoid the decomposition of perovskite without sacrificing the photocurrent, we fabricated perovskite photodetectors by using a series of concentration of PEIE precursor solution varied from 0.1 wt% to 0.5 wt%. As shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†), the PEIE layer played an important role in inhibiting the decomposition of perovskite on ZnO or ZnO:PBI-H. But if the PEIE layer was too thin (i.e. from the 0.1 wt% PEIE solution), the ZnO (or ZnO:PBI-H) and perovskite layers could not be separated efficiently (Fig. S3, ESI†) which caused poor crystallization of perovskite as shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†). When the PEIE layer was too thick, it would suppress the photocurrent of the device caused by the poor conductivity of PEIE (Fig. S6 and Table S1, ESI†). Moreover, the high concentration to make the thick PEIE layer resulted in modest photocurrent density as shown in Fig. S7 (ESI†). The detailed information on these optimization processes was given in the ESI.† Thus, in the following sections, we fabricated all the devices based on this optimized thickness of PEIE (∼ 4 nm), i.e. from 0.2 wt% PEIE solution.25 The morphology of ITO/ZnO (or ZnO:PBI-H)/PEIE became polymer-like which was quite different from ITO/ZnO (or ZnO:PBI-H) as the concentration of PEIE increases implying the evident coverage of PEIE layer as shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†).
The detectivity (D*) as a key figure-of-merit parameter characterizes the ability of a photodetector to detect weak optical signals, which is calculated by .26 Here Rre is the responsivity, A is the effect area of the photodetector (0.05 cm2), Δf is the electrical bandwidth and in is the noise current. Generally, dark current which determines the shot noise is considered as the main source of noise signal, so that detectivity can be simply calculated as follows by eqn (1):6,27 (1)where e is the elementary charge and Jd is the dark current density. From above equation, it can be seen that achieving a small dark current will benefit for the detectivity improvement. As shown in Fig. 2a, the detectivity of ZnO:PBI-H based device (Device B) is 2.5 × 1013 Jones at 670 nm and generally higher than 1013 Jones in the broad spectral range from 370 to 770 nm which is doubled than ZnO based device (Device A). We assume that the pronounced improvement of detectivity is related to the photo-switchable layer combined with optimized PEIE layer contributing to a lower dark current while remaining a high photocurrent.
 Fig. 2  (a) The detectivity, (b) responsivity, and (c) dark current density of Device A (black square) and Device B (red circle). The detectivity and responsivity were measured at zero bias. 
The responsivity of photodetectors defined as the ratio of photocurrent to incident-light intensity, which is calculated as follows by eqn (2):28 (2)where iph is the photocurrent, PS is the incident optical intensity, IPCE is monochromatic incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency, λ is optical wavelength, h is the Planck's constant and c is the light speed. As shown in Fig. 2b, the highest responsivity of perovskite photodetectors are 0.34 A W−1 and 0.35 A W−1 at 670 nm for Device A and Device B, respectively. The nearly same responsivity data is derived from the very close photocurrent in both devices as shown in Fig. S6 and Table S1 (ESI†) which is similar to ZnO based perovskite solar cells.29 The comparison of dark current density of Devices A and B is shown in Fig. 2c. It can be seen that the evident decrease in dark current results in the high detectivity of Device B.
To explore the functions of the photo-switchable layer of ZnO:PBI-H on the modulation of dark current and photocurrent in perovskite photodetectors, we fabricated simple sandwich-like diodes with ZnO or ZnO:PBI-H as the active layer between ITO and aluminum (Al) electrodes as shown in Fig. 3. From the current–voltage curves, the dark current of ZnO:PBI-H based device is obviously lower than that of ZnO based one, which agrees with the results of perovskite photodetectors in Fig. 2c. For their photocurrent characteristics, ZnO:PBI-H indeed exhibits a slight enhancement on photoconductivity compared to pristine ZnO, which is caused by the charge transfer between ZnO and PBI-H as reported before.16,19,30

We further fabricated field-effect transistors (FETs) to investigate how the conductivity of ZnO:PBI-H changes in the dark and under illumination. The conductivity was related to the mobility as well as the concentration of charge carriers, both of which could be well investigated in FETs, although electron transportation in such devices was different from that in the diodes. As shown in Fig. S8 (ESI†), the threshold voltage (Vth) of ZnO:PBI-H based FET shifts negatively when illuminated under simulate sunlight (100 mW cm−2), which corresponds to the photovoltaic operation mode in FET, confirming the charge transfer between ZnO and PBI-H.31 At the source–drain voltage (VD) equals to 20 V, the mobility can be calculated as shown in Table 1 (the calculation details are given in the ESI†). The mobility of ZnO:PBI-H in the dark is about one order of magnitude lower than pristine ZnO, along with the similar charge carrier concentration (Fig. S9, ESI†), which means the conductivity of ZnO:PBI-H could be fairly low. Under illumination, the mobility of ZnO:PBI-H is slightly increased owing to the fulfill of trap states by photo-induced electron transfer, but it is still lower than that of ZnO. Thus, the high photoconductivity in ZnO:PBI-H was mainly attributed to the increased charge carrier concentration (Fig. S9, ESI†).

To further evaluate the current response of perovskite photodetectors, the linear dynamic range (LDR) was carried out, which depends on the illumination intensity range within which the current response of the photodetector scales linearly with the light intensity. For the Device B, the photocurrent density and responsivity as the function of the incident light intensity are shown in Fig. 4. Then, its LDR can be calculated to reach 112 decibels (dB) at zero bias by following eqn (3):32 (3)where Jupper/Jlower and Lupper/Llower define the maximum/minimum photocurrent density and light intensity of the photodetector in the linear response range, respectively. The large LDR of Device B indicates that both weak and strong optical signals can be accurately detected. As can be seen, the photocurrent is quite in accordance with linearity under monochromatic 532 nm laser with light intensity ranging from 1.1 × 10−7 to 4.4 × 10−2 W cm−2 and the responsivity in the whole light intensity range keeps nearly constant, which means the photogenerated charge carriers could be transferred effectively with the extremely low recombination losses.
 Fig. 4  The LDR and responsivity of Device B measured at zero bias under monochromatic 532 nm laser with various light intensity. 
Response speed, which is another key performance parameter of photodetector, defines the ability of photodetector to follow a fast-changing light signal. As shown in Fig. 5, the response speed of Device A and Device B were measured at zero bias under the illumination of 532 nm laser modulated at the frequency of 10 kHz. The rise time (tr, defined as the time when the photocurrent rises from 10% to 90% of the maximum photocurrent) of Device A and Device B is 1.6 and 2.4 μs, respectively. The fall time (tf, defined as the time when the photocurrent decays from 90% to 10% of the maximum photocurrent) of above devices corresponds to 5.9 and 27.8 μs, respectively. It is noted that there is a significant difference of the conductivity for ZnO and ZnO:PBI-H in the dark (Fig. 3). The longer fall time of Device B in comparison to Device A may be caused by the low conductivity of ZnO:PBI-H when the laser turns off. Besides, the extra charge carries generated in the ZnO:PBI-H layer need more time to decay (Fig. S10, ESI† for a clear observation).
 Fig. 5  The response speed of (a) Device A and (b) Device B measured at zero bias under the illumination of 532 nm laser modulated at the frequency of 10 kHz (square wave, 50% duty ratio); (c) the frequency response of Device A and Device B measured at zero bias under the illumination of 532 nm laser modulated at various frequency. 
We further measured the frequency response of perovskite photodetectors as shown in Fig. 5c. As the modulated frequency of 532 nm laser increases, the photocurrent of perovskite photodetectors decreases. The cut-off frequency (f3dB) data of both Device A and Device B are about 23 kHz because of their similar rise time. The cut-off frequency is related to both carrier transit time and RC (resistance–capacitance) time constant.14 To further figure out the response speed is limited by charge transfer or RC time constant, we fabricated perovskite photodetectors with different active areas of 0.05, 0.1 and 0.16 cm2, respectively. The active area decides the capacitance of device, in other words, RC time constant. The transient current response of perovskite photodetectors with different active areas is shown in Fig. S11 (ESI†). It can be seen that the waveform changes from approximate square to triangle with the increase of the active area, indicating that the response speed becomes evidently slow. Thus, the response speed is mainly limited by RC time constant of photodetectors, which means that charge carriers can be well transferred by the interfacial layers of ZnO:PBI-H and spiro-OMeTAD.10
The stability of MAPbI3 applied to optoelectronic devices has been much concerned.33–35 Here, the stability test of perovskite photodetectors with encapsulation was operated in air (above 80% RH). As shown in Fig. 6, the responsivity of Device B with encapsulation still maintains 86% of the initial value after 10-days storage, but Device A exhibits worse stability that the responsivity is only 72% of the initial value under the same conditions. The dark current of both devices seems almost no change. The improved photoresponse stability of Device B may be caused by doping PBI-H into ZnO to inhibit the decomposition of MAPbI3 as illustrated in Fig. S3 (ESI†). Herein, our perovskite photodetector with the photo-switchable layer presents the excellent comprehensive performance including high detectivity, large LDR, fast response, and so on, which produces one of the best results reported thus far for self-driven perovskite photodetectors (Table 2).

Conclusions
In summary, we fabricated vertical-structure self-driven perovskite photodetectors with the photo-switchable layer to achieve the high detectivity. Different from using charge carrier transporting or blocking layers or increasing their thickness that may cause the undesirable loss of photocurrent as reported before, it is the first time to adopt the photo-switchable layer of ZnO:PBI-H in perovskite photodetectors to decrease the dark current as well as to enhance the electron transfer under light irradiation, combined with a PEIE layer to inhibit the decomposition of MAPbI3 as photoactive layer. Our optimized perovskite photodetector shows high responsivity of 0.35 A W−1, high detectivity of 2.5 × 1013 Jones (at light intensity of 126 μW cm−2), large LDR of 112 dB, and fast frequency response of around 23 kHz. Moreover, doping PBI-H into ZnO can benefit for the device stability improvement. The high-detectivity perovskite photodetectors with the self-driven feature and the simple structure can handle multiple application scenarios, which has great potential for low-cost fabrication and commercialization. And the strategy suggested in this work may pave an effective way to utilize photo-switchable materials as primary charge carrier transporting layer to develop high-performance photodetectors.
Experimental section
Materials
Spiro-OMeTAD, lead iodine (PbI2), and tris(2-(1H-pyrazol-1-yl)-4-tert-butylpyridine)-cobalt(III)tris(bis-(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide) (FK209) were purchased from Xi’an Polymer Light Technology Corp., methylammonium iodide (MAI), 2-methoxyethanol and γ-butyrolactone (GBL) were purchased from TCI, chlorobenzene (CB), acetonitrile, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), 4-tert-butylpyridine (4-tBP), PEIE, and bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide lithium salt (Li-TFSI), zinc acetate dihydrate (Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. The PBI-H was synthesized via the method from literature.44 All the chemicals were used without further purification.
Device fabrication
ITO glass substrates were cleaned by sequential ultrasonic treatment with deionized water, acetone, and isopropyl alcohol. The substrates were exposed to ultra violet-ozone (Novascan, PSDP-UV8) for 15 min before usage. The sol–gel derived ZnO precursor was prepared by dissolving Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O in 2-methoxyethanol. Sol–gel derived ZnO films were prepared onto the ITO substrate by spin-coating followed by thermal treatment at 200 °C for 60 min. The films of ZnO:PBI-H were derived by directly dissolving PBI-H into the precursor solution of ZnO (Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O:PBI-H = 100:1 wt/wt), and the films were also treated under the same conditions as for ZnO films. Dilute PEIE with 2-methoxyethanol to 0.1–0.5 wt%, and the diluted solution was spin-coated on treated substrates at 5000 rpm for 50 s, followed by annealing at 110 °C for 10 min. After that, the substrates were transferred to a nitrogen glovebox to deposit perovskite on it. The perovskite precursor solution was prepared by mixing 1.2 mol mL−1 MAI and PbI2 in the mixed solvent of GBL and DMSO (1:1 v/v). The perovskite precursor solution was spin-coated on PEIE at 1000 rpm for 10 s and 5000 rpm for 60 s. During the second step, 200 μL CB was poured on the substrates, followed by annealing at 100 °C for 20 min. For deposition of spiro-OMeTAD, 60 mg of spiro-OMeTAD, 13.5 μL Li-TFSI (520 mg mL−1 in acetonitrile), 23.9 μL 4-tBP, and 19 μL FK209 (300 mg mL−1 in acetonitrile) were dissolved in 1 mL CB. The spiro-OMeTAD was deposited on perovskite at 4000 rpm for 30 s without annealing. Finally, 10 nm MoO3 and 100 nm Ag were sequentially deposited on spiro-OMeTAD by vacuum evaporation.
The device structures of ZnO or ZnO:PBI-H diodes are ITO/ZnO (or ZnO:PBI-H)/Al. The ZnO and ZnO:PBI-H films were fabricated by the same method as above. To avoid short circuit, the thickness of films was kept to about 140 nm. Finally, 100 nm Al was deposited on ZnO or ZnO:PBI-H by vacuum evaporation.
ZnO or ZnO:PBI-H based FETs were fabricated in a bottom-gate top-contact structure. ZnO or ZnO:PBI-H films were spin-coated by the same method as above directly on highly n-doped silicon wafers with 300 nm thick thermally grown silicon dioxide layer which were used as the gate electrode and dielectric layer, respectively. After annealing, 100 nm Ag was deposited by vacuum evaporation as electrode with channel width of 1 mm and channel length of 50 μm.
Characterization
The atomic force microscopy (AFM) image was measured by an atomic force microscope (Bruker, MultiMode 8). The absorption spectra were measured by UV-Vis-NIR spectrophotometer (SHIMADZU, UV-3600), and the photoluminescence spectra were measured by exciting at 580 nm with spectrofluorophotometer (SHIMADZU, RF-5301PC). The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was measured by field emission scanning electron microscope (JEOL, JSM 7900F). The UPS was measured by ThermoFisher ESCALAB XI+. The dark current was measured by the Keithley 2400 source-meter (Tektronix). The IPCE was measured by IPCE measurement system (QE-R, Enlitech). The response speed not specified was measured by illuminating the photodetector with a 532 nm laser modulated by an arbitrary function generator (GW INSTEK, AFG-2225) at 10 kHz without bias and the signal was collected by a digital phosphor oscilloscope (Tektronix, TDS 3052C). The cut-off frequency was measured in a similar way to test response speed, except that the laser was modulated at different frequency. The LDR was measured by illuminating the photodetector with a 532 nm laser that was decayed by optical attenuator to get different intensities. The signal was calibrated by power meter (OPHIR Photonics, PD300-UV) and photocurrent of photodetector was recorded by Keithley 2400 source-meter.
