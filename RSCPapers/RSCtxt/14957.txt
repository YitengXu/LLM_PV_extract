To investigate the influence of linker molecules on the electron transfer rate at the QD–linker–TiO2 interface and the final performance of the resultant QDSCs, colloidal QDs capped with thioglycolic acid (TGA), 3-mercaptopropionic acid (MPA), and cysteine (Cys), which also serve as molecular linkers between QDs and TiO2 nanoparticles, were self-assembled on a TiO2 mesoporous film electrode from the corresponding QD aqueous dispersions. The influence of the studied linker molecules (TGA, MPA, and Cys) on the loading amount of QD sensitizer on the TiO2 mesoporous film, the electron injection rate from QDs to the TiO2 matrix, the incident photon to charge carrier generation efficiency (IPCE), and the corresponding photovoltaic performance of the resultant QDSCs were systematically studied. CdSe and CdSexTe1−x QD sensitized solar cells were selected as a model cell to evaluate the influence of the adopted linker molecules. Under AM 1.5G full one sun intensity illumination, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of TGA-capped QDs (5.40% for CdSe, and 6.68% for CdSexTe1−x) was 7–14% greater than those of MPA- and Cys-capped QDs. Similarly, the absorbed photon-to-current efficiency was 8–13% greater. These differences arise from linker molecule-dependent variations of the electron-injection rate. Transient grating measurements indicate that the electron injection rate constant from TGA-capped CdSe (8.0 × 109 s−1) was greater than from MPA- and Cys-capped CdSe (2.6–2.9 × 109 s−1). Thus, TGA-capped QDs are readily attached to the TiO2 substrate and exhibit better electronic properties and desirable electron-transfer rate, and therefore bring forward better photovoltaic performance in the resultant solar cells.
1. Introduction
Quantum dot sensitized solar cells (QDSCs) constitute one of the most promising low cost candidates for third-generation photovoltaic cells due to the various advantages of QD sensitizers in comparison with conventional molecular dye sensitizers, such as the possibility of multiexciton generation (MEG), low-cost and ease of preparation, high molar extinction coefficient, size and composition tunable band gap, large intrinsic dipole moment, etc.1–4 However, at present, the reported best power conversion efficiency of liquid-junction QDSCs (6–7%)5–8 lags far behind their analogue dye sensitized solar cells (DSCs, up to 12%).9 Partial reasons for this poor performance of QDSCs could be ascribed to the slow electron injection rate from QDs to the oxide matrix, since it is one of the most important criteria determining the cell photovoltaic performance.10,11
It is well recognized that the rate of electron injection from QDs to the wide band gap metal oxide (mainly TiO2, ZnO, or SnO2) matrix/conductor is directly related to the way the QD sensitizers are tethered on the metal oxide. Usually, two general approaches have been developed for tethering QDs onto metal oxide electrodes: (i) direct growth of QDs on oxides by chemical bath deposition (CBD), or successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) technique;8,12–21 (ii) post-synthesis assembly using pre-synthesized colloidal QDs via direct adsorption, linker assisted assembly, or electrophoretic deposition (EPD) route.5–7,22–30 In the first approach, the QD sensitizer (electron donor) contacts directly with the oxide matrix (electron acceptor), therefore favoring the excited electron injection from QDs into the oxide matrix. While the surface passivation of QDs is difficult to control in this approach, the accompanied high density trap defect states together with the bare surface of QDs create significant recombination centers, which would detrimentally affect the photovoltaic performance of the resulting cell devices.10,11 These drawbacks can be effectively avoided by the second approach using pre-prepared colloidal QDs, since the size, size distribution, shape, and surface functionalization, and consequently, the band gap alignment and optoelectronic properties, the density and energy of their trap states of colloidal QDs can be easily tailored and well controlled via the well-developed organometallic high temperature synthetic method.10,11,31–33 More importantly, the existing bottleneck for the post-synthesis assembly approach, low loading of QD sensitizers on the oxide matrix, has been effectively overcome by our recently developed ex situ ligand exchange self-assembly route with the use of 3-mercaptopropionic acid (MPA) capped water-soluble QDs.5–7,34,35 In this route a series of high-quality colloidal QDs have been immobilized uniformly throughout the photoanode film thickness with up to 34% coverage.35 More importantly, PCEs of 5.32–7.04% have been obtained for these resultant QDSCs through the use of this general deposition technique.5–7,34,35
Although our previous research has demonstrated that MPA-capped QDs can be effectively tethered on a TiO2 film electrode with high loading and effective electron injection from QDs to TiO2,5–7,34,35 there is no systematic study on the influence of different linker molecules on the electron injection rate and the accompanied photovoltaic performance of the resultant cell devices. Our investigation of the effect of different linker molecules was motivated by the recent theoretical and experimental results, which provide compelling evidence that the nature and especially the linker molecule chain length can significantly influence the electron injection rate and the performance of QDSCs.22,26,31,32,36–45 According to Marcus theory, the electron transfer rate is related directly to the electronic coupling strength, which is expected to decay exponentially with increasing separation between the donor and acceptor.46 This assumption has been verified by experimental results that both the electron injection rate and accompanied photovoltaic performance decreased dramatically with increasing alkyl chain length in mercaptoalkonic acid (MAA) linker molecules.26,36,42,45 Mora-Seró et al. reported that the cell efficiency with the use of the thioglycolic acid (TGA) linker is higher (about double) compared to that of MPA and the corresponding reason was ascribed to the reduced tunnelling probability in MPA due to the longer separation distance, leading to the observed decrease of electron injection.26 Watson and coworkers have characterized electron injection from CdS QDs to TiO2 nanoparticles as a function of the interparticle separation within molecularly linked assemblies and demonstrated that the electron injection yield decreased with increasing MAA chain length and interparticle separation.36 In the practical QDSC system, Kamat and co-workers reported that MPA is a better linker than TGA or mercaptohexadecanoic acid.22 In a similar way, several groups observed that cysteine (Cys) as a linker gives rise to more efficient photoanodes than using TGA or MPA.26,40,44 It seems that there is slight confusion on the determination of optimum linker molecules. It should be highlighted that in most of the above mentioned linker-assisted post-synthesis assembly routes for tethering QD sensitizers on the oxide matrix, it was achieved by an in situ ligand exchange process, where TiO2 films are first functionalized by the linker molecules followed by exposure to QD dispersions for QD assembly. However this deposition route encounters problems with low QD coverage, aggregation of QDs, and poor reproducibility, and the resultant QDSCs show a relatively poor PCE (usually <2%).10,11,31–33 Furthermore, most of the above mentioned transient kinetics investigations were limited to the nanosecond time resolution but not to the picosecond time resolution,36,37,40,41 which is impossible to probe electron transfer on an ultrafast time scale, the region that showcases the majority of temporal transient dynamics.
In this work, we focus on the investigation of the photovoltaic performance of QDSCs constructed by different linker molecule assisted assembly. For this purpose, we have analyzed CdSe, CdSexTe1−x based QDSCs, choosing the most commonly used phase transfer agents with structural similarity as shown in Fig. 1, i.e. TGA, MPA, and Cys as the linker molecules. We investigated the influence of the studied linker molecules on the loading amount of QD sensitizer on a TiO2 film and the electron injection rate from QDs to the TiO2 matrix, and the accompanied incident photon to charge carrier generation efficiency (IPCE) and photovoltaic performance of the resulting cell devices. CdSe and CdSexTe1−x QD sensitized solar cells were selected as model cells to evaluate the influence of the adopted linker molecules. The model QDSCs were constructed by our developed ex situ ligand exchange post-synthesis assembly technique via self-assembly of the corresponding linker molecule capped water-soluble QDs on a TiO2 electrode. We focus on the relationship between linker molecules (ultrafast kinetics) and the ultimate photovoltaic performance of a complete device. We have applied a recently developed improved transient grating (TG) technique to investigate the ultrafast carrier dynamics (on the picosecond time scale) of photogenerated electron injection from QDs to the TiO2 substrate. Experimental results indicate that the electron injection rate from TGA-CdSe to TiO2 is faster than those from MPA- or Cys-QDs. Correspondingly, TGA-QD shows the best photovoltaic performance of 5.40% (for the CdSe cell) and 6.68% (for the CdSexTe1−x cell) under full 1 sun illumination, respectively, which are among the best results in the studied QD sensitizer based QDSCs.

2. Experimental section
Chemicals
Oleic acid (90%), 3-mercaptopropionic acid (MPA, 98%), cysteine (Cys, 97%), and thioglycolic acid (TGA, 97%) were obtained from Alfa Aesar. 1-Octadecene (ODE, 90%), trioctylphosphine (TOP, 90%), selenium powder (200 mesh, 99.99%), cadmium oxide (CdO, 99.99%), tellurium powder (200 mesh, 99.99%), and oleylamine (OAm, 95%) were purchased from Aldrich. All reagents were used as received without any further purification.
Synthesis of CdSe QDs and CdSexTe1−x alloy QDs
The initial oil-soluble OAm-capped CdSe QDs with a particle size of 5.4 ± 0.4 nm as determined by TEM measurements and the first excitonic absorption peak at 620 nm were prepared via the organic phase high temperature route according to a literature method with minor modifications.47 Typically, 0.4 mL of 1.0 M Se stock solution in TOP was mixed with 10.0 mL OAm, and the mixture was heated to 300 °C under N2 flow with stirring. Then, 1.0 mL of 0.4 M Cd stock solution, prepared by dissolving CdO in oleic acid and ODE (v/v, 1:1) at 250 °C, was injected, and the reaction mixture was kept at 280 °C for 10 min. The obtained CdSe QDs were purified by centrifugation and decantation with the addition of methanol.
The preparation of CdSexTe1−x alloyed QDs with a particle size of 5.2 ± 0.4 nm as determined by TEM measurements and absorption edge at 800 nm was according to a literature method by directly heating the reaction mixture containing Cd, Se, and Te precursors from room temperature to a certain high temperature.48 Briefly, 0.1 M Te and Se stock solutions (obtained by dissolving Se or Te powder in TOP and paraffin (v/v, 1:3)), 0.1 M Cd precursor solution (obtained by dissolving CdO in oleic acid and paraffin (v/v, 1:3)) were loaded in a three-neck flask with a Cd:Te:Se molar ratio of 10:1:1. The mixture was then heated to 320 °C under a N2 atmosphere and kept at this temperature for 10 min, followed by the addition of 2.0 mL of OAm into the reaction system and kept for another 8 min at 260 °C. The procedures for isolation and purification of the obtained CdSexTe1−x QDs were the same as those used for CdSe QDs as described above. The optical properties and TEM images of the obtained CdSe QDs and CdSexTe1−x QDs are available in Fig. S1 of the ESI.†
Preparation of linker molecule (TGA, MPA, and Cys) capped water soluble QDs
The water-soluble QDs were prepared via a ligand exchange route according to a literature method.5–7,49 Typically, 2.0 mmol of TGA, MPA, or Cys phase transfer agent (i.e. linker molecule) was first dissolved in 1.0 mL of methanol, and then the pH of the solution was adjusted to 11 with the use of 30% NaOH aqueous solution. 30 mL of the purified CdSe quantum dot dispersion in CH2Cl2 (containing CdSe QD 0.4 mmol) was equally divided into three portions. To each CdSe QD dispersion, the phase transfer agent solution was added and stirred for 2 h to get the precipitation of QDs. Then the linker molecule capped CdSe QDs were extracted from CH2Cl2 solution by adding 10.0 mL deionized water. The CdSe QD aqueous dispersion was further purified by centrifugation and decantation with the addition of acetone, and the precipitate was re-dissolved in 2.0 mL deionized water. The pH of the obtained CdSe aqueous solution was adjusted to 11.0 for use in the next step. Similarly, TGA-, MPA-, or Cys-capped water-soluble CdSexTe1−x QDs were prepared using the same procedure.
Fabrication of QD-sensitized photoanodes and solar cells
The photoanodes consist of a double layer TiO2 mesoporous film (i.e. transparent layer and light-scattering/opaque layer) coated on fluorine doped SnO2 (FTO, 8 Ω per square) glass substrates.50 Before the coating of the TiO2 film, the cleaned FTO glass was treated at 70 °C for 30 min with 40 mM TiCl4 aqueous solution for the formation of a compact TiO2 layer on the FTO substrate. The transparent layer (9.0 ± 0.5 μm) was then coated on the FTO substrate by successive screen-printing of a home-made P25 paste, followed by a 6.0 ± 0.5 μm thick light scattering layer with the use of paste containing 200–400 nm sized TiO2 particles. The electrodes were finally sintered at 500 °C for 15 min in a muffle-type furnace.
The QD sensitizers were immobilized on the TiO2 mesoporous films by pipetting 30 μL of linker molecule capped QD aqueous dispersion onto the film surface and keeping for 2–4 h before rinsing sequentially with water and ethanol and then dried with pressed air. After finishing deposition, the QD sensitized TiO2 films were coated with ZnS by four times dipping alternately into 0.1 M Zn(OAc)2 and 0.1 M Na2S solutions for 1 min per dip.
To prepare the Cu2S/brass counter electrode, brass foil was immersed in HCl solution (1.0 M) at 70 °C for 5 min and subsequently soaked into polysulfide electrolyte solution for 10 min. The polysulfide electrolyte solution was composed of Na2S (2.0 M), S (2.0 M), and KCl (0.2 M) in deionized water. The cell devices were constituted by assembling the Cu2S counter electrode and QD-sensitized photoanode by a binder clip and injecting 10 μL of electrolyte.
Characterization
The UV/vis absorption spectra and the PL emission spectra were recorded using a UV-visible spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-3101 PC) and a fluorescence spectrophotometer (Cary Eclipse Varian), respectively. Transition electron microscopy (TEM) images were obtained on a JEOL JEM-2100 microscope with an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. Current–voltage characteristics (J–V curves) of QDSCs were measured using a Keithley 2400 source meter and an AM 1.5G solar simulator (Oriel, Model no. 94022A) provided simulated illumination at an intensity of 100 mW cm−2. The photoactive area was 0.237 cm2, which was defined by a black plastic disk. The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectrum was recorded using a Keithley 2000 multimeter, and a spectral product DK240 monochromator with a 300 W tungsten lamp provided illumination. The electron injection rates from the QDs to TiO2 electrodes through different linker molecules were characterized using an improved transient grating (TG) technique. The principle of the improved TG method has been explained in detail.51–53 The laser source was a titanium/sapphire laser (CPA-2010, Clark-MXR Inc.) with a wavelength of 775 nm, a repetition rate of 1 kHz, and a pulse width of 150 fs. The light was separated into two parts. Half of it was used as a probe pulse. The other half of the light was used to pump an optical parametric amplifier (OPA) (a TOAPS from Quantronix) to generate light pulses with a wavelength tunable from 290 nm to 3 μm, used as a pump light in the TG measurement. In this study, the experiment was carried out under a N2 environment, and at an excitation wavelength of 620 nm. The probe light wavelength is 775 nm. The typical laser pulse intensity used in the TG experiments was as low as 2 mW. The area of the laser beam on the sample was about 0.2 cm2. The samples showed no apparent photo-damage during the TG measurements.
3. Results and discussion
In order to evaluate the influence of different linker molecules on the photovoltaic performance of the resulting QDSCs and therefore determine the optimum linker molecule, CdSe and CdSexTe1−x QD sensitized TiO2 photoanodes were obtained by the self-assembly of the studied linker molecule (i.e., TGA, MPA, and Cys) capped QDs on mesoporous TiO2 film photoanodes. All cell samples were constructed using polysulfide/sulfide aqueous solution as an electrolyte and Cu2S as a counter electrode and the photovoltaic performance was measured under standard conditions (100 mW cm−2, AM 1.5G). The selection of CdSe and CdSexTe1−x QD sensitizers is due to their facile and well-developed synthetic method, relatively broad light-harvesting range, and the satisfactory photovoltaic performance of the resulting QDSCs.5,35 The synthesis of oil-soluble oleylamine-capped CdSe (average 5.4 nm sized with the first excitonic absorption peak at 620 nm) and CdSexTe1−x QDs (average 5.2 nm sized with absorption edge at 800 nm), water-solubilization of the initial oil-soluble QDs into water-soluble linker molecule (TGA, MPA, or Cys) capped QDs, and the immobilization of water-soluble QDs onto the TiO2 film electrode followed our own recently developed literature methods,5,35 and the detailed procedure has been presented in the Experimental section. Under each condition, the average photovoltaic performance for at least five cells in parallel was analyzed.
Influence of cell photovoltaic performance by linker molecules

Fig. 2 shows the representative J–V curves of the QDSCs with intermediate performance based on different linker molecule capped QD sensitizers. The extracted average photovoltaic parameters of every group of cells are summarized in Table 1, with details of each cell available in Tables S1 and S2 of ESI.† From these data, we can find that the PCE values for both CdSe and CdSexTe1−x QDSCs based on different linker molecules show the same trend with TGA > MPA > Cys. The TGA linker based CdSe and CdSexTe1−x QDSCs exhibit the best PCE values of 5.40% and 6.68%, respectively. Furthermore, the enhanced PCEs of TGA based cells are mainly benefited from the improved short-circuit density (Jsc), while the open-circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF) of the corresponding cells are nearly independent of the linker molecules. We can therefore conclude that TGA serving as the linker molecule has the best photovoltaic performance for the QDSCs fabricated by the ex situ ligand exchange post-synthesis assembly approach. This conclusion is contrary to most of the previous results, where Cys based QDSCs show the best photovoltaic performance.26,40,44 It should be noted that, in most of these reports, the pre-prepared colloidal QD sensitizers were tethered on the TiO2 matrix via an in situ ligand exchange process, and the resultant QDSCs all show a relatively poor PCE (usually <2%) regardless whichever linker molecules used.

Hereafter, CdSe QD based solar cells were chosen to further study the influence of cell photovoltaic performance by linker molecules. Fig. 3a shows the absorption spectra of TGA-, MPA-, and Cys-capped CdSe QD sensitized TiO2 films with identical configuration and film thickness, and the corresponding photographs are shown in the inset. The absorption peaks of all the sensitized films are located at the same wavelength around 620 nm, and this indicates that no particle aggregation has occurred. Since the absorbance is directly related to the amount of QD sensitizer uploaded, we can find that the loading amount of CdSe QDs follows the order of TGA > MPA > Cys from the absorption spectra, which is consistent with the trend of PCE and Jsc of the resultant cell devices as described above. Obviously, higher loading of QD sensitizers on photoanodes can harvest more incident solar photons and achieve higher photocurrent, therefore the observed different loading amounts can partially explain the different Jsc values among TGA-, MPA- and Cys-QD based cell devices.

To further exploit the causes of the obtained different Jsc value, the incident-photo-to-carrier conversion efficiency (IPCE, i.e. external quantum yield, EQE) was measured in accordance with the conversion efficiency of monochromatic light irradiation and is shown in Fig. 3b. The IPCE responses show a similar spectral profile with the identical photoresponse range for three different cell devices, and the highest IPCE values for the TGA-, MPA-, and Cys-CdSe QDSCs are 79.4, 73.4, and 70.7%, respectively. In the whole light response range, the IPCE values for CdSe QDSCs based on different linker molecules follow the order of TGA > MPA > Cys, which is consistent with that of the corresponding Jsc values. But we cannot directly make a conclusion that the electron collection and/or injection efficiency of TGA based cells is higher than those of MPA and Cys based ones, since the IPCE values depend on a series of device parameters: IPCE = LHE × ϕinj × ηcc, where LHE is the light harvesting efficiency, ϕinj is the electron injection efficiency, and ηcc is the charge collection efficiency. To examine more accurately the electron collection and/or injection efficiency for different linker molecule based sensitizers, the APCE (absorbed photon to electron conversion efficiency) was calculated according to the following equation of APCE(λ) = IPCE(λ)/[1 − 10−Abs(λ)],54 where Abs(λ) is the absorbance of the photoanode at wavelength λ, and the results are shown in Fig. 3c. This takes out the effect of varying optical densities of the different electrodes. We can see that the APCE values corresponding to TGA based cells are still higher than that of MPA and Cys based cells in the whole light-response range, but the difference becomes lesser in comparison with that of IPCE. This clearly demonstrates that the electron collection and/or injection efficiency of the TGA based cells are higher than that of MPA and Cys based cells. Since these cells with the analogous configuration have similar ηcc,54 the difference of ϕinj should be the dominant factor that impacts the APCE values, which is supported by J–V curves under dark conditions of QDSCs (Fig. S2†) based on the studied three linker molecules (TGA, MPA, and Cys) displaying nearly identical curves with similar photovoltage onset and dark current value. This indicates that the electron injection is less efficient for the MPA- and Cys-capped CdSe QD sensitizers than the TGA-capped QD sensitizer, and the ϕinj of MPA-CdSe and Cys-CdSe is almost coincident. Therefore, higher coverage of QDs and higher electron injection efficiency at the QD–linker–TiO2 interface resulted in higher Jsc of TGA-CdSe sensitized solar cells. The observed different Jsc values of MPA and Cys based cell devices should be ascribed to the different loading amounts of QD sensitizers on TiO2 photoanode as shown in Fig. 3a. Compared to MPA and Cys, we speculate that TGA can increase the electron injection efficiency from QDs to the TiO2 matrix due to the reduction of the chain length by one sp3 hybridized C element.
Ultrafast carrier dynamics study
To further characterize the effects of the different linker molecules on the electron injection process from the QDs to TiO2, we employed the improved transient grating (TG) technique to measure the photoexcited carrier relaxation dynamics in QDs deposited on insulating SiO2 or TiO2 films through the three kinds of linker molecules. As explained in previous papers in detail,51–53 the TG decay provides a direct measurement of free electron and hole carrier dynamics in QDs. The experimental results are shown in Fig. 4. In the case of QDs on SiO2, there is no electron transfer from QDs to SiO2 because the conduction band of SiO2 is much higher than that of the QDs. As shown in Fig. 4a, when QDs deposited onto SiO2, there are only radiative and nonradiative recombination of charge carriers that contribute to the TG decay, so the three linker capped CdSe QDs have almost the same decay curves. However, for QDs on TiO2, photo-generated electrons in the QDs can be injected into TiO2 since the conduction band edge of TiO2 is lower than that of QDs. As shown in Fig. 4b, a significant faster decay can be observed for QDs deposited on TiO2 compared to those of QDs on SiO2 through different linker molecules, indicating electron injection occurring at the QD/TiO2 interface which is an additional pathway to carrier relaxation in QDs. The biexponential decay function (eqn (1)) was found to fit very well with the TG response as shown in Fig. 4 and the average lifetime (τav) was then estimated based on the fitting results by using eqn (2). y = A1e−t/τ1 + A2e−t/τ2 + y0(1) τav = (A1τ12 + A2τ22)/(A1τ1 + A2τ2)(2)where A1 and A2 are weighted coefficients and τ1 and τ2 are the lifetimes of the two exponential components, y0 is a constant corresponding to a carrier relaxation component with much longer lifetime than the measured time scale in this experiment (i.e., 400 ps), respectively. The fitting results and calculated average lifetime (τav) are listed in Table 2.

By comparing the TG decay processes of the QDs on TiO2 to those of QDs on SiO2, we can calculate the rate constants of electron transfer (ket) by the following eqn (3): ket = 1/τav(TiO2) − 1/τav(SiO2)(3)where τav(TiO2) represents the average lifetime of QDs on the TiO2 film and τav(SiO2) is the average lifetime of QDs on SiO2. According to eqn (3), we obtained electron injection rates (ket) of 8.0 × 109, 2.9 × 109, and 2.6 × 109 s−1 for TGA-CdSe, MPA-CdSe, and Cys-CdSe, respectively. It is noted that our observed ket value by the TG measurement is in the same level as obtained via transient absorption previously.23 The electron injection rate of TGA-CdSe is distinctly higher than those of MPA-CdSe and Cys-CdSe. This observation also confirms that TGA, reducing the length of chain by one sp3 hybridized C element, prefers to electron transfer compared to MPA and Cys. The higher electron injection rate will contribute to higher IPCE value and higher short circuit current, and actually this has been demonstrated in the former section.
4. Conclusions
In summary, TGA, MPA, and Cys as capping ligands around QDs and as linker molecules in immobilization of QD sensitizers on TiO2 photoanodes were investigated for the influence of the electron injection from QDs to the TiO2 matrix and the photovoltaic performance of the resultant solar cells. The photovoltaic performance of TGA-QD shows the best results of 5.40% (for the CdSe cell) and 6.68% (for the CdSexTe1−x cell) under full 1 sun illumination, respectively. The enhanced PCE of TGA based QDSCs is mainly a result of the improved short-circuit density (Jsc), and the increase of Jsc is based on: (i) TGA-capped QDs can boost the electron transfer rate and accompanied electron injection efficiency (ϕinj) from QDs to TiO2 as illustrated by the TG measurement and APCE characterization; and (ii) compared to MPA- and Cys-QD, TGA-QD provides a higher loading on the TiO2 film, which harvests more incident solar photons. The obtained results open up a new way to improve the photovoltaic performance of QDSCs.
