    , Accepted 15th August 2018First published on 16th August 2018AbstractIn the current work, we reported the engineering of homo/hetero junctions for boosting the photoelectrochemical (PEC) behaviors of all-inorganic perovskite SrTiO3 (STO) nanofibers. The engineering of these junctions was accomplished via spin-coating and electrospinning, followed by atomic layer deposition (ALD). The introduced STO film leads to the formation of the STO/STO homojunction, which provided an extended contact area to enhance the electron–hole mobility across the interface. Meanwhile, ALD-deposited ZnO allowed for the construction of the STO/ZnO heterojunction, which could build up internal electric fields at the interface to hinder the recombination of electron–hole pairs, causing a totally enhanced photoelectrochemical (PEC) activity. As a proof of concept, at an applied bias of 1.23 V vs. RHE, the photocurrent density of STO nanofibers with engineered homo/hetero junctions was enhanced more than 600 times that of their pristine STO counterpart. At 0 V vs. Ag/AgCl, their photocurrent density was improved up to ∼61.3 μA cm−2 in comparison to 0.12 μA cm−2 of their pristine STO counterpart. Furthermore, their photocurrent stability was increased from 79.62% of their pristine STO counterpart to 98% at 0.1 V vs. Ag/AgCl.
1 Introduction
Producing clean and renewable energy has been on the agenda for decades to tackle the global crisis of energy and environmental issues. As a quintessential method of hydrogen production, photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting to generate hydrogen is recognized as one of the most promising strategies for direct chemical energy conversion and storage by utilizing solar energy.1–4
Since the discovery of water splitting using TiO2 by Honda and Fujishima,5 there have emerged hundreds of semiconductors with exciting PEC activities for hydrogen evolution.6,7 In particular, SrTiO3 (STO), as a well-known cubic-perovskite-type multimetallic oxide with good flatband potential and photovoltage (Voc) and excellent chemical and photochemical stability, is deemed a favorable choice as a semiconductor photoelectrode material for PEC applications.8–15 There are some typical strategies to enhance the PEC activities of perovskite STO: (i) transforming photoelectrode materials into nanostructured ones. In comparison to conventional bulks, nanostructured photoelectrodes hold the merits of higher surface area/volume ratios with significantly increased reaction sites for water splitting. More importantly, one-dimensional (1D) (e.g., nanorods, nanowires and nanofibers) semiconducting nanostructures could further facilitate the transport of charge carriers due to their unique configuration.16–19 (ii) Constructing heterojunctions. A rationally designed heterojunction with matchable band gaps can be effective to enhance the PEC performance of STO, since it could elaborate the activities from each component with improved light harvesting. Also, the staggered band edge position between junctions could prompt interfacial electron transfer and act as potential traps for photo-generated electrons, leading to the effective separation of photoexcited carriers. However, the PEC activities of most reported studies (e.g., STO/TiO2,20 Ag3PO4/STO,21 STO/α-Fe2O3,22 Cu2O/STO23 and STO/ZnO24) were still at a low level, with the highest photocurrent density of just 7.75 μA cm−2 at 0 V vs. Ag/AgCl ever reported.20
Here, we report a strategy for boosting the PEC activities of all-inorganic perovskite STO nanofibers by engineering homo/hetero junctions. We introduce a spin-coated transitional STO film to render the formation of an STO/STO homojunction between the spun STO nanofibers and FTO substrate, which could enable a large contact area to fundamentally improve the high electron–hole mobility across the interface. Meanwhile, we applied the ALD technique for precise control of the thicknesses of the ZnO layer for the construction of the STO/ZnO heterojunction, which could build up internal electric fields at the interface to limit the recombination of electron–hole pairs, leading to a totally enhanced photoelectrochemical (PEC) activity. The fabrication of a photoanode for STO/ZnO homo/hetero junctions is schematically shown in Scheme 1. As expected, at an applied bias of 1.23 V vs. RHE, the photocurrent density of the STO nanofibers with engineered homo/hetero junctions was enhanced more than 600 times compared to that of their pristine STO counterpart.

2 Experimental methods
2.1 Materials
The raw materials, such as polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP, MW = 130000, K88 ∼ 96), polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP, MW = 58000, K30), strontium nitrate (Sr(NO3)2), titanium butoxide (TBOT), acetic acid (CH3COOH), ethanol (CH3CH2OH) and N,N-dimethyl formamide (DMF), were obtained from Adamas-beta (Shanghai, China). All chemical reagents were of analytical grade and used without any further treatment.
2.2 Procedure for the synthesis of the photoanode

2.2.1 Preparation of the spin-coating solution and spinning solution¶. 
In a typical process, 0.1 g PVP (K30) powder was added to 8 ml ethanol solution, followed by being stirred for 5 h (referred to as solution A). Meanwhile, 0.3175 g Sr(NO3)2 was introduced into the mixture of 2 ml CH3COOH, 1 ml DMF and 1 ml ultrapure water, followed by being stirred for 2 h (referred to as solution B). Then the obtained solutions of A and B were mixed together, followed by being stirred for 2 h (referred to as solution C). Subsequently, 0.51 g TBOT was added to solution C. After stirring at room temperature (RT) for 2 h, the spin-coating solution of PVP/TBOT/Sr(NO3)2 composites was obtained. By using 0.6 g PVP (K96) instead of 0.1 g PVP (K30), the other spinning solution of PVP/TBOT/Sr(NO3)2 was obtained by a similar process, which is referred to as solution D.


2.2.2 Fabrication of the SrTiO3 photoanode. 
Firstly, FTO glass was cleaned sequentially by sonication in acetone, ethanol and ultrapure water; secondly, 60 μl of solution C was uniformly coated on the exposed area of the FTO glass (1.0 × 1.0 cm2, the remaining area was protected with high-temperature tape) by dynamic spin coating, and subjected to drying at 80 °C for 6 h (referred to as sample STOfilm). Then, the STO film was further coated with STO nanofibers on the FTO glass by electrospinning, for which the parameters are shown in Table S1 (ESI†). After that, the FTO glass with the coated STO film and as-spun STO nanofibers was dried at 80 °C for 6 h and calcined in a muffle furnace at 550 °C for 1 h with a heating rate of 5 °C min−1. Finally, ZnO layers with different cycles were deposited using a T-ALD system (Kemicro Co. Ltd). The ALD experimental details are shown in Table S2 (ESI†), and diethyl zinc and ultrapure water were used as zinc and oxygen sources, respectively. The resultant samples with different ZnO deposition cycles are referred to as STO@ZnOnC; e.g., the products with fixed ALD cycles of 0, 100, 200, 300, 400 and 500 are referred to as samples STO, STO@ZnO100C, STO@ZnO200C, STO@ZnO300C, STO@ZnO400C and STO@ZnO500C, respectively. In comparison, the STO nanofibers were also electrospun on the FTO substrate without coating the STO film, which is referred to as sample STOfiber.

2.3 Characterization
The phase constitutions were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD, D8 Advance, Bruker, Germany). The morphologies and microstructures were characterized using a field-emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, S-4800, Hitachi, Japan) and high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM, JEM-2100F, JEOL, Japan), which were equipped with an energy dispersive X-ray spectroscope (EDX, Quantax-STEM, Bruker, Germany). The ultraviolet-visible diffuse reflectance spectrum (DRS) was recorded using a UV-Vis spectrophotometer (UV-3900, Hitachi, Japan) by using BaSO4 as the reference.
2.4 PEC measurements and electrochemical charaterization
The electrochemical analysis was carried out in a three-electrode cell. The STO photoanode, Ag/AgCl and Pt electrodes were used as the working, reference and counter electrodes, respectively. 0.5 M Na2SO4 aqueous solutions (pH = 6.82) were used as electrolytes. A 300 W Xe lamp with an AM 1.5G filter (100 mW cm−1−2) was utilized as a light source. The photoelectrochemical responses of the electrodes were analyzed on an electrochemical analyzer (PGSTAT302N, Metrohm, Netherlands). The measurement of incident photo-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was performed under illumination with respect to a calibrated silicon diode. For the IPCE experiments, the working electrode was biased at 0 V vs. Ag/AgCl. The monochromatic light was supplied by a xenon lamp illuminating through a cornerstone monochromator. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed at an open circuit potential over the frequencies ranging from 100 to 0.01 Hz, with an AC voltage of 10 mV amplitude. The measured EIS data were fitted using ZSimpwin software. The Mott–Schottky plot was obtained in a 0.5 M Na2SO4 electrolyte without light irradiation over the frequencies ranging from 50 to 3000 Hz. Potentials were converted using the following equation: E (vs. RHE) = pH × 0.059 + 0.197 + EAg/AgCl.
3 Results and discussion

Fig. 1(a) presents the plan-view SEM image of the pure STO photoanode prepared through dynamic spin coating, unveiling the nanoparticle morphology of sample STOfilm. As shown in Fig. 1(b), it seems that densely packed STO nanofibers with a uniform diameter are covered on the STO film substrate after electrospinning and post annealing processes. Fig. 1(c) and the inset provide the morphology of a single STO nanofiber observed at a higher magnification, disclosing that the products are 1D nanostructures with a rough surface and an average diameter of ∼75 nm. Fig. 1(d and e) present the representative TEM image and selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern of a single STO nanofiber, suggesting its polycrystalline nature. The diffraction spot rings could be indexed to the crystal planes of (110), (111), (200) and (211) of cubic perovskite STO (JCPDS card no. 35-0734) in sequence. Fig. 1(f) shows a typical HRTEM image recorded from the marked area of A in Fig. 1(d). The clear lattices with a spacing distance of 0.276 nm correspond to the (110) plane of cubic STO. The elemental mappings of O (Fig. S1(b), ESI†), Ti (Fig. S1(c), ESI†) and Sr (Fig. S1(d), ESI†) evidence their homogeneous spatial distributions throughout the STO fiber body (Fig. S1(a), ESI†).

The representative XRD patterns of the as-prepared sample STO with ZnO deposition cycles of 0, 100, 200, 300, 400 and 500 are given in Fig. 2. The results disclose that the diffraction peaks at 22.78°, 32.42°, 39.98°, 46.48°, 57.79°, 67.87° and 72.54° of all the samples match the standard ones of perovskite-type STO (JCPDS 35-0734), which correspond to the diffractions from (100), (110), (111), (200), (210), (211), (220), (300) and (310) crystal planes, respectively. As for the five STO@ZnO hybrids, additional diffraction peaks are detected at 34.47°, 36.52°, 57.17° and 63.10°, which are assigned to the diffractions of the (002), (101), (110) and (103) crystal planes of hexagonal ZnO (JCPDS card no. 75-1526), respectively. The other sharp and strong diffractions are ascribed to perovskite-type STO, suggesting that the obtained products are composed of perovskite STO and hexagonal ZnO. The enlarged (110) diffractions in the range of 2θ = 30–34° (the inset in Fig. 2) reveal that the peak position of STO after ALD of ZnO has been slightly shifted toward a lower 2θ value. Such a shift is mainly attributed to the incorporation of Zn atoms into the Ti sites of STO, rather than the substitution of Zn2+ for Sr2+, because the ionic radius of Zn2+ (0.074 nm) is a little larger than that of Ti4+ (0.0605 nm) but smaller than that of Sr2+ (0.118 nm).

Fig. 3(a and b) show the typical SEM images of the hybrid STO/ZnO photoanode after 300-cycle ALD ZnO deposition based on sample STO (i.e., sample STO@ZnO300C). It seems that their morphology is almost identical to that of the undeposited one. However, a closer observation of a single nanofiber (the inset in Fig. 3(b)) reveals that the initially rough nanofibers (the inset in Fig. 1(c)) have changed to relatively smoother ones. Their typical diameter rises to ∼120 nm after ZnO deposition, suggesting that a ZnO layer with a thickness of ∼20 nm has been successfully deposited around the STO fibers. The energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) analyses were performed for the nanofilm and nanofibers, and the results are presented in Fig. S2 (ESI†), respectively, revealing that both consist mainly of Ti, Sr, Zn and O elements. Their detailed atomic ratios are provided in Table S3 and S4 (ESI†), suggesting that the hybrid products are composed of ZnO and STO, and the surface of an STO nanofiber is coated with a ZnO film (Fig. 3(c–f)). The thickness of STOfilm@ZnO300C and STOfiber@ZnO300C is 360 ± 20 nm and 1 ± 08 μm, respectively (Fig. S3 in the ESI†). Fig. 3(d) shows the corresponding SAED pattern, showing two-component crystalline characteristics with a polycrystalline nature. One set of spots in the SAED pattern is indexed to hexagonal ZnO (JCPDS card no. 75-1526), and the other is assigned to the cubic STO (JCPDS card no. 35-0734). Fig. 3(e) presents its representative HRTEM image recorded from the marked area of B in Fig. 3(c). The fringes with a lattice spacing of ∼0.276 nm correspond to the (110) plane of cubic STO, whereas those of ∼0.26 nm correspond to the (100) plane of hexagonal ZnO. Furthermore, this confirms that the deposited ZnO has solid contact with STO, leading to the formation of STO/ZnO heterojunctions. Fig. 3(g–j) show the elemental mappings of Ti, Sr, O and Zn, respectively. It is noteworthy that the Ti and Sr appear with homogeneous distribution configurations, whereas most of the Zn and O are distributed along the outer layer of the fiber (Fig. 3(f)), implying the formation of core–shell structures. The thickness of the ZnO layer is ∼20 nm (Fig. 3(f)), which is in agreement with the SEM and TEM observations.

The light absorption capabilities of the bare STO and STO@ZnO hybrid photoanodes were investigated using a UV-vis spectrometer, as shown in Fig. 4(a). This discloses that the pristine STO shows an absorption edge in 370 nm UV light. However, the samples of STO@ZnOnC photoanodes present a red shift from 370 to 410 nm in the absorption edge with the increase of ZnO thicknesses, indicating their enhanced light absorption. The observed red shift of the absorption peaks is probably due to the doping of zinc ions on the surface of STO. The band energy levels could be calculated from the Tauc plot using25–27 αhν = A(hν − Eg)2/n(1)where α, h, ν, A and Eg are the optical absorption coefficient near the absorption edge, Planck's constant, light frequency and optical absorbance, respectively. The n value depends on the characteristics of the type of optical transition in the semiconductor. For STO and ZnO, the n value is 4, since both belong to direct semiconductors. As shown in Fig. 4(b), the band gaps of the STO@ZnO hybrids all exhibit a significant decrease as compared to that of bare STO. For the STO with the optimized 300-cycle ALD of ZnO, its band gap could be reduced to 3.07 eV, in respect to 3.34 eV of its intrinsic counterpart. This implies that the formed STO@ZnO heterojunctions with the precisely controlled thicknesses of deposited ZnO could not only improve the light harvesting activity, but also modify the electronic structures of the photoanode to enhance PEC water splitting.

Fig. 5(a) compares the transient photocurrent density–potential (J–V) curves of samples STO@ZnOnC in 0.5 M Na2SO4 electrolyte under the chopped AM 1.5G irradiation at 100 mW cm−2. Regardless of the number of ALD cycles fixed, the resultant STO@ZnO hybrid photoanodes have significantly improved photocurrent densities as compared to the bare STO, verifying that the deposited ZnO can effectively enhance the PEC activities of STO. Notably, the photocurrent density increases first with the rise of the number of ALD cycles up to 300 and then reduces once the number of cycles is increased further up to 400 and 500. Correspondingly, the highest photocurrent density of ∼309.8 μA cm−2 (at 1.23 V vs. RHE) can be achieved with 300 ALD cycles, which is more than 600 times that of pure STO nanofibers electrospun directly on the FTO substrate (i.e., sample STOfiber) (∼0.5 μA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE) (Fig. S4, ESI†). To further investigate the photoresponse of the samples STO@ZnOnC, the transient photocurrent density at 0 V vs. Ag/AgCl (0.6 V vs. RHE) under light chopping is studied, and the results are shown in Fig. 5(b) and S5.† All the samples exhibit an excellent switching behavior, suggesting the fast charge transport during the PEC reaction. Among them, a remarkably enhanced photocurrent density is observed for the STO@ZnOnC hybrid photoanodes with a maximum photocurrent density of ∼61.3 μA cm−2, when the number of ZnO ALD cycles is fixed at 300. However, the samples of the FTO substrate, STO, ZnO300C (referred to as the sample with 300 ALD cycles of ZnO on the FTO substrate) and STOfilm@ZnO300C (referred to as the sample subjected to 300 ALD cycles of ZnO on the FTO substrate with the coated STO film) produce very low photocurrents of ∼0, ∼3.4, ∼0.34 and 9.17 μA cm−2 during the light-on cycle (Fig. S5, ESI†), respectively, confirming that the high photocurrent of STO@ZnO300C is mainly contributed from the introduced STO film and deposited ZnO. More interestingly, the photocurrent of ∼61.3 μA cm−2 is the highest one among those of STO-based photoanodes under similar irradiation conditions and 0 V vs. Ag/AgCl, which could be ∼8 times that of the highest one ever reported in the literature (Table S5, ESI†). Furthermore, the stability of the STO@ZnO300C photoanode as well as the bare counterparts (i.e., STO and ZnO) is measured at 0.1 V vs. Ag/AgCl (Fig. 5(c)). This discloses that no significant photocurrent decay (∼1.24%) over 2000 s can be observed over the STO@ZnO300C sample, representing its decent stability for PEC water splitting. However, the photocurrents of the bare counterparts exhibit a rapid degradation of ∼20.38% (STO) and 85.25% (ZnO) after 2000 s irradiation (the enlarged ones of STO and ZnO, see Fig. S6, ESI†), evidencing that the stability of the STO@ZnO300C photoanode has been significantly enhanced as compared to that of the bare ones.

(c) The stability of the photoanodes based on the STO@ZnO300C heterojunction, STO and ZnO300C measured at 0.1 V bias (vs. Ag/AgCl). 
To get more insights into the enhanced charge separation and transfer of the photogenerated carriers within the STO@ZnOnC hybrid photoanode, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is conducted under AM 1.5 G illumination. Fig. 6(a) presents the EIS Nyquist plots of the pristine STO and STO@ZnO photoanodes, disclosing that all the five STO@ZnO hybrid photoanodes possess much smaller radii than pristine STO. It is known that a smaller arc in the Nyquist plot represents a lower charge transfer resistance at the interface of the electrode, thus facilitating a faster interfacial charge transfer and more efficient separation of the photo-induced electron–hole pairs.28,29 Therefore, these experimental results confirm that the formation of STO/ZnO heterojunctions remarkably promotes the charge separation and transfer, leading to an enhanced PEC water splitting activity. In particular, the smallest arc radius of STO@ZnO300C should be responsible for the highest PEC performance, which is in line with the photocurrent density evolution (Fig. 5(a and b)). A typical equivalent circuit model is used to fit the EIS data, as shown in the inset in Fig. 6(a),30,31 which consists of a series resistance (Rs), a surface states charge trapping resistance (Rtrap), a charge transfer resistance (Rct), a depletion layer capacitance (CPEbulk), and a surface states trapped charge capacitance (CPEss). The fitting results for different photoanodes are given in Table 1. The fitted Rs for the different photoanodes is similar, because the STO substrates of the different samples are alike. However, the Rtrap and Rct declined by orders of magnitude once ZnO is deposited. It seems that both Rtrap (21.97) and Rct (70100) are relatively small when the ZnO ALD cycles are fixed at 300, which are consistent with the results of the observed PEC activities.

To further elucidate the role of ZnO, the incident photo-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of bare STO and STO@ZnO300C electrodes are collected at 0 V vs. Ag/AgCl, as shown in Fig. 6(b). The IPCE is determined from short circuit photocurrents monitored at different excitation wavelengths using the following equation:22,32 (2)where Iph is the photocurrent (mA), λ is the wavelength (nm) of incident radiation, and P is the incident light power intensity on the electrode at a selected wavelength (mW). In comparison to the bare STO photoanodes, the STO@ZnO300C hybrid photoanode not only shows a higher IPCE in the whole range, but also has a broader IPCE spectrum in the UV region. These results indicate that the presence of ZnO promotes the photon absorption and collection via the band gap transition of STO, which is consistent with UV-vis absorption spectroscopy. In addition, the IPCE reached a maximum of ∼16.43% at ∼380 nm for the STO@ZnO hybrid photoanode, which is ∼44 times that of bare STO at ∼370 nm (i.e., ∼0.37%).
Mott–Schottky (M–S) measurements are conducted to further investigate the intrinsic electrical structures and charge carrier densities of the bare STO and STO@ZnO300C hybrid photoanodes. As shown in Fig. 6(c), both photoanodes have a positive slope characteristic, confirming their n-type semiconductor nature. Generally, a smaller slope of the M–S curve means a larger charge carrier concentration in the photoanode.33 In addition, the flat-band potential could be obtained from the x-axis intercept, which is taken by extrapolating the M–S plot to C−2 = 0. It seems that the flat-band potential of STO is negatively shifted by 0.06 V caused by the incorporated ZnO. It is recognized that a more negative flat-band potential provides a higher quasi-Fermi level of electrons to drive a greater separation of the holes,34,35 which suggests that the deposited ZnO could facilitate the charge separation of the as-prepared STO@ZnO hybrid photoanodes.
Now we come to the point on the enhanced PEC behaviors of the STO@ZnO hybrid photoanode, which could be mainly attributed to the as-constructed STO/STO homojunctions and STO/ZnO heterojunctions, as schematically shown in Fig. 7(a1-a2–c1-c2) and the diagrams of atomic structures in Fig. 7(a3, b3 and c3), respectively. When the as-spun STO nanofibers are directly deposited on the FTO substrate (i.e., sample STOfiber), the contact between the fibers and substrate can be considered as a line-to-face one (Fig. 7(a1 and a2)). In this configuration, the generated photocurrent is only 0.5 μA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE (Fig. 7(a4)). The photocurrent from the FTO substrate decreases to 0.17 μA cm−2 (Fig. 7(a4)), which is ignored during the following discussion. However, once a transition layer of the STO film is introduced via spinning coating between the nanofibers and FTO substrate before electrospinning the STO nanofibers (i.e., sample STO), the photocurrent can be remarkably enhanced up to 6.32 μA cm−2 (at 1.23 V vs. RHE), which is much higher than those of the STOfilm (i.e., 1.82 μA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE) and STOfiber (i.e., 0.5 μA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE) alone in the entire potential range (Fig. 7(b4)). This represents that the photocurrent density of the STO nanofibers has been enhanced more than 12 times with the introduced STO transition film. In this configuration, a STO/STO homojunction would be built, causing the line-to-face contact between the fibers and substrate to be changed into a face-to-face one, as schematically shown in Fig. 7(a1-a2–c1-c2). Such an introduced homojunction could have a fundamental effect on the PEC activities of the photoanode, which is schematically illustrated in Fig. S7 (ESI†). Firstly, the intimate face-to-face contact renders a much larger contact area to facilitate the electron–hole mobility across the interface, which will reduce the distance and time of charge transport to impede the electron–hole recombination rate; secondly, the transitional film provides solid contact of the as-spun STO nanofibers with the FTO substrate (Fig. S8, ESI†), which is crucial to the long-term PEC reaction; thirdly, the porous nanofilm substrate (see Fig. 1(a)) favors the fast electrolyte infiltration to enhance the reaction kinetics. These structural characteristics as mentioned above could endow the STO photoanode with synergistic effects to obtain the best PEC performance. Meanwhile, once ZnO is further deposited via ALD with precisely tailored thicknesses (as shown in Fig. 7(c1–c3)), the n–n type heterojunctions would be built. In this configuration, the optimized photocurrent density of the STO@ZnO300C photoanode (i.e., 309.8 μA cm−2) is much higher than those of the STO (i.e., 6.32 μA cm−2), pure ZnO300C (i.e., 38.5 μA cm−2), and STOfilm@ZnO300C (i.e., 66.18 μA cm−2) at 1.23 V vs. RHE (Fig. 7(c4)). Interestingly, the photocurrent density of the STO nanofibers could be enhanced more than 600 times by engineering the STO/STO homojunction and STO/ZnO heterojunction (i.e., from 0.5 μA cm−2 of STOfiber to 309.8 μA cm−2 of STO@ZnO300C at 1.23 V vs. RHE). A tentative mechanism for such significantly enhanced PEC behaviors from the constructed heterojunction of STO/ZnO is illustrated in Fig. 8. It is known that the valence band (VB) and conduction band (CB) are located at 2.14 and −1.26 eV (referenced by NHE) for STO,36,37 and those for ZnO are located at 2.89 and −0.31 eV (referenced by NHE),38 respectively. The energy difference of the band edge positions between STO and ZnO could build up internal electric fields at the interface. Accordingly, the photogenerated electrons in the CB of STO tend to migrate to ZnO, whereas the photogenerated holes in the VB tend to transfer from ZnO to STO. As a result, the recombination of the electron–hole pairs could be greatly limited, which could facilitate an increased lifetime of the photogenerated charge carriers, leading to the enhanced PEC activities of the photoanodes. In brief, the PEC activity of the STO nanofibers can be significantly enhanced by engineering homo/hetero junctions. The introduced transition STO film causes the formation of the STO/STO homojunction, which could enable a large contact area to facilitate high electron–hole mobility across the interface as well as solid contact with the substrate. The deposited ZnO causes the construction of the STO/ZnO heterojunction, which could build up internal electric fields at the interface to limit the recombination of the electron–hole pairs, which consequently boosts the PEC activities of the photoanodes with high efficiency and stability.

4 Conclusions
In conclusion, we have demonstrated a strategy for boosting the PEC activities of perovskite STO nanofibers by engineering homo/hetero junctions through three sequential steps including spin coating, electrospinning and ALD. The formation of the STO/STO homojunction is achieved by the introduction of a spin-coated transitional STO film on the substrate of FTO before electrospinning STO fibers, which could be effective to obtain a significantly enlarged contact area to enhance the electron–hole mobility across the interface with solid contact between the as-spun STO fibers and FTO substrate. The construction of the STO/ZnO heterojunction is accomplished by ALD deposition of ZnO with precisely controlled thicknesses, which could build up internal electric fields at the interface to limit the recombination of the electron–hole pairs. Such rationally engineered homo/heterojunctions lead to totally enhanced PEC activities for STO nanofibers. At an applied bias of 1.23 V vs. RHE, the photocurrent density of the STO nanofibers with engineered homo/hetero junctions is enhanced more than 600 times compared to that of their pristine STO counterpart. At 0 V vs. Ag/AgCl, their photocurrent density is improved up to ∼61.3 μA cm−2, which was ∼8 times the highest one ever reported for STO-based photoanodes. In addition, the photoanode with homo/hetero junctions exhibits fundamentally improved long-term stability as compared to the bare STO and ZnO alone. It is promising that the current work might provide an effective and versatile solution to boost the PEC performance of electrode materials by engineering homo/hetero junctions.
