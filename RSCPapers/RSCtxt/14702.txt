    , Accepted 3rd February 2020First published on 3rd February 2020AbstractWe have considered a zero-dimensional hybrid halide perovskite derivative system, namely MA3(Sb1−xBix)2I9, to study the bandgap dependence on metal substitution. Similar to tin-lead mixed halide perovskites (MASn1−xPbxI3), the composition dependence of the optical bandgap in the MA3(Sb1−xBix)2I9 solid-state alloys showed evidence of a quadratic (bow-like) behavior where an intermediate compound containing an equimolar contribution of antimony and bismuth, MA3(Sb0.5Bi0.5)2I9 offered the narrowest bandgap of around 1.90 eV; this is markedly lower than the bandgap of the end members MA3Sb2I9 (2.36 eV) and MA3Bi2I9 (2.16 eV). In addition, we have observed the bowing in the transport gap of MA3(Sb1−xBix)2I9 that has been derived from scanning tunneling spectroscopy and density of states spectra thereof. To explain the underlying mechanism, we speculate that an antagonism between spin orbit coupling and its competing component, namely lattice strain, may have led to this bow-like nature in both optical and transport gaps. The band-diagram of heterojunctions based on MA3(Sb1−xBix)2I9 accordingly depended on the metal-composition; solar cell characteristics of the heterojunctions followed the change in the bandgap, morphology, and also the exciton binding energy.
1. Introduction
In the quest for lead-free solar energy materials, perovskite-like compounds containing trivalent metal cations, such as bismuth (Bi3+) or antimony (Sb3+), have recently become a topic of interest.1,2 Apart from addressing the toxicity issue associated with traditional lead-based perovskites, these potential alternatives have shown superior stability under ambient conditions along with promising light harvesting properties.3 These materials are typically expressed by a generic structural formula A3B2X9, where A and X are a monovalent cation and a halogen, respectively, whereas, for the B-sites, trivalent group-V elements (Bi3+ or Sb3+) have been the choice due to their isoelectronic configuration (s2p0) to lead (Pb2+) and the presence of lone-pair states.4,5 Depending on the choice of the A-site cation, these A3B2X9 compounds can exist in a couple of typical polymorphs,6 namely, a two-dimensional (2D) layered structure (for A = rubidium, cesium) or a zero-dimensional (0D) dimer-like structure (for A = methylammonium), where, the formation of the latter one is thermodynamically favored.7,8 However, due to a strong dimensional reduction in the dimer-phase, A3B2X9 compounds namely, methylammonium bismuth iodide (MA3Bi2I9) and methylammonium antimony iodide (MA3Sb2I9), are unfortunately associated with some intrinsic limitations including a wide optical bandgap, inferior carrier transport and strong quantum confinement effect making them less favorable for photovoltaic applications.9,10 With limited options of suitable trivalent metal cations for the B-sites, efforts to bring down the optical bandgap have mostly been focused on heterovalent substitutions at the metal and halogen sites,11,12 whereas, an improved carrier transport has been reported in the layered phase.8 Conversely, due to a smaller effective ionic radius (rion) of antimony than bismuth (the rion of Sb3+ and Bi3+ is 76 and 103 pm, respectively), MA3Sb2I9 offered a lower exciton binding energy than MA3Bi2I9.10 In spite of such strategies, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of solar cells based on these lead-free alternatives is yet to flourish.1,10
Solid-state alloying has been a widely used tool to address some distinct shortcomings of halide perovskites, such as, the restricted range of optical bandgaps and chemical stability.13,14 With bismuth and antimony being the ideal options for a trivalent element at the B-sites, the search for a route to lower the bandgap of MA3B2I9 compounds by forming MA3(Sb1−xBix)2I9 solid state alloys is apparently blocked if a linear dependence of the bandgap on the composition is maintained following Vegard's law. In this respect, a nonmonotonic and nonlinear (quadratic) characteristic has been recently observed in MAPbI3-based perovskite alloys.15 The effect, which is commonly termed as “bandgap bowing”, led to the achievement of a lower bandgap in the intermediate compounds of MASn1−xPbxI3 solid solutions than the end members. To be precise, in such perovskite alloys, an equimolar combination of tin and lead (x = 0.5) has offered the narrowest bandgap of around 1.10 eV, whereas, bandgaps of the end members MAPbI3 and MASnI3 were estimated to be 1.55 and 1.30 eV, respectively.16 While the phenomenon has a strong technological significance, the origin of such a bandgap bowing is yet to be clearly understood. It has been proposed so far through first principles calculations that either an energy mismatch between the atomic orbitals of the parent materials or a competing effect of spin–orbit coupling in the electronic structure and modification in the crystal structure due to lattice-strains could be responsible for the so-called bowing effect.15
In this work, we accordingly aimed to lower the bandgap of the zero-dimensional MA3Sb2I9 perovskite derivative through isovalent metal substitution by bismuth (Bi3+) that resulted in the formation of a completely miscible solid solution, MA3(Sb1−xBix)2I9 (0 ≤ x ≤ 1), of the parent components MA3Sb2I9 and MA3Bi2I9. The composition dependence of the optical bandgap in such MA3(Sb1−xBix)2I9 solid state alloys showed evidence of a quadratic nature (bowing) where an intermediate compound containing an equimolar contribution of antimony and bismuth (MA3(Sb0.5Bi0.5)2I9) offered the narrowest bandgap of around 1.90 eV, markedly lower than the bandgap of the end members MA3Sb2I9 (2.36 eV) and MA3Bi2I9 (2.16 eV). Evolution of the band edges in the materials was probed through scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) and the respective variation of the transport gap also showed a bow-like behavior that was predominantly governed by the movement of the conduction band edge. The mechanism behind this phenomenon could be due to an interplay between spin–orbit coupling and structural modifications induced by the isovalent substitution, although calculations would be required to corroborate this. In concurrence with such bandgap bowing, the power conversion efficiency of planar heterojunction solar cells based on Cu:NiO/MA3(Sb1−xBix)2I9/ZnO heterojunctions also showed a bowing effect with respect to the composition of the absorber layer. This work hence presents a systematic study on the bandgap bowing behavior in zero-dimensional MA3(Sb1−xBix)2I9 solid state alloys.
2. Results and discussion
2.1 Characterization of MA3(Sb1−xBix)2I9 solid state alloys
We have recorded optical absorption spectra of all MA3(Sb1−xBix)2I9 solid state alloys in their thin-film form to study the composition dependence of the bandgap. In Fig. 1a and b, we have presented representative spectra normalized to a film thickness of 125 nm and their corresponding Tauc plots, respectively. The spectra of MA3Sb2I9 and MA3Bi2I9 showed their characteristic peaks at around 466 and 505 nm, respectively, which matched with the reported results.2,17 It is worth mentioning here that the absorption spectrum of MA3Bi2I9 is dependent on the orientation of the crystals, indicating a strong charge carrier localization in the material.18 In addition, the presence of a pronounced peak in the absorption spectrum indicates the existence of excitons in MA3Bi2I9.18 In contrast, MA3Sb2I9 did not show any such strong excitonic nature in its absorption spectrum, indicating a lower density of defect states in the material than its bismuth analogue.10 The spectrum corresponding to the intermediate composition (x = 0.5) also did not show any strong excitonic nature, moreover, a clear red-shift of the absorption edge could be visible. A change in the bandgap upon bismuth substitution in MA3Sb2I9 was accordingly evidenced in the respective Tauc plots, as presented in Fig. 1b. It should be noted that, unlike MAPbI3, the organic group does not contribute to the bandgap of MA3B2I9 compounds.1

Inset of (a) shows photographs of representative MA3(Sb1−xBix)2I9 thin-films. 
When we studied the evolution of the optical bandgap in MA3(Sb1−xBix)2I9 (0 ≤ x ≤ 1) alloys with respect to the bismuth content (Fig. 1c), the variation of the bandgap showed a nonmonotonic and nonlinear nature. Such a behavior could further be fitted by a quadratic expression and in solid state theory of semiconductor alloys, and this phenomenon is commonly termed as ‘bandgap bowing’.19 As can be seen in the plot, the optical bandgap of MA3(Sb1−xBix)2I9 alloys showed a steep red-shift from its initial value of 2.36 eV (x = 0, MA3Sb2I9) to attain a minimum of 1.90 eV at an intermediate composition of MA3(Sb0.5Bi0.5)2I9 followed by a gradual and moderate blue-shift that saturates at 2.16 eV in MA3Bi2I9. Therefore, the optical bandgap of the composites over a range of antimony–bismuth combinations has a lower value as compared to the end members of the series. Such a change in the bandgap has also resulted in a change in the color of the films. As shown in the inset of Fig. 1a, the color of the films gradually changed from bright yellow in MA3Sb2I9 to a dark orange in MA3(Sb0.5Bi0.5)2I9 and finally to a bright orange in MA3Bi2I9 with an increase in bismuth-content.
We then aimed to carry out a detailed study on the composition dependence of the bandgap. As such, for any binary composition of semiconductors, the lattice parameter of the resultant alloys can be estimated from Vegard's law. According to this empirical rule, the lattice parameter of an alloy between two semiconductors is approximately equal to the rule of mixtures (linear relationship) of the two constituents' lattice parameters at the same temperature. In many binary semiconducting systems, the bandgap is approximately a linear function of the lattice parameter and therefore Vegard's law can be generalized to a linear relationship between the bandgap and composition also. Eg(x) = (1 − x)Eg|(x=0) + xEg|(x=1)(1)where Eg(x) is the bandgap of the composite with dopant content ‘x’ and Eg|(x=0) and Eg|(x=1) are bandgaps of the two end members of the family.
On the other hand, if the variation of the bandgap with composition cannot be portrayed by a linear interpolation between band energies, a quadratic curvature correction term is usually incorporated on the right hand side of eqn (1).20 With such an additional term, the equation can be represented as: Eg(x) = (1−x)Eg|(x=0) + xEg|(x=1) − bx(1 − x)(2)where b is the bowing coefficient that accounts for a deviation from the linearity, ΔEg(x) = bx(1 − x). The magnitude and nature of this bowing coefficient usually play a significant role in determining the origin of such a bandgap bowing in the intermediate compositions. Since, in general, the bandgap of a semiconductor alloy under the effect of bowing is smaller than the value estimated from the linear interpolation between the bandgaps of the end members, the bowing coefficient b is a positive quantity.21 Typically, if b is small (a fraction of an electronvolt) and independent of composition, the bowing in most cases can be explained by the structural disorder effect.22 This means that, in such materials, inclusion of a foreign element leads to a modification of the host crystal structure introducing strain into the host lattice. Such strains modify the lattice parameters and in turn tune the bandgap. In contrast, if the bowing coefficient becomes large or composition-dependent (for example, GaAs1−xNx alloys possess a b value of ∼16 eV), the origin of bandgap bowing is usually more complex to explain through a single phenomenon.23 Likewise, in the case of MA3(Sb1−xBix)2I9 solid solutions, the variation in the bandgap with metal-composition cannot be explained by a single bowing coefficient. A rough estimate using eqn (2) shows that while the value of the coefficient b in the antimony-rich region maintains almost a constant value which is larger than the value of the coefficient in the bismuth-rich region, the coefficient decreases sharply to a small value (a fraction of an electronvolt) with an increase in the bismuth content showing its composition dependent nature (Fig. 2). The overall value of b is close to the average of b in the two regions. The origin of bandgap bowing in MA3(Sb1−xBix)2I9 cannot be explained by a constant, composition independent, single bowing coefficient; instead, it can be divided into a couple of regions, each having its own dominance in the bandgap trend. Hence, replacing the constant bowing coefficient (b) in eqn (2) with a composition-dependent one (b′), the bandgap versus composition relationship can be modified as: Eg = (1−x)Eg|(x=0) + xEg|(x=1) − b′x(1 − x) where b′ = b(x)(3)

As a structural change also plays a crucial role in the occurrence of bandgap bowing, we also studied the crystal structure of the MA3(Sb1−xBix)2I9 thin-films. In this regard, we first of all aimed to achieve an insight into their structural stability by estimating the Goldschmidt tolerance factor (t) which is defined as:13 (4)where RA, RB, and RX are the effective ionic radii of A- and B-site cations and X-site anion, respectively. Following such an empirical formula and considering the radii of MA+ (RA = 180 pm), Sb3+ (RB = 76 pm), Bi3+ (RB = 103 pm), and I− (RX = 220 pm),24 the tolerance factor values for MA3Sb2I9, MA3(Bi0.5Sb0.5)2I9, and MA3Bi2I9 compounds came out to be 0.96, 0.92, and 0.88, respectively. Typically, a large tolerance factor value signifies a low formation energy which in turn addresses a thermodynamically favorable and stable phase.13 Hence our estimation indicated the formation of a more stable structure with antimony at the B-site. We may mention here that it is customary to consider the average effective ionic radius of Sb3+ and Bi3+ (RB = 89.5 pm) while calculating the tolerance factor in the substituted system, that is in the MA3(Sb0.5Bi0.5)2I9 composite.12
The structural characterization was then carried out through X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies and the respective patterns are presented in Fig. 3a and b. Typically, the two end-members, namely MA3Sb2I9 and MA3Bi2I9, crystallize in a zero-dimensional (0D) dimer-like structure with hexagonal symmetry (P63/mmc).2,18 The crystals are formed with isolated bioctahedral face-sharing (B2I9)3− clusters separated by MA+ groups; the clusters are analogous to quantum dots separated by ligands at the atomic level.25 The XRD patterns of MA3Sb2I9 thin-films showed the most intense peak at around 25° indicating a strong preferential growth along the (003) plane, i.e., the c-axis of the crystal. Such a pattern is in good agreement with the reported results for solution-processed MA3Sb2I9 films;2,11 only the peaks that could be indexed to P63/mmc were present in the diffraction pattern ensuring phase purity of the material. XRD patterns of the other end-member, namely MA3Bi2I9, also had a hexagonal symmetry and preferred growth along the (006) plane.26 The XRD patterns thus revealed a strong orientation of both the end-members in the [001] direction. This phase-invariance of the end-members further strengthens the occurrence of bandgap bowing in the MA3(Sb1−xBix)2I9 alloys as a quadratic evolution of the bandgap instead of two overlapping, linear, and Vegard-like behavior. XRD patterns of the intermediate compounds also showed a high preferential orientation of the crystallites along the same direction.

It is apparent that the hexagonal symmetry of MA3Sb2I9 and MA3Bi2I9 is retained in MA3(Sb1−xBix)2I9 solid state alloys. A closer inspection of the signature peak at ∼25° revealed a dopant-induced shift in the peak position implying a change in the lattice parameter (Fig. 3b). It may be recalled that in their trivalent cation form, bismuth has a larger effective ionic radius than that of antimony. Tensile strains are hence expected to form in MA3(Sb1−xBix)2I9 compounds upon bismuth-incorporation. As a result, introduction of bismuth enlarged the d-spacing in the composite and shifted the characteristic peak towards the smaller angle. It also appears from the patterns that the tensile strain may have saturated in MA3Bi2I9.
The XRD patterns were fitted using Pawley refinement to evaluate the lattice parameters of MA3(Sb1−xBix)2I9 (0 ≤ x ≤ 1) solid state alloys and the respective values have been collated in Table S1.† Considering the preferred orientation of the materials along the c-axis, we have studied the evolution of the respective lattice parameter (c) and unit cell volume with bismuth content in the composites (Fig. 4a and b). As can be seen from Fig. 4a, with increasing bismuth content, the c-parameter increased from a value of 21.458(2) Å, for pristine MA3Sb2I9 (x = 0), to 21.737(1) Å for MA3Bi2I9 (x = 1) owing to a larger effective ionic radius of Bi3+ as compared to Sb3+. As a result of the increase in the c-parameter, the volume of the unit cell also expanded continuously indicating an increase in unit cell parameters in MA3Sb2I9 crystals upon bismuth substitution (Fig. 4b).

As evidenced from our characterization, despite forming a completely miscible and compositionally homogeneous solid solution, alloys of MA3Sb2I9 and MA3Bi2I9 exhibited an unusual bandgap bowing behavior. The phenomenon of bandgap bowing is typically observed in disordered II–VI and III–V semiconductor alloys and recently has been reported in halide perovskites (MA(Sn1−xPbx)I3) as well.16,21,23 Unlike inorganic alloys, the underlying mechanism of bandgap bowing in hybrid perovskite alloys is not clearly known yet and has been proposed so far as a competing effect between spin–orbit coupling (SOC) and lattice distortion.16 As such, in the absence of a SOC effect, the optical bandgap of an alloy increases upon addition of an element having a higher effective ionic radius and the increase is expected to be linear following Vegard's law.27 On the other hand, as observed in MA(Sn1−xPbx)I3 solid solutions, inclusion of lead in MASnI3 introduces SOC into the system due to the high atomic number (Z) of lead and thereby lowers the bandgap of the alloys with increasing lead-content (x).16 At higher values of x, lattice distortion causes an increase in the bandgap overpowering the effect of SOC. Here the lattice distortion appears in the system due to a higher effective ionic radius (rion) of lead(II) as compared to that of tin(II) (the rion of Sn2+ and Pb2+ is 110 and 119 pm, respectively).16 This causes a change in the crystal symmetry and geometry of the structure resulting in a phase transition from the P4mm space group (α phase) of tin-rich compositions to the I4cm space group (β phase) of the lead-rich compositions.16
Based on the analysis of bandgap bowing in MASn1−xPbxI3, we speculate that SOC interactions would also appear in MA3(Sb1−xBix)2I9 with the introduction of a high-Z element (bismuth) replacing antimony and would cause a bandgap reduction with an increase in the bismuth-content (x) in the system. Since the effect of SOC is proportional to the fourth power of the atomic number of an element, we observed a sharp and linear red-shift of the bandgap with increasing bismuth-content in the MA3(Sb1−xBix)2I9 composition until x ≤ 0.5 (Fig. 1c). On the other hand, as observed from our XRD studies, the introduction of bismuth into such metal-substituted perovskite derivatives led to structural modifications (expansion of unit cell volume) due to the significant difference in the effective ionic radii of Sb3+ and Bi3+ (Fig. 4b); the latter having a larger ionic-radius, such structural change would widen the bandgap. We can therefore propose that like MA(Sn1−xPbx)I3, a competing effect of SOC and lattice strain existed in MA3(Sb1−xBix)2I9 solid state alloys and has resulted in the observed bandgap bowing. We expect that SOC effects dominate in antimony-rich compositions (x ≤ 0.5) leading to a gradual lowering of the bandgap and lattice distortion overpowered the proposed SOC effect in the bismuth rich compositions (0.5 < x ≤ 1.0) causing an increase in the bandgap. Further work, in particular theoretical calculations, should be done to corroborate the influence of SOC in this system.
2.2 Scanning tunneling spectroscopy: density of states and band edges
Though detailed electronic structure calculations are required to completely understand this anomalous bandgap bowing behavior in MA3(Sb1−xBix)2I9 perovskite derivatives, we aimed to get an insight into this phenomenon from scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS). To do so, we recorded tunneling current with respect to an applied voltage for all the compositions and calculated the differential tunnel conductance (dI/dV) that has a correspondence to the density of states (DOS) of the materials. During STS measurements, since the bias was applied to the tip with respect to the substrate, the conduction band (CB) and valence band (VB) edges could be identified in the form of first peaks in the dI/dV spectra appearing in the negative and positive tip voltages respectively, with Fermi energy (EF) being aligned to zero voltage (Fig. S1a†).28 The localized nature of the STS measurements was taken into account by recording tunneling current from a large number of points on each of the ultrathin films; with the CB and VB edges estimated from each measurement being collated in the form of histograms (Fig. S1b†), the band edge energies of MA3(Sb1−xBix)2I9 have been depicted in Fig. 5a and enlisted in Table S2.†
 Fig. 5  (a) CB and VB-edges as obtained from STS and (b) variation of the transport gap, optical bandgap, and exciton binding energy in MA3(Sb1−xBix)2I9 thin-films as a function of bismuth content (x). 
After determination of the band-edges, we estimated the transport gap in each of the MA3(Sb1−xBix)2I9 alloys (Table S2†). Similar to the optical bandgap, variation of the transport gap also showed a bowing effect with the gap of the MA3(Sb1−xBix)2I9 alloys being smaller than those of the end members. For each of the materials, the transport gap derived from STS studies was found to be wider than the corresponding optical bandgap and the difference in energy can be attributed to the exciton binding energy of the semiconductor.29 Although both the transport gap and optical bandgap in MA3(Sb1−xBix)2I9 exhibited the bowing effect with composition, their difference or exciton binding energy shows a monotonic increment with addition of bismuth into the system (Fig. 5b). As stated earlier, the exciton binding energy of MA3Sb2I9 is known to be less than that in MA3Bi2I9 due to a smaller spatial restriction and also a dielectric mismatch between the organic and inorganic layers.1 Hence, the trend obtained from our STS measurements was in agreement with the reported results.
If we consider the movement of the band edges during such an anomalous bandgap behavior, it can be seen that the shift of the CB-edge with composition has played a dominant role in the evolution of the transport gap. Movement of the VB-edge, conversely, was noticeable but marginal. Such a behavior can be understood by considering the composition of band edges in such lead-free hybrid perovskite derivatives. Since both antimony and bismuth, in their trivalent form, have similar electronic configurations (ns2) to bivalent lead, the composition of band edges in these perovskite derivatives is similar to the archetypical MAPbI3 perovskite.30 Hence, in MA3B2I9 compounds, the VB-edge is composed of iodine p (I 5p) with metal s (Sb 5 s or Bi 6 s) orbitals whereas the CB-edge is predominantly composed of metal p (Sb 5p or Bi 6p) orbitals, respectively, and they are confined zero-dimensionally in the (B2I9)3− bioctahedra where B = Sb or Bi.26 In accordance with such a band structure, the freshly introduced energy states of bismuth modulated the CB-edge of the MA3(Sb1−xBix)2I9 more than the VB-edge and in bismuth rich compositions, movement of both the edges away from the Fermi energy widened the bandgap. Such an evolution of the band-edge energies also nullifies the possibility of band inversion behind the bowing phenomenon. Goyal et al. proposed that bandgap bowing in MASn1−xPbxI3 solid solutions originates due to charge separation in the band-edges of the alloys.15 They argued that in all such alloys, the VB-edge inherits its character from the Sn s/I p combination whereas the CB-edge is derived from the Pb p/I p combination. The differences in the energies of Pb and Sn s and p orbitals eventually lead to a lower bandgap in the intermediates compared to the pure end members. However, if such a scenario is dominant in the bandgap bowing of MA3(Sb1−xBix)2I9 alloys, movement of the band-edges away from the Fermi energy after reaching their closest position cannot be justified. Since we have observed a bow-like evolution of the band-edges as well with respect to the composition of the alloys, it rules out the possibility of bandgap bowing due to band inversion. Besides locating the band-edges, information on the type of conductivity can also be gathered from STS measurements and corresponding DOS spectra. Typically, the MA3B2I9 perovskite derivatives processed through a solution-based approach have been reported to have p-type conductivity due to the presence of intrinsic acceptor type defects.26 Our STS results show that the VB-edge in MA3Sb2I9 is slightly closer to EF as compared to CB-edge inferring its p-type nature. Due to the isovalent nature of substitution in MA3(Sb1−xBix)2I9, the nature of conductivity was found to be unaffected over the entire range of bismuth-content; however its strength was stronger in bismuth-rich systems possibly due to a higher concentration of defects.
The non-monotonic evolution of the bandgap in MA3(Sb1−xBix)2I9 alloys is in contrast to the bandgap-tailoring in bismuth-doped MAPbBr3 crystals. Being a heterovalent dopant in the MAPbBr3 structure, bismuth led to a change in the type of conductivity; due to the presence of impurity energy levels within the bandgap of the host perovskite, such doping also resulted in bandgap narrowing in bismuth-doped MAPbBr3.31 However, in these alloys, the quadratic dependence of the bandgap on bismuth-content cannot be attributed to such defect-induced bandgap tailoring. Moreover, since defect states also contribute to tunneling current, the presence of defects influences the distribution of band-edge energies. As presented in Fig. S1b,† the FWHM of energy-histograms, which implies the distribution of band-energies, was quite narrow and showed a little or no change with an increase in bismuth-content. Therefore, we can infer that the defect-states induced by bismuth-doping do not play a prime role in the bandgap bowing of MA3(Sb1−xBix)2I9 alloys.
It has been proposed that the crystal potential in solid-state alloys varies aperiodically due to random variations in occupation of their metal sites by parent elements and this gives rise to the bandgap bowing phenomenon.32 This non-linear, quadratic to be specific, dependence of the bandgap on the composition of the alloys can be attributed to the fundamental difference in the electronic structure between the parent compounds, namely MA3Sb2I9 and MA3Bi2I9, resulting in a significant modification in the band structure of the former upon alloying with the latter.
As STS measurements have the ability to probe the local density of states (LDOS) of a semiconductor with a high spatial and energetic resolution, band energies obtained from STS studies refer to energy levels as “seen” by charge carriers in devices.28 We hence aimed to visualize the tentative band-alignment of MA3(Sb1−xBix)2I9 (0 ≤ x ≤ 1) with Cu:NiO and ZnO as carrier-selective contacts. As presented in Fig. 6, the band edges of representative compositions with x = 0.0, 0.5 and 1.0 formed type-II band-alignments both at Cu:NiO/MA3(Sb1−xBix)2I9 and MA3(Bi1−xSbx)2I9/ZnO interfaces ensuring hindrance free carrier transport in the devices for all the compositions.

2.3 Surface morphological and compositional studies
Morphology has been a long standing roadblock for solution-processed lead-free hybrid halide materials in achieving a promising photovoltaic performance.33,34 Due to the use of a single precursor based solution-approach during fabrication, MA3B2I9 and its derivatives are prone to form inhomogeneous films with incomplete coverage.10 An anti-solvent treatment during the fabrication of the films however addresses this concern to some extent by controlling the homogeneity and surface morphology of the films.11 Between the two commonly used anti-solvents, namely toluene and chlorobenzene, toluene promotes amorphous nature in the material.10 Hence, we intentionally refrained from its use and chose the latter. Images of films having representative bismuth-contents before and after anti-solvent treatment were recorded with a scanning electron microscope (SEM) and have been placed in Fig. S2.† It can be clearly observed from the comparison that the untreated films contained irregular-shaped crystals along with an extremely rough surface-morphology and incomplete substrate-coverage. Both parameters improve significantly after chlorobenzene treatment. The morphology of the treated films showed the presence of hexagonal-shaped crystals with micron-sized grains further ensuring a hexagonal crystal structure in these materials. It may be restated here that such a structure has already been confirmed from XRD studies.
We then proceeded to study the influence of bismuth-incorporation on the surface morphology of MA3(Sb1−xBix)2I9 films. Typical two-dimensional (2D) topographies of thin-films respective to each composition were recorded with an atomic force microscope (AFM) and have been shown in Fig. 7a. The images showed the formation of hexagonal crystals of comparable sizes over the entire range of bismuth-substitution.10,35 A closer inspection of each film however showed an island growth, i.e. the presence of small clusters of hexagons, on the films leading to the formation of an uneven surface-texture. The root-mean square (RMS) surface roughness of the films was calculated in the area of 10 × 10 μm2, by using the equipment's routine software. As evidenced from such estimation, the uniformity of the films could be seen to relatively improve with increasing bismuth-content in MA3(Sb1−xBix)2I9 (Fig. 7b). This indicates a relative improvement of grain size in the films formed with bismuth-rich compositions. The high surface roughness associated with all the MA3(Sb1−xBix)2I9 thin-films inferred an inherently non-uniform morphology of the films irrespective of the composition. Essentially, such an inhomogeneous nature is involved in the solution-based fabrication procedure of the films and a gaseous-phase deposition technique such as chemical vapor deposition could be used to achieve a better control on morphology and uniformity.36

To study the stoichiometry of the films, we carried out a quantitative compositional analysis through energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) measurements. Due to a non-uniform morphology of the films and localized nature of EDX measurements, we carried out EDX analysis at several locations on the films including both on the hexagons and the surface and also in films formed in different batches. Fig. S2b† shows the typical SEM images for the three representative compositions x = 0.0, 0.5 and 1.0 of MA3(Sb1−xBix)2I9 binary alloys where the points of EDX measurements have been marked with yellow dots. In Fig. S3† EDX patterns of the intermediate compound with x = 0.5 have been presented whereas the detailed relative analysis for all three composites has been appended in Table S3.† As can be seen from the compositional studies, hexagons in all the films expectedly showed a clear presence of the metal (antimony or bismuth or both) and iodine; in all cases, the antimony-to-bismuth ratio was close to the stoichiometry used during the material formation inferring compositional homogeneity and reproducibility of the as-prepared perovskite thin-films. However, the iodine-to-metal ratio was found to be less than the stoichiometry that can ascribed to the inherent limitations and poor reproducibility of EDX in quantifying iodine.37 Interestingly, the uniform regions also showed the presence of metal and iodine indicating the existence of a thin-layer of MA3(Sb1−xBix)2I9 covering the substrate. Thus, from EDX analysis, we could infer that the films were free of pin-holes and suitable to study their photovoltaic properties.
2.4 Photovoltaic characteristics
To study the influence of bandgap bowing on the photovoltaic properties of MA3(Sb1−xBix)2I9 binary perovskite derivatives, we fabricated and characterized planar heterojunction devices having an inverted geometry. In such devices, the MA3(Sb1−xBix)2I9 layer was sandwiched between Cu:NiO and ZnO hole- and electron-selective contacts, respectively. In Fig. 8a, we have presented I–V characteristics of devices based on some of the compositions, namely x = 0.0, 0.5, and 1.0, that is MA3Sb2I9, MA3(Sb0.5Bi0.5)2I9, and MA3Bi2I9 under dark and 1 sun illuminated conditions. With I–Vs of all the devices under 1 sun being collated in Fig. S4,† variation of power conversion efficiency (PCE) and short-circuit current density (JSC) with bismuth-content (x) has been presented in Fig. 8b. The respective photovoltaic parameters of all devices have been summed up in Table 1. From the characteristics, the JSC of the devices could be seen to increase continuously from 2.76 mA cm−2 for MA3Sb2I9 (x = 0) based devices to a maximum value of 3.58 mA cm−2 with materials having an intermediate content of bismuth. With bismuth-rich compositions, the JSC value of the devices decreased; that is, the JSC also showed a bowing-nature in accordance with the bandgap dependence of the materials and the highest JSC was yielded for the lowest bandgap material.

In general, VOC in perovskite solar cells is governed by the energy-difference between the CB-edge of the perovskite layer and the VB-edge of the hole-selective contact.38 As found in the STS measurements and respective density of states (DOS) spectra, introduction of Bi3+ into the MA3Sb2I9 structure specially influenced the CB-edge, and accordingly modulated the VOC value of the devices. Considering the wide bandgap of MA3B2I9 perovskite derivatives, the reported VOC values are still low indicating a high VOC-loss in the devices due to both the large exciton binding energy of the materials and significant degree of carrier recombination in the devices.2,18,35 The low VOC in our devices can be similarly explained.
While an estimation of exciton binding energy has already been made from transport gap and optical bandgap measurements (Fig. 5b), the fill-factor in solar cells is indicative of the recombination phenomena in the devices. Although, the fill-factor of the devices improved upon bismuth substitution, the generally low values (Table 1) signify a high degree of trap-assisted recombination in the devices.
As a cumulative effect of all the parameters, the PCE of the devices was optimized to a value of ∼1% at x = 0.6. The value is superior to those of devices with both the end-members, namely MA3Sb2I9 (PCE = 0.81%) and MA3Bi2I9 (PCE = 0.78%). An optimum balance between the bandgap, surface roughness, and exciton binding energy in MA3(Sb1−xBix)2I9 with x = 0.6 composition can be the reason behind the feat. However, the observed PCE parameter is significantly lower than that of the standard MAPbI3 perovskite solar cells that can be attributed to high effective masses of the carriers along the c-axis, poor surface morphology of these lead-free perovskite derivatives, and a non-optimal bandgap.39
3. Conclusions
In conclusion, we have systematically studied the effect of bismuth substitution in MA3Sb2I9 perovskite-derivatives that evidenced a bowing behavior in the bandgap. Such a non-linear dependence of the bandgap on the composition of MA3(Sb1−xBix)2I9 solid solutions led to the achievement of a bandgap of 1.90 eV at an intermediate composition (x = 0.5) which is lower than the bandgap of both the pure end-members MA3Sb2I9 (2.36 eV, x = 0.0) and MA3Bi2I9 (2.16 eV, x = 1.0). STS measurements and thereby DOS spectra, yielding CB and VB-edges of the compounds, have also evidenced the bowing phenomenon in the transport gap of MA3(Sb1−xBix)2I9 solid state alloys. By estimating optical and transport gaps at different compositions, we have derived exciton binding energies, which could be seen to increase continuously with increasing bismuth content. The bowing behavior in the bandgap could be due to a combined effect of spin–orbit coupling (SOC) and structural modifications which were introduced into the MA3Sb2I9 system due to the inclusion of high-Z element bismuth. Calculations would however be required to confirm the role of SOC. The planar heterojunction (p–i–n) devices based on MA3(Sb1−xBix)2I9 showed type-II band-alignment at both the interfaces with carrier-selective layers (namely p–i and i–n) and exhibited solar cell characteristics. Interestingly, the performance of the devices, when plotted as a function of bismuth-content, exhibited a dependence on the change in the bandgap, morphology, and exciton binding energy and yielded a PCE of ∼1% in these zero-dimensional lead-free hybrid halide perovskite derivatives.
4. Methods
4.1 Materials
Methylammonium iodide (CH3NH3I) was purchased from M s−1 Dyesol Australia Pty. Ltd. Antimony(III) iodide (98%; SbI3), bismuth(III) iodide (99%; BiI3), chlorobenzene (anhydrous, 99.8%), copper(II) chloride dihydrate (ACS reagent, ≥99.0%; CuCl2·2H2O), diethanolamine (reagent grade, ≥98.0%; HN(CH2CH2OH)2) nickel(II) acetate tetrahydrate (purum p.a., ≥99.0%; Ni(OCOCH3)2·4H2O), ethylene glycol (for analysis ≥ 99.5%; C2H5OH), methanol (for HPLC, ≥99.9%, CH3OH) and N,N-dimethylformamide (anhydrous 99.8%; DMF) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, Inc. Zinc acetate dihydrate (extra pure, 99.5%; Zn(OCOCH3)2·2H2O) and potassium hydroxide pellets (extra pure, 85%, KOH) were purchased from Loba Chemie Pvt. Ltd. The materials, which were sensitive to moisture and ambient conditions, were stored in a nitrogen filled glovebox to prevent degradation. All the chemicals were used without further purification or treatment.
4.2 Fabrication of MA3(Sb1−xBix)2I9 thin-films
MA3(Sb1−xBix)2I9 (0 ≤ x ≤ 1) thin-films were fabricated under ambient conditions by following a reported solution-based single-precursor approach40 assisted by an anti-solvent treatment.11 Briefly, 0.4 M methylammonium iodide and 0.3 M metal iodide, namely BiI3 and SbI3 with a stoichiometric ratio between 0.0 and 1.0 in a step of 0.1, were mixed in 1 mL of anhydrous N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and stirred overnight at 70 °C under ambient conditions to form a precursor solution of vermilion color. The solution was then spun onto preconditioned substrates at 2500 rpm for 30 s; during the twelfth second of the coating, the films were washed with ∼100 μL of warm (70 °C) chlorobenzene (HPLC-grade) for fast deposition crystallization (FDC) of the material. The films were then annealed at 100 °C for half an hour to complete the film formation and crystallization processes.
4.3 Fabrication of Cu:NiO thin-films and surface modified ZnO nanoparticles
The Cu:NiO thin-films and surface-modified ZnO nanoparticles were synthesized following reported solution based approaches.41,42 For example, Cu:NiO thin-films were formed through a conventional sol–gel reaction route, where the sol was prepared by mixing 0.4 M nickel(II) acetate tetrahydrate with 5 at% copper(II) chloride (as the dopant) in 10 mL methanol at room temperature. After complete dissolution of the materials, 0.8 mL of diethanolamine was added dropwise under stirring conditions to prepare the gel. The precursor was then spun on the substrates and subsequently annealed at 425 °C in air to form the films.
ZnO nanoparticles, on the other hand, were grown by following a typical hydrolysis route. In brief, the zinc precursor solution was first prepared by dissolving 0.04 M zinc acetate dihydrate in 10 mL ethylene glycol at 80 °C until a homogeneous and transparent solution was obtained. To oxidize, a 0.04 M solution of KOH in 10 mL ethylene glycol was dropwise added into the solution of zinc until turbidity appears in the sol indicating the formation of ZnO nanoparticles. The solution was then sonicated for 30 min followed by addition of 0.1 mL of oleic acid for surface modification of the as-prepared nanoparticles. They were then collected by centrifugation at 8000 rpm for 15 min, sifted through a syringe filter, and redispersed in chlorobenzene for further application.
4.4 Characterization of materials
The materials were characterized by UV-vis optical absorption spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies. The measurements were carried out with a Shimadzu UV-2550 spectrophotometer and Rigaku MINIFLEX 600 X-ray Diffractometer (Cu Kα1,2 radiation), respectively. The surface morphology of the films was recorded with a Nanosurf Easyscan2 atomic force microscope (AFM) in non-contact mode and Jeol JSM-5600 scanning electron microscope (SEM). Compositional analyses of the materials were carried out from energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDXA) using an Oxford Inca EDX system attached to the SEM. The materials were further probed with a Nanosurf Easyscan2 scanning tunneling microscope (STM) under ambient conditions. From the tunneling current versus tip voltage characteristics, differential tunnel conductance (dI/dV) spectra that have a correspondence to the density of states (DOS) of the materials were derived, enabling us to locate the conduction and valence band (CB and VB, respectively) edges of the semiconductors. Ultrathin-films required for characterization in an STM were formed on n-type silicon wafers (arsenic-doped) having a resistivity of 3–10 mΩ cm as a substrate electrode. The films for STS measurements were cast at a higher speed (rpm) from the same stock solutions. During the measurements, voltage was applied to the tip, which was formed through a mechanical cut of a Pt/Ir (80:20) wire having a diameter of 0.25 mm. For approach of the tip, a bias of +2.0 V was applied through a feedback loop to achieve a set current of 1 nA.
4.5 Fabrication of devices
Solar cells were fabricated under ambient conditions. Indium tin oxide (ITO) coated glass substrates were first cleaned through a usual protocol followed by ultraviolet-ozone (UVO) treatment for 20 min. As a hole-transport layer (HTL), copper-doped nickel(II) oxide (Cu:NiO) thin-films were formed following the sol–gel reaction route. The process was repeated until a film-thickness of ∼40 nm was achieved. The HTL-coated substrates were then subjected to preheating at 70 °C for 10 min. The perovskite layer (∼125 nm thick) was then formed following the process described above. As an electron-transport layer (ETL), ZnO was spun at 3000 rpm for 30 s from a chlorobenzene solution (20 mg mL−1), followed by annealing at 100 °C for 20 min. The thickness of the ZnO layer was optimized to around 25 nm. To complete the device fabrication process, substrates were then transferred to a vacuum chamber where aluminum strips, orthogonal to the ITO ones, were thermally evaporated to form top electrodes (100 nm thick). The active area of the cells was 10 mm2.
4.6 Characterization of devices
Current–voltage (I–V) characteristics of the devices under dark and 1 sun illumination conditions were recorded with a Keithley 2636A electrometer using LabTracer software. The measurements were carried out under the inert environment of a glove box. Three-axis micropositioners having pressure-loaded spring probe contacts were used to connect the electrodes of the devices to the electrometer. A 300 W solar simulator (Newport-Oriel Sol3A) attached with an AM1.5 filter placed outside the glove box acted as a source for illumination through the transparent base of the glove box. While recording I–V characteristics under an illumination condition, regions outside the cell under probe were covered to avoid any possible contributions from neighboring areas or devices.
