    , Accepted 24th June 2021First published on 12th July 2021AbstractThe high cost and limited availability of the precious metal catalysts required for catalysing the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in metal–air batteries restrict the marketing of these clean energy technologies. Understanding the OER and ORR mechanisms and identifying a catalyst design principle that connects the properties of materials with catalytic activity can speed up the search for highly active and abundant metal-oxide catalysts to replace costly platinum. In this report, the OER and ORR mechanisms involving a redox cycle of LaNi1−xFexO3 perovskite-oxide catalysts for the zinc–air battery (ZAB) in alkaline media are presented. Here, we demonstrate that the electrocatalytic activity toward OER/ORR of LaNi1−xFexO3 catalysts is primarily correlated with their reduction rate (logυred,25), such as the shape of a volcano. In addition, the OER/ORR activities of rapidly oxidized catalysts (LaNi1−xFexO3, where x = 0.5, 0.7, 0.9) and rapidly reduced catalysts (LaNi1−xFexO3, where x = 0, 0.1, 0.3) are linearly associated with their reduction rates and oxidation rates, respectively. The Tafel plot and temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) analyses suggest that the activation of OH, a charge transfer from the catalyst, is a rate-determining step, which implies that the rapidly oxidized catalyst and rapidly reduced catalyst control the rate of OER and ORR redox cycles, respectively. Furthermore, the LaNi0.5Fe0.5O3 catalyst appearing high on the volcano-shaped plot exhibits high OER/ORR activities, and thus highlights the importance of the electronic structure in controlling the perovskite-oxide catalytic activity.
1. Introduction
The demand for energy is increasing day by day in the modern society, and finding alternative sources of energy to fossil fuels is a necessary step towards low-carbon economy and reducing environmental pollution. Recently, renewable energy sources such as geothermal, hydroelectric, biomass, wind and solar have been increasingly utilized. However, these energy sources are mainly constrained by climate conditions, site-specific nature and the high cost of the large-scale operation. Consequently, finding a safe, reliable and efficient way to store energy from these renewable sources is extremely needed. Electrochemical energy conversion and storage technologies, such as batteries with high power density, are the key energy-storage devices for the next generation of electronics, green vehicles and residential distribution systems.1,2 Thus, batteries have always been of significant interest in the electronics market, transportation sector and academia in order to reduce emissions from fossil fuels. During the last few decades, a series of rechargeable batteries have been widely explored, investigated and demonstrated.3–6 Among the various types of batteries, metal–air batteries (MABs) are considered as the most promising power conversion devices and clean energy storages for portable devices, electric vehicles, industrial and residential applications. On the other hand, MABs have the highest theoretical specific energy density among all rechargeable battery types.7 This is due to the use of oxygen in air as an active material at the cathode, enabling a substantial reduction in the cathode size and overall weight of the battery.8 The anode material used for a MAB is a metal, such as zinc (Zn), aluminium (Al), magnesium (Mg), lithium (Li), iron (Fe) and calcium (Ca). Among the common types of MABs, zinc–air batteries (ZABs) are the most practically viable choice. They possess some unique features, such as the huge natural abundance of zinc metal, low cost, environmental friendliness, high theoretical energy density, and electropositivity that indicates relative stability in aqueous and alkaline solutions without significant corrosion.9 As a promising technology, rechargeable ZABs have gained tremendous interest over the past few years. They have undergone very rapid development, and have been considered as the next-generation electrochemical energy-storage devices due to the high theoretical energy density. It has a theoretical specific energy density of 1086 W h kg−1, which is 2.5 times higher than that of the Li-ion battery.10 Moreover, the appropriate operating voltage of ZAB is ca. 1.65 V, which is not too high to induce the decomposition of water in the electrolyte.11 ZABs are composed of three main components: a Zn anode, an alkaline electrolyte (usually concentrated KOH) and an air cathode (a carbon substrate with a catalytic layer). The air electrode is divided into two layers: a gas diffusion layer (GDL) and a catalytic layer. Typically, upon discharge, the Zn metal is oxidized to Zn(OH)42− at the anode (negative electrode). Supersaturation of Zn(OH)42− results in the formation of ZnO, as is shown by the reaction (1). At the cathode (positive electrode), O2 diffuses through the GDL due to the pressure differences between the outside and inside of the cell. Oxygen is reduced at the surface of the electrocatalyst, as shown in reaction (2). A three-phase reaction (gas–liquid–solid) is the major process in the cathode of a ZAB. During discharge, the catalyst (solid) accelerates the reduction of O2 (gas) to hydroxyl ions in the electrolyte (liquid). During charge, O2 evolves at the positive electrode, and Zn is electroplated at the negative electrode to complete the cell. The main electrochemical reactions occurring at the anode and cathode surface under an alkaline electrolyte through consecutive processes are as follows:12 Anode: Zn(s) + 4OH(aq)− ⇆ [Zn(OH)4](aq)2− + 2e− ⇆ ZnO(s) + H2O(aq) + 2OH(aq)− + 2e−(1) Cathode: 1/2O2(g) + H2O(aq) + 2e− ⇆ 2OH(aq)−(2) Overall reaction: Zn(s) + 1/2O2(g) ⇆ ZnO(s) (E0 = 1.65 Vvs. RHE)(→discharge, ←charge)(3)
Here, RHE denotes reversible hydrogen electrode, and the reversible potential for ZABs is 1.65 V. However, the actual voltage drop may occur (less than 1.40 V) depending on the applied current density. Takeguchi et al.13 reported that the cause of the voltage drop is mainly due to a high overpotential at the air electrode during charging and discharging processes. The increased overpotential resulted in a reduced efficiency of the charging and discharging reactions. They also reported that the overall performance of ZAB greatly depends on a pair of sluggish reaction rates at the cathode, i.e., the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) that govern the charging and discharging processes, respectively.14,15 To assess the charge/discharge performance, the kinetics of OER and ORR are considered the most important factor in electrochemical reactions, as indicated below. Charge (OER): 2OH− → 1/2O2 + H2O + 2e−(4) Discharge (ORR): 1/2O2 + H2O + 2e− → 2OH−(5)It has been reported that the kinetics of the cathode reaction is slow because of the highly irreversible ORR and mixed potential that can eventually lead to potential loss, resulting in a reduction of the OER/ORR performance.16 To improve the kinetics and stability of OER/ORR, precious metals as electrocatalysts need to be used more efficiently. Meanwhile, considerable efforts have been devoted to identify alternative electrocatalysts to alleviate issues concerning the slow reaction kinetics of the OER and ORR. Pt-Based electrocatalysts are very active for ORR, but the OER activity is limited by the formation of an oxide layer at high potentials. Conversely, ruthenium (Ru) or iridium (Ir)-based electrocatalysts are effective for OER, but not as active as Pt for ORR.17 These issues, along with the poor stability, high cost and shortage of precious metals represent a high challenge for practical applications of ZABs on a large scale. Therefore, the development of a high performance, non-precious metal electrocatalyst with simultaneous OER and ORR activity (bifunctional) is crucially needed as an alternative to precious metals.18 Perovskite oxides are one such promising family of multifunctional materials that possess catalytic activity toward the OER/ORR, and thus have been used widely in fuel cells and electrolyzers, along with MABs.19,20 The general chemical formula of perovskite is ABO3, where A is usually a rare-earth or alkaline earth metal and B is a transition metal. As a new class in the mixed-metal oxide family, perovskites with a large variety of elemental compositions and different crystal structures can be achieved through the A-site/B-site cation substitution or deficiency creation in these sites, which confers the perovskite with a new formula of AaA′1−aBbB′1−bO3−x. These materials allow for tuning the structure and property by changing the symmetry of the crystal, which can be achieved either by doping A or B sites with heteroatoms or creating O2 vacancies. Moreover, perovskites can be synthesized easily with relatively low-cost. Among various types of perovskites, the cost-effective perovskite oxide catalysts such as LaNiO3,21 LaCoO3,22 SrCoO3−δ,23 Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3−δ,24 PrBaCo2O5+δ,25 and LaSr3Fe3O10 (ref. 26) exhibit high activities toward OER/ORR in alkaline media. However, their electrocatalytic activities are poorly understood, and still inefficient compared to those of the state-of-the-art catalysts. Hence, the rational design and development of a highly active and stable catalyst is required, and it is obviously important to identify the factors necessary for a better understanding of the catalytic reaction mechanisms, which can assist in further improving the catalytic activity.
Meanwhile, correlation studies between the catalytic activities and electronic structures of perovskites in alkaline media for OER/ORR have identified several factors, including the d-electron number,27 oxygen binding strength,28 formation of the σ*-band with electrons, eg occupancy of the transition metal cation,29 transition metal–oxygen covalence, and bonding of oxygenated intermediates at the surface. As reported previously,30,31 the OER processes in alkaline media consist of several steps. The reaction pathways can vary depending on different catalysts utilized as well. During the OER process, it is known that the metal–hydroxide (M–OH) bonding strength plays a key role in determining the reaction kinetics and overall electrocatalytic efficiency.32 Feng et al.33 reported that the OER activity of perovskites is related to the number of electrons in the eg-orbital based on the crystal field theory, and eg = 1 can be regarded as an indicator of high OER activities for perovskite. Moreover, the ORR process in the alkaline media consists of a series of electrochemical reactions, which involve several steps of electron-transfer processes. The ORR reaction mechanisms for perovskite-oxide catalysts are characterized by either a four-electron (4e−)34 or two-electron (2e−) pathway.35 Previously proposed OER/ORR reaction mechanisms for the perovskite-oxide catalysts in alkaline media are summarized in Table 1.

As mentioned above, along with the experimental parameters, the OER/ORR mechanisms can also be different due to different chemical compositions, crystal structures and electronic structures of the perovskite oxide catalysts. Therefore, a good understanding of the mechanisms of both OER and ORR reactions in rechargeable ZABs is critically important in terms of the further design and synthesis of perovskite oxide catalysts as a new class of highly active and stable catalysts for energy storage and conversion devices. However, relatively little is known about the mechanisms of the OER/ORR reactions on perovskite oxide catalysts in alkaline media. Herein, we discuss systematically the synthesis and electrochemical analysis of such bifunctional perovskite oxide catalysts, namely LaNi1−xFexO3, where x = 0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7 and 0.9. The structure, morphology and composition of the synthesized LaNi1−xFexO3 are characterized, and studied in order to clarify the underlying mechanisms of these materials. The OER/ORR catalytic activities of LaNi1−xFexO3 in alkaline media are also characterized, and then the substituent effects are discussed. In addition, the OER/ORR mechanisms are thoroughly evaluated using Tafel slopes and temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) slope analysis. In this study, we propose OER/ORR mechanisms with redox cycles of perovskite oxide catalysts for the rapidly oxidized LaNi1−xFexO3 (x = 0.5, 0.7, 0.9) and the rapidly reduced LaNi1−xFexO3 (x = 0, 0.1, 0.3) catalysts in alkaline media. To determine the reaction kinetics of the rate-determining step (RDS) for the OER and ORR redox cycles, the experimentally obtained anodic transfer coefficient and cathodic transfer coefficient are used. For the OER/ORR redox cycles, it is found that the chemical redox reactions and RDS of a reaction are equal. This assumption is supported by the consistency of the results of the Tafel slopes and TPR slopes. Consequently, the kinetics of the chemical activation reactions of OH becomes the RDS for the OER/ORR redox cycles. It implies that the chemical reduction of the rapidly oxidized catalysts and the chemical oxidation of the rapidly reduced catalysts can control the rate of the OER/ORR redox cycles, respectively.
Consequently, the novelty of this article is not only the contribution of a better understanding of the mechanisms of OER/ORR and guidance for the design of efficient perovskite oxides-based catalysts, but also the LaNi1−xFexO3 used as a model system for this study, which had never been studied to a great extent (both theoretical and experimental aspects) before. In addition, with regard to the cost-effectiveness and wide application possibilities in fuel cells, the LaNi1−xFexO3 catalyst is of considerable importance both from a scientific and engineering point of view. Therefore, our study intended to provide a better understanding of the OER/ORR catalytic activity of the LaNi1−xFexO3 catalyst in the ZAB environment.
2. Experimental
2.1 Chemicals and reagents
Lanthanum(III) nitrate hexahydrate (La(NO3)3·6H2O, 100%), nickel(II) nitrate hexahydrate (Ni(NO3)2·6H2O, 98%), iron(III) nitrate nonahydrate (Fe(NO3)3·9H2O, 99%), citric acid (C6H8O7, 98%), ethylene glycol (C2H6O2, 99.5%), and tetrahydrofuran (C4H8O, 99.5%) were all purchased from Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd. Potassium hydroxide (KOH, 99.99%), Nafion (5 wt%), and sodium hydroxide (NaOH, 99.99%) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich, and acetylene black (AB) purchased from Strem Chemicals was used as carbon black. The ultrapure deionized water (Milli-Q Co. Ltd.) used herein has a resistivity of 18.0 MΩ cm. All of the above-mentioned chemicals were analytical grade, and were used without further purification.
2.2 Catalyst synthesis
For comparison, a series of LaNi1−xFexO3 (x = 0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9) perovskite oxides were synthesized using the sol–gel method, and these perovskite oxides were used as cathode catalysts for ZABs. For the doped samples, the molar percentages of Fe(NO3)3·9H2O compared with Ni(NO3)2·6H2O were 0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7 and 0.9, respectively, in both composites. The total amount of cations (La3+, Ni2+ and Fe3+) was set at 0.01 mol L−1, and fixed to the negatively charged surface of the transition metal nitrates. Briefly, La(NO3)3·6H2O, Ni(NO3)2·6H2O, and Fe(NO3)3·9H2O with the respective stoichiometric ratios were dissolved in 40 mL deionized water at 60 °C. Next, 0.02 mol of citric acid was gradually added to the transparent solution of metal nitrates under vigorous agitation. The resulting mixture was stirred well at 60 °C for 2 h to obtain a stable solution of citric acid–metal complexes. After the addition of 0.02 mol ethylene glycol (1.11 g cm−3) to the complex citric acid–metal solution, the mixture was heated to 90 °C for 5 h to speed up the polyesterification reaction, and evaporate the excess water until a homogeneous gel was obtained. Then, the gel was dried at 100 °C for 3 h. A dry mass of the mixture was initially calcined at 450 °C for 2 h, and then heated to 1000 °C for 6 h to obtain the targeted samples. The rate of heating and cooling were 5 °C min−1 and 3 °C min−1, respectively. Finally, the obtained samples were ground into more fine powders using a mortar and pestle. The schematic process of the catalyst synthesis is illustrated in Fig. 1.
 Fig. 1  Schematic diagram of the catalyst synthesis process. 
2.3 Physical characterization
The structural and phase characterizations of the LaNi1−xFexO3 perovskite-oxide were conducted by X-ray diffraction (XRD). The XRD patterns were recorded on a RINT-2200 (Rigaku Corp.) using Cu Kα (λ = 1.5418 Å) radiation operated at 40 kV and 30 mA. The sweep range of 2θ was 20° to 80° with a sweep rate of 2° s−1. The morphology and composition of the perovskite-oxide catalysts were studied by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM; JEOL JSM-7001F) equipped with an energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDX). The accelerating voltage and working distance were 10 kV and 10 mm, respectively. Specific surface areas were determined by Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) analysis of the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms measured on the samples, using the automatic BELSORP mini. The samples were pre-heated to 200 °C in vacuum during the night. Then, TPR analysis was performed on a Seiko EXSTAR SII TG/DTA 7200 to determine the reduction and oxidation (redox) properties of the perovskite-oxide catalysts. Prior to the TRP experiment, a 100 ± 5 mg sample was pre-treated in 5 vol% O2/Ar stream at 200 °C for 2 h to obtain completely oxidized perovskite catalysts. After cooling to room temperature (RT), a stream of Ar gas was purged into the reactor for 20 min to create an inert atmosphere. Subsequently, the catalysts were heated at 800 °C for 20 min under H2/Ar (5% H2) atmosphere. The experimental conditions for a TPR test were a gas flow rate of 50 mL min−1 and a heating rate of 3 °C min−1.
2.4 Electrode preparation
The working electrodes supported on glassy carbon (GC, Pine instrument) disk electrodes with an area of 0.196 cm2 were prepared in accordance with the procedure reported by Suntivich et al.21 Before each experiment, the GC was smoothed successively to obtain a mirror finish using 0.05 μm alumina slurry on a microcloth (Buehler). Next, a small amount of acetylene black carbon (AB, STREM Chemicals) was added as a conductive additive to effectively remove the formation of impurity phases and low conductivity. Before application, AB carbon was pre-treated by nitric acid at 80 °C for 12 h, followed by successive filtration of the precipitate and washed thoroughly with DW to remove the acid residue, and then dried at 100 °C overnight. Nafion solution (0.924 g mL−1) was then used as a catalyst binder. Prior to this, Nafion solution was neutralized with 0.1 M NaOH solution using a volume ratio of 2:1. To prepare a homogenous catalyst ink, a uniform mixture of an oxide (5 mgoxide mLink−1), AB (1 mgAB mLink−1) and Na+-exchanged Nafion solution (1 mgNafion mLink−1) was suspended in 5 mL of tetrahydrofuran, and the suspension was ultrasonicated for 1 h in an ice bath. A 10 μL of the ink was dropped-cast on a GC disk electrode, and then dried in ambient air for at least 30 min. The final compositions of the electrode materials were 250 μgoxide cmdisk−2, 50 μgAB cmdisk−2 and 50 μgNafion cmdisk−2.
2.5 Electrochemical measurements
The electrochemical measurements were conducted using a Solartron 1280C programmable potentiostat and a rotator (Ametek 636A, Princeton Applied Research) in a standard three electrode Teflon (PTFE) cell equipped with a Pt-wire counter electrode (CE), an Hg/HgO reference electrode (RE) and a GC-disk working electrode (WE). A rotating disk electrode (RDE) was used as WE in the three-electrode system. All RDE measurements in this study were conducted in 0.1 mol KOH solution at RT. First of all, a 0.1 M KOH solution of 100 mL used as electrolyte was freshly prepared from ultrapure deionized water and KOH prior to each measurement. Next, the RE was filled, and then calibration was performed with the same electrolyte by performing hydrogen oxidation/evolution currents on the Pt plate using the RDE. The zero current potential was determined as the RHE potential, and 0 V vs. RHE corresponds to 0.900 V vs. RE in this study. All the measured potentials were calibrated at the RHE potential scale, and iR compensated because of the error correction. The non-compensated ohmic resistance of the electrolyte (≈40 Ω) was determined by the impedance test of the same electrolyte. Before electrochemical measurements, the oxygen dissolved in the 0.1 M KOH electrolyte was eliminated by argon at a rate of 200 cm3 min−1 for 30 min because the oxygen dissolved in the electrolyte has a significant impact on the Zn anode. Afterwards, the prepared electrodes were conditioned in an aging process of 10 cycles between 0.03 and 1.2 V vs. RHE with a scan rate of 0.03 V s−1 due to the cleaning of the catalyst surfaces. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) measurements were carried out to assess the OER and ORR activities of the prepared catalysts. The background currents of the ORR activity were measured at 0.01 V s−1 from 1.2 V to 0.3 V with the rotation speeds of 100, 400, 900 and 1600 rpm, respectively. Subsequently, the electrolyte was saturated with oxygen at a flow rate of 200 cm3 min−1 for 30 min. The OER activities were measured in an O2 atmosphere at a sweep rate of 0.01 V s−1 from 1.2 V to 1.8 V at 1600 rpm. Subsequently, the ORR activities were assessed at 0.01 V s−1 from 1.2 V to 0.3 V at rotational speeds similar to those of the background measurements.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Structural, morphological and compositional properties

Fig. 2(a) shows the XRD patterns of LaNi1−xFexO3 (x = 0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9) perovskite catalysts synthesized by the sol–gel method. As shown in the figure, almost similar diffraction peaks are observed for all samples. All samples exhibit the obvious peaks that can be attributed to the well crystallized perovskite structure. Samples with 0.5 ≤ x ≤ 0.9 compositions show an orthorhombic structure, while the composition with x = 0.1 reveals a rhombohedral structure similar to undoped LaNiO3 (rhombohedral crystal structure with Rc symmetry, PDF card no. 34-1028). The crystal structures change from rhombohedral (when x is 0.1) to the orthorhombic phase when x is greater than 0.5. However, both rhombohedral and orthorhombic phases are observed in the case of LaNi0.5Fe0.5O3. These results are in good agreement with those reported in the literature.42

In order to clarify the doping effects of Fe on the surface morphology of the prepared catalysts, SEM observation was carried out. Fig. 2(b)–(d) shows the SEM images of the representative samples because of the morphological similarities of the LaNi1−xFexO3 perovskite oxide catalysts. The particle size distributions derived from various samples range from several tens of nanometres to several micrometres. As shown in the figures, the average grain size of the Fe-doped LaNi1−xFexO3 perovskite-oxide catalysts increases with increasing doping level. In fact, particle agglomeration is more pronounced at a higher doping concentration in perovskite-oxide catalysts. The particle size determined by the SEM image analysis is reasonably consistent with the values derived from the XRD measurements. The estimated size of the catalyst particles is described in more detail in the following section. It should be noted that the size of the prepared catalysts is comparatively larger than conventional catalysts, and that a normally significantly higher carbon content is necessary to avoid the pronounced contact resistance. Here, we also use a carbon additive for better contact. Indeed, the understanding of the OER/ORR mechanisms focuses mainly on observing the potential behaviour rather than current density in this study.
For quantitative presentation of the LaNi1−xFexO3 components, EDX measurements were conducted. The result showed that the Ni/La, Fe/La and O/La ratios are near the theoretical atomic ratios. The average composition shows remarkably good agreement between the atomic ratios and the nominal chemical composition. Moreover, a drastic change in the Ni ratio is observed for the highest Fe-doped LaNi0.1Fe0.9O3, which may be due to the leaching out of NiO from the material surface. This result suggests that Fe-doping can suppress the formation of NiO on the surface of LaNiO3.43 However, numerous reports have pointed out that the existence of NiO on the surface may block active sites, resulting in an increase in Ni+3 at the surface that is beneficial to improve both OER and ORR activity.21,44 In addition, the specific surface area (BET surface area) of the catalysts was determined using N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms. In fact, there is no significant difference between the particle size and the BET surface of the doped oxides. The results of the bulk compositions obtained by EDX, the particle size distribution obtained by SEM, the crystalline structure obtained by XRD and the specific surface area determined by BET are summarized in Table 2.

3.2 Electrochemical properties
Electrochemical properties of the LaNi1−xFexO3 (x = 0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9) catalysts supported on AB carbon were investigated by LSV tests on a RDE in O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH electrolyte at a scanning rate of 0.01 V s−1.21 The OER and ORR polarization curves of the prepared catalysts were measured in the potential ranges from 1.2 V to 1.8 V for OER, and from 1.2 V to 0.3 V for ORR in order to better understand the electrocatalytic activities, as shown in Fig. 3. Activities of carbon AB for ORR and OER are negligible compared to the perovskite catalysts examined in this study.
 Fig. 3  (a) OER polarization curves of LaNi1−xFexO3 (x = 0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7 and 0.9) perovskite oxides, RuO2, IrO2 and AB carbon, and (b) ORR polarization curves of LaNi1−xFexO3 (x = 0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7 and 0.9) perovskite oxides, Pt/C and AB carbon with a sweep rate of 0.01 V s−1 at the electrode rotating speed of 1600 rpm in O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH electrolyte. 
The measured OER current densities were corrected with respect to capacitance by averaging the forward and backward scans in the OER kinetic region, and iR-corrected, as shown in Fig. 3(a). Among the catalysts measured, LaNi0.5Fe0.5O3 has the lowest OER onset potential (ca. 1.62 V vs. RHE) at a current density of 1 mA cmdisk−2, indicating its highest electrocatalytic performance for the OER reaction. Moreover, LaNiO3 shows a higher overpotential (approximately, 1.66 V vs. RHE) at a current density of 1 mA cmdisk−2 compared to that of the doped oxides, suggesting that the presence of Fe in the structure of LaNiO3 has a positive effect on the OER activity of the doped oxides. As a result, it can be concluded that the excellent activity of OER can possibly be attributed to the increased number of active sites, improved conductivity, and intrinsic activity induced by Fe doping. It may also suggest that the gain size increases with the increasing amount of Fe concentration that plays a major role in their catalytic activity.

Fig. 3(b) shows the ORR polarization curves of the LaNi1−xFexO3 catalysts measured by LSV on a RDE in the O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH electrolyte at a scanning rate of 0.01 V s−1 and a constant rotation speed of 1600 rpm. Catalyst ORR activities were derived from negative potential scans in the ORR kinetic region, and capacitive currents were corrected in the Ar-saturated electrolyte. The iR-correction was performed by considering the total cell resistance. As shown in Fig. 3(b), the LaNi0.5Fe0.5O3 catalyst exhibits the most positive onset potential of ca. 0.57 V vs. RHE at 2 mA cmdisk−2, and remarkably high ORR activity when compared with other oxides. In addition, the ORR current density of LaNi0.5Fe0.5O3 is approximately 4.2 mA cmdisk−2 at 0.4 V vs. RHE, while the ORR current density for the LaNiO3 catalyst is ca. 3.0 mA cmdisk−2, which is far more negative. Therefore, it could be said that LaNi1−xFexO3 is capable not only of catalyzing OER, but also in demonstrating good activity for ORR during the charging and discharging process.44
For a more quantitative analysis of LaNi1−xFexO3 in terms of its OER/ORR, the variation of the potential difference as a function of current flowing through the cell (polarization curve) allows for the driving of the overall rate of electrochemical reactions (kinetic parameters), and is evaluated on the basis of the Butler–Volmer equation:45 j = j0[exp(αanFη/RT) – exp(–αcnFη/RT)](6)where j is the total net current, j0 is the exchange current, αa and αc are the anodic and cathodic transfer coefficients, respectively, n is the number of electrons transferred during the overall reaction, F is the Faraday constant, R is the gas constant, T is the absolute temperature, and η is the overpotential defined as the potential difference between the applied potential and the equilibrium potential (EApplied − E0). However, the αa, αc and n terms, as expressed by the Butler–Volmer equation, can be simplified in terms of the multi-electron multi-step electrochemical reactions reported by Fletcher et al.46 These equations are derived as follows: αa = nr + nqβ(7) αc = np + nqβ(8) n = αa + αc(9)where nr is the number of electrons transferred after the RDS, nq is the number of electrons transferred during the RDS, np is the number of electrons transferred before the RDS, β is the symmetry factor, and the other symbols have their usual meaning. At high anodic or cathodic overpotential, the Butler–Volmer equation can be replaced by the Tafel equation that shows a linear relationship between η and log(ja or jc) as follows:47 log(ja) = log(j0) + η/ba(10) log(jc) = log(j0) + η/bc(11)where ja is the anodic current, jc is the cathodic current, j0 is the exchange current, η is the overpotential, ba is the anodic Tafel slope and bc is the cathodic Tafel slope. Using eqn (10) and (11), the Tafel slopes are experimentally obtained from the plots of η vs. log(j) as follows: ba = δη/δlog(ja) = (2.303RT/F)/αan(12) bc = δη/δlog(jc) = −(2.303RT/F)/αcn(13)
To deepen the assessment of the kinetic information, such as the overpotential, exchange current density and Tafel slope of the LaNi1−xFexO3 catalysts, the experimental Tafel plots derived from the corresponding OER and ORR polarization curves are presented in Fig. 4. The OER Tafel slopes of LaNiO3, LaNi0.9Fe0.1O3, LaNi0.7Fe0.3O3, LaNi0.5Fe0.5O3, LaNi0.3Fe0.7O3 and LaNi0.1Fe0.9O3 catalysts are calculated to be 85.0, 81.7, 68.2, 58.2, 62.0, and 79.5 mV dec−1, respectively, as shown in the upper side of Fig. 4(a). The Tafel slope of Ir2O and RuO2 were around 140 mV dec−1. This suggests that the first electrochemical oxidation is the RSD for Ir2O and RuO2. Although the different slopes of the Tafel curves correspond to the difference, a relatively small Tafel slope predicts more favorable OER/ORR kinetics, which makes it compatible for practical application. Therefore, the above result indicates that LaNi0.5Fe0.5O3 has better OER activity compared to Fe-free and other Fe-containing samples since the Tafel slope is the lowest (58.2 mV dec−1). Similarly, the ORR Tafel slopes of LaNiO3, LaNi0.9Fe0.1O3, LaNi0.7Fe0.3O3, LaNi0.5Fe0.5O3, LaNi0.3Fe0.7O3 and LaNi0.1Fe0.9O3 are found to be 66.2, −63.2, −64.3, −65.0, 74.5 and −64.8 mV dec−1, respectively, as shown in the lower side of Fig. 4(a). The above results indicate that the LaNi0.5Fe0.5O3 perovskite catalyst delivers better OER and ORR performance, smaller Tafel slope (OER = 58.2 mV dec−1, ORR = −65.0 mV dec−1) and lower overpotential compared to other catalysts, as shown in Fig. 4(b). The electrochemical performance of LaNi0.5Fe0.5O3 is attributed to its optimized structural and crystal structure. Furthermore, experimental Tafel slopes were used to evaluate the αa and αc, as follows: αa = (2.303RT/F)[δlog(ja)/δη](14) αc = (2.303RT/F)[δlog(jc)/δη](15)

3.3 Reduction and oxidation properties
The reducibility of the LaNi1−xFexO3 (x = 0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9) catalysts was studied using TPR measurements. The prepared catalysts were reduced to a temperature of 800 °C at a ramping rate of 3 °C under H2/Ar flow. The overall weight changes of these catalysts were recorded during the reduction. This procedure not only allows for the observation of the reduction profile of the samples, but also quantification of the extent of the reduction. In this study, we examine the relationship between the OER/ORR catalytic activity and the reduction and oxidation (redox) property through determination of the reduction rate of the LaNi1−xFexO3 catalysts by TPR measurement at 380 °C (υred,380°C). The TPR profiles are shown to have two peaks of reduction: the first peak at ca. 380 °C is assigned to the reduction of the Ni3+ to Ni2+; second reduction at ca. 525 °C is due to the reduction of Ni2+ to Ni0,48 as shown in Fig. 5. In all samples, the reduction peak intensity and temperature vary with x, and it is evident that the reducibility of the LaNi1−xFexO3 catalysts depends strongly on x. As indicated in Fig. 5, the low temperature step is used to calculate the reduction rate of all samples, whereas the LaFe0.5Ni0.5O3 perovskite catalyst is considered as a representative example. The reduction steps are written according to the following equation: LaFe(III)0.5Ni(III)0.5O3 + 0.5H2 → LaFe(III)0.5Ni(II)0.5O3−1/2 + 0.5H2O(16)
 Fig. 5  TPR profiles of LaNi1−xFexO3 (x = 0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9) perovskite oxides. The oxide samples (100 ± 5 mg) were heated from RT to 800 °C at a ramping rate of 3 °C under a flow of 5 vol% H2/Ar (50 mL min−1). 
Afterwards, the logarithmic reduction rate at 380 °C (log(υred,380°C)) is calculated using the mass difference with a time interval of 60 s at 380 °C, and subsequent conversion to 25 °C (log(υred,25°C)). The conversion is performed through differentiation of the potential with respect to the log(υred,380°C) and log(υred,25°C) according to the following expressions: dE/dInυ380 = RT380(dE/dEa) = (RT380/F) × (dE/dEa)(17) dE/dInυ25 = RT25(dE/dEa) = (RT25/F) × (dE/dEa)(18) (dE/dInυ380) × (F/RT380) = (dE/dInυ25) × (F/RT25)(19) d(Inυ25) = d[(T380/T25) × (Inυ380)](20)The final reduction rate of the LaNi1−xFexO3 perovskite oxides was calculated according to the above equations. The parameters used for the calculations are summarized in Table 3 below. Herein, M denotes the molar mass of the oxide, Δt the time interval, t the temperature, moxide the initial mass of the oxide, Δmoxide the mass of the reduced oxide, Δnoxygen the mole amount of oxygen eliminated by the reduction reaction, υred the rate of the reduction reaction, and E the potential for the OER/ORR reactions at 1 mA cm−2 and −1 mA cm−2, respectively.

3.4 Relationship between the reduction rate and OER/ORR catalytic activity
In order to reveal the correlation between the OER/ORR electrocatalytic activity and reduction rate obtained from electrochemical and TRP measurements using LaNi1−xFexO3 (x = 0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9) catalysts, we have studied the effects of the reduction rate at 25 °C (log(υred,25°C)) on the potential values (EOER/EORR at 1 mA cmdisk−2/−2 mA cmdisk−2). Interestingly, a volcano-type correlation between EOER/ORR in alkaline media and the reduction rate log(υred,25°C) is observed for the LaNi1−xFexO3 oxide catalysts, as shown in Fig. 6. As can be seen from the figure, the OER and ORR catalytic activities are approximately proportional to the reduction rates of the rapidly oxidized catalysts (LaNi1−xFexO3; x = 0.5, 0.7, 0.9) on the left-side of the volcano-type plot. Moreover, the catalytic activities for both OER and ORR are approximately proportional to the oxidation rates of the rapidly reduced catalysts (LaNi1−xFexO3; x = 0, 0.1, 0.3) on the right-side of the volcano-type plot. Hence, these unique relationships of log(υred,25°C) proportional to E(V)OER and log(υred,25°C) proportional to E(V)ORR on both sides of the volcano-type plot, suggest that the catalytic activity of the oxides depended on their rate of reduction and oxidation. In addition, the LaNi0.5Fe0.5O3 catalyst appears high on the volcano-type plot with high OER/ORR activities. These high electrochemical performances of LaNi0.5Fe0.5O3 are ascribed to its optimized structural features.
 Fig. 6  Volcano-type correlation between the electrocatalytic activities (EApplied, at 2 mA cmdisk−2 for OER and at −2 mA cmdisk−2 for ORR, respectively) and reduction rates [log(υred, μmol[O] s−1 goxide−1), at 25 °C] of LaNi1−xFexO3 catalysts. 
Furthermore, the EOER/EORRversus log(υred,25°C) of the volcano-type plots have slopes of −57 mV dec−1 for the OER, and 63 mV dec−1 for the ORR, which are consistent with the Tafel slopes. Tafel analyses supported by the TPR experimental results suggest that chemical activation of OH (charge transfer) is a rate-determining step (RDS) in the proposed OER/ORR redox cycles. Therefore, the above results suggest that the OER and ORR activities of the LaNi1−xFexO3 perovskite-oxides depend strongly on their redox property, which is one of the key factors influencing the electrocatalytic activity. Moreover, several studies reported that the LaNiO3 catalyst shows a high catalytic activity towards ORR, whereas the Fe-doped perovskite catalysts show a high catalytic activity towards OER. Besides, Nin+ and Fen+ cations have variable oxidation states, including +2, +3 and +4, that make them easily reducible and oxidizable species. As a result, the easily oxidizable and easily reducible properties of Nin+ and Fen+ cations enable us to study a correlation between the redox property and electrocatalytic property of this type of perovskite-oxides (LaNi1−xFexO3).
3.5 OER and ORR mechanisms involving a redox cycle of perovskite oxides
Several experimental studies have observed the dissociative adsorption of O2 on catalyst surfaces using a variety of techniques, such as scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM),49 electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS)50 and temperature-programmed X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (TP-XPS).51 Here, we propose OER and ORR mechanisms with the dissociation and association of oxygen accompanied by the redox cycles of the perovskite-oxide catalysts for the rapidly oxidized LaNi1−xFexO3 (x = 0.5, 0.7, 0.9; on the left-hand side of the volcano-type plots) and the rapidly reduced LaNi1−xFexO3 (x = 0, 0.1, 0.3; on the right-hand side of the volcano-type plots) catalysts in alkaline media. The OER and ORR mechanisms for the rapidly oxidized and rapidly reduced catalysts are illustrated in Fig. 7(a), (c) and (b), (d), respectively. Each mechanism is composed of a sequence of four elementary steps, such as ECEC for OER, and CECE for ORR, as shown in Tables 4 and 5. Here, E and C are denoted by electrochemical and chemical reactions, respectively. The electrochemical reactions are the discharge of OH− (step 1) and deprotonation of OH or OHads (step 3) for the OER, and the protonation of Oads (step 6) and charge of OH or OHads (step 8) for the ORR. On the other hand, the chemical reactions are the activation of OH or OHads (step 2) and desorption of Oads (step 4) for OER, and the adsorption of O (step 5), and charge transfer: activation of OH or OHads (step 7) for ORR. In order to determine the reaction kinetics of RDS for the OER and ORR redox cycles, experimentally obtained αa and αc were used. Eqn (7) and (8) provide nq = 0, suggesting that the RDS in the OER and ORR redox cycles is equal to a chemical reduction reaction or chemical oxidation reaction. This assumption is supported by the consistency of the results of the Tafel slopes and TPR slopes analyses. Consequently, the kinetics of charge transfer: chemical activation reactions of OH in step 2 and step 7 become the RDS for the OER/ORR redox cycles. It implies that the chemical reduction of the rapidly oxidized catalysts and the chemical oxidation of the rapidly reduced catalysts control the overall rate of the OER/ORR redox cycles, respectively. As a result, this study suggests that the chemical property of the oxide catalysts may play a key role in facilitating the rates of the OER/ORR reactions in alkaline metal–air batteries and fuel cells.
 Fig. 7  OER/ORR mechanisms proposed for redox cycles of the rapidly oxidized and reduced perovskite oxide catalysts. The OER (a and c) and ORR (b and d) of the LaNi1−xFexO3 catalysts in alkaline media proceed via 2 electron transfer steps. In the OER case (a and c): step 1, discharge of OH−; step 2, charge transfers: activation of OH (RDS for the left-side catalysts) and activation of OHads (RDS for the right-side catalysts); step 3, deprotonation of OH and OHads; step 4, desorption of Oads. In the ORR case (b and d): step 5, adsorption of O; step 6, protonation of Oads; step 7, charge transfer: activation of OH (RDS for the left-side catalysts) and charge transfer: activation of OHads (RDS for the right-side catalysts); step 8, charge of OH and OHads.

3.5.1. Reaction mechanisms on the rapidly oxidized catalysts. 
According to the analysis in section 3.5 and the proposed OER/ORR mechanisms for the redox cycles of the rapidly oxidized and rapidly reduced oxide catalysts (Fig. 7), the details of the proposed reaction mechanisms are summarized in Table 4. In the table, the steps, description of reactions, kinetics of chemical activation reactions and reaction types are summarized and presented clearly.


3.5.2. Reaction mechanisms on the rapidly reduced catalysts. 
On the basis of the discussion in section 3.5 and Fig. 7 above, the proposed reaction mechanisms on the rapidly reduced catalysts for both OER and ORR cases are summarized in Table 5.
It should be noted that the volcano-type plots described above show a peak at a reduction rate of ca. −4.0 involving the highest OER and ORR activities for the LaNi0.5Fe0.5O3 catalyst. This is because their chemical reduction rates are as high as their chemical oxidation rates. It suggests that the chemical redox reactions occur at equal rates of perovskite-oxide catalysts, which play a key role in maximizing their bifunctionality for the OER and ORR reactions.

4. Conclusions
Rapid progress has been made in the field of rechargeable ZAB over the past several years. This type of battery plays an important role in the replacement of old lead–acid batteries and other polluting and inefficient batteries. ZAB offer benefits in terms of energy density, environmental friendliness and safe operation to store and produce clean electricity for both fixed and portable appliances. While this field has been expanded, numerous aspects of ZAB are not fully understood. The most critical issue in ZABs is the slow OER and the ORR kinetics on the air cathode, which limits their performance. As the air cathode of ZABs, perovskite oxides have been widely demonstrated because of their tunable structure, high specific surface area and simple synthesis. However, a stable and efficient perovskite-oxide catalyst for the air electrode is still a challenge for the rechargeable ZAB. In order to understand the OER/ORR mechanisms that occur on the air cathode of ZABs, the LaNi1−xFexO3 perovskite-oxide catalysts have been employed and analyzed in terms of electrochemical analyses. The Tafel and TPR analyses showed a volcano-like correlation between electrocatalytic activity toward OER/ORR of the LaNi1−xFexO3 catalysts and their reduction rate (logυred,25). In addition, the OER/ORR activities of rapidly oxidized catalysts (LaNi1−xFexO3, where x = 0.5, 0.7, 0.9) and rapidly reduced catalysts (LaNi1−xFexO3, where x = 0, 0.1, 0.3) are linearly related to their reduction rates and oxidation rates, respectively. Moreover, analyses suggest that charge transfer: chemical activation of OH− is an important step in determining the rate, which implies that the rapidly oxidized catalyst and rapidly reduced catalyst control the overall rate of the OER and ORR redox cycles, respectively. Furthermore, the LaNi0.5Fe0.5O3 catalyst appearing high on the volcano-shaped plot exhibits high OER/ORR activities. This result suggests that the chemical reduction and oxidation reactions with equally efficient perovskite-oxide catalysts can enhance their OER/ORR activities. Consequently, it can be concluded that these outcomes contribute to a better understanding of the basic mechanisms of OER/ORR, and guide the development of this field.

 	Fig. 7  OER/ORR mechanisms proposed for redox cycles of the rapidly oxidized and reduced perovskite oxide catalysts. The OER (a and c) and ORR (b and d) of the LaNi1−xFexO3 catalysts in alkaline media proceed via 2 electron transfer steps. In the OER case (a and c): step 1, discharge of OH−; step 2, charge transfers: activation of OH (RDS for the left-side catalysts) and activation of OHads (RDS for the right-side catalysts); step 3, deprotonation of OH and OHads; step 4, desorption of Oads. In the ORR case (b and d): step 5, adsorption of O; step 6, protonation of Oads; step 7, charge transfer: activation of OH (RDS for the left-side catalysts) and charge transfer: activation of OHads (RDS for the right-side catalysts); step 8, charge of OH and OHads.
