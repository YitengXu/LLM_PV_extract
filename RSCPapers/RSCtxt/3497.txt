    , Accepted 3rd November 2021First published on 4th November 2021Abstract2D/3D heterojunction engineering has been regarded as a feasible method to improve the photovoltaic performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). A spacer molecule poses a huge influence on the structural and optoelectronic properties of 2D perovskites. A specific functional group embedded spacer molecule is highly expected to build an effective 2D capping layer for efficient, stable, and hysteresis-free PSCs. Here, a tailored spacer molecule, 4-hydroxy-phenylethylamine iodide (OH-PEAI), is developed for high-performance 2D/3D PSCs. A combined theoretical and experimental study suggests that OH-PEAI based 2D structure on the 3D surface significantly reduces defect density and mitigates nonradiative recombination. The target PSCs deliver an efficiency of 21.38% compared to 19.54% for the control device. A high open-circuit voltage (Voc) up to 1.234 V can be achieved with a Voc loss of only 0.376 V and the hysteresis can be totally eliminated. 2D/3D PSCs using a low-bandgap 3D perovskite can yield a high efficiency of 23.28%. The 2D layer also provides a robust interface that protects vulnerable 3D perovskite films from moisture attacks. As a result, the unencapsulated 2D/3D PSCs show excellent long-term stability retaining 93% of initial PCE in ambient air at 30% relative humidity for 480 h.
Introduction
Organic–inorganic hybrid lead perovskite has been regarded as one of the most promising semiconducting materials for photovoltaic devices due to the long diffusion length, large absorption coefficient, low exciton binding energy, and adjustable bandgap.1–6 These excellent photoelectric properties contribute to the fast development of power conversion efficiency (PCE) and a record PCE reaching 25.5% has been achieved for state-of-the-art perovskite solar cells (PSCs).7–15 According to the Shockley–Queisser (S–Q) model, the short-current density (Jsc) almost approaches its theoretical limit and the fill factor (FF) has reached a high level of over 80%.10,16,17 Enhancing the open-circuit voltage (Voc) is one of the most sensible choices to obtain high-performance PSCs.10,18 On the one hand, the energy band mismatch between the perovskite layer and charge transport layer can lead to charge recombination and Voc loss. On the other hand, trap-mediated charge recombination losses also cause the Voc to deviate from the radiative limit. To date, different methods such as band alignment optimization, crystal growth control, and defect passivation have been developed to reduce the Voc loss.7,10,19,20 Among them, defect passivation becomes one of the most efficient approaches owing to the close connection between Voc and nonradiative recombination.21,22 Fullerene derivatives, Lewis bases with donating electron pairs, and zwitterion molecules can act as efficient passivation agents for PSCs.7,18,23,24

In situ growth of 2D perovskites to form 2D/3D heterojunction PSCs has been considered as a feasible method to suppress unfavorable nonradiative recombination for high PCE with long-term stability and lower Voc loss. 2D perovskites, which owns a wider bandgap than 3D perovskites, provide a defect-less interface and modified energy band that can minimize charge recombination at the interface area.25–30 To date, various spacer molecules have been chosen to form 2D perovskites and applied as a surface passivation layer for PSCs. Chen et al. reported that introducing phenethylammonium iodide (PEAI) on a 3D perovskite to fabricate 2D/3D PSCs could enhance the PCE from 17.02% to 18.51% and the device retained nearly 90% of the original PCE after aging 1000 h.31 Wang et al. investigated PEAI-like molecules with different functional groups attached to the benzene ring as spacer molecules for 2D perovskite. They found that higher electron cloud density on the benzene ring offers a better passivation effect and 2D/3D PSCs exhibited higher photovoltaic performance and long-term stability.32 In spite of achieved progress, it is still a challenge to approach the S–Q limit in Voc and eliminate the hysteresis behavior. A robust interface between 2D and 3D perovskite with strengthened chemical bonding is of great importance to the stability and charge transport of 2D/3D heterojunction. The structural and electronic characters of spacer molecules pose a huge influence on the optoelectronic properties of the resulting 2D perovskite. The emergence of new kinds of spacer molecules with specific functional groups is highly anticipated to build a high-quality 2D/3D heterojunction and further reduce the Voc loss for efficient, stable, and hysteresis-free PSCs.
Here, we, for the first time, develop and use 4-hydroxy-phenylethylamine iodide (OH-PEAI) as a spacer molecule for 2D perovskite and investigate its application in 2D/3D heterojunction PSCs. Compared with PEAI, OH-PEAI has an additional hydroxyl group at the para-benzene site. The introduction of OH-PEAI on top of 3D perovskite can readily form a 2D structure with the excess PbI2 at room temperature without needing the post-heat treatment. The existence of a 2D perovskite capping layer drastically decreases the number of defects, and non-radiative recombination can be greatly suppressed. As a result, the target 2D/3D PSCs can deliver an impressive PCE of 21.38% and a Voc of 1.234 V with hysteresis-free behavior. 2D/3D PSCs using low-bandgap 3D perovskite can lead to the high efficiency of 23.28%. Meanwhile, the unencapsulated 2D/3D PSCs show excellent long-term stability, which is superior to the 3D devices.
Results and discussion
The configuration of PSCs in this study involves an indium tin oxide (ITO)/compact SnO2/3D or 2D/3D perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD/Ag. 3D perovskite film with a composition of Rb0.05Cs0.05[(FA0.83MA0.17)]0.9Pb(I0.83Br0.17)3 that is widely used in high-performance PSCs33 was chosen to demonstrate the effect of 2D/3D mixed-dimensional engineering. FA and MA represent formamidine and methylamine ions, respectively. Unless otherwise stated, the 3D perovskite film in the following discussion is denoted as the above-mentioned one. A compact and pinhole-free 3D perovskite film with a thickness of around 350 nm was obtained as shown in the cross-section scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images (Fig. S1†). The chemical structure of OH-PEAI is shown in Fig. 1a. A schematic drawing that shows the architecture of 2D/3D PSCs is presented in Fig. 1b. In order to identify the structure of the formed capping layer with different concentrations of OH-PEAI, we performed X-ray diffraction (XRD) and the results are shown in Fig. 1c. The 3D perovskite film exhibits characteristic diffraction peaks of perovskite and the diffraction peak at 12.7° is assigned to PbI2. The excess PbI2 can react with OH-PEAI and transform into 2D perovskite. As the concentration of OH-PEAI increases, the signal of PbI2 gradually weakens and a new diffraction peak at 6.18° from 2D perovskite appears. Fig. 1d shows the UV-vis absorption spectra and the corresponding Tauc plot of 3D perovskite films. The spectra show that the 3D perovskite has a bandgap of 1.61 eV and the introduction of the 2D phase does not apparently affect the light absorption. To obtain morphological information, top-view scanning electron microscope (SEM) and atomic force microscope (AFM) images of the 2D/3D (4 mg mL−1 OH-PEAI) and 3D perovskite films were captured. SEM images in Fig. 2a and d show that the OH-PEAI-treated perovskite films become blurred at the grain boundaries, but the surface is still smooth. The surface roughness decreases from 14.1 nm for 3D perovskite film to 13.4 nm for the 2D/3D perovskite film as manifested in the corresponding AFM images (Fig. 2b and e). To identify the distribution of the 2D phase on the 3D perovskite film surface, the photoluminescence (PL) mappings of perovskite films (Fig. 2c and f) were performed using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). Apparently, the PL signals from the 2D phase can be detected on the 3D perovskite surface, showing the successful construction of a 2D/3D heterojunction. It is noted that the PL intensity of the 2D phase is not evenly distributed, which is ascribed to the position-dependant 2D phase content on the 3D surface and the limited resolution of the microscopy.34,35

To gain more information about the structural properties, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) on 2D/3D and 3D perovskite films were measured as shown in Fig. 3a and b. Both, Pb 4f and I 3d peaks of 2D/3D perovskite films exhibit a slight shift in binding energy compared to the 3D film, which accounts for the changed chemical bonding of the Pb and I after the incorporation of OH-PEAI based 2D perovskite. Notably, there are two small peaks of Pb0 located at 141.3 eV and 136.5 eV in the 3D perovskite film.36 The intensity of the Pb0 peak reduces obviously after OH-PEAI treatment, which indicates that Pb0 defects have been passivated. It has been reported that Pb0 defects in the perovskite film can serve as the charge recombination centers, and the reduction of Pb0 defect density will have a positive impact on the charge dynamics.37 For the C 1s signal (Fig. S2a†), the CO peak at 288.0 eV is attributed to the degradation of perovskite by adsorbed oxygen or moisture at the surface. This peak intensity is substantially weakened for the 2D/3D perovskite film in comparison to the 3D perovskite film. The formation of a 2D perovskite capping layer could efficiently block the invasion of the active components such as oxygen and moisture in ambient air and thus suppress the degradation of vulnerable 3D perovskite films.38–41 For the N 1s spectrum (Fig. S2b†), the featured peak at 400.1 eV assigned to the FA+ cation can be observed in both films. After passivation, there is an extra peak at a binding energy of 401.7 eV, which is characteristic of the amine group from OH-PEAI.31 The weaker intensity of the FA+ cation in the 2D passivated perovskite film than that in the pristine film is due to the 2D capping layer-induced shielding effect. The XPS survey scan in a wide binding energy range is provided in Fig. S3.†

The insets are surface potential distribution along the yellow dotted line marked in the corresponding 2D mapping images. The concentration of OH-PEAI for post-treatment is 4 mg mL−1. 
The charge recombination kinetics in 2D/3D and 3D perovskite films were characterized with steady-state PL and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra. As shown in Fig. 3c, 3D perovskites display a strong emission peak at 770 nm. The intensity of this peak obviously increase with the increased concentration of OH-PEAI, which represents reduced nonradiative recombination. Meanwhile, compared with 3D perovskite, 2D/3D perovskite shows extra PL peaks at 520 nm, 569 nm, and 623 nm, owing to the PL emission of 2D perovskite with n = 1, n = 2, and n = 3, respectively. The appearance of 2D perovskite PL peaks provides a strong evidence for the formation of a 2D perovskite capping layer. It is worth noting that high n-value (n ≥ 3) 2D phases have a higher conductivity than low n-value ones, and the growth of high n-value 2D phase may offer an effective charge transport pathway from the 2D/3D heterojunction to the hole transport layer. The TRPL spectra of corresponding perovskite films are shown in Fig. 3d and the detailed fitting results are listed in Table S2.† The average carrier lifetime of the 2D/3D perovskite film (4 mg mL−1 OH-PEAI) is 185.90 ns, which is much longer than that of the 3D perovskite film (58.39 ns). Both, the stronger PL intensity and longer carrier lifetime in 2D/3D perovskite support the conclusion that 2D perovskite with OH-PEAI as a spacer molecule can substantially reduce the amount of trap density and suppress the nonradiative recombination. The energy band alignment of the perovskite films was investigated by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS). From the UPS spectra in Fig. S4,† the work function of 3D and 2D/3D perovskite were determined to be −4.91 and −4.46 eV with the valence band maximum (Ev) of −5.62 and −5.34 eV, respectively. The well-matched energy band alignment after the introduction of 2D perovskite on top of 3D perovskite favors the charge extraction by the hole transport layer.42 Furthermore, Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) was measured to probe the surface electronic state (Fig. 3e and f). After introducing the 2D layer, the surface potential elevates and the Fermi-level shifts toward the vacuum energy correspondingly. This result is consistent with the fitted work function from the UPS measurement. Due to this energy-level alignment, the electrons moving toward the perovskite surface will be bounced back and effectively eliminate surface recombination, which can further contribute to the enhancement of Voc.43,44
To investigate the effect of the 2D/3D heterojunction on the performance of PSCs, J–V curves of PSCs with different concentrations of OH-PEAI were measured as shown in Fig. 4a. The corresponding photovoltaic parameters including Voc, Jsc, FF, and PCE are presented in Table 1. The champion PCE for the 3D PSCs is 19.54% with a Voc of 1.13 V, Jsc of 23.27 mA cm−2 and FF of 74.22%. The best 2D/3D device is achieved with 4 mg mL−1 OH-PEAI and it delivers a PCE of 21.38% with a Voc of 1.22 V, Jsc of 23.25 mA cm−2 and FF of 75.50%. It is noted that a high Voc of 1.234 V and a Voc loss of only 0.376 V can be realized with the existence of a 2D perovskite capping layer (Fig. S5†), which is among the best-reported values. The distribution of photovoltaic parameters is presented in Fig. S6.† A higher concentration of OH-PEAI (6 mg mL−1), however, leads to decreased performance, mainly due to the reduction of Jsc and FF. The increased concentration of OH-PEAI results in a thicker 2D capping, which can retard the charge transport. The J–V curves of 3D and 2D/3D devices under different scan directions are shown in Fig. 4b and the results are summarized in Table S3.† The degree of hysteresis could be reflected by the hysteresis index H defined by (PCEreverse − PCEforward)/PCEreverse.45 The 2D/3D PSCs suffer from a much lower hysteresis (0.09%) than the 3D devices (12.4%). The lower hysteresis can be attributed to the reduced defect density at the interfaces by the optimized 2D capping layer. Steady-state outputs at maximum power point (MPP) for the two types of PSCs were measured as shown in Fig. 4c. The 2D/3D device can maintain a steady-state PCE of 20.20%, which is higher than the pristine 3D PSC (18.39%). Meanwhile, we compared the Voc and PCE from our experiments with those previously reported 2D/3D PSCs with a regular architecture and perovskite bandgap (1.58–1.63 eV). The detailed photovoltaic parameters are provided in Table S1.† By introducing OH-PEAI-based 2D perovskite on the 3D perovskite surface, an impressive PCE and Voc have been achieved and the device performance is comparable to highly efficient planar-type PSCs.

We further compared the charge dynamic properties of PSCs with and without 2D perovskite capping layer. Vocversus light intensity (I) was performed as shown in Fig. 4d. The ideality factor (n) can be calculated according to the formula Voc = nKBTln(I)/q, where KB is the Boltzmann constant, T is the absolute temperature, and q is the elementary charge. The 2D/3D PSCs have an n value of 1.11, which is lower than that (1.48) of the 3D PSCs. The lowered n value indicates a decreased trap-assisted recombination. Meanwhile, the space charge limited current (SCLC) of electron-only devices with a structure of ITO/SnO2/(2D/3D or 3D perovskite)/PCBM/Ag was measured to calculate the trap densities (Fig. 4e). The trap densities Nt of the devices can be determined according to the following formula: Nt = 2εVTFL/qL2, where ε is the dielectric constant, VTFL is the trap-filling limited voltage, q is the elemental charge, and L is the thickness of the films. The density of trap states is significantly reduced after introducing 2D perovskite, with the VTFL decreasing from 0.36 V to 0.25 V and Nt from 1.55 × 1016 cm−3 to 1.05 × 1016 cm−3. The lowered trap density in 2D/3D perovskite is partly responsible for the reduced charge recombination and Voc loss. Moreover, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was measured to study the charge transport and recombination.46,47 The Nyquist plots of 2D/3D and control devices are shown in Fig. 4f. There are two different semicircles at different frequency ranges. Generally, Rct and Rrec represent the charge transport resistance and the charging interface recombination resistance, respectively.48,49 The fitted Rct and Rrec values of 3D and 2D/3D devices are presented in Table S4.† Compared with the 3D device, the Rct of 2D/3D device is a little smaller, while the Rrec value is much larger. These results verify that the 2D/3D heterojunction PSCs could facilitate carrier transport and mitigate charge recombination.
To test if the OH-PEAI based 2D perovskite can be applied to 3D perovskite with a lower bandgap, we fabricated PSCs based on Cs0.05FA0.85MA0.10Pb(I0.97Br0.03)3, a perovskite light-absorber with a bandgap of 1.56 eV. Details of thin-film deposition can be found in the experimental section. The corresponding J–V curves of 3D and 2D/3D PSCs are shown in Fig. S7.† As expected, the introduction of OH-PEAI-based 2D perovskite on low-bandgap 3D perovskite can also improve the photovoltaic performance of PSCs compared with 3D control solar cell and a high PCE of 23.28% can be fulfilled for the 2D/3D device.
Thus far, we have successfully demonstrated the positive role of OH-PEAI-based 2D perovskite in boosting the photovoltaic performance of PSCs. In our opinion, the excellent optoelectronic properties of 2D/3D heterojunction in this study arise from the unique molecule structure of the spacer molecule for 2D perovskite. First, the 2D perovskite can be formed once there is the introduction of OH-PEAI on the surface of 3D perovskite without heat treatment as discussed above, suggesting low formation energy of 2D perovskite when using OH-PEAI as the spacer molecule. It is reported that when PEAI is used as a spacer molecule, the 2D phase on the 3D perovskite surface can be obtained only via thermal annealing.31 The difference between PEAI and OH-PEAI is the hydroxyl group at the para-benzene site, which is responsible for the different formation energy. Second, the hydroxyl group on the benzene ring can not only interact with Pb2+ but also form hydrogen bonding with I− in the 3D perovskite. The former can passivate the uncoordinated Pb2+ ion and the latter will strengthen the interaction of 3D and 2D perovskites with a robust interface, both of which favor the formation of high-quality 2D/3D heterojunction.11,50,51 In fact, we observed a less satisfactory performance of PSCs when choosing PEAI as surface passivator (Fig. S8†), because of a lack of chemical bonding interactions.
To better illustrate the mechanism of defect passivation by OH-PEAI, we performed a first-principles calculation based on density functional theory. The models for the calculation include the perfect surface, surface with iodine vacancy (VI) or FA+ vacancy (VFA), and passivated VI or VFA with OH-PEAI (Fig. S9 and S10†). The electron localization function (ELF) in Fig. 5a shows that electron localization around Pb atoms is reduced when VI is present, which may cause nonradiative recombination.52 After the adsorption of OH-PEAI on the Pb ions, the dangling states of the uncoordinated Pb can be passivated and ELF becomes almost the same as with the defect-free surface. Fig. 5b displays the differential charge density distribution when the hydroxyl group of the OH-PEAI molecule fills into VI on the FAPbI3 surface. It can be found that OH-PEAI donates electrons to the uncoordinated Pb ions, which is in agreement with the decreased Pb0 signals in the XPS result as discussed above. According to the local density of states (LDOS) of the Pb atom in Fig. 5c, a localized defect state near the Fermi level that is detrimental to charge transport appears when the VI exists. The defect state density is remarkably reduced in the presence of OH-PEAI. The results clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of OH-PEAI in passivating the VI vacancy defects. For the VFA defects, ELF results are shown in Fig. S11a.† When the OH-PEAI molecule fills into the VFA on the FAPbI3 surface, the phenethylamine group could passivate VFA so that the profile of ELF around VFA is similar to the defect-free surface. The defect passivation can be also supported by the differential charge density plot, as shown in Fig. S11b.† The total DOS partially recovers to the perfect defect-free FAPbI3 after introducing OH-PEAI above VFA (Fig. S11c†). Hence, the first-principles calculation confirms that the OH-PEAI spacer molecule could passivate both the VI and VFA defects with the hydroxyl and phenethylamine groups, respectively, to reconstruct the electronic structure.

(b) Differential charge density when OH-PEAI fills into VI. The green and yellow isosurfaces represent the accumulation and loss of electron density, respectively. (c) The LDOS of relative Pb in each case. 
Except for efficiency, device stability is also a crucial aspect to evaluate the performance of PSCs. Among the external conditions for the degradation of perovskite films, moisture is one of the most vital factors. To investigate the resistance of the perovskite film toward moisture, the water contact angle was measured as shown in Fig. 6a. The water contact angle of 2D/3D perovskite film has a very small decrease from 61.7° to 50.5° after loading the water drop for ten minutes. In sharp contrast, the contact angle for the 3D film decreases from 60.0° to 36.9° after the same period. This result indicates that the 2D capping layer can effectively prevent water molecules from entering the internal perovskite, leading to enhanced moisture stability. In addition, the XRD patterns of perovskite films stored in ambient air (30% RH) were measured (Fig. 6b). After aging for 70 days, the XRD patterns of the 3D perovskite film showed stronger signals of PbI2 than those in the fresh sample, which means an obvious decomposition. However, the PbI2 peak intensity of the 2D/3D perovskite film changed slightly after the same aging time, proving a better moisture resistance. It is worth noting that the characteristic XRD peak of 2D perovskite disappears after aging. A similar phenomenon had been found in previous reports42,53 and it is considered that the 2D perovskite will gradually convert to higher-dimensional layered perovskite, and eventually transform into 3D perovskite during long-term aging. This change in structure needs further investigation and it is beyond the scope of the current study. Finally, the long-term stability of unencapsulated PSCs was traced under ambient conditions with 30% RH as presented in Fig. 6c. After aging for 480 h, the 2D/3D PSCs maintain 93% of the initial PCE. However, only 64% of the initial PCE can be preserved for 3D PSCs during the same aging time. Meanwhile, we also tested the long-term stability of PSCs with the lower bandgap without or with 2D surface passivation (Fig. S12†), and as expected better stability can be achieved for the 2D/3D device. The improvement in the long-term stability for 2D/3D PSC benefits from the low defect density and the robust interface with the existence of a 2D perovskite capping layer.

Conclusions
In summary, we have developed a new type of spacer molecule, OH-PEAI, for 2D perovskite, and the 2D/3D heterojunction can be easily formed by the post-treatment at room temperature accompanied with reduced defect density and suppressed nonradiative charge recombination. The champion device based on 2D/3D heterojunction can achieve a high Voc approaching 1.24 V and an impressive PCE of 21.38%. Moreover, 2D/3D PSCs show significantly improved long-term stability with 93% of the initial PCE maintained after 480 h of storage in ambient air, which is much better than that of 3D PSCs without a 2D capping layer. Our work demonstrates the significance of spacer molecules in the formation of high-quality 2D perovskite and the benefit of constructing 2D/3D heterojunction in reducing the Voc losses and hysteresis while improving stability for high-performance PSCs.
