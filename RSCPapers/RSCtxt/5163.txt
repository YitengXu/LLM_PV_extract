    , Accepted 12th July 2011First published on 22nd July 2011AbstractTwo newly synthesized naphthodithiophene-based copolymers, PNB, exhibit a low optical bandgap of ∼1.64 eV with which the solar cells fabricated from the blend of PNB and PC71BM afforded a power conversion efficiency of 5.3% with external quantum efficiency over 60% in a broad spectral range.
Organic/polymeric photovoltaic (PV) cells have received considerable attention from both academia and industry due to the demand for inexpensive and renewable energy sources.1 Some examples of organic PV applications have recently been demonstrated.2 The fast growing development of bulk heterojunction (BHJ) PV cells based on solution-processable p-type-conjugated polymers and n-type fullerene derivatives has recently made tremendous progress with power conversion efficiencies (PCE) reaching greater than 7%.3 Such great advancement is mainly due to the development of new low bandgap p-type materials with strong and broad absorption, the effective fabrication processes such as solvent annealing, thermal annealing and the use of solvent additives for proper control of the interpenetrating network morphology of a donor and acceptor blend as well as the optimized device structure.4
The use of the intramolecular charge transfer from an electron-rich unit to an electron-deficient unit has become a promising approach to obtain low bandgap polymers. Over the years, various strongly absorbing donor–acceptor type copolymers with the optical bandgap in the range of 1.4–1.9 eV have been developed to improve the light-harvesting efficiency from the solar radiation. Besides the optical bandgap, the choice of the electron-rich moiety provides a means of proper control of the position of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level of a donor material, which is indispensable to achieving high open-circuit voltage (Voc) of a BHJ solar cell and also directly related to the hole transport property and photostability of the resulting polymers. On the other hand, the choice of the electron-deficient unit allows tuning of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level to facilitate effective exciton dissociation at the heterojunction. Various highly planar fused aromatic electron-rich units such as 2,7-carbazole,5dithienosilole,3c,6cyclopentadithiophene7 and benzodithiophene8 and electron-deficient units such as 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole,9thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione,10fluoro-substituted benzo[d][1,2,3]triazole,3d,11ketone- or ester-substituted thieno[3,4-b]thiophene3c,12 have been developed and found promising as building blocks of donor materials for high performance PV cells.

        Naphthodithiophene derivatives have been shown to promote highly ordered π-stacked structures resulting in a high hole carrier mobility for organic field-effect transistor applications13 and the 5,6-dialkylnaphthodithiophene-based donor–acceptor polymer has demonstrated improved performance in the solar cell devices.14 However, the dialkyloxynaphthodithiophene unit has not been explored as an electron-rich unit for low bandgap polymers. In this work, we report herein new alternating low bandgap copolymers, PNB-3 and PNB-4 based on 5,6-bis(2′-ethyl-hexyloxy)naphthodithiophene and 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole or 4,7-bis(3'-decylthiophen-2-yl)-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole, respectively, with the optical bandgap of ∼1.64 eV. The solution-processed PV device based on the blends of PNB and PC71BM afforded a PCE up to 5.3% with over 60% external quantum efficiency (EQE) in a broad spectral range. This suggests that 5,6-dialkyloxy-naphthodithiophene is a promising building unit of a donor material for developing efficient PV cells.
Donor–acceptor type copolymers, PNB-3 and PNB-4, were synthesized by the Stille polycondensation reaction of 5,6-bis(2′-ethylhexyloxy)-2,9-bis(tri-n-butylstannyl)naphtho[2,1-b:3,4-b′] dithiophene with 4,7-dibromo-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole and 4,7-bis(5′-bromo-3′-decylthiophen-2-yl)-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole, respectively, using Pd(PPh3)4 as a catalyst in toluene/DMF at 120 °C for 42 h under N2 (Scheme 1). The newly synthesized polymers are readily soluble in various chlorinated solvents including chloroform and chlorobenzene. In contrast, when the linear decyloxy chains were substituted at the 5- and 6- positions of the naphthodithiophene unit, the resulting copolymers showed poor solubility in chlorinated solvents even at an elevated temperature. These copolymers have a number average molecular weight (Mn) of 14.8 kDa with a polydisperse index (PDI) of 1.79 and 33.4 kDa with a PDI of 1.62 for PNB-3 and PNB-4, respectively, as determined by gel permeation chromatography using THF as eluent. The two polymers showed high thermal stability with decomposition temperature in the range of 352–400 °C as determined by thermal gravimetric analysis but no distinct glass transition as revealed by differential scanning calorimetry.

The UV-vis absorption spectra of the polymers, PNB-3 and PNB-4, in THF and in thin films are shown in Fig. 1. Both spectra show two distinct absorption bands with the major absorption ranging from 450 to 750 nm, corresponding to an optical bandgap of ∼1.64 eV. PBN-4 shows a red shift in the absorption maximum when compared with that of PNB-3, which is due to the extended conjugation length contributed by the two additional thienyl rings. There is a slight red shift in the absorption spectra for both polymers in thin films relative to those in THF or CHCl3 due to the improved π-π stacking in solid state films.

Absorption spectra of PNB-3 and PNB-4 in THF and thin films. 

Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was used to determine the HOMO and LUMO levels of the copolymers. The HOMO levels of PNB-3 and PNB-4 are estimated to be −5.22 eV and −5.13 eV, respectively, based on the onset oxidation potentials using ferrocene as an external standard. These results are consistent with the fact that the monomeric unit of PBN-4 has a longer conjugation length. In a similar fashion, the LUMO levels are estimated to be −3.44 eV and −3.54 eV for PBN-3 and PBN-4, respectively. Thus, the obtained electrochemical gaps of PNB-3 and PNB-4 are 1.78 eV and 1.60 eV, respectively, which are in good agreement with the optical bandgap (Table 1).

The potential of these polymers in solution-processable photovoltaic cells was explored. The BHJ PV cells with a device structure of ITO/PEDOT (30 nm)/PNB:PC71BM (100 nm) (1:2)/BCP (5 nm)/LiF (1 nm)/Al, where bathocuproine (BCP) acts as an exciton-blocking layer, were fabricated by the spin-casting of a PEDOT–PSS layer and then a blend of the PNB:PC71BM layer in hot chlorobenzene followed by vacuum deposition of BCP, LiF and Al as the cathode. The PV responses of these devices were measured under AM 1.5 simulated solar illumination at an irradiation intensity of 100 mW cm−2. The devices were tested in air without encapsulation and the thickness of the active layer was optimized to the best overall device performance with an active area of 0.7 × 0.7 cm2. The results of the device performance are summarized in Table 2. Fig. 2 shows the current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of PNB-3 and PNB-4 based devices. The optimized PNB-4 based device generally shows superior device performance with Voc = 0.72 V, fill factor (FF) = 0.56 and PCE = 1.73% to that of the PNB-3 based device (Voc = 0.68 V, FF = 0.32 and PCE = 0.61%) although the two polymers have very similar low optical bandgap. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves also show that the PNB-4 based device exhibits higher efficient photoconversion efficiency than that of PNB-3 based one in the spectral range between 300 to 750 nm (Fig. 3). It is well known that a solvent additive can have tremendous impact on the morphology of the blend film and hence affecting the device performance.15Fig. 2 shows the J–V characteristics of PNB-3 and PNB-4 based devices fabricated with a solvent additive, 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) (3% by volume). Indeed, the PNB-4 based device shows a dramatic enhancement in the photovoltaic performance in which the PCE reaches 5.3% with Voc = 0.64 V, short-circuit current (Jsc) = 13.5 mA cm−2 and FF = 0.62. Such a device exhibits a broad and strong photoresponse with EQE over 50% in the spectral range from 350 nm to 640 nm and a maximum of EQE (EQEmax) reaching 67% at 457 nm. The wavelength integration of the product of the EQE curve and the standard AM 1.5G solar spectrum affords a calibrated Jsc of 12.66 mA cm−2, which is 6% smaller than that measured from J–V measurement due to a spectral mismatch. In contrast, there is no apparent improvement in device performance for the PNB-3 based PV cell fabricated from chlorobenzene with the DIO additive.

To get insight into the origin of such dramatic enhancement in device performance for the PNB-4 based device fabricated from solvent additive processing, the morphologies of the blend films were investigated by atomic force microscopy (AFM). As shown in Fig. S3(a) and (b) in ESI†, discrete and large domains (∼500 nm in diameter) are formed in the blend film prepared from chlorobenzene without using DIO, which is detrimental to the efficient exciton dissociation and charge transport. The large domain hinders the extraction of the carrier and results in low photocurrent. As shown in Fig. S3(c) and (d) (ESI†), the addition of DIO dramatically modified the phase segregation of the blend film. It is mainly attributed to the improved miscibility of PNB-4 and PC71BM. The formation of nanoscale fine networks between donor and acceptor materials facilitates both the exciton dissociation and charge transport in the blend film. This is consistent with the large improvement of photocurrent from 4.3 mA cm−2 to 13.5 mA cm−2 in OPV devices. Such phenomenon is also observed in recently reported efficient OPV devices.3d,4c
In summary, we have successfully developed new alternating low bandgap copolymers, PNB, based on 5,6-bis(2′-ethylhexyloxy)naphthodithiophene and 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole or 4,7-bis(3′-decylthiophen-2-yl)-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole with the optical bandgap of ∼1.64 eV for organic solar cells. The bulk heterojunction solar cell fabricated from the blend of PNB-4 and PC71BM using diiodooctane as a solvent additive afforded a power conversion efficiency of 5.3% with an external quantum efficiency over 60% in a broad spectral range. As a result, PNB-4 shows promising potential for further development and device optimization for practical applications. Our results also suggest that 5,6-dialkyloxynaphthodithiophene is a useful electron-rich building unit of a donor material for efficient cells.
