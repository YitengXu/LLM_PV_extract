    , Accepted 2nd October 2015First published on 6th October 2015AbstractThe one-step synthesis of nanoscale conjugated microporous polymer (NCMP) capsules is presented by using PMAA microspheres as self-sacrificial templates. Precise control over the morphology, nanostructure and shell thickness makes the NCMPs have a tunable NIR absorption ability and a shape-dependent photothermal conversion efficiency. Upon exposure to 808 nm light, they rapidly generate heat (NCMP concentration: 100 μg mL−1) and cause thermal ablation of HeLa cells with less than 10% viability.
Conjugated microporous polymers (CMPs), which are composed of conjugated organic skeletons in a microporous network, have aroused a lot of attention for multiple applications.1 Since the advent of the first CMP,2 synthetic tricks for designing CMPs have been explored to modulate the compositions, topological structures and porosity for enhancing their functionalities. Compared with the early reported CMP solids synthesized without control, nanoscale CMPs (NCMPs) with solution-dispersible characteristics are more readily tailored for morphology, size and surface chemistry, and they have been developed into versatile forms including solid microspheres,3 hollow capsules4 and nanotubes.5 In our group, we investigated the confined growth of CMP networks in the miniemulsion system.3 Not only organic functional units (e.g. metalloporphyrin, tetraphenylene ethylene),6 but inorganic nanoparticles (e.g. Fe3O4, Pd) have also either been covalently bonded to organic skeletons or incorporated within porous frameworks.7 This route seems flexible and effective in expanding NCMP variety, but some issues are hard to circumvent, for example, poor solubility of the polar monomers and catalysts in apolar oil-phase droplets, inferior stability of the miniemulsion under harsh reaction conditions, and difficult removal of residual surfactants from the CMP particles. Without any additives, Son and co-workers adopted template-mediated (e.g. SO2, MOF and Fe3O4) precipitation polymerization to construct a core/shell microsphere and then they eliminated the template to give a hollow-inside NCMP with a freely standing CMP shell.4,8 Although with this method there is a need to pay more attention to the control of CMP formation, the obtained products could possess adjustable colloidal architectures and collective properties for broader applications. As we know, this template-mediated strategy has been widely applied to fabricate a variety of porous capsules with the shells consisting of carbon, silica or polymers.9
Near-infrared (NIR) photothermal therapy using nanoparticles has gained a lot of interest as a minimally invasive and efficient treatment for cancer.10 The commonly used photothermal agents are gold-based nanoparticles.11 Their potential shape-dependent toxicity in vivo has been questioned,12 even though they have shown excellent cytocompatibility. Recently, there has been a shift towards using carbon-based nanomaterials and conjugated polymers due to their potentially better biocompatibility and high photothermal conversion efficiency.13 To our knowledge, there are no reports concerning the potential of CMPs in bio-applications. We envision access to design NCMPs as photothermal agents due to their highly crosslinked conjugated networks, which lead to a decrease of the energy gap and a red-shift of the main absorption peak to a longer-wavelength region. Also, the high surface areas with opening pore channels allow for the rapid diffusion of generated heat from the conjugated skeletons to the surroundings.14 Herein, a one-step strategy is proposed to construct NCMP microcapsules with desired morphologies and functions. As illustrated in Scheme 1, three kinds of crosslinked poly(methacrylic acid) (PMAA) microspheres are applied as templates to anchor the metal-based catalysts with abundant carboxylate groups on the PMAA chains. 1,4-Dibromobenzene and 1,3,5-triethynylbenzene are polymerized by using the Pd(II)/Cu(I)-catalyzed Sonogashira coupling reaction to achieve a microporous poly(aryleneethynylene) shell. Accompanied by the progressive formation of the CMP shell, the amide bonds of N,N′-methylene bisacrylamide (MBA), the crosslinker of the PMAA particles, could be cleaved and the unlocked PMAA chains are dissolved to leave a hollow cavity and a freely standing CMP nanoshell in one step.
 Scheme 1  Illustration of the modulation of NCMP nanostructures by using the various PMAA microspheres as self-sacrificial templates. 
The TEM images in Fig. 1a–c display the template particles with different morphologies and structures. The low crosslinked PMAA microspheres are uniform both in size and morphology (Fig. 1a); as the crosslinking density increases from 20% to 50%, the particle surface becomes rough and the overall morphology is flower-like with a slight increase in size (Fig. 1b). By virtue of the reflux precipitation polymerization, PMAA could well encapsulate the Fe3O4 nanoclusters to give a defined core/shell nanostructure (Fig. 1c). The three template particles were then applied to modulate the NCMP nanostructures. As shown in Fig. 1d, when the monodispersed PMAA microspheres were used as the template, the corresponding products appear as a hollow cavity with a regular shell with a uniform thickness of 40 nm. Also, the flower-like NCMP (F-NCMP) and the magnetic NCMP (Fe3O4@H-NCMP) were obtained (Fig. 1e and f), respectively, once the designed PMAA templates were applied. As a control, the bulk CMPs synthesized without using the PMAA templates exhibit a nanotube morphology (Fig. S1a in ESI†), indicating that the formation of the NCMP capsules is mediated by the self-sacrificial PMAA microspheres. By varying the reaction conditions including the solvent species, reaction temperature and PMAA crosslinkers, we found that if triethylamine is used as a co-catalyst and solvent, the amide bonds of the crosslinker MBA would be broken, and the PMAA chains would be unlocked and spread out across the shell. The TGA results imply that there are no PMAA chains remaining within the formed microcapsules (Fig. S2 in ESI†). To further prove the assumption, divinylbenzene (DVB) was used to crosslink the PMAA particles, and they were subjected to the same template-mediated polymerization. As observed, the hollow cavity didn't form, revealing that there is no PMAA template decomposing in the reaction (Fig. S3 in ESI†). Additionally, we found that the elevated temperature is helpful to eliminate the PMAA template for a completely hollow inside (Fig. S4 in ESI†).

To tune the shell thickness, we varied the feeding amount of the PMAA particles from 240 to 80 mg under otherwise identical conditions. As displayed in Fig. 2, the thickness of the CMP shell increases from 30, 50, 100 to 140 nm. Interestingly, the overall size of the samples remains invariant around 500 nm. With an increase in shell thickness, the diameter of the hollow cavity decreased accordingly. We suppose that because the Pd/Cu catalysts could be captured by the numerous carboxylate groups of PMAA, CMP is thus locally formed on the periphery of the template particles by the catalysis of immobilized metals. As the relative concentrations of the monomers increase, in situ polymerization would further progress from outside to inside, and therefore, the formed shell is thicker and the inner space is reduced. This is an interesting phenomenon resulting from the soft-template-mediated in situ polymerization, and this differs from earlier reported work.4 Additionally, the overall particle size could be reduced to less than 200 nm by using the smaller PMAA microspheres, which provides a possibility for their potential use in vivo (Fig. S5 in ESI†).

Because the PMAA-mediated method could modulate the shell thickness, morphology and nanostructure, its effect on the microporosity was then studied. Through measurement of the N2 isotherm sorption at 77 K, the results, which include surface area and pore volume, are compiled in Table 1. As the shell thickness of H-NCMP increases from 40 to 100 nm, the corresponding surface area is enhanced from 477 to 554 m2 g−1. When the shell thickness was kept at 100 nm, F-NCMP gives a maximum SBET up to 598 m2 g−1. Compared with the hollow microcapsules, the rattle-type Fe3O4@NCMP has a reduced surface area and pore volume, owing to the presence of the Fe3O4 nanocluster with no contribution to the microporosity. All of the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms have almost the same shape (Fig. S6 in ESI†), showing typical type I gas sorption. In accordance to the IUPAC classification, they are of microporous character. Thus, the dominant surface areas and pore volumes are derived from the micropores, and their changing trend is almost synchronized with the total surface areas and pore volumes. Pore size distribution was calculated by the nonlocal density functional theory (NLDFT) model, and all of the samples show main distributions in the micropore size region (Fig. S7 in ESI†). This is a plausible population as a result of the micropore character.

To investigate the photothermal conversion effect, the UV-vis-NIR spectra of a series of samples were recorded, as seen in Fig. 3a. The broad absorption covering the visible and NIR windows was observed for all of the samples at the same concentration of 100 μg mL−1 in phosphate buffered saline (PBS), implying that a large conjugated network within the CMP nanoshell gives rise to the decrease of the energy gap and the red-shift of the absorption towards long wavelengths, as for carbon nanotubes15 and graphene.16 The maximum absorption is found at ∼800 nm, and the absorption ability of F-NCMP-100 is stronger than the others. To verify their potential in photothermal conversion, the sample dispersions in PBS were exposed to an 808 nm NIR laser at a power density of 5 W cm−2 within a short time (Fig. 3b). The PBS aqueous solution just shows a little temperature change. In contrast, the dispersions of the NCMPs enabled a burst increase of temperature upon irradiation with the 808 nm laser for 6 min, and the greatest heating was generated on F-NCMP-100, giving a temperature rise of 24 °C in 6 min. Also, the enhanced shell thickness of H-NCMP is able to improve the photothermal conversion, proving the crucial role of the CMP nanoshell (Fig. S8 in ESI†). When compared to F-NCMP-100 with the same shell thickness, it is very interesting that the rough surface allows for the generation of more heat. We suppose that the oscillating electric field of a light wave acts on the charges to mediate the formation of radiating dipoles within the particles for light scattering. The F-NCMP surface containing many discrete “islands” with small domains of less than 100 nm may enhance the scattering effectiveness and increase the average optical path in the medium, thereby facilitating NIR light absorption for a large photothermal conversion. Prior to determining the efficiency of killing cancer cells, in vitro cytotoxicity assays were performed in the absence of the NIR laser. As shown in Fig. 3c and d, all of the NCMPs have no significant cytotoxic effect on HeLa cells as well as 293T cells (Fig. S9 in ESI†). Also, the estimated hemolysis rates were lower than 5% for various concentrations of NCMPs, indicative of their blood compatibility (Fig. S10 in ESI†). Cell ablation studies were performed by irradiating the cell solutions with an 808 nm laser for 5 min (5 W cm−2) in the presence of the samples. For the two H-NCMPs at a concentration of 100 μg mL−1, the 100 nm CMP shell is responsible for the more pronounced ablation of HeLa cells, giving a cell viability of less than 40%, whereas the F-NCMP could give a cell viability of 10% under identical conditions. This proves again the shape-dependent enhanced photothermal conversion efficiency. When the concentrations increased to 200 μg mL−1, cell viability declined to less than 10%. Furthermore, due to the rapid magnetic responsiveness of Fe3O4@H-NCMP, they could achieve targeted delivery with an applied magnetic field. Besides, we observed the cell states by using a fluorescence microscope. As seen in Fig. 3e–g, the thermal ablation of HeLa cells is effective only upon exposure to NIR with F-NCMP as the photothermal agent.

In summary, we propose a one-step approach for preparing hollow NCMP microcapsules using PMAA as a self-sacrificial template and to modulate the morphology and nanostructure of template particles to achieve the flower-like and rattle-type NCMP microcapsules. Also, with an increase of the thickness of the CMP nanoshell by varying monomer concentrations, the absorption capability in the visible and NIR regions is improved and shows a shape-dependent enhancing tendency. When NIR irradiation (808 nm, 5 W cm−2) is applied to a series of NCMPs in PBS solution, F-NCMP (100 μg mL−1) generates the greatest heat by changing the temperature by 24 °C in 6 min. Also, cell viability assays show that F-NCMP outperforms the other NCMPs in generating heat to destroy HeLa cells in vitro upon irradiation by NIR light. This study confirms a new attractive potential of nanoscale CMPs for medical applications, and also, because of the possibility for drug loading in the pores, they will be useful in multimodal treatment where chemotherapy and hyperthermia are both required.
