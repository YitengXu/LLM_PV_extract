    , Accepted 17th October 2011First published on 19th October 2011AbstractSolution processed polymer/fullerene blend films are receiving extensive attention as the photoactive layer of organic solar cells. In this paper we report a range of photophysical, electrochemical, physicochemical and structural data which provide evidence that formation of a relatively pure, molecularly ordered phase of the fullerene component, phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM), may be the key factor driving the spatial separation of photogenerated electrons and holes in many of these devices. PCBM crystallisation is shown to result in an increase in its electron affinity, providing an energetic driving force for spatial separation of electrons and holes. Based upon our observations, we propose a functional model applicable to many organic bulk heterojunction devices based upon charge generation in a finely intermixed polymer/fullerene phase followed by spatial separation of electrons and holes at the interface of this mixed phase with crystalline PCBM domains. This model has significant implications for the design of alternative acceptor materials to PCBM for organic solar cells.
Introduction
Organic solar cells are attracting increasing interest as a potentially low-cost strategy for solar energy conversion. A key advance in the development of such organic photovoltaic devices was the introduction of the bulk heterojunction (BHJ) concept.1,2 Employing this BHJ approach, extensive progress has been made in the design of new donor polymers which are yielding promising device efficiencies when blended with the soluble fullerene phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM), or its C70 analogue PC70BM. Indeed several low bandgap polymers have recently been reported using this approach which have yielded organic photovoltaic (OPV) device efficiencies >7%.3–5 However, in contrast to these extensive successes in the development of new donor polymers, progress in developing alternative electron acceptors to PCBM/PC70BM has been much more limited to date.6,7
The polymer/PCBM bulk heterojunction film comprising the photoactive layer of such OPV devices is typically most simply described as a two component, bicontinuous blend comprising a polymer and a fullerene phase. The function of such films is then described as light absorption in one or both phases, exciton diffusion to the polymer/fullerene interface, exciton dissociation at this donor/acceptor interface to yield electrons and holes, and transport of these charges through the two phases to the device contacts. However more detailed analyses are increasingly questioning whether this pure polymer phase/pure fullerene phase structural model is appropriate,8–10 with concerns being raised about, for example, phase purity,8 variations in polymer and fullerene crystallinity/aggregation within the film9 and vertical composition profiles.10 As such, there is increasing interest in developing structural and functional models of such devices which take into account more realistic considerations of blend nanomorphology.
This paper is focused particularly upon the functional and structural properties of the PCBM electron acceptor in BHJ organic solar cells. There have been several reports in the literature on the tendency for PCBM to form aggregated domains or crystallites in such polymer/fullerene blend films.11–16 Such aggregate or crystallite formation has been related to the formation both of electron percolation pathways and of enhanced charge separation.17–19 It has also been related to the loss of device efficiency observed following thermal treatments of some bulk heterojunction devices.20,21 Other studies have demonstrated that PCBM can diffuse rapidly through polymer domains, particularly under thermal annealing conditions.10,22–24 Most recently, and of particular relevance to this paper, Piersimoni et al. has correlated a shift in the charge transfer state emission of a PPV/PCBM blend film with the formation of PCBM nanocrystals.25
In this paper, we combine physicochemical, structural and functional data to propose a new factor determining the efficiency of charge separation for these devices. We focus in particular upon the importance of PCBM phase-separating from a finely intermixed phase with the donor polymer to form crystalline fullerene domains, with this phase segregation modulating the electron affinity of PCBM and thereby providing an energetic driving force to enable spatial separation of electrons and holes. We moreover go on to demonstrate that this aggregation induced modulation of electron affinity is rather specific to PCBM, with this shift not being observed for an alternative fullerene acceptor. As such these studies provide a further insight addressing the question of why it has proved so challenging to develop alternative electron acceptors to PCBM for bulk heterojunction solar cells.
Results and discussion
We start by considering evidence that, for most BHJ devices, structural models based upon the formation of pure polymer and pure fullerene domains appear to be inappropriate. There have been several studies addressing the issue of phase composition or ‘purity’ in polymer/fullerene blend films, employing a range of microstructural analysis techniques.12,15,26–30 However probably the simplest evidence for the presence of intimately mixed polymer/fullerene domains in many BHJ films, rather than pure polymer domains, comes from optical data based upon quantitative consideration of polymer photoluminescence (PL) quenching. Typical PL quenching data (i.e.: PL emission data for blend films with PCBM normalised against the PL of the corresponding neat polymer film) are shown in Fig. 1 for a range of donor polymers in 1:1 blends by weight with PCBM or PC70BM. These donor polymers include the semi-crystalline or liquid-crystalline donor polymers, poly(2,5-bis(3-tetradecyllthiophen-2-yl)thieno[3,2,-b]thiophene) (pBTTT),32 poly(3,6-dialkylthieno[3,2-b]thiophene-co-bithiophene (pATBT)31 and poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT),33 as well as the molecularly less ordered polymers, poly[2,8-(6,6,12,12-tetraoctylindenofluorene)-co-5,5-(4′,7′-di-2-thienyl-2′,1′,3′-benzothiodiazole] (IF8TBTT),36 poly[2,1,3-benzothiadiazole-4,7-diyl[4,4-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-4H- cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl]] (PCPDTBT)34 and poly[[9-(1-octylnonyl)-9H-carbazole-2,7-diyl]-2,5-thiophenediyl-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole-4,7-diyl-2,5-thiophenediyl] (PCDTBT).35 In each case, the films were excited near the peak polymer absorption (structures of these polymers and excitation wavelengths are detailed in ESI† Fig. 1). The latter two polymers are examples of low band gap polymers currently yielding promising OPV device efficiencies.37,38 These PL quenching data can be employed to estimate the typical distance L a polymer exciton diffuses before reaching a quenching site (i.e.: a fullerene) from (see ESI† for derivation): L = Lex (1 − PLQ)1/2(1)where PLQ is the fractional PL quenching relative to neat polymer films and Lex the neat polymer exciton diffusion length (defined as the distance an exciton can diffuse within its lifetime in a neat polymer film). Typical values for Lex of neat polymer films are 6–10 nm.39,40 With the exception of P3HT and pATBT, the polymers studied herein exhibited PL quenching of >98%, as is indeed typical for most blend films yielding high OPV device efficiencies.20,41 This high PL quenching yields a value for L ∼ 0.9 nm. We note that this length scale is similar to the size of a monomer unit of most of these polymers, and of the diameter of a single fullerene. As such, we conclude that for these blend films, polymer excitons must be generated effectively directly adjacent to a PCBM molecule, indicative of close molecular mixing of virtually all of the polymer in the film with PCBM on the <1 nm length scale. The notable exceptions to this behaviour are the two semi-crystalline polymers P3HT and pATBT, which exhibit PLQ of only ∼0.85, indicative of an average length scale for exciton diffusion within the blend film of several nanometres, consistent with observations that blend films with these polymers feature relatively well ordered, phase pure crystalline polymer domains.42

:PCBM blend films. Data normalised against PL data for the corresponding neat polymer films. Data is shown for pATBT,31pBTTT,32P3HT,33PCPDTBT,34PCDTBT35 and IF8TBTT.36 Chemical structures of these polymers are detailed in the ESI†. It is apparent that all donors show very strong PL quenching (>98%), except for the two semi-crystalline polymers P3HT and pATBT. 
The key conclusion of these PL quenching data is that for many polymer/PCBM blend films, essentially all the polymer in the film is intimately mixed on a molecular length scale with at least a certain fraction of the PCBM. This conclusion is consistent with recent grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GI-WAXS) and dynamic secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS)8,43 as well as with time resolved studies of ultrafast exciton quenching and charge separation in a range of polymer/fullerene blend films.44–46 This conclusion, however, leaves unresolved the extent and importance of phase segregation in such films, particularly with regard to the PCBM component of the blend film. There is extensive evidence that intimately mixed, single phase polymer/fullerene films exhibit rapid recombination losses, as the electrons and holes are not spatially separated, thereby preventing efficient charge collection.11 For example, we have recently reported a study of charge recombination in blend films of P3HT with a pyrazolinofullerene.47 This fullerene was found to be highly miscible with P3HT, resulting in no observable phase segregation in the blend film. Optical excitation of this single phase, intimately mixed film resulted in efficient photoluminescence quenching but also rapid recombination of the photogenerated charge carriers (on 100 ns and faster timescales), thereby preventing photocurrent generation. Similar conclusions have been reached from studies where the donor and acceptor are covalently attached, thus ensuring molecular scale mixing of donor and acceptor, and again typically fast recombination.48–50 This therefore presents a dilemma. The polymer photoluminescence quenching data above indicates that for many BHJ blend films, there are negligible pure polymer domains of length scale much greater than the individual molecular units. However charge carrier lifetime studies indicate that spatial separation of photogenerated charge carriers is important to enable charge carriers to have sufficient lifetime to be collected by the device electrodes. The remainder of this paper is concerned with addressing this dilemma.
We turn now to consideration of the potential importance of the formation of relatively pure PCBM in such bulk heterojunction blend films. For this purpose, we focus initially upon blend films of PCBM with one donor polymer, pBTTT. This polymer shows high PL quenching (>99%) when blended with PCBM, analogous to the high efficiency polymers PCDTBT and PCPDTBT, indicative of intimate mixing of essentially all the polymer in the film with PCBM. In addition, it has the advantage that the intermixed phase comprises a well-defined pBTTT/PCBM co-crystal, thereby facilitating our structural analyses of such blend films.32

        Optical micrographs and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) thermograms for pBTTT/PCBM blend films are presented in Fig. 2. These data provide clear evidence that at high PCBM content, the excess fullerene that cannot intercalate within the pBTTT/PCBM co-crystal phase separates into PCBM domains, in agreement with previous observations.32Optical microscopy indicates an on-set of melting of neat pBTTT and the pBTTT/PCBM co-crystal at, respectively, ∼230 °C and ∼250 °C, in agreement with thermal analysis. Of particular note for this paper, the DSC data on blends with a content of PCBM ≥44 wt% show a clear melting endotherm for PCBM, assigned to the presence of crystalline PCBM domains in blend films for PCBM compositions above this threshold. The presence of a well-defined melting endotherm is characteristic for the presence of crystalline PCBM domains. This observation of a threshold for formation of these crystalline PCBM domains is also supported by photoluminescence data. We have previously shown that PCBM aggregation can be monitored by the appearance of a new photoluminescence band at ∼520 nm.51 This band is clearly observed in blend film with 75 wt% PCBM, but not at lower PCBM concentrations, as shown in Fig. 3A, again indicative of a composition threshold for PCBM aggregation. We note that our observation of PCBM emissions at both 525 and 720 nm for the 75 wt% blend film, exhibiting only modest (10.5%) quenching relative to neat PCBM films is also indicative of formation of PCBM domains with size comparable to, or greater than, the PCBM singlet exciton diffusion length of 5 nm.52

Melting of the pBTTT/PCBM co-crystal32 as well as neat pBTTT can be inferred from the characteristic red to yellow transition observed at elevated temperatures, in good agreement with the thermal analysis data presented in b. For compositions of 75wt% PCBM, the blend films recrystallise upon heating above 150 °C (see exotherm observed in corresponding heating thermogram presented in b), which leads to a distinct darkening of these architectures. b, Differential scanning calorimetry first heating thermograms of pBTTT/PCBM binaries. The endotherm at ∼280 °C is attributed to melting of crystalline PCBM domains.

/PCBM binary films. a, Photoluminescence data observed following excitation at 430 nm, for films with 0, 50 and 75% PCBM by weight. The broad emission at 800 nm for the neat pBTTT film is assigned to pBTTT singlet emission, which is strongly quenched for PCBM compositions ≥ 20%. Inset, the peak at ∼520 nm was observed only for PCBM compositions > 50% and is assigned to emission of aggregated PCBM.51b, Transient absorption data showing the photoinduced absorption of long lived pBTTT polarons following pulsed laser excitation. A clear composition dependence is observed for the yield of these dissociated polarons, with this yield increasing dramatically for PCBM compositions > 50%. 
The clear composition threshold for the formation of crystalline PCBM domains shown above coincides with thresholds for both charge photogeneration and photovoltaic performance. Fig. 3B shows transient optical data monitoring the absorbance of pBTTT polarons at 980 nm. The observed transients all exhibit power law decays on the 100 ns–100 μs timescale, characteristic of non-geminate recombination of dissociated polarons51 (see ESI† Fig. 6 for more details). It is apparent from Fig. 3B that there is a clear composition threshold for the formation of these dissociated charges, with significantly long lived charge generation only being observed for PCBM compositions ≥ 50 wt%.

Fig. 4A shows the temperature/composition phase diagram for pBTTT/PCBM films determined from the DSC data (first heating thermograms). Fig. 4B overlays the composition dependence of our structural and functional data for pBTTT/PCBM blend films. It is apparent that both short circuit photocurrent (Jsc) and dissociated polaron yield (ΔOD) rapidly increase once the PCBM content exceeds the eutectic composition of the co-crystal/PCBM binary (∼44 wt% PCBM); i.e. at compositions where phase-pure primary PCBM crystals start to develop. Fig. 4B shows that there is a clear correlation between the enthalpy of fusion ΔHf (PCBM) deduced from the corresponding PCBM melting endotherms (indicating the amount of crystalline PCBM present in the blend films) and our functional assays Jsc and ΔOD. In contrast to the development of Jsc and ΔOD, polymer PL quenching saturates at a relatively low PCBM composition, and correlates rather well with co-crystal formation (as indicated most clearly from the appearance of the XRD peak for the co-crystal, see ESI† Fig. 3). This observation is indicative of polymer exciton quenching occurring within the finely intermixed pBTTT/PCBM phase, independent of the formation of separate PCBM domains.

As a consequence the pBTTT/PCBM/co-crystal system features two eutectics: at ∼10 wt% PCBM (pBTTT/co-crystal binary) and 43 wt% PCBM (co-crystal/PCBM binary). Liquids lines were constructed with end melting and end dissolution temperatures of neat components and excess component, respectively, and peak eutectic temperatures. b, Normalised photoluminescence quenching (PLQ), short circuit photocurrent (JSC measured under simulated AM1.5 irradiation) and transient absorption data (ΔOD, measured at a time delay of 1 μs) plotted for pBTTT/PCBM films as a function of blend composition, overlaid with the enthalpies of fusion (ΔHf) of PCBM crystals and the pBTTT/PCBM co-crystals, deduced from the respective first melting endotherms observed in differential scanning calorimetry (see Fig. 2B). 
The enhanced generation of dissociated charge carriers we observe at high PCBM content can not be assigned to enhanced exciton separation, as the photoluminescence data indicates >99% quenching of pBTTT emission even at 50 wt% PCBM. Rather this dependence is assigned to the impact of PCBM domain formation on the dynamics of electron/hole recombination. More specifically, the low yields of dissociated polarons observed for films with low PCBM content is assigned to rapid (<10 ns) electron/hole recombination within the pBTTT/PCBM co-crystal, consistent with our previous observation of rapid charge recombination within intimately mixed polymer/fullerene blends.53 The increase in yield of dissociated polarons at PCBM compositions ≥ 50 wt% is qualitatively consistent with electron transfer to the crystalline PCBM domains, as has been suggested previously.18,54 However the magnitude of the increase in charge carrier lifetime resulting from the formation of these domains (from <10 ns at low PCBM content to >1 μs in the presence of the crystalline PCBM domains) is striking. If we assume a simple model of random electron diffusion between the pBTTT/PCBM co-crystal and the co-existent crystalline PCBM domains, then we would expect an increase in recombination lifetime for a 1:4 blend film of at most fourfold relative to the 1:1 blend film (as the proportion of PCBM in the mixed co-crystal phase changes from ∼100% to ∼25 wt%). In other words, if electrons were free to diffuse between fullerenes in the co-crystal and pure PCBM domains, then such electrons would not be clearly spatially separated from photogenerated polymer polarons, and as such rather fast electron/hole recombination would be expected. One possible explanation for the observed dramatic (at least 100-fold) retardation of recombination kinetics would be that the crystalline PCBM domains are energetic sinks for electrons. This could correspond to the crystalline PCBM domains exhibiting a higher electron affinity than the pBTTT/PCBM co-crystal, with this difference in electron affinity providing the energetic driving force for spatial separation of photogenerated electrons and holes (an alternative explanation could be formation of an interface dipole). Quantitatively a 100 meV shift in electron affinity with PCBM crystallisation would shift the electron equilibrium between co-crystal and crystalline PCBM domains 50 fold, enough to explain the transient data shown in Fig. 3B.
In order to investigate such a shift in PCBM electron affinity, we undertook film cyclic voltammetry (CV) as a function of film composition, as shown in Fig. 5. Data were collected for blends of PCBM with both pBTTT and the insulating polymer polystyrene. We have previously shown that, as for pBTTT, the addition of polystyrene above ∼50% (by weight) prevents PCBM crystallisation/aggregation,51 although for polystyrene this results in a finely intermixed amorphous film rather than the co-crystals observed for pBTTT/PCBM. It is apparent from these CV data that PCBM's crystallisation observed at high PCBM contents is correlated with a conspicuous ∼100–200 meV increase in its electron affinity. This shift is observed for blends with both polymers and is therefore clearly not specific to pBTTT/PCBM binaries but is rather a general property of PCBM.

CV data are shown for neat PCBM films and blends with pBTTT and polystyrene (PS) (respectively, top /middle panel), as well as control data for blends of PS with a less crystalline pyrazolinofullerene (bottom panel). Relative electron affinities were extrapolated from the linear regions of the reduction wave as illustrated. Voltages plotted relative to an Ag/AgCl reference electrode. 
Further control data were obtained with the alternative pyrazolinofullerene used in our previous studies of charge recombination53 again blended with polystyrene. This fullerene showed only a relatively weak 520 nm PL band independent of polystyrene addition (see ESI† Fig. 8), indicative of weak intermolecular couplings even for the neat fullerene film. Consistent with this observation, no (<25 meV) shift of electron affinity with blend composition was observed with this fullerene (Fig. 5A, bottom panel). We thus conclude that the crystalline PCBM domains observed in pBTTT/PCBM blend films at high PCBM compositions indeed exhibit a 100–200 meV shift in their electron affinity relative to non-aggregated PCBM. These observations are consistent with a recent report of a shift in charge transfer state emission with PCBM composition in a PPV/PCBM blend film, with this shift not been observed if PCBM was replaced with the alternative methanofullerene DPM-12.25 Most importantly, the magnitude of the shift in PCBM electron affinity we observe herein is sufficient to achieve a spatial separation of photogenerated electrons and holes, consistent with our observation of long lived, dissociated charge carriers at high PCBM blend compositions, and resulting in the observed composition dependent onset of photocurrent generation.

Fig. 6 summarises our conclusions concerning the structure and function of the bulk heterojunction films studied herein. Our model is based upon the formation of a finely intermixed polymer/fullerene phase, with excess fullerene segregating from this intermixed two-component phase to form relatively pure, crystalline fullerene domains. Functionally the model is based upon light absorption and exciton quenching within the intermixed polymer/fullerene phase, with the fine mixing of polymer and fullerene in this phase resulting in no requirement for exciton diffusion. We note that the Coulomb attraction of photogenerated electrons and holes is likely to significantly impact upon the behaviour of these charge carriers within this mixed phase, including the formation of ‘charge transfer’ states, as has been widely discussed elsewhere.55 Photogenerated electrons then diffuse to the interface between the two-component phase and crystalline PCBM domains (either as dissociated electrons, or as mobile charge transfer states), where the difference in fullerene electron affinity between the two phases stabilises the spatial separation of electron and holes, enabling charge separation with a lifetime sufficient for charge collection. Subsequently the charges are transported to the device electrodes, with electrons most probably travelling through the PCBM domains and holes through the mixed polymer/fullerene phase.
 Fig. 6  
Illustration of function model proposed herein, a, where excitons are generated and separated in the finely mixed polymer/PCBM phase, whilst spatial separation of the electron and holes requires localisation of electrons in the crystalline PCBM domains, with the energy offset between the PCBM LUMO levels in the mixed and pure domains providing an energy difference localising electrons in the pure PCBM domain. b, Illustration of the blend film microstructure proposed, comprising an intimately mixed polymer/PCBM phase (co-crystal, or intimately mixed amorphous phase, i.e. “an amorphous solid solution”) as well as domains of relatively pure, crystalline PCBM. 
Much of our data supporting this model were obtained herein for pBTTT/PCBM blend films. However, it appears likely that this model may be applicable to a broad range of OPV materials systems. The formation of an intimately mixed polymer/PCBM phase appears to be general to many donor polymers we have studied, as evidenced by our polymer PL quenching data, with the notable exception of polymers which show strong tendency to form pure, crystalline polymer domains, such as P3HT and pATBT. Furthermore the formation, at high PCBM compositions, of relatively pure and crystalline PCBM domains with an enhanced electron affinity is clearly not specific to pBTTT/PCBM blend films, as we observe a similar shift in electron affinity with an amorphous, non-conjugated polymer (polystyrene). We note that previous studies have also reported a composition threshold for the formation of crystalline or aggregated PCBM domains in blend films with other donor polymers.11 We furthermore note that we have also previously observed a similar PCBM composition dependence of ΔOD, Jsc and PLQ for an alternative, molecularly relatively unordered polymer, IF8TBTT—with both ΔOD and Jsc increasing markedly above a specific threshold PCBM composition.36 As such, whilst pBTTT may be unusual in forming a polymer/PCBM co-crystal, the concept of a phase segregated blend structure comprising an intimately mixed polymer /PCBM phase (either as a co-crystal or an amorphous solid solution56), and a relatively pure single-component, crystalline PCBM phase, may be applicable to many of the polymer/PCBM films currently of interest for high efficiency OPV devices.
The key component of our model is our observation that relatively pure, crystalline fullerene domains are formed which are of higher electron affinity than the finely intermixed polymer /fullerene phase. We note that the mechanistic origin of this high electron affinity is unclear; as it appears to be rather specific to PCBM, it is more likely to result from particular intermolecular interactions rather than simply from the larger dielectric constant typically reported for fullerenes compared to donor polymers.57 We note in this context that alternative fullerenes investigated for OPV applications, such as the pyrazolinofullerene studied herein, typically show less tendency than PCBM to crystallise, and therefore most probably display relatively invariant electron affinities within such blend films (as evidenced by Fig. 5A, lower panel). This may explain why attempts to use such fullerenes with alternative, molecularly relatively unordered donor polymers, have been relatively unsuccessful to date.7 As such, the tendency of PCBM to form crystalline domains with a higher electron affinity may be a key reasons behind its widespread success in OPV devices.
We note that the success of P3HT as a donor polymer in BHJ solar cells has been widely suggested to result, at least in part, from its strong tendency to form relatively pure crystalline polymer domains that are interconnected through molecularly less ordered, amorphous domains. We have previously shown that such crystallisation reduces P3HT's ionisation potential,33,58 such that these crystalline P3HT domains provide energetic sinks for photogenerated holes. This functions as an additional strategy for achieving the spatial separation of electrons and holes (in addition to the PCBM crystallisation induced shift in electron affinity reported herein), consistent with the observed remarkably slow non-geminate recombination rate constant observed in annealed blend films of these materials.59 As such, P3HT/fullerene blend films may be less functionally dependent upon fullerene crystallisation than other donor polymers. This is consistent with recent observations of efficient OPV device performance for P3HT blends with alternative, less crystalline, fullerenes such as the indene–C 60 bisadduct ICBA,60 but only relatively poor performance when this less crystalline fullerene is blended with less crystalline polymers.
Conclusions
We conclude that a key design requirement of materials for BHJ organic solar cells is their tendency to form phase-pure, crystalline domains which function as energetic sinks for photogenerated charge carriers relative to amorphous or mixed domains. Our results therefore suggest that a key attribute of PCBM, which may be one of the key reasons behind its dominance to date as the electron acceptor in efficient organic BHJ devices, is its ability to both mix with donor polymers, so as to enable efficient exciton quenching, as well as its tendency to form co-existing relatively pure crystalline domains with a higher electron affinity, thereby enabling the spatial separation of photogenerated charges.
Experimental

        pBTTT was synthesized as reported previously (Mw ∼ 66 KDa, Mn 34 KDa).61 Other polymers were synthesised as reported previously31,36,35 except for P3HT purchased from Reike and PCPDTBT and PCDTBT purchased from 1-Material. PCBM was purchased from Solenne and used as received. Synthesis of the pyrazolinofullerene derivative has been reported previously.17 Solutions were typically prepared by dissolving the solids in ortho-dichlorobenzene (oDCB, Aldrich) and left stirring for more than 4 h at 100 °C to fully dissolve the polymer. Films were deposited on glass by spin coating from a hot solution (100 °C). Devices were prepared as described previously,62 depositing PEDOT:PSS onto ITO (Psiotech) before depositing the active layer from a hot solution (100 °C) and vacuum evaporation of the aluminium electrodes. Photoluminescence quenching was measured using a steady state spectrofluorimeter (Horiba Jobin Yvon, Spex Flouromax 1), all films were deposited on glass and excited at their absorption maxima. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements were conducted under nitrogen at scan rate of 20 °C min−1 with a Mettler Toledo DSC822 instrument. Neat material and blend powders were produced by preparing homogeneous solutions of 1 wt% total material content in oDCB, followed by casting onto glass slides at 35 °C. The solvent was evaporated at ambient pressure in air. 2–4 mg material from such films was used for the DSC experiments. Complete melting of primary crystals as well as melting of the neat materials correspond to the end melting temperatures in the DSC thermograms. Transmission optical microscopy was carried out with an OLYMPUS BX51 microscope equipped with a Mettler Toledo FP82HT hot stage that was continuously flushed with nitrogen. Transient absorption (TA) decays were measured as previously, employing an excitation at 520 nm (8 μJ cm−2). Film cyclic voltammagrams were recorded between +1.5 V and −1.5 V for each film, employing a 0.1M tetrabutylammonium perchlorate (Alfa Aesar) in acetonitrile (Aldrich) electrolyte. Data are shown for a scan rate of 100 mV s−1, although qualitatively similar data were obtained at slower scan speeds (10 mV s−1). The counter and reference electrodes were Pt and Ag/AgCl respectively.

 	Fig. 1  
Photoluminescence quenching data for 1:1 
polymer
:PCBM blend films. Data normalised against PL data for the corresponding neat polymer films. Data is shown for pATBT,31pBTTT,32P3HT,33PCPDTBT,34PCDTBT35 and IF8TBTT.36 Chemical structures of these polymers are detailed in the ESI†. It is apparent that all donors show very strong PL quenching (>98%), except for the two semi-crystalline polymers P3HT and pATBT.	 

 	Fig. 2  
Thermal behaviour as function of blend composition for 
pBTTT
/PCBM binaries. a, Transmission optical micrographs of solution-cast pBTTT/PCBM films which were then heated to different temperatures at a rate of 10 °C min−1. Melting of the pBTTT/PCBM co-crystal32 as well as neat pBTTT can be inferred from the characteristic red to yellow transition observed at elevated temperatures, in good agreement with the thermal analysis data presented in b. For compositions of 75wt% PCBM, the blend films recrystallise upon heating above 150 °C (see exotherm observed in corresponding heating thermogram presented in b), which leads to a distinct darkening of these architectures. b, Differential scanning calorimetry first heating thermograms of pBTTT/PCBM binaries. The endotherm at ∼280 °C is attributed to melting of crystalline PCBM domains.	 

 	Fig. 3  
Blend composition dependence of photoluminescence (
PL
) and dissociated polaron yield (
ΔOD
) for 
pBTTT
/PCBM binary films. a, Photoluminescence data observed following excitation at 430 nm, for films with 0, 50 and 75% PCBM by weight. The broad emission at 800 nm for the neat pBTTT film is assigned to pBTTT singlet emission, which is strongly quenched for PCBM compositions ≥ 20%. Inset, the peak at ∼520 nm was observed only for PCBM compositions > 50% and is assigned to emission of aggregated PCBM.51b, Transient absorption data showing the photoinduced absorption of long lived pBTTT polarons following pulsed laser excitation. A clear composition dependence is observed for the yield of these dissociated polarons, with this yield increasing dramatically for PCBM compositions > 50%.	 

 	Fig. 4  
Physicochemical, structural and optoelectronic characteristics as function of 
pBTTT
/PCBM blend composition. a, Temperature /composition diagram of the pBTTT/PCBM system, showing formation of a molecular compound (co-crystal) at a PCBM content of ∼40 wt%. As a consequence the pBTTT/PCBM/co-crystal system features two eutectics: at ∼10 wt% PCBM (pBTTT/co-crystal binary) and 43 wt% PCBM (co-crystal/PCBM binary). Liquids lines were constructed with end melting and end dissolution temperatures of neat components and excess component, respectively, and peak eutectic temperatures. b, Normalised photoluminescence quenching (PLQ), short circuit photocurrent (JSC measured under simulated AM1.5 irradiation) and transient absorption data (ΔOD, measured at a time delay of 1 μs) plotted for pBTTT/PCBM films as a function of blend composition, overlaid with the enthalpies of fusion (ΔHf) of PCBM crystals and the pBTTT/PCBM co-crystals, deduced from the respective first melting endotherms observed in differential scanning calorimetry (see Fig. 2B).

Cyclic voltammetry
 (CV) data for 
fullerene

polymer
 /
fullerene
 blend films. CV data are shown for neat PCBM films and blends with pBTTT and polystyrene (PS) (respectively, top /middle panel), as well as control data for blends of PS with a less crystalline pyrazolinofullerene (bottom panel). Relative electron affinities were extrapolated from the linear regions of the reduction wave as illustrated. Voltages plotted relative to an Ag/AgCl reference electrode.	 

 	Fig. 6  
Illustration of function model proposed herein, a, where excitons are generated and separated in the finely mixed polymer/PCBM phase, whilst spatial separation of the electron and holes requires localisation of electrons in the crystalline PCBM domains, with the energy offset between the PCBM LUMO levels in the mixed and pure domains providing an energy difference localising electrons in the pure PCBM domain. b, Illustration of the blend film microstructure proposed, comprising an intimately mixed polymer/PCBM phase (co-crystal, or intimately mixed amorphous phase, i.e. “an amorphous solid solution”) as well as domains of relatively pure, crystalline PCBM.
