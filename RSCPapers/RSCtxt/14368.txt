Marconi 446, 00146, Rome, ItalyReceived 5th August 2013, Accepted 22nd August 2013First published on 23rd August 2013AbstractHighly efficient and transparent multicomponent catalysts for Dye Solar Cells (DSCs) were obtained by simultaneous electrodeposition of platinum and cobalt-sulfide (Pt:CoS) on conducting glass substrates from a mixture solution of both precursors. At equal charge transfer resistances (RCT), the superior transparency of electrodeposited (ED) Pt:CoS compared to ED Pt-only and ED CoS-only was attributed to the synergic combination of a very thin CoS layer and a fine dispersion of Pt nanoparticles. The highly catalytic properties of Pt:CoS with less electrodeposited material consumption, carried out at room temperature, can represent a fast and energy saving fabrication process, also compatible with flexible plastic substrates. In fact, DSCs with the ED Pt:CoS counterelectrodes showed the highest power conversion efficiency in back illumination, which is the configuration used for flexible metallic and bifacial DSCs during operation, gaining on average almost 14% and 7% in device efficiency with respect to ED CoS-only and ED Pt-only based cells. These results are important for all applications where transparency represents a key factor (e.g. BIPV, metal based devices) and may also point at blending different precursor solutions as a more general route for electrodeposition of layers with added functionality.1. IntroductionDye Solar Cells (DSCs)1 represent an attractive photovoltaic technology, developed so far both on glass and flexible substrates. Usually opaque metallic foils are chosen as photoanodes in flexible DSCs so that high temperature sintering of the TiO2 can be carried out to obtain efficient devices.2 For example, G24i Power Limited, a commercial producer of flexible DSCs, makes its devices using metal foil. The corresponding counterelectrode (CE) has to be endowed with high transparency to minimize optical losses due to the necessary back illumination of the cell as shown in Fig. 1a. The overall device transparency is also considered to be an important requirement for engineers and architects even for front-illuminated applications (Fig. 1b), such as flexible photovoltaic greenhouses and photovoltaic glass facades, where light transmission is sought to improve aesthetics, interior habitability3 and the energy efficiency of buildings.4 Fig. 1  Schematics of DSCs that gain advantages from using highly transparent counterelectrodes: (a) flexible DSCs on metallic foil, where illumination occurs through the counterelectrode since the photoanode is opaque; (b) transparent glass-based DSCs for BIPV applications where high transparency is required for aesthetic and habitability reasons. So far, CE materials, including platinum (the most common),5 carbon-based materials,6,7 polymers,8–10 carbides,11 nitrides,12 and oxides,13 have been deposited by sputtering,14,15 printing,5,16 spray coating,12 chemical reduction,17,18 UV-assisted reduction19 and electrochemical deposition (ED).20Since Kim et al.21 demonstrated the simple, low-cost and low-temperature method of electrodeposition to obtain Pt counterelectrodes on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass substrates, many researchers have focused their efforts to understand and optimize the ED process both on glass,22 leading to a performance even greater than sputtered Pt,23 and on conductive plastic substrates.24 Since the technique can be carried out at room temperature, it is not only compatible with plastic substrates25 but also recommended to reduce the embodied energy of the technology.26In more recent years, other materials have been electrodeposited successfully including nickel sulfide,27 PEDOT:PSS28,29 and CoS.30Cobalt sulfide (CoS) via electrodeposition has been shown to be as efficient as sputtered Pt in plastic DSCs30 and has since attracted strong interest.31,32 In these investigations, however, CoS was utilized in front-illumination devices so its transparency was not a requirement.In this paper we report for the first time that, by simultaneous electrodeposition from a solution containing a blend of both platinum and cobalt sulfide precursors, an efficient and highly transparent counterelectrode (ED Pt:CoS) is obtained, that gives, with the same RCT, greater overall transparencies and back-illuminated power conversion efficiencies compared to cells fabricated with the standard electrodeposited homogeneous Pt or CoS counterparts.2. ExperimentalFTO glass samples (Pilkington, 8 Ω □−1) were ultrasonically cleaned sequentially in acetone and in isopropyl alcohol for 10 minutes. Electrodeposition was carried out using a G300 potentiostat/galvanostat (Gamry Instruments Inc.) and a purpose-built three-electrode system comprising FTO-glass with an exposed area of 4 × 2 cm2 as the working electrode, a Pt wire as the counterelectrode and Ag/AgCl electrode as the reference electrode. The distance between the working and counterelectrode was set at 2 cm. Three aqueous solutions were prepared: (i) 10 mM H2PtCl6, 10 mM KCl;21 (ii) 5 mM CoCl2·6H2O, 0.75 mM thiourea;31 and (iii) our blend system containing 10 mM H2PtCl6, 5 mM CoCl2·6H2O, 10 mM KCl, 0.75 mM thiourea. All the solvents and chemical reagents were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. Electrodeposition conditions were chosen and set in order to obtain the same RCT (within ±10%) for all the samples. Potentiodynamic electrodeposition of platinum was performed by voltage linear sweeping from −0.8 V to 0 V, with a scan rate of 25 mV s−1, in solution (i). Similarly, a linear sweep in voltage from −1.2 V to 0.2 V, with a scan rate of 0.5 mV s−1, in solution (ii) was employed for electrodeposition of cobalt sulfide. Finally, simultaneous electrodeposition of platinum and cobalt sulfide was carried out by five linear voltage sweeps from −1.2 V to 0 V, with a scan rate of 5 mV s−1, in solution (iii), after it had changed from clear to cloudy. After deposition, all the substrates were rinsed with deionized water and dried at 100 °C for 10 minutes. For comparison, high temperature pyrolytic Pt (HT Pt) counterelectrodes were prepared by pyrogenic decomposition at 420 °C for 15 minutes of a screen-printed chloroplatinic acid precursor paste (Pt10 004F-05, Chimet).Photoelectrodes were obtained by screen-printing opaque single-layer TiO2 (18 NR-AO paste, Dyesol) with a thickness of 8 μm on the FTO-glass substrate. Over each 4 × 2 cm2 glass sample, three TiO2 active areas of 0.5 × 0.5 cm2 were deposited and electrically isolated from each other by laser scribing the FTO. The electrodes were then sintered in an oven with a final step at 525 °C for 30 min. After overnight immersion in a 0.3 mM ethanol solution of N719 dye (Dyesol), photoelectrodes were assembled with different counterelectrodes prepared using a thermoplastic gasket (Surlyn 25, Solaronix). Finally a commercial electrolyte (EL-HSE, Dyesol) was injected by vacuum back-filling. No secondary encapsulants were utilised. All devices were assembled in air.Scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Zeiss) was used to study the morphology of the different counterelectrodes. The optical transmittance spectra were recorded using a spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-Vis 2550) coupled to an integrating sphere. To investigate the catalytic activity of the samples for tri-iodide reduction, the charge transfer resistance (RCT) at the electrolyte/counterelectrode interface was measured by means of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), performed on symmetrical cells with two identical electrodes sealed together by a 25 μm thick Surlyn and filled with the same commercial electrolyte (EL-HSE, Dyesol) used for complete cells. The EIS tests were carried out in the dark at 0 V, employing an AUTOLAB 302N potentiostat (Metrohm) and Nova electrochemical interface system. The frequency range was 20 Hz to 1 MHz and the amplitude of the a.c. voltage was 10 mV. RCT was obtained by fitting the arc observed at high frequency in Nyquist plots to the equivalent circuit of the symmetrical cell. ZView2 software was employed for the equivalent circuit analysis.The chemical composition of the electrodeposited samples was investigated by X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) performed on a Perkin Elmer 32095 apparatus using monochromatic Al Kα radiation and a hemispherical electron energy analyzer. All the samples were analyzed after exposure to ambient air. Preliminary XPS spectra were acquired on the bare FTO substrate.The photovoltaic performance of the cells was measured with a computer-controlled Keithley 2420 source meter, under a solar simulator (SolarTest 1200 KHS Class B) at 1000 W m−2, AM 1.5; before measurement, a black 0.7 × 0.7 cm2 adhesive mask was applied over each cell. Incident Photon-to-Current Efficiency (IPCE) measurements were carried out using a set-up consisting of a 150 W xenon lamp (Newport Model 70612) coupled to a monochromator (Cornerstone 130) and a Keithley 2420 source meter.3. Results and discussionCounterelectrodes with the same RCT were obtained by electrodeposition starting from solutions of (i) a Pt precursor (ED Pt), (ii) a CoS precursor (ED CoS) and (iii) a blend of both (ED Pt:CoS). The CEs were assembled to fabricate complete DSCs, measured in front and back illumination and also compared to platinized CEs prepared using high-temperature pyrolytic Pt (HT Pt).3.1. Characterization of counterelectrodesElectrochemical impedance spectra of symmetric CE/electrolyte/CE cells with the different CEs are shown in Fig. 2. The equivalent circuit used for data fitting comprises the following elements: an Ohmic series resistance (RS), mainly due to the TCO, a charge-transfer resistance (RCT) and a constant phase element (CPE) associated with the CE/electrolyte interface, and a Nernst diffusion impedance (ZN) that describes the diffusion of I3− in the electrolyte. The use of a CPE instead of a capacitor reflected the uneven and textured surface of the catalyst-coated FTO glass.33 Since the electrolyte thickness in symmetrical cells and its chemical composition were the same for all samples, ZN values are not shown. Fig. 2  Nyquist plots of symmetrical CE/electrolyte/CE cells with different counterelectrodes (CE) and the equivalent circuit used for data fitting. Deposition was carried out in such a way to make sure that for all electrodeposited CEs RCT was the same within ±10% and was equal to 2 ohm cm2 (Table 1). The impedance spectrum and RCT value of the reference HT Pt CEs are also shown, revealing a lower RCT of 1.2 ohm cm2 but also a lower transparency compared to the ED CEs containing Pt, since HT Pt was developed specifically for glass based front-illuminated devices only. As we will show later, these differences in RCT, when RCT ≤ 2 ohm cm2 which represents a low enough value for good catalytic activity,34,35 do not affect device power conversion efficiencies.

The HT Pt reference (Fig. 3b) showed a homogeneous distribution of small individual Pt nanoparticles and larger round agglomerates of a few tens of nm in diameter. The ED Pt electrode (Fig. 3c) was characterized by well dispersed 2–10 nm-sized nanoparticles and some much larger spherical aggregates of up to ∼400 nm in diameter. A striking different morphology was observed for the ED CoS counterelectrode (Fig. 3d): rather than growing in isolated islands, the FTO substrate was completely covered by a nano/meso-structured surface, similar to that reported in the literature.36 Such a high surface area morphology assures good catalytic activity but the CoS greater thickness lowers the counterelectrode transparency considerably as shown in Fig. 4: the average transmittance loss in the visible range (400–800 nm) was at least 17% compared to the bare FTO glass substrate, almost 10% higher than for HT Pt and 15% compared to ED Pt. Fig. 3  SEM images of bare FTO glass (a) and different counterelectrodes: screen printed Pt precursor paste and sintered at high temperature, HT Pt (b); electrodeposited Pt, ED Pt (c); electrodeposited CoS, ED CoS (d); electrodeposited Pt and CoS blend, ED Pt:CoS (e and f).  Fig. 4  Transmittance spectra of the electrodeposited catalysts on FTO glass substrates (dashed line: ED Pt, electrodeposited platinum; dot-dashed line: ED CoS, electrodeposited cobalt sulfide; short dotted line: ED Pt:CoS, electrodeposited blend of platinum and cobalt sulfide). For comparison the spectra of a bare FTO glass (solid line) and of a platinum layer obtained by thermal firing at 420 °C for 15 minutes (dotted line: SP-HT Pt, screen printed and high temperature treated platinum) are also reported. Finally, the morphology of the ED Pt:CoS blend sample (Fig. 3e and f) presented a large number of small nanoparticles of platinum, appearing quite similar to that of ED Pt but without any trace of the considerably larger aggregates. The image also hints to the presence of a thin coating of CoS with some flakes, similar in shape to the homogeneous ED CoS layer (Fig. 3f) that covered the FTO grains but a thinner layer. The ED Pt:CoS proved to be the most transparent of all counterelectrodes, including all the other ED catalysts and even the HT Pt reference. Furthermore, remarkably, it was only 2% less transparent than the bare FTO glass substrate.Whereas SEM gives an indication on morphology, we carried out XPS, a technique which conclusively yields chemical analysis, to better understand the composition and prove and quantify the presence of both Pt and CoS on the blend sample.XPS measurements were performed on ED CoS, ED Pt and ED Pt:CoS samples and are compared in Fig. 5. The spectra were acquired after sample exposure to air. Concerning the Pt film, the most intense peak present in the spectra is due to the emission from the Pt 4f core level and no response in the Co or S region is present. The CoS sample shows significant emissions corresponding to the Co and S energy regions and none at the Pt one. Instead, the ED Pt:CoS sample exhibits emission peaks for all three Co, S and Pt core level elements revealing that the implemented procedure of simultaneous electrodeposition of cobalt sulfide and platinum had successfully coated the FTO with both Pt and CoS. Fig. 5  XPS spectra in the (a) Co 2p, (b) S 2p and (c) Pt 4f energy regions taken on ED CoS (open diamonds, bottom), ED Pt:CoS (open squares, middle), and ED Pt (open circles, top) samples. The inset in (a) shows the high resolution Co 2p3/2 spectrum taken on an ED CoS film. As shown in Fig. 5a, the Co 2p spectrum of the ED CoS sample has two main peaks corresponding to the 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 emissions centered at about 782 and 799 eV. The high resolution 2p3/2 spectrum is shown in the inset and indicates the presence in the Co emissions of at least two components centered at 778.6 and 781.6 eV respectively, compatible with the presence not only of Co–S but also of Co–O species in the sample, in agreement with results reported in the literature.36–38 The 2p peak of the blend is much broader which indicates that the emissions relative to Co–O and Co–S bonds have considerably larger widths in the ED Pt:CoS sample. This is compatible with a considerably lower film thickness of the CoS component in ED Pt:CoS compared to the ED CoS-only film due to the noticeable relevance of the surface components in the XPS technique and/or increased disorder.In Fig. 5b XPS curves in the S 2p energy regions are reported for all three samples. In both the ED CoS and ED Pt:CoS samples two peaks are present; the most intense peak is centered at 158 eV and is relative to the Co–S bond. The presence of the peak at higher binding energy indicates that sulfur oxide or sulfur bonded to impurities is present in both the ED CoS and ED Pt:CoS air-exposed samples.38 However the ED Pt:CoS sample shows a lower percentage of S bonded to O with respect to the ED CoS sample. Since it is CoS (rather than S bonded to other species like O) which has been shown to be an efficient catalyst for tri-iodide reduction, this is likely to be beneficial to the catalytic activity of the ED Pt:CoS layer.Finally, in Fig. 5c curves relative to the Pt 4f regions are shown. In the two spectra relative to samples containing Pt, contributions of the 4f7/2 and 4f5/2 components are visible. The 4f7/2 peaks are centered at 66.3 and 67 eV for the ED Pt and ED Pt:CoS respectively, the 4f peaks being broader in the latter sample than those found in the film containing only Pt. This broadening is likely due to a different distribution of Pt in its various oxidation states.39 Indeed the preliminary analysis of the high resolution 4f spectra reveals a higher ratio of Pt in its high oxidation states over Pt(0) in the ED Pt:CoS film with respect to the ED Pt film. Although this may also be due to the presence of Pt–S species in the former, it likely indicates a higher surface-to-volume ratio of Pt in the ED Pt:CoS film (assuming that Pt(0) arises mainly from the internal volume of the Pt islands), which is conducive to greater catalytic activity. Smaller Pt structures for the ED Pt:CoS CEs are in fact also seen in the SEM images of Fig. 3. A more detailed analysis of high resolution spectra will be undertaken in the future to investigate the chemical makeup further.On top of the above chemical analysis, XPS also permits a quantitative estimate of the film thickness. From the intensity ratio between the signals from the FTO substrate and catalyst film, modeling the ED CoS as a uniform layer, we estimated an equivalent thickness of about 10 nm. This value is in accordance with the value of 14 nm calculated by the Beer–Lambert law from the measured transmittance spectrum, assuming the CoS absorption coefficient (at ∼550 nm) to be around 1.3 × 105 cm−1.31,32 For the ED Pt:CoS sample, the estimated equivalent thickness for the CoS component from XPS data was 0.2–0.5 nm.As reported in the literature, there is often an inverse proportionality between optical transparency and the charge transfer resistance at the CE/electrolyte interface: thicker films are usually more effective for both Pt22 and CoS.31 The ED Pt:CoS samples instead exhibit the appealing combination of superior transparency, compared to the homogeneous ED Pt-only and ED CoS-only counterparts, while assuring the same low RCT. Fig. 6 shows a schematic representation of the electrodeposited films based on estimations from the SEM and XPS data. The superior transparency/catalytic activity combination of the ED Pt:CoS sample (Fig. 6c) was attributed to the synergic action of both CoS film, thinner than ED CoS-only but still contributing to charge transfer of the ED Pt:CoS because it overlays the whole large area of the sample, and the Pt nanoparticles, smaller and more homogeneously distributed than in the ED Pt-only. Significantly and additionally, the ED Pt:CoS results in less material usage at the same RCT thereby reducing material costs. Fig. 6  Simplified schematics (not to scale) of the estimated morphology of the electrodeposited samples in cross-section, as gathered from transmittance, SEM and XPS analysis. The ED Pt counterelectrode presents a distribution of Pt particles and aggregates ranging from a few nm to hundreds of nm. The ED CoS sample shows a rather opaque 10–14 nm layer of CoS covering the FTO substrate. The ED Pt:CoS counterelectrode presents a much thinner CoS layer (0.2–0.5 nm) and smaller Pt nanoparticles compared to the ED Pt-only sample, assuring at the same RCT higher transparency together with lower material consumption, and improving power conversion efficiency in back illuminated devices, where light is incident on these counterelectrodes. 3.2 Characterization of DSCs with ED Pt:CoS, ED Pt and ED CoS counterelectrodesThe electrodeposited samples were used as CEs for the fabrication of DSCs. The photovoltaic performance under standard AM1.5G, 1000 W m−2 conditions was measured both with the light incident on the photoanode (front illumination, Table 1) and on the counterelectrode (back illumination, Table 1 and Fig. 7a). Solar energy conversion efficiencies, η, under front illumination were practically equal for all electrodeposited CE-based DSCs (e.g. DSCs with ED Pt:CoS CEs, η = 6.15 ± 0.07%). This is expected since different CEs had the same RCT values. Note also that η was also as high as that of the reference cells equipped with HT Pt CEs. Fig. 7  Solar energy conversion efficiency (a) and incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (b) of DSCs assembled with different CEs and measured under back illumination conditions. Significantly the performance was different under back illumination, however, since the transparency of the CE comes into play. A similar trend was observed in the IPCE data: for front illuminated cells, the differences in IPCE curves were negligible (data not shown). For back illuminated cells, instead, IPCE drops with increasing counterelectrode opacity (Fig. 7b), confirming the J–V data and also showing why efficiencies of back illuminated cells are lower than front illuminated cells, since the electrolyte absorbs light strongly below 500 nm.The DSCs with the ED Pt:CoS counterelectrode showed the highest efficiency (4.5%), due to their higher transparency leading to higher photocurrents. Those devices gained on average almost 14% and 7% in device efficiency with respect to ED CoS and ED Pt based cells, respectively, and even 3% towards HT Pt (which however requires high temperatures which are not applicable to plastic counterelectrodes), confirming that there is a trade-off between RCT and T%: a less catalytic but more transparent CE (ED Pt:CoS) can operate as well as a more catalytic but less transparent CE (HT Pt), at least for these current levels. Furthermore, at the same RCT and with the other DSC components being equal, a more transparent CE yields higher efficiencies in back illuminated devices, regardless of the catalyst material. The efficiency enhancement utilizing ED Pt:CoS counterelectrodes is significant because back-illumination occurs in many applications such as metal based DSCs where, furthermore, high temperature pyrolytic reduction of Pt cannot be utilized on the plastic CEs.4. ConclusionsWe reported the successful introduction of blending Pt and CoS precursors to obtain highly catalytic electrodeposited counterelectrodes (CEs) with superior optical transparency, close to that of bare FTO-glass, by simple, room temperature, potentiodynamic electrodeposition.DSCs equipped with ED Pt:CoS CEs on FTO substrates performed better (by 14% and 7%, respectively) under back illumination compared to DSCs equipped with ED Pt-only and ED CoS-only CEs. We believe that such features and the compatibility of the electrodeposition process with flexible plastic substrates make ED Pt:CoS a promising candidate for use in low cost flexible DSCs, especially for fully semitransparent DSCs and for back illuminated devices with metal based photoanodes.Furthermore, both Pt and CoS loading were reduced, while maintaining an uncompromising level of catalytic power leading to higher transparency, higher performance, lower material consumption and potentially lower production costs compared to the existing alternatives.AcknowledgementsThis work was financially supported by a grant from Regione Lazio ‘Polo Solare Organico Regione Lazio’ and the Italian Ministero dell'Istruzione, dell'Università e della Ricerca MIUR through ‘Progetto PRIN 2009 PRAM8L-Innovative materials for organic and hybrid photovoltaics’.ReferencesB.

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  Schematics of DSCs that gain advantages from using highly transparent counterelectrodes: (a) flexible DSCs on metallic foil, where illumination occurs through the counterelectrode since the photoanode is opaque; (b) transparent glass-based DSCs for BIPV applications where high transparency is required for aesthetic and habitability reasons.	 

 	Fig. 2  Nyquist plots of symmetrical CE/electrolyte/CE cells with different counterelectrodes (CE) and the equivalent circuit used for data fitting.

 	Fig. 3  SEM images of bare FTO glass (a) and different counterelectrodes: screen printed Pt precursor paste and sintered at high temperature, HT Pt (b); electrodeposited Pt, ED Pt (c); electrodeposited CoS, ED CoS (d); electrodeposited Pt and CoS blend, ED Pt:CoS (e and f).	 

 	Fig. 4  Transmittance spectra of the electrodeposited catalysts on FTO glass substrates (dashed line: ED Pt, electrodeposited platinum; dot-dashed line: ED CoS, electrodeposited cobalt sulfide; short dotted line: ED Pt:CoS, electrodeposited blend of platinum and cobalt sulfide). For comparison the spectra of a bare FTO glass (solid line) and of a platinum layer obtained by thermal firing at 420 °C for 15 minutes (dotted line: SP-HT Pt, screen printed and high temperature treated platinum) are also reported.	 

 	Fig. 5  XPS spectra in the (a) Co 2p, (b) S 2p and (c) Pt 4f energy regions taken on ED CoS (open diamonds, bottom), ED Pt:CoS (open squares, middle), and ED Pt (open circles, top) samples. The inset in (a) shows the high resolution Co 2p3/2 spectrum taken on an ED CoS film.	 

 	Fig. 6  Simplified schematics (not to scale) of the estimated morphology of the electrodeposited samples in cross-section, as gathered from transmittance, SEM and XPS analysis. The ED Pt counterelectrode presents a distribution of Pt particles and aggregates ranging from a few nm to hundreds of nm. The ED CoS sample shows a rather opaque 10–14 nm layer of CoS covering the FTO substrate. The ED Pt:CoS counterelectrode presents a much thinner CoS layer (0.2–0.5 nm) and smaller Pt nanoparticles compared to the ED Pt-only sample, assuring at the same RCT higher transparency together with lower material consumption, and improving power conversion efficiency in back illuminated devices, where light is incident on these counterelectrodes.	 

 	Fig. 7  Solar energy conversion efficiency (a) and incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (b) of DSCs assembled with different CEs and measured under back illumination conditions.
