1. Introduction
Very recently, investigators have aimed to design high-efficiency, clean energy storage and conversion devices. It is obligatory to satisfy the needs of the rapidly growing portable electronic device field.1 Usually, the performance of the electronic devices depends on the function-cum-abilities of their key components. Among the key components, the electrode material plays a vital role in deciding the capabilities of the electronic devices.2 Nowadays, the supercapacitor is the most intensely investigated energy storage and conversion device because it works in between batteries and fuel cells and has the merits of both. Supercapacitors provide long cycle life, better safety, high power density, and higher energy density than capacitors.3 Supercapacitors can be classified into three types: (1) electrical double-layer capacitors, which function based on charge separation at the electrode surface, for example graphene and carbon-based materials;4 (2) pseudocapacitors, which work based on the intercalation/deintercalation of electrolyte ions with partial redox process, for example conductive polymers and metal oxides;5,6 (3) battery-type supercapacitors, with strong redox peaks (faradaic process), for example metal sulfides, metal oxides etc.7 Usually, supercapacitors have very high power density, fast cycling with stability, etc., but suffer from poor energy density. The drawbacks of supercapacitors are overcome by battery-like supercapacitor materials because they have faster surface redox reactions.
In recent years, transition metal sulfides have emerged as potential materials in a variety of applications such as solar cells, catalysis, sensors, batteries, and supercapacitors.8 They are suitable candidates for battery-like supercapacitor applications because they have lower electronegativity and are more highly electrochemically active than conventional metal oxides.9 Various naturally occurring layered and non-layered metal sulfides have been reported as having supercapacitor applications. Among them, CuS is a widely attractive material in a variety of applications. It has a narrow band gap energy of 2.0 eV, and good electronic conductivity, and is environmentally benign, easy to prepare, cheaper and naturally available in the Earth's crust.10 So far, different morphologies of CuS such as nanoneedles,11 hierarchical structures,12 nanoplatelets,13 nanowires,14 microspheres,15 3D hierarchical microspheres,16 nanosheets,17 nanowalls,18 nanoribbons,19 flower-like,20 nanostructures,21 nanoparticles, nanofibers,22 nanoflower,10,23 nanospheres,24 nano hollow spheres,25 and double-shell nanocages3 have been carefully developed for supercapacitor applications. As well as the various morphologies of CuS, composites of CuS with carbon nanotubes (CNTs),11 reduced graphene oxide (rGO),20,26–28 polypyrrole,29 bacterial cellulose,30 carbon quantum dots,31 Cu(OH)232 and Ni3S233 have been reported for improvement of supercapacitor applications. Still, some of the problems are unsolved. Further attention is needed to improve the capacitance of CuS.
Among the various metal hydroxides, Ni(OH)2 is a good candidate for electrochemical applications owing to its merits of high theoretical capacitance, environment friendliness, low cost, different morphologies, etc. Moreover, the layered structure of Ni(OH)2 is helpful in providing a more active site for the dissemination of electrolyte ions. Ni(OH)2 thus develops the electrochemical performance of these materials. However, the poor electronic conductivity of Ni(OH)2 effectively hinders the improvement of capacitance in practical uses.
Nowadays, metal sulfide/metal hydroxide materials with core–shell-like hybrid structure are long-established supercapacitor materials.34 They have provided a wealth of electrochemically active materials directly grown on the surface of the substrate, which offer the benefits of faster cycling, improved capacitance, and better rate capability compared with the pure metal sulfides. To our knowledge, there have been few reports about nickel hydroxide-modified metal sulfides such as Co9S8@Ni(OH)2,35 NiCo2S4@Ni(OH)236 and Ni3S2@Ni(OH)237 as electrode materials for supercapacitors. Herein, we present results for electrodeposited Ni(OH)2@CuS as an electrode material for supercapacitor applications.
In this present study, we have designed and fabricated a CuS (core) and Ni(OH)2 shell-like hybrid for use in binder-free electrodes for ultra-high-performance supercapacitors. Core–shell-like hybrids of CuS@Ni(OH)2 – 5 minutes delivered a capacitance of 3585 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1 with improved cycle stability in the 4000th cycle.
2. Experimental
2.1 Synthesis of CuS nanosheets
In a typical synthesis, 0.1486 g of CuSO4·6H2O and 1.0852 g of urea were dissolved in 70 ml of Millipore water, and the solution was transferred into a Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave. A piece of precleaned Ni-Foam (1 × 1 cm2) was added to this solution inside the autoclave. The reaction was heated at 150 °C for 12 h in a hot air oven. After cooling to room temperature, the CuO-covered Ni-Foam was washed several times with water and ethanol and dried at 80 °C for 12 h. The CuO-covered Ni-Foam was placed in a solution of 10 mmol of sodium sulfide in 50 ml Millipore water for an hour. During this sulfidation process, the CuO covering the Ni-Foam was completely converted into CuS. After that, the Cu–S-covered Ni-Foam was washed in water and dried at 80 °C for 12 h. The mass loading of CuS was 2.5 mg for each electrode.
2.2 Electrodeposition of Ni(OH)2
Electrodeposition of Ni(OH)2 was carried out using a three-electrode system, which consisted of Ag/AgCl, Pt, and CuS@Ni-Foam as reference, counter, and working electrodes respectively, in an Autolab instrument. In this process, 10 mmol of NiCl2·6H2O and 0.1 mol of KNO3 in 50 ml of Millipore water were used as the electrolyte. Chronoamperometry was performed at −0.9 V for different time intervals of 3, 5, and 7 minutes. The prepared electrodes were named CS, CS-3, CS-5, and CS-7 for 0, 3, 5, and 7 minutes of Ni(OH)2 electrodeposition on the electrodes. The mass loading of the electrodes was 2.6, 2.8, and 3.0 mg for CS-3, CS-5, and CS-7, respectively. During this process, nitrate ions reacted with water molecules to produce hydroxyl ions, which combined with nickel cations to deposit at the surface of the working electrode as Ni(OH)2. The following electrochemical reactions occurred during the electrodeposition:38 NO3− + 7H2O + 8e− → NH4+ + 10OH−(1) Ni2+ + 2OH− → Ni(OH)2(2)
2.3 Material characterizations
The crystallinity of the electrodes was analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD; PANalytical X’Pert Pro). Surface morphology and elemental composition of the electrodes were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with EDAX analysis on a TESCAN microscope. Crystallinity and composition of the core–shell-like hybrid were revealed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis using an FEI-Tecnai, G2 20 Twin microscope. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to measure the thickness of the electrode materials using an Agilent 5100 (USA) instrument in non-contact mode. Chemical composition of the electrodes was studied by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS; Carl Zeiss instrument, with Al Kα radiation).
2.4 Electrochemical characterizations
The electrochemical behavior of the electrodes was characterized using a three-electrode system consisting of Ag/AgCl, Pt, CuS@Ni(OH)2 as reference, counter and working electrodes respectively; 3 M KOH solution was used as the electrolyte. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed in the potential window of −0.2 to 0.8 V at a scan rate ranging from 5 to 100 mV s−1 using the Autolab instrument. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was undertaken to study the kinetics of the electrodes using the frequency range from 100 kHz to 0.1 Hz with an applied amplitude of 5 mV s−1. Galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD) analysis was performed to study the rate capability (1 to 20 A g−1) as well as cyclic stability of the electrodes up to 4000 cycles at a current density of 20 A g−1. The specific capacitance of the electrodes was calculated by the following equation:1 (3)where Csp is the specific capacitance (F g−1), m is the mass of active materials in the electrode (g), ΔV is the potential window, I is the discharge current (A), and Δt is the discharge time (s).
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Fabrication of CuS@Ni(OH)2

Fig. 1 displays a schematic representation for the preparation of CuS@Ni(OH)2 electrodes. In this first step, CuO-covered Ni-Foam was prepared by a hydrothermal method; this was followed by sulfidation of the CuO. During the sulfidation process, anionic exchange reactions took place and replaced the oxygen in CuO by the sulfide anion in the sodium sulfide solution. The yellow color of the sodium sulfide solution disappeared completely, which ensured the completion of the sulfidation process, which produced CuS. The final step indicates the surface modification of CuS by Ni(OH)2 using the chronoamperometric method (electrodeposition). During this electrodeposition process, nickel hydroxide was uniformly coated onto the surface of the CuS.

3.2 Physical characterization

Fig. 2 shows the XRD patterns of the CS, CS-3, CS-5, CS-7, and Ni(OH)2 electrodes. The obtained XRD results for the CS, CS-3, CS-5, and CS-7 electrodes were well indexed with JCPDS file no: 06-0464 hexagonal covellite structure.10 They demonstrate strong diffraction peaks with 2θ values at 27.3°, 29.01°, 31.65°, and 47.2°; they accord with the corresponding plane values, i.e. (101), (102), (103), and (107). However, the core–shell-like hybrids and Ni(OH)2 have diffraction peaks at 33° and 38.2° with corresponding plane values of (100) and (101) respectively. These correspond to the electrodeposited nickel hydroxide (JCPDS file no: 01-1047).39 The XRD patterns of all the electrodes display three major diffraction peaks with 2θ values at 44°, 52°, and 76°. These correspond to the Ni-Foam substrate, and have a higher intensity than other peaks. In the XRD results, the sharpness of the peaks indicated the strongly crystalline nature of hydrothermally prepared CuS, electrodeposited Ni(OH)2 and core–shell-like hybrids of CuS@Ni(OH)2 without any impurity phases. The presence of two different phases in the core–shell-like hybrids of CuS@Ni(OH)2 was confirmed by the XRD results.

The surface morphology of the CS, Ni(OH)2, CS-3, CS-5, and CS-7 electrodes was examined by SEM, and images are displayed in Fig. 3a–e. The SEM image of pristine CuS shows a nanosheet mat with needle-like CuS anchored morphology (Fig. 3a). The electrodeposited Ni(OH)2 image in Fig. 3b reveals the uniform adherence of Ni(OH)2 on the surface of Ni-Foam. The morphology of electrodeposited Ni(OH)2-modified CuS is depicted in Fig. 3c–e, confirming the presence of Ni(OH)2 on the surface of CuS. The 3 minute Ni(OH)2-electrodeposited CuS (CS-3) electrode in Fig. 3c has smaller grains of Ni(OH)2 on its surface than are seen on CS-5 (Fig. 3d) and CS-7 (Fig. 3e). The CS-5 electrode shows well-electrodeposited Ni(OH)2 on the surface of CuS with small cracks and randomly distributed grains. The CS-7 electrode exhibits a modified surface with a thick layer of electrodeposited Ni(OH)2 that has random cracks and densely presented grains.

Fig. S1a–e (ESI†) displays the energy dispersive analysis X-ray (EDAX) spectra of the electrodes. Fig. S1a (ESI†) shows peaks at 1 and 8 keV for Cu atoms, 0.1 and 2.3 keV for S atoms and 0.9 and 7.5 keV corresponding to the Ni-Foam substrate. The EDAX spectrum of electrodeposited Ni(OH)2 in Fig. S1b (ESI†) contains peaks at 0.9 and 7.5 keV for Ni and 0.5 keV for oxygen. The electrodeposited Ni(OH)2-modified electrodes CS-3, CS-5, and CS-7 also display the same EDAX spectrum, with an additional oxygen peak at 0.5 keV. For these last three modified electrodes, the peak intensity of the nickel atoms is increased, which indicates the increasing content of nickel-based materials in the core–shell-like hybrids.
Moreover, the surface morphology, crystallinity, and the presence of two different phases were confirmed by TEM analysis. TEM images of CuS showed nanosheet-like morphology. The higher magnification image in Fig. 4a (10 nm scale) shows dense, oriented lattice fringes with a strong electron diffraction pattern in agreement with the crystalline nature of the prepared CuS. The d-spacing in Fig. 4a is 0.281 nm, which corresponds to the (103) planes of CuS. Fig. 4b shows the nanosheet-like morphology of electrodeposited Ni(OH)2 with d-spacing of 0.237 nm and plane (101). It strongly acknowledges the presence of Ni(OH)2. In the case of core–shell-like hybrid CS-5, the modified surface morphology (dark clouds-like morphology) is clearly revealed in Fig. 4c. This shows d-spacings of 0.281 nm and 0.237 nm, corresponding to the (103) plane of CuS and (101) plane of Ni(OH)2. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern of the core–shell-like hybrids revealed the crystallinity of the electrode materials. These results proved the presence of two phases in the core–shell-like hybrids.

The average thickness and topography of the electrodes were examined by AFM analysis. The average thickness of the electrode materials loaded on the surface of the Ni-Foam substrate was 270 nm for hydrothermally prepared CS, 250 nm for electrodeposited Ni(OH)2, 280 nm for CS-3, 350 nm for CS-5 and 500 nm for CS-7. Thus the thickness of the electrode material gradually increased from 0 to 7 minutes of Ni(OH)2 electrodeposition on the electrodes. Fig. 5a–e shows the mountain-and-valley surface morphology. The CS-7 electrode (Fig. 5e) shows a well-covered and uniform surface compared with pristine CS. This is clear evidence for the surface modification of the electrodes by Ni(OH)2. In addition, the nanometer-range thickness of the electrode materials also shortened the diffusion path of electrolyte ions and promoted the electrochemical activity of the electrodes.

Furthermore, the actual chemical composition of the electrodes was confirmed by XPS analysis. The wide-scan spectrum of CS-5 contains peaks for the elements copper, sulfur, nickel, and oxygen, as shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†). The high-resolution XPS spectrum of Cu 2p is shown in Fig. 6a; it contains two satellite peaks at 932.3 and 952.2 eV, which correspond to the Cu 2p3/2 and Cu 2p1/2 orbitals. This confirms the presence of copper in the Cu2+ state.31Fig. 6b displays two major peaks at 162.2 and 163.3 eV; these denote the S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2 orbitals corresponding to the S2− state.20 The peak intensity ratio of copper to sulfur is 0.991. These results further reveal the formation of the CuS phase. The Ni 2p spectrum exhibits two characteristic peaks at 856.2 and 873.5 eV. These can be attributed to the Ni 2p3/2 and Ni 2p1/2 orbitals, and the Ni2+ state40 with separation spin energy of 17.3 eV is associated with the Ni(OH)2 phase, which accords with the previous results.40 Also, Fig. 6d shows a strong peak at 531 eV, indicating the oxygen in OH− groups.38 These results confirmed that the core–shell-like hybrids of CS-5 had been successfully fabricated by hydrothermal and electrodeposition methods.

3.3 Electrochemical measurements
A cyclic voltammetry study was performed to measure the current capability and redox nature of the electrodes; results are displayed in Fig. 7a–d. A potential window of −0.2 to 0.7 V and a scan rate ranging from 5 to 100 mV s−1 were used. The current capability of the electrodes increased from CS to CS-5, but the current responsivity of the CS-7 electrode was slightly decreased when compared with CS-5. The cyclic voltammetry graph of Ni(OH)2 has two defined redox peaks corresponding to the faradaic reactions (Fig. S3, ESI†). All the electrodes exhibited a strong redox nature, showing the pseudocapacitance of the electrodes.33 When the scan rate was increased from 5 to 100 mV s−1 the redox peaks were shifted towards the direction with improved current responsivity. Fig. 7e displays the comparison CV curves of the electrodes at a scan rate of 25 mV s−1. The areas under the CV curves of CS-5 and CS-7 are reasonably increased compared with those for CS-3, CS, and Ni(OH)2.

Interestingly, Fig. 7e shows shifted redox peaks. This is ascribed to the improved charge/discharge capability behavior of the surface-modified electrodes. The square root of scan rate versus peak current plots for CS, CS-3, CS-5, CS-7, and Ni(OH)2 are shown in Fig. 7f. The straight line of the plots describes the well-controlled diffusion of the electrolyte ions inside the electrode surface.21 Thus the surface modification led to improved charge storage capacity of the electrodes. The electrochemically active surface area of the electrodes was calculated using the Randles–Sevcik equation:41 ip = 2.69 × 105A × D1/2n2/3Cv1/2(4)where ip = peak current, A = electrochemically active surface area, D = electrolyte diffusion coefficient, n = number of electrons transferred in the redox reaction, C = number of moles per litre of the electrolyte, and v = scan rate of the electrodes. The calculated electrochemically active surface areas of CS, CS-3, CS-5, CS-7, and Ni(OH)2 were 1.85 × 10−3, 1.87 × 10−3, 2.44 × 10−3, 2.39 × 10−3 cm2, and 1.27 × 10−3 cm2 respectively. These results were in good agreement with an improved current capability of the surface-modified electrodes. The following electrochemical reactions were acquired during the analysis:15,42–44 CuS + OH− → CuSOH˙ + e−(5) Ni(OH)2 + OH− → NiOOH + H2O + e−(6)
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis was used to study the kinetics of the electrochemical reactions occurring at the electrode surface. The frequency range of 100 kHz to 0.1 Hz and an applied amplitude of 5 mV s−1 were used. EIS plots were fitted with an equivalent circuit (inset in Fig. 8). In the fitted equivalent circuit, the components Rs, Rct, CPE, Cdl, and Cf represent the internal resistance, charge transfer resistance, constant phase element, double-layer capacitance, and faradaic capacitance, respectively. The absence of a semicircle in the Nyquist plots indicates that improved charge transfer kinetics (lower Rct value) were attained by direct growth of CuS on the surface of Ni-Foam. In the high-frequency region, the slope at the intercept with the X-axis corresponds to the internal resistance of the system. The values of the internal resistance (Rs) of the electrodes were 0.55 Ω for Ni(OH)2, 0.83 Ω for CS, 0.72 Ω for CS-3, 0.64 Ω for CS-5 and 0.53 Ω for CS-7, which indicated that the longer the time used to electrodeposit Ni(OH)2 on the electrodes, the higher the penetration of electrolyte ions inside electrode surface.31 This points to the improved capacitance of the materials. The more vertical line in the low-frequency regions revealed the poor ionic resistance of the electrodes. These EIS results are good evidence for the improved current capability of Ni(OH)2-modified CuS electrodes.

The specific capacitance of the electrodes was measured by charge/discharge analysis in the potential window 0 to 0.4 V at a current density ranging from 1 to 20 A g−1 in 3 M KOH electrolyte solution. Fig. 9a–d shows the rate capability study of CS, CS-3, CS-5, and CS-7 electrodes. The rate capability of Ni(OH)2 is displayed in Fig. S4 (ESI†). The charge/discharge times of the CS-5 electrodes were higher than those of the other electrodes. The non-linear charge/discharge curves indicate the pseudocapacitance of the electrodes. The calculated specific capacitance of the Ni(OH)2, CS, CS-3, CS-5 and CS-7 electrodes at 1 A g−1 were 1164.5, 1895, 2055, 3585 and 2900 F g−1, respectively. The achieved specific capacitance values were compared with previously reported results in the literature, as summarized in Table 1.

On increasing the current density from 1 to 20 A g−1, the specific capacitance values decreased to 480 F g−1 for CS, 550 F g−1 for CS-3, 600 F g−1 for Ni(OH)2, 700 F g−1 for CS-5 and 790 F g−1 for CS-7 electrodes, respectively, and the electrodes showed poor rate capability. This may be due to improper involvement of electrode materials in electrochemical reactions at high current density. The specific capacitance versus current density plot displayed in Fig. 9f also agrees with poor activation of the electrode materials at 20 A g−1. The comparison galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD) curves shown in Fig. 9e, at 2 A g−1 current density, also show that the CS-5 electrode has a much improved charge/discharge time compared with CS and CS-3, as well as a marginally increased charge/discharge time compared with CS-7.
Cycle stability of the electrodes was evaluated for practical applications up to 4000 continuous cycles at a current density of 20 A g−1, as depicted in Fig. 10. The cycle stability of CS, CS-3, CS-5, CS-7, and Ni(OH)2 electrodes was 58.3, 57.3, 56, 59 and 56.6% capacitance retention in the 4000th cycle, with capacitance values of 280, 315, 420, 465 and 340 F g−1, respectively. The capacitance value of the CS-7 in the 4000th cycle was much higher than the values for the other electrode materials. These results strongly proved that a higher amount of Ni(OH)2 loaded onto the electrodes gave better capacitance retention during the cycling process at a high current density of 20 A g−1. Overall, the electrochemical results clearly indicate the following: (1) the presence of highly conductive CuS core on the surface of Ni-Foam substrate reduces the charge transfer resistance, which is helpful for a faster charge/discharge process. (2) The surface modification of CuS by layered nickel hydroxide improves the wettability by electrolyte ions of the surface of the core–shell-like hybrids, and drastically improves the penetration by electrolyte ions.47 The nanosheet morphology of CuS@Ni(OH)2 produces a strong synergistic effect of the core–shell-like hybrids leading to high performances for supercapacitor applications.

4. Conclusions
In brief, we successfully fabricated core–shell-like hybrids of CuS@Ni(OH)2 on Ni-Foam for supercapacitor applications. Crystallinity and composition were confirmed by XRD, SAED, and XPS analysis. The nanometer thickness of the electrode materials was revealed by AFM images. Surface morphology of the electrodes was studied by SEM and TEM imaging. CV results revealed the redox behavior with improved current response. EIS results agree with the improved ionic conductivity of the core–shell-like hybrids. The obtained specific capacitance value of core–shell-like hybrid CS-5 was 3585 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1, with improved capacitance retention at 20 A g−1 (750 F g−1). The cycle stability of the CS-7 electrode was 59%, much higher than that of other electrodes, in the 4000th cycle. These results proved that the hybrids of CuS@Ni(OH)2 meet the demands of supercapacitor applications.
