    , Accepted 10th March 2021First published on 10th March 2021AbstractAtom-economic protocols for the synthesis of poly(indacenodithiophene-alt-benzothiadiazole) (PIDTBT) are presented in which all C–C coupling steps are achieved by direct arylation. Using two different synthetic pathways, PIDTBT copolymers with different side chains (hexylphenyl, octylphenyl, dodecyl, methyl/2-octyldodecylphenyl, 2-octyldodecylphenyl/2-octyldodecylphenyl) and molecular weight (MW) are prepared. Route A makes use of direct arylation polycondensation (DAP) of indacenodithiophene (IDT) and 4,7-dibromo-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (BTBr2) leading to PIDTBT in high yields, with adjustable MW and without indications for structural defects. Route B starts from a polyketone precursor also prepared by DAP following cyclization. While route B allows introduction of asymmetric side chains at the IDT unit, polymer analogous cyclization gives rise to defect formation. The absorption coefficient of PIDTBT with alkylphenyl side chains made by route A increases with MW. Field-effect hole mobilities around ∼10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1 are molecular weight-independent, which is ascribed to a largely amorphous thin film morphology. PIDTBT with linear dodecyl side (C12) chains exhibits a bathochromic shift (20 nm), in agreement with theory, and more pronounced vibronic contributions to absorption spectra. In comparison to alkylphenyl side chains, C12 side chains allow for increased order in thin films, a weak melting endotherm and lower energetic disorder, which altogether explain substantially higher field-effect hole mobilities of ∼ 10−1 cm2 V−1 s−1.
Introduction
Alternating copolymers of indacenodithiophene (IDT) and benzothiadiazole (BT), PIDTBT, have shown intriguing properties as active materials in organic photovoltaics (OPVs) and organic field effect transistors (OFETs).1–5 Due to the preserved coplanar fused aromatic ring system and thus maximized π-orbital overlap of IDT as well as low energetic disorder of PIDTBT, unique electronic properties have been observed.6–8 In OPV devices, PIDTBT:fullerene (PC71BM) blends achieved power conversion efficiencies (PCE) over 6%.9,10 Recently, small molecules based on an IDT-BT core structure were investigated as replacements for fullerene-based acceptors.11–13 Despite their rigid backbone structure and morphologies lacking long range crystalline order,1,14 IDT copolymers are known for their excellent charge transport properties. The combination of IDT and BT units gives rise to a rigid copolymer chain with steep torsion potential, thus favouring charge transport.1,3 Alkyl-substituted P(IDT-alt-BT) copolymers exhibited low conformational disorder and field-effect mobilities up to μsat = 10 cm2 V−1 s−1.3,5,15 It is further noted that IDT-based materials with alkyl side chains are mostly used for transistor applications, while those with alkylphenyl side chains are designed for OPV materials. While the influence of IDT side chains has been investigated for different aliphatic ones,2,16 the influence of alkylphenyl side chains on properties of PIDTBT copolymers is less clear.
Despite their generally appealing properties, IDT copolymers suffer from tedious reaction pathways.17–19 State-of-the-art syntheses involve several steps of traditional transition-metal-catalyzed cross couplings based on Suzuki, Negishi or Stille reactions.10,20 To eliminate usage of undesired toxic or unstable reagents as well as byproducts, and to shorten lengthy reaction pathways simultaneously, direct arylation (DA) as an atom-economical method is highly attractive.21–23 Direct arylation polycondensation (DAP) is meanwhile the method of choice for naphthalene diimide copolymers24–26 and a viable alternative for the preparation of many other donor–acceptor copolymers.27–29 Under optimized conditions, control over molecular weight (MW), a low degree of main chain defects and high yields can be achieved. To date, few reports that report IDT copolymers via DAP and that yield moderate molecular weights have emerged.30–32 Recently, we reported IDT homopolymers via DAP.33
Here, we present a comprehensive study on a series of PIDTBT made by different synthetic pathways, with varying aliphatic and alkylphenyl side chains, and different molecular weight. PIDTBT can be made by direct DAP (route A) as well as by polymer analogous cyclization (route B, Scheme 1). The latter pathway leads to structurally ill-defined products with inferior properties. PIDTBT made by route A with alkylphenyl side chains is molecularly defined, morphology is largely amorphous and field-effect transistor (FET) hole mobilities are independent of molecular weight. In contrast, route A PIDTBT with linear C12 side chains exhibits red-shifted absorption with better defined vibronic structure, increased order in thin films and lower energetic disorder. These findings explain the higher FET hole mobility of PIDTBT with C12 side chains and provide a detailed overview of how side chains influence the properties of PIDTBT.

Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization.
The synthetic routes towards PIDTBT are shown in Scheme 1. All C–C couplings, including monomer synthesis of PhxIDT, were achieved via direct arylation. The optimization of IDT monomer synthesis was investigated previously.33 Monomer K was prepared according to previous reports.17,33,34 Copolymerization of Ph6IDT with 4,7-dibromo-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (BTBr2) via DAP yielded Ph6-PIDTBT copolymers with MWs up to Mn,SEC = 38 kg mol−1. Optimization of MW was carried out considering effects of solvent, temperature, catalyst loading and monomer concentration (Table 1, entries P1–P9). Lowering the reaction temperature led to an increase in MW. Regarding monomer concentration, an optimum was found for 0.1 M.

Monomer concentrations smaller than 0.1 M resulted in lower MWs due to slower build up of chain length and consequently a larger impact of termination reactions (Table 1, P2). Concentrations larger than 0.1 M led to early gelation of the reaction mixture (Table 1, P4). The use of a different solvent such as chlorobenzene to enhance solubility of the formed polymer chains enabled reactions at higher monomer concentrations and lower catalyst loadings, but did not generate higher MW (see ESI,† Table S1, entries S3–5). To increase MW further, Ph8IDT was used in route A. However, despite the better solubility of the monomer higher MWs of the corresponding copolymers were not achieved, eventually due to a lower monomer purity as a result of more difficult purification. To change MW, a reduction of catalyst loading (Table 1, P9) and variation of reaction temperature (Table 1, P1/P3) can be used. For route A, however, adjustment of MW is best achieved by using optimized conditions of entry P1 following slightly changed stoichiometry (Table 1, P6). The synthesis of C12-PIDTBT via DAP proceeded smoothly to give P10 with Mn,SEC = 32 kg mol−1. In comparison to P1 with Ph6 side chains, the reaction mixture containing P10 did not gelate during polymerization. To gain insight into details of the molecular structure of PIDTBT, NMR spectroscopy was used with assignments aided by model compounds. The 1H and 13C NMR spectra of the PIDTBT copolymers did not show obvious evidence for defects (Fig. S1–S4, ESI†). However, it should be noted that defects such as homocouplings35 are generally challenging to detect for IDT copolymers as a result of significant signal broadening and overlap with backbone signals.33 Because of the low intensity of end group signals, a comparison with spectra of appropriate model compounds is an efficient method to assign these signals in NMR spectra of copolymers (Fig. 1).24,25 The Ph6IDT monomer represents the IDT-H end group, and the two IDT-based model compounds 1 (Br-BTIDTBT-Br) and 2 (H-BTIDTBT-H) were synthesized to mimic BT-Br and BT-H end groups, respectively (for details see ESI†). The aromatic region of the 1H NMR spectra of P8 and P6 are depicted in Fig. 1a and d, respectively. Comparison with the monomer Ph6IDT (Fig. 1b and Fig. S5, ESI†) and model 2 (Fig. 1c and Fig. S7, ESI†) revealed IDT-H and BT-H termination for P8. The BT-Br end group (model 1, Fig. 1e and Fig. S6, ESI†) was not detected. However, BT-Br end groups are contained exclusively in the second copolymer (P6), for which a slight excess of BTBr2 was used. A further difference between P8 and P6 is reaction temperature. We assume that the lower temperature used for P6 (80 °C) contributes to the presence of BT-Br end groups by lowering the probability for dehalogenation.

Route B entails the preparation of PIDTBT copolymers via DAP followed by polymer analogous cyclization (Scheme 1, route B).33 Here, MW is generally strongly limited by solubility of the polyketone precursor P(K-alt-TBT). Even long, branched side chains such as R = 2-octyldodecyl only led to moderate MW of Mn,SEC = 11 kg mol−1. The progress of the polymer analogous reactions was monitored by UV-vis and IR spectroscopy (Fig. S10 and S11, ESI†). Additional signals in the NMR spectra (Fig. S12 and S13, ESI†) and very broad and bimodal MW distributions of P11–P13 (Fig. S14, ESI†) suggested significant structural defects of unclear nature. Efforts were made to gain further insight. To eliminate possible side reactions associated with thiophene-based end groups during the post-polymerization sequence, P(K-alt-TBT) was terminated with bromobenzene.33 Phenyl termination of P(K-alt-TBT) reduced the very large dispersity of the corresponding PIDTBT from 3 × 104 to 833 (compare entries P11 and P12 without and with phenyl termination, respectively). Considering that dispersity of P13 with Ph20/Ph20 side chains is ∼5 and thus comparably large, yet lower compared to P11 and P12, we conclude that P11 and P12 with Me/Ph20 side chains likely show a combination of chain-chain coupling and additional aggregation.
These results from NMR spectroscopy and SEC clearly indicated significant defects of unclear nature that are unlikely to be moved entirely. Additionally, UV-vis spectra of PIDTBT made viaroute B were much different (Fig. 2c and d), and FET hole mobilities were much reduced (see Table 3 and further discussion below) compared to route A.
 Fig. 2  UV-vis and PL spectra of PIDTBT of different MW (a and b) and of PIDTBT with different side chains (c and d) in chloroform solution. (P5–P9: R1 = Ph8, P3: R1 = Ph6, P11: Me/Ph20; P13: Ph20/Ph20). 
Obviously, route A is the method of choice to make well-defined PIDTBT via DAP, and PIDTBT made by route B was only further used and mentioned where helpful for a comprehensive discussion. What remains open at this point is the investigation of homocouplings in PIDTBT made by route A, which cannot be ruled out entirely based on the herein performed NMR spectroscopic investigations. Even with the homopolymer PIDT as model compound for IDT CH/CH homocoupling being available, the broad signals did not allow for conclusive statements here. Obtaining direct NMR spectroscopic evidence for homocouplings in PIDTBT is therefore very challenging. However, optical data (vide infra) suggested well-defined PIDTBT from route A to be formed, which is indirect evidence for the absence of such main chain structural defects.
Selected copolymers were further investigated by UV-vis and photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry (CV), density functional theory (DFT) calculations, thermogravimetry (TGA), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), fast scanning calorimetry (FSC), field-effect mobility measurements, grazing incidence X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) and photothermal deflection spectroscopy (PDS). Important results are compiled in Table 2 and further discussed in detail in what follows.

Optical properties
The dependence of MW of PIDTBT with Ph8 side chains made by route A on UV-vis and PL spectra is shown in Fig. 2a and b. With increasing MW a slight bathochromic shift of the absorption maximum and an increase of the molar extinction coefficient εabs,max can be observed. This effect can be attributed to an increasing contribution of the vibronic band at longer wavelength, which in turn may be caused by increasing chain length.36 Notably, the similarity of the spectra in Fig. 2a including a sharp onset at large wavelength is indicative for structurally well-defined copolymers, and thus a robust synthetic DAP protocol. Intensity of PL in solution correlates similarly with MW as found for the molar extinction coefficient. Emission maxima around λem,max = 696 nm are weakly dependent on MW. These almost constant maxima thus result in decreased Stokes shifts for increasing MW (P5: Δλ = 52 nm; P7 = Δλ = 68 nm). Fig. 2c and d illustrates the influence of the synthetic method and IDT side chain pattern on absorption. Small differences between the molar extinction coefficients and intensities of emission maxima of P3 (route A, R = Ph6) and P9 (route A, R = Ph8) likely arise from slightly different molar masses of the repeat unit and MWs. The UV-vis spectra of P11 and P13 made viaroute B are significantly different. The hypsochromically shifted absorption maxima as well as the up to three times smaller molar extinction coefficients suggest disruptions of the π-system due to defects produced during the cyclization step. The emission spectra display the same trends of decreased molar extinction coefficients and hypsochromically shifted spectra thus corroborating this argumentation (Fig. 2d).
The effect of aromatic versus aliphatic side chains on absorption is displayed in Fig. 3. Despite the slightly lower molecular weight of P10 (R = C12H25) compared to P1 (R = Ph6), the absorption spectrum shows a bathochromic shift of 20 nm with the molar extinction coefficient at maximum wavelength being retained (Fig. 3a). Further differences are a smaller contribution of the vibronic shoulder around 600 nm for P10. The film spectrum of P1 shows a small shift of the absorption maximum (Δλ = 8 nm), suggesting little conformational changes of the chain upon solidification. The thin film absorption spectrum of P10 displays a shift of Δλ = 12 nm and additionally develops a pronounced shoulder around 630 nm indicative for increased order (Fig. 3b).
 Fig. 3  Comparison of UV-vis spectra in chloroform solution (a) and film (b) of PIDTBT with aromatic (P1) and aliphatic (P10) side chain pattern via DAP. Films were spin coated (1000 rpm, 60 s) from o-DCB solutions (10 mg mL−1). 
The redshifted absorption spectrum of P10 results in a reduced optical band gap Eg compared to P1 (Eg(P10) = 1.69 eV; Eg(P1) = 1.73 eV). The difference of the optical band gap is reflected in the HOMO/LUMO energy levels of P1 and P10. Determination of the energy levels were carried out by cyclic voltammetry (Fig. S15, ESI†). The electrochemical analyses reveal a slightly higher lying HOMO energy level of P10. In film as well as in solution, the energy of the HOMO levels differ by ΔHOMO(film) = 50 meV and ΔHOMO(solution) = 30 meV, respectively. However, while the nature of the side chains influences the HOMO energy levels of PIDTBT, the LUMO energy level remains largely unaffected (ΔLUMO(film) = 0 meV; ΔLUMO(solution) = −1 meV). The electrochemical properties are summarized in Table S2 (see ESI†).
DFT calculations
To study the reason for the observed shift between the absorption spectra of P1 and P10 (ref. Fig. 3), density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed. First, the structure and energy of the orbitals involved in the optical excitation, which are the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), were analysed. The orbitals were calculated with DFT in Gaussian 1637 for a single repeat unit and the complete side chains. More details to the calculations can be found in the methods section (see ESI†). The resulting orbitals and corresponding Kohn–Sham energies are presented in Fig. 4. The LUMOs are shown in the top of Fig. 4.
 Fig. 4  Frontier orbitals and excitation energies of P10 (left) and P1 (right). The LUMOs (top) primarily localise at the BT units. Energy differences ΔE are based on Kohn–Sham orbital energies. The HOMOs (bottom) delocalise over the full backbone and the side chains (inset). The wavelengths λ of the low-energy excitations of P10 and P1 obtained from TD-DFT differ by about Δλ = 16 nm (centre). 
LUMOs primarily localise at the BT units, while the IDT units receive much less orbital weight and the side chains essentially none. As a result, the different side chains of P1 and P10 have a minor impact on the orbital energy of the LUMO and the Kohn–Sham energies differ by only . In contrast, the HOMOs delocalise over the full backbone (bottom of Fig. 4) and expand over the alkyl chain of P10 and phenyl group of P1, as shown in the insets of Fig. 4. Therefore, the side chains do affect the HOMO energies and the resulting Kohn–Sham energies differ by . As a result, the HOMO of P10 is shifted to higher energies, while the LUMO is nearly unaffected. This decreases the single-particle gap and causes a redshift in the excitation energy. To analyse this in more detail, the first excitation energy of each structure is calculated with time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) for an enlarged polymer backbone in solution for which we use a polymer model of three repeat units. To make the calculations computational feasible, the side chains are cut-off after the first alkyl segment, since the frontier orbitals do not significantly delocalise beyond these as shown in Fig. 4. The chloroform solution used in the experiment is modelled by the polarizable continuum model as implemented in Gaussian 16.37 More details on the simulation parameters can be found in the methods section (see ESI†). The TD-DFT simulations yield excitation energies of λP10 = 2.329 eV (532 nm) and λP1 = 2.376 eV (522 nm). However, the excitation energies calculated with TD-DFT usually show a systematic overestimation in the range of ΔλTD-DFT = 300–600 meV.38,39 Here, we apply a shift of Δλsim-exp = 448 meV that yields corrected excitation energies of λP10 = 1.882 eV (659 nm) and λP1 = 1.928 eV (643 nm), which are shown in the centre of Fig. 4. More important than the absolute position of the excitation energy, the TD-DFT simulations reveal a redshift of the excitation energy of P10 by Δλsim = 16 nm similar to the experimental observation of Δλexp = 20 nm. We therefore find that the deeper and slightly more delocalized HOMO on the alkylphenyl side chains causes the observed shift. Conformation and coplanarity of the IDT is not affected by the different side chains.
Thermal properties
All polymers possess good thermal stability with degradation temperatures (5% weight loss) Td between 370–450 °C (Table 2 and Fig. S16, ESI†). DSC second heating thermograms reveal a shallow exotherm around 90 °C (Fig. S17, ESI†), which we explain with reorganization at temperatures exceeding the glass transition temperature Tg. We note that all investigated copolymers show similar DSC traces and appear to undergo such a process in a similar temperature range, as expected for polymers with an Mn > 10 kg mol−1 for which the Tg becomes less dependent on chain length.40 Only for P10 with C12 side chains, a Tg of 96 °C can be determined (Fig. S17 and S18, ESI†).41P10 also shows two weak transitions that are ascribed to melting (Tm = 213 °C, ΔHm = 1.5 J g−1) and crystallization (Tc = 168 °C, ΔHc = 3.7 J g−1). The weak crystallinity of P10 is in accordance to the observations of vibronic structure seen in thin film UV-vis spectra and indicates improved intermolecular packing enabled by the more flexible aliphatic side chains compared to Ph6-substituted PIDTBT, for which conventional DSC thermograms did not show signs of crystallization.
Due to the difficulty for all polymers to extract Tg values from conventional DSC, we additionally carried out physical ageing experiments to investigate Tg values in more detail. We chose to focus on P13 because we expected this material to display a high degree of disorder, and hence a prominent Tg, due to the presence of main chain defects (cf. discussion above). The same type of experiment was inconclusive for samples made viaroute A (not shown). We used fast scanning calorimetry (FSC) to anneal P13 for 30 min at Tanneal ranging from 30 to 140 °C, followed by rapid heating at 4000 K s−1 from −50 to 300 °C (Fig. 5a), which follows a protocol that has been used for other conjugated polymers.42,43 A distinct endothermic overshoot can be discerned for each Tanneal with a clear minimum in enthalpy ΔH at Tanneal = 80 °C (Fig. 5b). We identify two temperature regimes below and above 80 °C, which we assign to enthalpy relaxation of the mobile amorphous fraction (MAF) and rigid amorphous fraction (RAF), respectively. We extrapolate an upper limit of the Tg of 88 °C, which is in agreement with the exotherms observed with conventional DSC (Fig. S17, ESI†). The same type of experiment was performed on C12-PIDTBT P10 to investigate the influence of the side chains on the relaxation kinetics of the polymer backbone and hence the Tg of the polymer.40 FSC measurements reveal a slightly higher Tg of 98 °C (Fig. 5c). The rather small difference in Tg between P10 and P13 is remarkable considering the very different nature of side chains in the two polymers. The larger side chains of P13 (52 carbons) compared to P10 (24 carbons) are expected to decrease Tg of the former,44 but this effect may be partially compensated by the phenyl rings that are part of the side chains of Ph20, which cause an increase at a constant number of carbons.40,45

Electrical properties
The charge transport properties of the polymers thin films were investigated with field-effect transistors, using a standard top-gate bottom-contact configuration characterized by a channel length of 20 μm (Fig. S19–S22, ESI†). The extracted values for the apparent charge mobility in the saturation regime (Vd = Vg = −60 V) are summarized in Table 3.

The hole mobilities of the polymers viaroute A are in the range of μsat = 0.02–0.04 cm2 V−1 s−1, in line with values reported for polymer analogues made by Stille coupling.9,10 Reducing the channel length to 5 μm leads to a slight improvement of mobility in a similar manner for all investigated copolymers, up to μsat = 0.05 cm2 V−1 s−1. We tentatively attribute the channel length dependence to lateral-field enhancement of charge transport and/or injection.46 In general, the measured values of PIDTBT with alkylphenyl side chains are one order of magnitude lower than C12-substituted PIDTBT P10 (Fig. S21, ESI†). This effect may be caused by the steric hindrance of the rigid phenyl rings that reduce intermolecular stacking of backbones and thus a contribution from interchain transport.
Unlike alkyl-substituted PIDTBT where longer alkyl chains as well as higher MW lead to improved μsat by up to one order of magnitude (R = octyl, μsat = 0.15 cm2 V−1 s−1; R = hexyldecyl, μsat = 1.2 cm2 V−1 s−1)2, alkylphenyl-substituted PIDTBT neither exhibits a MW nor a side chain length dependence (Fig. S19 and S20, ESI†). PIDTBT P11-P13 made by route B exhibits decreased transport performance with mobilities smaller by two to three orders of magnitude that obviously result from defective backbones (Fig. S22, ESI†).
To gain further insight into the differences in device performance, photothermal deflection spectroscopy (PDS) was carried out (Fig. S23, ESI†). The Urbach energy UE which can be extracted from the PDS measurements is related to energetic disorder in the material. P10 with the highest mobility exhibits a lower Urbach energy and slightly less sub-band gap states than the alkylphenyl-substituted P1 (UE(P10) = 36 meV; UE(P1) = 49 meV). This trend indicates larger energetic disorder of P1 which is in agreement with its lower mobility.
GIWAXS measurements
The impact of the side chain architecture on morphology was analysed by grazing incidence wide angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurements. The films were prepared using the same conditions as for OFETs. The results are represented in Fig. 6. The alkylphenyl-substituted PIDTBT P1 film shows broader peaks compared to the alkyl-substituted P10 indicating a less ordered stacking and is in agreement with the previous observations from optical, thermal and charge transport characterization. The GIWAXS pattern of P10 is consistent with previous measurements of alkyl-substituted PIDTBT,1,3 with a prominent (010) (π-stacking) peak located in the out-of-plane direction QZ = 1.57 Å−1 corresponding to a π–π stacking of 4.0 Å. There are also a series of sharp in-plane reflections observed for P10 which are indexed to backbone reflections with the (001) peak appearing at QXY = 0.395 Å−1 corresponding to a d-spacing of 15.9 Å. There is also a diffuse peak at QZ ∼ 0.3 Å−1 in the out-of-plane direction. The indexing of this peak is uncertain; it is reminiscent of a lamellar stacking peak, but its appearance along QZ is inconsistent with the otherwise face-on texture of P10. This peak could be associated with a disordered, edge-on population3 or reflect a more complicated unit cell. In contrast to P10, P1 shows an absence of backbone reflections, with a broader (010) peak. The broad ring at Q = 1.4 Å−1 – which is reflective of amorphous chains – is also more prominent in P1 compared to P10. Overall, the scattering data indicating increased order for P10 with aliphatic side chains is in full accordance with DSC, UV-vis spectroscopy and PDS, and provides an explanation for the observed charge transport behaviour in this series of polymers.

Conclusions
We have presented two synthetic pathways towards PIDTBT copolymers using direct arylation for all C–C coupling steps. Route A relies on a classical DAP approach in which preformed monomers undergo polycondensation to give well-defined PIDTBT. Route B proceeds via a polyketone precursor also made via DAP following polymer analogous cyclization. The comprehensive investigation of PIDTBT prepared by these different routes, with different molecular weights as well as different side chains revealed that (i) route A is superior compared to route B in terms of structural defects, (ii) optical properties of PIDTBT made viaroute A are strongly influenced by molecular weight, (iii) PIDTBT with alkylphenyl side chains exhibits MW-independent field-effect hole mobilities in the range of 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1 due to a mostly amorphous structure and (iv) PIDTBT with aliphatic C12 side chains and made viaroute A shows increased order, lower energetic disorder and accordingly higher field-effect hole mobilities on the order of 10−1 cm2 V−1 s−1. Thus, the presence or absence of phenyl rings in the side chains of PIDTBT has drastic consequences for packing, which is relevant for both transistor performance3,16,47 as well as stability of blends with IDT-based components used for non-fullerene solar cells.48
Regarding a more comprehensive analysis of defects in PIDTBT made viaroute B, and neither proven nor unproven homocouplings in PIDTBT made viaroute A, further model compounds as well as significantly extended spectroscopic investigations will be required to make finale statements. A full homocoupling analysis of PIDTBT is generally much more challenging compared to other copolymers due to broad signals in 1H NMR spectra. Unless irregularities between different samples show up, such study does not appear rewarding, and there is also no reason to assume their presence at this point.

 	Fig. 3  Comparison of UV-vis spectra in chloroform solution (a) and film (b) of PIDTBT with aromatic (P1) and aliphatic (P10) side chain pattern via DAP. Films were spin coated (1000 rpm, 60 s) from o-DCB solutions (10 mg mL−1).	 

 	Fig. 4  Frontier orbitals and excitation energies of P10 (left) and P1 (right). The LUMOs (top) primarily localise at the BT units. Energy differences ΔE are based on Kohn–Sham orbital energies. The HOMOs (bottom) delocalise over the full backbone and the side chains (inset). The wavelengths λ of the low-energy excitations of P10 and P1 obtained from TD-DFT differ by about Δλ = 16 nm (centre).	 

 	Fig. 5  (a) Protocol used for FSC measurements comprising a heating scan after physical ageing for 30 min at annealing temperature Tanneal (blue) and a second reference heating scan from -50 to 300 °C (red); FSC heating thermograms of (b) P13 and (c) P10, after ageing (blue) and corresponding reference scans (red) as well as the enthalpy of the endothermic overshoot ΔH as a function of Tanneal; the dashed line represents the extrapolation of the upper limit of the Tg.
