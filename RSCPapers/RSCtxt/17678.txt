    , Accepted 19th February 2019First published on 20th February 2019AbstractIn quantum-dot light-emitting diodes (QLEDs), exciton quenching at the interface of the quantum-dot emissive layer and the electron-transporting layer is one of the main non-radiative decay channels. One effective approach to suppress this interfacial exciton quenching is by using insulating interlayers. However, the use of insulating interlayers causes a dilemma because thicker interlayers, which are preferred for suppressing exciton quenching, can result in inefficient electron injection. Here, we demonstrate that the use of zirconium acetylacetonate (Zr(acac)4), a low work function and transparent metal chelate, as interlayers simultaneously suppresses interfacial exciton quenching and offers good electron-transporting properties. By employing an inverted QLED as a model system, we show that devices with Zr(acac)4 interlayers are superior to devices with insulating interlayers in a number of aspects, including higher optimal quantum efficiency, power efficiency, and longer operational lifetimes. Furthermore, the device performance is less sensitive to the thicknesses of the interlayers. Our study sheds light on the rational design of interlayers for high-performance QLEDs.
Introduction
Quantum-dot light-emitting diodes (QLEDs) combine the superior emissive properties of colloidal quantum dots and the advantages of solution-based processing techniques, promising a new generation of low-cost, large-area and high-performance electroluminescent devices.1–8 State-of-the-art QLEDs adopt a hybrid structure utilizing oxide electron-transporting layers (ETLs) and organic hole-transporting layers.4,9–13 In hybrid-structured QLEDs, exciton quenching at the QD/ETL interface can be one of the main non-radiative decay channels, limiting the efficiency of the devices.14,15
One effective approach to suppress interfacial exciton quenching is by inserting an insulating interlayer between the oxide ETL and the QD emissive layer.4,16–18 For this purpose, a few materials, including poly(methylmethacrylate) (PMMA),4,18 polyethylenimine ethoxylated (PEIE)19,20 or polyethylenimine (PEI),21 Cs2CO316 and Al2O3,17 have been introduced into QLEDs. These insulating interlayers help to preserve the emissive properties of QDs by increasing the distances between the QDs and the oxide ETLs. Naturally, thicker interlayers lead to more effective suppression of interfacial exciton quenching. At the same time, the use of insulating interlayers inevitably modifies the process of electron injection into the QDs, which in turn affects charge balance in the QD emissive layer. The thicker the interlayers are, the less efficient the electron tunneling processes through the insulating layers are. In consequence, the device performance can be very sensitive to the thicknesses of the interlayers.4,17,21 Optimal device efficiency is often a compromised result of suppressing exciton quenching and allowing efficient electron injection.
Solving this dilemma requires new interlayers which can simultaneously suppress interfacial exciton quenching and offer good electron-transporting properties. Previous studies on organic solar cells have demonstrated that metal chelates, such as zirconium acetylacetonate (Zr(acac)4) and hafnium acetylacetonate, can function as efficient cathode buffer layers to improve device efficiency because of their high transparency in the visible region, low work function and good electron-transporting properties.22–29 Here we explore the feasibility of using metal chelates as interlayers in QLEDs by using devices with an inverted structure as a model system. Furthermore, QLEDs with Zr(acac)4 interlayers are compared with QLEDs with PEIE interlayers to find out how the properties of interlayers impact device performance.
Results and discussion
The chemical composition, and morphological, electrical and optical properties of Zr(acac)4 films (∼10 nm in thickness) deposited onto films of Zn0.9Mg0.1O nanocrystals, which serve as ETLs in inverted QLEDs, are investigated. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses on the Zr(acac)4 film and Zr(acac)4 powders show identical characteristic peaks of Zr, C, and O (Fig. S1, ESI†). Fourier transform infrared spectra of the Zr(acac)4 film and Zr(acac)4 powders are nearly identical to each other (Fig. S2, ESI†). These results indicate that the formation processes do not cause any chemical changes in Zr(acac)4. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements (Fig. 1a) show a root-mean-square roughness of 1.3 nm, indicating smooth surface features. Scanning Kelvin probe microscopy analyses (Fig. 1b) show evenly distributed surface potentials with small variations of <40 meV. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) shown in Fig. 1c illustrate that depositing a Zr(acac)4 layer onto a Zn0.9Mg0.1O film lowers the work function, i.e., from 3.6 to 3.4 eV. Optical transmission spectra (Fig. 1d) indicate that both ITO/Zn0.9Mg0.1O and ITO/Zn0.9Mg0.1O/Zr(acac)4 samples exhibit high transmittances of over 84% (average) from 400 to 800 nm, suggesting an excellent optical transparency of the Zr(acac)4 films.

The unique properties of Zr(acac)4 films encourage us to introduce them as interlayers between the QD emissive layers and Zn0.9Mg0.1O ETLs in QLEDs. We fabricated red QLEDs with an inverted structure of PEIE modified ITO/Zn0.9Mg0.1O nanocrystals (60 nm)/Zr(acac)4 (∼10 nm)/QDs (20 nm)/N,N′-bis (naphthalen-1-yl)-N,N′-bis(phenyl)-9,9-spiro-bifluorene (Spiro-NPB, 65 nm)/dipyrazino[2,3-f:2′,3′-h]quinoxaline-2,3,6,7,10,11-hexacarbonitrile (HATCN, 15 nm)/Al (100 nm) (Fig. 2a). A schematic of the flat-band energy level diagram of the multi-layers is shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†). In this structure, PEIE modified ITO exhibiting a low work function of ∼4.3 eV is used as a cathode, which provides effective electron injection into the Zn0.9Mg0.1O ETLs. Red CdSe–CdZnS core–shell QDs (Fig. S4, ESI†) with a high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of ∼90% in solution are used to deposit the emissive layer. Bilayers of Spiro-NPB and HATCN are known as effective hole-transporting layers (HTLs) for red QLEDs with inverted structures.9 Control devices without the Zr(acac)4 interlayers were also fabricated.

Inset in (b): electroluminescence spectrum at 2.5 V. (d) Histograms of the maximum PCEs and EQEs of 48 QLEDs with the Zr(acac)4 interlayers. 
A typical electroluminescence spectrum (Fig. 2b, inset) indicates a symmetric emission peak at 624 nm with a full width at half-maximum of 26 nm. The current density–luminance–voltage (J–L–V) characteristics of the QLEDs are shown in Fig. 2b. For the QLEDs with the Zr(acac)4 interlayer, the current density and luminance increase steeply once a turn-on voltage (defined as the driving voltage at 1 cd m−2) of 1.8 V is reached. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) reaches a maximum of 13.4% (Fig. 2c) at a driving voltage of 2.3 V. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of this device reaches 11.1% at a brightness of ∼142 cd m−2 and is maintained above 10% at a brightness of 1000 cd m−2. A histogram of 48 devices from three batches indicates an average peak EQE of 12.3% with a relative standard deviation of 2.3% and an average maximum PCE of 10.2% with a relative standard deviation of 2.5% (Fig. 2d). In contrast, the devices without the Zr(acac)4 interlayer show substantially deteriorated performance (Fig. 2b and c). The turn-on voltage of the Zr(acac)4-free device is increased to 2.4 V. At a driving voltage of 3 V, the current density for the Zr(acac)4-free device is ∼0.2 mA cm−2, which is nearly two orders of magnitude lower than that of the device with the Zr(acac)4 interlayer. The peak EQE and maximum PCE of the Zr(acac)4-free device are 7.1% and 4.5%, respectively (Fig. 2c), which are significantly lower than those of the devices with the Zr(acac)4 interlayers.
In our QLEDs with an inverted structure, the Zr(acac)4 interlayer plays dual roles, i.e., minimizing exciton quenching at the QD/ETL interface and enhancing electron injection into the QD layer. Regarding the issue of interfacial exciton quenching, four samples (quartz/QDs, quartz/Zn0.9Mg0.1O/QDs, quartz/Zr(acac)4/QDs and quartz/Zn0.9Mg0.1O/Zr(acac)4/QDs) were prepared and characterized. To focus on the interface induced effects, the thicknesses of the QD layers are controlled to be approximately one monolayer. Fig. 3a shows that the average PL lifetimes of QDs on the quartz, quartz/Zn0.9Mg0.1O, quartz/Zr(acac)4 and quartz/Zn0.9Mg0.1O/Zr(acac)4 substrates are 24.5, 20.2, 24.2 and 23.6 ns, respectively. Fig. 3b shows that the PLQYs of the samples of quartz/QDs, quartz/Zn0.9Mg0.1O/QDs, quartz/Zr(acac)4/QDs and quartz/Zn0.9Mg0.1O/Zr(acac)4/QDs are ∼81%, ∼62%, ∼80% and ∼76%, respectively. These results suggest that Zr(acac)4 does not quench the excitons of the QDs and the insertion of the Zr(acac)4 layer between the Zn0.9Mg0.1O ETL and QD layer suppresses interfacial exciton quenching. Regarding the issue of electron injection into the QD layer, we fabricated two electron-only devices with structures of ITO/Al (100 nm)/Zn0.9Mg0.1O (60 nm)/QDs (20 nm)/Al (100 nm) and ITO/Al (100 nm)/Zn0.9Mg0.1O (60 nm)/Zr(acac)4 (10 nm)/QDs (20 nm)/Al (100 nm) and analyzed their electrical characteristics. Fig. 3c shows that inserting the Zr(acac)4 layer increases the current densities by about two orders of magnitude. This result is line with the UPS (Fig. 1c) showing that the introduction of the Zr(acac)4 interlayer decreases the work function of the ETLs, which facilitates electron injection from the ETLs to QD layers. These results explain that the introduction of the Zr(acac)4 interlayer leads to QLEDs with lower turn-on voltages, larger current densities and higher EQEs and PCEs.

Next, we compare Zr(acac)4 with PEIE, another material which has been applied as interlayers in QLEDs,19,20 to find out how the properties of interlayers influence device operation. Systematic thickness-dependent investigations were conducted for both Zr(acac)4 and PEIE. The thicknesses of the Zr(acac)4 films and the PEIE films were controlled by tuning the concentrations of solutions and were monitored using a Stylus Profiler and an AFM (Fig. S5, ESI†). First, we carried out PLQY and transient PL characterization studies on a series of samples of PEIE or Zr(acac)4 with different thicknesses inserted between monolayers of QDs and Zn0.9Mg0.1O films. The results (Fig. 4a and b) suggest that Zr(acac)4 and PEIE show almost identical behaviors in terms of suppressing exciton quenching. For both Zr(acac)4 and PEIE, the PLQYs of the QD films increase monotonically from 62% to 77% when the average thicknesses of the interlayers increase from 0 nm to 10 nm. Further increasing the thickness of the interlayer results in a minimal increase of the PLQY to ∼80%. Correspondingly, the trends of the average lifetimes of the QD films (Fig. 4b) match those of the PLQYs of the QD films. Thicker interlayers effectively block charge transfer processes occurring between QDs and Zn0.9Mg0.1O films, thus preserving their superior emissive properties.4,9 Second, we fabricated two sets of electron-only devices with a structure of ITO/Al/Zn0.9Mg0.1O (60 nm)/interlayer/QDs (20 nm)/Al in which Zr(acac)4 or PEIE interlayers with different thicknesses are incorporated.
 Fig. 4  Comparison of Zr(acac)4 and PEIE as interlayers for QLEDs. (a) PLQYs and (b) average lifetimes of monolayers of CdSe–CdZnS core–shell QDs deposited on top of ITO/ZnMg0.9O0.1 modified with interlayers with different thicknesses; (c) current density (at 1 V) versus interlayer thickness characteristics for the electron-only devices with Zr(acac)4 or PEIE interlayers (the data are extracted from Fig. S6 (ESI†)); and (d) turn-on voltage, (e) peak EQE and (f) maximum PCE versus interlayer thickness characteristics for QLEDs incorporating Zr(acac)4 or PEIE as interlayers, respectively (data are extracted from Fig. S7 and S8 (ESI†)). 
The corresponding J–V curves are shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†). The current densities of the devices at 1 V are plotted in Fig. 4c. PEIE can form interfacial dipoles with oxide films, which lowers the work function and enhances electron injection.30,31 As a result, inserting an ultrathin layer of PEIE (∼1 nm) significantly increase the current densities of the electron-only devices by more than two orders of magnitude. This behavior is akin to that of inserting an ultrathin layer of Zr(acac)4. Due to the insulating nature of PEIE, increasing the thicknesses of PEIE interlayers causes a rapid decrease of the current densities (Fig. 4c). When the thickness of PEIE reaches 15 nm, the current densities of the electron-only devices are smaller than those of the interlayer-free devices. The dependence of the current densities of the electron-only devices on the thicknesses of the Zr(acac)4 interlayers shows a much slower decrease compared with that of the devices with PEIE interlayers. The current density of a device with a Zr(acac)4 interlayer is two orders of magnitude larger than that of a device with a PEIE interlayer when the thicknesses of both interlayers reach 20 nm.
The above analyses lead us to conclude that Zr(acac)4 is more advantageous than PEIE as interlayers. The two interlayers show identical behaviors of suppressing interfacial exciton quenching. However, for PEIE, layers thicker than 10 nm, which are preferred for suppressing interfacial exciton quenching, would significantly hinder charge injection into the QD layers. The poor electron injection with a thick PEIE interlayer may deteriorate charge balance in QLEDs, resulting in poor device performance.15 For Zr(acac)4, this dilemma is solved because Zr(acac)4 exhibits substantially better electron-transporting properties than PEIE.
To confirm this point, we fabricate two sets of QLEDs with controlled thicknesses of Zr(acac)4 or PEIE as interlayers. The corresponding device performances are shown in Fig. S7 and S8 (ESI†). The turn-on voltages of the two sets of QLEDs are extracted and plotted in Fig. 4d. When inserting 1 nm of the interlayer for either Zr(acac)4 or PEIE, the turn-on voltages were reduced compared with the interlayer-free device. Remarkably, different trends arise upon further increasing the interlayer thicknesses. For the PEIE interlayer, the turn-on voltages of the QLEDs increased from 2 V to 3.2 V when the thicknesses of PEIE were increased from 1 nm to 20 nm. In contrast, the turn-on voltages of the QLEDs with Zr(acac)4 interlayers are maintained at ∼1.8 V over a wide range of interlayer thicknesses (5–20 nm). In terms of device efficiency, the QLEDs with Zr(acac)4 interlayers show optimal results when the thickness of the Zr(acac)4 interlayer is 10 nm. A peak EQE of 13.4% and a maximum PCE of 11.1% are achieved, which are 1.3 times and 1.4 times higher than those of the optimized QLEDs with PEIE interlayers (Fig. 4e and f). Notably, the performance of QLEDs with Zr(acac)4 interlayers is less sensitive to the thickness of the interlayer. Increasing the thickness of the Zr(acac)4 layer to 20 nm leads to a slight decrease of the maximum PCE to 9.65%. In contrast, the QLED with a 20 nm PEIE interlayer shows a poor maximum PCE of 3.93%. Notably, both the devices with Zr(acac)4 as interlayers and the devices with PEIE interlayers can withstand thermal annealing of up to 80 °C without reducing device efficiency (Fig. S9 (ESI†)), demonstrating good thermal stability.
Regarding the stability of QLEDs, the half-lifetime T50 (the time when the luminance decreases to 50% L0) of the optimized devices with a 10 nm Zr(acac)4 interlayer reaches 65 hours at an initial brightness of 10800 cd m−2 (Fig. 5). For QLEDs with a 10 nm PEIE interlayer or without an interlayer, the T50 values at initial brightnesses of 10200 and 10100 cd m−2 are 13 hours and 5 hours, respectively. The lifetimes of the QLEDs with the Zr(acac)4 interlayer are nearly 5 times longer than those of the QLEDs with the PEIE interlayer. These results ambiguously demonstrate that for QLEDs conductive and quenching-free interlayers are more advantageous than insulating interlayers.

Conclusions
Our work demonstrates that Zr(acac)4, a low work function and transparent metal chelate, simultaneously suppresses interfacial exciton quenching and offers good electron-transporting properties in QLEDs. We highlight that for interlayer applications Zr(acac)4 is superior to PEIE, an insulating interlayer, because devices with Zr(acac)4 interlayers demonstrate the advantages of higher optimal quantum efficiency, power efficiency and longer operational lifetimes. Furthermore, the device performance is less sensitive to the thicknesses of the interlayers. Our study renders a new type of interlayer material ideal for QLEDs.
