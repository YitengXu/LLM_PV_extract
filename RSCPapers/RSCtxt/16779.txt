Our analysis employed the tetragonal structures (P4mm) of (CH3NH3)PbI3 and (CH3NH3)SnI3, the trigonal (P3m1) structure of (NH2CHNH2)PbI3, and the orthorhombic (Amm2) structure of (NH2CHNH2)SnI3 to examine their thermoelectric properties around room temperature. Our work reveals that the ZTs of electron-doped ABI3 perovskites can be as large as that of hole-doped Bi2Te3 whereas those of hole-doped ABI3 are rather smaller so that, in thermoelectric performance, electron-doped perovskites ABI3 can be as good as hole-doped Bi2Te3.
1. Introduction
In organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite iodides ABI3 (A = CH3NH3, NH2CHNH2; B = Sn, Pb), BI6 octahedra containing divalent cations B2+ form a three-dimensional (3D) perovskite lattice of BI3. The monovalent cations A+ such as methyl ammonium (MA), CH3NH3+, or formamidinium (FA), NH2CHNH2+, occupy the center of each B8 cube made up of eight corner-sharing BI6 octahedra (Fig. 1). These perovskites have been examined as light harvesting materials,1,2 solar-cell absorbers,3–6 and the tunability of their ferroelectric properties.7 They were also considered as new n-type thermoelectric materials8–10 and as solar thermoelectric generators, an alternative to thermoelectric devices.11–13 The efficiency of thermoelectric energy conversion is measured by the figure of merit, ZT = (S2σ/κ)T, where S, σ, κ, and T refer to the Seebeck coefficient, electrical conductivity, thermal conductivity, and temperature, respectively.14 Efficient thermoelectric materials need to possess a relatively large value of the power factor, S2σ, and a low thermal conductivity κ = κe + κL, where κe is the electron thermal conductivity arising from charge carriers, and κL is the lattice thermal conductivity. In general, κe increases with increasing σ, so that κL is expected to be more important in controlling the ZT. Electronic structure calculations for ABI3 perovskites show that, as expected, they all have a band gap.8,15–17 However, as-grown samples of (MA)SnI3 were reported to exhibit metallic properties due to a trace amount of spontaneous hole-doping in the crystallization process.15 A systematic investigation revealed that samples of ABI3 perovskites behave as p- or n-type semiconductors depending on the preparation method, and n-type samples have a low carrier concentration.9 The lattice thermal conductivity of (MA)PbI3 was found to be very low.18

MA = methyl ammonium (CH3NH3+), and FA = formamidinium (HC(NH2)2+).

The C–N axis of MA and the N⋯N axis of FA cations are oriented along the c-axis, but are shown schematically to show their chemical structures. 
Very recently, He and Galli10b evaluated the thermoelectric properties of (MA)BI3 (B = Pb, Sn) using the Kane single band model19 on the basis of DFT calculations. Their results show that the maximum ZT values of these compounds can be obtained from electron doping rather than from hole doping. In their evaluation of the thermal transport coefficients, they calculated the electrical mobility μ by considering only the acoustic phonon scattering (electron–phonon interaction). There are several factors governing the electrical mobility. According to Matthiessen's rule, the actual mobility μe is written as 
(1)
To know the actual mobility μe, we need to consider various contributions such as acoustic phonons, optical phonons, impurities and surface scattering. In typical semiconducting materials, it is known that ionized impurities and acoustic phonons are important scattering sources. Especially in heavily doped semiconductor, there would be more ionized impurities so their scattering would be more important. In addition, when there are more than 1017 electrons per cm3, electron–electron scattering starts to become significant. He and Galli considered only the acoustic phonon scattering in the doping range 1 × 1016 to 5 × 1019 cm−3 so their estimate of the mobility might be much larger than the actual mobility of the material, leading an overestimated relaxation time τ (see eqn (2)). 
μe = eτ/m*
(2)where e, and m* are the electric charge and effective mass, respectively.
In the present work we assess the feasibility of the perovskite iodides the ABI3 for thermoelectric applications by evaluating the power factor (PF), S2σ, and the figure of merit, ZT = (S2σ/κ)T, as a function of the chemical potential (equivalently, as a function of charge carrier density) on the basis of density functional theory (DFT) calculations. For this purpose, it is necessary to calculate the thermoelectric properties of these perovskites using their crystal structures around room temperature, and compare them with those of the well-known thermoelectric material Bi2Te3 that is optimized for temperatures around 300 K.20,21 The structures of the perovskites ABI3 depend on temperature, because the organic cations A+ rattle around within their B8 cages interacting with the BI3 framework.15,22–24 Thus, we examine the tetragonal structures (P4mm) of (MA)PbI3 and (MA)SnI3, the trigonal (P3m1) structure of (FA)PbI3, and the orthorhombic (Amm2) structure of (FA)SnI3 (Table 1).8 Experimentally, the precise atomic positions of these perovskite iodides are poorly determined (particularly, those of the organic cations) so that we first optimize the atomic positions of these crystal structures by DFT calculations and then use the optimized structures to calculate their thermoelectric properties. Our work suggests that, in their thermoelectric efficiency, the iodide perovskites ABI3 can be nearly as good as that of Bi2Te3 if enough electrons can be doped. Under hole doping, they are not expected to be as efficient as Bi2Te3.

2. Theoretical aspects and computational details
For a semiconductor, the band gap Eg is given by Eg = ECBM − EVBM, where ECBM and EVBM refer to the energies of the conduction band minimum (CBM) and valence band maximum (VBM), respectively. The chemical potential μ for holes (μ < 0) is defined as μ = E − EVBM where E < EVBM, and that for electrons (μ > 0) by μ = E − ECBM where E > ECBM. The charge carriers available for a hole-doped or an electron-doped semiconductor at a given chemical potential μ can be approximated by integrating the electronic density of states (DOS) N(μ).
Our DFT electronic structure calculations employed the frozen-core projector augmented wave (PAW) method25 encoded in the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP)26 using the generalized-gradient approximation (GGA)27 of Perdew, Burke and Ernzerhof for the exchange-correlation functional with the plane-wave-cut-off energy of 550 eV, the Monkhorst–Pack k-points mesh of 10 × 10 × 10, and the threshold of self-consistent-field energy convergence of 10−6 eV. In general, it is not easy to measure exact positions of small atoms such as hydrogen atoms by XRD measurements. For this reason, the hydrogen atom positions of organic molecules are not specified in most cases. Thus, we add H atoms to the FA and MA molecules and then optimize the atom positions of ABI3 while keeping constant the cell parameters ABI3 on the basis of density functional calculations. The atomic positions of (MA)PbI3, (MA)SnI3, (FA)PbI3, and (FA)SnI3 were fully optimized until all the residual forces are smaller than 0.005 eV Å−1 with their cell parameters fixed (Table 1). The atom positions obtained from these optimizations are summarized in Tables S1–S4 of the ESI.† Heavy elements such as Pb, Sn and I possess a strong spin orbit coupling (SOC) effect. We examine the SOC effect on our calculations by comparing the band gaps of the perovskite iodides obtained from GGA and GGA + SOC calculations. As listed in Table 2, the band gaps determined from the GGA calculations agree better with the experimental band gaps than do those from the GGA + SOC calculations, as has already been reported for (MA)PbI3.16 In estimating thermoelectric properties, it is important to describe a band gap correctly so that our discussion of the perovskite iodides will be based on GGA calculations.

The thermoelectric properties of all considered ABI3 systems were calculated by using the BoltzTrap code,28 which solves the semi-classical Boltzmann equation using the rigid band approach29 under the constant relaxation time approximation. The electronic structures of ABI3 needed for these calculations were obtained by performing GGA calculations with the Monkhorst–Pack k-points mesh of 15 × 15 × 15. We calculate the Seebeck coefficients (S), the electrical conductivity (σ), the electric thermal conductivity (κe), the power factor S2σ under the assumption that the total electron momentum relaxation time τ is independent of energy. The latter approximation, though simple, has provided explanations for the thermoelectric properties of numerous systems.30–34
3. Electronic structures
The band dispersion relations calculated for (MA)PbI3, (MA)SnI3, (FA)PbI3, and (FA)SnI3 are summarized in Fig. 2. (FA)PbI3 and (FA)SnI3 have a direct band gap at (0.5, 0, 0), while (MA)PbI3 and (MA)SnI3 have a direct band gap at R = (0.5, 0.5, 0.5). In cubic ABI3 perovskites, a direct band gap occurs at R = (0.5, 0.5, 0.5).17 The low-temperature distorted phases of ABI3 do not differ much from their high temperature cubic phases so that the electronic structures of the low-temperature distorted ABI3 are quite similar to those of their high-temperature cubic structures. Thus, the direct band gap opens at R for (MA)BI3 (B = Pb, Sn). The occurrence of a direct band gap at (0.5, 0, 0) for the low-temperature (FA)BI3 arises from the increase in the unit cell size caused by the structural distortion and the concomitant folding of the Brillouin zone. The calculated band gaps of (MA)PbI3 and (FA)PbI3 are greater than those of their Sn analogues. The calculated band gaps obtained from our GGA (GGA + SOC) calculations are 1.69 (1.12), 1.62 (0.91), 0.86 (0.78), and 0.74 (0.75) eV for (MA)PbI3, (FA)PbI3, (MA)SnI3, and (FA)SnI3, respectively. The experimentally observed band gaps are 1.55, 1.48, 1.35, and 1.41 for (MA)PbI3,35 (FA)PbI3,36 (MA)SnI3,8 and (FA)SnI3,37 respectively.
 Fig. 2  Band dispersion relations calculated for (a) (MA)PbI3, (b) (MA)SnI3, (c) (FA)PbI3, and (d) (FA)SnI3. They were calculated along the high symmetry lines Γ–X–M–Γ–R for (MA)PbI3, (MA)SnI3, and (FA)SnI3, where Γ = (0, 0, 0), X = (1/2, 0, 0), M = (1/2, 1/2, 0), and R = (1/2, 1/2, 1/2) in the first Brillouin zone (Fig. S1 of the ESI†). For (FA)PbI3, the band structures were calculated along the high symmetry lines Γ–M–K–Γ–H, where Γ = (0, 0, 0), M = (1/2, 0, 0), K = (1/3, 1/3, 0), and H = (1/3, 1/3, 1/2) in the first Brillouin zone (Fig. S1 of the ESI†). 
The total DOS and projected DOS plots calculated for (MA)PbI3, (MA)SnI3, (FA)PbI3, and (FA)SnI3 are presented in Fig. 3. The VBM is composed of the Pb 6s and I 5p states for (MA)PbI3 and (FA)PbI3, and the Sn 5s and I 5p states for (MA)SnI3 and (FA)SnI3. The CBM is made up of the Pb 6p states for (MA)PbI3 and (FA)PbI3, and the Sn 5p states for (MA)SnI3 and (FA)SnI3. At the VBM, the Pb 6s–I 5p antibonding is weaker than the Sn 5s–I 5p antibonding, most likely because the Pb–O bonds are longer than the Sn–O bonds and because Pb 6s orbital is more diffuse than the Sn 5s orbital. The organic cations A+ of the perovskites ABI3 have their filled states well below the VBM, their empty states well above the CBM, and their contribution to the Fermi level is very weak. Thus, the transport properties of ABI3 are governed by the electrons or holes generated in the BI3 framework. The important role of the A+ cations is that, by rattling within the B8 cages, the A+ cations would disturb the acoustic phonon dispersions of the BI3 framework and hence lower the lattice thermal conductivity κL, as found for the rattling cations of skutterudites in their cages.38

4. Thermoelectric properties
We now compare the calculated thermoelectric properties of ABI3 compounds with those of a p-type semiconductor Bi2Te3. The Seebeck coefficients S of ABI3 calculated as a function of the chemical potential μ are shown in Fig. 4a, which exhibits two peaks at μ ≈ +0.1 and −0.1 eV. At 400 K the maximum Seebeck coefficients are ∼1600 μV K−1 for (MA)PbI3 and (FA)PbI3, and ∼800 μV K−1 for (MA)SnI3 and (FA)SnI3. The Seebeck coefficients are considerably larger for the Pb systems because they have narrower band dispersions around the Fermi level and a larger band gap than do the Sn systems. The Seebeck coefficients of the ABI3 perovskites are quite large compared with that of Bi2Te3 because the perovskites have a much larger band gap than does Bi2Te3 (Eg = 0.21 eV for Bi2Te3). In general, the electron momentum relaxation time τ of conventional semiconductors is of the order of 10−14 s.20,21,39,40 For example, τ ≈ 2 × 10−14 and 3 × 10−14 s have been reported to reproduce the experimental resistivities of Bi2Te3 and PbTe, respectively.20,21,40 Thus, in calculating the electron conductivity σ and hence the power factor S2σ for all the ABI3 perovskites and Bi2Te3, we employed τ = 2 × 10−14 s for direct comparison of their transport properties. Indeed, the calculated electronic conductivities at low carrier concentrations show a good agreement with the experimentally observed values for (MA)SnI3 (ref. 18) and (MA)PbI3.10a The dependence of the power factor S2σ on the chemical potential μ is presented in Fig. 4b, which exhibits maximum peaks around μ ≈ 0.8 eV with values slightly larger for the ASnI3 than for the APbI3 perovskites. The maximum S2σ values of ABI3 are ∼0.007 W K−2 m−1 at 400 K, which can be achieved by electron doping. On the other hand, the maximum S2σ value attainable by hole doping is an order of magnitude smaller than that attainable by electron doping as well as that of Bi2Te3. In terms of S2σ alone, the perovskites ABI3 would be expected to be a poor thermoelectric material compared to Bi2Te3 (Fig. 4b). However, what matters for thermoelectric properties is the figure of merit ZT = (S2σ/κ)T, which can be enhanced by reducing the value of the thermal conductivity κ = κL + κe.

The filled triangles in (c) indicate the κe at the chemical potentials leading to the maximum ZTs, and the numbers at the peaks in (d) refer to the carrier concentrations (in units of 1019 cm−3) at the chemical potentials leading to the maximum ZTs. The zero chemical potential refers to the midpoint of the band gap. 
The electron thermal conductivities κe calculated for ABI3 and Bi2Te3 as a function of μ at 400 K are presented in Fig. 4c. The lattice thermal conductivities κL measured for single crystal and polycrystalline samples of (MA)PbI3 are 0.5 and 0.3 W K−1 m−1, respectively.19 For Bi2Te3, the reported the lattice thermal conductivities is κL = 1.2 W K−1 m−1.20,21 Indeed, the simulated ZT value for Bi2Te3 well describes the experimentally measured one with κL = 1.2 W K−1 m−1 and τ = 2 × 10−14 s. Although the measured lattice thermal conductivity of (MA)PbI3 is 0.5 W K−1 m−1, we adopt κL = 1.2 W K−1 m−1 for ABI3 and Bi2Te3 for direct comparison of their thermoelectric properties in estimating the ZT values for ABI3 and Bi2Te3 at 400 K. The ZTs at 400 K calculated for ABI3 and Bi2Te3 as a function of μ are presented in Fig. 4d. It is noted that the optimum ZTs of ABI3 in the μ > 0 (electron-doped) region are comparable to that of Bi2Te3 in the μ < 0 (hole-doped) region. In conventional semiconducting materials, the optimum ZT is generally found for the carrier concentration around 1019 to 1020 cm−3.41 Indeed, around the chemical potential μ ≈ 0.4 and 0.8 eV, leading to the optimum ZTs of ASnI3 and APbI3, the DOS value N(μ) corresponds to the carrier concentration around 1019 to 1020 cm−3. In Fig. 4d, the values of the optimal carrier concentration for each compound are indicated in the unit of 1019 cm−3. It should be noted that, in the μ < 0 (hole-doped) region, the optimum ZTs of ABI3 are considerably smaller than that of Bi2Te3. Thus, only when they are electron doped, the perovskites would be as good a thermoelectric material as Bi2Te3. As already pointed out in introduction section, He and Galli10b evaluated the thermoelectric properties of (MA)BI3 (B = Pb, Sn) on the basis of DFT calculations using the Kane single band model.19 Their study also shows that the maximum ZT values of these compounds can be obtained from electron doping rather than from hole doping. However, their ZT values are optimized with the carrier concentration of ∼1018 cm−3, due to the use of an overestimated value for the mobility. It should lead to an extreme overestimation of the relaxation time τ as a result. We calculated the ZT values of (MA)PbI3 system by adopting various relaxation times τ to see how the relaxation time affects the ZT values as shown in Fig. S2,† which shows the ZT values to be strongly influenced by the relaxation time τ. Our work suggests that the carrier concentration of 1019 to 1020 cm−3 is needed for the optimum ZT values (see Fig. S3†).
5. Concluding remarks
The thermoelectric properties of the perovskite iodides ABI3 were compared with that of Bi2Te3 on the basis of DFT calculations. The ZTs of the electron-doped ABI3 can be as large as that of hole-doped Bi2Te3 while those of hole-doped ABI3 are rather smaller. Thus, electron-doped perovskites ABI3 are expected to exhibit as good a thermoelectric performance as does hole-doped Bi2Te3. Experimentally, it is known that the carrier density is rather low in electron-doped ABI3 perovskites. It would be an interesting challenge to see if ABI3 perovskites can be doped with a large number of electrons.

 	Fig. 1  Schematic projection views of organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites along the c-axis: (a) (MA)BI3 and (b) (FA)BI3, where M = Pb, Sn. MA = methyl ammonium (CH3NH3+), and FA = formamidinium (HC(NH2)2+). The blue, grey and black circles represent the N, C and H atoms, respectively, and purple octahedral units represent the BI6 octahedra. The C–N axis of MA and the N⋯N axis of FA cations are oriented along the c-axis, but are shown schematically to show their chemical structures.

 	Fig. 2  Band dispersion relations calculated for (a) (MA)PbI3, (b) (MA)SnI3, (c) (FA)PbI3, and (d) (FA)SnI3. They were calculated along the high symmetry lines Γ–X–M–Γ–R for (MA)PbI3, (MA)SnI3, and (FA)SnI3, where Γ = (0, 0, 0), X = (1/2, 0, 0), M = (1/2, 1/2, 0), and R = (1/2, 1/2, 1/2) in the first Brillouin zone (Fig. S1 of the ESI†). For (FA)PbI3, the band structures were calculated along the high symmetry lines Γ–M–K–Γ–H, where Γ = (0, 0, 0), M = (1/2, 0, 0), K = (1/3, 1/3, 0), and H = (1/3, 1/3, 1/2) in the first Brillouin zone (Fig. S1 of the ESI†).	 

 	Fig. 3  The calculated total DOS of ABI3 (left) and projected DOS of BI3 (right): (a) (MA)PbI3, (b) (MA)SnI3, (c) (FA)PbI3, and (d) (FA)SnI3. In the total DOS, the projected DOS for the organic cations are added with shading.	 

 	Fig. 4  Calculated transport coefficients for the organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite ABI3 as a function of the chemical potential μ: (a) the Seebeck coefficients S, (b) the power factor S2σ, (c) the electrical thermal conductivity κe, and (d) the figure of merit ZT. The filled triangles in (c) indicate the κe at the chemical potentials leading to the maximum ZTs, and the numbers at the peaks in (d) refer to the carrier concentrations (in units of 1019 cm−3) at the chemical potentials leading to the maximum ZTs. The zero chemical potential refers to the midpoint of the band gap.
