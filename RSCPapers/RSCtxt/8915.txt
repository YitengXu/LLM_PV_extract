    , Accepted 8th April 2021First published on 8th April 2021AbstractResearch progress on single layer group III monochalcogenides has been increasing rapidly owing to their interesting physics. Herein, we investigate the dynamically stable single layer forms of XBi (X = Ge, Si or Sn) using density functional theory calculations. Phonon band dispersion calculations and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations reveal the dynamical and thermal stability of the considered monolayers. Raman spectra calculations indicate the existence of 5 Raman active phonon modes, 3 of which are prominent and can be observed in possible Raman measurements. The electronic band structures of the XBi single layers were investigated with and without the effects of spin–orbit coupling (SOC). Our results show that XBi single layers show semiconducting properties with narrow band gap values without SOC. However, only single layer SiBi is an indirect band gap semiconductor, while GeBi and SnBi exhibit metallic behaviors when adding spin–orbit coupling effects. In addition, the calculated linear elastic parameters indicate the soft nature of the predicted monolayers. Moreover, our predictions for the thermoelectric properties of single layer XBi reveal that SiBi is a good thermoelectric material with increasing temperature. Overall, it is proposed that single layer XBi structures can be alternative, stable 2D single layers with varying electronic and thermoelectric properties.
1 Introduction
The tremendous interest toward two dimensional (2D) materials was initiated by the exceptional physics of graphene.1–3 Other famous 2D materials include Xenes (X = Si, Ge, Sn, P, B and so on)4–7 and transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs),8 which have shown outstanding physical features for designing advanced nanodevices.9,10 In particular, the electronic bands of graphene yield Dirac cones in the vicinity of the Fermi level, resulting in the high carrier mobilities,11 superior mechanical and thermal conduction properties,12 wide band absorption13 and other exceptional physical/chemical features. However, the semi-metallic form of graphene has limited functionality in semiconductor technology.14 In view of this, the effort continues to search stable free-standing atomic layers of semiconducting materials for a new category of 2D materials.15–25
Very recently, bismuth-based 2D materials have attracted remarkable interest due to their unique properties.26,27 Bi shows very interesting features which are highly appealing for energy related applications. In fact, the electronic features of Bi-based nanomembranes can be easily modified via the introduction of distinct anions and cations into the layered structure and the band gap can be tuned from 0.3 eV (near infrared absorption range) to 3.6 eV (ultraviolet absorption range).28,29 Moreover, Bi-based nanosheets show anisotropic p and s–p hybridization which induces remarkably dispersed electronic structures.30 Feng et al. summarized reports on the different strategies for using these as highly efficient visible-light photocatalysts by modifying the electronic band structures with anisotropic p and s–p hybridization states.31 They showed that the highly dispersed electronic structures of the Bi-layered components not only decrease the effective mass of the photoexcited charge carriers and consequently enhance the mobility, but also improve the charge separation and transmission efficiency in the photoexcitation process, which are highly desirable for employment in solar cells and thermoelectric and optoelectronic energy conversion devices.32,33 Thirdly, Bi-layered materials allow foreign ions to intercalate and to form multicomponent stable compounds without significant structural deformation due to their stable skeleton structures and large interlayer spaces.34
Other families of 2D materials are the binary compounds of group IV elements (Si, Ge, Sn) and group-III monochalcogenides with a representative chemical formula of MX (M = B, Ga, Al, In and X = O, S, Se, Te)35–40 which have honeycomb lattices and effectively consist of covalently bonded atomic planes which are held together by van der Waals interactions. These, as well as TMDs, have been extensively studied for decades due to their outstanding properties, such as remarkably high carrier mobilities, p-type electronic responses, sombrero-shape valence band edges, etc. To date, various MX systems such as InSe, GaS, GaSe and GaTe have been experimentally realized and theoretical studies have reported a stable class of single layer group IV monochalcogenides (YX, Y = Si, Ge, Sn and X = S, Se and Te) that are semiconductors with wide band gaps. Due to the above reason, we have selected silicon (Si), germanium (Ge) and tin (Sn) as chalcogens. It should be noted that anode materials based on Si, Ge and Sn show outstandingly high specific storage capacities of 4200, 1625 and 994 mA h g−1, respectively, which are very appealing for the design of more efficient rechargeable batteries.41
Motivated by the recent realization of 2D MX single layers and their novel properties, we here study the vibrational, mechanical, electronic and thermal transport properties of XBi (X = Si, Ge, and Sn) single layers by utilizing first principles calculations. It is worth mentioning that these 2D lattices have been predicted by Ashton et al.61 in 2016 and were also studied by Özdamar et al.62 Nonetheless, results presented in our work further improve the understanding on the importance of the chemical composition and structural configuration of XBi (X = Si, Ge, and Sn) nanosheets and may hopefully guide experimental studies.
2 Methods
We conducted density functional theory (DFT) simulations using the projector augmented wave (PAW) and generalized gradient approximation (GGA) potentials proposed by the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) form,42,43 employing the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP).44,45 The vdW dispersion correction was applied via the DFT-D2 method of Grimme.46 Spin–orbit-coupling (SOC) was taken into account for the electronic band structure calculations. A kinetic energy cut-off of 600 eV was considered in the DFT calculations for the plane waves.47 The hybrid functionals (HSE06)48 with SOC were also taken into account and called HSE + SOC. The Brillouin zone was sampled using a Γ-centered 16 × 16 × 1 k-point mesh for the unit cell. The geometries were optimized until the energy difference between two following steps was less than 10−5 eV, and the maximum force on atoms was smaller than 10−3 eV Å−1. A ∼20 Å vacuum was also applied along the sheet's normal direction to avoid inaccuracies due to the interactions between the monolayer images. The charge transfers were evaluated by the decomposition of charge density on the basis of the Bader charge method.49 The vibrational properties and the phonon dispersion relations were acquired via the small-displacement method using the PHONOPY code.50Ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations were also carried out to examine the thermal stability of the XBi single layers using a 4 × 4 × 1 super cell at room temperature (300 K) with a total simulation time of 6 ps with 2 fs time steps.
3 Results and discussions
In spite of reports on group IV–V compounds from experimental and theoretical studies, the lack of predictions and investigations into the hexagonal lattices of group IV–Bi compounds, namely XBi where X = Sn, Si or Ge, allows us to propose an investigation into the stability of these single layer structures. Based on this fact, we systematically studied the structural, electronic, vibrational, mechanical and thermal properties of 2D group IV–Bi binary single layers exhibiting hexagonal crystal structures. The quartic band dispersions of the predicted single layers are quite important for their thermoelectric performances.
3.1 Structure and stability
The atomic structures of the XBi single layers consist of four three-coordinated X (Si, Ge and Sn) and four-fold coordinated Bi atoms in a hexagonal unit cell containing four atoms, as shown in Fig. 1(a). In the single layer structure, 2 X layers are sandwiched between Bi layers in the order of Bi–X–X–Bi. The optimized lattice constants, a = b, are calculated to be 4.09, 4.15 and 4.35 Å, for SiBi, GeBi and SnBi, respectively, which are slightly larger than those of Ga-monochalcogenides (3.58 and 3.75 Å for single layer structures of GaS and GaSe, respectively). The bond lengths of d1 (X–Bi) are found to be 2.69 Å (Si–Bi), 2.74 Å (Ge–Bi) and 2.90 Å (Sn–Bi), while the d2 (X–X) bond lengths are slightly smaller (2.31 Å (Si–Si), 2.43 Å (Ge–Ge) and 2.80 Å (Sn–Sn)). The charge density differences of the XBi (X = Si, Ge, Sn) single layers are shown in Fig. 1(a) in the same panel, in which yellow and blue color coding represents charge depletion and accumulation, respectively. It is clear that Bi atoms are negatively charged and surrounded by X (Si, Ge and Sn) atoms that are positively charged, which reveals the charge transfer from X atoms to the connecting Bi atom. The difference in charge density (Δρ) is defined as: Δρ = ρXBi − ρX − ρBi(1)where ρXBi, ρX and ρBi represent the charge densities of XBi and the isolated atoms, respectively. Notice that each Bi atom gains about 0.04, 0.17 and 0.20 e from the adjacent Si, Ge and Sn atom in the SiBi, GeBi and SnBi single layers, respectively. The charge redistribution is due to the different electronegativities of 1.9 (Si), 2 (Ge), 1.96 (Sn) and 2.02 (Bi). The structural and electronic parameters of the XBi (X = Si, Ge, Sn) single layers are listed in Table 1. In order to calculate the cohesive energy Ecoh, the following expression is used: (2)where EX and EBi represent the energies of isolated single X (Si, Ge and Sn) and Bi atoms, ntot is the total number of unit cells and Etot represents the total energy of the XBi single layer. The cohesive energies of SiBi, GeBi and SnBi are found to be 4.77, 4.47 and 4.23 eV per atom, respectively. As a matter of fact, the more negative values for the cohesive energies confirm the greater stability, and thus the stability is higher for the lattices with lighter X atoms. We further analyze the formation energies of the predicted structures using the formula below: Efor = Ebulk(XBi)/layer − EXbulk − EBbulki(3)where Ebulk(XBi), EXbulk and EBbulki represent the total energies of the bulk form of the XBi structure and that of the individual atoms. The calculated formation energies are 0.35, 0.54 and 0.59 eV for GeBi, SiBi and SnBi single layers, respectively. The positive formation energies indicate that the predicted structures require finding an appropriate substrate for their growth, otherwise their synthesis from their native bulk lattices under ambient conditions is not probable.

The dynamical stabilities of the XBi monolayers are investigated by calculating their phonon band dispersions through the whole BZ, which are presented in Fig. 1(b). It is apparent that the phonon branches are free from any imaginary frequencies, indicating the dynamical stability of the structures. Similar to the case of single layer InSe, which has the same symmetry and crystal structure as those of XBi, XBi single layers exhibit three acoustic and nine optical phonon branches. Among the nine optical branches, three of them are found to be non-degenerate out-of-plane vibrational modes while the remaining six are three different doubly-degenerate phonon modes. The calculated Raman spectra reveal that each single layer structure exhibits three prominent Raman active modes which are described as follows: the highest frequency Raman active phonon mode has an out-of-plane vibrational character. This mode is assigned to the opposite out-of-plane vibration of the X layers and Bi layers. The frequencies of this mode are calculated to be 207, 291 and 496 cm−1 for single layer SnBi, GeBi and SiBi, respectively. In addition, the most prominent Raman active phonon mode is found to exhibit in-plane vibrational behavior. In this doubly-degenerate phonon mode, the X and Bi atoms vibrate out-of-phase in the in-plane directions which can be interpreted as the shear-like motion of the X and Bi layers. The frequencies are found to be 146, 186 and 283 cm−1 for SnBi, GeBi and SiBi, respectively. Moreover, each structure also exhibits an out-of-plane Raman active phonon mode which has a relatively smaller intensity and frequency. This mode is assigned to the out-of-plane breathing-like vibration of the top and bottom X–Bi sublayers. Its frequency is found to be 71, 82 and 89 cm−1 for SnBi, GeBi, and SiBi, respectively.
In addition, the thermal stabilities are examined by performing ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations using the NVT ensemble with a fixed particle number, volume and temperature. For the AIMD simulations, a 32-atom supercell is used for each single layer with a k-mesh of 4 × 4 × 1. The dynamical investigations start with the optimized structure of the XBi single layers at 0 K as discussed in the section on the stability of the XBi single layers. We further extend our calculations to the thermal stability at room temperature. During these simulations, the temperature is kept at 300 K, and the fluctuations of the total energy and evolution of the XBi atomic structures during the simulations are shown in Fig. 2(a)–(c). The time step is set to 2 fs and, to reach a total simulation time of 6 ps, 1000 steps are realized three times. Due to the large size of the cell, all of the calculations are performed every 2 ps. The structure snapshots are taken at the end of each simulation every 2 ps. As can be seen in Fig. 2, none of the single layers undergo structural reconstruction even at around 300 K, indicating the thermal stability of each single layer. The variation of the total energy per atom is 1 eV, which is in the acceptable range similar to many studies in the literature. In addition, as the X atom changes from Si to Sn, the single layer structure displays in-plane buckling with increasing temperature due to the different X–Bi and Bi–Bi bond formations. It can be concluded that XBi single layers exhibit thermal stability at around room temperature.

Another analysis to test the stability of the predicted material is the investigation of the mechanical properties. For this purpose, we firstly changed the unit cells of the XBi structures to rectangular cells and applied sequential uniaxial strains. The applied maximum strain ratio is 22% of the relevant lattice parameter of the rectangular cells. The obtained energies versus the lattice parameters (energy landscape) are given in Fig. 3(a)–(c). To calculate the in-plane stiffness51 we used the equation Cx,y = (1/A)∂ET2/∂εx,y2 and to find the Poisson's ratios we used the equation νx,y = εy/εx. Here, A is the unit cell area, ET is the total energy per cell of the XBi structure, and the applied uniaxial strain along the x,y axis is defined as εx,y. Because of the equivalent in-plane lattice constants of the XBi structures, we find that Cx = Cy and νxy = νyx. The calculated in-plane stiffness values are 76.96, 64.13 and 45.72 J m−2 for SiBi, GeBi and SnBi, respectively, while the obtained Poisson's ratio values are 0.279, 0.295 and 0.290, respectively. These results indicate that the in-plane stiffnesses of the XBi structures get smaller going from SiBi to SnBi. However, these in-plane stiffness values are larger than those of their individual components, silicene, germanene, stanene and bismuthene,52–54 while these numbers are almost equal to those of many transition metal dichalcogenides.55,56

3.2 Electronic properties
The intensity map band structures of the XBi single layers are shown in Fig. 4(a), which are overlaid with their electronic band structure with spin–orbit coupling (SOC) considered. The XBi single layers exhibit semiconducting behavior without SOC effects and the calculated band gaps are 0.71, 0.38 and 0.30 eV for SiBi, GeBi and SnBi, respectively. However, the inclusion of SOC shows that only the SiBi single layer is a semiconductor with an indirect band gap of 0.25 eV under the PBE + SOC functional. In addition, the conduction band minimum (CBM) of SiBi resides between the M and K points while the valence band maximum (VBM) lies at the Γ-point. The HSE06 functional is also used to evaluate the energy band gaps. We see that the HSE06 approach does not change the sort of indirect band gap, however it gives rise to an increase in the band gap to 0.65 eV. The calculated electron effective mass along Γ→K (M) is 0.15 (0.29) me*, whereas the hole effective mass is estimated to be −0.1 and −0.16 me* along Γ→K and Γ→M, respectively. These estimated light effective mass for the electrons and holes confirm the high carriers mobilities in these novel nanosheets. In contrast with the SiBi single layer, we find that the GeBi and SnBi single layers show a metallic characteristic. To better examine the contributions of the different orbitals to the electronic states and the bonding characteristics of the XBi single layers, we carry out calculations of the orbital-resolved band structures, as shown in Fig. 4(b). It is conspicuous that the states near to the Fermi energy show contributions from the p orbitals of the X and Bi atoms. It is clear that the contributions of the pz orbitals of the X and Bi atoms are much higher than that of the px,y orbitals. The fact that the pz orbitals are dominant is caused by the sp3-like bond of X and the sp2-like bond of Bi forming the SiBi single layer. In addition, the contribution of the pz orbitals can also allow the surface oxidation of the predicted structures. From Fig. 4(b) it is clearly seen that the metallicities of the GeBi and SnBi single layers are mainly composed of the pz orbitals of the Bi atoms, while the Ge or Sn atom orbitals do not contribute.

3.3 Thermoelectric properties
In order to estimate the thermoelectric properties of the XBi single layers, the semiclassical Boltzmann transport theory (BTT) within the constant relaxation time approximation and the rigid band approach as implemented in the BoltzTraP2 code is used.57,58 Using this package, and based on the electronic structure, the Seebeck coefficients (S), electrical conductivities (σ) and power factors (S2σ) are all calculated. The obtained results are given with respect to the relaxation time τ, which depends on the material’s properties, however, in this study the relaxation time is fixed to 10 fs (τ = 1014 s) as used by many studies.59,60 As seen in Fig. 5, we calculate S, σ and S2σ for various temperatures from 250 K to 500 K for steps of 50 K using the BoltzTraP2 code. It should be noted that we only give the maximum value of the Seebeck coefficients and the corresponding (σ) values for the selected temperatures. For the bare XBi single layers, we obtain high Seebeck coefficients and the calculated largest S value is for the SnBi single layer for all considered temperatures, while the smallest S value is for the SiBi single layer. With the increase of the temperature from 250 K to 500 K the S values of the XBi single layers show a decrease of more than half of the initial values. The electrical conductivities of the XBi single layers start to increase after 400 K and the σ of SiBi suddenly reaches a high value above 450 K. The efficiency of thermoelectric materials is given by the dimensionless figure of merit ZT = S2σT/κ, where T is the absolute temperature and κ is the thermal conductivity, which is the sum of the contributions from the electron (κe) and lattice (κl) parts. A high ZT can be obtained by a high power factor and a low κ value. For this purpose we calculate the power factors of the XBi structures. As can be seen in Fig. 5c, the curves of S2σ are similar to the σ curve, due to the dominant increase of σ. We note that the calculated κe values are very low, as needed for high ZT values. Notably, in order to find an exact value for ZT, the lattice thermal conductivity should be determined by the behavior of phonon transport in the XBi single layers. Moreover, in terms of the electronic features, in the case of doping, either p- or n-type, the semiconductive nature of single layer SiBi will be affected in terms of the Fermi energy level. It can be expected that the doping amount will either increase or decrease the thermoelectric power up to a certain value of the doping amount. Therefore, the effect of doping on the thermoelectric properties can also be taken into account.

The scattering region between the acoustic and optical phonon branches is important to determine the lattice thermal conductivity; a large scattering region will lower the heat flux, and thus results in a lower contribution to the thermal conductivity from phonons. As can be seen from the phonon structures of the XBi single layers (see Fig. 1(b)), the frequency of the optical modes is reduced when going from SiBi to SnBi, and the lowest optical branches of the XBi structures get closer to the highest acoustic branches, which results in narrower scattering regions. The largest scattering region of SnBi may give the lowest κl value and it has a relatively higher ZT value than the other XBi single layers.
3.4 Substrate effect
It is known that in order to synthesize a single layer structure, a suitable substrate is of importance. The two most important restrictions should be considered. The first one is the lattice mismatch ratio between the substrate and the material to be synthesized, and the second is the interaction between the two materials, which should be very weak vdW binding, to avoid the structural reconstruction of the single layer structure. By considering these two conditions we tried to find suitable substrates for the XBi single layers. For this purpose we focused on bulk materials which have similar atomic structures to the XBi materials. The calculated lattice parameters are a = b = 4.09 Å and c = 16.67 Å for bulk GaTe, a = b = 4.01 Å and c = 16.92 Å for bulk InSe and a = b = 4.25 Å and c = 17.69 Å for bulk InTe. If we cut the bulk materials from the (001) plane, the lattice mismatch ratio between the unit cells of the bulk and XBi materials becomes less than 2% which is an acceptable ratio to grow XBi on the selected bulk materials. According to the lattice mismatch, GeBi was placed on (001)GaTe, SiBi was placed on both (001)GaTe and (001)InSe, and SnBi was placed on (001)InTe substrates. Each XBi single layer was initially placed 3 Å above the selected substrate and to reduce the computational cost three layers were selected for the substrates and all atoms were released to geometric optimization. To determine the favorable stacking orientation we considered two stacking types, as illustrated in Fig. 6. The optimized structures revealed that the AB stacking type is energetically approximately 0.20 eV more favorable than the AA stacking order for all of the structures. The calculated inter-layer energies between XBi and the bulk materials for the AB stacking type are −0.400 eV for GeBi@GaTe, −0.351 eV for SiBi@GaTe, −0.289 eV for SiBi@InSe and −0.409 for SnBi@InTe. These inter-layer energies indicate that the interaction between XBi and the substrates can be considered to be vdW bonding, and these results are verified by the Bader charge analysis, where the calculated charge transfers between the layers are in the range of 0.04–0.07 e. At the end of the optimization the normal distances in the z-axis (d) between XBi and the substrates are in the range of 3.10–3.40 Å. These results show that obtained properties for the XBi single layers will not be affected much by the selected substrates due to the physisorption of the XBi single layers, with almost no net charge transfer between XBi and the substrates. In addition, the single layers on top of the substrates are relaxed at 400 K for 4 ps with ab initio molecular dynamics simulations and it is shown that the single layers do not undergo structural deformations. So, based on these results, we can conclude that our predictive results for free-standing XBi outlined in the previous sections can be useful for experimentalists, researchers who attempt to synthesize these materials.

4 Conclusion
In this study, we predicted the dynamical stability of single layer XBi (X = Ge, Si, or Sn) structures by means of first-principles calculations. The dynamical stability of each single layer was verified in terms of their phonon band dispersions while the ab initio molecular dynamics simulations revealed the thermal stability of each single layer structure. Raman spectra calculations indicated that the three structures exhibit similarities in terms of their Raman active phonon modes with distinctive phonon frequencies. The electronic band structures showed that single layer SiBi is an indirect band gap semiconductor while GeBi and SnBi exhibit metallic behaviors. Moreover, the calculated linear elastic parameters indicated the quite soft nature of the proposed single layers which makes them suitable for nanoelastic applications. Our predictions for the thermoelectric properties of single layer XBi revealed the high potential of SiBi in terms of its thermoelectric coefficient, which increases at high temperatures. Furthermore, we investigated the possible substrate effect on the structural formation of XBi single layers. It was shown that either with their small lattice mismatches or weak substrate–XBi interactions, layered GaTe, InSe and InTe are potential substrates for the experimental realization of single layer XBi structures. Overall, it was shown that single layer XBi structures can be alternative, stable 2D single layers with varying electronic and thermoelectric properties.
