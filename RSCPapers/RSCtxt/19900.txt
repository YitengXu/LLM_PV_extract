    , Accepted 4th October 2017First published on 4th October 2017AbstractDue to the many potential applications of metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), research focusing on the design, syntheses, and surface modifications of the new generation of crystalline-based MOF materials has recently received much attention. Among these materials, MOFs based on Ti–oxo clusters are potential candidates for practical applications such as photocatalysis, CO2 reduction, and pollutant degradation because of their high optical responsitivities and photoredox properties. The capabilities of Ti-MOFs in a wide range of applications are inspiring their use as a replacement for TiO2, which has recently been classified as a potential carcinogen. However, the number of tianium–organic framework structures is very limited compared to the many structures of other MOFs. In order to emphasize the importance of discovering new Ti-MOF materials and their related features, this work aims to describe the chemistry of titanium-based MOFs, including their synthetic methods, crystal structures, and topological analysis, as well as further key novel applications, which are desirable for extension to many industrial fields.
Introduction
Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) are constructed by the combination of rigid covalent bonds of organic linkers and inorganic metal ion or clusters acting as nodes, designated as secondary building units (SBUs).1 The organic linkers are also termed as SBUs from a geometrical standpoint and are used for topological analysis. Recently, almost 70000 structures of MOFs have been reported and studied, showing the tremendous development of these crystalline porous materials.2 Considered as a new class of microporous material possessing promising properties of high porosity, well-defined crystallinity, increased number of active sites, catalytic activity, etc., MOFs have been studied to address many issues, such as environmental problems,3–5 sustainable energy,6 and catalytic transformation.7,8
However, the low stability of MOFs under working conditions of high temperature and humidity as well as in fluid solvents reduces the practical applications of this material. In order to overcome this challenge, MOFs based on high valence metals and carboxylate linking units have been the subject of increasing studies. Zr(IV)- and Ti(IV)-based MOFs are candidates that not only contain strong metal–carboxylate bonds and rigid frameworks, but also demonstrate good photocatalytic properties.9–11 It should be noted that the number of these materials is still limited compared to MOFs based on di- and tri-valence metal clusters due to the high reactivity of the metal(IV) ions and carboxylate linkers, which leads to poorly crystalline or amorphous powders.11
TiO2 is known as a commercial reagent that is useful as a white pigment and in other industrial fields, such as paints, plastics, paper, foods, cosmetics, and medicines, because of its UV blocking features. However, very recently, the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) has proposed the classification of P25-TiO2 as a potential carcinogen.12 Titanium–oxo cluster-based MOFs are promising materials that may replace TiO2 in many industrial applications due to their extreme stability against harsh working conditions of high temperature and humidity and/or chemical environments.13,14 In this contribution, we seek to review the chemistry of MOFs based on titanium–oxo clusters; their synthetic methods, crystal structures, topological networks and potential applications will be described and discussed in detail.
Synthetic methods, crystal structures, and topological analysis
The syntheses of MOFs were carefully presented in early published literature reports,15 in which the formation of MOFs was described through solvothermal, hydrothermal, electrochemical, mechanochemical, and microwave-assisted synthesis methods. In some cases, slow evaporation was used to obtain large crystals that were utilized for structural elucidation by single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis.16,17 In the process of Ti-MOFs formulation, the strong interaction between highly reactive titanium sources and organic carboxylate linkers leads to difficult association and dissociation of Ti–carboxylate bonds, which results in the production of poorly crystalline products such as sols, gels or amorphous powders.11 Hence, highly crystalline Ti-MOFs can only be achieved by choosing suitable synthetic conditions, including the organic solvent, ratio of the reacted solution mixture, pH environment, and temperature. Very recently, Serre and co-workers demonstrated the Pourbaix diagrams of titanium calculated for [Ti4+] = 10−3 mol L−1 at 25 °C using Hydra and Medusa software.18 This calculation can guide the synthesis of Ti-MOFs based on consideration of the pH factor.
It should be noted that materials containing Ti-based clusters, Ti(BuOH) and MIL-91, produced by reaction of 1,4-butanediol (Bu(OH)2) and N,N′-piperazinebismethylenephosphonate, respectively, with a titanium source, were reported as early as 2006. Although Ti(BuOH) dissolves in most organic solvents, which is unusual in MOFs chemistry, its crystal structure reveals the first 3-dimensional (3-D) view of an extended titanium coordination complex.19 In the case of MIL-91, this material is the first titanium diphosphonate with well-defined porosity, showing an internal surface area of 550 m2 g−1 based on the Langmuir method.20 In this context, we focus the discussion on the details of the structural properties and applications of Ti-MOFs based on organic carboxylate linker building units.
Direct synthesis
The first Ti-MOF constructed from a 1,4-benzenedicarboxylate (BDC) linker and a Ti–oxo cluster, termed MIL-125, was reported by Serre and Sanchez and co-workers in 2009.21 MIL-125 was solvothermally synthesized using a solvent mixture of N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF)/methanol that dissolved the starting reagents, BDC and titanium(IV) isopropoxide; the mixture was heated to 140 °C in a solvothermal oven to yield a crystalline powder. Undoubtedly, MIL-125 is an exemplary material, possessing the first octameric Ti–oxo cluster and ditopic linker; it inspired other studies, including novel Ti-MOF synthesis efforts, structural modifications, and promising applications (Fig. 1).22,23

The crystalline powder of MIL-125 was obtained by solvothermal synthesis, and its crystal structure was determined by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) analysis. Indeed, the ab initio method was applied to elucidate the structure via direct methods using EXPO software. The refinement was performed through Rietveld refinement executed by Fullprof. The 3-D structure of MIL-125 revealed that MIL-125 crystallized in a body-centered tetragonal lattice with the I4/mmm space group (No. 139). The refined lattice parameters were convergent with a = b = 18.6453(10) Å and c = 18.1444(10) Å. Eight (8) oxo atoms were divided by two parallel planes, in which each plane contained four (4) oxo atoms. Ti8(OH)4 was located in the middle and parallel with two planes holding oxo atoms. The 8-member ring Ti8O8(OH)4(CO2)12 was built by the connection of 4 carboxylates on the top, 4 carboxylates on the bottom and 4 carboxylates in the middle plane, which divided the cluster into two parts (Fig. 2). BDC moieties acted as 2-connected (2-c) to link 12-connected (12-c) distorted cuboctahedra clusters to each other, resulting in a 3-D view of a crystal structure which contains triangular faces and belongs to the fcu topology. It is noteworthy that the fcu network of MIL-125, which is identical to the UiO-66 system,24 was not mentioned in the published literature. The transitivity, defined by [p q r s] (where p is the number of vertices, q is the number of edges, r is the number of faces, and s is the type of tile),25 and the natural tiling for MIL-125 were found to be [1 1 1 2] and 2[34] + [38], respectively (Table 1). The linking of these triangular faces leads to the creation of two types of pores in MIL-125. The internal diameters of the octahedral and tetrahedral cages were found to be ca. 12.55 and 6.13 Å, respectively (Fig. 2).22

Based on an organic linker containing carboxylate and hydroxyl bifunctionality, 2,5-dihydroxyterephthalic acid (H4DOBDC), which is the same link used to synthesize the MOF-74 series, Zhang and co-workers reported the structure of NTU-9 in 2014.26 NTU-9 was solvothermally produced by the reaction of H4DOBDC and titanium isopropoxide [Ti(i-OPr)4] in acetic acid. The acidic medium created by acetic acid prevented seed crystals from forming too quickly, which increased the possibility of yielding larger crystals. NTU-9 was obtained as large red crystals after 5 d of reaction in a Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave at 120 °C.
The structure of NTU-9 is a 2-D layer that contains a single pure Ti atom, in which the connection of 3 carboxylates and 3 hydoxyl groups yields a single octahedral Ti cluster. Each single cluster is bound by 3 DOBDC linking units, and the combination of these 3-c points creates an hcb network containing one type of hexagonal face with the signature of [63] tiling (Table 1). In NTU-9, the layer structure is stacked together along the c axis, constructing an 11 × 11 Å 1-D channel. The distance between the first layer and second layer, calculated from the crystal structure, is around 6 Å (Fig. 3).

In order to reduce the high reactivity and hydrolysis of titanium isopropoxide, a Ti-based complex precursor was considered for use as a reagent in the synthesis of MOFs. A hydrolytically organometallic Ti precursor, dicyclopentadienyl titanium(IV) dichloride ([Cp2TiIVCl2]), was explored to react with a flexible linker, trans-1,4-cyclohexanedicarboxylic acid (H2CDC), to generate a breathing Ti-MOF, termed COK-69.27 The microcrystalline powder of COK-69 was solvothermally produced by the reaction of [Cp2TiIVCl2] precursor and H2CDC in DMF solvent in the presence of acetic acid at 110 °C for 48 h.
COK-69 represents a triangular geometrical cluster similar to the exemplary Fe–oxo clusters found in MIL-100, PCN-332, and PCN-333.28 In particular, trinuclear Ti(IV)3(μO)O2(CO2)6 is an unprecedented Ti(IV)-based cluster in Ti-MOF chemistry. In addition, the crystal structure of COK-69 clearly reveals that this material represents the first flexible Ti-based MOF, in which the linker trans-1,4-cyclohexanedicarboxylate (CDC) can transform its conformation to adopt either the equatorial e,e′ or the axial a,a′ position. In the as-synthesized sample, COK-69 contains DMF guest molecules inside the pores; the ratio of the a,a′/e,e′ conformation was found to be 1/1. Moreover, 100% a,a conformation of the CDC linking units, proven by 13C NMR spectroscopy, was observed after the activation step to evacuate the trapped solvents (DMF). The open-pore size was calculated to be 4.9 Å, which is larger than the closed-pore size of 2.7 Å. The underlying net of COK-69 was identified after structural simplification, in which the presence of triangular clusters and ditopic organic linkers were simply reduced to 6-c and 2-c, respectively. The combination of 2-c and 6-c nodes formed an acs topology in the COK-69 structure (Fig. 4), which adopts [1 1 2 2] transitivity and two types of tiling abbreviated as [43] + [43·62] (Table 1).

Yellow balls are placed in the cages to show the pores. 
At the same time, Long and co-workers reported the first Ti-MOF based on a Ti(III)–oxo cluster29 whose structure is an analogue of MIL-101.30 The synthesis of MIL-101(Ti) was rigorously maintained under inert conditions using a glovebox and vacuum Schlenk line system. Indeed, the mixture of anhydrous DMF/ethanol was transferred to a Schlenk flask that had been charged with TiCl3 salt and 1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid (H2BDC) executed in the glovebox. The reaction solution was then heated at 120 °C under positive N2 pressure with stirring for 18 h to yield MIL-101(Ti) as a dark purple powder.
Although it shows clusters with triangular geometry, similar to COK-69, MIL-101(Ti) is the only recent example of an MOF constructed from a Ti(III)–oxo cluster and a tritopic linking block (BTC) with high porosity (2970 m2 g−1 based on the BET method).29 The conformation of the Ti(III) cluster in MIL-101(Ti) is presented in Fig. 5, in which all Ti(III) atoms are directly capped with solvent molecules (ethanol). After solvent exchange and activation under vacuum and at high temperature (150 °C), one guest solvent molecule was evaporated, leaving an unsaturated Ti(III) atom. Due to the strong interaction of O2 with Ti(III) atom, titanium(IV) superoxo and peroxo species were generated by reaction of oxygen molecules and titanium(III) complexes.31 This observation was proven by O2 adsorption measurements, in which at 25 °C, MIL-101(Ti) exhibited very steep isotherms at low pressures and reached a capacity of 0.85 mmol g−1 (2.6 wt%) at 0.9 mbar. This phenomenon is due to a chemisorption process inside the structure of MIL-101(Ti). The presence of Ti(III) atoms in the structure was proven by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) studies, which clearly showed coincidence between the relevant g values for oxidized MIL-101(Ti) and literature values.29

Crystalline 3D frameworks of metal-catecholates (M-CAT) are porous materials constructed from metal ions and catecholate-based organic units as a type of linker, similar to MOFs.32 In 2015, Nguyen et al. determined the synthetic conditions to afford the first 3-D Me-CAT (Me = V, Ti, or Fe).33 In this study, Ti-CAT-5 was constructed from H6THO [THO6− = triphenylene-2,3,6,7,10,11-hexakis(olate)] and a single titanium atom. In particular, Ti-CAT-5 was prepared by heating a solution mixture of DMF/water/methanol, dissolved titanium isopropoxide, H6THO, tetrabutylammonium nitrate, and amylamine to 180 °C for 48 h.
The 3-D crystal structure of Ti-CAT-5 was solved by PXRD and electron density map (EDM) generation through the Charge Flipping method.34 In particular, Rietveld refinement provided the convergence residual factor with Rp = 5.66%, Rwp = 8.05%. Ti-CAT-5 crystallizes in a primitive cubic lattice with a cell parameter of a = 17.996 Å and the P213 space group, as extracted from the indexing results. The SBU of Ti-CAT-5 was built by the connection of 3 catachol fragments, abbreviated as Ti(C2O2)3, which were linked to each other through THO building units. It is noted that the combination of the 3-connected nodes of the Ti(C2O2)3 cluster and THO in Ti-CAT-5 produces a 2-fold interpenetrated srs network due to the relatively large pore space (Fig. 6). The pore space of this structure, which covered two dimethylammonium (DMA) counter ions, was created by interlocking two frameworks in which the center-to-center distance between two THO linkers of the framework was found to be 6.6 Å. The discovery of Ti-CAT-5 contributed greatly to our understanding of the architectures and physical and chemical properties of MOFs as well as the promise of accessing new properties in the scope of Ti-MOFs.

Very recently, Assi et al. presented a study that utilized the synthetic scheme of reacting 2,5-dihydroxyterephthalic acid (H4DOBDC) with titanium(IV) precursors to successfully synthesize three new Ti-based MOFs, namely MIL-167, MIL-168, and MIL-169.35 MIL-167 was solvothermally synthesized by reacting a solvent mixture of N,N-diethylformamide (DEF)/methanol at 180 °C for 24 h. An alternative procedure was slightly modified to use glacial acetic acid and diethylamine in DEF solvent. The temperature was reduced to 150 °C, and the reaction time was 5 d. No explanation was provided for the presence of acetic acid and diethylamine in the alternative synthetic technique for MIL-167. A similar procedure was applied to produce MIL-168, which used catechol as the starting modulator. Moreover, MIL-169 was obtained at 150 °C in 72 h by the reaction of oxalalatotitanate precursor, H4DOBDC, and catechol in distilled water.
In terms of crystallography, MIL-168 and MIL-169 can be classified as 1-D and 2-D, respectively.35 In particular, MIL-168 was built from a connection of zig-zag chains containing Ti(IV)(CO3)2(cat) (cat = catechol) building units. In the case of MIL-169, two Ti(IV)(CO3)2 SBUs directly share the μ2-O atom, which also acts as the edge that combines two layer chains of the structure. In contrast, MIL-167 exhibited a 3-D structure in which the building unit is Ti(CO3)3 (Fig. 7). This SBU is similar to the SBU of NTU-9. However, the rotated direction of the DOBDC linking units is different from the structural geometry of NTU-9, resulting in a single frame srs topology which contains the transitivity signature of [1 1 1 1] and a natural tiling of [103].
 Fig. 7  The 3-c bulding unit of MIL-167 (a) was found to be identical to the NTU-9 building block. The linkage of Ti(CO3)3 SBUs via DOBDC building units forms the 3-D structure of MIL-167, whose topology belongs to the single frame srs network (b). Color code: O, red; C, black; Ti, blue. H atoms are omitted for clarity. 
Heterometallic approach
Direct synthesis, which involves the reaction of various titanium salts and organic linkers, is the typical method used to produce Ti-MOFs. However, the high reactivity of the titanium precursor leads to an increase in the reaction speed and a decrease in the possibility of obtaining large crystals. In order to form single crystals of Ti-based MOFs by solvothermal reaction, Cui and co-workers proposed the bimetalic synthetic strategy, in which a titanium-based metallosalan organic linking unit was initially synthesized and used as a starting reagent which was then combined with biphenyl-4,4′-dicarboxylic acid (H2BPDC) and Cd salt to form a 3-D Cd–Ti–oxo cluster-based MOF. This material was the first single crystal Ti-MOF based on a carboxylate linker and chiral salen linking unit (Fig. 8).36
 Fig. 8  Synthetic scheme for the production of bimetalic Cd–Ti-MOF-1. 
Interestingly, the linker H2L first linked to Ti(OBu)4 to generate the titanium-based salan linking unit, which is a 6-connected point of extension. The combination of the metallosalan-based building block and hexameric Cd–oxo cluster via pyridine bonds extended the structure to a 2-D framework. Finally, BPDC acted as a pillar to connect these layers to each other, resulting in a 3-D structure. The hexameric Cd-based building units stacked to create a 0.5 nm × 1.5 nm 1-D channel (Fig. 9). The topological analysis for Cd–Ti-MOF was found to be a new net, which had not been published before and does not exist in the RCSR or TOPOS databases.37,38 For future reference, we will refer to this net as the ctm topology. The connection of the 4,6-c points of extension in ctm leads to a binodal network that possesses 2 different vertices, 3 different edges, 5 different faces, and 3 different tiles. The signature for natural tiling is [4·62] + [62·82]. The metallosalan-based approach for Ti-MOF single crystal preparation was successfully applied to synthesize Me–Ti-Silan-1 (where Me equals Cd or Zn).39 Indeed, the chiral Ti–salan complex based on carboxylate and a pyridine terminal was obtained by the designed synthesis. The solvothermal reactions of Ti-metalloligand and TiL(OBu)2 with CdBr2·4H2O and Zn(OAc)2·2H2O afforded Cd–Ti-Silan-1 and Zn–Ti-Silan-1, respectively.

Using heterometallic MOFs that contain metal(II) ion and metal(IV) ion within the SBUs can reduce the complications of the MOF formulation process, such as insoluble metal oxides, which disrupt crystalline growth in Me(IV)-based MOFs.40,41 The synthetic approach that exploits the presence of bi-functionalized carboxylate and hydroxyl within the integral organic building blocks to simultaneously bond to Zn2+– and Ti4+–oxo clusters was first reported by Chun and co-workers in 2013. Taking advantage of the two metal–oxo clusters, which are stoichiometrically included in the crystal structures of ZTOF-1 and ZTOF-2, these frameworks were stabilized and crystalized in large crystals. In particular, heterometallic MOFs based on 2-hydroxyterephthalic acid (H3OBDC) and Zn6Ti2 clusters were obtained as orange crystals.40 A similar procedure was used to synthesize ZTOF-2 by a combination of an analogue linker of H3OBDC, 3-hydroxy-2,7-naphthalenedicarboxylic acid (H3ONDC), and the bimetallic–oxo cluster Zn6Ti2 in the presence of 1,4-diazabicyclo-[2.2.2]octane (DABCO), which acted as the linking pillar of the 3-D framework (Scheme 1).41

Indeed, the SBUs of ZTOF-1 was composed of Zn6Ti2 with 6 Zn atoms linked to each other through μ3-oxo linkages. Moreover, 2 tetrahedral Zn atoms in the center of the Zn6Ti2 SBU share the edge via O–O bonds from carboxylate, while the octahedral Ti atom is located at the head and terminal of the Zn6–oxo block (Fig. 10a). Simplification of the heterometallic SBUs in ZTOF-1 afforded a uninodal structure constructed by the connection of 6-connected nodes through ditopic linking units, resulting in the bcu topology (Fig. 10b). In the case of ZTOF-2, the pillar created by DABCO links the Zn3 clusters to each other and contributes to the generation of 2 tetrahedral Zn building blocks, which contain 3 Zn–O bonds and one Zn–N linkage. The last octahedral Zn atom was located in the center of the homometallic SBU. In addition, the heterometallic SBU in ZTOF-2 was formulated from 3 tetrahedral Zn atoms located in the middle of the Zn3Ti2 SBU and 2 octahedral Ti atoms, where each single Ti atom acted as a 3-connected node (Fig. 10a). In terms of topology, the Zn3Ti2 SBU was simplified as one node possessing a 6-connected point of extension. This point directly linked to the 8-c node of the pinwheel Zn3 clusters, generating an seh network (Fig. 10b). The connection of Ti atoms in the Zn3Ti2 SBU with the central Zn atoms from the pinwheel Zn3 clusters generated a 12-faced polyhedron, termed a trapezo-rhombic dodecahedron, covering the pore, which was found to be ca. 16 Å in internal diameter. It should be noted that the surface areas of ZTOF-1 and ZTOF-2 calculated by the BET method were 1045 and 1878 m2 g−1, respectively. These values are comparable with those of other highly porous Ti-MOF materials, such as MIL-125, MIL-125-NH2, and PCN-22,42 which will be discussed in the next section. The success of heterometallic-based MOFs was further investigated by Chun and co-workers. He combined Co(II)−Ti(IV) with terephthalic acid (BDC), forming CTOF-1, or 2-hydroxyterephthalic acid, producing CTOF-2, an isoreticular structure of CTOF-1.43 Both materials were formed from triangular building blocks, Co2TiO(CO2)6 SBUs, and linear building units to generate an open acs framework with intriguing dynamic properties.

Reticular chemistry method
A reversible bond association/dissociation process in Ti-MOF synthesis is extremely difficult due to the strong Ti–O bond, which is a challenge to achieving crystalline Ti-MOFs. The building block synthesis method uses the metal cluster as a starting reagent to link to the organic linker. This methodology is also known as reticular chemistry,44 meaning that the designed structures were precisely predicted by topological principles.38,44
The linking of terminal ligands to metal–oxo clusters was subsequently replaced by linking of ditopic organic units to form MOF structures. This synthetic method was reported by Guillerm et al., who synthesized UiO-66-type analogues from zirconium methacrylate–oxo cluster and the corresponding organic linkers (trans,trans-muconic acid for Zr-muconate and H2BDC for UiO-66).11 The building block approach was also applied to synthesize MIL-125 from Ti8O8(OOCC(CH3)3)16 clusters and H2BDC,22 as reported by Hendon et al. in 2013. Recently, Yuan et al. reported a similar technique using a hexameric tianium–oxo cluster, Ti6O6(AB)6(i-OPr)6 (AB = 4-aminobenzoate); this building block reagent was reacted with tetrakis((4-carboxyphenyl)porphyrin) (TCPP) to generate a Ti-MOF, PCN-22, based on the porphyrin unit. Interestingly, after formation of the MOF, the titanium–oxo cluster was found to be rearranged, yielding an unprecedented heptameric Ti7O6 cluster (Fig. 11).42

The topological analysis of PCN-22 was conducted using the TOPOS pro package,38 in which the crystal structure was initially simplified to yield a simple net through the edges and nodes. Particularly, the Ti7O6 SBU can be divided into two parts that are symmetric to each other by the octahedral Ti central atom acting as the intersection point of the C2 axis and Ti6O6 plane. In order to simplify the net, the octahedral Ti central atom was assigned as the edge linking two Ti3O3 SBUs, which were then reduced to two 7-c nodes. The TCPP linking units are clearly 4-connected nodes that combine the 7-c nodes of the Ti–oxo SBUs to generate a binodal 4,4,7-c network, showing a new topology (Fig. 12). We will refer to this net as the kim network in future discussions. It is noteworthy that the PCN-22 structure can be alternatively simplified by the connection of 4-c TCPP linking units and 12-c of the Ti7O6 cluster, forming a 4,4,12-c trinodal network with (4-c)2(4-c)(12-c) stoichiometry. Interestingly, depending on how the augment node is analyzed, 4-c of the point of extension of TCPP could be assigned as the connection of 3 3-c nodes. In this case, the topological network was found to be a 3,3,12-c net, corresponding to (3-c)8(3-c)4(12-c) stoichiometry.

In situ cluster generation
Only MIL-125 and PCN-22 were successfully obtained by the building block synthetic approach; finding a new synthetic technique to produce Ti-MOFs remains a challenge. Using robust synthetic conditions, which avoid cluster decomposition during MOF growth, in situ cluster generation was described in the synthesis of MOF-90145 and MOF-90246 reported by Nguyen et al. In particular, 4-aminobenzoic acid was first reacted with titanium isopropoxide to generate in situ Ti6O6(AB)6(OMe)6 clusters, which were then linked to each other through an imine condensation reaction by the combination of the amino functionality and aldehyde moiety. MOF-902, possessing longer imine linking units, is an isoreticular structure of MOF-901. These are the first two examples exploiting robust synthetic conditions to synthesize porous materials based on a combination of MOF and COF chemistry (Scheme 2).

In particular, MOF-901 is based on the hexameric Ti6O6(AB)6(OMe)6 cluster, which possesses 6 4-aminobenzoate terminal chelates binding to a Ti6O6 triangular prism to form 6-c points of extension. It is clear that the AB chelates are co-planar and are then linked to each other through the imine condensation reaction of the amino terminal and aldehyde functionality to yield the 2-D crystal structure. The reaction of AB and 4,4′-biphenyldicarboxaldehyde (BPDA) linking units formed the imine linker with a distance of 24.10 Å, which is longer than the 19.97 Å-imine linking blocks in the MOF-901 structure (Fig. 13). The staggered frameworks in MOF-901 and MOF-902 generated hexagonal cages, whose pore sizes were found to be 14 and 16 Å, respectively. The 2-D layer hxl topology adopting 36 faces was identified for both MOF-901 and MOF-902.

Post synthesis modification
The concept of post synthesis modification (PSM) in MOF materials was first reported by Cohen and Wang,47 who anchored an amide functional group into the framework of IR-MOF-3 through a condensation reaction. The PSM technique is useful for the synthesis of MOFs containing bulky functionalities, which cannot be obtained through direct synthesis because the geometrical hindrance of organic linkers disrupts the MOF structure. In addition, metal ion exchange by PSM results in more new materials that include bimetal–oxo clusters, which cannot be synthesized directly due to the highly reactive properties of metal salts (Ti sources or Cr salts), resulting in new attractive properties compared to the host materials.48,49
The manufacturing of Ti-based MOFs via PSM has been demonstrated by many research groups.50–52 Ti atoms were exchanged at the positions of host metal atoms in the metal cluster by immersing the parent MOFs in organic solvent containing titanium salts such as TiCl3 or TiX4 (X = Br or Cl). A UiO-66(Zr/Ti)-type structure was reported by Kim et al., showing successful exchange by an increase of the percentage of Ti atom from 53% to 94% (Fig. 14).53 MOF-5(Zn/Ti) was also synthesized by partial PSM metal exchange of Ti(III) and Zn(II). Although the percentage of Ti(III) in MOF-5(Zn/Ti) was only found to be 2%,54 this synthetic scheme provided powerful evidence that engineering the structural functionality can afford new materials (Fig. 15).

Very recently, Zhou and co-workers published a versatile synthetic route for Ti-based MOFs preparation that used the high valence metathesis and oxidation (HVMO) approach to synthesize a series of porous photoactive titanium MOFs, PCN-333(Sc)-Ti, MIL-100(Sc)-Ti, MOF-74(Zn)-Ti and MOF-74(Mg)-Ti (Fig. 16).55 Indeed, these materials were initially acquired through Sc(III) to Ti(III) or Zn(II)/Mg(II) to Ti(III) metathesis. Subsequently, the metathesized materials underwent an oxidation step, leading to the oxidization of Ti(III) to Ti(IV). The Ti atomic percentages in PCN-333(Sc/Ti), MIL-100(Sc/Ti), MOF-74(Zn/Ti) and MOF-74(Mg/Ti) were proven by ICP-MS, which displayed that high concentrations of Ti replaced Sc, Zn, and Mg atoms, respectively [88.8%, 48.8%, 94.7%, and 37.9% Ti for PCN-333(Sc/Ti), MIL-100(Sc/Ti), MOF-74(Zn/Ti) and MOF-74(Mg/Ti), respectively]. Clearly, the success of utilizing the HVMO approach to synthesize various Ti-based MOFs from MOF platforms not only introduced an effective methodology for the synthesis of Ti-MOFs, but also opened a pathway to explore the promising features of Ti-based MOF materials, such as photoresponsive properties, which are related to photocatalytic applications, and redox activity.

The oxidation reaction was then followed by metal node oxidation in air (it should be noted that PCN-333(Sc) and MIL-100(Sc) have the same topology but different structures).

Applications of Ti-MOFs
Photocatalytic applications
Semiconductor photocatalysis provides an environmentally friendly technology that exploits solar energy to convert carbon dioxide and water to hydrocarbons and oxygen. The first photocatalytic study of water splitting was demonstrated by Fujishima and Honda in 1972, in which titanium dioxide (TiO2) generated hydrogen and oxygen under UV irradiation.56 The discovery of the photocatalytic properties of TiO2 inspired the research field of photocatalysts based on TiO2 and related materials. However, the large bandgap energy (3.2 eV) of TiO2 not only limits57 its activity in the UV region, which represents only 5% of the solar spectrum, but also makes it unsuitable for some photoreactions that require high energy of the catalyst to activate the initial reagent. The first study of the photocatalytic properties of a MOFs material demonstrated the degradation of phenol by MOF-558 in aqueous solution. Although the structural transformation of MOFs based on Zn–oxo carboxylates was later confirmed by Hausdorf and co-workers,59 the photoactivities of MOFs generated more interest in the research fields of phototransformation and renewable energy.60
MOFs based on Ti–oxo clusters are materials whose redox and photocatalytic activities may be exploited in future to explore studies of their photoreactions and photocatalytic applications. As discussed in the previous section, the exemplary MIL-125 contains 8-member ring Ti–oxo clusters. These clusters are linked to each other through BDC building units. The photoresponsive properties of MIL-125 were demonstrated by the light absorption spectrum, which exhibited broad and intense bands in the visible light region (400 to 800 nm), as indicated by two maxima located at 250 and 300 nm.21,22 The band gap energy of MIL-125 was predicted based on the HSE06-calculated VB and CB energy, which was found to be 3.60 eV,22,61 which is in good agreement with the experimental estimation. Interestingly, under UV irradiation, benzyl alcohol adsorbed inside the MIL-125 framework under inert gas (nitrogen) clearly changed color from white to purple-gray-blue within a few seconds (Fig. 17).

The phenomenon of the fast photochromic effect was further explained by intervalence electron transfer hopping in the bivalence-based cluster of MIL-125, which simultaneously contained Ti(III) and Ti(IV); this was observed and proven by EPR spectra. The transition valence of MIL-125 was helpful for the photo-oxidation reaction of alcohols to aldehydes under UV light excitation. This observation, which demonstrates the photoredox activity of Ti-based MOFs, additionally suggests them to be promising candidates as potential photoactive catalysts in practical applications. The alcohol oxidation reaction of ethanol was similarly conducted using COK-69 under a UV-A (λ = 315–400 nm) light source, affording a color change from white to blue, which indicated the transfer of Ti(IV) to Ti(III).27 Although it possesses a triangular Ti(IV)–oxo cluster, COK-69 also exhibited an identical bivalence transfer phenomenon to MIL-125.
By incorporating the porphyrin-based linking unit into a highly ordered porous material, the resulting MOF, based on the high efficiency of the porphyrin antenna framework, displayed high visible light photo-responsiveness compared to MIL-125 and its derivatives. This desirable PCN-2242 structure results in a low band gap energy of 1.93 eV, which is lower than the values of 3.60 and 2.60 eV for MIL-125 and MIL-125-NH2, respectively, and corresponds to a broad range of absorption (200–640 nm) of visible light. The red-shifted visible light absorption of PCN-22 indicates that this material is an active photocatalyst that can promote the transformation of photo reactions. In particular, the oxidation of phenyl alcohol to benzaldehyde was demonstrated under a PCN-22/TEMPO catalyst system (where TEMPO = 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidinyloxyl) and various catalysts such as TiO2, TCPP, a mechanical mixture of TiO2 and TCPP, and PCN-224 (a Zr-porphyrin-based MOF). The experimental results clearly showed that PCN-22 outperformed other candidates, as indicated by the observation of a twofold higher conversion of benzaldehyde over 2 h of reaction time.
Taking advantage of its good photoresponsive properties, NTU-9 exhibited excellent properties of a p-type semiconductor in promoting the degradation of organic dyes. Indeed, the photocatalytic activity of NTU-90 was studied for the degradation of rhodamine B (RB) and methylene blue (MB) in aqueous solution under visible light irradiation (λ > 420 nm). The photocatalytic experiments showed that RB and MB were degraded completely after 80 min and 20 min, respectively.26 In addition, the photocatalytic properties and the crystallinity of NTU-9 were retained after 6 h of experimental testing, as proven by consecutive recycling results and PXRD analysis, respectively.
Currently, photocatalytic hydrogen production from water splitting is an important topic that is receiving much consideration from the chemical research community. Semiconductor-type photocatalysts are being developed to conduct this process. However, the challenge of current photocatalysts is that these materials are only activated under UV irradiation, similar to MIL-125, COK-169 or MIL-167, which accounts for only 2% to 3% of natural solar energy.62 In order to overcome these problems, photocatalysts are being modified to achieve a high optical response that can transform light absorption to the red-shifted region, resulting in low band gap energy materials. In this context, the PSM method was used to prepare materials possessing highly conjugated systems (π–π interaction liking units, using more electron-donating functional groups in the framework),9,46,63 resulting in a high photoresponse, which is attributed to ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT).64 The optical engineering approach for reducing the band gap energy of MIL-125 was introduced by Hendon et al. by exploiting the amino functional groups in the framework.65 The resulting material, MIL-125-NH2, is an isoreticular structure with MIL-125; however, it possesses a lower band gap energy compared to the host material (2.60 eV for MIL-125-NH2, compared to 3.60 eV for MIL-125). In addition, the introduction of various functional BDC-X linking units (X = CH3, Cl, OH) into MIL-125 was reported.
In 2012, Masuoka and co-workers utilized the photocatalytic activity of MIL-125-NH2 for the photocatalytic hydrogen production reaction.66 The LMCT (linker-to-cluster charge transfer (LCCT) was used in that work) mechanism was illustrated by the results of in situ ESR experiments. After 3 h of visible light irradiation, the sample was applied to measure ESR at 77 K. It is noted that the characteristic behaviour of paramagnetic Ti3+ atoms in a distorted rhombic oxygen ligand field (gx = 1.980, gy = 1.953, and gz = 1.889) was clearly observed. In contrast, no Ti3+ signal was observed on conducting an identical experiment under the same conditions using MIL-125 catalyst. This result confirmed that LMCT in MIL-125-NH2 occurred following the hydrogen production reaction, which transferred an electron from the excited BDC-NH2 functionality to the titanium–oxo cluster, resulting in the presence of Ti3+ (Fig. 18).

Taking advantage of the capabilities of a well-defined structure, the surfaces as well as the frameworks of MOFs can be easily modified through PSM to encapsulate more active molecules.67 Recently, using MIL-125-NH2 as a MOF platform to load active metal complexes for further applications of hydrogen production led to enhanced photocatalytic properties of the resulting material compared to the parent MIL-125-NH2.68,69 In particular, MIL-125-NH2 exhibited high chemical stability, suitable pore size for large molecule encapsulation, and fast light-harvesting properties, which is very important due to the necessity of charge separation and electron transport inside the material during the reaction process. In order to achieve an efficient photocatalyst for hydrogen production, van der Vlugt and Gascon and co-workers published a study that combined the phototocatalytic features of MIL-125-NH2 and cobaloxime activity to produce Co@MIL-125-NH2, which was prepared by a stepwise PSM approach (ship-in-a-bottle technique).68 Indeed, the ligand was initially loaded into the pores of MIL-125-NH2, followed by reaction of the Co2+ source with the ligand@MIL-125-NH2 processed inside the pores to create the targeted material. The hydrogen production reaction was then conducted in Co@MIL-125-NH2 and the host material MIL-125-NH2. Interestingly, the catalytically active site of the Co complex loaded into MIL-125-NH2 exhibited a 20-fold enhancement in the H2 production reaction compared to the pristine MIL-125-NH2.
Very recently, Jiang and co-workers introduced the encapsulation of a Co(II) complex, [CoII(TPA)Cl][Cl] (TPA = tris(2-pyridylmethyl)amine), acting as a molecular photocatalytic site, into MIL-125-NH2 to prepare a new photocatalyst with efficient spatial separation of electrons and holes (Fig. 19).69 The catalytic tests conducted under visible light showed that the 1.97% Co(II) complex encapsulated into the pores of MIL-125 was able to generate H2 evolution with the highest H2 production rate (553 μmol g−1 h−1) compared to 17 μmol g−1 h−1 for pristine MIL-125-NH2.

It is accepted that capturing and efficient use of CO2 are currently important issues due to the issue of global warming. Using MOF photocatalysts to convert CO2 into valuable organic products has received much attention in both academic and industrial research. In 2012, Li and co-workers reported for the first time the use of MIL-125-NH2 for CO2 reduction under visible light irradiation.70 Acetonitrile (MeCN) and triethanolamine (TEOA) were utilized as organic solvent and sacrificial agent, respectively, to conduct the CO2 reduction experiments. Under visible light irradiation and the presence of MIL-125-NH2 catalyst, the formation of formate anion (HCOO−) in the liquid phase was detected, which reached 8.14 μmol after 10 h of reaction time. This study not only opened an avenue for the application of CO2 reduction using photoresponsive catalysts such as MOFs and related porous materials, but also demonstrated the power of crystal structure modification technique in crystalline engineering for further applications;71,72 just recently, Uribe-Romo and co-workers explored the photocatalytic activity of an isoreticular series of titanium-based MIL-125.71N-Alkyl substituted MIL-125-NHR (where R = methyl, ethyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, or n-heptyl) was synthesized and fully characterized; it was also applied for CO2 reduction under blue light. The CO2 conversion using MIL-125-NHR catalyst reached a higher yield compared to pristine MIL-125-NH2, as indicated by the increased excited-state lifetime.
The framework engineering technique was further studied by Gascon and co-workers, who demonstrated the uses of PSM to extend the visible light absorption region of MIL-125-NH2 and methyl red MIL-125 (MR-MIL-125) via anchoring of antenna-like moieties.73 Very recently, the photocatalytic performance of MIL-125 and analogue MIL-125-NH2 was evaluated with increasing amounts of amino functionality. Mellot-Draznieks and co-workers reported the synthesis and characterization of MIL-125-NH2 with various percentages of BDC-NH2 in the structure (0%, 20%, 46%, 70%, and 100%).62 Although 100% BDC-NH2 was able to transform visible absorption to the red-shifted region, corresponding to decreased band gap energy, it did not achieve the best results for the benzyl alcohol oxidation reaction. The maximum photocatalytic properties of MIL-125 with mixed BDC and BDC-NH2 in the structure were found at ∼50% BDC-NH2. This finding provides an important insight to further guide linker exchange and crystal structure engineering for photocatalytic activity enhancement within MOFs.
Engineering the crystal structure of Ti-based MOFs undoubtedly leads to targeted structures possessing suitable band gap energies as well as active sites, which enhances the photoactive properties of the materials. Taking advantage of the well-defined topological networks and stability of the Ti-MOFs, the active sites were decorated either into the pores of the MOFs through interaction between the post modification motifs and the MOF framework or on the linking units via chemical reactions. Another method for post synthesis modification was reported by Yuan and co-workers, who successfully modified and synthesized graphitic carbon nitride as a support of MIL-1254 to prepare new photocatalytic systems exhibiting high photocatalytic activity for Cr(VI) reduction and dye mineralization in wastewater under visible light irradiation. Recently, Wang et al. reported the technique for in situ synthesis of In2S3@MIL-125 core–shell microparticles. This material acted as an integrated photocatalytic adsorbent, demonstrating high efficiency for the removal of antibiotics (i.e., tetracycline) in wastewater.61
Highlighted potential applications
Based on their high photoresponsitivities, MIL-125 and MIL-125-NH2 have been utilized in a wide range of photocatalytic applications. However, the biological activity of Ti-based MOF had not been reported and studied. Very recently, Silva and co-workers successfully modified fabrics, including viscose, linen, and 100% cotton, with 3-glycidyloxypropyltrimethoxysilane, followed by coating with MIL-125-NH2.74 The coated material was characterized by PXRD, UV-vis spectroscopy, FT-IR and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, which demonstrated the uniform coating of the coated fabrics. Interestingly, the modified fabrics exhibited antimosquito properties, both attracting and killing mosquitoes. The proposed mosquito killing mechanism of MIL-125-NH2 is that mosquitoes can easily find a person by sensing temperature and carbon dioxide, which was produced by the photodegradation of dimethylol dihydroxyethylene urea under the MIL-125-NH2 photocatalyst. Hence, mosquitoes were attracted to the modified fabrics. This study provides new insight into the use of MOFs materials for novel applications such as biological activity to address public health problems.
Recently, MIL-125-NH2 has been modified to achieve high crystallinity using various Ti(IV) sources such as Ti(i-PrO)4 and Ti(BuO)4 under reflux or solvothermal synthetic methods. MIL-125-NH2 synthesized from Ti(BuO)4 salt by the solvothermal method not only showed the highest internal surface area (1553 m2 g−1) compared to the other published MIL-125-NH2 material, but also exhibited an ideal S-shaped isotherm for water uptake measurement, with a steep increase at 0.2P/P0 of relative pressure at 35 °C. The water uptake capacities of Ti(BuO)4-derivative-MIL-125-NH2 were found to be 0.550 and 0.670 g g−1 at P/P0 = 0.30 and 0.92, respectively. This result outperformed comparable materials such as A520, MIL-100(Fe), MIL-100(Cr), MIL-101(Cr), and MIL-101-NH2(Cr).75
One of the most important applications in industrial fields is polymer chemistry. In particular, the global polymethyl methacrylate (polyMMA) market is anticipated to reach USD 8.16 billion by 2025.76 Hence, developing a strategy based on a new catalyst for uniform and high molecular weight polyMMA preparation is necessary. In this view, Nguyen et al. developed two new Ti-based MOFs materials, MOF-901 and MOF-902, possessing high optical response and low band gap energies (2.65 and 2.50 eV for MOF-901 and MOF-902, respectively).45,46 PolyMMA, which was prepared using MOF-901 photocatalyst under visible light irradiation, reached 26850 g mol−1 and a polydispersity index (PDI) of 1.60. MOF-902 was found to be more active than that of MOF-901, TiO2, and other related Ti-based MOFs. MOF-902 could promote the reaction of polyMMA under identical conditions used for MOF-901; however, it accounted for a molecular weight of 31465 g mol−1 and a PDI value of 1.11.
Conclusions and outlook
Although the discovery of Ti-MOFs faces challenges due to the high reactivity of the starting titanium sources, the study of the architectural design and new strategies for the preparation of new Ti-MOFs are still dramatically developing. In this review, we have summarized the progress of Ti-based metal–organic frameworks developed in just one decade, including their synthetic methodologies, crystal structures and topological descriptions, and highlighted their applications. Particularly, we would like to conclude that the synthetic conditions are an important factor that contributes to determining robust synthesis methodologies for the preparation of new MOFs. Moreover, structural features and topological networks were selectively evaluated to provide the chemistry of molecular design, topology, and the power of reticular chemistry. These factors are irreplaceable for most structural analyses, opening pathways to synthesize crystalline materials. This study contributes to the overall roadmap for further research based on the crystallographic design of novel Ti-MOF chemistry as well as post synthetic engineering for novel applications. It is fair to note that most Ti-MOF studies focus on photocatalytic applications for H2 production, CO2 conversion, organic dye degradation, and alcohol oxidation due to the structural properties of Ti-MOFs, which are correlated to their photoactivities. This may lead to the development of a new Ti-based MOF that is not only stable in harsh conditions and provides sufficient power for water oxidation, but can also reduce the gap between academic research and practical applications.
