    , Accepted 26th January 2015First published on 2nd February 2015AbstractArrays of hyperbranched high aspect ratio mesostructures are grown by pulsed laser deposition through a self-assembly process from the gas phase. These hierarchical arrays are successfully used as photoanodes for the photoelectrochemical splitting of water, exhibiting an onset potential as low as 0.4 V vs. RHE and saturation current densities up to 1.85 mA cm−2 at 0.8 V vs. RHE. While the latter is similar to the state of the art values for WO3 nanostructured photoanodes, both the onset and saturation voltages are significantly lower than any other reported values. This peculiar behavior is attributed to the hyperbranched structure and to its excellent optical and electronic properties.
Introduction
Since Fujishima and Honda's discovery in 1972,1 the research on materials capable of splitting water into its components and thus able to produce hydrogen through the use of solar radiation has greatly increased, leading to a comprehensive body of research of materials and morphologies capable of performing this task. Materials with suitable energy levels,2–5 both for the absorption in the visible range and for the correct energetic alignment with respect to the water electrolysis potentials, are being researched. This path includes experimenting with new materials, as well as modifying the already-known materials through doping6–10 in order to change their inherent opto-electrical properties. Morphological modifications and nanostructuring11–15 are employed to increase the photoelectrochemical performances of the devices, either by improving the charge-transport properties of the structures or enhancing the photogeneration of charges and thus the resulting photocurrent. Mesoporous materials16–20 with high surface areas and internal scattering are characterized by higher optical density than their compact counterparts and high chemical reactivity due to extended interfaces with the electrolytic solution. On the other hand, one-dimensional morphologies, such as nanotubes,21–24 nanowires21,25,26 and nanorods,27–29 exhibit enhanced charge-transport properties, as the dimensional confinement of their structures results in direct charge-diffusion pathways with reduced resistance. Highly crystalline structures30,31 can further enhance this effect by reducing the density of grain boundaries and defects, which constitute charge recombination sites.
Due to its band gap of approximately 2.6 eV, the favorable alignment of its energy levels4 and good chemical stability in acidic environments, tungsten trioxide (WO3) is one of the transition metal oxides currently the focus of numerous studies. The respective theoretical performance limit of WO3, estimated based on its band gap, is 5 mA cm−2 for the photocurrent and 6% for the solar-to-hydrogen (STH) efficiency.32 Photoanodes made by WO3 nanoparticles33,34 have been thoroughly studied and optimized, reaching photocurrents up to a range of 2.5 mA cm−2 with layers as thin as 2.5 μm.35 Although well performing, nanoparticle films require a high applied bias to operate efficiently, due to the high number of grain boundaries that limit charge transport and enhance charge trapping;36 moreover, the rather high density of the material also hinders its eventual use as a scaffold for subsequent sensitization processes. One-dimensional morphologies,26,37,38 despite the improved charge-transport properties, generally lack the surface area and optical density values required to obtain high photocurrents.
The concept behind this study is to develop a WO3 photoanode that combines the convenient properties of nanoparticle films with those of 1D morphologies: high volumetric surface area and long-range crystalline order with enhanced charge-transport properties. To achieve such a concept, hierarchical hyperbranched nano-trees have been developed, exploiting gas-phase self-assembly using the pulsed laser deposition (PLD) technique.30,39 As an internal benchmark, non-hyperbranched yet hierarchical samples have been produced with PLD, showing an onset potential similar to state-of-the-art WO3 devices present in literature. The thorough comparison between these two closely-related materials allows some general conclusion to be drawn on the relevance of facet selection and trap density in photoelectrochemical water-splitting systems.
Results and discussion
As for previous studies that employed the PLD setup for depositing transition metal oxides,30,39–41 the operational parameters of the deposition are herein optimized to obtain hierarchical WO3 nanostructures. In order to show the inherent benefits of a hyperbranched structure in comparison to a less-ordered crystalline configuration, two different types of samples fabricated by PLD are used throughout this study: hierarchical hyperbranched WO3 nanostructures (HYP) and hierarchical WO3 nanostructures lacking long-range crystalline order (HIE).
SEM images (Fig. 1a and b) show the distinctive tree-shaped growth shared by both sample types, comprising a main stem perpendicular to the sample surface from which numerous branches develop, themselves having their own ramifications. This complex hierarchical structure is defined within a conical envelope forming an angle of 15–20° with the main growth axis. At higher magnification (Fig. 1c and d), it is possible to clearly distinguish the two nanostructures with the HYP structure being more ordered than that of HIE.
 Fig. 1  SEM images of the top (a) and cross-sectional (b) views of the nano-tree morphology. High-magnification SEM images of cross-sectional views for both the HYP (c) and HIE (d) samples. 
TEM images (Fig. 2a and b) show branches developing preferentially towards the b direction of the primitive cell and with lattice spacing that matches the WO3 (monoclinic α-phase) structure. In the HYP sample, lattice fringes indicate crystalline domains sharing planes along the [001] direction, resulting in larger aggregates with fewer defects. The high degree of crystallinity results in faceted, clean surfaces (Fig. 2c).

The preferential growth along the [020] direction is confirmed by XRD spectra (Fig. 3), where both the HYP and the HIE samples show a high intensity of the (020) diffraction peak compared with the reference powder (labelled as REF). The relative peak height, normalized by the intensity of the adjacent (200) peak, is 1.9 times the reference powder value for the HIE sample and 3.4 times the reference powder value for that of HYP.

The light absorption properties of the film are studied through the absorptance (100 − T − R) spectra, measured for both morphologies on the 20 μm-thick samples (Fig. 4a). Since the optical measurements are performed by shining light on the glass sides of the devices, the contribution of the WO3 film alone is obtained by subtracting the spectrum of a clean glass plus FTO from the experimental data. For photons with energies above the optical band gap of WO3 (λ < 470 nm) the integrated light absorption gradually increases and reaches a maximum value of around 90% for the WO3 film on glass plus FTO and of around 70% for the WO3 film only. A significant tail towards the infrared range (λ > 470 nm) is observed for all samples, its intensity increasing with film thickness, and it is attributed to several factors. The constant portion of this contribution comes from the bare glass plus FTO substrate: light with high scattering angles is reflected back or exits through the glass side and is thus lost during the measurement. The portion that scales with film thickness is related to the scattering properties of the WO3 nanostructures, which is useful for increasing the light path length through the device and thus the overall absorption of the device. However, the secondary effect of this optical feature is to enhance the back and lateral scattering, resulting in light lost during the measurement that is related to the amount of scattering material present in the film.

(b, solid) IPCE and (b, dashed) APCE spectra of the HYP and HIE 20 μm-thick samples, measured by shining light from the glass side and with an applied bias of 1 V vs. RHE. 
Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves are herein shown for both the HYP and HIE morphologies deposited with PLD as a function of film thickness (Fig. 5). The saturation photocurrent increases with film thickness for both the HYP and HIE morphologies. The HIE samples reach saturation with the 20 μm film, with a photocurrent value of 1.77 mA cm−2 at 1.3 V. Conversely, the HYP samples reach saturation with the 10 μm film, with a value of 1.85 mA cm−2 at 0.8 V, and further improve the performances with the 20 μm film, showing higher photocurrent values in the voltage range below saturation. Although the saturation photocurrents between the two batches are similar, the photocurrent onset potential and the entire photocurrent slope profile experience a consistent shift between 100–150 mV towards higher voltages as the nanostructure loses its hyperbranched morphology, with the HYP samples showing an onset voltage of 0.4 V and the HIE samples of 0.5 V. Moreover, the photocurrent exhibited at low biases by the HYP morphology is stable for an extended period of time as shown by chronoamperometry (see Fig. S3†).

The efficient charge generation and charge injection of the hyperbranched nanostructures can be appreciated from the IPCE spectra (with light shining from the glass side and an applied potential of 1 V vs. RHE) performed on the 20 μm-thick samples, together with the calculated APCE spectra (Fig. 4b). The IPCE profile shows an onset at approximately 500 nm and a peak value of around 400 nm, with a maximum IPCE of 56% and 63% for the HIE and HYP samples, respectively. The trend of the IPCE spectra with sample thickness (Fig. S2†) shows a gradual increase of the curve steepness near the absorption band edge. This behavior reflects how thicker samples are capable of saturating light absorption due to enhanced light-scattering properties and thus achieve a higher values of internal conversion efficiency close to the band edge, without losing their performance due to transport-related issues. For nanoparticle films, thick samples generally have higher values of light absorption due to the increased optical density of the film, but suffer from transport-related issues as the charges photogenerated deep within the material have a higher chances of recombining over long distances. Quasi-1D morphologies deposited by PLD are capable of overcoming this limitation by decoupling charge diffusion from light absorption. While photogenerated electrons travel through the entire nano-tree height, holes can diffuse perpendicularly to the nano-branch axis to reach its surface and be injected into the electrolyte. This is a crucial point because hole diffusion length for monoclinic WO3 has been estimated to be around 150 nanometers:32,42 hole diffusion paths in the film are shorter than that value, leading to efficient hole injection, and are independent from film thickness as they are related to average crystallite size. Electron diffusion pathways are instead oriented along the nano-branches axis and toward the FTO contact, with the average distance related to the depth at which charge photogeneration occurs. Incident light shined on the glass substrate is first absorbed by the “roots” of the nano-trees, thus photogenerating a consistent amount of charges in the spatial region within the first few micrometers of the film, very close to the film/FTO interface. In this way, the optical density can be enhanced by increasing the film thickness up to saturation, without lengthening the diffusion pathways of the electrons photogenerated in the first spatial region and thus allowing to increase the internal conversion efficiency without any transport-related issue.
The transport, recombination and charge accumulation properties of the material are extracted from electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) spectra (see Fig. S4†) and plotted as a function of thickness for the two different morphologies (Fig. 6). The electrochemical parameters—and the physical meaning they carry—employed to simulate the working device via the equivalent electrical circuit approach (see Fig. S5†) are taken from the previous studies of the Bisquert group on mesoporous transition metal-oxide photoanodes in an aqueous electrolyte.43–45 Charge recombination resistance Rrec describes the charge-transfer kinetics of electrons recombining with the surface states/species in the solution. HYP samples show a higher values of charge recombination resistance than their HIE counterparts as the increased crystalline size and improved long-range order reduce the number of film/solution interfaces and increase the path length for transversal electron diffusion (Fig. 6a). Charge recombination resistance for both the morphologies is almost constant with the thickness as the crystallinity of each configuration is not influenced by the film thickness. Chemical capacitance Cμ is related to the distribution of trap states below the conduction band. From the experimental measurements (Fig. 6b), chemical capacitance follows a linear trend with sample thickness for both morphologies, with the HIE samples displaying a higher slope than those of the HYP. The increased chemical capacitance in the HIE samples is attributed to the higher density of trap states due to a more defective crystal lattice of the nano-tree branches. Electron lifetime τn is calculated as the product of charge recombination resistance and chemical capacitance.46 The persistence of photogenerated electrons in the conduction band is related to two different processes: the trapping–detrapping events, which delay the electron movement and prolong their presence in the conduction band (related to chemical capacitance Cμ) and the electron transfer towards recombination centers at the electrolyte interface (related to charge recombination resistance Rrec).τn = CμRrec
 Fig. 6  Electrochemical parameters extracted from EIS measurements as a function of thickness for the two different morphologies: charge recombination resistance (a), chemical capacitance (b) and electron lifetime (c). Charge transport resistance (d) is shown for the HYP samples only. 
As the product of two experimental parameters with opposing effects on overall charge transport, the calculated values of electron lifetime τn (Fig. 6c) can be somehow misleading without the correct premises. A high charge recombination resistance is desirable as it reduces the chances of the electron travelling towards recombination centers, leading to an actual increase in the electron lifetime in the conduction band. On the other hand, a high chemical capacitance means more defect states where electron trapping–detrapping events can occur. Although this effect prolongs the electron lifetime in the conduction band, it takes place through delayed processes and thus hinders electron transport in the structure. Charge transport resistance Rtr (Fig. 6d) represents the resistance of the entire nanostructured film and as expected in the first approximation it increases with film thickness. It was possible to extrapolate this parameter only for the HYP samples due to the presence of artifacts in the high frequency region of the Nyquist plot of the HIE samples (see Fig. S4†). Electron diffusion length Ln for the hyperbranched morphology is hence calculated from the two resistance parameters and the film thickness L.47,48 The value is constant with thickness because it is a property of the morphology itself and is around 17 μm, which is in good agreement with the trend shown in the LSV plots by the photocurrent (see Fig. 4), that starts saturating for similar values of film thickness.  
Morphologies with a lower crystalline order needs higher applied voltages to efficiently extract electrons due to the increased amount of grain boundaries with high defectiveness; thus, a higher applied bias is required to start oxidizing water. A possible synergistic mechanism contributing to this behavior could be that directional growth along the b-crystalline axis forces the photo-oxidation of water to take place mainly at the [200] and [002] crystalline surfaces, where the evolution over-potential has been calculated to be 50–60 mV lower than the over-potential shown by the [020] surface.49
Conclusions
In summary, quasi-1D WO3 nanostructures are deposited by PLD and by tuning the deposition parameters, hyperbranching and long-range crystalline order is achieved. Both hierarchical tree-like structures present efficient light absorption and internal scattering with enhanced charge collection efficiency despite the large thickness due to the mesoporous structure of the film. The difference between the two configurations becomes evident in the electrochemical results: both morphologies present a photocurrent saturation value of around 1.8 mA cm−2, but the onset voltage of the hyperbranched samples is 0.4 V vs. RHE, approximately 100–150 mV lower than the samples without hyperbranching. The entire photocurrent trend is shifted towards a lower potential, and the slope of the curve is increased for the hyperbranched samples, reaching saturation at an early value of 0.8 V vs. RHE.
A comparison with state-of-the-art photoanodes taken from the literature35,50 (Fig. 7a and b) shows that despite a lower photocurrent, hyperbranched samples deposited by PLD exhibit a major advantage in the low-bias region due to their reduced photocurrent onset potential. On the other hand, the hierarchical samples present a photocurrent onset and slope similar to that of nanoparticle films taken from literature. These improved performances are attributed to the long-range crystalline order of the hyperbranched morphology with directional growth three times more pronounced than the reference monoclinic WO3 and crystallites in the order of 100 nm, which results in enhanced charge injection and charge transport properties. Longer crystals yield fewer grain boundaries, where charge recombination can occur, and the elongated directional growth of the branches favors the transport of the electron towards the FTO contact along the tree axis. Moreover, the preferential exposure of the [200] and [002] crystalline surfaces is believed to lower the overpotential for water oxidation. Quasi-1D hyperbranched WO3 nanostructures represent a promising morphology for the realization of water-splitting photoanodes and hold a promise for future doping or sensitization experiments due to their high surface area and directional porous structure. Despite the fact that the saturation photocurrent values are lower than the best performing devices present in literature, the low onset potential and high curve steepness represent an unprecedented case for water-splitting photoanodes that allow to achieve high values of photocurrent at low applied bias.

Experimental section
Film growth
The tungsten-trioxide nanostructures are deposited via PLD, ablating a tungsten-trioxide target with laser pulses from a KrF excimer laser (wavelength, 248 nm; repetition rate, 20 Hz) within a vacuum chamber (base vacuum in the order of 10−3 Pa) filled with O2 background gas up to the desired working pressure. Briefly, in PLD, a laser pulse impinges on the target that is locally vaporized and partially ionized, generating plasma that expands supersonically towards the substrate. The ablated species condense on the substrate, forming a film, the properties of which can be controlled by varying background gas pressure, laser fluence and target-to-substrate distance. In a certain processing window, typical for each material, it is possible to induce gas-phase nucleation of clusters, which are then scattered upon interaction with the background gas, causing the self-assembly of arrays of quasi-1D nanostructures, with a typical diameter of hundreds of nanometers and heights linear with the deposition time.30
Quasi-1D hyperbranched and hierarchical WO3 photoanodes are grown on 2.3 mm thick soda-lime glass slides coated with an FTO conductive coating (sheet resistance of 15 Ω sq−1). All samples were deposited at room temperature, yielding amorphous films. The crystalline phase transition is achieved through a post-deposition annealing treatment, performed in a muffle furnace in air for 2 h at 500 °C. Similar to the previously reported hyperbranched TiO2,30 different background pressures yield WO3 films ranging from compact to extremely porous, with a small operational window, where hyperbranched nanostructures are obtained. The range for hierarchical structures is found between 10 Pa and 60 Pa (with a target-to-substrate distance of 5 cm and a laser fluence of 3.4 J cm−2), with an optimum value to obtain hyperbranching of 20 Pa oxygen of background pressure and a film growth rate of 2.4 nm s−1. Out of this window, for example, increasing laser fluence and keeping all other parameters constant, morphologies that still display characteristic tree-shape hierarchical structure but lose the hyperbranched nature are obtained. This control on the morphology and structure of the films is exploited to obtain the hyperbranched (HYP) and hierarchical (HIE) photoanodes discussed in this study.
Characterization
Film morphology is investigated using a Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (Zeiss SUPRA 40) and a High Resolution Transmission Electron Microscope (JEOL 4000EX with an LaB6 filament operated at 400 kV accelerating voltage). Additional information on the crystallinity of the films is obtained through X-ray diffraction (Philips X'Pert, Cu Kα radiation, Hanawalt phase identification method on PDF-2 dataset).
The optical properties of the samples are measured with a UV/VIS/NIR spectrometer (Perkin Elmer Lambda 1050) operating with an integrating sphere. The absorptance is calculated from the experimental transmittance and reflectance data with the following formula:A = 100 − T − R,where A is the absorptance, T is the transmittance and R is the reflectance.
LSV measurements were carried out using a potentiostat/galvanostat (Autolab PGSTAT 30) with a scan rate of 20 mV s−1 in a three-electrode configuration with a WO3 sample as the working electrode, a platinum wire (surface area of 0.8 mm2) as the counter electrode and Ag/AgCl in saturated KCl as the reference electrode; the electrolyte is an aqueous solution of 1 M H2SO4 with a pH of 0; and illumination is provided by a Class AAA solar simulator (Oriel Model 94063A) that simulates the AM 1.5G solar spectrum with an average intensity of 100 mW cm−2.
EIS measurements employ the same setup as LSV and are performed by applying a 20 mV amplitude perturbation between 10000 Hz and 0.01 Hz at a voltage of 0.7 V vs. RHE. The applied bias chosen for the EIS measurements is the potential of maximum power output for the devices realized with HYP samples (see Fig. S1†).
Incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) spectra are obtained using the same three-electrode configuration previously described with a 150 W xenon lamp coupled with a monochromator (Applied Photophysics; 1200 lines per mm; band-pass, 10 nm). The bias potential is applied with a potentiostat (AMEL model 552), the photocurrent signal is recorded with a multimeter (Agilent 34401A, 6 1/2 digits), and the incident irradiance is measured with a calibrated silicon photodiode (Centronic OSD 7Q). The final IPCE values are calculated from the experimental data according to the formula  where J is the photocurrent density, λ is the wavelength of the incident light, and P is the radiant power density at that given wavelength. Absorbed photon-to-current efficiency (APCE) spectra are hence calculated using the following relation  where A is the actual absorptance of the mesoporous film, obtained by subtracting the absorptance of the bare glass plus FTO, forming the absorptance of the whole sample.

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  SEM images of the top (a) and cross-sectional (b) views of the nano-tree morphology. High-magnification SEM images of cross-sectional views for both the HYP (c) and HIE (d) samples.	 

 	Fig. 2  High-resolution TEM images of the HIE (a) and HYP (b and c) samples. The HYP sample, imaged from the [100] zone axis, shows high crystalline quality and clean surface terminations (c). The inset show the Fast Fourier Transform of the lattice, where the main spacings are highlighted.	 

 	Fig. 3  XRD spectra of the HYP and HIE samples, together with the reference peaks of the WO3 monoclinic phase represented by REF.	 

 	Fig. 4  (a) Absorptance spectra of the HYP and HIE 20 μm-thick samples, with the contribution of glass plus FTO (dashed) and without (solid). (b, solid) IPCE and (b, dashed) APCE spectra of the HYP and HIE 20 μm-thick samples, measured by shining light from the glass side and with an applied bias of 1 V vs. RHE.	 

 	Fig. 5  LSV curves of the HYP and HIE samples as a function of film thickness, performed under chopped light in an aqueous solution of 1 M sulfuric acid (H2SO4).	 
τn = CμRrec

 	Fig. 6  Electrochemical parameters extracted from EIS measurements as a function of thickness for the two different morphologies: charge recombination resistance (a), chemical capacitance (b) and electron lifetime (c). Charge transport resistance (d) is shown for the HYP samples only.	 

 		 

 	Fig. 7  (a) LSV curves of the HYP and HIE 20 μm-thick samples performed under chopped light in an aqueous solution of 1 M sulfuric acid (H2SO4), the 2.5 μm-thick sample from Brillet et al.35 and 2 μm-thick sample from Santato et al.50 performed under continuous light in a 1 M perchloric acid (HClO4). (b) Histogram comparison of the photocurrent values at different applied voltages.
