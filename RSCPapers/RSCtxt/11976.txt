    , Accepted 19th June 2019First published on 20th June 2019AbstractHydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and superoxide radical (O2˙−) play a critical role in environmental remediation technologies. Here, we report on metal-free co-catalysts with the in situ incorporation of carbon dots (CDs) into a polymeric O and N co-linked carbon nitride (OCN) framework, which significantly enhanced the synthesis of H2O2 and O2˙− due to dual reactive sites. For the photocatalytic degradation of a typical pharmaceutical and personal care product (PPCP), CDs/OCN demonstrated excellent photocatalytic performance in contrast to g-C3N4 and OCN, which was 11.6 times that of pure g-C3N4. The trapping experiment has shown that O2˙− plays an important role in the degradation of DCF. CDs/OCN exhibited higher electron–hole separation efficiencies than g-C3N4 and OCN, as the result of the excellent transfer and storage performance of the CDs. The yield of H2O2 generation by CDs/OCN was higher than that by g-C3N4 and OCN. Meanwhile, the electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra revealed that additional O2˙− and ˙OH were generated via the CDs/OCN system. Density functional theory (DFT) and Raman spectroscopy analyses revealed the presence of CD/OCN-resident dual reactive sites, which had distinct selective oxygen reduction capacities. We observed that O2 was more prone to 2-electron reduction on OCN, whereas O2 was more easily reduced to O2˙− on the surface of CDs through the additional e− provided by OCN. This study clearly demonstrates a simple strategy for the design and synthesis of metal-free materials in the preparation of H2O2 and O2˙− toward the degradation of organic pollutants.

Environmental significance
Water environment issues have become a huge challenge for us. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), which is a well-known antiseptic, serves as one of the crucial oxidants in traditional advanced oxidation processes (AOPs), and is widely employed in environmental remediation. Additionally, the efficiency of the synthesis of H2O2 was limited by the four-electron reduction of O2 (water formation) and the one-electron reduction of O2 (O2˙−). However, O2˙− also played a significant role in the photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants. In this paper, we report on metal-free co-catalysts with the in situ incorporation of carbon dots (CDs) into a polymeric O and N co-linked carbon nitride (OCN) framework, which significantly enhanced the artificial photosynthesis of H2O2 and O2˙− due to dual reactive sites. This study clearly demonstrates a simple strategy for the design and synthesis of metal-free materials in the preparation of H2O2 and O2˙− toward the degradation of organic pollutants.

1 Introduction
Pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) are a class of emerging contaminants that typically encompass medicinal, cosmetic, and personal hygiene products. Due to their stable chemical structures and recalcitrance to biological degradation, PPCPs have been widely detected in surface water, groundwater, seawater, and even potable water on a global scale.1–4 These contaminants have become a great concern to society in light of their potentially hazardous impacts on ecological security and human health.5 Diclofenac (DCF) is a common non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), which is extensively employed as a pain killer.6 Studies revealed that the maximum concentrations of DCF in medical and pharmaceutical manufacturing wastewaters were 6.88 μg L−1 and 203 μg L−1, respectively, in South Korea, which were significantly higher than levels typically detected in municipal wastewater.7 Hence, it is critical that effective strategies be developed for the degradation of DCF in ambient waterways.
Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), which is a well-known antiseptic, serves as one of the crucial oxidants in traditional advanced oxidation processes (AOPs), and is widely employed as a clean oxidant for various chemical industries and environmental remediation.8,9 The strong oxidation power of hydroxyl radicals (˙OH) has been broadly exploited for the non-selective degradation of refractory organic pollutants in water treatment processes.10,11 In typical AOPs, H2O2 is activated by various schemes for the generation of ˙OH, and is in high global demand (2.2 Mt per year) for fundamental industries such as electronics, disinfection, paper bleaching, and water treatment.12,13 H2O2 can be produced by the anthraquinone method via the H2 and O2 reaction, or proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) through the reduction of O2 (O2 + 2H+ + 2e− → H2O2; E0 = 0.695VNHE).8,14–17 In contrast to traditional methods, the synthesis of H2O2 through PCET has the eco-compatible advantages of no pollution and low energy consumption, as it requires only O2, water, and solar exposure.18–20 Recently, Hyo Won Kim et al. reported that RGO exhibited selective and efficient electrochemical oxygen reduction to H2O2, which was attributed to C–O–C ring defects.21 Further, Zhiyi Lu et al. prepared oxidized carbon-based materials that exhibited higher selectivity in the electrocatalytic generation of H2O2, due to the formation of several functional oxygen groups (C–O–C and –COOH) that are preferred for the two-electron reduction of O2.22
Most metal oxide semiconductors are extensively employed for photocatalytic conversion and photosynthetic applications; however, most of these are activated only by UV light, and the production of H2O2 has a robust affinity to the oxide surface.23 As a visible light responsive photocatalyst, metal-free graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) has been intensively investigated due to its many merits, such as high thermal and chemical stability, a suitable bandgap (∼2.7 eV), low cost, non-toxicity and so on.24,25 Recently, Shiraishi et al. was the first to report that g-C3N4 has a good capacity for the generation of H2O2 due to the formation of 1,4-endoperoxide species.26 Zhen et al. synthesized oxygen-enriched graphitic carbon nitride polymer (OCN) materials via the copolymerization of dicyandiamide and ammonium paratungstate, which showed that OCN was more conducive to photocatalytic oxygen reduction in the synthesis of H2O2. The results of theoretical calculations revealed that O-linked heptazine-based carbon nitride organic polymers more easily facilitated the photocatalytic reduction of O2 to synthesize H2O2. However, this preparation method resulted in the generation of a large quantity of W elements, and the indistinct position of O.14 Recently, oxygen- and nitrogen-linked heptazine-based carbon nitride organic polymer (OCN) photocatalysts were successfully synthesized via the thermopolymerization of semicarbazide hydrochloride as a precursor.27 Additionally, the efficiency of the synthesis of H2O2 was limited by the four-electron reduction of O2 (water formation, O2 + 4H+ + 4e− → 2H2O) and the one-electron reduction of O2 (superoxide radical formation, O2 + H+ + e− → ˙OOH).28 However, superoxide radicals (O2˙−) also played a significant role in the photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants. Therefore, the structural characteristics of semiconductors toward the highly efficient production of H2O2 and O2˙− for water treatment processes are very important.
As one of the reactive oxide species (ROS), O2˙− could decompose organic pollutants into small molecules, even CO2 and H2O.29,30 Furthermore, O2˙− could be reduced to ˙OH via a series of chain reactions and result in faster contaminant degradation.31 Our previous studies showed that CDs effectively transferred electrons from the semiconductor (such as TiO2, g-C3N4, BiPO4, and so on), which more easily formed O2˙−via the one-electron reduction of O2 on the surface of CDs.32–35 Carbon dots (CDs) may be hydrothermally synthesized via citric acid and urea, which results in the production of several oxygen functional groups (C–O–C and –COOH) and properties such as excellent up-conversion performance and the transfer of photogenerated carriers that enhance the photocatalytic activity.32–34 Inspired by conjugated carbon materials (e.g., g-C3N4, RGO, and carbon nanotubes) that have excellent H2O2 production properties and superior performance of the CDs, we designed and synthesized carbon materials with dual functional sites via a CDs/OCN composite, which facilitated visible light-driven oxygen reduction to superoxide radical and hydrogen peroxide, simultaneously.
In this paper, a highly efficient visible light photocatalyst (CDs/OCN) was synthesized through a facile hydrothermal–polymerization method, and was employed for the degradation of DCF under different light irradiation. The photocatalytic performance of CDs/OCN in the degradation of DCF was evaluated under blue light irradiation. The yields of H2O2 and O2˙− have been detected by photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy and ESR. Further, the physicochemical properties and the mechanism of the enhanced photocatalytic activity of CDs/OCN were systematically deduced. Furthermore, the photocatalytic degradation kinetics were investigated via probable degradation pathways, electron spin resonance (ESR), and HRAM LC-MS/MS. The mechanism of the photocatalysis has been systematically propounded by Raman spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT).
2 Experimental
2.1 Preparation of photocatalysts

Preparation of CDs. 
All reagents used in this research were analytically pure and employed without further purification. Carbon dots (CDs) were synthesized through a hydrothermal method.36 In a typical process, 3.0 g of citric acid and 1.0 g of urea were dissolved in 10 mL of DI water under ultrasonication. Subsequently, the mixture was transferred into a 100 ml Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave and heated at 180 °C for 5 h. After cooling to room temperature, the acquired brown solution was centrifuged at 14000 rpm for 10 min, to remove any large particles. Consequently, the CD solution was dried overnight in an air-circulating oven at 70 °C to obtain a CD powder. Ultimately, the obtained CD powders were completely dissolved in 100 ml DI water through ultrasonication to obtain 20 g L−1 stock solutions.


Preparation of g-C3N4 and OCN. 
Typically, the precursors (dicyandiamide for g-C3N4 and semicarbazide hydrochloride for OCN) were placed into a high-quality alumina crucible with a lid, which was placed in a muffle furnace at a constant temperature of 550 °C for 4 h at a ramp rate of 5 °C min−1. After cooling to room temperature, the obtained bulk was milled to powder.24,27


Preparation of CD/OCN composites. 
CD/OCN was synthesized via a calcination process, where a certain quantity of OCN was dissolved in 15 ml of DI water and 5 ml of ethanol. Next, the as-prepared OCN solutions were added to a certain quantity of CDs, and heated at 65 °C under magnetic stirring. The resulting powders were placed in an alumina crucible with a lid and calcined at 300 °C under an ambient air atmosphere for 3 h at a ramping rate of 5 °C min−1. After cooling to room temperature, the resultant brown powder was collected through grinding using a mortar and pestle. Different CD/OCN powers with CD mass percentages of 0.0%, 0.1%, 0.2%, 0.3%, 0.4%, and 0.5% wt were prepared through the same procedure.

2.2 Characterization
The crystal structure of the as-prepared samples was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD, BRUKER D8 ADVANCE) under Cu K radiation. The microscopic morphologies of the samples were determined via a transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEM-2100HR). The recording of the FT-IR spectra (from 4000 to 400 cm−1) was conducted using a Thermofisher Nicolet 6700 spectrometer (Thermofisher, USA). A PHI Quantera 2X was used for X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis of the samples with non-monochromated Mg-Kα radiation, which served as the excitation source. Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area and porosity experiments were performed by N2 adsorption at −196 °C with an Autosorb-IQ (USA) instrument. A Shimadzu UV-2550 UV-vis spectrophotometer was employed to investigate the UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) of the samples at room temperature. The photoluminescence (PL) spectra and fluorescence lifetime were recorded via a transient steady-state fluorescence spectrometer (FS5, Edinburgh). The O2 temperature programmed desorption (O2-TPD) of the samples could be tested using an Automated Chemisorption Analyzer (ChemStar, USA). The photocurrent responses and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) spectra of the samples were recorded using a standard three-electrode cell with a CHI 760 electrochemical workstation (Shanghai, Chenhua).
2.3 Photocatalytic test
A 9 W LED lamp (UVEC-4 II, Shenzhen Lamplic Technology Company Ltd.), which emitted light primarily at 450 ± 5 nm, was used as a light source. Diclofenac (DCF) was used as a target drug for degradation. During the photocatalytic reaction, the reactor was magnetically stirred at a constant rate. The concentration of CD modified OCN was 0.4 g L−1, and the initial concentration of DCF was 4 mg L−1. Prior to light irradiation, the suspensions were initially sonicated for 30 min and then magnetically stirred in the dark for 30 min. At predetermined irradiation intervals, 1.00 mL of the reaction liquid was filtered using 0.22 um Millipore filters to remove the nanoparticles. The photocatalytic experiments were repeated, with the resulting mean values recorded in the analysis. The samples were further analyzed using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to determine the DCF concentration. Photocatalytic by-products were identified by HRLC-MS-MS (Thermo Scientific Ultimate 3000 RSLC and Q Exactive Orbitrap), with the details of the analytical methods found in the ESI.†
2.4 Detection of H2O2
The concentration of H2O2 was determined by utilizing a fluorescent reagent, as reported in previous work.24 Typically, the fluorescent reagent was prepared by mixing 1 mg of horseradish peroxidase and 2.7 mg of (p-hydroxyphenyl) acetic acid (POHPAA) in 10 mL (8.2 g L−1) of potassium hydrogen phthalate buffer solution (pH 4.01) with stirring. Following the photocatalytic test without DCF, the obtained 2 mL clear solution was added to 50 μL of the fluorescent reagent. After 10 min of reaction, 1 mL of 0.1 M NaOH solution was added. The product of the reaction between H2O2 and the fluorescent reagent with fluorescence emission at 409 nm was detected by PL (with excitation at 315 nm).
2.5 Theoretical calculations
Theoretical calculations were carried out using the Gaussian 09 program.37 Molecular orbital calculations were conducted via the B3LYP/6-311G (d,p) level, with the optimal conformation having a minimum energy. That is, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) for each DCF, g-C3N4 and OCN position were determined, after which the two-dimensional electron density color-filled maps were obtained using Multiwfn.38
3 Results and discussion
3.1 Characterization

Fig. 1a shows the TEM and size distribution of CDs, where the TEM image reveals the spherical morphology of the CDs. The average diameter of the CDs was ca. 3.5 nm (Fig. 1b). These CDs were successfully synthesized via a hydrothermal method and were similar to those from our previous research.32–34 As shown in Fig. 1c, the 2D lamellar structure of OCN was populated with irregular porous structures, which was due to the corrosion of the surface by HCl during heating of the precursor.39Fig. 1d depicts the attachment of the CDs onto the surface and interlayer of OCN. Fig. S1† shows the SEM images of g-C3N4, OCN, and CDs/OCN. As we can see, the bulk morphology of g-C3N4 would change to the OCN with porous morphology.

X-ray diffraction (XRD) was applied to elucidate the crystal structures of g-C3N4, OCN and CD/OCN, and the typical XRD patterns are shown in Fig. 2a. The XRD pattern of g-C3N4 revealed two distinct diffraction peaks at ∼13.2° and 27.5°, which were attributed to the approximate dimensions of heptazine units ((100) planes) and the periodic stacking of conjugated aromatic systems ((002) planes), respectively. As illustrated in Fig. 2a, a careful comparison of the diffraction peaks in the range of 25–30° revealed that the 002 planes shifted slightly toward a lower 2θ value. According to Bragg's law (eqn (1)), 2dhklsinθ = nλ, where d(hkl) is the distance between crystal planes of (hkl), θ is the diffraction angle of the crystal plane (hkl), and λ is the X-ray wavelength.34 The observed shift of the diffraction peak toward a lower angle might result in an increase of the d(hkl) value, which indicated that the oxygen species accounted for the enlarged gaps between the OCN layers. Moreover, the shift of the diffraction peak of CDs/OCN toward a higher angle than OCN might result in a decrease of the d(hkl) value, due to the introduction of the CDs.
 Fig. 2  XRD patterns (a) and UV-vis absorption spectra (b) of different samples. 
The optical properties of g-C3N4, OCN, and CD/OCN were investigated by UV-vis-Nir absorption spectroscopy. As shown in Fig. 2b, g-C3N4 exhibited a typical absorption edge at ∼460 nm, which was due to the transition of electrons from the N 2p to C 2p orbitals.40 Doping with oxygen atoms greatly extended the absorption edge of g-C3N4, from the visible light to near-infrared region, which was consistent with previous reports.27 Following the doping of CDs, the visible light absorption of CD/OCN was greater than that of OCN due to the excellent up-conversion properties of the CDs (Fig. S2†). Hence, the light absorption of g-C3N4 could be greatly reinforced via the CD doped OCN.
To further investigate changes in the chemical structures of g-C3N4, FTIR, Raman, and XPS spectra were obtained. The surface functionality of CDs was evaluated by FTIR spectra (Fig. S3†), which affirmed the presence of N–H, –OH, CN, CO, –NH, C–N, C–NH–C, and –C–O–C groups, as the peaks were centered at 3430 cm−1, 1647 cm−1, 1425 cm−1, 1380 cm−1, 1209 cm−1, 1108 cm−1, and 1043 cm−1, respectively.41–43 Thus, there were some various polar groups (e.g., hydroxyl, carbonyl, carboxyl, and epoxy) that were present on the surfaces of the CDs, which improved both the dissolvability and stability of the CDs, as well as further improved the electron donation and acceptance capacities of the CDs.
Generally, there were two kinds of active oxygen species: α and β on the surface of g-C3N4 and OCN. The α O species could be regarded as chemically adsorbed oxygen which has a lower desorption temperature (less than 350 °C). Meanwhile, the β O species has a higher desorption temperature (>350 °C, <750 °C), and is considered as partial crystal oxygen.44 As shown in Fig. S4,† the peak of chemically adsorbed O could be recorded in g-C3N4 and OCN. Carefully, the peak of crystal oxygen could be seen in OCN from 350 to 500 °C. These results could be confirmed by the following characterizations.
As shown in Fig. 3a, vibration peaks located at 1200–1650 cm−1 and 810 cm−1 were observed in the FT-IR spectra of g-C3N4, OCN, and CDs/OCN, which could be attributed to the aromatic CN heterocycles, stretching modes, and breathing vibrations of the triazine units, respectively.45–47 The OCN and CD/OCN peaks at 1240 cm−1 were assigned to the stretching vibration of the C–O–C groups.21,22 In addition, the C–OH, COOH, H2O, and N–H stretching vibrations were located at a wider band (∼3430 cm−1).14,45,48 The Raman spectra also revealed C–O–C stretching deformations at ∼1123 cm−1, ∼1152 cm−1, and ∼1250 cm−1 (Fig. 3b). The peaks were enhanced following the OCN doping of the CDs.
 Fig. 3  FT-IR (a) and Raman spectra (b) of the as-obtained samples. 
As depicted in Fig. 4, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed to survey the surface composition and chemical states of elements of the as-prepared OCN and CD/OCN photocatalysts. The XPS survey spectra of OCN and CD/OCN (Fig. 4a) revealed the existence of C, N, and O, and showed that the increased O and C contents were due to abundant –OH and –COOH groups on the surfaces of the CDs (Fig. S3†). The high-resolution XPS spectra of the C1s, N1s, and O1s of the samples are shown in Fig. 4. Fig. 4b shows the C1s XPS spectra of the OCN and CDs/OCN samples, and the peaks located at 288.17, 287.02, and 284.7 eV were assigned to NC–N, C–O, and C–C, respectively.49 Following the successful incorporation of CDs, the intensities of C–O and C–C were slightly enhanced. As shown in our previous study and in Fig. 4c, only two peaks were observed in the high-resolution XPS spectra of N 1s for OCN and CD/OCN.24 The peak at 400.27 eV was associated with an sp2-hybridized aromatic N, bound to C (CN–C), while the peak at a binding energy of 398.71 eV was attributed to tertiary nitrogen N–(C)3.50Fig. 4d reveals the XPS of OCN in the O 1s binding energy region, with peaks at 532.92 and 531.82 eV being assigned to the C–O–C and C–OH species.27 Correspondingly, in the O1s spectrum of the CD/OCN sample, the peak of N–CN shifted by 0.15 eV toward a lower binding energy. The peak at 531.82 eV was ascribed to C–OH, which increased from 60.11% to 68.92% due to the significant introduction of CD resident hydroxyl groups. Thus, on the one hand, these results showed that O replaced N in the C–N–C position, which linked the two heptazines in g-C3N4via semicarbazide hydrochloride as the precursor. On the other hand, the CDs could be linked by OCN to form the C–O–C bond, and the oxygen content increased further through the introduction of CDs into OCN.

To further show the role of oxygen atoms, the two-dimensional valence-electron density color-filled maps of g-C3N4 and OCN have been obtained by DFT and the results were also analyzed by Multiwfn.38 Obviously, the electrons of C atoms were found to be more inclined to flow toward the O atom, resulting in the O atom having a more negative charge and the nearby C atom a lower electron density (Fig. 5a and b). The modulated electronic structure of OCN was attributed to the formation of unpaired electrons and the promotion of electron transfer.51Fig. 5c shows the electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra of g-C3N4, OCN and CD/OCN. All the samples displayed a single Lorentzian line whose g value was 2.003. The signals were derived from the unpaired electrons of the atoms in the aromatic rings within πbonded clusters, which were beneficial to the enhancement of the mobility of charge carriers.46,48 With the introduction of minute amounts of CDs into OCN, the πconjugated system was slightly strengthened due to the formation of an OCN/carbon heterostructure at the interface, and linked with the C–O–C bond. This revealed that a higher concentration of unpaired electrons was significantly beneficial for the photogeneration of active radical pairs for catalytic reactions, which translated to higher photocatalytic activity.

3.2 Photoelectric catalyst properties
To assess the photoelectric properties of the catalysts, the steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra, time-resolved fluorescence spectra, transient photocurrent responses, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) spectra were obtained. As depicted in Fig. 6a and b, a higher photocurrent was recorded, and a distinctly decreased hemicycle radius was shown in CD/OCN, which indicated that the separation efficiency of photogenerated charge carriers was effectively improved. Moreover, OCN and CD/OCN demonstrated obvious fluorescence quenching, in contrast to pure g-C3N4, which meant that OCN and CD/OCN had a higher separation efficiency of photogenerated electron–hole pairs due to C–O–C bonds (Fig. 6c).52 CD/OCN exhibited weak fluorescence, which indicated that the electrons could be transferred by the CDs. Time-resolved fluorescence spectra were monitored at the corresponding emission peaks to give the average radiative lifetimes (At) of the recombining photogenerated electron–hole pairs (Fig. 6d). The At of g-C3N4, OCN, and CDs/OCN were 4.832, 2.574, and 2.200 ns, respectively. In addition, the apparent electron-transfer (ET) rate (kET) in OCN, and CD/OCN was calculated by the following equation (eqn (1) and (2)):53 (1) (2)
 Fig. 6  The photocurrent responses (a), electrochemical impedance spectra (b), PL spectra (c), and fluorescence decay (d) of g-C3N4, OCN and CDs/OCN. 
The calculated value was 1.8 × 108 s−1 > 0 and 6.6 × 107 s−1 > 0 for OCN, and CD/OCN respectively, which showed that the oxygen and nitrogen-linked heptazine-based polymer could promote the separation efficiency of charge carriers. The recombination of electron–hole pairs might be more effectively inhibited on CDs/OCN.54,55 These results indicated an easier charge transport of the material and a higher photocatalysis activity than those of g-C3N4 and OCN, which was due to the increased O content and stronger charge transport properties of the CDs.
3.3 Photocatalytic activity
The as-prepared CD/OCN was employed for the photocatalytic removal of DCF under blue light irradiation (450 ± 5 nm) to investigate the effects of the heterojunction between the CDs and OCN on catalytic efficacy. Fig. 7a shows the relative change of DCF concentration (C/C0) as a function of irradiation time tested over the different catalysts. For the control, the removal of DCF was negligible under the same visible light irradiation for 60 min, which indicated the high photostability of DCF to blue light. Obviously, OCN demonstrated an enhanced performance for the degradation of DCF over g-C3N4, due to the highly effective and stable oxygen- and nitrogen-linked structures that existed in OCN.24 With the introduction of CDs, the DCF degradation rate was distinctly faster than that for pure OCN and g-C3N4, which meant that the CDs could enhance the photocatalytic activities of OCN due to their excellent up-conversion properties (Fig. S1†). As shown in Fig. 7b, it was obviously demonstrated that the degradation rate of 0.2 wt% CD/OCN was 11.7 and 2.33 times higher than that of g-C3N4 and OCN, respectively, under blue light irradiation.

To assess whether the CD/OCN composites might be used for the degradation of DCF under different light irradiation, the degradation of DCF was carried out under visible light, UV light, and simulated sunlight irradiation. As depicted in Fig. 7c, CD/OCN exhibited superior photocatalytic performance under all four light sources, which revealed that the photocatalytic activity of OCN was 2.37, 1.83, 5.56, and 3.94 times higher than that of g-C3N4 under visible light, simulated sunlight, blue light, and UV light irradiation, respectively. Moreover, the photocatalytic properties of 0.2 wt% CD/OCN were 1.64, 1.42, 2.29, and 1.23 times higher than those of OCN, respectively. These results indicated that the combination of CDs with OCN could yield responsive broad-spectrum photocatalysts. As shown in Fig. 7a, an excess of CDs (>0.2 wt%) would lead to an obvious decrease of photocatalytic activity. A similar phenomenon of the CD composite has been reported in many articles.32,34,56 Higher CD content within the composites could lead to an inner filter effect, which occurs via competition with OCN for the absorption of photons.34,56
Moreover, the photocatalytic generation of H2O2 in pure water under visible light irradiation and an ambient atmosphere was also conducted to evaluate the photocatalytic activities. As shown in Fig. 7d, H2O2 was generated in g-C3N4, OCN, and CDs/OCN blue light systems. The H2O2 production in the g-C3N4 suspension slowly increased under blue light irradiation, which was similar to previous results.57 Comparably, OCN was shown to be more active for H2O2 production due to the C–O–C bond.24,27 Obviously, the yield of produced H2O2 over CD/OCN under the same visible light irradiation was much higher than that over g-C3N4 and OCN. These results signified that CD/OCN had excellent photocatalytic activities. Therefore, ESR and quenching experiments were applied to obtain insights into the photocatalytic mechanism of CD/OCN.
In general, during the procedure of the photocatalytic degradation of DCF over CDs/OCN, a variety of reactive species (RS) may be generated and perform different roles. Thus, different scavengers were employed to further identify their role in the degradation of DCF under blue light irradiation. Typically, isopropanol (IPA, ˙OH scavenger), 4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidinyloxy (Tempol, O2˙− scavenger), and sodium oxalate (Na2C2O4, h+ scavenger) were used.32 As displayed in Fig. 8d, on the one hand, with addition of IPA and Na2C2O4, the degradation of DCF has shown some changes with 44% and 40% contribution, respectively. On the other hand, DCF almost could not be degraded by CDs/OCN with the addition of Tempol. Hence, it is indicated that O2˙− displayed a significant role in the photocatalytic degradation of DCF.

To further investigate the photocatalytic properties of CD/OCN in the photodegradation of PPCPs, ESR was applied for the detection of reactive species. As depicted in Fig. 8a and b, no ESR signal was observed under dark conditions. Notably, strong DMPO-O2˙− and DMPO-˙OH signals were detected by four-line ESR signals, with intensity ratios of 1:1:1:1 and 1:2:2:1, which meant that many ˙OH and O2˙− were present in the photocatalytic process by CD/OCN during visible-light irradiation. Moreover, TEMP-1O2 adducts were observed under visible light irradiation (Fig. 8c), which indicated the generation of 1O2 in the process of photocatalytic molecular oxygen activation.58 Further, all CDs/OCN signals were distinctly stronger than those of OCN, which revealed that additional RS could be produced following the introduction of CDs. Based on the results shown in Fig. 7b, the DCF degradation rate was higher in the presence of the CD/OCN composites than that of OCN. This implied that the higher production of ˙OH, O2˙−, and 1O2 gave rise to an increased DCF degradation rate. These results showed that CD/OCN was more conducive to the removal of organic pollutants.
To investigate the DCF degradation kinetics, HRAM LC-MS/MS was applied to identify the by-products formed, and the frontier electron density was utilized to predict the degradation positions. The by-product information is summarized in Fig. S5 and S6.† As revealed in Fig. 9, eleven products were identified via HRAM LC-MS/MS; the HOMO and LUMO of DCF indicate that the electrons flow from the HOMO to LUMO locations, and these positions are also vulnerable to attack by the RS, especially the N position. The products with m/z values of 277.18048 and 313.23792 were easily formed via the nucleophilic reaction and similar results were reported by Chen.59 Further, DCF formed products with an m/z value of 281.00146 throughout decarboxylation by O2˙−via nucleophilic reactions.60 As reported in our previous studies, N (11) and C (2) would be easily attacked by ˙OH via electrophilic reactions.59 Subsequently, products with m/z values of 152.03415, 167.97389, 135.89352, and 163.96564 were detected by HRAM LC-MS/MS. Meanwhile the detection of products with m/z values of 128.00896, 144.92230, and 141.01822 verified that Cl was freed by dechlorination, which was similar to the degradation of diclofenac by pyrite catalyzed Fenton oxidation.61 Further, ring cleavage products were found to further oxidize CO2 and H2O through ROS. These results confirmed that under visible light irradiation, CD/OCN exhibited robust activity for the photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants.

3.4 Photocatalyst mechanism
To further elucidate the catalytic mechanism, the bandgaps of the as-prepared samples were determined by Mott–Schottky plots and the Kubelka–Munk formula (Fig. S7 and S8†). As depicted in Fig. S9,† the bandgap was narrowed from 2.74 eV for g-C3N4 to 2.10 eV for OCN, which was due to the replacement of N with O in the linked heptazine position.24 The bandgap narrowing was further verified through an increase in the utilization of visible light. Moreover, the relative conduction band minimum (CBM) of OCN was −0.36 eV.24 Identical results were also confirmed by DFT calculations of the g-C3N4 and OCN unit models (Fig. S10†). It is important to note that the narrowed bandgap of OCN, as the result of CBM shifts, still satisfied the thermodynamic requirements for the formation of O2˙− radicals from O2. However, the position of the VB (1.74 eV) could not oxidize OH− to ˙OH(E(˙OH/OH−) = 1.99 eV).32 As was confirmed by ESR, more ˙OH were found over CD/OCN. To further investigate the production of ROS, Raman spectra were obtained. As revealed in Fig. S11,† following the photoreaction, a new band appeared at 873 cm−1 in the illuminated OCN, which corresponded to O–O vibrations in the hydroperoxide groups (OOH).62 Moreover, the O2˙− radicals would react with h+ and form 1O2.63 Therefore, from the comparative investigations above, the photocatalytic removal of DCF over CD/OCN may have proceeded as follows (eqn (3)–(8) and Fig. 10): CDs/OCN + light → h+ + e−(3) O2 + e− (CDs) → O2˙−(4) O2 + 2H+ + 2e− (OCN) → H2O2(5) H2O2 + e− → ˙OH + OH−(6) O2˙− + h+ → 1O2(7) PPCPs + RSs → products(8)
 Fig. 10  Proposed mechanism for DCF degradation by visible-light-activated CDs/OCN. 
As shown in Fig. S10,† the electronic transitions of all the OCN models were primarily contributed by HOMO → LUMO transitions.62 The LUMO electrons were located at the 1,3,4,5-positions of the heptazine, which meant that the CB electrons localized on these atoms and served as the sites for the two-electron reduction of O2. The electrons on the HOMO for the OCN unit models were located at the 2,6-positions of the melem unit, which suggested that the 2,6-positions of the nitrogen atoms serve as the oxidation sites.62 Thus, subsequent to photoexcitation, the e− would be stimulated from the N 2p to C 2p orbitals and then localized at the C1, C3, N4, and C5 positions of the melem unit, whereas the h+ were at the N positions (Fig. S12†).40 The e− on either C position reduced O2, to produce a superoxo radical, whereas the h+ oxidized water.62 The generation of 1,4-endoperoxide species was detected by Raman spectroscopy at 873 cm−1 (Fig. S11†), and the protonation of the species produced H2O2.62 As shown in Fig. 7d, additional H2O2 were generated by CD/OCN under identical irradiation in contrast to OCN, which was due to O2 not being easily reduced by 4-electron reduction to form H2O (O2 + 4H+ + 4e− → 2H2O). Moreover, ESR confirmed that more O2˙− radicals were formed in CD/OCN, while higher charge carrier separation efficiencies were confirmed by the above experiments. Hence, following the introduction of CDs (Fig. 10), the additional e− would be transferred to the CDs, and H2O2 could be more easily produced by proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) via the reduction of O2 (O2 + 2H+ + 2e− → H2O2; E0 = 0.695VNHE).8,14–17 The additional O2 were also reduced to form O2˙− radicals on the CDs. Finally, H2O2 were catalyzed to form ˙OH radicals by the higher concentration of unpaired electrons on CDs/OCN (Fig. 5), and DCF would be attacked by the reactive species (RS).
4 Conclusions
In summary, we successfully constructed a broad spectrum photocatalytic CDs/OCN composite via a simple process. As tested for photocatalytic degradation of DCF under visible light, the CDs/OCN composite showed significant enhancement in catalytic activity in comparison to OCN. The robust activity of efficient charge separation led to enhanced photocatalytic production of O2˙−, H2O2 and ˙OH. Since O2˙− and H2O2 can be formed at different locations, their yields have been significantly improved on CDs/OCN. This study provides a simple way to design effective photocatalysts for the degradation of organic pollutants that can respond to broad spectrum light, facilitating the utilization and storage of solar energy.

Environmental significance
Water environment issues have become a huge challenge for us. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), which is a well-known antiseptic, serves as one of the crucial oxidants in traditional advanced oxidation processes (AOPs), and is widely employed in environmental remediation. Additionally, the efficiency of the synthesis of H2O2 was limited by the four-electron reduction of O2 (water formation) and the one-electron reduction of O2 (O2˙−). However, O2˙− also played a significant role in the photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants. In this paper, we report on metal-free co-catalysts with the in situ incorporation of carbon dots (CDs) into a polymeric O and N co-linked carbon nitride (OCN) framework, which significantly enhanced the artificial photosynthesis of H2O2 and O2˙− due to dual reactive sites. This study clearly demonstrates a simple strategy for the design and synthesis of metal-free materials in the preparation of H2O2 and O2˙− toward the degradation of organic pollutants.
