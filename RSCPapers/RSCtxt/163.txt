    , Accepted 18th September 2019First published on 10th October 2019AbstractThe combination of π-conjugated organic compounds and Pt(II)-acetylides is a powerful strategy for the production of functional optoelectronic materials. The presence of the heavy element, Pt, in these compounds enhances electronic delocalization generally resulting in low-energy absorption and emission maxima and often leads to intersystem crossing, resulting in phosphorescence. When boron complexes of N-donor ligands, such as boron dipyrromethenes (BODIPYs), are involved the molecular and polymeric materials produced have properties that are advantageous for their use as oxygen-sensors, in triplet–triplet annihilation, and as the functional components of photovoltaics. Based on these exciting results, we endeavored to thoroughly examine the effect of Pt(II)-acetylide conjugation on the properties of BF2 formazanate dyes, which offer improved redox properties and red-shifted absorption and emission bands compared to many structurally related BODIPYs. The results showed that phosphine-supported Pt(II)-acetylide incorporation enhanced electronic conjugation, rendering the electrochemical reduction of the BF2 formazanate dyes more difficult, while also red-shifting their absorption and emission maxima. Unlike similar BODIPYs, the presence of Pt(II) did not facilitate phosphorescence, but rather quenched fluorescence. This study provides significant insights into structure–property relationships and guiding principles for the design of BF2 formazanate dyes, a rapidly emerging family of readily accessible optoelectronic materials.
Introduction
Molecular and polymeric materials that contain both Pt(II)-acetylide (PA) and π-conjugated building blocks have found applications as, for example, the active components of light emitting devices1 and photovoltaics2 and in triplet–triplet annihilation upconversion.3 Much of the early work in this area focused on the understanding of excited state dynamics and energy transfer between Pt(II) and the π-conjugated organics employed in a variety of dye platforms.4 The presence of Pt(II) in these systems enhances spin–orbit coupling and often enables intersystem crossing from the excited singlet to triplet states. As a result, this class of materials often exhibit both fluorescence and phosphorescence bands.5
Boron adducts of chelating N-donor ligands are a well-studied class of dyes with unique and useful properties, including high molar absorptivities and emission quantum yields that can be tuned through structural variation.3a,c,6 For example, Zhao and co-workers have recently prepared complex I by directly conjugating boron dipyrromethene (BODIPY) with Pt(N^C^N) complexes using acetylide linkers to maximize the heavy-atom effect.6a It was shown that this structural modification facilitated intersystem crossing, leading to long-lived room temperature phosphorescence.6a Complex I was also used as an efficient photosensitizer for triplet–triplet annihilation upconversion.6a More recently, the Winter group has prepared complex II by oxidative addition of a bromine-substituted BODIPY to a reactive Pt(0) species and observed dual fluorescence and phosphorescence emission from the excited S1 and T1 states of the BODIPY dye.6f Upon metalation, a decrease in fluorescence quantum yield (ΦF) was observed, while the phosphorescence quantum yield increased to 31% at room temperature.6f PA units have also been used to extend the π-conjugation of polymers containing BF2 complexes of N-donor ligands. For example, BODIPY polymer III has a low band gap of 1.7 eV and gave rise to power conversion efficiencies close to 1% when incorporated into bulk heterojunction solar cells.7 BF2 formazanate polymer IV showed promise as an n-type semiconductor where every repeating unit was addressable via chemical reduction and the presence of PA units dramatically reduced the band gap to ca. 1.4 eV, making it an excellent candidate for use in light-harvesting applications.8
The main group chemistry of formazanate ligands has been led primarily by the Gilroy and Otten groups,9 including the chemistry of BF2 formazanate dyes (V) where Ar1 and Ar5 are typically aromatic substituents and R3 can be varied to include aromatic, heterocyclic, cyano, nitro, and alkyl groups.9e,10 These dyes have rich optical and electrochemical properties that are sensitive to the nature of their substituents9e,10 and have found applications as fluorescence cell imaging agents,10h,11 efficient aggregation-induced emission luminogens,12 multifunctional polymers,8,13 near-infrared emitters (VI),14 and as precursors to a variety of unusual boron–nitrogen heterocycles.10a,d,15 BF2 complexes of triarylformazanate ligands are known to be weakly fluorescent due to efficient non-radiative relaxation pathways associated with rotation and/or vibration of the 3-aryl substituents.10b,f,g However, we have previously reported that protonation of the otherwise non-emissive pyridine-functionalized BF2 formazanate VII resulted in a significant increase in ΦF up to a maximum of 18%.16 More recently, we have demonstrated that conversion of the BF2 moiety to an oxoborane (BO) group in VIII also turns on fluorescence, up to a ΦF value of 36%.17

  Transition metal coordination complexes of formazanates have also been investigated for several decades.18 Otten and co-workers explored the redox chemistry of Zn(II) formazanate complexes and demonstrated that the formazanate ligand can act as an electron reservoir upon chemical reduction.10a,18c,d They also prepared pseudo-tetrahedral bis-formazanate Fe(II) complex IX and observed thermal switching between low spin (S = 0) and high spin (S = 2) states.18h The Teets group has extensively explored the properties of a series of non-emissive heteroleptic cyclometalated platinum (X) and iridium complexes of formazanate ligands that can be electrochemically reduced by up to three electrons.18g,l,p The formazanate-based reduction potentials of these non-emissive complexes were readily tuned by varying the electron donating/withdrawing substituents at R1, R3 and R5 positions.18g,l,p
Given the successful alteration of the optoelectronic properties of molecular and polymeric materials comprised of BF2 complexes of N-donor ligands and PAs, we now explore the effect of peripheral decoration of BF2 formazanate dyes with PAs. Based on the previously described sensitivity of the properties derived from formazanate ligands to their structure and the identity of the inorganic element to which the ligands are coordinated, we believe that this subclass of materials is ideally suited for such a study.  
Results and discussion
Synthesis
BF2 formazanate dyes 1a/1b and 2a/2b were prepared according to reported procedures.10h,13 The reaction of mono-alkyne substituted BF2 formazanates 1a/1b with trans-[PtCl(PBu3)2(CCPh)] in the presence of catalytic CuI for 2 h resulted in the formation of asymmetric Pt-complexes 3a8/3b in 79% and 46% yield, respectively (Scheme 1a and Fig. S1–S3†). The PBu3 ancillary ligands were chosen as they provide stability and enhance solubility. These transformations were accompanied by colour changes from dark purple to dark blue and the disappearance of the alkyne proton resonance at ∼3.3 ppm in the corresponding 1H NMR spectra. Symmetric Pt(II)-complexes 4a8/4b were prepared via similar reactions of 1a/1b with trans-[Pt(PBu3)2Cl2] in 87% and 78% yield, respectively (Scheme 1b and Fig. S4–S6†). The reaction of bis-alkyne substituted BF2 formazanates 2a/2b with trans-[PtCl(PBu3)2(CCPh)] in the presence of catalytic CuI for 5 h resulted in the formation of symmetric Pt-complexes 5a/5b in 46% and 42% yield (Scheme 1c and Fig. S7–S12†). The structure and purity of these complexes were confirmed by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy, IR and UV-vis absorption spectroscopy, and high-resolution mass spectrometry. It should be noted that the methoxy groups at the N-aryl substituents and the cyano groups at R3 were specifically introduced in compounds 1b–5b in an attempt to maximize their emission intensities.10b,c,f

X-ray crystallography
The solid-state structure of compound 4a has been reported.8 Single crystals of compound 4b suitable for X-ray diffraction studies were grown by vapour diffusion of hexanes into a saturated solution in toluene (Fig. 1). The average Pt–P [4a: 2.3026(7) Å; 4b: 2.3074(6) Å], Pt–C [4a: 1.9924(14) Å; 4b: 1.9941(14) Å], and CC [4a: 1.2170(19) Å; 4b: 1.2212(19) Å] bond lengths are similar to those of other PA complexes.19 The C–N [4a: 1.3456(17); 4b: 1.3403(17)] and N–N [4a: 1.3129(17); 4b: 1.3016(16)] bond lengths associated with the BF2 formazanate heterocycle are between those of typical single and double bonds for the atoms involved,20 which indicates a high degree of electronic delocalization within the formazanate ligand backbone. The boron centre in each complex has a tetrahedral geometry and is displaced from the N1–N2–N3–N4 plane by 0.63 Å in complex 4a and by an average of 0.060 Å in complex 4b. The dihedral angles between the planes defined by the N-aryl substituents and the formazanate backbone are offset by 46.4° and 50.4° in complex 4a and by an average of 13.3° and 22.3° in complex 4b. Taken together, these metrics demonstrate that the structure of 4b appears to have a greater degree of planarity in the solid state compared to that of 4a.

Selected bond angles (°): P1–Pt1–P1′ 177.49(11); Pt1–C17–C16 174.90(12); C17–C16–C13 170.32(15); N3–N4–C1 117.55(12); N4–C1–N2 129.43(13); N1–N2–C1 117.34(12); N3–B1–N1 106.57(11); F1–B1–F2 111.18(12). 
Cyclic voltammetry
Cyclic voltammograms of complexes 1–5(a/b) collected in CH2Cl2 are shown in Fig. 2 and the data are summarized in Table 1. The cyclic voltammetry data collected for these series of compounds reveal several features: (i) the BF2 formazanate complexes are electrochemically reduced to their corresponding radical anion (Ered1 −0.78 to −1.00 V relative to ferrocene/ferrocenium for 1a–5a and −0.50 to −0.78 V for 1b–5b) and dianion (Ered2 −1.73 to −1.94 V for 1a–5a and −1.58 to −1.80 V for 1b–5b) forms (Scheme 2). The current response in all cases corresponds to a one electron change per BF2 formazanate unit. (ii) Analogous compounds of series 1a–5a (R3 = Ph) are harder to reduce than those of series 1b–5b (R3 = CN) owing to the increased electron-withdrawing character of the cyano group relative to the phenyl substituent. A direct comparison of compounds 2a/2b and 5a/5b reveals that Ered1 is shifted to positive potentials by ca. 0.25 V and Ered2 is shifted by ca. 0.2 V when R3 is changed from Ph to CN. (iii) When electron-rich PA units are conjugated to BF2 formazanates, the formazanate-based reduction waves observed are shifted by 0.1 to 0.2 V to more negative potentials. The precise magnitude of the shift appears to be a complex balance between the size of the relevant π-electron system and the electron-donating/withdrawing nature of the groups directly appended to the N-aryl substituents of the formazanate ligand. (iv) The introduction of [Pt(PBu3)2]2+ units is accompanied by the appearance of irreversible oxidation waves (Eox1 0.63 to 0.77 V and Eox2 0.85 to 1.02 V for 3a–5a and Eox1 0.80 to 0.88 V and Eox2 1.21 to 1.22 V for 3b–5b) corresponding to the oxidation of Pt(II) to Pt(IV).4d,h

UV-vis absorption and emission spectroscopy
The absorption and emission data for the parent BF2 formazanate dyes (1a/2a and 1b/2b) are typical of this class of compounds,10b,c,f and we note that there is little profile change in the absorption bands with maxima (λmax) of ca. 540 nm and that the resultant emission bands centred at ca. 650 nm have similar profiles of a strong peak at high energy followed by vibronic bands that extend towards 800 nm (Fig. 3 and Table 2). The Stokes shifts (υST) observed for 1a/2a and 1b/2b are consistent with those observed for related analogues, as are the enhanced ΦF values when R3 = CN.10b,c,f The apparent Stokes shifts and qualitative mismatch between the shapes of the low-energy absorption and emission maxima in these systems arise due to structural reorganization upon excitation. Recently, the modestly bent ground state configuration of BF2 formazanates has been shown to rearrange to a short-lived excited state with an extremely bent geometry upon excitation. This non-emissive state ultimately relaxes to a planar, emissive excited state from which radiative decay is observed.10l

The properties change significantly when [Pt(PBu3)2]2+ units are introduced. Fig. 3a and b show the absorption and emission spectra of compounds 1a–5a (R3 = Ph). These compounds are strongly absorbing with low-energy λmax between 526 and 638 nm and molar absorptivities (ε) between 20000 and 77400 M−1 cm−1, which were red-shifted compared to structurally related BODIPYs (e.g., complex I).6a,c The extinction coefficient for compound 4a is significantly enhanced relative to the other compounds reported in this series due to the presence of two BF2 formazanates per molecule. There are two logical comparisons to be made for this series of compounds: compounds 1a/3a/4a and 2a/5a. Comparison of the properties of compounds 1a and 3a, which differ by the introduction of a single [Pt(PBu3)2]2+ unit, revealed a red-shift in the lowest-energy absorption maxima of approximately 62 nm. Further comparison of the spectra of 1a and 4a, the latter being comprised of two BF2 formazanate dyes bridged by a PA unit, revealed a greater red-shift of 72 nm. Given that the bridged compound 4a has the lowest-energy absorption maximum, it can be concluded that electronic conjugation extends through an interaction involving the 6d orbitals at platinum and the alkynyl π* orbitals, as has been well-established in the literature.5,21 The low-energy absorption maximum of compound 5a is red-shifted by 97 nm compared to that of 2a, further demonstrating the dramatic influence of the PA units on the low-energy absorption of BF2 formazanate dyes. As noted previously, BF2 formazanate dyes bearing aryl substituents at the R3 position are often weakly emissive due to the dominance of non-radiative decay pathways associated with vibration and/or rotation.10b,f,g This trend held for compounds 1a–5a, which exhibited fluorescence bands with maxima (λF) between 648 and 810 nm and ΦF values <2%. The quantum yields decreased upon the introduction of [Pt(PBu3)2]2+ units, indicating that intersystem crossing may be operative. The lifetimes associated with the emission spectra recorded were shorter than 3 μs, which combined with the lack of spectral variability upon the introduction of O2 and the υST data obtained (υST: 122–188 nm, 3328–4120 cm−1) allowed us to conclude that the dominant emission mechanism is fluorescence. No signs of phosphorescence bands were observed, even when solutions were frozen at 77 K.
The trends in absorption and emission data recorded for compounds 1b–5b (R3 = CN, λmax: 530–701 nm, ε: 30400–78000 M−1 cm−1, λem: 635–792 nm, ΦF: 1–30%, emission lifetimes <3 μs; Fig. 3c–e and Table 2) are qualitatively similar to those discussed above, with observed absorption/emission bands red-shifted relative to those of 1a–5a. BF2 formazanates with cyano substituents at the R3 position are perhaps better suited for the study of emission properties as they exhibit ΦF values up to 77% in solution.10c The methoxy groups present in 1b, 3b, and 4b have been specifically introduced due to their tendency to enhance emission intensity in related systems.10b,c Consistent with previous reports, compounds 1b and 2b give rise to fluorescence bands centred at 647 and 635 nm and ΦF values of 30 and 18%, respectively. The introduction of the [Pt(PBu3)2]2+ units once again dramatically red-shifted these bands and also resulted in significant quenching of the fluorescence intensity (ΦF < 1%), indicating that any intersystem crossing taking place in these systems is also accompanied by an, as of yet, unknown mechanism of efficient non-radiative decay. In all cases, no signs of phosphorescence were observed at room temperature or when solutions were frozen at 77 K. This behavior is in contrast to many examples of dyes based on BODIPY units conjugated with PAs (e.g., complexes I and II) where dual emission6f (i.e., fluorescence and phosphorescence) or pure phosphorescence6a is observed.
Conclusions
In this work we studied two series of complexes formed by conjugating BF2 formazanate dyes and PA units that differed in their R3 substituents (R3 = Ph or CN) with the goal of assessing the influence of PAs on the optoelectronic properties of BF2 formazanates. In general, complexes bearing R3 = Ph substituents (1a–5a) were harder to electrochemically reduce and had blue-shifted absorption maxima compared to those bearing R3 = CN substituents (1b–5b). Trends in emission maxima were not as straightforward as Stokes shifts and emission intensity varied widely and all compounds other than 1b and 2b exhibited weak fluorescence.
The introduction of phosphine-supported Pt(II) ions had a dramatic effect on the optoelectronic properties of the BF2 formazanate dyes reported. In all cases, the introduction of the electron-rich [Pt(PBu3)2]2+ units at the periphery of the formazanate framework resulted in more negative reduction potentials associated with formazanate-based radical anion and dianion formation. Furthermore, waves attributed to the oxidation of Pt(II) appeared in the cyclic voltammograms. The effect of Pt(II) on the absorption bands of these series of compounds is to red-shift and intensify to varying extents depending on the overall size of the π-electron system, with 5a and 5b exhibiting maxima at 638 nm and 701 nm, respectively. Examination of the absorption properties of dimers 4a and 5a, bridged by PAs, allowed for the conclusion that electronic delocalization occurs through the Pt(II) centre. In the case of the emission spectra, the major influence of Pt(II) is observed in the red-shifted and very weak emission spectra observed at both room temperature and 77 K, which indicates that an intersystem crossing mechanism may be taking place. However, no signs of phosphorescence were observed.
Taken together, these results demonstrate that the conjugation of PAs at the periphery of the BF2 formazanate dyes has a dramatic influence on their properties and significantly enhances the understanding of structure–property relationships in formazanate-based optoelectronic materials.
Experimental
General considerations
Reactions and manipulations were carried out under an N2 atmosphere using standard Schlenk techniques unless otherwise stated. Solvents were obtained from Caledon Laboratories, dried using an Innovative Technologies Inc. solvent purification system, collected under vacuum and stored under a nitrogen atmosphere over 4 Å molecular sieves. Reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich or Alfa Aesar and used as received. K2PtCl4 was purchased from Precious Metals Online and used as received. Alkyne-functionalized BF2 formazanates 1a,b and 2a,b,10h,13 platinum complexes 3a and 4a,8trans-[Pt(PBu3)2Cl2],23 and trans-[PtCl(PBu3)2(CCPh)]24 were prepared according to literature procedures.
NMR spectra were recorded on 400 MHz (1H: 399.8 MHz, 13C{1H}: 100.6 MHz, 11B: 128.3 MHz, 19F{1H}: 376.1 MHz, 31P{1H}: 161.8 MHz) Bruker and 600 MHz (1H: 599.5 MHz, 13C{1H}: 150.7 MHz) Varian INOVA instruments. 1H NMR spectra were referenced to residual CHDCl2 (5.32 ppm) and 13C{1H} NMR spectra were referenced to CD2Cl2 (53.8 ppm). 11B NMR spectra were referenced to BF3·OEt2 (0 ppm), 19F NMR spectra were referenced to CFCl3 (0 ppm), and 31P{1H} NMR spectra were referenced to H3PO4 (0 ppm). Mass spectra were recorded in positive-ion mode using a high-resolution Thermo Scientific DFS (Double Focusing Sector) mass spectrometer using electron impact ionization. FT-IR spectra were recorded on a PerkinElmer Spectrum Two instrument using an attenuated total reflectance accessory. UV-vis absorption spectra were recorded using a Cary 5000 instrument between 200 and 2000 nm. Four separate concentrations were run for each sample and molar extinction coefficients were determined from the slope of a plot of absorbance against concentration.
Emission data were measured using a Photon Technology Quanta Master (QM4/2003) scanning spectrofluorometer (PTI Inc., London, Canada). The compounds were excited using a xenon flash lamp. The lamp was flashed at a frequency of 100 Hz and 20 shots were averaged per nm step. The emission spectra were measured between 550 and 1000 nm. Excitation and emission slit widths were kept constant for all measurements at 10 nm and 5 nm, respectively. Data were collected from 0 μs to 200 μs after the initial exciting pulse of light. The wavelength was scanned at a step size of 1 nm. Each spectrum was the average of 5 scans. The [Ru(bpy)3][PF6]2 standard was measured using the same parameters. The emission spectrum of the standard was obtained by exciting the sample at 450 nm. Each sample was excited at wavelengths associated with the excitation spectrum maximum, which was different from the absorption spectrum maximum: 527 nm for 1a; 552 nm for 1b; 544 nm for 2a; 532 nm for 2b; 566 nm for 3a; 494 nm for 3b; 485 nm for 4a; 485 nm for 4b; 532 nm for 5a; and 494 nm for 5b.
X-ray crystallography methods
A crystal of 4b was mounted on a MiTeGen polyimide micromount with a small amount of Paratone N oil. X-ray diffraction measurements were made on a Bruker Kappa Axis Apex2 diffractometer at a temperature of 110 K. The data collection strategy involved a number of ω and φ scans which allowed for data acquisition over a range of angles, 2θ. The frame integration was performed using SAINT.25 The resulting raw data were scaled and absorption corrected using a multi-scan averaging of symmetry equivalent data using SADABS.26 The structure was solved by using a dual space methodology using the SHELXT program.27 All non-hydrogen atoms were obtained from the initial solution. The hydrogen atoms were introduced at idealized positions and were allowed to ride on the parent atom. The structural model was fit to the data using full matrix least-squares based on F2. The calculated structural factors included corrections for anomalous dispersion from the usual tabulation. The structure was refined using the SHELXL-2014 program from the SHELX suite of crystallographic software.28 See Table 3 and CCDC 1946960 for additional crystallographic data.†

Electrochemical methods
Cyclic voltammetry experiments were performed with a Bioanalytical Systems Inc. (BASi) Epsilon potentiostat and analyzed using BASi Epsilon software. Electrochemical cells consisted of a three-electrode setup including a glassy carbon working electrode, a platinum wire counter electrode, and a silver wire pseudo reference electrode. Experiments were run at scan rates of 250 mV s−1 in degassed CH2Cl2 solutions of the analyte (∼1 mM) and the supporting electrolyte (0.1 M [nBu4N][PF6]). Cyclic voltammograms were referenced against an internal standard (∼1 mM ferrocene) and corrected for internal cell resistance using the BASi Epsilon software.
Synthetic procedures

Asymmetric Pt complex 3b. 
A mixture of trans-[PtCl(PBu3)2(CCPh)] (0.170 g, 0.231 mmol) and mono-alkyne substituted BF2 formazanate dye 1b (0.081 g, 0.23 mmol) was dissolved in a mixture of dry, degassed CH2Cl2 (5 mL) and HN(i-Pr)2 (5 mL) before CuI (0.004 g, 0.02 mmol) was added. The mixture was then stirred for 2 h at 21 °C. The solvents were removed in vacuo from the dark blue-purple solution, and the resulting solid was purified by column chromatography (toluene, 1.5′′ × 8′′ silica gel, Rf = 0.71) to obtain complex 3b as a greasy dark blue-purple solid.
