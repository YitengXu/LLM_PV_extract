    , Accepted 8th June 2018First published on 12th June 2018AbstractIn this study, we report noticeable photoelectrochemical water oxidation on single-crystalline PbCrO4 microrods. Microrods are directly formed on fluorine-doped tin oxide via electrodeposition based on the electrochemical oxidation of Cr3+ to Cr6+ in the presence of Pb2+ in the electrolyte. The as-deposited PbCrO4 microrods are single-crystalline in the shape of a long rod with a 1 μm squared cross-section where a well-organized PbCrO4 growth is achieved with a low nucleation rate. The as-deposited PbCrO4 microrods absorb UV and visible light (λ < 540 nm), and utilize it for the photoelectrochemical reaction. The photoactivity of PbCrO4 microrods is greater than that of PbCrO4 nanorods, having originated from an enhanced minority carrier diffusion length increased by approximately 100 nm. PbCrO4 microrods with the help of Co–Pi decoration exhibit a noticeable photocurrent (0.5 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE under 1.5 AMG illumination) and high incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (30% at λ = 400 nm) for photoelectrochemical water oxidation. Co–Pi decoration also effectively suppresses the formation of Pb4+ in PbCrO4, and improves the stability of the as-deposited PbCrO4 microrods with higher faradaic efficiency, as measured with scanning electrochemical microscopy. Furthermore, the control of electrodeposition potential is found to change the deposit composition between Pb and Cr, which leads to the transition from PbCrO4 to Pb2CrO5.
Introduction
Since the early research on TiO2 for the photocatalytic decomposition of water into H2 and O2,1 oxide-based photocatalysts have received much attention for their useful application in the decomposition of micro-organisms2–4 and environmental pollutants,5,6 nitrogen fixation,7 and biomass conversion,8 as well as photocatalytic water splitting,1,9–12 supported by their great abundance and excellent stability in photo-oxidative or reductive conditions. In the electronic structure of a transition metal oxide semiconductor, the valence band is usually composed of oxygen 2p orbitals due to its high electronegativity, and the conduction band is based on the metal d orbitals,13,14 and consequently its band gap is usually wide. The introduction of additional ns2 cations (e.g., Bi3+, Sn2+, and Pb2+) into metal oxides leads to hybridization between the oxygen 2p orbital and the filled s orbital, which results in a narrower band gap, and enables the visible light response of the photocatalyst.11,15,16 BiVO4 is a representative binary transition metal oxide photocatalyst with a narrow band gap (2.4 eV), and it has been well studied for its application in photoelectrochemical water splitting.11 As another binary transition metal oxide composed of elements adjacent to BiVO4 in the periodic table, PbCrO4 is a well-known yellow pigment and an n-type semiconductor with a monoclinic scheelite structure (Cr-centered tetrahedra surrounded by Pb2+ cations).17 Its application in an optoelectronic material has been reported.18,19 It also has been investigated for photocatalytic water splitting, although it has not shown significant efficiency so far.20,21 Recently, Lee et al. examined the photoelectrochemical properties of PbCrO4 in sulfite (SO32−) solution, and electrochemically assessed its band structure.22
Oxide semiconductors can be synthesized via various preparation methods such as precipitation, hydrothermal synthesis, spray pyrolysis, metal–organic decomposition, chemical bath deposition, and electrochemical deposition (e.g., electrodeposition). Among these methods, electrodeposition is superior in terms of the process cost and scalability.23 However, electrodeposition of a semiconductor is not straightforward since it requires precise control of the crystallinity, impurity, and composition. In addition, the electron transfer for electrodeposition depends on the electronic properties of the deposited semiconductor, and the formation of junctions between the deposited semiconductor and the metallic substrate, or between the deposited semiconductor and the electrolyte, should be considered.24 Electrodeposition carried out at relatively low temperature (<500 °C) usually generates an amorphous semiconductor, and post-heat treatment is required for the organization of the crystal structure followed by the construction of the electronic band structure.24,25 Therefore, direct electrodeposition of a well-organized crystalline semiconductor is found only under specific circumstances for “self-organization”, such as electrochemical liquid–liquid–solid crystal growth25 and electrochemical atomic layer epitaxy.26
In general crystallization, the growth of a large crystal is usually limited by a secondary nucleation, and it is observed at a low nucleation rate.27 In the classical model for the nucleation and particle growth, the nucleation rate (J) is written as follows:28 (1)where A is a constant, k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature, c is the supersaturated solution concentration, c* is the equilibrium concentration at a given temperature, γ is the surface energy, and v is the molecular volume. PbCrO4 has a relatively high surface energy (0.178 J m−2) compared to conventional salts and oxides,29 and accordingly, its nucleation rate is expected to be small, which is favourable to the crystallization rather than the particle generation (nucleation).27 Single-crystalline PbCrO4 nanorods have actually been simply synthesized via precipitation in many studies,30–34 implying that PbCrO4 would also be fabricated through different growth techniques, for example, direct semiconductor electrodeposition. In this study, we synthesized single-crystalline PbCrO4 microrods via direct electrodeposition. We found that directly electrodeposited single-crystalline PbCrO4 microrods exhibited superior photoactivity compared to their nano-sized counterpart, and they were highly photoactive to the water oxidation reaction. Although the photoresponse of PbCrO4 has been studied previously,20–22 its efficient photoelectrochemical water oxidation has not been reported elsewhere, to the best of our knowledge. It was realized by its single-crystalline electrochemical growth in the micrometer scale, as introduced in this study. We also explored the effect of the electrodeposition potential on the crystal structure and composition of PbCrO4.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1a shows the scheme for PbCrO4 electrodeposition in the electrolyte containing Pb2+ and Cr3+ ions. As the Cr3+ ion is electrochemically oxidized to a chromate ion (CrO42−), the precipitation reaction between Pb2+ and CrO42− occurs spontaneously as the equilibrium concentration of CrO42− is close to zero (Eeq = 1.38 × 10−18 M from eqn (3) below) in this condition, resulting in the PbCrO4 deposition at the substrate. HCrO−4 + 7H+ + 3e− = Cr3+ + 4H2O, E0 = 1.38 V vs. NHE35(2) Pb2+ + HCrO−4 = PbCrO4 + H+, ΔG0 = −99.67 kJ mol−1(3) 2HCrO−4 = Cr2O2−7 + H2O, K = 33.9(4)

Reaction (2) involves the multiple electron transfer, and is expected to be electrochemically irreversible. The precipitation reaction (3) would compete with the dichromate formation reaction (4). However, since the concentration of the electrochemically generated chromate ion would be low (≪60 mM), the dichromate would be a minor species (Fig. S1†). Fig. 1b shows the cyclic voltammograms measured in the electrolyte solutions of Pb2+ alone, Cr3+ alone, and a mixture of Pb2+ and Cr3+, respectively. As expected, an insignificant current for Cr3+ oxidation was observed on the FTO surface (Fig. 1b and its inset). In cyclic voltammetry (CV), for a solution of Pb2+ (with pH adjusted to 2.7), surface redox peaks were observed, and this is attributed to the deposition and removal of PbO2. When Pb2+ and Cr3+ ions were both present in the electrolyte, the synergetic current whose onset potential was almost identical to that of PbO2 deposition was found (Fig. 1b). Coincidently, PbO2 is a heterogeneous electrocatalyst for the oxidation of Cr3+ to chromate,36 and therefore, depositing PbO2 would catalyze the Cr3+ oxidation. In fact, in contrast to the small Cr3+ oxidation current on the FTO, the significant increase in the oxidation current was found at the PbO2 surface electrodeposited on the FTO beforehand (Fig. 1c). The increased current is attributed to the catalyzed Cr3+ oxidation accompanied by PbCrO4 formation, resulting in yellow deposits on the FTO after CV. Fig. 1d is the chronoamperogram with varying applied potentials on the pristine and PbO2-deposited FTO surface in the electrolyte containing Pb2+ and Cr3+. The pre-deposition of PbO2 led to the significant difference in the current response at low potential (<1.2 V vs. Ag/AgCl), although the difference became negligible at higher potential (≥1.3 V vs. Ag/AgCl) where PbO2 was being deposited simultaneously. At 1.1–1.2 V vs. Ag/AgCl, a yellow deposit was observed on the PbO2-deposited surface, whereas no deposit appeared on pristine FTO.
The reaction scheme in Fig. 1a was verified by the formation of the yellow deposit. XRD measurements showed that the as-deposited film is crystalline PbCrO4 with a monoclinic structure (Fig. 2a). The SEM image revealed that the as-deposited PbCrO4 was in the form of well-faceted microrods with a rectangular cross-section (Fig. 2b). As electrodeposition proceeded, the PbCrO4 microrods grew up to 1.5 ± 0.2 μm in width and to 21 ± 0.3 μm in length (aspect ratio 14), and their population (deposit coverage) rather than their size increased (Fig. S2†). EDS analysis confirmed the 1:1 atomic ratio of Pb and Cr (Fig. 2c). Fig. 2d shows the bright-field TEM image of a single PbCrO4 microrod, which shows clear flat crystal facets. The selected-area electron diffraction pattern (Fig. 2d inset) of the PbCrO4 microrod indicated that the as-deposited PbCrO4 microrod is single-crystalline. It is presumed that the high surface energy and accompanying low nucleation rate of PbCrO4 would play an important role in self-organized electrodeposition, and in fact, a low nucleation rate was confirmed with a low number density (or coverage) of PbCrO4 microrods on FTO.

The shape and crystal structure of PbCrO4 microrods were investigated under various electrodeposition conditions. In electrodeposition (or electrocrystallization), the nucleation was initiated by the supersaturation of the depositing species, induced by the electrochemical reaction.37 As mentioned above, the single-crystalline PbCrO4 nanorods can be easily synthesized by precipitation which is usually carried out with a few hundred mol L−1 of supersaturation.22,31,33 Note that the electrodeposited PbCrO4 rods could grow up to the μm-scale, while the PbCrO4 rods synthesized via the conventional precipitation method are usually in the nm-scale. This could be explained by the small current (<0.2 mA cm−2) for Cr3+ oxidation from its irreversible kinetics, along with a small concentration of the electrochemical supersaturation (≪60 mM). Therefore, it led to the smaller nucleation rate according to eqn (1),37 which was a preferential condition for bigger crystal growth. Due to the slow kinetics of Cr3+ oxidation, the change in the concentration of Cr3+ in the electrolyte did not have a significant influence on the crystal growth (Fig. S3†). However, the decrease in the relative ratio of the Cr3+ concentration to the Pb2+ concentration led to the appearance of Pb2CrO5 in addition to PbCrO4 (Fig. S4†). Pb2CrO5 (Eg = 2.1 eV), which is another chromate pigment known as “chrome orange,”17 and which is also a photoactive material,22,38 is usually obtained by precipitation under basic conditions31 or Pb2+-rich conditions.34 The electrochemical formation of Pb2CrO5 can be accounted for in a similar way. In electrocrystallization, the electrode potential is the most decisive factor for the nucleation rate.37 The potential window for PbCrO4 electrodeposition without the side reactions, such as deposition and stripping of PbO2, is narrow, from 1.1 to 1.2 V vs. Ag/AgCl, and the wide variation of the electrode potential is not desirable. However, as the deposition potential increased, the shape of the PbCrO4 deposit gradually transformed from rod to plate without any change in its crystal structure (Fig. S5†). A similar transition of the shape of the PbCrO4 precipitate was also observed under acidic conditions where the deprotonation of HCrO4− is suppressed.31 Likewise, at high deposition potential, the local pH near the electrode is low, since the electrochemical oxidation of Cr3+ (eqn (2)), Pb2+, and water liberates many protons, which might lead to the shape transition. It was also found that the higher deposition potential could lead to the complete transition of the deposit from PbCrO4 to Pb2CrO5 with the help of post-heat treatment. As mentioned above, at over 1.3 V of the deposition potential, amorphous PbO2 was co-deposited with PbCrO4 microrods (Fig. S3†), and it would decompose to PbO upon post-annealing, and react with PbCrO4 to form Pb2CrO5. The XRD spectra (Fig. S6†) of the deposit grown at low potential (≤1.4 V vs. Ag/AgCl) corresponded to the monoclinic PbCrO4 with tiny peaks from Pb2CrO5. At 1.5 V, the deposit was completely converted to Pb2CrO5, and the additional pattern attributed to PbO was observed at higher potential. The transition to Pb2CrO5 caused the color change (from yellow to orange).
As the surface energy can be alleviated by the surfactant in the solution for electrodeposition, it would change the crystal size and shape,39,40 and this was found with the addition of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) in this study. Although the current for the electrodeposition of PbCrO4 did not change much with the addition of SDS, the width of the PbCrO4 rods electrodeposited with SDS significantly decreased to less than 200 nm, while its number density increased explosively (Fig. S7†). This clearly indicates the higher nucleation rate with the addition of SDS, and therefore, would support the explanation of the self-organized electrodeposition of PbCrO4 microrods.
Semiconductors electrodeposited through self-organization would have good physical properties without the additional recrystallization step,24,41 and in this study, the light absorbance and photoactivity of the as-deposited PbCrO4 microrods were measured as an indicator of the well-organized electronic band structure (Fig. 3). In the UV-vis spectrum, the onset of the light absorption was found at around the wavelength of 550 nm (Fig. 3a). The relevant Tauc plot showed that it was better fitted to the plot for the direct band gap compared with the indirect band gap (Fig. S8†), and the band gap of PbCrO4 microrods was 2.3 eV (Fig. 3a inset), which is consistent with previous reports.21,22,42 The photoactivity of PbCrO4 microrods electrodeposited on FTO was estimated from photo-induced oxidation of sulfite (SO32−) in the photoelectrochemical cell irradiated with a full Xe lamp (Fig. 3b). The photocurrent (jph) increased with increasing PbCrO4 deposit amount due to the increase in its coverage and thickness (Fig. S2†), and it reached up to 0.6 mA cm−2 (Fig. 3c). Due to its low nucleation rate, a significant portion of the FTO surface was exposed to the electrolyte during the measurements, which can allow a solution-mediated recombination.43 In this study, however, the effect of the exposed FTO was insignificant since the increase in jph was not observed after its passivation (Fig. S9†).43 The photoactivity of Pb2CrO5 electrodeposited in the Pb2+-rich electrolyte (Fig. S4†) or electrodeposited at high overpotential (Fig. S6†) was negligible compared to the photoactivity of PbCrO4 microrods in spite of the redshift of the absorption band (Fig. S6c†) due to its small band gap (2.1 eV).38 Lee et al.22 reported that the photoresponse of Pb2CrO5 was superior to that of PbCrO4, which contradicts our result. This might be due to the difference in the crystallinity of PbCrO4. The photoactivity of the PbCrO4 microrods was also compared to that of the PbCrO4 nanorods (Fig. 3c and S10, see the ESI† for experimental details). Clearly, the microrods exhibited a higher photoresponse (up to 6 times greater) than that of the PbCrO4 nanorods (Fig. 3c). In contrast to the microrods, the photoresponse of the nanorods did not vary with their amount, indicating that charge transport through PbCrO4 nanorods influenced the photoactivity more significantly than light absorption. A photoelectrode film consisting of nanocrystals would be more resistive due to the barrier from the inter-particle charge transport,44 whereas a photoelectrode film with microcrystals would imply lower barrier density of the film. Therefore, the high photoactivity of the electrodeposited PbCrO4 microrods would be attributed to the enhanced charge transport, that is, the increase in the minority carrier diffusion length in its self-organized crystal structure. Previously, the width of PbCrO4 rods electrodeposited with SDS was in the nanometer range, while the length (10–20 μm) was the same as that of microrods. In contrast to nanorods, the photoactivity of PbCrO4 grown with SDS was almost equal to that of microrods (Fig. S7d†). This indicates that the high photoactivity of the PbCrO4 microrods was attributed to the long carrier diffusion along the rods.45

(c) Plot of the photocurrent (at 0.4 V vs. Ag/AgCl) for sulfite oxidation on PbCrO4 microrods and nanorods versus PbCrO4 amount per unit area. 
For bulk semiconductor, the relationship between the minority carrier diffusion length (L) and jph can be expressed as the Butler–Gärtner equation:46 (5)where q is the electronic charge, Φ is the incident light flux, α is the absorption coefficient (assuming monochromatic illumination), and W is the depletion layer width. This equation has also been applied to the evaluation of jph from ∼100 nm wide TiO2 nanorods.47 In this study, however, the relationship is not as straightforward as above, since jph flowed through the PbCrO4 film composed of micro(or nano)-crystallites rather than the micro(or nano-)rod itself. In this case, the effect of grain boundaries becomes significant as mentioned above. Moreover, the existence of pores inside the film, the random arrangement of rods, and their anisotropic carrier transport make it almost impossible to describe jph theoretically. Nevertheless, the equation might be still useful to compare the carrier transport of microrods and nanorods roughly. In the photoelectrochemical measurements with sulfite as a hole scavenger, the recombination of photo-generated carriers in the space charge region of PbCrO4 could be ignored since the kinetics for its oxidation is relatively fast. Moreover, the transport of majority carriers (electrons) of PbCrO4 microrods did not limit the photocurrent as PbCrO4 microrods illuminated from the back-side (through FTO) exhibited quite lower photocurrents compared to that with the front-side illumination (Fig. S11†). These results indicated that the characteristics of jph for PbCrO4 microrods satisfied additional assumptions for the Butler–Gärtner equation.14,46 The minority carrier diffusion length can be usually obtained for the photoelectrochemical cell by plotting the photocurrent (or external quantum efficiency, η = jph/qΦ = 1240/λ × jph/Pin, where λ and Pin are the wavelength (nm) and incident power density of illuminated light, respectively) with respect to the potential (or depletion layer width).48–50 In this study, however, the measurement of jph was perturbed by sulfite oxidation on the exposed PbO2 and FTO surface at high potential (>0.5 V vs. Ag/AgCl), whereby linear extrapolation of the plot of η against (V − Vfb)1/2 would not give accurate L values (Fig. S12†). However, if both the PbCrO4 films composed of microrods and nanorods have the same α, carrier density, and consequently W, the comparison between jph for the microrods and the nanorods leads to the following equation (see the ESI†): (6)
These assumptions are roughly valid for both cases. At 4 μmol cm−2 of PbCrO4 electrodeposited or loaded on FTO, both rods showed similar absorbance in the UV-vis spectrum, and a similar slope in the Mott–Schottky plot (Fig. S13†). Table 1 lists the measured and calculated value of each term in eqn (6) where the reflection was not corrected for the calculation of η. Since (1 − ηnanorod)/(1 − ηmicrorod) was close to 1, the second term on the right of eqn (6) mainly contributed to the increment of the diffusion length, and it ranged from 100 nm to 200 nm, as listed in Table 1. Considering that the typical value of the minority carrier diffusion length for polycrystalline BiVO4 is about 100–200 nm,50,51 and for Fe2O3, it is less than 10 nm,52 the increment would be significant. The post-heat treatment slightly enhanced the photoresponse with lower onset potential for the photo-oxidation (Fig. S14†), and it might be associated with the modification of the surface recombination state and the decrease in the contact resistance between PbCrO4 microrods and FTO.

Fig. 4a shows the linear sweep voltammograms of the electrodeposited PbCrO4 microrods under UV-vis irradiation in 0.2 M sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7). The evolution of the photo-oxidation current was found on the PbCrO4 microrods, and this might be attributed to the water oxidation. The photocurrent was enhanced by the decoration of Co–Pi on PbCrO4 microrods, which could be understood as the improvement of water oxidation kinetics by analogy with the synergetic effect of Co–Pi with Fe2O3 and BiVO4.51–54 The photoelectrochemical water oxidation on the PbCrO4 microrods was confirmed upon the detection of evolved oxygen via scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM), which has been successfully utilized for the characterization of the water oxidation reaction on the photoelectrode (Fig. 4b).55,56 Oxygen evolved on PbCrO4 microrods irradiated from the back side of the FTO, diffused to a Pt disk ultramicroelectrode (UME) located about 11 μm above the PbCrO4 substrate, and then it was reduced on a cathodically polarized UME. The distance between the Pt tip and the PbCrO4 substrate was estimated from the extent of the negative feedback of the current for ferrocenemethanol oxidation (Fig. S15†). As the oxidation current on PbCrO4 microrods emerged upon light illumination, the big reduction current arose on the Pt UME. In contrast to the instantaneous response of the oxidation current to the light irradiation, the reduction current was developed and dissipated rather slowly, and this would be associated with the diffusion of oxygen near the Pt UME surface. The decoration of Co–Pi increased both currents on the Pt tip and PbCrO4 substrate, as expected. The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) for the photoelectrochemical water oxidation on PbCrO4 microrods decorated with Co–Pi was obtained by the measurement of the steady-state photocurrent at 1.23 V vs. RHE under irradiation of monochromatic light. In the IPCE spectrum (Fig. 4c), the photoresponse emerged at 550 nm, which corresponded to a 2.3 eV band gap, and it was consistent with the optical bandgap measurements (Fig. 3a). It reached up to 30%, and it was comparable to Fe2O3 and BiVO4 decorated with Co–Pi.51,52 In addition, jph predicted from the integration of the IPCE data with the standard solar spectral distribution (AMG 1.5) agrees well with the measured values, which confirms the photocurrent magnitudes reported.

(b) SECM chronoamperograms in the TC/SG mode for photoelectrochemical water oxidation on PbCrO4 microrods at 1.23 V vs. RHE in a pH 6.8 phosphate buffer solution (bottom) and the detection (reduction) of the generated oxygen using a Pt UME at 0.1 V vs. RHE (top). The measurements started in the dark. UV-vis light irradiation time spanned from 30 s to 90 s. (c) Incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) of PbCrO4 microrods decorated with Co–Pi for photoelectrochemical water oxidation. The photocurrent was measured in pH 6.8 phosphate buffer (HPO42−:H2PO4− = 1:1) aqueous solution, applying 1.23 V vs. RHE. 
In the continuous water oxidation of the PbCrO4 microrods at 1.23 V vs. RHE, the photocurrent gradually decreased, which manifested its instability, whereas the stability as well as the magnitude of the photocurrent was enhanced with Co–Pi decoration (Fig. 5a). Pb was not found in the buffer solution before and after the water oxidation, which indicated that the instability was not associated with the dissolution of PbCrO4 (Table S1†). In CV analysis of the PbCrO4 microrods in the dark (Fig. S16†), surface-related redox peaks were found in the range of 1.0 to 1.3 V vs. Ag/AgCl, which is similar to those of Pb4+/Pb2+ (E0 = 1.69 V vs. NHE)21 in lead oxide (shown in Fig. 1b). Therefore, this indicated that Pb2+ in PbCrO4 could be photoelectrochemically oxidized to Pb4+ simultaneously with the water oxidation, and it might be in the form of PbO2. The high reduction current after switching the light off would be attributed to the reduction of Pb4+ back to Pb2+, whereas the Co–Pi-decorated PbCrO4 microrods exhibited a negligible reduction current (Fig. 5a). In XPS analysis of the PbCrO4 microrods (Fig. 5b), Pb 4f peaks shifted to a lower binding energy after the water oxidation (1.23 V vs. RHE for 440 s), which corresponded to the Pb 4f of PbO2.57 The disappearance of the Cr 2p peak after water oxidation verified the photodecomposition of PbCrO4 to PbO2. In the case of PbCrO4 microrods decorated with Co–Pi, Cr was still detected, although its intensity decreased, which showed that the formation of PbO2 was suppressed by Co–Pi decoration. Enhanced stability of PbCrO4 microrods decorated with Co–Pi would appear as higher faradaic efficiency, which was actually observed in SECM measurements. A faradaic efficiency of the photoelectrochemical water oxidation on PbCrO4 microrods could be measured and monitored from the SECM measurements; assuming the linear diffusion boundary layer, the surface concentration of oxygen, and the corresponding current on the tip along with the oxygen generation on the PbCrO4 substrate could be roughly estimated (the details of the calculations are in the ESI.†). Fig. 5c shows the change in the faradaic efficiencies of PbCrO4 with and without Co–Pi decoration during SECM measurements (in Fig. 5b). The faradaic efficiency of PbCrO4 decorated with Co–Pi increased sharply as soon as PbCrO4 was irradiated, and was maintained at about 75%, whereas the faradaic efficiency of bare PbCrO4 microrods was lower and decreased gradually. This indicates that Co–Pi decoration enhanced the stability of PbCrO4 as well as the photoresponse. Considering 15–20% underestimation of the faradaic efficiency in the calculations (see the ESI†), the faradaic efficiency of PbCrO4 decorated with Co–Pi might be over 90%.

(d) Schematic diagram of photoelectrochemical water oxidation on PbCrO4 microrods decorated with Co–Pi. 
The scheme of photoelectrochemical water oxidation on PbCrO4 microrods decorated with Co–Pi is illustrated in Fig. 5d. From the Mott–Schottky plot measurements (Fig. S13b†), flat band potential, which would denote the Fermi level with respect to the reference electrode, was estimated to be approximately −0.6 V vs. Ag/AgCl, and it was almost equal to 0 V vs. NHE at pH 0, considering the change in the Helmholtz potential (−59 mV pH−1),14 and it was very close to the value reported in ref. 21. Meanwhile, it was a little lower than the value in ref. 22, which might have originated from the difference in the doping density. The photo-generated holes in the PbCrO4 microrods are utilized for water oxidation (path 1 in Fig. 5d), and some of them contribute to Pb2+ oxidation in PbCrO4 (path 2 in Fig. 5d), or just recombine at the surface and bulk. With Co–Pi decoration, the reaction rate for path 1 would be enhanced compared to the rate for path 2 and recombination, due to improved water oxidation kinetics by Co–Pi decoration. However, Co–Pi decoration did not completely suppress the photodecomposition of PbCrO4 microrods, as the photocurrent for the Co–Pi-decorated PbCrO4 microrods decreases slightly (Fig. 5a), and the improvement of the stability against the photo-oxidation of PbCrO4 itself would be critical for its utilization.
Experimental
Materials
Pb(NO3)2 (>99%, ACS reagent, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, USA), Cr(NO3)3·9H2O (>99%, ACS reagent, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, USA), KNO3 (>99%, ACS reagent, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, USA), Na2SO3 (>98%, ACS reagent, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, USA), Na2SO4 (>99%, ACS reagent, Acros Chemicals, New Jersey, USA), and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS, >99%, ACS reagent, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, USA) were used as received. Milli-Q deionized (DI) water was used to prepare the electrolytes for the electrochemical experiments. F-doped tin oxide (FTO) coated glass (<14 Ω, 10 mm × 15 mm, TEC 15, WY-GMS) was used as a substrate.
Single-crystalline PbCrO4 electrodeposition
The electrodeposition electrolyte (3 ml) was composed of 5 mM Pb(NO3)2 (0.0005 g in 3 ml), 60 mM Cr(NO3)3·9H2O (0.0720 g in 3 ml), and 0.1 M KNO3 (0.0303 g in 3 ml). The electrolyte was acidic (pH 2.7) due to the hydrolysis of the Cr3+ ion.35 Cr(H2O)3+6 = Cr(H2O)5OH2+ + H+, K = 1.6 × 10−4(7)
Electrodeposition was performed on the FTO substrate (0.26 cm2) at room temperature by applying various potentials (from 1.1 to 1.7 V) using a CHI 631E Electrochemical Analyzer (CH Instruments, Austin, TX) with respect to an Ag/AgCl reference electrode. Pt wire (1 mm dia) was used as a counter electrode. Prior to the PbCrO4 electrodeposition, a PbO2 catalyst (amorphous islands, 100–200 nm dia) was formed by applying 1.5 V vs. Ag/AgCl for 20 s (18 mC cm−2) to the FTO substrate in the electrolyte (3 ml) containing 5 mM Pb(NO3)2 (0.0005 g in 3 ml) and 0.1 M KNO3 (0.0303 g in 3 ml). If necessary, the PbCrO4 deposit film was annealed at 550 °C for 1 h (1 °C min−1 increment from room temperature).
Photoelectrochemical characterization
The photoactivity of the electrodeposited PbCrO4 microrods was measured by exposing the metal oxide working electrode (0.26 cm2) to the electrolyte and UV-vis light. All photoelectrochemical measurements were carried out in a borosilicate glass cell (30 ml capacity) with a Pt counter electrode and an Ag/AgCl reference electrode. The potential for the photoelectrochemical water oxidation is reported with respect to the reversible hydrogen electrode. UV-vis light was irradiated using an Xe lamp (Oriel, Darmstadt, Germany) with an incident light intensity of approximately 100 mW cm−2. For the IPCE measurements, a monochromator (Cornerstone 130, Oriel, Darmstadt, Germany), photodiode detector (918D-UV-OD3R, Newport, Irvine, CA), and optical meter (1918-R, Newport, Irvine, CA) were used. The electrolyte (20 ml) was 0.1 M Na2SO3 (0.252 g in 20 ml)/0.1 M Na2SO4 (0.284 g in 20 ml) or 0.2 M phosphate buffer solution (pH 6.8, Na2HPO4:NaH2PO4 = 1:1, 0.283 g and 0.240 g, respectively in 20 ml). For Co–Pi decoration, PbCrO4 microrods on FTO were immersed in the phosphate-buffer solution containing 0.05 mM Co(NO3)2·6H2O (0.0003 g in 20 ml), and the electrode potential was swept from 0.7 to 1.6 V vs. RHE (4 times) under UV-vis light illumination.
Oxygen detection using SECM
Oxygen evolved from water oxidation of the PbCrO4 microrods was detected via the substrate generation-tip collection (SG-TC) mode of SECM (CHI920D, CH Instruments, Austin, TX). A Pt UME was employed as a tip electrode to collect the evolved oxygen. To prepare the Pt UME, a 10 μm dia Pt wire (Goodfellow, 99.99% purity) was sealed in a borosilicate glass capillary (inner dia 0.75 mm/outer dia 1 mm) under vacuum. The Pt electrode tip was mechanically polished with 600 mesh sandpaper (Buehler, Lake Bluff, IL) until the metal disk was exposed, followed by further smoothing with 1200 mesh abrasive SiC paper and an alumina suspension in water down to 50 nm (Buehler). The glass sheath surrounding the disk was also polished and beveled in order to make it easier to move the electrode close to the substrate without the glass sheath crashing into the substrate. The tip position during SECM measurements was controlled using an xyz-stepper motor (T-LA28A, Zaber Technologies Inc., Vancouver, Canada) on an SECM stage. The substrate electrode was PbCrO4-deposited FTO mounted in a Teflon cell (exposed area: 0.16 cm2). The tip approached the substrate slowly (0.5 μm s−1) until it was positioned 10 μm away from the substrate. The distance between the tip and the substrate was estimated from the oxidation tip current (iT) of 1 mM ferrocenemethanol (0.0006 g in 3 ml DI), where the iT decreased as the tip electrode approached the substrate, i.e., the negative feedback mode of SECM.58 To detect the oxygen generated from the photoelectrode, an oxygen reduction current was detected at the tip electrode in a 0.2 M sodium phosphate buffer solution (3 ml) with the tip potential held at −0.5 V vs. Ag/AgCl (=0.1 V vs. RHE), while the substrate was biased to 0.62 V vs. Ag/AgCl (=1.23 V vs. RHE) for the OER. The tip potential was sufficiently negative to ensure the complete reduction of diffusing oxygen, but positive to prevent any secondary reactions, for example, the HER (E0 = 0 V vs. RHE = −0.61 V vs. Ag/AgCl at pH 7). The photoelectrode was illuminated with UV-vis light from the back side through the hole on the bottom of the Teflon cell, using the light guide connected to an Xe lamp.
Material characterization
XRD measurements were performed on the electrodeposited PbCrO4 microrods by using an SWXD diffractometer (Rigaku Co., Japan) equipped with a Cu Kα radiation source. The morphologies and chemical compositions of the metal oxides were characterized by FESEM-EDS (JSM-6500F, JEOL, Japan), TEM (JEM 2100, JEOL, Japan), and XPS (K-Alpha, Thermo Fisher, monochromatic Al X-ray source). For TEM analysis, the PbCrO4 microrods were dislodged from the FTO by the sonication of the PbCrO4-deposited FTO substrate in a DI water bath, and then the PbCrO4-dispersed solution was dropped onto the TEM grid. UV-visible absorption spectra were acquired with a UV-vis spectrophotometer (Cary 60 UV-vis, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) for wavelengths from 400 to 700 nm.
Conclusions
Single-crystalline PbCrO4 microrods could be grown via self-organized electrodeposition based on a low nucleation rate. Due to their well-organized crystal structure, the as-deposited PbCrO4 microrods absorbed UV-visible light, which led to a photoelectrochemical reaction. Moreover, the electrodeposited PbCrO4 microrods exhibited higher photoactivity compared to PbCrO4 nanorods, which might be attributed to the enhanced minority carrier diffusion in PbCrO4 microrods. PbCrO4 microrods were also photoelectrochemically active to water oxidation with a noticeable photocurrent and conversion efficiency, although their photocorrosion based on Pb2+ oxidation was observed. Co–Pi decoration was found to improve the stability as well as the photoactivity effectively.
