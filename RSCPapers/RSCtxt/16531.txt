    , Accepted 20th July 2017First published on 20th July 2017AbstractThree donor–acceptor (D–A)-structured conjugated polymers with different backbones, poly((9,9-dioctylfluorene)-2,7-diyl-alt-benzothiadiazole) (F8BT), poly((9,9-dioctylfluorene)-2,7-diyl-alt-(4,7-bis(3-hexylthien-5-yl)-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole)-2′,2′′-diyl) (F8TBT), and poly(N-9′-heptadecanyl-2,7-carbazole-alt-(4,7-bis(3-hexylthien-5-yl)-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole)-2′,2′′-diyl) (C8TBT), were synthesized via conventional Suzuki polymerization. All three polymers showed good thermal and electrochemical stabilities. The UV-vis absorption spectra indicated that the introduction of thiophene units into the polymer backbone decreased the bandgap of the polymers. When the three polymer films were doped with FeCl3, different thermoelectric properties were observed. F8TBT and C8TBT, which contained thiophene units, showed a higher electrical conductivity than F8BT. As the temperature increased, C8TBT exhibited the highest Seebeck coefficient of 335 μV K−1 at 90 °C and a maximum power factor of 13.11 μW m−1 K−2. These results demonstrated that the polymer backbone structure greatly influences the thermoelectric properties and the inclusion of thiophene and carbazole units can effectively improve the thermoelectric properties. Therefore, this work is a novel and important reference to design and synthesize high-performance thermoelectric conjugated polymers.
Introduction
The global energy shortage and growing energy demands provide impetus for improving the efficiency of energy conversion technologies. In recent years, thermoelectric materials have attracted great attention. By transforming heat energy into electrical energy, thermoelectric materials offer a promising technology to fully utilize industrial waste heat and automobile waste heat.1,2 Generally, the conversion efficiency of thermoelectric materials is evaluated in terms of the dimensionless figure of merit ZT, which is expressed as ZT = S2σT/κ, where σ is the electrical conductivity, S is the Seebeck coefficient, T is the absolute temperature and κ is the thermal conductivity. For organic materials, the precise thermal conductivity is difficult to obtain due to its very low value; therefore, the power factor (PF = S2σ) is typically used in the evaluation of organic materials. An ideal thermoelectric material would possess a high Seebeck coefficient, high electrical conductivity, and low thermal conductivity.
Due to their good thermoelectric conversion efficiency, inorganic thermoelectric materials, such as bismuth telluride, skutterudites, clathrates, and Zintl phases, have been widely studied.3–6 However, the use of these inorganic thermoelectric materials is limited by their toxic nature, high cost, poor processability, and low natural abundance.7–9 Compared to inorganic thermoelectric materials, organic thermoelectric materials exhibit several advantages, such as light weight, flexibility, low cost, and easy processing into versatile forms.10,11 Conjugated polymers, as a promising class of organic thermoelectric materials, have attracted wide interest due to their low thermal conductivity, high Seebeck coefficient, and good conductivity, which are generally expected to be advantageous for enhancing thermoelectric properties in terms of the performance of a thermoelectric material evaluated by the ZT. To date, research on thermoelectric conjugated polymers primarily focused on polythiophenes, polyanilines, polypyrroles, polyphenylenevinylenes, and their organic/inorganic composite materials.12–20
As reported, the comprehensive thermoelectric properties of pure conjugated polymers are still inferior than those of conventional inorganic thermoelectric materials. Therefore, the simultaneous improvement of the Seebeck coefficient and electrical conductivity is an urgent task for thermoelectric applications of conjugated polymers.21 The physical and chemical properties of conjugated polymers are easily tuned by tailoring their molecular structures, which has been proved feasible in fluorescence sensors, organic field-effect transistors, organic solar cells, and thermoelectric applications.22–25 However, the structure–thermoelectric properties of conjugated polymers are still unclear; therefore, research into this aspect would help clarify the structure and thermoelectric properties of conjugated polymers. In this study, conjugated polymers with a donor–acceptor (D–A)-type architecture were examined because these conjugated polymers usually have a narrow bandgap, which is beneficial to the thermoelectric performance, as determined by our previous research results,26,27 and the presence of delocalized electrons in the backbone of these conjugated polymers can induce strong stacking interactions, facilitate effective charge-carrier transport and enhance the electrical conductivity.28,29 Polyfluorene and poly(2,7-carbazole) derivatives have been widely used as polymer light-emitting electrochemical cells and organic photovoltaics,30–34 but they are rarely investigated as thermoelectric materials. In this paper, we chose fluorene and carbazole as the electron-donor units, benzothiadiazole as the electron-acceptor unit, and introduced the thiophene unit to tune the bandgap of polymers. A series of D–A-type conjugated polymers with different backbone structures were designed and synthesized. We systematically investigated the effect of delocalized electrons and stacking interactions on the thermoelectric properties by changing the backbone structure of the conjugated polymers.
Experimental
Materials
The monomers 2,2′-(9,9-dioctyl-9H-fluorene-2,7-diyl)bis(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolane), 4,7-dibromobenzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole, 4,7-bis(5-bromo-4-hexylthiophen-2-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole, and 9-(heptadecan-9-yl)-2,7-bis(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)-9H-carbazole were purchased from Derthon Optoelectronic Materials Science Technology Co., Ltd, Shenzhen, China. Tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium (Pd(PPh3)4) and potassium carbonate (K2CO3) were purchased from Energy Chemical, Shanghai, China. Toluene was purchased from commercial sources and dried with CaH2 prior to use. All other reagents, including distilled water, methanol (AR), chloroform (AR), and acetone (AR) were used as received without any further purification.
Polymer synthesis
The polymer F8BT was synthesized by Suzuki polymerization (Scheme 1). A mixture of 2,2′-(9,9-dioctyl-9H-fluorene-2,7-diyl)bis(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolane) (642.6 mg, 1 mmol), 7-dibromobenzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (294.0 mg, 1 mmol), K2CO3 (1.38 g, 10 mmol), and Pd(PPh3)4 (34.7 mg, 0.03 mmol) was charged in a two-neck flask equipped with a condenser. Degassed toluene (12 ml) and H2O (2 ml) were injected into the flask by using syringe, and the mixture was stirred at 110 °C for 24 hours under a nitrogen atmosphere. After the mixture was cooled to room temperature, the polymer was extracted with chloroform, filtered through a 0.45 μm nylon filter and dried with MgSO4. Chloroform solvent was removed under reduced pressure. The polymer was precipitated with methanol and washed with acetone to remove oligomers and other impurities. The resulting polymer was finally dried overnight under vacuum. F8BT was obtained as an orange powder (82% yield). 1H NMR (600 MHz, CDCl3, δ): 8.08 (d, J = 6.00 Hz, 2H, Ar H), 8.01 (s, 2H, Di H), 7.96–7.92 (m, 4H, Ar H), 2.13 (s, 4H; CH2), 1.23–1.11 (m, 20H; CH2), 0.94 (s, 4H; CH2), 0.80–0.77 (m, 6H; CH3).

Preparation of the polymer films
Polymer films were prepared on glass plates by drop-casting the polymer chlorobenzene solution. The prepared polymer films were doped with a 0.1 mmol mL−1 FeCl3 solution under a nitrogen atmosphere for 1 h, and then rinsed with excess nitromethane and dried under vacuum at room temperature overnight. The doped thin films were then used in the thermoelectric property tests.
Characterization

1H NMR spectra of the polymers were recorded in deuterated chloroform with tetramethylsilane as an internal reference using a Bruker AVANCE III 600 MHz spectrometer. The average molar mass and distribution were determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) (Waters e2695 Separations Module), where the calibration curves were constructed using a series of monodisperse polystyrene standards (Shodex). Ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorbance spectra of the polymers were collected in chloroform solution using a UV-vis spectrophotometer (Thermo Evolution 220). Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) was conducted on a TGA-Q50 system (TA Instruments, USA) at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under a nitrogen flow of 40 ml min−1 to examine the thermal stability of the polymers, in which the temperature of degradation (Td) corresponds to a 5% weight loss. The melting point of the polymers was measured using a microscope melting point determination apparatus (SGW X-4). Cyclic voltammetry (CV) of the polymers was performed using a CHI 660E electrochemical workstation (Chenhua Instruments Co., Shanghai, China) at room temperature. The measurements were performed in a 0.1 mol L−1 tetrabutylammonium tetrafluoroborate (Bu4NBF4) acetonitrile solution as the background electrolyte, and the data were obtained using platinum working electrodes and an Ag/Ag+ reference electrode (0.01 M of AgNO3 in acetonitrile) at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. The oxidation potential (E1/2ox) of ferrocene is 0.11 V vs. Ag/Ag+. The morphology and elemental distribution of the polymer films were observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Hitachi S-4700). Tapping-mode atomic force microscopy (AFM, Bruker) images were obtained using a Dimension Icon scanning probe microscope (ScanAsyst-Air model). The thermoelectric properties were tested using an MRS-3 M thin film thermoelectric test system (Wuhan Joule Yacht Science & Technology Co., Ltd, China) under vacuum. The polymer films were fixed between two copper plates. The Seebeck coefficients were obtained by changing the temperature between the two copper plates, and the electrical resistivity was acquired simultaneously.
Results and discussion
UV-vis measurements

Fig. 1 shows the UV-vis absorption spectra of the three conjugated polymers with different backbone structures. Two absorption bands were observed for all copolymers. The F8BT film presented maxima at 318 and 462 nm, which correspond to absorptions of the fluorene units and benzothiadiazole units, respectively. The absorption spectra of the F8TBT and C8TBT films presented similar behavior; that is, there are two distinguishable bands at 369 nm and 532 nm, which can be assigned to fluorene (carbazole) and thiophene–benzothiadiazole–thiophene segments. The absorption wavelength thresholds of the three copolymers F8BT, F8TBT, and C8TBT are 540 nm, 680 nm, and 680 nm, respectively, and the calculated bandgap values are 2.3 eV, 1.8 eV, and 1.8 eV, respectively, according to the formula Eg = hc/λg (eV). These results showed that the reduced bandgap of F8TBT, compared to that of F8BT, resulted from the incorporation of additional thiophene units. Furthermore, F8TBT and C8TBT have similar bandgaps, which demonstrated that the introduction of carbazole units into the polymer backbone has no effect on the bandgap of the polymer. By comparing the absorption spectra of the polymers in solution and film, the spectra of the polymers in solid-state films were found to be redshifted. This behavior is associated with the existence of polymer chain planarization or interchain delocalization in the polymer films.35 After the polymers were doped with FeCl3, two additional absorption bands appeared in the spectra of the three polymer films, suggesting the formation of a bipolaron band,36,37 which indicate that all three polymers were successfully doped with FeCl3. We concluded that FeCl3 is an appropriate dopant for polymers with these types of structures.

Thermal stability characterization
The thermal properties of the polymers were characterized by TGA and using a microscope melting point determination apparatus. The TGA curves (Fig. 2) revealed that all three polymers were stable below 300 °C. After doping with FeCl3, the TGA curves of three polymers were obtained. The thermal stability was slightly changed, but the polymers still did not show much weight loss below 250 °C. Therefore, all of the polymers have good thermal stability. The melting point of the three polymers is approximately 160 °C, and the melting point of these polymers doped with FeCl3 is approximately 150 °C.

Characterization of electrochemical properties
The electrochemical properties of the polymers were determined by CV, as shown in Fig. 3. F8BT, F8TBT, and C8TBT showed oxidation onsets of 1.19 V, 0.86 V, and 0.85 V (vs. Ag/Ag+). The oxidation potential onsets were defined as the position where the current began to differ from the baseline.17 The oxidation potential of F8TBT was lower than that of F8BT due to the attachment of more electron-rich thiophene moieties on the polymer backbone. The oxidation potential of C8TBT was basically unchanged from that of F8TBT, which demonstrated that the carbazole unit has no effect on the oxidation potential of the polymers. Successive cyclic voltammograms over 40 oxidation cycles were obtained as shown in Fig. S4–S6,† and we found that all polymers exhibited good redox performance, suggesting that the polymers are electrochemically stable. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest occupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels were obtained by density functional theory (DFT) calculations at the B3LYP/6-31G* level for the dimers of the polymers using the Spartan software package (version 2016), in which the alkyl chain was replaced by a methyl group for clarity. The HOMO surfaces of these polymers are highly delocalized along their backbones, whereas their LUMO surfaces are mainly localized onto the benzothiadiazole units, indicating that a donor–acceptor system was formed in these polymers (Table 1).

Morphologies of the polymer films
The surface morphologies of the polymer films spin-coated on silicon substrates were studied by atomic force microscopy (AFM). The AFM results in Fig. 4 show that all polymers have a regular arrangement with a lamellar fiber structure. Compared to F8BT, the introduction of thiophene and carbazole units onto the polymer backbone enhanced the molecular packing of the polymers. As a result, F8TBT and C8TBT have more regular lamellar fibers, which was confirmed by the high-magnification cross-sectional SEM images as shown in Fig. S7–S9.† The morphologies of the films did not change upon doping with FeCl3, indicating that the doping process did not substantially influence the morphology of the films. The thicknesses of the films prepared by drop-casting were evaluated to be approximately 20 μm, based on the cross-sectional SEM images shown in Fig. 4(g–i). After the polymer films were doped with FeCl3, iron was well dispersed in the films, as determined by energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS) (Fig. 5). This result again proved that FeCl3 is an appropriate doping agent for polymers with these types of structures.

Thermoelectric properties of the polymer films
The temperature-dependent electrical conductivity (σ), Seebeck coefficient (S), and power factor (P) of the three polymers are shown in Fig. 6, 7, and 8, respectively. At room temperature, the electrical conductivities of F8BT, F8TBT, and C8TBT were 0.89 S cm−1, 1.48 S cm−1, and 2.11 S cm−1, respectively. Compared to F8BT, F8TBT and C8TBT have higher electrical conductivities, which can be attributed to the thiophene unit reducing the steric hindrance of the polymer chains and thus promoting the facile formation of a coplanar structure,38 as a result, facilitating electron transfer and increasing the carrier mobility. On the other hand, the presence of a strong electron-withdrawing substituent onto the nitrogen atom in the C8TBT backbone leads to an enhanced electrical conductivity compared to that of F8TBT.39 The temperature increase promoted the carrier mobility, and thus, the electrical conductivity increased with temperature, and the maximum values of F8TBT and C8TBT were 3.08 S cm−1 and 2.49 S cm−1 at 58 °C. When the temperature was larger than 58 °C, the arrangement of the polymers changed, which weakened the interaction between polymer molecules and reduced the conductivity of the polymers.

F8BT has a relatively high Seebeck coefficient of 103 μV K−1 compared with that of F8TBT (45 μV K−1) and C8TBT (50 μV K−1) at room temperature. This result can be explained by the fact that the Seebeck coefficient is inversely proportional to the carrier concentration and carrier mobility.40,41 Furthermore, the introduction of thiophene units increased the carrier concentration and carrier mobility, leading to a decreased Seebeck coefficient. With increasing temperature, the Seebeck coefficients of the three polymers increased. C8TBT showed a more rapid growth rate than F8BT and F8TBT, and the maximum Seebeck coefficients of F8BT, F8TBT, and C8TBT were 172 μV K−1 at 87.6 °C, 224 μV K−1 at 102 °C, and 335 μV K−1 at 90 °C, respectively. These results demonstrated that thiophene and carbazole units can effectively improve the Seebeck coefficients of the polymers at higher temperature. The power factors of F8BT exhibited a similar trend as the electrical conductivities; however, F8TBT and C8TBT showed a trend similar to the Seebeck coefficients. The maximum power factors for F8TBT and C8TBT were 1.81 μW m−1 K−2 at 102 °C and 13.11 μW m−1 K−2 at 90 °C, which were approximately four times and twenty-six times higher than that of F8BT (0.5 μW m−1 K−2). The introduction of thiophene and carbazole units into the polymer backbones clearly had a good effect on the thermoelectric properties of the polymers. In addition, we compared the thermoelectric properties of polyfluorene derivatives, poly(2,7-carbazole) derivatives, and other conjugated polymers as shown in Table S1,† and we found that polyfluorene and poly(2,7-carbazole) derivatives show good thermoelectric performance.
Conclusions
In this study, we systematically examined the effect of the backbone structure of different D–A-structured conjugated polymers on their thermoelectric properties. The introduction of thiophene units decreased the bandgap of the conjugated polymers, increased π–π conjugation accumulation and promoted the formation of a more regular molecular arrangement, resulting in a relatively high conductivity. Carbazole units did not affect the bandgap of the polymers; however, the addition of a strong electron-withdrawing substituent on the nitrogen atom of C8TBT not only increased the electrical conductivity but also improved the Seebeck coefficient of the polymers at increased temperature. Therefore, a maximum power factor of 13.11 μW m−1 K−2 was obtained for C8TBT, which contained both thiophene and carbazole units. The above results suggested that the introduction of thiophene and carbazole units into the polymer backbone can effectively improve the thermoelectric properties of polymers. Our studies provided a novel approach to clarify the dependence of the thermoelectric performance on polymer backbone modification.
