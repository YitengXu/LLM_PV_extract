    , Accepted 28th July 2021First published on 28th July 2021AbstractFast surface charge recombination and poor light capturing capability are regarded as the two critical factors that hamper the photoelectrochemical (PEC) performance of photoanodes. In the present work, we employed N-doping as well as surface modification with plasmonic Au nanoparticles (NPs) for synergistic promotion of PEC efficiency of TiO2 nanorod arrays. The results revealed that that the light harvesting ability and surface charge separation efficiency of TiO2 are significantly enhanced by the synergistic effect of N doping and surface modification of plasmonic Au NPs. Correspondingly, the PEC efficiencies were increased by 7 and 3 times, as compared with those of the pristine TiO2 nanorod arrays and N doping TiO2 (N-TiO2) counterparts, respectively, and were superior to those of most TiO2-based photoanodes ever reported. The present work might give some insight into the rational design of advanced photoanodes with both high efficiency and stability for PEC water splitting.
Introduction
Semiconductor photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting has received considerable attention as a promising modality to solve the energy crises and environmental problems. Since Honda and Fujishima first demonstrated a TiO2 electrode splitting of water via a PEC process,1,2 much effort has been devoted to the development of highly efficient photoelectrodes to boost the PEC performance. Up to now, many kinds of materials, such as oxides,3–5 sulphides,6–8 nitrides,9–11 perovskite materials,12–14 metal–organic frameworks (MOF) materials,15–17 and red phosphorus,18 have been explored as photoelectrodes materials for PEC water splitting. Among them, TiO2 remains one of the promising choices for H2 generation by PEC water splitting, owing to its favourable band-edge positions, high resistance to photocorrosion, physical and chemical stability, natural abundance, nontoxicity, low cost and long-term stability.19–21 However, the PEC water splitting performance of TiO2 based photoelectrodes is still substantially restricted by its large band gap energy (∼3.0 eV for rutile and ∼3.2 eV for anatase), low electron mobility and short minority carrier diffusion length. In order to address these shortcomings, scholars have proposed a variety of methods over the past few decades such as doping nonmetal or metal elements,22,23 construction of heterojunctions,24–28 loading of cocatalyst29,30 and morphology tuning.31,32
Recently, electrodes designed with a one dimensional (1D) nanoarray structure have demonstrated extraordinarily high PEC performance because a 1D nanoarray nanostructure can not only offer a highway for electron transfer in the longitudinal arranged material but also effectively improve light harvesting.33 In addition, another common way of narrowing the band gap is by doping nonmetal elements into TiO2 nanostructures. For example, nitrogen can be used as a dopant in the decrease of the band-gap of TiO2 by introducing filled N2p states above the TiO2 valence band. However, it should be noted that nonmetal element doping can often introduce defects or surface states that can act as new recombination centres, which affect the PEC performance. Thus, nonmetal element doping is still limited for boosting the PEC performance and requires further research. Recently, loading cocatalysts on the surface of TiO2 has also been deemed as an effective strategy to enhance the PEC activity of TiO2.34 Particularly, assembling plasmonic nanoparticles cocatalysts such as gold, silver, aluminum, and copper with TiO2 can induce the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR), which can not only promote interfacial charge separation but also extend the absorbance in the visible region. However, a combination of these methods, such as decoration of Au NPs onto N-doped TiO2 nanorod arrays, has not been studied.
In this paper, we report the synthesis of an efficient photoanode for PEC water splitting, which is assembled using plasmonic Au NPs with N-doped TiO2 nanorod arrays nanorods (denoted as Au/N-TiO2). As illustrated in Scheme 1, the Au/N-TiO2 photoanode was prepared by three sequential steps, including the hydrothermal method, calcination in an ammonia atmosphere and magnetron sputter ion plating. The resulting Au/N-TiO2 photoanode exhibits a higher photocurrent density of 2.8 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE, which is 7 times higher than that of pristine TiO2. The significantly improved PEC water splitting efficiency is attributed to the rapid photogenerated carrier transfer and extended light absorption based on the synergistic effect arising between N doping and Au NP surface modification.

Experimental
Materials
Titanium butoxide (TBOT), hydrochloric acid (HCl, 36–38%), ethanol (CH3CH2OH), and acetone (CH3COCH3) were purchased from Adamas-beta (Shanghai, China) and all chemicals were of analytical grade and were used as received. Ultrapure water (resistivity >18 MΩ cm) was home-made in the laboratory.
TiO2 nanorod arrays were prepared using the classical synthetic method reported in ref. 35 and 36. In general, 0.6 mL TBOT was dropped into a solution of 15 mL HCl and 15 mL ultrapure water under strong stirring. Fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass substrates were washed by sonication in acetone, ethanol and ultrapure water in sequence and finally blown dry under nitrogen. The electrode part of FTO glass was screened with Teflon tape (working temperature: −30 °C to 500 °C). Four pieces of FTO glass were placed on polytetrafluoroethylene (Teflon) stent at a 45 degree angle against the wall of the Teflon autoclave with the conducting side facing down. The solution above was then transferred to a Teflon-sealed autoclave and FTO glass was immersed into the solution. After that, the sealed autoclave was heated at 150 °C in an electric oven for 12 h and then allowed to cool down slowly at room temperature. The adhesive tape was then removed and rinsed in acetone and ultrapure water. Lastly, the sample was air dried at 60 °C for 2 hours, and then calcinated by slowly heating in air to 500 °C for 2 hours.
Preparation of N-TiO2 photoanode
The obtained TiO2 nanorod arrays were annealed in a tube furnace under the flow of NH3 at 500 °C for different times. After the annealing, the surface of the obtained photoanodes were cleaned with N2 flow. The samples with different ammoniation annealing times were labelled as N-TiO2-30 min, N-TiO2-60 min, N-TiO2-120 min and the electrode with the best PEC performance was that of sample N-TiO2.
Preparation of Au–TiO2 photoanode
The TiO2 photoanodes were coated with gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) by physical vapor deposition (PVD). Firstly, the sample was coated for different sputter times using the magnetron sputtering system (Quorum/Q 150R) under 40 mA sputter current. Then, these TiO2 photoanodes above were thoroughly cleaned with N2 flow.
Preparation of Au/N-TiO2 photoanode
A similar process to that given above was used for surface decoration of Au NPs on ammoniated TiO2 nanoarrays (N-TiO2). The samples with different sputter times were labelled as Au/N-TiO2-60s, Au/N-TiO2-90s, Au/N-TiO2-120s and the electrode with the best PEC performance was that of sample Au/N-TiO2.
Characterization
The phase structures were analysed by X-ray diffractometry (XRD, D8 Advance, Bruker, Germany) with Cu-Kα radiation, 2θ ranging from 20 to 85°. The morphology of the samples was observed on a field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, S-4800, Hitachi, Japan) equipped with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis was carried out on a JEOL TEM-2100F machine at a voltage of 200 kV. The UV-visible absorbance spectra were obtained by using a scan UV-vis spectrophotometer (UV-3900, Hitachi) equipped with an integrating sphere, using BaSO4 as a reflectance sample. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were carried out using a spectrometer (Kalpha, Thermo, U.S.A) with a Al Kα radiation excitation source.
Electrochemical measurements
All the electrochemical measurements were performed in a standard three-electrode system in which the as-synthesized photoanodes served as the working electrode, platinum foil was used as the counter electrode, and Ag/AgCl in saturated KCl worked as the reference electrode, respectively. Potentials vs. Ag/AgCl were converted into potentials vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) according to the Nernst equation (ERHE = EAg/AgCl + 0.197 + 0.0591 × pH). The electrolyte was a 1 M KOH aqueous solution at pH 13.6 degassed by purging Ar gas for 30 min. The photoresponse was measured under the irradiation of sunlight simulated by a xenon lamp (PLS-FX300HU, Perfectlight, China) equipped with an AM1.5 filter and the power density of the light source was adjusted to 100 mW cm−2 using an optical power meter (PM100D + S425C, Thorlabs, USA). All the electrochemical measurements that required light were performed under the front illumination. Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were collected under the irradiation of simulated sunlight illumination, with the frequencies varying between 0.01 and 10000 Hz. The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was obtained using a 300 W xenon lamp with a monochromator (7IMU3021, SOFN Instruments, China).
Results and discussion
XRD patterns were first recorded to study the crystal structure of pristine TiO2, N-TiO2 and Au/N-TiO2 samples. The XRD patterns of all samples (Fig. 1) show the reflection characteristics of the FTO and rutile TiO2 phases, suggesting that rutile TiO2 grew on the FTO substrate. The representative diffraction peaks of TiO2 are centered at 2θ of 36.4° and 63.2°, which matches well with the (101) and (002) crystal planes of the rutile phase (JCPDS 88-1175), respectively. In addition, it is observed that the peak intensity of (101) is more pronounced than that of the other diffraction peaks in all samples, indicating that rutile TiO2 nanorods grow preferentially along the [001] direction. However, the peak intensity of (101) of the N doped sample become weaker than that of pristine TiO2, which reveals that the introduction of N suppresses the preferred growth of TiO2 nanorod arrays.37 Moreover, no distinct Au signal is observed after magnetron sputtering of Au with different sputtering times (60–120 s) (Fig. S1, ESI†), which may be due to the low Au loading amount.38

The morphology of the fabricated pristine TiO2, N-TiO2 and Au/N-TiO2 nanorod arrays were investigated by using SEM and TEM. As shown in Fig. S2(a–c) (ESI†), dense and uniform TiO2 nanorod arrays grow approximately vertically on the FTO substrate with an average length of ∼2 μm. It is worth pointing out that the vertically aligned and highly dense TiO2 nanorods could promote the electron transfer and light absorption during the PEC reaction. Under the observation at a higher magnification (Fig. S2(d), ESI†), it displays that the nanorod arrays possess a tetragonal cross-section shape as well as an average diameter of ∼150 nm. The tetragonal nanorod shape was also confirmed by TEM, as shown in Fig. S2(e) (ESI†). Furthermore, the corresponding HREM image (Fig. S2(f), ESI†) shows an obvious lattice spacing of 0.32 nm and 0.29 nm, which can be classified as the (110) and (001) crystal face of rutile TiO2. This result reveals that the pristine nanorod arrays are rutile TiO2. Fig. S3(a–d) (ESI†) and Fig. 2(a–c) present the SEM images of the TiO2 nanorod arrays doped with N (N-TiO2) and further loading with Au nanoparticles (Au/N-TiO2), respectively. Clearly, no obvious change in the morphology was observed after N doping and Au nanoparticles loaded as compared to that of the pristine TiO2. Additionally, the length and diameter of the nanorod arrays were almost unchanged after ammoniation treatment as well as vacuum sputtering. As the size of Au nanoparticles is extremely small, they cannot be clearly distinguished by SEM. Thus, TEM and HRTEM characterizations were carried out for Au/N-TiO2 sample. As shown in Fig. 1(d and e), it is confirmed that the Au nanoparticles were successfully loaded on the surface of TiO2 nanorods. The results also reveal that the ultra-small Au NPs with average diameter in the range of 2–4 nm are well-dispersed in the whole TiO2 nanorod rather than connecting together to form a thin film. The corresponding electron diffraction (SAED) pattern of the marked area of A in Fig. 2(e) present bright and sharp diffraction spots of rutile TiO2, indicating the highly crystalline nature of the TiO2 nanorods (Fig. 2(g)). Meanwhile, the Au nanoparticles and TiO2 matrix were also easily distinguished in the HRTEM images (Fig. 2(h and i)) due to differences in contrast. Furthermore, the enlarged images displayed two different periodic fringe spaces of 0.251 nm and 0.24 nm, which can be classified as the (101) and (111) crystal face of rutile TiO2 and cubic Au, respectively.38,39 The result clearly shows that Au NPs with exposed (111) crystal faces are in intimate contact with the TiO2 matrix. In addition, it is worth pointing out that the lattice fringe space of the (101) plane in the composite is slightly larger than that of pristine TiO2, which might be caused by N doping in the lattice.40 SEM and EDX analyses (Fig. S4 and Table S1, ESI†) further confirmed that Au NPs have been loaded on the surface of the N-TiO2 nanorod arrays. Trace amounts of Si may originate from FTO glass substrates. In order to further demonstrate element components and chemical states, X ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed for the pristine TiO2, N-TiO2 and Au/N-TiO2 samples. As shown in Fig. 3(a), the full XPS survey spectra of the Au/N-TiO2 sample revealed the presence of Ti, O, C, Si and Au while the pristine TiO2 and N-TiO2 show the absence of Au. The detected C and Si elements are caused by the adventitious hydrocarbons in the atmosphere and FTO conductive substrate, respectively. The N peak was not distinct in the XPS survey spectra of N-TiO2 and Au/N-TiO2, which may be due to the small amount of N doping. Thus, the N1s high-resolution XPS spectra of the Au/N-TiO2 sample is displayed in Fig. 3(c). Obviously, a distinct peak at 399.9 eV can be found in the sample, suggesting that N element has been introduced into the composite. The detected peak can be attributed to interstitial N, indicating that N atoms are doped in the TiO2 lattice in the interstitial sites.37,41–43Fig. 3(b) shows the Ti 2p high-resolution XPS spectra of pristine TiO2, N-TiO2 and Au/N-TiO2, both of which display two peaks centered at ∼464.8 and ∼464.8 eV belong to Ti 2p1/2 and Ti 2p3/2 of rutile TiO2, respectively. However, the binding energy of Ti 2p3/2 for Au/N-TiO2 show a slight positive shift as compared to that of pristine TiO2 (from 459.1 eV to 459.3 eV), which might be resulted from the charge transfer between the substrate material and the Au NPs.44,45 The Au 4f XPS survey spectra of Au/N-TiO2 are resolved into two single peaks of Au 4f5/2 and Au 4f7/2 cantered at 87.9 eV and 84.1 eV, respectively, which confirm the metallic state of Au.45

Fig. 4(a) shows the UV/Vis absorption spectra of the pristine TiO2, N-TiO2, Au–TiO2 and Au/N-TiO2 samples. For the pristine TiO2, the obvious steep absorption edge located at about 420 nm can be attributed to its intrinsic wide band gap (∼3.0 eV). However, the light absorption edge is extended to the visible-light range (ca. 550 nm) after introduction of N doping into TiO2 nanorod arrays. In addition, it is observed that there is a tail-up absorption at 700–800 nm in all samples, which may be assigned to light scattering caused by pores or cracks in the nanorod arrays.46,47 Fig. S5 (ESI†) shows the UV-Vis absorption spectra of pristine TiO2 and N-TiO2 with different ammoniation annealing times (30 minutes, 1 hour and 2 hours). Compared with the pristine TiO2, the band edge of the sample after ammoniation exhibits a red shift from 550 nm to 700 nm, which indicates that the samples after ammoniation show a certain light absorption in the visible light region. These results also prove that nitrogen doping is achieved after ammoniation, which is beneficial to promote the PEC performance of the electrode. It can also be seen that the absorption value of the sample after ammoniation for 1 hour is the highest in both visible and ultraviolet regions. Fig. S6 (ESI†) shows the UV-Vis absorption spectra of N-TiO2 and N-TiO2 modified with Au NPs by magnetron sputtering for different times (60 s, 90 s, and 120 s). As can be seen from the figure, all the samples modified with Au NPs have an absorption peak at about 550 nm, probably caused by the LSPR of Au NPs.48 Among them, the absorption intensity of Au/N-TiO2-90 s in the visible region is the strongest, while too many Au NPs will weaken the LSPR effect, thus weakening the absorption and utilization of light. It can be seen from the blue line in Fig. 4(a) that sample modified with only Au NPs (Au–TiO2) also has an absorption peak around 550 nm. From the red line in Fig. 4(a), for Au/N-TiO2, the absorption band edge shows a red shift to the visible light region. In addition, Au/N-TiO2 also has a strong absorption peak at about 550 nm due to the LSPR effect, which are beneficial to the light absorption of the photoelectrode and thus boost the PEC performance of the photoelectrode.

(b) The LSV curves of pristine TiO2, N-TiO2, Au–TiO2 and Au/N-TiO2 collected at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 and applied potentials from 0 to 1.6 V vs. RHE in 1 M aqueous KOH solution. (c) The chopped transient photocurrent density vs. time under 1.23 V vs. RHE. (d) The photocurrent-time profiles of pristine TiO2, N-TiO2, Au–TiO2 and Au/N-TiO2 photoanodes, measured at a potential of 1.23 V vs. RHE. 
The PEC performance of the sample photoanodes was investigated by measuring linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves in 1 M KOH aqueous solution. Fig. 4(b) and Fig. S7 (ESI†) show the LSV curves of the pristine TiO2, Au–TiO2, N-TiO2 and Au/N-TiO2 photoanodes. In the dark, the current densities are negligible for all sample photoanodes. Under simulated solar illumination, the photocurrent density is gradually increased as the bias is enhanced for all sample photoanodes, suggesting that they exhibit a typical photoresponse. For the pristine TiO2 photoanode, it shows a higher onset potential (Vonset) at 0.257 V vs. RHE and a relatively low photocurrent density of 0.4 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE. Obviously, upon introduction of the N dopant into TiO2, the Vonset is almost unchanged but the photocurrent density improves significantly. To optimize the N doped TiO2 photoanodes, the LSV curves of the N-TiO2 photoanodes obtained with different ammonization times were also studied (Fig. S8, ESI†). The N-TiO2 photoanodes with 1 hour ammoniation show the optimal photocurrent density of 0.75 mA cm−2, which is 1.9 times as high as that of pristine TiO2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE. As for the Au–TiO2 photoanode, it also presents a striking increase of photocurrent density (1 mA cm−2). Furthermore, it is observed that the Vonset of the Au–TiO2 photoanode is 0.213 V vs. RHE, which is much smaller than that of the pristine TiO2 photoanode. The result confirms that surface modification with Au NPs can not only improve the photocurrent density but also diminish the onset potential for PEC water splitting. The lower Vonset value means better carrier transport and consumption capabilities, and there will be less photogenerated hole accumulation on the photoanode surface under the same voltage, which facilitates photostability.49 Furthermore, when Au nanoparticles were loaded on the N doped TiO2 photoanodes, the corresponding Au/N-TiO2 photoanodes exhibited a considerably high photocurrent density of 2.8 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE, accompanied by a small onset potential (0.226 V). Significantly, the achieved photocurrent density of the Au/N-TiO2 photoanode shows more than 7-, 2.8- and 3.7-fold enhancement compared with the pristine TiO2, Au–TiO2 and N-TiO2 photoanodes, respectively, and higher than those of many other reported TiO2-based photoanodes (Table S2, ESI†). These results confirmed that N doping and Au nanoparticles loading provide a synergistic promotion effect of PEC efficiency of TiO2 nanorod arrays. The transient photocurrents were recorded at a fixed potential of 1.23 V vs. RHE with 50 s light on/off cycle (Fig. 4(c)). Upon illumination, the photocurrents of all sample photoanodes can rapidly reach a steady state and quickly revert to zero in the dark, indicating their excellent photoresponse. In addition, the comparison of photocurrent response values is in accordance with the LSV measurements and the Au/N-TiO2 photoanode shows the maximum jump photocurrent at 2.8 mA cm−2 (1.23 V vs. RHE) in almost all cycles. To further explore the photostability of the sample photoanodes, the photocurrent–time (I–t) curves of the four representative electrodes were collected at 1.23 V vs. RHE under continuous light of 7200 s. As shown in Fig. 4(d), the bare TiO2 and N-TiO2 photoanodes lost one third of their initial photocurrent, while the photocurrent densities of Au/N-TiO2 and Au–TiO2 remained relatively stable throughout the process, maintaining 96.8% and 99.3% of their initial current values. It is worth noting that the relatively poor photocurrent stability of the N-TiO2 photoanode was attributed to the fact that the impurity levels introduced by nitrogen might act as new recombination centres for photogenerated electron–hole pairs during long-time irradiation.50 The above results also reveal that surface modification with Au NPs could prolong the lifetime of the photogenerated carriers, which plays an important role in improving the photostability of the photoelectrode.
In order to further explore the relationship between PEC activity and optical absorption, the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiencies (IPCE) of four representative electrodes at 1.23 V vs. RHE are calculated through the formula (eqn (1)): (1)where Jph denotes the photocurrent density (mA cm−2), Pmono is the intensity of incident monochromatic light (mW cm−2) and λ refers to the wavelength of monochromatic light (nm). As shown in Fig. 5(a), the IPCE values of the four sample photoanodes in UV region between 300 and 400 nm are much higher than that in the visible region between 400 and 600 nm, which are in accordance with their UV-Vis absorption spectrum.51 Compared with the pristine TiO2, the IPCE values of all the modified samples have been significantly enhanced in the UV absorption region (300–400 nm). The highest IPCE of Au/N-TiO2 reached 60.7% at 300 nm, which is ∼7.1, ∼2.0 and 1.4 times higher than that of pristine TiO2 (∼8.53% at 360 nm), Au–TiO2 (∼30.7% at 300 nm) and N-TiO2 (∼44.5% at 300 nm), respectively. It is worth noting that photocurrent response of the pristine TiO2 sample is mainly located in the wavelength range of 300–420 nm, and decreases to almost zero above 400 nm. However, for Au–TiO2, N-TiO2 and Au/N-TiO2, the photocurrent response extends to the visible light range of 420–600 nm (the inset in Fig. 5(a)). For Au–TiO2 and Au/N-TiO2, the enhanced photon to electron conversion in the visible region of around 550 nm can be attributed to the LSPR effect in Au NPs. It is proved by experiment that N doping and surface modification of Au NPs can synergistically improve the PEC activity of the electrode in both UV and visible light regions. Furthermore, the improvement effect of N doping is better than that of Au NP modification in the UV region while the improvement effect of Au NP modification is better than that of N doping in the visible light region, which is consistent with the results of UV-visible spectroscopy (Fig. 4(a)).

The applied bias photon to current efficiency (ABPE) was also used for the quantitative evaluation of PEC water splitting efficiency, which was calculated by the following equation (eqn (2)),52 (2)in which Jph is the current density (mA cm−2) at the applied bias potential vs. RHE (Vbias), Pph denotes the irradiance intensity of 100 mW cm−2 (AM1.5G). Fig. 5(b) displays the relationship of the calculated ABPE of the four representative electrodes. Obviously, the Au/N-TiO2 photoanode exhibits the maximal ABPE value of 1.27% at 0.59 V vs. RHE, which is much higher than that of N-TiO2 (0.24% at 0.75 V vs. RHE), Au–TiO2 (0.54% at 0.54 V vs. RHE) and pristine TiO2 photoanode (0.14% at 0.77 V vs. RHE). These results also confirmed that the hole and electron injection barrier at the electrode/electrolyte interface is reduced induced by N doping and Au NP loading.5,53
The interfacial properties between the photoanodes and the electrolyte were further studied by EIS (Fig. 4(c)). The semicircle of the Nyquist plots represents the charge separation process and the radius of the semicircle corresponds to the charge-transfer resistance.9,54 It is obvious that Au/N-TiO2 shows the smallest radius in the Nyquist diagrams indicating the improved charge transport and transfer efficiency by the synergetic effect of N doping and decoration with Au NPs.51,55 The collected EIS are fitted using an equivalent circuit using ZSimpWin software, which is shown in the inset of Fig. 5(c). The equivalent circuit is composed of a constant phase element (CPE), the solution resistance (Rs), the surface state charge trapping resistance (Rtrap) and the charge-transfer resistance (Rct). The fitting values are given in Tables S3 (ESI†). It is clear that Au/N-TiO2 possesses the lowest Rs, Rtrap and Rct among the four photoanodes, in agreement with the observed PEC activity results.
To further explore the synergetic effects of nitrogen doping and decoration with Au NPs on the photoinduced charge and PEC performance of TiO2, the lock-in-based surface photovoltage spectroscopy (SPS) are measured on the sample photoanodes. The photovoltaic cell is an FTO/sample/FTO sandwich structure (inset below in Fig. 5(d)) and the results of SPS are shown in Fig. 5d. For the pristine TiO2, there is a strong positive SPS signal (the black line in Fig. 5(d)). Generally, the positive SPS signal suggests that the photoinduced holes transmit to the surface of photocatalysts and photoinduced electrons move to the bulk of photocatalysts, which is consistent with the upward band bending in n-type semiconductors.56,57 Compared with the pristine TiO2, the SPS signals of N-TiO2 (the magenta line in Fig. 5(d)) and Au–TiO2 (the blue line in Fig. 5(d)) are reduced clearly. This may be caused by the following reasons. On one hand, the nitrogen doped in TiO2 tends to be the new recombination centre of photoinduced electron–hole pairs.50 On the other hand, when Au NPs are loaded on the surface of TiO2, the hot electrons are generated by the LSPR effect of Au NPs, and the hot electrons are injected into the surface of TiO2. The holes that have migrated to the surface of TiO2 under the built-in electric field are combined with the electrons injected from Au NPs.45,58 As a result, the amount of net positive charge accumulated on the surface is reduced, and the positive signal is weakened (the blue line in Fig. 5(d)). Due to the cooperation of nitrogen doping and decoration with Au NPs, the signal intensity of Au/N-TiO2 is the weakest among the four samples (the red line in Fig. 5(d)). The above results clearly demonstrate the advantage of our structural design for obtaining excellent photoelectrochemical activities.
Based on above results, the enhancement mechanism of Au/N-TiO2 photoanode applied in PEC water splitting is discussed and proposed in Fig. 5(e). Firstly, 1D TiO2 nanorod arrays possess enlarged specific surface area and ultrahigh aspect ratio, which can provide a convenient way for photoinduced charge to transfer to the surface reactive sites and reduce the recombination of charge.59,60 Secondly, the photoanode of Au/N-TiO2 extends the absorption range of TiO2 from ultraviolet to visible light by nitrogen doping and LSPR effect of Au NPs, which is confirmed by UV-visible spectroscopy as discussed above. Then, the Au NPs act as a sensitizer, absorbing resonant photons and generating the energetic hot electrons from the process of the LSPR excitation. The hot electrons inject them into the conduction band of the adjacent N-TiO2, so that more electrons are involved in the hydrogen evolution reaction of the photoelectrochemical process. This is also confirmed by the above SPS test and analysis. Furthermore, the LSPR effect of Au NPs can provide a highly intensive localized electromagnetic fields, which can promote the generation and separation of photogenerated electron–hole pair of photoanodes in the visible light region, thereby improving the PEC activity of photoanodes. This can be confirmed by the above LSV and EIS results and the simulation results in some reported works.61 In brief, the present study reveals that the synergistic effect of N doping and decoration with Au NPs dramatically can significantly enhance the PEC activities of the TiO2 photoanode.
Conclusions
In summary, we have demonstrated the synthesis of N-doped TiO2 nanorod arrays decorated with plasmonic Au NPs for PEC water splitting applications by combining a hydrothermal method, ammoniation treatment and vacuum sputtering. The PEC measurements displayed that the obtained Au/N-TiO2 photoanode exhibits a remarkable photocurrent of 2.8 mA cm−2 at 1.23 vs. RHE, which increase more than 7-fold compared to the pristine TiO2 and surpass those of most TiO2 based photoanodes reported to date. Otherwise, as compared to the pristine TiO2 ones, the onset potential was decreased to about 0.031 V while the IPCE and ABPE values were also significantly improved from 8.53% to ∼60.7% and 0.25% to ∼1.27%, respectively. The improved performance is attributed to the synergistic effect from the N doping and surface modification with Au NPs, which can significantly promote the light utilization and charge separation of TiO2. The current work is of great significance to stimulate research in the rational application of advanced photoanodes for solar energy conversion applications.
