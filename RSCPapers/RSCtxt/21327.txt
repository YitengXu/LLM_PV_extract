It is shown that microstructurally engineered PbI2 thin films with porosity and low crystallinity are the most favorable for conversion into uniform-coverage, phase-pure α-HC(NH2)2PbI3 perovskite thin films. Planar perovskite solar cells fabricated using these thin films deliver power conversion efficiency (PCE) up to 13.8%.
The field of thin-film photovoltaics is experiencing a revolution with the recent rise of the perovskite solar cells (PSCs) that employ organolead trihalide perovskites (OTPs) as light absorbing materials.1–5 OTPs are a group of crystalline organic–inorganic hybrid materials with the chemical formula of APbX3 (A = CH3NH2+ or HC(CH2)2+; X = I−, Br− or Cl−).1–5 While the methylammonium lead triiodide (CH3NH3PbI3 or MAPbI3) perovskite is the most widely studied,1–5 the formamidinium lead triiodide (HC(NH2)2PbI3 or FAPbI3) perovskite, with broader light absorption, has been attracting increasing interest.6–17 Like MAPbI3, typical routes for depositing FAPbI3 perovskite thin films include one-step7,10,13 and sequential-deposition6,7,11 methods. The crystallization process of OTPs from the sequential-deposition route is based on the intercalation of the organic component into the layer-structured inorganic PbX6 octahedral framework, which has been investigated extensively in the context of the MAPbI3 perovskite.2,4,18 However, in comparison with MAPbI3, there are certain unique challenges for the intercalation–crystallization of high-quality FAPbI3 perovskite films, especially in the planar form. First, the ionic radius of the FA+ cation (2.79 Å) is larger than that of the MA+ cation (2.70 Å),19 and, thus, the intercalation of FA+ into the PbX6 octahedral framework is expected to be kinetically more difficult, which may result in some unreacted PbI2 residue. Second, compared with the monomorphic MAPbI3, FAPbI3 has two polymorphs at room temperature,7,20–22 the ‘yellow’ δ-FAPbI3 non-perovskite polymorph and the desirable ‘black’ α-FAPbI3 perovskite phase. The residual PbI2 and the formation of some δ-FAPbI3 phases accompanying the α-FAPbI3 crystallization in the thin film has been shown to degrade the solar cell performance.9 Thus, it becomes critically important to facilitate the complete conversion of PbI2 to α-FAPbI3, while suppressing the formation of δ-FAPbI3. The formation kinetics of OTPs in a sequential-deposition route is expected to depend strongly on the microstructure, viz. crystallinity and porosity, of the pre-deposited solid-PbI2 thin films. While this has been studied in the context of MAPbI3,18,23 there is a paucity of such studies in the case of FAPbI3. Here we have tailored the microstructure of the solid-PbI2 precursor thin films in terms of crystallinity and porosity characteristics, and studied their effect on the formation of FAPbI3. We show that by using porous PbI2 thin films with low crystallinity, phase-pure, dense α-FAPbI3 thin films can be obtained via stepwise conversion. Planar PSCs fabricated using these films exhibit PCEs up to 13.8%.
Four types of PbI2 thin films with tailored porosities and crystallinities—the important microstructural characteristics that govern the conversion to FAPbI3 thin films—are used in this study: (i) compact (dense), with low crystallinity (PbI2-CL), (ii) porous, with low crystallinity (PbI2-PL), (iii) porous, with high crystallinity (PbI2-PH), and (iv) compact, with high crystallinity (PbI2-CH). These PbI2 thin films are deposited using solution processing, and are subjected to post-deposition treatments to obtain the desired microstructural characteristics. The PbI2-CL film is a freshly spin-coated (4000 rpm, 40 s) film using a 40 wt% PbI2 precursor solution. The PbI2-PL and PbI2-PH films are obtained by aging the PbI2-CL film at room temperature for 2 h and 48 h, respectively. The PbI2-CH film is processed by heat-treating the PbI2-CL film at 150 °C for 1 h. Fig. 1A–D are scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images showing the top-view surface morphologies of these four films. It is readily apparent that the PbI2-CL and PbI2-CH films are dense, while the PbI2-PL and PbI2-PH films have similar porosities. The corresponding X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns are shown in Fig. 1E, specifically the characteristic PbI2 001 peak at ∼12.8°.24,25 The intensities of the peaks from the PbI2-CH and PbI2-PH films are more than twice as strong compared with those from PbI2-CL and PbI2-PL films, indicating relatively low crystallinity in PbI2-CL and PbI2-PL thin films. These tailored microstructural properties are closely related to the post-treatment conditions. The obvious porosity generation by going from PbI2-CL (freshly spin-coated) to PbI2-PL (2 h aging) is most likely related to the crystallinity enhancement, which causes an increase in the local density of the PbI2 and induces local shrinkage in the film. After further aging for 48 h at room temperature, the crystallinity increases, but significant grain growth does not occur due to the low temperature used here. However, this results in only a slight decrease in the porosity, as revealed in Fig. 2C. However, for the PbI2-CH film, the crystallinity enhancement and grain growth occur simultaneously due to the high annealing temperature (150 °C), resulting in the formation of a dense, highly crystalline microstructure.

 Fig. 2  XRD patterns of FAPbI3 thin films: (A) FAPbI3-CL, (B) FAPbI3-PL, (C) FAPbI3-PH, and (D) FAPbI3-CH converted from their corresponding solid-PbI2 precursor thin films. The sequential deposition method of ‘successive spin-coating/annealing’ is used for the film conversion. 
With the four PbI2 films deposited, an identical sequential processing procedure is adopted for their conversion to FAPbI3 films. The typical sequential deposition method used in this study is the ‘successive spin-coating/annealing’ as described in our previous reports.18,26 The experimental details are included in the ESI.† The FAI species are expected to intercalate into the solid PbI2 films during the multiple spin-coating/annealing cycles. In this method, the intercalation reaction is mainly driven by the solid-state reaction between PbI2 and FAI, which allows better control over the morphology of the final films.18,26Fig. 2 shows the XRD patterns of the resulting FAPbI3 films. In all four cases the formation of the α-FAPbI3 perovskite is observed. While different amounts of residual PbI2 are also present in three of the four resulting FAPbI3 films converted from the PbI2-CL (Fig. 2A), PbI2-PH (Fig. 2C), and PbI2-CH (Fig. 2D) films, only the FAPbI3-PL (Fig. 2B) film converted from the PbI2-PL film does not contain a detectable amount of residual PbI2. Thus, having porous PbI2 thin films of low crystallinity is of paramount importance for obtaining phase-pure α-FAPbI3 perovskite thin films in our sequential deposition process. It is interesting to note that the δ-FAPbI3 non-perovskite phase is absent in all four FAPbI3 thin films.
The infiltration of the FAI precursor in the porous PbI2-PL thin film and its subsequent intercalation into PbI2 is shown schematically in Fig. 3A. First, the interconnected porosity of the PbI2-PL thin film allows ready infiltration of the FAI precursor across the entire thickness of the film, which significantly shortens the FAI diffusion path into the interior of the PbI2 thin film. Second, a more disordered PbI2 structure (lower crystallinity) at the pore-walls provides abundant active sites for the reaction with FAI and its intercalation (this is reminiscent of Li-ion intercalation into porous intercalation-based anode materials in Li-ion batteries27,28).

(C) Evolution of the absorption spectra during its intercalation crystallization process based on the PbI2-PL thin film. Note that the XRD patterns and the absorption spectra at the “intermediate stage 1” and “intermediate stage 2” correspond to the intermediate films after one and two spin coating/annealing cycle(s), respectively. (D) Cross-sectional SEM images of the PbI2-PL thin film (left) and the as-formed FAPbI3-PL thin film (right) after complete intercalation of FAI into the PbI2-PL film. 
In order to further elucidate the intercalation crystallization process of the pure FAPbI3 phase, XRD patterns from the films after each spin-coating/annealing cycle are presented in Fig. 3B. The corresponding top-view SEM images at each stage are shown in the inset of Fig. 3B. The XRD patterns show simultaneous decrease in the amount of PbI2 and an increase of the amount of α-FAPbI3 in the films, which is indicative of stepwise intercalation crystallization of α-FAPbI3 with spin-coating/annealing cycles. Phase-pure α-FAPbI3 forms after three spin-coating/annealing cycles. Some undesirable δ-FAPbI3 is detected after the first spin-coating/annealing cycle. However, it disappears in the subsequent cycle, leaving only α-FAPbI3 and PbI2 in the film, which is most likely the result of δ → α transformation in this planar film (note that such facile δ → α transformation is retarded when the FAPbI3 layer is deposited upon a high-surface-area mesoporous TiO2 scaffold29). This suggests that the major challenge in the sequential-deposition of FAPbI3 is the intrinsic sluggish diffusion of large-sized FAI molecules into the layered PbI2 structure. Therefore, the porous and the low-crystallinity microstructural characteristics of the PbI2 thin film are key to effective FAI infiltration and intercalation, as depicted in Fig. 3A. To further support the XRD results, the absorption spectra of the film at the end of each spin-coating/annealing cycle are presented in Fig. 3C. The starting film shows the typical absorption feature of PbI2.18,30 With increasing number of spin-coating/annealing cycles, a clear absorption edge for FAPbI36–16 at ∼820 nm evolves, while a mixed absorption feature is observed after one and two spin-coating/annealing cycles.

Fig. 3D compares the cross-sectional SEM images of the PbI2-PL thin film and the converted α-FAPbI3 thin film (FAPbI3-PL). A thin-layer porous planar structure with a thickness of ∼220 nm is readily seen in the PbI2-PL thin film. After conversion to phase-pure α-FAPbI3, the film becomes dense, with a uniform thickness of ∼280 nm, an expansion of ∼27%. Since the densities of PbI2 and α-FAPbI3 are 6.16 g cm−3 and 4.101 g cm−3,21,30 respectively, the complete intercalation–crystallization of α-FAPbI3 from a fully-dense PbI2 thin film will result in a ∼50% expansion of the thickness (assuming full in-plane constraints31). This is another benefit of the porosity in the PbI2-PL thin film, which partially accommodates the volume expansion for better control over the morphology of the final perovskite thin film and preventing cracking/delamination.30
PSCs are then fabricated from the FAPbI3-CL, FAPbI3-PL, FAPbI3-PH and FAPbI3-CH thin films with a spiro-OMeTAD as the hole-transporting material (HTM) and a compact TiO2 as the electron-transporting layer (ETL), with fluorinated tin oxide (FTO) and Ag as electrodes on either side. Typical photocurrent density (J)–voltage (V) characteristics of these four PSCs are plotted in Fig. 4A, and the performance parameters are presented in the inset table. It is clear that the PSC performance shows clear dependency on the phase purities of the as-deposited α-FAPbI3 thin films. Typical efficiencies of the PSCs using FAPbI3-CL, FAPbI3-PL, FAPbI3-PH and FAPbI3-CH films are 9.7%, 12.2%, 9.9% and 7.7%, respectively. The integrated short-circuit photocurrent density (JSC) values from EQE spectra of these PSCs (Fig. 4B) are consistent with those from the J–V measurements (Fig. 4A). The major improvements of the phase-pure perovskite lie in higher JSC and VOC, indicating efficient charge generation/transport and a better perovskite/ETL junction for the completely converted FAPbI3. The highest PCE is achieved using the FAPbI3-PL thin film (made from the PbI2-PL thin film), which contains the phase-pure α-FAPbI3 perovskite. Through further optimization of the thickness of the FAPbI3 thin films to ∼320 nm, the highest attainable PCE is 13.8%, as shown in Fig. 5A. The EQE integrated JSC is 20.23 mA cm−2, which is consistent with the JSC of 20.4 mA cm2 from the J–V measurements. The stabilized power conversion efficiency at the maximum power point is ∼12.8%. The overall performance of the as-fabricated FAPbI3-based PSCs is still not beyond the state-of-the-art PSCs reported by Yang et al.,7 which could be related to several factors (e.g. the grain size/crystallinity,32 mesoporous TiO2 insertion,25 selection of charge-extraction layers,3etc.) that influence the cell performance. Further optimization of these parameters is under investigation.

Conclusions
We have shown that the microstructure of solid-PbI2 precursor thin films plays a key role in the intercalation–crystallization of FAPbI3 thin films. Porous PbI2 thin films with low crystallinity are the most favourable for the formation of a phase-pure ‘black’ α-FAPbI3 perovskite, which is due to facile infiltration and diffusion of FAI precursors into the porous PbI2 thin films. The porosity in the PbI2 thin films also partially accommodates the volume expansion associated with the conversion of PbI2 into FAPbI3. Up to 13.8% PCE is obtained in PSCs based on phase-pure α-FAPbI3 thin films crystallized from porous, low-crystallinity PbI2 thin films. This study highlights the importance of the solid-PbI2 precursor thin-film microstructure in the sequential-deposition routes for the processing of FAPbI3 perovskite thin films, and provides guidelines for the development of high-efficiency FAPbI3-based PSCs. These could be extended to other perovskite photovoltaic materials and their variants (e.g. δ-CsSnI3, α-CsPbI3, and Cs2SnI6).
