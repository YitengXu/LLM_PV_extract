    , Accepted 12th September 2018First published on 13th September 2018AbstractA series of terrylene diimides (TDIs), the higher homologues of perylene diimides (PDI), were designed, synthesized and characterized in this work. In comparison to the bare TDI molecule, the bay-functionalized dyes, ph-TDI and th-TDI, possess enhanced ambipolar properties as well as organic solar cell performance.
Among the investigated organic materials, rylene diimides combining p-type rylene aromatic cores with strong electron-withdrawing diimide substitutes appear to be one of the most promising n-type semiconductors, especially perylene diimides (PDI).1a,b These PDI derivatives have received considerable attention in dye chemistry, supramolecular assemblies, and optoelectronic applications. The higher homologues of PDIs with extended π systems in the series of rylene diimides, terrylene diimides (TDIs), have similar outstanding properties to PDI molecules, such as excellent photochemical stabilities and strong intermolecular interactions resulting in ordered supramolecular structures and high charge carrier mobilities.2a–c Furthermore, TDIs simultaneously possess a good absorption ability in the near infrared (NIR) region, higher fluorescence quantum yields, a higher tendency to π–π stacking and multiple functionalization positions.2c These characteristics endow TDIs with a diversity of chemical structures and great application potential as n-type semiconductors.
Generally, monochrome PDI dyes show a severe aggregation tendency, which is not good for their use as electron acceptors in organic solar cells.3a–e Being the higher homologues of PDIs, the molecular packing of monochrome TDIs can be improved by similar optimization methods for PDIs via core-extension or imide functionalization in the TDI core so as to improve the n-type performance.1b,4a–c Core functionalization of TDIs includes ortho- and bay-position modification, namely 2,5,10,13- and 1,6,9,14-positions, respectively (Scheme 1).5a–d According to previous literature, ortho-functionalization preserves the planarity of the TDI core, forming a microstructure with large aggregates and pronounced domain boundaries as the charge traps, which are not good for the charge transport.6 Müllen reported two TDI derivatives via cyanation of the ortho- and bay-positions in TDI and reported that the bay-functionalized compound exhibited an enhanced n-type average mobility of 0.17 cm2 V−1 s−1 when compared to the ortho-functionalized TDI.6 Based on this theory and learning from the design strategy for PDI molecules, we have reported two twisted TDI derivatives, namely TDI2 and BTDI3, and investigated their application in polymer solar cells. The corresponding solar cells showed low open-circuit voltages (VOCs) of 0.6–0.7 V, inhibiting the power conversion efficiency (PCE) improvement for organic solar cells (OSCs).7
 Scheme 1  Synthetic routes to ph-TDI and th-TDI. 
Herein, we investigate for the first time the effect of electron-rich units on the TDI's optoelectronic, charge transport and photovoltaic properties. The introduction of electron-donating groups greatly enhances the electron delocalization and the twisting degree in the TDI core, providing the molecules with a broadened absorption range due to the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) effect,8a,b as well as a favourable morphology in the solid film. As a result, both their field-effect transistors and solar cells exhibit interesting properties. We hypothesize that the insertion of aromatic subunits into the TDI core can be an efficient strategy for altering the TDI aggregation effect, improving the morphology and providing interesting properties to devices. Furthermore, the TDI skeleton is a promising building-block for constructing non-fullerene acceptors with a near-infrared light response.
The synthetic routes to ph-TDI and th-TDI are shown in Scheme 1. The TDI molecule was synthesized according to the literature.9 In addition, the tetrabromo-TDI (4Br-TDI) was prepared by using the procedures reported in ref. 5a. Ph-TDI and th-TDI were obtained in a high yield of 92% and 81%, respectively by a simple one-pot procedure from the readily available precursor 4Br-TDI. Ph-TDI and th-TDI compounds have good solubility in common organic solvents, such as chloroform, tetrahydrofuran and o-dichlorobenzene at room temperature. NMR characterization and high resolution mass spectroscopy (HRMS) studies for all the above-mentioned chemicals are provided in the ESI.†
The optimized geometries of TDI, ph-TDI and th-TDI were calculated by adopting the density functional theory (DFT) at the B3LYP/6-31G (d,p) level. As shown in Fig. 1 and S1,† the parent TDI subunit appears to have a completely planar conformation, favoring the formation of strong π–π stacking and serious aggregation, while the introduction of the phenyl or thiophene unit significantly increases the twisting degree of the TDI core. For the ph-TDI molecule, owing to the steric encumbrance effect between phenyl groups and the neighbouring hydrogen atoms, the TDI core is found to be markedly nonplanar with a modest distortion degree between two adjacent naphthalene fragments. The substitution of thiophene groups in the bay-positions endows th-TDI with a crooked-belt shaped core. According to the literature, the nonplanar conformation could increase the solubility of ph-TDI and th-TDI molecules, guaranteeing the device processability.

To investigate the influence of electron-rich substitutes on the aggregation and optoelectronic properties, the UV-vis absorption spectra of TDI, ph-TDI and th-TDI in solution and thin films were measured (Fig. 2). The TDI dilute solution displayed three typical TDI core absorption bands and strong absorption from 500 to 700 nm with maximum absorption at 651 nm and a maximum molar extinction coefficient of 1.31 × 105 M−1 cm−1. With the introduction of electron-donating groups, the conjugation between the TDI core and four substituent groups was extended. In consequence, the absorption maxima of ph-TDI and th-TDI solutions were red-shifted to 703 and 730 nm, respectively. Obviously, the maximum molar extinction coefficients of ph-TDI and th-TDI were reduced, which is attributed to the weakened coplanarity in the TDI core. From the UV-vis absorption spectra in films, the absorption edges of compounds TDI, ph-TDI and th-TDI exhibited significant red-shifts by 106, 37, 46 nm, respectively, in contrast to their solution absorption. These results demonstrated that the aggregation tendency of TDI was suppressed significantly due to the introduction of additional substitutes in bay-positions.

The electrochemical properties of TDI, ph-TDI and th-TDI compounds in films were identified by cyclic voltammetry (CV) in acetonitrile/0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (Bu4NBF4) solution. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and LUMO values of TDI, ph-TDI and th-TDI films were calculated from the onset oxidation and reduction potentials, respectively (Fig. S3†). The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the TDI film were −3.78 and −5.61 eV, respectively, assuming that the Fc/Fc+ had an absolute energy level of −4.80 eV to vacuum. With the introduction of electron-donating groups, the LUMO and HOMO energy levels of TDI derivatives were shifted to −3.75/−5.57 eV for ph-TDI and −3.89/−5.49 eV for th-TDI, respectively. A slight variation of energy levels between TDI and ph-TDI was observed due to the weak electron affinity of phenyl in the bay-position. Nevertheless, the strong electron rich character of the thiophene substituents resulted in a higher HOMO energy level of th-TDI compared to the pristine TDI molecule, and therefore led to the narrowed band gap of th-TDI.
The charge transport properties of TDI dyes were determined by using OFET devices with a bottom gate-bottom contact (BGBC) configuration and the corresponding results are shown in Fig. S3 and Table S1.† The molecules were dissolved in CHCl3/o-hexane (10%, v/v) to prepare thin films via spin coating. The detailed charge mobilities of the three molecules are summarized in Table 1. The bare TDI molecule has an electron mobility of 7.3 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1. The TDI film also performed p-type transport with a hole mobility of 1.5 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. The ambipolar properties of TDI in our work were similar to the reported work.10 The core-extended TDI dyes also exhibited ambipolar transport with enhanced electron and hole mobilities. The Ph-TDI thin film provided high electron and hole mobilities of 0.028 and 0.023 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. Such values were comparable to the highest n-type mobilities measured for the bay-functionalized TDI, b-CN-TDI as-cast.6 Meanwhile, the thiophene extended TDI also had higher electron and hole mobilities of 0.012 and 0.0055 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The relationship between the morphology and field-effect mobility was investigated by atomic force microscopy (AFM) (Fig. S4†). The neat film of TDI had a bigger aggregate size and rougher surface with a mean-square surface roughness (Rq) of 3.79 nm. These distinct grain boundaries between the aggregates act as serious trapping sites for charge carriers and eventually result in a poor field-effect response, whereas the ph-TDI and th-TDI neat films exhibit a smoother and more uniform surface with many fibrillar structures and a Rq of 0.37 and 0.51 nm, respectively. These results revealed that the core-extended TDIs at the bay-position possess a suppressed aggregate size and an increased field-effect response.

Considerable literature has reported the influence of bay-functionalization of TDIs on the electronic and chemical properties. However, there have been few reports about the application of TDI derivatives in the photovoltaic field until the present moment. Therefore, we selected a commercial polymer material, PBDB-T with a wide band gap as an electron donor to investigate the application of near-infrared bay-functionalized TDIs on OSCs. First, the mass ratio of PBDB-T and TDI in chlorobenzene (CB) solvent was varied to optimize the device performance with the inverted device architecture of ITO/ZnO (30 nm)/BHJ/MoOx (10 nm)/Al, and ZnO and MoOx used as electron and hole transport electrodes, respectively. The detailed device parameters are summarized in Table S2.† Initially, by employing PBDB-T as an electron donor, the solar cells based on ph-TDI and th-TDI as electron acceptors showed PCEs of 3.36% and 3.15%, respectively, higher than 1.62% for PBDB-T:TDI as a control device. To further optimize the device parameters, we used 1-chloronaphthalene (1-CN) as a solvent additive and found that the device performance was enhanced to 4.43% and 3.50% for ph-TDI and th-TDI, respectively. Meanwhile, we selected an environmentally friendly solvent o-xylene as a host solvent and 1-CN as a solvent additive to optimize the active layer and the device parameters are shown in Table S3.† The optimized device with 3% 1-CN based on PBDB-T:ph-TDI exhibited the highest PCE of 5.10%, with a VOC of 0.938 V, a short-circuit current (JSC) of 11.10 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 0.490. The device for PBDB-T:th-TDI with 3% 1-CN had a PCE of 4.12% (see Table 2). The characteristic current density–voltage (J–V) curves and the corresponding external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra for the optimized devices are shown in Fig. 3. The variation of PCEs between ph-TDI and th-TDI based solar cells was mainly ascribed to the difference in VOC derived from the variation of LUMO energy levels. It should be noted that the solar cells based on th-TDI had higher VOC values than those based on TDI, despite the lower LUMO energy level for the th-TDI acceptor. It is supposed that other reasons beyond the variation of LUMO energy levels should be considered for the improvement of ph-TDI and th-TDI based devices. From the morphology of the neat film, the insertion of additional electron-donating groups into bay-positions is of great importance to the morphology and charge transport.

Thus, we investigated the morphologies of the blend films. First, the charge carrier mobilities of different blend films under optimized conditions were measured according to the space charge limited current (SCLC) method. From Table S4 and Fig. S5,† it was found that all of the blend films exhibited high hole mobilities in the order of magnitude of 10−4. Meanwhile, the ph-TDI and th-TDI blend films have similar electron mobilities in the order of magnitude of 10−5. However, the TDI blend film had a ridiculously low electron mobility of 10−8 cm2 V−1 s−1. Compared to both PBDB-T:ph-TDI and PBDB-T:th-TDI blend films, the extremely unbalanced μh/μe value in the PBDB-T:TDI film was not beneficial for JSC and FF, as well as VOC, due to the serious recombination.11a–e Hence, we carried out transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements to investigate the bulk morphologies of PBDB-T:TDI, PBDB-T:ph-TDI and PBDB-T:th-TDI blend films. As shown in Fig. 4a–c, the blend films of PBDB-T:TDI, PBDB-T:ph-TDI and PBDB-T:th-TDI processed with o-xylene and 1-CN co-solvents had very different phase separation morphologies in the bulk. The PBDB-T:TDI film had a large phase separation degree and a large phase size, as well as a reduction of the D–A interfacial area, whereas PBDB-T:ph-TDI and PBDB-T:th-TDI active layers had uniform phase separation combined with fiber-like structures. This was ascribed to the fact that twisted TDI molecules have good compatibility with polymer donor PBDB-T. The favorable phase separation and domain size would be helpful for charge separation and transfer due to the appropriate D–A interfacial area. These results indicated that the uniform phase separation and balanced electron and hole mobility promoted the enhancement of PCE as well as VOC for ph-TDI and th-TDI based solar cells.

Conclusions
In summary, a family of TDI derivatives via bay-functionalization with different substituents has been synthesized and investigated. Owing to the variation of electron donating properties between phenyl and thiophene substitutes, the ph-TDI and th-TDI exhibit different electrochemical and device properties. The introduction of thiophene groups with strong electron-donating properties into the TDI core has drastically broadened the absorption spectrum to the NIR region due to the enhanced ICT effect. Both nonplanar ph-TDI and th-TDI have enhanced ambipolar properties with higher hole and electron mobilities due to the favorable grain boundaries and domains in films. Environmentally friendly solution processed solar cells based on ph-TDI provide a high PCE of 5.10%. These results indicate that our design by incorporating different aromatic subunits into the TDI skeleton is efficient to adjust the absorption spectra and the charge transport properties and provide interesting device performance. Consequently, the targeted engineering of designing terrylene diimides with higher molar extinction coefficients and controlling the active layer morphology will be explored to further improve the photovoltaic properties in the near future.
