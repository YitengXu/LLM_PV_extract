    , Accepted 3rd January 2014First published on 8th January 2014AbstractIn this paper, we report a novel selective laser sintering of TiO2 nanoparticle (Degussa P25) film on plastic conductive substrates for highly efficient flexible dye-sensitized solar cell (DSC) applications. The so-called “selective sintering” means that the absorbed laser energy can effectively promote the electrical contacts between the TiO2 nanoparticles, but does not cause damage to the plastic conductive substrate. The choice of the near-infrared (wavelength = 1064 nm) laser source is critical for the effectiveness of the laser sintering. The laser sintering technology can effectively decrease electron transport resistance and increase recombination resistance of the TiO2 nanoparticle film characterized by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and transient photovoltage/photocurrent decay measurements, resulting in much improved charge collection efficiency. Thus, compared to the reference sample, the laser sintered film has achieved an improved short-circuit current density from 9.2 to 10.4 mA cm−2, fill factor from 0.71 to 0.77, and solar conversion efficiency from 4.5% to 5.7%. The fast and effective selective laser sintering technique has great potential to be integrated into scalable roll-to-roll manufacturing of highly efficient flexible DSCs.
Introduction
Flexible manufacturing of thin film solar cells is an important trend in today's photovoltaic market. Many innovation companies, e.g. G24 Innovations in UK, United Solar, Nanosolar, First Solar in the US, etc., have engaged in competitions in order to realize large-scale industrialization of thin film solar cells on flexible metal foils or plastic conductive substrates.1–4 In comparison to conventional rigid devices, flexible solar cells possess the following advantages: (1) their light weight and flexible features make them more suitable as portable power sources; (2) they are easily adapted to complex surfaces, such as diverse building roofs and curtain walls, facilitating the future “Building Integrated Photovoltaics” applications; (3) their compatibility with roll-to-roll manufacturing methods further strengthens the low-cost advantage, greatly reducing the energy payback time.1
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs), one of the most promising next generation photovoltaic technologies, and their flexible manufacturing have also attracted intensive attention from both academic and industrial researchers.5,6 Flexible substrates could be metal foils/meshes or conductive plastic films, such as indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated polyethylene terephthalate (PET) or ITO-coated polyethylene naphthalate (PEN). Metal foils or meshes have their own advantages for flexible DSC applications. The research in this field recently has made considerable progress.7–11 However, the nontransparent metallic substrates require back-side illumination, and the undesired light absorption by the counter electrode and the electrolyte will always constitute limitation factors for this kind of solar cell. In this work, we focus on flexible DSCs on conductive plastic substrates. The current efficiency records for plastic substrate-based flexible DSCs are about 7–8%, somewhat lower than 11–12% of the conventional DSCs on rigid FTO glasses.12,13 Such an efficiency gap mostly arises from elimination of the high temperature (450–550 °C) sintering procedure for TiO2 nanoparticle film, which can be done for film deposited on FTO glasses but cannot on plastic substrates. The widely used ITO-PET or ITO-PEN plastic substrates can only endure thermal treatment below 120 or 150 °C. Within such a low temperature range, how to improve the necessary inter-nanoparticle physical/electrical contacts, and therefore the effective charge collection capability for the photo-injected electrons, is of great significance for the cell performance.14,15 Up to now, though various low temperature techniques have been explored, including compression,16 UV-ozone treatment,17 microwave sintering,18 chemical sintering,19,20 and lift-off/transfer method,21etc., a facile and effective technique applicable to industrial production still remains a great challenge.
A cold isostatic press method was invented by Prof. Yi-Bing Cheng,22,23 one of the co-authors of this paper, to prepare highly uniform and robust TiO2 nanoparticle films on plastic conductive substrates. The technology has been well reproduced in our laboratory. In this paper, on the basis of the decent benchmark cell prepared by cold isostatic pressing, we further introduced a novel selective laser (wavelength = 1064 nm) sintering technique to post-treat the TiO2 nanoparticle film on the plastic conductive substrate. The fast laser treatment allows sufficient sintering of the binder-free TiO2 nanoparticle film without damage to the ITO/PEN substrate. A remarkable efficiency of 5.7% has been finally achieved. It is the first time the near-infrared (IR) laser has been introduced to fabricate flexible DSCs, different from previous reports mostly with UV lasers.24–26 In comparison to recently reported work by using a near-IR lamp to fast sinter TiO2 film on Ti foil,27 the laser spectrum is nearly single wavelength; therefore, the reaction of the laser beam on different materials will have more definite modes, which is very important for the selectivity of energy absorption by the TiO2 layer and the ITO/PEN layer. In addition, the laser sintering effect on the TiO2 film and the inherent relation with the performance of the solar cell device have been studied in detail.
Experimental section
Preparation of TiO2 films and flexible DSCs
The TiO2 film was prepared on an cold isostatic press according to the literature.22,23 Typically, a binder free paste consisting of 3.0 g TiO2 nanoparticles (Degussa, P25) in 7.0 g ethanol was prepared by ball-milling at rotating speed of 350 rpm for 4 h. Then, the paste was processed into a uniform film by a doctor blade technique on ITO-/PEN substrate (14 Ω cm−2, Peccell Technologies, Inc., Japan). Cold isostatic compression was carried out at the oil pressure of 200 MPa for 5 min. After that, robust TiO2 film with good adhesion to the substrate was achieved. The film thickness was controlled at 13 μm.
The pressed film was then treated by selective laser sintering on a computer controlled laser system with a 1064 nm laser source, as schematically shown in Fig. 1a. The TiO2 film was placed on top of the 3-dimensional working table. The laser power (P) was set at 8 W. The focus of the laser beam was set 14 mm above the TiO2 film. The effective irradiation area of the laser beam on the TiO2 film surface was a circular spot with a diameter (d) of 368 μm, as shown in Fig. 1b. The energy density (H) for the laser beam reaching the TiO2 film surface was estimated to be 52 J cm−2, according to the equation H = P/(V × d).26 The scanning trace is shown in Fig. 1c: by a reciprocating motion with the repeating length of at least 6 mm and scan line intervals of 250 μm, a designed pattern of laser sintered film could be obtained. The scanning rate (V) was set at 30 mm s−1. In such a way, it requires only 5 seconds to finish a size of 6 × 6 mm2 pattern sintering. After laser sintering, the adhesion force between the TiO2 film and the flexible substrate is still good (see the video in the ESI†).

For solar cell fabrication, the TiO2 films were then soaked in 0.5 mM N719 dye solution in a mixture of tert-butanol and acetonitrile (1:1, by volume) for 18 h at room temperature. The dyed films were then sealed with platinized counter electrodes by using Surlyn films (25 μm, DuPont) as spacers. The sandwich type solar cells were completed by filling liquid electrolyte through the drilled holes. The electrolyte consists of 1.0 M 1,3-dimethylimidazolium iodide, 50 mM LiI, 30 mM I2, 0.5 M tert-butylpyridine, and 0.1 M guanidinium thiocyanate in a mixed solvent of acetonitrile and valeronitrile (85:15, by volume).
Characterization
The morphology of TiO2 films was examined by using scanning electron microscopy (SEM, FEI-Sirion 200, FEI) and scanning probe microscopy (SPM, Nanoscope Multimode/Dimension, Digital Instruments Inc.). The film thickness was determined by a Veeco Dektak 150 surface profiler. Raman spectroscopy was carried out with a WITec confocal Raman microscope (alpha 300R).28 The excitation source was a 532 nm laser (2.33 eV) with a laser power below 0.1 mW on the sample to avoid laser-induced local heating. The laser spot size at focus was around 500 nm in diameter with a 100× objective lens (NA = 0.95). The spectral resolution was 1 cm−1.
The solar cell performances were evaluated using a solar simulator (100 mW cm−2, the equivalent of one sun at AM1.5G). A 450 W xenon light source solar simulator (Oriel, model 9119) with AM1.5G filter (Oriel, model 91192) was used to give an irradiance of 100 mW cm−2 at the surface of the solar cell. The current–voltage characteristics of the cell under these conditions were obtained by applying external potential bias to the cell and measuring the generated photocurrent with a Keithley model 2400 digital source meter (Keithley, USA). A similar data acquisition system was used to control the IPCE measurement. A white light bias (1% sunlight intensity) was applied onto the sample during the IPCE measurements with ac mode (10 Hz). The active area for solar cell testing determined by the square mask was 4 × 4 mm2.
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were performed using the PGSTAT302N frequency analyzer from Autolab (Ecochemie B.V., Utrecht, The Netherlands) together with the Frequency Response Analyzer module providing voltage modulation in the desired frequency range. The Z-view software (v2.8b, Scribner Associates Inc.) was used to analyze the impedance data. The EIS experiments were performed at a constant temperature of 25 °C in the dark. The impedance spectra of the series devices were recorded at potentials varying from −0.4 V to −0.8 V at frequencies ranging from 0.01 Hz to 200 KHz, the oscillation potential amplitudes being adjusted to 10 mV.
For the transient photovoltage/photocurrent decay measurements,29,30 a white light bias on the DSC sample was generated from an array of diodes. Red light pulse diodes (0.05 s square pulse width, 100 ns rise and fall time) controlled by a fast solid-state switch were used as the perturbation source. The voltage dynamics were recorded on a PC-interfaced Keithley 2602A source meter with a 100 μs response time. The perturbation light source was set to a suitably low level in order for the voltage decay kinetics to be monoexponential. By varying the white light bias intensity, the recombination rate constant and electron diffusion rate constant could be estimated over a range of applied biases.
Results and discussion
At the laser sintering conditions, it was found the TiO2 film could be effectively sintered which will be described in later sections, whilst the ITO/PEN plastic substrate remained unchanged in terms of sheet resistance and optical transparency before and after laser sintering (Fig. S1†). The selectivity of the sintering effect on the TiO2 film and the ITO/PEN substrate is suggested to arise from different light absorption of each layer (Fig. S2†). The TiO2 layer, rather than the ITO and PEN layers, absorbs the main part of the laser energy, and as a result, the highest temperature rise should occur in such a TiO2 layer. Besides, the choice of the laser wavelength of 1064 nm was important for the sintering effect of the TiO2 film. For a similar laser sintering setup but with a UV laser source (355 nm), it was found that the laser energy was only strongly absorbed within an ultrathin (100–200 nm) top layer of the TiO2 film, as a result of which a heavily melted dense top layer was formed (Fig. S3†). Such a layer capping the nanoparticle underlayer would block electrolyte diffusion and therefore hinder the solar cell performance. In marked contrast, the near IR laser has higher optical penetration length in the TiO2 film which can result in more homogenous and mild sintering effect across the whole film depth. That is because the near-infrared light absorption by the TiO2 film, associated with intra band-gap energy levels related to oxygen vacancies,31 is relatively weak in comparison to indirect inter-band photon absorption of UV light.

Fig. 2a shows a cold isostatic pressed TiO2 film on an ITO/PEN flexible substrate. It is optically semi-transparent, reflecting the dense packing of nanoparticles after compression.22,23 Inside the film, there are three laser sintered patterns indicated by the red arrows (square, circle and triangle). These patterns which are more opaque can be clearly identified from the base film. The general thinking at this point is: could it be a change of film morphology leading to suchan optical difference between the laser sintered regions and the base film? However, when we carefully checked both regions by SEM and SPM (Fig. 2b and c), no microstructure difference could be detected. The SPM tested mean roughnesses are 9.597 nm and 10.371 nm before and after laser sintering. Therefore, we strongly suspect there must be other reasons responsible for the optical change.

We then turned to Raman micro-spectroscopy to characterize the laser sintering effect on the TiO2 (P25) film. The results are shown in Fig. 3. It is known that P25 nanoparticles consist of about 80% anatase and 20% rutile phase.32 That is confirmed in Fig. 3a: for the unsintered film, the peaks at 144, 197, 399, 515, 519 (superimposed with the 515 cm−1 band), and 639 cm−1 owing to anatase phase dominate the Raman spectrum. Those peaks can be attributed to the six Raman-active modes of the anatase phase with symmetries of Eg, Eg, B1g, A1g, B1g, and Eg, respectively.33 The Raman peaks owing to the rutile phase at 235 cm−1, 445 cm−1 and 612 cm−1 correspond to two-phonon scattering, Eg, and A1g modes respectively.33 Those peaks are very weak in the unsintered film, however they increase evidently after laser sintering. The result strongly suggests the increase of rutile phase in the laser sintered film. That is to say, undergoing laser sintering, a considerable fraction of anatase phase in the P25 film is transformed into rutile phase. The Raman mapping on the interface between the sintered and unsintered regions clearly shows this point. Fig. 3c shows the Raman mapping results, of which the detected area corresponds to the red square region in Fig. 3b. From the optical micrographs of Fig. 3 b a clear interface between the left sintered region and the right unsintered region can be clearly found in the middle, according to their obvious brightness contrast. From Fig. 3c, this interface could also be identified according to the contrasts of the integrated intensities of Raman signals between the laser sintered and unsintered regions. The Raman signals owing to anatase phase (100–180 cm−1 and 490–565 cm−1) in the left sintered region are much higher than the right unsintered region; while the Raman signals owing to rutile phase (420–490 cm−1 and 560–660 cm−1) are the opposite. All of these results show that more rutile phase and less anatase phase are included in the sintered region than the unsintered one, which consistently demonstrates the laser sintering induced phase transition from anatase to rutile.

Note that the TiO2 film in (b) is without compression. 
Such a phase transition is known to occur only at temperatures higher than 550 °C by conventional furnace sintering for several hours. However, it was realized within seconds by the near-IR laser sintering. Indeed, the laser scanning mode at the current state is “point to line”, it is not appropriate to treat a very large film. However, it is feasible to improve the scanning mode to “line to plane” as schematically shown in Fig. S4† by replacing the point laser source to be a line laser,34 the selective laser sintering will be scalable and of great possibility to be integrated into non-stop roll-to-roll production lines. Besides, such a fast phase transition did not accompany crystal size growth, which was generally involved in conventional furnace sintering.35 Therefore, the high dye loading content of the P25 film could be maintained before and after laser sintering, which was tested to be 1.33 × 10−7 and 1.25 × 10−7 mol cm−2 respectively. High speed and no evident change in film morphology are outstanding advantages for the selective laser sintering technique proposed in this work.
Furthermore, from the above Raman analysis, the as-demonstrated phase transition may explain the inherent cause of the optical difference between the laser sintered regions and the base film (Fig. 2a). As we known, rutile TiO2 in comparison to anatase has higher refractive index,36 meaning higher light scattering ability, which generally makes it look whiter and it has been applied as a scattering layer in DSCs extensively.37,38 Since higher content of rutile phase is contained in the laser sintered regions, it is understandable that such regions look more opaque in Fig. 2a. Indeed, the stronger light scattering of the laser sintered film than the unsintered one has also been confirmed by their diffuse reflectance spectra (Fig. S5†).

Fig. 4a shows the current density–voltage characteristic curves of flexible DSCs made of TiO2 nanoparticle films with and without laser sintering. The performance parameters are summarized in Table 1. It could be clearly found that the short-circuit current density (Jsc) is evidently increased from 9.2 to 10.4 mA cm−2 associated with laser sintering. The fill factor is also increased dramatically from 0.71 to 0.77. These two improvements lead to the overall efficiency increasing dramatically by 23.9%, from 4.6% to 5.7% under 1 sun illumination. For flexible DSCs based on Degussa P25 TiO2 nanoparticles, the efficiency of 5.7% in this work is comparable to the top-level records reported previously,22,39–42 given that the light scattering layer, dense underlayer, etc. have been ignored. This highlights the positive effect of the selective laser sintering. Fig. 4b presents the IPCE spectra of the two compared solar cells. By integration of the IPCE curves the different Jsc values of the two samples could be explained.

In order to clarify the inherent causes of the laser sintering induced performance enhancement, we performed EIS measurements in the dark on the two compared solar cells. The important elements, including interfacial recombination resistance (Rct), electron transport resistance (Rt), and electron diffusion length (L), were extracted from fitting the impedance data to the transmission line model.43Fig. 5a shows the dependence of Rct on the dark current and Fig. 5b shows the dependence of Rt on the energy difference between the quasi-Fermi level of TiO2 and the redox potential of the electrolyte (“EFn − Eredox”). As presented in Fig. 5a and b, associated with laser sintering, the recombination resistance becomes larger, which means the back electron transfer through the TiO2–electrolyte interface is largely reduced; while the electron transfer resistance becomes smaller. Correspondingly, the effective electron diffusion length, defined as L = d × (Rct/Rt)1/2,44 is increased for the sample with laser sintering (Fig. 5c). Besides, it is known that Rt will contribute to the total series resistance of DSC and Rct will contribute to the shunt resistance. According to the one-diode model for solar cells, the decrease of series resistance and the increase of shunt resistance will both be beneficial for the rectifying effect, leading to the increase of fill factor of solar cells.45 Therefore, it is understandable that the laser sintered sample achieved a notably higher fill factor than the unsintered one (Table 1).
 Fig. 5  (a) The interfacial recombination resistance Rct, (b) the electron transport resistance Rt, and (c) the ratio between electron diffusion length (L) and actual film thickness (d) obtained from impedance measurements in darkness (corrected for the iR drop due to series resistance). 

Fig. 6 shows the results obtained from transient photovoltage/photocurrent decay measurements. As shown in Fig. 6a, the electron diffusion coefficient (De) is enhanced after laser sintering, which is consistent with the decreased electron transfer resistance in Fig. 5b.46 The apparent electron lifetime (τn) as a function of irradiating light intensity is plotted in Fig. 6b. Obviously, the lifetime between the electrons in the TiO2 conduction band and oxidized state component of the electrolyte is longer after laser sintering. This result is in agreement with the increased recombination resistance in Fig. 5a. Thus, the enhanced charge collection efficiency (ηcc, Fig. 6c) is found for the sample with laser sintering, which is consistent with the increased electron diffusion length in Fig. 5c. The improvement in ηcc could be mostly responsible for the IPCE improvement in Fig. 4b. The relative increase in ηcc is about only 2–4% on average, which cannot explain the total increase of IPCE (by 5–8%) especially in the 600–700 nm wavelength range. Such a mismatch might be compensated by the light scattering enhancement in the laser sintered film with higher rutile phase content.

Finally, a key question raised is: why could laser sintering result in such changes of the electrochemical elements, kinetic parameters of the solar cell devices, as described in Fig. 5 and 6? From the viewpoint of materials science, it might be answered as follows. First, the laser sintering may simultaneously induce inter-nanoparticle neck formation during the quick phase transition from anatase to rutile, which will result in more fluent electron transfer paths and decreased electron transfer resistance.47–50 Second, the temperature rise effect of the laser sintering might result in cleaner surfaces of TiO2 nanoparticles due to removal of some unwanted adsorbents or dangling bonds, and therefore may largely retard the interfacial recombination kinetics of the solar cell device.51–54
Conclusion
In summary, we have first demonstrated the validity of a facile selective laser sintering technique on the fabrication of TiO2 nanoparticle film on conductive plastic substrates for highly efficient flexible DSC applications. The laser sintering effects are reflected in the following aspects: (1) the sintering induced a partial crystal phase transition from anatase to rutile while keeping the film morphology nearly unchanged; (2) the optical property change: light scattering of the laser sintered TiO2 film is enhanced; (3) no damage to the plastic conductive substrate. The EIS and photovoltage/photocurrent decay characterization have consistently demonstrated the positive effect of laser sintering on charge collection of the solar cell, by both reducing the electron transport resistance and increasing the interfacial recombination resistance. IPCE and Jsc are accordingly increased. Another associated benefit is a greatly increased fill factor. Taken together, a flexible DSC after laser sintering has achieved an improved efficiency of 5.7%, which is 23.9% higher than the unsintered sample. Note that the laser treatment is a fast process: the effective sintering time is dramatically decreased from hours in a conventional furnace to seconds. It is of great potential for this technique to be integrated into scalable roll-to-roll manufacturing of highly efficient flexible DSCs in the future.

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  Schematic of (a) the computer controlled automatic laser sintering system; (b) the irradiation of the laser beam on the TiO2 film: the focus was set 14 mm above the film, with the circular spot diameter of 368 μm reaching the film surface; and (c) the scanning trace of the laser beam on the TiO2 film.	 

 	Fig. 2  (a) Optical image of the cold isostatic pressed TiO2 film on ITO/PEN substrate including three laser sintered patterns, square, circle and triangle, which are labeled by red arrows; SPM images of different regions of the TiO2 film: (b) before and (c) after laser sintering.	 

 	Fig. 3  (a) Raman spectra of the laser sintered and unsintered TiO2 (P25) films; (b) optical micrographs showing the detected area of Raman mapping on the TiO2 film (highlighted by the red square), including the interface of the laser sintered (on the left) and unsintered (on the right) regions; (c1–c4) Raman maps of the region in (b), describing the contrasts of the integrated intensities of Raman signals in the ranges of 100–180 cm−1 (c1), 490–565 cm−1 (c2), mainly attributed to the anatase phase, and 420–490 cm−1 (c3), 560–660 cm−1 (c4), mainly attributed to the rutile phase. Note that the TiO2 film in (b) is without compression.	 

 	Fig. 4  (a) Current density–voltage characteristic curves and (b) IPCE spectra of the two compared flexible solar cells based on the laser sintered and unsintered TiO2 films.	 

Unsintered	720	9.2	0.71	4.6%
Laser sintered	716	10.4	0.77	5.7%

 	Fig. 5  (a) The interfacial recombination resistance Rct, (b) the electron transport resistance Rt, and (c) the ratio between electron diffusion length (L) and actual film thickness (d) obtained from impedance measurements in darkness (corrected for the iR drop due to series resistance).	 

 	Fig. 6  The results obtained from photovoltage/photocurrent decay measurements: (a) the electron diffusion coefficient (De) as a function of open-circuit potential, (b) apparent recombination lifetime (τn), and (c) charge collection efficiency (ηcc) as functions of light intensity.
