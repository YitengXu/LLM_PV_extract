1 Introduction
With the development of society and science technology, humans have entered the era of intelligent automation. Energy, especially electrical energy has become an indispensable part of our lives. At the same time, due to the depletion of fossil fuel reserves and global warming, the demand for energy technology has also undergone tremendous changes and research in the field of energy applications has been rapidly emerging. Various energy application technologies are striving to achieve intelligent and efficient generation, storage, conversion and saving of energy. Energy storage technology plays a vital role in responding to increasing energy demand and overcoming the depletion of fossil fuels.1 Although lithium batteries based on electrochemical energy storage (EES) technology are the most important devices that are used in energy storage technology, due to the high cost, low abundance and slow charging rate of lithium, people have invested a lot of vigor in non-lithium energy storage technology.2,3,119 In non-lithium technology, electrochemical supercapacitors with complementary characteristics of traditional lithium battery charge storage are the current mainstream devices. In contrast, the charging rate of supercapacitors (a few seconds) is much faster than that of traditional lithium batteries (a few hours). However, the energy stored by capacitive materials (∼5 W h kg−1) is less than the energy stored by battery materials (∼200 W h kg−1).4,5,120–123 Therefore, based on the existing mature energy storage technology theory, optimizing or proposing a new energy storage concept is very valuable to promote the development of energy storage technology toward intelligence and efficiency. The energy storage technology based on electrochromic is a promising energy storage technology that has excellent capacity, efficiency, color indication and other characteristics (Fig. 1).

Electrochromic refers to charge injection/extraction caused by the applied potential difference or current or under the action of chemical reduction/oxidation that produces reversible changes in color and transparency. Normally, an electrochromic device's classical structure consists of the electrochromic layer, ion conductor layer, ion storage layer, and a multilayer structure with a transparent conductor layer and support or substrate on both sides (Fig. 2). Moreover, the electrochromic technology application is very extensive, in that, it has appeared in many promising future smart devices, such as building energy-saving smart windows, biological camouflage, electrochromic electronic skin, information displays, electrochromic energy storage devices (ECESDs) and so on.6 Due to the unique properties of ECESDs, for instance, excellent storage energy density, efficient charge and discharge efficiency, novel features and multi-functional characteristics in smart and interactive modes, and electrochromic could be integrated with photovoltaic materials, capacitive materials, battery materials, etc., which has been widely considered and has a high potential value and competitiveness in the field of energy storage.

Therefore, conducting a detailed review of the electrochromic energy storage device is important. In this review, the focus is on the following issues: the basic principles of electrochromic. The latest research examples, including all-inorganic, all-organic, organic–inorganic ECESDs that have a traditional structure, and including the photovoltaic ECESD, metal counter electrode ECESD, mechanical deformation ECESD that have special structure (Fig. 3). The performances of these examples are summarized in detail and compared with the current mainstream energy storage devices of lithium batteries and supercapacitors, this review also discusses the main challenges of ECESDs. Finally, in order to promote further research and development, some important development directions and trends in the field of electrochromic energy storage in the future are discussed.

2 Electrochromic basic principles
Electrochromic is the phenomenon of changes in the optical absorption or reflection caused by materials under the effect of electric potential difference or electric current. It appears as a reversible change in material color or transmittance in appearance, which means that the material could reversibly change from the faded state (or transparent state) to the colored state. An excellent electrochromic material requires good ionic and electron conductivity, high color contrast before and after the color change, short cycle time, and fast color fading efficiency and so on. According to the chemical structure, common electrochromic materials are mainly divided into two categories: organic and inorganic electrochromic materials.
Organic electrochromic materials are mainly concentrated on the conjugated polymers (CPs) and small molecule materials. The basic principle is the optical absorption or reflection of the material changes due to the oxidation of electrons in the material, which causes the color change. For example, the electrochromic principle based on CPs cathode material is that the CPs transfer charges through conjugated double bonds on the chemical backbone and have a broad π conjugation extension, and they are usually colored in a neutral state. When a voltage or current is applied, the carrier transport and polarity of the conjugated polymer will change, and the optical absorption will be red-shifted leading to bleaching. Through electrochemical reduction, the colored neutral state can be regenerated, which could be described by chemical formula (1).7,8 Similarly, there are anode CPs electrochromic materials, which can be described by chemical formula (2).7,9 (1) (2)
Inorganic electrochromic materials are mainly concentrated on transition metal oxides and their derivatives. Regarding its basic principles, people have proposed many models to explain, such as the color center model (Deb model), double injection model (Faughnan model), polarization model (Schirmer model), and free carrier model. At present, its discoloration mechanism in kinetics and chemicals is explained as the result of the injection/extraction of electrons and electrolyte cations, which is widely accepted. Taking a typical transition metal oxide tungsten oxide as an example, the electrochromic phenomenon can be described by chemical formula (3).6,11 Due to the application of an electric field, electrolyte cations (M+) are injected from the electrolyte into the tungsten oxide film, and electrons (e−) are injected from the cathode to the same tungsten oxide layer. They occupy the defect positions between atomic lattices to form a metastable tungsten bronze. The injected electrons are localized near WVI, forming WV, which is a transition absorption of electrons between the two different positions of WVI and WV, thus showing a color change. When a reverse voltage is applied, the electrolyte cations (M+) and electrons (e−) in the tungsten oxide film are extracted, as a result, the color disappears and the film becomes transparent again,6,11 as shown in Fig. 4. (3)
 Fig. 4  Electrochromic basic principle of tungsten oxide material. 
Currently, the charge storage mechanisms of ECES based on different materials are mainly divided into three types: (i) the first one is the battery materials. Battery materials store charge through the diffusion-limited Faraday reaction. The reaction involves almost the entire material so that it has the highest energy density in these three types. However, because the diffusion-limited Faraday reaction is generally slow, the charging time is normally very long. (ii) The second type is capacitive materials. Capacitive materials do not involve Faraday charge storage mechanism, and only realize charge storage through surface-controlled ion adsorption (Fig. 5A and B), so that they have a higher charging rate. (iii) The last type is pseudo-capacitance materials. The charge storage mechanism of pseudo-capacitance materials mainly includes controlled Faraday reaction on the surface of the material (Fig. 5C) or intercalation ions diffusion (Fig. 5D). These two mechanisms may exist in the same pseudo-capacitive material, thus not only the charging rate can be equivalent to that of the capacitive material, but also the energy density can reach the battery level.12–14,120,124

According to the basic principles of electrochromic, the electrochromic process involves the injection/extraction of electrolyte ions that are accompanied by the transfer of Faraday charges. This characteristic is very similar to the charge storage mechanisms of the pseudo-capacitance materials. Some previous studies have shown that many electrochromic materials are pseudo-capacitive materials, such as MnO2 and Nb2O5.13,16–18 Besides that, a typical electrochromic devices is composed of a transparent conductor layer, an electrochromic layer, an ion conductor layer, and an ion storage layer, which has many common features with energy storage devices such as batteries and supercapacitors.15,16 This provides the basis for the combination of electrochromism and energy storage. Moreover, many related studies have been reported.
3 The latest research progress of electrochromic energy storage devices
The ECESDs have the characteristics of intelligent interaction, which not only can monitor their energy levels through simple visual inspections, but also be used to adjust the sunlight and solar heat of the building windows and design new smart applications. In this section, the latest research on energy storage devices based on electrochromic technology will be introduced in detail. According to the difference on structure and electrode material, it can be divided into traditional structure ECESDs and special structure ECESDs, as shown in Fig. 6.
 Fig. 6  Classification and characteristics of ECESDs. 
3.1 Traditional electrochromic energy storage devices
The traditional ECESD generally has the same structure as the typical electrochromic devices or is optimized from the typical electrochromic device structure, which usually includes an electrochromic layer, ion conductive layer, ion storage layer, and transparent conductive layer. According to the different materials of the electrochromic layer and the ion storage layer, it can be divided into all-inorganic ECESD, all-organic ECESD, and organic–inorganic (inorganic–organic) ECESD.

3.1.1 All inorganic electrochromic energy storage devices. 
ECESD-based on inorganic materials or their derivatives have excellent chemical stability and efficient charge and discharge characteristics, which is one of the current research hotspots in electrochromic energy storage. The inorganic materials commonly used in ECESDs mainly include tungsten oxide (WO3), titanium oxide (TiO2), molybdenum oxide (MoO3), vanadium pentoxide (V2O5), and composite materials based on these materials for doping modification.
Tungsten oxide (WO3) has a wide range of applications in pseudo-capacitors and electrochromic fields due to its unique physical and chemical properties, such as low preparation cost, and various synthetic methods.6,19,20 Recently, the ECESDs based on tungsten oxide have attracted great attention. For example, Lei Liu et al. designed a smart portable power storage device based on tungsten oxide film electrodes, which can visualize the energy state. The device integrates energy storage and electrochromic behavior into a full structure by using tungsten oxide film deposited by magnetron sputtering as the electrode and nickel oxide film as the counter electrode.21 This device could provide a high energy density of 0.36 W h cm−3 and a high power density of 71.6 W cm−3, and it has a long-term service life of 5000 cycles and a capacity retention rate of about 96.4%. In addition, the energy state of the device can be estimated in real-time with the naked eye according to the obvious color change during the charging/discharging process (Fig. 7A). Xie et al. reported an energy storage smart window with electrochromic behavior from transparent to dark color and improved pseudo-capacitance performance. Mo doping in the device is achieved by a simple and economical electrodeposition method, which makes the WO3 film and the MnO2 nanoflake film as electrodes show excellent electrochromic and energy storage performance.22 The device can change color between transparent and dark, with more than 60% optical modulation in all visible light bands (420–800 nm), surface capacitance up to 19.1 mF cm−2, surface energy density and power density that are respectively 39.2 mJ cm−2 (0.11 W h m−2) and 1.12 W m−2, which can power LED bulbs for more than 90 s (Fig. 7B). Gayathri et al. designed a hydrated tungsten oxide nanosheet electrode for broadband electrochromic and energy storage and assembled it into electrochromic multifunctional smart glass (MSG), which can realize the combination of energy-saving functions and electrochemical energy storage.23 The author proved that the modulation bandwidth (full-range or NIR) can be preselected by controlling the pulse duration (−2.8 V) of the applied voltage. The device has excellent IR modulation efficiency (IRME, normalized) about 63%, solar modulation efficiency (SME, normalized) about 54%, and high coloring efficiency (97.8 cm2 C−1 at 600 nm). The electrode has an excellent volumetric capacitance of about 173 F cm−3, which is significantly increased to 28.7 F cm−3 in an all-solid prototype (operating voltage range ±2.5 V). When the constant current discharge current density is 0.1 mA cm−2, the highest volume energy density obtained is 85.7 mW h cm−3 and the power density is about 3.57 W cm−3, which is very suitable as an input power source. The device not only shows good stability (1000 continuous cycles) within one year but also has recoverable degradation characteristics (Fig. 7C).

Electrochromic material based on titanium oxide (TiO2) is another inorganic electrochromic material that is commonly used in electrochromic energy storage devices. This material represents a class of chemically inert, nontoxic, biocompatible and inexpensive high-bandgap semiconductors, with a wide range of interesting chemical and physical properties, including high refractive index, good electrical conductivity and excellent UV absorption, especially significant (photo) catalytic activity. It is a high-efficiency lithium-ion energy storage material, which has shown great potential in the field of energy storage.24–26 Recently, Cao et al. reported a visible light-near infrared dual-band smart window with internal energy storage. The device uses optimized Ta-doped nano-TiO2 nanocrystals as a multifunctional active material.27 The device can realize independent control and modulation of VIS (sunlight) and NIR (solar) transmittance, and it provides high charge storage capacity (466.5 mA h m−2 at a current density of 150 mA m−2). At the same time, it has high bistability and a long lifetime (Fig. 8A). Zhongqiu Tong et al. proposed a simple sacrificial template accelerated hydrolysis method to prepare a design lithium-ion insertion material layer on a TiO2 fluorine-doped tin oxide substrate. For example, mesoporous nanotube array (MNTA) film has a fast lithium-ion insertion kinetics and does not sacrifice window transparency. Assembled dual-function devices show excellent performance advantages.28 The dual-function smart window displays dark blue in the voltage range of −2.4 V to −4.0 V and at a current density of 0.25 A g−1, the assembled dual-function smart window can provide a discharge-specific capacity of 142 mA h g−1 in 2040 s (Fig. 8B). Suryakant Mishra et al. designed a heterostructure based on TiO2. The authors prepared TiO2 nanorods by a hydrothermal reaction and then grew the Co3O4 shell layer by electrodeposition, which could grow core–shell nanostructures on FTO-coated glass substrates.29 The structure exhibited high specific capacitance (342 F g−1) and surface capacitance (140 mF cm−2) at 100 mV s−1, and it could produce color changes between the transparent (sky blue) and opaque (dark brown) states, coloring efficiency was about 91 cm2 C−1. The porous form and strong surface adhesion of transparent conductive glass electrode had excellent cycle stability in both energy storage and electrochromic applications.

Electrochromic material based on molybdenum oxide (MoO3) also is an inorganic electrochromic material that is commonly used in ECESDs. By changing the oxygen deficiency or molybdenum–oxygen ratio in molybdenum oxides, their valence can be effectively changed so that they can obtain better electrochromic and energy storage characteristics, showing great potential in low-cost and environmentally friendly energy storage technology.30–34 Recently, Li et al. reported an electrochromic energy storage hybrid material based on molybdenum oxide, which uses a simple top-down synthesis method to synthesize colloidal MoO3 embed in the nanopores of W0.71Mo0.29O3 nanowires, which was formed as a solution-processable colloid. The optimized MoO3-based material designed by the authors had better lithium-ion diffusion kinetics, so, using this material as the electrode and NiO as the counter electrode to assemble the 8 × 8 cm2 complementary intelligent energy storage (ESS) window showed excellent performance.35 This smart window had a specific capacity of 2.33 mA h m−2, when the current density was 0.05 mA cm−1, and it could light up the LED for 10 minutes after charging only for 1 minute (Fig. 9).

Vanadium pentoxide (V2O5) is also a common material that has a rich color system in electrochromic technology. It is attractive for various photonic applications because multiple oxidation states can be identified through different colors. Due to its special spatial structure and high theoretical capacitance, the material also shows a huge potential for electrochemical energy storage. However, research on ECESDs based on V2O5 is still in the preliminary stage, and only a few reports exist in the literature. To develop and promote V2O5-based ECESDs, more attempts are needed to be applied to smart electronic devices in the future.36,37,116 Recently, Sajitha et al. reported ultra-thin nanowire mats based on vanadium pentoxide for electrochromic energy storage applications.37 The nanowire mats are composed of V2O5 coated with MnO2, which have multi-functional characteristics. The assembled electrochromic devices could display three different colors including orange (+3.0 V), green (−2.5 V) and blue (−3.0 V) and the surface capacitance could reach 13.7 mF cm−2. It has also enhanced electrochemical stability (1000 cycles) and the capacitance retention rate of bare nw-V2O5 is only 71%, while the capacitance retention rate increases to 93.6% after MnO2 coating (Fig. 10).

In addition, with the exploration of novel material and synthesis methods, researchers have designed and synthesized new materials for electrochromic energy storage based on the electrochromic mechanism and material structure. These new materials are slightly different from traditional electrochromic material modification methods. Most of those are composite materials with nanostructures, which show high development potential in the field of electrochromic energy storage. Recently, Yin et al. reported a novel nanostructured nickel carbonate-nickel hydroxide (NCH) film for large-scale color-changing thin-film energy storage devices, which has high optical contrast and energy storage capacity.38 The film designed by the author contains a dense seed layer under the porous nanowire layer, which provided an excellent capacitance of more than 170 mF cm−2 and could obtain a high optical contrast of about 85% (at 500 nm). The 13 cm × 13 cm multifunctional device constructed on a glass substrate has a surface energy density of 4.4 μW h cm−2 at the power density of 17.5 μW cm−2 and has good electrochromic performance (Fig. 11).

3.1.2 All organic electrochromic energy storage devices. 
Common organic electrochromic materials include conductive polymers such as polyaniline (PAN), polypyrrole (PPy), polythiophene (PT) and their derivatives; organic small molecules such as viologen and their derivatives. ECESDs based on all-organic materials and their derivatives are characterized by diverse designs, simple synthesis, cost-effective, rich colors, good structural modification and large-scale preparation. However, because of the weaker chemical stability of organic materials than that of inorganic materials, their stability and durability are less than optimal.39–41 Recently, Kim et al. reported a bifunctional electrochromic capacitive smart window based on CPs, which has excellent performance advantages.42 The authors fabricated a highly transparent electrochromic capacitor (ECC) window by combining high-contrast electrochromic polymer (ECP) and transparent capacitive polymer, which used blue ECP of poly(3,3-bis(bromomethyl)-3,4-dihydro-2H-thieno[3,4-b][1,4]dioxepine) (PR-Br) and red ECP of poly(3,4-di(2-ethylhexyloxy)thiophene-co-3,4-di(methoxy)thiophene) (Th-OR) to be the electrodes of two ECC windows, respectively, with the thin polyaniline (PANI) film as the counter electrode. The assembled ECC window has higher color contrast and capacitance stability, and it shows bistable characteristics when the dielectric poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) layer was introduced. It has high energy densities of 9.7 and 13.5 W h kg−1 and power densities of 75.3 and 58.8 kW kg−1, while the assembled red ECC window (Th-OR//PANI) also showed a higher energy density of 10.5 W h kg−1. The charge–discharge cycle of the device was greater than 120 cycles and it had excellent energy transfer stability exhibiting energy stored in the device, which could be transferred to others. For example, the blue ECC window can charge the red ECC window or the LED can be turned on that indicated the remaining energy judging by the color, see in Fig. 12.

3.1.3 Organic–inorganic combined electrochromic energy storage devices. 
Utilizing organic and inorganic materials could provide complementary advantages and greatly improve the performance of ECESDs.43–47 It is also one of the current research hotspots in the development of high-performance materials. In general, organic–inorganic or inorganic–organic materials utilized in the electrochromic layer and the ion storage layer could complement each other to enrich the color system and energy storage capacity, as well as the electrochromic layer which forms a special material structure. Koo et al. designed chitosan with WO3·H2O nanoparticles (WHNP) embedded in an amorphous WO3 (a-WO3) film. The hybrid membrane was composed of thin films and assembled with multifunctional ECESDs.48 The authors used the hybridization of chitosan and WHNP to produce unique chemical cross-linking so that the designed membrane exhibited excellent electrochromic energy storage characteristics, which not only improved conductivity and lithium-ion diffusivity but also enhanced electrochemical activity and stability, which can realize fast switching time (coloring of 4.0 s, bleaching of 0.8 s), high coloring efficiency (62.4 cm2 C−1), excellent long-cycle performance, retention rate (91.5%) after 1000 cycles. Subsequently, due to the enhancement of electrochemical activity and conductivity, the hybrid film exhibited significant energy storage performance with a higher specific capacitance (154.0 F g−1 at a current density of 2 A g−1). Compared with bare a-WO3, this hybrid film makes the 1.5 V white light-emitting diode lighter. Qingfu Guo et al. reported a high-performance asymmetric electrochromic supercapacitor based on poly(indole-6-carboxylicacid)/TiO2 nanocomposite, which used TiO2 nanorod arrays as the scaffold for the preparation of the difunctional porous network of poly(indole-6-carboxylicacid) (PICA)/TiO2 nanocomposites.49 Due to the synergistic effect of PICA and TiO2, the designed nanocomposite material had good electrochemical performance, excellent specific capacitance (23.34 mF cm−2) and charge and discharge stability. Notably, the nanocomposite material could be converted to each other under three color systems of yellow, green and brown, and used PICA/TiO2 as the anode material and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) as the cathode material to construct an asymmetric electrochromic supercapacitor device (ESD), which had high cycle stability and specific capacitance (9.65 mF cm−2) and could be switched from light green to dark blue. After charging, the device could light up a single LED for 108 seconds and evaluate the energy storage level by color changes (Fig. 13A). Recently, Yun et al. proposed a dual-function electrochromic supercapacitor that can display color real-time capacity, which was manufactured using tungsten trioxide (WO3) and a lithium ion-doped gel containing hydroquinone (HQ).50 The assembled device could display color real-time charge capacity and had high transmittance contrast (∼91%), high coloring efficiency (∼61.9 cm2 C−1) and high surface capacitance (∼13.6 mF cm−2), when the concentration was optimal for HQ, it had good charge/discharge cycle stability and could light up white LEDs of four devices in series (Fig. 13B).

3.2 Special structure electrochromic energy storage devices
The special structure ECESDs have more research potential than traditional ECESDs for the future as they have unique functions, such as the combination of electrochromic materials and photovoltaic materials to constitute an ECESD based on photovoltaic and self-powered ECESD based on the metal counter electrode. These new designs not only make ECESDs more in line with the need of future smart devices but also obtain new functions and higher performance compared with traditional ECESDs.

3.2.1 Photovoltaic electrochromic energy storage devices. 
In traditional ECESDs, the energy storage source comes from electrochemical potential energy, which is closely related to the electrical energy in human life. In the process of conversion and release, the waste of electrochemical energy is inevitable, and light energy, such as solar energy that is one of the excellent sustainable energy sources. Therefore, researchers have developed new types of smart devices, which are based on photovoltaic materials and electrochromic materials of special structure photovoltaic ECESDs. Such devices can collect solar energy converted by photovoltaic materials and detect the energy of the device through color changes.51,52,125–127 Devices with this special structure usually have two integration methods. One is to directly connect the electrochromic energy storage device to the photovoltaic cell. This method has low integration and simple assembly. It usually has a vertical stack configuration and a horizontal configuration. However, this integration method may cause the loss of transmittance modulation or require additional device surface area. The second is to integrate photovoltaic materials and electrochromic materials into one device. This method has a high degree of integration and a simpler device structure. In this integration method, the photovoltaic materials are usually dye-sensitized transparent materials. However, this integrated device will affect the usage time of the device due to unstable photovoltaic materials.117,118 This new design makes it more suitable for interaction with smart devices and sustainable development, which has broad research prospects in the future. For example, recently, Junhee Cho et al. reported a semi-transparent energy storage function photovoltaic integrated with electrochromic supercapacitors.53 In their work, the authors proposed a new type of translucent energy storage photovoltaic cell that could work all day, integrating high-efficiency translucent organic photovoltaics with low-power, gel-based electrochromic supercapacitors, and share one electrode. The new device designed by the authors had excellent energy conversion and storage efficiency (1.36%). Energy storage functional photovoltaic cells were optimized for design to generate photocurrent under sunlight and artificial indoor light so that it could operate around the clock. The electrochromic unit contained in the energy storage function photovoltaic could be automatically charged by the photocurrent generated by the photovoltaic cell. At the same time, it could monitor the stored energy or convey information according to the color change and can be used as a power source to extract the stored energy to light up the light-emitting diode (Fig. 14A). Zijie Xu et al. reported a flexible, controllable and angle-independent photochromic display.54 In their work, the authors proposed a novel structure of photochromic smart window (PECSW), which consisted of an electrochromic device (ECD) and multiple integrated fibrous dye-sensitized solar cells (FDSSC). To avoid blocking each other from the sun, the authors wrapped FDSSC around ECD and used it as a frame. When sunlight shines on the FDSSC, the solar cell can supply power to the smart window and adjust the transmittance according to light intensity. At the same time, PECSW can also effectively store energy and judge the stored energy level according to the color change (Fig. 14B). The device assembled by the author could be charged to 1.5 V in 57 s and discharged from 1.5 V to 0 V in 54 s and the energy density was 10.125 mW s cm−2 and the power density was 0.1875 mW cm−2, which was calculated by the authors.

3.2.2 Metal counter electrode electrochromic energy storage devices. 
A special structure type of electrochromic energy storage device based on metal counter electrodes has two characteristics: battery and electrochromic. For this type of devices, the counter electrode paired with the electrochromic electrode generally uses a more active metal with multivalent electrons (such as aluminum, zinc, and magnesium) and the electrolyte uses metal salt aqueous solution (generally corresponding to the metal used in the counter electrode) so that the half-reaction of the primary battery is involved in the energy exchange process, which can self-supply energy for the electrochromic process and has a good energy storage capacity. The mechanism can be simply described as, because, the counter electrode uses active metal, it is easy to release electrons to form corresponding ions, while the working electrode generally acts as an oxidant to obtain electrons and is accompanied by the insertion of electrolyte ions (Fig. 15A).128 Throughout the reversible process, it is environmentally friendly and requires no additional cost. At the same time, the energy level can be detected based on the color interaction of electrochromic. Therefore, this new type of electrochromic energy storage device has received extensive attention that is one of the current research hotspots.55–60 For example, recently, Yanling Zhai et al. have reported a self-rechargeable smart battery device with novel functions such as electrochromic, ROS biosensing and energy storage.61 The device designed by the authors uses Prussian blue (PB) as the electrode and magnesium metal as the counter electrode, which not only realizes fast self-charging and high power density output but also provides a continuous and stable power supply. Owing to the electrochromic properties of PB, the device can also be used as an electrochromic display, highly sensitive self-powered ROS sensing and visual analysis (Fig. 15B). The coloring state of the smart device designed by the authors was blue, when the PB electrode is connected to magnesium, it can be used as a power source, such as lighting up a red LED, and the electrochromic PB film will be bleached during the discharge process and become transparent Prussian white (PW). Relatively, when the PB electrode is disconnected from magnesium, the device will self-charge and the color will gradually return to blue. According to the author's report, the device has high power density and high sustainable stability, which can provide a power density of about 4 mW cm−2 during the first discharge, and the retention rate was about 90% after seven cycles. The optimized device can continuously light the LED for more than 2 hours. Haizeng Li et al. reported a rechargeable water-based electrochromic battery based on Ti-substituted tungsten molybdenum oxide and Zn2+ ion intercalation cathode.62 The battery uses Ti-substituted tungsten molybdenum oxide (Mo/Ti:WO3, MTWO) as the electrode and zinc as the counter electrode, which can be charged by an external voltage and be self-charged by spontaneously extracting Zn2+, this will enrich the application range of electrochromic energy storage devices. The device designed by the authors exhibited enhanced battery and electrochromic performance, which had an area capacity of 150 mA h m−2 and the open circuit potential (OCP) exceeded 1.2 V, and the optical contrast was as high as 62%. The high-performance rechargeable battery demonstrated by the author is transparent when the energy is saturated, and colored during discharging, which can power 0.5 V light-emitting diodes (LED) for more than 40 minutes and remain stable under continuous cycles. It is important that the device can self-charge (self-bleach) by spontaneously extracting Zn2+ ions from the metal, when the device energy is exhausted, which recovered within 24 hours and could light up the LED again for about 30 minutes (Fig. 15C). Wang et al. reported a flexible electrochromic rechargeable Zn//polypyrrole (Ppy) battery.63 The author used the electrochromic material polypyrrole (PPy) as the cathode and zinc (Zn) as the anode, thus realizing a flexible, electrochromic and rechargeable battery. Not only it could provide a high capacity of 123 mA h g−1 but also had flexibility in which the device color would change from black to yellow when the applied potential changed from 1.2 V to 0 V. Therefore, this unique short-circuit warning function could be used to detect circuits. In addition, in the electrochromic energy storage devices, the introduction of metal frames can also play a similar role. For example, Zhang et al. developed multi-color Zn-SVO electrochromic displays. The author embedded a zinc metal frame into the device structure, and both the working electrode and the counter electrode used stable vanadium oxide (SVO) nanorods as electrodes. The constructed electrochromic display showed switching between multiple colors (orange, amber, yellow, brown, light yellow and green), and had an open circuit potential of 1.56 V, which could realize self-coloring and energy recovery functions (Fig. 15D).129

3.2.3 Mechanical deformation electrochromic energy storage devices. 
Mechanical deformation is very common in daily lives. ECESDs based on flexibility and deformability are expected to overcome the limited application range of traditional ECESDs. It can be applied to wearable electronic devices in daily life, which have better biocompatibility characteristics. It is widely regarded as a promising multifunctional energy storage device. However, such ECESD with mechanical deformation characteristics has two challenges that must be considered: one is the device can still work normally under mechanical deformation (such as bending, wrapping), and the other one is that the electrode layer, electrolyte layer and the device frame or support can withstand repeated bending or even stretching so that the equipment can work normally.64–67 In addition, this type of device cannot eliminate the need for external power sources. Therefore, many researchers have put a lot of effort into designing and manufacturing wearable electrochromic energy storage devices that do not require an external power supply. A relatively novel concept is the integral integration of piezoelectric nanogenerators and electrochromic energy storage units, which can collect electrical energy converted from mechanical energy by piezoelectric nanogenerators and the energy level can be detected according to the color indication.68,69 For example, recently, Zhenzhu He et al. reported a piezoelectrically-driven self-powered electrochromic supercapacitor for human body motion energy harvesting, which has the advantages of flexibility and biocompatibility.70 The smart device designed by the author integrated with energy harvesting, conversion, storage and indication technology, which used polyaniline (PANI) as an electrode to be assembled into an electrochromic unit to store energy and indicate the energy level. The piezoelectric nanogenerators (PENGs) are constructed by polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) nanofibers, as an energy conversion device. This device can convert mechanical energy into electrical energy. The integrated wearable smart device can collect the human body's movement energy and other mechanical energy and then convert it into electrical energy and charge the device, and the energy state can be judged according to the color of PANI (Fig. 16).

Lithium batteries and supercapacitors are currently commonly used energy storage devices for mobile computers, mobile phones, backup power supplies, and electronic equipment, etc. According to the selected literature reports, the energy density–power density diagram is shown in Fig. 17A and the cycle-retention rate diagram is shown in Fig. 17B.21–23,27,28,38,42,48–50,54,60–63,69–110,114,115 According to Fig. 17A, the energy density of lithium batteries could reach about 40–1100 W h kg−1, supercapacitors could reach about 0.1–110 W h kg−1, and the ECESDs could reach about 10–40 W h kg−1. For power density, the lithium batteries can reach about 9–110 W kg−1, the supercapacitors can reach about 30–10000 W kg−1, the ECESDs can reach about 10–100 W kg−1. According to Fig. 17B, the cycle times of lithium batteries can reach about 10–1100 times, and the retention rate is relatively stable (above 70%). The cycles of supercapacitors can reach about 1000–10000 times and the retention rate is also relatively stable (above 75%). The cycles of ECESDs can reach about 20–10000 times, but the retention rate fluctuates greatly, which with the minimum being around 50% and the maximum being over 90%. Therefore, lithium batteries have an excellent energy density, and supercapacitors have excellent power density and cycle life and retention. However, for traditional lithium batteries, liquid electrolytes are usually used, which increases the leakage and flammability risks of the equipment, and it also limits the potential window to a certain extent. In addition, as the devices are recycled, lithium metal may change to form a moss-like or needle-like structure that can eventually damage the devices by a short circuit. Although all-solid-state lithium batteries, which are using solid electrolytes could better solve these problems as the solid electrolyte is not flammable and does not leak so that it effectively improve the safety of devices. Solid-state lithium batteries face the challenge of ion transmission at the interface of the solid electrolyte and the solid electrode, and high impedance may be generated in practical applications.111,112 The traditional supercapacitors usually have a larger volume to make up for the lack of their own capacity that is related to the charge storage characteristics of capacitive materials, which limit some applications of supercapacitors. In addition, most supercapacitors use acidic or alkaline aqueous electrolytes, organic electrolytes, etc. If used improperly, that will bring certain safety risks.5,113 Now more and more multifunctional electronic products require thinner, lighter, smarter, safer and even transparent energy storage devices to provide electrical energy. Based on these demand concepts, people have also developed self-charging supercapacitors, such as photovoltaic supercapacitors, supercapacitors with transparent structures and miniature supercapacitors, but the energy storage capacity is lower than that of lithium batteries and traditional supercapacitors. Therefore, people are seeking energy storage devices with more functions and novel functions to expand their applications. Energy storage devices based on electrochromic show great potential in future electronic applications.
In terms of energy storage performance, ECESDs has good energy density and power density, as shown in Fig. 17A, and has a capacity comparable to lithium batteries and supercapacitors, the conceptual diagram of the capacity depicted in Fig. 18.21–23,27,28,38,42,48–50,54,60–63,69–110,114,115 Using mA h g−1 as the unit to measure the capacity of lithium batteries and ECESDs that the capacity could be achieved by lithium batteries is about 120–1100 mA h g−1, the capacity could be achieved by ECESDs is about 120–400 mA h g−1. Using F g−1 as the unit to measure the capacity of supercapacitors and ECESDs that the capacity that can be achieved by supercapacitors is about 1–400 F g−1, the achievable capacity of ECESDs is about 100–400 F g−1. For lithium batteries, usually, the charge capacity is greater than the discharge capacity which causes part of the energy loss, but ECESDs could avoid that because the charge and discharge capacities are very close. The circulation and retention rate are also excellent, as shown in Fig. 17B. By analyzing Table 1, the cycle-retention rate of traditional inorganic ECESDs and organic–inorganic ECESDs is generally better than that of traditional all-organic ECESDs and ECESDs with special structures, which is the reason that may be causing instability of organic materials and the complex integrated system. In addition, the capacity and cycle stability of traditional electrochromic energy storage devices are generally higher than those metal counter electrode electrochromic energy storage devices, which may be caused by the asymmetric structure of the latter. In the electrochemical cycle, the metal electrode will have a certain impact on the device due to its higher activity. With the color indicator function, the charging status can be detected at any time and with a better intelligent interactive experience. At the same time, ECESDs with transparent characteristics can be better applied to daily lives. For example, smart windows could adjust the intensity of the indoor, increase comfort and reuse the stored energy, which is consistent with green sustainable development. In addition, lithium batteries and general supercapacitors cannot be charged without an external power supply, but ECESDs with the special structures break this bottleneck. This device can realize self-charging function through light, spontaneous ion extraction and mechanical deformation to achieve energy-saving and low-carbon life and extend the scope of application in the field activities and emergency power supplies. For material systems, ECESDs are more economical compared with lithium batteries and supercapacitors, because very little or no lithium element is required.
Through performance comparison between ECESDs and current mainstream energy storage devices of lithium batteries and supercapacitors, although ECESDs show great potential, they still face many challenges in future research, development and design. In the current research, for some purposes, such as powering electronic watches, and LEDs, electrochromic energy storage devices can already be used as independent devices such as lithium batteries and supercapacitors, but there is still a certain gap in the practical applications. Although the metal counter electrode ECESDs are simple in structure and rich in functions, the electrolyte solution is mostly a metal salt aqueous solution, which has a higher risk of leakage in practical applications. In addition, the low cycle stability is also one of the main challenges faced by organic ECESDs and photovoltaic ECESDs.
5 Conclusions and future perspectives
The electrochromic energy storage devices (ECESDs) have a unique color indication function which enriches the scope of application and has a better interactive experience. At the same time, ECESDs with a special structure break the bottleneck that requires an external power supply for charging, which is more in line with the concept of energy-saving and low-carbon life in the future. Therefore, electrochromic energy storage technology has great potential and room for expansion in future energy technology applications. At present, although many encouraging results have been achieved, ECESDs compared with the commercialized lithium batteries and supercapacitors, the performance of ECESDs is still far from the actual market standard, and the development of a new generation of ECESDs is still at an early stage. Before practical applications become possible, a lot of effort is still needed: (1) it is necessary to deeply understand the energy storage mechanism of ECESDs to control the interface reaction between the electrode and the electrolyte. Therefore, it is important to conduct principle research. In addition, the design of ECESDs based on other principles is also very important for the development of the field of electrochromic energy storage, such as electrochromic devices based on reversible metal electrodeposition. The principle of this device is to pass metal ions in the electrolyte, which is deposited on the working electrode to achieve coloring, dissolved metals to achieve bleaching. Moreover, this mechanism is expected to be combined with the metal counter electrode ECESDs.130,131 (2) Although the capacity and cycle retention rate are comparable to some reported lithium batteries and supercapacitors, there is still a big gap that compares with the current commercialized lithium batteries and capacitors. Therefore, it is beneficial to develop new electrode materials. As inorganic materials have better stability, low toxicity, and less volatile characteristics than organic materials, ECESDs based on inorganic materials will have very good competitiveness in future smart electronic products. Thus, the development of a new type of high-capacity and high-cycle retention rate inorganic electrochromic energy storage electrode material could well promote the development of electrochromic energy storage technology. (3) The self-charging function corresponds to a new type of electrochromic energy storage device, which has a wide range of space for future electronic applications. However, both photovoltaic ECESDs and mechanical deformation ECESDs have relatively complex integration. The metal counter electrode ECESDs has a simple structure, but most of the electrolytes are used in ionic aqueous solutions, which cause packaging difficulties and the aqueous solution will also affect the electrodes. Therefore, in order to play a better role in future smart or wearable devices, it is necessary to design and optimize the special type of ECESDs with self-charging functions, which have a simpler structure, a more stable cycle and retention rate, and a higher capacity. (4) Develop new electrolytes for electrochromic energy storage devices. Traditional ECESD electrolytes generally use lithium ions, hydrogen ions and sodium ions, because monovalent ions are easily incorporated into the crystal lattice of the electrochromic material. But there are also many problems, such as hydrogen ions are easily polarized during the cycle, forming hydrogen gas, sodium ion has a large radius, and the high cost of lithium ions. Other ions such as potassium ions have low desolventizing energy and can diffuse faster at the electrolyte–electrode interface. Moreover, Prussian blue analogs are the cathode materials of potassium ion batteries. Therefore, potassium ions are promising for more applications in ECESDs. Multivalent metal ions such as zinc ions and aluminum ions could provide multiple charges in the oxidation–reduction reaction, thereby enhancing the electrochromic response and energy storage capacity. Although it may be difficult to insert, it could be improved by designing electrochromic energy storage materials or the device structure, and the asymmetric ECESDs with the metal counter electrode structure and the current water-based zinc ion battery are expected to be combined with each other.132–135 (5) Develop a new structural skeleton. At present, most electrochromic energy storage structures are laminated structures, which make the interface between the layers prone to structural changes, thereby affecting performance. The design of new framework structures or conductive electrodes such as silver electrodes, carbon nano frameworks and zinc frameworks are expected to improve some of the performance of electrochromic energy storage devices.129,136
