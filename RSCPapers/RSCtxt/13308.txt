    , Accepted 21st April 2016First published on 25th April 2016AbstractAlthough Cu2S-containing chalcogenide solar cells are appealing and cost-effective for photovoltaics (PVs), these materials suffer from rapid performance degradation as a result of the diffusion of copper ions into the CdS layer. In order to prevent this degradation, we report, for the first time, the use of metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) as copper sources. MOFs are a unique class of materials for use in solar cells as they can be tailored to have high porosity in combination with a high density of Lewis basic sites incorporated within the framework backbone. These properties allow for post-metalation reactions to be carried out, which can be exploited for use as copper reservoirs. Experimental evidence shows that the Lewis-basic sites of bipyridine moieties can store copper(I) ions and these ions can be used to compensate for the diffused copper ions leading to an improvement in the stability of prepared Cu2−xS/CdS PV cells. This achievement can ultimately lead to the fabrication of low-cost, long-lived Cu-containing PV cells by using MOFs as supporting materials.
Introduction
With the global increase of environmental issues and demand for reliable energy as a result of an ever-increasing population, scientists and government agencies are highly motivated to discover and improve renewable energy technologies.1 Solar energy, with its abundant, clean, and inexhaustible nature, represents a viable renewable energy source to replace or severely diminish the use of energy derived from fossil fuel usage. One such technology, photovoltaics (PVs), is based on semiconductor materials that convert solar energy into electrical energy. Indeed, these materials comprise one of the fastest growing research fields and industries due to the demand for alternative energy sources. In order to meet the growth and demand rate, PVs require significant improvements as well as new production technologies.2,3 Cu2S-containing chalcogenide solar cells are promising, cost-effective PVs. This is primarily due to the abundance of Cu2S and its appealing indirect band gap (1.2 eV).4–6 In this regard, early work on thin-film chalcogenide solar cells (e.g. CuxS/CdS, CuxSe/CdSe, and CuxTe/CdTe) was carried out by employing simple fabrication technologies, including chemical vapor deposition and wet dipping.7 Reports have predicted a practical power conversion efficiency of 17.8% when using Cu2S-based solar cells, but an efficiency of 10% has only thus far been achieved.5,7 The likely reason for underperformance can be ascribed to copper being extremely mobile within the close-packed sulfur sublattice, in which facile diffusion across the p/n junction occurs, ultimately, causing rapid performance degradation.4,6,8 This problem has discouraged many researchers from carrying out further work on Cu2S as a photovoltaic material.7,9 It is noted that performance degradation, or long-term stability, is also a sizeable problem for third-generation PV devices, including dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) and perovskite solar cells (PSCs).10 However, renewed interest in Cu2S materials for solar energy conversion has recently been observed as a result of the preparation of various Cu2S nanowires and nanocrystals in order to investigate the advent of nanocrystal-based approaches.5,6
Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) represent a rapidly growing class of porous and crystalline materials. MOF structures consist of metal nodes that are stitched together by organic linkers, which allows for the properties of MOFs to be fine-tuned through the metal node and/or organic ligand.11,12 The synthesis, characterization, and applications of MOFs have been extensively reviewed13–19 and device fabrications based on these materials are currently under way.20 Although MOFs are well studied for gas storage and a range of other applications, their use in solar cells is relatively rare.21–28 In particular, only photocurrent measurements on MOF-based half cells22,29 as well as a fully devised Cu-MOF-based solar cell (with poor performance) have been demonstrated and reported.23 To the best of our knowledge, although MOFs have been used as stabilizers for DSSCs24–27 and, very recently, for PSCs,28 their application as support materials for stabilizing chalcogenide PVs is yet to be studied.
In order to develop MOFs as support materials, we chose zirconium-based MOFs (Zr-MOFs) as they are well known for their high thermal and chemical stabilities.30,31 In particular, UiO-type (UiO = University of Oslo) Zr-MOFs consisting of 12-connected Zr6-based metal nodes (Zr6O4(OH)4(COO)12) that result from ditopic linkers, such as terephthalic acid (UiO-66) or biphenyldicarboxylic acid (UiO-67), have been reported.30 The bipyridine (bipy) analogue of UiO-67 [UiO-67(bipy)], which has free Lewis basic sites to coordinate metal ions, has recently been reported32–37 for catalytic purposes such as oxidation,34 Suzuki–Miyaura cross-coupling reactions,35 arene C–H borylation,37 or H2S capture.36 With this structure in hand, our strategy is to incorporate copper ions into Zr-MOFs with the aim of compensating diffused copper ions from the Cu2−xS phase into the CdS layer of the Cu2−xS/CdS cell. Consequently, this will allow for the production of a cheap solar cell with a performance characterized by its longevity. Herein, we report the judicious selection of MOF materials that have inherent high porosity, chemical stability, and density of Lewis-basic sites from bipyridine moieties. These materials can effectively dock copper(I) ions for further storage use in order to compensate the diffused copper ions, thus improving the stability of the prepared Cu2−xS/CdS PV cells.
Experimental
UiO MOFs were prepared with minor modifications according to published procedures.30,32–35,37
Synthesis of UiO-67 (Zr-L1)
H2bph (biphenyl-4,4′-dicarboxylic acid) (155 mg, 0.641 mmol) was placed in a beaker with 25 mL N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and dispersed via sonication for 1 h. After the addition of a 5 mL DMF solution of ZrCl4 (150 mg, 0.641 mmol), the mother solution was stirred for 10 min and divided into two parts in 20 mL glass vials, and then incubated at 120 °C for 24 h.
Synthesis of UiO-67-bipy (Zr-L2)
H2bipy (2,2′-bipyridine-5,5′-dicarboxylic acid) (150 mg, 0.641 mmol) was placed in a beaker with 10 mL DMF and dispersed via sonication for 1 h. After the addition of a 5 mL DMF solution of ZrCl4 (150 mg, 0.641 mmol), the mother solution was stirred for 10 min and incubated at 120 °C for 24 h.
Synthesis of UiO-67-L10.5/L20.5
Mixed UiO-67-L10.5/L20.5 was synthesized with the same concentration (e.g. 0.641 mmol of ZrCl4 and 0.641 mmol of the total amount of organic ligands) and conditions as UiO-67-bph, using a reactant solution with a molar ratio of 0.5:(0.5):1 for H2bph/H2bipy/ZrCl4 in a glass vial with 10 mL DMF (Table S1†). The solids were dispersed via sonication for 1 h, followed by incubation at 120 °C for 24 h.
Drying and solvent exchange procedure
After cooling to room temperature, the corresponding materials were collected by vacuum filtration, washed with DMF (3 × 10 mL), followed by soaking in acetonitrile (MeCN) for 3 days, in which the solution was exchanged with fresh MeCN (10 mL) every 24 h. After 3 days of soaking, the solids were collected via vacuum filtration and dried under vacuum. The details are provided in the Experimental procedures.
Post-metalation
Copper iodide (95 mg, 0.5 mmol for UiO-67-bipy; 47.5 mg, 0.25 mmol for the other MOFs) was dissolved in MeCN (20 mL) and then the respective UiO-MOF (∼100 mg, 0.5 mmol) was added to the solution and incubated at 60 °C for 14 h. The excess copper iodide was removed by washing the MOF with MeCN at 60 °C. The solution was exchanged with fresh MeCN (10 mL) every 2 h until the supernatant became colorless, at which time the solvent was removed as explained in the Experimental procedures.
Experimental procedures
Starting materials and solvents were purchased and used without further purification from commercial suppliers (Sigma-Aldrich or Merck). All MOFs described were isolated and stored as dried solids. The elemental microanalyses (CHN contents) were carried out with a LECO TruSpec Micro CHNS analyzer. TG and DTA curves were obtained using a Seiko Exstar 6200 TG/DTA thermal analyzer under a dynamic air atmosphere. A sample size of 4–5 mg and a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 in the temperature range of 30–800 °C were used. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) data were collected on a Rigaku/SmartLab diffractometer operating at 3000 W power (40 kV, 30 mA) using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å) and a 2θ range of 3 to 50°. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) specific surface area and N2 adsorption isotherms were measured using a Quantachrome NOVA 4200e instrument at 77 K. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the samples were taken with a JEOL JSM-6610 (20 kV accelerating voltage under vacuum) and energy dispersed X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) analyses were performed with an Oxford Instruments Aztec Inca X-Act instrument. For this measurement, ∼1 mg of activated Zr-MOF material was transferred to conductive carbon tape on a sample holder disk and coated using a Quorum SC7620 Mini Sputter Coater with Au for 60 s. Images were collected with ∼20000× magnification.
BET surface area analysis
To determine the BET specific surface area, ∼100 mg of UiO-67 sample was evacuated on a Quantachrome FloVac degasser under vacuum overnight at 120 °C. The sample tube was re-weighed to obtain a consistent mass for the degassed exchanged MOF. BET surface area (m2 g−1) measurements were conducted at 77 K by N2 adsorption on a Quantachrome NOVA 4200e Adsorption Analyzer and the surface area of each material was calculated using the BET equation.
Preparation of solar cells
Layered Cu2S was prepared on CdS samples by an ion exchange method (wet dipping method).38 For this, a 50 mL saturated aqueous solution of CuCl (10 mg) was prepared by adding 1 mL HCl (33% v/v) in deionized water at boiling temperature. Thus, CdS single crystal samples were immersed into the saturated CuCl solution three times, kept for 3 s each time, washed with distilled water and then annealed at 180 °C in air for 8 min. MOF–methanol mixtures containing 5 mg MOF sample in 5 mL methanol were dropped on the masked surface of Cu2S and then annealed at 180 °C under atmospheric conditions. The current–voltage (J–V) characteristics of Cu2−xS/CdS solar cells were measured using a Keithley 2410 Source Meter under standard conditions (93 mW cm−2, AM1.5D) with a ScienceTech Inc. solar simulator.
Results and discussion
UiO-type Zr-MOFs were prepared via a reaction of ZrCl4 with biphenyl-4,4′-dicarboxylic acid (bph, L1) and 2,2′-bipyridine-5,5′-dicarboxylic acid (bipy, L2) at 120 °C in DMF for 24 h. The composition and the results of the surface area measurements are provided in Table S1.† The three-dimensional representation of the Cu(I)-functionalized MOF as well as the simulated and experimental powder XRD patterns of the Zr-MOFs are shown in Fig. 1a and b. In particular, Zr6O4(OH)4(COO)12 units contain tetrahedral and octahedral pores with diameters of 1.2 and 1.6 nm, respectively (Fig. 1a). The PXRD (Fig. 1b) and SEM analyses indicated that the prepared UiO-67 MOFs form phase-pure products with a homogeneous particle morphology having crystal sizes of ∼100 nm (Fig. 2a, S3, S6 and S9†). The N2 adsorption isotherms of UiO-67 MOFs measured at 77 K exhibited reversible and typical type-I isotherm characteristics for microporous materials. The corresponding Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface areas of UiO-67-L1L2 (containing 50% bipy, 1921 m2 g−1) and UiO-67-L2 (containing 100% bipy, 2360 m2 g−1) are comparable with the reported values (2385, 2646 and 2051 m2 g−1).32,33,35 The relatively low surface area of Zr-L1 (1465 m2 g−1) is attributed to the non-optimized synthetic conditions. This is expected because to control the crystal size and crystallinity, a modulator (formic acid, acetic acid or other monocarboxylic acids) is usually employed.31,39 However, we chose not to use modulators in our synthetic protocol in order to obtain small particle size materials.

The prepared UiO-67 MOFs were post-metalated with copper iodide via incubation in acetonitrile solution containing CuI at 60 °C resulting in Zr-L1:Cu, Zr-L2:Cu, and Zr-L1L2:Cu as materials with a copper reservoir. It is noted that quick color changes from white to pale green within minutes were observed for Zr-L2:Cu and Zr-L1L2:Cu, pointing to the likelihood that interactions occurred between the pyridine nitrogen atoms and copper ions. The coordination of copper (CuCl, CuCl2, CuBr, and Cu(NO3)2) via pyridine nitrogen for UiO-67-bipy MOFs has been previously proven by single crystal X-ray diffraction.36,37 Simultaneous (bpy)CuCl and (bpy)Cu(CuCl2) formation to some extent was reported after impregnation of CuCl and no solvent molecules around Cu were observed suggesting a three coordinated environment for copper(I) ions as in our case.37 In contrast, very slow color change and low copper loading capacity of the Zr-L1:Cu MOF after incubation were attributed to the reaction between the hydroxyl groups (μ3-OH) on the Zr6O4(OH)4 cluster core with copper ions. Indeed, it has recently been demonstrated that the hydroxyl groups on the Zr node of UiO-67 can react with and immobilize MgII, AuI, ZnII and AlIII species.40,41
BET analyses from the N2 adsorption isotherms after post-metalation indicate a decrease in the surface areas of Zr-L1:Cu, Zr-L2:Cu and Zr-L1L2:Cu to 1226, 1392 and 1235 m2 g−1, respectively, due to the incorporation of heavy Cu and I atoms. To confirm that the observed post-metalation is indeed homogenous, EDX elemental mapping was performed (Fig. 2b for the Zr-L1L2:Cu MOF), confirming the homogenous distribution of the copper ions (Fig. S3, S6 and S9†). Furthermore, the elemental composition supported the formulation of the materials as Zr6O4(OH)4(bph)6(CuI)0.5, Zr6O4(OH)4(bipy)6(CuI)6, and Zr6O4(OH)4(bph)3(bipy)3(CuI)3 for Zr-L1:Cu, Zr-L2:Cu, and Zr-L1L2:Cu, respectively (Table S1†).
Copper(I) containing MOFs were prepared as stripped films (∼50 nm thickness, see ESI†) on a Cu2S phase38 and MOF/Cu2−xS/CdS PV devices were prepared. The prepared devices were named as Zr-L1:Cu/Cu2−xS/CdS, Zr-L2:Cu/Cu2−xS/CdS, and Zr-L1L2:Cu/Cu2−xS/CdS and the effect of the MOF composite was subsequently screened for solar cell applications using contact models illustrated in Fig. 3a–c. A representative SEM image of the prepared MOF/Cu2−xS/CdS layer is provided in Fig. 4g (inset), in which it can be seen that the Cu2S layer is darker than the MOF + Cu2S layer.

As an illustrative example, the J–V graphs of the prepared solar cells obtained (Fig. 3, Model b) on the 22nd day under a solar simulator (93 mW cm−2, AM1.5D) are shown in Fig. 4, curves a–d. From the origin region, it is clearly evident that all devices function as a PV cell. However, the Zr-L1L2:Cu/Cu2−xS/CdS solar cell displays distinct J–V behavior after the origin, in which the J values of this cell sharply decrease after certain voltages (breakdown voltage) (Fig. 4d). This signifies an apparent decrease in the conductivity as a result of Cu–O or i-Cu2S (i = intrinsic) formation causing a nonconductive “off” state.9,42
The J–V curves of the Zr-L1L2:Cu/Cu2−xS/CdS solar cell measured on different days are provided in Fig. S10.† The breakdown voltage curves of this cell change each day, indicating that the working capability of the prepared cells is dependent on the presence of the MOF (Fig. 4e, S10†). The Zr-L1L2:Cu MOF contains 5.30% copper(I)iodide, which is less than that in Zr-L2:Cu (9.10%).
Pfisterer et al. vacuum deposited a copper layer onto the surface of the Cu2S/CdS cells and the cells were treated in air at 180 °C.9 However, this copper treatment strongly decreased the efficiency of the PVs due to the formation of i-Cu2S and Cu–Cu2S metal–semiconductor junctions.9 These findings can be correlated with our results of the Zr-L2:Cu/Cu2−xS/CdS device, in which the copper content is higher resulting in a decreased efficiency. In the present study, the optimum copper amount was found to be ∼5.0% for these systems.
The short-circuit current density values (the current through the solar cell when the voltage across the solar cell is zero; Jsc) of the prepared solar cells are shown in Fig. 5a–d.
 Fig. 5  Current density values (Jsc) of the prepared solar cells: (a) Pristine Cu2−xS/CdS; (b) Zr-L1:Cu/Cu2−xS/CdS; (c) Zr-L2:Cu/Cu2−xS/CdS; (d) Zr-L1L2:Cu/Cu2−xS/CdS devices measured on the MOFs. 

Fig. 5a shows the Jsc values of the pristine Cu2−xS/CdS solar cell (without MOF, Fig. 3, Model a). It is clear that the Jsc values of the pristine Cu2−xS/CdS solar cell steadily decrease as a result of the diffusion of copper ions into the CdS phase.6–8 This reduction reaches 26.6% after 40 days.
The Jsc values of the Zr-L1:Cu/Cu2−xS/CdS (Fig. 5b) and Zr-L2:Cu/Cu2−xS/CdS (Fig. 5c) devices, depending on time, exhibit a similar decreasing trend to those of the pristine Cu2−xS/CdS solar cell, specifically these are reduced to 29.7%. The variance of Jsc in Fig. 5a and c is attributed to the different hetero-gate formations caused by the random change of the x value of Cu of solar cells. Interestingly, the Jsc values of the Zr-L1L2:Cu/Cu2−xS/CdS device (Fig. 5d) measured on the top of the MOF strips (Fig. 3, Model b) show an increasing trend after the first 10 days, which is comparable with the values measured between the MOF strips (Fig. 3, Model c and S11†). The current density values of the Zr-L1L2:Cu/Cu2−xS/CdS cell increase from 0.26 mA cm−2 to 7.58 mA cm−2 suddenly after 10 days and remain mostly stable thereafter. The very low Jsc at the beginning of the experiment is assigned to incomplete interactions between the MOF and the heterojunction. The high diffusion constant of copper ions into the single crystal CdS phase at 300 K (D = 1.2 × 10−13 cm2 s−1) compensates these interactions very quickly. Furthermore, Fig. S11† shows that the Jsc values of the Zr-L1L2:Cu/Cu2−xS/CdS device measured between the MOFs are sinuous for the first 22 days and comparable with those of the pristine device; however these values start to increase steadily after 22 days. This improvement is most likely to have been caused by the diffusion of copper ions from the MOFs to the cell resulting in an increase in the Jsc value by 19.9%.
In order to gain a deeper understanding about the diffusion of the copper ions and to determine if the immobilized copper ions within the MOFs are mobile, we first attempted to analyse whether the Cu-loaded MOFs were sensitive to the outer effects. Thus, we prepared MOF layers on glass substrates and the prepared samples were irradiated for 40 minutes under the solar simulator at 93 mW cm−2. As shown in Fig. S12,† some aggregates were observed after irradiation and became increasingly more dominant upon higher copper content within the MOFs. There was no apparent aggregation detected for the pristine MOF. Secondly, Zr-L1L2:Cu MOF layers, with ∼100 nm thickness, on CdS single crystals were prepared. Initially, an ohmic behavior was observed from the I–V measurements (Fig. S13a†). This ohmic behavior started to change the rectifier behavior after 7 days (Fig. S13b†). To speed up the process, the prepared samples were annealed at 100 °C and 180 °C under atmospheric conditions for 40 min in an oven. With increasing temperatures, a rectifier diode behavior became dominant (Fig. S13c and d†). Therefore, it is concluded that this shift in the I–V graphs can be explained by the formation of Cu/CdS or Cu2S/CdS phases, which is a proof for the mobility of copper ions loaded in the prepared MOFs.
Conclusions
This work demonstrated that deficient Cu(I) ions diffused from Cu2−xS to the CdS phase can be supplemented to a Cu2−xS/CdS solar cell by using a suitable MOF. As a result of this discovery, MOFs can be used as support materials to positively impact the longevity of chalcogenide Cu2−xS/CdS solar cells. Additionally, we have demonstrated that MOFs are desirable host materials to store and release desired molecules or ions for designing purposes. Furthermore, structural changes remarkably switch the prepared device between a conductive “on” state and a nonconductive “off” state.

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  Molecular representations of the Zr-L1L2:Cu MOF. (a) Structure of the isolated bipy-CuI center inserted into the MOF structure and a three-dimensional representation of the Cu(I)-functionalized MOF. Color code: [Zr6O4(OH)4]12+ cluster (blue polyhedra); black, red, dark green, pink and green spheres represent carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, copper and iodide atoms, the pink and yellow balls represent the octahedral and tetrahedral cages of the MOF, respectively. (b) PXRD patterns of the Zr-MOFs: simulated UiO-67 (1), as-prepared Zr-L1L2 (2), activated Zr-L1L2 (3), and Zr-L1L2:Cu (4).	 

 	Fig. 2  (a) SEM image of the Zr-L1L2:Cu MOF; and (b) EDX maps of the Zr-L1L2:Cu MOF.	 

 	Fig. 3  Contact models used for the J–V measurements. (a) Pristine cell; (b) on the top of the MOF strips; and (c) between the MOF strips.	 

 	Fig. 4  
J–V graphs of the prepared solar cells. (a) Pristine Cu2−xS/CdS; (b) Zr-L1:Cu/Cu2−xS/CdS; (c) Zr-L2:Cu/Cu2−xS/CdS; (d) Zr-L1L2:Cu/Cu2−xS/CdS; (e) the breakdown voltage curves of the Zr-L1L2:Cu/Cu2−xS/CdS cell; (f) J–V curves of the Zr-L1L2:Cu/Cu2−xS/CdS cell for different days; (g, inset) a representative SEM image of the MOF/Cu2−xS/CdS layer.	 

 	Fig. 5  Current density values (Jsc) of the prepared solar cells: (a) Pristine Cu2−xS/CdS; (b) Zr-L1:Cu/Cu2−xS/CdS; (c) Zr-L2:Cu/Cu2−xS/CdS; (d) Zr-L1L2:Cu/Cu2−xS/CdS devices measured on the MOFs.
