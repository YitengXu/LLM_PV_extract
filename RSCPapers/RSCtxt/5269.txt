    , Accepted 21st September 2005First published on 13th October 2005AbstractIn this paper we report the synthesis of the antimony chalcogenides Sb2X3 (X = O, S, Se, Te) by a colloid route. Several materials with a regular nanomorphology exhibit a change in structure depending on the reaction conditions. A range of morphologies are found including rods, wires, tubes and wafers. This report is, to our knowledge, the first synthesis of nanodimensional Sb2Te3 by a colloidal route.
Introduction
There is a wealth of interest in the developing nanomaterials of many chalcogenide compounds.1 Study is driven by the size dependent nature of the semiconducting properties of these materials or the novel nanostuctures of the final products. There is a keen interest in producing a range of materials with a wide range of band gaps in order to prepare devices from solar cells, which require a relatively large band gap, to peltier devices, which require a small band gap. Furthermore, with a generally growing field of flexible semiconductor devices, there is a drive to produce materials which may be processed by more conventional solvent based techniques such as spin and dip coating.2 It is therefore of particular interest to develop a colloidal route to antimony chalcogenides which have band gaps ranging from 1.7 eV to 0.3 eV. Antimony chalcogenides may be readily prepared in bulk by simply heating the pure elements to 900 °C.3 There are several reports of thin films of such materials produced by chemical bath deposition,4 electro deposition5 and spray deposition.6 However, there are very few colloidal routes to these materials. Generally it is fairly easy to produce the sulfides by solvothermal,7 polyol,8 sonochemical9 and hydrothermal10 techniques which usually result in nanowires of Sb2S3 in the orthorhombic phase. The complexity of adding a suitable selenium or tellurium source complicates the preparation of the lower chalcogenides. Techniques such as solvothermal,11 templating,12 and hydrothermal synthesis13 have been reported for the synthesis of Sb2Se3 nanowires in the orthorhombic phase. However, to our knowledge, there have been no reports of nanoscale Sb2Te3via a colloid route. A general route to this series of materials will not only provide a method for their preparation but will also allow the chemistry of the synthesis to be investigated in greater depth. We have recently published a new route to bismuth chalcogenides14 which uses the elemental chalcogen in a reducing media to facilitate the formation of chalcogen reactive species and it seems that a similar method could be employed for the preparation of antimony chalcogenides.
Experimental
Sulfur (99.5%), selenium (99.5%), tellurium (99.8%), antimony acetate (99.99%), octylamine (99+%), dodecylamine (98%), methanol (99.9%) and toluene (99%) were purchased from Aldrich and used as received.
TEM samples were prepared by suspension in toluene followed by evaporation onto a carbon coated grid. Images were collected on a Philips CM200 using a 200 kV accelerating voltage. SEM samples were prepared by careful sprinkling of the sample onto an adhesive carbon tab mounted on an aluminium stub and coating with amorphous carbon by low pressure evaporation. Images were collected on a FEI FEG-SEM. Powder-XRD were collected using a Brucker D8 diffractometer equipped with a CuKα source.
Preparation of Sb2E3 (E = O, S, Se, Te)
Antimony acetate (500 mg) was dissolved in the amine (40 ml) and the mixture degassed for 1 hour, with heating (∼80 °C) in the case of dodecylamine. The chalcogenide was dissolved or suspended in the appropriate amine (10 ml). The degassed reaction solution was heated to reflux under nitrogen and the chalcogenide added. The reaction was then heated for 90 mins (up to 48 hr in the case of Te). After cooling, the product was isolated by precipitation with methanol and cleaned by washing with toluene and reprecipitation with methanol.†
Results
There appears to be a reaction between the antimony acetate and the octylamine. Isolation of the resulting white power and subsequent XRD analysis showed that the material was Sb2O3 (Fig. 1; JCPDS 43-1071). It is well known that antimony halides hydrolyse rapidly on contact with water to form the oxides. It is therefore suggested that the acetate reacts with the small amount of residual water in the amine, probably via a base catalysed reaction, to give Sb2O3 as the active antimony source in these experiments. The XRD pattern of the Sb2O3 powder showed broad peaks for the oxide indicating that the material may be an extremely fine powder. Analysis of the diffraction line at 27.6° using the Sherer equation suggests that the particles are approximately 20 nm in diameter. The TEM images (Fig. 2) show that the material consists of triangular wafers of Sb2O3.

Preparation of Sb2S3
Antimony sulfide was prepared in octylamine and dodecylamine under reflux. In each case it was isolated as a brown solid and found to be stibnite in the orthorhombic form by powder XRD (Fig. 3; JCPDS 42-1393). TEM images (Fig. 4) of the material showed that both samples contained anisotropic nanomaterials. The reaction in octylamine gave bundles of high aspect ratio fibres. These were found to have a diameter of 35 nm and a length of 4.4 μm, giving an average aspect ratio of 1 ∶ 135 (±55).‡ At higher temperatures, in dodecylamine, it was found that the product was also anisotropic but with a much reduced aspect ratio (1 ∶ 7 (±2)) but with only a small increase in width (86 nm; Fig. 5). HR-TEM (Fig. 6) shows that the wires grow preferentially along the c-axis.

Preparation of Sb2Se3
Selenium is only slightly soluble in hot amines but, at both temperatures, reaction with the antimony source proceeded readily resulting in the formation of Sb2Se3 in the orthorhombic phase as determined from the powder XRD pattern (Fig. 7; JCPDS 15-0861). TEM analysis of the products showed them to be markedly different. At low temperatures (Fig. 8) a mixture of tubes and wires are produced with aspect ratios of 1 ∶ 28 (±13) (diameter 155 nm) for the wires and 1 ∶ 10 (±1) for the tubes (diameter 860 nm), whereas at higher temperatures the product is comprised exclusively of rods (diameter 80 nm, aspect ratio 1 ∶ 14 (±7)). Both showed growth along the c-axis (Figs. 9 and 10). There have only been a few reports of antimony chalcogenides with the tube like structure observed here.15 In both cases the structures are larger than that observed here. The formation of a tube with a regular cubic cross section cannot be readily explained by crystal growth arguments. However, it is suggested that the tubes form as a result of a self assembly process of the nanowires. This is based on the fact that the lengths of both the tubes and the wires are similar and the widths of the tube walls are approximately the same as the diameters of the wires.

Preparation of Sb2Te3
Attempts to prepare antimony telluride in refluxing octylamine only resulted in the isolation of tellurium. However, a reaction in dodecylamine over 10 hours yielded Sb2Te3 but with significant elemental tellurium contamination. Increasing the reaction time to 48 hours resulted in the formation of pure Sb2Te3 in the rhombohedral phase (identified by powder XRD Fig. 13; JCPDS 15-0874). The nanomorphology of the material was found to be hexagonal wafers (Figs. 14 and 15) with a flat-to-flat distance of ∼150 nm. This morphology has been previously reported for bismuth selenide and telluride and it is interesting to note that in both the other cases the material also formed in the rhombohedral phase. This is, to our knowledge, the first reported synthesis of nanoscale antimony telluride by a colloidal technique.

Discussion
There was a small amount of elemental antimony present in the Sb2S3 reaction product formed in dodecylamine. The increased temperature from 180 °C, coupled with the mildly reducing amine reaction media may result in the reduction of some of the starting material or product to elemental antimony. Similar antimony contamination was found in the higher temperature preparation of Sb2Se3 but not for Sb2Te3. The formation of small amounts of antimony does suggest a second possible route to Sb2X3 nanomaterials. This would involve the initial reduction of the precursor to the elemental metal followed by its subsequent oxidation by the chalcogen. However, it seems strange that the weakest oxidant should result in no antimony contamination. Therefore we suggest that the formation of elemental antimony is a result of the reduction of the Sb2X3 material. The resulting products are likely to be XH2 species. It is well known that H2Te is much less stable that H2S and H2Se therefore it seems likely that on formation of H2Te it immediately decomposes back to Te which is then available for further reaction whereas the H2S and H2Se are lost from the reaction.
It is also interesting to note that the relationship between morphology and crystal phase of the antimony series seems to follow a similar pattern to that for the bismuth chalcogenides.15 The orthorhombic materials Bi2S3, Sb2S3 and Sb2Se3 all give rod or wire morphologies whereas the rhombohedral materials Bi2Se3, Bi2Te3 and Sb2Te3 all give hexagonal wafers.
The effect of temperature on morphology is apparent, both Sb2S3 and Sb2Se3 show a change in aspect ratio. Rationalising these changes, in aspect ratio and diameter, especially the reduction in aspect ratio from 1 ∶ 135 to 1 ∶ 7 for Sb2S3, is not obvious. At the higher temperatures a larger number of seed particles form resulting in an overall decrease in the size of the final product as is reflected in the aspect ratio. The increase in the width of the rods can be understood if the crystal form of the material is considered. In both cases the materials are of the orthorhombic phase and anisotropic growth along the c-axis dominates. However it would appear that growth perpendicular to the c-axis becomes more dominant at higher temperatures. This observation can be rationalized by considering mass transport in the system. At low temperatures the rate of growth along the c-axis is approximately 135 times that perpendicular to it, as estimated from the aspect ratio of the final material. At higher temperatures the reaction rate associated with the growth at both surfaces will increase but it will be more difficult to transport material to and from the surface. The diffusion limitation will be more pronounced for growth along the c-axis due to the faster rate and the comparatively smaller surface area. It is therefore suggested that the morphology of the final materials is a function of the reaction thermodynamics as well as the mass transport in the system.
Conclusions
We have reported the facile syntheses of nanodispersed antimony chalcogenides via a colloidal route. In general the reaction can be written as: 2Sb2+ + 3X + 6e-
					→ Sb2X3where X is the chalcogen and the electron is provided via oxidation of the amine. Furthermore we have shown that the materials have a range of morphologies and that chemistry of the system and the mass transfer kinetics have a marked effect on the morphology of the final material. In particular this method provides a much needed colloidal route to antimony telluride.
