    , Accepted 7th March 2023First published on 8th March 2023AbstractAll-inorganic quasi two-dimensional (quasi-2D) or two/three-dimensional (2D/3D) mixed perovskites are still in their infancy, even though they are expected to inherit the advantages of quasi-2D perovskites and all-inorganic perovskites employed in solar cells, light-emitting diodes, and detectors. Herein, we studied a series of all inorganic 2D/3D halide perovskite materials, Csx+2Pbx+1(SCN)2(I/Br)3x+2. Different from common organic–inorganic hybrid quasi-2D perovskites exhibiting phase mixtures of different inorganic sheets, the Csx+2Pbx+1(SCN)2(I/Br)3x+2 (x = 1, 2, 3) phases only consist of 2D Cs2Pb(SCN)2(I/Br)2 and 3D CsPb(I/Br)3 perovskite phases (here x defines the ratio of 3D CsPb(I/Br)3 and 2D Cs2Pb(SCN)2(I/Br)2 perovskite phases). Based on the optimized morphology from the Pb(Ac)2 additive and hexadecyltrimethylammonium iodide (CTAI) passivation, the devices based on Csx+2Pbx+1(SCN)2I3x+2 (x = 3) achieve a PCE of 8.1%.
Introduction
Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite materials, owing to their outstanding photophysical properties, have been extensively investigated in the fields of solar cells.1–4 However, the stability issue of these three-dimensional organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites hindered their commercialization, which is due to the volatility of organic molecules such as methylammonium (MA) and formamidinium (FA), or the phase instability of FAPbI3-based perovskites for high-efficiency perovskite solar cells (PSCs).5–9
Quasi two-dimensional (quasi-2D) or two/three-dimensional (2D/3D) mixed organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites have been widely employed for improving the stability of PSCs.10–12 They adopt a general R2An−1BnX3n+1 formula, where R is an additional bulky organic cation (such as an aliphatic or aromatic alkylammonium), A is a monovalent cation (for example, MA = methylammonium, FA = formamidinium or Cs+), B is a metal cation (Pb2+ or Sn2+) and X is a halide anion (Cl−, Br− or I−). In the crystal structure, R+ acts as a spacer layer between the inorganic sheets and n defines the number of inorganic sheets.13 In the R2An−1BnX3n+1 formula, n represents the stoichiometry of the components. The n ≥ 2 stoichiometry of the components leads to the formation of phase mixtures of different n values.14–18 The introduction of R+ can stabilize the FAPbI3-based perovskite phase by the formation of stable quasi-2D or 2D/3D perovskites.19
By replacing volatile organic components with inorganic cations, all-inorganic perovskites CsPb(I/Br)3 are particularly attractive as photoactive semiconductors to improve the stability of PSCs.4,20–22 The desirable cubic α-phase (“black phase”) of the narrow bandgap material such as CsPbI3 spontaneously transforms to the orthorhombic, more thermodynamically stable δ-phase (“yellow phase”) at room temperature.23 R+ can also stabilize the CsPbI3 perovskite phase by forming low-dimensional R2Csn−1PbnI3n+1 perovskites which is not an all-inorganic perovskite in a strict sense and would sacrifice some advantages of all-inorganic perovskites.24–28
All-inorganic quasi-2D or 2D/3D mixed perovskites have the potential to be employed in solar cells, light-emitting diodes, and detectors by combining the advantages of quasi-2D or 2D/3D mixed organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites and all-inorganic perovskites. This is still in its infancy. Here, we report a series of all inorganic 2D/3D halide perovskite materials, Csx+2Pbx+1(SCN)2(I/Br)3x+2. We found that there are only 2D Cs2Pb(SCN)2(I/Br)2 and 3D CsPb(I/Br)3 perovskite phases in Csx+2Pbx+1(SCN)2(I/Br)3x+2 (x = 1, 2, 3), (here x defines the ratio of 3D CsPb(I/Br)3 and 2D Cs2Pb(SCN)2(I/Br)2 perovskite phases) (Fig. 1), which is very different with low-dimensional R2An−1BnX3n+1 perovskite with a mixed phase of different n values. Based on the optimized morphology from PbAc2 additives and the surface passivation of hexadecyltrimethylammonium iodide (CTAI), the devices based on Csx+2Pbx+1(SCN)2I3x+2 (x = 3) achieve a PCE of 8.1%.

Results and discussion
Structures and optical properties of Csx+2Pbx+1(SCN)2I3x+2
According to X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements of the Csx+2Pbx+1(SCN)2I3x+2 (x = 0) film, the characteristic peaks at 2θ = 9.86° and 19.77° belong to (002) and (004) diffraction peaks of 2D Cs2Pb(SCN)2I2 perovskite, which is consistent with previous reports.28 Meanwhile, these XRD patterns from Csx+2Pbx+1(SCN)2I3x+2 (x = 1, 2, 3) films shows the diffraction peaks of 2D Cs2Pb(SCN)2I2 perovskite phase at 9.86° and 19.77°, and 3D CsPbI3 perovskite phase at 14.40° and 20.38°, without the diffraction peaks of other low-dimensional perovskites with different inorganic sheets. Thus, there are only 2D Cs2Pb(SCN)2I2 and 3D CsPbI3 perovskite phases in Csx+2Pbx+1(SCN)2I3x+2 (x = 1, 2, 3) (Fig. 2a). Based on the stoichiometric proportion, x represents the ratio of 3D CsPb(I/Br)3 and 2D Cs2Pb(SCN)2(I/Br)2 perovskite phases as shown in Fig. 1. This is different with R2An−1BnX3n+1 perovskites with mixed phases of different inorganic sheets.29

The UV-vis absorption spectrum of Cs2Pb(SCN)2I2 in Fig. 2b shows a sharp absorption cut-off edge at 610 nm, which indicates a band gap (Eg) of 2.02 eV. Besides, the spectrum possesses an absorption peak at 573 nm, which was considered to come from the quantum confinement of charge carriers with the generation of 2D layered semiconductors.28,30 The absorption peak at 573 nm also exists in the UV-vis absorption spectrum of Csx+2Pbx+1(SCN)2I3x+2 (x = 1, 2, 3) film, which results from the Cs2Pb(SCN)2I2 phase. Their absorption cut-off edges for Csx+2Pbx+1(SCN)2I3x+2 (x = 1, 2, 3) film are at ∼720 nm (Eg = ∼1.72 eV), which results from CsPbI3 phase. Thus, UV-vis absorption spectra further show that Csx+2Pbx+1(SCN)2I3x+2 (x = 1, 2, 3) films include 2D perovskite Cs2Pb(SCN)2I2 and 3D CsPbI3 phases, which is consistent with the XRD results.
The steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectrum of the Cs2Pb(SCN)2I2 film in Fig. 2c shows a weak emission peak at 583 nm and a strong emission peak at 682 nm. The first one is in accordance with the absorption cut-off edge of the UV spectrum of the Cs2Pb(SCN)2I2 film, so it is attributed to the optical bandgap peak. The latter is considered to be defect peaks.28 The PL spectrum of Csx+2Pbx+1(SCN)2I3x+2 (x = 1, 2, 3) films all shows two emission peaks 583 nm and ∼720 nm. The first at the 583 nm results from the Cs2Pb(SCN)2I2 phase. The latter at the ∼720 nm is consistent with the absorption cut-off edge of the CsPbI3 phase, which is contributed to the optical bandgap peak of the CsPbI3 phase. The little shift (<5 nm) of the PL position between Csx+2Pbx+1(SCN)2I3x+2 (x = 1, 2, 3) films is contributed to the different defect concentration.31
Morphologies of perovskite films

Fig. 3a–d shows the top-view scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of Csx+2Pbx+1(SCN)2I3x+2 (x = 0, 1, 2, 3) perovskite films. The Cs2Pb(SCN)2I2 film shows a good uniform with a large domain of ∼50 μm. As the increase of x in Csx+2Pbx+1(SCN)2I3x+2 (x = 1, 2, 3) films, the roughness of these films increases. The Csx+2Pbx+1(SCN)2I3x+2 (x = 3) film exists a lot of pinholes which seriously affect the efficiency of PSCs.32

To improve the morphology, a small amount of Pb(Ac)2 (Pb(Ac)2:PbI2 = 0.03) as an additive is introduced into the precursors. The SEM images in Fig. 3e–h show the Csx+2Pbx+1(SCN)2I3x+2 (n = 1, 2, 3) films with Pb(Ac)2 are uniform and compact. Cs2Pb(SCN)2I2 film with Pb(Ac)2 additive also achieves full coverage to the substrate. The energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) elemental mapping of surface and cross-section for Csx+2Pbx+1(SCN)2I3x+2 (x = 3) shows a uniform distribution of elements in the perovskite film (Fig. S1 and S2, ESI†).
XRD patterns, UV-vis spectra and PL spectra of Csx+2Pbx+1(SCN)2I3x+2 (x = 0, 1, 2, 3) films with Pb(Ac)2 additive in Fig. S3–S5 (ESI†) also show that Csx+2Pbx+1(SCN)2I3x+2 (x = 1, 2, 3) films with the Pb(Ac)2 additive only include 2D Cs2Pb(SCN)2I2 and 3D CsPbI3 perovskite phases, which is consistent with the films without the Pb(Ac)2 additive. The Csx+2Pbx+1(SCN)2I3x+2 (x = 1, 2, 3) films with Pb(Ac)2 additive show a strong orientation of 3D perovskites compared to those without Pb(Ac)2 additive.
Photovoltaic performance
Based on the perovskite films with Pb(Ac)2 additive, we fabricated the PSCs with a configuration of ITO/compact tin oxide (c-SnO2)/Csx+2Pbx+1(SCN)2I3x+2 (x = 0, 1, 2, 3)/2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis (N,N-di-p-methoxyphenyl-amine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD)/Au. The JV curves show that the efficiency of x = 3 device is highest among of them, which mainly results from the increasing short-circuit current density (Jsc) and fill factor (FF) (Fig. 4a). The integrated photocurrent densities from the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra are matched with the Jsc values of J–V curves (Fig. 4b). The performance distribution of Csx+2Pbx+1(SCN)2I3x+2 (x = 0, 1, 2, 3) devices also show the same trend with the JV curves (Fig. 4c). We further improve the efficiency of Csx+2Pbx+1(SCN)2I3x+2 (x = 3) devices to 8.1% with a Jsc of 13.2 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 990 mV, and a FF of 61.66% in reverse scan by surface passivation of CTAI (Fig. 4d and Table S1, ESI†), which have been reported in our previous work.23 The stabilized power output (SPO) efficiency is ∼7.88% (Fig. 4e). The Csx+2Pbx+1(SCN)2I3x+2 (x = 3) device shows better stability than the CsPbI3 perovskite device based on the maximum power point tracking at room temperature under N2 atmosphere (Fig. S6, ESI†).

Halide roles in 2D/3D inorganic perovskites
Based on Csx+2Pbx+1(SCN)2(I/Br)3x+2 (x = 3) 2D/3D inorganic perovskites, we fabricated the films with different halide ratios, I:Br = 1:0, 0.75:0.25, 0.5:0.5, 0.25:0.75, 0:1. Their XRD patterns in Fig. 5a show that these films consist of 2D Cs2Pb(SCN)2(I/Br)2 and 3D CsPb(I/Br)3 perovskite phases. The peak positions of (200) of 2D Cs2Pb(SCN)2(I/Br)2 perovskites are almost unchanged with increasing Br content, which indicates the interplanar distance of (200) is decided by (SCN)− rather than I or Br. The diffraction peaks of 3D perovskites obviously shift to higher angles with the increase of Br content, which indicates that the introduction of Br− leads to the decrease of interplanar distance.

The UV-vis spectra of Csx+2Pbx+1(SCN)2(I/Br)3x+2 (x = 3) films with I:Br = 1:0, 0.75:0.25, 0.5:0.5, 0.25:0.75, 0:1 in Fig. 5b show that the absorption cut-off edges from 3D perovskites blueshift from 720 nm of pure I to 540 nm of pure Br, and the absorption peak from 2D perovskites also blueshift from 610 nm of pure I to 480 nm of pure Br. Their PL spectra all show two emission peaks: a weak emission peak at short wavelength and a strong emission peak at long wavelength (Fig. 5c). The first emission peaks from 2D perovskites blueshift from 583 nm of pure I to 460 nm of pure Br, and the latter from 3D perovskites blueshift from ∼720 nm of pure I to 525 nm of pure Br.
Additionally, we also investigated pure bromide 3D/2D all-inorganic perovskite Csx+2Pbx+1(SCN)2Br3x+2. Their XRD patterns, UV-vis absorption spectra, and PL spectra show the similar phenomenon with these of pure iodide 3D/2D all-inorganic perovskite Csx+2Pbx+1(SCN)2I3x+2 as shown in Fig. S7 (ESI†). Csx+2Pbx+1(SCN)2Br3x+2 (x = 1, 2, 3) films consist of 2D Cs2Pb(SCN)2Br2 and 3D CsPbBr3 perovskite phases.
Conclusion
Overall, we have investigated a series of all inorganic 2D/3D halide perovskite materials, Csx+2Pbx+1(SCN)2(I/Br)3x+2. From the comprehensive characterization of all-inorganic Csx+2Pbx+1(SCN)2(I/Br)3x+2 (x = 0, 1, 2, 3), we found that such materials only include the 2D Cs2Pb(SCN)2(I/Br)2 and 3D CsPb(I/Br)3 perovskite phases, which is different with low-dimensional R2An−1BnX3n+1 perovskite with a mixed phase of different inorganic sheets. The champion efficiency of the optimized device based on the Pb(Ac)2 additive and CTAI passivation is 8.1%. The all-inorganic 2D/3D mixed Csx+2Pbx+1(SCN)2X3x+2 (x = 0, 1, 2, 3) perovskites with these special properties have huge potential in solar cells, light-emitting diodes, and detectors.
