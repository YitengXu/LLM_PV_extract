    , Accepted 3rd April 2015First published on 8th April 2015AbstractIn this study, four new pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-dione (DKPP)-based polymers, P(DKPP-TPTH), P(DKPP-TPTE), P(DKPP-TPTA), and P(DKPP-TPTI), containing N-alkyl-2,5-di(2-thienyl)pyrrole (TPT) derivatives with four different substituents such as hydrogen, ester, amide, and imide groups on the 3,4-position of the pyrrole unit were prepared to tune the properties of the polymers. Opto-electrical studies showed that the incorporation of electron withdrawing substituents such as ester, amide and imide groups instead of hydrogen into the pyrrole backbone of the polymers increased the band gaps significantly from 1.31 eV to 1.42 eV, 1.37 eV and 1.37 eV, respectively, and reduced the highest occupied/lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (HOMO/LUMO) energy levels from −4.96 eV/−3.65 eV to −5.24 eV/−3.82 eV, −5.17 eV/−3.80 eV and −5.35 eV/−3.98 eV, respectively. Organic field effect transistors (OFETs) made from these polymers indicated that the incorporation of electron withdrawing functional groups into the polymer backbone reduced hole mobility. Polymer solar cells (PSCs) prepared using polymers as electron donors offered higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) for the polymer containing hydrogen on the TPT backbone, but the polymers incorporating electron withdrawing substituents into the TPT backbone showed a significantly higher open-circuit voltage (Voc) though the PCE was relatively low.
Introduction
The recent progress of polymer solar cells (PSCs) has revealed them to be the most promising green energy production technique because of their high solar to electrical energy conversion efficiency via the easy device fabrication of large area solar cells at low cost.1–3 The photoactive layer of the PSCs is usually made from an interpenetrating network of electron donating π-conjugated polymers and electron accepting fullerene derivatives. Numerous π-conjugated polymers4–9 and fullerene derivatives10–12 have been reported for PSCs over the last decade. Note that the polymer and fullerene derivatives used in the photoactive layer of PSCs, the device structure and its preparation conditions are crucial factors determining the performance of PSCs. In this instance, chemists are looking forward to developing highly efficient donor or acceptor materials and physicists are working more on the device optimization of PSCs to improve the PCE further. Currently, single junction PSCs made from single donor and acceptor materials offer the maximum PCE in the range of 8–9.5%,13–18 whereas multijunction or tandem PSCs prepared with two different donor and acceptor materials provide a relatively higher PCE of 9–11.5%.1,19–21
Since 2010, the authors have been involved in the preparation of highly efficient 2,5-di(2-thienyl)pyrrole (TPT)-based polymeric donor materials for PSCs.22–29 In the beginning of these studies, TPT was utilized as an electron donor unit and TPT-based polymers containing electron rich indenofluorene,22 2,5-dioctyloxyphenylene23 and 3-octylthiophene23 or electron accepting benzothiadiazole,24–26 thiophene–benzothiadiazole–thiophene (TBT),27,28 and thiadiazoloquinoxaline (DQ)29 were developed for PSCs. The opto-electrical and photovoltaic studies showed that the properties of TPT-based polymers varied considerably according to the electron-rich or -deficient units incorporated into their main chain. However all polymers showed poor photovoltaic performances (∼1–2%) mainly due to the lower open-circuit voltage (Voc ∼ 0.4–0.5 V) and the fill factor (FF ∼ 30–40%).22–29 The Voc and FF are dependent mainly on the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level and the carrier mobility of electron donating polymers. In an effort to lower the HOMO level as well as to improve the mobility of TPT-based polymers, more recently we incorporated electron accepting imide groups in the 3,4-position of pyrrole of the TPT unit (pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,3-dione (TDPPDT)) and copolymerized it with electron rich benzodithiophene (BDT and BDTT) derivatives to afford structurally new donor–acceptor (D–A) large band gap polymers, namely P(BDT-TDPPDT) and P(BDTT-TDPPDT).30–32 The chemical structures of P(BDT-TDPPDT) and P(BDTT-TDPPDT) are presented in Fig. 1. As expected, the HOMO energy levels of the polymers P(BDT-TDPPDT) and P(BDTT-TDPPDT) were found to be 0.2–0.4 eV deeper than those of TPT-based polymers incorporating TPT as the donor unit.22–29
 Fig. 1  Structures of known polymers P(BDT-TDPPDT), P(BDTT-TDPPDT) and new polymers prepared in this study. 
The PSC made from a blend of P(BDT-TDPPDT):PC70BM gave a record PCE of 6.74% with a greatly improved open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.86 V, a short-circuit current (Jsc) of 10.94 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 71%. The PSC prepared from a blend of P(BDTT-TDPPDT):PC70BM also exhibited a high PCE of 6.57% with Voc, Jsc and FF of 0.90 V, 10.12 mA cm−2 and 72%, respectively. Although P(BDT-TDPPDT) and P(BDTT-TDPPDT) exhibit a wide band gap (Eg ∼ 2.11 and 2.04 eV, respectively), still they produce a high PCE in single layer PSCs.30–32 The incorporation of an imide group into the TPT backbone was found to improve the Voc and the FF significantly and consequently, the PCE of TPT-based polymers. To improve the PCE of P(BDT-TDPPDT), an electron deficient thiophene-based imide functionalized thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione (TPD) unit was incorporated randomly in the P(BDT-TDPPDT) main chain to offer a random polymer.33 Interestingly, the PSC made from the random polymer was found to give an enhanced PCE of 7.03% with a relatively high Jsc (∼11.52 mA cm−2) compared to the PSC prepared from P(BDT-TDPPDT).33
The recently reported alternating polymer, P(DKPP-TPD), containing pyrrole-based lactam functionalized pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-dione (DKPP) and TPD units displayed a narrow band gap (1.42 eV) and high PCE (5.3%).34 Just changing the TPD in P(DKPP-TPD) with TDPPDT is expected to offer a freely soluble polymer via the incorporation of alkyl groups into the pyrrole as well as imide nitrogen of the TDPPDT unit. The solubility of the polymer is also essential for PSCs owing to its solution processability. In addition, P(DKPP-TPD) is an acceptor–acceptor (A–A) type of polymer, and the photovoltaic performance of the A–A polymer is usually lower than that of donor–acceptor (D–A) polymers. TDPPDT is a relatively weak electron acceptor unit compared to TPD due to the intrinsic electron-rich character of pyrrole on the DPPD unit. Consequently, the polymerization of the pyrrole-based imide functionalized pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,3-dione (TDPPDT)32,33 unit with its structural isomer, such as DKPP, might offer a lower band gap polymer than P(DKPP-TPD) due to the improved internal charge transfer between the donor–acceptor units along with better solubility. In this study, polymer P(DKPP-TPTI) containing DKPP and TDPPDT was prepared. In addition, to clarify the effect of substituents on the properties of polymers, three more polymers containing DKPP and TPT derivatives with hydrogen, esters and amides on the 3,4-position of the pyrrole unit were prepared. The molecular structures of new polymers are presented in Fig. 1. This paper reports the synthesis, opto-electrical, charge transport and photovoltaic properties of four new DKPP-based polymers containing TPT units with different substituents on the pyrrole unit.
Experimental section
Materials and measurements
All necessary reagents and solvents were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich or TCI chemicals. The reagents were used as received and the solvents were handled in a moisture-free atmosphere. Purification of the compounds was performed by column chromatography (silica gel, Merck Kieselgel 60, 70–230 mesh ASTM). The nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were recorded using a Varian Mercury Plus spectrometer (300 MHz for 1H and 75 MHz for 13C NMR) and the high resolution fast atom bombardment (FAB) mass spectra were analyzed using a JEOL JMS-700 mass spectrometer. An Agilent 1200 Infinity Series separation module was used to determine the molecular weight of the polymers by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) with chloroform as an eluent at ambient temperature. The GPC instrument was calibrated with the polystyrene standard prior to analysis. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of the polymer was performed on a TA instrument Q600-0825 at a heating and cooling rate of 10 °C min−1 in nitrogen. The UV-visible absorption spectra of the polymers in the solution and the film state were recorded on a JASCO V-570 spectrophotometer and a CH Instruments Electrochemical Analyzer was used for cyclic voltammetry (CV) of the polymers. The polymer cast film on the platinum working electrode was immersed in an acetonitrile solution containing 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium tetrafluoroborate (Bu4NBF4), Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode and platinum wire as a counter electrode and then the measurements were taken. For CV, the instrument was calibrated with the most common ferrocene/ferrocenium ion (Fc/Fc+) standard. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was performed using Seiko instruments (SPI 3800N-SPA 400).
Device fabrication and characterization of OFETs
Organic field effect transistors (OFETs) were fabricated on highly n-type-doped silicon (Si) substrates with a 200 nm thermally grown silicon oxide (SiO2) layer. The Si substrates were subjected to the UV-ozone treatment for 30 min and treated with an octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS) self-assembled monolayer. The n-type doped Si substrate functions as a gate electrode and the SiO2 layer acts as a gate dielectric. The CB solution of the polymer (10 mg mL−1) was spin-cast on top of the Si substrate (2000 rpm) and then dried at room temperature (RT) for 30 minutes. The source and drain electrodes (Au, 70 nm) were deposited on top of the polymer layer by thermal evaporation under a vacuum (∼2 × 10−6 Torr). The channel length (L) and the channel width (W) of the device was 50 μm and 3.0 mm, respectively. The output and transfer characteristics of the OFETs were measured using a Keithley semiconductor parametric analyzer (Keithley 4200). All preparation processes and the characterization of the OFETs were performed inside a N2-atmosphere glove box. The mobility (μ) was determined using the following equation in the saturation regime:IDS,sat = (−WCi/2L) (VGS − VT)2where Ci is the capacitance per unit area of the SiO2 dielectric (Ci = 15 nF cm−2) and VT is the threshold voltage.
Device fabrication and characterization of PSCs
The PSCs were fabricated with the simple device structure of ITO-coated glass substrate/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC70BM/Al. The pre-cleaned ITO-coated glass substrate was dried overnight in an oven. Subsequently, a 40 nm thick layer of PEDOT:PSS (Baytron PH) was spin-cast from aqueous solution on the ITO-coated glass substrate. The substrate was dried for 10 min at 140 °C in air and then transferred to a glove box to spin-cast the photoactive layer. A solution containing a mixture of polymer:PC70BM (1:1, 1:2 and 1:3 wt%) in dichlorobenzene (DCB) at a concentration of 20 mg mL−1 was then spin-cast on top of the PEDOT/PSS layer. For the device made with 1,8-diiodoctane (DIO), the polymer:PC70BM blends were dissolved in DCB:DIO (98:2 vol%). The thickness of the photoactive layer was 80 nm and the film was dried for 30 min at RT in a glove box. Subsequently, an aluminium (Al, 100 nm) electrode was deposited by thermal evaporation under a vacuum (∼3 × 10−6 Torr). The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the PSC devices were measured using a Keithley 2400 Source Measure Unit. The solar cell performance utilized an Air Mass 1.5 Global (AM 1.5 G) solar simulator with an irradiation intensity of 1000 W m−2. The spectral mismatch factor was calculated by comparing the solar simulator spectrum with the AM 1.5 spectrum at room temperature.

General synthetic procedure for the synthesis of the polymers
A flame-dried three-neck round bottom flask containing a solution of the respective distannyl (0.40 mmol) and dibromo (0.40 mmol) monomers shown in Scheme 2 in chlorobenzene (20 mL) was purged well with argon for 30 min. Subsequently, Pd2(dba)3 (14 mg) and P(o-tol)3 (30 mg) were added and the entire mixture was heated under reflux in argon for 24 h. The solution was cooled to RT and the solution was added dropwise to methanol (250 mL) with constant stirring. The precipitated polymer was then allowed to settle. The precipitates were filtered and subjected to Soxhlet extraction with methanol and acetone for 24 h. The resulting polymer was dissolved in chloroform (20 mL) and filtered. The polymer was again precipitated by adding methanol (250 mL). The precipitates were filtered and dried under vacuum to afford the pure polymer as a blue solid.

Results and discussions
Synthesis and characterization

Schemes 1 and 2 show the synthetic route for new monomers and polymers, respectively. Monomers M130 and M235 were prepared according to the known literature procedures and monomer M3 was purchased (Cat # IN1346, purity ∼ 98%) from Suna Tech Inc. On the other hand, new monomers, such as M4, M5 and M6, were synthesized as described in the experimental section. All four new polymers, P(DKPP-TPTH), P(DKPP-TPTE), P(DKPP-TPTA) and P(DKPP-TPTI), were prepared via the Stille polycondensation between the respective monomers shown in Scheme 2. The weight average molecular weights (Mw) of the polymers estimated by GPC analysis were 1.54 × 104 g mol−1, 2.61 × 104 g mol−1, 2.63 × 104 g mol−1, and 3.47 × 104 g mol−1 with polydispersity values (PDI) of 1.68, 1.72, 1.86, and 2.37, respectively. The solubility of the polymers was good in chlorinated solvents, such as chloroform, chlorobenzene and dichlorobenzene. In particular, polymers P(DKPP-TPTE), P(DKPP-TPTA) and P(DKPP-TPTI) exhibited better solubility than P(DKPP-TPTH). The 5% weight loss temperatures of the polymers determined by TGA were 300 °C, 280 °C, 270 °C, and 330 °C, respectively.

Optical properties
The absorption spectra of polymers P(DKPP-TPTH), P(DKPP-TPTE), P(DKPP-TPTA) and P(DKPP-TPTI) recorded in a chloroform solution and as a thin film on glass are displayed in Fig. 2. The maximum absorption peak of P(DKPP-TPTH), P(DKPP-TPTE), P(DKPP-TPTA) and P(DKPP-TPTI) was observed at 659 nm, 634 nm, 650 nm, and 658 nm, respectively, in solution, and 702 nm, 655 nm, 671 nm, and 700 nm, respectively, in the film state. All four polymers shifted their absorption bands to red in the film compared to those in solution, which suggests that the π–π stacking of the polymers is enhanced in the film state. The optical band gaps (Eg) of P(DKPP-TPTH), P(DKPP-TPTE), P(DKPP-TPTA), and P(DKPP-TPTI) were calculated from the onset absorption wavelength in the film state as 1.31 eV, 1.42 eV, 1.37 eV, and 1.37 eV, respectively. As expected, copolymerization of the TPT derivatives with the DKPP unit produced low band gap polymers compared to P(BDT-TDPPDT) and P(BDTT-TDPPDT).31,32
 Fig. 2  UV-visible absorption spectra of polymers in chloroform (a), as thin film (b) and the optimized structures of TPT derivatives (c). 
The incorporation of electron withdrawing groups into the pyrrole backbone of the polymers (P(DKPP-TPTE), P(DKPP-TPTA) and P(DKPP-TPTI)) is expected to decrease the polymer planarity and reduce the internal charge transfer (ICT) from the donor to acceptor unit and consequently produce a blue shift in the absorption band compared to polymer P(DKPP-TPTH) containing hydrogen on the pyrrole backbone. The planarity of the TPT units shown in Fig. 2c, i.e., TPTH, TPTE, TPTA and TPTI containing hydrogen, ester, amide, and cyclic imide functional groups on the 3,4-position of the pyrrole unit, respectively, was found to be in the order, TPTI ∼ TPTH > TPTA > TPTE, from their optimized structures (see Fig. 2c). The incorporation of a cyclic imide group into the pyrrole group of the TPT unit (TPTI) showed similar dihedral angles, whereas the incorporation of acyclic amide (TPTA) or ester groups (TPTE) showed higher dihedral angles between the thiophenes and the pyrrole compared to that of the TPT unit containing hydrogen ontheir backbone (TPTH). Consequently, the absorption maximum of the polymers was found to be in the order of P(DKPP-TPTE) < P(DKPP-TPTA) < P(DKPP-TPTI) < P(DKPP-TPTH). Note that P(DKPP-TPTI) showed a blue shift in the absorption band compared to P(DKPP-TPTH) though TPTI exhibited a similar planarity to that of TPTH. The presence of an electron withdrawing imide group on the TPT backbone of P(DKPP-TPTI) is expected to decrease the ICT from TPTI to DKPP compared to that from TPTH to DKPP, which leads to a blue shift in the absorption band. The latter results suggest that both the planarity and the electron accepting ability of the substituents in the TPT unit have a significant effect on the absorption of the final polymers. Similar trends have also been observed for TPT-based polymers and organic dyes containing substituents on the pyrrole backbone of the TPT unit.36–38 Optical studies of the new polymers suggest that the incorporation of electron withdrawing substituents such as, ester, amide and imide groups into the TPT unit alter the absorption of the final polymers significantly. The absorption maxima and optical band gaps of the polymers are summarized in Table 1.

Electrochemical properties
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed on each polymer in a three-electrode electrochemical system, as mentioned in the experimental section. The CV curves of the polymers are presented in Fig. 3. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of the polymers were estimated using the standard equations, EHOMO = [−(Eox,onsetvs.Ag/AgCl − Eferrocenevs.Ag/AgCl) − 4.8] eV and ELUMO = EHOMO + Eg, respectively. The value, 4.8 eV, represents the energy level of ferrocene below the vacuum level, Eferrocenevs.Ag/AgCl is 0.46 V, and Eox,onset is the onset potential values of the polymers in volts for oxidation processes against the Ag/AgCl reference electrode. The calculated HOMO/LUMO levels of polymers P(DKPP-TPTH), P(DKPP-TPTE), P(DKPP-TPTA), and P(DKPP-TPTI) were −4.96 eV/−3.65 eV, −5.24 eV/−3.82 eV, −5.17 eV/−3.80 eV, and −5.35 eV/−3.98 eV, respectively, from the estimated Eox,onset (0.62 V, 0.90 V, 0.83 V, and 1.01 V, respectively) and band gaps of the polymers. The energy levels of the polymers confirmed that the incorporation of electron withdrawing substituents into the polymer backbone lowers their HOMO/LUMO levels significantly. In particular, the incorporation of a cyclic imide group into the pyrrole backbone of the TPT unit showed more pronounced effect than the incorporation of an acyclic ester or amide groups in terms of lowering the HOMO/LUMO levels of the polymers.
 Fig. 3  Cyclic voltammograms of polymers. 
The electrochemical studies of the polymers show that the HOMO levels of polymers P(DKPP-TPTE), P(DKPP-TPTA) and P(DKPP-TPTI) were found to be deeper than that of P(DKPP-TPTH). Consequently, those polymers are expected to provide a higher Voc than P(DKPP-TPTH) because the Voc is defined as the energy difference between the HOMO and LUMO levels of the polymer and PC70BM.24,25 On the other hand, although P(DKPP-TPTI) is expected to offer higher Voc than all other polymers, it may show poor photovoltaic performance because of the very low energy difference (∼0.32 eV) between the LUMO levels of P(DKPP-TPTI) and PC70BM.24,25 The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the polymers are included in Table 1.
Organic field effect transistor characteristics
The field-effect mobilities (μ) of polymers P(DKPP-TPTH), P(DKPP-TPTE), P(DKPP-TPTA), and P(DKPP-TPTI) were estimated from the OFET characteristics shown in Fig. 4 to be 4 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, 5 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1, 2 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, and 2 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The hole mobility of the polymers decreased significantly when the electron withdrawing groups were introduced into the pyrrole backbone of the polymers. In addition, the mobility of each polymer increased as the planarity of the polymer backbone was enhanced (see Fig. 2c). Therefore, the planarity of the polymers might affect the carrier mobility, and consequently, polymers P(DKPP-TPTH) and P(DKPP-TPTI) have a similar hole mobility, but polymers P(DKPP-TPTE) and P(DKPP-TPTA) containing sterically hindered substituents on the polymer backbone showed lower mobility. All four polymers were typically amorphous according to XRD, as shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). Consequently, the mobility of the polymers related to crystallinity might be ignored. This paper reports the preliminary OFET device results and the values are expected to improve by working more on the device fabrication.

Photovoltaic properties
The photovoltaic properties of the polymers were examined by preparing PSCs with each of polymers P(DKPP-TPTH), P(DKPP-TPTE), P(DKPP-TPTA), and P(DKPP-TPTI) as electron donors and PC70BM as an electron acceptor at three different donor:acceptor ratios (1:1 wt%, 1:2 wt% and 1:3 wt%). The device configuration of the PSCs is ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC70BM/Al. The device optimization results for each polymer are shown in Fig. S2–S5 and Tables S1–S4 (ESI†). The device structure and energy levels of materials used in the PSCs are displayed in Fig. 5a. Among the PSCs prepared, the maximum photovoltaic performance was obtained for the PSCs made with the donor: acceptor blends of P(DKPP-TPTH):PC70BM (1:2 wt%), P(DKPP-TPTE):PC70BM (1:2 wt%), P(DKPP-TPTA):PC70BM (1:3 wt%) and P(DKPP-TPTI):PC70BM (1:3 wt%). The J–V curves of the PSCs made from the abovementioned blends are shown in Fig. 5b and their results, such as the open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current (Jsc), fill factor (FF) and power conversion efficiency (PCE) are summarized in Table 2.

The J–V curves of the PSCs were measured under the illumination of an AM 1.5 G (1000 W m−2) solar simulator. The PSC made from the P(DKPP-TPTH):PC70BM (1:2 wt%) blend offered a maximum PCE of 2.63% with a Voc of 0.56 V, a Jsc of 7.98 mA cm−2, and a FF of 59%, whereas the PSCs prepared from the P(DKPP-TPTE):PC70BM (1:2 wt%), P(DKPP-TPTA):PC70BM (1:3 wt%) and P(DKPP-TPTI):PC70BM (1:3 wt%) blends gave relatively low PCEs of 0.90% (Voc ∼ 0.75 V, Jsc ∼ 3.92 mA cm−2, and FF ∼ 31%), 0.70% (Voc ∼ 0.66 V, Jsc ∼ 3.00 mA cm−2, and FF ∼ 35%) and 0.91% (Voc ∼ 0.81 V, Jsc ∼ 2.26 mA cm−2, and FF ∼ 50%), respectively.
All three polymers, P(DKPP-TPTE), P(DKPP-TPTA) and P(DKPP-TPTI), incorporating electron withdrawing substituents into the pyrrole backbone showed similar performance, but their performance was relatively low than that of polymer P(DKPP-TPTH) containing hydrogen on the pyrrole backbone. Polymer P(DKPP-TPTH) is a donor–acceptor (D–A) type of polymer because it is composed of electron rich TPT and electron deficient DKPP units, whereas polymers, P(DKPP-TPTE), P(DKPP-TPTA) and P(DKPP-TPTI), are expected to be acceptor–acceptor (A–A) type polymers because the presence of electron withdrawing substituents in the pyrrole unit makes TPT a weak acceptor unit. In general, the photovoltaic performance of A–A type polymers34,39–42 offered a relatively low PCE than those of D–A type polymers13–18 though the opto-electrical properties of A–A type polymers are good. However, A–A type polymers had not attracted a great deal of attention previously but they have recently attracted interest for their applications in PSCs34,39–42 and thin film transistors.43–48
The Voc of the PSCs made from the polymers was in the order of P(DKPP-TPTI) > P(DKPP-TPTE) > P(DKPP-TPTA) > P(DKPP-TPTH), and the estimated HOMO energy levels of the polymers were also found to be deeper in the same order. On the other hand, the Jsc values were expected to be in the order of P(DKPP-TPTH) > P(DKPP-TPTI) > P(DKPP-TPTA) > P(DKPP-TPTE) according to the absorption spectra of the polymers, but the actual Jsc values were in the order of P(DKPP-TPTH) > P(DKPP-TPTE) > P(DKPP-TPTA) > P(DKPP-TPTI). Usually, the Jsc values are correlated with the light harvesting ability and carrier mobility of the polymer, charge separation at the D–A interface and charge collection at their respective electrodes.34,49,50 Although P(DKPP-TPTI) exhibits better absorption and mobility than P(DKPP-TPTE) and P(DKPP-TPTA), the low energy difference (∼0.3 eV) between the LUMO levels of P(DKPP-TPTI) and PC70BM might lower the charge separation and collection34 and, consequently, produce a lower Jsc than P(DKPP-TPTE) and P(DKPP-TPTA). On the other hand, the lower Jsc values obtained for P(DKPP-TPTE) and P(DKPP-TPTA) compared to that of P(DKPP-TPTH) might be due to their lower mobility and the morphological differences of the photoactive layers.
The decreased Jsc values of the PSCs made from polymers P(DKPP-TPTE), P(DKPP-TPTA) and P(DKPP-TPTI) compared to that of P(DKPP-TPTH) were confirmed by the incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE) spectra of the PSCs shown in Fig. 5c. The IPCE spectra of the PSCs were recorded in the range 300–800 nm, and the PSCs made from the P(DKPP-TPTH):PC70BM (1:2 wt%) blend displayed a broad photoresponse from 300 nm to over 800 nm. On the other hand, the PSCs made from the P(DKPP-TPTE):PC70BM (1:2 wt%), P(DKPP-TPTA):PC70BM (1:3 wt%) and P(DKPP-TPTI):PC70BM (1:3 wt%) blends displayed relatively narrow responses between 300 nm and 750 nm with lower IPCE maxima compared to that of the P(DKPP-TPTH)-based PSC. These results suggest that the incorporation of electron withdrawing substituents into the TPT-based polymer backbone decreases the electron donating ability to PC70BM significantly due to their blue shifted absorption band and the lower LUMO level, but at the same time, produces a higher Voc due to the deeper HOMO levels of the polymers.
Sometimes the processive additives, such as DIO and 1-chloronaphtalene, improve the PSC device performance significantly due to the improved surface morphology of the photoactive layer. To examine the additive influence on the performance of the PSCs, the PSCs were prepared from the P(DKPP-TPTH):PC70BM (1:2 wt%), P(DKPP-TPTE):PC70BM (1:2 wt%), P(DKPP-TPTA):PC70BM (1:3 wt%), and P(DKPP-TPTI):PC70BM (1:3 wt%) blends along with 2 vol% DIO. Unfortunately, all four PSCs showed lower PCEs than the device prepared without DIO. The corresponding J–V curves of the PSCs are shown in Fig. 5d and their photovoltaic parameters are included in Table 2.
AFM of polymer:PC70BM blends without and with 2 vol% DIO was performed to understand the reason for the decreased PCE for the PSCs made with DIO compared to that of the PSCs prepared without DIO as well as to obtain greater insight into the substituent effects on the photoactive layer morphology. AFM images without and with 2 vol% DIO are shown in Fig. 6a–d, respectively, with their roughness. Fig. 6a and c were obtained in the tapping mode, whereas Fig. 6b and d were obtained in the phase mode. The AFM images confirmed that the film made with DIO had a poor interpenetrating network between the donor and acceptor molecules as well as a higher root mean square surface roughness than the corresponding films prepared without DIO. Consequently, PSCs made with DIO showed poorer performance than the PSCs made without DIO. To gain more insight into the substituent effect of the TPT unit on the surface morphology of the photoactive layers, 1 × 1μ phase mode AFM images were recorded for the films made from the polymer:PC70BM blends without and with 2 vol% DIO and are presented in Fig. 7. Interestingly, the films prepared from the P(DKPP-TPTE):PC70BM (1:2 wt%) and P(DKPP-TPTA):PC70BM (1:3 wt%) blends showed the aggregation of PC70BM while P(DKPP-TPTH):PC70BM (1:2 wt%) and P(DKPP-TPTI):PC70BM (1:3 wt%) showed a better interpenetrating network between the donor and the acceptor. This shows that each substituent on the TPT unit affects the photoactive layer morphology differently.

Conclusions
Four new polymers were prepared to study the property modulation of pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-dione-based polymers via the incorporation of electron rich 2,5-di(2-thienyl)pyrrole or weak electron accepting 2,5-di(2-thienyl)pyrrole containing electron withdrawing ester, amide and imide groups on the 3,4-position of pyrrole. The optical and electrochemical studies suggest that the incorporation of electron withdrawing substituents such as ester, amide and imide groups into the polymer backbone induced a blue shift in absorption and lowered their highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels significantly. The organic field effect transistors studies indicated that the polymers containing ester and amide groups on their backbone displayed lower hole mobility than the polymers containing hydrogen and imide groups on their backbone due to the decreased planarity of the unit cell. The overall photovoltaic performance of the polymers incorporating electron withdrawing substituents into the polymer backbone was relatively low than that of the polymer containing hydrogen on the backbone. However, the former polymers resulted in a high open-circuit voltage. Overall, it is concluded that the incorporation of any electron withdrawing groups on the 3,4-position of pyrrole-based polymers increases the open-circuit voltage of the resulting PSCs significantly.
