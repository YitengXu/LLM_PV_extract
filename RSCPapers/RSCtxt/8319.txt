    , Accepted 24th February 2012First published on 12th March 2012AbstractThe synthesis of nano-TiO2 materials have attracted intense interest due to their importance in a wide area of applications. In this study, we report a facile method to synthesize mixed-phase TiO2 nanocomposites by using a one-step approach under mild solvothermal conditions. Differently from previous reports, this method not only yields rutile/brookite/anatase TiO2 nanocomposites with high photocatalytic activities, but also can obtain highly oriented single-crystal rutile nanorod arrays selectively deposited on FTO. These products were characterized by XRD, FTIR, FESEM, TEM, HRTEM, and BET. Results indicate that in the brookite/anatase/rutile coexisting nanopowders, the brookite and anatase phases were crystallized into irregular nanoparticles <20 nm in diameter, whereas the rutile phase was crystallized into single-crystalline nanorods ∼20 nm in diameter and 100 to 500 nm in length. The single-crystalline rutile nanorods could form a film with controllable thickness up to ∼7 μm. The sample with 29.9% anatase, 27.9% brookite, 42.2% rutile was shown to have the highest photocatalytic activity, yielding over 90% bleaching of methyl orange solution in 20 min. The degradation rate constant k of this sample was 0.10180 min−1, almost twice as high as that of P25 (k = 0.05397 min−1). DFT calculations were used to confirm the band structures and density of states in brookite, anatase, and rutile phases.
1. Introduction
Titanium dioxide (TiO2) is a wide band gap semiconductor, which has outstanding chemical stability, high refractive index, great ultraviolet absorptivity, and photochemical activity.1,2 In nature, TiO2 has three most commonly encountered crystalline polymorphs including brookite, anatase, and rutile. All three crystal structures are made up of distorted TiO6 octahedra, but connected in different ways as shown in Fig. 1. Brookite adopts an orthorhombic structure, the octahedra share three edges and also corners, and the dominant structural feature is a chain of edge sharing. Rutile adopts a tetragonal structure, in which two opposing edges of each octahedron are shared to form linear chains along the [001] direction and the TiO6 chains are then linked together via corner connection. Anatase (tetragonal) has no corner sharing but has four edges shared per octahedron.3 All of them are of great interest in various applications including heterogeneous catalysis, photocatalysis, photovoltaic solar cells, gas sensors, waste remediation, batteries, photonic crystals, ultraviolet blockers, smart coatings, and filling materials in textiles, paints, papers, cosmetics, and biomedical sciences.4
 Fig. 1  Representation of three TiO2 polymorphs: anatase, rutile, and brookite forms. 
The three TiO2 polymorphs have been intensively studied in the area of photocatalysis and solar energy conversion, since Fujishima and Honda5 discovered the photocatalytic splitting of water on TiO2 photoanode in 1972, and O'Regan and Grätzel6 reported the pioneering work on the promising applications of mesoporous TiO2 electrodes in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) in 1991. For DSSCs, so far, ∼11% conversion efficiency has been achieved by using TiO2 mesoporous film electrodes,7 but further improvement is still necessary. The major bottleneck for this improvement is the transport of photogenerated electrons across the TiO2 nanoparticle network, which competes with the charge recombination. To suppress the charge recombination and improve the electron transport, several strategies have been reported including (a) using composite semiconductors with different band gaps, (b) using porous structure vertical to the substrate, and (c) introducing 1D nanostructured materials as the charge carriers.8,9 TiO2 polymorphs, brookite, anatase, and rutile, have different band gaps in the sequence of Eg brookite > Eg anatase > Eg rutile, and their composites can be applied in DSSCs with improved performance. For instance, Schmuttenmaer et al.10 reported that the addition of 10–15% rutile significantly improved the light harvesting and the overall solar conversion efficiency of anatase NPs in DSSCs, and they proposed that the interfacial electron transfer from rutile to anatase accounted for the synergistic effect in DSSCs.
As for photocatalysis, TiO2 is still the most promising candidate due to its chemical stability and strong oxidation power of photogenerated holes under ultraviolet (UV) light irradiation. Among the three TiO2 polymorphs, anatase is usually considered to be the most photoactive for the degradation of organic pollutants.11 Since photocatalysis efficiency is largely limited by detrimental electron-hole recombination, coupling two different types of photoactive semiconductor materials has been proved to be an efficient approach for enhancing electron-hole charge separation and inhibiting electron-hole recombination. In particular, the anatase/rutile heterogeneous nanostructure is quite attractive because it involves only one material with a slight change in crystal. Coupling of anatase and rutile allows the transport of electrons excited by ultraviolet light from anatase to rutile due to the slightly lower conduction band energy of the rutile phase, and thus charge recombination can be suppressed.11 This synergistic effect, which exists between anatase and rutile in mixed-phase TiO2 nanocomposite photocatalysts, has been widely reported. For example, Liu et al.12 prepared anatase/rutile nanostructures by the layer-by-layer assembly technique. Cao et al.13 reported the fabrication of rutile TiO2–Sn/anatase TiO2–N heterostructure; Kawahara et al.14 prepared anatase/rutile coupled particles by a dissolution-reprecipitation method; Ohno et al.15 prepared an anatase/rutile mixture by physically mixing anatase and rutile TiO2 particles in water or calcining pure anatase TiO2 powders at different temperature. Even the commercially available Degussa P25, which is the gold standard for photocatalysts because of its superior activity, is also a mixed-phase TiO2 material consisting of 85% anatase and 15% rutile.10 While much of the literature has mainly focused on photocatalytic properties of anatase, rutile, or anatase/rutile mixtures, adequate attention has not been paid to brookite/anatase mixtures, not to mention brookite/anatase/rutile coexisting mixtures. Here, we report on the synthesis and photocatalytic activities of the brookite/anatase/rutile coexisting nanocomposites by using a facile one-step solvothermal approach, during which a highly oriented single-crystal rutile nanorods arrays on transparent substrate can be obtained simultaneously.
The brookite/anatase/rutile coexisting TiO2 nanocomposites were obtained by using toluene as the nonpolar solvent and toluene soluble tetrabutyl titanate as the precursor, concentrated hydrochloric acid was then added to avoid hydrolysis of the precursor by ensuring an acidic solution pH. Morphologies, crystal components, structural and textural properties, and photocatalytic activities of the resulting TiO2 nanocomposites were investigated in detail. Results indicate that the obtained TiO2 nanocomposites consisted of brookite/anatase nanoparticles and rutile nanorods, which exhibited high photocatalytic activity. Moreover, potential applications of the TiO2 nanocomposites in DSSCs are also discussed.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Synthesis
All chemicals used in this work were analytical-grade reagents and used without further purification. In a typical synthesis procedure, 1 mL of Ti (OC4H9)4 tetrabutyl titanate (TBOT, 98%) was mixed with 10 mL toluene under magnetic stirring producing a yellowish solution. Then 1 mL of concentrated hydrochloric acid (HCl, 36.5%–38% by weight) was slowly added into the yellowish solution dropwise. The final mixture was transferred to a Teflon-lined stainless autoclave of 30 mL capacity and was autoclaved at 180 °C for 3 h. After cooling naturally to room temperature, the resulting products were collected and washed with ethanol and water several times and finally dried in air at 70 °C for 8 h. As presented in Table 1, the obtained TiO2 samples with varying volume ratio of toluene to HCl to TBOT were denoted as T1, T2, T3, T4, T5, T6, and T7.

In the control experiment, an extra piece of ultrasonically cleaned fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass substrate was inserted into the reaction system, by placing it at an angle against the wall of the Teflon-liner with the conducting side facing down for 3 h, while the other experiment parameters were unchanged. The FTO substrate was then taken out, rinsed extensively with deionized water, allowed to dry in ambient air, and then characterized in detail.
2.2 Characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the resulting samples were obtained by a D/max-2400 X-ray diffraction spectrometer (Rigaku) with Cu-Kα radiation, operated at 40 kV and 100 mA from 15° to 70° with scanning speed of 15° min−1 and steps of 0.02°. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, JSM-7000F, JEOL Inc., Japan) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM2100, JEOL Inc., Japan) were used to characterize the morphological and structural properties of the TiO2 nanocomposite powders and the sample deposited on the FTO substrate. The TEM was operated under an acceleration voltage of 200 kV. FESEM observation was carried out with an acceleration voltage of 20 kV. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy (model FTS-65, Bio-RAD Laboratories, Tokyo) of the powders was performed by the standard KBr method. The specific surface area of the powders was determined by Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) analysis (model ASAP 2020, Micromeritics, USA) via nitrogen adsorption at 77 K. All the samples were degassed at 150 °C prior to nitrogen adsorption measurements.
2.3 Photocatalytic activity measurement
Methyl orange (MO, C14H14N3NaO3S), a common target known to be carcinogenic and mutagenic, was selected as the probe to evaluate the photocatalytic activity of the resulting TiO2 nanocomposite powders. Suspensions of 0.3 g L−1 photocatalyst were added to MO aqueous solution by ultrasonication followed by magnetic stirring in the dark to ensure adsorption-desorption equilibrium prior to ultraviolet irradiation. Subsequently, the photocatalytic degradation was carried out by stirring the reaction mixture under ultraviolet irradiation using a high-pressure mercury lamp (300 W). A small volume of the dye suspension solution was withdrawn at specific time intervals. After centrifugation, the residual MO aqueous solution was measured by the UV-Vis spectrophotometer (JASCO, V-570) at 465 nm based on the Beer–Lambert Law.16 Additional tests were also carried out in which the TiO2 powder and MO suspension were irradiated by visible light as the comparative test, and the total organic carbon (TOC) obtained by a Shimadzu 500 TOC analyzer.
2.4 Computational details
The band structure of the brookite, anatase, and rutile phases was calculated based on first-principle methods, and all calculations and theoretical analysis were carried out by using the density functional theory (DFT)-based CASTEP software package.17 The Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof parametrization18 of the generalized gradient approximation (GGA)19 was adopted for the exchange–correlation potential. The electron wave function was expanded in plane waves up to a cutoff energy of 300 eV, and Monkhorst–Pack k-point meshes20 of 2 × 4 × 4. In the computing process, all electron potentials were replaced by ultrasoft pseudopotentials. In addition, the SCF tolerance was 2.0–6.0 eV atom−1. The crystal structures used in the modelling processing were shown in Fig. 1.
3. Results and discussion
During fabrication the polar water from the HCl solution formed a water/toluene interface, which keeps the Ti4+ precursors from drastically hydrolyzing with the water. As temperature increases, water molecules diffuse away from the high-energy water/toluene interface, trying to minimize system energy. Simultaneously, the diffusing water molecules react with the Ti4+ in the toluene, resulting in the formation of a crystal nucleus, from which the nanocomposites are formed.
3.1 Crystalline and morphologic properties of the as-prepared TiO2 nanocomposites
XRD results show similar diffraction patterns, indicating that most of the obtained white powders are three-phase mixed TiO2 nanocomposites, which consist of brookite, anatase, and rutile nanocrystals. Fig. 2 shows a typical XRD pattern of the sample T2, which clearly demonstrates the coexistence of three titania polymorphs, namely orthorhombic brookite (JCPDS, file No. 29-1360: a = 5.143 Å, b = 5.456 Å, c = 9.182 Å; space group: D152h), tetragonal anatase (JCPDS, file No. 21-1272: a = b = 3.785 Å, c = 9.514 Å; space group: D194h), and tetragonal rutile (JCPDS, file No. 21-1276: a = b = 4.593 Å, c = 2.959 Å; space group: D144h). The existence of brookite in the nanocomposites is readily discernible from its (121) plane diffraction located at ∼30.8° (2θ) in the XRD pattern, since no overlapping of this peak with any other peaks from anatase or rutile occurs. Rutile phase can be also easily identified from its (110) plane diffraction located at 27.4° (2θ). Although the strongest diffraction from anatase ((101) plane, d = 0.352 nm) is overlapped with the strongest diffraction from brookite ((120) plane, d = 0.351 nm), the relative amount of the three polymorphs can still be evaluated by using the Rietveld refinement method (a whole pattern fitting method), which systematically varies constraints in a simulated pattern to minimize difference from that of the experimental pattern.21 The obtained phase components of different samples are summarized in Table 1. It can be seen that the brookite, anatase, and rutile coexist in all the samples except the sample T7, implying that the brookite/anatase/rutile nanocomposites can be yielded under a wide range of synthesis protocols (which greatly facilitates their manufacture and potential applications). The sample T2 contains 29.9% of anatase, 27.9% of brookite, and 42.2% of rutile phase, and shows the highest photocatalytic activities toward bleaching the MO aqueous solution, and it is therefore selected to be investigated in detail.
 Fig. 2  Typical XRD pattern of the brookite/anatase/rutile TiO2 nanocomposite prepared with one-step solvothermal approach and FESEM image of the sample T2 with brookite/anatase/rutile coexisting structure. 
The inset of Fig. 2 shows the FESEM image of sample T2. It can be seen that this powder consists of two kinds of nanocrystals with different morphologies, namely nanoparticles and nanorods. The sizes of the nanoparticles are found to be quite small in diameter (<100 nm), whereas the nanorods are roughly 20 nm in diameter and several hundred nanometres in length. These nanoparticles and nanorods are loosely aggregated together with random orientations.
The morphology and components of sample T2 were further observed by TEM as shown in Fig. 3. Fig. 3(a) shows a low magnification TEM image of this powder, indicating that it consists of irregular nanoparticles and nanorods, which is consistent with FESEM results. It is also apparent that this powder is well dispersed for TEM imaging as shown in Fig. 3(a). The diameter of the nanoparticles are found to be 8 to 30 nm, while the nanorods are actually composed of the aggregated single nanorods which are each about 20 nm in diameter and 100 to 500 nm in length. Fig. 3(b) shows a close-up TEM image with a high magnification. The two aligned single-nanorods are surrounded by numerous nanocrystals. High resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) was adopted to analyze the crystal properties of these nanoparticles and nanorods as shown in Fig. 3(c), (d), and (e). Results indicate that the nanoparticles are from the brookite and anatase phases and the nanorods are from the rutile phase, which confirms the coexistence of the brookite, anatase, and rutile in the nanocomposites as demonstrated by XRD. Fig. 3(c) is the lattice image of a single brookite nanoparticle, where the d-spacing of 0.342 nm corresponds to the (111) plane of the brookite lattice. The well resolved lattice fringes also imply their excellent crystallinity. In Fig. 3(e), the d-spacing of 0.352 nm corresponds to the (101) plane of the anatase lattice, indicating the existence of the anatase nanocrystals. Fig. 3(d) illustrates the nanorods are in rutile phase, and each individual nanorod is found to have been completely crystallized along its entire length. In the meantime, both d-spacing calculation (d001 = 0.296 nm) from the HRTEM lattice image (Fig. 3(d)) and analysis of the SEAD as an inset of Fig. 3(d) indicate that the rutile nanorods grow along the [001] direction (c-axis). The preferential growth along this direction should arise from the unique crystal structure of the rutile phase. It is known that the rutile phase has 42 screw axes along the crystallographic c-axis. The screw structure will promote the crystal growth along this direction, leading to a crystal morphology dominated by the {110} faces.22 It should be noted here that the chlorine incorporating into the rutile lattice may be also responsible for the formation of the rod-like rutile nanoparticles.23

Interestingly, the rutile nanorods can be selectively deposited on the FTO substrate in the control experiment. As shown in Fig. 4, the rutile nanorods grow perpendicularly on the substrate to form a well oriented nanorod-array film with thickness of ∼2 μm. XRD patterns of the nanorod-arrays film show that the (002) diffraction peak of the rutile phase is significantly enhanced, which not only confirms the single-crystalline nature of the rutile nanorods but also indicates that the nanorods grow in the [001] direction and the as-deposited film is highly oriented with respect to the substrate surface. The rutile structure of FTO layer promotes the rutile TiO2 selectively deposition on its surface, due to the smallest lattice mismatching. The length of the rutile nanorods can reach up to ∼7 μm by increasing the reaction time, as shown in Fig. S1 (†ESI). Such oriented rutile TiO2 nanorod-array films can be applied in DSSCs, making use of their single-crystalline characteristics that offer direct pathways for photogenerated electrons and increase the electron transport rate.24,25

Furthermore, Fig. 5 shows the XRD patterns of all the samples with different reagents ratios (toluene:HCl:TBOT) varying from 10.0:1.0:0.8 to 10.0:1.0:2.0 to 15.0:4.0:2.0. The broadening diffraction peaks imply the nano-crystalline nature of the samples. Apparently, the samples T2 to T6 exhibit a brookite/anatase/rutile coexisting diffraction pattern, while samples T1 and T7 show a rutile dominant diffraction pattern. Based on Table 1, the tendency of each phase with different synthesis protocols is diagrammatically shown in Fig. S2 (†ESI). It can be seen that the components of each individual phase show a terraced distribution, where the rutile phase decreases sharply to a stable region at first and then back its original level (from 85.7% to 15.2% then to 93.2%), while the brookite and anatase phases increase to a stable level at first and then decrease sharply to almost null. These results indicate that to obtain rutile dominant powders, reagent ingredients of “toluene:HCl:TBOT = 10.0:1.0:0.8 or 15.0:4.0:2.0” should be used; to synthesize the brookite/anatase/rutile coexisting powders, the reagent ingredients are suggested to be between “10.0:1.0:0.8 and 10.0:1.0:2.0”.
 Fig. 5  XRD patterns of the TiO2 powders synthesized with various reagent ingredients, where labels T1 to T7 correspond to the sample no. as given in Table 1. 
The morphological differences between the rutile dominant powders (samples T1 and T7) and the brookite/anatase/rutile coexisting powders (samples T2–T6) are further revealed by FESEM as shown in Fig. 6. Fig. 6(a) and (b) show that the anatase/brookite/rutile coexisting powders (sample T2) consist of spherical aggregates of nanoparticles and nanorods with about 3 to 5 μm in diameter. Actually, these spherical aggregates constitute the brookite/anatase nanoparticles and the rutile nanorods, which can be easily disaggregated into the dispersed nanoparticles (see Fig. 3). That is to say, the brookite/anatase/rutile coexisting powders are easily used in practical applications. Fig. 6(c) and (d) show that the rutile dominant powders (sample T7, ∼90% rutile) are composed of hedgehog-like aggregates with 500 nm to 1 μm diameters. However, unlike the former spherical aggregates, these hedgehog-like aggregates are mainly composed of rutile nanorods which essentially grew together during the nucleation and growth processing, and thus they are difficult to disaggregate as shown in Fig. S3 (†ESI). These results imply that the rutile dominant powders may be inappropriate for some applications such as battery, pigment, and photocatalysis.

The typical FTIR spectra taken from the brookite/anatase/rutile coexisting (T2, T3, and T5) and the rutile dominant (T7) samples were shown in Fig. S4 (†ESI), and they exhibit almost identical patterns from 4000 to 500 cm−1, which suggests the existence of hydration water for all the investigated samples, as evidenced by the appearance of absorption bands around 3400 cm−1 and 1636 cm−1.26 It is well-known that the TiO2 superficial hydroxyl group plays an important role in photocatalytic activity.27 The strong absorption observed below 850 cm−1 is due to lattice vibrations of three TiO2 polymorphs.28
3.2 Photocatalytic activity of the brookite/anatase/rutile coexisting TiO2 nanocomposites
Photocatalytic activity of the TiO2 nanocomposites synthesized in the present work was measured via bleaching 20 mg L−1 MO aqueous solution. Fig. 7 shows degradation kinetics of the MO aqueous solution with addition of samples T1–T7, respectively. It can be seen that the tested TiO2 powders show unequal photocatalytic activities towards bleaching the MO solution. Samples T2–T6 can efficiently degrade the MO solution and have higher photocatalytic activities than commercial Degussa P25 (P25) powders. P25 is one of the most widely used among currently available commercial TiO2 photocatalysts, and only a small number of the lab-made TiO2 samples show activity higher than that of P25. 29,30 The relatively poor activities of samples T1 and T7 is probably related to their rutile dominant phase-components (∼90% rutile) and close packed hedgehog-like structures as shown in Fig. 5, 6(c) and 6(d), and S3 (†ESI). Particularly, sample T2 (29.9% anatase, 27.9% brookite, 42.2% rutile) shows the highest photocatalytic activities among all the tested samples, which achieves over 90% degradation of the MO solution in 20 min. The inset of Fig. 7 shows the TOC monitored degradation process of the MO solution by using sample T2 as the photocatalyst. Meanwhile, the comparative test indicates that the MO solution shows little change after irradiation by visible light up to 70 min, see Fig. S5(†ESI). These results suggest that the bleaching/degradation of the MO aqueous solution are actually caused by a photocatalytic reaction on the TiO2 surface.
 Fig. 7  Photocatalytic degradation kinetics of the MO aqueous solution by using the TiO2 powders synthesized with various reagent ingredients, and the inset shows the removal of MO monitored by TOC with the sample T2 as photocatalysts. 
The photocatalytic degradation of the MO aqueous solution can be regarded as a pseudo-first-order reaction,31,32 and thus its kinetics can be expressed as follows: Ct = C0e−kt(1)where k (min−1) is the degradation rate constant and Ct and C0 are the MO concentration at the reaction time t and the initial concentration, respectively. Thus the degradation rate of the tested powders can be calculated from eqn (1) and their k values are listed in Table 1. It can be seen that the sample T2 exhibits the highest k value of 0.10180 min−1, almost twice as high as that of that of P25 (k = 0.05397 min−1), which is helpful for better understanding the best performance of the sample T2 among all the tested samples. For catalysis applications, stability is also very important from a practical viewpoint; to this end, recycle experiments of the photocatalyst were also carried out by using the best photocatalyst sample T2 as shown in Fig. 8. It can be seen that after five recycles, the photocatalytic activity of the sample shows only a slight loss, which is mainly due to the nano-scale nature of the TiO2 nanocomposites.
 Fig. 8  Cycling degradation curves of the brookite/anatase/rutile coexisting nanocomposites (sample T2). 
The photocatalytic activity of a TiO2 powder is a delicate function of many factors, including phase structure, crystallite size, particle shape, impurity type and concentration, specific surface area, surface hydroxylation, and preparation method.3 In order to understand this superior performance better, the textural features of sample T2 are further investigated by the N2 adsorption/desorption and the result is shown in Fig. 9. The isotherm belongs to a type-IV isotherm with a type-H3 hysteresis loop, indicating a mesoporous structure.33 Such organized porous structures might be extremely useful in photocatalysis because they possess efficient transport pathways to reactant and product molecules.29 The relatively narrow pore size distribution mostly in the range of 17–20 nm as shown in the inset of Fig. 9 is calculated by using the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method from the desorption branch of the isotherm. Such a porous structure gives rise to a BET specific surface area of 48.9 m2 g−1 similar to that of P25 (∼50 m2 g−1). Considering that the sample T2 (29.9% anatase, 27.9% brookite, 42.2% rutile) contains more than 40% rutile nanorods aggregates (as shown in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3(a)), the brookite/anatase nanoparticles in sample T2 are believed to have primarily contributed to its high specific surface area. By taking a close-up TEM observation, the diameters of the brookite/anatase nanoparticles in sample T2 are found to be >80% particle ∼10 nm and <20% with ∼20 nm (by counting 46 nanocrystals) as shown in Fig. S6 (a) (†ESI). However, the sizes of the nanocrystals in P25 are generally ∼20 nm as shown in Fig. S6 (b) (†ESI). Smaller crystal sizes of the presented powders are preferable for photocatalytic reaction, due to quantum confinement effects when the sizes of TiO2 nanoparticles decrease to less than 20 nm.34 A smaller crystal size might contribute to the high photocatalytic activity of sample T2. Special attention should also be given to the brookite component in T2, since Ohtani and Österlund et al. reported markedly high photocatalytic activity of brookite nanocrystals compared to those of rutile and anatase.35,36 Therefore, the 27.9% composition of brookite in sample T2 may also contribute to its high photocatalytic activity.
 Fig. 9  N2 adsorption/desorption isotherm of sample T2, the inset shows the pore size distribution calculated using the BJH method from the desorption curve. 
Furthermore, the brookite/anatase/rutile coexisting structure of sample T2 is likely to play an important role in the photocatalytic process, due to well-studied synergetic effects.37,38 As shown in Fig. S7 (†ESI), DFT calculations show that the brookite and rutile have a direct fundamental band gap located at the G point, while the fundamental band gap of anatase is indirect, with valence band maximum (VBM) located near the X point and conduction band maximum (CBM) at the G point in tetragonal Brillouin zone. The calculated band gaps of the brookite, anatase, and rutile are 2.16 eV, 2.14 eV and 1.90 eV, smaller than experimental values of 3.26 eV, 3.2 eV, and 3.0 eV,39,40 respectively, due to the GGA band gap underestimation. Besides their different band gaps, the calculated density of states (DOS) of the three TiO2 polymorphs are also different as shown in Fig. S8 (†ESI). Heterojunctions are thus formed between brookite, anatase, and rutile phase, and thereby the photogenerated electron/hole pairs can be efficiently separated among the three phases due to their different band structure and DOS, this might also be a reason for the superior photocatalytic performance of the sample T2. Considering some other factors demonstrated by FTIR (Fig. S4†), N2 adsorption/desorption (Fig. 9), and XRD (Fig. 5), the high photocatalytic activities of the brookite/anatase/rutile coexisting nanocomposites can be attributed to a common effect of surface hydroxyls, high specific surface area, and the mixed-phase structure.
In addition, the brookite/anatase/rutile nanocomposites in the present work show promise for application in DSSCs. The brookite/anatase nanoparticles with small sizes (d < 20 nm) can act as dye absorbers, while the 1D single-crystalline rutile nanorods can be employed as charge collectors and the pathway for charge transport as schematically shown in Fig. 10. Actually, it has been reported that introduction of 1D nanorods or nanowires into the TiO2 particle network is an effective approach to suppress the charge recombination and improve the charge transport.8 For instance, Kamat et al.41,42 also reported the incorporation of 1D carbon nanotubes and 2D graphenes into TiO2 nanoparticle networks for DSSCs, respectively, and thus a significant enhancement of photoconversion efficiency was achieved due to the improvement of charge collection and transportation induced by carbon nanotubes or graphene. Efforts are under way to explore a potential application of the brookite/anatase/rutile nanocomposites in DSSCs.

4. Conclusions
In summary, the brookite/anatase/rutile coexisting TiO2 nanocomposites have been synthesized by using a one-step approach under mild solvothermal conditions (180 °C, 3h), in which the brookite and anatase phases are crystallized into irregular nanoparticles <20 nm in diameter and the rutile phase is crystallized into single-crystalline nanorods ∼20 nm in diameter and 100 to 500 nm in length. It has also been found that the single-crystalline rutile nanorods can be selectively deposited on an FTO substrate to form a rutile nanorod-array film on the FTO surface with thickness up to ∼7 μm. Sample T2, which is composed of 29.9% anatase, 27.9% brookite, and 42.2% rutile, shows the highest photocatalytic activity towards decoloration of the MO solution and can achieve over 90% degradation for the MO solution in 20 min. The degradation rate constant k of the sample is 0.10180 min−1, almost twice as high as that of that of P25 (k = 0.05397 min−1). Based on the results of XRD, FTIR, BET, HRTEM, and DFT calculation, the high photocatalytic activities of the brookite/anatase/rutile nanocomposites can be attributed to a combination effect of surface hydroxyls, high specific surface area, and the mixed-phase structure. Moreover, the brookite/anatase/rutile nanocomposites in present work may have other potential applications such as in DSSCs.
