    , Accepted 20th April 2020First published on 20th April 2020AbstractPb2Ti2O5.4F1.2 is a new photocatalyst that has recently been reported to function under visible light with suitable stability, albeit with insufficient photocatalytic activity. The present work demonstrates that the photocatalytic activity of Pb2Ti2O5.4F1.2 during visible-light-driven H2 evolution is improved following post-treatment with alkaline chlorides. The photocatalytic activity of the post-treated Pb2Ti2O5.4F1.2 was found to be greatly affected by both the type of alkaline chloride and the treatment temperature. Among the alkaline chlorides examined, a eutectic NaCl–CsCl mixture (35:65 molar ratio) was found to be the most effective. The optimized material, further modified with a Pt cocatalyst using an in situ photodeposition method with a H2PtCl6 precursor, showed approximately 10 times higher activity than that of an untreated analogue. The optimally modified Pb2Ti2O5.4F1.2 was also found to outperform Ru-loaded, Rh-doped SrTiO3, which is one of the most active metal oxide photocatalysts workable under visible light. Transient absorption spectroscopy indicated that the reactivity of photogenerated free and/or shallowly trapped electrons in the Pt-loaded, NaCl–CsCl-treated Pb2Ti2O5.4F1.2 with H2O was higher than that in an analogue not treated with the NaCl–CsCl mixture. Based on various physicochemical analyses, it is evident that the NaCl–CsCl treatment creates ion-exchangeable alkaline-titanate species on the catalyst surface that undergo proton-exchange during the photodeposition of Pt, leading to improved affinity for H2O. This effect explains the high activity of the NaCl–CsCl-treated Pb2Ti2O5.4F1.2 during H2 evolution under visible light.
Introduction
Hydrogen production via photocatalytic water splitting using illuminated semiconductors is an attractive means of solar-to-chemical energy conversion.1–5 The initial step of this reaction is light absorption by a semiconductor, generating electrons and holes in the conduction and valence band of the material, respectively. These photogenerated charge carriers must subsequently migrate from the semiconductor bulk to the surface with minimal probability of recombination, so as to maximize the rates of surface chemical reactions. Therefore, the photocatalytic activity of a semiconductor during water splitting is highly dependent on both bulk and surface properties, and so modifications of both regions are important.
Alkaline metal salts can be used to modify metal oxide photocatalysts so as to improve their activities, because exposure to these salts either during or after the synthesis of metal oxides can alter both the morphological and crystallographic properties of the oxides.6,7 This, in turn, improves the reactivity and lifetimes of photogenerated charge carriers.8–10 Flux methods in which crystalline particles are grown via the dissolution and recrystallization of solutes as a result of supersaturation11 are possible approaches to alkaline metal salt treatments. In some cases, alkaline metal salts (which in principle can serve as the flux) can be used for surface treatment of metal oxides by reducing the amount of the salt in the preparation process. As an example, Kato et al. developed crystal facet-engineered SrTiO3 particles that showed enhanced photocatalytic activity during overall water splitting by using a small amount of alkaline metal salts.12 The synthesis of similar facet-engineered SrTiO3 using a hydrothermal method was reported by Li et al.13 In addition, the photocatalytic water oxidation activity of WO3 has been found to be significantly improved following an alkaline chloride treatment, with the highest activity obtained using CsCl.14,15 In this case, it was proposed that the WO3 particles were covered with a very thin layer of a caesium tungstate species, and that ion-exchangeable sites that promote redox reactions on the WO3 surface were formed by the CsCl treatment. Alkaline metal salt treatments, including flux-based techniques, can be applied not only to metal oxides but also to (oxy)nitrides, and improved photocatalytic activities have been reported as a result.16–19 Recently, flux treatments have additionally been applied to oxychloride photocatalysts.20,21
Oxyfluoride Pb2Ti2O5.4F1.2, which has an anion-ordered A2B2X6X′0.5-type pyrochlore structure,22 has been recently reported to function as a narrow-gap n-type semiconductor photocatalyst with a band gap of approximately 2.4 eV, and is active during water reduction/oxidation and CO2 reduction with the aid of a suitable promoter.23 Different from ordinary mixed-anion compounds such as oxynitrides where less electronegative p orbitals of anion than oxygen constitute the valence band maximum,24 the origin of the visible-light-response of Pb2Ti2O5.4F1.2 is a reinforced orbital interaction between Pb 6s and O 2p orbitals in the material, which lifts up the O 2p valence band and reduces the band gap.23,25 Stable photoelectrochemical overall water splitting has been demonstrated using a modified Pb2Ti2O5.4F1.2 as an anode under simulated sunlight, as a result of the valence band of this material, which is primarily composed of stable O 2p orbitals.26 Because of its intrinsic photocorrosion resistance and its relatively negative, pH-independent conduction band potential (approximately −0.8 V vs. NHE at pH 7), Pb2Ti2O5.4F1.2 is very attractive as a visible light absorbing semiconductor both for photocatalytic and photoelectrochemical applications. However, the performance of this material could still be significantly improved.
In contrast to the presently known photocatalysts, the oxyfluoride Pb2Ti2O5.4F1.2 can only be synthesized under vacuum at present,22 and there are no effective means of applying treatments during or after synthesis. With regard to heterogeneous photocatalysis, it is very important to develop effective means of improving the activity of new classes of photocatalysts such as oxyfluorides, as well as to gain insights into the underlying mechanisms of the associated photocatalytic reactions. Therefore, in the present work, an alkaline chloride treatment was applied to Pb2Ti2O5.4F1.2 for the first time, in an attempt to improve its photocatalytic activity. As a result of this optimization, the photocatalytic activity of Pb2Ti2O5.4F1.2 during H2 evolution under visible light was improved by a factor of approximately 10. The causes of this improved activity are discussed herein on the basis of physicochemical characterizations including photoelectrochemical measurements and transient absorption spectroscopy.
Experimental
Materials and reagents
PbO (99.9%) and TiO2 (99.99%) were purchased from the Rare Metallic Co., Ltd., while KCl (>99.5%), RbCl (>95%), CsCl (>99.9%), I2 (>99.8%) and TiCl4 (>99.0%) were purchased from Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd. LiCl (>99.0%), NaCl (>99.5%), Cs2CO3 (>98.0%), acetonitrile (MeCN; >99.5%), triethanolamine (TEOA; >98.0%), H2PtCl6·6H2O (>98.5%), HNO3 (69–70%), acetone (>99.5%), methanol (>99.8%), NaH2PO4·2H2O (99.0–102.0%) and Na2HPO4·12H2O (>99.0%) were purchased from the Kanto Chemical Co., Inc. PbF2 (99.9%) was purchased from Mitsuwa Pure Chemical. Ethanol (≥99.5%) was purchased from Amakasu Chemical Industries. RuCl3·nH2O (Ru 41.76 wt%) was purchased from Furuya Metal.
Based on a previously reported method,22 Pb2Ti2O5.4F1.2 was synthesized through a solid-state reaction using a mixture of PbO, PbF2 and TiO2 powders. These powders were mixed in a PbO/PbF2/TiO2 molar ratio of 1.4:0.6:2 then heated at 873 K for 12 h in an evacuated Pyrex tube.
For use as references, Cs2Ti5O11 and Cs2Ti6O13 were synthesized by solid state reactions with mixtures of Cs2CO3 and TiO2.27 Cs2Ti5O11 was obtained using a 1.1:5.0 molar mixture of Cs2CO3 and TiO2 heated in air at 1270 K for 20 h. Cs2Ti6O13 was synthesized in a similar manner using a Cs2CO3/TiO2 mixture (molar ratio of 1.1:6.0) with heating at 1070 K for 20 h. In both cases, a 10 mol% excess of Cs2CO3 was added to compensate for volatilization of Cs during calcination. The resulting solids were washed with water to remove residual Cs2CO3 and the production of either single-phase Cs2Ti5O11 or Cs2Ti6O13 was confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD).
Alkaline chloride treatment
Samples of the as-prepared Pb2Ti2O5.4F1.2 was subjected to post-treatments with various alkaline chlorides. In a typical experiment, 250 mg of Pb2Ti2O5.4F1.2 was mixed with a specific amount of alkaline chloride using a mortar and pestle at room temperature under ambient pressure. The mixture was subsequently sealed in a Pyrex tube under vacuum, then heated at 573–773 K for 5 h with a ramp rate of 1 K min−1. After uncontrolled cooling to room temperature, the resulting solid product was washed with water to remove residual alkaline chloride species, and finally dried in an oven at 343 K.
Characterization of materials
XRD patterns were acquired with a Rigaku MiniFlex 600. UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) was performed using a JASCO V-565 spectrophotometer equipped with an integrating sphere. Specific surface area values were determined with a BELSORP MINI II instrument (MicrotracBEL) at liquid nitrogen temperature and calculated based on the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) theory. H2O adsorption isotherms were acquired at 298 K using a BELSORP MAX II (MicrotracBEL) instrument. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were acquired with a JEOL JSM-IT100LA scanning electron microscope. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were obtained using a JEOL JEM-2010F with an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. Surface electronic states were examined by means of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS; ESCA-3400, Shimadzu). The binding energies determined by XPS were corrected by referencing the C 1s peak at 285.0 eV for each sample. The chemical compositions were determined using inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS; Agilent Technologies, 7700x).
Cs K-edge X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) data were acquired using the BL14B2 beamline at the SPring-8 facility (proposal no. 2019B1899). Spectra were acquired in the transmission mode at room temperature with a Si (311) double crystal monochromator together with a pair of Rh-coated mirrors to eliminate higher harmonics. X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectra were analysed using the Athena software package.28
Transient absorption spectroscopy
Transient absorption spectroscopy was carried out using a custom-made spectrometer described in a previous paper.29 Each Pb2Ti2O5.4F1.2 specimen was ground using a mortar and a pestle, then dispersed in a small amount of ethanol. The resulting slurry was deposited on a CaF2 plate at a density of 1.5 mg cm−2 after which the specimen was placed into an infrared (IR) cell in preparation for analysis. The samples were photoexcited using 420 nm pulses from an Nd:YAG laser (Continuum Surelite; duration, 6 ns; power, 5 mJ; repetition rate, 5 Hz) under vacuum. The time resolution of this spectrometer was limited to 1–2 μs by the bandwidth of the amplifier (Stanford Research Systems, SR560, 1 MHz).
Photocatalytic reactions
Photocatalytic H2 evolution reactions were conducted in a Pyrex top-irradiation reaction vessel connected to a closed circulation system under Ar at approximately 298 K. In each trial, 100 mg of the photocatalyst was dispersed in 140 mL of a MeCN–TEOA mixture solution (13:1 v/v) containing 1 mL of water unless otherwise stated because of the hydrophobic nature of the Pb2Ti2O5.4F1.2 surface,23 MeCN was used as the main solvent to ensure appropriate dispersion of the catalyst. Prior to visible light irradiation, Pt was deposited on the Pb2Ti2O5.4F1.2 at 0.5 wt% through in situ photodeposition using H2PtCl6 as a precursor under UV irradiation (λ > 350 nm) for 10 h. UV radiation was generated using a 300 W xenon lamp (Cermax, PE300BF) fitted with a cold mirror (CM-1) with the beam passing through a water filter, applying an output current of 20 A. After the photodeposition and an evaluation of the gas phase in the reaction system, visible light (λ > 420 nm) was imparted to the sample through a cutoff filter (L42) and the evolved gases were analysed by gas chromatography (GC-8A with a thermal conductivity detector and an MS-5A column using Ar as the carrier gas, Shimadzu).
Apparent quantum yields (AQYs) for H2 evolution were determined using the same reaction setup but with a band pass filter. The AQY for each trial was estimated from the equation:AQY (%) = 2R/I × 100,where R and I represent the rate of H2 evolution and the rate at which incident photons are imparted to the sample, respectively. The total number of incident photons was measured using a spectroradiometer (Eko Instruments, LS-100). The light intensities were 15 and 18 mW at 365 and 420 nm, respectively. For the measurement of AQY, 200 mg of a treated Pb2Ti2O5.4F1.2 powder was suspended in 140 mL of reactant solution.
Results and discussion
Photocatalytic activity of the post-treated Pb2Ti2O5.4F1.2
As noted, samples of the as-prepared Pb2Ti2O5.4F1.2 were subjected to post-treatment with various alkaline chlorides. In a typical trial, 250 mg of Pb2Ti2O5.4F1.2 was mixed with 140 mol% of an alkaline chloride (relative to the amount of Pb2Ti2O5.4F1.2) and the mixture was heated at 723 K for 5 h under vacuum. In each case, one sample was heated without any salt while another was heated with the salt. The photocatalytic activities of Pb2Ti2O5.4F1.2 specimens treated with various alkaline chlorides are summarized in Fig. 1A. In all cases, with the exception of LiCl, an increase in activity by a factor of two to nine times was observed. The greatest improvement was obtained following treatment with NaCl. In the case of LiCl, it was not possible to perform a reaction with Pb2Ti2O5.4F1.2 because the latter material was decomposed during the treatment, as discussed below.
 Fig. 1  Photocatalytic activities of Pb2Ti2O5.4F1.2 treated with (A) various alkaline chlorides at 723 K and (B) a NaCl–CsCl mixture at different temperatures. Reaction conditions: catalyst, 100 mg (0.5 wt% Pt photodeposited in situ); MeCN/TEOA mixture (13:1 v/v) 140 mL containing 1 mL water; light source, xenon lamp (300 W) with a cutoff filter (L42). Each activity value has an associated experimental error of ∼15%. 
It was expected that the effect of using a particular alkaline chloride on photocatalytic activity would be determined by the ionic radius of the alkali metal and the melting point of the compound. That is, a lower melting point and smaller cation would increase the reactivity with Pb2Ti2O5.4F1.2. Consequently, we also employed a eutectic NaCl–CsCl mixture (35:65 molar ratio) to lower the melting point of the alkaline chloride to 759 K at ambient pressure.30 It was anticipated that the application of reduced pressure would further lower this melting point.
Post-treatment of Pb2Ti2O5.4F1.2 with the NaCl–CsCl mixture (400 mol% relative to the amount of Pb2Ti2O5.4F1.2) was conducted at different temperatures and the photocatalytic activities of the treated materials were investigated. As shown in Fig. 1B, increasing the treatment temperature resulted in a sharp increase in activity up to 723 K, beyond which the activity decreased. At the optimal temperature, the activity was comparable to or a little higher than that achieved using only NaCl at 723 K. It should be noted that the use of NaCl–CsCl at proportions in excess of 400 mol% did not improve the photocatalytic activity, while lower proportions of NaCl–CsCl were also less effective (see Fig. S1†). Overall, these data establish that the alkaline chloride treatment improved the photocatalytic activity of Pb2Ti2O5.4F1.2 during visible-light-driven H2 evolution. In particular, the use of NaCl or a NaCl–CsCl mixture at a suitable temperature (in this case, 723 K) led to drastic improvements in activity, by a factor of close to 10.

Fig. 2 demonstrates that Pb2Ti2O5.4F1.2 subjected to the optimal treatment performed in a stable manner to produce H2 in response to visible light, similar to previously reported results obtained with untreated Pb2Ti2O5.4F1.2.23 In addition, no noticeable changes in the XRD patterns could be identified before and after the H2 evolution reaction (Fig. S2†). Increasing the loading amount of Pt was also found to enhance the H2 evolution rate over Pt/Pb2Ti2O5.4F1.2, but an excess loading resulted in a decrease in activity (Fig. S3†). The rate of H2 evolution over the optimal Pt/Pb2Ti2O5.4F1.2 was higher than that recorded with Ru/SrTiO3:Rh, which is one of the most active metal oxide photocatalysts for visible-light H2 evolution.31–33 The AQY values for H2 evolution using the optimized Pt/Pb2Ti2O5.4F1.2 were determined to be 0.83 and 0.26% at 365 and 420 nm, respectively, roughly 80 times higher than that reported in the previous work,23 although the absolute activity was still not very high. It was also found that Pt-loading was indispensable to obtaining a sufficient level of H2; even under UV irradiation (λ > 350 nm), the H2 evolution rates over unloaded Pb2Ti2O5.4F1.2 were slower than 0.1 μmol h−1, regardless of alkaline chloride treatment.

Reaction conditions: catalyst, 100 mg (0.5 wt% Pt photodeposited); MeCN/TEOA mixture (13:1 v/v) 140 mL containing 1 mL water; light source, xenon lamp (300 W) with a cutoff filter (L42). Data obtained using an untreated specimen is also shown. 
Structural properties of the post-treated Pb2Ti2O5.4F1.2
In order to correlate the photocatalytic activities of the treated Pb2Ti2O5.4F1.2 with physicochemical properties, structural analyses of the post-treated Pb2Ti2O5.4F1.2 were performed using XRD, UV-visible DRS, XPS, XAFS, SEM and TEM. Fig. 3A provides the XRD patterns for Pb2Ti2O5.4F1.2 treated with various alkaline chlorides at 723 K for 5 h. With the exception of the material treated with LiCl, the XRD pattern for the original Pb2Ti2O5.4F1.2 remained unchanged, with no shifts in the diffraction peak positions and no changes in the full width at half maximum (FWHM) values. This result strongly suggests that, other than when using LiCl, the alkaline chloride treatments did not damage the crystal structure of the Pb2Ti2O5.4F1.2, and that the incorporation of A+/Cl− ions (A = alkaline metal) into the Pb2Ti2O5.4F1.2 lattice, if any, was negligible.
 Fig. 3  The XRD patterns of Pb2Ti2O5.4F1.2 treated with (A) various alkaline chlorides at 723 K and (B) a NaCl–CsCl (35:65) mixture at different temperatures. 
When using the eutectic NaCl–CsCl mixture, no change in the XRD pattern could be identified up to 723 K (Fig. 3B), as was also observed when using only NaCl or CsCl. However, raising the temperature to 773 K generated a small amount of a PbTiO3 phase. A previous study found that Pb2Ti2O5.4F1.2 underwent a transformation to perovskite PbTiO3 by releasing F2 above 873 K in ambient air.22 Because the NaCl–CsCl treatment was performed under vacuum in the present work, this decomposition reaction would be expected to occur at temperatures lower than 873 K. This decomposition would be accompanied by the release of F2 from the Pb2Ti2O5.4F1.2 surface, which was confirmed by the XPS analysis. As shown in Table 1, the surface F/Ti atomic ratio was almost constant over the range of 573–723 K but was significantly decreased at 773 K.

Fig. 4 shows the Pb 4f, Ti 2p, O 1s and F 1s XPS data obtained from Pb2Ti2O5.4F1.2 treated with the eutectic NaCl–CsCl mixture (at 400 mol%) at different temperatures. Na 1s, Cs 3d and Cl 2p results are also provided to assess the possible incorporation of the alkaline salts on the Pb2Ti2O5.4F1.2 surface. No significant changes in the Pb 4f, O 1s and F 1s binding energies are evident. However, the Ti 2p binding energies in the samples treated at 673 and 723 K were shifted to lower energy values, indicating that the Ti species in Pb2Ti2O5.4F1.2 became electron-rich upon treatment. Another noticeable feature in these high-activity specimens is that Na 1s, Cs 3d and Cl 2p signals can been seen, despite the fact that the treated samples were all washed with water. The Cs 3d signal is especially strong, suggesting that water-insoluble Cs species, which must be different from CsCl, were formed on the Pb2Ti2O5.4F1.2 surface. Examining the XPS peak areas confirms that the concentration of Cs species was increased with increases in treatment temperature up to 723 K (Table 1). This result suggests that interactions between the Pb2Ti2O5.4F1.2 and the Cs species in the eutectic mixture were stronger in the range of 673–723 K, such that larger amounts of water-insoluble Cs species were formed on the surface. Argon etching of the specimen exhibiting the highest activity established that the Na, Cs and Cl species were present almost exclusively on the surface (Fig. S4†). These surface Cs and/or Na species could have caused the shift of the Ti 2p signals to lower binding energies, as these are electropositive elements. The apparent decrease in the Cs concentration on going from 723 to 773 K can likely be attributed to the volatilization of CsCl above its melting point under the reduced pressure conditions.
 Fig. 4  Pb 4f, Ti 2p, O 1s and F 1s XPS data for Pb2Ti2O5.4F1.2 treated with NaCl–CsCl (400 mol%) at different temperatures. Na 1s, Cs 3d and Cl 2p spectra are also shown. 
XPS analyses of Pb2Ti2O5.4F1.2 treated with either NaCl or CsCl at 723 K were also performed. As shown in Fig. S5,† Na 1s and Cs 3d signals were generated by the specimens treated with NaCl and CsCl, respectively. However, no peak shifts were observed in the corresponding Pb 4f and Ti 2p spectra. Considering that the samples treated with NaCl at 723 K exhibited activity comparable to that treated with NaCl–CsCl (Fig. 1), these peak shifts are not thought to be related to enhanced activity. Nevertheless, the presence of Na and/or Cs species on the Pb2Ti2O5.4F1.2 surface may have had an effect. ICP-MS analyses established that 0.2 mol% (0.04 wt%) Cs was incorporated in the optimized photocatalyst, while Na species were undetectable due to their low concentrations.
The local structure of the Cs species on the Pb2Ti2O5.4F1.2 surface was also investigated by means of XAFS. As shown in Fig. 5, the XANES spectrum of the NaCl–CsCl-treated Pb2Ti2O5.4F1.2 is dissimilar to that of the CsCl reference but similar to that of Cs2Ti6O13. This result suggests the generation of Cs2Ti6O13-like species on the Pb2Ti2O5.4F1.2 after the NaCl–CsCl treatment at 723 K. Although we could not elucidate the local structure of the Na species in the treated Pb2Ti2O5.4F1.2 due to the low concentration of Na, similar sodium titanates might possibly have been formed.

Electron microscopy observations

Fig. 6A presents SEM images of Pb2Ti2O5.4F1.2 treated with the NaCl–CsCl mixture (400 mol%), NaCl or CsCl at the same temperature of 723 K. Prior to the alkaline chloride treatment, the material had a rough surface structure with numerous irregularly-shaped particles. In each case, surface smoothing occurred following the treatment, generating larger particles. This suggests that the Pb2Ti2O5.4F1.2 underwent recrystallization during the treatment. Surface smoothing was also observed in the case of Pb2Ti2O5.4F1.2 treated with the NaCl–CsCl mixture at lower temperatures, as shown in Fig. 6B. In contrast, surface roughening took place at higher temperatures, likely due to the partial decomposition of the Pb2Ti2O5.4F1.2, as indicated by the XRD and XPS analyses (Fig. 3 and Table 1). Thus, a smoothed surface was observable not only for the high-activity specimens but also the other samples (for example, that treated with CsCl). Specific surface areas were determined by nitrogen adsorption at 77 K and were found to be approximately 1 m2 g−1 for each specimen, regardless of post-treatment. In addition, there were no significant variations in the UV-visible DRS data among these materials (Fig. S6†).

The surface structure of Pb2Ti2O5.4F1.2 treated with NaCl–CsCl at 723 K, which showed the highest activity, was further investigated by TEM observations. As demonstrated in Fig. S7,† high-resolution TEM observations showed the presence of crystalline nanoparticles approximately 5 nm in size on the Pb2Ti2O5.4F1.2 surface before treatment. These images show clear lattice fringes separated by approximately 2.9 Å, which corresponds to the d spacing of the (200) planes in PbF2, and so the crystalline nanoparticles were evidently composed of this compound. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) indicated that these nanoparticles contained only a small amount of titanium species (Fig. S8†). After the NaCl–CsCl treatment, the PbF2 nanoparticles disappeared, presumably as a result of a surface reconstruction effect during the treatment. It was also difficult to identify any Cs- or Na-containing phases in the specimens after treatment.
To investigate whether the improved photocatalytic activity was simply due to the removal of PbF2, the Pb2Ti2O5.4F1.2 was washed with dilute HNO3 before the alkaline chloride treatment. Prior to washing treatment for Pb2Ti2O5.4F1.2, it was confirmed that PbF2 (even bulk particles) dissolved in dilute HNO3 (0.09 M). After washing with dilute HNO3, the photocatalytic activity of the Pb2Ti2O5.4F1.2 was improved by a factor of 3, although it still did not match the performance of the NaCl–CsCl-treated specimen (see Table S1†). Interestingly, treatment of the HNO3-washed Pb2Ti2O5.4F1.2 with NaCl–CsCl lowered the activity by 50%. In addition, washing the NaCl–CsCl-treated Pb2Ti2O5.4F1.2 with HNO3 did not improve its photocatalytic activity. These results indicate that the NaCl–CsCl treatment is critically important to improving the photocatalytic activity of Pb2Ti2O5.4F1.2, although the removal of pre-existing PbF2 nanoparticles with HNO3 also has a positive effect on activity. Based on these results, it is likely that morphological smoothing (as well as possible recrystallization) of the Pb2Ti2O5.4F1.2 during the alkaline chloride treatment is not the primary reason for the improved activity. This phenomenon is clearly different from the behavior of known inorganic photocatalysts such as metal oxides.9,10,12,13
Transient absorption spectroscopy
The effect of the NaCl–CsCl treatment on the Pb2Ti2O5.4F1.2 was further investigated by means of transient absorption spectroscopy, which can assess photogenerated charge carriers in a semiconductor material in the presence of reactant molecules such as H2O.29,34 This technique also enables visualization of the charge transfer process from a semiconductor to a loaded cocatalyst.16,29,35–37

Fig. 7 shows the transient absorption spectra acquired from Pb2Ti2O5.4F1.2 with and without the NaCl–CsCl treatment, based on irradiation with 420 nm light pulses under vacuum. Upon band gap photoexcitation of the Pb2Ti2O5.4F1.2, two characteristic absorption bands appeared at approximately 2000 and 21000 cm−1, which can be assigned to photogenerated free (and/or shallowly trapped) electrons29,38 and trapped holes,39 respectively. It should be noted that the shapes of the transient absorption spectra are almost identical regardless of the NaCl–CsCl treatment, indicating that the treatment itself did not alter the distribution of trap states in the band gap structure of the Pb2Ti2O5.4F1.2.

The decay kinetics of photogenerated free and/or shallowly trapped electrons in the Pb2Ti2O5.4F1.2 specimens were examined by recording the time courses of transient absorption intensity at 2000 cm−1. As demonstrated in Fig. 8, the NaCl–CsCl treated specimen showed a slightly accelerated decay, as compared to the untreated one. In contrast, Pt loading resulted in a more pronounced decay in both specimens. This is a clear indication that photogenerated electrons in the Pb2Ti2O5.4F1.2 specimens were effectively trapped by the loaded Pt nanoparticles, consistent with a previous report.29,35 However, again, there were no significant differences between the two specimens. These results confirm that the lifetimes of photogenerated electrons and the transfer efficiencies of electrons to the Pt cocatalyst were similar in the two specimens.

Interestingly, the photogenerated electron signal produced by the Pt/Pb2Ti2O5.4F1.2 with the NaCl–CsCl treatment decayed more rapidly than that of the untreated analogue in the presence of H2O vapor, as shown in Fig. 9. More concretely, the ratio of ΔAbs(H2O/N2) recorded at 20 μs for the NaCl–CsCl treated specimen was 0.65, which was smaller than that for the untreated one (0.72). It indicates that the NaCl–CsCl-treated specimen contained photogenerated electrons, which were more reactive with H2O as compared to the untreated specimen. This is in qualitative agreement with the enhanced photocatalytic activity of the NaCl–CsCl-treated specimen during H2 evolution. However, even in the presence of H2O, no changes were observed in the specimens without Pt with and without the NaCl–CsCl treatment (Fig. S9†). This result suggests that the increased reactivity of the Pb2Ti2O5.4F1.2 surface with H2O occurred after the photodeposition of Pt.

Transient absorption spectroscopy also showed that the signal intensity arising from trapped holes in the NaCl–CsCl-treated specimen decayed more slowly than that of the untreated analogue (Fig. S10†). This indicates lower activity of the NaCl–CsCl-treated specimen during water oxidation, which was also supported by the photoelectrochemical analysis (see Fig. S11† and additional discussion).
Reasons for the improved activity
The results of the photocatalytic reaction trials and physicochemical analyses indicated that the key to obtaining high activity was to react alkaline chloride with the Pb2Ti2O5.4F1.2 surface while suppressing the decomposition of the Pb2Ti2O5.4F1.2 bulk. To do so, it was desirable to perform the alkaline chloride treatment at higher temperatures, but not as high as the decomposition temperature of Pb2Ti2O5.4F1.2 (>723 K), in conjunction with the use of a reactive alkaline chloride (e.g., a eutectic NaCl–CsCl mixture or NaCl). Treatment at higher temperatures increased the reactivity of the alkaline chlorides with the Pb2Ti2O5.4F1.2 (see Fig. 3 and Table 1), thereby producing a more active photocatalyst.
More specifically, the melting point of the eutectic NaCl–CsCl mixture (759 K) was lower than those of the NaCl (1074 K) and CsCl (918 K). When the Pb2Ti2O5.4F1.2 was treated with these alkaline chlorides at 723 K under vacuum, the eutectic NaCl–CsCl mixture exhibited the highest reactivity with the Pb2Ti2O5.4F1.2 surface. This was confirmed by the XPS analysis (Table 1), which demonstrated that the concentration of residual (i.e., water-insoluble) Na/Cs species was the highest following the NaCl–CsCl treatment. The XANES analysis clearly showed the presence of Cs2Ti6O13-like species on the surface of the Pb2Ti2O5.4F1.2 after the optimal treatment (Fig. 5); the presence of a small amount of sodium titanate species might be suggested as well. In contrast, treatment with CsCl, which has a larger cation, resulted in a smaller amount of residual Cs species on the Pb2Ti2O5.4F1.2 surface. Thus it is clear that the treated Pb2Ti2O5.4F1.2 specimens containing higher concentrations of alkaline residue tended to show higher activity (Table 1), suggesting that alkaline titanates on the Pb2Ti2O5.4F1.2 surface region played an important role in enhancing photocatalytic activity. While the alkaline chloride treatment of Pb2Ti2O5.4F1.2 produced smooth surface structures that are typically thought to enhance photocatalytic reactions, this was not the decisive factor with regard to the enhanced activity of the Pb2Ti2O5.4F1.2. Smooth surface structures were observed even in those samples that showed moderate activities (e.g., the specimen treated with CsCl, see Fig. 6).
It should be noted that HNO3 washing of the as-prepared Pb2Ti2O5.4F1.2 also improved activity (Table S1†). However, treatment of the HNO3-washed Pb2Ti2O5.4F1.2 with NaCl–CsCl lowered the activity by 50%. In addition, washing the NaCl–CsCl-treated Pb2Ti2O5.4F1.2 with HNO3 did not improve photocatalytic activity. These results indicate that the NaCl–CsCl treatment (i.e., the installation of alkaline titanate species on the Pb2Ti2O5.4F1.2 surface) itself is critically important to improving the photocatalytic activity of Pb2Ti2O5.4F1.2, while the HNO3 treatment is a secondary factor.
As discussed in the Introduction, the photocatalytic water oxidation activity of WO3 has been reported to be significantly improved upon CsCl treatment.14,15 In this case, it has been reported that the WO3 particles were covered with a very thin layer of caesium tungstate species after the treatment. This layer exhibits ion-exchange characteristics and provides new active sites that promote redox reactions. In the case of the present Pb2Ti2O5.4F1.2 photocatalyst, XPS analysis showed that the Na/Cs species on the post-treated Pb2Ti2O5.4F1.2 surface disappeared after the in situ photodeposition of Pt (Fig. S12†). This was most likely due to proton-exchange of the Na/Cs species during the photodeposition process, as has been observed in the case of a CsCl-treated WO3 photocatalyst.14 During the photodeposition of Pt on an illuminated semiconductor surface using H2PtCl6 as the precursor, HCl is generated as the photodeposition progresses. It is probable that this HCl acts as the proton source for the ion-exchange reaction, although the H2PtCl6 precursor may also simply donate protons prior to the photodeposition of Pt. Support for the ion-exchange characteristics of the NaCl–CsCl-treated Pb2Ti2O5.4F1.2 having alkaline titanate species on its surface is also provided by reports that Cs2Ti6O13 as well as certain sodium titanates will undergo ion-exchange.40–42 Thus, it was concluded that the improved activity was associated with the existence of surface alkaline titanate species that could undergo proton-exchange.
Photoelectrochemical measurements (Fig. S11†) indicated that the alkaline chloride treatment lowered the efficiency of photooxidation reactions on the Pb2Ti2O5.4F1.2 surface. Nevertheless, the fact that the photocatalytic activity of the Pb2Ti2O5.4F1.2 during H2 evolution was markedly improved upon the same treatment (Fig. 1) strongly suggests that the treatment had a positive effect on photoreduction processes while concealing the negative impact on photooxidation.
It is known that the physicochemical state of the Pt cocatalyst has a significant impact on the H2 evolution activity of a semiconductor photocatalyst.43–46 However, no significant changes could be identified in the physicochemical state of the loaded Pt cocatalyst between the treated and untreated Pb2Ti2O5.4F1.2 based on XPS analyses and TEM observations (Fig. S13 and S14†). In contrast, a clear difference was evident in the time dependent decay profiles of photogenerated electrons in the presence of H2O. As shown in Fig. 9, the NaCl–CsCl-treated Pb2Ti2O5.4F1.2 with photodeposited Pt, on which surface Na/Cs species had been exchanged for protons, exhibited higher reactivity with H2O than an analogue without the NaCl–CsCl treatment. The protonated surface of this material would be expected to provide strong adsorption sites for water as H3O+.14 This effect, in turn, would enhance the activity of the treated Pb2Ti2O5.4F1.2 during visible-light-driven H2 evolution. A proposed mechanism by which the Pb2Ti2O5.4F1.2 photocatalyst can be activated is schematically illustrated in Fig. 10.

The improved hydrophilicity of the Pt-loaded, NaCl–CsCl-treated Pb2Ti2O5.4F1.2 was indicated by H2O adsorption isotherms. As shown in Fig. 11, the amount of adsorbed H2O on the NaCl–CsCl-treated specimen was greater than that on the untreated one. These results are reasonable considering the result of XPS measurement (Fig. S15†), which indicated the population of hydrophilic species (i.e., adsorbed H2O and surface OH groups) on the Pt-loaded, NaCl–CsCl-treated Pb2Ti2O5.4F1.2 surface was larger than that on the untreated analogue. It is also noted that the HNO3 treatment did not increase the population of the hydrophilic species on Pb2Ti2O5.4F1.2, meaning that the presence of alkaline titanate layers formed by the NaCl–CsCl treatment was essential to boosting the photocatalytic H2 evolution activity of Pb2Ti2O5.4F1.2.

Conclusions
The post-treatment of Pb2Ti2O5.4F1.2 with alkaline chlorides was assessed as a means of improving the photocatalytic activity of this material during visible-light-driven H2 evolution. Among the alkaline chlorides examined, a eutectic NaCl–CsCl mixture (35:65 molar ratio) was found to be the best modifier. Physicochemical analyses indicated that the NaCl–CsCl treatment of Pb2Ti2O5.4F1.2 at 723 K under vacuum produced alkaline titanate species on the Pb2Ti2O5.4F1.2 surface that were exchangeable with protons. The in situ photodeposition of a Pt cocatalyst on the Pb2Ti2O5.4F1.2 treated in this manner not only produced active sites for H2 evolution but also promoted ion-exchange of the surface Na/Cs species with protons. Transient absorption spectroscopy revealed that the photogenerated electrons in the Pb2Ti2O5.4F1.2 activated in this manner had a higher degree of reactivity with H2O as compared to Pb2Ti2O5.4F1.2 modified only with Pt (without the NaCl–CsCl treatment). As a result, the Pb2Ti2O5.4F1.2 showed improved photocatalytic activity during H2 evolution. Because Pb2Ti2O5.4F1.2 is hydrophobic,23 the installation of a hydrophilic component on the surface is essential to improving the water reduction activity of the photocatalyst. Our preliminary experiments also demonstrated that the same NaCl–CsCl treatment was effective in improving the performance of another stable oxyfluoride photocatalyst (Pb2Ti4O9F2) during H2 evolution25 (see Fig. S16 and S17†). In this case, the activity was improved by a factor of 15 after the treatment.
Alkaline metal salt treatments of ordinary semiconductor photocatalysts such as metal oxides usually result in a drastic change in the morphology of the material7,12 and also increase the population of free (and/or shallowly trapped) electrons.9 However, these phenomena did not occur in the case of the oxyfluoride Pb2Ti2O5.4F1.2. This work demonstrates that the unique surface properties of Pb2Ti2O5.4F1.2 result in improved photocatalysis, which has not been reported previously for any known photocatalysts. Therefore, we believe that the present findings represent a new strategy for activating oxyfluoride photocatalysts with applications to H2 evolution.
