Introduction
The rapid consumption of fossil fuel has caused unacceptable environmental problems such as green house effects, which would lead to disastrous climatic consequences.1 Now renewable and clean energy resources are definitely required in order to solve such global energy and environmental issues.1 Nature harnesses solar energy for its production by photosynthesis and fossil fuel is the product of photosynthesis. Thus, it is highly desirable to develop artificial photosynthetic systems for the production of hydrogen or other fuels, which are hopefully more efficient than natural systems by exploiting and applying the basic chemistry of photosynthesis.
The electron-transfer systems of photosynthesis have been well understood by the Marcus theory of electron transfer.2 According to the Marcus theory of electron transfer,2 the rate constant of nonadiabatic intramolecular electron transfer (kET) is given by eqn (1), where V is the electronic coupling matrix element, h is the Planck constant, (1)T is the absolute temperature, ΔGET is the free energy change of electron transfer, and λ is the reorganization energy of electron transfer. The most important aspect of the Marcus theory of electron transfer is that the electron-transfer (ET) rate is expected to decrease rather than to increase as the driving force of electron transfer (−ΔGET) increases in the region where the driving force is larger than the reorganization energy of electron transfer (−ΔGET > λ).2 This region (−ΔGET > λ) is generally referred to as the Marcus inverted region. In the normal region (−ΔGET < λ), the ET rate increases with increasing the driving force of electron transfer. The reorganization energy of electron transfer (λ) is the energy required to structurally reorganize the donor, acceptor and their solvation spheres upon electron transfer. Without the Marcus inverted region, there would be no way to enable the efficient charge separation in the photosynthesis, because the back electron transfer to the ground state, which has a large driving force of electron transfer, would be the fastest process to waste the solar energy as heat.
The specific objective of this review is to describe recent development of rational design of bioinspired artificial photosynthetic systems based on the Marcus theory of electron transfer and their applications.3
First, multi-step ET systems composed of electron donor–acceptor ensembles are described, mimicking functions of the photosynthetic reaction center.3 However, a significant amount of energy is lost during the multi-step ET processes. Then, as an alternative to conventional charge-separation functional molecular models based on multi-step long-range ET within redox cascades, simple electron donor–acceptor dyads have been designed and synthesized to attain a long-lived and high-energy charge-separated state without significant loss of excitation energy in light of the Marcus theory of electron transfer.3–5 Such simple molecular dyads, capable of fast charge separation but extremely slow charge recombination, have significant advantages with regard to synthetic feasibility, providing a variety of applications including construction of organic solar cells and development of efficient photocatalytic systems for the solar energy conversion.3–5
Mimicry of multi-step electron transfer in photosynthetic reaction center
A number of multi-step ET processes have so far been developed to attain a long distance charge separation, mimicking the natural photosynthetic reaction center.6–13 The most successful example is given as a series of porphyrin–fullerene linked molecules starting from a zinc porphyrin-C60 dyad (ZnP-C60), a ferrocene-zinc porphpyrin-C60 triad (Fc-ZnP-C60), a zinc porphyrin-free base porphyrin-C60 triad, up to a tetrad (Fc-ZnP-H2P-C60) shown in Fig. 1.14–16 The driving force dependence of the ET rate constants (kET) of these dyad, triads and tetrad molecules for the charge-separation (CS) and charge-recombination (CR) processes in benzonitrile (PhCN) is also shown in Fig. 1, where log kET is plotted against the driving force (−ΔGET).16 The driving force dependence of log kET is well fitted by eqn (1) using the λ and V values for the dyad (ZnP-C60: λ = 0.66 eV, V = 3.9 cm−1), the triad (Fc-ZnP-C60, Fc-H2P-C60, and ZnP-H2P-C60: λ = 1.09 eV, V = 0.019 cm−1) and the tetrad (Fc-ZnP-H2P-C60: λ = 1.32 eV, V = 0.00017 cm−1).16 It should be noted that the λ value increases, whereas the V value decreases with increasing the edge-to-edge distance in the order of the dyad (Ree = 11.9 Å), the triad (Ree = 30.3 Å) and the tetrad (Ree = 48.9 Å). Such an increase in the λ value with increasing the distance results from an increase in the solvent reorganization energy (λs), because the λs value is known to increase with increasing distance between an electron donor and an acceptor as given by eqn (2), λs = e2 (1/2r1 + 1/2r2 − 1/2r12)(1/n2 + 1/ε)(2)where r1 and r2 are the radii of the donor and acceptor, r12 is the donor–acceptor distance, ε is the dielectric constant, and n is the refractive index.17,18
 Fig. 1  Driving force (−ΔGET) dependence of intramolecular ET rate constants (kET) in ZnP-C60 (CS: white circles; CR: white squares), Fc-ZnP-C60 (black circles), Fc-H2P-C60 (black triangles), ZnP-H2P-C60 (black squares), and Fc-ZnP-H2P-C60 (white triangles).16 
In the case of the dyad, the CR rate in ZnP˙+-C60˙− in the Marcus inverted region is much slower than the CS rate constants from both the singlet and triplet excited states in the Marcus normal region (Fig. 1). This makes it possible to undergo a subsequent electron transfer from Fc to ZnP˙+ in the triad (Fc-ZnP˙+-C60˙−) and also from ZnP to H2P˙+ in the triad (ZnP-H2P˙+-C60˙−) to produce the final CS state, Fc+-ZnP-C60˙− and ZnP˙+-H2P-C60˙−, in competition with the back electron transfer (CR process) in the initial CS states. In the case of the tetrad (Fc-ZnP-H2P-C60), one more ET step occurs from Fc to ZnP˙+ to afford the final CS state, Fc+-ZnP-H2P-C60˙−, in which charges are separated at a long distance (Ree = 48.9 Å).16 The lifetime of the resulting CS state at such a long distance in a frozen PhCN becomes as long as 0.38 s because of the extremely small V value (0.00017 cm−1).16 This is the first example to achieve a CS lifetime which is comparable to that observed for the bacterial photosynthetic reaction center. Since then similar tetrad and pentad systems were reported to attain long-lived CS states up to 1.7 s.19–22
It should be noted, however, such an extremely long CS lifetime could only be attained in frozen media, since in condensed media bimolecular back electron transfer between two CS states is much faster than the unimolecular CR process.16
Simple electron donor–acceptor dyads with long CS lifetimes
A significant amount of energy is lost during the multi-step ET processes to reach the final CS state in both natural and artificial photosynthetic reaction centers. In addition, the difficulty to synthesize tetrad or pentad molecules that undergo photoinduced multi-step ET processes (vide supra) has precluded any practical application for construction of photocatalytic energy-conversion systems. Thus, it is highly desirable to design and synthesize simple molecular electron donor–acceptor dyads, which are capable of fast charge separation but retain long CS lifetimes without the energy loss. Theoretically it is possible to obtain such electron donor–acceptor dyads, because the CS lifetime increases with decreasing the λ value in the Marcus inverted region as predicted by eqn (1).2 Since the λs value is expected to increase with increasing the donor–acceptor distance [eqn (2)],17 a number of simple donor–acceptor dyads have been designed and synthesized to attain long-lived CS states, where the donor and acceptor molecules are linked with a short spacer to minimize the solvent reorganization energy.23–32 This strategy to attain long lived CS states in simple donor–acceptor dyads is totally opposite to that for the multi-step ET systems in which the donor–acceptor distance of the final CS state is designed to be as long as possible.16,19–22 A closely linked zinc chlorine–fullerene dyad indeed affords the longer CS lifetime as compared with other zinc chlorine–fullerene dyads with the longer spacers.31
The CS lifetime is expected to increase further with increasing the CS energy in the Marcus inverted region [eqn. (1)].2 However, the CS energy should be lower than the triplet excited state of one of the components of donor–acceptor dyads. Otherwise, the CS state would decay rapidly to the triplet excited state in the Marcus normal region rather than to the ground state in the Marcus inverted region.26,33,34 As long as porphyrin and fullerene derivatives are employed as components of electron donor–acceptor dyads, however, it is impossible to attain the long lived CS states with a high energy because of the low lying triplet-excited states of porphyrin and fullerene derivatives. Thus, it is required to employ a chromophore that has a small ET reorganization energy as well as a high lying triplet excited state.

Acridinium ion is regarded as the best candidate for such a purpose, since the λ value for the electron self-exchange between the acridinium ion and the corresponding one-electron reduced radical is the smallest (0.3 eV) among the redox active organic compounds,35 and the triplet excited energy is significantly higher than those of porphyrins and C60.36 Thus, we have synthesized an electron donor–acceptor dyad, 9-mesityl-10-methylacridinium ion (Acr+–Mes), in which an electron donor moiety (mesityl group) is directly connected at the 9-position of the acridinium ion.36 The X-ray crystal structure of Acr+–Mes (Fig. 2a) indicates that the dihedral angle made by aromatic ring planes is perpendicular and that there is no orbital interaction between the donor and acceptor moieties.36 The HOMO and LUMO orbitals of Acr+–Mes calculated by a DFT method with Gaussian 98 (B3LYP/6-31G* basis set) are localized on mesitylene and acridinium moieties, respectively.36

The photoexcitation of Acr+–Mes results in efficient electron transfer from the Mes moiety to the singlet excited state of the Acr+ moiety to produce the ET state (Acr˙–Mes˙+) with the ET rate constant of 2.4 × 1011 s−1.36 The rate constant of back electron transfer (kBET) is highly temperature dependent (Fig. 3a).36 When the photoirradiation was performed at low temperatures (213–243 K), the color of the sample was clearly changed from green to brownish as shown in the inset of Fig. 3b.37 The resulting solution measured at 77 K affords the absorption spectrum due to the ET state, which consists of the absorption bands of the Acr˙ moiety (500 nm) and the Mes˙+ moiety (470 nm) as shown in Fig. 3b. No decay of the absorption due to the ET state in Fig. 3b was observed. Thus, an almost infinite lifetime has been attained for the ET state (Acr˙–Mes˙+) at 77 K. Such a remarkably stable ET state is made possible by the high energy of the ET state (2.37 eV) that is located deeply in the Marcus inverted region [eqn. (1)]. Any excited state even triplet would never have such a nearly infinite lifetime at 77 K.

The triplet excited state of Acr+–Mes was reported to be 1.96 eV, that is lower than the ET state energy.38 However, this was found to be the triplet excited state due to the acridine impurity when Acr+–Mes was synthesized by the methylation of the corresponding acridine derivative.37 Thus, It is recommended to synthesize Acr+–Mes by the Grignard reaction of 10-methyl-9(10H)-acridone with 2-mesitylmagnesium bromide without involving methylation.36,37
The ET state (Acr˙–Mes˙+) has both the oxidizing and reducing ability, because the Acr˙ and Mes˙+ moieties act as a strong electron donor and an acceptor, respectively. The claim that the photoexcitation of Acr+–Mes results in formation of the triplet excited state rather than the ET state is totally inconsistent with the redox reactivity (vide infra). The one-electron oxidation potential (Eox) of the triplet excited state of Acr+–Mes would be −0.08 V vs.SCE, which is determined from the one-electron oxidation potential of the Mes moiety (1.88 V)36 if the reported triplet excitation energy (1.96 V) were correct.38 In such a case, electron transfer from the triplet excited state of Acr+–Mes to N,N-dihexylnaphthalene diimide (NIm: Ered = −0.46 V vs.SCE) would be energetically impossible judging from the positive free energy change of electron transfer (0.38 eV). However, the addition of NIm (1.0 × 10−3 mol dm−3) to a PhCN solution of Acr+–Mes and the laser photoirradiation results in the formation of NIm˙− as detected by the well-known absorption bands at 480 and 720 nm,39 accompanied by the decay of transient absorption at 510 nm due to the Acr˙ moiety of the ET state as shown in Fig. 4a.37NIm˙− can only be produced by electron transfer from the Acr˙ moiety (Eox = −0.57 V vs.SCE) in Acr˙–Mes˙+ to NIm (Ered = −0.46 V vs.SCE). The Acr˙ moiety in Acr˙–Mes˙+ has also been shown to reduce MVA2+-modified platinum clusters (MVA2+–PtC: E0red = −0.50 V).40

The oxidizing ability of the Mes˙+ moiety (Ered = 1.88 V vs.SCE) has also been demonstrated by the occurrence of electron transfer from an electron donor (aniline) to the Mes˙+ moiety in Acr˙–Mes˙+. The resulting aniline radical cation (λmax = 430 nm)41 is observed accompanied by decay of the absorbance due to the Mes˙+ moiety at 500 nm as shown in Fig. 4b.37 The formation rate constant of aniline radical cation is determined as 5.6 × 109 M−1 s−1,37 which is close to the diffusion rate constant in PhCN.42 The occurrence of electron transfer from various electron donors such as anthracene, tetraphenylethylene and C60 to the Mes˙+ moiety in Acr˙–Mes˙+ has also been confirmed by the observation of transient absorption spectra of the corresponding radical cations.43–45 Thus, the photogenerated state of Acr+–Mes has both the reducing and the oxidizing ability. It should be emphasized again that only the ET state (Acr˙–Mes˙+) has such a dual ability.
A long-lived ET state of a simple electron donor–acceptor dyad of acridinium ion has also been attained by using non-covalent bonding such as π–π interaction. Such use of non-covalent bonding has recently merited increasing attention as a simpler but more elegant way to construct electron donor–acceptor ensembles.46,47 A free base cofacial bisporphyrin, H4DPOx, forms a π-complex with acridinium ion (AcH+) by π–π interaction in PhCN (Scheme 1).48 Formation of the H4DPOx–AcH+π-complex was probed by the UV-Vis and NMR spectra.48 The binding constant between AcH+ and H4DPOx is determined as 9.7 × 104 dm3 mol−1.48 The optimized structure of the π-complex between H4DPOx and AcH+ by DFT calculation is shown in Fig. 5a.48 The HOMO (highest occupied molecular orbital) and LUMO (lowest unoccupied molecular orbital) of H4DPOx˙+-AcH˙ are localized on the porphyrin and AcH+ moieties as shown in Fig. 5b and 5c, respectively. Thus, photoinduced electron transfer from the singlet excited state (1H4DPOx*) to the AcH+ moiety in the π complex occurs efficiently to produce the ET state (H4DPOx˙+–AcH˙) upon photoexcitation of the H4DPOx moiety (Scheme 1).48

The occurrence of photoinduced electron transfer in the π-complex was confirmed by nanosecond laser flash photolysis.48 The quantum yield of the ET state at 298 K is determined as 0.90 ± 0.05.48 The energy diagram of photoinduced electron transfer in the H4DPOx–AcH+ complex is summarized in Scheme 2.48 The energy level of the ET state (−ΔGET) in the π-complex is determined as 1.28 eV from the redox potentials of the π-complex, which is lower than the that of the triplet states of H4DPOx (1.59 eV) and AcH+ (2.01 eV).48 This is the reason why the transient absorption spectra due to the ET state can be observed instead of the T-T absorption spectrum. The rate constant (kET) of electron transfer from the singlet excited state of H4DPOx (1H4DPOx*) to AcH+ in the H4DPOx–AcH complex was determined as 2.9 × 108 s−1 by time-resolved fluorescence measurements.48

The lifetime of the ET state exhibits large temperature dependence. The temperature dependence of the rate constant of back electron transfer (kET) is in accordance with the Marcus equation [eqn (1)] as shown in Fig. 6a.48 The plot of ln(kETT1/2) vs. T−1 affords a linear line in Fig. 6a. From the slope and the intercept, the λ and V values are determined as 0.54 ± 0.1 eV and 1.6 ± 0.3 cm−1, respectively.48

The extrapolated ET state lifetime at 77 K from the linear plot in Fig. 6a is estimated as 355 days. Such an extremely long-lived ET state is indeed shown by the steady-state photoirradiation of glassy 2-MeTHF containing 10% butyronitrile of H4DPOx–AcH+ by a 1000 W high-pressure mercury lamp at low temperature. The new absorption bands due to H4DPOx˙+ (450–540 nm and 620–800 nm) and AcH˙ (450–540 nm) are clearly observed as shown in Fig. 6b.48 The observed ET state exhibits no decay for 200 min at 77 K (inset of Fig. 6b).48 The color change from the ground state of the H4DPOx–AcH+ complex to the ET state is also shown in inset of Fig. 6b.48 It is important to note that the color and the absorption spectrum of the ET state is back to the original one when temperature is increased to 298 K and such a change can be repeated many times.48
Since the λ and V values are determined from the temperature dependence of kBET, the driving force dependence of the ET rate constant in the π-complex at 298 K is obtained according to eqn. (1) as shown in Fig. 7.48 The kET value of electron transfer from 1H4DPOx* to AcH+ in the H4DPOx–AcH complex (2.9 × 108 s−1) agrees with the predicted value from the Marcus curve within the experimental error (open circle in Fig. 7). The forward ET is nearly on the Marcus top region, whereas the BET process is deeply in the Marcus inverted region. This is the reason why an extremely long-lived ET state of the π-complex is formed in PhCN in particular at low temperature.

(1) with the λ (0.54 ± 0.01 eV) and V (1.6 ± 0.3 cm−1) values, derived from the temperature dependence of kBET in Fig. 6a, including the experimental values for photoinduced ET (○) and BET (●) in deaerated PhCN at 298 K.48 The broken curves indicate the error limit derived from uncertainty of the λ value and the V value. 
Formation of the simple π-complex formed between an electron donor and an acceptor with a long ET lifetime can be utilized to obtain more sophisticated electron donor–acceptor ensembles for construction of efficient energy conversion systems as described later.
The π–π interaction also plays an important role in diameter-selective separation of SWNTs from starting purified SWNTs by forming supramolecular nanohybrids between porphyrin-peptide hexadecamer [P(H2P)16] and SWNTs as shown in Fig. 8a.49 The supramolecular complex formation is made possible by wrapping of peptidic backbone in P(H2P)16 and π–π interaction between porphyrins and nanotubes to extract the large-diameter nanotubes (ca. 1.3 nm) as revealed by ultraviolet-visible-near infrared and Raman spectroscopy as well as high-resolution transmission electron microscopy.49 Laser photoexcitation of P(H2P)16/SWNTs in DMF results in appearance of prominent transient absorption bands at 450 nm together with a broad absorption band in the 500–800 nm region, which overlaps with a number of bleaching bands due to the porphyrin (518, 553, 597, and 649 nm) and SWNTs (750 nm) as shown in Fig. 8b (closed circles).49 By taking into account the bleaching bands, the observed transient absorption spectrum agrees with that of free base porphyrin radical cation.49 In contrast, no transient absorption is observed upon photoexcitation of P(H2P)16 (open circles in Fig. 8b).49 Thus, the observed transient absorption spectrum is assigned to the CS state of P(H2P)16/SWNTs, that is produced by photoinduced electron transfer from the singlet and triplet excited states of P(H2P)16 to SWNTs. The CS lifetime is determined as 0.37 ± 0.03 ms from the first-order decay of the absorbance due to the CS state (Fig. 8c).49 This method opens a new strategy toward the extraction of large-diameter SWNTs without destruction of the π-conjugated system within SWNTs and development of an efficient light energy conversion system.

Photocatalytic functions of Acr+–Mes
As described above, photoexcitation of Acr+–Mes results in formation of the ET state (Acr˙–Mes˙+), which has both the high oxidizing and reducing ability with a sufficiently long lifetime for the occurrence of ET reactions with electron donors and acceptors in competition with the BET. In such a case Acr+–Mes can be utilized as an efficient photocatalyst for radical coupling reactions between radical cations and radical anions, which are produced by the ET oxidation and ET reduction of external electron donors and acceptors, respectively (Scheme 3).
 Scheme 3  Photocatalytic reaction of an electron donor (D) and an acceptor (A) with the ET state of Acr+–Mes to form D–A via radical coupling between D˙+ and A˙+. 
When anthracene and O2 are employed as an electron donor and an acceptor, anthracene radical cation and O2˙− are formed by electron transfer from anthracene to the Mes˙+ moiety of Acr˙–Mes˙+ and electron transfer from the Acr˙ moiety of Acr˙–Mes˙+ to O2, respectively, following the photoexcitation of Acr+–Mes (Scheme 4).43 The oxygenation product of anthracene, i.e., epidioxyanthracene (An-O2), is produced via the radical coupling between anthracene radical cations and O2˙−, [4+2] cycloaddition.43 The same [4+2]cycloadduct can be obtained by the reaction of anthracene with singlet oxygen (1O2). However, it is important to note that An-O2 is formed exclusively by the radical coupling between anthracene radical cation and O2˙− rather than the reaction of anthracene and 1O2.43 Other anthracene derivatives such as 9,10-dimethylanthracene and 9-methylanthracene also undergo photocatalytic oxygenation with Acr+–Mes to afford the corresponding epidioxyanthracenes under the photoirradiation.43 In the case of anthracene, the further photoirradiation results in formation of anthraquinone as the final six-electron oxidation product, via10-hydroxyanthrone, accompanied by generation of H2O2 (Scheme 4).43

The mechanism of the photocatalytic conversion of epidioxyanthracene (An-O2) to 10-hydroxyanthrone and further to anthraquinone is shown in Scheme 5.43 The electron transfer from An-O2 to the Mes˙+ moiety of Acr˙–Mes˙+, produced upon photoexcitation of Acr+–Mes, results in the O–O bond cleavage of An-O2, followed by facile intramolecular hydrogen transfer to produce10-hydroxyanthrone radical cation. The back electron transfer from the Acr˙ moiety to 10-hydroxyanthrone radical cationaffords 10-hydroxyanthrone, accompanied by regeneration of Acr+–Mes (Scheme 5). 10-Hydroxyanthrone is further oxidized by the Mes˙+ moiety of Acr˙–Mes˙+ to yield anthraquinone by releasing two protons, whereas the two-electron reduction of O2 by the acridinyl radical moiety of Acr˙–Mes˙+ with two protons yield H2O2 (Scheme 5).

H2O2 is manufactured today almost exclusively by the autoxidation of 2-ethyl-9,10-dihydroxyanthracene to 2-ethylanthraquinone and H2O2 using oxygen from the air.50 The anthraquinone derivative is then extracted out and reduced back to the dihydroxy compound using H2 gas in the presence of a metal catalyst.50 The current process is only economic at a large scale and the economics of the process depends on effective recycling of the quinone and extraction solvents, and of the hydrogenation catalyst. It is highly desired to produce H2O2 using an inexpensive hydrogen source other than H2 gas. It has been shown that H2O2 is produced by the photocatalytic reduction of O2 by aromatic compounds contained in MeCN-extracted coal tar with Acr+–Mes that acts as an effective and stable photocatalyst via the ET oxidation of aromatic compounds contained in the MeCN-extracted coal tar and the ET reduction of O2 with the ET state of Acr+–Mes produced upon photoexcitation.51 This photocatalytic method provides an environmentally benign approach for the production of H2O2 using coal tar.
The radical coupling reaction between anthracene radical cation and O2˙− to produce An-O2 in Scheme 4 has been expanded to the dioxetane formation from olefins.44 1,2-Dioxetanes have been usually prepared by the [2+2]cycloaddition of singlet oxygen (1O2) to electron-rich alkenes.52,53 If alkenes are too electron poor to react with 1O2, however, no oxygenated products were obtained. For example, no dioxetane was produced by the reaction of 1O2 with tetraphenylethylene (TPE).54 When Acr+–Mes is used as a photocatalyst, however, the photocatalytic oxygenation of TPE with O2 occurs efficiently with Acr+–Mes via the radical coupling between TPE radical cation (TPE˙+) and O2˙−, both of which were produced by ET reactions of TPE and O2 with the photogenerated ET state of Acr+–Mes (Acr˙–Mes˙+), leading to successful isolation of the corresponding 1,2-dioxetane for the first time (Scheme 6).44 The dioxetane is further oxidized by Acr˙–Mes˙+ to produce the dioxetane radical cation, which undergoes the O–O bond homolysis to produce benzophenone and the radical cation (Scheme 6).44 The benzophenone radical caion is reduced by Acr˙–Mes to produce another benzophenone, accompanied by regeneration of Acr+–Mes (Scheme 6).44

The Acr+–Mes acts as an efficient photocatalyst for oxygenation of triphenylphosphine (Ph3P) to triphenylphosphine oxide (Ph3PO) with O2.55 Photooxidation of benzylamine (PhCH2NH2) with O2 also occurs efficiently under photoirradiation of Acr+–Mes to yield PhCH2NCHPh and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2).55 Photooxygenation of naphthalene derivatives also proceeds efficiently using Acr+–Mes as a photocatalst.56 Each photocatalytic reaction is initiated by intramolecular photoinduced ET from the Mes moiety to the singlet excited state of the Acr+ moiety to produce the ET state (Acr˙–Mes˙+).55 Thus, the use of Acr+–Mes as an ET photocatalyst in the presence of O2 provides a convenient methodology to produce radical cations of electron donors and O2˙−, which can combine together to yield the oxygenated products selectively in a preparative scale.57
When the ET oxidation of an electron donor by the Mes˙+ moiety of Acr˙–Mes˙+ is coupled with deprotonation of the resulting radical cation and the dissosiative ET reduction of a halogenated compound by the Acr˙ moiety of Acr˙–Mes˙+, the homocoupling product can be obtained. For example, photocatalytic coupling of 9,10-dimethylanthracene (DMA) in chloroform occurs efficiently via the ET oxidation of DMA by the Mes˙+ moiety of Acr˙–Mes˙+, followed by deprotonation from the methyl group of DMA radical cation and the radical coupling reaction between the resulting anthracenylmethyl radicals to produce lepidopterene (5,6,11,12-tetrahydro-4b,12-[1′,2′],6,10b[1″,2″]-dibenzenochrysene) together with 1,2-bis(9-anthracenyl)ethane as shown in Scheme 7.58 The Acr˙ moiety of Acr˙–Mes, which is produced by electron transfer from DMA to Acr˙–Mes˙+, is oxidized by dissociative electron transfer to CHCl3 to produce CHCl2˙ and Cl−. The CHCl2˙ radicals dimerize to yield 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane (CHCl2CHCl2). The deprotonation from the methyl group of DMA˙+ is the key step for formation of lepidopterene in Scheme 7. In the case of unsubstituted anthracene, there is no methyl group to be deprotonated in the radical cation. In the case of 9,10-diethylanthracene, the deprotonation from the ethyl group in the radical cation may be too slow to compete with the back electron transfer.58 Thus, in neither case, photodimerization has occurred.
 Scheme 7  Photocatalytic dimerization of 9,10-dimethylanthracene with Acr+–Mes in CHCl3.58 
If one chooses a substrate that has the smaller HOMO–LUMO gap than the ET state energy of Acr+–Mes (2.73 eV), both the radical cation and radical anion of the substrate can be formed by the ET oxidation and reduction with Acr˙–Mes˙+, respectively. Fullerenes are known to have relatively small HOMO–LUMO gap and also suitable for efficient ET oxidation and reduction because of the small ET reorganization energy.59–61 The free energy change of electron transfer from C60 (Eox = 1.73 V vs.SCE)62 to the Mes˙+ moiety of Acr˙–Mes˙+ (Eox = 1.88 V)36 and that of electron transfer from the Acr˙ moiety (Ered = −0.49 V)36 to C60 (Ered = −0.43 V)63 are both negative and thereby both the ET oxidation and reduction of C60 with Acr˙–Mes˙+ are energetically feasible. Thus, C60 acts as both an electron donor and acceptor in ET reactions of the ET state (Acr˙–Mes˙+) with C60 to produce C60˙+ and C60˙− at the same time. The formation of both C60˙+ and C60˙− is confirmed by a nanosecond laser excitation at 430 nm of a deaerated PhCN solution containing Acr+–Mes and C60 as shown in Fig. 9a,45 where the transient absorption bands due to C60˙+ (960 nm)61,64 and C60˙− (1080 nm) are observed.42 The transient absorption bands due to C60˙+ and C60˙− disappears, and this coincides with appearance of a new absorption band at 740 nm due to 3C60* (Fig. 9b).45 The formation rate constant of 3C60* generated by the charge recombination between C60˙+ and C60˙− was determined as 5.2 × 105 s−1. The decay at 740 nm obeys first-order kinetics and the decay rate constant of 3C60* is determined as 1.0 × 105 s−1.65
 Fig. 9  (a) Transient absorption spectra in PhCN observed in photoinduced ET oxidation of C60 (1.0 × 10−4 mol dm−3) with Acr+–MesClO4− (1.0 × 10−4 mol dm−3) taken 1.0 and 4.0 μs after laser excitation at 430 nm at 298 K.45 (b) Time profiles at 740, 960 and 1080 nm in PhCN.45 
The [2+2]cycloaddition occurs efficiently between C60˙+ and C60˙− in a non-polar solvent (toluene/MeCN) to afford 3C120* (Scheme 8),45 because the driving force of charge recombination (2.16 eV) is larger than the triplet excited state energy of C120 (ca. 1.5 eV).65 The slower charge recombination in a non-polar solvent (Tol/MeCN) than that in PhCN leads to the efficient formation of C120. Further oligomerization may occur by the same process (Scheme 8).45 The quantum yield of dimer formation (Φ) under photoirradiation with monochromatized light (λ = 430 nm) was determined from a increase in absorbance at 700 nm due to C60 adducts to be 0.75.45 It should be emphasized that there was no photochemical reaction of C60 without Acr+–Mes under otherwise the same experimental conditions.45 The photocatalytic cycloadditionvia formation of both radical cation and radical anion of a substrate with Acr+–Mes provides a new synthetic pathway that could not be exploited using a classical concerted pathway.

The ET state of Acr+–Mes is also useful for the detection of the transient absorption spectra of radical cations of electron donors, which can be readily produced by ET from electron donors to the Mes˙+ moiety. The transient absorption band at 460 nm due to the radical cation of linoleic acid was detected by photoexcitation of Acr+–Mes in the presence of linoleic acid in MeCN.66 The deprotonation of the radical cation of linoleic acid was determined from the first-order decay of the absorbance at 460 nm as 1.1 × 104 s−1.66
The oxidizing ability of the Mes˙+ moiety of Acr˙–Mes˙+ is strong enough to produce radical cations of all types of DNA bases as well as DNA by the one-electron oxidation.67 Radical cations of GMP (guanosine 5′-monophosphate), AMP (adenosine 5′-monophosphate), CMP (cytidine 5′-monophosphate) and TMP (thymidine 5′-monophosphate) have been detected as the transient absorption spectra in the laser flash photolysis measurements in photoinduced ET oxidation of DNA bases with Acr˙–Mes˙+ in an aqueous solution.67 The absorption maxima of the radical cations of CMP, TMP and AMP in the range from 450 to 550 nm are similar to that of GMP˙+,68 although the absorption intensity varies depending on DNA bases.67 The ket values of electron transfer at pH 7.0 from CMP, TMP and AMP are also determined as 2.2 × 105, 1.2 × 105 and 7.6 × 105 dm3 mol−1 s−1, respectively.67 Calf thymus DNA was also efficiently oxidized by the Mes˙+ moiety of Acr˙–Mes˙+.67 It should be noted that there is no intercalation of a bulky Acr+–Mes with double-stranded DNA because the dihedral angle between Acr+ and Mes moieties of Acr+–Mes is perpendicular.36 The largest ket value of the ET oxidation of GMP together with the lowest oxidation potential of GMP among DNA bases indicates that guanine is eventually oxidized in ET from DNA to the Mes˙+ moiety of Acr˙–Mes˙+, leading to the efficient DNA cleavage (Scheme 9).67
 Scheme 9  Photocatalytic DNA cleavage with Acr+–Mes.67 
The reactivity of DNA cleavage after 5 min photoirradiation of pBR 322 with the monochromatized light (λ = 360 nm) in the presence of Acr+–Mes is compared with those in the presence of 9-substituted acridinium ions without an electron donor moiety (AcrR+, R = H, iPr and Ph) as shown in Fig. 10.67 The reactivity of DNA cleavage increases in the following order: AcrPh+ < AcrH+, AcriPr+ ≪ Acr+–Mes.67 The low reactivity of AcrPh+ results from the short fluorescence lifetime (1.3 ns) of 1AcrPh+* (* denotes the excited state) as compared with those of 1AcriPr+* (26 ns) and 1AcrH+* (31 ns).67 The highest reactivity of Acr+–Mes may results from the extremely long-lived ET state.36 It is interesting to note that the DNA cleavage activity with Acr+–Mes in the absence of O2 is much higher than that in the presence of O2 at pH 5.0 and 7.0 as shown in Fig. 10b. The retarding effect of O2 may result from more efficient back ET from O2˙− to DNA radical cation as compared with that from the Acr˙ moiety to DNA radical cation before oxidizing DNA (Scheme 9).67

        Hydrogen (H2) is a clean energy source for the future to reduce dependence on fossil fuels and emissions of greenhouse gases in the long-term.69 A number of photocatalytic hydrogen-evolution systems have been developed in the past decades.70–77 Such systems usually consist of an electron donor, a photosensitizer, an electron mediator such as methyl viologen (MV2+) and a hydrogen-evolution catalyst. A highly efficient photocatalytic hydrogen-evolution system without an electron mediator such as methyl viologen (MV2+) has been constructed using 9-mesityl-10-methylacridinium ion (Acr+–Mes), poly(N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone)-protected platinum nanoclusters (Pt-PVP) and NADH (β-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, reduced form), used as a photocatalyst, a hydrogen-evolution catalyst and an electron donor, respectively.78 To our surprise, the hydrogen-evolution rate of the photocatalytic system in the absence of MV2+ is 300 times faster than that with MV2+ as shown in Fig. 11.78 The photocatalyst (Acr+–Mes) undergoes photoinduced electron transfer from the Mes moiety to the singlet excited state of the Acr+ moiety to produce an extremely long-lived ET state, which is capable of oxidizing NADH and reducing Pt-PVP, leading to efficient hydrogen evolution. The total quantum yield of hydrogen-evolution (ΦH2) was determined as 26 ± 3%.78 The significant retarding effect of MV2+ on the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution in Fig. 11 is attributed to efficient ET from Acr˙–Mes to MV2+, which results in formation of MV˙+ that is much less reactive than Acr˙–Mes for the reduction of Pt-PVP to produce hydrogen.

Organic solar cells with donor–acceptor ensembles
The requirement to develop inexpensive renewable energy sources has stimulated new approaches for production of efficient, low-cost organic photovoltaic devices.79–82 A new type of organic solar cells have been constructed based on TiO2nanoparticles modified with supramolecular self-assembly clusters of 9-mesityl-10-carboxymethyl-acridinium ion (Fig. 12) and fullerene, which are deposited as thin films on optically transparent electrode (OTE) of nanostructured SnO2 (OTE/SnO2) using an electrophoretic method.83 9-Mesityl-10-methylacridinium ion which exhibits slow charge-recombination of the ET state with remarkably high energy,36 is modified with carboxylic acid group (Mes-Acr+-COOH in Fig. 12)84 to be assembled on TiO2nanoparticles [denoted as Mes-Acr+-COO-TiO2 in Fig. 12].83 The photoelectrochemical performance of nanostructured SnO2 film of TiO2nanoparticles modified with composite clusters of Mes-Acr+-COOH and fullerene [denoted as OTE/SnO2/(Mes-Acr+-COO-TiO2 + C60)n] is superior to the OTE/SnO2/(Acr+-COO- TiO2 + C60)nelectrode, in which acridinium moiety (Acr+) contains no donor moiety.83

The photocurrent action spectrum of the OTE/SnO2/(Mes-Acr+-COO-TiO2 + C60)nelectrode shows a maximum IPCE value of 37% at an applied potential of 0.2 V vs.SCE.83 The photocurrent generation is initiated by photoinduced electron transfer in Mes-Acr+ to produce Mes˙+-Acr˙. The reduced acridinium ion (Acr˙; E0(Acr+/Acr˙) = −0.3 V vs.NHE)36 injects electrons into the conduction band of SnO2 (E0 = 0 V vs.NHE),85 whereas the oxidized Mes moiety (Mes˙+; E0(Mes˙+/Mes) = 2.0 V vs.NHE)36 undergoes the ET reduction by iodide ion (E0(I3−/I−) = 0.5 V vs.NHE)85 in the electrolyte solution (Scheme 11).
 Scheme 11  Photocurrent generation diagram at the OTE/SnO2/(Mes-Acr+-COO- TiO2)nelectrode.83 
Improvement in the photoelectrochemical properties of the composite of Mes-Acr+-COOH and C60 nanoclusters has been achieved due to the effective organization of the supramolecular complex on TiO2nanoparticles, the extremely long lifetime of the ET state of Mes-Acr+-COOH, and efficient electron transfer from Acr˙ to C60.83

Electron donor–acceptor ensembles are effectively assembled using self-organization of porphyrin (donor) and fullerene (acceptor) units by clusterization with gold nanoparticles on nanostructured SnO2electrodes as shown in Fig. 13.86
 Fig. 13  Construction of composite electrodes of supramolecular complexes between porphyrin gold nanoparticles (H2PCnMPC, ZnPCnMPC: n is the number of methylene groups in the spacer) and C60.86 

        Porphyrin alkanethiolate monolayer-protected gold nanoparticles (H2PCnMPC: n is the number of methylene groups in the spacer) are prepared by self-assembly of porphyrin-alkanethiol on gold nanoparticles.86 These porphyrin-modified gold nanoparticles form supramolecular π complexes with C60 and they are clusterized in acetonitrile/toluene mixed solvent.86 Then, the highly colored composite clusters can be assembled as three-dimensional arrays onto nanostructured SnO2 films to afford the OTE/SnO2/(H2PCnMPC + C60)melectrode using an electrophoretic deposition method.86
The film of the composite clusters with gold nanoparticle exhibits an incident photon-to-photocurrent efficiency (IPCE) as high as 54% and broad photocurrent action spectra (up to 1000 nm).86 The power conversion efficiency of OTE/SnO2/- (H2PC15MPC + C60)m system increases with increasing the number of the alkyl chain length (n) of porphyrin-alkanethiol to reach a maximum value (η = 1.5%) with n = 15.86 The apparent association constants (Kapp) of formation of supramolecular complexes between H2PCnMPC and C60 also increase with the number of the alkyl chain length (n) to reach a maximum with n = 15, when the distance of two porphyrin rings of porphyrins on gold nanoparticle is best fitted to form the π complex of C60 between the two porphyrin rings.86b The largest Kapp value of the supramolecular π complex between H2PC15MPC and C60 leads to the largest IPCE and η values of OTE/SnO2/(H2PC15MPC + C60)m.86 The η value (1.5%) is remarkably enhanced (about 45 times) in comparison with the OTE/SnO2/(H2P-ref + C60)m system (η = 0.035%) under the same experimental conditions.86 Such remarkable enhancement in the photoelectrochemical performance as well as broader photoresponse in the visible and infrared relative to the reference systems demonstrates that the supramolecular organization approach of the porphyrin gold nanoparticles and fullerenes provides novel perspective for the development of efficient organic solar cells.
Molecular clusters of porphyrin dendrimers can also be used instead of porphyrin gold nanoparticles to construct supramolecular solar cells with C60.87 In this case, however, the light energy conversion property decreases with increasing the dendritic generations because of the ‘rigid’ structure of porphyrin dendrimers, which hampers effective interaction between the porphyrin units and C60 in the higher dendritic generation.87
In contrast the porphyrin dendrimers, porphyrin-peptide oligomers with a polypeptidic backbone88 are flexible enough to accommodate C60 between the porphyrin units and no quenching of the excited state of porphyrins is observed as compared with the monomer porphyrin in contrast with the case of porphyrin alkanethiolate monolayer-protected gold nanoparticles.89 Thus, supramolecular solar cells composed of a series of porphyrin-peptide oligomers [porphyrin functionalized α-polypeptides: P(H2P)n or P(ZnP)n (n = 1, 2, 4, 8, 16)] and C60 assembled on a nanostructured SnO2electrode were constructed using an electrophoretic deposition method.89 Formation of supramolecular clusters of porphyrins and fullerenes prepared in acetonitrile–toluene = 3 : 1 has been confirmed by transmission electron micrograph (TEM) and the absorption spectra.89 Remarkable enhancement in the photoelectrochemical performance as well as the broader photoresponse in the visible and near-infrared regions is seen with increasing the number of porphyrin units in α-polypeptide structures (Fig. 14).89 The power conversion efficiency (η) of (P(H2P)16 + C60)m modified electrode reaches 1.6%, which is 40 times higher than the value (0.043%) of the porphyrin monomer (P(H2P)1 + C60)m modified electrode (Fig. 14).89 Such a supramolecular organization approach between porphyrins and fullerenes with polypeptide structures provides a promising way to further improve the light energy conversion properties by using larger number of porphyrins in a polypeptide unit.

Summary and outlook
As demonstrated in this review, simple electron donor–acceptor ensembles, linked by covalent and non-covalent bonds are capable of fast charge separation with extremely slow charge recombination of high energy CS states provided that the reorganization energy of electron transfer is minimized in the light of the Marcus theory of electron transfer. Such simple electron donor–acceptor ensembles provide a variety of applications for photoinduced ET catalytic systems including radical coupling of radical ions produced by ET of electron donors and acceptors with the CS states and the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. Bioinspired supramolecular approaches to assemble electron donor–acceptor ensembles are also important to construct solar cells for efficient the solar energy conversion. The scope of the use of simple electron donor–acceptor ensembles, linked by covalent and non-covalent bonds, may be expanded further to develop more efficient artificial photosynthetic systems aiming at solving global energy and environmental problems.
