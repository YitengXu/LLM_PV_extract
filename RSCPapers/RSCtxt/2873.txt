    , Accepted 21st February 2022First published on 22nd February 2022AbstractMetal@hollow carbon sphere nanoreactors (MHCSs) are gradually attracting attention owing to their well-defined active sites, confined void space and controllable mass transfer rates with adjustable chemical composition in the fields of photocatalysis, electrocatalysis, and thermal catalysis related to biomass and CO2 valorization.

Introduction
In the natural world, many living organisms have hollow cavity structures, such as vesicles, viruses and cells. The combination of the hollow structure of these substances and their properties, such as transmembrane proteins, sensitive pore channels and recognizable functions, provides them with distinctive features to stimulate various essential life activities.1,2 This specific structure provides a meaningful reference for the exploitation of a key type of biomimetic nanoreactors, referred to as metal@hollow carbon sphere nanoreactors (MHCSs).
MHCSs with unique characteristics show enormous advantages as promising candidates for the rational design of effective model catalysts, such as confined hollow cavity, adjustable porous channel/pore structure, modifiable surface composition and optionally adequate locations for flexible loading of metal particles.3–5 All these characteristics contribute to the unique and excellent confined microenvironmental effects of the MHCS nanoreactors, including the mass transfer effect, metal size effect, void confinement effect, spatial compartmentation effect, and surface modification effect, which play vital roles in the field of catalysis. Typically, the suitable hollow cavities with the void confinement effect provide a concentrated microenvironment for substance enrichment. Sun et al.6 have successfully synthesized hollow graphitic carbon nitride nanospheres using silica nanoparticles as a template for photocatalytic hydrogen experiments. The hollow nanospheres were shown to have multiple light reflections within the hollow structure, increasing the effective path length for light absorption and the advantage of effective light enrichment, resulting in a significant increase in photochemical activity, which was determined to have an apparent quantum yield of 7.5% through hydrogen generation tests. Long et al.7 prepared porous spherical carbon (PS-Pd–C/N) and hollow carbon spheres (H-Pd–C/N) by the polymerization of dopamine for the reduction of 4-nitrophenol to 4-aminophenol. The higher catalytic activity exhibited by H-Pd–C/N was attributed to the unique porous hollow structure with an ultra-thin porous shell as a nanoreactor for enrichment of reactants, high nitrogen content, and a rich distribution of active sites. Additionally, the adjustable pore structure on the carbon shell confers significant molecular sieving effects on the nanoreactor, strongly determining the adsorption and diffusion behavior of substrate molecules in the microenvironment through the size selection effect, and permeable thin shells for shortening charge diffusion paths. Gao et al.8 prepared hollow porous carbon spheres loaded Pd catalysts (Pd@HPCNs) via a hyper-crosslinking mediated self-assembly strategy and subsequently a “ship in bottle” method. The Pd@HPCN nanoreactors exhibited size-selective oxidation of 4-biphenylbenzenemethanol and benzyl alcohol due to the molecular sieve effect of the microporous hollow carbon shells. Remarkably, MHCSs could perform attractive space compartmentation effects for a wider range of catalytic applications in a variety of cascade reactions, which show great potential for replacing cost-intensive redundant operations. Wang et al.9 exploited silica as a template to construct Janus surfaces in which Co3O4 and Pt particles were loaded on the outer and inner surfaces of nitrogen-doped carbon nanospheres, respectively. This spatially separated surface spatially conferred the hollow carbon nitride spheres with separated reduction and oxidation active sites, allowing unidirectional migration of the electron and hole to inhibit unwanted inverse reactions of water splitting and decrease charge recombination, thus exhibiting enhanced photocatalytic water separation activity. Thus, due to these unique confinement microenvironmental characteristics, multifunctional MHCSs are attracting increasing research attention for catalytic processes, particularly CO2 and biomass conversion for the producing renewable fuels and chemicals.
To date, with the substantial consumption of fossil fuels such as oil, coal and natural gas, and their associated CO2 emissions, the selectively targeted conversion of CO2 and biomass has become an important way to address energy depletion and increased environmental pollution issues.11–13 However, the efficient selective conversion of biomass platforms under relatively mild reaction conditions is challenging, as the key issues of the reaction process are generally high H2 pressure and high reaction temperature. Furthermore, the linear CO2 molecule is a highly oxidized state of carbon, which makes CO2 molecule highly thermodynamically stable and difficult to deform, thus achieving efficient CO2 conversion processes is challenging.14,15 Therefore, an external energy supply (e.g. photons, electricity, heat) and the necessary catalysts are essential for the efficient conversion of CO2. At present, the roadmaps of CO2 and biomass valorization are gradually being complemented including thermal catalytic,16–18 photocatalytic19–21 and electrocatalytic22–24 pathways through continuous research efforts; especially MHCSs with adjustable confined microenvironmental effects are receiving extensive attention to achieve a renewable carbon cycle (Fig. 1). Through targeted modulation of the specific structural parameters and chemical composition of the MHCS nanoreactors with carbon matrix and metal nanoparticles, the microenvironmental effects can be precisely modulated in order to selectively enhance, diminish or even eliminate the interaction between the metal and carrier to effectively achieve the desired reactions.25,26 Chen et al.27 produced hollow carbon nitride nanospheres with encapsulated Rh NPs via a one-pot synthesis strategy in which hexamethylenetetramine was used as a nitrogen source to modify the carbon matrix for the hydrodeoxygenation of phenol. The smaller metal size and more dispersed Rh nanoparticles (NPS) in the nitrogen-doped hollow carbon nanoreactors led to 100% conversion of phenol and 99% yield of cyclohexanol, much higher than that of the non-nitrogen-doped nanoreactor. Yang et al.28 prepared a series of Pd–Cu alloy nanoparticles confined within the mesoporous hollow carbon sphere (MHCS) matrix by a top-down method for the hydrogenation of CO2. The optimized Pd2Cu14–N@MHCS catalysts, obtained by co-reduction with a Pd loading of about 1 wt% and a Pd/Cu molar ratio of 2:14, showed a high turnover number (TON) of 1432 after 24 h. Li et al.29 embedded monodisperse and coordinated unsaturated Ni–N active sites in hollow carbon spheres with abundant microporosity for efficient CO2 reduction reactions. The high N content of melamine could anchor Ni atoms to produce Ni–N active sites at high temperatures, obtaining highly dispersed individual Ni atoms. The rich micropores of the hollow carbon sphere could adsorb and confine hydrated Ni2+ during calcination procedure, further inhibiting the aggregation of Ni atoms. In addition, the content and coordination structure of Ni atoms could be easily adjusted by varying the calcination temperature. As a result, the optimized catalyst achieves a faradaic efficiency (FE) of more than 90% of CO over a wide potential window from −0.6 to −1.0 V, with a FECOmax of 97% at approximately −0.8 V. Thus, MHCSs with desired confinement effects promise more possibilities for further catalytic performance improvement of biomass and CO2 conversion.

MHCSs have shown tremendous advantages in the catalysis of biomass and CO2 upgradation, while the controlled confinement synthesis for constructing required MHCSs and the mechanisms of CO2 and biomass upgrading reactions affected by confined microenvironmental effects are inadequately summarized. This perspective provides recent advances in the design and construction of multifunctional MHCSs with excellent confined microenvironmental effects for the conversion of CO2 and biomass into a variety of renewable fuels and chemicals, as shown in Fig. 2. Here, we focus specifically on typical confined synthesis strategies to design functional catalysts according to functionalization approaches and the structure–activity correlations. Then the merits of the confined microenvironmental effects of MHCS nanoreactors are presented with regard to some detailed case studies. In addition, extensive discussions on the directed conversion of biomass and CO2 by MHCSs through photocatalysis, electrocatalysis, and thermal catalysis are illustrated. Finally, the future horizons and current challenges of multifunctional MHCSs for broader biomass and CO2 conversion are provided, offering guidance for the rational development of efficient catalysts for advanced conversion systems.

Confined synthesis strategies
The confined synthesis strategies of MHCSs could be mainly classified into three types of methods: post-synthetic procedure, pre-synthetic process and one-step in situ confinement strategy depending on whether the metal core or the shell is fabricated first.30 The three typical preparation strategies for the targeted engineering of the distinctive encapsulated structures of MHCS nanoreactors allow for a metal stabilization effect to show significant advantages in terms of inhibiting leaching and sintering behavior, thus providing increased possibilities for achieving long-lasting catalytic stability.31,32 Meanwhile, the physical structure and chemical composition of MHCSs, including the cavity curvature, shell thickness, porous structure, spatially separated structures, surface defects, heteroatomic doping and functional groups, are manipulable during the confined synthesis process to optimize the catalytic performance and meet the various demands of the catalytic process.30,33
Post-synthetic strategy
The post-synthetic strategy begins with formation of the carbon sphere shell, followed by introducing the core materials, where voids and pores inside the carbon spheres provide areas for the loading of metal NPs.34 The process based on this strategy could be achieved by means of immersing carbon sphere supports in metal colloids (or NPs) or soluble metal precursors, ion exchange and other strategies. The properties of the resulting MHCSs, such as the shell thickness, void space size, alloy composition, and chemical components are usually tunable during the synthesis process35(Table 1). Wang et al.36 prepared catalysts of noble metals grown within hollow mesoporous silica sphere nanostructures in bottle ships, which exhibited excellent catalytic performance in the catalytic oxidation of o-phenylenediamine with hydrogen peroxide. Specifically, small gold seeds were implanted inside the hollow spheres, and gold nanospheres with an average diameter of 18 ± 2 nm were formed through seed-mediated intra-microsphere growth. In addition, they formed many larger pores in the shell through calcination and hydrothermal treatment process, providing efficient channels for rapid solute exchange outside and inside the hollow microspheres. However, during the synthesis process, gold crystal seeds were shaped both outside and inside the nano-shell, which were removed by centrifugation, resulting in low atomic utilization. Therefore, the loading location of metal nanoparticles remains a huge challenge owing to the fact that precursors could be deposited randomly on the inside and outer surface of the carrier, resulting in low atomic utilization.

Considerable endeavors have been made to resolve the problem of targeted deposition of metal nanoparticles where possible, and to further modify the physical structure and chemical composition of the nanoreactors during the carbon sphere support preparation process to achieve targeted and precise preparation. For example, Wang et al.37 successfully encapsulated Pt ultrasmall nanoparticles in a Janus amphiphilic structure nanoreactor, which achieved one-pot oxidation–condensation cascade reaction of alcohols and amines to imines in high yields. In a typical synthesis process, polybenzoxazine (PB) spheres are uniformly coated with a mesosilica (mSiO2) layer to form PB@mSiO2 in a core/shell structure. After carbonization, the internal PB spheres were transformed into nitrogen-doped hollow carbon shells, partially embedded in mSiO2 shells, resulting in Janus NxC@mSiO2 hollow nanospheres. Finally, catalytically active ultrasmall Pt NPs were introduced into the nitrogen-doped carbon matrix by the impregnation–reduction method, yielding multifunctional amphiphilic Pt/NxC@mSiO2 nanoreactors. The superior hydrophilic/hydrophobic Janus structure enhances both the adsorption of hydrophobic alcohols in water and the desorption of water molecules as the by-product from the active sites. Moreover, the nitrogen-doped carbon material provides not only an abundance of basic active sites but also solid sites to anchor the metal NPs (Fig. 3). Liu et al.38 reported that metal ions can be adsorbed onto the amino group sites of pre-synthesized mesoporous aminophenol formaldehyde (APF) nanospheres using coordination-type interactions between the metal NPs and amine groups through an impregnation strategy. These nanospheres were coated with a layer of mesoporous SiO2 and carbonized to form hollow carbon shells within which the metal nanoparticles are formed. A further layer of APF@SiO2 nanospheres was coated with APF, resulting in a yolk–shell structure with metal nanoparticles in both the yolk and the shell. This facile synthesis approach ensured that uniformly dispersed monometallic (Au, Rh, Ag, Pd, Pt, Ru) and bimetallic (AuPt, AuRh and PtRh) nanoparticles were confined within different morphologies, including core–shell, mesoporous carbon sphere and hollow nanoparticles.

In summary, despite the simplicity of the post-synthesis strategy in concept, this method tends to have a few disadvantages, including the low atom utilization and the tedious process, mainly related to the challenge of ensuring that the reaction takes place entirely within the shell.
Pre-synthetic strategy
Pre-synthetic strategies, also known as pre-core-post-shell methods, have become one of the popular methods for producing MHCSs, as they provide a simple and reproducible route to producing highly customizable porous materials with a wide range of compositions (Table 2).34 This method requires metal nanoparticles to be covered with a spacer layer template, or deposited on top of the template and then coated with an outer layer fabricated from the target materials. Subsequently, templates should be readily removed via chemical etching or heat treatment process, and a technique of removal is highly desirable as this is generally associated with reduced costs and production times.30 A number of common template types, including surfactants, polymers, silica, and metal oxides, have been used as templates for the preparation of nanoreactors.43–45 Yang et al.43 demonstrated an ‘inside-out’ synthetic strategy to achieve individual Ru nanoparticles anchored within yolk-structured nanospheres, which exhibited significantly higher cycling stability during aqueous levulinic acid hydrogenation in water. The Ru colloids stabilized with polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) were layer-by-layer coated with silica and modified chitosan (nitrogen and carbon source) to produce a nitrogen doped core–shell configuration. Subsequent pyrolysis and NaOH washing induced outward movement of the oxidized Ru NPs of approximately 4.2 nm sizes after removal of the silica precursor. The resulting shell-supported–core configuration was produced by optimized core–shell interaction, where metal NPs were firmly anchored to the nitrogen-doped carbon shells with an intense metal and support effect. Liu et al.46 synthesized homogeneous silica templates with controllable diameters and amine group functionality, using the intense chemical affinity between the amine group and Au ions to deposit Au on the SiO2 core surface. Afterwards, resorcinol and formaldehyde resins (RF) were richly coated on the SiO2/Au colloids, followed by carbonization and removal of the SiO2 template with NaOH to successfully confine Au in nitrogen-doped hollow carbon nanospheres. Notably, varying the concentration of RF precursors to systematically reduce the shell thicknesses of the hollow carbon spheres can effectively decrease or eliminate mass transfer limitation in the reduction of hydrophobic nitrobenzene and hydrophilic 4-nitrophenol (Fig. 4).

It is worth noting that metal–organic frameworks are promising hard templates for preparing MHCSs because due to their superior chemical stability and homogeneous pore size, organic ligands and metal nodes can be used as the source of active sites.47–49 Liu's group50 reported a method for preparing cobalt oxide cores and cobalt metal encapsulated within porous N-doped hollow carbon capsules. The core–shell structure of the Zn/Co-ZIF@polymer material was synthesized by a simple polymer coating approach on the surface of a zeolitic imidazole framework. Subsequently, a series of hollow carbon capsules containing cobalt oxide and metallic cobalt were obtained by simple confined pyrolysis of the Zn/Co-ZIF@polymer (Fig. 5). The hollow capsules prevented clustering of the cobalt NPs, and porous shells achieved the highly efficient mass transfer. Moreover, the Co particle size and specific surface area were optimized by tuning the pristine Zn content in the ZIF particles, improving the overall catalytic activity. The yolk–shell structure of Zn4Co1Ox@carbon hollow capsules proved to be a highly selective and active catalyst (>99% selectivity) for the hydrogenation of nitrobenzene to aniline. Similarly, Pd&ZnO@carbon particles were successfully synthesized by wet chemical reduction to form Pd NPs on ZIF-8 nanoparticles, followed by a Stöber coating process to deposit a layer of aminophenol polymer on the surfaces of Pd/ZIF-8 nanoparticles, followed by successive processes such as hydrothermal treatment and carbonization. The obtained Pd&ZnO@polymer showed >99% selectivity for the hydrogenation of phenylacetylene to styrene, probably due to the void enrichment effect of the styrene, and the ZnO particles can be effective in facilitating the desorption of styrene and resist its over-hydrogenation.51

In summary, this method offers a facile route to the production of highly customisable porous materials with desired compositions and structure, but it is limited in that it usually requires high-temperature calcination and alkali etching or strong acid procedures to remove the templates. The metal core nanoparticles could be modified or damaged in the preparation process, thus preventing metal NPs with complicated compositions and morphologies from serving as cores. Notable metal–organic skeletons as a source of activity may not require the removal of a template, which provides guidance for customising MHCSs.
One-step in situ confinement strategies
A one-step in situ confinement strategy provides a simple strategy to synthesis carbon nanoreactor. The synthesized metal nanoparticles or soluble metal precursors are first mixed with the synthesis solution of carbon spheres, followed by high temperature carbonization process and reduction of the metal nanoparticles in the presence of reducing agents to form MHCSs.57–59 A range of HCSs with well-defined physicochemical properties have been prepared through the one-step in situ confinement strategy, as shown in Table 3. Chen et al.27 used sodium oleate (SO) and block copolymer (P123) as a soft template, 2,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid (DA) as the carbon source, melamine, dicyandiamide (DCDA), hexamethylenetetramine (HMT) or urea as the nitrogen source and RhCl3 as the nanoparticle precursor for the one-pot synthesis of a series of different metal nanoparticle sizes and nitrogen doped carbon spheres with different shell thicknesses. The carbon spheres synthesized with HMT as the dopant had smaller metal nanoparticle sizes and more uniform dispersion, resulting in 100% conversion of phenol and 99% yield of cyclohexanol. Kang et al.60 used a ligand-assisted polymerization strategy to prepare a unique atomic iron-dispersed nitrogen-doped mesoporous carbon (Fe–N–C) using dopamine as the carbon and nitrogen source and F127 (EO106PO70EO106) and TMB (1,3,5-trimethylbenzene) to modulate the pore structure. With an open honeycomb mesoporous structure and high surface area, Fe–N–C was able to maximize the exposure of highly reactive Fe–Nx sites and exhibited excellent chemical and structural stability toward the oxygen reduction process (Fig. 6). In conclusion, one-pot synthesis is a facile and scalable method for the construction of MHCSs, and the deposition of metal NPs outside or inside the HCS could be controlled using different metal precursors with different ligands, but this method is reported to be applicable to the fabrication of specific materials and lacks versatility in the fabrication of materials.59

Summary of MHCS synthesis strategies
The limited void space of the hollow carbon nanospheres could accommodate metal catalytic active sites, effectively inhibiting particle sintering and leaching and improving thermal stability and recovery. At the same time, as with the three strategies described above, the strong interactions between metal nanoparticles and encapsulated materials can be selectively manipulated during the synthesis process by modulating the physical structure and chemical composition to obtain the desired physicochemical microenvironment. However, significant challenges remain in preparing hollow carbon spheres with ideal physicochemical microenvironment (e.g., composition, cavity size, shell thickness, tunable mesopore size, and special structures) with a facile and controlled approach. Specifically, current synthetic methods still have some drawbacks, including the pre-synthesis and post-synthesis strategies involving cumbersome processing steps, which lead to high costs, long synthesis times and difficulty in scaling up. Although the one-pot approach is simple to operate, it is suitable for the preparation of specific materials and tends to emphasize the importance of the sequence of material addition. It is worth noting that the template-free method considerably simplifies the synthesis procedure and provides low costs and high product homogeneity. As no heterogeneous coating step is required, it can be easily scaled up, which is advantageous for practical applications. Bin et al.66 demonstrated that polymeric nanoparticles themselves could be a versatile platform for creating complex carbon structures. Specifically, the polymerization reaction between 3-aminophenol and formaldehyde was initiated with ammonia to form carbon spheres. Subsequently, a simple acetone etching of the collected particles was able to selectively remove the core of the particles while the outer shell retained its integrity to form hollow carbon spheres. The controlled growth kinetics of 3-aminophenol (3-AP)/formaldehyde (3-AF) resins form nanospheres with a homogeneous shape but complex internal chemistry. Moreover, the site-specific distribution of the different polymer components achieved within the 3-AF nanospheres allows them to be transformed into a variety of structures and precisely control different key features including cavities, pores, morphology and structure (Fig. 7). However, a generic template-free method that can be used to prepare hollow structures from a variety of materials is more difficult to achieve and still requires further research. Furthermore, for complex hollow structures such as multi-shells and different functional surfaces, an in-depth understanding of the hollowing mechanism is required to contribute to the optimization of the synthetic route through combinatorial approaches with optimized metal utilization and a well-defined physicochemical microenvironment, where the strengths of the single synthetic approach are combined as synergistically as possible. Wang et al.61 combined both one-step in situ confinement approach and post functionalization strategy in a final synthesis protocol to construct a hollow carbon matrix consisting of bimetallic NPs confined within hollow porous shells. The Pt@ hollow porous carbon was synthesized through chemical reduction of NPs and polymerization of dihydroxybenzoic acid (DA) and hexamethylenetetramine (HMT) under hydrothermal conditions. During the hydrothermal process, formaldehyde (generated from HMT) and DA polymerize on the surface of the emulsion droplets through weak acid–base interactions, resulting in the production of hollow carbon spheres with diameter and shell thickness easily tailored. The optimum molar ratio between P123 (EO20–PO70–EO20) and sodium oleate (SO) is 0.0075:0.24 in the synthesis system. Then, the materials were post-functionalized through the ion-exchange of Co2+ cations on the carboxylic groups of the polymer shells. Due to the homogeneous alloying and small size of PtCo NPs, the Pt–Co@HCS catalysts showed excellent catalytic performance for hydrogenolysis of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to 2,5-dimethylfuran (DMF), resulting in 100% conversion of DMF and 98% yield of HMF after 2 h.

Moreover, for loaded metal nanoparticles and metal compounds, precise management of the metal sizes, alloy compositions, shape and crystal form of metal NPs and the features of the encapsulating material is quite limited, which is essential for the design and optimization of catalysts.67,68 The size may impact the valence band structure and oxidation state of metal NPs, resulting in a different catalytic performance,32 which can be regulated by changing the amount of metal precursors, modulating metal–carrier interactions and preparing single atoms. Notably, the single-atom catalysts can reduce the cost of catalysis via maximizing the efficiency of atom utilization, offering more active sites via adjusting the geometry and electronic configuration.32,69 Zhang et al.70 encapsulated Au in amino-modified silica spheres, which showed excellent catalytic behavior and durability in high temperature carbon monoxide oxidation. Furthermore, the size of AuNPs was reduced from 2.3 nm to 1.5 nm by varying the number of metal precursors and showed high catalytic performance in catalytic oxidation reactions, reflecting the inherent size effect of Au nanoparticles on inert carriers. Chen et al. regulated the size and dispersion of NPs by using different nitrogen precursors. The optimized finely dispersed and ultra-small Rh NPs exhibited excellent catalytic activity in the efficient conversion of phenol to cyclohexanol under ambient conditions.27 The alloy compositions could cause intense synergistic effects between metal components and remarkably influence the catalytic performance.71 Li et al.71 fabricated a series of bimetallic Pd-M/HZSM-5 catalysts (M = Zr, Mn, Zn or La) for the controlled hydrodeoxygenation of bio-based ketones and aldehydes. In the hydrodeoxygenation of acetophenone, the prepared 0.5% Pd-2.0% Zr/HZSM-5 catalyst with a Pd/Zr mass ratio of 1:4 achieved high conversion (99%) and ethylbenzene selectivity (99%). The formation of a Pd–Zr alloy structure on the catalyst promoted the transformation of the Pd–O–Zr solid solution to PdO–ZrO2 and the creation of oxygen vacancies. In addition, the abundant oxygen vacancies on the alloyed Pd–Zr/HZSM-5 catalyst enhanced the dissociation of silane, thus providing abundant hydrogen protons and significantly accelerating the hydrogenation of bio-based aldehydes and ketones. The exposure of the crystal shape could greatly impact the interaction with the supports, which is important for the catalytic activity.72 Xin et al.72 pretreated activated carbon carriers to acid or alkali pretreatment to alter the distribution of oxidation groups on the carbon catalyst surface, which significantly affected the formation of nickel phosphide species. The Ni2P and Ni12P5 with a molar ratio of 1.0 were obtained on NH3·H2O pretreated carbon carriers, which displayed high hydrodeoxygenation activity towards palmitic acid. Thus, the hydrodeoxygenation activity of the carbon supported nickel phosphide catalysts was largely influenced by the crystalline phase of the nickel phosphide. Thus, the precise and independent control of these parameters is not only important to reveal their key influence on catalytic activity, but is also a prerequisite for optimizing metal catalysts for markedly enhanced practical applications. In summary, the oriented synthesis of MHCSs has a desirable physicochemical microenvironment and an excellent metallic state with various excellent confined microenvironment effects in practical applications.
Confined microenvironmental effects
The promising advantage of MHCS nanoreactors lies mainly in the hollow carbon nanostructure confined microenvironment, which is inherently highly systematically complex, involving various interactions between active metal nanoparticles, carbon substrates, and reactant molecules.73 In this section, we will discuss specific confined microenvironmental effects to improve understanding the advantages and characteristics of confinement catalysis, further contributing to the realization of targeted nanostructure engineering for MHCSs.
Mass transfer effect for selectivity enhancement: from carbon shells to site adsorption
For nanoreactor catalysis, reactants could enter by diffusion through the shell, interact with the catalyst active site; intermediates may be formed, which then convert to target products and leave the catalyst site.74,75 Throughout the reaction, low conversions occur once mass transfer of reactants or products is restricted, which may originate from the fact that the pore structure of the carbon carrier strongly determines the mass transfer behavior of the reaction molecules, intermediates and products in the confined microenvironment through the size selection function.76 Therefore, the catalytic selectivity could be well controlled via manipulating the pore structure parameters of the hollow carbon shells. Wang et al.59 described the preparation of yolk–shell structured Pd/C@HCS catalysts for selective hydrogenation reactions by one-pot hydrothermal synthesis and pyrolysis method. When Pd/C@HCS was used as the catalyst for the hydrogenation of nitrobenzene, the conversion was 100% after 30 min with an aminobenzene yield of 98%, whereas the conversion of 9-nitroanthracene over Pd/C@HCS was extremely low (<5%) even after reaction for 3 h. The different hydrogenation performance of Pd/C@HCS could be attributed to molecular sieving properties, where the conversion of 9-nitroanthracene is restricted by its transport through the porous carbon shell owing to the small micropore size of the shell or the strong adsorption of the anthracene blocking the pores in the carbon shell, whereas the small size of nitrobenzene could readily pass through the hollow carbon shell to access the metal active centers (Fig. 8). Zheng et al.77 reported a multi-coating route that allows for the facile formation of hollow carbon sphere (HCS) nanostructures with foam-like carbon shells (HCSF). The cationic surfactant cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) was shown to play a critical role in generating foam-like pores. In addition, the modified phenolic resin (RF) coating method provided sandwich-like SiO2@RF/CTAB@SiO2 precursors, and this structure conferred biaxial stretching during the subsequent carbonization procedure, producing well-developed foam-like pore structures. The prepared HCSF exhibited a richer pore volume (2.25 vs. 0.56 cm3 g−1) and higher surface area (1286 vs. 639 m2 g−1) by this multi-coating route compared to conventional HCS nanostructures. In this effective strategy, Au core-encapsulated nanoreactors (Au@HCSFs) with a yolk–shell structure were synthesized for the reduction of 4-nitrophenol to 4-aminophenol, achieving higher rate constants (0.085 vs. 0.065 min−1) than their Au@HCS counterparts, mainly due to the mesoporous nature of the HCSFs facilitating rapid diffusion of the reactants.

In addition, ultra-thin carbon shells also reduce mass transfer resistance and reduce the transport distance of charge carriers, thus further influencing the overall reaction rates. Fang's group78 developed a precisely customized resorcinol–formaldehyde resin coating method to fabricate Au@HCS hollow carbon catalysts with different carbon shell thicknesses for the reduction of 4-nitrophenol to 4-aminophenol. The reaction rate decreased linearly from 0.21 to 0.08 min−1 when the thickness of the shells was increased from 3 nm to 13 nm. This variation in the rate constant is thought to be largely attributed to the fact that thinner shells promote the diffusion of 4-nitrophenol into the inner chamber, while the thicker shells offered a greater mass transfer resistance, resulting in a reduced reaction rate. However, there is an increased potential risk of structural damage to the ultra-thin shell, which could lead to structural collapse and escape of the encapsulated metal particles, directly determining the validity of the MHCS nanoreactor reactivity experiments.79,80 Li et al.81 prepared a novel LaTiO2N hollow nanostructure with a thickness as small as 7 nm and a specific surface area as high as 275 m2 g−1 by ion absorption and templating methods. They found that an ultra-thin shell layer and a disordered surface layer could shorten the carrier diffusion distance to allow photogenerated carriers to reach the surface easily. However, it is not the case that the thinner the shell is, the better the performance is. The particle size should be well controlled to achieve optimal charge separation. Therefore, once full metal encapsulation has been established, the porosity and permeability of the carbon shells are also of concern, as they have a direct impact on the accessibility of the substrate molecules to the metal active sites or transport distance of charge carriers.
Apart from shape selectivity manifested through the porous size of the hollow carbon spheres and shell thickness affecting mass transfer and transport distance of charge carriers to modulate the catalytic performance, the adsorption behavior of the reactants on the catalyst sites also affects the catalytic activity and selectivity.82,83 The adsorption behavior (strength and structure) depends to a large extent on the characteristics of the active sites on the surface and the structure of the reacting species. A series of Ni–Fe bimetallic NPs loaded on hollow carbon spheres with different Ni/Fe ratios (Ni–Fe/MCSs) were applied to the generation of cyclohexane by the liquid-phase hydrodeoxygenation of phenol.84 More active centers for cyclohexanol adsorption were present on the Ni–Fe/MCSs than on their monometallic counterparts, and the highest cyclohexane yield of 93.8% was realized for the Ni/Fe ratio of 3/1. These findings show the importance of regulating the adsorption conformation of the intermediates, providing guidance for the modulation of the reaction pathway.
Void confinement effect for reactivity improvement: from adsorption to diffusion balance
The void confinement effect helps to create a unique nanoscale concentration microenvironment, which is the effective function for enhancing catalytic activity. The confinement effect typically causes the accumulation of reactant molecules, prolonging the duration of reactants and reaction intermediates on the catalyst surfaces and altering the hydrodynamics.85 Liu et al.63 reported the void confinement effect in managing the liquid-phase hydrogenation behavior of nanoreactors through well-designed comparative experiments using a pair of nanoreactors encapsulated internally and supported externally with PdCu NPs, respectively, as displayed in Fig. 9. The significantly improved performance was observed on the nanoreactors due to the void confinement effect speeding up the accumulation of reactants and extending the retention time of the intermediates. Additionally, it has been shown that multiple light scattering and reflection, enrichment of light and increased light absorption are achieved in the internal voids of the hollow structure. For example, a facile metal–organic framework-assisted synthesis method was employed for the construction of hierarchical double-shell hollow nanotubes for the photocatalytic reduction of CO2.86 The experimental results showed that the hierarchical double-shell hollow structures assembled from nanosheets utilize incident visible light by enhancing intracavity scattering, reducing the diffusion distance of photogenerated charges to sufficiently suppress electron and hole recombination and exposing abundant active sites for redox reactions. Benefiting from these advantages, the hollow nanotubes can catalyze the conversion of CO2 to CO in a photosensitive system under visible light irradiation with remarkable activity and high stability, yielding an excellent CO yield of 28.1 μmol h−1 (per 0.5 mg catalyst). The analogous enrichment phenomenon has been investigated in other hollow nanostructures, such as carbon nanofibers and carbon nanotubes.87

Note that in addition to enrichment phenomena driving the void confinement effect, diffusion phenomena and metal carrier interactions are closely related to the void confinement effect and there may be a complex interrelationship between them. Specifically, reactant enrichment and diffusion phenomena are important manifestations of the void confinement effect in the microenvironment of nanoreactors, which are usually closely related to cavity curvature. Ma et al.88 prepared a series of hollow spheres (NAHS) assembled from copper silicate nanotubes with different cavity curvatures for the catalytic hydrogenation of dimethyl oxalate. They found that as the size of the hollow sphere increases, the apparent reaction rate rises at low hollow sphere sizes, reaching a maximum at 211 nm, and then decreases with further increase in size. This volcano-like catalytic performance is owing to the antagonistic behavior between the reactant enrichment effect and diffusion flux inside the hollow carbon spheres, which could help to optimize the curvature of the hollow structures (Fig. 10). Furthermore, changes in curvature can have a significant effect on electron transfer between the metal nanoparticles and carbon carriers. Specifically, the stress change in the curved carbon shell deviates the graphene layer from planarity, resulting in a shift of π-electron density from the inner surface (concave) to the outer surface (convex), which accordingly leads to electron deficient and electron rich states in the inner and outer locations, respectively.89,90 Due to these changes in the electron microenvironment, the internally loaded metal nanoparticles will supply more electrons to the relatively electron-rich carbon surfaces than the externally loaded nanoparticles. The adsorption characteristics of metal nanoparticles with different electron densities depend heavily on the electronic behavior of the substrate and as a result affect the reaction performance of the catalyst.91

In order to explain constraint relationship between factors influencing the void confinement effect, Yu et al.92 prepared nanoreactors with similar structures, i.e. Ru particles encapsulated inside the carbon shell (Ru@HCSs) and Ru particles implanted outside the carbon shell (Ru/HCSs) using the hard template method for the hydrogenation of levulinic acid (LA) with electron-absorbing carbonyl groups (Fig. 11a). The diameter of the silica spheres could be perfectly controlled with adjustments of the ammonia addition to obtain nanoreactors with different curvatures, i.e. small curvature Ru@HCSs-s, medium curvature Ru@HCSs-m and large curvature Ru/HCSs-l (Fig. 11b–k). The potential mechanism for the formation of void confined effects was confirmed by repeated experiments (Fig. 11l–o). As indicated in Fig. 11m (point a), Ru@HCSs-m exhibited a relatively optimized local reactant concentration owing to its relatively suitable architectural parameters, while Ru@HCSs-l and Ru@HCSs-s encountered limited diffusion (point c) and limited adsorption (point b), respectively, causing relatively reduced overall reactant concentrations. On the other hand, the electronic metal–support interaction would be enhanced with increasing curvature, resulting in a more pronounced electron deficient state (points d and e). During the antagonistic process, Ru@HCSs-m exhibited excellent catalytic properties due to its advantage in efficiently concentrating reactants (point f). In contrast, for other nanoreactors with non-optimal internal reactant concentrations, the electronic metal–support interaction could play a non-negligible role in terms of determining the overall catalytic activity, which may account for the difference in performance between Ru@HCSs-l and Ru@HCSs-s (points g and h).

In summary, void confinement effects are essentially a combination of effects involving both electronic metal–support interaction, reactant enrichment and diffusion, and reactant concentration appears to play a more important role than metal electron–carrier interactions in contributing to the void confinement effect. In order to accurately assess the intrinsic catalytic mechanism of MHCS nanoreactors, as well as to target the electronic interfacial structure between metal nanoparticles, quantitative exploration of void confinement effects and modulation of carbon matrices to improve electronic metal–support interaction is still required.
Spatial compartmentation effect for multifunctional optimization: from dual sites to cascade reactions
It is commendable that attractive space-separation features can be implemented for a wider range of catalytic applications on a variety of cascade reactions, showing great potential in substituting redundant operations and cost-intensive, including concentration, purification and separation of the intermediates.93–95 Through the clever design of several critical nano-structural factors such as layer shells, metal sites, and pore structures, reactant molecules could be targeted to a specific location in the MHCS nanoreactors, promoting the rapid transformation of in situ generated intermediates, curbing the formation of by-products and improving the selectivity of the desired product. Ideally, the entire kinetic process might be precisely controlled, although it depends to a large extent on quite rational pre-excitation, and a series of finely engineered approaches to catalysis in developing the process.96
The spatial compartmentation effect provides the versatility necessary for tandem reactions, which are often mediated through the synergistic action of different reaction active site centers. Immobilization of Pd NPs within triazinyl g-C3N4 nanotubes (NTs) resulted in a novel bifunctional catalyst that was used as an outstanding catalyst for the Knoevenagel condensation–reduction cascade reaction. The amines and Pd nanoparticles were alternately accountable for the Knoevenagel condensation and consequent reduction cascade procedures to produce benzylmalononitrile. These structural factors afforded the Pd/triazine-based gC3N4 NTs excellent catalytic activity in the tandem reactions, resulting in 100% conversion of benzaldehyde and 99.2% selectivity for the target product benzylmalononitrile, attributed to the high base amount (especially the –NH and –NH2 groups) and the presence of enhanced interactions between Pd particles and nitrogen atoms.97 The double-shell hollow mesoporous silica was designed by a two-step condensation method, introducing an acidic skeletal worked Al species in the inner shell and tethering the amino bolus to the carbon shell. As shown in Fig. 12, the double-shell structure achieves spatial separation of the acid and base positions, and the mesopores in the shell facilitate mass transfer within the hollow. This double-shell hollow material has been shown to be highly active, stable and selective for the deacetylated Knoevenagel cascade reactions, resulting in approximately 100% conversion of benzaldehyde dimethyl acetal and about 100% selectivity for the desired product benzyl cyanoacetate, largely due to the spatially isolated acidic and basic sites, and the mesopores and voids within the carbon shells that facilitate mass transfer rates.98 The multishell structure provided inspiration for the design of catalysts with spatially compartmentalized active centers, allowing for smoother cascade reactions.

Janus nanoparticles could integrate different functional characteristics, which produce more synergistic effects, and are a typical way to construct spatially separated MHCS nanoreactors.99–101 The multifunctional amphiphilic nanoreactors consisting of Janus nitrogen-doped C@SiO2 hollow nanostructures and ultra-small Pt NPs are reported.37 The internal polybenzoxazine decomposes from the inside to the outside, transforming into N-doped carbon hollow shells, partially embedded in the mesosilicate layer, creating Janus hollow carbon spheres. The superior hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity enhanced both the adsorption of hydrophobic alcohols in water and the desorption of water molecules as the by-product from the active site, successfully demonstrating a one-pot oxidation–condensation cascade reaction with the synthesis of imines from alcohols and amines in good yields. These Janus nanoparticles with adjustable hydrophilic/hydrophobic compartments and selective functionalization are highly scalable and have significant potential to become an excellent multifunctional catalyst for cascade reactions. A facile method was invented to construct Janus surfaces by loading and encapsulating Co3O4 and Pt particles on the outer and inner surfaces of hollow carbon nitride spheres (HCNSs), respectively, to enhance redox functionality. The specific synthetic roadmap of this Janus HCNS photocatalyst is shown in Fig. 13. Such a multifunctional surface spatially endowed the HCNS nanostructure with separated reduction and oxidation centers, and the HCNS nanostructure was found to display enhanced photooxidation activity in terms of water separation. This enhanced performance is thought to be due to the unidirectional migration of electrons and holes across the Janus nanostructure, which can inhibit undesired reverse reactions and further inhibit the charge recombination.9

Metal size effect for performance enhancement: from the nanoscale to the atomic sites
The catalytic activity of metal catalysts is heavily dependent on the metal shape and size.102–105 Reducing the size of metal particles leads to an increase in the proportion of low-coordinated surface atoms at locations such as edges and corners.106–108 Thus, the increase in unsaturated metal surface atoms, the increase in metal surface free energy, and the increasing number of metal-to-metal carrier interactions also become active.109 Ivanova's group prepared a series of 4–40 nm gold nanoparticles, immobilized them on activated carbon and tested the catalytic oxidation of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) at low alkali concentrations.110 The variations in gold particle size has a large effect on carbon balance and product selectivity, and the behavior is attributed to thermodynamically beneficial oxygen reduction reactions on Au(100) faces. As the gold nanoparticle size decreases, both the Au(100)/Au(111) exposure ratio and the selectivity of FDCA would increase, which are dependent on the gold particle size. The smaller the gold nanoparticle size, the smaller the ratio of 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furancarboxylic acid (HMFCA) to FDCA, suggesting that the size of gold largely affects the oxidation of the alcohol function of the HMF molecules. Zhu et al.111 prepared a variety of Ni/SiO2 catalysts with different nickel particle sizes (2–22 nm) and investigated the relationships between metal NPs sizes and m-cresol hydrodeoxygenation (HDO). Varying Ni particle size is expected to alter the fraction of step, terrace, and corner site on the Ni particle surface, which may in turn affect the HDO activity (Fig. 14a and b). When the size of the Ni NP was reduced from 22 nm to 2 nm, the turnover frequencies for methylcyclohexanone/methylcyclohexanol and toluene formation were increased by a factor of 4 and 6 respectively, while the turnover frequency for CH4 formation was reduced by a factor of 3/4 (Fig. 14c). These results suggested that defect sites (corner, step) are more favourable for deoxygenation while terrace site are more favourable for C–C hydrogenolysis. The decreasing the Ni NP sizes increases the defect sites, thereby improving the selective deoxygenation of toluene while inhibiting the generation of unwanted CH4 by C–C hydrogenolysis, and that adjusting the metal grain sizes is an effective way to manipulate the reaction during hydrodeoxygenation.

When the metals are downsized into the single atom level, the resulting materials with single-atomic-site realize the ultimate atom utilization efficiency and have adjustable geometric and electronic configurations to provide more active catalytic sites, which typically increases their catalytic activity.112,113 However, due to the highly unsaturated coordination of single atoms, which tend to agglomerate and migrate in the catalytic process, the choice of support and stabilization of single-atom catalysts is highly significant. The high specific surface areas and remarkable permeability make hollow carbon nanomaterials ideal carriers for the immobilization of isolated single atomic sites.114 Li et al. reported a novel polymer encapsulation strategy to fabricate metal isolated-single-atomic-site metal catalysts (ISAS) dispersed in N-doped nanospheres through coordination effects with the N atoms of carbon carriers to stabilize the isolated metal atoms,115 as shown in Fig. 15a–d. The metal was present in the form of ISASs with positive charges and that the metal atoms were coordinated to four N atoms from the nanosphere carrier (Fig. 15e and f). The Co-ISAS/p-CN nanospheres showed excellent electrochemical oxygen reduction activity comparable to 20 wt% loading of Pt/C in alkaline media, and the superior methanol tolerance, opening a novel way avenue to obtain metal ISAS catalysts with excellent performance. Similarly, Zhao et al.116 reported an intercalated structure of hollow carbon nitride spheres (HCNS) composed of carbon nitride nanosheets with atomically dispersed Cu1N3 moieties embedded in the nanosheets (Cu1N3@HCNS). The modified HCNS with Cu1N3 moieties immobilized on the surface of the nanosheets for photo-redox catalysis displayed far superior performance to pristine HCNS, where the embedded single-atom Cu served as the modulator to significantly regulate the electronic structure and promote interfacial charge transfer of polymeric carbon nitride.

Surface modification effect for active improvement: from functional groups to defect sites
MHCS nanoreactors with modifiable surfaces are expected to provide functional groups, specific electronic structures, enhanced substrate interactions and regulating reaction pathways for catalytic processes, significantly affecting the catalytic activity, selectivity, and stability. Modulation of the chemical composition of nanoreactors represents a simple and effective strategy for selective regulation of catalysis.

Heteroatom doping engineering. 
Heteroatom doping engineering is a worthy method to alter the chemical composition of the carrier surface by incorporating diverse heteroatoms (N, F, S, B, P) into the carbon matrix.117–120 Heteroatoms can be introduced by pyrolysis of heteroatom-rich polymers as precursors or by subjecting preformed carbons matrix to post-synthetic treatment with heteroatom-containing precursors.117,121 These heteroatoms alter the electronic structure, increase the selective adsorption of reactants, enhance metal and carrier interactions, increase the structural defects of the support and are expected to tune the reaction path, contributing to the increased activity of the catalyst.122–124 The catalytic activity and product selectivity in various catalytic reactions due to the heteroatom doping engineering of carbon-based catalysts is illustrated in Table 4. Liu et al.125 fabricated a two-site separated nanoreactor for the hydrogenation of levulinic acid (LA) in water consisting of double-shelled hollow carbon spheres (DSC) supported by a precise distribution of nitrogen in the outer shell, while ultrafine Ru nanoparticles were encapsulated in a hollow sandwich (Fig. 16a). The nitrogen-doped external hollow carbon shells were formed from either resorcinol–formaldehyde resin (RF), chitosan (CTS) or 3-aminophenol–formaldehyde resin (APF) to produce Ru-DSC-RF, Ru-DSC-CTS, and Ru-DSC-APF, respectively. The Ru-DSC-CTS (using chitosan as a precursor) had the highest pyridinic N content and the abundant pyridinic nitrogen modulates the catalyst microenvironment to basic, with the basic pyridinic nitrogen species acting as an anchor for the acidic reactants due to spontaneous acid–base interactions (Fig. 16b). The Ru-DSC-CTS achieved 99% conversion of levulinic acid after 1 h of reaction at 70 °C and 4 MPa hydrogen pressure. This work demonstrated a proof of concept that N doping not only enhances the catalytic activity of metal NPs but also creates interactions between the reactants and nitrogen species. The MOF-derived Cu2O/Cu nanospheres (Cu2O/Cu@NC-800) anchored in hollow porous carbon frameworks with different characteristics and nitrogen doping contents were synthesized by varying the carbonization temperature.126 When carbonized at 800 °C, the prepared catalyst (Cu2O/Cu@NC-800) showed a significant increase in activity, selectivity and durability in the electrochemical conversion of CO2 to formate, depending on the good dispersion of metal nanoparticles in the nitrogen-doped carbon framework and the formation of more low-index facets, providing a wealth of reaction sites for CO2 adsorption and activation. Meanwhile, the doping of N in the Cu2O lattice promoted the formation of formate by changing the electronic structure of Cu2O and lowering the binding energy of *OCHO. Moreover, heteroatom doping is expected to modulate the reaction path by manipulating the selective adsorption of intermediates. Bao et al.127 demonstrated that nitrogen-doped CNTs as carriers, the loaded Pd particles could obtain superior benzyl alcohol selectivity from the hydrogenation of benzaldehyde than the Pd NPs loaded with CNTs modified with oxygen functional groups and bare CNTs. Indeed, the benzyl alcohol intermediate could be easily further hydrogenated in such a sequential hydrogenation process, and the N-doping engineering driving the weakened adsorption of the benzyl alcohol on the active centers is responsible for this effective selectivity control, which significantly inhibits over-hydrogenation. This carbon carrier functionalization strategy provides valuable inspiration for exploitation of a controlled microenvironment for MHCSs, which also holds promise for regulating product distribution in continuous reactions. In addition, some synergistic measures to modulate the adsorption of specific intermediates through carbon matrix functionalization, and the optimization of carbon material nanostructure parameters influencing the mass transfer rate, are also work worth investigating in order to realize the desired product distribution. The recent discovery of heteroatom doping components as active sites could provide a vast opportunity for the rational design and synthesis of novel metal-free catalysts for challenging chemical applications. Luo et al.128 prepared N-assembly carbons (NACs) with closely placed nitrogen sites via condensing carbon tetrachloride and ethylenediamine (EDA). The NACs showed high selectivity for alkylarenes in the hydrogenolysis of aryl ethers without over-hydrogenation of arenes, with activity arising from diamine precursor-induced cooperative graphitic nitrogen dopants. As demonstrated in computational studies and mechanistic investigations, NAC catalysts are multifunctional for dehydrogenation of tetrahydroquinoline and ethylbenzene as well as the hydrogenation of common unsaturated functionalities, such as alkynes, alkenes, nitro groups and ketone. The discovery of a nitrogen assembly as active sites could provide a vast opportunity for rational design and synthesis of novel metal-free catalysts, which could also help in the construction of catalysts with spatial compartmentation capabilities.

Apart from the doping of individual atomic species which affects the catalytic activity, co-doping involves the doping of different species of heteroatoms in the carbon matrix, which could result in the synergy effect to show excellent catalytic activity. Metal-free electrocatalysts of N, S co-doped hierarchical porous carbon (NSHPC) were prepared for the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2 RR) via pyrolysis of thiocyanuric acid and glucosamine hydrochloride. The N,P co-doping could effectively decrease the Gibbs free energy of the crucial intermediates and improve the maximum spin density on carbon to enhance intrinsic activity, which reduced CO2 to CO with a maximum Faraday efficiency (FE) of 87.8% in an aqueous electrolyte.129 Porous N, P co-doped carbon coated ultrafine Co2P NPs (Co2P@NPC) were synthesized by simple freeze-drying accompanied by one-step pyrolysis using deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). DNA was a phosphorus source for metal phosphorylation and an excellent N,P co-doped carbon matrix to support highly dispersed nanoparticles. The N,P co-doped carbon shells could improve the electrical conductivity of electrodes and enhance the electrocatalytic performance towards hydrogen precipitation reactions.130 Li et al.131 proposed N and S double-doped hollow carbon materials (SZ-HCN) as catalysts for the electrochemical reduction of CO2. The SZ-HCN showed outstanding catalytic properties for the reduction of CO2 to CO at 0.6 V, with a high CO faradaic efficiency (∼93%) and significant electrocatalytic durability. The experimental results and density functional theory calculations indicate that the N and S double-doped carbon materials provide more active sites and require lower Gibbs free energy for the formation of COOH* intermediates compared to the single N-doped carbon, resulting in improved electrocatalytic reduction activity (Fig. 17). The co-doping shows existing synergistic benefits to enhance catalytic reactions, but co-doping in carbon-based catalysts has been less studied than single heteroatom doping due to its complexity, and the detailed interaction mechanisms, doping ratios, and doping configurations are not yet fully understood.

Additionally, for single atom doping or co-doping projects the atomic doping content, appropriate atom configuration, concentration as well as position could play an important role in the catalytic activity. Yu's group132 found that CNTs doped with heteroatomic nitrogen and sulphur atoms can be used as carbon matrices to obtain ruthenium NPs with adjustable electronic structures for the hydrogenation of levulinic acid. The electronic state of the surface ruthenium particles can be readily modified by adjusting the amount of nitrogen, thus changing the interaction between the carbon substrate and ruthenium particles. Under the optimized conditions, the electron-rich Ru catalysts greatly facilitated the hydrogenation of levulinic acid to γ-valerolactone with TOF values up to 2096 h−1. Therefore, precise modulation of atomic doping content, appropriate doping configurations as well as positions is essential to probe their key effects on catalytic activity for improved use in practical applications.
In conclusion, heteroatom doping engineering facilitates the formation of metal nanoparticles with adjustable electronic states, improves the dispersion of metal nanoparticles to a higher degree, increases metal and carrier interactions, regulates acidity and alkalinity, etc. In addition, it could serve as an active site for metal-free catalysis, offering the possibility of constructing cascade catalysts. Intriguingly, such engineering could operate on the selective adsorption of reactant molecules, which largely helps to regulate the product distribution of various cascade reactions. However, the control of doping configurations, positions and ratios for practical catalytic applications and their potential prospects are not yet been concretely demonstrated, as the relevant research is still in its infancy and further studies are still needed.


Surface functionalization engineering. 
Surface modification is essential to graft functional groups on carbon materials to improve the application performance of catalytically active species. Various methods, including oxidation, sulfonation, and halogenation, are commonly used for functional group modification of the carbon matrix (Table 5).142 For example, oxygen functional groups such as –COOH, –OH, –OCO and –CO are excellent means for oxidative introduction into the carbon matrix using chemical reagents such as HNO3, KOH, K2MnO4, H2SO4, H2O2, etc.143,144 The presence of oxygen functional groups could improve the dispersion of the carbon carrier in the solvents and allow the metal active phase to be robustly immobilized on the surface of the carbon materials as well as easier accessibility of the reactants to the active phase.145–147 Wang et al.153 discovered that CNTs amended with concentrated nitric acid for the hydrodeoxygenation of vanillin showed superior catalytic activity, with 100% vanillin conversion and >98% selectivity for 2-methoxy-4-methylphenol (MMP). First, vanillyl alcohol readily interacts with the carboxyl groups, releasing water and forming the appropriate free radical, and then hydrogen atoms decomposing on the Pd NPs react rapidly with the radicals to produce MMP. Herrera et al.148 discovered that the catalytic performance of CNTs oxidized with nitric acid was better than that of the unmodified CNTs in the catalytic hydrogenation of furfural. This was attributed to the increase in oxygen functional groups on the carbon surfaces, allowing the creation of amphiphilic nanoparticles that were evenly distributed at the oil–water interface of the emulsified droplets, further increasing the catalytic performance of the furfural hydrogenation. Guaiacol HDO was investigated by Dongil et al.149 using concentrated nitric acid wet oxidation of carbon nanotubes (Ni/CNTox) and heat-treated activated carbon (Ni/AC). They found that the difference in product distribution on Ni/AC and Ni/CNT catalysts may be attributed to the accessibility to the active centers that control the different hydrogenation capacities of the catalysts. The presence of oxygen groups on the Ni/CNTox catalysts can reduce the activity of the Ni centers by hindering the adsorption or migration of guaiacol to active centers, and the acid sites on the Ni/CNTox catalysts impeded the hydrogenation pathway while promoting the demethoxylation pathway. In addition, the successful sulfonation of carbon materials is usually reflected in changes in surface acidity, hydrophilicity and thermal properties.150,151 A solid acid catalyst consisting of a flexible carbon framework containing SO3H groups has been synthesized by the sulphonation of biochar derived from vegetable oil pitch.152 It showed high catalytic activity for the production biodiesel from inexpensive raw feedstocks with high concentration free fatty acids, which reached 94.8% conversion of free fatty acids in 4.5 hours. Such high catalytic activity can be attributed to its high acid strength (2.21 mmol g−1), the hydrophobic nature of the carbon sheet, which prevents the hydration of the –OH species and the hydrophilic functional groups that improve the contact of methanol with FFA and triglycerides. Surface functionalization engineering of MHCSs provides a versatile functionalization strategy for the rational design of well-defined and efficient nanocatalysts to target complex catalytic reactions.

Defect engineering. 
Defect engineering is a particularly important and powerful tactic for improving catalytic performance by modifying the electronic states of the catalysts, facilitating substrate molecules adsorption, acting as direct reaction sites and influencing hydrogen spillover.158–160 As an intriguing direction for the construction of catalyst microstructures, defects are promising in playing a significant role in electrocatalysis, photocatalysis and thermal catalysis.
Defects can act as a direct reaction site and modulate the electronic state of the surrounding atoms, potentially affecting the adsorption energy of substrate molecules, leading to variations in the kinetics and selectivity of the catalytic reactions. A sequence of bimetallic CoNi catalysts were fabricated for the hydrodeoxygenation of lignin-derived vanillin to produce methylcyclohexanol (MCYL).161 The bimetallic CoNi nanocatalysts showed excellent catalytic HDO activity, with MCYL yields approaching 100% and turnover frequency up to 1303 h−1 under mild reaction conditions. In the catalytic process involving vanillin, the oxygen vacancies on the CoNi nanoparticle surface could initially coordinate with the oxygen atoms in the aldehyde groups, which can lengthen and weaken the CO double bond. The reactive hydrogen species could suitably attack the attenuated CO double bond, so direct deoxidation reactions of carbonyl groups could rapidly proceed to create 2-methoxy-4-methylphenol intermediates. At the same time, a pathway for Meerwein–Ponndorf–Verley (MPV) reduction process may occur during HDO. Subsequently, the Co atom adjoining the oxygen defects could associate with the carbon atoms attached to the methoxy group, weakening the O–C ring bond in 2-methoxy-4-methylphenol. In addition, the surface electron-rich Co0 species on the CoNi nanoparticles can associate with oxygen atoms in the methoxy, facilitating the deoxygenation reactions. Subsequently, the 2-methoxy-4-methylphenol undergoes cleavage through the O–C ring bond to generate 4-methylphenol. Finally, the benzene ring adsorbed on the metal site under the planar condition could be readily hydrogenated to yield MCYL. Liu et al. designed carbon nitride based catalysts (CN@VS-CIS) with a hollow heterojunction structure and sulphur vacancies (gC3N4@S defective CuIn5S8 hollow structure) using silica template by the hydrothermal method to enhance the activity of visible light photocatalysts for CO2 reduction. The introduction of sulphur vacancies effectively traps charge carriers arriving at the surface, with more photoelectron conversion, effectively improving the separation of electron–hole pairs. At the same time, the electron-donating nature of the localized electrons around the defect can activate the inert absorber molecule, thus exhibiting significant photocatalytic properties162 (Fig. 18). Cheng et al.163 presented the fabrication of core–shell CdS nanoparticles by the template methodology, where nanoparticles with controlled sulphur vacancies are encapsulated in a carbon–nitrogen-coated hollow structure. The experimental results showed that samples treated at 500 °C (CdS/NCP-500) exhibited a high conversion of 3052 nmol h−1 cm−2 with a selectivity of 77.3% for the methanol products. DFT theory showed that the high calcination temperature of 500 °C favored the formation of sulphur vacancies in the electrocatalyst and a high amount of pyridine N. The NCP with high pyridinic N content facilitated the conversion of COOH* to CO* (ΔE = −3.6 eV), which is then transferred to the CdS surface with enriched sulphur vacancies and further reduced to methanol products. It has been shown that the presence of sulphur vacancies considerably decreases the energy barrier for the reduction of CO2, which is favorable for the formation of hydrocarbons such as formic acid.

Moreover, defects could anchor metal active nanoparticles or groups or some atoms to form new reaction active sites and reduce the energy of reaction systems.158 The new active centers could have superior catalytic properties to other non-defective anchor sites due to the electronic interactions between the defect sites and the metal active component.164 Fang's group165 loaded defects and heteroatoms onto a modified activated carbon carrier of non-precious nickel (Ni/N, P-ACS) by adding N and P atoms and varying the calcination temperature. The N, P-ACS-900 catalyst that were constructed at the calcination temperature of 900 °C was used for the liquid phase hydrogenation of 1,5-dinitronaphthalene with a yield of 95.8% for 1,5-diaminonaphthalene. The nitrogen species was burnt off at 900 °C, leading to more defect sites on the carbon supports, and the loaded Ni-based catalysts displayed relatively lower ID/IG values than N, P-ACS-900, which may be attributed to the preference of the NPs to anchor at the location of structural defects on the surface of catalysts. The presence of defects provides additional anchoring sites for Ni loading and growth, promoting interaction between the support and the metallic Ni. The combination of phosphorus species and defects facilitates the adsorption and dissociation of H2. A defective zeolite-carbon (CFR@HZSM-5) nanocomposite supported nanoscale Pd catalyst (Pd/CFR@HZSM-5) was cleverly prepared for the selective ‘hydrogen-free’ oxygenation (HDO) reaction of vanillin (VL) to MMP under mild conditions166 (Fig. 19a–e). The optimized Pd/CFR@HZSM-5 catalysts showed excellent activity (99% yield for MMP) with a high TOF of 3983.0 h−1 in polymethylsiloxane at 60 °C. The CFR@HZSM-5 nanocomposite had a surface rich in carbon defect structures that could offer distinctive sites for the capture of Pd NPs and act as active sites to facilitate the adsorption of reactant molecules (Fig. 19f). This approach opens up new ways for relational design catalysts with high efficiency and activity for the selective conversion of biomass under mild and green conditions.

In conclusion, defect engineering is an effective and important means of improving the selectivity of a desired product, regulating the electronic structures and reactant adsorption energy of catalysts, and anchoring metals and atoms. Defects can also be used directly as reaction sites, which points the direction for the rational design and construction of MHCSs, but this field of study has not been extensively explored. Notably, defects can affect hydrogen spillover directly regulating reaction efficiency. Hydrogen spillover from the metal particles to the surface of the defect-free carbon carrier is energetically unfavorable, but spillover onto the defective or carbon carrier is possible.164,167 At present, understanding of spillover systems is still lacking and in situ characterization techniques require to be developed rapidly. Based on the above functions, the fabrication of defects in carbon-based materials has guided the way to enhance the catalyst performance in various fields. However, owing to the intricacy of the defects in carbon based carriers, it is presently challenging to quantify the exact concentration distribution, type and concentration of defects fabricated, which could have a considerable impact on the performance of the catalyst.168 Thus, the development of constructible defect synthesis methods also requires clarification of the location, the types as well as the number of defects. Furthermore, the surface defect sites are likely to be changing constantly in the catalytic phase instead of remaining constant, which could induce the surface reconfiguration of the catalyst to form catalytically active sites with high stability and activity.169,170 There is still a requirement to develop in situ characterization techniques to accurately track the actual catalytic reaction procedure and the active site changes, and to investigate the effects of the dynamic development of surface defects during catalysis.

MHCS application towards biomass upgradation
As a natural renewable resource, biomass is attracting widespread attention in recent years as it can be efficiently converted into various fuels and chemicals and promises to be an effective solution for the current energy scarcity and environmental degradation problems.171–173 For example, rich lignocellulosic biomass derivatives could be depolymerized into various aromatic molecule species (e.g. propyl eugenol, phenol, vanillic acid, eugenol, cresol, guaiacol, anisole), which can be upgraded through catalytic conversion processes including hydrodeoxygenation, hydrogenation, coupling reactions, etc., the resulting upgraded products could be used as basic constituents of petroleum-like chemicals and fuels (e.g. phenol, xylene, toluene and benzene).10,174,175 Due to the promising commercial potential and value-added applications for these biomass-derived molecules, an enhanced amount of research efforts have been devoted to designing novel multifunctional catalysts for enhancing the performance of metal-catalyzed biomass upgradation, with MHCSs receiving increasing research attention. In this section, representative biomass-derived molecules are used as examples to further illustrate the potential benefits of MHCS nanoreactors for biomass upgrading applications.
Hydrogenation reaction
Selective hydrogenation reactions of olefines (–CC–) as well as aldehydes and ketones (–CO) are typical types of reactions during the biomass refining process.176 In the hydrogenation process, hydrogen is supplied directly as H2 or by transfer among other H-donor molecules such as ethanol, methanol, and formic acid, which usually involve high temperature and pressure reaction conditions.177–180 Finding efficient catalysts to allow the reaction to proceed under mild conditions is still challenging. MHCSs have been reported to exhibit unique catalytic characteristics in terms of activity and stability in the hydrogenation of biomass-derived platform molecules compared to other activated carbon materials for conventional applications due to their confinement effect conferred by their favorable hollow structural characteristics. Lopez-Sanchez et al. investigated the hydrogenation activity of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural on Ru NPs supported on multi-walled carbon nanotubes (Ru/MWCNTs), which were fabricated via a wetness impregnation approach.181 Under the conditions of 2 MPa H2 and 150 °C, 5-hydroxymethylfurfural achieved complete conversion in only 1 h, resulting in a TOF value up to 819.7 h−1 in dimethylfuran, whereas the same approach could only yield a relatively low TOF value of 36 h−1 for Ru NPs supported on activated carbon particles (Ru/AC) under the same conditions. The enhanced performance of Ru/MWCNTs has been confirmed to be due to the excellent porosity of multi-walled carbon nanotubes and the electron promotion effect in the hollow confined microenvironment. Wang et al.182 used hollow carbon spheres as carriers and used vacuum impregnation to load the active metal Ni on the inside of the hollow carbon spheres to obtain a hollow carbon sphere-encapsulated Ni catalyst (Ni@HCS), which was applied to the aqueous phase hydrogenation and rearrangement reaction of furfural (FAL). It was found that Ni@HCS exhibited excellent performance in the reaction, achieving complete conversion of FAL at 150 °C, 2 MPa hydrogen pressure and 4 h and 99.1% cyclopentanone selectivity. Compared to the activated carbon loaded catalyst, the Ni@HCS catalyst exhibited excellent aqueous phase stability in the reaction, maintaining high activity after 10 cycles and the hollow carbon spheres provide protection to the active metal, which significantly reduced the loss of metal during the reaction. Therefore, compared to other conventionally used activated carbon-based catalysts, the hollow carbon nanostructure shows excellent hydrogenation reactivity owing to its advantageous hollow structural features.
Apart from the inherent characteristics of hollow carbon structures, chemically modifiable hollow carbon carriers are used to encapsulate metal active NPs with manipulation of the interaction between the support and metal, showing potential in improving the catalytic performance of MHCS nanoreactors. Yu et al.123 found that Ru particles with adjustable electronic structures can be attained via using nitrogen atom-doped carbon nanotubes as carbon matrices for the hydrogenation of levulinic acid. The N@CNTs provided electrons to produce more electron-rich Ru0 species and via adjusting the quantity of N, the electronic state of the surface Ru nanoparticles can be changed, resulting in differential interactions between the carbon matrix and Ru nanoparticles. The electron-rich Ru catalysts remarkably facilitated the hydrogenation of levulinic acid to γ-valerolactone with high TOF values of 2096 h−1 under optimized conditions. Theoretical models of RuO2(110) and Ru(0001) were established to further model Ru0 species with electron-deficient and electron-rich states to further explain this electronic promoting effect. The adsorption energy of levulinic acid (−2.79 eV) on RuO2(110) was −2.79 eV less than that on Ru(0001) at −1.58 eV. However, the energy barrier of 3.15 eV to be overridden in the rupture of R–COOH to create R–CO and –OH is much higher for RuO2(110) than for Ru(0001) (0.90 eV), while the difference in activation energy found in the subsequent closed-loop step is negligible. These results suggest that the electron promotion can be attributed to the ability of the electron-rich Ru0 to considerably decrease the activation energy of R–COOH rupture. Li et al.136 fabricated N-doped carbon-loaded cobalt catalysts (Co@C–N) via direct pyrolysis of the N-containing cobalt based MOF for transfer hydrogenation of 2-methylbenzonitrile. Strongly basic sites were present in the prepared Co@C–N samples, which may play a role similar to that of a base additive in absorbing isopropanol and accelerating transfer of hydrogen to Co nanoparticles, thereby facilitating the transfer hydrogenation reactions. This study presents guidance to perform a range of in situ hydrogen source assisted hydrogenation reactions of biomass. Liu's group used 3-aminophenol as the nitrogen precursor for the in situ construction of highly monodisperse hollow carbon spheres, coated with Ru metal in a nanoreactor for the hydrogenation of levulinic acid.122 The Ru/N-CS catalyst prepared at an optimized carbonization temperature of 850 °C displayed superior catalytic activity, with 9858 h−1 turnover frequency and 51% yield of γ-valerolactone, which may be attributed to the quaternary N enrichment could improve the dispersion and anchoring of Ru nanoparticles, significantly improving levulinic acid conversion (Fig. 20).

In addition to the above applications where metal and carrier interactions are used to modulate catalytic selectivity and activity, MHCSs have been used to facilitate the cascade reaction of a number of biomass-derived molecules via the mutual cooperation between metal sites and acidic moieties, and to inhibit the formation of coke, which is produced by high temperatures and strong acidic sites, as well as the low overall efficiency induced by the multitude of intermediates and reaction procedures.82,96,183 Recently, Zhang et al.184 designed and fabricated dual active site Co@C core–shell nanoparticles to facilitate the selective hydrogenation of various N-heteroarenes. Combining various techniques such as kinetic analysis and DFT calculations, it is directly revealed that the key multi-porous structure carbon shells with pore sizes of 0.53 nm not only permitted H2 diffusion to the Co sites for activation and prevented the accessibility of N-heteroarenes, but also catalyzed the hydrogenation of N-heteroarenes through hydrogen spillover from the Co site. The dual active site Co@C core–shell nanoparticles can break the limits of conventional metal surface scaling relationships, thus providing unprecedented high selectivity, activity and stability (Fig. 21). Therefore, “yolk–shell” nanostructures can be constructed in which metal particles are encapsulated within a hollow cavity structure and acid groups are implanted within carbon shells, and multilayer hollow structures and encapsulated structures can be used to contain the two active sites in an inner shell and an outer shell, respectively, in order to achieve site separation. Of course, emphasis should also be placed on the suitability of the multi-porous structures and the accessibility of mutual interactions between the different sites, as these two parameters have a major impact on the quick mass transfer of the intermediates and enrichment effect of substrates.

In summary, many advantages of MHCSs have been demonstrated, showing their great potential in biomass hydrogenation. The characteristic of hollow structure MHCSs allows for a remarkable reactant enrichment effect, locally improved reaction rates and accelerated reaction rates, and the tunable metal and carrier interactions of MHCS nanoreactors further enhance the catalytic activity and can contribute to modulating the product distribution in the hydrogenation of biomass-derived molecules. Notably, the spatial compartmentation structure of MHCSs can provide a tailorable nanostructure for supporting the metal nanoparticles and acid groups, enabling dual site separation and preventing catalyst deactivation attributed to coke deposition in the strong acid center. This offers the potential for smoother biomass cascade reactions, which show great potential for replacing cost-intensive redundant operations (including separation, concentration, and purification of intermediates) and preventing coke formation where possible. However, the insights provided by current related studies are still relatively inadequate to fully develop their potential application in biomass conversion, and continuous innovation in the synthesis of MHCS nanoreactors is still needed to generate versatile and targeted nanoreactors.
Hydrodeoxygenation reaction
The hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) process generally involves a combination of different reactions such as dehydration, hydrolysis, decarbonylation and hydrogenation, exhibiting significant advantages such as high efficiency in the elimination or reducation of oxygen content as well as preservation of the carbon number in the product.171,185–187 These reactions generally take place at different reaction sites, and multiphase catalysts containing both metal sites (monometallic and bimetallic sites) and active acidic sites on a carrier, which are often used to suit the specific target reaction.188,189 However, metals are prone to sintering and leaching during catalysis, solid acid supports are subject to phase changes and loss of surface area, in addition to the condensation or polymerization of CO or CC bonds within oxygenated compounds that tend to occur at high temperatures, leading to carbon deposition on the catalyst.183 As a result, improving the interaction between the metal and support becomes complex. MHCSs with excellent physical structures and chemical composition in biomass HDO show great potential to provide reasonable guidance for the design and synthesis of efficient catalysts owing to their flexible metal loading positions, confinement effects, modifiable surface chemical and special functional structures that improve catalyst stability and enhance metal and carrier interactions.
The inherent hollow properties of MHCSs are promising to offer directions for regulating the reaction pathways by selective adsorption of substrates within the hollow void and the interactions with the inner shells as well as having enrichment effects. In a study of Dongil's team, they discovered that encapsulating Ni nanoparticles inside carbon nanotubes favored the generation of methoxycyclohexanol and cyclohexene, whereas loading Ni nanoparticles outside the carbon nanotubes benefited the formation of cyclohexane and cyclohexanone. When Ni is encapsulated inside the carbon nanotubes, the adsorption of cyclohexene is highly restricted due to the tilted orientation of cyclohexene on Ni(111), leading to a higher catalytic activity towards olefins.190 Tuning the interaction between substrates and hollow inner cavity could present a novel tactic to adjust the selectivity of the target products by confining reactions within the chambers.
Hollow carbon supports with heteroatom-doping and defects were also employed to load metal active NPs with manipulated support and metal interactions, which displayed remarkable benefits in improving the catalytic performance of MHCS nanoreactors. A new series of Pd/CFR catalysts with controlled defects, vacancies and oxygen groups were synthesized by adjusting the calcination temperature using resorcinol–formaldehyde resin carbon spheres (CFR) as a carrier with a low loading of Pd. The Pd/CFR-800 catalyst prepared using polymethylhydrosiloxane (PMHS) as an effective green hydride source showed excellent hydrodeoxyvanillin activity with >99.5% yield of MMP within 1 h at 70 °C. In combination with the mechanistic studies and experimental results, the synergistic effect of defects and adjacent hydroxyl groups is considered to be the key reason for the intense adsorption of the reactants, which greatly facilitates the critical hydrogenolysis process191 (Fig. 22). A magnetically separable and efficient catalyst consisting of bimetallic ZnO and Co NPs deposited on nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (ZnO/Co@N-CNTs) was prepared via direct calcination of bimetallic Zn/Co zeolite imidazole frameworks for the efficient HDO of vanillin. The presence of nitrogen on the carbon nanotube backbone inhibits metal leaching and induces hydrogen spillover effects to some extent and the amorphous ZnO is highly Lewis acidic, which effectively promotes the reaction process. The catalyst achieves almost full conversion of vanillin to its corresponding deoxygenated species in aqueous media without by-product generation.192

In conclusion, MHCSs show great potential in biomass HDO, where their inherent hollow structure not only causes enrichment of reactants but also promises to regulate the reaction pathways. The introduction of the diverse heteroatoms, surface functional groups and defects on the surfaces of the catalysts could provide anchor sites for immobilized metal components, increase the acidic sites, regulate the surface electronic properties, and modulate the hydrogen spillover effect, which could also greatly affect the catalytic performance. Remarkably, MHCS nanoreactors with spatial separation can separate the metal sites from the acid sites to prevent catalyst deactivation owing to coke deposition on strong acid centers. It can also be coupled with the hydrogen spillover phenomenon to achieve a hydrogen enrichment effect, resulting in fast stabilization of the intermediate product. However, novel MHCSs with spatial compartmentation structures, defects, heteroatom doping, for HDO applications in typical biomass-derived molecules and their potential promise have not yet been concretely developed and demonstrated, as the relevant research is still in its infancy and further studies by researchers are still required.
Oxidation reaction
Many highly functionalized compounds like aldehydes, alcohols and carboxylic acids could be obtained from catalytic oxidation reactions,10 which are one of the significant chemical reactions for the valorization of biomass and the production of fine chemicals, fragrances and drugs.193 N-doped carbon hollow nanospheres (CuO/N–C-HNSs) loaded with ultrafine CuO particles were constructed using SiO2 as the hard template and histidine as the C and N precursor for the direct generation of furan-2,5-dimethylcarboxylate in the oxidative esterification of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural194 (Fig. 23a–g). As shown in Fig. 23h, the reaction starts with the formation of a tert-butoxyl or tert-butylperoxyl radical from tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP) in the presence of CuO/N–C-HNSs. Subsequently, the tert-butoxyl radical undergoes unimolecular decomposition to produce a methyl radical and acetone. The 2,5-dimethylfuran or 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) undergoes oxidation in the presence of TBHP and a catalyst to form an acyloxyl radical, which reacts with the methyl radical to produce the desired product. The CuO/N–C-HNSs showed superior catalytic activity in the selective oxidative esterification of HMF to furan-2,5-dimethylcarboxylate (FDMC) with a 93% yield, attributed in large part to the intense N doping promoting interactions between the copper species and support and the hollow spherical structure induced high mesoporosity facilitating the mass transfer. Wang et al.195 reported that Pt NPs supported on carbon nanotubes (Pt/CNTs) under base-free conditions are an efficient and powerful heterogeneous catalyst for the selective oxidation of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) in water. The Pt/CNT displayed high catalytic performance, yielding up to 96.0% FDCA under the optimal reaction conditions (110 °C, 1.0 MPa O2, 12 h). The pyridine-type nitrogen plays a crucial role in the selective oxidation of HMF, which can be attributed to the basic site. Wan et al. developed an efficient and stable carbon nanotube-loaded Au–Pd alloy catalyst for the oxidation of HMF to FDCA in water in the absence of any base. The intensified adsorption of HMF and intermediates on the surface-functionalized CNT with more carbonyl/quinone and fewer carboxyl groups surface greatly facilitated the aerobic oxidation of HMF to FDCA. Besides supporting the improved adsorption, there is a marked synergistic effect when the Pd and Au in the alloy oxidize the HMF to FDCA without bases.196 Thus, the tuning of surface functional groups, heteroatom doping and defects on the carbon carriers is expected to modulate the adsorption of reactants or possible intermediates and as acid–base sites to influence the catalytic performance, contributing to the development of effective oxidation catalysts, all of which require further investigation.

Dehydrogenation reaction
Dehydrogenation reaction is an extremely important process involved in the conversion of biomass, such as bio-oil production and produce H2 and value-added chemicals from biomass resources.10 MHCSs have a high potential for catalytic performance in selective dehydrogenation due to their large specific surface area, modifiable surface chemical and highly dispersed metal active centers. Bulushev et al.197,198 showed a single-atom catalyst consisting of nitrogen-doped carbon nanofibers loaded with noble metals, which was produced via anchoring a platinum group metal onto mesoporous nitrogen-functionalized carbon nanofibers. The active sites of the atoms loaded onto the nitrogen-doped carbon nanofibers were determined to be an isolated Pt metal atom bound to a couple of pyridine-type N atoms at the margin of the carbon nanofiber sheets. The activity of the nitrogen-doped carbon nanofiber loaded Pt single atom catalyst was 3–10 times higher than that of the nitrogen-free catalysts during the selective dehydrogenation of formic acid to H2. A highly stable single-atom Pd catalyst was synthesized using N-doped carbon nanotubes (N-CNTs) as a carrier, showing high activity in the formic acid decomposition reaction. Palladium is in an isolated ionic state and remains stable when heated in hydrogen up to 500 °C. The high stability of Pd2+ is determined by its interaction with the nitrogen-containing N-CNT fragments of graphene sheets.199 Ma et al. synthesized fully exposed Pt cluster catalysts on core–shell nanodiamond@graphene (ND@G) hybrid carriers (a-PtSn/ND@G), which were uniformly dispersed by strong interaction with the carriers and by the partitioning of monodisperse Sn species. The prepared a-PtSn/ND@G catalysts showed outstanding catalytic activity in the dehydrogenation of n-butane at relatively low temperatures, resulting in a > 98% selectivity towards olefin products, which was due in large part to the efficient use of Pt atoms and the facile desorption of butene from these atoms in fully exposed and stable Pt clusters.200 Li et al. synthesized metal organic framework (MOF)-derived Co–N–C catalysts with isolated single Co atoms and compared them with Co NPs catalysts used for formic acid dehydrogenation. The Co-ZIF and ZnCo-ZIF catalysts were constructed through the coordination of Co2+ and Co2+/Zn2+ junctions with 2-methylimidazole. With the introduction of Zn2+, the Co2+ ions in the zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) could be spatially isolated and bound by linkages, followed by the reduction of the metal ions through pyrolysis process. Due to the evaporation of Zn, the metal ions were uniformly dispersed at the atomic level on the N-doped porous carbon (Fig. 24a–d). The Co–N–C (SACs) catalysts exhibited an optimum gas rate of 23.6 L gCo−1 h−1 (Fig. 24e), and further research demonstrated that homogeneously dispersed Co–N–C catalysts are highly reactive and acid resistant, enhancing the catalytic activity and stability.201

In conclusion, monodisperse metal catalysts on hollow carbon supports have been thought about and show great potential in biomass dehydrogenation reactions, and functional groups have a significant influence on catalysis, such as the position and conformation of the doping atom. At the same time, different tactics to enhance the efficiency of dehydrogenation are available, such as the introduction of a second metal promoter, the modulation of the local environment, the selection of alternative metal centers or the introduction of plasmas for certain photosensitive catalysts.10
MHCS application towards CO2 utilization
The environmental problems of global warming and climate deterioration in recent years are due in large part to the rapid development of industrial technology and human activity leading to the emission of CO2 and other trace gases into the atmosphere, particularly with regard to the combustion of hydrocarbons.11,202,203 The use of CO2 as a carbon feedstock to effectively mitigate the greenhouse effect and provide renewable chemicals and fuels has attracted increasing attention. The production of useful chemicals and fuels through CO2 capture, photocatalytic and electrocatalytic CO2 hydrogenation holds great promise and is expected to play an important role in achieving a carbon cycle.204,205
CO2 capture
CO2 capture and storage technologies can be an effective strategy for reducing total emissions. A variety of stratagems have been developed including amine absorption, membrane separation, ionic liquid absorption and others.206–208 Amine absorption has been used to remove CO2 from industrial waste gas, which is an effective and important technique for industrial CO2 capture.209 However, equipment corrosion, high energy consumption, as well as degradation and loss of amine, are intractable issues to limit its large-scale application. Membrane separation technologies are still too expensive to be used for the separation of CO2 and their development is still in progress.210
In this case, solid carbon adsorbents exhibit high specific surface area, multifunctional active groups, and low energy consumption, especially hollow carbon spheres have attracted attention.211 Hollow carbon spheres show favorable physical properties with tunable porosities and large surface areas, making them promising as economical and effective CO2 adsorbents.212 Moreover, they could undergo a chemical modification process, introducing additional surface functional groups to further enhance the adsorption effect. The correlation between the adsorption effect of CO2 and the physical characteristics of hollow carbon spheres has been investigated and analyzed in a number of studies. Liu et al.213 used SiO2 spheres as a template and resorcinol and formaldehyde as carbon precursors to reasonably synthesize HCSs with tunable microporous shells for CO2 adsorption by adjusting the molar ratio of TEOS to SiO2 from 0 to 0.72(Fig. 25a–f). Fig. 25g shows the increase in CO2 capacity from 1.82 to 2.63 mmol g−1 as the microporosity of the carbon spheres increases, which was largely attributed to the increase caused by the TEOS dosage, indicating that the additional microporosity created by the silane additive facilitates the adsorption of CO2. HCS-S0.54 showed a higher percentage of micropore surface area with 91.3% and micropore volume of 62.7%, exhibiting a higher capacity for CO2 uptake. Although the microporous volume of HCS-S0.72 was slightly higher than that of HCS-S0.54, the spherical shape of the former was disrupted, leading to a reduction in the adsorption capacity of the cavity for the gas. At the same pressure and temperature, the adsorption capacity of HCS on N2 was also tested. The CO2/N2 separation coefficients ranged from 7.3 to 9.4, indicating that hollow carbon spheres are a potentially selective adsorbent for the separation of N2 and CO2. The high selectivity is probably due to the dispersion between the CO2 and HCS frameworks, providing guidance for selective adsorption.

The modifiable surface of MHCSs further enhances the ability to adsorb CO2; of particular concern is the introduction of N dopants to carbon substrates, which could expose more anchored active basic sites to facilitate the interaction between the carbon surface and CO2 molecules, resulting in the promotion of gas adsorption.214,215 In general, two methods have been developed to achieve this goal, including the use of high nitrogen-containing precursors and post treatment of carbons with amine or ammonia.216,217 The nitrogen precursor-doped carbon material approach is more attractive in that it allows direct access to nitrogen-doped porous carbon through a simple activation process, whereas the post-treatment approach often leads to blocking of the pores of the porous carbon, which greatly limits the adsorption of CO2. The CO2 captured using the modified carbon material can be converted into a useful product, which would be highly desirable. Monodisperse N-doped HCS were synthesized by microwave-assisted synthesis and subsequent carbonization, where the aromatic ring of hexamethoxymethylamine (HMMM) was used as the nitrogen source. The experimental results demonstrated that the high selectivity of N-doped HCS for CO2, which could be attributed to the abundance of pyridinic sites in the carbon matrix that could selectively and efficiently bind acidic CO2 (ref. 218) (Fig. 26). Similarly, Lan et al. described the use of an in situ self-induced approach to fabricate catalysts of ultra-small Ag nanoparticles anchored on hollow N-doped carbon nanotubes, which were effectively applied for CO2 adsorption and direct carboxylation with alkynes. The Ag NPs have a high coordination ability towards unsaturated alkynes, producing acetylene silver intermediates. In addition, the N species (pyridine N and pyrrole N) could trap CO2 molecules as well as activate them into electrophilic substances (Step I). The electrophilic attack on the alkyne group generates the silver carboxylate intermediate (Step II), which could be readily acidified to carboxylic acids (Step III).219 The catalyst exhibited superior catalytic performance and excellent recoverability in the carboxylation of alkynes with CO2 due in large part to the nitrogen-doped porous structure effectively enabling gas adsorption and mass transfer in CO2 and inhibiting nanoparticle leaching, presenting a novel and interesting way for CO2 conversion.

In summary, attention needs to be paid to translating the capture technology into an effective method for CO2 emissions, particularly from industries such as coal-fired power plants. In this case, hollow carbon spheres are a promising candidate material for CO2 capture due to their large specific surface area and controlled microporous nature, which is important for CO2 adsorption, but the long-term storage of CO2 is potentially unstable and requires to be further explored. In addition, research continues to modify the surface of carbon sphere samples with different chemical pathways to incorporate relevant basic functional fractions to produce an increasing number of active sites for the capture of CO2. However, their adsorption mechanisms still require to be refined; most importantly, the study of selective adsorption. In addition, the long-term stability and sustainability, as well as the renewability of the adsorbent remains in question. Furthermore, once the CO2 molecules have been sequestered from the mixed gas stream, the selective and efficient conversion of CO2 molecules into useful chemicals is still incomplete.
CO2 electroreduction
Renewable energy driven electrochemical CO2 reduction can be a promising method for converting abundant CO2 into gaseous fuels or high energy products (e.g., HCOOH, CO, CH3OH, CH4, C2H5OH and C2H4).220–223 However, electrocatalytic CO2 reduction is a challenging process because CO2 molecules are particularly stable under ambient conditions and conversion of CO2 to CO2− requires high overpotentials. Moreover, it is necessary to avoid the competing and often kinetically favorable reduction of water to hydrogen, making the search for robust electroreduction reaction catalysts with high activity, selectivity and stability, and low overpotential extremely difficult.29,221,224
Hollow carbon nanostructures exhibit significant advantages as electrocatalysts, including large specific surface area, highly exposed active sites, promoted transport pathways for charges, and so on, which make them prospective candidates for electrocatalytic reactions.76 A series of hollow carbon spheres loaded with Ni–N4 catalysts (Ni/HMCS) with different geometries were prepared using SiO2 templates and the introduction of a nickel source during the polymerization of dopamine.225 The ultra-thin carbon shell alters the electronic structure of the carbon skeleton, and the suitably sized mesopores in the shell accelerate the diffusion and spillover of substances. Moreover, the abundant pyrrolic-N content and larger carbon skeleton defects can effectively activate CO2 molecules. Combining the advantages of the abundant Ni–N4 active sites and the optimized geometry, the optimized Ni single-atom catalysts obtained show excellent catalytic activity for CO2 electroreduction. Compared to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), faradaic efficiencies was up to 95% for CO in the range of −0.7 to −1.1 V with turnover frequency (TOF) values up to 15608 h−1 have been achieved (Fig. 27). Pan et al. reported a highly active and selective catalyst for the electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 with atomically dispersed Co sites anchored on polymer-derived hollow nitrogen-doped porous carbon spheres (HNPCSs) with large surface area, abundant N coordination sites and high electrical conductivity, as shown in Fig. 28a–c. The CO Faraday efficiency (FECO) exceeded 90% over a wide potential range of −0.57 to −0.88 V and after 10 hours of electrolysis, the CO current density and FECO remained almost constant, showing remarkable stability. DFT simulations and control experiments showed that the Co–N5 site as the dominant active center for the activation of CO2 and the rapid formation of COOH* intermediates as well as the desorption of CO, resulting in high selectivity (Fig. 28d–g).226 A novel CO2 electrocatalytic reduction (CO2RR) catalyst consisting of monodispersed Ni species on N-doped hollow carbon spheres (SA-Ni/N-CS) was prepared using silica/polydopamine microspheres as the template with a carbon and nitrogen source. The SA-Ni/N-CS catalyst showed excellent efficiency and selectivity for the conversion of CO2 to CO with a Faraday efficiency (FE) of 95.1% due to the introduction of atomically dispersed nickel and a distinctive hollow sphere structure. In addition, SA-Ni/N-CS showed ultra-high stability, with current density and FE remaining above 99% and 95% respectively after 24 hours of CO2RR testing.227 These examples provide a convenient path for the development of non-precious metal single-atom catalysts with adjustable coordination environments and metal loading in the field of electrocatalytic reduction.

In addition to the hollow structure rich in active sites with high specific surface area, high electrical conductivity and excellent stability, the functionalization of the material surface can further change the internal electronic structure, enhance the adsorption of CO2 and improve the adhesion between the material and the intermediate. A common strategy is to introduce heteroatoms into the carbon matrix, which could alter the charge and spin density of the carbon atoms in the vicinity of the dopant. Representative heteroatom dopants are nitrogen (N), sulfur (S) and boron (B), which display electronegativity different from that of carbon atoms and could break the electroneutrality of the pure carbon structure, inducing charge redistribution and creating reactive sites for activation and adsorption of CO2.228 Moreover, heteroatom-doped modified carbon-based catalysts have a high H2 precipitation potential, which inhibits H2O reduction, leading to high energy efficiency and fast kinetics (Table 6). Chen et al.229 synthesized metal-free doped carbon catalysts with a highly homogeneous cylindrical channel structure by self-assembly of resol (carbon precursor), dicyandiamide (nitrogen precursor) and F127 (soft template). The resulting catalyst can selectively and efficiently electrochemically convert CO2 to C2H5OH with a high FE of 77% at −0.56 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode. The uniformly distributed pyridinic-N and pyrrolic-N in the inner layer of the cylindrical channel allows efficient electron transfer for dimerization of *CO intermediates and to realize C–C coupling. Song et al.230 designed nitrogen-doped ordered mesoporous carbon (MNC) with channel walls embedded with medium micropores to promote the coupling of critical intermediates and electrocatalytic CO2 reconditioning for production of ethanol. The maximum C2H5OH production rates of 2.3 mmol g−1 h−1 were achieved over the MNC catalyst. The experiments and DFT calculations showed that moderate microporous structures with active pyridinic and pyrrolic N sites lead to fast kinetics of charge transfer and high electric driving potentials, which are essential to enhance ethanol formation. Li et al.231 designed N, P co-doped carbon materials for CO2 electrochemical reduction to CO, exhibiting 92% FE CO and stability up to 24 hours. The co-doping showed effectively enhanced electrochemical reduction activity compared to single atom doping. This is attributed to the synergistic effect between the N and P dopants, which regulated the properties of the active sites. The P doping effectively enhances the catalytic capacity of pyridine and pyrrole nitrogen, and significantly reduces the free energy of COOH* formation and the barrier of CO2 activation. This result provides additional optimization methods for metal-free catalysts to improve CO2 electrochemical reduction performance and develops the theoretical basis for co-doping strategies at the molecular level.

The presence of carbon defects alters the surface electronegativity of the carbon substrate and affects the electrocatalytic activity. Zhu's group232 synthesized nitrogen-doped hollow carbon spheres anchored cobalt phthalocyanine electrocatalysts in which carbon defects and electron absorption effects of the heteroatom N were responsible for modulating the electronic structure of the metal center. The optimize electrocatalyst showed a high CO Faraday efficiency of 95.68% with a turnover frequency of 13.80 s−1 and a current density of 16.49 mA cm−2 at an overpotential of 760 mV. The DFT theory and experiment suggested that the high density carbon defects enhance the electron absorption capacity of the carbon matrix and that pyrrolic N acts as an axial ligand to coordinate with the Co atom in cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPc), helping to tune the electronic structure of the Co atom, lowering the energy barrier for *COOH formation and promoting CO2 activation.
Hollow carbon nanostructures exhibit significant advantages as electrocatalysts, including increased contact area between reactants and catalysts, highly exposed active sites, increased transport pathways for charges, and so on, which make them promising candidates for these electrocatalytic reactions. In the case of electrocatalysts for CO2 electroreduction, transition metal single-atom catalysts are increasingly being explored or practical applications, taking into account atom economy and high activity. Moreover, surface modifications such as heteroatom doping and defect fabrication enhance metal and carrier interactions to further modulate the electronic structure and promote electrocatalytic activity. It is worth noting that the origin of the active sites in doped modified carbon sphere metal-free catalysts undoubtedly provides guidance for the design and synthesis of more efficient catalysts at the molecular level. A combination of theoretical simulations and well thought out experimental designs, such as higher doping levels and controlled doping configurations, is required to reveal reaction mechanisms. In addition, the electroreduction of CO2 is a multi-step electron transfer process, with further reduction and coupling of intermediates providing benefits for multi-carbon products. The development of multisite nanoreactors holds promise for the efficient production of high value-added products such as alcohols and olefins through cascade reactions. In this respect, the design of nanoreactors and the modulation of the microenvironment around synergistic active sites in nano-spaces are considered effective strategies in this regard. Moreover, in practice, the stability of the electrode, including the catalyst and carrier components, is equally important and more effort should be made to assess the stability of the active catalyst.
CO2 photoreduction
Photocatalysis using abundant and clean sunlight as an energy source presents a sustainable route to drive the conversion of CO2 into selective chemical products (e.g. ethane, methane, ethanol, methanol, formate, etc.).241–243 Catalysis that mimics photosynthesis in nature typically involves the absorption of light by the photocatalyst, separation and transport of the photoelectric charge, and the reactions on the catalyst surface.244 At present, the engineering of hollow carbon nanostructures can enhance the benefits of improving photocatalytic CO2 conversion by modulating light absorption and charge transport through microenvironmental effects, which is an important technology for photocatalytic CO2 conversion.245 Specifically, the hollow structure has a high specific surface area, which is conducive to enhancing the adsorption of reactants and promoting redox reactions. At the same time, the multiple reflections within the cavity can improve the efficiency of solar energy utilization by multi-light scattering/reflection, and the separation and transfer of photogenerated charges are facilitated by the thin shell layer that shortens the diffusion length of the photogenerated charges.86,246,247 On the other hand, carbon materials, particularly graphene, with their excellent electrical conductivity as well as superior electron mobility, are often used to construct composite photocatalysts for enhancing the transport of photogenerated charge carriers.248–250 Notably, magnetic nanoparticles in hollow carbon, which could be easily captured by an external magnetic field, can be easily separated, and the particulate photocatalyst can be reused in practical applications.251,252 Xu et al. synthesized magnetic hollow spheres consisting of discrete nickel particles surrounded by several layers of graphitic carbon (Ni@GC) for the stable and efficient photoreduction of CO2 under visible light (Fig. 29a–d).253 As shown in Fig. 29e–h, the Ni@C interface with Ru NPs effectively achieves improved charge transportation and separation owing to the beneficial Fermi level and electrical conductivity of the graphite layer. Under visible light irradiation, the Ru(bpy)32+ photosensitizer was stimulated to the excited state [Ru(bpy)3]2+*, which was reductively quenched by triethanolamine to produce the reduced species of [Ru(bpy)3]+. Subsequently, the excited electrons of the reduced photosensitizer would be delocalized and transferred to the Ni@GC catalysts. Owing to the favorable charge mobility of the graphite shell and the Ni–C bond, the photo-induced electrons could be rapidly transferred to the Ni center, and the electron-rich Ni centers promote the electrophilic activation and conversion of CO2 to produce CO products (Fig. 29i). Similarly, photosensitized porous metallic and magnetic 1200 Co–C composites are coupled with a [Ru(bpy)3]Cl2 photosensitizer for efficient CO2 reduction in a sustainable and selective manner.251 The central cobalt metal is the active center for activation of the adsorbed CO2 molecule and the surface graphitic carbon coating on the cobalt metal is essential for the triple metal–ligand charge transfer of the photosensitizer Ru(bpy)32+, resulting in an efficient increase in CO2 photoreduction, with a CO selectivity of 64.21% and yield of 1258.30 μl.

In addition to the advantages of its hollow structure, recently, MHCSs with special functional structures such as spatially separated structures and heterojunctions have attracted interest, which is an effective means to photocatalytic CO2 reduction. Lang et al.254 proposed a step-by-step route for the in situ growth of graphene islands with controlled distribution on TaON particles (TaON@G), providing an excellent photocatalyst for visible light-driven CO2 reduction (Fig. 30a and b). This complex hybrid of graphene and TaON induced a large concentration of free electrons and high electrical conductivity, with electrons transferred to the hollow graphene co-catalyst, facilitating CO2 reduction and CH4 formation. At the same time, a Schottky junction could be created and reverse resistance property of the Schottky barrier could significantly impede the reverse transfer of photoexcited hot electrons captured by graphene. Thus, light-induced charge carriers are spatially separated and the holes in TaON are free to diffuse towards the surface and oxidize H2O to provide protons. This separated activation of H2O and CO2 in different spatial locations facilitates the delay of the reverse reaction and accelerates both processes simultaneously and the optimized TaON@G realized a CO2-to-CH4 yield of 1.61 μmol g−1 h−1, which was almost 13 times greater compared to pristine TaON and exceeded that of most Ta-based (oxy)nitride catalysts (Fig. 30c–g). The research emphasizes the significance of the rational design of superior spatially separated photocatalysts to collaboratively integrate the functional and structural advantages for maximizing the catalytic activity. Moreover, the rational selection of different semiconductors with suitable energy band structures to build heterojunctions is an effective approach to enhance the photocatalytic performance. The built-in electric field developed at the interface between the different phases can drive the directional separation and transfer of photogenerated carriers to reduce charge recombination.255 It is worth noting that the physical structure and chemical composition of the individual components of the heterostructure can be adjusted to achieve synergistic effects with variable and tailored functionality.256,257 Hollow In2S3/polymeric carbon-nitride (IS/CN) heterojunctions were fabricated by in situ sulfidation under solvothermal conditions and electrostatic self-assembly.258 Both IS and CN are stimulated by visible light irradiation, producing holes and electrons, with the electrons leaping into the conduction band (CB) and the holes remaining in the valence band (VB). Because of the resulting heterojunction, the photogenerated holes in the VB of the CN are transferred to the VB of the IS, while the photogenerated electrons in the CB of the IS are move to the CB of the CN. Subsequently, the [Co(bpy)3]2+ co-catalyst traps the photogenerated electrons to produce [Co(bpy)3]+, which could readily transfer them to CO2, completing the CO2-to-CO reaction and accompanied by the recovery of [Co(bpy)3]2+. The optimized IS/CN catalyst presented a high CO analysis rate of 483.4 μmol g−1 h−1, which was 6 and 99 times higher than that of CN and IS, respectively, attributing to the hollow nanostructures and enhanced CO2 adsorption capacity and improved charge separation and transfer.

In addition to the structural advantages, the surface composition can effectively enhance the photocatalytic reaction, which provides guidance for the construction of reasonably efficient catalysts.259 Heteroatom doping is a common method for tuning the electrical or optical absorption properties by modifying the charge carrier density or band structures.260,261 At the same time, defect engineering plays an important role in modulating the chemical composition and phase structure of the light-driven catalyst which could affect the absorption of visible light and carrier transport and separation, and could also be used as an active center for CO2 adsorption and activation.262 Sagara et al.261 successfully prepared gC3N4 electrode films doped with boron atoms (BCNx) for photoelectrochemical CO2 reduction reactions under visible light. The BCNx photocathode showed a relatively stronger cathodic photocurrent under AM 1.5 G solar simulated light compared to the undoped g-C3N4. Tian et al.263 rationally designed and prepared sulphur-doped hollow hexagonal prismatic photocatalysts with coating a thin layer of carbon by synthesizing Ce doped hexagonal prisms and a subsequent pyrolysis procedure. The hollow hexagonal heterogeneous structure and appropriate surface oxygen vacancy defects could effectively facilitate charge separation and prolong the lifetime of the photoinduced charge carriers, and the carbon coating and sulfur-doping significantly enhance the visible light absorption capacity of the hybrid. Thus, the synergistic effect of the carbon coating, sulphur doping and the distinctive hollow porous hexagonal prism shape resulted in an optimized catalyst, which exhibited excellent CO2 photoreduction active with high CH4 selectivity of 92.4% and yield of 60.6 μmol g−1 h−1 in the absence of noble metals and organic photosensitizers. Li et al.264 showed a in situ electrostatic assembly method for attracting interfacial oxygen vacancy in Co-based spinel/carbon nitride direct Z-scheme heterojunctions with ultra-high charge transfer efficiency (Fig. 31a–c). The electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) signal and enhanced photo/electrocatalytic activity of the composites evidenced a direct Z-scheme mechanism for directed interfacial charge transfer (Fig. 31d–g). Comprehensive theoretical calculations demonstrate that the interfacial oxygen vacancy could serve as electron traps for charge recombination, thereby inhibiting reverse charge transfer and maintaining the efficient redox capability of the heterojunction (Fig. 31h). Moreover, the adsorption and activation of CO2 are enhanced due to the distinctive synergistic effect of abundant oxygen vacancies and residual –NH2, which presents a strong insight into the rational design of catalysts with controlled interfacial electron flow modulated by interfacial defects.

In the light of the progress discussed above, it is evident that the superior performance of MHCSs as photocatalysts allows for improved light scattering and harvesting, reduced distance for charge migration and directed charge separation, and abundant surface reactive sites of the carbon shells. Notably, in the design of effective hollow nanostructured photocatalytic systems, the adsorption capacity and transfer efficiency of the photogenerated carriers can be improved through defect engineering, surface modification and structural engineering. The improved the stability of the catalyst can be achieved by designing protective layers to avoid photo-corrosion. However, challenges remain in the development and utilization of catalysts. Currently, the reduction mechanism of CO2 is still obscure, which hinders the development of efficient hollow structured photocatalysts. One of the important reasons for this is the lack of suitable characterization techniques for photocatalysts and photocatalytic activity, especially in situ characterization. In addition, the lack of understanding of the key factors that initiate the photoreduction catalysis of CO2 makes it challenging to manage the pathway and selectivity of the target product because of the wide range of products (e.g. CO, CH4, CH3).
CO2 thermal hydrogenation
CO2 hydrogenation is an excellent method for converting CO2 into fuels and chemicals, with products such as methane, methanol, carbon monoxide, formate and ethanol, among others.10 CO2 molecules are normally activated at high temperatures and pressures, which would subject small nanoparticle catalysts to deactivation by metal sintering and coke deposition. In this case, MHCSs with distinctive hollow structure can protect metal particles from sintering and show high specific surface area and porous structure size limitation and expos more mobile active sites for the reactants, providing a concentrated microenvironment for CO2 hydrogenation to various products.265,266 Moreover, MHCSs are steady in alkaline solutions, which is essential for speeding up the efficiency of the CO2 hydrogenation reaction. Yang et al.267 developed a composite of mononuclear Ru3+ and porous organic polymers (POPs) containing nitrogen and phosphorus heteroatoms confined in mesoporous hollow carbon spheres (Ru3+-0.5 mmolPOPs@MHCS) for CO2 hydrogenation to formate (Fig. 32a–h). The stability and activity of Ru3+-0.5 mmolPOPs@MHCS were markedly higher compared to Ru3+-POPs as they were encapsulated in the cavity of the MHCS, with a turnover number (TON) of 1228 and TOF of 51 h−1 after 24 h. Reaction kinetic studies have shown that POP polymers containing N, P are favorable for CO2 adsorption. In addition, when Ru3+-POPs are encapsulated in the MHCS cavity, the activation energy barrier is reduced, probably because the MHCS has a high specific surface area, which promotes the dispersion of Ru3+-POPs and increases the contact area with the substrates, while the hollow nanostructure facilitates the accumulation of reactants and accelerates the reaction (Fig. 32i–l). Liu et al.268 tuned the pyrolytic behavior of ZIF-8 via the addition of iron and iron/potassium to form carbon envelopes Fe NPs and metal NPs encapsulated hollow sphere structures, respectively (FeZn-NC and FeZnK-NC) for the CO2 hydrogenation. The FeZn-NC and FeZnK-NC exhibited high activity with 29.3% and 34.6% CO2 conversion, and the selectivity of C2+ was about 63 C-mol% on FeZn-NC catalyst and outstanding selectivity (e.g. >57 C-mol%) for value-added hydrocarbons (light olefins and long-chain hydrocarbons) over the two catalysts. Yang et al.269 designed ultra-fine and uniformly dispersed PdAg nanoparticles encapsulated in mesoporous hollow carbon spheres containing polymers with amino groups for the reduction of CO2 to formic acid. The PdAg alloyed NPs dispersed in the vicinity of the amino polymer in the hollow nanostructured catalyst showed enhanced catalytic selectivity and stability, displaying a high turnover number of 2680 after 24 h at 100 °C. First, the reaction starts with H2 adsorption and activation on the Pd atom (Step 1), and bicarbonate (HCO3−) is adsorbed on the Ag atom due to electron transfer from Ag to Pd (Step 2), where the dissolution of CO2 in alkaline aqueous solution leads to its further conversion to HCO3− (Step 3). The nucleophilic hydrogen atoms formed on Pd react with the HCO3− adsorbed on Ag to form the dissociated formate (Step 5) (Fig. 33). The N-doped carbon (NC) immobilized ruthenium (RuCl3) catalyst for the hydrogenation of CO2 to formate.141 The total N content and pyrrolic-N structure decreased with increasing carbonization temperature, while the graphitic-N structure increased. The optimized catalysts displayed high turnover numbers of 18212 for the 12 h reaction at 120 °C and 8.0 MPa and had high stability, retaining their original properties upon recovery. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and high resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (HRSTEM) analysis showed that ruthenium was present as a highly dispersed atomic level Ru3+ species on the NC support. DFT calculations indicated that among the various possible N and metal coordination sites, the N2− pyrrolic/pyridinic coordination sites exhibited the highest ruthenium loading stability, whereas the graphitic-N coordination sites were the least stable. Thus, the excellent catalytic behavior of the catalyst is attributed to the strong binding of Ru to pyrrolic-N.

Hollow carbon materials that provide a concentrated microenvironment utilizing the confinement effect can exhibit higher performance. In addition, surface modification allows the nanoreactors to become multifunctional catalysts, further enhancing the interaction between reactants and catalysts and improving the stability and activity. In addition, multifunctional cascade types of nanoreactors allow for smooth tandem reactions, but require further research into the CO2 mechanism by researchers. However, these materials need to be studied more for their catalytic activity and reaction properties in order to better understand these materials and unlock their true potential as high-performance catalysts.
Conclusion and outlook
The manageable architectural parameters of carbon materials and their adjustable interactions with metal NPs make MHCSs outstanding candidates for the development of sustainable energy systems for a more environmentally friendly modern lifestyle. Here, the central insights concentrated on the preparation and confined microenvironmental effects of MHCSs, and their great potential for converting biomass and CO2 into chemicals and fuels. The methods for the design and construction of MHCSs with the desired physical structure and chemical composition were summarized, including pre-synthesis, post-synthesis, and one-pot synthesis, with particular reference to their unique features, advantages, disadvantages, and recent corresponding innovations. Additionally, in a detailed case study, we endeavored to provide useful insights into the confined microenvironmental effects of MHCSs, which could help to achieve targeted nanostructure engineering. Furthermore, MHCSs for the conversion of biomass and CO2 show significant potential through photocatalysis, thermal catalysis, and electrocatalysis in several industrially relevant reactions, including hydrogenation, hydrodeoxygenation, oxidation, dehydrogenation, and reduction, and these were highlighted. However, many challenges will require to be addressed in future studies, and looking ahead, we believe that subsequent efforts should focus on the following areas.
(1) The synthesis of high-quality MHCSs with ideal physicochemical microenvironments (e.g. tunable chemical composition, controlled particle size, tunable mesopore size and spatially separated structures) by simple and controlled methods still presents significant challenges. Firstly, the intricate multi-step process and potentially toxic reagents required are still considered inevitable for the preparation of most MHCS nanoreactors; thus finding simplified and scalable preparation strategies is still considered crucial to achieving excellent catalytic sustainability. Secondly, more attention should be paid to the precise control of geometrical and compositional parameters over these factors, such as modulating the morphology and size of metal nanoparticles, optimizing the thickness and pore size distribution of the shell layer, cavity size, and changing the electronic behavior of the internal metal nanoparticle/shell surface through ligand modifications, providing sufficient scope for the design of efficient catalytically functionalized nanoreactors. Furthermore, as far as current laboratory research is concerned, the weight output of MHCS nanoreactors is only at the gram or even milligram level, and more attention should be paid to the large-scale construction of MHCS nanoreactors, which influences their potential for further industrial applications. In this respect, spray technology is a promising alternative to synthetic hollow materials, which can be easily scaled up. However, this technique usually produces particles with large variations in size and morphology, and precise tuning is challenging. The template-free or soft templated methods based on the fewer synthesis steps will be the way forward. However, these approaches are usually limited to specific material systems and there is still a need to expand and develop existing and new approaches to optimize the preparation steps and reduce raw material costs for the functionalization of MHCSs. Additionally, improving the microenvironment to enhance the performance of MHCSs ultimately points the way to large-scale preparation. Notably, it is encouraging to find that increasing number of efforts are being made to enhance the recyclability and stability of MHCSs, which would potentially contribute to avoiding unnecessary loss in these small amounts of catalysts. At the same time, toxicity and environmental impact are always issues associated with industrialization and the use of environmentally friendly reagents for the preparation of catalysts is expected. The biomaterials allowing them to be used as etched templates for constructing hollow cavities may be excellent candidates for consideration, due to their large availability, low cost, low environmental impact and simple removal. Therefore, targeted construction of most MHCS nanoreactors is a prerequisite for achieving the targeted catalytic reactions, which unavoidably requires generous investment in the preparation process involving complicated manufacture operations, time-consuming repeat production, environmentally polluting reagents, etc. It thus appears that striking an optimal balance between catalytic sustainability, fabrication inputs and catalytic efficiency is identified as a critical problem to be solved.
(2) The confinement effects of directionally prepared MHCSs not only briefly describe the essential properties of MHCSs but also further emphasize the potential interrelationship among the hollow carbon sphere nanostructures, reactive metal NPs and substrate molecules. (1) Controlled mass transfer effect is reflected by a significant molecular sieving effect on the nanoreactors, which strongly determines the adsorption and diffusion behaviors of reactants in the confined microenvironment through size selection functions. The ultrathin carbon shells and site adsorption also influence mass transfer rates, which could effectively reduce mass transfer resistance and determine the accessibility of reactants to the reaction site, which further influences the overall reaction rate. However, quantitatively exploring the mechanism of influence between hollow carbon geometry structures and mass transfer behavior of specific intermediates of different sizes, and the development of a viable strategy to induce the preferred adsorption conformation remains technically difficult, and some relevant initial efforts have been undertaken, but further outstanding manipulation strategies require to be presented. (2) The void confinement effect allows for remarkable enrichment of reactants with locally improved reaction rates, accelerating the reaction process. However, to date, there is still little research into the regular relationships between the various structural parameters that play an important role in the significant enrichment and diffusion of reactants in MHCS nanoreactors. (3) Spatial compartmentation effect can provide customizable structures for loading of metal NPs and functional groups, which may offer potential opportunities for realizing smoother cascade reactions and needs to be further developed by researchers. Of course, emphasis should also be placed on the appropriateness of the porous nanostructures and the accessibility between different center sites, as these two parameters play an important role in the fast mass transfer of the intermediates and enrichment of the substrates. (4) The metal size effect, which contributes to improved catalytic activity, and particularly the atomic catalysts with maximum atomic efficiency, uniformly tunable geometrical and electronic configurations and enhanced metal–carrier interactions has sparked a ‘gold rush’ in materials science and physical chemistry research. Single-atom catalysts could vary their nanoparticle counterparts in terms of adsorption energy and adsorption structure to result in different catalytic performances, thus requiring correct selection of metal centers, material substrates, careful tuning and design of local coordination and optimized metal–support interaction to maximize directional conversion performance. (5) The surface modification effect, such as doping of heterogeneous particles (metallic or non-metallic), implementation of defect engineering and modification of surface functionalized groups provides an opportunity to further enhance the catalytic activity of various reactions in biomass and CO2 selective conversion. However, the synergistic effects between these elements, including the defects and surface functionalized groups, nanoparticles and carbon substrates, nanoparticles and defects contributing to excellent catalytic performance still deserve further explanation, and theoretical evidence and reliable experimental work are needed to support these findings.
(3) MHCS nanoreactors with desired confined microenvironmental effects are applied for various catalytic conversions on biomass including hydrodeoxygenation, hydrogenation, dehydrogenation and oxidation due to their customizable geometrical and electronic properties. MHCSs could achieve reactant enrichment phenomenon and modulation of reaction pathways; structural parameters including the pore sizes and wall thicknesses are preconditions for this effect, and nanoreactors with tunable metal and carrier interactions further enhance the catalytic activity. In general practice, doping of heterogeneous particles, modification of surface groups, defect engineering are usually adopted to improve the chemical composition of MHCSs. MHCSs also contribute to modulating the product distribution in a broad continuum cascade reactions of biomass-derived molecules, and manipulating mass transfer behavior and altering the adsorption pattern of active centers, which have been shown to be effective in modulating the paths and selectivity. Specifically, by accurately tuning the nano-structural parameters of carbon materials, the mass transfer behavior could be controlled to realize different accessibilities between active sites and reactants. Additionally, via improving the electronic structure of metal sites through a variety of methods, such as application of site blockers, altering particle sizes, and building bimetallic centers, desired adsorption configurations and preference over metal centers for reactants or intermediates could be realized, leading to precise control of selectivity for reaction targets. Notably, MHCSs with spatial compartmentation structures offer a unique opportunity to address coke formation by separating the metal and acidic sites. However, the insights provided by current related studies are still relatively inadequate to develop their potential for application in biomass conversion, and there is still a need for continuous innovation in the synthesis procedure of MHCS nanoreactors to produce multifunctional and targeted nanoreactors. In addition to the thermal catalytic applications, electrochemical value addition to biomass is also a trending area for storing renewable energy in chemical bonds for future applications. Despite increasing endeavors in this field, such as electrochemical 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furaldehyde oxidation, little has been reported on electrochemical biomass value using MHCSs.270 Inspired by the superior performance of MHCSs during thermal-based biomass conversion, electrocatalytic biomass reactions also have significant potential and represent a novel field of exploration.
(4) MHCSs present great potential for enabling electrocatalytic, photocatalytic and thermal hydrogenation reduction of CO2, and promise to open the door to photoelectric synergistic catalysis. Hollow nanostructures provide a concentrated microenvironment and large specific surface and can generate multiple scattered lights, and thin shells reduce charge carrier transport distances and accelerate charge transport. In addition, surface modifications (heteroatoms, defects, functional groups) and the complexity of heterogeneous structures are used to improve the interaction between metals and carriers, accelerate charge transport and increase the selectivity, stability and activity of the catalyst. Notably, as a typical representative of metal-free catalysts, nanostructured carbon materials are of interest as CO2 reduction catalysts. However, compared to metal catalysts, relevant research is still scarce and further development and in-depth studies are still needed. Although many researchers have investigated the role of surface modification and functional structure facilitation, more detailed and clear experimental proof is still lacking, most importantly due to the lack of suitable in situ characterization techniques. Therefore, incorporating theoretical calculations into electrochemical and catalytic systems and combining them with experimental calculations to reveal structure–composition–property relationships and thus optimize catalysts for improved performance, offering a broad prospect for the preparation of excellent nanostructured materials. Equally important is the long-term operational stability of catalysts with hollow nanostructures, which requires further investigation. In conclusion, MHCSs are attracting increasing interest in the field of CO2 upgradation, but related research is still in its infancy, especially as the precise control of product routes is a great challenge, requiring the synthesis of viable carbon sphere nanoreactors and an in-depth understanding of their mechanisms.
(5) In order to accurately assess the intrinsic catalytic mechanisms, reaction intermediates, reaction pathways, and actual active sites of MHCS nanoreactors, the confined microenvironmental effects for biomass and CO2 conversion require to be explored quantitatively through an integrated approach involving in situ characterization, kinetic experiments and theoretical simulations. Firstly, for the structure of MHCSs, advanced characterization techniques, such as in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high-angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) imaging, time-resolved small-angle and wide-angle X-ray scattering and elemental mapping, provide clear insights into the evolution of nanostructures, which have been extensively involved in the characterization of carbon spheres. Such monitoring could help us to further tune the synthesis scheme to obtain the desired hollow structure. Secondly, for the study of the surface microenvironment of MHCSs and the mechanism of catalytic biomass directed conversion, HAADF-STEM, X-ray absorption spectra (XAS), X-ray diffraction spectroscopy (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), in situ Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and nuclear resonance vibrational spectroscopy have been applied in order to gain a deeper and more comprehensive understanding of the relationship between the physical structure and the chemical composition and activity of the catalysts. However, further development of in situ characterization techniques is still needed to obtain insight into reaction mechanisms, reaction pathways and reaction sites. Specifically, the structural evolution of surface-deficient catalysts often occurs before or simultaneously with the catalytic process, and the reconstructed structure usually acts as the true active site of the catalytic reaction. Therefore, surface defect sites are constantly changing during the catalytic phase rather than remaining constant, which requires the exploration of in situ characterization techniques to accurately track the actual catalytic process and active site changes, and to further investigate the impact of the dynamic evolution of defects during the catalytic process. In addition, for hydrogen spill phenomena, it is important to detect the presence of spilled hydrogen and how it interacts with the receptor, and the development of in situ characterization techniques has provided the impetus to monitor hydrogen spill effects in real time, including in situ powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), spatially resolved X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy combined with scanning tunneling microscopy (STM-TERS), super-resolution fluorescence microscopy, resonance photoemission spectroscopy, and surface plasmon spectroscopy. However, there is an immediate requirement to exploit advanced techniques for the direct detection of spilled hydrogen, which could provide more valuable information on the nature of the hydrogen species involved in the spill. Meanwhile, it is significant to develop characterization techniques capable of mapping transient chemical changes with improved spatial resolution down to a single site, which can be useful for the quantitative study of the spillover evolution. Thirdly, for the characterization of the CO2 electroreduction mechanism, advanced in situ characterization such as in situ HRTEM, in situ FTIR, in situ XAS and in situ Raman spectroscopy have been used to explain the mechanism. These in situ operational characterization techniques could be used to monitor actual CO2 reduction, clarify key intermediates formed during electrolysis and determine the reconstruction and activity point of the electrocatalyst. Additionally, the DFT theoretical calculations are commonly used to study the mechanism of CO2 reduction and provide the energetically optimal pathway to produce certain products. However, the models developed for DFT calculations are usually simplified models and the theoretical calculations are performed under ideal conditions. Some subtle changes in the electrode microenvironment, such as reconstruction of the electrocatalyst structure and local pH changes, are not taken into account during CO2 reduction calculations, which may play a key role in determining the CO2 reduction pathway. Therefore, the model structure and DFT calculations need to be rationalized taking into account the actual experimental environment. In conclusion, the combination of theoretical calculations and in situ characterization provides additional insight into the CO2 reduction mechanism, which is crucial for the rational design of electrocatalysts for efficient production performance. Finally, for CO2 photoreduction, characterization tools such as electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy, in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS), in situ electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and isotope labelling are used to analyze the mechanism. For example, in situ DRIFTS could provide reliable and decisive evidence for reaction intermediates and pathways in CO2 conversion and help explore reaction mechanisms. In situ Raman spectroscopy could monitor CO2 structural changes through vibrational spectroscopy, detect intermediates and identify possible major catalytic active sites. The isotopic labelling provides an effective method to infer plausible reaction pathways and identify the source of reaction products. The DFT calculations help to understand the energy band structure of the photocatalyst and the possible reaction pathways for CO2 reduction. In summary, more in situ characterization methods are expected to be developed and extended for investigating the catalytic processes, electron transfer, mass transfer and reaction kinetics of carbon sphere nanoreactors, and the resulting insights will help serve as stepping stones to clearly identify the nature of the catalytic sites and facilitate the further design of highly active catalysts for practical applications.
