Broader context
Zinc-based batteries have been extensively researched because of their high degree of safety, low cost, as well as the abundant sources and high volumetric energy density (5854 mA h cm−3) of the Zn metal. These merits endow ZBs with great potential in rechargeable energy storage for biocompatible electronics, which are employed in wearable and implantable devices, requiring the batteries to be of flexibility and biosecurity. However, there are still multiple challenges and issues that remain unsolved, hindering the practical applications of ZBs for biocompatible electronics.

1. Introduction
Biocompatible electronics has received extensive attention due to the rapid development of the electronic industry and the increasing demands from modernized lifestyles.1,2 Benefiting from the latest breakthroughs in novel designs and materials, various products have emerged and gradually integrated into human lives, enriching the quality of daily life.3 Biocompatible electronic devices are designed to fit with the human body,4 thus flexible components are essentially necessary5 and allows them to be deformable and stretchable when applied in different environments. Nowadays, biocompatible electronics are introduced to various aspects of modernized lifestyles, such as clothes and textiles, smart devices, sensors, and flexible displays (Fig. 1a).6

In the wide applications of biocompatible electronics, medical application should be one of the most significant fields. As shown in Fig. 1b, biocompatible electronics have been exploited for wearable and implantable devices, both of which can be used for medical applications. Generally, wearable medical devices refer to miniaturized electronics that can be worn on the human body and absorb effects for medical analyses7 and are commonly powered by rechargeable batteries, especially lithium-based batteries (LBs). A growing application of wearable devices is in health condition monitoring owing to their great potential in a wide range of physiological and clinical applications.8 The typical wearable devices employed for medical applications include heart monitoring, pulse monitoring, health recording, and smart bandages that can monitor wound conditions. Implantable medical devices are implanted into the body by invasive operations to treat medical conditions or monitor health states, including cardiac pacemakers, cardioverter-defibrillator, total artificial hearts, implantable nerve stimulators, cochlear implants, implantable bone growth stimulators, and implantable drug pumps.9 The long-term operation of permanently or semi-permanently implanted medical devices relies on rechargeable batteries to power the electronic circuitry for data acquisition, processing, and transmission. The most widely known example of implantable medical devices is the cardiac implant. In the 1960s, Dr William Chardack implanted a cardiac pacemaker into a 77-year-old man suffering from complete heart block.10 This procedure prolonged the life of this patient by 18 months and opened a new chapter for battery-powered implants. Nowadays, more than 3 million patients have a cardiac implanted electronic device such as a pacemaker or implanted cardioverter-defibrillator in the USA.11
It is known that energy storage is significant for electronic devices, of which the energy sources can be external power suppliers or other energy sources such as solar energy and biofuel cells. Energy storage devices occupy a major portion of the electronic devices in terms of size, weight, volume, and lifetime, demanding a higher level of biosecurity and reliability. Rechargeable batteries play an indispensable role in energy storage, as they exhibit high energy density and excellent stability.12 Among various battery systems, ZBs have attracted tremendous interest because of their low cost, high stability, high volumetric energy density, and abundant reserves.13–15 As one of the competitive substitutes of LBs, ZBs are endowed with many merits,16 and they additionally exhibit more advantages when facing the special demands from biocompatible electronics. As shown in Fig. 1c, the employment of non-noble materials (zinc foil, carbon-based materials, and inorganic salts) and aqueous electrolyte greatly reduce the assembly cost of ZBs. Additionally, the fast ion transport derived from the higher conductivity in aqueous media endows ZBs with excellent rate capability, which is very important for the quick charge technique. Various materials have been exploited as the cathode for rechargeable ZBs, including manganese-based, vanadium-based, and organic materials in the mildly acidic electrolyte,17 air cathode and other metal cathodes in alkaline electrolyte.18 Currently, LBs and supercapacitors are generally employed for biocompatible electronics.12 LBs are favored with unparalleled energy density, but they suffer from serious safety issues and higher costs of electrolytes. Supercapacitors are known to store energy by double layer capacitance, which provides excellent rate capability and cycling stability, and can operate in aqueous media. However, the biggest problem of supercapacitors is the low energy density. Compared with LBs and supercapacitors, ZBs are favored due to their high degree of safety, low cost, high capacity, and moderate energy density.19 However, in some situations, the alkaline electrolyte may lead to minor safety issues. Moreover, the flexible and safe components (hydrogel electrolyte and various current collectors) make biocompatible ZBs more competitive for biocompatible electronics.
According to recent marketing reports, the markets of biocompatible electronics will triple in growth by 2022 compared with 2016. As more biocompatible electronics have been employed in everyday life, safety issues have been put forward and are regarded as one of the major bottlenecks in their application.20 Since the 1960s, LBs have been used as energy storage systems for pacemakers and other implantable medical devices. In 1972, lithium-iodine battery-powered cardiac pacemakers were invented and used by Wilson Greatbatch. By far, it has become the most widely used energy storage system for implantable medical devices, successfully sustaining the pacemaker industry for 40 years. These batteries have the advantage of longevity (about 10 years). However, because of their inferior stability and the poor kinetics of iodine limiting their clinical usage,21 several new lithium-based chemistries have been exploited to replace the lithium–iodine batteries, including lithium–manganese dioxide,22 lithium-carbon monofluoride, and lithium–oxygen batteries.23 Despite the continual efforts to enhance the energy density and prolong the cycling lifetime, LBs still face limitations of integrating toxic and even flammable components, posing serious safety concerns.24 Although there are many media reports on the related public health safety risks, the literature studies describing battery-induced injuries are relatively sparse.
Broadly, the mechanisms for battery-induced injuries can be classified into four categories as follows: (i) physical pressure on the surrounding tissue that causes ischemic tissue necrosis, especially in tight cavities, such as nasal cavities, trachea, and others; (ii) generation of a local currency. The battery can spontaneously discharge current when contacting with moisture; (iii) an electric current passing through the tissues, resulting in direct current burns; (iv) leakage of battery contents, causing liquefaction necrosis and chemical burn. Battery ingestion, battery inhalation and battery explosion are the three major causes of hazardous effects. The data from the National Poison Data System (NPDS) show that the five-year battery ingestion has increased to 16870 cases (2015–2019) from 6206 cases (1985–1989) over the past 35 years. Moreover, the percentage of serious injury rate has increased to 5.06% from 0.53%. One major cause is that wearable devices powered by rechargeable batteries has become more widespread, leading to battery exposure and higher risk degree. Most of the ingested batteries are button batteries (coin cells). If ingested, button batteries may pass through the esophagus and gut, and finally discharge from the anus, which is the best-case scenario for battery ingestion (no effect). When batteries fail to pass out spontaneously, life-threatening complications can occur if batteries are not removed from the digestive tract exceeding 2 hours.25,26 Except for digestive tracts, batteries can be stuck in the respiratory tract or ear canal, leading to serious complications. Battery inhalation mainly happens to those who wear hearing-related devices,27 of which 663 cases were reported. The wearable battery-powered devices with a high risk of battery inhalation are hearing-aids (over 90%) and cochlear implants. A total of 49 cases with severe battery explosions have been reported by the medical literature and news. Battery explosion occurs mainly in adults (87.76%). E-cigarettes (75.51%, 37/49) and mobile phones (14.29%, 7/49) are also common devices with severe battery explosions.28,29 Battery explosion can occur when the device is in standby mode (53.06%, 26/49), running mode (22.45%, 11/49), or charging mode (20.41%, 10/49). Complications of battery explosion include skin burn (65.31%, 32/49), ocular burn (14.29%, 7/49), and oropharyngeal and palatal burns (6.12%, 3/49).30
Fortunately, facing the safety issues brought by rechargeable batteries, aqueous ZBs may be a suitable choice in energy storage for biocompatible electronics.31–34 In recent years, numerous papers have already demonstrated various designs for ZBs in flexible configurations.35,36 However, there are still few papers comprehensively reviewing ZBs for their applications and potential in biocompatible electronics (wearable and implantable devices), and providing future perspectives. This review focuses on biocompatible and safe ZBs for both wearable and implantable electronics. Recent progress and great research potential of ZBs for both wearable and implantable devices have been outlined with insights. To better align the future efforts, the existing challenges of biocompatible ZBs for large-scale applications are presented, followed by future roadmaps, including the evaluation criteria and design principles. This paper may be instructive for future investigations, and even the commercialization process of biocompatible ZBs.
2. Biocompatible ZBs for wearable and implantable devices
Batteries based on zinc metal anodes have received extensive attention in recent years. The emerging zinc-based battery systems include zinc–air batteries (ZABs),37 zinc–metal batteries (ZMBs),38 zinc–ion batteries (ZIBs),39 and other conversion reaction-based batteries, such as Zn–I2 batteries,40 Zn–Br2 batteries,41 and the electrolytic Zn–MnO2 batteries.42 Here, we present the schematic illustrations of these four types of ZBs, together with their energy storage mechanisms, advantages and disadvantages (Fig. 2). Based on various aspects of their properties, their potential for flexible electronics is elaborated. A summary of these battery systems is presented in Table 1.

A typical ZAB consists of three parts: Zn anode, alkaline electrolyte, and air cathode integrated with a bifunctional oxygen electrocatalyst. This battery operates through the electrochemical reaction between the Zn metal and O2 in an alkaline electrolyte: Cathode: O2 + 2H2O + 4e− ↔ 4OH−(1) Anode: Zn + 4OH− ↔ [Zn(OH4)]2− + 2e−(2) [Zn(OH4)]2− ↔ ZnO + 2OH− + H2O(3) Overall: 2Zn + O2 ↔ 2ZnO(4)
Taking the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) as the cathodic reactions, ZABs manage to provide a higher energy density. When assembled in a flexible configuration, ZABs are suitable for powering wearable devices. However, the air permeability may also result in CO2 absorption and the formation of insoluble carbonate.43 Additionally, the poor kinetics and expensive catalysts introduce more problems. Investigations on new electrolyte chemistry and cost-effective catalysts may contribute to future development.44
Depending on the reversible reaction of Zn/ZnO with a redox potential of −1.35 V vs. SHE, ZMBs can provide a high output voltage in an aqueous electrolyte (∼1.8 V for Zn–Ni/Co batteries).45 Here, the working mechanisms of ZMBs are presented below, with zinc–silver (Zn–Ag) batteries as the example: Cathode: Ag2O + H2O + 2e− ↔ 2Ag + 2OH−(5) Anode: Zn + 2OH− ↔ ZnO + H2O + 2e−(6) Overall: Zn + Ag2O ↔ ZnO + 2Ag(7)
Although the high output voltage and theoretical capacity bring prospects, the dendrite growth issues in alkaline electrolytes and the low usage rate of metal electrodes still limit the further development of ZMBs. Thus, the structural design of electrodes like Zn nanowires and other freestanding 3D architectures would contribute to flexible ZMBs.
ZIBs have become a popular research area in the last few years, of which the typical components are the Zn anode, neutral or mildly acidic electrolyte (usually ZnSO4), and intercalation-type cathode for most cases.17 There are various cathode materials that have been proposed for ZIBs, including manganese-based materials, vanadium-based materials, Prussian blue analogues, and organics. The energy storage mechanism of the cathodes in ZIBs is generally H+/Zn2+ co-insertion/extraction. In a typical Zn–MnO2 battery, the reaction process may be described as follows: Cathode: 2MnO2 + 2e− + Zn2+ ↔ ZnMn2O4(8) MnO2 + e− + H+ ↔ MnOOH(9) Anode: Zn ↔ Zn2+ + 2e−(10) Overall: 2MnO2 + Zn ↔ ZnMn2O2(11) 2MnO2 + Zn + 2H+ ↔ 2MnOOH + Zn2+(12)
Currently, manganese-based and vanadium-based materials are the most commonly used cathodes for ZIBs. Manganese-based materials like MnO2 provide a high reaction potential (usually 0.8–1.8 V), but suffer from poor cycling stability and rate capability.46 Vanadium-based materials provide a high capacity and good rate performance, but their lower reaction potential (usually 0.4–1.4 V) greatly limits the energy density.47 Additionally, both manganese-based and vanadium-based materials suffer from cathode dissolution, while the zinc anode issues in mildly acidic electrolytes also lead to cell degradation. Thus, much attention has been focused on the optimization strategies, like pre-intercalation and element doping for the cathode materials, surface coating and structural design for the anode.48 Considering the rapid development of ZIBs and applicable hydrogel electrolytes, they may be the strongest candidates for biocompatible ZBs.
Except for the above three types of battery systems, there are also many new conversion chemistries emerging as more attention has been paid to ZBs, of which Zn–I2 batteries and electrolytic Zn–MnO2 batteries are the representative battery systems. A typical electrolytic Zn–MnO2 battery is based on the reversible Mn2+/MnO2 reaction, described as follows: Cathode: MnO2 + 4H+ + 2e− ↔ Mn2+ + 2H2O(13) Anode: Zn ↔ Zn2+ + 2e−(14) Overall: MnO2 + Zn + 4H+ ↔ Mn2+ + Zn2+ + 2H2O(15)
Depending on the flexible current collectors and the cathode-free property, these conversion-type batteries would be especially promising for wearable and implantable devices. However, there are still some issues that need to be addressed. For Zn–I2 and Zn–Br2 batteries, the shuttling effect is one of the most serious issues, which leads to lower Coulombic efficiency and even cell failure.40 Fortunately, this problem can be addressed with the protective coating on zinc anode and proper solidifying agents for I2 and Br2.41 For electrolytic Zn–MnO2 batteries, the acidic electrolyte and following anode corrosion are the major problems.42 Owing to the proposal of acetate-based Mn2+/MnO2 chemistry, the electrolytic Zn–MnO2 could operate in a neutral environment, greatly contributing to their potential for flexible electronics.49 So far, there are only a few works reporting on conversion-type ZBs in flexible configurations. Thus, more attention should be paid to further explore their working mechanisms and future directions.
2.1. Wearable electronic devices
Generally, conventional coin cells are employed for the investigating process of ZBs.50 However, this configuration cannot fulfill the design principles of biocompatible batteries due to the liquid electrolyte and rigid stainless-steel cases. Thus, pushed by the need for flexible configurations and relying on the employment of sophisticated fabrication techniques and study of hydrogel electrolytes, considerable efforts have been devoted to developing novel architecture designs for flexible batteries. Here, the latest progress for various wearable battery systems and their relative merits are summarized in Table 2, in which the reported ZBs configurations can be divided into planar structure and cable structure (Fig. 3a).

The planar-structure ZBs (sandwich type and coplanar type) are widely applied because of their simple manufacturing process. The main components are current collectors, cathode, separator, electrolyte, and anode. The components for the sandwich structure are assembled layer-by-layer, followed by a packaging process.51 Usually, carbon-based materials (such as carbon cloth, carbon nanotube (CNT) paper, and free-stranding electrodes mixed with carbon materials) are employed as the current collectors for better flexibility and excellent electronic conductivity.52 Liquid electrolytes are abandoned because of their leakage under long-term deformation. In many cases, polymer substrate-based hydrogels are employed, and take the effects of both separator and electrolyte.53Fig. 3b presents the preparation process of a sandwiched ZAB with polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)-based hydrogel electrolyte.54 The electrolyte consisted of PVA and SiO2 while the air cathode was prepared by coating Co3O4 on a piece of carbon cloth, exhibiting great electrochemical performance and improved mechanical properties. The coplanar structure is achieved through printing interdigital anodes and cathodes on a single plane substrate, bringing enhanced bending tolerance and increasing the cell voltage by the in-series connection of multiple single-cells. The electrode materials can be easily harvested through the laser engraving process, or simply by printing the material powders on the current collectors to obtain the desired patterns. As presented in Fig. 3c, the Zn foil anode and the layered double hydroxide (LDH) cathode were fixed on the polyimide (PI) substrate, which were integrated with conductive copper tape and a piece of PVA electrolyte.55 This simple assembly method led to an operating voltage higher than 5 V with a series connection of three Zn–LDH batteries. As for the cable-structure ZBs, various configurations can be obtained based on the flexible fiber-like structures. Fig. 3d summarizes the most commonly employed configurations of cable structure ZBs: parallel type, twisted type, and coaxial type. Compared with the planar structure, cable structure ZBs possess the merits of compatibility with textile industry, air permeability, and better flexibility. However, there are also some shortcomings, such as high internal resistance, difficult fabrication, and higher requirements on hydrogels. Until now, several efforts have been aligned to achieve cable structure ZBs with better performance and simpler fabrication. Fig. 3e describes an in situ method to fabricate a coaxial polyaniline (PANI)-ZIB.56 The Zn anode was firstly electrodeposited on a commercial carbon cloth substrate, which was then immersed in the precursor solution to obtain the polyacrylamide (PAM) hydrogel electrolyte embedded electrode. The PANI outer layer was grown via the in situ chemical polymerization process to obtain the final coaxial ZIB. Fig. 3f shows the schematic illustration of a textile ZMB, consisting of a Zn anode, a Ni–Co bimetallic oxyhydroxide (BOH) cathode, and the PVA hydrogel electrolyte.45 This textile ZMB is soft and stretchable, being easily sewn on common clothes, which is especially of great potential in medical applications.
Flexible batteries for wearable devices have been investigated for years, and there are many emerging applications. For example, they can be employed for medical applications (such as heartbeat monitoring, pulse detection). Here, we present some examples of flexible batteries in various battery systems for wearable devices, which are instructive for the future applications of flexible ZBs. These are the Zn–Ag2O battery for biomonitoring patch (Fig. 3g),57 lithium-ion battery for medical/cosmetic patch with iontophoresis function (Fig. 3h),58 tattoo-type electrochemical sensors (Fig. 3i),50 ring-shape Zn-PANI battery for a photosensor (Fig. 3j),59 and Zn–MnO2 battery for a self-powered smartwatch (Fig. 3k).60 These applications indicate the great potential of flexible batteries for commercialization.
2.2. Implantable electronic devices
Compared with the widespread applications in various flexible and wearable electronics, there is relatively little research on batteries for implantable devices.61 Implanted electronics are significant in the field of medical applications, which have been mainly powered by LBs since the 1960s. In fact, ZBs may be more suitable for powering these devices due to their intrinsic safety. Unfortunately, there are few literature studies reporting ZBs for implantable electronics, most of which have not been validated with specific experiments. Here, we try to put forward the latest investigations on implantable energy storage devices (rechargeable batteries and supercapacitors) through presenting a summary of various implantable battery systems (Table 3). We also discuss the future potential of biocompatible ZBs for implantable electronics.

Implantable energy storage devices provide energy for implanted electronics, which are implanted into the body by invasive operations and take effects inside (Fig. 4a). Thus, it may be inconvenient to take the devices out of the body to recharge the batteries, which brings strict requirements on the stability and biocompatibility of the batteries. Different from the battery systems using organic electrolytes, aqueous batteries with intrinsically safe near-neutral electrolytes have larger advantages and are more suitable for powering implantable devices. Meanwhile, biodegradable materials have been widely employed in implantable electronics, especially for short-term operations, avoiding the troubles of surgical removal.12 Material candidates include biodegradable metals (e.g., Mg, Zn, Fe, W, Mo), dissolvable oxides (MoO3), and other biodegradable materials (polymers and hydrogels). Fig. 4b presents the degradation process of a supercapacitor, which is fabricated through a fully 3D printing technique with the activated carbon-contained ink and NaCl-based solid electrolyte.62 Low toxicity is another basic requirement. It should be recognized that LBs would lead to higher risk when employed inside the human body due to the high reactivity and organic electrolyte. It seems that the biofluids-based batteries/capacitors are preferred in view of safety issues, including sodium, potassium, and magnesium–ion batteries, of which the metal ions are already present inside the body.63 As presented in Fig. 4c, a fiber battery is proposed to be directly injected into the body with the support of biofluids with a mini-invasive syringe.64 The aqueous sodium-ion fiber battery employs the carbon nanotube hybrid fibers as the current collectors, on which Na0.44MnO2 and MoO3 are loaded as the cathode and anode, respectively. It is worth noting that no extra electrolyte is added. This is because the charge/discharge process of both scathode and anode would be based on Na+ (de)intercalation, which already exists in the internal environment. Except for the above issues, flexible configurations are also preferred for implantable energy storage devices. Fig. 4d presents the schematic illustrations of an all-hydrogel battery and its working mechanism.65 The electrodes of this all-hydrogel battery are dehydrated from a polyacrylamide (PAM)/carbon nanotube loaded with active materials (LiMn2O4 for the cathode and LiTi2(PO4)3 for the anode), which would rehydrate after being attached to the hydrogel electrolyte (based on LiCl). This tissue-like soft battery thoroughly eliminated the rigid components, and would be physically biocompatible to the body.

The above discussions of the implantable energy storage devices would contribute to the investigations on biocompatible ZBs for implant applications. As a kind of biodegradable material, the Zn metal would manage to operate inside the body, especially when miniaturized devices with higher energy density are required. It does bring some challenges that zinc salts do not naturally exist inside the body. Fortunately, the introduction of a dry electrolyte with preloaded salts enables the water-activated batteries with prolonged storage time, and allows for the performance to be relatively independent of the external biofluids environment.12 It should be noted that the Zn metal can be directly employed as the anode for ZBs, exhibiting much higher specific capacity and energy density than other anodes for ZBs, like intercalation-type anodes.53 In view of this, ZBs would be preferred since lithium and sodium metals should not be directly applied as the anodes for biocompatible batteries, considering the safety requirements. Moreover, the Zn metal can be loaded on various flexible current collectors, and thus become physically biocompatible with the body tissues. Based on the above merits, ZBs, and especially ZIBs and zinc–ion hybrid capacitors, deserve to be considered for future implantable energy storage.
3. Challenges and opportunities for biocompatible ZBs
Despite the merits of biocompatible ZBs for wearable and implantable electronics, challenges associated with the engineering designs and intrinsic electrochemistry of ZBs have also emerged when considering practical applications. Here, the existing issues facing the future practical applications have been elaborated. Based on the discussions, future roadmaps are proposed, including the rational evaluation criteria and design principles, to provide potential opportunities for biocompatible ZBs.
3.1 Challenges and issues

3.1.1 Dendrites issues. 
The generation of Zn dendrites during cycling is one of the main issues for ZBs when the Zn metal is employed as the anode,66,67 which seriously hinders the development of high-performance ZBs. Currently, this matter has hardly been investigated in flexible ZBs. In fact, the dendrites are even more serious in bending states due to the uneven electric field distribution (Fig. 5a).68 The serious challenge of the dendrites will lead to the accumulation of dead Zn, the risk of penetrating, and finally short circuit.69 Owing to the efforts paid, advances in several optimization strategies have mitigated the dendrite issues and the side reactions.70,71 The strategies regarding electrolytes include composition regulation and the design of penetrating-resistance hydrogel electrolytes (Fig. 5b). For example, the introduction of N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) was found to form hydrogen bonds with free water molecules, thus reducing the water reactivity and prolonging the lifetime.72 The solvation structure of Zn2+ can be modified through electrolyte composition regulation.73 Theoretically, the delayed desolvation process would result in the accumulation of desolvated Zn2+ in the electric double layer, resulting in more Zn nucleation sites.74 Such uniform Zn nucleation would help to suppress the Zn dendrite initiation and guide subsequent Zn deposition. The employment of the hydrogel electrolyte is not only the basic requirement of biocompatible ZBs as mentioned above, but also provides a simple method to avoid short-circuiting by dendrite penetration.75 The structural designs of both 3D Zn anode and current collectors are also effective in mitigating dendrites. Zn metal is densely encapsulated within the interspace among the networks, which suppresses the dendrite growth in the vertical direction.76 The porous skeleton leads to a homogeneous electric field distribution and homogeneous Zn2+ transport, providing more deposition sites and avoiding dendrite growth (Fig. 5c).

(g) Schematic illustrations of large-scale assembly for flexible batteries in planar and cable structures. 


3.1.2 Electrolyte leakage and package materials. 
The package is one of the main components of batteries, but related investigations have hardly been presented. There is also no consensus on the proper package materials for biocompatible batteries. Currently, the Al-plastic film is employed for some pouch cells, which may be insufficiently flexible for the practical application of biocompatible ZBs. Generally, stretchable and robust package materials are demanded for biocompatible batteries to avoid package damage, which may lead to electrolyte leakage (ion exchange between the hydrogel electrolyte and body tissue fluid) and current leakage, damaging the human tissues (Fig. 5d). Moreover, the permeation of water and oxygen are known to be devastating for LBs.77 As shown in Fig. 5e, ideal package materials should be soft and of low permeability.
Fortunately, in the case of ZBs, higher air permeability could be acceptable due to the air-stable components, leaving more choices for package materials. In fact, air permeability (mainly oxygen) is one of the necessary requirements for ZABs, of which the cathodic reactions are OER and ORR.54 However, the CO2 invasion would lead to electrolyte loss and the formation of insoluble carbonate in an alkaline environment. On the other hand, considering the employment of hydrogels in most cases for flexible batteries, water-retaining capability should also be highlighted to avoid the increasing resistance derived from water evaporation.78 Thus, it is a significant direction to design oxygen-permeable and water/CO2-resistant components for biocompatible ZBs, especially ZABs and ZMBs.79 The waterproof and breathable membrane can be obtained by adding hydrophobic fillers, such as hydrophobic SiO2,80 which greatly prolongs the lifetime of the metal–air battery. An interphase layer in the cathode side not only mitigates the water loss, but also suppresses the dendrite growth,81 which combines the optimization strategies towards a stable zinc anode and long-lifetime hydrogel electrolyte. These strategies would contribute to further investigations towards the rational design of the package and relevant materials for biocompatible ZBs.


3.1.3 Challenges for practical applications. 
So far, the assembly and performance tests of biocompatible ZBs are mainly conducted on a laboratory scale. Thus, there are also issues remaining that have hardly been considered for practical applications. Hydrogel dehydration should be considered because an ordinary hydrogel would lose water content when placed in an open environment, leading to poor contact with the electrodes and a larger resistance (Fig. 5f). This matter will be magnified when facing long-term transportation and storage in practical applications. A feasible optimization is to improve the water retention capability of the hydrogel materials, and ensure longer periods of validity. Moreover, producing the hydrogel substrate and electrolyte separately may also be effective. These can be hydrated before assembly, bringing lower cost and fewer efforts. However, this may be ineffective for the hydrogels that are unable to be rehydrated. Thus, specific investigations would be especially significant. For example, in situ investigations may contribute to a deeper understanding of the dehydration process of hydrogels in the ambient environment.
Large-scale assembly is another problem. Complex processes and expensive ingredients are usually involved in some situations of lab research, which lead to some inapplicable issues when considering the excessively long period and high cost for commercial application. Thus, both high performance and cost effectiveness should be taken into consideration for ideal battery systems. Fortunately, many automating strategies have been proposed for the large-scale assembly of flexible batteries under constant investigations from the pioneers. The batteries in the coplanar structure are known to be easily assembled in series by laser cutting or ink printing. Sandwiched batteries can be assembled in roll-to-roll casting and calendaring equipment (Fig. 5g).82 A similar technique was exploited for cable-structure batteries, which is based on the solution-extrusion method: the electrode and electrolyte inks would be simultaneously extruded from separated storage tanks into a coagulation bath, in which the hydrogels solidify and wrap the anode and cathode to obtain the flexible battery.61 During the above assembling process, several parameters should be controlled to present ideal regulations. For example, an excessively large tensile force may result in material fracture, and the lower viscosity of the inks would have an impact on the solidifying and shaping process.83

3.2 The future roadmaps
Despite the existing challenges and issues discussed above, the higher degree of safety, lower cost, and excellent performance compared with LBs and other battery systems still endow biocompatible ZBs with a promising future. Here, the future roadmaps are presented, including the validation, evaluation criteria, and design principles of biocompatible ZBs.

3.2.1 Energy density and power density. 
Batteries play an indispensable role in implantable devices and account for most of the weight. Thus, it is important to improve the energy density of batteries for miniaturized devices. Taking no account of the cathode materials temporarily, there are more issues in biocompatible ZBs compared with ordinary ZBs containing liquid electrolytes. Fig. 6a presents the schematic of the anode–electrolyte interface. Deriving from the intrinsic issues of the hydrogel electrolyte, the biocompatible ZBs are suffering from low ionic conductivity (Fig. 6b) and poor contact between the electrodes and electrolyte (Fig. 6c),68,84 leading to larger resistance, poor rate capability and lower energy density. Moreover, the excessive use of Zn metal will increase the overall weight of the battery and aggravate the side reactions (Fig. 6d).

Reprinted with permission.101 Copyright 2022, Oxford University Press. 
Several optimization strategies have been proposed to address the above issues. For example, graphene oxide was introduced to improve the ionic conductivity of the PVA hydrogel electrolyte by facilitating the ion transport (Fig. 6e).85 In flexible configurations, the bending states will give rise to component slippage, leading to the contact loss between the electrolyte and electrodes (Fig. 6f). Thus, it is important to employ adhesive hydrogels when designing flexible batteries. Applying current collectors is a feasible measure to deal with the increased cost and aggravated side reactions derived from excess Zn. For example, carbon-based materials could provide a large specific surface area and good electronic conductivity. Additionally, the use of current collectors will lead to higher energy density by improving the utilization ratio of the active materials (Fig. 6g).


3.2.2 Validation of biocompatibility. 
Biocompatible ZBs are designed to be close to the human body, especially for implantable batteries. Thus, it is necessary to apply rational validation and strict evaluation before their usage on the human body. Generally, the following procedures should be followed to obtain valid biocompatible ZBs: rational material design, precise device assembly, strict in vivo tests on animals, and practical applications in the human body (Fig. 7a). The basic requirements of implantable batteries on biocompatibility include stability (for long-term operation) and degradability (for short-term operation). When it is necessary to operate the battery inside the body (Fig. 7b) for a long period, the stability should be reconsidered, including the cycling stability and in vivo stability. The in vivo stability indicates that the implantation will trigger no immune response and the battery can stably operate inside the body (Fig. 7c), while the cycling stability ensures that the battery provides enough energy for the device (Fig. 7d). Biodegradable materials are employed for the implantable battery when a short-term operation is required, avoiding its extraction by invasion operation. Two degradation routes have been proposed for biodegradable materials (Fig. 7e), including partial degradation and complete degradation.86 As for the specific degradation mechanisms, different materials are degraded through different processes. Metals and oxides degrade mainly through the dissolution reaction, and the polymers degrade through different mechanisms based on their groups (Fig. 7f).87

3.2.3 Rational evaluation criteria. 
Currently, the flexibility tests of biocompatible ZBs are generally in the initial stage, which lack unified evaluation criteria. To rationally evaluate the flexibility, parameters should be introduced to describe the bending states. As shown in Fig. 8a, the device length (L), bending radius (R), and bending angle (θ) are introduced to describe the bending degree during battery cycling. Softness (unit: mm) is another parameter to evaluate flexibility through the softness tester.53Fig. 8b presents the softness of different current collectors for the electrodes of ZBs. Carbon-based current collectors endow the electrodes with higher softness, compared with ordinary stainless steel foil and Zn foil. The residual strain was proposed to describe the deformation irreversibility of flexible devices. Fig. 8c summarizes the residual strains of different hydrogel electrolytes after 100 stretching cycles with a maximum strain of 200%, and all hydrogel electrolytes exhibited remarkable residual strain. The influence of the residual strain on the cycling stability was tested with a Zn–MnO2 battery (Fig. 8d). Moreover, the general testing methods on flexibility are summarized in Fig. 8e, including twisting, bending, and compressing, in which the ideal configurations are presented on the left.78

3.2.4 Design principles of biocompatible ZBs. 
To better align the efforts of future investigations and contribute to the development of biocompatible ZBs, the design principles are proposed here. The basic demand towards biocompatibility includes flexibility and biosecurity, corresponding to wearable devices and implantable devices, respectively. The electrochemical performance of biocompatible ZBs should also be investigated, including the enhancement of the energy density and power density, mitigation of the anode issues, and improving the cycling stability.
The excellent flexibility raises requests on the materials of the electrolyte and current collector. The hydrogel electrolyte is generally employed in biocompatible ZBs, which need to operate in different states (stretching, bending, and twisting, Fig. 9a). In order to adapt to complex working conditions, there are various hydrogel materials with different structures as the electrolyte substrate, including hydrogels without cross-linking (PVA, carboxymethyl cellulose, xanthan gum), with physical cross-linking (gelatin), and with chemical cross-linking (PAM).84 These hydrogels are also separated into natural biomass hydrogels, synthetic porous hydrogels, and oxide hydrogels.88 Natural biomass gels are usually derived from polysaccharide and protein harvested from plants, animals, and micro-organisms, which form the gel networks by electrostatic force, hydrogen bonding, or combination with hydrophilic groups. Due to the high ionic conductivity and low cost, synthetic porous hydrogels are ideal materials as the electrolyte for biocompatible ZBs, including PAM and PVA. Oxide hydrogels are formed by metal oxide (like ZnO and CuO) absorbing water, of which the ionic conductivity is greatly affected by the water content and is expected to be further investigated. Generally, hydrogels with higher softness and toughness are preferred for better flexibility. Adhesive hydrogels are effective in addressing the contact loss between the electrode and electrolyte,89 which not only avoid the slippage during battery deformation, but also endow the battery with the self-healing and recovering ability after being damaged by external forces.90 These adhesive hydrogels are developed based on hydrogen bonding, guest-host interaction, and topological adhesion. Carbon-based materials (e.g., carbon cloth, graphene paper, CNT paper) are ideal choices for the current collector owing to their high conductivity, large specific surface area, and favorable flexibility. The active material could be loaded on the current collector by electrodeposition, and pre-synthesized materials would be mixed with the current collector (powder or short fiber) and binder, which can be printed directly on the substrate (such as PI) (Fig. 9b).82 The composition proportion of the current collector (conductive agent) should be adjusted according to the intrinsic conductivity of the active material.

(e) Nanosizing and morphology regulation of the electrodes. (f) Enhancing conductivity and good contact. (g) Optimization strategies for anode issues. (h) Cathode issues and strategies toward cycling stability. 
Facing the requirement of implantable devices, the biosecurity of biocompatible ZBs is significant. However, in practical situations, reaching the ideal situation that all battery components are biocompatible may be sometimes unrealistic. In these situations, different requirements towards biosecurity are needed for different applications. For the implantable devices of short-term use (a few weeks or months) with the biodegradable components, the biodegradation process should be conducted after the service term (Fig. 9c). Thus, the battery should be designed to biodegrade after a specific period, avoiding losing effects too early. The residues without biodegradability should be nontoxic and ultimately be excreted outside the body. For long-term implanted devices (permanent or semi-permanent devices) (Fig. 9d), the biosecurity requirement on various battery components could be properly lowered. Generally, internal components of the implanted battery (like electrolytes and electrodes) may not directly contact the tissues and body liquids, except for the worst situation of package damage. In view of this, some ingredients with other functions would be approved, including electrolyte additives and other organic components. However, it would bring more restrictive requirements on package materials to ensure safe operations. Currently, relevant regulations and principles regarding these issues are lacking, which should be further investigated towards the application field of implantable ZBs and other batteries.
Electrochemical performance is equally important for biocompatible ZBs, in which high energy density and power density are favored, especially when miniaturized devices are required. It is essential to improve the energy density through reducing the whole weight and enhancing the energy contribution. In a battery system with fixed components, efficient utilization of the active material and lower cell resistance would lead to higher energy density and power density. As shown in Fig. 9e, nanosizing the active material and regulating the morphology of the electrodes are beneficial to the efficient utilization by increasing the contact area and shortening the ion diffusing path. To reduce the cell resistance, the optimizations on the hydrogel electrolytes could be greatly effective because of the intrinsic poor ionic conductivity and imperfect contact between the electrolytes and electrodes. Thus, conductive additives, higher water content, electrode modification and the adhesive hydrogel may achieve higher energy density and power density (Fig. 9f). Moreover, the Zn metal anode issues are still serious in biocompatible ZBs, including dendrite, corrosion, hydrogen evolution, and passivation.91 Although employing the hydrogel electrolyte may mitigate the anode issues, integrating multiple optimization strategies may be more effective and should be applied in biocompatible ZBs.92 The reported strategies consist of surface coating, structural design, electrolyte regulation, and zinc alloying (Fig. 9g). Cycling stability is vital for biocompatible ZBs to provide a longer lifetime. In addition to anode issues, the cycling stability is limited by the cathode materials, which suffer from the structure collapse, cathode dissolution, and shuttling effect (Fig. 9h).93 Several strategies toward more stable cathode materials have been reported, such as the cation pre-intercalation to stabilize the layer-structure cathode.94 These strategies should also be effective for biocompatible ZBs.

4. Summary and outlook
In this review, starting with the battery-induced injuries and related safety issues, biocompatible ZBs are proposed to fulfill the demands of energy storage for flexible electronics. The latest progress in various wearable and implantable battery systems has been presented, which provides references for the investigations on the early-stage biocompatible ZBs and indicates the potential directions. Moreover, the emerging challenges and issues facing the practical applications are presented, including dendrite issues, electrolyte leakage, hydrogel dehydration, and large-scale assembly. The future roadmaps are also discussed, including the rational design, assessment criteria, validation of biocompatible ZBs towards flexibility, biosecurity, and excellent electrochemical performance. Based on the above discussions, several issues deserve to be reconsidered in order to better fulfill the requirements for practical applications and commercialization:
(1) More attention to the substrate materials of hydrogels. As one of the necessary components in biocompatible ZBs, special attention must be paid to design more intrinsically conductive, robust, and adhesive hydrogels, instead of only focusing on the modification and additives on electrolyte composition.
(2) Rational design of the current collector. To achieve better flexibility and higher electronic conductivity, the use of a current collector is necessary for both the anode and cathode in biocompatible ZBs. Thus, the material, structure, and optimizations of the current collector should be reconsidered.
(3) More systematic performance evaluation. The inconsistent evaluation criterion is always a problem when assessing the performance of flexible batteries, hindering the fair comparison between candidates. Here, we suggest using parameters to describe the bending states of flexible batteries in order to establish unified testing standards.
(4) Strict validation on biocompatibility. For devices employed close to the human body, especially implantable devices, security and stability should be considered simultaneously, which should be verified with experimental animals in advance. It should be noted that stability should not be indicated only by cycling stability, since in vivo stability may be even more significant for permanently implanted devices.
(5) Integration into various devices. Coupling biocompatible ZBs with the target devices should be highlighted. This has hardly been investigated, but hinders the commercialization process. In fact, there may be even more problems emerging when considering the coordinated operation of different components, which should be considered in advance.
As an emerging low-cost energy storage technique for biocompatible electronics, the development of biocompatible ZBs is still in a relatively young stage. Continued efforts focusing on the above discussions would contribute to a more promising future, promoting the investigation on biocompatible ZBs with ensured flexibility, biosecurity, and better electrochemical performance. The perspectives and insights contained in this review would be beneficial to better aligning the efforts toward further exploiting biocompatible ZBs.

Broader context
Zinc-based batteries have been extensively researched because of their high degree of safety, low cost, as well as the abundant sources and high volumetric energy density (5854 mA h cm−3) of the Zn metal. These merits endow ZBs with great potential in rechargeable energy storage for biocompatible electronics, which are employed in wearable and implantable devices, requiring the batteries to be of flexibility and biosecurity. However, there are still multiple challenges and issues that remain unsolved, hindering the practical applications of ZBs for biocompatible electronics. This review presents the recent progress and developing potential of biocompatible ZBs for wearable and implantable devices. Challenges and corresponding solutions are also discussed for future investigations, followed by the roadmaps towards biocompatible and safe ZBs. Additionally, the design principles for flexibility, biosecurity, and better electrochemical performance are summarized in detail.
