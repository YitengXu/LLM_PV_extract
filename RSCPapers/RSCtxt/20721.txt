    , Accepted 20th March 2016First published on 21st March 2016AbstractFour acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) small molecules with dihydroindoloindole (DINI) as the central donor unit and different acceptor end groups such as dicyanovinylene (DCV), indenedione (IND), cyanoacrylate (CA) and rhodanine (Rho) linked through bithiophene as the π-linker, DINI-DCV, DINI-IND, DINI-CA and DINI-Rho, were designed and synthesized for the application as donor materials along with PC71BM as an acceptor for solution processed organic bulk heterojunction solar cells. The effect of acceptor end groups on the photovoltaic performance was investigated. The organic solar cells (OSCs) based on as cast DINI-IND showed the highest power conversion efficiency of 3.04%, as cast DINI-CA showed the lowest PCE of 1.63% and the other two exhibit a PCE in between them. These results showed that acceptor end groups affect the overall performance of the cells. The PCE of OSCs has been further improved up to 7.04% and 6.16% employing two-step annealing (TSA) treated DIN-IND:PC71BM (1:2) and DIN-CN:PC71BM (1:2), respectively. The enhancement in the PCE of OSCs with TSA treated active layers is attributed to the better nanophase morphology, the increase in the crystalline nature and light harvesting efficiency and more balanced charge transport and charge collection probability.
Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) based on bulk heterojunction (BHJ) active layers have been attracting a lot of attention from both academic and industrial communities because they are cost effective and flexible solar energy to electrical energy conversion devices.1 Significant progress has been made in recent years and power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) over 9–10% using single layer polymer BHJ solar cells have been reported2 after the optimization of donor–acceptor ratios, choice of solvent, solvent and thermal annealing and interface engineering. In contrast to conjugated polymers, conjugated small molecules possess advantages such as simple synthesis, purification, defined molecular structures and molecular weights without batch to batch variation.3 After the optimization of the molecular structure and morphology of BHJ active layers, the PCE of the OSCs has been improved from 0.03% to 9–10%.4 The π-conjugated small molecules built up from alternating electron-rich donor (D) and electron-poor acceptor (A) segments provide excellent materials with strong charge transfer character, absorption in the visible to near-infrared region, a highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO)–lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy gap, and good charge carrier mobility.5 Among them, acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) conjugated small molecules were developed and used as donors for solution processed organic solar cells.6 The electronic levels and solubility of these small molecules can be controlled by proper substitution and functionalization which not only lead to broad absorption in the solar spectrum, but also a high open circuit voltage and excellent stability towards oxidation.
In the design of new small molecules as electron donors for OSCs, basic properties such as energy levels, charge transport, and absorption are the parameters to be considered. Aromatic fused rings have been extensively used to design the high mobility organic semiconductors because the extended conjugation in fused rings is beneficial to form effective interchain π–π overlaps and enhance the charge transport,7 leading to the high charge carrier mobility.8 Moreover, the extended π-conjugation also leads to enhancement of the delocalization of π-electrons to attain an effective π-conjugation length, thereby reducing the bandgap.9
Dihydroindoloindole (DINI) is an electron rich planar aromatic fused structure with two nitrogen atoms, which can be easily substituted with alkyl chains for better solubility of the small material. Owczarczyk et al. reported DINI based polymers and showed that DINI is an effective backbone for polymer solar cell (PSC) applications.10 Kranthiraja et al. have also reported the fabrication of BHJ PSCs employing a DINI based D–A copolymer, achieving a PCE of 1.68%.11 Although DINI has interesting characteristics, small molecules based on DINI have not been employed for the fabrication of small molecule BHJ solar cells. We have synthesized a series of A–D–A small molecules with the same dihydroindoloindole (DINI) as the central donor unit and different acceptor end groups such as dicyanovinylene (DCV), indenedione (IND), cyanoacrylate (CA) and rhodanine (Rho) linked through a bithiophene linker and investigated their optical and electrochemical properties. We have used these small molecules as donor layers along with PC71BM as an acceptor and varied the donor to acceptor weight ratio and found that a weight ratio of 1:2 showed the best photovoltaic performance. The OSCs fabricated using optimized DINI-CA:PC71BM, DINI-DCV:PC71BM, DINI-Rho:PC71BM and DINI-IND:PC71BM spin cast from DCB showed PCEs of 1.63%, 2.53%, 2.13% and 3.04%, respectively. Therefore, different acceptor end groups of these small molecules lead to variation in the PCE of OSCs. In order to improve the PCE further, we have employed a simple TSA (combined thermal annealing and subsequent solvent vapor annealing) treatment of active layers and the PCE has been improved significantly (7.04% and 6.16% for DINI-IND:PC71BM and DINI-DCV:PC71BM, respectively) due to a better nanophase morphology, crystallinity, molecular packing and light harvesting ability of active layers. These combined properties enhance the exciton generation efficiency and lead to relatively better balanced charge transport, resulting in improvement in Jsc, FF and PCE of the resultant OSCs.

Device fabrication and characterization
The small molecule BHJ OSCs were fabricated with a configuration of ITO coated glass/PEDOT:PSS/donors:PC71BM/Al using a conventional solution spin coating method. The indium tin oxide (ITO) coated glass substrates were cleaned subsequently by ultrasonic treatment in detergent, deionized water, acetone and isopropyl alcohol for 20 min. A layer of PEDOT:PSS was spin coated (3500 rpm, ∼40 nm) onto ITO coated glass substrates and baked at 120 °C for 20 min. The active layer was spin coated onto the top of the PEDOT:PSS layer with different weight ratios of donors and PC71BM in dichlorobenzene (DCB) at 1500 rpm for 25 s. For two-step annealing (TSA) treatment, the optimized active layer was thermally annealed by placing the active layer on a hot plate at 110 °C for 5 min and then cooled up to room temperature. For the subsequent solvent vapor annealing (SVA), the active layer was placed in a glass Petri dish containing 200 μL of THF. The thickness of the active layer is about 90 ± 5 nm. Finally, a 50 nm aluminum (Al) layer was deposited onto the top of the active layer under high vacuum using a shadow mask. The effective area of each device is about 20 mm2. The hole-only and electron-only devices with ITO/PEODT:PSS/active layer/Au and ITO/Al/active layer:PC71BM/Al architectures were also fabricated in an analogous manner in order to measure the hole and electron mobility, respectively. The current–voltage characteristics of BHJ organic solar cells were measured using a computer controlled Keithley 238 source meter under simulated AM1.5G, 100 mW cm−2. A xenon light source coupled with an optical filter was used to give the stimulated irradiance at the surface of the devices. The incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE) of the devices was measured by illuminating the devices using the light source and monochromator and the resulting current was measured using a Keithley electrometer under short circuit conditions.
Results and discussion
Optical and electrochemical properties
The normalized absorption spectra of the four small molecules in dilute DCB solution and thin films are shown in Fig. 1a and b, respectively. The corresponding data are summarized in Table 1. All the small molecules showed two absorption bands covering the wavelength range from 350 to 650 nm. The absorption bands in high energy and low energy wavelength regions are attributed to localized π–π* transitions and intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) transitions between the central donor and terminal acceptor units, respectively. It can be seen from Fig. 1a that the absorption peak assigned to the high energy band for all small molecules is almost the same, but the absorption peak assigned to ICT bands is different due to the different electron accepting ability of end group units. The bathochromic shift following the trend DINI-IND > DINI-DCV > DINI-Rho > DINI-CA is in agreement with the electron accepting ability trend IND > DCV > Rho > CA. This indicates that the small molecule having a stronger electron withdrawing moiety exhibits a red-shift in absorption spectra due to its stronger ICT.12 The absorption spectra of all small molecules in thin films show broad and bathochromic shifts of ICT absorption bands compared to their corresponding solution spectra, indicating that these molecules follow J aggregates in the film state and increased intermolecular interactions and backbone planarity in the solid state.13 Moreover, all the small molecules showed a vibronic shoulder, indicating the existence of strong π–π stacking between the molecular backbones. The optical bandgaps of these small molecules were estimated from the absorption edges in thin film spectra of the corresponding small molecules to be 1.78 eV, 1.95 eV, 1.74 eV, and 1.88 eV for DINI-DCV, DINI-CA, DINI-IND, and DINI-Rho, respectively.

The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level of SMs was estimated from the onset oxidation potential in the corresponding cyclic voltammogram (shown in Fig. S13, ESI†) with the assumption that the energy level of ferrocene (Fc) was 4.8 eV below the vacuum level. The LUMO energy level of the small molecules was estimated according to ELUMO = EHOMO + E0–0, where E0–0 is determined from the intersection of absorption and emission spectra in solution (as shown in Fig. S14, ESI†). The estimated HOMO/LUMO energy levels for small molecules are compiled in Table 1. It is well known that the HOMO and LUMO energy levels are affected by the electron donating and withdrawing units in D–A type compounds, respectively. A similar value of the LUMO energy level for DINI-DCV and DINI-IND indicates that DCV and IND have almost the same electron withdrawing ability. The LUMO energy level of these small molecules is sufficiently higher than the LUMO energy level of PC71BM (−4.1 eV), indicating that efficient photoinduced charge separation is possible and it can be used as a donor for BHJ organic solar cells.

Fig. 2 shows the optimized structures of DINI-CA, DINI-Rho, DINI-DCV and DINI-IND, which are calculated by the time dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) using the B3LYP functional/3-21 G* basis set. The HOMO densities of these small molecules are similarly observed in both DINI and the thiophene bridge. However, the LUMO is located predominantly in the different electron accepting end group units and the thiophene bridge, showing a general orbital distribution of D–A small molecules.

Photovoltaic properties
In order to achieve high PCE of organic BHJ solar cells, there should be a balance between the absorbance and charge transport ability of active layers. The weight ratio of small molecule donors and PC71BM was varied from 1:05 to 1:2.5 and devices with a ratio of 1:2 showed the maximum PCE. The current–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the BHJ organic solar cells based on DINI-DCV, DINI-CA, DINI-Rho and DINI-IND as donors and PC71BM as an acceptor with an optimized D/A weight ratio (1:2) are shown in Fig. 3a. The corresponding photovoltaic parameters are compiled in Table 2. The device based on DINI-IND:PC71BM showed the highest PCE of 3.04% with Jsc of 7.20 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.88 V and FF of 0.48, whereas the device based on DINI-CA:PC71BM showed the lowest PCE of 1.63% with Jsc of 4.98 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.78 V and FF of 0.42. It can be seen from Table 2 that the device based on DINI-DCV showed the highest Voc, due to the its deeper HOMO level compared to others, since Voc of the BHJ OSCs is directly related to the difference between the LUMO of the acceptor and the HOMO of the donor used in the active layer. The variation of Jsc of the OSCs is consistent with the absorption spectra of the active layer and IPCE spectra of the devices (Fig. 4). The Jsc values estimated from the integration of the IPCE spectra are compiled in Table 2 and matched with the Jsc values obtained from measurements of J–V characteristics.

The low values of PCE based on these small molecules are mainly attributed to the low values of both Jsc and FF and related to the poor morphology of the active layer, since the nanoscale phase separation is needed for the efficient exciton dissociation and charge transport. A two-step annealing (TSA) approach that combines thermal and solvent vapor annealing has been adopted to tune the morphology of the active layer using polymers and small molecules as donors14 and it has been found that the PCE is significantly improved. We have examined the effect of TSA for devices employing all the small molecules and found that all the devices showed an increase in PCE (see Table 2), but DINI-DCV and DINI-IND showed higher PCEs than the other two molecules. Therefore, we have discussed the effect of TSA only for the devices based on DINI-DCV and DINI-IND in detail and the J–V characteristics of these devices at an illumination intensity of 100 mW cm−2 are shown in Fig. 5a. The PCE was improved up to 7.04% (Jsc = 12.18 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.85 V and FF = 0.68) and 6.16% (11.74 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.86 V and FF = 0.61) for DINI-IND and DINI-DCV, respectively, with remarkably enhanced Jsc and FF. The significant improvement in PCE originates from the favorable morphological evolution in the active layer induced by the combined effect of thermal and solvent vapor annealing. The IPCE spectra of the devices are shown in Fig. 5b. The IPCE peak of both DINI-DCV and DINI-IND significantly enhanced after the TSA treatment (see Fig. 3b and 5b), contributing to higher Jsc. Moreover, the IPCE spectra of the devices based on the TSA treated active layers show broader response and red-shift as compared to the devices without TSA, which is consistent with their absorption spectra (Fig. 4). The increase in the absorption intensity and broadening of the absorption profile of blended films towards a longer wavelength region upon TSA treatment may be related to the improved π–π stacking and planarity of the donor.

To know the reason behind the improvement in the PCE of the devices by the TSA treatment, X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were applied to explore the molecular packing in these active layers (Fig. 6). As shown in Fig. 6, as cast DINI-DCV:PC71BM and DINI-IND:PC71BM films show a weak (100) diffraction peak located at 2θ = 3.96° and 4.22°, corresponding to a d-spacing of 2.33 nm and 2.18 nm, respectively, between the molecular layers. This suggests that DINI-IND forms a denser molecular packing than the DINI-DCV counterpart which may induce a better nano-phase separation between the donor and the acceptor in the as cast blend films and may be responsible for a higher PCE of the device based on DINI-IND. After TSA, the (100) peak shifts to 2θ = 4.26° and 4.45° for DINI-DCV and DINI-IND, respectively, and also becomes much stronger, indicating an improved layered packing of molecules existing in the active layer. The increased diffraction intensity of TSA treated blended films indicates that the degree of crystallinity is significantly improved as compared to the as cast counterpart. The combined effect of thermal annealing and subsequent solvent vapor annealing promotes the nanoscale morphology in the active layer for efficient charge transfer and transportation, resulting in an improvement in Jsc and FF.

The morphological change in the active layer with TSA treatment has been further investigated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Fig. 7 shows the TEM images of DIN-DCV:PC71BM and DIN-IND:PC71BM blended films with and without TSA treatment. The bright and dark regions correspond to donors and PC71BM domains, respectively.15 The blended films cast from CB showed a very uniform and homogeneous morphology, owing to the good miscibility of donors and PC71BM. The desirable nano-phase morphology with separated donor and acceptor domains is not observed, resulting in low Jsc and FF and overall PCE. However, upon TSA treatment of the active layer, the domain size of both the donor and PC71BM becomes bigger and a nanoscale phase separation is achieved as shown in Fig. 7, consequently leading to a significant improvement in the photovoltaic performance of devices.

On organic solar cells using BHJ active layers, hole and electron mobilities are important parameters to ensure the efficient charge carrier transport towards the electrodes and to suppress the photocurrent loss by competing charge recombination. Moreover, balance between the hole and electron mobilities in the active layer is also important for improving the Jsc and FF of the OSCs. The hole mobilities of the blended films with and without TSA were measured by the space charge limited current method,16 with the hole-only device structure ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/Au, as shown in Fig. 8. The hole mobilities are 0.98 × 10−5 and 1.45 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 for as cast DINI-DCV and DIN-IND, respectively. After the TSA, the mobilities increase to 8.98 × 10−5 and 1.16 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for DINI-DCV and DIN-IND, respectively. We have also measured the electron mobilities using the electron-only device structure ITO/Al/active layer/Al using the same SCLC method and found that electron mobilities are in the range of 2.42–2.48 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for both the as cast and TSA treated blended films. The relatively unbalanced carrier mobilities (electron to hole mobility ratios are 24.69 and 16.7 for DINI-DCV and DIN-IND, respectively) for the as cast films can be ascribed to the poor morphology which results in a lower photovoltaic performance. The increase in hole mobility in the blend films with the TSA treatment leads to more balanced charge transport (electron to hole mobilities are 2.76 and 2.14 for DINI-DCV and DIN-IND, respectively), enhancing the FF and overall PCE. The high hole mobility and better charge transport for the devices processed with TSA treated active layers are consistent with the increase in crystallinity of the active layers and molecular packing as illustrated by XRD and TEM measurements. Therefore, TSA treatment resulted in much enhanced hole mobility together with considerably better balanced hole and electron mobility which led to a much higher charge carrier extraction efficiency and was thus responsible for higher FF.17 The DINI-IND:PC71BM based device achieved an FF value of 0.68, which may be associated with its high and balanced charge carrier mobility as well as lower charge recombination losses.18

The relationship between the photocurrent (Jph) and effective voltage (Veff) was investigated for the devices with and without TSA treated DINI-DCV:PC71BM and DINI-IND:PC71BM layers and is shown in Fig. 9. Here, Jph is defined as Jph = JL − JD, where JL and JD are the current densities under illumination and in the dark, respectively, and Veff = V0 − Vappl, where V0 is the voltage at which Jph = 0 and Vappl is the applied voltage.19 In the devices based on the TSA treated active layers, Jph shows a linear dependence at low Veff and is saturated at high Veff. The devices based on the active layers without TSA treatment also showed a linear Jph–Veff dependence at low values of Veff, but do not fully saturate even at high voltage. The Veff value corresponds to an internal electric field to sweep out the photogenerated charge carriers in the active layer towards the electrodes. It means that a much stronger electric field is required to sweep out photogenerated charges and suggests relatively poor charge transport within the active layer. It is consistent with the absence of ordered domains to provide effective percolation pathways for charge carriers in the active layer. The saturation current density (Jsat) for the devices prepared with TSA treated active layers is higher than that for the corresponding as cast counterparts. It means that the TSA active layer based device has a higher maximum exciton generation rate (Gmax). Gmax is given by Jsat = qGmaxL, where L is the thickness of the active layer. The higher Gmax reflects the higher photon absorption which is consistent with the absorption profile of TSA treated active layers (Fig. 4). We have also estimated the charge collection probability (Pc) in the devices processed with the as cast and TSA treated active layers, Pc = Jsc/Jphsat,20 and the values are 0.54, 0.56 0.82, and 0.84 for as cast DINI-DCV:PC71BM, DINI-IND:PC71BM, TSA treated DINI-DCV:PC71BM and DINI-IND:PC71BM based devices, respectively. Therefore, the enhanced Jsc in the TSA treated active layer based OSCs is attributable to the enhanced light absorption and light harvesting in the active layer and efficient charge collection.

Conclusions
We have designed and synthesized four A–D–A small molecules with a common central dihydroindoloindole (DINI) donor unit and different acceptor end groups such as dicyanovinylene (DCV), indenedione (IND), cyanoacrylate (CA) and rhodanine (Rho) linked through bi-thiophene as the π-linker denoted as DINI-DCV, DINI-IND, DINI-CA and DINI-Rho and their optical and electrochemical properties were investigated. These small molecules were used as electron donors along with PC71BM as an acceptor for solution processed small molecule OSCs. After the optimization of the donor to acceptor weight ratio, spinning speed and concentration, the 1:2 weight ratio showed the best photovoltaic performance for all small molecules. The OSCs based on DINI-CA:PC71BM, DINI-DCV:PC71BM, DINI-Rho:PC71BM and DINI-IND:PC71BM spin cast from DCB showed PCEs of 1.63%, 2.53%, 2.13% and 3.04%, respectively, indicating that the acceptor end group has an impact on the overall PCE. In order to improve the PCE further, we have employed a simple TSA (combined thermal annealing and subsequent solvent vapor annealing) treatment of the active layer and the PCE has been improved significantly (7.04% and 6.16% for DINI-IND:PC71BM and DINI-DCV:PC71BM, respectively) which is ascribed to the better nanophase morphology, crystallinity, molecular packing and light harvesting ability of active layers, induced by the TSA treatment. These combined properties enhance the exciton generation efficiency and lead to relatively better balanced charge transport, resulting in the improvement in Jsc, FF and PCE of the resulting OSCs.
