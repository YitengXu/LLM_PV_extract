    , Accepted 25th May 2018First published on 26th May 2018AbstractIn recent years, metal clusters-based photoelectrocatalysis has elicited considerable attention; nonetheless, the exploitations of high efficiency metal clusters–semiconductor heterostructured photoelectrodes are still in the infant stage. Herein, by judiciously capitalizing on glutathione-capped gold (Aux) nanoclusters and graphene quantum dots (GQDs) as building blocks and spatially hierarchically ordered nanoporous TiO2 nanotube arrays (NP-TNTAs) as a conceptual semiconductor platform, GQDs and Aux clusters were rationally and closely integrated on the framework of NP-TNTAs through a progressive electrostatic self-assembly strategy. It was unraveled that Aux clusters play a decisive role in triggering the cascade interfacial charge transfer from GQDs to NP-TNTAs owing to their cooperative synergy, thereby affording conspicuously enhanced solar-powered photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting performances under simulated solar light irradiation. Furthermore, the specific PEC water splitting mechanism was unambiguously determined, which for the first time bridges the gap between metal clusters and carbon materials in terms of intrinsic correlations in the charge transfer pathway. It is anticipated that our work would spur further interest in exploring metal cluster-based PEC systems for solar energy conversion.
1. Introduction
Semiconductor-based photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting for solar energy conversion has garnered enormous attention since the pioneering work launched by Honda and Fujishima in 1972.1,2 Following this astounding discovery, diverse TiO2 nanostructures have thus been explored, which triggered a renaissance of great interest for solar-powered water splitting.3,4 Nevertheless, to date, fast recombination of photogenerated charge carriers and the confined light absorption threshold of TiO2 in the UV region of the solar spectrum retard the development of high-efficiency TiO2-based PEC cells.5 To solve these dilemmas, various strategic modifications have thus been developed such as vacancy modulation,3 element doping,6,7 noble metal deposition,8,9 or integration with second ingredients (e.g., narrow-band-gap semiconductors,10,11 carbon materials12 or quantum dots).13 Despite the endeavors, the rational design and construction of TiO2-based heterostructured photoelectrodes has still been a central challenge.
Graphene quantum dots (GQDs) have been attracting increasing interest for the sake of their fascinating merits including analogous structural frameworks and constituent units to graphene (GR), more active sites on the planar surface and the quantum confinement effect in comparison with GR.14–16 Although GQDs have been tentatively explored in the past few years for photocatalytic applications (e.g., pollutant removal and hydrogen production),17–20 fine-tuning of photoelectrons emitted from GQDs along with their specific charge transfer pathways has seldom been reported. On the other hand, more recently, metal nanoclusters with a mean diameter of ≤2 nm and possessing a specific number of metal atoms and ligands have been established as a pivotal sector of nanomaterials in terms of unique atom stacking mode,21–25 peculiar light absorption capability and quantum confinement effect, which are distinct compared with conventional metal nanocrystals and their bulk counterparts. However, it is worth noting that explorations on the specific charge transport characteristics of metal clusters together with their cooperative synergy with semiconductors are in the infant stage.26–28 Inspired by the structural merits of GQDs and metal clusters, we wonder at the intrinsic correlation between zero-dimensional (0D) carbon materials (GQDs) and metal clusters that is responsible for the charge transport in semiconductor-based PEC cells, which is hitherto unknown.
With these considerations, herein, hierarchically ordered glutathione-capped gold cluster (Aux)-anchored and GQD-enwrapped nanoporous TiO2 nanotube array (NP-TNTA) ternary heterostructures have been elaborately designed by a progressive electrostatic self-assembly strategy for solar-powered PEC water splitting. The cooperativity of GQDs and Aux clusters in affecting the cascade charge transport in PEC cells was disclosed and the detailed mechanism was determined, which for the first time bridges the gap between these two newly developed nanomaterials.
2. Results and discussion
As illustrated in Scheme 1, a spatially hierarchically ordered NP-TNTA scaffold was firstly prepared by a two-step anodization approach,29–31 which gives rise to the hierarchical top-ring and bottom-tube nanoarchitecture. Subsequently, positively charged NP-TNTAs attained by a facile acid treatment were directly immersed into intrinsically negatively charged colloidal GOQD aqueous solution to access the spontaneous electrostatic self-assembly. Reduction of GOQDs to GQDs was achieved by calcination in an inert atmosphere and a GQDs/NP-TNTA binary heterostructure was thus attained. The GQDs/NP-TNTA heterostructure was further treated with aminopropyltrimethoxysilane (APTMS) to afford a positively charged surface which is conducive to cascade self-assembly of negatively charged Aux clusters on the outer layer of GOQDs, thus resulting in a well-defined Aux/GQDs/NP-TNTA ternary heterostructure. For comparison, Aux/NP-TNTA and GQDs/NP-TNTA binary counterparts were also fabricated by the analogous electrostatic self-assembly strategy between negatively charged Aux clusters or GOQDs and the positively charged NP-TNTA matrix (Fig. S1†).
 Scheme 1  Schematic illustration for progressive construction of Aux/GQDs/NP-TNTA ternary heterostructures via an electrostatic self-assembly strategy. 
Our work begins with the characterization of building blocks for self-assembly. The size, surface charge, and morphologies of Aux clusters, GOQDs, and NP-TNTAs, which were utilized as building blocks, are specifically characterized in Fig. S2–S4,† respectively. Fig. S4† shows that pristine NP-TNTAs is features a hierarchically ordered nano-architecture composed of a thin and uniform nano-porous layer on the top and highly ordered nanotubes at the bottom with a mean diameter of 100 nm. It is noteworthy that it has been well-established that the nano-porous layer of NP-TNTAs can play a crucial role as the photon crystal for substantial light harvesting.28 As shown in Fig. S5a,† the panoramic FESEM image of the GQDs/NP-TNTA binary heterostructure is analogous to pristine NP-TNTAs (Fig. S4d†) and no GQDs can be observed on the surface owing to the small size of GQDs (5.5 nm, Fig. S3b†). However, deposition of GQDs on the NP-TNTA substrate was corroborated by the elemental mapping (Fig. S5b–d†) results and TEM & HRTEM (Fig. 1a and d) images, implying that the intrinsic surface charge properties of GQDs and NP-TNTAs can be harnessed to trigger the spontaneous electrostatic self-assembly. Similar results were observed for the Aux/NP-TNTA binary heterostructure in terms of the ultra-small size of Aux clusters (1.5 nm, Fig. S2†), as displayed in Fig. S6a.† The TEM image (Fig. 1b and e) and the corresponding elemental mapping results (Fig. S6b–d†) verify the intimate integration of Aux clusters with the NP-TNTA matrix via electrostatic interaction. Note that no lattice fringe of the Aux clusters was seen in the HRTEM image (Fig. 1e) of Aux/NP-TNTAs, which results from the peculiar stacking fashion of Au atoms in the clusters and this is distinct from conventional Au nanocrystals which generally adopt face-centered cubic (fcc) stacking mode. Successful fabrication of NP-TNTAs, GQDs/NP-TNTAs and Aux/NP-TNTAs can also be evidenced by the high-resolution X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra of C 1s and Au 4f, as reflected in Fig. S8–S10,† respectively. The capabilities of GQDs and Aux clusters to spontaneously self-assemble on the NP-TNTAs strongly imply that GQDs and Aux clusters can serve as favorable building blocks by finely tuning their intrinsic surface charge properties, which lays a solid foundation for progressive self-assembly of ternary heterostructures. As apparently shown in Fig. 1c and f in conjunction with the corresponding elemental mapping and EDS results (Fig. 1h–l), a large amount of GQDs and Aux clusters were uniformly tethered on the TiO2 nanotubes with close interfacial contact. The differentiation of GQDs and Aux clusters in the ternary heterostructure can be reflected by the elemental mapping results (Fig. 1h and i) and corresponding lattice fringe in the HRTEM image in which a single GQD was closely enwrapped by several Aux clusters (Fig. 1f). Hence, the results strongly confirm that the assembly units of GQDs and Aux clusters have been progressively assembled on the NP-TNTAs under electrostatic interaction. The thickness of Aux/GQDs/NP-TNTAs is determined to be ca. 4 μm by the cross-sectional FESEM image (Fig. S7†) and it is similar to that of pristine NP-TNTAs.

(g) Panoramic FESEM image, and (h–l) energy dispersive spectra (EDS) of the Aux/GQDs/NP-TNTA ternary heterostructure (scale bar: 50 nm). Corresponding schematic models are displayed in the insets of (a–c). 
As displayed in the Raman results (Fig. 2a), the peaks at 146 (Eg), 399 (B1g), 517 (A1g + B1g), and 639 cm−1 (Eg) for all the samples are accurately attributed to anatase TiO2 (ref. 26) and this is in good agreement with the XRD results (Fig. S12†). Self-assembly of GQDs in the GQDs/NP-TNTA and Aux/GQDs/NP-TNTA heterostructures can also be verified by the pronounced Raman signals at 1360 and 1590 cm−1 which are attributed to the D and G bands of GQDs (Fig. S13†),13,14 respectively. As well, deposition of Aux clusters on the Aux/NP-TNTA and Aux/GQDs/NP-TNTA heterostructures can be additionally confirmed by the FTIR results (Fig. 2b), for which two peaks at 2918.4 & 2850.5 cm−1 and one peak at 1628 cm−1 corresponding to the stretching vibration modes of –CH2 & sp3 carbon in the carboxyl groups of GQDs and –COO− groups originating from the surface GSH ligand of Aux clusters were evidently seen in the FTIR spectra of Aux/NP-TNTA and Aux/GQDs/NP-TNTA heterostructures.28 As displayed in Fig. 2c, the DRS results show that the light absorption threshold of NP-TNTAs was red-shifted to the visible region with sole decoration of GQDs (ca. 450 nm) and Aux clusters (ca. 500 nm). Notably, it was further red-shifted to a longer wavelength (ca. 525 nm) with concurrent deposition of GQDs and Aux clusters, implying that both GQDs and Aux clusters play pivotal roles in boosting the light absorption capabilities of ternary heterostructures. Apparently, GQDs and Aux clusters are beneficial for remarkably improving the light response of NP-TNTAs to the visible region. The high-resolution Au spectrum (Fig. 2d) of the Aux/GQDs/NP-TNTA ternary heterostructure shows two doublet 4f peaks, which suggests the co-existence of two chemical states of Au species in Aux clusters, that is Au+ (88.5 and 84.9 eV for Au 4f5/2 and Au 4f7/2)32 and Au0 (87.4 and 83.8 eV for Au 4f5/2 and Au 4f7/2)33,34 agreeing well with the core–shell nano-architecture [i.e., Au(0)@Au(I)–GSH] of Aux clusters.25,35 The High-resolution Ti 4f spectrum of the Aux/GQDs/NP-TNTA ternary heterostructure in Fig. 2e corresponds to the Ti element in the oxidation state of +4,36 implying the phase of the NP-TNTA substrate was retained during the self-assembly. The integration of GQDs in the Aux/GQDs/NP-TNTA ternary heterostructure was verified by the high-resolution spectrum of C 1s (Fig. S11†).

The PEC water splitting performances of photoelectrodes were examined under simulated solar light irradiation. Systematic investigations were firstly carried out to uncover the influence of GQDs and Aux cluster loading amount on the PEC water splitting performances of GQDs/NP-TNTA and Aux/NP-TNTA binary heterostructure by modulating the concentration of GOQDs, the dipping time of the NP-TNTA substrate in the GOQD aqueous solution, and the dipping time of optimal GQDs/NP-TNTAs in Aux cluster aqueous solution. Fig. S14 and S15† suggest that PEC water splitting performances of the GQDs/NP-TNTA binary heterostructure have close correlation with the GOQD concentration and dipping time of the NP-TNTA substrate in the GOQD aqueous solution. The optimal concentration of the GOQD precursor and dipping time were determined to be 0.5 mg mL−1 and 48 h. Similarly, the optimal dipping time of GQDs/NP-TNTAs in Aux cluster aqueous solution for tuning the Aux cluster loading amount was determined to be 96 h (Fig. S16†). Based on which, optimal experimental conditions for constructing highly efficient Aux/GQDs/NP-TNTA ternary heterostructures were thus determined and this is beneficial for following rational comparison among different samples.
As reflected by the LSV results (Fig. 3a), the photocurrents of all the samples increase with increasing the applied bias, indicative of a typical n-type semiconductor.37 It is apparent that the photocurrent of pristine NP-TNTAs was conspicuously enhanced with the sole decoration of GQDs and Aux clusters and the latter exerts a more substantial influence. When GQDs and Aux clusters were simultaneously self-assembled on the NP-TNTAs, the photocurrent of NP-TNTAs was further remarkably enhanced in comparison with other single-component functionalized NP-TNTA counterparts. The photocurrent of the different samples follows the order of Aux/GQDs/NP-TNTAs > Aux/NP-TNTAs > GQDs/NP-TNTAs > NP-TNTAs, among which Aux/GQDs/NP-TNTAs demonstrate the most enhanced PEC water splitting performances with favorable photostability (Fig. 3c) under simulated solar light irradiation. Interestingly, decoration of GQDs and Au did not influence the onset but improved the current density of binary and ternary heterostructures, which indicates the possibility of constructing an artificial photosynthesis system with low energy consumption for substantial solar energy conversion. The analogous result was also reflected by the on–off transient photocurrent of the same samples (Fig. 3b), strongly corroborating the cooperative synergy of GQDs and Aux clusters in improving the PEC water splitting performances of NP-TNTAs. Interfacial charge transfer efficiency was evaluated from the EIS results.38Fig. 3d shows that the Aux/GQDs/NP-TNTA ternary heterostructure exhibits the smallest semi-circle arc radius compared with other counterparts implying the most efficient charge transfer efficiency in the interfacial region of a photoelectrode–electrolyte. Consistently, the Mott–Schottky results (Fig. 3e) reveal that the Aux/GQDs/NP-TNTA ternary heterostructure possesses the largest charge carrier density followed by Aux/NP-TNTAs, GQDs/NP-TNTAs and NP-TNTAs. The IPCE was further utilized to determine the specific light response region that contributes to the significantly enhanced PEC water splitting performances of composited photoanodes. As disclosed in Fig. 3f, compared with the IPCE spectrum of blank NP-TNTAs within the wavelength profile from 400 to 500 nm, the IPCE values of Aux/NP-TNTAs and GQDs/NP-TNTAs were markedly boosted and Aux/NP-TNTAs demonstrate more enhanced conversion efficiency relative to GQDs/NP-TNTAs. Notably, the Aux/GQDs/NP-TNTA ternary heterostructure still exhibited the most enhanced IPCE value in comparison with its corresponding binary counterparts within the wavelength profile from 400 to 600 nm, once again implying the synergistic interaction of GQDs and Aux clusters and thereby affording optimal PEC water splitting performances under simulated solar light irradiation. The electron lifetime was evaluated by the decay of photovoltage in the dark upon turning off the light irradiation.5 As mirrored in Fig. S17,† Aux/GQDs/NP-TNTAs exhibited the longest electron lifetime followed successively by Aux/NP-TNTAs, GQDs/NP-TNTAs and blank NP-TNTAs, which is in accordance with the LSV, transient photocurrent, EIS and IPCE results. Alternatively, the faradaic efficiency of Aux/GQDs/NP-TNTAs toward oxygen production was determined to be nearly 100% (Fig. S18†), corroborating highly efficient PEC water splitting in our reaction system.

(c) Photocurrent of Aux/GQDs/NP-TNTA ternary heterostructures (GOQDs: 0.5 mg mL−1, 48 h; Aux: 96 h) under continuous simulated solar light irradiation (AM1.5, 100 mW cm−2, 0.5 M Na2SO4, pH = 5.8). 
Photo-induced charge carrier separation was probed by a PL technique. Fig. S19† shows that the PL intensity of Aux clusters decreases with the addition of TiO2 scratched from NP-TNTAs, which suggests electrons photo-excited from the LUMO of Aux clusters can flow to the conduction band (CB) of TiO2.25,39 That is, the LUMO energy level of Aux clusters is higher than the CB of TiO2. As unveiled in Fig. S20,† the PL intensity of GQDs decreases with the addition of TiO2, reflecting the spontaneous electron transfer from the LUMO of GQDs to the CB of TiO2 as well as the higher LUMO energy level of GQDs than the CB of TiO2.18 Note that the PL intensity of GQDs in Aux/GQDs/NP-TNTAs is still lower than that in GQDs/NP-TNTAs, which indicates that Aux clusters play a crucial role in boosting the electron transport from GQDs to NP-TNTAs. According to our previous work,38 it has been ascertained that in situ transformation of Aux clusters to Au nanocrystals occurs under simulated or visible light irradiation. Therefore, we believe local enhancement of the electro-magnetic field arising from the plasmonic effect of Au NPs in situ transformed from Aux clusters promotes the electron flow from the LUMO of photoexcited GQDs to the CB of TiO2.
With a view to clarifying the PEC mechanism of the Aux/GQDs/NP-TNTA ternary heterostructure, the LUMO and HOMO band potentials of GQDs were accurately determined by cathodic and anodic scans (Fig. S21a–c†), by which the LUMO and HOMO levels of GQDs were determined to be −0.83 V and 1.50 V (vs. RHE),40 respectively. On the other hand, the LUMO energy level of GSH-capped Aux clusters has been determined to be −0.63 V (vs. RHE) and their bandgap is roughly estimated to be ca. 2.76 eV (Fig. S2b†).23 Hence, the HOMO energy level of Aux clusters is calculated to be ca. 2.13 V (vs. RHE) by the formula EHOMO − ELUMO = Eg.25,26 Based on the above analysis, the relative energy levels of GQDs, Aux clusters and NP-TNTAs in the ternary heterostructure can be illustrated (Fig. S21d†) and the corresponding PEC water splitting mechanism is depicted in Fig. S22.† More specifically, when the Aux/GQDs/NP-TNTA ternary heterostructure was irradiated with simulated solar light, the building blocks of GQDs, Aux clusters and NP-TNTAs were concurrently band-gap-photoexcited generating electron–hole charge carriers. Instantly, there exists main three electron transfer pathways in the current reaction system including (I) direct electron transport from the LUMO of Aux clusters to the CB of the TiO2 substrate,25 (II) direct electron transport from the LUMO of GQDs to the CB of TiO2, and more predominantly, (III) cascade electron transfer from the LUMO of GQDs to the LUMO of Aux clusters and then transport to the CB of TiO2 in terms of the favorable band alignment of assembly units in the ternary heterostructure (Fig. S21d†). Apparently, Aux clusters act as highly efficient electron transport mediators which conspicuously benefits relaying and smooth flow of photoelectrons resulting in a cascade charge transport pathway. Simultaneously, photo-induced holes in the VB of TiO2 flow to the HOMO levels of Aux clusters and GQDs and react with the electron donor, by which photoexcited electrons and holes over different building blocks are effectively separated for the following water reduction and oxidation reactions, respectively.
3. Conclusion
In summary, spatially hierarchically ordered Aux cluster enwrapped and GQD incorporated NP-TNTA ternary heterostructures have been elaborately and progressively designed via a strategic electrostatic self-assembly approach for solar-powered PEC water splitting. The cooperative synergy of GQDs and Aux clusters in combination with the decisive role of Aux clusters as a cascade electron transport modulator for GQDs substantially contributes to the significantly enhanced PEC water splitting performances of the Aux/GQDs/NP-TNTA ternary heterostructure. The intrinsic correlation of GQDs with Aux clusters in terms of charge transport in PEC cells was for the first time unraveled, thus bridging the gap between these two promising 0D carbon nanomaterials and metal clusters. It is anticipated that our conceptual study would open new frontiers for understanding the essential role of Aux clusters in PEC reactions and simultaneously, provide new avenues for construction of various carbon materials–metal cluster-based photoelectrodes for solar energy conversion.
4. Experimental section
4.1 Materials
Titanium sheets, graphite sheets, deionized water (DI H2O, Milipore, 18.2 MΩ cm), ethylene glycol (CH2OH)2, ammonium fluoride (NH4F), hydrogen fluoride (HF), nitric acid (HNO3), hydrochloric acid (HCl), L-glutathione (reduced, 98%), gold(III) chloride trihydrate (99.9%), sodium sulfate, and 3-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane (APTMS).
4.2 Synthesis of L-glutathione capped Aux clusters
The synthesis of Aux clusters followed previous research.26,38 In brief, gold(III) chloride trihydrate (40 mg) and L-glutathione (GSH, 46 mg) were thoroughly mixed in 50 mL of DI H2O under ambient conditions. The mixture was continuously stirred until the appearance of a colorless solution and then was heated at 70 °C for 24 h. Subsequently, acetonitrile was added to the cluster solution to purify the clusters followed by washing several times with mixed solution of DI H2O and acetonitrile (1:3 in volume). Finally, the clusters were redissolved in DI H2O and stored under ambient conditions.
4.3 Preparation of GQDs
Graphene oxide quantum dots (GQDs) were prepared with CX-72 carbon black via refluxing in a concentrated nitric acid (HNO3) solution.13,14 Typically, 0.4 g dried CX-72 carbon black was added to 6 mol L−1 nitric acid (100 mL) and refluxed for 24 h at 110 °C. After cooling to below 30 °C, the product was centrifuged (12000 rpm) for 10 min to achieve a sediment and a supernatant. The resultant supernatant was treated at 200 °C to evaporate the nitric acid and water. After cooling to room temperature, a reddish-brown solid was acquired. Finally, the GQD aqueous solution was obtained by dissolving GQDs in DI H2O under 10 min sonication.
4.4 Preparation of the hierarchically ordered NP-TNTA substrate
Ti foil was first sonicated in acetone, ethanol and DI H2O, respectively. Subsequently, the cleaned Ti foil was treated with HF–HNO3–H2O mixed solution (1:4:5 in volume) for 30 s, thoroughly washed with DI H2O and dried with N2. Anodization was performed under ambient conditions (50 V, 2 h) to prepare TNTAs, in which Ti foil and graphite sheets were used as the working electrode and counter electrode, respectively. The electrolyte consisted of 0.3 wt% NH4F, ethylene glycol (196 mL) and DI H2O (4 mL). The resultant TNTAs were thoroughly washed with DI H2O, dried with a gentle stream of N2, and vigorously sonicated in ethanol or DI H2O to remove the surface layer. Anodization was repeated again (50 V, 30 min) to prepared the NP-TNTAs. In a similar way, NP-TNTAs were subjected to the same washing and drying procedures and finally calcined in air (450 °C, 1 h, 2 °C min−1). Their TiO2 thin film counterpart was prepared by vigorously sonicating the anodized NP-TNTAs in ethanol (25 min) and calcined under the same experimental conditions.
4.5 Preparation of Aux/NP-TNTA and GQDs/NP-TNTA binary heterostructures
NP-TNTAs (30 mm × 10 mm) were immersed in an acid solution (HCl, 1 M) for 30 min, thoroughly cleaned with DI H2O and dried with a gentle stream of N2. Afterward, acid-treated NP-TNTAs were immersed into Aux aqueous solution under ambient condition, followed by the same washing and drying procedures, which produced the Aux/NP-TNTA binary heterostructure. For fabricating the GQDs/NP-TNTA heterostructure, NP-TNTAs were immersed into the GOQD aqueous solution (1.0 mg mL−1) under ambient conditions, followed by the same drying with a N2 stream. Subsequently, the thus-obtained GOQDs/NP-TNTA heterostructure was calcined at 400 °C in N2 for 1 h, giving rise to a GQDs/NP-TNTA binary heterostructure.
4.6 Fabrication of Aux/GOQDs/NP-TNTA ternary heterostructures
The calcined GQDs/NP-TNTA heterostructure was first subjected to plasma treatment and then rapidly dipped into 3-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane (APTMS) solution (1% volume in ethanol) for 2 h at 90 °C, thoroughly washed with ethanol three times and dried with a gentle N2 stream. Following, APTMS-modified GQDs/NP-TNTAs were immersed into the Aux aqueous solution for different time periods under ambient conditions, washed with DI H2O, and dried with a N2 stream. It is noteworthy that, when the dipping time is longer than 24 h, the samples were withdrawn regularly from the Aux cluster aqueous solution every 24 h, washed with DI H2O, and dried with N2, and then dipped into APTMS solution for 30 min. After the same washing and drying procedures, the samples were re-immersed into the Aux cluster aqueous solution again until the desired dipping time. Finally, the composites were dried under ambient conditions to obtain the Aux/GQDs/NP-TNTA ternary heterostructures.
4.7 Characterization
The crystal structure was explored by X-ray diffraction (Brucker D8, 40 kV, 40 mA) using a Cu Kα radiation source. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution (HR) TEM images were collected using a JEOL model JEM 2010 EX instrument (200 kV). UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) were obtained on a UV-vis-NIR spectrometer (Varian Cary 500 Scan) using BaSO4 as the background. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra were collected on a photoelectron spectrometer (ESCALAB 250, Thermo Fisher Scientific), the binding energy (BE) of the element was calibrated based on the BE of carbon (284.60 eV). Morphology was probed by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, JEOL JSM6701F). Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were recorded on a PerkinElmer FTIR spectrometer. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were collected using an LP920-KS instrument. Atomic force microscopy (AFM, MFP3D, Asylum Research) images were taken using a silicon cantilever, which operates in a tapping mode. Dynamic light scattering analysis (Zeta PALS, Brookhaven Instruments Co.) was used to determine the zeta potential. Raman spectra were collected on a Renishaw inVia Raman System 1000 using an excitation source of 633 nm under ambient conditions.
4.8 Photoelectrochemical (PEC) measurements
PEC measurements were carried out on an electrochemical workstation (Zennium, Zahner). The electrochemical setup is composed of a conventional three-electrode system, a quartz cell containing 20 mL Na2SO4 (0.5 M, pH = 5.8) aqueous solution and a potentiostat. A platinum plate (20 mm × 10 mm) was used as the counter electrode and a Ag/AgCl electrode as the reference electrode. The sample films (20 mm × 10 mm) were vertically dipped into the electrolyte and irradiated with a 300 W xenon arc lamp (Newport) equipped with an AM1.5 filter. Monochromatic incident photo-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra were collected using the three-electrode system without bias, for which monochromatic light was provided by a 300 W xenon arc lamp (Newport) combined with a monochromator (Newport).
For determining the LUMO level of Aux clusters, Aux clusters were deposited on carbon paper and the CV results were probed in degassed acetonitrile containing 0.1 M tetrabutyl ammonium perchlorate as the electrolyte.23 The reduction and oxidation peaks in the CV result of Aux clusters were utilized to roughly determine the LUMO and HOMO band positions.
With a view to determining the LUMO and HUMO levels of GQDs, GQD solution was prepared by reducing GOQD precursor solution with diluted hydrated hydrazine aqueous solution (1%) and the solution was heated till the water was completely evaporated.13 Subsequently, DI H2O was added accompanied by ultra-sonication. Pure GQD electrodes for PEC measurements were prepared by drop-casting GQDs/water suspensions (50 μL) onto a screen-printed carbon electrode which was dried under ambient conditions. The PEC performances of pure GQD electrode were analyzed in a 0.5 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution with a Pt foil counter electrode and an Ag/AgCl reference electrode.
