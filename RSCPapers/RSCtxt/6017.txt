    , Accepted 19th September 2019First published on 20th September 2019AbstractA series of self-doped Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) nanocrystal films with Sn ions partially replaced by Zn ions were prepared from their colloidal solutions by electrophoretic deposition. The self-doped CZTS photocathodes yielded higher photocurrents than the pristine one, which was ascribed to the upper shift in the conduction band and the formation of a shallow defect level.
Solar to hydrogen conversion via photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting provides a promising way toward sustainable energy utilization.1–7 Delicate design and optimization of photoelectrodes is a prominent factor to boost the PEC performance. Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) has been identified as one of the ideal photoelectric materials for water splitting and solar cells due to its narrow band gap, excellent optical properties, and earth-abundant constituent elements.8–12 However, its multi-element feature largely increases the possibility of producing various point defects. The PEC properties of CZTS are usually limited by severe charge recombination caused by adverse defect states.13–15 These unfavourable defect states have deeper ionization levels, which is hard to realize the energy level transition, producing electron-trapping states in the CZTS.16,17
Cation substitution is a general approach to modulate the defect characteristics of CZTS. Specifically, cations in CZTS are replaced by other isovalent elements, which can alter the formation energy of antisite defects. For example, Cu+ can be replaced by Ag+, and Zn2+ can be substituted by Ba2+ or Cd2+.18–20 To suppress the CuZn antisite defects that can pin the Fermi level in the middle of the band gap when forming a p–n junction with n-type CdS, a (CuAg)2ZnSnS4 graded layer was developed due to the disparity of the formation energy between the CuZn and AgZn defects.21,22 However, the existing flaw in cation substitution by introducing hetero-atoms is prone to generating defects as recombination centres for photo-excited carriers due to the lattice mismatch and impurity phase. Therefore, a self-doping method is developed to overcome this disadvantage by doping the own element of CZTS without introducing foreign atoms. The self-doping strategy has been successfully employed to modify many semiconductors, such as BiOI, TiO2, C3N4, CuBi2O4, and BiMoO6, to enhance their photocatalytic performances.23–28 Herein, a self-doping route with Sn ions substituted by Zn ions based on colloidal chemistry is proposed to regulate the chemical composition of the CZTS nanocrystals (NCs). The defects and the energy band structure of CZTS NCs were optimized, thereby leading to improved PEC performance for water splitting.
A series of self-doped CZTS NCs with different Zn doping ratios to replace Sn ions were synthesized by a hot-injection method, and deposited on a fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) glass substrate by an electrophoretic deposition process (a schematic of the preparation process is shown in Fig. S1 and the detailed parameters are described in the ESI†). Depending on the self-doping ratios, they are denoted as CZTS-x. When x = 10%, it means 10% of Sn ions are replaced by Zn ions. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) characterization of CZTS and self-doped CZTS films is presented in Fig. 1a. The diffraction peaks observed at 2θ values of 28.39°, 47.24°, and 56.05° could be indexed to the corresponding crystal planes of kesterite CZTS (JCPDS no. 26-0575). Also, no other impurity phase was detected other than SnO2 from the FTO substrate. Because the ionic radius difference between Zn2+ and Sn4+ (0.74 and 0.69 Å for Zn2+ and Sn4+, respectively) is only 7%,29–31 there was no apparent XRD peak shift among different samples.31 Raman spectra were recorded to further study the crystal structures of CZTS and self-doped CZTS NCs (Fig. 1b). Only one Raman peak could be observed, indicating that a single phase was obtained for the self-doped CZTS NCs.32–34 The self-doping approach by substituting Sn ions with Zn ions would not introduce the impurity phase. Compared to pure CZTS, the Raman peaks of the self-doped CZTS samples showed gradual shifts toward higher wavenumbers, which could be ascribed to the successful doping of Zn ions.

According to the XRD results, the CZTS NCs possessed the kesterite phase, which was derived from chalcopyrite CuInS2 by replacing In ions with Zn and Sn ions.35 As shown in Fig. 1c, the Cu–Zn layer and the Cu–Sn layer are alternately arranged to construct the (001) layers of the metal sublattice of CZTS. The Zn and Cu ions in the Cu–Zn layer are exchanged between two coherent Cu–Zn layers, and the same change appears for the Sn and Cu ions in the Cu–Sn layer between two consecutive Cu–Sn layers. After self-doping, the Zn and Cu ions in the Cu–Zn layer would remain the same as the pristine CZTS. Besides, some Sn atoms are replaced by Zn atoms in the Cu–Sn layer, which means a new Cu–Sn–Zn layer appearing in the (001) layers of the metal sublattice.
The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of CZTS-x NCs with increasing x values are shown in Fig. 2a–c. No significant change in the morphology of the NCs was found. The self-doped CZTS NCs possessed an irregular shape with an average size of about 15 nm. With the increasing doping ratio, the particle size gradually decreased (Fig. S2, ESI†), which might result from the small difference in the reaction rate of the Zn and Sn precursors with sulphur. The morphology of the CZTS-40% film is displayed in Fig. 2d. The irregular nanocrystals were tightly stacked on the FTO glass. The thickness of the CZTS-40% film was around 240 nm measured from the cross-sectional-view scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image (the inset of Fig. 2d). The UV-vis absorption spectra of CZTS and self-doped CZTS are shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†). All samples showed broad absorption ranges. The optical band gaps of CZTS and self-doped CZTS can be determined by extrapolating the linear portion of the (αhν)2vs. hν plots (Fig. S4, ESI†).36 Increasing the self-doping ratio could lead to a change in the band gaps from 1.50 to 1.55 eV, which suggested that the substitution of Sn ions with Zn ions would slightly alter the band structures.

The surface elements of CZTS and self-doped CZTS were analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (Fig. S5, ESI†). The Cu 2p peaks at binding energies of 931.6 (2p3/2) and 951.4 eV (2p1/2) were indexed to the Cu(I) state.36 The Zn 2p peaks showed the binding energies of 1021.6 (2p3/2) and 1044.7 eV (2p1/2), proving the presence of the Zn(II) state.37 The Sn 3d peaks located at 486.1 (3d5/2) and 494.6 eV (3d3/2) were consistent with the characteristic peaks of Sn(IV).38 The S 2p peaks located at 161.3 (2p3/2) and 162.5 eV (2p1/2) were in accordance with the values of the sulphide phases.39 Therefore, the detailed XPS results further indicated the formation of CZTS.36–39 In addition, the elemental compositions were examined by X-ray fluorescence (XRF) analysis. As shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†), the varying trends of the measured elemental concentrations of CZTS and self-doped CZTS are in good agreement with those of the theoretical concentrations. Generally, CZTS samples prepared by a hot injection method are Cu-rich, Sn-rich, and Zn-poor.40 Increasing the x value resulted in an increased concentration of Zn element and a decreased concentration of Sn element, while the amount of copper remained almost constant. Zn2+ ions have an ionic radius comparable to that of Sn4+ ions,29–31 which indicates that the substitution of Sn4+ ions by Zn2+ ions should be feasible. Theoretical calculations also prove that it is favorable to substitute Sn4+ ions by Zn2+ ions under the Zn-rich/Sn-poor conditions.13,41,42 According to the above analysis, it can be summarized that Sn4+ ions were successfully substituted by Zn2+ ions in the CZTS lattice.
The current–potential curves of CZTS and self-doped CZTS NC films in 0.1 M Na2SO4 solution (pH adjusted to 3) are shown in Fig. 3a. They all exhibited negative photocurrents, indicating the p-type characters of the as-prepared CZTS-x NCs. For water splitting, the fabricated photoelectrodes acted as photocathodes for hydrogen production. All self-doped CZTS films showed apparently improved PEC performances compared to the pristine CZTS film. When the value of x increased, the photocurrent density first increased and then decreased, reaching the maximum at x = 40% (Fig. 3a and b). The CZTS-40% photocathode yielded the best PEC performance with a photocurrent density of −0.25 mA cm−2 at −0.3 V vs. RHE (Fig. 3b). The photocathode was further modified with the deposition of the CdS layer to form a p–n heterojunction for faster charge separation and transport, as well as the loading of the Pt catalyst to accelerate the water reduction reaction.33 As shown in Fig. 3c, the Pt/CdS/CZTS-40% photocathode showed a photocurrent density of −1.2 mA cm−2 at −0.3 V vs. RHE. The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) test was examined. As displayed in Fig. 3d, the Pt/CdS/CZTS-40% photocathode yielded IPCE values of 3–7% at a wavelength ranging from 350 to 800 nm, indicating that the photocathode showed strong visible light absorption and could efficiently utilize the incident light for PEC water splitting.

The PEC measurements were carried out in 0.1 M Na2SO4 solution (pH = 3, adjusted with H2SO4) with light on/off under AM 1.5G illumination. 
As shown in Fig. 4a, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to investigate the influence of self-doping on the band structure of CZTS. It was found that the valence band minimum (VBM) and the conduction band maximum (CBM) of the self-doped CZTS both showed an upper shift compared with those of CZTS. The density of states (DOS) of the CB edge mainly consists of S-p and Sn-s hybridization states. The CBM shift of CZTS-x can be ascribed to the substitution of Sn4+ with Zn2+.42 The DOS of the VB edge mainly contains S-p and Cu-d hybridization states. The self-doping by replacing Sn4+ with Zn2+ can also result in an upward shift of the VBM.43 Besides, the DOS plot of CZTS shows a deep localized state in the bandgap, which could be attributed to the adverse defects.17 However, a shallow localized state appears near the CB edge for self-doped CZTS. Enlightened by the above analysis, an underlying mechanism of the self-doping strategy for improved PEC performance was proposed. As shown in Fig. 4b, the disadvantageous defects in CZTS can induce a deep trap state within the band gap of CZTS.17 The deep trap state can act as a charge recombination centre, which would thereby deteriorate the PEC activity. However, after self-doping in CZTS, a shallow defect level forms, which can increase the carrier density and improve the carrier mobility. In addition, an upper shift of the CBM can promote the PEC hydrogen evolution. Therefore, the self-doped CZTS photocathode showed improved PEC performance.

In summary, CZTS NC films were prepared via a hot-injection method followed by an electrophoretic deposition process. A self-doping strategy with Sn ions partially substituted by Zn ions was employed to modulate the chemical composition and electronic structure of CZTS nanocrystals. The self-doped CZTS showed apparently improved PEC properties compared to the pristine CZTS. The improvement of PEC performance should be attributed to the upper shift in the conduction band and the formation of a shallow defect level, which would facilitate charge transfer and hydrogen production. After the modification of CdS and Pt, the Pt/CdS/CZTS photocathode showed a good PEC performance for water splitting. The present work provides new insights by using a self-doping strategy to modulate the properties of photoelectric materials, and sheds light on the development of efficient copper-based chalcogenide photocathodes for PEC water splitting.
