    , Accepted 8th June 2017First published on 9th June 2017AbstractA tri-layered photoelectrode for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) is assembled using single crystal hollow TiO2 nanoparticles (HTNPs), sub-micro hollow TiO2 mesospheres (SHTMSs) and hierarchical TiO2 microspheres (HTMSs). The bottom layer composed of single crystal hollow TiO2 nanoparticles serves to absorb dye molecules, harvest light due to its hollow structure and keep a better mechanical contact with FTO conducting glass; the middle layer consisting of sub-micro hollow mesospheres works as a multifunctional layer due to its high dye adsorption ability, strong light trapping and scattering ability and slow recombination rates; and the top layer consisting of hierarchical microspheres enhances light scattering. The DSSCs made of photoanodes with a tripartite-layer structure (Film 4) show a superior photoconversion efficiency (PCE) of 9.24%, which is 7.4% higher than a single layered photoanode composed of HTNPs (Film 1: 8.90%), 4.6% higher than a double layer-based electrode consisting of HTNPs and SHTMSs (Film 2: 9.03%) and 2.6% higher than a double layer-based electrode made of HTNPs and HTMSs (Film 3: 9.11%). The significant improvements in the PCE for tri-layered TiO2 photoanodes are mainly because of the combined effects of their higher light scattering ability, long electron lifetime, fast electron transport rate, efficient charge collection and a considerable surface area with high dye-loading capability. This study confirms that the facile tri-layered photoanode is an interesting structure for high-efficiency DSSCs.
Introduction
Due to their low-cost, light weight, easy fabrication process and better efficiency, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have been studied extensively and attracted significant attention over the last two decades as a renewable and clean energy source.1–3 To improve photovoltaic performance, each part of DSSCs, including photoanodes,4–6 counter electrodes,7–9 electrolytes,10–12 and sensitizers13–15 has been widely researched. Consequently, an overall photoconversion efficiency of over 14% has been achieved so far.16
Traditional anatase TiO2 nanocrystallite (20 nm in diameter) based porous anodes have a large internal surface area to load a huge amount of dye molecules but possess poor light harvesting ability due to negligible light scattering and high transparency.6,17,18 In addition, the presence of grain boundaries and surface defects within TiO2 nanocrystals could significantly slow down the electron transport, resulting in electron recombination, and thus hinder the further enhancement of DSSC performance.19–21 Conventionally, large particles with smooth surfaces exhibit excellent light scattering abilities. However, the low surface area and consequently less dye loading make them unsuitable for use as photoanode materials.22,23 In general, a large specific surface area, a high light scattering effect, fast electron transport and low recombination rates are desirable properties for a well-performing photoanode, but it is hard to have all these features in a single material with a particular structure.24–30 To tackle these problems and to accommodate all of the positive characteristics and specific advantages, some types of double-layered or multi-layered photoelectrodes, based on different TiO2 nanostructures have been demonstrated.31–34 For effective and efficient light-scattering layers, various hierarchical TiO2 nanostructures with multi-functional properties, such as nanospindles,17 mesoporous microspheres,18 hierarchical microspheres,19,35 hollow spheres,4,36etc., have been used. Compared to their counterparts with low dimensions, these hierarchical structures offer both large dye uptake and strong light harvesting efficiency. Moreover, hollow structures have also drawn much attention because of their low density, high specific surface areas and relatively good performance in photovoltaic devices.37–39 However, due to complex multistep procedures, which would bring in additional cost and insufficient thickness of the bottom layer, further enhancement in efficiency was still restricted. A recent example of a trilayer TiO2 photoelectrode based on P25 nanoparticles as a bottom layer, TiO2 nanotube arrays as a middle layer and hollow TiO2 boxes as a top layer, yielded a PCE of 6.03%.40
In this work, we report for the first time a simple approach to synthesize a facile tri-layered photoanode on an FTO substrate, consisting of a bottom layer of hollow TiO2 nanoparticles (HTNPs), a middle layer of sub-micro hollow TiO2 mesospheres (SHTMSs) and a top layer of hierarchical TiO2 microspheres (HTMSs). Specifically, the bottom layer composed of hollow TiO2 nanoparticles serves to absorb dye molecules, harvest light due to its hollow structure and keep a better mechanical contact with FTO conducting glass. The middle layer made of sub-micro hollow mesospheres works as a multifunctional layer due to its high dye adsorption ability, strong light trapping and scattering ability and slow recombination rates, while the hierarchical microspheres as the top layer enhance the light scattering ability. As a result, DSSCs based on a HTNP + SHTMS + HTMS triple layered photoanode show an exceptional efficiency of up to 9.24%.
Experimental details
Reagents and materials
Conducting glass plates (2.2 mm thick; 2.5 × 1.5 cm; F-doped SnO2; ∼7 ohms per square) were purchased from Pilkington. Ethanol (99.7%), titanium n-tetrabutoxide (TBT, 99%), tert-butyl alcohol (99.5%), titanium tetrachloride (99.0%), 4-tertbutylpyridine (4-TBP, 96%), iodine (I2, 99.99%), lithium iodide (LiI, 99.99%), ethyl cellulose and 1-methyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide (PMII, 98%) were bought from Aladdin. Acetonitrile (99.8%) and valeronitrile (99%) were from Alfa Aesar. Guanidinium thiocyanate (GuSCN, 99.0%) was from Aldrich and N719 dye (Ru[LL′-(NCS)2], L = 2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylic acid, L′ = 2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-ditetrabutylammonium carboxylate) was purchased from Solaronix. Terpineol, hydrofluoric acid (HF, 40% v/v) and acetic acid (HAc, 99%) were obtained from Guangzhou chemical reagent factory. All of these chemicals were directly used without further purification.
Synthesis of HTNPs, SHTMSs and HTMSs
In a typical synthesis, single crystal anatase hollow TiO2 nanoparticles (HTNPs, ∼25 nm), sub-micro hollow TiO2 mesospheres (SHTMSs, ∼400 nm) and hierarchical microspheres (SHTMSs, ∼2 μm) were synthesized by a modified solvothermal method41,42 with a precursor solution containing 35 mL of acetic acid, 1.5 mL of TBT, and different amounts of HF (100 μL for HTNPs, 50 μL for SHTMSs and 0 μL for HTMSs) in a 50 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and kept at 160 °C for 6 h each. After the hydrothermal reaction, autoclaves were cooled down to normal temperature. The precipitates were obtained as a white powder by centrifugation, washed 3 times each with deionized water and ethanol, alternatively, and dried overnight at 80 °C prior to calcination at 500 °C for 3 hours.
Fabrication of TiO2 tri-layered photoanodes
To prepare TiO2 based tri-layered photoanodes, three different kinds of pastes based on HTNPs, SHTMSs and HTMSs were synthesized following the method in ref. 38 and 39. Briefly, 10 mL of ethanol, 3.0 g of terpineol, 0.2 mL of HAc and 0.4 g of ethyl cellulose were homogeneously mixed with 1.0 g each of HTNPs, SHTMSs and HTMSs by grinding for 40 minutes, followed by ultrasonic dispersion for 15 minutes. Before the screen printing, the F-doped SnO2 conductive glasses (FTO glass) were cut into 2 × 1.5 cm pieces, washed ultrasonically for 15 minutes each with a detergent, acetone and double distilled water, and lastly dried under an argon gas flow. The number of screen-printings was repeated to control the thickness of the various films. After each printing, the films were dried for 5 minutes at 125 °C and sintered at different temperatures from 325 °C to 500 °C in air.19 Then, the thick TiO2 film with a tri-layer was treated with 40 mM aqueous solution of TiCl4 at 70 °C for 30 minutes, rinsed with ethanol and deionized water and reheated for 30 minutes at 500 °C. Furthermore, the films were loaded with dyes by immersing them in a 0.5 mM solution of N719 dye in tert-butanol and acetonitrile (1:1 v/v) for 16 h at room temperature. The dye-soaked tri-layered based photoanode was combined with a Pt-based counter electrode, prepared by coating 5 mM H2PtCl6 solution in terpineol on a well cleaned FTO glass, followed by heating at 420 °C for 30 minutes. An iodide-based liquid electrolyte containing 0.5 M 4-TBP, 0.03 M I2, 0.6 M PMII, 0.1 M GuSCN and 0.05 M LiI was injected into the space between the electrodes. The 0.16 cm2 active area of the resultant photoanode was exposed for the solar cell performance test.
Characterization and measurement
Phase purity and crystal structures of the samples were characterized by using a D8 ADVANCE X-ray diffraction (XRD) system, operated with a (λ = 0.15408 nm) Cu Kα radiation source in the range of 2θ from 10° to 80°. The morphologies of the resulting samples, synthesized by the hydrothermal process and the fabricated photoanode films were characterized using a scanning electron microscope (SEM, FEI Quanta, 20 kV) and a transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEOL JEM-2010, 200 kV). The thickness of the coated TiO2 films was measured by using a D-100 profilometer (KLA-Tencor). A UV-visible spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, UV-2500) was used to measure the amount of dye absorbed by TiO2 photoanodes and diffuse reflectance spectra. An Enlitech's QE-R system based on an integrating sphere was used for the measurement of transmittance spectra. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the assembled DSSCs were measured by using a Keithley model 2400, equipped with a solar simulator of intensity 100 mW cm−2 (Oriel, Model: 94041A). The sunlight illumination intensity was calibrated to a value of AM 1.5G by using a standard NREL-calibrated Si solar cell. The incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE) spectra were measured by using an Enlitech's QE-R system as a function of wavelength ranging from 400 to 800 nm. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were made by using an Electrochemical workstation (Princeton Applied Research, VerasSTAT 3-400) with a frequency ranging from 0.1 Hz to 100 kHz, followed by analysis using Z-view software. Intensity-modulated photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS) and intensity-modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) measurements were carried out in a frequency range from 100 kHz to 0.1 Hz by using an Electrochemical workstation (Zennium, Zahner) equipped with a source supply (Zahner, PP211).
Results and discussion
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the FTO glass substrate, the double and triple-layered films made of HTNPs, SHTMSs and HTMSs, are shown in Fig. S1.† The sharp and well-defined, high-intensity Bragg peaks indicate the excellent crystallinity of the samples. The diffraction peaks (101), (004), (200), (105), (211), (204), (116) and (220) situated at 2θ = (25.2°, 37.8°, 47.8°, 53.8°, 55.0°, 62.5°, 68.7° and 70.3°), respectively, are perfectly indexed to anatase TiO2 (JCPDS card no. 21-1272). The obtained double and triple layered TiO2 films were still without detectable impurities and well-crystallized as the anatase phase, even after the annealing and fabrication processes. After all, the hollow TiO2 nanoparticles, hollow microspheres, and triple layered TiO2 films show the same diffraction peaks although having a small difference in intensity.
The cross-section and morphology of the HTNP, SHTMS, HTMS samples and multi-layered films were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Fig. 1a, d and g display the SEM images of the as-prepared single crystal hollow TiO2 nanoparticles (HTNPs), sub-micro hollow TiO2 mesospheres (SHTMSs) and hierarchical TiO2 microspheres (HTMSs), respectively. It can be seen that all of the three samples are monodisperse without any agglomeration.

Fig. 2 shows the cross-sectional higher magnification SEM images of the single and multi-layered films (20 μm). Quite interestingly, strong mechanical connections, without any obvious signs of delamination were observed between the HTNP based bottom layer, the SHTMS based middle layer and the HTMS based top layer (Fig. 2d). All these three layers are in good attachment. Cross-sectional FE-SEM images of tri-layered DSSCs with different layer thicknesses and exchanging the materials used in the different layers can be seen in Fig. S2 and S3,† respectively. Additionally, more information about the structural and morphological characteristics of the as prepared samples was obtained by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Fig. 1b, e and h clearly show hollow nanoparticles, sub-micro hollow TiO2 mesospheres (made of hollow nanoparticles) and hierarchical TiO2 microspheres (consisting of nano-sheets), respectively. Furthermore, in the HRTEM images (Fig. 1c, f and i), the interplanar spacing of 0.352 nm indicates the (011) and (101) planes of anatase TiO2,44 which further clarifies the high purity of these samples as anatase TiO2 without any additional impurities.

Fig. 3a shows the typical J–V characteristic curves of the DSSCs composed of four kinds of films with the following configurations: Film 1 made of a single layer of hollow TiO2 nanoparticles (HTNPs, ∼20 μm), Film 2 formed of a double layer of HTNPs and SHTMS (∼10 μm + 10 μm), Film 3 based on a double layer of HTNPs and HTMSs (∼10 μm + 10 μm) and Film 4 consisting of a tri-layered photoanode of HTNPs, SHTMSs and HTMSs (∼10 μm + 6 μm + 4 μm). The detailed photovoltaic parameters of the fabricated DSSCs measured under AM 1.5G illumination (100 mW cm−2) are summarized in Table 1. The HTNP-based single layered DSSC had a Jsc of 16.67 mA cm−2 and a PCE of 8.90%. When single layered films were changed to double layered films by placing SHTMSs and HTMSs (∼10 μm), respectively, on top of the HTNP bottom layer (∼10 μm), the Jsc and PCE increased to 17.12 mA cm−2 and 9.03%, and 17.45 mA cm−2 and 9.11%, respectively, due to the enhanced light-scattering effect of the SHTMS and HTMS based top layers. Interestingly, the DSSC based on the triple layered TiO2 photoelectrode composed of HTNPs, SHTMSs and HTMSs outperformed the single and double layered ones, with a Jsc of 17.92 mA cm−2, a Voc of 799 mV, a fill factor of 0.65 and a higher PCE of up to 9.24%. Obviously, the significant improvement of the PCE for the tri-layered photoanode compared to the single and double-layered photoanodes is mainly attributed to the comparatively higher dye absorption due to the higher surface area and enhancement of the Jsc and the Voc. In details, the amount of the dye absorbed (may help to absorb more light) by Film 4 (139 nmol cm−2) is higher than those of Film 2 (120 nmol cm−2) and Film 3 (127 nmol cm−2), although slightly lower than that of Film 1 (144 nmol cm−2). The increased Jsc can be attributed to improved light harvesting by the sub-micro TiO2 hollow mesosphere and hierarchical TiO2 microsphere top layer and fast electron transport. Furthermore, an increase in Voc can be witnessed from 789 mV for the HTNP single layered film to 799 mV for the HTNP + SHTMS + HTMS tri-layered film. The main reason for this increase is the exhibition of longer electron lifetimes and effective suppression of electron recombination caused by the presence of hierarchical and hollow TiO2 micro- and mesospheres in the tri-layered films. Consequently, our productive design of such innovative tri-layered solar cells (Film 4) attained a pronounced PCE of 9.24% causing an enhancement of 7.4% over the single layered (Film 1), while 4.6% and 2.6% over the double layered (Film 2 and Film 3) based DSSCs, respectively.

Furthermore, to know the effect of the thickness of the middle and top layers on the photovoltaic performance of DSSCs, additional photoanodes with different middle and top layer thicknesses were prepared, as shown in Fig. S2b, d, f, h and J.† Interestingly enough, the efficiency changed greatly by doing so, showing strong dependence on varying thicknesses of these layers. It can be seen that the Jsc increased from 15.77 mA cm−2 to 17.92 mA cm−2 and then decreased back to 17.42 mA cm−2 as the thickness of the SHTMS middle layer rose from 3 μm to 7 μm while the thickness of the HTMS top layer decreased from 7 μm to 3 μm. This increase in the Jsc can be due to the increased dye loading caused by the increased surface area (because of the hollow structures and smaller sizes of SHTMSs compared to HTMSs). To be precise, it is the higher amount of dye uptake that may excite an increased number of photo-generated electrons and thus leads to a superior Jsc.45 Conversely, the Voc gradually decreased as the HTMS top layer thickness decreased, which can be ascribed to the increasing charge recombination due to additional trapping sites provided by the increasing thickness of SHTMSs middle layer. This is because the SHTMs are smaller than the HTMSs. In addition, SHTMs consist of small particles while HTMSs are composed of hierarchical TiO2 flowers (consisting of thin nanosheets) that can effectively suppress electron recombination by efficient electron transport and exhibit longer electron lifetimes.41,45 Moreover, we also checked the effect of exchanging the materials in different layers on Jsc and Voc, as shown in Fig. S3b, d, f, and h.† However, the final result suggests that the best combination is to place 10 μm HTNPs as a bottom layer, 6 μm SHTMSs as a middle layer and 4 μm HTMSs as a top layer.

Fig. 3b shows the incident photocurrent conversion efficiencies (IPCEs) of these DSSCs. The tri-layer photoelectrode based DSSCs show significantly higher IPCEs as compared to single and double-layer photoelectrode based DSSCs over the entire wavelength region. These results suggest that the combination of HTNPs + SHTMSs + HTMSs can offer more efficient light-harvesting capability than the HTNPs, HTNPs + SHTMSs and HTNPs + HTMSs, alone. SHTMSs and HTMSs with greater light reflection and scattering abilities are capable of reflecting light back to bottom layers, which will successfully escalate the optical length of the photoanode and thus result in relatively higher magnitude IPCE spectra (especially for long-wavelength incident light). This may also be attributed to the efficient dye adsorption, although in this case of a HTNP-based single layered film, dye absorption is relatively higher than for the tri-layered film. To find the exact amount of dye absorption, absorbed dye molecules were dissolved from the photoelectrodes in a 0.1 M NaOH solution46 and examined by UV-vis spectroscopy (Table 1, Fig. 4a).
 Fig. 4  (a) Dye absorption and (b) diffuse reflectance from photoanodes based on Film 1, Film 2, Film 3 and Film 4. 
The reflectivity of the given films was investigated to further explore their light scattering properties in detail. As shown in Fig. 4b, the UV-vis reflectance spectra of the tri-layered film consisting of HTNPs, SHTMSs and HTMSs are much higher than those of the single and double layered films, indicating better light scattering abilities for such a kind of tri-layered photoanode in both near-infrared and visible regions. The higher scattering can demonstrate that the bottom layer made of hollow nanoparticles with high transparency allows the transmission of the incident light into the sub-micro hollow mesospheres in the middle layer and hierarchical microspheres in the top layer, which result in the generation of photocurrent and collection of photoelectrons within outer layers. In addition, the bigger size of the hollow mesospheres and hierarchical microspheres facilitate the reflection of the transmitted light back toward the bottom layer consisting of nanoparticles, subsequently prolonging the optical transfer length of the electrode and thus enhancing the light harvesting efficiency. In summation, the excellent light scattering ability of the tri-layered film is the main reason for its higher photocurrent density (Jsc).

Fig. 5 shows electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements, which were carried out at −0.80 V bias in the dark to elucidate charge-transfer-related internal resistance of the single, double and tri-layered film based photoanodes. Table S1† illustrates the summarized results. Two well-defined semicircles in the EIS Nyquist spectra can be observed in the high (smaller semicircle) and medium (larger semicircle) frequency ranges. According to the literature reported for the EIS model of TiO2, a smaller semicircle represents the charge transfer between the counter electrode and electrolyte, while the larger semicircle denotes the TiO2–dye–electrolyte interface.47,48

As a result of using the same electrolyte and Pt/FTO counter electrode, the value of R1 for all cells is almost similar. However, R2, which is associated with recombination resistance, changes significantly from Film 4 to Film 1 based photoanodes (196.3 Ω, 146.8 Ω, 118.2 Ω and 66.50 Ω, respectively). This indicates a slower recombination rate for the tri-layered DSSCs. On the whole, typically the R2 values change with a change in the interfacial recombination resistance between the photoelectrode and electrolyte. Meanwhile, here all cells have similar hollow nanoparticles directly in contact with FTO glass. Therefore, the results can be attributed to the unique structures of the sub-micro hollow TiO2 mesospheres consisting of hollow nanoparticles and hierarchical TiO2 microspheres made of thin nanosheets that help electron transport and allow the electrolyte penetration, subsequently, lowering the recombination of I3− ions with conduction band electrons.
In order to understand the electron transport and recombination in these photoanodes, DSSCs were tested by intensity modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) and intensity modulated photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS). Fig. 6a and b show the plots of the electron transport times (τd) and electron life times (τr) for the four DSSCs measured by IMPS at short circuit and IMVS at open circuit, respectively.33,49 The τd and τr are calculated by using the formulae: τd = 1/2πfd and τr = 1/2πfr, where fd and fr are the imaginary components of the minimum frequencies of the IMPS spectra and IMVS spectra, respectively. The τd and τr give information about the electron transit time across the photoanodes and recombination time of electrons with I3− in the electrolyte, respectively.49,50 Clearly, the DSSC based on the tri-layered TiO2 photoanode shows a shorter τd and longer τr as compared to the double and single layered photoanode-based DSSCs, indicating a faster electron transport rate and a slower electron recombination rate for the former. Furthermore, the electron diffusion coefficient (Dn) was calculated by using the formula (Dn = d2/4τd, d is the film thickness)18,43 for all of the four cells and is plotted in Fig. 6c as a function of light intensity. It can be noticed that the Dn curve of the tri-layer-based DSSC lies above that of the double and single layer-derived DSSCs, once again endorsing the faster electron transition ability for the tri-layer-based photoanode. Thus, it is clear that such novel tri-layered photoanodes made of single crystal hollow TiO2 nanoparticles, sub-micro hollow TiO2 mesospheres and hierarchical TiO2 microspheres possess significant electron transport properties.

As electron transport highly depends on the morphology of the materials, the fast electron transport rate for the HTNPs + SHTMSs + HTMSs can be ascribed to the hierarchical TiO2 microspheres in the top-layer consisting of the tiny nanosheet and sub-micro hollow TiO2 mesospheres in the middle layer made of well-connected hollow nanoparticles. These nanostructures have been verified to have rarer surface trapping spots and defects for hindering electron recombination with I3− in the photoelectrode.19,51,52 The well-connected nano-sheets and nanoparticles in the case of HTMSs and SHTMSs, respectively, build a kind of highway for electron movement and consequently enhance the electron transport. The double and tri-layered films were fabricated by continuous screen-printing, using different morphological nanostructures of TiO2. Hence, an unbroken connection between all the three layers can be seen clearly. This seamless connection between the layers can additionally promote the Dn of the HTNP + SHTMS + HTMS based-tri-layered as compared to that of the single layered HTNPs. The electron lifetime is also associated with the interior trapping and de-trapping through the majority of traps within DSSCs. The lifetime of electrons increases with increasing bulk traps, as fast trapping and sluggish liberation of the electrons by the traps could efficiently postpone the loss of injected electrons.53,54 In this case, the hierarchical microspheres in the top layer and the mesoporous spheres in the middle layer can efficiently and effectively increase the bulk trap density and passivate the surface states, thus enhancing the electron lifetime. Moreover, to measure the recombination and charge transport characteristics in a combined way, the formula Ln = (Dnτr)1/2 was used to calculate the electron diffusion length (Ln).55 Typically, Ln denotes the average distance travelled by electrons before recombination.56 With the help of this important parameter, we can determine the suitable thickness of the film that is necessary for the effective transition of the injected electron to the external circuit. Fig. 6d demonstrates that the Ln value for the tri-layered film is longer than that of the double and single layered films in all ranges of light intensity. This result suggests that the hierarchical microspheres in the top-layer in a tri-layered photoanode with fewer grain boundaries can be highly favourable for a longer distance of electron diffusion. After all, the prominent light scattering capability and fast electron transport rate, which were verified by the diffuse reflectance spectra and IMPS measurements, significantly enhanced Jsc for HTNP + SHTMS + HTMS-tri-layered photoanode based DSSCs. The longer electron lifetime (slower electron recombination rate) within a tri-layered-based photoanode, obtained from the IMVS and EIS measurements, correlates well with its increased Voc. As a result, a superior PCE was attained for the tri-layered based DSSCs compared with the double and single layered based DSSCs.
Conclusion
In summary, a novel tri-layered TiO2 photoanode consisting of single crystal hollow TiO2 nanoparticles as a bottom layer, TiO2 sub-micro hollow mesospheres as a middle layer and TiO2 hierarchical microspheres as a top layer was prepared. The tri-layer assembly exhibits an outstanding light-harvesting capacity, a fast electron transport rate and a long electron lifetime as confirmed by the IPCE and diffuse reflectance, IMPS and IMVS results, respectively. The result can be ascribed to the special morphologies of the hollow mesospheres and hierarchical microspheres with a higher light scattering effect, and less grain boundaries and defects for efficient electron transport. Thus, the novel tri-layer design is promising for enhancing photocurrent. Consequently, DSSCs based on such tri-layered photoelectrodes (Film 4) with a total thickness of 20 μm (10 μm HTNPs + 6 μm SHTMSs + 4 μm HTMSs) produced a remarkably superior PCE of up to 9.24% compared with the DSSCs composed of Film 3 (9.11%), Film 2 (9.03%) and Film 1 (8.90%) with a similar film thickness (20 μm). We are optimistic that this kind of structural design may open up alternative ways for fabricating tri-layered photoanodes with high-performance in solar cells.
