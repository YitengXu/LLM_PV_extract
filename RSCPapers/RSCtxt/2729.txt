These nanoparticle chains without hydrothermal treatment can be used directly to fabricate photoanodes for highly efficient dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), which achieve a power conversion efficiency of 9.80% at simulated AM1.5 G illumination (100 mW cm−2). The approach presented in this study demonstrates a facile synthesis of anatase TiO2 chains for use in DSSCs, which avoid hazards arising from a hydrothermal process that is typically adopted to prepare crystalline TiO2 nanoparticles for use as the photoanode in DSSCs.
Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs)1 are promising photovoltaic devices owing to their low-cost and high efficiency.2 Nanocrystalline TiO2 is the state-of-the-art photoanode material for a DSSC to perform efficiently. The specific surface area, crystal phase, crystallinity and morphology of the TiO2 NPs (NPs) play important roles in solar cell performance.3–8 Anatase TiO2 NPs with high surface area, good crystallinity and suitable pore size are desired for high-performance DSSCs.
The performance of DSSCs depends on the particle size, pore size, and charge transport properties of the titania NP photoanode.9–11 According to the established results,9,10 smaller NPs have a higher surface area but a shorter electron diffusion length and poor light scattering ability, while larger NPs have a longer electron diffusion length and higher light scattering ability but a lower surface area. For this reason, there is an optimal particle size for the best efficiency. For example, Cao et al. concluded that a 15 nm NP was best among the 10 nm, 15 nm, and 20 nm samples,9 and Yang et al. found that long-thin nanorods (120 nm long, 17 nm wide) were better than the short-thin (50 nm long, 15 nm wide) and long-thick (150 nm long, 25 nm wide) nanorods in terms of photovoltaic performance.10 The optimal size seems to depend on the morphology of NPs.
The reported titania NPs used in efficient DSSCs are usually prepared by a sol–gel process followed by hydrothermal treatment.8–11 However, the hydrothermal treatment leads to prominent particle growth, which significantly reduces the surface area and hence dye loading. Furthermore, the hydrothermal treatment is hazardous and energy consuming, which should be avoided in large-scale production. To avoid hazards and meanwhile enhance the surface area, it is necessary to develop a mild synthetic method for anatase TiO2 NPs with both good crystallinity and high surface area.
Tiny NPs can be easily obtained from a sol–gel process, but it is unsuccessful to use the sol–gel titania NPs for fabrication of high quality titania films due to the poor crystallinity or amorphous feature. Although thermal annealing during film fabrication is able to induce crystallization of amorphous NPs, the film is easy to crack and drop off from the substrate, limiting its use in DSSCs. It thus remains a big challenge to develop well-crystallized sol–gel NPs without hydrothermal treatment so that they can form robust films with strong adhesion to the substrate. Herein, we report a facile synthesis of TiO2 NP chains through a slow hydrolysis of titanium tetraisopropoxide (TTIP) at 50 °C in the presence of a large amount of glacial acetic acid. NP chains composed of tiny NPs (∼5 nm in diameter) are obtained, which have good crystallinity in the anatase phase without subsequent hydrothermal or sintering treatment and can form crack-free films on the conductive substrate for use as the photoanode in high-performance DSSCs. The as-synthesized NP chains have a surface area as high as 309 m2 g−1, which guarantees high dye loading for efficient light harvesting. Moreover, the interconnection of NPs in the chain is expected to improve the electron diffusion length, which is an important factor influencing solar cell performance. When applied as the photoanode in DSSCs, a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 9.80% is achieved, with a short-circuit photocurrent (Jsc) of 15.67 mA cm−2, an open-circuit photovoltage (Voc) of 812 mV, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.77. Our method is different from the reported methods8–11 in particle shape and hydrothermal treatment. In particular, it is successful to get well crystallized NP chains using a low temperature sol–gel process without hydrothermal treatment for use as the efficient photoanode in highly efficient DSSCs for the first time, to the best of our knowledge.
Results and discussion
The TiO2 NPs were prepared by the hydrolysis of TTIP mixed with a large amount of glacial acetic acid (HAc) at 50 °C, as detailed in the Experimental section. The presence of a large amount of acetic acid acted as a chemical modifier of TTIP, which slowed down the hydrolysis of TTIP when water was introduced, because acetate is less hydrolysable than isopropoxy. The formed gel was very stable without sedimentation for long time storage. This means that the as-prepared titania is water soluble and very stable in the presence of HAc.

Fig. 1a illustrates the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of the as-prepared TiO2 powder dried at room temperature. The observed XRD peaks presented in Fig. 1a are attributed to anatase TiO2 (JCPDS no. 21-1272). The clear observation of strong anatase XRD peaks is indicative of good crystallinity of the as-prepared TiO2 NPs. The average nanocrystal size is calculated to be 5.3 nm based on the Scherrer equation from the strongest diffraction peak (101). As compared to the standard XRD patterns, the (004) peak is comparatively stronger while the (200) peak is comparatively weaker. Such features suggest the formation of rod-like nanocrystals with a preferred growth orientation along the c-axis of the anatase lattice.12

According to the reported methods,10,11 NPs directly obtained from a sol–gel reaction system containing 0.1 M acid or base are usually amorphous or poorly crystallized without hydrothermal treatment, and the XRD pattern is almost featureless, because hydrolysis and condensation are very fast and proceed immediately. However, when a large amount of HAc is first mixed with TTIP, the hydrolysis and condensation become slower, promoting crystallization of NPs at low temperatures. The presence of a large amount of HAc promotes polycondensation, leading to an extensive Ti–O–Ti network.12
The specific surface area and pore size distribution of the as-prepared TiO2 were characterized using nitrogen gas sorption. The type IV isotherm and H1 type hysteresis loop were observed for the as-prepared TiO2 (Fig. 1b), suggesting that the product was mesoporous. The specific surface area, calculated with the standard multi-points Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method, was 309 m2 g−1, much larger than that of the 25 nm NPs.13 The as-prepared sample shows a narrow pore size distribution centered at 5 nm (inset of Fig. 1b), revealing a homogeneous pore size in the sample. Such a high surface area is advantageous to adsorb a large amount of dye molecules, which is favourable for enhancing the light harvesting efficiency and hence the photocurrent of DSSCs.
The transmission electronic microscopy (TEM) image of the as-prepared TiO2 NPs is shown in Fig. 2a. The diameter of the particle is determined to be ∼5 nm, being consistent with the results calculated from the XRD and BET data. Small NPs of ∼5 nm in size are partially fused and interconnected together, forming a network of NP chains (Fig. 2a and its magnified picture in Fig. S1†). The high-resolution TEM image (Fig. 2b) reveals the single crystal nature of such NP chains. Interplanar distances obtained from the lattice fringe correspond to the (101), (004) and (200) crystal planes of anatase TiO2. This further confirms the preferred growth orientation of NP chains along the c-axis of the anatase lattice as observed in the XRD profile (Fig. 1a).

As the titania film should be sintered at 500 °C for 2 h in the fabrication of DSSCs, it is necessary to examine the TEM images of the sintered sample. As shown in Fig. 3, long NP chains (hundreds of nm long) are connected by small NPs. This indicates that NP chains still exist in the sintered sample. Partial fusion of adjacent NPs makes the chain boundary-free. The sintering at 500 °C for 2 h resulted in an increase in particle size from 5 to 10 nm and an increase in pore diameter from 5 to 8 nm. The BET surface area decreased significantly to 160 m2 g−1, which is still much higher than that (60 m2 g−1) of the 25 nm NPs.13

Yang and co-workers prepared similar TiO2 nanorods connected by several primary crystallites.10 As compared with their method,10 this approach is more simple, safer and lower energy-consuming. In particular, the synthesized NP chains are soluble and have good crystallinity even though hydrothermal treatment or sintering is not applied to the system.
The as-prepared TiO2 NP chains were used to fabricate TiO2 films with various thicknesses, which were sintered at 500 °C for 2 h to remove the organic binder. The films were sensitized with cis-bis(isothiocyanato) bis(2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylato) ruthenium(II) tetrabutylammonium (the so-called N719, Solaronix SA). Fig. 4a displays the incident monochromatic photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) as a function of wavelength of the fabricated DSSCs. The maximum IPCE value at 530 nm increased gradually with film thickness up to 13.9 μm due to the increased dye loading, and then changed negligibly from 13.9 to 16.5 μm. Taking the light absorption and reflection of the substrate into account, the obtained IPCE value of ∼90% at 530 nm represents a unity photon-to-electron conversion for the film thickness from 13.9 to 16.5 μm. Furthermore, the IPCE spectrum becomes broadened with film thickness, which is attributed to the increased dye loading. The integrated photocurrents were calculated from the IPCE spectra (Fig. 4a) and the standard AM1.5 G solar emission spectrum, as summarized in Table 1. It is judged from the IPCE spectra that the best film thickness falls in the range of 13.9 to 16.5 μm for efficient photoelectric conversion in a broad spectral range. The best range of film thickness is expected to generate the highest photocurrent at simulated AM1.5 G solar illumination as predicted from the trend of integrated photocurrent with film thickness (Table 1).

The performance of the above DSSCs was tested under illumination of simulated AM1.5 G solar light (100 mW cm−2), and the current–voltage characteristics are shown in Fig. 4b for each individual cell. The relationship between average photovoltaic performance parameters and film thickness is summarized in Table 1. With the increasing film thickness, Jsc increased with film thickness up to 13.9 μm, and then hardly changed with further increasing the film thickness up to 16.5 μm. The trend of Jsc was consistent with that of the integrated photocurrents. However, the measured Jsc was lower than the corresponding integrated photocurrent by about 10% for each thickness. The small pore size (8 nm for the sintered sample) of the NP chain film slowed down the diffusion of I3−/I− ions so that photocurrent generation under full sun illumination was limited by diffusion kinetics. However, under illumination of lower light intensity for IPCE measurements, much fewer dye molecules were active, and the diffusion of I3−/I− ions was fast enough to completely regenerate dye molecules. As a consequence, the integrated photocurrent was higher than the measured Jsc.
The overall trend of Voc was decreasing with film thickness. As charge recombination speeded up with film thickness as evidenced by the gradual shift of dark current onset potential to a larger value (Fig. 4b), the increased voltage loss resulting from the increased charge recombination rate led to a decrease in Voc. In contrast, the FF showed negligible change in the film thickness ranging from 5.5 to 16.5 μm. As a consequence, the PCE increased with film thickness up to 13.9 μm and remained similar with further increasing the film thickness up to 16.5 μm. Based on the relationship of photovoltaic performance with film thickness, the best film thickness was also determined in the range of 13.9 to 16.5 μm for a high PCE.
According to the above results, we fabricated another batch of TiO2 films in the thickness range of 13.9 to 16.5 μm for the purpose of achieving higher efficiency, and the best cell at 15.6 μm achieved a PCE of 9.80% with 15.67 mA cm−2 of Jsc, 812 mV of Voc, and 0.77 of FF (Fig. S2†). It is noted that the best data from this batch of films are not included in Table 1 for statistics because of different thickness and different batch of films prepared at different dates. For comparison, control DSSCs were fabricated using the 25 nm separated NPs obtained from a typical hydrothermal treatment.13 Under the comparable conditions (the same dye bath, the same electrolyte and fabrication at the same date), the best control DSSC (∼17.2 μm thick) produced a PCE of 7.69% (Jsc = 14.72 mA cm−2, Voc = 736 mV, FF = 0.71), which is much lower than that of the DSSC based on these NP chains (Fig. S2†). Evidently, the NP chains generated much higher Jsc under the comparable conditions, which is attributed to the higher dye loading arising from the higher specific surface area. Because of the higher surface area, the dye amount on the 5 nm NP chain film was 2-fold that on the 25 nm NP film with the same thickness (1 μm), as seen in Fig. S3.† Although the pore size (8 nm for the sintered sample) is small, it seems that the pore size is big enough for efficient dye adsorption as revealed by the UV-vis absorption spectra (Fig. S3†).
Owing to the high surface area, the NP chain based DSSCs could generate a PCE of 8% using an 8 μm thick film, which is a high efficiency for such a thin film. The high surface concentration of dye molecules is particularly advantageous to enhance the light harvesting efficiency and IPCE in the long wavelength region, where extinction coefficients are low and decrease gradually with wavelength.8 Therefore, the DSSC with the NP chains produced much higher IPCE (Fig. S4a†) particularly in the longer wavelength region (Fig. S4b†) and exhibited a more broadened IPCE profile than the 25 nm NPs.
In addition to the important influence of surface area, charge transport and recombination also affect the photovoltaic performance. To elucidate the charge transfer kinetics in DSSCs, intensity modulated photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS) was performed to determine the electron lifetime (τ), intensity modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) was performed to derive the time constants for determination of electron diffusion coefficients (D),14,15 and a charge extraction technique was used to extract the charge density (Q). Fig. 5 compares the electron lifetimes against charge density of NP chains and separated 25 nm NPs. The logarithm of electron lifetime decreases linearly with the logarithm of charge density,14 and the slope is similar for the two cases. At the same charge density, the electron lifetime of the NP chains is longer than that of the separated NPs by 4.5-fold. The electron diffusion coefficient of the 25 nm separated NPs obtained from the hydrothermal treatment is 2.5-fold that of the as-prepared NP chains (Fig. 6). The hydrothermally treated 25 nm NPs exhibit faster electron diffusion than the 5 nm NP chains without hydrothermal treatment. This is likely because the hydrothermally treated sample has a better crystallinity and lower surface area than the sol–gel product.16

 Fig. 6  Electron diffusion coefficient against charge density. 
Despite the higher surface area offering more traps and electron acceptors for charge recombination, the electron lifetime of the NP chains is much longer than that of the separated NPs. The longer electron lifetime of the NP chains may be related to their slower electron diffusion rate.17 In addition, the diffusion of triiodide is limited by such a small pore size.9,11 The pore size is very small so that triiodide ions cannot penetrate the pores effectively.9 The surface concentration of triiodide is thus decreased due to the diffusion limitation, and the charge recombination rate is consequently lowered with the reduced surface concentration of triiodide ions.14,16 As a result, although the NP chains have a very high surface area, a longer electron lifetime is observed.
The electron diffusion length (L = (D × τ)1/2) of the NP chains is larger than that of the 25 nm NPs by more than 30% (Fig. 7). This indicates that the NP chains are superior to the separated 25 nm NPs for use as the photoanode in DSSCs.18 As compared to the 25 nm separated NPs, the higher specific surface area in combination with the longer electron diffusion length of the NP chains accounts for their higher photocurrent. Owing to the high surface area, the NP chain film may be suitable for solid-state solar cells, in which a thin film is desired. The NP chains exhibit a higher open-circuit photovoltage due to the larger electron lifetime along with the higher photocurrent.14
 Fig. 7  Comparison of electron diffusion lengths for 5 nm NP chains and 25 nm separated NPs. 
According to the literature,9,10 it is difficult for NPs as small as 5 nm to achieve high efficiency. However, we obtained high efficiency using small NPs because these small NPs partially fused into long NP chains, which are not small and similar to nanorods.10 Considering the fact that long-thin nanorods achieve high efficiency, it is reasonable for the NP chains to yield high performance.
Conclusions
In summary, nanocrystalline anatase TiO2 NP chains are obtained at low temperatures without subsequent hydrothermal treatment. The large surface area, which enables high dye adsorption, in combination with the NP chain feature, which slows down charge recombination and enhances the electron diffusion length, is responsible for the obtained high efficiency. The high surface area makes it possible for a thin film to harvest incident light efficiently, which is expected to improve efficiency significantly because a thin film is favourable for high photovoltage generation. This approach, making the preparation processes of TiO2 much easier and safer, facilitates massive production and offers an effective pathway for the improvement of efficiency and the reduction of cost as well.
Experimental section
Synthesis of TiO2 NP chains
50 ml TTIP was added dropwise to 100 ml HAc under vigorous stirring. No precipitate was formed during this procedure. Afterwards, 300 ml water was added dropwise into the above solution within 10 min under vigorous stirring. A white precipitate was formed at the beginning, which was then changed to a clear solution. The mixture, which was heated at 50 °C under stirring for 10 h, gradually became turbid and finally became a bluish gel. The as-prepared powder and the sintered sample at 500 °C for 2 h were used to perform the corresponding characterizations such as XRD and TEM.
DSSC fabrication and evaluation
Titania paste was prepared by mixing 100 ml of TiO2 solution in ethanol (10 mg cm−3), 0.45 g ethyl cellulose (TCI) and 3.5 g α-terpineol (Acros) followed by the removal of ethanol on a rotary evaporator at a reduced pressure. TiO2 films (5 mm × 5 mm) composed of the as-prepared NP chains or the separated 25 nm NPs were fabricated by screen-printing the paste onto the conductive glass (F-doped SnO2, FTO, 14 Ω per square, a transmittance of 85%, Nippon Sheet Glass Co., Japan). The dye sensitizer used in this work was cis-di(isothiocyanato)-bis-(2,2-bipyridyl-4,4-dicarboxylato) ruthenium(II) bis-tetrabutyl ammonium (the so-called N719, used as received from Solaronix SA) (0.3 mM in a mixed solvent of acetonitrile and tert-butanol in a volume ratio of 1:1). Sealed DSSC devices sandwiched with the redox electrolyte (0.1 M LiI, 0.05 M I2, 0.6 M 1,2-dimethyl-3-n-propylimidazolium iodide, and 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine in anhydrous acetonitrile) were fabricated for evaluation of photovoltaic performance. A Keithley-2420 sourcemeter in combination with a Sol3A class AAA solar simulator IEC/JIS/ASTM equipped with an AM1.5 G filter and a 450 W xenon lamp was used to measure the current–voltage curves. The intensity of white light was calibrated with a reference silicon solar cell (Oriel-91150). To avoid stray light, a black mask with an aperture area of 0.2354 cm2 was put on the surface of devices during measurements. Anti-reflection films were not used to reduce the incident light losses. Incident monochromatic photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) as a function of wavelength was recorded on an Oriel-74125 system (Oriel Instruments). The intensity of monochromatic light was measured with a Si detector (Oriel-71640).
Characterizations
X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed on a D8 Advance diffractometer (Bruker, Cu Kα radiation: λ = 0.154 nm). High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) was carried out on a JEM-2100F (JEOL) microscope and a Tecnai G2 20 TWIN (FEI, USA) microscope. The specific surface area was measured with a Micromeritics ASAP2020 nitrogen adsorption–desorption apparatus. The UV-vis spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu UV-2550 UV-vis spectrometer. An electrochemical workstation (ZAHNER ZENNIUM CIMPS-1, Germany) was used to perform intensity modulated photocurrent/photovoltage spectroscopy (IMPS/IMVS) and charge extraction under illumination of a green light emitting diode (LED, 532 nm). The intensity-modulated spectra were recorded at room temperature with light intensity ranging from 0.5 to 45 W m−2 in modulation frequency ranging from 0.1 Hz to 10 kHz with modulation amplitude less than 5% of the light intensity.
