    , Accepted 21st January 2016First published on 25th January 2016AbstractOrganic upconversion is a unique process in which low-energy light (usually NIR light) is converted to high-energy light through either the two-photon absorption (TPA) mechanism or the triplet–triplet annihilation (TTA) mechanism. Both TPA upconversion (TPA-UC) and TTA upconversion (TTA-UC) have been actively investigated in recent years due to their intriguing applications in optics, biophotonics, and solar energy utilization. Although they show some similarity (i.e., belonging to the nonlinear two-quantum process and needing focused excitation light), TPA-UC and TTA-UC are very different, such as in mechanism, characteristics involved, molecular design and potential applications. Here, we collectively reviewed these two kinds of upconversion processes and compared their respective characteristics and merits. We also present recent advances made in the areas of TPA- and TTA-UC, the remaining challenges and opportunities, with particular emphasis on molecular engineering of these two active upconversion materials.

1. Introduction
Organic molecular photon-upconversion (UC) can convert two low-energy photons into one higher-energy photon by either the two-photon absorption (TPA) mechanism1 or the triplet–triplet annihilation (TTA) mechanism.2 The two-photon absorption (TPA) can be described by the two-state model3 or the three-state model4,5 that a molecule can be excited from the ground state (S0) to the first excited singlet state (S1) or to the second excited singlet state (S2) by simultaneous absorption of two photons, via a virtual state. It is the virtual state (see Fig. 1a) that makes two-photon absorption require high excitation power density as large as more than MW cm−2, which was only achieved by an ultrafast laser. After two photons are absorbed to produce an excited state, the relaxation of an electron would give rise to the emission of a photon with frequency greater that those of the absorbed photons, that is, TPA upconversion (TPA-UC). Importantly, the TPA shows quadratic intensity dependence and possesses the overwhelming advantages of high spatial resolution and deep medium penetration, which can bring about numerous potential applications in biophotonics (fluorescence bioimaging6–9 and photodynamic therapy10), optics (two-photon data storage11 and frequency upconverted lasing12,13) and nano-micro fabrication.14

The other organic upconversion is triplet–triplet annihilation upconversion (TTA-UC) (see Fig. 1b). This TTA-UC needs a bimolecular system containing a triplet sensitizer and a triplet acceptor (i.e., emitter).15 The sensitizer firstly absorbs low-power light, then undergoes intersystem crossing (ISC) and further transfers its triplet energy to the triplet state of the acceptor (TTT). Subsequently two nearby triplet acceptors undergo triplet–triplet annihilation (TTA), producing a frequency-upconverted fluorescence (i.e. TTA upconversion).15 Since TTA-UC undergoes the inter-molecular two respective one-photon process that is transition allowed and just needs low excitation intensity (less than 100 mW cm−2, solar energy is enough).16 Thus, attractive solar energy applications, including photovoltaics,17–19 photosynthesis20 and photocatalysis,21 would be possible.
Although TPA-UC and TTA-UC possess different mechanisms, both belong to a nonlinear two-quantum process and need focused excitation light. The former involves a one-step intra-molecular two-photon excitation process through a virtual state which imposes certain symmetry restrictions. It also requires high excitation intensity thus necessitating the use of short pulse lasers with high peak intensities. In contrast, triplet–triplet annihilation upconversion utilizes an intermolecular process in which two neighboring molecules in triplet excited states produced by respective one photon excitation, interacting to lead one molecule to the emitting higher energy state and the other dropping to the ground state. Thus even though the annihilation behaves like a nonlinear process, it actually involves coupling of two linear excitations, which can be generated by using an intensity CW laser or even an incoherent lamp. There is no symmetry requirement for TTA.
Currently, there are several reviews already existed, which deal with these two upconversion processes independently, none have described them collectively. This review described comparatively these two kinds of photon upconversion (UC) concluding their characteristics, measurements and the active materials as well as notable applications.
2. Two-photon absorption upconversion (TPA-UC)
The concept of two-photon absorption (TPA) was firstly put forward by M. Göpper-Mayer in 1931.22 She theoretically predicted that a molecule could simultaneously absorb two photons from the ground state (S0) to the excited state (S1) under the very intensity excitation. Then, the intensity change (dI) of the light beam shows quadratic dependence of the input light intensity (eqn (1)),23 where β is the two-photon absorption coefficient (in unit of cm GW−1). The relationship between β and the two-photon absorption cross-section (σTPA, in unit of cm4 GW−1) is expressed in eqn (2),24 where NA is Avogadro's number and d0 is the molar concentration of the absorbing molecules (in units of mol dm−3). With different units for two-photon absorbability, the organic molecular TPA cross-section can be expressed using eqn (3),25 where hν is the photon energy of the excitation light. δTPA is the TPA cross-section in units of GM, i.e., the name abbreviation of Göpper-Mayer (1 GM = 10−50 cm4 s photon−1). (1) β = 10−3NAd0σTPA(2) δTPA = hνσTPA(3)
When two photons were absorbed by a chromophore, the produced excited state would relax and give rise to the emission with the frequency greater than those of the absorbed photons. Usually, the two-photon excited emission (TPA-UC) includes two kinds: i.e., the stimulated lasing (TPA lasing) and the upconverted fluorescence (TPA fluorescence), which depend on the direction of collectible emission. The strong TPA-UC is extremely attractive for numerous applications such as light-emitting diodes (LEDs), photovoltaics and biomedicine. Besides, the most intriguing application is that it can offer high-energy coherent light sources in the short wavelength region which could create new advantages and breakthroughs in various laser-based applications.26 Compared to conventional one-photon lasing, the two-photon lasing can make the two-photon excitation wavelength shift to longer wavelengths where organic molecules are relatively photo-stable. (4) δTPF = δTPA × ΦF(5)
TPA lasing efficiency (ηTPA) can be calculated by the ratio of Eout/Ein or the ratio of Iout/Iin (eqn (4)),27 where Eout and Ein are the lasing energy and the excitation light energy, respectively; Iout and Iin are the lasing intensity and the excitation light intensity, respectively. While the TPA-UC efficiency (ΦTPA) can be evaluated by the two-photon fluorescence (TPF) cross-section (δTPF) that is defined by δTPA × ΦF (see eqn (5)),28 where δTPA and ΦF are the molecular TPA cross-section and one-photon fluorescence quantum yield, respectively. An active TPA-UC chromophore should possess large TPA cross-section (δTPA) with high fluorescence quantum yield (ΦF), which presents a useful criterion to design and synthesize new active chromophores. Theoretically, the organic molecular δTPA value is related to the imaginary part of the third-order polarizability γ(−ω; ω, ω, −ω), as shown in eqn (6),29, 30 where h is Plank's constant, n is the index of refraction of the medium, L is a local field factor (equal to 1 for vacuum), and c or ω is the speed of light or the frequency of light. As for material scientists and chemists, eqn (7)29, 30 is possibly more comprehensible, where Mge or Mee′ is the transition dipole moment between the ground state (S0) and the excited state (S1) or between S1 and the higher excited state (S2). Ege or Ege′ is the energy difference between S0 and S1 or the S1 and the higher excited state (S2). Δμge is the molecular dipole moment difference between S0 and S1. Except the third term in eqn (7), the first two terms make positive contribution to the TPA process. These parameters can be calculated by theoretical calculations.31 Also, the parameter Δμge can be obtained according to the Lippert–Mataga equation (eqn (8)32) where Δν and Δf represent the molecular Stokes shift in different solvents and the orientation polarizability of solvent, respectively; Δμge is the molecular dipole moment difference between S0 and S1. C is the constant, while c and α are the light speed and the molecular cavity radius. ℏ is Plank's constant divided by 2π. One can see from eqn (9) that Δf is related to the dielectric constant (ε) and the refractive index (n) of solvent. So, the linear relationship of Δν and Δf can be plotted and the Δμge value can be obtained in slope. (6) (7) (8) (9)
Based on these parameters such as Mee′ and Δμge, the TPA cross-section can be predicted. Since small TPA cross-section of molecular dyes needs to use more intense laser beams, developing various active materials for enhancement TPA cross-section (δTPA) is necessary. As for the molecule engineering, chromophore design strategies aim at extending the conjugated length, changing the character of the conjugated bridge and increasing the molecular planarity as well as enhancing the donor (D) and acceptor (A) strength, which more often than not can augment TPA-UC. So far, principles and guidelines for molecular engineering that can enhance the TPA cross-section of dipolar,33,34 quadrupolar,35,36 octupolar37,38 and dentritic39,40 chromophores have been well developed. Among them, the linear conjugation structures and the branching/dendritic motifs are the typical candidates.
2.1 The linear structures
Generally, there are two molecular types for linear structures, i.e., asymmetrical D–π–A type and symmetrical D–π–D (or A–π–A) type. From the 1990s onwards, Prasad's group has done lots of pioneering studies in developing D–π–A dyes,41–44 where the typical upconverted lasing chromophores are (E)-4-[p-(N-hydroxyethyl-N-methyl)amino] styryl-N-methylpyridinium iodide (ASPI), 4-(dimethylamino)-N-methylstilbazoliumtosylate (DAST) and (E)-4-[N-(2-hydroxyethyl-N-methyl)aminophenyl]-4′(6-hydroxyhexylsulphon-yl) stilbene (APSS) (Fig. 2). The reported TPA lasing efficiency (ηTPA) for ASPI in benzyl alcohol was as high as ∼17% (at 600 nm), when excited by a focused 1064 nm laser (∼10 ns).41 Dye ASPT doped bulk polymer rods present TPA lasing at ∼600 with an efficiency of 3.5% (ηTPA) when pumped at 1064 nm (∼10 ns).42 As an extension of this work, we have synthesized a series of styrylpyridine derivatives (Fig. 2), in order to further understand the structure-performance correlations.45 These styrylpyridine chromophores in DMF solution present red upconversion lasing with the largest efficiency (ηTPA) at 10.7% for DEASPI and the smallest one at 0.13% for CSPI, when excited by a 1064 nm (40 ps) mode-locked Nd:YAG laser (at 2.14 mJ input energy). Experiments have demonstrated that the anions, such as iodine ions (I−), CH3SO4− and CH3PhSO4−, the molecular environments and the solution concentration have an important influence on the TPA lasing efficiency.46 Following further investigation by the quantum chemical calculations, we found that TPA lasing (ηTPA) shows positive correlation to intramolecular charge-transfer, expressed by the decreasing bond length alternation (BLA) and the increasing charge density distribution (Δρ1,2).45

In 1998, M. Albota and co-workers put forward the concept of symmetrical charge-transfer and further reasoned that symmetrical bis(styryl)benzene derivatives (Fig. 3) could dramatically enhance TPA absorbing in comparison with model (E)-bis(di-n-butylamino)stilbene (BDBAS).47The TPA cross-section of the bis(styryl)benzene derivative (R = OMe, n = 2) is as large as 1250 GM at 775 nm, showing an almost 6-fold increase, relative to model BDBAS (210 GM at 600 nm) (Fig. 3). This is interpreted to increase the change in the transition dipole moments.4 Using the extending symmetrical D–π–D chromophores, B. H. Cumpston and his coworkers48 investigated the structure–property with TPA cross-section and the application of two-photon-initiated polymerization. Experimental and theoretical studies confirmed that enhanced δTPA was correlated with the degree of symmetrical intramolecular charge-transfer. By nanosecond pulse excitation, they observed that bis(styryl)benzene derivatives present a combination of large δTPA and high fluorescence or triplet quantum yield. Such merits are especially available in TPA polymerization based three-dimensional (3D) microfabrication. Since TPA possesses the advantages of high spatial resolution and deep medium penetration, they can achieve high density three-dimensional (3D) optical data storage by writing bits in a thick medium (>100 μm).48

In the development of new large TPA molecules, we have synthesized some pn-junction based “D–A–D′–A–D” and “(D–A)n” chromophores (Fig. 4).49,50 Relative to NT-G1 (215 GM),50 pn-junction style chromophores SO-G1 (δTPA, 377 GM) and NO-G1 (δTPA, 454 GM) present higher TPA cross-section values, according to the two-photon fluorescence (TPF) method by the Ti:sapphire femtosecond laser. As such, triphenylamine-based pn-junction oligomer P1 displays the greatest TPA coefficient (β, 2.5 × 10−11 cm W−1) among oligomers P1–P3 due to P1 presenting the more obvious pn-junction feature and larger intramolecular charge-transfer from triphenylamine (as donor) to naphthalene (as acceptor).51 Since the TPA cross-section is determined by two-photon fluorescence measurement, large δTPA means high upconversion, which would have potential applications in fluorescence microscopy and bioimaging.

Whether symmetrical or asymmetrical structures have larger TPA cross-section? In 2000, Kim and co-workers synthesized D–π–D and D–π–A dithienothiophene (DTT)-centered chromophores (101–104) (Fig. 5a).52 The measurements are carried out under identical conditions and the results showed that the δTPA value of symmetrical 101 (1050 GM) is more than 3-fold larger than the asymmetrical 102 (335 GM); while the δTPA of symmetrical 103 (1990 GM) shows a 1.7-fold increase, relative to the asymmetrical analogues 104 (1190 GM). The finding that symmetrical intramolecular charge-transfer possesses larger TPA cross-section is of importance since it would be helpful for active TPA molecule engineering. In 2001, we investigated the influence of molecular symmetry upon active TPA based on theoretical calculations correlative with the corresponding experimental measurements.53 Calculation results showed that symmetrical stilbene derivatives exhibit a larger transition dipole moment (Mee′ = 12–15 D) than the asymmetrical counterparts (Mee′ = 6–10 D), while asymmetrical structures have a larger dipole moment difference (Δμge = 3–12 D) than symmetrical ones (Δμge = ∼0 D) (Fig. 5b), which revealed that the TPA cross-section mainly depend on the amount of transition dipole moment (Mee′).53,54

In 2008, Prasad's group reported that the symmetrical ladder-type fluorine-based chromophores (nFL, n = 1–4) presented highly enhanced TPA cross-section (Fig. 6a).55 Measured by the nonlinear transmission method, the δTPA values were increased from 1FL (584 GM), 2FL (853 GM), and 3FL (1280 GM) to 4FL (1846 GM). Due to their enhanced two-photon response, these ladder-type oligofluorene chromophores provide the advantages of a higher signal/noise ratio, better optical limiting and lower power requirement for the excitation source.55 Later on, the Blanchard-Desce group synthesized two prolonged phenanthrene-based chromophores 10 and 11 (Fig. 6a) for the application of the two-photon upconverted imaging in the biological membranes.6 Under excitation of a mode locked Ti/sapphire laser (80 fs pulses, 80 MHz), the δTPA values are measured to be 3310 GM for 10 and 3760 GM for 11, showing more than 2 orders of magnitude larger than the standard fluorophore fluorescein (30 GM).6 This noticeable increase is due to their semi-rigid extending conjugation to the nanoscale rod.6

Usually, two-photon absorption properties exhibited by the organic molecules in solution are quenched in the solid state due to aggregation. However, efficiently luminescent materials in the solid-state form are highly desired in many photonic applications such as TPA lasing and light emission of OLEDs. In order to develop new chromophores with high aggregation-induced upconversion, Prasad's group synthesized a kind of symmetrical 9,10-bis[4′-(4′′-aminostyryl)styryl]anthracene (BDSA-Bz) with enhanced TPA-UC by nanoaggregation. (Fig. 6b).56BDSA-Bz showed weak fluorescence in organic solvent owing to its large internal rotation in the monomer form; however, once its nanoaggregation is formed in water, the internal rotation is considerably hindered and leads to a significant increase of TPA cross-section (δTPA = 217 GM) and fluorescence quantum yield (ΦF = 13%), relative to it in solution (δTPA = 172 GM, ΦF = 2%). And the TPF cross-section (δTPF) is increased from 15 (in solution) to 101 (in aggregation), which shows the potential application in three-dimensional fluorescence bioimaging.56 Also, they found that BDSA-Bz modified silica nanoparticles can obviously exhibit the aggregation-enhanced TPA-UC which can act as an energy donor to react with the acceptor of a photosensitizing PDT drug.56 In 2007, they have prepared the stable aqueous dispersions of co-encapsulating nanoparticles in the nonpolar interior of micelles by co-precipitating an organically modified silica sol with the photosensitizer (BDSA, Fig. 6b).57 Using a multidisciplinary nanophotonic approach, indirect excitation of this photosensitizer can achieve intrapaticle energy-transfer from the dye aggregates and generates singlet oxygen that produces an in vitro cytotoxic effect in tumour cells by photosensitization under two-photon irradiation.57 Another interesting nanoaggregation molecule is 1,4-bis(cyanostyryl)benzene-based triphenylamine isomer (CSB-TP).58 Changing the position of the cyano group within CSB-TP afforded α-CSB-TP and β-CSB-TP isomers (Fig. 6b). The resulting fluorescence wavelength was shifted to 586 nm and the TPA cross-section was increased at 357 nm for β-CSB-TP, relative to α-CSB-TP (530 nm, 297 GM), when using the Ti-sapphire laser with 130 femtosecond (fs) pulses, which can be used to prepare the fluorescent organic nanoparticles with readily tunable emission colour.58
2.2 The branch/dendrimer structures
In 1999, Prasad and co-workers reported that triphenylamine-based branched chromophores have shown their TPA cross-section increasing with the branching number.59 This phenomenon was firstly recognized to be the cooperative enhancement effect. As shown in Fig. 7a, the TPA cross-sections of one-branched (PRL-101), two-branched (PRL-501) and three-branched (PRL-701) chromophores in tetrachloroethane solvent were measured at 60 × 10−20, 208 × 10−20 and 587 × 10−20 cm4 GW−1, determined with nanosecond pulses at 810 nm.59 Later on, this “cooperative effect” has been found in many other branched or dendrimeric systems, such as triazine-based,60–62 2,4,6-alkylpyridinium-based,63,64 1,3,5-tricyanobenzene-based,65–67 truxene-based68 and porphyrins-based.69,70 Among them, the triphenylamine group is regarded as the most typical “core”,71–75 since the triphenylamine group possesses more active sites that make the branching synthesis easy and it is a perfect donor that can effectively enhance intramolecular charge transfer with the result of increasing the TPA cross-section. For instance, the triphenylamine-based branch-2 possesses a 17-fold increase in TPA cross-section (1562 GM), relative to branch-1 (Fig. 7b).76 Combining the theoretical calculations and experimental measurements, we found that only one of the three branches within triphenylamine-branched chromophores shows larger excited charge redistribution, while other branch(es) show(s) negligible excited charge-transfer (Fig. 7c, T1–T3).77
 Fig. 7  Triphenylamine-based branched chromophores and TPA cross-sections. 
In 2003, Rebane's group also confirmed the strong cooperative enhancement of TPA in triphenylamine-based dendritic systems (Fig. 8).78,79 After systematic measurements, they found that the maximum TPA cross-section (δTPA) was increased from compd. 2 (320 GM), to 4 (1330 GM) until 6 (2700 GM), in proportion to N2 (where N is the triphenylamine group). By a femtosecond pulse laser, the measured two-photon absorption cross-section (δTPA) of dendrimer 8 (4SG2) was as high as 1 × 104 GM. This enhancement is facilitated by the quasi-planar conjugated structure that presents direct inter-branch charge-transfer throughout the molecules.78,79 Using the small substituent group attached to the branched chromophore has no obvious contribution to TPA enhancement.80
 Fig. 8  Molecular structures of BDPAS (2)-based dendrimers 4, 6 and 8. 
One of the advantages of triphenylamine-based branched molecules is that the triphenylamine “core” can connect more functional branching, which usually bring about the optimized properties by TPA-UC detection. More recently, we synthesized three triphenylamine-based molecules containing one, two and three of 7-pyridinylbenzo[c][1,2,5] thiadiazole group(s) (TPTZ-n, n = 1–3, Fig. 9a).81 Relative to TPTZ-1, the TPA-UC showed a 2-fold enhancement for TPTZ-3 and 1.5-fold enhancement for TPTZ-2. The cross-section values (δTPA) are increased from TPTZ-1 (121 GM) to TPTZ-2 (184 GM) to TPTZ-3 (254 GM). Using TPA-UC detection, choosing TPZ-1 to detect Cu2+ by TPA-UC and down-conversion fluorescence, respectively, the former showed 10-fold enhanced sensitivity relative to the latter since the quenching constant of TPA-UC (k2PSV) is at 13.6 mM−1 and that of down-conversion fluorescence (k1PSV) at 1.77 mM−1.81 Also, the branched molecules with functional branching possess more sensitivity. For example, when detecting Ni2+, the quenching constants (k1PSV) of TPZ-1, TPZ-2 and TPZ-3 are demonstrated at 1.70 mM−1, 2.32 mM−1 and 4.30 mM−1, respectively.81
 Fig. 9  The branched structures of TPTZ-n (n = 1–3) (a) and ET-101, PRL-501 and PRL-406 (b). 
For the purpose of investigating the influence of branching, “core” and the resulting dendritic molecules upon TPA cross-section (σTPA), respectively, Prasad and co-workers investigated three new chromophores (PRL-501, PRL-406 and ET-101, Fig. 9b) using the femtosecond Z-scan technique.82 The σTPA values of PRL-501 (branching), PRL-406 (cored-unit) and ET-101 (dendrimer) are 0.73 × 10−20, 0.26 × 10−20 and 1.52 × 10−20 cm4 GM−1, respectively. That is, the σTPA value is in the order of dendrimer > branching > core. For the conjugated dendrimers, they would display efficient fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) from the branching to the “core”. Compared with the direct excitation of the “core”, this FRET can bring out a significant increase in the emission of the “core” unit when the excitation takes place on the branching molecules.71 This “antenna effect” can occur in other branching systems such as porphyrin-cored69 and dibenzothiophene-cored83 branching chromophores. As shown in Fig. 10, using one-photon excitation (at 420 nm, Xe lamp) and two-photon excitation (at 800 nm, laser), respectively, the porphyrin-cored molecule emits not only strong down-conversion but also strong TPA-UC fluorescence, locating at ∼650 and ∼725 nm. Meanwhile, with indirect excitation by either 300 nm (Xe lamp) or 532 nm (laser), this branched sample also presented the same down- and up-conversion fluorescence, resulting from intramolecular energy transfer and the “antenna effect”.69

As described above, the branched and dendritic molecules have the merits such as TPA enhancement and optimized performances. Another important benefit is that it can provide an effective approach to enhance TPA without the maximum TPA absorption shifting. In 2008, we found that chromophores TOZ-2 and TOZ-4 (Fig. 11) in THF emit strong TPA-UC, when pumped by a Ti: sapphire femtosecond laser pulse at 800 nm.84 Using the TPF methods, TOZ-4 possesses a δTPA value as large as 5254 GM, showing ∼3 times larger than that of TOZ-2 (1804 GM), while both have the identical maximum absorption including one-photon and two-photon peaks.84 In search of the trade-off effect between two-photon absorptivity and the maximum absorption position, we also synthesized the naphthaline-cored dendrimers85 that exhibit increasing TPA with the generation number from 1 (Np-G1, 959 GM), to 2 (Np-G2, 5582 GM), to 3 (NP-G3, 9575 GM) (Fig. 12a). Their maximum linear absorption positions are proved to fix at ∼415 nm, indicating that a trade-off between optical transparency and NLO performance (two-photon absorption) can exist in dendritic architectures (Fig. 12b). Moreover, these dendrimers can successfully initiate the acrylate resins to two-photon polymerization (TPP) with the efficiency increasing with the generation number. As shown in Fig. 13, the TPP processes were involved in two-photon absorption (excitation), then intramolecular energy transfer and intermolecular electron transfer between the initiator and MMA monomer to obtain very regular diamond structures with submicron size.85

3. Triplet–triplet annihilation upconversion (TTA-UC)
Different from the TPA-UC, the other organic upconversion is triplet–triplet annihilation based upconversion (TTA-UC) that was first introduced by Parker and Hatchard over 50 years ago.86 The TTA-UC phenomenon undergoes a series of quantum processes that involve a bimolecular system containing a sensitizer and an acceptor.87 Firstly, the sensitizer harvests the excitation energy toward its triplet excited state by intersystem crossing (ISC). Secondly, the sensitizer shifts its triplet energy to the acceptor, which is called triplet–triplet energy transfer (TTT). Thirdly, two excited triplet acceptors encounter each other and produce one excited singlet state (S1) and one ground state (S0), which is called triplet–triplet annihilation (TTA). Lastly, the S1 state decays from the excited state to the ground state and irradiates the upconversion fluorescence. Since the processes mentioned above, including ISC, TTT and TTA etc. are transition-allowed, the TTA-UC can achieve at ultra-low excitation power less than the terrestrial solar radiation (ca. 100 mW cm−2). The overall upconversion capability (ηTTA) can be evaluated by eqn (10),88 where ε and ΦISC are the molar extinction coefficient and the intersystem crossing (ISC) of the sensitizer; ΦUC is the upconversion efficiency of the acceptor. ηTTA = ε × ΦISC × ΦUC(10) (11) ΦUC = ΦTTT × ΦTTA × ΦF(12)
The upconversion efficiency (ΦUC) can be calculated based on eqn (11),89 where the subscript “s” and “r” represent the sample (i.e., sensitizer or acceptor) and the reference (for example, rhodamine 6G or coumarin etc.), respectively. Φr is the fluorescence quantum yield of the reference. Ar and As are the absorbance of the reference and sensitizer, respectively. Fr and Fs are the integrated emission of the reference and the acceptor under the excitation of the sensitizer. nr and ns are the refractive indices of the solvent dissolving sample and the reference, respectively. The factor 2 accounts for the fact that two absorbed photons are required to produce one upconverted photon.2 According to eqn (12),90 one can see that the upconversion efficiency (ΦUC) is relevant to the fluorescence quantum yield (ΦF) of the acceptor, the triplet–triplet energy transfer efficiency (ΦTTT) and the triplet–triplet annihilated efficiency (ΦTTA). Qualitatively, a sensitizer with a long-lived triplet state (T1) will present high TTT efficiency (ΦTTA) since the successful TTT process needs a large Dexter distance and resulting effective diffusion in order to ensure the contact of the sensitizer and acceptor. Quantitatively, TTT efficiency (ΦTTT) can be evaluated by the Stern–Volmer equation (eqn (13)),91 where I0 and I are the phosphorescence intensities of the sensitizer without and with acceptor, respectively. Ksv, [Q] and τ0 are the Stern–Volmer constant, the concentration (mol dm−3) of the acceptor and the lifetime of the triplet excited state of the sensitizer, respectively. kq is the phosphorescence quenching constant that is proportional to the TTT efficiency (ΦTTA). I0/I = Ksv[Q] + 1 = kq·τ0[Q] + 1(13) (14) (15)
On the other hand, triplet–triplet annihilation efficiency (ΦTTA) can be estimated according to eqn (14) and (15).92 By means of the laser flash photolysis measurements, the absorption difference spectra of the sensitizer (ΔAS) and acceptor (ΔAA) can be obtained. Then, the triplet extinction coefficient (3εA) of the acceptor can be obtained if the triplet molar extinction coefficient (3εS) of the sensitizer is known. So, the TTA rate constant (kTTA) that can stand for the TTA annihilation efficiency (ΦTTA) can be calculated according to eqn (15).93 Here, [3M*]0 and [3M*]t represent the concentration (in the units of mol dm−3) of the triplet acceptor when t = 0 and t = t (t is the time). The latter (3[M*]t) is equal to the molar extinction coefficient (3εA) value. kT is the triplet decay rate constant of the acceptor, which can be obtained by fitting the transient absorption decay also the laser flash photolysis measurements.93 (16)
Theoretically, two triplet acceptors (3A1*) undergo the TTA process that are governed by the spin statistic law (eqn (16)).94 That is, when two excited triplets (3A1*) interact, nine encounter-pair spin states are produced with equal probability which are composed of three distinct sublevels: i.e., five of which are quintet (5[AA]2*), three of which are triplet (3[AA]1*) and one of which is singlet (1[AA]0*). Based on this spin statistics, the quintet state (5A2*), the triplet state (3A1*) and the singlet state (1A0*) will have 5/9 (55.6%), 3/9 (33.3%) and 1/9 (11.1%) chances, respectively, to decay into the triplet excited state (3A1*),95 thus the maximal upconversion quantum yield from the singlet state (1A0*) will be no higher than 11.1% (1/9).2 However, many groups report the results that the obtained ΦUC exceeds this limit (11.1%)96–101 and suggest that both the triplets and the quintets have also contributed to the upconversion efficiency.
3.1 Solution-based upconversion
Castellano's group has made a lot of pioneering studies in developing different TTA-UC systems which show short wavelength emission in the UV-vis range when excited at longer wavelength even in the NIR regions.93,102–105 Among them, the green-to-blue upconversion based on bimolecular PdOEP/DPA (octaethyl-porphyrinatopalladium(II)/9,10-diphenylanthracene) has been investigated extensively due to DPA possessing high fluorescence quantum yield (ΦF = 0.95) and a suitable triplet energy level (ET1 = 1.77 eV) matched with the sensitizer PdOEP. In 2005, Castellano's group comparatively investigated the upconversion efficiencies of DPA and anthracene (An) doped with the identical sensitizer Ru(dmb)3.102 They found that the upconversion intensity of DPA approximately achieves a 24.4-fold enhancement, relative to anthracene (An) as an emitter, which is attributed to DPA's increased singlet fluorescence quantum yield (ΦF = 0.95) with respect to anthracene (ΦF = 0.27) (Table 1). This reveals that choosing the suitable triplet acceptor with high fluorescence quantum yield (ΦF) is the key factor for the TTA-UC system. The other green-to-blue upconversion system is the Ir(ppy)3 (ppy = 2-phenylpyridine)/pyrene bimolecular system (Fig. 14). Excitation of the MLCT band of Ir(ppy)3 can produce blue upconverted fluorescence that originates from pyrene (Table 1).103 If high concentrations of pyrene was used, upconversion located at 470 nm was observed, which results from the pyrene excimer.103 So, the effective simultaneous sensitization of both singlet pyrene and the pyrene excimer is valuable since it would compose white light with respect to monochromatic incident photons. Meanwhile, Castellano's group designed covalent binding of a sensitizer-acceptor chromophore and investigated the upconversion efficiency in comparison with the sensitizer/acceptor bimolecular system. Under identical experimental conditions, the efficiency (ΦUC) of intermolecular [Ru(dmb)3]2+/anthracene (An) is almost 3-fold increased relative to that of intramolecular [Ru(dmb)3]2+/anthracene (An) (Fig. 14).104,105 This suggests that the sensitizer-acceptor containing chromophore tends to undergo Foster type singlet–singlet transfer, where the Dexter energy–energy transfer is made.106

 Fig. 14  Molecular structures of sensitizers and acceptors generating green-to-blue upconversion. 
Recently, we reported several green-to-blue systems containing DPA-derivatives (such as DTA, DTACl DTACN and DTACO2Me). (Fig. 14).107 Selective excitation of PdOEP (532 nm, 0.5 W cm−2) in DMF resulted in anti-Stokes blue emission at 430–450 nm. The maximum upconversion quantum yield (ΦUC = 17.4%) was obtained for the pair PdOEP/DTACl, concomitantly combining high fluorescence quantum yield of DTACl (ΦF, 70%) and the effective Stern–Volmer quenching constant (KSV, 8.9 × 104 M−1).107 Having considered that much less attention is paid to the development of new triplet acceptors, we synthesized some new 9,10-dinaphthylanthracenes (Fig. 15).108 The results showed that with the same sensitizer such as PdMeTPP, 9,10-dinaphthylanthracene with the donating group exhibits a higher upconversion efficiency than that with the withdrawing group. The results have shown that 9,10-dinaphthylanthracene (DNAMe) showed high fluorescence quantum yield (ΦF, 78%) and larger quenching efficiency (kq, 554.9 M−1 s−1), in comparison with DNACl (ΦF = 69%, kq = 390.0 M−1 s−1) and DNACN (ΦF = 63%, kq = 98.1 M−1 s−1). Consequently, their upconversion efficiencies (ΦUC) were in the order of DNAMe (34.68%) > DNACl (24.57%) > DNACN (21.03%), under excitation at an ultralow power density of 60 mW cm2 (532 nm). Dynamics data showed that the increasing phosphorescence lifetime (τp) accompanied by the decreasing non-phosphorescence decay rate constant (knp) has contribution to the triplet–triplet energy transfer (TTT), confirmed by the Stern–Volmer equation.125

From the point view of the solar energy application, the red-to-blue upconversion was more interesting since such a system can make the best of harvesting sun light over a near infrared range of the solar spectrum. The typical red-to-blue upconversion systems are reported to be PtTPBP doped with perylene and 2CBPEA, respectively (Fig. 16). These systems can produce upconversion at 450–460 nm with respect to the excitation wavelength at 635 nm, showing a larger anti-Stokes shift at 0.73–0.80 eV (Table 1).92,111 Apart from the red-to-blue upconversion system, the red-to-yellow upconversion system was also interesting for solar energy application,112–114 where the systems were mainly fixed on the acceptor of rubrene (5,6,11,12-tetraphenylnaphthacene) doped with different triplet sensitizers. For example, when rubrene was combined with PdPh4TBP and PdPh4MeO8TNP, respectively, the yellow upconverted emission centered at 560 nm was observed in toluene upon excitation at 635 and 695 nm, respectively, which can excite PdPh4TBP and PdPh4MeO8TNP (Fig. 16).100 Also, the yellow upconverted emission from rubrene in toluene was observed with selective excitation of PdTAP at 780 nm and 11,15,18,22,25-octabutoxyphthalocyanine (PdPc(OBu)8) at 725 nm, respectively (Fig. 16).115,116 The above four upconverted systems resulted in a net energy shift between the excitation wavelength and the emitted photons of 0.62 eV for PdTAP/rubrene, 0.26 eV for PdPh4TBP/rubrene, 0.43 eV for PdPh4MeO8TNP/rubrene and 0.50 eV for PdPc(OBu)8/rubrene, respectively.115,116 As for the sensitizer/acceptor pairs of PdPh4TBP/9,10-bis(phenylethnyl)anthracene (BPEA) and PdPh4MeO8TNP/9,10-bis(phenylethynyl)napthacene (BPEN) (Fig. 16), they can produce red-to-green (635 nm shifting 490 nm) and red-to-orange (695 nm shifting to 560 nm) upconversion in toluene, respectively, resulting in the net energy shift of 0.58 and 0.43 eV, respectively.117 Interestingly, in the [Ru(dmb)3]2+/9,10-dimethylanthracene (DMA) system (Fig. 14 and 16), almost equal portions of DMA upconversion and its excimeric emission was presented, which resulted in an overall broad-band white emission.118 It was of critical importance to expand the upconversion blue-shifting to the UV region so as to develop the solar utility of semiconductors (such as TiO2) without dye-sensitization. In 2009, Castellano's group.92reported a new bimolecular system, 2,3-butanedione (biacetyl)/2,5-diphenyloxazole (PPO), that can affect visible-to-UV photon upconversion. With selective 442 nm excitation of the triplet sensitizer of biacetyl, UV upconversion from PPO centered at 360 nm was recorded in deaerated benzene, which presents anti-Stokes shifted by a record 0.64 eV with respect to excitation.
 Fig. 16  Molecular structures of triplet sensitizers and acceptors. 
Up to now, the triplet–triplet annihilated upconversion (TTA-UC) materials only work efficiently in solution with the efficiency at 3–39%; since the TTA-UC is diffusion controlled, the chromophore diffusion in solution can be significantly promoted. Usually, the employed TTA-UC solvents are benzene,90 DMF,92 toluene,90 acetonitrile,118 dichloromethane,119etc. More recently, we systematically investigated both aprotic and protonic solvent-effects on the upconversion efficiency (ΦUC).120 The results showed that the ΦUC of DPA/PdTPP in aprotic solvents decreased with the increase of aprotic solvent polarity; while the ΦUC in protonic solvents increased with the increase of the protonic solvent polarity.120 Importantly, we found that alcohol solvent in the presence of β-cyclodextrin can effectively enhance the phosphorescence lifetime (τP) of the sensitizer (PdTPP) and the fluorescence quantum yield (ΦF) of the acceptor (DPA). In the presence of β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) (Fig. 17), the free rotation of DPA is restricted with the result that both the fluorescence deactivation and the triplet–triplet annihilation of the acceptor (DPA) are enhanced. Thus, an increasing upconversion efficiency (ΦUC) up to ∼36% was obtained under excitation of low power density at 60 mW cm−2 (λex = 532 nm),120 which is a simple way to effectively increase upconversion efficiency without environmental side effects of these volatile and deleterious organic solvents.
 Fig. 17  The proposed mechanism TTA-UC in the presence of β-CD. Reprinted from ref. 120. 
The other simple way to increase upconversion efficiency is the external heavy atom effect.108–110 Under a low-powered excitation of 30 mW cm−2, the upconversion efficiencies (ΦUC) of DPA/PdTPP and DPA/PdBrTPP in the DMF were measured to be 12.33% and 30.18%, respectively. The latter is attributed to the heavy atom effect from the intramolecular effect. For the same system (DPA/PdBrTPP) in PhBr solvent, the measured ΦUC value was as high as 35.17%, indicating that the solvent effect (i.e., the external heavy atom effect) is more efficient than the internal heavy atom effect to increase the upconversion. Due to the fact that TTA-UC shows strong dependence on the triplet state of both the sensitizer and the acceptor, the upconversion efficiency is susceptible to oxygen.121 Nowadays, lots of efforts have been made to achieve TTA-UC in an aerated environment by embedding chromophores in either rubbery or rigid polymeric matrices,2,122 and loading chromophores into silica nanoparticles,123 as well as even incorporating the upconverting dyes in micellar carriers,124 all of these techniques have shown some limitations in either their complicated preparation processes or very low UC-efficiencies (less than 6% at an excitation intensity of 100 mW cm−2). Recently, we found125 that the oil-in-water (o/w) microemulsion containing 9,10-dinaphthylanthracenes doped with Pd(II) tetratolylporphyrin (PdMeTPP) (Fig. 15) exhibits TTA-UC performance without degassing anymore. Under excitation at 60 mW cm−1 power density, the upconverted o/w microemulsion presented an increasing ΦUC value accompanied by an increase in temperature.125 This is attributed to the fact that oil-in-water (o/w) containing the nonionic emulsifier (Tween-20) can be converted reversibly to water-in-oil (w/o) microemulsion (Fig. 18a), which would promote the TTT and TTA processes with a result that the upconverted efficiency is increasing as high as 33.12%. Importantly, the upconveted oil-in-water (o/w) microemulsion remains very stable in air for several days (Fig. 18b).125

3.2 Polymer-based upconversion
Since the solution-based upconverted material is sensitive to oxygen, solid-state upconversion materials are much more attractive, which is convenient for real-world applications without solution toxicity and solvent evaporation. In 2011, Baluschev and Landfester reported the new nanocapsules by encapsulating perylene and PdOEP in polymeric matrixes (Fig. 19a).126 Such nanocapsules show efficient UC emission at 450 nm when dispersed in an aqueous environment and present potential application in the tissue and cells.126 Later, Monguzzi's group successfully obtained PtOEP/DPA-doped polymer nanoparticles (NPs) in aqueous suspension and drop-cast films (Fig. 19b).121 The up-conversion efficiency of the NPs was comparable to that of the corresponding dye solution and the excitation-power threshold (Ith) was as low as a few mW cm−2 (approaching solar irradiance).121 At the same time, Li et al. also prepared the water-soluble upconversion nanoparticles by coloading PtOEP/DPA into silica nanoparticles with the help of surfactants (Fig. 19c).123 These nanoparticles exhibit high upconversion efficiency at 4.5% (260 mW cm−2) in pure water, which have shown low cytotoxicity and successfully used to label living cells with high signal-to-noise ratio.123 Also, Kim et al. obtained the TTA-upconversion (UC) materials achieved in the aqueous phase by encapsulating the solvent phase (hexadecane, HD) containing PtOEP/DPA in a rigid polymer shell (polyisobutylene, PIB) in the form of aqueous dispersible microcapsules (Fig. 19d).20 The green-to-blue upconversion efficiency of the PtOEP/DPA system in HD/PIB was at 10% (at 100 mW cm−2) and 28% (2000 mW cm−2), respectively. These upconverted microcapsules eliminated the need for the deoxygenation step that is essential for existing TTA-based UC processes and enabled stable TTA-UC to occur even after a month of exposure to the ambient environment.

More recently, Castellano and Kim127 developed a kind of colour tunable rigid polymeric microcapsule (MC) that functions both in aqueous and dry phases. Platinum(II) tetraphenyltetrabenzoporphyrin (PtTPBP) was used as a sensitizer and perylene, 9,10-bis(phenylethynyl)anthracene (BPEA), and a boron dipyrromethene derivative (BD-2) were employed as acceptors for red to blue, cyan, and green UC, respectively, in oxygen-rich environments. Combined with the ability to indirectly sensitize a fluorophore using trivial energy transfer, the present soft material design affords colour tuning as well as broadband emission from a monochromatic light source. Facile magnetic separation also allows UC substrate retrieval particularly suitable for bioimaging and related applications in photonics.127
The dyes embedded within the NPs provided the crucial benefit of shielding both the sensitizer and the acceptor from the external environment, preventing quenching by oxygen and suggesting a more-general employment of this material as a dye-protective shell. In 2008, Castellano's group reported the red-to-yellow upconversion from the host EO–EPI doped bimolecular PdPc(OBu)8/rubrene.116 Although rubrene was easy to decompose over several days under ambient aerated conditions, the intensity of yellow upconverted fluorescence was shown to slowly decrease in this solid system over this time period, demonstrating that the decomposition of rubrene can be effectively depressed in host EO–EPI matrixes, as was evident by the disappearance of the absorption bands of rubrene.116 All of these solid TTA-UC materials were confirmed to maintain stable upconversion emission for several months since the degassed solution containing the sensitizer/acceptor pairs was blended in films under the condition of a nitrogen or argon atmosphere. However, these solid-based upconversion efficiencies were quite low (less than 6% at an excitation intensity of 100 mW cm−2), with respect to the counterpart in liquid solution. For example, using cellulose acetate as the inert host matrix doped with palladium(II) tetraphenyltetrabenzoporphyrin (PdTPBP)/9,10-bis(phenylethylnyl)anthracene (BPEA), the red-to-green photon upconversion at 515 nm originating from BPEA was observed when selective excitation of PdTPBP at 633 nm, however, the upconverted efficiency was three orders of magnitude lower in the solid film than in liquid solution.128 This indicates that the polymer matrix reduces the triplet exciton mobility and the diffusion coefficient to result in decreasing TTA-upconversion. As predicted by the Stokes–Einstein relationship, the molecular diffusion coefficient (D) is directly proportional to the temperature (T) and inversely proportional to the viscosity (η) of the medium, shown in eqn (17).129 (17)
Here, k is Boltzmann's constant. R is the radius of the spherical particle. Since small sized molecules are easy to diffuse, the sensitizer and acceptor should be small; meanwhile, the increased temperature and decreased viscosity (η) of the medium also promote diffusion, all of which would result in enhanced TTA-UC. For polymer-based materials, as the temperature of the film is increased, the polymer viscosity is reduced; these cooperative effects promote faster diffusion and more efficient energy transfer collisions with improved upconversion yields at elevated temperatures, probably due to the varied distance in the polymeric matrix.130
To exploit efficient solid upconverted materials, several rubbery polyurethanes are selected as solid matrices, such as copolymer ethyleneoxide/epichlorohydrin (EO–EPI, Fig. 20a),116,131 cellulose acetate, rigid poly(methylmethacrylate) (PMMA),132 polyurethane precursors (Clear Flex 50, CLRFLX, Fig. 20b),133 and even a multicomponent polymeric film.128 For example, Castellano's group used a copolymer of ethyleneoxide and epichlorohydrin (EO–EPI) as the host matrix doped with the bimolecular PdOEP/DPA.131 They found that TTA-upconversion efficiency was much lower in comparison with that in solution. This strongly suggests that the enhancing mobility of PdOEP and DPA in the polymeric matrix is much more essential, since the chromophore diffusion is inhibited in the glassy state.131 When PtOEP/DPA was doped in rigid poly(methylmethacrylate) (PMMA) films, the obtained blue DPA upconversion efficiency was at 0.02%; however, within the rigid PMMA films doped with 2MeOTX, the blue DPA upconversion efficiency was enhanced. Also within the rigid PMMA films doped with 2MeOTX/PPO (2-methoxythioxanthone/2,5-diphenyloxazole), blue-to-UV photon upconversion was reported when selective excitation of 2MeOTX at 410 nm resulted in upconverted PPO emission in the region 350–380 nm.132 It was found that increasing doping concentrations of the emitter can facilitate the migration of triplet energy in the polymer host. Meanwhile increasing temperature could decrease the viscosity/rigidity of the polymer and would improve the doped chromophore diffusion, which would significantly promote the polymer-based upconversion efficiency.

4. Conclusions and outlook
So as to provide a comprehensive overview for investigators who are interesting in organic molecular photon up-conversion, we reviewed the two-photon absorption upconversion (TPA-UC) and triplet–triplet annihilation upconversion (TTA-UC) collectively, each of which has been actively investigated in recent years. Although TPA-UC and TTA-UC are all based on organic molecules, both are very different, such as in mechanism, characteristics and techniques involved. The distinguishing features between TPA-UC and TTA-UC are presented in Table 2.

In seeking for the active TPA-UC and TTA-UC chromophores, physical scientists, chemists and material scientists are required to play the critical roles in the investigation of materials and photophysical rules, because the design of new and efficient chromophores is dependent on molecular engineering and optical operation. Recent TPA upconversion advance134 shows that the metal–organic framework materials can effectively boost their multiphoton absorption cross-sections and enhanced upconversion efficiency based on Förster resonance energy transfer. Within host–guest metal–organic frameworks consisting of encapsulated high quantum yielding guest molecules, the multi-photon upconversion can be effectively enhanced at 800, 1200, and 1500 nm femtosecond pulsed laser excitation.134 The multi-photon upconversion is much more beneficial owing to the cubic or biquadratic dependence of the input light intensity and the use of a much longer excitation wavelength. Also, multi-photon excitation would present better spatial confinement of the excitation volume and thus higher resolution. Furthermore, the multi-photon lasing can result in the largest anti-Stokes emission so far.12 An other recent progress135 in developing TPA materials showed that an organic single crystal of an oligo(phenylene vinylene) can exhibit strong two-photon excited fluorescence and stimulated emission, with large TPA cross sections spanning a wide wavelength range at 700–800 nm. The measured TPA cross-section is exceptionally large (3137 GM). Because of the very large TPA cross-sections, two-photon-excited fluorescence in either solution and in solid form can be unambiguously recorded even on a standard spectrofluorimeter with a Xenon lamp as the excitation source,135 showing potential TPA-UC applications in the fields of biophotonics and optics.
As for TTA-UC molecule engineering, sensitizers with intense absorption of visible light in the red and near-IR range, accompanied by long triplet lifetime (τP) is aspired. Meanwhile developing acceptors with high fluorescence quantum yield (ΦF) is also important. Moreover, the energy levels between the sensitizer and acceptor should be matched, that is, ET1(D) > ET1(A) and 2ET1(A) > ES1(A) > ES1(D) (i.e., the excited triplet state of the sensitizer (ET1(D)) is higher in energy than the triplet state of the acceptor (ET1(A)), the singlet excited state of the acceptor (ES1(A)) should be higher in energy than that of the singlet excited state of the sensitizer (ES1(D)) and lower than two times the triplet state energy of the acceptor itself).136 Recent TTA upconversion advance137–139 reveals that developing the sensitizers with a high triplet energy level (ET) and the acceptors with a small singlet–triplet difference (ΔEST) is beneficial to triplet–triplet energy transfer efficiency (ΦTTT) and especially to promoting triplet–triplet annihilation (ΦTTA).137–139 In addition, considering that the spin multiplicities of the other 5/9 and 3/9 of spin multiplicities can also be annihilated via the singlet pathway.140 How to use these the spin multiplicities is worth the whistle.
Finally, it should be pointed out that the key to increase the upconversion efficiency is to enhance the intramolecular charge-transfer for TPA-UC and the intermolecular energy-transfer for TTA-UC. Probably, in the framework of the host–guest super-molecular system, the combination of the Förster energy-transfer for TPA-UC and Dexter electron-transfer for TTA-UC is a new strategy of molecule engineering. The investigation of the relationship between TPA-UC and TTA-UC is challenging and especially worth pursuing.
