    , Accepted 17th February 2022First published on 18th February 2022AbstractRecent research on piezoelectrically driven self-charging supercapacitor power cells (SCSPCs) aims to increase their self-charging performance and understand the charge storage/delivery mechanism. Here, we fabricated a novel SCSPC using a Nafion solid polyelectrolyte separator coated with graphene sheets as supercapacitor electrodes, which exhibited a self-charging process due to the piezo-ionic (PI) effect. The graphene PI-SCSPC can self-charge up to 341 mV under a mechanical stimulus that is superior to many of the reported SCSPCs. The self-charging process is explained based on the creation of the Donnan potential and Nernst's theory of the 2D system. Electrochemical gating coupled with mechanical stimulation was used for understanding the charging dynamics of the graphene PI-SCSPC via examining the critical role of (i) electrochemical doping, and variation in the (ii) voltage of the charge-neutrality point, and (iii) current amplitudes. These findings open a new paradigm for developing novel SCSPCs and understanding their charging dynamics that is of great interest for the realization of next-generation integrated energy cells.
1. Introduction
Integrated energy cells (IECs) are conceptual devices developed via implementing energy harvesting principles/technology in an energy storage device/system for applications in wearable or portable electronics.1 In essence, energy harvesting, and storage are different aspects of an energy system that works independently based on standalone principles. Energy harvesting devices require a storage device to store the generated charges for sustainable power delivery, whereas an energy storage device needs a power source to charge it.2 Considering the rapid increase in global demands towards the growth of portable and wearable electronic devices, integrated energy cells have become a prime area in energy research since they can be autonomously charged themselves.3 Recently, a variety of IECs designed via incorporation of energy harvesting principles (piezoelectric/triboelectric nanogenerators, solar/optoelectronics, and the oxygen reduction reaction) in energy storage solutions (such as batteries and supercapacitors (SCs)) was reported.4–7 Due to the device structure and configuration, IECs can simultaneously harvest and store electrical energy that can be used whenever required.8 IECs possess high merits compared to an extrinsically integrated system due to low manufacturing cost and the elimination of complex power management circuits, wired or wireless circuitry, and packaging costs.9 Furthermore, the synchronous energy harvesting-, and storage process in IECs led to exploring a new paradigm in energy science and technology distinct from the established ones.
Self-charging supercapacitor power cells (SCSPCs) are one of the emerging IECs that are capable of contemporaneous harvesting (mechanical energy) and storage of energy (electrical) in a single cell.10 The core idea of SCSPCs is based on the utilization of a piezoelectric separator instead of a conventional polymer separator in an SC cell.11 These devices can be charged via mechanical stimulation (due to the piezoelectric effect of the separator) even at places where no electric power supply is available; thus, they have high potential applicability in wearable energy solutions for health care monitoring devices (smartwatches). The energy transduction and charge storage process was explained based on the “piezo-electrochemical” process that occurred inside the cell and the Nernstian potential of SC electrodes.12 After the experimental findings on a self-charging power cell (SCPC) via incorporation of piezoelectric concepts in a Li-ion battery cell, research on SCSPCs was initiated during 2013, and extensive efforts have been undertaken till now.12,13 The fast charging and long life of SCs with ease of integration into wearables or textiles, utilization of relatively non-toxic gel polymer electrolytes used in SC, and the complexity of developing wearable batteries make them ideal candidates for next-generation IECs.14,15 To date, SCSPCs fabricated using various electrode materials with different types of charge-storage mechanisms such as EDLC (graphene and carbon), pseudocapacitive (MnO2), and battery type electrodes with piezo-polymer separators have been reported.16–19 The exciting part of the construction of SCSPCs is piezo-polymer separators (PVDF and their co-polymers). Various morphologies and porosities of these separators are prepared via solvent casting and electrospinning.20 Instead, bio-piezoelectric separators are also utilized as novel separators in SCSPCs.19 Additionally, piezo-ceramics (BaTiO3 and KNN) incorporated conventional PVA-based gel electrolytes were recently used by D. Zhou et al. to utilize the piezo-properties of piezo-ceramics instead of piezo-polymers.21–23 More recently, we have demonstrated the use of solid electrolyte incorporated PVDF as a novel bifunctional separator (piezoelectric energy harvesting and supply of ions) for SCSPCs.24 The fabrication of SCSPCs using different electrode materials and separators was mainly focused on improving the self-charging performance metrics, i.e., the self-charging voltage maximum (Vmax). The low energy conversion efficiency (self-charging performance metrics), limitations in theoretical models, and experimental tools to understand the energy conversion and storage mechanism are considered major issues in ongoing SCSPC research and development.25 Therefore, developing either theoretical and experimental approaches or a new SCSPC system to improve their performances is of prime interest considering their state of the art devices.
Taking these prime factors into account, we have considered the use of solid electrolytes in SCSPCs with special interest owing to their non-fluidic nature with minimal self-discharge properties (compared to aqueous and gel electrolytes).26,27 In this regard, it is worth mentioning that a Nafion polyelectrolyte composed of sulfonated tetrafluoroethylene-based fluoropolymer-copolymer is preferred due to its ionic conductivity and mechanical properties.28,29 Nafion polyelectrolyte is widely used in electrochemical energy devices as separators, electrolytes, and binders.30,31 Furthermore, recent studies demonstrated the mechano/piezo ionic properties of Nafion (especially in the form of ionic polymer metal composites (IPMCs)) towards applications in energy harvesting, actuators, sensors, etc.32–34 Considering the current issues in SCSPCs, we have designed a new type of SCSPC via utilizing the mechano/piezo ionic properties of Nafion, which acts as a dual functional separator capable of energy generation as well as proton supply for charge storage. The working mechanism of the polyelectrolyte-based SCSPC is explained based on the mechano/piezo ionic transduction of protons that is significantly different from the reported SCSPCs in which piezoelectrically triggered electrolyte ion movement occurs. More importantly, the mechanism of mechano/piezo ionic driven self-charging properties of the fabricated polyelectrolyte based SCSPC is explored using electrochemical gating combined with straintronics/ionotronics.
2. Results and discussion

Fig. 1(A) shows the current trends in the development of piezoelectrically driven SCSPCs, in which two types of piezo-separators have been used to date. The first type involves using piezoelectric polymers such as PVDF and their co-polymers or bio-piezoelectric polymers as separators in SCSPCs.35 In contrast, the second type involves using piezoelectric ceramic material (BaTiO3 and KNN) incorporated PVA-based gel polymer electrolytes.21,23 In these reported studies, SCSPCs are operated based on the piezoelectrically mediated electrochemical energy transfer reaction as explained based on piezo-electrochemistry principles.8,13 The current work aims to utilize the piezo-ionic properties of Nafion polyelectrolyte (Nafion) as a separator cum ion source for application in SCSPCs. The structure of a Nafion polyelectrolyte film (Fig. 1(A), right side) typically comprises chains of hydrophobic (tetrafluoroethylene) and hydrophilic (perfluorinated vinyl ether co-monomer) groups with the presence of ionomeric cavities for the transportation of protons.28,36 Fig. S1, ESI† shows the surface morphology and elemental analysis of the Nafion film, which indicates the presence of smooth surfaces (Fig. S1(A) and (B), ESI†) with a uniform distribution of elements such as carbon, oxygen, fluorine, and sulfur throughout the film (Fig. S1(C)–(G), ESI†). The EDX spectrum and elemental composition analysis (Fig. S1(H), ESI†) show that the C:O:F:S elements are present in a ratio of 23.06:11.97:62.00:2.97 in the Nafion film. The 2D topographic image (Fig. S2(A), ESI†) of the Nafion film was measured over an area of 2 × 2 μm2 using an atomic force microscope (AFM), which indicated the presence of a nanoscale void-like region throughout the scanned region. The AFM phase image of the Nafion film (Fig. S2(B), ESI†) depicts the presence of hydrophilic sulphonic acid groups (pink colored) separated from the hydrophobic tetrafluoroethylene backbone. These observed structures are in close agreement with Gierke's cluster model of a Nafion membrane comprised of the hydrophilic domain (containing the proton) surrounded by the hydrophobic zone.37,38 It is worth mentioning that the main prerequisites of a separator in SCSPCs are their ability to harvest energy upon mechanical stimulation and provide an electrolyte ion source for charge storage at the SC electrode. Therefore, we first examined the energy harvesting properties of the Nafion polyelectrolyte film (with gold coating on either side) via monitoring their voltage profiles under an external mechanical stimulus. The results are summarized in Fig. 1(B)–(G). The Nafion polyelectrolyte film generated a peak-to-peak voltage of 460 mV when subjected to mechanical stimuli using a linear motor with an acceleration of 1 m s−2. The mechanism of energy harvesting in the Nafion polyelectrolyte film can be explained based on the proton movement towards the elongated and compressed region as the mechanical stimuli are applied and released. The piezo-ionic triggered proton movement across the opposite region of the film results in voltage generation or Donnan potential.39,40 The electrical outputs of the Nafion polyelectrolyte film are linearly increased with an increase in the applied acceleration levels (Fig. 1(B)–(F)). From Fig. 1(G), it is evident that the voltage outputs of the Nafion polyelectrolyte film are increased from 460 mV to 1000 mV when the acceleration ranges are increased from 1 to 10 m s−2. Fig. S3, ESI† shows that the electrical outputs of the Nafion polyelectrolyte film are almost constant (without any noticeable changes) over 1000 seconds, ensuring their excellent electro-mechanical stability. These studies indicate the Nafion polyelectrolyte film's candidature as a piezo-ionic separator in SCSPCs.

Next, we developed PI-SCSPC using a Nafion polyelectrolyte film as the dual functional separator with two ideal graphene sheets (prepared via thermal annealing of GO) as SC electrodes. Fig. 2 summarizes the physico-chemical characterization of the prepared graphene sheets. The comparative X-ray diffraction pattern of GO and graphene sheets (Fig. 2(A)) showed that the major diffraction peak shifted from 10.92° (001 plane of GO) to 23.84° (002 plane of graphene) confirming better thermal reduction of GO into graphene sheets.41 Functional groups such as C–O (1081 cm−1), C–O–C (1228 cm−1), C–OH (1407 cm−1), C–C or –OH resonance (1624 cm−1), and CO (1730 cm−1) in GO sheets as seen from FT-IR spectra (Fig. 2(B)) almost diminished or disappeared after the thermal reduction process.16 The FT-IR spectrum of graphene sheets (Fig. 2(B)) shows only the presence of C–C vibrations at 1570 cm−1 with the co-existence of C–O–C groups at 1218 cm−1 that further confirms the deoxygenation of GO during the thermal treatment process.16 Typical X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) of GO and graphene sheets are provided in Fig. S4, ESI† which suggest that graphene possesses a lower oxygen content than GO because of the thermal decomposition of oxygenated functional groups in GO. The C 1s core-level spectrum of GO (Fig. S5, ESI†) indicated the presence of bands related to C–C, CO, C–O–C and C–O groups in which only the C–C groups with lower amount of C–O–C groups were retained in graphene sheets (Fig. 2(C)) after the thermal reduction process.42 The HR-TEM micrographs of graphene sheets given in Fig. 2(D)–(F) indicated the presence of sheet-like structures with crumpled wavy-natured surfaces. The presence of carbon and oxygen elements in the prepared graphene sheets is evidenced from the elemental maps given in Fig. 2(G) and (H). The presence of oxygen in graphene sheets is due to the residual oxygen groups (C–O–C) preserved in the graphene sheets even after the thermal treatment process.42Fig. 2(I) shows the 2D Raman maps of the graphene sheets, which indicate the presence of D and G bands at 1350 cm−1 and 1575 cm−1, respectively.43 The G band in graphene sheets is shifted towards a lower wavenumber compared to GO sheets given in Fig. S6, ESI,† suggesting that the re-graphitization process occurred during the thermal treatment process. Fig. 2(J) and (K) presents the peak position map of the D and G bands, which indicates that they lie in the region from 1342 to 1352 cm−1, and 1575 to 1579 cm−1, respectively. The peak position of the G band is closer to that of graphite, substantiating the better re-graphitization process that occurred after the thermal reduction of GO sheets.24 The peak position map of the 2 D band (Fig. 2(L)) shows that it lies in the region from 2680 to 2700 cm−1 which is in close agreement with the previous studies on reduced graphene oxide sheets.44 Furthermore, the ID/IG ratio map (Fig. 2(M)) is almost constant being about 0.85 over the entire mapped region which revealed the occurrence of a uniform reduction process.45

Furthermore, the electrochemical charge-storage properties of the fabricated graphene PI-SCSPC are accessed by standard performance analysis methods such as CV, CD and EIS techniques, respectively.46 The CV profiles of graphene PI-SCSPC (Fig. 3(A)) recorded over a voltage window from 0.0 to 0.8 V show the presence of rectangular-shaped curves as an indication of electric double-layer capacitance (EDLC).47 The charge-storage and delivery kinetics in graphene PI-SCSPC is due to the adsorption/desorption of protons at the graphene electrodes during the charging and discharging process.16 There was no observation of any redox peaks in the CV profiles suggesting the absence of any faradaic mediated process in the charge-storage process of graphene PI-SCSPC.48 The scan rate from 5 to 100 mV s−1 increases the current ranges in the CV profiles (Fig. 3(A)) and decreases the device capacitance from 101.86 to 41.86 μF cm−2 (Fig. 3(B)). Fig. 3(C) shows the CD profiles of graphene PI-SCSPC measured using different applied currents from 5 to 100 μA, which show a quasi-symmetric triangular-shaped profile indicating EDLC characteristics.49 Graphene PI-SCSPC possess a high areal capacitance of 245.02 μF cm−2 from the CD profile recorded using 5 μA (Fig. 3(D)). It is worth mentioning that the capacitance of graphene PI-SCSPC is lower than that of graphene based SCs using aqueous and gel electrolytes.50,51 Being a solid-state single ion conductor, Nafion requires high energy for the movement of protons in the air compared to aqueous or gel-type electrodes.51 The Nyquist plot (Fig. 3(E)) recorded at different applied voltages shows there are no observation of any charge-transfer resistances (usually observed as a semi-circle-like arc), and only the Warburg line is observed because of proton diffusion at the graphene electrodes.52 The Warburg line runs almost parallel to the imaginary component of the impedance for all applied voltages. In contrast, it deviates for 0.8 V due to the parasitic reactions at these voltages. It agrees with the Bode phase angle plots (Fig. 3(F)), which depict that the phase angle is in the range from −65 to −70° (except for 0.8 V) for graphene PI-SCSPC as an indication of an ideal capacitive nature.46Fig. 3(G) shows the superior rate capability of graphene PI-SCSPC with better capacitance retention examined via continuous ramping cycles of different applied currents from low to high and vice versa. Fig. S7, ESI† reveals the excellent electrochemical stability of graphene PI-SCSPC with an excellent capacitance retention of 97.82%.53Fig. 3(H) shows the self-discharge analysis of graphene PI-SCSPC monitored for over 22000 seconds after charging at 0.8 V over 10 minutes. It showed the initial drop in the voltage up to 0.7 V due to the ESR of graphene PI-SCSPC followed by linear self-discharging characteristics with an increase in time.54 Fig. S8, ESI† and its associated discussion summarize that the self-discharge is due to ohmic leakage and a diffusion mediated charge-redistribution process, not overcharging issues.54,55Fig. 3(I) shows the Ragone plot of graphene PI-SCSPC demonstrating a high energy density of 21.78 μW h cm−2 at a power density of 0.888 μW cm−2 from the CD profile recorded using 5 μA current. Furthermore, the device retains an energy density of 6.27 μW h cm−2 when it reaches its maximal power density of 17.77 μW cm−2. Fig. 3(I) and Table S1, ESI† summarize a superior energy density of 21.78 μW h cm−2 of graphene PI-SCSPC compared to that of (i) graphene flexible SCs, (ii) silica carbide nanowire-based SCs, (iii) titanium carbide based SCs, (iv) hybrid electrode-based SCs, (v) carbyne-enriched-carbon based SC, and so on. These studies substantiate the energy storage performances of graphene PI-SCSPC.

Next, we have examined the self-charging properties of graphene PI-SCSPC when subjected to external mechanical stimuli, as summarized in Fig. 4. Here, the external mechanical stimuli were applied to graphene PI-SCSPC using a linear motor under different acceleration ranges. Fig. 4(A) shows the self-charging performance of graphene PI-SCSPC which reveals that they could charge from 33 to 149 mV within 300 seconds using an acceleration of 5 m s−2 followed by a discharging process using a constant current of 5 μA. With an increase in acceleration ranges such as 7.5 and 10 m s−2, graphene PI-SCSPC can be self-charged from 39 to 251 mV and 42 to 383 mV, as seen from Fig. 4(B) and (C), respectively. Fig. 4(D) compares the performances of graphene PI-SCSPC, which reveals that they could be self-charged up to 116, 212, and 339 mV (within 300 s) using accelerations of 5, 7.5, and 10 m s−2, respectively. The self-charging voltage ranges of graphene PI-SCSPC are comparable to and even better than many of the piezoelectric-based SCSPCs reported to date. For instance, Table S2, ESI† shows that the self-charging voltage of 339 mV obtained for graphene PI-SCSPC is higher than that of reported piezoelectric polymer separator based SCSPCs such as (i) MnO2 SCSPC (110 mV),18 (ii) functionalized carbon cloth SCSPC (100 mV),17 (iii) CNT SCSPC (70 mV),56 and (iv) asymmetric supercapacitor-based SCSPC (151 mV)19 and piezoceramic based SCSPCs such as (i) graphene SEBS SSCs (100 mV),21 (ii) NiCo2O4@activated carbon cloth SSCs (250 mV),22 and (iii) Co–Fe2O3@ activated carbon cloth SSCs(120 mV),23 respectively. The continuous self-charging characteristics of graphene PI-SCSPC (subjected to a 7.5 m s−2, acceleration) over six cycles is presented in Fig. 4(E), which indicate that their outputs are almost similar (130 ± 5 mV). Fig. S9, ESI† shows 15 consecutive cycles of the self-charging process of graphene PI-SCSPC (with 10 m s−2 acceleration) which indicated that the self-charging voltages are almost constant (335 ± 10 mV). These studies validated their repeatable energy conversion and storage process. Furthermore the energy storage capability of graphene PI-SCSPC after the self-charging process is also studied using self-discharge characteristics as shown in Fig. 4(F). After reaching a voltage of 341 mV via the self-charging process, the self-discharge profiles of graphene PI-SCSPC were monitored over 20000 seconds to reach a voltage of 40 mV. It showed that the self-discharge rate is higher at the initial stage (up to 5000 seconds) and lower with an increase in time that is due to the proton diffusion mediated self-discharge process.46Fig. 5 shows the stage-wise mechanism involved in the self-charging properties of graphene PI-SCSPC governed via the piezo-ionic driven piezo-electrochemical process. Fig. 5(A) shows that the device is under an equilibrium condition in which the freely movable protons are ionically bonded to the fixed sulfate groups present in the Nafion polyelectrolyte film. Fig. 5(B) shows the state of graphene PI-SCSPC when subjected to an external mechanical stimulus that triggers the proton to move towards the elongated region where the graphene SC electrode is present. These movable protons form an electric double layer (EDL) at the surface of the graphene sheets, i.e., the generation of Donnan potential via the piezo-ionic or mechano-ionic effect.57,58 At this stage, the adsorption of protons at the graphene surface will result in the creation of a net potential difference between the symmetric graphene electrodes in the PI-SCSPC, that results in the self-charging process. Fig. 5(C) shows the state of graphene PI-SCSPC when the applied external mechanical stimulus is released. In this process, the protons move towards the graphene electrode in the compressed region of the Nafion polyelectrolyte film. It is worth mentioning that the proton movement in graphene PI-SCSPC occurs via the tunneling effect between the SO3− groups inside the ionomeric cavity of the Nafion polyelectrolyte film.59 Furthermore, the energy required for proton tunneling in Nafion polyelectrolyte films is higher than that for the proton movement in an aqueous or gel polymer electrolyte; that is why the self-charging rate of graphene PI-SCSPC is lower compared to the state of the art devices.8,16 The observed self-charging rate in graphene PI-SCSPC is comparable to that of graphene SCSPC utilizing a PTA-PVDF piezo-electrolyte film.24 Once the applied external mechanical stimulus is completely removed, the graphene PI-SCSPC comes to an equilibrium state almost closer to that of the initial stage (Fig. 5(D)). This is the self-charging mechanism after one complete cycle, and this process continues when the external mechanical stimulus is applied to the graphene PI-SCSPC again. The overall process can be described by using the relation between the electrode potential and ion concentration gradient in a 2D system using the Nernst equation60 as follows:

(B) presents stage 2, in which an external mechanical stimulus is applied to the surface of the graphene PI-SCSPC that triggers the protons to move towards the tensile region. (C) presents stage 3 after removing the external mechanical stimulus onto the surface of the graphene PI-SCSPC that results in the movement of protons towards the graphene electrode in the compressed region. (D) depicts stage 4 in which the force is completely removed, leading to the equilibrium position in which protons move towards the SO3− groups present in the ionomeric cavity of the Nafion polyelectrolyte film.

Here, “E(graphene)” and “” refer to the actual and standard electrode potential of graphene electrodes in the PI-SCSPC. The terms “R,” “T,” and “F” refer to the gas constant, temperature, and Faraday constant, respectively. The terms “X” and “X°” represent the proton occupancy fraction at the surface of graphene electrodes under normal conditions and that when subjected to applied mechanical force.61 The terms “P” and “P°” denote the intercalation pressure of 2D graphene sheets under normal conditions and that when subjected to applied mechanical force. When subjected to an external mechanical stimulus, the freely movable protons move to the surface of graphene electrodes in the compressed region of the graphene PI-SCSPC, resulting in an increased proton occupancy (X°) compared to that of the normal state. The higher proton occupancy (X° > X) results in the generation of a net potential difference between the graphene electrodes,8,61 thus leading to an overall self-charging process (Fig. 5) governed via the piezo-ionic effect.
The mechano-electrochemical process and vice versa play a critical role in the energy transfer process involved in multi-component energy systems such as SCSPCs, actuators, and electrochemically driven mechanical energy harvesting devices.8,62,63 However, understanding the mechanism of the energy transfer process in these devices is currently difficult due to the lack of sophisticated instrumentation for the direct measurement of the in situ reactions involved in those systems. Recently, electrochemical gating technology has been widely applied to understand the energy transfer process in electrochemical energy conversion and storage devices.64,65 For instance, Y. He et al. demonstrated the self-gating effect in semiconductor nanocrystals in electrocatalytic hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions.66 Very recently, electrochemical gating has been used to understand the conductivity of layered graphene sheets during the charging and discharging process in supercapacitors.67 Herein, we have utilized the electrochemical gating technique coupled with mechanical deformation for elucidating the piezo-ionic mediated energy transfer and charge storage in the graphene PI-SCSPC. Fig. 6(A) shows the electrochemical gating used in the graphene PI-SCSPC. The top graphene electrode in the SCSPC serves as the channel (source-drain), and the Nafion polyelectrolyte film separates the gate electrode (bottom). The current–voltage characteristics of the graphene channel concerning various gate voltages are provided in Fig. 6(B). It showed the linear dependency of IDS according to the VDS for the applied gate voltages (either negative or positive), which indicated a better contact between the individual graphene sheets in the top electrode. However, in comparison with conventional graphene FETs which showed the linear I–V behavior, these devices showed the presence of space-charge limited current (SCLC) conduction which might have arisen from the Nafion polyelectrolyte. Unlike other ion gatings reported in the literature, the Nafion polyelectrolyte being used as a solid-state single ion conductor works on the principle of proton tunneling in air that results in the accumulation of space charge in the ionomeric cavities of the membrane.59,68 This is the origin of such SCLC mediated conduction pathways in the IDS–VDS characteristics shown in Fig. 6(B).

(H) Proton movement in the Nafion film present in graphene PI-SCSPC under the flat state, upward, and downward bending conditions. 
To understand the piezo-ionic mediated self-charging process involved in the PI-SCSPC, the transfer curves of the graphene PI-SCSPC were studied in detail under different conditions. Herein, two key metrics, such as (i) change in the voltage of the charge-neutrality point (VCNP) and (ii) change in the amplitude of current, were used to understand the overall charge-transfer process.69 The transfer curves (IDSvs. VGS) of the fabricated SCSPC recorded at constant VDS = 0 V under different mechanical states of the device such as flat, tensile and compression are shown in Fig. 6(C). It showed that the charge-neutrality point is observed at VCNP = −1.9 V when the device is under flat conditions. Under bent states, the VCNP is not changed when the device is bent upward, whereas the VCNP moves from −179 mV into −110 mV (69 mV) when bent downward. This observation is also verified with similar transfer characteristics recorded with a constant VDS of ± 50 mV and ± 100 mV, as shown in Fig. 6(D)–(G). It showed that no or minimal change in VCNP was observed under upward bending conditions, whereas significant change was noticed in VCNP during downward bending. The observation of minimal change in VCNP during upward bending is due to the formation of the depletion region because of the unavailability of freely movable anions in Nafion. The VCNP of the graphene SCSPC device under downward bending conditions shows that they move towards a positive voltage with a shift voltage of 49 mV (from −199 to −150 mV), 78 mV (from −148 to −70 mV), 31 mV (from −220 to −189 mV), and 90 mV (from −119 to −29 mV) when the VDS is −50, +50, −100, and +100 mV, respectively. Fig. 6(H) shows the mechanism of proton movement and Fig. S10, ESI† presents the corresponding potential distribution diagram of the graphene PI-SCSPC during the applied mechanical stimulus. During upward bending, the cations or protons move towards the graphene channel (top electrode), which eventually induces negative charge carriers at the graphene channel and results in the formation of an EDL due to the n-doping effect.40 However, upon downward bending, the cations or protons move towards the surface of the graphene gate (bottom electrode), leading to the formation of a cationic depletion region at the graphene channel that results in the p-doping effect.40 The observed shift in VCNP with an increase in VDS from 0 to ±100 mV is due to the amplified piezo-ionic effect. The presence of an external field accelerates the proton tunneling process in Nafion towards the graphene gate and channel based on the polarity. These studies confirm the presence of piezo-ionic properties in the Nafion solid electrolyte that can be transported towards the graphene electrodes via mechanical stimulation, which is a promising finding for the self-charging process in the graphene PI-SCSPC using Nafion. Furthermore, the current magnitude is higher for the graphene channel under upward bending and vice versa. This can be explained because of the electric double layer formation at the graphene and Nafion interface due to the movement of protons towards the graphene channel during upward bending.70 The protons move towards the gate electrode when the bending direction is reversed, making the graphene channel more positive. These results validate the formation of negative and positive type graphene surfaces upon mechanical stimuli (upward and downward bending surfaces) because of proton movement between the two graphene electrodes, which is the cause of the self-charging process involved in the graphene PI-SCSPC due to piezo-ionic effect.
3. Conclusions
The prominent findings of this study demonstrated the use of a solid proton-conducting polyelectrolyte (Nafion) film as a dual functional (piezo-ionic and ion supply) separator for self-charging supercapacitor power cells utilizing graphene sheets as the electrodes. The energy storage properties of graphene PI-SCSPC utilizing a Nafion solid polyelectrolyte film as novel functional separators were studied in detail. The graphene PI-SCSPC can be self-charged up to 341 mV when subjected to an external mechanical stimulus comparable to and better than that of the reported SCSPCs made of piezo-polymer and piezo-ceramic based separators. The self-charging mechanism was explained based on the “piezo-ionic effect driven piezoelectrochemical process” via the generation of Donnan potential and Nernst theory for 2D systems. Furthermore, experimental studies via decoupling the mechano- and electrochemical gating confirmed the role of the piezo-ionic effect on the overall self-charging process involved in the graphene PI-SCSPC. Our studies collectively demonstrated a new type of SCSPC governed via the piezo-ionic (instead of piezoelectric) effect and used electrochemical gating technology coupled with ionotronics for the elucidation of the self-charging mechanism, which will be beneficial to explore the charge-storage mechanism in multifunctional supercapacitors or IECs.
