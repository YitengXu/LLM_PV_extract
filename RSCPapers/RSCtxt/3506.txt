Currently available OMMs at optical wavelengths are all composed of periodic structures, and fabricated by top-down approaches of e-beam lithography or focused ion beam technique.

1. Introduction
Left-handed metamaterials (LHMs)1–5 have recently been focused on by both scientific and engineering communities. Possessing simultaneously negative dielectric permittivity ε and magnetic permeability μ, LHMs exhibit unique electromagnetic properties compared with normal, right-handed materials while still obeying the Maxwell equation and not violating known physical laws.6 Recently, LHMs at optical frequencies have been developed as a research focus in this subject.7–10 In 2005, negative μ was realized at telecommunication (200THz) and visible (370THz) frequencies with arrays of “U”-shaped Au nanostructures.11 In 2006, a LHM at a visible frequency of 780nm was fabricated with a novel fishnet design.12 This type of LHM was composed of two layers of silver fishnet structure which were separated by a dielectric spacer. In 2008, multi-layers of “U”-shaped arrays were studied, which obtained negative ε and μ around 120 and 200 THz, respectively.13 A three dimensional optical metamaterial was fabricated with multi-layers of fishnet structures, and the negative refraction was firstly demonstrated in this frequency band.14 However, the fabrication of LHMs at optical frequencies consistently used the “top-down” approaches of e-beam lithography or focused ion beam technique.7,15–17 This approach often requires costly delicate instruments to conduct complicated processes, but producing prepared samples with effective areas only on the square micrometer scale. Especially, with a “top-down” approach, the nanostructuring techniques are usually applied to planar structures. For many novel applications, however, structuring matter on rough hard or flexible substrates is often a prerequisite to observe certain magnification effects. The above mentioned shortcomings extremely restricted the development of LHMs at optical frequencies. Recently, the bottom-up fabrication of optical LHMs has attracted much attention. A two-dimensional square array of gold nanoparticle clusters was fabricated by using template-directed colloidal self-assembly, which shows strong extinction peaks in the near-infrared region owing to the electric resonance.18 A negative index metamaterial based on metal-dielectric nanocomposites was demonstrated using a versatile bottom-up nanofabrication approach.19 A periodic large-area metallic SRR metamaterial based on shadow nanosphere lithography was fabricated,20 and metamaterials with selectable and controllable negative permittivity were prepared in unstructured carbon nanofibers polymer composites.21 A scalable cylindrical metallodielectric metamaterial was fabricated with layer-by-layer deposition designed.22 In this review, we mainly introduce the progress of our group on the bottom-up fabrication technique of optical metamaterials (OMMs), showing the performance of devices capable of operating in optical media.
2. Dendritic model for left-handed metamaterials
Veselago1 proposed the initial suggestion of LHMs, followed by the pioneering work of Pendry.23,24 Smith and co-workers2,25–28 presented evidence for a composite medium displaying negative values of ε and μ at gigahertz frequencies. Though various design were proposed aiming to make the structure simpler or more isotropic and appropriate for two-dimensional and three-dimensional LHMs,29–37 almost all the LHM implementations to date have had the topology proposed by Pendry23,24 consisting of a split-ring resonator (SRR) and continuous wires (Fig.1a), which shows left-handed (LH) behavior for an incident plane wave with the electric field polarized parallel to the continuous wire and magnetic field perpendicular to the SRR. The SRR structure has been scaled down in size (and thus upwards in frequency) to produce metamaterials active at terahertz frequencies.38,39 For optical frequencies, the pair of short slabs (Fig. 1b) provide a resonant magnetic response analogous to that of the SRR, associated with strong anti-parallel currents in the two slabs of the pair.17,40,41 The main advantages of the slab-pair design compared to the SRR are its simplicity and capability of producing LH behavior for incidence normal to the plane, thus enabling a strong LH response with only one slab layer. Combining the pairs of slabs with continuous wires gives the fishnet structure31,42–44 (Fig. 1c), and this design has been widely adopted for fabricating LHMs at THz and optical frequency.12,14
 Fig. 1  Three types of LHM designs. (a) SRR & wire structure, (b) short slab pair structure, and (c) fishnet structure. 
We firstly introduced the dendritic structure45–48 shown in Fig. 2a. The dendritic cell (artificial molecule) can be viewed as a combination of 8 hexagonal split rings aligned in an annular manner, which is regarded as a V-shaped core (artificial atom). For an incident wave with magnetic field perpendicular to the plane, the metamaterials composed of dendritic cells are able to realize magnetic resonance in a similar way to the SRR. When combined with continuous wires, the overall LH behavior is achieved.45

(b) The anisotropic multilevel dendritic structure. (c) The current distribution of the electric resonant mode. (d) The current distribution of the magnetic resonant mode. 
A further study presented that the dendritic structure has two resonant modes.49Fig. 2c shows the electric resonance mode. In this mode, the positive and negative charges distribute on the two ends of the dendritic structure along the electric field direction, producing similar plasma behavior as an electric-LC resonator,50,51 thus it provides the negative permittivity. Fig. 2d shows the magnetic resonance mode. In this mode, the direction of surface current on the left side branches is opposite to that on the mirror-symmetry right side. So both side branches combining with the middle branches can produce four circle currents flowing in the same direction. The entire unit cell is similar to four coupled SRRs, which is actually equivalent to a resonant magnetic dipole. The proposed dendritic structure employing a single resonant unit could achieve both electric and magnetic resonances at the given frequency with proper parameters.49,52,53
The dendritic cell is in fact a fractal structure. The basic unit is a “V”. Fig. 2b shows the three-level dendritic cell.54 Under the condition of parallel incidence, this structure produces an electric resonance and multiple magnetic resonances in different frequencies. We then tune the magnetic resonance peak inside the negative permittivity regime by varying the dimension of dendritic geometry so as to achieve a left-handed transmission band.
Preparing the metamaterial for normal incidence, a conventional design is a metal–dielectric–metal sandwich structure, such as the fishnet44,55 and wire pairs.17,35 Similarly, for the EM wave incident and polarization as shown in Fig. 3a, the dendritic cell pairs contribute to magnetic resonance. Simultaneously, the dendritic cell pairs show cut-wire's behavior in the E direction, bringing negative permittivity in a certain frequency band. However, it is difficult to realize negative permittivity and negative permeability at the same frequency. Therefore, two different sizes of dendritic cell pairs are designed here to achieve the overlapping of negative permittivity and negative permeability. By doing so, the left-handed band is obtained.56 An alternative design is shown in Fig. 3b. For EM wave normal incidence, Yao57 found that a single three-level dendritic cell could realize magnetic resonance and electric resonance at different frequency bands. Moreover, for multiple layers of three-level dendritic structures, the intense interactions between the layers superposed the magnetic resonance and electric resonance, resulting in a left-handed peak.

As a consequential work of the two-dimensional (2D) dendritic metamaterial, a model of a three-dimensional (3D) sphere–rod shaped structure (Fig.4) is presented.58 Based on the Drude model of the dielectric function of silver in the visible region, the parametric curves of electromagnetic response to the incident fields have been retrieved from detailed simulations. Under the condition that the ratio of lattice constant to operating wavelength meets the requirement of the effective medium theory, adjusting its geometrical parameters can make the structure give rise to a negative refractive index. By further scaling down and optimizing its geometric parameters, it is found that the response of negative refraction can be shifted from red-light to blue-light frequencies. The spectral band of the calculated negative refractive index is broader than that of simultaneously negative permeability and permittivity, and this phenomenon can be explained by calculating the value of the negative refractive index. The model has the advantages of simplicity and isotropy, and is expected to be obtained from the “bottom-up” approach of chemical synthesis, which also offers a feasible route to the massive and low-cost fabrication of optical metamaterials.

3. Copper dendritic metamaterials with negative magnetic response
In this section, the fabrication of the copper dendritic metamaterial with an electrochemical deposition method is introduced.59–61 The prepared metamaterial shows the characteristic of negative magnetic response. When combined with silver film, which provides the negative permittivity at optical frequency, the planar composite exhibits LH phenomena such as pass-band and slab focusing effects.62
Both the copper dendritic cells and silver film were prepared by an electrochemical deposition method.63,64 We use a carbon fiber with a diameter of 5 μm as a cathode electrode, while the anode electrode is an ordinary annular copper electrode about 40 mm in diameter and 2 mm in thickness. The electrolyte is a mixture of CuSO4 and H2SO4 solution. The dimension of the obtained samples is mainly controlled by the deposition voltage. After electro-deposition, the sample is treated with dilute NaOH solution and distilled water, followed by a drying process prior to testing. For the fabrication of the silver film, the electrolyte is a mixture of AgNO3 and polyethylene glycol-10000 aqueous solution; the anode and cathode are graphite and indium tin oxide coated glass, respectively.


          Fig. 5a shows the optical photograph of a copper dendritic structure deposited under the voltage of 6.0 V. The prepared dendritic structure covered an area of about 100 mm2. The optical micrograph exhibits that the dendritic cells contain multilevel structure and good comparability in all directions. Fig. 5b shows the optical and scanning electron micrograph of the silver film.

Fig. 6a shows transmission spectra of the copper dendritic structure, silver film, and the composite planar medium. The copper dendritic structure produces a stop band at 1.92 μm, showing the relative amplitude about 25%. The silver film reflects most of the incident light with the transmission coefficient below 20%. For the composite, a pass-band appears at 1.92 μm where the copper dendritic structure shows a stop band. Note that this is quite similar to the SRRs and wire structure at microwave frequency. Fig. 6b indicates the power distribution along the propagation direction. A clear imaging at the other side of the composite is observed. Since no imaging effect is obtained by using either the copper dendritic structure or silver film, the proposed composite planar medium is demonstrated to be truly left-handed.

LH behavior at infrared frequencies is acquired by a planar medium composed of a copper dendritic structure and silver film. The copper dendritic structure has quasi periodic hexagonal cells, and the silver film is prepared using the electrochemical deposition method. The transmission spectra in the range of 1.28–2.5 μm showed that the copper dendritic structure exhibited a stop band while the silver film appeared at the low transmittance of 20%. It can also be seen that the planar medium exhibited a pass-band with a relative amplitude of about 15% at 1.92 μm, which is in good agreement with the stop band of the copper dendritic structure. The focusing experiment confirmed that a clear image appeared at the wavelength close to 1.92 μm at the other side of our lens composed of the copper dendritic cells and silver film. The distance between the lens and the point with maximum light intensity is about 30 μm.
4. Fabrication of infrared LHMs via double template assisted electrochemical deposition
Here, we report sandwich structural LHMs composed of an indium tin oxide (ITO) slice, zinc oxide dielectric spacer, and silver dendritic cell array. The overall procedure of fabricating a silver dendritic cell array is represented in Fig. 7.65–67 First, a polystyrene (PS) colloidal crystal template on the ITO substrate was assembled by the film transfer technique.68 Then, a porous ZnO template was fabricated using the electrochemical deposition method.69,70 The diameter and the depth of the bowl-like structure are controlled by the deposition time. To obtain a compact ZnO template, an appropriate concentration of Zn(NO3)2 and applied voltage is needed. After deposition of ZnO, the CH2Cl2 solution is used to dissolve the PS microspheres, and then the porous ZnO template is obtained. Finally, silver dendritic cells are deposited in the center of the ZnO bowls through the electrochemical method. In order to obtain an appropriate silver dendritic structure, polyglycol (PEG)-20000 is used as a dispersing and structure directing agent.71 The spacing between the anode and cathode is important. Otherwise, the silver dendritic structures would grow randomly on either the surface or bottom of the ZnO bowl.

(I) The fabrication of a 2D polystyrene (PS) colloidal crystal template, (II) electrochemical deposition of ZnO nanoparticles, (III) a porous ZnO template after removal of the PS microspheres, and (IV) the fabrication of the silver dendritic cell array. 
The final products are 10 × 20 mm2 microchips consisting of an indium tin oxide slice, zinc oxide dielectric spacer, and the silver cell array. Fig. 8a shows scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of silver dendritic cells deposited periodically in the ZnO template, and Fig. 8b is a zoomed image of a single dendritic cell. A silver dendritic cell is seen at the bottom of the ZnO bowl. No silver structures or particles are observed in the area outside the bowl.

(c) Transmission spectra of the copper dendritic structure (black), silver dendritic cell array (green), and porous ZnO template (blue). (d) The measured intensity distribution along the transverse at the image plane (20 μm away from the sample) with and without the silver dendritic cell array. 

Fig. 8c is the transmission spectra of the as-prepared sample, which shows a clear transmission peak with a relative magnitude about 6% around the 1.85μm region. The further novel slab focusing effect demonstrated that this peak contributes to the left-handed response. In particular, Fig. 8d shows the transverse power distribution 20 μm away from the surface of the sample. In the presence of the LHMs sample, a clear imaging point was observed due to the much higher detected power than that without the lens.
A sandwich-structured LHM covering a centimeter area, composed of an indium tin oxide slice, zinc oxide dielectric spacer, and silver dendritic cell array, have been fabricated by using a double template-assisted electrochemical deposition method. By adjusting the concentration of PEG-20000, the geometry of the dendritic structure can be precisely controlled at the 10 nm level, and the magnetic resonance frequency of the silver dendritic cell array can be modulated easily. When the concentration of PEG-20000 is 1.2 mM, the caliber and entire thickness of the as-prepared ZnO bowl-like structure cell are 2.2 μm and 0.8 μm, respectively. The whole size of the as-prepared dendritic structure is 1.5 μm with a branch width of about 80 nm. In the avoidance of fabricating negative permittivity and permeability materials separately and combining two of them on the nanometer scale, this method merely requires fabrication of a silver dendritic structural array on a conducting substrate, providing a facile, lower-cost method to fabricate LHM of larger areas at IR and even visible light frequencies.
5. Multiple pass-bands optical LHMs based on random dendritic cells
A metal–dielectric–metal sandwich structure with different sizes of dendritic cells could be implemented for LHMs. In this section, we introduce the chemical actualization of the sandwich structure LHM.72–76
First of all, the nanostructures of silver dendritic cells were prepared on a conductive glass substrate by an electrochemical deposition method.77–79 In order to obtain a large area of silver dendritic cells, flat electrodes were used. In this procedure, the applied voltage was adjusted from 0.2 to 1.0V with constant conditions of electrode area and spacer, electrolyte concentration, and deposition time, to obtain silver dendritic cells of different sizes. Then, a PVA film with a nanometer-scale thickness was prepared and located on the silver dendritic cells by a vertical lifting deposition method. Its thickness was controlled by adjusting the PVA concentration and lifting speed.80 Finally, a sandwich structural LHM was fabricated with two samples of silver dendritic cells. These two samples were deposited under the same applied voltage, but only one of them was coated with PVA film. During the fabrication process, the two samples were agglutinated face to face using a-ethyl cyanoacrylate, and the gap at the edge of the samples was air-proofed using silicone sealant.

Fig. 9a shows a SEM image of the sample prepared with an applied voltage of 0.6 V. Each dendritic cell is composed of a main trunk and side branches. The size and the distribution density of dendritic cells could be controlled by applying different voltages. As the applied voltage increases, the diameter of the dendritic cells decreases but the distribution density increases dramatically. Fig. 9b is a photograph of the sample.

Fig. 10a shows the infrared transmission spectra of the samples before and after being fabricated into the sandwich structure. Curve A and B are the transmission spectrum of the silver dendritic structure coated and uncoated with PVA film, respectively, and C is of the sandwich structure. Prior to the fabrication, no pass-band is observed for the silver dendritic structures either coated with a PVA film or not. However, once fabricated into a sandwich structure, the sample revealed an intensive multiple pass-band property in the range of 1.28–2.60 μm with a transmittance from 11 to 59%. It was shown that the defect of SSR would not cause significant change of the LHMs property.81–83

(b) A measured result of the field amplitude with the infrared receiver moving along the x and y directions. 
To further demonstrate our results, a slab focusing experiment was performed. The results revealed that a clear point image was focused at about 13 μm away from the test sample. When the wavelength that corresponds to the peak of the transmission spectrum in Fig. 10a was utilized, the focused point was present at the other side of the test sample. However, if the wavelength corresponding to the vale was utilized, the focused point wasn't present.
A nano-assembly approach was established to fabricate optical LHMs using a random dendritic nanostructure. The random silver dendritic cells were prepared on a conductive glass substrate. They were fabricated into a sandwich-like structure with a dielectric medium of PVA film to realize the left-handed effect at infrared frequencies. The above remarkable research result is a breakthrough in the understanding of the left-handed effect since it has always been considered effective for periodical structures from the conventional standpoints. In contrast to the previously reported narrowband and high loss LHMs, our LHMs composed of silver dendritic cells of different sizes achieved a multi-band resonance and broadband left-handed effect (1.28–2.60μm); the intensity of the transmission within the pass-band is greatly increased, exceeding 50% at some frequencies. In addition, the dimension of the as prepared samples was on the scale of hundreds of square millimeters (10 × 30mm), which greatly exceeded the samples prepared by a ‘top-down’ approach (on the scale of square micrometers). It was considered that the nano-assembly approach is facile, of lower cost, and effective for fabricating LHMs at optical frequencies, and thus would be of significance to accelerate the development of optical metamaterials.
6. Three-dimensional optical metamaterials consisting of metal-dielectric stacks
The dendritic silver nano-cell is designed as a “meta-atom” to fabricate optical metamaterials (OMMs).84 Silver dendrite was prepared using poly-amidoamine (PAMAM) as a protective agent, and then assembled on a glass substrate by a nano-assembly process and further fabricated into sandwich-like metamaterials with indium-tin-oxide (ITO) glass (Fig. 11). Through adjusting of the concentration of PAMAM, the geometry of the dendritic structure can be controlled at proper scale (Fig. 12), and the magnetic resonance frequency of the silver dendritic cells can be modulated easily. The size of silver dendrites prepared in 10 w/v% PAMAM is about 500 nm, and the dendritic cell is composed of a main trunk and side branches. However, a size of 300 nm on average can be obtained with 20 w/v% PAMAM. When the concentration of PAMAM is increased to 30 w/v%, spherical nanoparticles are obtained. This reveals that the concentration of PAMAM plays an important role in the growth of the silver particles.84 The optical transmission measurements indicate that these OMMs reveal pass-bands at 530 and 630 nm (Fig. 13), respectively. Furthermore, focusing experiments confirm the slab focusing effect of this sandwich-structured LHM lens, and the distance between the lens and the point with maximum light intensity is about 20 and 15 μm, respectively. Avoiding the limitations of expensive instrument systems and complicated processes of physical lithography, this method can be used effectively in producing LHMs at visible frequencies. In addition, the as-prepared samples have large effective areas of 8.5 × 27 mm, which greatly exceed the samples prepared by top-down approaches (in scale of square micrometer). It is also believed that such LHMs can lead to further understanding of the relation between the electromagnetic properties and structure (or shape) of basic cells.

Herein, we proposed three-dimensional MMs at visible frequencies based on random dendritic cells.85 The random silver dendritic cells were prepared in the presence of PAA and then stacked up multiplefunctional-layer MMs with dielectric PVA films (Figs 14 and 15). The multilayer-structured OMMs shows pass-bands at 650 nm (Fig. 16) and the slab focusing experiment reveals a clear point image. Besides, these disorder structures may not simplify the fabrication of optical metamaterials, or may even be advantageous, allowing for some tunability or a broadband behavior. It is also believed that such a method provides an intuitive picture to understand the optical properties of metallic nanostructures of complex geometries.

        Example of application: trapped rainbow effect at visible frequencies
Recently, slow light waveguides composed of LHMs and normal dielectric media have been proposed.86–89 It has been theoretically demonstrated that an axially varying left-handed heterostructure (LHH) with a metamaterial core of negative refractive index can efficiently and coherently trap light into a complete standstill status. Each frequency component of the wave packets stops at a position of different guide thickness, leading to the spatial separation of its spectrum, which is called the “trapped rainbow” effect.88 Here we experimentally demonstrate the trapped rainbow (Fig. 17) in tapered LHH at visible frequencies.90–92

(d) A transmission spectrum of LHMs at visible frequencies. (e) The frequency shift in the peak wavelength of the spectrum. 
The tapered LHH is composed of two LHMs with dimensions of 12 × 10 mm2. This is the largest metamaterial in size at visible frequencies. The inclination of the tapered air-cored LHH waveguide is varied between 0 and 5.5 × 10−3 rad. The LHMs in the tapered LHH are composite structures fabricated by the electrochemical deposition method72 as follows: (1) a polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) film of 20–50 nm in thickness was prepared on a sheet of ITO conductive glass by a vertical lifting deposition method. The ITO conductive glass was lifted from the PVA aqueous solution (3 wt%) at a speed of 0.4 mm min−1, and was then dried under ambient conditions. Afterward, the PVA film was solidified on the ITO conductive glass at 170 °C for 40 min in a sealed environment. (2) The sheet of ITO conductive glass covered with a PVA film was cut into slices with the dimensions of 12 × 10 mm2, and the silver dendritic structures were prepared on the slices by a nano-assembly method of electrochemical deposition. The ITO conductive glass slice was used as a working electrode (cathode), and a smooth silver slice with dimensions of 12 × 10 mm2 was used as a counter electrode (anode). The interspace between the two electrodes was controlled by polyvinyl chloride slices with a thickness of 0.6 mm. The electrolyte of AgNO3 (aqueous solution, 0.59 mmol) was added dropwise to the interspace between the two electrodes by capillary force. The electrochemical deposition was carried out at a direct current (dc) voltage of 0.9 V for 30 s; (3) another PVA film of 20–50 nm in thickness which acts as an electrically insulated interlayer in the LHM was prepared on the silver dendritic cells by a dropwise supernatant method using PVA aqueous solution (0.5 wt%), and then two slices were combined face to face to form a sample of left-handed metamaterials. The LHMs are composite structures of glass substrate/ITO film/PVA film/silver dendritic cells/PVA film/silver dendritic cells/PVA film/ITO film/glass substrate.
We measure the transmission spectrum of LHMs in the wavelength range from 400 to 750 nm with a step size of 10 nm employing an ultraviolet-visible spectrometer. The white light beam is at normal incidence to the LHMs sample. The result is indicated in Fig. 17d. Because the silver dendritic structure prepared by the electrochemical deposition method has a variety of structures and sizes, multiple left-handed transmission peaks in the transmission spectrum are observed.
To observe the trapped rainbow, a white collimated light beam is incident from the ordinary waveguide and then coupled into the LHH. The tapered fiber probe is moved 12 mm with steps of 0.2 mm during the measurement process, and the results are indicated in Fig. 17e. It can be seen that the peak wavelength of the measured spectrum shifts as the tapered fiber probe moves away from the origin of coordinate. This implies that the frequency components of the wave packet separate at positions with different guide thicknesses, leading to an appearance of a trapped rainbow.
In recent work,93 silver dendritic optical metamaterials are prepared using the electrochemical deposition method, and the transmission and focusing behaviors are investigated. The experimental results show that the samples reveal a multiple pass-bands transmission spectrum in the wavelength range from 600 to 1750 nm and a prominent focusing behavior at the wavelength corresponding to the maximum transmission coefficient. Two silver dendritic optical met materials are combined into a tapered optical waveguide, and the spectra of transmitted light at the surface of the tapered optical waveguide are measured by using the fiber spectrometer along the light propagation direction. The results demonstrate that if the wedge angle of the tapered waveguide is greater than zero and smaller than the critical value, each frequency component of the wave packet is stopped at a different guide thickness, leading to the spatial separation of its spectrum. The maximum shift in the peak wavelength is 12.2 nm mm−1 when the wedge angle is 1.5 milliradian. Fig. 18 shows the spectra of transmitted light from the upper surface of the tapered waveguide along the direction of light propagation.
 Fig. 18  Spectra of transmitted light from the upper surface of the tapered waveguide along the direction of light propagation measured by a fiber spectrometer. The origin of the coordinate is located on the interface of the ordinary waveguide and the negative refractive index waveguide. The peak wavelengths in measured spectra exhibit a red-shift property as the tapered fiber probe moves away from the origin of the coordinate. 
In ref. 88, the authors pointed out that the surface polariton modes could be totally suppressed and the light ray was permanently trapped in the ideal case, its trajectory forming an optical clepsydra. In our experiments, the surface polariton modes cannot be totally suppressed due to the loss of LHMs sample, however, each frequency component of the wave packet is stopped at a different guide thickness if the inclination of tapered LHHs is greater than zero and smaller than the critical value, leading to the spatial separation of its spectrum. The employed left-handed metamaterials are isotropic with the size of hundreds of square millimeters. Specifically, the LHMs sample at visible frequencies has a broad spectral range and low loss, making it an intrinsic optical response for the LHHs. It would have substantial influence on the applications such as quantum information processing, communication networks and signal processors.94
Recently, Yu et. al95 put forward light propagation with phase discontinuities by introducing plasmonic interfaces, consisting of an array of V-antennas. They have derived and experimentally confirmed generalized reflection and refraction laws and studied a series of intriguing anomalous reflection and refraction phenomena. The antenna arrays consist of a double-layer structure comprising a planar array of antennas and a ground plane in the case of reflectarrays or another array in the case of transmitarrays, separated by a dielectric spacer of finite thickness. Ni et. al96 have used a plasmonic nano-antenna array consisting of V-shaped gold antennas to introduce an abrupt phase discontinuity at the interface. The design works have unparalleled control of anomalous reflection and refraction, including negative refraction for a rather broad range of wavelengths from 1.0 to 1.9 μm. It is seen that an array of V-antennas and the case of reflectarrays or transmitarrays95,96 are very similar with a V-shaped core and a dendritic cell.45,65,72,90 In addition, metamaterials which contain inclusions embedded in host media97,98 with electromagnetic and acoustic characteristics, have been studied extensively and have shown promising application prospects. One major challenge in energy generation and conversion is to master the energy and information on the nanoscale to create materials and technologies with capabilities rivalling those of living systems. A novel kind of metamaterial particles (MMPs) with cell-like multicores/hierarchical structures has been designed and synthesized by a “one-pot” template assistant self-assembly method focusing on enhancing the mechanical/electrical energy transformation efficiency of electrorheological fluid.99 By adjusting the property of materials both treated as core and matrix, the MMPs can have extensive and exciting prospects in magnetorheological suspensions, dye-sensitized solar cells,100,101 electro- or photo-luminescent powders102,103 and so on.
8. Conclusions and outlook
Owing to peaking interest in the field of optical metamaterials, vast amounts of materials, methods, and characterization techniques are in development for applications in stealth technology, subwavelength devices, and new applications in optics and communications. Herein, we regard a V-shaped core as an artificial atom and a dendritic cell as an artificial molecule, and have highlighted the recent advances for the bottom-up fabrication of optical metamaterials, and demonstrated that the devices hold tremendous promise for slow light applications. We are now in a position to move forward and further develop the materials and methods that will make these novel materials useful. The state of the field has already led to facile, lower-cost, larger area samples of optical metamaterials. Current fabrication has also started to address the low-loss, as well as overcoming the challenges of flexible substrates. In the future, the realization of commercial applications will hinge on the continuous improvements in the stability and reproducibility of the devices in combination with industrial developments. Once these challenges are overcome, there exist a number of applications ranging from the stealth cloak to information processing systems to communication networks.
