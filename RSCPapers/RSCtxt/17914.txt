    , Accepted 20th June 2016First published on 22nd June 2016AbstractPerovskite solar cells (PSCs) with hole-conductor-free mesoscopic architecture have shown superb stability and great potential in practical application. The printable carbon counter electrodes take full responsibility of extracting holes from the active CH3NH3PbI3 absorbers. However, an in depth study of the CH3NH3PbI3/C interface properties, such as the structural formation process and the effect of interfacial conditions on hole extraction, is still lacking. Herein, we present, for the first time, an insight into the spatial confinement induced CH3NH3PbI3/C interface formation by in situ photoluminescence observations during the crystallization process of CH3NH3PbI3. The derived reaction kinetics allows a quantitative description of the perovskite formation process. In addition, we found that the interfacial contact between carbon and perovskite was dominant for hole extraction efficiency and associated with the photovoltaic parameter of short circuit current density (JSC). Consequently, we conducted a solvent vapor assisted process of PbI2 diffusion to carefully control the CH3NH3PbI3/C interface with less unreacted PbI2 barrier. The improvement of interface conditions thereby contributes to a high hole extraction proved by the charge extraction resistance and PL lifetime change, resulting in the increased JSC valve.
Introduction
Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite materials have recently emerged as an amazing star in the field of photoelectronic applications.1–5 The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has surged from 3.8% to a certified 22.1%, making them one of the most promising candidates for the next generation solar cells.1,6 Despite the breakthrough on efficiency, the stability issue is currently a major bottle-neck for the practical application of PSCs, especially under high temperature, intensive illumination and continuous power output.7–12 In a typical device structure, 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-MeOTAD) is usually used as a hole transport material (HTM) to achieve a good PCE.13–15 However, the cost of spiro-MeOTAD is unexpectedly high, while the relatively low glass transition temperature and highly hygroscopic nature of the lithium salts dopant make it a short slab for stable PSCs.16,17 In 2014, a fully printable hole-conductor-free mesoscopic architecture was reported, which was demonstrated to be a good strategy for fabricating stable PSCs.18–20 This architecture is generally a triple layer mesoscopic TiO2/insulating layer (ZrO2 or Al2O3)/C scaffold holding perovskite absorber. All the three layers can be prepared via a screen-printing method with easy manipulation. The suitable work function of the carbon-based counter electrode and the ambipolar properties of CH3NH3PbI3 contribute to the effective photoelectric conversion process.20 The infiltration of perovskite is normally accomplished by drop casting with either a perovskite precursor solution or PbI2 solution. The former method is referred as a one-step reaction with the latter followed by soaking in CH3NH3I solution and therefore referred to as “two step” reaction.13 Based on the microscopic structure, researchers have explored new absorber materials by ion doping, e.g. (5-AVA)x(CH3NH3)1−xPbI3 (5-AVA = 5-aminovaleric acid) and CH3NH3PbI(3−x)(BF4)x.18,21 On the other hand, without a hole conductor, the photogenerated holes from the perovskite absorbers would suffer from relatively weak extraction directly from the counter electrodes. There have been reports on the addition of NiO, graphene and carbon nanotubes with higher hole mobility to enhance the hole collection efficiency, implying that the CH3NH3PbI3/C interface was the main limitation for the photocurrent output of printable hole-conductor-free mesoscopic PSCs when compared with conventional PSCs.22–24 Therefore, the investigation of hole-conductor-free mesoscopic PSCs, especially the CH3NH3PbI3/C interface, which mainly limits the power conversion efficiency, is of great significance; however, this area lacks an in depth study.
Study on the internal properties in this PSC architecture must face the following problems. First, the carbon electrodes absorb almost the whole visible light region, hindering the use of some conventional characterization methods such as UV-Vis absorption and microscopic examination. Second, the distribution of perovskite into a carbon electrode is totally disordered, creating a complex interface that makes it difficult to search for structural information and the working mechanism. Thus, the properties of the active CH3NH3PbI3/C interface, with such a tricky location, is extremely difficult to investigate, especially in an in situ way that will provide direct information on the reaction kinetics, crystallization process and structural formation.26,27 As far as we are concerned, no such work has been reported to date, though the importance of the interface in photoelectric devices is widely realized.
Herein, we have looked into the CH3NH3PbI3/C interface formation process in hole-conductor-free mesoscopic PSCs by in situ PL monitoring during the “two-step” reaction for forming CH3NH3PbI3. A spatial confinement induced CH3NH3PbI3/C interfacial contact was observed from the time evolution of PL signal. Then, we demonstrated the effect of the CH3NH3PbI3/C interface on hole extraction and therefore the photocurrent of the PSCs. Finally, by solvent vapor assisted treatment, we improved the distribution uniformity of PbI2 and achieved sufficient conversion of CH3NH3PbI3, leading to efficient CH3NH3PbI3/C interfacial contact and realizing a reproducible increase in the JSC value of PSCs. The in depth understanding and careful control of the CH3NH3PbI3/C interface could pave the way for the practical application of the hole-conductor-free mesoscopic PSCs.
Experimental
Fabrication of solar cells
Carbon paste was prepared as follows: 8 g of graphite powder was mixed with 2 g of carbon black powder (particle size: 30 nm) in 35 mL of terpineol. Then, 1 g of ZrO2 powder (particle size: 20 nm) and 1 g of hydroxypropyl cellulose were added, followed by ball milling overnight.
Fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) coated glass (YINGKOU OPV TCH NEW ENERGY CO., LTD, OPV-FTO22-7) was first etched with HCl solution and zinc powder and then cleaned sequentially with 2% Hellmanex™ detergent, deionized water, acetone, ethanol and isopropanol. The TiO2 compact layers were then deposited by atomic layer deposition (Beneq TFS 200). The mesoporous TiO2 layer was prepared with diluted TiO2 paste (18NRT from Dyesol Company; w/w = 1:3.5 in ethanol) by spin coating at 2000 rpm for 30 s and heated at 500 °C for 30 min. Then, the Al2O3 mesoporous layer was followed by spin coating with diluted Al2O3 paste (Sigma Aldrich, 702129; v/v = 1:2 in isopropanol) at 2000 rpm for 30 s and heated at 150 °C for 30 min. The mesoscopic carbon layer was finally screen-printed with the as-prepared carbon paste and sintered at 400 °C for 30 min. The thickness of the TiO2, Al2O3 and carbon layers was determined by SEM to be around 400 nm, 600 nm and 10 μm, respectively. The preparation of CH3NH3PbI3 was proceeded in a glove-box, starting with drop casting an appropriate amount (depending on the area of the carbon electrode) of PbI2 solution (Aldrich, 99.9985%; 1.3 M for the control group of the PbI2-DVT case), drying at 70 °C for 30 min and then immersing in a 0.063 M isopropanol (Sigma Aldrich, 99.9%) solution of CH3NH3I (Dyesol) for 10 min followed by annealing at 70 °C for 30 min. The CH3NH3PbI3-DVT method was performed by covering a petri dish spread with 10 μL of DMF on a complete solar cell at 70 °C for 5 min and then reannealing the device for 30 min to remove the residual solvent. As for the PbI2-DVT method, a petri dish spread with 10 μL of DMF was covered upon the substrate after PbI2 drop casting until a sufficient diffusion of the PbI2 solution. The whole process was accomplished at room temperature.
Characterization
The in situ PL observation setup was built, as shown in Fig. 1, with FluoroMax-3 (Jobin Yvon). The quartz glass used as substrates (also for the time-resolved PL decay measurements) meets the JGS1 standard so that the loss of emission signal was as low as possible. All measurements were taken at room temperature of 25 °C. For the Al2O3 substrate, the PbI2 solution was spin coated; for the Al2O3/C substrate, the PbI2 solution was drop casted. 3 mL of CH3NH3I solution was poured once the PL signal was unchanged as a baseline. A PHI 5300 ESCA Perkin-Elmer spectrometer was used to acquire the top-down and cross-sectional SEM images with an accelerating voltage of 3 kV and the EDS line profile was analyzed with Aztec Energy software. The EIS characterization was performed using a electrochemical workstation (Zahner, CIMPS) and the frequency range was settled from 1 MHz to 1 Hz with an oscillation potential amplitudes of 10 mV under stimulated sunlight of 25 mW cm−2. XRD patterns were obtained using a Smart LAB instruments CuKα beam (λ = 1.54 Å). The PL lifetime was measured by fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) with a FV1200 laser scanning confocal microscope. A 488 nm pulsed diode laser was used for excitation using repetition rates at 40 MHz. The emission was filtered through a 50/50 dichroic beam splitter and a 700–800 nm long pass filter. The element content was obtained via ICP-AES measurements using a Thermal Fisher iCP QC and the samples were prepared by soaking the corresponding substrate in 20 mL of water and dilution to an appropriate concentration. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves were measured at a rate of 10 mV per step using a 2400 Series SourceMeter (Keithley Instruments) under simulated AM 1.5 sunlight of 100 mW cm−2 irradiance. The simulated sunlight was generated by a Thermo Oriel 91192-1000 simulator and the intensity was calibrated with a VLSI standards incorporated PN 91150V Si reference cell with a mismatch factor of less than 1%. The active area of the solar cells was determined by an aperture of 0.09 cm−2.

Results and discussion
We started by looking into the real-time “two-step” reaction process of the mesoscopic Al2O3 scaffold covered with and without a carbon electrode. The experimental setup was established with a reaction cuvette and a fluorospectrophotometer, providing time-resolved PL information. The reaction cuvette was home-built with prepared glass/Al2O3/PbI2 or glass/Al2O3/C/PbI2 substrates and a customized container attached to them holding the CH3NH3I solution. A schematic of the experimental setup is shown in Fig. 1a. Based on the steady-state PL measurements (Fig. S1†), the recorded emission spectrum of CH3NH3PbI3 was settled at 768 nm and 520 nm for PbI2. As shown in Fig. 1b, the PL intensity of CH3NH3PbI3 increased during the early stage and then dropped to a stationary value. This was believed to be a result of self-absorption of the luminescence by the perovskite formed.13 For PbI2, the PL intensity dropped immediately upon the addition of CH3NH3I, indicating an instant reaction between PbI2 and CH3NH3I. The uptrend of the PL signal started earlier for the glass/Al2O3/PbI2 substrates without carbon electrodes, compared to the substrates with carbon layers. It is acceptable that without carbon electrodes, the CH3NH3I solution will immediately come into contact with PbI2, leading to a much earlier formation of CH3NH3PbI3 in the mesoporous Al2O3 scaffold, while the cover of carbon layers will delay the diffusion of the CH3NH3I solution. The detectable drop of PL intensity for the glass/Al2O3/C/PbI2 substrates at the beginning of recording was resulted from the scattering of PL in CH3NH3I solution, which was covered up by the immediate change of PL signal without carbon electrodes. In addition, the dwelling time at the maximum PL intensity was longer and the drop rate of PL intensity was slower with the carbon layer, indicating a much slower CH3NH3PbI3 conversion when compared with the glass/Al2O3/PbI2 substrates. As the concentration of the CH3NH3I solution was increased, the PL signal changed, became faster and the time for its stabilization clearly shortened for both substrates, which was consistent with the fact that a higher concentration of CH3NH3I solution facilitates the CH3NH3PbI3 formation reaction (Fig. S1b†).28 We used the generalized Avrami model to fit the PL intensity decay of PbI2 and extracted the kinetics constant (k), as shown in Fig. 1c. Consequently, we can quantitatively analyze the reaction and crystallization kinetics for the formation of CH3NH3PbI3 in the mesoscopic PSCs with carbon counter electrodes. The Avrami approach, deduced from the balance between nucleation and crystal growth, was used to describe the phase transformation of solids and provide information on the crystallization mechanism.29,30 When the concentration of CH3NH3I solution was 0.126 M, the kinetics constant for the glass/Al2O3/C/PbI2 substrate was ∼24 times larger than that found for the glass/ Al2O3/PbI2 substrate, while for the dilute CH3NH3I solution of 0.032 M, this gap was reduced by ∼6 times. The increasing trend of kinetics constant was significantly smaller for the carbon electrode system, indicating a reduced concentration of CH3NH3I solution when in contact with the underlying PbI2 film. In this regard, the covered mesoscopic carbon layers consumed CH3NH3I in advance rather than functioning as a simple mesoscopic screen. We believe this is caused by the pre-reaction and consumption of CH3NH3I by PbI2 in the mesoscopic carbon layer. With a high concentration CH3NH3I solution, the consumption of CH3NH3I was fast and the reduction in concentration was obvious; with a low concentration, the reaction and crystallization was slowed down; therefore, the consumption of CH3NH3I was much less before it reached the underlying PbI2 and induced an increased PL intensity. Although the role of the CH3NH3PbI3 in upper layer of the carbon electrodes was not determined, the influence on the reaction kinetics is here proposed and this in situ PL observation is an effective way to provide information on the reaction kinetics of the mesoscopic PSCs.
During the in situ monitoring of the PL signal, an interesting phenomenon was brought to our attention. After complete formation of CH3NH3PbI3 (typically 600 s), we continued to collect the PL signal. As shown in Fig. 1d, in the cases of the glass/Al2O3/C/PbI2 substrates, the PL signals stayed unchanged all the time, while the signal slowly increased for the glass/ Al2O3/PbI2 substrates without a carbon layer. Moreover, as the concentration of CH3NH3I solution increased, the increasing trend of PL intensity became much more obvious, especially in the case of 0.126 M. It was reported that upon increasing the concentration of CH3NH3I solution, the CH3NH3PbI3 crystals in the capping layer grew smaller and denser, which was consistent with SEM images of the fresh CH3NH3PbI3 films (Fig. S3†).28,31,32 Upon prolonging the reaction time, the size of the CH3NH3PbI3 crystals became larger with CH3NH3PbI3 nanowires, nanorods, and nanoplates being formed via a dissolution-recrystallization process, especially when the concentration of CH3NH3I solution was high.31 We analyzed the CH3NH3PbI3 crystal size distribution and found a clear increasing trend, especially for the case with a 0.126 M CH3NH3I solution. This trend exactly coincided with the trend of PL activation. The photo-induced activation of CH3NH3PbI3 with a continuous increase in PL intensity was reported before and was attributed to the filling of subgap trap states during excitation.33,34 We believed that the CH3NH3PbI3 crystals after recrystallization had better crystal quality and suppressed the trap states, thus lessening non-radiative recombination and leads to an increased PL intensity. In this case, the trend of PL activation in turn reflects the increase in the CH3NH3PbI3 crystal size. Taking into account that the PL activation process fails to work for the cases with carbon electrodes, we speculate that the mesoscopic carbon layer restricts the growth of CH3NH3PbI3 crystals upon the Al2O3 layer. This spatial confinement effect ensures effective CH3NH3PbI3/C interfacial contact, which will be discussed later. Herein, the active CH3NH3PbI3/C interface locates at the bottom of the carbon electrodes, connecting the active CH3NH3PbI3 absorbers in the mesoporous Al2O3 scaffold with the carbon materials and we outlined this target interface in Fig. 2 for clarity.

Fig. 3 shows the cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the different substrates. The size of CH3NH3PbI3 crystals on the capping layer of the TiO2/Al2O3/CH3NH3PbI3 substrate was much larger than the thickness of the CH3NH3PbI3 layer formed between the carbon layer and the Al2O3 layer of the TiO2/Al2O3/C/CH3NH3PbI3 substrate, indicating the restriction of crystal growth by the carbon layer. We also noticed that in the hollows of the carbon layer, the presence of micrometer-sized CH3NH3PbI3 crystals shows evidence for the spatial confinement effect of the carbon layer as we proposed. However, this type of crystal with poor contact with the carbon layer would definitely contribute nothing to hole extraction. Therefore, we started our investigation on the effect of the CH3NH3PbI3/C interfacial contact and sought ways to improve the interface conditions.

Note that all cases were with the same reaction time. 
For a carbon-electrode-based hole-conductor-free mesoscopic PSC, the pathway from the perovskite materials to carbon electrodes, the CH3NH3PbI3/C interface in this case, takes full responsibility for hole extraction. Aiming to investigate the effect of the CH3NH3PbI3/C interfacial contact, we conducted solvent vapor assisted methods to induce change in the target interface without destructing the whole mesoscopic layer, by which we could directly evaluate the effect of the CH3NH3PbI3/C interfacial contact. Dimethyl formamide (DMF) solvent vapor treatment has been used to increase the crystallinity and grain size of perovskite films via dissolution-induced self-repair and recrystallization.35–37 Herein, we selected DMF vapor treatment (CH3NH3PbI3-DVT) to reconstruct the as-formed CH3NH3PbI3/C interface. This was simply performed by covering a device under a petri dish on a 70 °C hot plate and then dripping a small amount of DMF in the petri dish to create a DMF vapor atmosphere. Fig. S5a and S5b† illustrate that the CH3NH3PbI3-DVT method could “melt down” the capping layer CH3NH3PbI3 crystals to refill the mesoporous substrates. Fig. S5d and e† intuitively showed the moving down of the CH3NH3PbI3 after DMF treatment. The CH3NH3PbI3 capping layer at the CH3NH3PbI3/C interface region disappeared as well. Consequently, this recrystallization process induced the migration of CH3NH3PbI3 from the carbon layer into the under layer or at least reformed their contact, cutting off the hole quenching pathways from the carbon electrodes and result in a significant increase in the PL intensity, as shown in Fig. 4a. Therefore, the “bad” CH3NH3PbI3/C interfacial contact could not efficiently undertake the task of transferring the photogenerated holes to the external circuit, leading to a markedly reduced JSC value. Among all the factors that determine the JSC value of a solar cell, the decreased hole extraction efficiency, related to the CH3NH3PbI3/C interface should be responsible for the decrease of JSC after CH3NH3PbI3-DVT, because the light harvesting and electron injection efficiencies may be in some way elevated due to a relatively denser active layer.

(b) The charge extraction resistance of the carbon-electrode and Au-electrode mesoscopic PSCs under different bias voltage. The RCE was extracted from EIS measurements under illumination (25 mW cm−2). (c) The J–V curves of the carbon-electrode mesoscopic PSCs with and without DMF vapor treatment of CH3NH3PbI3 and Au-electrode mesoscopic PSCs. All the devices have an identical configuration for the mesoporous TiO2 and Al2O3 layer. 
Moreover, we fabricated hole-conductor-free CH3NH3PbI3 heterojunction solar cells by directly evaporating the Au electrodes on the TiO2/Al2O3/CH3NH3PbI3 substrates. The CH3NH3PbI3 capping layer was extremely rough because of the scattered large CH3NH3PbI3 crystals, as shown in Fig. 3c and S5a.† Therefore, it was undoubted that the deposited Au electrode with a thickness of 60 nm would be discontinuous (Fig. S5c†). This poor condition of contact severely influenced the hole extraction process, as reflected by the increase in the charge extraction resistance (RCE), as shown in Fig. 4b, and not surprisingly, the JSC values were relatively low. It was demonstrated that in hole-conductor-free perovskite heterojunction solar cells, a careful control of the perovskite film morphology was crucial and a decent JSC value was almost impossible to obtain unless sufficient contact between the counter electrode and active absorber layer was achieved.38,39 The case with Au electrodes provided complementary evidence of the importance of the interface between CH3NH3PbI3 and counter electrodes. It is noteworthy that despite of being a thicker film with a mesoporous quality, the carbon electrode basically serves an identical function as the Au electrode. The mesoporous quality of the carbon electrodes makes it easier to form sufficient contact with the perovskite materials, which we have demonstrated above. In addition, it was intriguing that this degree of poor interfacial contact between CH3NH3PbI3 and the electrode of carbon or Au did not noticeably affect the VOC value of the devices, although the VOC values were relatively low compared with the conventional devices with hole transport layer due to the intrinsic larger gaps between quasi-Fermi levels of electrons and holes. It was delightful that the DMF solvent assisted treatment could separate the effect of the CH3NH3PbI3/C interface without inducing structural change, so that we could observe a direct relationship between the interfacial condition and the JSC parameter of device. Therefore, the JSC value can be an important index for the condition of the CH3NH3PbI3/C interfacial contact, in other words, the hole extraction efficiency of the carbon electrodes.
Realizing the importance of the CH3NH3PbI3/C interface on hole extraction, we then proceeded to control this crucial interface for a better hole extraction process. During optimization of the preparation technology, we found that increasing the concentration of the PbI2 solution resulted in an increase in the fill factor (FF), which benefited from a better CH3NH3PbI3 filling in the active mesoporous layers (TiO2 and Al2O3), as we proved in Fig. S6.† However, when the concentration of PbI2 solution was increased, the reaction of PbI2 with CH3NH3I became both incomplete and inhomogeneous, and there were visible yellow areas around the device indicating unreacted PbI2 (Fig. S7b†). During the dynamic balance between PbI2 solution diffusion and DMF solvent vapor evaporation, PbI2 tended to crystallize on the edge of the solution, like a “coffee ring effect”, forming an uneven distribution of PbI2 through the whole carbon layer. From elemental analysis of the cross-sectional EDS line scan in Fig. S7a,† we observed that the elemental content of Pb and I, representing PbI2, simultaneously increased with that of C and maximized on both sides of graphite sheets, indicating that PbI2 preferred to be located at the surface of the carbon materials. Therefore, the undesired accumulation of PbI2, especially with a higher concentration PbI2 solution, would inevitably retard the full infiltration of CH3NH3I solution and resulted in an incomplete reaction. The unreacted PbI2 then prevented contact between CH3NH3PbI3 and the carbon electrodes beneath, which was harmful for the hole extraction process.
To solve this problem, we used DMF vapor treatment during the diffusion process of PbI2 (PbI2-DVT) at room temperature, which was a more gentle way when compared with the former CH3NH3PbI3-DVT method. With a slower DMF evaporation rate under the solvent vapor environment, the diffusion of PbI2 would be much more sufficient and uniform. Consequently, the reaction between PbI2 and CH3NH3I was more complete. Fig. 5a showed the in situ PL observation for each reaction process. By applying the PbI2-DVT method, the PL signal of CH3NH3PbI3 appeared earlier and ended up later with a much lower intensity, indicating the smooth infiltration of the CH3NH3I solution and efficient quenching of holes by the carbon electrodes. The decay of steady-state PL intensity shown in Fig. S8b† also supports this conclusion. Furthermore, the PbI2 diffraction peak in the XRD pattern disappeared in PbI2-DVT, proving a marked decrease in the unreacted PbI2 (Fig. 5b). Elimination of the PbI2 block would then effectively improve the CH3NH3PbI3/C interfacial contact.

(b) XRD patterns of the carbon-electrode mesoscopic PSCs with and without DMF vapor treatment of PbI2 at room temperature. The grey dash line depicts the position of PbI2. 
We then measured the photovoltaic performance, shown in Fig. 6a and summarized in Table 1. With a complete reaction and improved interface conditions, the JSC value, an important index for hole extraction efficiency, was markedly increased by around 12%, while the VOC and FF remained almost unchanged. External quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra provided evidence for the reliability of the increase in JSC with higher values in the long wavelength region, which is an indicator of reduced carrier recombination. It is reasonable that with lower energy, i.e., excited by light with longer wavelength, it is less likely for the photogenerated charge carriers to transfer across the barrier of the unreacted PbI2 and be collected by the carbon electrodes. The RCE directly shows the capacity of carbon electrode extracting holes from CH3NH3PbI3 at the corresponding CH3NH3PbI3/C interface. As shown in Fig. 6c, a clearly reduced RCE was obtained by applying the PbI2-DVT method, indicating a preferable hole transfer channel. To study the charge transfer kinetics at the CH3NH3PbI3/C interface, we performed the time-resolved PL decay of CH3NH3PbI3 with and without the PbI2-DVT (Fig. 6d). Note that the mesoporous TiO2 film was replaced by the mesoporous Al2O3 scaffold to avoid the electron quenching process. The average PL lifetime was obtained by biexponentially fitting the PL decay curve and averaging the two time constants in an amplitude-weighted way. The fitted parameters are summarized in Table 2. In general, the slow decay lifetime τ1 is considered to be the radiative decay of CH3NH3PbI3 itself and the fast decay lifetime τ2 represents the quenching of free carriers through charger transfer process, which was hole extraction by the carbon electrodes in this case.25,40 The time-resolved PL decay measurements provide two pieces of important information. One is that the control group shows a longer τ1, which can be attributed to the passivation effect of the unreacted PbI2. The other is that the application of PbI2-DVT increases the fraction of the fast decay process, indicating a more effective extraction of holes at the CH3NH3PbI3/C interface than that of the control group. We depicted the corresponding energy band gap diagram in Fig. 6e to show the effect of the PbI2-DVT method on the charge carrier transfer process in the devices.40 With a homogeneous distribution of PbI2 assisted by the DMF solvent vapor treatment, the reaction forming CH3NH3PbI3 is fast and thorough, avoiding the unreacted PbI2 hindering hole transfer and thus effectively improves the CH3NH3PbI3/C interfacial contact.

The passivation effect of PbI2 was claimed before, though being controversial, to retard carrier recombination and improve photovoltaic performance.40,41 One may wonder the difference in this study. In our defense, both the existence of residual PbI2 and its influence on hole extraction differed greatly. On the one hand, evidence for the PbI2 passivation effect was basically observed between CH3NH3PbI3 and TiO2 with an extremely small amount, but in our case, the unreacted PbI2 was accumulated on the counter electrodes and the amount was relatively large to be macroscopic.42,43 On the other hand, the introduction of HTM in this work provided sufficient contact and efficient hole extraction, but the band gap between CH3NH3PbI3 and carbon electrodes is relatively large and the process of hole transfer is, by contrast, more unfavorable, thus the unreacted PbI2 block is nothing but detrimental.
Finally, by applying the PbI2-DVT method, we achieved the best PCE of 12.30% with “two-step” prepared pristine CH3NH3PbI3 in the hole-conductor-free mesoscopic architecture, as shown in Fig. S11.† The improvement in photovoltaic performance, mainly due to the increase in JSC, demonstrated the possibility of careful control on the CH3NH3PbI3/C interface. With efficient hole extraction, the imbalance of the transport of electrons and holes in the hole-conductor-free architecture should be modified. Moreover, improvement of the PbI2 homogeneity will contribute to the up-scalable application of mesoscopic PSCs.
Conclusions
We observed in situ PL emission signal during the “two-step” reaction process for hole-conductor-free mesoscopic perovskite solar cells. A relatively slow reaction rate and stable PL signal evolution after the reaction indicated effective CH3NH3PbI3 filling in the mesoscopic carbon layer and spatial confinement induced CH3NH3PbI3/C interfacial contact, respectively. The CH3NH3PbI3/C interface is essential for the extraction of photogenerated holes from the active CH3NH3PbI3 absorbers and the hole extraction efficiency directly reflects the JSC parameter of the device. Furthermore, we achieved better CH3NH3PbI3/C interfacial contact by applying the PbI2-DVT method. The solvent vapor assisted PbI2 diffusion was homogeneous and therefore, the reaction was sufficient with the obstruction of unreacted PbI2 between CH3NH3PbI3 and carbon electrodes avoided. With a better understanding of the structural formation process and effect of the CH3NH3PbI3/C interface, careful control for further improvement and practical application are on the way.
