    , Accepted 12th September 2016First published on 13th September 2016AbstractTwo novel conjugated polymers based on benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) and isoindigo units linked with a 3-octylthieno[3,2-b]thiophene unit as a π-bridge were designed and synthesized. The two polymers named PBDT-TT-IID and PBDTT-TT-IID with the same acceptor unit and different donor unit showed similar molecular weight, absorption spectrum range, and molecular energy levels. Introduction of a thienyl group in PBDTT-TT-IID increased the conjugation degree of the backbone, expanded the absorption spectrum and improved the hole mobility. The film absorption spectrum of PBDTT-TT-IID exhibited a strong shoulder peak at 697 nm, which is attributed to the strong aggregation and highly ordered packing of the polymer chains in the solid state. The power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of the polymer solar cells (PSCs) based on PBDT-TT-IID and PBDTT-TT-IID achieved 6.31% and 8.05%, respectively. This is first time that efficiency over 8% based on isoindigo conjugated polymers in conventional devices, and it also has the possibility of further improvement. Moreover, these two polymers showed extremely high charge carrier transport including hole and electron mobilities on the 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1 magnitude. This shows their potential as high efficiency materials in polymer solar cells.
Introduction
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) with bulk heterojunction (BHJ) architectures have gained attention largely due to their low cost, lightweight, solution processability and flexibility.1–5 Efficient PSCs materials should have the following characteristics: broad and strong absorption to obtain more solar energy; suitable highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels that can utilize effective charge separation and ensure enough open-circuit voltage (VOC); good planarity and a high hole mobility; and finally, good solubility and being amenable to a solution-based process.6–11 Plenty of work has been done on designing donor–acceptor (D–A) alternating conjugated polymers, as they have shown great potential to produce high efficiency organic solar cells. It was found that applying certain D-units with A-units in the backbone could fine-tune the energy levels and the polymer bandgap, thus improving the photovoltaic performance of the PSCs. To date, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of PSCs based on D–A structured polymers and fullerene derivatives have exceeded 10% in typical BHJ devices.12–16 This strategy can effectively reduce the band gap and facilitate intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) between donor and acceptor parts.17 In addition, it is also flexible on a tunable molecular level using different donor or acceptor units. The well-known concept in molecular design of D–A polymers was “weak donor–strong acceptor”.18 That is, a weak donor with a weaker electron-donating ability offers a lower HOMO level, whereas a strong acceptor with a high electron affinity affords a deep LUMO level. As a result, a higher VOC can be obtained without broadening the bandgap.
Many of the reported effective D–A conjugated polymers contain a benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) unit.19–25 BDT is a highly planar structure of the donor unit, and the polymer based on it generally has a high hole mobility and low energy levels, thus becoming an important unit to construct efficient PSCs materials. Isoindigo (IID) is simple to synthesize and can be obtained from plants. This has been conducted successfully within the construction of D–A conjugated polymers over the past few years.26–29 The PCEs of IID-based conjugated polymers exceeded 7% in conventional devices.30,31 In this context, we use these two units to design D–A conjugated polymers. Some research groups have reported the effects of π-bridges between donor and acceptor segments on the properties of the polymers. Ma et al.32 reported that the number of thiophene spacers between BDT and IID impact solar cell performance, and the results showed that the polymer contained bithiophene spacers had superior performance. Ji-Hoon et al.33 reported a TPD-based D–A polymer PBDTT-ttTPD with a 6-alkyl thieno[3,2-b]thiophene (TT) π-bridge that exhibited a 6.81% PCE compared with a thiophene π-bridge of 4.4%. Wang et al.34 reported that the π-bridge has a decisive influence on the molecular structure of polymers. It also showed that the TT π-bridge was advantageous to the enhancement of polymer conjugation and broadens the absorption spectrum of a polymer to improve the photovoltaic performance. In summary, choosing the appropriate π-bridge for improving polymer conjugation and enhancing the PCE is very important.
In this study, we first introduced the alkyl TT unit as a π-bridge to IID-based conjugated polymers. With two different BDT-based donor units, alkoxy and thienyl substituted on BDT units, two new polymers were successfully synthesized by the Stille coupling reaction and named PBDT-TT-IID and PBDTT-TT-IID (Scheme 1), respectively. The introduction of the thienyl group in PBDTT-TT-IID could increase the conjugation degree of the backbone, expand the absorption spectrum and improve the hole mobility. Moreover, both PBDT-TT-IID and PBDTT-TT-IID had an extremely high number-average molecular weight (Mn) of 187 kDa and 184 kDa with a relatively narrow polydispersity index (PDI) of 1.52 and 1.58, respectively. These two polymers were used to fabricate PSCs devices and it was found that PBDTT-TT-IID showed superior performance with a PCE value of up to 8.05% with [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) as an electron acceptor in a conventional BHJ device configuration. This is the highest PCE based on IID conjugated polymers in conventional devices. PBDT-TT-IID also showed a PCE of 6.31% together with PC71BM. Compared with previously reported thiophene π-bridge,32 the introduction of octyl substituted TT not only ensured the polymers solubility, but also changed the shape of the molecular chains from zigzag to straight line. This facilitated thin film molecular packing, enhanced short-circuit current density (JSC), and improved the PCE.

Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization
The synthesis routes of the monomers and corresponding polymers are shown in Scheme 1. Monomer 3-octylthieno[3,2-b]thiophene (5) and N,N′-bis(2-hexyldecyl)-6,6′-dibromoisoindigo (8) were synthesized according to literature methods.35,36PBDT-TT-IID and PBDTT-TT-IID were synthesized by the Stille coupling reaction with palladium tetrakis(triphenylphosphine) (Pd(PPh3)4) used as the catalyst. By extracting with methanol, hexanes, and dichloromethane, some small molecular parts and oligomers were removed and the polymers were carefully purified. They could be easily dissolved in common solvents at room temperature, such as chloroform, tetrahydrofuran (THF), and 1,2-dichlorobenzene (DCB). Mn and PDI were obtained from gel permeation chromatography (GPC) using THF at 30 °C as the eluent and polystyrene as a standard. PBDT-TT-IID and PBDTT-TT-IID exhibited good thermal stability with onset decomposition temperatures corresponding to 5% weight loss all exceeding 350 °C (Fig. 1).

Optical and electrochemical properties
Optical properties of PBDT-TT-IID and PBDTT-TT-IID were measured with a UV-vis absorption spectrometer and the results of the polymer absorption are summarized in Table 1. Fig. 2 shows the optical absorption spectra of the polymers in a chloroform solution (a) and in the solid state (b). The absorption bands in the 340–500 nm and 500–800 nm ranges can be ascribed to localized π–π* transition, and ICT between the BDT units and the IID units, respectively. Compared with PBDT-TT-IID, the absorption spectra of PBDTT-TT-IID in a solution and solid state showed an absorption peak in the 372 nm vicinity. This may be attributed to the thienyl in BDT unit. The absorption spectrum of PBDT-TT-IID film demonstrated a weak absorption shoulder located at 687 nm, indicating that π–π stacking between the polymer backbones formed aggregates or ordered packing in the solid film. For PBDTT-TT-IID, the film absorption spectrum exhibited a strong shoulder peak at 697 nm. This should be attributed to the strong aggregation and highly ordered packing of polymer chains in the solid state, implying intense intermolecular interactions. The onset absorption (λonset) in the thin film state of PBDT-TT-IID and PBDTT-TT-IID were 772 and 763 nm, which corresponds to optical bandgaps (Eoptg) of 1.61 and 1.63 eV. This shows that the two polymers have band gaps that are similar in energy. The molecular energy levels of the two polymers were characterized by electrochemical cyclic voltammetry (CV). The onset oxidation potential (Eox)/onset reduction potential (Ered) of PBDT-TT-IID and PBDTT-TT-IID was 1.03/−0.68 and 1.02/−0.71 V versus the saturated calomel reference electrode (SCE), respectively, as shown in Fig. 2c. The HOMO and LUMO levels of these two polymers are calculated from the onset oxidation potential and the onset reduction potential according to the following equations:37 HOMO = −e(Eox + 4.34) (eV); LUMO = −e(Ered + 4.34) (eV). The HOMO levels of PBDT-TT-IID and PBDTT-TT-IID were −5.37 and −5.36 eV, respectively, and their LUMO levels were −3.66 and −3.63 eV, respectively (Fig. 2d). They had similar energy levels and band gaps. Having almost the same HOMO level shows that they have nearly the same VOC (the VOC is determined by the difference between the HOMO level of the donor and the LUMO level of the acceptor).

Theoretical calculations
Quantum chemistry calculations by the density functional theory (DFT) method were implemented to evaluate the impact of TT π-bridge on molecular architecture and the optoelectronic properties of these two polymers.38 The frontier molecular orbitals are shown in Fig. 3, along with the corresponding HOMO, LUMO levels, dihedral angles and bond angles (summarized in Table S1 in ESI†). The wave functions of the frontier molecular orbital exhibited that the HOMO surfaces of the polymers were delocalized along the entire π-conjugated backbones, whereas the LUMO surfaces were generally concentrated on the isoindigo-based acceptor sections. The dihedral angles for the BDT-TT-IID unit for A1, A2, and A3 were calculated to be −34.05°, 22.09°, and 23.23°, respectively. Similarly, those of the BDTT-TT-IID unit were −32.72°, −23.09°, and −23.66°. For these two molecules, the dihedral angles between different segments were approximately equal. The angles between the bonds across TT π-bridge of these two molecules were closed to 180°. The shape of the molecular chains was maintained linear.

Photovoltaic properties
To investigate the photovoltaic performance of the polymers, conventional BHJ PSC devices with a configuration of glass/indium tin oxide (ITO)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)/polymer:[6,6]-phenyl C71 butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM)/Ca/Al were fabricated and tested under the illumination of AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2. The best solvent to spin-coat active layers of PBDT-TT-IID and PBDTT-TT-IID were DCB and chloroform (CF), respectively. For these two polymers, the optimal ratio of polymer:PC71BM (D:A) was 1:1.5. The influence of different D:A ratios on the performance of PBDTT-TT-IID is summarized in Fig. S1 (ESI) and Table S2 (ESI).† The best performing device with a D:A ratio of 1:1.5 and spin-coated with 3% 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) (DIO/CF, v/v) presented a 7.2% PCE. In order to optimize the morphology of the active layer for the best photovoltaic performance of the devices, we used a component solvent with a high boiling point solvent additive, DIO. As shown in Fig. S2 (ESI) and Table S3 (ESI),† the device based on PBDT-TT-IID and PBDTT-TT-IID without DIO gave much lower PCEs of 3.37% and 2.09%, whereas a low JSC of PBDT-TT-IID and PBDTT-TT-IID was 9.04 and 5.22 mA cm−2, respectively. The influence of DIO on JSC is greater than the impact on VOC. Moreover, we studied the different solvent additives influence on the devices performance of PBDTT-TT-IID, which are summarized in Fig. S3 (ESI) and Table S4 (ESI).† We found that different additives had little effect on the VOC and a large impact of the JSC, thus resulting in an impact on the PCE. For PBDTT-TT-IID, diphenyl ether (DPE) is the best additive. Fig. 4a shows the current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the solar cells based on the PBDT-TT-IID:PC71BM (1:1.5, w/w) blend spin-coated with 3% DIO (DIO/DCB, v/v) and PBDTT-TT-IID:PC71BM (1:1.5, w/w) blend spin-coated with 3% DPE (DPE/CF, v/v), and the related photovoltaic properties are summarized in Table 2. The PSCs made of PBDTT-TT-IID:PC71BM blend exhibited the best PCE of 8.05% (an average PCE of 7.88% from over 20 devices) with a VOC of 0.79 V, a JSC of 14.14 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 0.72, whereas the devices made of PBDT-TT-IID blend showed a lower PCE (the best PCE of 6.31% with a VOC of 0.79 V, a JSC of 12.24 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.65). Very closed VOC of these two polymers was well verified by cyclic voltammetry measurements obtained with similar HOMO levels. The PCE of 8.05% is the highest efficiency based on IID conjugated polymers in conventional devices, and it also has the possibility for further improvement. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves of the optimized devices are shown in Fig. 4b, and all of them had a response in the 300–800 nm range. The highest EQE values of PBDT-TT-IID and PBDTT-TT-IID based devices were 54% and 63%, respectively. The JSC calculated from EQE values of PBDT-TT-IID and PBDTT-TT-IID was 11.77 mA cm−2 and 13.56 mA cm−2, respectively. The deviations between the integral current densities and the JSC read from J–V curves were under 5%, indicating a good consistency of the photovoltaic results. In addition, we performed a preliminary exploration of the relationship between the film thickness and the device performance of PBDTT-TT-IID:PC71BM blend (spin-coated with 3% DIO (DIO/DCB, v/v)). The photovoltaic properties are summarized in Fig. S4 (ESI) and Table S5 (ESI).† The active layer thickness of 100 nm achieved the best device performance (VOC = 0.77 V, JSC = 13.64 mA cm−2, FF = 0.68, PCE = 7.20%). As the film thickness increased to 210 nm, the performance of the device could be kept relatively high (VOC = 0.77 V, JSC = 11.96 mA cm−2, FF = 0.57, and PCE = 5.31%). Thicker active layers (over 200 nm) were preferred for large area printing of PSCs since thin layers can easily have pinhole defects and suffer from low performance reproducibility.39

We also researched the charge carrier transport in the device and the results are shown in Fig. 5. Fitting by the space charge-limited current (SCLC) model40 disclosed that the hole mobilities (μh) of PBDT-TT-IID:PC71BM and PBDTT-TT-IID:PC71BM blend were 1.59 × 10−2 and 6.23 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1, whereas the electron mobilities (μe) in these two devices were 2.08 × 10−2 and 7.34 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. PBDTT-TT-IID has a higher and more balanced charge carrier transport. Both of these polymers exhibited high μh and μe and this shows their potential as high efficiency PSC materials.

The results showed that an additive such as DIO could effectively improve the photocurrent by improving the morphology of active layers, due to the sensitivity of the device performance to the solvent additive. This conjecture was verified by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). As shown in Fig. 6, AFM images showed the morphology of the film surface. The film without DIO showed a root-mean-square roughness (RMS) value of 5.85 nm, whereas with 3 vol% DIO showed a 2.01 nm value for the PBDT-TT-IID:PC71BM blend. Similarly, the effect of DPE on PBDTT-TT-IID:PC71BM blend was even greater. Without DPE, the film exhibited large domains dispersed in the film and the RMS value was 8.32 nm, whereas the film added 3 vol% DPE shows fine structures with a 1.98 nm RMS value. The TEM images indicated that the PBDT-TT-IID:PC71BM film blend without DIO had similar branches of phase separation (about 60 nm in size) and PBDTT-TT-IID:PC71BM blend without DPE exhibited unevenly aggregated polymer and PC71BM domains, forming large grains of about 200 nm diameter. In contrast, the film with solvent additive was quite uniform without large aggregates. This facilitated exciton dissociation and led to higher JSC and FF values. Furthermore, we studied the effects of different solvent additives on the morphology of the film surface of the PBDTT-TT-IID:PC71BM blend. As shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†), the blend film with four different additives, including DIO, 1-chloronaphthalene (1-CN), DPE and N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP), all showed the ideal phase separation scale and simply varied by the surface roughness. The more evenly dispersed phase, the better the performance of the devices obtained.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we designed and synthesized two novel conjugated polymers based on BDT and isoindigo with a 3-octylthieno[3,2-b]thiophene unit as the π-bridge. The two polymers of PBDT-TT-IID and PBDTT-TT-IID exhibited adjacent properties such as high molecular weight and narrow PDI, absorption spectrum range, and molecular energy levels. In particular, the polymer of PBDTT-TT-IID using a thienyl substituted BDT unit achieved a high PCE of 8.05% with a VOC of 0.79 V, a JSC of 14.14 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.72. To the best of our knowledge, the PCE value of 8.05% is the highest efficiency based on IID conjugated polymers in conventional devices, and it also has the potential to increase further. In addition, these two polymers showed extremely high charge carrier transport, including hole and electron mobilities on the 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1 order of magnitude. The polymer film PC71BM blend with 3 vol% solvent additive developed nanoscale phase separation with a bicontinuous network structure, and this ideal morphology increased the effective D/A interface and thus raised the exciton dissociation probability. Therefore, the introduction of alkyl TT π-bridge is an effective strategy to enhance the photovoltaic performance based on isoindigo conjugated polymers. Moreover, PBDTT-TT-IID is a promising polymer donor with potential for commercial applications in large area PSCs.

Synthesis of PBDT-TT-IID. 
In a 25 mL dry flask, 2,6-bis(trimethyltin)-4,8-bis(2-ethylhexyloxy)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (M2-1) (147.5 mg, 0.191 mmol) and compound M1 (261.6 mg, 0.191 mmol) were dissolved in 6 mL of toluene and 1 mL of DMF. After being purged with nitrogen for 10 min, Pd(PPh3)4 (11.0 mg) was added and the mixture was then purged with nitrogen for another 20 min. The reaction mixture was stirred and heated to 112 °C for 40 h. After 40 h, 50 μL of tributyl(thiophen-2-yl)stannane was added to the reaction then one hour later, 25 μL of 2-bromothiophene was added and the reaction was refluxed overnight to complete the end-capping reaction. The polymer was purified by precipitation in methanol, filtered through a 0.45 μm Teflon filter and washed on Soxhlet apparatus with methanol, hexane, dichloromethane and chloroform for 24 h each. The chloroform fraction was reduced to 50–60 mL under reduced pressure and the remaining content was passed through a short silica gel column. The polymer was precipitated by adding into methanol. The solid was collected by filtration through a 0.45 μm Teflon filter and dried in vacuum oven overnight at 40 °C to afford PBDT-TT-IID (328.2 mg, yield: 94.5%). GPC: Mn = 187.8 kDa, Mw = 285.7 kDa.
