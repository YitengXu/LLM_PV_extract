    , Accepted 20th April 2017First published on 21st April 2017AbstractThe development of light harvesting systems based on heterostructures for efficient conversion of solar energy to renewable energy is an emerging area of research. Here, we have designed heterostructures by using carbon dots (C-dots) and zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NP) to develop an efficient light harvesting system. Interestingly, the conduction band and the valence band positions of ZnO NP are lower than the LUMO and HOMO positions of C-dots in this type II heterostructure of C dot–ZnO NP, which causes efficient charge separation and photocurrent generation. Steady state and time resolved spectroscopic studies reveal that an efficient photoinduced electron transfer occurs from C dots to ZnO NP and a simultaneous hole transfer occurs from the valence band of ZnO NP to the HOMO of C dots. The calculated rate of electron transfer is found to be 3.7 × 109 s−1 and the rate of hole transfer is found to be 3.6 × 107 s−1. The enhancement of photocurrent (11 fold) under solar light irradiation of the C dot–ZnO NP heterostructure opens up new possibilities to design efficient light harvesting systems.
Introduction
Significant attention has been given to the design of heterostructure nanomaterials owing to their potential applications in light harvesting systems such as photovoltaic and photocatalytic systems.1–7 Various metal–semiconductor hybrid nanostructures are found to be potential materials for photocatalysis,8,9 solar energy conversion,10,11 and photovoltaics,12 and have nonlinear properties13 because of their modification of electronic properties due to exciton–plasmon interactions.14,15 Emphasis has been given to type II core–shell semiconductors where both the valence and conduction bands of one component lie lower in energy than the corresponding bands of the counterpart material.16–18 The staggered alignment of band edges leads to an efficient spatial charge separation of electrons and holes, which is the essential requirement for the photovoltaic devices.18 Zinc oxide is known to have a wide band gap of 3.3 eV and a large exciton binding energy of approximately 60 meV which is disadvantageous for visible light harvesting.19,20 Thus, a narrow band gap semiconductor, dye molecules or metal nanoparticles are being used to couple with ZnO nanocrystals for efficient visible light harvesting.21 Nowadays, carbon based materials like graphene and carbon nanotubes are broadly used to form a composite with ZnO for photocurrent generation.22–24 An important strategy is band gap engineering by making core–shell structures like ZnO/CdS, ZnO/ZnS, ZnO/ZnxCd1−xSe etc. for enhancing the charge separation and photocurrent generation for photocatalysis and photovoltaic applications.21,25 By tuning the shell composition of the arrays of ZnO/ZnxCd1−xSe (0 ≤ x ≤ 1), optical absorption can be tuned throughout the entire visible region. It is found that the solar energy conversion efficiency can be enhanced up to 4.74% by tuning the visible light absorption maximum.26 Battaglia and coworkers have reported enhancement of the conversion efficiency to 10.1% when they used nanomodulated zinc oxide films as transparent front electrodes in amorphous silicon solar cells.27 The band gap and optical absorption can be tuned by forming quantum-well-like and nanowire-based type-II heterostructures of ZnO/ZnS.28 These heterostructures exhibit enhanced photocurrent conversion based on the truly wide band gap semiconducting 3D core/shell nanowire array.29 Based on this concept, we have designed a type II heterostructure by using carbon dots and zinc oxide nanoparticles. Here, fluorescent carbon dots are being used to replace the traditional semiconductor quantum dots because of their tunable electronic properties which are beneficial for developing high-performance energy conversion and storage devices.30,31 Defects in the π-electronic sp2 network of carbon dots and their nature are central for bright tunable photoluminescence emission.32 The π–π* and n–π* of carbon dots for ∼5.0 eV and ∼3.3 eV energies are responsible for their potential applications.33 Two types of transitions in carbon dots arise from the conjugated core and emissive surface states.34–36 It is stated that the emission corresponding to the conjugated core of carbon dots is due to the π–π* transition with the energy of ∼5.0 eV due to the fused benzene ring.33 The other band due to the n–π* transition originates from the surface states with an energy of ∼3.3 eV. Various studies suggest that among various emitting centers, surface related trap states (n–π* transition) dominate the optical properties of carbon dots.36,37 The photophysical properties of carbon dots may open up new opportunities for designing light harvesting systems.
In this study, we have synthesized carbon dot–ZnO NP heterostructures by electrostatic attachment between positively charged carbon dots and negatively charged ZnO NP. Structural characterization has been done by TEM and XPS study. The fundamental photophysical interaction between C-dots and ZnO nanoparticles has been investigated by steady state and time resolved studies. Studies reveal that both electron and hole transfer processes occur in such systems. Analysis suggests that photoinduced electron transfer occurs from carbon dots to ZnO NP and a simultaneous photoinduced hole transfer occurs from ZnO NP to C-dots. Photocurrent generation under solar light irradiation has been investigated which opens up an efficient method for the future construction of photodriven devices.
Experimental section
Materials
Citric acid (Sigma-Aldrich), polyethylenimine, branched (BPEI, Sigma-Aldrich), zinc acetate dihydrate (MERCK India), tetramethylammonium hydroxide (MERCK India), PEDOT:PSS (Sigma-Aldrich), ITO coated glass (Sigma-Aldrich), an aluminum wire (Sigma-Aldrich), ethanol (MERCK Germany), methanol (MERCK Germany) and deionized water (MERCK India) were used to obtain our requirements in the present study.
Synthesis of carbon dots
Synthesis of carbon dots were carried out hydrothermally as reported in our previous study.38 Briefly, 0.1 g of BPEI was dissolved in 10 ml of hot water. 0.1 g of citric acid was added to the aqueous solution of BPEI under vigorous stirring to obtain a homogeneous solution. The solution was then placed in a Teflon lined autoclave and heated at 220 °C temperature for 6 hours. A pale yellow colored solution was obtained after cooling down to room temperature. For the purification, first the solution was centrifuged at 14000 rpm for the removal of larger particles. Then, the centrifuged solution was dialyzed against distilled water using a 2000 MWCO dialysis membrane for the removal of the unreacted precursor and other small molecules. Finally, the pure carbon dot solution was dried for 12 h at 75 °C under high vacuum for further use.
Synthesis of zinc oxide nanoparticles
ZnO nanoparticles were synthesized using a solvothermal method.39 In brief, 1 mmol zinc acetate dihydrate was dissolved in 80 ml of absolute ethanol. After homogeneous dissolution the temperature of the solution was raised to 100 °C. Separately, 10 mmol of tetramethyl ammonium hydroxide (TMOH) was dissolved in 3 ml methanol and dropwise added to the ethanolic solution under vigorous stirring. The solution color turns colorless to white upon gradual addition of TMOH. White ethanolic solutions of ZnO nanoparticles were centrifuged at 10000 rpm for 10 min. The precipitate of ZnO nanoparticles was again dissolved in ethanol and centrifuged. The process was repeated several times to remove the excess precursor. Finally, the solid ZnO was dried and stored for further use.
Carbon dot–zinc oxide nanoparticle composite
ZnO nanoparticles and carbon dots with varying concentration (mg ml−1) ratio were dissolved in absolute ethanol. The solution was then stirred overnight to obtain a composite of C-dot and ZnO. An electrostatic attachment between positively charged carbon dots and negatively charged ZnO NP occurs in ethanol solution. The composite solution was then centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 5 min to remove excess C-dots. A light yellowish solid of the C-dot–ZnO composite was precipitated out. The solid C-dot–ZnO composite was again dissolved in ethanol for all the experiments.
Fabrication of devices
C-dots and ZnO nanoparticles were mixed at a 1:5 weight ratio and stirred for 24 hours for good surface attachment. Then, the composite was centrifuged at 5000 rpm to remove excess C-dots and re-dissolved in ethanol for further experiments. The ITO coated glass was cleaned using soap, ethanol and 1-butanol. Then, PEDOT:PSS was coated on these cleaned ITO glass and dried under vacuum for 30 minutes. The as prepared composite in ethanol was deposited by spin coating at 2000 rpm on these modified ITO glasses. It was then baked under reduced pressure at 100 °C until it was dried. This process was repeated to obtain the desired thickness of the composite. Finally, the Al electrode was deposited according to our previously reported method and the photocurrent of these fabricated devices was measured.40,41
Characterization
The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were taken using a JEOL-TEM 2100 transmission electron microscope with an operating voltage of 200 kV. The crystal structures of the samples were determined by using an X-ray diffractometer (Seifert 3000P) using CuKα radiation (λ = 1.54178 Å). The XPS measurements were carried out using an Omicron Nanotechnology instrument. The DLS and zeta potential were measured by using a zetasizer nanosystem (Malvern Instruments Ltd). Room temperature optical absorption spectra were recorded by using a UV-vis spectrophotometer (SHIMADZU). The PL spectra were recorded using a Fluoromax-P (HORIBA JOBIN YVON) photoluminescence spectrophotometer. For the time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) measurements, the samples were excited at 280 and 375 nm using a picosecond NANO-LED IBH 280L and 370L. The following expression was used to analyze the experimental time resolved fluorescence decays, P(t): (1)Here, n is the number of emissive species and b is the baseline correction (“dc” offset), and αi and τi are the pre-exponential factors and excited state fluorescence lifetimes associated with the ith component, respectively. For multi-exponential decays the average lifetime,〈τ〉, was calculated using the following equation: (2)where  and βi is the contribution of the decay component.
Cyclic voltammetric measurements were done under a nitrogen atmosphere using Ag/Ag+ reference electrode, with a Pt disc as the working electrode and a Pt wire as the auxiliary electrode in a PC-controlled PAR model 273A electrochemistry system. For the measurements of carbon dots, 0.1 M TBAP in THF was used as the electrolyte and 0.1 M KCl in phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) was used for ZnO NP.
Photocurrent measurements were performed with a 300 W Newport Solar Simulator (Newport model 69911 power supply) under 1 sun (AM 1.5 G) illumination at 100 mW cm−2.
Results and discussion
Carbon dots
A TEM image (Fig. 1A) of carbon dots reveals that the as synthesized particles are nearly mono-dispersed in nature. The particle size distribution shows that the carbon dots are ∼4.5 ± 0.5 nm in size (Fig. S1†). Detailed elemental analysis of the carbon dots was carried out by XPS measurements. The XPS spectrum (Fig. 1B) shows three peaks of C 1s at ∼284 eV, N 1s at ∼400 eV and O 1s at ∼530 eV. The XPS study reveals the presence of nitrogen in carbon dots which is consistent with previous results.38 The UV-vis spectrum (Fig. 1C) of the ethanolic solution of carbon dots shows a peak at 343 nm wavelength. The absorption band at 343 nm arises due to the n–π* transition of surface groups.33 The photoluminescence spectrum (Fig. 1C) exhibits an emission band at 437 nm after 365 nm excitation. Time resolved decay times are measured by using TCSPC, with excitation at 375 nm and measured at 437 nm (Fig. 1D). The decay curve follows bi-exponential decay kinetics. The faster component lifetime is found to be 2.65 ns with a contribution of 43%, whereas the slower component lifetime is 8.34 ns with a contribution of 57%. The average decay time of C-dots is 5.88 ns (Table 1). Here, two different lifetime components arise due to two different emissive states. The faster lifetime comes from the conjugated core of carbon dots and the longer lifetime is due to the surface trap states.42 In the present system, the major contribution to the optical behavior originates from the surface states of carbon dots.

Zinc oxide nanoparticles

Fig. 2A presents the TEM image of ZnO nanoparticles. The particle size distribution of ZnO NP shows mono-dispersed nature with a particle size of ∼6 ± 0.5 nm (Fig. S2†). Fig. 2B shows the XRD pattern of ZnO NP. The XRD analysis confirms that the as synthesized nanoparticles correspond to the pure phase of a ZnO wurtzite structure with a hexagonal crystal phase. The XPS spectrum also well supports the formation of ZnO (Fig. S3†). The XPS spectrum shows two peaks at 1020.5 eV and 1043.9 eV that are due to Zn 2p3/2 and Zn 2p1/2.43 The UV-vis spectrum of ZnO NP exhibits a band at 334 nm (Fig. 2C). A sharp absorption peak also depicts the narrow size distribution of ZnO NP. The ZnO NP shows an intense yellow emission at 557 nm (Fig. 2C) dominated by oxygen vacancy defects in ZnO.44,45 Time resolved decay of ZnO NP is depicted in Fig. 2D, measured at the defect emission centered at 557 nm (Table 2). The decay follows the bi-exponential kinetics. The lifetimes of the faster and the slower components are 7.69 ns and 42.99 ns with a contribution of 55% and 45%, respectively, and the average lifetime is found to be 23.74 ns. The visible emissions are still a subject of controversies and several explanations have been proposed. It is said that the photoluminescence lifetime determines the concentration of defects.46 Van Dijken et al. have explained the phenomenon of yellow emission in zinc oxide.47 Such an emission originates due to recombination of a shallow trapped electron with a deeply trapped hole.45 In our system, the longer lifetime component (43.0 ns) arises due to such a recombination through surface defects of O2−/O−. The faster lifetime component of ∼7.7 ns is due to the band gap related exciton recombination.

Carbon dot–zinc oxide (C-dot–ZnO) nanocomposite
The surface charges for carbon dots and zinc oxide nanoparticles are found to be +19.5 and −13.1 mV, respectively, from zeta potential study. Therefore, electrostatic attraction occurs upon the addition of zinc oxide nanoparticles into the ethanolic solution of carbon dots. To confirm the formation of the C-dot–ZnO composite, DLS measurements were carried out (Fig. S4†). The hydrodynamic diameters of carbon dots and ZnO NP are nearly 25 nm and 11 nm, respectively. The hydrodynamic diameter for the composite was found to be around 52 nm, indicating the formation of the C-dot–ZnO composite due to electrostatic attraction. C dot–ZnO NP composite formation was also confirmed by XPS study (Fig. S5†). The XPS spectrum for the composite shows high intense peaks of C 1s, N 1s, O 1s, Zn 2p1/2, and Zn 2p3/2. The highly intense C 1s, N 1s and O 1s peaks are related to C-dots and Zn 2p1/2, Zn 2p3/2 are from ZnO NP in the composite. Analysis reveals the formation of the C-dot–ZnO composite.
Steady state and time resolved spectroscopic studies were carried out to understand the photophysical interaction of the C-dot–ZnO composite system. Both carbon dots and zinc oxide nanoparticles have absorption maxima at ∼340 nm (Fig. 1C and 2C). Photoluminescence quenching was observed for both the peak of C-dots (at 437 nm) and that of ZnO (at 556 nm) upon 340 nm excitation wavelength (Fig. 3). Steady state quenching of both emission bands indicates the possibility of an energy or charge transfer process from both directions.
 Fig. 3  Emission spectra of carbon dots (a), ZnO NP (b) and the C-dot–ZnO composite (c) system. 
To understand this physical phenomenon, two different excitation wavelengths are used for the excitation of the composite, one at 375 nm where C-dots are excited and one at 280 nm to excite ZnO NP. To understand the quenching behavior of carbon dots, all the experiments of the composite system are carried out under 375 nm excitation wavelength. Gradual photoluminescence quenching of carbon dots (concentration 2 μg ml−1) with increasing concentration of ZnO NP (0 to 10 μg ml−1) in the system is observed (Fig. 4A), indicating the energy/charge transfer process. It has to be mentioned that negligible overlap is found between the emission spectrum of carbon dots and the absorption spectrum of ZnO NP (Fig. S6†). The absence of overlap rules out the energy transfer process from C-dots to ZnO NP. A time resolved spectroscopic study is carried out to understand the relaxation dynamics. Fig. 4B presents the time resolved spectra of the C-dot–ZnO NP composite system, studied at 437 nm under 370 nm excitation wavelength. All the decay curves are fitted multi-exponentially. It reveals that the average lifetime of carbon dots gradually decreases from 5.88 ns to 1.82 ns (Table 1) with increasing the ZnO NP concentration in the composite. After a careful analysis of the decay curve, it is seen that a new faster component arises in the C dot–ZnO composite and the faster component lifetime is found to be 270 ps with a contribution of 70%. This faster component is in the picosecond time scale indicating the electron transfer process from C-dots to ZnO nanoparticles which is responsible for the PL quenching. The rate of electron transfer from carbon dots to ZnO NP is found to be 3.7 × 109 s−1.

To understand the actual phenomena of the composite system, the band alignment of the materials was evaluated using cyclic voltammetry (Fig. S7†). The measurements were performed at room temperature under an inert atmosphere using a three electrode system consisting of a Pt wire as the counter and working electrodes and Ag/Ag+ as the reference electrode. The band positions of both C-dots and ZnO NP were obtained from the onset oxidation potential (Eox) and the onset reduction potential (Ered) of nanocrystals using the following equations:48,49 EVB/HOMO = −(Eox + 4.71) eV(3) ECB/LUMO = −(Ered + 4.71) eV(4) EVB/HOMO = ECB/LUMO − ΔE(5)where the potential values are relative to the Ag/Ag+ reference electrode and λ is the wavelength in the absorption spectrum of the CQDs and ZnO NP.
According to the above equations, the valence band (VB) and the conduction band (CB) of ZnO were found to be −7.79 eV and −4.08 eV, respectively (Fig. S7A†). On the other hand the HOMO and LUMO of C-dots were −3.52 eV and −7.13 eV (Fig. S7B†). The band positions of the two nanoparticles are situated in such a manner that the composite of C-dot and ZnO forms a type-II system (Fig. 5). The band position alignment of the two nanomaterials also supports the electron transfer phenomena from C-dots to ZnO NP. Therefore, the excited electron from the LUMO of C-dots is transferred to the conduction band of ZnO NP after excitation at 375 nm, i.e. from the higher energy level (LUMO of C-dot) to the lower energy level (CB of ZnO). Steady state, time resolved spectroscopic study and band position analysis reveal the electron transfer process from C-dots to ZnO NP.
 Fig. 5  Band position alignment for carbon dots and ZnO NP. 
It has already been seen (Fig. 3) that the PL intensity of ZnO NP quenches in the presence of C-dots. To understand such a behavior, we chose the excitation wavelength of 280 nm for the composite to excite ZnO alone. Fig. 6A presents the PL spectra of the C-dot–ZnO composite system under 280 nm excitation wavelength. A gradual PL quenching of ZnO NP (concentration 10 μg ml−1) is observed with increasing concentration of C-dot (0 to 2 μg ml−1) in the composite. A time resolved spectroscopic study was carried out to understand the decay kinetics of ZnO NP in the presence of C-dots. Fig. 6B depicts the time resolved decays of ZnO NP measured at 557 nm under 280 nm excitation wavelength. All the decay curves are fitted bi-exponentially (Table 2). A shortening of the average decay time of ZnO NP from 23.74 ns to 12.78 ns is observed in the presence of C-dots, which justifies the PL quenching of ZnO NP. Analysis of decay time reveals that both the components are changed, especially the faster component changes from 55% to 79% after the addition of C-dots. The change in the faster component indicates the hole transfer process from ZnO to C-dots because the HOMO of C-dots lies between the conduction band edge and the valence band edge of ZnO NP in this type II band alignment system (Fig. 5).50 Holes are generated in the valence band after photoexcitation of ZnO NP, which are eventually transferred from the valence band of ZnO to the HOMO of C-dots. The rate of hole transfer from ZnO NP to carbon dots is found to be 3.6 × 107 s−1. Analysis reveals that the hole transfer process takes place from ZnO NP to C-dots when the composite is excited at 280 nm and this process is responsible for PL quenching of ZnO NP.

An overall representation of the processes occurring in the C-dot–ZnO system is presented schematically in Fig. 7. The figure shows that, due to type II band alignment between carbon dots and ZnO NP, electrons and holes flow in the opposite direction as a result of which charge separation occurs.
 Fig. 7  Schematic representation of the processes. 
To further confirm the electron and hole transfer process i.e. the charge separation process under photoexcitation, we measure the photocurrent of this composite system. Charge transfer or separation at the interface is a fundamental process for light driven devices, which determines the efficiency of light energy conversion across the heterojunctions. Here, heterojunctions facilitate the migration of photoexcited electrons and holes across the interfaces in order to slow down charge recombination and enhance the charge separation process. To obtain direct evidence of the excited state electronic phenomenon of hybrid systems, we have measured photocurrent under illumination of light using a 300 W xenon lamp without any wavelength cut-off filter.
The SEM image of as-prepared fabricated devices of the composite system shows a uniform mono-dispersed morphology (Fig. 8). The typical I–V measurement was carried out with the devices of the pure and composite systems by varying the scanning voltage up to 1 V (Fig. 9). It can be seen that the photocurrent generation is influenced by the thickness of the active materials on devices. When we measured the photocurrent of the device having a thickness of active materials of about 50 nm, there was a high current but the ratio of IL and ID (IL and ID currents in the presence of light and in the absence of light, respectively) is low. If we look at Fig. 9D where the thickness was about 180 nm, the ratio between IL and ID is high (16 fold) but the current is lower compared to other devices. This is because of a high thickness, which inhibits the generation of current. It is noteworthy that the number of excitons generated during light irradiation increases with increasing thickness. Thus, it is expected that with increasing thickness, the photogenerated current should be increased. But in the present study, it is noticed that there is an optimal thickness (∼115 nm) where both the current and the ratio of IL and ID are high (Fig. 9C).

The SEM cross section of devices is given in the ESI (Fig. S8†). Fig. S9† shows the photoresponsive properties of the device and it reveals that the composite is stable under light irradiation. There is no significant increment of current in pure ZnO under light illumination (Fig. S10†). Based on the band alignment of C-dots and ZnO, the photoexcited electron of C-dots is readily injected into the conduction band of ZnO, which is further collected by the Al electrode, and the hole is injected in the reverse direction to the valence band of C-dots, which is collected by the ITO electrode via PEDOT:PSS (Fig. 10).

Conclusions
Herein, we have successfully synthesized carbon dots and a zinc oxide nanoparticle composite system. A composite of C-dots and ZnO NP was designed and its optical behavior was investigated to understand its applicability. Interestingly, a photoinduced electron transfer occurs from the LUMO of C-dots to the conduction band of ZnO NP and a simultaneously photoinduced hole transfer occurs from the valence band of ZnO NP to the HOMO of C-dots. A photoinduced charge separation occurs in the C-dot–ZnO composite system, which is crucial for photocurrent generation. To understand the applicability towards photocurrent generation for the current system, we have constructed a device of the composite. An enhancement (11 fold) of current was found for the composite, which will open up potential strategies for designing light harvesting systems.
