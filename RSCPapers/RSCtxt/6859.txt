        Hydrothermal synthesis utilizing aqueous alkaline reaction conditions was employed for the preparation of TiO2 nanotubes. The ultimate material morphology was found to be extremely sensitive to the nature of the reaction conditions including the chemical nature of the reactor itself—well-defined TiO2 nanotubes were obtained only when the reaction was carried out in a Teflon reactor/autoclave assembly, as ascertained by electron microscopy imaging. In addition, it was shown that the nanomaterial morphology heavily impacted the performance of dye-sensitized photovoltaic devices based on these materials; devices assembled from well-defined TiO2 nanotubes exhibited marked overall improvement in the power conversion efficiency. Several individual experimental parameters including hydrothermal synthesis temperature, film thickness, TiO2 paste composition, and sintering temperature were shown to affect the photovoltaic properties of the resultant solar cells. Upon sensitization with Ru(dcbpyH2)2(NCS)2, optimized devices showed an average power conversion efficiency of 3.76 ± 0.25% under AM1.5G one sun illumination, seemingly limited by low dye surface coverages.

Broader context
Due to their superior charge transport properties, TiO2 nanotubes have attracted significant attention as viable alternatives to mesoscopic materials, particularly in dye-sensitized photovoltaic devices. Hydrothermally prepared TiO2 nanotubes bear significant potential in this regard considering their low production cost and flexible tailoring of their ultimate material properties. Even though many fundamental and technical challenges remain, the present study gleans insight into which individual experimental parameters are crucial for achieving the optimal device performance when nanotube spatial orientations are completely randomized.

Introduction
Over the past two decades significant scientific effort has been invested into a search for reliable renewable energy sources.1 As such various solar energy endeavors are quite attractive as they represent the most abundant, clean, and fully renewable technologies being researched. An emerging photovoltaic technology known as dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) represents one of the most promising candidates for widespread adaptation due to low production cost, robust design, and long term device stability.2–4 To date, the most successful operational devices have employed RuII-based complexes bound to mesoscopic films of TiO2 nanoparticles.5,6 Although record DSSC efficiencies obtained by Gratzel and coworkers have already exceeded 10%,7,8 they still remain well below the theoretical limit of ∼30%.9 Recently, efforts to improve the overall device efficiency have mainly concentrated on the development of more efficient sensitizers,10,11 whereas the importance of semiconductor optimization has not nearly been as intensively investigated. This likely stems from the substantial complexities associated with metal oxide semiconductors in relation to the more straightforward understanding of the molecular behavior. Fortunately, new semiconductor morphologies including nanotube, nanorod, and nanowire topologies have begun to emerge12 through the use of techniques including controlled anodization,13–15atomic layer deposition,16 template-assisted,17–19 and hydrothermal synthesis,20,21 providing access to the fabrication of morphologically diverse TiO2 nanomaterials. The search for alternatives to nanoparticle-based devices was primarily driven by the presumption that oriented nanostructures, as opposed to randomly organized films of sintered nanoparticles, would provide enhanced control over the transport of charge carriers subsequently leading to the suppression of loss pathways and overall improvement of the device performance.12,22–24 In photovoltaic applications, photogenerated electrons collected on the periphery of a nanotube structure may realize the unabated transport to the conductive substrate producing significantly marked improvements in the photocurrent. This concept was partly justified as several studies on ZnO nanotubes have demonstrated that nanotube architecture possessed superior electron transport properties with respect to nanoparticle thin films.25,26 However, this promising technology can still be considered in its infancy as many fundamental and practical challenges remain. Apart from DSSC technology, these emerging semiconductor nanostructures are being increasingly implemented in areas such as water splitting photocatalysis27,28 and chemical sensing.29,30
Despite the success of electrochemical and templating techniques in rendering aligned arrays of semiconductor nanowires and nanotubes, these methods are often energy- and labor-intensive which can potentially impede their large-scale implementation. Furthermore, the successful exploration of the superior charge transport properties of TiO2 nanotubes is still not trivial as many unresolved technical shortcomings exist. In terms of the latter, prototype solar cells based on organized titania nanotubes oriented perpendicularly to the substrate often achieve less than desirable photovoltaic performance and, in many cases, power conversion efficiencies well below 3% have been reported.31–36 This naturally raises a question whether the vectorial nanotube alignment is indeed so critical for efficient photovoltaic cell operation.
The present work demonstrates that desirable electron transport properties of a TiO2 nanotube-based working electrode can in fact be retained even if the nanotubes are not vectorially arranged in any specific manner. Such randomly oriented nanotubular films are relatively inexpensive to fabricate and could be harnessed as an alternative, cost-effective, semiconductor oxide morphology for application in DSSC devices. As a synthetic tool to produce TiO2 nanotubes, we have explored a hydrothermal alkaline route which employs widely available, low cost TiO2 precursors, providing a viable alternative to controlled anodization of Ti metal. In addition, hydrothermally derived materials are advantageous considering that numerous processing parameters can be easily and flexibly tuned37 ultimately leading to the fabrication of dye-sensitized solar cells with optimized photovoltaic characteristics. Even though other related studies have been attempted before,38–41 many fundamental aspects, such as the effects of nanotube preparation conditions, nanotube morphology and assembly, thin film preparation and processing on the device performance, have not been adequately assessed.
From the general prospective, the efficiency of a DSSC device can be controlled by careful tuning and matching photophysical, electrochemical, and chemical properties of its three principal components: the wide band gap semiconductor, dye sensitizer, and electrolyte.42 Considering the enormous complexities present in this research field, all our efforts described herein have been solely directed towards understanding the factors controlling TiO2 nanotube synthesis and their subsequent processing, whereas we used a benchmark dye sensitizer cis-Ru(dcbpyH2)2(NCS)2, widely known as N3,7 and a typical liquid junction electrolyte composition as constants in all solar cell formulations. In the present report, we discuss peculiarities related to the hydrothermal synthesis of TiO2 nanotubes (TNTs) and provide detailed insights into the parameters that control the various properties of the obtained nanomaterial. Furthermore, optimized protocols for the fabrication of reproducible and reasonably efficient dye-sensitized solar cells based on hydrothermally synthesized TiO2 nanotubes are described.
Experimental
Materials and preparation procedures

          TiO2
nanotubes were synthesized hydrothermally according to the following procedure. Typically, 2.0 g of commercially available anatase TiO2 nanoparticles (P25, Degussa) were dispersed in 36 mL of H2O (DIUF grade) under ultrasonication (Branson Sonifier 250) for 10 minutes (2 × 5 minute intervals). NaOH (Sigma-Aldrich) solution was prepared separately (28 g in 36 mL of H2O, DIUF grade). Both solutions were combined in a Teflon reactor (85 mL volume) and stirred at 600 rpm for 10 minutes at room temperature. After that the reaction mixture was placed in a stainless steel autoclave and heated to a specified temperature (130–170 °C) for 24 hours. Under these conditions, an internal pressure of 50 psi was generated during the course of the reaction. After completion, the reaction mixture was cooled down to room temperature and TiO2 nanotube (TNT) crude was obtained as a white gel-like solid. TNTs were separated by centrifugation and then repeatedly washed with 960 mL of 0.1 M HCl followed by washing with 800 mL of H2O (DIUF grade). After the final wash, TNT dispersion was concentrated to dryness on a rotary evaporator (Buchi R-200). The isolated yield of TiO2 nanotubes was >90%. The sample morphology and crystallinity were characterized by Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Raman spectroscopy and X-ray powder diffraction (XRD).

          TNT paste was prepared from the following components: TiO2 nanotubes (12–21 wt%), hydroxypropylcellulose (HPC, 6 wt%), water/acid mixture (∼3/1 volume ratio). In general, dry TNT powder (e.g., 300 mg) was added in small portions to a stirred water/acid mixture (0.85 mL) followed by sonication (VWR, Model 75HT) for 5 minutes after each addition. HPC was added last as an aqueous solution (0.5 mL, 200 mg mL−1). The obtained paste was stirred at 600 rpm overnight.

          TNT thin films were prepared by single doctor-blading of freshly prepared TNT paste on conducting FTO glass. Film thickness was controlled by varying the number of applied Scotch tape layers (2–4). After air drying, TNT films were sintered in oxygen at specified temperature (400–600 °C) for 1 hour (the heat rate was adjusted to 5 °C min−1). Once cooled to 110 °C, TNT films were immersed in 0.5 mM solution of N3 in tert-butyl alcohol/acetonitrile mixture (1/1 volume ratio) for 48 hours at room temperature (see ESI, Fig. S10†). For all photovoltaic measurements, the electrolyte of the following composition was used: 1.0 M LiI, 0.05 M I2, 0.6 M PMII, 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine, 0.1 M guanidine thiocyanate in acetonitrile. Devices were fabricated with Pt/FTO glass as a counter-electrode and Parafilm M as a spacer. The device area was 0.25 cm2 (5 × 5 mm2). The average photovoltaic performance was estimated from parallel measurements of at least three devices.
Characterization techniques
The thicknesses of the TiO2 nanotube films were determined by a KLA-Tencor Alpha-Step IQ Surface Profiler. External quantum yield measurements were carried out using a system from PV Measurements, Inc., equipped with a xenon arc lamp and calibrated with a silicon reference photodiode. Current–voltage characteristics were measured on an I–V data acquisition system (PV Measurements, Inc.) equipped with a small area solar simulator (AM 1.5 Global) and an NREL-certified silicon reference solar cell (PVM 274, NREL) for calibrating the intensity of the solar simulated light to 100 mW cm−2, with the measured current being within 2% of its calibration value. Raman spectra were acquired on a Renishaw inVia Raman Microscope equipped with a 785 nm HPNIR diode laser. SEM images were acquired by an Inspect F (FEI Company) scanning electron microscope. To prepare the SEM sample, a small amount of TiO2 nanotubes was dispersed in water (DIUF grade) by sonication, deposited on a carbon tape substrate, and dried in air, typically overnight. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) measurements were carried out using a JEOL 3011UHR or a JEOL 2010 transmission electron microscope, operated at 300 and 200 kV, respectively. To prepare the TEM samples, a small amount of TiO2 nanotube powder was dispersed in toluene by sonication, dropped onto a carbon-coated copper grid, and allowed to air dry. X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) measurements were carried out on a Scintag XDS-2000 X-ray powder diffractometer.
Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization of TiO2 nanotubes

          TiO2
nanotubes (TNTs) were synthesized from commercially available anatase TiO2 nanoparticles (P25, Degussa) via the adopted literature procedure43,44 with slight modifications (see Experimental section). Briefly, P25 nanoparticles were dispersed in a 10 M NaOH aqueous solution and then allowed to react for 24 hours at a specified temperature (130–170 °C). After cooling to room temperature, the crude reaction mixture was sequentially treated with 0.1 M HCl and deionized water. The as-synthesized nanotubes were characterized by both transmission (TEM) and scanning (SEM) electron microscopy to confirm the morphology while the TNT crystallinity was established by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) and Raman microscopy.
According to the morphological phase diagram of the various titania nanomaterials,44TiO2 nanotubes are expected to be the dominant product of the hydrothermal synthesis under the selected reaction conditions (130–170 °C; 10 M NaOH). As shown in Fig. 1, TEM analysis of several random areas of the TNT sample confirmed the formation of TiO2 nanotubes. The wall thickness of a typical nanotube, estimated from the lattice fringes in high-resolution TEM images (Fig. 1c), was ∼3 to 4 atomic planes, while the TNT diameter averaged to be 8 nm. The distribution of nanotube lengths in investigated samples was fairly disperse ranging from 30 to 150 nm, with a mean value of approximately 100 nm.

However, as partly evident from Fig. 1a and thoroughly demonstrated in Fig. 2, under the employed reaction conditions, the as-synthesized TiO2 nanotubes did not exist as separate entities but instead formed nanotubular bundles that were on average 6–8 µm long and about 100 nm in diameter, as illustrated by SEM imaging of several independent samples.

The crystal structure of as-synthesized TiO2 nanotubes (Fig. 3) appears to be different from that of the starting material (anatase nanoparticles, P25, Degussa) and agrees well with the obtained Raman data (Fig. 4 and S4†), as discussed below. Based on the combined XRD and Raman spectroscopy data, the as-synthesized TiO2 nanotubes cannot be assigned to any particular crystal structure (anatase, rutile, or brukite). However, as discussed later, the crystal structure of TiO2 nanotubes changes as the nanomaterial undergoes the necessary high temperature sintering before device assembly.

A detailed discussion of the nanotube formation mechanism is beyond the scope of the present work, however, it is important to note that well-defined TiO2 nanotube bundles could be readily observed in the crude reaction mixture (see Fig. S1†) indicating that the acid/water post-treatment was not necessary to induce nanotube formation. We note that this experimental observation contradicts one of the existing theories on the mechanism of TiO2 nanotube formation45,46 wherein hydrothermal synthesis is proposed to yield a 2-dimensional layered titanate structure requiring a post-reaction acid treatment to roll them into nanotubes. In the present case, the acid/water post-treatment was utilized to merely remove the excess NaOH and convert the terminal sodium titanate (Ti–O–Na) bonds into their more familiar protonated form (Ti–OH). Consequently, the formation of terminal hydroxyl groups on the semiconductor surface facilitates the strong irreversible bonding with carboxylic groups of RuIIdye sensitizer.
Significance of reaction apparatus
Since the original discovery of hydrothermally synthesized TiO2 nanotubes by Kasuga et al.,47 it has become a common practice to carry out the hydrothermal synthetic procedure in a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave. However, it is not quite obvious why this configuration is required and to the best of our knowledge this issue has not been further clarified in the literature. Notably, TiO2 nanotubes have also been produced using more conventional synthetic apparatus,43,48,49 although the use of Pyrex reactors in the presence of 10 M base at elevated temperatures may adversely affect the desired titania nanomaterial. Working under the assumption that the reaction flask will inevitably impact TiO2 nanotube formation during hydrothermal synthesis, we decided to compare the photovoltaic properties of N3-based dye-sensitized solar cells derived from TiO2 nanomaterials synthesized using identical precursors in three different reactors with otherwise identical conditions. The reactions took place in either a thick walled Pyrex flask, a chemically inert polypropylene (Nalgene) flask, or a polytetrafluoroethylene (Teflon) reactor. In these experiments, the hydrothermal synthesis was carried out with heating provided by an oil bath in the first two instances. The Teflon reactor was placed in a stainless steel autoclave equipped with a thermocouple to facilitate controlled heating.
As shown in Fig. 4, the Raman spectra of the obtained (dry) TiO2 nanomaterials were essentially identical and based on the available literature45,49,50 can be assigned to TiO2 nanotubes. However, these Raman spectra cannot be attributed to any known TiO2 polymorph.51 Judging solely from the side-by-side comparison of the Raman spectra (Fig. 4), the TiO2 nanomaterials produced from these different reactors possess very similar vibrational spectra.
However, the nature of the reaction apparatus profoundly impacts the morphology of the obtained TiO2 nanomaterials. According to SEM, two strikingly different TiO2 morphologies were produced in the reactions (Fig. 5).
 Fig. 5  
            Scanning electron micrographs of TiO2 nanomaterials obtained hydrothermally in different reaction apparatus: (upper image) glass or Nalgene flask/oil bath; (lower image) Teflon reactor/stainless steel autoclave. All hydrothermal reactions were maintained at 130 °C. 
When the hydrothermal synthesis was performed in a glass (Pyrex) and/or a polypropylene (Nalgene) flask, the resulting nanomaterial did not have any particular well-defined morphology (Fig. 5, upper image). On the other hand, carrying out the reaction in a Teflon reactor/autoclave assembly resulted in the formation of morphologically well-defined TiO2 nanotube bundles (Fig. 5, lower image). As the reagents were precisely the same in all instances, this astounding difference in the nanomaterial morphology cannot be logically traced to anything but to the reaction apparatus itself. To the best of our knowledge, this appears to be the first documented example of such a phenomenon in this class of materials.
Furthermore, the dramatic morphological discrepancy directly translated into a huge variation of the photovoltaic performance of N3-based solar cells produced from the corresponding TiO2 nanomaterials. As demonstrated in Fig. 6, under identical experimental conditions, solar cells fabricated from well-defined TiO2 nanotubes strongly outperformed its “isotropic” counterparts. We also note that TiO2 nanomaterials obtained in either glass or Nalgene reactors produced statistically identical, poor-quality solar cell devices.

Apparently, well-defined nanotubes obtained after the hydrothermal reaction in a Teflon/autoclave assembly showed a dramatic 10-fold increase in the external quantum efficiency (EQE), from 2.4 ± 0.7 to 24.6 ± 1.5% as measured at λmax, indicating a much more efficient generation of photocurrent. I–V measurements confirmed the observed trend—while the open-circuit voltage (VOC) was nearly the same (0.651 ± 0.015 vs. 0.640 ± 0.07 V), the devices based on well-defined TiO2 nanotubes generated ∼4.5 times more photocurrent, 5.88 ± 0.04 vs. 1.32 ± 0.32 mA cm−2 (Table 1). As a result, the overall power conversion efficiency (η) was enhanced by more than 300%, 2.24 ± 0.05 versus 0.53 ± 0.07% (Table 1), a rather substantive effect.

It is possible to rationalize why hydrothermal synthesis failed to produce TiO2 nanotubes when the glass reactor flask was used. In the presence of concentrated NaOH at temperatures above 100 °C, it is quite possible that the reaction of glass with the base either effectively competed with or even inhibited nanotube formation. On the other hand, carrying out the hydrothermal synthesis in the Nalgene flask or Teflon reactor should have produced similar experimental results, contrary to what was experimentally observed. Even though the Nalgene flask and Teflon reactor are both chemically inert, the nature of the surface polymer obviously affected the TiO2 nanomaterial morphology and only the latter successfully yielded morphologically well-defined TiO2 nanotubes. The exact origin of these observations still remains poorly understood. However, it is now clear that the reaction apparatus is a crucial component in titania nanotube formation and this work champions the exclusive use of Teflon. In view of the observed phenomena, it is important to emphasize that one must exercise caution while assigning the vibrational spectra to a particular TiO2 morphology and it is imperative to use spectroscopic techniques such as Raman in combination with imaging tools (SEM/TEM/AFM) for a thorough characterization of the obtained nanomaterials.
Effect of reaction temperature
From the fundamental point of view, it is important to know how nanomaterial properties of interest (e.g., photovoltaic response) are affected by the preparation (synthetic) conditions and whether these properties can be subsequently tailored in a desired manner. As was extensively discussed in the literature,37,52 numerous reaction parameters, e.g., temperature, pressure, reactant ratio, and post-treatment procedure, can strongly affect the properties of the obtained TiO2 nanotubes, such as wall thickness, porosity, surface area, etc. As a result, one would expect that nanotubes exhibiting intrinsically different properties would also modulate the photovoltaic performance of their respective solar cells.
Amongst variable experimental parameters, the reaction temperature is one of the easiest to control. Although the formation of TiO2 nanotubes was reported to occur at temperatures below 100 °C,53 higher temperatures are most commonly employed.37,44 Meanwhile, to the best of our knowledge, no comparative study regarding the effect of the reaction temperature on the photovoltaic performance of TiO2 nanotube-based solar cells has been performed to date. In order to address this issue, TiO2 nanotubes were synthesized in a Teflon reactor/stainless steel autoclave assembly at 130 °C (TNT-130C), 150 °C (TNT-150C), and 170 °C (TNT-170C), respectively. As presented in Fig. 7, well-defined TiO2 nanotube bundles were formed for all specified reaction temperatures. In terms of morphology and physical dimensions, each sample is largely indistinguishable based upon side-by-side SEM comparisons. In addition, the Raman spectra of as-synthesized TiO2 nanotubes were nearly superimposable (Fig. S4†) which agrees well with established literature data.45 The only obvious difference was the reduction of the average peak bandwidth when the reaction temperature exceeded 150 °C which may indicate a somewhat higher degree of crystallinity for both TNT-150C and TNT-170C, as compared to TNT-130C.
 Fig. 7  
            Scanning electron micrographs of TiO2 nanotube bundles synthesized at different hydrothermal reaction temperatures: 130 °C (upper image), 150 °C (middle image), and 170 °C (lower image). 
In order to compare the photovoltaic performance of solar cells based on different TiO2 nanotubes, both TiO2 nanotube-containing pastes and films were prepared following identical procedures. The dye coverage for all three samples was estimated to be approximately the same by measuring the absorption spectra of the N3 soaking solution before and after the TNT film sensitization. As shown in Fig. 8, dye-sensitized solar cells fabricated from different samples of TiO2 nanotubes (TNT-130C, TNT-150C, and TNT-170C) with N3 exhibit significant differences in their photovoltaic properties. Overall, devices based on TNT-130C exhibited the best performance with an average power conversion efficiency (η) of 2.81 ± 0.03% (Table 2). Solar cells based on TNT-150C generated slightly inferior performance (η = 2.46 ± 0.08%) with respect to TNT-130C, Table 2. Quite surprisingly, solar cells based on TNT-170C displayed a marked reduction in the photovoltaic response, generating only 1.55 ± 0.07% power conversion efficiency under AM1.5G excitation conditions. Although TNT-170C displayed the highest open-circuit voltage (VOC = 0.708 ± 0.01 V) of all three devices, both the external quantum efficiency (EQE = 21.6 ± 1.8%) and photocurrent density (JSC = 3.50 ± 0.25 mA cm−2) were significantly lower with respect to the other samples.

As discussed below, the apparent discrepancy in photovoltaic performance could not be directly assigned to the intrinsic differences between TNT-130C, TNT-150C, and TNT-170C samples, as several effects associated with thin film processing, especially those occurring during film sintering, have been found to significantly modulate the photovoltaic device efficiency. To understand how different temperatures affect charge-transport characteristics of the current TNT films, we further explored the sintering process of our samples. In general, sintering is commonly applied to thin TiO2 films to burn out the remaining organic components and to induce the higher titania nanomaterial crystallinity. However, as we discovered, high temperature sintering induced significant morphological changes to the initial TiO2 nanotubes. Similar nanoscale transformational effects have also been observed in some other instances.54 As shown in Fig. 9, the most drastic morphological changes occurred to TiO2 nanotubes that were synthesized at 130 °C. Apparently, upon sintering at 550 °C for 1 hour, TNT-130C's were completely converted into mesoscopic nanoparticle-like structures. Due to this transformation, the final TNT-130C-based solar cell device could no longer be considered as nanotube-based in nature. On the other hand, TiO2 nanotubes synthesized at higher temperatures (TNT-150C and TNT-170C) retained their tubular morphology post-sintering. The only apparent change induced by sintering was the splitting of the long nanotube bundles (6–8 µm) into shorter ones (∼2 µm long). Since TNT-150C-based solar cells proved to be reproducibly more efficient than those derived from TNT-170C (Table 2), only TNT-150C-based devices were selected for additional studies. Another significant detail is that synchronous with the induced morphological changes, all of the hydrothermally synthesized TiO2 nanotubes converted into crystalline (anatase) materials after sintering. This particular result will be discussed in more detail below.

Tuning the photovoltaic properties of TiO2 nanotube-based solar cells
In most cases, having access to a semiconductor nanomaterial with well engineered properties is only part of the story and does not always guarantee that the final device will operate as anticipated. It is a common practice to apply various post-synthetic techniques, such as TiCl4 treatment55 or plasma treatment56 to tune the photovoltaic properties of DSSCs in a desired fashion. However, the extent of enhancement realized can vary widely and often depends on the quality of the initial nanomaterial. In some instances, the observed enhancement of device efficiency parameters can be directly correlated to these post-treatment effects and not to the originally synthesized nanomaterial.14 Even though TNT-150C exhibited the best photovoltaic properties in our initial experiments, we decided to independently optimize several other parameters including film thickness, TiO2 content in the paste, sintering temperature, and the specific acid used in paste formulations in order to achieve the maximum photovoltaic performance of TiO2 nanotube-based solar cells. As described in detail in the ESI†, thicker TNT films displayed better photovoltaic performance—increasing the film thickness by a factor of 2, from 12 to 24 µm, resulted in an improvement in the power conversion efficiency by more than 16%. Similar effects were also observed in a number of related studies.15,31,57

          TiO2
nanotube content in the paste
Adjusting the content of TiO2 in the paste is expected to bring about the same effect as increasing the film thickness, i.e. increasing the number of surface-anchored dye molecules directly improves the light-harvesting capacity of the material. As a result, one would expect to see a significant gain in photocurrent due to the increased number of charge carriers. On the other hand, this effect is not easily tractable given the concomitant increase in the bulk resistance and deterioration of the mechanical film durability associated with the composition change. In the present experiments, 18 wt% appears to be the optimal TNT-150C concentration (Fig. 10). As summarized in Table 3, VOC (0.662 ± 0.012 V) maximizes at 15 wt% while the JSC (8.44 ± 0.28 mA cm−2) optimizes at 18 wt%. However, both the EQE (43.1 ± 1.1%) and η (3.18 ± 0.29%) maximize at 18 wt%. The inferior performance of solar cells produced from the paste containing 21 wt% of TNT-150C can be traced to deterioration of the mechanical properties of the TNT films. The obvious thickening of the initial paste led to substantial film cracking during processing and resulted in irreproducible quality in all doctor-bladed films. Fortunately, solar cells fabricated with a TNT-150C content of up to 18 wt% exhibited highly reproducible photovoltaic behavior as presented in Fig. S6†. It is also worth noting that increasing the TNT content in the paste composition increases the final average film thickness; 30 µm thick titania films are routinely generated from the 18 wt% TNT-150C paste.

Film sintering temperature
Apart from optimizing the paste composition, we also questioned how sintering temperature would affect the photovoltaic performance of the fabricated DSSCs. In related previous work,48 the authors noted that higher sintering temperatures led to an enhancement of PV performance. It is widely accepted that higher sintering temperature induces the improved material crystallinity while removing major crystal lattice defects. However, this generic trend is not always universal and optimal sintering temperature is strongly dependent on the nature of the TiO2 nanomaterial. Since every TiO2 polymorph possesses a unique vibrational spectrum,51Raman spectroscopy represents a very powerful tool for monitoring crystallinity changes associated with the sintering process. In the case of hydrothermally synthesized TiO2 nanotubes, the transformation of the as-synthesized amorphous nanotubes into anatase was readily observed at temperatures as low as 400 °C (Fig. S7†). Well-resolved anatase vibrations were present along with several (unassigned) low-intensity peaks occurring in the low-frequency portion of the spectrum (200–300 cm−1). These low-intensity peaks are tentatively assigned to defect sites and, as shown in Fig. 11, gradually disappeared upon increasing the sintering temperature from 450 to 550 °C. TNT films sintered at 550 and 600 °C quantitatively produced identical Raman spectra, an observation that correlates well with the photovoltaic performance metrics of these materials as discussed below.
 Fig. 11  
Raman spectra (λex = 785 nm) of TiO2 nanotubes (TNT-150C) sintered for 1 hour at each of the temperatures indicated, ranging from 450 to 600 °C. 

XRD measurements confirmed the observed nanotube crystallinity modifications with sintering temperature, Fig. 12, thereby supporting the Raman spectroscopy data. Once sintered (e.g., at 550 °C), TiO2 nanotubes (TNT-150C) exhibited the same diffraction pattern as anatase TiO2 nanoparticles (P25, Degussa) commonly employed as starting material in the hydrothermal synthesis.

As presented in Fig. 13, increasing the sintering temperature does lead to enhancement of the TNT-150C-based DSSC photovoltaic performance. While the VOC was only weakly modulated from 0.633 ± 0.003 to 0.650 ± 0.014 V, a major improvement in the photogenerated current was achieved. Although going from 450 to 550 °C caused a slight deterioration in fill factor (62.6 ± 2.3% vs. 58.1 ± 2.5%, Table 4), the JSC increased by more than 34% thereby increasing the power conversion efficiency from 2.49 ± 0.13 to 3.18 ± 0.29% (Table 4). However, increasing the sintering temperature beyond 550 °C does not lead to further improvement, thereby rendering 550 °C as the optimal sintering temperature for this select material.

It was also important to ensure that the observed behavior was caused purely by sintering temperature and not by any additional morphological changes induced by temperature variation. We therefore monitored the morphology of all sintered TNT films with SEM. As was discussed above, high temperature sintering caused the TNT-150C material to fracture into shorter nanotube bundles; however, at any given temperature (450–600 °C), no visible differences in the final film morphology could be detected by visual inspection (Fig. S8†).
Effect of acid
In most, if not all, TiO2 paste formulations, an acidic environment is essential for the fabrication of efficient light-harvesting devices. The main role of the acid in TiO2 pastes is to lower the semiconductor conduction band (CB) potential, consequently maximizing the driving force for excited state electron injection.58 In the case of RuII-based sensitizers, this leads to favorable electron injection from both singlet and triplet excited states, and quantum efficiencies for electron injection can reach unity.59–61 Increasing the quantum efficiency of electron injection, or, in other words, increasing the concentration of electrons in the conduction band consequently shifts the Fermi level of TiO2 to more negative potentials which in turn produces higher open-circuit voltages which are ultimately limited by the energy difference between the semiconductor Fermi level and the redox mediator (e.g., iodide/triiodide).62,63 In all the experiments described above, glacial acetic acid was used in all of the TNT paste compositions. However, it has been previously reported in several studies64,65 that the nature of the acid used in the paste formulation can also significantly affect the photovoltaic properties of the resultant DSSCs. On the other hand, the observed effects can be quite contradictory and appear to be dependent on the particular system under study. In the present case, we selected three acids (glacial acetic acid, 70% nitric acid, and 37% hydrochloric acid) as components in the paste formulation. To avoid any ambiguity in the observed trends, the final molar concentration of each acid in the TNT paste was adjusted to be the same, 2.2 M.
As presented in Fig. 14, our initial acid choice (CH3COOH) was not optimal. When strong mineral acids (HCl or HNO3) were used instead, the resulting solar cell devices exhibited a significant enhancement in their photovoltaic properties. Compared to the CH3COOH-based TNT paste, substitution with HCl resulted in the improvement of all major photovoltaic characteristics (Table 5), the EQE measured at λmax increased from 43.1 ± 1.1 to 48.4 ± 2.3% (or ∼12%), the VOC was improved by 2.3% from 0.650 ± 0.014 to 0.665 ± 0.023 V, and consistent with EQE increase the JSC was enhanced from 8.44 ± 0.28 to 9.39 ± 0.49 mA cm−2 (or ∼11%). Despite a slight deterioration in the fill factor (54.6 ± 2.1 vs. 58.1 ± 2.5%), the overall power conversion efficiency increased by more than 7%, from 3.18 ± 0.29 to 3.41 ± 0.11%.

However, more enhanced solar cell performance was achieved when nitric acid was used in the TNT paste formulation. Compared to HCl-based devices, substitution with HNO3 resulted in further improvement of all major photovoltaic characteristics (Table 5). The EQE measured at λmax increased from 48.4 ± 2.3 to 50.1 ± 1.4% (or 3.5%), VOC increased from 0.665 ± 0.023 to 0.673 ± 0.017 V (or 1.2%), and JSC was enhanced by 2.2%, from 9.39 ± 0.49 to 9.60 ± 0.27 mA cm−2. Ultimately, the overall power conversion efficiency (η) increased by more than 10%, from 3.41 ± 0.11 to 3.76 ± 0.25%. Compared to the initial CH3COOH-based devices, the observed improvement derived from nitric acid was even more significant as the overall cell efficiency was enhanced by ∼18%. Importantly, changing the nature of acid used in TNT-150C paste preparation did not affect the reproducibility of devices fabricated under identical conditions (Fig. S9†). Unfortunately, at present we cannot provide a plausible explanation for the observed dependence of the photovoltaic performance on the nature of the acid used in the TNT paste preparation. In the available literature,64 it has been postulated that these effects can be related to variations in the semiconductor surface structure; however, they are often quite difficult to detect. One can expect that acid-induced modification of the interface between the semiconductor and the sensitizer will modulate both the thermodynamic and kinetic components of a number of interfacial processes involved in the operational cycle of DSSCs. Detailed experimentation is therefore required to specifically address each of these potentially contributing factors.
As a concluding remark, it is important to mention that even though our best optimized TNT devices exhibited the power conversion efficiency close to 4%, their current limitation appears to be a relatively low dye uptake during the film sensitization step which in turn limits the amount of the photogenerated current and, as a consequence, the ultimate cell efficiency. However, efforts to address this issue are still ongoing. Finally, it is also important to emphasize that although our TiO2 nanotube-based photovoltaic devices are still inferior to the benchmark nanoparticle-based DSSCs with >10% power conversion efficiencies, they would often outperform the similar devices derived from vertically aligned arrays of TiO2 nanotubes, based solely on comparison with the available literature data.
Conclusions
In summary, we have hydrothermally synthesized and characterized a range of TiO2 nanotube materials and successfully applied them in dye-sensitized solar cells. For the first time, we have shown that the TiO2 morphology depends strongly upon the nature of the reaction apparatus. In addition, we have shown that the resultant morphology of the TiO2 nanomaterial determines their respective dye-sensitized photovoltaic properties. We have also demonstrated that careful optimization of various experimental parameters, such as reaction temperature, TiO2 paste composition, film thickness, and crystallinity, can lead to a significant improvement of photovoltaic device properties even without vectorial alignment of TiO2 nanotubes with respect to the conductive glass electrode surface. In our hands, the best average photovoltaic performance of hydrothermally produced titania nanotube-based N3-sensitized solar cells (η = 3.76 ± 0.25%) was achieved when a number of tractable experimental parameters were individually optimized.

Broader context
Due to their superior charge transport properties, TiO2 nanotubes have attracted significant attention as viable alternatives to mesoscopic materials, particularly in dye-sensitized photovoltaic devices. Hydrothermally prepared TiO2 nanotubes bear significant potential in this regard considering their low production cost and flexible tailoring of their ultimate material properties. Even though many fundamental and technical challenges remain, the present study gleans insight into which individual experimental parameters are crucial for achieving the optimal device performance when nanotube spatial orientations are completely randomized.
