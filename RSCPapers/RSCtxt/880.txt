    , Accepted 7th August 2017First published on 7th August 2017AbstractA new visible-light-assisted microbial fuel cell composed of a three-dimensional nitrogen-doped graphene self-standing sponge anode and a photoresponsive cathode has been developed for achieving multiple energy conversion and a higher power output.
Microbial fuel cells (MFCs), which hold great potential for simultaneously fulfilling the requirements of energy regeneration and sewage reuse, are attracting worldwide attention.1,2 Currently, the low output power is still one major issue that restricts the practical application of MFCs. Among numerous factors that affect the performance of MFCs, the construction of the bio-anode and the properties of the cathode are two key parameters.1,3
As for the cathode of MFCs, Pt-free catalysts are widely used for cathodic oxygen reduction because of the low cost and promising practicability. However, they are still suffering from high overpotential.4–6 In this case, electron shuttles of ferricyanide have been added into the cathode chamber for decreasing energy loss in the cathode.1,7 Although substantial progress has been made, most studies have only focused on standalone electrocatalysis. In view of this, photoelectrocatalysis that can take advantage of the free and inexhaustible solar energy begins to be introduced into the MFC cathode. For example, an n-type semiconductor of rutile TiO2 has been introduced as a cathodic catalyst to develop light-assisted MFCs, in which light energy and chemical energy from fuels were coupled and transferred into electrical energy.8 Compared to the n-type semiconductor, the p-type semiconductor is more suitable for serving as a cathodic catalyst, because holes are majority carriers in this material and have a strong tendency to accept electrons from the external circuit.9 Moreover, in the research studies on microbial photoelectrochemical cells for hydrogen production, p-type semiconductors have been found to improve the electron-accepting ability of cathodes through multiple energy conversion routes.10,11 Therefore, the integration of a p-type semiconductor and MFC has promising potential in improving the output performance of MFCs.
Beside the cathode, the anode also affects the performance of MFCs, as it is highly associated with bacterial attachment and extracellular electron transfer (EET). Therefore, it is necessary to simultaneously upgrade the cathode as well as the anode during the fabrication of MFCs for further improving the performance. Recently, three-dimensional (3D) graphene has been proven to be a good candidate for the anode of MFCs, due to its large specific surface area, outstanding electrical conductivity, efficient substrate transport and macroporous structure for bacterial colonization in the electrode interior.12–14 However, similar to other carbon materials, 3D graphene is usually hydrophobic, which would hamper bacterial adhesion and EET between the anode and bacteria.15 One smart way to solve this issue is to dope nitrogen into graphene for the fabrication of nitrogen-doped (N-doped) graphene. Extensive studies have revealed that N-doped graphene possesses excellent hydrophilicity and electrocatalytic activity.16–18 More importantly, compared to the undoped graphene, the N-doped graphene could increase the bacterial adhesion due to the formation of surface nitrogen-containing functional groups.19 Therefore, at the same time of optimizing the cathode, developing 3D N-doped graphene as an anode is believed to further improve the performance of MFCs.
In this study, by considering both the anode engineering and the cathode construction, a new hybrid system, visible-light-assisted MFC (VLA-MFC), was successfully developed, as shown in Scheme 1 and described in Section A (ESI†). In this hybrid system, a novel three-dimensional nitrogen-doped graphene self-standing sponge (3D NG-SS) with a monolithic structure was prepared as an anode. Because of its high electrocatalytic activity and suitable porous structure for microorganism colonization, the fuels were rapidly oxidized by the biocatalyst on the anode. On the other hand, visible-light responsive CuS nanoparticles were synthesized as photosensitizers for the fabrication of the photocathode. Upon visible-light illumination, holes (h+) and electrons (e−) were generated in the p-type CuS photocathode. The photoexcited holes in the valence bands were inclined to combine with the electrons from the anode due to their positive potential, while the photoexcited electrons with a high-energy level in the CuS conduction band could be more easily accepted by K3[Fe(CN)6], thus boosting the cathode reduction reaction. Taken together, unlike the traditional MFC where the electrical energy only originated from the chemical energy in fuels, the proposed VLA-MFC achieved multiple energy conversion, in which chemical energy was converted to electrical energy on the anode and solar energy was simultaneously converted to electrical energy on the photocathode. Therefore, the VLA-MFC possesses great potential to obtain high performance.
 Scheme 1  Schematic mechanism of the visible-light-assisted MFC. 
The crystal structures of the NG-SS and pristine graphene self-standing sponge (G-SS) were determined by XRD (Fig. S2A, ESI†). Unlike GO, where the diffraction peak is around 9.5°,20 these two sponges both display a similar broad peak at 26.5°, which can be assigned to the (002) diffraction of graphene.21 Raman spectra of 3D NG-SS and 3D G-SS both exhibit pronounced D and G bands at about 1333 cm−1 and 1589 cm−1 (Fig. S2B, ESI†). And the intensity ratio of D/G for NG-SS (1.10) is increased compared to that of G-SS (1.01) because of the structural distortion and the edge defects induced by nitrogen doping.18 The structural distortion and the edge defects can enhance the electrocatalytic activity,22 likely contributing to improving the EET between the anode and the bacterial cells. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed to investigate the composition of these two 3D sponges. The XPS survey spectrum shows that the 3D NG-SS contains C, N and O with a N content of 5.04 atomic percentages (at%), while the N1s peak is not found in the XPS survey spectrum of the 3D G-SS (Fig. S2C, ESI†). The high-resolution N1s spectrum can be fitted into three peaks at 398.5 eV, 399.9 eV and 401.0 eV, corresponding to the pyridinic nitrogen, pyrrolic nitrogen and quaternary nitrogen, respectively (Fig. S2D, ESI†).23 These results demonstrate the successful nitrogen doping of graphene nanosheets.
The morphology of the NG-SS was characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The TEM image of the NG-SS confirms that the two-dimensional sheet structure of graphene is well retained after N-doping (Fig. S3, ESI†). From SEM images, it was found that the NG-SS possesses a 3D open interconnected porous structure in all directions with continuous macropores of 5–20 μm in diameter (Fig. 1A and B). The size of these macropores is obviously larger than those of bacterial cells (1–2 μm), which would allow the bacteria to penetrate into the anode interior. To confirm this, the morphology of the anode after the incubation with Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 was also analysed by SEM. As shown in Fig. 1C and D, bacterial cells are found to successfully attach on the inner surface of the 3D NG-SS (red ring). Moreover, the outer surface is found to be almost totally covered by bacterial cells, suggesting the efficient bacteria-hosting ability of 3D NG-SS. As a zeta-potential analysis indicates that the charge of NG-SS is more positive than that of G-SS (Fig. S4A, ESI†), such a good bacteria-hosting ability can be attributed to the enhanced bacterial colonization between the 3D NG-SS electrode and the negatively charged bacteria. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) test (Fig. S4B, ESI†) shows that the 3D NG-SS electrode displays a smaller Rct (114 Ω) than the 3D G-SS electrode (198 Ω) and the commercial graphite rod electrode (235 Ω). This result suggests the feature of high conductivity of 3D NG-SS, which would be beneficial to improve the EET efficiency and the performance of MFC. The effect of N contents in the 3D NG-SS anode on the performance of MFC was also investigated. Based on our investigations, the 3D NG-SS anode with an N content of 5.04 at% obtained the highest output power (Fig. S5–S7, ESI†). Therefore, the 3D NG-SS anode with this optimal N content was selected.

To evaluate the application potential of the 3D NG-SS in the MFC anode, we fabricated classical dual-chamber MFCs using the 3D NG-SS as the anode and the conventional carbon paper (CP) as the cathode. After operation for two weeks, the performances of the MFCs were measured. As illustrated in Fig. 2A, compared to the MFC with a commercial graphite rod anode that only has a maximum power density (Pmax) of 171 ± 8 mW m−2 (curve a), the 3D monolithic anode-equipped MFCs both possess higher Pmax (>1000 mW m−2) because of the 3D open interconnected structure for allowing microbial colonization into the anode interior and facilitating diffusion of the substrate (curves b and c). Especially, the Pmax value of the MFC with the 3D NG-SS anode (1471 ± 5 mW m−2) outperforms that of MFC with the 3D G-SS anode (1051 ± 13 mW m−2) due to the improved bacteria-hosting ability and EET efficiency caused by N-doping. Fig. 2B shows the current generation from MFCs with an external load of 1 kΩ. The 3D NG-SS anode produces an output current of 2.27 A m−2, which is 1.6 and 10.8 times those of the 3D G-SS anode (1.40 A m−2) and the commercial graphite rod anode (0.21 A m−2), respectively. Moreover, the power density of the constructed MFC is also higher or at least comparable to those of recently reported MFCs using 3D carbon-based materials as anodes (Table S1, ESI†). All these results confirm the superiority of the 3D NG-SS anode in MFCs.

P-Type CuS is known for possessing favourable electrical and optical properties, and has been extensively applied in the fields of polymer solar cells, dye-sensitized solar cells, and photocatalysis.24–26 Therefore, in this work CuS was selected as a cathode material for introducing solar energy into 3D NG-SS anode-based MFCs. The XRD pattern (Fig. S8A, ESI†) of the as-prepared product matches well with that of standard CuS (JCPDS No. 06-0464). The SEM image reveals a 3D flower-like structure composed of nano-flakes (Fig. S8B, ESI†), indicating the large specific surface area of CuS. Such an extended specific surface area would facilitate reflection and refraction of light, and thus improving the efficiency of light utilization. The UV-vis absorption spectrum displays a strong and broad absorption in the near-infrared region (inset in Fig. S8B, ESI†), demonstrating the good response of CuS to visible light. The catalytic activity of the CuS photocathode toward the reduction reaction of K3[Fe(CN)6] was explored by a liner scan voltammetry (LSV) analysis. As shown in Fig. 3A, under visible-light illumination, the LSV curve of the CuS photocathode shows a reduction peak of K3[Fe(CN)6] at about 0.1 V (curve c), while no reduction peak is found in the LSV curve of CP (curve a), suggesting that the reduction reaction of K3[Fe(CN)6] is significantly enhanced in the CuS photocathode. Moreover, without visible-light illumination, the peak current of the CuS photocathode is obviously decreased (curve b). Thus, the utilization of the CuS photocathode can effectively introduce light energy for promoting the reduction of the electron acceptor in the cathode. As CuS possesses poor electrical conductivity, the excess CuS content on the photocathode would increase the diffusion resistance and hamper the reduction of the electron acceptor. In view of this, we optimized the CuS content on the photocathode. The reduction current initially increased when the CuS content was increased, and then decreased with a further increase in CuS content (Fig. S9, ESI†). Therefore, the photocathode with a CuS loading content of 0.45 mg cm−2 was chosen for the following experiments.

Given the enhanced ability to promote the reduction of the electron acceptor in the cathode, the CuS photocathode is expected to further improve the performance of the 3D NG-SS anode-based MFC. To confirm this hypothesis, the VLA-MFC was fabricated by using a 3D NG-SS anode and a CuS photocathode. Under the illumination of visible-light, the Pmax value of the VLA-MFC increased from 1890 ± 8 to 2607 mW ± 13 m−2 (curves b and c in Fig. 3B), while the Pmax value of the 3D NG-SS anode-based MFC with a CP cathode almost unchanged (1471 ± 5 vs. 1495 ± 3 mW m−2, curve c in Fig. 2A and curve a in Fig. 3B). These results suggested that the light energy was successfully introduced into the VLA-MFC by using CuS as the cathode material. Compared to the 3D NG-SS anode-based MFC with a CP cathode in the dark (1471 ± 5 mW m−2), the VLA-MFC with visible-light illumination displayed a 77% increase in Pmax (2607 ± 13 mW m−2), which could be attributed to the promoted effect of the CuS photocathode on the reduction of the electron acceptor. Moreover, the Pmax value of the VLA-MFC under visible-light illumination was 14.2 times higher than that of the MFC with a graphite rod anode and a CP cathode (171 ± 10 mW m−2, curve a in Fig. 2A), confirming the synergistic effect between the 3D NG-SS anode and the visible-light responsive CuS photocathode. As summarized in Table S1 (ESI†), the Pmax value of this VLA-MFC is significantly higher than those of recently reported MFCs using 3D graphene-based anodes and traditional cathodes. On the other hand, this value is significantly superior to that of MFC using a rutile photocathode.27
In summary, a new type of VLA-MFC that integrated light energy and chemical energy into electrical energy has been developed. Owing to the multiple energy conversion routes and the synergistic effect between the novel 3D NG-SS anode and the visible-light responsive CuS photocathode, the VLA-MFC obtains a superior power output. Clearly, the development of the new type of VLA-MFC not only brightens up the field of MFCs, but also adds a new dimension to the utilization of solar energy.
