, Accepted 4th November 2014First published on 4th November 2014AbstractThis work describes a cooperative quantum dot and plasmonic effect on improving the performance of dye synthesized solar cells, in which CdS QDs, gold nanoparticles (GNPs), and gold nanorods (GNRs) are incorporated into the active layer. The cooperative nanoparticles show a superior behavior on enhancing light absorption in comparison with single nanoparticles, which led to dye synthesized solar cells with a power conversion efficiency accounting for a 147% enhancement. The cooperative CdS QDs and plasmonic effect arose from the cooperation of the resonance enhancement of QDs and two different nanostructures. Detailed studies shed light into the influence of quantum dots and plasmonic nanostructures on dissociation, exciton generation, and charge transport as well as recombination inside these devices.
1. Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) are currently attracting world-wide scientific and technological interest because of its low cost and simple fabrication process.1–3 Titanium dioxide (TiO2) with a wide band gap (about 3.2 eV), which absorbs the sunlight in the ultraviolet region,4 is one of the most prominent oxide materials for performing various types of industrial applications such as photovoltammetry2 and photocatalysis.5,6 The wide band gap of TiO2 limits its absorption to the ultraviolet region of the solar spectrum.7 In addition, the low electron mobility of TiO2 leads to the inferior conversion efficiency of solar cells.8,9 To date, numerous efforts have been made to develop high performance sensitizers in order to enhance light harvesting in the visible light region.10–13 Although the development of new dyes has led to continued improvements in the efficiencies of DSSCs in recent years,14,15 they are still often limited by the weak absorption of the dye sensitizer. This is exemplified by the commonly used ruthenium(II) polypyridyl dyes (e.g., N719). N719 absorbs strongly at 535 nm, but has drastically reduced extinction coefficients at longer wavelengths.16 Thus, improving the light harvesting efficiency (LHE) in the 300–900 nm wavelength range is considered as a promising approach to increase the power conversion efficiencies (PCE) and photocurrents of these devices.17,18 It is well known that an effective method for trapping light or enhancing light harvesting, to develop high efficiency photovoltaic devices, is using the metallic nanostructures with a high absorption and scattering cross section.19,20 It has been reported that metal nanoparticles, such as gold and silver, can enhance the photo response of photovoltaic devices by acting as light trapping agents,21,22 photosensitizers,23 and electron traps for facilitating charge separation.24,25 The gold and silver nanoparticles have strong absorption in the visible region due to the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) effect associated with the enhancement of an electromagnetic field due to collective electron oscillation.26
Moreover, quantum dot-sensitized solar cells are considered as a promising candidate for the development of next generation solar cells because of the simple and low cost fabrication techniques. Quantum dots (QDs), such as CdS, CdSe, CdTe, and PbS, which absorb light in the visible region, can serve as co-sensitizers because they are able to transfer electrons to the conduction band of TiO2.7 Among these QDs, CdS with suitable band gaps and band positions compared with the conduction band of TiO2 create a long distance charge separated state with electrons and holes at sites far from each other and hence is useful for use in DSSC, in order to improve the energy conversion efficiency of QDSSCs.14,15 However, the relatively low conversion efficiency of such cells is still a primary challenge for the large-scale applications of QDSSCs. QDs in contrast with a narrow absorption spectra, typically exhibited by molecular dyes, have the advantage of a broad absorption spectrum and stretching from the band edge to higher energies. On the other hand, charge collection in QDSSCs has proven to be significantly more difficult, probably due to charge trapping on the QD surfaces and the availability of more recombination sites. Moreover, photochemical reactions, particularly with a liquid electrolyte, can induce significant degradation of the QD sensitizers. A detailed account of these can be found in two recent review articles.27,28
Here we report the cooperative PCE enhancement of 147% by adding CdS QDs, Au nanoparticles and nanorod mixture into a photoanode.
We present a design that combines the benefits of QDs in terms of their broad absorption spectrum and the light harvesting efficiency (LHE) of noble metals with the evolved charge transfer mechanism of DSSC. In this design, QDs show significant absorption between 200–300 nm; N719 dye molecules show absorption in 313 nm and 500–560 nm region, and gold nanoparticles and nanorods have absorption in 450–600 and 450–900 nm region. As schematically shown in Fig. 1, this new design almost covers the entire UV-Vis region.

Finally, the effect of cooperation between the gold nanoparticles (GNPs) and gold nanorods (GNRs), QDs and GNPs, as well as QDs and GNRs on lifetime, photocurrent, and collection charge were studied.
2. Experimental
Synthesis of CdS QDs
CdS QDs were prepared by the reaction of cadmium oxalate with thioacetamide (TAA) in a mixture of water, ethanol and propylene glycol (PG) as solvent under magnetic stirring at 45 °C. Here, CdS QDs were prepared with a very simple method at 45 °C for the first time.
Synthesis of the gold nanoparticles
For the synthesis of the gold nanoparticles, seeds were prepared by the reduction of HAuCl4 by NaBH4 in the presence of CTAB as follows: 3.75 mL of 0.2 M CTAB was added to 1.25 mL of 1 mM solution of HAuCl4. Next, 300 μL of 0.01 M of fresh cooled NaBH4 solution was added to the solution. The solution became pale brown, which indicates the formation of 4 nm nanospheres. The size of the nanoparticles were verified by UV (Shimadzu, model UV-3101) and XRD (Rigaku D-max C III) analysis.
Synthesis of the gold nanorods
The synthesis of the gold nanorods was performed, according to the protocol introduced by B. Nikoobakht et al. via the seed mediated method. To prepare the GNRs, 300 μL ascorbic acid (0.01 M) was added to the growth solution consisting of 0.01 mL of 2.5 mM HAuCl4, 5 mL of 0.1 M CTAB and 50 μL AgNO3 0.01 M to change the color from pale yellow to a colorless solution. Subsequently, 50 μL of freshly prepared seeds were added while the solution was mixed gently. The solution remained undisturbed for 12 h and was characterized via UV-Vis spectroscopy.
The electrophoretic deposition (EPD) method was utilized to prepare the P25 NPs-based films used in the DSSCs. During the electrophoretic deposition, the cleaned FTO glass remained at a positive potential, the anode, and a pure steel mesh was used as the cathode electrode. The distance between the two electrodes was about 2 cm. Power was supplied by a Megatek Pro-grammable DC Power Supply (MP-3005D, MEGATEK). The applied voltage was 10 V. The deposition cycle was 4 and 8 times, each with a time of 15 s. The coated substrates were dried at 150 °C. The active area of the working electrode was 1 × 1 cm2. The resulting layer was annealed under an air flow at 500 °C for 60 min. Based on other experiments previously reported,29 electrolyte solution and the amount of additives are important for the creation of a high quality surface. The thicknesses of these electrodes were about 12 μm (Scheme 1). We used optimal concentrations of additives in the electrolyte solution as follows: I2 6 mg L−1, acetone 0.4 mL L−1, and water 1 mL L−1.

The electrodes, which were prepared with EPD, were immersed in a 0.2 M colloidal solution of the GNPs for 2 min before drying at 100 °C. The same process was used to deposit the GNRs (0.2 M colloidal solution) and CdS QDs. But in the case of cooperation between the GNPs and GNRs, the immersion in QDs solution was omitted.
Cell assembly
The fabricated electrodes were separately immersed into a cis-di(thiocyanato)-N,N′-bis(2,20-bipyridyl-4-carboxylic acid-40-tetrabutylammonium carboxylate) ruthenium(II) (N-719) (Dyesol) dye solution in ethanol (0.5 mM) and maintained at 48 °C for 24 h to complete the sensitizer uptake. The dye-adsorbed TiO2 electrodes were then rinsed with acetonitrile and dried.
A Pt coated FTO glass was prepared as a counter electrode. The Pt electrode was placed over the dye-adsorbed TiO2 electrode and the edges of the cell were sealed with a sealing sheet (Surlyn 50, Dyesol). Sealing was accomplished by pressing the two electrodes together on a double hot-plate at a temperature of about 120 °C. The Co3+/Co2+-electrolyte (Dyesol) was introduced into the cell through one of two small holes drilled in the counter electrode. Finally, these two holes were sealed by a small square of sealing sheet. Subsequently, DSSCs were characterized by I–V (solar simulator – Luzchem Research, Inc, IVIUMSTAT – Ivium Technologies), IMVS (IVIUM MODULIGHT MODULE – Ivium Technologies), IMPS (IVIUM MODULIGHT MODULE – Ivium Technologies) and EIS (IVIUMSTAT) spectra.
3. Results and discussion
We present a simple and new method for the synthesis of CdS QDs. CdS QDs were prepared by the co-precipitation method, in which a mixture of water, propylene glycol, and ethanol were used in a ratio of 10:1:1 as the solvent at 40–50 °C. 0.23 g cadmium oxalate was dissolved in 100 cc distilled water, 10 mL PG, and 10 mL ethanol under magnetic stirring at 45 °C. Then, 0.26 g thioacetamide was added. Finally, NaOH (0.17 g in 80 mL H2O) was added to the abovementioned solution. As shown in Fig. 2a, the QDs were synthesized with no impurities. Fig. 2b shows the HRTEM images (Philips EM208S transmission electron microscope with an accelerating voltage of 100 kV).

Fig. 3a shows the UV-Vis spectra of the as-synthesized CdS QDs. The CdS QDs show a strong absorption at 260–400 nm. The temperature and rate of PG, water, and ethanol are the key factors for the preparation of the CdS QDs. Fig. 3b and c show the UV-Vis spectra of the GNPs and GNRs.

To clarify the effect of the CdS QDs/GNPs/GNRs in DSCs, we first optimized device performance and then investigated their cooperative effect on DSCs performance on a case by case basis. Solar cells with the structure of FTO/TiO2/M/FTO (M = CdS QDs, GNPs, and GNRs) were fabricated and measured under AM 1.5 illumination at 100 mW cm−2. The corresponding current density versus voltage (J–V) curve and details of the DSCs based on GNPs, QDs, GNPs and GNRs, QDs and GNRs, QDs, GNPs and GNRs are reported in Fig. 4 and Table 1. It should be noted that according to the previous reports, the Jsc of devices based on N719 and cobalt complexes is low.30–32

After incorporating CdS QDs into the TiO2 layer, open-circuit voltage (Voc) remained nearly the same, short-circuit current density (Jsc) increased from 2.16 to 2.8 mA cm−2 and FF increased from 55% to 59%. The incorporation of gold nanoparticles and nanorods into the TiO2 layer shows similar improvement. The Voc remained almost unchanged, and the Jsc improved to 2.6 mA cm−2 and 3.45 mA cm−2.
The cooperation effect of (CdS QDs with GNPs), (CdS QDs with GNRs), (GNPs with GNRs), (CdS QDs/GNPs with GNRs) by simply mixing them in optimized conditions together into the TiO2 layer were investigated. Very interestingly, devices with CdS QDs/GNPs/GNRs showed a considerably better solar cell performance, and the Jsc was enhanced to 7.7 mA cm−2. The average solar cell parameters over 18 identical devices are summarized in Table 1.
Typically, solar cells with the CdS QDs/GNPs/GNRs showed a mean Voc at 0.66 ± 0.01 V and Jsc at 7.7 ± 0.18 mA cm−2. The small standard deviations indicate the good reliability and reproducibility of our results.
It is necessary to investigate electrochemical properties by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) to elucidate the interfacial charge transfer processes in the devices.33–36 Fig. 5 demonstrates typical Nyquist plots of the DSSCs with bare TiO2 and cells containing QDs, GNPs, GNRs and their cooperative influence.

With increasing frequency, two semicircles are observed in the Nyquist plots. The first semicircle is attributed to the charge transfer resistance between platinum counter electrode and redox couple (RCE). In the middle frequency region, the second semicircle reflecting the charge transfer resistance at the dyed-TiO2/electrolyte interface is related to charge recombination process (RCT) and can be expressed by eqn (1):33–37 
RCT = R0exp[−βV/(kBT)] = R0exp[−βV/(kBT)(EF − Eredox)]
(1)where R0 is a constant and also β is a constant that is called the transfer coefficient. Due to the same amount of capacitances for counter electrode/redox couple and dyed-TiO2/electrolyte interface, the two semicircles are hardly recognizable. T and kB represent absolute temperature and the Boltzmann constant, respectively. EF is the Fermi level of the TiO2 semiconductor and Eredox is the energy of the Co2+/Co3+ redox couple in the electrolyte. The impedance spectra of these devices with the best energy conversion efficiency were investigated. The impedance spectra were fitted to a simplified version of the equivalent circuit (Fig. 5). Some important parameters of the working electrodes in these devices were determined from the second semicircles and are summarized in Fig. 5 and Table 2. The effective diffusion coefficient of the electrons (Deff) can be determined by eqn (2): 
Deff = [RCT/RCE]L2Keff
(2)Here, Keff is the reaction rate constant for the electron recombination with Co3+ and L is film thickness. Keff is obtained by the electron lifetime (τ) and angular frequency (ωmax) at the second semicircles in the Nyquist plots of the dye synthesized solar cells (eqn (3) and (4)):33 
τ = 1/ωmax

Keff = 1/τ

There is small difference between these devices for the RCE at the counter electrode/electrolyte interface. These results show that the CdS QDs, GNPs, and GNRs do not increase the residence of counter electrode. Notably, the fitted value of RCT for the cell containing the CdS QDs, GNPs, and GNRs is found to be ∼160 Ω cm2, whereas the corresponding value for reference cell is ∼70 Ω cm2.
This significant increase in the RCT shows that the CdS QDs, GNPs, and GNRs are more favorable to suppress the charge recombination process that arises from electrons in the TiO2 film with Co2+ in the electrolyte solution, which leads to an increase in Jsc.38 On the other hand, the adsorption of CdS QDs, GNPs, and GNRs on the TiO2 surface causes an increase in the electron density in the conduction band of TiO2. In the cell based on the CdS QDs, GNPs, and GNRs, the middle-frequency peak in the Nyquist plot shifts to a lower frequency relative to the reference device, exhibiting a longer electron lifetime for these cells.
IPCE was used for explaining the improved PCEs. Fig. 6 shows the IPCE spectra of the TiO2/N719-only DSCs and TiO2/N719/CdS/QDs/GNPs/GNRs. It is indicated that the IPCE of the TiO2/N719/CdS/QDs/GNPs/GNRs enhanced DSCs is increased over the entire wavelength range, particularly within 400–700 nm, compared with that of the TiO2/N719-only DSCs. The IPCE is related with the light-harvesting efficiency, electron injection efficiency, and carrier collection efficiency simultaneously. Assuming that the electron injection and collection are seldom affected, the increase of the IPCE should be attributed to the light harvesting enhancement due to the CdS QDs, GNPs, and GNRs. The IPCE ratio of the TiO2/N719/CdS/QDs/GNPs/GNRs enhanced DSCs to the TiO2/N719-only DSCs, shown in Fig. 6b, which illustrates that the enhancement is significant in the range of 400–700 nm.

UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) of the electrodes with and without the nanostructures were performed to better understand the Jsc enhancement. The absorption spectrum is shown in Fig. 7.
 Fig. 7  UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) spectra of the electrodes. 
We can argue that the absorption of the DSCs in the region of 260–400 nm is enhanced after the incorporation of the CdS QDs (Fig. 7c); further incorporation of GNPs and GNRs improved the absorption from 450 to 850 nm (Fig. 7b). It is clear from UV-Vis absorption spectra that cooperation among CdS QDs/GNPs/GNRs shows a broader absorption enhancement region (Fig. 7f). The enhanced absorption is in good agreement with the J–V result, shown in Fig. 4. On the basis of the UV-Vis absorption results, it is clear that the CdS QDs/GNPs/GNRs greatly broaden the wavelength range for absorption enhancement compared with GNPs or GNRs or CdS QDs.
Intensity modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS)39,40 and intensity modulated photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS)9 were used to measure the respective time constants for the combined processes of charge collection and charge recombination at a short circuit and charge recombination at an open circuit and in the dye-sensitized solar cells. If charge collection is considerably faster than charge recombination, then the charge-collection efficiency will be high because the electrons are collected before they have time to recombine.
It is assumed that the loss of injected electrons via both photocurrent and recombination are proportional to the electron concentration in TiO2 and the rate constants for these processes are independent of each other.41 The time constant for charge recombination at the open circuit (τr) was obtained from IMVS. The collection (transport) time (τc) can be estimated from the equation τr = 1/2πfc, where fc is the characteristic frequency maximum of the IMPS imaginary component, and the charge-collection efficiency ηcc is given by the equation ηcc = 1 − (τc/τr). For the IMVS and IMPS measurements, the DSSCs were probed with a modulated beam of 470 nm.
The effect of CdS QDs, GNPs, and GNRs on transport, recombination times, and charge-collection efficiency are presented in Table 3. It is clear that devices based on CdS QDs, GNPs, and GNRs show a higher collection time and charge-collection efficiency.

4. Conclusion
To conclude, we improved the PCEs and charge-collection efficiency of DSCs by incorporating QDs and metal NPs into the TiO2 layer. LSPR induced local field enhancement not only leads to increased light absorption of the active layer materials of DSCs but also benefits charge separation and transport, resulting in an increased lifetime and charge carrier density. Moreover, we also showed that cooperative plasmonic enhancement could be achieved by simply combining CdS QDs, GNPs, and GNRs into the TiO2 layer. The LSPR and QDs absorption lead to the enhancement of the light absorption region after the combination; this idea is further proven by the solar cell performance of the devices with separate CdS, Au nanoparticles and nanorods. We believe that the results of our study offer an effective approach to enhance the efficiency of dye synthesized solar cells.
