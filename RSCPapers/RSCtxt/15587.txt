Introduction
With the consumption of fossil fuels, the problem of global warming caused by the increase in the atmospheric concentration of CO2 has raised public concern and research attention. One of the best solutions to this issue is to convert CO2 into renewable fuel by photocatalytic reduction, which can both reduce the concentration of CO2 and relieve the shortage of energy. Extensive attempts have been made for the exploration of high-efficiency photocatalytic systems for CO2 photoreduction. Mimicking natural photosynthesis in green plants, consisting of photosystem II (PS II) and photosystem I (PS I), Z-scheme systems driven by a two-step photoexcitation using two different semiconductor photocatalysts and a redox mediator, have been well developed since Bard introduced the concept of Z-scheme water splitting in 1979.1 The principal advantage of the Z-scheme lies in the availability of the strongly reductive electrons of one photocatalyst and the strongly oxidative holes of the other.2 The electron mediator plays an important role in charge transfer between an oxidation-evolving photocatalyst to a reduction-evolving photocatalyst in Z-scheme systems. The traditional electron mediators include redox ionic couples, e.g. Fe3+/Fe2+ or IO3−/I−, and [Co(bpy)3]3+/2+/[Co(phen)3]3+/2+.3 However, this kind of Z-scheme system are of several negative effects, such as back reactions for water splitting reaction, strongly visible light absorption of these redox mediators, and operatability only in solution systems.4
In recent years, so-called all-solid-state Z-scheme systems using solid conductive medium as redox mediators have been constructed and widely utilized for water splitting4b,5 and CO2 photoreduction.2c,3g Tada and co-workers achieved a CdS/Au/TiO2 Z-scheme for visible-light-induced efficient artificial photosynthetic systems, in which Au as the electron conductor vectorially transfers the photogenerated electrons from the conduction band (CB) of TiO2 to the valence band (VB) of CdS.5a Considering high cost of Au (ref. 6) or other noble-metals,7 it is desirable to develop affordable alternative electron mediators. Graphene-matriced photocatalysts show remarkable photochemical and photoelectrochemical performance, due to the unique properties of graphene. Amal et al. coupled reduced graphene oxide (rGO) with H2-evolving photocatalyst (Ru/SrTiO3:Rh) and an O2-evolving photocatalyst (BiVO4) for increasing photocatalytic activity,5b first proving that rGO could be an excellent solid state electron mediator for Z-scheme.2c,4b,8
In this paper, we construct an all-solid-state Z-scheme consisting of CdS nanospheres (CdS NSs) and TiO2 nanoparticles as photocatalysts, and rGO as solid electron mediator for photocatalytic reduction of CO2 in the presence of water vapor. In this Z-scheme system, the photogenerated electrons from CB of TiO2 transfer to rGO, and then recombine with existing holes of CdS NSs, allowing that the photogenerated electrons enrich on the CdS semiconductor and holes on TiO2 for reduction of CO2 and oxidation of H2O, respectively. Advantageous over expensive Au mediator, the cheap and easily available rGO with high electrical conductivity not only facilitates the transfer of charge carriers, but also the characteristic of a large specific surface area and 2D structure is favorable for supporting the TiO2–CdS heterostructure with a good interface contact. The present work may provide a promising possibility of low-cost fabrication of complex Z-scheme systems for high-efficiency artificial photosynthesis.
Experimental section
Preparation of CdS NSs/rGO/TiO2 Z-scheme system
Uniform CdS NSs were prepared by a simple hydrothermal method. In a typical synthesis, 0.5 mmol of cadmium acetate dehydrate [Cd(CH3COO)2·2H2O] and 0.5 mmol of thiourea (NH2CSNH2) were dissolved in 30 ml of deionized water containing 0.15 g of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP). After stirring for 30 min at room temperature, the solution was transferred into a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave with 50 ml capacity and maintained at 120 °C for 20 h. The final products was separated and collected by centrifugation and washed several times with deionized water and dried by lyophilization.
CdS NSs/GO nanocomposites were obtained via electrostatic self-assembly.9 250 mg of CdS NSs and 0.5 g of polyethylenimine (PEI) were dispersed in 200 ml of deionized water at pH 9.0 under stirring to introduce positive charges to the surface of CdS NSs. The pH was adjusted by dilute hydrochloric acid or ammonia solutions. Then, the suspension was ultrasonically treated for 10 min. After further stirring for another 15 min, the PEI-coated CdS NSs was collected by centrifugation and washed several times to remove excess PEI. Afterward, the PEI-coated CdS NSs was dispersed in 200 ml of deionized water at pH 9.0. After another ultrasonic treatment, the colloidal suspension of negatively charged GO nanosheets at pH 9.0 was added drop wise to the suspension under stirring until the resultant products were sedimented due to the electrostatic attraction between the GO and CdS NSs. Finally, a centrifugation and washing process was carried out several times to remove the excess reactants and the final products were dried by lyophilization.
CdS NSs/rGO/TiO2 were prepared via the versatile kinetics-controlled coating method.10 100 mg of CdS NSs/GO nanocomposites were dispersed in 100 ml of absolute ethanol. 0.3 ml of concentrated ammonia solution was added dropwise to the solution. 0.5 ml of tetrabutyltitanate was added dropwise to the solution after ultrasonic treatment for 15 min, and then the reaction was allowed to proceed for 8 h at 50 °C under stirring. The resultant products were separated and collected by centrifugation and washed with deionized water and ethanol for 3 times. After drying, the resulting samples were calcined at 400 °C in nitrogen atmosphere for 2 h to remove the PEI and reduce the GO to rGO.
Materials characterization
The morphology of as-prepared samples was characterized by the field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) (FEI NOVA NanoSEM230, USA) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (JEOL 3010, Japan). The crystallographic phase of these obtained products was determined by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) with Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 0.154178 nm) (Rigaku Ultima III, Japan). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (K-Alpha, THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC) measurements were calibrated with respect to the binding energy of the adventitious C 1s peak at 284.5 eV. The UV-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectrum was measured on a UV-vis spectrophotometer (UV-2550, Shimadzu) at room temperature. The transient time-resolved photoluminescence decay measurements were recorded on a fluorescence spectrometer (FLS920, Edinburgh Instruments).
Measurement of photocatalytic activity
In the photocatalytic reduction of CO2, a 300 W xenon arc lamp was used as the light source at a distance of about 10 cm with cooling water and no other filters placed between the lamp and samples and the input optical power is approximately 50 W. The gas-tight reaction system had a volume of about 230 ml and was vacuum-treated several times (Fig. S1†). Then, high purity of CO2 gas was injected into the reaction system for reaching ambient pressure. 0.4 ml of deionized water was injected into the reaction system. The gases were stored in the dark for several hours to reach the equilibrium of the CO2 and H2O and ensure that the adsorption of gas molecules was complete. During irradiation, about 1 ml of gas was continually taken from the reaction cell at given time intervals for subsequent CH4 concentration analysis by using a gas chromatograph (GC-2014, Shimadzu Corp., Japan). The gas amount of O2 from CO2 reduction was determined using gas chromatography (GC-8A, MS-5A column, TCD, Ar carrier).
Results and discussion
The fabrication process of unique CdS NSs/rGO/TiO2 Z-scheme system was described as following. The negative charged GO nanosheets were firstly absorbed onto the positive charged surface of CdS NSs via an electrostatic absorption method. TiO2 precursor was then coated on the GO nanosheets to form the CdS NSs/GO/TiO2 core–shell nanostructure. The subsequent thermal treatment in N2 gas inert atmosphere allows transfer of GO into rGO, crystallization of TiO2, and removal of involved organic moiety. Mat like rGO acts as a low-resistance charge transmission bridge to interlay the CdS and TiO2.
The FE-SEM image shows that uniform CdS NSs with an average diameter of 140 nm were obtained with the assistance of surfactant PVP which can prevent the further growth and agglomeration of CdS NSs (Fig. 1a and b).11 The size of CdS NSs could be regulated by adjusting the initial concentration of PVP. With the increase of initial concentration of PVP from 2 mg ml−1 to 10 mg ml−1, the average diameter of CdS NSs decreased from 300 nm to 80 nm (data not shown). Through the electrostatic self-assembly, the positive surface of the PEI-modified CdS NSs is covered by negative-charged GO nanosheets (Fig. 1c and d). The FE-SEM images reveal the noteworthy thin sheet texture of the spherical surface of the GO-coated CdS NSs, compared with clean surface of pristine CdS sphere exhibiting no any notable feature. Partial GO patch peeling off from the CdS NSs core surface and corrugation can be obviously noticed. It proves that the block sheets have indeed been successfully coated onto CdS NSs.

The TEM image further shows that the two-dimensional GO sheet was clearly observed on the surface of CdS NSs and a close interfacial contact between CdS NSs and GO was established (Fig. 2a). After treatment with TiO2 precursor followed by calcination process, the formed TiO2 nanoparticles were tightly decorated onto the rGO sheets on the CdS NSs, making the surface rough (Fig. 1e). The corresponding EDX demonstrates the presence of CdS and TiO2 (Fig. 1f). The TEM image clearly shows that CdS and TiO2 were distinctly interlayed with rGO sheets (Fig. 2b). The measured interplanar spacing of 0.352 nm and 0.316 nm corresponds to (101) lattice planes of TiO2 and the (101) lattice plane of CdS (Fig. 2b), respectively.

The XRD diffraction pattern of the pristine CdS NSs shows that all of the diffraction peaks match well to a hexagonal CdS phase (Fig. S2†). The Raman spectrum demonstrates that the presence of crystalline TiO2 is evident from the strong low frequency Eg mode at 144 cm−1 (Fig. S3†). The resonant excitations at 300 cm−1 and 604 cm−1 correspond to the longitudinal optical (LO) phonon and the first overtones of CdS NSs.12 XPS spectra also verify the presence of TiO2 and rGO in the CdS NSs/rGO/TiO2. Two typical peaks of Ti 2p located at approximately 459.3 and 465.1 eV correspond to the Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2 binding energies which are attributed to the Ti4+ species (Fig. 3a).12 The high-resolution XPS spectra of C 1s can be divided into three smaller peaks (Fig. 3b), which can be assigned to the following functional groups: C–C (sp2 C atoms), C–O (epoxy/hydroxyls) and O–CO (carboxyl).13 The peaks relating to oxygen-containing functional groups are of much lower intensities than those relating to C–C, which indicates the reduction of GO to RGO.9 Fig. 4 present UV-vis absorption spectrum and photographs of the various photocatalysts. A sharp fundamental absorption edge rising at 520 nm can be attributed to the intrinsic band gap absorption of CdS (2.4 eV). The reason for the baseline increase of the spectra of rGO-coupled photocatalyts could be that the light which comes across the sample was prevented by rGO.

The CO2 photocatalytic activity of various photocatalysts was evaluated with UV-visible light illumination under CO2 in the presence of water vapor (Fig. 5). During the photocatalytic reduction reactions, CO2 was mainly reduced to methane (CH4). The CH4 generation rate of the pristine CdS NSs is measured about 0.021 μmol h−1 g−1. Combination of CdS NSs with TiO2 to form CdS/TiO2 heterostructure increases the CH4 generation rate by ∼40%, which is ascribed to spatial separation of electrons and holes between two components. Furthermore, coupling the CdS NSs with rGO makes apparent increase of CH4 evolution by ∼3 times compared to the pristine CdS NSs. It demonstrates that the rapid electron transfer from the excited CdS NSs to rGO allows quick separation of electron and hole to improve the photocatalytic activity. Meanwhile, the photocatalytic activity of the CdS NSs/rGO/TiO2 remarkably increases by ∼3 times compared to CdS NSs/TiO2. It also means that the presence of rGO greatly overcomes the limitation of CdS and TiO2 interparticulate transfer of populated electrons and holes, thus resulting in much improvement in the photocatalytic activity. A CO2 reduction cycle on the same CdS NSs/rGO/TiO2 catalyst shows ∼10% decrease of CH4 generation velocity (Fig. S4†). The rate decrease may be due to the deactivation of the surface catalytic sites of the photocatalyst, possibly resulting from covering of the reduced carbon species. The generation rate ratio of O2 to CH4 over CdS NSs/rGO/TiO2 is 1.7:1, close to the theoretical mole ratio of 2:1 (CO2 + 2H2O → CH4 + 2O2). No nitrogen was detected in the reaction system (Fig. S5†), which eliminates the possibility of origination of oxygen from the ambient atmosphere. A CO2 reduction experiment performed in the dark or in the absence of the photocatalysts showed no appearance of CH4 production, proving that the CO2 reduction reaction is driven by light with the photocatalysts. No methane can be detected when high purity of N2 gas instead of CO2 was injected into the reaction system, suggesting that CO2 should be the source of methane.

The transient time-resolved photoluminescence decay measurements were carried out to investigate the charge transfers in above various photocatalysts (Fig. 6). Transient PL decay trace of the CdS NSs shows the PL lifetime of 0.28 ns. The PL decay time of CdS NSs/rGO decreases to 0.24 ns. It indicates that the conjugated rGO is efficient in interfacially extracting the photoelectrons from the present CdS NSs thereby to form an on-radiative transition pathway for the CdS NSs. The PL decay time of the CdS NSs/TiO2 was measured to be 0.38 ns. The prolongation is believed to attribute to the form type-II heterostructure, in which the photogenerated electrons on the CB of CdS were transited to the CB of TiO2 and the photogenerated holes on the VB of TiO2 shift to the VB of CdS. While all above three samples display a single exponential decay behavior, on the contrary, the CdS NSs/rGO/TiO2 shows a longer lifetime of 2.4 ns with biexponential decay behavior, suggesting the fundamentally different electron transfer mechanism from pristine CdS, CdS NSs/rGO, and CdS NSs/TiO2.

Following Tada's mechanism of CdS/Au/TiO2 Z-scheme,5a we propose the charge-transfer process for the present CdS NSs/rGO/TiO2 system under UV visible-light irradiation, as schematically illustrated in Scheme 1. The excitation of the CdS and TiO2 transiently produces electron–hole pairs with hot electrons at empty states above CB. As the CB edges of TiO2 is negative than the Fermi level of rGO, the photo-generated electrons in the CB of TiO2 prefer to shift to rGO. The transferring electron moves along the rGO to combine with the holes in the VB of CdS. This electron flow consumes the hole of CdS to suppress the electron of CdS to transfer to the ground state, thereby making the survive time of the electron on the CdS NSs increase by approximate an order of magnitude, relative to on the pristine CdS NSs. This mechanism accumulates holes in TiO2 for oxidation of H2O and electrons in CdS for photoreduction of CO2, respectively. The depressed hole density on CdS may also enhance the stability of CdS against photocorrosion.14

Conclusions
An all-solid-state CdS NSs/rGO/TiO2 Z-scheme system was rationally prepared for photocatalytic reduction of CO2 into CH4. The Z-scheme with rGO interlayer as electron conductor leads to the more efficient separation of electron–hole pairs and exhibits remarkable enhancement relative to pure CdS NSs, CdS NSs/TiO2, and CdS NSs/rGO. The present work may provide a promising possibility of low-cost fabrication of complex Z-scheme systems for high-efficiency artificial photosynthesis.
