    , Accepted 5th February 2016First published on 5th February 2016AbstractThe growth and strain-compensation behaviour of InGaAs/GaAsP multi-quantum wells, which were fabricated by metal–organic chemical vapor deposition, have been studied towards the application of these quantum wells in high-power laser diodes. The effect of the height of the potential barrier on the confined level of carrier transport was studied by incorporating different levels of phosphorus content into the GaAsP barrier. The crystal quality and interface roughness of the InGaAs/GaAsP multi-quantum wells with different phosphorus contents were evaluated by high resolution X-ray diffraction and in situ optical surface reflectivity measurements during the growth. The surface morphology and roughness were characterized by atomic force microscopy, which indicates the variation law of surface roughness, terrace width and uniformity with increasing phosphorus content, owing to strain accumulation. Moreover, the defect generation and structural disorder of the multi-quantum wells were investigated by Raman spectroscopy. The optical properties of the multi-quantum wells were characterized by photoluminescence, which shows that the spectral intensity increases as the phosphorus content increases. The results suggest that more electrons are well bound in InGaAs because of the high potential barrier. Finally, the mechanism of the effect of the height of the potential barrier on laser performance was proposed on the basis of simulation calculations and experimental results.
Introduction
InGaAs/GaAsP strain-compensated multiple quantum wells (MQWs), which are promising narrow-band gap materials pseudo-lattice-matched to GaAs,1 have been widely used in laser diodes,2 photodetectors,3 modulators4 and in other electronic devices, and now attention is also being paid to their applications in solar cells.5,6 InGaAs/GaAsP MQWs, with a bandgap of 1.2 eV, can be used as an active region in laser devices and middle cell materials of tandem structures in solar cells to achieve good recombination efficiency and current match conditions, since they can be substantially lattice matched to GaAs by adjusting their average lattice constant. In order to avoid strain accumulation in MQWs that induces crystal defects and thus degrades recombination efficiency, strain balancing, using GaAsP as a tensile strain barrier, has been attempted to compensate the InGaAs compressive well. In practice, however, lattice relaxation easily occurs as a result of lattice mismatch if a high content of indium is incorporated in the wells during growth. In order to make it possible to grow multiple periods of MQWs while maintaining good crystal quality, crystal growth techniques need to be developed.7
A theoretical analysis of lattice relaxation in a lattice-mismatched heterojunction was carried out by Matthews and Blakeslee.8,9 Then, both theoretical and experimental approaches were developed for the relaxation of each of InGaAs and GaAsP layers10 and for the InGaAs/GaAsP stack structure,11 allowing us to design strain-managed heterojunction structures. In order to investigate the strain mismatch degree of MQWs per well/barrier period, the average strain mismatch () is defined as a thickness weighted average between the strain values of InGaAs and GaAsP layers:  = (tInGaAsεInGaAs + tGaAsPεGaAsP)/(tInGaAs + tGaAsP), where t is the layer thickness and ε is the strain of that layer. This definition lacks consideration of the different elastic constants for the two component layers11 but this simple measure, as a starting point of the analysis, will be adopted for the growth of high quality MQWs. On the basis of the above equation, the average strain mismatch can be obtained by altering the barrier thickness and phosphorus content. In order to improve the recombination efficiency and avoid the accumulation of strain in the course of growth, which results in increased dislocations and thus obstacles to carrier transport inside the MQWs,12 the height of the potential barrier is elevated by decreasing the barrier thickness and increasing the phosphorus content.13,14
In order to achieve good high temperature laser performance, it is essential to have very deep electron potential wells. The InGaAs system on a GaAs substrate suffers from poor temperature characteristics owing to the electron overflow over a rather small conduction band offset. The GaAsP barrier design has a very significant impact on reducing carrier leakage because it can improve the stability performance of the laser at high temperature in comparison with the uncompensated barrier. The temperature dependence of these lasers remains an issue that limits their performance at high temperatures. The major problem is that the thermal property is related to the low potential barrier height in the conduction band.15,16 The threshold current increases steeply with temperature and the maximum operating temperature becomes limited. This can be explained by the presence of various loss mechanisms of Auger recombination,17 intervalence band absorption18 and carrier leakage due to the small electron confinement.19 To overcome these problems, alternative growth techniques have been sought after. An InGaAs-based strain-compensated MQW structure with alternating compressive- and tensile-strained layers is promising for optoelectronic device applications.20,21
In this paper, we investigated the structural and optical properties of InGaAs/GaAsP MQWs with different phosphorus contents grown by metal–organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD). In addition, the height of the potential barrier, carrier distribution and band offset in a InGaAs/GaAsP double quantum well laser system were simulated by Harrison's model according to the different phosphorus contents in the GaAsP barrier. The use of the GaAsP barrier with different phosphorus contents results in the strain-compensated laser system having a better band offset than conventional strained InGaAs. Therefore, high temperature operation is anticipated in these laser systems with strain compensated barriers because better electron and hole confinement is realized as a result of the increased band offset and more favorable band offset.22 Having different phosphorus contents can improve the high characteristic temperatures of the threshold current density for lasers.23–25 It has been demonstrated that to obtain a low threshold and a high differential gain, the quantum well has to be designed to have a density of states that is as low as possible and a closely matched density of states in the valence and conduction bands. This is very dependent on the band offsets. The penalty for a low density of states is that the Fermi level rises rapidly with temperature; hence the high ratio (QC) of the conduction band offset (ΔEC) improves the electron confinement, especially at high temperature, and this will lead to improved gain. However, it is important not to have too large a valence band offset when a large number of quantum wells are present in the active region, to allow the heavier holes to equally occupy all of the quantum wells. Therefore, there needs to be a balance between all these criteria for good gain. The optimized band offsets will improve the laser performance, and a balance between the density of states that exists in the quantum well (both electron and hole states) is still required.26 Thus, there is a need to understand the reasons for the discrepancies in the investigation of the influence of barrier height on the optical, electrical and thermal properties of InGaAs/GaAsP MQWs.
Experimental details
InGaAs/GaAsP MQWs were epitaxially grown on (001) n-type GaAs substrates by MOCVD using trimethylgallium (TMGa), trimethylindium (TMIn), arsine (AsH3), phosphine (PH3) and high-purity H2 carrier gas under the same growth conditions. The growth temperature and reactor pressure were fixed at 650 °C and 15 torr, respectively. Moreover, the growth rate and V/III-ratios during the growth were ∼1.8 μm h−1 and 80, respectively. The structure of the InGaAs/GaAsP MQWs is illustrated in Fig. 1(a). In this study, six phosphorus content values in the vapor of AsH3 and PH3 were evaluated. The growth process started with a 300 nm GaAs buffer layer which was grown on a GaAs(001) substrate with TMGa (94 sccm) and AsH3 (1160 sccm) with a growth time of about 600 s. Subsequently, the MQWs investigated here consist of InxGa1−xAs with a thickness of 10 nm and an indium content of x ≈ 0.140 in the solid corresponding to a theoretical In/Ga molar ratio of 0.160 grown in 20 s. A strain compensation layer was achieved by using 10 nm GaAs1−yPy barriers grown in 20 s with a phosphorus content in the solid of y = 0, 0.015, 0.111, 0.145, 0.212 and 0.277, corresponding to flow ratios of 0, 10%, 38%, 45%, 60% and 70% of PH3/(AsH3 + PH3) in vapor, respectively. Finally, a GaAsP barrier layer, as the capping layer, was grown after six periods for six samples.
 Fig. 1  Schematics of InGaAs/GaAsP MQWs (a) and laser device structure with two InGaAs/GaAsP quantum wells (b). 
In this study, we designed a laser structure with two InGaAs/GaAsP quantum wells using a six-by-six K·P method and we investigated the optical and electrical properties of the laser diode. The schematic diagrams of the laser device structure and the simulation parameters, such as thickness and carrier concentration, are shown in Fig. 1(b). The six devices retained the same structure with two InGaAs/GaAsP quantum wells and were simulated using the same simulation parameters, except for the phosphorus compositions of the barrier (0, 0.015, 0.111, 0.145, 0.212 and 0.277). The thickness of the barrier and well is 10 nm and the indium composition in InGaAs is 0.140. The electron and hole mobilities are assumed to be 5000 and 150 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, and the operating temperature is assumed to be 300 K. The dislocation density is assumed to be 100 cm−2 for each layer.
According to the simulation parameters and the structure of the laser device as well as the optimized growth conditions, these laser devices were grown at the growth temperature (650 °C) and the rate (∼1.8 μm h−1) remained the same during the growth.
In order to verify the interfacial crystal quality, the interface roughness, thickness, composition, and strain mismatch for each well and barrier of InGaAs/GaAsP MQWs, six samples were analyzed by high-resolution X-ray diffraction (HRXRD) omega–2theta scanning of (004) planes at 40 kV and 40 mA using Cu Kα X-rays with a wavelength of 0.15406 nm and a scan range of 3°. Reflectance was measured in situ during growth at a wavelength of 930 nm with a commercial system (EpiR-MTT, Laytec) to monitor the surface morphology. The incident light from an LED lamp was focused on the sample after being passed through a polarizer. The light reflected by the sample was subsequently reflected again by an anti-wobble mirror and then went back through the same light path as the incident beam. The returned light was then led through a photoelastic modulator, an analyzer and a monochromator, so that the chosen wavelength of light could be detected. Morphological analysis and the root mean square (RMS) surface roughness were characterized by atomic force microscopy (AFM) in non-contact mode at room temperature. The optical properties of the InGaAs/GaAsP MQWs were measured by photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy with a continuous wave laser at 532 nm. The PL spectra were recorded at room temperature with a scan rate of 40 nm s−1 and a slit width of 0.02 mm in the wavelength range of 840 to 1050 nm by a single grating spectrometer (300–500 g mm−1) with a CCD1024BT-TE detector. The structural disorder of the six samples was investigated by Raman spectroscopy using a continuous wave laser with a 514.5 nm line of an argon ion laser used as exciting radiation at room temperature. The calculated bandgap diagram, emission and gain spectra and internal quantum efficiency of the laser structure were simulated by a simulator of light emitters based on nitride semiconductors (SiLENSe) software using a six-by-six K·P method. The epitaxial wafers of the laser were processed into bars with 100 μm stripe widths and the cavity lengths were designed as 1000, 2000 and 3000 μm. Ti/Pt/Au and AuGeNi/Au were deposited as the P-electrode and N-electrode, respectively. The P–I–V characteristics of the laser devices with different cavity lengths were measured under 1 A at room temperature, using an AvaSpec-2048 fiber optic spectrometer. In order to ensure the accuracy of the data, these wafers were processed into chips twice and ten chips were measured for each cavity length, and the photoelectric parameters, such as power, threshold current, slope efficiency, wavelength and voltage, were obtained.
Results and discussion
The results of the HRXRD measurements are shown in Fig. 2(a). Sufficiently sharp satellite peaks from the InGaAs/GaAsP MQW layer are observed, indicating the high crystal quality and homogeneity of both the well- and barrier-thickness and composition in the MQWs. Each well and barrier composition and thickness in the MQWs are estimated by fitting the observed HRXRD rocking curves, and the fitting results are shown in Table 1. Approximately 10 nm thicknesses and indium contents of 0.140 for the well InGaAs layer were obtained for each sample. The barrier thickness is around 10 nm for each sample. The different phosphorus contents of the barrier layer were obtained corresponding to the different phosphine flow ratios in vapor during the growth of MQWs, and the solid content in GaAsP is shown in Table 1.

To get an indication of the hetero-interface quality for the InGaAs/GaAsP MQWs, the HRXRD FWHM as a function of peak order is shown in Fig. 2(b) along with the HRXRD patterns. This approach for assessing the interface quality for GaNxAs1−x/GaAs superlattices was reported in ref. 27 and 28. From the (004) symmetric HRXRD patterns of the samples in Fig. 2(a), the periodic thickness, content and strain mismatch are obtained by the simulation of the diffraction patterns, as listed in Table 1. In real MQWs, the interface roughness would broaden the satellite peaks,29 except for the zeroth-order one. If the interface roughness is described by a function of periodical thickness fluctuations, expressed by a Gaussian distribution function with standard deviation σ, the FWHM of the nth peak will be expressed as30 (1)where n is the order of the satellite peak, Λ0 is the period thickness, ΔθM is the angle distance between adjacent satellite peaks, σ/Λ0 is the interface roughness, and W0 and Wn are the FWHM of the zeroth- and nth-order peaks, respectively. The dependence of the FWHM of the satellite peaks on the satellite orders from Fig. 2(a) can be fitted by eqn (1), which shows a linear relationship, as shown in Fig. 2(b). The variation tendency of the interface roughness is shown by the inset in Fig. 2(b). The interface roughness decreases corresponding to increasing the phosphorus content below 0.145 in the GaAsP barrier. This result indicates that the increased tensile strain compensates the compressive strain, resulting in a reduced total accumulated strain. As the phosphorus content increases above 0.145, the increase in interface roughness is attributed to the diffusion of phosphorus at the hetero-interface during the growth.31 Therefore, the interfacial quality of the sample with a phosphorus content of 0.145 is the best among these samples, and the corresponding interface roughness is the minimum.
The transient surface reflectance spectra of a series of InGaAs/GaAsP MQWs were measured in the course of growth, as shown in Fig. 3. All the reflectance values are normalized by the value on the GaAs surface at the start of the MQWs' growth. A periodic feature is found for all the reflectance transients as the result of Fabry–Perot interference oscillation during the MQW growth; it decreases and increases during GaAsP and InGaAs growth, respectively. If the lattice relaxation is negligible and the surface remains flat, the average reflectance remains at a constant value, which is determined by the average refractive index of the InGaAs/GaAsP MQWs.32 For the sample with a phosphorus content of 0.111, the transient reflectance of the MQWs shows behavior typical of a strain-balanced quantum well structure. The time resolved surface reflectivity maintains almost constant oscillations, which are attributed to the different reflective indexes between the well and the barrier, and ends with a similar value as at the beginning of the growth. However, for samples with phosphorus contents below 0.111, only after four stabilizing periods does the surface reflectivity exhibit constant oscillations. From the variation tendency of the surface reflectivity, we can conclude that the crystal quality and interface at the start of the MQWs' growth are good, but they degrade after two periods. This result could be caused by compressive strain, which would result in the formation of defects or a rough interface. The rough interface is demonstrated in Fig. 2(b). The surface reflectivity maintains constant oscillations at the end of the MQWs' growth because of the annealing process during growth. When the phosphorus content increases above 0.111, the surface reflectivity gradually drops at the start of the MQWs' growth for two periods, which indicates the degraded surface morphology. Then the amplitude of oscillations in the GaAsP decreases continuously till the end of growth, and the surface reflectivity becomes constant.33 The results indicate that a high phosphorus content could increase the number of defects at the hetero-junction interface, even though it reduces the total strain mismatch. The influence of defects and interface morphology in the MQWs is decreased or ended by the upper layer with a sufficient thickness, so the defects embedded at the interfaces of the MQWs are localized.34
 Fig. 3  
In situ surface reflectance measured at 1.32 eV during the course of the MQWs' growth. All the reflectance values are normalized by the value of the GaAs surface at the start of the MQWs' growth. 
To verify the growth model and evaluate the surface roughness of the InGaAs/GaAsP MQWs, the surface morphologies of six samples with different phosphorus contents were analyzed by AFM, and the RMS roughness values are shown in Fig. 4. The growth mode of six samples follows a step flow in term of surface morphologies. A notable feature is that the RMS value is significantly improved at a phosphorus content of 0.145 (Fig. 4(d)) with the minimum value of RMS = 0.143 nm. The result is consistent with the interface roughness demonstrated by HRXRD analysis. The parallel and straight edges of terraces indicate that a high quality hetero-interface can be grown as a result of the balanced diffusion length of atoms adsorbed on the growing surface in both [110] and [10] crystal orientations.35 The atomic ordering of InGaAs and GaAsP compounds occurs during growth, which is in agreement with the reflectivity value. Upon decreasing further the phosphorus content of GaAsP, the tensile strain mismatch decreases so that the total strain mismatch increases, as shown in Table 1. As can be seen in Fig. 4(a) and (b), the terraces become bowed and the width of terraces becomes non-uniform as a result of the increasing total strain mismatch.36 The RMS surface roughness increases from 0.143 to 0.245 nm. A number of wide dark parallel belt structures on the surface can be observed (Fig. 4(a) and (b)). The formation of the dark groove belts can be explained by the distortion degree releasing the compressive stress in the MQWs along with the decrease in phosphorus content.37 The RMS value of the MQWs for the sample with 0 phosphorus content is the largest, which can be demonstrated by the drastic decrease in reflectivity value during growth after two periods.

When the phosphorus content of GaAsP increases from 0.145 to 0.277, the bowed terraces disappear. However, the emergence of pits exhibits the formation of defects during growth. Bigger pits are observed from Fig. 4(f), which can be caused by the enhanced incorporation of P atoms, stimulating P-like interstitial defect formation, deteriorating the interface quality. From the in situ surface reflectance for the sample with a phosphorus content of 0.277, the reflectivity of the first GaAsP barrier decreases during initial growth owing to the variation of the refractive index of the GaAsP material. Then, the reflectivity further decreases in the course of the growth of the second barrier, which is attributed to the deterioration of the surface morphology. The consecutive deposition of two materials with a very large lattice mismatch would result in the formation of defects or a rough interface, which would inevitably cause composition fluctuation vertically and horizontally. However, the growth model of step flow is still observed in the end as a result of the localization of defects, because the reflectivity becomes regular.

Fig. 5 shows the PL spectra of the InGaAs/GaAsP MQWs samples with different phosphorus contents. Two peaks around 871 nm and 963 nm are observed, which correspond to the bandgap of bulk GaAs and the effective bandgap energy of the MQWs at room temperature, respectively. The PL peak corresponding to the effective bandgap of the MQWs shifts to a shorter wavelength with increasing phosphorus content in the GaAsP barrier. This result seems to be attributed to the increased confined energy level in the quantum well as the result of the higher potential barrier due to the increased phosphorus content in GaAsP.38,39 The relative intensity of the PL peaks for each sample becomes stronger for the higher phosphorus content MQW samples. Because the structure of the samples is the same except for the phosphorus content in the GaAsP barriers, this result may be mainly attributed to two factors: firstly, the reduced total compressive strain by increasing the reasonable phosphorus content in the barrier leads to a reduced defect density in the MQW layer. Secondly, the confined energy level of the potential barrier height increases with increasing phosphorus content so that more electrons are trapped in the InGaAs wells. The radiative recombination of photoexcited carriers increases as a result of the reduced thermal escape probability of an electron from the quantum well with an increased potential barrier height,40 even though a large number of defects emerge at the hetero-interface of InGaAs and GaAsP owing to the high phosphorus content. Therefore, the PL intensity increases with increasing phosphorus content in the GaAsP quantum barrier.
 Fig. 5  PL spectra of InGaAs/GaAsP MQWs grown on (001) GaAs substrate with different phosphorus contents. 
In order to explain the phenomena that the PL intensity increases with increasing phosphorus content, we propose a simple recombination model for the dynamics of photoexcited carriers. Three relaxation processes are proposed: (i) thermal escape from the InGaAs well, and (ii) non-radiative and (iii) radiative carrier recombination within the InGaAs well. Each process is shown in Fig. 6.
 Fig. 6  Three proposed carrier relaxation processes based on the van Roosbroeck–Shockley treatment: the signal generation efficiencies for thermal escape, non-radiative and radiative recombination. 
As shown in Fig. 6, the increased PL intensity of the InGaAs/GaAsP MQWs at high phosphorus content is mainly attributed to the increased probability of radiative recombination. However, a InGaAsP thin layer could be formed as a result of phosphorus carry-over at a high molar flow of phosphine.41 This occurrence could result in the formation of a non-radiative recombination center. We could conclude that the PL intensity is mainly affected by the thermal escape of carriers rather than the non-radiative recombination center in the strain-balanced MQWs. With low phosphorus content in the GaAsP barrier, the probability of non-radiative recombination increases owing to the large total accumulated strain mismatch. Moreover, the probability of thermal escape of carriers from the InGaAs well increases because of the low potential barrier. The PL signal generation efficiencies can be defined by the following equation, according to the van Roosbroeck–Shockley treatment:42 (2)where τth, τNR and τRA are the thermal escape, non-radiative and radiative recombination times, respectively. In addition, τNR and τth are temperature-dependent, as expressed by the following equations:43–45 (3) (4)where C0 is a constant, ΔENR is the activation energy of non-radiative carrier recombination, mW is the electron effective mass in the quantum well, W is the well width, k is the Boltzmann constant, and ΔEbarr.(F) is the barrier height of the electron in the e1-subband. In the presence of a built-in electric field F, the barrier height can be written as (5)where ΔECB is the conduction band offset, Ee1 is the energy of the e1-subband measured from the center of the well, and q is the electron charge.
Raman spectra of the InGaAs/GaAsP MQWs with different phosphorus contents were recorded at room temperature in a backscattering configuration with the 514.5 nm line of an argon ion laser as the exciting radiation, as shown in Fig. 7(a). In this configuration the scattering from zone center LO phonons is allowed and that from transverse optical (TO) phonons is forbidden.46 The features in the Raman spectra shown in Fig. 7(a) are attributed to GaAs-like LO phonons from the InGaAs alloy layers of the MQW region and GaAs LO phonons from the GaAs buffer layer. InAs-like LO features are not observed in the samples because of their small x values (x < 0.2). Because of the small gap between the optical frequencies of the bulk InAs and GaAs modes (and its reduction by the local strain effects), the GaAs- and InAs-like polar LO modes couple strongly together. Their repelling accounts for the variation in nonlinear frequency versus composition.47,48 The epitaxial layers sustain compression or tension accordingly as the lattice constant of the epitaxial layers is larger or smaller than that of the substrate. The opposite forces may make antipodal changes in the frequency of lattice vibrations. In the case of the GaAs-like LO mode of InGaAs, compression makes the frequency shift higher and tension makes it shift lower, as can be seen in Fig. 7. This is also true for the relation between the epitaxial layers and the substrate. That is, if the epitaxial layers undergo compression, the substrate will sustain tension. These opposite forces for each substance may create the antipodal shifts. It has been demonstrated experimentally and analytically that the GaAs-related LO phonon from the InGaAs/GaAsP MQWs sample is composed of two LO phonon modes as the phosphorus content increases. One comes from the GaAs buffer layer because the thin MQWs can penetrate into the GaAs buffer layer,49 giving a GaAs LO phonon peak, as shown in Fig. 7(a). The other comes from InGaAs and GaAsP layers in the MQW region, giving a GaAs-like LO phonon peak. For the GaAs-like LO phonon mode, the in-plane biaxial compressive or tensile stress shifts it towards a higher or lower frequency respectively, and makes its line shape asymmetrically broader.50 The variation with phosphorus content of GaAsP of the GaAs-like LO phonon frequency and line shape of the InGaAs/GaAsP MQWs indicates that the GaAs-like LO phonon frequency shifts towards a lower frequency with respect to their bulk values owing to the increase in tensile stress, as shown in Fig. 7(a). Moreover, the GaP-like LO phonon emerges and shifts towards a higher frequency, and the GaAs LO splits from the GaAs-like LO phonon as the phosphorus content increases. The Raman spectra were fitted by a Lorentzian function in order to obtain the widths and intensities of the GaAs-related LO phonon frequency and TO. The calculated LO/TO ratio values of the GaAs-like and the GaAs-like LO FWHM are shown in Fig. 7(b). The increase in the linewidth of the GaAs-like LO phonon and the decrease in the frequency shift at the surface indicate that the releasing of the residual strains occurs through defect generation and structural disorder.51–53

The Raman selection rules are frequently used to analyze the crystalline quality of the samples.54–57 According to these rules, for zinc blende crystals on the (001) surface, the TO phonon is forbidden and the LO phonon is allowed. Since the presence of the TO phonon is indicative of structural disorder, the ratio of TO to LO peak intensities (ITO/LO) is a direct measure of the relative strength of the mechanical to electro-optic coupling in electron–phonon interactions, which is of importance for a quantitative assessment of disorder effects.58–60Fig. 7(a) shows the Raman intensity ratio between the allowed LO and the forbidden mixed-TO phonons from samples grown with different phosphorus contents. The Raman intensity ratio IInAs-LO/Imixed-TO decreases as the phosphorus content increases, indicating a reduction in the ordering of the samples. In Fig. 7(b), the FWHM values of the allowed phonon resonances (InAs-LO and GaP-LO) are plotted as a function of phosphorus content. The increasing value of the FWHM peak suggests a reduction in the crystalline quality of the InGaAa/GaAsP MQWs.54,57
The indium content in the InGaAs well is fixed to allow an emission wavelength of about 965 nm while the phosphorus content in the GaAs1−yPy barrier is varied. Fig. 8(a) and (b) illustrate the calculated bandgap diagram and the corresponding band offsets according to the different phosphorus contents. These variations show that the strain compensation with opposite strain in the barrier enables deeper wells to be obtained, leading to much better confinement both in the conduction band (CB) and the valence band (VB). In order to investigate the variation of the band offsets in the MQWs, the difference between the bandgap of the barriers and the bandgap of the quantum well (ΔE) is divided between the conduction and valence bands as ΔEC and ΔEV, respectively. The ratio ΔEC/ΔEV, termed the band offset ratio, has an intrinsic value for a particular quantum well/barrier system. For high-temperature operation, it is important that ΔEC > ΔEV because the light effective mass electrons are easily elevated to higher states with increasing temperature. This process both reduces gain and increases the thermal leakage current. It is important not to have too large a ΔEV when MQWs are present in the active region to allow the heavier holes to equally occupy all the quantum wells.61 From Fig. 8(b), the conduction- and valence-band offset ratio occurs at about 0.65 and 0.35, respectively. It should be noted that the result of the band offset ratio is close to those reported.62–64 As can be observed from Fig. 8(c) and (d), the electron and hole concentrations are unequally distributed in the two InGaAs wells at phosphorus contents above 0.212, and especially, there is a significant difference between the two wells with a phosphorus content of 0.277. Furthermore, carriers could not be trapped in the well owing to the height of the barrier at low phosphorus contents (0 and 0.015), resulting in the decrease in the carrier confinement level. Carriers can be observed in the barrier because of carrier leakage from the well. Fig. 8(e) and (f) illustrate the material gain and intensity for different phosphorus contents in the GaAsP barrier versus wavelength under conditions of the same well and barrier width. A larger peak gain can be obtained below a phosphorus content of 0.212 in the expected wavelength range of 955–963 nm. Fig. 8(g) shows the relationship between the internal quantum efficiency (IQE), current density and wavelength for different phosphorus contents in the GaAsP barrier. The results indicate that a high current density results in a low IQE, which is attributed to the carrier leakage. The IQE increases as the height of the barrier increases because more carriers can be trapped in the InGaAs well.

The above laser structures are characterized by extracting the device parameters from measurements of broad area (100 μm cavity width) diode lasers with various cavity lengths. The threshold (Ith) current, external differential quantum efficiency (ηd) and emission power (P0) of laser chips with 2000 μm cavity length were measured under a forward current of 1 A, as shown in Fig. 9(a), which indicates that the optimal photoelectric parameters are obtained at a phosphorus content of 0.145. The low threshold current density is obtained because the large band offset suppresses carrier leakage out of the quantum well to the confining region65,66 and better interfacial structure decreases the interface scattering at the interface in MQWs. However, a large band offset leads to a higher conduction band of the barrier compared to that of the waveguide layer. This result results in the non-uniform distribution of electrons and holes in quantum well, as shown in Fig. 8(c) and (d). The injection efficiency of carriers decreases owing to the high potential barrier, which is in agreement with the tendency of current in Fig. 8(g). Thus, high P content induces high threshold current density. Meanwhile, the threshold current density also increases owing to the interfacial scattering of the InGaAsP diffusion layer formed during the growth.66

A linear fit to the external differential quantum efficiency yields values for the internal quantum efficiency (ηi) and internal loss (αi), as shown in Fig. 9(b). The modal gain (G0·Γ) and transparency current density (Jtr) are also extracted from eqn (6) by fitting the measured threshold current density with various cavity lengths, and the fitted results are shown in Fig. 9(b). (6)where the reflectance value R = 0.29 for the as-cleaved facets, L is the cavity-length, and ηinj is the current injection efficiency (i.e., the fraction of current density entering the active region), which equals the internal quantum efficiency.
In order to understand the causes of the variation of the threshold current, the transparency carrier density was analyzed. The transparency current density can be expressed as a function of various recombination mechanisms as follows:67,68 Jtr = (A·ntr + B·ntr2 + C·ntr3)·q·Lz(7)where A, B, C and ntr are the Schottky–Read–Hall nonradiative recombination, spontaneous radiative recombination, and Auger recombination coefficients and the transparency carrier density, respectively; q is the unit charge, and Lz is the active region thickness. In the analysis, all the recombination coefficients, A, B and C, as well as the transparency carrier density (ntr), are considered to be functions of temperature. From Fig. 9(b), the lowest transparency current density is obtained at a phosphorus content of 0.145 which is attributed to the low Schottky–Read–Hall nonradiative recombination in terms of low interfacial roughness and surface roughness, as shown by the HRXRD and AFM results, respectively. Meanwhile, it can be also affected by Auger recombination due to the decreasing escape of carriers from the InGaAs well.20
Experimentally, the transparency carrier density has also been shown to have a strong dependence on temperature changes.69 In order to improve laser performance over a broad temperature range, it is desirable to reduce the temperature sensitivity. Long-wavelength and high-temperature laser operation is achieved by introducing a strain-compensated GaAsP layer. The improvement of crystal quality and carrier confinement for quantum wells containing GaAsP can reduce the leakage current and material defect concentration, as well as non-radiation recombination,70 which lowers the temperature sensitivity of the threshold current, resulting in a larger characteristic temperature for edge-emitting quantum well lasers.68,71,72 Since compressively strained quantum wells can reduce the effective hole mass with respect to unstrained quantum wells, the effective hole mass increases as the strain compensation increases.67,73 With phosphorus contents above 0.145, the internal efficiency and loss decrease. This result could be caused by the tunneling effect of the carriers because the GaAsP barrier thickness decreases owing to the formation of a thin InGaAsP layer as a result of the carry-over effect of phosphine during growth.33,42,74,75 The variation of modal gain is attributed to the refractive index of the GaAsP barrier, which is inversely proportional to the threshold current.76,77 Therefore, with GaAsP tensile barriers at 0.145 phosphorus content, low transparency carrier density and high internal efficiency are obtained along with significant improvement in the aging performance of the InGaAs/GaAsP quantum well lasers. The low transparency current density of the InGaAs/GaAsP quantum well laser devices may reflect a low defect density at the interface between the well and the barrier.74
Conclusion
The effect of the phosphorus content in GaAsP barriers on the interfacial structure and the performance of laser diodes was investigated. Better interfacial structure and photoelectric properties were obtained, and the interfacial roughness and surface morphologies of InGaAs/GaAsP multiple quantum wells were optimized when the phosphorus content was about 0.145. The carrier leakage out of the InGaAs well was significantly suppressed by the enhanced height of the potential barrier. Meanwhile, the non-uniform distribution of electrons and holes was induced as a result of the high phosphorus content, as can be demonstrated by simulation. Lasers with different strain-compensated InGaAs/GaAsP quantum wells were fabricated, leading to a significant improvement in the transparency current density as well as power conversion efficiency at a reasonable phosphorus content.
