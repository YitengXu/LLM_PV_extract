    , Accepted 12th June 2015First published on 17th June 2015AbstractThe interaction strength of Au nanoparticles with pristine and nitrogen doped TiO2 nanowire surfaces was analysed using density functional theory and their significance in enhancing the solar driven photoelectrocatalytic properties was elucidated. In this article, we prepared 4-dimethylaminopyridine capped Au nanoparticle decorated TiO2 nanowire systems. The density functional theory calculations show {101} facets of TiO2 as the preferred phase for dimethylaminopyridine–Au nanoparticles anchoring with a binding energy of −8.282 kcal mol−1. Besides, the interaction strength of Au nanoparticles was enhanced nearly four-fold (−35.559 kcal mol−1) at {101} facets via nitrogen doping, which indeed amplified the Au nanoparticle density on nitrided TiO2. The Au coated nitrogen doped TiO2 (N–TiO2–Au) hybrid electrodes show higher absorbance owing to the light scattering effect of Au nanoparticles. In addition, N–TiO2–Au hybrid electrodes block the charge leakage from the electrode to the electrolyte and thus reduce the charge recombination at the electrode/electrolyte interface. Despite the beneficial band narrowing effect of nitrogen in TiO2 on the electrochemical and visible light activity in N–TiO2–Au hybrid electrodes, it results in low photocurrent generation at higher Au NP loading (3.4 × 10−7 M) due to light blocking the N–TiO2 surface. Strikingly, even with a ten-fold lower Au NP loading (0.34 × 10−7 M), the synergistic effects of nitrogen doping and Au NPs on the N–TiO2–Au hybrid system yield high photocurrent compared to TiO2 and TiO2–Au electrodes. As a result, the N–TiO2–Au electrode produces nearly 270 μmol h−1 cm−2 hydrogen, which is nearly two-fold higher than the pristine TiO2 counterpart. The implications of these findings for the design of efficient hybrid photoelectrocatalytic electrodes are discussed.
Introduction
Semiconductor photocatalysis and photoelectrochemistry, particularly involving TiO2, is an influential field that plays an important role on environmental remediation and energy conversion applications. The striking features of TiO2 including its high chemical stability in aqueous media, high photoactivity, earth abundance and environmentally benign nature strongly encourage the use of this material as a potential electron acceptor in light driven devices operating under solar radiation.1,2 The primary report on photoelectrocatalytic (PEC) water oxidation on TiO2 by Fujishima and Honda3 has promoted a huge body literature on the design of nanostructured photocatalytic materials for realizing the solar driven PEC water oxidation process.4,5 Moreover, the photogenerated holes at the valence band of TiO2 energetically favour the oxidation process of chemical components (like pollutants, etc.). This process can be understood as a renaissance of natural photosynthesis utilizing man-made materials. Nonetheless, the short wavelength cut-off property of TiO2 permits accessing only a narrow segment (∼5%) of the solar spectrum; resulting in low PEC efficiency.6 Conversely, the VB edge position (∼3.2 V vs. NHE) of TiO2 meets the energy requirement for successful PEC water oxidation, where most of the visible light band gap materials such as CdS, CdSe, GaAs, and GaP fall short.7,8 Therefore, developing strategies to amplify the light harvesting efficiency of TiO2 (greater than 5%) without sacrificing its PEC water oxidation potential is strongly in demand to further improve the PEC performance of TiO2.
In this context, gold nanoparticle (Au NP) supported TiO2 hybrid photocatalytic systems have attracted much attention because of their strong light absorption in the visible region, which arises from enhanced scattering and localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR).9–11 Due to LSPR, Au NPs can effectively harvest the electromagnetic energy of the incident light and concentrate it into “plasmonic hotspots”, which in turn can maximize the local field intensity by a factor of 106.12 Notably, one dimensional (1-D) TiO2 nanostructures such as nanowires, nanotubes, nanofibers, etc. afford ample room to accommodate the nanoparticles compared to their bulk counterparts.13 Moreover, the rapid electron transport in the 1-D TiO2 crystallite framework is highly beneficial for the efficient charge collection at the relevant interfaces.14,15 In the case of TiO2–Au hybrid photocatalytic systems, neither individual Au NPs nor TiO2 can act as an efficient photocatalyst upon visible-light irradiation,16 but a proper combination of both materials generates excellent visible-light PEC performances, even significantly enhancing the UV photocatalysis of TiO2.17–21 This indicates that the interfacial interaction between Au NPs and TiO2 plays a key role in achieving optimum PEC performance.
So far, a number of strategies have been documented in the literature for anchoring the Au NPs on TiO2 surfaces. For instance, Au NPs were coated on TiO2via physical evaporation or sputtering resulting in the formation of inhomogenous NP coating on the metal oxide host surface.22,23 Alternatively, it has been reported that Au NPs can also be deposited on TiO2 substrates via directly reducing gold salts by chemical reduction or photodeposition.24–28 Unfortunately, such deposition techniques affect the supporting semiconductors due to the multiple post-treatment steps. Similarly, controlling the size, shape and distribution of Au NPs using such approaches still remains challenging. Recently, we have demonstrated a straightforward method of anchoring 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) capped Au NPs on TiO2 hollow nanowires, which in turn resulted in enhanced photocatalytic performance towards dye degradation.29 In the present study, we investigate the underlying mechanism behind the single-step anchoring of DMAP capped Au NPs on TiO2 nanowires and their respective interactions were studied using theoretical simulations based on first principle theory. The interaction between DMAP capped Au NPs and TiO2 nanowires was modulated via nitrogen doping TiO2. The influence of nitrogen doping and DMAP capped Au NPs anchoring on TiO2 band modification was elucidated. The finite-difference time domain (FDTD) method was used to quantitatively analyse the electromagnetic field enhancement in the TiO2–Au hybrid photocatalytic system. Our theoretical and experimental results demonstrate the synergistic effect of Au NPs (visible light scattering) and nitrogen doping (band gap narrowing effect) on the PEC water oxidation process and the implications of these findings are discussed.
Experimental
Materials
All materials were received from Sigma-Aldrich and used as received.
Fabrication of TiO2 nanowire arrays
Vertically aligned TiO2 hollow nanowires onto FTO substrates were grown using ZnO nanorod array templates. First step, ZnO film of 200 nm was deposited on the FTO substrate using radio frequency magnetron sputtering. Following that, the ZnO seed layer coated FTO substrate was immersed into aqueous solution of 0.025 M zinc nitrate hexahydrate and 0.025 M hexamethylenetetramine and the sample was kept at 85 °C for 10 h for the growth of vertically aligned ZnO nanorod arrays. After ZnO nanorod growth, the substrates were rinsed with deionized water.
In the second step, the TiO2 layer will be grown on ZnO nanorod arrays as follows: the resultant ZnO NR array template was kept in aqueous solution of 0.075 M ammonium hexafluorotitanate and 0.2 M boric acid. This chemical bath deposition results in the thin layer of TiO2 coating ZnO nanorods. Subsequently, the TiO2 coated ZnO electrode is immersed in a 0.5 M boric acid solution for 1 h and the ZnO template is removed and rinsed with deionized water. Finally, vertically aligned TiO2 NW arrays are obtained. The TiO2 NW samples were calcined at 500 °C for 0.5 h under an Ar atmosphere.
For nitridation onto TiO2 NWs, the electrodes were transferred to a chemical vapour deposition (CVD) chamber. The nitridation process was carried out at 500 °C with H2 and NH3 with flow rates of 50–200 standard cubic centimetre per minute (sccm) and 100–300 sccm, respectively.
Synthesis of Au NPs
DMAP-capped Au NPs were synthesized using the phase transfer procedure.30 Briefly, 0.030 M aqueous solution of HAuCl4·3H2O was added to 0.025 M tetraoctylammonium bromide (TOAB) in toluene. Then, 0.4 M aqueous NaBH4 was added drop-wise to the mixture with stirring, causing an immediate reduction to occur. After 24 h, the two phases were separated and the toluene phase was subsequently washed with 0.1 M H2SO4, 0.1 M NaOH, and H2O (three times), and then dried over anhydrous Na2SO4. An equal volume of 0.1 M aqueous solution of DMAP was then added. The phase transfer is clearly visible as the dark pink coloured solution transfers from toluene to water due to the addition of DMAP and was completed within 1 h. Assuming a 100% efficient reduction of gold chloride and no losses during transfer and washing steps, the particle size yields a particle concentration of approximately 6.8 × 10−7 M in the stock solution arising from the nanoparticle synthesis.
Assembly of Au NPs on TiO2 nanowire arrays
Au NP coating on TiO2 and N–TiO2 NW arrays was obtained by immersing the TiO2 electrodes in positively charged, water soluble DMAP-capped Au NP solution (3.4 × 10−7 M) for 5 min. The positively charged DMAP-capped Au NPs were attracted towards the negatively charged surface of TiO2 NWs and N–TiO2 NWs, resulting in the facile formation of electrostatically assembled TiO2–Au and N–TiO2–Au hybrid photocatalytic electrodes. After coating Au NPs on these electrodes DMAP molecules were removed by the sintering process.
Theoretical calculations
The energy calculations were performed using the PW91 method generalized gradient approximation (GGA) and the plane wave model using CASTEP program. The supercell of 20 Å ×20 Å × c was used for the calculation, which represents the nanowire length along the tube axis as c. All atoms were described using Vanderbilt ultrasoft pseudopotentials and a cut off energy of 240 eV where a set of k-points was used to expand the electronic wave function based on the Monkhorst–Pack scheme within 5.0 × 10−5 eV per atom of total energy convergence. Electron density was investigated with optimized geometries. The binding energies of atoms on the nanotubes were calculated by eqn (1) Eb = Enanotube+atom − (Enanotube + Eatom).(1)
Structural and optical characterization
The surface of various TiO2 nanowire arrays was characterized using a field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, JEM-3100F, Jeol, Tokyo, Japan) and a field emission transmission electron microscope (FE-TEM, JSM 7600F, JEOL, Tokyo, Japan). The chemical environment of pure and N doped TiO2 electrodes was analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) using an angular resolved electron analyzer with a monochromated Al Kα source (Theta Probe, Thermo Fisher Scientific). The optical diffuse reflectance spectra of the electrodes were recorded in the range of 350–900 nm using a V670 JASCO UV-Vis spectrophotometer. The absorbance of the electrodes was estimated from diffuse reflectance measurements (R) directly using the Kubelka–Munk relation, F.R. = (1 − R)2/2R using in built software from a JASCO UV-Vis spectrometer. We have assumed that the scattering term is similar for photoelectrodes with and without Au loading.
(Photo)-electrochemical characterization
The (photo)-electrochemical analysis was done using a three electrode configuration. The as-prepared TiO2, TiO2–Au, N–TiO2 and N–TiO2–Au electrodes (electrode area 1 cm2) were used as the working electrode, Ag/AgCl as the reference and Pt foil as the counter electrode. 0.5 M of Na2SO4 (Sigma Aldrich) (pH = 6.1) was used as the electrolyte for all PEC measurements without any additional additives. Cyclic voltammograms were recorded using an advanced potentiostat (PGSTAT-30 from Autolab) with a scanning rate of 50 mV s−1. The photocurrent measurements were recorded using a solar simulator with a 300 W xenon arc-lamp (Hayashi- LA 251-Xe). The light intensity was calibrated using a silicon photodiode (100 mW cm−2). The electrolyte was bubbled with nitrogen gas for 30 min to avoid the presence of oxygen (electron acceptor) in the solution. The IPCE measurements were carried out by employing a 300 W Xe lamp coupled to a computer-controlled monochromator; the photoelectrode was polarized at the desired voltage (1.6 V vs. RHE) using a Gamry potentiostat, and the photocurrent was measured using an optical power meter 70310 from Oriel Instruments. A Si photodiode was used to measure the light intensity to calibrate the system. The output gas samples were collected from the head space of a sealed PEC chamber using an air-tight gas syringe through the manual sampling port in the top of the chamber (flexible cork made of Teflon) and further subjected to gas chromatographic analysis to evaluate the constituents of the gas products.
Theoretical calculations
To get insights into the binding mechanism of positively charged DMAP-capped Au NPs on TiO2 NWs and N–TiO2 NWs, it is important to estimate the binding energies in the hybrid systems. First principles based simulations provide direct evidence of interaction energies between DMAP–Au NPs and the TiO2 semiconductor, which can be used to detect the optimal binding sites and to predict the maximal affinity that a nanoparticle could attain from them. The binding characteristics in TiO2–Au and N–TiO2–Au hybrid photocatalytic systems were analyzed using first principles theory. Firstly, the binding energies between molecular DMAP and Au were estimated. It was found that the DMAP molecule strongly binds to gold with −14.01 kcal mol−1 binding energy, which could be ascribed to the high binding affinity of Au atoms towards the pyridine moieties in DMAP.
Recent studies show that the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 strongly depends on its crystal facets.31–33 Moreover, it was realized that the deposition of metal nanoparticles (Ag, Au and Pt) onto selective {101} facets of anatase TiO2 crystals with different percentages of exposed {001} and {101} facets can effectively enhance the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 in both photoreduction and photo-oxidation processes.34,35 In this line, we examined the binding nature of DMAP–Au NPs on {101} and {001} facets of TiO2. Fig. 1 shows the optimal binding sites of DMAP–Au NPs on (a) {001} facets and (b) {101} facets of TiO2. The {101} facet of TiO2 shows higher binding energy (−8.282 kcal mol−1) towards DMAP–Au NP anchoring compared to the {001} facets of TiO2 (−6.48 kcal mol−1), illustrating the higher affinity of {101} surfaces towards DMAP–Au NP anchoring. Fig. 1c shows the density of the electron cloud at the TiO2–Au hybrid electrode.

The reported excellent catalytic activity and band structure modifications of TiO2 upon nitrogen doping36–39 inspired us to investigate the effect of nitrogen doping on DMAP–Au NP binding. Fig. 1(d–f) show the binding orientations and density of electron cloud distribution in N–TiO2–Au hybrid electrodes. As anticipated, higher binding energies (−8.86 kcal mol−1) were observed for DMAP–Au NPs anchoring on N–TiO2 than on pristine TiO2 NWs (−6.48 kcal mol−1) at the {001} surface. This could be ascribed to the higher binding affinity of pyridines and Au towards nitrogen. Strikingly, the binding energies were found to be remarkably enhanced at the {101} surface of N–TiO2 NWs. The N–TiO2–Au hybrid system shows a binding energy of −35.56 kcal mol−1 at the {101} surface, which is nearly four times higher than that observed for the {001} plane of N–TiO2 NWs. This strongly suggests that the Au NPs can be effectively coated onto N–TiO2 by electrostatic attraction.
On the other hand, in view of improving the light harvesting efficiency of TiO2, Au NP decoration found to improve the visible light activity of hybrid materials owing to their strong scattering effect and enhanced absorption at around 520 nm due to the LSPR band. To understand the origin and the extent of improved visible light activity in TiO2–Au hybrid systems, the light scattering effect of Au NPs at TiO2 NWs was further analyzed using the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD). Fig. 2 shows the electric field (E-field) distribution in the perpendicular direction, across the Au NPs at the TiO2-NW surface obtained from FDTD simulations. The permittivity of gold was analyzed using the Lorenz–Drude dispersive model.40 (2)where εr(ω) is the relative permittivity at infinity frequency, Gm is the strength of each resonance term, Ωm is the plasma frequency, ω and ωm are the angular and resonant frequency, respectively, and Γm is the damping factor or collision frequency. Fig. 2(a) and (b), clearly illustrate the electric field generation around the Au NPs. The electric field extension varies with Au NP loading (spacing) on TiO2. The visible light scattering centres around Au NPs transformed the light reception at TiO2. However, higher loadings of Au NPs on TiO2 found to scatter the major portion of input light, which may reduce the light transmission reaching the TiO2 surface. Thus, it is anticipated that the TiO2–Au hybrid system benefits not only from improved LSPR band facilitated absorption at 520 nm, but also from the light scattering effect of Au NPs, which could effectively improve the light absorption properties of TiO2 itself.

Experimental results
From the above discussion, it is inferred that the Au NP decoration at TiO2 NWs could yield high PEC energy conversion efficiency, mainly through light scattering and co-catalyst effects. Moreover, nitrogen doping was found to enhance the interaction between Au NPs and TiO2 as well as the visible light activity of TiO2 by the band gap narrowing effect.39 In order to understand the role of Au NP decoration and nitrogen doping, we have designed and fabricated Au NP decorated TiO2 NW and N–TiO2 NW arrays onto fluorinated tin oxide (FTO) substrates. Fig. 3 shows the electron microscopy images of nitrided TiO2 (N–TiO2) NW, Au NP coated TiO2 NW (TiO2–Au) and N–TiO2 NW (N–TiO2–Au) arrays, respectively.

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of N–TiO2 NWs clearly reveal their vertically aligned geometry and 1-D structure (Fig. 3a). The N–TiO2 NWs have a length of ∼5 μm, an inner free space of ∼200 nm and a shell thickness of ∼50 nm, respectively (Fig. 3b). From Fig. 3c and d, a thin amorphous layer is observed on TiO2. This layer represents the formation of TiN/TiOxNy on the TiO2 NW surface during the nitridation process. Although it was difficult to obtain lattice resolved TEM images at the surface of N–TiO2 NWs, the X-ray diffraction (XRD) and SAED patterns support that N–TiO2 NWs maintain their polycrystalline anatase phase (see ESI,† Fig. S1). There are no noticeable changes in the geometry of the NWs after Au NP anchoring (Fig. 3f and j). Au NPs with an average diameter of ∼5 nm were observed in the high magnification TEM images (Fig. 3i) (also see ESI,† Fig. S2). These images (Fig. 3h and l) confirm the higher loading of Au NPs on N–TiO2 NWs compared to pristine TiO2 NWs.
The effect of nitrogen doping on TiO2 NWs was studied by X ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Fig. 4(a) shows the core spectra of Ti 2p in pristine TiO2 NWs and N–TiO2 NWs. The shoulder peaks at 459.4 eV and 465.1 eV correspond to Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2, respectively.41 In N–TiO2 NWs, these peaks were shifted toward lower binding energy indicating the successful nitrogen doping at the TiO2 NWs. Upon further examining the N 1s core spectra (Fig. 4b), the peaks at 396.8, 398.8, and 400.6 eV provide a clear picture of the nitrogen environment at TiO2 NWs. The peak at 396.8 eV is attributed to the existence of atomic β-N in the TiO2 matrix and the peak at 398.8 eV implies the substitution of O2− by nitrogen ions and thus, results in the formation of N–Ti–O.42,43 This confirms the existence of Ti3+ due to the incorporation of nitrogen atoms into oxygen lattice sites. The weaker peak at 400.6 eV indicates the interstitial doping which induces an additional impurity state above the valence band of TiO2.44 The atomic ratio of nitrogen doping carriers was estimated from Fig. 4b and found to be 5.8 wt%. The broad features of the O 1s peak in Fig. 4c were deconvoluted using the Gaussian fit (Fig. 4c, inset). Three distinct peaks were observed at 530.9, 532.2 and 533.2 eV representing the lattice oxygen, surface hydroxyl oxygen and surface adsorbed oxygen, respectively. The atomic weight of lattice oxygen at TiO2 NWs was estimated to be 51.5%, which was reduced to 47.6% upon nitrogen doping. This indicates the possibility of nitrogen atoms occupying the oxygen vacancies. The influence of nitrogen doping on the work function of TiO2 NWs was examined using ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (see ESI,† Fig. S3). The valence band maximum (VBM) position of TiO2 NWs at ∼3.26 eV was shifted to ∼2.69 eV upon nitrogen doping. This indicates that nitrogen doping carriers are creating sub-bands or defects above the VB of TiO2 as discussed in the XPS results.

In order to study the contribution of DMAP–Au NPs towards the visible light activity of TiO2–Au and N–TiO2–Au hybrid photocatalysts, diffuse reflectance measurements were performed. The results are shown in Fig. 5a. The Kubelka–Munk absorbance contribution of TiO2 NWs and N–TiO2 NWs was subtracted from the absorbance spectrum of TiO2–Au and N–TiO2–Au hybrids, respectively (Fig. 5b). Both spectra confirm the enhanced scattering induced by the presence of Au NPs, being the LSPR effect negligible for these specimens. Although, Au NP coating at TiO2 and N–TiO2 was carried out under identical conditions, N–TiO2–Au hybrid electrodes showed higher absorbance, indicating higher loading of Au NPs in good correspondence with the TEM measurements (Fig. 2h and l) and the Kubelka–Munk function (F.R.) (inset of Fig. 5). This is attributed to the higher binding energy observed at the N–TiO2 surfaces. The broad absorption nature of N–TiO2–Au may be originated from the light scattering effect which amplifies the absorbance of TiO2.45

To test the photoelectrochemical (PEC) water oxidation performance, we measured J–V characteristics of these electrodes under the dark and illumination conditions. From Fig. 6a, it was found that the TiO2–Au hybrid electrode showed four times higher photocurrent ∼0.4 mA cm−2 than the pristine TiO2 NW electrode (0.11 mA cm−2). This photocurrent enhancement may be due to the combined effect of higher optical absorption due to the scattering and co-catalytic effect of Au NPs in water oxidation through the formation of the Au–TiO2 Schottky junction.46,47 In addition, it may facilitate the charge separation at TiO2/electrolyte interfaces and thus reduces the recombination of electrons through surface states of TiO2.48 In the case of nitrogen doping at TiO2 NWs, the photocurrent density was slightly enhanced (0.22 mA cm−2), which might be ascribed to the promotion of visible light activity of TiO2 through the band gap narrowing effect (see ESI,† S3 and S4).
 Fig. 6  
J–V results of PEC water splitting using different photoanode electrodes. Note that two different Au concentrations were used for decorating working electrodes: (low – 0.34 × 10−7 M; high – 3.4 × 10−7 M). 
In striking contrast, the photocurrent in the N–TiO2–Au hybrid system was only slightly higher than that in the N–TiO2 NW system. This might be due to excessive Au NP decoration (from Fig. 3l), which may result in forward light scattering blocking the light photons reaching the N–TiO2 NW surface and also reduce the interfacial contact between N–TiO2 and FTO electrodes, thus hindering the photoholes participating in the water oxidation process.18 This implies that there exists a trade-off between the enhanced light scattering due to Au NP decoration and visible light photon reception at N–TiO2 NWs, which necessitates the optimization of Au NP loading onto N–TiO2 NWs. We have recently reported that the photoelectrochemical performance of TiO2–Au nanocomposites has a volcano dependence with Au loading.28
Interestingly, the Au NP decorated TiO2 and N–TiO2 electrodes using low concentration stock solution (0.34 × 10−7 M), here referred to as TiO2–Au (low) and N–TiO2–Au (low), respectively, lead to higher photocurrent compared to the high Au concentration samples, as observed in Fig. 6. This photocurrent enhancement strongly suggests minimizing the optical blocking effect through controlling the Au NP loading on N–TiO2.
Furthermore, the stability of electrodes in photocurrent generation is examined with chronoamperometric curves (see ESI,† S5). The significant decrease of the photocurrent in both TiO2 and TiO2–Au electrodes may be attributed to the current leakage at TiO2/FTO interfaces to the electrolyte through the naked FTO surface (uncovered TiO2 area). Another plausible reason may arise from Au stability under long time photo-irradiation. However it is not clear at this moment and further research on this topic is needed. It is anticipated that inserting a compact TiO2 blocking layer between TiO2 and FTO layers will hinder the electron flow from the charge collector to the electrolyte.
In order to further corroborate the absence of the plasmonic effect at Au coated TiO2 electrodes, we recorded IPCE spectra (see ESI,† Fig. S6). There is no photocurrent peak at around 550 nm in the TiO2–Au electrode as observed in optical absorption spectra (Fig. 5b). This implies that there is no electron injection from Au nanoparticles to TiO2 by the plasmonic effect. Instead, Au NPs are promoting the optical absorption of TiO2 through the scattering effect. In addition, Au NPs play a critical role as a co-catalyst in the water oxidation process as shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†). The photoholes generated at the valence band of TiO2 and N–TiO2 are injected into Au NPs and may oxidize the water molecules into oxygen and protons.
Aiming at the technological exploitation of the photocurrent enhancement due to nitrogen doping and loading of Au nanoparticles, we carried out the deposition of these structures on flexible stainless steel (SS) substrates. The flexible photoelectrodes are highly promising in solar-to hydrogen fuel production owing to their lower weight and cost, compared to FTO, together with more versatile mechanical properties. However, the TiO2 nanowire fabrication onto flexible SS substrates remains challenging. A similar deposition procedure of TiO2 on FTO substrates explained in the Experimental section was repeated for fabricating TiO2 NWs on flexible SS substrates. We adopt the optimized Au NP concentration condition (0.34 × 10−7 M) from Fig. 6, and reconstructed the TiO2–Au hybrid systems onto flexible stainless steel (SS) substrates instead of FTO substrates (the sample photo is presented in the inset of Fig. 7a).

The J–V characteristics of Au–TiO2–SS and N–TiO2–Au–SS electrodes were tested in the 0.5 M Na2SO4 aqueous electrolyte with a three electrode PEC cell step up. The J–V characteristic of N–TiO2–Au–SS is displayed in Fig. 7a. The higher photocurrent density achieved in N–TiO2–Au–SS compared to the TiO2–Au–SS electrode agrees well with the trends presented in Fig. 6. The scattering effect by Au NPs, the band gap narrowing effect by N doping and catalysis at optimal concentration lead to high photocurrent generation at the N–TiO2–Au–SS sample. A small onset potential shift occurred in this sample towards the negative potential region, also in good agreement with the results shown in Fig. 6. We believe that this cathodic shift can be related to enhanced charge collection at the contact for the N–doped TiO2.
The gas evolution from the PEC water oxidation experiment was collected for one hour under light illumination at 1 V vs. RHE potential, and analysed using gas chromatography (Fig. 7b). It is observed that TiO2–Au–SS hybrid electrodes could generate hydrogen of about 120 μmol h−1 cm−2. Interestingly, the hydrogen generated at N–TiO2–Au–SS hybrid electrodes was about 270 μmol h−1 cm−2. The described bendable architecture of N–TiO2–Au on SS substrates (inset of Fig. 7a) with light weight and low cost can be beneficial for large scale flexible PEC fuel generation.49,50 Another advantage of both side conducting nature of SS substrates enables us to design an artificial leaf based (back side coated with the electrocatalyst) on monolithic wireless type solar fuel cells.51
Conclusions
Hybrid photocatalytic systems developed by anchoring DMAP–Au NPs on N–TiO2 nanowires exhibit interesting optical and photocatalytic properties for water oxidation. Nitrogen doping of TiO2 both maximizes the DMAP–Au NP loading and improves the optical absorption due to the band narrowing effect. DMAP–Au NP anchoring amplifies the visible light activity of TiO2 and N–TiO2via a light scattering effect and also improves the charge recombination at the electrode/electrolyte interface. After optimization of the Au loading on the nanostructured photoelectrodes, N-doped TiO2 leads to enhanced photocurrent generation and slightly more favourable onset potential on both FTO and SS substrates. Hydrogen generation measured on films deposited on flexible SS substrates was significantly higher on N-doped TiO2 nanostructures.
