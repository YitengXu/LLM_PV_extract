    , Accepted 6th October 2022First published on 7th October 2022AbstractFlexible perovskite solar cells (F-PSCs) have attracted enormous attention in portable and wearable electronics due to their low-cost and high power-per-weight. However, there is still much room for development with respect to the moisture and mechanical stability of F-PSCs, which prevents their final commercialization. Herein, we report a new self-healing, high-efficiency F-PSC that incorporates a host–guest in situ synthesized ter-polymer as a self-healing unit and a 2D/3D heterostructure perovskite as a moisture shielding and passivation layer. Consequently, the strategy not only offers decent efficiencies of 23.06% on rigid substrates and over 20% on flexible substrates, but also improves the mechanical stability of F-PSCs, that is, ∼90% of the original efficiency could be recovered after self-healing during 4000 bending cycles. This solution addresses the stability concern of F-PSCs and other applications and represents an important step for large-scale production.
Introduction
Flexible perovskite solar cells (F-PSCs) have experienced a rapid development over the past 10 years due to their light weight, roll-to-roll compatible production and potential applications in wearable and portable electronics.1–3 Through the optimization of flexible substrates and electrodes, perovskite composition engineering, charge transport materials, and interfaces, their power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) have dramatically increased over 22%.4–8 However, this efficiency is still lagging behind those of PSCs based on rigid substrates, most importantly the mechanical stability is not good enough to support the long-term working of F-PSCs with repeated bending and straightening. 2D/3D perovskite heterostructures, combining the superior moisture stability of 2D perovskites and the outstanding optoelectronic properties of 3D perovskites, are a possible solution to obtain high efficiency and stable F-PSCs.9–11 By introducing spacer molecules, it is reported that the crystallization and the defect state of perovskite films could be improved simultaneously.12,13 Nevertheless, the redundant spacer molecules can diffuse and drift throughout the perovskite films, resulting in an unstable trigger.14,15
Many attempts have been made for enhancing the mechanical stability of F-PSCs. Interfacial treatments and introducing polymer additives are good options for F-PSCs,16,17 which have significantly enhanced their mechanical stability to a certain extent, only 30% PCE degradation after 5000 bending cycles.18 Besides, introducing self-healing capability is a promising strategy when inevitable cracks are generated.19 For example, Chen et al. have combined a dynamic covalent oxime-based carbamate structure in polyurethane (PU) to provide a thermal annealing (100 °C) induced self-healing framework for perovskite crystals without compromising the PCE.20 A similar idea has also been applied by using a functional polymer binder (AD-23), partially repairing the broken perovskite grain boundary cracks by heat-activated high-density hydrogen bonding.21
In this paper, we introduce a self-healing system into F-PSCs by utilizing the moisture-driven host–guest interaction between β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) and adamantane (AA) groups, and an in-situ polymerization method. In addition, a spacer molecule for 2D/3D perovskite, methacrylguanidine hydrochloride (MAGH), has also been incorporated into the cross-linking polymer to further improve the efficiency of devices (Fig. 1a). With this ter-polymer, the 2D/3D PSCs have achieved an improved PCE, ca. > 23%, compared with the control device (PCE = 20.81%). Moreover, the mechanical stability has been enormously enhanced, that is, cracks at perovskite grain boundaries caused by 4000 bending cycles at a 6.25 mm bending radius were successfully self-healed, and the PCE recovered to 90% of the original efficiency.

Results and discussion
Synthesis and morphology
The self-healing 2D/3D perovskite was synthesized by mixing MAGH, glycidyl methacrylate-bonded β-cyclodextrin (GMA-CD) and N-adamantylacrylamide (N-AA) (Fig. 1b) ternary prepolymer (TPP) in the Cs0.05(MA0.11FA0.89)0.95Pb(I0.97Br0.03)3 precursor solution, followed by thermal annealing at 100 °C. The concentration of TPP was tuned from 0.1, 0.5, 1, 2, to 5 mg mL−1, and the corresponding perovskite films were denoted as TPP-0.1, TPP-0.5, TPP-1, TPP-2, and TPP-5, with a blank (TPP-0) as the reference. The detailed synthesis and perovskite film fabrication procedures are listed in the ESI.†
The morphologies of the obtained perovskite films have been investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). With increasing concentration of TPP, the average grain size on perovskite films gradually increases from 341 nm to 763 nm (Fig. 1c and S12†), along with the formation of a highly crystalline and monolithic perovskite as indicated by the cross-sectional SEM images in Fig. S13.† Due to the in situ polymerization of TPP during the thermal annealing process, the polymerized TPP is clearly shown at the grain boundaries (Fig. 1d), which is also confirmed by the disappearance of the CC stretching vibration peak (1652 cm−1) of TPP after annealing (Fig. S14†).22,23
Formation of 2D/3D perovskite
To detect the interaction between MAGH and PbI2, the 1H NMR spectrum of mixed MAGH and PbI2 was recorded. As indicated in Fig. 2a, a strong NH⋯I hydrogen bonding interaction between the guanidine group in MAGH and octahedral [PbI6]4− was identified from the split and shifted proton signal of the –C(NH2)+ group in MAGH, ca. chemical shift at 8.63 and 8.43 ppm, compared with the single signal at 8.19 ppm in pure MAGH. Meanwhile, a redshift of the stretching vibration of N–H in Fourier transform infrared spectra (FT-IR, Fig. S15†) when PbI2 was added has also confirmed the hydrogen bond between the guanidine group of MAGH and [PbI6]4− octahedra.24 For the interaction between PbI2 and GMA-CD, a high-field shifted proton signal and red-shifted IR absorption peaks of the –OH group in GMA-CD with the addition of PbI2 suggested a similar hydrogen bond, whereas, no obvious interaction between N-AA and PbI2 can be distinguished from NMR and FTIR spectra (Fig. S16 and S17†).

(c) GIWAXS patterns of perovskite films. (d–f) HRTEM of perovskite films with control TPP-0 (d), TPP-0.5 (e) and TPP-5 (f), insets show the corresponding FFT analysis images and the d-spacing. 
Subsequently, X-ray diffraction (XRD) was conducted to examine the phase of the perovskite films. From the XRD spectra in Fig. 2b, it is observed that TPP-0 has a pure α-phase, while the increase of the TPP concentration significantly enhances the crystallinity, which is consistent with the observed morphologies from the SEM images. More importantly, when the concentration of TPP was increased to 5 mg mL−1, a new diffraction peak at 5.97° was observed. Hence, we utilize grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) to identify its crystal structure and orientation. As illustrated in Fig. 2c, compared with TPP-0, a new weak diffraction ring with qz = 0.44 Å−1, corresponding to the new peak in XRD, was observed in the TPP-5 film, which is considered coming from the formation of a 2D perovskite with MAGH as the spacer.25,26
Simultaneously, the XRD diffraction peak at 11.8° and the GIWAXS diffraction peak with qz = 0.89 Å−1 suggested the in-plane orientation of the thin δ-phase perovskite, which was ascribed to the disruption of the 3D perovskite structure by excess TPP.11 Furthermore, to reveal the crystal structure of the perovskite with low TPP concentration, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) was performed based on TPP-0, TPP-0.5 and TPP-5. As illustrated in Fig. 2d, by fast Fourier transform (FFT) analysis, the 3.2 Å interplanar spacing in the TPP-0 film agrees well with the representative 3D (200) perovskite phase,27,28 whereas, a large interplanar spacing (7.4 Å) for TPP-0.5 and TPP-5, corresponding to the 2D perovskite lattice, is obviously shown in Fig. 2e and f. This is further evidenced by the XRD patterns of the pure 2D (MAGH)2PbI4 perovskite (Fig. S18 and Table S1†), which exhibits a diffraction peak (002) according to a d-spacing of 7.4 Å. Taking the same electron diffraction patterns of TPP-0, TPP-0.5 and TPP-5 into account, the crystal structure of TPP-0.5 should be 2D/3D (Fig. S19†). Besides, from HR-TEM, the amorphous organic polymers were also found encapsulating the perovskite crystals, consistent with the cross-sectional SEM images. In summary, the introduction of un-polymerized MAGH at the A site is intended to form a 2D/3D heterogeneous perovskite for improving the quality of the perovskite films. Moreover, the aim of the introduction of the polymerized MAGH at the perovskite grain boundary is to form a 3D supramolecular network and localize all these molecules, GMA-CD and N-AA, for improving the self-healing properties via the synergistic effect of host–guest interaction and hydrogen bonds.
Optoelectronic properties
The effect of 2D/3D perovskite heterostructure and the host–guest polymer on optical and electronic properties was evaluated. From UV-vis absorption spectra and Tauc plots of various perovskite films in Fig. 3a, when TPP was added, a small blue shift of the absorption band was observed due to the formation of the 2D/3D heterostructure, leading to the widening of the optical band gap.

The carrier kinetics throughout the perovskite films was analyzed by steady state and time-resolved photoluminescence (PL and TRPL) spectroscopy. From the PL spectra of perovskite films in Fig. 3b, it is seen that the PL intensity exhibits a rising and falling trend when slowly increasing the quantity of polymer, which may be caused by the competition between defect passivation and the insulating effect.29,30 Simultaneously, the removal of low-lying trap states in the TPP-0.5 perovskite film has also led to a gradually obvious blue-shifted PL peak, from 802 to 798 nm, while the average carrier lifetime obtained from the corresponding TRPL spectra in Fig. 3c is 1743.92 ns for TPP-0.5, significantly longer than that of the TPP-0 film (175.76 ns) (Table S2, ESI†), which is related to the passivation of the non-radiative recombination, possibly caused by the reduced deep-level defects when the appropriate quantity of ter-polymer was introduced.31–33
Further, the surface chemical state of the perovskite films was investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). In Fig. 3d, the peaks at 138.3 and 143.2 eV were identified as Pb2+4f7/2 and Pb2+4f5/2, respectively, and the two weak peaks at 135.7 eV and 140.5 eV are ascribed to the metallic Pb0.34 Moreover, it is noteworthy that these two weak peaks disappeared in TPP-0.5 and TPP-2, suggesting the as-expected suppression of Pb0 deep energy level defects created by halide vacancies.35
The trap density (Nt) of the perovskite films was then calculated by space charge limited current (SCLC) as depicted in Fig. 3e and f.4,36 Hole-only devices with the structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/perovskite/Spiro-OMeTAD/Ag were fabricated, and the Nt of the TPP-0.5 was determined to be 4.68 × 1015 cm−3, lower than that of the control film (7.30 × 1015 cm−3). Similarly, the Nt values of the TPP-0.5 and TPP-0 estimated from the electron-only devices with the configuration of ITO/SnO2/perovskite/PCBM/Ag were 5.60 × 1015 cm−3 and 1.01 × 1016 cm−3. Thereby, by adding ter-polymer into the perovskite, the trap density has been significantly mitigated, which could favour the overall photovoltaic performance of PSCs.32
Photovoltaic performance
We have hence fabricated PSCs with a planar n–i–p structure, FTO/SnO2/perovskite/Spiro-OMeTAD/Ag, and recorded the J–V curves under standard simulated AM 1.5G 100 mW cm−2 light. Fig. 4a and S20† show the device performances based on 20 independent devices with different TPP concentrations, and the specific photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table S3†. The average PCEs based on TPP-0 and best TPP-0.5 were 20.34% and 22.50%, respectively, with an obviously improved FF in TPP-0.5 based devices. Among those, TPP-0.5 based devices exhibited a narrower PCE distribution, demonstrating their better reproducibility.

(c) Steady-state PCE and JSC of champion control TPP-0 and TPP-0.5 PSCs. (d) Nyquist plots of the PSCs based on TPP-0 and TPP-0.5. (e) VOC dependence on light intensity for the TPP-0 and TPP-0.5 PSCs. (f) Long-term stability of unencapsulated PSCs upon storage in air (RH = 20–30%). 
Derived from the J–V curve for the best device based on TPP-0.5 in Fig. 4b, a champion efficiency of 23.06% was achieved, with a JSC of 24.36 mA cm−2, VOC of 1.17 V, and FF of 80.95%, while the control TPP-0 device gave a PCE of 20.81%, with a JSC of 23.95 mA cm−2, VOC of 1.15 V, and FF of 75.68%. The device performance was then confirmed by external quantum efficiency (EQE) in Fig. S21,† where the integrated JSC values were 22.65 and 23.04 mA cm−2 for TPP-0 and TPP-0.5 based devices, respectively, in agreement with the values from the J–V curves (∼95%). Fig. 4c shows the steady-state output photocurrent and efficiency at the maximum power point under constant 1-sun illumination over 180 s. The PCEs of the TPP-0 and TPP-0.5 devices were stable at 19.49% and 21.72%, respectively.
Further, the origin of the enhanced performance was investigated by fabricating PSCs based on each pure polymer of MAGH, GMA-CD, and N-AA. As displayed in Fig. S22–S24 and Table S4–S6†, by changing the concentration, MAGH has a great influence on device performance, especially compared with GMA-CD and N-AA. Among them, when GMA-CD was added at 0.01 mg mL−1, the device efficiency increased from 20.06% to 21.31%, which could be attributed to the passivation of perovskite grain boundary defects by the formation of hydrogen bonds between the hydroxyl groups in GMA-CD and [PbI6]4− (Fig. S16†). In contrast, different concentrations of N-AA barely affected the PCE of devices. Hence, the MAGH induced formation of the 2D/3D heterostructure and passivation of defects contribute the major part in PCE improvement.
The charge transport kinetics of PSCs were investigated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) as shown in Fig. 4d. The Nyquist plots were fitted to an equivalent circuit. A smaller arc in the high frequency region and low frequency region corresponds to a smaller charge transfer resistance (Rtr, 3358 vs. 7741 Ω), demonstrating an efficient charge transport process in the TPP-0.5 based device.37,38
The VOC dependence on light intensity was recorded, and Fig. 4e shows the semi-natural logarithmic plot of VOC as a function of light intensity for PSCs with TPP-0 and TPP-0.5. The derived slopes for devices were 1.52 kT/q and 1.22 kT/q, accordingly, revealing a suppression of trap-assisted Shockley–Read–Hall (SRH) recombination with TPP-0.5. Thus, together with the EIS and SCLC results, the decrease of the non-radiative recombination is the main reason for the enhanced PCE in TPP-0.5 derived PSCs, which also explains the improved FF in J–V curves.
On account of the reported better stability of 2D perovskite materials, it is necessary to investigate the device stability based on TPP-0.5. As illustrated in Fig. 4f, the PCE of the control device decayed to ∼56% after 1000 hours at a relative humidity (RH) of 20–30%, in sharp contrast to the nearly 99% maintained efficiency for PSCs based on TPP-0.5. By further increasing the RH to 60–70%, the un-encapsulated device can still maintain 87% of the initial efficiency after 1000 hours (Fig. S25†), while after XRD examination of the degradative perovskite films, the PbI2 peaks can be barely seen for TPP-0.5 after 35 days of storage (Fig. S26†). Therefore, the formed 2D/3D heterostructure along with the ter-polymer surely protects the perovskite films from moisture intrusion into the crystal grains.
Self-healing properties
On the other hand, the host–guest interaction between GMA-CD and N-AA offered the possibility of self-healing in the cracked perovskite films; the schematic of the self-healing is shown in Fig. 5a.39 The host–guest molecule interaction could heal or repair the cracked perovskite film. We have thereby fabricated n–i–p type flexible PSCs (F-PSCs) based on polyethylene naphthalate (PEN) substrates. Firstly, compared to the control device with a PCE of 18.69%, the champion efficiency of F-PSCs based on TPP-0.5 was as high as 20.46% (Fig. 5b). Then, the F-PSCs were subjected to constant bending at a curvature of 6.25 mm, as shown in Fig. 5c. For the control device, after 2000 bending cycles, it retained merely 60% of the initial efficiency, while for the device based on TPP-0.5, even after prolonging the bending cycles to 4000, yet more than 85% of the initial efficiency was retained.

(f) Height curves extracted from (d and e). (g and h) AFM images of cracks in TPP-0.5 perovskite films and after self-healing treatment. (i) Height curves extracted from (g and h). 
By checking the optical images of the perovskite films before and after bending 1000 cycles, many obvious cracks can be observed in the control film, whereas only slight crack traces can be seen for TPP-0.5 (Fig. S27, ESI†), demonstrating that TPP is a flexible support framework to improve the flexibility. These slight cracks can weaken the carrier transport and provide new recombination centers, explaining the drop of PCE, ca. ∼15%, during continuous bending cycles.40
In order to initiate the self-healing process by the host–guest interaction between GMA-CD and N-AA, the cracked perovskite films were stored at 60–70% RH for 4 h. Clearly, the cracks in TPP-0.5 were healed while there was no change for TPP-0 in SEM images (Fig. S28, ESI†). Simultaneously, the bulk polymer sample was cut, followed by the self-healing process under the same conditions (Fig. S29, ESI†). From the dye diffusion and loading test, it can be concluded that the self-healed polymer is robust enough.
Furthermore, atomic function microscopy (AFM) was utilized to in situ probe the self-healing process. As shown in Fig. 5d–i, the cracks formed in TPP-0 are as wide as ∼200 nm, while the cracks in TPP-0.5 are much narrower, ca. 100 nm. Moreover, despite having the same morphology of TPP-0, the self-healed TPP-0.5 film hardly shows any cracks in the AFM image.
To demonstrate the self-healing effect in F-PSCs, the devices after 4000 bending cycles were treated in an environment at 60–70% RH. It is interesting to observe that the PCE of devices based on TPP-0.5 has recovered more than 90% of their initial efficiency, while the healing treatment showed no positive influence on the device based on TPP-0 due to the more exposure to moisture induced by the formed cracks. We consider that the recovery of PCE comes from both the self-healing cracks and the tight polymer encapsulation around the perovskite crystal thanks to the formation of hydrogen bonds. The applications of self-healing materials in PSCs are summarized in Table S7†. Compared with them, the self-healing PSCs based on host–guest interaction have excellent self-healing performance with promising application.
Conclusions
In summary, we have in situ synthesized a ter-polymer to construct host–guest interaction between GMA-CD and N-AA and a 2D/3D heterostructure by incorporating MAGH. With this ter-polymer, PSCs achieved a PCE of 23.06% on rigid substrates and over 20% on flexible substrates. More importantly, the cracked perovskite films in F-PSCs can self-heal with this ter-polymer and the efficiency can recover to ∼90% of the original PCE, leading to a longer lifetime for the overall F-PSCs. Therefore, the synergetic effect between the 2D/3D heterostructure and the guest–host interaction in the ter-polymer, enabling high-efficiency and self-healing F-PSCs, provides a new promising avenue for durable flexible devices, such as portable and wearable photovoltaics.
