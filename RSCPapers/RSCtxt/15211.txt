    , Accepted 3rd July 2016First published on 4th July 2016AbstractCobalt dithiolene complexes are a new class of H2-evolving catalysts. Here we describe the preparation, the structure and the catalytic activity of an original cobalt complex using a bioinspired ligand, a quinoxaline–pyran-fused dithiolene derivative (qpdt2−) that mimics the molybdopterin cofactor present in the active sites of formate dehydrogenases. This complex displays very good activity for electrochemical proton reduction under weak acid conditions in terms of turnover frequency, faradic yields and stability. Density functional theory calculations show that protonation of a nitrogen atom of the ligand decreases overpotentials by 520 mV and H2 formation proceeds via protonation of an intermediate Co–H hydride, with an adjacent S atom of the dithiolene ligand serving as a proton relay.
1. Introduction
Storage of diluted and intermittent sources of energy such as solar and wind energy is a great challenge of the 21st century. It can be accomplished by the conversion of electricity or light into chemical energy. For example, the production of hydrogen, a clean energy vector, can be achieved through the electrolysis of water. Currently, platinum has shown the best activity but is one of the most expensive metals, with very limited abundance. For this reason, many novel non-noble metal complexes and materials have been studied as catalysts for hydrogen production in the past decade.1–7
Designing new catalysts by a biomimetic approach is particularly appealing. For hydrogen production, hydrogenases are an exquisite source of inspiration and their active sites have been extensively mimicked leading to interesting and original H2 evolution molecular catalysts.8–10 However, there are other biological systems that have enjoyed less attention so far, such as W/Mo-containing oxido-reductases that catalyze a variety of redox reactions.11,12 The active site of these enzymes has a single Mo or W ion coordinated by one or two molybdopterin (MPT, Fig. 1) ligand(s).13 This cofactor is composed of a fused pyranopterin system and a dithiolene moiety, a redox non-innocent chelate. Moreover the sulfur atoms can be protonated and thus may serve as proton relays.14,15 While numerous dithiolene metal complexes have been described,16 the exploitation of that class of compounds as hydrogen evolution catalysts is quite recent. A pioneering work was achieved by Eisenberg and co-workers with cobalt-dithiolene complexes.17,18 The catalytic mechanism of proton reduction by these systems has been studied by Solis and Hammes-Schiffer.15 They showed, through DFT calculations, the key role of sulfur atoms as proton-exchange sites. Recently, Letko et al. described a series of cobalt−diaryldithiolene complexes active for the reduction of protons to hydrogen.19 Based on a combined electrochemical studies and DFT calculations, they highlighted the strong electronic interplay between the metal center and dithiolene ligand for H2 evolution occurring through a diprotonated intermediate with a Co–H bond and a protonated S center.

As part of a program to find catalysts for the reduction of protons based on non-precious metals, we have successfully evaluated some W−dioxo and one Mo−oxo bisdithiolene complexes.20,21 In the latter case, a bioinspired ligand, a quinoxaline–pyran-fused dithiolene derivative (L = qpdt2−, Fig. 1) that mimics the molybdopterin cofactor present in the active sites of formate dehydrogenases, was developed.22 Herein, we report the synthesis and characterization of the cobalt complex with the same qpdt2− ligand. The ability of this complex to perform proton electroreduction under weak acid conditions and photoreduction has been addressed. Density functional theory calculations were used to provide insights into the reaction mechanism for the generation of H2 by the [CoIII(qpdt)2]− catalyst.
2. Experimental
General considerations
All reagents and solvents were used as received unless otherwise specified. Aqueous solutions were prepared with doubly deionized water with resistivity not less than 18.2 MΩ cm−1. Anhydrous acetonitrile (CH3CN), tetra-n-butylammonium perchlorate, tris(2,2′-bipyridyl)-dichlororuthenium(II) hexahydrate, ascorbic acid, and acetic acid were purchased by Sigma-Aldrich and used as received. The synthesis of the deprotected qpdt2− ligand (1, Fig. 1) has been described previously.22
UV-vis spectra were recorded using a Cary 100 UV-vis spectrophotometer instrument (Agilent). Mass spectrometry analysis, electrospray Q-TOF (ES Q-TOF MS), was performed on a Q-star instrument (Applied Biosystem).
Synthesis of (Et4N)2[CoIII(qpdt)2]2 (2)
The deprotection step was carried out under Ar using Schlenk tubes and all solutions were degassed prior to use. tBuOK (448 mg, 3.99 mmol) was added to a solution of 1 (475 mg, 0.998 mmol) in anhydrous THF (10 mL) at 0 °C. After 30 min at room temperature, a solution of Co(ClO4)2·6H2O (182.6 mg, 0.499 mmol) in MeOH (10 mL) was added dropwise through a cannula to the dark red suspension. An immediate color change to black was observed. After 1 h, the solution was opened to air, Et4NCl (166 mg, 1 mmol) was added and the dark brown solution was kept at room temperature for 3 h. H2O (15 mL) was added and organic solvents were evaporated. The resulting dark brown precipitate was filtered, washed with water and dried under vacuum. The crude product was purified by flash chromatography over silica gel by eluting with MeOH/CH2Cl2 (1/99). Recrystallization from CH2Cl2/pentane afforded a dark brown solid (102 mg, 28%). UV-Vis (CH3CN), λmax nm (ε, M−1 cm−1): 831 (8070), 371 (47800), 296 (44800); negative-ion electrospray MS (CH3CN) m/z: 606.98 ([Co(qpdt)2]−) and 1213.95 ([Co(qpdt)2]2−); Anal. Calcd for C73H90Cl10Co2N10O4S8 (2·5CH2Cl2, 1900.4767): C 46.13, H 4.77, N 7.37, S 13.50; Found: C 46.09, H 4.84, N 7.59, S 14.31. Single crystals suitable for X-ray diffraction were obtained by layering pentane over a CH2Cl2 solution containing the crude complex at room temperature.
Electrochemistry
All cyclic voltammetry (CVs) experiments were performed in a conventional three-electrode single-compartment cell with a SP 300 Bio-Logic potentiostat (Bio-Logic Science Instruments SAS). A Pt wire was used as counter electrode and a saturated Ag/AgCl/KCl electrode separated from the solution by a salt bridge as reference electrode. Glassy carbon electrode (GCE) of 1 mm or 3 mm diameter were used as working electrodes. GCEs were polished on wet polishing cloth using a 1 μm diamond suspension and a 0.05 μm alumina slurry. Solutions of acetonitrile containing 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium perchlorate (TBAP) as the supporting electrolyte were bulk deaerated with Ar for at least 15 min before CVs. Bulk electrolysis experiments were carried out in a custom-built, gas-tight two-compartment electrochemical cell specific for mercury that separates the cathode and anode compartments via a porous glass frit of fine porosity. Electrolysis was conducted at room temperature. The working electrode was a pool of 0.5 mL of mercury, the counter electrode was a 0.5 mm diameter platinum wire and the reference electrode was a saturated Ag/AgCl/KCl electrode. Bulk electrolysis was conducted using a range of concentrations of catalysts (0.1–1 mM) and 100 mM acetic acid (AcOH) containing 0.1 M TBAP in acetonitrile. The solutions were purged with N2 gas for 15 min and constantly stirred. Faradaic yields were calculated by measuring the H2 produced in the headspace of the electrolysis cell (28.8 mL) with a gas chromatograph coupled to a thermal conductivity detector (Shimadzu GC-2014). Aliquots of gas were removed with a gas-tight syringe.
Photochemical experiments
Stock solutions of [Ru(bpy)3]Cl2 (2.22 mM) and complex 2 (0.1 mM) were prepared in CH3CN:TEOA (7:2) and dry CH3CN, respectively. Various amounts of [Ru(bpy)3]Cl2, catalysts and solvent (CH3CN) were added to obtain a total volume of 1 mL. The samples were sealed with a septum, degassed in N2 for 5 min, and finally placed into a temperature-controlled block at 20 °C. The cuvettes were irradiated with a Xenon Light Source 300 W with a 410–1200 nm long wave pass filter (Asahi Spectra). The light power was adjusted to 180 W. During irradiation, the headspace of the vials was analyzed by gas chromatography (Shimadzu GC-2014) with a thermal conductivity detector and a Quadrex column and was quantified according to a calibration curve.
X-ray structure determination

A single crystal of the compound was selected, mounted onto a cryoloop, and transferred in a cold nitrogen gas stream. Intensity data were collected with a BRUKER Kappa-APEXII diffractometer with a microfocus Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 1.54178 Å). Data collection was performed on a twinned crystal with APEX2 suite (BRUKER). Unit-cell parameters were first determined with CELL_NOW, integration and data reduction were carried out with SAINT program (BRUKER). TWINABS (BRUKER) was used for scaling and multi-scan absorption corrections.
In the WinGX suite of programs,23 the structure was solved with SUPERFLIP24 program and refined by full-matrix least-squares methods using SHELXL-14.25 All non-hydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically. Hydrogen atoms were placed at calculated positions. CCDC 1475024 contains the supplementary crystallographic data.
Computational methods
All geometries were fully optimized at the B3P8626,27/6-311+G(d,p)28,29 level of density functional theory (DFT) using the Gaussian 09 program30 and the SMD implicit-solvation model (ε = 35.688 for acetonitrile).31 Unrestricted Kohn–Sham formalism was used to explore the spin multiplicity of the investigated adducts. Several possible intermediates have electronic structures that are not well described by a single determinant, and thus not readily treated by the standard Kohn–Sham density functional formalism. The Yamaguchi broken-spin-symmetry (BS) procedure32 was used to compute the energy of the spin-purified low-spin (LS) state as:  where HS refers to the single-determinant high-spin state and 〈S2〉 is the expectation value of the total spin operator. The nature of all stationary points was verified by analytic computation of vibrational frequencies, which were used for the computation of zero-point vibrational energies and molecular partition functions for use in computing 298.15 K thermal contributions to free energy employing the usual rigid-rotator harmonic oscillator approximation.33 Reduction potentials were calculated using the relation , where n is the number of transferring electrons, F is Faraday's constant, ΔG° is the free energy of reduction, calculated for structures optimized in solution, and  is the absolute reduction potential of the reference species, (in this work, the ferrocenium/ferrocene couple (Fc+/Fc)) computed at the same level of theory. The thus obtained reduction potentials were then converted to the Ag/AgCl/KCl electrode by applying a shift of 0.5 V.34 The proton solvation energy is taken to be −260.2 kcal mol−1 in acetonitrile.35
3. Results and discussion
Synthesis
The protected dithiolene derivative 1, previously described, was treated with tBuOK under anaerobic conditions to generate the dithiolene ligand qpdt2−. Without purification, the latter was then reacted with Co(ClO4)2·2H2O followed by a cation exchange step with Et4NCl, to afford the dinuclear complex (Et4N)2[CoIII(qpdt)2]2 (2) which can be isolated in 26% yield (Fig. 1). At variance with the molybdenum(IV)−oxo complex [MoIVO(qpdt)2]2−,21 complex 2 is air stable and could be purified by chromatography over silica gel.
Structural analysis
Single crystals suitable for X-ray diffraction were isolated by layering a CH2Cl2 solution of complex 2 with pentane. A summary of the crystal data collection and refinement parameters are listed in Table S1.† Selected interatomic bond lengths and angles are listed in Table S2.† An ORTEP diagram of the anionic part of 2 is shown in Fig. 2.

Complex 2 crystallizes in the monoclinic system and the unit cell includes four dinuclear complexes and eight Et4N+ ions. The dimer consists of two [CoIII(qpdt)2]− units which are associated through two apical Co–S coordination bonds, between one Co atom of one unit and one sulfur atom of the other unit. Furthermore, within one unit the two ligands are cis-oriented while the ligands of one unit are trans-oriented with respect to those of the second unit. Steric hindrance probably prevents the ligands from stacking against each other. In contrast, the mononuclear (Bu4N)2[MoIVO(qpdt)2] has its two qpdt2− ligands trans-orientated.21 In each monomer, the cobalt cation is thus penta-coordinated in a S5 environment with a distorted square based pyramidal geometry. The cobalt atoms are located 0.269(1) Å above the average plane of the four basal sulfur atoms. The Co⋯Co distance in the dimer is 3.1012(14) Å. As expected, the apical Co–S lengths of 2.367(2) and 2.358(2) Å, respectively for Co1 and Co2 are longer than the average basal Co–S bond lengths of 2.191(2) Å for both Co. These values are comparable to those previously reported for dimeric Co–(dithiolene)2 complexes.36–38 It is noteworthy that, as previously observed,37 the Co–S bond of the bridging sulfur atoms (Co–S3) is not elongated. In fact, the second Co–S bond in the same dithiolene unit (Co–S4) exhibits the longest distance.
Spectroscopy data
The UV/Vis absorption spectrum of 2 in CH3CN (Fig. S1†) shows three absorption maxima at 831, 371, and 296 nm with ε = 8070, 47800 and 44800 M−1 cm−1, respectively. The negative-ion electrospray mass spectrum in acetonitrile solution exhibits two peaks at m/z = 606.98 ([CoIII(qpdt)2]−) and 1213.95 ([CoIII(qpdt)2]2−), corresponding to the monomer and dimer form, respectively (Fig. S2†). This result suggests that there is a monomer-dimer equilibrium in solution, as previously reported for other [Co(dithiolene)2]22− complexes.19,39
Electrochemistry
The electrochemical behaviour of 2 was investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) in acetonitrile in the presence of TBAP (0.1 M) as the supporting electrolyte. Three well-defined reversible redox events are observed (Fig. 3), in agreement with cyclic voltammograms previously reported for other cobalt dithiolene complexes.18,19,38
 Fig. 3  Cyclic voltammogram of 1 mM of complex 2 in CH3CN with 0.1 M tetra-butylammonium perchlorate (TBAP) as supporting electrolyte. Scan rate of 50 mV s−1; glassy carbon electrode of 3 mm diameter; first scan is shown. 
This behaviour is consistent with the presence in solution of a mixture of dimer and monomer (eqn (1)). The first redox wave (A in Fig. 3, eqn (2), E1/2 = 0.031 V) is reversible and tentatively assigned to the reduction of dimeric units by one electron to form [CoII(qpdt)CoIII(qpdt)]3− ((Ipc/Ipa = 1 and ΔEp = 0.064 V), as previously suggested.38 The second redox wave corresponds to the one-electron reversible reduction of the monomeric anionic species [CoIII(qpdt)2]− forming the dianion [CoII(qpdt)2]2− (B in Fig. 3, eqn (3), E1/2 = −0.514 V, Ipc/Ipa = 0.95 and ΔEp = 0.050 V). A third redox event occurs at −2.0 V, corresponding to a further reduction of the complex (Fig. S3†). Finally, the one-electron oxidation of the dimer to the [CoIII(qpdt)CoIV(qpdt)]− species is observed (C in Fig. 3, eqn (4), E1/2 = 0.508 V), also a reversible process (Ipc/Ipa = 1 and ΔEp = 0.061 V). The peak current (ip) showed a linear response as a function of the square root of the scan rate, denoting a diffusion-controlled process.40 [CoIII(qpdt)2]22− (2) ⇌ 2[CoIII(qpdt)2]−(1) (2) (3) (4)
Since complex 2 is soluble in other solvents, CVs were recorded also in DMF and CH2Cl2 with polarity indexes 6.4 and 3.1, respectively. Fig. S4A† shows the CV of 2 in DMF, where peak C is irreversible and mush less intense than B. Furthermore, the ratio between the intensity currents B/A in DMF is 6, twice higher than that observed in CH3CN (B/A ratio 2.5). In the non-polar CH2Cl2 solvent, the equilibrium is shifted towards the dimer (B/A ratio 2.5 in Fig. S4B†) and the peak C is reversible and similar in intensity to A. This is in good agreement with the monomer-dimer equilibrium being shifted towards the monomer in polar solvents and to the dimer in non-polar solvents. The thermodynamic equilibrium monomer-dimer is determined by different factors: the dielectric constant of the solvent and the concentration of the catalyst, among others.
Electrocatalytic proton reduction
Catalytic proton reduction was studied using a relatively weak acid such as acetic acid as the proton source (AcOH, pKa = 22.3 in CH3CN).41 Addition of increasing amounts of AcOH triggers the appearance of a catalytic wave, with an S-shaped curve and a plateau at −1.75 V (vs. Ag/AgCl). At this low potential and in the presence of acid we assume that most of the complex is in the monomeric form.15,18,19 The onset potential is at −1 V and the half-wave potential is at −1.45 V, thus indicating an overpotential of 650 mV (ref. 41) and a gain of 400 mV as compared to AcOH non-catalytic reduction42 (Fig. 4). Protonation of the ligand, containing basic N atoms (see calculations below), is likely to explain why the catalytic wave occurs at a potential of −1.45 V, 550 mV higher than the feature at −2.0 V, thus providing a mechanism for decreasing the overpotential of the system substantially. This is in excellent agreement with the potential gain provided by ligand protonation determined computationally (see below).
 Fig. 4  Cyclic voltammograms of 0.5 mM solutions of complex 2 in 0.1 M TBAP in acetonitrile under Ar conditions in the presence of acetic acid (AcOH): no acid (black), 0.5 mM (red), 1 mM (green), 2 mM (blue), 5 mM (purple), 10 mM (orange), 25 mM (brown), 50 mM (dark yellow) and 100 mM (dark blue) AcOH. In all cases the second scan is represented. Scan rate 50 mV s−1; 3 mm diameter glassy carbon electrode. 
The catalytic current is independent on the scan rate but only at scan rate values larger than 0.25 V s−1 (Fig. S5A†). In contrast, at smaller scan rates (0.01 to 0.25 V s−1) the ic value shows a linear response with respect to the square root of the scan rate (ν, in V s−1, Fig. S5B†). This provides confirmation that the catalyst behaves as a molecular catalyst via a diffusion-controlled electrochemical process. A rinse test is in agreement with the molecular nature of the catalyst (Fig. S6†). Fig. S6,† also shows the response of 100 mM AcOH in the absence of catalyst.
This allowed us to apply the ic/ip analysis with the purpose of estimating the hydrogen evolution kinetics by cyclic voltammetry. The presence of a small pre-wave has also been observed which shifts up to −0.88 V in 0.1 M AcOH. This is better seen in Fig. S7.† Under these circumstances the use of the more accurate foot-of-the-wave analysis (FOWA) developed by Savéant et al. was inappropriate.43 The ic/ip analysis, described more in detail elsewhere,20,21,44,45 allowed us to determine a TOF value of 5570 s−1 at −1.6 V vs. Ag/AgCl using a 0.1 M AcOH (Fig. S8 and S9†).
Since electrolysis experiments were conducted using mercury as the working electrode, we also carried out cyclic voltammetry using a mercury–gold amalgam as a working electrode. The same CVs were obtained using glassy carbon or mercury–gold amalgam electrodes, indicating that there was no modification of catalyst 2 by interaction with the mercury surface (Fig. S10†). Bulk electrolysis was conducted over a period of 6 h by applying a controlled potential (−1.6 V vs. Ag/AgCl), during which approximately 90 C has passed and H2 was produced as shown by gas chromatography. Using a concentration of 1 mM of 2 and an excess of AcOH (100 equivalents), the current yielded a high current of 5.5 mA on average during about 1 h (Fig. S11†). Then the current decreased slightly as a consequence of acid consumption. Indeed a second addition of 100 equivalents of AcOH after 3 h reaction restored the current intensity (5.3 mA) reflecting the stability of the catalyst. After a short lag phase of about 6 min H2 production occurred linearly as a function of time, even up to 6 hours reaction (Fig. 5). Within this lag phase, the charge passed through the system accounted for 3 electrons required for activating the catalyst (see calculations below) prior to H2 evolution. In the absence of the catalyst a steady background current was observed below 150 μA. The Faradic yield was 88 ± 5% and H2 production corresponded to 40 turnover numbers (TON) after 6 hours. Using a concentration of 0.1 mM of complex 2 allowed formation of H2 with much higher TON values. Long-time electrolysis produced 270 TON (6 h reaction) and 700 TON (22 h reaction) of H2 with a Faradic efficiency of 90%. The fact that the faradic yield remained constant with a small concentration of catalyst and that the current was re-established after each addition of acid shows that the catalyst is very stable under these conditions. This dependence of TON values on catalyst concentration has been observed previously.14,18

Few Co(dithiolene) complexes, with very different ligands, have been characterized as catalysts for electroreduction of protons17–19 but no TOF values have been reported. Furthermore, they have been assayed under much more acidic conditions. Under weak acid conditions, as reported here, one of the best systems, based on a mononuclear Ni complex with a phosphinopyridyl ligand provides a TOF of 8400 s−1.46 Thus our complex compares well with such an excellent catalyst.
Photocatalytic proton reduction
Proton reduction catalytic activity of complex 2 was evaluated by coupling it with [Ru(bpy)3]2+ as a photosensitizer (PS) upon irradiation with visible light (λ > 410 nm). Two standard systems were studied. The first one used triethanolamine (TEOA) in CH3CN as both a proton donor and the sacrificial electron donor. The second one used ascorbic acid (AA) as the sacrificial electron donor in a mixture of CH3CN:H2O (1:1). In both systems the reaction was carried out with a catalyst concentration of 20 μM and a PS concentration of 2 mM. Fig. 6 shows the time-dependent formation of H2 during irradiation of the reaction mixture in the case of TEOA in CH3CN. From these data, we extracted an initial turnover frequency (TOF) of 163 h−1 with respect to the catalyst (Fig. 6, inset). In the absence of either 2 or PS, no H2 was detected under the same conditions. However, after about 2 h of irradiation, hydrogen evolution stopped, indicating decomposition of at least one system component. After 2 h of reaction, it was found that addition of either a solution of 2 or a solution of [Ru(bpy)3]2+ was unable to restart H2 production. This result shows that both catalyst and PS were inactivated under these conditions. Using the ascorbic acid system (AA = 0.1 M) with the same concentrations of catalyst and PS, only 50 TONs of H2 were obtained after 2 hours. The fact that the addition of 50 μL of mercury did not affect the catalyst allowed us to exclude the involvement of Co nanoparticles during the catalytic reaction.
 Fig. 6  Hydrogen evolved with 20 μM [2] and 2 mM [Ru(bpy)3]2+ in 4:1 CH3CN:TEOA under a N2 atmosphere at 20 °C. Relative error is 10%. Inset: Initial H2 evolution. TON = turnover number. 
While it is quite meaningless to compare such different catalysts under such different irradiation conditions, photoreduction of protons catalysed by complex 2 is far less effective than by the Co-dithiolene complexes previously reported.17,18 The latter indeed provides initial TOF values between 690 and 3400 h−1 and activity lasted for 5 hours, showing greater stability.
Computational studies of the hydrogen evolution mechanism
DFT calculations were performed to investigate the mechanism of proton reduction catalyzed by the [Co(L)2]− complex (L = qpdt2−). In agreement with previous reports,15,18,19 we indeed assume that the monomeric form of the complex is the catalytically active one. In the absence of a crystal structure of the monomer, a [Co(L)2]− unit was cut out of the dimeric crystal structure and used as the starting point for further calculations. We point to the fact that the two qpdt2− ligands adopt a cis configuration relative to each other, in contrast to the recently reported MoO(qpdt)22− complex,21 in which they are found in a trans configuration. However our DFT studies showed no difference between the two configurations of the [Co(L)2]− complex for the proposed H2 mechanism.
Analysis of the spin densities and molecular orbitals provide insight into the electronic structure of the relevant species along the hydrogen evolution reaction pathway. The protonation and reduction reactions can be characterized through consideration of the coupled equilibria presented in Fig. 7 and 8, where vertical steps represent one-electron oxidation/reduction reactions, the free energy for which may equivalently be expressed as standard reduction potentials, horizontal steps represent acid–base equilibria, and diagonal steps represent proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) reactions.

Our calculations indicate that [Co(L)2]− has a square-planar structure and a triplet ground state with Mulliken spin density on cobalt of 1.58, showing that the cobalt is more reduced than typical CoIII and more oxidized than typical CoII, as also observed for [Co(bdt)2]− (bdt = benzene dithiolate), [Co(S2(3,5-tBu2C6H2)2)]− by Wieghardt47 and [Co(S2C2Ar2)2]2 by Hammes-Schiffer.15 The open-shell singlet state is only 1.4 kcal mol−1 higher in energy. The two unpaired electrons are localized on the dithiolene part of the ligand and have mainly S3pz and C2pz character (see Fig. S12†). Due to the non-innocent nature of the dithiolene ligands, the structure can be represented by the resonance forms [CoIII(L)2]− ↔ [CoII(L)(L′)]−, with L′ = qpdt˙−, a radical anion character being more pronounced as evident from the dominant contribution of the ligand fragment orbitals.
The energies for the 2e−/2H+ reduction/protonation steps are given in Fig. 7. The one-electron reduction of [CoIII(L)2]− to [CoII(L)2]2− occurs at a potential of E° = −0.85 V vs. Ag/AgCl electrode, in relatively good agreement with the experimental value of −0.51 V. [CoII(L)2]2− has a doublet ground state (S = 1/2), while the quartet state is 30 kcal mol−1 higher in energy. The unpaired electron resides on a dithiolene ligand orbital and leaves the Co center with a Mulliken spin density of 0.98, implying an oxidation state of ca. +2.
Protonation of either [CoIII(L)2]− or [CoII(L)2]2− is an exothermic process (−16.4 and −26.7 kcal mol−1, respectively) and in both systems the most favored protonation site is the N-atom in a trans orientation with respect to the oxygen of the ligand (see Fig. 7). In the reduced [CoII(L)2]2− complex, energies for protonation of the other N atom, cobalt or the two different sulfur centers (S adjacent to the protonated N sites and S in the exterior) are less favored by 8.5, 23, 15.6 and 21.3 kcal mol−1, respectively. The [CoII(L)(L-NH)]− intermediate could also be formed in a PCET process involving reduction and protonation simultaneously. Next, it can be further reduced (E° = −1.27 V) to [CoI(L)(L-NH)]2− followed by a protonation on the equivalent N atom of the second qpdt2− ligand (downhill by 27.7 kcal mol−1), resulting in the [CoI(L-NH)2]− complex. Alternatively, protonation can occur first (ΔG = −24 kcal mol−1) followed by a one-electron reduction (E° = −1.20 V) or a PCET process can proceed. These 2e−/2H+ reduction protonation pathways do not yield the formation of hydrogen, but rather to a [CoI(L-NH)2]− species, that needs to be further protonated and/or reduced (Fig. 8). With respect to the contribution of ligand protonation to reducing the overpotential, we obtain a positive shift of 520 mV (approximately 450 mV for the first electron transfer and 70 mV for the second one). This is in excellent agreement with the experimental data. Similar effect of protonation of the nitrogen atom causing a shift of the one-electron reduction potential to more positive values has been reported by J. P. Dicks et al. based on analysis of the frontier orbital energies in [(η5-C5H5)Co{SC(H)CRS}] compounds, with R = phenyl, pyridine-3-yl and pyrazin-2-yl.48
The Co center in [Co(L-NH)2]− is CoI and its one-electron reduction to [Co(L-NH)2]2− generates Co0 at a computed potential of −1.39 V. Relative free energies for protonation of [CoI(L-NH)2]− and [Co0(L-NH)2]2− were calculated for the cobalt center and the two different sulfur centers (S adjacent to the protonated N sites and S in the exterior). Co hydride formation proved more energetically favorable, with the protonation transfer step computed to be exothermic by 15.5 and 20.7 kcal mol−1 for [CoI(L-NH)2]− and [Co0(L-NH)2]2−, respectively. Protonation of [CoI(L-NH)2]− at sulfur atoms is by 9.4 and 14.3 kcal mol−1 less favored and that of [Co0(L-NH)2]2− is 8.8 and 20 kcal mol−1 higher in energy. These results are in agreement with the findings reported by Letko et al. for [Co(S2C2Ar2)2]2.19,49 However, for the analogous species [Co(bdt)2]2−, Hammes-Schiffer and co-workers computed that protonation should preferentially occur at the sulfur atoms.15 The CoIII hydride intermediate is a singlet, while the CoII hydride has a doublet ground state. As the calculated reduction potential for CoIII/CoII hydride is E° = −1.14 V, thus less negative than the potential before proton transfer (E° = −1.39 V), reduction of CoIII hydride should occur spontaneously.
Subsequent protonation of both CoIII and CoII hydrides results in the formation of a S–H bond syn to the Co–H bond. While the energy difference between the two types of S centers in CoIII hydride is 6.9 kcal mol−1 in favor of the site that is adjacent to the protonated N, in CoII hydride they are isoenergetic (ΔG = 0.4 kcal mol−1). However, our calculations indicate that proton transfer to the CoIII hydride is thermodynamically unfavorable (+ 3.3 kcal mol−1). In contrast, proton transfer to the CoII hydride is thermodynamically favorable by 5.7 kcal mol−1. The calculated reduction potential of the quadruply protonated CoIII hydride complex is −0.75 V. Both CoIII and CoII structures are well set to form hydrogen due to the close proximity of the H atoms. A transition state structure for transfer of the S–H proton to the metal center was located for the CoIII complex with a computed free energy of 6.9 kcal mol−1 (Fig. S13†). A Co–dihydrogen species precedes the release of hydrogen. A transition state with a slightly lower barrier of 5.8 kcal mol−1 was found for the CoII hydride complex, which then directly releases an H2 molecule and recovers the CoI(L-NH)2 intermediate (Fig. 9).

4. Conclusion
This study is a further illustration of the potential of cobalt dithiolene complexes as catalysts for proton reduction into hydrogen in organic solvents. Complex 2 indeed shows very good performances as a catalyst during electroreduction of a weak acid (acetic acid) in CH3CN in terms of overpotential requirement, stability and faradic yields. While it is also an efficient catalyst in a photochemical system it proved much less stable. Still very few of such complexes have been investigated for the H2 evolution reaction. [Co(bdt)2]− and [Co(mnt)2]− were the first complexes studied and were shown to exhibit high activity for the photocatalytic reduction of protons. They unfortunately rapidly decompose with time under irradiating conditions as well. These complexes have been less well characterized as catalysts for the electroreduction of protons, either provided as tosic acid or trifluoroacatic acid, in CH3CN or CH3CN/H2O solutions. Cobalt diaryldithiolene complexes have also been evaluated as catalysts for the electroreduction of anilinium tetrafluoroborate in DMF. Further studies will require more focused structure–activity studies in order to understand the structural and electronic parameters which control the reactivity of this class of catalysts and to optimize them.
What makes complex 2 unique amongst the short list of Co dithiolene complexes studied so far is the structure of the ligand. Previously, very simple dithiolene ligands, such as bdt, mnt or diaryldithiolene, have been used. Here, for the first time, an original mimic of molybdopterin is used as a ligand of the Co ion. This complex platform offers an opportunity to synthetically tune the reactivity of this class of catalysts and to better characterize the properties of molybdopterin-like ligands, so far very little studied.
Our DFT results highlight the strong electronic interplay between the metal center and dithiolene ligands for the generation of H2 by the [Co(qpdt)2]− catalyst. We show that N-protonation of the qpdt2− dithiolene ligand allows more anodic reduction potentials and lower overpotentials. Moreover, the S atom basicity plays a key role in the catalytic cycle, allowing hydrogen formation via an intermediate containing a Co–H hydride and an adjacent protonated S center from the dithiolene ligand serving as a proton relay.
