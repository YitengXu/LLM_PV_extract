    , Accepted 10th October 2019First published on 22nd October 2019AbstractThis review addresses the current potential of two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) nanomaterials for multi-functional polymeric nanocomposites. The properties of TMDs, characterization techniques, the applicability of different synthesis methods along with the surface treatment/modification of TMDs, are comprehensively examined by largely focusing on TMD/polymer nanocomposite preparation. Moreover, a vast range of nanocomposite properties, including mechanical/tribological properties, thermal stability/flame retardancy, and electrical/electronic properties, was investigated. The incorporation of TMDs in both thermoplastic and thermoset matrices can lead to the improvement of the aforementioned properties as reported by many studies in the literature. TMDs can thus possibly be considered not only as a liable reinforcement for polymers to induce multi-functionalities to nanocomposites but also a good hybridizing agent for other types of nano reinforcements. Potential opportunities offered by TMDs in composites/nanocomposites have opened up new horizons in a vast range of applications in different fields, including transportation, electrical/electronic, filtration and biomedical. This review has also compiled publications on the research and developments of TMDs and TMD composites/nanocomposites, from 1970 to the present, with the special focus on molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) and tungsten disulfide (WS2).
1. Introduction
The history behind the 2D layered structures goes back to the 4th millennium BC when the Mariţa culture used graphite, as a recognized representative of layered structures, in ceramic paints for decorating pottery. However, the lack of knowledge on synthesis at the time limited the use of layered structures to the bulk solids rather than 2D layer forms. In general, 2D nanomaterials refer to many-layered materials in which there are strong in-plane chemical bonds (such as covalent bonding) and weak coupling (van der Waals and/or electrostatic interactions) between the individual layers.1,2 Given the fundamental and practical aspects of nanotechnology, 2D nanomaterials can commonly be classified as 2D allotropes of different compounds/elements (containing two or more elements bonded covalently).3 More than eight decades ago, Landau and Peierls suggested that 2D crystals are thermodynamically unstable and, therefore, they could not exist.4–6 Since then, although scientists and researchers have been looking for the opportunities to produce individual freestanding atomic layers holding a large lateral dimension, the melting temperature of a thin layer rapidly drops with a loss in thickness, resulting in segregation into islands as well as decomposition.7–13 Based on this fact, by that time, 2D atomic monolayers were known merely as an integral part of larger three-dimensional (3D) structures. Therefore, without such 3D structures, 2D materials were supposed not to exist. Until the mid-1990s, most research was dealing with the intercalation of graphitic structures. For this purpose, a molecule/atom introduced between the layers of graphite did weaken the interlayer forces and increase layer spacing, which, in turn, facilitated the intercalation of molecules into the layered structures.14 During the 1960s, the best progress that could possibly be achieved was associated with the expanded graphite in which a few stacked layers, as many as 10 to 50, were obtained through rapid heat treatment.15,16 Eventually, in 2004, Andre Geim and Konstantin Novoselov discovered graphene, the one-atom-thick sp2 configuration of a 2D layer of carbon atoms, one of the allotropes of elemental carbon,5,6,14,17,18 which won them the Noble Prize in Physics in record time a few years later in 2010. Novoselov, Geim, and their co-workers initially revealed that separating graphene and evaluating its electronic transport were possible. Through the “scotch tape approach”, a simple mechanical exfoliation, they demonstrated that the isolation of a single layer of a layered structure was achievable.18–20 Remarkable properties ranging from high electron mobility, excellent thermal conductivity to intriguing mechanical properties were found for materials containing graphene, which provide opportunities in applications such as transparent conducting electrodes, single gas detection, piezoelectric, and energy storage devices.18,19,21–30
The unique opportunities of graphene and the development of its synthesis have opened up the Pandora's box of a new class of layered nanomaterials known as 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), beyond the gapless nature of graphene. TMDs show outstanding tunable optical and physical properties resulting from the quantum size effect and their nanosized thickness. The transport of photons, heat, and charge carriers can considerably be confined in the 2D plane, resulting in significant changes in the electronic and optical properties of the 2D nanomaterials.31,32
Recently, there has been significant interest in metal sulfide nanocrystals (TMDs) for energy-related applications due to their easily tunable electronic, optical, physical and chemical properties.33 Furthermore, such nanomaterials have the potential to find applications in energy harvesting systems arising from piezoelectricity.34 In comparison with graphene, which is a semimetal holding a zero bandgap,25 TMDs show a variable bandgap ranging from 0 eV to 2 eV for semimetal and semiconducting statuses, respectively. The bandgap of TMDs is dependent on the number of layers, the elemental combination, and the presence or lack of a doping atom.35 Such features of TMDs can be favorable for electronics-related applications. Among the different TMDs, the molybdenum (Mo) and tungsten (W) dichalcogenides (group VI TMDs) have received the most interest from scientists since they are mostly semiconducting materials.36–39 Semiconducting properties have been observed for such TMD nanolayers; in particular, optical absorption spectra have shown blue-shifts in comparison to the bulk form, indicating quantum confinement effects as the cluster dimension and size are reduced. It is assumed that the in-plane size reduction accounted for the observed confinement.40 It has been shown that the strain, arising from either mechanical loading or epitaxy on a substrate, can tune the electrical properties of monolayer TMDs (e.g., MoS2 monolayer). In this regard, as the strain increases, the optical bandgap becomes smaller.37 Additionally, due to the abundance of Mo and W-based TMDs, as well as their low cost, commercialization potential is quite high.12 TMDs in the forms of single layer and a few-layer can be synthesized and studied through a vast range of approaches including top-down and bottom-up methods. In some cases, the simplicity of production makes TMDs viable for commercialization.41–47 The application of TMDs has not only been limited to electrical and electronic fields, but it can also be seen in other areas such as polymeric composites and nanocomposites when both high performance and engineering behaviour become of importance. Similar to graphene composites/nanocomposites,48–50 the two terms “interface” and “scalable production” have to be considered when choosing proper synthesis and functionalization approaches.51
Although there are several reviews on TMDs, their synthesis methods, and functionalization approaches, there is a clear lack of comprehensive reviews that focus on TMD polymer composites/nanocomposites. In contrast to other reviews presented on TMDs and their synthesis methods,37,52–57 this review sheds light on different synthesis and modifications methods, their relevant characterization techniques with the view toward composite/nanocomposite preparation and multi-functionalities arising as a result of using those materials. This review narrows down the most applicable synthesis and functionalization methods, with particular attention to a vast range of properties, including mechanical, tribological, flame, thermal, and electrical properties, in recent years.
2. Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs)
2.1. Structure and properties
In a survey of literature published up to 2010, we found only 14 articles in the Web of Science under the titles including single keywords of ‘MoS2’ and ‘monolayer’. Nevertheless, the same search from 2010 onwards resulted in more than 1000 publications. This is not surprising as a Manchester University research team won the Nobel prize for graphene around this time in 2010, hence the increasing interest in 2D materials. The increasing interest in TMDs, stimulated by the presence of the direct gap in the MoS2 monolayer, and such enthusiasm promptly spread to other TMDs, specifically the semiconducting structures.58 TMD monolayers are considered as nanomaterials, which undoubtedly establish their positions in cutting-edge technology and science. Comparably, TMDs have layered structures similar to graphite and each monolayer has a thickness of around 0.6–0.7 nm with large lateral dimensions. Bulk layered TMDs having the formula of MX2 in which M and X denote a transition metal, typically from groups 4–10 of the periodic table, and chalcogens, respectively. They are X–M–X sandwiches stacked together with the covalent bonding of tri-layers and nanolayers along the crystallographic graphic c-axis, (0, 0, 1), which are bonded through weak van der Waals interactions (electrostatic dipole forces) (Fig. 1). So far, 40 different TMDs with various combinations of TMDs and chalcogen atoms have been fabricated. The possibility of exfoliation depends on the surface energies of TMDs. Herein, the definition of surface energy is the work needed to create new layers/surfaces from layered crystalline structures while peeling. The peeling process can create two new surfaces. As we know, the surface energy of graphene is around 65–120 mJ m−2. Similarly, the surface energies of molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) and tungsten disulfide (WS2) are around 65–75 mJ m−2; therefore, they are potentially cleavable.12,59–65 Bulk TMDs such as W and Mo dichalcogenides have various stacking polytypes and generally, 1T, 2H and 3R phases are the most common ones. The 2H and 3R phases have hexagonal symmetry with trigonal prismatic coordination and a rhombohedral symmetry with trigonal prismatic coordination, respectively. Additionally, the 1T phase shows a tetragonal symmetry with octahedral coordination.37,66 As a starting point, Mak et al.67 and Splendiani et al.68 studied the properties of TMD monolayers through optical measurements on a MoS2 monolayer. Natural bulk MoS2 is comprised of a combination of two forms including the hexagonal polymorph (2H-MoS2) and the rhombohedral polymorph (3R-MoS2); nevertheless, the 2H polytype is more stable and dominant for W and Mo dichalcogenides. Experimentally, lithium intercalation can result in the 1T phase. The 1H and 1T polymorphs of W and Mo dichalcogenides have similar thicknesses of ∼6–7 Å.12,37,69

(b) Structural polytypes: 2H (hexagonal symmetry), 3R (rhombohedral symmetry) and 1T (tetragonal symmetry). The lattice constant “a” ranges between 3.1 to 3.7 Å. The stacking index “c” denotes the number of layers in each stacking order with the interlayer spacing of ∼6.5 Å (reproduced from ref. 39 and 70 with permission from Springer Nature). 
According to the oxidation state and the coordination of the metal atoms in TMDs, these materials can present a full spectrum of physical properties, from insulators such as hafnium disulfide (HfS2), semiconductors like MoS2 and WS2, semimetals such as titanium diselenide (TiSe2) and tungsten ditelluride (WTe2), to true metals e.g. vanadium diselenide (VSe2) and NbSe2, capable of presenting superconductivity at low temperatures.12,65,71–75 Since 2014, scientists have discovered that several 2D materials can probably show a negative Poisson's ratio, known as auxetic structures, demonstrated in 1987 by Lakes.76 In general, ordinary materials show a positive Poisson's ratio. However, materials with a negative Poisson's ratio would experience a transverse contraction while they are compressed and they would undergo a transverse expansion as stretching in the longitudinal direction.77 Representative examples of such materials involve graphene in which vacancy defects are introduced. A pristine 2D material commonly shows high strength; nonetheless, topological defects and out-of-plane deformation can considerably induce changes in strength.22,78–83
As long as different lattice structures and bonding energies have been observed for 2D materials, it is expected that different configurations of intrinsic defects including dislocations, vacancies, line and topological defects (e.g., grain boundaries), as well as self-interstitials can be detected.71,72 With respect to MoS2, as an outstanding representative of TMDs, two types of mono-vacancies can be seen for including Mo and S vacancies (Fig. 2). Additionally, dislocation configuration and grain boundaries with pentagon–heptagon pair (5|7) dislocation atomic structures can also be observed.84

These layered TMDs show a combination of diverse properties such as outstanding mechanical, electrical, thermal and optical properties, which can be considered for the substitution of silicon in nanoelectromechanical systems, photonics, and electronics.66,85–87 The high stiffness of graphene can directly be associated with the hexagonal lattice as well as carbon–carbon bonds.88–90 However, it has been reported that MoS2 is more ductile as compared to graphene.79Table 1 shows a comparison of the mechanical properties of graphene and MoS2. Although graphene shows higher mechanical properties as compared with MoS2, a MoS2 monolayer has recently shown a surprisingly high Young's modulus and high breaking strength of around ∼300 GPa and ∼23 GPa, respectively, as compared to the values for chemically reduced graphene.91

With regards to toughness, a vast range of possible toughening mechanisms comprised of interactions between defects, atomic bridging effects, moving/propagating cracks, and out-of-plane deformation can be seen for TMDs, which can be the same as other 2D materials93 (Fig. 3). A tangible difference between the fracture in the MoS2 nanolayer and graphene nanolayer is dealing with the intensity of the buckling fracture. For example, although when it comes to mode II loading, both MoS2 nanolayers and graphene can experience out-of-plane deformation, graphene does not experience buckling cracks. This is due to the fact that graphene has greater strength, hindering the amplitude of buckling.94

Bulk semiconducting TMDs having a 2H form occur as indirect band-gap semiconducting materials, in which those gaps can range from 1.1 eV for MoSe2 to 1.2 eV for tungsten diselenide (WSe2) to 1.0–1.29 eV for MoS2, to 1.3–1.4 eV for WS2; whereas, when it comes to an individual monolayer, direct-band-gap semiconducting behavior can be seen. The direct band gaps for MoSe2, WSe2, MoS2, and WS2 monolayers are 1.5–1.6 eV, 1.6–1.7 eV, 1.8–1.9 eV, and 1.8–2.1 eV, respectively. Such observations can be associated with quantum confinement.47,67,96–98 With respect to the bulk and monolayers of WS2 and MoS2, the valence band maximum and the conduction band minimum are obtained from Mo 4d and S 3p orbital hybridization.99 Through phase engineering, there would be a platform allowing for the selective and local introduction of the metallic 1T phase on the 2H-MoS2 (semiconducting form), which can result in the fabrication of low-resistance ohmic contact.47,100
2.2. Synthesis approaches
On the grounds of the considerable achievement gained in the field of graphene, the technical aspects, novel ideas, and procedures learned for such materials have been applied and developed for other 2D layered materials such as TMD monolayers. Generally, two methods, including top-down and bottom-up approaches, have been used for the preparation of TMD nanolayers (Fig. 4).

(i) Chemical vapour deposition (reproduced from ref. 109 with permission from the American Chemical Society). 
The history behind the development of TMD synthesis goes back to 1985, a time that was sooner than expected, when the synthesis of the heterostructures of TMDs was accomplished; researchers were at the preliminary step of atomically thin van der Waals heterostructures.110 Since the 1960s, mechanical exfoliation has been employed to produce and investigate the properties of few-layer van der Waals materials including MoS2 and niobium diselenide (NbSe2).72,111–113 By using micromechanical exfoliation as the easiest and the fastest technique, individual crystal platelets from different layered TMDs can be isolated. For instance, rubbing a fresh MoS2 surface against another surface of its layered structure resulted in MoS2 monolayers, in which the monocrystalline remained under ambient conditions and no degradation was observed over a long period. Nonetheless, monolayers attained via this method are in a pronounced minority among thicker flakes, therefore, this can be considered as a limitation for large scale production.18 In order to overcome the separation process, the use of solution, colloidal solution, can facilitate the separation process according to size by means of centrifugation. With respect to the weak nature of van der Waals bonding (roughly ranging from 40 to 70 meV) and the surface tension (varying from 60 to 90 mJ m−2), which can be seen in common solvents utilized for graphite exfoliation, the bulk parent crystals can be exfoliated into nanolayers through these aforementioned approaches. N-Methyl pyrrolidone (NMP) has been considered as the most effective solvent. Although the use of NMP can result in good yields, its high boiling point makes its removal difficult and solvent residues can remain in the final product.114,115 Once exfoliation is achieved, the produced nanolayers possess high surface areas and aspect ratios. The aspect ratio is a crucial parameter for nanocomposites since the aspect ratio can efficiently affect crack blunting, cracking, crack deflection, and microcracking.116–118 It has been shown that the variation of aspect ratio can possibly be manipulated by the level of exfoliation and intercalation in polymer matrices.119 Generally, the higher degree of nanolayers exfoliation can result in a higher aspect ratio and a greater number of nanolayers in a polymer matrix.120 For colloidal solution preparation, generally, chemical modification/treatment and chemical intercalators are prerequisites so as to provide interlayer repulsive forces that can stabilize the dispersion and distribution. Intercalators can hinder the restacking of layers and such repulsive forces can be promoted by ultrasonication treatment. The power and duration of ultrasonication are very crucial since breakage and fracture can occur during the delamination of stacked layers.14,61,72 In 2011, Coleman et al.61,121 proposed direct liquid-based exfoliation. They showed that bulk TMDs such as WS2, MoS2, molybdenum diselenide (MoSe2), molybdenum ditelluride (MoTe2), tantalum diselenides (TaSe2), and NbSe2 can be well converted into nanolayers by using direct sonication-assisted exfoliation in common solvents. Among them, NMP, as mentioned above, and isopropyl alcohol have been the most favourable media for minimally decreasing the energy of exfoliation.65 These approaches are advantageous and are not usually accompanied by any chemical steps. Additionally, they are not air-sensitive and have satisfactory yields.122 Kalantar-Zadeh et al.115 used a grinding-assisted exfoliation approach in liquid medium, adopted from Yao et al.,123 to produce mono- and few-layer thick flakes from MoS2. They argued that the selection of grinding solvent in the grinding step plays a pivotal role in determining the lateral size and the thickness of the final products. In situ growth through the combination of aging, freeze-drying, sol–gel process, solvothermal reaction, and high-temperature carbonization is also another method by which monolayer film can be achieved by chemical reaction on the surface. In this method, the surface acts as a catalyst or just a template. The main advantage of this approach is that the neat single layers can be gained regardless of the isolation of accompanying thicker layers. However, in addition to the high temperature required for this technique, the challenge related to whether the achieved layers can exist independently of the surface is significant. Consequently, these challenges can make this technique less applicable when it comes to large scale production.124
To produce TMD nanolayers, which are homogeneous in terms of shape and composition, bottom-up chemical-based methods have become a cutting-edge approach.114 The solution-based synthesis of TMDs was developed by the following scheme. A reaction is initially heated to the desired temperature where the sources of growth decompose into monomers.125 As the monomers reach the supersaturation state, crystals start to grow spontaneously. By using the organic surfactants, the desired dimensions, e.g. shape and size, of TMDs are achieved. One of the outstanding advantages of the solution-based chemical synthesis of TMDs is the ease of control of shape, composition, and size by reaction conditions such as temperature, choice of sources of TMDs, concentration, and time.126,127 There have been some reports on TMD monolayers produced by vacuum-assisted vapour-deposition on metal substrates. The drawback of this method is that the areas of the produced layer are limited to several nm2, which are problematic for most applications.14 Such discussed issues lead to samples that have been made mainly via mechanical exfoliation and stacking.47,110,128–130 Various aforementioned synthesis methods (e.g., both bottom-up and top-down methods) have been already reviewed.12,14,72,131,132 Herein, we have compared these methods based on their advantages and disadvantages (Table 2).

The terms “functionalization”, “modification”, and “conjugation” have been utilized interchangeably. Although these terms convey, to some extent, various definitions in the different areas, they have been widely employed by different researchers to show the manipulation of TMD properties by forming covalent/non-covalent bonding of small molecules on the TMD monolayers.174–177 Similar to other types of organic 2D nanomaterials such as graphene, functionalization, and manipulation can be generalized to other 2D materials such as TMDs to improve their versatility in different applications such as polymer nanocomposites.51 The addition of functional groups to the TMD single layer can be utilized to change the chemical and physical behavior of the TMD single layer and consequently alter its reactivity toward different matrices.51 Over the past 20 years, the covalent functionalization of the edges or basal planes of low-dimensional carbon-based structures such as graphene has been an interesting subject of research.178,179 Such enthusiasm can be seen for other types of 2D materials such as TMD single layers. Different types of TMD treatments have been conducted and some of their outcomes are shown in Table 3. With respect to MoS2 nanolayers, as a predominant representative of TMDs, it is worth mentioning that in most cases the MoS2 nanolayers have been firstly exfoliated by Li intercalation followed by covalent functionalization. Li intercalation, an intra-layer atomic glide, is an effective approach that can lead to changes in the atomic arrangement and charge transfer from Li to MoS2. Such a phenomenon can result in the 1T metastable state in which the behavior is metallic, having high free carrier concentration.51,66,180,181 However, most of the modifiers used in non-covalent functionalizations, e.g., physical adsorption and conjugation, usually act as surfactants, facilitating nanolayer exfoliation particularly in sonication and high-shear force liquid exfoliation approaches. Moreover, the TMD doping can be done and controlled by noncovalent functionalization by using inorganic compounds such as chloride-containing molecules and redox-active molecules.182–185 Studying shifts in the photoluminescence behavior, e.g., the free carrier density changes the relative amounts of trion and exciton recombination in TMDs, can be useful for evaluating the doping level.186,187 Compared to noncovalent methods, the covalent treatment of TMDs is less prevalent. At high annealing temperatures, oxygen can produce nanoscale trenches in MoS2 showing strong PL emission intensity.188,189 Alloying is another method for the manipulation of TMD properties, where both chalcogens and the transition metals can be replaced, leading to ternary metal chalcogenides.190

Although functionalization has been successfully accomplished, there are still some limitations. A large quantity of organic solvents, harsh conditions, long processes, and scale-up are some of the drawbacks in these approaches. Additionally, as a result of functionalization, in some cases, some inevitable properties can be induced in TMDs, e.g., the change in the polytype of MoS2. In other words, in most studies, achieving MoS2 monolayers that are suitable for further functionalization is accompanied by the use of Li intercalating agents, which can induce the metallic phase in the system, and this needs further treatment to purify the produced nanolayers. Furthermore, the decrease in the aspect ratio during functionalization can be considered as another negative aspect of this approach. Nonetheless, a very recent study showed that the functionalization of MoS2 nanolayers can be done without changing the polytype.51
2.4. Characterization techniques
A vast range of novel approaches has been established to examine and study the physiochemical and structural properties of 2D materials including TMDs, and particular attention has been paid to the molecular structures and morphologies of TMDs due their size.12,218 In Table 4, we briefly review the common techniques that are used to characterize and analyze TMD structures.

2.5. Applications
Since 1936, different properties of TMDs have been studied (Fig. 6). These properties deal with thermal aspects, flame retardancy, tribology, electrical/electronic features, biocompatibility, mechanical properties, and optical properties. To better understand the distribution of published articles per application area, we used the Web of Science data to analyze the published reports in the literature (Fig. 6). As shown, most publications have focused on the optical aspects, electronic/electrical properties, as well as mechanical properties accounting for 38%, 23%, and 21%, respectively. Tribological investigation of TMDs is in fourth place, accounting for 16% of total publications. The thermal aspects, flame retardancy, and biocompatibility potential of TMDs have received the lowest interest and only 2% of publications in this field.

When it comes to applications of two-dimensional dichalcogenides, stability is a crucial concern that may limit their true potential for application. TMDs have different behaviors in different environments. Table 5 shows different types of TMDs, their stability, and some examples of their recently studied properties and applications.12,73 The stability of TMDs can be associated with the absence of dangling bonds on their surface, which makes them highly stable in both air and liquid.65

Based on recent studies on TMDs, they find their applications in different fields such as photovoltaic devices, light-emitting equipment, photodetectors, lasers and also optical applications. Over the recent decades, 2D nanomaterials like graphene have provided a platform for studying the fundamental aspects of light absorption/emission in 2D semiconductors, which can be extended to other 2D nanomaterials such as TMDs. It is crystal clear that the electronic band structures of TMDs play a pivotal role in defining their optical responses. With respect to direct-band-gap semiconductors, photons with energy greater than the bandgap can be directly absorbed or emitted, whereas indirect-band-gap semiconductors need an additional photon to provide the differences in momentum. Therefore, the absorption/emission procedure for photons is substantially less efficient in indirect-band-gap semiconductors, which is why the TMD monolayer has drawn substantial interest considering their optoelectronic properties.47 As a semiconductor, the MoS2 monolayer, shows considerable piezoresistive properties, indicating that its resistivity can be significantly manipulated with mechanical deformation since its bandgap is dependent on strain.80 Strain engineering, along with density functional theory (DFT) calculation can be utilized to observe the application of tensile or shear strain for tuning properties in TMDs. For example, a red-shift in the bandgap of semiconducting TMDs can possibly be attributed to biaxial tensile strain. Furthermore, considering the effect of stretching of TMDs, the transition from direct to indirect bandgap, and vice versa, can be predicted. Based on this fact, such a procedure can be advantageous for controlling optoelectronic properties.265,266 For instance, considering 411% of isotropic tensile strain, both 1H polytypes of MoS2 and WS2 show metallic behavior. However, when it comes to uniaxial strain, semiconducting behavior can be seen for them.265,267 Such a feature enables the MoS2 monolayer to be deployed for an ultrasensitive and conformable, transparent tactile sensor used for human-mimetic electronic skins.80,268,269 In addition to these applications, TMDs can be used in different fields such as electrochemical sensors, biosensors, low-power radio-frequency MoS2 transistors and circuits.80,270,271 Therefore, it can presently be claimed that the TMD family is one of the most promising materials in electrical devices, including superconductors, metallic structures, semi-metal materials, semiconductors, and insulators. Compared to the limitation of the bulk form, monolayers of MoS2 and WS2 can be used in the water-splitting process because of their band positions.12,39,272–274 MoS2 nanostructures have been extensively used in the hydrogen-evolution reaction. In this regard, both experimental studies and DFT calculations have shown that the edges of MoS2 and under coordinated Mo–S sites have high chemisorption potential for hydrogen evolution, analogous to platinum.275 Additionally, there have merely been a few studies employing TMDs in the field of biomedicine. For example, DNA sensors based on MoS2 have been prepared to detect DNA molecules holding specific sequences.276 In another study, MoS2 nanolayers have been fabricated for use in the simultaneous photothermal and chemotherapy of cancer. For this purpose, lipoic acid (LA) has provided a good platform for the strong attachment of polyethylene glycol.196
3. TMD polymer composites/nanocomposites
When it comes to engineering and designing a new class of multi-functional nanocomposites,277,278 the high specific surface area, the so-called “all-surface nature”, of TMD monolayer, along with the possibility of surface treatment, make TMDs an attractive choice for reinforcing polymer composites. While carbon fibres and carbon-based nanomaterials such as graphene and carbon nanofibres have been utilized commercially in lightweight composites,279–282 there has recently been much research on TMD monolayers and their relevant properties since the applicability of such nanomaterials in macrostructural fields, such as high-performance composites, can be of importance in modern everyday life.12,36,38,60,61,283–285
3.1. Process and fabrication
The first TMD composite fabrication can probably be dated back to the 1990s, when Yang et al.286 used water-soluble polymeric matrices such as poly(ethylene oxide), poly(ethylene glycol) and poly(vinylpyrrolidone) combined with TMDs including MoS2, MoSe2, and WS2. They showed that the used polymers could expand the interlayer of TMDs. Another fabrication achievement dates back to 1961 when Ford Motor Company produced grease known as “Spec M1C75B”, in which MoS2 and high-density polyethylene were used. This product has been utilized since that time in various parts, including steering linkages, ball joints, and wheel bearings.287 Similar to the techniques used for the fabrication of graphene/polymer nanocomposites, the same methods can be generalized to other types of inorganic/polymer nanocomposites, including inorganic 2D materials such as TMD single layer.23 Methods such as in situ polymerization,288,289 melt blending,290,291 and solution blending,292,293 can be used for TMD nanocomposites preparation. Generally, melt blending is the most cost-effective and industrially scalable approach in thermoplastic polymers. However, this method has some issues associated with the high melt viscosity of most polymers, which can introduce some difficulties in the composite impregnation, resin flow, removal of trapped bubbles, etc. Compared to melt mixing, a solution-based approach results in better particle dispersion; nonetheless, slow solvent evaporation often leads to particle restacking/re-agglomeration. In general, the scale-up of solution-based techniques is more challenging as there are some limitations such as the cost, toxicity and the large quantity of organic solvent required. On the other hand, in situ polymerization of monomers in the presence of nanomaterials is a fairly reliable method for the improvement of nanofiller dispersion into the matrix due to the close contact/interaction of nanoparticles with the polymeric matrix during polymerization.91,294,295 Additionally, TMD nanolayers should satisfy some preconditions when fabricating multi-functional polymer nanocomposites. In this regard, strong reinforcement–matrix interactions, uniform dispersion and distribution, as well as good compatibility/wettability between constituents, are of paramount significance since the ultimate properties of composites/nanocomposites are highly dependent on the interface and/or interphase.51,296 Based on this fact, the ability of TMDs, regarding the acceptance of the modification and treatment, depends on the TMD surface properties.285,297–304 Since the TMDs are categorized as inorganic materials, they possess low compatibility with most polymer matrices. Therefore, the role of surface functionalization in the improvement of the organophilic nature of TMDs is important.51 Once the reactive groups are attached to the TMD layers, achieving uniform dispersion as well as distribution with minimal damage and breakage of functionalized TMDs is the priority. Additionally, it is crystal clear that the final repulsive forces in the composites should be high enough to avoid restacking and re-agglomeration because they can have interference with crosslinking reactions for polymer matrices such as epoxy resins. A good distribution can result in a much larger interface, and consequently better stress transfer in the matrix.51,202 Therefore, selecting proper mixing conditions to provide a qualified amount of shear is very crucial. Furthermore, in some cases, reactive or non-reactive diluents can be used to facilitate the process of homogenization. However, in the case of non-reactive diluents, the evaporation of diluent from the final product is very important since it can have some devastating effects on the final properties. Based on the aforementioned discussions, the knowledge of the interface between TMD layers and matrices can considerably affect the composite fabrication process. As a strong interface between the TMDs and matrix is established, a vast range of reinforcing mechanisms can be seen during failure. Mostly, due to the high surface-to-volume ratio, the cracking energy can be dissipated by various mechanisms that have similarly been observed for graphene and clay nanocomposites.305–307 Ever since the researchers studied layered 2D nanomaterial reinforced nanocomposites, two main subjects have been the center of attention. Firstly, the question is whether the polymer can diffuse into the interlayer of 2D materials and secondly, the possibility of reaction between the penetrated polymer and 2D layers. For example, considering layered structures such as clay, mostly, the intercalating agent can not only expand the stacked layers physically but also further increase the distance between layers through intra-gallery reactions while polymerizing and/or curing (Fig. 7a). Omid et al.305 showed that the modification of nanoclay with chitosan could result in an increase in the basal d-spacing of the nanoclay because of the intra-gallery and extra-gallery reactions of epoxy with the modified nanoclay as well as the existence of modifier. Such results were also confirmed by XRD as well as TEM images (Fig. 7b), in which no peaks appeared in the XRD patterns of epoxy nanocomposites containing 2.5 wt% (EP-Q2.5) and 5 wt% (EP-Q5) of chitosan-modified nanoclay.

In this regard, one may hypothesize that introducing reactive groups into other structures such as graphite and TMD layers can also promote intercalation/exfoliation mechanisms as well as extra-gallery reactions that can remove viscose forces.308–310
3.2. Properties of TMD nanocomposites
Since 1970, the number of publications in TMD/polymer systems has increased considerably (Fig. 8a). In recent years, however, the most focused area in research publications has been on TMD composites with the aim to improve the mechanical performance, tribology behavior, flame, and thermal properties, as well as electrical and electronic performance (Fig. 8b). Based on this statistical analysis, in this study, we only focus on TMD polymer composites in which such properties have been investigated.
 Fig. 8  (a) The number of publications in TMD/polymer compounds since 1970. (b) Different properties that have been studied in TMD/polymer compounds in recent years (originated from the Web of Science). 
The addition of TMDs to polymeric matrices can affect different properties such as thermal and flame, mechanical and electrical properties. Regarding thermal properties, TMDs can have a physical barrier effect because of the strength and high aspect ratio, which can consequently limit the supply of volatile products and oxygen from a matrix. This can lead to better resistance toward the thermal degradation process. It is also worth mentioning that the good inherent thermal stability of TMDs such as WS2 can maintain the stiffness of the final product at high operating temperature, which can be very crucial for polymer matrices such as tetrafunctional epoxies.202,211 The lubricating behavior of TMD compounds makes them good candidates for applications where friction and wear properties are the key design parameters. TMDs nanolayers are mechanically strong in the in-plane direction, whereas the bonding and adhesion between the layers are weak; therefore, TMDs, e.g., MoS2, have been found to be strong in compression but show poor performance in shear forces. These characteristics could be very useful when it comes to the fabrication of low friction materials.311 MoS2 is considered to be one of the most known lubricant agents and its lubricity behavior can be largely affected by the oxidation process during service. The oxidation state of MoS2 can affect the final properties of the product since oxidation can lead to a lower corrosion resistivity, increment of friction, lowering and limiting the maximum service temperature for MoS2. Additionally, it can affect the shelf life as well.287,312 It seems that the increase in composite stiffness (elastic modulus) can decrease the erosion volume. It has been reported that211,313,314 when a high content of MoS2 (>10 vol%) is used, it could negatively affect the wear resistance of the polymer, whereas other rivals such as graphite and polytetrafluoroethylene could increase such properties. Such devastating effects could be associated with the poor mechanical properties of MoS2. Additionally, during the sliding procedure, segregation and extrusion of MoS2 from the polymer matrix could also occur.211

3.2.1. Mechanical and tribological properties. 
In regard to the glass transition temperature of nanocomposites, the interaction between TMDs and polymer matrix chains results in the reduction of the chain mobility and motion; therefore, the increase in the glass transition temperature is expected.246 With respect to mechanical properties, the addition of TMDs (≤1 wt%) such as MoS2 and WS2 has presented a satisfactory reinforcing potential for both thermosets and thermoplastics.51 Since the dispersion of TMDs in thermoset epoxy resins and the compatibility of the TMD-epoxy are the critical factors in the development of composites with strong interface and effective stress-transfer, standard approaches, such as the use of organic solvents, sonication, and modifiers, are often employed. In the following, a more detailed and quantitative discussion of some selected studies on both thermoset and thermoplastic TMD nanocomposites is presented. Although there are many published papers in this area, the mechanism and analysis behind the reinforcing effect of TMDs are almost similar. Fig. 9 demonstrates the various approaches to the preparation of TMD polymer composites, while their relevant fracture surfaces are presented in Fig. 10. As can be seen in Fig. 9-a1, liquid exfoliated MoS2 nanolayers can be used in the fabrication of epoxy nanocomposites. The addition of only 0.2 wt% of MoS2 nanolayers to the epoxy matrix led to 15%, 40%, and 60% increase in the glass transition temperature, tensile strength and fracture toughness of nanocomposite, respectively (Fig. 10-a2 and a3). In another study, the inclusion of 0.3 wt% MoS2 nanolayers improved the surface roughness of an epoxy nanocomposite by 150%. Nevertheless, studies revealed that a greater percentage of MoS2 nanolayers quite often results in a reduction in mechanical properties. This can be attributed to agglomeration, which in turn affects the interfacial interaction. Similar to graphene, crack deflection during crack propagation can be considered as the main mechanism for the improvement of fracture toughness. In other words, as the crack encounters MoS2 nanolayers, it can be tilted and twisted to result in higher energy absorption.246Fig. 9-b1 demonstrates the preparation of WS2/epoxy nanocomposite. In this study, the surface of WS2 was treated with an amine-rich polymer, i.e., polyethyleneimine, which could simultaneously improve the interaction between the matrix and nanomaterial, as well as reduce the agglomeration by the barrier effect arising from the branched structure and the high molecular weight of polyethyleneimine (Fig. 10a). Epoxy resin reinforced with 0.25 wt% modified WS2 resulted in 1.17%, 82%, 43%, and 65% increases in the glass transition temperature, fracture toughness, compressive and flexural strengths, respectively (Fig. 9-b2 and 10-b3). In addition to the improved mechanisms discussed for the MoS2/epoxy nanocomposites, MoS2 and WS2 also have barrier effects that restrict the segmental motion of the polymer chains. At higher contents, similar to MoS2, the agglomeration of WS2 and weak interfacial adhesion would be detrimental to the composite properties. Furthermore, these formed agglomerations can lead to interference in the epoxy cross-linking reactions.202 In another study, MoS2 was treated with cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) and the resultant nanolayers were incorporated into the epoxy matrix by means of the sonication assisted solution mixing method using tetrahydrofuran (Fig. 10b). The epoxy matrix reinforced with 0.2 wt% of treated MoS2 showed improvements by 23% and 27% in both tensile strength and Young's modulus (Fig. 9-c2). Additionally, an 83% increment in storage modulus was observed as well as improvement in the thermal stability as evidenced by the glass transition and decomposition temperatures data. The addition of treated MoS2 to the epoxy resin resulted in a rough surface with several dimples and crazing, representing the blocking/barrier effect of a large amount of MoS2, and the uniform distribution of the polymer matrix (Fig. 10b).315 On the other hand, TMDs can also reinforce common thermoplastics such as polyethylene oxide, polyethylene, polypropylene and the like. Similar to thermosetting matrices, solution blending is used for the preparation of TMD thermoplastic polymer composites. Different concentrations of MoS2 dispersed in solution were added to polyethylene oxide solution to prepare nanocomposites films (Fig. 9-d1). The addition of only 0.9 wt% MoS2 resulted in 53%, 88%, and 73% improvements in yield stress, Young's modulus, and elongation at break, respectively (Fig. 9-d2). The significant improvement in the Young's modulus showed that the presence of enhanced effective volumes of MoS2 nanolayers resulted from the crystalline coating on the MoS2 surface or the interfacial volume occupied by the modified groups. Because of the nanocrystal stiffness and the nanoconfined interfacial zones, the differences between the stiff nanolayers and soft polymers could be simply faded away and led to the creation of the efficient stress-transferring area in nanocomposites. As the content of MoS2 increased to 0.9 wt%, the specific spherulite structure and their boundaries became blurred and therefore, in this case, the tough fractured surface was observed, indicating the effective stress transfer and mild stress-whitening phenomenon in the polymeric composite (Fig. 10c).316 The solution mixing method was also employed for polyethylene nanocomposites since ultrasonic dispersion could provide a homogeneous dispersion (Fig. 9-e1). As seen in Fig. 9-e2, the addition of a small amount of well-exfoliated MoS2 (0.7 wt%) resulted in the enhancement of the tensile modulus, yield stress and breaking strength by values of 38%, 17%, and 10%, respectively. Additionally, a 17% increment in the elongation-at-break was also observed. The addition of MoS2 to polyethylene induced roughness in the morphology of the fractured surfaces in composites. As illustrated in Fig. 10d, the pull-out morphology could be considered as evidence of strong interfacial adhesion leading to higher composite performance. Similar to improving mechanisms in epoxy/MoS2 composites, the high aspect ratio, good exfoliation, defect-free structure, and strong interactions played pivotal roles in boosting the properties, including thermal and mechanical properties.317 The reinforcing mechanical mechanisms of the MoS2 nanolayers are highly similar to the nanocomposites reinforced with graphene, either the neat graphene or functionalized one. For instance, Zabihi et al.300 reported that the addition of interfacial booster nanomaterials such as amino-functionalized graphene (f-GNP) can result in better performance regarding stress-whitening, which can be sensed in crack propagation retardation (Fig. 10e and f). In situ polymerization is another method used for the preparation of TMD composites based on polyolefins. In situ polymerization of polypropylene in the presence of Ziegler–Natta catalyst intercalated MoS2 was conducted to prepare MoS2/polypropylene composites (Fig. 9-f1). The addition of 0.52 wt% of exfoliated MoS2 can result in 11% and 61% improvements in tensile strength and modulus, respectively (Fig. 9-f2). Likewise, the in situ polymerization of polyethylene was also in situ polymerized using exfoliated-MoS2/MgCl2-supported Ti-based Ziegler–Natta catalyst. The outcomes of the (1.23 wt%) MoS2/polyethylene composite were +57%, +114%, and −19% changes in tensile strength, modulus, and elongation at break, respectively.318,319 As discussed earlier, it is worth mentioning that the functionalization of MoS2 can considerably affect the final properties. For instance, it has been shown that the functionalization of MoS2 nanolayers with 4,4′-diamino diphenyl sulfone can make them promising reinforcements for various ranges of polymers including unsaturated polyester, polyvinyl alcohol and thermoplastic polyurethane. The addition of only 0.5 wt% of 4,4′-diaminodiphenyl sulfone functionalized MoS2 resulted in improvements in the tensile strengths of unsaturated polyester, polyvinyl alcohol and thermoplastic polyurethane by +30%, +15%, and +11%, respectively, whereas they were only +12%, +5%, −3% without modification.51 Such observations could result from the effectiveness of functionalization during the hydrothermal-assisted ball milling approach.

With respect to tribology, MoS2 has been incorporated into composites as an important lubricating solid from the TMD family to enhance the tribological performance. The MoS2 layers can easily slide over each other and as long as the basal plane of such materials is parallel to the matrix surface, an improvement in the tribological properties is expected. The low friction coefficient and higher hardness can also improve the resistance of the polymeric matrix to being worn off by enhancing the load-carrying capacity. Additionally, good thermal stability under high temperatures can be effective in modifying the tribological properties. In other words, composites become more vulnerable to deterioration because of the presence of frictional heat; therefore, the lubricating solids should have good thermal stability and chemical inertness. Generally, mechanisms including rolling, exfoliation, shearing, and deformation can be considered for tribological phenomena. Regarding the lubricating behavior, it is also worth mentioning that the MoS2 nanolayers are much more effective as compared to the MoS2 microparticles, which could be due to the lower coefficient of friction of MoS2 as compared to microparticles.320–324 Recently, there has been much interest in the hybrid reinforcements of matrices using MoS2 and other filler/reinforcing materials such as TiO2,325 reduced graphene oxide (rGO),326 Fe3O4 nanoparticles,327 and carbon spheres.328 Such hybrids demonstrate much more improved lubricating behaviour as compared to MoS2 only. For example, micron-sized carbon fibres (CF) have good mechanical properties, such as good wear resistance, and since it can be easily dispersed homogeneously in the polymer matrix, it is a good candidate for hybridization with MoS2 in a polyimide matrix (PI).324 The addition of either CF or MoS2 can lead to an improvement in wear resistance in PI (Fig. 11-a1). However, an increase and a reduction in the coefficient of friction were observed with the addition of CF and MoS2, respectively. Compared to CF, MoS2 has a greater lubricating effect. Furthermore, the simultaneous use of both fillers showed a synergistic effect in terms of modifying the tribological properties. The worn surface morphologies of PI/CF and PI/CF-MoS2 are observed in Fig. 11-a2 and a3. Since CF maintained creep resistance and high compressive strength, it could remove the plowing effects of asperities in the counterparts on PI. It was expected that only bulgy CF would be observed without any noticeable signs of plowing (Fig. 11-a2). In this case, the coefficient of friction in PI/CF was higher than that of PI because of the reduction of the shear effect. On the other hand, with the addition of MoS2, the bulgy CF and debris were hardly seen, which resulted in a very smooth surface (Fig. 11-a3). It is believed that the MoS2 coating can prevent CF from being broken and, consequently, less bulgy CF were seen.324 Although other polymers possessing good strength and stiffness, such as polyamides (PA), have good wear resistance and self-lubricating behaviour, such properties can be boosted further by the addition of lubricants. In one study, PA composites with glass fibre (GF) and MoS2 were prepared.329 It was observed that the coefficient of friction was somewhat as same as the shear stress parallel to the MoS2 layers, separated by the yield stress or hardness perpendicular to the MoS2 layers. The addition of additives such as GF and MoS2 can result in a reduction of the water absorption and, consequently, the mechanical and thermal properties of PA were less affected by water adsorption. The specific wear rate of nylon 66 decreased after the addition of MoS2 and GF (Fig. 11-b1). This phenomenon can be seen for all sliding distances and was confirmed by SEM images. Compared to PA/GF (Fig. 11-b2), the addition of MoS2 would result in less wear track and damage to the morphology (Fig. 11-b3).329 One of the polymers that has the lowest wear rates is poly-ether-ether-ketone (PEEK), making it a good candidate for various applications where high wear performance is required. Nonetheless, the coefficient of friction in PEEK is still relatively high.330 It is hypothesized that by the addition of MoS2, a transfer film can improve the tribological properties of the matrix. This transfer film should be thin, uniform, and well-bonded to the surface. Similar to the previous discussion, PEEK containing 5 wt% MoS2 (M5 sample) had approximately 20% less wear rate as compared with the pure PEEK. However, PEEK containing 2% and 10% wt% MoS2 (M2 and M10 samples), showed an increase in the wear rate of the order of 25% and 2.5 times, respectively (Fig. 11-c1). The significant increase in wear rate can be associated with the composite hardness and the transfer-film surface coverage. This observation was confirmed by SEM images, as shown in Fig. 11-c2 (neat PEEK) and Fig. 11-c3 (M5 sample). As can be seen for neat PEEK, the removed materials with shapes similar to scratches indicated that plastic deformation occurred inside these areas and this is much more tangible as compared to the outside of the scratches. However, for the M5 sample (Fig. 11-c3), only micro-abrasion was detected and there was no specific plastic deformation.330 The tribological features of other types of matrices, such as epoxy resin (EP), can be modified by suitable additives such as carbon-based materials including carbon nanotubes, carbon nanofibre, graphene, and carbon fibre or other types of non-carbon lubricating materials such as polytetrafluoroethylene and TMDs. With respect to the first group, the improvement of wear resistance can be provided through enhancing the compressive strength and hardness. On the other hand, reducing the coefficient of friction and shear stress can be achieved by the addition of the second group. In a study, a facile approach was used to produce hierarchical CF–MoS2 hybrid material via a hydrothermal process.331 The result was that MoS2 attached to the CF with a thickness of 5–8 nm. The incorporation of either CF or MoS2 can enhance the friction and wear properties of EP (Fig. 11-d1). In the case of EP/CF, the decrease in the wear and coefficient of friction is associated with the reinforcement effect of CF. However, for MoS2, a good self-lubricating aspect is predominant (EP/MoS2). Based on this fact, the hybrid of CF and MoS2 can display improved tribological properties. As can be seen in Fig. 11-d2, CFs were observed on the worn surface and the signs of large EP areas and debris were significantly improved because of the reinforcing effect of CF. On the other hand, the worn surface of the EP/CF-MoS2 composite was very flat (Fig. 11-d3); in other words, grooves and traces were hardly seen. It was concluded that high loading can result in considerable frictional heat and soften polymer composites. As a result, high coefficient of friction and wear rate were expected. Additionally, when it comes to heavy loads, the failure of MoS2-modified CF is highly possible. Under this condition, one can expect abrasion arising from CF-MoS2; however, at different sliding speeds, the trend is different. Under a high sliding speed, the coefficient of friction is lower and the wear rate is higher as compared to lower sliding speeds. This can be explained by the fact that there is a short time to create more adhesive points; however, temperature will increase at high sliding speed, which can have an adverse effect.331 As mentioned above, MoS2 is a good solid lubricant for improving the tribology of different matrices; nonetheless, its oxidation can be considered as a demerit. Similar to epoxy resin, the addition of different MoS2 content to the phenolic resin can decrease the specific wear rate as compared to neat phenolic resin (FM).332 At higher MoS2 content, a low specific wear rate is seen (Fig. 11-e1). The anti-wear potential of the MoS2 composite depends on two factors including the friction-reducing ability and the enhancement of mechanical properties of MoS2 composite arising from the addition of MoS2. The surface of neat phenolic resin contained damaged and rough areas including particles and debris on the worn surface (Fig. 11-e2). This observation indicated that fatigue and abrasion were the main mechanisms. However, the phenolic resin containing 7.5 vol% MoS2 showed a smoother surface (Fig. 11-e3). It is worth mentioning that the formation of secondary
plateaus with shiny areas can increase the contact area and consequently decrease the contact pressure, which is in good agreement with the lowest amount of specific wear rate of the composite containing 7.5% MoS2.332,333 Sometimes, the inclusion of solid particles in polymeric matrices can result in the reduction of mechanical properties, which can be due to the poor dispersion and interlayer delamination. Consequently, it can probably have an adverse effect on wear resistance. Based on this fact, alongside solid lubricants, other components are used to compensate for the lost mechanical properties. For example, N-methylation modified polyamide 6 is added to phenol formaldehyde to improve mechanical properties, whereas MoS2 is used to modify the tribology of such composites. Compared to the composition including 98 wt% phenol formaldehyde resin and 2 wt% N-methylation-modified polyamide 6 (A4), the addition of different contents of MoS2 can lead to an increase in the wear resistance (Fig. 11-f1). This phenomenon can be explained by the fact that MoS2 can form a lubricating film under shear forces. Compared to the A4, the addition of 3 wt% of MoS2 to A4 (Fig. 11-f3) resulted in a smooth morphology, including small amounts of debris and particles that are evident on the surface. This observation indicates that abrasive and fatigue mechanisms are the dominant wear mechanisms.334 Similar to MoS2, WS2 shows good potential for the modification of the tribological properties of polymers. Due to its comparable properties, WS2 is a more expensive substitute than MoS2 but it has a 100 °C higher oxidation resistance. The addition of WS2 to epoxy,335 PEEK,336 PTFE,337 poly(vinyl butyral)338 polypropylene/ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer blends,339 and the like has led to an improvement of the tribological behaviour, including the wear rate as well as the coefficient of friction, with similar mechanism to that discussed for MoS2.

3.2.2. Thermal stability and flame retardancy. 
TMDs such as MoS2 have been found to act as efficient halogen-free flame retardants that are capable of reducing flame and fire hazards in polymeric matrices including epoxy resins. Improvement in char formation, thermal stability, and flame retardancy can be achieved by the addition of MoS2, which is capable of inducing a physical barrier effect of layers in epoxy resins. The addition of MoS2 to polymers can improve the char residue formation by acting as a protective shield/barrier for mass and heat transfer as well as free the radical trapping effect of the carbon nanotube networks, and consequently slowing down the heat release rate and smoke production during combustion.340,341 In the following section, some examples of TMD flame retardant applications in some high-performance composites are presented. The modification of MoS2 with chitosan (CS) can result in better dispersion and consequently, a more effective barrier effect.342 As can be seen in Fig. 12-a1 for the pure epoxy resin after the flammability test, the addition of 2 wt% chitosan-modified MoS2 to the epoxy can lead to a char morphology with no visible voids (Fig. 12-a2). As the flame extends the burning surface of the polymer, it has a tendency to propagate and penetrate inside the bulk of the material. At the same time, external heat combined with oxygen can go into the material layer beneath to start internal pyrolysis. In the chitosan-modified MoS2-reinforced composite, each nanolayer can act as a separate nano-barrier, preventing the permeation of external heat, oxygen, and volatile substances. The nano-barrier effect, which can be optimized by good dispersion, can lead to a tortuous path to reduce the release rate of flammable gases including hydrocarbons, consequently reducing the heat-release rate. The modified nanolayers can also stimulate the accumulation of hydrocarbons and aromatic compounds, leading to the formation of char residue and the reduction of total heat release. It is worth mentioning that such a mechanism is highly dependent on the effective quantities of MoS2, which can be guaranteed by good dispersion.342 Similarly, in another study, octa-vinyl polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxanes (OvlPOSS) were used to functionalize MoS2 for reinforcing polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) composites.343 The residual char in neat PVA showed an uneven and looser char layer with a mass of voids spread out on the porous and incompact surface (Fig. 12-b1). On the other hand, on the addition of 2 wt% of OvlPOSS-MoS2 into the PVA polymer, fewer voids became observable since the surface was much more compact (Fig. 12-b2).343 According to the work done by Cai et al.,344 MoS2 showed greater thermal stability than other conventional layered structures, and can act as a smoke suppressor, which, in turn, led to the creation of abundant and various reactive sites on its surface, comprised of vacancy, sulfur defect, and edge sites. These properties make it a better potential candidate in the production of well-dispersed flame retardants for polymeric systems. In another study, thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) was modified with polyethyleneimine (PEI)-treated MoS2.345 Thin and fragile layers of char including abundant cavities and voids can be seen for TPU (Fig. 12-c1), indicating that the char residue of TPU is not enough to prevent the combustion of the underlying layer of material. However, the addition of PEI-modified MoS2 resulted in the formation of a continuously compacted structural char (Fig. 12-c2).345 The same mechanisms have been discussed for other polymer nanocomposites; for example, the addition of MoS2 nanoflowers, treated with poly(cyclotriphosphazene-co-4,4′-sulfonyldiphenol) (PZS), to epoxy resin improved the char residue formation (Fig. 12-d2) as compared to the neat epoxy (Fig. 12-d1).344 It has been shown that PZS has been presenting self-extinction in flame tests and high limiting oxygen index (LOI) values. Generally, the hybridization of nanomaterials has been demonstrated to produce higher fire retardancy performances, as compared to each individual component. Moreover, it was estimated that better dispersion can be achieved when it comes to hybrid nanofillers. For example, the deposition of layered double hydroxide (LDH) on the exfoliated MoS2 surface can probably alleviate the nanolayer agglomerations in the polymer matrix. LDH, as a flame retardant, consists of positively charged metal hydroxide layers.346 It possesses outstanding smoke suppression properties and flame retardancy because of its layered structural form and chemical composition. As can be seen in Fig. 12-e1, the pure epoxy resin shows a discontinuous formation of a char layer with noticeable cracks and voids, whereas in the epoxy resin containing LDH/MoS2, the cracks and voids decreased considerably (Fig. 12-e2).346 Similarly, epoxy resin reinforced with other types of 2D nanomaterials such as nanoclays have shown almost the same trend in improvement of fire retardancy. Omid et al.309 showed that modification with deoxyribonucleic acid can lead to the formation of dense and fully compact char without any tangible cracks on its top surface (Fig. 12-f2). Such a phenomenon can considerably reduce heat and volatiles release, as compared to the neat epoxy that consists of wide cracks (Fig. 12-f1).

3.2.3. Electrical and electronic properties. 
It has been shown that inserting modifiers such as MoS2 into the TMDs can change their properties and provide them with interesting applications. In this regard, conjugated polymers have been used as inserted modifier polymers in the interlayer gallery of MoS2 to form nanocomposites. Such a selection of polymers is because of their anisotropic optical and electrical properties, electrochemical and electrochromic behaviors. MoS2 in a bulk form has a 2H structure related to a trigonal prismatic coordination, whereas the monolayer form, 1T structure, has an octahedral coordination, which can be attributed to the intercalator. As discussed earlier, this phase does not exist naturally and it can be obtained by exfoliation of the 2H-MoS2 bulk form. For example, the insertion of polythiophene into MoS2 can result in nanocomposites with improved electrical conductivity. Compared to pristine 2H-MoS2, a semiconductor form holding electrical conductivity around 3.3 × 10−3 S cm−1, the polythiophene/MoS2 nanocomposites have shown electrical conductivity of around 5.3 × 10−2 S cm−1.347 Polythiophene is a conductive polymer possessing conjugated π-bonds. Once it is p-doped, the addition of polythiophene between the host layers can lead to an increase in the electrical conductivity. With respect to polythiophene/MoS2 nanocomposites, the polymer chain direction is parallel to the MoS2 layers and this is beneficial for electron transportation between the organic and inorganic phases, because of the coupling between the guest-conjugated p-orbitals and the semiconducting host layers. During the nanocomposite preparation, the formation of a small amount of residual 1T-MoS2, e.g., metallic form can have an effect on the enhanced conductivity of the nanocomposite. Such nanocomposites show semi-metallic conductivity behavior and thermal response, which are steady with negatively charged single-molecule layers.347–352 Excellent conductive polymers such as poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene) (PEDOT) have been proven to show significantly improved stability as compared to other conductive polymers. Undeniably, it appears to be one of the most stable conductive polymers currently available.353 The combination of PEDOT with MoS2 results in composites that are almost one order more conductive than pristine MoS2. The electron transport behavior of MoS2 has been considerably improved by using the intercalative PEDOT guest as long as the carrier density can experience a tangible change. Also, it was expected that PEDOT/MoS2 would show a linear surge in conductivity, indicating the thermal activation behavior of electron transport.354 Similarly, other polymers as shown in Fig. 13 can be used for this purpose.
 Fig. 13  The electrical conductivities of different polymer nanocomposites. 
Considering different properties that have been discussed beforehand, there have been several works focusing on the effects of the addition of TMDs on various properties in polymeric composites. A comprehensive review of such studies has been conducted and is presented in Table 6.

Overall, as can be seen, the incorporation of conjugated polymers into layered TMDs has been an interesting subject of research as long as the resulting organic/inorganic compound can show a vast range of properties including considerable electrical, structural, thermal and mechanical properties.366 A literature analysis revealed that there were more published studies on MoS2 as compared to WS2. The reasons for this could be due to the fact that MoS2 is lighter than tungsten disulfide and its noticeable bandgap with exotic properties in such materials is considerable.246,367

3.3. Hybrid TMD composites
Recently, the fabrication of polymer nanocomposites based on nanohybrids including two or more types of nano reinforcements has received a great deal of attention. It is believed that nanohybrids can have a synergetic effect on the improvement of different features such as mechanical, thermal, and electrical properties of nanocomposites.340 Hybridization can control the physicochemical features of each constituent and produce various functionalities between each of the components through synergistic effects. It is worth mentioning that such a specific hybrid structure can make the best use of the properties of each component. For example, the improvement of the dispersion for each phase, which can also result in the enhancement of mechanical properties.367Table 7 presents a summary of hybrid fillers with TMDs and their composite properties.

There are many publications that demonstrate that the hybridization of MoS2 with different materials, including graphene375 polyphosphazene nanoparticle376 and trisilanol-phenyl-POSS,377 has led to the improvement of the mechanical and flame behavior of composites.
The addition of hybrid nano reinforcements, e.g., TMDs including MoS2 alongside other nanomaterials such as boron nitride, to composites can induce fractural behavior similar to the situation where there is only one type of reinforcement. For example, in a study conducted by Ribeiro et al.,368 the incorporation of MoS2 in a matrix changed the smooth surface of the epoxy matrix into a rough surface (Fig. 14). Such an observation indicates that the existence of the nanofiller in either single or hybrid form can modify the crack propagation behavior of the epoxy matrix (Fig. 14b–d), which is otherwise fragile and possesses poor crack behavior (Fig. 14a). Particularly, the hybrid filler, MoS2/hexagonal boron nitride, can act as an anchor for polymer chains, manipulating and changing the failure pattern (red arrows in Fig. 14d) and consequently decreasing the possibility of crack formations. This suggests that there is a strong interaction between polymer and nanofillers, which in turn can lead to composites with improved mechanical properties. Therefore, it can be hypothesized that hybridization can not only improve structural performance such as mechanical properties but can also introduce new functionality into the polymer matrices. In such cases, the matrices can benefit from both nanofillers simultaneously while enhancing other structure-related properties.

3.4. Comparison of TMDs and other nanomaterials
In order to make a meaningful comparison of the properties of composites filled with TMDs with those reinforced with other conventional 2D nanomaterials, graphene, nanoclay, and MoS2 were considered as three vastly studied representatives of organic 2D nanomaterials, inorganic 2D nanomaterials, and TMDs, respectively. Although graphene and clay can improve different behaviours, such as thermal and mechanical performances, the addition of such nanomaterials is accompanied by some drawbacks.297,300 Compared to graphene, achieving similar improvements in mechanical properties can be attained by a considerably larger amount of clay. For example, different studies have shown that around 63%, 80%, and 89% increases in the fracture toughness of epoxy were achieved for the addition of 3.5 wt%, 2.5 wt%, and 1 wt% of nanoclay filler, respectively.378–380 The same trend can be seen for other nanomaterials. For example, roughly 10 wt%, 14.8 wt%, and 5 wt% titanium dioxide, silicon dioxide, and aluminium oxide, respectively, were needed to achieve 62–65% improvement in the fracture toughness of an epoxy nanocomposite, whereas the addition of only 0.2 wt% of MoS2 to the epoxy resin led to an enhancement of around 60% in fracture toughness. Furthermore, such an amount of nanoclay could lead to a reduction in tensile strength, whereas an improvement of around 40% in tensile strength was achieved.246,381,382 Graphene, in very low content, has great potential for improving the properties of polymer matrices, however, when it comes to its electrical insulation and dielectric properties in polymers, the gapless feature of graphene can be its main drawback, as compared to the adjustable electrical properties of TMDs.246,289,383 Yuan et al.384 showed that polyimide nanocomposite films containing a small amount of MoS2 have outstandingly higher thermostability and overall performances as compared to the those reinforced with fluorinated graphene,385 graphene oxide,386 chemically reduced graphene oxide,387 and covalent or non-covalent functionalized graphene.388 Considering other properties such as flame retardancy, carbon nanotubes are good examples of such materials for most thermoplastics such as ethylene-vinyl acetate, polystyrene, poly(methyl methacrylate), nylon 6, low-density polyethylene and polypropylene. Nonetheless, obtaining good dispersion and strong interfacial interaction levels is still challenging. Carbon nanotubes are not easily uniformly dispersed in polymeric matrices such as epoxies, similarly, TMDs including MoS2 need to be homogeneously dispersed and distributed in the matrix.340,389–395
3.5. Applications
Based on this fact, with the advent of the knowledge of TMDs and their properties, the TMD composites find their applications in different fields. They can be used in applications ranging from aerospace, electrical fields to lubrication applications including transportation systems such as automotive and railroad curve-rail grease.202,211,287,396 As shown in Fig. 15a, from 1990 to present, 87% of publications have been focused on TMD/thermoplastic systems, whereas only 10% of studies have been dedicated to the thermoset-based TMD compounds. Elastomers, on the other hand, only account for 3% of the total matrices used for the development of TMD polymer composites. Fig. 15b shows applications of TMD polymer composites in various fields.

Epoxy composites reinforced with TMDs such (e.g. MoS2 or WS2) can be used in aerospace and the military due to their good mechanical, thermal, and tribological properties. Additionally, the toughening mechanism is another predominant factor that makes the TMD/epoxy composite suitable for such applications.202,246 Due to the improved mechanical properties, abrasion behavior, and tear strength, as well as the reduction of rolling resistance and heat-build up, polymer composites based on MoS2 (e.g. styrene-butadiene rubber/Carbon black/MoS2) have the potential to be used in tires for the automotive industry.372 Another application of polymer TMD composites is in lubricants for the transportation sector. Composites such as nylon 66/MoS2/short glass fibres329 can be used as lubricants, with the aim of having low friction coefficient and lubricating properties.287 Additionally, the composites of polystyrene/modified MoS2 (ref. 211) can be used in self-lubricating composites. Mostly, such self-lubricating composites can be used as films for metallic surfaces. As solid lubricants, compared to graphite, which is used in terrestrial applications, MoS2 can be used in space since it can show better performance in the absence of absorbed vapour.399 In energy storage and conversion, highly applicable lithium rechargeable batteries (e.g., polypyrrole/MoS2 composites as a cathode material) and poly[oxymethylene-(oxyethylene)]/MoS2 composites are good examples since TMDs can enhance electrical conductivity.396,397 Furthermore, in the field of insulation, electronic packaging, power electronics, transmission lines and capacitors can be designed based on TMD/polymer composites (e.g., epoxy/MoS2). Such composites show considerable properties such as improved mechanical properties including strength, elastic modulus, toughness, creep, wear, and fatigue resistance without imparting electrical conductivity to the polymer matrix.342 The hybrid of MoS2 and other nanomaterials such as carbon nanotubes can lead to materials with superior flame retardancy properties. For example, MoS2-CNT/epoxy composites can lead to the reduction of the peak heat release rate and total heat release.340 Furthermore, a decrease in the amount of organic volatiles from matrix decomposition, suppressing smoke production and the formation of toxic gases such as carbon monoxide due to the inducing barrier effect and catalytic char function, can be considered as positive aspects of the use of TMDs. Poly(ethylene glycol)/MoS2 can be used for biomedical applications in multimodal imaging and synergistic therapy for cancer treatment. Relatively low cytotoxicity (except some elements such as tellurium), as well as their unique structural and chemical/physical properties, good dispersibility, high physiological stability, and biocompatibility, are some attractive features of TMDs in biomedical applications.65 The MoS2-Pebax/poly(dimethylsiloxane)/polysulfone membrane has shown improved permeability and selectivity with potential in gas separation technology. In such materials, MoS2 nanolayers have stronger adsorption energy of CO2, as compared to N2.302,398
4. Concluding remarks
Over the past few years, several research groups have investigated the large-scale production of 2D nanolayers from bulk forms. Compared to the bottom-up approach, top-down methods are much more feasible for commercialization. Among the top-down methods, the liquid-phase exfoliation with or without surfactant has received much attention. Although there has been considerable success in some cases, there are still challenges that need to be overcome. One of the elegant approaches in this regard is the method proposed by Varrla et al.,101 in which the post-processing steps associated with the size selection via centrifugation have been eliminated by controlling the nanolayer size during the exfoliation step and manipulating processing parameters such as surfactant concentration, rotor speed, liquid volume, MoS2 concentration, and the mixing time. This optimization is more efficient regarding energy and time consumption. Similarly, the work done by Coleman et al.61 indicated the success in the production of nanolayers by liquid exfoliation of layered materials. These methods, alongside electrochemical approaches, have the potential to be adopted by industry; nonetheless, the use of solvent, surfactant, and their relevant issues such as produced waste and toxicity could be limiting factors, especially when it comes to costs, so novel methods are highly required. Additionally, compared to other methods, although it is crystal clear that these abovementioned methods have higher yields, the concentration of the resulting product is still low for large-scale applications. Therefore, beneficial methods can be developed for TMDs to mitigate such problems. As an example, to overcome such issues, low-energy ball milling combined with sonication has been proposed by Yao et al.;104 although the yield was much improved in comparison with the aforementioned methods, the surfaces of produced nanolayers were still inert. Hence, the possibility of producing surface-functionalized TMD nanolayers from bulk materials in a one-step method via ball milling, which is applicable for potential large-scale production, can open new horizons for composite material developers. For example, Ahmadi et al.51 showed that the combination of the hydrothermal approach with ball milling can result in scalable synthesis and functionalization of amine-functionalized MoS2 nanolayers, which can act as reinforcements in different types of polymeric matrices. Such suggestions have already been roughly developed for graphene.400 The remaining questions for TMDs can be related to whether the methods used for the production of graphene with considerable yield (up to ∼30 mg mL−1)121 can be adopted for the scalable production of TMDs. Additionally, when dealing with composite preparation, only a limited number of studies have focused on the interface in nanocomposites, when compared to graphene. Therefore, the development of new methods to modify the surface of TMDs is required to improve the interface and provide additional functionalities to composites.51 TMDs (e.g. MoS2) are known to have a lubricating effect and this can present great opportunities in the investigation of matrix flow behaviors and wettability in the development of high-performance fibre-reinforced composites. Similar to other 2D materials (e.g. graphene and nanoclay),401–403 TMDs can potentially be used in the multi-scale interface modification of fibre-reinforced composites, either via addition to the matrix or deposition onto the fibres, leading to the introduction of multi-functionality to the polymeric composites.
Trends, shown in Fig. 16, clearly demonstrate the significant interest of the scientific community in exploring the tribological properties of TMDs (e.g. MoS2) until the year 2013. In the majority of these studies, the bulk form of TMDs has been used, which, more often than not, resulted in poor mechanical performance. Since 2013, when approaches for graphene development were employed for TMD nanolayers, the attention moved to the improvement of the mechanical performance of TMD composites. Therefore, research into the development of composites with both enhanced mechanical and tribological properties through the control of TMD nano-scale morphology could be a subject of future interest.

Progress in graphene research has not only opened up new horizons for TMDs in other applications, but also encourages researchers to focus on the multi-functionality aspect arising from TMD incorporation in composites. Through the manipulation of the number of TMD layers, their size, and dimensions, as well as their surface chemistry, one can tune the inherent properties of TMDs to achieve multi-functional composites. This will provide a platform for applications such as flame retardancy, optical and electrical/electronic fields in the near future.
