    , Accepted 31st May 2016First published on 10th June 2016AbstractA promising way to advance perovskite solar cells is to improve the quality of the electron transport material – e.g., titanium dioxide (TiO2) – in a direction that increases electron transport and extraction. Although dense TiO2 films are easily grown in solution, efficient electron extraction suffers due to a lack of interfacial contact area with the perovskites. Conversely, mesoporous films do offer high surface-area-to-volume ratios, thereby promoting efficient electron extraction, but their morphology is relatively difficult to control via conventional solution synthesis methods. Here, a pulsed laser deposition method was used to assemble TiO2 nanoparticles into TiO2 hierarchical architectures exhibiting an anatase crystal structure, and prototype solar cells employing these structures yielded power conversion efficiencies of ∼14%. Our approach demonstrates a way to grow high aspect-ratio TiO2 nanostructures for improved interfacial contact between TiO2 and perovskite materials, leading to high electron–hole pair separation and electron extraction efficiencies for superior photovoltaic performance. Compared to previous pulsed laser deposition-synthesized TiO2 mesoporous crystalline networks that needed post-thermal annealing at 500 °C to form mesoporous crystalline networks, our relatively low temperature (300 °C) TiO2 processing method may promote reduced energy-consumption during device fabrication, as well as enable compatibility with flexible polymer substrates such as polyimide.
It is remarkable that in as little as seven years, organometallic halide perovskite solar cells1–4 have been developed with certified power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of ∼22%, a value that is comparable to existing thin film photovoltaic technologies based on, for example, copper indium gallium selenide and cadmium telluride.5–8 To rival silicon based solar cells, however, tremendous effort has been focused on several critical matters in perovskite solar cells that include exciton and carrier dynamics,9–14 device operation mechanisms,15–19 morphology engineering,20–23 synthesis and processing of new perovskite materials,24–28 and electron or hole transport materials.29,30 Note that the light absorbing perovskite is usually sandwiched between hole transport and electron transport layers. Both are key factors to enable efficient separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs and extraction of free electrons and holes for high performance perovskite-based cells. In these devices, the most common hole transport materials are conducting organic materials such as 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis[N,N-di(p-methoxyphenylamine)]-9,9-spirobifluorene (Spiro-OMeTAD),2,3 poly[bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine] (PTAA),7 and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS).16 Another category of hole transport materials is inorganics such as molybdenum oxide (MoOx),31 nickel oxide (NiOx),32 vanadium oxide (V2O5),33 and tungsten trioxide (WO3).33 We note that inorganic films have been shown to perform better than organics in protecting the perovskite photoactive layer against ambient moisture induced degradation. For electron transport, the most widely used materials are fullerene derivatives16 and titanium dioxide (TiO2).34 Titanium dioxide, in particular, is normally applied in two different ways: dense thin films or as a mesoporous scaffold.2,3 Dense TiO2 films are readily grown in solution, but they suffer from the lack of sufficient interfacial contact area with the perovskites to ensure efficient electron extraction.35 In contrast, mesoporous scaffolds have high surface-to-volume ratios and light-scattering abilities that can significantly trap light within the photoactive layer and further enhance the optical absorption for increased photogenerated currents; however its morphology is difficult to control via conventional solution synthesis methods such as sol–gel36 or solvothermal synthesis.36,37
Pulsed laser deposition (PLD) is a widely used technique for epitaxial oxide thin film growth, and typically results in the formation of dense and continuous films when performed in vacuum.38 However, by spatial confinement of the ablation plume at relatively high background gas pressures, growth of nanoparticle assemblies in porous, hierarchical architectures can be achieved.39–41 Such hierarchical TiO2 nanostructures assembled at room temperature using PLD-synthesized TiO2 nanoparticles can be post-annealed at 500 °C to form mesoporous crystalline networks that have been used to achieve higher power conversion efficiencies in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), likely due to their larger surface area and stronger light scattering.42–44 These PLD-grown, post-annealed, three-dimensional TiO2 nanostructures have also been shown be good electron acceptors and transporters that have the potential to enhance exciton dissociation and photogenerated charge collection in high efficiency poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT)/TiO2 solar cells.45 However, in spite of this effort in applying TiO2 nanostructures in dye-sensitized and polymer solar cells, the use of PLD-synthesized TiO2 nanostructures in organometallic halide perovskite solar cells is still poorly studied.
Here, we report the PLD growth of hierarchical TiO2 films at relatively low (300 °C) substrate temperatures to enable the single-step fabrication of electrodes for high-efficiency perovskite solar cells that combine the advantages of both dense thin films and mesoporous scaffolds. The final structures exhibited high aspect-ratios, mesoporosity, and a crystalline phase that was predominantly anatase. Although significantly denser than the architectures deposited at room temperature, such TiO2 nanostructures were still porous, enabling rapid infiltration of the perovskite precursor solution. A prototype photovoltaic device yielded a PCE of 14%, demonstrating great promise for further photovoltaic applications.
To grow TiO2 nanostructures by PLD, a 248 nm laser beam was used to ablate a TiO2 target to deposit TiO2 nanoparticles (∼3–5 nm) in 200 mT of oxygen,46 onto an indium tin oxide (ITO) glass substrate positioned 5 cm away. As illustrated in Fig. 1a, the nanoparticle assemblies form a hierarchical TiO2 nanostructure. Fig. 1b and c show surface and cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images, respectively, of TiO2 nanostructures on a silicon substrate grown by this method at room temperature, showing a hierarchical nanostructure. The phase, structure, and degree of crystallinity were readily controlled by tuning the temperature of the ITO glass substrates on the heater stage. Fig. 1d and e show surface and cross-sectional morphologies of a PLD grown TiO2 film at 300 °C, respectively. Such TiO2 films are relatively porous as a result of the assembly of ∼3–5 nm size nanoparticles as demonstrated in our previous work.46 These pores allow the liquid perovskite precursors to diffuse into the TiO2 nanostructures for excellent interfacial contact between the nanoparticles and perovskites. Note that the use of low temperature (300 °C) induced crystallization of the TiO2 nanoparticles during deposition, but prevented the structure from forming a fully dense film, hence enabling both porosity and crystallinity. The degree of crystallinity, phase, and nanostructured morphology as a function of deposition conditions will be the subject of a separate publication.

X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Raman spectroscopy measurements were applied to examine the crystallinity of the PLD-deposited TiO2 films. As shown by the XRD patterns in Fig. 2a, the room-temperature-grown TiO2 structures showed amorphous characteristics, whereas the samples grown at higher substrate temperatures (300 °C) exhibited the onset of crystalline features of the anatase phase, as suggested by the appearance of a reflex at ∼25°. Raman spectroscopy studies further confirmed that the crystalline phase was anatase as evidenced by characteristic Raman peaks at ∼144, 399, and 639 cm−1.47 We note that our experiments showed that a deposition temperature of 300 °C was sufficient to form anatase during PLD, and is much lower than that (500 °C) required for conventional solution-processed TiO2 thin films18,34,48,49 and the post-annealing temperature (500 °C) needed for the formation of previous PLD-synthesized TiO2 mesoporous crystalline networks.42–44 Interestingly, our relatively low temperature TiO2 processing method may enable reduced energy consumption during fabrication of perovskite photovoltaics as well as pave the way for use of flexible polymer substrates such as polyimide.50 Note that the rutile and brookite phases of TiO2 are also able to be synthesized by our PLD method,46 but this requires much high growth temperature (>500 °C) and would degrade the ITO glass substrates by elemental diffusion – i.e., their optical and electronic properties would be degraded.51,52 Furthermore, such temperatures would induce sintering of our ∼3 nm nanoparticles to larger particles (∼15–50 nm), resulting in the reduction of surface area.46

To test the suitability of the porous, semicrystalline TiO2 nanostructured films deposited at 300 °C as an electron transporter in perovskite solar cells, we fabricated prototype solar cells using our previously established layer-by-layer processing method, whereby precursor inks were deposited followed by a room-temperature-air-exposure treatment.34 Specifically, a lead(II) iodide (PbI2) solution with a concentration of 550 mg mL−1 was dropped onto TiO2 layers, and in order to infiltrate the PbI2 solution into the porous region of the TiO2 layer, we waited for ∼5 seconds before spin-coating to remove excess material. After that, CH3NH3I (70 mg mL−1) was spin-coated, and then the device was left under ambient condition for an hour. Our previous study has demonstrated that ambient air exposure can sufficiently drive the interdiffusion between PbI2 and CH3NH3I layers to form perovskites after 1 hour.34 As indicated by the disappearance of the (001), (100), and (002) PbI2 reflexes and the appearance of the (110), (112), and (202) CH3NH3PbI3 reflexes, XRD confirmed complete transformation of the PbI2 precursor to CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite after 1 hour (Fig. 3).
 Fig. 3  X-ray diffraction pattern of the original PbI2/TiO2/ITO glass sample (blue) and final CH3NH3PbI3/TiO2/ITO glass sample (red) after 1 hour. The sample was made by spin-coating CH3NH3I solution onto the original PbI2/TiO2/ITO glass sample, and then exposing to air for 1 hour. 
In order to inspect whether the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite diffused into the pores of the TiO2, cross-sectional SEM images and associated energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) maps were acquired as shown in Fig. 4. In particular, the TiO2 nanostructures were observed to be ∼150 nm tall, and supported a CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite layer that was ∼250 nm thick (Fig. 4a). To determine if the perovskite infiltrated the TiO2 nanostructure, EDS maps were acquired as shown in Fig. 4b. It should be noted that the low resolution and contrast of the SEM image shown in Fig. 4b-i are due to charging caused by the 20 kV accelerating voltage used for EDS. We acquired EDS maps (Fig. 4b) for iodine (I), lead (Pb), titanium (Ti), and indium (In), and ascribed the images to the perovskite, TiO2, and ITO, respectively. The distribution region of In matches well with the ITO layer shown in Fig. 4b-i and -v. The TiO2 layer as indicated by the distribution of Ti (Fig. 4b-iv) is above the ITO layer, and more importantly, it appears that the distribution of Ti overlaps with the bottom part of the distribution of I and Pb (Fig. 4b-ii and -iii), suggesting the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite diffused into the TiO2 nanostructure. An EDS spectrum was also taken in the rectangular region as indicated in Fig. 4b-i, and the strong signals of Ti, O, Pb, and I further confirm that the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite is intermixed with the TiO2.

A series of TiO2 nanostructures with different thicknesses were used to make perovskite solar cells to study the effect of TiO2 thickness on cell efficiency, and their performance is shown in Fig. 5. The devices did exhibit hysteresis (Fig. 5a), making the PCE at forward to reverse bias, 13.6%, while that from reverse to forward bias, only 8.9%. In order to stabilize our devices and mitigate this effect, we soaked them under an illumination of 100 mW cm−2 at 1 V bias for 30 seconds. As shown in Fig. 5b, the J–V curves showed little change for four individual scans after soaking, and allowed us to accurately compare the devices with different TiO2 thicknesses. The origin of J–V hysteresis in our devices may be due to: (i) I− or CH3NH3+ ionic migration in the perovskite53,54 and (ii) charge trapping/release at surface trap states of the perovskite.16,55 The devices were stabilized by illuminating the device at bias of 1 V because the injected charges fill trap states in perovskites.16,56 Interestingly, devices based on 150 nm thick TiO2 showed a short circuit current density (JSC) of 20.1 mA cm−2, open circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.01 V, fill factor (FF) of 69%, and PCE of 14.1%. By increasing the thickness of the TiO2 layer to 200 nm, the photovoltaic performance showed little change. At 400 nm, however, the PCE decreased by about 20%, primarily due to a reduced VOC and FF. It should be pointed out that the decrease in both VOC and FF in the case of the thickest TiO2 is either likely due to the increased series resistance in the TiO2 electron transport layer or the direct contact of TiO2 with Spiro-OMeTAD. Based upon the TiO2 thickness dependence of device performance shown here, further improvement in PCE can be expected by optimizing the TiO2 nanostructure and morphology.

In conclusion, mesoporous TiO2 nanostructures grown by pulsed laser deposition at low substrate temperatures of 300 °C were explored as electron transport layers in perovskite solar cells, and were found to yield a PCE of ∼14%. The semicrystalline anatase TiO2 nanoparticle assembled nanostructures were found to have high surface area, thus ensuring high interfacial contact between the TiO2 and perovskite, and leading to high photovoltaic performance that was likely due to high exciton dissociation and charge extraction efficiencies. It is expected that further studies on optimizing the TiO2 nanostructure and morphology may enhance the device performance of perovskite solar cells beyond what was reported here. Compared to previous PLD-synthesized TiO2 mesoporous crystalline networks that needed post-thermal annealing at 500 °C to form mesoporous crystalline networks,42–44 our relatively low temperature (300 °C) TiO2 processing method may not only reduce energy consumption during the perovskite photovoltaic fabrication process, but offer compatibility with flexible polymer substrates such as polyimide.
Experimental section
Pulsed laser deposition
KrF-laser (248 nm) ablation of the TiO2 target with a laser fluence of 1 J cm−2 and repetition rate of 2 Hz in 200 mT of oxygen background gas pressure was used to synthesize the desired structures. ITO glass substrates were mounted onto a 1 inch button heater and heated to 300 °C which was suitable for the formation of anatase structures. The target to substrate distance was set to insure the plume tip just slightly reached the surface of the substrate, a condition suitable for the growth of these structures. Different thicknesses of TiO2 were prepared changing the number of laser pulses.
Thin film characterization
A Renishaw Raman spectroscopy system (532 nm excitation source focused onto the samples through a 50× 0.8 NA objective lens) was used to characterize the samples. An X-ray diffractometer (Panalytical X'Pert MPD Pro) with Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 1.54050 Å) was used to acquire XRD patterns. A scanning electron microscope (Zeiss Merlin) was used to acquire the SEM images. Accelerating voltages of 5 kV and 3 kV were used to acquire surface and cross-sectional SEM images respectively. An accelerating voltage of 20 kV was used to acquire EDS maps with a sample stage tilt angle of 15°.
Device fabrication and characterization
The TiO2 nanostructures were grown on precleaned ITO glass substrates. The 550 mg mL−1 PbI2 solution (use dimethylformamide as a solvent) was then dropped onto the TiO2 films. After waiting for 5 seconds to allow the PbI2 solution to diffuse into the TiO2 nanostructures, the sample was spun at 6000 rpm to remove excess PbI2. CH3NH3I solution (70 mg mL−1, 2-propanol used as a solvent) was subsequently spun onto the PbI2. The samples were then placed in ambient air for 1 hour to ensure the PbI2 precursor transformed into the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite. Spiro-OMeTAD solution (90 mg mL−1, chlorobenzene used as a solvent) was spun at 2000 rpm, and then kept in a desiccator overnight. Finally, a 100 nm-thick silver film was evaporated with a rate of 1 Å s−1. The active area was ∼6.5 mm2, which was determined by optical microscopy. The J–V curves were collected under an illumination 100 mW cm−2, AM 1.5 G solar spectrum, (Radiant Source Technology, 300 W, Class A) using a Keithley 2400 source meter. The light intensity was calibrated using a NIST-certified Si-reference cell. The J–V curves were obtained by scanning from forward bias to reverse bias and then from reverse bias to forward bias, with a 50 ms sweep delay time. Prior to measurements, the devices were soaked under illumination (100 mW cm−2) at a voltage bias of ∼1 V for 30 seconds to stabilize the photovoltaic performance. The measurements were conducted in a N2-filled glovebox.

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  Growth of TiO2 nanoarchitectures by pulsed laser deposition: (a) schematic showing the growth process of TiO2 on a heated ITO glass substrate surface (b) and cross-sectional (c) SEM image of the TiO2 architecture of assembled 3–5 nm nanoparticles deposited on a silicon substrate by PLD at room temperature. Surface (d) and cross-sectional (e) SEM image of the TiO2 nanostructure deposited on an ITO glass substrate by PLD under similar conditions, but at 300 °C. The scale bar in (b–e) is 200 nm.	 

 	Fig. 2  Crystallinity of TiO2 films. XRD pattern (a) and Raman spectra (b) acquired from TiO2 film grown on a silicon substrate at room temperature (blue) and 300 °C (red). Both methods indicate the formation of an anatase structure when the substrate temperature was 300 °C.	 

 	Fig. 3  X-ray diffraction pattern of the original PbI2/TiO2/ITO glass sample (blue) and final CH3NH3PbI3/TiO2/ITO glass sample (red) after 1 hour. The sample was made by spin-coating CH3NH3I solution onto the original PbI2/TiO2/ITO glass sample, and then exposing to air for 1 hour.	 

 	Fig. 4  (a) Cross-sectional morphology of an ITO glass/TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite sample. (b and c) Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy analysis: (b-i) SEM image and corresponding EDS images for iodine (b-ii), lead (b-iii), titanium (b-iv), and indium (b-v); (c) EDS spectrum acquired in the square region as indicated in (b-i).	 

 	Fig. 5  Photovoltaic performance (J–V curves) of perovskite devices. (a) Hysteresis of J–V curves acquired from scanning from forward bias to reverse bias and then from reverse bias to forward bias. (b) J–V curves with multiple scans after illumination soaking process showing negligible difference. (c) J–V curve of the devices with different TiO2 thicknesses.
