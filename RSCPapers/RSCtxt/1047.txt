    , Accepted 15th May 2018First published on 18th May 2018AbstractMultinary chalcogenide semiconductors (MCSs) recently emerged as a promising alternative to their binary counterparts for designing innovative solar energy conversion platforms due to a number of advantages including high absorption coefficient over a broad spectral range, conveniently tunable band structures through alloying, and nontoxicity for their use in real-world settings. The integration of MCSs with plasmonic metals into heteronanostructures is essential for promoting their light harvesting and conversion performance; however it is constrained by the large synthetic impediment arising from the incompatible activities of multiple precursors involved in growing the MCS domain via direct synthesis. Here using Au@Ag2ZnSnS4 core–shell nanocrystals (NCs) as a proof-of-concept demonstration, we report a new synthetic tactic based on cation exchange to access metal@MCS hybrid NCs with exceptional uniformity and precise control over the structural characteristics (both dimensions and morphology) in an aqueous environment. The prepared materials were explored as photoanodes for photoelectrochemical (PEC) hydrogen evolution, and the results suggested that our approach offers a good opportunity to unravel the delicate links between solar energy conversion efficiency and the structure of metal@MCS NCs. In view of the great versatility of cation exchange, we envision that this approach can be extended to fabricate a wide variety of metal@MCS NCs with unprecedented structures and functions.
1. Introduction
I–III–VI2 and I2–II–IV–VI4 (I = Cu, Ag; II = Zn; III = Ga, In; IV = Ge, Sn; VI = S, Se, Te) multinary chalcogenide semiconductors (MCSs) composed of nontoxic elements are promising candidates for replacing classical cadmium and lead chalcogenides in developing solar energy conversion technologies including photovoltaics, photocatalysis, and photoelectrochemical (PEC) fuel generation.1–6 For instance, CuInxGa1−xSe2 (CIGSe) and Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) that exhibit high absorption coefficients (>104 cm−1) over a broad range of the solar spectrum, flexibly tunable band gaps, and excellent power conversion efficiency, are two prominent representatives of the next generation of thin film solar cell materials.3,7–13 On the other hand, the remarkable potential of these visible-light-active and environmentally benign semiconductors in converting solar energy into hydrogen through photocatalytic or photoelectrochemical water splitting, has increasingly drawn significant interest.2,4,14–21 Taking I2–II–IV–VI4 semiconductors as an example, Kudo and coworkers systematically investigated the effects of constituent elements and crystal structures of a series of I2–II–IV–VI4 metal chalcogenides on their photophysical and photocatalytic properties. They demonstrated that Ag2ZnSnS4 (AZTS) was an especially unique photocatalytic material for H2 evolution because of the ideal equilibrium between its narrow band gap (Eg = 2.0 eV) and the large driving forces for water reduction (ECB = ∼−0.67 V vs. NHE).15
In the last decade, the integration of semiconductors with plasmonic metals (such as Au) forming hybrid nanostructures has been brought to the forefront for boosting the efficiency of solar energy harvesting and conversion.22–31 It has been corroborated that the plasmonic energy of metal nanocrystals (NCs) associated with their surface plasmon resonance (SPR) can be delivered to adjacent semiconductors via either a SPR-induced hot carrier transfer process,32–38 or an electromagnetic field-mediated plasmon energy transfer process.39,40 Such synergistic coupling between the exciton of the semiconductor and the plasmon of the metal induced remarkably enhanced light absorption, charge carrier generation and separation over various combinations of metal and semiconductor materials.41–51 For the nanocomposites constituted by I2–II–IV–VI4 semiconductors and plasmonic metals, in 2014 Cobat and coworkers found that the CZTS NCs with Au or Pt particles (2 nm) dispersed on their surface showed enhanced photocatalytic H2 production when compared to pure CZTS.52 At the very same time, Lee and Wong reported the first example of fabricating Au@CZTS core–shell nanostructures which displayed promotion effects on both photocurrent generation and photocatalytic hydrogen evolution due to the presence of Au.53 These studies stimulated a recent surge in creating more versatile Au–CZTS hybrid nanostructures, including CZTS nanorods dispersed with Au particles, and Au–CZTS heterodimers.52–59
It is known that the shape and size of the plasmonic metal, the structural properties of the semiconductor, and the geometrical configuration of the two constituents in hybrid nanostructures all play essential roles in achieving efficient plasmon–exciton coupling. However, because the nucleation and growth of quaternary chalcogenide semiconductors relies on reactions between multiple precursors with different reactivities, integrating metals and I2–II–IV–VI4 semiconductors having incompatible chemical and physical properties into a single building block presents a more tremendous synthetic challenge than the cases involving binary semiconductors. This explains the great impediments to the current synthetic strategies based on seeded growth (via post-modification or one-pot hot injection), which can hardly realize precise control of the structural parameters of the metal and semiconductor at the same time, particularly when they are arranged in a core–shell architecture to facilitate plasmon–exciton communications. Besides, oleylamine and dodecanethiol are unavoidably used in these synthetic methods. Such strong-binding non-conductive ligands make the resultant products difficult to disperse in aqueous media, and cause large obstacles for charge transport between individual NCs.1,60,61 The above issues indicate that developing new reliable synthetic routes is greatly desirable for attaining enhanced functions of the hybrid nanostructures constituted by plasmonic metals and MCSs.
Nanoscopic cation exchange, which depicts the substitution of cations in host NCs with the desired guest cations in solution, has become an increasingly versatile toolkit for modifying the composition of NCs with their structure and morphology being well preserved.62,63 It often involves low temperature transformation, and allows nanomaterials with finely-controlled size and shape that are synthesized by conventional methods to be used as templates, for the generation of compositionally more complex NCs through kinetically-controlled topotactic conversion. Therefore, cation exchange can provide a promising means to design nanocrystal compositions that are not readily accessible by direct synthesis, such as multicomponent alloyed NCs, while they need to be precisely engineered in dimension and shape to endow them with well-defined optical, electronic and catalytic features.64–66
Here using Au@AZTS core–shell NCs as a proof-of-concept demonstration, we show the first example that aqueous cation exchange is an effective protocol for integration of plasmonic metals and MCSs into heteronanostructures. In the resulting Au@AZTS core–shell NCs which have exceptional monodispersity, the dimensions of both metal and semiconductor constituents can be independently tuned as pre-designed with nanometer-level precision, and the morphology of the hybrid NCs can also be flexibly tuned (spherical and rod-like). These Au@AZTS NCs prepared in aqueous phase are suitable to be exploited as photoanode materials for PEC water splitting. Our results revealed that the judicious control of the physical parameters (core shape, core size, and shell thickness) of the Au@AZTS core–shell NCs, which is enabled by the new synthetic strategy and not readily available otherwise, provides a valuable knob for modulating the coupling between constituents and promoting the solar-to-fuel conversion efficiency in PEC cells.
2. Experimental
2.1 Synthesis of Au colloidal NCs in aqueous phase
Au NCs were synthesized by seed-mediated growth in aqueous phase. As for the spherical Au colloids, a seed solution containing HAuCl4·4H2O (1.25 mL, 1 mM) and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB, 2.5 mL, 0.15 M) was first prepared in a 50 mL centrifuge tube, followed by the addition of ice-cold NaBH4 (0.3 mL, 0.01 M) under vigorous magnetic stirring for 2 min. The resulting mixture was kept at 25 °C for 1 hour. The Au growth solution was prepared by dissolving HAuCl4·4H2O (0.8 mL, 0.01 M) and CTAB (6.4 mL, 0.1 M) in deionized water (32 mL). Afterwards, ascorbic acid (3.8 mL, 0.1 M) solution was introduced, followed by addition of the seed solution (40–800 μL, according to the desired diameter of the Au colloids) immediately. With respect to the rod-like Au colloids, the seed solution was prepared by reducing HAuCl4 (25 μL, 0.1 M) with ice-cold NaBH4 (60 μL, 0.1 M) in an aqueous solution containing CTAB (10 mL, 0.1 M) under vigorous stirring. The resulting solution was aged at 30 °C for 1 h. The growth solution was prepared by first dissolving CTAB (3.6 g) and potassium bromide (1.4 g) in deionized water (100 mL). After being kept at 60 °C for 1 h and then at 30 °C for another 1 h with continuous stirring, AgNO3 (4.8 mL, 4 mM) and HAuCl4 aqueous solutions (100 mL, 1 mM) were added sequentially. Thereafter, ascorbic acid (1.8 mL, 64 mM) was introduced, followed by the addition of the prepared seed solution (0.32 mL) immediately under stirring. The obtained mixture was kept at room temperature for 12 h.
2.2 Synthesis of Au@Ag2S core–shell NCs in aqueous phase
The as-prepared Au colloids were washed with deionized water, collected by centrifugation at 7000 rpm for 10 min, and re-dispersed in CTAB aqueous solution (10 mL, 25 mM). Afterwards, ascorbic acid (0.7 mL, 0.1 M), AgNO3 (0.01 M, 0.3–1 mL, depending on the desired shell thickness), and NaOH aqueous solution (1 mL, 0.1 M) were sequentially added to the obtained Au colloid solution at room temperature to grow a uniform Ag layer surrounding the Au colloids. The sulfur precursor was also prepared in aqueous phase. Na2S aqueous solution (11.7 mL, 50 mM) and sulfur powder (32 mg) were added into a 50 mL centrifuge tube, forming a bright yellow solution after ultrasonication treatment. The mixture was then transferred into an autoclave (15 mL) and was kept at 80 °C for 12 h. A desired volume (100 μL) of the resulting sulfur precursor solution was added to the formed Au@Ag core–shell colloid solution under magnetic stirring for 10 min and was then kept at room temperature for 1 h. The final resulting Au@Ag2S core–shell colloids were washed with deionized water, collected by centrifugation at 7000 rpm for 10 min, and re-dispersed in CTAB aqueous solution (10 mL, 50 mM) for the following use.
2.3 Cation exchange in aqueous phase to produce Au@AZTS core–shell NCs
For the preparation of spherical Au@AZTS core–shell NCs, Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (0.18–0.6 mL, 0.1 g mL−1) and SnCl2·2H2O aqueous solutions (0.068–0.23 mL, 0.01 g mL−1, the amount of the salt solutions proportional to the shell thickness of the core–shell NCs) were added to the prepared Au@Ag2S aqueous suspension simultaneously, followed by the addition of trioctylphosphine (TOP, 0.05 mL) dissolved in a minor amount of methanol. After stirring for 1 min, the mixture was transferred to a water bath and was kept at 60 °C for 2 h. The final colloid solution was washed with deionized water, collected by centrifugation at 7000 rpm for 10 min, and re-dispersed in pure water. For the preparation of the rod-like Au@AZTS core–shell NCs, similar procedures were used as those of the spherical Au@AZTS core–shell NCs except for using Au nanorods as the starting materials.
2.4 Characterization
Low-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of the samples were obtained using a HITACHI H-7650 (accelerating voltage of 80 kV) electron microscope. In this process, aqueous sol samples were dropped onto a copper mesh (300 mesh, carbon support film), and dried at room temperature. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) characterization and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) analysis were performed using a transmission electron microscope (FEI Tecnai G2 F20 S-Twin, an acceleration voltage of 200 kV) equipped with an X-ray energy-dispersive spectroscopy detector. The inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) analysis was conducted on a ThermoFisher X II spectrometer. The powder X-ray diffraction measurements were performed using a Bruker D8 multiply crystals X-ray diffractometer (5° per min). UV-vis measurements were carried out on a Shimadzu UV3600 UV-vis spectrophotometer at room temperature. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses were performed on a PerkinElmer Physics PHI 5300 spectrometer. The visible Raman spectrum was collected on a Renishaw inVia Raman microscope with a 633 nm excitation laser (power 1 mW) which focused on the sample area with a diameter of 2–3 μm and an integration time of 30 s. The UV Raman spectrum was recorded on a home-assembled UV Raman spectrograph using a Jobin-Yvon T64000 triple-stage spectrograph with a spectral resolution of 2 cm−1. The laser line at 325 nm of an He–Cd laser was used as an exciting source with an output of 50 mW. The power of the laser at samples was about 1.0 mW.
2.5 Photoelectrochemical (PEC) measurements and hydrogen evolution
PEC measurements were performed using a standard three-electrode potentiostat system (CHI760c, Chenghua, Shanghai, China) with a Pt counter electrode and a Ag/AgCl reference electrode. The working electrode was prepared by depositing Au@AZTS core–shell NCs on a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrate. Specifically, the FTO substrate (1 cm × 2 cm) was thoroughly cleaned with ethanol and water before use. 1.5 mg of Au@AZTS core–shell NCs were dispersed in 1 mL of deionized water to form a homogeneous dispersion, and then were carefully deposited onto the FTO substrate by spray coating at a speed of 0.05 mL min−1. The surface area of the sample exposed to the electrolyte was fixed at 1 cm × 1 cm. Prior to the PEC measurements, the obtained Au@AZTS/FTO photoanode was annealed in a N2 atmosphere at 200 °C for 1 h to strengthen the contact between the active material and the substrate. An aqueous solution containing 0.5 M Na2S and 0.5 M Na2SO3 was used as the electrolyte to maintain the stability of the sulfide electrodes. The working electrode was illuminated from the front side with a 300 W Xe lamp (PLS-SXE300, Beijing Perfectlight Technology) equipped with an optical filter (PLS-CUT420, λ > 420 nm), and the illumination intensity near the photoelectrode surface was 200 mW cm−2. PEC hydrogen evolution experiments were performed in a Pyrex reaction cell connected to a closed gas circulation and evacuation system (Labsolar 6A, Beijing Perfectlight Technology) under the same conditions as for the photocurrent measurements. The system was thoroughly degassed before being irradiated with a 300 W Xe lamp (PLS-SXE300, Beijing Perfectlight Technology) equipped with an optical filter (PLS-CUT420, λ > 420 nm). The reaction cell was maintained at 15 °C using a cooling water bath during the reaction. The evolved amounts of H2 were analyzed using a gas chromatograph (Agilent 7890B GC system) with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and a molecular sieve 5A column.
2.6 Incident-photon-to-current-conversion efficiency (IPCE) measurements
IPCE spectra were recorded on a QE/IPCE Measurement Kit (Crowntech QTest Station 1000AD) with a tungsten halogen lamp (CT-TH-150), a calibrated silicon diode, and a monochromator (Crowntech QEM24-S 1/4 m). The light power density was calibrated against a Si solar cell (Hamamatsu S1133) to accurately simulate the light to 100 mW cm−2. A two-electrode system was used with Pt as a counter electrode. An aqueous solution containing 0.5 M Na2S and 0.5 M Na2SO3 was used as the electrolyte. IPCE can be calculated using the following equation, where λ is the wavelength of the incident light, I is the measured photocurrent density at the specific wavelength, and J is the measured power intensity of the incident light at the specific wavelength.IPCE(λ) = [1240 × I (mA cm−2)]/[λ (nm) × J (W cm−2)] × 100%
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Synthesis protocol and characterization of Au@AZTS core–shell NCs
The steps of the synthesis protocol are illustrated in Fig. 1a. Aqueous colloids of shape- and size-controlled Au NCs are used as the starting materials (Fig. S1†). Benefiting from the perfect-matched lattice constants between Au and Ag, an Ag overlayer can be grown around the Au NCs with precise thickness control down to a single monolayer.67 Then, by reacting with sulfur precursors (S powder and Na2S aqueous solution), the formed Ag overlayer is topotactically converted into an amorphous Ag2S shell (for characterization details see Fig. S2†). Finally, partial replacement of the silver cations in the Ag2S shell matrix with the zinc and tin cations in aqueous solution assisted by trioctylphosphine (TOP, dissolved in a minor amount of methanol), gives birth to the Au@AZTS core–shell NCs. More specifically, according to the hard and soft acids and bases theory, here silver cations behave as a strong acid in comparison with the zinc and tin cations. On the other hand, TOP is a soft base which can strongly coordinate with the silver cations to form organometallic complexes, initiating the exchange reactions between silver cations in the amorphous shell matrix and the zinc and tin cations dissolved in the aqueous solution. The extent of the above cation exchange processes can be manipulated through kinetic control to render partial replacement of silver with the guest cations and yield quaternary chalcogenide semiconductor shells. It is remarkable that under the elaborately designed synthetic conditions, the free energy released during the cation exchange process can induce reorganization of the lattice structures of the shell matrix generating crystalline domains, consistent with our previous studies.68,69

As manifested by the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image in Fig. 1b, the final products have an obvious core–shell structure with the spherical core completely covered by a uniform shell layer. For this sample, the diameter of the embedded core was measured to be 38.0 ± 1.3 nm and the thickness of the shell was 5.2 ± 0.5 nm, displaying highly narrow size distributions in comparison with the reported metal@I2–II–IV–VI4 core–shell nanostructures.53,57,59 The high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images in Fig. 1c and d disclose the intimate interface between the core and the shell, which promises to facilitate efficient charge transfer between the two phases. Moreover, the high crystallinity of the shell is clearly observed, where the interplanar spacing measured as 0.330 nm can be attributed to the (112) plane of the tetragonal AZTS. Combined with the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern in Fig. S3† which shows four strong diffraction peaks corresponding to cubic Au (JCPDS 04-0784) and two discernable diffraction peaks assignable to the (112) and (312) planes of tetragonal Ag2ZnSnS4 (JCPDS 35-0544), it is rational to conclude that the final core–shell products have a cubic Au core and a tetragonal AZTS shell. This conclusion was further supported by high-angle dark-field (HAADF) scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) imaging in conjunction with energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) elemental mapping. The results exhibited in Fig. 1e–j revealed the co-existence of Au and the four elements in AZTS, with Au located in the core region and the atoms of Ag, Zn, Sn, and S evenly distributed in the shell. The elemental ratio of Ag:Zn:Sn:S was determined to be 1.82:0.41:1.77:4 by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) measurements, indicating a Zn-poor and Sn-rich feature. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was conducted to investigate the oxidation states of the elements in the shell (Fig. S4†). The XPS survey spectrum identified the existence of Ag, Zn, Sn, S and C. Two characteristic Ag 3d peaks located at 367.6 eV and 373.6 eV indicate the presence of Ag(I). The Zn(II) state is confirmed by the peaks at 1021.7 eV and 1044.8 eV. The binding energy peaks at 486.6 eV and 495.0 eV with a peak separation of 8.4 eV can be ascribed to the Sn(IV) state. The peaks at 161.7 eV and 162.8 eV are in agreement with the presence of sulfide species.53,70–73 As shown in Fig. 1k, comparison of the UV-vis extinction spectra of the bare spherical Au colloids and the Au@AZTS core–shell NCs suggested that the formation of an AZTS shell (thickness of 5.2 ± 0.5 nm) around a Au core (diameter of 38.0 ± 1.3 nm) lead to a marked red-shift of the SPR peak from 529 to 605 nm.
Raman spectrum analysis has been demonstrated to be a powerful tool for quaternary chalcogenide determination due to its capability to distinguish quaternary chalcogenide from other binary and ternary chalcogenides.1,19,53,64,74 In our study, more in-depth characterization on the phase purity of the synthesized materials was assisted by Raman spectroscopy measurements. Fig. 2a presents the visible Raman spectrum of the Au@AZTS core–shell NCs with an excitation wavelength of 633 nm. The characteristic peak at 338 cm−1 is well consistent with the reported value for the lattice vibration of tetragonal AZTS.75,76 No additional peaks assigned to ZnS (274 and 351 cm−1), SnS2 (315 cm−1), SnS (190–220 cm−1), Ag2S (250 cm−1) and Ag8SnS6 (221 and 310 cm−1) were observed indicating the absence or very low extent of other impurities.19,53,64,74–76 It might be argued that the visible Raman spectroscopy has a weak sensitivity for detecting the ZnS impurity phase.19 To clarify this issue, ultraviolet Raman spectroscopy was exploited to further identify the structural homogeneity of the sample. Fig. 2b shows the ultraviolet Raman spectrum of the Au@AZTS NCs excited by a laser with a wavelength of 325 nm, where only a sharp peak located at 338 cm−1 was observed without the presence of any characteristic modes of the ZnS phase. The combination of visible and ultraviolet Raman analysis provided convincing evidence that quaternary chalcogenide AZTS is the dominant phase constituting the shell structure. Taken together, the above characterization results suggested that the synthetic protocol proposed in this work offers an effective approach to grow Au@AZTS core–shell NCs with high geometrical uniformity in aqueous phase. It should be pointed out that the cation exchange reactions exploited to generate I2–II–IV–VI4 NCs from binary or ternary templates are often carried out in oleylamine using a long-chain alkanethiol as the coordinating ligand.64,65 Our study demonstrates the feasibility of aqueous cation exchange to fabricate MCS NCs even when they are integrated with metals in nanostructures.

3.2 Precise control over the structural characteristics of Au@AZTS core–shell NCs
The synthetic versatility of the proposed method for accessing metal@I2–II–IV–VI4 core–shell NCs with controlled structural parameters was first demonstrated by the precise modulation of their core sizes and shell thicknesses, respectively. By taking advantage of the great progress in synthesizing aqueous Au colloids with well-defined dimensions,77,78 the Au core size in Au@AZTS NCs can be accurately tuned as desired besides the representative sample (38 ± 1.3 nm) shown in Fig. 1. Fig. 3a–c exhibit the TEM images of the spherical Au@AZTS core–shell NCs prepared from Au colloids with dimensions varied at 13.0 ± 2.6, 17.5 ± 1.8 and 23.3 ± 1.5 nm, respectively. Irrespective of the alterations in the Au core size, the shell thickness of these samples basically remained the same (4.3 ± 0.2, 3.9 ± 0.1, and 4.2 ± 0.2 nm, correspondingly). On the other hand, beneficial from the in situ topotactical conversion from Au@Ag to Au@AZTS, adjusting the amount of AgNO3 in growing Au@Ag NCs sensitively determined the thickness of the AZTS shell in the final products. As displayed in Fig. 3d–f, the shell thickness of these samples was modulated at 7.2 ± 0.8, 9.1 ± 1.0, and 10.2 ± 2.6 nm respectively, with their Au core size unchanged at 38.0 ± 1.3 nm. These results manifest the unique advantage of the proposed method in selectively controlling the dimensions of both metals and MCSs in a pre-designable way without sacrificing the uniformity of the hybrid NCs. This is essentially important for modulating the SPR function of plasmonic metals and attaining enhanced plasmon–exciton interactions. For example, as the Au core size was gradually increased from 13.0 ± 2.6 to 38.0 ± 1.3 nm (Fig. 3a–c and 1b), the SPR peaks of these samples showed a delicate red-shift from 570 to 605 nm (Fig. 3g). The fine tuning of the thickness of the AZTS shell also enabled sensitive modulation of the plasmonic resonance. With the Au core size fixed at 38.0 ± 1.3 nm and the shell thickness increased from 5.2 ± 0.5 to 10.2 ± 2.6 nm (Fig. 3d–f and 1b), the SPR peaks can be further red-shifted to 650 nm (Fig. 3h).

(d–f) TEM images of the spherical Au@AZTS core–shell NCs with core size maintained at 38 nm and shell thicknesses precisely modulated at (d) 7.2 ± 0.8, (e) 9.1 ± 1.0, and (f) 10.2 ± 2.6 nm respectively, and (h) the corresponding normalized extinction spectra. The black lines in (g) and (h) correspond to the sample shown in Fig. 1(b). 
The flexibility of our method in tailoring the morphology of the Au@AZTS core–shell NCs was investigated by taking one-dimensional nanorods (NRs) as a demonstration. According to our knowledge, this is the first study on synthesizing metal@I2–II–IV–VI4 core–shell NCs with anisotropic morphologies. Using monodispersed Au NRs as the starting materials (Fig. S5†), the core–shell nanostructures with a rod-like morphology can be obtained following the same synthetic scheme as illustrated in Fig. 1a. In Fig. 4a, the TEM image reveals the formation of the core–shell NRs with a finely controlled morphology and shell thickness. For this sample, the average length and width of the rod-like cores were measured to be 39.4 ± 6.6 and 12.5 ± 2.0 nm, respectively, and the shell thickness was7.3 ± 0.9 nm. The HRTEM images of the shell domain show a lattice spacing of 0.329 nm (Fig. 4b and c), which is in agreement with the (112) plane of the tetragonal AZTS indicating the crystalline nature of the shell. The EDX elemental mapping analysis was conducted to further confirm the composition of the sample. Fig. 4d–i show the presence of elemental Au, Ag, Zn, Sn, and S with a clear distribution of Au in the core. It is known that one-dimensional Au NRs exhibit excellent tunable NIR absorption capabilities depending on the aspect ratio between the length and width of the NRs. According to Fig. 4j, the transverse and longitudinal plasmon resonances of the original Au NRs were centered at 516 and 784 nm, respectively. Upon being coated with a homogeneous layer of the AZTS shell, the transverse and longitudinal SPR wavelength maxima were red-shifted to 578 and 957 nm, respectively, displaying strong absorption in the visible-NIR region. It is expected that by judiciously tailoring the aspect ratio of the Au NRs and the thickness of the AZTS shells, the Au@AZTS core–shell NRs can interact with an even broader solar spectrum. Overall, the ability to precisely control the dimension and morphology of the Au@AZTS core–shell NCs offers great flexibility in designing efficient solar energy conversion materials.

3.3 Photoelectrochemical (PEC) hydrogen generation based on Au@AZTS core–shell photoanodes with modulated structures
Benefitting from the capability to judiciously engineer the structural properties of aqueous-dispersible Au@AZTS core–shell NCs, we further adopted these materials as photoanodes (AZTS possesses n-type conductivity),79 and explored the impacts of structural tuning on the PEC performance of the metal@I2–II–IV–VI4 hybrid nanostructures. Firstly, three samples with a spherical morphology were selected, where the core size/shell thickness was controlled at 17.5 ± 1.8/3.9 ± 0.1, 38.0 ± 1.3/5.2 ± 0.5 nm, and 38.0 ± 1.3/9.1 ± 1.0 nm, respectively (corresponding to Fig. 3b, 1b and 3e). Their PEC properties were evaluated using a standard three-electrode system under visible light illumination (λ > 420 nm) in an aqueous solution containing 0.5 M Na2S and 0.5 M Na2SO3. Fig. 5a shows the photocurrent–potential characteristics of the three samples with a chopped light source. For each sample, a sharp increase in the photocurrent toward the positive direction was observed upon illumination, which reverted to the initial stage immediately after the illumination was turned off. It can be seen that the photoelectrochemical response was improved when increasing the Au core size from 17.5 to 38.0 nm. Through tailoring the shell thickness from 5.2 to 9.1 nm with the Au core size fixed at 38.0 nm, an even higher photocurrent density was achieved. These results indicated that the structural parameters of the Au@AZTS core–shell photoanodes have a significant impact on their PEC activities, probably due to the different plasmon–exciton coupling efficiencies arising from the changed structural and electronic properties of the metal and semiconductor components.23,24,41,51,80–83 As exhibited in Fig. 5b, the long time chronoamperometry measurements at an applied potential of 0 V vs. Ag/AgCl suggested the good stability of these photoanode materials.

(c) The time course of H2 evolution for the spherical Au@AZTS core–shell photoanode (core size of 38.0 ± 1.3 nm and shell thickness of 9.1 ± 1.0 nm) under a bias of 0 V vs. Ag/AgCl. The dashed line (e−/2) is the expected amount of hydrogen evolved calculated from the measured photocurrent (the amount of electrons passing through the external circuit) assuming 100% faradaic efficiency. (d) IPCE spectrum (blue) and extinction spectrum (red) of the spherical Au@AZTS core–shell photoanode (core size of 38.0 ± 1.3 nm and shell thickness of 9.1 ± 1.0 nm). 
Taking the Au@AZTS core–shell NCs with a core size of 38.0 ± 1.3 nm and a shell thickness of 9.1 ± 1.0 nm (the optimal structural design among the three samples) as a representative, PEC hydrogen evolution was assayed at an applied potential of 0 V vs. Ag/AgCl using an on-line gas chromatograph. Although metal chalcogenide photoanodes often suffer from poor stability because of photocorrosion, in Fig. 5c a stable PEC H2 evolution was observed for the duration of the measurement, and this was also evidenced by the XPS analysis before and after the hydrogen evolution test (Fig. S6†). These results implied that in this PEC reaction system, the photogenerated holes can be rapidly eliminated by the sacrificial agents (S2−/SO32−) while the photogenerated electrons effectively migrate to the Pt counter electrode and produce H2 there by reacting with H+ in the water. After 3 hours of visible light irradiation, about 130 μmol H2 gas was collected. It is worthwhile to note that the amount of H2 evolved was very close to the theoretical value (e−/2, half of the amount of electrons passing through the external circuit) calculated from the measured photocurrent assuming 100% faradaic efficiency (Fig. 5c). Furthermore, incident-photon-to-current-conversion efficiency (IPCE) measurements were performed to investigate the change of photoresponse as a function of incident light wavelength. As presented in Fig. 5d, an evident enhancement peak centered at 630 nm was observed, which is in good agreement with the SPR peak of the sample. Such observations strongly suggested that the photon energy absorbed by the plasmon resonance of the Au core can be delivered to the AZTS shell through efficient plasmon–exciton interactions, leading to enhanced light harvesting and charge carrier generation that contribute to the increase in solar energy conversion efficiency.48,84,85
Finally, we show the first demonstration of exploring the anisotropic metal@I2–II–IV–VI4 core–shell NCs as photoanodes for PEC hydrogen evolution on account of the prepared Au@AZTS core–shell NRs. From Fig. 6a and b, the photocurrent density of the rod-like Au@AZTS photoanode was slightly lower than its spherical counterpart with an optimal core size and shell thickness (2.28 vs. 2.75 mA cm−2 at an applied potential of 0 V vs. Ag/AgCl). After 3 hours of visible light irradiation, the total amount of H2 evolved was about 80 μmol, comparable to the theoretical value with the faradaic efficiency calculated at 93% (Fig. 6c). The decreased photocurrent and H2 evolution after about 30 min of light illumination probably suggested the occurrence of hole-induced anodic corrosion.86 It is presumed that judicious manipulation of the dimensions and aspect ratio of the core and thickness of the shell could ameliorate the function of the rod-like Au@AZTS core–shell NCs giving enhanced PEC activity and stability, and research studies in this direction are underway in our group.

(c) The time course of H2 evolution for the rod-like Au@AZTS core–shell photoanode under a bias of 0 V vs. Ag/AgCl.

4. Conclusions
In conclusion, here we report a new synthetic approach based on aqueous cation exchange to fabricate highly uniform and well-defined Au@AZTS core–shell NCs as efficient photoanode materials for PEC hydrogen generation. Benefiting from the unique merits of cation exchange, the proposed approach circumvents the limitations of conventional seeded growth methods and realizes unprecedented control over the structural parameters (both dimension and morphology) of the Au@AZTS hybrid NCs in aqueous media. Such synthetic advantages provide a great deal of flexibility in tuning the electronic and optical properties of both the plasmonic metal and the quaternary chalcogenide semiconductor as well as their coupling manners. The different PEC performance of the Au@AZTS core–shell NCs with adjusted core sizes, shell thicknesses and morphologies, demonstrated that our synthetic strategy featuring high controllability over the geometrical characteristics of hybrid NCs is of great significance for fully harnessing the SPR function and achieving efficient solar energy conversion in the heteronanostructures composed of plasmonic metals and MCSs. We envision that the proposed synthetic strategy can be extended to controlled synthesis of more versatile metal@MCS hybrid NCs aside from the Au@AZTS samples shown here, as long as the intended guest cations have proper softness to achieve positive free energy during the cation exchange process.

(d–f) TEM images of the spherical Au@AZTS core–shell NCs with core size maintained at 38 nm and shell thicknesses precisely modulated at (d) 7.2 ± 0.8, (e) 9.1 ± 1.0, and (f) 10.2 ± 2.6 nm respectively, and (h) the corresponding normalized extinction spectra. The black lines in (g) and (h) correspond to the sample shown in Fig. 1(b).	 

 	Fig. 4  (a) TEM image and (b and c) HRTEM images of the Au@AZTS core–shell NRs. (d) HAADF-STEM image and (e–i) EDX elemental maps of Au, Ag, Zn, Sn, and S, respectively, for the Au@AZTS core–shell NRs. (j) Normalized extinction spectrum of Au@AZTS core–shell NRs in comparison with that of the starting Au colloids with a rod-like morphology. The spectra are normalized with respect to the corresponding longitudinal plasmon band maximum.	 

 	Fig. 5  (a) Linear sweep voltammetry curves and (b) chronoamperometric I–t curves (at an applied potential of 0 V vs. Ag/AgCl) of the spherical Au@AZTS core–shell photoanodes with varied core sizes and shell thicknesses in an aqueous solution of 0.5 M Na2S and 0.5 M Na2SO3 under chopped light illumination (λ > 420 nm). (c) The time course of H2 evolution for the spherical Au@AZTS core–shell photoanode (core size of 38.0 ± 1.3 nm and shell thickness of 9.1 ± 1.0 nm) under a bias of 0 V vs. Ag/AgCl. The dashed line (e−/2) is the expected amount of hydrogen evolved calculated from the measured photocurrent (the amount of electrons passing through the external circuit) assuming 100% faradaic efficiency. (d) IPCE spectrum (blue) and extinction spectrum (red) of the spherical Au@AZTS core–shell photoanode (core size of 38.0 ± 1.3 nm and shell thickness of 9.1 ± 1.0 nm).
