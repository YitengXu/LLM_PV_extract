    , Accepted 1st May 2018First published on 1st May 2018AbstractHybrid systems have great potential for a wide range of applications in chemistry, physics and materials science. Conjugation of a biosystem to a molecular material can tune the properties of the components or give rise to new properties. As a workhorse, here we take a C60@lysozyme hybrid. We show that lysozyme recognizes and disperses fullerene in water. AFM, cryo-TEM and high resolution X-ray powder diffraction show that the C60 dispersion is monomolecular. The adduct is biocompatible, stable in physiological and technologically-relevant environments, and easy to store. Hybridization with lysozyme preserves the electrochemical properties of C60. EPR spin-trapping experiments show that the C60@lysozyme hybrid produces ROS following both type I and type II mechanisms. Due to the shielding effect of proteins, the adduct generates significant amounts of 1O2 also in aqueous solution. In the case of type I mechanism, the protein residues provide electrons and the hybrid does not require addition of external electron donors. The preparation process and the properties of C60@lysozyme are general and can be expected to be similar to other C60@protein systems. It is envisaged that the properties of the C60@protein hybrids will pave the way for a host of applications in nanomedicine, nanotechnology, and photocatalysis.
Introduction
C60 retains a privileged status in the carbon family and continues to stimulate the development of new platforms for producing advanced materials. Versatile technological applications of fullerenes have been proposed and are in continuous development in different fields that cover lubricants, superconductors, sensors, solar cells, pharmaceutical scaffolds, contrast agents and therapeutic agents in cancer therapy, and, in general, new applications for nanotechnology1–11 and nanomedicine.4,12–17
The insolubility of fullerenes in a physiological environment and the formation of fullerene aggregates, also in organic solvents, hampers its exploitation.18 The photophysical and photochemical properties of C60 depend strictly on the nature of the fullerene dispersion and a strict control of the dispersion is truly necessary for technological applications.19,20
Different approaches have been used to increase the dispersion of fullerenes, each with its own drawbacks:
(i) Mechanical dispersion-stabilization of C60,21 either through ultrasonication22 or by solvent-exchange methods.23 These mechano-physical approaches generate only metastable dispersions of fullerenes, that eventually re-aggregate. These harsh treatments may determine uncontrolled modifications of the chemical surface of C60.24
(ii) Synthesis of water-soluble fullerene derivatives by chemical functionalization with the hydrophilic groups of pristine fullerene.4,25,26 The chemical functionalization of the fullerene shows limitations due to the fact that soft derivatization processes maintain the tendency of these amphiphilic C60 derivatives to aggregate,27 while multiple functionalizations lead to the alterations of the unique structure of the fullerene and has a negative influence on its peculiar properties, thus, restricting potential for applications.
(iii) Use of dispersants such as surfactants, block copolymers, amphiphilic polymers, micelles and liposomes.28,29 The use of dispersants is effective and a large quantity of C60 can also be dispersed in water. The resulting solutions are characterized by polydispersion of fullerene aggregates of different sizes, because the fullerenes may exist in the form of both small aggregates solubilized within the hydrophobic core of the nanostructures formed by the dispersants and large aggregates stabilized by the surface adsorption of the dispersants.28,29
(iv) Dispersion of C60 using suitable carriers endowed with hydrophobic cores, such as γ-cyclodextrins, calixarenes, and other macrocyclic receptors or molecular tweezers.30–32 The supramolecular approach is the most effective way to obtain monodispersed pristine fullerenes. Subsequent aggregation of the inclusion complexes33 is common and for some biological applications, the fullerene host may be toxic.
Many proteins are known to interact with fullerenes.34–66 Studies that aim to exploit the protein–C60 recognition process for technological applications are few. When proteins were used to disperse fullerenes in water, they were simply used in lieu of surfactant molecules,67,68 leading to fullerene aggregates of various sizes.67,68 We recently proposed an innovative approach, using a protein namely lysozyme, to disperse C60 with a 1:1 stoichiometry.36,44 The recognition is well-defined and the fullerene binds selectively in the protein substrate binding pocket.36,44 Lysozyme, similar to many proteins, follows, as a supramolecular host, the set of rules defined by Martin and Perez69,70 to recognize efficiently carbon nanomaterials36,71 which entail: (i) the presence of a nonpolar cavity, featuring aromatic recognizing units (Trp residues) of the appropriate size to fit the fullerene cage; (ii) a recognition process based on concave–convex complementarity; and (iii) a high degree of pre-organization of the host (due to the 3D structure of the protein) that lowers the entropic cost for guest binding.
Results and discussion
C60@lysozyme hybrids were prepared in an Eppendorf tube by adding C60 powder in a solution of lysozyme. The Eppendorf tube was ultrasonicated and after centrifugation and collection of the supernatant, a brown solution was obtained. The UV-vis spectrum of the solution (Fig. 1) clearly demonstrates the presence of the fullerene in water; in particular, note the diagnostic band at 341 nm. This dispersion system is more efficient than the commonly used γ-cyclodextrin, that represents the most popular way to disperse C60 in water (Fig. 1). The absorbance at 341 nm for C60@lysozyme (0.515) is 1.76 higher than C60 dispersed with γ-cyclodextrin (0.293).

AFM imaging of C60@lysozyme hybrids
NMR experiments have already shown the formation of a 1:1 stoichiometric adduct of lysozyme and the fullerene.36 A direct measure of the dispersion of the C60@lysozyme hybrid is provided by atomic force microscopy (AFM). In Fig. 2a, the C60@lysozyme hybrids appear to be monomolecularly dispersed over a mica surface. Height distribution analysis (Fig. 2b) of the AFM images is consistent with that of a singly adsorbed C60@lysozyme monodispersed and confirms the lack of presence of C60@lysozyme aggregates, or nC60 aggregates dispersed by the protein.
 Fig. 2  (a) AFM image of C60@lysozyme, top view (500 nm × 500 nm); scale bar: 100 nm. (b) Height distribution analysis of the AFM images. 
To eliminate the possible surface effects due to the adsorption of proteins on a surface, cryo-TEM experiments were carried out on the C60@lysozyme solution. Cryo-TEM images allowed direct visualization of the dispersion state in solution of the C60@lysozyme hybrids (Fig. 3a).72 The particle size distribution (Fig. 3b) shows that the C60@lysozyme are monodispersed and there is no presence of nC60 aggregates. These aggregates were previously observed when proteins or other surfactants were used as dispersants. They showed faceted, high-contrast particles, characteristic of crystalline aggregates.68,69,73

Furthermore, when fullerene aggregates (nC60) are present in solution, X-ray diffraction patterns show peaks that evidence the presence of crystalline aggregates of the fullerene.74,75 The high resolution X-ray powder diffraction pattern of a freeze-dried C60@lysozyme solution does not show any diffraction peak (Fig. 3c).
These data confirm the absence of C60 crystalline aggregates in solution, the ability of lysozyme to disperse monomolecular C60 and more importantly provide a route for the storage of monodispersed fullerenes by lyophilization. In fact, re-dissolution of the lyophilized powder gives back a solution with the same characteristic as the starting C60@lysozyme solution.
Stability of C60@lysozyme hybrids
The analysis of the stability of C60@lysozyme at different pH values shows that the solution is stable up to the isoelectric point of lysozyme (pH 10.7), where aggregation occurs (Fig. 4a).
 Fig. 4  C60@lysozyme: (a) absorbance vs. pH and (b) zeta potential at different NaCl concentrations. 
The C60@lysozyme adduct is stable also at different saline concentrations, up to the physiological concentration (Fig. 4b), while usually C60 dispersed with γ-cyclodextrins or nC60 rapidly precipitates when NaCl is added.23 This means that the C60 solubility is governed entirely by the protein. The solutions of C60@lysozyme remain stable for months in water. The formation of monodispersions and stability of C60@lysozyme, in water and in saline solutions, opens the way for technological applications able to exploit the chemical–physical properties of C60 in physiologically and technologically relevant environments.
Electrochemical characterization of C60@lysozyme hybrids
In Fig. 5a, the cyclic voltammetry curves recorded for the C60@lysozyme hybrids and for lysozyme are shown.
 Fig. 5  (a) Cyclic voltammograms of C60@lysozyme hybrids (solid line) and pristine lysozyme (dashed line); scan rate: 5 mV s−1. (b) C60@lysozyme reduction peak baselines subtracted; scan rates: 5 mV s−1 (gray line) and 20 mV s−1 (blue line). A glassy carbon electrode was used as the working electrode in 10 mM NaCl aqueous solution; the potentials are reported towards the SCE reference electrode. 
C60@lysozyme shows a reduction peak at −0.49 V vs. SCE and an oxidation peak at −0.24 V vs. SCE. No peaks were observed in the same potential window for the pristine lysozyme. The peak–peak separation is 250 mV which is in accordance with a slow charge transfer probably due to the hindrance of the C60 charge transfer to the electrode caused by the protein. In Fig. 5b, the reduction peaks of C60@lysozyme, subtracted for the baseline recorded at 5 and 20 mV s−1, are shown. The potential of the reduction peak is around −0.5 V vs. SCE. This potential is more negative than the one recorded for C60 in an organic solvent, a behavior that is due to the partial charge transfer of the amino acids constituting the binding site to the C60 moiety. We already showed that two tryptophan residues strongly interact with the C60 cage in the binding site36 and that they establish a charge transfer process toward C60.36
C60 presents six possible reduction waves; anyway they are only rarely observed in ultra-dry solvents, and typically 2–3 quasi-reversible reduction waves are observed in organic solvents. Here, we report for the first time the electrochemical behaviour of a C60@protein complex monodispersed in water, which retains the first reduction wave of C60. This process appears to be irreversible under the investigated conditions. The voltammetric study confirms that the first reduction of C60 is observable even when the carbon cage is confined in the protein binding pocket. In turn, modification of the pocket may tune the C60 redox potential. Since fullerenes are ideal electron mediators, C60@protein hybrids can lead to new applications of C60 in electrochemical catalytic systems or in biosensing.10–12
Photoinduced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation by C60@lysozyme hybrids
C60 shows a significant visible light-induced generation of ROS, that can be exploited in photodynamic therapy76–87 or photocatalysis.88–91 However, the use of C60 molecules in water still presents important restrictions in its application due to both the dependency of C60 properties on the physiological environment and the related aggregation phenomena92 and the poor solubility of C60.18 Aggregation is a well-known factor that deactivates the electronically excited states of photosensitizers, drastically decreasing the lifetime of the long-lived triplet excited state, and consequently reducing the ROS production efficiency.19,20,92,93 When fullerene aggregates are present,  is rapidly quenched by the surrounding C60 or by other .20 In addition, aggregation reduces the active surface area of C60 in contact with oxygen molecules for ROS production. The possibility of using C60@lysozyme may overcome the current limitations.
Two different pathways can be identified for the production of ROS upon light absorption by C60. In the simpler pathway (also known as type II energy transfer), the singlet excited state of C60, initially formed, is converted to the long lived triplet state through the intersystem crossing with a quantum yield close to unity. 3C60 can be efficiently quenched by molecular oxygen (3O2) to generate large amounts of singlet oxygen (1O2). In the more complex pathway (also known as type I electron transfer), 3C60, in the presence of electron donors, gives the C60 radical anion that can readily transfer the electron to molecular oxygen forming the superoxide anion radical (O2˙−) or the hydroxyl radical (˙OH). EPR measurements with the use of a spin trap can be used to verify the presence of the two pathways.

1O2 production was detected by EPR using 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-4-piperidone (4-oxo-TEMP) as a probe. Actually, 4-oxo-TEMP reacts with 1O2 to afford the 4-oxo-TEMPO nitroxide radical (see Fig. 6a) that can be detected by EPR. The measurements were carried out by irradiating the aqueous solution containing lysozyme, C60@lysozyme, and C60@2γ-cyclodextrin with visible light. All solutions were prepared at the same fullerene concentration (identified by the same intensity of absorption at 341 nm). When lysozyme and C60@2γ-cyclodextrin were irradiated up to 15 minutes in the presence of 4-oxo-TEMP, no significant increase in the signal due to 4-oxo-TEMPO was detected by EPR. In contrast, the specific signals of 4-oxo-TEMPO significantly increase when C60@lysozyme is photoirradiated for 15 min (see Fig. 6b). This result suggests that a significant amount of 1O2 is generated in the aqueous solution during the irradiation of C60@lysozyme and that the protein environment strongly reduces the quenching of singlet oxygen by water molecules.

The pathway for ROS generation was also investigated by EPR with 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO) as a spin-trapping reagent. The generation of ˙OH was detected through an EPR signal corresponding to DMPO-OH, formed by the reaction of ˙OH with DMPO (Fig. 7a).
 Fig. 7  (a) Reaction scheme for the generation of DMPO-OH by the reaction of ˙OH with DMPO; (b) X-band EPR spectra of DMPO-OH formed in aqueous solution of the C60@lysozyme complex at different irradiation times; and (c) X-band EPR spectra of DMPO-OH at time 0 and after 15 minutes of photoirradiation for C60@2γ-cyclodextrin, lysozyme and C60@lysozyme. 

Fig. 7b clearly shows the specific signals of DMPO-OH (aN = aH = 14.75 G), which was produced upon irradiation by the reaction of DMPO with the radical oxygen species generated by C60@lysozyme. During the initial minutes of irradiation, the spectrum also shows the presence of an alkyl adduct in DMPO (aN = 15.80 G, aH = 22.52 G). The extension of irradiation, however, leads to a significant decrease in the intensity of this signal.
With C60@2γ-cyclodextrin or lysozyme, the amount of radical oxygen species generated by irradiation of the aqueous solution was significantly smaller, as indicated by the very weak EPR signal recorded under these conditions (Fig. 7c).
Importantly, in the case of the type I mechanism, measurements involving C60 need the addition of a sacrificial electron donor, for example, NADH or triethylamine. The C60@lysozyme hybrid, however, does not need any external electron donors because the protein residues do this work. This means that the type I mechanism is self-activated in the C60@lysozyme hybrid, due to the presence of the protein itself.
The high performances of C60@lysozyme in the visible light-induced generation of ROS in water suggest the potential use of this hybrid as an agent for photodynamic therapy.76–87 Photogenerated singlet oxygen can also be used in synthetic organic chemistry. Even though singlet oxygen is a short-lived metastable excited state of molecular oxygen, it is a practical reagent for compound oxidation and can form carbon–oxygen and heteroatom–oxygen bonds.88–91
Conclusion
In this paper, we demonstrated that lysozyme can be used as a host molecule to recognize and disperse fullerenes in water. AFM, cryo-TEM and high resolution X-ray powder diffraction analyses showed that the C60 dispersion is monomolecular. The adduct is biocompatible, stable in physiologically and technologically relevant environments, and easy to store. The electrochemical properties of C60 are preserved in the C60@protein hybrids suggesting new applications in electrochemical catalytic systems, biosensing or bioelectronics. EPR spin-trapping experiments showed that the C60@lysozyme hybrid is able to produce a considerable amount of ROS following both the type I and type II mechanisms. This behavior suggests potential application of C60@proteins in photodynamic therapy or in organic synthesis as singlet oxygen generators. Considering the use of C60 in nanomedicine, C60@protein hybrids may also be potentially used for sonodynamic therapy, enhanced microwave- and radiowave-induced hyperthermia, photothermal treatment and optoacoustic imaging.
In addition, the different chemical groups offered by the protein platform allow an easy route for the functionalization of the hybrid, without altering the structure and properties of the fullerene. The C60@protein hybrids could be augmented by using (1) targeting tags able to improve the cell/bacterial selectivity and promote the uptake of the C60@protein hybrid in cancer or antimicrobial therapy; (2) imaging tags to create an innovative, protein based theranostic platform; and (3) light-harvesting antennae to extend the absorption spectrum of the C60@protein hybrid further into the red. Furthermore, these hybrids could be used to create stable and ordered C60 suprastructures on surfaces with potential applications in nanotechnology, ranging from sensors and photovoltaic cells to nanostructured devices for advanced electronic applications.
Proteins, other than lysozyme, can be exploited in the future to tune the C60 properties94 and to shape a variety of C60 spatial arrangements on surfaces, controlling the C60 molecular assembly. C60 is not yet exhausted in its role as a leading material, because its integration in biomolecules will pave the way to new innovative applications.
Materials and methods
Synthesis of C60@lysozyme and C60@2γ-cyclodextrin hybrids
The adducts of C60@2γ-cyclodextrin and C60@lysozyme were synthesized as described previously.36 C60 powder (Sigma-Aldrich, cat. no. 483036) was used in a 2:1 excess with respect to the stoichiometric relationship to 1 mL of a 1 mM solution of lysozyme (lysozyme from chicken egg white lyophilized powder, cat. no. L6876) or γ-cyclodextrin (Sigma-Aldrich, cat. no. C4892) in Milli-Q water. After sonication for 60 min using a probe tip sonicator (Hielscher Ultrasonic Processor UP200St, equipped with a sonotrode S26d7, used at 45% of the maximum amplitude) in an ice bath, C60 was dispersed in the solution forming a dark brown mixture. A dark-brown solution was obtained after centrifugation at 10600g for 10 min and the supernatant was collected. In order to eliminate possible ROS generated during the sonication process, the solution was washed four times with 3 K Amicon Ultra-0.5 Centrifugal Filter Units, using a volume of 500 μL and spinning at 14000g for 20 minutes, obtaining a concentration factor of 8. After each spin, the volume of the concentrated solution was brought to its original value using Milli-Q water. UV-vis absorption spectra were recorded at 25 °C by means of an Agilent Cary 60 UV-Vis spectrophotometer. Zeta potential measurements were carried out using a Malvern Zetasizer Nano ZS.

AFM measurements. 
AFM experiments were performed at the SPM@ISMN microscopy facility in Bologna. An AFM (Digital Instruments, Multimode VIII equipped with a Nanoscope V) operated in the ScanAsyst mode was used to analyze the dispersion state of the proteins. The samples for AFM measurements were prepared by drop-casting 5 μl of C60@lysozyme hybrid solutions onto a freshly cleaved mica substrate for 10 min, and then rinsed with Milli-Q water and dried with a stream of N2. Height distribution from AFM images was calculated using Gwyddion.


Cryo-TEM microscopy. 
Sample vitrification was performed using an automated vitrification robot (FEI Vitrobot™ Mark III) for plunging in liquid ethane. TEM Cu Quantifoil grids, R2/2 (Quantifoil Micro Tools GmbH) were surface plasma cleaned for 40 s using a Cressington 208 carbon coater prior to use. The samples were studied on the TU/e Cryo Titan (FEI, http://www.cryotem.nl), equipped with a field emission gun (FEG) operating at 300 kV and a post-column Gatan energy filter (GIF). Images were recorded using a post-GIF 2k × 2k Gatan CCD camera under low dose conditions. Particle diameters were measured with the Measure_lengths script from the CMEM toolbox. As spherical symmetry was assumed, the diameter was averaged over the ‘length’ and the ‘width’. For each image, 6 regions were selected, in which approx. 33 particles were measured. Data were analyzed with Origin. The data were binned in bins with sizes set equal to the pixel size (0.2814 nm).


X-ray powder diffraction measurements. 
High resolution X-ray powder diffraction (HRPXRD) measurements were carried out with a dedicated high-resolution powder diffraction synchrotron beamline (ID22 at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF), Grenoble, France) at the wavelength of 0.039 nm. The C60@protein water dispersions were lyophilized before the HRPXRD measurements.

Electrochemical characterization of C60@lysozyme hybrids

Instrumentation. 
The electrochemical measurements were performed using a CHI900B bipotentiostat (from CH Instruments Inc., Austin, TX) in a typical three-electrode configuration cell. A glassy carbon electrode (∅ = 1 mm) was used as the working electrode (WE), a platinum wire as the counter electrode (CE) and a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as the reference electrode (RE). The working electrode was carefully polished mechanically before use, employing 0.05 mm alumina paste and successively cleaned ultrasonically in distilled water for 5 min.


Measurement. 
The solution (PBS 1×) was degassed by bubbling Ar for at least 30 min before measuring and cyclic voltammetry was carried out between the potential range from 0.0 to −0.8 V at different scan rates: 5 mV s−1, 10 mV s−1, 20 mV s−1, 50 mV s−1, and 100 mV s−1.


EPR spectroscopy. 
EPR spectra were recorded at 298 K using an ELEXYS E500 spectrometer equipped with an NMR gaussmeter for the calibration of the magnetic field and a frequency counter for the determination of g-factors that were corrected against those of the perylene radical cation in concentrated sulfuric acid (g = 2.002583). Light irradiation and EPR measurements were carried out on the sample in capillary tubes (1 mm i.d.). Measurement conditions: modulation amplitude = 1.0 G; conversion time = 163.84 ms; time constant = 163.84 ms; modulation frequency = 100 kHz; microwave power = 6.4 mW; and microwave frequency = 9.375 GHz.



1O2 generation by the EPR spin-trapping method. 

1O2 was detected by EPR using 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-4-piperidone (4-oxo-TEMP, Sigma-Aldrich, cat. no. 459119) as a probe. To 0.1 mM C60@lysozyme (40 μL) in Milli-Q water, 0.5 M 4-oxo-TEMP (20 μL) and Milli-Q water (140 μL) were added and mixed well. The mixed solution was introduced into a capillary tube, deaerated under nitrogen flux, sealed and placed inside an EPR tube. The sample was irradiated by using a UV-filtered 500 W high pressure mercury lamp and subjected to EPR measurements. The generation of singlet oxygen was detected by the three line EPR signal (aN = 16.13 G) corresponding to 4-oxo-TEMPO, formed by the reaction of 1O2 with 4-oxo-TEMP.


˙OH generation by the EPR spin-trapping method. 
˙OH was detected by EPR using 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO, Sigma-Aldrich, cat. no. 92688) as a spin-trapping reagent. To a 0.1 mM C60@lysozyme (40 μL) in Milli-Q water (20 μL), 0.1 mM DMPO (2 μL) and Milli Q water (180 μL) were added and mixed well. The mixed solution was introduced into a capillary tube, deaerated under nitrogen flux, sealed and placed inside an EPR tube. The sample was irradiated by using a UV-filtered 500 W high pressure mercury lamp and subjected to EPR measurements. The generation of ˙OH was detected by the five line signal corresponding to DMPO-OH, formed by the reaction of ˙OH with DMPO (aN = aH = 14.75 G).
