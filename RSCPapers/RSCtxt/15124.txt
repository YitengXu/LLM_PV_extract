PBTZF4:bPDI2P solar cells exhibit a high open circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.118 V, a short circuit current density (Jsc) of 10.02 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 49.5%, affording a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 5.55%. Interestingly, a lower PCE of 3.68% is obtained with the difluorinated analogue, poly[(4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)-thiophene-2-yl)-benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene)-alt-(5,6-difluoro-4,7-(4-(2-ethyl-hexyl)-dithien-2-yl-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole)] (PBTZF2). Both PBTZF4:bPDI2P and PBTZF2:bPDI2P cells benefit from complementary (donor/acceptor) light absorption and very low geminate recombination, with bimolecular recombination being the dominant loss mechanism, as established by femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy. DFT computation and physicochemical characterization data argue that the “additional” tetrafluorination planarizes the PBTZF4 backbone and enhances aggregation versusPBTZF2, affording superior charge carrier transport as assayed by field-effect mobility. In addition, fluorine-originated HOMO stabilization, −5.41 eV for PBTZF4versus −5.33 eV for PBTZF2, and a superior blend microstructure afford a higher PBTZF4:bPDI2P solar cell PCE versusPBTZF2:bPDI2P.
Introduction
Organic photovoltaic (OPV) cell technology has the potential to provide a clean and affordable source of renewable energy.1–5 The photoactive layer of high-performance OPV devices is typically composed of a nanoscopic phase-segregated blend of a p-type semiconducting (donor) and an n-type semiconducting (acceptor) material, which define a bulk heterojunction (BHJ) structure. Power conversion efficiencies (PCE), defined as the ratio of the output electric power to the incident solar power, approaching 12% have recently been attained using this device structure.6,7 Fullerene derivatives have traditionally been employed as the versatile n-type component in high-performing solar cells and their roles have been well characterized.7–11 While fullerenes display desirable transport properties and enable impressive charge separation efficiency in BHJs, they are limited in broad applicability because of their spectrally narrow light absorption, high cost, and poor air stability.12 Much effort has thus been devoted to fabricating solar cells with alternative molecular or polymeric electron acceptors.12–21 Among the former, small molecules and oligomers based on the perylenediimide (PDI) core have afforded encouraging results.15–19,22–31
Introducing fluorine into the (hetero)aromatic units of organic semiconductors, or their hydrocarbon pendants, affords a number of attractions in comparison to the non-fluorinated analogues.32–35 Typical physicochemical effects of fluorination include shifts of the oxidation/reduction potentials to more negative values, increased air stability, increased backbone planarity, denser packing and enhanced self-assembly via C–F⋯H, S⋯F, and π⋯F non-covalent interactions.32–39 Compared to the herringbone stacking of most non-fluorinated acenes and (hetero)arenes, fluorinated conjugated molecules tend to crystallize in co-facial and/or slipped-stack motifs, which are more conducive to charge transport.33,40 Besides enhancing crystallinity and the bulk charge transport properties of the pristine semiconductor, fluorination of one of the BHJ blend components has been shown to benefit the entire blend.34,36,41 Fluorinated polymers also favour “π-face-on” crystalline domain orientation on the electrode – particularly important for efficient OPV operation.36,41 Therefore, fluorinated donor polymers are frequently used in high-performance BHJ solar cells.7,36,41–50 Interestingly, variable fluorination can have a dramatic effect on several other properties of organic semiconductors, including dipole moment and optical absorption spectra.38,46,51–55 For all these reasons, fluorination of organic semiconductors is an active research area.34 Importantly, in contrast to mono- and difluorinated (per repeat unit) derivatives, semiconducting polymers with higher fluorine content (>3 fluorine atoms per repeat unit), despite exhibiting promising OPV performance,17,56 have been significantly less investigated.
The electron-rich building block 4,8-bis(thiophene-2-yl)-benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDTT) has been employed in polymers that have performed well when paired with both fullerene and non-fullerene acceptors.27,28,57–60 Similarly, polymers based on the electron-deficient subunit 4,7-dithien-2-yl-2,1,3-benzothia-diazole (BTDT) have also yielded high performance, in both fullerene-containing and fullerene-free solar cells.7,47,48,58 Here, we wish to report a new tetrafluorinated (per repeat unit) semiconducting polymer, PBTZF4 (Fig. 1). PBTZF4 was designed and developed as a high fluorine density derivative of the BDTT–BTDT based materials mentioned above. Furthermore, for consistency and systematic comparisons, the difluorinated polymer, PBTZF2,61,62 was also synthesized.63–67 Charge transport properties are investigated by fabricating organic field-effect transistors (OFETs). The fullerene-free solar cell performance of these polymers is investigated by pairing them with the phenanthrene-linked PDI dimer [1,2:3,4]-bis-[N,N′-bis-1-pentylhexyl-perylenediimide-1,12-yl]-benzene (bPDI2P, Fig. 1).68 Attention is devoted to elucidating how added fluorination affects polymer backbone planarity, blend morphology, and microstructure, in addition to its effect on the device metrics in non-fullerene solar cells. Finally, the photo-physical properties of the BHJ blends are characterized to better understand exciton dynamics and OPV performance.

Results
Synthesis and polymer thermal characterization
Polymers PBTZF2 and PBTZF4 were synthesized via a modified Stille coupling protocol, the details of which are given in the ESI.† Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) experiments reveal number average molecular weights (Mn) of 17.2 and 17.0 kDa for PBTZF2 and PBTZF4, respectively, with similar polydispersity indices (PDI) of 1.59 and 1.79 for PBTZF2 and PBTZF4, respectively (Table 1). The thermal properties of the polymers were next characterized by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). PBTZF4 exhibits slightly greater thermal stability than PBTZF2, with TGA-derived decomposition temperatures (Td) of 435 and 425 °C, respectively (Table 1, Fig. S3†). Neither polymer exhibits notable features in the DSC scans (Fig. S4†).

Molecular orbital computation
The electronic structures of the present polymers were analyzed at the DFT/B3LYP/6-31G** level on model structures comprised of two polymer repeat units (Fig. S5a†). Geometry-optimized structures (side and top views) of the repeat unit are also reproduced in Fig. 1. DFT analysis reveals that the two polymers have similar backbone geometries and orbital topologies. Both model molecules have moderately twisted backbones, with the central plane of the BDTT subunit twisted from coplanarity with the BTDT subunit by 14°, and both have their thienyl groups twisted from coplanarity with BDTT subunit by ∼55° (C–C–C–C dihedral angles as shown in Fig. 1). In both polymers, the LUMO is localized on the BTDT subunit and the HOMO is delocalized throughout the backbone (Fig. S5b†).61 However, added fluorination in PBTZF4 lowers its FMOs substantially. The DFT estimated HOMO level of PBTZF4 (−4.92 eV) is lower than that of PBTZF2 (−4.76 eV) by 0.16 eV and the LUMO is lower by 0.11 eV, −2.91 and −2.80 eV for PBTZF4 and PBTZF2, respectively. Thus, the computed band gap of the former is greater by 0.06 eV.
Optical and electrochemical properties
The solution (chlorobenzene, CB, Fig. 2a) and film (spun-cast from CB, Fig. 2b) absorption spectra of both polymers show a strong absorption band from ∼500 nm to ∼700 nm, which corresponds to an intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) transition, and a weaker band from ∼400 nm to ∼480 nm, which corresponds to a π–π* transition.61,62,69 The ICT bands of both polymers also show, both in solution and in film, a low-energy shoulder at ∼610 nm to ∼640 nm.61,62,69 These shoulders gradually disappear when the solution absorption spectra are measured at increasing temperatures, reasonably suggesting that polymer aggregates are responsible for such features (Fig. S7†).70 Both in solution and in the solid state, PBTZF4 shows a stronger shoulder than PBTZF2. When normalized to the maxima (λmax), the aggregation shoulder attains a peak absorption of 0.95 in PBTZF4 films versus only 0.79 in PBTZF2, and similar trends are found in solution as well (Fig. 2a and b).

(c) Spectra of the polymer:bPDI2P blend films. (d) Energy levels of the materials used to fabricate solar cells in this contribution. (e) OFET transfer plots of the polymers. 
The solution/film λmax of PBTZF4 (582/593 nm) are red-shifted compared to those of PBTZF2 (569/586 nm) and while the absorption onsets (λonset) for the two solutions are similar, the film λonset is slightly redshifted in PBTZF4 (704 nm) versus that of PBTZF2 (701 nm) (Table 1). Interestingly, the differences between the two pristine polymer films are retained in the polymer:bPDI2P blend films (Fig. 2c). Due to a stronger aggregation shoulder and redshifted absorbance, PBTZF4:bPDI2P overall absorbs more light than PBTZF2:bPDI2P. While PBTZF4:bPDI2P films absorb light uniformly from 500 nm to 640 nm, absorbance of PBTZF2:bPDI2P begins to decline by 570 nm. The absorption spectra of the pristine polymer films show a large valley at wavelengths shorter than λmax, however the polymer:bPDI2P blends absorb over most of the visible spectrum due to complementary absorption by bPDI2P. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the pristine polymer films and polymer:bPDI2P blend films, with varying bPDI2P content, were measured to study photoluminescence quenching efficiency (ΔPL). Interestingly, at 1:1 polymer:bPDI2P ratio, the photoluminescence of both polymers is quenched by >90% in the blends, which indicates that both polymers form intermixed blends with bPDI2P where exciton diffusion to D/A interface and subsequent charge transfer is efficient. (Fig. S8†).58
The redox properties of PBTZF2 and PBTZF4 were characterized by cyclic voltammetry (CV) in the film state (Fig. S4†). Both polymers exhibit prominent quasi-reversible oxidation peaks, the onset potentials of which are used to estimate the HOMO energies (EHOMO = − (Eonsetox + 4.88)).71 Since neither polymer undergoes detectable reduction, the LUMO energy levels were estimated using the accepted approximation, EHOMO and Eoptg (ELUMO = EHOMO + Eoptg).72 Consistent with the DFT calculation, both EHOMO and ELUMO of PBTZF4 lie lower than the respective values for PBTZF2 (Table 1). Note that the polymer energy levels and those of bPDI2P68 are in good relative positions to employ polymer:bPDI2P blends as BHJ active layers in OPV devices (Fig. 2d).73,74
Charge transport in organic transistors
Bottom-gate top-contact (BGTC) OFETs were fabricated and evaluated in the saturation regime to characterize the in-plane charge transport. The polymer solutions (∼5 mg mL−1 in CB) were spin-coated onto pre-cleaned Si/SiO2 substrates and annealed for 10 min prior to the vacuum deposition of the gold electrodes through shadow masks (device area: 50 μm × 1000 μm, see ESI† for details). Representative transfer plots and a summary of electronic characterization are provided in Fig. 2e and Table 2 correspondingly.

The hole mobility of unannealed PBTZF4 devices (7.72 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) is ∼50 times greater than that of unannealed PBTZF2 devices (1.68 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1) and the current on/off ratios of the former are greater by ∼100 times, with log(ION/IOFF) = 5.25 and 3.14 for PBTZF4 and PBTZF2, respectively. For films annealed at 200 °C, the difference in mobility between PBTZF4 (3.33 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1) and PBTZF2 (2.24 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1) increases to ∼150 times. Thus, the charge transport capacity of PBTZF4 films is significantly greater than that of PBTZF2, independent of thermal history.
Solar cell fabrication and characterization

PBTZF2 and PBTZF4 were blended with bPDI2P in CB in a 1:1 weight ratio and spun-cast as active layers to fabricate inverted organic solar cells of structure ITO/ZnOx/BHJ blend/MoOx/Ag (details in ESI†). Thermal annealing of the blend does not improve the OPV performance (Table S2†), but, the active layer thickness is found to be important (Table 3). The highest performances for both blends are obtained for ∼85 nm thick active layers, with thicker layers having lower fill factors (FF) and thinner layers showing lower short circuit current densities (Jsc). Both polymers afford cells with high (>0.99 V) open circuit voltages (Voc). With a Voc of 0.993 V, Jsc of 9.21 mA cm−2 and FF = 40.0%, a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 3.68% is obtained for PBTZF2:bPDI2P devices. The PCE obtained for PBTZF4:bPDI2P (5.55%) is higher because of the higher Voc (1.118 V), Jsc (10.02 mA cm−2), and FF (49.5%).

Current density–voltage (J–V) and external quantum efficiency–wavelength (EQE–λ) plots for the best-performing cells of the PBTZF2:bPDI2P and PBTZF4:bPDI2P blends are shown in Fig. 3a and b. The EQE–λ curves show that both blends harvest photons across similar regions of the solar spectrum. The peak EQE for both blends occurs at 450 nm (62 and 60% for PBTZF2:bPDI2P and PBTZF4:bPDI2P, respectively) and decreases, for both, at longer wavelengths, but more rapidly in the case of the former blend. At 650 nm, the EQE is only 40% for PBTZF2:bPDI2P but 53% for PBTZF4:bPDI2P. The difference between the absorption spectra of the two blends, described in preceding sections, correlates with the EQE differences between the PBTZF2:bPDI2P and PBTZF4:bPDI2P devices and largely accounts for the different Jsc values of the two cells (Table 3, Fig. 3).

Charge separation and recombination
The charge separation and recombination dynamics of the PBTZF4:bPDI2P and PBTZF2:bPDI2P blends were next probed via femtosecond transient absorption (fsTA) spectroscopy. The fsTA spectra obtained for the pristine polymer and blend films are shown in Fig. S7.† The polymer ground state bleach signals (500–700 nm) were identified from the pristine films and were used to obtain kinetic profiles of the transient excited species (excitons) (Fig. S8a†). The blend films show growth of a feature between 700–800 nm that does not exist in the neat films. This photoinduced absorption peaks at ∼700 nm, is long-lived, with a lifetime longer than the timescale of the experiment, and is consistent with spectra that have previously been assigned to absorption by fully charge-separated states involving the bPDI2P radical anion.68 The growth in intensity of this feature can thus be assigned to the formation of fully charge-separated species in the present study as well.
On the basis of these data, a model for charge separation and recombination processes in the PBTZF4:bPDI2P and PBTZF2:bPDI2P blends can be proposed (Fig. 4a). Upon photoexcitation from the ground state (S0) to the exciton state (S1), charge separation of S1 into charge separated (CS) states occurs through a combination of ultrafast and diffusion-limited processes; and finally, the resultant CS states, bPDI2P radical anion and the polymer radical cation, recombine bimolecularly.75,76 Global fitting of the fsTA data at the different wavelengths, as shown in Fig. S9,† to this model is used to generate the species-associated spectra for the S1 and CS states (Fig. 4b) and the kinetic profile of the CS states (Fig. 4c).77 The kinetic profile of the CS states at early times (<100 ps) reveals that a fraction of the CS species are generated via an ultrafast process, within the instrumental response time, or ∼250 fs, and the rest are generated gradually. The time constants for the later process are similar for the two blends, 31 and 35 ps for PBTZF2:bPDI2P and PBTZF4:bPDI2P, respectively, and can be assigned to diffusion-limited charge separation.76 The only species, which contributes to the transient feature at 700 nm is the bPDI2P anion, thus the ratio between the ultrafast and diffusion-limited charge separation process is confirmed by monitoring the kinetics at 700 nm. Note that the relative proportion of charge carriers generated through the ultrafast mechanism is significantly greater in PBTZF2:bPDI2P (∼80%) than in PBTZF4:bPDI2P (∼30%). At later time scales (>100 ps, Fig. 4c), the CS state absorption decays bimolecularly, with a half-life greater than 10 ns and can be assigned to bimolecular recombination.

(b) Species associated difference spectra of exciton (S1) and charge separated (CS) states. (c) Kinetic profile of the CS state of the blend films. (d) Kinetic profile of the CS state in PBTZF4:bPDI2P under various excitation intensities. 
Recombination dynamics in PBTZF4:bPDI2P, the higher performing blend, were further investigated by varying the excitation intensity. When the film is excited with a 10 nJ laser pulse energy (4 μJ cm−2), ∼60% of the free charge carriers are still available for collection after 5 ns, but after the same time span only 49% and 45% are available for the 20 nJ and 50 nJ excitations, respectively (Fig. 4d). Increasing excitation energy thus hastens the CS state decay.
Photocurrent – light intensity measurements
The recombination mechanism in the BHJ blends was next probed under device operating conditions by measuring the J–V response curves under varying incident light intensity. The photocurrent densities (Jph) were plotted against the incident light intensities on a log–log scale for different effective voltages (Veff) (Fig. S10†).78,79 The Jph – intensity data can be fit to straight lines, the slopes of which (α) are shown (Fig. S9†). The plots obtained under Jsc conditions, where Jph ≈ Jsc, are reproduced in Fig. 5.57,58,80 At the Jsc condition, α for both blends, 0.92 and 0.88 for PBTZF4:bPDI2P and PBTZF2:bPDI2P, respectively, are significantly higher than 0.75, which indicates that the OPV performance is not limited by space-charge effects.78,79 However, on approaching the Voc conditions along the J–V line, α for both blends approaches 0.75 (at Veff = 0.05 V and 0.1 V for PBTZF4:bPDI2P and PBTZF2:bPDI2P, respectively) indicating the OPV performance in both blends is space-charge limited at low Veff.78,79

Film morphology and microstructure
2D grazing incidence wide angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurements show that all pristine (PBTZF2, PBTZF4 and bDPI2P) and blend (PBTZF2:bDPI2P and PBTZF2:bDPI2P) films are semicrystalline (Fig. 6, S12†). Images are resolved into line cuts in the in-plane (xy) and the out-of-plane (z) directions (Fig. S12†). The pristine films show prominent composite peaks in the side-chain packing region (0.2 < q < 0.5 Å−1) in both the xy and z directions. Note that bPDI2P displays a diffuse isotropic ring at q ≈ 1.45 Å−1. Both polymers show prominent π–π stacking peaks in the out-of-plane direction (qz = 1.73 Å and 1.66 Å−1 for PBTZF4 and PBTZF2, respectively), with the corresponding d-spacings calculated to be 3.68 and 3.78 Å for PBTZF4 and PBTZF2, respectively. These features indicate the “π-face-on” orientation of the polymer aggregates and are retained in the polymer:bPDI2P blends as well.

The microstructures of the present films were also characterized by AFM and the images reveal that the topology of PBTZF4 films is more textured than that of the PBTZF2 films (Fig. S11†). The rms roughness of the neat PBTZF4 films is greater than that of the PBTZF2 films – 2.1 vs. 0.51 nm, respectively, and a similar trend is seen in the BHJ blend films as well, with an rms roughness of 1.82 and 0.39 nm for PBTZF4:bPDI2P and PBTZF2:bPDI2P, respectively.
Discussion
Since the PBTZF2 and PBTZF4 materials characterized here exhibit similar molecular masses and polydispersity characteristics, the origin of the differences between their optoelectronic and charge transport properties can be ascribed largely to their local molecular structures. The additional fluorine atoms in PBTZF4vs.PBTZF2 result in lowered EHOMO and the ELUMO levels in the former polymer, as indicated by both the CV data and DFT computation.32–35,81 The DFT estimated optical band gap of PBTZF4 is somewhat greater than that of PBTZF2 since the EHOMO of the former is lower by 0.17 eV, but ELUMO is lower by only 0.11 eV. Unequal lowering of MO energies has been explained in terms of the unequal inductive and mesomeric effects of fluorine substitution,81,82 and blue-shifting of the band gap has also been reported for several other fluorinated polymers.51,55 However, contrary to these literature reports and the present DFT calculations, the film UV-Vis data indicate that the band gap and λmax of PBTZF4 films are actually slightly red-shifted versus those of PBTZF2. The red-shifted absorption and intensifying of the aggregation shoulder in PBTZF4vs.PBTZF2 are clear indications of backbone planarization, enhanced intramolecular conjugation, and stronger interchain interactions in the former polymer.38,83–85 Note that the DFT calculations performed on oligomers (two repeat units) show that the geometries of the two materials are similar. Moreover, the UV-Vis spectra measured in 1-chloronaphthalene, a strongly de-aggregating solvent,86 reveal that the band gap of PBTZF4 is blue-shifted compared to that of PBTZF2 (Fig. S4†), just as predicted by the computational analysis. This result confirms that substituent effects of additional fluorine atoms in an isolated/solvated PBTZF4 strand should increase the band gap, however the enhanced backbone planarization and intermolecular interactions of the polymer chains in the bulk operate in the opposite direction. Further support for increased planarization in PBTZF4versusPBTZF2 comes from comparative analysis of the ICT and π–π* transitions. The λmax of the PBTZF4 film (593 nm, Table 1), which lies within the ICT peak, is red-shifted versus that of PBTZF2 (586 nm), however the π–π* absorption peak is weakened and blue-shifted in the former over that of the latter polymer (Fig. 2c, λπ–π* of 438 and 440 nm for PBTZF4 and PBTZF4, respectively). This result is suggestive of enhanced orbital mixing between the electron-rich (BDTT) and electron-deficient (BTDT) subunits in the ICT transition, consistent with the increased PBTZF4 planarization.69 Enhanced order, as indicated by the red-shifted absorbance and aggregation shoulder, are common effects of increasing the molecular weights of π-conjugated polymers.71,87 Here we show that fluorination can be equally effective in promoting order via intra and interchain noncovalent fluorophilic interactions.88
The present GIWAXS measurements support the above picture in that the d-spacings of the π–π PBTZF4 aggregates (3.63 Å) are contracted versus the corresponding PBTZF2 aggregates (3.78 Å). Such locally ordered PBTZF4 domains should favor intermolecular coupling and efficient charge transfer, and are consistent with the significantly higher PBTZF4 OFET hole mobility.70,89,90 Furthermore, the d-spacings of the aggregates in the neat films are largely retained when the polymers are blended with bPDI2P. This feature renders PBTZF4:PBTZF2 a superior transporter of free charge carriers versusPBTZF2:bPDI2P. The AFM images of the neat and blend PBTZF4 films also suggest a microstructure that is more favorable for OPV operation. The slower rise of CS state absorption in PBTZF4:bPDI2P as compared to PBTZF2:bPDI2P (Fig. 4c) also suggests that phase segregation is greater in the former.75,91 Enhanced phase segregation is favorable for transport of free charge carriers to the respective electrodes.75,92,93 It is important to point out that extreme levels of phase segregation are a hindrance to OPV operation because excited states that are formed deep inside the domains may not be able to reach the donor/acceptor interface and participate in charge transfer.94 The enhanced phase segregation in PBTZF4versusPBTZF2 however, does not seem to be detrimental to OPV operation as fluorescence in both PBTZF2:bPDI2P and PBTZF4:bPDI2P OPV blend films are quenched to similar levels as compared to the fluorescence of the corresponding pristine polymer films (Fig. S8†).
The present photocurrent – light intensity plots clearly indicate that bimolecular recombination losses are less significant for PBTZF4:bPDI2PversusPBTZF4:bPDI2P (α values of 0.92 versus 0.88, respectively, Fig. 5).13,95 These observations are consistent with the higher FF for PBTZF4:bPDI2P (49.5%) than for PBTZF2:bPDI2P (40%). The molecular and electronic differences between PBTZF4 and PBTZF2 also affect the corresponding Voc and Jsc parameters. Because of the additional fluorination, the EHOMO of PBTZF4 is lower than that of PBTZF2, affording higher Voc in devices fabricated with the former.49,51,53,96 Another factor underlying the higher Voc in PBTZF4:bPDI2P is lowered recombination,97 which as explained above, is the result of its favorable microstructure attained through the increased fluorination. The higher Jsc in PBTZF4:bPDI2P can be primarily attributed to the stronger light absorption in PBTZF4versus that in PBTZF2 – another effect of added fluorination in the former (vide supra). The differences between the optoelectronic properties of PBTZF2 and PBTZF4, as explained in the preceding paragraphs, render the latter a superior p-type material for OPV fabrication, at least when paired with a vast majority of acceptor materials. Since OPV performance is highly dependent on the morphology of the donor/acceptor blends,3 it is possible that despite significantly lower mobility and lower EHOMO, PTBZF2 can afford equitable or even higher performance than PTBZF4, when paired with a different acceptor.
The kinetic profile of the CS state in both the PBTZF2:bPDI2P and PBTZF4:bPDI2P blends exhibits a slow decay at early times (∼1 ns), suggesting that geminate recombination is not a major loss channel.77,98 The fsTA data fit a model that excludes geminate recombination with high agreeability (Fig. 4a, Fig. S10c and d†). Note that fsTA spectroscopy is a very reliable technique to study charge carrier dynamics, especially in earlier timescales where geminate recombination predominates.94,99,100 This result is in contrast to what we and others had previously observed in PDI-based solar cells fabricated with other donor polymers and where geminate recombination was a significant loss mechanism.28,29,68,94,101–103 In fact, geminate recombination has been identified as the mechanism underlying the generally lower performance of PDI-based solar cells in comparison to the corresponding PCBM-based cells.10,94,102–105 In contrast, charge delocalization in PCBM clusters plays an important role in efficient charge separation in PCBM-based BHJ blends.10 While bPDI2P is not a fully planar molecule, the two PDI units are connected via the fused phenanthrene ring, enabling π electron delocalization throughout the molecule.68 Charge delocalization in bPDI2P is therefore a plausible reason for the reduced geminate recombination observed in these systems.73 Importantly, we observe a reduced level of geminate recombination, yet measurable by fsTA, when bPDI2P was paired with a different donor.68 This highlights the role of the donor polymers employed in this study in obtaining the optimal blends to suppress geminate recombination.106
The PCE of the present cells is limited by relatively low FFs (<50%). Among other factors, OPV FFs are sensitive to charge recombination,107 and if geminate recombination is not operative (vide supra), then bimolecular recombination is likely the dominant pathway.108 Under short circuit conditions, the α values for both PBTZF4:bPDI2P and PBTZF2:bPDI2P are lower than 1.0, arguing that bimolecular recombination is the dominant loss mechanism at/near Jsc.13,95,109,110 High internal fields exist at/near the Jsc condition and help sweep the charges to the electrodes, but at/near the Voc condition, the internal field and sweep-out speed are relatively low.109 Under low internal voltages, α in both blends approaches 0.75, showing that the device parameters are space-charge-limited at/near the Voc condition.78,79 The fact that current is space-charge limited under low voltages supports our contention that geminate recombination is negligible in the present blends.111 Moreover, the fsTA data provide further support for this picture because increasing the excitation intensity hastens the CS state decay rate in PBTZF4:bPDI2P (Fig. 4d), something that would only occur if bimolecular recombination were significant since it depends on free charge density.76 The low FF in the present materials can thus be associated with voltage-dependent carrier recombination and not with voltage dependent carrier generation.107 Therefore, the performance of the bPDI2P-based cells is not fundamentally limited by geminate recombination, and potentially could be increased by tuning the PBTZF4:bPDI2P blend morphology, e.g., via processing additives and/or engineering the polymer side chains.49,112
Conclusions
A new semiconducting π-donor material featuring the tetra-fluorinated repeat unit, PBTZF4, was designed, synthesized, characterized, and employed in BHJ fullerene-free solar cells. Systematic study of PBTZF4 physicochemical, morphological, and optoelectronic properties, together with a comparison of those to that of its underfluorinated analogue PBTZF2, were made. PBTZF4 adopts a more planar backbone conformation with enhanced aggregation, resulting in enhanced light absorption and higher p-type field effect mobility. These factors as well as complementary PBTZF4/bPDI2P photon absorption and reduced geminate recombination of the blend, noteworthy for fullerene-free BHJ solar cells, contribute collectively to achieving a substantial 5.55% solar cell PCE.
