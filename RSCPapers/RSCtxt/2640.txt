    , Accepted 2nd January 2016First published on 4th January 2016AbstractWe report on two novel p-type small molecules with a donor–acceptor molecular structure for application to green-light-selective organic photodiodes (OPDs). To achieve the requirement of high light selectivity and sensitivity, an electron-donating aryl amino moiety is combined with two respective electron-accepting heterocycles so that the molecules approach cyanine-like character, characterized by intense and sharp absorption. Molecular stacking is controlled by the addition of bulky aryl functional groups to the main backbone to further control the electrical charge transport properties. With this molecular design, a maximum external quantum efficiency close to 61% (λmax = 550 nm) and a dark-current density below 1.6 nA cm−2 (or specific detectivity D* = 1.19 × 1013 cm Hz1/2 W−1) at an applied reverse bias of 3 V are obtained when mixed with fullerene (C60) in an inverted-structure bulk heterojunction OPD composed of two transparent electrodes. The potential construction of a full-color photodetector or an image sensor is demonstrated by combining the green-light-selective OPD with a silicon photodiode containing solely blue and red color filters in a stacked architecture.
Introduction
The field of organic electronics, driven by the successful commercialization of organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs), is now expanding toward other applications, such as organic solar cells (OSCs),1,2 organic photodiodes (OPDs),3,4 and organic photodetectors.5–15 For the molecular design of p-type semiconductor materials, the push–pull approach consisting of building molecules with alternating electron-donating and electron-accepting moieties has been widely investigated for OSCs.16–19 These materials potentially gave high external quantum efficiency (EQE), while the push–pull mechanism associated with the electron-donating and electron-accepting units led to a decrease in the band-gap and an extended absorption range. Because of the large absorption range, this approach would apparently be inappropriate for the OPDs that require an intense and sharp absorption for color selectivity and sensitivity. It was however shown that in the case of organic push–pull dyes for nonlinear optics (NLO) application, it is possible to design molecules with an intense and sharp absorption.20–22 In terms of the absorption properties of the push–pull dyes for the NLO, regardless of their electrical properties, the strength of the donor (D) (or push) and the acceptor (A) (or pull) parts should be well counter-balanced, so that the D–A molecule changes its character from a polyene-like molecule to a cyanine-like molecule. A cyanine limit was then defined, which corresponds to the minimization of the difference between the dipole in the excited state and the dipole in the ground state (Δμ).23 In the cyanine limit, the electronic structure of the dyes is close to the resonance limit, characterized by an equal contribution of the neutral and zwitterionic resonance structures.24–26 Despite not strictly defined, a Δμ value approaching 2 or below would be ideal in terms of molecular conjugation to get a sharp and intense absorption.
In this study, we therefore apply the D–A (or push–pull) approach to the design of two novel p-type small molecules to use them as chromophores for green-light-selective OPDs. The strength of the D and A was carefully chosen to remain rather close to the cyanine limit while tuning the absorption to the green region of the visible spectrum. We show that the combination of electron-donating aryl amino group with heterocyclic acceptors was appropriate to get intense and sharp green absorption. The D–A small molecules with strong polarity are prone to extended stacking along their main axis, with their dipole aligned in the opposite direction.27 Such a stacking manner has a positive effect for the optoelectronic properties such as the OPD efficiency, because of the elimination of the single molecular electrical dipoles that increase entropic disorders and impede charge transport properties. Extensive stacking might however negatively affect the performance of the OPD by increasing the dark-current (DC) and the absorption width (full width at half maximum (FWHM)). We thus controlled the stacking properties by functionalizing the electron-donating aryl amino unit with phenyl and naphthyl groups that lies outside the plane of the main molecular axis. Thanks to the high performing intrinsic molecular properties and an optimized stacking arrangement of the molecules, an inverted-structure green-light-selective OPD composed of two transparent electrodes was developed by mixing the D–A molecules with fullerene (C60). The device exhibited a maximum EQE close to 61% (λmax = 550 nm) and a DC density below 1.6 nA cm−2 (or specific detectivity D* = 1.19 × 1013 cm Hz1/2 W−1) at an applied reverse bias of 3 V, corresponding to our knowledge among the highest green-light-selective OPD performances reported so far.1–15
Results and discussion
The new D–A molecules 1a and 1b were synthesized via the synthetic routes shown in Fig. 1a with very high reaction yields, and their molecular structures were completely characterized via nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, mass spectroscopy, and elemental analysis (see the Experimental section). To increase the strength of the D part, an electron-rich thiophene group was used as a linker between the donating aryl amino group and the two respective accepting heterocycles a and b used as the A units.28Fig. 1b represents the optimized molecular configuration of the two molecules at the B3LYP level of the DFT method with the 6-31G(d,p) basis set, calculated using Gaussian09.29 In the minimum energy configuration, the methine group is oriented so that the oxygen of one of the carboxyl groups is in the close vicinity of the sulfur of the thiophene group, presumably because of electrostatic interactions.27 The conjugation of the molecules stabilizes the main backbone in a planar configuration, while the phenyl and naphthyl groups lay outside the backbone plane. An experimental nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (NOESY) revealed that one of the protons at the ortho-positions of the phenyl group showed an apparent NOE with a proton of the thiophene moiety through space correlation (see Fig. S1 in the ESI† for the NOESY spectra). The out-of-plane orientation of the phenyl and naphthyl groups gives a 3-dimensional shape characteristic to the molecules. Table 1 summarizes the basic optoelectronic properties of the two molecules and Fig. 1c and d show, respectively, the visible absorption spectra in toluene solutions and in thermally-evaporated thin films. The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level is lower for 1b because of the stronger A strength of b as compared with that of a. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level is as expected less impacted by the change in the A strength leading to a smaller band gap for 1b and to the observed red-shifted absorption as compared with that of 1a. The calculated polarity of the molecules in the ground state, the polarity difference between the ground state and the excited state, as well as the polarity of the respective molecular dimers in the ground state are also reported in Table 1. The dimers were selected by taking the minimum energy configuration among those generated by using the module Blends in the Materials Studio package,30 as shown in Fig. 1e, after assigning electrostatic potential (ESP) charges to each molecule by using the module DMol3. The energetically favorable configurations were obtained by using a sampling technique based on the excluded-volume constraints method and the molecular Silverware algorithm.31,32 The polarity in the ground state is slightly higher for 1a and its Δμ is lower as compared with that of 1b. The two D–A molecules approach the cyanine limit arbitrary fixed at 2. In our molecular design, thiophene was chosen, in addition to strengthen the electron-donating character of D, because of its rather low aromatic stabilization favoring the zwitterionic structure through charge delocalization.25 The combination with the two respective A units in this study, necessary to tune the maximum absorption in the desired wavelength range, is however not perfect yet to get the compounds with a fully cyanine-like character, especially with b having a larger accepting strength.24 The Δμ values in Table 1 originates from a larger dipole moment in the excited state than in the ground state. This implies a positive first molecular hyperpolarizability and shows that the two molecules, while approaching the cyanine limit, still possess a rather neutral-like character than a zwitterion-like character.25 In addition, when comparing both molecules, the slightly smaller hole internal reorganization energy of 1a as compared with that of 1b is consistent with the smaller Δμ value of 1a (λi,h = 0.210 eV for 1a, λi,h = 0.216 eV for 1b). For the reorganization energy calculation, the geometry optimization of the neutral and cationic states were obtained using the B3LYP hybrid density functional and the 6-31G(d,p) basis set.33 Finally, the electrical dipole moment of the dimer in the x-direction, which approximately corresponds to the main axis of the molecule, nearly vanished for both molecules in the ground state. The magnitudes of the dimer dipole moment reported in Table 1 are similar to the z-component of the vector. The so-designed D–A molecules, despite not having an exact cyanine-like character, possess the basic characteristics to work as efficient absorbers, in the green in our case, with intense and sharp absorption, as confirmed by Fig. 1c and d (absorption coefficient α = 1.29 × 105 cm−1 at λabsfilmmax = 515 nm, FWHM = 83 nm for 1a and α = 1.38 × 105 cm−1 at λabsfilmmax = 547 nm, FWHM = 83 nm for 1b). The more intense absorption of 1b is thus likely induced by the extended conjugation of this molecule having a naphthyl group as an A unit, since its cyanine-like character was less pronounced than 1a. In addition, an apparent bathochromic shift at the ground state absorption is observed in thermally-evaporated thin films (λabssolnmax = 512 nm versus λabsfilmmax = 515 nm for 1a and λabssolnmax = 539 nm versus λabsfilmmax = 547 nm for 1b), which would rather be the hallmark of a J-type aggregation, especially observed in optoelectronic molecules that exhibit a quasi-head-to-tail arrangement.34 The significant fluorescence enhancement from liquid solution to solid film, measured by absolute photoluminescence (PL) quantum yield (Φ) excited at the wavelength of 365 nm, and an accompanied strong bathochromic shift in the emission support the J-type aggregation (Φsoln = 0.7% at ca. 2.5 × 10−5 M, λemsolnmax = 558 nm versus Φfilm = 3.9%, λemfilmmax = 687 nm for 1a and Φsoln = 2.0% at ca. 2.5 × 10−5 M, λemsolnmax = 580 nm versus Φfilm = 4.3%, λemfilmmax = 727 nm for 1b, see Fig. S2 in the ESI† for the PL spectra).35,36 This stacking type is well consistent with the simulated dimer configurations shown in Fig. 1e. The presence of the naphthyl and phenyl groups outside the main backbone plane prevents the formation of H-type aggregation by steric hindrance, as well as the exact parallel stacking of adjacent molecules along the backbone main axis.

The two respective p-type D–A molecules were then mixed with C60 as the n-type material via thermal co-evaporation under high vacuum (<10−7 Torr) to form the bulk heterojunction (BHJ) active layers. C60 was selected as an n-type molecule in this study because of its fairly low absorbance in the visible light spectrum and its high charge carrier mobility in the thin-film state.37 The mixing properties between the respective p-type D–A molecules and the n-type C60 were then estimated by using the module Blends in the Materials Studio package. Blends is used to predict the thermodynamics of mixing based on the interaction energy of contacting pairs of molecules, which allows the calculation of the mixing energy and the interaction parameter χ based on an off-lattice generalization of the Flory–Huggins theory.32,38 The χ parameters were, respectively, 2.23 for the 1a:C60 system and 8.92 for 1b:C60. The larger number for the 1b:C60 blend indicates a stronger predisposition of this system for de-mixing. The respective minimum energy D–A molecule:C60 configurations obtained after the calculation with the module Blends are represented in Fig. 2a, which shows a slightly more compact structure for 1a:C60. We do not here intend to simulate the representative dimers corresponding to the real morphology of the thin films, but simply to visualize the preferred interactions between the respective D–A molecules and C60. The morphologies of the blend thin films were further analyzed by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and the height images of 1a:C60 (root mean square (RMS) roughness: 0.45 nm) and 1b:C60 (RMS roughness: 0.60 nm) are represented in Fig. 2b. The morphology of 1b:C60 is coarser, which correlates with the larger χ parameter of this blend. Despite the inhomogeneous areas, it is not possible to observe phase-separated domains, for both blends. We additionally intended to highlight any possible crystalline areas by X-ray diffraction analysis, but both blends show an amorphous structure. Grazing incidence wide angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) analysis was therefore carried out to check the local molecular arrangement in the respective blend films. The GIWAXS spectra in Fig. 2c confirm the rather amorphous characteristics of both blends, but a degree of local arrangement is nonetheless expected, in particular for the BHJ of 1b:C60. A preferred alignment in a direction parallel to the surface is to be observed for this blend. By comparison with the C60 diffraction spectra and the respective single thin films (see Fig. S3 in the ESI†), it appears that this orientation is rather induced by C60 than by 1b itself. By combining the simulation results, AFM images, and GIWAXS data, the effect of the change of heterocycles a by b is to induce less favorable interactions with C60, leading to the eventual de-mixing with C60 (without phase separation) that can then re-arrange in a locally stacked area. It is likely that the rigid naphthyl moiety contained in the accepting heterocycles of 1b leads to a stronger intermolecular interaction between the neighboring 1b molecules.

(e) Visible absorption spectra of 1a:C60 (black line: α = 0.58 × 105 cm−1 at λabsfilmmax = 522 nm, FWHM = 82 nm, Φfilm = 0.5%) and 1b:C60 (blue line: α = 0.60 × 105 cm−1 at λabsfilmmax = 550 nm, FWHM = 83 nm, Φfilm = 0.4%). 
The hole and electron-dominant charge-carrier mobilities of the two BHJ blend compositions were then measured (see the Experimental section).39 The results in Fig. 2d and Fig. S4a (see the ESI†) show higher hole and electron-dominant mobilities for 1b:C60, in particular at the lower electric field in the case of hole mobility. In an OPD made of a BHJ architecture, the efficiency properties depend on the number of charges generated at the interface of the grain boundary composed of p-type and n-type materials, which is defined as the charge separation efficiency (ηcs), and then to their effective transport to the electrodes, which is defined as the charge collection efficiency (ηcc). In the case of 1b:C60, a certain level of molecular de-mixing coupled to a better molecular stacking of segregated domains without extended phase separation certainly positively affects the charge-carrier mobilities leading to the higher ηcs and ηcc. Finally the absorption profiles for both BHJ blends are represented in Fig. 2e.
To characterize the actual optoelectronic properties of the BHJ blends, inverted-structure green-light-selective OPDs consisting of indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass substrates, BHJs of 1a or 1b and C60 (volume ratio, 1:1), a hole-extraction layer of molybdenum oxides (MoOx), and an ITO contact were fabricated (see the Experimental section and Fig. 3a inset).40 Notably, transparent ITO electrodes on both sides of the OPDs were used to evaluate the green-light-selectivity. Representative current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the OPDs with 85 nm-thick BHJs and a blend volume ratio of 1:1 under dark conditions are presented in Fig. 3a and the detailed device characteristics are reported in Table 2. The diodes exhibited fairly low DC density (Jd) of 2.77 nA cm−2 (173 e s−1 μm−2) for 1a:C60 and 25.69 nA cm−2 (1603 e s−1 μm−2) for 1b:C60 at a reverse bias of 3 V, which was the operating voltage used in this study. As shown in Fig. 3b, furthermore, the EQE curves of the OPDs driven at the 3 V bias exhibited remarkably high selectivity to the external green light, displaying FWHMs as narrow as 98 nm for 1a:C60 and 101 nm for 1b:C60, which is attributed to the narrow absorption profile of the BHJs formed by 1a or 1b and C60 (Fig. 2e), resulting in strong symbatic responses.41 Plots of the EQE as a function of applied reverse biases are presented in Fig. 3b (right-hand). Rather low EQEs of 14.13% for 1a:C60 and 16.28% for 1b:C60 were obtained without any external reverse bias (0 V), but a drastic increase in efficiency was observed at the reverse bias of 3 V, with the EQEs of 47.48% for 1a:C60 and 51.98% for 1b:C60. These enhanced EQE values upon applied bias are attributed to the electric-field assisted charge-carrier mobilities, which lead to the higher ηcs and ηcc, as a result of the minimization of charge recombination loss, as previously described (see Table 2 and Fig. S4b in the ESI† for more details).15,42 Furthermore, the internal quantum efficiency (IQE) was estimated to be as high as 74.19% for 1a:C60 and 78.76% for 1b:C60 at the reverse bias of 3 V based on the calculated absorptance (ηA) of 0.64 (1a:C60) and 0.66 (1b:C60) of the BHJs. In terms of these device characteristics, which can be described by the expression EQE = ηA × IQE = ηA × ηcs × ηcc, the main difference between the two p-type D–A molecules is therefore the higher EQE obtained with 1b:C60 under the same conditions. This better EQE performance is mainly attributed to the higher ηcs and ηcc values thanks to the higher charge-carrier mobilities in the 1b:C60 blend, correlated with the larger IQE, along with a slightly higher blend coefficient of absorption (or ηA). One sees that more pronounced local molecular stacking observed for 1b:C60 is effective in improving the charge-carrier mobilities, for the better IQE and improved final EQE of the device with the higher ηA. It is also to be highlighted that a high Δμ value might be an indicator of good IQE in OPDs, as the degree of photo-induced intermolecular charge transfer is related to the difference between the ground and excited state dipole moment.43 This is well consistent with our data, with the higher ηcs value for the p-type material with the larger Δμ value. In contrast, the DC increased for this 1b:C60 blend composition, even though the hole-injection barrier of the 1b:C60 blend from the cathode ITO is 0.1 eV higher than that of the 1a:C60,14 which is a negative effect of stacking on OPD properties. Molecular stacking has thus an opposite effect depending on which device property is considered. It is noteworthy that a trade-off would then exist between the IQE and the DC in the field of OPDs.

As the new D–A molecule 1b gave improved OPD characteristics, especially with a better ηA and IQE, its green-light-selective OPD properties were further investigated for different device fabrication and experimental conditions. The device efficiency performance was first optimized by varying the volume ratios of 1b:C60 and the total thicknesses of the BHJ. The optimal structure was found to be a 150 nm-thick BHJ for a 1:1 volume ratio (see Fig. S5 in the ESI† for the efficiency contour plots). As presented in Fig. 4a, the diode exhibited a very low Jd of 1.60 nA cm−2 (100 e s−1 μm−2) at the reverse bias of 3 V and a high injection current of 2.71 × 10−4 A cm−2 at a forward bias of −3 V, leading to a very high rectification ratio of 1.69 × 105 at ±3 V. From the EQE curve presented in Fig. 4b, the spectral responsivity (R) of the OPD was evaluated (see the Experimental section), and reached a high Rmax of 0.27 A W−1 (EQEmax of 60.95%) at a wavelength of 550 nm for the reverse bias of 3 V. The figure of merit known as the specific detectivity (D*) was then evaluated by using the expression D* = R/(2qJd)0.5. A very high D* of 1.19 × 1013 cm Hz1/2 W−1 was obtained at a wavelength of 550 nm under the reverse bias of 3 V. In this estimation, the shot noise from the DC was considered to be the major contributor to the total noise of the OPD.6 These remarkably improved DC and EQE values, when compared with the OPD having the original BHJ thickness of 85 nm, are attributed to the lower electric field but the better green light absorbance for the larger BHJ thicknesses. The larger thickness also led to an excellent thermal stability (see Fig. S6 in the ESI†). The device additionally responded to the external green light (λmax = 553 nm), and the response behavior of the photocurrent density (Jph) versus the light intensity (I) exhibited good linearity as illustrated in Fig. 4c (right-hand). The photo-response speed behavior, which is a critical parameter for image processing in OPDs,44 is illustrated in Fig. 4d. Rapid rise time (τrise = 202 μs at 0 V and 58 μs at 3 V, 0–99.5%) was obtained for the device at the −3 dB frequency, at which the amplitude of the photocurrent decreased to 1/√2 of its initial value.15,44 As this green-light-selective OPD exhibited a fairly high transmittance for wavelengths in the blue and red regions, it could furthermore be combined in a stacked architecture to a silicon photodiode, which detected the transmitted blue and red light through the respective color filters (Fig. 4e inset). A hybrid stacked full-color photodetector was built, characterized by fairly balanced EQEs of the blue, green, and red light, as demonstrated in Fig. 4e. The EQE spectrum of the top-layer green-light-selective OPD shows a shoulder in the wavelength region under 500 nm due to the absorbance of the C60, which could be reduced by using transparent or magenta-coloured non-fullerene n-type compounds or C60 derivatives carrying other functionalities. These results strongly suggest that a BHJ blend consisting of p-type 1b and n-type C60 organic molecules can be applied to various optoelectronic devices such as green-wavelength-selective OSCs, X-ray scintillation detectors, and the next-generation organic-on-silicon hybrid complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) color image sensors, which was demonstrated by our research group recently.15

The inset shows the device structure. (b) EQE as a function of the wavelength of incident light obtained at a bias value of 3 V. (c) J–V curves under illuminated (λmax = 553 nm) conditions (0.5–10.0 mW cm−2). The right-hand figure reveals good linearity in the behavior of the photocurrent density (Jph) versus the light intensity (I) at the bias value of 3 V. (d) Rise photocurrent behavior responded to external green light (λmax = 553 nm) as a function of time at the bias value of 0 V (black line) and 3 V (blue line). (e) EQE curves of blue, green, and red photodiodes. The EQEs of the blue and red regions were calculated by optical simulations using the n and k values of each layer and the IQE curve of the underlying silicon photodiode. The EQE of the green-light-selective OPD was measured directly at the operating voltage of 3 V. 
Conclusion
Two newly designed and synthesized D–A molecules 1a and 1b approaching the cyanine limit were presented in this study satisfying the requirements as active materials in green-light-selective OPDs, characterized by high selectivities, very low DC densities, and high photo-conversion efficiencies, when mixed with C60. Considering the use of two transparent ITO electrodes on both sides of the OPD composed of the BHJ blend of 1b:C60, the maximum EQE value close to 61% (λmax = 550 nm) and a DC density below 1.6 nA cm−2 (or D* = 1.19 × 1013 cm Hz1/2 W−1) at an applied reverse bias of 3 V, accompanied by a very distinct green-light-selectivity, an excellent thermal stability, and linear and rapid photo-response characteristics, are among the highest records reported in this field, to date. The green-light-detection ability of the OPD was demonstrated by constructing a hybrid stacked-type full-color photodetector composed of this green-light-selective OPD top layer and a bottom silicon photodiode for the additional detection of blue and red light. To achieve this level of performance, importantly, the first key point in the molecular design was a suitable combination of the D and A units to build a new D–A molecule approaching a cyanine-like character, characterized by sharp and intense absorption. The second key factor was the choice of the additional functional groups to control the stacking manner of the molecules in the molecular blends with C60, connected to the trade-off-like IQE and DC properties of the OPDs. It appears that in the development of high performing D–A materials for OPDs, consequently, the choice of the D and A strength combination should be done in parallel with the control of the 3-dimensional configuration of the molecules to optimize the OPD properties. This study gives thus important points to be considered in the design of new D–A molecules for optoelectronic applications. This study also validates the use of organic push–pull dye molecules to be incorporated into various optoelectronic devices with high efficiencies, and widens the scope of applications of p-type organic semiconductor materials.
Experimental section
Instrumentation

1H-NMR and 13C-NMR spectra were obtained using a Bruker Avance III 600 (600 MHz) instrument with methylene chloride-d2 (CD2Cl2) and chloroform-d (CDCl3) as the solvents. Mass spectra were recorded using a TOF LC/MS (Shimadzu) in ESI positive mode. Elemental analysis was performed using a PE 2400 Series II analyzer. UV-visible absorption spectra were acquired using a Varian Cary 500 Bio spectrophotometer. The HOMO levels of all organic thin films were measured using an AC-2 photoelectron spectrophotometer (Hitachi High Tech). The LUMO levels were determined from the optical band gap calculated from the edge of the absorption spectra. Absolute PL quantum yields excited at the wavelength of 365 nm were measured using a Quantaurus-QY spectrometer (Hamamatsu C11347). The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the OPDs were measured using a Keithley K4200 parameter analyzer. The photocurrent characteristics were evaluated under illumination with a green laser diode (λmax = 553 nm) at various light intensities in the range of 0.5–10 mW cm−2. EQEs were measured using an instrumental setup illuminated with monochromatic light generated by an ozone-free xenon lamp with a chopper frequency of 30 Hz. The monochromatic light intensity was calibrated using a silicon photodiode (Hamamatsu S1337). The corresponding R (A W−1), defined as the ratio of the generated photocurrent (A) to the incident light power (W), was calculated from the EQE using the relation R = EQE/hν, where hν is the incident photon energy in electron volts (eV). The frequency response was evaluated using a measurement setup consisting of an oscilloscope with a bandwidth of 500 MHz (LeCroy Wavejet 352A), an AFG-2125 function generator (GW Instek), and a green laser diode (λmax = 553 nm, power = 10 mW cm−2).
Syntheses of 1a and 1b
To a mixture of 5-(naphthalen-1-yl(phenyl)amino)thiophene-2-carbaldehyde (1, 1 mmol) and 1H-indene-1,3(2H)-dione (a, 1.1 mmol) or 1H-cyclopenta[b]naphthalene-1,3(2H)-dione (b, 1.1 mmol) anhydrous ethanol (EtOH) (20 mL) was added at room temperature. The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 30 min, to which was added a drop of piperidine by using a syringe. The reaction mixture was further stirred at 85 °C for 6 h and was cooled to room temperature. After the mixture was quenched with H2O, the resulting solid was collected via filtration and was thoroughly washed with H2O and hexanes, to afford reddish brown solids. The solid products were further purified via column chromatography on silica gel (chloroform/ethyl acetate = 9/1). The resulting product was recrystallized from dichloromethane/hexanes (yield = 93–95%).

Fullerene (C60)
This material was purchased from commercial suppliers (sublimed grade) and used as received.
Fabrication of organic thin films
All organic semiconductor materials were purified via sublimation under high vacuum (<10−6 Torr) prior to use. Thin films were fabricated via thermal evaporation under high vacuum (<10−7 Torr) at a rate of 0.5–1.0 Å s−1 on dried glass or quartz substrates that had been cleaned with isopropyl alcohol (IPA) and acetone in an ultrasonic cleaner.
Fabrication of OPDs
Inverted-structure green-light-selective OPDs were fabricated on cleaned ITO-coated glass substrates by sequentially depositing an 85 to 150 nm-thick organic BHJ blends layer of 1a or 1b and C60 (volume ratio, 1:1) via thermal co-evaporation under high vacuum (<10−7 Torr), a 30 nm-thick hole-extraction layer of MoOxvia thermal evaporation under high vacuum (<10−7 Torr), and an ITO electrode using a sputter system. Then, the OPDs were encapsulated with glass (transmittance = 90%). The active pixel size, defined by the orthogonal overlap of the two ITO electrodes, was 0.04 cm2.
Measurement of charge-carrier mobilities of the BHJs
The OPDs consisting of ITO/MoOx (30 nm)/1a or 1b:C60 (volume ratio, 1:1)/ITO (hole-only device) and ITO/MoOx (30 nm)/1a or 1b:C60 (volume ratio, 1:1)/Al (electron-dominant device) were fabricated to extract the hole and electron-dominant charge-carrier mobilities of the BHJs using the impedance measurement method according to the literature.39
Estimation of ηcs and ηcc in the OPDs
The ηcs was estimated by measuring the PL quenching efficiency under various electric fields via the instrumental setup of time-resolved PL spectroscopy (FluoTime 300, PicoQuant GmbH) according to the literature.45 The ηcc was then evaluated using the expression EQE = ηA × IQE = ηA × ηcs × ηcc.
