    , Accepted 23rd September 2017First published on 25th September 2017AbstractTwo small molecular cathode interlayer (CIL) materials with pyridinium ion or quaternary ammonium ion terminated 1,2,3-trihexyloxybenzene as pendant polar groups and anthrathiadiazole-4,11-dione (ATD) as a conjugated backbone, namely PBATD and TBATD, were synthesized for PCDTBT:PC71BM (PCDTBT:poly[poly[N-9′-heptadecanyl-2,7-carbazole-alt-5,5-(4′,7′-di-2-thienyl-2′,1′,3′-benzothiadiazole)]]; PC71BM:[6,6]-phenyl C71-butyric acid methyl ester) based polymer solar cells (PSCs). A dramatic improvement in the device performance was observed when the CILs were inserted between the active layer and the Al electrode. Especially, the device modified by quaternary ammonium ion terminated TBATD exhibits a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 7.26%, which was 1.4 times that of the device with bare Al as the cathode, due to the simultaneously enhanced open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current density (Jsc) and fill factor (FF). Importantly, the Voc (0.93 V) achieved for the TBATD modified device was among the top values that used the same kind of active layer in conventional single-junction PSCs so far. It demonstrated that the CILs presented in this study may be a promising candidate for applications in high performance PSCs.
Introduction
Bulk heterojunction polymer solar cells (PSCs) have been extensively studied due to their unique features, such as potentially low fabrication cost, large area and flexibility.1 Lots of attention has been paid to designing and synthesizing new active layer materials such as polymer donors2 and nonfullerene acceptors3 to improve power conversion efficiency (PCE). PCE values exceeding 12% have been achieved for single junction solar cells,4 showing the bright future of PSCs. However, to design efficient and stable OSCs, apart from the innovation of new photoactive materials, it is well worth focusing on interfacial engineering.5 Reducing the interfacial energy barriers is an efficient way to facilitate electron extraction from the active layer to the cathode.6 The introduction of a cathode interfacial layer (CIL), which is inserted between the active layer and the cathode, could provide PSCs with a high PCE through an increased open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current density (Jsc), and fill factor (FF).7 Many materials including low work function metals (e.g. Ca, Ba, etc.),8 metal oxides (e.g., ZnO, TiOX, etc.),9 metal salts (LiF, CsF, Cs2CO3, etc.)10 and alcohol/water-soluble organic or polymeric electrolytes11 have successfully been used to enhance the PCEs of PSCs as CILs. Compared to other CIL materials, the alcohol/water-soluble organic or polymeric materials are more suitable for solution based device fabrication for roll to roll processes due to their orthogonal solvent processability, which can avoid intermixing between the active layer and the interlayer.12 For example, as a typical cathode interfacial material, the alcohol/water-soluble polymer, poly[(9,9-dioctyl-2,7-fluorene)-alt-(9,9-bis(30-(N,N-dimethylamino)propyl)-2,7-fluorene)] (PFN), has been widely used since Wu and co-workers employed PFN in a conventionally structured PSC and obtained a PCE of 8.37% in 2011.13
Whereas, compared to polymers, small molecule based CILs are more attractive because of the advantage of well-defined structures, simple synthesis and purification processes, and good batch to batch reproducibility.14 Therefore, lots of successful alcohol/water-soluble small molecules have been applied, such as fullerene derivatives,15 perylene diimides,16 porphyrin derivatives,17 metallophthalocyanine (MPc) derivatives18 and so on. Generally, CILs contain a conjugated backbone to ensure good charge transportability, and highly polar terminal groups endowing them with good water/alcohol solubility. Firstly, a range of quaternary ammonium ion terminated conjugated polyelectrolytes were employed as electron transport/injection layers in polymer light-emitting diodes (PLEDs) by Bazan and co-workers in 2006.19 Many amino-functional CILs have been developed and used in PSCs, for example, Peng and co-workers have synthesized a series of small molecular interlayers with variable polar terminals and applied them in PSCs. It was reported that an efficiency exceeding 10% was achieved when the quaternary ammonium ions were selected.20 However, high performance small molecular CILs remain quite rare. In this context, we focus on the development of novel CIL materials based on new polar side moieties and n-type small conjugated molecules. We employed pyridinium ion or quaternary ammonium ion terminated 1,2,3-trihexyloxybenzene as the dipole moiety, which could connect with a majority of the conjugated backbone. Anthrathiadiazole-4,11-dione was used as the n-type backbone due to its strong electron-deficient character and low-lying LUMO (lowest unoccupied molecular orbital) level. Therefore, the proposed CILs may facilitate electron transport from the fullerene to the cathode because of the reduced energy barrier at the interface.21 As a kind of electron-deficient backbone, anthrathiadiazole derivatives have been shown to have good charge transport properties, and have been widely used in the field of organic electron devices such as organic photovoltaic devices (OPVs) and organic field-effect transistors (OFETs).22 Therefore, the anthrathiadiazole-4,11-dione skeleton is expected to be further applied in the field of cathode modification.
In this contribution, two alcohol/water-soluble anthrathiadiazole derivatives that employed pyridinium ions or quaternary ammonium ions as the pendant amino functionalities, and anthrathiadiazole-4,11-dione as the conjugated backbone, namely PBATD and TBATD, respectively, were designed and synthesized (Fig. 1a). They were applied as CILs in PSCs with PCDTBT:PC71BM (PCDTBT:poly[N-9′-heptadecanyl-2,7-carbazole-alt-5,5-(4′,7′-di-2-thienyl-2′,1′,3′-benzothiadiazole)]; PC71BM:[6,6]-phenyl C71-butyric acid methyl ester) as the active layer (Fig. 1b and c). When PBATD or TBATD was inserted between the active layer and the cathode, the performances were significantly improved due to the simultaneous enhancement of the open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current density (Jsc), and fill factor (FF). Furthermore, two CILs with different terminal ions were systematically compared in this work. Especially, it should be noted that the TBATD modified device exhibited a Voc of 0.93 V and a PCE of 7.26%, which were among the top values that used the same kind of active layer in conventional single-junction PSCs so far.23 Although the PBATD modified device showed slightly lower Voc (0.92 V) and PCE (6.98%) values, they are still at a high level, indicating that both molecules are promising CIL materials for the fabrication of high performance PSCs.

Results and discussion
The intermediate THBBr-ATD was synthesised by Suzuki coupling of Br-ATD and 3,4,5-tris((6-bromohexyl)oxy)phenyl pinacolato borolane (PBE-THBBr). The ionization of THBBr-ATD with pyridine or trimethylamine was then performed to afford PBATD or TBATD, respectively. The detailed synthetic procedures for these compounds are shown in Scheme 1 and Scheme S1 (see the ESI†). The molecular structures of the intermediates and the target molecules were well confirmed using 1H NMR, elemental analysis and mass spectrometry. Both PBATD and TBATD have good solubility in methanol and trifluoroethanol, but are insoluble in chlorobenzene or o-dichlorobenzene. This orthogonal solubility with respect to the polymers and fullerenes could be utilized to avoid damage to the underlying layers and give an opportunity for the solution-processed fabrication of multilayer devices. Optical absorption spectra of PBATD and TBATD in methanol and in thin films are shown in Fig. 2a. PBATD and TBATD showed similar absorption spectra because of their identical conjugate backbones. Both of the two CIL molecules showed a broadened and red-shifted absorption in the thin film phase, indicating aggregation of the molecular backbones. The optical band gaps (Eoptg) were determined to be 2.44 eV for PBATD and 2.50 eV for TBATD, respectively, based on the corresponding solid thin film absorption onsets. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were performed to determine the frontier molecular orbitals of the molecules (Fig. 2b). Based on the reduction potential onset, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of PBATD and TBATD were estimated to be −3.68 and −3.67 eV, which were in agreement with the expectation. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels of these molecules were obtained to be −6.12 and −6.17 eV, based on the LUMO energy levels and the optical band gaps (Eoptg). The data are summarized in Table 1. From the energy level alignment in Fig. 3, the deep LUMOs of the CILs could facilitate electron transfer to the cathode from the fullerene due to the narrowed energy barrier at this interface and the low-lying HOMOs could also help prevent the transfer of holes to the cathode.

To investigate the interfacial modification ability of PBATD and TBATD, PSCs were fabricated with a configuration of [ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PCDTBT:PC71BM/CIL/Al] (ITO:indium tin oxide, PEDOT:PSS:poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate)) (Fig. 1b and c). The two CILs were deposited onto the active layer by spin-coating from the mixed solvent of methanol and trifluoroethanol (1:4, v/v) solutions. Compared with the pure methanol, the mixed solvent (methanol:trifluoroethanol) displayed better wettability on the active layer surface and was selected as a solvent for CIL materials. Trifluoroethanol is easily volatile (boiling point: 73.6 °C) and the residual trifluoroethanol could be easily removed under high vacuum before Al was thermally deposited as the cathode. Different concentrations of CIL molecules in the solution were tested and the optimized concentrations were found to be 0.4 mg mL−1 for PBATD and 0.8 mg mL−1 for TBATD (2000 rpm spin speed), respectively. The thicknesses of the CILs were monitored by different concentrations and are listed in Table S1 (ESI†). The optimized thickness of the CILs is around 2 nm for PBATD and 4 nm for TBATD, respectively. For comparison, two control devices were also fabricated, they are the Al-only device without the CIL and the solvent-treated device by spin-coating the mixed solvent (methanol:trifluoroethanol = 1:4, v/v) on the active layer. Fig. 4a shows the current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the devices under 100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5G irradiation and the performance parameters are summarized in Table 2. More than 20 pixels (size = 2 × 2 mm2) were measured for each configuration and the efficiencies were averaged to ensure the validity and repeatability of the data. As a control device, the PSCs without any CIL film and any post-treatments (Al-only device) exhibited a PCE of 5.25% with a Voc of 0.88 V, a Jsc of 10.24 mA cm−2, and a FF of 58.3%. Because the solvent treatment could passivate the surface traps and increase the built-in voltage across the device,24 simultaneous improvements of Voc, Jsc and FF would be obtained in PSCs. Thus, the solvent-treated device was also fabricated, and a slight increase in Jsc and Voc was obtained, leading to a PCE of 5.45%. However, when a CIL was inserted between the active layer and the Al electrode, an obviously enhanced PCE would be achieved due to the simultaneously and remarkably improved Voc, Jsc and FF. PSCs with PBATD and TBATD as CILs showed enhanced PCEs of 6.98% and 7.26%, respectively. Especially, the TBATD modified device exhibited the highest PCE value of 7.26%, which was nearly 1.4 times that of the Al-only device. Most significantly, the Voc (0.93 V) for the TBATD modified device was among the top Voc values for single-junction PSCs based on PCDTBT:PC71BM so far. Although the Voc value obtained from PBATD was a little lower, it still showed a value of 0.92 V. This indicates that both CIL molecules in this study are promising CIL candidates to construct efficient PSCs.

The improvement of Voc should be mainly attributed to the decreased work functions (WFs) of the cathode after inserting CILs. Previous studies demonstrated that the introduction of CILs could increase the built-in potential of the PSCs through the surface dipole interaction between the pendant polar functionalities and the cathode,25 which can decrease the WF of the cathode. Variable approaches have been used to verify the formed dipole orientation after inserting the CILs with different polar functionalities.26 It is well known that using the water contact angle (θ) was a good way to study the interfacial dipole. The reduced contact angle would indicate an accumulation of an ionic component formed at the top of the organic surface after inserting the CILs.20 As shown in Fig. 5, the surfaces of pristine PCDTBT:PC71BM and solvent-treated PCDTBT:PC71BM were strongly hydrophobic with water contact angles (θ) of 98.6° and 97.8°, respectively. However, the water contact angles of CIL modified PCDTBT:PC71BM blend films were decreased dramatically to 73.8° for PBATD and 56.1° for TBATD. The results indicated that the hydrophobic nature of the pristine PCDTBT:PC71BM film had partially changed to hydrophilic nature after inserting the CILs. The TBATD modified film exhibited more hydrophilicity compared to the PBATD modified one. Therefore, TBATD may exhibit stronger interactions with the cathode and a more obvious decrease of the WF, leading to the lower energy barrier at the interface between the active layer and the cathode.

The change of the WF value can also be detected using ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) with mono chromatized HeI radiation at 21.22 eV. Fig. 6a presents the UPS spectra of bare Al, solvent-treated Al, PBATD modified Al and TBATD modified Al. The WF values, which were defined by the secondary electron cut-off in the UPS spectra, are 4.18 eV for bare Al which is in accordance with other reported results,14 3.54 eV for the solvent-treated Al, 3.35 eV for the PBATD modified Al and 3.20 eV for TBATD modified Al. Obviously, the decreased WF was in accordance with the increased Voc observed from the devices. Therefore, the UPS spectra could provide an explanation for the high Voc value achieved from the TBATD modified device and could also explain the slightly lower Voc value of the PBATD modified device.27

The J–V characteristics of all devices were measured in the dark to investigate the built-in potential (Vbi) of the devices. As shown in Fig. 4b, in the region from 0 to 2 V, the turn-on voltages were determined to be 0.98, 1.06, 0.99 and 1.06 V for the devices with bare Al, solvent-treated Al, PBATD/Al and TBATD/Al, respectively. This indicated that the built-in potential (Vbi) of the devices would increase, when the solvent treatment or CIL is introduced. On the other hand, the J–V curves in the dark could also be used for detecting the charge transport and collection properties of the devices. In the region from −1 to 0 V, the reverse currents of the PBATD and TBATD modified devices were greatly suppressed compared with the bare Al or solvent-treated Al. The suppressed dark currents indicated that the insertion of CILs could improve the charge selectivity and enhance the hole-blocking properties at the cathode interface. Thus, carrier transfer and collection could be improved, leading to the relatively high FFs.28
For PBATD and TBATD based devices, the high FFs were also supported by the measurement of series resistance (Rs). It is well known that Rs plays a significant role in the FF.28 A decreased Rs is essential for better ohmic contact, which can give rise to the FF.26d As listed in Table 2, the solvent-treatment could slightly decrease Rs, however, when a thin layer of CIL was inserted, the Rs of the device was significantly depressed. Especially, the TBATD modified device displayed the lowest Rs (5.5 Ω cm2), indicating that the optimum ohmic contact for charge transfer and extraction was achieved at the interface between the active layer and the cathode.
To check the discrepancy of Jsc, which easily leads to the overvalued PCEs, external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the corresponding devices were carried out and shown in Fig. 6b. Jsc values calculated from the EQE spectra were 10.02 mA cm−2 for the bare Al device, 10.08 mA cm−2 for the solvent treated Al device, 11.02 mA cm−2 for the PBATD/Al device and 11.08 mA cm−2 for the TBATD/Al device, respectively. The Jsc values integrated from the EQE spectra matched well with the tested values within 5% error, indicating that the Jsc data presented in Fig. 3a were not overvalued.
In order to confirm that the electron transport of PSCs was enhanced when PBATD or TBATD was inserted, electron mobility was measured using the space charge limited current (SCLC) technique with a device configuration of [ITO/Al/PCDTBT:PC71BM/with or without CIL/Al]. The J1/2–V curves of the electron-only devices are presented in Fig. 7. The electron mobility of the solvent-treated device (3.18 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) is almost the same as the bare Al device (2.57 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1). After inserting the CILs, the electron mobility became higher, and exhibited values of 8.65 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for PBATD and 1.05 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 for TBATD, respectively. Indeed, the incorporation of CILs increased the electron mobility, which was in accordance with the increasing trend of Jsc and FF as listed in Table 2.

The film formation at the top of the hydrophobic active layer is also an important characteristic of CIL materials. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was subsequently performed to study the surface morphologies of the films with or without CIL modifiers. The pristine PCDTBT:PC71BM film exhibited a smooth surface with a root mean square (RMS) roughness of 0.58 nm (Fig. 8a). After a solvent treatment, a smoother surface with an RMS roughness of 0.47 nm was achieved (Fig. 8b). The deposition of CILs on the active layer resulted in slightly rough surfaces with an RMS roughness of 0.64 nm and 0.90 nm for PBATD (Fig. 8c) and TBATD (Fig. 8d), respectively. This observation indicates that both PBATD and TBATD have good film-forming properties atop the active layer for efficient charge extraction in conventional architecture PSCs.

Inspired by these outstanding properties of the CILs, we further checked their performance in PTB7 (polythieno[3,4-b]-thiophene-co-benzodithiophene):PC71BM based devices. CILs with optimized thicknesses of 2 nm and 4 nm for PBATD and TBATD were employed. The J–V characteristics of the devices under 100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5G irradiation are presented in Fig. 9a, and the device parameters are summarized in Table 3. As we expected, the CIL-inserted devices exhibited enhanced Jsc, Voc and FF, and the PCE performance was obviously improved. It needs to be noticed that the Voc values were enhanced from 0.68 V to 0.76 V for the PBATD modified device and 0.77 V for the TBATD modified device, respectively, consistent with the PCDTBT:PC71BM system. The EQE spectra of the devices are shown in Fig. 9b. Jsc calculated from the EQE spectra agreed well with the tested values. These results demonstrated the universality of the two CILs for PSCs with different photoactive layers and verified again the great potential of PBATD and TBATD as CILs for future PSC applications.

Conclusions
In summary, two water/alcohol-soluble small molecular CILs based on the anthrathiadiazole-4,11-dione conjugated system were successfully synthesized and applied in conventional single-junction PSCs. The effect of CILs on the photovoltaic properties was studied in detail. A dramatic improvement in the device performance was achieved when the CILs were inserted between the PCDTBT:PC71BM active layer and the Al electrode. The CILs could effectively reduce the work function of the Al cathode, increase the built-in potential, and decrease the Rs of the relative PSCs. Compared to the device with PBATD as a CIL, the TBATD based one displayed a lower WF value, which was responsible for the larger Voc values. It has to be mentioned that the Voc (0.93 V) exhibited by the TBATD modified device is among the top values for devices that employed the same kind of active layer in conventional single-junction PSCs so far. The CILs reported in this work could amplify the Voc of the device and have a good film-forming property at the top of the hydrophobic surface suggesting that TBATD has bright prospects in future PSC applications.

All reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Co., Alfa Aesar Co. and Aladdin Co., and directly used without further purification. All reactions were performed under a N2 atmosphere, unless otherwise mentioned. 4,7-Dihydroxylbenzothiadiazole (BTO), 1,2-dibromo-4,5-bis(bromomethyl)benzene and 5-iodo-1,2,3-trihydroxybenzene (I-THB) were prepared according to previous reported procedures.22b,291H NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian Mercury 300 MHz spectrometer (Palo Alto, CA) or a Bruker Avance-500 spectrometer with tetramethylsilane as the internal standard. Elemental analyses were performed on a flash EA 1112 spectrometer (Germany). Mass spectra were recorded on a GC-MS spectrometer (ITQ1100, Thermo Fisher) or a Kratos AXIMA-CFR Kompact MALDI mass spectrometer with anthracene-1,8,9-triol as the matrix. UV-vis spectra were obtained on a Shimadzu UV-2550 spectrophotometer. Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) were performed on a TAQ500 thermogravimeter at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under nitrogen. Cyclic voltammetries were performed on a BAS 100W instrument with a scan rate of 100 mV s−1. A three-electrode configuration was used for the electrochemical measurement: a glassy carbon electrode as the working electrode, a platinum wire as the counter electrode and an Ag/Ag+ electrode as the reference electrode. A 0.1 M solution of tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF) in DMF was used as the supporting electrolyte. The detailed procedures of synthesis and characterization are presented as follows.
Synthesis


THBBr-ATD
          . 
To a 100 mL two-neck flask, Br-ATD (424 mg, 1 mmol), sodium bicarbonate (470 mg, 5.6 mmol), tetrabutyl ammonium bromide (20 mg), PBE-THBBr (1.78 g, 2.4 mmol), tetrahydrofuran (40 mL) and water (5 mL) were added. The mixture was degassed by a repeated procedure of freeze–pump–thaw and then Pd(PPh3)4 (23 mg, 0.02 mmol, 2%) was added. The mixture was refluxed for 12 h under a nitrogen atmosphere, then poured into water (200 mL) and extracted three times with ethyl acetate (3 × 75 mL).

Device fabrication and characterization
PCDTBT and PTB7 were purchased from 1-material Chemscitech Inc. (Canada), and PC71BM was purchased from American Dye Source (USA). The ITO-coated glass was pre-cleaned and treated with plasma for 7 min. A 35 nm PEDOT:PSS (Baytron PVP Al 4083) layer was spin coated and baked at 120 °C for 10 min. The device was then transferred to a nitrogen glove box. For the PCDTBT:PC71BM devices, a blend of 7 mg PCDTBT and 28 mg PC71BM was dissolved into 1 mL mixed solvent (chlorobenzene:o-dichlorobenzene = 1:3, v/v) and stirred overnight. The solution was spin-coated onto the substrate at 2000 rpm for 40 s and then annealed at 75 °C for 10 min. The thickness of the active layer was ca. 70 nm. For PTB7:PC71BM devices, the active layer was formed by spin-coating from a chlorobenzene:1,8-diiodoctane (97:3, v/v) solution consisting of 10 mg mL−1 PTB7 and 15 mg mL−1 PC71BM at 1000 rpm for 60 s and then dried under vacuum to remove the residual DIO. The thickness of the active layer was ca. 110 nm. The PBATD or TBATD cathode interlayer was subsequently deposited onto the active layer from the corresponding mixed solutions (methanol:trifluoroethanol = 1:4, v/v) at 2000 rpm for 40 s. The thickness was regulated by varying the concentrations from 0.2 to 1.6 mg mL−1. Finally, 100 nm Al was thermal-deposited under a pressure of 2 × 10−6 mbar. The device area was 0.04 cm2.
Photovoltaic performance of the device was measured under a 1 Sun, AM 1.5 full-spectrum solar simulator (Photo Emission Tech., model #SS50AAA-GB) with an irradiation intensity of 100 mW cm−2 calibrated with a standard silicon solar cell traced to the National Institute of Metrology, China. The current–voltage (J–V) characteristics under light and in darkness were measured using a Keithley 2400 source meter. A Q Test station (Crowntech Inc., Macungie, PA) was used to measure external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra under ambient conditions. AFM was carried out with an S II Nanonavi probe station 300 Hz (Seiko, Japan) directly on the surface of the fabricated devices in the DFM mode under ambient conditions. The AFM images and RMS values were drawn and calculated by the Nanonavi Analysis software.
The thicknesses of the PBATD and TBATD were estimated to be 30 and 30 nm, respectively, by spin-coating a 5 mg mL−1 solution of each molecule on the quartz substrate and testing on a profilometer (DEKTAK 150), and the results were the averaged values calculated based on the measurements of 5 films. The thicknesses of other films were estimated by an absorbance–thickness curve and it is assumed that the thickness is linear dependent on the maximum absorbance. In addition, the contact angles were measured on a commercial contact angle system (DatePhysics, OCA 20) at ambient temperature using a 4 μL water droplet as the indicator. UPS experiments were carried out using a UPS system equipped with a VG Scienta R3000 analyzer in an ultrahigh vacuum with a base pressure of 1 × 10−10 mbar.
The electron mobility of the devices was measured by using the SCLC (space charge limited current) method. The device structure was [ITO/Al/PCDTBT:PC71BM/with or without CIL/Al]. The mobility was calculated by the following equation:  
Here, J is the current density, εr is the dielectric constant of the material (assumed to be 3.9), ε0 is the permittivity of free space (8.8542 × 10−12 F m−1), μ is the zero-field mobility, d is the film thickness (around 70 nm in this work), and V is the voltage drop across the device, V = Vappl − Vr − Vbi. The voltage drop (Vr) due to contact resistance and series resistance across the electrodes and the built-in voltage of the device (Vbi) due to the difference in work function of the electrodes at both sides of the active layer are subtracted from experimental applied voltages (Vappl).
