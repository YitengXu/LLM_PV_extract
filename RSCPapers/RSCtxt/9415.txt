    , Accepted 26th April 2019First published on 26th April 2019AbstractHerein, we report the design, synthesis and characterization of a new series of simple donor–π spacer–acceptor/anchor (D–π–A) type diphenylamine based metal-free organic dyes possessing three different anchoring groups, viz. 4-aminobenzoic acid (DTP), 2-(4-nitrophenyl)acetonitrile (DTN), and barbituric acid (DTB), connected with 2-(thiophene-2-yl)-acetonitrile, as effective sensitizers and co-sensitizers in Dye Sensitized Solar Cells (DSSCs). They were subjected to photophysical, electrochemical and theoretical studies. The dyes exhibited characteristic λabs and λemi in the range of 445–485 and 545–570 nm, respectively. Both optical and electrochemical band gaps were found to be in the range of 2.2 to 2.35 eV. The driving forces for injection (ΔGinj), recombination (ΔGrec) and regeneration (ΔGreg) processes were evaluated to understand their feasibility. Finally, the DSSC devices were fabricated employing the new dyes as sensitizers as well as co-sensitizers along with the Ru(II) based N3 dye. Interestingly, DTP carrying 4-aminobenzoic acid as the anchoring group shows the best photoelectrochemical performance, viz. photovoltaic conversion efficiency (PCE) = 4.4%, open circuit potential (VOC) = 0.577 V, and short-circuit current density (JSC) = 9.06 mA cm−2 with a broad incident photon conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectrum. Co-sensitization of the dyes brought about enhanced VOC values, compared to the N3 dye alone. Finally, different interface resistance values obtained from the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) circuit fitting were used to study the fundamental processes of energy conversion.
Introduction
The quest for clean and sustainable energy to tackle the global energy crisis has led to the attraction of academic communities and industries towards the field of DSSCs.1–4 In DSSCs, a plethora of photo-physical sequences occur in the sensitizer, photoactive semiconductor and electrolyte, thus an efficient tuning is required for these major components to achieve the highest efficiency.5–9 In fact, desirable processes like dye injection (injection from the dye to the conduction band (CB) of TiO2) (−0.5 V vs. NHE) and dye regeneration (the reduction of the oxidized dye to the neutral state by accepting an electron from the redox couple) contribute effectively to the overall performance of the device.10 On the other hand, some unwanted processes such as recombination of the injected electrons in the CB of TiO2 by the oxidized dye (recombination) or I3− in the solution (dark current) that take place during the electron cycle bring about lowering of the JSC and VOC values.10 Consequently, a systematic approach is needed to tackle these issues and hence to design new sensitizers for improving the photoconversion efficiency.11,12
Further, the sensitizer is a crucial component in DSSCs, which is chemically adsorbed onto the semiconductor to harvest sunlight and then to produce an excited electron–hole pair.9,13–15 An ideal dye should have a highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level higher than the CB of TiO2 for the injection of electrons, whereas it should have a lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level lower than the redox potential of I3−/I− (0.4 V vs. NHE) favouring an easy dye regeneration process.10,16,17 In this regard, metal-free dyes are the most preferable candidates when compared to the Ru(II) based metal complexes, as they possess many advantages such as design versatility, cost-effective synthesis and superior molar extinction coefficients.10,16,18 Amongst the several approaches used for designing effective sensitizers, the D–π–A architecture, wherein a rigid structure contains electron donating and electron accepting units that are linked via a π-spacer, is known to be one of the most extensively explored simple designs to improve the photovoltaic performance of DSSCs. In these dyes, intra-molecular charge transfer (ICT) takes place conveniently from the electron rich donor to the anchoring unit through the π-spacer unit upon irradiation.14,19
Against this background, in the present systematic study, three new D–π–A architecture dyes, viz.DTP, DTN and DTB, as effective sensitizers/co-sensitizers for DSSCs have been designed. The schematic representation is shown in Fig. 1. In the new structural design, the diphenylamine scaffold was used as a donor system owing to its electron-rich properties, while 2-(thiophene-2-yl)-acetonitrile was incorporated as a π-spacer unit mainly due to its good conjugation, high polarizability, thermal stability and excellent charge transporting capability.18,20–25 In addition, 4-aminobenzoic acid (DTP), 2-(4-nitrophenyl)acetonitrile (DTN) and barbituric acid (DTB) were introduced as electron acceptors as well as anchoring units.26–31 Particularly, anchoring groups are vital as they enable light harvesting, intramolecular charge transfer, and interfacial charge transfer phenomena in the cell.15 Here, 4-aminobenzoic acid was selected as an anchoring unit because of its strong adsorbing property to TiO2 through carboxylic functionality. Further, 2-(4-nitrophenyl)acetonitrile and barbituric acid, containing no carboxylic acid group, were chosen because of the fact that they possess good electron accepting ability that facilitates an effective interaction with TiO2. Furthermore, one of the major drawbacks of the carboxylic acid group is its high recombination rate of electrons, which can be rectified to some extent by incorporating non-carboxylic acid groups. Thus, a thorough study on the effect of selected anchoring groups on the electronic processes involved in DSSCs is required.

The newly designed organic dyes have been synthesized from the simple diphenylamine by following a multi-step synthetic route. The target molecules and their intermediates were well-characterized using spectroscopic techniques. Their electronic properties and optical band gaps were calculated from absorption/emission studies. Further, the ground state oxidation potential (GSOP) and excited state oxidation potential (ESOP) values were calculated and the driving forces of the processes involved during energy conversion (ΔGinj, ΔGrec, and ΔGreg) were estimated from cyclic voltammetric (CV) studies. Furthermore, density functional theory (DFT) was used to map the ground/excited (HOMO/LUMO) electron distribution, electrostatic potential (ESP) distribution and density of states (DOS) using the Turbomole 7.2V software. Finally, they were employed in the fabrication of DSSCs as sensitizers to investigate their photovoltaic performance. Also, they were used as co-sensitizers along with the Ru(II) based N3 dye to study the effect of co-sensitization. The structure of the N3 dye is shown in Fig. 1. Their photovoltaic parameters, electron impedance data (RS, RCT, RPt) and anchoring strength were analysed in depth with respect to sensitization as well as co-sensitization behaviour.
Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization

Scheme 1 outlines the synthetic pathway of the newly designed dyes DTP, DTN and DTB. The requisite intermediates from 1 to 5 were synthesized by following well documented procedures with slight modifications.20,24 The required 4-(hexyl(phenyl)amino)benzaldehyde was obtained by the Vilsmeier–Hack reaction protocol. Further, (E)-2-(5-formylthiophene-2-yl)-3-(4-(hexyl(phenyl)amino)phenyl)acrylonitrile was prepared by following the Knoevenagel reaction. The final compounds DTP, DTN and DTB were obtained by subjecting the penultimate compound to Schiff base and Knoevenagel condensation reactions. The synthesized dyes were purified by either recrystallization or column chromatography techniques. The FT-IR, NMR, and mass spectra and corresponding characterization data of the dyes are given in the ESI,† Fig. S1–S14.

Theoretical studies
The electron delocalization in HOMO/LUMO levels, ESP maps and DOS of dyes were evaluated using the Turbomole software of the 7.2 software package.22,23,32 DFT simulations were performed via Becke's three-parameter hybrid functional and Lee–Yang–Parr's gradient-corrected correlation functional (B3LYP) using the def-TZVPP basis set. Fig. 2 shows the electronic cloud delocalization in the FMO levels. The 3-D view of the molecules shows clear charge delocalization in the ground and excited states, thereby indicating the effectiveness of ICT. As supported by their HOMO energy levels, the electron density is predominantly delocalized in the diphenylamine ring and the vinyl thiophene system of the dyes. However, at their LUMO levels, the electron cloud is clearly shifted from the electron donor to the electron acceptor units (4-aminobenzoic acid, 2-(4-nitrophenyl)acetonitrile and barbituric acid) to different extents because of their varied electron withdrawing nature. Further, it can be seen from Fig. 2 that the electron cloud is slightly away from the donor unit in the HOMO−1 level, whereas it is clearly concentrated on the donor and vinyl thiophene units in the HOMO level. Interestingly, DTN shows a complete shift of electron density to the anchoring group not in the LUMO level but in the LUMO+1 level. While in the case of DTB, the electron density is concentrated on the spacer unit and the anchoring moiety. Thus, it can be concluded that all the three dyes show a close proximity of their LUMO levels to the anchoring group facilitating the electronic coupling between the electron cloud at the LUMO level of the dye and the d orbitals of TiO2. The HOMO levels obtained for dyes DTP (−5.3 eV), DTN (−5.2 eV) and DTB (−5.5 eV) are sufficiently lower than the electrode potential of the redox couple (−4.8 eV) to facilitate the regeneration process.8 Likewise, the obtained LUMO levels of DTP (−2.6 eV), DTN (−3.1 eV) and DTB (−3.0 eV) clearly show that electron injection is also facilitated as the values are higher than the CB of TiO2 (−4.0 eV).33 The calculated band gaps of the dyes are in the order DTP (2.7 eV) > DTB (2.5 eV) > DTN (2.1 eV).

Fig. 3 shows the ESP maps of DTP, DTN and DTB on the iso-surface. Generally, ESP maps provide the distribution of the total charge of a molecule at a point in space around the molecule, which produces a net electrostatic effect.19,34,35 Further, ESP is associated with the total charge distribution including dipole moments, partial charges, electronegativity and the site of chemical reactivity of a molecule. The varying electrostatic potential values on the surface are represented by different colours, and the potential increases in the order blue > green > yellow > orange > red.34 As shown in the ESP maps of the dyes, electron density is concentrated on both CN and the anchoring groups. In DTP and DTB, it can be seen that the electron density is concentrated on the carbonyl group of the anchoring unit, while in the case of DTN, a clear electron density concentration on the nitro group is observed. An obvious shift of the electron density from the electro positive donor to the electro negative conjugation spacer and then to the anchoring group is noted. The ESP maps suggest that the electron distribution is favourable for the electron transfer from the donor to the anchoring unit.

The DOS plots of all the dyes are given in the ESI† (Fig. S15–S17). From the figure, it is clear that as the energy increases, the contribution of the s orbital has shifted to the p-orbital. Here, the p orbital contribution of the O and S atoms facilitates the binding of the dye with TiO2. All the three dyes show a similar pattern of DOS maps indicating that all of them meet the requisites of a good sensitizer.
Photophysical studies
The UV-vis absorption spectra of all the dyes were recorded in 10−5 M CHCl3 solution. Their corresponding spectral data are listed in Table 1 and the spectra are shown in Fig. 4. The absorption bands obtained in the studies are quite comparable with the reported dyes bearing a diphenyl amine core.24 Evidently, the spectra show two distinctive absorption maxima. The lower maxima lie in the region of 340–380 nm, which corresponds to the π–π* electronic excitation within the diphenylamine moiety. Whereas, the higher maximum is in the range of 440–485 nm, which corresponds to the promotion of an electron from the HOMO to LUMO and a little promotion from the HOMO−1 to LUMO.36 The obtained UV-vis spectra further confirm the ICT phenomenon, discussed in the section on theoretical study (Fig. 2).36 The observed λabs redshift of DTB (483 nm) compared to that of DTP (466 nm) and DTN (445 nm) is mainly due to the higher electron withdrawing nature of barbituric acid.9

To obtain a realistic picture of the light harvesting ability of the dyes, they were adsorbed on TiO2 and their UV-vis spectra were recorded in separate experiments. It was observed that the absorption peaks of the adsorbed dyes are red shifted and broadened (Fig. 3) because of the interaction of the anchoring group with the titania surface. Generally, when sensitizers anchor onto the mesoporous TiO2 surface, the resulting deprotonation and aggregation (H and J-aggregation) of dye molecules affect the optical absorption profile. Deprotonation and H-aggregation always result in a blue shift of the absorption peak, while J-aggregation mainly leads to a red shift of the absorption peak.37–40 All the dyes show a redshift, which can also be explained by the fact that the adsorption can lead to more delocalisation of the dye thereby decreasing the energy of the π* orbital.29,38DTP (531 nm) shows a greater redshift of ∼65 nm than DTN and DTB, thereby confirming the better ICT process. Further, all the absorption spectra show a markedly broad profile, indicating their good light-harvesting ability. Moreover, DTP shows more intense bands when compared to the other two dyes mainly due to the higher anchoring strength of the carboxylic group. Conclusively, DTP is a potential sensitizer from the view of its absorption behaviour.
The emission spectra of the dyes were recorded and the corresponding spectra are shown in Fig. 4. All the dyes show a characteristic λemi in the region of 545–570 nm. It can be seen that the λemi of DTB (546 nm) was blue shifted when compared to those of DTP (566 nm) and DTN (565 nm). The perceived blue shift is attributed to the presence of the strong electron withdrawing barbituric acid in the dye.33 Further, their optical band-gaps and Stokes shift values were calculated from the intersection between the normalized absorption and emission spectra. Their optical band gaps are in decreasing order: DTN (2.32 eV) > DTP (2.31 eV) > DTB (2.23 eV) and Stokes shifts are in increasing order: DTB (61 nm) < DTP (105 nm) < DTN (119 nm).
In order to study DTP's behaviour in acidic and basic media, its absorption spectra were recorded in the presence of a little trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) and triethylamine (TEA), separately, and the corresponding spectra are shown in Fig. 4. Usually, the acid group exists in equilibrium with deprotonated and normal forms. Here, DTP (677 nm) shows a bathochromic shift in the presence of TFA. The reason is that the TFA can protonate the carboxylate ion in the deprotonated form, which can move the equilibrium towards a more neutral form leading to a bathochromic shift of the dye. But, the addition of TEA results in a blue shift of DTP (255 nm), which is due to the deprotonation of the dye. Further, the behaviour of DTN and DTB in solvents with different polarities is given in the ESI† (Fig. S21 and S22). From this study, it can be concluded that the charge transfer between the donor and acceptor is very sensitive to the solvent conditions.39
Electrochemical studies
The cyclic voltammetric studies were performed to investigate the thermodynamics of electron movement from the excited states of the dyes to the CB of TiO2 and the dye regeneration from the redox couple in the electrolyte to the oxidised dyes. The observed results are shown in Fig. 5 and Table 1.
 Fig. 5  Schematic representation of the working principle of DSSCs with the calculated Eox and Eox* levels along with drifting energy values. 
The measurements were performed at room temperature with a conventional three-electrode configuration comprising a platinum disc as the passive electrode, glassy carbon (GC) as the working electrode, and Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode. The potentials were reported vs. ferrocene as the standard reference at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1 using 0.1 M tetra n-butyl ammonium hexafluorophosphate (n-Bu)4N+(PF6)− as the supporting electrolyte in acetonitrile under an argon atmosphere. From the voltammograms, it can be observed that all the dyes display two characteristic peaks, the first irreversible peak in the range of 0.6–0.7 V is due to the removal of an electron from the amine unit, and the second quasi-reversible peak, at about −1.6 to −1.7 V, arises from the reduction of the electron withdrawing anchoring group.41,42 The obtained voltammograms of all the dyes are given in the ESI† (Fig. S18). The experimental Eox (HOMO) values of the dyes DTP, DTN and DTB are 0.6 V, 0.64 V and 0.7 V, respectively. Their Eox* (LUMO) values as calculated from eqn (1) are −1.67 V, −1.66 V and −1.63 V, respectively. Further, it is noted that the HOMO level of the dyes is sufficiently lower than the redox energy of I3−/I− (0.4 V vs. NHE), thereby favouring the dye regeneration process. On the other hand, the calculated LUMO levels of the dyes are higher than the CB of TiO2 (−0.5 V vs. NHE); and this facilitates the electron injection phenomenon.33,43–45
From these studies, it is observed that DTB attained the lowest Eox and Eox* values, which is the result of the electron withdrawing nature of the barbituric acid. The presence of barbituric acid has lowered the LUMO level of the dye, making it closer to the CB of TiO2 and it has pushed the HOMO level close to the electrolyte potential.4,5 Eox* = Eox − E0–0(1)where E(0–0) is the excited state energy of the dye, which is evaluated from the intersection between the normalized absorption and emission spectra.
To study more precisely the feasibility of the dye injection, recombination and regeneration processes, the driving forces ΔGinj, ΔGrec and ΔGreg were calculated using eqn (2)–(4). The calculated values are given in Table 1. ΔGinj = Eox* − ECB(2) ΔGrec = ECB − Eox(3) (4)where ECB is the CB of TiO2 (−0.5 V vs. NHE) and  is the redox potential of the electrolyte (0.4 V vs. NHE).8 All the calculated ΔG values are negative, indicating that the aforementioned processes are thermodynamically favourable. As the values of ΔGinj and ΔGrec are very close to each other, the feasibility of losing energy through the recombination process is high. The dye DTN with ΔGinj = −1.16 eV and ΔGrec = −1.2 eV shows the predominance of the injection process. Whereas, DTB is susceptible to losing energy by the recombination process because of its higher ΔGrec (−1.17 eV,) and ΔGinj (−1.14 eV) values. Similarly, DTP with ΔGrec (−1.14 eV,) and ΔGinj (−1.1 eV) values follows the same trend.33 Further, the calculated ΔGregvalues of DTP, DTN and DTB are −0.24, −0.3 and −0.2 eV, respectively. From the results, it is clear that DTN has a more negative value of ΔGreg showing its spontaneity for dye regeneration. Generally, the dye should have sufficient driving force for its regeneration in order to prevent the recombination between the photo-oxidized dye and injected electrons, thereby causing a higher JSC value.46
Photovoltaic and electron impedance studies
The photoelectrochemical properties of the devices sensitized with DTP, DTN and DTB were determined to establish the impact of their anchoring group on solar cell performance. A detailed fabrication procedure is furnished in the enclosed ESI.† In the experiment, 0.3 mM dye solutions were prepared in 1:1:1 acetonitrile, tert-butanol and dimethyl sulfoxide solvent; co-absorbent chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA, 10 mM) was used in the dye solution, which acts as an anti-aggregation reagent. The dyes were adsorbed on the mesoporous TiO2 electrode in the presence of 10 mM CDCA co-adsorbent and measurements were performed using a standard Oriel solar simulator (AM 1.5 G, 100 mW cm−2) attached to a Keithley 2400 source meter.23,47 The characteristic J–V curves of the photovoltaic devices are given in Fig. 6 and the photovoltaic parameters such as VOC, JSC, fill factor (FF) and η are summarized in Table 2. The relation of different photovoltaic parameters is given in eqn (5). (5)where Pin is the power of incident light and A is the active surface area (0.18 cm2).13 The DSSC device with DTP showed a maximum PCE (η) value of 4.4% (JSC = 9.73 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.68 V, and FF = 66.99%) when compared to the devices with DTN (JSC = 0.488 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.45 V, and FF = 72.35%) and DTB (JSC = 64 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.47 V, and FF = 74.40%). It is interesting to note that the anchoring ability of 4-aminobenzoic acid is better than the majorly used cyano acetic acid reported earlier.24 Its higher JSC value can be attributed to its good anchoring properties with TiO2; accordingly, the electron injection to the semiconductor is facile when compared to DTB and DTN. Normally, a lower adsorption of the dye results in poor light harvesting ability, which further leads to a lower JSC value. JSC is related to IPCE according to eqn (6). (6)where IPCE(λ) is the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency at a fixed wavelength, e is the unit charge, and φph.AM1.5G(λ) is the corresponding photon flux of the solar radiation spectrum at a fixed wavelength.36 Experiments were carried out to obtain the IPCE spectra of the fabricated devices using a QEX10 spectral response measurement system. Fig. 6 shows the IPCE spectra and from the spectra, it is clear that DTP shows a broader IPCE spectrum than DTN and DTB. This can be attributed to the good adsorption of DTP on TiO2 through 4-aminobenzoic acid in comparison with DTN and DTB.48

Further, EIS studies were carried out on the devices sensitized with the new dyes to get a better understanding of the interfacial charge-transfer processes.49,50 Generally, electron flow in DSSCs is coupled with electronic and ionic transport. The driving force for the aforementioned transport is obtained due to the internal current generated in the device because of the different processes taking place in the dark and under illumination.51 The equivalent circuit shown in Fig. 7 was used to fit the EIS data and the obtained data are given in Table 2. For the sensitization of dyes, the capacitance Cμ and CPt in the equivalent circuit have been replaced with a constant phase element (CPE) since the electrodes have a rough surface.52 In the Nyquist plots shown in Fig. 7, the higher frequency intercept on the real axis of the semi-circle corresponds to the series ohmic resistance (RS), whereas the high-frequency region gives the interface capacitance (CPt) and charge transport resistance (RPt) at the counter electrode/electrolyte interface. Similarly, the low-frequency region provides the chemical capacitance (Cμ) and the charge recombination (RCT) resistance at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface.29,48,53
 Fig. 7  Electrochemical impedance spectra (a), Nyquist plots (b), and Bode plots for DTP, DTN and DTB sensitized devices and their co-sensitized devices with the N3 dye (c). 
In the present study, the RS value of DTP (20.01 Ω) and DTN (20.27 Ω) was found to be very similar but it is quite high for DTB (28.39 Ω) due to its high solvent resistance. Usually, the larger the RPt value, more difficult the transfer of the injected electron from TiO2 back to the electrolyte. This indicates the suppression of back recombination in the cell device.18 Thus, a larger RPt leads to an enhancement of VOC. Here, DTN (108.5 Ω) and DTB (325.1 Ω) show a very high RPt value, whereas DTP shows (23.42 Ω) a lower value. Even though the trends of RPt values are not in accordance with the obtained VOC values, they agree with the observed trend of ΔGreg values. The descending order of the RCT values obtained for the tested dyes is: DTN (628.1 Ω) > DTP (9.528 Ω) > DTB (6.4 Ω), which is in accordance with the calculated ΔGinj and ΔGrec values of the dyes. Although the dye DTN shows fairly good resistance, it has shown inferior cell performance because of its poor anchoring properties. Evidently, the dyes DTN and DTB give Nyquist plots with larger radii, which can be explained by the fast electron transport and long lifetime (τeff) of the electron in the film.52 This occurs if Rr (dark reaction impedance) ≫ Rd (diffusion impedance), where Nernst impedance comes into play. In contrast, if Rd ≫ Rr, Greischer impedance predominates, which can be seen in the case of DTP, where a small semi-circle is observed.52
The effective life time τeff of electrons in the CB of TiO2 was calculated for all the dyes using eqn (7) from the Bode plots shown in Fig. 7. τeff depends on the density of charge traps, which further contributes to the VOC value.41 (7)where f is the frequency of the corresponding peak in the Bode phase plot. The parameter τeff is related to the injection of an electron to the CB of TiO2 and can be explained using two widely used theories: (i) Marcus–Greischer theory, which states that the rate constants (or life-times) are proportional to the energetic overlap between TiO2 (e−) and the electron acceptors; (ii) the theory based on the trap-limited diffusion/recombination was applied to explain electron transport and recombination in DSSCs.13,38,54,55 It was observed that the calculated τeff values for the dyes are in the decreasing order of DTN (3.18 ms) > DTP (2.87 ms) > DTB (2.00 ms). In principle, a longer electron lifetime specifies better suppression of back reactions between the injected electrons and the electrolyte, which normally leads to the improvement of the VOC value.4 In the present study, the obtained τeff and VOC values are not in agreement with the theoretical data. The observed higher τeff can be explained with regard to the greater ΔGinj energy, but the poor adsorption properties of DTN resulted in poor performance of the cell. DTP with an τeff of 2.87 ms showed good performance of the device due to its good anchoring properties.
Co-sensitization studies
DSSCs were fabricated using DTP, DTN and DTB as co-sensitizers along with the well-known N3 dye and the detailed procedure is explained in the ESI.† The corresponding I–V curves obtained in the co-sensitization experiments are shown in Fig. 6 and their parameters are summarized in Table 2. The co-sensitized devices with DTP, i.e.N3 + DTP (η = 5.44% JSC = 14.25 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.62 V, and FF = 61.21%), and DTB, i.e.N3 + DTB (η = 5.43%, JSC = 13.13 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.61 V, and FF = 67.94%), showed a slightly higher PCE than the N3 dye alone (η = 5.39%, JSC = 14.39 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.60 V, and FF = 61.98%) whereas with DTNi.e., N3 + DTN (η = 5.32%, JSC = 14.63 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.66 V, and FF = 54.80%), it showed a lower PCE. It should be noted that all the co-sensitized devices showed an enhanced VOC value, which is due to the incorporation of the co-sensitizers in between the bulky N3 dye molecules resulting in the minimization of N3 dye aggregation and prevention of I3− ions from penetrating into the TiO2 surface. But, the IPCE spectrum of the N3 dye shows a broad spectrum from 300 to 800 nm with a maximum value of 72.966% at 535 nm. Its value dramatically decreases to 40% in the wavelength region of 350–400 nm due to the competitive light absorption between I3− and N3 dye. This competitive absorption can be reduced by a co-sensitization process that will result in a broad and intense IPCE spectrum. Thus, the broad IPCE spectrum shown by N3 + DTP and N3 + DTB is a result of the reduction of light absorption of I3−.38 The dye DTN along with N3 displays an IPCE spectrum similar to that of the N3 dye alone, which may be due to the improper adsorption of DTN in between the bulky N3 dye molecules because of the poor adsorbing properties of DTN. Also, the low PCE of N3 + DTN (5.32%) can be explained by the decreased FF (54.80%), which may have arisen due to the high RS value.19,34,35

Fig. 7 shows the Nyquist plots of DTP, DTN and DTB co-sensitized with the N3 dye. For all the co-sensitizers, the radius of the semicircles obtained is similar and there are two semicircles, unlike the sensitized dyes.56 The dye DTB shows a higher RS (29.19 Ω) but a lower JSC (13.13 mA cm−2) value than N3 alone; however, it still shows a higher PCE value. RCT observed for N3 + DTP (46.89 Ω) is greater than that of the N3 dye whereas the RS value (27.1 Ω) is similar to that of N3 (27.1 Ω). The RCT trend shown for the co-sensitized devices is in decreasing order: N3 + DTN (348.71 Ω) > N3 + DTP (32.07 Ω) > N3 + DTB (25.14 Ω). The RPt value for N3 + DTP is quite higher (46.89 Ω) than that of N3 (42.63 Ω) alone showing the efficient filling of the voids in between N3 molecules. Although N3 + DTN shows a lower RPt value (7.80 Ω), the VOC value has been enhanced to 0.66 V.
EIS Bode plots (Fig. 7) for N3, N3 + DTP, N3 + DTN and N3 + DTB exhibit two characteristic peaks; one at a higher frequency corresponding to the charge transfer at the Pt/electrolyte interface and another at a lower frequency conforming to the charge transfer at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface. These two peaks arise due to the difference in the local I3− concentration of the device. Under illumination, I3− is formed in the device (in situ) due to the dye regeneration at the TiO2/electrolyte interface. But, under the dark condition, I3− generates at the counter electrode and penetrates into the TiO2 film by diffusion.52,56 The characteristic peak appearing at lower frequency in the Bode plot is related to the charge recombination rate, and its reciprocal is associated with the electron lifetime.29 The τeff values were calculated using eqn (7) and they were found to be in decreasing order: N3 + DTN (6.49 ms) > N3 + DTB (4.39 ms) > N3 + DTP (3.18 ms).
Anchoring studies of the dyes on TiO2
The FTIR spectroscopy technique was used to gain an insight into the nature of the anchoring group and the mode of its interaction with TiO2. In this study, the FT-IR spectra of DTP, DTN and DTB adsorbed on TiO2 were recorded, and the acquired spectra of DTP are shown in Fig. 8 and the spectra of DTN and DTB are shown in the ESI† (Fig. S19 and S20).47 From the spectra, it is clear that DTP shows good adsorption on TiO2 whereas DTN and DTB show feeble adsorption spectra because of the poor adsorption properties of nitro and barbituric acid onto the TiO2 surface, respectively. Further, the feeble adsorption capacity of nitro and barbituric acid results in a very low concentration of the respective dye on the TiO2 surface. Deacon and Philips formulated certain rules to deduce the type of adsorption of the carboxylic acid group on the TiO2 surface.57 They correlated the difference (Δν) between symmetric (Δνs) and asymmetric (Δνas) stretching frequencies of a carbonyl bond of carboxylic acid functionality and the corresponding co-ordination type (Δν = Δνas(COO−) − Δνs(COO−)). Evidently, three scenarios are possible; if (Δν) of the dye adsorbed onto TiO2 (Δνabs) is smaller than that of the free molecule (Δνfree), i.e. (Δνabs) < (Δνfree), then a bidentate (either bridging or chelating) adsorption mode would be present; if (Δνabs) ⋘ (Δνfree), in all probability, a chelating mode would be present; if (Δνabs) > (Δνfree), then the dye molecule takes a monodentate binding mode.47
 Fig. 8  FTIR spectrum of DTP adsorbed on the TiO2 surface. 
From the spectra, it is clear that DTP shows good adsorption on TiO2 whereas DTN and DTB show feeble adsorption spectra. The dye DTP shows prominent bands at 1602 and 2211 cm−1 corresponding to the >CO and –CN stretching, respectively. The dye adsorbed on TiO2 clearly shows bands at 1654 and 1512 cm−1 for the asymmetric and symmetric stretching modes of the >CO group, specifying that the deprotonated carboxylic group is involved in the adsorption on TiO2. Further, the appearance of asymmetric and symmetric peaks reveals that the dye is chemisorbed, thereby ruling out the possibility of physisorption. The dye DTN shows a NO stretching band at around 1503 cm−1 and a CN stretching peak at about 2200 cm−1. After adsorbing on the TiO2 surface, feeble peaks corresponding to Δνas and Δνs of the –NO2 group are observed at around 1440 and 1320 cm−1, respectively, which are almost the same as those of the unadsorbed dye, probably due to the very weak interaction with the TiO2 surface.28 Further, DTB demonstrates a N–H stretching vibration band at 3171 cm−1 and a CN stretching peak at 2211 cm−1, while the adsorbed dye shows a weak peak at 2211 cm−1 due to the CN stretching with no N–H, and the CO stretching bands. In the FTIR spectra of all the dyes, the appearance of an O–H vibration peak may be due to the residual Ti(OH)2 present in the powder.26 Thus, it can be concluded that DTP has chemisorbed strongly on the TiO2 surface by means of bidentate chelation or a bridging rather than an ester linkage through the carboxylate unit.
Conclusions
In summary, we synthesised three simple D–π–A architectured dyes (DTP, DTN and DTB) as effective sensitizers/co-sensitizers in DSSCs. They comprise simple diphenylamine as the donor scaffold, 2-(thiophene-2-yl)-acetonitrile as a π-spacer unit and three varying anchoring units, i.e. 4-aminobenzoic acid, 2-(4-nitrophenyl)acetonitrile and barbituric acid. Among them, DTP demonstrates the highest PCE value of 4.4% (JSC = 9.73 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.68 V, and FF = 66.99%), due to the strong anchoring tendency of the dye on the TiO2 surface, as confirmed by its FTIR and UV-vis spectral studies. The observed high JSC value (9.73 mA cm−2) of DTP can be ascribed to its broad IPCE spectrum. Further, the prominent electronic charge separation from the donor to acceptor/anchoring group brings about efficient injection of excited electrons into the CB of TiO2, contributing to the high PCE value. In the case of DTN, the rate of injection is more than the recombination rate, as revealed by its CV (ΔGinj = −1.16 eV and ΔGrec − 1.2 eV) and EIS studies. However, it possesses poor adsorption onto the TiO2 surface, which led to poor performance. Upon co-sensitization, all the dyes exhibited enhanced VOC values, which can be explained on the basis of their ability to suppress the recombination process. The obtained results throw light on the importance of driving forces in various processes taking place during energy conversion as well as the resistances involved in interfacial charge transfer processes. Conclusively, the anchoring strength of the dye is a major efficiency determining factor in DSSCs.
