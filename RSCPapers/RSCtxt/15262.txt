    , Accepted 19th July 2015First published on 21st July 2015AbstractWe present a novel Sr-doped TiO2/SrTiO3 nanorod array heterostructure for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) via a facile two-step hydrothermal process, with a tunable microstructure, optical response and photoelectrical conversion properties. The chemical composition components and microstructures of Sr-doped TiO2/SrTiO3 nanorod array heterostructures are investigated using XRD, XPS, SEM and TEM characterization techniques, respectively. It is shown that the treatment of rutile TiO2 nanorod arrays in Sr(NO3)2 solution results in the self-doping of Sr into the lattice of TiO2 and formation of Sr-doped TiO2/SrTiO3 nanorod array heterostructures, inducing a transition of optical response properties from the ultraviolet region to the visible region. The photogenerated electrons and holes can be effectively separated due to the formation of SrTiO3/Sr-doped TiO2 heterostructures with a uniquely matched band-gap energy structure, resulting in greatly enhanced photoelectric conversion efficiency performance. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and photoluminescence results show that the formation of Sr-doped TiO2/SrTiO3 heterostructures can effectively prolong the charge carrier lifetime. The dye loading capacity on the Sr-doped TiO2/SrTiO3 heterostructures can be improved through the functionalization bonding of the hydroxide group on the surface of the electrode material. DSSCs based on the optimized Sr-doped TiO2/SrTiO3 heterostructure photoanode achieve the highest energy conversion efficiency of 4.70% (one sun illumination), nearly 1.5 times higher than the bare rutile TiO2 photoanode (3.10%).
1. Introduction
Since the great breakthrough in the photoelectric efficiency of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) was made by Graetzel and his collaborators in the 1990s,1 much attention has been focused on DSSCs, which are considered to be one of the most promising solutions to address the global energy and environmental pollution crisis.2 In the past decades, TiO2 has been extensively used as a photoanode material because its wide band gap can provide a large open-circuit voltage, good scattering properties and improved ability of incident light utilization.3,4 TiO2 has three kinds of phases, anatase, rutile, and brookite phases, among which anatase TiO2 is mostly used as photoanode material, since it is traditionally considered that there exists an inherently higher Fermi level for the anatase than that of the other phases, which may be favorable and preferable to achieve a lower recombination rate for light-induced electron–hole pairs and then a higher open-circuit voltage (VOC) for DSSCs.
However, as an instinct semiconductor, TiO2 suffers from low quantum efficiency due to the rapid recombination of photogenerated electron–hole pairs, which greatly degrades the photo-electrical conversion efficiency in DSSCs and hydrogen production efficiency in water splitting.5,6 Furthermore, another drawback of the TiO2 photocatalyst is its optical response only in the ultraviolet region, just a small portion of the total sunlight. These are challenging issues as they restrict the high photoelectric performance of TiO2 based materials.7,8 A great deal of efforts have been made to improve the carrier transportation by coupling it with other semiconductors, such as ZnO,9 SnO2,10 Cu2O,11 and CdS,12 in order to suppress the electron–hole recombination rates and modify the optical response performance. In addition, doping with various metal or nonmetal elements has also been proved to be an alternatively effective means to suppress the high recombination rate of photo-induced charges and tune the optical response performance.13–15
The widely used photoanode for DSSCs is usually based on the TiO2 nanostructured particles synthesized via a sol–gel process, and then the nanoparticle (NP) TiO2 layer film is spin-coated onto the FTO glass plates. The NP film always goes through high electron–hole recombination loss since the electron mobility in NP films is about two orders of magnitude lower than that of the single crystal due to the electron trapping/scattering at grain boundaries; the more grain boundaries in NP films may result in higher energy loss.16–19 Such an interface between the spinning-route fabricated TiO2 NP film and FTO substrate is inevitably not dense, and generally possesses a poor crystallinity, affecting the charge transfer kinetics at the photoanode interface, leading to low electron conductivity and photoelectrical conversion efficiency. To solve this problem, one-dimensional (1D) oriented TiO2 nanostructures, like nanowire- and nanorod-arrays, can be directly or in situ grown on the FTO substrate to improve the interface stability between the TiO2 layer and the FTO. Recently, it has been reported that the electron conductivity of rutile TiO2 nanowire-based DSSCs is more than two orders of magnitude higher than that of spin-coated TiO2 NP-based DSSCs.16,17 The dramatically increased electron transport rate for vertical rutile TiO2 nanorod arrays relative to nanoparticle-like TiO2 is presumably associated with the less grain boundaries in nanowire- and nanorod-arrays and more ordered electronic transmission along the oriented structure, and subsequently less energy loss. Some early studies proved that better crystallinity and vertically oriented TiO2 nanorods will result in less carrier recombination center and can obviously improve the dye loading, electron diffusion lifetime, and the photoelectric conversion efficiency of DSSCs.20 Interestingly, for 1D structures, rutile TiO2 can achieve an even higher VOC value and better electron conductivity than the anatase phase, which differs from the traditional view mentioned above. Furthermore, rutile TiO2 has been proved to exhibit additional advantages including better chemical stability, a higher refractive index and lower production costs than anatase.18
Due to the aforementioned good electron conductivity of rutile TiO2, 1D rutile TiO2 nanostructure arrays exhibit promising applications in solar cells,19,20 water splitting and photocatalysis;21–23however, the integral photoelectrical conversion performance of DSSCs based on 1D rutile TiO2 nanostructures is still not satisfactory.23,24 Perovskite-type oxides with a chemical stoichiometry of MTiO3 (M = Ca, Ba, Sr, Pb, etc.), as an important class of functional materials, have been widely investigated for ferroelectric, piezoelectric, and dielectric devices.24–26 In particular, strontium titanate (SrTiO3), with a unique cubic perovskite structure, has been found to be favorable and catalytically active in photoelectric conversion and water photosplitting because of its outstanding thermal stability and photostability, and excellent photocatalytic activity.27–30 Coupling SrTiO3 with TiO2 can effectively suppress the carrier recombination through the matched conduction band energy structure (type II cells).31,32 It is believed that the matched band structure of the heterostructure materials improves not only the electron transfer from the conduction band of SrTiO3 to that of TiO2, but also the hole transfer from the valence band of TiO2 to that of SrTiO3 through an in-built electric field. Currently, several types of SrTiO3/TiO2 heterostructures applied in photocatalytic, photo-water splitting, and dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have been reported. However, novel Sr-doped TiO2/SrTiO3 nanorod array heterostructures for DSSCs with a tunable microstructure, optical response performance and photoelectrical conversion properties are full of challenge and seldom reported.
Herein, we present a novel Sr-doped TiO2/SrTiO3 nanorod array heterostructure for greatly enhanced photoelectric conversion efficiency dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) via a facile two-step hydrothermal process. The self-doping of Sr into the lattice of TiO2 and the formation of the SrTiO3/Sr-doped TiO2 heterostructure induce a transition of the optical response from the ultraviolet region to the visible region. The dye loading capacity on the Sr-doped TiO2/SrTiO3 nanorod array heterostructures can be improved through the functionalization bonding of the hydroxide group on the surface of the electrode material and the carboxyl group of the dye molecule. The photogenerated charge carriers can be effectively separated due to the formation of the SrTiO3/Sr-doped TiO2 heterostructure with a uniquely matched bad gap energy structure, which can reduce the probability of recombination of electrons and holes, resulting in greatly enhanced photoelectric conversion efficiency. DSSCs based on Sr-doped TiO2/SrTiO3 nanorod array heterostructures can achieve the highest short-circuit current density of 8.42 mA cm−2 and a maximal photoelectric conversion efficiency of 4.70% under one sun illumination which are 1.31 and 1.51 times higher than those of pure TiO2 nanorods, respectively.
2. Experimental details
2.1 Preparation of Sr-doped TiO2/SrTiO3 nanorod heterostructure arrays

Synthesis of TiO2 nanorod arrays18,33. 
A typical rutile TiO2 nanorod array is prepared by a hydrothermal method. First, the FTO glass is cut into small squares (∼15 mm × ∼15 mm) and then cleaned by sonication with deionized water, acetone, and ethanol in turn with each process for 10 min. Sequentially, the cleaned substrates are placed in a Teflon-lined autoclave (80 ml capacity) with a solution of titanium isopropoxide (1.0 ml) in the mixture of hydrochloric acid (30 ml) and deionized water (30 ml). The vessel is then kept at 150 °C for 8 h. After a cooling process, the substrates are rinsed with deionized water and dried in air.


Preparation of Sr-doped TiO2/SrTiO3 nanorod heterostructures8,32,34. 
The substrates with TiO2 nanorod arrays are soaked in a solution with Sr2+ ions and converted to Sr-doped TiO2/SrTiO3 heterostructures by a further hydrothermal reaction. Typically, the obtained TiO2 nanorod array is transferred to a new 80 ml Teflon-lined autoclave, 40% filled with distilled water and 40% filled with NH4OH solution (26.0 wt%). Then Sr(NO3)2 powder is added to the autoclave and the concentration of Sr2+ is prepared in 5, 25, 50 and 75 mM, respectively (denoted as T1, T2, T3 and T4, respectively). For the bare rutile TiO2 sample, it is denoted as T0. The autoclave is placed in an electronic oven at 180 °C for 24 h. After the hydrothermal process is completed, the nanorod array is collected and sequentially washed with a 0.2 M diluted HCl aqueous solution, water, and ethanol to yield the Sr-doped TiO2/SrTiO3 nanowire array. Finally, samples are calcined at 600 °C for 30 min to remove the hydroxyl ions.


Hydroxylation treatment of the photoanode. 
The as-prepared samples are immersed into a mixture of deionized water, ammonium hydroxide and hydrogen peroxide (5/1/1, V1/V2/V3) and heated to 80 °C for different times. As treatment is over, the substrates are rinsed with deionized water and ethanol, and then dried at room temperature without any further annealing.

2.2 Solar cell fabrication

Fabrication of DSSCs. 
The prepared substrates are scratched into ∼0.3 cm × ∼0.3 cm pieces and immersed in an acetonitrile solution with 0.3 mM of dye N719 (cis-diisothiocyanato-bis(2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylato)ruthenium(II)bis (tetrabutylammonium)) overnight. The excessive N719 dye in the TiO2 and Sr-doped TiO2/SrTiO3 heterostructure film was rinsed off with anhydrous ethanol before assembly. The counter electrode is platinized by spraying H2PtCl6 solution onto the FTO glass and calcined in air at 410 °C for 20 min. It is then placed directly on the top of the dye-sensitized TiO2 and Sr-doped TiO2/SrTiO3 heterostructure films. The gap between the two electrodes is sealed by thermal adhesive films (Surlyn, Dupont). The electrolyte (electrolyte of 0.6 M 1-methy-3-propylimidazolium iodide (PMII), 0.05 M LiI, 0.05 M I2, and 0.5 M 4-tertbutylpyridine (TBP) in a (85/15, V1/V2) mixture of acetonitrile (Aladdin-reagent, China) and valeronitrile (Aladdin-reagent, China)) is filled from a hole made on the counter electrode, which is later sealed by a cover glass and thermal adhesive films.

2.3 Materials characterization
The microstructure of the species is characterized by XRD (Cu-Kα, 40 kV, 30 mA). All the samples are characterized in the 2θ range of 10–90°. The morphology and microstructure of samples are characterized by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, SU-70) equipped with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Tecnai 20U-Twin) coupled with selected area electron diffraction (SAED) is used to investigate the crystalline and microstructure details of the samples, operating at 200 kV. X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements of the material binding energy distributions are carried out using a Thermo Scientific ESCALAB250 spectrometer.
The UV-visible diffuse-reflectance spectra and the absorption spectrum are collected by UV-vis spectrophotometry (TU-1900). The dye uptake test is investigated using UV-vis spectroscopy (TU-1900) by desorbing the sample film membrane in 0.2 M NaOH water and ethanol (50/50, V1/V2) solution. Current–voltage measurements are performed under 1 sun illumination (AM 1.5, 100 mW cm−2) with a Newport solar simulator (Class 3A, 94023A) and a Keithley 2420 source meter equipped with a calibrated Si-reference cell (certified by NREL). The electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) are measured with a Princeton Parstate 2273A in a two-electrode design; the sample films served as a working electrode and the Pt-coated ITO or FTO glass as a counter electrode at an applied bias of the open circuit voltage under one-sun irradiation. The frequency range is from 10 mHz to 100 KHz; the magnitude of the alternating potential is 20 mV.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Structure and characterization

Fig. 1 depicts XRD patterns of different samples prepared in Sr(NO3)2 solution with different concentrations. As shown in Fig. 1a, the profile of the pure TiO2 sample (T0) without being treated in Sr(NO3)2 solution exhibits obvious diffraction peaks of TiO2 indexed to (101), (111), (210), (211), (002) and (112) planes of tetragonal rutile TiO2 (JCPDS No. 88-1175) after ignoring the background peaks of FTO. Interestingly, the relative intensity of the (002) plane becomes stronger, which should be ascribed to the highly [001] oriented growth of TiO2 nanorod arrays. This evidently demonstrates the successful deposition of rutile TiO2 nanorod arrays on the FTO substrate. Subsequent hydrothermal treatment of the as-prepared TiO2 nanorod arrays in Sr(NO3)2 solution is expected to form SrTiO3 on the surface of TiO2, and the corresponding XRD patterns are presented in Fig. 1a for T1, T2, T3 samples. It is shown that in addition to XRD peaks related to rutile TiO2, two XRD peaks at 23° and 33° positions are observed, which can be indexed to (100) and (110) planes of SrTiO3. Importantly, with the concentration of Sr(NO3)2 increasing, the intensity of (100) and (110) peaks related to SrTiO3 becomes stronger, indicating that the size and content of SrTiO3 increase. The XRD pattern of the magnified (002) peaks synthesized at different Sr(NO3)2 solutions is depicted in Fig. 1b. It should be noted that the (002) peak shifts to the position at a small angle with the Sr2+ incorporated content increasing, suggesting that the interlayer spacing of (002) gradually expands with the increase of Sr2+ concentration (Table 1). Considering that the radius of Sr2+ (0.215 Å) is larger than that of Ti4+ (0.145 Å), the lattice expansion can be attributed to the substitution of Ti4+ by Sr2+. The Sr doping into the lattice of TiO2 can be further confirmed by the following XPS examination, and the doping effect on the optical properties is also further analyzed.

The morphologies of pure TiO2 and Sr-doped TiO2/SrTiO3 heterostructure nanorod arrays are characterized by FESEM, as shown in Fig. 2. The top view FESEM image in Fig. 2a shows uniformly distributed nanorod arrays for pure TiO2 samples, with an average diameter of 150 nm for the TiO2 nanorods, exhibiting regular square tips resulting from the tetragonal structure of the rutile TiO2. The cross-sectional FESEM image (Fig. 2b) indicates that the nanorod arrays are nearly vertical to the FTO substrate with a thickness of 3.07 μm. After deposition of SrTiO3, the diameter of Sr-doped TiO2 nanorods becomes larger, and the cross-sectional square tips become less regular. Furthermore, in comparison with pure TiO2 nanorod arrays, the space between nanorods is mostly filled, evidently indicating the formation of SrTiO3 on the surface of Sr-doped TiO2 nanorods so as to form the Sr-doped TiO2/SrTiO3 nanorod heterostructure arrays (Fig. 2d).

The conversion from TiO2 to perovskite-type SrTiO3 during the hydrothermal reaction could be nominally expressed in a one-pot reaction. TiO2 + Sr2+ + OH− → SrTiO3 + H2O(1)
However, actually, it has been widely considered as a dissolution–precipitation process that involves the dissolution of titanium oxide followed by nucleation of the perovskite SrTiO3. The process can be divided into two steps: TiO2 + 2OH− + 2H2O → [Ti(OH)6]2−(2) Sr2+ + [Ti(OH)6]2− → SrTiO3 + 3H2O(3)
First, TiO2 is dissolved via the reaction with OH− to form [Ti(OH)6]2− (reaction 2), and then the as-formed [Ti(OH)6]2− reacts with Sr2+ to generate SrTiO3 that nucleates on the surface of TiO2 nanorods (reaction 3). It is noted that the dissolution of TiO2 and precipitation of SrTiO3 occur on the surface of TiO2 to form the Sr-doped TiO2/SrTiO3 nanorod heterostructure arrays.
To investigate the elemental distribution of Sr-doped TiO2/SrTiO3 heterostructures, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) mapping characterization is performed (T1 sample). As is shown in Fig. 3, it is implied that Ti, Sr, and O elements are homogeneously distributed among the area in Fig. 3a of the cross-sectional FESEM image of Sr-doped TiO2/SrTiO3 heterostructures.

The microstructures of the TiO2 nanorod (T0) and Sr-doped TiO2/SrTiO3 nanorod heterostructure (T1) are further revealed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), as shown in Fig. 4. According to the low magnification TEM image of the TiO2 nanorod sample in Fig. 4a, it is suggested that the products are composed of uniform nanorods with a diameter of around 150 nm, in accordance with the SEM results. Further insight into the microstructure of the TiO2 nanorods is revealed by the typical HRTEM lattice image (Fig. 4b). In Fig. 4b, the highlighted inter-spacing of 0.23 nm is in good agreement with that of the (200) plane of rutile TiO2. Fig. 4c shows a typical HRTEM lattice image of the SrTiO3/Sr-doped TiO2 nanorod heterostructure (T1) sample, and small nanoparticles on the surface of Sr-doped TiO2 nanorods can be revealed. The d-spacing of 0.27 nm corresponds well to that of the (110) plane of SrTiO3. A typical selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern is depicted in Fig. 4d (T1). The diffraction rings correspond well with those of (200), (002) and (112) planes of rutile TiO2, and (100), (110) planes of SrTiO3, respectively. It is clearly demonstrated that the heterostructure hybrid is composed of rutile Sr-doped TiO2 and cubic SrTiO3.

(d) Electron diffraction pattern from the Sr-doped TiO2/SrTiO3 heterostructure, the diffraction rings correspond to the (200), (002) and (112) planes of rutile TiO2, (100) and (110) plane of SrTiO3. 
More details about the chemical bonding state of the Sr-doped TiO2/SrTiO3 heterostructure (T1) are investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). From the fully scanned spectrum (Fig. 5a), the presence of Sr, Ti, O, C and Sn in the Sr-doped TiO2/SrTiO3 heterostructure is confirmed. The peak of element Sn is ascribed to the FTO substrate and the peak of C should be attributed to the carbon-based contaminant, and the binding energy for C 1s at 284.6 eV is used as the reference. According to Liu's work,33 the Ti related peaks of Ti 2p1/2 and Ti 2p3/2 at 464.2 eV and 458.5 eV should be derived from the TiO2 base, respectively. In this regard, two sets of different Ti 2p states can be fitted from Fig. 5b, they are Ti4+/TiO2 (Ti 2p1/2, 464.4 eV; Ti 2p3/2, 458.6 eV) and Ti4+/SrTiO3 (Ti 2p1/2, 463.5 eV; Ti 2p3/2, 457.8 eV). The asymmetry peak of Sr 3d5/2 around 134.0 eV can be assigned to SrTiO3 and SrO, and SrO is presumed to come from the Sr doping in the lattice of rutile TiO2 (Fig. 5c).35 Finally, the peak of O 1s (Fig. 5d) can be assigned to TiO2, SrTiO3, and SnO2 resulting from the F-doped SnO2 substrate as stated before.

3.2 The performance of solar cells
The optical properties of rutile TiO2 and Sr-doped TiO2/SrTiO3 heterostructure nanorod array samples are investigated via UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra. Fig. 6a shows the diffuse reflection spectra of the Sr-doped TiO2/SrTiO3 nanorod array heterostructure and pure TiO2 nanorod array. According to Guo's work,14 the Kubelka–Munk function is applied to convert the diffuse reflectance into the equivalent band gap energy. F(R∞) = (1 − R)2/(2R)(4)here R is the reflectance of the sample. Fig. 6b shows the plot of [F(R∞)hν]1/2vs. hν, in which linear segments are extended to intersect with the hν-axis to obtain the indirect band gap of the samples. The band gap of Sr-doped TiO2/SrTiO3 samples with different amounts of SrTiO3 is estimated to be 3.02, 2.93, 2.90 and 2.75 eV for T0, T1, T2 and T3 samples, respectively. Interestingly, the Sr-doping into the lattice of TiO2 and formation of Sr-doped TiO2/SrTiO3 heterostructure could create an impurity energy level, modify the optical response properties and narrow the band gap for a wide light absorption,31 which is attributed to the Sr-doped TiO2/SrTiO3 heterostructure and the self-doping effect due to the bonding character of Ti–O–Sr.36

As stated before, the dye adsorption capacity of 1D Sr-doped TiO2/SrTiO3 nanorod heterostructure arrays is an important factor influencing the photoelectric conversion efficiency of the DSSC devices. Previous studies show that the adsorption capacity of the N719 molecule on the working electrode can be improved through the functionalization bonding of the hydroxide group onto the surface of the electrode material and the carboxyl group of the dye molecule.37 Accordingly, a hydroxylation functionalization process is performed by soaking the samples in the mixture of deionized water and ammonium hydroxide to enhance the dye loading ability. The dye adsorption capacity test is carried out and the results are shown in Table 2. It is revealed from Table 2 that the amount of loading dye molecule within 60 min almost doubles compared with the untreated samples, demonstrating that the functionalization strategy here is effective to increase the dye loading capacity. The dye loading amount increases faster within 30 min, and then becomes gentle beyond 30 min, showing that at the beginning the bonding reaction between the hydroxide group and carboxyl group is active and subsequently tends to be saturated in a short time.

The J–V characteristics of the DSSC devices based on Sr-doped TiO2/SrTiO3 heterostructures and rutile TiO2 are recorded under 1 sun illumination (AM 1.5, 100 mW cm−2), as illustrated in Fig. 7. The solar cell parameters are summarized in Table 3. DSSCs based on rutile TiO2 nanorod arrays show a photoconversion efficiency (η) of 3.10%, with an open circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.78 V and a short current density (JSC) of 6.44 mA cm−2, respectively, and so the fill factor (FF) was calculated to be 65.9%. Comparatively, the DSSCs based on the T1 heterostructure sample displays a conversion efficiency of 4.70%, with JSC = 8.42 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.80 V, and FF = 75.5%. This indicates that the photoelectric conversion efficiency (η) of DSSCs based on the SrTiO3/Sr-doped TiO2 heterostructures can be greatly enhanced. As the concentration of Sr2+ increases for the SrTiO3/Sr-doped TiO2 heterostructures from T1 to T3, the photoelectric conversion efficiency of DSSCs does not increase all the way; the photoelectric conversion efficiency of DSSCs based on T2 and T3 samples is even lower than that of pristine TiO2 nanorod arrays. This might result from that, with too much SrTiO3 formed, the electronic conductive path along nanorods is gradually destroyed, or excessive SrTiO3 itself serves as the recombination center more than accelerates the carrier separation. Therefore, the quantity of SrTiO3 should be optimized carefully for high conversion efficiency.

As the carrier-recombination may cause a significant emission signal in the photoluminescence (PL) spectrum, the transfer behavior of the photogenerated electron–hole pairs can be evaluated. The PL emission spectrum is applied to investigate the separation and transfer process of charge carriers, as well as the trapping behavior of charge carriers. Fig. 8 shows the PL spectra of rutile TiO2 and Sr-doped TiO2/SrTiO3 heterostructures. It can be seen that after the heterostructure is formed, the intensity of PL peaks significantly decreases first, and with the further increasing concentration of Sr2+, the intensity of the PL peak augments gradually. The observed intensity decrement can be ascribed to the decreased recombination rate of photo-generated electron–hole pairs at a low concentration of Sr2+, indicating that the formation of Sr-doped TiO2/SrTiO3 heterostructures can apparently restrain the recombination of electron–hole pairs. However, further increasing the Sr2+ concentration may bring more defect sites (or recombination centers) and oxygen vacancies in the system and, TiO2 nanorod as a carrier transport pathway, the hierarchical structure may be damaged by too high doping-concentration of strontium, both of which will result in more recombination of photoinduced electron–hole pairs and relatively strong PL emission.31

To better understand the electrochemical characteristic of the samples, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is applied to describe the charge transfer kinetics at the photoanode interface, as shown in Fig. 8b. All three samples show two arcs in high frequency and low frequency regions. It is reported that the first arc implies the charge-transfer resistance of the electrode, and the diameter of the second arc implies the electron life time.38,39 Accordingly, the resistance of the electrode is about 3.4 (T0), 1.5 (T1) and 4.7 (T3) ohm, respectively, which proves that the Sr-doped TiO2/SrTiO3 heterostructures can effectively improve the charge transfer performance. More importantly, the diameter of the second arc is in the order of D1>D0>D3, demonstrating that the Sr-doped TiO2/SrTiO3 heterostructure can effectively prolong the charge carrier lifetime, but excess SrTiO3 may result in the counter effect.
The Sr-doping into the lattice of TiO2 could create an impurity energy level and narrow the band gap for a wide light absorption. The energy band diagram of DSSCs based on Sr-doped TiO2/SrTiO3 heterostructures is shown in Fig. 9. Due to the matched band gap energy structure between TiO2 and SrTiO3, the formation of Sr-doped TiO2/SrTiO3 heterostructures can effectively suppress the recombination rate of light-induced electrons and holes. The conduction band (CB) of SrTiO3 is located in a higher position than that of the rutile TiO2, while the valence band (VB) of SrTiO3 lies in a lower position than that of rutile TiO2.38,40,41 Therefore, the photoinduced electrons from the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the dye molecule will transfer to the CB of SrTiO3 and immediately transfer to the CB of TiO2, and also the photogenerated holes in TiO2 can effectively impregnate into the VB of SrTiO3. According to the diagram, if the SrTiO3 layer is too thick, the inputted electrons from dye will take a longer time to inject from SrTiO3 to TiO2, and this increases the recombination rate with the accumulative holes in the VB of SrTiO3. Herein, the experimental results agree well with the band gap energy structure. The formation of the Sr-doped TiO2/SrTiO3 heterostructure can effectively prolong the carrier lifetime and the best photoelectric conversion performance can be attained with a suitable SrTiO3 layer.

Compared with DSSCs based on conventional sol–gel route synthesized TiO2 nanoparticles (NPs), the DSSCs based on the nanoarray structure can avoid large electron–hole recombination loss. It is generally considered that the sol–gel route synthesized TiO2 nanoparticle film via the spin-coating process on the FTO contain more grain boundaries than the directly grown nanoarray structure. Due to the electron trapping/scattering at grain boundaries, the more grain boundaries in NP films may result in higher energy loss than that of the nanoarray structures. The energy loss in the nanoarray structure is about two orders of magnitude higher than that of the single crystal. Considering the above experimental results, the greatly enhanced power conversion efficiency of the DSSCs based on Sr-doped TiO2/SrTiO3 heterostructure photoanodes can be ascribed to the following three aspects. Firstly, the hydroxylation treatment exerts a profound influence on the capacity of dye adsorption, and a relatively high capacity of dye absorbing is in favor of higher photoelectric conversion efficiency. Secondly, the self-doping of Sr into the lattice of TiO2 and the formation of Sr-doped TiO2/SrTiO3 heterostructures induce the transition of the optical response from the ultraviolet region to the visible region with a better photo-response performance, which can be confirmed by UV-vis diffuse reflectance measurements. Thirdly, a uniquely matched bad gap energy structure for Sr-doped TiO2/SrTiO3 heterostructures can efficiently separate photogenerated charge carriers, and reduce the probability of recombination between electrons and holes, thus resulting in greatly enhanced photoelectric conversion efficiency.
4. Conclusion
In summary, we demonstrate a greatly enhanced photovoltaic performance of dye-sensitized solar cells based on Sr-doped TiO2/SrTiO3 nanorod array heterostructures. The self-doping of strontium into the lattice of TiO2 and the formation of SrTiO3/Sr-doped TiO2 heterostructure induce a transition of the optical response from the ultraviolet region to the visible region with a better photo-response performance. The dye loading capacity on the Sr-doped TiO2/SrTiO3 nanorod array heterostructures can be improved through the functionalization bonding of the hydroxide group on the surface of the electrode material and the carboxyl group of the dye molecule. The photogenerated charge carriers can be effectively separated due to the formation of Sr-doped TiO2/SrTiO3 heterostructures with a uniquely matched bad gap energy structure, and reduce the probability of recombination between electrons and holes, thus resulting in a greatly enhanced photoelectric conversion efficiency.
