Herein, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were employed to systematically explore the detailed reaction mechanism of CO conversion over the LaFeO3 oxygen carrier. It is found that the FeO2-terminated surface could exhibit better activity for CO adsorption than the LaO-terminated surface.

The oxygen diffusion process is easier to proceed on the LaO-terminated surface compared with the FeO2-terminated surface. Four pathways for the reaction process between the FeO2-terminated surface and CO were proposed and oxygen diffusion was determined as the rate-limiting step. For the reaction of CO with the LaO-terminated surface, one pathway was considered and CO2 desorption is the rate-limiting step. Comprehensively, the reactivity of CO conversion over the FeO2-terminated surface is superior to that over the LaO-terminated surface. We could control the CO conversion by regulating the oxygen activity of LaFeO3. This work provides guidance for the rational design of LaFeO3 oxygen carriers in the CL-SRM process.
1. Introduction
As a clean energy carrier, hydrogen is also one of the most important basic materials in the chemical industry. It can be used in the production of methanol and ammonia, Fischer–Tropsch synthesis and petroleum refining processes. At present, steam methane reforming (CH4 + H2O → CO + 3H2) is the main route for hydrogen production,1 while the synthesis gas has a high H2/CO ratio of 3, which is not optimal for the Fischer–Tropsch synthesis or methanol synthesis where a H2/CO ratio of 2.0 is expected. Therefore, downstream refinement is required to reduce the H2/CO ratio or to obtain pure hydrogen, leading to additional energy consumption. Chemical-looping steam methane reforming (CL-SMR) proposed on the basis of chemical looping combustion (CLC) offers an effective approach for the co-production of syngas with a suitable H2/CO ratio of 2.0 and pure hydrogen.2–5 In the CL-SMR process, methane is partially oxidized by metal oxides as oxygen carriers to obtain the syngas with an H2/CO ratio of 2.0 in a fuel reactor (FR), and then the reduced oxygen carriers are re-oxidized by steam to generate pure hydrogen in the steam reactor (SR). Generally, subsequent air oxidation of the oxygen carrier is required to fully recover its lattice oxygen in the air reactor (AR), thereby closing the looping cycle. The reaction of the oxygen carrier in the CL-SMR process involves the following three steps (eqn (1)–(3)) and the overall reaction is shown in eqn (4): Methane reduction: MxOy + CH4 → MxOy−δ1−δ2 + 2H2 + CO(1) Steam oxidation: MxOy−δ1−δ2 + H2O → MxOy−δ1 + H2(2) Air oxidation: MxOy−δ1 + O2 → MxOy(3) Overall reaction: CH4 + H2O + O2 → H2 + CO(4)
In the CL-SMR technology, the development of suitable oxygen carriers, which need to possess high oxygen storage capacity, sufficient oxygen transport ability, high redox reactivity, good thermal stability and excellent mechanical properties for continuous cycles at high temperatures and in the presence of H2O, is of great importance.6–8 Perovskite oxides with the general formula ABO3, where the A sites are usually occupied by rare-earth metal or alkaline earth metal cations and the B sites are occupied by transition metal cations, are a series of composite metal oxides. They could exhibit excellent redox properties, high oxygen mobility, and thermal stability due to their unique structural characteristics.9–11 Among various perovskites, LaFeO3 is attracting great attention as an oxygen carrier in the CL-SMR process. Dai et al.12,13 reported that the LaFeO3 perovskite is an attractive oxygen carrier for the partial oxidation of methane to CO and H2, which could be attributed to the large number of vacancies on the surface and high mobility of lattice oxygen in the bulk. Mihai et al.14 found that almost pure synthesis gas could be generated in the CL-SMR process using the LaFeO3 oxygen carrier by controlling the oxidation degree to adjust the coverage of the surface oxygen. Zheng et al.11 designed oxygen carriers from macroporous LaFeO3 supported CeO2, which exhibited high stability in continuous tests in terms of activity and structure. He et al.15 evaluated the performance of three-dimensionally ordered macroporous (3DOM) LaFeO3 and nano-LaFeO3 perovskite-type oxide oxygen carriers in the CL-SMR process and observed that methane was partially oxidized into syngas with a H2/CO ratio of around 2:1 over a wide range of reaction time. Recently, doping modification of the LaFeO3 oxygen carrier was also investigated to improve its performance. A family of perovskite-type oxides La1−xSrxFeO3 (x = 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, and 1.0) were studied and La0.7Sr0.3FeO3 exhibited better performance in the CL-SMR process.16 Wang et al.17 reported a highly selective and durable iron-based La0.6Sr0.4Fe0.8Al0.2O3−δ oxygen carrier for syngas production via a solar-driven thermochemical process. They also presented that A-site engineering of La1−xSrxFe0.8Al0.2O3 oxides significantly adjusts the oxygen capacity with CO selectivity maintained at above 94% for chemical looping methane-to-syngas conversion.18 Gong et al.19 observed that La0.5Ce0.5FeO3 achieves high stability with superior performance for syngas and hydrogen production in the CL-SMR process.
During the CL-SMR process, an H2/CO ratio of 2 is desirable. If the CO conversion reaction is excessive, the ratio of H2/CO will exceed 2. The CO conversion is expected to be controllable and a possible way to control the H2/CO ratio is to regulate the CO conversion. Consequently, a systematic investigation of the reaction mechanism of CO conversion is necessary and urgent to understand the key principles determining the CO conversion, which could provide theoretical guidance for the optimal design of LaFeO3 oxygen carriers. Although LaFeO3 oxygen carriers have been extensively studied through experiments, the detailed reaction mechanism of CO conversion is still unclear.
Density functional theory (DFT) calculations have been increasingly performed to explore the reaction mechanism of different oxygen carriers, such as NiO,4 Fe2O3,20,21 CuO,22 and Ca2Fe2O5.23 In this work, the reaction mechanism of CO conversion over the LaFeO3 oxygen carrier was studied based on DFT calculations. The CO adsorption behavior and oxidation reaction on the LaFeO3 surface were first examined. Then, the oxygen diffusion process in LaFeO3 was analyzed. Finally, the reaction network between LaFeO3 oxygen carriers and CO was summarized and we obtained the dominant pathway and the rate-limiting step.
2. Computational details
2.1. Computational methods
All DFT calculations were carried out using the CASTEP (Cambridge Sequential Total Energy Package).24,25 The electron exchange–correlation interactions were handled by the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) of the Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof (PBE).26,27 We applied the Ultrasoft pseudopotentials28 for the treatment of the ionic cores. A range of different cutoff energy values from 360 eV to 560 eV with an incremental step of 10 points was tested. It was found that the error between the step values was less than 0.02 eV when the cutoff energy reached 450 eV. Thus, the cutoff energy of 450 eV for the plane-wave was selected in this work. The Brillouin zone integration29 was calculated with a 6 × 4 × 6 and 3 × 3 × 1 Monkhorst–Pack k-point mesh for bulk and surface relaxation, respectively. The Hubbard U parameter (U = 4.3 eV) was introduced in the DFT+U calculations to correct the strong electron correlation in the localized Fe 3d states.30,31 Due to the magnetic properties of LaFeO3, the spin-polarized formalism was performed and the magnetic order of G-type antiferromagnetism (AFM) was arranged.30,31 The long rang dispersion correction has been made in our calculations. The convergence criteria for structural optimization were as follows: 2.0 × 10−5 eV per atom for total energy, 2.0 × 10−6 eV per atom for a self-consistent field (SCF), 0.05 eV Å−1 for force and 0.002 Å for displacement.
It was reported that bulk LaFeO3 corresponding to the experimental structure crystallizes with an orthorhombic perovskite-type in the Pnma (62) space group, as illustrated in Fig. 1a. The optimized bulk lattice parameters are a = 5.475 Å, b = 7.817 Å and c = 5.449 Å, which agree well with the experimentally reported values (a = 5.560 Å, b = 7.850 Å and c = 5.551 Å).32 It was found that the crystal structure of perovskites exhibits a pseudocubic symmetry at high reaction temperatures (700–1200 K).33 Therefore, a pseudocubic 2 × 2 × 2 supercell containing 40 atoms was constructed as shown in Fig. 1b. The structural optimization of the CO and CO2 molecules was performed in a 20 Å cubic unit cell. The calculated bond lengths of CO (1.153 Å) and CO2 (1.181 Å) are consistent with the experimental values (1.128 Å and 1.162 Å)34 and previously calculated values (1.140 Å35 and 1.193 Å36).

2.2. Model development
The LaFeO3(010) surface was considered to be the most stable adsorption surface37 and used to explore the reaction mechanism of CO conversion over the LaFeO3 oxygen carrier. It could expose two terminations, namely FeO2- and LaO-terminated surfaces. The nine-layer periodic slabs were constructed based on the LaFeO3 pseudocubic cell in Fig. 1b to model FeO2- and LaO-terminated LaFeO3(010) surfaces, as shown in Fig. 1c and d. To ensure negligible interaction between periodic slabs, a 15 Å thick vacuum region was introduced. The top four layers were relaxed, while the remaining five layers were fixed. The adsorption energy (Eads) is calculated as follows: Eads= ECO/slab− Eslab− ECO(5)
In the above formula, Eslab represents the total energy of the LaFeO3(001) surface slab, and ECO/slab and ECO are the total energies of a surface slab with an adsorbed CO and a CO molecule, respectively. According to this definition, the larger negative Eads value suggests the stronger adsorption strength. Based on the complete linear/quadratic synchronous transit (LST/QST) method,38 we obtained the transition state (TS) of each elementary reaction. In the TS search, the convergence threshold of root-mean-square (RMS) force acting on the atom was kept at 0.25 eV Å−1. The TS was confirmed based on the Nudged-Elastic Band (NEB) algorithm. The energy barrier (Eb) and reaction energy (ΔH) are defined using the equations: Eb = ETS − EIS(6) ΔH = EFS − EIS(7)where EIS, ETS and EFS are the energies of the initial state (IS), the transition state (TS) and the final state (FS) of each elementary step, respectively.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. CO adsorption on the LaFeO3(010) surface
The CO oxidation reaction over the LaFe2O3 oxygen carrier starts with CO adsorption on the surface. Therefore, we first studied the CO adsorption behavior on FeO2- and LaO-terminated LaFeO3(010) surfaces. As shown in Fig. 1c, six adsorption sites including Fe-top, O1-top, O2-top, Fe–O1 bridge, Fe–O2 bridge and hollow sites are exposed for the FeO2-terminated surface.39,40 For the LaO-terminated surface in Fig. 1d, three adsorption sites (O-top, La-top and La–O bridge sites) were examined.41 In addition, we considered two orientations of the CO molecule (parallel and perpendicular).
The optimized structures of CO adsorption on the FeO2-terminated LaFeO3(010) surface are presented in Fig. 2 and Table 1 summarizes the corresponding adsorption energies, structural parameters, and Mulliken charge. For the CO adsorption on hollow, O1-top and O2-top sites, the adsorption energies are −0.06, −0.07 and −0.09 eV, respectively. In addition, the charge transfer between the surface and the CO molecule is negligible. Therefore, the CO adsorption on these three sites is unstable and it is a weak physisorption process. However, the CO adsorption on Fe-top, Fe–O1 bridge and Fe–O2 bridge sites, corresponding to the 1A, 1B and 1C configurations in Fig. 2, is a stable and strong chemisorption process. In the configuration of 1A, the CO molecule strongly binds to the Fe site in a perpendicular adsorption way with the C–Fe bond of 1.792 Å. It tends to adsorb on the Fe–O1 bridge and Fe–O2 bridge sites in the configurations of 1B and 1C, forming a bridged connection O–C–Fe structure. The C atom of CO is coordinated with surface O and Fe atoms, forming two C–O and C–Fe bonds. The C–O and C–Fe bond lengths in 1B (1C) configuration are 1.293 (1.312) Å and 1.939 (1.924) Å, respectively. The adsorption energies of 1A, 1B and 1C are calculated to be −1.58, −1.65 and −1.72 eV, respectively, corresponding to −0.11, −0.12 and −0.12 e charge transfer. Therefore, the CO adsorption on the FeO2-terminated surface is a chemisorption process.

As shown in Fig. 3 and Table 1, the optimized structures, adsorption energies, structural parameters and Mulliken charge for CO adsorption on the LaO-terminated LaFeO3(010) surface were obtained. We could see that the CO adsorption strength increases in the following order: 2B (−0.20 eV) < 2A (−0.38 eV) < 2C (−0.43 eV), and the distance between CO and the surface is more than 2.400 Å. Meanwhile, the CO molecule acts as an electron acceptor, and the charges of 0.07 (2B), 0.09 (2A) and 0.10 e (2C) are transferred from the LaO-terminated surface to it, respectively. It could be concluded that the CO molecule is weakly adsorbed on the LaO-terminated LaFeO3(010) surface. Among the three configurations, the adsorption configuration (2C) of the Fe–O bridge site is the most stable.

Based on the above analysis, we could see that the CO molecule is more likely to be adsorbed on a FeO2-terminated surface compared to a LaO-terminated surface, indicating that the FeO2-terminated LaFeO3(010) surface could exhibit better activity for CO adsorption. Similar phenomena were observed for H2 molecules by Chen and co-workers. It is reported that the H2 adsorption performance of the FeO2-terminated surface is better than that of the LaO-terminated surface.37 Moreover, we found that the preferential adsorption sites on the LaFeO3(010) surface are Fe-top, Fe–O1 and Fe–O2 bridge sites, which agrees well with the experimental results that the catalytic activity of perovskite compounds is basically controlled by the B-site metal.42–44
3.2. CO oxidation on the LaFeO3(010) surface
After the CO molecule is adsorbed on the surface of the LaFeO3 oxygen carrier, it will be oxidized by surface oxygen to form a CO2 molecule. Therefore, the CO oxidation reaction on the LaFeO3(010) surface was investigated. Fig. 4 and 5 present the reaction pathways and energy profiles for CO oxidation on FeO2- and LaO-terminated LaFeO3(010) surfaces.
 Fig. 4  The reaction pathways and energy profiles for CO oxidation on the FeO2-terminated LaFeO3(010) surface. 
 Fig. 5  The reaction pathways and energy profiles for CO oxidation on the LaO-terminated LaFeO3(010) surface. 
As shown in Fig. 4, four reaction pathways (paths 1–4) were proposed for the CO oxidation on the FeO2-terminated surface. In four paths, paths 1 and 2 contain two elementary steps: CO adsorption (IS → 1B/1C) and CO2 desorption (1B/1C → TS1/TS2 → FS1/FS2), while three elementary steps, including CO adsorption (IS → 1A), CO diffusion (IA → TS3/TS4 → 1B/1C) and CO2 desorption (1B/1C → TS1/TS2 → FS1/FS2), are involved for paths 3 and 4. For paths 1 and 2, gaseous CO molecules are first chemically adsorbed on the Fe–O1 bridge (1B) and Fe–O2 bridge (1C) sites, forming the COO* species. This step is a strongly exothermic process with the reaction energies of −1.65 eV for path 1 and −1.72 eV for path 2. Subsequently, the COO* species detach from the surface to generate free CO2 molecules through transition states TS1 and TS2, which corresponds to the CO2 desorption process. In TS1 and TS2 configurations, the surface oxygen is pulled out and the C–Fe distance is stretched from 1.939 Å (1B)/1.924 Å (1C) to 2.764 Å (TS1)/2.824 Å (TS2). The calculated energy barriers for this step are 0.48 eV for path 1 and 0.45 eV for path 2, which is a slightly exothermic process. For paths 3 and 4, gaseous CO molecules are first chemically adsorbed on the Fe-top site with a reaction energy of −1.58 eV and then migrates to the Fe–O1 bridge (TS3) and Fe–O2 bridge (TS4) sites. This step needs to overcome the energy barriers of 0.72 eV for path 3 and 0.61 eV for path 4 with the reaction energies of −0.07 eV and −0.14 eV, respectively. Finally, the CO2 desorption process is performed through TS1 and TS2, which are the same as paths 1 and 2. Obviously, the energy barrier of CO diffusion is higher than that of CO2 desorption, indicating that it is the rate-limiting step of paths 3 and 4.
For the LaO-terminated surface, we considered one reaction pathway for CO oxidation, as shown in Fig. 5. This pathway involves three elementary steps: CO adsorption (IS → 2C), CO diffusion (2C → TS1 → IM) and CO2 desorption (IM → TS2 → FS). In the initial step, the CO molecule is weakly adsorbed on the Fe–O bridge site with a reaction energy of −0.43 eV. Then, the adsorbed CO diffuses to the neighboring oxygen through TS1 and bonds with it to form the COO* species (IM). At TS1, the distance between C and O is decreased from 2.499 Å to 2.035 Å. This step is an exothermic process with a reaction energy of −0.35 eV and the calculated energy barrier is 0.24 eV. The last step is the CO2 desorption via TS2 by overcoming an energy barrier of 1.82 eV with the reaction energy of 1.67 eV and TS2 presents the release of COO* species from the surface. We could find that the energy barrier and reaction energy of CO2 desorption are much higher than CO diffusion, indicating that CO2 desorption is the rate-limiting step.
According to our DFT calculations, we could find that the energy barrier and reaction energy of CO oxidation on the FeO2-terminated surface are much lower than those on the LaO-terminated surface. In addition, the energy barriers for paths 1 and 2 of the FeO2-terminated surface are even lower than 0.5 eV, indicating that the CO oxidation reaction is prone to occur, and surface oxygen exhibits high activity. Therefore, we could conclude that the FeO2-terminated surface is kinetically and thermodynamically more favorable for CO oxidation reaction than the LaO-terminated surface, and the Fe–O site is the main active site. It is suggested that the transformation of Fe3+ → Fe2+/Fe0 is preferred and easy to proceed, while La3+ is very difficult to be reduced. The experimental studies14,15,45 also showed that the reduction of LaFeO3 is mainly reflected in the reduction from Fe3+ to Fe2+ or metallic Fe, which is in good agreement with our findings. Mihai et al.14 also reported that the reduction reaction of LaFeO3 oxygen carriers is based on the active sites of Fe associated with the surface oxygen, which further confirms our DFT calculations.
3.3. Oxygen diffusion in LaFeO3
As the surface oxygen is consumed after the CO oxidation reaction, oxygen vacancies will occur on the surface of the oxygen carrier. The lattice oxygen in the inner layer will diffuse to the surface to fill the oxygen vacancies and continue to participate in the reaction. In order to deeply reveal the reaction mechanism of the LaFeO3 oxygen carrier with CO fuel, the diffusion of oxygen anion from the inner layer to the surface through bulk solid phases was studied. Fig. 6 and 7 show the oxygen diffusion pathways and energy profiles for FeO2- and LaO-terminated LaFeO3(010) surfaces.
 Fig. 6  The oxygen diffusion pathways and energy profiles for the FeO2-terminated LaFeO3(010) surface. 
 Fig. 7  The oxygen diffusion pathways and energy profiles for the LaO-terminated LaFeO3(010) surface. 
The FeO2-terminated LaFeO3(010) surface can generate two different kinds of surface oxygen (O1 and O2) vacancies denoted as VO(1) and VO(2) with the CO oxidation reaction, respectively. We could see from Fig. 6 that the formation energy of the VO(1) site is 1.57 eV, which is higher than the formation energy of the VO(2) site (1.50 eV), indicating that oxygen vacancies preferentially occupy the VO(2) site. This is in good agreement with the calculation results of the CO oxidation reaction. Compared with surface O1, CO is more likely to react with surface O2 to form CO2 due to its lower energy barrier, which makes it easier to form oxygen vacancies at the O2 sites. Then, we studied two pathways for oxygen diffusion, namely the migration of oxygen ions in the second layer to occupy the VO(1) site for path a and the VO(2) site for path b. The related calculated results and the configurations of IS, TS, and FS are illustrated in Fig. 6. Two pathways are strong endothermic processes with reaction energies of 0.78 eV (path a) and 0.85 eV (path b). Path a needs to overcome the energy barrier of 1.43 eV, which is higher than that of path b (1.35 eV), suggesting that the migration rate of oxygen ions through path b is faster than that through path a.
We could see from Fig. 7 that the formation energy of surface oxygen vacancy denoted as VO of the LaO-terminated LaFeO3(010) surface is 4.47 eV, which is much higher than that of the FeO2-terminated LaFeO3(010) surface. Therefore, the formation of oxygen vacancy on the LaO-terminated surface is much more difficult than that on the FeO2-terminated surface. Fig. 7 shows the related calculated results, and the configurations of IS, TS, and FS for oxygen diffusion of the LaO-terminated surface. The calculated energy barrier of this process is 0.85 eV and it is exothermic with a reaction energy of −0.51 eV, indicating it is favorable thermodynamically.
Based on the above analysis, the oxygen diffusion process for a LaO-terminated surface requires a lower energy barrier compared with a FeO2-terminated surface, implying that the oxygen diffusion process of a LaO-terminated surface is easier to proceed. Moreover, the energy barriers of FeO2- and LaO-terminated surfaces are higher than 0.80 eV, implying that oxygen diffusion in LaFeO3 occurs under high temperature conditions.
3.4. Reaction network of LaFeO3 oxygen carriers with CO
According to our DFT calculations, the reaction network between CO and the LaFeO3 oxygen carrier, including FeO2- and LaO-terminated LaFeO3(010) surfaces, is summarized and schematically represented in Fig. 8. By comparing the energy barriers and reaction energies, the dominant pathway and the rate-limiting step were obtained. The reaction of the FeO2-terminated surface with CO can proceed through four paths (paths 1–4), as illustrated in Fig. 8. The oxygen diffusion process was determined as the rate-limiting step of each path because this step needs to overcome the highest energy barrier. In four paths, path 2 requires fewer elementary steps and a lower energy barrier compared with the other three paths, indicating that path 2 is the dominant pathway. For CO reaction with a LaO-terminated surface, one pathway was proposed and the rate-limiting step is the CO2 desorption process. The rate-limiting step for the dominant pathway of the FeO2-terminated surface requires a lower energy barrier than the LaO-terminated surface. In addition, the energy barriers of CO oxidation and oxygen diffusion for the LaO-terminated surface are both high. Comprehensively, the reactivity of CO conversion over a FeO2-terminated surface is superior to that over a LaO-terminated surface.
 Fig. 8  Schematic reaction network of LaFeO3 oxygen carriers with CO. +CO represents the CO adsorption, and the corresponding value represents the adsorption energy. Energy barrier and reaction energy (in parentheses) are labeled for each elementary step. Red label represents the rate-limiting step and the blue arrow represents the dominant pathway for the entire reaction between CO and FeO2-terminated surface. 
Based on our calculation, the energy barrier of the rate-limiting step for the CO conversion reaction over the FeO2-terminated surface and LaO-terminated surface is high, indicating that the LaFeO3 oxygen carrier could suppress the CO over-conversion process, which revealed the inherent mechanism of the outstanding CO selectivity of LaFeO3. More importantly, oxygen diffusion is found to be the key parameter to tune the CO conversion of the FeO2-terminated LaFeO3, while surface oxygen activity dominates the CO conversion of the LaO-terminated LaFeO3. Therefore, the CO conversion over the LaFeO3 oxygen carrier can be controlled by manipulating oxygen activity. A poorer oxygen activity is beneficial to a higher selectivity to CO, while a better oxygen activity is beneficial to methane oxidation. There is thus optimal oxygen activity for the CO conversion over the LaFeO3 oxygen carrier. For the LaFeO3 perovskite, the oxygen activity could be regulated by partial substitution of A/B sites to improve the CO selectivity, which has been reported by previous experimental studies.16,18,19 The computational selection for suitable A/B site dopants could be employed to dramatically accelerate the identification of high-performance LaFeO3 oxygen carriers. Our work provides guidance for the rational design of the LaFeO3 oxygen carrier in the CL-SRM process.
4. Conclusions
The detailed reaction mechanism of CO conversion over the LaFeO3 oxygen carrier was systematically studied by using DFT calculations in this work. The CO adsorption behavior on FeO2- and LaO-terminated LaFeO3(010) surfaces was first studied. It is observed that the FeO2-terminated surface could exhibit better activity for CO adsorption. Then, the CO oxidation reaction on FeO2- and LaO-terminated surfaces was studied. We found that the energy barrier of CO oxidation on the FeO2-terminated surface is much lower than that on the LaO-terminated surface, implying that the FeO2-terminated surface is much more favorable for CO oxidation. The oxygen diffusion process in LaFeO3 was also analyzed. Our calculation results showed that a lower energy barrier of the oxygen diffusion process is required for the LaO-terminated surface compared with the FeO2-terminated surface, suggesting that the oxygen diffusion process of the LaO-terminated surface is easier to proceed. Moreover, oxygen diffusion in LaFeO3 is an inherently high-temperature process. Finally, the reaction network between the LaFeO3 oxygen carrier and CO fuel was summarized. Comprehensively, the reactivity of CO conversion over a FeO2-terminated surface is superior to that over a LaO-terminated surface. We could control the CO conversion by regulating the oxygen activity of LaFeO3. This work illustrates the detailed reaction mechanism of the CO conversion over LaFeO3 oxygen carriers. These results also pave the way for the informed design of high-performance LaFeO3 oxygen carriers in the CL-SRM process. In future work, we will perform microkinetic simulations to further understand the reaction mechanism of the LaFeO3 oxygen carrier.
