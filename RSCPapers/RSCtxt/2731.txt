    , Accepted 28th August 2015First published on 2nd September 2015AbstractHydrogenated TiO2/MnOx nanowires (NWs) with a diameter of 50–80 nm and a length of 0.5–0.8 μm supported on carbon cloth have been successfully prepared. The entire surface of the H–TiO2 NWs is covered uniformly by amorphous MnOx with an average thickness of 7.0 nm. The H–TiO2 NWs are poorly active for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the MnOx as a major potential feasible electrocatalyst shows a considerable activity. The onset potential shifts negatively and the current density improves not only by the enlarged surface area of the MnOx support on the H–TiO2 NWs, but also by a synergistic effect between TiO2 and MnOx. The presence of three manganese oxides with different valences such as MnO, Mn2O3 and MnO2 in the H–TiO2/MnOx NWs is apt to effect the OER due to electron transfer. The percentage of Mn2+ increases and the percentages of Mn3+ and Mn4+ decrease after the test, which proves the assumption that Mn4+ is first reduced to Mn3+ by electron injection from H2O, and then Mn3+ is further reduced to Mn2+ when the O2 evolution occurs during the OER in alkaline media at pH ≥ 9.
Introduction
The demand for renewable energy sources, which are environmentally friendly, is growing to replace fossil fuels due to the continuous consumption of fossil fuels and ever-increasing environmental problems. Wind and solar energy systems are the most well-known renewable energy sources which are used as power generation systems.1 However, the power output of wind and solar energy systems is dependent on climatic and geographic conditions.2 One promising alternative is hydrogen, which has the great advantage that it can be produced by coupling renewable energies such as wind and solar energies with water electrolysis.3–6 Hydrogen is a suitable option and it can be used as a fuel to get a reliable power for almost every application in which fossil fuels are used. Furthermore, hydrogen can be converted into other types of energies more efficiently than fossil fuels.2 By the way, hydrogen produced during water electrolysis is without carbon monoxide which will poison the Pt catalyst in proton exchange membrane fuel cells.
Electrochemical hydrogen evolution from water splitting has attracted more and more attention in alkaline media. In alkaline media, electrochemical water electrolysis involves two half-reactions: the cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER, 2H2O + 2e = 2OH− + H2) and the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER, 4OH− = 2H2O + 4e + O2). Of the two half-reactions, the OER requires formation of two oxygen–oxygen bonds in the four-electron redox processes, which makes it more kinetically demanding for the OER.7–9 So, the OER needs a relatively high overpotential at the anode. The high overpotential in the irreversible OER is a major cause of high energy consumption. Thus, a lot of efforts have been devoted to exploring electrocatalysts with low OER overpotential. The rutile-type oxides of RuO2 and IrO2 show the lowest OER overpotential, however, these oxides suffer from poor chemical stability in alkaline media and the high price and limited supply of Ru and Ir.10–17 So other metal oxides such as Co oxide, Ni oxide, NiCo2O4, Ni–Li oxide, Ni–Fe oxide and Zn–Co oxide have been developed.18–33 Manganese is an earth-abundant element and manganese oxides have been already demonstrated to have high activity for the OER.34–41 For further enhancement of the OER properties, considerable efforts have been devoted to exploring electrocatalysts with low OER overpotential by adding a second element. As is known, the catalytic activity of manganese oxides for the OER will be enhanced by Pt, Pd and Au.42–45 However, the high price and limited supply of Pt, Pd and Au are major barriers to the development of the OER using Pt-based, Pd-based and Au-based catalysts. Therefore, researchers are making their efforts to study high-performance catalysts without noble-metals. For instance, Gao and his cooperators reported that Mn3O4/CoSe2 displays a superior OER performance relative to parent CoSe2 nanobelts.46 Titanium oxide modified catalysts, especially IrO2–TiO2, have been particularly recognized as the most efficient electrocatalysts for the OER.47,48 Cai and his cooperators presented a controllable and reliable sol-flame doping method for the synthesis of TiO2:Co nanowires (NWs) that exhibit significantly enhanced electrocatalytic activity for the OER.49
In this paper, one-dimensional (1D) core–shell TiO2/MnOx NW arrays were grown directly on a carbon cloth substrate which is a flexible conductive substrate. Hydrogen-treated TiO2 (denoted as H–TiO2) NWs act as the core (conducting scaffold) to support electrochemically active MnOx. In comparison to bulk materials, 1D NW arrays such as nanowire/nanorod arrays are the most attractive materials due to their high interfacial area between the electrode and electrolyte for charge transport and fast electrical pathways among the numerous nanostructures.49–55 According to the recent research, such a structure permits reactants to diffuse into the catalyst layer easily and form a larger three-phase interface, resulting in the reduction of the liquid sealing effect, hence improving the catalyst performance.56 Lei and his cooperators have reported that Ni–Co–O@Ni–Co–S hierarchical NW arrays show a significantly improved activity for the OER.57 Wang and his cooperators have reported that hierarchical Ni3S2 nanorod arrays exhibit a low overpotential of 200 and 217 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm2 for the HER and OER, which are the best non-noble metal HER/OER electrocatalysts reported in the literature.58 The hierarchical NW arrays can offer a higher surface area and porosity, while the conductivity can be well preserved. The hierarchical porosity could accelerate the diffusion of OH− ions, thus resulting in faster kinetics.
Experimental
TiO2 NWs were grown on a carbon cloth substrate by a seed-assisted hydrothermal method reported elsewhere.56 The carbon cloth (6.0 cm × 3.0 cm) was cleaned with ethanol and distilled water and then dried at room temperature. The pre-cleaned carbon cloth was immersed into 0.2 mol L−1 titanium(IV) chloride aqueous solution for 10 min and blow-dried with compressed air. And then the carbon cloth was heated on a hotplate in air at 350 °C for 10 min to form TiO2 nanoparticles on the carbon cloth surface (TiO2 nanoparticle seeded substrate). 15 mL hydrochloric acid (37%) was diluted with 15 mL deionized water, and mixed with 0.45 mL titanium-n-butoxide. This solution mixture and the seeded carbon cloth were transferred to a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave (40 mL volume). The sealed autoclave was heated in an electric oven at 150 °C for 5 h, and then it was cooled down slowly to room temperature. A TiO2 NW film was uniformly coated on the carbon cloth surface. The sample was thoroughly washed with deionized water and then air dried, and then annealed in air at 550 °C for 1 h and then hydrogenated at 800 °C for an additional hour to form H–TiO2 NWs. H–TiO2/MnOx NWs were obtained by depositing a MnOx thin layer onto the surface of H–TiO2 NWs by anodic electrodeposition. The electrodeposition was conducted in a solution (15 mL) containing manganese acetate (0.1 mol L−1) and sodium sulfate (0.1 mol L−1) at 1.0 V for 60 s at room temperature. MnOx was deposited on the carbon cloth under the same conditions for comparison.
X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurement was conducted on a PANalytical, PW3040/60 diffractometer with monochromatized Cu Ka radiation (λ = 0.15418 nm). The structural properties of electrode materials were characterized by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, JSM-6330F), transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM2010-HR, 200 kV), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, ESCALab250, Thermo VG). All electrochemical measurements were performed in a three-electrode cell using an EG&GPAR283 electrochemical work station (Princeton, USA) in a temperature-controlled water-bath (Poly-science 9106, U.S.A.) at 298 K. Solutions were freshly prepared before each experiment. A platinum foil (3.0 cm2) was used as the counter electrode. All the potentials were measured versus a saturated calomel electrode (SCE, 0.241 V versus NHE). A salt bridge was used between the cell and the reference electrode.
Results and discussion
Chemical bonding states in the H–TiO2/MnOx NW support on the carbon cloth were analyzed by XPS as shown in Fig. 1. A survey of H–TiO2/MnOx NWs is shown in Fig. 1a and the peaks correspond to the existence of C 1s, Ti 2p, Mn 2p and O 1s. The binding energy of the C 1s peak is located at 284.4 eV which is related to the graphitic carbon in the carbon cloth as shown in Fig. 1a. The values of binding energy for Ti 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 typical peaks of TiO2 (Fig. 1b) are centered at 458.4 eV and 464.3 eV and these values are consistent with those in the literature.59 The XPS spectra of Mn 2p binding energy for the H–TiO2/MnOx NWs are shown in Fig. 1c. By performing a peak fitting deconvolution, the Mn 2p3/2 spectrum appears as three peaks: 640.8 (MnO), 642.0 (Mn2O3) and 643.5 (MnO2) eV, respectively.60–62 The value of binding energy for the Mn 2p1/2 typical peak is centered at 653.8 eV. The presence of multiple valence manganese oxides in the H–TiO2/MnOx NWs is apt to effect the redox reaction due to electron transfer. Two components can be clearly observed from the O 1s spectrum as shown in Fig. 1d, corresponding to two types of oxygen-containing species. The bands at 529.6 eV and 531.4 eV can be assigned to the oxygen bonds of Mn–O–Mn and Mn–OH, respectively.63

The XRD patterns of MnOx, H–TiO2 NWs, and H–TiO2/MnOx NWs grown on the carbon cloth substrate are shown in Fig. 2a. The diffraction peak at around 26.5° observed in all the samples is assigned to the (002) plane of the carbon of the carbon cloth. The diffraction peaks of manganese oxides can not be found in MnOx, which proves that it is an amorphous material. The diffraction peaks around 27.4, 36.1, 39.2, 41.2, 54.3, 56.6, 62.8 and 64.0° are assigned to the (110), (101), (200), (111), (210), (211), (220) and (002) facets of the rutile crystallite TiO2. In the XRD pattern of H–TiO2/MnOx NWs, all the diffraction peaks of TiO2 can be found and that of manganese oxides cannot be found, which also proves that MnOx in the H–TiO2/MnOx NWs is an amorphous material. Fig. 2b and c are the SEM images of H–TiO2 NWs on the carbon cloth and show that the entire surface of the carbon fiber on the carbon cloth is covered uniformly by H–TiO2 NWs with a diameter of 40–70 nm and a length of 0.7–1 μm. H–TiO2 NWs are highly ordered with uniform diameter and length. Even after depositing a MnOx thin layer onto the surface of H–TiO2 NWs by anodic electrodeposition, the NWs still exist as shown in Fig. 2d and e. Fig. 2f is the SEM image of MnOx on the carbon cloth and shows that the entire surface of the carbon fiber is covered by the MnOx layer with a smooth surface.

The typical TEM images of H–TiO2/MnOx NWs are shown in Fig. 3. Fig. 3a shows that the diameter is 50–80 nm and the length is 0.5–0.8 μm for the H–TiO2/MnOx NWs. The entire surface of the H–TiO2 NWs is covered uniformly by MnOx. The MnOx shell has an average thickness of 7.0 nm as shown in the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image (Fig. 3b). In the inset figure of Fig. 3b, the parallel fringe with a spacing of 0.32 nm corresponds to the (110) plane of rutile TiO2. From the HRTEM observation, the TiO2 has a highly crystalline nature. However, there are no parallel fringes for MnOx. Selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) analysis confirms that H–TiO2 growing along the [001] axis is a single crystal. However, there is no electron diffraction for MnOx, which also proves that MnOx in the H–TiO2/MnOx NWs is an amorphous material.

In order to illustrate the advantages of the TiO2/MnOx NW electrocatalyst, the OER activities of MnOx, H–TiO2 NWs and H–TiO2/MnOx NWs are evaluated through linear sweep voltammetric (LSV) curves in 0.1 mol L−1 KOH with a sweep rate of 0.001 V s−1 as shown in Fig. 4. The areas of all the electrodes were 1.0 cm2 (1.0 cm × 1.0 cm). The onset potentials (Es) of the OER are 0.534 V on the MnOx electrode, 0.575 V on the H–TiO2 NW electrode, and 0.524 V on the H–TiO2/MnOx NW electrode, respectively. The lower the value of Es is, the easier the OER occurs. The OER has the lowest value of Es on the H–TiO2/MnOx NW electrode, so the OER occurs most easily on the H–TiO2/MnOx NW electrode. The values of current density at 0.7 V (j0.7 V) are 7.4, 4.5 and 17.2 mA cm−2 on the MnOx, H–TiO2 NWs and H–TiO2/MnOx NW electrodes. The value of j0.7 V on the H–TiO2/MnOx NW electrode is 2.3 and 3.8 times higher than that on the MnOx and H–TiO2 NW electrodes. The H–TiO2 NWs are poorly active for the OER and the MnOx as a major potential feasible electrocatalyst shows a considerable activity. The current density improves not only by the surface area of the MnOx support on the H–TiO2 NWs, but also by a synergistic effect between TiO2 and MnOx because the value of Es is lower and the current density is higher on the H–TiO2/MnOx electrode than that on the MnOx and H–TiO2 NW electrode.64,65

The stability of the OER on all the electrodes is investigated by chronoamperometry and chronopotentiometry. According to the report of Jaramillo and his cooperators, the stability loss of the OER could be due to lots of factors, such as corrosion, material degradation, surface passivation and so on.66 Meng and his cooperators have synthesized manganese oxides of various structures (amorphous, α-, β-, and δ-MnO2), which have been studied systematically as OER catalysts. They have observed significant material loss under long-term electrolysis.67 The chronoamperometric curves for the OER in 0.1 mol L−1 KOH solution under a potential of 0.7 V are shown in Fig. 5a. Until the end of the experiment, the oxidation current density on the H–TiO2/MnOx NW electrode is 9.8 mA cm−2, which is 1.3 times higher than that on the MnOx electrode (7.4 mA cm−2). The result shows that the OER on the H–TiO2/MnOx NW electrode has a higher current density than that on the MnOx electrode with the same potential. The chronopotentiometric curves for the OER in 0.1 mol L−1 KOH solution under a current density of 10 mA cm−2 are shown in Fig. 5b. The potential required to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm−2 is an important performance index for OER catalysts, because it is approximately the current density for a 10% efficiency of solar-to-fuel conversion.66,68 In the initial several minutes, the voltages have sharp increases. At 20 min, the corresponding potentials are 1.20 V for the MnOx, 1.34 V for the H–TiO2 NWs and 1.13 V for the H–TiO2/MnOx NWs, and then the potentials remain almost the same after the test time. The results show that the OER on the H–TiO2/MnOx NW electrode has a lower electrolysis potential than that on the MnOx electrode with the same current density.

The percentages of different valences for manganese oxide in the H–TiO2/MnOx NWs after a 30 min chronoamperometry test at 0.7 V in 0.1 mol L−1 KOH solution were analyzed by XPS as shown in Fig. 6. Before the test, the percentages are 13.9% for Mn2+, 39.5% for Mn3+ and 46.6% for Mn4+ in the H–TiO2/MnOx NWs. After the test, the percentages are 23.0% for Mn2+, 36.8% for Mn3+ and 40.6% for Mn4+ in the H–TiO2/MnOx NWs. The percentage of Mn2+ increases and the percentages of Mn3+ and Mn4+ decrease in the H–TiO2/MnOx NWs after the test. Takashima and his cooperators have assumed that the Mn4+ is first reduced to Mn3+ by electron injection from H2O, and then Mn3+ is further reduced to Mn2+ when the O2 evolution occurs during the OER in alkaline media at pH ≥ 9.69 So the amount of Mn2+ increases and the amounts of Mn3+ and Mn4+ decrease after the test, which also proves the assumption. Transformation between manganese oxides indicates electronic movement, and the presence of multiple valence manganese oxides on the surface of the H–TiO2/MnOx NWs is conducive to electron transfer.

Conclusions
H–TiO2/MnOx NWs with a diameter of 50–80 nm and a length of 0.5–0.8 μm supported on carbon cloth have been successfully prepared. The entire surface of the H–TiO2 NWs is covered uniformly by amorphous MnOx with an average thickness of 7.0 nm. The H–TiO2 NWs are poorly active for the OER and the MnOx as a major potential feasible electrocatalyst shows a considerable activity. The onset potential shifts negatively and the current density improves not only by the surface area of the MnOx support on the H–TiO2 NWs, but also by a synergistic effect between TiO2 and MnOx. The percentage of Mn2+ increases and the percentages of Mn3+ and Mn4+ decrease after a 30 min chronopotentiometry test at 0.7 V in 0.1 mol L−1 solution, which proves the assumption that the Mn4+ is first reduced to Mn3+ by electron injection from H2O, and then Mn3+ is further reduced to Mn2+ when the O2 evolution occurs during the OER in alkaline media at pH ≥ 9. The presence of multiple valence manganese oxides in the H–TiO2/MnOx NWs is apt to effect the OER due to electron transfer. This work of developing complex nanostructured electrodes provides new insights into using transition metal oxide and carbon materials as high performance electrocatalysts for the OER in water electrolysis.
