    , Accepted 13th September 2012First published on 13th September 2012AbstractNaYF4 nanoparticles (NPs) were synthesized by a facile solvothermal approach using polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) as a surfactant. The NPs were doped into P3HT:PCBM blend to fabricate inverted polymer bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells. The dependence of device performance on the weight ratio of NPs in the blend film was investigated. The results showed that the open-circuit voltage was apparently enhanced by doping NaYF4 NPs/PVP composites into the active layer while maintaining the short-circuit current density and fill factor, leading to an increase in power conversion efficiency. The results of cyclic voltammetry measurement revealed that PVP had a deeper HOMO energy level than that of P3HT. PVP carried by NPs might also form charge transfer (CT) complexes with PCBM, which can make contributions to the open-circuit voltage. The study of photoluminescence (PL) spectra indicated clear evidence for enhanced exciton dissociation and reduced charge recombination in the blend film with NPs.
1. Introduction
Solution-processed BHJ polymer solar cells (PSCs) have progressed greatly since they were first reported in 1995.1–9 BHJ solar cells based on regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and the highly soluble fullerene derivative [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) have exhibited efficiencies approaching 5%,10–12 while efficiencies of 9% have been reported with low band gap polymers as electron donors.13 However, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs is still not high enough for commercial use. In recent years, inverted PSCs have been demonstrated as a promising alternative to the conventional structure for obtaining higher device performance, due to the advantages of utilizing the spontaneous vertical phase separation.14,15 Furthermore, the inverted devices improve stability16 by omitting the low work function metal cathode and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)/poly(styrene-sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS), which are both detrimental to device lifetime. In addition, it has been reported that the incorporation of inorganic nanoparticles (INPs) into the blend films can tune the morphology of the active layer and thus, apparently improve the performance of PSCs.17,18 Meanwhile, the metallic nanoparticles, which exhibit localized surface plasmon resonances, can also play a role as light-scattering centers.19,20
P3HT:PCBM blend is one of the most popular composites used as the active layer in BHJ solar cells. However, the open-circuit voltage (Voc) of P3HT:PCBM-based devices is originally limited by the energy offset of donor and acceptor materials. In this communication, we provide a new approach to enhance the Voc of inverted P3HT:PCBM PSCs. We prepared cubic phase NaYF4 nanoparticles (NPs) by a facile solvothermal method using polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) as a surfactant and doped the NPs into the P3HT:PCBM blend film. The NPs have an average size of ∼45 nm and can be well dispersed in the BHJ solution. The device performances with different concentrations of NPs are investigated and compared. The open-circuit voltage (Voc) of inverted PSCs can be enhanced by incorporating PVP modified NaYF4 NPs into P3HT:PCBM blend film while maintaining the short-circuit current density (Jsc) and fill factor (FF).
2. Experimental details
For the preparation of NaYF4 NPs, 0.5 g PVP K-30 (58000 g mol−1) was dissolved in 8 mL ethylene glycol (EG, AR). Then 0.24 g YCl3·xH2O (99.99%, Alfa Aesar) was added and dispersed under stirring. This solution was labeled as solution A. 0.23 g sodium fluoride (NaF, AR) was dissolved in 10 mL EG and added dropwise to solution A. The mixture was kept stirring for at least 30 min and subsequently transferred into a polytetrafluoroethylene autoclave and reacted at 150 °C for 24 h. After cooling down to room temperature, the product was obtained by centrifugation and washed with deionized (DI) water and ethanol. To remove the residual NaF completely, the product should be washed with warm DI water for several times. The precipitate was dried at 60 °C.
The devices were fabricated with the structure of indium tin oxide (ITO)/nano-crystal titanium dioxide (nc-TiO2)/P3HT:PCBM:NaYF4 NPs/tungsten oxide (WO3)/silver (Ag). WO3 with high work function (−4.8 eV)5 will enhance hole collection at the photoactive layer/Ag interface, while the nc-TiO2 film on the ITO side is an electron-selective layer. Hence the device works inverted. Patterned ITO-coated glass substrates were sonicated consecutively with acetone, isopropyl alcohol, and DI water for 10 min. TiO2 thin films were subsequently prepared as described in our previous papers.5,21 For the active layer, the 1,2-dichlorobenzene (DCB) solution composed of P3HT (15 mg mL−1), PCBM (15 mg mL−1), and NaYF4 NPs (x mg mL−1, x = 0, 6, 10, 15) was spin-cast at 700 rpm on top of the nc-TiO2 layer in air. P3HT and PCBM were purchased from Lumtec Corp. and used without further purification. Then the samples were baked in low vacuum (vacuum oven) at 150 °C for 10 min. Finally, the devices were completed by thermal evaporation of 10 nm WO3 and Ag electrode. The active area of the device was about 0.064 cm2.
X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis of NaYF4 NPs powder was carried out with a powder diffractometer (Model Rigaku RU-200b), using Ni-filtered Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å) with 200 mA current and 50 kV voltage across the tube to generate powerful X-rays. The XRD measurement was performed at a scan rate of 18° min−1 and step size of 0.02°. The morphology of NaYF4 nano-crystals and the blend film with NaYF4 NPs was investigated by TEM (Hitachi, H-600 100KV) and FE-SEM (JEOL, JSM-7500F). To characterize the electronic structures of P3HT, PCBM and PVP, cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed using a standard one-compartment, three-electrode electrochemical cell attached to a CHI660C Electrochemical Workstation. A glass carbon disk (Φ = 3 mm), a platinum wire with a porous ceramic wick and an Ag/Ag+ non-aqueous electrode were used as the working electrode, the auxiliary electrode and the reference electrode, respectively. The redox couple ferricinium/ferrocene (Fc/Fc+) was used as external standard. The supporting electrolyte was 0.1 mol L−1 Bu4NPF6 in dry acetonitrile. All solutions were purged with nitrogen before measurement. A 100 W xenon lamp equipped in the Hitachi F-4500 fluorescence spectrophotometer was used as the PL pump source. The PL spectra of the BHJ films were recorded under the same conditions with a Hitachi F-4500 fluorescence spectrophotometer [450 nm for excitation wavelength, 5.0 nm for spectral resolution (FWHM) of the spectrophotometer and 400 V for PMT voltage] at room temperature. Current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of PSCs were measured with a computer-programmed Keithley 2400 source/meter under AM 1.5G solar illuminations with an Oriel 300 W solar simulator intensity of ∼100 mW cm−2 in air without encapsulation. The light intensity was measured with a photometer (International Light, IL1400) corrected by a standard silicon solar cell. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) was measured with Crowntech QTest Station 1000 AD. The absorption and reflection spectra were measured by means of ultraviolet/visible spectrometer (UV 1700, Shimadzu).
3. Results and discussion
The XRD pattern of NaYF4 sample is shown in Fig. 1(a), where the diffraction peaks are in good agreement with the data of cubic-phase NaYF4 nanocrystals (JCPDS No. 06-0342, α = 5.448 Å), and no other peaks of impurities have been detected. This indicates that the products are pure cubic NaYF4 crystals and demonstrates the highly crystalline nature of NaYF4. Fig. 1(b) and (c) show the SEM and TEM images of the cubic phase NaYF4 crystals. It can be estimated that the as-prepared NaYF4 NPs have an average size of ∼45 nm. Since both the nitrogen and oxygen atoms of PVP have lone pair electrons which can combine with the empty orbital of metal ions, PVP can act as a chelating agent and coordinate with Y3+ in the reaction process.22 As a result, the NPs are capped by PVP [inset of Fig. 1(c)]. After the formation of NPs, PVP serves as a surfactant and drives the dispersion of the NPs in the DCB solution. The TEM image [Fig. 1(d)] of the P3HT:PCBM:NaYF4 NPs blend film reveals that the NPs aggregate into small clusters that are almost uniformly dispersed in the BHJ film after being annealed at 150 °C for 10 min.

The NaYF4 NPs were blended into a BHJ solution with different weight ratios. The device architecture is shown schematically in Fig. 2(a). Fig. 2(b) shows J–V characteristics of the devices with different weight ratios of NPs under AM 1.5G illumination with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2 in ambient air. The control device without NaYF4 NPs exhibits a Jsc of 9.38 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.56 V and FF of 54.3%, leading to a PCE of 2.85%. However, the device with 0.45 wt% NPs exhibits a better PCE of 3.48% with Jsc of 9.63 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.62 V, and FF of 58.3%. As NaYF4 NPs are almost nonconductive, introducing NPs into the active layer will generally contribute to the series resistance of the device. Therefore, further increment in the weight ratio of NaYF4 NPs would decrease device performances. The detailed results are summarized in Table 1. Another control experiment was performed by simply adding PVP (1 mg mL−1) into the formulation without the NPs (Fig. 3). The result shows that the Voc of the device with 0.075 wt% PVP is higher than that of the undoped device. However, the device has a poor FF. This might arise from a poor phase separation and increased exciton and/or charge carrier recombination. The inset of Fig. 1(c) shows that the PVP molecules carried by NPs form into spherical shells. It can be deduced that the uniformly dispersed NPs in the BHJ film would increase the effective contact area of PVP/PCBM and P3HT/PCBM. As a result, the phase separation of active layer can be improved, leading to an increase in FF.

PVP does not have a completely conjugated bond. However, its molecular structure resembles a polymeric backbone with hole conducting molecules (pyrrolidone) as side chains.23 It has also been demonstrated to form charge transfer (CT) complexes with C60 due to the CT interaction of PVP functional groups with the C60 surface.24–26 Therefore, one can reasonably deduce that PCBM, which is a derivative of C60, can also form CT complexes with PVP on the surface of NaYF4 NPs. The CT states at the interface between polymer and PCBM are considered to be the origin of Voc of polymer–fullerene PSCs.27–29 The effective band gap of the BHJ determined by the onset of photocurrent generation by CT absorption linearly correlates with the Voc of the BHJ solar cells.27 In addition, the energy of the CT states is proportional to the energy difference between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level of the electron donors and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level of the electron acceptors.29 It can be understood that the CT states of PVP/PCBM and P3HT/PCBM coexist in the NaYF4 NPs-doped BHJ film. To investigate the mechanism of the increased Voc, electronic structures (HOMO and LUMO levels) of P3HT, PCBM and PVP are probed by CV measurement. The results are calculated and summarized in Table 2. The energy alignment of materials used in the device is illustrated in Fig. 4(a). It can be seen that the HOMO level of PVP (−5.93 eV) is much deeper than that of P3HT (−5.21 eV), creating a larger energy difference HOMOdonor − LUMOacceptor between PVP and PCBM (−6 eV) than that between P3HT and PCBM. The energy of CT states at the PVP/PCBM interface is, therefore, larger than that at the P3HT/PCBM interface. Consequently, the Voc is increased owing to the existence of CT states at PVP/PCBM interface. Note that no significant increase in Jsc occurs since PVP/PCBM contributes limited photocurrent due to negligible absorption of PVP in ultraviolet–visible and infrared regions. Fig. 4(b) shows the dark J–V curves of inverted PSCs with different weight ratios of NPs. It can be seen that the diffusion current dominated regime is shifted toward higher forward bias in the case of the incorporation of 0.45 wt% NPs, suggesting that the built-in potential increases when introducing 0.45 wt% NPs. This provides significant evidence that the Voc can be enhanced by doping with NaYF4 NPs/PVP composites.30

The incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) spectra of devices with and without NPs are shown in Fig. 5(a). The IPCE of the device without NPs shows a maximum of ∼57% at 540 nm. When incorporating 0.45 wt% NPs, the IPCE of the device shows a maximum of ∼62% at 550 nm, a little higher than that of the control device. This is consistent with the data from J–V curves. The interference patterns can have a significant effect on how much light is absorbed.31 The absorption spectra of the finished devices (with Ag reflective electrodes) were measured using a traditional reflection-mode absorption measurement. It shows that the absorptions of the devices with 0.45 wt% and 0.75 wt% NPs are enhanced [Fig. 5(b)]. The enhanced absorption in the NPs doped devices can be attributed to the light scattering of cubic phase NaYF4 NPs.20 The light scattering of NPs is strengthened by the reflection in thin films, leading to the improvement in the IPCE.

The PL is measured to further examine the exciton dissociation in the BHJ films. Fig. 5(d) shows the PL spectra of the neat P3HT film and the BHJ films with different weight ratios of NPs annealed at 150 °C for 10 min. The PL signals are corrected with the absorption spectra of the active layers with different weight ratios at wavelength of 450 nm [Fig. 5(c)]. PL quenching is observed for the BHJ film with 0.45 wt% NPs comparing to that without NPs. This provides direct evidence for enhanced exciton dissociation and reduced electron–hole recombination by incorporating the NPs, which can also contribute to the improvement in the performance of PSCs.
4. Conclusions
In conclusion, cubic-phase NaYF4 nanocrystals with an average size of ∼45 nm are prepared by a facile solvothermal approach using PVP as a surfactant. The PSCs exhibit an overall PCE of 3.5% by incorporating 0.45 wt% NaYF4 NPs into the P3HT:PCBM blend films. The introduction of hole-conducting PVP that has a deeper HOMO level than P3HT, carried by NaYF4 NPs, enhances Voc from 0.56 V to 0.62 V via the formation of CT complexes with PCBM and thus increasing the built-in potential across the active layer. Simultaneously, the insertion of NPs maintains both Jsc and FF, leading to the overall efficiency improvement.
