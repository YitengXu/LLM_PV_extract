We expect that the flexible metal NW-parylene C TEs can be used as key elements for a variety of next generation optoelectronic devices.
Introduction
Transparent electrodes (TEs) have been widely used as key components for various optoelectronic devices such as touch panels, sensors, displays, and solar cells.1–5 A conventional indium tin oxide (ITO) TE possesses outstanding physical properties for practical optoelectronic devices. However, it is mechanically brittle and requires a high processing temperature of over 200 °C to achieve excellent optoelectronic properties.6 Therefore, new flexible TEs have been required for next generation optoelectronic devices such as flexible solar cells and displays.7–10 Recently, metal nanowire (NW) TEs based on silver nanowires (AgNWs) and copper nanowires (CuNWs) have shown a superior optoelectronic performance, comparable to the conventional ITO TE.11–13 Moreover, they have exhibited excellent flexibility.14,15 However, they have problems in long-term stability and high surface roughness, which are inappropriate for practical use.7,8 It is well-known that AgNW and CuNW TEs are easily oxidized under ambient conditions, resulting in a severe increase of their sheet resistance values.10,16 Therefore, it is required to suppress the oxidation of the metal NWs to improve the long-term stability of the metal NW TEs. In addition, it is crucial to reduce the surface roughness of the metal NW TEs for efficient and reliable device fabrication.7 Recently, much effort has been made in developing novel protection layers for the metal NW TEs. Several approaches have addressed this issue including polymer matrices, graphene oxide, graphene, metal oxide, and metal layers.16–21 However, these protection layers require high pressure and temperature processes as well as chemical treatment, which can damage underlying metal NWs and substrates. The fundamental problem of the metal NW TEs has not been completely solved yet. Therefore, it is imperative that we develop a new protection layer for the metal NW TEs, which has excellent flexibility and stability without deterioration of the optoelectronic properties of the metal NW TEs for practical optoelectronic devices.
Parylene C is a chemical vapor deposited poly(chloro-p-xylylene) polymer. It can be easily synthesized from chlorine substituted 2,2-paracyclophane, which is known as the parylene C dimer, under low pressure and at room temperature.22 It has been used as a packaging material for a variety of electronic and medical devices due to its excellent thermal stability, good chemical inertness, superior gas-impermeability, and easy fabrication process.23–25 Moreover, it possesses outstanding optical transparency as well as a high degree of conformality and uniformity.26,27 Recently, it was reported that the thin parylene C film became electrically conductive as its thickness decreased to nanoscale.28
Here, we report high-performance metal NW-parylene C TEs fabricated by using the pyrolytic deposition process of a parylene C protection layer onto metal NW films at room temperature for the first time. The surface roughness of AgNW and CuNW TEs was greatly reduced by depositing the parylene C protection layer. The AgNW-parylene C TE showed superior optoelectronic properties such as high optical transmittance (94.7%) and low sheet resistance (41.6 Ω sq−1), comparable to conventional ITO. It was also found that a AgNW-parylene C TE fabricated on a plastic substrate showed superior flexibility. Moreover, the metal NW-parylene C TE exhibited significantly improved oxidation and chemical stability because of the outstanding gas barrier properties of the parylene C protection layer. Furthermore, the potential suitability of the AgNW-parylene C TE was successfully demonstrated by fabricating highly flexible and efficient polymer solar cells (PSCs).
Experimental
Fabrication of AgNW TEs
Various substrates such as glass, polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polyethylene naphthalate (PEN), and polycarbonate (PC) were cleaned using acetone, deionized water, and isopropyl alcohol (IPA) by sonication. To obtain a hydrophilic surface, cleaned glass substrates were treated with UV-ozone for 20 min. Then, AgNW ink (ClearOhm ink, Cambrios Technologies Corporation) was spin-coated onto the cleaned glass substrates. The average length and diameter of AgNWs are about 20 μm and 40 nm, respectively. The spin-coated AgNW ink was then dried at 120 °C for 5 min.
Preparation of CuNWs
CuCl2·2H2O (189 mg, 1.11 mmol), hexadecylamine (HDA) (1296 mg, 5.37 mmol), and glucose (450 mg, 2.50 mmol) were dissolved in deionized water (30 mL). The reaction mixture was vigorously stirred at room temperature overnight. It was heated at 100 °C and stirred for 6 h. Then, it was cooled to room temperature. The color of the reaction mixture changed from blue to reddish brown. The reaction mixture was washed with warm deionized water (60 °C). To remove the excess HDA and glucose, the suspension was centrifuged for several cycles. Subsequently, CuNWs were rinsed in hexane and IPA by centrifugation. Then, the precipitates of CuNWs were dispersed in IPA. The dispersed CuNWs in IPA were filtered using a cellulose acetate membrane filter and dried in nitrogen gas. The average length and diameter of CuNWs are about 30 μm and 35 nm, respectively.
Fabrication of CuNW TEs
CuNWs were added to hexane to be dispersed and remove the HDA. Then, the solution of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) in IPA (10 mg/15 mL) was added into the dispersed CuNWs in hexane, and the mixture was stored for 24 h. The dispersion was centrifuged to obtain PVP capped CuNWs. CuNW ink was prepared by dispersion of the PVP capped CuNWs in IPA. A CuNW TE was prepared by the Meyer bar coating method on a substrate. Then, the CuNW TE was annealed in an Ar-filled glove box at 250 °C for 30 min.
Fabrication of metal NW-parylene C TEs
The parylene C protection layer was simply deposited onto a metal NW film using a pyrolytic deposition system with the parylene C dimer. The metal NW film was placed in a parylene C deposition chamber (0.01 Torr) and the parylene C dimer was placed in a sublimation furnace. The thickness of the parylene C protection layer was controlled by changing the amount of the parylene C dimer. The parylene C dimer was sublimed in a sublimation furnace at 125 °C and cleaved in a pyrolysis furnace at 670 °C to obtain a reactive monomer. The reactive monomer was then polymerized by the chain growth reaction on top of the metal NW film at room temperature.
Fabrication of bulk heterojunction polymer solar cells based on AgNW and AgNW-parylene C TEs
Bulk heterojunction polymer solar cells were prepared as follows. The AgNW and AgNW-parylene C TEs were treated with UV-ozone for 3 min and spin-coated with a ZnO solution. The ZnO solution was prepared by dissolving zinc acetate dehydrate (Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O, 1 g) and ethanolamine (NH2CH2CH2OH, 0.28 g) in 2-methoxyethanol (CH3OCH2CH2OH, 10 mL). The ZnO coated AgNW and AgNW-parylene C TEs were annealed for 1 h at 200 °C in air. The thickness of the ZnO layer was about 150 nm. PTB7 and [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) with a weight ratio of 1:1 were dissolved in chlorobenzene with 1,8-diiodooctane (3% v/v). Then, the PTB7:PC71BM solution was spin-coated onto the ZnO layer and dried for 20 min at room temperature in a glove box to form an active layer with a thickness of 100 nm. Finally, a MoO3 layer (10 nm) and an Ag layer (120 nm) were deposited by thermal evaporation in a high vacuum thermal evaporator (<10−7 Torr).
Fabrication of flexible bulk heterojunction polymer solar cells based on AgNW-parylene C/PET TEs
Flexible bulk heterojunction polymer solar cells were prepared as follows. The AgNW-parylene C/PET TE was treated with UV-ozone for 3 min and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS, CLEVIOS, AI4083) with 0.1% v/v Zonyl (Aldrich, FSO-100) was spin-coated onto the AgNW-parylene C/PET TE in a N2-purged glovebox. The thickness of the PEDOT:PSS layer was approximately 100 nm. The PEDOT:PSS-coated AgNW-parylene C/PET TE was annealed on a hot plate at 120 °C for 10 min to remove the solvent. PTB7 and [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) (1:1.5) were dissolved in chlorobenzene with 1,8-diiodooctane (3% v/v). Then, the PTB7:PC71BM solution was spin-coated onto the PEDOT:PSS layer and dried for 20 min at room temperature in the glovebox. Finally, a cathode layer composed of LiF (1 nm) and Al (120 nm) was deposited by thermal evaporation (<10−6 Torr).
Results and discussion
AgNW-parylene C TEs were simply fabricated using spin coating and pyrolytic deposition processes, as illustrated in Fig. 1(a). Firstly, AgNW films were prepared by the spin coating process with AgNW ink on pre-cleaned glass or polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrates. The AgNW films were annealed at 120 °C for 5 min. Then, the parylene C protection layer was deposited onto the AgNW film using a pyrolytic deposition system with chlorine substituted 2,2-paracyclophane, the so-called parylene C dimer.

The parylene C protection layer was successfully deposited by the chain growth reaction onto the AgNW film at room temperature. The thickness of the parylene C protection layer was easily controlled from 25 to 200 nm by changing the amount of the parylene C dimer. It is noteworthy that the underlying AgNWs remained intact during the parylene C deposition process because the entire process was performed at room temperature.
To confirm the deposition of the hydrophobic parylene C protection layer onto the AgNW TE, we measured contact angles of the AgNW and AgNW-parylene C TEs. The contact angle measurements were carried out at room temperature in air using deionized water. Fig. S1 (ESI†) shows the deionized water droplets on the surface of AgNW and AgNW-parylene C TEs. The deionized water contact angle of the AgNW TE was 38.7°. When 25 nm of the parylene C protection layer was deposited onto the AgNW TE, the deionized water contact angle increased to 84.5°, indicating that the parylene C protection layer was successfully deposited onto the AgNW TE. As the thickness of the parylene C layer increased from 25 to 200 nm, the deionized water contact angle increased from 84.5° to 93.5° due to the morphological change of the top surface, suggesting that the thick parylene C protection layer fully covered the underlying AgNW TE.
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra of the AgNW and AgNW-parylene C TEs were measured to confirm the deposition of the parylene C protection layer as shown in Fig. 1(b). As for the AgNW-parylene C TEs, Cl 2p and Cl 2s peaks appeared around 200 and 285 eV, respectively, verifying that the parylene C protection layer was successfully deposited onto the AgNW TE. Furthermore, the thickness of the parylene C protection layer affected the intensity of Cl 2s and Cl 2p peaks. As the thickness of the parylene C protection layer increased, the intensity of Cl 2s and Cl 2p peaks increased as shown in Fig. 1(b).
To investigate the optoelectronic properties of the AgNW-parylene C TE, we measured the optical transmittance and the sheet resistance of the AgNW and AgNW-parylene C TEs. The sheet resistance of AgNW and AgNW-parylene C TEs was evaluated using a non-contact sheet resistance instrument. The optical transmittance and the sheet resistance of the AgNW TE were 96.4% at 550 nm and 41.2 Ω sq−1 while those of the AgNW-parylene C TE with a parylene C layer thickness of 50 nm were 94.7% at 550 nm and 41.6 Ω sq−1, as shown in Fig. 1(c). This result verifies that the AgNW-parylene C TE possessed excellent optical transparency and electrical conductivity. In addition, there is no significant change in the sheet resistance even though the parylene C protection layer covers the underlying AgNW TE. The optical transmittance of the AgNW-parylene C TE was slightly reduced by about 1.7% due to the additional parylene C protection layer. Furthermore, we measured the optical transmittance and the sheet resistance of AgNW-parylene C TEs as a function of the thickness of the parylene C protection layer (Fig. S2, ESI†). There is a negligible change in the optical transmittance and sheet resistance with regard to various thicknesses of the parylene C protection layer. Both AgNW and AgNW-parylene C TEs showed high optical transparency and electrical conductivity.
In addition, to investigate the effect of the AgNW network density on the optoelectronic properties of the AgNW-parylene C TE, we changed the spin coating rate from 500 to 2000 rpm. As shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†), the sheet resistance and optical transmittance of the AgNW and AgNW-parylene C TE increased upon increasing the spin coating rate. When the spin-coating rate increased from 500 to 2000 rpm, the transmittance and sheet resistance of the AgNW-parylene C TEs increased from 90.9 to 95.1% and 17.3 to 78.5 Ω sq−1.
To evaluate the effect of the thickness of the parylene C protection layer on the surface morphology, the AgNW and AgNW-parylene C TEs were investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). As shown in Fig. 2, SEM images of the AgNW-parylene C TE clearly show that the parylene C protection layer fully covers the percolation network of the underlying AgNW film. In addition, as the thickness of the parylene C protection layer increases, the percolation network of the underlying AgNW film can be completely embedded into the parylene C protection layer. Fig. S4 (ESI†) shows atomic force microscopy (AFM) images of the AgNW and AgNW-parylene C TEs. The AgNW TE has inherently high surface roughness with a root-mean-square roughness (Rrms) of 12.2 nm. It is well-known that overlapping AgNWs can lead to electrical shorts in various optoelectronic devices.2 On the other hand, the AgNW-parylene C TE has relatively smooth surface roughness. The Rrms values of the AgNW-parylene C TEs decrease from 7.9 to 3.7 nm significantly as the thickness of the parylene C protection layer increases from 25 to 200 nm. These results verify that conformal deposition of the parylene C protection layer can make the rough surface of the AgNW TE smooth, leading to reduced Rrms values.

To investigate the haze property of the AgNW-parylene C TE, we carried out a haze test of the AgNW/PET and AgNW-parylene C/PET TEs. The haze value of the AgNW TE/PET was 2.03% (Fig. S5(a), ESI†). After the deposition of the parylene C protection layer (50 nm) onto the AgNW/PET TE, the haze value slightly decreased to 1.86% (Fig. S5(b), ESI†). It is well-known that the haze of the AgNW based TE is related to not only the diameter and the length of the AgNW but also the surface uniformity.29 The smooth surface of the AgNW-parylene C/PET TEs could lead to a reduced haze value. Furthermore, the AgNW-parylene C TE exhibited excellent mechanical adhesion on glass and PET substrates. To estimate the adhesion properties of the AgNW-parylene C TE, we performed a cross-cut test with 3 M scotch tape. After the cross-cut test, the square lattice of the AgNW-parylene C TE was damaged (Fig. S6(b), ESI†). In contrast, there was no significant change in the square lattice of the AgNW-parylene C TE as shown in Fig. S6(d) (ESI†), indicating that the AgNW-parylene C TE possessed excellent adhesion properties.
The AgNW-parylene C TE exhibits outstanding flexibility, which is indispensable for next generation optoelectronic devices. To examine its flexibility, a AgNW-parylene C TE was fabricated onto a PET substrate. Fig. 3(a) compares the flexibility of the AgNW-parylene C/PET and ITO/PET TEs as a function of bending cycles. A piece of the AgNW-parylene C/PET or ITO/PET TEs is rolled and unrolled around a bending radius of 7.5 mm. The ITO/PET TE begins to crack within the first few cycles, resulting in a severe increase in the sheet resistance.8 In contrast, the sheet resistance of the AgNW-parylene C/PET TE remains unchanged even after 10000 bending cycles, suggesting that the AgNW-parylene C/PET TE possesses an excellent flexibility.

To evaluate the gas barrier properties of the parylene C protection layer on the oxidation stability, the AgNW and AgNW-parylene C TEs were exposed to high temperature (70 °C) and high humidity (70% RH) conditions for 100 days. Fig. 3(b) shows the changes in sheet resistances of the AgNW and AgNW-parylene TEs during the oxidation stability tests. The sheet resistance of the AgNW TE increased about 700 times within 10 days due to the oxidation of AgNWs. In contrast, the sheet resistance of the AgNW-parylene C 200 nm TE increased less than 13% even after 100 days. For the AgNW TE, silver oxides on the surface of the AgNW were observed. In contrast, for the AgNW-parylene TE, there was no significant change on the surface (Fig. S8, ESI†). The AgNW-parylene C TEs exhibited oxidation stability, superior to the AgNW TEs. Moreover, it was found that the oxidation stability of the AgNW-parylene C TEs improved as the thickness of the parylene C protection layer increased. We also fabricated a CuNW-parylene C TE using pyrolytic deposition of the parylene C protection layer onto a CuNW film at room temperature. The optical transmittance and sheet resistance of the CuNW TE were 87.9% at 550 nm and 48.2 Ω sq−1 while those of the CuNW-parylene C TE were 86.1% at 550 nm and 48.5 Ω sq−1, as shown in Fig. S9 (ESI†). It is well known that the CuNWs are much easier to oxidize than AgNWs.11 Thus, it is crucial to suppress the oxidation of the CuNWs for improvement of the long-term stability of CuNW TEs. CuNW and CuNW-parylene C TEs were exposed to ambient conditions for 30 days (Fig. S10, ESI†). The sheet resistance of the CuNW TE increased over 760 times within 6 days. On the other hand, the sheet resistance of the CuNW-parylene C TE increased less than 1.4 times even after 30 days, verifying that the CuNW-parylene C TE showed much better oxidation resistance than the CuNW TE.
This remarkable difference in the change in sheet resistance between metal NW and metal NW-parylene C TEs demonstrates that metal NW-parylene C TEs possess outstanding oxidation stability compared to conventional metal NW TEs. One of the drawbacks of metal NW based TEs is that metal NWs can be easily corroded when they are exposed to acidic solution. In addition, AgNWs are easily degraded when they are exposed to solutions containing sulphide ions and a H2S gas environment for a short time. Therefore, the chemical stability of the metal NW based TEs should be improved. We carried out chemical stability tests on the AgNW, AgNW-parylene C (50 nm), and AgNW-parylene C (100 nm) TEs. The sheet resistance of the samples was measured after they were dipped into a PEDOT:PSS solution and Na2S aqueous solution. In the PEDOT:PSS solution, the sheet resistance of the AgNW-parylene C (50 nm) and AgNW-parylene C (100 nm) TEs slightly increased less than 17% and 3.4% for 5 min, respectively (Fig. 3(c)). In contrast, the sheet resistance of the AgNW TE increased more than 275% for 30 min due to the corrosion of AgNWs by the acidic PEDOT:PSS solution (Fig. 4(a)). In the Na2S aqueous solution, the sheet resistance of the AgNW-parylene C (50 nm) TE slightly increased less than 4% for 30 s (Fig. 3(d)). As for the AgNW-parylene C (100 nm) TE, the sheet resistance increased less than 0.45% for 30 s. In contrast, the sheet resistance of the AgNW TE sharply increased more than 300% within 30 s because AgNWs were corroded by the Na2S aqueous solution (Fig. 4(d)). These results indicate that as the thickness of the parylene C protection layer increases, the change in the sheet resistance decreases during the stability test. The AgNW-parylene C TE exhibited outstanding resistance against acidic corrosion by the PEDOT:PSS solution and sulfurization by Na2S solution, suggesting that the parylene C protection layer acted as an excellent gas barrier even under harsh conditions.

We utilized the AgNW and AgNW-parylene C TEs as cathode layers in inverted bulk heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells (PSCs). Firstly, the AgNW films were prepared on a glass substrate by the spin-coating process with AgNW ink, and the parylene C protection layer (50 nm) was deposited. Then, inverted BHJ PSCs were fabricated with a AgNW or AgNW-parylene C/ZnO/PTB7:PC71BM/MoO3/Ag structure. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of inverted BHJ PSCs based on the AgNW and AgNW-parylene C TEs under AM 1.5 G illumination (100 mW cm−2) are shown in Fig. 5. The PSC based on the AgNW TE showed an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.72 V, a short circuit current (Jsc) of 15.46 mA cm−2, a fill factor (FF) of 67.19% and a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 7.47%. The AgNW-parylene C TE based PSC exhibited a similar photovoltaic performance with a Voc of 0.69 V, a Jsc of 15.43 mA cm−2, a FF of 66.44% and a PCE of 7.11%. These results clearly confirm that the PSC based on the AgNW-parylene C TE performed well as that based on the AgNW TE. The slightly lower Voc from the PSC based on the AgNW-parylene C TE might be attributed to the mismatch of the energy level between the active layer and the underlying AgNWs caused by the dielectric parylene C protection layer. In addition, we successfully fabricated a flexible PSC with the AgNW-parylene C/PET TE. The flexible PSC was fabricated with a normal type structure of AgNW-parylene C/PEDOT:PSS/PTB7:PC71BM/LiF/Al. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the flexible PSC based on the AgNW-parylene C/PET TE under AM 1.5 G illumination (100 mW cm−2) are shown in Fig. S11 (ESI†). The flexible PSC with the AgNW-parylene C/PET TE exhibited a Voc of 0.70 V, a Jsc of 13.77 mA cm−2, a FF of 63.57% and a PCE of 6.12%, confirming that it showed excellent photovoltaic performance.

Conclusions
We successfully fabricated a metal NW-parylene C TE by depositing the parylene C protection layer onto AgNW and CuNW films at room temperature for the first time. The AgNW-parylene C TE showed superior optoelectronic properties such as high optical transmittance (94.7%) and low sheet resistance (41.6 Ω sq−1), comparable to conventional ITO. The metal NW-parylene C TE prepared on a plastic substrate showed outstanding flexibility. Moreover, the metal NW-parylene C TE exhibited significantly improved oxidation and chemical stability because of the outstanding gas barrier properties of the parylene C protection layer. The polymer solar cells based on the AgNW-parylene C TE exhibited high PCE and flexibility. We expect that the high-performance metal NW-parylene C TEs can be used as key components for next generation optoelectronic devices.
