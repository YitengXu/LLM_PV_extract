    , Accepted 8th July 2019First published on 8th July 2019AbstractThe selective photo-electrochemical oxidation of cyclohexene to 2-cyclohexene-1-one was successfully performed with excellent Faraday efficiency (>99%) via indirect oxidation with a PINO/NHPI mediator and O2 on a BiVO4/WO3 photoanode under low applied bias.
The conversion of solar energy to chemical energy as an alternative to fossil fuels to provide clean, limitless energy is an extremely important issue in today's environment.1 Since the discovery of the Honda and Fujishima effect in 1971,2 photo-electrochemical reactions have been intensively investigated owing to the significant reduction in external bias generated in these types of reactions compared to more conventional electrochemical reactions.3–5
Visible-light-active n-type semiconductor photoanodes made from metal oxides offer several advantages, including high chemical stability, low costs and simple preparation methods via calcination in air. The photo-electrochemical oxidation reactions which occur on the surface of these porous oxide photoanodes are commonly applied for splitting H2O molecules into H2 and O2 molecules and the degradation of organic compounds to CO2.3–5 Recently, photoanodic reactions were shown to be useful for both organic transformations and the oxidative production of high-value-added chemicals, such as H2O2/H2O and HClO/Cl−, instead of O2 production. It is expected that these types of anodic reactions will be integral in the next generation of photo-electrochemical systems.6 In particular, organic transformations by using a photo-electrochemical method are important to produce useful and valuable chemicals; however, previous works mainly focused on the oxidative degradation of toxic and/or harmful chemicals to CO2. Unfortunately, very few studies in the literature have addressed the issues that often arise during these types of reactions. Common problems encountered in the direct oxidative transformation of organic compounds into high-value-added chemicals include low reaction selectivity, caused by the high oxidation potential of the photoanodes, and the presence of competing oxidation reactions (such as degradation of the solvent, electrolyte and/or product).7–9 This means that more selective methods for the oxidation of organic compounds in photo-electrochemical systems are urgently needed.
Indirect methods using an oxidative mediator are potentially useful for improving the selectivity of photo-electrochemical reactions. Oxidative mediators are effectively activated on the photoanode surface and can facilitate homogeneous electron transfer with organic compounds in order to minimise the competing oxidation reactions as descried above (Fig. 1). In this context, a few reports have been published in which the effectivity of these indirect photo-electrochemical methods using oxidative mediators for organic transformations has been demonstrated. Choi et al. first reported on a 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine 1-oxyl (TEMPO)-mediated photo-electrochemical oxidation of alcohols to aldehydes using BiVO4 photoanodes.10 Berlinhuette et al. demonstrated that C–H bond activation in organic compounds with N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHSI) as an electron transfer mediator and t-BuOOH as a co-oxidant resulted in the formation of the corresponding carbonyl compounds.11 Our group was able to successfully generate the corresponding methoxylated product via activation of furan's C–H bond using Br+/Br−-mediated indirect oxidation and without the need for any additional co-oxidant.12
 Fig. 1  Schematic illustration of PINO/NHPI-mediated selective photo-electrochemical oxidation of cycloalkenes to cycloalkenones. 
Here, we investigate the use of N-hydroxyphthalimide (NHPI) as an electron transfer mediator. NHPI is oxidised to form the phthalimide N-oxyl (PINO) radical and acts as a useful catalyst for the abstraction of the hydrogen atom from the C–H bond of organic compounds. As such, PINO has a much higher oxidation potential than TEMPO and NHSI, and then, it allows various and commonly difficult organic transformations to be achieved such as oxidation of relatively inert hydrocarbons.13 In particular, the PINO/NHPI mediated activation of allylic compounds, represented by cycloalkenes, play a critical role in organic chemistry to synthesize versatile synthetic intermediates including cycloalkenones. Despite this, there are no reports on the utilisation of PINO for organic transformations in photo-electrochemical systems. In this study, a PINO/NHPI mediator was used for the oxidation of cycloalkenes to cycloalkenones, both of which have relatively inert C–H bonds, in a photo-electrochemical system with a BiVO4/WO3 composite photoanode (Fig. 1). The narrow band gap of BiVO4 (2.4 eV) engages many more photons in the visible light region, and as such, its valence band potential is much more negative when compared to those observed for WO3 and TiO2.14–16 A WO3 underlayer in the BiVO4/WO3 composite photoanode functions as a cistern for collecting e− from the BiVO4 conduction band. From our studies, it was found that the photo-electrochemical oxidation of cycloalkenes had an excellent Faraday efficiency (up to 99%) with a low applied bias. Characterization for the prepared porous photoelectrodes is given in the ESI† (Fig. S1–S3). The surface molar ratio estimated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy of Bi:V:W was 34:42:24.
Linear sweep voltammograms of the electrolyte solution in the presence and absence of 10 mM cyclohexene were measured using the BiVO4/WO3 photoelectrode (Fig. 2). In the absence of cyclohexene, the oxidation current was observed at +1.2 V vs. Ag/AgNO3 in the dark (Fig. 2, blue solid line). There was a noticeable shift to +0.2 V vs. Ag/AgNO3 with the application of simulated solar light irradiation (Fig. 2, red solid line). The redox potential measured for PINO/NHPI with a graphite disk electrode was +1.2 V vs. Ag/AgNO3 in MeCN (Fig. S3, ESI†). The oxidation potential in photo-electrochemical reactions was found to be much lower than the values often observed in conventional electrochemical reactions. In addition, the oxidation current increased slightly upon the addition of cyclohexene; this was probably due to the increase in the concentration of NHPI, which was regenerated in subsequent reactions between PINO and cyclohexene on the photoelectrode's surface (Fig. 2, dotted lines). These results indicated that the required applied bias for the oxidation of NHPI decreased due to the assistance from solar energy, and further supported the point that PINO/NHPI acted as an effective mediator for the oxidation of cyclohexene.
 Fig. 2  Linear sweep voltammograms in the presence (dotted line) and absence (solid line) of 10 mM cyclohexene in 10 mM NHPI and 100 mM LiClO4/MeCN. The electrolyte solution is 10 mL of 100 mM LiClO4/MeCN; the working electrode is BiVO4/WO3 (2 × 2 cm2); the counter electrode is a Pt mesh (80 mesh), whereas the reference electrode is Ag/AgNO3; the cell type is a one-compartment cell; red represents simulated solar light irradiation (calibrated to AM 1.5, 100 mW cm−2), whereas blue represents oxidation under dark conditions. 
The photo-electrochemical accumulation of PINO was conducted in a constant current mode (0.1 mA cm−2) with light irradiation. During photo-electrolysis, the colour of the electrolyte solution changed from colourless to yellow, and the absorbance intensity rose with every increasing charge passed through the system. A maximum absorption wavelength of 384 nm and a molar absorptivity of 1.48 × 103 M cm−1 were obtained (Fig. S4, ESI†). These were close to the values observed for PINO in previous reports (a maximum absorption wavelength of 380 nm and molar absorptivity of 1.46 × 103 M cm−1, respectively).17 These results strongly supported the theory that NHPI was predominantly oxidised and effectively accumulated as PINO during the initial step. The incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE, the apparent quantum efficiency to photocurrent) spectrum for the oxidation of NHPI is shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†). The maximum IPCE of 27% was obtained at a wavelength of 400 nm. It was found that the IPCE observed at shorter wavelengths decreased due to the absorption of the electrolyte solution and the FTO substrate.
Next, the PINO/NHPI-mediated in situ photo-electrolysis of cyclohexene (1) was examined in air (Fig. 3). Constant current photo-electrolysis (0.1 mA cm−2) of 1 was conducted both in the dark and with simulated solar light irradiation. The required applied bias for the oxidation of 1 to 2-cyclohexene-1-one (2) dramatically decreased from +2.4 V to +0.5 V vs. Ag/AgNO3 owing to light irradiation. The oxidation product 2 was obtained with an excellent Faraday efficiency (>99%) in the presence of NHPI. On the other hand, only a small amount of 2 was obtained when the reaction was conducted without NHPI. These results indicated that NHPI was selectively oxidised to cyclohexene to form 2. The Faraday efficiency for the oxidation of cyclohexene significantly improved with the use of a PINO/NHPI mediator.

The electrolyte solution is 30 mL of 100 mM LiClO4/MeCN (each compartment); the substrate is 10 mM of cyclohexene; the working electrode is BiVO4/WO3 (2 × 2 cm2); the counter electrode is a Pt mesh (80 mesh); the cell type is a two-compartment cell divided by a Nafion membrane; and the light source is a solar simulator (calibrated to AM 1.5, 100 mW cm−2). 
The constant current photo-electrolysis (0.1 mA cm−2) of cyclohexene 1 to generate 2 under O2 and N2 atmospheres was carried out using simulated solar light irradiation (Fig. 4). The oxidation current was noticeable in both cases. The yields of the oxidation product 2 were significantly lower, and the dimer (bi-2-cyclohexen-1-yl) was obtained as a by-product under atmospheric N2. On the other hand, 2 was obtained in larger quantities with a >99% Faraday efficiency under atmospheric O2. These results supported the idea that the oxidation of cyclohexene initially proceeded via a single electron transfer pathway to form cyclohexenyl hydroperoxide as previously reported.13 This was then disproportionated to form the same amount of alcohol and ketone, and then alcohol was further oxidised by PINO and/or the photoanode immediately to produce the oxidation product 2 (Scheme 1). Actually, a small amount of alcohol was detected during the reaction.

The electrolyte solution is 30 mL of 100 mM LiClO4/MeCN (each compartment); the substrate is 10 mM 1; the working electrode is BiVO4/WO3 (2 × 2 cm2); the counter electrode is a Pt mesh (80 mesh); the cell type is a two-compartment cell divided by a Nafion membrane; and the light source is a solar simulator (calibrated to AM 1.5, 100 mW cm−2). 
 Scheme 1  Possible mechanism for the oxidation of cyclohexene mediated by PINO/NHPI. 
To investigate the applicability of this indirect method, photo-electrochemical oxidation of other N-oxyl radical mediators and other cycloalkenes was conducted. As shown in Table 1, a variety of N-oxyl radical mediators can be engaged using this method with moderate to excellent Faraday efficiencies (entries 1–4). The use of TEMPO did not lead to improvements in these results because of its negative redox potential (entry 5). The oxidation of cyclopentene and cycloheptene was also achieved with 73% and 93% efficiency respectively, by using a PINO/NHPI mediator (entries 7 and 9). The effects of the photoanode semiconductor material were also studied under the same reaction conditions as shown in entry 1. The order of Faraday efficiencies obtained is BiVO4/WO3 (>99%) > Fe2O3 (78%) > WO3 (24%), as shown in Table S1 (ESI†). An Fe2O3 photoanode, which has a narrower band gap (2.1 eV) than BiVO4, can be utilised in these reactions to achieve relatively high Faraday efficiencies, whereas it was determined that the Faraday efficiency obtained on a WO3 photoanode was not good. It could be surmised that the moderate oxidation power of h+ on BiVO4, which has a more negative valence band position than Fe2O3 and WO3 photoanodes, may sufficiently prevent any undesirable side reactions.

In conclusion, we have successfully demonstrated a method for the selective photo-electrochemical oxidation of cycloalkenes to cycloalkenones with moderate to excellent Faraday efficiencies via PINO/NHPI mediators. The key feature of this method is that NHPI is predominantly oxidised on the BiVO4/WO3 photoanode surface in order to eliminate competing oxidation reactions from other reaction components such as the solvent and/or the electrolyte. Furthermore, a wide range of N-oxyl radicals and cycloalkenes could be engaged using this method, thus demonstrating the procedure's applicability in a variety of organic transformations.
