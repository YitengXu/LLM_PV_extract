    , Accepted 13th December 2014First published on 15th December 2014AbstractElectrostatically self-assembled multilayer films, which were formed using graphene oxide and a ruthenium complex, have been prepared. The films were characterized by UV-vis absorption spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy and cyclic voltammetry. The results indicated that the films were uniformly prepared and exhibited surface-confined metal-based redox behaviours. In addition, the films exhibited significant cathodic photocurrents that are better than the photocurrents observed for a phenylene-absent analogous Ru(II) complex-based thin film and a control film with a polyanion instead of GO. The mechanism of the enhanced cathodic photocurrent generation and the synergistically enhanced photocurrent are discussed. This thin film material could provide important insights for the development of more effective photoelectric conversion, as well as for photoelectrochemical catalytic and sensing devices.
1. Introduction
Since it was discovered in 2004, graphene, which is an extensively conjugated two-dimensional sp2-bonded carbon layer with one-atom thickness, has attracted tremendous attention due to its extraordinary thermal, mechanical and electrical properties, as well as its high charge-carrier mobility and optical transparency.1,2 The first key step towards its potential application is to fabricate homogeneous ultrathin films,3 which hold the potential for application in a wide range of areas, such as transparent and flexible conducting films, gas sensors, electrochemical energy storage devices, field effect transistors8 and super gas barriers.4–9
The electrostatic self-assembly (ESA) technique is a highly attractive and successful technique for fabricating thin films, due to its simplicity, versatility and high effectiveness in fabricating multilayer thin films with controllable thicknesses, architectures and functionalities on the molecular level, without limitations on the sizes and shapes of the solid supports.10,11 Graphene oxide (GO) prepared by the exfoliation of graphite oxide bears COOH/OH/epoxy oxygen-containing functional groups on its edges or basal planes.3 The highly hydrophilic and negatively charged surface makes GO advantageous over reduced graphene oxide and graphene for the formation of ESA films.3,12 GO has been reported to form ESA multilayer films with a variety of materials, including ionic polymers,12–15 inorganic nanomaterials,16,17 polyoxometalates18 and metal complexes.19–22 For example, ESA films composed of GO and a cationic polymer or polyethylenimine (PEI) have been reported by Fendler and Grunlan for potential applications in electrochemical and Li-ion batteries or as a super gas barrier.13–15 Using poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (PDDA) cationic polymer and a TiO2 nanosheet, Yu et al. reported a high-quality hybrid ESA film (PDDA/GO/PDDA/TiO2)20 with photoconductive switching properties.9 Loh et al. also reported a multilayer film composed of GO and TiO2 nanosheets with a PEI linker, where GO was UV light reduced by the TiO2, and the resulting multilayer exhibited ultrafast electron transfer and photoconversion properties.16 The ESA films based on GO and a Co–Al layered double hydroxide have been reported by Jin and co-workers as electrode materials for supercapacitors.17 Feng, Mullen and Bubeck et al. reported ESA films consisting of H3PW12O40 and GO with poly(allylamine hydrochloride) as the base film and PDDA as their interlayer linker, where the GO layer could be photoreduced by UV photocatalytic POM, and field effect transistors based on these composite films exhibited typical ambipolar features.18
Ru(II) polypyridyl complexes have attracted tremendous interest as key components in nanosized thin films with widespread applications, due to their strong visible light absorption, as well as unique photochemical, photophysical and redox properties.23,24 However, layer-by-layer multilayer films based on Ru(II) complexes and GO have not been extensively explored (see Fig. 1 for the molecular structures of Ru(II) complexes used for their ESA films with GO).19,20,22 Fendler and Mallouk and co-workers observed the rectifying properties of ITO/(PDDA/TiO2)10/(PDDA)/(GO/Ru1)30/Au at low voltages, where the low driven voltage was due to both the electronic and ionic conducting characteristics of GO.19 Recently, our group reported ESA multilayer films based on GO and Ru(II) polypyridyl complexes Ru2 and Ru3, and the 4-layer film (GO/Ru2)4 exhibited a significant photocurrent density of 4.4 μA cm−2. Variations in the structures and compositions of Ru(II) complexes can substantially affect their functionalities24 and perhaps tune the properties of their GO hybrid films.

2. Experimental section
2.1 Materials
(3-Aminopropyl)trimethoxysilane (99%) and poly(sodium-4-styrenesulfonate) (PSS, 70000 Mw) were purchased from Acros. Ru(II) complexes of Ru3(ClO4)2 and Ru4(ClO4)2 were synthesized according to previously published methods.25,26 GO was prepared from natural graphite using a modified Hummers' method.27 The raw GO was subjected to dialysis and exfoliation by ultrasonication, as previously described.20,22 The resulting GO was found to have a d-spacing of 0.72 nm as revealed by a strong X-ray diffraction peak at 2θ = 12.2°.
2.2 Instrumentation
Ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra were measured on a Cintra 10 e UV-vis spectrophotometer. X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were measured on an Axis Ultra X-ray photoelectron spectrometer from Thermo Fisher using Al Kα irradiation with an ESCA-250 system. For calibration, the C1s line was set at 286.4 eV as the standard. The surface morphologies of the deposited films were studied using scanning electron microscopy (SEM; Hitachi S-4800-II). All of the photoelectrochemical and cyclic voltammetry measurements were carried out at room temperature in 0.1 M aqueous Na2SO4 solution on a CHI electrochemical analyser using an indium-tin oxide (ITO) coated glass substrate modified with the self-assembled films, which had an effective area of 0.28 cm2, a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) and a Pt wire as the working, reference and counter electrodes, respectively. The polychromatic light irradiation (730 nm > λ > 325 nm) used for the photoelectrochemical studies was produced by a 500 W xenon lamp fitted with an infrared cut-off filter. The monochromatic light used for measuring the photocurrent action spectra was produced by a 500 W xenon lamp fitted with an infrared cut-off filter and additional narrow bandpass filters. The light intensities at each wavelength were measured using a ST-900M photometer. The distance between the lamp and the electrode was approximately 15 cm.
2.3 Preparation of the multilayer films
The thin film fabrication procedures, which are schematically shown in Fig. 2, are the same as those previously described, and the preparative details are given in the ESI.† The notation for the multilayer films (GO/Ru4)n stands for the n-time deposition of GO and Ru4(ClO4)2 or n-layer films on both sides of the substrates. As addressed below in the X-ray photoelectron spectra subsection, the perchlorate counter ion remained in the deposition solution, and only Ru42+ was deposited onto the GO-covered substrates.

3. Results and discussion
3.1 UV-vis absorption spectra
The depositions of GO and Ru4 onto the films were characterized by UV-vis absorption spectral comparisons of a 9-layer (GO/Ru4)9 film, GO and a Ru4(ClO4)2 aqueous solution (see Fig. 3). The GO aqueous solution exhibited a band at ∼227 nm, corresponding to the π → π* transition of the aromatic C–C bonds in GO.28 The Ru4(ClO4)2 aqueous solution exhibited an intraligand π → π* absorption band at 287 nm and a metal-to-ligand charge-transfer (MLCT) band at 463 nm. The (GO/Ru4)9 film exhibited the following spectral features: one shoulder at 231 nm, which coincides with the absorption feature of GO; two strong absorption bands centred at 293 and 470 nm, which were due to the Ru(II) complex, and these bands were blue shifted by 6 nm and 7 nm, respectively, compared to the absorption bands for the Ru4(ClO4)2 aqueous solution. The sequential deposition process of the SEA films was monitored by UV-vis absorption spectra, as shown in Fig. 4. The absorbance at 470 nm for the (GO/Ru4)n (n = 1–9) films grown layer-by-layer on both sides of a quartz substrate increased linearly with the layer number (n) (see Fig. 4 inset), with a correlation coefficient of 0.9982. These results indicated that an equal deposition amount of GO and Ru4 was observed with each deposition cycle with no interlayer molecular interaction. The Lambert–Beer Law was modified for the surface concentration of the chromophore of interest in the film, Γ (mol cm−2), i.e. Γ = 10−3D/ε,16 where D and ε are the mean absorbance per film layer on the single side of the quartz and the molar extinction coefficient (M−1 cm−1) of the chromophore in the film at a fixed wavelength, respectively. Based on the slope (0.0375) for the fitted straight line in the inset of Fig. 4, a D value of 0.0187 was determined. Assuming that the ε value at 470 nm for Ru4(ClO4)2 in the film was approximately equal to ε470nm = 16880 M−1 cm−1 for the complex in the aqueous solution, the surface concentration (Γ) of Ru4 in the film was determined to be 1.11 × 10−9 mol cm−2, which is very close to or over 2-fold larger than the Γ value of 1.14 × 10−9 or 3.6 × 10−10 mol cm−2 previously reported for Ru32+ or Ru22+ in their films.20,22 This result indicated that Ru3 and Ru4 have the same conformation and that their Ru(II) chromophores in their respective films are much more highly packed than those in the Ru2 film. However, the (GO/Ru4)n film exhibits approximately 10% less light-harvesting ability than (GO/Ru3)n based on their mean film absorbances per layer (0.0187 and 0.02, respectively). Because Ru3 and Ru4 (ref. 20) only differ by a phenalenyl group in Ru4, which was revealed by density functional theoretical calculations to be coplanar with the adjacent terpyridyl and imidazo[4,5-f][1,10]phenanthroline moieties,25 an electrostatic interaction between the negatively charged GO and the Ru(bpy)2 head group in Ru42+, rather than π–π stacking interactions between the π plane of GO and that of the main ligand of 2-(4-(2,6-di(pyridin-2-yl)pyridin-4-yl)phenyl)-1H-imidazo[4,5-f][1,10]phenanthroline in Ru4, dominates the interaction between GO and Ru4 in the film. If the π–π stacking interactions dominated their interaction, the extended planarity in Ru4 with respect to Ru3 would have resulted in a reduced surface concentration in the film. The subtle variations in the molecular structures of Ru3 and Ru4 provide further evidence for their conformation in the film and for the conclusion that π–π stacking and electrostatic interactions cannot be simultaneously optimized in the films of this family of Ru(II) complexes.

3.2 XPS study
A 4-layer (GO/Ru4)4 film was used as a representative film for studying the film chemical composition by XPS. As shown by the full-range (see Fig. 5a) and high-resolution Ru3d (see Fig. 5b) and C1s (see Fig. 5c) XPS peaks, the chloride ion characteristic peak was not observed, while the characteristic GO-based C1s and Ru4-based Ru3d photoelectron peaks were observed, indicating that the perchlorate ion of Ru4 remained in the deposition solution, although the small amount of the counter ion, which is below the detection limit of XPS, was likely to be attached in the film. In addition, the electrostatic attraction between Ru42+ and the negatively charged GO anion drives the thin film assembly process. Two characteristic photoelectron peaks at 280.9 eV and 284.9 eV, with a spin–orbit splitting of 4 eV, were due to Ru3d5/2 and Ru3d3/2, which are similar to those previously reported for the Ru(II) complexes of Ru3,20 [(bpy)2Ru(bpbh)Ru(bpy)2]4+ {where bpbh = 1,6-bis-[2-(2-pyridyl)benzimidazoyl]hexane, bpy = 2,2′-bipyridine},29 and [(acac)2Ru)2bptz]0 (acac = acetylacetonate, bptz = 3,6-bis-pyridyl-1,2,4,5-tetrazine)30 in solid thin films and powders. The C1s peak for the film was deconvoluted into four components centred at 284.6 eV, 286.6 eV, 288.4 eV and 285.3 eV. The first three peaks are quite similar to the three peaks observed for graphene oxide and correspond to the carbon atoms of CC (aromatic rings), carbon in C–O (epoxy and alkoxy) and CO (COOH), respectively.31 The last C1s peak was assigned to the CN of the RuII complex in the film.29 These results indicate that Ru4 and GO were successfully assembled in the film.

3.3 Scanning electron microscopy
Previously, we observed a relatively substantial difference in the surface morphologies of (GO/Ru3)3GO and (GO/Ru3)4, which consist of GO and Ru3, respectively, as the outmost layers. The surface morphology of (GO/Ru3)4 is in contrast to those of (GO/Ru3)3GO and bare ITO. Due to overlapping of the corrugated soft and flexible GO sheets, many varying shapes and sizes of grains or islands and some defects or pinholes appear on the surface of bare ITO.20 However, when the more bulky Ru4 was used instead of Ru3, the differences between the surface morphologies between (GO/Ru4)3GO and (GO/Ru4)4 became more obvious (see Fig. S1, ESI†). In particular, the bumps and wrinkles on the surface of (GO/Ru4)3GO became smaller, and the surface of (GO/Ru4)4 became less flat.
3.4 Cyclic voltammetry
The redox properties of the ITO/(GO/Ru4)1 monolayer film in a 0.1 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution were first examined by cyclic voltammetry, as shown in Fig. S2.† One pair of quasi-reversible redox peaks with a half-wave potential {E1/2 = (Epa + Epc)/2} of 1.16 V vs. SCE was observed, which correspond to the metal-based RuII/RuIII redox reaction.19 However, the inset in Fig. S2† shows the non-linear dependence of the cathodic peak currents with scanning rates from 0.2 V s−1 to 0.8 V s−1, which was caused by the film peeling off during the potential scanning and poor film redox reversibility. The charge transport ability of the multilayers was examined by the CVs of varying layer numbers of films (see Fig. S3†), and it was found that the anodic peak currents increased with increasing layer number, up to at least 6 layers, indicating that GO is a good mediator for electron transport. These characteristics are similar to those previously observed for ITO/(Ru3/GO)n films. In this study, the redox and heterogeneous electron transfer dynamic properties of ITO/(Ru4/GO)n films in a CH2Cl2 solution containing 0.1 M Bu4NPF6 were studied in detail. As shown in Fig. 6, the anodic peak currents linearly increase with increasing potential scan rates up to 0.8 V s−1, rather than exhibiting a square root dependence on the scan rates. This result indicates that the redox reaction was a surface-confined process rather than a diffusion controlled process, as expected from the adsorbed redox species in a thin-layer cell based on eqn (1)32 iP = [(nF)2AΓν]/(4RT)(1)where n, Γ, F, ν and A represent the number of electrons involved in the electrode reaction, the surface concentration (mol cm−2), Faraday's constant (96485 C mol−1), the potential scan rate (V s−1) and the electrode area (cm2), respectively. According to eqn (1), the surface concentration of Ru4 on the ITO electrode was determined to be 1.24 × 10−10 mol cm−2 at a scan rate of 0.2 V s−1. Apparently, the surface concentration derived from eqn (1) is approximately one order of magnitude less than that derived from the UV-vis spectroscopy. The origins of this discrepancy are as follows: (1) some Ru4 molecules on the ITO electrode surface are not electrochemically active; (2) Ru4 exhibits a poor film-forming ability on ITO compared to quartz, due to the poor hydrophilicity of the former compared to the latter; (3) UV-vis spectroscopy assumes that the molar absorptivities of Ru4 in the film and the solution are the same, and (4) Ru4 is partially peeled off from the electrode surface during the CV scans. For the ITO/(Ru4/GO)n films, a linear dependence of the cathodic peak currents on the scan rates was observed up to a lower scan rate of 0.5 V s−1, and a 1.8-fold lower surface concentration (6.76 × 10−11 mol cm−2) was derived for the ITO/(Ru3/GO)n films at a potential scan of 0.2 V s−1. Fig. 7 shows the non-linear effects of the logarithm of the high potential scan rates over ν > 1 V s−1 for the overpotential, as defined by Ep − Eo, where Ep is the peak potential value for the anodic or cathodic wave and Eo is the formal potential taken as the average of the anodic (Epa) and cathodic (Epc) peak potentials at a slow scan rate. According to Laviron's theory,33 the value of the rate constant (ks) for the electron transfer from the complex to ITO is determined based on eqn (2) and (3): (2) (3)where F is Faraday's constant, n is the number of electrons, α is the electron transfer coefficient, and νa and νc are the critical scan rates that were obtained from intercepts of the straight line fit to the anodic and cathodic data, respectively. The ks value for the ITO/(GO/Ru4)1 film was determined to be 13.3 s−1 using α = 0.5 and νa = νc = 0.684. A smaller ks value (i.e. 11.9 s−1) for the ITO/(GO/Ru3)1 film was determined using α = 0.35, νa = 0.460 and νc = 0.852 (see Fig. S4 and S5†). The ks values for the ITO/(GO/Ru4 or Ru3)1 films were moderate compared to the smaller ks values of 3.1 s−1 and 1.9 s−1 or the larger values of 185.3–443.3 s−1, which were previously reported for a dinuclear Ru complex-based solvent-casted film,34 or an electropolymerized Ni(II) complex on a glassy carbon electrode, and for a Langmuir–Blodgett film of [Ru(bpy)2(ndbpy)]2+(bpy = 2,2′-bipyridine and ndbpy = 4,4′-dinonadecyl-2,2′-bipyridine) on a SnO2 electrode, and for Ru(II) complex-based self-assembled films on an ITO electrode.35–37

3.5 Photoelectrochemistry
A three-electrode photoelectrochemical cell (PECC) was used as a configuration-simplified, prototype cell of a dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC), which typically consists of a dye-sensitized ITO electrode, as well as a platinum and saturate calomel electrode as the working, counter and reference electrodes, respectively. PECCs do not exhibit performance as optimally as DSSCs, but the use of PECCs allows us to gain insights into the structure–performance relationships of photoelectric conversion and electrocatalytic mechanisms and to more efficiently and expediently evaluate or screen materials compared to DSSCs.38 The solar energy photoelectric properties of the hybrid films consisting of GO and Ru4 were studied using a photoelectrochemical technique. As shown in Fig. 8, when irradiated with 100 mW cm−2 of white light (730 nm > λ > 325 nm) and biased at −0.4 V vs. SCE, a monolayer ITO/(GO/Ru4)1 film exhibited a significant cathodic photocurrent (photocurrent density) of 2.08 μA (7.43 μA cm−2). This result is more than 4-fold larger than the photocurrent for Ru4-free monolayer GO-covered ITO (i.e. only 0.4 μA (1.43 μA cm−2)) and the negligible photocurrent responses for the bare ITO electrode. In addition, this result is even greater than the photocurrents (photocurrent densities) previously reported for Ru(II) complex-based thin films (e.g. 1.57 μA (5.61 μA cm−2) for an analogous Ru(II) complex film (i.e. ITO/(GO/Ru3)1),20 0.762 μA (2.72 μA cm−2) for a covalently self-assembled thin film based on a bis-terpyridyl Ru(II) complex of [RuII(IPTP)2]2+ (in which IPTP = 4′-(4-(imidazol-1-yl)phenyl)-2,2′:6′,2′′-terpyridine),39 and 0.400 μA (1.43 μA cm−2) for a 4-layer ESA film based on [Ru2(bpy)2(L)]2+ {where L = 1,2-bis(2-(4-(1H-imidazo[4,5-f][1,10]phenanthrolin-2yl)phenoxy)ethoxy)ethane} and tungstophosphoric acid).40 Stable and prompt photocurrent responses were generated reversibly and repeatedly under on/off cycles of irradiation. This behaviour is in contrast to the much slower and weaker photocurrent responses previously reported for an ESA film of polymerized Ru(II) complex with [S2Mo18O62]4−.41 It is important to note that when a polyanion of PSS was used instead of GO, the ITO/(PSS/Ru4)1 electrode exhibited a much lower photocurrent (photocurrent density) of 0.23 μA (0.821 μA cm−2), indicating that GO acted as a good electron shuttle to transport electrons from ITO to the Ru4 layer, while the photocurrent was synergistically enhanced as Ru4 and GO were introduced into the film. To further validate the photocurrent polarity, the effects of bias voltages on the photocurrents were studied, and the results are shown in Fig. 9. The cathodic photocurrents increased when the bias voltages became more negative from +0.1 V to −0.4 V vs. SCE, indicating that the electrons were transferred from the modified ITO to the electrolyte solution. The enhanced photocurrents resulted from the increases in the conduction band level of the ITO electrode: the conduction band level increased with the increasing negative bias potentials to the electrode, and thus the bigger energy gap between the conduction band and the HOMO of Ru4 accelerated the photoinduced separation or induced the formation of the charge separation. In the above-mentioned electron transfer process, the electrons were shuttled by the ESA film modified on ITO. This directional electron transfer may be promoted and inhibited by the presence of electron acceptors and donors, respectively. Indeed, the additions of electron donors (i.e. hydroquinone) (see Fig. S6†) and electron acceptors (i.e. K3Fe(CN)6) (see Fig. S7†) into the electrolyte solution resulted in a reduction and enhancement of the photocurrents, respectively. In addition, the cathodic photocurrents were reduced when nitrogen was bubbled into the electrolyte solution for 10 min to remove oxygen in the electrolyte solution (see Fig. S8†), because the molecular oxygen acted as an electron acceptor in the solution, accepting an electron to form a superoxide anion and enhancing the electron transport from the ITO/(GO/Ru4)1 film to the electrolyte solution. A plot of the photocurrents of ITO/(GO/Ru4)n films (n = 1–6) biased at −0.2 V vs. SCE vs. the number of deposited layers (n) is shown in Fig. S9,† where the cathodic photocurrents slowly increased with increasing n up to 3 layers, which resulted in a maximum photocurrent (photocurrent density) of 0.81 μA (2.89 μA cm−2).

Bottom panel: dependence of the photocurrent of ITO/(GO/Ru4)1 film on the applied potential upon irradiation with 100 mW cm−2 white light. 
The photocurrent action spectrum, which is a plot of the incident monochromatic photo-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) of the ITO/(GO/Ru4)4 film as a function of the incident wavelength is shown in Fig. S10,† and the IPCE values were calculated according to eqn (4)42 (4)where I is the produced photocurrent density and Pinc is the incident light power at a given wavelength λ. The spectrum matches with the visible absorption spectrum for the multilayer film with the IPCE peak position the same as the maximum absorption position at 460 nm, indicating that the photocurrents observed result from the photoexcited complex of Ru4*. A maximum IPCE value of 0.040% at 460 nm was achieved for the ITO/(GO/Ru4)4 film, which was slightly larger than the IPCE value of 0.035% previously reported for an ITO/(GO/Ru3)4 film.20 Regardless of the weaker light-harvesting ability and comparable surface concentration of Ru4 with respect to Ru3 in the thin films, ITO/(GO/Ru4)1 exhibited a strong photocurrent generation and photoelectric conversion efficiency, which may be due to a more rapid electron transfer rate, which was revealed by the scan rate-dependent cyclic voltammetry results of the former film compared to the latter film, and also a potentially favourable interfacial morphology, which is not well understood.
These results confirm that the (GO/Ru4)n films generated cathodic photocurrents, with Ru4 being the major light harvesting dye. The mechanism of the cathodic photocurrent generation and the energy level arrangements for the species relating to the photocurrent generation are shown in Fig. 10. With a 0–0 transition energy E00 (E00 = 1240/λonset) value of 2.41 eV (the onset absorption band edge for Ru42+, λonset, is located at 515 nm) and a ground-state oxidation half-wave potential E1/2(Ru43+/Ru42+) value of +1.16 V vs. SCE (+1.40 V vs. standard hydrogen electrode SHE), an excited state oxidation half-wave potential E1/2(Ru43+/Ru42+*) value of −1.25 V vs. SCE (−1.01 V vs. SHE) was estimated using eqn (5). E1/2(Ru43+/Ru42+*) = E1/2(Ru43+/Ru42+) – E00(5)
 Fig. 10  The mechanism of cathodic photocurrent generation. 
The energy level of the conduction band of the ITO electrode, the working function value of GO, the reduction potentials of O2 and K3Fe(CN)6, and the oxidation potential of H2Q are +0.2 (4.7 eV below the vacuum level),43 +0.3 (4.8 eV below the vacuum level), and −0.26 V,44 +0.36 V (ref. 45) and +1.1 V (ref. 46) vs. NHE, respectively. As shown in Fig. 10, the cathodic photocurrent is most likely produced via the following thermodynamically favourable electron transport cascade: the ground-state Ru42+ was first photoexcited as Ru42+*, during which an electron was promoted from the HOMO to the LUMO; the excited electron was then transferred to the electron acceptors (i.e. O2 or K3Fe(CN)6) in the electrolyte solution, which resulted in oxidized Ru43+ and Ru42+ being regenerated by a sequential electron transfer from ITO to GO to the empty HOMO of Ru43+, completing the electron transfer cycle. Apparently, the H2Q electron donor that is present in the electrolyte solution could quench the excited Ru42+* by giving its electron to the empty LUMO of Ru42+*, which results in a decrease in the cathodic photocurrents.
4. Conclusions
A layer-by-layer film consisting of a Ru(II) complex (i.e. Ru4) and GO was uniformly deposited onto hydrophilic quartz and ITO supports in a convenient and repetitive way. The thin films of (GO)/Ru4)n exhibited quasi-reversible Ru(III)/Ru(II) associated redox waves with surface-confined characteristics. Ru4 and an analogous Ru(II) complex (i.e.Ru3) differ only by a phenylene group. However, the Ru4-based film (i.e. (GO)/Ru4)n) exhibited a significant cathodic photocurrent, which was better than that of ((GO)/Ru3)n, and which was due to the more rapid electron transfer rate and different surface morphologies, regardless of the better light-harvesting ability of the former compared to the latter. Both GO and Ru4 exhibited weak photocurrent generation, but as Ru4 was deposited onto GO, an enhanced photocurrent was observed compared to the photocurrent observed for a control film (PSS/Ru4) with a polyanion of PPS as an alternative to GO. This synergistically enhanced photocurrent generation is due to the good electron transport ability, which is supported by the favourable energy level alignment between each interface. This study provides important insights for further application of this interesting hybrid thin film in photoelectric conversion, as well as in photoelectrocatalytic and photoelectrochemical sensing fields.
