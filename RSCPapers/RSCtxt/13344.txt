    , Accepted 20th January 2011First published on 22nd February 2011AbstractMonodisperse quaternary chalcopyrite Cu2CoSnS4 colloidal quantum dots have been synthesized by acid peptization of a tailored Cu2CoSnS4 precursor displaying loosely packed, ultrafine primary crystallites. Well-defined peaks shifted to higher energy compared to the Cu2CoSnS4 bulk band gap value were observed on the UV-Vis absorption curve consistent with a quantum confinement behavior. First investigations by room temperature time resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectroscopy suggest that the photoluminescence emission does not arise from a donor–acceptor recombination.
Introduction

        Chalcopyrite semiconductors have attracted intense interest within the past 25 years owing to their appropriate band gap (CuInS2, CIS, 1.5 eV, CuInSe2 1.1 eV) well matching the AM0 solar spectrum.1,2 High efficiencies close to 20% have been achieved on solar cells based on these materials. Recently,3,4 the quaternary chalcopyrite compound Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) which contains only abundant and non-toxic elements has become the subject of intense interest because it is an ideal absorber candidate material for thin film solar cells5 with an optimal band gap (1.5 eV) and high absorption coefficient (>104 cm−1). The reported energy conversion efficiency of CZTS-based solar cells has increased from 0.66% to close to 10% very recently.4 CZTS possess a crystal structure which is analogous to the chalcopyrite type semiconductors such as CuInGaS2 and belongs to an entire class of quaternary materials including Cu2ZnSnS4, Cu2CoSnS4, Cu2FeSnS4.6 To improve its performance, new design concepts have been implemented increasing these materials' efficiencies to values exceeding that of single gap solar cells. Intermediate band solar cells7 were recently proposed consisting in the introduction of impurity levels in the middle of the semiconductor band gap allowing for the absorption of additional lower energy photons. In this context, quantum dot (QD) arrays provide the intermediate band of discrete states that allow sub-band gap energies to be absorbed. Chalcopyrite QDs were reported as promising materials for photovoltaic devices since they offer many advantages such as high absorption coefficient, structural defect tolerance, insensitivity to radiation damages.8 Thus, chalcopyrite QDs have been proposed as candidates for Si-based intermediate band solar devices.9 However, only a few reports10,11 concerning the synthesis of quaternary chalcopyrite nanocrystals have been published to date. CZTS nanocrystals were for instance synthesized by high temperature-arrested precipitation in the coordinating solvent oleyamine (OLA). The particles are crystalline and have an average diameter of 10 nm or 15–20 nm with band gap energy, determined from the absorbance spectra, respectively of 1.3 eV and 1.5 eV suggesting no quantum confinement effects for the synthesized nanocrystals.10,11 In addition, to further improve the efficiency of the quaternary chalcopyrite QD-based solar cells, it is crucial to understand the optical properties of these building blocks. Indeed, only a few reports12–14 describe the optical properties of quaternary chalcopyrites. These investigations have only dealt with CZTS bulk materials such as thin film prepared by sol-gel and sulfurization method, as well as bulk single crystal.
Here, we report on a novel approach to the synthesis of monodisperse chalcopyrite Cu2CoSnS4 semiconductors QDs. Cu2CoSnS4 QDs were synthesized without the use of any high selectivity coordinating ligand or coordinating solvent. Our process route includes, in a first step, the preparation of a precursor displaying a unique Cu2CoSnS4 structure and possessing low primary crystallite size, loosely packed. In a second step, the formation of Cu2CoSnS4 quantum dots was achieved by acid peptisation. Absorption spectra collected on Cu2CoSnS4 QDs dispersions synthesized without coordinating surface species clearly displays two well-resolved peaks in the UV-visible spectral region. Optical properties of these quantum dots were fully investigated by stationary (PL) and time resolved (TRPL) photoluminescence spectroscopy.
Experimental section
Preparation of Cu2CoSnS4 Precursor
A typical procedure of Cu2CoSnS4 precursor synthesis follows 9 mmol of CuCl2·2H2O, 4.5 mmol of CoCl2·6H2O, 4.5 mmol of SnCl4·5H2O and 180 mL of absolute ethanol mixed at room temperature. Once the metal salts were completely dissolved, 45 mmol CS(NH2)2 were added, then 3.85 mL of TMaOH 25% in MeOH were injected. After 10 mn, 9 mmol of ascorbic acid were incorporated into the reaction mixture which was adjusted to 240 mL with ethanol. The resulting mixture was transferred into a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave with a capacity of 600 mL and heated at 200 °C and maintained for 16 h. After cooling, the suspension was centrifuged at 3500 rpm resulting in a solid pellet P and a supernatant which was eliminated. For the characterization of the precursor, the solid pellet was washed with ethanol and dried at room temperature.
Preparation of Cu2CoSnS4 Quantum Dots by Peptisation
The solid pellet P previously described was directly re-dispersed after centrifugation at room temperature in an ethanol solution containing 2 M acetic acid. Peptisation was performed by keeping the suspension under continuous stirring for about 16 h at room temperature. Size selective precipitation was achieved by centrifugation at 3500 rpm. The colloidal sol obtained was further subjected to acetic acid removal involving precipitation of solid by hexane addition, centrifugation and re-dispersion in ethanol. Orange-red colloidal Cu2CoSnS4 quantum dots dispersions in ethanol were thus obtained after several washing steps.
Measurements

Elemental analysis (ICP-OES) was performed by Service Central d'analyses, CNRS, Solaize, France. High resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images were taken using a JEOL 1011 operating at 100 kV in bright field mode. A LabRAM HR 800, Jobin Yvon Raman spectrometer was used to record Raman spectra. The spectral resolution of the monochromator was about 1 cm−1. For optimum signal-to-noise ratio, we selected the red line of the He–Ne laser with an excitation wavelength λ = 632.82 nm and an excitation power PHe–Ne = 1.7 mW.

Optical absorption spectra were recorded on a VARIAN Carry 10 spectrophotometer. Cuvettes used for the experiments are made of Suprasil quartz from Hellma Analytics. In order to avoid artifacts, the cuvettes contribution to the absorption has been systematically subtracted from the raw data. Continuous wave photoluminescence spectra were recorded on a Acton Spectra Pro 2500 I spectrofluorometer equipped with an Ar+ ion laser (λ = 351 nm, Newport Beam lock Ae 2065-7S) or a GaN diode laser (λ = 405 nm, Nichia NLHV 3000E). Measurements were performed on nanocrystals solutions, placed in 1-cm quartz cuvettes. Time-resolved photoluminescence was performed using a frequency-tripled mode-locked Ti-saph laser with 1.2 ps pulse duration and 80 MHz repetition frequency, at a wavelength λ = 290 nm and average power Paver = 1–10 mW, focussed to a 50 µm diameter spot. The PL dynamics is recorded with a S20 photocathode Hamamatsu synchroscan Steak Camera C5680 with 8 ps overall time resolution.
Results and discussion

          Cu2CoSnS4 Precursors

          Cu2CoSnS4 nano-crystals were prepared from a surfactant-free route using solvothermal synthesis. Our process involves in a first step, the preparation of a Cu2CoSnS4 precursor possessing loosely packed ultrafine primary crystallites. Formation domains of samples exhibiting a unique Cu2CoSnS4 structure by XRD (Fig. 1) were investigated by variation of [S]/[Cu] and [OH]/[Cu] where [S] denotes for the total concentration of sulfur species in the reaction solution and [OH] for the base concentration. Cu2CoSnS4 formation domain was investigated in the range of OH/Cu ratios corresponding to the partial neutralization of the metallic cations. Formation of a unique ternary chalcopyrite Cu2CoSnS4 structure is observed in a large domain. It is worth noting that, for reaction mixtures prepared at higher OH/Cu ratios, formation of the Cu2CoSnS4 structure is only achieved in high-sulfide concentration medium. Alternately, highly super-saturated conditions were classically defined by variation of reaction temperature and duration. A crucial parameter for adjusting the super-saturation is the ascorbic acid addition which increases [Cu+], resulting in a significant decrease of Cu2CoSnS4 XRD domain size. In ethanol as solvent, a loose packing of the primary crystallites was achieved through a fine tuning of [OH] concentration. Thus, typical conditions for preparation of precursor displaying a unique Cu2CoSnS4 structure with ultrafine primary crystallites, loosely packed was (Cu:Co:Sn:S:OH) = (2.0:1.0:1.0:10:2). Synthesis at 200 °C for 16 h yields primary crystallite size, calculated using Scherrer's equation on (112) XRD peak, of 6 nm. This primary crystallite size value was confirmed by high resolution TEM images recorded of this sample showing particles formed by aggregation of primary crystallite of 3–6 nm. Typical chemical composition of the precursor determined by chemical analysis shows a Co deficient composition (Cu:Co:Sn:S) = (2.0:0.77:0.96:3.91). A Raman investigation was undertaken to understand deviations from stoichiometry. As a reference, a highly crystalline Cu2CoSnS4 sample was synthesized following a procedure previously described.15 The high temperature sample synthesized at 500 °C displays a main peak at 327 cm−1 and secondary peaks observed at 302 cm−1 and 350 cm−1. Compared with values reported in the literature for Cu2ZnSnS4 and Cu2FeSnS4,16 our assignments for Cu2CoSnS4 are consistent with the previous findings of Koschell et al.17 Indeed, they predicted that in the closely related chalcopyrites the totally symmetric vibration is found near 300 cm−1 and hardly varies since it is a motion of the sulfur atoms alone. Raman spectra recorded on Cu2CoSnS4 precursor samples (Fig. 2) consist of a broad peak located in the range of 200–400 cm−1. Three peaks, shifted at lower energies (285 cm−1, 315 cm−1 and 337 cm−1) were observed after de-convolution of this broad peak. Since small variations in frequencies were observed for these three lines compared with those determined on bulk samples, further investigation is under progress to better define contributions of parameters such as quantum confinement or deviations to stoichiometric composition to account for the origin of the observed small variations in peak energy of our nano-crystallites. We can conclude from all these observations that the formation of a Cu2CoSnS4 precursor with small deviations from stoichiometric composition can be ascribed to the presence of some amorphous phase.

Quantum Dots

Electrostatic stabilization by acid peptization18,19 is largely employed for the fabrication of colloidal nanocrystals. The colloidal dispersions we prepared at 1 g L−1 were shown to be stable towards decantation for more than 6 months.

HRTEM observation shows a fairly monodispersed population of nanoparticles without significant aggregation (Fig. 3). Fine inspection of the TEM images indicates particles displaying a spherical morphology with an average diameter of 3 ± 1 nm. A similar composition (Cu:Co:Sn:S) = (2.00:0.69:0.90:3.42) compared to those determined for the precursor was established by chemical analysis of the colloidal dispersion although some samples may exhibit a more deficient copper composition. Because of the ultra-thin size of the nanoparticles, chemical heterogeneities were investigated using EDS-TEM performed with a local probe as small as 5 nm. All our investigations did not show a measurable presence of SnS2, CoS or CuxS nanocrystals.

Optical Properties of Cu2CoSnS4 Quantum Dots
Optical properties of the nano-crystals were investigated using room temperature photoluminescence and UV-Vis-NIR absorption spectroscopy. The absorption spectrum (Fig. 4) recorded on the Cu2CoSnS4 nano-crystal dispersions shows two well-resolved peaks, observed at 400 nm (3.10 eV) and 480 nm (2.58 eV). The room temperature photoluminescence spectra recorded on the same dispersions are also plotted and exhibit, as well, two well-resolved peaks at 430 nm (2.88 eV) and 560 nm (2.21 eV). It is worth noting that those two peaks are observed using two different excitation wavelengths (351 nm and 290 nm) in the UV range.

In contrast to CdS20 or InP21 semiconductor QDs, numerous studies performed on chalcopyrite QDs (CIS) invariably show a lack of a distinct exciton peak in the absorption spectrum.22–25 The absorption spectra of the CIS dispersions exhibited a broad shoulder with a long tail to lower energies both significantly shifted from the bulk band gap absorption of CIS. Several factors were proposed to account for this undistinguishable peak such as a more important composition variation for ternary compounds, a very large size distribution, an electron density leakage from the core of the nanocrystals into the organic ligand surface layer, or the presence of intraband states (defect states).

Absorption spectra recorded on our Cu2CoSnS4 nanocrystal dispersions, composed of nanocrystals possessing a monodisperse size distribution and non-capping surfaces clearly exhibit distinct exciton peaks. Fig. 5 demonstrates that these peaks cannot be ascribed to soluble species formed from the reaction solution. Indeed, spectra recorded on the supernatant of the reaction solution after precursor solvothermal synthesis did not show the two distinct peaks. Since these well-defined peaks on the absorption spectra were observed on Cu2CoSnS4 colloids whose precursors were synthesized at a relatively low temperature T = 200 °C, we anticipate the presence of a large concentration of defects in our nanocrystals, yielding intraband states. However, as shown by our results, the presence of intraband states is not critical to the observation of these distinct peaks in the absorption spectra.

For reference, the bulk band gap energy of Cu2CoSnS4 was determined on a highly crystalline Cu2CoSnS4 that we synthesized following a previously described procedure.15 A value Egap = 1.5 eV similar to the bulk band gap of a closely related material Cu2ZnSnS4 was obtained. Hence, compared with the bulk band gap value, we observed for the Cu2CoSnS4 nanocrystals a significant blue shift in the peak energies of the UV-Vis absorption spectra. This shift of the absorption peaks energy to higher values is consistent with a quantum confinement effect.

PL spectra exhibited two well-defined peaks, observed at lower energies than absorption peaks with shift values varying from 30 to 80 nm. With the objective of better understanding the transitions involved in these peaks, the PL excitation power dependence was investigated on the Cu2CoSnS4 QDs (not shown). No significant modification of the spectra was observed in the power range from 1 to 10 mW. Indeed, an alternative interpretation consists in assigning the two PL peaks to the radiative recombination of the ground and excited state in a given size and composition QD.26 We rule out this interpretation since we do not observe any variation of the relative intensity of the two peaks when the excitation intensity increases. Thus, we believe that these two peaks do not involve transitions occurring in the same chemical compound but it rather suggests transitions occurring either from two populations possessing different mean sizes or from different chemical compounds. Note that two different chemical compounds can develop a same size or be coupled in a core-shell type structure.
Because the TEM examination shows a fairly monodisperse size distribution, we can conclude that these two peaks probably arise from the presence of two different chemical compounds. Since the presence of Cu2CoSnS4 (Eg = 1.5 eV) was clearly identified both by XRD and Raman spectroscopy, one of the two peaks could be assigned to the quaternary chalcopyrite. Probable material candidates for the second peak could be CoS (Eg = 0.90 eV), CuxS (Eg = 1.8–2.4 eV), SnS2 (Eg = 2.35 eV), SnO2 (Eg = 3.8 eV) or Cu2SnS3. Indeed, no experimental value is available for the quantum shift resulting from a 3 nm mean diameter Cu2CoSnS4 nanoparticle. Nevertheless, a good estimation of the quantum shift can be obtained from values previously reported for the CIS chalcopyrite displaying similar structure and optical properties. For CIS QDs, various PL peak energy ranging from 450 nm22 (2.75 eV) to 750 nm23 (1.65 eV) were reported for 3 nm CIS nanoparticles. From these observations, we propose that the low energy transition could be attributed to Cu2CoSnS4 QDs. Our preliminary experiments on Cu2FeSnS4 QDs have shown similar characteristics of the absorption and PL spectra demonstrating that the high energy peak do not involve Fe or Co elements, and thus suggesting that the high energy transition could be assigned to materials such as CuxS or SnS2.
Another important feature is the Stokes shift of 30–80 nm observed between the spectra recorded on the Cu2CoSnS4 QDs. Note that typical Stokes shift of 100 nm23 and 246 meV25 were reported in CIS QDs. For a reminder, the origin of luminescence recombination was previously attributed to donor–acceptor pair recombination in Cu2ZnSnS4 bulk single crystals13 which possess a structure close to Cu2CoSnS4. Indeed, Cu2CoSnS4 has a complex defect chemistry because of the variation in ([Cu]/[Co] + [Sn]), [Co]/[Sn] and [S]/[Cu] ratios. Probable intrinsic defects in Cu2CoSnS4 crystals are CuCo, VCu, CoSn, VCo, CoCu, SnCo,26, 27 and excess or deficient sulfur occupancy. Cu2CoSnS4 crystals with a high concentration of defects may not exhibit band edge luminescence. Two groups of emission peaks could be observed in the literature for CIS and CZTS materials. A first group involves donor-to-valence band emission, observed in sulfur deficient crystals. It results from a recombination of an electron at a sulfur vacancy or either at a cobalt–copper substitution site with the valence band. A second group of peaks involves the recombination between donor states with acceptor states. This latter type of recombination is observed in CuInS2 or Cu2ZnSnS4 samples. To better understand the transitions involved in our quantum dots, TRPL measurements were performed on films made from Cu2CoSnS4 quantum dots. Fig. 6 shows the representative PL decay curves of the Cu2CoSnS4 nanocrystals which were probed at different excitation powers. The long tail of the PL decay curve of each power excitation can be fitted by a single exponential function I(t) = A1exp(–t/τ1) where τ1 represents the decay time of the PL emission and A1 represents the amplitude of the decay components at t = 0. A short decay time τ1 = 2.8 ns was determined from the curves at room temperature. Thus shorter decay times are determined in our QDs, in contrast to values up to 300 ns, reported for CuInS2 chalcopyrites nanocrystals synthesized with the use of surfactants.25 These observations suggest that the observed PL Stokes shift does not arise from a donor–acceptor pair (DAP) recombination. Another origin of such an important PL Stokes shift can be found in the size distribution of the QDs even in the presence of intrinsic transitions as observed by Micic et al.28 However, in order to precisely determine the origin of the PL emission further experimental work is needed at cryogenic temperatures.

Conclusions
A novel process route for the synthesis of monodisperse colloidal Cu2CoSnS4 quantum dots has been developed without the use of any capping surface additive or coordinating solvent. Although a large concentration of defect exists in these nanocrystals prepared at relatively low temperature, distinct exciton peaks were clearly observed in the absorption spectra.
Corresponding PL spectra exhibited two well-defined peaks, observed at lower energies than absorption peaks. Investigations by stationary (PL) and time resolved (TRPL) photoluminescence spectroscopy demonstrate that these two peaks could not be assigned to the radiative recombination of the ground and excited state in a given size and composition QD but rather suggest transitions occurring either from two populations possessing different mean sizes or from different chemical compounds. Our observations also suggest that the observed PL Stokes shift does not arise from a donor–acceptor pair (DAP) recombination.
