    , Accepted 26th October 2022First published on 26th October 2022AbstractTransition metal phosphides are a new class of materials that have attracted enormous attention as a potential electrode for supercapacitors (SCs) compared to metal oxides/hydroxides and metal sulfides due to their strong redox-active behaviour, good electrical conductivity, layered structure, low cost, and high chemical and thermal stability. Recently, several efforts have been made to develop nickel phosphides (NixPy) (NPs) for high-performance SCs. The electrochemical properties of NPs can be easily tuned by several innovative approaches, such as heteroatom doping, defect engineering, and developing a hollow architecture. The prospects of NPs as a positive electrode in hybrid SCs are summarized to understand the material's practical relevance. Finally, the challenges and perspectives are provided for the development of high-performance NPs for SCs. The thorough elucidation of the structure–property–performance relationship offers a guide for developing NP-based next-generation energy-storage devices.Satyajeet S. PatilMr Satyajeet S.

1. Introduction
The rapid evolution of the electronic industry with increased urbanization demands high electrical energy to support day-to-day life.1 Thus, clean, cost-effective, and sustainable energy sources along with energy-storage systems are critically important. Currently, fuel cells, batteries, and supercapacitors (SCs) are used for electrochemical energy storage. Among these, batteries2,3 and SCs4,5 have captured a broad share of the commercial market due to their high power and energy density, long cycle life, fast charge and discharge rate, cost-effectiveness, easy maintenance, and ecofriendly nature. These energy-storage systems help to power smartphones, laptops, digital cameras, tablets, wearable devices etc. as electronic devices that are widely used in our routine life.6–10 SCs are considered the most promising and trending energy-storage devices due to their rapid charge–discharge rates, high efficiency, reliability, and long-term cycling stability compared to batteries.11–13
SCs have a high power density but poor energy density; in contrast, batteries have a high energy density but low power density. The basic idea of a hybrid supercapacitor (HSC) is to overcome the challenges of batteries and SCs by utilizing their promising features in a single device.14–16 The hybrid configuration consists of battery-type pseudocapacitive and capacitive electrodes that offer excellent electrochemical performance in terms of energy density, rapid kinetics, and a good lifespan and reliability.17 The electrochemical signature of an HSC with the electrochemical characteristics of their respective electrodes is presented in Fig. 1.15

Traditional electric double-layer capacitors (EDLCs), which store charge through electrostatic adsorption/desorption at the electrode/electrolyte interface (i.e., a non-faradaic process), can deliver superior power compared to pseudocapacitors (PCs). EDLCs typically comprise carbon-based materials, and show an energy-storage capacity of 5–10 W h kg−1, which limits their potential applicability in electric vehicles and other high power and high energy density based electronic systems. Considering the current technology, the market needs a device with high energy and high power density.
PCs, on the other hand, include transition metal oxides/hydroxides and conducting polymers, where the charge is stored with redox reactions (i.e., a faradaic process), which increases the capacitance and ultimately the energy density of SCs. There is no phase change of the pseudocapacitive material during the charging/discharging of SCs.18 More specifically, various metal-based materials, such as metal oxides,19–21 metal nitrides,22 metal sulfates,23 and metal carbides, have been investigated in depth for SCs.24
Nickel-based materials have been extensively researched and evaluated as potential pseudocapacitive electrodes. Recently, nickel-based electrodes, such as oxides/hydroxides (NiO,25 Ni(OH)226) bimetallic materials (NiCo2O4,27 NiFe2O4,28 NiMoO429), metal–organic frameworks (MOF),30 sulfide-based materials,31 phosphides,32–37 phosphates,38,39 and pyrophosphates,40,41 have been utilized as an active electrode for catalysis and energy-storage applications owing to their cost-effectiveness, abundant availability, high theoretical capacitance, ecofriendly nature, and chemical and thermal stability.11
Compared to nickel oxides, nitrides, and sulfides, the electrochemical performance of nickel phosphides (NPs) is excellent due to the contribution from the metal ions, various morphologies, and abundant pathways for faster metal-ion transfer.42 Also, NPs have an appropriate pore network43–45 with low internal resistance. The specific surface area (SSA) and porosity also play essential roles in boosting the electrochemical properties. In the last two decades, many efforts have been made to synthesize desirable NP electrodes via simple chemical routes. In addition to their high electrochemical performance, NPs are known for their nontoxicity and biocompatibility.46–48 The exciting features and multiple phases of NPs are illustrated in Fig. 2. Also, various structures of NPs are presented in Fig. 3.

NPs generally have a high theoretical specific capacitance, good thermal and chemical stability in numerous electrolytes, simple fabrication protocols, low cost, and good environmental friendliness. NPs have recently been considered as promising electrode materials in HSCs due to their pure battery characteristics, which store charges through faradaic processes, and their high capacity and long cycle life. Fig. 4 presents the increasing trend in reports on NP-based electrodes in recent years. However, although NPs have been widely investigated in SCs, few comprehensive review articles are available.33,49

Initially, a brief description of the structural features is provided herein. The subsequent section outlines the recent innovations in the synthesis strategies used to prepare NPs with various shapes, sizes, and morphologies. The following section provides an overview of the recent utilization trends of NPs as a positive electrode in combination with a suitable capacitive electrode to boost the high energy density of HSCs. Several innovative approaches are summarized to understand the state-of-the-art progress. Finally, to guide future research, the constraints and opportunities for the advancement of NPs for upcoming energy-storage applications are outlined.
The following is a summary of the main viewpoints covered and the implications of this review for the wider scientific community:

2. Structural studies
Metal phosphides were discovered in the 18th century.32,50 They have better chemical characteristics due to the existence of multi-electron orbitals. They have been investigated for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution,51 as a catalyst in hydrodenitrogenation,52 in the oxygen evolution reaction,53 electrocatalysis,54 and batteries,33,55,56etc. Metal phosphides are frequently utilized in SCs due to their metalloid features and excellent specific capacitances.57–59
Metal phosphides are excellent electrical and thermal conductors, physically robust and durable, and have exceptional chemical durability.49 The degree of delocalization may quickly reduce the ionic character as the P content rises, and as a result, metal-rich phosphides, such as M3P, M2P, and MP, have more free electrons, facilitating electrical conduction.
The architecture of metal phosphides is highly ductile with numerous crystal phases. Metal phosphides have nearly similar properties to metal carbides and nitrides, but they differ in terms of their crystal structure.52,60 Phosphorus has a greater atomic radius (1.09 Å) than carbon (0.71 Å) and nitrogen (0.65 Å); hence, it does not fit into the usual octahedral holes produced by close-packed metal atoms. The 9-fold tetrakaidecahedral52 coordination formation occurs in metal-rich phosphides when the number of nearest neighbours grows, with more metal atoms located towards the centre of the prism's vertical faces. The crystal structures of nickel phosphide are shown in Fig. 3, and the lattice parameters, space group, and unit cell volumes are summarized in Table 1.

NPs have drawn interest because of their remarkable properties, potential applications and various phases. Because of their high theoretical capacitance, ecofriendly nature, superior electrical conductivity, and abundant nature, metal phosphides are recognized as a potential candidate for replacing traditional electrodes in SCs. NiP, NiP2, NiP3, Ni2P, Ni3P, Ni5P2, Ni5P4, and Ni12P5 are thermodynamically steady crystal structures and stoichiometric phases of NPs. Nickel phosphide is a unique highly electrically conductive electrode material that is highly suitable for SCs, has metalloid properties, and outstanding electrical conductivity. Because phosphorous atoms have a lower electronegativity than oxygen atoms, nickel phosphides have metal bonds and covalent bonds, while NiO only possesses covalent bonds.61
3. Electrochemical studies
The synthesis of NPs can be carried out by various strategies, such as hydrothermal,43,62–72 solvothermal,73–83 electrodeposition,58,84–86 ball milling,87 phosphorization,88–93 colloidal synthesis,94 chemical vapour deposition.95 Various interesting morphologies of NPs have been reported, including nanoparticles,68,71,73,75–77,81,83,91,92 nanospheres,66,85 nanoflakes,80,86 nanofibres,82 nanorods,88 nanosheets,43,62–64,89 nanotubes,65 nanocapsules,72 nanoplates,59,94 nanowires,96 microspheres,70,74,78,90 and microstructures.87,93 The different nano/microstructures and morphologies of NPs exhibit diverse electrochemical activities (Table 2).

In the case of nickel phosphide, the typical charge-storage mechanism reaction is as follows, NixPy + 2OH− ↔ NixPy(OH)2 + 2e−(1)
The specific capacity and energy efficiency are given instead of the specific capacitance for battery electrodes, such as NPs. All the required expressions for the analysis of electrochemical data are given below, (2) (3)where i (V) is the current over the voltage window (from cyclic voltammetry, CV), i (A) is the applied current (from galvanostatic charge–discharge, GCD), ν is the scan rate (V s−1), m is the loaded mass of active material, and t is the discharge time (s).
3.1 Electrodes

3.1.1 NiP-based electrodes. 
Among all the nickel phosphides, nickel phosphide (NiP) is a good choice because of its high theoretical specific capacity, high corrosion resistance, and superior chemical and thermal stability. Generally, 3-mercaptopropionic acid is used to enhance the conductivity and rate capability of electrodes. Therefore, Chebrolu et al.58 synthesized NiP using 3-mercaptopropionic acid by an electrodeposition method. Fig. 5(a) presents the GCD and EIS Nyquist plots for NiCo2O4, CoP, and NiP. The specific capacity of the electrode was found to be 136.22 mA h g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 with 81% of the initial capacity retained after 3000 cycles. Similar studies were carried out to study bare nickel phosphide electrodes.73,83 Furthermore, to enhance the electrochemical performance, various strategies have been reported, including studying the synergy with layered double hydroxides (LDHs),62,88 metal-ion doping,64 and polymer composition.97 Transition metal LDH metal phosphides are preferred due to their fast anion exchange and intercalation capability.98 Xing et al.88 synthesized core–shell nanorods of NiP@NiCo-LDH on nickel foam (NF) using phosphorization and a subsequent electrodeposition method. The NiP@NiCo-LDH electrode displayed a specific capacitance of 12.9 F cm−2 at 5 mA cm−2 with a cyclic stability of up to 10000 cycles (only 4% loss in initial capacitance).

Another approach used to overcome the poor rate capability and cycling stability of NiP is by metal-ion (Co,99 Zn,63 and Mo100) doping. Hence, Lei et al.64 introduced Zn cations and S anions into NiP. The ZnNiPS (ZNPS) electrode showed good cyclic stability of 15000 cycles with no retention in capacitance. However, very few studies are available on bimetallic phosphosulfides in supercapacitor applications. Because of its unique chemistry and architecture, bimetallic phosphosulfide ZNPS is an innovative electrode material that can substantially increase the cycling stability of NiP-based electrodes. As bare NiP exhibits poor redox performance, advanced multi-redox materials are needed to boost the capabilities of the bare NiP electrode.


3.1.2 Ni2P-based electrodes. 
Among the investigated transition metal phosphides (TMPs), Ni2P has the highest electrical conductivity (1.2 × 10−3 S cm−1) and a high theoretical capacity (1951.2 C g−1),73,90 making it one of the most promising electrode materials for energy storage. Du et al.77 designed a simple one-pot solvothermal route to synthesize nickel phosphide. The electrochemical performance of the Ni2P electrode was studied in 3 M KOH, and showed a specific capacitance of 668.7 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1. Liu et al.78 synthesized MOF-derived hollow nickel phosphide based on the Kirkendall effect. The Ni2P/C electrode showed a specific capacity of 670.4 C g−1 at 1 A g−1 with 92% decay after 5000 cycles. Binder-free strategies for electrode fabrication are always in demand for energy-storage devices. So, Zhao et al.94 demonstrated the binder-free synthesis of nickel phosphide on nickel foam (NF) using a colloidal synthesis method. Fig. 6(c) shows a SEM image of the Ni2P/NF. The Ni2P/NF electrode displayed a specific capacity of 1032 C g−1 at 1 A g−1 with a cyclic stability of 85.7% after 10000 cycles, as presented in Fig. 6(c). Similar studies were carried out to study Ni2P as a supercapacitive electrode.61,75,77,87,89 To boost the performance of the Ni2P electrode, numerous studies have reported the compositing of Ni2P with carbon-based materials (graphene,76,101 carbon78,102), with polymers66etc.

In the charge–discharge process, the transition metal-ion valence state changes from Ni2+ to Ni3+ on the surface of the electrode. Ni2P + 2OH− ↔ Ni2P(OH)2 + 2e−(4)
However, the extreme volume variation and agglomeration during the charging/discharging hamper nickel phosphide from commercial applications. This problem was solved by Zhang et al.68 by loading Ni2P nanoparticles on acid-treated carbon nanotubes (CNTs) via a hydrothermal route, as presented in Fig. 7(a). Also, a SEM image of the Ni2P@acid-treated CNT (ACNT)(CTAB) is shown in Fig. 7(a). The SSA of the electrode was found to be 465.1 m2 g−1. Electrochemical studies of the electrode were carried out in a 0 to 0.7 V potential window in 3 M KOH electrolyte. The GCD curves for Ni2P, Ni2P@CNT, Ni2P@ACNT, and Ni2P@ACNT(CTAB) are shown in Fig. 7(a). The electrode demonstrated a specific capacitance of 328 F g−1 at 1 A g−1. The electrode was stable for up to 10000 cycles with 83% stability. Whereas, Surendran et al.103 developed a one-pot method for the synthesis of Ni2P electrodes on flexible carbon cloth. At 5 mA cm−2, the Ni2P displayed a maximum specific capacity of 206 mA h g−1.

Another approach for developing high-performance SCs is by synthesizing a hollow or extremely mesoporous architecture capable of providing multiple active sites for ion accommodation. The open frameworks have low density, a high surface-to-volume ratio, and adequate contact among the functional materials and electrolytes.80,90 The synergistic effect between Ni2P and Ni12P5 was studied by Xie et al.104 using a solid-state reaction route. A Ni2P/Ni12P5 composite exhibited a specific capacity of 147.3 mA h g−1 at 1 A g−1 with an outstanding stability of 81% after 20000 cycles. Similar studies are available in the literature.105 Shih et al.84 developed a low-temperature process to synthesize a Ni2P/reduced graphene oxide(rGO)/nickel oxide composite using a two-step electrodeposition. The electrode showed a specific capacity of 742 C g−1 at a 7 mA cm−2 current density. Despite cycling 10000 times, the Ni2P/rGO electrode retained 75% of its initial capacity (Table 3).

3.1.3 Ni3P-based electrodes. 
However, apart from the composition, the active material, nanoarchitecture design, and fabrication significantly affect their applications. For achieving faster surface-controlled, faradaic kinetics, 3D nanostructures are a good choice.106 Accordingly, Ding et al.81 fabricated yolk shell-like Ni3P nanoparticles using a solvothermal method followed by selective etching. The electrode possessed abundant mesopores with an average size of 4.05 nm. Also, it had an SSA of 62.1 m2 g−1. The electrode showed a high specific capacity (749.7 C g−1 at 1 A g−1) due to its unique microstructure and highly intrinsic electrochemical behaviour.


3.1.4 Ni12P5-based electrodes. 
To avoid waste liquid produced from a gas–solid and oil bath method Gan et al.96 synthesized Ni12P5 nanowires using a facile hydrothermal route, which was more convenient and safer. The Ni12P5 nanowires showed a specific capacity of 707.2 C g−1 at 1 A g−1 with a cyclic stability of 68% after 1000 cycles.
The GCD plot from Wan et al.72 for Ni12P5 nanocapsules is shown in Fig. 8(a). The Ni12P5 electrode showed a specific capacitance of 949 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 with 81% initial capacitance retention after 2000 cycles. Whereas, Xu et al.95 studied the binder-free synthesis of Ni12P5/Ni/TiC, as shown in Fig. 8(d). The SEM image of Ni12P5/Ni/TiC is presented in Fig. 8(d). The specific capacitance of the electrode was found to be 160 mF cm−2 at 10 mA cm−2 in 1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte, which was stable for up to 10000 cycles with 82.1% retention of the initial specific capacitance. Fig. 8(d) shows the Ni12P5/Ni/TiC nanocomposite could make an LED glow, revealing the electrode's potential.

3.1.5 NixPx-based electrodes. 
Binder-free synthesis, a 3D structure, and excellent electronic conductivity are always recommended for supercapacitor electrodes.107 Cao et al.85 reported the synthesis of NixP nanospheres using an electrodeposition method. The electrochemical activity of the electrode was recorded in 6 M KOH. The electrode showed a specific capacitance of 382.7 F g−1 at 0.45 A g−1 with the best cyclic stability. Additionally, Zhang et al.86 synthesized carbon fibre-based nickel phosphide using electrodeposition followed by phosphorization. Due to synergy effects, 3D porous structures were formed with enhanced conductivity and rich valencies, as shown in Fig. 9(a). The electrode displayed a specific volumetric capacitance of 817 F cm−3 at a 2 mA cm−2 current density in 1 M KOH.

To improve the electrode's electrochemical performance, active species are typically immobilized into nanostructured carbonaceous materials, such as activated carbon (AC),108 CNT,109 graphene,110,111 and carbon nanofibres (CNFs).108 For improving the performance of the electrode, Wang et al.92 developed a core–shell Ni-NixPy@C nanocomposite at a higher phosphorization temperature. The obtained Ni-NixPy@C/P-HPC demonstrated an ultrahigh specific capacity of 1275 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 due to the synergistic effect of the core–shell Ni-NixPy@C structure and 3D interconnected porous carbon. Furthermore, the robust core–shell structure of the electrode revealed a 92.5% cyclic stability after 5000 cycles.
To improve the pseudocapacitive behaviour along with the redox sites, a bimetallic composition is preferred. So, Zhang et al.93 synthesized bimetallic phosphide on CNFs. The synthesis route and TEM images of Co0.1Ni0.9P/CNF are shown in Fig. 9(b). The SSA of the Co0.1Ni0.9P/CNF electrode was found to be 73.5 m2 g−1. The Co0.1Ni0.9P/CNF electrode showed a superior specific capacity of 1405.6 C g−1 at a current density of 5 A g−1. The electrode displayed an outstanding coulombic efficiency of 96% with a cyclic stability of 80% after 10000 successive charge–discharge cycles.

3.2 Devices
In this section, we discussed nickel phosphide electrodes used effectively in hybrid configurations. Generally, nickel phosphide is used as the positive electrode, whereas negative electrodes tend to be mostly carbon based (AC,112 CQDs,113 CNT114), biomass-derived carbon,115 or graphene based (graphene oxide116 and rGO117) and are used for widening the potential window and achieving excellent performance.

3.2.1 Aqueous electrolytes-based SCs. 
Aqueous electrolytes are generally used for electrochemical studies because of their low internal resistance and strong ionic conductivity. Aqueous electrolytes are generally preferred due to their cost effectiveness and simple preparation method compared to organic electrolytes. The electrolyte selection is based on the mobility of the ions, and size of the bare and hydrated ions.16 In NP-based SCs, only basic and neutral electrolytes are used.
Wang et al.73 fabricated an HSC with the configuration of AC//nickel phosphide in 2 M KOH. The specific capacitance of the device was found to be 105 F g−1 at 5 mV s−1. The HSC displayed a 29.2 W h kg−1 and 8000 W kg−1 maximum energy and power density, respectively. The large specific capacitance and the high working potential window in the aqueous electrolyte contributed to the HSC's high energy density. It also showed excellent cycling behaviour, whereby after 1000 cycles, 84.5% of the initial specific capacitance remained.
However, Ding et al.81 developed an HSC with yolk–shell Ni3P as a cathode and AC as an anode. The device was analyzed with a potential window of 1.2 V in 6 M KOH. The device showed a specific capacitance of 170.8 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 current density. It had a high energy density of 34.2 W h kg−1 at a power density of 299.9 W kg−1, but it also had exceptional cycling stability, with 95.6% capacitance preservation even after 3500 cycles. Two HSCs were connected in a series combination and could reliably power a tiny LED screen or remote control of an automobile. It was demonstrated that Ni3P nanospheres with yolk shells could be used in a wide range of applications and accelerate the advancement of phosphide-based electrodes for HSCs. Whereas Du et al.77 studied both symmetric and hybrid devices based on NPs. Based on the findings, the HSC based on Ni2P nanoparticles and AC showed outstanding electrochemical characteristics, such as a steady electrochemical window of 0–1.5 V, an elevated energy density of 64.6 W h kg−1 at a power density of 1029 W kg−1, and outstanding cycling stability. However, the symmetric SC with Ni2P nanoparticles as the electrode had a relatively shallow voltage window, a smaller specific capacitance, and a lower energy density, limiting their real-world applications. In addition, two HSCs were connected in series and could be charged and then discharged to power a revolving motor and light a red LED. All of these findings showed that HSCs made of Ni2P nanoparticles and AC have a bright future in the field of high-performance energy storage.
HSCs made with an innovative synthesis strategy, and with a long cyclic life and high energy density are in demand. Therefore, Liu et al.61 developed an HSC with nickel phosphide (Ni2P) as a positive electrode and AC as a negative electrode. The device displayed a specific capacity of 239.5 C g−1 at a 0.5 A g−1 current density. The device also delivered a maximum energy density of 53.2 W h kg−1. The outstanding electrochemical performance of these NiP alloys was due to their novel particle structure (large SSA and numerous active sites) and good inherent electrical conductivity. Additionally, Zhao et al.94 developed Ni2P/NF//hierarchical porous activated carbon (HPAC)-based HSC devices that exhibited outstanding cyclic stability, with 85.7% capacitance decay after 10000 consecutive cycles, as shown in Fig. 6(c). The device displayed a maximum energy density of 42.2 W h kg−1 at a power density of 741.1 W kg−1. These intriguing findings show that impactful HSCs with superior supercapacitive performance and cycle stability can be conveniently fabricated. The remarkable electrochemical results of the Ni2P/NF//HPAC device may be due to the above-mentioned factors: (1) the high capacitance of the Ni2P/NF working electrode, (2) the nanostructures of Ni2P and porous carbon, which provide rapid charge transportation pathways during redox reactions; (3) the binder-free synthesis of Ni2P, which had a minimum resistance.
Electrode materials with a high specific capacity, novel nanostructures, and outstanding rate capability are preferred for HSCs. Ni12P5 has excellent electrical conductivity due to its zero band gap, which shows metallic properties and indicates it can be used as a high-performance electrode in SCs. Keeping this in mind, Gan et al.96 fabricated an HSC device as Ni12P5//AC, which showed a specific capacity of 243.4 C g−1 at a current density of 0.56 A g−1. The device revealed a maximum energy density of 108.2 W h kg−1 and an 8.96 kW kg−1 power density. Also, the device could successfully light LEDs illuminating the word “HUBU”, which indicated the device's high performance. As a result of their excellent properties, Ni12P5 nanowires produced in a single step have enormous potential for energy and power systems.
However, Li et al.65 reported an affordable, simple hydrothermal approach to create NiP nanowires (NWs) with a 3D porous network. The NiP NWs were used as a precursor and calcinated in an argon (Ar) environment to synthesize NiP@Ni nanotubes (NTs) with a 3D porous network. They also fabricated a device with NiP@Ni NTs as the positive electrode and AC as the negative electrode for HSCs. The electrochemical performance of the device was investigated in 2 M KOH electrolyte. The device revealed a maximum energy and power density of 58.7 W h kg−1 and 14356.8 W kg−1, respectively. The device showed a cyclic stability of 91.2% capacity retention after 6000 cycles.
Xing et al.88 simply integrated NPs with NiCo-LDH by a simple phosphorization of NF and followed by electrodeposition to generate core–shell nanorod arrays on the NF. The NiP@NiCo-LDH was then employed as a direct pseudocapacitive electrode. The hybrid electrode showed considerably improved electrochemical performances due to the excellent synergistic impact of NiP and NiCo-LDH nanostructures (NSs) and the hierarchical structure of 1D nanorods, 2D NSs, and 3D Ni foam. Additionally, the HSC was built using a positive electrode of NiP@NiCo-LDH and a negative electrode of AC. The developed HSC provided exceptional energy and power density, in addition to strong cycling performance. Its future application in SCs was demonstrated by illuminating LEDs in sequence by two NiP@NiCo-LDH//AC HSCs.
Due to rapid phosphorus oxidation, a lack of porosity, and an irreversible Faraday reaction, NiP-based SCs often have a poor rate capability and cycle stability. Metal (Zn, Co, and Mo)-ion doping to produce multicomponent metal phosphides is a feasible solution to these problems. Due to its vigorous chemical activity, Zn doping may enable rapid redox reaction kinetics; Zn doping may alter the bandgap, resulting in increased electron mobility and electrical conductivity. Due to the complex compositions of multi-metal materials and their distinct valence states, the overall electrochemical performance was boosted.
Lei et al.64 created bimetallic phosphosulfide ZNPS 2D NSs by introducing Zn cations and S anions into NiP, and they demonstrated a faster rate capability and cyclic stability in an aqueous HSC. Bimetallic phosphosulfide ZNPS NSs were produced directly on Ni foam using a straightforward two-step approach that included hydrothermal, phosphorization, and sulfurization procedures. The developed ZNPS//AC aqueous HSC exhibited a maximum energy and power density of 29.01 W h kg−1 and 1012.36 W kg−1 within a working potential window of 1.6 V. The cyclic stability of the HSC device was excellent, with no decay in capacitance even after 15000 consecutive charge–discharge cycles, as presented in Fig. 5(d). The HSC also exhibited a superior rate capability.
Li et al.74 reported the fabrication of mesoporous NiP@NiCo2O4 composite materials using a simple technique that included the solvothermal synthesis of NiP followed by the chemical deposition of NiCo2O4. Furthermore, an HSC was developed with NiP@NiCo2O4 as the positive electrode and AC as the negative electrode. The device displayed a specific capacitance of 71 F g−1 at 10 mV s−1 in a 1.4 V working potential window. The HSC also exhibited an energy density of 13.3 W h kg−1 with 78.3% initial capacitance retention after 10000 cycles.
Hou et al.90 reported that the concurrent carbonization and phosphorization of Ni-based MOFs resulted in the production of carbon-incorporated Janus-type Ni2P/Ni hollow spheres (Ni2P/Ni/C) (Ni-MOFs). One of its distinguishing structural features was the incorporated carbon content and Janus-type Ni2P/Ni nanocrystals with a high-porosity hollow shape, giving the spheres a large SSA, strong electrical conductivity, and low density. With Ni2P/Ni/C as the anode and AC as the cathode, the authors developed an HSC device. The CV curves of the Ni2P/Ni/C and AC electrodes at a scan rate of 20 mV s−1 in 2 M KOH electrolyte are shown in Fig. 6(d). The HSC device displayed excellent cycling with a maximum energy and power density of 32.02 W h kg−1 and 7000 W kg−1, respectively. After 5000 consecutive cycles, the device retained about 99% of its capacity.
Binder-free Ni2P/NF NSs were effectively produced using a simple hydrothermal process followed by phosphorization, as reported by M.S.P. et al.43 Carbon NPs were incorporated using dielectric barrier discharge jet plasma; the resultant Ni2P/NF electrode had an enhanced capacity while the porous AC was made utilizing hydrothermal and carbonization waste from peanut shells. As-fabricated Ni2P-C/NF/PNS//AC HSCs showed excellent electrochemical performances in terms of an areal capacity of 318.8 A h cm−2. Also, the maximum energy and power density of the HSC were 108.1 W h kg−1 and 14370.4 W kg−1, respectively, with a cyclic stability of 90.1% retention of the initial capacity after 5000 cycles at a current density of 7 A g−1. The extraordinary performance was due to the synergistic impact of the carbon NPs in the linked spaces of the self-assembled Ni2P/NF electrode, resulting in a rapid ion transit for the faradaic reaction. Also, the synthesis of rGO/Ni2P composites was carried out by Lv et al.79via an in situ phosphorization technique with GO/Ni-MOF as precursors. Compared to pure Ni2P, the rGO/Ni2P composites showed a boosted electrochemical performance. The rGO/Ni2P electrode showed the highest specific capacitance of the composites obtained: 890 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 with an energy density and power density of 35.9 W h kg−1 and 752 W kg−1, respectively.
The well-defined oxide/phosphorus core–shell material can be considered a potential electrode material for high-performance SCs. A new porous core–shell nanocomposite based on rhombic niobium pentoxide (T-Nb2O5) nanowires and metal phosphorus nanofibres to achieve a simple, cost-effective energy-storage system at a realistic level was reported by Wang and co-workers.80 The working electrode was reasonably designed and developed by an effective solvothermal and phosphoryzation approach. The T-Nb2O5 nanowires played a structural orientation role in the directional growth of hierarchical ultrafine porous nickel (Ni2P) nanocottons, which offered high conductivity, a significant SSA, and sufficient sites where redox activity could take place. The core–shell structure with Nb2O5@Ni2P in its unique nanostructure resulted in a dramatic improvement in the electrochemical properties. In addition, an HSC was built based on T-Nb2O5@Ni2P//AC and demonstrated a high energy density of 30.2 W h kg−1 with a power density of 453 W kg−1 and impressive cycle stability (90%) for 5000 cycles.
The solvothermal conversion of MOF precursors to form Ni2P/C hollow microspheres can be used to prepare additional carbon-based electrode materials for energy-storage and -conversion technologies. A simple two-step solvothermal approach was used to successfully produce Ni2P/C hollow microspheres with a pure Ni2P phase by Liu et al.78 Its many electrochemically active sites and high SSA reduced the ion-diffusion length in the electrolyte and improved its electrochemical characteristics. The energy density of the Ni2P/C//AC HSC was 42.74 W h kg−1 with a 1.4 V working potential window. Also, the cyclic stability of the HSC showed a 95% initial capacitance retention after 5000 cycles.
N-doped-carbon (NC) sheets were created and put into a conducting graphene sheet by Zhang et al.,67 resulting in a Ni2P-Ni@NC@G complex. Combining graphene sheets, the NC coating and Ni NPs provided uninterrupted electron-transport routes, leading to accelerated electrode reaction kinetics and a better rate performance. Additionally, the graphene sheets and decorated Ni particles could handle stress, enhance the electrochemical activity, and maintain an integrated electrode structure. The composite also displayed an enhanced capacitive performance due to various beneficial properties. HSCs with an incredible energy and power density of 53.13 W h kg−1 and 3750 W kg−1, respectively, were also developed in 3 M KOH electrolyte.
NiSe, Ni3S2, and NiSe/Ni3S2 heterostructures with different Se/S ratios were formed on NF by Tao et al.82 using a one-step solvothermal route, and their morphologies and electrochemical behaviours were investigated. Ni12P5 NPs were grown on the surface of NiSe/Ni3S2 nanofibres by a phosphorization treatment. The as-fabricated NiSe/Ni3S2/Ni12P5/NF//AC HSC device displayed an areal capacity of 2.04 mA h cm−2 at 10 mA cm−2 (272 mA h g−1 at 1 A g−1) with excellent cycling stability. After 5000 cycles at 140 mA cm−2, the HSC had a capacity of 86%.
A high-temperature phosphorization technique was designed to synthesize a core–shell Ni-NixPy@C nanocomposite immobilized sponge-like P-doped porous carbon (Ni-NixPy@C/PHPC) by Wang et al.,92 which could effectively improve the overall electrochemical efficiency of SCs. A cross-linking process and subsequent high-temperature calcination were used to synthesize the Ni-NixPy@C/PHPC electrode successfully. The findings showed that the synthesized material had the benefits of an interconnected P-doped structure, which facilitated rapid ion transport, while nickel and nickel phosphide endowed the material with a high specific capacitance, and the graphene-like shell structure enhanced the electrical conductivity and acted as an adequate guard for the active sites. The HSC fabricated using Ni-NixPy@C/PHPC and AC as the anode and cathode material, respectively, exhibited a high energy density of 49.4 W h kg−1. Liu and co-worker69 presented an excellent structural design of 3D honeycomb-like self-supported biphasic NixPy NSs knitted by multiple interweaved NPs by a hydrothermal method to obtain a supercapacitor electrode. The biphasic Ni5P4-Ni2P NSs were interlaced with a significant number of NPs. The developed NixPy//AC HSC device had a maximum energy density of 67.2 W h kg−1 and a maximum power density of 15000 W kg−1.
Wang et al.87 fabricated an Fe2O3//Ni2P supercapacitor device, which displayed an energy density of 35.5 W h kg−1 at a power density of 400 W kg−1. The device retained 96% of its initial specific capacity after 1000 cycles. At the same time, an energy density of 29.8 W h kg−1 was achieved by the as-fabricated Fe2O3//Ni5P4 supercapacitor device. Also, the device sustained a specific capacitance of 86% after 1000 consecutive cycles. Furthermore, Kim et al.75 developed an Fe3O4//Ni2P supercapacitor with a device voltage of 1.6 V. The specific capacity of the device was found to be 70 C g−1 at a current rate of 1 A g−1. According to the EIS spectrum, the device had Rs and Rct values of 2.34 and 3.8 Ω, respectively. Finally, a foldable HSC with a relatively high cyclic stability was developed (20000 cycles) with an enhanced energy density (31 W h kg−1) and power density (6400 W kg−1).
High-performance SCs benefit from the logical design and manufacture of flexible pseudocapacitive materials with high energy density and exceptional cycle stability.118 A hybrid FeNiP@CoNi-LDH was formed by vertically growing an FeNiP NS and CoNi-LDH NS on carbon fabric by Wan et al.62 using a consecutive hydrothermal, phosphorization treatment and electrodeposition method. The as-prepared FeNiP@CoNi-LDH had a high SSA, a 3D linked NS pore architecture, with multiple active sites, which facilitated rapid electron- and mass-transfer pathways. An aqueous as-fabricated HSC device based on FeNiP@CoNi-LDH and porous carbon displayed a maximum energy and power density of 87.3 W h kg−1 and 408.8 W kg−1, respectively. Also, the device displayed an outstanding cycling stability of 73.9% after 20000 cycles.
Nickel phosphide nanoparticle self-inlaid carbon NS frameworks (Ni2P-CNFWs) were created by pyrolyzing gelatin with nickel nitrate and then phosphorizing them at low temperature.91 The presence of CNFWs in the Ni2P-CNFWs structure provided fast electrically conductive channels and prevented aggregation while maximizing the utilization of the reactive sites in the Ni2P NPs due to the unique interconnected CNFWs with highly interconnected porous structures. A Ni2P-CNFs//CNFWs HSC was assembled, which delivered an energy and power density of 42 W h kg−1 and 413 W kg−1, respectively, with an 88% capacity retention after 6000 cycles.
To create porous carbon strutted NP nanoparticles, in situ ‘gel-blowing’ pyrolysis followed by a low-temperature phosphorylation approach was utilized by the same research group.71 To emphasize, a novel aqueous HSC based on porous carbon strutted nickel phosphide NPs and activated honeycomb-like porous carbon electrodes was assembled, and achieved a wide working potential window of 1.7 V and an energy and power density of 32 W h kg−1 and 907 W kg−1, respectively. Furthermore, its cycle stability was outstanding, with 98% capacity preservation after 8000 cycles.


3.2.2 Solid/quasi solid-state electrolyte-based SCs. 
As the demand for portable and wearable devices increases day-by-day, solid-state electrolyte-based SCs are a good choice. Aqueous systems suffer from volatility and a narrow potential window, which restricts the electrode's capability. Non-aqueous systems have many advantages over aqueous systems, such as higher safety, high conductivity, easy fabrication and packing process, and no leakage issues.119 Another advantage of the solid-state electrolytes is that, along with the ionic conducting media, they also serve as a separator in the device. With the help of solid-state electrolytes, the fabrication of flexible and bendable devices was possible. Generally for the development of NP-based solid-state hybrid devices, gel polymer-based electrolytes are preferred as they allow fabricating devices with desired shapes.
Zhou et al.89 fabricated an HSC device based on Ni2P and AC. The device revealed a specific capacitance of 96 F g−1 at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1 with a 1.4 V working potential window. Also, the device showed a maximum energy density of 26 W h kg−1. However, Shih et al.84 studied the capability of the Ni2P/rGO/NiO/NF electrode in a real-world application. An HSC device was developed using NP/rGO/NiO/NF and AC electrodes. The device was tested in a 1.2 V potential window in PVA/KOH gel electrolyte. After 10000 consecutive cycles, approximately 70% of the initial capacitance remained. Also, the device could light up LEDs in a test, which showed the potential of the fabricated device.
Meanwhile, Zhang et al.86 developed a solid-state HSC device with CF@NiPx and CF@Ni@rGO as the cathode and the anode, respectively. The fibre-based flexible device showed a volumetric energy density of 8.97 mW h cm−3, remarkable cyclic stability, and outstanding flexibility, as presented in Fig. 9(a). Different composition strategies were investigated to improve the electrochemical performance of nickel phosphide; whereas, for material composition, low-cost and straightforward synthesis methods are always preferred. Zhang et al.93 also developed a flexible solid-state HSC using CoNiP/CNF and AC as the positive and negative electrode materials, respectively. The CV curves of the fabricated device at various scan rates are presented in Fig. 9(b). The device delivered an energy density of 32.2 W h kg−1 at 3500 W kg−1 power density with satisfactory cyclic stability of up to 10000 cycles, as shown in Fig. 9(b).
Generally, 3D hierarchical nanostructures are desired to achieve a high performance of the SC electrode as it provides porous networks for better ion transport. So, Nguyen et al.63 synthesized a ZnNiP NS//Fe2O3@nitrogen-doped graphene (NG) all-solid-state HSC, which revealed an ultrahigh volumetric capacity (1.99 mA h cm−3), outstanding energy density (90.12 W h kg−1), and 6.95% decay in initial capacity after 20000 consecutive cycles at a high current density of 15 mA cm−2. The HSC device could successfully light an LED, which glowed red LED. These enticing characteristics pave the way for the development of high-energy HSCs. Meanwhile, Chen et al.120 developed a coin-type HSC with the configuration of Ni2P-PNGTMSs//PNGTMSs. The device was tested in a 1.8 V potential window in PVA/KOH gel electrolyte. The as-fabricated HSC device delivered an energy and power density of 39.8 W h kg−1 and 450.6 W kg−1, respectively. Also, the two HSC devices were used to get 18 red LEDs to glow. The device showed ∼97% cyclic stability after 5000 consecutive charge–discharge cycles.

4. Concluding remarks and future perspectives
The application of NPs in SCs is an emerging field that is opening new pathways for high-performance device fabrication. The authors have faith that NPs are promising and competent electrode materials for SCs. Many recent research studies have been based on NPs, revealing exciting results. As summarized above, the SSA, charge transport rate, electrical conductivity, cyclic stability, and specific capacity play crucial roles in NP SCs. This review discussed efforts towards tuning the structure and morphology with the help of various synthesis routes, which can enhance the electrochemical performance of devices. Precisely, this review summarises the developments in NPs as electrode materials in the field of SCs. NP-based devices are well elaborated in the literature with encouraging advancements, but still ground-breaking efforts are necessary to boost the electrochemical performances of SCs based on NPs. Here, we have outlined some of the current issues and future perspectives of NP SCs.
• Various methods have been summarised in this review, and many are highly creative and give decent performances, and it is clear that sophisticated routes should be considered to achieve the desired architecture of high-performance SC devices. Strategies with an ecofriendly nature and low-cost approaches are preferred. Therefore, optimizing the synthesis routes, reaction temperature, nature of the precursor solution (acidic/basic/neutral), concentration of the precursors, etc. should be considered.
• High-performance NP electrodes having multidimensional micro/macrostructures can be synthesized using advanced sophisticated techniques, like 3D printing. These approaches may be integrated with conventional methods, like CVD, electrospinning, electrodeposition, and so on, to create engineered electrodes suitable for SCs.
• The phosphorization approach can improve the supercapacitor performance and is flexible, accessible, and feasible, and it may be applied to various transition metals, such as copper, manganese, zinc, and iron.
• The redox chemistries of several NPs have still not yet been deeply investigated for SC application. However, as most of them are already best-performing battery electrodes, they should indeed act as competent electrodes for SCs.
• Solid-state flexible SC devices have several attractive features over liquid systems, including outstanding flexibility, safety, and lightweight. Nevertheless, very few reports are available on solid-state flexible NP devices. Therefore, researchers should pay attention to hybrid solid-state flexible devices so that they can be commercialized.
• The value of the energy density is directly proportional to the square of the potential window. So, the selection and optimization of electrolytes is an essential factor in SCs. Generally, electrodes and electrolytes decide the potential window. NPs must be studied in organic and ionic electrolytes to widen the potential window to achieve high energy density. Also, studies on high voltage supercapacitors with non-aqueous electrolytes and redox additive electrolyte-based NPs have not been reported yet. Therefore, appropriate electrodes and electrolytes should be considered together to achieve high-performance SCs.
• As discussed above, HSC devices consist of electrodes with different charge-storage mechanisms. At the same time, NPs should be configured based on HSC devices, and NPs combined with any other capacitive electrode (electric double-layer capacitor/pseudocapacitor). Also, the working potential window and structural chemistry of the electrode materials should be kept in mind to boost device performance.
In summary, the present review outlines the various NP structures together with their mechanism and up-to-date research in the field of NPs. We expect this review to fill the gap between previously taken research efforts and upcoming research ideas. Finally, we conclude that micro/nanostructured NP devices still need to be found that will excell in high-performance, durability, efficiency, and safe energy-storage devices.
