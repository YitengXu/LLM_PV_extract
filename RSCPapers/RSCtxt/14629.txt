    , Accepted 12th May 2020First published on 12th May 2020AbstractA novel visible-light catalytic material, modified g-C3N4 with Fe-doped SnO2 (Fe-SnO2/g-C3N4), was prepared by a chemical precipitation-ball milling-baking method. This photocatalytic material showed sterilization performance for Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus under the irradiation of a daylight lamp, natural sunlight, near ultraviolet light and simulated sunlight, among which the sterilization performance–enhancing effect was the most prominent under daylight lamp irradiation, suggesting practical application prospects. Scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy were used to analyze the structure of Fe-SnO2/g-C3N4. It was found that Fe-SnO2 was uniformly dispersed on g-C3N4, forming a new type of porous layered heterojunction, which increased the surface activity and specific surface area. Fe doping further regulates the energy band structure and promotes the Z-scheme electron conduction capability of the Fe-SnO2/g-C3N4 heterojunction. The main free radicals that perform sterilization are ˙OH and ˙O2. Based on the biochemical structure of bacteria, the charge Z-scheme conduction sterilization mechanism is proposed from the perspectives of free radical generation energy level, biochemical reaction energy and chemical bond energy.
1 Introduction
The photocatalytic sterilization technology has gained interest because of its high efficiency, low toxicity, no drug resistance, long-term effectiveness and good stability.1 The earliest used materials for photocatalytic sterilization are based on TiO2 and its doped and modified composite materials, such as silver-coated TiO2 nanomaterials2 and Ag@TiO2@SiO2 composite materials.3 However, the antibacterial properties of these materials are well exhibited only under ultraviolet light. By doping special metal ions and forming special heterojunction interfaces, the energy band structure of the composite material can be adjusted to improve the visible light response, thus further developing photocatalytic sterilization of novel photocatalysts such as H-Bi2WO6,4 hemin-bismuth tungstate (HBWO) composites,5 Fe-doped TiO2,6 Pt/TiO2,7 N-doped TiO2/C nanocomposites8 and TiO2/CoMoO4/PANI9 under visible light. However, because the light quantum efficiencies of these doping-modified TiO2 materials are still low, they respond only to light near the ultraviolet range (300–400 nm); hence, they are unable to effectively use sunlight as a light source.10 Huang et al.11 for the first time reported the use of g-C3N4 as a photocatalyst to inactivate bacteria under visible light irradiation. However, the materials synthesized based on g-C3N4 have a small surface area, high recombination rate of photo-generated electron–hole pairs and poor photocatalytic activity, which seriously affect the practical applications of g-C3N4.12,13 Yang et al. reported that a photocatalyst with a PTCDI–PANI (doped Fe(III)) heterostructure showed an E. coli inactivation rate of 95.8% upon irradiation under visible light for 24 h.14 In short, the photocatalytic sterilization technology still has two scientific limitations that need to be overcome: (1) the narrow light absorption range of the TiO2 photocatalytic sterilization materials restrains their sunlight utilization rates and (2) the sterilization rates of the newly synthesized g-C3N4 materials are also low because of their small surface area and high recombination rate of photo-generated electron–hole pairs. Therefore, the preparation of new structural materials with high photoelectron conversion efficiency under visible light irradiation is the key technology to improve the photocatalytic sterilization efficiency.
It is known that free radicals including h+, ˙OH, ˙O2− and e− are proposed to be the reactive species for photocatalytic disinfection. Different photocatalytic materials produce different free radicals. In recent years, many studies have explored the sterilization mechanisms of photocatalytic materials to some extent. For example, Zhan et al.15 used AgBr/g-C3N4 hybrid nanocomposites to disinfect Escherichia coli (E. coli) as a model pathogen in water under visible light irradiation. They monitored the morphological changes in bacteria, analyzed the effects of the reactive species, and studied the inactivation mechanism of E. coli in combination with the energy band structure. Fu et al.16 used MoS2/Ag2CO3 as a new heterojunction photocatalyst to explore the mechanisms of the photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants and the inactivation of E. coli. Guo et al.17 reported that an AgI/Bi2Sn2O7 nanocomposite could effectively inactivate bacteria and also explored the disinfection mechanism. The enhancement of the photocatalytic sterilization performance is attributed to the regulation of the energy band structure of the material, which enhances the photocatalytic activity, so that h+, ˙OH, ˙O2− and e− are different and the corresponding concentrations are increased, thereby enhancing the sterilization effect.14,18 Among them, the Z-scheme electron conduction mechanism better explains the remarkable improvement of the photocatalytic activity. Zeng et al.19 reported that a BiVO4/Ag/g-C3N4 composite material can significantly enhance the photocatalytic disinfection activity, which is attributed to the Z-scheme charge transfer mode with Ag, as the electron mediator effectively inhibited the recombination of electron–hole pairs and promoted the generation of effective active radicals. Yong et al.20 reported a new type of visible light–driven Z-scheme AgVO3/AgI graphene microtube (AgVO3/AgI@GM). Due to the unique structure of strong coupling between AgVO3 and AgI, the charge separation rate is improved, the interfacial charge transfer is promoted, and the visible light response range is expanded. Huang et al.21 modified an Ag/AgBr photocatalyst with magnetic CoFe2O4 nanoparticles (NPs) and found that it has a Z-scheme charge transfer mechanism. Nanoparticles can effectively capture photogenerated electrons of AgBr, thus significantly promoting electron–hole separation, which results in good sterilization performance. Guan et al.22 prepared a new AgI/BiVO4 photocatalyst and found that the Z-scheme charge transfer mode generates effective free radicals, thereby inactivating bacteria. In addition, Shi et al.23 reported visible light–driven photocatalytic inactivation of E. coli with an Ag QD-decorated Z-scheme Bi2S3/SnIn4S8 composite. The results of scanning electron microscopy and fluorescence staining, and protein and DNA electrophoresis showed that the membrane of the bacteria treated with the Ag QDs/Bi2S3/SnIn4S8 material was destroyed, and the intracellular biomolecules (including protein and DNA) leaked.23
It is reported that Fe3+ has a special half-filled electronic configuration and Fe3+-doped SnO2 can help the composite to form a new intermediate energy level, thus narrowing the band gap of SnO2 and improving the visible light absorption.24 Zhang et al.25 synthesized Fe-doped SnO2 by a one pot method, and the material's degradation rate for rhodamine B (RhB) was 7 times higher than that for pure SnO2. Walid et al.26 successfully prepared Fe-doped SnO2 by a hydrothermal method, and the degradation rate of Fe-doped SnO2 for RhB was 1.33 times that of pure SnO2. Although the doping of Fe greatly improves the photocatalytic activity of pure SnO2, the defect of high recombination of photogenerated carriers still exists in Fe-doped SnO2.26 Previous studies have suggested that the best way to improve the effective separation of photogenerated electrons and holes is to combine Fe-doped SnO2 with a suitable semiconductor to form a heterojunction.27 g-C3N4, a graphene-like layered photocatalyst, attracts researchers’ attention because of its stability, strong visible-light absorption and easy preparation.28,29 The results indicated that the heterojunction of SnO2 and g-C3N4 can meet the following requirements: large surface area and effective separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs.30 Therefore, it can be inferred that the heterojunction materials formed by the combination of Fe-doped SnO2 and g-C3N4 can solve the defects of Fe-doped SnO2 and improve the photocatalytic bactericidal performance of the composites. Thus far, there is no report on the use of Fe-SnO2/g-C3N4 heterojunction materials for bactericidal inactivation. Therefore, the use of Fe-SnO2/g-C3N4 photocatalytic materials for sterilization is worthy of our study.
In the research of photocatalytic sterilization mechanism, all the studies including those mentioned above only reported that free radicals are generated in the photocatalytic process, and the free radicals damage the bacterial cell (wall) membrane, resulting in bacterial death. However, little has been done on the questions: (1) what the relationship is between the energy transferred by electron excitation and cell wall disintegration during photocatalysis and (2) how free radicals destroy the biomolecular structure of bacterial cell walls. These interesting scientific problems need further study. Therefore, a new heterojunction formed by Fe-doped SnO2 and the porous layered g-C3N4 was explored in this paper. The photocatalytic sterilization performance of Fe-SnO2/g-C3N4 under irradiation using various light sources was evaluated. Combined with the biochemical molecular structure of bacteria, the sterilization mechanism of this material is deeply discussed from the perspectives of energy level, charge transfer mode, chemical bond energy and reaction energy generated by photogenerated electrons.
2 Materials and methods
2.1 Preparation of heterojunction materials
Porous layered g-C3N4 (CN) was prepared by calcining melamine in a muffle furnace at 550 °C for 4 h, followed by ball milling to give a light yellow powder.31,32 Fe-doped SnO2 (Fe-SnO2) was prepared by first dissolving 1.5 g SnCl2·2H2O and an appropriate amount of FeCl3·6H2O with deionized water, adjusting the pH to 8 with ammonia water, washing the solution with deionized water to remove chloride ions before drying in an oven at 80 °C overnight, and finally heating in a muffle furnace at 600 °C for 2 h. A Fe-SnO2/g-C3N4 (Fe-SCN) composite material was obtained by adding 0.1 g Fe-SnO2 composite material and 0.3 g porous CN into a beaker with deionized water and stirring for 2 h. This is followed by ultrasonication for 30 min, oven-drying overnight before roasting in a muffle furnace at 200 °C for 2 h and finally ball milling.
2.2 Photocatalytic sterilization experiments

Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) were chosen as the indicator bacteria. They represent Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria respectively. The prefabricated bacterial suspension was also added into the physiological saline. Under aseptic conditions, sterilized 1 wt% Fe-SCN was mixed evenly in the physiological saline, and then added into the prefabricated bacterial suspension. The concentration of 1 wt% Fe-SCN in the final system is 0.5 mg mL−1, and the bacterial concentration is 1.0 × 105 cfu mL−1. These mixed suspensions were continuously stirred using magnetic stirrers at room temperature under four light sources, respectively. The four light sources adopted were ultraviolet light, simulated sunlight, daylight and natural sunlight. The power of the ultraviolet lamp was 7 W with a wavelength of 365 nm and an average light intensity of 64000 lux. The simulated sunlight was applied using a Xe lamp of 300 W. The power of the daylight lamp was 100 W with an average light intensity of 96500 lux. Natural sunlight irradiation was from 10:00 am to 15:00 pm in sunny days with an average illumination intensity of 67000 lux. At certain time intervals, 1 mL of suspension was taken out and diluted with sterilized physiological saline. Then, an aliquot of the diluted solution was evenly dispersed on the Luria-Bertani (LB) agar medium. After culturing at 37 °C for 24 h, the number of viable bacteria was counted using the plate colony counting method. The whole experimental procedure was conducted under sterile conditions. Besides the experimental group (with 1 wt% Fe-SCN and light), a control group (with light, no 1 wt% Fe-SCN) was carried out with the same procedure. Each group had triplicates, and the average value was taken for statistical analysis. The bacterial mortality rates of the control and experimental groups were compared to determine the sterilization performance of the material. The structural changes of the photocatalytically inactivated bacteria were studied by SEM.
2.3 Material structure and mechanism analysis method
The morphology and microstructure of the samples were characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, ZEISS), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM, JEM2100F) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM2100F). The crystal structure of the samples was investigated by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD, Bruker D8 ADVANCE A25X) with Cu Kα irradiation. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Escalab 250Xi) was performed to analyze the surface chemical composition of the sample. Ultraviolet-visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (Shimadzu, UV-2600) was performed to analyze the light absorption and conversion properties of the sample, and Mott–Schottky experiment (CHI 760E, Shanghai) was performed to measure and calculate the energy band structure of the sample. According to the analyses of the microstructural and electrical properties of the 1 wt% Fe-SCN composite material, the photocatalytic sterilization mechanism of 1 wt% Fe-SCN was revealed based on the energy levels of excitation and the transfer of electrons and free radical generation and combined with the cell biochemical structure and the reaction energy of corresponding chemical bonds.
3 Results and discussion
3.1 Photocatalytic sterilization performance of 1 wt% Fe-SCN
In preliminary experiments, a series of Fe-SCN doped with 0, 1, 2, and 3 wt% Fe were prepared and their photocatalytic performance was evaluated by dye degradation experiments. It was found that 1 wt% Fe-SCN showed the highest degradation rate for MB and RhB. Thus, 1 wt% Fe-SCN was chosen for further studying its photocatalytic sterilization performance in this study.

Fig. 1a shows that the sterilization rates for E. coli and S. aureus reached 80.9% and 59.5% respectively with 1 wt% Fe-SCN, after irradiation under natural sunlight for 1 h. Compared with the control group, the sterilization rates increased by 10.8% and 31.6% respectively. The results indicated that 1 wt% Fe-SCN has good photocatalytic sterilization capability under natural sunlight irradiation.

Fig. 1b shows that the sterilization rate for E. coli with 1 wt% Fe-SCN reached 49.0% after irradiation using a daylight lamp for 1 h, while the sterilization rate of the control group was only 3.0%. In addition, after 3 h of daylight irradiation, the sterilization rate with 1 wt% Fe-SCN reached 100%, which was 88.9% higher than that of the control group. As to S. aureus, the sterilization rate of the experimental group was 52.8% higher than that of the control group after 4 h of daylight irradiation. The results indicated that the mortality rates of E. coli and S. aureus were low in the control group with only daylight lamp irradiation. However, after adding 1 wt% Fe-SCN, the mortality rates of both bacteria significantly increased, which indicated that 1 wt% Fe-SCN has excellent bactericidal performance under daylight lamp irradiation, especially for E. coli. In the research using g-C3N4 as a photocatalytic sterilization material, even CN230 with the best sterilization performance requires 4 h of illumination under visible light to reach a sterilization rate of over 99% for E. coli,11 whereas the 1 wt% Fe-SCN heterojunction material reached the same sterilization rate within 2 h of illumination.
The 1 wt% Fe-SCN heterojunction material showed higher bactericidal activity under UV irradiation than under natural sunlight and simulated sunlight irradiation. Still, the bacterial mortality rates of the experimental groups with 1 wt% Fe-SCN were continuously higher than those of the control groups during the illumination (Fig. 1c). After 90 min, the mortality rates of E. coli and S. aureus with 1 wt% Fe-SCN reached 100% and 99.5%, respectively, which were 6% and 9% higher than the control groups, respectively. The results indicated that 1 wt% Fe-SCN can also increase the ultraviolet sterilization effect.
The simulated solar light source showed the strongest sterilization ability among the four light sources by sterilizing 99% of the two bacteria in 15 min of illumination (Fig. 1d). Even so, using 1 wt% Fe-SCN still improved the sterilization efficiency by reducing the time of illumination for 100% sterilization from 15 min to 5 min, which suggested that 1 wt% Fe-SCN can also improve the sterilization effect under simulated sunlight.

Fig. 2 and 3 show the growth of the two light-inactivated bacteria on the agar plates. It is obvious that the control group without illumination was full of bacteria on the whole plate, while the plates under different light sources had few or even no colonies. This suggests that 1 wt% Fe-SCN has significant photocatalytic sterilization performance on representative Gram-negative bacteria (E. coli) and Gram-positive bacteria (S. aureus), and has certain broad-spectrum antibacterial properties. Through the photocatalytic sterilization experiments, it was found that E. coli was more responsive to the sterilization effect of 1 wt% Fe-SCN than S. aureus under the four light sources, which is because of the different cell wall structures of the two bacteria. S. aureus, like other Gram-positive bacteria, has a thicker cell wall with a peptidoglycan content as high as 90%, and the peptidoglycan reticular molecules interweave to form a multi-layer compact structure on the cell,33 which has a stronger ability to hinder the destruction of active radicals. As to Gram-negative bacteria, such as E. coli, their cell walls are thinner, thus more easily to be damaged by active radicals. Therefore, 1 wt% Fe-SCN showed higher photocatalytic sterilization rate for Gram-negative bacteria (e.g. E. coli) than Gram-positive bacteria (e.g. S. aureus).

3.2 Structural characteristics of Fe-SCN
In order to explore the photocatalytic sterilization mechanism, the composition, bond energy composition, surface morphology, crystal orientation structure, and light response properties of Fe-SCN were analyzed, and the modulation effect of doping elements on the energy band structure was also evaluated.

3.2.1 Material composition analyses (XRD and XPS). 

Fig. 4a shows the XRD patterns of SnO2, CN and 1 wt% Fe-SCN. The peak of CN was mainly located at 27.4°, corresponding to the diffraction plane of (002).34 The diffraction peaks of SnO2 at 26.5°, 33.8°, 38.0° and 51.8° can be indexed as the (110), (101), (200) and (211) diffraction planes of the tetragonal phase SnO2 (JCPDS: No. 41-1445),35 respectively. The diffraction peaks of 1 wt% Fe-SCN were the combination of CN and Fe-SnO2.
 Fig. 4  XRD patterns of SnO2, CN and 1 wt% Fe-SCN (a); XPS survey spectra of SCN and 1 wt% Fe-SCN (b). 
The XPS spectra (Fig. 4b) showed that there are C, N, O, Sn and Fe in the 1 wt% Fe-SCN composite. The Fe 3p, C 1s, N 1s, and Sn 3d orbitals of 1 wt% Fe-SCN have the same bonding characteristic peaks as SCN in the range of 290–500 eV, and the peak intensities of the Sn 4d, Sn 3d, and Sn 3p electron orbitals are much smaller than those in SCN. The weaker peak intensities of Sn in Fe-SCN indicated that Sn4+ ionic state decreases and part of Sn in crystal SnO2 has been replaced by Fe3+ that forms hybrid bonds with C, N and Sn.


3.2.2 Surface morphology and crystal plane structure. 
The Fe ions doped in SnO2 by chemical precipitation, which will not affect the unit cell parameters of SnO2, and it was also proved by XRD analysis in the previous section. As shown in Fig. 5a, CN has a porous layered structure with pore diameters around 10–50 nm. Fig. 5b and d show that 1 wt% Fe-SnO2 is a nanoparticle with diameters about 10–50 nm. Combined with XRD analysis, it can be clearly found that Fe-SnO2 has a regular crystal structure, while CN has a typical graphene-like structure. It is also easy to see from Fig. 5c and e that 1 wt% Fe-SCN is uniformly distributed on porous CN and in intimate contact with CN, which significantly increases the surface area of the composite material. The morphology of 1 wt% Fe-SCN under a HRTEM is shown in Fig. 5f. The image shows that the distance between the fringes of 1 wt% Fe-SnO2 is 0.33 nm, which corresponds to the (110) plane of rutile SnO2.36 In addition, there is a clear interface between 1 wt% Fe-SnO2 and porous CN, which suggests that Fe-SnO2 and porous CN form a heterojunction structure with close interface contact. Combined with the electronic orbital analysis by XPS, the 1 wt% Fe-SCN heterojunction material is not a physical mixture, and there are unique C, N, and Sn hybrid bonds at the interface. Therefore, 1 wt% Fe-SCN is a new interface nanomaterial with unique size, pore diameter and crystal orientation.

3.2.3 Band structure. 

Fig. 6a shows the photoresponse performance of CN and 1 wt% Fe-SnO2 measured by UV-vis diffuse reflectance. The results indicated that the absorption edges of CN and 1 wt% Fe-SnO2 are 459 nm and 400 nm, respectively. According to the Kubelka–Munk formula,37 the calculated CN band gap (Eg) is 2.7 eV, which is consistent with the previous report.38 The band gap of 1 wt% Fe-SnO2 is 3.1 eV, 0.43 eV lower than that of pure SnO2 (Eg = 3.53 eV). The narrowed band gap obviously improves the visible light response of pure SnO2.

Photogenerated electrons and holes need certain electrical potential energy to generate active radicals such as ˙O2− and ˙OH from O2 and H2O. Mott–Schottky tests were carried out to investigate the electrical potential energy of the electrons and holes photogenerated by 1 wt% Fe-SnO2 (Fig. 6b and c). The conduction band positions of CN and 1 wt% Fe-SnO2 are −1.78 and −0.88 V vs. Ag/AgCl, respectively. According to the following Nernst equation:39ENHE = EAg/AgCl + 0.6 V, the calculated conduction band positions correspond to −1.18 and −0.28 V vs. normal hydrogen electrodes (RHEs) respectively. The corresponding energy level diagram is shown in Fig. 10.

3.3 Photocatalytic sterilization mechanism
To further confirm the photocatalytic disinfection activity of the prepared samples, the morphologies of the E. coli and S. aureus untreated and treated with 1 wt% Fe-SCN were analyzed using SEM. Fig. 7a shows the image of untreated E. coli with the complete cell wall and cell membrane structure. The untreated E. coli presented in a complete and smooth normal rod-like morphology. In contrast, the E. coli cells exposed to a daylight lamp for 1 h with 1 wt% Fe-SCN (Fig. 7b) showed obvious depressions, and some cell morphologies were broken. The normal S. aureus cells without treatment (Fig. 7c) have neat edges, clear contours, full cells, smooth surface, and uniform spherical shape, while with the photocatalytic treatment, the S. aureus (Fig. 7d) showed unequal cell size and adhesion phenomenon, and some became not round and ruptured. The above-mentioned results indicated that 1 wt% Fe-SCN destroyed the cell wall of the bacteria, resulting in the loss of intracellular materials of the cells, eventually inactivating the bacteria. Our SEM observations on the damaged cell wall are consistent with other studies using BiVO4/Ag/g-C3N4,19 Ag QDs/Bi2S3/SnIn4S8,23 AgI/CuFe2O4,40 and Bi4O5I2/AgI.41

The enhanced sterilization performance of photocatalytic materials reported herein is attributed to the enhancement of photocatalytic activity by changing the energy band structure of photocatalytic materials, so that the corresponding concentrations of h+, ˙OH, ˙O2− and e− radicals are increased, thus enhancing the sterilization effect. The Z-scheme electron conduction mechanism is an authoritative mechanism for significantly improving the photocatalytic activity of heterojunctions. In terms of the sterilization mechanism, the present study only discusses the destruction of the bacterial cell (wall) membrane by free radicals, which leads to the death of the bacteria. Herein, the energy levels of photogenerated electrons, free radical generation and bacterial biochemical reactions of the photocatalytic sterilization process with the 1 wt% Fe-SCN heterojunction material are analyzed to further explore the mechanism of photocatalytic sterilization.
In order to explore the main free radicals responsible for the germicidal reaction of the 1 wt% Fe-SCN photocatalyst and further study the photocatalytic germicidal mechanism, TBA (tertiary butyl alcohol), EDTA-2Na (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid disodium salt) and BQ (1,4-benzoquinone) were used as capture agents for ˙OH, h+ and ˙O2− respectively in this experiment to determine bacterial inactivation. As shown in Fig. 8, the sterilization rate of 1 wt% Fe-SCN decreased noticeably after adding TBA and BQ, while with EDTA-2Na the decrease was slight. The results indicated that ˙OH and ˙O2− radicals play a major role in the photocatalytic germicidal process of Fe-SCN, and h+ is not the main free radical in this reaction.

In order to further study the formation mechanism of the effective bactericidal substances (˙OH and ˙O2−), the relative band positions of CN and 1 wt% Fe-SnO2 through the rule of electronegativity were investigated, as shown in Fig. 9. Through testing and calculation, it can be found that the conduction band potential ECB of CN is −1.18 eV, which is more negative than Eθ (O2/˙O2− = −0.33 eV vs. NHE).42 Therefore, in water, the electrons accumulated on the conduction band ECB of CN can easily reduce dissolved O2 on the surface of CN to ˙O2−. The potential of the CN valence band EVB is + 1.52 eV, which is less positive than Eθ (OH−/˙OH = 1.99 eV vs. NHE, H2O/˙OH = 2.27 eV vs. NHE).37 Therefore, the accumulated holes in the valence band EVB of CN cannot oxidize OH− and H2O on the surface of CN to ˙OH. Similarly, the 1 wt% Fe-SnO2 conduction band ECB is −0.28 eV, less negative than Eθ (O2/˙O2− = −0.33 eV vs. NHE), while the 1 wt% Fe-SnO2 valence band potential EVB is + 2.82 eV, more positive than Eθ (OH−/˙OH = 1.99 eV vs. NHE, H2O/˙OH = 2.27 eV vs. NHE), thus the electrons gathered on the conduction band ECB of the 1 wt% Fe-SnO2 heterojunction materials cannot reduce dissolved O2 on the surface of 1 wt% Fe-SnO2 to ˙O2−, while accumulated holes in the 1 wt% Fe-SnO2 valence band EVB can oxidize OH− and H2O on the surface to ˙OH. Then the accumulated electrons on the 1 wt% Fe-SnO2 conduction band can be transferred to the CN valence band and recombined with the accumulated holes on the CN valence band to achieve effective separation of photo-generated electrons and holes. Therefore, in the 1 wt% Fe-SCN heterojunction photocatalysis process, the electron–hole separation and conduction mechanism conforms to the Z-scheme mechanism.43,44
 Fig. 9  Photocatalytic sterilization mechanism of the 1 wt% Fe-SCN heterojunction material under visible light irradiation. 
According to the energy band position of 1 wt% Fe-SCN, free radical trapping experimental results and literature data, we proposed the sterilization mechanism of the Z-scheme charge conduction. As shown in Fig. 9, the sterilization process is described as follows: (1) photogeneration of electron–hole pairs; (2) formation of a large amount of ˙OH and ˙O2−; (3) rupture-destruction of cell wall biomolecular bonds; (4) entry of ˙OH and ˙O2− into the cells to react with functional macromolecules to destroy biological chemical bonds; and (5) bacterial death.
Under the irradiation of visible light, based on the excitation energy level analysis of the energy bands, CN and 1 wt% Fe-SnO2 are excited simultaneously to generate electron–hole pairs. In addition, photo-generated electrons from the CN and 1 wt% Fe-SnO2 valence bands are transferred to the corresponding conduction bands. In water, the accumulated electrons on the CN conduction band would capture and reduce the dissolved oxygen on the CN surface to ˙O2−,45 while the accumulated holes on the Fe-SnO2 valence band would oxidize OH− and H2O on the surface to ˙OH.46 In the meantime, doped Fe3+ can capture some electrons accumulated on the 1 wt% Fe-SnO2 conduction band to become Fe2+, and O2 in the system can oxidize Fe2+ to Fe3+ and ˙O2−.47,48 This cycle promotes the effective separation of photo-generated electrons and holes and reduces the loss of holes. These active radicals and cavities have strong oxidation and high reaction energy to react with most cell components of bacteria. The reaction energy of ˙OH is 120 kcal mol−1,49 which is higher than most chemical bonds composed of bacterial cells, such as hydrogen bonds (3.1–7.2 kcal mol−1)50 that maintain structural stability of bacterial DNA and protein, disulfide bonds (50.2 kcal mol−1)50 related to protein stability and biological activity, and chemical bonds composed of other organic compounds like C–C (83 kcal mol−1), C–H (99 kcal mol−1), CO (84 kcal mol−1) and H–O (111 kcal mol−1).49 At the same time, ˙OH can combine with itself to generate ˙OOH and H2O2,51 which also have strong oxidation capability. During photocatalytic sterilization, the reactive radicals generated by photocatalysis can break and decompose the molecular bonds of the above-mentioned organic compounds due to higher reaction energy, causing the structure of bacterial cell walls or cell membranes to be destroyed, as shown in Fig. 9. The destruction of the cell wall can be observed in the SEM images (Fig. 7) of bacteria. The reactive radicals would further penetrate into the cell to react with the functional macromolecules (proteins and nucleic acids) in the cell. ˙OH and ˙O2− would act on hydrogen bonds between bases in DNA double chains, destroying the double-helix structure of DNA and inhibiting DNA replication; or would act on protein disulfide bonds, which can cause natural conformational changes and loss of biological activity of proteins. These reactions will cause cell metabolism disorder and inactivate bacteria, thus achieving better sterilization effects.
3.4 Stability of the synthesized photocatalytic composites
SnO2 is a metal oxide with a stable chemical and rutile structure.52 The theoretical calculation of the chemical properties53 shows that SnO2 has excellent physical and chemical stabilities. XRD and XPS analyses show that doped Fe3+ did not change the crystal structure of SnO2, thus 1 wt% Fe-SCN maintained the stable chemical structure. However, g-C3N4 has a graphene-like structure (triazine, tri-s-triazine),54,55 which is very stable and only decomposes when the temperature exceeds 600 °C.56
The cycling experiments for the photocatalytic inactivation of E. coli by the 1 wt% Fe-SCN photocatalyst were conducted under the daylight lamp irradiation to investigate the application stability of 1 wt% Fe-SCN. After each cycle, the photocatalyst was collected via filtration, washing and drying for reuse in the next run. As shown in Fig. 10a, after three cycles, the inactivation efficiency of 1 wt% Fe-SCN for E. coli was not significantly reduced. In each cycle, the inactivation rate of E. coli reached 100% after 3 h of irradiation. To further demonstrate the stability and reusability of the as-prepared catalyst, SEM and TEM analyses of the used 1 wt% Fe-SCN (Fig. 10b and c) were carried out. Compared with the SEM (Fig. 5c) and TEM (Fig. 5e) analyses before sterilization, the morphology of 1 wt% Fe-SCN did not change significantly and the porous layer of this material was clearly observed. The SnO2 crystal was intact and 1 wt% Fe-SnO2 was still evenly distributed on CN, which also did not show any significant change in the morphology. The CN wrapped SnO2 with clear heterojunction interfaces. The above analyses indicate that the 1 wt% Fe-SCN photocatalyst has certain durability and stability to the photocatalytic disinfection.

4 Conclusion
The 1 wt% Fe-SCN heterojunction material prepared in this paper has obvious inactivation effects on the representative Gram-negative bacteria (E. coli) and Gram-positive bacteria (S. aureus) under the irradiation of near-ultraviolet light, simulated sunlight, daylight lamp and natural sunlight, among which 1 wt% Fe-SCN showed the strongest sterilization-enhancing ability under the irradiation of daylight lamp. For E. coli, the germicidal rate of 1 wt% Fe-SCN after the daylight lamp irradiation for 2 h reached 99.0%, which was 91.3% higher than that of the control group. Compared with the g-C3N4 (CN230)11 material, the photocatalytic germicidal activity was significantly improved, and the inactivation efficiency was higher than that of S. aureus. Through the free radical trapping experiments, it was found that the active free radicals that can effectively kill bacteria are ˙OH and ˙O2−.
Combining the analyses of the microstructural and electrical properties of 1 wt% Fe-SCN, based on the Z-scheme electron conduction mode, it was found that 1 wt% Fe-SCN decomposed in five steps to kill bacteria, and the Z-scheme charge sterilization mechanism was proposed. Research showed that part of Sn in the Fe-SCN heterojunction is replaced by Fe3+, and unique C, N, Sn hybrid bonds are formed at the heterojunction interface, which further changes the energy band structure of SnO2 and CN. The unique pore size, crystal orientation and heterogeneous structure of the interface improve the visible light response performance. It was observed that 1 wt% Fe-SCN has higher potential energy difference of light energy conversion, and that it generates radicals ˙OH and ˙O2− with sufficient energy, which is far greater than the reaction energy of some components of the bacterial cell wall and sufficient to break disulfide bonds, C–C, C–H, CO, and H–O and the like of cell organisms and destroy the chemical structure of functional macromolecules (proteins and nucleic acids). In addition, Fe3+ doping promotes the anisotropic growth characteristics of the material, so that Fe-SnO2 is uniformly distributed on porous CN, thus improving the surface area of the 1 wt% Fe-SCN composite and enhancing the photocatalytic sterilization efficiency. The cycle experiment of photocatalytic sterilization showed that 1 wt% Fe-SCN has good stability.
