    , Accepted 14th March 2016First published on 14th March 2016AbstractA FeNiOOH-decorated hematite photoanode has been prepared using a facile electrodeposition method, with a significant cathodic shift of the onset potential (up to 190 mV) compared to the pristine sample. Synchrotron radiation based techniques have been used to identify the composition of the catalyst indicating the presence of FeOOH and NiOOH (FeNiOOH). The enhanced performance can be attributed to the better oxidation evolution reaction kinetics with the FeNiOOH cocatalyst. The FeNiOOH-decorated hematite is very stable for a long time. Moreover, the cocatalyst can be well coupled to the Pt-modified hematite photoanode achieving a high photocurrent of 2.21 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE. The good catalytic properties and the facile preparation method suggest that the decoration of FeNiOOH is a favorable strategy to improve the performance of hematite.
Introduction
Hematite has been recently considered to be a good photocatalyst for solar water splitting due to its favorable optical band gap, good stability in the oxidative environment, abundance, and low cost.1–5 The theoretical performance of hematite can be very high with a solar-to-hydrogen efficiency of 16.8% and a water splitting photocurrent of 12.6 mA cm−2.1–10 However, its practical performance is far away from the ideal case due to many factors such as poor conductivity, slow oxygen evolution reaction (OER) kinetics, short hole diffusion length (2–4 nm), and improper band position for unassisted water splitting.1–10
Various methods have been developed to improve the performance of hematite.6–25 In particular, a low onset potential has been considered to be very important.2,6,10 The onset potential originates from the improper band position of hematite and basically an external bias about 0.4 V vs. RHE has to be applied for water oxidation.10 Unfortunately, the poor OER kinetics and the low conductivity of hematite typically require additional bias for effective water oxidation.2,6,10 Thus the lowering of the onset potential is required for the high performance of hematite. Many methods have been recently used to reduce the onset potential and the decoration of surface catalysts on hematite is considered to be very effective.2,6,10 For example, the IrO2 catalyst has been used to lower the onset potential and achieve a high plateau photocurrent of 3.75 mA cm−2.10 The Co–Pi catalyst was also widely used to significantly reduce the onset potential of hematite.6,12,19
It is well known that Fe and Ni based cocatalysts show very good OER properties.24–29 Thus these kinds of materials have great potential to be coupled with hematite to achieve high performance. Actually, various Fe and Ni based catalysts have already been decorated on hematite to improve the OER process.20–25 For example, FeOOH nanostructures were deposited on hematite to effectively lower the onset potential of hematite.20 NiOOH and Ni(OH)2 catalysts were also separately reported to improve the performance of hematite.21–23 Recently, an optically transparent Fe and Ni cocatalyst prepared using a photo-assisted electrodeposition method was reported to significantly lower the onset potential and improve the photocurrent of the hematite photoanode.25 According to the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results, the catalyst was assigned to a combination of FeOOH and Ni(OH)2.25
Here we show a facile electrodeposition method to prepare the cocatalyst of FeOOH and NiOOH (labeled as FeNiOOH) on hematite, which significantly lower the onset potential with a large value of 190 mV. By using synchrotron radiation based techniques, the composition of FeOOH and NiOOH in the cocatalyst can be clearly identified, obviously different from the catalysts reported in the literatures.20–25 Moreover, the FeNiOOH cocatalyst can be well coupled to the Pt-decorated hematite to achieve a high photocurrent of 2.21 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE. FeOOH or NiOOH catalysts alone typically show their capability of lowering the onset potential on hematite samples with relatively low performance and the final photocurrents are not high enough (lower than 1.7 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE).20–23 Our results suggest that the FeNiOOH cocatalyst is also very effective for a high performance hematite photoanode, which might be used for practical application in the future.
Experimental section
Hematite photoanode preparation
Pristine hematite photoanodes were prepared using a modified hydrothermal method grown on a fluorine-doped SnO2 (FTO, Nippon Sheet Glass, Japan, 14 ohm sq−1) glass substrate.11,13 Briefly, 80 ml of aqueous solution containing 75 mM ferric chloride (FeCl3·6H2O) and 0.1 M glucose (C6H12O6) was filled in a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave. The autoclave with a cleaned FTO glass slide (50 mm × 30 mm × 2 mm) was heated in an oven at 95 °C for 4 h to produce FeOOH. After washing, the FeOOH-coated FTO slide was sintered in air at 550 °C for 2 h and at 750 °C for additional 15 min. The product was labeled as the pristine hematite.
To prepare Pt-modified hematite, the ethanol solutions of H2PtCl6 (various concentrations in a range of 2–10 × 10−8 M) were used to drop on the FeOOH films and then the samples were sintered in air at 550 °C for 2 h and at 750 °C for additional 15 min. The product was labeled as the Pt-modified hematite.
To prepare the FeNiOOH-decorated hematite, a modified electrodeposition technique was used.9 Electrodeposition was performed in a three-electrode photoelectrochemical (PEC) cell, in which a Pt wire, a Ag/AgCl electrode saturated with KCl and the hematite photoanode were used as the counter, reference and working electrodes, respectively. An aqueous solution containing 5 mM FeCl3, 3 mM NiCl2, 5 mM NaF, 0.1 M KCl and 1 M H2O2 after magnetic stirring for 10 minutes was used as the electrolyte. An electrochemical workstation (CHI 660D) was used to perform cyclic voltammetry for the deposition of FeNiOOH catalysts on hematite. The applied voltage was between −0.49 and 0.41 V vs. Ag/AgCl at a scan rate of 0.2 V s−1. Three cycles were good enough to get the best PEC performance. Then the FeNiOOH-decorated hematite films were washed by DI water and dried. To prepare FeOOH or NiOOH decorated hematite samples, similar procedures were used except for the different electrolytes without NiCl2 or FeCl3, respectively.
Structural characterization
A scanning electron microscope (Zeiss-supra 55), X-ray diffraction (XRD, PANalytical, Empyrean) and an X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS, Kratos AXIS UltraDLD) were used to characterize the structure. X-ray absorption spectra were collected at the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF, 14W) (hard-X-ray) and the Beijing Synchrotron Radiation Facility (BSRF, 4B7B) (soft-X-ray). High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images were obtained using a FEI/Philips Techai 12 Bio-TWIN transmission electron microscope.
Photoelectrochemical experiments
Hematite photoanodes were measured with a working area of about 0.1 cm2 and the left part was covered by non-conductive hysol epoxy. The PEC measurements were performed by using an electrochemical workstation (CHI 660D). The pH value of the electrolyte (1 M NaOH) was controlled to be about 13.6. The measured voltage was finally converted into the potential vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). The light source was a Xenon High Brightness Cold Light Sources (XD-300) equipped with AM 1.5 filter. The light power density was controlled to be 100 mW cm−2. The IPCE data were measured using a xenon lamp (CEL-HXF300/CEL-HXBF300, 300 W) coupled with a monochromator (Omni-λ3005). The electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) under illumination (AM 1.5, 100 mW cm−2) were collected by an electrochemical workstation (CHI 660D). The voltage pulse with an amplitude of 10 mV was applied at the potential of 1.0 V vs. RHE, with a frequency that ranged from 100 kHz to 0.1 Hz.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1 shows the scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of the pristine and FeNiOOH-decorated hematite nanostructures. The decoration of FeNiOOH on hematite was performed by using a modified electrodeposition method.9 It is a facile method without the assistance of light and can be completed in a few min (the CV curves for the electrodeposition of FeNiOOH have been shown in the ESI,† S1). The pristine sample is a thin film of nanorods on the FTO substrate.13–15 After the decoration of FeNiOOH catalysts, no obvious difference can be found from the SEM images in Fig. 1. Fig. 2 shows the HRTEM images of the pristine and FeNiOOH-decorated hematite nanostructures. The crystal lines in both samples confirm the hematite crystal structure. However, the FeNiOOH-decorated sample shows a very thin amorphous coating layer (a few nm) on the hematite nanostructures, indicating the successful deposition of FeNiOOH. The ESI,† S2 also shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) data of the pristine and FeNiOOH-decorated samples, which exhibit a typical hematite structure (JCPDS 33-0664). There is no additional XRD feature for the FeNiOOH-decorated hematite nanostructures due to the amorphous nature of the coating layer.

Fig. 3a shows the photocurrent density-applied potential (J–V) scans of the pristine and FeNiOOH-decorated (labeled as Fe2O3/FeNiOOH) hematite photoanodes. The pristine hematite photoanode shows a typical photocurrent of 0.87 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE for the untreated hematite sample prepared using the hydrothermal method.13–15 An onset potential of around 0.76 V vs. RHE can be observed for the pristine sample. However, a significant cathodic shift of the onset potential and thus an enhancement of the photocurrent (1.11 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE) can be found in the FeNiOOH-decorated hematite photoanode. To carefully examine the onset potential shift, we have analyzed the J–V curves and shown the first-order derivative curves in Fig. 3b. The onset potential is defined as the value at which dJ/dV is equal to 0.2 mA cm−2 V−1 (indicated by the black line).24 The measured onset potential for the pristine sample is 0.76 V vs. RHE, while it is 0.57 V vs. RHE for the FeNiOOH-decorated sample. A big cathodic shift of 190 mV can thus be observed suggesting that the decorated FeNiOOH is a very good catalyst to lower the onset potential of hematite. The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiencies (IPCE) data of the pristine and FeNiOOH-decorated hematite photoanodes are also shown in the ESI,† S3 (at 1.23 V vs. RHE). An obvious enhancement of the IPCE data can be found for the FeNiOOH-decorated sample, which is consistent with the improved J–V curve. The photochemical stability curve of the FeNiOOH hematite photoanode (at 1.23 V vs. RHE) is shown in the ESI,† S4, suggesting very good stability over 3 h. The photocurrent also slightly increases with time, which could be attributed to the passivation of surface trapping states by anodic healing of the oxygen vacancies under PEC conditions.8 It is well known that Fe and Ni based cocatalysts have good OER properties which may help the solar water oxidation process of hematite.26–29 Recently, FeOOH or NiOOH catalysts prepared using various methods were independently reported which could be coupled to hematite with good catalytic properties.20–23 The cocatalyst of Fe and Ni oxides (FeNiOx) and the hybrid of FeOOH and Ni(OH)2 were also reported with good performance.24,25 However, to the best of our knowledge, the effective cocatalyst of FeOOH and NiOOH to significantly improve the performance of hematite has not been reported yet. To clearly identify the composition in our catalyst, XPS and synchrotron radiation based techniques are used.

XPS data have been shown in the ESI,† S5. The survey spectrum in Fig. S5a (ESI†) shows clear Fe and O signals indicating the hematite structure. Additional Sn and C signals can be observed which are from the diffusion of the FTO substrate and carbon contaminations, respectively.13,15 Three peaks can be observed in the O 1s XPS spectrum in Fig. S5b (ESI†). The first peak at around 530.3 eV can be attributed to Fe–O bonds in hematite while the second peak at around 531.8 eV can be assigned to hydroxide in FeOOH or NiOOH.22,25 The third small peak at 533 eV can be related to adsorbed H2O.25 From the strong peak at around 531.8 eV we confirm the presence of hydroxide. Fig. S5c (ESI†) shows the Fe 2p signal but it cannot well identify the signal of the FeOOH catalyst from hematite. In Fig. S5d (ESI†) the spectrum shows a weak Ni signal confirming the existence of Ni. However, the Ni 2p signal shows an energy position at around 856 eV, which should be assigned to Ni3+ in NiOOH instead of Ni2+ (855.5 eV) in Ni(OH)2.25
Further evidence to identify the composition in the catalyst can be found in Fig. 4 with the synchrotron radiation based X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) results.26,30,31Fig. 4a shows the Fe L-edge XAS spectra of the pristine and FeNiOOH-decorated hematite photoanodes. The FeNiOOH-decorated hematite shows a chemical state similar to the pristine hematite (Fe3+), except for a decrease of the shoulder peak at about 708 eV (labeled by an arrow). The difference can be attributed to the presence of FeOOH with different Fe environments. Fig. 4b shows the Ni L-edge XAS spectra of the NiCl2 standard sample and the FeNiOOH-decorated hematite photoanode. XAS is more sensitive than XPS and here the Ni signal can be clearly observed confirming the existence of Ni in the cocatalyst. NiCl2 has been used as the precursor of Ni to form FeNiOOH. However, the FeNiOOH-decorated hematite shows an obvious energy shift to a higher position, indicating a higher chemical state such as Ni3+ in the catalyst.30 It should be NiOOH when considering the observation of hydroxide in the XPS data.25 The catalyst can thus be assigned to the combination of FeOOH and NiOOH (defined as the cocatalyst of FeNiOOH). More evidence of the Ni chemical state can be found in Fig. 4d with the hard X-ray XAS results. The Fourier transform curve of the XAS spectrum in the extended region (Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure, EXAFS) has been shown in Fig. 4d, with a comparison to Ni(OH)2 and Ni2O3 standard samples. The peak around 1.5 Å can be attributed to Ni–O bonds.26,31 However, the peak positions are different for the three samples. The FeNiOOH-decorated sample shows a position similar to that of Ni2O3, obviously lower than that of Ni(OH)2. The lower position indicates shorter Ni–O bonds and confirms that it is NiOOH in the cocatalyst instead of Ni(OH)2.26,31Fig. 4c shows the O K-edge XAS spectra of the pristine, FeOOH-decorated and FeNiOOH-decorated hematite photoanodes. Two separated prepeaks A1 and A2 and a main peak B can be observed for the pristine hematite. The prepeaks can be assigned to the O 2p states hybridized with Fe 3d metal states (t2g and eg orbital symmetry), while the main peak B can be attributed to oxygen 2p states hybridized with iron 4s and 4p states.17,32 After the decoration of FeOOH, the prepeaks decrease a lot and a new peak B1 for O–H bonds can be observed,33 suggesting the presence of FeOOH. Moreover, after the decoration of FeNiOOH, a peak labeled as A3 can be observed ascribed to Ni–O bonds.30 The results strongly suggest that a FeNiOOH layer has been successfully decorated on the hematite photoanode, which exhibits good OER catalytic properties and then improve the performance of hematite.

We also prepared the FeOOH or NiOOH catalyst alone on the pristine hematite using a similar electrodeposition method (the preparation method can be found in the Experimental section). Although FeOOH or NiOOH decorated hematite photoanodes also show improved performance with a cathodic shift of the onset potential, they are unstable and the photocurrents decrease a lot after 20 min (ESI,† S6). The experimental results suggest that using this facile electrodeposition method the cocatalyst of FeNiOOH should be the best choice to improve the performance of hematite. The experimental conditions such as the deposition cycles and the concentration of the precursors have also been optimized to get the best performance (ESI,† S7 and S8).
To further explore the catalytic effect of FeNiOOH, we coupled the catalyst to Pt-modified hematite photoanode with a high performance. Pt was reported to be a very effective element to improve the photocurrent of hematite.34–36 The decoration process of Pt is described in the experimental section. The experimental setup can be found in the ESI,† S9. Fig. 5a shows the J–V curves of the pristine and Pt-modified hematite photoanodes. It is clear that after Pt-modification the photocurrent of hematite can be greatly enhanced, especially at the concentration of 2.5 × 10−8 M showing a photocurrent value of 1.80 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE. In the ESI,† S10 we show the SEM and TEM images of the pristine and Pt-modified hematite nanostructures. The morphology has not been changed after Pt-modification and there is no coating layer on both samples. In the ESI,† S11 we also show the Pt L3-edge XAS spectra of the Pt foil, H2PtCl6 and the Pt-modified hematite photoanode. The Pt-modified hematite shows a sharp white line peak A and a broad peak B, which is similar to oxidized Pt such as H2PtCl6 or PtO2. The oxidized Pt in the Pt-modified hematite shows high catalytic efficiency to improve the performance of hematite nanostructures.34–36 Interestingly, the performance of the Pt-modified hematite can be further improved after the loading of FeNiOOH. Fig. 5b shows the J–V curves of the Pt-modified (2.5 × 10−8 M) hematite photoanodes before and after the decoration of FeNiOOH. The FeNiOOH-decorated photoanode shows an obvious cathodic shift (more than 120 mV) of the onset potential with a low value of 0.67 V vs. RHE. The photocurrent is significantly enhanced with a high value of 2.21 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE. The slightly worse onset potential compared to the Fe2O3/FeNiOOH sample can be attributed to the original sample difference (different onset potential and photocurrent) and possible influence from the Pt modification on the surface. The results suggest that the FeNiOOH catalyst is very effective and can be applied to the sample with a high performance for further enhancement.

To explore the working mechanism of the FeNiOOH cocatalyst, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) under the light illumination has been measured revealing details of the charge transfer process. The EIS data of the pristine, Pt-modified and FeNiOOH-decorated/Pt-modified hematite photoanodes have been shown as the form of Nyquist plots in Fig. 6 (the parameters of equivalent circuit elements in EIS have been shown in the ESI,† Table S1). The equivalent circuit (EC) to simulate the Nyquist plot is also shown in the inset.37 The curve of the Pt-modified hematite photoanode exhibits a smaller diameter compared to that of the pristine hematite photoanode, while the curve of the FeNiOOH-decorated/Pt-modified photoanode shows the smallest diameter among all three samples. The diameter in EIS can be related to the charge transfer resistance and the smaller diameter stands for faster charge transfer kinetics at the electrode interface.20,37 Thus the smaller diameter for the Pt-modified hematite photoanode means the enhanced charge transfer kinetics at the electrode interface which may significantly improve the performance of hematite. Moreover, the diameter in EIS can be further decreased when decorating the FeNiOOH cocatalyst, which suggests the decreased resistance between the FeNiOOH/electrolyte interface when compared to that between the pristine hematite/electrolyte interface.20 The results show that the FeNiOOH cocatalyst would decrease the charge transfer barrier at the electrode interface and then reduce the OER barrier; thus a cathodic shift of the onset potential can be observed with enhanced performance.

Conclusions
The FeNiOOH cocatalyst has been decorated on hematite using a facile electrodeposition method. Compared to the pristine sample, the FeNiOOH-decorated hematite shows a large cathodic shift of the onset potential up to 190 mV. The improved performance can be assigned to the enhanced OER kinetics by FeNiOOH. The photocurrent is also significantly improved and it is very stable for a long time. Moreover, the FeNiOOH cocatalyst can be coupled to the Pt-modified hematite photoanode to achieve a high photocurrent of 2.21 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE. XPS and synchrotron radiation based techniques are used to identify the composition of the cocatalyst and the results suggest it to be a hybrid of FeOOH and NiOOH. Our data show that the FeNiOOH cocatalyst might be widely used to improve the performance of hematite for water oxidation.
