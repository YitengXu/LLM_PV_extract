DRSBDT-2OT, with an acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) structure, exhibits a high molecular planarity via noncovalent intramolecular S⋯O interactions, leading to comparatively low reorganization energy and high hole mobility. Owing to the surface passivation effects of DRSBDT-2OT in the mixed HTM and the increased hole mobility in comparison with the spiro-OMeTAD, the mixed HTM-based device exhibits a significantly enhanced efficiency of 21.31%, which is much higher than that of single-component HTM-based devices. Furthermore, the mixed HTM-based devices are much more stable than the control devices that use Sprio-OMeTAD as the HTM. These findings pave the way for the rational design of planar hole-transport materials for mixed HTMs toward efficient and stable perovskite solar cells.
Introduction
Metal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are an emerging photovoltaic technology due to their advantages, such as low cost, high performance and ease of fabrication of large scale flexible devices; in addition, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) have been improved from 3.8% in 2009 to over 25% very recently.1–8 Hole transporting materials (HTMs) play an important role in conventionally structured perovskite solar cells, such as hole extraction, surface passivation, suppressing charge recombination and preventing the perovskite layer from moisture/oxygen.9–11 So far, the most widely used HTMs in conventional structure perovskite solar cells are 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis-(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spiro-bifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) and poly-triarylamine (PTAA), which suffer from low mobility and conductivity of the neat film due to their amorphous structure, thus requiring chemical doping.12,13 The incorporation of hygroscopic dopants such as 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP) or lithium bis(trifluoromethyl sulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) not only increases the complexity for device fabrication but also triggers the degradation of the perovskite, as the moisture may penetrate the perovskite film through the doped HTMs. Considering these drawbacks, it is urgent to develop alternative HTMs to solve these problems and further improve the photovoltaic performance.
The development of hydrophobic and dopant-free HTMs has the potential to produce highly efficient PSCs with facile processability and long-term stability.14,15 Various dopant-free HTMs for PSCs have been designed and synthesized in the past few years.16–21 Conjugated small molecules with push–pull chromophores could be a promising candidate for HTMs as they have been widely studied for use in organic electronics such as organic solar cells (OSCs) and organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) due to their advantages such as tunable energy levels, high hole mobility and conductivity, and good film quality.22 Compared to star HTMs, such as spiro-OMeTAD, conjugated small molecule-based HTMs typically exhibit better hydrophobicity and higher mobility due to their rigid planar structure. The high molecule planarity is a key factor to maintain the high mobility of the molecules as it extends π-electron delocalization along the molecular backbone and facilitates intermolecular π–π stacking.17,23 One efficient method to increase the planarity of small molecules is to introduce heteroatoms such as O, S, Se, F-containing units to connect the adjacent aromatic rings via intramolecular noncovalent interactions, which can restrain the rotation of the single bonds between adjacent aromatic units and has been widely studied for designing organic photovoltaic materials.23–25 Moreover, heteroatoms such as O, S, Se, and F can also passivate the surface trap state of perovskite films, resulting in a reduced charge recombination loss. However, the introduction of intramolecular noncovalent interactions for the design of HTMs for perovskite solar cells has rarely been studied. Furthermore, although dopant-free HTM-based devices exhibit better stability than spiro-OMeTAD, photovoltaic devices with PCEs over 20% are quite rare to date and are still inferior to spiro-OMeTAD-based conventional devices.20,21,26 The development of PSCs with high PCEs and good stability for commercialization in the future is still challenging work. Consequently, it could be a promising strategy to develop mixed HTMs for perovskite solar cells to combine the advantages of the high efficiency of spiro-OMeTAD or PTAA-based devices and the high stability of dopant-free HTM-based devices.
In this study, a simple and facile way to improve the efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells was developed using mixed hole transport materials, which were composed of spiro-OMeTAD and our developed conjugated small molecule, DRSBDT-2OT (Fig. 1a). The DRSBDT-2OT, with its acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) structure, exhibits a high molecular planarity via noncovalent intramolecular S⋯O interactions, resulting in a comparatively low reorganization energy and improved hole mobility. By mixing DRSBDT-2OT with spiro-OMeTAD, the mixed HTM shows dramatically improved hydrophobicity and superior water resistance, which could efficiently protect the perovskite film. Owing to the surface passivation effects of DRSBDT-2OT in the mixed HTM and the increased hole mobility in comparison with the spiro-OMeTAD, the mixed HTM-based device exhibits higher charge recombination resistance (Rrec), lower charge transport resistance (Rct) and sharply reduced interface defects. Compared to the single-component HTM-based devices, which exhibit PCEs of 17.13% and 19.04% for the dopant-free DRSBDT-2OT and doped spiro-OMeTAD-based devices, respectively, the photovoltaic device based on the mixed HTM exhibits a significantly enhanced PCE of 21.31%. Furthermore, the mixed HTM-based devices are much more stable than the control device using spiro-OMeTAD as the HTM due to the enhanced hydrophobicity and water resistance.

Results and discussion
The synthesis route of the A–D–A type small molecule, DRSBDT-2OT, with noncovalent intramolecular S⋯O interactions is shown in Scheme 1. The alkoxy-substituted thiophene derivative 6 is a key intermediate, which was synthesized via a four-step reaction starting from 3-((2-ethylhexyl)oxy)thiophene (1) using formylation, bromination, Stille coupling and bromination reactions in sequence. The dialdehyde compound 9 with noncovalent intramolecular S⋯O interactions was obtained from a Stille coupling reaction between compound 6 and 5,5′-bis(trimethylstannyl)-benzo[1,2-b;4,5-b′]dithiophene (8) in the presence of Pd(PPh3)4 as the catalyst. Finally, the target molecule was obtained by the Knoevenagel condensation of the dialdehyde compound 9 with 2-(3-oxo-2,3-dihydroinden-1-ylidene)-malononitrile (INCN) in a yield of 78%. This molecule has good solubility in most common organic solvents such as chloroform, dichloromethane, and dichlorobenzene. The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) profile (Fig. S2†) reveals that the decomposition temperature (Td) at a 5% weight loss is 351 °C in a nitrogen atmosphere, suggesting the good thermal stability of DRSBDT-2OT.
 Scheme 1  Synthesis route of DRSBDT-2OT. 
To have a better insight into the electronic structure and geometry of DRSBDT-2OT, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were carried out, and the alkyl chains were replaced by ethyl groups to simplify the calculations. The DFT-calculated highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO)/lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels are −4.85 and −3.26 eV, respectively, and the respective frontier orbital distributions are shown in Fig. 1b. Due to the noncovalent intramolecular S⋯O interactions, the optimized molecular geometries show excellent flat geometries (Fig. S1†), which facilitate efficient charge transport due to the enhanced intermolecular π–π stacking. The reorganization energy of DRSBDT-2OT was calculated based on the anatomy of a Marcus-type electron-transfer mechanism.27 Owing to the excellent backbone planarity, DRSBDT-2OT shows a lower reorganization energy (213 meV), which is much lower than that of spiro-OMeTAD (495 meV), indicating the faster hole-transport in DRSBDT-2OT.28,29 These results are consistent with the improved hole mobility determined by the space charge limited current (SCLC) measurement discussed below. The electrostatic potential (ESP) of the simplified molecular models of DRSBDT-2OT was further calculated using the DFT method to study the static charge distribution around the molecule. As shown in Fig. 1c, the positive electrostatic potential (in blue color) mainly localizes in the conjugated backbone, particularly in the alkoxy thiophene π-bridge, while strong electronegative atoms such as oxygen and nitrogen in the Lewis base carbonyl (CO) and cyano (CN) groups of the end group concentrate negative charges (in red color). Therefore, the carbonyl and cyano groups are expected to passivate the perovskite surface through coordination with the uncoordinated Pb, as illustrated in Fig. 1d.30–32 Moreover, the S heteroatoms in the thiophene units and side chains of the molecule could also passivate the Pb–I antisite defects on the perovskite surface due to the strong Pb2+–S interactions (Fig. 1d).33–36 We further studied the interactions of perovskite with DRSBDT-2OT via Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). As shown in Fig. S5,† the bands at 1717 cm−1 and 2216 cm−1 are assigned to the stretching vibrations of the CO bonds (ν(CO)), and CN bonds (ν(CN)) for pristine DRSBDT-2OT, respectively. The peak present at 890 cm−1 is attributed to the symmetric C–S stretching mode.37 We found that there are obvious shifts in the stretching vibration frequencies for the CO, CN, and C–S bonds that resulted from the electron delocalization when a Lewis base–acid adduct was formed. For example, the bands for the stretching vibration frequency of the CO bonds shifted from 1717 cm−1 to 1626 cm−1, demonstrating an interaction between Pb2+ and CO.38 Note that a weak band at ∼1620 cm−1 in the control perovskite film (Fig. S5†) is typically ascribed to a flexural vibration mode of H2O.39 In comparison with the intensity of the CC bonds in the FTIR, the band at 1626 cm−1 could be assigned to the stretching vibration frequency of the CO bonds that include the flexural vibration of H2O.
The normalized UV-vis absorption spectra of DRSBDT-2OT in the CHCl3 solution and solid films are displayed in Fig. S3a,† and the detailed data are presented in Table S1.† Compared to the solution spectrum, which shows an absorption peak at 675 nm, the absorption spectra of the DRSBDT-2OT film display a red-shifted peak at 736 nm, suggesting strong intermolecular π–π stacking interactions in the film due to its coplanar backbone. The optical bandgap of the film was calculated to be 1.53 eV from the onset of the band edge absorption. The energy level was investigated via electrochemical cyclic voltammetry (Fig. S3c†), and the HOMO level of DRSBDT-2OT was estimated to be −5.09 eV, which was slightly deeper than that of spiro-OMeTAD (−4.84 eV). A deeper HTM HOMO is beneficial for improving the interfacial band alignment and suppressing the energy loss in perovskite solar cells, leading to an increase in the open circuit voltage (VOC).26 To evaluate the device performance of these HTM-based conventionally structured perovskite solar cells, photovoltaic devices with a configuration of ITO/SnO2/perovskite/HTM/MoO3/Ag were fabricated (Fig. 2a). The current density–voltage (J–V) curves for the optimized devices are shown in Fig. 2b, and the corresponding data are summarized in Table 1. The dopant-free DRSBDT-2OT-based device achieved a PCE of 17.13%, a VOC of 1.09 V, a short-circuit current (JSC) of 22.84 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 68.81%. This efficiency is good relative to other conventional devices using HTM without any dopant, but it is still lower than that of the control device with doped spiro-OMeTAD HTM, which exhibits a PCE of 19.04%. By using the composite of DRSBDT-2OT and spiro-OMeTAD as the mixed HTM, the PCE of the optimized device dramatically improved to 21.31% with a small hysteresis (Fig. S6†), coupled with a VOC of 1.10 V, a high JSC of 23.67 mA cm−2, and a very notable FF of 81.85%. The enhanced VOC could be attributed to the deep HOMO level of DRSBDT-2OT in the mixed HTM, which could also passivate the surface trap state, as discussed above. As shown in Fig. 2c, the integrated JSC values of the devices using different HTMs are consistent with the values obtained from J–V measurements. The high performance of the mixed HTM-based device was further confirmed by the stabilized power output recording at the maximum power point, and a stabilized efficiency of 21.0% over 100 s was achieved (Fig. 2d). Moreover, the detailed statistical photovoltaic performance parameters show that the performance of the photovoltaic devices with mixed HTM exhibit very good reproducibility (Fig. S8 and S9†), indicating the constructive effects of the planar conjugated molecule DRSBDT-2OT in the mixed HTM-based devices.

To further study the charge carrier recombination kinetics, the power law dependences of JSC and VOC on light intensity over 16 to 100 mW cm−2 for the corresponding photovoltaic devices were measured. The JSCversus light intensity exhibits a linear relation in the double-logarithmic scale, as shown in Fig. 2e. The fitted slopes (α) are 0.948, 0.944 and 0.997 for the devices using spiro-OMeTAD, DRSBDT-2OT and mixed HTM as HTMs, respectively, indicating a negligible bimolecular recombination and space charge effect in the mixed HTM-based devices. Fig. 2f shows the linear relationship between the VOC and natural logarithm of the light intensity. The slopes for the spiro-OMeTAD, DRSBDT-2OT and mixed HTM-based devices are 1.83, 2.27 and 1.62 kT/q, respectively, indicating a reduced trap-assisted Shockley–Read–Hall recombination in mixed HTM-based devices.40 The decreased recombination in the mixed HTM-based devices could be attributed to the high-quality HTM films, which effectively reduces the interfacial defects.41
The hole mobility of the spiro-OMeTAD, DRSBDT-2OT and mixed HTM was measured using the SCLC method. As shown in Fig. 3a, the calculated hole mobility value of the mixed HTM device is 1.48 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is slightly lower than that of the neat DRSBDT-2OT device (1.70 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) but exceeds that of the doped spiro-OMeTAD device (1.08 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1), suggesting that the incorporation of DRSBDT-2OT into spiro-OMeTAD to form the mixed HTM could effectively improve the mobility of spiro-OMeTAD-based devices. Moreover, the film quality was improved for the mixed HTM device, which exhibits a smoother and more homogeneous surface with a root-mean-square roughness (RMS) of 11.5 nm compared to that with spiro-OMeTAD with an RMS of 14.3 nm (Fig. S11†). The hole extraction capability of HTMs was investigated via steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TPL) measurements. Fig. 3b displays the steady-state PL spectra of perovskite films without and with the HTM capping layer. Upon excitation at 475 nm, the PL of perovskite was quenched sharply upon capping with different HTMs. As shown in Fig. 3b, the PL intensity was reduced to ∼1.6% and 3.2% to that of the pristine perovskite films with spiro-OMeTAD and DRSBDT-2OT capped films, respectively. Only 0.3% of the pristine perovskite PL intensity was left for the mixed HTM capped film, suggesting that the mixed HTM could quench the PL of perovskite more efficiently in comparison with those of the single-component HTMs. Moreover, the PL peak of the perovskite covered with DRSBDT-2OT and mixed HTM showed 7 nm and 6 nm blue-shifts compared with that of the neat perovskite film (Fig. S4†), which agrees well with the expectation that DRSBDT-2OT can passivate the traps at the surface by filling the deep traps or shifting the deep traps to shallow traps.42 The TPL in Fig. 3c shows that the perovskite film exhibits a much longer lifetime, while the PL lifetimes of the HTM-capped perovskite films are very short, indicating an efficient charge-carrier transfer at the perovskite/HTM interface.43

To understand the effects of different HTMs on charge carrier dynamics in the PSCs, we performed transient photovoltage (TPV) and transient photocurrent (TPC) measurements. As shown in Fig. 3d, the carrier lifetime of the device using the mixed HTM was determined to be to 49.3 μs, while the devices based on single-component HTMs showed lower carrier lifetimes of 36.3 μs for spiro-OMeTAD and 26.9 μs for DRSBDT-2OT. The long charge carrier lifetime supports the reduced interface trap states and the hindered carrier recombination in the mixed HTM-based devices. The TPC results show that the device using mixed HTM exhibited a much shorter photocurrent decay time than that of the DRSBDT-2OT and spiro-OMeTAD-based devices, indicating that the hole extraction has been significantly improved for the mixed HTM-based devices, which is consistent with the TPL results discussed above. Note that both the TPL and TPC results indicate efficient hole extraction between perovskite and HTM. The different lifetimes between the TPL and TPC are related to the different test methods and instruments.
To gain more insight into the carrier recombination in the devices using different HTMs, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were conducted on the completed devices. Fig. 3f shows the Nyquist plots of the solar cells tested in dark, and the detailed data are presented in Table S4.† The arc in the higher frequency region represents the charge transport resistance (Rct), whereas the main arc in the lower frequency region reveals the charge recombination resistance (Rrec).44–46 Note that the only difference between these devices is the HTMs. Thus, the changes in the EIS could be attributed to the carrier transport and contact resistance in the interface or bulk of various HTMs. It was observed that the mixed HTM-based device had an Rrec of 265.24 Ω, which is larger than spiro-OMeTAD (151.33 Ω) and DRSBDT-2OT (139.22 Ω) based devices. The estimated Rct values are 323.21, 523.28 and 258.92 Ω for the spiro-OMeTAD, DRSBDT-2OT and mixed HTM-based devices, respectively. The higher Rrec and lower Rct for the devices based on the mixed HTM compared to those with single-component HTMs signify a lower recombination and more efficient charge transport at the interfaces or the bulk due to the high film quality and reduced defects, resulting in a higher VOC and FF, which is consistent with the photovoltaic performance measured above. As the hydrophobicity of the HTMs plays an important role in protecting the perovskite from moisture, we probed the water wetting behavior of the spiro-OMeTAD, DRSBDT-2OT and mixed HTM films with the glass/ITO/SnO2/perovskite as substrates through water contact angle tests. As shown in Fig. 4a, compared to the spiro-OMeTAD film with a water contact angle of 71.5°, the DRSBDT-2OT film showed a large water contact angle of 100.8° and retained a large contact angle of 85.0° after ten minutes. The obvious difference in the contact angles might be attributed to the smoother surface of the DRSBDT-2OT film with better hydrophobicity. The largely decreased contact angle of 32.2° for the spiro-OMeTAD film after 10 minutes indicates its poor water resistance as the water could easily penetrate the perovskite underneath the HTM layer and destroy the perovskite film. An interesting finding is that the mixed HTM-based film exhibits a large contact angle of 99.9° and a retained contact angle of 84.4° after 10 minutes, which is close to that of the pristine DRSBDT-2OT film (Fig. 4b), suggesting the dramatically improved hydrophobicity and water resistance for the mixed HTM by blending spiro-OMeTAD with DRSBDT-2OT. To investigate the long-term stability of the different HTM-based perovskite solar cells, unencapsulated devices were stored in ambient air with a relative humidity (RH) of 35 ± 5% in dark, and their photovoltaic performance was monitored over 750 hours. As shown in Fig. 4c, for the mixed HTM-based device, 84.1% of the initial average PCE was retained after 768 hours, which was close to that of the DRSBDT-2OT HTM-based devices, whereas the average PCE rapidly decreased to 56.3% of the initial value for the spiro-OMeTAD based devices. The enhanced stability can be attributed to the better hydrophobicity and superior water resistance of the mixed HTM, as discussed above, which could protect the perovskite film from moisture more efficiently than spiro-OMeTAD. Note that the slightly increased device efficiency in the first few hundred hours may be related to the improvement of the perovskite/HTL interface. The unencapsulated devices under continuous light soaking (white light-emitting diode, 100 mW cm−2) were further investigated in a glovebox filled with nitrogen. As shown in Fig. 4d, the average PCEs retained 82.7% and 81.0% of the initial value after 240 h for the DRSBDT-2OT and mixed HTM-based devices, respectively, whereas the spiro-OMeTAD-based device was reduced to 51.3% of the original performance, indicating the dramatically enhanced long-term stability of the mixed HTM-based devices. The improved stability of the mixed HTM-based devices compared to that of the spiro-OMeTAD based devices may be attributed to the passivation effects of DRSBDT-2OT in the mixed HTM, as discussed above.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have demonstrated a simple and facile way to improve the efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells by using mixed HTM. As an important component in the mixed HTM, the designed and as-synthesized small molecule DRSBDT-2OT exhibits high molecular planarity via noncovalent intramolecular S⋯O interactions, resulting in high hole mobility and low reorganization energy. The ESP results show that the strong electronegative atoms such as oxygen and nitrogen atoms in the carbonyl (CO) and cyano (CN) groups of DRSBDT-2OT concentrate the negative charges, which could passivate the perovskite trap state through coordination with the uncoordinated Pb2+. The mixed HTM with enhanced hole mobility and improved charge extraction ability could passivate the perovskite surface trap state and reduce the interface defect, resulting in a large Rrec and low Rct. The optimized device using mixed HTM exhibits a high PCE of 21.31%, which is much higher than that of the control device using spiro-OMeTAD HTM and the device using DRSBDT-2OT. Furthermore, the device stability was greatly improved due to the improved hydrophobicity and water-resistance of the mixed HTM, which could efficiently protect the perovskite film from moisture. These findings pave the way for the rational design of planar hole-transport materials for mixed HTMs toward highly efficient and stable perovskite solar cells.
