    , Accepted 26th November 2021First published on 27th November 2021AbstractIn the present study, electronic structure calculations were used to provide strategies for designing poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT)–fullerene-derivative-based donor–acceptor materials for use in high-efficiency bulk heterojunction organic solar cells (BHJ OSCs). The work systematically analyses the impact of electron-donating and -withdrawing substituents on the opto-electronic properties of the fullerene structures. Parameters relating to the absorption spectra, orbital distributions, and energy ordering of the frontier molecular orbitals (FMO), the interactions between P3HT and the fullerene derivatives, and charge transfer across the interface were investigated. We found that substitution with the electron-withdrawing group NO2 enhances the electronic coupling between the fullerene and P3HT; however, it reduces the open-circuit voltage (VOC) of the OSC through lowering the LUMO energy level. Furthermore, the results show that substitution with an electron-withdrawing group (NO2) and electron-donating group (OCH3) can improve the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the OSC, since this slightly improves the photon absorption abilities and charge transfer coupling at the interface without overly compromising VOC relative to PC61BM. Our study shows that alkyl chain modification in the PC61BM acceptor is a promising strategy for improving the performances of OSCs.
1. Introduction
Their low cost, light weight, and solution processability for large-scale fabrication make organic solar cells (OSCs) an advantageous photovoltaic technology.1,2 In particular, bulk heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells, which employ only organic materials as photoactive layer components, provide a non-toxic technology to harvest solar energy.3 The typical architecture of a BHJ polymer solar cell is as follows: a flexible transparent electrode, a photoactive layer, a counter electrode, and two buffer layers inserted between the photoactive layer and electrodes. Among all the components, the photoactive layer plays a pivotal role in harvesting solar light. A photoactive layer consists of a donor and acceptor blend, where the excitons are generated by photon absorption. The generated excitons diffuse to the donor–acceptor interface, and from there they dissociate into free electrons and holes; the dissociated charges are then passed to the respective electrodes.4 However, the power conversion efficiency of bulk heterojunction solar cells has not shown potential for the consideration of this technology for large-scale commercialization.4 Hence, the research focus is on improving the power conversion efficiency of BHJ OSCs by fine-tuning the active materials towards better photon absorption ability, charge carrier mobility, exciton diffusion, and charge separation at the interface. Such efforts have raised the efficiency record of BHJ OSCs to 18.22%.5
Two widely studied donor and acceptor materials in BHJ OSCs are poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and phenyl-C61/71-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM), respectively.6 The poor photon absorption abilities7,8 and low open-circuit voltages (VOC)9 of PC61/71BM fullerene materials represent critical drawbacks hampering their use as acceptors. However, fullerene-based acceptor materials still attract research interest due to their excellent electron transport ability10 and relatively good photostability.11 The high electron mobility in fullerene and its derivatives (approximately 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1)12,13 is due to its strong electron-deficient character and small reorganization energy (which is comparatively high among small molecule acceptor materials) for electron transfer.14 Therefore, in addition to being employed as acceptor materials in polymer solar cells, fullerene-based materials are also employed in electron-transport-layer-free perovskite solar cells.15–17 In order to improve the photon absorption ability, several derivatives of fullerene have been trialed; among them, PC61/71BM are well-studied derivatives. A study by Benatto et al.18 reported that among PC61BM and PC71BM, PC61BM annealed at 100 °C would be a better material due to its improved short circuit current (Jsc) because of its capability to form a better donor–acceptor (D–A) interface.
A potential strategy to improve the light absorption ability of C60-based fullerene derivatives is the introduction of asymmetry in the structure. The asymmetry of PC61BM can be increased by various strategies. One strategy is replacing or modifying the phenyl group (replacement groups include thiophene, furan, etc.); others include varying the alkyl chain length, modifying the terminal ester group (carboxylic acid, extended alkyl chains, etc.), and changing the fullerene cage, as in the cases of C70, C84, etc. Several studies have been done on the modification of fullerene to achieve a better PCE in OSCs.19–23 However, a systematic study that analyses the fine-tuning of the structural and electronic properties of the fullerene structure with electron-withdrawing and -donating substitutions is still absent.24 In the present study, we have performed density functional theory (DFT) and time dependent-density functional theory (TD-DFT) calculations on modified PC61BM molecules. The modifications were based on substitution with electron-withdrawing nitro groups25 and electron-donating methoxy groups,26 and alkyl chain length. Methoxy (–OCH3) and nitro (–NO2) groups were chosen based on their recognized role in fine-tuning the opto-electronic properties of organic semiconductors.27,28 The modifications were carried out carefully to analyze the impact of electron-donating (methoxy) and electron-withdrawing (nitro) functional groups on the opto-electronic properties of PC61BM. The present study investigates six structures, namely, PC61BM, C60, PC61DMB, C61(DMB)2, C61(DNB)2, and C61(DMBDNB)2. As shown in Fig. 1, C60 is a fullerene buckyball without any alkyl extension or functional groups, PC61BM is a widely used and more soluble derivative of C60 with one methoxy group, PC61DMB is a designed structure with two methoxy groups attached and alkyl chain extension, C61(DMB)2 is a modified structure with four methoxy groups attached and modified alkyl extension, C61(DNB)2 is analogous to C61(DMB)2 but with two nitro groups instead of methoxy groups, and the structure of C61(DMBDNB)2 comprises two methoxy and two nitro groups on either side. The impact of increasing the number of functional groups and changing the functional groups on the molecular geometry, absorption spectrum, frontier molecular orbitals, P3HT–fullerene interface, and charge transfer across the interface were analyzed. It should be noted that P3HT is a known donor molecule in OSCs.

2 Computational details
The geometry optimization of the studied isolated molecules and interacting D (P3HT)–A (fullerene) complexes was carried out at the B3LYP29,30/TZ2P31 level of theory, with BJ-damped D3-corrected dispersion.32 All the structural optimizations were carried out using dichlorobenzene as the solvent medium, since it is one of the widely used solvents in OSC,33–35 (ADF package).36 The basis set superposition error (BSSE)-corrected interaction energy between the donor and acceptor in D–A complexes was calculated at the D3-corrected37 B3LYP/TZ2P level of theory. The interaction energy for the D–A complex was calculated as follows: IE = TBE − (DBSSE + ABSSE)(1)where IE is the BSSE-corrected interaction energy of the D–A complex, TBE is the total bond energy of the D–A complex, DBSSE is the BSSE-corrected energy of the donor molecule and ABSSE is the BSSE-corrected energy of the acceptor molecule.
The effective charge transfer integral that quantifies the electronic coupling between adjacent molecules is calculated through the following formula:38 (2)where Ji,j is the charge transfer integral between the ith site and jth site (orbitals of adjacent molecules involved in charge transfer); Si,j is the spatial overlap integral between the corresponding orbitals, and εi and εj represent the site energy at the ith site and jth site, respectively. Note that Ji,j and the site energies are off-diagonal and diagonal matrix elements of the Kohn–Sham Hamiltonian matrix. The matrix of the Kohn–Sham Hamiltonian was computed at the PBE0/TZ2P level of theory using the fragment molecular orbital approach as implemented in the ADF package.39
The UV-Vis absorption spectrum of all the isolated structures and interacting complexes was calculated using TDDFT calculations at the CAM-B3LYP40/6-311G(d,p) level of theory in dichlorobenzene solvent using the Gaussian 09 package.41 CAM-B3LYP is a long-range corrected functional that performs well for excited-state calculations.42,43 After benchmarking, the frontier molecular orbital distribution pattern and energy of the donor, acceptor, and the D–A complexes were computed at the B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) level of theory. Furthermore, the electron density difference (EDD) analysis was carried out at the same level of theory.
3 Results and discussion
3.1 Frontier molecular orbitals
The orbital distribution and energy level alignment of the fullerene derivatives with P3HT are important factors for assessing their application in OSCs. A benchmark study was carried out with reference to the available experimental reports.44 The results of the benchmark study are presented in Table 1. It is observed that among the DFT exchange–correlation functionals LC-BLYP, CAM-B3LYP, B3LYP, and PBEPBE with the 6-311G(d,p) basis set, the results obtained from the B3LYP and PBEPBE functionals match the experimental results. In particular, the results obtained from B3LYP are more accurate in determining the HOMO energy of PC61BM and P3HT, while PBEPBE provides LUMO energy values closer to the experimental values. We chose B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) for further analysis of frontier molecular orbitals (FMO) considering its wider acceptability in electronic structure calculations.

The changes in FMO energy due to structural modifications are illustrated in Fig. 2; it is observed that the fullerene structures with methoxy group substitution showed a smaller HOMO–LUMO energy gap (Eg). As the number of methoxy groups increased, the HOMO–LUMO energy gap and the order of magnitude of Eg were PC61BM (2.53 eV) > PC61DMB (2.19 eV) and C61(DMB)2 (2.08 eV). The nitro-substituted case C61(DNB)2 had a higher energy gap compared to PC61BM, while for C61(DMBDNB)2, in which both nitro and methoxy groups are present, the Eg was relatively low. Another drawback noticed for C61(DNB)2 was that it had a down-shifted LUMO energy level, which may reduce the VOC of the device.

Scharber et al.45 showed that the open-circuit voltage of a BHJ OSC can be calculated from the expression , where e is the elementary charge and EL is the energy loss due to binding energy between the electron–hole pair and morphologically dependent factors such as phase separation between the donor and acceptor. Hence, we calculated the energy difference between the HOMO of the donor (EDONORHOMO) and the LUMO of the acceptor (EACCEPTORLUMO). As presented in Table 2, the highest energy difference is obtained for P3HT–PC61BM; that is, we can expect a better VOC for this donor–acceptor complex combination. Based on these results, we can expect a better VOC for P3HT–C61(DMB), P3HT–PC61DMB and P3HT–C61(DMBDNB)2 as well. It is observed that nitro group addition downshifts the LUMO of the fullerene acceptor, and thereby, it can reduce the VOC. As shown in Fig. 2, this can be further improved when the methoxy group is also added, as in the case of C61(DMBDNB)2.

The density distribution plots for the HOMO and LUMO are shown in Fig. 3. It is observed that in all the studied cases, the LUMO of the fullerene derivatives is delocalized over the fullerene cage. In the cases of C60, PC61BM, and C61(DNB)2, the HOMO is delocalized on the fullerene cage, and in the cases of PC61DMB and C61(DMB)2, the HOMO is delocalized on an auxiliary alkyl chain. In the case of C61(DMBDNB)2, the HOMO is partially delocalized on the fullerene cage and partially on the alkyl chain. That is, the presence of an additional methoxy group on the alkyl chain pulls the HOMO distribution to the alkyl chain. As shown in Fig. 3, the changes in the HOMO distribution in PC61DMB and C61(DMB)2 can influence their optical and charge transport properties and their interaction with the P3HT molecule.

3.2 Absorption spectra
The absorption spectra of the studied fullerene derivatives calculated at the CAM-B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) level of theory are shown in Fig. 4, and the relevant data are summarized in Table 3. The obtained results were compared with the available experimental findings.46,47 In the present study, the wavelength corresponding to the dominant electronic transition (λmax) was observed at 470 nm and 388 nm for P3HT and PC61BM, respectively, which are in reasonable agreement with the experimental λmax of 450 nm and 347 nm, respectively. Hence, the calculations of the absorption spectra of the modified structures were calculated at the same level of theory. As shown in Fig. 4, it is observed that the modifications carried out on PC61DMB, C61(DMB)2, and C61(DNB)2 are not conducive to enhancing the spectral behavior relative to PC61BM. However, C61(DMBDNB)2 shows a slight red shift in the absorption spectrum and improvement in molar absorption coefficient relative to those of PC61BM. That is, a combination of electron-donating and -withdrawing substitutions can improve the absorption spectrum of the fullerene cage.

3.3 Interacting complexes: structures and interaction energies
Previous studies have shown that the orientation of P3HT around the fullerene acceptor is one of the factors that influences the performance of OSCs.48 Proper orientation of the donor and acceptor molecules at the donor–acceptor interface will improve the overall performance of the OSC. Studies have shown that the face-on orientation, which allows maximum π-orbital overlap between the P3HT donor and fullerene acceptor at the interface, would provide the best photocurrent efficiency.6,35 Hence, in the present study the energy minimization for the fullerene–P3HT complexes was carried out for the face-on orientation (see Fig. 5). The BSSE-corrected interaction energy was calculated for the energy-minimized structures at the D3-corrected B3LYP/TZ2P level of theory. The calculated values are presented in Table 4. It is observed that all the complexes have strong interactions dominated by the π–π interaction. The calculated interaction energy of around −16 kcal mol−1 is much higher than the room-temperature thermal energy (0.58 kcal mol−1 at 300 K), which is in accordance with years of experimental observations showing a stable DA interface.49 The P3HT–C60 complex has the highest interaction energy of −18.2 kcal mol−1, probably due to strong π–π interaction and the absence of steric hindrance associated with the alkyl chain. The interaction energies of the nitro-group-containing complexes were higher than those of the methoxy-group containing complexes. Among the studied complexes, P3HT–C61(DMBDNB)2 showed the strongest interaction energy of −23.23 kcal mol−1, which is 7.53 kcal mol−1 higher than the interaction energy of P3HT–PC61BM.

3.4 Impact of the interactions between P3HT and the fullerene derivatives on the structures and orbital energies
It was found that the modifications of the fullerene molecule do not affect the molecular geometry of the fullerene cage. In the studied fullerene molecules, the CC bond length is 1.39 Å and C–C bond length is 1.45 Å. As shown in Fig. 5, there is a significant change in the dihedral angles of P3HT after the interaction. The dihedral angle of the P3HT molecule changes by 10° to 20° from 0° or 180° upon interaction with the fullerene cage, indicating that the P3HT molecule bends around the surface of the fullerene cage. The bending of P3HT is due to the strong π-orbital interaction between P3HT and the fullerene cage. The bending of P3HT around the surface of the fullerene cage changes the orbital energy of P3HT. As shown in Fig. 6, the energy of the HOMO is downshifted by 0.1 eV (from −4.8 eV for isolated P3HT), and the energy of LUMO is upshifted by 0.05 eV (from −2.31 eV for isolated P3HT). That is, the excitons created at the inner layer of P3HT must cross the barrier, corresponding to the change in orbital energy of the interacting P3HT.
 Fig. 6  A schematic representation of the formation and dissociation of Frenkel and charge-transfer (CT) excitons at the interface between P3HT and the fullerene layer. 
The FMO distributions of the energy-minimized P3HT–fullerene complexes were studied at the B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) level of theory. Fig. 5 depicts the density plots of the HOMO and LUMO for the energy-minimized complex structures. It is observed that in all the complexes the HOMO is delocalized throughout the donor P3HT, while the LUMO is delocalized over the acceptor fullerene cage. Such a distribution pattern at the interface is indicative of electron excitation from the HOMO to the LUMO, and the possibility for the formation of charge-transfer excitons (see Fig. 6).
3.6 Charge transfer integral and amount of charge transfer across the interface
The charge transfer rate in weakly coupled systems can be calculated using the Marcus rate equation,50. Here, ℏ is the reduced Planck's constant, KB is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the absolute temperature, which is also kept as a constant. Hence, the variables that control the charge transfer rate are Jeff, the effective charge transfer integral, and λ, the reorganization energy. In the case of fullerene molecules, the reorganization energy is negligible.51,52 The effective charge transfer integrals between the HOMO of P3HT and the HOMO of the fullerene derivatives (JHH) and the effective charge transfer integrals between the LUMO of P3HT and the LUMO of the fullerene derivatives (JLL) are summarized in Table 5. It is observed that for all the studied interfaces, the JHH is less than the JLL, which suggests that the electron mobility at the interface will be better than the hole mobility. On average, among the studied complexes, P3HT–C60 showed the highest charge transfer integrals for hole and electron transfer. The effective transfer integral for holes is relatively higher (0.01 eV) in the nitro-group-containing complex, P3HT–C61(DNB)2. The methoxy-group-substituted fullerene complexes showed the lowest charge transfer integrals for both hole and electron transport. On the other hand, the methoxy- and nitro-containing fullerene derivative P3HT–C61(DMBDNB)2 has the highest JLL of 0.044 eV. In order to quantitatively estimate the charge transfer across the interface, the amount of charge gained by the fullerene derivative after interaction with the P3HT molecule was analyzed through natural population analysis. It was observed that among the studied complexes, P3HT–C60 showed the highest amount of charge transfer (0.09 e). Again, the nitro-group-containing fullerenes gained more charge than the solely methoxy-substituted fullerenes, which is in accordance with the results obtained from the charge-transfer integral analysis.

3.7 Electron density difference
Electron density difference (EDD) plots provide pictorial information about the charge transfer occurring at the interface. The EDD plots of the studied complexes with a uniform isosurface value of 0.0002 a.u. are illustrated in Fig. 7. In these plots, the blue regions represent a negative charge (electron gain) and the red regions represent a positive charge (electron loss). It can be observed from Fig. 7 that the region of electron gain is delocalized in between the fullerene cage and P3HT molecule in all the complexes, and in all the cases the region of electron gain is closer to the fullerene cage. A small amount of the electron loss region is distributed over the fullerene cage, but it is predominantly distributed over the P3HT molecule. Comparing the plots, there is a thick blue region in the complexes P3HT–C60, P3HT–C61(DNB)2, and P3HT–C61(DMBDNB)2, but P3HT–C61(DMB)2 has the thinnest negative charge distribution. These observations are in agreement with the findings discussed in the previous section. That is, the electrostatic interaction between P3HT and C61(DMB)2 is relatively smaller, and the P3HT–C60 complex has stronger interaction that supports good charge transfer at the interface. However, C60 is not an ideal acceptor material due to its poor solubility and poor spectral absorption. The fullerene derivative with nitro and methoxy groups, C61(DMBDNB)2, is highly suitable with good interfacial charge transfer and desirable spectral behavior.

3.8 Photon excitation at the D–A interface (CT excitons)
As discussed in the previous section, the HOMO and LUMO of the interacting D–A complexes are segregated on the donor and acceptor moieties. Such distributions mediate photo-induced charge transfer from the donor moiety (on which the HOMO is delocalized) to the acceptor moiety (on which the LUMO is delocalized).53 Therefore, the absorption spectra of the interacting complexes were calculated at the CAM-B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) level of theory and are presented in Fig. 8 and in Table 6. From Fig. 8, it can be observed that P3HT–C61(DMB)2 shows the highest molar absorption coefficient, while P3HT–PC61BM and P3HT–C61(DNB)2 have comparable molar absorption coefficients, and the absorption maximum of P3HT–C61(DNB)2 is relatively blue-shifted. The molar absorption coefficient of P3HT–C61(DMBDNB)2 is slightly lower than that of the P3HT–PC61BM complex. It is noted that the wavelength corresponding to the spectral maxima of the complexes ranges between 500 nm and 600 nm, and that the dominant transition is associated with the electron transition from the HOMO to the LUMO, that is, the electron transfer from P3HT to the fullerene derivative. In comparison to the spectral distributions of P3HT and the isolated fullerene molecules, the spectral distribution of the P3HT–fullerene interface is red-shifted, which shows that the P3HT–fullerene interface can provide a complementary absorption. However, the molar absorption coefficient of the D–A complexes is still low and comparable to the molar absorption coefficients of the isolated fullerene derivatives, as listed in Table 6. While the CT states exhibit weak absorbance due to their small transition dipole moments, Frenkel excitons contribute the most.54,55 This implies that most of the photon absorption and exciton generation is chiefly through the P3HT donor,56 and that the modified fullerene acceptor and its complex with P3HT at the interface provided weak support, as reported in a previous study.57

4 Conclusions
Electronic structure calculations of the PC61BM molecule and its derivatives show that structural modifications on the alkyl chains of fullerenes have an impact on the opto-electronic properties of the fullerene. Among the studied derivatives, the dimethoxy- and dinitro-substituted derivative (C61(DMBDNB)2) showed a slight improvement in its absorption spectrum in terms of the molar absorption coefficient compared to the traditional acceptor PC61BM. Furthermore, the interactions of the fullerene derivatives with the donor P3HT were studied. It was found that the introduction of the electron-withdrawing group (NO2) to the fullerene derivatives improves the interaction with P3HT and also charge transport at the interface. However, substitution with NO2 downshifts the LUMO of the fullerene acceptor and can thereby reduce the open-circuit voltage. The studied opto-electronic properties show that the methoxy- and nitro-group-substituted fullerene derivative, C61(DMBDNB)2, showed good interfacial charge transport properties with a highest interaction energy of −23.26 kcal mol−1, a good charge transfer integral, and better charge-transport capabilities relative to the other studied PC61BM derivatives. Hence, C61(DMBDNB)2, which contains electron-withdrawing (NO2) and electron-donating (OCH3) groups is a potential acceptor material for high-performance and stable organic solar cells (OSCs).
