    , Accepted 6th July 2020First published on 5th August 2020AbstractSilicon, germanium and their alloys are classical semiconductors that play an important role in fundamental sciences and are the basis for modern microelectronics, optoelectronics, energy conversion, and other applications. The thermoelectric power (Seebeck coefficient) of p- and n-type materials in combination with the electrical and thermal conductivities characterizes the efficiency of thermal-to-electric energy conversion. In this work we experimentally show how one can effectively control the thermoelectric power of silicon-germanium alloys using an applied high pressure. We measured the Seebeck coefficient and the electrical resistance for several Si1−xGex crystals with different compositions under applied high pressure in (i) their original semiconductor cubic-diamond structure, (ii) across a phase transition to a metal phase at about 9–13 GPa, and (iii) across phase transformations to different metastable phases on pressure release. These studies were carried out for several pressurization and decompression cycles. The Si–Ge samples were examined by X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy. After the high-pressure cycling the Si–Ge samples transformed into two metastable phases, namely, a cubic bc8 phase (Si-III) with a p-type electrical conductivity in the Si-dominant samples, and a tetragonal st12 phase (Ge-III) in the Ge-dominant alloys, whose conductivity type depended on the Si content. The dramatic pressure-driven changes in the thermoelectric power of Si–Ge crystals we found suggest that these semiconductors are promising for use in various stress-controlled electronic junctions, such as switches, p–n diode elements, n–p–n (p–n–p) transistors, and multi-layer heterostructures with alternating types of electrical conductivity.
1. Introduction
Silicon, germanium and their alloys (Si–Ge) are prominent semiconductors that play an important role in fundamental sciences and have various industrial applications. Silicon–germanium alloys are promising for their use in fields such as bipolar technologies,1–3 photonic applications,4,5 and lithium-ion batteries,6–9 and in energy conversion technologies, in which, they serve as elements of either solar cells or thermoelectric devices.10–21 Hence, these materials are always the focus of further investigations. Using different methods, for example, high-pressure high-temperature synthesis routes, a number of novel polymorphs of Si and Ge can be fabricated, e.g., Si24 polymorph,22 Si10 polymorph,23,24 hexagonal phases of Ge and SiGe alloys with direct band gaps,25 and many other phases predicted to be stable.26–33
Because of low values of the thermal conductivity and significant values of the Seebeck coefficient at high temperatures bulk Si–Ge alloys are used in various thermoelectric modules for energy harvesting.11–21 The efficiency of such thermoelectric modules, figure of merit (ZT), directly depends on the thermoelectric power (Seebeck effect, S) as ZT = TS2σ/κ, where T is the temperature, σ is the electrical conductivity, and κ is the total thermal conductivity, consisting of lattice and electron contributions. The thermoelectric power, which shows a magnitude of thermoelectric voltage that can be generated in a sample under application of a temperature difference of 1 K, is very sensitive to changes in crystal and electronic band structures of this sample. Hence, a possibility to control the value and sign of the thermoelectric power of materials in general, and of Si–Ge alloys, in particular, would be highly important both for thermoelectric technologies themselves and for fabrication of various controls and switches (e.g., p–n switch of conductivity type) for novel nanoelectronic devices.
Like silicon and germanium, their alloys crystallize in a cubic-diamond structure (Fig. 1(a) and (b)),34–36 whose lattice parameter varies from 5.43 Å for silicon to 5.66 Å for germanium with an insignificant deviation from Vegard's law.34,37–39 Si1−xGex alloys (x > 0.85) have higher mobility values than silicon,40–42 and their electrical conductivity tends to increase with the Ge content.42 The fundamental energy gap of Si1−xGex depends on its composition but in different manners for Si- and Ge-dominant alloys (Fig. 1(c)). As can be seen in Fig. 1(c) the energy gap in the Si-dominant alloys moderately narrows with the Ge content; in contrast, in the Ge-dominant alloys the band gap more progressively widens with the Si content from 0.64 eV to about 0.85 eV for the Si0.15Ge0.85 composition (Fig. 1).2,43–47

(c) Composition dependence of the fundamental indirect energy gap of Si–Ge alloys replotted from the literature data for relaxed solid solutions (open circles connected by a solid curve, from ref. 43). The red arrows correspond to the compositions we investigated in this work. 
In Si–Ge alloys, which crystallize in the cubic-diamond-type structure with the only unique crystallographic site for atoms, the Si and Ge atoms can be randomly distributed over a crystal volume.48,49 However, in spite of Si/Ge being isovalent impurities for each other, because of the sizable difference in their atomic radii (Fig. 1(a) and (b)) these alloys may be characterized by different point defects depending on their chemical composition and preparation method. For minor Si/Ge substitutions one can expect a uniform chemical composition over a sample, whereas the higher levels of Si/Ge substitutions can lead to partial Si/Ge segregation and the formation of regions that are richer either in Si or in Ge.50,51 In some work it was noted that the smaller Si atoms are more prone to the formation of Si-rich clusters in the germanium lattice thereby causing both local distortions of the crystal structure and changes in the electron density configuration.52,53 Meanwhile, the larger Ge atoms are prone to entering the silicon lattice as separate atoms that leads to the appearance of internal compressive strains.54–59 To compensate these strains the Ge atoms interact with other point defects, and often vacancies are formed near the Ge atoms.60,61 One can surmise that an applied high pressure/stress could modify the native defect structure of Si–Ge alloys thereby changing their electronic and other properties.
Since semiconductor elements are the basis of modern electronics, both novel materials and alternative methods, which could effectively tune their optoelectronic properties, are always in much demand.62 Variation in the temperature can induce drastic changes in electronic transport properties (e.g., p–n switching), for example, in Ag10Te4Br3,63 AgBiSe2,64 AgCuS,65 Ag10Te4Br2.6Cl0.4,66 and in LaxSr2−xTiFeO6 perovskites.67 However, this approach can only be used to a limited extent in practical micro- or nanoelectronic devices. Other methods like controlled doping of a surface layer, implantation or irradiation and consequent annealing68 are not always applicable too. Meanwhile, methods based on strain engineering and tuneable applied stress, which are capable of changing the properties in micro- or nanoscale regions of semiconductors,69 seem more applicable to different optoelectronic devices, e.g., in switches, diodes, transistors, or memory elements. A number of academic studies of semiconductors reported the observation of remarkable pressure-induced structural or electronic transitions that are concurrent with drastic changes in their optoelectronic properties, including p–n inversions of the dominant conductivity type.70–75 These findings corroborated the high potential of this method.
In this work we investigated the effect of an applied high pressure on the thermoelectric power of silicon–germanium alloys with Si- and Ge-dominant compositions, Si1−xGex (x = 1, 0.98, 0.93, 0.87, 0.026, and 0), in the pressure range up to 17 GPa, that is, across a semiconductor–metal phase transition to a metal β-Sn-type phase at about 9–13 GPa.76–100 We found that the applied pressure can dramatically change the value of the Seebeck coefficient in the cubic-diamond structure of Si–Ge alloys, and for some compositions it can even invert the sign of the thermopower. High-pressure cycling across the semiconductor–metal phase transition point76–100 allowed stabilization of the metastable phases of Si1−xGex with different crystal structures and different electronic properties. The crystal structures of Si1−xGex alloys were examined by X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy. The findings of our work suggest that an applied pressure can directly affect the competition of different conductivity mechanisms in Si–Ge alloys. These results are of interest from both fundamental and applied perspectives. Based on the results of our work we proposed several potential innovative applications of Si–Ge alloys.
2. Experimental details
2.1. Synthesis of the Si–Ge samples
Bulk crystals of Si0.974Ge0.026 were grown by the Czochralski technique and characterized by conventional methods.101 These crystals had a p-type electrical conductivity and a low hole concentration of about 5 × 1015 cm−3.102 Bulk crystals of pure germanium with n- and p-type conductivities and low carrier concentrations of about 1014 cm−3 were provided by different suppliers. Large-grain polycrystalline Ge-dominant alloys, Si0.02Ge0.98, Si0.07Ge0.93, and Si0.13Ge0.87 were synthesized under high-pressure high-temperature conditions in a multi-anvil press.103 The synthesis procedures were the same as reported in previous studies.104–106 For the high-pressure electronic transport measurements we selected microscopic single-crystal grains of these Ge-dominant Si–Ge alloys with diameters exceeding ∼150 μm. The compositions of the samples were controlled by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) using a LEO-1530 instrument. For the exception of Si0.13Ge0.87, which exhibited minor fluctuations in the composition over the volume, the other samples were chemically uniform.
2.2. Characterization of the Si–Ge samples by Raman and X-ray diffraction studies
Both the as-grown and recovered samples after the high-pressure experiments were examined by Raman spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction. For the Raman studies we utilized a LabRam spectrometer and a He–Ne laser (λ = 632.8 nm).107,108 A spectral resolution of the setup amounted to about 0.5 cm−1. The structural examinations were carried out using high-brilliance Rigaku diffractometers with λ = 0.5594 Å (Ag Kα X-ray source) and 0.7108 Å (Mo Kα X-ray source). For one sample, namely, Si0.974Ge0.026, we performed in situ Raman spectroscopic experiments under applied high pressure to 40 GPa. These Raman studies were accomplished both for pressurization and decompression runs and allowed us to document the formation of metastable polymorphs upon pressure release. For this work we employed a diamond anvil cell of a piston-cylinder-type (BX90)109 equipped with a rhenium gasket. A hole in the rhenium gasket, in which the samples were placed, was filled with a neon pressure-transmitting medium using a BGI's gas loading apparatus.110 The neon medium provided a high-quality quasi-hydrostaticity around the sample up to the maximum pressure of 40 GPa.111 The pressure values were determined by the shift of the ruby luminescence line.
2.3. Characterization of the Si–Ge samples by electronic transport studies
Measurements of the thermoelectric power (Seebeck coefficient) and electrical resistance under applied high pressure were carried out in two different anvil-type high-pressure cells. One cell was of a toroidal type; its anvils had a working diameter of ∼1 mm and were characterized by semispherical cavities in the centre. This cell allowed measurements of bulk ‘3D’ samples with typical sizes of about 150 × 150 × 150 μm3 under high pressure up to 9 GPa (Fig. 2(a)).112 Another cell was of a modified Bridgman type, and was equipped with sintered-diamond anvils having flat working surfaces of 600 μm in diameter.113,114 In this cell we could measure thin ‘2D’ samples with typical sizes of about 200 × 200 × 30 μm3 in the higher pressure range up to 20 GPa.112 The high-pressure cell with semispherical cavities in the anvils provided a quasi-hydrostatic compression regime for a sample.115,116 In another cell, which was equipped with conventional flat anvils, the ratio of the sample thickness (30 μm) to the culet size of the anvils (600 μm) amounted to about 0.05. This value is less than the threshold value of 0.055–0.057, which was found earlier to correspond to the suppression of uniaxial pressure components in solid media.117 In both cells a sample was loaded into a hole drilled in the centre of a toroidal-shaped container made of limestone mineral (predominantly CaCO3).114,118 This sample container also served as a gasket and as a pressure-transmitting medium. Limestone has a low yield strength shear, and hence, it is a suitable material for pressure-transmitting medium,119 which may be comparable with NaCl powder.120 The main component of the limestone (calcite) is known to undergo pressure-driven phase transitions at about 1.5–2 GPa, concurrent with notable volumetric effects.121 This circumstance also contributed to the improvement of quasi-hydrostaticity of the pressure around a sample. Thus, both high-pressure cells equipped with the limestone sample container could provide a quasi-hydrostatic compression regime.

The high-pressure cells were loaded into an automated mini-press setup, which smoothly generated a force applied to a cell with assistance of electric motors, and automatically recorded all relevant parameters.122 The measurements were performed both for pressurization and decompression runs for multiple pressure cycles. The values of the force applied to a cell were automatically measured using a digital dynamometer, and then, they were converted into pressure values.112 Typical times of pressurization or decompression cycles amounted to 15–20 minutes. Electrical resistance values were measured by a quasi-four-probe method (two bifurcated probes).72,123,124 For the thermoelectric power measurements an upper anvil was electrically heated to generate a temperature difference (ΔT) of several Kelvins between the upper and lower sides of the sample (Fig. 2(a)).125 This ΔT difference generated a thermoelectric voltage (Fig. 2(b)), and it was measured using thermocouples attached near the anvil tips (Fig. 2(a)).126
3. Results
The Raman spectra of the Si–Ge alloys are depicted in Fig. 3. The main LO phonon mode of germanium in the Ge-dominant samples only slightly softens with the Si content. For the maximal Si content of 13 at% the difference in the wavenumbers with pure Ge amounted to only about 2 cm−1 (Fig. 3(a)). This observation was in line with previous Raman studies on Si1−xGex.40,127–138 The other very weak peaks we documented in the spectra of the Ge-dominant samples at 354, 385, and 403 cm−1 (Fig. 3(b)) are not observed in the spectra of pure germanium, and hence, they could originate from some Si–Ge-related vibrations. Previous Raman examinations of Si–Ge alloys with intermediate compositions also found a peak linked to Si–Ge vibrations about 400 cm−1 and noted its sensitivity to many factors, such as composition, sample morphology and crystallinity.40,134–142 Compared to pure silicon, in the Si0.974Ge0.026 composition a wavenumber of the strongest LO phonon softens a bit to 519 cm−1. Very weak and broad peaks in the spectra of Si0.974Ge0.026 at 375 and 399 cm−1 (inset in Fig. 3(b)) have a correspondence with the above weak peaks in the Ge-dominant samples. The peaks at 301 and 430 cm−1 we observed in Si0.974Ge0.026 were also reported for pure silicon, and they were assigned in the literature to the transverse acoustical phonon modes, 2TA(X) and 2TA(Σ), respectively.79,137,139,143–147

We investigated the high-pressure behaviour of the Seebeck coefficient of the Si–Ge alloys in two different high-pressure cells. One cell could generate high pressures up to 9 GPa that corresponded to a stability region of the original cubic-diamond phase (Si-I, Ge-I) (Fig. 4). The other cell could generate high pressures somewhat above the semiconductor–metal phase transition point about 9–13 GPa,76–96 and allowed measurements of the Seebeck coefficient of both metal phases with a β-Sn-type structure (Si-II, Ge-II) and the metastable phases that appear upon pressure release (Fig. 4).78,84,86,95,147–164 Below, we report the results of our studies of the high-pressure behaviour of the thermoelectric power and electrical resistance of the Ge-dominant Si–Ge alloys (Fig. 5–8) and of Si0.974Ge0.026 (Fig. 9 and 10). We supplement these results by high-pressure Raman spectroscopic data for Si0.974Ge0.026 (Fig. 11 and 12) that documented the phase transitions in pressurization and decompression cycles.
 Fig. 4  Selected crystal structures of silicon and germanium. (a) Under ambient conditions both silicon and germanium crystallize in the cubic-diamond-type structure with the Fdm space group, #227 (known as Si-I and Ge-I). (b) Under applied high pressure above 9–13 GPa this diamond-type structure transforms into a metal β-Sn-type structure with the I41/amd space group, #141 (known as Si-II and Ge-II). (c) On decompression the β-Sn-type structure of Ge usually transforms into a metastable st12 structure with the P43212 space group, #96 (known as Ge-III), which can be quenched under ambient conditions. (d) On decompression the β-Sn-type structure of Si firstly transforms into a metastable r8 structure with the R space group, #148 (known as Si-XII), and (e) then, on pressure release, transforms into a metastable bc8 structure with the Ia space group, #206 (known as Si-III). Rarely, depending on stress conditions, after pressure release Ge can also adopt the same structure as Si-III (e) (known as Ge-IV).

The thin arrows indicate the directions of pressure variation. After the first decompression cycle, the metastable Ge-III-type phase was formed. Hence, the second and following pressure cycles should correspond to the Ge-III → Ge-II phase transition. The bulk arrows indicate anomalies, which should be linked to the phase transitions. The insets in (c) and (d) show the magnified parts of the thermopower curves, which demonstrate these anomalies more distinctly.

3.1. Ge-Dominant Si–Ge alloys: high-pressure effect on the thermoelectric power in the cubic-diamond phase
The pressure dependencies of the thermoelectric power of the Ge-dominant Si–Ge samples for several pressure cycles are shown in Fig. 5. Under normal conditions only pure Ge was characterized by a negative Seebeck coefficient of −330 μV K−1 (Fig. 5(a)). This fact suggested a dominant n-type electrical conductivity. The germanium substitution with Si (Si0.02Ge0.98, Si0.07Ge0.93, and Si0.13Ge0.87 samples) led to the stabilization of the p-type electrical conductivity under normal conditions (Fig. 5(b and c)). This charge-carrier inversion could result from the appearance of intrinsic point defects in the cubic-diamond crystal structure of Ge.165,166 An increase in the Si content led to a decrease in the Seebeck coefficient, from about +465 μV K−1 for x = 0.02 to about +200 μV K−1 for x = 0.13 (Fig. 5). At the initial compression of 1 GPa the sample of pure Ge irreversibly inverted the electrical conductivity type, and on the successive pressure cycles it behaved already as a p-type semiconductor (Fig. 5(a)). An n–p inversion of the electrical conductivity type in pure Ge samples was already documented in our previous work.73 This effect was attributed to a splitting of the ‘heavy’ and ‘light’ holes bands followed by a carrier transfer to the ‘light’ one, in which the holes are much more mobile.73 Thus, the present results confirm these previous findings.
The entire pressure dependencies of the thermopower plotted in Fig. 5 corresponded to the stability range of the original cubic-diamond-type phase. All the samples demonstrated the apparent kinks in the curves about 2–5 GPa for both pressurization and decompression cycles (Fig. 5). These features likely result from some reversible reconstruction in their electronic band structures. Remarkably, the samples with different Seebeck coefficients, ranging from −330 μV K−1 to +465 μV K−1 at normal pressure, demonstrated rather a similar pressure behaviour of the thermopower above 1 GPa. For example, the thermopower curves for n-type Ge and p-type Si0.07Ge0.93 almost coincided above 1 GPa (Fig. 6(a)). These findings strongly suggested that all the samples were characterized by an intrinsic semiconductor conductivity, and the pressure behaviour of their Seebeck coefficients was tightly linked to the Ge-like band structures of these alloys.2,43–46 Thus, we can conclude that the slightly compressed samples of pure and Si-substituted germanium are always p-type conductors irrespective of the conductivity type and crystallinity of the original samples. A moderate compression above 5–6 GPa strongly suppressed the thermoelectric power of these Ge-dominant alloys (Fig. 6). Since the value of the indirect band gap of germanium was found to widen insignificantly with pressure,167–169 the suppression of the Seebeck coefficient was likely caused by an enhancement of n-type contribution that led to a nearly compensated electronic state (i.e., with nearly equal partial conductivities of electrons and holes) (Fig. 6). Starting from the second pressure cycle, the pressure-driven changes in the thermopower curves of these samples were reversible (Fig. 5). The bends in the thermopower curves about 2–5 GPa shifted a bit to higher pressures with the cycle number likely because of a minor deterioration of the samples (Fig. 5). After these high-pressure-cycling experiments all the recovered samples were characterized by nearly identical magnitudes of their Seebeck coefficients of about +(170–200) μV K−1 (Fig. 5).
3.2. Ge-Dominant Si–Ge alloys: variation in the thermoelectric power across the phase transitions under pressure
The pressure dependencies of the thermoelectric power of the p-type Ge-rich Si–Ge alloys measured across the phase transition to the metal β-Sn structure (Ge-II) are shown in Fig. 7. In the pressure range from 1 to 8 GPa these thermopower curves for the first pressurization cycle were quite similar to those measured in the toroidal high-pressure cell are and shown in (Fig. 5(b–d)). On the first pressurization cycle all the samples conserved the original p-type electrical conductivity (Fig. 7). In the vicinity of the semiconductor–metal phase transition about 9–13 GPa,76,77,83–92 the thermopower curves exhibited a distinct turning point (insets in Fig. 7(c) and (d)). Above the phase transition point in the β-Sn-type structure the Seebeck coefficients of these samples slightly increased with pressure.
Interestingly, on the first decompression cycle from the metal β-Sn phase the thermopower curves for these samples demonstrated very different dependencies. Thus, for pure and slightly-substituted samples (Ge and Si0.02Ge0.98) we observed an abrupt change in the Seebeck coefficients at 2–3 GPa to high negative values of about −(250–300) μV K−1 (Fig. 7(a) and (b)). This behaviour suggested the formation of a phase with dominant n-type conductivity. The other two samples, namely, Si0.07Ge0.93 and Si0.13Ge0.87, showed an opposite tendency, and below 2 GPa their Seebeck coefficients jumped to high positive values of about +(150 ÷ 170) μV K−1 (Fig. 7(c) and (d)). On the re-pressurization cycles, Ge and Si0.02Ge0.98 demonstrated a similar behaviour. Their thermopower curves showed very smooth bends about 5 GPa and an apparent phase transition to the metal β-Sn phase at about 9 GPa, i.e., at nearly the same pressure as the transition detected on the first cycle. Furthermore, this phase transition was accompanied by a reversible n–p inversion (Fig. 7(a) and (b)). In contrast, the Seebeck coefficient of the Si0.07Ge0.93 sample showed a dependence on the cycle number and demonstrated the alternating type of the dominant electrical conductivity (Fig. 7(c)). In sample with the highest Si content (Si0.13Ge0.87) the p-type conductivity was conserved in the whole pressure range for all pressure cycles. Note here that the above discussed pressure cycling up to 8 GPa (Fig. 5), i.e., below the phase transition point,76,77,83–92 did not result in such dramatic variations in the Seebeck coefficients. Therefore, these changes should be linked to the formation of the metastable phases on the decompression pathway from the metal β-Sn phase.84,85,92,150–156,162,163 Two metastable phases of germanium, which can be formed after different high-pressure treatments, were reported in the literature. One of them has a tetragonal st12 structure (Ge-III) (Fig. 4(c)) and is often formed after slow decompression runs.84,85,163,164 The other metastable phase adopts a cubic bc8 structure (Ge-IV) and may be quenched to ambient conditions during very fast decompression cycles (less than 1 second).154
To clarify the origin of the thermopower variations observed on the decompression cycles (Fig. 7) we examined the samples recovered under ambient conditions after these experiments (Fig. 8(a)) by Raman spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction (Fig. 8(c) and (b), (d)). Because of a notch filter the Raman spectra below 200 cm−1 were cut, and we could detect only three peaks at 226, 242 and 270 cm−1 in all the samples (Fig. 8(c)). We noted that with the Si content the wavenumbers of these phonons slightly shifted to higher frequencies. In the literature these phonon modes were assigned to the metastable tetragonal st12 structure (Ge-III).73,155,156,170–176 A certain broadening in these spectra may be attributed to a minor disorder in the crystal structure owing to the pressure cycling over the phase transition region.177 In the X-ray diffraction studies this conjecture has been confirmed for all the Ge dominant samples (Fig. 8(b) and (d)). Although, a quality of these structural data was rather limited we could perform a full-profile analysis of these patterns and confirmed that they all can be fit well by the P43212 tetragonal space group (#96) of the Ge-III phase. An example of these fits for pure Ge is given in Fig. 8(d). For pure Ge we found the unit cell parameters and the atomic coordinates to be as follows: a = 5.933(7) Å, c = 6.966(0) Å, V = 245.26(7) Å3, Z = 12, Ge1(0.0934, 0.0934, 0), and Ge2(0.1696, 0.3439, 0.2579) (Fig. 4(c)). These structural data were similar to those reported previously in the literature.158
The significant values of the Seebeck coefficients of about −(250–300) μV K−1 in the metastable tetragonal st12 phase (Ge-III) of Ge and Ge-rich samples (Fig. 7) pointed out their semiconducting character. A band gap value in this Ge-III phase may be comparable with a gap of 0.67 eV in the cubic-diamond structure of Ge.73 This finding agreed well with a recent experimental determination of an indirect band gap of 0.59 eV in the pure Ge-III phase164 as well as with an earlier predicted band-gap value of ∼0.7 eV.152 Our thermopower data indicated that a native defect structure in the Ge-III phase of pure and slightly substituted samples corresponds to the n-type electrical conductivity (Fig. 7(a) and (b)). The higher silicon content strongly shifted the conductivity in the Ge-III phase to p-type (Fig. 7(c) and (d)). For Si0.13Ge0.87 this led to the stabilization of the p-type conductivity in all the phases. For the intermediate composition, Si0.07Ge0.93, the thermopower fluctuations on the decompression cycles pointed out a strong competition between the n- and p-type partial conductivities (Fig. 7(c)). Under high pressure this metastable Ge-III phase should also transform into the thermodynamically stable metal β-Sn-type phase, but the transition pressure remains a point of issue. On the one hand, the transition pressure can correspond to the region of the thermodynamic stability of the β-Sn phase, i.e., it may be the same as in the cubic-diamond-type Ge.76,77,83–92 But on the other hand, since this metastable phase is already strongly ‘pre-compressed’ by about 10–12%, compared to the cubic-diamond one,84,85,148,174 less applied pressure is needed to increase the density of the materials to a critical level to cause this transition. Our results demonstrated that the Ge-III → Ge-II phase transition occurs rather abruptly and its transition pressure tends to decrease with the Si content (Fig. 8(e) and (f)). These findings hint that even the metal phase of the Si–Ge alloys could be stabilized in thin strained films. Thus, our work showed that the thermoelectric power of the Si–Ge alloys may be dramatically changed by using an applied high pressure. These thermopower changes are linked not only to the structural phase transitions but to different electronic states, which may be varied by using an applied pressure.
3.3. Si-Dominant Si–Ge alloys: high-pressure effect on the thermoelectric power in the cubic-diamond phase
The silicon-rich Si1−xGex crystal (Si0.974Ge0.026) had a p-type electrical conductivity and showed a high value of the Seebeck coefficient above 1 mV K−1 (Fig. 9(a)). We carried out the measurements using high-pressure cells equipped with pressed electrical probes, and for this reason we could not measure the thermopower without applied pressure, i.e., under ambient conditions. We observed that application of even a minor pressure of less than 1 GPa can spectacularly change the electronic transport properties of this crystal (Fig. 9). An electrical conductivity of Si0.974Ge0.026 was strongly enhanced to 1 GPa by about three orders of magnitude (the inset in Fig. 9(a)), and the dominant conductivity type was changed from p- to n- (Fig. 9). Pure silicon did not exhibit such effects on the electrical resistance178 and the thermopower.179 We found that the pressure-driven drop in the electrical resistance value is reversible and reproducible for the successive pressure cycles (inset in Fig. 9(a)). Meanwhile, the p–n inversion at 0.5–1 GPa may be reversible only if the maximal applied pressure does not exceed approximately 1 GPa. For instance, we compressed one Si0.974Ge0.026 crystal to 0.75 GPa, and then slightly released the force of the press. This led to relaxation changes in both the pressure value in the high-pressure cell and the electronic properties of the sample. Thus, for 40 minutes the pressure in the cell gradually decreased to 0.45 GPa. This caused a return n–p inversion about 0.55 GPa (insets in Fig. 9(b)). However, if the applied pressure well exceeds 1 GPa (this approximately corresponds to the negative extremum on the curves) the original p-type conductivity can no longer be easily restored upon decompression. The p–n inversion in Si0.974Ge0.026 is likely linked to a modification of its native defect structure, and hence, the return n–p inversion could be probably stimulated by sample annealing. In one sample of Si0.974Ge0.026 cut from the same crystal we observed even more spectacular effects consisting of a triple p–n–p–n sign inversion upon compression to 1.5 GPa (Fig. 9(a)). These anomalies were likely linked to minor pressure gradients in the high-pressure cell that could spontaneously appear in the solid pressure-transmitting medium across the sample. A stronger compression of Si0.974Ge0.026 crystals resulted in an electronic transition to a compensated state that was characterized by nearly equivalent partial conductivities of holes and electrons and close to zero thermopower values (Fig. 9). This compensated state was rather robust and preserved on pressure release. In this case, a resulting value of the Seebeck coefficient was very small and could be either positive or negative (Fig. 9). Generally, the effects we found suggest that Si1−xGex crystals with a low Ge content are highly promising for different piezoelectric and optoelectronic technologies.
3.4. Si-Dominant Si–Ge alloys: variations in the thermoelectric power across the phase transitions under pressure
One sample of Si0.974Ge0.026 (#3) cut from the same bulk single-crystalline ingot was subjected to pressure cycling up to 17 GPa across the semiconductor–metal phase transition (Fig. 10(a)). This sample #3 also exhibited a p–n inversion after the start of the compression, but its thermopower variations looked more smeared, compared to those observed in samples #1 and #2 (Fig. 9). This difference can be explained by the fact that the measurements of samples #1 and #2 were conducted in the toroidal high-pressure cell that provided better quasi-hydrostaticity, compared to the higher-pressure cell with flat anvils, which was utilized for the measurements of sample #3. Similar to samples #1 and #2, sample #3 also changed into a strongly compensated electronic state above a few GPa (Fig. 10(a)). A gentle bend on the thermopower curves for all pressurization cycles in the vicinity of 11 GPa (Fig. 10(b)) can be attributed to the phase transition to the metallic β-Sn phase (Si-II).76–80,86–88,93–96,155–157 On the decompression cycles we found a steeping dip on the curves about 4 GPa and a reverse jump at 0.6 GPa (Fig. 10(b)). These features could be linked to the formation of the metastable phases, namely, the rhombohedral phase, r8 (Si-XII) and the body-centred cubic phase, bc8 (Si-III) (Fig. 4), although, the higher transition pressures for these phases were previously reported.88,158,159 Note here that the difference in the decompression pathways for Si and Ge was explained in the literature by the fact that the kinetic barriers for the different phase transitions in Si and Ge are not the same, and upon decompression from the β-Sn phase each of these elements follows the kinetically simplest pathway instead of a return transformation to the more energetically-favourable cubic-diamond structure.162
To verify that sample #3 of Si0.974Ge0.026 recovered after the pressure-cycling experiments up to 17 GPa (Fig. 10(a) and (b)) indeed transformed into the metastable Si-III-type phase we examined it by Raman spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction (Fig. 10(c) and (d)). A Raman spectrum of this sample looked nearly identical to those reported in the literature for pure Si in the Si-III phase155–157,160,161,180–182 except the low-frequency region. In particular, we did not observe a reported earlier peak at 182 cm−1 likely because of a significant suppression of this region using a notch filter. At the same time, we observed a new peak at 294 cm−1 (Fig. 10(c)), which was absent in the spectra of pure Si.155–157,160,161,180–182 Note here that in the in-situ high-pressure Raman spectroscopic studies of this sample that are discussed below a similar peak was also observed (Fig. 11(c)). The X-ray diffraction studies of this sample confirmed the Ia space group (#206) and found the unit-cell parameters as a = 6.623(4) Å, V = 290.56(3) Å3, and Z = 16 (Fig. 4(e)). These results agreed well with the data of a recent high-quality study on Si-III polymorphs.183
Thus, we can conclude that both the rhombohedral phase, r8 (Si-XII), and the body-centred cubic phase, bc8 (Si-III), are p-type conductors with a nearly semimetal conductivity (Fig. 10(b)). A phase transition from these metastable phases to the metallic β-Sn structure (Si-II) was not accompanied by any dramatic changes in the transport properties, as seen from the thermopower and the electrical resistance data (inset in Fig. 10(a)). These findings are in line with the thermopower data for pure Si.179 A previous study also reported for the Si-III phase a p-type semimetal conductivity with a hole concentration of 5 × 1020 cm−3.149 Following investigations reported a semiconducting-like dependence of the electrical resistivity at normal pressure for the Si-III phase.183 More recent work discovered an ultra-narrow direct band gap of 30 meV in this phase.184
3.5. Si-Dominant Si–Ge alloys: Raman spectroscopy under high pressure
To examine the crystal structure stability of the Si–Ge samples we carried out a Raman spectroscopic study on the sample of Si0.974Ge0.026 (Fig. 11 and 12). We found that the semiconductor–metal phase transition in Si0.974Ge0.026 occurs between 13 and 16 GPa (Fig. 11(b)), i.e., at somewhat higher pressures than in pure bulk Si.76–80,86–88,93–96,155–157 This finding was in line with previous Raman studies of Ge-substituted silicon.96 Tentatively, this increased transition pressure can be explained by a minor lattice expansion due to the incorporation of bigger Ge atoms (Fig. 1(b)).7,34,185–187 In visual examinations through a diamond window we observed the appearance of a distinct metallic lustre in the sample at a pressure of 16 GPa (Fig. 11(a)). In the metal phase of Si0.974Ge0.026 we found a doublet at 385 and 405 cm−1 in a spectrum collected at 16 GPa and a single peak at 413 cm−1 in a spectrum collected at 16.9 GPa (inset in Fig. 11(b)). At higher pressures up to 39 GPa no clear Raman peaks were detected. These results generally agreed with previous studies for Si.87 This work also reported the appearance of a few phonon modes with similar wavenumbers in the β-Sn-type phase of silicon (Si-II) and the loss of the Raman spectra above 16 GPa.87
On a decompression cycle we observed the formation of the metastable high-pressure phases (Fig. 11(c)). The Raman spectra of these phases were similar to those reported previously,155–157,160,161,180–182 and should correspond to the rhombohedral phase, r8 (Si-XII), and the body-centred cubic phase, bc8 (Si-III), (Fig. 4(d) and (e)).78,159–161 The discontinuities in the pressure evolution of some wavenumbers of these spectra suggested a phase transition between them about 3 GPa (the inset in Fig. 12(c)), in agreement with previous studies for Si.155–159 A spectrum we collected after the complete pressure release (Fig. 11(c)) was nearly identical to the one we obtained in the sample recovered from the electronic-transport studies up to 17 GPa (Fig. 10(c)). This also agreed with the spectra of Si-III polymorphs reported in the literature.155–157,160,161,180–182 These in situ Raman studies also detected a peak at 288 cm−1 (at normal pressure) and followed its pressure evolution on the decompression cycle (Fig. 11(c)). Recall here that we observed a similar peak at 294 cm−1 in the sample recovered after the electronic-transport experiments up to 17 GPa (Fig. 10(c)). Thus, the repeat observation of this peak at a bit different wavenumber in another sample of Si0.974Ge0.026 suggested that this is an intrinsic feature, which could be a local mode related to the presence of the Ge atoms in the Si-III structure.
Pressure dependencies of the wavenumbers of Si0.974Ge0.026 for pressurization and decompression cycles for Si-I, Si-II, Si-XII, and Si-III phases are given in Fig. 12. The main LO phonon of the cubic-diamond Si-I phase shifted to higher frequencies with pressure (Fig. 12(a)). This behaviour reflected a tightening of the chemical bond in Si-I upon compression and generally agreed well with previous studies.79,134,150,157,188 However, in contrast to previous studies for pure Si we found a bend at 2 GPa in the pressure dependence of this LO phonon in Si0.974Ge0.026 (Fig. 12(a)). This peculiarity had a correspondence with the electronic transition to the compensated state we observed in Si0.974Ge0.026 about 2 GPa (Fig. 9). Another peak at 430 cm−1, which was assigned to the 2TA(Σ) silicon mode,146 showed a similar behaviour with a kink at about 2 GPa (Fig. 12(b)). Meanwhile, a peak at 300 cm−1, which was assigned to the 2TA(X) silicon mode,146 demonstrated, in contrast, a gradual softening with pressure (Fig. 12(c)). Thus, our Raman studies of Si0.974Ge0.026 established a correspondence between the changes in the electronic transport properties (Fig. 9) on the one hand, and the changes in the vibrational properties (Fig. 11 and 12), which are linked to the local order, on the other hand.
4. Discussion
4.1. High-pressure effect on the thermopower of the Si–Ge alloys
The thermoelectric power of intrinsic semiconductors with two-band electrical conductivity depends directly on the band gap value (Eg) and competition between partial conductivities of electrons (σn) and holes (σp) as follows:189 (1)where e is the electron charge, k is Boltzmann's constant, T is the temperature, rn(rp) and  are the scattering parameters and the effective masses of density of states of electrons (holes), respectively.
It was established that the fundamental indirect band gap of silicon moderately narrows with pressure,80,168,190 whereas the fundamental gaps of Ge and Ge-dominant alloys, SixGe1−x (x < 0.2), in contrast, insignificantly increase with pressure in their cubic-diamond phases.168,169,191 The direct band gaps of all the Si–Ge semiconductors were found to widen with pressure.192–196 Thus, the dramatic pressure-driven changes in the thermopower of the Si–Ge samples we observed (Fig. 5, 6, and 9) could not be explained by these pressure dependencies of the band gaps. Hence, in accordance with eqn (1), they should be linked to some intricate changes in the electronic band structure parameters, which led to variations in the ratio of the partial conductivities of electrons and holes (σn/σp). Under normal conditions the Seebeck coefficient of the Ge-dominant alloys was found to decrease with the Si content (Fig. 5), whereas the fundamental band gap should widen with the Si content (Fig. 1(c)), thereby suggesting the opposite trend for the thermopower (eqn (1)). Rough estimations for these Ge-dominant alloys by using eqn (1) with the band-gap values estimated from Fig. 1(c), k/|e| ≈ 86.4 μV K−1, and 2kT ≈ 50 meV (at 300 K), gave the partial conductivities ratios as σn/σp = 0.56 for Si0.02Ge0.98 with S ≈ +330 μV K−1, σn/σp = 0.65 for Si0.07Ge0.93 with S ≈ +272 μV K−1, and σn/σp = 0.77 for Si0.13Ge0.87 with S ≈ +182.7 μV K−1 (Fig. 7). In the case of pure germanium the n–p inversion under compression (Fig. 5(a)) was attributed to splitting of overlapping bands of “light” and “heavy” holes on the top of the valence band followed by a carrier transfer to the ‘light’ one, in which the holes are much more mobile.73
Since the atomic radii of Si and Ge are notably different (110 vs. 125 pm) (Fig. 1(a) and (b)), fabrication of their ideal solid solutions seems to be not an easy task.197–200 In real Si–Ge materials, even in single crystals, a distribution of Si and Ge atoms may not be truly uniform, and a slight tendency to Si/Ge segregation can occur. For example, synchrotron topographic studies of bulk Si–Ge crystals with a low Ge content (1.4–2.6 at%) observed weak but numerous Ge striations and showed that high-temperature annealing can make these crystals more uniform.37,199 Minor negative deviations of the lattice parameter a of the Si–Ge alloys with cubic-diamond structures from the linear Vegard's law were noted both in epitaxial films201 and in single crystals.37 These findings together with others suggest the presence of local strains in Si–Ge materials, which are linked to variations in both bond lengths and bond angles between Si(Ge) atoms.202 These strains can affect the properties of the Si–Ge alloys. For example, as found in Raman spectroscopic studies, the phonon modes of the Si–Ge alloys with nominally the same chemical compositions can have different wavenumbers because of the contribution of these spontaneous local strains.203,204
Thus, for the Si–Ge alloys with intrinsic semiconductor conductivity and low values of carrier concentrations, the pressure-driven changes in their electronic transport properties should depend not only on variations in their electronic band structures but also on modifications in their native defect structures. For example, the abrupt pressure-induced p–n inversion in the conductivity type of the Si0.974Ge0.026 crystals (Fig. 9) should be linked to the applied-pressure effect on the defect complexes. Germanium atoms are larger than the silicon ones (Fig. 1(a) and (b)), and they could be effective traps for vacancies.102,205–208 The enthalpy of electron ionization in such Ge-vacancy-related complexes in Si rich Si1–xGex crystals was established to increase strongly with the increase in the average Si–Si distance in the cubic-diamond crystal structure.102,205 From this result it follows that under applied pressure that leads to contraction in the average Si–Si distance, the enthalpy of electron ionization is expected to reduce progressively, and hence, n-type partial conductivity can be enhanced. The pressure dependencies of the Seebeck coefficient of the Si0.974Ge0.026 crystals up to about 1 GPa (Fig. 9) were in line with this conjecture. In addition, the thermopower curves demonstrated that above some threshold pressure of about 1 GPa this p–n switching becomes irreversible, which can be interpreted as an irreversible modification of the defect structure under the applied pressure. The thermopower data also disclosed the existence of the second threshold pressure of about 2–4 GPa, which corresponded to a gradual and irreversible transition of Si0.974Ge0.026 crystals to the strongly compensated electronic state (i.e., with σn ≈ σp) (Fig. 9). Likely, this transition was caused by another irreversible modification of the defect structure, for example, by filling the vacancies and subsequent annihilation of their-related complexes. Note that because of the very low semiconductor-like concentrations of these defects their detailed characterization by other methods like transmission electron microscopy is hardly possible.
The stabilization of the p-type conductivity in the Ge-dominant Si–Ge samples (Fig. 5) may also be linked to the occurrence of intrinsic point defects.165,166 It was found that the formation of significant number of holes is inevitable for the SiGe layer with high Ge concentration, even if dopants are carefully excluded.165 For a set of Si1–xGex (0.19 < x < 0.77) films grown by molecular beam epitaxy it was demonstrated that the p-type conductivity is associated with acceptor-like states that result from intrinsic point defects.165,166 GeSi/Si heterostructure research found that the main source of holes in SiGe layers is clusters of intrinsic point defects, which are formed due to interaction of dislocations, but not individual dislocations.209 Likely, the applied high pressure can also modify the defect structure of the Ge-dominant Si–Ge samples and somehow affect these acceptor-like levels. However, as seen from their thermopower data for the cubic-diamond phase (Fig. 5 and 6), these acceptor-like levels were very robust, and the samples conserved the p-type conductivity despite the apparent irreversible changes in their electronic properties resulting from the defect structure modification. As also seen from these thermopower data (Fig. 5 and 6), the irreversible changes occurred only on the first pressure cycle, and from the second cycle the pressure-induced variations were reversible. The irreversible changes in the electronic properties of the samples after their quenching from high pressure to ambient conditions could be, to some extent, linked to residual strains.
4.2. Potential innovative applications of the Si–Ge alloys
The highly spectacular pressure-driven variations in the Seebeck coefficients in the Si–Ge alloys we revealed in this work (Fig. 5–10) hint that these and associated effects can have industrial potential. In practical applications, the applied-pressure effect can be simulated by various methods, which are easier to implement. They include, for example, thin epitaxial films deposited on appropriate substrates, in which high internal strains corresponding to pressures of up to 20 GPa can be created,210,211 and nanoindentation with a hard tip, which can generate high stresses in microscopic areas at the sample surface.212,213 Stress-controlled switches are already utilized in a number of technological processes and electronic devices. For example, on the basis of the nanoindentation technique a new concept of data recording was offered and a novel memory device was developed by IBM company.214,215 It was demonstrated on a sample of silicon that by using the nanoindentation method one can “write” electrically-conductive areas (metastable Si-III phase) on the surface of semiconducting silicon,212 as well as can stabilize another metastable phase, r8 (Si-XII).216 These metastable phases can persist under ambient conditions as long as they are not annealed.217,218 Note here that such ‘pre-compressed’ metastable phases can be prepared also either by high-pressure torsion,219,220 or by other techniques even not using high pressure, e.g., by colloidal synthesis.221
Apparently, the pressure-induced changes in the Seebeck coefficient of the Si–Ge alloys are of potential interest for thermoelectric applications of these materials.10–21 However, it is more interesting that the effects we discovered suggest that these inexpensive and environment-friendly materials have potential for the use in nanoelectronic devices as ‘smart’ elements whose optoelectronic properties can be controlled or switched by applied stress. In Fig. 13 we present several simple stress-related applications of the Si–Ge alloys, which can be surmised from the thermopower data. High stresses on the surface of these alloys can be generated, for example, by electronically-controlled hard tips (Fig. 13(a)). This technique can be used to ‘write’ zones or electrical circuits with different types of electrical conductivities on the surfaces of the Si–Ge alloys. These ‘written’ zones look rather simple from the top (Fig. 13(b)), but, in fact, because of the stress distribution under the applied hard tip the depth profiles of these zones may be intricate. For example, we found that pure Ge with n-type intrinsic electrical conductivity irreversibly changes into a p-type semiconductor under applied pressure above 3 GPa (Fig. 5(a) and 13(c)). Higher stresses somewhat above the semiconductor–metal phase transition point76,77,83–92 can stabilize the metastable st12 phase (Ge-III) with the n-type conductivity after stress release (Fig. 7(a) and 13(c)). This treatment should also lead to the formation of an intermediate p-type layer with the original cubic-diamond structure because of the stress distribution in the sample (Fig. 13(c)). In germanium crystals with a moderate Si content the p-type conductivity became dominant in the original phase, and for the Si content somewhat exceeding 7 at.% the p-type conductivity was conserved in the metastable st12 phase too (Ge-III) (Fig. 7(d)). For the lower Si content this metastable phase had an n-type conductivity as in pure Ge (Fig. 7(b) and (c) and 13(d)).

(b) Top view of hypothetical the Si–Ge substrate, in which, the electrical conductivity types may be inverted by an appropriate applied stress, as displayed in detail in (c)–(e). This example illustrates “writing” the zones or circuits of different electrical conductivities. (c–e) Depth profiles of zones whose electrical conductivity was modified by applied stress. (c) An applied stress above 3 GPa can irreversibly turn the conductivity of n-type Ge to p-type (Fig. 5(a)), thereby creating a p–n junction. An applied stress higher than 14 GPa can fabricate the metastable st12 polymorph (Ge-III) after stress release (Fig. 7(a) and (b)). This will form also an underlying p-type layer of Ge-I because of the stress distribution under the hard tip, thereby creating a n–p–n layered structure. (d) In p-type Ge slightly substituted with Si (p-SixGe1−x) one can form similar layers of the metastable st12 polymorph (Ge-III) by an applied stress above 14 GPa, but the electrical conductivity in these layers can have both n- and p-types, depending on the Si content (Fig. 7). (e) Applied stresses of 1–2 GPa can switch the conductivity of p-type Si slightly substituted with Ge (p-Si1−xGex) to n-type; for stresses less than 1 GPa this p–n inversion is reversible, but for stresses above 1.5 GPa it becomes irreversible (Fig. 9(b)). Applied stresses of 2–4 GPa can change p-Si1−xGex into a strongly compensated state with nearly equal partial conductivities of holes and electrons (shown as n ≈ p) (Fig. 9(a)). Higher applied stresses exceeding 14 GPa allow the formation of the metastable Si-III polymorph with p-type conductivity after stress release (Fig. 10). This treatment will also result in the formation of two intermediate layers with the compensated (p ≈ n) and n-type conductivity between the p-Si-III layer and p-Si1−xGex substrate. 
The thermopower data for the p-type Si1−xGex crystals with a low Ge content disclosed more options for the electrical conductivity variation depending on the applied stress value (Fig. 9 and 10). For example, a minor applied stress of about 1–2 GPa inverted the conductivity to n-type, whereas higher applied stresses irreversibly changed Si0.974Ge0.026 into the strongly compensated state (i.e., with nearly equal p- and n-type partial conductivities) (Fig. 9(a) and 13(e)). Much higher applied stresses above the semiconductor–metal phase transition point76–80,86–88,93–96,155–157 resulted in the formation of the metastable bc8 phase (Si-III) with a p-type conductivity after stress release (Fig. 10(b)). However, two intermediate layers, one with the compensated and the other with the n-type conductivity, should be formed here also because of the stress distribution (Fig. 9 and 13(e)). The above cases are only the simplest options on how to implement the high-pressure effects in Si1−xGex alloys revealed in our work. In real applications, this approach may be extended to fabricate much more intricate cascades of diodes, transistors, and entire integrated circuits.
Conclusions
We synthesized several Si- and Ge-dominant Si–Ge crystals (Si0.974Ge0.026, Si0.02Ge0.98, Si0.07Ge0.93, Si0.13Ge0.87, and Ge) and investigated the applied high-pressure effect on their thermoelectric and electrical properties in the pressure range up to 17 GPa at room temperature under multiple pressure cycling. In addition, the crystal structure of the samples was examined by Raman spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction. We found that the thermoelectric power value of these Si–Ge samples in their original cubic-diamond-type phases can be crucially changed by the applied pressure. In some cases even the sign inversion of the Seebeck coefficient occurred under the applied pressure. Across the phase transitions on pressurization and decompression cycles the thermoelectric power of the Si–Ge crystals was significantly varied too. We found that after high-pressure cycling the Si-dominant samples transformed into a cubic bc8 phase (Si-III) with a p-type electrical conductivity, whereas the Ge-dominant alloys changed into a tetragonal st12 phase (Ge-III) whose conductivity type depended on the Si content. Thus, our work demonstrated how one can control the thermopower of Si–Ge alloys. The unusual pressure behaviour of the Seebeck coefficient of Si–Ge crystals we disclosed points out that they may be promising for diverse industrial applications, in which the optoelectronic properties of elements are controlled or switched by tuning the applied stress.

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  The cubic-diamond crystal structure of (a) germanium slightly substituted with silicon, SixGe1−x and (b) silicon slightly substituted with germanium, Si1−xGex. (c) Composition dependence of the fundamental indirect energy gap of Si–Ge alloys replotted from the literature data for relaxed solid solutions (open circles connected by a solid curve, from ref. 43). The red arrows correspond to the compositions we investigated in this work.	 

 	Fig. 2  (a) A simplified scheme of the high-pressure cell with semispherical cavities in the anvils that was used for the thermoelectric measurements. 1 – Sample, 2 – sample container made of limestone, 3 – anvils, 4 – supporting plungers. The electrical probes show how the thermoelectric voltage (ΔU) and the temperature difference (ΔT) were measured. (b) Examples of the Seebeck coefficient determination from linear slopes, as S = −ΔU/ΔT at fixed pressures for different Si–Ge alloys. 1 – The metastable Ge-III-type phase of Si0.02Ge0.98 at about 0 GPa, 2 – Si0.974Ge0.026 at about 0 GPa after recovery from 2 GPa, 3 – Si0.974Ge0.026 at about 10 GPa, 4 – Si0.13Ge0.87 at about 0 GPa, 5 – Si0.07Ge0.93 at about 0 GPa.	 

 	Fig. 3  Raman spectra of the Si–Ge alloys under ambient conditions. The insets in (a and b) show the selected magnified parts of these spectra. A photograph of the bulk Si0.974Ge0.026 single crystalline sample is given in (b).	 

 	Fig. 4  Selected crystal structures of silicon and germanium. (a) Under ambient conditions both silicon and germanium crystallize in the cubic-diamond-type structure with the Fdm space group, #227 (known as Si-I and Ge-I). (b) Under applied high pressure above 9–13 GPa this diamond-type structure transforms into a metal β-Sn-type structure with the I41/amd space group, #141 (known as Si-II and Ge-II). (c) On decompression the β-Sn-type structure of Ge usually transforms into a metastable st12 structure with the P43212 space group, #96 (known as Ge-III), which can be quenched under ambient conditions. (d) On decompression the β-Sn-type structure of Si firstly transforms into a metastable r8 structure with the R space group, #148 (known as Si-XII), and (e) then, on pressure release, transforms into a metastable bc8 structure with the Ia space group, #206 (known as Si-III). Rarely, depending on stress conditions, after pressure release Ge can also adopt the same structure as Si-III (e) (known as Ge-IV).	 

 	Fig. 5  Pressure dependencies of the thermoelectric power of the Ge-dominant Si–Ge alloys at 295 K under high-pressure cycling below the semiconductor–metal phase transition point (about 10 GPa). (a) n-Type Ge. (b) Si0.02Ge0.98. (c) Si0.07Ge0.93. (d) Si0.13Ge0.87. The thin arrows indicate the directions of pressure variation.	 

 	Fig. 6  Comparison of the pressure behaviour of the thermoelectric power of the Ge-dominant Si–Ge alloys at 295 K from Fig. 5(a) for the first pressurization cycle and (b) for the second pressurization and decompression cycles. (a) Above 1 GPa all the samples demonstrate rather similar dependencies of the Seebeck coefficients under pressure. (b) All the curves exhibit a drop about 3–6 GPa marked by the bulk arrow for Si0.02Ge0.98. The thin arrows indicate the directions of pressure variation.	 

 	Fig. 7  Pressure dependencies of the thermoelectric power of the Ge-dominant Si–Ge alloys at 295 K across the phase transition to the metal β-Sn-type structure (Ge-II) about 10 GPa for selected pressure cycles for (a) p-type Ge, (b) Si0.02Ge0.98, (c) Si0.07Ge0.93, and (d) Si0.13Ge0.87. The thin arrows indicate the directions of pressure variation. After the first decompression cycle, the metastable Ge-III-type phase was formed. Hence, the second and following pressure cycles should correspond to the Ge-III → Ge-II phase transition. The bulk arrows indicate anomalies, which should be linked to the phase transitions. The insets in (c) and (d) show the magnified parts of the thermopower curves, which demonstrate these anomalies more distinctly.	 

 	Fig. 8  The metastable Ge-III-type phase in the Ge-dominant Si–Ge alloys and its characterization at 295 K. (a) Photograph in transmitted light of a limestone sample container (it is labelled as 2 in Fig. 2(a)) with one of the Si–Ge samples recovered from the high-pressure experiments. (b) Example of an azimuth X-ray diffraction image in the full range of 0–360° for the Si0.07Ge0.93 sample. This corresponds to the 1D diffraction pattern of this sample shown below in (d). (c) Raman spectra of the samples recovered from the high-pressure-cycling experiments to about 17 GPa (Fig. 7). The dashes indicate the wavenumbers reported for the Ge-III phase in ref. 156. (d) X-ray diffraction patterns for the same samples as in (c). The Ge-III-type crystal structure of the samples was confirmed by Rietveld refinement. For pure Ge a simulated pattern (thick solid line) together with the calculated reflection positions (dashes) for this structure is given. The asterisks in the pattern for the Si0.13Ge0.87 sample point out peaks related to the remains of the limestone container. (e) Pressure dependencies of the electrical resistance for the Si–Ge samples across the Ge-III → Ge-II phase transition (marked by the bulk arrow on the sample of Ge). (f) Pressure dependencies of the thermoelectric power of the Si–Ge samples across the Ge-III → Ge-II phase transition, from Fig. 7. The bulk arrows indicate the direct and return phase transitions. The thin arrows in (e) and (f) indicate the directions of pressure variation.	 

 	Fig. 9  Pressure dependencies of the thermoelectric power for two samples (#1 and #2) of Si0.974Ge0.026 below the semiconductor–metal phase transition point at 295 K. The thin arrows indicate the directions of pressure variation. The inset in (a) shows a pressure dependence of the electrical resistance for sample #1 for two pressurization cycles. The insets in (b) show the pressure and time dependencies of the thermopower for sample #2 on relaxation release from a pre-compression run to 0.75 GPa. On this decompression a return n–p sign inversion of the Seebeck coefficient occurs about 0.55 GPa.	 

 	Fig. 10  The formation of the metastable Si-III phase in Si0.974Ge0.026 and its characterization at 295 K. (a) Pressure dependencies of the thermoelectric power of sample #3 of Si0.974Ge0.026 across the phase transition to the metal β-Sn-type phase (Si-II) about 11–13 GPa for three pressure cycles. The thin arrows indicate the directions of pressure variation. After the first decompression run Si0.974Ge0.026 transformed into the metastable Si-III-type phase. The inset in (a) depicts a pressure dependence of the electrical resistance of this sample across the Si-III → Si-II phase transition. (b) Magnified pressure dependencies of the thermoelectric power from (a), which demonstrate smooth bends in the region of the phase transition to the metal β-Sn phase about 11 GPa. The decompression cycles exhibit a dip about 4 GPa and a minimum at ∼0.6 GPa (better shown in the inset), which could be related to the phase transitions to the metastable phases Si-XII and Si-III, respectively. The second and third pressurization cycles show a feature about 2 GPa that could be linked to the Si-XII → Si-III phase transition. (c) Raman spectrum of the metastable Si-III phase of Si0.974Ge0.026 collected from the sample recovered from the high pressure experiments to 17 GPa (a and b). The wavenumbers are given near the peaks. Data from the literature for Si-III phase, based on the studies by OJ156 and HS,155 are shown by dashes. (d) X-ray diffraction pattern of the metastable Si-III phase of Si0.974Ge0.026 collected from the sample recovered from the high-pressure cycling experiments to about 17 GPa (a and b). The Si-III-type crystal structure was confirmed by Rietveld refinement; a simulated pattern is shown by a solid line, and the calculated reflection positions are shown by dashes. The inset in (d) shows a quarter of a 2D X-ray diffraction image of this sample.	 

 	Fig. 11  (a) Photographs of a central part of a high-pressure diamond anvil cell with the Si0.974Ge0.026 sample (marked by a bulk blue arrow) at selected pressures on pressurization run. A ruby ball in the Centre was used for pressure determination. Above 16 GPa Si0.974Ge0.026 demonstrates a metallic lustre consistent with the Si-I → Si-II phase transition.76–80,86–88,93–96,155–157 Raman spectra evolution for the Si0.974Ge0.026 crystal on (b) pressurization and (c) decompression cycles indicated the semiconductor–metal phase transition between 13 and 16 GPa, and the transitions to the metastable structures on pressure release. The asterisks mark the parasite peaks. The pressure values are given near the selected spectra. (b) The inset shows the magnified parts of the Raman spectra in the metal phase. The spectra collected at 16 and 16.9 GPa correspond to the Si-II phase, whereas the one at 18 GPa and above – to the Si-V phase, which has no Raman active modes.87 (c) The metastable phase Si-III was quenched under ambient conditions. The wavenumbers in the spectrum of Si-III are given near the peaks. They were consistent with previous studies.155,156	 

 	Fig. 12  Pressure dependencies of the wavenumbers of the Si0.974Ge0.026 crystal for pressurization and decompression cycles. (a) The wavenumber of the main LO phonon exhibits a kink in its pressure curve at 2 GPa. The inset shows the intensity variation of this LO phonon peak under pressure. (b) The phonon at 430 cm−1, which is shown in the inset and assigned to the 2TA(Σ) silicon mode, also exhibits a kink at 2 GPa. It seems that this phonon peak probably splits above 3 GPa. (c) Wavenumbers of the other phonon modes of Si-I, Si-II, Si-III, and Si-XII phases. The inset illustrates the phase transition between the metastable phases, Si-XII → Si-III on pressure release.

 	Fig. 13  Potential innovative applications of Si–Ge alloys. (a) Schematic side view of hard tip for surface indentation. (b) Top view of hypothetical the Si–Ge substrate, in which, the electrical conductivity types may be inverted by an appropriate applied stress, as displayed in detail in (c)–(e). This example illustrates “writing” the zones or circuits of different electrical conductivities. (c–e) Depth profiles of zones whose electrical conductivity was modified by applied stress. (c) An applied stress above 3 GPa can irreversibly turn the conductivity of n-type Ge to p-type (Fig. 5(a)), thereby creating a p–n junction. An applied stress higher than 14 GPa can fabricate the metastable st12 polymorph (Ge-III) after stress release (Fig. 7(a) and (b)). This will form also an underlying p-type layer of Ge-I because of the stress distribution under the hard tip, thereby creating a n–p–n layered structure. (d) In p-type Ge slightly substituted with Si (p-SixGe1−x) one can form similar layers of the metastable st12 polymorph (Ge-III) by an applied stress above 14 GPa, but the electrical conductivity in these layers can have both n- and p-types, depending on the Si content (Fig. 7). (e) Applied stresses of 1–2 GPa can switch the conductivity of p-type Si slightly substituted with Ge (p-Si1−xGex) to n-type; for stresses less than 1 GPa this p–n inversion is reversible, but for stresses above 1.5 GPa it becomes irreversible (Fig. 9(b)). Applied stresses of 2–4 GPa can change p-Si1−xGex into a strongly compensated state with nearly equal partial conductivities of holes and electrons (shown as n ≈ p) (Fig. 9(a)). Higher applied stresses exceeding 14 GPa allow the formation of the metastable Si-III polymorph with p-type conductivity after stress release (Fig. 10). This treatment will also result in the formation of two intermediate layers with the compensated (p ≈ n) and n-type conductivity between the p-Si-III layer and p-Si1−xGex substrate.
