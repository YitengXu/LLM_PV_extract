    AbstractA novel AgIO4 semiconductor has been prepared via a facile precipitation method. It exhibited much higher activity than Ag3PO4 or Ag3AsO4 in photodegradation of rhodamine B under visible-light irradiation. The ultrahigh activity of AgIO4 is attributed to the photosensitization mechanism of the photodegradation process.
Development of semiconductor photocatalysts for sunlight utilization is increasingly becoming an important research topic owing to the global energy shortage. Solar energy conversion through photocatalysis needs to maximize the utilization of visible light, and the dye-sensitized semiconductors have been widely studied for this purpose. Many dye-sensitized semiconductors, such as dye-sensitized TiO2 and carbon nitride, have been successfully applied to visible-light-induced hydrogen production1 and pollutant degradation2 in aqueous solution, photoelectric conversion in solar cells,3 or photocatalytic organic synthesis.4 Although success has been achieved in the study of dye-sensitized semiconductors, the obtained photosensitization efficiency is still low and the insight for the important factors influencing photosensitization is deficient. Therefore, it is still highly desirable to develop novel semiconductor materials for efficient photosensitization-based utilization of solar energy and to research the relevant photosensitization mechanism.
As a highly efficient visible-light-responsive photocatalyst, Ag3PO4 semiconductor has attracted much attention because it showed higher photocatalytic activity than the currently known photocatalysts including BiVO4, N-doped TiO2, etc., in water oxidation and photodegration of organic compounds.5 Very recently, we reported a novel photocatalyst, Ag3AsO4, which achieved higher photodegradation activity than Ag3PO4 in degradation of rhodamine B (RhB) or methyl orange under irradiation of visible light.6 In this work, we developed another new semiconductor, AgIO4, through a facile precipitation process (see ESI for experiment details†). Notably, its activity is much higher than Ag3PO4 or Ag3AsO4 in photodegradation of RhB under visible-light irradiation. It was found that the ultrahigh photogradation activity of AgIO4 is closely related to the self-sensitization of RhB. In addition, the key factor influencing photosensitization efficiency was proposed based on the study of the photodegradation mechanism of AgIO4 in degradation.
Silver and iodine contents of the AgIO4 sample were measured to be 35.2 wt% and 43.6 wt%, respectively, by ICP-MS technique. The contents are quite close to the corresponding theoretical values of pure AgIO4 compound, confirming the successful preparation of AgIO4. Fig. 1a displays the photo and SEM image of the AgIO4 sample. It is yellow and mostly has rhombic shape with particle size of 3–15 μm. The XRD pattern of AgIO4 is shown in Fig. 1b. Tens of sharp diffraction peaks can be clearly observed at 2θ of 20–90°, indicating that crystalline phase of the sample is highly ordered. The diffraction peaks in its XRD pattern cannot be indexed to the only existing AgIO4 phase (PDF #10-0368) in the current database of powder diffraction file, which implies that the obtained AgIO4 has a new crystalline phase that had not been discovered before. Yet there are not much data on the crystalline phase of AgIO4 and its structure–activity relationship. The UV-vis DRS of AgIO4 (Fig. 1c) shows that it absorbs visible light, and the absorption band edge is around the wavelength (λ) of 468 nm. The band gap of a crystalline semiconductor can be estimated be 2.65 eV according to the reported method (Fig. 1d, see ESI for estimation details†).7

The photodegradation activity of AgIO4 was tested in degradation of RhB under different conditions (Fig. 2a). It took AgIO4 only 10 min to completely degrade RhB. Our previous work showed that Ag3PO4 and Ag3AsO4 need 25 and 20 min to completely degrade RhB, respectively, under the same experimental conditions.6 Moreover, at the degradation time of 2 to 6 min, AgIO4 exhibited much higher degradation rate than Ag3PO4 and Ag3AsO4. The results indicated that AgIO4 is much more active than Ag3PO4 and Ag3AsO4 in photodegradation of RhB.

(d) photocatalytic activity of Ag3PO4 or Ag3AsO4 under irradiation of monochromatic visible-light centered at a wavelength of 550, 495 or 470 nm in degradation of RhB. Herein, C is the concentration of the RhB aqueous solution at a certain reaction time, C0 is the origin concentration of RhB before photocatalyst was added. 
Taking into account the fact that the RhB dyes can also harvest visible light, we designed experiments of RhB degradation over the AgIO4 photocatalyst under irradiation of different monochromatic visible-light to test the possible effect of photosensitization. It can be observed from UV-vis absorption spectrum (Fig. 2b) that in the visible light region the RhB dyes are most excited by light with λ = 553 nm. However, AgIO4 can be excited only by the light with λ ≤ 500 nm. Therefore, we first used monochromatic light centered at a wavelength of 550 nm (Δλ = ±19 nm) to selectively excite the RhB molecule, RhB was still degraded quickly. Although the complete degradation took 40 min, most of RhB were degraded in 15 min (Fig. 2c). In contrast, when monochromatic light centered at a wavelength of 420 nm (Δλ = ±17 nm) was used to excite the AgIO4 photocatalyst while minimizing the excitation of the RhB dyes, RhB was degraded much more slowly. In this case, complete degradation of RhB was not observed even in 60 min. Accordingly, the self-sensitization of RhB, but not the intrinsic photocatalytic performance of AgIO4, played a pivotal role in degradation of RhB under visible-light irradiation.
To gain insight into the degradation mechanism of AgIO4 in RhB degradation, we calculated the band structure of it. The valence band (VB) and CB potentials of AgIO4 at the point of zero charge can be calculated by the formulas:8EVB = X – Ee + 0.5Eg, ECB = EVB – Eg, in which EVB or ECB are the VB- or CB-edge potentials of AgIO4, respectively, X is the absolute electronegativity of AgIO4 which is defined as the geometric mean of the absolute electronegativity of its constituent atoms. X was thus estimated to be 6.78 eV for AgIO4. Ee is the energy of free electrons on the hydrogen scale (ca. 4.5 eV), and Eg is the band gap of AgIO4, i.e., 2.65 eV. Based on the above equations, EVB and ECB of AgIO4 were calculated to be 3.61 eV and 0.96 eV, respectively (Fig. 3).

It is known that the LUMO and HOMO of RhB are at the potentials of −1.42 and 0.95 eV, respectively.2 Apparently, the ECB of AgIO4 is much higher than the LUMO potential of the RhB molecule, and interestingly the HOMO potential of RhB is very close to the ECB of AgIO4. As a result, the electron injection from the excited RhB molecules into the CB of AgIO4 could be favored substantially, and the deexcitation of RhB was minimized in the present photodegradation system. Simultaneously, RhB itself were efficiently degraded with the aid of high oxidizing-power of the formed RhB+ cations (Fig. 3).
It was reported that the CB edge potential and the wavelength of absorption band edge of Ag3PO4 (ref. 5a) are 0.45 eV and 530 nm respectively, and the counterparts of Ag3AsO4 (ref. 6) are 0.62 eV and 730 nm respectively. In order to provide more insights into the photodegradation mechanism of RhB, we carried out control experiments under irradiation of monochromatic light with Ag3PO4 and Ag3AsO4 as photocatalysts. These results are shown in Fig. 2d. No obvious degradation of RhB was observed over the Ag3PO4 photocatalyst under the irradiation of light with λ = 550 nm. This result is consistent with the previous report in which Ag3PO4 was shown to be inactive in photosensitization degradation of methylene blue.5a Therefore, Ag3PO4 is almost incapable of degrading RhB through photosensitization process.
Since 495 or 550 nm is the wavelength of light that can excite both the RhB molecule and the Ag3AsO4 photocatalyst, the photodegradation activity obtained over Ag3AsO4 under the irradiation of monochromatic light with λ = 495 or 550 nm includes two parts: the photosensitization activity and the photocatalytic activity. Because the RhB dyes show poor light-absorption at the wavelength of 495 nm, the overwhelming majority of the photodegradation activity of Ag3AsO4 obtained at this wavelength can be ascribed to the photocatalysis mechanism. The shorter wavelength of incident light means the stronger excitation energy and hence the more photogenerated carriers in photocatalytic process. Thus, it can be well understood that the photocatalytic activity of Ag3AsO4 obtained under irradiation of 470 nm (Δλ = ±16 nm) light is significantly higher than its photodegradation activity under the irradiation of 495 nm (Δλ = ±16 nm) light (Fig. 2d), even though the irradiation intensity of 470 nm light is lower than that of 495 nm light under the actual experimental conditions of photodegradation (Fig. S1†).
For the same reason, it is logical to believe that the photocatalytic activity of Ag3AsO4 under 550 nm light irradiation, if obtained separately, is significantly lower than that obtained under 495 nm light irradiation. However, the overall photodegradation activity of Ag3AsO4 obtained under the irradiation of 550 nm light is quite close to the counterpart under the irradiation of 495 nm light (Fig. 2d), although the irradiation intensity of 550 nm light is remarkably lower than that of 495 nm light (Fig. S1†). These results suggested that the photosensitization activity of Ag3AsO4 under 550 nm light irradiation is pronounced. It is thus inferred that Ag3AsO4 has higher photosensitization activity than Ag3PO4 in RhB degradation. Under 550 nm light irradiation, the photodegradation activity of Ag3AsO4, namely the summation of its photocatalytic activity and photosensitization activity (Fig. 2d), is much lower than the photosensitization activity of AgIO4 (Fig. 2c). So the photosensitization activity of Ag3AsO4 is lower than that of AgIO4.
On the basis of the above results, a conclusion can be reached that under the irradiation of 550 nm light, the decreasing photosensitization activity was obtained over the photocatalysts following the order: AgIO4 > Ag3AsO4 > Ag3PO4. As shown above, the value of the CB-edge potential of these photocatalysts, i.e., 0.96 eV, 0.62 eV and 0.45 eV, in turn decreases following the same order. The energy-level matching between the dye and the photocatalyst is the thermodynamic prerequisite of the electron injection from dye to photocatalyst in photosensitization.1,9 Thus, it is natural to believe that the much higher CB-edge potential of AgIO4 than the LUMO potential of the RhB molecule is the driving-force leading to the high photosensitization activity of AgIO4, and that the ultrahigh photodegradation activity of AgIO4 is due to its unique band structure.
One can see that the VB potential of AgIO4 is very high, probably resulting in strong oxidizing-ability of its photogenerated holes. More interestingly, the photogenerated holes are powerful enough to oxidize the soluble Ag+ ions into silver monoxide, i.e., AgO. Fig. 4 gives the XRD pattern and photo of the AgIO4 photocatalyst that had been used in RhB degradation once. In the pattern the diffraction peaks of AgO (PDF #84-1547) at 2θ of 31.9°, 34.3°, 63.6° and 64.5° can be clearly observed (Fig. 4). Correspondingly, the used AgIO4 changed to black, characteristic of the color of AgO. It is noteworthy that no diffraction peaks of metallic Ag can be observed in the XRD pattern (Fig. 4). The result confirmed that it is not energetically possible for Ag+ ions to be reduced into metallic Ag by the photogenerated electrons of AgIO4, which can be judged from the data of its band structure (Fig. 3).
 Fig. 4  XRD pattern and photo of the AgIO4 photocatalyst that had been used once in RhB degradation, and XRD pattern of this photocatalyst after being washed with dilute nitric acid (0.03 mol L−1). 
To test the activity lifetime of the AgIO4 photocatalyst, we recycled the AgIO4 photocatalyst in RhB degradation. In the recycling run, the AgIO4 photocatalyst exhibited a very low activity (Fig. 2a). It was postulated that the formed AgO on the surface of AgIO4 might deteriorate the electron injection from the excited RhB molecule to AgIO4, and hence the photosensitization efficiency. This may be the reason for the decreased photodegradation activity of AgIO4 in the recycling run. But if the used AgIO4 photocatalyst was washed with a dilute nitric acid (0.03 mol L−1) before recycling run, the ultrahigh degradation activity recovered. Similarly, it took the acid washed AgIO4 only 10 min to completely degrade RhB (Fig. 2a). The XRD pattern of the acid washed AgIO4 was provided in Fig. 4, which is just the same as that of fresh AgIO4 (Fig. 1b).
In summary, we successfully prepared a new semiconductor, AgIO4, through a facile precipitation method. Its ultrahigh activity was highlighted by comparison with Ag3PO4 and Ag3AsO4 in photodegradation of RhB under visible-light irradiation. The self-sensitization of RhB is the dominant mechanism for AgIO4 in the degradation process. More importantly, we found that the photosensitization activity of AgIO4, Ag3AsO4 and Ag3PO4 is band-structure dependent. This finding demonstrated that much higher CB-potential of the semiconductor than the LUMO potential of the dye molecule is of benefit to photosensitization. This work presented a promising semiconductor that can be used in degradation of organic pollutants by photosensitization, and the band-structure effect described here may open up new opportunities for the development of efficient semiconductor materials for the photosensitization-based utilization of solar energy. Moreover, because of the ultrastrong photooxidization-ability of AgIO4, its excellent photocatalytic performance in oxygen evolution from water is conceivable, and worthy of further research.
