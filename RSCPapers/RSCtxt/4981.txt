    First published on 6th July 2017AbstractFullerenes have the characteristic of a hollow interior, and this unique feature triggers intuitive inspiration to entrap atoms, ions or clusters inside the carbon cage in the form of endohedral fullerenes. In particular, upon entrapping an otherwise unstable metal cluster into a carbon cage, the so-called endohedral clusterfullerenes fulfil the mutual stabilization of the inner metal cluster and the outer fullerene cage with a specific isomeric structure which is often unstable as an empty fullerene. A variety of metal clusters have been reported to form endohedral clusterfullerenes, including metal nitrides, carbides, oxides, sulfides, cyanides and so on, making endohedral clusterfullerenes the most variable and intriguing branch of endohedral fullerenes. In this review article, we present an exhaustive review on all types of endohedral clusterfullerenes reported to date, including their discoveries, syntheses, separations, molecular structures and properties as well as their potential applications in versatile fields such as biomedicine, energy conversion, and so on. At the end, we present an outlook on the prospect of endohedral clusterfullerenes.

1. Introduction
The discovery of C60 as the most representative fullerene by the late Kroto, Smalley and co-workers in 1985 opened a new era of nanocarbons.1 Among all allotropes of elemental carbon known to date, fullerene is the only one with a molecular form.2 One of the unique structural characteristics of fullerenes is their hollow interior, and this naturally triggers intuitive inspiration to entrap atoms into the carbon cage so as to tailor the molecular and electronic properties of fullerenes.3–6 Indeed, soon after the discovery of C60, the possibility of entrapping La atoms into the fullerene cage was hypothesized on the basis of mass spectrometric detection of a C60La complex by Smalley et al.,7 and such a hypothesis was experimentally confirmed with the first solvent extractable endohedral fullerene La@C82 by the same group.8 Later on, the unique electronic structure of La@C82 was revealed with an electronic configuration of La3+@C823−, featuring a three-electron transfer from the entrapped La atom to the C82 fullerene cage.9 It is such an intramolecular charge transfer that renders endohedral fullerenes with new properties inaccessible by empty fullerenes such as C60. From then on, the research on endohedral fullerenes has been primarily driven by understanding the electronic properties of novel endohedral fullerenes in comparison to the empty fullerenes.10
A breakthrough in fullerene research occurred in 1999, when an unprecedented molecule—Sc3N@C80 as the first member of the metal nitride clusterfullerenes (NCFs)—was discovered by Dorn et al. via introducing a small portion of nitrogen gas into the Krätschmer–Huffman generator during vaporization of graphite rods containing metal oxides.11 Because of the higher yield of Sc3N@C80 than that of all other endohedral fullerenes reported previously, the discovery of NCF marked a groundbreaking advance in fullerene research. Besides, from the point of view of the molecular structure of NCFs such as Sc3N@C80, the entrapped metal nitride cluster Sc3N, which is unstable as a single species, is stabilized by the fullerene cage, while the C80 cage has an isomeric form (Ih), which is often unstable as an empty fullerene. Therefore, the NCF structure fulfils the mutual stabilization of the inner metal nitride cluster and the outer fullerene cage with a specific isomeric structure.12,13 Both experimental and theoretical studies revealed that a six-electron transfer from the entrapped Sc3N cluster to the outer C80 cage occurred and this was responsible for the unordinary stability and high yield of Sc3N@C80 NCF.14,15
The conceptual novelty of NCFs soon stimulated the idea of stabilizing other types of metal clusters by fullerene cages. In 2001, Shinohara et al. identified that the previously supposed dimetallofullerene “Sc2@C86” was actually Sc2C2@C84 as proved by a NMR study, featuring the encapsulation of a metal carbide cluster within the fullerene cage.16 The experimental finding of Sc2C2@C84 as the first metal carbide clusterfullerene (CCF) is important because multimetallofullerenes (especially dimetallofullerenes) might exist in the form of CCFs containing a C2 moiety in the interior of the fullerene cage, and thus special care should be taken to determine the actual molecular structures of multimetallofullerenes.17,18
Following the advances in NCFs and CCFs, several other types of metal clusters were found to form similar endohedral structures within the fullerene cage during the past decade, dramatically expanding the family of endohedral clusterfullerenes. In addition to NCFs and CCFs, nowadays the known endohedral clusterfullerenes include metal oxide clusterfullerenes (OCFs),19 metal sulfide clusterfullerenes (SCFs),20 and metal cyanide clusterfullerenes (CYCFs),21 as well as metal hydrocarbon/carbonitride clusterfullerenes.22,23 Thus, clusterfullerenes represent now the most variable and intriguing branch of endohedral fullerenes. The diversity of the composition of the entrapped metal cluster resulted from changing the number/combination of metal(s) and/or non-metal atom(s) bringing about many peculiar properties of clusterfullerenes, which are superior to or even inaccessible by conventional metallofullerenes. For example, since the entrapped non-metal atom (N and/or C) generally located at the center of the fullerene cage imposes a strong ligand field and then provides anisotropy for single molecule magnetism, endohedral clusterfullerenes containing 4f-lanthanide metals (Ln) were found to behave as single molecule magnets (SMMs),24–28 which have potential applications in spintronics, quantum computing and high-density storage devices.29–32
In this review article, we present an exhaustive review on all types of endohedral clusterfullerenes reported to date, including their discoveries, syntheses, separations, molecular structures and properties. We focus on the discussion of the molecular structures of endohedral clusterfullerenes to understand their structural feature in comparison with the conventional metallofullerenes and empty fullerenes as well as their correlation with the peculiar properties of endohedral clusterfullerenes. The potential applications of endohedral clusterfullerenes in versatile fields such as biomedicine and photovoltaics are also discussed, followed by an outlook on the prospects of endohedral clusterfullerenes.
2. The recent state of endohedral clusterfullerenes
2.1. Categories of endohedral clusterfullerenes
During the past two decades, the family of endohedral fullerenes has been considerably enlarged by endohedral clusterfullerenes particularly NCFs and CCFs. On the basis of the type of entrapped metal cluster (specifically the non-metal atom), endohedral clusterfullerenes can be categorized as seven classes, including NCFs, CCFs, OCFs, SCFs, CYCFs, metal hydrocarbide clusterfullerenes (HCCFs) and metal carbonitride clusterfullerenes (CNCFs). Table 1 presents an exhaustive list of all of the endohedral clusterfullerenes reported to date, including also the method used to elucidate their molecular structures. For a more intuitive summary, we plot a modified periodic table in which all endohedral clusterfullerenes are highlighted and classified by using different color codes (see Fig. 1). Interestingly, it can be clearly seen that the entrapped metals of the reported endohedral clusterfullerenes are predominately based on rare earth (group-3 or group-IIIB) metals, and most metals like Sc can form multiple types of endohedral clusterfullerenes. This indicates the peculiarity of endohedral clusterfullerene in diversifying the form of endohedral fullerenes.

 Fig. 1  A modified periodic table in which all endohedral clusterfullerenes are highlighted and classified by using different color codes. The circles indicate elements which are able to form endohedral fullerenes including both conventional metallofullerenes and endohedral clusterfullerenes. 
Like the conventional endohedral fullerenes, all endohedral clusterfullerenes are synthesized using the Krätschmer–Huffman DC arc-discharge method, which needs however modification in some cases through introducing an additive containing the involved non-metal atom (such as N, O, and S) in the raw material.5 Likewise, the well-developed separation approaches for the conventional endohedral fullerenes can be applied in separating endohedral clusterfullerenes, typically based on high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with recycling mode required in some cases (e.g. separation of isomers). Besides, chemical and electrochemical separation methods have been also developed to separate specifically endohedral clusterfullerenes.34–39 Structural characterization of endohedral clusterfullerenes follows the methods developed for the conventional endohedral fullerenes as well, including mainly single-crystal X-ray crystallography, 13C NMR spectroscopy and IR spectroscopy combined with DFT calculations.12 In particular, the relatively sophisticated geometric structures of the entrapped metal clusters can be unveiled only by single-crystal X-ray crystallography (see Section 3.1). The detailed discussions on the synthesis, separation and structural characterization of endohedral fullerenes including endohedral clusterfullerenes have been summarized in several recent general or specialized reviews and book chapters,3–6,12,13,40–42 such as a comprehensive review by Popov, Yang and Dunsch in 2013,5 and a dedicated review by Lu, Akasaka and Nagase et al. in 2012.4 In this review we present a focused overview of different aspects of all endohedral clusterfullerenes reported to date emphasizing the new advances after 2013.
2.2. Metal nitride clusterfullerenes (NCFs)
In 1999, a fire-new molecule—Sc3N@C80—as the first member of NCFs was discovered by Dorn et al. stemming from an accidental leakage of a small portion of nitrogen into the arc-discharging chamber during vaporization of a mixture of graphite powder and metal oxide.11 Because the entrapped species comprised three metal atoms and one non-metal atom (N), such a pioneering technique is named as the “trimetallic nitride template” (TNT). One striking feature of NCFs is their high yield, especially Sc3N@C80, which is the highest among all endohedral fullerenes that have been found to date and even exceeds that of the known abundant empty fullerene C84 whose yield typically ranks the third of all empty fullerenes (after C60 and C70). Such a high production yield facilitates further investigation of their chemical/physical properties and significantly boosts the subsequent development of endohedral clusterfullerenes.12–15,43
The discovery of Sc3N@C80 marked a groundbreaking advance in fullerene research as evidenced by the follow-up extensive studies on its electronic, chemical and physical properties.12–15,43 To date, Sc3N@C80 is still the record-keeping “star” in terms of the production yield among all endohedral fullerenes. Besides, the unprecedented molecular structure of NCFs featuring the encapsulation of a four-atomic metal nitride cluster in the interior of the fullerene cage set off a new upsurge in endohedral fullerene research. Thus, it is not surprising that many new advances have been achieved in NCFs during the past decade, including the synthesis, separation, molecular structures and properties. Moreover, some of the recent findings even subvert the initial understanding of NCFs.

2.2.1. Progress in synthesis. 
Synthesis is the premise for the further study of NCFs. Stimulated by the success of the TNT technique, which is based on the modification of the Krätschmer–Huffman DC arc-discharge method via introducing nitrogen gas (N2) as the nitrogen source,11 several new modification methods have been developed towards the synthesis of NCFs, and can be generally classified into two categories according to the form of the nitrogen source, namely organic and inorganic nitrogen-containing compounds.
2.2.1.1. Inorganic nitrogen sources. 
(1) TNT technique. 
By using nitrogen gas (N2) as the nitrogen source, which was introduced into the Krätschmer–Huffman generator during vaporization of graphite rods containing metal oxides, the TNT technique was established by Dorn et al., leading to the discovery of Sc3N@C80 as the first member of NCFs.11 Indeed, the TNT technique fulfilling the concept of stabilizing a trimetallic nitride cluster which is unstable as a single species with a fullerene cage has been demonstrated to be a useful template to entrap various metals other than Sc. Among the NCFs isolated so far (see Table 1), more than half were synthesized using the TNT technique. By the end of 2013,5 the TNT technique had been successfully employed to synthesize the following NCFs with different cage sizes and isomers based on homogeneous group-3 metals, including Sc3N@C2n (2n = 68, 78, 80),11,44–54 Y3N@C2n (2n = 78–88),55–60 Gd3N@C2n (2n = 78–88),61–67 Tb3N@C2n (2n = 80, 84–88),68–71 Er3N@C80,11 Tm3N@C2n (2n = 80, 84)66,72–74 and Lu3N@C2n (2n = 80, 88).76,78
Since 2014 several new homogeneous NCFs have been synthesized via the TNT technique by different groups. In 2014, Dorn and coworkers synthesized and isolated Tm3N@C88, whose molecular structure was definitively determined by single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis, revealing the D2(35)-C88 isomer with a planar Tm3N cluster entrapped inside.77 In addition to Tb3N@C88 reported by the same group earlier, Tm3N@C88 is the largest NCF in terms of the cage size that has been crystallographically identified. Noteworthily, the D2(35)-C88 isomeric structure of Tm3N@C88 is similar to the previously reported C88-based NCFs such as Y3N@C88 and Lu3N@C88 as determined by the 13C NMR study and DFT calculations, respectively, but totally different from that of La3N@C88 with a Cs(31)-C88 isomeric cage structure proposed by DFT computation.78 The difference between the isomeric cage structures of M3N@C88 (M = Tm, La) can be reasonably explained by different sizes of the entrapped metal atoms. Such a size effect of the entrapped unit resulting in different cluster–cage interactions plays a substantial role in determining the molecular structure and stability of NCFs as discussed in detail in Section 3.
Interestingly, as an intriguing member of the Sc–NCF family, Sc3N@C82 has been detected using mass spectroscopy by different groups focusing on the study of Sc-based endohedral fullerenes, but its successful separation has not been accomplished for more than a decade due to its low kinetic stability arising from the small bandgap as predicted theoretically. The extreme difficulty in separating the long-sought small-bandgap Sc3N@C82 has been recently solved by our group.79 As the prerequisite we first accomplished high yield (milligram scale) synthesis of Sc3N@C82 by using the TNT technique. Upon successful separation, the molecular structure of Sc3N@C82 was unambiguously determined by single crystal X-ray diffraction to be C2v(39718)-C82, which is consistent with the most stable isomeric structure for the C82 cage predicted by DFT calculations. Interestingly, the identified isolated pentagon rule (IPR)-obeying C2v(39718)-C82 isomeric cage of Sc3N@C82 is dramatically different from those of the reported analogous NCFs M3N@Cs(39663)-C82 (M = Gd, Y) based on a non-IPR C82 isomer, indicating the strong dependence of the cage isomeric structure on the size of the encaged metal.12,13,59,65,80
Except for the homogeneous NCFs, mixed metal NCFs (MMNCFs), for which two or three different metals are mixed in the entrapped trimetallic nitride cluster,81 have also been synthesized based on the TNT technique. These include MxSc3−xN@C80 (x = 0–3, M = Y,82 La,83 Gd,84 Tb,84 Er,85), AxSc3−xN@C68 (x = 0–2; A = Tm, Er, Gd, Ho, La),44 ScYErN@C80,82 CeSc2N@C80,86 GdxM3−xN@C80 (x = 1, 2, M = Ho, Lu),87 LuxA3−xN@C80 (x = 1, 2, A = Gd, Ho),87 TiM2N@C80 (M = Sc,88 Y89) and VxSc3−xN@C80 (x = 1, 2).90 Compared to the homogeneous NCFs, MMNCFs feature a boost in the yield of homogeneous NCFs based on group-3 metals with a large ionic radius, and are more advantageous in increasing the structural variability by simply changing the composition of the entrapped mixed metal nitride.81 Given that Sc can direct the formation of the Sc-based MMNCFs due to the high yield of Sc-NCFs as compared to homogenous NCFs based on other metals, the MMNCF strategy has been successfully employed towards the discoveries of two new types of MMNCFs which involve the non-group-3 metals.88,90 In 2009 our group successfully synthesized the first NCF involving a non-group-3 metal. By mixing TiO2 and Sc2O3 in the raw metal oxide materials, group-4 transition metal Ti was entrapped into the fullerene cage via the TNT technique in the form of NCFs for the first time. Noteworthily, the synthesis of Ti-containing MMNCF—TiSc2N@Ih-C80 demonstrates the possibility of entrapping Ti into the fullerene cage in a form other than the reported metal carbide and dimetal.87 Such a success in entrapping a non-group-3 metal into the fullerene cage in the form of NCFs is significant since it opens a new avenue to entrap other non-group-3 metals into the fullerene cage so as to enlarge the versatility of NCFs. Indeed, very recently our group succeeded in entrapping the group-5 transition metal vanadium (V) into the fullerene cage for the first time, by using again the TNT technique. Two novel V-containing MMNCFs, VxSc3−xN@C80 (x = 1 and 2), were synthesized and separated, whose molecular structures were unambiguously determined by single crystal X-ray diffraction to be the Ih(7)-C80 cage entrapping the planar VSc2N/V2ScN clusters.90
On the other hand, different to the cases of Sc-based MMNCFs (MxSc3−xN@C2n) for which the yield of the homogeneous Sc-NCFs dominates that of the M-based homogeneous NCFs, non-Sc-based MMNCFs (i.e., without involvement of Sc) provide an ideal platform to address an interesting issue regarding whether the formation of the homogeneous NCFs based on two different group-3 metals would compete during the formation of MMNCFs. Very recently Wang and co-workers successfully synthesized two new types of non-Sc-based MMNCFs, GdxHo3−xN@C80 and GdxLu3−xN@C80, by using the TNT technique. IR spectroscopy in combination with DFT calculations was employed to reveal their isomeric cage structures, which were proposed to be Ih-C80.87
(2) The “reactive gas atmosphere” route. 
In 2003 Dunsch and coworkers developed an alternative method to synthesize NCFs by introducing a small amount of NH3 as the reactive gas in an arc-discharge furnace. Surprisingly, the formation of both empty fullerenes and conventional metallofullerenes is dramatically suppressed as evidenced by their extremely low yield of less than 5%, whereas NCFs are produced as the dominant product with a yield even higher than 95%. Consequently, a highly selective synthesis of NCFs was achieved for the first time. Such an advantage enables the applicability of the “reactive gas atmosphere” route in synthesizing a large number of NCFs, including both homogeneous NCFs and MMNCFs, such as M3N@C2n (M = Gd,64,91,92 Tb,93 Dy,94 Ho,93 Tm;73 38 ≤ n ≤ 44; M = La,95 Ce,96 Pr,96 Nd;96 40 ≤ n ≤ 48), Sc3N@C70,97 GdxSc3−xN@C80 (I, II, x = 0–2),98,99 DySc2N@C76,100 HoxSc3−xN@C80 (x = 1, 2),101 LuxSc3−xN@C80 (x = 1, 2),102,103 MSc2N@C68 (M = Dy, Lu),104 Lu2ScN@C68,104 and LuxY3−xN@C80 (I, x = 0–2).102 In particular, different to the cases of Sc-based MMNCFs (MxSc3−xN@C2n) for which the yield of the homogeneous Sc-NCFs dominates that of the M-based homogeneous NCFs, non-Sc-based MMNCFs (i.e., without involvement of Sc) provide an ideal platform to address an interesting issue regarding whether the formation of the homogeneous NCFs based on two different group-3 metals would compete during the formation of MMNCFs. By isolating the first non-Sc-based MMNCFs, LuxY3−xN@C80 (x = 1 and 2), Yang and Dunsch et al. estimated the relative yields of LuY2N@C80 and Lu2YN@C80 MMNCFs relative to the homogenous Y3N@C80 and Lu3N@C80 NCFs. It was found that the yield of LuY2N@C80 was ca. 1.3 times that of Lu2YN@C80 and the yield of Y3N@C80 was ca. 2.3 times that of Lu3N@C80. The abrupt reversal of the relative yields for the synthesis of homogeneous NCFs using pure Lu2O3 or Y2O3 suggests a complicated competition effect taking place when two metals with comparable ionic radii are mixed to form the MMNCFs.102
(3) Inorganic solid nitrogen sources. 
Before 2004 the synthesis methods for NCFs were limited to N2 and NH3 which are both gaseous nitrogen sources, and generally a heating pretreatment up to 1000 °C is needed to “activate” the metal (or metal oxide) to form a carbide structure prior to arc discharging, thus requiring an additional heating furnace or an in situ heating procedure. Thus, it is desirable to substitute the gaseous nitrogen sources so as to simplify the procedure. In 2004 Dunsch and coworkers developed an inorganic solid nitrogen source, calcium cyanamide (CaNCN), which was added to the graphite mixture to the same extent as the metal content. With this innovative approach, the yield and selectivity of Sc3N@C80 were significantly improved.70 However, unfortunately, the low reproducibility of this method probably due to traces of water and/or hydrocarbons in the raw material makes it inapplicable in the synthesis of other NCFs. Inspired by this idea, in 2007 Stevenson and coworkers reported a “Chemically Adjusting Plasma Temperature, Energy, and Reactivity” (CAPTEAR) method for synthesizing NCFs by utilizing an inorganic nitrogen-containing compound Cu(NO3)2·2H2O as an additive, which would decompose into NOx gases, N2, and O2 for their in situ release into the electric-arc reactor. Using this CAPTEAR method, the formation of empty-cage fullerene is suppressed while the decomposed Cu functions as a catalyst additive to offset the reactive plasma environment, contributing jointly to the selective synthesis of Sc3N@C80 with improved yield.105 Later on, the same group synthesized a metallic nitride azafullerene La3N@C79N by using the same CAPTEAR method in 2009, and found that its yield exceeded even La3N@C96.106
In 2013 our group developed a series of nitrogen-containing inorganic solid compounds with variable valence states of nitrogen as new nitrogen sources, including ammonium salts [(NH4)xH3−xPO4 (x = 0–2), (NH4)2SO4, (NH4)2CO3, NH4X (X = F, Cl), NH4SCN], thiocyanate (KSCN), nitrates (Cu(NO3)2, NaNO3) and nitrite (NaNO2). Among them, ammonium phosphates [(NH4)xH3−xPO4, (x = 1–3)] and ammonium thiocyanate (NH4SCN) were revealed to behave as better nitrogen sources than others, and the highest yield of Sc-NCFs was achieved when NH4SCN was used as a nitrogen source (see Fig. 2). Analysis of the thermal decomposition behavior of these nitrogen-containing compounds provided helpful insight to understand their different performances toward the synthesis of Sc-NCFs, and the dependence of the production yield of Sc-NCFs on the oxidation state of nitrogen and the counter ions is unveiled.107

2.2.1.2. Organic solid nitrogen sources. 
In addition to the frequently used inorganic nitrogen sources, some organic solid nitrogen sources have been applied to synthesize NCFs as well. In 2010 Yang and Dunsch et al. used two organic compounds named as guanidinium thiocyanate and guanidinium hydrochloride as a new nitrogen source, and achieved high yield synthesis of NCFs based on different group-3 metals. Noteworthily, the yield of M3N@C80 based on the so-called “selective organic solid (SOS)” method is comparable to that obtained by using a gaseous NH3 source. Compared with the traditional gaseous method (the TNT technique or the “reactive gas atmosphere” route), SOS has a significant advantage that no additional heating pretreatment is required, thus simplifying the procedure and being much more facile.108
In view of the attractive advantage of the SOS method, some new achievements were reported recently. In 2014 Popov and coworkers successfully synthesized a series of Sc (Y)/Ce-based MMNCFs CexM3−xN@C2n (M = Sc, Y) with the cage size distributing from C78 to C88. Deeper study revealed that the small-sized entrapped metal Sc/Y serves as the scaffold metal to modulate the intra-stress between the interior CexM3−xN cluster and outer fullerene cages, which has a prominent impact on their electronic electrochemical properties.109 Later on, a number of Sc, Lu, and Y/Ho MMNCFs were synthesized via this SOS method by the same group.110 They further investigated the effect of the cluster size variation, by gradually increasing the radii of entrapped metal ions from Sc to Lu and then to Y, on the paramagnetic properties of Ho-based NCFs, and pointed out that the size of the inside unit had a remarkable influence on its chemical shift in 13C NMR spectra. This is because increasing the size of the encaged metal from Sc to Lu and to Y renders stepwise shortening of the Ho–N distance, which will finally increases the ligand-field splitting. On the other hand, the induced change in the coordination of the interior moiety to the carbon cage accounts for this variation as well to some extent. More recently, in addition to the commonly known Ih and D5h isomers of C80, a new isomer of Sc/La-based MMNCF, LaSc2N@C80, was successfully synthesized and isolated by Popov and coworkers. A crystallographic study reveals the Cs symmetry for the carbon cage. Interestingly, different from the structures of the previously reported NCFs, for which the carbon cage is only composed of pentagons and hexagons, the newly found LaSc2N@Cs-C80 isomer contains an extra heptagon except for the general pentagons and hexagons, representing the first non-classic heptagon-containing endohedral fullerene.111
In 2015, our group successfully synthesized a large family of Dy/Sc MMNCFs, DyxSc3−xN@C2n (x = 1, 2, 2n = 68, 70, 76–86), by using the SOS method. After the separation, we performed an FTIR spectroscopic study in combination with DFT computation, fulfilling reasonable assignments of the cage isomeric structures of DyxSc3−xN@C2n. Noticeably, compared to the GdxSc3−xN@C2n (2n = 78–88) MMNCF family, the cage size distribution of DyxSc3−xN@C2n (x = 1, 2, 2n = 68, 70, 76–86) is apparently larger. This is because the entrapped medium-sized Dy metal is more suitable to interact with the carbon cage, leading to stabilization of Dy/Sc MMNCFs with more expanded cage size distribution. As a result DyxSc3−xN@C2n MMNCFs represent the largest MMNCF family reported so far.112
Apart from the guanidinium salts, another organic solid nitrogen-rich compound, urea (CO(NH2)2), which is much cheaper than the guanidinium salts, was recently developed as a new nitrogen source by our group. Based on a quantitative and comparative study of Sc3N@C80 NCFs by using different nitrogen sources such as N2, NH3 and guanidinium thiocyanate, urea was revealed to behave as an alternative nitrogen source affording selective synthesis of Sc3N@C80 NCFs with the yield being almost identical to that by using N2.113
Melamine was also applied by Popov and coworkers as an effective organic solid nitrogen source towards the synthesis of NCFs. By using this method, a large family of Sc/Gd-based MMNCFs, ScxGd3−xN@C2n (2n = 78–88), were synthesized, and their isomeric cage structures were proposed by vibrational spectra combined with DFT calculations. For ScxGd3−xN@C2n (2n = 78–88) MMNCFs, both GdSc2N and Gd2ScN units can be entrapped in a medium-sized carbon cage such as C80 and C82, whereas by increasing the carbon cage size to C88, only the Gd2ScN moiety can be detected. Such a progressive decrease of the number of Sc atoms for the large cage can be interpreted by weakening the interaction between the carbon cage and GdSc2N cluster because of the smaller size of the GdSc2N cluster compared to the Gd2ScN cluster.114


2.2.2. Separation of NCFs. 
To date, a few separation techniques have been established for NCFs, which follow the approaches developed for separating the conventional endohedral fullerenes, typically based on high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Several recent reviews, especially the focused ones published by Yang et al. in 20113 and by Stevenson and Dorn et al. in 2013,5 have described the separation methods of NCFs developed before 2013 in detail. Generally, they can be divided into two categories: one is HPLC techniques, and the other is chemical approaches. Until now, HPLC has still been the most powerful and frequently used technique for the separation of NCFs, and in some cases multi-step separation involving recycling mode is required especially for the separation of isomers or MMNCFs,11,44,82–104 and the columns filled with various types of stationary phases play a decisive role in the performance of separation based on their different selectivities on the cage size, molecular weight, shape or other properties of NCFs.
Since HPLC isolation is generally tedious and unfavorable for high-throughput and large-scale separation, non-chromatographic methods were thus developed to overcome such shortcomings. According to the difference in the oxidation potentials of Sc3N@Ih-C80 and Sc3N@D5h-C80, in 2005 Echegoyen and coworkers realized the separation of these two isomers of Sc3N@C80 using an electrochemical method for the first time.115 In the same year, Dorn and coworkers took advantage of the higher reactivity of empty fullerenes compared to NCFs, and accomplished one-step separation of a series of M3N@C80 from the as-prepared mixture through reaction with a reactive cyclopentadiene-functionalized styrene-divinylbenzene resin.36 In 2008, the same group reported the separation of NCFs by a chemical reaction of congeners with eutectic 9-methylanthracene. In this process the highly reactive empty fullerenes and metallofullerenes formed derivatives with 9-methylanthracene, which can be easily removed by using a proper solvent (diethyl ether). The residual unreacted NCF can be obtained by dissolving in toluene.37
Utilizing a similar strategy, in 2006 Stevenson et al. applied cyclopentadienyl- and amino-functionalized silica to selectively immobilize empty fullerenes and non-NCFs via chemical reactions, while the relatively inert NCFs remained in solution and could be directly separated by filtration. They figuratively named this method as the “stir and filter approach” (SAFA).34 Later on, the same group fulfilled the separation of Sc3N@Ih-C80 from Sc3N@D5h-C80 by using this method.38 It is noteworthy that the bound empty fullerenes and metallofullerenes were previously discarded as wastes due to the lack of a recovery strategy. In 2014, Stevenson and coworkers developed a novel recovery method by adding CS2 to spent aminosilica resulting in the release of these absorbed fullerenes.116 Taking Er- and Gd-based metallofullerene as examples, the final released products were even more than seventy percent.
In 2009, Stevenson and coworkers introduced Lewis acids such as FeCl3 and AlCl3 for separation of NCFs, in which NCFs reacted quickly with Lewis acids and generated precipitation, while the empty fullerenes were largely unreacted. Manipulation of the Lewis acids according to the different reactivity toward different types of NCFs resulted in a selective precipitation and purification of Sc3N@Ih-C80.35 Recently, the same group incorporated CuCl2 as a new Lewis acid for the separation of NCFs (see Fig. 3). In this method CuCl2 was proved to selectively precipitate the high-reactivity endohedral clusterfullerenes including NCFs and other clusterfullerenes within minutes of reaction time, whereas the more inert empty fullerenes and metallofullerenes remained in the solution, leading to successful separation of NCFs from the as-produced soot. The authors claimed that the first oxidation potentials of endohedral clusterfullerenes primarily determined the purification efficiency. Those with the first oxidation potential below 0.19 V can be readily complexed, while those such as empty fullerenes and metallofullerenes that possessed a first oxidation potential above the threshold (0.19 V), showing a relative chemical inertness, tended to remain in solution. Additionally, CuCl2 was used for effective separation of isomers of Er2@C82 (Er2@C82 (I) and Er2@C82 (III)) due to the lower first oxidation potential of the former isomer which was inclined to react with CuCl2.117 In 2015, Stevenson and coworkers successfully achieved purification of CeLu2N@C80 MMNCF by using the Lewis acid method coupled with the SAFA approach mentioned above. Specifically, firstly CeLu2N@C80 was sedimentated by complexation with MgCl2. Then, the SAFA approach was applied to eliminate the residual contaminants which gave rise to pure CeLu2N@C80.118

Due to the different cycloaddition reversibility between NCFs and empty fullerenes, the retro-cycloaddition reaction provides another effective avenue to separate NCFs from empty fullerenes. In 2013, Wang and coworkers succeeded in separating a series of M3N@C80 (M = Sc, Ho, Lu) via this strategy. They first functionalized a mixture of C60, C70 and M3N@C80 (M = Sc, Ho, Lu) via a 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reaction and obtained the corresponding (metallo)fulleropyrrolidines. An oxidant 3-chloroperbenzoic acid was then added under 40 °C to recover the pristine M3N@C80 (M = Sc, Ho, Lu) in a yield of 86.1% within 30 min via retro-cycloaddition, whereas the more stable C60 and C70 fulleropyrrolidines remained unreacted, and could be easily removed by using silica gel column chromatography.119 This simple and efficient technique is deemed to be a powerful tool to separate NCFs and may be further extended to separate other types of clusterfullerenes.

2.3. Metal carbide clusterfullerenes (CCFs)
Metal carbide clusterfullerenes (CCFs) are another important branch of the endohedral clusterfullerene family, for which a carbide moiety C2 together with metal atoms are entrapped inside a fullerene cage.3,5,120 Sc2C2@C84 was the first CCF identified by Shinohara and coworkers in 2001, which was initially proposed to be Sc2@C86 erroneously.16 Its carbide nature was later confirmed by the same group utilizing 13C NMR coupled with synchrotron X-ray structural studies. The discovery of Sc2C2@C84 as the first CCF significantly increases the variability of multimetallofullerenes (especially dimetallofullerene such as Sc2@C86) which may exist in the form of either CCFs or genuine multimetallofullerenes.16 In fact, numerous previously reported metallofullerenes were later confirmed as CCFs.121

2.3.1. Synthesis of CCFs. 
Usually, the synthesis method for CCFs is the same as that used for synthesizing the conventional metallofullerenes without requiring additives. To date, a wealth of CCFs entrapping multiple (2–4) metal atoms has been synthesized by using the unmodified Krätschmer–Huffman DC-arc discharge method. Among them, dimetallic CCFs have been most extensively studied. For example, three isolated isomers of Sc2@C84 were proved by Akasaka et al. in 2011 and 2012 to be carbide structures, namely Sc2C2@C3v(8)-C82, Sc2C2@Cs(6)-C82 and Sc2C2@C2v(9)-C82.121,122 One isomer of Sc2C82 also turned out to be a CCF with the form of Sc2C2@C2v(5)-C80.122–124 Such a carbide nature has been also confirmed for Sc2C70(Sc2C2@C2v(6073)-C68) by Wang et al. in 2006. Noticeably, Sc2C2@C2v(6073)-C68 is a non-IPR (IPR = isolated pentagon rule) structure with two pairs of fused pentagons.125 However, the carbide structure of Sc2C2@C68 is somewhat controversial because a recent theoretical result indicated that the dimetallofullerene Sc2@C2v(7854)-C70 structure with three pairs of adjacent pentagons was preferred.126 Recently, Wang and coworkers synthesized a new CCF, Sc2C2@Cs(10528)-C72, that bears two pairs of adjacent pentagons. The crystallographic and 13C NMR spectroscopic studies definitely revealed its molecular structure featured as a CCF. This was the second member of the non-IPR CCFs. Moreover, theoretical calculation suggests a closed-shell structure with an electronic configuration of [Sc3+]2[C2]2−@[C72]4−, which was further confirmed by the electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy study for its anion radical, for which a hyperfine structure accompanied by a 15-line spectrum was observed.127 Upon enlarging the cage size, Sc2C2@C86 CCF exhibited a C2v(9) isomeric cage entrapping a planar, twisted Sc2C2 carbide unit according to the X-ray crystallographic study.128 The recently discovered Sc-based dimetallic CCF Sc2C2@C88 isolated by Echegoyen and coworkers surprisingly turned out to have a non-classic fullerene cage composed of an unprecedented heptagon along with 13 pentagons and 32 hexagons. Such non-classic heptagon-containing endohedral fullerenes are rather rare, and to our knowledge only one example of LaSc2N@C80 as discussed above was reported before.129 Thus, Sc2C2@C88 represents the first heptagon-containing non-IPR CCF. Inspired by this work, the idea of capturing heptagons in the form of endohedral clusterfullerenes should be considered.
Except for Sc-based dimetallic CCFs, tremendous dimetallic CCFs based on other lanthanide metals were also isolated during the past decade, including Er2C2@C82,130 Gd2C2@C2n (2n = 88–92),131,132 Y2C2@C2n (2n = 82, 84, 92, 100),133–138 Ti2C2@C78,139–142 Dy2C2@C82,143 Tm2C2@C82,144 and mixed metal carbide clusterfullerene CCF ErYC2@C82.145 Additionally, Tb2@C84 was confirmed to take the carbide form as well by our group. The molecular structure of Tb2@C84 was explicitly determined to be Tb2C2@Cs(6)-C82 by X-ray crystallographic study. For the entrapped Tb2C2 unit, the two Tb ions are located beneath hexagons and junctions of hexagons, respectively, and the whole Tb2C2 cluster is more rigidly constrained (more bent) compared to that in the reported Sc2C2@Cs(6)-C82.146 More recently, Lu and coworkers synthesized and isolated a series of La-based CCFs La2C2@C2n (2n = 90–104),147–149 especially including three members of giant CCFs, with the cage size ranging from C100 even to C104. Crystallographic studies gave accurate isomeric structures of D5(450), Cs(574) and C2(816) for La2C2@C100, La2C2@C102 and La2C2@C104, respectively. Among them, La2C2@C2(816)-C104 represents the largest CCF isolated to date, and its isolation reveals the importance of geometrical matching between the carbide cluster and fullerene cage in stabilizing the CCFs.
Unlike dimetallic CCFs for which the entrapped M2C2 carbides are symmetric, whether trimetallic CCFs exist remained a mystery until 2005, when Akasaka and coworkers identified that the erroneously assigned multimetallofullerene “Sc3@C82” was actually Sc3C2@Ih-C80 according to the NMR spectroscopic results, which represents the first endohedral clusterfullerene entrapping a five-atom cluster.150 In 2011, Wang et al. isolated another trimetallic CCF, Lu3C2@C88, which exhibits a planar Lu3C2 cluster entrapped in a D2-symmetric C88 cage. Compared to the Lu3N@C88 NCF, Lu3C2@C88 owns an unpaired electron localized on the internal [Lu3C2]6+ moiety while Lu3N@C88 has a closed-shell electronic structure despite their similarity in formal six electron transfer according to DFT theoretical studies.76
Upon increasing the number of atoms for the entrapped cluster, it is surprising that a six-atom cluster, Sc4C2, can be entrapped within a fullerene cage as well according to a report by Wang et al. in 2009. The isolated tetrametallic CCF, Sc4C2@C80 was proposed to exhibit a Russian-doll nesting structure according to the FTIR and Raman spectroscopic study in combination with DFT calculations, and a highly charged C2 moiety was predicted according to the DFT-computed electronic configuration of [C2]6−@[Sc3+]4@[Ih-C80]6−.151 Along with the trimetallic CCFs, the existence of such multimetallic CCFs raises an open question regarding whether an even larger carbide cluster could be entrapped.
In 2014, Popov and coworkers synthesized unexpectedly a new type of CCF—TiLu2C@C80—by using various types of nitrogen sources such as NH3, melamine and nitrogen as well as methane (see Fig. 4). Dramatically different from the previously found CCFs within which the C2 moiety was observed, the newly discovered TiLu2C@C80 contains only one central μ3-C atom inside and an unprecedented double TiC bond was proposed. Intuitively, TiLu2C@C80 did not contain any nitrogen, accordingly, the synthesis was simplified under a He atmosphere without any nitrogen source. However, no TiLu2C@C80 was detected. Finally, NH3 and methane were determined to be the best gas atmosphere for the synthesis of TiLu2C@C80.152 More recently, the same group synthesized and isolated a series of analogous structures, including TiM2C@C80 (M = Lu, Er, Dy, Y, Gd) as well as one of the congeners TiDy2C2@C80. The magnetic properties of both TiDy2C@C80 and TiDy2C2@C80 revealed that substitution of a single carbide ion (C) with a general C2 moiety in CCFs created a deleterious effect on the single-molecule magnet (SMM) properties.26 Besides, by adding melamine as an additive into the Krätschmer–Hummffman generator during vaporization of graphite rods packed with a mixture of Sc/Ti oxides, a series of mixed-metal CCFs Sc2TiC@C2n (2n = 68, 78, 80) and Sc2TiC2@C80 were also synthesized and two isomers of Sc2TiC@C80 as well as Sc2TiC2@C80 were successfully isolated by the same group.153

2.3.2. Separation of CCFs. 
Similar to NCFs, at present HPLC remains the most widely used technique for the separation of CCFs. Upon applying several specialized HPLC columns running in multi-step and even recycling mode, various CCFs have been isolated. In addition, in 2012 Shinohara and coworkers developed a rapid and efficient approach for the separation of CCFs together with conventional metallofullerenes from empty fullerenes by utilizing TiCl4 as the Lewis acid to complex the CCFs. Within 10 min, CCFs and metallofullerenes can be purified with a high purity of nearly 99% without the need for HPLC.39

2.4. Metal oxide clusterfullerenes (OCFs)
As the third type of endohedral clusterfullerenes, metal oxide clusterfullerenes (OCFs) were discovered by Stevenson et al. in 2008. Innovative introduction of non-metal atom oxygen to form an oxygen-based metal cluster for stabilizing the fullerene cage opens up an important branch of endohedral clusterfullerenes. The first structurally characterized OCF was Sc4(μ3-O)2@Ih-C80, within which two oxygen atoms were identified by single crystal X-ray diffraction.19 To date, a dozen of OCFs containing different numbers of entrapped oxygen atoms as well as various cage sizes have been synthesized and separated.

2.4.1. Synthesis of OCFs. 
At the early stage of metallofullerene research, oxygen was generally believed to be an adverse substance for the formation of metallofullerenes. Thus, oxygen was initially avoided as far as possible in the preparation process of metallofullerenes. However, pioneered by Stevenson et al., introducing a small portion of flowing air as an additive during the synthesis of Sc-based endohedral fullerenes led to the generation of OCFs with various types such as Sc4O2@C80, Sc4O3@C80 and Sc2O@C82. Clearly, the minor component of gaseous O2 existing in the air plays a crucial role in the formation of OCFs. Further investigation suggests that an air flow rate of 12 Torr min−1 was the optimized condition for the synthesis of OCFs. Additionally, the CAPTEAR method developed for synthesizing NCFs has also been applied to synthesize OCFs by Stevenson and coworkers.19,154–156
Recently, Feng and Chen et al. developed a new additive, gaseous CO2, as the oxygen source, and succeeded in synthesizing a large family of Sc-based OCFs, Sc2O@C2n (2n = 70–94). Interestingly, under a comparative synthesis condition by using a He/air atmosphere, a large amount of NCFs along with conventional metallofullerenes and empty fullerenes were obtained, whereas only traces of OCFs were detected. When a pure He atmosphere was utilized, the yield of conventional metallofullerenes as well as CCFs is overwhelmingly higher than that of OCFs. Accordingly, the authors concluded that CO2 can be used as an effective oxygen source better than air to promote the formation of OCFs.157


2.4.2. Separation of OCFs. 
Upon the successful synthesis of the first OCFs in an isolable quantity, Stevenson and coworkers employed the SAFA method, which was initially developed by them used for the separation of NCFs, to separate OCFs leading to successful separation of Sc4O2@C80 and Sc4O3@C80 from the as-prepared soot mixture while HPLC was required for final purification.19,155,156 Additionally, by using Lewis acids such as AlCl3 or FeCl3 as a complexant to selectively precipitate OCFs, a similar separation performance can be achieved. Ultimately, one step HPLC separation enables pure compounds to be obtained. More detailed discussions on the separation of OCFs by using Lewis acids can be found in our previous review in 2011.3 It is worth emphasizing that HPLC is still the most powerful technique to purify OCFs, which readily gives rise to successful separation of several newly discovered members of OCFs including Sc2O@C2n (2n = 70, 76, 78, 80), Sc3O@C80 and a new isomer of Sc2O@C82 by Feng and Chen et al.157–163

2.5. Metal sulfide clusterfullerenes (SCFs)
The possibility of capturing sulfur (S) atoms into the carbon cage results in discovery of the S-containing endohedral clusterfullerenes, named as metal sulfide clusterfullerenes (SCFs), by Dunsch and Yang et al.20 To date, several types of SCFs with different cage sizes have been synthesized and isolated.

2.5.1. Synthesis of SCFs. 
As discussed above, guanidium thiocyanate (CH5N3·HSCN) as a nitrogen-rich organic solid nitrogen source was initially applied to produce NCFs, known as the SOS method. Intriguingly, along with the formation of NCFs using the SOS method, SCFs were generated simultaneously with the HSCN moiety acting as the sulfur source. Sc2S@C82 was the first structurally characterized SCF synthesized and separated by Dunsch and Yang et al. in 2010, while SCFs based on other lanthanide metals such as M2S@C82 (M = Dy, Y, Lu) were also isolated.20 Accordingly, CH5N3·HSCN is proved to be a universal additive for the synthesis of SCFs. Distinct from two other precedents of endohedral clusterfullerenes, namely NCFs and OCFs, for which the Ih-C80 cage is preferred, in the case of SCFs the C82 cage is the dominating cage. This indicates the influence of the entrapped cluster on the structure of the outer fullerene cage.
Obviously, the presence of sulfur element in the organic sulfur source plays a key role in the formation of SCFs. Taking a similar concept, several months later Echegoyen et al. introduced a small quantity of SO2 as an alternative sulfur source, and succeeded in synthesizing a large family of Sc2S@C2n (2n = 80–100) SCFs.164,165 This is apparently different from the case of using guanidinium thiocyanate as the sulfur source, for which only one isomer of Sc2S@C3v(8)-C82 was detected. Such a difference in the cage size distribution suggests that the sulfur source has a significant effect on the formation of SCFs, and this opens a new route for the exploration of this emerging endohedral clusterfullerene family. More recently, the same group isolated several new SCFs, including Sc2S@C2n (2n = 70, 72)166,167 and Ti2S@C78.168 Among them, Ti2S@C78 is quite unusual in terms of the linear geometry of the entrapped Ti2S cluster (different to the V-shaped geometry of Sc2S within Sc2S@C82) and its formal transfer of six electrons to the C78 cage (different to the four-electron transfer for Sc2S@C82) according to DFT calculations.


2.5.2. Separation of SCFs. 
At present, there are no other effective methods to separate SCFs except for HPLC. Separation of SCFs can be effectively fulfilled by HPLC running with various types of columns. Taking the first SCF, Sc2S@C82, as an example, Dunsch and Yang et al. managed to separate it by two-step HPLC by successively running on a Buckyprep column and then on a Buckyprep-M column.20 Using a similar strategy, Sc2S@C2n (2n = 70, 72) and Ti2S@C78 SCFs were successfully separated by Echegoyen and coworkers.166–168

2.6. Metal cyanide clusterfullerenes (CYCFs)
All endohedral clusterfullerenes discussed above are stabilized by entrapping a metal cluster that requires multiple (two to four) metal cations coordinated with a non-metal ion. On the other hand, since the discovery of the first separable endohedral fullerene La@C82, monometallofullerenes tend to exist in the simple form of M@C2n with a single metal atom entrapped. Thus, it seems improbable to entrap a single metal atom in the form of a metal cluster within the fullerene cage. This dogma has been broken with the discovery of the first metal cyanide clusterfullerene (CYCF)—YNC@C82—by our group.21

2.6.1. Synthesis of CYCFs. 
YNC@C82 was the first CYCF, which was synthesized by our group using a modified Krätschmer–Huffman DC arc-discharge method via vaporizing a composite graphite rod containing a mixture of Y2O3, TiO2 and graphite powder under a N2/He mixed atmosphere, which is the same as the TNT technique used for the synthesis of NCFs. Note that there is no Ti contained in YNC@C82, thus a reference synthesis by using a mixture of pure Y2O3 and graphite powder was also carried out under the same conditions. Interestingly, YNC@C82 formed only in the existence of TiO2 in the crude mixture, suggesting the essential role of TiO2 for the formation of YNC@C82. Nevertheless, the necessity of TiO2 for the synthesis of CYCFs seems not applicable for other CYCFs such as TbNC@C82 and TbNC@C76 which were synthesized by our group more recently.27,28,169 Production yields of TbNC@C82 with and without the existence of TiO2 in the crude mixture were compared, and it was found that TbNC@C82 formed under both conditions despite the difference in the yield, suggesting the dependence of the formation of CYCF on the nature of the entrapped rare earth metal.


2.6.2. Separation of CYCFs. 
Presently, only a few CYCFs have been reported, and their separations relied on HPLC. For instance, separation of YNC@C82 was accomplished using multi-step HPLC running in recycling mode performed on various types of columns including 5PYE and Buckyprep-M. Using the same strategy, our group successfully separated three isomers of TbNC@C82 (C2(5), Cs(6), C2v(9)) as well as TbNC@C76 which is the first non-IPR CYCF.27,28,169

2.7. Metal hydrocarbide clusterfullerenes (HCCFs)
In 2007, Dunsch and coworkers used a modified Krätschmer–Huffman DC arc-discharge method under a reactive gas atmosphere with addition of a small amount of methane (CH4) and successfully synthesized a new type of endohedral clusterfullerene entrapping a five-atom Sc3CH cluster inside a C80 cage, which was separated by two-step HPLC running on the linear combination of two Buckyprep columns. The synthesized Sc3CH@C80 hydrocarbide clusterfullerene (HCCF) represents the first endohedral clusterfullerene involving binary non-metal atoms within the fullerene cage, and thus opens up a new branch in the endohedral clusterfullerene family. Besides, the successful synthesis Sc3CH@C80 proves the applicability and potential of the “reactive gas atmosphere” route in the synthesis of new endohedral clusterfullerenes, which was initially developed for the synthesis of NCFs as discussed above.22
Following a similar strategy, in 2014 Wang and coworkers introduced a portion of H2 into the fullerene generator during vaporization of graphite rods containing a mixture of Sc/Ni2 alloy and graphite powder, and isolated a new HCCF, Sc4C2H@C80, which was found to coexist with the Sc4C2@Ih-C80 CCF. Interestingly, implanting the H-atom realized the electron-spin excitation rendering the paramagnetism of Sc4C2H@C80.170
2.8. Metal carbonitride clusterfullerenes (CNCFs)
The compound Sc3NC81 was first detected in the mass spectrum by Dorn et al.171 Later on, it was predicted by theory that this species tends to take the form of Sc3CN@C80.171 The definite experimental confirmation of such a novel endohedral clusterfullerene Sc3CN@C80, named as a metal carbonitride clusterfullerene (CNCF), was not achieved until 2010. Wang and coworkers applied the TNT technique by introducing a small portion of N2 into the Krätschmer–Huffman generator where the core-drilled graphite rod containing a mixture of Sc/Ni2 alloy was vaporized. Separation of Sc3CN@C80 was fulfilled on the basis of multi-step HPLC. Unlike another quinary cluster-based Sc3CH@C80 HCCF in which the Sc3CH is slightly pyramidal according to DFT computations, the Sc3CN cluster within Sc3CN@C80 is planar as confirmed by X-ray crystallography.23 Besides, since the [NC] moiety is proposed to be in a trianion state, which is dramatically different to the [NC]− state found in MNC@C2n CYCFs and in the traditional inorganic metal cyanide compounds or cyano coordination complexes, the Sc3CN@C80 CNCF is not categorized as a CYCF. More recently, Sc3CN@C78 was also synthesized via the same route and separated via multi-step HPLC by the same group.172 Another CNCF, Sc3NC@C68, was also predicted by Chen et al., which exhibits the non-IPR C68 (D3:6140) cage found in the Sc3N@C68 NCF.171
In 2014, Wang and coworkers synthesized and isolated a CNCF-analog hybridized with carbide—Sc3(μ3-C2)(μ3-CN)@Ih-C80. Distinct from all endohedral clusterfullerenes entrapping a single type of cluster discussed above, the septenary Sc3(μ3-C2)(μ3-CN) cluster possesses both carbide and cyanide moieties which are located on both sides of the Sc3 triangle and coordinated to three Sc atoms according to DFT computations. Interestingly, for the DFT-predicted electronic structure of (Sc3+)3(C2)2−(CN)−@(Ih-C80)6−, the [NC]− moiety is different to that within Sc3CN@C80 CNCF but similar to that found in MNC@C2n CYCFs, while the (C2)2− divalent anion is similar to those in CCFs.173 The successful isolation of Sc3(μ3-C2)(μ3-CN)@Ih-C80 demonstrates the possibility of entrapping pluralistic non-metal moieties into the fullerene cage, and this will stimulate further searches for novel endohedral clusterfullerenes.
2.9. Expectant actinide-based endohedral clusterfullerenes
To date, endohedral clusterfullerenes have been primarily based on rare earth metals and two transition metals (Ti and V). Except for a few main-group metals such as group-2 (Ca, Sr, and Ba) and group-1 (Li, Na, and K) metals, the metals able to form endohedral clusterfullerenes cover most metals which can form conventional metallofullerenes as well.4 To the best of our knowledge, an exception is the actinide metals. A few actinides, especially uranium (U), have been found to form conventional metallofullerenes although most of them were only observed in the mass spectrum without successful isolation. In early 1992, Smalley and coworkers used the laser vaporization method and detected a series of U-containing metallofullerenes such as U@C2n (2n = 28–72) and U2@C2n (2n = 50–60) for the first time.174 The second trial was conducted by Diener et al. in 1997, leading to detection of U@C74 and U@C82.175 In 2001, Akiyama et al. successfully synthesized and isolated two kinds of U-containing metallofullerenes U@C82 and U2@C80 using the DC arc-discharge method.176 Substituting U by neptunium (Np) or americium (Am) gives rise to the formation of other actinide-based metallofullerenes including M@C82 (M = Np, Am) and M2@C80 (M = Np, Am).176 In 2012, Kroto and coworkers found that C28 could be stabilized by U atoms, which showed the highest abundance in the process of laser vaporization.177 Very recently, for the first time Chen and coworkers succeeded in isolating a thorium (Th)-based metallofullerene, Th@C3v(8)-C82, and determining its single crystal structure. The electronic and spectroscopic properties of Th@C3v(8)-C82 were found to be dramatically different from those of lanthanide-based metallofullerenes, resulting in an unprecedented four electron transfer from the metal to the cage.178
To date actinide-based endohedral clusterfullerenes have never been reported although actinide belongs to the group-3 metals like the lanthanide metals. Interestingly, a recent work by Pereira et al. indicated that uranium (U) could form carbide cluster cations, such as UC2+, UC4+, UC6+ and so on, in the gas phase.179 A similar case was found for thorium as well.179,180 These findings provide an encouraging clue for the possibility of formation of U/Th-based endohedral clusterfullerenes, especially CCFs. Additionally, it is generally known that the U metal usually exhibits 3+ or 4+ valence state in the fullerene cage as revealed by several experimental and theoretical studies. Given that the 3+ valence state of the entrapped metal ion is always required for NCFs, it seems possible for the U metal to form NCFs in principle. Based on the different elemental properties between actinide and lanthanide metals, the derived endohedral (cluster)fullerenes are particularly important in terms of their special physicochemical properties different from the known lanthanide-based ones. We expect that endohedral clusterfullerenes based on actinide metals, especially U, will be synthesized and even separated in the foreseeable future.
3. Molecular structures of endohedral clusterfullerenes
3.1. The geometric structures of the entrapped metal clusters
For endohedral clusterfullerenes with variable types of entrapped metal clusters, the geometric structure of the inner metal cluster plays a key role in determining its interaction with the outer fullerene cage and consequently the stability of the entire molecule.3–5,12,13,40,41,43,181 Since the metal cluster is shielded by the outer fullerene cage, it becomes inaccessible by the conventional spectroscopic characterizations, thus so far single-crystal X-ray diffraction crystallography is the only and the most reliable method to characterize the geometric structure of the inner metal cluster within endohedral clusterfullerenes.3–5,40,182 Note that, however, since the spherical (endohedral) fullerene molecules tend to rotate randomly within the crystal lattice even at low temperatures, the single crystals obtained directly from the pristine (endohedral) fullerenes are not suitable for single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis.183,184 This obstacle has been cleared since the late 1990s by the development of two solutions: one is to use the cocrystallization technique, by which the rotation of (endohedral) fullerene molecules within the crystal lattice can be impeded by cocrystallizing agents such as Ni(II)- or Co(II)-OEP (OEP = 2,3,7,8,12,13,17,18-octaethylporphyrin dianion),11,185 and the other is to hinder the rotation of (endohedral) fullerene molecules in the crystals via covalent grafting of various functional groups onto the fullerene cage, i.e., the chemical derivatization method.121,186,187 Despite the fact that positional disorder of both the inner metal cluster and the outer fullerene cage may still exist in most cases, the molecular structures of endohedral clusterfullerenes especially the inner metal clusters have been extensively determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction crystallography during the past decade, typically depicted on the basis of the major sites with dominant occupancies.5 In addition, metal nuclei (such as 45Sc) NMR spectroscopy may help further to obtain information about the motional behavior of the entrapped metal.

3.1.1. Metal nitride clusters. 
For NCFs, tremendous work has revealed that the inner metal nitride clusters have different geometric structures, which are sensitively dependent on the sizes of the metal ions, even within the same fullerene cage.3,5,12,13,42 For instance, for the most common and representative Ih-C80 cage, X-ray crystallographic studies of a series of homogenous NCFs (M3N@Ih-C80) revealed that the small-sized nitride clusters such as Sc3N,11 Lu3N75 and Dy3N188 always exhibited the planar structure, however, upon increasing the cluster size by entrapping group-3 metals with a larger ionic radius such as Y,59 Tb69 or Gd,189 a pyramidal structure of M3N was gradually adopted. For Y3N@C80, a slightly pyramidal structure of the Y3N cluster with the central N atom displacing 0.13 Å out of the Y3 plane was observed.13 Such a pyramidal M3N structure becomes even more obvious in Gd3N@C80, within which the Gd3N cluster was found to be pyramidal with the N atom displacing ca. 0.5 Å out of the Gd3 plane as unveiled by X-ray crystallographic analysis.189 The difference in the geometric structures of the inner metal nitride clusters within M3N@C80 (M = Sc, Lu, Dy, Y, Tb, Gd) is interpreted by their different extent of suffered suppression within a limited space of the Ih-C80 cage.3,12,13 Furthermore, upon replacing one or two Gd atom(s) of the pyramidal Gd3N cluster by Sc atom(s), the resulting GdxSc3−xN cluster within GdxSc3−xN@C80 MMNCFs turns into a planar structure again.84,98,99 This can be readily understood because the introduction of the smaller Sc atom(s) makes the GdxSc3−xN cluster size smaller so that it is more preferable to be accommodated by the Ih-C80 cage as a planar structure.84 As a result, the metal nitride clusters based on small rare earth metals can be held comfortably in a relatively small-sized fullerene cage, while those based on relatively large-sized metals preferentially take pyramidal configurations as a result of the compression brought about by the finite space of the fullerene cage.57,69,118,190 The inner cluster structure of more recently reported MMNCF—Lu2CeN@C80 was also found to be pyramidal with the central N atom deviating 0.349 Å from the Lu2Ce plane. This can be explained by considering the larger ionic radii of Ce3+ (1.03 Å) and Lu3+ (0.85 Å) within Lu2CeN compared to Gd3+ (0.94 Å) and Sc3+ (0.75 Å) within Sc2GdN respectively. Interestingly, such a deviation in the central nitrogen atom is slightly smaller than that reported in Gd3N@C80 as mentioned above, even though Ce is much larger than Gd. However the introduction of two smaller metals Lu within Lu2CeN, which results in the release of intramolecular strain, accounts for this smaller deviation.
Another straightforward way to avoid the excessive compression on the large-sized metal nitride cluster within a limited space of the fullerene cage is to enlarge the fullerene cage. As revealed in earlier studies, NCFs based on lanthanide metals from Lu to Gd always display cage size distributions ranging from C68 to C98 with a preferential template of the C80 cage.59,69,75,182,189 An abrupt change happens when neodymium (Nd) with a larger ionic radius than Gd is entrapped: the cage size distribution of Nd3N@C2n is extended to C80–C98 according to the mass spectroscopic results, and the C88 cage turns into the most abundant cage for Nd-NCFs instead of the C80 cage as a template for M3N@C2n (M = Gd–Lu).191 The reason is that the Nd3N cluster with a large size is more preferable for accommodation in the larger fullerene cage. A similar trend has also been observed in Pr3N@C2n and Ce3N@C2n by Echegoyen et al., for which the largest cage was even extended to C104 and C106, respectively.96 Moreover, a stepwise and significant yield rise of M3N@C96 was detected as well, implying a progressive transition to C96 as a new template.106 Moreover, in the case of La, the largest lanthanide metal to be entrapped, the cage size distribution of La3N@C2n ranged from C86 to C110 and the La3N unit was preferentially entrapped inside the larger C96 cage.15 Therefore, in a fullerene cage with a suitable space, the inner metal nitride cluster preferentially tends to exhibit planar configuration, but, upon gradually increasing the cluster size, it is subject to varying extents of stress stemming from the finite cage space and thus transits to the pyramidal structure.12,13 However, further increasing the metal nitride cluster size might cause too much stress intolerable for the pyramidal configuration, thus a relatively larger fullerene cage is more preferred.12,13


3.1.2. Metal carbide clusters. 
Like the metal nitride clusters within NCFs, the structures of metal carbide clusters within CCFs also show some diversity. For the dimetallic carbide clusters (M2C2), the so-called butterfly shape is the general structure (see Fig. 5), which has been observed in a series of CCFs including Sc2C2@C72,127 Sc2C2@C74,192 Sc2C2@C80,123 Sc2C2@C82,193 Sc2C2@C84,16 Dy2C2@C82,143 Tb2C2@C82 (see Fig. 6a),146 Er2C2@C82130 and Gd2C2@C92.132 However, such a typical butterfly geometry is not unchangeable and expected to be dependent on the cage size of CCFs as proposed by Dorn and coworkers, who isolated and characterized a series of Y-based CCFs using 13C NMR spectroscopy coupled with DFT calculations.134 The general bent butterfly structure of the Y2C2 unit was suggested for both Y2C2@C82 and Y2C2@C84 CCFs. Upon expanding the cage size to C92, a nearly planar structure of Y2C2 was preferred, which is apparently different to the folded butterfly geometry within Y2C2@C2n (2n = 82, 84), indicating the weakened nanoscale fullerene compression within a larger cage. Furthermore, the authors proposed that a linear YCCY cluster structure was feasible for the Y2C2@C2n CCFs with a cage size beyond C100 or possessing an unusual shape according to DFT computational results (see Fig. 5).134 The structure transition of the M2C2 unit from the folded butterfly geometry to a planar configuration and eventual to a linear structure (YCCY) is consistent with more recent DFT calculation results by Popov and coworkers. Such an intriguing structural transformation process was experimentally confirmed in a series of Sc-based CCFs by Echegoyen and coworkers.129 Previous studies revealed the folded butterfly structure of the Sc2C2 cluster in Sc2C2@C2n (2n = 72, 74, 80–84). Interestingly, for the recently isolated Sc2C2@C86 CCF,128 a planar and twisted geometry of the Sc2C2 unit was adopted as revealed by the X-ray crystallographic study, within which one of the Sc atoms bonded to both carbide carbon atoms but the other one approached only one side of the carbon atoms (see Fig. 6b), suggesting a progressive stretching process.120,194 The stretching sign of Sc2C2 species becomes more evident when the carbon cage is further enlarged to C88.129 X-ray crystallographic results unambiguously assigned the structure of both the carbon cage and inner Sc2C2 cluster of Sc2C2@C88, where a zigzag geometry of the Sc2C2 unit inside an unprecedented Cs(hept)-C88 carbon cage was observed (see Fig. 6c). The evolution of the metal carbide cluster structure from the butterfly shape to a planar configuration and finally to a zigzag structure with increase of the carbon cage indicates that the restrictive effect of the carbon cage is more and more weak. Accordingly, the ideal linear structure of the metal carbide cluster can be expected within even larger cages such as C92, C94 or beyond ultimately.147–149

For Sc3C2@Ih-C80 as the only trimetallic CCF with a molecular structure determined unambiguously using X-ray crystallography, the entrapped five-atom carbide cluster Sc3C2 takes a “bat ray” form with the C2-line deviating from the Sc3 plane by 7.2° in the pristine Sc3C2@Ih-C80 CCF according to the crystallographic results of a Sc3C2@Ih-C80·Ni(OEP) cocrystal.17,150,195 However, in a singly bonded adduct Sc3C2@Ih-C80(CH2C6H5), the 3-fold disordered Sc3C2 cluster was revealed by Lu et al. to adopt two different configurations, including the “bat ray” structure and the “trifoliate” form. These results indicate that the metal carbide cluster configuration in CCFs is tunable by exohedral modification.196
Upon increasing further the number of entrapped metals, the Sc4C2 cluster within the only isolated tetrametallic CCF, Sc4C2@C80, was proposed by Wang et al. to exhibit an unprecedented Russian-doll nesting structure according to the FTIR and Raman spectroscopic study in combination with DFT calculations,151 which is yet to be confirmed experimentally.
For the special CCF, Lu2TiC@C80, in which only one carbon atom is entrapped, the Lu2TiC features a μ3-carbido ligand and titanium–carbon double bond as determined definitively by the crystallographic study (see Fig. 6d). Such a titanium–carbon double bond is obviously different from those of MxC2 within the typical CCFs, within which the metal ions form single bonds with the two carbon atoms.152 Moreover, within the Lu2TiC cluster, each metal atom interacts differently with the carbon cage, and that for Ti is particularly strong, which can be deduced from the shorter cage contacts compared to that for Lu ions.152 More recently, a similar TiC double bond was also observed in Sc2TiC@C80 as revealed by the crystallographic study.153 This unique configuration changes significantly for the congener TiDy2C2@C80, for which the TiDy2C2 cluster was predicted by DFT calculations to exhibit two conformations with similar energies: the first as the most stable one is that the C2 unit is perpendicular to the TiDy2 plane and has μ2-coordination with all metal atoms, while in the second one (9 kJ mol−1 higher in energy) the C2 fragment is tilted out of the TiDy2 plane and has μ2-coordination with Ti and one Dy atom but μ1-coordination with another Dy atom.26


3.1.3. Metal oxide clusters. 
For Sc4O2@Ih-C80 as the first OCF with a molecular structure unambiguously determined by X-ray crystallography, the entrapped Sc4O2 cluster exhibits a distorted tetrahedral set of scandium atoms with bridging oxygen atoms asymmetrically positioned on two of the triangular faces of the Sc4 tetrahedron, and the Sc–O distances are within the range of Sc–O bond lengths (1.87–2.29 Å) observed for other scandium complexes containing a bridging oxide group.19 Later, Sc4O3@Ih-C80 and Sc2O@Cs(6)-C82 were structurally characterized by X-ray crystallography as well.154,155 The Sc4O3 unit within Sc4O3@Ih-C80 consists of a nearly tetrahedral array of four scandium atoms with three oxygen atoms bridging three of the four faces of the tetrahedron, and both the Sc–Sc and Sc–O distances are similar to those in Sc4O2@Ih-C80.154 As a simpler dimetallicoxide cluster, the Sc2O cluster within Sc2O@Cs(6)-C82 takes a V-shape geometry with the Sc–O–Sc angle being 156.6(3)°. Interestingly, the V-shape geometry of the Sc2O cluster can change slightly upon changing the isomeric cage structure from Cs(6)-C82 to C3v(8)-C82, as evidenced by the slightly smaller Sc–O–Sc angle (131.0–148.9°) within the more recently isolated Sc2O@C3v(8)-C82 isomer (see Fig. 7a).156,163 This suggests that the outer fullerene cage may affect the shape of the inner metal oxide cluster.

Except for Sc2O@C3v(8)-C82, recently Feng and coworkers succeeded in isolating a series of Sc2O@C2n (2n = 70, 76, 78, 80) OCFs, enabling a direct comparison of the geometric structures of the entrapped Sc2O cluster.157–161 With the C2v(5)-C80 cage, in addition to discrepancy in the Sc–O distance, the Sc–O–Sc angle is 160.79(18)° (see Fig. 7b), which is larger than that detected in analogous C82-based OCFs, Sc2O@Cs(6)-C82 and Sc2O@C3v(8)-C82. When the cage size decreases further to C76, the Sc–O–Sc angle of the Sc2O cluster within Sc2O@Td(19151)-C76 decreases to 133.9(4)° despite the fact that the Sc–O distances are almost equal to those within Sc2O@Cs(6)-C82 (see Fig. 7c). This phenomenon was explained by the compressing effect of the smaller fullerene cage of C76.159 The smallest cage of this series is C70, which is a non-IPR cage bearing two pairs of adjacent pentagons. Expectedly, in this case the Sc–O–Sc angle within Sc2O@C2(7892)-C70 decreases further to 131.24° (see Fig. 7d). These systematic studies reveal that the Sc2O cluster within OCFs is highly flexible and may change its geometry, especially the Sc–O–Sc angle, upon varying the size and shape of the fullerene cage.


3.1.4. Metal sulfide clusters. 
So far a few SCFs have been isolated and characterized, and all are based on dimetallic sulfide clusters.20,164–168 Given that the molecular formulae of dimetallic SCFs (M2S@C2n) are quite similar to those of dimetallic OCFs (M2O@C2n), a similar V-shape geometric structure of the entrapped M2S cluster can be expected, while whether its dependence on the outer fullerene cage follows a similar trend for OCFs needs a careful check. For the first isolated SCF, Sc2S@C82, the geometric structure of the entrapped Sc2S cluster was found to depend sensitively on the isomeric cage structure, as evidenced by the difference in the Sc–S–Sc angle within Sc2S@Cs(6)-C82 and Sc2S@C3v(8)-C82, which is 113.84(3)° and 97.34(13)°, respectively.20,164,165 Later on, Sc2S@Cs(10528)-C72 with a much smaller cage was successfully isolated and characterized by X-ray crystallography by Echegoyen et al., and surprisingly its determined Sc–S–Sc angle (125.36(14)°, see Fig. 7e) is even larger than those within Sc2S@Cs(6)-C82 and Sc2S@C3v(8)-C82. This result is apparently different to the trend observed for OCFs, and was interpreted by the stronger interaction between the Sc atoms and their corresponding pentalene units (i.e., two fused pentagons) and the location of these units in the C72 cage.167 More recently, an analogous non-IPR OCF, Sc2S@C70, was isolated by the same group. Despite the lack of X-ray crystallographic data, DFT theoretical calculations predicted that the Sc–S–Sc angle was 97.8° (see Fig. 7f), smaller than those for Sc2S@Cs(6)-C82 and Sc2S@Cs(10528)-C72 but comparable to that found for Sc2S@C3v(8)-C82 (∼97°).166 Therefore, it can be concluded that the Sc2S cluster within SCFs may also change its geometry, especially the Sc–S–Sc angle, upon varying the size and isomeric structure of the fullerene cage, while its dependence seems different to the case of OCFs.
As the only SCF based on a non-group-3 metal, Ti2S@C78 isolated by Echegoyen et al. recently is unique in terms of the formal six-electron transfer from the Ti2S cluster to the C78 cage, which is different from the four-electron transfer for group-3 metal-based SCFs. Although the actual molecular structure of Ti2S@C78 is yet to be determined by X-ray crystallography, according to the DFT-optimized structure the Ti2S cluster within the D3h(24109)-C78 cage is almost linear with the Ti–S–Ti angle reaching 172° (see Fig. 7g), which is dramatically larger than that of the Sc2S cluster within Sc–SCFs.168


3.1.5. Metal cyanide clusters. 
As the first monometallic clusterfullerene, CYCF is unique among all endohedral clusterfullerenes known so far and represents the only one with the fullerene cage entrapping only one metal, which is coordinated with a [NC]− moiety. The three-atom nature makes the geometric structure of the metal cyanide cluster seemingly less complicated than those within the multimetallic clusterfullerenes such as NCFs and CCFs, however, different to the cases of other three-atom metal clusters such as M2O oxide and M2S sulfide clusters discussed above for which only one non-metal atom is involved and typically centered within the cage,21 the MNC cyanide cluster has two non-metal atoms which can both coordinate with the metal, thus the situation is far more complicated than the oxide/sulfide clusters. For the first CYCF separated by our group, YNC@Cs(6)-C82, X-ray crystallographic results revealed that the YNC cluster was triangular, with N/C atoms located near the cage center while the Y metal located between the [NC] unit and one side of the cage (see Fig. 8a). Such a triangular configuration of the YNC cluster is quite different from the linear structures commonly found in traditional metal cyanide complexes. Besides, the determined N–C bond length (0.935Å) was found to be smaller than that of the C–N triplet bonds in traditional inorganic metal cyanide compounds or cyano coordination complexes and nitrile compounds. Such a shrinking phenomenon of the N–C bond was tentatively interpreted as due to the stronger bonding between Y and C/N atoms due to the space confinement of the interior of the carbon cage.21

Later, analogous CYCYs based on terbium (Tb), three isomers of TbNC@C82, which have similar and different isomeric cage structures (C2(5), Cs(6), C2v(9)) to that of YNC@Cs(6)-C82, were successively separated by our group. Not surprisingly, the TbNC clusters within TbNC@C82 (C2(5), Cs(6), C2v(9)) all take the triangular configurations like that of YNC within YNC@Cs(6)-C82. However, a closer check of the geometric structures of these TbNC clusters reveals that, when the cage isomeric structure changes from C2(5), to Cs(6) to C2v(9), the distance of the shorter Tb–C(N)/Tb–N(C) bond decreases dramatically from 2.32(3), to 2.10(2) to 1.98(4) Å, whereas that of the longer Tb–N(C)/Tb–C(N) bond changes from 2.36(5), to 2.217(16) to 2.37(3) Å. Besides, the N–C bond length increases gradually from 0.94(5), to 1.02(3) to 1.05(4) Å when the cage isomeric structure of TbNC@C82 changes from C2(5), to Cs(6) to C2v(9). As a result, the triangular TbNC cluster exhibits obvious distortions with the Tb–C(N)–N(C) angle varying by up to 20° (see Fig. 8b–d). This suggests that the geometric structure of the entrapped TbNC cluster is dictated by the fullerene cage.27,169 This phenomenon is somewhat similar to the cases of metal oxide/sulfide clusters discussed above, but the distortion extent of the TbNC cyanide cluster is much more severe in terms of the obvious changes of the Tb–N/Tb–C bond distances, indicating the uniqueness of CYCF compared to other endohedral clusterfullerenes.
With the more recent successful separation of MNC@C2v(19138)-C76 (M = Tb, Y) as the first non-IPR monometallic clusterfullerene, the dependence of the geometric structure of the entrapped MNC cyanide cluster on the outer fullerene cage is confirmed further. Interestingly, within the same non-IPR C2v(19138)-C76 cage, both TbNC and YNC clusters take nearly linear (V-shaped) configurations with the M–N–C bond angle being 154.9(13)° and 160.4(7)° for Tb and Y, respectively (see Fig. 9n–p). This is dramatically different to the triangular geometries of the MNC cluster within the IPR-obeying C82 cages (C2(5), Cs(6), C2v(9)) discussed above.28 Such an abrupt distortion of the MNC cluster within non-IPR MNC@C76 is plausibly explained by the stronger metal–cage interaction, which is required to stabilize the fused-pentagon of the non-IPR C76 cage, leading to the weakening of the coordination bonding between the metal atom and [NC]− ligand.28 In light of the large variety of geometric structures of metal cyanide clusters demonstrated for these limited CYCFs, it remains an open question whether a completely linear MNC configuration can form within the fullerene cage.

3.1.6. Metal hydrocarbide and carbonitride clusters. 
As the first endohedral clusterfullerene involving binary non-metal atoms within the fullerene cage, Sc3CH@C80 HCCF was synthesized and isolated in 2007 by Dunsch et al., but its unambiguous structural determination is not available yet. According to DFT calculations, the geometry of the Sc3CH hydrocarbide cluster is very similar to that of the Sc3N cluster within Sc3N@C80, but, different to the planar Sc3N cluster, the Sc3CH cluster is slightly pyramidal (with pyramid height 0.25 Å, see Fig. 8e) and the Sc–C bonds are somewhat longer than the Sc–N bonds within Sc3N@C80.22 More recently, based on 1H, 13C, and 45Sc NMR spectroscopic characterization, Popov et al. determined that the chemical shift of the entrapped proton atom was −11.73 and −8.79 ppm within the Ih- and D5h-C80 cage isomers,195 however this is still unable to provide definite information on the real geometric structure of the Sc3CH cluster. A similar case was reported for the more recently separated Sc4C2H@C80 HCCF. Within the entrapped Sc4C2H cluster, four Sc atoms form a tetrahedron embracing the C2 unit, and the bonded H to C2 unit forms a hydrocarbon moiety according to DFT calculations (see Fig. 8f).170
As another quinary cluster-based endohedral clusterfullerene, the Sc3NC@C80 CNCF separated by Wang et al. shows distinct difference in the entrapped quinary cluster. Unlike the slightly pyramidal Sc3CH cluster within the Sc3CH@C80 HCCF, the Sc3NC cluster within the Sc3NC@C80 CNCF is planar as confirmed by X-ray crystallography, and the N atom is located in the center of the Sc3NC cluster while the C atom resides on one side of the triangle formed by the three Sc atoms (see Fig. 8g).23 Noteworthily, the determined N–C bond length within Sc3NC@C80 (1.193 Å) is much larger than that within the YNC@Cs(6)-C82 CYCF (0.935 Å) discussed above,22,28 revealing the difference in the bonding nature of the [NC] moiety between the CYCF and CNCF. Such a planar structure of the Sc3NC cluster is expected to be maintained in the smaller C78 cage. According to the DFT-optimized structure of Sc3NC@C78 separated by the same group later, the inner space of the C2–C78 cage is still sufficient to accommodate the planar Sc3NC cluster.172
For the septenary Sc3(μ3-C2)(μ3-CN) cluster within the CNCF-analog Sc3(μ3-C2)(μ3-CN)@Ih-C80 separated by Wang and coworkers, the entrapped C2 and CN moieties are located on both sides of the Sc3 triangle and coordinated to three Sc atoms (see Fig. 8h), respectively, according to DFT calculations. Within this complicated carbide/cyanide alloyed cluster, the Sc–C (cyanide) distance is 2.27 Å, which is longer than those of Sc–N (cyanide) (2.21 and 2.23 Å) and those within Sc3CN@Ih-C80. On the other hand, the Sc–C (carbide) distances are 2.20 and 2.35 Å, which are much longer than the Sc–C (carbide) distances in Sc4C2@Ih-C80 CCF (the nearest one is 1.96 Å).173

3.2. The structures of outer fullerene cages
Unlike the inner metal cluster whose geometric structure can only be characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction crystallography due to shielding of the outer fullerene cage, the outer fullerene cage of endohedral clusterfullerene is readily accessible like the empty fullerene by the conventional spectroscopic characterizations, thus several structural characterization methods except for single-crystal X-ray diffraction crystallography have been developed. As a commonly used method, 13C NMR spectroscopy provides valuable information on the isomeric cage structures of endohedral clusterfullerenes despite the requirement of the relatively large amounts of isomerically pure samples.3–6,17,21,102 Even for the paramagnetic endohedral clusterfullerenes, 13C NMR spectroscopy can be still applied as a useful tool for structural characterization based on their diamagnetic reduced or oxidized forms.86,101,197 Another useful method is vibrational spectroscopy, especially infrared (IR) spectroscopy, due to its high structural sensitivity and higher time resolution compared to NMR spectroscopy. Note that, however, since vibrational spectroscopy does not provide direct structural information, it is frequently supplemented by DFT calculations on modeling the spectra of several possible structural isomers so as to match the experimental spectra.3–6,12,13 The detailed discussions on the structures of the outer fullerene cages of endohedral clusterfullerenes have been summarized in several recent reviews;3–6,12,13 in this section we focus on summarizing the unconventional fullerene cages mainly reported after 2013, including the non-IPR and heptagon-containing endohedral clusterfullerenes.

3.2.1. The non-IPR endohedral clusterfullerenes. 
Usually, all empty fullerenes and most endohedral fullerenes based on classical carbon cages composed of hexagons and pentagons only follow the IPR proposed by Kroto in the 1980s,198 which determines the stability of fullerene molecules. It is accepted that the presence of adjacent pentagon pairs (APPs) in the fullerene cage, resulting in the so-called non-IPR structure, increases the local steric strain and destabilizes the π-system of the carbon cage, and eventually leads to the instability of the entire fullerene molecule.199 Theoretical results pointed out that the appearance of every APP led to the destabilization energy of 19–24 kcal mol−1.200 Upon encapsulation of metal(s) or a metal cluster within the fullerene cage, the local steric strain raised from APP can be effectively released, giving rise to the stabilization of non-IPR endohedral fullerenes.
In 2000, two non-IPR endohedral fullerenes Sc2@C66 and Sc3N@C68 were separated independently by Shinohara et al. and Dorn et al.44,201 nearly at the same time, and the latter represents the second NCF after Sc3N@C80, which has a non-IPR D3(6140)-C68 cage containing three APPs according to the X-ray crystallographic study, while the three Sc atoms are situated over the centers of pentalene portions of the fullerene cage fulfilling the stabilization of APP (see Fig. 9a).44 Meanwhile, several non-IPR MMNCFs including AxSc3−xN@C68 (x = 0–2; A = Tm, Er, Gd, Ho, La) were also synthesized in the same work, which are expected to have the same D3(6140)-C68 cage.44 From then on, a series of non-IPR NCFs including MMNCFs have been separated, including DySc2N@C68,104 LuxSc3−xN@C68 (x = 1, 2),104 Sc3N@C70 (see Fig. 9b),97 Sc2DyN@C76 (see Fig. 9c),100 M3N@C78 (M = Y,55 Gd,62 Dy,202 Tm202) (see Fig. 9d), LaSc2N@Cs(hept)-C80 (see Fig. 9e),111 M3N@C82 (M = Gd, Y) (see Fig. 9f),65 and M3N@C84 (M = Tb,71 Gd,66 Tm66) (see Fig. 9g). Although some of them have not been characterized by X-ray crystallography mainly due to the limitation of the sample amount, other spectroscopic characterizations such as 13C NMR spectroscopy and IR spectroscopy supplemented by DFT calculations revealed the non-IPR feature of their fullerene cages.55,65,97,100,104,203 Among them, the DySc2N@C76 MMNCF is somewhat interesting because its congeners Sc3N@C76 and Dy3N@C76 have not been reported yet, thus it represents the first example of a non-IPR structure stabilized by encapsulation of two different metal ions resulting in the formation of a more suitable geometry to be accommodated by the non-IPR C76 cage.100 This provides a new avenue of stabilizing the non-IPR fullerene cage via modifying the composition of the entrapped cluster through mixing metal ions with different radii. Besides, the LaSc2N@Cs(hept)-C80 MMNCF is particularly important because it is not only the first C80-based non-IPR endohedral fullerene but also represents the first heptagon-containing endohedral fullerene as discussed in detail in Section 3.2.2. In addition to NCFs, non-IPR fullerene cages have been also found for other types of endohedral clusterfullerenes, including CCFs, SCFs, OCFs, CYCFs and CNCFs. So far the separated non-IPR CCFs include Sc2C2@C68 (see Fig. 9h),125 Ti2C2@C78,139–142 Sc2C2@C72 (see Fig. 9i),127 M2C2@C84 (M = Y,134,204 Gd204) and Sc2C2@Cs(hept)-C88 (see Fig. 9j).129 Among them, Sc2C2@C68 was the first non-IPR CCF separated by Wang et al., which was characterized using 13C NMR spectroscopy revealing the existence of two APPs on the C2v(6073)-C68 cage (see Fig. 9h).125 Noteworthily, this structure was obviously different from that of Sc3N@C68 in terms of both the isomeric cage structure and the intramolecular electron transfer, revealing the influence of the inner metal cluster on the outer carbon cage. Recently, the same group synthesized and separated a new non-IPR CCF—Sc2C2@C72 (see Fig. 9i).127 X-ray crystallographic study reveals that Sc2C2@C72 bears two APPs.127 More recently, Echegoyen and coworkers synthesized and separated the first heptagon-containing CCF, Sc2C2@C88 (see Fig. 9j), which is identified as a non-IPR CCF containing one pair of APPs as discussed in detail in Section 3.2.2.129
Two non-IPR SCFs, namely, Sc2S@C70 and Sc2S@C72, have been also reported.166,167 X-ray crystallographic study indicated that Sc2S@C72 as the first non-IPR SCF possessed a Cs(10528)-C72 cage bearing two APPs, and the two Sc atom positions are nestled into the folds of the fused pentagons (see Fig. 9l). A comparative study on the structures of Sc2S@Cs(10528)-C72 with other C72-based endohedral fullerenes revealed that the shape and properties of the entrapped clusters play an important role in the selection of the non-IPR C72 cage.167 Two APPs were also observed in Sc2S@C70 separated later by the same group, which was assigned by DFT computation to have a non-IPR C2(7892)-C70 cage (see Fig. 9k). On the basis of the close structural resemblance between Sc2S@C2(7892)-C70 and Sc2S@Cs(10528)-C72, it was suggested that the conversion of these two molecules might be the result of a simple insertion of C2.166,167 Intriguingly, the same isomeric cage of C2(7892)-C70 was confirmed by the X-ray crystallographic study of Sc2O@C70 which was separated more recently by Feng et al. as the only non-IPR OCF (see Fig. 9m).158 According to a combined study of geometrical analysis and DFT computations, it was concluded that both the ionic and covalent interactions between the inner metal oxide cluster and the outer cage contributed to the stabilization of this non-IPR C70 fullerene cage.
Very recently our group successfully separated the first non-IPR CYCFs, MNC@C2v(19138)-C76 (M = Tb, Y), which represent the first non-IPR monometallic clusterfullerenes as well. One APP was observed in the X-ray crystallographic structures of MNC@C2v(19138)-C76 (M = Tb, Y), which was stabilized by the entrapped single metal (see Fig. 9n–p). As required to stabilize the APP of the non-IPR C76 cage, the metal–cage interaction is so strong that the geometric structure of the MNC cluster changes from the triangular configuration found for the IPR-obeying C82 cages to the nearly linear (V-shaped) geometry as discussed above.28
Sc3NC@C78 represents the sole non-IPR member in the CNCF family separated to date. Its isomeric cage structure was determined by vibrational spectroscopy combined with DFT calculations, revealing a C2(22010)-C78 cage with two APPs (see Fig. 9q).181 Interestingly, DFT calculations revealed that, although the size of the IPR-obeying D3h-C78 was appropriate for the Sc3N cluster, it was not large enough for entrapping the larger planar Sc3NC cluster.170


3.2.2. Heptagon-containing endohedral clusterfullerenes. 
Most separated empty and endohedral fullerenes are based on classical carbon cages, which are composed of hexagons and pentagons only.199 Earlier theoretical studies pointed out that involvement of other polygons such as heptagon on the fullerene cage usually destabilizes the fullerene molecule. Since the difference between the number of pentagons and heptagons keeps constant as twelve according to Euler’s theorem, addition of one heptagon increases the number of pentagons by one and meanwhile decreases the number of hexagons by two, and the heptagon is predicted to be fused to an APP for the most stable isomers of heptagon-containing non-classical fullerenes.205–207 While a few heptagon-containing empty fullerenes have been synthesized in the form of exohedral derivatives, a heptagon-containing endohedral fullerene had not been discovered until the successful separation and characterization of a new isomer of the LaSc2N@C80 MMNCF by Popov et al.111 Astonishingly, the X-ray crystallographic study revealed that this new isomer of LaSc2N@C80 consisted of one heptagon along with 13 pentagons and 28 hexagons, and the heptagon was fused to two APPs (see Fig. 9e). Similar to its classical isomer, LaSc2N@Ih-C80, the entrapped LaSc2N cluster is flat, and the two Sc ions are located beneath the pentalene units, thus alleviating the resultant steric strain.111 In contrast to the classical non-IPR structure, for which the APPs are always separated as large as possible in order to decrease the steric strain as proposed recently by the “maximum pentagon separation rule”, for Sc2LaN@Cs(hept)-C80 the two APPs reside opposite along the heptagon, thus not complying to this rule.111
More recently, Echegoyen et al. separated a new non-IPR CCF, Sc2C2@C88, as the second heptagon-containing endohedral clusterfullerene. Sc2C2@C88 was identified by X-ray crystallography, revealing a zigzag Sc2C2 cluster entrapped within an unprecedented Cs(hept)-C88 cage containing 1 heptagon, 13 pentagons and 32 hexagons. Although the numbers of heptagons and pentagons for Sc2C2@C88 are similar to those for Sc2LaN@Cs(hept)-C80 containing two APPs, there is only one APP fusing the sole heptagon for Sc2C2@C88 (see Fig. 6c), and this is obviously due to their difference in the number of hexagons.129 Despite these two rare reports, such intriguing molecular structures are anticipated to stimulate further endeavors on novel heptagon-containing endohedral clusterfullerenes.

3.3. The interplay between the metal cluster and fullerene cage
A systematic comparison of the reported empty and endohedral fullerenes demonstrates that the isomeric cage structures of the separated endohedral clusterfullerenes are often different from those of separated empty fullerenes. This can be explained by the particular stability of endohedral clusterfullerenes resulting from the exclusive interplay between the inner metal cluster and outer carbon cage.3–5,12,13,40,41,43,181 For example, for Sc3N@C80 NCFs, the isomeric form (Ih or D5h) of the C80 cage stabilized by the nitride cluster has not been isolated as the empty fullerene. On the other hand, the entrapped Sc3N cluster stabilized by the fullerene cage is unstable as a single species. Therefore, the NCF structure fulfils the mutual stabilization of the inner metal nitride cluster and outer fullerene cage with a specific isomeric structure. Compared to the conventional metallofullerenes, the involvement of non-metal atom(s) within the entrapped metal cluster yields the intracluster interactions, making metal–cage interactions within endohedral clusterfullerenes more complicated. The intracluster interaction is generally regarded as the ionic bonding between the positively charged metal ions with the negatively charged non-metal ions such as N3−, C22−, O2−, and S2−, and is determined by the composition and the geometric structure of the metal cluster as discussed in detail in Section 3.1. In this section we focus on the discussion on the cluster–cage interactions within endohedral clusterfullerenes.
According to the ionic model proposed initially for monometallofullerenes such as La3+@C823−, metal–cage interactions within endohedral clusterfullerenes can be fulfilled by electron transfer from the entrapped metal cluster to the outer carbon cage. Generally, a certain number of electrons dependent on the composition of the metal cluster are transferred from metal atom(s) to the non-metal atom(s) to form the necessary metal cluster and the extra electrons will be delivered to the fullerene cage, hence the relative stability of the isomeric structure of the fullerene cage will be altered according to its charge states.5 For instance, the most common Ih(7)-C80 isomer shows the highest stability in the form of the −6 charge state, which progressively turns out to be unstable in the 0 or −2 charge states.171 This agrees well with the fact that the Ih isomer of the C80 empty fullerene has not been separated experimentally yet.208 For NCFs, a 6-fold electron transfer from the (M3+)3N3− cluster to the fullerene cage can be conceived, resulting in a M3N6+@C2n6− ionic model.15 In view of this simple model, Poblet and coworkers developed a stability criterion of NCF that the most suitable cage isomers capable of entrapping metal nitride clusters are those with a considerably large gap between LUMO+3 and LUMO+4, which will evolve into the HOMO and LUMO orbitals of the C2n6− hexaanion when the electrons transfer from the entrapped cluster to the carbon cage.14 By employing this criterion, they found that only C60, D3h(5)-C78 and C80 (Ih & D5h) were the most appropriate candidates for accommodating metal nitride clusters among 51 possible IPR isomers from C60 to C84. This is in good accordance with the experimental results regardless of the C60, which was indeed too small to host a metal nitride cluster. This criterion is also applicable for the larger NCFs in the C86–C100 range since the proposed preferential candidates such as D3(19)-C86, D2(35)-C88 and D5(450)-C100 were demonstrated to exist in Tb3N@C86, M3N@C88 (M = Tb, Tm) and La2@C100 according to X-ray crystallographic studies.69,77,209,210 Thus, it is confirmed that the electron transfer from the inner metal cluster to the outer carbon cage plays a vital role in the stability of the entire NCF molecule.
In addition to NCFs, the stabilities of other types of clusterfullerenes, including CCFs, OCFs, SCFs etc., are also dependent on such a unique metal–cage interaction. Realizing the 4-fold electron transfer from the M2C2 carbide cluster to the carbon cage, the C2n4− tetranions with large HOMO–LUMO gaps are expected to exhibit higher stability. For example, the C3v(8) isomer was suggested to be the most stable C824− isomer, which is in line with the experimental results that the detected most abundant isomers of Sc2C2@C82, Y2C2@C82, Er2C2@C82 and Dy2C2@C82 CCFs are all C3v(8)-C82.121,130,133,143 Besides, the 4-fold electron transfer process can be assigned to SCFs as well; accordingly a similar result was observed in M2S@C82 (M = Sc, Y, Dy) taking C3v(8)-C82 as the most abundant isomer.20 Note that such interaction between the metal cluster and carbon cage owing to the intramolecular electron transfer not only affects the kinetic stability of the entire endohedral clusterfullerene molecule as stated above, but also has a great influence on their thermodynamic stability. The detailed studies of the thermodynamic stabilities of NCFs were conducted by Popov and coworkers.80 Based on the six-electron transfer from the metal nitride cluster to the carbon cage, the authors proposed that the stability of the NCF isomers should correlate with the stability of the fullerene cages in the hexaanionic form. By screening through a large number of isomers including both IPR and non-IPR structures with the cage ranging from C68 to C96, the authors obtained a series of the most possible isomers for each cage according to the thermodynamic stabilities of their corresponding hexaanionic fullerene cage, which were later confirmed by experimental results. For example, the most stable isomers of C2(22010)-C78, D3(63761)-C86 and D2(81738)-C88 were confirmed by the X-ray crystallographic studies of Gd3N@C78, Tb3N@C86 and M3N@C88 (M = Tb, Tm).69,77 For M3N@C84, the D2(51589)-C84 was calculated to be the most stable isomer, however the experimentally detected structures of M3N@C84 (M = Tb, Tm) turned out to be the second most stable isomer Cs(51365)-C84. This discrepancy can be explained by considering the kinetic stability as the Cs(51365)-C84 isomer (1.34 eV) has a relatively larger band-gap than D2(51589)-C84 (0.80 eV).66 A similar case was also observed for M3N@C82, and the cage structures of Gd3N@C82 and Y3N@C82 were elucidated to be Cs(39663)-C82 as the fifth most stable isomer.59,65 Interestingly, Sc3N@C82 isolated recently by our group is quite exceptional since the most stable isomer C2v(39718)-C82 was not preferred theoretically due to its quite small band-gap (0.73 eV), but was confirmed to be the actual isomeric cage structure of Sc3N@C82 based on X-ray crystallographic results.79 Besides, the resultant different isomeric cage for entrapping metal nitride clusters with different sizes was also studied in M3N@C78 (M = Sc, Gd), for which the D3h(24109)-C78 and C2(22010)-C78 isomer were determined for Sc3N@C78 and Gd3N@C78, respectively.47,62 This indicates that the size of the entrapped metal cluster is one more crucial factor that influences the isomeric cage structure since the different sizes of the entrapped cluster will bring about different strains inside the cage, which will finally result in discrepancy in the cluster–cage interaction.
Likewise, for M2C2@C2n CCFs and SCFs with intramolecular four-electron transfers, the thermodynamic stability of the corresponding tetraanionic C2n4− should be considered, but a dianionic C2n2− state should be applied to evaluate the stability of CYCF. Overall, all of these results, mainly theoretical studies, indicate that the cluster–cage interaction in terms of electron transfer is primarily responsible for the high stability of endohedral clusterfullerenes.
Based on the ionic model described above, the valence state of the entrapped metal dependent on the electron transfer from the inner metal cluster to the outer fullerene cage can provide indirect but valuable information on the cluster–cage interaction. Therefore, experimentally probing the metal–cage interactions within endohedral clusterfullerenes has been focused on the valence states of the entrapped metals measured using high-energy spectroscopies such as UV photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), valence-band photoelectron spectroscopy (VB-PES), resonant photoelectron spectroscopy (ResPES), X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), (near)-edge X-ray absorption fine-structure (NEXAFS) and electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS), and the details will be discussed in Section 4.1.
On the other hand, since the low-energy vibrational patterns in the Raman spectra of endohedral fullerenes are directly correlated with bond formation between the endohedral species and the outer fullerene cage, Raman spectroscopy has been extensively used to probe directly the cluster–cage interactions within endohedral fullerenes especially clusterfullerenes based on primarily the specific cluster–cage vibrational modes.10,12,13,64,74,91,92,188,211,212 Given that the frequencies of the cluster–cage vibration modes are defined by not only cluster–cage force constants but also the mass of the cluster, while the strength of the metal–cage bond formation is related only to the former factor (force constants), careful analysis of the vibrational frequencies by distinguishing the influence of these two factors should be made so as to obtain accurate information of the cluster–cage interactions, and quantum-chemical calculations of the force fields are usually required to supplement the assignments of the vibrational signals detected in the experimental Raman spectra.188,213 For instance, a systematic study of the low-energy Raman spectra of a series of M3N@Ih-C80 (M = Sc, Y, Gd, Tb, Ho, Er, Tm) NCFs revealed that the radial C80 cage and metal-based vibrational modes corresponded to the signals with frequencies down to 220 cm−1 and 220–30 cm−1, respectively. The latter metal-based group combines the in-plane M3N cluster deformation mode, and the frustrated translations and rotations of the M3N cluster, which are caused by the bond formation between the M3N and C80 cage.74,188 Furthermore, based on an in-depth study supplemented by DFT computations, the strong Raman lines at 210 cm−1 of Sc3N@Ih-C80, 194 cm−1 for Y3N@Ih-C80 and 157–165 cm−1 for other M3N@Ih-C80 (M = Gd, Tb, Ho, Er, Tm) NCFs can be assigned to the frustrated in-plane cluster translation partially mixed with the in-plane M3N deformation, and consequently this frequency may serve as a measure to the strength of the cluster–cage interaction within NCFs.188 Compared to other M3N@Ih-C80, the cluster–cage interaction within Sc3N@Ih-C80 is significantly weaker as reflected by its larger frequency due to the smaller ionic radius of Sc3+. Upon increasing the ionic radius of the rare earth metal, softening of the tangential mode frequencies is observed, suggesting an increase of the M3N–cage force constant and an increase of the cluster–cage interaction. However, the cluster–cage interactions do not change considerably with the further increase of the metal radius in the series of Lu–Gd lanthanide metals.3–6,12,13 These results can provide a rational interpretation to the change of the geometric structures of the entrapped M3N clusters discussed in Section 3.1.1. With the increase of the ionic radius from Sc to Gd, the resultant increase of the cluster–cage interaction leads to the increase of the “cage pressure”, thus pushing the nitrogen atom out of the M3 plane to form the pyramidalized structure.3–6,12,13,189
Raman spectroscopy has been also employed to investigate the cluster–cage interactions in addition to the supplementary assignments of the isomeric cage structures of other endohedral clusterfullerenes such as CCFs, OCFs and SCFs.20,154,193,205,214–218 In particular, the entrapped C2 moiety can be distinguished from the carbon atoms on the fullerene cage using Raman spectroscopy like 13C NMR spectroscopy with lower time resolution.219–221 For example, based on the low-energy Raman spectroscopic study of a Sc2C2@C84 CCF, Hulman et al. observed the quantized rotational states of the entrapped C2 unit, and this phenomena was described as a planar C2 rotor in a solid consisting of Sc2C84 molecules behaving as a quantum gyroscope with a cardanic suspension.214–217
3.4. Formation mechanisms of endohedral clusterfullerenes
The formation mechanisms for fullerenes have long been a bottleneck in the fullerene community. For endohedral clusterfullerenes, due to the encapsulation of multiple metal and non-metal atoms, the situation becomes even more intricate. Till now whether the formation process of endohedral fullerenes is similar to that of empty fullerenes or dependent on the entrapped species remains still an open question. For empty fullerenes, various formation mechanisms have been proposed by many groups, which can be generally divided into two paths, one is “bottom-up” and the other is the “top-down” mechanism.222–228 However, for endohedral fullerenes no mechanism has been widely accepted so far due to the lack of sufficient experimental evidence, and only few reports combining experimental results with theoretical studies were available. For instance, in 2004 Shinohara et al. claimed a “top-down” mechanism with a C2-loss process for the formation of CCFs, whereby Y2@C3v(8)-C82 and Y2C2@C3v(8)-C82 were directly formed by evaporating C2 either outward or inward of the cage from Y2@C84 at the final stage of growth.133 In 2013, Dorn, Balch and coworkers presented more solid molecular structural evidence for the “top-down mechanism” for the formation of M2C2@C1(51383)-C84 (M = Y, Gd) CCFs. The authors proposed that M2C2@C1(51383)-C84 with destabilizing fused pentagons was the starting point for the generation of a series of known high-symmetry, IPR-allowed endohedral fullerenes with smaller cages via proper C2 losses and well-defined Stone–Wales rearrangements. Such a missing link provides rational evidence to support the top-down formation of the related fullerene structures (see Fig. 10).204

On the other hand, the “bottom-up” mechanism was experimentally boosted in 2012 by Kroto and coworkers who developed a so-called “closed network growth” (CNG) process for the formation of fullerenes. When exposing fullerenes such as C60 and C70 and metallofullerene La2C80 to carbon vapor, these species tend to trap one or two carbon atoms via the CNG process to grow into large-cage fullerenes. The CNG mechanism offers an unequivocal route for the formation of fullerenes.223 Furthermore, their more recent work in 2014 disclosed that the entrapped metal atoms dominated the formation of endohedral monometallofullerenes in the “bottom-up” mechanism. Striking metal atoms dependent on the formation of fullerenes were observed by synthesis of metallofullerenes entrapping versatile metal atoms including alkali metals, alkaline earth metals and group-3 metals. M@C60 and M@C70 were demonstrated to be the dominant products when alkali metals capable of donating one single electron were entrapped. For the alkaline earth metals that could transfer two electrons, M@C50 and M@C60 were preferred. A considerable shift to even smaller monometallofullerenes M@C44 occurred for group-3 metals that could endow three electrons. The authors claimed that the charge transfer from the entrapped metal to the cage took place at the inception of metallofullerene formation. Such a charge transfer compensates the structural strain energy and makes the metallofullerene stable.229 A similar growth mechanism for small-size Ti-based metallofullernes Ti@C2n (2n = 26–50) was investigated theoretically by Poblet and coworkers in 2014, revealing that all of the most favorable metallofullerene isomers were formally linked by a simple C2 insertion or afterwards followed by a Stone–Wales transformation, and that the most abundant metallofullerene isomers were the most stable ones after four electrons were transferred from the metal to the carbon cages.230 This mechanism can well explain the growth mechanism of small-size metallofullerenes, but seems a bit feeble for large-size metallofullerenes. Given that none of these mechanisms are satisfyingly able to be applicable for all known endohedral fullerenes including clusterfullerenes, further endeavors are definitely needed to tackle this bottleneck.
4. Properties of endohedral clusterfullerenes
4.1. Electronic properties
Undoubtedly, UV-vis-NIR absorption spectroscopy has been demonstrated to be the most powerful and commonly used technique for studying the electronic properties of endohedral fullerenes due to its simplicity. In general, the electronic absorptions of endohedral fullerenes predominantly originate from π–π* transitions of the isomeric structure and the charge state of the carbon cage. As a result, for the same type of endohedral fullerenes bearing the same charge state of the carbon cage, the electronic absorption pattern is primarily dependent on the isomeric structure of the carbon cage and much less sensitive to the entrapped species. For instance, the UV-vis-NIR absorption spectra of M3N@C80 (Ih and D5h, M = Sc,11,51 Y,59,212 Tb,68,69 Dy,94,188 Tm,72–74 Lu75,231) are almost identical because the charge state of their carbon cages as well as the cage isomers are the same. A similar case can also be identified in other cage sizes (or isomers) of NCFs, which has been summarized in our previous reviews.3,5,12,13 In view of this advantage, UV-vis-NIR absorption spectroscopy may be used as a simple method to preliminarily elucidate the isomeric structure of the carbon cage of the new compounds, and the molecular structure can be ultimately determined in combination with further FTIR spectroscopic characterization and DFT calculations.20,23,61–67,72–74,76,87,101–104,112,114,170,172,173 By means of this method, the assignments of the isomeric cage structures of a series of DyxSc3−xN@C2n (x = 1, 2, 2n = 68, 70, 76–86) MMNCFs were successfully fulfilled by our group recently.112Fig. 11 presents their corresponding UV-vis-NIR absorption spectra in comparison with those of the reported Dy- and Sc-based homogeneous NCFs. Specifically, the absorption spectrum of DySc2N@C70 resembles that of Sc3N@C70, indicating their similar cage symmetry as further confirmed by the FTIR spectrum coupled with DFT computation study.97 The similarity of the absorption spectra of the two isomers of DySc2N@C78 (I, II) with those of previously reported Sc3N@D3h (24109)-C78 and Dy3N@C2(22010)-C78 shows that the isomeric structures of DySc2N@C78 (I, II) can be attributed to D3h(24109)-C78 and C2(22010)-C78, respectively.47,94,203 For DyxSc3−xN@C80 (II, x = 1, 2) with different numbers of substitutions of Dy by the Sc atom (x value), the absorption spectra are quite similar, suggesting a high resemblance of their cage isomeric structures. Besides, such absorption characters were found to be similar to those of M3N@D5h-C80 (M = Sc, Dy), thus the D5h-C80 isomer should be recognized for DyxSc3−xN@C80 (II, x = 1, 2). Surprisingly, such a similarity upon changing the number of substitutions of Dy by the Sc atom (x value) was not observed any more for cages larger than C80. As a result, the absorption spectra of Dy2ScN@C82 and DySc2N@C82 were obviously different: while the absorption spectrum of Dy2ScN@C82 was similar to that of Dy3N@Cs(39663)-C82, enabling a tentative assignment of the Cs(39663)-C82 isomeric cage structure for Dy2ScN@C82, the spectrum of DySc2N@C82 had no analogue among the reported C82-based NCFs, and the C2v(39718)-C82 isomeric cage structure, which was similar to that of our newly isolated Sc3N@C2v(39718)-C82,79 was predicted based on FTIR spectroscopic characterization combined with DFT calculations. Moreover, coincidence of the absorption spectra of DySc2N@C84 and DySc2N@C86 with those of Dy3N@C84 and Dy3N@C86, respectively, allows straightforward assignments of their cage symmetries.94

On the other hand, the optical bandgap of an endohedral fullerene can be estimated on the basis of the onset of its absorption spectrum.3,5,12,13,94 By using a value of 1.0 eV to define large- and small-bandgap endohedral fullerenes, we found that all isolated DyxSc3−xN@C2n (x = 1, 2, 2n = 68, 70, 76–86) MMNCFs, including the reported DySc2N@C68, DySc2N@C76 and DyxSc3−xN@C80 (I, Ih), are large bandgap endohedral fullerenes (except for DySc2N@C76 and Dy2ScN@C84 with optical bandgaps very close to 1.0 eV). This feature is distinctly different from that of Dy3N@C2n (2n = 78–88) NCFs, for which the small cages (2n = 78, 80, 82) possess large optical bandgaps (1.38–1.51 eV), whereas the optical bandgap of those based on larger cages (2n = 84, 86, 88) are significantly smaller (0.80–0.84 eV).94,112 These results indicate the significant influence of the entrapped mixed metal nitride on the electronic properties of MMNCFs.94 A further unique example was found for V-containing MMNCFs VxSc3−xN@Ih(7)-C80 (x = 1, 2) isolated very recently by our group. Quite different to the cases of the lanthanide metal-based MMNCFs MxSc3−xN@Ih(7)-C80, for which the absorption spectra generally exhibit small changes upon changing the composition of the entrapped MxSc3−xN cluster (i.e., x value), the UV-vis-NIR absorption spectra of V2ScN@Ih(7)-C80 and VSc2N@Ih(7)-C80 are obviously different and the deviation of their estimated optical bandgaps reaches 0.23 eV. This reveals the peculiarity of the electronic properties of group-VB transition metal V-based MMNCFs.90
In addition to NCFs, UV-vis-NIR spectroscopy remains the most important tool in the investigation of the electronic properties of CCFs. Based on a systematic comparison of the electronic absorption spectra of three isomers of Er2C2@C82 (I, II, III) CCFs with those of their Er2@C82 (I, II, III) counterparts, Shinohara and coworkers found that their corresponding absorption features were quite similar irrespective of a slight peak shift, thus concluding that these two types of endohedral fullerenes should have the same cage symmetries,130 which were identical to those of Y2C2@C82 (Cs, C2v, C3v) CCFs with isomeric cage structures elucidated by 13C NMR spectroscopy already.133 Besides, recent crystallographic study of the three isomers of Sc2C2@C82 (I, II, III) revealed the same cage symmetries with those of M2C2@C82 (M = Er, Y), hence the absorption spectra showed high resemblance with those of M2C2@C82 (M = Er, Y).17,121,122,193,232,233
Likewise, on the basis of such an empirical rule that the UV-vis-NIR absorption properties of endohedral clusterfullerenes primarily depend on the charge state and isomeric structure of the carbon cage whereas the entrapped entities have a negligible effect, UV-vis-NIR spectroscopic data can provide intuitive structural information on other types of endohedral clusterfullerenes. For example, the initial structure elucidations of two isomers of Sc2S@C82 (Cs(6), C3v(8)) SCFs were fulfilled via a comparison of their UV-vis-NIR absorption spectra with those of Sc2C2@C82, as confirmed later by crystallographic analysis.17,18,20,121,122,164,165,193,213,214 A high resemblance of the electronic structures between Sc2O@C82 (Cs(6), C3v(8)) OCFs and Sc2S@C82 (Cs(6), C3v(8)) SCFs was also revealed, coinciding well with their identity in terms of the cage symmetry as well as the charge state of the C82 cage.164,165 According to this empirical rule, changing the cage symmetry would lead to a sensitive alternation of the electronic absorption properties of an endohedral clusterfullerene. One recent example is that the UV-vis-NIR absorption spectra of two recently reported CYCFs, namely YNC@Cs(6)-C82 and TbNC@C2(5)-C82, are totally different due to their discrepancies in cage symmetry.21,169 Given that the formal charge states of the carbon cages of these two CYCFs are −2, it is no wonder that the absorption spectrum of YNC@Cs(6)-C82 was similar to that of M2+-based monometallofullerenes M@Cs(6)-C82 (I, M = Yb, Sm, Eu),234–236 while the absorption spectra of TbNC@C2(5)-C82 and M@C2(5)-C82 (II, M = Yb, Sm, Eu) highly resemble each other.237–239
4.2. Electrochemical properties
Compared with conventional metallofullerenes, the electronic properties of endohedral clusterfullerenes appear to be more intricate due to their unique molecular structures, for which both metal and non-metal ions are involved in charge transfer processes.3,5,12,13,92,211,240–244 Thanks to the sophisticated electrochemistry techniques including cyclic voltammetry and pulse voltammetry etc., direct access to the mechanisms of electron transfer within endohedral clusterfullerenes becomes feasible. Pioneered by Dunsch and coworkers, an electrochemical study of the Sc3N@Ih-C80 NCF revealed two reduction steps with formal redox potentials of −1.24 and −1.62 eV along with one oxidation step at 0.62 eV.54 Accordingly the electrochemical gap of Sc3N@Ih-C80 (1.86 eV) was estimated from the difference between the first reduction and first oxidation potentials, which is smaller than that of C60 but obviously larger than those of the majority of conventional metallofullerenes.52,54,67,115,245–248 To date, the electrochemical properties of a large number of endohedral clusterfullerenes have been reported, and Table 2 presents an exhaustive list of redox potentials of all endohedral clusterfullerenes reported to date. While detailed discussions of those endohedral clusterfullerenes reported before 2013 have been given in recent reviews,3,5,12,13 in this section we focus on new advances after 2013, emphasizing the interplay between the intrinsic electronic structures and the molecular structures of both the entrapped metal cluster and outer cage, which is conducive to a better understanding of the intriguing electrochemical properties of endohedral clusterfullerenes.

4.2.1. NCFs. 
In 2013, Dunsch and Popov et al. reported the electrochemical study of a series of Ce-based MMNCFs—CeM2N@C80 (M = Sc, Y).249 In the cathodic region, all compounds exhibited similar reduction behavior accompanied by two irreversible one-electron reduction steps with reduction potentials close to those of M3N@C80 NCFs, indicating the typical carbon cage-based reduction processes. While the observed oxidation behavior in the anodic region, with oxidation potential at −0.07 and 0.01 V, respectively, was drastically different from that of M3N@C80 NCFs, suggesting their different oxidation behavior. Such a large difference between the oxidation behavior of CeM2N@C80 and M3N@C80 was previously identified in Lu2CeN@C80, for which the endohedral CeIII instead of the carbon cage was involved in the oxidation process, resulting in obvious discrepancy of oxidation potential.197 Hence, the authors assumed that a similar situation took place in CeM2N@C80 (M = Sc, Y) with the endohedral Ce participating in the oxidation process. This assumption was confirmed by studying the electrochemical properties of PrSc2N@C80, as the analogue of CeSc2N@C80, which showed a reversible oxidation potential at 0.64 V in close similarity to M3N@C80 NCFs. A closer comparison revealed a progressive negative shift of the oxidation potential upon enlarging the size of the entrapped CeM2N cluster: the most negative E1/2 value of −0.07 V was recorded for CeY2N@C80, followed by CeLu2N@C80 at 0.01 V and CeSc2N@C80 at 0.33 V. With the help of DFT calculations, it can be interpreted, by considering different strains resulting from the second entrapped metal, that the release of the inherent strain when CeIII is oxidized to CeIV gave the nudge of the oxidation process. Thus, the stronger the strain in the pristine NCF, the easier it was to be oxidized.249 An extended study on the electrochemical properties of a series of CexM3−xN@C2n (x = 1, 2; M = Sc, Y; 2n = 78–88) MMNCFs was reported by the same group later on.109 According to the exclusive feature of apparent negative shift of the first oxidation potential and increased difference of the first and second oxidation potentials, the oxidation processes of CeSc2N@C78, CeM2N@Ih-C80 (M = Sc, Lu, Y), CeY2N@C84, Ce2YN@C86, CeY2N@C86, Ce2ScN@C86, and Ce3N@C88 were all dominated by the endohedral species (Ce). Furthermore, theoretical results revealed that the mechanism of electrochemical oxidation of Ce-based MMNCFs, in particular whether the carbon cage-based or the endohedral-manipulated process, was dependent on the cluster/cage size. Specifically, if the inherent strain was high enough to result in Ce-based oxidation, the internal Ce was preferred to oxide, otherwise the oxidation occurred on the fullerene cage.109 In another exhaustive electrochemical study of a series of Sc/Gd-based MMNCFs, ScxGd3−xN@C2n (x = 1–2, 2n = 78–88) reported by the same group, the redox of ScxGd3−xN@C2n was somewhat similar to that of their Gd3N@C2n counterparts regardless of the slight deviation of redox potentials.114
Since the electrochemical studies mentioned above are all based on MMNCFs containing group-III metals only, an intriguing question is whether the involvement of non-group-III metals would affect the electrochemical properties of MMNCFs. On the basis of the successful separation of the first non-group-III metal-based MMNCFs, TiM2N@C80 (M = Sc, Y), by our group, Yang, Popov and Dunsch et al. carried out a dedicated study on the electrochemical properties of TiM2N@C80, revealing the remarkable influence of non-group-III metal (Ti) on the electrochemical properties of the corresponding M3N@C80 NCFs: different to the electrochemically irreversible reduction steps of M3N@C80 (M = Sc, Y), substitution of one Sc/Y atom by Ti resulted in the reversible reduction steps of TiM2N@C80 (M = Sc, Y).88,89 To this end, it is worthwhile to investigate the influence of other non-group-III metals on the electrochemical properties of NCFs, and our recent successful isolation of group-V metal-based MMNCFs, VxSc3−xN@C80 (Ih, x = 1, 2), endows a further possibility.90 VSc2N@Ih(7)-C80 exhibited one electrochemically irreversible oxidation step (Ep = 0.44 V) in the anodic region, which is scarcely reported for rare earth metal-based NCFs (see Fig. 12). More strikingly, in the cathodic region, VSc2N@Ih(7)-C80 showed a complex and more unique feature with up to five reduction steps. Among them, the first four reduction steps were reversible with reduction potential at −0.42, −0.66, −1.33 and −1.71 V, respectively, while the fifth reduction step was irreversible with a peak potential at −2.32 V. As far as we are concerned, such a complex reduction behavior has never been reported in other NCFs, suggesting the peculiarity of NCFs based on the group-VB metal V. For V2ScN@Ih(7)-C80 with one more V ion being entrapped, its electrochemical behavior showed some differences with other lanthanide-based NCFs as well as VSc2N@Ih(7)-C80. Two oxidation steps were clearly observed: the first oxidation step was reversible with E1/2 at 0.60 V, which was positively shifted relative to that of VSc2N@Ih(7)-C80, and the second oxidation step appeared irreversible with Ep at 1.07 V (see Fig. 12). Unlike the VSc2N@Ih(7)-C80 with five reduction steps, only two reduction steps were detected for V2ScN@Ih(7)-C80 and the first one was irreversible with Ep at −0.77 V, whereas the second one was reversible with E1/2 at −2.38 V. Noticeably, the separation between the first and second reduction step was rather large, which has never been observed in other NCFs either, suggesting once again the peculiarity of group-VB metal V-based NCFs. Besides, the electrochemical gaps of VSc2N@Ih(7)-C80 and V2ScN@Ih(7)-C80 also showed great difference with the calculated values at 0.86 and 1.37 V, respectively. The distinct difference in the electrochemical properties between VSc2N@Ih(7)-C80 and V2ScN@Ih(7)-C80 indicates the possibility of modulating the electronic properties of VxSc3−xN@C80 upon varying the number of entrapped V atoms.90

More recently, the electrochemical properties of the first heptagon-containing NCF—LaSc2N@Cs(hept)-C80—were studied by Popov and coworkers.111 In contrast to the typical electrochemical behavior of M3N@C80 NCFs featuring a reversible oxidation step, LaSc2N@Cs(hept)-C80 exhibited two unusual irreversible oxidation steps with oxidation potentials at 0.61 and 1.04 V. These oxidation potentials were similar to those of LaSc2N@Ih-C80, whereas the reduction potentials of LaSc2N@Cs(hept)-C80 were substantially more positive than those of LaSc2N@Ih-C80, revealing the significant effect of the cage isomeric structure on the electrochemical properties of NCFs.111


4.2.2. CCFs. 
The electrochemical properties of TiLu2C@C80 were studied by Popov and coworkers in 2014. The authors stated that TiLu2C@C80 exhibited a concise electrochemical behavior, showing one reversible reduction and oxidation step at –0.91 and +0.63 V, respectively (see Fig. 13).152 The good reversibility of the redox steps is evidently different from many other reported CCFs, for which the reduction processes are always irreversible. Interestingly, the reduction step of TiLu2C@C80 is similar to that of other Ti-based endohedral fullerenes, including Ti2S@C78 and TiSc2N@C80, for which the reduction process is localized on the entrapped metal Ti,88,168 the Ti-dominated reduction step for TiLu2C@C80 can be intuitively postulated. Direct demonstration of Ti-controlled reduction was later established by the same group based on a series of Ti-based CCFs, M2TiC@Ih-C80 (M = Sc, Gd, Dy, Y) and Sc2TiC2@Ih-C80,26,153 for which the reduction potential of endohedral TiIII/TiIV was related to the size of the endohedral cluster. A gradual negative shift of the reduction potential was observed upon increasing the cluster size from Sc2TiC to Dy2(Y2)TiC and finally to Gd2TiC. A reasonable explanation of this phenomenon was that the inner strain in these CCFs emerged when the size of the cluster was non-commensurable with that of the carbon cage. The increase of the ionic radius of Ti upon reduction raised the strain energy, which appeared to be more strained for the larger cluster and hence pushed its reduction potentials to more negative values.26,88,152,153

In 2015, Echegoyen and coworkers studied the redox potential of Sc2C2@C2v(9)-C86 CCF,128 which exhibited one reversible along with three irreversible reduction steps as well as one reversible oxidation step. The electrochemical gap of Sc2C2@C2v(9)-C86 was determined to be 1.31 V. Interestingly, switching the cage from the known C2v(9)-C82 to the present C2v(9)-C86 did not cause significant changes in the reduction behavior, but prominently affected the oxidation process with a deviation of 0.22 V.128 Compared with Sc2C2@C2v(9)-C86, Sc2C2@Cs(hept)-C88 isolated very recently showed more unique electrochemical properties featuring up to five reduction steps, including four reversible and one irreversible reduction process, and one reversible oxidation step.129 This electrochemical character is evidently different from LaSc2N@Cs(hept)-C80 although both bear uncommon heptagons.111


4.2.3. OCFs. 
The electrochemical properties of a series of Sc2O@C2n (2n = 70, 76, 80, 82) OCFs have been studied systematically by Feng and Chen et al.157–163 By using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and different pulse voltammetry (DPV), they first studied the electrochemical properties of the Sc2O@C2(7892)-C70 OCF. In the anodic range, Sc2O@C2(7892)-C70 showed two reversible oxidation steps with half-wave potentials at 0.1 and 0.55 V, respectively. In contrast, two reduction steps with peak potentials of −1.36 and −1.80 V were electrochemically irreversible. A further comparison to Sc2S@C2(7892)-C70 indicated that the reduction behavior of Sc2O@C2(7892)-C70 resembled that of the Sc2S@C2(7892)-C70 SCF, whereas their oxidation behaviors were dramatically different, indicating the profound influence of endohedral non-metal ions on the electronic structure of endohedral clusterfullerene.157 The electrochemical study on the first C76-based OCF—Sc2O@Td(19151)-C76—was reported by the same group later on, revealing one reversible oxidation step with peak potential of +0.32 V in the anodic region and up to five reduction steps in the cathodic region.159 In the reduction processes, the first reduction step showed good reversibility, whereas the second and the third reduction peaks were essentially overlapping with each other and apparently irreversible, and the fourth reduction process became reversible again. As for the Sc2O@C80 OCF, two reversible oxidation steps and five irreversible reduction steps were observed.161 The higher resemblance of the redox behavior of Sc2O@C2v(5)-C80 to Sc2C2@C2v(5)-C80 than those of Sc2O@Td(19151)-C76 and Sc2O@Cs(6)-C82, suggested that the frontier orbitals of Sc2O@C2v(5)-C80 were more related to the cage rather than the entrapped cluster. The similar case of cage-dependent electrochemical properties was also found in the Sc2O@C3v(8)-C82 OCF in comparison with Sc2S@C3v(8)-C82 and Sc2O@Cs(6)-C82.162 Sc2O@C3v(8)-C82 exhibited four reversible reduction steps and two oxidation steps, for which the first oxidation step was reversible while the second one was irreversible. The oxidation behavior of Sc2O@C3v(8)-C82 showed a similar pattern to that of Sc2S@C3v(8)-C82 rather than Sc2O@Cs(6)-C82, for which one reversible along with one irreversible oxidation were identified. Additionally, the first oxidation potential of Sc2O@C3v(8)-C82 (+0.54 V) was very close to that of Sc2S@C3v(8)-C82 (+0.52 V) but much more positive than that of Sc2O@Cs(6)-C82 (+0.35 V), suggesting once again the more important impact of the carbon cage instead of the endohedral cluster on their electronic structures. With respect to the reduction potential of Sc2O@C3v(8)-C82 and Sc2S@C3v(8)-C82, some perceptible differences were detected as well: the first (−1.17 V) and second (−1.44 V) peak potentials of Sc2O@C3v(8)-C82 were both more negative than those of Sc2S@C3v(8)-C82 (−1.04 and −1.19 V, respectively), whereas the third (−1.15 V) and fourth (−1.78 V) peak potentials became more positive than those of Sc2S@C3v(8)-C82. According to these results, it can be concluded that, in terms of Sc2O@C3v(8)-C82, the carbon cage plays a decisive role in its electronic structure, but the impact of the entrapped non-metal atom (O) cannot be ignored.162


4.2.4. CYCFs. 
The first electrochemical study of CYCF was reported in 2013 by our group.21 YNC@Cs(6)-C82 exhibited one reversible oxidation step at +0.56 V and four reversible reduction steps at −0.59, −0.84, −1.76 and −1.92 V, respectively. Interestingly, the first two reduction steps as well as the last two reduction steps were mutually close, as a result a large separation (0.92 V) was observed between the second and third reduction steps. Such a reduction behavior of YNC@Cs(6)-C82 highly resembled that of the reported Yb@Cs(6)-C82, for which one (quasi-) reversible oxidation step and four reversible reduction steps specifically with a comparably large separation (0.89 V) between the second and third reduction steps were observed.237 This is understandable according to their identical cage symmetries and the isoelectronic nature of the endohedral species.
More recently, we studied systematically the electrochemical properties of a series of Tb-based CYCFs, including three isomers of TbNC@C82 and the first non-IPR CYCF—TbNC@C76.27,28,169 A CV study of TbNC@C2(5)-C82 revealed the considerable reversibility accompanied by one reversible oxidation step and four reversible reduction steps (see Fig. 14a).27,169 The reduction potentials for TbNC@C2(5)-C82 were −0.88, −0.97, −1.55 and −1.91 V, respectively, which resembled that of the reported Yb@C2(5)-C82 with the difference of the reduction potentials being less than 0.05V. However, the reduction behavior of TbNC@C2(5)-C82 looked apparently different to that of YNC@Cs(6)-C82.21 Surprisingly, the oxidation potential of TbNC@C2(5)-C82 (+0.50 V) was slightly more negative than that of YNC@-Cs(6)-C82 (+0.56 V), but dramatically positively shifted by 0.12 V compared to Yb@C2(5)-C82 (+0.38 V). These results indicated clearly that, for TbCN@C2(5)-C82 CYCF, the fullerene cage had a dramatic influence on its oxidation properties correlating with the HOMO level, whereas the entrapped species exerted a strong influence on its reduction properties, especially on the LUMO level.21,27,237 Moreover, TbNC@Cs(6)-C82 exhibited one reversible oxidation step with a half-wave potential at 0.55 V in the anodic region. On the other hand, in the cathodic region, TbNC@Cs(6)-C82 showed four reversible reduction steps with half-wave potentials at −0.59, −0.84, −1.77, −1.92 V, respectively (see Fig. 14b). Such a complex reduction behavior was also found in TbNC@C2v(9)-C82, which showed four reversible reduction steps with half-wave potentials at −0.46, −0.81, −1.78, and −1.96 V, respectively. Similarly, one discernible oxidation step with a half-wave potential at 0.55 V was observed (see Fig. 14c). Noticeably, although the entrapped cluster was different, the redox behavior of TbNC@Cs(6)-C82 was almost identical to that of YNC@Cs(6)-C82.27 This is easily understood by considering that the frontier molecular orbitals of MNC@Cs(6)-C82 (M = Tb, Y) are predominately localized on the carbon cage.27 Upon decreasing the cage size from C82 to C76, surprisingly the redox behavior of the first non-IPR CYCF—TbNC@C2v(19138)-C76—was found to be similar to that of TbNC@C82 despite the appreciable shifts of the redox potentials. TbNC@C2v(19138)-C76 exhibited four reversible reduction steps with half-wave potentials at −0.91, −1.26, −1.78, and −2.19 V, respectively, as well as one reversible oxidation step with a half-wave potential at 0.45 V. These redox values are almost identical to those of YNC@C2v(19138)-C76. Besides, similar to the cases of YNC@Cs(6)-C82 and TbNC@C82 (Cs(6), C2(5), C2v(9)), although TbNC@C2v(19138)-C76 showed a larger separation between the second and third reduction steps (0.52 V) than those between the first two reduction steps (first–second, 0.35–0.38 V) and the last two reduction steps (third–fourth, 0.41–0.42 V), such a second–third separation was obviously smaller than that of TbNC@C2v(9)-C82 (0.97 V).28 These results reveal that the carbon cage plays a decisive role in the electronic structure of CYCFs like other types of endohedral clusterfullerenes.

4.2.5. Other endohedral clusterfullerenes. 
So far only a few SCFs have been separated, and their electrochemical studies are rarely reported.20,164–168 Among them, Ti2S@C78 is an unique member without any rare earth metal. Ti2S@D3h-C78 exhibited three reversible reduction steps with half-wave potentials at −0.92, −1.53, and −1.80 V, respectively, along with two additional irreversible reduction steps with peak potentials at −2.29 and −2.41 V, respectively. In the anodic region, two reversible oxidation steps with half-wave potentials at +0.23 and +0.65 V were observed plus one quasi-reversible oxidation step detected at +1.03 V.168 Noteworthily, the electrochemically reversible behavior of Ti2S@D3h-C78 was similar to that of TiSc2N@C80,88 Sc2S@C72,167 and Sc4O2@C80,154 but dramatically different to that of Sc3N@D3h-C78 with the same cage and formal charge state, which showed irreversible reduction steps, indicating that the entrapped clusters had a significant influence on the electrochemical behavior.47–50
With a hydrocarbon cluster Sc3CH inside, the electronic configuration of Sc3CH@C80 HCCF was proposed to be (Sc3CH)6+@C806−, which is similar to that of Sc3N@Ih-C80. Accordingly, it is expected that the electronic structure of Sc3CH@C80 HCCF is similar to that of the well-known Sc3N@Ih-C80.22,198 An electrochemical study of Sc3CH@C80 by Popov et al. indicated one oxidation step and three reduction steps. The oxidation potential of Sc3CH@C80 (+0.67 V) resembled that of Sc3N@Ih-C80 (+0.63 V). Likewise, both endohedral clusterfullerenes exhibited similar reduction behavior with irreversible first reduction steps at around −1.2 V. Because of their close first oxidation and reduction potentials, their electrochemical gaps are rather close as well.198

4.3. Chemical properties
Since the discovery of endohedral fullerene, its chemical functionalization has been attracting great attention from many researchers. Chemical functionalization of endohedral fullerene provides valuable possibilities to selectively modulate its chemical properties which are essentially important for the potential applications of endohedral fullerenes, as discussed in detail in the next section. Since the pioneering work by Akasaka et al. in 1995,250 so far many different types of functionalization reactions of endohedral clusterfullerenes have been developed, including Diels–Alder reactions, Prato reactions, Bingel–Hirsch reactions and some other cycloaddition reactions. Given that there are already several dedicated reviews on the chemical properties of endohedral fullerenes reported before 2013,3–6,12,13 in this section we focus on representative chemical reactions of different types of endohedral clusterfullerenes.

4.3.1. Diels–Alder reaction. 
In 2002 Dorn and coworkers reported the first [4+2] Diels–Alder cycloaddition reaction of NCF, affording a symmetric derivative of Sc3N@Ih(7)-C80 synthesized by the reaction of Sc3N@Ih(7)-C80 with 13C labeled 6,7-dimethoxyisochroman-3-one in 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene solution. According to 13C NMR characterization featuring a narrow single line for methylene, the presence of plane symmetry for the resultant monoadduct was deduced, and this together with the two nonequivalent protons of methylene shown by 1H NMR implies that the [4+2] cycloaddition took place on a localized [5,6] ring junction.251 Such a proposed reaction mechanism was soon confirmed by a crystallographic study by the same group, revealing that the Sc3N unit was positioned away from the site of addition and thus the carbon atoms immediately neighboring the scandium atoms protruded slightly from the surface of the fullerene cage.186
Applying this Diels–Alder cycloaddition reaction to Gd3N@C80 with 6,7-dimethoxy-3-isochromanone used as an alternative reagent, Stevenson and coworkers detected the bisadduct of Gd3N@C80 with an isolated yield of 10–20%. Note that, however, the addition site of two isochromanone groups onto the cage as well as their relative position to the entrapped Gd3N unit was uncertain due to the lack of NMR and crystallographic characterization.252 In 2006, Dorn and coworkers investigated the Diels–Alder reactivity discrepancy between M3N@Ih-C80 (M = Lu, Sc) and M3N@D5h-C80 (M = Lu, Sc) in terms of reaction with cyclopentadiene-functionalized resin, and found an improved reactivity of D5h isomers towards the Diels–Alder reaction in comparison to the Ih isomers of M3N@C80.52 This can be well explained by recognizing the smaller energy gaps of the D5h isomers than those of the Ih isomers as demonstrated by CV and theoretical molecular orbital computations.11,51–54,75,186,212 Therefore, the isomerism of the carbon cage plays a more important role in determining the reactivity than the internal metal cluster in terms of the Diels–Alder reaction. A detailed computational study of the reactivity of the Diels–Alder reaction based on two isomers (Ih and D5h) of M3N@C80 (M = Sc, Lu, Gd) was reported by Poblet and coworkers, indicating the higher reactivity of D5h isomers owing to their favorable kinetic factor.253


4.3.2. Bingel–Hirsch reaction. 
In 2005, Echegoyen and coworkers reported the first [2+1] reaction of NCF by reacting Y3N@Ih-C80 with excess diethyl bromomalonate in the presence of trace 1,8-diazobicyclo-[5.4.0]under-7-ene (DBU), giving an unexpected [6,6]-open monoadduct as confirmed by a crystallographic study.254 Surprisingly, it was not feasible to perform the same reaction for Sc3N@Ih-C80, suggesting that the entrapped species have a significant influence on [2+1] cycloaddition reactivity of NCFs. Interestingly, by adding a small amount of DMF, the [2+1] reaction of Sc3N@Ih-C80 readily occurred.255 Subsequently, the same group synthesized another [2+1] cycloaddition derivative of Y3N@Ih-C80 by replacing diethyl bromomalonate with bromo-dibenzylmalonate, obtaining a [6,6] adduct—Y3N@C80-C(CO2CH2Ph)2.58 The crystallographic structure showed a [6,6]-open structure with metal ions located immediately adjacent to the site of addition. A similar reaction was also carried out by the same authors on Er3N@Ih-C80, yielding the analogous [6,6]-open monoadduct.256
The effect of the cage size on the Bingel–Hirsch reactivity of NCF was further studied by Echegoyen and coworkers. By comparing the reactivities of Gd3N@C80, Gd3N@C84, and Gd3N@C88 in bromodiethylmalonate cycloaddition reactions,189 they found that both the monoadduct and bisadduct could be obtained for Gd3N@C80, whereas Gd3N@C84 engendered one monoadduct only under the identical reaction conditions, indicating its lower reactivity. Much lower reactivity was more pronounced in Gd3N@C88, which showed no sign of reaction even at an increased temperature. As a consequence, the authors concluded that, as the size of the carbon cage increased, a gradual decrease in the Bingel–Hirsch reactivity of NCFs occurred, at least for Gd3N@C2n.189 This conclusion is in line with the results reported by Dorn et al. later. By applying the same reaction to smaller-sized Sc-based NCFs Sc3N@C2n (2n = 68, 78) under the same conditions used for M3N@C80 (M = Y, Er, Gd), they obtained one monoadduct and a dominant bisadduct for Sc3N@C78 and up to pentaadducts for Sc3N@C68.257,258 This was apparently different from the case of Sc3N@C80 which failed to give any identifiable adduct.254
Notably, at present all of these above-mentioned Bingel–Hirsch derivatives of NCFs are methanofullerene (cyclopropane) adducts formed via the typical nucleophilic [2+1] cycloaddition mode. In contrast, Bingel–Hirsch derivatives of a monometallofullerene La@C82 were reported to include singly bonded adducts in addition to the conventional cyclopropane one.259 Such a single bond addition mode has never been observed in clusterfullerenes until the recent report on Bingel–Hirsch derivatives of TiSc2N@C80 MMNCF by our group.260 By reacting TiSc2N@Ih-C80 with excessive diethyl bromomalonate in the presence of DBU, two monoadducts were obtained whereas Sc3N@Ih-C80 did not react under identical conditions, revealing the dramatically improved reactivity as a result of one-atom substitution within the entrapped cluster. Moreover, dramatically to the paramagnetic properties of TiSc2N@C80 due to the existence of one unpaired electron localized on the 3d orbital of the Ti ion, as reflected by the obvious ESR signal, unexpectedly Bingel–Hirsch derivatives of TiSc2N@C80 became ESR-silent. As a matter of fact, the magnetic properties of the pristine NCFs are generally retained in the conventional Bingel–Hirsch cycloadducts (either cyclopropane or methanofulleroid) reported to date. However, similar to the case of La@C82 which exhibited four singly bonded Bingel–Hirsch monoadducts with disappearance of the ESR signal of the pristine La@C82 along with one conventional cyclopropane adduct retaining the ESR signal of the pristine La@C82,259 the disappearance of the ESR signal of the pristine TiSc2N@C80 implied the unusual singly bonded addition pattern of TiSc2N@C80.260 More recently such an implication was confirmed by a similar Bingel–Hirsch reaction of Y2TiN@Ih-C80. The crystallographic study of its Bingel–Hirsch product unambiguously disclosed the singly bonded addition pattern (see Fig. 15).261 Additionally, based on theoretical calculations, the reaction mechanism for the formation of the singly bonded monoadduct of TiY2N@C80 was proposed, featuring the formation of an intermediate [TiY2N@C80-CBr(COOC2H5)2]− which was stabilized by oxidation and converted finally to the singly bonded monoadduct.261

4.3.3. Prato reaction. 
Two research groups, Echegoyen and Dorn, reported almost at the same time in 2005 the first Prato reaction of an NCF. By adding an excess of N-ethylglycine and formaldehyde into an o-DCB solution of Sc3N@Ih-C80, a [5,6]-addition pyrrolidino derivative was synthesized with a high selectivity.262,263 Later on, an efficient retro-cycloaddition of this pyrrolidino derivative was also developed under high temperature reflux with addition of maleic anhydride.264 Afterwards, the authors applied a similar reaction for Y3N@Ih-C80 and Er3N@Ih-C80, and found that the reaction afforded an unexpected [6,6]-addition derivative, which was evidently contrary to the case of Sc3N@Ih-C80, indicating the effect of entrapped species on the regioselectivity of NCFs.254,256 It was interesting that these two [6,6]-adducts underwent isomerization to [5,6]-adducts under high temperature treatment. The influence of the entrapped cluster of NCF on the addition pattern of the Prato reaction was studied in-depth theoretically by Poblet and coworkers, revealing that the [5,6]-site was preferred for those NCFs entrapping small-sized clusters. However, for NCFs entrapping large-sized clusters, deformation of the carbon cage occurred more or less, resulting in the change of the active sites of [5,6]- and [6,6]-addition, and consequently the [6,6]-addition site was preferred.265,266 Nevertheless, in the same year, surprisingly Dorn and coworkers reported that a Prato reaction of Sc3N@Ih-C80 with N-triphenylmethyl-5-oxazolidinone generated both [5,6]- and [6,6]-adducts, whose structures were definitely determined by X-ray crystallography. With high temperature treatment, the gradual conversion of the [6,6]-adduct to the [5,6]-adduct was observed, revealing that the former was a kinetically stable product while the thermodynamically stable product could be assigned to the latter.267 More recently, Akasaka and coworkers reported another Prato reaction of Sc3N@Ih-C80 with aziridine, affording a [5,6]-addition derivative.268 In 2016 Lu and coworkers reported 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of Sc3N@Ih-C80 with 3,5-dichloro-2,4,6-trimethoxybenzonitrile oxide providing the first isoxazoline-ring containing [5,6]-addition derivative as confirmed by the crystallographic study.269 Other than the Ih isomer of M3N@C80, the 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reaction of the D5h isomer of Sc3N@C80 with tritylazomethineylide was elaboratively studied by Dorn and coworkers.52 The authors stated that the D5h isomer of Sc3N@C80 was more reactive toward 1,3-diploar cycloaddition reaction in comparison with the Ih isomer under identical reaction conditions. The enhanced reactivity was understandable by considering the particular pyracylene motif localized in the D5h isomer. Additionally, two monoadducts and bisadducts were detected for Sc3N@D5h-C80, whereas for Sc3N@Ih-C80 only one isomer was observed. According to 1H NMR characterization, these two monoadducts could be assigned as symmetric and asymmetric products, respectively.52 The Prato reaction was further applied to Sc3N@C78, affording two [6,6]-adducts as demonstrated by single crystal X-ray analysis.49 Recently, Yamakoshi et al. reported regioselective synthesis of pyrrolidino bisadducts of M3N@C80 (M = Gd, Y) with second addition arising at the [6,6]-site of monoadducts providing [6,6]–[6,6] bisadducts (see Fig. 16).270 Likewise, the progressive isomerization of [6,6] to [5,6] happened to the bisadduct of Y3N@C80 as well under thermal conditions, while that of Gd3N@C80 remained almost intact, indicating the high stability of derivatives of NCFs dependent on the entrapped species.

In 2007, Wang and coworkers systematically investigated the regiochemistry of Prato reactions of ScxGd3−xN@Ih-C80 (x = 0–3) MMNCFs with N-ethylglycine and formaldehyde. They found that, in agreement with the theoretical predictions by Poblet et al., the pyrrolidino cycloadditions depended remarkably on the size of the entrapped cluster since the [5,6]-adduct was favored for the smallest cluster (Sc3N)-based NCF, whereas for the largest cluster (Gd3N)-based NCF, the [6,6]-adduct was dominant and both adducts were formed for the middle-sized cluster (Sc2GdN and ScGd2N)-based MMNCFs.271 Similar results were found also for ScxY3−xN@Ih-C80 (x = 0–3) MMNCFs, for which [5,6]-adducts were identified in Sc3N@C80 and Sc2YN@C80, while an abrupt change in regioselectivity took place in ScY2N@C80 which formed the [6,6]-adduct as a minor regioisomer. With respect to Y3N@C80 with the largest cluster, the [6,6]-regioisomer appeared to be the major product.272
Prato reactions based on CCFs were investigated by two research groups in terms of Sc3C2@C80 and Sc2C2@C80. In 2010, Wang and coworkers reported the addition of N-ethylglycine to Sc3C2@C80 giving rise to a [5,6]-monoadduct. The spin density distribution was strongly changed upon pyrrolidine addend as illustrated by the ESR spectrum. The alteration of the paramagnetic properties induced by exohedral modification was also manifested in a bisadduct of Sc3C2@C80 reported by the same group.273 Recently, Akasaka and coworkers carried out the Prato reaction of two isomers of Sc2C2@C82 (Cs(6) and C2v(9)). One dominant [6,6]-monoadduct was obtained for the Cs(6) isomer, suggesting its remarkably high regioselectivity. Three monoadduct isomers were produced for the C2v(9) isomer. Among them, an unexpected [5,6]-monoadduct was proved to be the major product as confirmed by the crystallographic study.121,234 More recently, another isomer of Sc2C2@C3v(8)-C82 was reacted with 3-triphenylmethyl-5-oxazolidinone by Lu and coworkers, yielding the corresponding pyrrolidino derivative with the [6,6] addition mode as revealed by the X-ray crystallographic study.274


4.3.4. Carbene reaction. 
In 2005, Akasaka and coworkers carried out the carbine reaction of a CCF for the first time. By irradiating a 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene/benzene solution of Sc3C2@C80 and an excess molar amount of 2-adamantane-2-3-[3H]-diazirine with a high-pressure mercury arc lamp in a degassed sealed tube at room temperature, Sc3C2@C80 adamantylidene carbene (Ad) monoadduct featuring a carbide nature formed as definitely revealed by a single crystal X-ray diffraction study.150 Interestingly, upon performing the similar reaction for Sc2C2@C3v(8)-C82, the formation of a [5,6]-open monoadduct—Sc2C2@C3v(8)-C82(Ad) —was observed.18 Because of the rigid instinct of the adamantylidene carbene group that facilitates the growth of single crystal of fullerene, Ad has been widely used for exohedral functionalization of endohedral clusterfullerenes. In particular, functionalization of several other Sc-based CCFs with Ad were systematically studied by Akasaka and coworkers.18,123,124,150,275,276 For instance, the reaction of Ad with Sc2C2@C2v(5)-C82 produced five regioisomers with respective abundances of 20%, 40%, 25%, 5% and 10%, respectively, among which the single crystals of four major isomers were facilely obtained due to the rigid nature of the Ad group.123,124 The concrete crystallographic results promised the elaborative investigation of their structures, revealing that the addition mostly occurred at a cage region on top of the arch of the carbide cluster.123,124 Recently, the Ad addition reaction was applied to react with Sc2C2@D2d(23)-C84 by the same group, giving rise to the formation of four adducts, which is in stark contrast to the case of empty D2d(23)-C84, for which only two adducts were obtained, indicating that doping the Sc2C2 moiety inside the D2d(23)-C84 cage drastically altered its chemical reactivity.277 Additionally, the first trial of reaction of Ad with M3N@Ih-C80 (M = Sc, Lu) was implemented by Akasaka et al., leading to finding two isomeric derivatives taking both [6,6] and [5,6] addition patterns. In contrast, three major isomeric Ad adducts were observed when applying the reaction on Sc3N@D5h-C80. This was due to more types of C–C bonds in the D5h-C80 cage compared with the Ih-C80 cage.278
Recently, Akasaka developed a new carbine reaction on Sc3C2@C80 by using a substituted tetrazine as a reagent, affording an unprecedented bisfulleroid derivative containing a doubly bridged 14-membered ring, which was obviously different from the presumptive derivative with a four-membered ring as demonstrated by a similar reaction previously performed on C60 by Rubin and coworkers.279 DFT calculations claimed that the difference in the addition pattern between Sc3C2@C80 and C60 was due to their different pyramidalization degree of the carbon cages.280 In 2013, Echegoyen and coworkers successfully synthesized a novel methanofullerene of Sc3N@C80 NCF by reacting with a diaryldiazo compound, yielding both [5,6] and [6,6]-open monoadducts.281 The mild reaction to generate the high yield of derivative showed the high reactivity of Sc3N@C80 towards the diaryldiazo compound. Besides, with the substitution of the groups at the para-position of the phenyl ring, the reactivity of the as-formed carbene changed and consequently the ratio of [5,6] and [6,6] isomers was altered. Note that the carbine reactions of endohedral fullerenes reported so far are all based on in situ formed carbene, which has the general formula of RC: containing a neutral carbon atom with a valence of two unshared valence electrons. Breaking such a limit, very recently Lu and coworkers reported an abnormal carbene addition derivative of Sc3N@C80 by using N-heterocyclic carbene (NCH) as a reagent as illustrated in Fig. 17.282 Single crystal X-ray diffraction results unambiguously revealed that the abnormal NCH 1 was bonded to the Sc3N@Ih-C80 instead of the normal one 1′. Another interesting finding was that an unprecedented singly bonded [6,6,6]-adduct of Sc3N@Ih-C80 was generated in the reaction process, which was in sharp contrast to the commonly observed [5,6,6]-adduct. Theoretical calculations pointed out that the cage size as well as electron density distribution accounted for Sc3N@Ih-C80 to selectively trap the rare abnormal NCH 1. Interestingly, their more recent work demonstrated that introducing a tiny quantity of oxygen into this reaction led to the stabilization of a normal NCH 1 addition product with an extra oxygen atom bonded in its vicinity. Theoretical calculation results disclosed that the presence of oxygen atoms added on Sc3N@Ih-C80 resulted in release of steric hindrance between the NCH moiety and fullerene cage, which ultimately facilitated the formation of a NCH 1 attached adduct. The similar case was also observed in the same reaction based on Lu3N@Ih-C80.283

4.3.5. Other reactions. 
In 2007, Boltalina and coworkers synthesized the first trifluoromethylated derivatives of Sc3N@C80.284 Successful isolation of the major product—Sc3N@C80(CF3)2—enabled its structure elucidation. A 19F NMR study indicated a 1,4-addition pattern. Subsequently, the same group reported a series of multiadducts—Sc3N@C80(CF3)n (n = 2–16)—and two of them, including Sc3N@C80(CF3)10 and Sc3N@C80(CF3)12, were characterized by X-ray crystallography.285 In 2011, Yang and Troyanov et al. synthesized four new isomers of Sc3N@Ih-C80(CF3)14 and one new isomer of Sc3N@Ih-C80(CF3)16via reacting Sc3N@Ih-C80 with CF3I at 400 °C.53 The X-ray crystallographic study clearly disclosed their structures and addition sites. Theoretical calculations manifested that the addition pattern of CF3 had a strong influence on the behavior of the entrapped Sc3N cluster. In addition, by using the same strategy, the authors obtained the first trifluoromethylated derivative of Sc3N@D5h-C80 with up to 18 CF3 units connected onto the D5h-C80 cage. X-ray crystallographic results indicated the similar addition pattern of Sc3N@D5h-C80(CF3)18 with Sc3N@Ih-C80(CF3)14. More recently, the same groups exhaustively investigated the trifluoromethylation reaction of two isomers of Sc3N@C80 with CF3I, leading to the discovery of one new derivative Sc3N@D5h-C80(CF3)16 and two new isomers of Sc3N@Ih-C80(CF3)14 (VI, VII) in addition to the reported isomers.286 The definite structural determination was accomplished by a crystallographic study, unveiling the intriguing structural relations between different isomers. Specifically, the newly found Sc3N@D5h-C80(CF3)16 presented the precursor of previously reported Sc3N@D5h-C80(CF3)18 due to its identical addition mode, and a similar case was also observed in Sc3N@Ih-C80(CF3)14 and Sc3N@Ih-C80(CF3)16.273 More recently, the similar trifluoromethylation reaction was extended to CYCF, affording the first trifluoromethylated derivative of CYCF. The as-formed trifluoromethylated mixture of YNC@Cs(6)-C82, YNC@Cs(6)-C82(CF3)14−20, and YCN@Cs(6)-C82(CF3)16/18 was separated by HPLC and their molecular structures were identified by X-ray crystallography, revealing asymmetric addition patterns that involved 11 cage pentagons and left the remaining one free for coordination of the entrapped Y atom. Interestingly, such structural features were actually similar to those of Sc3N@C80(CF3)n discussed above.187 In 2011, Wang, Yang and Balch et al. reacted Sc3N@Ih-C80 with in situ generated 4,5-diispropoxybenzyne and synthesized an unprecedented open-cage derivative involving a hitherto largest 13-membered ring, whose structure was unambiguously characterized by a single crystal X-ray study.274 Further study unveiled that the aerobic atmosphere was the prerequisite for the formation of this open-cage compound since the normal [2+2] benzyne adducts were obtained under an inert atmosphere instead.287 More recently, the same authors studied the azide addition reaction of Sc3N@Ih-C80, obtaining aza-bridged annulene-type metallofulleroids.288 Interestingly, thermal treatment of Sc3N@Ih-C80 with 4-isopropoxyphenyl afforded both [6,6]- and [5,6]-azafulleroids, while only a [6,6]-azafulleroid isomer formed under photochemical reaction. This phenomenon was in contradiction with the computation-predicted higher stability for the [5,6]-azafulleroid isomer. Accordingly, the favorable kinetic factor was responsible for the generation of the [6,6]-azafulleroid isomer.
The coordination chemistry of NCF was recently studied by Lu and coworkers. Two isomers of Sc3N@C80 (Ih and D5h) reacted with W(CO)4(Ph2PC2H4PPh2) under photo-irradiation with a mercury-arc lamp, yielding one mononuclear complex for each Sc3N@C80 isomer.289 Crystallographic analysis explicitly revealed that the addition site took place at the [6,6]-junction for each isomer. More recently, Echegoyen et al. performed the cyclopropanation reaction of Sc3N@C68/Sc3N@D5h-C80 with p-toluenesulfonyl tosyl hydrazone of phenyl butyric acid methyl ester affording the so-called PCBM-Sc3N@C2n (2n = 68, 80) derivatives, and one of the isomers of PCBM-Sc3N@D5h-C80 was unambiguously characterized by a crystallographic study revealing a [6,6]-addition pattern. Besides, the preferred reactivity of Sc3N@C68 compared with Sc3N@D5h-C80 offered a simple and efficient strategy for separation of Sc3N@D5h-C80 from Sc3N@C68 by adding an accurate amount of reagents to the complex and removing Sc3N@C68.290

4.4. Magnetic properties
Upon the encapsulation of lanthanide ions, which have unfilled 4f shells, into the fullerene cage, the resultant endohedral fullerenes exhibit fascinating magnetic properties.5,72,93,291–293 In particular, for NCFs with three magnetic metal ions entrapped, their magnetic properties are particularly attractive. In 2005, Dunsch and coworkers firstly investigated the magnetic properties of M3N@C80 (M = Ho, Tb) by means of the superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) technique, indicating the effective magnetic moments of 17 and 21 μB for Tb3N@C80 and Ho3N@C80, respectively.93 Following this method, the magnetic properties of other NCFs, including ErxSc3−xN@C80,291 Er3N@C80,292 Tm3N@C8072 and Gd3N@C80,293 were studied, for which the details have been summarized in previous reviews.5
In 2012, Greber and coworkers reported the first single-molecular magnetism (SMM) study of NCF.24 Both X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) and SQUID studies of DySc2N@Ih-C80 MMNCF revealed a characteristic butterfly-shape hysteresis of magnetization curves at temperatures below 6 K, revealing that DySc2N@C80 behaved as a mononuclear SMM with long relaxation time of magnetization.24 Later on, a shrinking of the opening of the hysteresis of DySc2N@C80 was observed with increasing X-ray flux in the process of low-temperature XMCD measurement.294 A follow-up systematic study of DyxSc3−xN@C80 (x = 1, 2, 3) showed that, despite the fact that the three SMM compounds exhibited distinct hysteresis, their magnetic ground states could be altered by modulating the composition of the entrapped cluster (DyxSc3−xN). In zero field the magnetization of DySc2N@C80 decayed via quantum tunneling, while ferromagnetic coupling of the individual dysprosium moments resulted in remanence for Dy2ScN@C80 and in a frustrated ground state for Dy3N@C80, which represented the simplest frustrated ground state to date.295 In 2015, the interaction of the entrapped species (Dy2ScN) within DySc2N@C80 SMM with a rhodium substrate was studied by Greber et al., and the parallel orientation of Dy2ScN to the substrate surface was proposed in light of the comparison of the angular anisotropy of X-ray absorption spectra and multiplet calculations in the corresponding ligand field.296
An exhaustive study of the magnetic properties of CCFs was accomplished by Popov, Greber and coworkers in 2015. SQUID measurements of Dy2TiC@C80-I indicated magnetic hysteresis with a temperature-dependent opening, implying a slow relaxation of the magnetization with a decay rate that depended on the temperature.26 The 100 s blocking temperature (TB100) of Dy2TiC@C80-I, which can be used to evaluate the stability of the remnant magnetization, was 1.7 K. Noteworthily, the determined TB100 = 1.7 K for Dy2TiC@C80-I was smaller than that of Dy2ScN@C80 (3.6 K), suggesting the impact of the entrapped nonmetal ions on the magnetic properties of clusterfullerenes. Such an impact was further confirmed by comparing the magnetic properties of Dy2TiC@C80 (I, II) to Dy2TiC2@C80. The similar field dependence as well as the same TB100 value within 0.1 K were identified in two isomers of Dy2TiC@C80 (I, II), indicating the resemblance of their magnetic properties. Quite different from Dy2TiC@C80 (I, II), Dy2TiC2@C80 displayed a rather narrower hysteresis and small TB100 values. As a consequence, it was concluded that the type of entrapped species played a vital role in determining the magnetic properties rather than the cage isomerism in terms of X@C80 (I, II, X = Dy2TiC, Dy2TiC2).26
More recently, the SMM properties of CYCFs were identified using SQUID studies by Yang and coworkers based on a systematic study of three isomers of TbCN@C82 (C2, Cs, C2v) and the first non-IPR CYCF TbCN@C2v(19138)-C76.27,28 Three isomers of TbNC@C82 (C2, Cs, C2v) were assigned to SMMs in view of their identical magnetic ground state of Jz = 6, which correlated with their magnetic moments determined to be 9.0, 9.1 and 10.2 μB, respectively (see Fig. 18). Alternating current (AC) susceptibility measurements disclosed significantly temperature-dependent magnetic relaxation times of TbCN@C82 (C2, Cs, C2v). Except for TbNC@C2v(9)-C82, the magnetic relaxation times saturated at the lowest temperatures of 1.8 K, indicating that the lifetimes for the quantum tunneling of the magnetization were in the order of 10 to 50 ms. Since the magnetic relaxation times measured at 1.8 K increased sensitively with shortening of the Tb–C(N) distance, the dependence of magnetic relaxation time of TbNC@C82 on the atomic distance within the TbNC unit was illustrated.27 A more recent SQUID study of TbCN@C2v(19138)-C76 identified its similar SMM behavior with a magnetic moment of 8.9 μB.28

The magnetic properties of several other clusterfullerenes were investigated by means of electron paramagnetic resonance (ESR or alias EPR) spectroscopy due to its easy operation and less requirement of the sample amount. In 2013, Wang and coworkers reported the ESR spectrum of an anion radical of Sc2C2@C72 CCF, showing a highly symmetric 15 lines.127 This can be interpreted by recognizing hyperfine couplings between the unpaired electron and two equivalent scandium nuclei. The hyperfine coupling constants (hfcc) and g factor of Sc2C2@Cs-C72 were observed to be 0.77 G and 2.005, respectively. This character indicated that the spin density of Sc2C2@Cs-C72 was mainly delocalized on the carbon cage, which agreed well with the DFT calculation results.127 The influence of the entrapped cluster on the electron spin properties of CCFs was later investigated for anion radicals of Y2@Cs-C82, Y2C2@Cs-C82, and Sc2C2@Cs-C82 by the same group, offering their potential applications in quantum information processing by controllably manipulating the type of entrapped cluster.297 Concretely, the ESR spectrum of the Y2@Cs-C82 anion radical showed three lines with an intensity ratio of 1:2:1, and the hyperfine coupling constant as well as g value were identified to be 34.3 G and 2.0025, respectively. In contrast to the Y2@Cs-C82 anion radical, an asymmetric ESR spectrum was observed for the Y2C2@Cs-C82 anion radical along with hfcc and g values being a(Y1) = 0.4 G, a(Y2) = 0.45 G, and g = 2.00383, indicating that the two entrapped Y ions were nonequivalent. Besides, the distinctly different hfcc detected in anion radicals of Y2@Cs-C82 and Y2C2@Cs-C82 suggested their different localization of spin density. Generally, the large hfcc means the unpaired spin is primarily localized on metal nuclei, otherwise it is localized on the carbon cage. Thus, the localization of unpaired spin on two yttrium ions for the Y2@C82 anion radical, and on the carbon cage for the Y2C2@C82 anion radical was clearly deduced. The spin density located on the carbon cage was also determined for the Sc2C2@C82 anion radical which has similar ESR parameters to the Y2C2@C82 anion radical.297 In view of the obvious different ESR behavior with insertion of a C2 unit into Cs-C82-based endohedral fullerenes, the controllable manipulation of the spin distributions on endohedral fullerenes can be achieved.
Moreover, the magnetic property manipulation of endohedral fullerene via exohedral functionalization was further accomplished by Wang et al. via adjusting finely the distance of the nitroxide radical attached onto Sc3C2@C80.298 Briefly, the ESR signals of Sc3C2@C80 were gradually strengthened along with shortening of the length from the nitroxide radical to Sc3C2@C80 (see Fig. 19). The dependence of the intensity of the ESR signal on the distance was reasonable by considering the spin–spin interactions between Sc3C2@C80 and the nitroxide radical. Likewise, when decreasing the temperature, the progressive enhanced signal was detected. Hence, it seemed that the remote nitroxide group served as a magnetic switch for the ESR signal of Sc3C2@C80, which can modulate the ESR signal towards promising applications in versatile fields. In this sense, our recently synthesized singly bonded Bingel–Hirsch derivatives of TiM2N@C80 (M = Sc, Y) provide another example of facile manipulation of the paramagnetic properties via chemical functionalization. TiM2N@C80 (M = Sc, Y) are typical ESR-active compounds, which turn into ESR-silent compounds after addition of a diethyl bromomalonate group in the form of single bonding instead of normal cycloaddition as discussed above.88,89,261,299 Such switchable ESR signals may find potential application in many fields such as quantum computers.

As the only group-V metal-based NCFs isolated to date, the magnetic properties of VxSc3−xN@Ih-C80 (x = 1, 2) were studied by our group.90 Based on the electronic configuration of {[(V3+)x(Sc3+)3−x]N3−}6+@C806−, their paramagnetic properties are deemed due to the existence of two unpaired electrons localized on the 3d orbital of V ions. The ESR spectra of VSc2N@C80 and V2ScN@C80 showed broad signals with the g-factor of 1.9998 and 2.1998, respectively. In addition to the smaller g-factor of VSc2N@C80 than that of V2ScN@C80, the line width of the ESR signal of VSc2N@C80 (36 G) was also much smaller than that of V2ScN@C80 (72 G), indicating that the magnetic properties of VxSc3−xN@C80 (x = 1, 2) are tunable upon varying the number of entrapped V atoms. The reason for their discrepancy in the ESR signal was because the spin density was mainly located on the V3+ ion(s) for both VSc2N and V2ScN clusters as revealed by DFT calculations. Therefore, it is very likely that the smaller g-factor and line width of the ESR signal of VSc2N@C80 than those of V2ScN@C80 is due to the entrapment of one more paramagnetic V3+ ion within V2ScN@C80.90
The magnetic properties of the Sc3NC@C80 CNCF were also studied using ESR.300 The ESR spectrum of the Sc3NC@C80 anion radical exhibited thirty-six lines with high symmetry. The hyperfine coupling constants (hfcc) were 3.89 G for two equivalent Sc nuclei and 1.946 G for the third Sc nuclei. Interestingly, by comparing the observed hfcc with the calculated parameters, it was facile to distinguish the center atom of the internal Sc3NC moiety although it was difficult to differentiate C and N atoms by single crystal X-ray diffraction. The hfcc obtained with the C atom located in the center was closer to the experimental values than that obtained by assuming N lying in the center, indicating that, although two nonmetal (N and C) atoms could be simultaneously entrapped within the Ih-C80 cage, the C atom preferentially resided in the center.
For Sc4C2H@C80 HCCF, the entrapment of one H atom leads to an open-shell electronic structure, thus its paramagnetic properties can be anticipated. Indeed, Sc4C2H@C80 showed peculiar ESR features. The signal of the room-temperature ESR spectrum of Sc4C2H@C80 was so broad that it even cannot be observed.170 However, the line width decreased and the signal intensity gradually increased with the lowering of the measurement temperature, and the hyperfine coupling splitting did not emerge even when decreasing to 2 K. This phenomenon is similar to the case of Ti-based MMNCF—TiM2N@C80 (M = Sc, Y) as discussed above.88,89,261,300
4.5. Photophysical properties
Owing to their unique molecular structures, endohedral clusterfullerenes are expected to possess fascinating photophysical properties. Compared to the aforementioned electronic, chemical, and magnetic properties, the photophysical properties of endohedral clusterfullerenes have been less studied, and the available reports on the photophysical study of endohedral clusterfullerenes are mainly related to two aspects including the fluorescence spectroscopic studies of the pristine endohedral clusterfullerenes and the fluorescence/transient spectroscopic studies of their dyad derivatives.5
The first fluorescence spectroscopic study of the pristine endohedral clusterfullerene was carried out in 2001 by Dorn and coworkers.301 The fluorescence spectra of ErxSc3−xN@C80 (x = 1–3) exhibited eight principal lines between 1510 and 1610 nm, signifying the transition from 4I13/2 → 4I15/2 of Er3+. Of particular interest was that ErSc2N@C80 and Er2ScN@C80 both showed a doublet structure of 4I13/2 → 4I15/2 transition, while only a single line was detected in Er3N@C80. This can be explained by considering the different positions of Er atoms inside the cages of MMNCFs. The fluorescence lifetimes of ErSc2N@C80, Er2ScN@C80 and Er3N@C80 at 1.6 K were determined to be 1.51, 1.57, and 1.15 μs, respectively, which were reduced by 10–20% from 2 to 300 K. The fluorescence quantum efficiency was very low (∼10−4) due to the quenching via interactions with the high-frequency vibrations of the carbon cage. Further extensive fluorescence spectroscopic studies of ErxSc3−xN@C80 MMNCFs were later reported by Briggs and co-workers, revealing similar phenomena.302–305
In 2007, Shinohara and coworkers reported a photoluminescence (PL) study of Er2C2@C82 (I, II, III) CCFs. Three isomers of Er2C2@C82 (I, II, III) with cage symmetry of Cs(6), C2v(9) and C3v(8), respectively, exhibited similar 4I13/2 → 4I15/2 emission patterns at room temperature.130 However, the PL intensities varied for these three isomers, indicating the dependence of PL intensity on the cage structure. Among them, Er2C2@C82 (III) showed the strongest PL, which was nearly 150 times higher than those of Er2C2@C82 (I, II). The difference was primarily caused by the existence of absorbance of these carbon cages at about 1500 nm. The absorption onsets of Er2C2@C82 (I, II) were observed at around 1500 nm, which was blue-shifted to 1250 nm for Er2C2@C82 (III), suggesting that the carbon cage of Er2C2@C82 (III) was transparent to the PL of the encapsulated Er3+ whereas the Er-based emissions in the isomers I and II were quenched by the energy transfer to the lowest excited states of the carbon cage. Furthermore, the cage symmetry-dependent PL intensity was also observed in conventional dimetallofullerenes Er2@C82 (I, II, III) sharing the same cage symmetry with the corresponding Er2C2@C82 (I, II, III) CCFs. Interestingly, the PL intensities of Er2C2@C82 CCFs were predominantly higher than those of conventional dimetallofullerene Er2@C82. Very recently, the same group reported a near-infrared PL study of thulium (Tm)-based CCFs—Tm2C2@C82 (I, II, III).306 The authors observed an efficient energy transfer from excited states of the C82 cage to the 3F4 state of the entrapped Tm3+ ion under 800 nm excitation. As a result, a 1800 nm emission occurred due to the decay from the 3F4 → 3H6 state. When excited at 405 nm, energy transfer happened to 3H4 instead of the 3H6 state of the entrapped Tm3+ ion. Consequently, emission from 3H4 → 3F4 as well as 3F4 → 3H6 transition was detected. Thus, it can be concluded that the PL properties of Tm2C2@C82 depended on the excitation energy. The discrepancy in the PL properties of Tm2C2@C82 (I, II, III) was found to be related to their HOMO–LUMO gap. Those with a large HOMO–LUMO gap (e.g., Tm2C2@C82 (III) with a relative large HOMO–LUMO gap of 0.99 eV) always exhibited strong PL intensity, whereas a weaker PL signal (e.g. Tm2C2@C82 (I) with a HOMO–LUMO gap of 0.83 eV) was observed due to the quenching effect of the fullerene cage.
On the other hand, photoinduced electron transfer in endohedral fullerene-based donor–acceptor systems is another active field of photophysical studies of endohedral clusterfullerenes. The photophysical study of an endohedral clusterfullerene-based donor–acceptor complex was reported for the first time by Guldi and coworkers in 2008.307 Upon photoexcitation of N-methyl-2-ferrocenyl-[5,6]-Sc3N@C80-pyrrolidine dyad at 388 nm, the Sc3N@Ih-C80-based singlet excited state of the dyad decayed rapidly within 5 ps into the radical ion pair state, which was metastable and decayed with a lifetime of 128 ps in carbon disulfide and 84 ps in o-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB). Such an excited state lifetime was evidently longer than that of the C60-based counterpart, suggesting the uniqueness of endohedral clusterfullerenes. Since then extensive photophysical studies of versatile donor–acceptor complexes of endohedral clusterfullerenes have been reported, and details can be found in previous reviews published before 2013.3–5 In the following we focus on the latest achievements after 2013.
Photoinduced electron transfer between two endohedral fullerenes, including Sc3N@C80 as an electron donor and the triplet excited state of Li@C60 as an electron acceptor, was studied by Fukuzumi et al. in 2013.308 Upon nanosecond laser excitation at 355 nm in a benzonitrile solution containing Li@C60 and Sc3N@C80, electron transfer from Sc3N@C80 to the triplet excited state [3(Li@C60)*] took place, resulting in the radical cation [Sc3N@C80]˙+ and anion [Li@C60]˙−. The second-order rate constant of electron transfer between Sc3N@C80 and 3(Li@C60)*, depending on the concentration of Sc3N@C80, was determined to be 1.5 × 109 M−1 s−1, which was slightly smaller than that of back electron transfer (1.9 × 109 M−1 s−1). Likewise, the driving force of electron transfer from Sc3N@C80 to 3(Li@C60)*, originating from the difference of the oxidation potential of Sc3N@C80 and the reduction potential of 3(Li@C60)*, was determined to be 0.58 V, which was again smaller than the value of the driving force in the back electron transfer process.
A new donor–acceptor conjugate comprising Sc3N@C80 and corrole was investigated by Guldi, Lu and Li et al. in 2015.309 The authors proposed that, in the electronically excited state, a fast and quantitative electron transfer gave rise to the formation of [Sc3N@C80]˙− and [corrole]˙+ upon their unique respective photoexcitation. The charge combination lifetimes of metastable [Sc3N@C80]˙−–[corrole]˙+ in various solvents, such as toluene, THF and benzonitrile, were determined to be 27 ± 2, 14 ± 1 and 13 ± 1 ps, respectively. The singlet ground state was reinstated in the wake of the radical ion pair state decays, which lasted for 21 ± 4, 19 ± 4 and 16 ± 5 ps in toluene, THF and benzonitrile, respectively, under 387 nm excitation.
Although photoinduced electron transfer within endohedral clusterfullerenes has been realized, how the cage symmetry as well as the grafted group affects the photoexcited electron transfer remains an unsolved issue. By means of ultrafast transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy, recently Wang and Luo et al. unveiled the photoexcited electron dynamics of three isomers of Sc2C2@C82 (Cs, C2v and C3v) CCFs and two corresponding derivatives.310 In ultrafast TA measurements, setting the wavelength of the pump pulse at 530 nm which fitted to excite Sc2C2@C82 from the electronic ground state (S0) to a certain high-lying excited state (Sn), Cs and C3v isomers presented the analogous relaxation kinetics featuring an initial and rapid build-up of TA signal along with time constants of biexponential decay at Γ1 = 4.7 ± 0.3 ps and Γ2 = 67 ± 4 ps for the Cs isomer and Γ1 = 3.1 ± 0.1 ps and Γ2 = 59 ± 4 ps for the C3v isomer (see Fig. 20). For the C2v isomer, three time constants of relaxation at Γ1 = 4.7 ± 1.4 ps, Γ2 = 138 ± 31 ps, and Γ3 > 3.6 ± 1.1 ps were determined. The obviously different relaxation behaviors were elucidated by DFT calculations, figuring out that the relative large energy separation of the relevant S–T pair was responsible for the two time constants of isomers Cs and C3v. While, for the case of the C2v isomer, the S2 state evolved into an effective “top” of the population flow along the cascading internal conversion because of the existence of nearly degenerate S2–S5 pair as well as the largest energy separation between S2 and S1. Moreover, the photoinduced electron dynamics of Sc2C2@C3v-C82 with two different functional groups attached, which, respectively, served as an electron donor and acceptor, was studied. Interestingly, the addition of an electron acceptor barely changed the TA kinetics as evidenced by the same time constants of biexponential decay for both pristine Sc2C2@C3v-C82 and the acceptor-containing adduct. In contrast, the presence of an electron donor within the adduct dramatically altered the TA kinetics.310

5. Potential applications of endohedral clusterfullerenes
The unique properties of endohedral clusterfullerenes, derived from their peculiar metal cluster–cage hybrid structures as well as the versatility of the type of entrapped metal clusters, endow them with promising applications in various fields such as biomedicine, energy conversion and so on.
5.1. Biomedical and radiopharmaceutical applications
The current commercially available magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agent are all based on gadolinium (Gd) chelate complexes (i.e. Gd–DTPA, DTPA = diethylenetriamino-pentaacetic acid), which can greatly increase the relaxation rate of water protons and thereby improve the imaging quality.315 However, the fatal disadvantage of releasing traces of Gd3+ ions within the human body makes the commercial MRI contrast agent more or less toxic. For endohedral fullerenes, versatile paramagnetic ions, especially Gd, can be entrapped and consequently firmly fixed inside the carbon cage, thus endohedral fullerenes serve as an ideal alternative for a MRI contrast agent. Since the first report of applying conventional monometallofullerene Gd@C82 as a novel MRI contrast agent in 1996,5,10,316–320 extensive studies in this direction have been reported with significant progress on improving the proton relaxivity as summarized in recent reviews.4–6,10 In particular, NCFs are capable of entrapping three paramagnetic ions within the carbon cages, hence even higher proton relaxivities can be anticipated. The first attempt to apply a NCF as a new MRI contrast agent was carried out by Dorn and coworkers in 2006. Gd3N@C80 was functionalized with poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) units and then hydroxylated, affording a derivative (Gd3N@C80[DiPEG5000(OH)x]). Compared to the commercial MRI contrast agent gadodiamide, Gd3N@C80[DiPEG5000(OH)x] showed a prominently improved water solubility and biodistribution.321 As a result, the measured relaxivity r1 of Gd3N@C80[DiPEG5000(OH)x] was 102, 143, and 32 mM−1 s−1 at 0.35, 2.4, and 9.4 T, respectively, which was markedly higher than that of gadodiamide.321 Afterwards, a series of water-soluble of PEG-functionalized Gd3N@C80 complexes with variable molecular weights of PEG (350–5000 Da) were synthesized and applied in imaging studies by the same group.322 The proton relaxivities of Gd3N@C80[DiPEG(OH)x] were measured under different magnetic fields of 0.35, 2.4 and 9.4 T, respectively. The high relaxivity r1 of 237/232 Mm−1 s−1 detected for 350/750 Da PEG at a clinical-range magnetic field of 2.4 T was almost ca. 60 times higher than that of the commercially used Gd-chelate (Gd–DTPA) contrast agent. An additional study utilizing Gd3N@C80-hydrochalarone (Gd3N@C80-Rx, where R = [N(OH)(CH2CH2O)nCH3]x, n = 1, 3, 6 and x = 10–22) as the MRI contrast agent was performed by Macfarland and coworkers, indicating that hydrochalarone-6 as the optimal member of this series exhibited the high relaxivity r1 of 205 mM−1 s−1.323 In 2009, Dorn and coworkers reported another new contrast agent candidate of Gd3N@C80(OH)∼26 (CH2CH2COOM)∼16 (M = Na or H), which exhibited higher longitudinal and transverse relaxivities, with r1 and r2 values reaching 207 and 282 Mm−1 s−1, respectively, than those of Gd3+ poly(aminocarboxylate) complexes as commercial Omniscan and Magnevist.324 In 2011, Fatouros and coworkers succeeded in conjugating a hydroxylated/carboxylated Gd3N@C80, Gd3N@C80(OH)z(CH2CH2COOM)y, to the fluorescence-labeled interleukin-13 (IL-13) peptide, which was applied to target human brain tumor cells, showing targeting ability and enhanced cellular uptake compared to Gd3N@C80(OH)z(CH2CH2COOM)y alone.325
Other than homogeneous Gd3N@C80 NCF, several Gd-based MMNCFs were also developed as new MRI contrast agents in view of their higher yield compared to Gd3N@C80.326–328 For instance, two water-soluble hydroxylated derivatives of Gd/Sc MMNCFs [ScxGd3−xN@C80Om(OH)n (x = 1, 2; m ≈ 12; n ≈ 26)] were synthesized by Wang and coworkers.326 The imaging study revealed the considerable relaxivities r1 of 20.7 and 17.6 mM−1 s−1 for Sc2GdN@C80O12(OH)26 and ScGd2N@C80O12(OH)26, respectively. In 2010, Braun et al. synthesized a modular system based on GdSc2N@C80, abbreviated as “Gd-cluster@-BioShuttle”, which showed very high proton relaxivity and high signal enhancement at very low Gd concentrations compared to the commonly used contrast agents such as Gd–DTPA, resulting in an incredible 500-fold gain of sensitivity.327 Later on, Dunsch and coworkers applied this Gd-cluster@-Bioshuttle to target c-mycm RNA-expressing cells disclosing facile intracellular transport and high specificity for cells.328
In addition to C80-based NCFs, in 2014, Dorn and coworkers investigated the imaging capability of Gd3N@C84 evaluated via its water soluble derivative Gd3N@C84(OH)x. The proton relaxivities of Gd3N@C84(OH)x were measured under magnetic fields of 0.47, 1.4 and 9.4 T, respectively, revealing magnetic strength-dependent relaxivities since high relaxivities, 170 and 173 mM−1 s−1, were observed in the lowest and midfield strengths (0.47 and 1.4 T), which was significantly decreased to 63 mM−1 s−1 at high field (9.4 T).329 In comparison with previous Gd3N@C80 as well as commercial Omniscan, a higher relaxivity of Gd3N@C84 was certified under identical conditions, suggesting a drastic impact of the cage structure on relaxivity. Thus Gd3N@C84 can serve as an excellent candidate for MRI contrast agents. This result was further confirmed by an in vitro imaging study (see Fig. 21), in which the T1-weighted MR images of an aqueous solution of Gd3N@C2n(OH)x (2n = 80, 84) and Omniscan were compared, revealing an enhanced signal for both NCF derivatives and, remarkably Gd3N@C84 was much superior than Gd3N@C80 as a brighter image was observed at a similar concentration to Gd3N@C80.

In addition to the potential applications as an MRI contrast agent, endohedral fullerenes, especially NCFs, have been applied as X-ray contrast agents as well. A suitable candidate is Lu3N@C80 based on the large cross section of the lutetium (Lu) atom. In 2002 Dorn and coworkers reported the X-ray contrast ability of Lu3N@C80 when distributed onto a non-absorbing Teflon block and irradiated with X-rays, and concluded that such an X-ray contrast cannot be attributed to the carbon cage since no contrast effect was found for C60. Combining with the MRI contrastability of Gd ions discussed above, Lu-based MMNCFs, Lu3−xAxN@C80 (A = Gd or Ho, x = 0–2), may potentially serve as a multimodality contrast agent (e.g., X-ray and MRI), enabling simultaneous access to directly compare images with minimum exposure to the patient.231 Employing a similar strategy, in 2010 Dorn and co-workers introduced radiolabeled 177Lu ions into Lu3N@C80 NCF and synthesized a 177Lu-radiolabeled NCF (177LuxLu3−xN@C80), which was conjugated with a fluorescent tag [tetramethyl-6-carboxyrhodamine (TAMRA)]-labeled interleukin-13 (IL-13) peptide. Interestingly, no sign of leakage of the radiolabeled 177Lu ions from the fullerene cage after the β-decay process was observed, thus it could be used for radiotherapeutic and radiodiagnostic applications.330 In 2011, the same group reported the application of functionalized Gd3N@C80 conjugated to radiolabelled Lu chelated by tetraazacyclododecanetetraacetic acid (177Lu-DOTA-f-Gd3N@C80) in effective brachytherapy. Upon treating mice with implanted human glioblastoma cells using 177Lu-DOTA-f-Gd3N@C80, both imaging and effective therapy were achieved because Gd3N@C80 offered longitudinal tumor imaging while 177Lu-DOTA acted as a radiotherapeutic.331 The efficacy of such a NCF-based conjugate was further revealed in two orthotopicxenograft brain tumor models of glioblastomamultiforme one year later.332
In 2015, Dorn and coworkers synthesized a new amino-surface functionalized Gd3N@C80 platform, Gd3N@C80O12(OH)10(NH2)7(NO2)2 [(amino)-I]. When conjugating this new Gd-nanoplatform with an interleukin-13 (IL-13) peptide, the improved targeting of U-251 glioblastomamultiforme (GBM) cell lines was obtained. Besides, the effective targeting of orthotopic GBM xenografts in mice by intravenous delivery was observed by conjugating a Gd3N@C80 platform onto an IL-13-TAMAR peptide. The enhanced charge attraction for GBM cellular endocytosis of (amino)-I was due to the presence of positively charged amino groups (–NH3+) on the fullerene cage surface.333
5.2. Applications in energy conversion
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) have become promising renewable energy devices due to their advantages of low-cost, light-weight, high flexibility, and easy production via roll-to-roll processing. Due to their strong electron-accepting ability, fullerene derivatives have been widely used as acceptors in PSCs.334,335 Among them, [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) is the most common acceptor in state-of-the-art PSCs.336,337 Compared to empty fullerenes such as C60, by varying the composition of the entrapped species, endohedral clusterfullerenes offer a facile modulation of the molecular orbital energies, which are determinative for the open-circuit voltage of PSC devices. In 2009 Drees and coworkers applied for the first time Lu3N@C80-based PCBM-like derivatives as novel acceptors in PSCs. Utilizing 1-(3-hexoxycarbonyl)propyl-1-phenyl-[6,6]-Lu3N@C81 (Lu3N@C80-PCBH) as a novel acceptor, the authors obtained an optimized high open-circuit voltage of 890 mV, which was 260 mV above the reference devices made with the commonly used C60-PCBM acceptor (see Fig. 22). As a consequence, a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of >4% was achieved for PSC devices based on a Lu3N@C80-PCBH acceptor.338 Further investigation revealed that a better positioned LUMO level enabling more capture of the energy associated with each absorbed photon contributed to the higher PCE of the P3HT/Lu3N@C80–PCBH device.338 In a follow-up work, the same authors studied the impact of the blending ratio of Lu3N@C80-PCBH with P3HT on the active layer morphology and performance of PSC devices. They determined an optimal blending ratio of P3HT and Lu3N@C80-PCBH of 50 wt% fullerene loading, which was apparently different from that in the C60-PCBM system (one-to-one molecular equivalent weight ratio).339 The difference in the blending ratio resulted from the discrepancy of their sizes, and the relative large size of Lu3N@C80-PCBH reduced the amount of fullerene required for efficient charge transport. More promisingly, the authors proposed that a PCE greater than 10% may be feasible for PSCs by using the improved LUMO level offset of the Lu3N@C80-PCBH acceptor and combining it with other low-bandgap donor polymers.339

Photoelectrochemical cells (PECs) with a semiconductor/electrolyte junction provide an alternative route of solar energy conversion.340 Despite the superior electron-accepting ability of fullerene, so far only a few studies on fullerene-based PECs have been reported, and PEC studies based on endohedral fullerenes are even rarer.341–344 In 2013, our group reported the PEC application of the Sc3N@C80 NCF. Micron-sized hexagonal single-crystalline Sc3N@C80 rods were first prepared using a liquid–liquid interfacial precipitation (LLIP) method. A Sc3N@C80 rod-modified ITO electrode was then prepared by electrophoretic deposition, which exhibited a higher photocurrent response than that obtained by Sc3N@C80 drop-coated films. This indicated that the 1D rod structure may facilitate the efficient charge carrier transport among the rods and decrease charge recombination losses in the film.345
Constructing fullerene-based donor–acceptor conjugates is another practical route in promoting the applications of endohedral fullerenes in energy conversion.5,10 The seminal work on employing endohedral clusterfullerene as an integrative component in a donor–acceptor dyad system was carried out by Guldi and Echegoyen et al. in 2008. A ferrocenyl pyrrolidine adduct of Sc3N@Ih-C80 was synthesized as the first endohedral clusterfullerene-based covalent donor–acceptor dyad, for which photoinduced electron transfer from the ferrocene moiety to Sc3N@Ih-C80 was confirmed by time-resolved transient absorption spectroscopic characterization.307 Later on, two electron donor–acceptor dyads comprising triphenylamine (TPA) and Sc3N@C80 were synthesized by the same authors.346 In comparison with the C60 counterpart, longer lived photoinduced charge separated states and lower first reduction were observed, suggesting the superiority of Sc3N@C80 as the acceptor moiety for construction of new donor–acceptor conjugates.346 In 2011, they synthesized a new dyad composed of Sc3N@C80 and zinc tetraphenylporphyrine (Sc3N@C80-ZnP) and studied its electron transfer process.347 It was found that the lifetime of the charge-separated state varied for different types of solvents. In benzonitrile solvent, the charge recombination reaction of the long-range electron transfer system can be pushed back into the normal Marcus region with a lifetime of 2.6 μs.347
In 2012, a novel donor–acceptor conjugate was synthesized by Akasaka and Guldi et al., involving Lu3N@C80 as a donor and perylenebisimide (PDI) as an acceptor.348 A photo-induced electron transfer from the ground state of Lu3N@C80 to the excited state of PDI was detected, indicating the electron donating ability of Lu3N@C80, which was further confirmed by constructing a bilayer heterojunction solar cell device with a PDI as an electron acceptor and Lu3N@C80-PCBM as an electron donor showing a moderate efficiency of 0.054%.348 In 2013, Feng, Guldi and Akasak et al. designed and synthesized linear donor–acceptor conjugates of Lu3N@C80-PDI in a [6,6]-fulleroid fashion via a phenyl group.349 Intramolecular electron transfer occurred between Lu3N@C80 and PDI under the excited state, leading to the formation of a singlet radical ion pair state, 1[(Lu3N@C80)˙+–PDI˙−], which underwent radical ion pair intersystem crossing to generate the triplet radical ion pair state, 3[(Lu3N@C80)˙+–PDI˙−]. Strikingly, the lifetime of the triplet radical ion pair state was nearly 1000 times longer than that of the singlet radical ion pair state.
5.3. Other potential applications
Given that endohedral clusterfullerenes inherit many peculiar electronic, physical and chemical properties of conventional metallofullerenes, other potential applications predicted for conventional metallofullerenes in such fields as transistors, superconductors, ferroelectric materials, nanomemory devices and quantum computer should be foreseen.4–6,10,29–32 In particular, the so-called peapod, where fullerene is incorporated into the interior of carbon nanotubes (CNTs), provides a unique opportunity to construct novel nanocarbon hybrid materials toward extended applications in transistors by integrating the advantages of fullerenes and CNTs.350,351 In 2006, Shiozawa and coworkers prepared the first endohedral clusterfullerene-based peapod by depositing a Dy3N@C80 film onto the SWNT film followed by high temperature treatment to 450 °C for 24 h.352 The resultant Dy3N@C80@SWNT peapod structure was confirmed by TEM. The photoemission spectrum of the Dy3N@C80@SWNT peapod measured with a photon energy of 400 eV showed two prominent peak structures at binding energies of around 7 and 10 eV, which was in stark contrast to the spectrum of pristine SWNTs with broad features. Such spectrum characters were ascribed to the Dy 4f multiplets, which displayed higher atomic photoionization cross-section than that of the valence states of C and N atoms. The Dy 4f multiplet profile extracted from the 4d–4f resonant photoemission spectroscopy of Dy3N@C80@SWNTs and SWNTs was well reproduced with the atomic photoemission multiplets, 4f9 → 4f8 and 4f10 → 4f9, resulting in an estimation of 3.0 for the effective valancy of the Dy ions, which was higher than that of pristine Dy3N@C80 (2.8). Such valence changes were interpreted by the charge transfer between Dy3N@C80 and SWNTs.352 The variation of the valence state of entrapped metals was also observed in Sc3N@C80@SWNT revealed by Nakayama and coworkers in 2013.353 Encapsulation of an Sc3N@C80 molecule in a CNT led to the change of the oxidation state of the Sc atoms from +2.5 towards +3. In addition to M3N@C80 (M = Dy, Sc), currently, Er3N@C80, Gd3N@C80 and Lu3N@C80 have also been reported to be able to form peapod structures.354,355 Besides, modifying M3N@C80 (M = Gd, Lu)@SWNTs with a carboxyl group and CdSe/ZnS quantum dots enabled it as an excellent multimodal diagnostic MRI contrast agent as corroborated by in vitro and in vivo experiments. Furthermore, the possibility of encapsulating a NCF derivative, Sc3N@C80 fulleropyrrolidine, inside SWNTs was accomplished by Kaiser and coworkers, for which the intricate dynamic behavior of the functionalized Sc3N@C80 molecules at the atomic level was observed by using aberration-corrected TEM. This provided valuable information on the encapsulation mechanism of Sc3N@C80 into SWNTs.356
In 2013, Shinohara and coworkers reported a novel peapod based on Sc3C2@C80 CCF. By comparing the Sc3C2@C80-based peapod with a Pr@C82-based one, the endohedral fullerene-dependent density of state modulation of SWCNTs was unfolded.357 It was found that the relative positions of the conduction band and valence band peaks were related to the type of encapsulated endohedral fullerene, and the electrostatic potential from different electrical charge distributions of Pr@C82 and Sc3C2@C82 in SWCNTs was responsible for such variations. On the basis of endohedral fullerene-induced modulation of the band structures of SWCNTs, promising applications of endohedral fullerenes in emerging SWCNT-based transistors are eagerly anticipated.357
6. Summary and outlook
Thanks to the serendipitous finding of the Sc3N@C80 NCF in 1999, a new era of endohedral fullerene research has been opened up, making endohedral clusterfullerenes the most fast-growing and vigorous branch of fullerenes during the past three decades. This article presents a detailed overview of endohedral clusterfullerenes reported to date, spanning from their discoveries, syntheses, separations, and molecular structures to their properties and potential applications. The versatility of the carbon cages and specifically the entrapped metal clusters as well as their interplay provides incredible possibilities that may occur when metal clusters meet carbon cages.
In terms of the known atoms which are reported to form endohedral clusterfullerene structures, to date the metal atoms are quite limited to group-IIIB metals (Sc, Y, and lanthanide metals), group-IVB metals (Ti), and group-VB metals (V), while the non-metal atoms are also limited to N, C, O, and S. This largely limits the types of endohedral clusterfullerenes to only seven, including NCFs, CCFs, OCFs, SCFs, CYCFs, HCCFs and CNCFs. With a strong desire to extend the choices of endohedral clusterfullerenes toward broader applications, an open yet crucial question is whether other types of atoms, especially metal atoms, are able to form endohedral clusterfullerene structures. Of particular importance is the possibility of entrapping the d-block transition metals except the reported Ti and V into the carbon cage. Since the d-block transition metals have the strong coordination ability, their coordination with non-metal atom ligands leading to the formation of endohedral clusterfullerenes seems more feasible than that in the form of conventional metallofullerenes. On the other hand, extending the choice of the non-metal atom to other p-block elements like phosphorus (P) should be considered as an alternative route to search for novel endohedral clusterfullerenes.
The mutual stabilization of the inner metal cluster and outer fullerene cage with a specific isomeric structure brings out peculiar properties of endohedral clusterfullerenes. Among the known properties of endohedral clusterfullerenes, chemical properties are particularly important for tailoring the potential applications of endohedral clusterfullerenes, while so far the chemical functionalizations of endohedral clusterfullerenes have been less studied compared to empty fullerenes and conventional metallofullerenes, and the available reports have been predominantly focused on NCFs and CCFs. How to develop new chemical functionalization protocols of other types of endohedral clusterfullerenes remains a challenge. Besides, among the physical properties of endohedral clusterfullerenes, the magnetic properties, especially SMM behaviour, are undoubtedly most intriguing but are still in their infancy. Further mechanistic understanding of the SMM properties of endohedral clusterfullerenes is eagerly needed for optimizing the performance of such ideal molecular systems. To this end, the prerequisite is to have sufficient amounts of endohedral clusterfullerene materials available for an extended study. Therefore, it is highly desirable to develop new synthetic routes fulfilling an enhanced yield of endohedral clusterfullerenes along with the ultimate goal of selective synthesis.
With the considerable advance in the field of endohedral clusterfullerenes during almost the past two decades, optimistic solutions to the aforementioned questions and challenges leading to fundamentally new findings in this exciting field are anticipated in the near future, paving the way for the practical application of endohedral clusterfullerenes.
