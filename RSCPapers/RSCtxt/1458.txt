    , Accepted 2nd November 2021First published on 2nd November 2021AbstractThin-film solar cells constituted of abundant elements are key to ensuring mass production, reducing energy costs, and meeting energy demands. Kesterite is a cost-effective light absorber but to date has shown low compatibility with a superstrate architecture, and thus studied mostly with costly substrates. In the present study, we demonstrated that a cation substitution of Zn by Cd could improve the absorber compatibility on a superstrate architecture. Moreover, we employed all solution-processing using a water and ethanol mixture as green solvents for thin-film deposition. An increase in the Cd amount in the absorber layer led to improved crystallinity and a crystal-size increment, band gap decrement, and a change in the crystal structure from kesterite to cernyite. The composition of the buffer layer was controlled by the diffusion of Zn into CdS, forming (Cd, Zn)S with a relative Cd–Zn ratio. Solar cells prepared with high Cd showed a thicker depletion width and a reduction in the defect carrier density, leading to a significant increment in the power conversion efficiency of up to 1.9%. Furthermore, the fabricated solar cells showed high stability upon continuous light illumination of over 80 h. Investigation of the electrical losses in Cu2CdSnS4 suggested an ample opportunity to improve solar cell performance in a superstrate type architecture.
1. Introduction
The unparalleled growth in the photovoltaic (PV) market mainly relies on wafer-based silicon technology; however, this can comprise future challenges in terms of material availability and production. Alternatively, thin-film PVs are of significant interest since they have a high potential to meet the increasing energy demand.1 Thin-film PV technologies have advantages in the manufacturing processes, offering fast deposition processes for large-scale PV production, less usage of raw elements, and a low energy payback and carbon footprint.2 Furthermore, they provide good aesthetics in applications where lightweight, flexible, or semitransparency is required. These advantages are of special interest for the emerging energy applications, such as long-term powering of outdoor and indoor sensors, the internet of things, building-integrated PV, or small decentralized installations for self-consumption.3
Thin-film PV technologies depend on strategic materials with relatively low abundance, such as Te in CdTe, or In, Ga, and Se in the case of Cu(In, Ga)Se2 (CIGS), which raises doubt about their gigawatt-scale production.4 It is of paramount interest, to find suitable substitutes for these raw materials with more abundant elements. Emerging chalcogenide materials with competitive PV properties have received attention in the last decades as possible candidates to substitute the critical elements. In particular Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 (CZTS) has received special attention, due to its composition made of abundant elements, and PV performances close to the ideal direct band gap, p-type conductivity, and a moderate temperature crystallization of 500–600 °C.5 The composite CZTS thin films are compatible with various wet-chemistry processing methods, allowing them to be easily implemented in cost-effective roll-to-roll processes with high throughput. In particular, spray coating has demonstrated versatility, scalability, and PV performance,6,7 and is compatible with environmentally friendly solvents.8,9
Sincere efforts have been made to fabricate CZTS as an efficient PV material, however, its development has been limited in the last few years and the best-reported efficiency still lags behind others and was reported to be 12.6% in 2012, and 13% in 2021, still far from its Shockley–Queisser limit.10,11 Limitations in CZTS performance are found in both the interfaces and intrinsic materials properties. The low charge-carrier lifetime and interface barriers are sources of current loss,12–14 while the band gap fluctuation, non-Ohmic contacts, grain boundaries, deep defects, band misalignment with the buffer, double layer formation, and recombination by point defects and long band tailing have been identified as the reasons for the typical high voltage deficit.15–20 Most of the strategies to overcome these problems have been focused on improvements of the absorber layer by alkali doping, alloying with isoelectronic elements, passivation of the interfaces, or controlling the microstructure.
One of the promising approaches to overcome the absorber limitations has been found in the cation substitution of Zn2+ by Cd2+. Cd substitution leads to an absorber with an enlarged grain size, reduced secondary phases, avoids Cu–Zn disorder defects, and increases the minority lifetime, resulting in devices with improved PV performance and thicker depletion widths, with pure sulphide solar cells showing over 12% efficiency.21–24 The resulting alloys are compatible with wet-chemistry deposition methods; however, this raises concerns about their toxicity. Metallic and Cd-based compounds have limited large-scale applications due to their high toxicity and water solubility. Though Cd is not directly abundant in the earth's crust, it can be obtained as a by-product from Zn mining, resulting in a higher supply than demand, which makes it one of the cheapest metals.25 A stimulating approach would be to develop applications for stable and insoluble Cd compounds with reduced toxicity, along with a lower processing cost, which can reduce Cd emission to the environment, avoiding its disposal as waste.26
On the other hand, the exploitation of different PV architectures is limited rather than the standard substrate with Mo as the back contact. The substrate architecture, inherited from CIGS, presents good conductivity and stability at the required temperatures, but the uncontrolled growth of a Mo(S, Se)2 layer remains challenging to avoid and creates the issue of a non-Ohmic contact on the back surface. Moreover, this architecture is incompatible with semi-transparent or top-cell tandem applications. Alternatively, this issue can be overcome by utilizing a superstrate architecture based on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO), which is thermally stable and offers a similar low-cost manufacturing with abundant elements. However, poor compatibility has been found between FTO/TiO2 and CZTS. Various reasons have been proposed for this poor compatibility, such as a lower quality of the absorber layer, oxides formation, or a high defect density in the interface.27,28
In this work, we employed a sustainable (water–ethanol mixed) solvent to prepare the absorber thin films by spray pyrolysis, and we performed a cation substitution to evaluate the compatibility of Cu2(Cdx, Zn1−x)SnS4 (CCZTS) compounds with a superstrate architecture. Moreover, all the solar cell layers were fabricated by wet-chemistry deposition methods with environmentally benign solvents to allow cost-effective manufacturing. We found that compounds with a higher Cd content present a higher crystallinity and grain size, along with a low defects density. The Cd content of the absorber layer also affects the front contact by the elemental diffusion of Zn into the CdS, forming an FTO/TiO2/(Cd, Zn)S contact with a correlated Cd–Zn content in the absorber layer. These in turn lead to an increase in the power conversion efficiency (PCE) from almost negligible to a maximum of 1.9%. In addition, we inspected the stability of the best PV cells under various conditions without any encapsulation. The PV cells were chemically and thermally stable, while the sample with full cation substitution demonstrated the best stability under normal working conditions for more than 80 h.
2. Experimental
2.1 Solar cells fabrication
Commercial FTO (TEC-8)-coated glass was used as a substrate and front contact for the PV cells preparation. The FTO-coated glass was subjected to a cleaning procedure consisting of a 10 min immersion under ultra-sonication in four different baths of 2% Hellmanex–water solution, distilled water, acetone, and isopropanol. After a fast dry with compressed air, the samples were exposed to 15 min UV light to remove any organic residue.
The samples were preheated on a hotplate at 500 °C in the open air, and a solution containing titanium(IV) diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) (Merck) in ethanol (Scharlab) with a volume ratio of 1:19 was sprayed on the full area of the samples, producing a 60 nm TiO2 compact layer. A small area of the sample was left uncovered by the subsequent layers to be used as the front contact. TiO2 paste (18NR-T Dyesol) was dispersed in ethanol with a 125 mg mL−1 concentration. Next, 50 μL of the dispersion was spin-coated at 2000 rpm on the FTO/TiO2 substrates, followed by 30 min air annealing at 500 °C on a hotplate to produce a 150 nm TiO2 mesoporous layer.
A CdS thin-film was deposited by chemical bath deposition (CBD). The samples were immersed in a deionized water bath of 370 mL at 65 °C containing 75 mg cadmium sulphate (98%, Alfa Aesar). Then 18.2 mL of ammonia solution (30%, Alfa Aesar) was added, followed by 20 mL water solution with 200 mg thiourea (99%, Alfa Aesar). The bath was maintained at 65 °C under constant stirring, and the samples were extracted after 10 min. CdS deposited on the glass side was removed with diluted HCl.
The absorber layer was prepared by spray pyrolysis from a water–ethanol molecular solution. First, stock solutions were prepared by separately dissolving Cd(NO3)2·4H2O (98%, Merck), CuCl2, ZnCl2, and SnCl2·2H2O (98%, Alfa Aesar) in ethanol with a 0.1 M concentration, and thiourea in deionized water at a 1 M concentration. The precursor solution was prepared following the next steps. First, 3.56 mL of Cu solution was slowly added to 4 mL of thiourea solution to avoid gelling. Separately, a second solution was prepared by adding 1.976 mL of mixed Cd and Zn solutions, with variable percentage, to 2.47 mL of Sn solution, along with 300 μL HCl (37%, Fisher) to increase the stability. Both solutions were then mixed, obtaining a clear and transparent solution, and 3.7 mL deionized water was added to get a 1:1 mix of water–ethanol. It can be deduced from the scheme in Fig. 1a that all the precursor solutions were sprayed using dry air as the carrier gas on preheated samples, and clean glass substrates at the same time, on a hotplate at 340 °C in the open air. The samples were then submitted to a sulfurization process at 550 °C for 1 h inside a closed quartz tubular furnace containing 50 mg sulfur powder (99.5%, Alfa Aesar) in an argon atmosphere.

Aligned with the objectives of this work, the PV cells were completed with a robust conductive graphite paste (GST 4500) 0.2 mm thick as the back contact deposited by a doctor-blade. Graphite possesses a deep work function of ∼5 eV, which allows efficient hole extraction and the use of a low-cost material and deposition method. A vinyl mask was used to define the active area, as measured in Fig. S1 (ESI†), prepared with the help of a Roland GS-24 cutter. The FTO front contact area was exposed by scratching the TiO2 protective layer and covered with Ag paint (RS Pro). Finally, all the samples were heated at 100 °C for 10 min on a hotplate in the air to improve the graphite and Ag conductivity.
2.2 Characterizations
Electron-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) was performed with a Quantax75 equipped in a TM4000 Series scanning electron microscope (SEM). X-Ray diffractograms (XRD) were measured on the final device, without the graphite back contact, with a Cubix3 system from PANalytical with a Cu anode. SEM images were recorded with a Hitachi S-3400 electron microscope at 5 kV acceleration potential. Transmittance spectra were recorded on the finished samples with an Agilent Cary 60 UV-Vis spectrometer.
The external quantum efficiency (EQE) was measured on a PVE300 Bentham system, consisting of a 150 W Xenon lamp and a 1/4m monochromator, in the range from 300 to 1000 nm in steps of 5 nm. Capacitance–voltage (C–V) measurements were performed inside a Faraday box with a Biologic impedance analyser, applying steps for the DC voltage between 1.5 to −1.5 V and 20 mV AC perturbation of 100 kHz. Current–voltage (J–V) curves were measured with a Keithley 2400 source meter. Characterization under illumination was performed with a class AAA Oriel solar simulator from Newport, calibrated to 1 Sun (AM 1.5) irradiance. For the light stability, a Motic-MLC-150C ∼3000 K halogen lamp was used as the light source. The measurements were made with a microampere meter Keithley 6487, programmed using LabVIEW software. The program tracks the maximum power point (MPP) by the perturbation-observation method of the voltage and current, recording a measurement every second.
2.3 Simulation material energy level bands and band bending
The energy values were calculated from the material properties and are presented in Table S1 (ESI†). PC1D software was used to calculate the band structure of the materials separately, and the bending of the bands of the junctions under equilibrium conditions.
3. Results and discussion
We prepared the samples with different cation content by changing the ratio of Cd and Zn in the precursor solution. The ratio of the Cd/(Cd + Zn) content in the precursor solution was used to denote the samples as x = 0, x = 0.25, x = 0.5, x = 0.75, and x = 1. Previously, we noted that most of the Cd from the CdS layer will be diffused into the absorber layer,29 therefore, an extra substrate without CdS with x = 0 solutions was sprayed to be used as a reference for the pure Cu2ZnSnS4, denoted as CZTS. The composition of the sulfurized films was measured by EDX in both the glass and prepared substrates and we measured the ratio of Zn to Cd (Fig. 1b).
We noted a linear trend of the Cd in both substrates, suggesting that the Cd and Zn content of the precursor solution was correlated with the Cd and Zn ratio of the final film. In the case of the glass substrate, the Cd content was slightly lower than expected, which may have been due to the partial loss of Cd due to evaporation either during the spray pyrolysis and/or in the sulfurization step. This loss was compensated in the case of a CdS film, where the Cd content was higher in the final composition than in the precursor solution. Even in the case of x = 0, where the precursor solution had no Cd, the Cd content in the final film was 35% of the metal2+ content, indicating that the CdS film had an impact on the final composition of the absorber layer.
The measured compositional ratios are shown in Table S2 (ESI†). In this case, all the samples showed a copper-deficient stoichiometry, slightly below the selected ratio of the precursor solution, likely due to the contribution of the Cd from the CdS film. The Cu-deficient ratio from 0.6–0.9 is typically considered as a competitive value for the performance, owing to the reduction in the formation of highly harmful CuSx secondary phases, which causes shunts and recombination due to its high conductivity and high p-type doping.30
On the other hand, the Sn ratio was highly different from the precursor solution to the final composition. Even if a metal2+ rich composition is required to get an efficient CZTS absorber, a metal2+-poor ratio of (Cd + Zn)/Sn of 0.8 was deliberately used. Due to the higher volatility of Sn compounds, a high loss of Sn is usually reported during the synthesis of CZTS thin films, especially during the precursor decomposition in wet-chemistry methods.16,31 To compensate for the Sn loss, our precursor solution contained 25% extra Sn than the stoichiometry. A final metal2+-rich composition was obtained in all cases in the final layers, even in the CZTS sample without CdS, showing that this is an effective technique to control the Sn ratio. Arguably, in the samples, where a CdS layer was used, the metal2+ ratio was higher due to the Cd contribution from the CdS. The sulfur source used in the precursor was thiourea, in a ratio 5 times higher than the stoichiometry. During the thiourea decomposition, the excess sulfur vaporizes, creating a local area where the formation of metal–oxide secondary phases is avoided and the formation of a sulfur-rich film is favoured.32 Sulfur-rich films favour the formation of quaternary phases and, during the sulfurization step, promote better crystal growth.
The structural differences produced by the cation substitution were studied by X-ray diffractograms (Fig. 2a), in which a gradual transition from Cu2ZnSnS4 to Cu2CdSnS4 (CCTS) could be observed with the increase in the Cd to Zn ratio in the precursor, producing Cu2(Cd,Zn)SnS4 (CCZTS). The [112] peak situated at 28.65° gradually shifted to a lower angle until 28.13° for CCTS (Fig. 2b). The shift in the angle corresponds with a crystal lattice expansion due to the larger size of Cd than Zn, with an expansion in the cell volume from 313.5 Å3 to 331.4 Å3 (Table 1) determined using Bragg's law. A change in crystal symmetry from kesterite to stannite was observed in the [220] peak, where the peak started to divide into two peaks corresponding to [220] and [204] at x = 0.25, which corresponds with the samples where the Cd content was higher than Zn.33 The structure changes with a high Cd content (Fig. 2c) consisted of a stannite-like structure, as first reported in minerals such as cernyite,34 where Cd and Cu are layered, in contrast with the kesterite structure. This effect could be also noticed in the c/2a value from Table 1, where lower values are associated with stannite-like structures, and values close to 1 are more characteristic of kesterite.35 The crystallite size was estimated using the Scherrer equation from the [112] peaks and the samples showed a similar crystallite size, except for x = 0.75, which gave a higher value.

While the CZTS sample showed peaks corresponding to a pure phase, in the CCZTS samples, several peaks corresponding to the (Cdx, Zn1−x)S secondary phase could also be deduced. Considering the excess metal2+ previously detected, these peaks revealed that part of the Cd was preserved, most likely as the original CdS layer, but formed an alloy with the Zn from the precursor solution, which gradually shifted the CdS peaks to a higher angle when the Zn content in the solution was higher. This is in agreement with reported observations of Zn accumulation at the interface after high-temperature treatment.36 The final (Cdx,Zn1−x)S alloy formation may play an important role in the fabricated solar cells and will impact the electrical properties, producing a CCZTS/(Cdx, Zn1−x)S junction, rather than a CCZTS/TiO2. High conductivity is preferred for this phase to act as an upright electron-transport material and the desired properties, where CdS is superior to ZnS. As shown in Fig. 2d, the conduction band alignment of ZnS was less favourable, suggesting an extra barrier for electron extraction. Therefore we can expect that Cd-rich samples would have improved behaviour over Cd-deficient ones.
To investigate the impact of the composition on the microstructure of the absorber layer, we recorded top-view SEM images of the samples (Fig. 3a–c and Fig. S2a–c, ESI†). An increase of the crystal size can be noticed for the samples with a higher Cd content, indicating that Cd facilitated the crystallization similar to the substrate architecture. A larger crystal size along the horizontal direction has clear advantages. For instance, the area between grains has a high number of defects and unbound atoms, which reduces the conductivity and increases charge recombination. Moreover, the diffusion of unwanted elements is favoured in the inter-grains, which can result in faster degradation due to composition changes.
 Fig. 3  SEM top and cross-sectional view of the samples (a and d) x = 0.5, (b and e) x = 0.75 and (c and f) x = 1 respectively. Inset depicts the histogram distribution and average of the grain size. The films are marked as blue (FTO), green (planar TiO2), yellow (mesoporous TiO2 + (Cd, Zn)S) and red (CCZTS). 
The size distribution of the grains showed a progressive increase in the grain size, particularly notable in x = 0.75 and x = 1 samples, where the average grain size was close to the film thickness, and therefore there were fewer impediments and inter-grain recombinations through the current flow direction.
A cross-sectional SEM study (Fig. 3d, e, f and Fig. S2d, e, f, ESI†) of the samples revealed the layer structure and thickness of the samples. All the samples had a compact layer formation without visible voids. The layer stack consisted of a 600–700 nm thick FTO, a compact TiO2 layer of 30–40 nm, a fine grain mesoporous layer of TiO2 of 140–160 nm, and an active layer formed of bigger crystals 300–500 nm thick. Since the CZTS and x = 0 samples were prepared in the same batch, the difference in the thickness can be attributed to the lack of CdS, suggesting the significant contribution of CdS to the absorber layer. The advantage of using a mesoporous TiO2 layer is to improve the adhesion and to increase the contact area between the absorber and the ETL, which in combination with the high pore penetration of the CdS deposited by CBD ensures minimizing the cavities at the interface. However, the CZTS sample seemed to have small voids and cavities at the interface due to the absence of the CdS layer. Cavities are not desirable since they can block part of the current and reduce the electron–hole separation in the interface.
The optical properties of the samples were studied by measuring the transmittance in the UV–Vis region (Fig. 4a). The samples showed a high transmittance of up to 65% in the near-IR region higher than 950 nm, while the transmittance was sharply decreased for shorter wavelengths, which denoted a high absorption coefficient due to the band gap absorption for all the materials, an indispensable requirement for thin-film solar cells. Since the thickness of the absorber films was only 300–500 nm, the light was not completely absorbed, with the mild variations in the thickness the plausible reason for the differences in the transmittance at short wavelengths, in particular for the thinner samples CZTS and x = 0.25. The impact of the thickness on the transmittance can be found in Fig. S3 (ESI†). Nevertheless, the thickness of the absorber layer did not impact the PV properties due to limitations in the electrical properties.

The solar cells were finished by the deposition of a conductive graphite electrode on top of the device. The EQE spectra were measured to study the wavelength response (Fig. 4b). We noted a significant increase in the photon-to-electron conversion across the wavelengths for the devices with a higher quantity of Cd. The CZTS samples did not give a sufficient signal and were discarded for the electro-optical measurements. Since the light absorption was similar, the electrical properties of the absorber material and/or the better compatibility with the FTO/TiO2 front contact were the plausible reason for this. The shape of the EQE spectra provided an insight into the interface. A small shoulder in the region below 450 nm indicated losses in the front contact due to the parasitic absorption of the FTO and TiO2 layers. Thickness optimization of these layers could increase the short-wavelength light that reaches the absorber material and thus could improve the photon-to-electron conversion efficiency in this region. A maximum EQE was found in all the devices in the range of 450–500 nm, followed by a progressive decay of the quantum efficiency at longer wavelengths. The decrease in absorption at longer wavelengths was not sufficient to explain the loss in efficiency. We ascribed this to the carrier diffusion length since photons absorbed deeper in the absorber layer produce electron–hole pairs that have to diffuse further to reach the p–n junction where the electron–hole separation occurs.
We calculated the band gap (Fig. 4c) by linear extrapolation of the equation hνln(1 − EQE)2. For comparison, the band gaps of the different absorbers were extracted from the Tauc plot (Fig. 4d and e). The calculated results (Fig. 4f), showed the maximum difference between both values was 0.023 eV. A value of 1.5 eV was obtained for the pure CZTS sample, while all the other samples with Cd in the composition showed a reduction in the band gap, with a minimum value obtained of 1.41 eV for the x = 1 sample. However, the band gap values for this family of compounds were within the ideal values considering the Shockley–Queisser limit.
The electrical properties of the samples were studied by capacitance–voltage measurements, from which the Mott–Schottky plot was calculated (Fig. S4, ESI†) and the built-in potential (Vbi) of the junction was calculated (Fig. 5). The built-in potential indicates the voltage produced at the p–n interface, setting an upper limit for the voltage that can be extracted. Interestingly, the intermediate values of Cd–Zn in the composition resulted in a lower built-in potential, while this value increased for the pure Zn sample CZTS and for high values of Cd. However, this value alone needs to be complemented with other junction properties to give a comprehensive model. Assuming the capacitor model of the p–n junction, the depletion width is inversely proportional to the capacitance, following the equation  where W is the depletion width, ε is the dielectric constant of the absorber, ε0 is the vacuum dielectric constant, A is the cell area, and C is the capacitance. The depletion width, and therefore the capacitance, can be modified if an external voltage is applied and, at the same time, the density of free carriers ND in the absorber layer can be calculated with the equation  
 Fig. 5  (a) Carrier-density profile calculated from the C–V measurements, with the values of the built-in potential, depletion width, and carrier density under short-circuit conditions, (b) Steady-state band bending simulation of a CZTS device with high doping (1018 cm−3) and a ZnS interlayer, indicating the mayor problems, and (c) band bending of CCTS with low doping (1016 cm−3) and a CdS interlayer. 
The results and values at 0 V are presented in Fig. 5a. For samples with a low or no Cd content, a carrier density of 1017 to 1019 cm−3 was obtained, which was higher than the reported values obtained for CZTS prepared in a substrate structure, of 1016 cm−3.37 We ascribe this high carrier concentration with the presence of a higher number of inter-grain defects in the samples with a lower grain size and the defects produced in the p–n interface.
A progressive increase in the depletion width and a reduction of ND with the increase in Cd could be deduced, which correlated with the values of the EQE. This revealed that the main current limitation for the samples with a low Cd ratio was a small depletion width, thus drastically reducing the electron–hole pair collection, along with the high density of carriers associated with the trap states, which decreased the diffusion length. The increase of Vbi while the carrier density decreased suggests that the carriers were dominated by trap states in the samples with an intermediate Cd–Zn content. A high Cd ratio was found to overcome this limitation while increasing the built-in potential, which resulted in a higher charge collection with a higher potential separation.
The obtained values were used to simulate band bending on the two extreme cases of CZTS/ZnS/TiO2 (Fig. 5b) and CCTS/CdS/TiO2 (Fig. 5c). This supports our hypothesis that there is a metal2+ accumulation at the interface, inhibiting a direct junction being formed between the TiO2 and the absorber layer (Fig. S5, ESI†). In agreement with the C–V measurements, we noted that the bending was produced in a much smaller region when the doping increased. ZnS-like interfaces produce a barrier for the carrier collection, stimulating the interface recombination.
The dark I–V curve was measured (Fig. 6a) and all the samples presented a rectification shape, with no leakage under reverse current. The samples with a higher Cd ratio presented an increase in the turn-on voltage, which suggested the existence of a barrier affecting the output voltage was low in Cd samples since the built-in potential followed a different trend. These barriers were likely produced at the p–n interface due to band bending, caused by the high charge density in the p-type absorber. In addition, barriers can be also produced in the grain boundaries of the polycrystalline absorber, thus the samples with higher crystallinity can mitigate this problem.

The characteristic J–V curve under 1 Sun (AM 1.5) illumination is represented in Fig. 6b, and the statistical distribution of the PV properties, over 10 individual devices for each condition (except for the CZTS sample due to the low values), is shown in Fig. 6c–f. The open-circuit voltage (VOC) showed an increasing trend for the samples with a higher Cd content, especially for the samples x = 0.75 and x = 1, where it reached a value of 540 mV, while the best value of sample x = 0.5 was just 402 mV. This increment seems to be highly correlated with the increase in the built-in potential, which allows for efficient charge separation, and a reduction of the defects density, reducing the traps states and recombination and allowing the separated charges to retain a higher potential. The remaining (Cd,Zn)S as a secondary phase found in the XRD played an important role in the VOC increment. CdS is a well-known buffer material, with low resistance and high n-type doping, while ZnS usually presents high resistance and low n-type doping, producing barriers that make charge separation difficult. However, it has been reported that (Cd,Zn)S can reduce the interface recombination and produce solar cells with better performance.38,39 The short-circuit current (JSC) values naturally followed a similar trend as in the EQE and the thickness of the depletion width. In this case, sample x = 0.75 stood out with better values, followed by the x = 1 sample. A high Cd content improves the charge collection; however, the short-circuit current values were still below the ideal values that can be attained with these materials (up to 34 mA cm−2 for a 1.4 eV band gap according to the Shockley–Queisser limit). The low fill factor was of concern (being between 25% and 30% in most cases). Direct shunts were not observed in the dark, but internal shunts appeared to produce a low shunt resistance under illumination. We attributed this to an insufficient exciton lifetime along with the reduction of the depletion width with the voltage, thereby producing an apparent shunt. Also, a slight S shape could be noted in some samples, which suggests the presence of a barrier for the carrier collection, and the existence of parasitic resistance, most likely due to the non-optimized front and back contacts. Improvements in the interfaces and the absorber layer properties would be necessary to increase the FF.
Comparing devices with the same composition but with different absorber thicknesses (Fig. S6, ESI†), we noted a change in the initial PV performance. Moreover, a reduction of the PV parameters for absorbers thicker than 500 nm corroborated the strong limitation existing in the diffusion length and conductivity within the bulk material.
Taking all this into account, the overall power conversion efficiency (PCE) was found to show a clear improvement for the device with the higher Cd content, with remarkable record values of 1.9% for x = 0.75 and 1.4% for x = 1. Considering that this was the first time, to the best of our knowledge, that CCTS has been reportedly used in a superstrate architecture, these PCE values are promising. Moreover, the results gave good reproducibility, with a maximum dispersion of 30% among the different samples.
While the PCE extracted from the J–V curve is the standard parameter to compare with other PV technologies, it is not an important parameter to evaluate the potential of a PV technology to substitute the current PV technologies. Reliability is a critical factor when a new PV technology has to compete with established technologies. Thus, we focused on the three main stability aspects: chemical, thermal, and light stability. In the context of chemical stability, we noted that the samples had low or unnoticeable changes when exposed to common solvents (water, acetone, isopropanol, and ethanol), or even highly basic and acid environments, such as the NH3 vapours typically used in the CBD process, or concentrated HCl, in agreement with other reports for this type of solar cells.40 A high chemical stability is not only beneficial for maintaining a constant PCE over time but also for ensuring that potentially dangerous elements, such as Cd, are not released to the environment.
We then investigated the thermal stability by applying a heat treatment to the samples of 150 °C for 10 min on a hot plate (Fig. S6, ESI†). The device PV parameters decreased after heat treatment, which affected mainly the VOC and JSC. However, after keeping the samples in the dark for 2 weeks, all the PV parameters recovered to their original values. This temporal behaviour suggests that the effect of the temperature in these samples was not due to chemical reactions, such as oxidation or decomposition, but rather to a trap state activation in the p–n junction. Proper control of the trap states, by an appropriate dopant, for example, could mitigate this and increase the temperature stability.
Subsequently, the light stability was probed by monitoring the maximum power point (MPP) under continuous illumination for several hours (Fig. 7). Since the illumination was provided with a halogen lamp, the intensity was calibrated with reference cells, by adjusting the initial JSC to the value measured under 1 Sun. The comparison of the J–V curves at 1 Sun (Fig. S7, ESI†) was made to test the samples in a close-to-real application scenario. We compared the conditions for x = 0.75 and x = 1, and noted different behaviours. The sample x = 0.75 showed a decreasing trend for the MPP voltage during the first 5 h, followed by a drop in the voltage, which elevated the current. This behaviour could be caused by the creation of shunt paths due to micro dielectric breakdowns. At this point, the voltage kept almost kept, while the photo-current showed a decrement until it stabilized after 40 h. As previously seen, the short-circuit current was mostly dependent on the depletion width, which suggested that this current reduction was caused by the slow activation of traps, which increased the density of free carriers in the absorber, thus reducing the depletion width and therefore the collected charges. For the sample x = 1, we found a progressive increase in the MPP during the first 20 h, and then, a stabilized behaviour in the investigated window of 60 h. The difference between the samples indicated that the small quantity of Zn in the sample x = 0.75 had an impact on the light stability. CdS is known to exhibit high photoconductivity under visible illumination,41 lowering the resistance and improving its properties as a buffer layer, which causes an increase in the PCE. However, this effect is much lower or even disappears in a (Cd,Zn)S solid solution,42 explaining why only the x = 1 sample, which contained pure CdS, presented an increase in the PCE under continuous illumination.
 Fig. 7  (a) PCE evolution under continuous illumination for the samples x = 0.75 and (c) x = 1, (b) values of voltage and current measured at the tracked maximum power point for the samples x = 0.75 and d) x =1. 
Such findings suggest that CCTS is an attractive absorber material for the development of a new generation of stable, thin films and cost-effective PV technology based on a superstrate architecture, while CCZTS could also be a candidate if the light stability issues could be addressed. We identified the limiting factors that could be addressed to improve the PCE. The main limitation was found to be in the charge collection, which affects the short-circuit current and FF. The charge-collection dependence on the depletion width instead of the absorber thickness indicated that the limitation came from the low diffusion length of the photo-generated electron–hole pairs. Rational control of the composition and growth mechanism of the absorber layer could be key to further improving the exciton lifetime, and avoiding the formation of deep defects in the surface.43 Strategies such as doping, alloying, or nanostructures could also help to address such limitations. Additionally, optimization of both the front and back contacts could reduce the series resistance and improve the FF.
4. Conclusions
Water–ethanol spray pyrolysis deposition used as a benign media to prepare Cu2(Cdx,Zn1−x)SnS4 films as light absorber material in all-solution-processed superstrate-type solar cells. The Zn–Cd ratio was found to impact the electro-optical properties. A high Cd content improved the crystal growth and avoided the formation of (Cdx,Zn1−x)S at the interface, largely increasing the depletion width of the p–n junction and thus the photogenerated charge collection. Also, both the VOC and JSC increased significantly, leading to PCE values from 0.3% for low Cd content films to 1.9% for higher ones. The fabricated solar cells also showed chemical, thermal, and light stability, suggesting good potential for large-scale applications. The main limitations were found to be the low exciton diffusion, thus impeding a complete charge collection, and the low FF. Overcoming these limitations could promote this type of solar cell as a green and cost-effective alternative to the current PV technologies and, concurrently, avoid the use of critical or scarce elements.
