    , Accepted 27th October 2020First published on 27th October 2020AbstractQuantum dot-sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs) have emerged as an attractive area of research, enabling the construction of efficient third-generation photoelectrochemical solar cells with a higher theoretical photon conversion efficiency of up to 44%. The power conversion efficiency (η) rates of several QDSSCs are lower than those of dye-sensitized solar cells, reaching a maximum of 13.4%; meanwhile, the major drawbacks of QDSSCs are their narrow absorption range and the recombination of charge carriers occurring at the QD- and TiO2-electrolyte interfaces. Tailoring the band structure is an efficient pathway to facilitate charge carrier transportation, which in turn enhances light absorption and reduces charge carrier recombination. Doping/modifying the electron transport layer (ETL), namely TiO2, with rare earth elements has been proved to enhance the catalytic activity. Here, we report the investigation of incorporation of La3+ into TiO2 to tailor its band structure and physical characteristics of ETL; this remarkably enhanced the photon conversion efficiency (PCE) of the La–TiO2 photoanode to 3.28%, with a charge transfer resistance of 452.21 Ohm, in contrast to the PCE of TiO2 (0.87%). The study indicates successful incorporation of La3+, oxygen vacancies, efficient charge carrier separation, band gap reduction, favorable band gap alignment for effective electron transfer, a broad visible light absorption range, reduced particle size and enhanced surface area in the rare earth element-doped nanostructured titania. The obtained characteristics of the La-doped TiO2 were exploited as an ETL in QDSSCs to boost their photovoltaic performance.
1. Introduction
Global warming and its associated climate change due to extreme use of fossil fuels have led researchers to focus on production of renewable energy for the future.1–3 Photovoltaic (PV) technology, which exploits solar energy, has attracted great attention as a solution to the growing energy demand.4,5 The sun generates a significant quantity of energy for our planet, and the energy provided by the sun is roughly 10000 times higher than the global energy demand (i.e., 31024 J year−1).6 In other words, covering the Earth's surface with solar cells that produce 10% PCE would fulfill our current needs.5 QDSSCs have received extensive attention in current years as an alternative way to harvest sunlight for energy conversion due to their higher theoretical photon energy conversion efficiency and lower production costs. QDSSCs are efficient energy devices with unique qualities, including (i) generation of electron–hole pairs through harvesting solar energy and (ii) uncomplicated fabrication and cost-effectiveness. The power conversion efficiency (η) rates of several QDSSCs are lower than those of dye-sensitized solar cells, reaching a maximum of 16.6%;7 meanwhile, the major drawbacks of QDSSCs are their narrow absorption ranges and the recombination of charge carriers occurring at the QD- and TiO2-electrolyte interfaces.8 In addition, QDs show exclusive properties such as size dependency, high molar extinction coefficients, multiple exciton generation and photostability. Multiple-exciton generation, theoretically known as the inverse Auger effect, contributes to the higher PCE (η) of QDSSCs than of DSSCs.9 Conversely, recent research trends have revealed that the overall conversion efficiency of QDSSCs is lower because of electron loss due to charge carrier recombination at the electrolyte–electrode or electrolyte–counter electrode interface.10 Cadmium chalcogenide (CdX, X = S, Se or Te)-based QDSSCs have been shown to be prominent candidates, which is attributed to their high performance, cost-effectiveness and simple fabrication techniques.
A QDSSC device consists of a photoanode, counter electrode and electrolyte material. The photoanode of a QDSSC consists of an oxide semiconductor, particularly TiO2, which acts as a support for QD loading and is also a charge transport medium with higher stability under visible light illumination. Conversely, TiO2 with a wide band gap absorbs in the ultraviolet region; this results in low utilization efficiency of solar energy because UV light comprises less than 5% of sunlight radiation. Thus, it is necessary to expand the photoresponse of TiO2 to the visible spectrum through modification of its optoelectronic properties. To effectively use the full spectrum of solar light, modification of TiO2 through doping with metal and non-metal elements is shown to be a significant approach to tune the electronic properties of TiO2. In particular, doping of TiO2 with rare earth elements has attracted much interest due to their unique spectral characteristics and electronic configurations.11–13 The excellent electronic structure of lanthanide (Ln) ions (4fx, 5dy), consisting of a redox couple of Lnn+/Ln(n−1)+, is capable of forming exceedingly mobile labile oxygen vacancies and creating impurity energy levels (IELs), therefore broadening the conduction band (CB) or valence band (VB); this results in dissimilar optical properties and different catalytic properties. The broader range of the solar spectrum can be effectively utilized through the formation of intermediate bands (IBs) created by IELs by allowing low-energy photons to excite electrons from the VB to the CB. This improves the photocurrent intensity of Lnn+-TiO2 considerably. Furthermore, replacement of Ti4+ by Lnn+ inside the octahedral interstitial sites is proposed to create an unhinged charge. Hence, the charge imbalance and Ti–O–Ln bonds are anticipated to change the chemical state of the Lnn+-TiO2 surface greatly.14 Additionally, lanthanide doping reduces the electron–hole recombination by trapping and detrapping of electrons, thus extending the electron lifetime, and the flat-band potential of the conduction band of TiO2 shifts negatively due to the doping. The reduced charge carrier recombination can favorably influence the density of electrons, resulting in improved Jsc in QDSSCs. In particular, interest in lanthanum doping has increased rapidly because it will plunder oxygen in TiO2, attributed to the stronger chemical bond strength of La–O than of Ti–O. Literature reports that La doping decreases the particle size of TiO2,15 improves its thermal stability16 and enhances the amount of oxygen vacancies on the TiO2 surface.15 La dopant can increase the stability of anatase phase and inhibit the crystal growth in the high temperature synthesis process. Gao et al. prepared La–TiO2 through a solvothermal process and observed an increase in the Fermi level of TiO2 through scavenging oxygen and inducing vacancies. The PCE for perovskite solar cells is enhanced by 3.3% after doping with La.17 Jiang et al. reported an enhancement of PCE for DSSC by 0.56% in the La-doped TiO2, attributed to the increase of the dye absorption amount and electron lifetimes.18 Sadhu et al. reported an enhancement of PCE for DSSC by 0.3% in La-doped TiO2, attributed to the negative shift of the flat-band potential and improved charge carrier density.19 Li et al. showed an increment in PCE of 2.2% in La–TiO2 perovskite solar cells due to improvement of the charge transfer and the photostability of solar cells.20 Therefore, lanthanum-doped TiO2 may act as an ideal photoanode material for QDSSCs as well. To the best of our knowledge, research of lanthanum-doped TiO2 for application in QDSSCs has not been greatly explored. Therefore, it would be highly desirable to research the effects of lanthanum-doped TiO2 for application in QDSSCs.
2. Experimental
2.1 Photocatalyst preparation
The photocatalysts were synthesized as reported in our earlier article.21 Briefly, TiO2 was prepared through a co-precipitation method using titanium(IV) isopropoxide (Aldrich) as a titanium source followed by addition of 15 mL of water and stirred for 5 hours at 95 °C, which produced a white gelatinous solution. After stirring for 5 h, the pH was maintained at 9 using NaOH to precipitate the material, followed by filtering and drying the material for 3 hours in an oven. Then, the prepared material was calcined at 580 °C for 6 h to acquire anatase phase TiO2. La-doped TiO2 was prepared using a similar procedure with the addition of a designated concentration (1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 mol%) of LaO2 (Lobachemie).
2.2 Fabrication of TiO2 (La–TiO2)/CdS/ZnS QDSSCs
TiO2 or La–TiO2 paste was synthesized by mixing 0.25 g of the material (TiO2 or La–TiO2) with 0.5 mL of acetic acid and a 1:1 (10 mL) mixture of ethanol and deionized water followed by addition of Triton-X (0.2 mL); the ensuing mixture was then ground for 30 min. Prior to the deposition of the paste, the fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass was ultrasonically cleaned with surfactant, deionized water, acetone and ethanol. The paste was casted on the FTO glass substrate through the doctor blade technique and sintered at 450 °C for 30 min. Successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction processes were used to deposit CdS QDs on the surface of the TiO2/La–TiO2 films with eight cycles using a 0.02 M solution of Cd(NO3)2 in ethanol and a 0.02 M solution of Na2S in methanol as the cationic and anionic solutions, respectively. Three ZnS blocking layers were also deposited by the SILAR method using Zn(NO3)2 and Na2S as the cationic and the anionic solutions, respectively.
2.3 Preparation of CuS counter electrode
The commercially obtained CuS was sonicated with ethanol for one hour and drop-casted over FTO, followed by drying at 80 °C. The electrolyte utilized in the present research was freshly prepared polysulfide solution, which was prepared by dissolving 1 M sulfur and 1 M sodium sulfide in a 7:3 solution of methanol and deionized water. The device was assembled into a sandwich-type device with scotch tape placed between the QDs-sensitized photoanode and the counter electrode.
2.4 Characterizations
Powder X-ray diffraction patterns were recorded for phase identification using a Rigaku Ultima IV powder X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (secondary graphite monochromator) at a scan rate of 1° min−1. The crystallite sizes and lattice parameters were calculated using the Scherrer equation Dhkl = Kλ/βcosθ, where Dhkl = the dimension in Å, λ = the wavelength of X-ray radiation, β = broadening of the diffraction line measured at half maximum intensity, θ = Bragg angle and k = 1 for spherical particles. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) images were obtained by a JEOL JSM-7100F field emission microscope using an acceleration voltage of 30 kV. Energy-dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX) was used in conjunction with scanning electron microscopy to study the surface morphology and to detect the elements in the prepared samples. The absorption spectra were recorded by a Shimadzu 1800 PC UV-visible spectrophotometer for nanomolar suspensions of the catalysts, and the samples were prepared by ball milling to avoid reflection of light as much as possible. Photoluminescence (PL) experiments were performed on a Shimadzu RF 5301 PC spectrofluorometer. The specific surface areas of the catalysts were determined by the N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms recorded on a BELSORP max (Japan) at 77 K, and the pore volumes were calculated by the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method. A VG Scientific FSCA MK II spectrometer was used to record the X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) of the NPs in fixed analyzer transmission mode with a pass energy of 20 eV using Mg Kα radiation (hv = 1253.6 eV). The band-gap narrowing and absorptions of the nanomaterials were studied by a Shimadzu 1700PC UV-visible spectrometer. Electrochemical impedance spectra were measured using a CHI660D potentiostat (CH Instruments, Austin, Texas). The photovoltaic performance of the QDSSCs was measured by an integrated I–V Test station (PVIV-211 V) with a Keithley 220 source meter and 94023A Oriel Sol3A, class AAA Solar Simulator (power output: 100 mW cm−2, lamp power: 450 W).
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Photoanode characterizations
The crystalline phases of TiO2 and La–TiO2 were confirmed by XRD analysis, as depicted in Fig. 1. The XRD patterns exhibit tetragonal structure of anatase phase (JCPDS 84-1286), which is appropriate for QDSSCs. There is no presence of new phase after doping; thus, the presence of impurity phases such as La2O3 or La2Ti2O7 can be ruled out. The width of the obtained XRD diffraction peaks broadened after La3+ doping, signifying a systematic decrease in the crystal size.22 The intensity of the (101) diffraction peak decreased significantly after doping with lanthanum; this may be due to peak broadening, lattice distortion, strain, or a difference in the atomic scattering factor.23 The lattice parameters a, b, c and the unit cell volume increased with increasing La doping, as depicted in Table 1a. The enhancement in the lattice parameter values can be attributed to the large ionic radii of La3+ (1.061 Å) compared to TiO2 (0.68 Å), which leads to expansion of the unit cell volume.24 This confirms the incorporation of La3+ into the lattice of TiO2. However, the crystallite size calculated according to Scherrer's equation confirms the decrease in size after dopant incorporation from 15.5 to 8.1 nm (Table 1b), which can be ascribed to crystal grain growth hindrance due to the presence of lanthanum, and these results are in agreement with the decreased particle size as obtained from FESEM.25

Fig. 2 presents the surface morphology images of TiO2 and 4% La–TiO2. Fig. 2a shows the morphology of TiO2 nanoparticles with uneven, highly agglomerated and non-uniform particles with sizes averaging around 83 nm. Fig. 2b depicts the morphology of 4% La–TiO2, which shows a significant change in morphology into extremely small nanoparticles with spherical shapes, attributed to La doping with an average size of 25 nm. The decrease in grain size by doping with lanthanum is due to inhibition of grain growth; this is attributed to the different sizes of the dopant radii atom, which causes strain or stress that disturbs the grain growth process.26Fig. 2c–f shows 1%, 2%, 3% and 5% La–TiO2. 1% La–TiO2 depicts spherical particles similar in size to TiO2, indicating that there is no significant influence of La dopant on TiO2. The 2% and 3% La–TiO2 morphology resembles 4% La–TiO2, with a smaller particle size than TiO2, and 5% La–TiO2 presents agglomerated bundles of spherical particles, possibly due to the higher concentration of lanthanum. The SEM images of La–TiO2/CdS/ZnS and TiO2/CdS/ZnS are depicted in Fig. S4 (ESI†). The SEM image of La–TiO2/CdS/ZnS shows very small, spherical agglomerated particles, and TiO2/CdS/ZnS presents larger spherical particles. Furthermore, the SEM analysis does not show any significant difference after CdS/ZnS coating, possibly due to the thinner layers of deposited CdS and ZnS.

Fig. 3 shows the elemental composition of La–TiO2 analyzed by EDX, and Fig. S3 (ESI†) depicts the EDX mapping images of the 4% La-doped material. The EDX analysis illustrates the presence of Ti, O and La elements in the doped material, which are on par with the dopant concentrations used for the synthesis (Table S1, ESI†). Furthermore, the EDX analysis confirms the presence of Cd, Zn, and S in La–TiO2, as represented in Fig. S5 and Table S2 (ESI†). The mapping analysis represents the homogeneous distribution of lanthanum dopant on the surface of TiO2. Fig. S2 (ESI†) represents the UV-visible absorption spectra of TiO2 and 4% La–TiO2. It also induces a shift of the absorption band towards a longer wavelength, with a decrease in the band gap from 3.2 eV of TiO2 to 2.8 eV in La–TiO2, as mentioned in Fig. S2b (ESI†). The shift of the absorption edge can be ascribed to formation of impurity levels within the TiO2 band gap due to doping of the rare earth element lanthanum. The dopant may induce oxygen vacancies during synthesis. Additionally, literature reports indicate that La3+ forms inter bands below the CB level of TiO2, leading to narrowing of the band gap, which results in extension of the absorption of light towards the visible light range.18 Additionally, the band edge position of La–TiO2 was calculated according to the empirical formula EVBM = X − Ee + 0.5Eg; ECBM = EVBM + Eg, which demonstrated that the ECBM and EVBM are located at more negative values in comparison to those of the pristine TiO2 (Fig. 4(c) and (d)).

Fig. S6 (ESI†) depicts the textural properties of TiO2 and 4% La–TiO2, analyzed through Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms (Table S3, ESI†). Both the materials present type IV adsorption isotherms with H3-hysteresis loops, which suggest mesoporous structures and irreversible desorption.27 The doping of lanthanum into TiO2 considerably increases the surface area, accredited to the existence of La3+, Ti3+, and enhanced defect levels, mismatch of the radii of the dopant ion and native ion, and the surface roughness.28 4% LaTiO2 shows an improved surface area of 97.246 m2 g−1 along with enhanced pore volume, resulting in increased active sites for photocatalysis. The increased active sites after lanthanum doping can be attributed to the reduction of grain growth by La doping.29,30 The average pore sizes were measured through the BJH method; the results depict tri-distribution for TiO2 at 4, 8 and 14 nm and tetra distribution for LaTiO2 at 6, 8, 12 and 21 nm, with a higher pore diameter observed in 4% LaTiO2. The enhanced surface area, pore size and pore diameter improve the adsorption of the QDs, which in turn increases the light absorption and electron density, leading to improved PCE in doped TiO2 compared to undoped TiO2.

Fig. 4 illustrates the XPS analysis of La-doped TiO2; in order to substantiate the presence of La as a dopant in TiO2, the XPS survey and core level spectra of Ti 2p, O 1s and La 3d were measured. Fig. 4a shows the binding energy peaks at 459.3 and 464.6 eV, which represent Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2 spin orbital splitting photoelectrons, respectively; this confirms the presence of Ti4+. The peak at 457.6 represents the trivalent state of Ti, substantiating the existence of oxygen vacancies after doping of La by reduction of Ti4+ to Ti3+.12 Furthermore, the change in the oxidization state from Ti4+ to Ti3+ after incorporation of the dopant in the lattice induces oxygen vacancies, which also contributes to the reduced crystallite size. The La3+ doped into the TiO2 surface will remove oxygen from TiO2 and form oxygen vacancies more readily because the chemical bond strength of La–O (799 kJ mol−1) is stronger than that of Ti–O (662 kJ mol−1). The bare TiO2 shows higher Ti 2p binding energy peaks at 459.5 and 465.3 eV, as shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). The binding energies shifted slightly to lower binding energy values in the doped nanostructured material, signifying that a few La3+ sites were replaced by Ti4+ sites and exhibiting a strong interaction with TiO2; this substantiates the doping of La into TiO2.31Fig. 4b depicts the O 1s core level spectrum at 530.5 eV, which is attributed to lattice oxygen (Ti–O bond) (OL), and bare TiO2 shows a higher binding energy peak at 530.7 eV. The peak at 532.4 eV can be ascribed to surface hydroxyl groups (O–H bonds) or adsorbed OH− on the TiO2 surface (OS), and the peak at 528.9 eV was attributed to the La–O bond.32 The peak area of the surface oxygen increased with La-doping (1/0.758) (OL/Os) compared to that of bare TiO2 (1/0.33). The increase in the area of surface oxygen suggests the formation of oxygen vacancies in the lattice, substantiating the generation of oxygen vacancies.33 The higher resolution XPS spectrum of the La 3d core level is shown in Fig. 4c, which shows splitting of the spin orbitals of 3d5/2, 3d3/2 at around 834.6 and 852.4 eV; this confirms the presence of lanthanum as La3+ and agrees with literature data. The shift of La 3d5/2 (834.3 eV) to a lower binding energy compared with the binding energy of La2O3 (835.2 eV) indicates that La exists in the form of Ti–O–La.31 Hence, the XPS spectrum shows that La exists in the form of Ti–O–La.34Fig. 6d shows the wide scan spectrum of La–TiO2, representing the existence of Ti, O and La elements.35
3.2 Photovoltaic characterization and performance
The electrochemical performance was analyzed by plotting the photocurrent density (Jsc) versus the photovoltage (Voc) curves of QDSSCs consisting of TiO2, 1%, 2%, 3%, 4% and 5% La–TiO2/CdS/ZnS as the photoanode and CuS as the counter electrode in the presence of polysulfide as an electrolyte, as depicted in Fig. 5. The J–V curves of the TiO2 and La–TiO2 QDSSCs were measured in standard conditions (100 mW cm−2, AM 1.5G) under 1 sun illumination, as depicted in Fig. 5. The detailed photovoltaic parameters, including the short-circuit current density (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc), fill-factor (FF) and photovoltaic conversion efficiency (η), are summarized in Table 2. The data in Fig. 5 and Table 2 suggest that a nearly threefold enhancement of the photocurrent originating from the 4% La–TiO2 configuration (Jsc = 6.496 mA cm−2) was noted as compared to the TiO2 (Jsc = 1.09 mA cm−2). The enhanced photocurrent observed in the lanthanum-doped TiO2 was attributed to the doping of the rare earth element lanthanum, which reduces the recombination by the formation of defects such as Ti3+ and oxygen vacancies; this leads to higher availability of electrons and results in improved photocurrent, as shown in Scheme 1. In addition to the effect of the photoresponse due to the increased oxygen vacancies on the photoelectric performance, the increased Jsc may also be caused by the increased amount of QDs absorbed on the doped material, with more active sites and increased oxygen vacancies. The absorption of QDs on CdS slightly increased with La-doping, as depicted in the UV-absorption spectra (Fig. S7, ESI†), which shows enhanced absorption intensity along with a red-shift in La–TiO2 in comparison to bare-TiO2; this is attributed to a higher concentration of CdS in La–TiO2. However, when the dopant concentration is increased to 5 mol%, the PCE decreases because the amount of QDs adsorbed on the surface decreases, induced by the excessive doping.20 The Voc decreased in 1% La–TiO2 and subsequently maintained a stabilized value, and additionally, FF decreased after modification of La into TiO2; this can be ascribed to the formation of Ti–O–La bonds after doping into the TiO2 lattice, which increased the disorder of the lattice structure and resulted in the trap states. Therefore, the enhanced performance mainly depends on the Jsc changes.18

 Scheme 1  Mechanism of electron transfer in the La–TiO2 ETL/CdS/ZnS QDSSCs. 
We employed electron impedance spectroscopy (EIS) to investigate the factors responsible for the difference in PCE, as shown in Fig. 6. The semicircle reveals the spectra recorded in the intermediate frequency region, which illustrates the resistance offered to recombination of electrons in the TiO2/QDs/electrolyte interface. The obtained chemical capacitance (Cμ), recombination resistance (Rr), Ohmic serial resistance (Rs), and electron lifetime (Tn = Rr × Cμ)36 determined from EIS are shown in Table 3. The results show that the value of Rr of 4% La–TiO2 increased significantly (1009.78 Ohm) compared to that of the TiO2 solar cells (426.05 Ohm). In view of the increase of Rr, the electrons are difficult to recombine with the holes of the electrolyte, which results in a decrease of the charge recombination.37 Although it is very difficult to determine the intrinsic cause of the increase of Rr, we believe a possible reason is the relatively improved electron transport in La–TiO2.38 This improvement can reduce the accumulation of injected electrons and decrease the recombination.39 La dopants can induce oxygen vacancies on the surface of TiO2 grains, and these oxygen vacancies can trap electrons; this inhibits the recombination between electrons and holes.15 The photocurrent of solar cells is related to the quantum efficiency; therefore, the incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) of the devices was measured, as shown in Fig. 7. The IPCE data show enhanced internal quantum efficiency in the optimized 4% La–TiO2, and the trend of the IPCE value is in accordance with the photocurrent density in Fig. 7. The IQE increased from 20.12% in TiO2 to 47.47% in 4% La–TiO2 at 350 nm and from 19.26% in TiO2 to 42.32% in 4% La–TiO2 at 450 nm; this is attributed to the higher photon absorption due to the improved adsorption of the CdS QDs on the nanostructured material, which is ascribed to the higher surface area as substantiated by BET analysis.

4. Conclusion
Optimized lanthanum-doped TiO2 was obtained by a simple co-precipitation method and has been successfully introduced as an ETL for QDSSCs. The La doping enhances the specific surface area, leading to improved adsorption of the QDs in comparison to bare TiO2, and the positive arrangement of energy levels leads to an improved rate of electron injection and electron mobility, leading to enhanced electron density (which increases with the dopant concentration) and improved Jsc. The lanthanum induction generates oxygen vacancies with the formation of inter bands, leading to the occurrence of Ti3+ as substantiated by XPS. The optimized 4% La–TiO2 shows nearly threefold enhancement in the photocurrent compared to bare TiO2. The photon-to-electron conversion efficiency data illustrate improved absorption of light in doped TiO2 compared to bare TiO2, attributed to the increased specific surface area in La–TiO2; this was evidenced by UV and IPCE spectra. This study indicates the significance of the utilization of lanthanum as a dopant material for enhanced optical and electrical properties of TiO2 as a photoanode material for QDSSCs.
