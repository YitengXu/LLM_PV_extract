    , Accepted 29th May 2022First published on 6th July 2022AbstractEnd-group modification of non-fullerene acceptors is an effective means of optimizing the device performance of organic solar cells (OSCs). Here, we design and synthesize two isomeric terminal groups which simultaneously carry an electron-withdrawing fluoro group and an electron-donating phenoxy group. The introduction of a phenoxy group decreases the planarity of the terminal unit, enhances the solubility of acceptors and elevates the energy levels of acceptors. In addition, we find that the substituent position of the phenoxy group of the terminal unit can affect the packing behavior of the acceptors and the morphology of the blend films, thereby affecting the photovoltaic performance of the device. The optimized PBDB-T:Y-G42-based OSCs give a PCE of 15.24%, which is much higher than that of the devices based on PBDB-T:Y-G41 (12.12%) and PBDB-T:Y-F (12.53%). Our results demonstrate that the introduction of bulky substituents to the terminal unit is an effective means of tuning the solubility of NFAs and the morphology of blend films, and ultimately regulating the performance of OSCs.
Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) have attracted widespread attention because of their merits of being low cost, lightweight, semi-transparent and having the potential for large-scale printing production.1–14 Nowadays, non-fullerene electron acceptors (NFAs) have gradually replaced the previously more dominant fullerene acceptors due to their enhanced absorption in the visible and even near-infrared (NIR) region, their tunable energy levels, better device stability, and easy synthesis and purification.15–26 Recently, with the development of NFAs, power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of around 19% have been achieved in single-junction devices, demonstrating a bright future for their practical applications.27–31
Commonly used high-performance NFAs usually possess A–D–A- or A–DAD–A-type structures composed of a fused ring core and two electron-withdrawing terminal units. To ensure that the acceptor molecules are soluble in the processing solvent, electron-insulating bulky side chains are usually attached to the fused ring core,32–40 which can decrease the π–π stacking and the crystallinity of the acceptors, sometimes leading to an amorphous film morphology and a low electron mobility.41–44 We introduced the three-dimensional shape-persistent norbornyl-modified 1,1-dicyanomethylene-3-indanone (IC) terminal group to the acceptor molecules and found that such a bulky terminal group could markedly enhance the solubility of the acceptor molecules, optimize the morphology of the blend film, and decrease the non-radiative voltage loss.45–47
Furthermore, isomerization is an effective approach for fine-tuning the photovoltaic properties of organic solar cells. Isomerized materials usually show large differences in their electronic structure, absorption spectra, charge transport, and molecular stacking, which are mainly due to different steric hindrance or intramolecular interactions. Recently, an isomerization strategy has been widely used in the central core group of A–D–A- or A–DAD–A-type non-fullerene acceptors. Hence, it is also important to investigate the isomerization effect of the end groups.
Herein, we introduced a phenoxy group to the terminal IC unit and synthesized two fused-ring acceptors, Y-G41 and Y-G42, which are two separable isomers. The phenoxy group decreases the planarity of the terminal unit, enhancing the solubility of the acceptors and elevating the energy levels of the acceptors. The isomeric effect of these two acceptors on the blend-film morphology and the device performance was investigated. We also synthesized the corresponding acceptor molecule (Y-F) with two monofluoro-substituted IC terminal units for the control experiment. PBDB-T, which has matchable energy levels with these acceptors,48–50 was selected as the donor polymer to fabricate the OSCs. As expected, the OSCs based on Y-G41 and Y-G42 give higher open circuit voltage (Voc) values than those based on Y-F, due to the introduction of the electron-donating phenoxy group in the terminal IC unit. Interestingly, it was found that the substituent position of the phenoxy group in the terminal IC unit influences not only the solubility and film absorption spectrum, but also the morphology of the blend films. PBDB-T:Y-G42-based OSCs show more appropriate nanoscale phase separation, higher and more balanced charge-carrier mobilities, and higher fill factor (FF) values in comparison with PBDB-T:Y-G41-based OSCs. As a result, the Y-G42-based OSCs exhibit a PCE of 15.24%, which is much higher than those of OSCs based on Y-G41 (12.12%) and Y-F (12.53%). All in all, we have demonstrated that the appropriate modification of the terminal IC unit with a protruding phenoxy group can markedly enhance the photovoltaic performance of OSCs.
Results and discussion
Material synthesis and characterization
As shown in Scheme 1, taking 4,5-difluoro-1,2-benzenedicarbonitrile (1) as the starting material, compound 2 was synthesized in a yield of 81% by reacting 1 with phenol using potassium carbonate as the base and N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) as the solvent. Hydrolysis of compound 2 afforded compound 3 in a yield of 86%, which was converted into compound 4via treatment with acetic anhydride at 120 °C. Claisen condensation of compound 4 with tert-butyl acetoacetate and decarboxylation with dilute acid afforded the 1,3-indandione compound 5 in 70% yield. Compounds G41 and G42, which were synthesized by the reaction of compound 5 with malononitrile, are two isomers and can be separated using a column chromatography due to their polarity difference. Finally, acceptors Y-G41 and Y-G42 were obtained in yields of 65% and 73% via the Knoevenagel condensation of compounds G41 and G42 with dialdehyde 7, respectively. Y-F was prepared using a similar procedure. All these acceptors are readily dissolved in various common solvents such as chloroform, chlorobenzene and o-dichlorobenzene at room temperature, meeting the prerequisite for solution processing. The solubilities of Y-G42 and Y-G41 in chloroform were determined to be 82 and 64 mg mL−1, respectively, which are higher than Y-F (48 mg mL−1).51,52

DFT calculations
Density functional theory (DFT) calculations at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level were carried out to investigate the chemical geometries of Y-F, Y-G41 and Y-G42, where all alkyl chains are replaced by methyl groups for simplification. The optimized geometries of Y-F, Y-G41 and Y-G42 are shown in Fig. 1. The backbone of Y-F adopts a nearly planar configuration. As for Y-G41 and Y-G42, the molecular backbones are also planar, but the two terminal phenoxy groups are almost perpendicular to the molecular backbone. The dihedral angles between the phenoxy group and the IC unit in Y-G41 and Y-G42 are 90.23° and 96.16°, respectively. In comparison with Y-F, Y-G41 and Y-G42 should possess enhanced solubilities and decreased π–π interactions between the terminal IC units due to the two protruding phenoxy terminal groups.

Optical properties
The normalized absorption spectra of Y-F, Y-G41 and Y-G42 in dilute chloroform solutions and as thin films are displayed in Fig. 2a and b, and the corresponding data are listed in Table 1. Interestingly, these three acceptors display quite similar solution absorption profiles in the range of 400–900 nm with the maximum absorption (λmax) located at 730 nm for Y-F and 724 nm for Y-G41 and Y-G42. The absorption spectra of Y-G41 and Y-G42 are almost overlapped. Compared with Y-F, the main absorption peaks of Y-G41 and Y-G42 exhibited a hypsochromic shift of around 5–6 nm owing to the introduction of two weak electron-donating phenoxy groups. In going from solutions to films, all the absorption spectra became broader and markedly red-shifted. Y-F and Y-G41 showed larger red-shifts in their absorption (approximately 85 nm) than Y-G42 (ca. 68 nm), indicating that these two acceptors probably possess strong intermolecular interactions in the solid state. The different red-shifts of isomer Y-G41 and Y-G42 films indicate that a slight structural change could cause a significant difference for the two isomers in the intermolecular interaction and packing in the film. The absorption coefficients were determined to be 2.10 × 105, 2.16 × 105, and 2.12 × 105 M−1 cm−1 for Y-F, Y-G41 and Y-G42, respectively. The optical bandgap (Eoptg) values of Y-F, Y-G41, and Y-G42 were calculated to be 1.37, 1.42, and 1.43 eV, respectively, from the corresponding film absorption onsets 902, 876 and 866 nm.

Electrochemical properties
The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of these three acceptors were determined via electrochemical cyclic voltammetry (CV) according to the equation: EHOMO/LUMO = −e[Eox/red,onset − E(Fc/Fc+) + 4.8], where Eox/red,onset represents the onset of the first oxidation/reduction peak of the NFAs and E(Fc/Fc+) is the redox potential of the ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) couple in the electrochemical measurement system. The LUMO/HOMO energy levels of Y-F, Y-G41 and Y-G42 were therefore calculated to be −3.82/−5.73, −3.82/−5.61 and −3.84/−5.62 eV, respectively. The energy levels and Ecvg values are summarized in Table 1, and the energy-level diagram is presented in Fig. 2d. Compared with Y-F, the two isomers Y-G41 and Y-G42 display higher HOMO and LUMO levels due to the introduction of an electron-donating phenoxy group in the terminal unit.42 Due to its suitable absorption and energy levels, PBDB-T was selected as the polymer donor to pair with these acceptors to fabricate OSCs.
Photovoltaic properties
Inverted OSCs with the device structure of ITO/ZnO/active layer/MoO3/Ag were fabricated to study the photovoltaic properties of the NFAs.53 To optimize the photovoltaic performance, the polymer-to-acceptor weight ratio, the additives and the annealing conditions were systematically screened. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves are shown in Fig. 3a. The detailed optimization process is provided in the ESI† and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Tables S1–S3 (ESI†). The PBDB-T:Y-F-based OSC gave a PCE of 12.53% with a Voc of 0.84 V, a short circuit current density (Jsc) of 21.45 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 71.02%; the PBDB-T:Y-G41-based OSC showed a PCE of 12.12% with a Voc of 0.87 V, a Jsc of 19.96 mA cm−2 and an FF of 70.14%; and the PBDB-T:Y-G42-based OSC performed much better with a PCE of 15.24%, a Voc of 0.91 V, a Jsc of 23.31 mA cm−2 and an FF of 72.14% (Table 2). The higher Voc values of the OSCs based on PBDB-T:Y-G41 and PBDB-T:Y-G42 over that of the PBDB-T:Y-F-based OSC is mainly due to their high LUMO levels. The high photovoltaic performance of the Y-G42-based OSC can be ascribed to its high and balanced electron/hole mobilities and more favorable nanomorphology of the blend films (vide infra). These results indicate that the introduction of a phenoxy group and a fluoro group in the terminal unit can simultaneously increase the Jsc, Voc and FF of OSCs, thus leading to a markedly increased PCE. Meanwhile, the position of phenoxy group in the terminal unit has a great influence on the device performance.

To verify the reliability of the J–V tests, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves of the OSCs were recorded. As shown in Fig. 3b, all the devices exhibit broad photovoltaic responses spanning from 300 to 950 nm, which are consistent with the UV-vis absorption spectra of the corresponding blend films. The calculated Jsc values from the EQE curves (Jsc,cal) match well with the measured Jsc values with errors of less than 5%. Despite sharing a similar photovoltaic response range, it can be observed that the PBDB-T:Y-G42-based devices possess more effective photon-harvesting and charge-collection capabilities than the devices based on PBDB-T:Y-F and PBDB-T:Y-G41, which is consistent with their higher Jsc.
Charge mobilities
The hole (μh) and electron (μe) transport properties of the OSCs were investigated using the space charge limited current (SCLC) method (Fig. S2a and b, ESI†), and the results are summarized in Table S4 (ESI†). The electron (μe)/hole mobilities (μh) and μe/μh values of the optimized devices based on PBDB-T:Y-F, PBDB-T:Y-G41 and PBDB-T:Y-G42 are 2.91 × 10−5/1.75 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 S−1 and 1.66, 3.58 × 10−5/1.76 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 S−1 and 2.03, and 3.77 × 10−5/3.06 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 S−1 and 1.23, respectively. The results indicate that the PBDB-T:Y-G42 blend films exhibited slightly higher and more balanced hole and electron mobilities, which are favorable for charge transport and collection and can well explain their higher Jsc and FF.
Recombination dynamics
To understand the reason for the different photovoltaic performances of the devices based on the three acceptors, we analyzed their carrier-transport and -recombination properties. The photocurrent density (Jph) versus effective voltage (Veff) curves, as shown in Fig. 3c, were used to evaluate the charge-dissociation probabilities (Pdiss) of the devices.54Jph is defined as the photocurrent density difference between illuminated (JL) and dark (JD) conditions. Veff = V0 – V, where V0 is the voltage at which the photocurrent reaches zero and V is the applied voltage. When Jph reaches saturation (Jsat), it suggests that the exciton dissociation reaches the maximum level and the charges are almost collected by the electrode. The charge-dissociation probabilities (Pdiss), calculated from Jph/Jsat, are 93.6%, 92.4%, and 91.8% for the devices based on PBDB-T:Y-F, PBDB-T:Y-G41, and PBDB-T:Y-G42, respectively, indicating that all of them have efficient and similar exciton-dissociation and charge-collection efficiencies. To further understand the bimolecular and trap-assisted recombination behavior of these NFAs, we measured the dependence of Jsc and Voc on the light intensity (Plight) in the devices. As shown in Fig. S2c (ESI†), the bimolecular recombination degree can be reflected by the exponent α in the relationship Jsc ∝ Pαlight. The α values of the PBDB-T:Y-F, PBDB-T:Y-G41 and PBDB-T:Y-G42 blend films are 0.96, 0.91 and 0.95, respectively, demonstrating that the PBDB-T:Y-F and PBDB-T:Y-G42 blend films can better impede bimolecular recombination than the PBDB-T:Y-G41 blend film, which explains the superior Jsc and FF of their devices. The trap-assisted recombination can be described by the relationship between Voc and Plightvia the formula Voc ∝ nkT/qln(Plight). As depicted in Fig. S2d (ESI†), the n values of PBDB-T:Y-F, PBDB-T:Y-G41 and PBDB-T:Y-G42 blend films are 2.13, 1.83 and 1.39 kT/q, respectively, indicating that the trap-assisted recombination is also effectively suppressed in the PBDB-T:Y-G42-based device.
Non-radiative recombination losses
The non-radiative recombination losses in OSCs often constitute a significant part of the total energy losses, and are usually higher than those in inorganic or perovskite solar cells.55,56 The non-radiative energy losses are related to the external quantum efficiency of electroluminescence (EQEEL) via the equation qΔVnon-rad = −kTln(EQEEL), where q is the elementary charge, k is the Boltzmann constant and T is the temperature.57 To further study the non-radiative recombination losses for the devices based on the three molecules, the EQEEL values are measured and the non-radiative recombination losses are 0.238 eV, 0.231 eV and 0.218 eV for the devices based on PBDB-T:Y-F, PBDB-T:Y-G41 and PBDB-T:Y-G42, respectively, indicating similar and low non-radiative recombination losses, which approach those of amorphous Si or perovskite solar cells.55,56,58
Morphology characterization
The nanoscale morphology of blend films was investigated using atomic force microscopy (AFM). As shown in Fig. 4a–c, significantly different surface morphologies can be observed for the three blend films. The PBDB-T:Y-F blend film showed a high root mean square (RMS) value of 2.66 nm, revealing its rather rough surface morphology. The PBDB-T:Y-G41, and PBDB-T:Y-G42 blend films exhibited decreased RMS values of 1.92 and 1.66 nm, respectively, due to incorporation of the protruding phenoxy substituents. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) is used to observe further the in-depth morphologies of blend films. As shown in Fig. 4d–f, the PBDB-T:Y-F and PBDB-T:Y-G41 blend films show thick fibrillar-like aggregates, whereas the PBDB-T:Y-G42 blend film exhibits a rather homogeneous morphology without any obvious large-size phase separation, which is beneficial for achieving higher and more balanced carrier mobilities in the blend film, and can well explain the high Jsc and FF values obtained.59,60 From the above investigations, we can clearly see that the position of the phenoxy group in the IC unit has a significant influence on the active-layer morphology.

To further investigate the molecular orientation and stacking behavior in the blend film, grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) investigations were carried out. The corresponding 2D patterns are shown in Fig. 5 and the analysis results of lamellar and π–π stacking peaks are listed in Table S5 (ESI†). The pure Y-F, Y-G41 and Y-G42 films show face-on dominant orientations with obvious (010) diffraction peaks at qz ≈ 1.66, 1.67 and 1.63 Å−1 in the out-of-plane (OOP) direction, corresponding to π–π stacking distances (dπ–π) of 3.79, 3.75 and 3.85 Å, respectively. The film of Y-F possessed a large coherence length (CL) of 14.30 nm. As the link position changes and the degree of molecular twist increases for Y-G41 and Y-G42, the crystallite sizes of Y-G41 and Y-G42 are reduced to 14.12 and 12.26 nm. When blending with PBDB-T, the blend films also show enhanced face-on orientations with similar dπ–π values, which are favourable for charge transport. The crystallite sizes of the blend systems for PBDB-T:Y-G42 increase slightly in contrast to that of PBDB-T (CL = 17.26 nm for PBDB-T and 18.28 nm for PBDB-T:Y-G42). The improved crystallinity and molecular order of the donor polymer and the acceptors lead to increased device efficiency.

Conclusion
We synthesized two isomeric A–D–A-type NFAs, Y-G41 and Y-G42, with a Y-series core. The introduction of an electron-donating phenoxy group in the terminal IC unit can enhance the solubility of the acceptors and increase the Voc of the devices. The PBDB-T:Y-G41-based OSC exhibits a PCE of 12.12%, which is comparable to the device based on PBDB-T:Y-F (12.53%). The PBDB-T:Y-G42-based device shows a much improved device performance with a PCE of 15.24%. The above results demonstrate that isomerization at the terminal IC unit has a significant influence on the solubility, blend-film morphology and device performance. The modification of the terminal group is an effective way to achieve high-performance acceptor materials.
