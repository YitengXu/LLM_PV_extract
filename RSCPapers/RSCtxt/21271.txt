    , Accepted 25th August 2018First published on 28th August 2018AbstractThe hole transport layer (HTL) and electron transport layer (ETL) play critical roles in perovskite solar cells (PVSCs). However, few studies have been done to optimize these two charge transport layers for two-dimensional (2D) PVSCs. Here in this work, both the HTL and ETL of PVSCs based on 2D perovskite (CH3(CH2)2NH3)2(CH3NH3)2Pb3I10 (BA2MA2Pb3I10) are optimized to achieve high open-circuit voltage (Voc) and power conversion efficiency (PCE). The solution-processed NiOx was employed as the HTL to fabricate efficient 2D PVSCs with the structure of indium tin oxide (ITO)/HTL/BA2MA2Pb3I10/ETL/bathocuproine (BCP)/Ag. The PCE of the device with [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) as the ETL is increased from 7.99% to 11.01% when NiOx was applied as the HTL instead of the commonly used poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS). The improved performance was attributed to the better matched energy levels and the reduced trap state for NiOx based devices. Considering the deeper HOMO (the highest occupied molecular orbital) level of ICBA (indene-C60 bisadduct), ICBA was mixed with PCBM as the ETL to reduce the interfacial charge recombination between the perovskite and ETL. This strategy further boosted the PCE to 12.07% with the highest Voc of 1.23 V for 2D PVSCs so far. This work suggests the potential of interfacial engineering for the performance improvement of 2D PVSCs.
1. Introduction
Recently, two-dimensional (2D) layered perovskites have emerged as a new exciting class of materials that exhibit enhanced stability versus their 3D counterparts, such as CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3), HC(NH2)2PbI3 (FAPbI3), etc.1–5 The 2D perovskites with the chemical formula of A2Bn−1MnX3n+1 (n ≥ 2), where M represents Pb2+ or Sn2+, B is CH3NH3+ (MA+), HC(NH2)2+ (FA+), or Cs+, A is the spacer cation including CH3(CH2)3NH3+ (BA+) and C6H5(CH2)2NH3+ (PEA+), have been developed and applied as the light-harvesting layer in perovskite solar cells (PVSCs). However, the spacer cation would form an insulating layer and block the charge transport inside the perovskite layer, causing the decrease of the photo-induced current.2,3 As a result, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 2D PVSCs is far behind that of their 3D counterparts,5 which has been already above 22%.6
To improve the efficiency of 2D PVSCs, most of the studies have been focused on morphology or material engineering,1–3,7–9 especially on the orientation regulation of 2D perovskite films. A. D. Mohite et al.1 achieved the vertical orientation of the BA2MA2Pb3I10 film by a hot casting method and obtained a high efficiency of 12.56%. H. Chen et al. added NH4SCN to both BA2MA3Pb4I13 and PEA2MA4Pb5I16 as the additive to induce the vertical orientation of the 2D perovskite crystals, and boosted the efficiency to 8.79% (ref. 2) and 11.01%,3 respectively. H. Zhou et al.8 partially replaced the MAI with FAI and improved the efficiency to 12.81% with a mixed 2D perovskite of BA2(MA0.8FA0.2)3Pb4I13. S. Liu et al.4 added 5% Cs+ to the BA2MA3Pb4I13 and improved the efficiency to 13.7%. C. Lee et al.9 used propane-1,3-diammonium (PDA) as the space cation ammonium to shorten the interlayer distance and improve the charge transportation, and achieved a PCE of 13.0%. These improvements can be mostly attributed to the elevated charge transport ability of the 2D perovskite films. However, the open-circuit voltage (Voc) of the mentioned devices is around 1.0 V to 1.1 V (see Table S1†), even lower than those of some of the MAPbI3 systems.10–12 Since the bandgap of the low n 2D perovskite is usually wider than that of the 3D perovskite,2,3e.g. MAPbI3, which would lead to insufficient light absorption and lower current density, a high Voc is indispensable for the efficiency improvement of 2D PVSCs. By optimizing the morphology of the 2D perovskite film, the Voc of the PVSCs based on the 2D perovskite with PEA as the space cation was elevated over 1.10 V.13,14 Z. Liang et al.15 fabricated iso-BAI based 2D perovskite films and achieved a high Voc of 1.20 V in reverse scanning, however, the Voc decreased to 0.92 V in forward scanning.
The interface layer would determine the charge extraction16–22 and influence the surface trap density.20,23,24 It is regarded as one of the key factors affecting the performance of PVSCs, especially the Voc.10,16,17,25–28 However for 2D PVSCs, few studies have been carried out to study the interface effect on the performance. Besides, among the high efficiency 2D PVSCs reported so far (PCE >10%), most of the inverted 2D PVSCs are fabricated by using poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) as the hole transport layer (HTL) and [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) as the electron transport layer (see Table S1†). It is known that PEDOT:PSS is not the ideal HTL for PVSCs in terms of both the efficiency17,29–32 and the stability,29,31 owing to its acidity, tendency to absorb water, and serious charge recombination.32 NiOx has been widely used as the HTL for 3D PVSCs32–34 and has been proved to be a better HTL than PEDOT:PSS,29,30,32 mainly due to its neutral, well aligned energy level with the perovskite, and good water resistance, etc. Except for the Sn2+ based 2D PVSC reported by Z. Ning et al.,35 few successful attempts have been reported for 2D PVSCs with NiOx as the HTL. M. G. Kanatzidis et al.36 used a mixed solvent (DMF:DMSO) to fabricate 2D PVSCs on both PEDOT:PSS and NiOx. However, the PCE of the NiOx based device is only 5.6%, much lower than that (10.0%) of the PEDOT:PSS based device.
Due to its advantages of the trap-passivation effect37,38 and a suitable energy level,10 PCBM has been widely used in 2D PVSCs, especially for the inverted structure (see Table S1†). Many modifications on PCBM and other fullerene derivative electron transport layers (ETLs) were conducted to improve the performance of devices based on 3D perovskites. For example, PCBM was doped with a small amount of polystyrene25 or poly(methyl methacrylate)39 to form a smoother blend layer, which could reduce the interface recombination and boosted the efficiency. A bilayer ETL structure was used40 to ensure full coverage and reduce the charge recombination. J. Huang et al.10 used a solvent annealing method to improve the crystallinity of PCBM and resulted in an enhancement of Voc from 1.04 V to 1.13 V. Methylamine hydroiodide,41 4-(1,3-dimethyl-2,3-dihydro-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl)-N,N-diphenylaniline,42 decamethylcobaltocene43and graphdiyne44 were doped into fullerenes ETLs to increase their mobility and modify their energy levels. However, few studies have been done in 2D PVSCs via ETL modification, leaving us space to improve the performance of 2D PVSCs via cathode interface engineering.
Here in this work, we report a new strategy to achieve high PCE and high Voc for 2D PVSCs based on BA2MA2Pb3I10 in terms of energy level alignment and charge recombination. The positive effect of the NiOx HTL on decreasing the energy loss at the interface between the perovskite layer and HTL was revealed. The NiOx based inverted devices exhibited higher Voc and PCE than the PEDOT:PSS based ones. Considering the deeper highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level of indene-C60 bisadduct (ICBA), ICBA was added to the PCBM to form a mixed ETL layer, which could efficiently block the holes and reduce the charge recombination. As a result, the optimized 2D PVSCs with the structure of indium tin oxide (ITO)/NiOx/BA2MA2Pb3I10/PCBM (50 wt% ICBA)/BCP/Ag exhibit a high PCE of 12.07% with the highest Voc of 1.23 V for 2D PVSCs so far. This work suggests the potential of interfacial engineering for the performance improvement of 2D PVSCs.
2. Results and discussion
2.1 Optimization on hole transport layer
Planar heterojunction PVSCs of ITO/HTL/BA2MAI2Pb3I10/PCBM/BCP/Ag with different HTLs (PEDOT:PSS and NiOx) were fabricated, where PCBM served as ETL and BCP as the cathode buffer layer. The BA2MA2Pb3I10 layer was fabricated by a one-step hot-casting method. The J–V curves of the PVSCs with different HTLs are shown in Fig. 1a. The detailed photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 1. From Table 1, we find that, the device with NiOx as the HTL shows the high PCE of 11.01% (in reverse scanning), along with the Voc of 1.21 V, fill factor (FF) of 70.24%, and current density (Jsc) of 12.95 mA cm−2. The efficiency of forward scanning is 10.54%, which is only 4.27% smaller than the reverse one, indicating negligible hysteresis. When NiOx was replaced with PEDOT:PSS, the device shows a much lower efficiency of 7.84%, with a lower Voc of 1.05 V, FF of 67.76% and Jsc of 11.23 mA cm−2. The device with PEDOT:PSS exhibits more obvious hysteresis than that with NiOx. The integrated current density (Jcal) extracted from EQE (Fig. 1b) for the PVSC with NiOx or PEDOT:PSS as the HTL is 12.10 mA cm−2 or 10.35 mA cm−2, which are well consistent with Jsc values from J–V curves. Fig. 1c presents the results of the photocurrent density where PCE is a function of time at the maximum power point. The photocurrent remains stable during a 300 s photocurrent measurement, and a stable PCE output of 10.4% and 7.5% is obtained for the NiOx-based and PEDOT:PSS-based devices, respectively. From Fig. 1d, the corresponding average PCEs of 40 individual devices with NiOx and PEDOT:PSS HTLs are 10.37 ± 0.29% and 7.58 ± 0.55%, respectively, in good agreement with those from the mentioned PCE outputs. All these results suggest that the device photovoltaic parameters are reliable. The device storage stability was also tested in a glovebox for PEDOT:PSS/PCBM and NiOx/PCBM devices (shown in Fig. S1a†). We find that both devices exhibited good storage stability and maintained 90% of their initial efficiencies after 45 days in a glovebox. The good stability could originate from the stable 2D perovskite films. Fig. S1b and c† show the XRD patterns of PEDOT:PSS/BA2MAI2Pb3I10 and NiOx/BA2MAI2Pb3I10 films conducted in ambient air with the relative humidity (RH) of 60%. The peak for PbI2 (12.7°) cannot be detected for both films, indicating good humidity stability for both films.

To understand the influence of the HTL (PEDOT:PSS and NiOx) on the device performance better, systematic studies were carried out from the viewpoint of the energy level alignment of the device. The UPS and UV-vis absorption were measured to determine the energy levels for HTLs, ETLs and BA2MA2Pb3I10, as shown in Fig. 2a and S2.† From Fig. 2a, it is found that the BA2MA2Pb3I10 films on PEDOT:PSS and NiOx have different HOMO levels of −5.57 eV (PEDOT:PSS) and −5.70 eV (NiOx). From Fig. S2a,† we find that the optical bandgap of the BA2MA2Pb3I10 film was independent of the substrates of PEDOT:PSS and NiOx, and was calculated to be 1.96 eV, which is well consistent with that from other reports.2 The corresponding lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level was calculated to be −3.61 eV and −3.74 eV for the BA2MA2Pb3I10 film on PEDOT:PSS and NiOx, respectively. XPS measurements were carried out to reveal the constituent induced energy level shift of the perovskite films. As shown in Fig. 2b and c, the fitting peaks at 284.9 eV and 286.0 eV correspond to the alkyl chains in BA, while the peak at 286.5 eV is for C–N bonds. The compositions concentration of these three different C atoms (284.9 eV, 286.0 eV and 286.5 eV) are 57.81%: 23.95%: 18.24% for the perovskite film on NiOx and 48.13%: 45.91%: 5.96% for the perovskite film on PEDOT:PSS. Therefore, the lower content of C–N bonds in the perovskite film on the PEDOT:PSS surface indicated a higher content of BA+, i.e. higher content of perovskite phases with low n values, which is responsible for the upshift of the HOMO level.45,46 Similarly, we estimated the energy levels of PCBM to be −3.82 eV (LUMO) and −5.73 eV (HOMO) (see Fig. S2b and c†). In addition, the measured work functions (WF) of PEDOT:PSS (−5.20 eV) and NiOx (−5.37 eV) (see Fig. S2d†) are also well consistent with those from the report.47 The energy level diagrams of the devices are shown in Fig. 2d and e. We observe that the energy level alignments are better in the NiOx-based device than in the PEDOT:PSS-based device. The better matched energy levels in both HTL and ETL interfaces for the NiOx/PCBM device would result in less nonradiative recombination, leading to less energy loss and higher voltage output.32,48–50

The morphology dependence of the BA2MA2Pb3I10 film on the substrate can be illustrated by the SEM images in Fig. 3 and S3.† The perovskite film exhibits a smooth and pin-hole free surface on NiOx but shows a lot of cracks on PEDOT:PSS, though they both present a vertically oriented morphology with brick-like grains and a similar thickness around 270 nm (Fig. S3†). The grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) patterns are shown in Fig. S4,† in which both perovskite films also show similar orientational order and crystallinity.1

We also measured the steady PL to study the effect of different HTLs on the structure of perovskites. Fig. 4a shows the normalized PL spectra of the BA2MA2Pb3I10 films on PEDOT:PSS and NiOx measured from back (HTL) and front (perovskite) sides. It is found that the emission peaks at 616 nm and 650 nm can be only detected for the BA2MA2Pb3I10 film on PEDOT:PSS excited from the back side. These two peaks are ascribed to the 2D BA2MAn−1PbnI3n+1 film with lower n values, i.e. 3 and 4, respectively.46 Generally, the 2D perovskite tends to form multiple phases with different n values.13,46 Compared to the BA2MA2Pb3I10 film on NiOx, more low-n phases tend to be formed at the back side (PEDOT:PSS side) in the BA2MA2Pb3I10 film on PEDOT:PSS, which is in good agreement with the results from XPS data (Fig. 2b and c). Considering the wider bandgap and the larger exciton binding energy of the low-n phase,45 the increase of the low-n phase will be harmful to light harvesting and exciton separation as well. In other words, the perovskite film on NiOx has a broader light absorption and a higher exciton separation efficiency. Besides, the emission peak of the BA2MA2Pb3I10 film on PEDOT:PSS presents a slight red shift from 738 nm (back side) to 740 nm (front side), indicating more trap states on the perovskite/air surface.23 On the other hand, a blue-shift of the front side emission from 740 nm to 735 nm is observed for the BA2MA2Pb3I10 film on NiOx, indicating less surface defects for the perovskite film grown on NiOx.23 The argument of less surface defects or trap states in the BA2MA2Pb3I10 film on NiOx than on PEDOT:PSS is also supported by the crack-free surface26,51 of the perovskite film on NiOx (see Fig. 3). Fig. 4b shows the normalized TRPL spectra of the BA2MA2Pb3I10 films, and the measured lifetimes are summarized in Table 2. The average lifetime (τave) for the perovskite film on PEDOT:PSS varies a lot when excited from different sides, i.e. 17.081 ns from the front side and 29.480 ns from the back side, indicating more traps in the perovskite/air surface,50,52 as supported by the SEM images in Fig. 3c and d. However the perovskite film on NiOx exhibits close and shorter lifetimes of 13.277 ns and 12.855 ns excited from the front side to the back side, indicating slightly less trap states on the perovskite/air surface than on the perovskite/NiOx surface.50,52 Since the lifetime is decided by the defect density and the charge extraction ability of the interface layer,50,53 the increase of defects and charge extraction ability would result in the decrease of the lifetime. Though the defect density of the perovskite film on PEDOT:PSS is higher than that on NiOx, the average lifetime of the perovskite film on PEDOT:PSS is still longer than that on NiOx, indicating worse charge extraction of PEDOT:PSS.16,18,30 All these results suggested that the improved photovoltaic performances for NiOx based PVSCs originate from the reduced defect density and better charge extraction.32,38,54

2.2 Optimization of the electron transport layer
2D PVSCs of ITO/NiOx/BA2MA2Pb3I10/ETL/BCP/Ag with different ETLs (PCBM, ICBA and their mixture) were fabricated. The comparison of their J–V curves and performance are shown in Fig. 5a and Table 3. The PVSC based on NiOx/ICBA presents a PCE of 10.54%, with a Voc of 1.24 V, an FF of 63.08%, and a Jsc of 13.49 mA cm−2. The average PCE is 9.98 ± 0.38%, indicating good repeatability. The Jcal is 12.56 mA cm−2, which falls in the accepted errors compared with the Jsc. In addition, the hysteresis of the NiOx/ICBA device is more serious than that of the NiOx/PCBM device, and the main weakness of the NiOx/ICBA device lies in the low FF (63.08%), which is much lower than that of the NiOx/PCBM device (70.24%). However, the Voc and Jsc of the NiOx/ICBA device are higher than those of the NiOx/PCBM device. For the PCBM–ICBA mixed ETL based PVSCs, the PCE increases at the beginning then decreases with the increase of the ICBA weight fraction in the mixed ETLs. The champion device is obtained when the ratio of ICBA is 50 wt%, presenting a PCE of 12.07%, with a Voc of 1.23 V, an FF of 72.17%, and a Jsc of 13.61 mA cm−2. The average PCE of NiOx/PCBM (50 wt% ICBA) is 11.48 ± 0.35%, indicating good repeatability. The Jcal of NiOx/PCBM (50 wt% ICBA) is 12.74 mA cm−2, which matched well with the Jsc. Detailed reverse-forward J–V curves, EQE spectra, stable output and efficiency distribution of NiOx/PCBM, NiOx/PCBM (50 wt% ICBA) and NiOx/ICBA are shown in Fig. 1. We also tested the stability of the unencapsulated champion device in both a glovebox and ambient air. As seen in Fig. S5,† the device maintained ∼60% its initial efficiency after 15 days in ambient air with a humidity of ∼40% and a temperature of 25–30 °C, while it remained almost unchanged when stored in the glovebox, indicating good stability.

Steady PL and TRPL measurements were performed to reveal the mechanism for the improvements. As shown in Fig. 5b, the PL quenching increased when the PCBM weight fraction increased in the mixed ETL. The quenching efficiency for different mixed ETLs are 91.5%, 97.7%, 98.4%, 98.6% and 98.7%, respectively. For the mixed ETLs with a low content of ICBA (≤50%), the quenching efficiency is above 98%, leading to maintaining or even a slightly improvement for the FF, shown in Table 3. However for the high ICBA fraction ETLs, the PL quenching is lower, leading to a decrease on the charge extraction and FF.17,50 A similar tendency is also observed in TRPL, as seen in Fig. 5c and Table S2.† The lifetimes increase from 1.560 ns to 4.197 ns when the ETLs are changed from PCBM to ICBA, which further confirms the lower charge extraction for ICBA.50
Similarly, we also measured the UPS and absorption spectra for ICBA films to establish the energy level, shown in Fig. S2b and c.† The HOMO and LUMO of ICBA are −3.84 eV and −5.82 eV, respectively. We notice that in the NiOx based device (Fig. 2e), the LUMO of ICBA (−5.82 eV) is lower than that of PCBM (−5.73 eV), indicating that ICBA can efficiently block the transport of the photoinduced holes from BA2MA2Pb3I10 (−5.70 eV) to ICBA.55 Therefore, the charge recombination and energy loss would be less at the perovskite/ICBA interface,23,55 leading to higher Jsc and Voc than those in the NiOx/PCBM device. Space charge limited current (SCLC) measurements were conducted to determine the mobility of PCBM and ICBA, as seen in Fig. S6.† The electron mobility of PCBM is 7.29 ± 3.85 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is higher than that of ICBA (1.07 ± 0.63 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1). This is the main reason for the better charge extraction of PCBM,16,17 which is well consistent with the PL results shown in Fig. 5b and c. The lower charge extraction of ICBA may result in charge accumulation56 and is responsible for the hysteresis57,58 and low FF56,57,59 for the NiOx/ICBA device, as seen in Fig. 1a. On the other hand, a higher content of ICBA would be beneficial for the blocking of the holes, as discussed above, therefore leading to an increase of the Voc. As a result, a balance was achieved in 50 wt% ICBA mixed ETLs, and the champion efficiency of 12.07% was obtained with a high Voc of 1.23 V.
3. Conclusions
In summary, we have demonstrated a dramatic enhancement of Voc and PCE in inverted 2D BA2MAI2Pb3I10 PVSCs through interfacial engineering. The perovskite BA2MAI2Pb3I10 films grown on a NiOx HTL showed a much smoother and crack-free surface than those on the PEDOT:PSS HTL, resulting in reduced defect density. The much better energy level alignment between BA2MAI2Pb3I10 and the HTL/ETL caused by the surface constituent variation on the NiOx substrate led to a reduced energy loss at both the anode and cathode interfaces. As a result, a high efficiency of 11.01% with a Voc exceeding 1.20 V was achieved in PVSCs with NiOx as the HTL. By mixing ICBA with a deeper HOMO level with PCBM as the ETL, the interfacial charge recombination was further reduced, and thus boosted the efficiency to 12.07% and increased the Voc to 1.23 V, which is the highest value for 2D PVSCs so far. The results suggest the potential of interfacial engineering for the performance improvement of 2D PVSCs.

N,N-Dimethylacetamide (DMAc), ethylene glycol, butylamine hydroiodide (BAI) and bathocuproine (BCP) were purchased from TCI. N-Methyl pyrrolidine (NMP), chloroform (CF) and dichlorobenzene (DCB) were bought from Sigma Aldrich. Nickel(II) nitrate hexahydrate, ethylenediamine, isopropanol and PbI2 were bought from Alfa Aesar. Methylammonium iodide (MAI) was purchased from Shanghai Mater Win New Materials. PCBM was bought from American Dye Source. ICBA was bought from Luminescence Technology. PEDOT:PSS (Al 4083) aqueous solution was purchased from Baytron. All materials were used directly if not specified.
4.2 Device fabrication and characterization
The ITO coated glass substrates were cleaned sequentially in detergent (Hellmanex, 2 vol%), deionized water, acetone, and isopropanol in an ultrasonic bath for 15 min, respectively. After that, the substrates were dried in nitrogen flow and cleaned by UV-ozone treatment for 20 min before use. The NiOx film was prepared according to a literature report.29,34 In a word, the NiOx film was spin-coated from the precursor solution containing nickel(II) nitrate hexahydrate:ethylenediamine = 1 M:1 M in ethylene glycol onto ITO glass and then annealed at 150 °C for 0.5 h and 300 °C for 1 h. The PEDOT:PSS HTL was prepared by spin coating PEDOT:PSS aqueous solution at 4000 rpm for 40 s, followed by annealing at 140 °C for 20 min. BAI, MAI and PbI2 were mixed at a 2:2:3 molar ratio (n = 3) in a DMAc and NMP (4:1 by volume) mixed solvent with the concentration of 0.4 M (based on Pb). The perovskite precursor solution and NiOx (PEDOT:PSS) substrates were heated to 70 °C before spin coating the perovskite layer. The spin-coating process started initially at 1000 rpm for 10 s and then 6000 rpm for 60 s after dropping the heated precursor to the heated NiOx (PEDOT:PSS) substrate, followed by annealing at 100 °C for 8 min. PCBM or ICBA or a PCBM:ICBA solution mixture(5 mg ml−1 in CF) was spin-coated on the perovskite at 2000 rpm for 30 s. BCP (0.5 mg ml−1 in isopropanol) was then spin-coated on PCBM (or ICBA or the PCBM:ICBA mixture) at 4000 rpm for 30 s, followed by deposition of 100 nm Ag in a vacuum chamber under a high vacuum of 5 × 10−4 Pa.
The UV-visible absorption spectra were taken on a UV-2450 UV-Vis Shimadzu Spectrophotometer. The time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra and steady-state PL were taken on a FLSP920 Spectrofluorometer from Edinburgh Instruments, TRPL was conducted with a laser of 405 nm and steady-state PL was excited using a xenon lamp of 470 nm. X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS) and Ultraviolet photoelectron spectrometer (UPS) measurements were conducted on an ESCALAB 250Xi (Thermo) system, the energy of the incident light energy for UPS measurements is 21.22 eV. The field-emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) measurements were carried out on a Hitachi S-4800 machine. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristic curves were recorded on a Keithley source unit under AM1.5G 1 sun intensity illumination by a solar simulation from Enli Technology. The J–V measurement was performed in a glovebox under a N2 atmosphere and the device area is 0.06 cm2, which is defined by the metal mask. The scanning voltage step is 0.02 V, with a delay time of 10 ms per step, the total scan rate is 0.095 V s−1. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectrum was measured using a QE-R Model of Enli Technology. GIWAXS measurements were carried out at a Xeuss 2.0 SAXS/WAXS laboratory beamline using a Cu X-ray source (8.05 keV, 1.54 Å) and a Pilatus3R 300K detector. The incidence angle is 0.3°.
