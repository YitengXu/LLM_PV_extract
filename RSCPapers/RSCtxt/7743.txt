    , Accepted 23rd January 2019First published on 24th January 2019AbstractSuitable vertical component distribution within an organic bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) is vital for effective exciton dissociation and smooth charge transport in perovskite/organic integrated solar cells (ISCs). Herein, a bi-continuous interpenetrating network of organic donor/acceptor materials is constructed simply by optimizing their weight ratio, and is further applied in perovskite/organic ISCs. Time-of-flight secondary-ion mass spectroscopy (TOF-SIMS) and scanning Kelvin probe microscopy (SKPM) strongly confirm that this method can effectively restrict vertical stratification and build a desired bi-continuous framework within the organic photoactive layer, which can effectively suppress two potential recombination losses from the viewpoint of kinetics, leading to the PCE increasing from 12.63% to 15.47% for ISCs based on the structure of MAPbI3/PBDB-T:IEICO. Meanwhile, our ISCs combining a UV–vis harvesting layer of MAPbI3 and a near-infrared absorbing layer of PBDB-T:IEICO exhibit a photo-response extending to the whole visible and infrared spectrum (up to 900 nm). This work verifies that tuning the donor/acceptor weight ratio is a feasible strategy for optimizing the morphology of BHJ absorbers and suppressing charge recombination for efficient perovskite/BHJ ISCs.
Introduction
Perovskite materials are currently considered the most promising light absorbers for efficient photovoltaic devices due to their large absorption coefficient, long exciton diffusion length and high carrier mobility.1–3 The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has surpassed 23%, benefiting from the development of high-quality perovskite films, new device architectures, compositional engineering and the in-depth understanding of charge transport dynamics.4 However, the absorption spectra of perovskite materials is far from ideal since the absorption spectra of perfect materials should cover most of the sunlight spectrum. Commonly used methylammonium lead halide perovskites (MAPbI3 and MAPbI3−xClx), which can only absorb sunlight below 800 nm, underutilize most of the near-infrared (NIR) solar radiation and thus limit the enhancement of the short-circuit current (Jsc).5–7 Consequently, broadening the NIR light response and simultaneously enhancing the utilization of visible sunlight are extensively promoted as one of the solutions to further improve the PCE of PSCs.8–10
Several strategies have been adopted to extend the absorption spectra of PSCs. Snaith and Seok et al. replaced the MA cation with the formamidinium (FA) cation and slightly broadened the absorption spectrum to 850 nm.11,12 Another alternative method is to use a hybrid tin halide base perovskite as a light absorber, which pushes the photo-response to 1060 nm, but the PCE was hindered by poor device stability and a low open circuit voltage.13,14 The tandem structure consisting of two or more sub-cells with complementary absorbing materials seems to be an effective approach to broaden the spectral coverage.15,16 But the Jsc of series tandem cells is limited by the sub-cell with the lower Jsc ascribed to the basic current matching requirement despite the fact that the total open circuit voltage (Voc) is the sum of each sub-cell, and the unbalanced photocurrent output for each sub-cell will reduce the achievable PCE of tandem cells.17–19 Similarly, the open circuit voltage (Voc) of parallel tandem devices is restricted by the sub-cell with the smaller Voc though the total Jsc is the combination of each sub-cell.20–22 Furthermore, the interlayer is indispensable both in series and parallel tandem cells, resulting in a more complicated device fabrication process.23 Integrated solar cells (ISCs), which combine a perovskite and a bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) organic semiconductor, as an NIR absorber, have neither the current- or voltage-match requirements nor the fabrication of the interlayer countered in tandem solar cells, and this is regarded as a simple and promising approach to significantly extend the photo-response in the NIR.24–26
In organic solar cells (OSCs), the vertical component distribution plays a crucial role in charge transport and recombination, further determining device performance.27–29 The previous literature reported that the interpenetrating network of the organic photoactive layer with donors or acceptors accumulated or depleted near the electrode is beneficial for reducing charge recombination and selectively collecting carriers.30–32 Hence, the vertical component distribution can also be called vertical stratification in OSCs. However, in perovskite/organic ISCs, the perovskite and organic photoactive layer both act as a light absorber and a charge transporter due to their bi-polar transport characteristics.33 From the viewpoint of kinetics, the desired vertical component distribution can not only realize complete exciton dissociation generated within the organic photoactive layer and smooth charge transport to the corresponding electrode, but can also selectively transport carriers from the perovskite film and spontaneously inhibit these parts of carriers’ recombination with carriers generated in the BHJ layer.33 Hence, the traditional vertical stratification in OSCs is not suitable for ISCs because it cannot offer a smooth and independent pathway for carrier transportation, resulting in serious carrier recombination. In our opinion, a more uniform bi-continuous interpenetrating network in perovskite/organic ISCs than that of pure OSCs is urgently needed to ensure smooth transportation and collection of both types of carriers. Unfortunately, the formation of a uniform bi-continuous interpenetrating network for the photoactive layer remains challenging and the origins of its formation mechanism are still vague.
In this work, we introduce a feasible method for optimizing the organic donor/acceptor weight ratio to build a uniform bi-continuous interpenetrating network, and apply it in perovskite/organic ISCs based on the structure of MAPbI3/PBDB-T:IEICO. The ISCs with the optimized BHJ absorber exhibit a significantly increased fill factor (FF) attributed to the suppressed recombination and a clearly boosted Jsc (from 21.82 to 23.11 mA cm−2) due to the additional NIR harvesting, whilst maintaining a high Voc (from 1.05 to 1.07 V). The resulting PCE is 15.47% surpassing the reference ISCs with the traditional vertical stratification BHJ structure. Notably, a significant extension of the photo-response up to 900 nm was detected. This work proves that the formation of an optimized bi-continuous interpenetrating network of the BHJ is crucial for efficient ISCs with panchromatic absorption and provides a feasible way for constructing the desired BHJ morphology.
Experimental
Materials
Fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) glass with a sheet resistance of 15 Ω sq−1 was purchased from Wuhan Geao (China). 75% titanium (diisopropoxide) bis(2,4-pentanedionate) (TIPD) isopropanol solution, 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, 99.7+%) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, 99.7+%) were bought from Alfa Aesea. 4-tert-Butylpyridine (TBP) was bought from Sigma Aldrich. PbI2 and CH3NH3I for fabricating perovskite films were purchased from Xi'an Polymer Light Technology Co. Ltd. PBDB-T and IEICO were purchased from Solarmer Co. Ltd. All these commercially available materials were used as received without further purification.
Precursor preparation
1.3 M PbI2 and 101 mg DMSO were dissolved in 1 ml DMF, and then stirred for 5 hours. 50 mg CH3NH3I was dissolved in 1 ml of isopropanol. TiO2 paste (Dyesol paste 30 nm) and ethanol were prepared at a mass ratio of 1:7.5 followed by stirring for 8 hours. 10 mg ml−1 PBDB-T:IEICO was dissolved in chlorobenzene with a D:A mass ratio ranging from 1:1 to1:0.6, and the solution was stirred at 50 °C for 5 hours. A volume ratio of 2% DIO was added into PBDB-T:IEICO solution 30 min before BHJ film deposition.
Solar cell fabrication
Patterned glass coated with 2 mm width FTO was successively ultrasonically cleaned twice with detergent, water, deionized water, and isopropanol. Then 10 ml of TIPD/ethanol (v:v 1:9) solution was sprayed onto the pre-cleaned and dried FTO substrate using oxygen as the carrier gas and then sintered at 450 °C for 30 minutes to obtain a compact TiO2 (c-TiO2) layer. mp-TiO2 was obtained by spin-coating the TiO2 (Dyesol, 30 nm particle paste) precursor on c-TiO2 at 5000 rpm for 30 s with post successive drying at 125 °C for 10 min and sintering at 500 °C for 30 min. After the substrate was cooled to room temperature, 30 µl of the PbI2 precursor was spin-coated on the mp-TiO2 substrate at 3000 rpm for 30 s. Subsequently, 60 µl of CH3NH3I was spin-coated on wet PbI2 at 3000 rpm for 30 s in a nitrogen-filled glovebox, and then the unfinished film was taken out from the glovebox for the following annealing treatment on a 100 °C hot platform for 30 min in ambient air with humidity less than 30%. For the ISCs, the organic active layer was prepared by spin-coating PBDB-T:IEICO chlorobenzene solution with different mass ratios on the CH3NH3PbI3 film at 2000 rpm for 55 s, and then annealed at 100 °C for 10 min. The thickness of the organic layer was unified to 110 nm for all ISCs, and the thickness of the perovskite film is about 360 nm. Finally, 10 nm MoO3 and 100 nm Ag were thermally deposited on the CH3NH3PbI3/PBDB-T:IEICO layer under a base pressure of 3 × 10−4 Pa successively.
Instrumentation and characterization
The UV-vis absorption spectra were recorded using a Shimadzu UV-3600 system. The vertical component distribution for the photoactive layer was obtained by using a time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometer (TOF-SIMS) 5 from ION-TOF GmbH. The surface morphologies of pure CH3NH3PbI3, pure PBDB-T, and pure IEICO and the blend films of PBDB-T:IEICO with different weight ratios were analyzed using an Agilent 5500 atomic force microscope (AFM) operated in the tapping mode under an ambient atmosphere at room temperature. The surface potential measurements were also carried out on the same AFM using the standard scanning Kelvin probe microscopy (SKPM) mode. Time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) was tested by using a steady/transient state fluorescence spectrometer F900 from Edinburgh Instruments. The J–V characteristics were measured using a computer controlled Keithley 2400 source meter. Light was provided by a SAN-EI (AAA grade) solar simulator with standard sunlight AM 1.5 G (100 mW cm−2) and calibrated with a standard Si solar cell. The EQE was measured by using QE-R systems (Enli Tech.). All the devices for J–V and EQE measurements are unencapsulated and have an active area of 4 mm2 defined by perpendicular FTO and Ag electrodes.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1 shows the ISC with an architecture of FTO/c-TiO2/mp-TiO2/MAPbI3/PBDB-T:IEICO/MoO3/Ag, and Fig. 1b presents the molecular structures of PBDB-T and IEICO. As the absorption spectra in Fig. 1c demonstrate, the front MAPbI3 is used as a UV–vis harvesting layer, and the rear BHJ layer is introduced as an NIR absorbing layer besides absorbing UV-vis light that has not been completely absorbed by the perovskite layer. Clearly, the PBDB-T:IEICO BHJ layer absorbs NIR light up to 900 nm beyond the absorption edge of the perovskite layer. Correspondingly, the absorption onset of ISCs shifts to 900 nm and exhibits the complementary characteristic. Therefore, a high photocurrent output is highly anticipated contributing to the extended NIR photo-response and improved UV-vis light harvesting.

The schematic energy level diagram of the ISCs is plotted in Fig. 1d. The highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMOs) of PBDB-T (−5.31 eV)34 and IEICO (−5.32 eV)35 are more positive than that of MAPbI3 (−5.43 eV),24 and consequently holes generated in the perovskite layer can be scavenged by the BHJ film to the corresponding Ag anode through the anode buffer layer of MoO3, which possesses an electron blocking barrier and can collect holes selectively. It is emphasized that electrons generated in the perovskite layer can be easily extracted by the ITO cathode owing to the high electron mobility of the perovskite film, and thus the charge recombination loss in the perovskite film is negligible. Similarly, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of MAPbI3 (−3.90 eV) is more negative than that of PBDB-T (−3.12 eV)34 and very close to that of IEICO (−3.95 eV),34 and the electrons generated in the BHJ can easily transport to the perovskite with the help of the energy offset, and then are collected by the ITO cathode via the TiO2 film, which can selectively block the hole to the anode and realize electron extraction. Meanwhile, holes dissociated at the PBDB-T/IEICO interface transport through the MoO3 layer and are collected by the Ag anode. Hence, it seems that there are no obstacles for charge transport from the energy level diagram.
However, the vertical component distribution also plays a crucial role in charge transport, and two kinds of potential recombination losses induced by inappropriate vertical component distribution will seriously decrease device performance, as shown in Fig. 2a. The recombination losses are as follows: (1) holes generated in the perovskite should transport through the interpenetrating network of the electron donor material (PBDB-T) to the MoO3/Ag anode, but they travel to electron acceptor materials and trigger severe recombination with electrons generated in the BHJ layer (recombination “1” in Fig. 2a); and (2) though holes generated in the perovskite transport to PBDB-T, the recombination (recombination “2” in Fig. 2a) still occurs due to the unsuitable network of donor materials, or is ascribed to the vertical stratification of donor and acceptor materials. Hence, constructing a rational interpenetrating network of the organic photoactive layer, which can reduce two kinds of recombination probability and assure smooth charge transport (as shown in Fig. 2b), is the objective of the present study.

Our design concept of constructing a bi-continuous interpenetrating network of the organic photoactive layer in ISCs is based on the following: (1) the MAPbI3 film harvests the majority of sunlight in the range of 300–800 nm, and the PBDB-T:IEICO blend film only absorbs NIR sunlight in the range of 800–900 nm as well as a small amount of UV-Vis light escaping through the perovskite layer;23,34 (2) the perovskite films show high electron and hole mobility, and charge recombination loss is minimal in perovskite films;33 and (3) the aforementioned recombination mechanism illustrates that the charge recombination loss mainly occurs within the BHJ film. Therefore, the collection of holes generated in the perovskite seems more important, and the construction of a continuous donor interpenetrating framework and the restriction of its vertical stratification step into the breach.
The strategy of reducing the acceptor ratio in the BHJ film is applied to build a bi-continuous donor interpenetrating framework. The ISCs containing the blend films of PBDB-T:IEICO with ratios of 1:1, 1:0.9, 1:0.8, 1:0.7 and 1:0.6 were prepared and time-of-flight secondary-ion mass spectroscopy (TOF-SIMS) was performed to ascertain the vertical component distribution. The concentration distribution of PBDB-T, IEICO and MAPbI3 in the photoactive layer can be directly demonstrated by the intensity signal of S2−, CN− and I− since they are the typical species of PBDB-T, IEICO and MAPbI3.36–39Fig. 3a and b present the depth profile of S2− and CN− for two typical ISCs with ratios of PBDB-T:IEICO = 1:1 and 1:0.7, respectively. Fig. 3c and d show the corresponding three-dimensional concentration profiles of S2−, and Fig. 3e and f show the corresponding three-dimensional concentration profiles of S2− and CN− in the blend films. As can be seen from Fig. 3a, the S2− intensity in devices with PBDB-T:IEICO = 1:1 is apparently lower than that of the cell with PBDB-T:IEICO = 1:0.7 within the first 100 seconds, and it remains almost constant from 100 to 500 s in both cells. Correspondingly, the CN− intensity in the former device is evidently higher than that of the latter cell within the first 100 seconds, and the CN− intensity in the device with PBDB-T:IEICO = 1:0.7 remains almost the same from 0 to 500 s (Fig. 3b). When the sputter time is beyond 500 seconds, both intensities of S2− and CN− decrease linearly. These results clearly manifest two aspects: the first is that IEICO is accumulated in the upper section of the former device and its bottom section gathers more IEICO than that of the latter device; the second is that the vertical component distributions of PBDB-T and IEICO in the latter cell are more continuous and uniform.
 Fig. 3  Depth profile of (a) S2− and (b) CN− in two typical ISCs with ratios of PBDB-T:IEICO = 1:1 and 1:0.7; three-dimensional concentration profile of S2− in ISCs with ratios of (c) PBDB-T:IEICO = 1:1 and (d) PBDB-T:IEICO = 1:0.7; three-dimensional focus profile of S2− and CN− in PBDB-T:IEICO blend films with ratios of (e) 1:1 and (f) 1:0.7. Depth profile of S2−, CN− and I− in PBDB-T:IEICO blend films with ratios of (g) 1:1 and (h) 1:0.7. 
The three-dimensional vertical concentration profile of pure S2− in Fig. 3c and d distinctly shows the different distributions of PBDB-T in the two typical devices, where blue dots represent PBDB-T. Fig. 3e and f further confirm that the network of the organic active layer is the vertical stratification for ISCs with PBDB-T:IEICO = 1:1, and the network of the organic active layer is bi-continuous and uniform for ISCs with PBDB-T:IEICO = 1:0.7, in which blue dots represent PBDB-T and red dots indicate IEICO. According to the potential recombination mechanism discussed before, it is reasonable to conclude that the vertical stratification network is detrimental to hole collection, and the uniform bi-continuous interpenetrating network of the photoactive layer is favorable for smooth charge transportation. Fig. 3g and h further record the depth profile of I− in ISCs with ratios of PBDB-T:IEICO = 1:1 and 1:0.7, respectively. It can be seen that the I− level increases rapidly when the sputter time is over 400 s, indicating that this section of the ISCs is the perovskite film.
To verify and quantitatively compare the vertical component distribution between PBDB-T and IEICO within the active layer, the surface potential (SP) measurements of pure PBDB-T, pure IEICO, MAPbI3 and PBDB-T:IEICO with different ratio ranges from 1:1 to 1:0.6 were investigated employing the SKPM mode of atomic force microscopy with a scanning size of 5 μm × 5 μm, as shown in Fig. 4. The SPs of pure PBDB-T, pure IEICO and MAPbI3 are 200 (Fig. 4a), 305 (Fig. 4c) and 955 mV (Fig. 4e), respectively. The blend films of PBDB-T:IEICO with ratios of 1:1, 1:0.9, 1:0.8, 1:0.7 and 1:0.6 are 268 (Fig. 4g), 257 (Fig. 4i), 251 (Fig. 4k), 248 (Fig. 4m) and 243 mV (Fig. 4o), respectively. Clearly, the SP of 268 mV for the PBDB-T:IEICO blend film is more close to that of the pure IEICO with a SP of 305 mV compared to that of the pure PBDB-T with a SP of 200 mV, manifesting that IEICO enriches at the top surface of the organic photoactive layer, which will cause serious recombination (recombination “2” in Fig. 2b) due to the discontinuous network of the donor materials. Furthermore, the SPs of blend films decrease gradually with the ratio of IEICO decreasing to 0.6, demonstrating that the component distribution of PBDB-T increases and a more continuous interpenetrating network of the donor material is constructed while too low proportion of IEICO definitely leads to a discontinuous framework of IEICO resulting in lower charge separation efficiency caused by insufficient exciton dissociation,40 thus reducing device performance. These observations are in good agreement with the SIMS results, and support the proposed strategy for restricting vertical stratification and forming a bi-continuous interpenetrating network for efficient ISCs.

Their nanoscale morphologies are observed using the tapping mode of AFM, and there is no noteworthy change for their root mean square (RMS) roughness. The pure PBDB-T and pure IEICO exhibit more smooth surfaces with a RMS roughness of 7.07 (Fig. 4b) and 7.84 nm (Fig. 4d), respectively, whereas the MAPbI3 film has a relatively uneven surface, with a RMS roughness of 9.98 nm (Fig. 4f). But the surface roughness of the MAPbI3 film did not influence the surface topology of the organic blend films, and the blend films of PBDB-T:IEICO with ratios of 1:1, 1:0.9, 1:0.8, 1:0.7 and 1:0.6 are 6.39 (Fig. 4h), 6.94 (Fig. 4j), 7.36 (Fig. 4l), 6.57 (Fig. 4n) and 6.97 nm (Fig. 4p), respectively, indicating that the BHJ morphology does not critically rely on the vertical component distribution. However, the charge transport strongly depends on the vertical component distribution of the active layer.39

Fig. 5a plots the J–V curves of ISCs with different donor/acceptor ratios. The detailed solar cell performance parameters are compared in Table 1 under 100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5 G simulated irradiation. It must be pointed out that the data are averaged over 12 individual devices. Apparently, the devices with PBDB-T:IEICO = 1:1 exhibit the lowest PCE of 12.63%, with a poor fill factor (FF) of 55.13%, a Jsc of 21.82 mA cm−2 and a Voc of 1.05 V. When the ratio of IEICO in the organic photoactive layer decreases, all parameters pass through a maximum value at PBDB-T:IEICO = 1:0.7. As the ratio of IEICO decreases from 1 to 0.7, the Jsc and FF increase significantly, with a slight increase in the Voc, leading to the maximum PCE of 15.47%, with the highest FF of 62.55%, a Jsc of 23.10 mA cm−2 and a Voc of 1.07 V. This indicates that the uniform interpenetrating network of the organic photosensitive layer plays a vital role in smooth charge transport, and further favors the achievement of efficient ISCs. When the ratio of IEICO reduces to 0.6, the performance parameters reduce obviously, and the devices have a PCE of 13.73%, with a FF of 59.77%, a Jsc of 21.68 mA cm−2 and a Voc of 1.06 V. This suggests that the unbalanced electron extraction and hole collection occur because of the component reduction of IEICO. Therefore, we may conclude that a reasonable ratio between the electron donor and acceptor materials is beneficial to construct a uniform interpenetrating network of the organic photoactive layer in ISCs.41

The corresponding EQE spectra for the above-mentioned devices are shown in Fig. 5b. Apparently, the UV-vis section mainly comes from the perovskite cell and the EQE spectrum from 755 to 900 nm mostly comes from the BHJ cell, indicating that the photo-response is extended to 900 nm by integrating the PBDB-T:IEICO based BHJ and MAPbI3 layers. Furthermore, the EQE values ranging from 400 nm to 700 nm increase firstly and then decrease when the weight ratio of PBDB:IEICO changed from 1:1 to 1:0.6, and a maximum is passed through at PBDB-T:IEICO = 1:0.7, which suggests that the capability of hole transportation increases firstly and then decreases with the changing network of the BHJ. The ISC with PBDB-T:IEICO = 1:0.7 demonstrates a much stronger photo-response and shows a much higher EQE value than that of other devices within the wavelength ranging from 400 to 700 nm, which can be ascribed to the fact that the rational bi-continuous interpenetrating network of donor/acceptor materials offers independent pathways for electron and hole transportation, and especially guarantees the smooth transport of holes generated in the perovskite. Consequently, the carrier recombination is significantly reduced and the FF of ISCs increases obviously. But the photo-response from 780 nm to 900 nm also declines obviously as the weight ratio of PBDB-T:IEICO is decreased from 1:1 to 1:0.6, which means an insufficient exciton dissociation occurs caused by the reduction of the acceptor within the BHJ layer and the increased deviation of the donor/acceptor weight ratio from the optimal value of 1:1.42 Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the donor interpenetrating network gradually forms by reducing the weight ratio of PBDB-T:IEICO to 1:0.7, which is favorable for the smooth transportation of holes generated in the perovskite film; but further reducing the donor/acceptor ratio to 1:0.6 causes geminate losses within the BHJ layer.39 For the above-mentioned Jsc, the integrated photocurrents from EQE curves for ISCs with PBDB-T:IEICO = 1:1, 1:0.9, 1:0.8, 1:0.7 and 1:0.6 are 21.30, 21.98, 22.37, 22.87 and 21.21 mA cm−2, respectively, which are in accordance with the Jsc measured from J–V curves within a mismatch of less than 3%. These results confirm that constructing a desired bi-continuous interpenetrating network of the BHJ is crucial for ameliorating the trade-off between the smooth transportation for holes generated in the perovskite and the complete exciton dissociation within the BHJ layer.
To check the reproducibility of ISCs by optimizing the vertical component distribution, 12 devices were investigated and the statistical FF, Jsc and PCE are shown in Fig. 5c–e. As expected, these parameters show a reasonable standard deviation, indicating a reproducible photovoltaic performance. The FF, Jsc and PCE all reach the maximum value at PBDB-T/IEICO = 1:0.7, and these parameters show the lowest value when the PBDB-T/IEICO ratio is 1:1. The average FF values for ISCs with PBDB-T:IEICO = 1:1, 1:0.9, 1:0.8, 1:0.7 and 1:0.6 are 55.13%, 57.63%, 60.06%, 62.57% and 59.77%, respectively. The corresponding Jsc and PCE demonstrate a similar variation trend, which is in accordance with the results discussed in the previous sections and supports the proposed mechanism.
TRPL measurements were carried out to evaluate the charge transport between MAPbI3 and PBDB-T:IEICO. Three sets of samples of MAPbI3, PBDB-T:IEICO and MAPbI3/PBDB-T:IEICO films were investigated with an excitation wavelength of 485 nm and an emission wavelength of 790 nm (Fig. 5f). TRPL curves are fitted with a bi-exponential function and the detailed fitting parameters are summarized in Table 2, in which the short lifetime τ1, the long lifetime τ2 and the average lifetime τavg correspond to the fast decay process related to trap-assisted recombination, the slow decay process related to radiative recombination and the sum of τ1 and τ2, respectively. As can be seen, the average lifetime τavg values of MAPbI3 and MAPbI3/PBDB-T:IEICO films with weight ratios of 1:1 and 1:0.7 are 54.79, 4.12 and 3.55 ns, respectively, indicating that the charge transfer between the perovskite and the BHJ layer is more effective at the weight ratio of 1:0.7 though the τavg of MAPbI3/PBDB-T:IEICO is slightly lower than that of PBDB-T:IEICO (2.84 ns).24

Conclusion
In conclusion, we have successfully fabricated efficient perovskite/BHJ ISCs with enhanced FF and NIR harvesting via constructing a bi-continuous interpenetrating network within the organic photoactive layer based on the analysis of two potential recombination losses. The TOF-SIMS and SKPM evidently confirm that fine-tuning the electron donor/acceptor ratio can effectively restrict the vertical stratification and build the desired vertical component distribution within the BHJ to ensure smooth charge transportation. TRPL spectroscopy reveals the efficient charge transfer process between the MAPbI3 perovskite film and the low bandgap PBDB-T:IEICO organic blend films. Benefiting from the in-depth understanding of the charge transport process, adopting the low bandgap PBDB-T:IEICO and employing accurate countermeasures to fine-tune the BHJ network, the absorption spectrum of MAPbI3/PBDB-T:IEICO based ISCs is broadened to 900 nm and Jsc is increased from 21.82 to 23.11 mA cm−2, leading to an enhanced PCE from 12.65% to 15.47% while obtaining a high FF (62.57%) and maintaining Voc (1.07 V). This work provides a feasible strategy for optimizing the morphology of the BHJ absorber and therefore suppressing charge recombination for efficient perovskite/BHJ ISCs.
