    , Accepted 16th March 2021First published on 17th March 2021AbstractBecause of the emergence of small-molecule acceptors with acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) structures, organic solar cells (OSCs) have developed rapidly in recent years. Currently, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of the OSCs based on A–D–A acceptors exceed 18%, much higher than those of the fullerene-based OSCs. Nonetheless, the photovoltaic performances of OSCs still lag behind inorganic and perovskite solar cells due to more serious energy losses. Herein, in order to reveal the energy loss mechanisms at the molecular level, we have investigated the geometric structures of the ground (S0), excited (S1), and anionic (A−) states as well as the mutual transitions among these electronic states for a series of A–D–A acceptors with fully fused rigid or non-fused flexible donor units. The results show that the fully fused molecules have planar backbones in all the electronic states, while the non-fused molecules are much distorted at S0, and become less twisted at S1 and A−. Consequently, compared with the non-fused A–D–A acceptors, the fused ones generally have smaller reorganization energies for each electronic transition, leading to reduced voltage and current losses. In addition, extending the donor unit lengths is beneficial for reducing charge recombination and facilitating charge transport. These results indicate that design and optimization of large fused A–D–A acceptors would be an effective way to further improve the organic photovoltaic performance.
1. Introduction
In recent years, non-fullerene small molecule acceptors (SMAs) with acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) structures have developed rapidly and made a new breakthrough for organic solar cells (OSCs).1–13 To date, the highest power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) have reached 18% for OSCs based on A–D–A SMAs.14,15 Nonetheless, the OSCs still lag behind inorganic and perovskite solar cells due to bigger energy losses.16–18 The photoelectric conversion in OSCs consists of the following optoelectronic processes:19–21 (1) light absorption to form excitons; (2) exciton diffusion to the donor/acceptor interface; (3) exciton dissociation to generate electron and hole charge carriers; (4) charge transport to the respective electrodes; (5) charge collection by the electrodes. Thus, to improve the efficiencies of OSCs, it is imperative to gain a molecular understanding of the energy loss pathways in these optoelectronic processes.
As shown in Fig. 1, the geometry relaxation in the lowest singlet excite state (S1) upon light absorption constitutes a part of voltage loss, and the decay of the S1 excitons to the ground state (S0) during the exciton diffusion process brings about a current loss. The energy level offsets between the donor and the acceptor, which serve as the driving forces for exciton dissociation, can also lead to a voltage loss.22 According to the Marcus theory,23,24 the smaller the reorganization energy, the smaller the driving force required for exciton dissociation. There are two types of exciton dissociation pathways: (i) electron transfer from the excited-state donor to the ground-state acceptor, D(S1)A(S0) → D+A− and (ii) hole transfer from the excited-state acceptor to the ground-state donor, D(S0)A(S1) → D+A− to generate holes on the donor (D+) and electrons on the acceptor (A−). During the migration of charge carriers towards the electrodes, the recombination of holes and electrons into the ground states, D+A− → D(S0)A(S0), will result in both voltage and current losses. Therefore, the mutual transitions among the S0, S1, and charged states play a decisive role in the photoelectric conversion and energy loss processes for OSCs.

The backbones of A–D–A SMAs are composed of an extended π-conjugated electron-donating unit end-capped with two electron-withdrawing groups. Bulky side chains are appended on the central donor unit to increase the solubility and prevent oversized molecular aggregation in the solid phase. As known, the molecular rigidity has a great influence on the electronic dynamics, especially on the nonradiative processes. Herein, we focus on the A–D–A acceptors with fully fused and incompletely fused (non-fused) donor units. Although some non-fused A–D–A acceptors can have good photovoltaic performance,25–42 the PCEs of the OSCs based on the fused A–D–A SMAs are generally superior to those based on the non-fused ones. To understand the different photovoltaic performances among these OSCs, we have calculated the geometric and electronic structures as well as the dynamics of mutual transitions between the S0, S1, and A− states for a series of fused A–D–A SMAs of FDICTF,43 IT-4F,7 IC-C6IDT-IC,3 and ITIC,1 in comparison with non-fused A–D–A SMAs of DC-IDT2T,44 IDTBR,45,46 DICTF,47 and FBR45 (see the chemical structures in Fig. 2). The calculations show that the increased rigidity of the fused A–D–A acceptors is intrinsically beneficial to reduce the voltage and photocurrent losses and provide better performance.

2. Computational details
In the calculations, the alkyl chains in the A–D–A molecules were replaced by methyl groups for simplification. The most stable conformations of the end-groups of 2-(3-oxo-2,3-dihydroinden-1-ylidene)malononitrile (IC) or rhodanine with their adjacent moieties of thiophene or benzothiadiazole in the molecules were first determined to be the O⋯S conformer or S⋯H conformer by the relaxed scan (Fig. S1, ESI†). Then geometry optimizations and frequency analyses of all the molecules were performed by using density functional theory (DFT) for the S0 and A− states and by using time-dependent DFT (TDDFT) for the S1 state. Here, the long-range corrected functional ωB97XD48 and the 6-31G(d,p) basis set were employed. The range-separation parameter ω was optimally determined according to a gap-tuning procedure,49–54 namely, by minimizing the following J2 value: J2 = JIP2 + JEA2(1) JIP = |εH(N) + E(N − 1) − E(N)|(2) JEA = |εH(N + 1) + E(N) − E(N + 1)|(3)Here, N is the number of electrons in the neutral molecules; εH(N) and εH(N + 1) are the energies of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) for the molecules in the neutral and anionic states; E(N), E(N − 1), and E(N + 1) are the total energies of the molecules in the neutral, cationic, and anionic states, respectively. For each molecule, the ω value (Table S1, ESI†) and the ground-state geometry are iteratively optimized until converged. The vibrational frequencies of the optimized geometries for the S0, S1, and A− states are all positive, indicating that all the obtained geometries are stable. The relaxation energies for the electronic transitions among the S0, S1, and A− states were calculated by using the potential energy surface method, namely, the energy difference between the initial and final equilibrium geometries on the final state surface. All the above calculations were carried out with the Gaussian 16 program.55
3. Results and discussion
Geometric and electronic structures
The optimized S0-geometries are symmetric, with the dihedral angles between the central donor unit and the end-groups (D1) being very small (≤0.1°) for the fused A–D–A acceptors and relatively larger (ca. 8° between rhodanine and benzothiadiazole) for the non-fused acceptors (Table 1). Moreover, for the non-fused SMAs, the additional dihedral angles between the single-bond linked moieties of the donor units (D2) appear to be significant. The TDDFT calculations based on the S0-geometries point out that the S0 → S1 excitations for all the molecules are dominated by the transition from the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) (H → L) with a proportion of 68–88% and the H−1 → L+1 configuration contributes 8–25% (Table S1, ESI†). The calculated vertical excitation energies for DICTF and FBR are relatively much higher than the other compounds. This is consistent with the experimental data obtained from the peak wavelengths of absorption spectra in the solution and film phases (Table S2, ESI†), although the calculated results are somewhat overestimated due to the lack of the environmental polarization and molecular aggregation effects. Because the HOMO is mainly distributed on the central donor units while the LUMO is distributed more on the end-groups (Fig. 3), the S1 state will possess an important intramolecular charge transfer character. Although the dipole moments of S1 are very small due to the molecular symmetry, the transition dipole moments of S0 → S1 are quite strong, leading to large oscillator strengths and hence strong light absorption of A–D–A SMAs observed in experiments.

It should be noted that the HOMO has no distribution on the single bonds connecting the non-fused moieties of the donor units, whereas the distribution becomes very significant for the LUMO. Thus, these bonds in the S1 state have a slight double-bond property, which is beneficial to decrease the torsion in the molecular backbones. Compared with S0, the A− state can be simply thought to have one more electron in the LUMO, so the A−-geometries are similar to the S1-geometries. In a word, for the compounds of FDICTF, IT4F, IC-C6IDT-IC and ITIC with fused rigid donor units, the molecular backbones are always planar in the S0, S1, and A− states. In contrast, for the non-fused compounds of IC-IDT2T, IDTBR, DICTF and FBR, the S0-geometries are twisted, but the twists get smaller for the S1 and A−-geometries and almost disappear except for FBR. We note that the symmetry is broken for the A−-geometry of DICTF and for the S1 and A−-geometries of FBR, leading to two different D1 and D2 angles in the respective geometries. The D2 angles in the S1 and A− states are still very large for FBR due to the big steric hindrance between benzothiadiazole and the six-membered benzene ring.
Mutual transitions between S0 and S1
The mutual transitions between the S0 and S1 states are related to the light absorption, exciton decay, and exciton diffusion processes. According to the Franck–Condon principle, the molecular geometry remains fixed at the instant of electronic transition, and then the system relaxes from the equilibrium geometry of the initial state down to that of the final state along the potential energy surface of the final state. The excited-state relaxation from the S0-geometry to the S1-geometry upon light absorption constitutes an important source of voltage loss. As shown in Fig. 4 and Table S3 (ESI†), the reorganization energies of the fused molecules FDICTF, IT4F, IC-C6IDT-IC and ITIC are very small (ca. 0.1 eV), and the reorganization energies on the S0 and S1 potential surfaces are very similar. For the non-fused systems, the reorganization energies are gradually increased with the ground-state D2, ranging from 0.11 to 0.22 eV. Despite the medium change in D2, FBR has the most distorted molecular backbone and the largest reorganization energies. This can be due to the larger bond length changes that are mainly on one of the benzothiadiazole moieties (see Fig. S2 and S3, ESI†).
 Fig. 4  Reorganization energies for the S0 → S1 transition (light absorption) and the S1 → S0 transition (nonradiative exciton decay). The sum of them corresponds to the reorganization energy for excitation energy transfer. 
For the studied A–D–A acceptors, the oscillator strengths (f) for the S0 → S1 transition are very strong (2.18–3.27) (Table S1, ESI†), which is beneficial to enhance the light absorption. It is worth mentioning that because of a more planar and conjugated backbone, the fused FDICTF molecule can have an obviously stronger absorption (f = 3.10) than the non-fused DICTF (f = 2.25). In turn, the radiative decay is unavoidable for the photovoltaic systems. According to the Einstein spontaneous emission relation,56 the fluorescence rate is proportional to the oscillator strength and the square of vertical emission energy (kF = fEvert2/1.499), and is estimated to be on the order of 108 s−1 for all the A–D–A molecules. Thus, it is important to decrease the non-radiation rate for reducing the exciton decay. Apparently, the transition energy is much bigger than the reorganization energy in the S1 → S0 transition. Consequently, the fused systems will have lower nonradiation rates due to the smaller reorganization energies according to the Marcus theory.23,24
The exciton diffusion process consists of a series of Förster-type excitation energy transfer (EET), in which the energy donating molecule transforms from S1 to S0 while the energy accepting molecule transforms from S0 to S1. The sum of the relaxation energies on the S0 and S1 potential surfaces corresponds to the reorganization energy for the excitation energy transfer (λEET = λS0→S1 + λS1→S0). Since the total energy is conserved, the excitation energy transfer is an energy self-exchange process. According to the Marcus theory,23,24 the smaller the λEET, the faster the exciton transfer rate. Assuming the same exciton coupling values, the EET rate at room temperature for FDICTF is 20 times higher than FBR due to the smaller λEET (Fig. S4, ESI†).
In bulk heterojunction OSCs, the size of the pure phase is controlled by morphological optimization, and the excitons generated by light absorption are expected to avoid decaying to the ground state and reach the interface as soon as possible. However, the pure phase is not only related to exciton diffusion, but also to charge transport and recombination. If the pure phase size is too small, although the excitons can diffuse to the interface, this will greatly increase the interface and lead to a poor charge transport network and severe recombination. For given donor and acceptor materials, the optimal active layer morphology should be able to balance exciton diffusion and charge transport to maximize the cell efficiency. Compared with the non-fused A–D–A acceptors, the fused systems not only show lower voltage and photocurrent losses caused by the excited-state relaxation and decay, but also show faster EET rates and longer exciton diffusion distances. Accordingly, the fused systems are also beneficial to reduce the difficulty of morphology optimization and improve the device stability.
Transition from S1 to A−
We recall that the acceptor excitons are dissociated at the donor/acceptor interfaces through hole transfer, in which the acceptors undergo the S1 → A− transition and the donors undergo the S0 → D+ transition. Whether the A–D–A molecules are of a fused rigid or non-fused flexible structure, the geometries for the S1 and A− states are similar. As a result, the reorganization energies of all the studied molecular acceptors are very small, in the range of 0.051–0.073 eV (Fig. 5 and Table S3, ESI†). The very small reorganization energy means that the excitons can be dissociated efficiently under a low driving force. This is beneficial to reduce the voltage loss in the exciton dissociation process, thus resulting in high photovoltaic performance for the OSCs based on the A–D–A molecular acceptors.
 Fig. 5  Reorganization energies for the S1 → A− transition (corresponding to the dissociation of acceptor excitons via hole transfer, charge generation path ii). 
Mutual transitions between S0 and A−
The transitions between the S0 and A− states are related to the charge generation path i, charge transport, and charge recombination. For the non-fused A–D–A molecules, the conjugated backbones are more planar in the A− state than in the S0 state, and hence the geometry changes are more significant compared with the fused systems. Consequently, the reorganization energies for the transitions between the S0 and A− states are generally smaller for the fused systems with respect to the non-fused systems (Fig. 6 and Table S3, ESI†), which is beneficial to reduce recombination loss and promote electron transport. Indeed, from the non-fused DICTF to fused FDICTF, the voltage loss is relatively decreased and the electron mobility is increased for the organic solar cells using PBDB-T as an electron donor.43 The exception is the fused molecule IC-C6IDT-IC, which has much larger reorganization energy than the other fused molecules and some non-fused systems. This can be ascribed to the short conjugation length of the donor unit.
 Fig. 6  Reorganization energies for the S0 → A− transition (corresponding to the dissociation of donor excitons via electron transfer, charge generation path i) and the A− → S0 transition (corresponding to the charge recombination process). The sum of them corresponds to the reorganization energy of electron transport. 
In the charge generation path i, the excited-state donor gives an electron to the ground-state acceptor, so the acceptor molecules undergo the S0 → A− transition. The reorganization energy for this transition is calculated to be 0.116–0.189 eV and is larger than that in charge generation path ii. Fortunately, the donor materials have a wide bandgap, which can provide enough driving force for electron transfer from the donor to the acceptor. More interestingly, Karuthedath et al. point out that the donor excitons will transfer to the acceptors via long-range EET before they diffuse to the interfaces.57 Therefore, the charge generation path ii plays a critical role in determining the photoelectric efficiencies for the OSCs based on A–D–A acceptors.
When the charge carriers migrate toward the electrodes, some of them can recombine, leading to energy losses. In the recombination process, the negatively (positively) charged acceptor (donor) loses (receives) an electron and returns to the neutral ground state, i.e., A− → S0 (D+ → S0). The reorganization energies for the A− → S0 transition show a similar trend as those of the S0 → A− transition, and the former are slightly larger than the latter for all the A–D–A molecules except for IDTBR. At the same time, the sum of the reorganization energies for the S0 → A− and A− → S0 transitions corresponds to the reorganization energy of the electron transport process. Noting that the charge-transfer state excitation energy is much larger than the charge-recombination reorganization energy and charge transport is an electron self-exchange process, the smaller reorganization energy is beneficial to obtain both slower charge recombination rate and faster electron transport rate according to Marcus theory.23,24 Therefore, increasing the backbone rigidity and conjugation length can simultaneously reduce charge recombination and promote charge transport for an improved photovoltaic performance.
4. Conclusions
In summary, we systematically investigated the photoelectric processes for a series of A–D–A acceptors with fully fused or non-fused donor units to elucidate the intrinsic impact of molecular rigidity on the energy losses in OSCs. The results show that the fused acceptor molecules have planar backbones in all the involved electronic states, while the non-fused molecules are very distorted in the S0 state, and become less twisted in the S1 and A− states. Consequently, in the processes of light absorption and exciton diffusion, the reorganization energies of the rigid fused molecules are substantially smaller than those of the flexible non-fused ones, which is beneficial to reduce the voltage loss caused by the excited-state relaxation and increase the exciton diffusion length and photocurrent. Because of similar geometries of the S1 and A− states, the reorganization energies for the process of exciton dissociation via hole transfer are very small for all the A–D–A acceptors, which is beneficial to obtain efficient charge generation under a low driving force. In addition, the A–D–A acceptors with a larger fused donor unit exhibit smaller reorganization energies upon negative charging and vice versa, which is beneficial to suppress charge recombination and promote charge transport. These results emphasize the importance of molecular rigidity on reducing the voltage and current losses for high-efficiency OSCs.
Currently, some non-fused A–D–A acceptors with noncovalent conformation locks (NCLs) can also show very good photovoltaic performance.25,26,33–35,39,42 This is because NCLs are able to enhance the molecular planarity and rigidity. Furthermore, the geometric changes can be restrained by increasing the intermolecular interactions in the solid phase to improve the performance of non-fused systems. Nonetheless, our calculations elucidate the influence of molecular intrinsic properties and provide useful insights into the molecular design of high-performance organic photovoltaic materials.
