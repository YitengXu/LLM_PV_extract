    , Accepted 8th January 2018First published on 9th January 2018AbstractPlasmon resonance describes a phenomenon that enhances optical absorption of visible light at solid interfaces coated with organic materials. This stronger light absorption in thin films may increase the efficiency of solar cells, photocatalysis and organic electronics. Metal nanoparticles and organic molecules have very different values of specific extinctions making it extremely difficult to control the enhancement effect and to study the mechanism of this enhancement. Herein, we report the first direct observation of plasmon enhanced absorption at the organic-coated interfaces by using self-assembled gold aggregates with a tunable structure. Precise control of the spectral properties of these aggregates makes it possible to use them as plasmonic antennas for nanometer-thick layers of organic dyes on solids. When deposited on top of the ultrathin layers of various dyes (mono- and double-decker tetra-15-crown-5-phthalocyanines and 5-carboxytetramethylrhodamine), the light-trapping enhancers with resonantly adjusted plasmon coupling can boost their absorption by more than 500% in a wide range of wavelengths (520–660 nm) and in a wavelength-selective manner. However, this plasmonic effect strongly depends on the aggregation state of the dyes in the interfacial film. Whereas plasmon enhancement of absorption occurs in non-aggregated systems, it is completely quenched at interfaces with aggregated dyes such as perylene diimide or tetrapyridyl porphyrin, which exhibit optically collective behavior. Computer modeling showed that the relative arrangement of the nanoparticles with respect to the organic dyes on the supporting solid controls the propagation of the enhanced plasmonic field and the occurrence of the plasmon enhancement effect. Our findings provide new insight into the interaction of light and complex interfaces that might allow the rational design of plasmon-enhanced optical materials.
Introduction
The well-known ability of noble metal nanoparticles (NPs) to produce strong electromagnetic fields near their surface due to light-induced excitation of plasmon resonance1–5 leads to surface-enhanced spectroscopic effects for molecules, which are trapped within this field. Surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS),6–8 surface-enhanced fluorescence (SEF)9 and surface-enhanced infrared absorption (SEIRA),7 all based on the surface plasmon enhancement, are currently applied for routine chemical analysis and biosensing approaching single-molecule detection for a wide range of compounds.2
Plasmon resonance enhanced absorption (PREA),10–12 is a related effect based on the excitation of localized surface plasmons (LSP) in the UV-vis spectral range, but difficult to directly observe. The difference between the specific extinction of dye molecules and of metal nanoparticles may reach orders of magnitudes (see Section S1, ESI†) and therefore typically masks the enhanced signal from light-absorbing molecules.
This is why experimental studies of PREA are much less advanced with respect to other plasmon-enhanced optical phenomena, although the effect has been progressively used in applications, which exploit solar energy conversion, such as dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSC),13–18 organic polymer solar cells19–26 and UV-vis photocatalysis.27,28 In these systems, the PREA effect generated by nanoparticles either on surfaces or in the thin (interfacial) layers of planar functional elements of solar light convertors29–32 has rarely been measured directly. Instead, it has been derived from the increased output of associated processes, for instance, the photocatalytic cleavage and formation of chemical bonds (for a comprehensive review, see ref. 27), photodegradation of organic compounds,33–39 visible-light photocurrent of water splitting40–43 and photocatalytic CO2 reduction.44 The embedding of noble metal nanoparticles into the polymer solar cell or DSSC systems can improve their power conversion efficiency as well.19,45,46
To rationalize the application of PREA at interfaces, researchers have followed simple empirical rule: an overlap of the spectra of the absorbing material with those of the nanoparticles and the light source is necessary to achieve maximal absorption enhancement.47,48 In most cases, the spectrum of the nanoparticles is adjusted to that of the organic absorbing materials by adjusting their size or shape during the fabricating procedure.5 Spectral modulation by plasmon coupling is used rarely and, in many cases, it applies so-called plasmonic back-reflectors, which are prepared by lithography and represent an array of holes located at certain distances from each other on the metal surface.13
Herein, we suggest a new strategy, which makes it possible to measure the PREA effect at solid interfaces coated with ultrathin organic films directly. To achieve full spectral overlapping, our approach manipulates plasmon coupling in the self-assembled 2D arrangements of gold nanoparticles. As PREA sensitizers, we used structurally tunable plasmonic antennas – 18 nm gold nanoparticles stabilized in the optically transparent crystalline film of fatty surfactants.49 These assemblies form spontaneously through a colloid-induced condensation of a catanionic mixture of stearic acid (SA) and octadecylamine (ODA) on a surface of gold hydrosol (Fig. 1, for detailed discussion on the mechanism of colloid-induced condensation, see ref. 50). Adsorption of nanoparticles at the interface promotes the growth of crystalline islands of surfactants both on the surface and around the entrapped AuNPs until most of the spread organic material undergoes transformation into a solidified film. The aggregation of nanoparticles into a stabilized continuous network manifests itself in the progressively changing optical properties due to plasmon coupling. By using a fiber-optic spectrometer, it is possible to control the position of the maximum of the surface plasmon band (SPB) in such film-entrapped colloidal assemblies with a nanometer precision in a range of more than a hundred nanometers (520–660 nm). The structure with desirable optical characteristics can be then transferred from the liquid surface onto the solid support with deposited organic layers via dip coating.
 Fig. 1  Schematically illustrated fabrication process for ultrathin hybrid systems with plasmon-resonance enhanced absorption. (a and b) A solid support with a deposited layer of water-insoluble dye is immersed into the gold hydrosol and a mixture of surfactants is spread on to the surface of gold colloidal solution. (c and d) When the plasmonic layer with appropriate spectral parameters is formed, it is deposited onto the solid-supported layer of dyes. The resulting hybrid structure comprises an ultrathin organic absorption layer and stable film-like plasmonic enhancer. 
Our method thereby avoids expensive lithography or modulation of the size and shape of nanoparticles to achieve spectral matching between the plasmonic antennas (PAs) and absorbing organic layers on solid surfaces. By using different organic dyes, we demonstrate the ability of such PAs to enhance significantly the efficiency of light trapping as well as to broaden the absorption range of organic surface coatings with originally narrow-band spectral patterns. Because it combines a small thickness of organic films with a precise control of LSP absorption in the PAs on top of these films, this interfacial architecture allows a direct observation of the PREA effect. Therefore it was possible to reveal the sensitivity of interactions between collective plasmons and organic material to its aggregation state in the ultrathin surface film. We found that plasmon-induced non-additive optical behavior occurs only at interfaces coated with condensed homogeneous films, in which the dye molecules do not experience strong and optically cooperative intermolecular interactions. For thin organic layers of J-aggregates exhibiting collective optical behavior, their integration with plasmonic assemblies does not lead to the enhancement of J-aggregate optical extinction and the resulting spectral patterns of such hybrids are precisely additive. A possible origin of the observed structural sensitivity of plasmon–organic interactions at interfaces is discussed on the basis of computer simulation data.
Results and discussion
Bottom-up assembly of layered nanostructures
To fabricate ultrathin hybrids with enhanced ability of trapping visible light, we used several water-insoluble organic dyes (Fig. 2) preliminary ordered into monolayers at the air/water interface and then transferred onto the supports by vertical Langmuir–Blodgett deposition. This method was applied as a convenient deposition technique for fabricating monomolecular films of water-insoluble organic compounds. The dyes were selected specifically to achieve an overlapping between their spectral characteristics in thin films and the excitation range of plasmon coupling in gold PAs.
 Fig. 2  Structures, schematic drawings and UV-vis spectra of the monolayers of organic chromophores used in this study: (a) ruthenium tetra-(15-crown-5)-phthalocyaninate derivative RuL(EIN)2, (b) 5-carboxytetramethylrhodamine (TAMRA), and (c) cerium bis[tetra-(15-crown-5)-phthalocyaninate] (CeL2) (e) N,N′-bis(3-pentyl)perylene-3,4,9,10-bis(dicarboximide) (EP-PDI), (d) 5,10,15,20-tetra(4-pyridyl)-21H,23H-porphine (TPyP). For the spectra of these compounds in chloroform, see Fig. S1, S8, S14, S22 and S26 (ESI†) respectively. 
For modulating light trapping at the long-wavelength limit of PAs, RuL(EIN)2 with maximal absorption at 645 nm51,52 in the ordered monolayer on solid surface is most suitable (Fig. 2a and see also Section S2, ESI†). TAMRA absorbing light at 560 nm in the film was selected as a dye matching the short-wavelength range of PAs excitation (Fig. 2b and see also Section S3, ESI†). Finally, CeL2 was used as a multiband chromophore, which is capable of absorption in two spectrally separated regions matching the extinction range of PA. For this compound, maximal absorption in a monolayer on solid support – at 525, 640 and 700 nm (Fig. 2c and see also Section S4, ESI†), respectively.53 Two other compounds, EP-PDI and TPyP, were used as well-known strong chromophores, which can form J-aggregates.54–56 After aggregation at the air/water interface, these compounds give films with maximal absorption in a visible range of interest at 495 and 546 nm and 520, 553, 590 and 657 nm, respectively (Fig. 2d and e and see also Sections S5, S6, ESI†).
PAs with the spectral characteristics matching those of the dye films were transferred from the surface of colloidal solution onto the supports with the already deposited chromophores (Fig. 1b). To provide best control of the instrumental factor, the spectra of the films on solids were routinely measured at every step of the fabrication process by two independent instruments, fiber optic reflection/absorption spectrometer and by a two-beam UV-vis spectrometer. The thickness and morphology of the monolayers on solids were examined by atomic force microscopy (AFM); the structure of control PA sensitizers on a surface of clean quartz glass and that of the dye/PA hybrid films were compared by scanning electron microscopy (SEM).
PREA at interfaces presenting single-band chromophores
Two studied chromophores, RuL(EIN)2 and TAMRA, exhibit single absorption maxima in the visible range and they both form condensed arrangements in thin films at the interface.
For RuL(EIN)2 dye with bulky ligands coordinated to its metal core, the AFM examination of the control dye coating on the mica surface gave a thickness of about 2 nm, which corresponds to a monolayer arrangement of chromophore molecules in a tilted orientation with respect to the surface plane (Fig. 3a).57,58 This thin layer absorbing at 645 nm (Fig. 3c, curve 1) was coupled with the appropriately tuned single-component gold PA with strong extinction near the red spectral limit for such gold colloidal assemblies. The SEM image of the surface of RuL(EIN)2 film coated by the PA with suitable spectral characteristics, that is, maximal LSP absorption at 630–640 nm (Fig. 3c, curve 2), shows a percolated network-like morphology, which extends uniformly over the available area of the support (Fig. 3b).
 Fig. 3  (a) AFM image and corresponding surface profile of the scratched region in the RuL(EIN)2 monolayer transferred onto mica support. (b) SEM image of PA structure on a surface of RuL(EIN)2 film. Insert: Schematic drawing of a hybrid RuL(EIN)2/PA structure. (c) UV-vis spectra of RuL(EIN)2 coating (1), control PA of AuNPs (2) and hybrid RuL(EIN)2/PA bilayer (4); curve 3 represents a calculated spectral sum of 1 and 2. Curve 5 shows the spectrum of a 3-layer film of the same dye with deposited PA. The control spectrum of the 3-layer film is omitted for clarity; for the full set of spectra, see Fig. S5 (ESI†). 
Additive optical behavior of the resulting bilayer would theoretically correspond to a curve 3 representing a sum of the spectrum of the dye film and that of the PA. Curve 4, which is the experimentally measured spectrum of RuL(EIN)2/PA hybrid system shows, however, a significantly enhanced absorbance of the resulting structure.
The relative coefficient of this enhancement Ke can be calculated as an integral ratio of the experimental spectrum (curve 4) to the theoretical one (curve 3).
The obtained value of Ke = 2.2 indicates non-additive optical behavior of the hybrid in a range of wavelengths 400–800 nm and it suggests the enhancement of the efficiency of light trapping at the interface by more than 100%. No enhancement occurred, however, in the region of the Soret band at the 324 nm which does not overlap with the extinction spectrum of PA (for the enlarged detailed spectra in the range of wavelengths 300–450 nm, see Fig. S6, ESI†). This observation suggests that the spectral overlapping is necessary for the onset of the plasmon enhancement effect.
SEM examination of the hybrid and control PA gave the same average number of nanoparticles (Fig. S7, ESI†), that is, the extra absorption is not due to the quantitative difference in plasmonic sensitizers. The non-additive optical behavior of the RuL(EIN)2/PA hybrid film is therefore a result of plasmon-resonance enhanced absorption. To prove this assumption, the hybrid system comprising a thicker 3-layer film of RuL(EIN)2 and the same PA structure was formed and measured (Fig. 3c, curve 5).
The comparison of the spectra of hybrid systems with different thickness shows, that their absorbance increased proportionally to the number of deposited monolayers of RuL(EIN)2. The relative coefficients of this enhancement Ke are 2.2 and 6.3, respectively, indicating an increase of the absorption efficiency in a thicker film by more than 500%. This observation confirms that the film, which is 6 nm thick, is permeable for the plasmon field and that the optical properties of the hybrid system are determined by the plasmon resonance enhancement of the light absorbance in the layer of the organic dye and not by the change of the plasmonic properties of AuNPs.
The optical properties of AuNPs and their aggregates are known to depend on the dielectric properties, in particular, on the refractive index of the environment. The replacement of the homogeneous aqueous environment of AuNP in a colloid solution to the interface between the air and dye layer on the solid support does not significantly influence the extinction, i.e., both absorption and scattering of the AuNP, because the effective refractive index of the media does not significantly increase (see Fig. S27, ESI† as an example). Numerical calculation of the model system confirms this assumption (see Section S7, ESI†).
The results suggest that the tunable configuration of PAs allows efficient field concentration and energy transfer between the plasmonic nanoparticles and a layer of densely packed chromophore molecules.
A similar PREA effect was directly observed in the system based on a TAMRA monolayer, which shows an intense absorption band at 560 nm. The dye coating had a thickness of ∼1.2 nm (Fig. S11, ESI†), which, when taken together with a molecular area of 50 Å2 (Fig. S9, ESI†) determined from the compression curve, is in agreement with the calculated theoretical one for the monolayer of non-stacked rhodamine fragments with alkyl tails projected from the surface. To complete the hybrid structure, we used the PA with a strong extinction at 550 nm49 (for details, see Section S3.1, ESI†).
The spectral measurements provided evidence of the 175% enhancement of light trapping at the interface covered with this bilayer structure with respect to the theoretical additive value (Fig. S13, ESI†).59
PREA in films of multiband-absorbing chromophore
The tunable structure of PAs offers the opportunity to manipulate the optical properties of ultrathin layers of multiband chromophores in a selective manner with respect to the absorption wavelength. As an example, we used thin films of CeL2 exhibiting a number of well-defined optical absorption bands (Fig. 2c and 4a–c).53,60,61 Control AFM measurements of the monomolecular film on the mica surface gave a thickness of 0.8 nm that corresponds to a face-on arrangement of CeL2 molecules on the solid support (for AFM image and surface profile, see Fig. S17, ESI†).61
 Fig. 4  (a–c) UV-vis spectra of CeL2 films with deposited PAs having tuned position of LSP band at: (a) 635 nm, (b) 532 nm, and (c) 550 and 650 nm, respectively. Curves 1a and b correspond to CeL2 monolayer, curve 1c – to a bilayer, respectively; curves 2a–c refer to control PAs of AuNPs; curves 3a–c correspond to hybrid CeL2/PA structures; curves 4a–c represent calculated spectral sums of 1 and 2. (d–f) SEM images of PAs on the surface of CeL2 monolayers on the silicon wafers. The resulting structures are drawn schematically. For the detailed spectra of 4c, see Fig. S20 (ESI†). 
To measure enhanced absorption at selected wavelength, we applied two different PAs. First one showed maximal extinction at 635 nm (Fig. 4a, curve 2 and Fig. 4d), which is very close to the spectral position of 640 nm for the left shoulder in a Q-band of the CeL2 (Fig. 2c and 4a, curve 1). The PREA effect in this hybrid system corresponds to the relative enhancement coefficient KE 1.35 (Fig. 4a, curves 3 and 4, respectively).
Another gold PA with LSP position at 532 nm (Fig. 4b, curve 2 and Fig. 4e) in combination with the monolayer of CeL2 gave the hybrid system with the maximal absorbance at 545 nm (Fig. 4b, curve 3). The position of spectral maximum is red-shifted from 526 nm at which the charge transfer band of the CeL2 dye originally appears. The shift indicates, most likely, a certain degree of gold-induced photodestruction of the organic material.62,63 For the resulting CeL2/PA hybrid, the PREA effect was larger than that observed at longer wavelength; the value of the relative enhancement coefficient KE was 1.86. In both systems, the extinction in the region of the Soret band, which has no overlap with the range of plasmon excitation in PAs, changed as it would be expected for the additive optical behaviour of the hybrid films (Fig. S18, ESI†).
The spectrum of any PA represents a combination of longitudinal and transverse LSP extinctions. Therefore it is also possible to select a structure with spectral positions of both maxima matching to those of organic material to increase them simultaneously in the same hybrid system.
This option was demonstrated by using non-aggregated dendritic chains of AuNPs, exhibiting most intense extinction near the charge transfer band and the Q-band of the chromophore and thereby increasing them both in the bilayer organic film (Fig. 4c and f; for a full set of spectra for monolayer and bilayer systems, see Fig. S19, ESI†).
Our results showed that the magnitude of the PREA effect at dye-coated interfaces varies to a certain degree in different systems and it varies at different wavelengths for the same chromophore. These variations, which were reproducibly observed, may relate to different spatial distributions of the PA-enhanced electromagnetic field with respect to the dye molecules at the frequency corresponding to their absorbance bands.
Plasmonic antennas on surfaces with deposited J-aggregates
The sensitivity of the PREA effect to the intermolecular interactions in ultrathin organic films manifested itself most dramatically for the interfaces presenting J-aggregates. To assemble such hybrid structures, we used well-known dyes, EP-PDI and TPyP, which are both capable of formation of J-aggregates in thin films64 with optical absorption in the range of interest. The films of aggregated dyes with deposited PAs were formed using the procedure described above for condensed assemblies of chromophores, which do not exhibit cooperative behavior. Fig. 5a and c show the AFM images for the resulting dye/PA hybrids with typical morphology of aggregated organic structures64 (for fluorescent images of control organic surface coatings, see Fig. S25 and S27, ESI†).
 Fig. 5  (a) AFM image and corresponding profile of hybrid EP-PDI/PA structure, (b) UV-vis spectra of EP-PDI monolayer (1), control PA of AuNPs with maximal absorbance at 550 nm (2), and hybrid EP-PDI/PA structure (3); curve 4 represents a calculated spectral sum of 1 and 2, (c) AFM image and corresponding profile of hybrid TPyP/PA structure, (d) UV-vis spectra of TPyP monolayer (1), control PA of AuNPs with maximal absorbance at 575 nm (2), and hybrid TPyP/PA structure (3); curve 4 represents a calculated spectral sum of 1 and 2. 
Gold PAs with spectral characteristics matching those of organic films are present on top of the aggregated organic phase as well as on the aggregate-free surface of the support. However, this presence of nanoparticles does not lead to non-additive optical properties of hybrid assemblies. Both structures show spectra, which precisely correspond to an additive optical behavior of the mixture of components (Fig. 5b and d). The resulting spectral pattern suggests for PAs in combination with J-aggregates at the interface, that plasmonics assemblies do not interact specifically with the organic material beneath them.
The mechanism of this phenomenon needs further thorough investigations including theoretical modeling, which is beyond the scope of this study. Based on the available literature data and numerical simulation of the simplified systems (see Section S8, ESI†), we nevertheless can hypothesize that the sensitivity of PREA towards the intermolecular interactions at interfaces may relate to the arrangement of AuNPs and layers of dye on the nanometer scale.
In J-aggregates all molecules presumably adopt a vertical or tilted orientation in stacked arrangements, considering their formation by applied lateral pressure on the aqueous subphase prior to their transfer onto the solids. However, the double-decker complex CeL2, which cannot form J-aggregates, can be placed in face-on or edge-on arrangements on the surface of solids in a controlled manner.61 The results for face-on arrangements were discussed above; the data for PREA in tightly packed edge-on monolayer are given in Fig. S21 (ESI†). For the CeL2-based system presenting the molecules with vertical orientation, the PREA effect increased with respect to that in face-on system, most likely, because of the relative increase of the amount of deposited material in densely packed film. The orientation of aromatic dyes with respect both to the interface and to the electric vector of the plasmon-enhanced near field plays a minor role, if at all, in modulating the effect. Strong intermolecular interactions, which manifest themselves in collective optical behavior, are necessary for quenching the plasmonic effect.
In non-aggregated condensed films of dyes, the interactions between molecules are comparable with those between molecules and nanoparticles. For a single AuNP “immersed” at a certain depth into the organic layer, the FDTD simulations show that the enhanced optical near field is localized around the particle and it propagates both into the air and into the dye layer (Section S8 and Fig. S32, ESI†). The dye molecules absorb this enhanced field. These dye-field interactions lead to non-additive increase of absorption. We hypothesize that this geometry of a contact between the AuNPs and the dye layer may occur in the non-aggregated organic films due to the displacement or even partial squeezing of the dye molecules from the surface in a course of the atop transferring of the PAs.
The characteristic absorption spectra of J-aggregates are fully determined by strong intermolecular interactions within the aggregated structure. These interactions are significantly stronger than those between AuNPs and the aggregates are. Gold nanoparticles can stick to the surface of the J-aggregate rather than penetrate into it. Otherwise, the intercalation of AuNPs into the aggregate would cause its destruction, which, in turn, would lead to an unavoidable change of the absorption spectrum of aggregated chromophores. The simulations showed that, for the AuNP sticking on a surface of the dye layer, the enhanced near field is localized above the interface between the air and organic material (Fig. S33, ESI†). This relative displacement of the enhanced field from the organic film manifests itself in the additive optical behavior of J-aggregates with deposited gold nanoparticles.
There are therefore two possible optical patterns for the assemblies of AuNPs at the organic-coated planar interfaces: (i) the plasmon enhanced absorption of chromophores, which do not exhibit collective optical behavior, and (ii) the additivity of spectral properties of AuNPs and the dyes, which form optically collective structures such as J-aggregates.
Conclusions
In summary, we have described a new strategy for the direct observation of plasmon resonance enhancement of the absorption of visible light in ultrathin organic films at solid interfaces. Unlike the most common approach to influence optical properties of plasmonic structures by changing their chemistry, size or shape, our method uses precise structural control of the plasmon coupling in gold PAs. The tunability of plasmon sensitizers made it possible to achieve significantly enhanced and broadened absorption at organic-coated interfaces by using dyes with narrow-band spectral patterns. The method therefore avoids chemical modification of dyes or specific selection of appropriate combinations of dyes to achieve the same effect.
The direct measuring of the effect allows studying the interplay between the structure of the organic interface interacting with plasmonic particles and the magnitude of these interactions.
We showed for the first time that the magnitude of the PREA effect varies in chemically and structurally different hybrid systems. Most dramatically, this sensitivity manifests itself at interfaces presenting J-aggregates, which exhibit optically collective behavior. For these systems, their coupling with resonantly tuned plasmonic structures did not lead to the enhancement of optical properties; instead, the spectral patterns of J-aggregates with deposited gold nanoparticles remained precisely additive. We demonstrated that non-additive absorption due to a plasmon resonance effect occurs only in condensed organic thin films, which do not exhibit optically collective behavior. This sensitivity of the effect with respect to the aggregation state of organic chromophores originates, most likely, from the spatial arrangement of components that controls the permeability of the enhanced near field of the particles into the interfacial organic layers.
In summary, our results provide significant new insight into the interactions between light and complex nanostructures. Further investigations of this aspect will offer an opportunity to achieve a better understanding of the complex nature of plasmon-associated effects at interfaces and can be useful for rationalizing fabrication of organic-based optical nanodevices; our group actively pursues this goal.

 	Fig. 1  Schematically illustrated fabrication process for ultrathin hybrid systems with plasmon-resonance enhanced absorption. (a and b) A solid support with a deposited layer of water-insoluble dye is immersed into the gold hydrosol and a mixture of surfactants is spread on to the surface of gold colloidal solution. (c and d) When the plasmonic layer with appropriate spectral parameters is formed, it is deposited onto the solid-supported layer of dyes. The resulting hybrid structure comprises an ultrathin organic absorption layer and stable film-like plasmonic enhancer.	 

 	Fig. 2  Structures, schematic drawings and UV-vis spectra of the monolayers of organic chromophores used in this study: (a) ruthenium tetra-(15-crown-5)-phthalocyaninate derivative RuL(EIN)2, (b) 5-carboxytetramethylrhodamine (TAMRA), and (c) cerium bis[tetra-(15-crown-5)-phthalocyaninate] (CeL2) (e) N,N′-bis(3-pentyl)perylene-3,4,9,10-bis(dicarboximide) (EP-PDI), (d) 5,10,15,20-tetra(4-pyridyl)-21H,23H-porphine (TPyP). For the spectra of these compounds in chloroform, see Fig. S1, S8, S14, S22 and S26 (ESI†) respectively.	 

 	Fig. 3  (a) AFM image and corresponding surface profile of the scratched region in the RuL(EIN)2 monolayer transferred onto mica support. (b) SEM image of PA structure on a surface of RuL(EIN)2 film. Insert: Schematic drawing of a hybrid RuL(EIN)2/PA structure. (c) UV-vis spectra of RuL(EIN)2 coating (1), control PA of AuNPs (2) and hybrid RuL(EIN)2/PA bilayer (4); curve 3 represents a calculated spectral sum of 1 and 2. Curve 5 shows the spectrum of a 3-layer film of the same dye with deposited PA. The control spectrum of the 3-layer film is omitted for clarity; for the full set of spectra, see Fig. S5 (ESI†).	 

 	Fig. 4  (a–c) UV-vis spectra of CeL2 films with deposited PAs having tuned position of LSP band at: (a) 635 nm, (b) 532 nm, and (c) 550 and 650 nm, respectively. Curves 1a and b correspond to CeL2 monolayer, curve 1c – to a bilayer, respectively; curves 2a–c refer to control PAs of AuNPs; curves 3a–c correspond to hybrid CeL2/PA structures; curves 4a–c represent calculated spectral sums of 1 and 2. (d–f) SEM images of PAs on the surface of CeL2 monolayers on the silicon wafers. The resulting structures are drawn schematically. For the detailed spectra of 4c, see Fig. S20 (ESI†).	 

 	Fig. 5  (a) AFM image and corresponding profile of hybrid EP-PDI/PA structure, (b) UV-vis spectra of EP-PDI monolayer (1), control PA of AuNPs with maximal absorbance at 550 nm (2), and hybrid EP-PDI/PA structure (3); curve 4 represents a calculated spectral sum of 1 and 2, (c) AFM image and corresponding profile of hybrid TPyP/PA structure, (d) UV-vis spectra of TPyP monolayer (1), control PA of AuNPs with maximal absorbance at 575 nm (2), and hybrid TPyP/PA structure (3); curve 4 represents a calculated spectral sum of 1 and 2.
