    , Accepted 28th May 2012First published on 1st June 2012AbstractHerein, we report two new cationic iridium(III) homodinuclear structures linked through a diyne moiety at the 5-position of the bipyridyl ligand (1,4-di(2,2′-bipyridin-5-yl)buta-1,3-diyne) and compare these to mononuclear model systems bearing a 5-ethynyl-2,2′-bipyridine ligand. Low energy bands observed in the absorption spectra point to charge-transfer transitions for all four complexes, with these bands red-shifted in the case of the two dinuclear complexes. Electrochemical studies show metal-centred oxidation and ligand-centred first reduction potentials. In the case of the dimer bearing 2-phenylpyridine (ppyH) cyclometallating ligands, cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements reveal two one-electron oxidation waves and a corresponding reduction in the HOMO–LUMO gap (ΔEred-ox) compared to a mononuclear system, pointing to a significant electronic coupling between the two iridium(III) metals. The room temperature emission spectrum of this dimer is also bathochromically shifted, corroborating the CV data. In the case of the iridium dimer bearing 2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)-5-methylpyridine (dFMeppy) ligands, only a single one-electron oxidation wave is observed, but with the expected smaller ΔEred-ox value, compared to its mononuclear counterpart. The emission spectra at room temperature are generally broad and featureless with only modest quantum efficiencies (ΦPL = 1.4–8.4%) in 2-methyltetrahydrofuran (2-MeTHF) solution. All complexes emit at 77 K with lifetimes on the order of 4 μs. A combined density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT (TDDFT) study reveals that the emission process is best described as a mixed metal-to-ligand/ligand-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT/LLCT).
Introduction
Both neutral and cationic iridium(III) complexes of the form (C^N)2Ir(L^X), where C^N is a cyclometallating ligand such as the anion of 2-phenylpyridine (ppy) and L^X is either an anionic or neutral bidentate ligand such as acetylacetone (acac) or 2,2′-bipyridine (bpy), have each been the object of intense study over the past decade.1 The tremendous interest in these two classes of complexes stems from the improved photophysical properties compared to complexes of other metals.1b,c,2 Notably, the emission energy of iridium(III) complexes can be readily tuned through synthetic modification of the ligands, which is made more facile when the complex is heteroleptic, the photoluminescent and electroluminescent quantum efficiencies are very high, approaching unity for fac-Ir(ppy)3 and its derivatives. Moreover, the iridium(III) complexes are thermally stable and relatively chemically inert. In particular, cationic iridium complexes have been incorporated into a wide variety of applications from light-emitting electrochemical cells (LEECs) for use in large-scale flat panel lighting,3 to chemosensors,4 to biolabelling agents,5 to solar fuels6 and as photosensitizers for organic transformations.7 Most of these studies have concentrated on mononuclear complexes.
Taking into account the rich number of examples of polymers that include iridium(III),8 there is in fact a paucity of examples of oligohomonuclear iridium complexes, of which only a small subset include charged iridium centers (Chart 1). The scarcity of literature examples stems in part from the inefficient syntheses and nontrivial purifications that were the object of several early investigations. These oligonuclear complexes are promising candidates for opticoelectronic devices and solar energy conversion.9 To the best of our knowledge, Haasnoot, Balzani and co-workers were the first to explore homodinuclear iridium complexes.10 As part of a more exhaustive study, they explored a neutral di-iridium complex, 1, with the metals bridged through a 3,5-bis(pyridin-2-y1)-1,2,4-triazole. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) studies indicate that the two Ir centers are electronically coupled through the HOMO with irreversible oxidation waves at 1.13 and 1.30 V vs. SCE in acetonitrile (ACN). Similarly, Tsuboyama and co-workers reported a dinuclear complex with iridium centers bridged through a 1,4-bis(pyridin-2-yl)benzene unit (2).11 They observed a large red-shift in the 298 K emission spectrum (λem 665 nm) compared to fac-Ir(ppy)3 with a photoluminescent quantum efficiency, ΦPL, one order of magnitude lower at 4%. Bruce and co-workers recently reported on a series of green-yellow, highly luminescent (ΦPLca. 50% in DCM) dinuclear metallomesogens bearing a tetraacetylethane bridging ligand.12 Lee, Do and co-workers elongated the bridging ligand, employing a 1,3-bis(3-phenyl-3-oxopropanoyl)benzene, towards the study of dinuclear complex 3.13 The resulting photophysical behavior pointed to an electronic decoupling between the two metals while the first oxidation was found to occur through a 2-electron process. By contrast, even though they employed a similar spacer geometry, placing the iridiums 7.47 Å apart, Calborean, Mazzanti and co-workers14 demonstrated the 298 K emission profile for neutral piconilate-derived bis(iridium) complexes 4a–4b to be slightly red-shifted and with ΦPL and τe reduced compared to mononuclear systems. DFT calculations demonstrated that for each of 4a and 4b, the LUMO spans the bridging 2,2′:6′,2′′-terpyridine-6,6′′-dicarboxylic acid, implying a significant electronic communication between metal centers. The shortest bridging group reported to date is a cyanide ligand, which promoted the formation of a highly luminescent tetranuclear assembly, [{Ir(ppy)2(CN)}4], with photophysical and electrochemical properties reminiscent of the mononuclear cyanide complex.15

Neve, Campagna and co-workers investigated two cationic homodinuclear iridium complexes with metals linked through a diarylester-type moiety.16 In their two examples (5a and 5b), cyclic voltammetry studies demonstrated a two-electron oxidation process at ca. 1.18 V vs. SCE, an indication that the two iridium centers are electronically decoupled, while the intensity of the metal-to-ligand charge transfer (1MLCT) absorption bands were found to be additive compared to mononuclear analogs and the existence of photoluminescent energy transfer could not be conclusively assigned from an analysis of their luminescent properties. De Cola and co-workers investigated two homodinuclear systems (6 and 7a) wherein the two iridium centers were linked through an oligo(para-n-phenylene) spacer (n = 3, 4).17 As in the previous study, absorption bands were found to be twice as intense in 6 and 7a compared to a mononuclear compound while their luminescence and transient absorption profiles indicate weak electronic coupling between metal units. Replacement of the ppy ligands with 2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)pyridines (dFppy) (7b) results in an expected blue-shift in emission from 606 to 546 nm.18 Biexponential decay kinetics was observed at both 77 and 298 K, attributed to an additional contribution from the photoluminescentally active bridge.
Barbieri, Collin, Sauvage and co-workers19 described a cationic bimetallic complex (8), employing a 3,8-dipyridyl-4,7-phenanthroline bridging ligand, wherein they were able to isolate each of the three diastereomers through the use of a chiral counterion. The photophysical behaviour for the three diasteromers was found to be identical with λem at 654 nm in ACN solution with a 295 K ΦPL and τe, of ca. 0.6% and 46 ns, respectively, implying conjugation throughout the ancillary ligand and electronic coupling between the two metals. Bolink, Ortí and co-workers recently investigated the incorporation of dinuclear assemblies (9a–9b) for LEEC applications.20 Owing to the nature of the bridging unit, the two metal centers are electronically decoupled with emission found to be very weak due to the non-innocence of the bridge. Oddly, the electrochemical gap for the two are not manifestly dissimilar, implying that the first oxidation is not localized about the iridium, unlike most cationic iridium complexes, a conclusion supported by DFT calculations, which place the HOMO on the conjugated linker. Two-layer LEEC devices operating at 3 V were found to be poorly luminescent (10 cd m−2) with external quantum efficiencies (EQE) on the order of 0.13%.
Recently, Chandrasekhar, Bera et al. isolated a series of cationic dinuclear and trinuclear assemblies.21 Photophysical characterization for a trinuclear assembly bridged through two naphthyridine–triazole ligands reveals a somewhat electronically coupled set of iridium metals, evidenced by the red emission, bathochromically shifted compared to a mononuclear model system.21a The same group more recently reported a series of bridged dinuclear iridium complexes (bridging ligands including 1,2-bis(4-pyridyl)ethane (bpa), 1,3-bis(4-pyridyl)propane (bpp), trans-1,2-bis(4-pyridyl)-ethylene, (bpe) N,N′-bis(2-pyridyl)methylene-hydrazine, (abp) N,N′-(bis(2-pyridyl)formylidene)ethane-1,2-diamine, (bpfd).22 Solely in the cases of the dimer incorporating conjugated ligand motifs (bpe or abp) was some electronic coupling observed by CV studies.
Quici and co-workers,23 Whittle and Williams24 and Barigelletti, Collin and co-workers25 have each investigated dinuclear bis(terdentate) iridium systems. In the former case, the binding motif about each Ir was identical and spanned through a m-terphenyl unit with clear indication that the two Ir metals do not communicate with each other. In the latter two cases, several dimetallic assemblies were investigated with oligo(para-n-phenylene) bridging units (n = 2, 3). Similar to that observed by De Cola and co-workers,18 the p-phenylene spacer was found to be photophysically non-innocent. When the two iridiums possess the same coordination environment, markedly reduced electronic communication was observed.24a,25 However, when two iridiums possessed different coordination environments and oxidation states, CV and PL studies implied a substansive interaction between the two Ir metals with weak emission at 607 nm.24b Not surprisingly, when the bridging p-phenylene is removed, electronic coupling is substantially reinforced.25
From this survey of the polyhomonuclear iridium complex literature, with but two exceptions (e.g., 4a, 4b)14,24b assemblies exhibiting hybrid photophysical behavior with electronically coupled iridiums are limited to examples with polytopic heterocyclic ancillary ligands. Herein, we report two structurally related examples of homodinuclear complexes (11 and 13) possessing hybrid photophysical and electrochemical behavior (Chart 2). Their properties are contrasted with respective mononuclear model systems (10 and 12). A combined density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT (TDDFT) study points to conjugation through the ancillary ligand, affecting the LUMO energy and promoting a significant red-shift in the emission spectrum.

Commercial chemicals were used as supplied. All experiments were carried out with freshly distilled anhydrous solvents obtained from a Pure SolvTM solvent purification system from Innovative Technologies except where specifically mentioned. Triethylamine (Et3N), N,N-diisopropylamine (i-Pr2NH) were distilled over CaH2 under a nitrogen atmosphere. CuI,26 [(ppy)2Ir-μ-Cl]2,27 [(diFMeppy)2Ir-μ-Cl]2,28 2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)-5-methylpyridine,29 5-bromo-2-iodopyridine,5 5-bromo-2,2′-bipyridine,30 5-trimethylsilylethynyl-2,2′-bipyridine,30 and 5-ethynyl-2,2′-bipyridine,30 were purified or prepared following literature procedures. Complexes 10 and 12 were formed following respective dimer cleavage with 5-ethynyl-2,2′-bipyridine, following the procedure of Nonoyama.27 All reagents wherein the synthesis is not explicitly described were purchased and used without further purification. Flash column chromatography was performed using silica gel (Silia-P from Silicycle, 60 Å, 40–63 μm). Analytical thin layer chromatography (TLC) was performed with silica plates with aluminum backings (250 μm with indicator F-254). Compounds were visualized under UV light. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance spectrometer at 400 MHz and 100 MHz, respectively, Bruker Avance spectrometer at 300 MHz and 75 MHz, respectively or a Varian INOVA spectrometer at 600 MHz and 151 MHz, respectively. The following abbreviations have been used for multiplicity assignments: “s” for singlet, “d” for doublet, “t” for triplet and “m” for multiplet. Deuterated chloroform (CDCl3) or acetonitrile-d3 (CD3CN) were used as solvents of record. Melting points (Mps) were recorded using open-end capillaries on a Meltemp melting point apparatus and are uncorrected. GC-MS samples were performed on a Shimadzu QP 2010 Plus equipped with a HP5-MS 30 m × 0.25 mm ID × 0.25 μm film thickness column. High resolution mass spectra were recorded on either a VG Micromass ZAB-2F or a Waters Synapt MS G1 (ESI-Q-TOF) at the Université de Sherbrooke.

Photophysical characterization. 
All samples were prepared in 2-methyltetrahydrofuran (2-MeTHF), which was distilled over CaH2 under nitrogen or in HPLC grade acetonitrile (ACN) for the external reference, [Ru(bpy)3](PF6)2. Absorption spectra were recorded at room temperature and at 77 K in a 1.0 cm capped quartz cuvette and an NMR tube inserted into a liquid nitrogen filled quartz dewar, respectively, using a Shimadzu UV-1800 double beam spectrophotometer. Molar absorptivity determination was verified by linear least squares fit of values obtained from at least three independent solutions at varying concentrations with absorbances ranging from 0.01–2.6. Steady-state emission spectra were obtained by exciting at the lowest energy absorption maxima using a Horiba Jobin Yvon Fluorolog-3 spectrofluorometer equipped with double monochromators and a photomultiplier tube detector (Hamamatsu model R955). Emission quantum yields were determined using the optically dilute method.31 A stock solution with absorbance of ca. 0.5 was prepared and four dilutions were prepared with dilution factors of 40, 20, 13.3 and 10 to obtain solutions with absorbances of ca. 0.013, 0.025, 0.038 and 0.05, respectively. The Beer–Lambert law was found to be linear at the concentrations of the solutions. The emission spectra were measured after the solutions were rigorously degassed with solvent-saturated nitrogen gas (N2) for 20 min prior to spectrum acquisition using septa-sealed quartz cells from Starna. For each sample, linearity between absorption and emission intensity was verified through linear regression analysis and additional measurements were acquired until the Pearson regression factor (R2) for the linear fit of the data set surpassed 0.9. Individual relative quantum yield values were calculated for each solution and the values reported represent the gradient value. The equation Φs = Φr(Ar/As)(Is/Ir)(ns/nr)2 was used to calculate the relative quantum yield of each of the sample, where Φr is the absolute quantum yield of the reference, n is the refractive index of the solvent, A is the absorbance at the excitation wavelength, and I is the integrated area under the corrected emission curve. The subscripts s and r refer to the sample and reference, respectively. A solution of [Ru(bpy)3](PF6)2 in ACN (Φr = 0.095) was used as the external reference.32 The experimental uncertainty in the ΦPL is conservatively estimated to be 10%, though we have found that statistically we can reproduce PLQYs (ΦPL) to 3% relative error. A pulsed NanoLED at 341 nm (pulse duration <1 ns; fwhm = 14 nm), mounted directly on the sample chamber at 90° to the emission monochromator, was used to excite the samples and photons were collected using a FluoroHub from Horiba Jobin Yvon single-photon-counting detector. The luminescence lifetimes were obtained using the commercially available Horiba Jobin Yvon Decay Analysis Software version 6.4.1, software included within the spectrofluorimeter.
Electrochemical characterization. 
Cyclic voltammetry were performed on an Electrochemical Analyzer potentiostat model 600D from CH Instruments. Solutions for cyclic voltammetry were prepared in ACN and degassed with ACN-saturated nitrogen bubbling for ca. 15 min prior to scanning. Tetra(n-butyl)ammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6; ca. 0.1 M in ACN) was used as the supporting electrolyte. It was recrystallized twice from EtOH and dried under vacuum prior to use. A non-aqueous Ag/Ag+ electrode (silver wire in a solution of 0.1 M AgNO3 in ACN) was used as the pseudo-reference electrode; a glassy-carbon electrode was used for the working electrode and a Pt electrode was used as the counter electrode. The redox potentials are reported relative to a saturated calomel (SCE) electrode with a ferrocenium/ferrocene (Fc+/Fc) redox couple as an internal reference (0.40 V vs. SCE).33
Computational methodology. 
Calculations were performed with Gaussian 0934 at the Université de Sherbrooke with the Mammouth super computer supported by Calcul Québec. The DFT35 and TDDFT36 were calculated with the B3LYP37 method. The 3-21G*38 basis set was used for C, H and N, and VDZ (valence double ζ) with SBKJC effective core potentials38a,39 for iridium. The predicted phosphorescence wavelengths were obtained by energy differences between the triplet and singlet optimized states (ΔSCF method).40 The calculated absorption spectra and related MO contributions were obtained from the TD-DFT/singlets output file and GaussSum 2.1.41 A THF quantum mechanical continuum solvation model was employed.42

Results and discussion
Synthesis
Mononuclear complexes 10 and 12 were obtained in good yield via cleavage of the respective μ-dichloro iridium dimers in refluxing 1:1 DCM–MeOH. The corresponding homodinuclear complexes 11 and 13 were also obtained in good yield through Glaser43 coupling reactions with two equivalents of 10 and 12, respectively, in the presence of stoichiometric CuCl under an oxygen atmosphere. The aromatic peaks within the 1H NMR spectra of 11 and 13 were broadened compared to 10 and 12, respectively, owing to the presence of diasteromeric mixture of isomers (ΛΛ, ΛΔ and ΔΔ, Fig. 1). The distinct 1H NMR signals of the methyl groups at ca. 2.2 ppm in 12 and 13 illustrate clearly the formation of the diastereomeric mixtures. Owing to the C1-symmetry of 12, the two methyls are diastereotopic and two singlets are observed. In 13, owing to the pseudo-C2 symmetry present on the NMR time scale, the four methyl groups, which are now slightly more deshielded, are discernable as two singlets. The photophysical and electrochemical characterization was conducted on the mixture as it had previously been shown that these properties are invariant with respect to stereochemistry.14,19 All complexes were fully characterized by 1H and 13C NMR, melting point determination and low- and high-resolution mass spectrometry.

Electrochemistry
Electrochemical measurements for 10–13 were obtained in ACN solution with 0.1 M n-Bu4NPF6 as the supporting electrolyte and the results are reported in Table 1 in V versus SCE with cyclic voltammograms (CVs) shown in Fig. 2. Complexes 10–13 each exhibit a reversible first metal-centred Ir(III) to Ir(IV) oxidation wave extending to the cyclometallating ligand.44 For 10, this wave is centered at 1.27 V, the same as that measured for [(ppy)2Ir(bpy)]PF6.44 There is a single reversible reduction wave at −1.21 V assigned as being localized on the bipyridyl ligand, corroborating results obtained in DCM solution by Castellano and co-workers.45 With electron-withdrawing fluorines incorporated onto the cyclometallating unit, 12, the oxidation wave is anodically shifted by 310 mV while the first reduction wave is anodically shifted to a lesser extent (80 mV). The result is an increase in the HOMO–LUMO gap of 230 mV, corroborating the blue shift observed in the 298 K emission spectra (see below).

The electrochemical profile for dimer 11 is more complex. The first oxidation is reversible and, at 1.30 V, is assigned to the Ir(III)/Ir(IV) redox couple of one of the Ir metals, analogous to the process observed for 10. A second reversible oxidation wave is observed at 1.56 V and is assigned to the oxidation of the second Ir metal. The presence of a second distinct oxidation wave is an indication that the metal moieties are in electronic communication with each other.22,46 The first reduction wave is significantly anodically shifted at −0.95 V compared to 10, indicating a substantial stabilization of the LUMO due to the increased conjugation through the bipyridyl backbone. Two other reversible reduction waves at −1.06 and −1.44 have been assigned to two further reduction events on the ancillary ligand as Castellano had previously determined that reduction processes on the cyclometallating ligand in 10 occur at much larger potentials (−1.85 V). The increase in conjugation in 11 results in an overall reduction in the HOMO–LUMO gap of 230 mV compared to 10.
For dimer 13, unlike 11, only a single pseudo-reversible 1-electron oxidation wave is observed, cathodically shifted by 40 mV compared to 12. It is conceivable that the second oxidation wave is masked by the first or alternatively it is masked by the solvent oxidation wave. The poor resolution between the first and second oxidation peaks of metal complexes linked via a diyne bridge is not unprecedented as was previously observed for diferrocenylbutadiyne.46 Three reduction waves are observed at −0.80, −1.20 and −1.41 V. The first wave is irreversible. The HOMO–LUMO gap is 2.34 V, smaller by 370 mV compared to that of 12. It is unclear why the first reduction band in 13 should be irreversible.
To summarize, the behavior observed in the electrochemical gap for each of 10–13 along with the calculated HOMO–LUMO gap (see below) point to oxidations occurring on the iridium(s) and involving the cyclometallating ligand while reductions are localized on the bipyridyl ligand, with some contribution from the metal centers. The electrochemical gap increases with the presence of electron-withdrawing fluorines and decreases in the homodinuclear complexes, due to increased conjugation imparted by the presence of the diyne bridge (see Fig. S6† for a compilation of oxidation and reduction half-wave cyclic voltammograms).
Photophysical characterization. Ground-state absorption
The normalized absorption spectra for 10–13 in 298 K air-saturated 2-MeTHF solution are shown in Fig. 3, with molar absorptivities summarized in Table 2. All four complexes show an intense band at around 260 nm, ascribed to π–π* singlet-based ligand-centered (1LC) transitions on the cyclometallating and ancillary ligands.40b In the region between 300 and 400 nm are a series of weaker bands, attributed to metal-to-ligand (bpy) charge transfer transitions (1MLCT). At lower energy are very low intensity bands that are due to spin-forbidden 3MLCT transitions, visible owing to the strong spin–orbit coupling of iridium. The absorption profile for 12, is very similar to that of 10, a complex for which we30 and others45 had previously reported its complete photophysical characterization. The presence of the electron-withdrawing fluorine atoms imparts a ca. 15 nm blue shift and a fourfold increase in molar absorptivity in the CT bands. Homodimeric complexes 11 and 13 possess 1MLCT bands that are about 20–25 nm bathochromically shifted compared to their mononuclear counterparts. Such an observed red-shift is consistent with increased conjugation on the ancillary ligand.

Emission
The 298 K and 77 K emission profiles for 10–13 were recorded in 2-MeTHF solution and are shown in Fig. 4. The emission profiles for 10–13 at 298 K are broad and featureless with λmax values spanning a range from 558 to 647 nm, attributed to a mixed ligand-to-ligand and metal-to-ligand charge transfer (3LLCT–3MLCT) involving the ancillary ligand, commonly observed for cationic heteroleptic iridium complexes40b,47 and corroborated by DFT calculations (see computational section). The emission profile for 12 is significantly blue-shifted (1770 cm−1) compared to 10 as the fluorine atoms are known to stabilize the HOMO of this class of iridium complexes.44 By contrast, a red-shift of 600 cm−1 for the emission λmax combined with broadened spectral features is observed in 11 compared to 10 due to the increase in conjugation of the ancillary ligand. Such a red-shift in emission denotes the existence of electronic communication between the two metal subunits. Oddly, the emission profile for 13 was found to be essentially identical to that for 12 at 298 K, which was not observed at 77 K. The presence of a large rigidochromic shift of the emission spectra at 77 K for 10–12 complexes indicates significant CT character during emission. Such a hypsochromic shift is expected in the glass state as reorganization of solvent molecules is inhibited in the frozen medium. Surprisingly, there is an absence of a rigidochromic shift at 77 K for 13, which, coupled with the fine structure in the emission spectrum, would seem to point to greater LC character for this complex. Indeed, the 77 K emission spectra for fluorinated complexes 12 and 13 exhibit significant fine structure while those of 10 and 11 remain featureless though their respective emission envelopes have narrowed somewhat compared to their RT emission spectra. Homodinuclear 11 and 13 exhibit emission spectra maxima that are red-shifted by 670 and 2550 cm−1, respectively, from 10 and 12. Excitation spectra for 10–13 (Fig. S1–S4†) accurately reproduce the low energy CT features found in the respective absorption spectra.
 Fig. 4  Normalized emission spectra for 10–13 in 2-MeTHF at (a) 298 K and (b) 77 K. 
Photoluminescent quantum efficiencies (ΦPL) for 11 and 13 were found to be moderately decreased compared to their mononuclear counterparts. Interestingly, unlike the comparison in photophysical behavior between [(ppy)2Ir(bpy)](PF6) (λmax = 602 nm, ΦPL = 9.3% in ACN) and [(dFMeppy)2Ir(bpy)](PF6) (λmax = 527 nm, ΦPL = 61.4% in ACN; dFMeppy = 2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)-5-methylpyridine),44 there was not the expected observed increase in ΦPL upon blue-shifting of the emission spectrum in 10vs.12. This is due to a five-fold decrease in kr, which offsets the three-fold decrease in knr. The vibrations of the ethynyl group thus seem to be an outlet for non-radiative decay. Emission intensity was found to decay monoexponentially at both 77 and 298 K, with τe at 77 K on the order of 4 μs for each of the four complexes. Lifetimes at 298 K increased modestly for homodinuclear complexes 11 and 13 (0.62 and 0.72 μs, respectively) compared to 10 and 12, respectively (0.16 and 0.51 μs, respectively). Radiative decay constants, kr, were thus found to decrease by an order of magnitude for the homodinuclear complexes, while knr values were found to decrease only slightly. Noteworthy, both ΦPL and τe were each found to be an order of magnitude larger in 11 and 13 than observed for 8, resulting in kr values significantly lower than calculated for 8 (1.3 × 105 s−1).19
Computational modeling
DFT and TDDFT calculations were undertaken in order to ascertain and understand the origins of the electronic structures and transitions of these systems. We have previously demonstrated that employing B3LYP/3-21G* on heavy atoms and B3LYP/SBKJC-DVZ on Ir provides accurate predictions for ground and excited state properties in cationic iridium complexes.30,40b,44,48 In order to best emulate the experimental conditions, a quantum mechanical THF solvation continuum model was incorporated into our computational protocol.42 In order to understand the impact of dimerization, the calculated orbital energies for the 15 highest occupied and of the 15 lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (MOs), together with contour plots for selected relevant MOs for 10–13 are shown in Fig. 5. For the computations, 10-TMS and 12-TMS, which are trimethylsilylethynyl versions of 10 and 12 were used as model systems for 10 and 12, respectively. The TMS groups serve as spectroscopically passive dummy fragment.
 Fig. 5  Calculated energy level scheme for the Kohn–Sham orbitals between HOMO−15 to LUMO+15 of 10-TMS, 11, 12-TMS and 13, including contour plots of selected most relevant MOs and the associated TDDFT calculated HOMO–LUMO energy gap (in eV). Selected MOs have been colored to aide in the analysis. The HOMO and HOMO−1 for 11 and 13 are quasi-degenerate. Green indicates electron density located on both πppy and Ir dπ orbitals, red indicates electron density localized mainly on the π*bpy with minor contribution from the metal. 
The HOMO (H) for each of the four complexes possesses significant contribution from both the πppy orbitals and the Ir dπ orbitals, similar to that observed for other heteroleptic cationic iridium complexes. Homodinuclear 11 and 13 possess pseudo-degenerate H and H−1 orbitals. Generally, the electron density distribution for next 5 highest-energy occupied MOs, are all localized principally on the πppy orbitals with some contribution from the metal. The LUMO (L) for each of the four complexes is essentially exclusively π*bpy in nature, extending out onto the ethynyl unit. For 11 and 13, the orbital picture for the L shows a conjugated system across both bpy units. The L+1 is significantly destabilized for all four complexes. For 10-TMS, the L+1 is destabilized by 0.99 eV and is a mixed π*ppy and Ir dπ* system while for 12-TMS the destabilization is slightly larger at 1.04 eV but the L+1 is better characterized as a mixed π*ppy, π*bpy and Ir dπ* system. The orbital symmetry for the L+1 orbitals for both 11 and 13 is similar to that of their respective LUMOs, whereby the main difference between the L and L+1 is the implication of the other orthogonal π* orbitals of the ethynyl units. The L+1 orbital in each of 11 and 13 is destabilized by 0.56 and 0.44 eV, respectively, compared to the LUMO. To summarize, the computations point to a series of low energy mixed LLCT/MLCT transitions, corroborating the assignments made for the absorption spectra.
Addition of the two fluorines onto the cyclometallating ligand results in a stabilization of the HOMO by 0.31 eV. The magnitude of this stabilization is the same in both the mononuclear (10-TMSvs.12-TMS) and homodinuclear systems (11vs.13). There is also a weak stabilization of the LUMO, indicating that there is some electronic coupling mediated through the metal contribution present in both the HOMO and the LUMO. The magnitude of this stabilization is 0.09 and 0.03 eV for the mono- and homodinuclear systems, respectively. The result of incorporation of fluorine atoms is a net increase of the HOMO–LUMO gap of 0.22 and 0.28 eV, respectively for the mono- (12) and homodinuclear (13) systems, which explains the net observed blue shift in the emission spectra (Fig. 5). The effect of increasing the conjugation along the bpy backbone in the homodinuclear complexes is a stabilization of both the HOMO and the LUMO. The LUMO stabilization calculated is significant at 0.64 and 0.59 eV, respectively, for 11 and 13 compared to 10-TMS and 12-TMS. Here again, the presence of electron density on the Ir in both the HOMO and the LUMO also results also in a stabilization of the former at 0.16 eV for the homodinuclear systems. The HOMO–LUMO gap for the homodinuclear species decreases by between 0.42–0.48 eV, corroborating the behavior observed in the 77 K emission spectra as well as the CV data.
TDDFT calculations of the 100 lowest energy vertical spin-allowed excitation transitions were performed to permit a comparison of the experimental and calculated absorption spectra. Detailed assignments for these transitions are reported in Tables S5–S9† and they are overlayed over the experimentally obtained absorption spectra as vertical bars whose height denotes their respective oscillator strength (Fig. S5–S8†). A summary of the most important low energy transitions is shown in Table 3. For each of the four complexes under investigation, the HOMO → LUMO transition is essentially symmetry forbidden, with oscillator strengths (f) computed to be smaller than 0.0002. The principal low energy features (λ > 350 nm) in the absorption spectrum for 10 are modeled as a mixture of states (S3–S5) of similar intensity (f ca. 0.047) in 10-TMS, exhibiting mainly a mixed MLCT/LLCT character; the S4 state exhibits significant ligand centered (LC) πppy → π*ppy character. Similarly for 12, the spectral region at energies below 350 nm is modeled in 12-TMS as a mixture of states with dominant contributions from H−1 → L (S3), H−4 → L (S5), H → L+1 (S6), all characterizing mixed MLCT/LLCT transitions. Low energy features in 11 and 13 are red-shifted owing to the increased conjugation present in the ancillary ligand. The low energy absorption bands (λ > 450 nm) for 11 are characterized as emanating mainly from a superposition of S3 (H → L+1), S5 (H−4 → L) and S7 (H−2 → L) states while those for 13 are reproduced primarily through contributions from S3 (H−2 → L), S5 (H−4 → L). The nature of each of these transitions is MLCT/LLCT. Those transitions at higher energy and intensity (λ ca. 400 nm for 11 and ca. 390 nm for 13) are characterized as possessing mixed LCbpy and MLCT/LLCT character. Overall, though the computations overestimate the permissibility (f) of the mixed transitions between 390–400 nm in both 11 and 13, the gross features of the experimental absorption spectra are reproduced by the computations.

The mixed MLCT/LLCT transition is also clearly operational during emission from the T1 state for 10–13 as evidenced by the spin density distribution calculations (Fig. 6), which correspond to a superposition of the electron density topologies of the HOMO and LUMO. The spin density maps for 11 and 13 illustrate the increased conjugation across the entire ancillary ligand. Emission energies were calculated using the ΔSCF approach, which is the difference in total energy of the complex between the T1 and S0 states, possessing a geometry optimized at that respective state.40b Emission energy values obtained for 10-TMS, 11, 12-TMS and 13 are, respectively, 574, 650, 522 and 565 nm. The predictions compare favorably to the 77 K emission maxima for mononuclear complexes 10 (λmax = 536 nm) and 12 (λmax = 490 nm) as well as 13 (λmax = 560 nm). For 11, the prediction is red-shifted compared to the experimental λmax (λmax = 556 nm). Notably, the predicted emission energy for the homodinuclear complexes matches quite closely the 298 K λem values (11, λmax = 647 nm; 13, λmax = 560 nm). A potential explanation for the poor emission prediction for 11 is that in rigid media there is significant twisting about the Calkyne–Calkyne bond thus inhibiting conjugation throughout the bipyridyl backbone in 11 and that the computations do not accurately reproduce this conformation. Conversely, at 298 K rotation about the Calkyne–Calkyne bond is rapid and the computed geometry matches more accurately the dynamic conformation present at this temperature for 11, resulting in an accurate predicted emission energy calculation. The computations predict a much more modest red-shift in emission for 13 compared to 12-TMSversus11 compared to 10-TMS.
 Fig. 6  Calculated spin density contours of the T1 state for (a) 10-TMS; (b) 11; (c) 12-TMS; (d) 13 (isocontour value of 0.0004 au). 
The computations corroborate clearly the experimental data that reveal that the two metal centers in 11 and 13 are in electronic communication with each other, explaining the observed red-shift in the 298 K absorption spectra, the emission profile at 77 K and the smaller electrochemical gap in the CV curves compared to mononuclear model systems; however, the photophysical and electrochemical behavior for 13 was much harder to discern given similar emission profiles at 298 K and lack of resolution by CV to detect a second distinct oxidation wave. This study attests to the power of DFT calculations to accurately model the electronic properties of multimetallic species and augers well for the in silico design of new photonic materials.
Conclusion
Herein, we reported the synthesis, photophysical and electrochemical characterization as well as theoretical investigation of two homodinuclear cationic iridium(III) complexes and compared these to mononuclear model systems. The bridging diyne unit mediates an electronic coupling between the two metal subunits and influences the electronic properties of the dimer complexes. Future studies will be directed to finding ligand motifs that maintain the electronic communication between metal centers without unduly impacting quantum efficiencies.
