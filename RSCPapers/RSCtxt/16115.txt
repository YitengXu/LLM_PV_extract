    , Accepted 14th September 2014First published on 7th October 2014AbstractWe report on medium area (1 cm2) slot-die coated organic photovoltaic devices (OPVs) of a recently developed semi-random copolymer of poly-3-hexylthiophene and diketopyrrolopyrrole (P3HTT–DPP-10%) mixed with phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester ([60]PCBM). The devices were prepared using a compact laboratory roll-coater using only slot-die coating and flexographic printing under ambient conditions on a flexible ITO-free substrate. In order to overcome a low JSC and FF obtained for single junction devices, devices were also prepared in a tandem geometry making it possible to employ thinner junction films. Power conversion efficiencies of up to 1.36% and 1.31% were achieved for the tandem and single junction geometries, respectively.
Introduction
The research/development of organic photovoltaic devices (OPVs) is primarily driven forward by their vast potential as a low cost alternative to inorganic solar cells. Until now the majority of research has been focused on increasing the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of OPVs by optimization of the active layer consisting of a donor polymer and an acceptor material.1,2 Optimization has mostly been achieved through development of new polymers, which have either an improved absorption spectrum match with the solar irradiation spectrum, better alignment of the energy level and/or more favorable morphology. This has led to an increase of the best efficiencies from around 3% to 10% for single junction devices over a period of 10 years.3 An improved spectral match has been achieved by synthesis of new lower bandgap polymers utilizing the peak photon flux4,5 or by general broadening of the absorption peak for example by preparation of random copolymers.6–8
For OPVs to fulfill their potential, as a low cost alternative energy source, the manufacturing method should ideally employ roll-2-roll (R2R) solution processing of all layers in an ambient atmosphere and be free of costly and scarce materials such as indium.9–12 Even though this has been known for some time, most research groups still work with small area devices (ca. 0.04 cm2) prepared by spin coating and/or vacuum deposition in an inert atmosphere, all being incompatible with large scale energy production.13,14 Among the conjugated polymers that have been investigated using R2R coating methods, regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) is still the most studied polymer material. Despite its high bandgap, consequently limited absorption, and poor alignment of the energy level with [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester ([60]PCBM), P3HT offers unique properties such as a semicrystalline structure, high hole mobility (enables film thicknesses over 200 nm) and forms a morphology with [60]PCBM, that can withstand high temperatures (used in R2R).15
In an attempt to combine both enhanced absorption and compatibility with R2R, several random copolymers with a base of 3-hexylthiophene copolymerized with acceptor units have been reported recently.7,16,17 Small area devices prepared by spin-coating have obtained higher efficiencies than what is generally reported for devices with P3HT:PCBM, with a peak efficiency of 5.73% reported for P3HTT–DPP-10%. Increases in efficiency relative to P3HT are primarily due to a significantly broadened photoresponse of the semi-random copolymers. Specifically, P3HTT–DPP-10% is a semi-random copolymer consisting of 80% of 3-hexylthiophene copolymerized with 10% thiophene (T) and 10% diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP). The result is a polymer with the combined absorption characteristics of P3HT and DPP-copolymers that exhibits a similar high hole mobility and morphology with fullerenes as P3HT.7
Herein we present our first attempts of preparing OPV devices by slot-die coating of P3HTT–DPP-10%. OPVs were fully prepared on a compact laboratory roll-coating/printing machine by slot-die coating and flexographic printing on a flexible ITO-free substrate known as Flextrode.11 Devices were prepared both in single and homo-tandem junction geometries.
Results
The advantages of Flextrode include low embodied energy, low sheet resistance, and robustness towards bending.10,11,18 The disadvantages of Flextrode is a low optical transmission (60–70%)11 in the near infrared area and silver spikes from the bottom electrode penetrating the PEDOT:PSS and ZnO layer. These silver spikes make it impossible to prepare devices with an active layer thickness lower than 200–250 nm due to shorting as a consequence of direct contact between the top and the bottom electrode. An example of the silver spikes can be seen in Fig. 1A, which is a height profile taken lengthwise on a silver stripe in Flextrode, illustrating multiple peaks with height variations of up to 700 nm. As is also evident from the SEM images (Fig. 1C and D), a cross-sectional image on the width of the stripe shows a silver stripe with a noticeable number of hills and dales, revealing that the roughness is not only an issue at the length of the stripe. The tilted images in Fig. 1D show a ridge along the length of the silver stripe, with local dewetting spots of subsequent deposited layers along the ridge. This large thickness requirement can have a great influence on the type of polymer which is suitable for roll-coating on Flextrode. Among the seemingly less suitable polymers, DPP copolymers have been found to exhibit a significant decrease in FF with increasing film thickness.19 To overcome the thickness challenge, devices with the polymer P3HTT-DPP-10% were prepared both in a single and tandem junction geometry allowing the thickness of the individual active layers to be below 200 nm. The layer structures used in this work can be seen in Fig. 1B, a single junction stack consisting of 8 layers and a tandem stack with 12 layers all solution processed sequentially on top of each other as we presented previously.18

We prepared OPVs with an active-material of P3HTT–DPP-10% and PCBM with a ratio of 1:1.3 in chlorobenzene both for single and tandem junctions. Devices were prepared with varying active layer thicknesses to find the optimal thickness combination. For the single junction devices it is evident from Fig. 2 that the better performance is found with the thinner active layer due to an increase in FF and Voc. The PCE obtained for tandem devices increases when the front cell is increased in thickness from 76 to 109 nm. An additional thickness of the front cell resulted in a decrease in efficiency due to a loss of current. The optimized homo-tandem devices revealed a slightly better performance than the optimized single junction devices due to a comparable FF and an increase in VOC of 66%, which is however lower than the theoretical value. As previously shown the high VOC cannot be expected when utilizing a flexible substrate,18,20 and this is combined with a decrease of 35% in JSC. The decrease in JSC is, according to theory regarding tandem OPVs, expected to be larger since the JSC in the tandem architecture is dictated by the sub-cell with the lowest JSC, and this reveals that the single junction devices could have problems with either exciton dissociation or carrier extraction.

The achieved PCE of 1.31 and 1.36% for single and tandem junctions is significantly lower than the efficiencies obtained on small area devices prepared by spin-coating, mostly due to a large decrease in JSC and FF. These can be explained by an undesirable morphology (as seen in Fig. ESI 1 in ESI†) and the changes as a result of upscaling the device size as seen previously. It is however notable that the homo-tandem device performs slightly better than the single junction device when employing nearly the same active material (273 nm for the single junction and a total of 277 nm for the tandem), in spite of the fact that there are significant losses in VOC.

Fig. 3 shows photographs and laser beam induced current (LBIC) images of the best performing devices of both tandem and single junction geometries. It can be seen that the active area is slightly reduced for the tandem device giving it an area just below 1 cm2. This reduction originates from the two offsets between active layers and the intermediate layer. The tandem device also reveals a slight colour difference compared to the single junction device with a similar total active layer thickness due to the PEDOT:PSS used in the intermediate layer the transmission have decreased. The added number of layers not only decreases the transmission but also increases the chance of coating defects as can be seen on the LBIC images shown in Fig. 3. Where the tandem device shows two clear coating defects (blue areas in the bottom center and on the bottom right) whereas the single junction device only shows minor defects. Photographs of all device types can be found in Fig. ESI 2 in the ESI.†

Conclusion
In conclusion, the semi-random copolymer P3HTT–DPP-10% mixed with [60]PCBM was tested in organic solar cells (OPVs) both in a single and tandem junction geometry. Flexible ITO-free OPVs were prepared in an inverted geometry by slot-die coating and flexographic printing on a small laboratory roll-coater. Both device geometries were optimized with regard to thickness for single junction devices and the efficiency increased with decreasing film thickness, whereas the tandem devices had a peak performance with sub-cell thicknesses of 178 nm.
The homo-tandem geometry with a PCE of 1.36% demonstrates an increase in power conversion efficiency of approximately 4% when compared to single junction devices with the observed coating defects so potentially an even larger improvement can be achieved. This increase can mainly be ascribed to a smaller than expected decrease in JSC. Importantly this is the first report of the use of semi-random copolymers in medium area, flexible, and roll-coated solar cells. The data reported here are further evidence of the practical relevance of this class of polymer and ongoing work is focused on continued optimization of processing conditions.
Experimental
Materials and methods
The synthesis procedure for the random copolymer poly(3-hexylthiophene-thiophene–diketopyrrolopyrrole) containing 10% diketopyrrolopyrrole was previously published.7 Chlorobenzene and 2-propanol (IPA) (99.8%) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich and used without further purification, Clevios P VP Al4083 and Clevios F010 were acquired from Heraeus mixed with 2-propanol. PV 5025 silver was purchased from Dupont. ZnO nanoparticles were prepared according to the literature21 and dispersed in acetone with a concentration of 56 mg mL−1.
Ink preparation
P3HTT–DPP-10% mixed with PCBM in a 1:1.3 ratio were used in two concentrations, 23 mg mL−1 for coating of films thicker than 100 nm and 16.1 mg mL−1 for films thinner than 100 nm. Clevios F010 was used in two formulation both diluted with IPA, a compatibilizer formulation PEDOT:PSS F010:IPA 1:4 vol/vol and conductive electrode 2:1 vol/vol. Hole transporting layer in the intermediate layer and back electrode a formulation of Al4083 with IPA in 1:2 vol/vol was used.
Device preparation
The device with an area of approximately 1 cm2 was prepared on a laboratory scale roll-coater using slot-die coating as the primary method for ink deposition on a large scale R2R produced ITO-free substrate known as Flextrode. Coating of the active layer was conducted at 1.3 m min−1 from the inks described above, and the thickness of the applied layers was controlled by the wet thickness of the inks by primarily changing the pump-rate. The intermediate layer consisted of three layers coated individually: (1) a compatibilizing PEDOT:PSS F010 layer was coated with a wet thickness of 8 µm, (2) PEDOT:PSS 4083 hole selective layer at 23 µm wet layer thickness, and (3) zinc oxide had a wet thickness of 5 µm. The top PEDOT:PSS electrode was composed of three layers of PEDOT:PSS: (1) a compatibilizing PEDOT:PSS F010 layer was coated with a wet thickness of 8 µm, (2) PEDOT:PSS 4083 hole selective layer at 23 µm wet layer thickness, and (3) PEDOT:PSS F010 was coated with a wet thickness of 38 µm. Top silver was flexographically printed with a web-speed of 1.3 m min−1.
Device characterization
The freshly prepared devices were encapsulated between two pieces of glass with UV-curable adhesives (DELO-LP655) after which the I–V characteristics were measured with a Keithley 2400 source meter under 100 mW cm−2 white light from a Steuernagel solar simulator.
