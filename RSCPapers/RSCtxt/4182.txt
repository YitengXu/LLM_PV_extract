1 Introduction
Graphene, a two-dimensional (2D) lattice of sp2-hybridized carbon, presents many unique properties and has attracted intensive research interest since its discovery in 2004.1–8 Because of the linear energy dispersion relation of charge carriers, graphene is proven to be a specific type of zero band gap semiconductor with an infinite exciton Bohr radius.9 However, the zero band gap of graphene strongly limits its applications in optoelectronics and photonics.10 Surface modification, doping, as well as reducing the lateral dimensions of graphene into nanoribbon and/or quantum dots (QDs), are considered the main effective approaches to contribute to its band gap engineering.11–15 In addition to the remarkably enhanced quantum confinement effect (QCE), the edge effect will be prominent when graphene is converted to graphene quantum dots (GQDs), whose lateral dimensions are less than 100 nm.16 These two outstanding effects endow GQDs with new physical properties with widespread applications, and herein they have become the research focus in recent years.17
Photoluminescence (PL) of GQDs is one of the most outstanding features extended from graphene, which can be easily tailored by controlling their size and shape, doping nonmetallic ions, and modifying their surfaces and edges.18 In addition to the tunable PL, GQDs exhibit large surface area, ease of surface modification, high photostability, low cytotoxicity, and excellent biocompatibility.19 As a consequence of their special structures and unique properties, photoluminescent GQDs are expected to be more viable than the conventional semiconductor QDs and other carbon-based luminescent nanomaterials.
The prerequisite for the investigation of photoluminescent GQDs is the controllable synthesis of high quality GQDs. To date, a variety of synthetic methods have been developed,20 which can be classified into two categories: one is to directly cut graphene- or graphite-related materials (graphene,21 graphene oxide,22 carbon nanotube,23 carbon fiber,24 carbon black,25 nanosized graphite,19 graphite powder,26 coal,27etc.) into quantum size through a series of physical, chemical, and electrochemical processes, which is commonly referred to as the “top-down” method. The other strategy lies in chemical synthesis, typically called the “bottom-up” method, in which molecular precursors (such as hexa-peri-hexabenzocoronene,28 4-bromobenzene carboxylic acid,29 3-iodo-4-bromoaniline,30,31 citric acid,32 glucose,33 benzene,34etc.) were controllably converted to GQDs by stepwise chemical reactions. Such rich synthetic methods allow us to investigate the PL features of GQDs with a desired size and structure. Herein, abundant meaningful achievements, associated with the PL mechanisms and expanded applications, have been made during recent years.
In this article, we provide an overview of photoluminescent GQDs, focusing on their PL features, underlying mechanisms, and promising applications. Since there are a large number of publications on the subject of photoluminescent GQDs,17,18,35 we emphasize clear elucidation of the PL mechanisms that could be applied to explain both normal and abnormal PL properties of GQDs, as well as cover the latest applications in the fields of energy, biomedicine, and environment. The latest researches on the UC in GQDs by the use of a femtosecond laser are also summarized. We hope this article could provide a concise overview of photoluminescent GQDs and stimulate new ideas for further research.
2 General description of PL of GQDs
Photoluminescence refers to the phenomenon of light emission after the excitation of photons. The PL spectrum of GQDs usually presents a broad emission band, covering from UV to visible light regions. The corresponding photoluminescence excitation (PLE) spectra are composed of two or more peaks, corresponding to the excitations of size/edge-related intrinsic states in higher energy and vacancy/functional groups associated defect states in lower energy.19 For instance, Fig. 1a shows the representative PL and PLE spectra of the hydrothermally synthesized GQDs. It is worth noting that GQDs could exhibit bright emission with tunable color by simply adjusting the experimental conditions (Fig. 1b).36

3 Versatile PL features
3.1 Internal factor-dependent PL
The intrinsic structures of GQDs, including size/edge,22,37,38 functional groups,39,40 and chemical doping,41–45 can be easily varied by using different synthesis methods and subsequent treatments, leading to the tailoring of the electronic structure of GQDs. As a result, versatile PL properties can be achieved. Generally, the band gap of GQDs has been demonstrated to increase as the size decreases, leading to a blue shift of their PL emission (Fig. 2a).24,33 However, Kim et al. obtained an anomalous PL evolution of GQDs with various sizes.22 As shown in Fig. 2b, the PL peak energy exhibited a red-shift first and then a blue-shift with an increasing lateral dimension of GQDs. This unusual PL behavior could be attributed to the corresponding edge structure variations of GQDs with different sizes, in addition to the QCE. The above size-dependent PL features were based on GQDs without surface passivation. However, GQDs will not exhibit such behavior if there is a self-passivated layer on the surface, such as the GQDs prepared by glucose carbonization.46

Functionalization of GQDs is another common factor to shift PL emission. Jin et al.47 observed that the amine functionalized GQDs exhibited a red shift of PL emission (ca. 28 nm) compared to the un-functionalized GQDs, as depicted in Fig. 2c. They ascribed it to the charge transfer from amine functional groups to GQDs, which could increase the electron density on the carbon framework, subsequently lowering the band gap. Zhu et al.39 compared the PL spectra of graphene oxide quantum dots (GOQDs), reduced GQDs, and alkylamine functionalized GQDs. By reducing and replacing the carboxyl and epoxy groups in GOQDs, PL intensities were greatly enhanced because carboxyl and epoxy groups could induce non-radiative recombination. Moreover, PL color was changed from green to blue during the above processes. Since carboxyl and epoxy groups act as the non-radiative luminescent centers, the removal of these oxygen-containing groups, either by reduction or by surface passivation, is beneficial to achieve a higher quantum yield.18,36
Doping foreign atoms is another effective method to adjust the PL of GQDs. Li et al.41 observed that the PL peak of GQDs was shifted to higher energy when N atoms were introduced into the structure. This phenomenon could be attributed to the relatively strong electron affinity of N atoms, inducing the modulation of the chemical and electronic characteristics of GQDs. Tang et al.42 found a clear red shift (∼10 nm) when fluorine was doped in GQDs, which may be attributed to the trapping of excitons in shallow trap states associated with charge separation between the carbon backbone and highly electronegative F atoms.
3.2 External factor-dependent PL
In addition to the internal parameters, PL of GQDs is readily affected by the external experimental conditions. Like most luminescent carbon nanoparticles,48,49 GQDs can exhibit an excitation-dependent PL behavior.21,28,50 In general, the PL peak of GQDs will shift to longer wavelengths with an increasing excitation wavelength (Fig. 2d). At the same time, the PL intensity will vary rapidly, with the most intense peak excited at the absorption band. Another remarkable feature of GQDs is the pH-dependent PL, and the pH-dependence varies according to their sizes and structures. For example, Pan et al. observed that GQDs emitted strong PL under basic conditions while got completely quenched under acidic conditions.21 The PL intensity was reversible if the pH value was switched repeatedly between 1 and 13 (Fig. 2e). Jeon and coworkers47 observed that their GQDs showed enhanced PL without a peak shift when the pH value was tuned from 7 to 1, while the PL intensity greatly decreased with an emission peak red-shift when the pH value was changed from 7 to 10. They continued to functionalize the GQDs with amine and obtained a different pH-dependent result (Fig. 2f). In addition to the excitation- and pH-dependent features, PL of GQDs also depends on the types of solvents.39
The surrounding micro-environment of GQDs also shows a great influence on their PL properties. When GQDs were encapsulated into zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF) nanocrystals, their PL spectra could be red shifted by ca. 32 nm, attributing to the interaction between the carboxylic acids in GQDs and the Zn ions in ZIF.51 Furthermore, Wang and coworkers52 theoretically speculated that the PL color of GQDs could also be precisely adjusted from blue to green by designing a single silver nano-octahedron (SNO) in the vicinity of GQDs. The SNO was predicted to act as a multifrequency plasmonic antenna with multiple plasmon resonance modes, covering multiple emission peaks of GQDs. Although this novel modulating strategy could facilitate the potential applications of GQDs, great efforts are still required to achieve it in experiments.
Detailed mechanisms of the above factor-dependent PL of GQDs will be discussed in the next section.
3.3 Upconversion
In some recent researches,42,53 GQDs were reported to exhibit upconversion photoluminescence (UCPL). This was significant for GQDs to be practically applied in biomedical imaging/labeling, as the low energy excitation photons possess a high penetration depth, low destruction to tissues or organisms, and reduced autofluorescence.54 However, it should be pointed out that the “UCPL” of GQDs by monochromatic light from a xenon lamp should be normal PL (NPL).55,56 Gan et al. presented a systematic study to explain the origin of the blue emission in GQDs by the excitation of monochromatic light. Based on the comparisons of PL (Fig. 3a), PLE spectra (Fig. 3b), and decay lifetimes (Fig. 3c) between “upconversion” luminescence (excited by λ) and normal luminescence (excited by λ/2), they confirmed that the previously claimed “UCPL” in GQDs excited by monochromatic light actually originated from the co-existence of second-order diffraction light of wavelength λ/2 with the excitation wavelength λ. Such “UCPL” would vanish if a cut filter was applied as shown in Fig. 3d. Likely, under the excitation of a xenon lamp, nitrogen doped GQDs (N-GQDs) did not exhibit “UCPL” either. Besides the above evidence, Wen et al.57 measured the excitation intensity dependence of fluorescence of GQDs and found the slope value to be approximately 1, further verifying whether the “UCPL” in GQDs by the excitation of monochromatic light should be NPL.

It is interesting and imperative to explore whether there is real UCPL in GQDs when using a high power density laser. Gan et al.56 experimentally observed the UCPL under excitation of a femtosecond 800 nm pulsed laser as presented in Fig. 3e and f. The UCPL can be further shifted to green emission, when the GQDs were oxidized58 or doped with nitrogen atoms.59 The appearance of UCPL under a femtosecond laser should be attributed to the abundant energy levels in GQDs, which can be directly reflected from the excitation wavelength-dependent PL features.56 In the recent reports,58,59 the main UC mechanism of GQDs should be the excited-state absorption. More efficient UC approaches need to be further explored, like the energy transfer upconversion, cooperative sensitization upconversion, and photon avalanche in lanthanide-doped materials.60
4 PL mechanisms
Currently, various mechanisms have been proposed to explain the PL phenomena of GQDs with different sizes, shapes, edges, and surface structures. At first, the PL of GQDs was simply suggested to originate from free zigzag sites with a carbene-like triplet ground state.21 Subsequently, a more complete PL mechanism, involving intrinsic and defect emissions, was proposed.19,39,61,62 The exhibited PL emission depends on the competition of these emission centers. A clear evidence to support this mechanism was reported by Liu et al.19 They found that the pristine GQDs exhibited a blue PL emission band. However, for GOQDs under the same excitation wavelength, the PL emission band was shifted to green with intensity greatly decreased. The PLE (Fig. 4a and b) and decay lifetime curves (Fig. 4c and d) suggested that GQDs possessed both intrinsic and defect states while the intrinsic state in GOQDs almost disappeared. Therefore, the reduction of intrinsic state emission and increase of defect state emission should be responsible for the PL evolution of GOQDs. This mechanism could well explain most of the PL features of GQDs. As the intrinsic emission of GQDs is generated by the QCE and edge effect, the variation of size and the edge structure will change the above two effects, leading to different PL features, which is called size/edge-dependent PL. The QCE will arouse the discrete feature of the intrinsic excitation band.62 With the increase of excitation wavelength, the gradual evolution from the discrete intrinsic excitation band to the defect state band causes the excitation wavelength-dependent PL. In addition, the size distribution in GQDs should also be one of the possible reasons for the excitation-dependent PL. In this case, GQDs with a smaller size will be excited by shorter wavelength, while GQDs with a larger size will be excited by longer wavelength. Therefore, along with the increase of excitation wavelength, a red-shift will be observed according to the QCE. Since both the size of sp2 carbon clusters and the defect state density in GQDs may be altered by surface/edge functionalization, either the defect state emission or the intrinsic state emission may dominate, causing the widely reported functionalization-dependent PL. In some specific functionalization forms (amine, etc.), the surface/edge modification of GQDs can also tune the band gap through the charge transfer between the functional groups and GQDs47 or forming an interband state,63 resulting in the shift of PL emission.

As described in Section 3.2, both the PL intensity and peak energy of GQDs show strong dependence on surrounding pH values. This phenomenon could be generally attributed to the protonation and de-protonation of the edge sites and functional groups.21,47 On one hand, the free zigzag sites will be protonated under acidic conditions, which destroys the emissive carbene-like triplet state and decreases its intrinsic PL intensity. However, the zigzag sites can be restored under basic environment, thereby leading to the restoration of emission intensity. On the other hand, the functional groups grafted onto the surface or edge will also protonate and deprotonate under acidic and basic conditions, respectively. These processes play a key role in suppressing or prompting the charge transfer from GQDs to the functional groups, thus resulting in a PL peak red or blue shift. Therefore, by combining these two mechanisms, versatile pH dependent PL features can be realized in various GQDs.
Very recently, Yang and coworkers64–66 employed a combination of techniques, including femtosecond broadband transient absorption spectroscopy, femtosecond time-resolved fluorescence dynamics, as well as nanosecond time-correlated single-photon counting technique, to give more detailed information on the PL processes of GQDs. Their experimental results revealed that the molecule-like states, composed of the functional groups (such as carboxyl and carbonyl groups) and carbon atoms on the edge of GQDs, were mainly responsible for the green PL emission of GQDs. The related PL mechanisms involved both regular absorption and excited-state absorption processes. This is an important supplement to the existing mechanism, binding the functional groups and carbon atoms as a whole emissive center. The synergistic effect of the intrinsic state and molecule-like emission could endow GQDs with an enhanced resistance to photobleaching.
5 Applications
5.1 Energy-related applications
Recent reports suggest that the GQDs are promising for applications in light emitting diodes (LEDs) as the luminescent component.38,67 This is because the broad PLE band of GQDs matches well with the LED chips. Lau and co-workers coated a layer of GQDs onto the surface of a commercial blue LED chip.46,68 After applying voltage, the chip exhibited intense blue emission centered at ∼410 nm, which further excited GQDs to show the characteristic broad emission peaked at ∼510 nm. As a result, the whole LED emitted white light as illustrated in Fig. 5.46 Furthermore, they employed GQDs@agar composites to replace raw GQDs for the fabrication of LEDs.68 The luminous efficiency of the GQDs@agar composite coated LED reached 42.2 lm W−1 under 20 mA, which was almost constant during continuous operation for over 100 hours. These kinds of LEDs using GQDs and GQD composites were suggested to have higher luminous efficiency and better light conversion stability than those of the conventional semiconductor QDs based LEDs.

GQDs also showed great promise in photovoltaic devices, with respect to their size-tuned optical response, high specific surface area, efficient multiple carrier generation, and tunable band gaps.17,69 Gao et al.70 developed a new type of solar cells based on the crystalline silicon/GQDs heterojunction. Compared to the devices without GQDs, crystalline silicon/GQDs heterojunction solar cells showed a significantly enhanced photovoltaic performance, with an optimum power conversion efficiency of 6.63%. Zhu et al.71 reported a remarkable power conversion efficiency enhancement of perovskite solar cells by inserting an ultrathin GQDs layer. Such an improvement was owing to the faster electron extraction in the presence of GQDs. Therefore, GQDs were suggested to act as a superfast electron tunnel for optoelectronic devices.
Like other N-doped carbon nanomaterials, N-GQDs could exhibit electrocatalytic activity for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Qu and coworkers41 reported that the ORR onset potential of graphene supported N-GQDs (N-GQDs/graphene) was close to that of the commercial Pt/C catalyst. Moreover, the N-GQDs/graphene electrode showed a stable ORR, indicating their remarkable tolerance to possible crossover effects. Another work by Li et al.72 suggested that nitrogen doping played an important role in the electrocatalytic activity of N-GQDs, even at a level as low as ∼1%. Their results did not show a direct correlation between the catalytic performance and the amount of nitrogen doping. Instead, size-dependent electrocatalytic activity for ORR was observed, ascribing to the higher HOMO (highest occupied molecular orbital) levels in larger N-GQDs leading to easier oxidation. This feature is significant for understanding and further improving the electrocatalytic activity of N-GQDs.
5.2 Biomedical applications for human health
Because of their tunable PL, excellent photostability, low cytotoxicity, high biocompatibility, as well as ease of functionalization, GQDs are attractive for applications in the biomedical field as an imaging and labeling luminescent agent to track molecular targets in live cells or organs.25,26,73,74 This allows us to obtain direct evidences for the understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms and bio-dynamic processes. Here, we take the imaging of stem cells as an example, as stem cells are essential to understand native development and tissue regeneration. The research by Zhang et al.75 suggested that GQDs could easily penetrate into the stem cells with little cytotoxicity and helped generate clear and stable images (Fig. 6a and b). They also carried out the control experiments by using CdS QDs and C60 nanoparticles. However, the stem cells died on incubation with CdS QDs owing to the cytotoxicity of Cd2+, while no C60 fluorescence was detected inside the stem cells, indicating that GQDs were a much better bio-imaging and labeling agent.

(e) The mouse treated with GQDs-Band-Aid. Reproduced by permission of American Chemical Society.79 
GQDs can also be employed to detect biological tissues. For example, Zhao et al.76 adopted graphene as an acceptor and mouse anti-human immunoglobulin G (mIgG)-conjugated GQDs (mIgG-GQDs) as a donor to fabricate the immunosensor for detecting human mIgG. The detection mechanism was based on the PL recovery degree of mIgG-GQDs that were first quenched by graphene due to the π–π stacking interaction. Similarly, Qian et al.77 managed to analyze a low concentration of DNA based on the fluorescence resonance energy transfer between biocompatible GQDs and carbon nanotubes.
Most recent results further supported the development of GQDs as antibacterial agents.78 The work by Qu and coworkers demonstrated that GQDs possessed peroxidase-like activity, allowing the conversion of H2O2 into ˙OH.79 Due to the fact that ˙OH exhibits a higher antibacterial performance than that of H2O2, a more efficient antibacterial system in vitro could be realized by combining GQDs with a low dose of H2O2. This made it possible to avoid the toxicity of H2O2 at high concentrations. Moreover, GQDs-Band-Aids were prepared, which exhibited an excellent antibacterial feature in vivo when combined with a low concentration of H2O2 (Fig. 6c–e), indicating that GQDs-Band-Aids have promising applications for wound disinfection.
5.3 Sensors for environmental detection
The PL of GQDs can be effectively quenched by selectively doping specific cations, anions, or chemical groups.80–84 This feature allows GQDs to be used as sensors for quantitative and qualitative detection. The detection method on the basis of PL quenching is the so-called “turn off” model. It should be noted that GQDs with different intrinsic structures have different selective quenching phenomena, allowing GQDs to detect various ions/chemical groups. For example, the N-containing GQDs synthesized by electrochemical cutting of the graphene 3D framework could be employed to detect Fe3+ (as illustrated in Fig. 7),85 while the photoluminescent GQDs prepared by pyrolyzing citric acid and the amino-functionalized GQDs by hydrothermal reaction could be used to detect Cl− and Cu2+, respectively.32,86 Generally, the “turn off” luminescent model presents a relatively high background compared with the “turn on” method.87 Therefore, a novel “off-to-on” model, through recovery of the quenched PL, was designed to fabricate GQDs based sensors. By the use of this model, Bai et al.88 and Liu et al.89 demonstrated that GQDs@Eu3+ and glutathione-functionalized GQDs@Fe3+ were efficient photoluminescent probes for phosphate sensing. Such GQDs based sensors for detecting metal cations, nonmetal anions, and chemical groups in solution with a high sensitivity are undoubtedly beneficial to environment protection.

6 Conclusions and outlook
In this article, we have summarized recent progress of photoluminescent GQDs, including the versatile PL features, key mechanisms, and promising applications. The PL behaviors of GQDs could be readily tuned. In general, the tunable PL could be ascribed to the competition between the intrinsic state and the defect state emissions. Some other important PL mechanisms, such as the charge transfer and molecule-like states, were also discussed. Although many significant achievements have been made, many challenges are yet to be addressed. For example, the quantum yield of GQDs, which varies with the fabrication method and the involved surface chemistry, needs to be further improved. This requires researchers to further explore the in-depth PL mechanisms, including a thorough understanding of the formation of defect states, and the luminescence efficiencies for both intrinsic states and defect states. As shown in Fig. 1b, GQDs can be controlled to exhibit intense emissions from blue to yellow. Red and near infrared emissions can be obtained by further increasing the excitation wavelength, but their intensity is low. Therefore, it is necessary to exploit bright longer wavelength luminescence to expand the applications of GQDs. In addition, the methodology to design GQDs-based materials for environment detection should be further advanced, to ideally eliminate the side effects originated from the external ions/chemical groups at low concentrations. It is worth noting that most of the optical studies of GQDs reported so far were performed macroscopically, in which some intriguing fluorescent phenomena were hidden. The ultimate goal is to investigate photoluminescent GQDs on a single-particle level, which is expected to eventually clarify the mechanism. We wish this article would stimulate continued interest and endeavors in the area of photoluminescent GQDs.
