        CuGaS2
nanorods were synthesized by irradiating the precursor solution with intense X-rays. The products are single crystal nanorods with preferential [220] growth and a uniform size distribution. We also report on the photoresponse of drop-cast films of these nanorods.
I–III–VI2 semiconductors are extensively studied in view of applications, for example, as photovoltaic devices.1,2 Cu(In1–xGax)Se2 (CIGS) thin film solar cells demonstrated nearly 20% solar power conversion efficiency,3 higher than CdTe or amorphous-Si based devices.4 However, the commercial use of CIGS devices still requires techniques to fabricate large-area films.5CuGaS2, another I–III–VI2chalcopyrite compound, is also extensively investigated because of its conductivity, normally p-type, and large gap (∼2.4 eV). This is comparable to large-gap II–VI semiconductors like ZnS, or ZnSe, which for device quality can only be obtained as n-type.6–12

Nanocrystal-based solar cells attracted much attention due to the potential exploitation of quantum-confinement effects.13–15 In fact, by changing the particle size the absorption wavelength can be tuned from the visible to the near infrared.16,17 The studies in this direction were recently extended to the self-assembling of nanocrystals.18,19
In this study, we fabricated single-crystal nanorods of CuGaS2. The results are interesting by themselves and as a lead to the similar fabrication of Cu(In1−xGax)S2 nanocrystals, which we preliminarily tested. Our method, based on the very intense X-ray irradiation,20–23 offers several advantages with respect to current approaches such as hot-injection,24–26 including high yield and excellent nanorod characteristics.
The method was inspired by other recent studies on nanofabrication triggered by irradiation or ultrasound exposure.27–35 The most significant advantage of this class of techniques is the absence of reducing agents, whose effects are automatically produced by the photons or by the ultrasound. Such approaches include gamma-ray irradiation,29 visible laser irradiation,30,31 sonochemical synthesis32 and microwave heating.33 One problem, however, is the typically low yield: for example, at least 30 hours were required for X-ray irradiation with conventional sources34 and 5 hours for gamma-ray irradiation35 to produce significant amounts of gold nanocrystals.
This problem does not exist in our case, thanks to the use of very intense X-rays from a synchrotron source requiring only several minutes. The CuGaS2 single crystal nanorods so synthesized disperse well in toluene and can be cast as uniform, crack-free thin films on glass substrates.
Experimentally, the nanorods synthesized by irradiating the precursor solution with intense X-rays are described in detail in the ESI.†
The morphology and crystallographic characteristics of the CuGaS2 samples were examined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Fig. 1(a) and (b) are TEM images with different magnification showing CuGaS2 nanorods assembled as a locally well-ordered close-packed array. Between areas packed with nanorods, some round shape nanoparticles are present which are likely the result of the incomplete reaction. The single-crystal nature of the nanorods is demonstrated by their selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns, as shown in the inset of Fig. 1(a).
 Fig. 1  (a) and (b) TEM images of CuGaS2 nanorods with different magnifications; (c) HRTEM images of a CuGaS2 nanorod and its FFT (inset); (d) XRD of CuGaS2 nanorods. The peaks correspond to the chalcopyrite crystallographic directions of CuGaS2 (JCPDS No. 85-1574). 
The CuGaS2 nanorods have a rather uniform size and shape, with a mean width of 2.8 ± 0.3 nm and a length of 20.8 ± 5.7 nm (see ESI†, Fig. S1). To the best of our knowledge, CuGaS2 nanorods with such a narrow size distribution are difficult or impossible to produce by solution or other synthesis methods.
The composition analysis by energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), as shown in Fig. S2 of ESI†, of nanorod-covered areas gives an average Cu/Ga/S composition of 0.9/1.1/2.0, close to the target 1/1/2 ratio. High resolution TEM images, for example Fig. 1(c), reveal that the nanorods have single crystal character with a clear interplanar spacing of 0.19 nm. This structure corresponds to the lattice spacing of the (220) planes and is perpendicular to the growth direction of the nanocrystals.
Neither twinning nor dislocations were detected in the characterized samples. We thus conclude that highly crystalline nanoalloys with specific shape and size are produced by our approach instead of core–shell structures. The inset of Fig. 1(c) shows the fast Fourier-transform (FFT) of a high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image. The FFT confirms the tetragonal chalcopyrite structure of our CuGaS2.

Fig. 1(d) shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of CuGaS2 nanorods, which can be used to identify the growth direction. These patterns correspond to a I(112)/I(220) XRD intensity ratio of ∼1.1, to be compared to 3.0 for bulk CuGaS2. The size estimated using Sherrer equation—4.2 nm (112) and 15.7 nm (220)—indicates that there is a [220] nanorod crystal texture within the chalcopyrite structure. This conclusion was verified by the analysis shown in Fig. 1(c). The results are similar to other reports36–38 on a chalcopyrite system structure: consistent with the fact that the {220} surface has the highest surface energy, the nanorods tend to grow along the [220] direction.

EDS was performed in the scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) mode to determine the local composition of the CuGaS2 nanorods, as shown in Fig. 2. STEM-EDS mapping confirmed that the nanorods are uniformly alloyed. At the border of the mapped area, some nanorods are not clearly identified. This is likely due to the lower signals of Cu and Ga which make the ends of these nanorods more affected by the image drift than the rest of their images.

The valence states of the resulting nanorods were investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), as shown in Fig. 3(a). The Cu 2p, Ga 2p, and S 2p core levels were examined. The observed binding energy of Cu 2p is in good agreement with the reported values for CuInS2 nanocrystals,39 indicating that the Cu valence state in the CuGaS2 nanorods is +1 (Fig. 3(b)). The broadened Ga 2p spectrum (Fig. 3(c)) is due to the surface gallium ions of the nanorods bonded with oleylamine, resulting in Ga–O bonds with slightly higher binding energy than for the Ga–S bonds.40 The two peaks of S 2p at 161.0 and 162.5 eV in Fig. 3(d) are assigned to S of a valence of −2.

The interest of our synthesis method is related to a good extent to possible photovoltaic applications. For a feasibility test, we studied the optoelectronic properties of the products. Absorption spectra of CuGaS2 nanorods in toluene are presented in Fig. 4(a) and (b). The absorption peak at 2.45 eV (505 nm) is consistent with the bulk gap, 2.46 eV.

We then fabricated ∼500 nm thick films by drop-casting concentrated toluene solutions of CuGaS2 nanorods on interdigitated electrode glass test chips.41 The current–voltage curves (e.g., Fig. 4(c)) show that the nanorods are indeed photoresponsive.
We applied the same method to study Cu(In1−xGax)S2 nanocrystals, which show a better photoresponsive behavior than CuGaS2 (Fig. 4(d)). The current of Cu(In1−xGax)S2 films at 5 V increased indeed from 9.2 × 10−6 mA in the dark to 1.4 × 10−5 mA under illumination.
Finally, we would like to comment on some morphological features of our nanorods. Specifically, their shape is quite well rounded and even more so after the X-ray irradiation time is increased. A TEM image after prolonged irradiation is shown in Fig. S3 of ESI.† The corresponding XRD patterns show that the XRD intensity ratio I(112)/I(220) is ∼2.0 for 4 min irradiation and becomes 2.9 at 6 minutes irradiation, close to the bulk value of 3.0 (Fig. S4 of ESI†). We interpret this as a heating effect. Indeed, heating of the precursor solution not only promotes crystal growth but has also a strong effect on the degree of faceting of the nanocrystals.42 Indeed, the particles produced by a hot-injection process are faceted but become more rounded after heating at elevated temperature.43
These findings also suggest that nanorods are intermediate products in this synthesis process. The heat generated by the prolonged X-ray irradiation is a significant factor in the growth which influences the nanorod morphology adding another control mechanism to the process. In our case, when the X-ray irradiation is increased from 4 to 6 min, some rounded CuGaS2 nanoparticles appear in the solution instead of just nanorods. A TEM image after prolonged irradiation is shown in Fig. S3 of ESI.† The corresponding XRD patterns show that the XRD intensity ratio I(112)/I(220) is ∼2.0 for 4 minutes irradiation and becomes 2.9 at 6 minutes irradiation, close to the bulk value of 3.0 (Fig. S4 of ESI†). All these facts suggest that heating by the irradiating X-rays is a significant factor in the growth and influences the nanorod morphology, potentially adding another control mechanism to the process.
In summary, a well-controlled size and shape (∼3 nm in diameter and ∼21 nm in length) was obtained for CuGaS2 nanorods. Results from XRD and TEM show that these nanorods are single crystals with a preferred growth direction [220]. The electrical behavior investigated on drop-cast films of CuGaS2 nanorods on interdigitated electrode glass exhibited a clear photoresponse. The photoresponse was even stronger for Cu(In1−xGax)S2 nanocrystal films. The X-ray irradiation time significantly influences the morphology of CuGaS2 nanorods and this could be interpreted as a heating effect. These results could open the way to an alternative low-cost and high-yield fabrication of Cu(In1−xGax)S2 thin-film solar cells. The ongoing optimization in view of applications focuses on the growth and characterization of Cu(In1−xGax)S2 films and on tuning the In/Ga concentration ratio.
