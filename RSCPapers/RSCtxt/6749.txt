    , Accepted 19th September 2017First published on 20th September 2017AbstractA series of A–D–π–D–A double-anchoring organic dyes (MA-201–MA-206) with different core spacers were designed to investigate the optoelectronic property and to develop their utility in solar cell. The short-circuit current density (JSC) and open-circuit voltage (VOC) can be directly estimated from simulated micro-parameters, and the influence of nature of core spacers on the efficiency was compared and investigated. The results reveal that dyes MA-201–MA-206 have narrower energy gap and higher molar extinction coefficient compared with the referenced dye (MA-2), and designed molecules (MA-201–MA-206) also exhibit the higher light-harvesting efficiency, electron accepting power and lower driving force of electron injection, chemical hardness as well as reorganization energy. Among the designed dyes, electron injection time on femtosecond (fs) scale for MA-201, MA-203 and MA-206 is smaller than that of MA-2, meaning that electron injection from excited state into TiO2 should take place easily. Those parameters suggested that the designed molecules should have the higher JSC, and dyes MA-201–MA-206 have higher dipole moment unormal, which will increase the VOC. Furthermore, one anchoring model and two anchoring models were compared from the energy level and spectra and driving force. It is expected that the dyes (MA-201–MA-206) will be potential candidates, in which dye MA-206 with increasing cyclopentadithiophene core displays the best performance in the designed system. Comparative investigation can provide a train of thought to design and screen out high performance dyes.
1. Introduction
The utilization and development of solar energy is one of the most important methods to cope with the solve energy crisis. Solar cells have attracted wide attention from the viewpoint of the academic research and practical application. As a way of energy utilization, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) with photoelectric conversion efficiency (PCE) of 7.1% were first reported by Grätzel and coworkers in 1991.1 Compared with silicon solar cells, DSSCs have a series of advantages,2–6 such as relative high theoretical efficiency, convenient synthesis, low cost and strong light harvesting ability. Therefore, exploring high efficiency DSSCs has important significance. The components of the DSSCs include counter electrode,7 sensitizer,8,9 electrolyte10 and photoanode,11,12 which will affect the performance of the overall device. Among them, sensitizer is a vital part to improve the power conversion efficiency (PCE) and stability of the DSSCs.13 Over the past decades, a series of dyes were designed and synthesized to improve device performance in theory and experiment.14–16 The category of dyes can be divided into the metal complexes17 and metal-free organic dyes,18 respectively. The former class (such as Ru or Zn-based dyes) has higher efficiency compared with the latter. Up to now, the PCE of Ru and Zn-based dyes have exceeded 13%.14 However, the large-scale application of the former class of DSSCs has been limited for their environmental pollution, scarce precious metals and other issues.19,20 Therefore, metal-free organic dyes are considered as an alternative to metal complexes, which are widely used in DSSCs due to the lower cost, simple synthesized process, variety structure and high molar extinction coefficient.21,22 Many dyes (such as perylene,23 cyanine,24 hemicyanine,25 coumarin,26 merocyanine,27 indoline28 and so on) have been successfully used as sensitizers in DSSCs, which exhibit PCE between 5 and 12%. Recently, Eom et al.29 designed a series of D–π–A dyes with different π-spacer to improve PCE, showing that TPA-based sensitizer with thienothiophene exhibits higher PCE of 7.40%, VOC of 694 mV, JSC of 14.38 mA cm−2 and fill factor of 0.74. Chiu et al.30 synthesized four novel organic dyes (H−1, H−2, H−3, H−4). H−1 and H−3 showed the low charge recombination and high open-circuit voltage (VOC), where the H−3 exhibited high PCE of 7.55% (JSC = 16.96 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.705 V, FF = 0.64) under deoxycholic acid used as a coadsorbent. Xie et al.31 have studied C255 and C254 by density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT), showing that the C255 exhibits higher short circuit current density (JSC) and open circuit photovoltage (VOC) due to the lower exciton binding energy (EBE) and the larger electron dipole moment (μnormal). Furthermore, they designed three series of dyes to screen high performance candidates, showing that the six dyes exhibit superior performance in all dyes.
It is generally known that metal-free organic dyes with donor–spacer–acceptor (D–π–A) structure are generally considered to be potential sensitizers.32,33 This structure facilitates intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) from donor (D) to the acceptor (A). Many researchers have improved DSSCs performance by designing new metal-free organic dyes. Carboxylic acid is the most common acceptor group for adsorption on TiO2 surface, which can ensure higher electron injection due to strong binding between the dye and the TiO2. In addition, carboxyl acid and rhodanine-3 acetic acid are also used as electron acceptor group. Although many works have been paid attention to the D–π–A structure, there are still some questions to deal with; for example, D–π–A structure may lead to charge recombination and dye aggregation, which is not conducive to electron injection.34,35
As compared, the use of double-anchoring dyes is an effective way to increase the electron injection into the TiO2 channel and charge transfer efficiency, and inhibit the electron recombination and enhancing the performance of DSSCs.36–39 Recently, two A–D–π–D–A type organic dyes (MA-1 and MA-2) with the two anchoring acceptor groups were designed and synthesized by Murali et al.40 MA-2 showed a higher PCE of 6.87% (JSC = 13.1 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.73 V and FF = 0.72), which use phenothiazine as donor, the 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole as π-spacer and carboxylic acid as acceptor. Phenothiazine-based dyes are widely used in DSSCs and show excellent performances.41 Because the π-spacer plays an important role in tuning photo physical properties of DSSCs and controlling intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) from donor to acceptor, the choice and design of a suitable π-spacer are one of the important ways to improve the efficiency of DSSCs. Some research reported the improvement of active photoresponse in broader wavelength region and light harvesting efficiency by the extension of π-conjugation in the molecular engineering.42–44 In current work, we have designed six dyes MA-201–MA-206 based on the MA-2 by introducing different core spacers (that is: thienothiophene; dithieno-[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]-thiophene; fluoro-substituted benzodithiophene; 4,4-dimethyl-4H-cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene; diphenyl-substituted dithienosilole; cyclopentadithiophene core), as shown in Fig. 1. These π-spacers are common and have been extensively studied in different experiments and theories. We find that these π-spacers have similar characteristics, we call the thiophene derivatives. For the designed double-anchoring dyes, the several parameters, such as the light harvesting efficiency (LHE), electron injection efficiency (ϕinj), total reorganization energy (λtotal), electron dipole moment (μnormal), radiative lifetime (τ), ionization potential (IP), electron affinity (EA), ultrafast electron injection simulation and chemical parameters, etc. have been studied in order to establish relationship between structure and performance. Our aims are paid attention to reveal the photochemical and photo-physical nature of double-anchoring dyes and insight into the influence of different π-spacer on the performance of DSSCs. We hope our work can provide a train of thought to design and screen out high performance dyes.

2. Computational details
All the calculations were carried out by using Gaussian 09 package.45 The ground state geometry of all dyes before and after binding to TiO2 in DMF solvent were optimized at density functional theory (DFT)46,47 through B3LYP48 functional alone with 6-31G(d)49 basis set for non-metal (C, H, O, N, S) atoms and LANL2DZ50 basis set for Ti atom. The dihedral angles, bond lengths, frontier molecular orbitals, energy levels (HOMO and LUMO) and chemical reactivity parameters (such as chemical hardness, electron accepting power, electrophilicity index, maximum charge transfer and chemical potential) were obtained based on the optimized ground state structures. The cationic and anionic states of dyes were optimized at the same level to calculate ionization potentials, electron affinities and reorganization energies. The light harvesting efficiencies, driving force of electron injection and absorption characteristics (such as maximum absorption wavelengths and oscillator strengths) of all dyes before and after binding to TiO2 in DMF solvent were calculated at time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT)51 through CAM-B3LYP52 functional alone with 6-31G(d) basis set for non-metal (C, H, O, N, S) atoms and LANL2DZ basis set for Ti atom. The solvent effect was undertaken using conductor-like polarizable continuum model (CPCM).53 The emission characteristics of dyes were also calculated at the same level.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Ground state geometries
The stick structure (see Scheme 1) of dyes optimized at DFT/B3LYP/6-31G(d) in DMF, and the selected parameters (bond length and bond angle) are listed in Table 1. The dihedral angles (Φ1/Φ4) between the donor and acceptor are −1.58°/1.15°, 0.39°/0.68°, −0.14°/0.63°, 0.20°/0.61°, 0.64°/0.81° and 0.57°/0.69° for dyes MA-201–MA-206, respectively, which are all close to 0°. Compared with MA-2 (4.20°/1.77°), all the designed dyes MA-201–MA-206 have smaller dihedral angles (Φ1/Φ4), which mean that donor and acceptor is more in a plan. The planarity indicated that the excited electrons in designed dyes MA-201–MA-206 are more easily transferred from donor to acceptor compared to MA-2. The dihedral angles (Φ2/Φ3) between the donor and π-spacer are −23.63°/22.60°, 25.35°/25.28°, −24.96°/23.40°, 19.41°/−21.94°, 25.51°/−20.57° and −22.19°/19.25° for designed dyes MA-201–MA-206, respectively. The results show that designed dyes can not only suppress π-aggregation but also increase the conjugation due to the smaller dihedral angles (Φ2/Φ3) compared to MA-2. Hence those core spacers are considered as efficient linkers between two donors, leads to the high VOC values. All the dyes have the same donor (phenothiazine) and acceptor (carboxylic acid), with different π-spacer. Therefore, the different π-spacer obviously affects the ground-state geometrical structure. The bond lengths of all dyes have no significant change with different π-spacer. For example, the values of d1, d2, d3 and d4 in all dyes have the difference of 0.006 Å, 0.017 Å, 0.017 Å and 0.004 Å. MA-2 exhibits relatively large bond lengths, and the values of d1, d2, d3 and d4 are 1.443 Å, 1.479 Å, 1.479 Å and 1.442 Å, respectively. The designed dyes MA-201–MA-206 show the small bond lengths than that of MA-2. The values of bond length in all dyes are shorter than C–C single bond.

3.2 Electronic structures and energy levels
Energy levels and frontier molecular orbitals have an important influence on electron excitation and electron transition.20,54,55 The HOMO−1, HOMO, LUMO, LUMO+1 and LUMO+2 of dyes MA-201–MA-206 and MA-2 are shown in Fig. 2. The results indicate that the LUMO levels of dyes MA-201–MA-206 and MA-2 lie above the conduction band (CB) of the TiO2 (−4.0 eV), which should ensure the fast and efficient electron injection from the excited sensitizer to the TiO2 conduction band. Furthermore, the HOMO levels of dyes MA-201–MA-206 and MA-2 are below the redox potential of I−/I3− electrolyte (−4.6 eV),56 which should facilitate the dye regeneration. According to the above analyses, those dyes are better photosensitizer candidates. In this sense, the regeneration ability of the dye is determined by HOMO level, and the higher HOMO level is beneficial to improve regeneration ability. As shown in Table 2, MA-206 (−4.68 eV) has the higher HOMO level, followed by MA-204 (−4.85 eV), MA-205 (−4.96 eV), MA-201 (−5.07 eV), MA-203 (−5.08 eV), MA-202 (−5.12 eV) and MA-2 (−5.32 eV), respectively. Therefore, the regeneration ability of dyes has the same trend, indicating that different π-spacer has an effect on HOMO level. The HOMO−1 of dyes MA-201–MA-206 and MA-2, lying at about −5.45, −5.50, −5.50, −5.39, −5.40, −5.37 and −5.53 eV (see Table S1, ESI†), which is about 0.38, 0.38, 0.42, 0.54, 0.44, 0.99 and 0.21 eV below their respective HOMO. The LUMO of MA-201–MA-206 has no obvious change, which is in the range of −2.58 to −2.60 eV and slightly higher compared to MA-2 (−2.63 eV). This indicates that different π-spacer has no obvious effect on LUMO level. The LUMO−1 of dyes MA-201–MA-206 and MA-2 is very close to that of LUMO, and the values are −2.52, −2.53, −2.53, −2.50, −2.51, −2.51 and −2.54 eV, respectively. The LUMO+2 of dyes MA-201–MA-206 and MA-2, which is about 0.82, 0.74, 0.41, 0.71, 0.55, 0.63 and 0.08 eV above that of LUMO+1.

The energy gap is an important factor affecting the PCE of DSSCs. Dye with lower energy gap is beneficial to electron excitation and higher light-harvesting efficiency. Hence, dyes can absorb more photons after photo-excitation, which leads to higher short circuit current density (JSC) and PCE.57 As shown in Fig. 2, we can find that the HOMO is shifted upward, while the LUMO is almost unchanged, which leads to the energy gap between HOMO and LUMO of dyes MA-201–MA-206 are smaller than that of MA-2. The energy gaps of all dyes are in decreasing order; MA-2 (2.69 eV) > MA-202 (2.52 eV) > MA-203 (2.48 eV) > MA-201 (2.47 eV) > MA-205 (2.37 eV) > MA-204 (2.26 eV) > MA-206 (2.10 eV) (see Table 2). Therefore, dyes MA-201–MA-206 may exhibit a larger short circuit current density (JSC) compared to MA-2 (13.1 mA cm−2). A designed dye (MA-206) with cyclopentadithiophene core has smallest energy gap, and a molecule with a small energy gap is regarded as soft molecule that is more polarizable compared to the hard molecule due to they need lower energy to excitation.58
Projected density of state (PDOS) analysis is beneficial to understand excitation properties of dyes. In order to further observe the electron density distribution of each dye, the molecular orbital compositions of A1, D1, π-spacer, D2 and A2 for HOMO, LUMO, LUMO+1 and LUMO+2 are shown in Fig. 3, and the values are listed in Table S2 (ESI†). The orbital densities of HOMO for dyes MA-201–MA-206 and MA-2 are focused in D1–π-spacer–D2 part, which are 95%, 97%, 97%, 96%, 96%, 99% and 94% (see Table S2, ESI†), respectively. For HOMO, the orbital densities of dyes MA-2, MA-201, MA-202 and MA-205 are mainly localized on the D1 part, and the values are 53, 53, 40 and 41, respectively; other dyes (MA-203, MA-204 and MA-206) are mainly localized on the π-spacer, and the values are 38, 47 and 71, respectively. For LUMO, the orbital densities of MA-2 are concentrated in π-spacer, which is 91%. The orbital densities of MA-201, MA-202, MA-204 and MA-205 are mainly centered at the A2 part, while a relatively small amount of orbital densities are focused in D2 part, and the values are 64% (A2) and 34% (D2) for MA-201, 66% (A2) and 32% (D2) for MA-202, 64% (A2) and 29% (D2) for MA-204, 57% (A2) and 24% (D2) for MA-205. The orbital densities of MA-203 and MA206 are mainly concentrated in the A1 part, and a relatively small number of orbital densities are localized on D1 part, which are decomposed as 60% (A1)/27% (D1) and 66% (A1)/31% (D1), respectively. For LUMO+1, the orbital densities of MA-2, MA-201, MA-202, MA-204 and MA-205 are mainly centered at the A1 part, while a relatively small amount of orbital densities are focused in D1 part, and the orbital densities of MA-203 and MA-206 are mainly centered at the A2 part, while a relatively small amount of orbital densities are focused in D2 part. For LUMO+2, the orbital densities of MA-201–MA-206 are mainly centered at the π-spacer, while a relatively small amount of orbital densities are focused in D1 and D2 part. MA-2 is mainly concentrated in the A2 part (67%), and a relatively small number of orbital densities can be found on D2 part (31%). These values showed that this better charge separation is beneficial to electron injection from the excited dye to the conduction band of the semiconductor upon photoexcitation. The PDOS analysis has a close relationship with frontier molecular orbitals diagram (Fig. 4), which is helpful to further understand the relationship between the electronic structure and electron transition.

In order to further explore ICT process of dyes MA-201–MA-206 and MA-2, two parameters DCT and S were calculated, as listed in Table 3. The DCT is defined as distance between two barycentres of the electron density accumulation (ρ+) and density depletion (ρ−) distribution upon the electronic excitation. The trend of DCT is MA-201 > MA-204 > MA-202 > MA-205 > MA-2 > MA-203 > MA-206. The larger DCT value indicates the stronger ICT extent, which will enhance the efficiency of DSSCs. The S is the integral of the overlap of hole–electron distribution, which could be taken as the choke point of ICT. The bigger S value is favorable for promoting ICT occurs.59 The sequence of S is MA-206 > MA-203 > MA-205 > MA-204 > MA-201 = MA-202 > MA-2, indicating that introducing different core spacers will enhance the ICT.

3.3 Vibrational spectral analysis
The vibrational frequencies of dyes MA-201–MA-206 and MA-2 were calculated at the DFT method using 6-31G(d) basis set, and the fourier transforms infrared spectra (FT-IR) and Raman spectrum (FT-Raman) are shown in Fig. 5 and 6, respectively. It can be shown from Fig. 5 that the strongest IR intensity band of MA-2 at vibrational mode 261 near about 1624.11 cm−1, which is the swing vibration of C–H bonds. The next stronger IR intensity band of MA-2 is assigned to vibrational mode 240 near about 1516.09 cm−1, corresponding to swing vibration of C–H bonds.

3.4 Molecular electrostatic potential (MEP)
In order to examine the differential mutagenicities among these dyes, and molecular electrostatic potential (MEP) were calculated at B3LYP/6-31G(d), as shown in Fig. 7. Molecular electrostatic potential (MEP) can be used to predict and describe reactive regions for nucleophilic attack and electrophilic attack, and the different colors at the surface represent the different values of molecular electrostatic potential (MEP). The electrostatic potential is in increasing order red < orange < yellow < green < blue. The color code of molecular electrostatic potential (MEP) maps ranges from −0.06 a.u. (deepest red) to 0.06 a.u. (deepest blue). The MEP of all the dyes indicates that the most positive potential is found on carboxyl hydrogen atom, indicating the prefer site for nucleophilic attack. The greatest negative potential is observed on nitrogen atom of –CN group, which is the preferred area of electrophilic attack.

3.5 Optical properties
In order to find the most reliable method for calculating the absorption spectra, four kinds of functional, including ωB97XD, CAM-B3LYP, MPW1PW91 and B3PW91 with 6-31G(d) basis set in DMF solution via conductor-like polarizable continuum model (CPCM),48 were used to evaluate the absorption spectra of MA-2, and the results were listed in Fig. 8. Compared with the experimental value, it was found that the CAM-B3LYP functional is more close to experimental value among four functionals (see Fig. 8), which can more accurately describe the absorption spectra. Therefore, CAM-B3LYP functional is used to evaluate the optoelectronic properties of dyes MA-201–MA-206 and MA-2. Many previous studies have also found that CAM-B3LYP can accurately characterize UV-vis absorption spectra.60,61

The photophysical parameters (oscillator strengths, excitation energies, maximum absorption wavelengths and main electron transition) of dyes MA-201–MA-206 and MA-2 are summarized in Table 3, where the S1, S2 and S3 states are shown, and the other states (S4, S5 and S6) are given in Table S3 (ESI†). Spectra range of original molecule and designed exhibits a broader visible absorption, which is similar with di-anchoring organic dye based on phenothiazine.62 The electronic transition type of the first excited state (S1) contains three types: HOMO to LUMO (MA-2 and MA-202), HOMO to LUMO+1 (MA-201 and MA-204) and HOMO to LUMO+2 (MA-203, MA-205 and MA-206). The maximum absorption peaks (S1) of dyes are in following order; MA-206 (458 nm) > MA-2 (452 nm) > MA-204 (447 nm) > MA-205 (446 nm) > MA-201 (439 nm) = MA-203 (439 nm) > MA-202 (414 nm). Compared to MA-2, only MA-206 shows a slight red shift by 6 nm, while MA-201–MA-205 show the blue shift about 13, 38, 13, 5 and 6 nm, respectively. The light absorption probability of the dye depends on the molar extinction coefficient (ε). A dye with larger ε will exhibits higher light absorption probability, which is beneficial to enhance PCE.63 The values of ε are in decreasing order: MA-206 > MA-202 > MA-204 > MA-205 > MA-203 >MA-201 > MA-2 (see Table 3). Even though maximum absorption peaks (S1) of MA-201–MA-205 are blue shifted, those dyes (MA-201–MA-206) exhibit lower energy gap and higher molar extinction coefficient compared to reference dye MA-2. Hence, dyes MA-201–MA-206 will exhibit higher light harvesting efficiency than MA-2. For this second transition (S2), charge transfer (CT) transition from HOMO or HOMO−1 to LUMO or LUMO+1. Absorption spectra (see Fig. 9) shows that MA-201–MA-206 exhibit a broad absorption band compared to MA-2 in the visible region, which is beneficial to improve the efficiency.

3.6 Ionization potentials, electron affinities and chemical reactivity study
The ionization potential (IP) represents the energy change of adding holes or extracting electrons, which can be calculated as the energy difference between cation and neutral molecule. The electron affinity (EA) implies the energy change of absorbing electrons or extracting holes, which can be calculated as the energy difference between neutral and anion molecule.64 IP and EA can be defined as: EA = Eneutral − Eanion IP = Ecation − Eneutral(1)
Ionization potential and electron affinity can be used to predict the transport barrier of hole and electron,65 and the results are listed Table 4. As shown in Table 4, the ionization potential (IP) values of dyes MA-201–MA-206 are smaller than MA-2 by 0.26, 0.22, 0.25, 0.47, 0.37 and 0.66 eV, respectively, indicating that dyes MA-201–MA-206 have slightly higher hole creating ability than MA-2. The electron affinity (EA) values of dyes MA-201–MA-206 are in the range of 2.87–2.89 eV, there is no obvious change compared to MA-2 (2.91 eV).

The chemical reactivity parameters such as: chemical hardness (η), electronaccepting power (ω+), electrophilicity index (ω), the maximum charge transfer (ΔNmax), back donation (ΔEback-donation) and chemical potential (μ) are also important factors affecting the performance of the DSSCs. The chemical hardness (η) represents the resistance to charge transfer.66,67 As shown in Table 4, MA-206 exhibit the lowest chemical hardness (0.77 eV), followed by MA-204 (0.86 eV), MA-205 (0.91 eV), MA-201 and MA-203 (for both η = 0.96 eV), MA-202 (0.98 eV) and MA-2 (1.08 eV). Dye with a small chemical hardness facilitates intramolecular charge transfer (ICT), and then electron injection into conduction band (CB) of the TiO2, leading to higher short circuit current density (JSC). Hence, dyes MA-201–MA-206 will present higher short circuit current density (JSC) compared to MA-2 (13.1 mA cm−2), which is beneficial to improve efficiency of DSSCs.
The electronaccepting power (ω+) signifies the capability to accept charge.68 Dye with a higher electronaccepting power (ω+) can more effectively attract electrons from donor, which facilitates larger short circuit current density (JSC). The values of electronaccepting power (ω+) are in following order: MA-206 (6.91 eV) > MA-204 (6.33 eV) > MA-205 (6.07 eV) > MA-201 (5.94 eV) > MA-203 (5.92 eV) > MA-202 (5.85 eV) > MA-2 (5.53 eV), and thus, dyes MA-201–MA-206 have the higher electron-withdrawing ability compared to MA-2. Dyes with the higher electronaccepting power (ω+) and lower chemical hardness (η) will exhibit larger short circuit current density (JSC), and then dyes show the better efficiency.69 Above all, dyes MA-201–MA-206 will present superior performance than MA-2 due to the higher electronaccepting power (ω+) and lower chemical hardness (η).
According to Parr et al. report,70 the electrophilicity index (ω) is regarded as a new depictor to quantify the global electrophilic power of the molecular system, who have proposed electrophilicity index (ω) as a measure of energy lowering owing to maximal electron flow between donor and acceptor. Generally, a good electrophile will present a high electrophilicity index (ω) value. The electrophilicity index (ω) has a trend similar to the electronaccepting power (ω+). The values of electrophilicity index (ω) indicate that dyes MA-201–MA-206 are superior electrophile than MA-2.
The maximum charge transfer (ΔNmax) describes the tendency of the molecule to acquire additional electron from the environment, and the electrophilicity index implies the charge capacity of the molecule. For the maximum charge transfer, the similar effect can also be observed in the electrophilicity index. The results show that dyes MA-201–MA-206 have the maximum charge transfer than MA-2.
An electronic back-donation process is the interaction between the metal surface and the inhibitor molecule.71 It includes the two possible processes for inhibitor–metal system (one is the electron donating process from metal to inhibitor molecule, and the other is the provision of a certain charge from molecule) owing to own character (such as the active site and electronic density distribution, etc.),72 and the two energy change for stabilization is directly correlated with the chemical hardness (η), as expressed as the follows: (2)The formula indicates that when chemical hardness (η) is positive, and the back donation (ΔEback-donation) is negative. It is possible to balance the stability in the inhibitor–metal system, and the stabilization will increase along with the increasing hardness, displaying the well interaction through donation and back donation process. As shown in Table 4, dyes MA-201–MA-206 have the higher back donation (ΔEback-donation) compared to MA-2, indicating that dyes MA-201–MA-206 are the preeminent inhibitor than MA-2, and this trend is also supported by the chemical hardness and ΔNmax analysis.
3.7 Nonlinear optical properties (NLO)
In order to study the relationship between geometric structures, photocurrent generation and nonlinear optical properties, the polarizability and hyperpolarizability were calculated at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level in DMF solution, which are helpful to understand the mechanics of molecular electronics.73 Nonlinear optical properties describe the response of a system in an applied electric field. Nonlinear optical properties have received wide attention due to the greater number of applications in emerging technology areas, such as signal processing, information storage, optical interconnections and telecommunications.74–77 The isotropic polarizability (α) can be performed by using the following formula:78 (3)
The first hyperpolarizability (βtot) is the third derivative of the energy which can be described by 3 × 3 × 3 matrix. The 27 components of 3D matrix can be reduced to 10 components because of the Kleinman symmetry.79 The 10 components of this matrix (βxxx, βxxy, βxyy, βyyy, βyyy, βxxz, βxyz, βyyz, βxzz, βyzz and βzzz) and polarizability (αxx,αxy,αyy,αxz,αyz and αzz) tensors can be obtained by the Gaussian output file, and the values are given in Tables 5 and 6. The first hyperpolarizability can be obtained by the following equation:80 (4)

The values of polarizability and hyperpolarizability of Gaussian output file are in atomic units (a.u.), the calculated values have been converted into electronic units (esu) (α; 1 a.u. = 0.1482 × 10−24 esu, β; 1 a.u. = 8.6393 × 10−33 esu). The higher molecular polarizability not only exhibits a strong interaction with the surrounding species, but also causes an increase in the local concentrations of acceptor species.81 From Table 5, it was found that the isotropic polarizability of dyes MA-201–MA-206 are larger than that of MA-2; therefore, the local concentration of acceptor species is enhanced at the TiO2 surface, which is beneficial to increase the possibility that the acceptor species penetrate the dye adsorption layer. The dyes MA-201–MA-206 have superior sensitizing property due to the higher isotropic polarizability. The hyperpolarizability are listed in Table 6, and the values are in following order; MA-206 > MA-204 > MA-205 > MA-203 > MA-201 > MA-202 > MA-2. We can observe that dyes MA-201–MA-206 possess higher polarizability and hyperpolarizability than those of MA-2, which may produce more photoelectrons induced electron transfer in the excited state. They are also potential candidates for nonlinear optical materials. As mentioned in Section 3.2, molecule with a small energy gap is more polarizable. It can be concluded from Tables 5 and 6 that dyes MA-201–MA-206 have higher polarizable compared to MA-2.
3.8 Factors influencing photovoltaic performance of DSSCs
As we have known, the photovoltaic performance of DSSCs is usually described by PCE (η), which is closely related to the short circuit current density (JSC) and open circuit photovoltage (VOC). And it can be evaluated by following equation:13 (5)where Pinc is the intensity of the incident light and FF is the fill factor.
Unfortunately, the specific values of the short circuit current density and open circuit photo voltage cannot be calculated directly from the theoretical method. We can use other parameters to estimate the short circuit current density, and it can be expressed as:82 (6)where LHE(λ) is the light harvesting efficiency, ϕinj is the electron injection efficiency, and the ηcoll is the charge collection efficiency. All components in the same DSSCs are the same except for the sensitizers, and ηcoll can be regarded as a constant. Hence, LHE(λ) and ϕinj are two important factors that affect the short circuit current density. According to eqn (6), the larger LHE(λ) is beneficial to improve the short circuit current density. LHE can be expressed as:83 LHE = 1 − 10−f(7)where f denotes the oscillator strength at the maximum absorption peak λmax. From eqn (6), in order to achieve high short circuit current density, the ϕinj should be as large as possible. ϕinj is related to the driving force of electron injection (ΔGinject), which is described by:84 ϕinj ∝ f(ΔGinject)(8)
According to the above formula, we can see that the more negative ΔGinject, the greater ϕinj, which is beneficial to the increase the short circuit current density (JSC). The ΔGinject is defined by the following formula:85 ΔGinject = Edye* − ECB = Edye + E0–0 − ECB(9)where Edye* is the excited-state oxidation potential of the dyes, and Edye (−HOMO energy level) is the ground state oxidation potential of the dye, and E0–0 is the vertical transition energy associated to the λmax, and ECB is the reduction potential of the conduction band of the TiO2 (ECB = −4.0 eV).86
In DSSCs, the open circuit photovoltage (VOC) is represented as energy difference between the redox potential of electrolyte and the quasi-Fermi potential of electrons in the conduction band of the TiO2, which can be calculated by the following formula:87 (10)where q represents the elementary charge of the electron; ECB is the conduction band edge (CBE) of the semiconductor; kbT is the thermal energy; nc and NCB represent the number of electrons and density of accessible states in the conduction band, respectively, and Eredox represents the electrolyte Fermi level. ΔECB is the shift of ECB when the dye adsorbs on the TiO2 substrate and can be expressed as:88 (11)where μnormal denotes the dipole moment component of dye molecule perpendicular to the surface of TiO2; γ represents the molecular surface concentration. ε0 and ε represent the dielectric permittivity in vacuum and monolayer of dye molecules, respectively. According to eqn (10) and (11), the dye with larger μnormal would exhibit higher open circuit photovoltage (VOC).
In order to better predict the short circuit current density of dyes, the main parameters (LHE and ΔGinject) are calculated, and the results are listed in Table 7. According to eqn (7), LHE is determined by the oscillator strength. In order to obtain high LHE, the oscillator strength should be as large as possible. The oscillator strengths of dyes are in decreasing order (see Table 3): MA-206 (2.4062) > MA-202 (1.7312) > MA-203 (1.5308) > MA-204 (1.4343) > MA-205 (1.2388) > MA-201 (1.1196) > MA-2 (0.7044), and the values of LHE (see Table 7) are 0.996, 0.981, 0.971, 0.963, 0.942, 0.924 and 0.802 for MA-206, MA-202, MA-203, MA-204, MA-205, MA-201 and MA-2, respectively. The results show that dyes MA-201–MA-206 will have higher the short circuit current density (JSC) than MA-2 (13.1 mA cm−2). The negative value of ΔGinject means that excited state dye lies above the conduction band (CB) of the TiO2, which is favor to electron injection from the excited sensitizer to the TiO2 conduction band. The ΔGinject values of dyes are in decreasing order; MA-2 (−1.42 eV) > MA-203 (−1.74 eV) > MA-201 (−1.75 eV) > MA-205 (−1.82 eV) > MA-202 (−1.88 eV) > MA-204 (−1.92 eV) > MA-206 (−2.03 eV). Dyes MA-201–MA-206 have more negative ΔGinject values than that of MA-2, suggesting that they will exhibit faster electron injection. At the same time, the ϕinj of dyes MA-201–MA-206 are higher than MA-2 due to their more negative ΔGinject. Therefore, dyes MA-201–MA-206 will exhibit larger short circuit current density (JSC) than that of MA-2 (13.1 mA cm−2) according to eqn (6). As known, the dyes with lower Edye* exhibit the higher photooxidization. From Table 7, MA-206 is the best photooxidized dyes, followed by MA-204, MA-202, MA-205, MA-201, MA-205, MA-203 and MA-2. The short-circuit photocurrent (JSC) is also influenced by the reorganization energy (ΔGreg). ΔGreg can be expressed as (ΔGreg = E(I3−/I−) − Edye).89 As shown in Table 7, the reorganization energy (ΔGreg) of dyes MA-201–MA-206 are in the range of 0.08 to 0.52 eV, which are lower than A1 (0.72 eV). Hence dyes P1–P6 with lower reorganization energy (ΔGreg) will have higher power conversion efficiency.90

Furthermore, the kinetics of electron injection affects the performance of DSSCs, based on the Marcus electron transfer theory,91 which can be approximately described as: (12)where V is the charge transfer coupling constant, ħ is Plank's constant, T is the temperature, kB is the Boltzmann constant and λtotal is the reorganization energy. All the factors in eqn (12) are treated as constants except for reorganization energy. Therefore, the kinetics of electron injection is affected by the reorganization energy. In addition to increasing the LHE and ϕinj to improve short circuit current density (JSC), reduce the reorganization energy is also an important factor to enhance short circuit current density (JSC). Generally, the reorganization energy can be divided into two parts; one is the external reorganization energy, and another is the internal reorganization energy.92,93 However, the external reorganization energy exhibits a tiny relationship with the kinetics of electron injection and has no significant effect on the electron transfer. So we only focus on the internal reorganization energy and ignore the external reorganization energy, and the calculation of the hole reorganization energy is shown in Fig. 10.
 Fig. 10  Schematic representation for the calculation of hole reorganization energy, while curves represent the potential energies for the cationic and the neutral species. 
The hole reorganization energy (λh), electron reorganization energy (λe) and total reorganization energy (λtotal) are evaluated from the following formulas: λh = (E0+ − E+) + (E0+ − E0)(13) λe = (E0− − E−) + (E0− − E0)(14) λtotal = λh + λe(15)where E0− (E0+) is the energy of anion (cation) calculated with the optimized structure of the neutral molecule, E− (E+) is the energy of anion (cation) calculated with the optimized anion (cation) geometry, E0− (E0+) is the energy of neutral molecule calculated at the cationic (anionic) state and E0 is the energy of the neutral molecule in its ground state. The reorganization energy is another important factor affecting short circuit current density (JSC), and the smaller reorganization energy can facilitate election injection and increase short circuit current density (JSC).94 Therefore, the reorganization energy is calculated and the results are listed in Table 7. The total reorganization energies λtotal of dyes are in increasing order; MA-206 (0.62 eV), MA-204 (0.63 eV), MA-201, MA-205, MA-202 = MA-203, MA-2 (0.76 eV). Hence dyes MA-201–MA-206 have fast electron transfer and higher charge transfer rates compared to MA-2 due to the smaller total reorganization energy. Additionally, the balance of holes and electrons transport is very important for high performance DSSCs, dyes with the more balanced hole reorganization energy (λh) and electron reorganization energy (λe) can be regarded as better ambipolar material.94,95 The difference between hole reorganization energy (λh) and electron reorganization energy (λe) are 0.10, 0.07, 0.05, 0.09, 0.07, 0.15 and 0.14 eV for dyes MA-201–MA-206 and MA-2, respectively, indicating that dyes MA-201–MA-205 have better balanced transport rates than MA-2, and can be nice ambipolar OLED emitting materials. As shown in Table 7, the λh's for MA-201–MA-206 and MA-2 are all smaller than their respective λe's, implying that the hole transfer rate is higher than the electron transfer rate. Hole reorganization energy (λh) and electron reorganization energy (λe) of dyes MA-201–MA-206 are smaller than that of MA-2, suggesting that dyes MA-201–MA-206 have good hole and electron transfer capability compared to MA-2. Above all, dyes MA-201–MA-206 have higher LHE, ΔGinject and lower reorganization energy, which will result in short circuit current density (JSC) for better PCE of DSSC.
In addition to the short circuit current density (JSC), the open circuit photovoltage (VOC) is another important factor affecting the efficiency. Eqn (10) and (11) show that there is a close relationship between dipole moment (μnormal) and open circuit photovoltage (VOC). A dye with larger dipole moment (μnormal) will induce more shift of conduction band edge (CBE), which will result in higher open circuit photovoltage (VOC). The calculated results (Table 7) show that dyes MA-201–MA-206 have larger dipole moment (μnormal) than that of MA-2. Hence, dyes MA-201–MA-206 will exhibit larger open circuit photovoltage (VOC) compared to MA-2 (0.728 V).
3.9 Emission characteristics
The emission properties (the emission peaks, oscillator strengths and fluorescence energies) of the dyes were calculated at the TD-DFT//CAM-B3LYP/6-31G(d) level in DMF solution, and the results are listed in Table 8. As shown, the emission peaks (λem) of dyes have higher wavelengths (∼100 nm) than their maximum absorption peaks (λmax). MA-203 exhibits highest λem at 579 nm which is 140 nm higher than its λmax, while MA-202 has lowest λem with 516 nm, which is 102 nm higher than its λmax. The emission peaks (λem) of dyes are in following order; MA-203 > MA-206 > MA-205 > MA-2 > MA-201 > MA-204 > MA-202. All dyes have same electronic transition from HOMO to LUMO. Compared to MA-2, it is clear that the emission peaks of MA-201, MA-202 and MA-204 show blue shift by 12, 25 and 13 nm, respectively, and the corresponding oscillator strengths are decreased by 0.3099, 0.1897 and 0.0713, respectively; dyes MA-203, MA-205 and MA-206 show red shift by 38, 17 and 33 nm, respectively, and the corresponding oscillator strengths increase by 0.3453, 0.3821 and 1.405, respectively.

Furthermore, the radiative lifetime was calculated by using the Einstein transition probabilities in the following equation:96 (16)where c is the velocity of light, Eflu is the fluorescence transition energy and f is oscillator strength. The calculated radiative lifetime of dyes are listed in Table 8, and the values are in following order; MA-201 (5.24 ns) > MA-202 (4.33 ns) > MA-204 (4.02 ns) > MA-2 (3.95 ns) > MA-203 (3.45 ns) > MA-205 (3.13 ns) > MA-206 (1.96 ns), which means that dyes MA-201, MA-202 and MA-204 have higher emission efficiency.
3.10 Adsorbed dyes onto the TiO2
The performance of DSSCs is determined not only by the isolated dye but also by the dye/TiO2 interface. In order to deeply observe the micromechanism under the dye/TiO2 interface, the electronic structure and charge transfer process of dye/TiO2 have been investigated using DFT. There are two ways in which the dye is adsorbed onto TiO2; (i) monodentate binding or (ii) bidentate binding. Some experimental studies show that acceptor group (typically carboxylic acid) is usually adsorbed on the TiO2via bidentate bridging.97 As shown in Fig. 1, dye has two anchoring acceptor groups. Dye adsorption on TiO2 may occur in two types: (i) only one anchoring moiety adsorption to TiO2, and (ii) the other is the two anchoring moieties will be adsorbed on the TiO2.

3.10.1 Only one anchoring moiety adsorption on TiO2. 
In order to further observe how the dye is adsorbed on TiO2, optimized geometries of dyes/T1 are presented in Fig. S2 (ESI†). The calculated two bond lengths (Ti–O) of dyes/T1 are in the range 2.06–2.10 Å. The Ti–O distances of dyes/T1 are different due to the proton transferred to surface O.98 Therefore, a shorter Ti–O distances will result in a strong interaction. In order to further investigate the electronic coupling between LUMO and the semiconductor conduction band, the energy level of dye/T1 was calculated, and the results are listed in Table S4 (ESI†), the corresponding energy level diagram of the dyes before and after binding on the TiO2 surface is presented in Fig. 11(a). The HOMO levels (see Table S4, ESI†) of dyes MA-201T1–MA-206T1 and MA-2T1 are −5.06, −5.10, −5.09, −4.85, −4.95, −4.67 and −5.35 eV, respectively. We can find that HOMO levels of dyes MA-201T1–MA-206T1 have a subtle incensement. The LUMO levels of dyes MA-201T1–MA-206T1 and MA-2T1 are −3.28, −3.26, −3.28, −3.29, −3.30, −3.28 and −3.27 eV, respectively, indicating that the LUMO levels have no obvious change. Dyes MA-201T1–MA-206T1 have smaller energy gap than that of MA-2T1 by 0.30, 0.24, 0.27, 0.52, 0.42 and 0.69 eV due to the relatively high HOMO levels. As shown in Fig. 11(a), it is obvious that the LUMO levels are decreased after binding on the TiO2 surface, and the values (see Table S4, ESI†) are 0.68, 0.66, 0.68, 0.70, 0.71, 0.70 and 0.64 eV for MA-201T1–MA-206T1 and MA-2T1, respectively, which means that the LUMO level of dyes have strong electronic coupling with TiO2 surface. The HOMO levels of dyes/T1 have no obvious change compared with that of the isolated dye, the difference is in the range 0.01–0.03 eV. After binding on the TiO2 surface, HOMO levels have no obvious change; while LUMO levels are decreased significantly, which leads to the significant decrease energy gaps about 0.61, 0.69, 0.68, 0.67, 0.70, 0.71 and 0.71 eV for MA-2T1 and MA-201T1–MA-206T1 compared to before binding on the TiO2 surface (see Fig. 11(a)).
 Fig. 11  The molecules energy level diagram of (a) dyes and dyes/T1, (b) dyes and dyes/T2 in DMF (dyes/T1 represents only one anchoring moiety adsorption to TiO2, dyes/T2 represents two anchoring moieties adsorption to TiO2). 
The electrons in the TiO2 conduction band can recombine with the oxidized dyes and electrolyte solution, the latter is an important factor limiting efficiency of DSSCs. Previous studies have shown that the indirect electrostatic attraction of iodine by the greatest negative potential of atom increase iodine concentration around the vicinity of TiO2, facilitating charge recombination.99 From Fig. 7, we can find that the greatest negative potential is observed on nitrogen atom of –CN group. Therefore, the electron-withdrawing group (–CN) of dyes were selected to study the electron recombination probability. The binding energies between nitrogen of –CN in dyes and I2 and the distances between lower I atom and TiO2 surface are shown in Fig. 12. The larger binding energy is beneficial to increase iodine concentration around the acceptor part, which will lead to the acceleration of electron recombination. As shown in Fig. 12, MA-204T1 has the smaller binding energy, followed by MA-201T, MA-2T, MA-205T, MA-203T, MA-202T and MA-206T. The distance between lower I atom and TiO2 surface can also affect electron recombination rate. The longer distance between I atom and TiO2 surface will lead to smaller electron recombination rate. There is no obvious change for all dyes in the distances.
 Fig. 12  Optimized geometries of dyes/T1–I2 system. 
Previous studies have shown that electronic and optical properties of dyes will change after binding on the TiO2 surface due to the interaction between the dye and TiO2. Hence, the UV/vis absorption spectra of the dye/T1 were simulated by using TD-DFT method. The maximum absorption wavelengths, transition energies and oscillator strengths of S1, S2 and S3 states are listed in Table 9, and all the 6 lowest singlet transitions are presented in Table S5 (ESI†). The maximum absorption wavelengths of MA-201T1–MA-206T1 and MA-2T1 are 444, 439, 450, 455, 432, 460 and 433 nm, respectively. The results show that MA-201T1, MA-202T1, MA-203T1, MA-204T1 and MA-206T1 showed red-shift absorption of 11, 6, 17, 22 and 27 nm compared to MA-2T1. The maximum absorption wavelengths of MA-201T1–MA-206T1 and MA-2T1 are derived from the HOMO → LUMO+8, HOMO−1 → LUMO+3, HOMO → LUMO+3, HOMO−1 → LUMO+3, HOMO → LUMO+8, HOMO→ LUMO+17 and HOMO → LUMO+3 electronic transition, respectively, and the corresponding frontier molecular orbitals are shown in Fig. 13(a). Those frontier molecular orbitals indicate that there is obvious the electron injection from dye into TiO2, which is beneficial to improve efficiency of DSSCs.

 Fig. 13  Major transition of dyes/T1 (a) and dyes/T2 (b) (dyes/T1 represents only one anchoring moiety adsorption to TiO2, dyes/T2 represents two anchoring moieties adsorption to TiO2). 
Absorption spectra of dyes/TiO2 are shown in Fig. 14, the results show that molar extinction coefficients of dyes/TiO2 are higher than that of isolated dye. The oscillator strength is an important factor affecting LHE, after binding on the TiO2 surface, MA-206T1 (2.1901) has the highest oscillator strength, followed by MA-202T1 (1.6661), MA-203T1 (1.6316), MA-204T1 (1.4505), MA-205T1 (1.4103), MA-2T1 (1.3623) and MA-201T1 (1.2545), respectively. As discussed above, the larger oscillator strength will lead to better LHE. LHE has similar trends with oscillator strength (see Table 10). The LHE is one of the important ways to improve the short circuit current density (JSC). Therefore, MA-202T1–MA-206T1 may have better photocurrent performance than MA-2T1. Compared to isolated dyes, the maximum absorption wavelengths of MA-201T1–MA-206T1 showed red-shift of 5, 25, 11, 8, 12 and 2 nm, respectively, while MA-2T1 showed blue-shift of 19 nm after binding on the TiO2 surface. In addition, dyes/T1 has higher oscillator strength compared with the isolated dyes except MA-202T1 and MA-206T1, which will lead to higher LHE (see Table 10). ΔGinject is another factor that affects the short circuit current density (JSC). As shown in Table 10, the ΔGinject values of dyes/T1 are in increasing order: MA-2T1 (−1.51 eV), MA-203T1 (−1.66 eV), MA-202T1 (−1.72 eV), MA-201T1 (−1.73 eV), MA-204T1 (−1.88 eV), MA-205T1 (−1.92 eV), MA-206T1 (−2.02 eV).

According to Newns-Anderson model, electron injection for dye/TiO2 was studied, and the time (in fs) is obtained by the following equations:94,100,101 (17) (18)where Δ is energetic broadening, pi is the adsorbate portion of every molecular orbital, εi is orbital energy, and ELUMO(ads) is the energy of the adsorbate's LUMO. When electrons were injected into the titanium dioxide, injection time was calculated to be 9.51 fs (MA-2), 9.12 fs (MA-201), 10.10 fs (MA-202), 4.61 fs (MA-203), 11.25 fs (MA-204), 15.5 fs (MA-205), 9.20 fs (MA-206), respectively. Among the designed dyes, the injection time of MA-201, MA-203 and MA-206 is smaller than that of original dye (MA-2). From the calculation of electron injection driving forces and injection times, it can be deduced that electron injection from excited state into TiO2 should take place easily for the above three dyes.


3.10.2 Two anchoring moieties adsorption on TiO2. 
After binding on the TiO2 surfaces, four bond lengths (Ti–O) of dyes/TiO2 are shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†), and the values are in the range 2.07–2.10 Å. There is no obvious change compared to dyes/T1 with only one anchoring moiety adsorption on TiO2. The HOMO and LUMO level of dyes/T2 are listed in Table S4 (ESI†), and the energy level diagram is shown in Fig. 11(b). The HOMO levels (see Table S4, ESI†) of dyes MA-201T2–MA-206T2 and MA-2T2 are −4.67, −5.12, −5.13, −5.11, −4.90, −4.99 and −5.36 eV, respectively. The results shown that MA-201T2–MA-206T2 have a slightly higher HOMO levels compared to MA-2T2. The LUMO levels are −3.30, −3.30, −3.28, −3.28, −3.27, −3.29 and −3.28 eV for MA-201T2–MA-206T2 and MA-2T2, respectively, there is no obvious change. Therefore MA-201T2–MA-206T2 have smaller energy gap than MA-2 due to the relatively high HOMO level, and the values are 1.82, 1.83, 1.83, 1.62, 1.72, 1.38 and 2.08 eV for MA-201T2–MA-206T2 and MA-2T2, respectively. Dye with lower energy gap is beneficial to electron excitation and higher light-harvesting efficiency. As shown in Fig. 11(b), after binding on the TiO2 surface, the LUMO levels have increased significantly compared to that of the isolated dyes, indicating that the LUMO levels of dyes have strong electronic coupling with TiO2 surface. HOMO levels of dyes/T2 have no obvious change compared with that of the isolated dye, and the difference is in the range 0.01–0.05 eV (see Table S4, ESI†). MA-201T2–MA-206T2 and MA-2T2 have smaller energy gap compared to that of the isolated dye due to lower LUMO levels. Whether one or two anchoring moieties adsorption on TiO2, the HOMO levels, LUMO levels and energy gaps have no obvious change (see Table S4, ESI†), and the difference is in the range 0.01–0.06, 0.01–0.04 and 0.01–0.06 eV for HOMO levels, LUMO levels and energy gaps.
After two anchoring moieties adsorption on TiO2, The maximum absorption wavelengths of MA-201T2–MA-206T2 and MA-2T2 are 472, 444, 455, 471, 474, 472 and 439 nm, respectively. Therefore, MA-201T2–MA-206T2 showed red-shift of 33, 5, 16, 32, 35 and 33 nm compared to MA-2T2, respectively. The electrons transition of dyes/T2 from HOMO to LUMO+6 except for that of the dye MA-205T2, whose major transition of maximum absorption wavelength is H → L+7, and the corresponding frontier molecular orbitals are shown in Fig. 13(b). The orbital densities of HOMO for MA-201T2–MA-206T2 and MA-2T2 have similar distribution. For LUMO+6 and LUMO+7, the orbital densities of LUMO+6 for MA-2T2 and MA-203T2 are localized on two TiO2 parts. The orbital densities of LUMO+6 for MA-201T2, MA-202T2, MA-204T2, MA-206T2 and the orbital densities of LUMO+7 for MA-205T2 have similar distribution, which are mainly localized on one TiO2 part. Those frontier molecular orbitals indicate that electrons can be efficiently injected into TiO2. Absorption spectra of dyes/T2 are shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†), we can find that dyes/T2 have highest molar extinction coefficient, followed by dyes/T1 and isolated dye. As mentioned in Section 3.3, the higher molar extinction coefficient is beneficial to improve light absorption probability and PCE. Therefore, double-anchoring dyes will exhibit outstanding performance. The oscillator strength of maximum absorption wavelength for dyes after binding on the TiO2 surfaces are in following order; MA-206T2 (2.5185) > MA-202T2 (2.1888) > MA-203T2 (1.8314) > MA-205T2 (1.5458) > MA-204T2 (1.4318) > MA-201T2 (1.4300) > MA-2T2 (1.3786). According to eqn (7), LHE has similar trends with oscillator strength (see Table 10). The larger LHE is beneficial to improve the short circuit current density (JSC). Hence, MA-201T2–MA-206T2 may have better photocurrent performance than MA-2T2.
Compared to isolated dyes, the maximum absorption wavelengths of MA-201T2, MA-202T2, MA-203T2, MA-204T2 and MA-206T2 showed red-shift of 33, 30, 16, 24 and 14 nm, respectively, while MA-2T2 and MA-205T2 showed the blue-shifted of 13 and 3 nm after binding on the TiO2 surface. Furthermore, dyes/T2 have higher oscillator strength compared with the isolated dyes except MA-204T2. According to eqn (7), dyes/T2 will exhibit higher LHE than isolated dyes except MA-204T2 (see Table 10). The short circuit current density (JSC) is also determined by ΔGinject, and the values are in decreasing order: MA-2T2 > MA-201T2 > MA-203T2 > MA-205T2 > MA-202T2 > MA-204T2 > MA-206T2. Dye MA-201T2–MA-206T2 exhibit more negative ΔGinject value than that of MA-2T2. Compared to isolated dye, only MA-2T2 has lower ΔGinject value, and MA-201T2–MA-206T2 increases slightly.
Compared to dyes/T1, the maximum absorption wavelengths of MA-2T2, MA-201T2, MA-202T2, MA-203T2, MA-204T2 and MA-206T2 showed the red-shifted about 6, 28, 5, 5 16 and 12 nm, respectively, while MA-205T2 showed the blue-shifted about 15 nm. After two anchoring moieties adsorbed on TiO2, all the dyes/T2 exhibit higher molar extinction coefficient than that of dyes/T1 (Fig. 15). Dyes/T2 have higher oscillator strength (see Table 9) than that of dyes/T1 except for MA-204T2, therefore, LHE (see Table 10) also has the same conclusion for dyes/T2 and dyes/T1. Dyes/T1 have more negative ΔGinject value than that of dyes/T2 (see Table 10).

4. Conclusions
In this work, we have designed the six dyes MA-201–MA-206 based on the MA-2 by introducing different core spacers (thienothiophene; dithieno-[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]-thiophene; fluoro-substituted benzodithiophene; 4,4-dimethyl-4H-cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene; diphenyl-substituted dithienosilole; cyclopentadithiophene core) in solar cell. For the designed double-anchoring dyes, the several parameters have been studied in order to establish relationship between structure and performance. It was found that: (a) substituted core spacers have improved the energy levels and spectra, where three dyes MA-204 with 4,4-dimethyl-4H-cyclopenta [2,1-b:3,4-b′] dithiophene, MA-205 with diphenyl-substituted dithienosilole and MA-206 with cyclopentadithiophene core have produced larger the red-shifted; (b) for the designed dyes, the short-circuit current density (JSC) and open-circuit voltage (VOC) should be increased in varying degree owing to the influence of core-substituted structure on the light-harvesting efficiency, electronaccepting power and driving force of electron injection, chemical hardness, reorganization energy, the injection time from excited state into TiO2 and dipole moment, etc. Taken two factors (injection driving force and times) into account, MA-206 with cyclopentadithiophene core possess the most ability of electron injection; (c) for double-anchoring dyes, it was found that after binding on the TiO2 surfaces, four bond lengths (Ti–O) of dyes/TiO2 is no obvious change compared to dyes/T1 with only one adsorption of anchoring moiety on TiO2. The HOMO and LUMO level of dyes/T2 have a slightly higher HOMO levels, and there is no obvious change for LUMO. By the two anchoring TiO2 model, MA-201T2–MA-206T2 showed obvious the red-shifted absorption, following by the higher molar extinction coefficient. At the same time, driving force energies for MA-201T2–MA-206T2 have increased slightly under the condition of two adsorption of anchoring moiety on TiO2.
Finally, by designing the six different core spacers dyes, their photoelectric properties have been improved compared with original dye, in which the MA-206 with cyclopentadithiophene core will display more well better photoelectric performance in rational molecular engineering of sensitizers combining high photovoltaic efficiency.
