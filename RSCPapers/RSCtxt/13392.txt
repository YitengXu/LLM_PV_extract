    , Accepted 2nd January 2017First published on 3rd January 2017AbstractA low cost and large scale synthetic approach was developed for colloidal PbS quantum dots (QDs). The heat up strategy was adapted for large scale production, thioacetamide in oleylamine (OLA) was used as the sulphur precursor for low cost and safe synthesis, and PbCl2 in OLA was used as the lead precursor for a well passivated surface. Due to the balance between the diffusion coefficient and monomer oversaturation generated by the dissolution of small particles, an optimum growth temperature exists in the new synthesis. The synthesis was easily scaled up to produce 18 g of PbS QDs from one reaction batch, with a high chemical yield of ∼80% and the as synthesized QDs exhibit a high photoluminescence quantum yield of >40% and excellent air-stability of at least 60 days, due to the Cl− and oleate co-passivation.
Introduction
Colloidal PbS quantum dots (QDs) have become important optoelectronic and electronic materials, due to their tunable absorption and luminescence wavelength, solution processability, a variety of techniques for ligand exchange, and the formation of thin films compatible with a wide range of lightweight, flexible substrates.1,2 For instance, PbS QDs have been successively used in low cost, highly efficient and stable solar cells.3–8 The record efficiency for PbS QD solar cells is close to 11.3%,4 indicating their potential for application in the near future. Photodetectors based on PbS QDs show ultrasensitive and fast response to both infrared and visible light.9–14 The PbS QD infrared photodetector exhibits a normalized detectivity D* of 1.8 × 1013 Jones, which is higher than the best epitaxially grown InGaAs detector at room temperature,10 and a high gain due to multiple exciton generation (MEG).13 The visible photodetector based on PbS QDs has achieved performance that is comparable to silicon devices, indicating the possibility for replacing the complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) and charge-coupled device (CCD) cameras.11 PbS QDs are also used to fabricate infrared light emitting diodes (LEDs). Wise et al.15 achieved electroluminescent power comparable to that produced by commercial InGaAsP LEDs by tuning the distance between adjacent PbS QDs, and the emission wavelength can be tuned in a large range from 800 to 1850 nm. Sargent et al.16 achieved a record electroluminescence power conversion efficiency of 4.9% by embedding PbS QDs in a high-mobility hybrid perovskite matrix. PbS QDs are promising materials for low cost and flexible field effect transistors (FETs) and circuits. Kagan et al.17 fabricated PbS QD FETs exhibiting nearly balanced, high mobilities for electrons and holes, which enabled the fabrication of CMOS-like inverters with promising gains of ∼22 from a single semiconductor material. Gas sensors are another application of PbS QDs. Tang et al.5,18 prepared a PbS QD gas sensor with rapid response, high sensitivity, good reversibility, and outstanding mechanical bending ability and robustness. Additionally, PbS QDs can be used as phosphors for luminescent solar concentrators (LSC). Rosei et al.19 used PbS/CdS core/shell QDs to fabricate a low reabsorption emission loss, highly efficient LSC, offering a promising pathway to integrating LSCs and photovoltaic devices with good spectral matching.
The extensive applications require the production of high quality PbS QDs. As nanoparticles, the QDs have very high surface-to-volume ratios, thus the surface dictates the properties of the QDs. Therefore, it is essential to passivate the surface atoms of QDs, which is usually accomplished by binding with organic ligands. In addition, halide passivation is necessary for high quality PbS QDs and their devices. The steric hindrance prevents organic ligands from penetrating the inter-cation trenches on the surface of QDs, resulting in incomplete surface passivation. The unpassivated surface sites are prone to attack by oxygen and/or water, leading to instability of the QDs in air. Recently, halide anions were found to be effective inorganic ligands in combination with traditional organic ligands, i.e. hybrid passivation.8,20–23 The halide atom is sufficiently compact to bind sites inaccessible to typical organic ligands.
For the most part, the introduction of halide anions is a post-synthesis process, either after the synthesis8 or in the solid/liquid ligand exchange.7,24,25 An in situ halide passivation is preferable because it enables better surface passivation and simplifies the procedure. The in situ passivation can be realized by incorporating halide precursors into the synthesis. Cademartiri et al.26 and Moreels et al.27,28 used PbCl2 as the lead precursor and sulphur in oleylamine (OLA) as the sulphur precursor to synthesize PbS QDs that showed much better stability in air and higher photoluminescence quantum yields (PL QYs), compared to the dots synthesized by the method using PbO as the lead precursor.29
Another requirement for widespread applications of PbS QDs is large scale and low cost synthesis. The mainstream strategy for the synthesis of QDs is hot injection, allowing fast nucleation and slow growth.30 However, hot injection is not suitable for large scale synthesis because it is difficult to inject a large volume of precursor in a short time and it takes some time to mix together the precursors. deMello et al.31 developed a microfluidic platform to synthesize PbS QDs, using PbO as the lead precursor, which has potential for large scale production. However, PbCl2 based large scale synthesis is desirable in terms of in situ and good surface passivation. A common method for large scale synthesis is the heat up strategy, which combines the reactants at room temperature and heats them to elevated temperatures that are maintained for a period of time.32,33 The reaction in the hot injection synthesis cannot be simply adopted in the heat up method, as the temperature control is completely different; thus, delicate design of precursors, ligands and solvent for a successful heat up synthesis is needed. Recently, Zhang et al.34 developed a heat up approach for high quality PbS QDs using bis(trimethylsilyl) sulphide (TMS2S) as the sulphur precursor and PbCl2 in OLA as the lead precursor. The PbS QDs showed excellent air-stability and high PL QYs and improved QD solar cell performance due to enhanced hybrid passivation. The synthesis was scaled up to produce 47 g of PbS QDs from one reaction batch. However, the sulphur precursor (TMS2S) is expensive, toxic and highly volatile; therefore, a cheap and safe sulphur precursor is needed for the PbCl2 based heat up synthesis. In the present work, we have found a suitable sulphur precursor for the low cost and large scale synthesis of PbS QDs that shows a high PL QY and excellent stability in air. The synthesis was easily scaled up to produce 18 g of PbS QDs from one batch, with a high chemical yield of ∼80%.
Experimental
Materials
Oleylamine (OLA, 80–90%), PbCl2 (99.99%) and ammonium sulfide (40–48 wt% in H2O) were purchased from Aladdin. Oleic acid (OA, tech. grade, 90%) and sulfur powder (99.5%) were purchased from Alfa Aesar. Thioacetamide (TAA, ≥99%), tetrachloroethylene (TCE, ≥98.5%), hexane (≥97%) and ethanol (≥99.7%) were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagents. All the chemicals were used as received.
Synthesis of PbS QDs
TAA (1 mmol) and 2 mL OLA were stirred at room temperature for 20 min in air, forming a light yellow solution that was used as the sulphur precursor. OLA (10 mL) and 3 mmol of PbCl2 were degassed under vacuum at 80 °C and heated to 140 °C under nitrogen, maintaining this temperature 30 min. The mixture was then cooled down to 30 °C and the sulphur precursor was injected, upon which the colour immediately changed to black. The reaction solution was heated to 50–100 °C and maintained for 10–60 min. At different intervals, aliquots of 50 μL reaction solution were withdrawn and dispersed in TCE for the measurement of absorption spectra. When the growth was finished, the solution was allowed to cool down, then 10 mL of hexane was injected at ∼70 °C and 8 mL of OA was injected at ∼40 °C to remove the unreacted PbCl2. Then, the PbS QDs were separated by centrifugation using ethanol as the nonsolvent. The product was washed one more time using hexane and ethanol. There was some white precipitate in the PbS QDs solution, which was removed by centrifugation and filtration.
Characterization
Optical absorption spectra were collected using a Shimadzu UV-3600 plus spectrophotometer. TEM images were obtained using a FEI Technai G2 20 microscope with a LaB6 filament operated at 200 kV. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were collected on a PANalytical X'Pert PRO. PL QY was measured using an Edinburgh FLS980 fluorescence spectrometer using an integrating sphere. The content of Cl was estimated by XPS on a Kratos AXIS-ULTRA DLD, and the sample was prepared by drop casting QD solution on ITO coated glass. The diameter and concentration of QDs were calculated using the relationship between the optical bandgap and QD size and the relationship between QD diameter and molar extinction coefficient given by Moreels et al.,27 following a previous procedure.34–36 The size distribution was estimated by fitting the absorption spectra, following a previous method.34 The chemical yield of the synthesis was determined based on particle number and the number of S atoms per QD, following our previous route.36
Results and discussion
Using the PbCl2 and OLA complex as the lead precursor gives rise to QDs capped with hybrid ligands. The heat up strategy is suitable for large scale production; therefore, we chose the PbCl2 based heat up method to develop a low cost and large scale route for high quality PbS QDs. Zhang et al.34 have shown that TMS2S can be used in the PbCl2 based heat up synthesis via a diffusion controlled growth mode. Here, we sought to find a cheaper and safer sulphur source to replace TMS2S. Additionally, a low temperature is preferred for the synthesis in terms of low cost. Sulphur dissolved in trioctylphosphine (TOPS) and tributylphoshpine (TBPS) are commonly used in the synthesis of colloidal metal sulphide QDs. However, their reactivity is too low to react with the PbCl2 and OLA complex at temperatures below 200 °C; above 200 °C, the PbCl2 and OLA complex is unstable.34 Sulphur dissolved in OLA (OLA-S) was usually used in the PbCl2 based hot injection synthesis.26,28 However, OLA-S is still not reactive enough for the heat up synthesis (ESI†). Ammonium sulphide is another cheap sulphur source used for the synthesis of a variety of metal sulphide quantum dots;37 it produces PbS QDs with very broad size distributions in the PbCl2 based heat up synthesis (ESI†). Finally, we found that TAA dissolved in OLA is adaptable. Fig. 1a shows the evolution of the absorption spectrum of PbS QDs synthesized from TAA when the temperature was increased from 30 to 150 °C. The PbS QDs were generated even at 30 °C, although the size distribution was very broad, demonstrated by the almost indistinguishable exciton peak, indicating that TAA in OLA is a highly reactive sulphur precursor. With the increase in the temperature, the exciton peak red shifted and became increasingly pronounced, suggesting that the heating promoted the growth of nanoparticles and more importantly, narrowed the size distribution. Therefore, it is possible to produce monodisperse QDs by heating the mixture of precursors. Accompanying the redshift, the height of the exciton peak decreased continuously, which is related to QD concentration via Lambert–Beer's law,38
 Fig. 1  Evolutions of absorption spectra of PbS QDs synthesized under different conditions: (a) the temperature was raised from 30 to 150 °C; the growth solution was heated from 30 °C and maintained at (b) 60, (c) 75 and (d) 90 °C, respectively. The small peaks at 1230 and 1410 nm are due to hydrocarbons present in the reaction solution. 

 

A = εCL
(1)where A is the absorbance, ε is the extinction coefficient per mole of nanoparticles, C is the molar concentration of nanoparticles, L is the path length of the radiation beam. As the ε at the 1st exciton peak of PbS QDs is proportional to r1.3 (r is the radius),27 the absorbance (height) at the 1st exciton peak will increase if the concentration remains constant. As a result, the decrease in the exciton peak means the concentration of the QDs decreases during the growth, which is consistent with the diffusion controlled growth; i.e. small particles dissolved and released monomers for the growth and size focusing39 of larger particles.34
In order to produce PbS QDs with narrow size distribution, we explored different synthetic parameters, including Pb to S ratio, concentration of Pb in the PbCl2 and OLA complex, heating rate and growth temperature. Among them, only growth temperature substantially affected the PbS growth, which is similar to previous PbCl2 based heat up synthesis.34Fig. 1b–d show the evolution of absorption spectra of PbS QDs when the growth solution was heated from 30 °C and maintained at 60, 75 and 90 °C, respectively. In all cases, the exciton peak became sharper, implying that size focusing occurred in the growth. The size distributions calculated from the absorption spectra demonstrated that the growth at 75 °C resulted in the best PbS QDs, as shown in Fig. 2a. The existence of an optimum growth temperature may be attributed to the balance between the diffusion coefficient and monomer oversaturation generated by the dissolution of small particles. In diffusion controlled growth, when small particles grow faster than larger ones, the size distribution decreases.39,40 Thus, the size distribution depends on the difference in the growth rate between small and large nanoparticles; i.e. a large difference leads to a narrow distribution, while a small difference results in a relatively broader distribution. The growth rate of a particle can be described by the equation given by Talapin:40 (2)where Vm is molar volume, D is the diffusion coefficient, C0flat is the solubility of the monomer in equilibrium with a flat interface, S describes the oversaturation, which is proportional to the amount of monomer remaining in the bulk solution relative to its equilibrium value, γ is the specific surface energy, R is the gas constant, T is temperature, r is the radius of a growing particle, kflatg is the growth rate constant for growth of a flat (r = ∞) surface, α is the transfer coefficient. Zhang et al.34 showed that a higher diffusion coefficient gives rise to a larger gradient in the growth rate curve. The diffusion coefficient in the PbCl2 and OLA complex strongly depends on temperature, i.e., the higher the temperature, the higher the diffusion coefficient.34 Therefore, a high temperature is preferred in terms of the diffusion coefficient. On the other hand, the size focusing needs a high oversaturation, which is supported by the dissolution of small particles; thus, the amount of dissolved particles determines the oversaturation. The growth or dissolution of a particle depends on its size and there is a critical size, given by the following:40 (3)
 Fig. 2  Evolution of size distribution (a) and particle concentration (b) when the growth solution was heated from 30 °C and maintained at 60, 75 and 90 °C, respectively. 
A nanoparticle having a radius smaller than rcr has a negative growth rate and will dissolve. As shown by eqn (3), the rcr is inversely proportional to temperature. A high temperature is detrimental if dissolution of a large amount of particles (for a high oversaturation) is needed. The evolution of particle concentration confirms fewer dissolved particles at 90 °C, compared to that at 75 °C, as shown in Fig. 2b. The smaller decrease rate of the particle concentration at 60 °C can be attributed to the low growth rate and smaller diffusion coefficient at a lower temperature. Fewer dissolved particles means fewer monomers are released, giving rise to a lower oversaturation, which is not beneficial to size focusing. Therefore, an optimum growth temperature exists in our synthesis, i.e. 75 °C. The PbS QDs synthesized at 75 °C have a size distribution of ∼9%, which is comparable to the values obtained by conventional hot injection36 and previous PbCl2 based heat up34 syntheses.
For large scale synthesis, we multiplied the amounts of reactants by 40, based on the regular synthesis at 75 °C and 18 g of PbS QDs were obtained from one batch of reaction (Fig. 3, right). Larger PbS QDs can be obtained via longer growth time and/or slightly higher growth temperatures (<90 °C). In spite of a large amount of QDs, the size distribution was retained, as demonstrated by the well defined exciton peak shown in Fig. 3 (left). As the lead precursor is in excess, the chemical yield was calculated based on the conversion of sulphur, which was estimated to be ∼80%. The high chemical yield is also important for low cost and large scale synthesis. Fig. 4 (left) shows a typical TEM image of the PbS QDs, confirming the narrow size distribution. The XRD pattern in Fig. 4 (right) matches well with the standard diffraction peaks, indicating the high crystallinity.

Similar to previous PbCl2 based synthesis, the PbS QDs here are also passivated with Cl−, with a Cl/Pb ratio of 0.43 that is consistent with previous results. Thanks to the hybrid passivation of Cl− and oleate, these PbS QDs exhibit a high PL QY of 42%. Additionally, they show superior stability, demonstrated by the unchanged absorption spectrum after storage in ambient conditions, with humidity of 60–80%, in powder form for 2 months (Fig. 3, left). The PL QY is almost maintained (38%) after 90 days of storage in air, and the PL spectra show negligible change (Fig. S3†), further demonstrating the excellent stability.
Conclusions
A simple heat up route to the low cost and large scale synthesis of PbS QDs was developed using TAA as the sulphur precursor. Absorption spectra of aliquots were used to monitor the QD growth, and quantitative calculation was performed based on the spectra to give the evolutions of size distribution and particle concentration. Among different sulphur precursors (TOPS, TBPS, sulphur powder and ammonium sulphide), TAA is low cost and has the appropriate reactivity. Monodisperse PbS QDs were obtained via size focusing in a diffusion controlled growth mode. An optimum growth temperature exists in the PbCl2 and TAA based synthesis due to the balance between diffusion coefficient and monomer oversaturation generated from dissolved small particles. A lower temperature leads to a higher viscosity of the growth solution, thus a smaller diffusion coefficient which is detrimental to size focusing. A higher temperature may result in a smaller critical size and fewer particles will dissolve, releasing fewer monomers, which is also detrimental to size focusing. As a heat up method, the synthesis was easily scaled up to produce 18 g of PbS QDs from one batch of reaction, with a high chemical yield of ∼80%. The as synthesized QDs were of high quality, exhibiting a high PL QY and excellent stability in air, due to the hybrid passivation of Cl− and oleate. The low cost and large scale synthesis of well passivated and stable PbS QDs will facilitate their more extensive applications and commercialization.

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  Evolutions of absorption spectra of PbS QDs synthesized under different conditions: (a) the temperature was raised from 30 to 150 °C; the growth solution was heated from 30 °C and maintained at (b) 60, (c) 75 and (d) 90 °C, respectively. The small peaks at 1230 and 1410 nm are due to hydrocarbons present in the reaction solution.
