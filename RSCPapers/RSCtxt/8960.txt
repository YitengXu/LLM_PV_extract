    , Accepted 19th January 2021First published on 19th January 2021AbstractInterface engineering has been demonstrated to have a great effect on designing high performance catalysts. In particular, the interface design at the atomic scale is always a fortress to be overcome by researchers. Herein, we in situ introduced triphenylphosphine into cobalt atom sites in a metal–organic framework via encapsulation and successfully synthesized a cobalt single-atom catalyst with a co-coordinated atomic interface structure of P and N (Co/Co1P1N3). Adopted as a counter electrode (CE) in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), Co/Co1P1N3 demonstrates a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 8.51%, outperforming Co/Co1N4 (6.62%) counter electrode and commercial Pt (7.88%). We discover that the electron donation from the P dopant can reduce the electrostatic attraction between Co and I− ions, which favor I− desorption processes, sequentially boosting the activity of Co/Co1P1N3.
Introduction
Energy issues are increasingly becoming a bottleneck that restricts social and economic development. Solar cells that directly convert light energy into electrical energy through the photoelectric effect or photochemical effect can alleviate the energy crisis to a certain extent and become a new driving force for economic development.1 Therefore, developing a cost-efficient solar energy conversion system is a hot topic in the recent years. Owing to the low cost, environmental friendliness, and high performance, the dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have been well studied since their first report in 1991.2 DSSCs are mainly composed of a nanoporous semiconductor film, dye sensitizer, redox electrolyte, counter electrode (CE), and conductive substrate. After a short period of more than ten years, research on dye-sensitized solar cells has made great progress in various aspects. As one crucial component in a typical DSSC device, CEs mainly perform two roles during the working state of the device: collection of the external circuit electrons and catalytic reduction of the redox couples in the electrolyte.3 Therefore, the ideal CE should have high conductivity, excellent catalytic activity, long-term stability, and high cost efficiency.4 Noble metal platinum (Pt) has been recognized as the best choice for decades due to its high catalytic activity.5 Regrettably, very few materials can compete with Pt as the CE of DSSCs despite numerous attempts.6 Therefore, searching for decent candidate CEs with good electrocatalytic activity and low cost is an important issue in CEs for DSSCs. Noble metal-free CEs have been investigated for many years.7 Among various candidates, transition metal cobalt-based CEs such as CoS, CoIn2S4, and CoSe have been reported as promising candidates to replace the conventional Pt.8 Co–N–C catalysts are also represented as good CEs for DSSCs, in which the photoelectronic properties can be greatly regulated by the atomic structure of the active site.9 Anchoring metal single-atom catalysts onto a desirable support have attracted widespread attention due to their high catalytic efficiency, resulting from the isolated active sites.10 For supported single metal atoms, the nitrogen doping on the carbon substrate can effectively anchor the single metal atom and improve their loading rate and stability, respectively. Studies have shown that the planar tetranitrogen-coordinated M–N4 part is a favorable catalytic site for single-atom catalysts. For its excellent catalytic activity, it has become a very promising alternative material for precious metals and metal oxides. Furthermore, some studies have also pointed out recently that the large electronegativity of the symmetric coordinated nitrogen atoms around the metal site will lead to the inappropriate free energy of adsorption of the intermediate product. Therefore, the introduction of phosphorus doping may induce a unique modification effect on the metal–nitrogen active site. Moreover, it is reported that the combination of heteroatoms and metals would induce charge redistribution, which can affect the electronegativity of the active site and the adsorption/desorption performance of the intermediate product. For example, Yuan et al. prepared nano-fibrous N, P heteroatom-doped carbon materials coated with MoP nanocrystals (MoP@NPCF/CC), which showed high OER catalytic performance in KOH.11
In this study, we adopted the Co/Co1P1N3 as the counter electrode material in a dye-sensitized solar cell. Co/Co1P1N3 was synthesized by the in situ confined phosphorization method with porous nanoscale metal–organic frameworks. Such Co/Co1P1N3 was successfully used as a platinum-free CE in the DSSC and exhibited excellent catalytic performance in the I3−/I− system. The resultant power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 8.51% was obtained by Co/Co1P1N3, which outperformed conventional platinum CE (7.88%).

Fig. 1a displays the synthetic procedure for Co/Co1P1N3. ZIF-67 was utilized as a precursor to encapsulate the triphenylphosphine (PPh3) molecule (Fig. S1, ESI†). With the pyrolysis treatment under N2 atmosphere at 900 °C, phosphorus was in situ doped on the product, forming phosphorus, nitrogen-rich carbon-coated cobalt nanoparticles (Co/Co1P1N3). Co/CoN4 was synthesized under the same conditions without triphenylphosphine (PPh3) molecules. Fig. S2 (ESI†) presents the morphology of the as-prepared PPh3@ZIF-67 that hardly displayed morphology difference in contrast with pure ZIF-67. The XRD patterns Fig. S3 (ESI†) demonstrated that PPh3@ZIF-67 displayed the structural feature of ZIF-67. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image in Fig. 1b and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image in Fig. 1c show the morphology of Co/Co1P1N3 with small nanoparticles within the frameworks. The high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) image (Fig. 1d) further authenticated it as a nanoparticle coated with porous graphitic shells. It also illustrates that the lattice spacing of 0.197 nm belongs to the face-centered cubic (fcc) phase of Co (JCPDS# 15-0806). The elemental mapping results (Fig. 1e, f and Fig. S4, S5, ESI†) displayed the uniform distributions of C, N, Co, and P elements over the entire framework. The energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy and inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) were used to detect the atom ratio of different elements in Co/Co1P1N3 composites.

A contrast sample of Co/Co1N4 (Fig. S6 and S7, ESI†) was also synthesized via the same procedure used to synthesize Co/Co1P1N3 except for adding PPh3. X-Ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of Co/Co1P1N3 (Fig. 1g) display a broad shoulder peak at around 20°, which is assigned to the (002) plane of graphitic carbon. A diffraction peak at 44° belonged to pure Co of Co/Co1P1N3. X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed to characterize the binding energies of Co, P, C, and N elements in Co/Co1P1N3 (Fig. S8–S11, ESI†). The PNC and NC samples were also prepared (Fig. S12–S16, ESI†).
To study the atomic interfacial structure and electronic structure of Co/Co1P1N3, the soft X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) was performed to detect C, N, and Co atoms. Fig. 2a shows the C K-edge spectrum of Co/Co1P1N3. The three distinct peaks at 285.6 eV (peak a), 288.5 eV (peak b), and 292.5 eV (peak c) are attributed to the dipole transition of the C 1s core electron into the π*CC, π*C–N/P, and σ*C–C antibonding orbitals, respectively.12 In particular, the emergence of peak b indicated that P atoms were successfully incorporated into the carbon matrix to form a C–N/P bond. Additionally, the N K-edge XANES spectrum of Co/Co1P1N3 (Fig. 2b) was also recorded to study the electronic state, in which the three main peaks d, e, and f represented pyridine nitrogen, pyrrole nitrogen, and graphitic nitrogen, respectively.13,14 The Co L-edge XANES spectra of Co/Co1P1N3 in Fig. 2c imply the possible formation of Co–Co, Co–P, and Co–N bonds.

(f) WT-EXAFS plots of Co/Co1P1N3 and reference samples, respectively. (g) The FT-EXAFS fitting curves of Co/Co1P1N3 sample at Co K-edge. (FT range: 2.0–11.8 Å−1; fitting range: 0.7–3.0 Å.) 
We further investigated the atomic structures and coordination conditions of separate samples by X-ray absorption near-edge structure and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS).15 The Co K-edge position of Co/Co1P1N3 was between those of Co foil and Co/Co1N4 (Fig. 2d). The FT-EXAFS results (Fig. 2e) show the Co–Co peak at 2.17 Å for the Co foil. The Co–N peak at 1.48 Å and the Co–Co peak at 2.15 Å belong to Co/Co1N4. The Co/Co1P1N3 shows a Co–P peak at 1.68 Å and a Co–Co peak at 2.29 Å. The wavelet transform (WT) of the Co K-edge EXAFS oscillation was performed to further prove the local coordination environment of the Co species in Co/Co1P1N3 (Fig. 2f). In the WT contour plot of the standard Co foil, the strongest peak at 6.8 Å−1 could be attributed to Co–Co, and the strongest one at 4.3 Å−1 in the WT contour plot of Co/Co1N4 corresponded to Co–N. By comparison, the only one intensity maximum at 4.7 Å−1 in the WT contour plot of Co/Co1P1N3 is ascribed to the Co–N/P bonding. Therefore, the results of FT-EXAFS and WT-EXAFS together ascertained the environment of the Co/Co1P1N3 atomic interface. The quantitative local structural parameters of Co atoms in Co/Co1P1N3, Co/Co1N4, and Co foils were finally obtained through the least-squares EXAFS fitting.16 The EXAFS fitting curves and the parameters are displayed in Fig. 2g, Fig. S17–S22 and Table S1 (ESI†). The Co/Co1P1N3 fitting results indicated that the cobalt particles were coated with a layer of P and N–cobalt-doped carbon matrix material loaded with isolated dispersed cobalt atoms, forming a plane four-coordinate structure with one P atom and three N atoms. The atomic distances are 2.18 Å (Co–P) and 1.86 Å (Co–N).
The schematic of the DSSC device is displayed in Fig. 3a, in which the deposited Co/Co1P1N3, Co/Co1N4, and other materials are utilized instead of common Pt nanoparticles on the fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass substrate to function as CEs. In addition, it also covers the basic components of the traditional nanostructured TiO2 photoanode, N719 dye, and the triiodide/iodide (I3−/I−) redox couple. Phosphorus-doped carbon–nitrogen frameworks (PNC) and carbon–nitrogen framework (NC) composites were synthesized as contrast CEs. The conventional Pt electrode was also used for comparison in experiments, in which Pt precursors were thermally decomposed on the FTO glass substrate at 350 °C. Subsequently, the basic performance of all CEs, including photocurrent density–voltage (J–V), power conversion efficiency (PCE), cyclic voltammetry (CV), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), were measured under the same conditions (please see the details in the ESI†).

(c) CV curves of conventional Pt, Co/Co1P1N3, Co/Co1N4, PNC, and NC CEs. (d) Epp and JRed1 values of conventional Pt, Co/Co1P1N3, Co/Co1N4, PNC, NC CEs obtained from the CV results. (e) Nyquist plots for symmetric cells fabricated with conventional Pt, Co/Co1P1N3, Co/Co1N4, PNC, and NC CEs, and the inset presents the equivalent circuit and zoom-in result of conventional Pt and Co/Co1P1N3 CEs. (f) Rct values of conventional Pt, Co/Co1P1N3, Co/Co1N4, PNC, NC CEs obtained from EIS results. 
The electrochemical properties and photovoltaic performance curves of different CEs are shown in Fig. 3b, and the corresponding data are summarized in Tables S2 and S3 (ESI†). The experimental data show that the short circuit photocurrent density (JSC) of the as-prepared Co/Co1P1N3, Co/Co1N4, and the traditional Pt CE mainly exhibit the following sequence of: Co/Co1P1N3 (16.53 mA cm−2) > Pt (15.62 mA cm−2) > Co/Co1N4 (13.07 mA cm−2) > PNC (11.73 mA cm−2) > NC (10.82 mA cm−2) (Fig. 3b). At this time, they all exhibited a very similar open circuit voltage (VOC) of about 0.72 V as well as a fill factor (FF) of around 70%. Therefore, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the as-prepared CEs follows the same sequence, and the PCE values of Co/Co1P1N3, Pt, Co/Co1N4, PNC, and NC CEs are 8.51%, 7.88%, 6.62%, 5.83%, and 5.23%, respectively (Illustration in Fig. 3b). It can be seen that under the same working condition of AM1.5G simulated sunlight (100 mW cm−2), Co/Co1P1N3 CE illustrates higher working efficiency than conventional Pt CE.
The significant difference in JSC values reflects numerous electrocatalytic activities of different CE for I3−/I− couples in the DSSC equipment. The CV measurement was performed to explore the reaction kinetics of Co/Co1P1N3 and other materials in a three-electrode system (Fig. 3c). Two pairs of redox peaks, Ox-1/Red-1 (at low potential) and Ox-2/Red-2 (at high potential), were observed on all CEs, corresponding to the following reaction equations: I3− + 2e− ↔ 3I−(1) 3I2 + 2e− ↔ 2I3−(2)
The similarity in the redox peak shapes of all the counter electrodes indicated the relatively similar electrochemical stability and catalytic activity during the catalytic reaction. The characteristic of reaction 1 is the key analysis object because the reduction of I3− to I− is the main reaction over CEs in DSSC. In general, the essential parameters to reflect the electrocatalytic activity of CE are the cathode/reduction peak current density (JRed-1) and peak-to-peak separation (Epp) between the first reduction peak (JRed-1) and the oxidation peak (JOx-1). The higher electrocatalytic activity presents a smaller Epp in addition to a larger JRed-1. The results in Fig. 3d show that Co/Co1P1N3 CE exhibits the highest electrocatalytic activity towards I3−/I−, and the remaining CE follows the same sequence as JSC: Co/Co1P1N3 > Pt > Co/Co1N4 > PNC > NC (Tables S2 and S3, ESI†).
Furthermore, a symmetrical battery constructed from two identical electrodes was assembled to detect the charge transfer capability between CE and electrolyte to clarify the origin of the electrocatalytic capability of different CEs. Fig. 3e shows the Nyquist plots of the corresponding symmetric battery with an electrochemical equivalent circuit obtained by the EIS measurement, including one big semicircle at the high frequency and one small semicircle at a low frequency. CPE and RS in the equivalent circuit illustration, respectively, represented the constant phase element and series resistance derived from high-frequency cutting on the real axis (Z′ axis) and almost the same for all CEs. In Fig. 3f, Rct represents the charge transfer resistance at the counter electrode/electrolyte interface. It can be seen that Rct follows the order of Co/Co1P1N3 (5.39 Ω cm2) < Pt (5.92 Ω cm2) < Co/Co1N4 (14.89 Ω cm2) < PNC (32.37 Ω cm2) < NC (43.23 Ω cm2). The minimum Rct of Co/Co1P1N3 CE facilitates the convenient charge transfer from the electrode surface to I3−, which may result in excellent catalytic activity.
The long-term stability of DSSC is one of the most important photoelectric parameters in addition to conversion efficiency. Since iodine (I3−/I−) ions in the electrolyte may poison the surface of Pt-based CEs and increase its Rct after long-term storage. The EIS measurements were implemented to explore the stability of CEs by comparing the Rct before and after CE immersed in the electrolyte for different periods of time. Fig. 4a shows the impedance spectrum of the fresh as well as aging virtual cells under ambient conditions. The impedance after 2–10 days of aging was compared, and the Rct of Co/Co1P1N3 only increased from 5.39 Ω cm2 to 5.68 Ω cm2, indicating good stability of Co/Co1P1N3 towards IRR. The in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) measurements for Co/Co1P1N3 were performed to directly monitor the atomic structures of Co under IRR electrocatalytic conditions, and the data were recorded on a setup equipped with a solid-state detector (Fig. 4b). The Co K-edge XAFS curves were collected at different potentials with no obvious changes in the in situ Co K-edge XANES spectra.

To investigate the mechanism of the electrocatalytic activity towards the reduction of I3−, DFT calculations of Co/Co1P1N3 and Co/Co1N4 were performed (Fig. 5 and Fig. S23, ESI†). Together with the EXAFS results (Fig. 2e), we built structures of Co/Co1P1N3 and Co/Co1N4, as shown in the insets of Fig. 5a. The simulated most stable structures of Co1N4–graphene have a Co–N bond length of 1.88 Å (Fig. S23 and Table S4, ESI†). After attaching to the Co (111) slab, the four Co–N bond lengths turn to 1.89 Å, 1.90 Å, 1.91 Å, and 1.91 Å, respectively, similar to the EXAFS result (Table S1, ESI†). When P is doped into the Co1N4 structure, a significant shape distortion occurred since P atoms are much larger than C or N atoms. It is also consistent with the EXAFS results, in which the large fitted-Debye–Waller factor indicates a significant disorder.

(c) Charge difference of I adsorbed on the Co/Co1P1N3 model.

Isosurfaces = 0.008. Green: a decrease in the charge density. Yellow: an increase in the charge density. 
IRR energy profiles on Co/Co1P1N3 and Co/Co1N4 are shown in Fig. 5a. The potential limiting step (PLS) of IRR electrochemical steps on Co/Co1N4 is the final iodine desorption, with a desorption free energy change of ΔG = 0.25 eV. It corresponds to an overpotential of η = 0.25 V + E0 = 0.79 V vs. SHE. However, after P doping, PLS is not the final iodine desorption anymore. The overpotential η of step (iii) for Co/Co1P1N3 is η = 0.05 V + E0 = 0.59 V vs. SHE, which is much smaller than that of Co/Co1N4 (0.79 V), illustrating better catalytic property towards IRR of Co/Co1P1N3 than towards Co/Co1N4.
To further investigate the mechanism of iodine adsorption, the electronic structure of the adsorbed state of iodine was analyzed. The electron localization function (ELF) plot (Fig. 5b) indicated that the interaction between I atom and Co atom consisted of both covalent bonding and electrostatic force, while electrostatic force made the most contribution. The charge difference (Fig. 5c) indicated charge transfer from Co to I. Thus, I was partially negatively charged, and Co was partially positively charged. The electrostatic interaction between Co and I atoms made the most contribution to the adsorption strength. The Bader charge (Table S4, ESI†) of the active Co atoms in Co/Co1N4 is +0.93. P doping can significantly influence the charge state of Co. Several P doping models were simulated with DFT (Fig. S23, ESI†), among which only when one P atom replaced one of the four N atom (Table S4, ESI†), the positive charge of active Co reduced (Model 5 and 6). The electronegativity of P is less than that of C and N, and as a result, the P atom in the carbon group works as an electron donor, which decreased the Bader charge of Co (Table S4, ESI†). With the decrease in the Bader charge of Co, the electrostatic force between Co and I decreased, and the adsorption of I weakened. Thus, P doping in the carbon layer promotes the desorption of I−.
Notably, this result was reasonable under an assumption that there was a voltage (U = E0 = 0.54 V vs. SHE) to balance the chemical potential of I− and 1/2I(g) + e− in a standard condition when the working electrode was catalyzing the reaction. The overpotentials measured under real experimental conditions may be under a different benchmark. However, a qualitative conclusion could be made that the catalyzer with additional Co–P coordination promotes the catalytic activity.
Conclusions
In summary, Co/Co1P1N3 has been synthesized by an in situ confined phosphorization method with porous nanoscale metal–organic frameworks. Notably, Co/Co1P1N3 outperforms Co/Co1N4, PNC, NC, and conventional Pt in PCE when used as the CEs of DSSCs. In addition, Co/Co1P1N3 also displayed good stability under IRR conditions. Both theoretical simulations and experimental results revealed that the enhanced catalytic properties for the IRR of Co/Co1P1N3 in contrast with Co/Co1N4 was attributed to the P-doped atomic structure of the active site. Due to the improved power conversion property and the reduced cost, the MOF-derived catalysts with new synthesis strategy as CEs may give an excellent opportunity to the development of high-performance solar cells.
