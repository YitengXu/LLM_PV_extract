Results show that the GWPs associated with the production of hydrogen by steam reforming in a 100 years time frame are 9.71 and 9.46 kg CO2-equivalent/kg H2 for natural gas and naphtha, respectively. For vegetable oils, the GWP decreases to 6.42 kg CO2-equivalent/kg H2 for rapeseed oil, 4.32 for palm oil and 3.30 for soybean oil. A dominance analysis determined that the part of the process that has the largest effect on the GWP is the steam reforming reaction itself for the fossil fuel-based systems, which accounts for 56.7% and 74% of the total GWP for natural gas and naphtha, respectively. This contribution is zero for vegetable oil-based systems, for which harvesting and oil production are the main sources of CO2-eq emissions.Green ContextThe so-called hydrogen economy is becoming a dominant topic, with much impetus being behind a drive to move towards a hydrogen-based energy production. This paper describes the impact of this switch in terms of the impact of producing hydrogen from various sources, including petrochemical feedstocks and biomass. The biomass systems have considerably lower global warming potentials compared to the petrochemical based routes, for which the steam reforming process is a major burden. Within the biomass alternatives, considerable variations exist, the reasons for which are discussed.DJMIntroductionThe potential of hydrogen as a clean fuel and energy carrier has made sustainable energy systems based on hydrogen a real possibility in the mid-term future, mainly if it is used with natural gas in conventional engines, and fuel cell systems are implemented at a latter stage.1 Although the environmental advantages of hydrogen over fossil fuels are unquestionable when considered at a local level, the disadvantages may outweigh the benefits when considered on a global level, if hydrogen is produced by current methods. Hydrogen is produced on an industrial scale from natural gas, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and naphtha by catalytic steam reforming, and from heavy oil fractions by partial oxidation.2 Both processes are well established, but the former is the most economical for large-scale hydrogen production.3 Large amounts of carbon dioxide are generated when hydrogen is produced by steam reforming of hydrocarbons, both as a reaction byproduct and in the flue gas of the reformer furnace. The environmental benefits of a hydrogen-based energy system may therefore be questionable if the demand for hydrogen has to be covered by intensive use of fossil resources through steam reforming, which is clearly a net contributor to carbon dioxide emissions. Depending on the efficiencies of the production, distribution and use of hydrogen, the hydrogen-based scenario may even be less favorable environmentally than the direct use of fossil fuels.We believe that the true potential of a hydrogen-based energy system may only be achieved if hydrogen is made available from renewable resources. A promising way to produce renewable hydrogen is to use liquid biofuels as feedstocks for the steam reforming process, especially for small-scale reforming for distributed energy generation systems based on fuel cells. Ethanol has been considered by several researchers for hydrogen production.4 Ethanol steam reforming has been studied with different catalysts prepared from Cu, Ni, Zn and Rh on alumina. One of the main applications is the use of ethanol as a fuel for molten carbonate5–7 and polymer electrolyte8 fuel cells. The production of hydrogen by steam-reforming of biomass fast-pyrolysis oil (bio-oil) has been shown to be feasible, and laboratory studies on the reforming of bio-oil fractions and model compounds have concluded that they can be effectively converted to hydrogen using commercial catalysts and technology for the steam reforming of naphtha.9–13 Recently we focused on vegetable oils, which are a particular form of biomass that has already attracted considerable interest as renewable feedstock for the production of liquid fuels (bio-diesel)14–18 and chemicals.19–21 Due to their very low oxygen content and high hydrogen to carbon ratio, which is close to that of naphtha, vegetable oils have stoichiometric hydrogen yields that are significantly higher than those of bio-oil, which is formed by a mixture of highly oxygenated compounds. In a laboratory study using a commercial nickel-based catalyst, we have established that vegetable oils are effectively converted to hydrogen with technology that at present is used for the steam reforming of liquid hydrocarbons.22–24In this paper we report a quantitative analysis of the environmental load, and of CO2 emissions and the global warming potential (GWP), associated to the production of hydrogen by steam reforming several feedstocks. Two fossil fuels, methane and naphtha, are compared with three vegetable oils, rapeseed oil, soybean oil and palm oil. The case studied focuses on a steam-reforming plant with 50000 Nm3 h−1 of hydrogen located on the Mediterranean coast of Spain, and includes feedstock production in several areas of the world and transportation to the reforming plant. We also conducted a dominance analysis to determine which parts of the process have the largest effects on the results.Results and discussionThe results of the LCI analysis are presented in Table 1. The table shows the figures for the most important resources consumed and emissions released by the system for the five feeds, three biomass feedstocks and two fossil fuels that are studied. Air and water emissions are expressed per kg of hydrogen produced, the resource consumption is in kg, and the total primary energy in MJ, also in terms of kg of hydrogen.

The CO2 generated when vegetable oils are steam reformed comes from biomass, and the CO2 sequestered in the biomass is carried through the LCA as CO2 (biomass) versus CO2 (fossil), which results from combustion or decomposition of fossil sources. The net CO2 emission from the biomass in the system is assumed to be zero: CO2 generated by steam reforming vegetable oils is assumed to be offset by the uptake of CO2 during biomass growth. Plants use solar energy to fix carbon from carbon dioxide during photosynthesis. It is assumed that the CO2 taken up by the biomass will be released back to the environment through the decomposition of plant residue left in the field after harvesting, or in the H2-production process. Thus the net CO2 balance for growing and disposal of biomass is zero. Therefore, the CO2 (biomass) results are not included in the impact assessment phase for calculating greenhouse gas potential.Systems based on fossil fuels emit 7.58 kg of CO2 per kg of H2, when the feed is natural gas and 9.40 kg of CO2 per kg of H2 when the feed is naphtha. Biomass-based scenarios have significantly lower CO2 emissions: 1.94 kg, 3.14 kg, and 2.61 kg, for rapeseed, soybean, and palm oil, respectively. This results in average savings of CO2 emissions of 70% between both scenarios. For fossil fuels, approximately 72–74% of the carbon dioxide comes from the SR process, while plant operation (i.e., natural gas combustion and water treatment) is the main source (60–90%) of CO2 emissions for vegetable oil-based systems. Although very different models for feed transport were assumed for each system, this stage does not make an important contribution to the net CO2 emissions. The lowest and highest limits for the contribution of transportation correspond to rapeseed oil and palm oil, which emit 97 g and 370 g of carbon dioxide when the amount of feed needed to produce 1 kg of H2 is transported to the plant. This is 5% and 16% of the total CO2 emissions for each system, respectively.Besides CO2, other major air emissions from the systems include particulates, CO, CH4, SOx, NOx, N2O, non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHCs), and hydrogen chloride (HCl). Very few emissions, other than CO2, come from the SR process itself. For all five cases studied, most particulates (>89%) come from the water-treatment process. Carbon monoxide emissions are primarily a result of raw material transport and are four times larger when H2 is produced from palm oil or soybean oil rather than from the other feeds, since these substrates are assumed to be transported very long distances. Methane is emitted in considerable amounts by two of the five options. The natural gas-based reformer releases 86 g of methane per kg of hydrogen, with 93% of this amount originated from fugitive losses. The palm oil-based reformer releases 69 g of CH4 per kg of hydrogen, 91% of which comes from the production of the palm oil. None of the other feeds surpasses 7 g of net CH4 emissions per kg of hydrogen. Nitrous oxide emissions are strictly related to the production of vegetable oils. Only the rapeseed oil-based case shows significant N2O emissions (250 times the amount for soybean oil), which is caused by the extensive use of fertilizers during plant growing.Resource consumption and water emissionsCoal, natural gas, and oil (in ground) were chosen as the flows in the environmental inventory which indicate the depletion of natural resources. The total primary energy, calculated from the values of these flows and expressed in MJ (Table 1), shows that fossil fuel-based systems consume approximately three times more energy from natural resources than vegetable-oil based systems. This is due to the direct use of natural gas or naphtha as process feeds.With regard to water emissions, the total number of water pollutants was smaller than other emissions. There was no significant difference in the amount of each pollutant between feeds, except for COD (chemical oxygen demand), which was two orders of magnitude higher for vegetable oils than for natural gas or naphtha. COD is associated with eutrophication potential impact, and more than 99% of water emissions are related to the production of vegetable oils. The largest value is for palm oil, which emits 4.5 g of COD per kg of hydrogen. If COD is transformed into CO2 through subsequent water treatment processes, an extra of 6.2 g of CO2 are released into the atmosphere. Although not significant in comparison to the main carbon dioxide emission sources in the process, it should be added to the total emissions of carbon dioxide.Greenhouse gases and global warming potentialThe total amount of greenhouse gases has to be quantified if the GWP of each system is to be evaluated. Although CO2 is the most important greenhouse gas and is the main emission for all the systems, the GWP is a combination of CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions, as mentioned above. The GWP, as well as the contribution of each greenhouse gas, is shown in Table 2, for a 20, 100, and 500-year time frame. If the capacity of each gas to contribute to the warming of the atmosphere is taken into account, the GWP of a system can be normalized to CO2-equivalence and its overall contribution to global climate change described. It is clear from this table that CO2 is the main contributor in all the systems, except for rapeseed oil and palm oil, for which feed production generates large quantities of N2O and CH4, respectively. Although CH4 and N2O emissions are considerably lower than CO2 emissions on a mass basis (1.94 kg of CO2/kg of H2versus 14 g of N2O/kg of H2 for rapeseed oil, and 2.61 kg of CO2/kg of H2versus 69 g of CH4/kg of H2 for palm oil) both gases contribute significantly to the global GWP due to their high individual GWPs. The general trend is that biomass-based systems have significantly lower GWP than systems based on fossil fuels. Data in Table 2 also show how GPW decreases as the time frame increases. This trend is more acute for those systems whose GPW depends mainly on N2O and/or CH4. For a 100-year period, a typical frame in LCA, both natural gas and naphtha-based systems have a GPW around 9.50–9.70 kg CO2-eq/kg H2. This is in good agreement with previous studies.25 In the same time frame, biomass-based systems have GWPs of 6.40, 3.30, and 4.30 kg CO2-eq/kg H2 for rapeseed oil, soybean oil, and palm oil, respectively. In terms of GWP, soybean oil is the best feedstock for producing hydrogen by steam reforming of vegetable oils, since it decreases the GWP by 65% in comparison to fossil fuels. Palm oil and rapeseed oil only allow GWP reductions of 55% and 33%, respectively.

The process was divided into its 5 main steps, each of which was then analyzed for a 100-year time frame. For natural gas, the SR process accounts for 56.7% of the greenhouse gas emissions, while these emissions are zero when the source is a biomass-derived substrate like vegetable oils. For soybean oil, most emissions come primarily from the operation of the reforming plant (fuel combustion and water treatment), and account for 55% of the overall GWP. For the natural gas-based system, however, plant operation (including natural gas losses) generates 3.59 kg of CO2-eq/kg of H2, that is 37.0% of the total CO2-eq emissions. The feed production stage in the natural gas-based case emits 0.31 kg of CO2-eq/kg of H2 (3.1% of total GWP), while the CO2-eq emissions during the production of soybean oil are around four times greater, that is 1.16 kg of CO2-eq/kg of H2 (35.1% of total GWP of this system). The contribution of feed transport to the total GWP is similar for natural gas and soybean oil. Transport of natural gas over a 2000 km of gas pipelines emits 0.25 kg of CO2-eq/kg of H2 (2.6% of total GWP), while the transport of soybean oil emits 0.19 kg of CO2-eq/kg of H2 (7.9% of total GWP). In both systems the generation of electricity accounts for less than 2% of the GWP. Finally, other parts of the process like plant construction, and decommissioning and construction of pipelines, were neglected in the life cycle analysis because of the low emissions of greenhouse gases. Their contribution to overall GWP is as low as 0.3% of the total amount.25

Steam reforming is a very mature technology, and changes in plant design or catalysts are not expected to improve yields, although minor changes in the process and catalysts may be needed to operate satisfactorily with vegetable oils. However, the use of biomass-derived fuels to provide heat in the furnace, instead of burning natural gas, appears to be one way of reducing CO2 emissions. Regarding the choice of the vegetable oil to be used as feed, it seems extremely important to select one which minimizes N2O and CH4 emissions during the crop growing or the oil production steps. Legumes like soybeans fix nitrogen more easily than other crops, leading to less fertilizer demand and lower N2O emissions. Besides, crops that need considerable amounts of fertilizers may overbalance the environmental advantages.Limitations of the studyIn addition to the many assumptions stated, the results presented in this study are based on secondary data, i.e. data obtained from published sources such as databases, industry or government publications, journals, or books. Consequently, the level of reliability depends on the information used, and although these circumstances are not enough to change the global tendency of the results, the absolute values may of course differ from real situations.FundamentalsLife cycle assessment (LCA) overviewAccording to the United Nations Environmental Program,26 life cycle assessment is the process of evaluating the effects that a product, service or activity has on the environment throughout its life cycle, commonly referred to as ‘cradle-to-grave’. In the case of a product, the life cycle starts when the raw material is extracted and then includes the manufacture of intermediate products, their transportation, distribution, and utilization and their final disposal, which often refer to multiple parallel paths such as recycling, incineration, or landfill. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) has been developed as a systematic tool to determine the impact that a product has on the environment throughout its life cycle. LCA is used to comprehensively quantify and interpret the flows to and from the environment and it is based on a balance of the inputs (consumption of raw material and energy) and the outputs (emissions and wastes as well as co-products) of the system considered. The ISO standards 14040 to 14043 outline the different phases of an LCA. According to the ISO 14000 series, an LCA involves the following steps:(1) the definition of the goal and the scope of the study.(2) the inventory, in which the inputs and outputs from a life cycle are calculated and tabulated.(3) the life cycle impact assessment, in which the inventory data are associated with specific environmental impacts. These are evaluated and quantified.(4) the interpretation, which describes the implications to decision makers.LCA can serve to identify and quantify those aspects of a process or product that generate significant environmental burdens. Moreover, as used in the present work, it is extremely useful for comparing two or more processes that produce a common material or utility, in terms of environmental impacts.Functional unit and system boundariesThe functional unit, also known as the production amount, is the basis of the analysis and was chosen to be one kilogram of hydrogen produced. The system to be analyzed here and its boundaries when the feed is rapeseed oil are presented in Fig. 1. The study accounts for the production of the feedstocks, their transport to the plant and the steam-reforming process, including the life cycles of other main material and energy inflows. As the use and the end of life phases are not included, this is a so-called ‘cradle-to-gate’ study. This is justifiable because the use and end of life phases are identical for the product hydrogen. Only the feed options and their processing are different and that is why we compared them. Fig. 1  System (steam reforming of rapeseed oil) and its boundaries. Software and dataThe LCA software package used to track the material, and the energy inputs and outputs between the process blocks within the system was Tools for Environmental Analysis and Management (TEAM), by Ecobilan, Inc. The life cycle inventory data for the following process blocks were available in the TEAM database, known as Data for Environmental Analysis and Management (DEAM):• Combustion of natural gas• Production of electricity (Europe)• Production of softened water• Sea transport (tanker)• Rail transport (european average)• Road transport (truck 16t)• Production of heavy fuel oil• Production of diesel oilThe data sources for DEAM were APME, ETH Zurich and BUWAL 250 and 232. The inventory data for processes within the system that were not available in DEAM or that we preferred to be taken from exactly known sources were entered manually into TEAM. Data for the following process blocks were obtained from the cited literature:• Natural gas production, Algeria27• Naphta production, South European situation28• Rapeseed oil production29• Palm oil production30• Soybean oil production31• Gas transport by pipeline from Algeria27The analysis performed does not account for the catalysts or the monoethanolamine used in the CO2 removal plant, since they have a minor incidence on the total balance.25 Furthermore, these contributions are common for all the feedstocks studied here.Steam-reforming plant and utility balanceThe feed used at present for the industrial steam reforming process is normally natural gas, but other hydrocarbons such as naphtha or LPG are also used. Hydrogen can also be obtained by steam reforming of vegetable oils.22 Although the feasibility of using this substrate as feed for the process is still being studied, results from laboratory studies indicate that vegetable oils may be converted with existing catalysts and technology for naphtha reforming.The basic steps in a conventional steam-reforming plant are the reformer, the shift converter and the purification unit. First, a synthesis gas is generated by steam reforming the organic feed, then supplementary hydrogen is generated by reacting the synthesis gas in one or more shift converters and, finally, the gas is purified by removing carbon dioxide, methanating the remaining carbon oxides, and cooling. The steam-reforming process presented here is based mainly on the data and descriptions contained in the literature.2,32,33Fig. 2 shows a flowsheet of a conventional steam-reforming process. The main stages in the process are as follows: (a) Reforming. After being desulfurized and purified, the feed is mixed with superheated steam over a nickel-based catalyst in the reformer. The strongly endothermic reaction occurs at temperatures above 550 °C and the process heat is supplied by radiant combustion of natural gas fuel. The steam-reforming reaction of an oxygenated feed (CnHmOk) is the following: CnHmOk + (n
−
k) H2O →
n CO + (n + m/2 −
k) H2(1) (b) High and low-temperature shift. After the reformer, the process gas mixture contains CO and H2 and it passes through a heat recovery step and is fed into a water gas shift reactor to produce additional H2. Normally two stages of conversion (high temperature and low temperature) are used to reduce the CO content to a concentration of approximately 0.2–0.4 in volume percentage. This exothermic reaction occurs at temperatures ranging from 200 to 400 °C over copper–zinc and iron oxide catalysts. CO + H2O → CO2 + H2(2) (c) Carbon dioxide removal. The major diluent, CO2, is removed in a scrubbing unit by means of the monoethanolamine process. The final CO2 content of the product is approximately 0.1% in weight. Other processes for CO2 removal such as pressure swing adsorption (PSA) are also available. (d) Methanation. The residual CO and CO2 in the H2 stream after the CO2 is removed is further converted to CH4 by a methanation reaction: CO + 3 H2
→ CH4 + H2O(3) (e) Cooling. The hot product gas is cooled to 25 °C with cooling water. Water is separated and the product, containing 97–98% H2 in weight, exits at 25 °C and 2.4 MPa. The main impurity of the product is methane. Fig. 2  Diagram of the steam-reforming process. The main overall chemical reaction for the steam reforming of an organic compound can be obtained by adding the reforming and shift reactions as follows. CnHmOk + (2n

Methane (CH4) and naphtha (C7H16) are the two hydrocarbons that are most widely used as feedstocks to produce hydrogen by steam reforming, while rapeseed oil (C24.4H37.6O2), soybean oil (C17.8H33O2), and palm oil (C16.9H35O2) are the alternative feeds which are proposed to produce hydrogen via a sustainable path. For each feed, a global balance of the SR plant has been performed with the following assumptions:• The steam-to-carbon ratio at the reformer entrance was set at the typical value of 6.• The final product at the exit of the plant was pure hydrogen. A typical hydrogen concentration of 97% in weight is obtained.• For simplicity in hydrogen-yield calculation, natural gas was considered as pure methane and the desulfuration unit required for natural gas and naphtha was not accounted for in the balances.• The combustion of natural gas (fuel) to supply the energy requirements of the plant, took place in an excess of 40% air. The amount of fuel required to provide the heat duty to produce 1 kg of product was the same for all the feeds, and equivalent to 20% of the natural gas used as feed. This value, based on the literature,34,35 was chosen with conservative criteria.• No co-product credit was allocated for the export steam.

There is a natural gas loss of 4% in the total cradle-to-gate analysis for hydrogen,25i.e. about 40 g of methane is liberated per kg of natural gas. Naphtha losses were calculated in a similar manner. Around 12% of the total natural gas losses are due to fugitive emissions from processing. Thus, assuming the same rate of losses for naphtha processing, we considered the naphtha emissions to be 5 g of unspecified hydrocarbons per kg of naphtha.Inventory data for feeds and transport processesThe inventory data used for the different fossil and biomass-derived feeds are presented in Table 5. Fig. 3 shows a general overview of the production steps for these feeds. The following section outlines the assumptions made in the literature for obtaining the inventory data of each feed.

Natural gas. The life cycle inventory data of the Algerian natural gas have been used for natural gas production. These data include the exploration, extraction and processing of the natural gas. The drilling statistics on boring show that around 30% of the drill tests are successful, as the specific drill capacity 3.2 × 10−6 m m−3 is taken into account. The main air emissions of the extraction are the emissions from the torches as well as the gas emissions due to losses, ventilation and repairs. The emissions of the process to water and soil are mining waters, soil pollution by lubricating oils, fats or detergents (often dispersed through rain water) and emissions by the further treatment of the drilling sludge. The processing consists of drying and separating higher hydrocarbons. The most common drying process is the glycol-based adsorption process. The higher hydrocarbons are considered to be separated by a modern technology based on electricity.27 The natural gas is assumed to be transported for an average of 2000 km through pipelines from Algeria to the South European Mediterranean coast. Natural gas is almost exclusively transported in pipelines that are powered by compressors with gas turbines. The average pipeline has been assumed to have a lifetime of 50 years.27Naphtha. The main output from refineries is the naphtha fraction, which is used for petrochemical products. However, a number of cracker operators also take in a variety of other hydrocarbon products from refineries. Since the inputs and outputs of refineries are partitioned over all usable products, the term ‘refined products’ has been used as the functional unit rather than naphtha, since they all have the same input and output characteristics. The inventory data that we chose correspond to the average gross inputs and outputs associated with the production of one kilogram of refinery products for the average south European case, in which all crude oil is derived from sources other than the North Sea.28 Naphtha production depends on the transport of the crude oil from the extraction site to the refinery. As it has been considered that all crude oil is derived from sources other than the North Sea, an average transport of 15000 km in overseas tankers has been taken into account; 36% of the crude oil is imported from Africa to South Europe, 12% from Eastern Europe, 44% from the Middle East and only 8% from the Western hemisphere.28Rapeseed oil. The inventory data for the production of rapeseed oil assumes that energy carriers are consumed as well as mineral sources, with the related airborne emissions. Co-products have been taken into account as benefits. For the farming of rapeseed, the standard German situation has been taken as the basis. In conventional agriculture, synthetic pesticides and a huge amount of mineral fertilizer are used. The analysis used has assumed an average yield of 3.1 tons of rapeseed per ha. The main operations assessed in the balance have been plowing, sowing, fertilizer and pesticide application, mowing and harrowing the rape stubbles. Except for the emissions from the production and application of the fertilizer, N2O and NH3 emissions are generated by nitrification and denitrification processes. The type of agricultural land used as reference is actively planted fallow land, which requires such basic operations as cultivation engineering, sowing and moving. The emissions and consumption of resources in the production of the seed have also been taken into account. Rapeseed oil is assumed to be produced in decentralized, small enterprises. First the rapeseed is cleaned and dried, and then it is separated in a ratio of 1∶2 from the colza cake which is used as fodder. It is refined by sedimentation and filtration, and sold. In the whole balance, two co-product credits have been allocated: (1) for the use of the land as actively planted fallow land and (2) for the substitution of soy coarse meal by the co-product colza cake. For the allocation, the average protein content has been taken as the basis. The production of soy includes the cultivation of the beans, the fabrication of coarse meal with soy oil as co-product and both transatlantic and continental transport by ship, The origin is assumed to be the U.S.29 It has also been assumed that the rapeseed oil is produced in the agricultural regions themselves, and that it is transported in small trucks to logistic centers, which send parts to the steam reforming process plant by train. Hence, of a total transport distance of 240 km, we have taken into account the following assumptions for rapeseed oil transport: 140 km of road transport in a 16t truck and 100 km of average European rail transport. 29 The truck transport requires diesel oil as a particular life cycle data input.Soybean oil. The inventory data for soybean oil have been extracted from a study on biodiesel production in the U.S. The analysis includes the agricultural part, transport to the crusher, and the crushing, and is based on data from soybean farms of the major producing states of the country. Potassium, phosphate and phosphorous fertilizers, and agrochemicals are used to replace minerals in the soil, but only small amounts of nitrogen fertilizer are required by the soybean plant. It is assumed that most of the soybeans that are moved 120 km from field to crusher are transported by heavy-duty trucks. The energy emissions resulting from loading and unloading the soybeans are also included. The model of the soybean crushing process is based, as a starting point, on a typical production unit located in the southeastern region of the United States. This corresponds to a production of almost 400 metric tons/day of crude, degummed soybean oil, obtained from 95000 kg h−1 of soybeans (or 2273 metric tons/day). The facility uses solvent extraction to recover the oil. The beans are prepared by removing their hulls, grinding and flaking. The flaked beans are then subjected to an extraction step in which hexane is used to remove the soybean oil. The extracted beans are dried and ground to produce a marketable meal product. Oil-containing hexane is then processed to separate the volatile hexane phase from the oil. The hexane solvent is recovered and recycled as much as possible. Finally, the oil product is washed with water to remove gums before it is stored or shipped. The shipping of meal is not included in the LCI. An allocation technique based on the mass output of soybean crushing is used as the baseline for this study (soybean oil 18% and soybean meal 82%, by weight).31 It is assumed that soybean oil going from US to Europe travels 10000 km by sea.29Palm oil. A palm tree bears its first fruits between the ages of 30 and 36 months, and may produce a harvest every 10 to 21 days throughout its productive life, which lasts 20 to 25 years. Our analysis used data from Malaysia, and it has been assumed that fresh fruit bunches are produced on plantations of approximately 135 trees per ha, yielding a production rate of 18000 kg ha−1. The fresh fruit bunches are harvested manually and taken by wheelbarrows or diesel tractor to the plantation’s access roads, where they are loaded in trucks or trailers for shipment to the palm mill. For this agriculture step, it has also been assumed that the replanted area represents 0.4% of the total planted area per year and that over-aged palm trees are burned. It has been also assumed that the total fertilizer requirements are purchased fertilizer, plus the additional fertilizer value of land-applied palm oil mill effluent, empty fruit bunches and other organic sources. Furthermore, the inventory data include diesel fuel for tractors, heavy equipment for infrastructure and fuel for irrigation and drainage pumps. In the palm oil mill, the fruit brunches are sent to a stripper where the fruitlets are separated from the rest. This results in empty fruit branches that have been assumed to be applied directly to the plantation soil as fertilizer substitute. The amount of fertilizer displaced by the application of empty fruit branches is used to allocate co-product credit. Nearly the same proportions of empty fruit branches and crude palm oil are produced. The crude palm oil is a mixture of oil, water and fruit solids, which is clarified in a continuous centrifugal settling tank operation. The anaerobic digestion of palm oil mill effluents produces biogas that can be collected and burned to produce energy, for which co-product credit has also been allocated. Nevertheless, this anaerobic process is responsible for methane emissions. The remaining solids are dried and applied also as a substitute for fertilizer in the palm plantations. Later on, the fiber is separated from the nut and the shell is split from the kernel. The fiber and the shells are used as fuel for the mill. Excess shells are used as a base or surface material on the numerous roads of the plantation. Co-product allocation has been applied for the shell material used in road construction.30 The transport of the palm oil from Malaysia to Southern Europe has been taken into account assuming an overseas transport of 20000 km. This transport process requires the special consumption of the life cycle inventory data of heavy fuel oil.Impact assessment with global warming potentialThe environmental loads taken into account in this study are coal, natural gas, oil and total primary energy for the resources; the air emissions are carbon dioxide (fossil), carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons (except methane), hydrogen chloride, methane, nitrogen oxides, nitrous oxide, particulates (unspecified), and sulfur oxides; and the water emissions are acids, chemical oxygen demand and oils (unspecified). Specific organic compounds are not considered because they were not balanced in the literature which was the source of the environmental loads of the feeds.The main focus of this study is to compare the CO2 emissions of various feedstocks which use steam reforming technology to produce hydrogen. Nevertheless, other contributors to global warming, such as methane and nitrous oxide, must be taken into account when the impact of the process is analyzed. To account for these contributors, we used the method for quantitatively evaluating potential man-made contributions to global warming from emissions occurring during the life cycle of a product.36 Potential contributors to global warming are defined as substances which (1) absorb infrared radiation and have an atmospheric lifetime which is sufficient to make a significant contribution to warming or (2) have a petrochemical origin and are degraded with release of CO2. For direct emissions of CO2 which result in a net contribution to the atmospheric content, only fossil CO2 has to be considered. To determine the potential contribution to global warming for a given substance other than carbon dioxide, the Global Warming Potential (GWP) is defined. The emissions for the substance are expressed as emissions which are equivalent to the reference substance carbon dioxide (CO2). In practice, precise calculations of the cumulative contribution to warming require computer models that take into account the chemical composition of the atmosphere.37 The GWP for a greenhouse gas (i) is thus calculated as the contribution to warming for a given quantity (weight) of gas (i) divided by the contribution to warming for a corresponding quantity of CO2. The formula for the equivalence factor of gas (i) is: (5) where:• ai is the gas’s specific IR absorption coefficient, its instantaneous radiative forcing, assuming that the composition of the atmosphere remains the same (unit Wm−2 ppm−1),• ci(t) is the time-dependent residual concentration of gas (i) deriving from the pulse-emission in question in 1986 (unit ppm),• aCO2 and cCO2(t) are the magnitudes of the corresponding emission of CO2.Eqn. (5) expresses the contribution to warming over the time of integration for a defined emission scenario for gas (i). A frequently used scenario is a momentary emission of 1 Gt of the gas in question in 1986. Otherwise, the composition of the atmosphere is assumed to be constant. The contribution to warming is integrated over the chosen time T and divided by the contribution to warming from 1 Gt of CO2 emitted in the same manner.38 The length ‘T’ of the time interval over which the substance’s warming effect is integrated is of significance for how the GWP weights the relative effects of the various greenhouse gases. A small T value (10–50 years) will weight the short-lived gases relatively more heavily, while a large T value (200–1000 years) will assign greater weight to the long-lived greenhouse gases. From the expression for GWP it follows that the choice of ‘T’ is of greatest significance for those substances whose atmospheric lifetimes deviate significantly from the lifetime of CO2, which is not well defined. The residual quantity rapidly decays to about 40% over the first 50 years, followed by a slow decline over the next several hundred years.36 The choice of the time interval ‘T’ is determined by the climatic effects to be assessed. The temperature of the continents is thus expected to reach equilibrium with the atmospheric temperature relatively quickly. To solve the problem of choosing ‘T’, several decades have been proposed as a suitable period of time. By comparison, the warming of the world’s oceans will require several centuries to reach equilibrium.39 Using the best estimates of IR absorption half-lives for the individual greenhouse gases, the International Panel of Climate Change (IPCC) has calculated GWP values which express the direct contribution of a substance to man-made global warming for 20, 100 and 500 years. The values used in this study are given in Table 6 (the GWP value for methane represents the sum of direct and indirect contributions).

In this way, the effect that each part of the process had on the total emissions was determined and the most significant parts identified. The global process analyzed here was divided into five categories or sub-processes: (1) feed, the environmental loads of the raw material, (2) transport, the displacement of the feed from its starting point to the Mediterranean coast of Spain, (3) process, the steam reforming reaction itself, (4) plant operation, the combustion of natural gas, the gas losses due to fugitive emissions, and the treatment (softening) of the water consumed in the SR reaction, and finally, (5) electricity and others.ConclusionsThe LCA analysis that we have carried out for the production of hydrogen by steam reforming shows that vegetable oils are a promising feed for the process from an environmental perspective. The overall Global Warming Potential (GWP) may be reduced by 60% if traditional fossil fuel feeds like natural gas or naphtha are replaced by vegetable oils, even though they may release into the atmosphere more than twice the CO2-eq than fossil fuels during the feed-production step. It should also be noted that the CO2 emission is not the only parameter to be evaluated for this type of system; the GWP, which is a combination of CO2, CH4 and N2O emissions, needs to be evaluated. Of the three vegetable oils studied, soybean oil provides the largest GWP reduction because the emissions of nitrous oxide are low during growing.

Green ContextThe so-called hydrogen economy is becoming a dominant topic, with much impetus being behind a drive to move towards a hydrogen-based energy production. This paper describes the impact of this switch in terms of the impact of producing hydrogen from various sources, including petrochemical feedstocks and biomass. The biomass systems have considerably lower global warming potentials compared to the petrochemical based routes, for which the steam reforming process is a major burden. Within the biomass alternatives, considerable variations exist, the reasons for which are discussed.DJM
