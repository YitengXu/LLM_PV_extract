    , Accepted 7th January 2019First published on 24th January 2019AbstractV2O5–TiO2 nanocomposites with different morphological variations have been synthesized by a one-step mechanical alloying method for the first time. The surface morphologies of all the synthesized composites are revealed from their respective FESEM images. Detailed microstructure characterization of these composites has been carried out by analyzing XRD patterns employing the Rietveld refinement method, HRTEM images and FTIR spectra. The existence of a less-abundant brookite TiO2 phase in the V2O5–TiO2 nanocomposites has been confirmed for the first time by microstructure characterization, HRTEM and FTIR spectrum analysis. The optical properties of all the nanocomposites have been investigated by analyzing their respective UV-Vis absorption spectra. The photocatalytic degradation of Rhodamine B under visible light in presence of 15 h milled V2O5–TiO2 nanocomposite has been enhanced significantly to ∼89% with the addition of 1 mL of H2O2 to the aqueous solution, in comparison with both nanocrystalline TiO2 and V2O5. This is presumed to be due to both the synergistic effects of TiO2 and V2O5 and the reduction in the recombination of charge carriers in presence of H2O2.
1. Introduction
Water is one of the prime necessities of every industry and most of the used water is returned containing substantial amounts of contaminants, which significantly affects the product line of the industry as well as extensively polluting the environment.1–4 Various sources such as industries, agricultural runoff, chemical spills are positively connected with the disposal of a range of toxic pollutants that are harmful to the environment as well as to the human health.2–4 These toxic pollutants are quite stable and very difficult to degrade them by natural means.1 Traditional processes are not sufficient to purify the huge amount of highly contaminated wastewater for its reuse. Various methods have been developed for the degradation of these non-biodegradable, stable toxic pollutants from wastewater, drinking and ground surface water.5–9 Some of these methods are reverse osmosis, active sludge, flocculation, combined coagulation, electrochemical oxidation etc.10–12 Recently, semiconductor-based photocatalysts have been considered as a promising ‘green’ technique for solar energy conversion with respect to the decomposition of toxic and hazardous organic pollutants.13–15 Visible-light-driven photocatalysts are now in focus as the content of visible and ultraviolet (UV) light in sunlight is about 50% and 4%, respectively. Semiconducting metal oxides can degrade a wide variety of dyes under UV-Vis light irradiation, but the high recombination rate of the photogenerated electron–hole pairs reduces the photocatalytic efficiency of the material.16 After the discovery of photo-induced splitting of water on TiO2 electrodes,17 titanium dioxide is widely used as an environmental purifier, photoconductor, solar cell and antibacterial material due to its low cost, high chemical stability and non-toxic nature.14,18–24 V2O5 is also a bright n-type semiconducting material used as a photocatalyst to degrade organic pollutants under visible light due to its qualitative nature like non-toxicity, chemical stability, high visible light absorption and photostability.25 The use of V2O5 in the form of a nanostructure is also of great interest due to its size and morphological changes. Nanostructured V2O5 with its wide morphologies such as nanobelts, nanotubes, nanorods, nanosheets, nanowires etc. are used in many fields for modern applications.26–28 However, due to the wide band gap of TiO2, the light absorption edge of pure titanium is <387 nm and solar light cannot be used extensively in photocatalysis, as >95% of sunlight is within the visible region (400–800 nm). The low quantum yield is another main drawback of TiO2 for use as a photocatalyst, which depends on the ratio of the surface charge carrier transfer rate and the recombination rate of the photogenerated electron–hole pair.29 Several attempts had been made to minimize the low quantum yield and enhance the photocatalytic performance of TiO2 by modifying its surface structure, surface properties and composition.30–33 The surface can be modified by doping or coating with transition metals or noble metals onto the surface or into the crystal lattice of TiO2.34 Heterogeneous semiconductor-based photocatalysts have emerged as potential photocatalytic materials for water purification in which solar light can be used.16,35–39 These materials are considered as an effective tool for solar water splitting and degrading organic pollutants in wastewater with non-metallic doping elements such as boron, carbon, nitrogen, fluorine and sulphur.40–43 It is reported that the spreading of V2O5 layers over the TiO2 nanoparticles results in the enhancement of the photocatalytic activity of the nanocomposite.44–46 To enhance the photocatalytic activity of TiO2, in the present study a V2O5–TiO2 nanocomposite has been synthesized as a heterogeneous photocatalyst of brookite TiO2 and orthorhombic V2O5 phase by surface modification through spreading the V2O5 layers over the brookite TiO2 nanoparticles.
In previous reports, V2O5–TiO2 catalysts were typically synthesized by sol–gel, wet impregnation, micelle-template, electro-spinning, magnetron sputtering and direct current (DC) arc plasma processes etc. with low photocatalytic activities.47–53 However, Wang et al. reported the 90% degradation of RhB in 180 min in the presence of a 1D TiO2/V2O5 heterostructure synthesized by the RF reactive magnetron sputtering method.52 So far, there is no report on RhB degradation in the presence of a TiO2–V2O5 nanocomposite catalyst synthesized by a mechanical alloying process. The method of mechanical alloying (MA) is also an attractive procedure to synthesize heterogeneous catalysts.39,54 The kinetic energy generated during MA is utilized primarily to (i) produce heat energy through the ball-powder-ball, ball-powder-vial wall collisions, (ii) reduction of the particle size followed by an increase in surface area, (iii) formation of lattice imperfections of different kinds within the crystal lattice, (iv) increase in lattice strain, (v) local melting and (vi) formation of a new phases with alternative polymorphs.55
It is to be noted that heterostructured nanocomposites synthesized by MA with controlled morphologies have not yet been explored in the removal of organic pollutants from wastewater through photodegradation using visible light.
The primary objectives of the present study are to (i) fabricate V2O5–TiO2 heterostructured nanocomposites by mechanical alloying, (ii) structure and microstructure characterizations of nanocomposites employing X-ray diffraction and electron microscopes and (iii) study their photocatalytic performances for the degradation of an organic dye, Rhodamine B (RhB) in the presence of visible light. The Rietveld structure and micro/nanostructure refinement method56–59 has been employed to analyze the XRD patterns of all of the nanocomposites with highly overlapped reflections to determine several structural/microstructural parameters, the quantitative contents of the crystalline phases and the preferential growth direction of the nanocomposites, considering all reflections of all pertinent phases present in the respective XRD patterns.
In the present work, V2O5–TiO2 nanocomposites with controlled morphologies have been synthesized for the first time by mechanical alloying and their growth mechanism is revealed by the Rietveld refinement and time-resolved FESEM and HRTEM images. The photocatalytic properties of the nanocomposites have been investigated through the degradation of an organic dye, Rhodamine B in presence of visible light. The V2O5–TiO2 nanocomposite milled for 15 h (VT-15 h) exhibits excellent photocatalytic activity under visible light irradiation in comparison to pure TiO2 and pure V2O5 nanocrystals, both milled for 15 h with the same milling conditions, due to the synergistic effect. H2O2 plays a dual role in the photocatalytic degradation process – it prevents the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes by accepting electrons in the conduction band, as well as generating highly reactive hydroxyl radicals in presence of a photocatalyst, which results in an enhancement of the photocatalytic activity.
2. Experimental
2.1. Synthesis of V2O5–TiO2 nanocomposites by mechanical alloying
Titanium dioxide (purity 99.5%, Loba chem.) and vanadium pentoxide (purity 99.5%, Sigma Aldrich) powders were taken in an equal weight ratio for mechanical alloying in a planetary ball mill with a ball-to-powder mass ratio (BPMR) 35:1. The powder mixture was kept inside an 80 ml chrome-steel vial filled with 30 chrome-steel balls of 10 mm diameter. The mechanical synthesis of the mixture was carried out at room temperature in a planetary ball mill (P6, M/S Fritsch, GmbH, Germany) at 300 rpm for different time durations with intermittent pauses in milling to avoid possible contamination from the milling media. Pure TiO2 and V2O5 powders were milled for 15 h, V2O5–TiO2 nanocomposites milled for 5 h, 10 h, 15 h and 25 h were designated as Ti-15 h, V2O5-15 h, VT-5 h, VT-10 h, VT-15 h and VT-25 h respectively.
2.2. Material characterization
The relative phase abundances, structure and microstructure parameters of all the nanocomposites were obtained by analyzing their respective X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) patterns, recorded with Ni-filtered CuKα radiation from a Bruker D8 Advanced diffractometer within 20°–80° 2θ range in step scan mode with a step size of 0.02° 2θ and scan time 2 s per step. XRD patterns of all the nanocomposites were analyzed using the Rietveld whole-profile fitting method based on structure and microstructure refinement. The leaf-like morphology of the nanocomposites was revealed initially from FESEM images (ZEISS-SIGMA). Structure and microstructure characterizations of these nanocomposites were also revealed by analyzing HRTEM (JEOL-JEM, 2010) images. The Fourier transform infrared spectrum (FTIR) was recorded at room temperature in the range 400–4000 cm−1 with a Perkin Elmer FT-IR spectrometer using KBr pellets. Optical band gaps of the nanocomposites were obtained by analyzing UV-Vis absorption spectra recorded with an aqueous solution of the powdered samples using a UV-Vis spectrophotometer (SHIMADZU UV-1800, JAPAN) in the frequency range 200–800 nm.
2.3. Photocatalytic test
Photocatalytic activities of the pure TiO2, pure V2O5 milled for 15 h, and V2O5–TiO2 nanocomposites milled for 5 h, 10 h, 15 h and 25 h were performed through the photocatalytic degradation of a model organic pollutant Rhodamine B (RhB) dissolved in deionised water. 20 mg L−1 of each powered sample was added into 5 mg L−1 of RhB aqueous solution in a 150 mL beaker and continuously stirred for 60 min at room temperature in darkness to ensure the adsorption/de-adsorption equilibrium between RhB and the photocatalytic samples. Then the solution was exposed to visible light irradiation from a halogen lamp of 500 W power.60 The distance between the lamp and the reactor was kept at 15 cm to avoid heating from the light source on the aqueous solution and a water bath was used to maintain a constant temperature of the solution. The photo-reacted samples were collected after some interval of time to monitor the residual concentration of the RhB in the respective UV-Vis absorption spectrums.
3. Method of analysis
3.1. Rietveld refinement analysis of XRD patterns
The Rietveld's powder structure refinement method56–59 using traditional XRD data is the most efficient technique for characterizing the structure, microstructure and quantitative phase estimation of individual phases present in a multiphase compound. In the present study, to determine the structure and microstructure parameters, as well as the quantitative estimations of all the pertinent phases in these nanocomposites, the Rietveld refinement method has been adopted. As the XRD patterns of the unmilled and all ball milled powders are composed of several overlapping reflections of different phases, structure and microstructure parameters of an individual phase can only be obtained by considering all reflections of all contributing phases in these nanocomposites. The Rietveld software MAUD 2.2661 is specially designed to analyze simultaneously both the structure and microstructure through the Marquardt least-squares method. To fit the experimental profile of the samples, all kinds of instrumental corrections have been taken into consideration. Peak broadening of all phases may arise due to overlapping reflections of different phases and also from the small anisotropic crystallite size and microstrain broadening. To consider anisotropic peak broadening, the Popa rule of peak broadening has been adopted in the MAUD software.62 The progress of the refinement of the fitting is monitored by the goodness of fit (GoF), which is defined as the ratio of the weighted residual error (Rwp) and expected residual error (Rexp) expressed as,    where I0 and Ic are the experimental and calculated intensities, Wi(I/Io) and N are weight and number of experimental observations and P is the number of fitting parameters, respectively. Refinements are continued until the GoF approaches unity. In the present study, the GoFs lie within 1.3–2.0, which indicate the qualities of refinements are quite good.
4. Results and discussion
In the present study, V2O5–TiO2 heterostructured nanocomposites are fabricated by mechanical alloying the powder mixture of V2O5 and TiO2 for different time durations and their structure, microstructure and morphological growths during mechanical alloying have been characterized by analyzing the respective X-ray diffraction patterns employing the Rietveld refinement method and electron microscopy images. The photocatalytic performances of these nanocomposites have been investigated through the degradation of a model organic pollutant, Rhodamine B (RhB) in the presence of visible light.
4.1. Phase identification and quantitative phase estimation by XRD pattern analysis
X-ray powder diffraction patterns of the unmilled stoichiometric mixture of TiO2 and V2O5 powders and all the ball-milled powders collected after different milling durations are shown in Fig. 1. It is evident from Fig. 1(a) that the unmilled XRD pattern consists of a large number of sharp reflections, which are identified as the orthorhombic V2O5 phase (COD no. 1011174, a = 11.48 Å, b = 4.36 Å, c = 3.555 Å; space group, Pmn21) and tetragonal TiO2 (anatase) phase (COD no. 1530151; a = 3.78 Å, c = 9.51 Å; space group, I41/amd). Fig. 1(b–e) represent the XRD patterns of V2O5–TiO2 nanocomposites prepared at different milling times, 5 h, 10 h, 15 h and 25 h respectively. As Fig. 1(b–d) are similar, only the XRD pattern of the 15 h milled powder (Fig. 1d) is indexed with the orthorhombic V2O5 phase, tetragonal TiO2 (rutile) phase (COD no. 1530150; a = 4.59 Å, c = 2.96 Å; space group, P42/mnm) and orthorhombic TiO2 (brookite) phase (COD no. 154606, a = 9.166 Å, b = 5.4110 Å, c = 5.1490 Å; space group, Pbca). A significant change is noticed in Fig. 1(e) and this XRD pattern has been indexed to only the V2O5 and brookite TiO2 phase. It is to be noted that even after 25 h of milling, there is no trace of any impurity phase either from the precursors or from the milling media.

Fig. 2(a and b) represent the XRD patterns of the TiO2 nanocrystals (TiO2-15 h) and V2O5–TiO2 nanocomposites (VT-15 h) prepared after 15 h of milling under the same experimental conditions. In the case of pure TiO2, the anatase phase primarily transforms to a polymorphic rutile TiO2 and another high-pressure monoclinic phase of TiO2 (hp) (COD no. 154035, a = 4.5890 Å, b = 4.8490 Å, c = 4.7360 Å, β = 100.89°, space group, P21/c). However, in the VT-15 h nanocomposite, a significant amount of polymorphic TiO2 brookite phase has been formed along with a trace amount of rutile TiO2 and the unreacted orthorhombic V2O5 phase. The transformation from anatase TiO2 to a polymorphic brookite phase may have occurred due to the substitutional replacement63 of some Ti4+ by an equivalent amount of V5+ cations in the TiO2 lattice. The unit cell volume of the V2O5 alloyed brookite phase is smaller than that of the pure brookite phase as the ionic radius of V5+ (0.54 Å) is smaller than that of Ti4+ (0.605 Å) ions. Also, the ‘a’ lattice parameter of the V5+ induced brookite phase is nearly equal to the ‘c’ lattice parameter of the anatase phase. Thus, it is clearly evident that the inclusion of orthorhombic vanadium oxide into the tetragonal anatase TiO2 (A-TiO2) lattice results in coherent growth of polymorphic orthorhombic brookite phase (B-TiO2) with a c-axis parallel to the a-axis of the anatase phase (aA-TiO2‖cB-TiO2).64

4.2. Nanostructure characterization of the composites by Rietveld refinement

Fig. 3 represents the typical Rietveld refinement output of the XRD patterns of the unmilled (0 h) and V2O5–TiO2 nanocomposites. The goodness of fit (GoF) ∼1.0 for all these patterns indicates the quality of the fitting is quite good. It is revealed that the experimental XRD patterns are composed of four different crystalline phases. Accordingly, the theoretical XRD patterns are simulated with these identified crystalline phases: V2O5 (V), anatase TiO2 (A), rutile TiO2 (R) and brookite TiO2 (B) phases. The peak positions of the respective phases are shown with different colour markers (|). Fig. 3(a) represents the Rietveld refinement output of the unmilled powder mixture of V2O5–TiO2 (0 h). It is found that the lattice parameters of the orthorhombic V2O5 phase and those of the tetragonal anatase TiO2 phase are close to the reported values. A significant change is noticed in Fig. 3(b), after ball-milling the mixture for 5 h. The anatase TiO2 phase transforms into polymorphic rutile and brookite TiO2 phases with a significant change in the V2O5 lattice parameters. The nature of the variations of the intensities in the XRD patterns of 10 h and 15 h milled nanocomposites are quite similar (Fig. 3(c and d)). However, after 25 h of milling, the XRD pattern of the nanocomposite changes to a large extent dominating the V2O5 phase, like the unmilled powder mixture (Fig. 3(e)). The Rietveld refinement reveals that this nanocomposite is composed only of the V2O5 phase with lattice parameters, a = 11.772 Å, b = 4.259 Å, c = 3.679 Å and the brookite TiO2 phase with lattice parameters, a = 9.385 Å, b = 5.308 Å and c = 4.907 Å, which are significantly different from the reported values. The variation of the lattice parameters of these phases are plotted in the subsequent section.
 Fig. 3  Typical Rietveld analysis output profiles of V2O5–TiO2 powder mixture milled for different durations. The observed (experimental) data (hollow red dots) are represented by I0, simulated (calculated) pattern (continuous black line) represented by Ic and (I0 − Ic) represents the residual fitting intensity (solid green lines) plotted under respective XRD patterns; (a) unmilled (0 h) mixture, powder mixture milled for (b) 5 h, (c) 10 h, (c) 15 h and (d) 25 h. 

Fig. 4(a and b) show the comparison between the Rietveld refinement output of the XRD patterns of TiO2-15 h with the VT-15 h nanocomposites, synthesized by mechanical alloying the anatase TiO2 powder and TiO2–V2O5 powder mixture (1:1 wt ratio) for 15 h at room temperature in open air. It is clearly evident that these XRD patterns have more differences than similarities. After 15 h of milling, the anatase TiO2 transforms primarily to a rutile phase along with a trace amount of the high-pressure TiO2 phase. However, when an equal amount of V2O5 is added to anatase TiO2, the brookite-TiO2 emerges as the dominating phase along with the unreacted V2O5 phase. The lattice parameters of the rutile TiO2 phase becomes a = 4.604 Å, c = 2.96 Å and the new high pressure monoclinic TiO2 phase appears with lattice parameters a = 4.7516 Å, b = 4.695 Å, c = 4.9826 Å and β = 100.89°.

The variations in the relative abundances of the different crystalline phases in the nanocomposites developed over the course of different milling time are shown in Fig. 5.
 Fig. 5  Phase content variations in the nanocomposites with different milling hours of (a) rutile, (b) brookite, (c) anatase and (d) V2O5 phases. 

Fig. 5(a) shows that with increasing milling time, the rutile TiO2 phase increases slowly over up to 5 h of milling and then reduces continuously with further increase of milling time and finally disappears after 25 h of milling. Fig. 5(b) shows that the content of the brookite TiO2 phase increases sharply to ∼66% within 5 h of milling and then increases slowly with increasing milling time and finally reaches ∼70% after 25 h of milling. Fig. 5(c) shows the variation of the anatase TiO2 phase which reduces sharply to zero within 5 h of milling. Fig. 5(d) shows that the content of the V2O5 phase in the un-milled sample is ∼66%, which reduces sharply within 5 h of milling to ∼31% and then remains almost invariant up to 25 h of milling. These observations clearly illustrate that all the polymorphic phase transitions of TiO2 in the presence of V2O5 have been initiated and also completed within 5 h of ball milling.
The variation of the lattice parameters of the orthorhombic brookite TiO2 phase is shown in Fig. 6(a–c). Fig. 6(a and b) show that the lattice parameters a and b change inversely with each other with increasing milling time and both b and c reduce continuously over up to 25 h of milling (Fig. 6(b and c)).
 Fig. 6  (a–c) Represent the variation of lattice parameters a, b and c of brookite TiO2 phase in V2O5–TiO2 nanocomposites with increasing milling time. 

Fig. 7(a–c) depicts the variation of the lattice parameters of the orthorhombic V2O5 phase with milling time in the V2O5–TiO2 nanocomposites. It is evident that the nature of the variation of the lattice parameters is quite similar to that of the brookite TiO2. From both Fig. 6 and 7, it is clearly evident that significant change in the lattice parameters of both these phases have occurred after 15 h and continued for up to 25 h of milling the nanocomposites; the inclination of the lattice parameters ‘b’ and ‘c’ of both the brookite and the V2O5 phases decrease, whereas the ‘a’ parameter increases in both the cases.
 Fig. 7  (a–c) Represent the variation of lattice parameters a, b and c of orthorhombic V2O5 phase with milling time in the V2O5–TiO2 nanocomposites respectively. 

Fig. 8(a) shows that up to 15 h of milling, the particle size of the B(210) plane increases rapidly from ∼22.44 nm to ∼54.2 nm and then decreases suddenly to ∼9.38 nm after 25 h of milling. However, the nature of the microstrain behaves in a reverse manner than the usual cases and decreases to a minimum value of 2.47 × 10−3 after 25 h of milling as shown in Fig. 8(b). In the case of the orthorhombic V2O5 phase, the particle size of the V(400) plane decreases from ∼169.39 nm to ∼99.31 nm within 15 h of milling, then increases after further milling and finally reaches a value of ∼108.55 nm after 25 h of milling, as clearly shown in Fig. 8(c). The variation of the microstrain of the V(400) plane with milling time is shown in Fig. 8(d). It is evident that the value of the microstrain is about zero up to 10 h of milling and then after further milling up to 25 h, the microstrain increases sharply in the usual manner. This indicates that after 15 h of milling, the accumulated mechanical energy through prolonged mechanical alloying is primarily utilized to increase and decrease the microstrain of V2O5 and the brookite phases respectively. It is clearly evident from the Fig. 8 that the difference of particle size between the B(210) plane and the V(400) plane is minimal in the 15 h milled nanocomposite.

4.3. FTIR spectra analysis

Fig. 9(a) shows some distinct peaks in the 15 h milled sample of V2O5–TiO2 (VT-15 h) which are not observed either in the spectra of the unmilled sample of V2O5–TiO2 composites (VT-0 h) (Fig. 9(b)) or in the 15 h milled sample of the pure TiO2 (TiO2-15 h) (Fig. 9(c)). The sharp peak centred at 1013 cm−1 is assigned to the VO stretching band of V2O5.65 The other sharp peaks centred at 1634 cm−1 and 3406 cm−1 may be assigned to the brookite TiO2 phase, which have been shifted from their respective assigned positions 1637 cm−1 and 3445 cm−1, respectively, due to the change of bond lengths in the nanocrystalline brookite phase obtained through mechanical alloying. The other sharp peak at 2922 cm−1 is assigned to the rutile TiO2 phase.66

4.4. FESEM image analysis
The morphological growth of the V2O5–TiO2 nanocomposites persists in the process of mechanosynthesis and the sequential morphological modifications of the nanocomposites are revealed clearly in the course of milling. The nanoflake/leaf type morphology of the composite appears within 5 h of milling as shown in Fig. 10(a). After 10 h (Fig. 10(b)) and 15 h (Fig. 10(c)) of milling, same morphology is retained but the size of the nanoflake has reduced considerably with milling time. Further milling up to 25 h results in a significant change in the morphology of the nanocomposite and the flake type morphology completely changes to a granule/particles type morphology as shown in Fig. 10(d). This indicates that due to the prolonged high energy impact on the nanoflake, it transforms into a granular shape morphology.

In case of the 15 h milled TiO2 powder, the flake type morphology did not appear (Fig. 11(a and c)) in the FESEM images, as in the case of the V2O5–TiO2 nanocomposite (Fig. 11(b and d)). This indicates that the nanoflake type morphology appears only in the presence of V2O5 with TiO2i.e. only after formation of the nanocomposites.

4.5. TEM analysis
The V2O5–TiO2 nanocomposite formed after 15 h of milling is composed of brookite TiO2 (∼71.69 wt%), V2O5 (∼28.0 wt%) and a trace amount of the rutile TiO2 (∼0.31%) phases. HRTEM images clearly reveal the coexistence of the V2O5 and the brookite phases within the nanocomposite. Fig. 12(a) (shown inset) reveals the presence of the (210) plane of the TiO2 brookite phase with an interplanar spacing of 0.348 nm.67 The existence of the (400) plane of the V2O5 phase (Fig. 12(b)) with an interplanar spacing 0.286 nm is also identified at the vicinity of the brookite phase, which confirms the composite nature of the milled powder.

The SAED pattern of the VT-15 h nanocomposite reveals the combined existence of V2O5 and TiO2 phases and the multiple orders of the brookite (211) and the V2O5 (400) reflections with identical d-spacings have been indexed. These lines have high intensity and are broad due to the overlapping of two reflections with an almost equal interplanar spacing as shown in Fig. 13.

The elemental chemical compositions of the nanocomposite has been verified by performing energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy analysis using a high angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM-HAADF). Fig. 14(a) represents the STEM-HAADF image of the V2O5–TiO2 nanocomposites (15 h) with a nanoflake/leaf type morphology. Homogeneous elemental mappings of O, V and Ti on the nanoleaf are shown in Fig. 14(b–d), respectively, and confirm the formation of the V2O5–TiO2 nanocomposite after 15 h of milling. However, the quantitative elemental distribution revealed from a line segment drawn on the surface of the nanoleaf (Fig. 14(e) red line, shown inset) evidenced that the nanoleaf is enriched with V. This implies that V2O5 plays an important role in the leaf-like morphology with its spreading over the nanoparticles of the brookite TiO2 phase, which is evident in Fig. 14(b–d). As a result, there is a modification of the physicochemical properties of TiO2, which results in enhancement of its catalytic activities.45,46 The EDX spectrum (Fig. 14(f)) confirms the presence of V, O and Ti in the nanocomposite. It is also to be noted that the content of brookite TiO2 is higher than that of V2O5, which corroborates well with the Rietveld refinement result. Indicating that the distributions of the TiO2 and V2O5 phases are not perfectly homogeneous over the entire area of the leaf – the outer petal part is enriched with V2O5 and the lower bottom part of the leaf is enriched with TiO2.

4.6. UV-Vis analysis

Fig. 15(a–d) depicts the optical absorption spectra of the V2O5–TiO2 nanocomposites formed after 5 h, 10 h, 15 h and 25 h of milling, respectively, within the wavelength range 200–800 nm and that of the pure TiO2 nanocrystals synthesized after 15 h of milling, as shown in the inset of the figure. In the case of the 5 h milled powder, two major absorbance bands appear at ∼392 nm and ∼253 nm, as shown in Fig. 15(a). These two peaks appear mostly due to the TiO2 and V2O5 phases, respectively. The reported values of the two absorbance bands of V2O5 are ∼263 nm and ∼412 nm.68 For the 10 h milled sample, the two corresponding absorbance bands appear at ∼394 nm and ∼257 nm respectively (Fig. 15(b)). Fig. 15(c and d) show that the absorbance spectra of the 15 h and 25 h milled samples remain almost invariant. However, the absorbance spectrum of the pure TiO2-15 h sample shows only one band at ∼ 340 nm (Fig. 15(e) (inset)).

In Fig. 16(a and b) variations of the band gap energy of the brookite TiO2 and V2O5 phases are represented, respectively, in the nanocomposites with increasing milling duration. It is evident that within 15 h of milling the band gap energy of the semiconducting brookite TiO2 phase increases with increase of the particle size and then decreases over up to 25 h of milling due to a decrease of the particle size. On the other hand, the band gap energy of V2O5 decreases with the decrease of the particle size within 15 h of milling and then increases over up to 25 h of milling due to an increase of the particle size. It also reveals that the in the 15 h milled nanocomposite, the particle size of V2O5 is minimum and that of the brookite TiO2 is maximum as shown in Fig. 8. So the band gap energy of V2O5 is minimum and that for the brookite TiO2 is maximum.69 As a result, the difference in the band gap energy between V2O5 and the brookite TiO2 gradually becomes minimal, which can stimulate the photocatalytic activity of the 15 h milled V2O5–TiO2 nanocomposite sample (VT-15 h) (Fig. 17).

4.7. Photocatalytic mechanism
The mechanism of the dye degradation by the process of photocatalysis follows the following steps: electrons are promoted to conduction band from the valence band resulting in the generation of an electron–hole pair after irradiating the catalyst with the proper wavelength of light and they can migrate to the catalyst surface. Catalyst + hν → ecb− + hvb+(1)where ecb− represents the electron in the conduction band and hvb+ represents the hole in the valence band. They participate in the redox reaction with the species present on the catalytic surface. The ˙OH radicals can be formed with the help of the hvb+ which react with the surface-bound H2O and ecb− can react with O2 to form the superoxide radical anion of oxygen through the following steps: hvb+ + H2O → ˙OH + H+(2) ecb− + O2 → O2−˙(3)The formation of free radicals prevents the recombination of the electron and the hole. The ˙OH and O2−˙ radicals can then react with the dye to form other species which are responsible for the discolouration/degradation of the dye through the following processes: O2−˙ + H2O→ H2O2(4) H2O2 → 2˙OH(5) ˙OH + dye → dyeoxi(6) ecb− + dye → dyeredox(7)The photocatalytic degradation is directly related to the amount of reactive oxidative species (ROS) present in the aqueous solution, which can be generated as a result of the generation of electron–hole pairs upon the irradiation with the proper light. Electron acceptors such as oxygen or H2O2 can also enhance photocatalytic degradation, which is added as an electron acceptor to enhance the photocatalytic reaction. Photocatalytic degradation is enhanced with the addition of H2O2 in low concentrations through inhibiting the recombination of the electron–hole pairs, with acceptance of the electrons in the conduction band to increase the concentration of hydroxyl radicals. Thus with the increase of hydroxyl radicals, the photocatalytic activity is significantly enhanced.70 The enhancement of the photocatalytic activity in presence of H2O2 can be explained by the following reactions.71 H2O2 + ecb− → ˙OH + OH−(8) H2O2 + hν → 2˙OH(9)However, at higher concentration of H2O2, it can react with the hydroxyl radicals and converts them to perhydroxyl radicals, which is a weak oxidant under solar light. Thus, the reduction in photocatalytic activity can be understood from the following reactions72 H2O2 + ˙OH → H2O + OH2˙(10) H2O2 + hvb+→ H+ + OH2˙(11)
4.8. Photocatalytic activity
Photocatalytic activities of the V2O5–TiO2 nanocomposites are investigated by the photodegradation of a model organic pollutant RhB in an aqueous solution under visible light irradiation at room temperature, in comparison to the pure TiO2 nanocrystals milled for 15 h. The investigation has been extended further to explore the enhanced photocatalytic performance of the V2O5–TiO2 nanocomposite (milled for 15 h) with the addition of different amounts of H2O2 (1 mL and 5 mL) in 150 mL RhB solution. The organic pollutant RhB is stable in aqueous solution and does not show any photodegradation under visible light irradiation in the absence of a photocatalyst. Photodegradation of the V2O5–TiO2 nanocomposites milled for different durations (5 h, 10 h, 15 h and 25 h) does not occur in absence of light. Degradation of RhB in an aqueous solution, in the presence of the nanocomposite catalysts, is activated by irradiation of visible light through some photochemical reactions.
The photodecomposition rate D of the RhB is calculated by the relation, D = [(C0 − C)/C0] × 100%(12)where C0 be the initial concentration of the RhB and C is the concentration at different irradiation times.

Fig. 18(a–d) show the variation of C/C0, where C0 is the initial concentration of the RhB dye and C is the concentration of the RhB dye after different times for the photochemical reaction in the presence of the nanocomposites and visible light. The initial concentration of the RhB dye in the aqueous solution was 5 mg L−1 and in 150 mL of RhB aqueous solution, 4 mg of each nanocomposite has been added separately under visible light irradiation. Fig. 18(a) shows that the variation of C/C0 under visible light decreases very slowly for the 5 h milled nanocomposite and the degradation is ∼19% in 270 min. In the 10 h milled nanocomposite, C/C0 decreases at a faster rate and the degradation reaches ∼55% in 270 min, as shown in Fig. 18(b). However, in the 15 h milled nanocomposite degradation rate is ∼66% in 270 min and then becomes almost constant, as shown in Fig. 18(c). It is surprising to note that instead of a further increase in the degradation rate with the milling duration up to 25 h, the degradation reduces to ∼47% (Fig. 18(d)). It is evident from the figure that the best, ∼89% photocatalytic performance, is achieved with the addition of 1 mL of H2O2 in the solution (Fig. 18(e)) than 5 mL of H2O2, where the degradation is ∼83% (Fig. 18(f)). Thus the maximum photodegradation is observed in the 15 h milled nanocomposite in the presence of 1 mL H2O2 in 150 mL of solution within 270 min, for which the flake/leaf-like morphology has been observed in the FESEM images. It indicates that the morphology of the nanocomposite plays an important role in the photodegradation process in the presence of 1 mL H2O2. The H2O2 in the solution may act as an external electron acceptor to reduce the recombination of charge carriers.73

Variations of C/C0 with time for the pure TiO2 powder (Ti-15 h), the V2O5 (V2O5-15 h) powder and the V2O5-TiO2 powder (VT-15 h) milled for 15 h under the same milling condition are shown in the inset of Fig. 19. It reveals that the RhB degradation in the Ti-15 h powder is only ∼3% within 210 min, but significantly higher degradation rates of ∼59% and ∼62.25% are observed for the V2O5-15 h and the VT-15 h nanocomposite samples, respectively. It is thus evident that the nanocrystalline TiO2 powder is a poor catalyst for RhB degradation. Catalytic activity has been increased to a great extent in the case of the nanocomposites, in the presence of brookite TiO2 and V2O5 heterojunction. Reaction rate constants are calculated assuming first order kinetics (eqn (13)) for a low initial pollutant concentration.74 ln(C0/C) = Kt(13)
 Fig. 19  Comparison of the rate constant of RhB degradation with pure TiO2, V2O5 and V2O5–TiO2 nanocomposites samples, are milled for 15 h under same conditions, (a) pure TiO2, (b) V2O5 and (c) V2O5–TiO2 nanocomposite. Inset RhB degradation of the 15 h milled sample of (a) pure TiO2 (b) V2O5–TiO2 and (c) V2O5–TiO2 nanocomposite. 

Fig. 20 shows a linear relationship between ln(C0/C) and the reaction time, indicating that the photodegradation of RhB follows first order kinetics. From Fig. 20(a–f) the apparent rate constants (k) are determined as, k = 8.310 × 10−4 min−1, 2.92 × 10−3 min−1, 4.11 × 10−3 min−1 and 2.28 × 10−3 min−1, 8.29 × 10−3 min−1 and 6.64 × 10−3 min−1 for 5 h, 10 h, 15 h, 25 h, 15 h milled nanocomposite with 1 mL H2O2 and 5 mL H2O2 respectively. For the 15 h milled pure TiO2 and pure V2O5 samples, the rate constant is k = 1.5466 × 10−4 min−1 and 4.2 × 10−3 min−1 as shown in Fig. 19(a and b), respectively. From these observations, it is thus obvious that the 15 h milled V2O5–TiO2 nanocomposite is a better catalyst than the 15 h milled pure TiO2 and pure V2O5 samples. The VT-15 h sample shows superior photocatalytic activity among all the nanocomposites milled for different durations, this may be due to the flake/leaf-like morphology with increases the surface area and the minimal band gap energy difference between the heterojunction of brookite TiO2 (orthorhombic) nanoparticles and the V2O5 (orthorhombic) coated nanolayers. The VT-15 h sample shows enhanced photocatalytic performance in the presence of 1 mL H2O2 than 5 mL H2O2 in a 150 mL aqueous solution of RhB.

5. Conclusions
A number of V2O5–TiO2 nanocomposites have been synthesized by mechanical alloying for the accelerated removal of organic pollutant from wastewater. Microstructure characterization and the relative phase abundances of these milled nanocomposites have been carried out employing the Rietveld refinement, FTIR and analyzing HRTEM images. Elemental compositions/mappings of these nanocomposites have been accomplished from HRTEM EDX spectra. Sequential changes in the morphology with increasing milling time from the flake/leaf-like to granular type have been clearly revealed from the FESEM images. It is observed that after 15 h of milling, the anatase (pure) TiO2 transformed to rutile and high-pressure polymorphic phases, whereas the nanocomposites become a composite of the polymorphic brookite TiO2 and the V2O5 phases with a trace amount of rutile TiO2. The leaf-like morphology formed after 15 h of milling of the nanocomposite transforms to granular-like within 25 h of milling. The difference of particle size and the band gap energy between the heterojunction of the brookite TiO2 and the V2O5 nanocrystals is found to be at a minimum in the 15 h milled nanocomposite among all the samples. Photodegradation studies of a model organic pollutant RhB in aqueous solution with the nanocomposites and nanocrystalline pure TiO2 and V2O5 in the presence of visible light reveal that the 15 h milled nanocomposite has superior photocatalytic activity. An addition of 1 mL of H2O2 in 1a 50 mL aqueous solution results in an enhanced rate of degradation to ∼89% within 270 min. The probable reasons for such enhanced photocatalytic property may be due to the leaf-like morphology of the nanocomposite, heterojunction generated between the brookite TiO2 and the V2O5 interfaces with less band gap energy, the spreading of the V2O5 over TiO2, and also the optimum amount of phases present in the VT-15 h nanocomposite. The notable photocatalytic activity of this nanocomposite is reported for the first time for the case of a mechanosynthesized material. This facile approach obviously opens up pathways to synthesize novel photocatalysts with potential applications for the accelerated removal of a huge amount of organic pollutants from wastewater that is released every day from the textile, chemical and other industries.
