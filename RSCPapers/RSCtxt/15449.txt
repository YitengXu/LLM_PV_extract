    , Accepted 3rd March 2022First published on 3rd March 2022AbstractThe emerging wide-bandgap CsPbCl3 perovskite shows great potential for applications in ultraviolet (UV) detection due to its excellent UV response property and UV irradiation durability. However, the abundant Cl vacancies existing in CsPbCl3 would cause severe charge recombination losses, significantly decreasing the detection performance of the photodetectors, especially for the self-powered ones. Herein, a Cl-containing ionic liquid (IL) of 1-butyl-2,3-dimethylimidazolium chloride ([BMMIm]Cl) is introduced to passivate the surface defects of the evaporated CsPbCl3 polycrystalline films. Experimental characterizations and density functional theory calculations demonstrate that the electron-rich nitrogen and chlorine atoms in the [BMMIm]Cl layer can bond with the uncoordinated positively charged Pb2+ ions, effectively suppressing the Cl vacancy defects of the CsPbCl3 films. The IL layer can also help to increase the structural stability of CsPbCl3 and ameliorate the energy level alignment of the devices. These all contribute to a faster charge transport process with a lower non-radiative recombination rate, yielding a pronounced augmentation in the device performance. The best-performing [BMMIm]Cl-modified photodetector delivers an ultrafast response time of 1.74 μs, an excellent on/off ratio of 2.70 × 105, and a high specific detectivity of 6.19 × 1012 Jones at 0 V bias. Moreover, the as-fabricated CsPbCl3 photodetectors exhibit salient stabilities under continuous UV illumination and thermal attacks at 85 °C in air. Since no charge transport layer is applied and carbon electrode is chosen to replace the noble metal electrode, the whole production costs of our devices are quietly low. Our work provides a feasible strategy for the scalable production of self-powered, low-cost, and high-performance UV photodetectors.
1. Introduction
UV photodetection has become another research hotspot in the photodetection field after infrared detection and visible light detection, which shows promising applications in military warning, medical analysis, biological monitoring, and optical communication1,2 The widely researched UV photodetectors based on wide-bandgap GaN, Ga2O3, and ZnO semiconductors always suffer slow carrier mobility, low response speed, and low photocurrent output.3–5 Although organic photodetectors have also attracted increasing attention owing to their tunable spectral response range and large EQE values over 100% with gain,6,7 their preparation process is relatively complex, involving the use of many poisonous solvents. This makes it necessary to develop a new generation of photosensitive semiconductors for high-performance UV detection. In the past decade, perovskites have been indubitably the hottest semiconductors in the optoelectronic field due to their merits of high light absorption and conversion coefficient, tunable bandgaps, high carrier mobility, and defect tolerance.8–13 The prevalent perovskite materials, including MA-/FA-based organic–inorganic perovskites and I-/Br-based all-inorganic perovskites, are either unstable to UV irradiation or do not have UV-matchable wide bandgap.2,14 Compared to them, CsPbCl3 perovskite possesses a suitable wide optical bandgap (∼2.99 eV), prominent UV response property as well as high UV durability, showing great prospects in UV detection.15,16
The previously reported CsPbCl3-based UV photodetectors are mainly constructed by CsPbCl3 nano-crystal/platelet,2,17–19 micro-wire/platelet/crystal,1,20–22 and single crystal.23 These devices can be mainly divided into photoconductive and phototransistor types, which usually possess horizontal architectures with the CsPbCl3 layer lying between the electrodes. These kinds of devices need an external power supply to work, inevitably enlarging the energy consumption and volume of the system. Besides, their response times are always too long (microsecond-scale) to capture high-frequency UV signals,18,19 restricting their application scope. In comparison with the nano- or micro-structured CsPbCl3 photosensitive layers, the polycrystalline CsPbCl3 film with micrometer-sized crystals has fewer grain boundaries (GBs) and carrier recombination sites.24 Since the PbCl2 and CsCl precursors are hardly dissolved in a common solvent simultaneously, it still remains challenging to prepare high-quality CsPbCl3 continuous films in a facile solution method.25 This sets obstacles to the fabrication of high-performance, self-powered CsPbCl3 photodetectors. Recently, Zhu's group developed an intermediate phase halide exchange strategy, including the spin-coating processes of PbBr2/CsI and MACl/CsCl solutions, to deposit CsPbCl3–Cs4PbCl6 polycrystalline films for their applications in self-driven UV photodetection.15 This method was easy to operate, but the crystallization process of the CsPbCl3 perovskite was hard to control. The existence of large amounts of Cs4PbCl6 phase in the final film would significantly decrease the optical and electrical properties of the photosensitive layers. As a result, the photodetectors only obtained a responsivity (R) and specific detectivity (D*) of 0.0618 A W−1 and 1.35 × 1012 Jones. Vapor deposition techniques could ignore the poor solubility of perovskite precursors, bringing new hope to the fabrication of high-quality CsPbCl3 films. Yang, et al. reported a dual source co-evaporation route to deposit CsPbCl3 films.24 Although continuous and homogeneous films were attained, their absorption capability was low, whilst the GB density was high owing to the low controllability of the co-evaporation process. Thus, the device delivered a low on/off ratio and response speed. To enhance the controllability and reproducibility of the vapor deposition process, our group proposed a sequential evaporation method, in which the phase component of the resultant CsPbCl3 films could be easily manipulated by adjusting the thickness of the CsCl layers.16 The as-fabricated devices exhibited good UV detection performance, but the thermal stability was not encouraging due to the reaction of the migrated Cl− with the Ag electrode. Qin's group presented a single-source evaporation method to deposit CsPbCl3 polycrystalline films to further simplify the vapor deposition process.25 The equimolar PbCl2 and CsCl precursor powders were ball-milled together beforehand and then simultaneously evaporated onto the substrate in one source. The devices got a fast UV response speed (0.12/0.82 μs), but the R and D* were still not satisfactory. Moreover, the devices employed high-temperature treated TiO2, expensive spiro-PT/spiro-OMeTAD and Au as the electron transport layer, hole transport layer, and electrode, respectively. This dramatically raised the whole product costs of the photodetectors, hindering their commercial applications.
For perovskite polycrystalline films, there always exist many defects (such as interstitials, vacancies, and anti-sites) at the interface and GBs.26 The defects could not only deteriorate the device performance by accelerating the charge trapping and recombination but also affect the intrinsic stability of perovskite films.27 Various methods, including doping (halogen anions, metal cations, organic polymer, and ionic liquid),27–33 surface passivation (acid, polymer, multifunctional two dimensional materials, quantum dots, and ionic liquid),34–39 and process improvement (gas/vacuum-assisted crystallization, near-infrared annealing, solvent engineering, etc.)40–45 have been adopted to passivate the perovskite defects. Nevertheless, the preliminary studies on the self-powered CsPbCl3 photodetectors are all focusing on the fabrication process of the CsPbCl3 photoactive layers, while the defect passivation and performance optimization of the CsPbCl3 photodetectors are rarely reported. Therefore, the performance of the self-driven CsPbCl3-based photodetectors lags much behind the other perovskite-based counterparts.
Inspired by the previous defect passivation works on other types of perovskites, a Cl-containing ionic liquid (IL) of 1-butyl-2,3-dimethylimidazolium chloride ([BMMIm]Cl) is introduced to passivate the surface and GB defects of the evaporated CsPbCl3 films. The impacts of the [BMMIm]Cl IL modification layer on the optical, electrical, and morphological properties of the CsPbCl3 film are systematically investigated. Experimental analysis and density functional theory (DFT) calculation validate that the [BMMIm]Cl IL can effectively passivate the interface defects of CsPbCl3 through the interaction between the uncoordinated Pb2+ and the electron-rich nitrogen atom in [BMMIm]Cl. The Cl− in the IL also helps to reduce the Cl vacancy in the CsPbCl3 crystal. It is also found that the [BMMIm]Cl modification can shift the conduction band of the CsPbCl3 film down close to that of the FTO electrode. These all are conducive to charge transport and recombination suppression. The concentration of the [BMMIm]Cl is optimized and the best-performing device achieves an ultrafast response speed of 1.74 μs and an ultrahigh on/off ratio of 2.7 × 105 under 375 nm illumination at 0 V bias voltage. In addition, the [BMMIm]Cl-modified devices exhibit enhanced moisture, thermal and UV irradiation stability, which can be mainly attributed to the declined defect densities and improved hydrophobicity of the [BMMIm]Cl-modified CsPbCl3 layer. These results highlight the passivation effect of ILs on CsPbCl3 perovskite films and open a new avenue to produce self-powered high-performance CsPbCl3 UV photodetectors.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Materials
The lead chloride (PbCl2) and cesium chloride (CsCl) powders with purification of >99.99% were bought from Xi’an p-OLED. The 1-butyl-2,3-dimethylimidazolium chloride IL (>99%) was purchased from Alfa Aesar. All the materials were directly used without further treatment.
2.2. Device fabrication
The laser-etched FTO substrates (NSG-10) were ultrasonically cleaned by acetone, ethanol, and deionized water, each for 15 min, respectively. The substrate was further dried by N2 flow and subjected to an ultraviolet ozone treatment for another 30 min to remove the organic residues. The CsPbCl3 photoactive films were fabricated by a thermal evaporation method as reported by our group.16 The thickness of the PbCl2 and CsCl precursor layers was around 200 and 170 nm, respectively. For the [BMMIm]Cl-modified devices, [BMMIm]Cl solutions with concentrations of 2.5, 5, and 7.5 mg ml−1 in isopropanol were spin-coated onto the CsPbCl3 films at a speed of 5000 rpm, followed by annealing at 70 °C for 30 min. Finally, carbon counter electrodes were prepared using a doctor-blading technique and dried at 100 °C for 15 min.
2.3. Device characterizations
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) characterizations of the non-modified and [BMMIm]Cl-modified CsPbCl3 layers were taken on an x'pert3 powder X-ray diffractometer (PANalytical, Netherland) with a scanning step size of ∼0.013°. The morphologies of the non-modified and [BMMIm]Cl-modified CsPbCl3 films in nanoscale were measured by scanning electron microscopy (Nova NanoSEM 450, FEI, Netherlands). The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) surveys of the corresponding films were obtained via a photoelectron spectrometer (AXIS-ULTRA DLD-600W, Kratos, Shimadzu, Japan). The light absorbance spectra of these films were obtained via a UV-vis spectrophotometer (UV 2600, Shimadzu, Japan). The surface roughness of the non-modified and [BMMIm]Cl-modified films were determined by atomic force microscopy (AFM, Innova SPM 9700, Shimadzu, Japan). The PL characteristics of the non-modified and [BMMIm]Cl-modified samples were tested on the FluoTime300 using a 375 nm excitation laser. The space-charge limited current (SCLC) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analyses of the photodetectors were performed on an electrochemical station (Autolab PGSTA302N, Netherlands) under dark conditions. The UV light response and dark I–V characteristics of the non-modified and [BMMIm]Cl-modified photodetectors were gained by a source meter (Keithley 2636B). The fast UV response properties of the photodetectors were recorded by an oscilloscope. The excitation signals in the response tests were generated by a 375 nm UV light source equipped with a controller and a function waveform generator (Keysight 33210A).
2.4. Computational details
The theoretical DFT calculations were conducted using the VASP code on the basis of the projector-augmented wave method.46 The electronic exchange and correlation energies were evaluated through the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE)47 generalized gradient approximation (GGA). An energy cutoff of 400 eV for the plane-wave expansion was applied, and the convergence of energy and force were set as 1 × 10−4 eV per atom and 0.05 eV Å−1, respectively. The CsPbCl3 perovskite with a tetragonal phase (a = 7.968 Å, b = 7.968 Å, c = 5.811 Å) was selected in the calculation work. For CsPbCl3/[BMMIm]Cl hybrid models, a 3 × 3 supercell with a three-layer periodic slab was selected. A 20 Å vacuum region was inserted on the top and the bottom layer was fixed. For the sampling of the first Brillouin zone, the Γ point was only considered. The outermost s, p, and d (in the case of Pb) electrons were regarded as valence electrons. The chemical phase diagram was plotted according to the Chesta code employing the total energies of related phases.48
3. Results and discussion

Fig. 1a depicts the schematics of the preparation process of the CsPbCl3-based UV photodetectors, in which the CsPbCl3 photosensitive layer is deposited by a sequential evaporation method as optimized by our group.16 The inserted camera image shows high uniformity of the CsPbCl3 film. The high transparency of the film indicates a weak absorption of visible light, enabling the selective response to the UV signals. The atom ratio of the Cs, Pb, and Cl of the evaporated CsPbCl3 perovskite inferred from the XPS survey is around 0.98:1:2.06 (Fig. 2a–c). It suggests that abundant Cl vacancies exist on the surface of the film, coinciding well with the previous work.2 Although the halide vacancy in perovskite is widely considered as a shallow level defect, it will still cause undesired carrier transfer dynamics and severe recombination loss.26 In view of this, the [BMMIm]Cl IL with an electron-rich nitrogen atom and Cl atom is introduced to modify the CsPbCl3 film. The N atom with lone pair of electrons can bond with the uncoordinated Pb2+ in CsPbCl3 (Fig. 1b), helping to reduce the Cl vacancy defects.49 The negatively charged chloride can also bond with the positively charged Pb2+.27 The hydrophobic alkyl chain of [BMMIm]Cl anchored on the CsPbCl3 surface also yields a higher moisture resistance of the film, contributing to higher stability of the final photodetectors.

To manifest the existence of the bond formation between the positively Pb2+ and [BMMIm]Cl, the Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) measurement is carried out for the PbCl2/[BMMIm]Cl, CsCl/[BMMIm]Cl, and bare [BMMIm]Cl samples. The stretching vibration peak at around 1587.4 cm−1 for the bare [BMMIm]Cl film can be assigned to the CN bond (Fig. 1c). In comparison, this peak of the PbCl2/[BMMIm]Cl sample shifts downwards to a lower wavenumber of 1583.6 cm−1, whilst that of the CsCl/[BMMIm]Cl sample shows almost no change. The weakened CN bond rightly implies the bonding interaction between the nitrogen atoms in [BMMIm]Cl and uncoordinated Pb2+ (rather than Cs+) lying on the CsPbCl3 surface. The crystallographic property of the non-modified and [BMMIm]Cl-modified CsPbCl3 films are characterized by the XRD patterns as given in Fig. 1d. The obvious peaks at about 15.8°, 22.4°, 32.0°, 35.9°, 39.4°, and 45.9° in each film are assigned to the (100), (101), (200), (201), (211), and (220) planes of the tetragonal CsPbCl3 perovskite (PDF#18-0366), which is a desirable crystal structure for applications in photodetection.1 Both films show a preferential orientation along the (101) plane, in good accordance with the previous report.24 No other peaks can be witnessed, suggesting a high purity of the as-evaporated CsPbCl3 films. Besides, there are almost no distinctions in the peak positions between the pristine and [BMMIm]Cl-modified CsPbCl3 films, demonstrating that the [BMMIm]Cl modification has no negative impact on the CsPbCl3 crystal structure. The slightly enlarged peak intensity of the [BMMIm]Cl-modified CsPbCl3 perovskite corresponds to a higher crystallinity with decreased GB defect densities.49
The impacts of the [BMMIm]Cl modification on the chemical state and electronic structures of the CsPbCl3 perovskites are further investigated by XPS and UPS analyses. It is notable that the peak positions of all the component elements (Cs, Pb, and Cl) shift to the lower binding energies upon [BMMIm]Cl passivation (Fig. 2a–c). The peak positions related to Cs 3d5/2 and Cs 3d3/2 shift from 724.74 and 738.72 eV downwards to 724.38 and 738.38 eV, respectively, while those of the Pb 4f7/2 and Pb 4f5/2 shift from 138.70 and 143.57 eV to 138.41 and 143.27 eV after the introduction of the [BMMIm]Cl layer. The peak positions corresponding to Cl 2p3/2 and Cl 2p1/2 of the [BMMIm]Cl-modified CsPbCl3 film also show declined binding energies of 197.98 and 199.58 eV compared to the non-modified counterpart (198.22 and 199.82 eV). The reduction in binding energies can be mainly ascribed to the increased electron cloud and diminished electron affinity of Pb2+ ions caused by the bond formation between the Pb2+ and electron-rich nitrogen atom in [BMMIm]Cl.49 This result is consistent with the FTIR analysis, cooperatively validating the passivation effect of the [BMMIm]Cl on the halide vacancy defects of the CsPbCl3 film, which is beneficial for the suppression of charge trapping and recombination.
The secondary-electron cutoff energy boundaries (Ecutoff) of the pristine and [BMMIm]Cl-modified CsPbCl3 films derived from the UPS spectra are approximately 16.65 and 16.71 eV (Fig. 2d and e). The work functions (φ) of the two films are 4.57 and 4.51 eV (vs. vacuum), as calculated by the equation of φ = 21.22 − (Ecutoff − Ei).50,51 Here, the value of Ei is set to be 0. The difference between the Fermi level (Ef) and valence band maxima (VBMs) of the [BMMIm]Cl-modified CsPbCl3 films are 2.30 and 2.45 eV, respectively. Correspondingly, the VBMs are estimated as −6.87 and −6.96 eV. The UV-vis absorbance characteristics of the two films are displayed in Fig. 2f. It can be observed that the [BMMIm]Cl-modification merely has a slight influence on the absorption capability of the CsPbCl3 film. The bandgaps of the non-modified and [BMMIm]Cl-modified CsPbCl3 films are 2.99 and 2.98 eV according to the (Ahv)2–hv curves shown in the inset of Fig. 2f. As a result, the conduction band minima (CBMs) of the pristine and PbS [BMMIm]Cl-modified CsPbCl3 films are determined to be −3.88 and −3.98 eV. The Ef of the two films is closer to their CBMs, revealing the n-type nature of the CsPbCl3 film. The resultant energy level alignment of the UV photodetector with a configuration of FTO/CsPbCl3–[BMMIm]Cl/carbon is presented in Fig. 2g. After [BMMIm]Cl passivation, the energy gap between the CBMs of the FTO electrode and CsPbCl3 photosensitive layer is decreased from 0.72 to 0.62 eV, conducive to the electron transfer and extraction process.
The SCLC characterizations are carried out to shed light on the trap-state density (Ntrap) of the non-modified and [BMMIm]Cl-modified CsPbCl3 films. The dark current–voltage (I–V) curves of the testing samples with electron-only architectures are plotted in Fig. 2h and i. The trap-filled limit voltages (VTFL) deduced from the intersection point of the ohmic region (n = 1) and TFL region (n > 3) are 1.64 and 1.48 V for the non-modified and [BMMIm]Cl-modified samples.52 The Ntrap of the films can be determined by the equation:53 (1)where q, ε and ε0 are the elementary charge (∼1.6 × 10−19), vacuum permittivity, and relative dielectric constants of CsPbCl3 (ε ≈ 4.07),21 respectively. The thickness (L) of the CsPbCl3 layer is about 290 nm as unveiled by the cross-sectional SEM image (Fig. S1, ESI†). The Ntrap of the non-modified and [BMMIm]Cl-modified CsPbCl3 films is 8.78 × 1017 and 7.93 × 1017 cm−3. This intuitively confirms the lower defect density of the CsPbCl3 film with [BMMIm]Cl-passivation. The carrier mobility (μ) of the corresponding films can be further extracted through the following equation:54 (2)where JD and V are the dark current and bias voltage. The calculated μ of the pristine and [BMMIm]Cl-modified CsPbCl3 films is 2.09 × 10−3 and 2.87 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The augmented carrier mobility is conducive to the achievement of a faster response speed for the photodetectors.
The top-view SEM images of the non-modified and [BMMIm]Cl-modified CsPbCl3 films are depicted in Fig. 3a and b. It appears that the grains of both the films are compactly arranged and no pinholes can be observed. However, there exists a large number of GBs in the pristine CsPbCl3 film. The GBs in polycrystalline perovskites are generally regarded as the charge recombination center and would cause an undesirable increment in dark current, unfavorable for light detection.55 The width of the GBs becomes narrowed, while the surface gets smoother and more homogeneous after [BMMIm]Cl-modification, validating that the IL molecule is an efficient gap-filler for the CsPbCl3 film. Therefore, the GB-assisted recombination loss tends to be suppressed. As can be seen from the AFM images in Fig. 3c and d, the root-mean-square roughness (RMS) of the [BMMIm]Cl-modified CsPbCl3 film (31.55 nm) is much lower than that of the non-modified counterpart (40.26 nm). The reduced RMS is helpful for forming a better contact between the photosensitive layer and the carbon electrode.

(e) The steady-state PL and (f) TR-PL characteristics of the non-modified and [BMMIm]Cl-modified CsPbCl3 samples deposited onto glass substrates. 
The photoluminescence (PL) measurements are conducted to gain an insight into the charge transfer dynamics of the CsPbCl3 perovskite films. The [BMMIm]Cl-modified CsPbCl3 film exhibits a much stronger steady-state PL emission than the non-modified counterpart (Fig. 3e). Given that no charge transport layer is applied, the luminescence caused by the radiative recombination would be profoundly weakened by the trap-assisted non-radiative recombination.56 The slower quenching of the [BMMIm]Cl-modified CsPbCl3 film certifies the fewer defects in the film. It can also be witnessed that the peak position of the [BMMIm]Cl-passivated film shifts toward a lower wavelength in comparison with the non-modified counterpart, suggesting a lower trap-state density of the former film as well.57 The time-resolved PL (TR-PL) spectra show that the [BMMIm]Cl-modified sample possesses a slower decay process, corresponding to a slower trap-assisted recombination rate. The carrier lifetime (τ) of the pristine and [BMMIm]Cl-modified CsPbCl3 samples fitted from the TR-PL spectra is about 2.97 and 4.84 ns, respectively. The longer carrier lifetime benefits the achievement of a higher charge extraction and collection efficiency, leading to a better photodetection performance. The result of the PL measurement is in good line with that of the SCLC analysis, manifesting the defect passivation effect of [BMMIm]Cl molecule on CsPbCl3 perovskite.
The electronic property of the CsPbCl3 perovskite and CsPbCl3/[BMMIm]Cl hybrid system is further theoretically studied via DFT calculations. The chemical phase diagram of the Cs–Pb–Cl system is illustrated in Fig. S2 (ESI†), while the total energies (Etotal) and other crystal parameters of Cs–Pb–Cl and possible phases are listed in Table S1 (ESI†).48 The calculated Etotal of the pure CsPbCl3 is about −17.62 eV. The surface energy (σ) of CsPbCl3 crystal could be evaluated by the following equation:58 (3)where Esurf and S represent the total energy and area of the surface model, respectively. ni and μi are the number and bulk chemical potential of each element in the model. The optimized lattice parameters and calculated surface energies (σ) of CsPbCl3 perovskite along the different planes are summarized in Table 1. It is apparent that the CsPbCl3 (001) and (110) surfaces exhibit the lowest σ values, indicating the highest stability of the two structures. Thus, the CsPbCl3 (001) and (110) surface models used in this work and the optimized structures of the two models are depicted in Fig. 4a, b and e, f. The interfacial binding energy (ΔE) of the [BMMIm]Cl IL molecule on the CsPbCl3 surface can be calculated by: ΔE = Esurf-IL – [Esurf + EIL](4)where Esurf-IL and EIL are the total energies of [BMMIm]Cl IL adsorbed on the CsPbCl3 surface and the energy of the IL molecule. The ΔE values of the [BMMIm]Cl IL molecule on CsPbCl3 (001) and (110) surface are −1.215 and −1.332 eV, respectively. The negative value of ΔE confirms that the [BMMIm]Cl molecule adsorption on CsPbCl3 surface is an exothermic process, making the structure more stable.59 The bond formation between CsPbCl3 and [BMMIm]Cl can also be deduced from the negative ΔE. The charge density differences of the CsPbCl3 (001)/[BMMIm]Cl and CsPbCl3 (110)/[BMMIm]Cl hybrid model are plotted in Fig. 4d and h to reveal the interfacial charge transport dynamics. For both surfaces, the blue region indicates an electron depletion, and the yellow region reflects an electron accumulation. In specific, the Pb atom in CsPbCl3 interacting with the chloride atom in [BMMIm]Cl acts as an electron donor, while the Pb atom interacting with the imidazole ring in [BMMIm]Cl acts as an electron acceptor. This further corroborates the effective passivation of the uncoordinated Pb2+ by [BMMIm]Cl IL.

Self-powered and charge-transport-layer-free UV photodetectors are constructed based on the [BMMIm]Cl-modified CsPbCl3 films. The abandonment of the expensive or energy-consuming electron/hole transport layers can not only simplify the procedure but also help to cut down the production costs. The response current–time (Iph–t) characteristics of the devices with different concentrations of [BMMIm]Cl IL recorded under 375 nm illumination are given in Fig. 5a and the detailed detection parameters are summarized in Table 2. It can be intuitively observed that all the [BMMIm]Cl-passivated devices deliver augmented current outputs. The currents recorded under UV illumination (Ilight) and dark (Idark) of the pristine CsPbCl3-based device are 1.14 and 8.41 × 10−5 mA (Fig. 5b), yielding a low current on/off ratio of 1.36 × 104 at 0 V bias voltage. The 2.5 mg ml−1 [BMMIm]Cl-modified device shows a much increased Ilight of 2.83 mA (Fig. 5c), stemming from the more efficient charge collection and suppressed trap-assisted recombination loss. The large photocurrent allows the photodetector to actuate the electronic components in the detection system without adding power amplifiers. The Idark of the device is decreased to 1.05 × 10−5 mA, resulting in an ultrahigh on/off ratio of 2.70 × 105. A higher on/off ratio is in favor of improving the anti-interference ability and broadening the application range of the photodetectors. Further raising the concentration of the [BMMIm]Cl IL, the Ilight shows a downward tendency while the Idark exhibits a frustrating upward tendency, yielding a declined on/off ratio (Fig. 5d and e). When the concentration comes to 7.5 mg ml−1, the Idark is even larger than that of the non-modified counterpart, reflecting a higher shot noise and thermal noise in this photodetector.15 The degradation in photodetection performance with higher [BMMIm]Cl concentration may originate from the low conductivity of the thick IL layer, yielding a severe recombination loss. This tendency can also be witnessed in other IL-modified optoelectronic devices.36,49 The dark I–V characteristics (Fig. 5f) of these photodetectors also unveil the lowest dark current level of the 2.5 mg ml−1 [BMMIm]Cl-modified device, affirming the fewest leakage pathways and highest current shunting resistance of the device. This may be attributed to the passivation of the GB defects by [BMMIm]Cl IL as revealed by SEM (Fig. 3b). The more suppressed carrier recombination and trapping of this device also contribute to an alleviated noise current.60

The response time of a photodetector includes the rise time (trise) and fall time (toff), defined as the time required to rise from 10% to 90% or fall from 90% to 10% of the highest point, respectively.61 It is observed that the trise and toff of all these devices are less than 23 ms. Notably, the measured response time here is limited by the resolution of the Keithley source meter. The actual response speed of both the non-modified and [BMMIm]Cl-modified detectors are further recorded via a high-resolution oscilloscope. The testing model is schematically illustrated in Fig. 6a, in which a 375 nm UV light with an intensity of 85.51 mW cm−2 is applied as the excitation signal. The normalized response of the devices to continuously changing UV signals without any bias voltage is depicted in Fig. 6b. The 3 dB cut-off frequencies (f3dB) of the non-modified and [BMMIm]Cl-modified photodetector are around 5 and 20 kHz as estimated from the response vs. frequency characteristics. The higher f3dB of the modified devices unveils their detection capability to higher-frequency UV signals, which is badly needed in UV communications and real-time warning systems. The real ton and toff of the non-modified device recorded under its f3dB are 10.39 and 13.88 μs (Fig. 6c and Fig. S3a, ESI†), while those of the [BMMIm]Cl-modified device are decreased to 1.74 and 1.88 μs at 20 kHz (Fig. 6d and Fig. S3b, ESI†). The shorter response time of the modified device mainly stems from a faster charge injection and collection process.

(e) The typical Iph–t curves and (f) photocurrents of the non-modified and [BMMIm]Cl-modified devices measured under 375 nm UV illumination with changed power intensities. 

R and D* are also important performance metrics of photodetectors. R is regarded as the current output caused by per unit light power, which can be assessed by the following formula:62 (5)where λ and h refer to the light wavelength and Planck constant, respectively. c and e represent the light velocity and elementary charge. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) characteristics of the non-modified and [BMMIm]Cl-modified CsPbCl3 photodetectors are plotted in Fig. S4a (ESI†) with the corresponding R at different wavelengths given in Fig. S4b (ESI†). It is clear that the calculated R of the [BMMIm]Cl-modified device is much larger than that of the non-modified counterpart in the whole spectrum. The highest R of the non-modified and [BMMIm]Cl-modified devices are 0.135 and 0.209 A W−1 obtained at 415 nm. The corresponding D* of these two devices can be further extracted by the following equations:63 (6)where In and f represent the shot noise current and bandwidth, respectively. The In of the non-modified and [BMMIm]Cl-modified devices evaluated from the dark currents (In = (2qIdarkf3dB)1/2) is about 1.16 × 10−11 and 8.20 × 10−12 A Hz−1/2. The f of these two devices is 31.92 and 235.64 kHz according the equation f = 0.443/τ.64 Thus, the calculated D* of the non-modified and [BMMIm]Cl-modified devices are 1.04 × 1012 and 6.19 × 1012 Jones (1 Jones = 1 cm Hz1/2 W−1), respectively. The pronouncedly augmented R and D* mainly originate from the ameliorated charge extraction process after [BMMIm]Cl-passivation, conducive to their applications in ultra-weak light detection.65 Taking all the above discussions into consideration, the device with 2.5 mg ml−1 [BMMIm]Cl-modification demonstrates the best performance. So, the modified devices mentioned hereafter will use 2.5 mg ml−1 [BMMIm]Cl IL as the modification layer. The detection performance of the typical CsPbCl3-based UV photodetectors is listed in Table 3. It can be noted that the as-fabricated [BMMIm]Cl-modified CsPbCl3 photodetector in this work possesses a salient comprehensive performance (together with on/off ratio, response time, R, and D*) among all the CsPbCl3-based counterparts. The large distinctions in the response time of these devices may stem from the varied carrier recombination loss, charge injection speed, and charge transport distance (between two electrodes) as well as charge collection efficiency, which are significantly influenced by the device structures, energy level alignment, quality of the light absorption film, and trap density of the functional layers.

The response properties of the non-modified and [BMMIm]Cl-modified CsPbCl3 photodetectors illuminated by UV signals with changed intensities are displayed in Fig. 6e. Under each light intensity, the [BMMIm]Cl-modified device exhibits an enhanced current output than the non-modified ones at a self-driven mode. The waveforms of both the devices stay rectangle throughout, suggesting a fast photo-switching feature and stable response to wide-range UV signals. The current output (I) as a function of the UV power density is plotted in Fig. 6f. The photocurrents of both the devices increase approximately linearly with the light intensity in the range of 0.01 to 85.51 mW cm−2. The photocurrent vs. power density characteristics can be well fitted by a power function of I∝Pα, where α represents the exponent.66 The α values of the non-modified and [BMMIm]Cl-modified devices are determined to be 0.818 and 0.932. The α value of the latter device is closer to the ideal index of 1, corresponding to a lower energy loss in the light-current conversion process.67 This further verifies a more suppressed trap-assisted recombination loss in the [BMMIm]Cl-modified device.
The UV irradiation, moisture and thermal stabilities are also crucial factors for UV photodetectors. The Iph–t characteristics of the unencapsulated non-modified and [BMMIm]Cl-modified detectors under successive 375 nm UV illumination (Fig. 7a) reveal that both the devices possess an excellent UV irradiation durability. After 10000 s (∼2.78 h) illumination in air, the photocurrent of the non-modified device only shows a decline of ∼9%, which may be ascribed to the UV-accelerated non-radiative recombination loss. In comparison, the [BMMIm]Cl-modified device even obtains an improved current output. This operational stability is better than that of the same-type CsPbCl3 UV photodetectors.15,21,25 After being placed in air (relative humidity ∼30%) for 720 h, there is almost no degradation in the performance of both the devices (Fig. 7b). The excellent moisture stability mainly originates from the high chemical stability of CsPbCl3 itself and the protection from the hydrophobic carbon electrode. The non-modified device maintains 94.8% of its initial photocurrent when under thermal attack at 85 °C for 72 h, while the [BMMIm]Cl-modified device can retain 99.5% of its initial performance (Fig. 7c). The thermal stability of the [BMMIm]Cl-modified devices with carbon electrode are much augmented compared to the other CsPbCl3-based photodetectors using Ag electrode.16 The bad thermal stability of the Ag electrode-based devices mainly originates from the reaction between the migrated Cl− and the noble metal electrode. According to the above analysis, the [BMMIm]Cl modification contributes to elevated comprehensive durability of the CsPbCl3 photodetectors, favorable for their practical applications under severe conditions.

(d) The EIS spectra of the non-modified and [BMMIm]Cl-modified CsPbCl3 photodetectors. 
Eventually, the interfacial charge recombination dynamics of the non-modified and [BMMIm]Cl-modified CsPbCl3 photodetectors are researched by EIS measurements in dark conditions. It can be witnessed that only one arc exists in each Nyquist plot (Fig. 7d), which is more relevant to the carrier recombination behavior in the FTO/CsPbCl3 interface and corresponds to a recombination resistance (Rrec).36 The calculated Rec of [BMMIm]Cl-modified device is about 925 Ω, much higher than that of the non-modified one (∼427 Ω). The higher Rec would provoke a decreased non-radiative recombination rate and set obstacles to current leakage, beneficial for improving the R and D*. The series resistance (Rs) of the [BMMIm]Cl-modified detector is also declined from 48.2 to 38.4 Ω as extracted from the starting point in the real part of their Nyquist plots. This may result from the improved surface evenness of the [BMMIm]Cl-modified CsPbCl3 film (Fig. 3d), yielding a lower interfacial charge accumulation.
4. Conclusions
In this study, we demonstrate a defect passivation strategy using [BMMIm]Cl IL for the fabrication of high-performance CsPbCl3 UV photodetectors. Experimental characterizations and DFT calculations have validated that the introduction of the [BMMIm]Cl layer can effectively passivate the chloride vacancies of the CsPbCl3 polycrystalline film by bond formation between the [BMMIm]Cl molecule and CsPbCl3. The [BMMIm]Cl modification also helps to passivate the GB defects and bring down the CBM of the CsPbCl3 photosensitive layer, leading to a reduced dark current level and interfacial energy barrier. These all are conducive to the charge extraction and collection process as well as the suppression of the charge trapping and recombination loss. Consequently, the [BMMIm]Cl-modified devices obtain a profoundly promoted UV detection performance. The best-performing photodetector with an optimized [BMMIm]Cl concentration of 2.5 mg ml−1 achieves an ultrahigh on/off ratio of 2.70 × 105 as well as a prominent R and D* of 0.209 A W−1 and 6.19 × 1012 Jones at 0 V bias, respectively. This comprehensive performance is comparable to that of any other reported CsPbCl3-based photodetectors. The [BMMIm]Cl-modified devices also deliver enhanced UV irradiation, moisture and thermal stabilities in favor of their practical applications. In addition, the overall production costs of the devices are controlled in a low level by abandoning the utilization of electron/hole transport layers and expensive noble metal electrodes. Our work provides a feasible and promising way to passivate the defects of wide-bandgap CsPbCl3 perovskites, facilitating their potential applications in state-of-the-art, low-cost and high-speed UV detection systems.
