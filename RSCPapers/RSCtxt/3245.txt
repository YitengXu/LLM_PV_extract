    , Accepted 13th November 2019First published on 15th November 2019AbstractAll-inorganic perovskite CsPbI2Br usually requires a high fabrication temperature (higher than 200 °C) and suffers from an unwanted phase transition from a photo-active cubic phase to a photo-inactive orthorhombic phase. Here, we demonstrate an effective anti-solvent-free route to simultaneously stabilize the cubic phase and lower the fabrication temperature of perovskite solar cells with guanidinium (GA) cation doping. It is suggested that a trace amount of GA in the precursor could enter the substitutional sites to stabilize the cubic phase by relaxing the lattice strain and forming strong hydrogen bonds. State-of-the-art in situ grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurements reveal that GA could advance the crystallization of the cubic phase, indicating that the formation of the perovskite cubic phase experiences a lowered energy barrier with the assistance of GA, thereby resulting in a significant decrease of the fabrication temperature. An efficiency as high as 14.34% was achieved at a low fabrication temperature of 140 °C. With the help of GA, the device maintains ∼94% of its initial efficiency after being stored for 1000 h.
1. Introduction
Organic–inorganic perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted tremendous attention with the rapidly increasing power conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 24% to date.1 However, organic–inorganic PSCs suffer from stability issues, especially thermal stability, because of the relatively high volatility of commonly employed organic cations such as methylammonium (MA) and formamidinium (FA).2–4 Hence, all-inorganic PSCs emerge as a viable solution to address the thermal stability issue by substituting the organic cations with inorganic cations, i.e., Cs+. On the other hand, the much smaller inorganic cations largely reduce the value of the tolerance factor beyond the desired cubic phase range (0.9–1).5 For instance, the cubic phase of CsPbI3, though with a suitable band gap (Eg) of 1.7 eV for photovoltaic applications, is not stable at room temperature.6–9
To stabilize the cubic phase of Cs-based all-inorganic PSCs, one popular way is to use PbI2·xDMAI (x = 1.1 to 1.2; DMAI, dimethylammonium iodide) as the precursor additive, which remarkably pushed the PCE of CsPbI3 PSCs over 18% recently.10 Another effective route is to employ smaller halide anions, such as Br+, which, however, further enlarges the bandgap.11 For instance, CsPbBr3 was reported to have a stable black orthorhombic phase at room temperature but a too large Eg of 2.4 eV to sufficiently absorb sunlight.12 Therefore, mixed halide Cs-based PSCs were proposed to balance the bandgap range and the phase stability.13 Among the reported mixed halide Cs-based PSCs, CsPbI2Br with a bandgap of 1.9 eV is one of the most extensively studied compositions with over 16% PCEs reported.14 However, it still suffers from the unwanted phase transition from the photo-active cubic phase to the photo-inactive orthorhombic phase at room temperature. Li et al. found that devices based on CsPbI2Br perovskite showed a dramatically degraded photovoltaic performance after 10 min under humidity conditions. They ascribed it to the extremely unstable α-phase CsPbI2Br in a high relative humidity (RH), leading to the color change of the films.15 Han et al. pointed out that pure CsPbI2Br tends to transit to the photoinactive δ-phase at room temperature, harming the light harvesting and charge transport.16
For most of the all-inorganic high-efficiency perovskite solar cells, a high fabrication temperature over 200 °C is often required. These energy-consuming processes are not favorable for mass production.17,18 There are very limited approaches developed so far capable of effectively lowering the fabrication temperature below 200 °C, but at the cost of PCE decrease.42 For instance, DMSO assisted annealing treatment was developed to control the perovskite crystallization and produced CsPbI2Br PSCs with a 10.4% PCE with a fabrication temperature of 120 °C.19 A synthesized Lewis base adduct allowed a low activation energy route to form CsPbI2Br perovskite films and achieved a PCE of 13.54% with a fabrication temperature of 120 °C.20 Thus, the search of low-temperature fabrication strategies for all-inorganic perovskite systems is highly desirable.
In this work, we present a brand-new method to fabricate high-efficiency CsPbI2Br PSCs with enhanced phase stability at a low temperature through organic guanidinium cation (C(NH2)3), i.e. GA, doping. Furthermore, our method is anti-solvent free, providing another advantage for future mass production. In comparison to the MA and FA cations, GA has three symmetric amino groups that contribute to the formation of more hydrogen bonds, which play a key role in structural stabilization. The atomic-level evidence confirmed that GA could be directly incorporated into the MAPbI3 and FAPbI3 lattices, forming pure GAxMA1−xPbI3 or GAxFA1−xPbI3 phases.21 On the other hand, unlike the bulky long-chain BA or PEA cations, GA has a moderate size to fit into the lattice without impeding the carrier transport.22,23,44 GA cations were previously employed in the MAPbI3 system to improve the material stability by partially substituting the MA organic cations.24,43 Some theory calculations pointed out that GA can effectively stiffen the inorganic Pb–I lattice and reduce formation of defects.25 It was reported that (FA,Cs)Pb(I,Br)3 perovskites get enhanced defect tolerance and phase stability via GA alloying.26 Guanidinium thiocyanate (GASCN) was introduced into Sn–Pb mixed perovskite films to improve the structural and optoelectronic properties via the formation of two-dimensional (2D) structures at grain boundaries.27 It is indeed very difficult to conclude whether GA cations are inserted into the lattice or passivate grain boundaries, which may depend on the perovskite composition, fabrication method, GA additive concentration, etc. Here, we demonstrate that only a trace amount (∼0.5 mol%) of GA could simultaneously stabilize the cubic phase and lower the fabrication temperature of all-inorganic CsPbI2Br. Based on the X-ray diffraction (XRD), fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results, it is evident that GA could enter the substitutional sites of Cs to relax the lattice strain created by the small Cs cations and form strong hydrogen bonds with the neighboring [PbI6]4− octahedral building blocks to suppress the phase transition from the cubic phase (α-phase) to orthorhombic phase (δ-phase) (Fig. 1a). Furthermore, state-of-the-art in situ grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurements reveal the kinetic role of GA in expediting the formation of the CsPbI2Br cubic phase. It implies that the energy barrier to form the cubic phase is significantly lowered by the incorporation of GA, thus allowing a much lower fabrication temperature. In addition, a surface treatment with GABr could further passivate the perovskite surface defects and better orient the crystals. A PCE as high as 14.34% is achieved with a fabrication temperature of 140 °C. To our knowledge, it is the highest efficiency reported among the CsPbI2Br PSCs fabricated at a low temperature (<150 °C). Specifically, the device with GA retains 94% of its initial efficiency after being stored for 1000 h under nitrogen conditions.

2. Results and discussion
First, we demonstrate the effectiveness of GA doping in stabilizing the CsPbI2Br film. GA cations were introduced into the CsPbI2Br precursor solution by adding a trace amount (0.5 mol%) of the GAPbI2Br solution in order to maintain the perovskite stoichiometric ratio and eliminate the effect from the I/Br ratio variation. Fig. 1b shows the comparison of the CsPbI2Br films with and without GA stored in dry air for 24 hours. Apparently, the film without GA degrades severely with the appearance of a lot of color fading areas, while the film with GA shows a uniform black color. XRD measurements were carried out to identify the phase composition of the film. As shown in Fig. 1c, both fresh films exhibit three main Bragg peaks at 2θ = 14.6°, 20.8° and 29.3° which are indexed as the (100), (110), and (200) planes of the perovskite pseudo cubic α-phase, respectively.28 For the aged films without GA, the XRD spectrum exhibits strong Bragg peaks of the orthorhombic δ-phase, indicating that the cubic phase of CsPbI2Br is unstable.29 In contrast, the aged film with GA shows much less and weaker δ-phase signals, consistent with the film appearance. The XRD pattern of the pure GAPbI2Br film is included in ESI Fig. S1.† The absence of GAPbI2Br diffraction peaks in the CsPbI2Br film with GA confirms that no obvious heterogeneous phase segregation was produced by the GA doping. Furthermore, the (100) peak position shifts slightly to a lower diffraction angle, suggesting that the relatively larger GA cations enter the substitutional sites of Cs+ causing a lattice expansion. Such a lattice expansion could compensate with the lattice distortion caused by the small Cs+, being critical to stabilize the α-phase. Therefore, the stoichiometric solutions of GAPbI2Br used in our work are mainly aiding the thin films by inclusion into the lattice. In addition, the film crystallinity is further enhanced by adding GA in the light of decreased peak width of the (100) peak from 0.129° to 0.125° after GA doping.
FTIR measurements were performed to detect the existence of GA in the perovskite film by probing the stretching vibration of the functional groups (Fig. 2a). Compared to the film without GA, the film with GA exhibits three vibrational peaks located at 1640, 1410 and 1315 cm−1, corresponding to the vibration of N–H, C–N, and C–H bonds, signifying the existence of the organic GA cations in the film.30 These functional group peaks are consistent with those detected from the pure GAPbI2Br (Fig. S2†). XPS measurements were carried out in the N 1s, I 3d and Br 3d regions (Fig. 2b–d) to further confirm the presence of GA and to understand its interaction with halide atoms. An N 1s signal was detected in the film with GA, but not in the film without GA, as expected. All the spin–orbital doublet peaks of I (3d3/2 and 3d5/2) and Br (3d3/2 and 3d5/2) shift slightly to stronger binding energy with the addition of GA. We attribute this to the hydrogen bonds formed between the three amino groups of GA and halide anions. It was reported that the positively charged (δ+) ammonium H atom and negatively charged (δ−) halide atom tend to form hydrogen bonds, such as N–H+⋯I− and N–H+⋯Br−.24,31–33 The incorporation of GA increases the number of H bonds compared with the small Cs cation, thus reducing the H–I or H–Br distance and inducing the XPS peak shift.43 The corresponding schematic of hydrogen bonding interaction between GA+ and the lead-halide framework is illustrated in Fig. S3.†

In situ grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) was employed to investigate the role of GA in the CsPbI2Br crystallization process during spin coating. The measurements were performed with an incidence angle of 2°. The peak located at qz = 1.85 Å−1 originates from the substrate, implying the full penetration of the source beam to probe the bulk structure of the film.34Fig. 3a and d present the intensity profiles along the qz direction for the CsPbI2Br films without and with GA, accompanied by the false-color intensity maps versus qz and frame numbers (3 s per frame) in Fig. 3b and e. The corresponding time evolution of the area of the scattering peaks at qz = 1.04 Å−1 and 0.72 Å−1 is shown in Fig. 3c and f to signify the overall crystallinity of the black α-phase and yellow δ-phase, respectively. The whole process can be divided into three stages: (I) the solution stage; (II) the crystal growth stage; (III) the crystallinity saturation stage. For the film without GA (Fig. 3b), stage II begins at the ∼60th frame with three scattering peaks appearing at qz = 1.04, 1.45 and 2.06 Å−1, which are indexed to the (100), (110), and (200) planes of the cubic phase respectively and lasts for ∼25 frames (∼75 s) before saturation. The yellow δ-phase emerges in stage III, indicated by the appearance of a tiny scattering peak at qz = 0.72 Å−1. Remarkably, the addition of GA could give rise to a much earlier initiation of the perovskite crystallization at the ∼30th frame (Fig. 3e). Besides, it takes much shorter time (∼10 frames/30 s) to reach the comparable crystallinity, compared with the film without GA. The film remains in the pure α-phase without the unwanted phase transition to δ-phase in stage III. The (100) peak area of the film with GA is also larger than that without GA, suggesting that the incorporation of GA could enhance the overall crystallinity of the α-phase. Together, it is suggested that GA could advance and strengthen the CsPbI2Br cubic phase and suppress the phase transition to the yellow phase. The corresponding schematic of the crystallization process is illustrated in Fig. 3g.

A facile low-temperature process without the antisolvent procedure was developed to fabricate high quality CsPbI2Br films. As illustrated in Fig. 4a, the spin-coated film was annealed at a low temperature of 40 °C for 1 min and a high temperature of 140 °C for 10 min. Subsequently, the film was treated with the GABr solution to passivate the surface by inducing a secondary crystal growth without introducing foreign ions.35 The resulted film was very smooth and mirror-like. Fig. 4c shows a photo of the 25 cm2 mirror-like perovskite film produced with this process to demonstrate its capability in large-scale device fabrication. The ultraviolet-visible absorption (UV-vis) and photoluminescence (PL) spectra were measured to study the optical properties of the CsPbI2Br films (Fig. 4d). The absorption of the pure GAPbI2Br film is shown in Fig. S4† as a reference. For all the films, the optical bandgap estimated from the absorption edge is ∼1.9 eV (∼642 nm), in agreement with the theoretical bandgap of CsPbI2Br.13 It suggests that doping with GA in the precursor solution and through the surface passivation has negligible effects on the optical bandgap, which is also supported by the unchanged PL peak position at 642 nm. On the other hand, both treatments could give rise to a certain degree of PL quenching for the perovskite film coated on the ZnO electron transporting layer (ETL), demonstrating their influence on promoting the charge collection.36,37

To correlate the effects of GA doping with the device performance, we fabricated solar cells with a device structure of ITO/ZnO/perovskite (∼500 nm)/Spiro-OMeTAD/Au. Fig. 4b shows a cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of a typical device. The champion current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the devices based on the perovskite film without or with GA in the precursor solution and with GA in both the precursor and passivation are plotted in Fig. 4e. The detailed device characteristics are summarized in Table 1. The best PCE of 14.34% was achieved for the film with GA and passivation, showing an open-circuit voltage Voc of 1.19 V, a short-circuit current density Jsc of 15.8 mA cm−2 and a fill-factor FF of 76.21%. The statistics of device parameters are shown in Fig. S5 and Table S1.† Compared with the control devices, the GA doped devices demonstrate enhanced Voc and FF, indicating that the incorporation of GA could reduce the charge recombination.38 The annealing temperature is also optimized (Fig. S6 and Table S2†). We reviewed previously reported PCEs of low-temperature-fabricated CsPbI2Br PSCs (Table S3†), as presented in Fig. 4f. It indicates that our result is among the best in this catalog.13,39 The corresponding references for the reference points are shown in the ESI.†

The charge recombination mechanism of the corresponding films was investigated by the light intensity dependence of Voc, as shown in Fig. 4g. We calculated the ideality factor n from the formula  where kB is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature, q is the electric charge and I is the light intensity.18 We found that the film without GA shows an n of 2.52, while the n of the films with GA and with GA & passivation is 1.87 and 1.75, respectively. The smaller value of n implies that trap-assisted Shockley-Read-Hall (SRH) recombination can be effectively suppressed by doping with GA in the precursor and surface passivation, in agreement with the observed increase in Voc and FF.40
A series of photographs of the CsPbI2Br films with and without GA for different amounts of time durations under ambient conditions with around 50% relative humidity are shown in Fig. S7.† It is obvious that the CsPbI2Br film with GA experiences much slower degradation than the control film without GA. The long-term stability of the devices was examined by storing them in a glovebox for 1000 hours. As shown in Fig. 4h, the device without GA degraded quickly. With the help of GA, the devices retained ∼94% of their initial PCE. We attribute the enhanced long-term stability to the phase stability enhanced by the incorporation of GA into the cubic phase lattice.
The surface and bulk morphology of the CsPbI2Br films without GA, with GA, and with GA & passivation was further studied by SEM and GIWAXS measurements. In Fig. 5a, the film without GA has a rough surface with inhomogeneous crystal domains. In contrast, the films with GA (Fig. 5b) show uniformly packed crystalline grains. Fig. 5d–f present the two-dimensional (2D) GIWAXS patterns of the films. And the corresponding intensity profiles in the qz direction and the polar angle (χ) along the (110) ring are shown in Fig. 5h and i, respectively. All the films exhibit clear perovskite cubic phase scattering peaks with the (100) plane preferentially oriented in the out-of-plane direction, indicating that our annealing process could promote the stacking of the corner-sharing [PbI6]4− octahedra in the vertical direction, being beneficial for the charge transport.27 The crystallinity and orientational order could be further enhanced by adding GA in the precursor solution and surface passivation (Fig. 5i and g), manifested by the increase of the scattering intensity and the narrowing polar angle peak width. The better morphology, crystallinity and orientational order of the perovskite film with GA could be the main reason for the overall Voc and FF enhancement. It is worth noting that a tiny peak at qz = 0.7 Å−1 appeared in the film with GA & passivation. It is assigned to the formation of 1D GAPbI2Br due to the surface passivation process.41 The SEM and 2D GIWAXS results of the pure GAPbI2Br film are shown in Fig. S8.† GAPbI2Br shows a rod-like morphology, which might explain the enhanced orientational order of the resultant perovskite phase. The slight decrease of Voc after the GABr treatment could be caused by the formation of 1D GAPbI2Br on the perovskite film surface.

3. Conclusions
In conclusion, we have demonstrated that introducing GA cations could effectively improve the structural stability and device performance of CsPbI2Br PSCs. A PCE as high as 14.34% has been achieved with an industry-friendly low-temperature and antisolvent-free fabrication process. The GA-doped device retains 94% of its initial efficiency after being stored for 1000 h under nitrogen conditions. The characterization results suggest that the incorporation of GA could promote the formation of the α-phase and increase the crystallinity and orientational order of the resultant films. The reason for this is that GA could lower the energy barrier to form the cubic phase, which is supported by the in situ GIWAXS results that the perovskite phase is formed much earlier with the GA doping. This is also in agreement with the fact that only a low temperature is required in the device fabrication. Hence, this work not only provides a facile way to improve the structural stability and efficiency of all-inorganic PSCs, but also uncovers the underlying mechanism of large organic cations in promoting the crystallization process of the perovskite α-phase.
