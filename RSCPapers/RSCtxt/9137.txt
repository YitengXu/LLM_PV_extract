    , Accepted 27th February 2018First published on 28th February 2018AbstractLarge area fabrication of organic solar cells is critical to achieve sufficient energy for power applications. However, large-area organic solar cells still suffer from low production yields because their thin active layer (100–300 nm) is prone to form leakage current when film defects exist in the active layer. In this study, we proposed a novel strategy to patch the defects to suppress the leakage current and improve the device yield of large-area organic solar cells. The defects in the active layers have been patched by coating an insulating polymer using a Maobi tool that has the advantage of patterning and ink holding. Insulating polymers including polyethylenimine (PEI), polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), and polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) have been used to patch the defects. Electrical insulativity, solution processability, solvent orthogonality to the active layer, good wetting on the active layer, and chemical inactivity with the active layer and interfacial layer are important properties for a good candidate used for patching the defects. The patching strategy is applicable to both fullerene-based and non-fullerene-based solar cells and can effectively restore the photovoltaic properties of the active layers with defects. Finally, we have demonstrated the construction of large-area (up to 52 cm2) monolithic none-fullerene organic solar cells with the assistance of the proposed patching strategy.
1. Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) hold advantages of easy fabrication, lightweight, good mechanical flexibility, and easy demonstration of vivid colors that can lead to significant economic potentials.1–7 However, area scale-up remains an important challenge towards the industrialization of this technology because of low device yields of the large-area OSCs.8–10 Due to limited exciton diffusion length and carrier mobility, the optimized thickness of the active layer in OSCs is typically less than 200 nm. A thicker active layer is favored, but only a few of the material systems reported in the literature claim a decent FF value with thicknesses exceeding 300 nm.11–17 The integrity of this ultra-thin film is thus prone to be disrupted by defects from the substrates (e.g. the protrusions in indium tin oxide, ITO) or introduced by particles or contaminants present in the environment or additional manufacturing-related causes such as printing-head failure, dewetting, and handling damage.18,19 The missing active layer in the portion of defects would result in the direct contact of the top and bottom electrodes (as demonstrated in Fig. 1a). This will lead to a low shunt resistance and a large leakage current and therefore yield a low open-circuit voltage (VOC), fill factor (FF), and power conversion efficiency (PCE). In particular, the probability of defect occurrence exponentially increases with the area of the device.9 It is quite challenging to fabricate large-area organic solar cells with a high device yield. Therefore, a strategy that can repair or patch up the defects to increase the device yield of large-area solar cells is highly desirable.

In literature, there are limited studies on the repair of defects.8 Oostra and Jasper et al.19–21 used aqueous sodium hypochlorite to locally oxidize the poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) electrode, lowering its conductivity by over eight orders of magnitude to insulate the contact between the top electrode and the bottom electrode in the defect region. The short circuits due to defects in the organic layer of organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) and OSCs are thus prevented. The chemical strategy to inactivate or insulate the layers requires the presence of particular chemical units to react with the oxidizing agent. They also tried to deposit a thicker (>1.5 nm) LiF layer to maintain the loss of shunt resistance caused by defects and demonstrated that device performance was not negatively affected as long as the shunt resistance was higher than approximately 1000 Ohm.22 This requires very fine control of the LiF layer during thermal deposition since LiF is an electrical-insulating material.
Hence, we report a physical method to patch the defects in the organic active layers by coating solution-processed insulating polymers using a Maobi tool (Fig. 1a). Maobi, also called Chinese ink brush, made of animal hairs, is a Chinese traditional painting/writing tool.23 It has unique advantages of patterning and ink holding that are suitable for selective coating in a particular defect area. Insulating polymers including polyethylenimine (PEI), polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), and polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) have been used to patch the defects. Their chemical structures are shown in Fig. 1b. Electric insulativity, solution processability, solvent orthogonality to the active layer, good wetting on the active layer, and chemical inactivity with the active layer and interfacial layer are important properties for good candidates used to patch the defects. After coating the insulating polymers onto the defect area, the photovoltaic parameters, particularly the VOC and FF, of the solar cells can be almost fully restored even when the defect area deliberately created is up to 20% of the whole device area. The patch strategy is applicable to both fullerene (P3HT:ICBA-based) and non-fullerene (PBDB-T:ITIC-based) solar cells. Finally, we have demonstrated the construction of large-area monolithic solar cells and solar modules with the assistance of this patching strategy.
2. Results and discussion
2.1. Patching up the defects in the organic active layer for solar cell applications

Fig. 1a shows the patching process of the defects in the active layers using a Maobi tool. Before patching, the defects in the active layer would result in the direct contact of the top and the bottom electrodes that would significantly decrease the shunt resistance and efficiency of the solar cell. After patching with an insulating layer, the two electrodes will be isolated by the insulating polymers (PEI, PVA or PMMA, Fig. 1b). This would maintain the shunt resistance and thus would help to maintain the photovoltaic properties of the devices.
To illustrate how the defects influence the solar cell performance, we have deliberately introduced defects with different areas on the active layers. Fig. 2a shows an image of the 9 fabricated devices (Glass/ITO/ZnO/poly[(2,6-(4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)-benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene))-alt-(5,5-(1′,3′-di-2-thienyl-5′,7′-bis(2-ethylhexyl)benzo[1′,2′-c:4′,5′-c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione))] (PBDB-T):3,9-bis(2-methylene-(3-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)-indanone))-5,5,11,11-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)-dithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene) (ITIC)/MoO3/Ag: a reference device without defects and eight devices with 1–15 mm2 defects deliberately created on 1.6 (1.6 × 1.0) cm2 active layers prior to the deposition of the top electrode (MoO3/Ag). Fig. 2b shows their current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics under 100 mW cm−2 AM1.5 illumination. Their photovoltaic parameters are summarised in Table 1. The reference cell (without defects in the active layer) displays photovoltaic performance: VOC = 0.84 V, JSC = 14.7 mA cm−2, FF = 0.58, and PCE = 7.2%. When combined with a rectification ratio over 102 in the dark J–V characteristics at ±2 V (Fig. 2d), high quality of the reference device with the area of 1.6 cm2 was achieved. When defects appear inside the active layer, the device performance degrades rapidly as a function of the device area (Fig. 2b and c). When the defect area is 1 mm2 out of 1.6 cm2, the PCE decreases to nearly 25% that of the reference cell. The rapid decrease was mainly due to reduction in the VOC and FF because of a significant loss in the shunt resistance. The dark current (Fig. 2d) shows that the devices with defects almost do not show rectification behavior as a diode. Thus, the performance of the solar cells is very sensitive to the defects in the active layer.

To repair the defects and maintain the shunt resistance, we proposed to selectively coat insulating polymers to passivate the defects using a Maobi tool.24–27 Recently, we have demonstrated fully writable organic solar cells, including the active layer and electrodes, using the Maobi tool.23 The Maobi tool can form target patterns and realize selective coating in a particular target area. Fig. 3 shows the J–V characteristics of the devices (1.6 cm2), where the defects (from 1 to 24 mm2) are patched by a coating of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) using the Maobi tool. Their photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 2. As shown in the inset of Fig. 3a, all the devices with the patched defects show comparable VOC and FF values to those of the reference device. Even when the defect area was 24 mm2, 15% of the total active area, the repaired device still retained a high VOC of 0.81 V and an FF of 0.56. As shown in Fig. 3b, these devices with repaired active layers show good rectification. The shunt resistance loss was effectively restrained. The degradation in JSC was attributed to the loss of the actual effective working area with an increase in the defect area patched by the insulating PVA coating. Therefore, the proposed patching strategy was effective to repair the flawed active layer and restore its photovoltaic performance.

2.2. Selection criteria of the materials for the patching up method
The selection of the materials used to patch up the active layer is important towards effectively restoring the photovoltaic performance of the active layer. First, the material has to be electric insulating since it is used to insulate the defects and isolate the direct contact between the top and bottom electrodes. Second, the material should be soluble in orthogonal solvents to the active layer materials. In our first attempt to patch the defects in P3HT:ICBA devices with the structure Glass/ITO/PEI/poly(3-hexylthiophene)(P3HT):indene-C60 bis-adduct (ICBA)/MoO3/Ag, we chose PEI (branched polyethylenimine whose molecular structure is shown in Fig. 1b) as the patching material. PEI is an insulator with a large band gap of 6.2 eV and has been widely used as a low-work function modifier with an ultrathin thickness (<10 nm, typically processed from the low concentration of 0.1–0.4 wt%).28,29 A thicker PEI (or some other interfacial materials) layer on the electrode would result in the deteriorated performance of the solar cells.30 PEI is soluble in alcohol (for example, isopropanol, IPA) that is orthogonal to the active layer. Coating a PEI solution (in IPA) on the active layer would not dissolve the organic active layer that is typically soluble in chlorobenzene or dichlorobenzene. To patch up the defects, a high concentration (10 wt% in IPA) was prepared to produce a thicker PEI (>100 nm) coating as an electric insulating layer. The high viscosity of the concentrated PEI solution was also beneficial to the PEI coating on the defect area. The patching solution has good wetting properties on the active layer (Fig. S1a†). Fig. 4a shows the J–V characteristics under illumination of the solar cells (Glass/ITO/PEI/P3HT:ICBA/MoO3/Ag) with an effective area of 50 mm2: one comprising a 5 mm2 deliberately created defect and the other comprising a defect with the same area but patched up by a PEI layer via Maobi-coating. The defected cell yields VOC = 0.08 V, JSC = 7.2 mA cm−2, FF = 0.25, and PCE = 0.2%. The cell with the PEI-patched defect exhibits VOC = 0.80 V, JSC = 8.3 mA cm−2, FF = 0.53, and PCE = 3.5%. The J–V characteristics in the dark were also determined and are plotted in Fig. S2.† The cell with the patched defect shows a high rectification ratio and small reverse saturation current. It can be argued that these deliberately created defects may not be the exact case that happens in real devices. Thus, we used an example of an active layer where the defects formed in the active layer were three comet tail-shaped defects (Fig. S3a†). Prior to the deposition of the top electrode (MoO3/Ag), these defects were patched up using PEI via Maobi-coating. The repaired cell (1.6 cm2) exhibits VOC = 0.81 V, JSC = 7.1 mA cm−2, FF = 0.53, and PCE = 3.0%. The VOC and JSC are comparable to those of the reference devices with a similar device area. The leakage current was also effectively suppressed in the J–V characteristics in the dark (Fig. S3b†). These results demonstrate the effectiveness of using PEI as a patching material to patch up the defects in the P3HT:ICBA active layer.
 Fig. 4  The J–V characteristics under illumination: (a) solar cells (Glass/ITO/PEI/P3HT:ICBA/MoO3/Ag) where the active area is 50 mm2 with a 5 mm2 artificial defect; one without patching and the other one patched up using PEI. (b) Solar cells (Glass/ITO/ZnO/PBDB-T:ITIC/MoO3/Ag) where the active area is 50 mm2 with a 5 mm2 artificial defect; one without patching and the other one patched using by PEI; (c) one without patching and the other one patched up using PVA; (d) one without patching and the other one patched up using PMMA. The device structure in (b–d) is the same but patched using PEI, PVA, and PMMA, respectively. 
However, when we tried this method with the PEI patching material to repair a PBDB-T:ITIC active layer, problems arose. On a 50 mm2 active layer, 5 mm2 defects were patched using the PEI coating. Without patching, the cell with the structure Glass/ITO/ZnO/PBDB-T:ITIC/MoO3/Ag shows VOC = 0.14 V, JSC = 12.5 mA cm−2, FF = 0.25, and PCE = 0.4% (Fig. 4b). After PEI patching, the cell exhibits VOC = 0.62 V, JSC = 13.4 mA cm−2, FF = 0.42, and PCE = 3.5%. The PEI patching improved the performance as compared to that of the unpatched cell; however, its performance (particularly VOC and FF) was still significantly lower than that of the reference cell without any defects (VOC = 0.85 V, JSC = 15.7 mA cm−2, FF = 0.63, and PCE = 8.4%, as shown in Fig. S4†). It can be seen that on the sample (the inset of Fig. 4b), the patched area changed from dark blue to yellowish. A chemical reaction occurs between PEI and ITIC. The amine group in PEI reacts as a nucleophile with the CO moiety in ITIC that destroys the original electronic structure and intramolecular charge transfer of the ITIC molecules.31 The absorption from the intramolecular charge transfer of ITIC also disappears; this leads to the color change. The corresponding J–V characteristics in the dark are shown in Fig. S5.† The PEI patching suppresses the current at the reverse bias as compared to the case of the unpatched cell, but not as low as that of the reference devices without defects at a low positive bias (0–0.8 V). Therefore, chemical inactivity of the patching materials is another important criterion besides the insulating nature and solubility in orthogonal solvents.
In this regard, we chose PVA instead of PEI to patch up the defects in the PBDB-T:ITIC film. PVA is a non-toxic and water-soluble polymer (its molecular structure is shown in Fig. 1b). It has been used in organic thin-film transistors (OTFTs) as a gate dielectric insulator and also as a low permeability barrier material for encapsulation in organic solar cells.32–35 Since PVA is dissolved in water and the surface of photoactive layer is hydrophobic, a non-ionic surfactant (PEG-TmDD) is added to lower the contact angle of PVA on PBDB-T:ITIC, as shown in Fig. S1b.† The inset in Fig. 4c illustrates an image of the defected film patched with PVA. The cell (50 mm2) with a defect (5 mm2) patched using PVA yields VOC = 0.83 V, JSC = 13.9 mA cm−2, FF = 0.63, and PCE = 7.3% (Fig. 4c), indicating that the defect is effectively patched and the performance is well restored. The image in Fig. S6† demonstrates that the defects can be well patched, even if they have an irregular shape (as in WNLO), by PVA using the Maobi tool. This is because of the excellent patterning advantage of the Maobi tool, which is typically used as a writing or painting tool. PMMA (polymethylmethacrylate whose molecular structure is shown in Fig. 1b, and the contact angle of the PMMA in acetone solution on PBDB-T:ITIC is shown in Fig. S1c†) is also used. The results shown in Fig. 4d indicate that PMMA can also effectively repair the defect and restore the performance.
2.3. Large-area organic solar modules and monolithic cells fabricated with the assistance of the patching method
We have shown that the patching strategy can effectively passivate the defects and enhance the device yield. Thus, we further applied it to fabricate large-area solar cells and modules. At first, cells with an area of 8 (3.2 × 2.5) cm2 were fabricated (device structure: Glass/ITO/ZnO/PBDB-T:ITIC/MoO3/Ag). Fig. 5a shows an image of one of the fabricated devices that has been obtained from the glass/ITO side. It can be seen that a defect is formed during spin coating with an area of 6 mm2 and patched up using PMMA. The cell shows a photovoltaic performance of VOC = 0.85 V, JSC = 13.0 mA cm−2, FF = 0.54, and PCE = 6.0% under AM1.5 100 mA cm−2 illumination. The production yield of these cells was very high; ten devices were fabricated with almost no loss in the VOC, and the average PCE was 5.8%. The typical PCE of a very small cell (4 mm2) is above 9%, and the decreased performance (about 30%) is associated with the increased series resistance from ITO over a large area. If the area continues to increase, the efficiency will continue to degrade. Thus, metal bus bars have to be introduced to reduce the charge collection resistance if large-area cells are to be fabricated.8,36
 Fig. 5  (a) An image and (b) the J–V characteristics under illumination and in the dark of an 8 cm2 OSC (Glass/ITO/ZnO/PBDB-T:ITIC/MoO3/Ag). (c) An image and (d) J–V characteristics under illumination and in the dark of a 52 cm2 OSC (Glass/ITO/Ag grid/ZnO/PBDB-T:ITIC/MoO3/Ag). The images were obtained from the ITO side. The Ag lines and the randomly occurred defects were patched up using PMMA. 
Next, we further enlarged the device area to 52 (8 × 6.5) cm2. Silver lines with a width of 1 mm, spaced 10 mm apart, and thickness (height) of 150 nm were deposited on ITO to reduce the carrier collection path length while maintaining the transparency. However, these lines on top of ITO will induce short-circuiting defects causing the direct contact of the Ag lines and the top electrode when the height of Ag exceeds the optimized thickness of PBDB-T:ITIC (80–100 nm). Herein, we applied the patching strategy to overcome the short-circuiting issue. After depositing the active layer, we also selectively coated the insulating polymer PMMA on top of the active layer via Maobi-coating along the Ag lines area to fully isolate the lines to avoid the electrical short circuit. The areas covered with the opaque silver grid would not contribute to the JSC; thus, patching these areas won't significantly affect the performance. The image of the finished device is shown in Fig. 5c. Fig. 5d shows the J–V curves under illumination and in the dark obtained for 52 cm2 PBDB-T:ITIC OSC based on the ITO/Ag grid. The cell yields VOC = 0.86 V, JSC = 8.0 mA cm−2, FF = 0.32, and PCE = 2.2%. This performance was not high because of the low JSC and FF; however, considering the cell size, it was still remarkable that monolithic cells with this large area could be demonstrated through spin-coating, and the thickness of active layer was only 100 nm.
Besides monolithic single solar cells, we also fabricated solar modules. Unlike a monolithic cell, modules are less affected by the ITO resistance. We fabricated 21 cm2 OSC modules (comprising five subcells; each subcell with an area of 4.2 × 1 cm2). The defects occurred randomly in the active layer and were patched up via Maobi-coating of PMMA. Fig. S7a† shows the images of a fabricated device. This module yields VOC = 4.18 V, JSC = 2.4 mA cm−2, FF = 0.52, and PCE = 5.1% (Fig. S7b†). Each sub-cell displays a VOC of 0.84 V, which is close to that of the PBDB-T:ITIC-based reference cells. This means we can also fabricate efficient solar modules with the assistance of the proposed patching strategy.
3. Conclusions
In this study, we have reported a physical strategy to patch up defects in the photoactive layer to improve the device yield of organic solar cells for large-area production. Herein, two factors are important to make the strategy effective: one is the patching tool of Maobi that has the advantage of patterning to realize selective coating and ink holding and the other is the appropriate selection of the patching materials. We have concluded the following criteria of selecting the patching materials: electric insulativity, solution processability, solvent orthogonality to the active layer, good wetting on the active layer, and chemical inactivity with the active layer and interfacial layer. PMMA and PVA were found to be very effective as patching materials. PEI is effective for a donor:fullerene-type active layer, but not for a donor:ITIC-type active layer because of a chemical reaction between PEI and ITIC. By Maobi-coating a layer of insulating polymer (PVA or PMMA) on the defect area, the efficiency can be fully restored. Finally, we demonstrated 52 cm2 monolithic organic solar cells constructed with the assistance of the patching strategy. The strategy proposed herein is generic and can be applied to other materials as well as other types of devices (for example, organic light-emitting diodes).
4. Experimental
4.1. Materials
Maobi is made from weasel hair and a “White Bamboo” stalk (A-61, Shuangxi Hubi) produced in Huzhou, China. P3HT (Mw = 60–80 kDa). ICBA was received from Luminescence Technology Corp. PBDB-T (Mw = 11.5 kDa), and the non-fullerene acceptor ITIC was purchased from Solarmer Energy Inc. PEI (Mw = 25000 kDa), PVA (Mw = 80–90 kDa), and PMMA (Mw = 350 kDa) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. A silver slug (99.999%) and molybdenum oxide (99.9%) used for evaporation were received from Alfa Aesar. All the materials were used without further purification.
PEI was dissolved in isopropanol at a concentration of 0.1 mg mL−1 for ITO modification and 100 mg mL−1 for patching. PVA was dissolved in deionized water at 80 °C at a concentration of 50 mg mL−1, followed by the addition of 40 mg mL−1 PEG-TmDD to enhance the wettability. PMMA was dissolved in acetone (0.5 g in 1 mL) and stirred for 3 h. The P3HT and ICBA blend film was prepared from a chlorobenzene solution of P3HT:ICBA (1:1, wt%) with a total concentration of 40 mg mL−1. For the active layer of PBDB-T:ITIC, 10 mg of PBDB-T and 10 mg of ITIC were dissolved in 1 mL of chlorobenzene/1,8-diiodoctane (99.5:0.5, by volume). The ZnO precursor solution was synthesized according to a literature procedure.37
4.2. Fabrication and patch up of OSCs
Solar cells based on PBDB-T:ITIC were fabricated with the structure Glass/ITO/ZnO/PBDB-T:ITIC/MoO3/Ag. ZnO was spin-coated on a pre-cleaned ITO glass at 2500 rpm and heated at 150 °C for 20 min in air. The photoactive layer of PBDB-T:ITIC was prepared by spin coating at 2500 rpm and annealed at 160 °C for 10 min in a N2-filled glove box. The top electrode of 7 nm MoO3 and 60 nm Ag was prepared using a thermal evaporator (Mini-Spectros, Kurt J. Lesker). The active area was defined by the overlap of ITO and top Ag. Solar cells based on P3HT:ICBA were fabricated with the structure ITO/PEI/P3HT:ICBA/MoO3/Ag. Pre-cleaned ITO glass was first spin-coated with PEI at 5000 rpm, then deposited with the photoactive layer at 800 rpm, and heated at 150 °C for 10 min in a glovebox. The top electrode of 7 nm MoO3 and 60 nm Ag was deposited through thermal evaporation. The active area was defined by the overlap of ITO and top Ag.
For the defect patching process, defects in the photoactive layer with a certain size were created by scratching off the active layer film using a scalpel prior to MoO3/Ag deposition. To patch up the defects, PEI or PVA or PMMA was coated via the Maobi tool to cover the defect spot. To minimize the area loss, precise patterning of the Maobi coating is needed.
The fabrication of large-area cells resembles the previous fabrication of small-area cells except for a larger area and an additional evaporation of a silver grid to facilitate current collection with a line width of 800 ± 50 μm spaced 10 mm apart and a thickness of 150 nm. The shadow loss was calculated to be about 10%. The spin-coating process of the active layer for the large-area cell involves a knife-coating procedure. Initially, the solution was cast onto one edge of the square substrate; then, a glass slide was used to spread the solution all over the substrate in a few seconds. When the substrate was fully covered with the solution, the spin-coating step was started. Using this modified coating method, a large amount of active materials could be saved, especially for large-area film deposition.
4.3. Characterization
The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics were measured inside a N2-filled glove box using a source meter (2400, Keithley Instruments) controlled by a LabVIEW program under AM1.5G (100 mW cm−2) and a Newport solar simulator. The optical microscopic images were obtained using an optical microscope (DM4000 M, Leica). The thickness values of the samples were determined using a DEKTAK XT profilometer.
