    , Accepted 18th March 2015First published on 18th March 2015AbstractA Na3V2(PO4)3/C (NVP/C) composite is successfully synthesized by the sol–gel method and examined as the anode material for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) by means of galvanostatic charge–discharge profiles, cyclic voltammograms, rate performance and cyclic voltammetry comprehensively. The NVP/C electrode delivers a reversible capacity of about 170 mA h g−1 between 3.0 and 0.01 V at a current density of 20 mA g−1 corresponding to three sodium ions insertion/extraction processes. Besides the voltage plateau at 1.57 V, another novel working platform at around 0.28 V is found for the first time in both charging and discharging profiles, possibly owing to the further reduction of vanadium. NVP/C exhibits an excellent rate capability and long-cycle stability with a capacity retention of 62% after 3000 cycles at a high charge rate of 10 C (2 A g−1). Moreover, the intercalation-type Na-ions storage mechanism is proposed on the basis of ex situ X-ray diffraction and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. Our findings reveal that the NVP/C sample is a promising anode material for SIBs due to its superior rate capability and long cycle life.
Introduction
With increasing concern on the non-renewable fossil fuel consumption, clean-energy development and storage have become a hot topic for worldwide governments, scientists and engineers. Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), as the most widespread energy storage system (ESS), have greatly revolutionized people's daily lives from portable electronic devices to hybrid or fully electric vehicles (EVs) owing to their high energy and power density over the past decades.1,2 However, the limited lithium resource and the growing cost strongly restrict their application as the large-scale ESS for wind and solar power.
Currently, sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have received renewed attention as the low-cost and large-scale ESS thanks to the abundant resources of sodium in earth and the similarity in the chemistry between lithium and sodium. Especially, the “rocking-chair” mechanism is also suitable for the SIB system,3–5 which triggers the intensive studies on electrode materials analogous to those of LIBs. Compared with the widely studied layered and polyanion-type cathode materials,6–11 searching for the suitable anode materials for SIBs is particularly urgent since the graphite electrode cannot accommodate Na+ ions at low potential in a Na salt electrolyte. Progresses in developing anode materials also follow the strategies of LIBs on the basis of three mechanisms: insertion/extraction mechanism,12 conversion reaction13 and alloying/de-alloying process.14,15 For example, nanocomposites between antimony/phosphorus and carbon can deliver a high discharge capacity, which, pitifully, cannot avoid the volume expansion during the alloying/de-alloying process.15 The intercalation mechanism has also been examined in several titanium-based compounds used as the promising anodes for SIBs. Na2Ti3O7 delivers an initial discharge capacity of more than 200 mA h g−1, but the cycling performance is not satisfactory.16,17 NaTiO2 can stabilize at around 150 mA h g−1 between 1.6 and 0.6 V corresponding to 0.6 Na ion intercalation.18 Particularly, a novel P-2 type Na2/3Co1/3Ti2/3O2 is prepared as an intercalation-type anode with 85% capacity retention for 3000 cycles and 41% capacity retention at a charge–discharge rate of 10 C.19 Note that although the reversible capacity of Na2/3Co1/3Ti2/3O2 is relatively low (ca. 90 and 40 mA h g−1 at the current density of 0.02 and 1 A g−1, respectively), the excellent cycle stability and rate capability are considered as two essential characteristics for the application of the large-scale ESS.
The polyanion-type compound, Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP), has been widely studied as a cathode material for SIBs owing to its typical NASICON (Na super-ionic conductor) structure.20–24 As shown in the inset of Fig. 1, NVP is composed of isolated [VO6] octahedra and [PO4] tetrahedra by sharing a corner. Two independent Na ions partially occupy the channels with six-fold or eight-fold oxygen coordination. This unique open framework supports the diffusion of Na ions. A NVP-based cathode is electrochemically active at two different voltages of 3.4 V and 1.63 V, related to the redox couples V4+/V3+ and V3+/V2+, respectively.21 At the higher voltage, the carbon-coated NVP shows an outstanding rate performance with a discharge capacity of 44 mA h g−1 at a high current density of 22 A g−1 (200 C).25 At the lower potential between 2.0 and 1.3 V the additional reversible capacity is nearly 60 mA h g−1, suggesting that only one V3+ ion contributes to the charge compensation with a mixed valence state of vanadium in Na4V2(PO4)3.21 The multiple oxidation states of vanadium ranging from +5 down to +1 and the open framework of NVP allow the accommodation of even more Na ions at low potentials.

A comprehensive study of the electrochemical properties of the NVP/C composite as an anode for SIBs in the voltage window of 3.0–0.01 V is reported. Besides the voltage plateau at 1.57 V an additional, previously not-considered plateau at around 0.28 V is observed during both charging and discharging. Furthermore, the as-prepared NVP/C sample demonstrates a reversible discharge capacity of 170 mA h g−1 at 0.1 C (1 C corresponds to 200 mA g−1). It exhibits an outstanding long-cycle life and rate capability whose capacity retention reaches 62% after 3000 cycles at 10 C. Moreover, an intercalation mechanism is proposed for an NVP/C electrode on the basis of ex situ XRD and HRTEM.
Experimental
Preparation and characterization
NVP/C samples were prepared by the sol–gel method. Firstly, the stoichiometric amount of Na2CO3, NH4VO3 and NH4H2PO4 with a molar ratio of 3:4:6 was dissolved in deionized water. Secondly, 0.02 M aqueous citric acid [HOC(COOH) (CH2COOH)2] solution was added dropwise into the solution until the ratio of vanadium:citric acid equals to 2:1. Then ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH, 28.0–30.0% NH3 basis) was used to adjust the pH value of solution to 9, and the gel could be acquired by drying the precursor in an oven at 120 °C for 12 hours. Finally the NVP/C powder can be acquired after heat treatments in two steps, one: at 350 °C for 5 hours and then at 800 °C for 12 hours under a nitrogen atmosphere with intermediate grinding.
The structural analysis of the NVP/C material was based on X-ray diffraction (XRD), using a STOE STADI/P powder diffractometer (Mo Kα1 radiation, curved Ge (111) monochromator, transmission mode, and linear PSD counter). A Hitachi SU8020 type scanning electron microscope (SEM) was used to investigate the morphological property, and a FEI Tecnai G2 type transmission electron microscope (TEM) for the microstructure. Raman spectroscopy was performed on a Renishaw inVia Raman microscope with Ar-ion laser excitation (λ = 514.5 nm). The content of carbon in the NVP/C sample was evaluated using a Mettler-Toledo thermal gravimetric analyzer.
Electrochemical measurement
The electrochemical properties of the as-prepared NVP/C were examined by assembling coin-type half cells with sodium foil as the counter electrode. The electrodes were prepared by coating a slurry, in which the NVP/C active materials, Super P conductive and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) binders dissolved in N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP) were mixed in a weight ratio of 7:2:1, on a copper foil current conductor. These electrode films were dried in a vacuum oven at 120 °C for 10 hours. After dividing the electrode film into square parts of 0.8 × 0.8 cm2, coin cells were assembled in a glove box. The separators of the cells were a glass fiber filter (Whatman GF/C). The electrolyte was 1 M NaClO4 dissolved in a solvent of ethylene carbonate (EC) and propylene carbonate (PC) (1:1 v/v). Galvanostatic charge–discharge cycling was then performed on a Land-2001A (Wuhan, China) automatic battery tester. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed on a VSP multichannel potentiostatic-galvanostatic system (Bio-Logic SAS, France).
Results and discussion

Fig. 1 displays the powder XRD pattern of the as-prepared NVP/C sample and the Rietveld refinement shows the pure phase formation with no detected impurities. It is obvious that all the diffraction peaks can be indexed on the basis of the NASICON structure with space group R3c. The calculated lattice constants a = 8.724 Å and c = 21.800 Å are consistent with previous reports.26 No features of crystalline carbon are observed in the XRD pattern, but the presence of carbon was confirmed by the measured Raman spectrum (Fig. 2a) and quantified from the TG curve (Fig. 2b): the high intensity of the D-band at 1364 cm−1 in comparison with the G-band at 1593 cm−1 confirms the high disorder of non-graphitic carbon. The amount of carbon was estimated to be 3.24 wt% from the weight loss in an oxygen atmosphere. Note that the weight gain step after 430 °C is related to the oxidation of V3+ ions in oxygen.21,27–29

The morphology of the NVP/C composite was studied by SEM (Fig. 3a) and TEM (Fig. 3b–d) images. It can be seen that the as-prepared NVP/C sample shows various particle sizes ranging from 50 to 200 nm. The EDX spectrum (the inset of Fig. 3a) reveals that only the peaks of Na, V, P, O and C are identified without any other impurity peaks. A three-dimensional carbon network is formed, which provides a good electronic contact between different particles and the current collector with a resulting enhanced electronic conductivity. The high-magnification TEM image confirms that NVP particles are distributed inside the carbon framework. Hence, a superior rate capability can be expected for the NVP/C composite. To facilitate the observation of lattice fringes clearly, the Fourier filtered image is acquired by using in-plane Fourier spots, as depicted in the inset of Fig. 3c. The crystalline region with clear lattice fringes has an interplanar spacing of about 0.28 nm, consistent with the (116) atomic plane of the rhombohedral structure in the hexagonal setting. The corresponding SAED also confirms the single phase nature of the NVP/C sample.

For the investigation of the electrochemical activity of a NVP/C-based anode in an SIB, a [NVP/C ‖ 1 M NaClO4 in (EC/PC) ‖ Na] half cell was assembled. Galvanostatic charge–discharge cycling for NVP/C is carried out over the voltage range of 3.0–0.01 V at the charge rate of 0.1 C, as shown in Fig. 4a. Firstly, it is obvious that the initial discharge curve differs from the subsequent ones and delivers a discharge capacity of 305 mA h g−1. Since the 2nd cycle, charge and discharge profiles are analogous to each other, indicating only a weak polarization in these NVP/C cells. A reversible capacity of 170 mA h g−1 can be acquired, suggesting that nearly 3 Na ions per formula unit contribute to the electrochemical cycles. The extra capacity of the initial discharge process over the subsequent cycles could be related to the formation of a solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layer and the decomposition of the electrolyte, which is expected at such low anode potentials below the stability limit of the electrolyte, very similar as for a LIB.30,31 To improve the low coulombic efficiency, further experiments by using additives in the electrolytes,32–34 or modifying the surface of the NVP particles, are ongoing.25 Consistent with the previous reports,35 one plateau at around 1.57 V is observed, which is related to the reversible phase transition from Na3V2(PO4)3 to Na4V2(PO4)3. Accordingly, the valence state of vanadium will change from +3 to +2.5. With further decreasing potential, an additional voltage plateau located at around 0.28 V is observed for the first time during both discharge and charge, caused by the formation of Na6V2(PO4)3 with an average vanadium oxidation state of +1.5. Note that it has been reported that Li3V2(PO4)3 with a NASICON-type structure can also accommodate 4 Li+ ions between 3.0 and 0.01 V with the formation of Li7V2(PO4)3.36,37 The great storage ability of Li+ and Na+ ions in the NASICON structure can be ascribed to its open framework and the transition metal of vanadium which can provide a wide range of charge compensation during the Li+/Na+ intercalation process. Also, the cycle performance and coulombic efficiency of the NVP/C anode are shown in Fig. 4b. Since the 3rd cycle, both specific capacity and coulombic efficiency tend to be stabilized at ca. 170 mA h g−1 and 99%, respectively, in the subsequent cycles.

Fig. 5 demonstrates the CV profiles of a NVP/C-based electrode recorded at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s−1vs. Na+/Na between 3 and 0.01 V. At the first glance, an irreversible peak located at 0.45 V appears in the initial cathodic scan and disappears in the subsequent cycles, which is related to the decomposition of the electrolyte to form the solid electrolyte interface (SEI) film. Apart from this irreversible peak, two pairs of redox peaks can be observed. The first pair is located between 2.0 and 1.3 V and corresponds to the reversible reduction of V3+ to V2+, while the second pair with a reduction peak at 0.14 V and an oxidation peak at 0.43 V implies a further reduction process of vanadium from V2+ to V1+, also consistent with the voltage plateau in the charging–discharging profiles of the NVP/C electrode. Furthermore, another pair of redox peaks at the low working potential (nearly 0 V) forms since the 2nd cycle, which can be attributed to the insertion/extraction of sodium ions in the interlayer of graphitic microcrystallites. Similar behavior has also been observed in the carbon-based anode materials for the SIB application.38–41 Notably, all the CV profiles since the 2nd cycle are nearly superimposed on each other, suggesting the excellent electrochemical reversibility.

Furthermore, the charge–discharge profiles of NVP/C at various current densities are recorded and shown in Fig. 6a. With increasing current density, the polarization between the charging and discharging curve increases. Additionally, the rate capability is evaluated at different current densities for every successive ten cycles, as presented in Fig. 6b.The NVP/C-based electrodes deliver reversible capacities of 166, 146, 132, 114, 85 and 62 mA h g−1 at the current densities of 0.2 C, 0.5 C, 1 C, 2 C, 5 C and 10 C, respectively. When the current density returns to 0.2 C after 60 cycles, the capacity can even reach 176 mA h g−1, either as high as the initial capacity within experimental uncertainty or even higher owing to the gradual activation of some cell components. In comparison with the recently reported titanium-based anode materials for SIBs,42–45 the rate performance of NVP/C is competitive for the following two reasons: the open framework of the NASICON structure permits a fast transport of Na ions and results in a high ionic conductivity. The uniform distribution of the active NVP particles in the amorphous carbon network can effectively shorten the electronic pathways, increase the electronic conductivity and increase the electrochemically active surface area between the active material and the electrolyte. Triggered by the excellent rate capability of the NVP/C composites, a long-term cycling at high current densities was also recorded and is shown in Fig. 6c. Capacity retentions of 71% and 62% can be achieved after 1000 and 3000 cycles at the constant current densities of 5 C (1 A g−1) and 10 C (2 A g−1), respectively. These appealing features of NVP/C-based anodes, such as superior rate capability and long-term cyclability, will qualify their utilization in the large-scale ESS for wind and solar power.

As a novel anode material with the NASICON structure for SIBs, it is necessary to study its Na+ storage and release mechanisms. Ex situ XRD patterns at different discharge and charge depths of the initial cycle are recorded, as presented in Fig. 7. By comparing the XRD patterns before and after the first discharge working plateau at around 1.57 V, it can be observed that the double peaks at 20.06° (104) and 20.26° (110) merge into one peak, while the peak intensity of 14.3° (012) and 35.6° (300) fades gradually and a new one at 34.8° forms. All these features strongly suggest the co-existence of two phases after nearly one mole Na+ ion insertion. Further insertion of Na+ ions at low working potential around 0.28 V induces the disappearance of peaks located at 2θ = 14.3° (012) and 35.6° (300), and appearance of new additional ones located at 2θ = 31.6° and 34.8°, which also indicates the possible formation of a new phase. Similar phase evolution has been found in the NASICON-type Li3V2(PO4)3 (ref. 36, 46 and 47) and Na3Ti2(PO4)3 electrodes.48 Furthermore, Fig. 7c and d show the ex situ XRD patterns at different charge depths with a similar phase transition near the working plateaus at around 0.28 V and 1.57 V. Note that it is hard to determine the structural models only based on the ex situ XRD patterns. In situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction of the NVP/C composite is ongoing, contributing to further understanding of the Na+ ion migration pathway.

Ex situ XRD patterns of the NVP/C composite recorded at different discharge (a and b) and charge depths (c and d). 
In addition, ex situ XRD patterns after 3000 cycles are recorded in comparison with the pristine one as shown in Fig. 8. Though some diffraction peaks disappear and some appear, the existence of these diffraction peaks, the characteristics of the NASICON structure, confirms the excellent cyclability even at the high rate of 10 C. Ex situ SEM and TEM images are also examined to follow any micro-structural evolutions. As manifested in the Scanning Electron Micrographs, there is no obvious so-called pulverization problem, which usually occurs for the anode materials with conversion or alloying/de-alloying mechanisms.49,50 After 3000 cycles, the average particle size of NVP is still between 200 and 500 nm. Note that some small particles with diameters of around 10–20 nm belong to the Super P conductive additive and can be observed on the surface of NVP particles from both SEM and TEM images. Furthermore, NVP particles are uniformly distributed inside the carbon network at different cycling stages as manifested in the TEM pictures, which well explains the superior rate capability and long-cycle lives of NVP/C-based electrodes. Additionally, no observed change in the lattice fringe using the Fourier filtered images is found for the NVP/C composite during cycling (Fig. 9).

Conclusions
NVP/C composites are prepared by the sol–gel method and their electrochemical performance as anodes in the Na half cells is reported for the first time. NVP/C can deliver a reversible capacity of 170 mA h g−1 between 3.0 and 0.01 V with excellent capacity retention. NVP/C electrodes also show a remarkable rate capability (reversible capacity reaches more than 60 mA h g−1 at the current density of 2 A g−1) and long-term cyclability (capacity retention equals to 62% after 3000 cycles at the current density of 2 A g−1). On the basis of ex situ XRD and HRTEM images, the intercalation-type sodium ion storage mechanism is proposed. The NVP/C composite is expected to be a promising anode material for SIBs.
