    , Accepted 6th August 2013First published on 14th August 2013AbstractDry plasma reduction (DPR) is an excellent approach for easily, continuously, uniformly and stably hybridizing platinum nanoparticles (Pt-NPs) on a graphene-coated layer under atmospheric pressure without any toxic chemicals and at a low temperature. The Pt-NPs with a size of 0.5–4 nm and mostly 2 nm were stably and uniformly hybridized on the surface of reduced graphene oxide (RGO) after co-reduction of Pt precursor ions and GO to Pt atoms and RGO, respectively. XPS analysis also revealed a repair of structural damage on the basal plane of the graphene as well as chemical bonding between Pt-NPs and RGO after DPR. Thus, the Pt-NPs/RGO nanohybrids applied to the counter electrode of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) exhibited robust stability as well as ultrahigh electrochemical catalytic activity and conductivity using less than 1% of the Pt exploited for the Pt-sputtered counter electrodes. Thus, the Pt-NPs/RGO nanohybrid fabricated by DPR could be an excellent material for a robust and low-cost counter electrode for DSCs.
1. Introduction
A dye-sensitized solar cell (DSC) has drawn a lot of attentions due to its high conversion efficiency and low fabrication cost.1 The DSC's main components are the photo-anode, electrolyte and counter electrode (CE). Although the photo-anode has the greatest potential to improve the efficiency of the DSC, the CE also has an important role in reducing triiodide to iodide. Platinum (Pt), owing to its catalytic functionality, high conductivity and chemical stability in an acid–base environment, has been known as one of the best materials used as a CE for DSCs.1,2 The materials used as the CE for DSCs are required to have high conductivity and excellent catalytic activity. However, both requirements are not easy to simultaneously satisfy. For instance, a Pt layer directly sputtered on a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass substrate usually shows excellent conductivity, but also high charge transfer resistance due to the limited active surface area of the polycrystalline surface with internal defects,3 not to mention its high production cost using expensive vacuum processing and a Pt target. In other words, Pt nanoparticles (Pt-NPs) can provide high electro-catalytic activity owing to their large active area, but low electric conductivity because of their abundant grain boundaries and defects.4
Graphene is an emerging candidate material that can replace Pt owing to its 2D structure, high specific area, high electron mobility,5–8 and high electrochemical stability under prolonged potential cycling.6,7 However, graphene CEs usually require a large amount of graphene to achieve an acceptable level of catalytic activity.5,7 Thus, Pt-NPs supported on graphene, using only a small amount of Pt, can be a most reasonable alternative that can satisfy the inevitable requirements of low cost and long-term stability as well as excellent catalytic functionality and high electric conductivity. Many attempts have been made to combine graphene and Pt metals9–16 with a chemical or physical reducing agent. Pt-NPs/graphene CEs have been mostly fabricated by depositing Pt precursor ions on the graphene film/substrate and then the Pt precursor ions were reduced to Pt metal by chemical reducing agents such as hydrazine hydrate10 and sodium borohydride (NaBH4)11 or physical methods such as photo-reduction,10 thermal decomposition,12 hydrogen plasma17 or a combined chemical and physical reducing agent such as a microwave-assisted heating method in an ethylene glycol media.9 Recently, Pt-NPs were directly deposited on the graphene using the pulsed laser ablation method.18 The previous methods have some drawbacks such as a high reduction rate during chemical reduction,10,11 long reduction time during photo-reduction,10 long cooling time and agglomeration of NPs owing to high temperature reduction,12 expensive vacuum equipment and Pt targets,17,18 rendering it difficult to develop an economic, continuous process. Recently, we developed a new process of efficiently synthesizing supported Pt-NPs using dry plasma reduction (DPR) at near room temperature under atmospheric pressure.19 This method allows us to overcome the process restrictions previously mentioned-especially in a high temperature, low pressure, or toxic liquid environment. Furthermore, hydrogen radicals and electrons formed during the plasma reduction process20 can also reduce oxygen-containing functional groups on the surface of GO.21
Herein, we present a strategy to easily, continuously, uniformly and stably hybridize Pt-NPs on the surface of reduced graphene oxide (RGO) with simultaneous co-reduction of Pt precursor ions and GO to Pt atoms and RGO, respectively, through DPR. It is expected that the Pt-NPs/RGO nanohybrids will show ultrahigh catalytic activity, conductivity and good long-term stability for regenerating iodide from triiodide at the CE of DSCs due to chemical bonding of Pt-NPs with graphene under atmospheric pressure plasma and physical bonding between the graphene sheet and FTO glass with the aid of a binder, which is composed of paste and removed after annealing.
2. Experimental
2.1. Materials
Graphite flakes were purchased from Sigma. Sulfuric acid (H2SO4), sodium nitrate (NaNO3), potassium permanganate (KMnO4), hydrochloric acid (HCl) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. A Pt precursor solution containing 10 mM H2PtCl6·xH2O (≥37.5% Pt basic, Sigma-Aldrich) in iso-propyl alcohol (IPA) (99.5%, Sigma-Aldrich) was first prepared. FTO glass as a conductive transparency electrode was purchased from Pilkington, USA (∼8 Ω □−1). These substrates were used after cleaning by sonic treatment in acetone (Fluka). Nonporous TiO2 paste and ruthenium based-dye (N719) were purchased from Solaronix, Switzerland. The dye was adsorbed from a 0.3 mM solution in a mixed solvent of acetonitrile (Sigma-Aldrich) and tert-butylalcohol (Aldrich) with a volume ratio of 1:1. The electrolyte was a solution of 0.60 M 1-methyl-3-butylimidazolium iodide (Sigma-Aldrich), 0.03 M I2 (Sigma-Aldrich), 0.10 M guanidinium thiocyanate (Sigma-Aldrich), and 0.50 M 4-tert-butylpyridine (Aldrich) in a mixed solvent of acetonitrile (Sigma-Aldrich), and valeronitrile, with a volume ratio of 85:15.
2.2. Synthesis and characterization of Pt-NPs hybridized on graphene oxide sheets
GO was synthesized from graphite flakes using the modified Hummers method22 and ESI Fig. S1.† 10 mg of GO powder was mixed with a 1 wt% solution of ethyl cellulose (Sigma-Aldrich) in terpineol (Sigma-Aldrich) by a three-roll miller. To prepare the GO CEs, the GO paste was coated on the FTO-glass substrate by a doctor blade and dried at 300 °C for 30 min.20 Then 3 μl of Pt precursor was dropped on the GO CE and the solvent was allowed to evaporate at 70 °C for 10 min. Then, the specimens were reduced using Ar plasma under atmospheric pressure at the power of 150 W and a gas flow rate of 5 l min−1, for a reduction time of 15 min, and substrate moving speed of 5 mm s−1 as shown in Fig. 1a.19
 Fig. 1  (a) The atmospheric pressure plasma system; (b) synthesis of Pt-NPs hybridized on RGO using dry plasma reduction. 
The morphology of the Pt-NPs/RGO hybrid was characterized using field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) (Jeol JSM 7000F). The structure of the Pt-NPs/RGO hybrid was analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectroscopy (Regaku D/MAX-RC) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (JEM-2100F, Joel, Japan). The chemical state of the hybrids was analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) using a spectrometer (Sigma Probe Thermo Fisher VG Scientific) equipped with a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray source, and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) (JEM-2100F, Joel, Japan). For TEM analysis of a highly magnified Pt-NPs/RGO nanohybrid, we scratched part of the coated layer, dispersed in an ethanol suspension, and transferred it to a holey carbon grid.19
2.3. Preparation and electrochemical characterization of counter electrodes
We prepared three different CEs for comparison. The first one was a GO-coated CE. The details of the electrode fabrication are described elsewhere.20 The second one was a Pt-sputtered CE. It was deposited by DC-sputtering Pt at 10 mA and under a pressure of 2 × 10−3 torr for 5 min.23 The third one was a Pt-NPs/RGO-coated CE. It was prepared as explained in the previous section. The redox behaviors of these electrodes were evaluated through comparative analysis of their CVs. Three-electrode electrochemical cells were used. The Pt mesh and Hg/Hg2+ electrode served as a CE and reference electrode, respectively. The electrolyte consisted of 10 mmol l−1 LiI, 1 mmol l−1 I2 and 1 mmol l−1 LiClO4. The CVs were recorded in a range of 600 to −300 mV with a scan rate of 50 mV s−1.23
2.4. Assembly and measurements of DSCs
The assembly and measurements of the DSCs were carried out as described in our previous study.23 Photocurrent–voltage characteristics were performed with an IVIUMSTAT under illumination from a Sun 3000 solar simulator composed of 1000 W mercury-based Xe arc lamps and AM 1.5-G filters. The impedance spectroscopy of DSC was measured under constant light illumination (100 mW cm−2) biased at open-circuit condition, 100 kHz to 100 mHz of frequency range with perturbation amplitude of 10 mV.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Synthesis and characterization of Pt-NP/RGO nanohybrid materials
The synthesis of Pt-NPs hybridized on a GO-coated FTO glass substrate, which was started from the preparation of graphite flakes (shown in ESI Fig. S1†) using a modified Hummers method,22 was achieved by using a DPR, as sketched in Fig. 1b. As the first step, a drop of precursor solution was loaded on the GO-coated FTO glass, followed by a complete drying process of solvent at 70 °C for 10 min. During this drying process, H2PtCl6·xH2O was partially reduced to Pt atoms through alcoholic reduction. In the second step, the remaining salts on the dried surface are further reduced to Pt-NPs through the irradiation of RF atmospheric pressure plasma with Ar gas under previously optimized conditions.19 At this step, RGO was also formed from GO through the reaction with electrons and hydrogen radicals,20 which are generated through the atomization reaction of the Pt precursor at the interface between the plasmas and Pt salt on the surface of the GO-coated electrode, with the oxygen containing functional groups on the surface of the GO-coated electrode.21 As shown in Fig. 1, the DPR can also be well adapted to develop an economic continuous process for immobilizing metal NPs on the surface of various substrates including thermoplastic films as well as GO-coated FTO glass substrates.
Scanning electron microscope (SEM) and transmission electron microscope (TEM) images of GO CE and Pt-NPs/RGO nanohybrid structures are shown in Fig. 2a–c. The Pt-NPs are clearly visible and successfully immobilized on RGO (Fig. 2b). The reduction of GO to RGO will be confirmed by the XPS data below (Fig. 3). As can be seen in Fig. 2b, Pt NPs are favorably well dispersed on the surface of RGO without showing any agglomeration. The TEM image (Fig. 2c) further confirms the SEM analysis, showing that the Pt-NPs have a size in the range of 0.5–4 nm and mostly 2 nm, which are quite small and highly mono-dispersed. The average size of Pt-NPs formed on the surface of the Cu grid and FTO glass was 2.5 and 3 nm, respectively.19 The average size of the Pt-NPs on RGO is slightly larger than that of Pt-NPs on CVD-grown graphene (1.5 nm).24 The dependence of the NP size on the nature of the substrates could be due to the different electrostatic energy of the graphene.25 Other studies using chemical or physical methods reported that Pt-NPs grown on the surface of graphene had a size larger than 10 nm due to the high reduction rate of NaBH4,13 larger than 5 nm due to vitamin C reduction,14 and larger than 3 nm due to ethylene glycol under an ultrafast microwave-assisted method.9,15,16 In this study, Pt-NPs are not only uniform, but also well distributed on the surface of the RGO without any aggregation. A heavy element, Pt, is distinctly observed in Fig. 2c, where the lattice spacing is shown in the enlarged image, and the estimated lattice spacing is 1.96 Å, which coincides well with Pt {200}.20

The fitting was done after Shirley + Liner background subtraction on the fitting interval. The spectra are fit by Lorentzian–Gaussian functions. 
Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), measured during the TEM observation, identified the Pt-NPs immobilized on the surface of the RGO. The peaks of Pt were observed at 2.1 and 9.6 keV, as shown in Fig. 2d.20 The other peaks of C, O, and Cu must be originated from the RGO, oxygen functional groups, and background grid, respectively. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of the Pt-NPs/RGO nanohybrid samples on the Si wafer substrate is shown in Fig. 2e. The single broad diffraction peak at 2θ = 33° belongs to the Si wafer substrate. The XRD pattern of the Pt-NPs/RGO nanohybrid sample exhibits the characteristic diffraction peaks of Pt (111) at 2θ = 39.7°, and Pt (200) at 2θ = 46.2°, indicating that Pt is present in the face-centered cubic phase.
The progressive loss of oxygen functional groups after using dry plasma reduction was studied by using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The fits used to extract the various C/C, C/O and Pt/O bonding configurations and their concentrations are indicated inside the spectra in Fig. 3 and the parameters are listed in Table 1. The fitting was done after a Shirley + Liner background subtraction on the fitting interval. The C 1s spectrum of GO film was prepared at 70 °C for decomposition of five different shifted components: C–H (283.93 eV); CC/C–C in aromatic rings (284.6 eV); C–O in the hydroxyl and epoxy groups (286.1 eV); CO in the carbonyl and ketone groups (287.5 eV); and C(O)–(OH) in the carbonyl group (289.2 eV).

These assignments are not in full agreement with previous works,26,27 because of the disappearance of the shake-up satellite (π–π*) peak at 290.6 eV. This phenomenon could be explained by the less oxidized GO.26 Indeed, the π–π* peak appeared after annealing of the GO film at 300 °C as can be seen in Fig. 3b and Table 1. However, Hontoria-Lucas et al.27 assigned the shake-up satellite peak to π-electrons delocalized in the aromatic network and the intensity of this peak decreased when the oxidation time increased. Our results agreed with Katzman et al.28 and Papirer et al.,29 who proved that the π–π* peak occludes CO. Thus, the π–π* peak was completely removed after plasma reduction (see Fig. 3c and Table 1). The formation and development of oxygen functional groups during the sintering process at 300 °C for 30 min occurred, resulting in an increase in the percentage of CO, C(O)OH and CO (π–π*) groups. However, following dry plasma reduction, the spectra of Pt-NPs/RGO demonstrated that the carboxyl and shake-up satellite groups were almost entirely removed, while some of the carbonyl and hydroxyl carbon groups were also decreased and transformed into C–H and C–O groups. In addition, a decrease in the number of hydroxyl groups could be at least partially caused by the chemical bonding of Pt-NPs such as C–Pt or C–O–Pt.11,30 The percentage of CC/C–C groups increased because of the increased extent of the aromatic domain. It suggests a repair of structural damage on the basal plane of the graphene.11
In order to identify the chemical bonding between the Pt-NPs and RGO we measured the XPS spectra of Pt 4f. The XPS Pt 4f core level spectrum of Pt-NPs/RGO is presented in Fig. 3d. The peaks at 70.87 eV and 71.2 eV may be assigned to the zero valence state of Pt metals. The peak at 74.6 eV may be attributed to the interaction between the Pt-NPs and RGO support.31 The peak at 74 eV binding energy may be related to PtO/PtO2. These results show that the metallic Pt was reduced on the RGO due to the percentage of zero-valence state of Pt (90.42%). The C(O)OH, CO and C–OH groups were also reduced after dry plasma reduction; this suggests the forming of C–Pt and C–O–Pt.30 Thus, the XPS measurements provided direct evidence of the GO existence, and the reduction in GO to RGO and Pt ions to Pt metal hybridized on RGO (Table 2).

Raman spectroscopy is a powerful tool to characterize carbonaceous materials, particularly for distinguishing ordered and disordered crystal structures of carbon.32,33 The Raman spectrum of the pristine natural graphite is well known. The spectrum displays a strong G line at 1582 cm−1, a weak D line at 1350 cm−1, a broad 2D line at 2690 cm−1, and a very weak 2G line at 3245 cm−1.32,33 The D band peak is attributed to the disordered structures, such as bond-angle disorders and asymmetric lattices in the graphite. The G band peak represents one of the fundamental Raman modes of sp2-bonded graphite. Fig. 4 shows the Raman spectra of the GO and Pt-NPs/RGO nanohybrid. The spectra are very similar. The discernible peaks can be indexed as a D-band (blue line) at 1340 cm−1, a G-band (purple line) at 1595 cm−1, and a D′-band (green line) at 1620 cm−1. Compared to pristine graphite, the D band of the GO and Pt-NPs/RGO nanohybrid are shifted upward to 1595 cm−1. Furthermore, the intensity of the D band is higher than that of the G band. These phenomena could be attributed to the significant decrease in the size of the in-plane sp2 domains due to oxidation and ultrasonic exfoliation, and the partially ordered graphite crystal structure of the graphene nanosheets.32,34 At the same time, a strong D′ peak occurred, which can be assigned to the nonzero phonon density of the states above the G band. These phonons, which are usually Raman-inactive, can become active due to phonon confinement caused by the defects.33 We noted that the ID/IG intensity ratio of GO (2.35) is higher than that of the Pt-NPs/RGO nanohybrid (1.79). The lowering of the D to G peak ratios point out the increase in the average size of the sp2 domains upon reduction of the GO due to the loss of oxygen.26 This result has been supported by XPS analyses as aforementioned.

3.2. Photocurrent–voltage characteristics of Pt-NPs/RGO nanohybrid materials as the CE of DSC

Fig. 5 shows the photocurrent–voltage (J–V) characteristics of DSCs fabricated with Pt-NPs/RGO-coated, GO-coated and Pt-sputtered CEs. The device photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 3. The DSC with the Pt-NPs/RGO nanohybrid-coated CE shows an energy conversion efficiency of 8.56(±0.10)% (with a 0.93 μg of Pt), which is better than those of the DSCs with the GO-coated CE and Pt-sputtered CE (122.5 μg Pt), viz. 4.48(±0.12)% and 8.18(±0.08)%, due to the predominant synergic effect of graphene and Pt-NPs and owing to more interfacial active sites.35,36

The effect of the CE type on DSC performance was mainly derived from different electrical conductivity and electrocatalytic activity in the reduction of triiodide to iodide.36–38 In the cyclic voltammograms (ESI, Fig. S2†), the peak positions of the I3−/I− redox energy level being positively shifted in the case of the Pt-NPs/RGO-coated electrode could be explained by the fact that the open circuit voltages (Voc) of the DSCs with the Pt-NPs/RGO nanohybrid-coated electrode and Pt-sputtered electrode are higher than that of the DSC with the GO-coated electrode.23 However, the Pt-NPs/RGO nanohybrid-coated electrode has a higher current density, suggesting a larger active surface,39 while the reduction reaction of triiodide ions on the GO-coated electrode is obviously lower. Therefore, the introduction of Pt-NPs on the surface of the GO-coated electrode, which was transferred to RGO under DPR, leads to an obvious improvement in the electrocatalytic activity.

Fig. 6 represents the Nyquist plots of the DSCs with the Pt-NPs/RGO nanohybrid-coated, GO-coated and Pt-sputtered CEs. As mentioned before, the introduction of the Pt-NPs on the GO-coated electrode leads to an obvious improvement in the electrocatalytic activity due to providing a larger active surface area.20,35 We found that the Rct of the Pt-NPs/RGO nanohybrid-coated electrode was as small as 0.62 Ω cm2, while those of the Pt-sputtered electrode and GO-coated electrode were 1.22 Ω cm2 and 12.19 Ω cm2, respectively. The value of the constant phase element24 (CPE1 = (CPE1-T)−1(jw)−(CPE1-P), in which j2 = −1, w = frequency, CPE1-T and CPE1-P are frequency-independent parameters of the CPE) of the CE also confirms that the active surface areas of the Pt-NPs/RGO nanohybrid-coated electrode are larger than that of the Pt-sputtered electrode and GO-coated electrode. Indeed the value of CPE1-T of 4.08 × 10−3 F cm−2 for the Pt-NPs/RGO nanohybrid-coated electrode is much greater than the 9.59 × 10−5 F cm−2 of the Pt-sputtered electrode and even greater than 2.16 × 10−3 F cm−2 of the GO-coated electrode (Table 4). A larger CPE1-T means an increase in the active surface area. The porosity value (CPE1-P) for the three types of CE are listed in Table 4. A decrease of CPE1-P means an increase in the porosity. We found that CPE1-P is 0.67 for the Pt-NPs/RGO nanohybrid-coated electrode and 0.52 for the GO-coated electrode (ESI, Fig. S3†), which are much smaller than that of the Pt-sputtered electrode, viz. 0.85. The reduction of the total internal resistance due to the decrease in the charge-transfer resistance is the cause of the increase in the fill factor (FF) of the DSCs,2,20 which confirms the increase in the conversion efficiency, as previously shown. The Rh value of the Pt-NPs/RGO nanohybrid-coated electrode was measured at a high frequency range of 2.43 Ω cm2, which is slightly lower than the value of 2.45 Ω cm2 for the GO-coated electrode. The effect is related to the Pt existence on the RGO surface, which results in bridges for facilitating electron conductivity between RGOs.40 However, the Rh of the Pt-NPs/RGO electrode is higher than the value of 2.27 Ω cm2 for the Pt-sputtered electrode. This phenomenon could be supported by sheet resistance values (ESI, Table S1†). A smaller Rh means an increase in the conductivity and results in an increase in the Jsc value.23,41

3.3. Stability of Pt-NPs/RGO nanohybrid materials
Most importantly, the Pt-NPs/RGO counter electrode shows excellent stability. The stability was confirmed by the reproducibility of the current–voltage curves over time for the redox processes at the Pt-NPs/RGO nanohybrid working electrode as shown in Fig. 7.20 No detachment of the Pt-NPs/RGO nanohybrid films from the FTO-glass was observed after the 1000th cycle20 probably due to a π–π interaction within the RGO11 (XPS data in Fig. 3), and van der Waals force between the RGO and FTO glass substrate with the aid of binder from paste and chemical bonding between Pt and RGO via functional group on the RGO surface.42 These results confirm the trends observed for the impedance characteristics, supporting the validity of our interpretation.

4. Conclusions
In summary, a highly pure Pt-NPs/RGO nanohybrid has been successfully synthesized by dry plasma reduction at low temperature. TEM results showed Pt-NPs with a size range of 0.5–4 nm (mostly 2 nm) dispersed on the surface of RGO. The long-term stability of the Pt-NPs/RGO nanohybrid electrocatalyst for triiodide reduction was clearly improved by chemical binding between the RGO and Pt-NPs. The FF of the DSC with the Pt-NPs/RGO nanohybrid electrode was the highest among the three electrodes, due to the small internal resistance of the cells. The electrochemical impedance measurement of the DSCs also revealed that the charge-transfer resistance of the Pt-NPs/RGO nanohybrid-coated electrode was the smallest. Thus, we expect that the Pt-NPs/RGO nanohybrid-coated electrode, which shows long-term stability as well as excellent energy conversion efficiency for DSCs with a small amount of Pt, can be a robust and low-cost electrode for an energy conversion device such as fuel cells or energy storage devices such as the lithium ion battery and supercapacitor.
