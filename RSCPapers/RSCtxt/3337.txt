    , Accepted 4th September 2018First published on 4th September 2018AbstractMetal halide perovskites have been intensively studied over the past years due to their attractive electronic, optical and optoelectronic properties. In spite of the phenomenally high solar-conversion efficiency achieved with perovskites, their adverse instability remains the key obstacle restricting their wider applications. These ionic crystals can be affected by many factors, such as varied temperatures, humid air, polar solvents, and electron-withdrawing/donating gases. However, under certain controlled conditions, changes in perovskite structures/compositions via, for example, phase transitions, hydration/dehydration, gas adsorption/desorption, and ion intercalation/decalation, can all be reversed, suggesting their great potential for sensing applications. In this contribution, we first overview recent investigations and mechanistic studies on the stability of metal halide perovskites under various environmental conditions. Then, we highlight the recent attempts to apply perovskites for the detection of temperature change, humidity, gases, solvents and ions. Finally, we discuss current challenges and future opportunities for developing sensing systems based on metal halide perovskites.
1. Introduction
Over the past several years, perovskites in a formula of AMX3 (Fig. 1), where each “A” (an organic group or inorganic cation) has twelve neighbouring “X” (a halide anion) and each “M” (a metal cation) connects with six adjacent “X” via ionic bonds, have attracted wide attention. Depending on whether A is an organic molecule (e.g. MA+: CH3NH3+ or FA+: CH(NH2)2+) or an inorganic cation (e.g. Cs+),1,2 they have been referred to as organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites or inorganic perovskites, respectively.3,4 As a result of the versatile ion substitution, the perovskite family includes a large number of members. These compounds have recently demonstrated a great number of attractive electronic, optical and optoelectronic properties such as tunable direct bandgaps, large absorption coefficients, long carrier diffusion lengths, long carrier lifetimes and high quantum efficiencies,2,5–13 and therefore have found a broad range of applications in solar cells,14–16 light-emitting diodes,17–21 photodetectors,10,22–26 and lasers.27,28 Since Miyasaka et al. first employed CH3NH3PbBr3 and CH3NH3PbI3 as visible-light sensitizers for nanoporous TiO2 in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) and achieved a solar energy conversion efficiency of 3.8% in 2009,29 numerous studies have contributed to the fundamental understanding of the light-harvesting processes of perovskites, as well as the development of new strategies to maximize their performances. Very recently, solar cells based on perovskites have reached remarkable power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of over 20%.30–35

In spite of the great efforts and progress made in this field, the chemical and structural instability of perovskites remains as one of the major obstacles for their further advancement. Generally, perovskites are sensitive to a number of environmental factors. For example, they may undergo phase transitions induced by temperature changes.36,37 To evaluate the stability of perovskites, a tolerance factor (t) has been proposed as , where RA, RM and RX represent the ionic radii of the ions occupying the A, M and X sites, respectively. The tolerance factors for typical perovskite materials are calculated and illustrated in Fig. 2 based on the Shannon radii of each ion.38 When t is in the range of 0.9–1, stable perovskites such as those with a cubic structure would form.39 A tolerance factor of 0.71 to 0.9 is related to a distorted perovskite structure such as a tilted octahedron.40 Considering the fact that the M site is usually occupied by a large atom of Pb or Sn, the A site must be large enough to ensure that the tolerance factor falls in the range of 0.9–1, otherwise, the cubic structure will be distorted and the crystal symmetry will be reduced. During the past couple of years, many methods have been developed to enhance the stability of perovskites, such as coating perovskites with stable and water-resistant materials like stearic acid, poly(maleic anhydride-alt-1-octadecene) (PMA), polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF), polystyrene (PS) and metal organic frameworks (MOFs), and capping them with organic ligands which not only improved the stability of perovskites but also passivated their defect sites and trapping sites.41–53 However, despite the aforementioned efforts and some success being met, the long-term stability of perovskite-based materials remains a big challenge for their practical applications. As such, the mechanism underlying the instability of perovskites needs to be fully revealed.

As the old saying goes: every cloud has a silver lining. The sensitive nature of perovskite materials in fact provides an opportunity to turn this drawback into an advantage by applying them as sensors (Fig. 3). Recently, perovskites have been reported as probes for sensing of temperature,36,37,49,54–61 humidity,58,62–68 gases,64,69–80 metal ions,81–85 solvents60,86 and explosive species.87–89 In this contribution, we discuss the stability of perovskites under different environmental conditions first, and then review the recent demonstration of using them as sensors for diverse analytes. Finally, the current challenges and future opportunities for perovskite-based sensors, in the context of long-term stability and sensitivity, are provided.

2. Environmental stability of perovskites
Understanding the origin of the intrinsic instability of perovskites towards environmental factors is of significant importance. In the following context, the effect of various factors, such as temperature, water, gases and solvents, on the stability of perovskites as well as the possible underlying mechanisms will be discussed first.
2.1 Effect of temperature
Annealing, as an important step for the fabrication of perovskite-based thin films, is usually applied to remove the excess solvent and facilitate the crystallization of perovskite structures.90–92 In addition, annealing has been reported to influence the film morphology and microstructures of perovskites.90,93,94 For example, Kim et al. found that when the annealing temperature was raised from 100 to 400 °C, a more uniform perovskite film can be formed with an increased grain size from 300 nm to 1 μm.93
Besides thermal-induced morphology change, the crystal phases of perovskites are also temperature-dependent and the structural transformation is usually accompanied by the modification of their optical and electronic properties.36,96–110 Normally, organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite crystals of CH3NH3PbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I) exist in the cubic, tetragonal, or orthorhombic phases, and transitions among them can be realized by varying the treatment temperature (Table 1).96,97 For example, CH3NH3PbI3 underwent a cubic-to-tetragonal phase transition at 330 K, and then a subsequent tetragonal-to-orthorhombic transition at 160 K.98 Such phase transitions can be attributed to the change of the tilt angle of the [PbI6]4− octahedron relative to the pseudocubic framework of CH3NH3+ ions.104 However, when exposed to elevated temperatures (e.g. 503 K) for a prolonged time, CH3NH3PbI3 would be irreversibly decomposed via the loss of CH3NH2 and HI based on thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) (Fig. 4a).111 This process can be described as eqn (1) below.92 CH3NH3PbI3 → PbI2 + CH3NH2 + HI(1)

Similar to organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites, cesium-based inorganic ones also undergo phase transitions as the temperature changes. Typically, CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, or I) crystallizes in the orthorhombic, tetragonal or cubic polymorphs.112–115 As a more specific example, CsPbBr3 displayed an orthorhombic structure at room temperature, and transformed to a tetragonal structure at 361 K and cubic structure at 403 K.97 Details on the phase transition temperatures for various CsPbX3 are summarized in Table 2.112,113,115 It is important to note that compared with organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites, cesium-based inorganic ones are thermally much more stable.116 For example, TGA analysis indicated that the decomposition of CsPbBr3 would only occur at temperatures above 873 K, which is much higher than that for CH3NH3PbBr3 (493 K) and CH3NH3PbI3 (503 K).111

The thermally induced phase transitions in perovskites can be reflected in the evolution of their PL spectra in terms of emission energy, intensity, lifetime and peak width. Xing et al. reported the temperature-dependent PL spectra of CH3NH3PbI3 nanowires as shown in Fig. 4b.36 The emission peak at 777 nm red shifted as the temperature decreased from 296 to 140 K, along with the emergence of a new peak with higher energy at about 740 nm. This new peak, associated with a new phase, i.e. the orthorhombic perovskite structure, red-shifted with increasing intensity as the temperature further decreased from 140 to 77 K.
Apart from phase transitions, blue shifts and broadening of PL peaks have been generally observed for perovskites under increasing temperatures,101,105–107,109,117 such as in the case of CH(NH2)2PbBr3 as shown in Fig. 4c.105 This is opposite to most conventional semiconductors, such as Si, Ge and GaAs, which show red shifts of emission peaks with increasing temperature mainly due to lattice dilation.118–123 As suggested by several experimental and theoretical investigations, the thermally-induced blue-shift of PL peaks for most perovskites could be due to competition between lattice expansion and electron–phonon coupling.101,107,117 Meanwhile, the broadening of the peaks might be attributed to the increased acoustic/optical phonon interactions and phonon scattering.105,109 Moreover, reduced PL intensity at higher temperatures was observed as well (Fig. 4c), due to thermally activated nonradioactive recombination.105 Thermally-induced quenching could also result from the loss of ligands on the nanocrystal surfaces, which was irreversible once the ligands were removed.106
In other examples, higher temperatures were found to cause increased interaction of excitons with trap states and lead to prolonged emission lifetimes.108,124 For example, Shi et al. reported that the PL lifetime of CsPbBr3 increased from 2 to 13 ns as the temperature was raised from 10 to 300 K (Fig. 4d).108 However, when the temperature was increased further, the PL lifetime would decrease due to thermal degradation of the perovskite nanocrystals.
Besides the temperature-dependent luminescent properties, Li et al. systematically studied the carrier mobility of CH3NH3PbI3 under different temperatures and found that the mobility continuously increased with decreasing temperature from 300 to 180K, then suddenly dropped at ∼170K, and increased again as the temperature was reduced further (Fig. 4e).110 Again, the sudden decrease of mobility was associated with a structural phase transition from the tetragonal to orthorhombic phase which induced the change of effective mass and dielectric constant.
2.2 Effect of water
It is well accepted that water is one of the major causes of the instability of metal halide perovskites. A great number of studies have thus been conducted to investigate the degradation processes, with the aim to understand the underlying mechanisms and thus find ways to overcome the instability issue.64,65,68,73,125–127
Previous simulation results indicated that water molecules could permeate into the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite lattices and form hydrogen bonds with CH3NH3+ and I− ions.74,128 Differently, Frost et al. proposed that a water molecule might act as a Lewis base and take away one proton from ammonium in CH3NH3PbI3, forming an intermediate, i.e. [(CH3NH3+)n−1(CH3NH2)nPbI3][H3O+]. The intermediate could further decompose into HI, CH3NH2 and PbI2.125 Niu et al. suggested a different degradation process by considering the effects of air and sunlight. CH3NH3PbI3 might firstly decompose into aqueous CH3NH3I and PbI2 (eqn (2)), and the aqueous CH3NH3I further decompose into aqueous CH3NH2 and HI (eqn (3)), which finally would decompose to I2 and H2O in the presence of O2 (eqn (4)), or I2 and H2 under light irradiation (eqn (5)).126 Later on, several studies suggested that before the complete decomposition of CH3NH3PbI3 to PbI2, which is an irreversible process,68,127 a series of hydration processes would take place in the dark environment. This involved the formation of intermediate CH3NH3PbI3·H2O (eqn (6)) followed by (CH3NH3)4PbI6·2H2O, based on detailed characterizations with X-ray diffraction and infrared spectroscopy combined with theoretical predictions.65,73,127 The formation of monohydrate intermediates was also proposed by Hu et al. where mixed halide perovskite CH3NH3PbI3−xClx could absorb water to form CH3NH3PbI3−xClx·H2O, and this process could be reversed by exposing the perovskite to N2 gas.68 As mentioned above, several possible degradation pathways have been proposed. It can be seen that the degradation process is highly dependent on the environmental conditions.129 For example, even a slight change in humidity, or switching between light and dark conditions might cause different intermediate or final products. (2) CH3NH3I(aq) ⇔ CH3NH2(aq) + HI(aq)(3) 4HI(aq) + O2 ⇔ 2I2(s) + 2H2O(4) (5) 4CH3NH3PbI3 + 2H2O ⇔ (CH3NH3)4PbI6·2H2O + 3PbI2(6)
Christians et al. and Yang et al. both systematically studied the dependency of the degradation rate on the period and intensity of the moisture exposure.65,127 For example, complete decomposition of CH3NH3PbI3 took more than 20 days at a relative humidity (RH) of ∼50%, and less than 5 days at a RH of over 90%.65
Compared with the aforementioned organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites, their inorganic counterparts are relatively less affected by water.130,131 Shan et al. compared the humidity stability of light-emitting diodes (LEDs) based on all-inorganic and organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites, and found that the former could preserve 70% of its original luminescence for 1.75 h at a RH of 65% and survived in water for about 20 s, whereas the latter degraded to 70% of its original luminescence more rapidly within 30 min and could survive for only less than 2 s in water.130 Despite the slightly better stability, surface capping strategies have to be applied to inorganic metal-halide perovskites before their practical use.132,133
It is interesting that although water molecules can degrade perovskites, they have also been reported to assist the formation of high quality perovskite films.129,134–136 Bass et al. reported that the crystallinity of cubic-phased CH3NH3PbBr3 or tetragonal-phased CH3NH3PbI3 can be improved by annealing them under a 58.2% humidity compared to those annealed in Ar.135 Similarly, You et al. reported that annealing CH3NH3PbI3−xClx films under a controlled humid condition could greatly enhance the film quality in terms of carrier mobility and emission lifetime.136 Improved film roughness and uniformity have also been realized by fine control over the content of hydration water in the precursor solution.137 These results indicate that the presence of a trace amount of water molecules may benefit the crystallization of perovskite films, although the mechanism is yet not fully understood.
2.3 Effect of gaseous environments
The preparation of organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites is usually carried out in glove box with the protection of inert gases,138 because H2O molecules together with O2 in air accelerate the degradation process of perovskites.139 Such degradation is so severe that, within one day, a typical CH3NH3PbI3 film left under ambient conditions could decompose to PbI2, and as observed by the naked eye, its color changed from deep-brown to bright-yellow (Fig. 5).140 Substituting I with Br could improve the stability of perovskites, but still, as reported by Sheng et al. prolonged air exposure (e.g. a few weeks) caused a much increased defect density in a CH3NH3PbBr3 film, leading to a lower PL intensity and shorter lifetime compared to the film stored in N2.141 To eliminate the effect of H2O, Zhou et al. compared the PCE of CH3NH3PbI3−xClx perovskite devices stored in dry air and those stored in N2, and found that the PCE of the former still deteriorated more rapidly than that of the latter, confirming the negative effect of O2.15 However, several groups reported rather contradictory observations.75,142–144 Motti and colleagues presented that exposure of CH3NH3PbBr3 to air could enhance its PL, which was quenched again when the air flow was switched back to N2.142 They proposed that such enhancement could be attributed to the fact that O2 molecules might react with and thus passivate defect carriers. Similarly, Fang et al. suggested that the physisorption of O2 and H2O on the CH3NH3PbBr3 film surface could lead to the passivation of the surface charge traps.75 Moreover, Tian et al. pointed out that O2 molecules could diffuse into the interior of CH3NH3PbI3 and passivate the trap states both on the surface and in the interior, leading to an obvious PL enhancement in air compared to that in Ar.144

The exposure of organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites to other small gas molecules, for example NH3,69,70,72 has been studied as well. Zhao et al. reported that NH3 molecules could intercalate into the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite structure and form a new coordination complex.70 This caused a substantial decrease in the film UV-vis absorption over the whole 400–800 nm range, which returned to its original level upon the removal of NH3. However, when the perovskite film was continuously exposed to NH3, its color changed irreversibly due to the transformation of CH3NH3PbI3 to a new and unknown compound. In other reports, CH3NH3PbI3 + NH3,69 NH4PbI3·H2O145 and NH4PbX3·CH3NH2146 have been identified as new phases formed due to exposing hybrid perovskites to NH3. Interestingly, Huang et al. found that if CH3NH3PbI3 was exposed to high pressure NH3 (600 mbar), it would convert to NH4PbI3via cation exchange and revert back to CH3NH3PbI3 after being exposed to CH3NH2.72 More detailed information on gas-induced formation/transformation of organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites can be found in a recent review article by Zhou et al.147
Different from NH3 gas molecules, which can diffuse into and thus react with perovskite structures, other volatile polar compounds with relatively larger molecular sizes mainly interact with perovskites on their grain surfaces via hydrogen bonding.76,148,149 For example, Kim et al. found that the PL intensity of CH3NH3PbI3 was remarkably quenched by 65.2% after being exposed to pyridine vapour within one second. Because of the weak hydrogen bonding between them, the color change of the CH3NH3PbI3 film from dark brown to transparent could be easily reversed by removing pyridine.148 After a more systematic study, Yu et al. put forward that the extent of interaction between CH3NH3PbI3 and pyridine could be controlled by varying the partial pressure of pyridine vapor. When the pyridine pressure was 1.15 Torr or below, the reaction took place mostly on the surface of CH3NH3PbI3 and generated PbI2 surrounding the CH3NH3PbI3 core. When the pyridine pressure was 1.3 Torr or higher, the pyridine vapor could transform the whole CH3NH3PbI3 film to PbI2 after a short incubation period (within a couple of minutes).149 In another report, Kim et al. investigated the fluorescence response of CH3NH3PbBr3 to different aliphatic amines (EtNH2, Et2NH and Et3N) and found that all of them caused fast fluorescent quenching of CH3NH3PbBr3 due to the hydrogen bonding between protons in amines and nitrogen in CH3NH3+.76 Notably, fluorescent quenching of CH3NH3PbBr3 upon Et3N exposure was reversible, whereas that under EtNH2 exposure was irreversible. This might be because the hydrogen bonding between CH3NH3PbBr3 and Et3N was weaker with a longer bonding distance compared to that between CH3NH3PbBr3 and EtNH2.
2.4 Effect of solvents
Because of their ionic solid nature, perovskites are prone to lose structural integrity in polar solvents such as water and alcohols.46,133,150–153 Kim et al. centrifuged CsPbBr3 crude solution with different polar solvents and found that the solvent not only influences the dispersity of CsPbBr3 nanocrystals but also their luminescence properties.150 As shown in Fig. 6, in sharp contrast to weak polar solvents (e.g. isopropyl alcohol, 1-butanol, acetone, and acetonitrile), in which CsPbBr3 nanocrystals were better dispersed and gave bright emission under UV irradiation, strong polar solvents like dimethyl sulfoxide and dimethylformamide caused degeneration/precipitation of the nanocrystals and loss of their luminescent properties. Mei et al. reported that the emission peak of CsPbBr3 QDs was located at 510 nm when they were dissolved in hexane, octadecene and ether, however, a new emission center emerged at 410 nm when they were dissolved in acetone and ethanol.152 The blue-shift of the emission center can be ascribed to the hydrogen bonding between –NH2 groups on CsPbBr3 QDs and solvents with higher polarity. Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites are even more vulnerable to polar solvents. Kim et al. found that the solvent-induced degradation of CH3NH3PbI3 to PbI2 and accompanying color change proceeded faster in polar alcohols like MeOH compared to in less polar ones like n-BuOH.151 To address the issue of polar solvent induced degradation, Luo et al. capped CH3NH3PbBr3 nanocrystals with organic ligands (e.g. 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane and polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane) to increase their stability.133 Within a short period (30 min) of alcohol exposure, the fluorescent intensity of the crystals remained, but unfortunately, it started to decrease severely after ∼2.5 h of exposure. In another work, Hou et al. capped CsPbBr3 NCs with multidentate polymer micelles (polystyrene-block-poly-2-vinylpyridine (PS-b-P2VP)) in toluene. Within a short period (∼2 min), the perovskite colloids showed excellent stability when a polar solvent (i.e. ethanol, IPA or methanol) was added at a toluene/polar solvent volume ratio of 1:1. With further increasing of the polarity of the solvent mixture (1:10), the colloidal stability decreased and almost no fluorescence could be observed in the toluene/methanol mixture.153

As mentioned above, the properties of metal halide perovskites can be affected by many factors, such as temperature, humidity, solvents, and electron-withdrawing/donating gases. Therefore, many efforts have been made to improve the stability of perovskites. For example, trioctylphosphine oxide (TOPO) was used as a capping agent for CsPbBr3 NCs which showed good stability against ethanol.154 Besides, the encapsulation method has also been applied to improve the stability of perovskites. For instance, compared with pristine CsPbBr3 NCs, CsPbBr3 NC/AlOx nanocomposites retained their high quantum yield after 45 days of storage in air.45 Additionally, the encapsulation of perovskites with other materials may not only increase the stability, but also endow the material with new functions. For example, encapsulating CsPbBr3 perovskite quantum dots in a PMMA fiber membrane allowed the fabrication of stable sensors in water for detection of proteins, metal ions and pH values.155
3. Sensing applications of perovskites
It can be seen from the above sections that in addition to the compositional/structural changes, optical properties such as emission energy and electrical properties such as resistance of the perovskites also vary upon exposure to external stimuli and many of these processes are reversible. This makes perovskites potential candidates for sensing applications. Till now, perovskites have been ventured to detect a variety of analytes, such as temperature, humidity, gases, solvents, metal ions and explosives. Typical examples are summarized in Table 3.

3.1 Perovskites as potential temperature sensors
Temperature sensors are needed in diverse fields such as environmental temperature measurements, biomedical sensing, and thermal monitoring of microprocessors.157–159 As mentioned in previous Section 2.1, organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites generally show reversible phase transitions upon changes of temperature, which can be reflected in their PL spectra.36,104,160–162 This property makes them suitable for fluorescent temperature sensors. Niu et al. fabricated a TSP (temperature sensor paint) based on (CnH2n+1NH3)2PbI4 (n = 4, 12, 16, and 18) and the temperature dependent PL can be observed by the naked eye (Fig. 7a).60 Its emission intensity gradually decreased as the temperature increased from 0 to 60 °C with good linearity (Fig. 7b). Importantly, the sensor showed good reversibility for both intensity change and emission wavelength change during repeated heating and cooling cycles (Fig. 7c), but at above 60 °C, thermal quenching was observed. Not only used as a florescent temperature sensor, the TSP could also be used for thermal imaging. When coated on an aluminum radiator on a hot plate, the original green luminescent TSP was thermally quenched, giving rise to a dotted grey pattern and the greyness correlated to the relative temperature at that particular spot (Fig. 7d). Importantly, this dotted pattern showed comparable resolution with that obtained from a conventional infrared imager (Fig. 7e), indicating the potential use of TSP for reliable temperature imaging. In another work, Huang et al. reported Mn-doped CsPb(Cl/Br)3 NCs. As shown in Fig. 7f, with increasing temperature from 5 to 50 °C, the intrinsic emission intensity of perovskite NCs at 440 nm decreased gradually and the emission peak redshifted due to the thermally activated trapping of charge carriers and the thermal expansion of the crystalline lattice, respectively. However, the emission from Mn-dopants (572 nm) showed an opposite behaviour. This peak blueshifted with increasing temperature caused by thermal expansion of the crystalline lattice. Due to the overlap between the emission spectra of the perovskite and Mn, the elevated temperature promoted the energy transfer between the perovskite (donor) and Mn (acceptor). The emission ratio (Fig. 7f) between the perovskite and Mn showed a linear relationship with temperature which was used successfully to detect temperature change.61

3.2 Humidity sensors
Humidity monitoring devices find wide applications in forecasting climate change, food safety, and various industrial processes.163–166 Although perovskites are prone to water-induced irreversible degradation, controlled exposure could enable reversible intercalation/absorption of water molecules in perovskites. Xu et al. fabricated a fluorescent humidity sensor with CH3NH3PbBr3 which emitted strong green light at ∼530 nm at a RH of ∼7%.67 When the RH increased from 7% to 98%, the emission color, as directly observable by the naked eye, changed from bright to dark green and then from green to brown by using FTPP (5,10,15,20-tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)porphyrin) as the background (Fig. 8a). As shown in the corresponding PL spectra (Fig. 8b), both a blue-shift and intensity reduction in the emission peak were observed with increasing RH, following a linear relationship (Fig. 8c). Such quenching was suggested as a static process based on the invariant emission lifetime under dry or humid conditions (Fig. 8d). The change of fluorescence intensity showed good reversibility for at least 10 cycles (Fig. 8e), and the limit of detection was as low as 0.04% RH. In another report by Grancini et al., CH3NH3PbI3 showed a broad and asymmetric emission peak at 795 nm in vacuum, and after being exposed to a humid environment, its emission blue shifted remarkably (Fig. 8f) and the dynamic decay time decreased with the increasing of humidity (Fig. 8g and h).62 This observation was contradictory to the aforementioned static quenching of CH3NH3PbBr3.67 This disparity may originate from the different interaction between H2O molecules and the two kinds of perovskite crystals, i.e. CH3NH3PbBr3 and CH3NH3PbI3. Indeed, while water molecules were suggested to absorb strongly on the CH3NH3PbI3 surface167 and enter the structure interior to form a partially hydrated phase,62 water only weakly interacted with CH3NH3PbBr3via physisorption rather than chemisorption.75

Besides the change of PL emission, resistance change has also been used as an indicator for sensing of humidity. Some reports suggested that H2O molecules could intercalate into the perovskite film lattices, and thus affect the charge conduction,68 whereas other reports indicated that the absorption of H2O molecules could inject electrons, raise the Fermi level, and hence enhance the sensor conductivity.66 More specifically, Hu et al. demonstrated that when a perovskite film (CH3NH3PbI3−xClx) was exposed to moisture for a short time, due to the chemisorption and hydration process, the resistance of the film decreased. This change could be subsequently recovered when dry N2 was pumped in again (Fig. 9a).68 In terms of repeatability, a slight decrease of the response was observed in the first 3 cycles, due to the partial formation of a new and stable phase of CH3NH3PbI3·H2O. The sensing response then remained relatively stable in the rest of the cycles (Fig. 9b). Recently, Ren et al. fabricated humidity sensors based on vertically aligned CH3NH3PbI3−xClx nanosheet arrays.66 Owing to the largely exposed surface areas (Fig. 9c), the sensitivity and response of the vertical array towards H2O were much higher than that of a planar structure. The sensor also exhibited a fast response time of ∼24 s to reach the response maxima, and good cycling stability (Fig. 9d) due to the reversible formation of CH3NH3PbI3−xClx·H2O. In such a sensing system, again, the absorbed H2O molecules were believed to inject electrons, raise the Fermi level and thus enhance the conductivity of perovskites (Fig. 9e).

3.3 Perovskite gas sensors
Gas sensors find a wide range of applications in the fields of monitoring air quality,168–171 diagnosing clinical gases172–174 and detecting toxic gases.175–177 Up to now, several perovskite gas sensors have been reported, and most of them are based on chemiresistive sensing or optical sensing.71,77–80,95 Possible sensing mechanisms include doping,78,79 gas-induced defect reparation,77 trap passivation,80 and ion-exchange.71
Due to the comparable effective masses of electrons and holes, perovskites behave as ambipolar charge transporters,178–180 and therefore, both electron-withdrawing and electron-donating molecules can effectively manipulate charge carrier densities. For example, Zhuang et al. developed a gas sensing system based on CH3NH3PbI3−x(SCN)x, whose resistance decreased upon exposure to acetone or NO2 with a minimum detectable concentration of 20 ppm and 200 ppb, respectively. This can be attributed to the electron-donating and electron-withdrawing nature of acetone and NO2, respectively.78
Different from the doping-related sensing mechanism, Kakavelakis et al. suggested that ozone molecules could passivate the traps (unpaired Pb2+ ions) within the CH3NH3PbI3−xClx lattices and thus enhance the charge transport and reduce charge recombination.80 Resultantly, the current of the sensor increased after being exposed to ozone and self-recovered without the need of pumping an inert gas. Similarly for O2 sensing, Stoeckel et al. found that iodine vacancies on CH3NH3PbI3 surfaces could be healed by O2 molecules, leading to a resistance reduction.77 The current of the perovskite channel decreased with a decrease of O2 concentration, with a fast response time of ∼0.4 s and a detection limit of ∼70 ppm. When O2 was removed, the resistance of the perovskite film could recover to the original value, indicating that the trapping process is fully reversible.
The perovskite chemiresistive gas sensor can be further activated by light-irradiation. For example, Chen et al. employed a porous CsPbBr3 network as a light-activated O2 sensor (Fig. 10a).95 As shown in Fig. 10b, the CsPbBr3 sensor under visible light illumination showed a pronouncedly improved response to O2 compared to that in the dark, due to the photo-induced pumping of charge carriers and desorption of unwanted surface species. The resulting sensor afforded a relatively fast response time and recovery time of 17.4 s and 127.9 s, respectively, (Fig. 10c), along with good stability and repeatability (Fig. 10d), as well as a linear response and a minimum detectable concentration of 1% O2 (Fig. 10e).

Besides chemiresistive sensors, optical gas sensors based on perovskites have also been explored.70,71,145 Chen et al. developed a HCl vapor sensor by using CsPbBr3 nanocrystals based on the anion-exchange reaction. More specifically, when CsPbBr3 was exposed to HCl vapor, Br− ions were partially substituted by the gaseous Cl− ions.71 This exchange reaction caused a blue-shift of its PL emission peak, and the amount of shift (Δλ) depended strongly on the HCl concentration. This observation was in line with previous findings that the optical properties of CsPbX3 were tunable through compositional change.181,182 Furthermore, the sensor showed a low detection limit of 5 ppm and good selectivity towards HCl compared to other volatile acids and bases such as HNO3, CH3COOH and NH4OH.
As mentioned in previous Section 2.3, exposing organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites to NH3 gas can cause the partial and reversible replacement of the organic cations in perovskites with NH4+.145 This usually led to the PL quenching of the perovskites, thus making them suitable for fabrication of optical NH3 sensors.146 In a very recent study by Sasmal et al., layered two-dimensional (2D) hybrid perovskites based on linear alkylammoniums, e.g. (C8H17NH3)2PbI4 or (OA)2PbI4, were explored for sensing NH3.145 A reversible structure/composition change between (OA)2PbI4 and NH4PbI3·H2O was observed as NH3 was turned on and off, which was also reflected in the switch of the film color between green and dark (Fig. 11a and b). Excellent stability and a fast response were also achieved during cyclical switching on and off of the NH3 gas. Based on a detailed mechanistic study, the authors suggested that the much improved reversibility and stability of the layered hybrid perovskites based on long chain alkylammoniums as compared to conventional 3D perovskites like CH3NH3PbI3, could be due to the following two reasons. First, the decomposed OA from (OA)2PbI4 is less volatile compared to CH3NH2 decomposed from CH3NH3PbI3, and hence OA can more readily recombine with PbI4 to give a layered perovskite structure. Second, the layered structure with flexibly packed alkyl chains provides more voids for percolation of NH3 molecules into the perovskite lattices and ensured a fast and reversible exchange of protons between OA+ and NH3.

The working principles of optical gas sensors based on perovskites are not limited to the aforementioned ion exchange. Gas adsorption induced manipulation of excitons was recently demonstrated by Lin et al. in MnII-doped CsPbCl3 nanocrystals (Mn:CsPbCl3 NCs) upon O2 exposure.156 As shown in Fig. 11c, absorbed O2 molecules not only disturbed the exciton recombination of the host CsPbCl3 crystals, but also quenched the MnII dopants via direct interaction and probably energy transfer. Consequently, the resulting sensor showed a good response towards O2. Good reversibility and a fast response were also achieved. Within 5 s, 97% of the phosphorescence intensity was quenched, and 84% of it could be recovered within 10 s after O2 was removed (Fig. 11d).
3.4 Perovskite sensors for solvent content
The sensitivity of perovskite crystals to their solvation conditions has enabled the development of sensors for solvent content.60,86 Niu et al. took advantage of the aggregation-induced emission (AIE) feature of (C16H33NH3)2PbI4 and used it as a fluorescent probe for water.60 When (C16H33NH3)2PbI4 was dissolved in a good solvent like THF, a non-emissive and transparent solution was formed, but a yellow precipitate was produced upon the addition of water as a poor solvent (Fig. 12a). As schematically shown in Fig. 12b, PbI2 first interacted with CnH2n+1NH3I to form hybrid perovskites, which were well separated in THF, and aggregated into a layered quantum-well structure when water was introduced. Remarkably, when the content of water was more than 70%, a dramatic increase in the PL emission was detected (Fig. 12c and d). Based on a different mechanism, Asmir et al. found that the fluorescence peak of CsCuBr3 at 349 nm was enhanced by the addition of water to DMF due to the fact that water is a better electron donor as compared to DMF.86 For comparison, the PL intensity of CsCuBr3 decreased in other solvents such as dichloromethane, chloroform, toluene, hexane, ethanol and acetone, which indicates the good selectivity of the perovskite sensor towards water.

3.5 Perovskite sensors for metal ions
Many metal ions are essential to biological systems,183,184 such as copper (Cu2+), iron (Fe3+) and zinc (Zn2+), while some other toxic metal ions,185 such as mercury (Hg2+), chromium (Cr6+) and lead (Pb2+) may threaten human health and pollute the environment due to their high toxicity. Very recently, perovskites have been used as sensing probes for metal ions.81–85 Lu et al. successfully demonstrated using CH3NH3PbBr3 quantum dots (QDs) for the detection of mercury ions (Hg2+).82 The QDs emitted bright green fluorescence originally. Hg2+ ions could replace Pb2+ on the QD surfaces via ion-exchange, leading to partial fluorescence quenching. Remarkably, the sensor exhibited a low detection limit of 24.87 ppt and good selectivity towards Hg2+ compared to Cd2+, Pb2+ and Cu2+. Similarly based on ion exchange, Aamir et al. developed a sensor for Pb2+ ions by using a relatively weak fluorescent emitting material, i.e. CsCuCl3.84 In the presence of Pb2+ ions, the partial replacement of Cu2+ by Pb2+ led to the formation of CsPbCl3 domains which emitted fluorescence more strongly compared to CsCuCl3, thus leading to detectable PL change.
Very differently, Sheng et al. prepared fluorescent sensors for Cu2+ ions by using CsPbBr3 QDs based on defect-induced fluorescent quenching (Fig. 13a and b).83 The Cu2+ ions were suggested to induce surface defects which acted as efficient nonradiative recombination centers. It is worth mentioning that this sensor was highly selective towards Cu2+, as 16 other tested cations like Ag+ and Mg2+ showed negligible response (Fig. 13c and d). Importantly, the sensor could be recycled by the addition of oleylamine which bonds more strongly with CsPbBr3 QDs than Cu2+. In another work, Liu et al. suggested that the electron transfer between CsPbBr3 and Cu2+ could be another possible reason that caused the PL quenching of CsPbBr3 QDs.85

In a recent report, Wang et al. firstly encapsulated CsPbBr3 QDs into polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) through an electrospinning method to enhance the durability of CsPbBr3 QDs against water.155 Cyclam was then functionalized on the surface of the CsPbBr3 QD/PMMA fiber membrane (CPBQD/PMMA FM) for the detection of Cu2+via fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). Specifically, the absorption energy of the cyclam–Cu2+ complex matched well with the emission energy of the CPBQD/PMMA FM, and therefore, the reduction of the florescence of CPBQD/PMMA FM could be used as an indicator of the Cu2+ concentration.
3.6 Perovskite sensors for explosive species
Nitro aromatics such as 2,4-dinitrotoluene (DNT), 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) and 2,4,6-trinitrophenol (TNP), the most potent explosives used for making lethal weapons, are dangerous to wildlife and human health due to their biological persistence and toxicity.186 Reliable sensing techniques for explosive species are therefore in great need. Muthu et al. used CH3NH3PbBr3 nanoparticles for the detection of TNP.88 The electron transfer from CH3NH3PbBr3 to TNP, which interacted via hydrogen bonding, resulted in effective luminescent quenching. A detection limit as low as 10−15 M was achieved for TNP along with a good selectivity as evidenced by the fact that the quenching efficiency towards 0.1 mM TNP, DNT and TNT, was 97%, 5%, and 9%, respectively. Moreover, the absorption of organic molecules on CH3NH3PbI3 could induce surface-enhanced infrared absorption (SEIRA). This property was recently successfully utilized in the detection of explosives like nitroaromatic molecules by Chen et al.89
4. Conclusion and outlook
Metal halide perovskites have found a wide range of applications including solar cells, light-emitting diodes, photodetectors and lasers. They are sensitive to various external perturbations such as humidity, temperature, gases and solvents. In this review, we have firstly discussed how these environmental factors affect the stability of perovskites and the possible underlying mechanisms. Typically, temperature can cause the phase transition and decomposition of perovskites. Polar solvents (e.g. H2O, DMF) and active gases (e.g. O2, NH3) are easily absorbed on the surfaces of perovskites to modify their surface defects and traps; they also can penetrate or intercalate into the interior of the perovskite lattices to give the intercalated, hydrated or intermediate complexes which can reverse back to perovskites before irreversible decomposition. This reversibility, although limited, gives perovskites sensing abilities.
We then provided an overview of the recent exploration of using perovskites for sensing temperature change, humidity, gases, ions, and so on. It can be seen from the examples that, when subjected to controlled exposure to these external factors, processes such as phase change, intercalation/decalation, adsorption/desorption and hydration/dehydration can all be reversed. This is a prerequisite for the development of reliable and recoverable sensing systems. Recent studies already indicated the potential of using perovskite sensors for practical uses. For example, the detection limit of a perovskite ozone sensor, i.e. 5 ppb, is more than an order of magnitude below the 75 ppb mark imposed by international agencies.80 The precision of a perovskite Cu2+ sensor is comparable to that of inductively coupled plasma (ICP) measurement.83
Despite the great potential of using perovskites as sensing materials, improving their long term stability remains a key challenge. Over the past couple of years, strategies such as surface passivation, doping, and forming heterostructures have been used to enhance the stability of perovskites. In addition, it has been reported that, compared to 3D perovskites, layered 2D perovskites with the formula of R2(CH3NH3)n−1MnX3n+1 where R is an organic group, M is a divalent metal cation (Cu2+, Mn2+, Sn2+, and Pb2+) and X is a halide (Cl−, Br− or I−), offer better environmental stability against oxygen and moisture due to the long-chain organic cations. Moreover, 2D perovskites have recently demonstrated promising sensing ability in addition to the good stability.60,145,187 For example, Sasmal et al. used a linear alkyl ammonium based layered perovskite (e.g. (OA)2PbI4) for sensing NH3, which showed much improved stability compared to (CH3NH3)PbI4, without sacrificing its high sensitivity towards NH3 and good reversibility.145 Hybridizing perovskites with other functional materials such as porous membranes could also be exploited, in order to finely control the level of exposure and thus keep the modification of perovskite properties within a reversible window. Besides, considering the fact that metal halide perovskites can be affected by many factors, development of sensors that can work under real complex environments is challenging and important.
With continuous efforts devoted to the rational design and preparation of stable perovskites with novel compositional and structural properties, it is believed that their ability to transduce external stimuli to electrical/optical signals in a highly reversible and reliable manner will be realized in the near future to enable robust and powerful sensing platforms.
