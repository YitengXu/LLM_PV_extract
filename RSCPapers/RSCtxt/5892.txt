The resulting cross section at a temperature of 296 K over the wavelength range from 240 to 370 nm is given by log10(σ(IONO2)/cm2 molecule−1) = 170.4 − 3.773 λ + 2.965 × 10−2λ2
				− 1.139 × 10−4λ3 + 2.144 × 10−7λ4
				− 1.587 × 10−10λ5, where λ is in nm; the cross section, with 2σ uncertainty, ranges from (6.5 ± 1.9) × 10−18 cm2 at 240 nm to (5 ± 3) × 10−19 cm2 at 350 nm, and is significantly lower than a previous measurement [J. C. Mössinger, D. M. Rowley and R. A. Cox, Atmos. Chem. Phys., 2002, 2, 227]. The photolysis quantum yields for IO and NO3 production at 248 nm were measured using laser induced fluorescence of IO at 445 nm, and cavity ring-down spectroscopy of NO3 at 662 nm, yielding ϕ(IO) ≤ 0.02 and ϕ(NO3) = 0.21 ± 0.09. It is likely that photolysis to I + NO3 is the only significant channel, as shown by accompanying quantum chemistry calculations. The low ϕ(NO3) is explained by the production of hot NO3, most of which dissociates to NO2 + O. In terms of atmospheric relevance, the noon photolysis frequency of J(IONO2) = (3.0 ± 2.1) × 10−3 s−1 (40° N, July) is fast enough to limit the effectiveness of IONO2 as a daytime reservoir of iodine oxides, but the formation and subsequent photolysis of IONO2 is very inefficient as an ozone-depleting cycle.IntroductionRecent observations of the iodine monoxide (IO) and dioxide (OIO) radicals in the marine boundary layer provide direct evidence for the participation of gaseous inorganic iodine in tropospheric photochemistry.1–7 The major sources of atmospheric iodine appear to be molecular iodine (I2), and biogenic iodocarbons such as CH2I2, CH2ICl and CH3I, which evade from open ocean and coastal waters.4,8,9 These molecules photolyse to yield I atoms, which then react with O3 to form IO. One major interest is the potential role of iodine in the destruction of tropospheric ozone via three catalytic cycles initiated by the reactions of IO with HO2, NO2, or with itself.10–12In this paper we will focus on the potential for ozone depletion by the cycle involving iodine nitrate (IONO2):
 (1) (2a) (2b) (2c) (3)O3 depletion will only be significant if atomic iodine is the dominant photolysis product of IONO2 (channel 2b rather than 2a), because atomic iodine will go on to react with O3 to reform IO through reaction (3). However, the NO3 fragment formed will photolyse to NO2 + O with a branching ratio of 0.9.13 The resulting atomic oxygen will recombine with O2 to form O3, which will thus reduce the overall O3-depleting effect of channel 2b. Recent high-level quantum chemistry calculations, including a treatment of spin–orbit coupling, report a new heat of formation for IONO2, ΔH298 Kf = 32.5 kJ mol−1 (N. Kaltsoyannis, University College London, personal communication), about 12 kJ mol−1 lower than a recent literature value.14 The threshold for channel 2a is then 117 kJ mol−1, and that for channel 2b is 131 kJ mol−1, so both channels could potentially be open to photolysis throughout the visible region of the spectrum. Although channel 2c is, in principle, accessible (threshold = 167 kJ mol−1), this channel involves significant internal rearrangement and should have a large barrier.15The absolute absorption cross section of IONO2 was measured for the first time quite recently.16 Over the wavelength range 240 to 415 nm, the cross section at 298 K decreased monotonically from 1.1 × 10−17 to 6.0 × 10−19 cm2 molecule−1. The spectrum was considerably larger (by a factor of ∼10 at 245 nm), and red-shifted by ∼180 nm (or 200 kJ mol−1) from the absorption spectrum of BrONO2,17 which, in turn, is red-shifted by ∼30 nm from the spectrum of ClONO2.18 Although the lack of vibrational structure in the IONO2 absorption band implies that it is photodissociative, the quantum yields of channels 2a and 2b are unknown.In this paper we will report a new measurement of the absolute cross section of IONO2 from 240–370 nm. The quantum yield for the photolysis products I + NO3 (channel 2b) will be shown to be at least 95% at 248 nm. The experimental results will then be interpreted using quantum chemistry calculations of the first electronically-excited state of IONO2. Finally, the photolysis frequency (J(IONO2)) will be calculated and the atmospheric implications discussed.ExperimentalIONO2 was prepared in situ by the laser flash photolysis of a mixture of CF3I and NO2, using an ArF excimer laser (Lambda Physik Compex 201, repetition rate = 1–3 Hz, fluence = (0.1–2.6) × 1016 cm−2) at 193 nm:14 (4) (5) (1)There were two principal reasons for choosing this method to produce IONO2. First, NO2 is required in relatively high concentration for reaction (1), and its modest photolysis cross section at 193 nm (2.5 × 10−19 cm2 molecule−119) therefore provides a source of O(3P) atoms for reaction (5). Second, alternative iodine-atom sources, such as I2, CH2I2 and CH3I which can be used to produce IO by reaction with atomic oxygen, have much larger photolysis cross sections at 193 nm than CF3I.20 Since a relatively large concentration of the iodine-atom source is required to compete with the reaction between atomic oxygen and NO2 (see below), the photolysis of the iodine-atom source should be minimised in order to avoid secondary radical chemistry.The absorption spectrum of IONO2 was recorded using time-resolved Fourier transform spectroscopy in an absorption cell of length 122 cm with quartz end-windows, as shown in Fig. 1. The spectroscopic source was a deuterium lamp which, after transiting the cell, was focused into a Fourier transform spectrometer (Bruker, Model IFS 66). The spectrometer was operated in the rapid-scan mode (512 scans to build up a foward, backward double-sided split interferogram) to record a spectrum between 12.6 and 38.0 ms after each excimer laser pulse. Spectra were recorded with 30 cm−1 resolution i.e., a resolution of ∼0.2 nm at 240 nm, reducing to ∼0.4 nm at 370 nm. The ArF excimer laser beam was directed onto and then off the cell axis using dichroic mirrors M1 and M2 (Fig. 1). The beam from the deuterium lamp was collimated with a lens before entering the absorption cell, and then apertured down (diameter 5 mm) to ensure that the light focused into the spectrometer by the spherical mirror (M3) was within the excimer beam in the cell. The excimer laser fluence in the cell was measured using a power meter (Molectron Power Max), through a 10 mm diameter aperture. The calibration of the power meter was compared with a second identical meter, as well as a Molectron J50 pyro-electric joulemeter. All three meters agreed within 5%. The gas residence time in the cell and the laser repetition rate were adjusted to ensure that the gas mixture was exposed to an average of ∼1 laser shot, confirmed from the measured depletion of NO2 in the rapid-scan spectrum. Fig. 1  Schematic diagram of the apparatus used to measure the absorption cross section of IONO2. The molecule was produced in the cell with quartz end windows by excimer laser photolysis of a NO2/CF3I mixture. The time-resolved UV-visible absorption spectrum was measured by a Bruker IFS 66 Fourier transform spectrometer with a deuterium lamp as the spectroscopic light source. M1 and M2 are dichroic mirrors reflecting at 193 nm. M3 is a parabolic mirror which focused the light from the deuterium lamp into the spectrometer. The apparatus shown in Fig. 2 was used to study the photofragments of IONO2 photodissociation at 248 nm. As before, IONO2 was produced by the 193 nm photolysis of NO2 in the presence of CF3I. After 800 μs, the IONO2 was photolysed by a 248 nm KrF excimer laser (Lambda Physik Compex 201, fluence = (1.0–6.4) × 1016 photon cm−2). The cavity ring-down system in Fig. 2 was used to detect the NO3 photofragment. High reflectivity mirrors were employed with a reflectance R > 0.9995 over the wavelength range 630–690 nm at 0° incidence (Layertec, Germany). The mirrors were protected from the reagents by separate curtain flows of N2 (Fig. 2). The cavity ring-down signal was captured by a photomultiplier tube (Electron Tubes 9816B) connected to a fast digital oscilloscope (Le Croy Waverunner), interfaced to a computer which determined the ring-down time.21 Fig. 2  A schematic diagram of the apparatus used to measure the NO3 photofragment resulting from the photodissociation at 248 nm of IONO2. IONO2 was made by excimer laser photolysis at 193 nm of a NO2/CF3I mixture. NO3 was observed using time-resolved cavity ringdown spectroscopy at 662 nm. The IO photofragment was detected by laser induced fluorescence (LIF). LIF spectra of the IO(A2Π3/2–X2Π3/2 (2,0)) band were recorded by scanning a pulsed dye laser (Continuum Surelight Nd:YAG & Sirah Cobra-Stretch dye laser with Coumarin 2 dye) over the wavelength range 444.6–445.6 nm. The non-resonant LIF signal at λ = 472 nm [IO(A2Π3/2–X2Π3/2, (2,2))] was detected by a fast photomultiplier tube (Electron Tubes model 9816B), mounted perpendicular to the cavity ring-down axis, in the vertical plane (not shown in Fig. 2). The fluorescence was detected through the combination of a 455 nm long pass filter and a 480 nm interference filter, which was tilted by ∼10° to shift the peak of its transmission to ∼475 nm.All the experiments were carried out at a relatively high pressure (70–100 Torr), in order to favour the pressure-dependent formation of IONO2 (viareaction (1)).MaterialsCF3I (99% pure, Fluorochem) and N2 (99.9999%, pure Air products) were used without further purification. NO2 (99.5% pure, Air Products) was purified to remove NO and HNO3 by trap-to-trap distillation from an ethanol/liquid N2 slush bath at 159 K. N2O5 was prepared from the reaction of NO2 and O3 and stored at 195 K.Results and discussionQuantum chemistry calculationsIn order to provide a theoretical background to the measurements of the absorption cross section and photolysis quantum yields, we carried out a set of ab initio quantum chemistry calculations on IONO2 using the Gaussian 03 set of programs.22 For the iodine atom we used a 6-311G basis set, supplemented with d, f, and diffuse s and p functions, that has been developed for G2 level calculations and tested extensively by comparing the calculated properties of a variety of small iodine-containing molecules against experimental data.23 For nitrogen and oxygen, the standard 6-311+g(2d,p) triple zeta basis set was used. The optimized geometry of the ground state (1A′) is shown in Fig. 3A. The excited states were calculated using single-excitation configuration interaction (CIS).24 The first excited state (1A″) is 3.54 eV vertically above the ground state, corresponding to a photon wavelength of 350 nm. The oscillator strength, f, is 3.6 × 10−3i.e. this is a relatively weak transition with a cross section expected to be less than 10−17 cm2 molecule−1. The optimised geometry of the first excited state is shown in Fig. 3B. This is actually a transition state with an imaginary frequency (66i cm−1) corresponding to the I–ONO2 stretch and, as shown in Fig. 3, the I–ONO2 bond is already significantly stretched compared with the ground state. The second excited state of IONO2 (1A′) is 3.78 eV vertically above the ground state, corresponding to a photon wavelength of 328 nm, with f = 2.7 × 10−3. In the optimised geometry of this state, the I–ONO2 bond is even more stretched (2.51 Å). The next transition with a significant oscillator strength occurs 7.44 eV above the ground state; this corresponds to a photon wavelength of 166 nm and will thus not contribute to the IONO2 spectroscopy discussed below. Thus, these calculations predict that IONO2 will absorb in the near UV through transitions of nearly equal strength to the two lowest-lying electronic states, and dissociate to I + NO3. Fig. 3  Quantum chemistry calculations of IONO2 at the HF/6-311+g(2d,p) level of theory: (A). Optimised geometry of the ground state (1A′); (B). Optimised geometry of the first excited state (1A′) using the CI-Singles method. Both structures are planar. In order to compare with the known absorption spectrum of BrONO2,13 we have performed an analogous set of calculations on this molecule using the 6-311+g(2d,p) basis set. The first excited state of BrONO2 is predicted to be 4.31 eV above its optimised ground state geometry, with f = 8 × 10−4 and the band origin at 287 nm. The second excited state is predicted to be 4.83 eV above the ground state geometry, with f = 9 × 10−4 and the band origin at 287 nm. The IONO2 absorption spectrum is thus predicted to be red-shifted by 0.8–1.1 eV with respect to that of BrONO2, and to have a larger cross section (by a factor ∼4) close to the onset of photolysis.Absolute absorption cross section of IONO2The IONO2 absorption spectrum was determined using a similar approach to that of Mössinger et al.16 IONO2 was generated by the pulsed photolysis of a NO2/CF3I mixture in the absorption cell shown in Fig. 1. The absorption spectrum recorded after the excimer laser pulse was divided by the spectrum recorded before the excimer laser was turned on, but with NO2 and CF3I flowing through the cell. The resulting raw spectrum then contains the IONO2 absorption spectrum, as well as inverse absorption spectra corresponding to the amounts of NO2 and CF3I consumed by photolysis of NO2 (reaction (4)) and the subsequent reactions 5 and 1. NO2 is also removed by the reactions: (6) (7) The IO that forms from reaction (5) not only produces IONO2 (reaction (1)), but also reacts with itself and NO (from photolysis of NO2): (8) (9) The IONO2 spectrum was thus obtained by fitting and removing the NO2 and CF3I components from each raw spectrum. Reference absorption spectra of NO2 and CF3I were first recorded separately in the absorption cell. These spectra and the raw spectra were then converted into optical density spectra. The optical density spectra for NO2 and CF3I were then fitted to the raw optical density spectra using a least-squares method employing singular value decomposition (SVD)25 to treat this over-determined system where the number of wavelength points (∼700) greatly exceeds the two variables (Δ[NO2] and Δ[CF3I]). An example of such a fit is shown in Fig. 4. The resulting residual spectrum is attributed to IONO2 absorption, with an onset at ∼350 nm that is in accord with the quantum theory calculations (see above). Fig. 4  Deconvolution of the raw optical density spectrum by fitting the reference optical density spectra of NO2 and CF3I. The residual is assigned to the IONO2 absorption spectrum. Experimental conditions: [NO2] = 7.9 × 1015 molecule cm−3; 6.7 × 1015 molecule cm−3; [N2] = 3.3 × 1018 molecule cm−3; 193 nm excimer laser fluence = 3.2 × 1016 photon cm−2. The absolute cross section is obtained by using a kinetic model of the chemistry in the absorption cell to determine the concentration of IONO2 that would have been produced for a given depletion in NO2. This model contains reactions (1)–(9), as well as additional reactions involving OIO and INO2.26 For the experiment shown in Fig. 4 with the conditions listed in the figure caption, the model predicts that 31% of the O(3P) formed from photolysis of NO2 at 193 nm produces IO (the remaining 69% is removed by reaction (6) with NO2); 72% of this IO then recombines with NO2 to form IONO2. At the measured laser fluence, 1.3% of the NO2 is photolysed, and a further 1.7% is removed by reactions (1), (6) and (7). Thus, 3.0% of the NO2 is removed in total, in good agreement with the fit in Fig. 4 which indicates a depletion of 3.1%. This quantity of NO2 (2.3 × 1014 cm−3) would have produced 2.3 × 1013 cm−3 of IONO2 (an efficiency of 10.0%), corresponding to σ(IONO2, 248 nm) = 6.7 × 10−18 cm2.There are two major contributions to the uncertainty of the model calculation. First is the uncertainty in the experimental input to the model: the 193 nm excimer laser fluence (±5% – see Experimental section), the concentrations of NO2 and CF3I (±6% from the measured absorbances before the laser photolysis is turned on), and the pressure in the reactor (±1%). The second contribution arises from the errors in the model rate coefficients, particularly for reactions (1) (±12%), 5 (±10%), 6 (±14%) and 8 (±20%), and the photolysis cross section of NO2 at 193 nm (±3%).13 When all these errors are taken into account in the model, the uncertainty in the calculated efficiency with which the NO2 removed is converted to IONO2 is estimated to be ±18%.Three IONO2 absorption spectra were recorded over a range of conditions (193 nm excimer fluence = (0.6–3.2) × 1016 photon cm−2; [NO2] = (0.8–1.8) × 1016 cm−3), so that the NO2 depletion ranged from 0.6 to 3.1%. The average of the three IONO2 spectra is plotted in Fig. 5. A fifth-order polynomial fit through the data yields:    Fig. 5  The absorption spectrum of IONO2: average of three experimental measurements (thin line); a polynomial fit through the average (thick black line); 2σ uncertainty (broken lines). The 2σ uncertainty, calculated from combining in quadrature the standard deviation of the average, and the deconvolution and model error, is also shown in Fig. 5. The uncertainty ranges from ±31% at 240 nm to ±89% at 370 nm. Note that some of the side-products which arise from this method for producing IONO2, such as CF2O and FNO (from reaction (7)) and INO2 (from I + NO2 + N2), also absorb in the near-UV. However, CF2O only absorbs below 245 nm; there is no evidence in the residual spectrum of the characteristic bands of FNO between 285 and 340 nm; and the ratio of INO2 to IONO2 predicted by the model is only ∼5%, so the INO2 absorption spectrum would have made an insignificant contribution, within the experimental uncertainty, to the retrieved IONO2 spectrum (as found previously16). INO2 and FNO were therefore not included in the spectral fitting procedure.Some additional measurements of the IONO2 absorption spectrum were made by photolysing the NO2/CF3I mixture in a small photolysis cell (cylinder of length 12 cm and internal diameter 2 cm, with quartz end windows), before flowing the gas into the large absorption cell shown in Fig. 1. The residual spectrum, measured in the large cell about 10 s after the photolysis laser, had the same general shape as that measured by direct photolysis in the large cell, ∼25 ms after the photolysis flash (Fig. 4). These measurements indicate that the residual spectrum is caused by the production of a single species which is relatively long-lived in the gas phase, as might be expected for IONO2 but not for a radical species.Fig. 6 compares the IONO2 absorption spectrum from the present study with that measured previously by Mössinger et al.16 The latter is significantly larger, by a factor of 1.7 at 240 nm increasing to 6.9 at 350 nm. Since both studies employed a similar technique, the reasons for this discrepancy are unclear. The absorption cross section of BrONO2 from the IUPAC evaluation13 is also shown. When this spectrum is red-shifted by 1.2 eV then there is very good overlap with the IONO2 spectrum measured in the present study (Fig. 6). This energy shift is in reasonable accord with the calculated differences of 0.8 and 1.1 eV in the vertical excitation energies of BrONO2 and IONO2 to their first and second excited states (see above), given the uncertainties in both the measured spectrum (Fig. 5) and the level of theory (±0.4 eV).24 In contrast, the BrONO2 spectrum would need to be red-shifted by ∼2.1 eV to overlap with the spectrum of Mössinger et al.16 Lastly, the ratio of the cross sections of IONO2 and BrONO2 at their predicted onset wavelengths (4.9 × 10−19 cm2 at 350 nm and 2.3 × 10−19 cm2 at 287 nm, respectively) is 2.1 ± 1.9. This ratio is in sensible accord with the ratio of their calculated oscillator strengths of these molecules, which is 4.5 (see above) (Table 1).

For comparison, the IUPAC-recommended BrONO2 spectrum is shown, together with the spectrum red-shifted by 1.20 eV. The solid black point shows the cross section for the yield of the NO3 photofragment measured in this study at 248 nm. Yield of IO from photolysis of IONO2 at 248 nmAn upper limit to the yield of IO from photolysis of IONO2 at 248 nm was measured by attempting to detect IO from a LIF scan of the IO(A2Π3/2–X2Π3/2 (2,0)) band between 444.6–445.6 nm. IONO2 was again produced from the 193 nm laser photolysis of an NO2/CF3I mixture. Under our experimental conditions the IO concentration reached a maximum ∼20 μs after the 193 nm pulse, and then decayed mostly through recombination with NO2 to form IONO2. Fig. 7 shows a LIF scan over the IO(A2Π3/2–X2Π3/2 (2,0)) band, taken 20 μs after the 193 nm pulse. A suitable interval after the conversion of IO to IONO2 is essentially complete (700 μs after the 193 nm pulse), the 248 nm photolysis laser was triggered to photolyse the IONO2. At the measured 248 nm fluence of 6.1 × 1016 photon cm−2, the fraction of IONO2 photolysed would have been 48%. Fig. 7 shows that when the IO(A2Π3/2–X2Π3/2 (2,0)) band was scanned 2 μs after the 248 nm laser pulse, IO was not detectable: an SVD fit shows that this spectrum contains less than 0.7% of the IO signal that was measured 20 μs after the 193 nm pulse. The kinetic model of the reactor chemistry indicates that 71% of the IO observed by LIF 20 μs after the 193 nm pulse should have been converted to IONO2. From this we estimate an upper limit to the yield of IO from photolysis of IONO2 at 248 nm of ϕ(IO) ≤ 2% (2σ uncertainty). Fig. 7  LIF spectrum of IO collected by scanning the IO(A2Π3/2–X2Π3/2 (2,0)) band 20 μs after the 193 nm excimer laser pulse, when the IO concentration reached a maximum (solid grey line). When the LIF spectrum was scanned again 2 μs after the 248 nm excimer pulse (solid black line), IO is not apparent (≤0.7% of the maximum). Yield of NO3 from photolysis of IONO2 at 248 nmThe yield of NO3 produced by the photolysis of IONO2 at 248 nm was measured by CRDS in the 660–665 nm region. High resolution reference spectra for NO2 and NO3 were required for SVD analysis of the absorbance spectra, and these were first obtained at a spectral at a resolution ∼0.2 cm−1 using the CRD apparatus. The NO2 cross-section was determined directly from absorbance spectra obtained by flowing a 2.5% NO2/N2 mixture at 100 Torr pressure into the absorption cell illustrated in Fig. 2. The resulting absolute cross section compares well with the low resolution spectrum recently reported by Voigt et al.,27 as shown in Fig. 8. Fig. 8  Upper panel: NO2 absorption cross-section at 296 K. High resolution cross section obtained by cavity ring-down spectroscopy in this study (solid grey line); low resolution cross section from Voigt et al.27 (solid black line). Lower panel: NO3 absorption cross-section. High resolution cross section measured by cavity ring-down spectroscopy in this study (solid grey line), scaled to fit the low resolution cross section from Yokelson et al.37 The NO3 cross section was obtained by flowing N2O5 entrained in N2 into the CRD cell, and then photolysing it at 193 nm to yield NO3 + NO2. As equal concentrations of NO2 and NO3 are produced by photolysis of N2O5, the contribution of NO2 to the NO3 cross-section can be effectively ignored since it is ∼4000 times smaller. The resulting high-resolution cross-section was then scaled to the well-established absolute cross-section at 662 nm (Fig. 8).IONO2 was then produced as before by the 193 nm photolysis of an NO2/CF3I mixture, and photolysed at 248 nm after an interval of 700 μs. Fig. 9 shows the time-resolved change in the absorption at 662 nm, which is converted into the equivalent NO3 concentration (note that the 193 and 248 nm lasers were triggered at 100 and 800 μs, respectively). The presence of NO3 was confirmed by spectral scans at several points along the time trace. The NO3 contained in these scans was determined by SVD fitting of the reference spectra of NO3, NO2 and I2, as exemplified in Fig. 10. An SVD fit to remove the NO2 absorbance was required because the ratio of NO3 to NO2 was ≤3 × 10−4, so that the absorption spectra in the 660–665 nm region were always dominated by NO2. The NO3 concentrations derived from SVD fits are plotted as discrete points in Fig. 9. Fig. 9 shows that although most of the changes in the 662 nm absorbance after the 193 and 248 nm lasers are due to changes in [NO3], the absorption after ∼900 μs is not entirely due to NO3, which completely disappears by 1500 μs. The remaining absorption is due to I2,28 which formed from the recombination of I atoms produced by the photolysis of CF3I at 248 nm. The estimated initial I atom concentration after the 248 nm laser ranged from (3.8–23.4) × 1013 cm−3, depending on the laser fluence. Possible mechanisms for this rapid formation of I2 have been discussed by Joseph et al.26 Fig. 9  Time-resolved variation of the absorption signal at 662 nm (shown as equivalent NO3 concentration), measured by CRDS (grey line). IONO2 was prepared by 193 nm photolysis of an NO2/CF3I mixture at 100 μs, and then photolysed at 800 μs using a 248 nm laser. The solid black points with error bars show measurements of [NO3] made by a spectral scan between 660 and 665 nm. The NO3 and NO2 components were extracted by an SVD analysis.  Fig. 10  An illustration of the SVD fitting process of reference spectra of NO2, I2 and NO3 to an absorption spectrum between 661 and 663 nm recorded by cavity ring-down spectroscopy. The top panel shows the absorbance spectrum (solid grey line), dominated by the NO2 component, along with SVD fit (solid black line). The second panel shows the scaled reference spectra for NO2 (solid line) and I2 (broken line), the third panel shows the scaled reference spectrum for NO3, while the fourth panel shows the fitting residuals. [NO2] = (5.50 ± 0.09) × 1015 molecule cm−3; [I2] = (5.91 ± 0.61) × 1013 molecule cm−3, and [NO3] = (3.05 ± 0.46) × 1011 molecule cm−3, where the stated errors are 2σ. Fig. 9 shows that there is both prompt appearance of NO3 when the 248 nm laser triggers at 800 μs, and a further increase in NO3 over the next 100 μs. The prompt formation of NO3 is attributed to photolysis of IONO2via channel 2b. The subsequent growth is likely to be caused by various radicals, X, created by the 248 nm pulse, which react with IONO2:  (10)Possible candidates for X include CF3 and I, produced by photolysis of CF3I. Under our typical experimental conditions, the concentrations of these radicals immediately after the 248 nm pulse were 1.5 × 1014 molecule cm−3. The rate coefficient for reaction (10), k10, is constrained both by the observed rate of growth of NO3 after the 248 nm pulse, and the removal of NO3 by reaction with atomic iodine, which occurs at the collision frequency.29 A simulation of the time-dependent behaviour of NO3 after 800 μs shows that k10
					≥ 1 × 10−10 cm3 molecule−1 s−1. In the case of BrONO2 photolysis at 248 nm, similar behaviour was observed: prompt appearance of NO3, followed by an approximate doubling in NO3 over ∼200 μs.30 This slow growth was attributed to Br atoms, mostly produced by photolysis of BrONO2, reacting with the remaining BrONO2 to yield NO3. In the case of X = I, reaction (10) is close to being thermoneutral, and the reverse reaction has a measured rate coefficient of 1.5 × 10−12 cm3 molecule−1 s−1 at 295 K,29 so this reaction is perhaps a less likely candidate than with X = CF3.Fig. 9 shows that NO3 is also produced promptly by the 193 nm laser. The source of this NO3 is photolysis of the background level of IONO2 which built up from previous 193 nm laser pulses as the gas mixture flowed through the reactor. Under typical operating conditions, the mixture was exposed to ∼10 pulses, since the residence time was 2 s and the laser repetition rate was 5 Hz. When the residence time was reduced to 1 s (by doubling the flow through the reactor but keeping the pressure constant at 97 Torr), the NO3 produced by the 193 nm was approximately halved, providing clear evidence that the NO3 was indeed produced from a build up of IONO2.The IONO2 produced by each 193 nm laser pulse, and which survived the 248 nm pulse 700 μs later (∼50%, including subsequent removal by reaction (10)), would then have been diluted (by a factor of 0.03) by radial diffusion in the reactor before the next 193/248 nm pair of pulses, leading to the small build up of background IONO2 during the residence time of the gas flow in the reactor. Modelling this build up of background IONO2 as the gas mixture flowed through the reactor indicates that the background level would have been ≤15% of the IONO2 created within each 193 nm laser pulse volume, the upper limit arising because we have not included possible removal of background IONO2 on the reactor walls. Assuming that the IONO2 absorption cross section increases further into the UV (by analogy with BrONO2
					–
					Fig. 7), then σ(IONO2) at 193 nm is ∼4 × 10−17 cm2 molecule−1 and ∼80% of the background IONO2 within the laser beam region would be photolysed by the 193 nm pulse. That is, the background IONO2 would have contributed less than 3% of the IONO2 produced directly by the 193 nm pulse and then photolysed 700 μs later by the 248 nm laser.The yield of NO3, ϕ(NO3), was then determined from the measured production of NO3 at a 5 μs delay after the 248 nm laser. The delay allowed for quenching of vibrationally excited NO3,30 but not for any significant additional production of NO3 from reaction (10). The NO3 produced was then divided by the concentration of IONO3 photolysed, which was estimated from the laser fluence, σ(IONO2) at 248 nm, and the concentration of IONO2 produced by the 193 nm laser in the cell after 700 μs (calculated using the kinetic model). ϕ(NO3) was measured over a range of 248 nm laser fluences from 1.0 to 6.3 × 1016 photon cm−2, and is independent of the laser fluence, as shown in Fig. 11. The lack of any systematic dependence of ϕ(NO3) on laser fluence is evidence that the presence of residual IONO2, and secondary chemistry resulting from the photolysis of CF3I at 248 nm, which could both have played a role in this system because of the comparatively long gas residence time (corresponding to ∼10 ArF/KrF excimer laser pulses), were in fact not important. The average yield is ϕ(NO3) = 0.21 ± 0.09, where the 2σ uncertainty includes in quadrature the standard deviation of the average yield (Fig. 11) and the uncertainty in σ(IONO2) at 248 nm. Fig. 11  The quantum yield of NO3 from the photolysis of IONO2 at 248 nm, as a function of excimer laser fluence. The error bars are the SVD fitting uncertainties combined in quadrature with the uncertainty in σ(IONO2) at 248 nm. The solid line is the mean value for the quantum yield, with 1 standard deviation indicated by the broken lines. Thus, I + NO3 is the major photolysis channel of IONO2 at 248 nm, in accord with the quantum calculations described above. However, the observable yield of NO3 is well below the expected lower limit of 98% (since ϕ(IO) ≤ 2%), indicating that ∼80% of the NO3 is produced with substantial internal energy, and subsequently dissociates. While it is energetically possible that there is concerted photolysis to yield I + NO2 + O, the quantum theory calculations on the first and second excited state suggest a simple cleavage of the I–NO3 bond (Fig. 3). The hot NO3 most likely dissociates to NO2 and O; indeed, O atoms have been observed following the analogous photodissociation of ClONO2 at 248 nm.31 This is not surprising as the NO3 produced by channel 2b at 248 nm could have up to 352 kJ mol−1 of internal energy available to the photofragments, whereas only 209 kJ mol−1 is required to break the NO2–O bond. Analogous production of hot NO3 is seen in the 248 nm photochemistry of BrONO2, where ϕ(NO3) = 0.28 ± 0.09,30 and ClONO2, where ϕ(NO3) = 0.6 nm.31,32 Thus, there is some indication that less hot NO3 is produced moving up the group from iodine to chlorine, in accord with less internal excitation being available to the photofragments because of the increasing halogen atom–NO3 bond energy.Atmospheric implicationsThe photodissociation frequency of IONO2 for summer at midday, 40° latitude, is computed to be J(IONO2) = (3.0 ± 2.1) × 10−3 s−1, using the solar irradiance calculated with a 2-stream radiation code33 and the SOLAR 2000 top-of-the-atmosphere actinic flux.34 This J(IONO2) value is about an order of magnitude lower than the frequency of 0.04 s−1 calculated previously for similar conditions, because of the significant absorption tail at wavelengths above 370 nm in the spectrum of Mössinger et al.16 (Fig. 6). The thermal dissociation of IONO2 is another pathway for its atmospheric removal.14 However, using the new bond energy D0(IO–NO2) = 117 kJ mol−1, the thermal lifetime of IONO2 is estimated14 to be ∼1.5 days at 290 K and 760 Torr, compared with a photolytic lifetime of ∼300 s from the present results.IONO2 can also be removed by uptake on moist sea-salt aerosol, with an uptake coefficient of ∼0.01.35 In order to compete with photolysis, the volumetric aerosol surface area (ASA) would need to be ∼6 × 10−5 cm2 cm−3. This ASA is approximately 100 times larger than the typical ASA of the background marine boundary layer.10 Hence, uptake of IONO2 on aerosol is only likely to compete with photolysis in semi-polluted marine environments, but will of course be the major removal pathway during night-time.Although the photodissociation of IONO2 to I + NO3 appears to complete an O3-depleting cycle (see Introduction section), O3 will actually be depleted inefficiently. This is because the production of hot NO3, which then dissociates to O + NO2, effects a null O3-depleting cycle: the resulting O will recombine with O2 to form O3, balancing the O3 consumed by the iodine atom photofragment (reaction (3)). Even if the fraction of hot NO3 from IONO2 photolysis decreases at longer wavelengths (as in the case of BrONO230), NO3 itself photolyses to NO2 + O with 90% yield, and only 10% to NO + O2.36 It is only this final 10% which is O3-depleting because the NO will then react with O3 to form NO2, in addition to the O3 removed by the iodine atom photofragment.ConclusionsThe absorption cross section of IONO2 between 240 and 370 nm has been determined to be significantly smaller than a previous determination.16 Although the resulting photolysis frequency is significantly smaller, photolysis is still likely to be the major daytime removal process of IONO2, and will therefore limit the effectiveness of IONO2 as a daytime sink for IO. On the other hand, because O3 is consumed in producing IONO2 from atomic iodine, and the major photolysis channel either directly or indirectly produces atomic O and hence O3, the formation of IONO2 should have very little impact on O3 in the marine environment.AcknowledgementsThis work was supported by the Natural Environment Research Council’s Core Strategic Measurements in Atmospheric Science programme, and by the European Union THALOZ project.ReferencesB.

 	Fig. 1  Schematic diagram of the apparatus used to measure the absorption cross section of IONO2. The molecule was produced in the cell with quartz end windows by excimer laser photolysis of a NO2/CF3I mixture. The time-resolved UV-visible absorption spectrum was measured by a Bruker IFS 66 Fourier transform spectrometer with a deuterium lamp as the spectroscopic light source. M1 and M2 are dichroic mirrors reflecting at 193 nm. M3 is a parabolic mirror which focused the light from the deuterium lamp into the spectrometer.
