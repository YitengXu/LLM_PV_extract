    , Accepted 15th October 2021First published on 15th October 2021AbstractNew nanoparticles (Y6 NPs) based on the A–DA′D–A fused-ring conjugated small molecule Y6 have been prepared for the combined photothermal and photodynamic therapy of cancer. Y6 NPs show excellent light absorption from 300 to 900 nm, a good photothermal conversion efficiency of 57% and reactive oxygen species generation capability. The high photothermal conversion ability and superior photodynamic activity of Y6 NPs endow them with great potential for cancer therapy.
Cancer is one of the most severe diseases challenging human health.1 The exploration of new effective therapy methods has always been a hot topic.2–11 In this field, photothermal therapy (PTT) and photodynamic therapy (PDT), featuring non-invasiveness and high-efficiency, have been drawing more and more attention.12–15 PTT, as the name suggests, kills tumor cells via hyperthermia, while PDT induces the apoptosis of tumor cells by producing highly reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as singlet oxygen (1O2). Despite the obvious advantages of the two kinds of phototherapy, the drawbacks of the single treatment are becoming increasingly apparent. The high temperature produced during PTT may result in the death of the normal cells and the hypoxic microenvironment of the tumor cells restricts the 1O2 generation.13,16 Therefore, in order to obtain ideal therapeutic outcomes, PDT and PTT combination therapy is undoubtedly the desired choice for achieving more safety and reliability.17–19
Photosensitizers (PS) have played a key role in PTT and PDT.14,20–23 Through absorbing light energy, PS with photothermal conversion capability can enhance the local temperature of tumor cells to achieve PTT or can make O2 become 1O2 to complete PDT. Therefore, the performance of PS has a significant influence on the combination therapy efficacy, which at least should meet the following requirements. Under single laser irradiation, photosensitizers with hypotoxicity and good biocompatibility need to exhibit high photothermal conversion efficiencies (PTCE) and excellent ROS quantum yields. In addition, photosensitizers should exhibit wide near-infrared (NIR) absorption to kill the tumor cells in the deeper tissue because of the larger penetration depths of the NIR light.12,24 Among various photosensitizers, organic small molecule photosensitizers have shown huge potential for PTT and PDT because of their excellent biocompatibility and easy-to-tailor chemical structures.20 However, most of the developed organic PS such as organic dyes and porphyrin derivatives usually could not exhibit both PTT and PDT activities under single laser irradiation, and their limited light absorption abilities also constrain their wide application in tumor therapy.12 Recently various organic semiconductor materials have been applied in PTT and PDT.14,25 Among them, A–D–A fused-ring conjugated semiconductor materials represented by ITIC26 have begun to show their excellent performance in tumor therapy since 2019.27–31 This kind of small molecule photosensitizers consists of electron-donating units (D) and electron-withdrawing units (A), in which the push–pull electron effect between A and D will widen and enhance the light absorption to complete deep tumor therapy.32,33 Similar to ITIC, the emerging A–DA′D–A fused-ring conjugated small molecules represented by Y6 (Fig. 1) have also received our attention. Compared with A–D–A small molecules, another inserted A′ will further promote the intramolecular charge transfer for the enhancement of light absorption.34,35 A large number of aliphatic side chains in Y6 that rotate easily will boost the photothermal conversion ability due to the nonradiative decay.36,37 On the other hand, the A–DA′D–A small molecules have smaller singlet–triplet energy gaps (ΔEST = 0.42 eV) which will enhance the intersystem crossing (ISC) from the lowest singlet state (S1) to the triplet state (T1) based on the perturbation theory.38,39 The high rate constant of ISC is beneficial for the generation of ROS (Fig. 1). There is a reason to believe that A–DA′D–A small molecule photosensitizers will exhibit better PTT and PDT activities. However, so far, the study and application of A–DA′D–A small molecule photosensitizers in cancer treatment are still blank.

Herein, we firstly used the A–DA′D–A small molecule Y6 as the photosensitizer to achieve the combined photothermal and photodynamic therapy of tumors. The nanoparticles (Y6 NPs) based on Y6 prepared by the encapsulation of the amphiphilic polymer DSPE-PEG2000 showed strong light absorption in the 300–950 nm region. Under laser irradiation (808 nm, 1.0 W cm−2), Y6 NPs with good photostability displayed a high PTCE (57%) and 1O2 generation ability, which make them have excellent anti-cancer efficacy (Fig. 2).
 Fig. 2  The application of Y6 NPs in combined photothermal and photodynamic therapy. 
Y6 was synthesized using a previously reported method (Scheme S1, ESI†).34 In order to improve the solubility of the photosensitizers, we used DSPE-PEG2000 to encapsulate Y6 to prepare the nanoparticles Y6 NPs. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) measurement showed that Y6 NPs display spherical morphology when dispersed well in water (Fig. 3). Dynamic light scattering experiments indicated that these spheres possess uniform sizes with an average diameter of 162.8 nm.

Then, we studied the light absorption capability of Y6 NPs. As shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†), Y6 NPs exhibited strong absorption from 300 to 950 nm. In contrast to the absorption of Y6 in CHCl3, the aqueous solution of Y6 NPs showed a red-shift in the absorption of about 200 nm due to molecular aggregation. The strong and wide absorption of Y6 NPs would contribute to their application in NIR-triggered PTT and PDT.
Given the strong absorption of Y6 NPs at 808 nm, we explored their photothermal conversion and 1O2 generation capabilities under laser irradiation (808 nm, 1.0 W cm−2). Fig. 4a shows the temperature changes of Y6 NP aqueous solution with different concentrations under laser irradiation. The temperature of the Y6 NP aqueous solution at the maximum concentration increased by about 35 °C after 12.5 min of laser irradiation (808 nm, 1.0 W cm−2). When we removed the laser irradiation source, a decrease in temperature was observed (Fig. S5a, ESI†). According to a previously reported method,37 the PTCE of Y6 NPs was calculated to be 57% under laser irradiation (808 nm, 1.0 W cm−2), which exceeds those of various developed small molecule photosensitizers.12
 Fig. 4  (a) Temperature change curves of different Y6 NP concentrations (determined by Y6 concentrations) in water under laser irradiation (808 nm, 1.0 W cm−2); (b) temperature change curves of Y6 NP aqueous solution (25 μM) under laser irradiation of different laser power densities; (c) photostability test of Y6 NPs (25 μM) under laser irradiation (808 nm, 1.0 W cm−2); (d) the absorption change curves of DPBF in Y6 NP aqueous solution (25 μM) at 415 nm under laser irradiation of different laser power densities. 
Besides concentration, the temperature changes also depended on the laser power density. As shown in Fig. 3b, with the increase of the laser power density, the rate of temperature enhancement significantly increased. Under laser irradiation (1.5 W cm−2), the temperature of the Y6 NP aqueous solution was increased by 47 °C (Fig. 4b), which is enough to induce the apoptosis of tumor cells. In addition, Y6 NPs exhibited superior photostability. During the 7 cycles of laser irradiation for 12 min and cooling down to the initial temperature, the heating rate of the Y6 NPs under laser irradiation remained constant (Fig. 4c).
Then, we explored the photodynamic activity of Y6 NPs. We measured the absorption changes at 415 nm of 1,3-diphenylisobenzofuran (DPBF) in the Y6 NP aqueous solution to estimate the 1O2 generation ability of Y6 NPs because DPBF can react with 1O2. It can be seen from Fig. 4d that the absorption of DPBF reduced continuously during 6 min of laser irradiation, indicating the generation of 1O2. Using indocyanine green (ICG) as the reference, the 1O2 quantum yield of Y6 NPs is 9 times that of ICG under the same conditions (Fig. S6, ESI†). The singlet oxygen quantum yield of ICG is 0.2%.30 Therefore, Y6 NPs showed a singlet oxygen quantum yield of about 1.8%.
Furthermore, the ROS generation of Y6 NPs in human cervical cancer cells (HeLa cells) was investigated using 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) as the fluorescent probe. Under the action of ester hydrolase in cells and ROS, DCFH-DA without fluorescence can be converted to DCF (2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein) with green fluorescence. After 7 min of laser irradiation, it is obvious that green fluorescence appeared in HeLa cells after being incubated with Y6 NPs and DCFH-DA, suggesting the presence of ROS (Fig. 5). From the control experiment results, it can be concluded that only Y6 NPs can generate ROS after laser irradiation.

The toxicity of Y6 NPs to HeLa cells was then evaluated. After being incubated with Y6 NPs, HeLa cells exhibited more than 83% viability even at the highest concentration in the dark (Fig. 6), which indicates the outstanding biosafety of Y6 NPs. On the contrary, the viability of HeLa cells incubated with Y6 NPs decreased dramatically after laser irradiation (808 nm, 0.5 W cm−2) for 7 min. As shown in Fig. 6, with the increase of the Y6 NPs concentration, the amount of cell apoptosis increased. Only about 20% cell viability was found in HeLa cells after being incubated with Y6 NPs (20 μM). The half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) was calculated to be ∼ 5 μM. These results revealed that Y6 NPs have good biocompatibility and anti-tumor activity.

The photoablation effects of Y6 NPs against HeLa cells were further studied through cell staining using calcein AM as the live cell staining dye and propidium iodide as the dead cell staining dye (Fig. 7). It was found that there was no death of HeLa cells in the absence of laser irradiation or Y6 NPs. In contrast, almost all the cells treated with Y6 NPs were dead after laser irradiation, which once again proved Y6 NPs with superior capability for eradicating tumor cells.

In summary, Y6 NPs based on the A–DA′D–A fused-ring conjugated small molecule Y6 have been applied for the first time in cancer therapy. As a new kind of photosensitizer, Y6 displays wide and strong NIR absorption, which is beneficial for deep tumor therapy. Flexible side chains and high intramolecular charge transfer in Y6 can accelerate the fluorescence quenching to obtain a high PTCE. The small ΔEST of Y6 could be beneficial to the enhancement of the PDT activity. As a result, Y6 NPs with excellent photostability and hypotoxicity exhibit high PTT and PDT activities, which are expected to become biocompatible nanodrug candidates for combined photothermal and photodynamic therapy of cancers. Moreover, these preliminary results will provide strong support for further exploration of the application of the A–DA′D–A fused-ring conjugated small molecules in tumor therapy.
