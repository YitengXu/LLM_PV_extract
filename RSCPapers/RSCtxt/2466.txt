    , Accepted 18th February 2020First published on 18th February 2020AbstractInterfacial engineering of electrode modification has proved to be an effective approach for improving the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic solar cells (OSCs). However, compared to the advances in active layers, the study of interfacial modification is seriously lagging and the contribution of electrode modification to PCE enhancement is marginalized. Herein, we synthesized a series of polynuclear metal-oxo clusters (PMCs) with gradually varied chemical compositions and photoelectronic properties, by which an efficient and stable hole extraction layer was developed to enhance OSC efficiency. The PCE of the OSC modified by PMC-4 was improved from 15.7% to 16.3% as compared to the PEDOT:PSS device. Moreover, PMC-4 can be fabricated through solution processing without any post-treatment and the corresponding device shows improved long-term stability. As revealed for the first time, the strong oxidizing property of PMC can induce formation of an inorganic–organic electron transfer complex with a barrier-free interface for efficient hole extraction. Furthermore, experimental data and theoretical calculation results reveal that the molecular polarization of mixed-addenda PMCs can enhance the capacitance at the AIL/active layer interfaces. As a result, the mixed-addenda PMCs can be processed via blade-coating to make a large-area OSC of 1 cm2 and a certified PCE of 14.3% was achieved.
Introduction
Benefitting from the rapid advances in photoactive layer materials, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of OSCs has exceeded 16%, reaching the threshold for practical applications.1–4 Besides the active layer, an electrode interlayer is also crucial for achieving high efficiencies.5–7 The electrode interlayer helps to form a favorable built-in electric field and barrier-free contact at the interface between the electrode and active layer, and thus, charge carriers can drift and ultimately be collected by the corresponding electrodes.8–10 However, compared to the active layer, development of the electrode interlayer is largely lagging.11 In particular, electrode interlayer materials for anode modification are extremely scarce, which severely limits the further enhancement of OSC efficiencies.
From the aspect of practical use, ideal interlayer materials should possess the following characteristics: (1) superior capacity for charge extraction to realize the maximum efficiency of OSCs; (2) compatibility with large-area printing techniques in industrial manufacturing; and (3) good chemical stability and low cost. At present, most top PCE values in OSCs are obtained by utilizing PEDOT:PSS as the anode interlayer (AIL).12,13 However, the corrosive and hygroscopic properties of PEDOT:PSS may degrade the long-term stability of OSCs, making it unsuitable for commercialization.14 To break the monopoly of PEDOT:PSS in anode modification, great efforts have been devoted to developing solution-processed AILs, such as self-doped conjugated polymers15,16 and metal oxides,17 but these AILs caused serious Voc loss when modifying the latest active layers because of the interfacial barrier for hole extraction.18 Recently, Lin et al. reported the use of liquid-exfoliated 2D semiconductor WS2 as an AIL to achieve a PCE of 16.5% in ternary OSCs. However, the 2D WS2 nanosheet is difficult to prepare, limiting its application in large-scale production.19 Therefore, it is still a great challenge to develop new solution-processed AILs with ideal properties for fabricating highly efficient OSCs.
Polynuclear metal-oxo clusters (PMC), a kind of inorganic molecule-based nanocluster, have various applications in catalysis, medicine and organic optoelectronics with their advantages of structural diversity and tunable electronic properties.20 Unlike common inorganic metal oxides, the definite chemical structure of inorganic molecule-based nanoclusters can not only ensure the reproducibility of device performance, but also provide an opportunity to investigate the “molecular structure–photoelectronic property–device performance” relationship by setting up a theoretical model. Moreover, inorganic molecule-based nanoclusters can be easily synthesized from fundamental inorganic materials, so the cost is very low. However, only a few commercial PMCs have been reported for use as electrode interlayers in OSCs21,22 and the OSCs modified by commercial PMCs exhibited low PCEs of only about 10%.23,24 In particular, the effects of PMC chemical composition on photoelectronic properties as well as on device performances have not yet been systematically investigated and the ability of PMCs to meet the requirements of ideal AILs for practical use was still unknown.25,26 Therefore, optimizing PMC properties through tuning chemical composition might find a path to develop a more efficient and stable hole extraction layer, which is significant to the practical production of OSCs.
Herein, we report the effective approach of changing the Mo/W ratio to optimize the properties of inorganic molecule-based nanoclusters and develop a new PMC-based AIL that can potentially combine the all-important attributes of an ideal AIL for OSC applications. Benefitting from the optimized photoelectronic properties, the as-synthesized PMC-4 exhibits remarkable superiority to PEDOT:PSS and commercial PMCs in improving OSC efficiency and long-term stability. Unlike PEDOT:PSS, the PMC AILs can be easily processed without any post-treatment. The device with PMC-4 exhibited an outstanding PCE of 16.3% with excellent reproducibility, which is among the top PCE values of OSCs. By using ESR and UPS measurements, it is revealed for the first time that the PMCs can form an inorganic–organic electron transfer complex with a barrier-free interface for efficient hole extraction. Experimental data and density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that the molecular polarization of the mixed-addenda PMCs can enhance the capacitance at the PMC/active layer interfaces, decreasing the charge recombination of the devices. As a result, the mixed-addenda PMCs exhibited excellent thickness insensitivity in modifying OSCs. PMC-4 was processed by the blade-coating method to fabricate large-area OSCs of 1 cm2 and a certified PCE of 14.3% was achieved.
Results and discussion
PMC structures and photophysics

Fig. 1a presents the chemical structures of the PMCs used in this study. The five PMCs possess an identical Keggin structure, while the ratio of addenda atoms Mo/W gradually increased from 0/12 to 12/0. Among these, PMC-1 and PMC-5 are commercially available, while the others are prepared according to reported synthesis procedures.27 All the PMCs have good solubility in water and methanol but are insoluble in nonpolar solvents such as chloroform, chlorobenzene and toluene. Furthermore, we analyze the cost of the as-synthesized PMCs (PMC-2, PMC-3 and PMC-4) in the OSC fabrication. The mixed-addenda PMCs can be easily synthesized from ordinary inorganic materials, so the synthetic cost is very low. In practice, the amount of tungsten/molybdenum used in OSC fabrication is rather small. If the 10 nm thickness of PMCs is used, only about 10 μg of Mo or 20 μg of W element is needed to fabricate a 1 m2 OSC device. Thus, the overall cost of PMC AILs is sufficiently low for the mass production of OSCs. The structural characteristics of these five PMCs were well identified using powder X-ray diffraction and infrared spectroscopy (Fig. S1†). The chemical compositions of PMCs were analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS). As shown in Fig. 1b, the two peaks of Mo 3d5/2 at 236.4 eV and Mo 3d3/2 at 233.2 eV are typically ascribed to the Mo6+ doublet, while the peaks of W 4f7/2 at 38.2 eV and W 4f5/2 at 35.9 eV are indicative of the W6+ doublet. By calculating the peak area, it can be determined that the Mo/W stoichiometric ratios of the five PMCs correspond well with their chemical formulas. The absorption spectra of the PMCs are shown in Fig. 1c. The bands at 275–446 nm are assigned to the charge-transfer transition of the bridge oxygen to metal atoms (Ob/Oc → M) in the PMCs. The strong absorption bands in the short-wavelength range of 200–232 nm for the PMCs should be regarded as the charge-transfer transition of the terminal oxygen to metal atoms (Ot → M).28

Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) was performed to investigate the energy level structures of the PMCs. The ionization potentials are found in the range of 8.03–8.18 eV for the PMCs, giving the position of the valence band with respect to vacuum level. In combination with the optical band gaps, the levels of conduction bands are estimated to be −5.35, −5.40, −5.41, −5.42 and −5.50 eV for PMC-1, PMC-2, PMC-3, PMC-4 and PMC-5, respectively. Moreover, the WF of bare ITO was calculated to be 4.19 eV (see Fig. S3†) and was elevated to approximately 5.35–5.50 eV by covering the PMCs. It is worth noting that the WFs of PMCs are higher than that of PEDOT:PSS, so they are energetically superior to PEDOT:PSS in forming barrier-free contact with active layers. Since the WF of PMCs is deeper than the HOMO levels of most reported polymer donors, Fermi-level pinning of the anode to the positive integer charge-transfer state (EICT+) of polymer donors may occur according to the integer charge transfer (ICT) theory; this is essential for the formation of barrier-free contact at the anode/active layer interface.29 The energy diagram for each PMC is provided in Fig. 1d. The levels of conduction bands are gradually downshifted from PMC-1 to PMC-5, suggesting a growing oxidation capability of PMCs with increasing Mo component.
Since electrical conductivity is a key parameter that impacts the hole transport property of AILs, we measured the longitudinal and lateral conductivities of PMC films. The longitudinal conductivities (σ⊥) of PMC films were estimated by measuring the current–voltage (I–V) curve of devices with the structure of ITO/PMC/Al.30 From PMC-1 to PMC-5, the σ⊥ values were determined to be 1.02 × 10−5, 2.39 × 10−5, 2.13 × 10−5, 2.83 × 10−5 and 1.31 × 10−5 S cm−1, respectively (Fig. 1e), which are comparable to that of PEDOT:PSS (σ⊥ = 2.62 × 10−5 S cm−1, see Fig. S4†). The lateral conductivities (σ‖) of the PMC films were measured using the four-point probe method. The lateral conductivities are lower than the longitudinal conductivities by approximately three to four orders of magnitude. Since the charge carriers transport vertically through the OSC device, the low lateral conductivity can promote holes moving towards the anode and reduce charge recombination at the interface.
The surface morphologies of PMC films were investigated by tapping-mode atomic force microscopy (AFM). Fig. 1f and g present the AFM images of ITO substrate covered with PMC-4. The ITO surface becomes smoother when modified with the PMC-4 film, showing a root-mean-square roughness (Rq) reduced from 3.92 to 2.71 nm. The modification of the ITO substrate by other PMC films also leads to reduced Rq values in the range of 2.71–3.39 nm (Fig. S5†). These results indicate that the PMC films can passivate the surface defects of ITO, which is favorable for decreasing the leakage current of the devices. Since chloroform is the solvent for processing the active layer, we employed chloroform to investigate the wettability of the PMC-covered ITO electrode. As shown in Fig. S6,† the chloroform drops rapidly spread on the PMC surfaces with contact angles of 8.0–9.6°, suggesting that the active layer solution can be readily deposited on the AILs.
Device characterizations
The performances of the PMCs as AILs were investigated by fabricating OSC devices with the structure of ITO/PMC/PBDB-T-2F:Y6/PFN-Br/Al (Fig. 2a).31 As shown in Fig. 2b, c and Table 1, the device modified by PMC-4 showed the best performance with a PCE of 16.3%, which is among the top PCE values of OSCs. It is worth noting that both the best PCE and the averaged PCE of PMC-4 devices are higher than in the PEDOT:PSS device, indicating the superiority of PMC-4 in achieving high efficiencies. Moreover, although the HOMO level of PBDB-T-2F is as deep as −5.31 eV, the Voc values of the PMC-4 device can still reach the maximum Voc of the PEDOT:PSS device. The problem of Voc loss was not observed in the PMC-4 device, implying that the PMC-4 AIL does not cause an additional charge extraction barrier compared to PEDOT:PSS. Moreover, the PMC AILs could be readily fabricated without any post-treatment; this can simplify the fabrication procedure. As shown in the inset of Fig. 2b, the PCEs of 50 independent PMC-4-based cells based on PMC-4 exhibited outstanding reproducibility of device performance. Furthermore, PMC-4 was employed to modify other efficient active layers, including PBDB-T:ITIC,32 PBDB-T-2F:IT-4F,33 J52-2F:IT-M18 and PTB7-Th:PC71BM.34 All the devices exhibited PCEs comparable to their highest values in related reports, indicating that PMC-4 is a universal AIL for various active layers (Fig. S7 and Table S2†). The PCEs of the devices with PMC-2 and PMC-3 were slightly lower than that of the PMC-4 device, while the devices modified by the commercial PMC-1 and PMC-5 showed the lowest efficiencies. These results indicate that the mixed-addenda PMCs synthesized in this work are superior to the commercial PMCs in achieving high PCEs.

Besides high efficiency, good long-term stability is also essential to the practical use of OSCs. The intrinsic stability of devices with PMCs and PEDOT:PSS was investigated by monitoring device efficiency in a nitrogen-filled glove box. As shown in Fig. S15,† devices with PMC-4 could keep around 80% of their initial PCE value after a 30 day storage period, showing higher stabilities than the PEDOT:PSS device. However, OSC with PMC-5 shows inferior stability to PMC-4 due to the strong oxidizing property. In addition, as reported in previous works, an excellent thickness insensitivity is considered the essential prerequisite for the AIL to be processed by printing methods.35 Therefore, we examined the effect of PMC thickness variation on device performance. As shown in Fig. 2d–g and Table S3,† PMC-2, PMC-3 and PMC-4 exhibited outstanding thickness insensitivities in modifying OSCs; i.e., even when the thickness of these PMCs reached 40 nm, PCEs over 13% could still be achieved, retaining 80% of the PCEs of the best devices. In contrast, the devices with the commercial PMC-1 and PMC-5 exhibited dramatic declines of PCEs with increasing AIL thickness.
The formation of inorganic–organic electron transfer complex
The high PCE of PMC-modified OSCs suggests the excellent hole collection property of the PMC AILs and the related mechanisms can be analyzed from two aspects. First, benefitting from high WF, electrons will transfer from the polymer donor to the PMC until the Fermi level is aligned and pinned to the EICT+ of the polymer donor, forming a barrier-free interface for hole extraction.36 Second, due to the strong oxidizing property of PMCs, electronic interaction between the PMCs and active layers may occur and further influence both hole extraction and transport of the AIL. As shown in Fig. 3a and S8,† strong electron spin resonance (ESR) signals were detected for the PMC:PBDB-T-2F mixtures with a g value of 2.002, confirming the presence of a charge-transfer complex. Since the LUMO levels of PMCs are located near or below the HOMO of PBDB-T-2F, the electron transfer is energetically favored and induces an inorganic–organic electron transfer complex layer at the AIL/active layer interface. In the complex layer, the transferred electrons in the PMC and the resulting holes in the polymer donor build a depth-dependent electric field (“band bending”), facilitating hole extraction.37

(f) Schematic energy level alignments of anode interlayers and various polymer donors. 
To illustrate the above mechanism, UPS was employed to study the electronic structure of the complex layer using the PMC-4:PBDB-T-2F bilayer as a prototype (Fig. 3b). The variation of WF as a function of PBDB-T-2F film thickness is provided in Fig. 3c. The pure PMC-4 film exhibited a WF of 5.42 eV. After an ultrathin PBDB-T-2F film of 1.5 nm was deposited, the WF dropped to 5.12 eV and gradually decreased to 5.0 eV as the PBDB-T-2F thickness continued to increase to 18 nm. These results indicate the occurrence of Fermi-level pinning, as has been demonstrated in previous studies.38 When the PBDB-T-2F thickness reached 25 nm, the WF of the PMC-4:PBDB-T-2F bilayer was reduced to 4.9 eV, which represents the Fermi level of the bulk polymer; this suggests that the complex layer can extend as far as ca. 25 nm in the active layer. The monotonic decrease in the vacuum level of PMC-4 toward the vacuum level of PBDB-T-2F suggests a barrier-free energy level structure at the PMC-4/PBDB-T-2F interface for hole extraction. Fig. 3c shows the band bending behavior of the HOMO in the complex layer. The ultrathin PBDB-T-2F film deposited on PMC-4 exhibited a HOMO level of −5.15 eV, which is higher than the HOMO level of −5.31 eV for the bulk polymer. The shift in the HOMO level of the complex layer extends to approximately 25 nm, which is consistent with the WF variation, and becomes flattened as the PBDB-T-2F becomes thicker. Based on the above experimental data, we present a schematic diagram to illustrate the formation mechanism of the complex layer, as shown in Fig. 3d. In addition to the spontaneous Fermi-level alignment at the PMC-4/PBDB-T-2F interface, an additional electron transfer reaction occurs between PMC-4 and PBDB-T-2F due to the strong oxidizing property of PMC-4, resulting in a layer of electron transfer complex. The band bending of HOMO in the complex layer improves hole extraction from the active layer to the anode, leading to enhanced OSC performance. In addition, the outstanding capacity of PMC to form a barrier-free heterojunction with an organic semiconductor can be demonstrated by investigating the electronic interaction of PMC-4 with various organic materials. Hole-only devices with the structure of ITO/PMC-4 or PEDOT:PSS/organic material/Au were fabricated to evaluate the energy barriers at the interfaces. Here, a variety of conjugated polymers with different energy levels were selected, including P3HT, PBDB-T, PBDB-T-2F and PBDB-T-4F. The chemical structures of the polymers are provided in Fig. S9.† When reverse bias was applied to the devices, electrons were injected from the ITO electrode and formed a constant electron current. This process equals the hole collection by the ITO electrode. Because Au has been proved to be an efficient hole-transporting material, the PMC-4 or PEDOT:PSS layer on the side of ITO, which is responsible for hole collection, determines the magnitude of the current densities of the whole device. As shown in Fig. 3e, the devices based on PMC-4 showed current densities about one or two orders of magnitude higher than the PEDOT:PSS devices, indicating superior hole collection at the PMC-4/polymer interfaces. It is worth noting that from P3HT to PBDB-T-4F, the current densities of PEDOT:PSS devices gradually decreased, implying that the interfacial barrier might be enlarged with the downshifting of polymer HOMO levels (Fig. 3f). In contrast, all the PMC-4 devices exhibited high current densities regardless of the position of polymer HOMO levels, meaning that PMC-4 can form barrier-free heterojunctions with these polymers. In addition to the formation of barrier-free energy level alignment, the electron transfer from PBDB-T-2F to PMC also increases the carrier density at the interface. Linearly increasing voltage (photo-CELIV) measurements were carried out to estimate the carrier densities of PMC-4 and PEDOT:PSS devices (Fig. S10†). The carrier densities are determined to be 5.7 × 1015 and 2.8 × 1015 cm−3, respectively. The higher density of free carriers in the PMC-4 device indicates an improved charge transport property.
Improvement of thickness insensitivity by molecular polarization
The excellent thickness insensitivity of PMC-2, PMC-3 and PMC-4 was also investigated. Transient photocurrent (TPC) measurements were performed to estimate the decay kinetics of charge carriers in devices with 20 nm PMC AILs (Fig. 4a). Under a bias of 0 V (short-circuit condition), the charge extraction times (τ) were determined to be 64.8, 31.9, 46.9, 16.8 and 133.1 ns for PMC-1, PMC-2, PMC-3, PMC-4 and PMC-5, respectively. The charge extraction times of the PMC-2, PMC-3 and PMC-4 devices were shorter than those of the devices with other PMCs, implying reduced charge recombination in the thick PMC-2, PMC-3 and PMC-4 AILs. These results suggest that the PMC-2, PMC-3 and PMC-4 devices offer more efficient charge collection and transport processing.

The inset is the equivalent circuit model for the Nyquist plots. Rrec = resistance of interfacial recombination, Rseries = series resistance, Rbulk = bulk resistance, Crec = interfacial capacitance, Cbulk = capacitance of the whole cell. (c) DFT-optimized geometrical structures, dipole moments and wave function distributions of frontier orbits for the PMCs. 
In addition to the superior charge transport property, an enhanced capacity to accommodate charge carriers can also depress interfacial charge recombination. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis was performed to measure resistance and capacitance at the AIL/active layer interface with the PMCs' thickness at 20 nm. Fig. 4b presents the Nyquist plots of the devices with different AILs at a potential bias of 0.84 V under dark conditions. The recombination resistance (Rrec) and capacitance (Crec) were obtained by fitting the data using the equivalent circuit model in the inset of Fig. 4b. The Crec values of PMC-2, PMC-3 and PMC-4 devices are almost one order of magnitude higher than in the other two devices (Table S4†). The significant increase in Crec indicated that the capacity to accommodate charge carriers at the PMC/active layer interface was greatly enhanced. As a result, charge recombination could be effectively depressed even when the PMC thickness reached 20 nm, endowing the PMCs with excellent thickness insensitivity in modifying OSCs. The enhanced Crec is derived from the increased dielectric constant related to the molecular polarization of mixed-addenda PMC molecules. A Keggin-type PMC consists of twelve MoO6 or WO6 octahedra surrounding a central XO4 (X= heteroatom such as P, Si, As, Ge, etc.) tetrahedron, with a structural symmetry of Td. Therefore, PMC-1 or PMC-5 has a zero-dipole moment due to its Td symmetry. In the mixed-addenda PMCs, the substitution of W or Mo causes the loss of the symmetry center of the Keggin cluster through a non-uniform electron density distribution, leading to the polarization of PMC molecules. The polarization of PMCs could result in an increased dielectric constant of the capacitor, leading to enhanced capacitance. To verify the above inference, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were conducted to probe the molecular dipole of the PMCs. The ground-state geometries of the PMCs were optimized at the B3LYP level with LANL2DZ for Mo and W atoms and the 6-31G(d) basis set for other atoms.39,40 As shown in Fig. 4c, the LUMO is uniformly distributed over the cage-shaped molecules of PMC-1 and PMC-5 with a molecular dipole of zero. The LUMOs of PMC-2, PMC-3 and PMC-4 relatively concentrate on a semisphere of the molecules, resulting in molecular polarization with dipoles of 0.32–1.62 debye. The above results suggest that increasing capacitance at the interface is a new factor to improve the thickness insensitivity of interlayers.
Large-area printed OSC based on the PMC AIL
Motivated by the above results, we explore the application of PMCs in fabricating large-area OSCs through printing techniques (Fig. 5a). The PMCs were processed by blade-coating to make a 1 cm2 device. The device architecture is the same as that used in the spin-coated devices. The J–V curves of the 1 cm2 devices using the PMC AILs are presented in Fig. S16† and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table S6.† Five PMCs-processed 1 cm2 devices exhibited PCEs of OSC of 1 cm2 with the blade-coated PMC AIL exhibits a PCE of 13.43%, 14.81%, 15.05%, 15.08% and 9.08%, respectively. It is worth noting that PCEs over 15% were obtained in 1 cm2 devices by using PMC-3 and PMC-4 as AILs, results which are among the top values for 1 cm2 OSCs. The OSCs with PMC-1 and PMC-5 exhibited inferior PCEs to the mixed-addenda PMCs due to the poor thickness tolerance. The photovoltaic performance of the large-area OSC (0.8 cm × 0.8 cm mask) modified by PMC-4 was certified by the National Institute of Metrology (NIM) and a certified PCE of 14.3% was acquired (Fig. 5c and S14†). Fig. 5b and Table S5† present a PCE histogram of 30 independent 1 cm2 cells. More than 90% of the cells exhibited PCE values exceeding 14%, suggesting that the blade-coated PMC-4 film can provide steady performance in large-area OSCs; this is essential for industrial production where reproducibility is emphasized.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we synthesized a series of PMCs with gradually changing chemical structures and developed a PMC-4-based AIL as a superior alternative to PEDOT:PSS for the fabrication of OSCs. Compared to PEDOT:PSS, PMC-4 exhibits advantages such as tunable properties, low cost and easy processing without any post-treatment. Benefitting from the optimized photoelectronic properties, the as-synthesized PMC-4 exhibits superiority to PEDOT:PSS and commercial PMCs in improving the PCEs and long-term stability of OSCs; devices with PMC-4 showed an outstanding PCE of 16.3%, which is among the top PCE values of OSCs, with excellent reproducibility. By using ESR and UPS measurements, it is revealed that the PMCs can form an inorganic–organic electron transfer complex with the polymer donor, resulting in an approximately 25 nm-thick region of band bending, which is essential for barrier-free hole extraction. EIS analysis and DFT calculation results indicate that the molecular polarization of mixed-addenda PMCs can enhance the capacitance at the AIL/active layer interfaces, which is proved to be a new factor to improve the thickness insensitivity of interlayers. PMC-4 was processed by blade-coating to make large-area OSCs of 1 cm2 and a certified PCE of 14.3% was achieved. These results suggest that PMCs are not only advantageous in fabricating high-performance OSC devices, but also promising candidates for the future industrial production of OSCs.
