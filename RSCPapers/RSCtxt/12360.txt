    , Accepted 22nd May 2017First published on 22nd May 2017AbstractLithium–sulfur suspension flow batteries are a promising technology for large-scale energy storage, but long-term stability of the suspension catholyte is urgently needed for future application of this system. Here a special self-stabilized suspension catholyte is designed and prepared based on a pie-structured sulfur-Ketjenblack@reduced graphene oxide (S-KB@rGO) composite. In the S-KB@rGO suspension, the sulfur nanoparticles are loaded onto the conductive KB by an in situ redox reaction; the special hyperbranched structure of KB enhances the stability of the suspension; rGO sheets which wrap the S-KB particles not only act as a multilayered physical barrier for sulfur immobilization, but also facilitate electron transportation in the whole suspension. Therefore, a suspension catholyte with long-term physical and electrochemical stability is achieved by the synergetic effect of the KB and rGO. Li–S flow cells with this catholyte show excellent cycle stability (more than 1000 cycles with 99% coulombic efficiency) and low self-discharge (1.1% loss per day). Continuous charge/discharge tests in different flow modes are performed and the influence of the flow rate on the flow battery performance is discussed. The smooth operation in long-lasting flow mode further demonstrates the stability of the suspension catholyte.
1. Introduction
Electrochemical energy storage (EES) devices are crucial to the extensive utilization of unstable and intermittent renewable energy, such as solar and wind systems.1–8 Among different chemistries, redox flow batteries are promising technologies owing to their operation flexibility, easy scalability and high cost effectiveness.3,9,10 Li–S flow batteries attract great interest as they not only take advantage of the properties of flow batteries but also have the specialties of high energy density, low cost and non-toxicity of Li–S batteries.10–15
Several approaches have been proposed to demonstrate the concept of Li–S flow battery systems. One strategy was to make use of the dissolution properties of lithium polysulfides;16–18 this design prolonged the cycle life of the catholyte, while also reducing the active material concentration and utilization. To obtain higher energy density, using element sulfur suspensions is definitely the best choice;19,20 the sulfur utilization could be improved to more than 80% theoretical capacity (5S–26KB, C/9) in the sulfur-impregnated KB catholyte, but its specific capacity lost almost 40% in the initial 5 cycles due to severe shuttle effects.19 Therefore, the cycle stability of the suspension catholyte still needs to be enhanced.
The long-term stability is undoubtedly the fundamental prerequisite for future development of sulfur suspension catholytes. To achieve stable suspensions, active materials should be suspended rather than precipitating; to improve the electrochemical stability, the shuttle effect which still exists in sulfur catholytes should be restrained as much as possible.21–24 Chiang et al.25,26 found that Ketjenblack (KB) could facilitate the dispersion of electrode materials such as LiCoO2, LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 or LiFePO4, and it also can be used as a carrier for sulfur to form a homogeneous suspension due to its hyperbranched structure. A common way to improve cycle stability in traditional lithium sulfur batteries is to encapsulate the active S8 with an effective physical barrier, such as porous carbon,27–31 graphene and its derivatives,21,32–36 conducting polymers37–40 and metal oxide/hydroxide.22,41–44 Polysulfide also can be used as an extrinsic healing agent to enhance the cycle stability of sulfur cathodes.45 These strategies should be also applicable in flow systems by special design.
Herein, we demonstrate a self-stabilized suspension catholyte for Li–S flow batteries designed based on a pie-structured sulfur-Ketjenblack@reduced graphene oxide (S-KB@rGO) composite. In the S-KB@rGO, sulfur nanoparticles are loaded on the KB by an in situ redox reaction; the rGO sheets are wrapped around the S-KB particles by taking advantage of electrostatic attraction. When the S-KB@rGO composite is dispersed in the electrolyte, the hyperbranched KB served as the carrier for sulfur nanoparticles to provide excellent suspensibility, and thus the suspension can remain stable for more than 30 days without precipitation. The flexible rGO sheets can protect sulfur from severe loss and migration during electrochemical processes. In addition, KB nanoparticles together with rGO sheets also form a three-dimensional (3D) continuous conductive network to facilitate both electron and Li+ ion transportation in the whole catholyte. Therefore, Li–S flow cells with this catholyte exhibited outstanding electrochemical performance. The sulfur utilization reached 91.4% (1532 mA h g−1) at 0.05C; upon 1000 cycles a high coulombic efficiency of 99% was achieved; the self-discharge rate was 1.1% per day. A continuous charge/discharge operation in flow mode was demonstrated and the suspension catholyte showed excellent stability under long-lasting working conditions; meanwhile the influence of flow rate and current density on the battery performance was discussed. This strategy of using self-stabilized suspension catholytes offers a promising direction to develop flow energy storage batteries.
2. Experimental
2.1 Synthesis of the S-KB@rGO composite
0.1 g KB was dispersed in 500 mL deionized water uniformly by ultrasonic treatment for 30 minutes, and then 6.2 g (0.025 mol) Na2S2O3·5H2O was dissolved in the mixture. 5.10 g (0.05 mol) HCl (36%) was then injected slowly into the mixture with vigorous stirring for 6 hours at room temperature. Then 50 mL of GO suspension (2 g L−1) was added dropwise, followed by the addition of 5 mL hydrazine hydrate as a reducing agent; ammonia solution (28%) was used to adjust the pH value (pH = 10–11), and the mixture was stirred for 4 hours. HCl was slowly added to the mixture until the solution's pH value reached 2, followed by continuous stirring for 4 hours. The S-KB@rGO composite was collected and washed with deionized water until the washed water was neutral, and then it was dried in a vacuum oven at 55 °C for 12 hours.
A S-KB composite was also synthesized using the same method for comparison.
2.2 Preparation of the S-KB@rGO suspension
All the suspensions demonstrated herein were made with an electrolyte of 1 M LiTFSI and 0.2 M LiNO3 in a DOL and DME (1:1, wt) solution. The S-KB@rGO composite was dispersed in the electrolyte by sonication for 60 minutes to form a homogeneous suspension in drying room with the dew point temperature of −40 °C.
For comparison, a S-KB suspension (with the same sulfur content) was also prepared according to the above method.
2.3 Assembly of button cells
CR2025 button cells were used to evaluate the electrochemical performance of the suspension catholyte in static mode. A piece of lithium foil with 15.8 mm diameter served as the anode and was placed at the bottom of the cell body. A Celgard 2325 separator (16 mm diameter) was placed on the lithium foil. A nickel foam disk (14 mm diameter) was placed on the separator as the current collector of the catholyte due to its special structure and electrochemical stability in the electrochemical potential window which applied in Li–S flow cells (1.5–3.0 V).19 50 μL of catholyte was added into the nickel foam. All cells were assembled in an Ar-filled glovebox.
2.4 Assembly of the flow cell
The structure and photograph of the flow cell are shown in Fig. S1.† One piece of lithium foil (1 × 12 × 65 mm) was placed in the anode frame attached to a copper plate which acted as the current collector of the anode. Two Celgard 2325 separators (0.025 × 20 × 80 mm) soaked in the electrolyte were placed on the surface of the lithium foil. A Teflon flow frame with a reaction channel (1.5 × 10 × 60 mm) was placed on the separator, and a piece of pressed nickel foam current collector (0.5 × 10 × 60 mm) was placed on the reaction channel and was attached to an outer aluminum plate. Then the cell stack was sealed with seal rings and end plates. The catholyte was injected into the cathode reaction frame from the inlet by using a peristaltic pump and flowed out from the outlet. The flow cell was assembled in an Ar-filled glovebox.
2.5 Material characterization
The morphology was investigated using a scanning electron microscope (SEM, Hitachi SU8020) and a transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEM-2100F). The phase analysis was performed by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Rigaku SmartLab 9 kW). Sulfur content was tested by differential scanning calorimetry/thermo-gravimetric analysis (DSC/TGA, SDT-Q600). The suspension catholyte was investigated by using an optical microscope (BX51TRF).
2.6 Electrochemical characterization
All the galvanostatic charge/discharge tests were performed on a Land CT2001A electrochemical testing unit within a potential window of 1.5–2.7 V versus Li+/Li. Constant voltage charge at 2.8 V was performed for electrode protection in flow mode. The specific capacity was calculated based on the mass of sulfur. The energy density was calculated by integrating the discharge capacity and mean discharge potential normalized by the total volume of the suspension. A Zahner IM6 electrochemical workstation was used to perform Cyclic Voltammetry (CV) and Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) studies. The CV tests were conducted in the potential range of 1.5–3.0 V at the OCV of the cells at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s−1. The EIS measurements were swept from 100 kHz to 0.1 Hz at the OCV of the cells with an amplitude of 10 mV.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Suspension catholyte preparation and material characterization
The synthesis of the S-KB@rGO composite is schematically shown in Fig. 1a. The KB nanoparticles served as the carrier for sulfur due to their nanoscale hyperbranched structure and high conductivity (Fig. 2a and S2a†). The large specific surface area (1400 m2 g−1) of KB is helpful in sulfur loading; meanwhile hyperbranched KB served as a template that can assist sulfur in forming nanoparticles. The S-KB nanoparticles were achieved by the disproportionation reaction of Na2S2O3 with HCl; nanoscale S8 was impregnated into KB matrices.46 The KB and sulfur bind tightly and form uniform S-KB nanoparticles; no big sulfur particles are observed (Fig. 2b and S2b†), implying that the sulfur particles were orientated and deposited onto the carrier material.

S-KB particles were wrapped by rGO sheets by taking advantage of strong electrostatic attraction. In brief, the GO suspension was added into the S-KB solution, and the GO was reduced by hydrazine hydrate. The pH value of the solution was kept at about 10; both rGO sheets and S-KB particles were negatively charged. When the pH of the solution was decreased to 2 by using HCl, the zeta potential of S-KB will slowly become positive while the rGO sheets remain negative; therefore, the electrostatic attraction could direct the wrapping of rGO sheets on the surface of S-KB particles,32,46,47 and a pie-structured S-KB@rGO composite was formed. The SEM and TEM images of the S-KB@rGO composite (Fig. 2c and S2c†) clearly reveal successful wrapping of rGO sheets on the external surface of the S-KB. It is difficult to distinguish the KB and sulfur particles in the S-KB or S-KB@rGO composites (Fig. 2b and c); the possible reason is that the sulfur is well dispersed in the pores of the KB particles due to the excellent wettability between carbon and sulfur. XRD patterns confirmed the existence of sulfur in S-KB and S-KB@rGO composites (Fig. S3†). Energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS) elemental mappings show that sulfur and carbon are uniformly dispersed in a selected region of the composite (Fig. S4†). The S content in the composite was confirmed by a DSC/TGA test in a nitrogen flow (Fig. 3). All the curves show a weight loss from ∼150 °C to ∼350 °C, while both KB and rGO are stable in this temperature range; therefore, the weight loss should be ascribed to the consumption of sulfur, and the S content of the S-KB and S-KB@rGO is 80.58% and 77.92%, respectively. The sulfur load in S-KB@rGO is quite satisfactory, since it is well accepted that the content of sulfur should exceed 50% for practical use.48 It should be noted that the sulfur in the S-KB@rGO composite exhibits a better thermal stability compared with pure sulfur and S-KB, which indicates the strong interaction between the sulfur and the carrier network formed by KB particles and rGO sheets.49

The suspension catholyte was prepared by dispersing the S-KB@rGO in the electrolyte (Fig. 1b). The diffusion-limited cluster aggregated S-KB@rGO particles are dispersed uniformly in the electrolyte to form a percolating conductor network (Fig. S5†), and interactions between S-KB@rGO particles are typically dominated by colloidal rather than gravitational forces to form a stable suspension.25 The layered rGO sheets wrapped on the surface of the S-KB can protect sulfur from severe loss and migration, and meanwhile, the flexible rGO particles which intersect with each other, together with KB, form a continuous 3D carrier network in the suspension to further enhance the conductivity and stability of the whole catholyte.
3.2 Electrochemical performance of the S-KB@rGO catholyte
We first evaluated whether the suspension precipitates during a long term charge/discharge process in the static state by an electrochemical method. In brief, the suspension was injected into the flow cell (Fig. S1b†) by using a peristaltic pump (see the Experimental section for details), and then the cell was placed vertically and continuous charge/discharge tests were conducted in the static state. The profiles are smooth and no fluctuation is observed as shown in Fig. 4a; the two discharge plateaus are distinct, and the specific capacities are close to theoretical values and do not fade in two cycles. The voltage of lithium intercalation into a cathode host can be represented by the following equation:50,51 (1)where xi and xj are the limits of the intercalation reaction, V is the average equilibrium voltage, and e is the electron charge. According to this equation, the voltage profiles will fluctuate if the active materials precipitate. It should be noted that the cell is put vertically, and the height of the suspension is 60 mm; there will be large difference between the top and the bottom of the suspension if precipitation takes place, which will lead to voltage variation and capacity fading. Therefore, the smooth voltage profiles and stable capacity during a more than 60-hour charge/discharge process indicate the self-stabilized properties of the S-KB@rGO suspension catholyte. In addition, the suspension was allowed to stand for 30 days and no precipitate was observed (Fig. S6†).

(g) Self-discharge: the discharge profiles before and after rest. 
Button cells were used to evaluate the electrochemical performance of the S-KB@rGO catholyte in the static state. Fig. 4b shows the charge/discharge profiles of the S-KB@rGO suspension catholyte at different C rates (1C = 1675 mA h g−1). Two typical discharge plateaus were detected in 2.25 V and 2.05 V regions at a 0.05C rate, which is in accordance with the CV profiles (Fig. S7a†). The discharge capacity of the suspension catholyte reached 1532 mA h g−1 at 0.05C with a sulfur utilization of 91.4%, which is comparable with that of conventional solid cathodes using similar sulfur-carbon composites.33,52–54 Moreover, the suspension catholyte delivered a high specific capacity of 749 mA h g−1 and 410 mA h g−1 at 1C and 3C, respectively. The discharge tests of the S-KB suspension catholyte were also conducted for comparison (Fig. S7b†), and the S-KB@rGO suspension showed much better rate performances. The rate capability under continuous rate charge/discharge revealed the excellent durability of the S-KB@rGO suspension catholyte (Fig. S7c†). The high electrochemical activity of the S-KB@rGO catholyte derives from the synergistic contributions of KB particles and rGO sheets that form a 3D conductive network to support sufficient electrochemical reaction sites and fast electron/ion transfer channels; meanwhile the nickel foam served as a current collector also facilitating electron transfer.55,56
The discharge capacity of the catholyte with varied S-KB@rGO contents was also tested as shown in Fig. 4c. When the S-KB@rGO content was 38, 73, 138 and 198 g L−1 in the catholyte, the specific capacity was 1509, 1500, 1288 and 1220 mA h g−1 (0.05C), and a volumetric energy of 96, 181, 292 and 400 W h L−1 was achieved, respectively (the discharge voltage is set to 2.1 V in calculating the volumetric energy of the suspension catholyte). Considering both the catholyte and the lithium anode, the volumetric energy of the flow cell reached 92, 197, 258 and 338 W h L−1, respectively (the capacity of lithium is set to 1000 mA h cm−3, half of its theoretical capacity for the low coulombic efficiency of lithium).16 Even the minimum value is two times higher than that of all-vanadium catholytes with a concentration of 1.7 M.2 In addition, when the S-KB@rGO content increased gradually, the utilization of sulfur (specific capacity) did not drop so much, indicating excellent conductivity and homogeneous properties of the suspension.
A long-term cycling test was conducted in the potential range from 1.5 to 2.7 V at a constant charge/discharge rate of 0.5C (Fig. 4d) to evaluate the electrochemical reversibility of the S-KB@rGO suspension catholyte. The S-KB suspension catholyte was also tested under the same conditions to verify the cooperative functions of rGO sheets. The S-KB catholyte, as a whole, exhibited poor cycle stability. The specific capacity of the S-KB catholyte was 1014 mA h g−1 in the first cycle, but it decreased quickly to 460 mA h g−1 in 400 cycles. The rapid decrease may be mainly attributed to the migration and loss of polysulfides during cycling. Comparing with the conventional sulfur cathode, more electrolytes are employed to form flow configuration in this system, and lithium polysulfides are more probable to be exposed to the electrolyte directly in the S-KB catholyte, which may lead to higher shuttle possibility and cause rapid capacity fading.57 In a sharp contrast, the S-KB@rGO suspension catholyte showed more stable cycle performances. It outputs an initial specific capacity of 899 mA h g−1, in the following cycles, and the capacity of the S-KB@rGO suspension catholyte rose slowly to a maximum reversible value of 980 mA h g−1 (40th cycle) and remained steady; this was mostly due to the gradual activation of internal sulfur well-wrapped by rGO. The S-KB@rGO suspension delivered a specific capacity of 837 mA h g−1 in the 400th cycle with a capacity retention ratio of 93.1%, which was about two times higher than that of the S-KB catholyte (45.4%). The above evidence confirms that the outer rGO sheets do play an important role in improving the cycle stability of the sulfur suspension catholyte.
The S-KB@rGO suspension catholyte was tested for more than 1000 cycles at 1C to further identify the long-term cycle stability (Fig. 4e). In the initial 400 cycles, the capacity of the S-KB@rGO suspension catholyte increased from 693 mA h g−1 to a top level of 786 mA h g−1 in the 220th cycle and remained stable at ∼730 mA h g−1; this is also due to the gradual activation of internal sulfur well-wrapped by rGO,22 which is in accordance with 0.5C cycling. The S-KB@rGO catholyte still outputs a capacity of 368.6 mA h g−1 after 1000 cycles, with a capacity retention of 53.2%, corresponding to a very low capacity decay of 0.047% per cycle, and at the same time, the coulombic efficiency remained at ∼99%. The typical charge/discharge voltage profiles were extracted from the cycling test (Fig. S7d†); the consistent voltage profiles during cycling further illustrated the electrochemical stability of the S-KB@rGO catholyte.
To attain valuable insights into the cycling information, a pseudo-in situ EIS technique was employed to further analyze the electrochemical stability of the S-KB@rGO catholyte during cycling. As shown in Fig. 4f, the ohmic resistance and charge transfer resistance are almost constant in different cycling periods, and the interfacial resistances are stable except the first one, which is in accordance with the cycling test and the extracted discharge profiles. Negligible change of the electrochemical impedance during cycling proves the good electrochemical stability of the S-KB@rGO suspension catholyte once again.
The self-discharge behavior of the S-KB@rGO suspension catholyte was also investigated (Fig. 4g). The cell was first cycled several times to obtain stable capacity, and then it was rested in the fully charged state for 28 days and discharged at the same rate as previous cycling. The discharge capacity after rest was 983 mA h g−1; it was 68% of the previous discharge (1445 mA h g−1), corresponding to an average self-discharge rate of 1.1% per day, which is much lower than that of the polysulfide catholyte (6.5%).16 Moreover, the capacity could be almost fully recovered in the following cycle, demonstrating that the self-discharge does not damage the reversible capacity of the suspension catholyte. Low self-discharge indicates that the migration of polysulfides is restrained in the suspension catholyte; meanwhile, it also means low energy loss, which is important for the application in the energy storage industry.
3.3 Flow mode tests of the flow cell
The electrochemical performance of the flow cell (the flow battery system is shown in Fig. S8†) was tested in an intermittent-flow mode which not only permits straightforward electrochemical analysis but also demonstrates the flowability of the suspension catholyte.17,25,58 In this approach, one part of the suspension was injected into the reaction channel of the flow cell; it was replaced with the fresh one by using a peristaltic pump immediately when it was fully discharged/charged for one cycle. Fig. 5a shows four iterations of charge/discharge profiles of the Li–S-KB@rGO suspension flow cell at a 0.05C rate; the catholyte outputs a specific capacity of 1320 mA h g−1 with a coulombic efficiency of 96.4% in the first cycle (138 g L−1 S-KB@rGO), and the corresponding volumetric energy reaches 287 W h L−1. The high specific capacity and coulombic efficiency of the suspension are significant as they indicate that the S-KB@rGO catholyte is highly electroactive in the reaction zone of the flow cell. Fig. 5b shows the cycle performance of the flow cell in the intermittent-flow mode; the coulombic efficiency remains above 90%, and the specific energy decreases in the first several cycles and then remains stable. The specific energy fading during the initial cycles is likely due to the electroactive zone extension,59 in which the catholyte's high electronic conductivity allowed the material to be cycled outside the channel slightly.

(c) Deep charge/discharge test in flow mode. Charge/discharge profiles at varied (d) current densities and (e) flow rates in flow mode. (f) Power density of the Li–S-KB@rGO flow cell at different flow rates. (g) Galvanostatic cycling test of the Li–S-KB@rGO flow cell in multiple operating modes. 
A deep charge/discharge test was conducted in flow mode in a potential window of 15–2.8 V at a current density of 1 mA cm−2, and a 73 g L−1 S-KB@rGO suspension was used as the catholyte. There are also two discharge plateaus at about 2.25 V and 2.05 V as shown in Fig. 5c; the high plateau at 2.25 V corresponds to the opening ring reduction of cyclic S8 to higher-order lithium polysulfides (Li2Sn, 4 ≤ n ≤ 8), and the low plateau at 2.05 V can be attributed to the further reduction of these polysulfides to Li2S2 and Li2S eventually. The charge plateau was detected at about 2.5 V, corresponding to the conversion of the lithium sulfide or polysulfides to S8.14 The electrochemical behaviour of the catholyte in flow mode is in line with that in the static state.
We investigated the influence of charge/discharge current density and flow rate on the electrochemical performance of the Li–S-KB@rGO suspension flow cell. In these tests, the suspension was only partially charged/discharged during its residence time in the flow channel. Fig. 5c shows the discharge profiles at different current densities at a flow rate of 10 mL min−1; the flow cell is first discharged at the density of 0.25 mA cm−2 for 2 hours, and then it is charged at the same current density to the cut-off voltage of 2.8 V, and then it is charged at a constant voltage of 2.8 V for electrode protection; the whole charged time is 2 hours. According to this method, a charge/discharge test was conducted on the flow cell at different current densities, and the discharge plateau reduced with the increase of current density owing to polarization at high current density. The rate performance in flow mode is similar to that in static mode, indicating the perfect homogeneity of the suspension.
A continuous charge/discharge test was conducted on the flow cell at flow rates of 5, 10 and 30 mL min−1 at a current density of 1 mA cm−2 (Fig. 5d). The discharge plateaus rose at increased flow rates. For instance, the plateau at 30 mL min−1 was raised by 82 mV compared with the plateau observed at 5 mL min−1. We believe that this is related to the excellent conduction of the S-KB@rGO suspension; the continuous 3D conductivity network constructed by KB and rGO in the suspension can facilitate electron and ion transportation under flow conditions. In addition, the S-KB@rGO catholyte, similar to other semi-solid catholytes,20,25,26,60 exhibits non-Newtonian fluid characteristics, whose viscosity reduces with increasing flow velocity, which facilitates ion transfer. To further investigate the influence of flow rate on the rate discharge performance of the suspension catholyte, the power capability was tested by linear sweep voltammetry. Fig. 5f shows the power density of the S-KB@rGO suspension flow cell at the flow velocity of 5, 10, and 30 mL min−1, and the achieved peak power density is 9.6, 12.9, and 15.5 mW cm−2, respectively. The power density is improved by 61% when the flow rate is accelerated from 5 to 30 mL min−1.
The discharge behaviour of the high-concentration suspension of 138 g L−1 S-KB@rGO was also investigated in a flow battery system (Fig. S9†); smooth flow operation was performed at different current densities and flow rates. We also observed decrease in the discharge plateau by increasing current density from 0.5 to 2.5 mA cm−2; and the plateau was raised at increased flow rates from 5 to 45 mL min−1, which is similar to that of the 73 g L−1 suspension catholyte.

Fig. 5g shows the long-term operation of the suspension catholyte in continuous flow mode, and the flow rates are set sequentially at 5, 10, 20, 30 and 45 mL min−1 in each sequence; meanwhile, the current density is increased from 0.5 to 2.5 mA cm−2. Smooth operation can be achieved in each sequence, and the charge/discharge profiles were continuous and stable during the whole process, indicating high homogeneity of the suspension. In addition, no clogging of the suspension in the flowing tube was observed in the continuous operation over 50 hours; actually, the whole working time was more than 150 hours plus the operation time shown in Fig. 5c–e (these tests were stopped after manual termination), which further demonstrated its long-term stability and durability. The suspension catholyte after long-term cycling was taken out, washed with acetone and dried for the microscopy analysis. It can be seen that the microstructure of the S-KB@rGO composite is well conserved after the cycling test (Fig. S10a†), and the S-KB nanoparticles are still well-wrapped by rGO sheets; meanwhile, EDS elemental mappings show that sulfur and carbon are uniformly distributed in the selected region of the composite (Fig. S10b–d†). The perfect structural stability of the S-KB@rGO composite can ensure long-term uniformity of the suspension catholyte during cycling in flow mode. We believe that further optimizations on the cell stack and current collector design, reducing internal contact resistance of the flow cell and improving the ionic conductivity of the electrolyte, will improve the electrochemical performance of this flow battery system.
4. Conclusion
In summary, a novel self-stabilized catholyte enabled by a nano-pie-structured S-KB@rGO composite for Li–S flow batteries was demonstrated here. A continuous conducting network was formed by the KB and rGO sheets to enhance ion transportation; meanwhile it also served as a holder for sulfur or polysulfide to improve physical and electrochemical stability. The S-KB@rGO catholyte exhibited stable cycle performances (low capacity decay rate of 0.047% and high coulombic efficiency of 99% in 1000 cycles), high specific energy (400 W h L−1) and a low self-discharge rate (1.1% loss per day). The laboratory scale Li–S flow cell showed stable charge/discharge performance with high coulombic efficiency in intermittent-flow and continuous flow modes, which certifies the feasibility of the S-KB@rGO suspension cathode under practical working conditions. The concept of sulfur suspension catholytes improves the cycle stability which is urgently needed for the large-scale application of Li–S flow batteries, and this strategy also offers a promising direction for the development of other flow batteries.
