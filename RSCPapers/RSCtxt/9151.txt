    , Accepted 4th January 2022First published on 6th January 2022AbstractSinglet fission has attracted extensive attention from experimentalists and theoreticians due to its ability to improve the photovoltaic conversion efficiency. Still, designing singlet fission materials remains challenging. In this work, we explored the relationship between adaptive aromaticity and singlet fission potentials by computationally screening the adaptive aromatic species reported by our group. Adaptive aromaticity refers to species with aromaticity in the lowest singlet and the lowest triplet states, and density functional theory calculations reveal that species with adaptive aromaticity usually generate an intermediate E(T1)a value (singlet–triplet gaps). In most cases, species with adaptive aromaticity satisfy the thermodynamic requirements of the singlet fission process (2E(T1) < E(S1) and 2E(T1) < E(T2)). Thus, our findings demonstrate that adaptive aromaticity could provide an alternative strategy for experimentalists and theoreticians to design singlet fission materials.
1 Introduction
Solar energy is the most abundant and widely used renewable clean resource. In recent years, the application of solar energy to photoelectric,1,2 photothermal,3 and photochemical4,5 conversion has attracted widespread attention from experimentalists and theoreticians. How to use it effectively remains a challenge and solar power generation6–8 is one of the applications. According to the Shockley–Queisser limit,9,10 the maximum photovoltaic conversion efficiency of a single p–n junction cell is only 33.7%, which is mainly caused by the inability to fully utilize low-energy photons, and partially absorbed solar energy is dissipated as heat. One potential strategy for overcoming this limitation and significantly improving the efficiency of a solar cell is to incorporate singlet fission materials11 into the device.
Singlet fission11 is a photophysical process in which an organic chromophore absorbs one photon and splits a high-energy singlet exciton into two relatively low-energy triplet excitons, significantly increasing the photoelectric conversion of solar cells through the exciton multiplication process.12 For the process of singlet fission, Michl11 and his co-workers summarized two criteria to evaluate whether a chromophore has singlet fission potential, which has been widely used to explore new singlet fission molecules through theoretical calculations.13 The first criterion is that the process should be exothermic. Specifically, the excitation energy of the lowest singlet state (S1) should be higher than twice that of the lowest triplet state (T1): 2E(T1) < E(S1). The second criterion is to avoid the process of triplet–triplet annihilation.14 Thus, the excitation energy of the second triplet state (T2) should be higher than twice that of the T1 state: 2E(T1) < E(T2). Based on the two criteria, Michl11 and co-workers predicted that large alternant polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons have the potential of singlet fission materials. Singlet fission was first observed in anthracene crystals,15 and subsequently, tetracene and pentacene have been successively proved to be good chromophores in this process.16,17 Note that the first singlet fission candidate predicted by theoretical calculations and confirmed experimentally was 1,3-diphenylisobenzofuran,18 which has diradicaloid character. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons also exhibit diradicaloid character,19–24 which means that the two electrons occupy two nearly degenerate molecular orbitals and the electronic structure of diradicaloid is between the open-shell (pure diradical) and closed-shell singlet nature, making them unstable under the atmosphere of air and water. Nakano and co-workers25 quantified the relationship between diradical character (y0), tetraradical character (y1), and singlet fission potential, where both y0 and y1 have values in the range of 0 to 1, with 0 representing the closed-shell and 1 indicating pure diradical (y0) and pure tetraradical (y1) character in the ground state, respectively. They found that singlet fission occurs more frequently in diradicaloid (0 < y0 < 1) rather than pure diradicals and closed-shell singlet ones.25 In recent years, theoreticians13 have proposed some strategies that might improve the stability of singlet fission chromophores, such as introducing heteroatoms or functionalizing polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons26–31 and stabilizing the radical centers by the captodative effect.32–35 In addition, it would be an added bonus if the chromophores satisfy E(T1) ≈ 1.1 eV and E(S1) < E(T2), since 1.1 eV is close to the bandgap of the commonly used silicon, whereas the latter avoids the intersystem crossing between the S1 and T2 states. The field of singlet fission has made great progress both theoretically and experimentally over the past few decades.11,13,22,36–44
Aromaticity, as an ancient and important concept in chemistry, has attracted much attention from theoreticians and experimentalists.45–51 Compared with the ground-state aromaticity, the development of excited-state aromaticity is relatively limited.52–55 According to Hückel's and Baird's rules,56 the aromaticity of planar, conjugated, and cyclic species in the ground state should be reversed in the excited state. As we all know, aromaticity can enhance the stability of species, whereas anti-aromaticity can cause instability. In 2019, the Bronstein group57 designed a series of highly stable singlet fission chromophores by using the concept of excited-state aromaticity to adjust the singlet–triplet energy gap. In the following year, the Ottosson group58 developed a general strategy for designing new singlet fission candidates, using Baird's 4n rule for the excited state and Hückel's 4n + 2 rule for the ground state. According to Baird's and Hückel's rules, the species usually display one-state aromaticity either in the ground or excited state. However, a series of unusual compounds exhibiting aromaticity in both the ground and excited states have been reported recently.
In 2018, the Zhu group59 first discovered that 16-valence-electron osmapentalene 16.Os.Cl is aromatic in both the lowest singlet (S0) and the lowest triplet (T1) states and termed such two-state aromaticity as “adaptive aromaticity” (Fig. 1). The nucleus-independent chemical shift (NICS)60–64 is one of the easiest indices to evaluate aromaticity based on magnetic properties and NICS(1)zz is recommended for evaluating the π aromaticity in the S0 and T1 states,65,66 whereas NICS(0) is more suitable for probing σ aromaticity because σ-electrons are delocalized in the ring plane. A distinctly negative NICS value indicates aromaticity whereas a distinctly positive one suggests anti-aromaticity, and a close-to-zero one denotes non-aromaticity. Although the metal centers may affect the NICS values due to the local magnetic behavior,67 our previous work49 on some organometallics shows that the trend of NICS values is consistent with other aromatic indices. So we choose the NICS(1)zz value as the aromatic index in this work. The NICS(1)zz grids for 16.Os.Cl are shown in dark blue with NICS(1)zz values of −26.2 and −22.5 ppm for each 5MR in the S0 and T1 states (Fig. 1a), respectively. Note that the NICS grid shows magnetic shielding (dark blue) in the aromatic ring and de-shielding (dark red) in the anti-aromatic ring, respectively. In addition, the anisotropy of the induced current density analysis (ACID, Fig. 1b) agrees with that of the NICS analysis. The clockwise ring current suggests aromaticity, whereas the anti-clockwise ring current suggests anti-aromaticity, with no significant ring currents being shown in non-aromatic species. In addition, the Zhu group also revealed that from the S0 to T1 states, compound 16.Os.Cl underwent an electron excitation mode from the out-of-plane HOMO (π bonding) to the in-plane LUMO (σ antibonding) rather than out-of-plane ππ*, and the unpaired electrons were mainly localized at the metal center (Fig. 1c), leading to the retention of π aromaticity in the T1 state. After that, adaptive aromaticity has also been found using theoretical calculations in osmapyridinium with phosphonium substituents,68 metallapentalenes, and metallasilapentalynes with strong electron-donor ligands,69,70 cyclo[10]carbon,71 tetraatomic boron species,72 pyrrole ring of the polycyclic dipyrrolonaphthyridinedione skeleton,73 and the unsaturated three-membered rings.74 In particular, the dipyrrolonaphthyridinedione has been reported by experimentalists and theoreticians as an excellent singlet fission chromophore.73

2 Results and discussion
According to Baird's and Hückel's rules, the species with aromaticity in the S0 state usually have a relatively high singlet–triplet energy gap (the adiabatic excitation energy E(T1)a) due to the T1 state being de-stabilized by anti-aromaticity (benzene, Fig. 2), resulting in low values of E(S1)v/E(T1)a (1.40) and E(T2)v/E(T1)a (1.28) that do not satisfy the thermodynamic requirements of the singlet fission process. In contrast, species with anti-aromaticity in the S0 state are not only difficult to synthesize, but also have low E(T1)a values (pentalene, Fig. 2). The excitation energy ratios are allowed to satisfy the thermodynamic requirements of singlet fission, but the low E(T1)a value also leads to relatively high E(S1)v/E(T1)a (4.24) and E(T2)v/E(T1)a (4.54) values, resulting in heat loss. In other words, the species with adaptive aromaticity have an intermediate E(T1)a value because aromaticity stabilizes both the S0 and T1 states. This implies that the concept of adaptive aromaticity (except for the triplet ground state)68 could be used to design novel chromophores with singlet fission potential by tuning the singlet–triplet gap. In this work, we focus on this hypothesis and investigate the relationship between adaptive aromaticity and singlet fission potential by examining whether species with adaptive aromaticity satisfy the two criteria: 2E(T1) < E(S1) and 2E(T1) < E(T2). Previously reported species with adaptive aromaticity were selected as computational models in this work.

The blue block suggests aromaticity, the red block suggests anti-aromaticity, and the yellow block suggests non-aromaticity, respectively. 
To probe whether species with adaptive aromaticity can be used to design singlet fission materials, we first compared the excitation energies and excitation energy ratios of metallabicycles (Fig. 2) used in the first report of adaptive aromatics.59 As shown in Fig. 2, compounds 18.Os.Cl, 16.Os.Cl, and 18.Os.CO are both aromatic (blue block) and have similar NICS(1)zz values in the S0 state (18.Os.Cl: NICS(1)zz values for the two rings are −26.6 and −21.0 ppm, respectively, 16.Os.Cl: −26.2 ppm, and 18.Os.CO: −28.1 ppm), but with anti-aromaticity (red block, NICS(1)zz values for the two rings are 8.7 and 15.2 ppm, respectively), aromaticity (−22.5 ppm) and non-aromaticity (yellow block, −0.7 ppm) in the T1 state, respectively. As expected, the E(T1)a value is relatively low for 16.Os.Cl (dashed line, 1.06 eV) and relatively high for 18.Os.Cl (dashed line, 1.94 eV) due to the T1 state being stabilized by aromaticity and de-stabilized by anti-aromaticity, respectively. In particular, the E(T1)a value of compound 16.Os.Cl with adaptive aromaticity is close to the bandgap of silicon (1.1 eV), motivating us to investigate whether the species in Fig. 2 satisfy the two singlet fission criteria (E(S1)v/E(T1)a > 2 and E(T2)v/E(T1)a > 2). Interestingly, the excitation energy ratios of compounds 18.Os.Cl (E(S1)v/E(T1)a: 1.47, E(T2)v/E(T1)a: 1.26) and 18.Os.CO (E(S1)v/E(T1)a: 1.41, E(T2)v/E(T1)a: 1.60) are relatively low, and only compound 16.Os.Cl with adaptive aromaticity satisfies the two singlet fission criteria, with values of 2.05 and 2.19 for E(S1)v/E(T1)a and E(T2)v/E(T1)a (Fig. 2), respectively. Note that we only aim to investigate whether the concept of adaptive aromaticity can be used to design new singlet fission chromophores in this work. Thus, any heavy-atom effect (the spin–orbit coupling (SOC) values for S1/Tn are shown in Table S1†), oscillator strength (see Table S2†), and other non-radiative decay pathways are not considered in this proof-of-concept study. The yi values for key species are listed in Table S3.† Preliminary studies indicate that compound 16.Os.Cl with adaptive aromaticity has the potential to act as a singlet fission candidate.
Recently, the Zhu group69 reported a systematic study of the excited-state (T1 state) aromaticity of 16-valence-electron metallapentalenes (metal = Re+, Os2+, Ir3+) using density functional theory (DFT) calculations, and found that the adaptive aromaticity of 16-valence-electron metallapentalenes can be achieved by the spin delocalization mechanism using strong σ- or π-donor ligands to stabilize the electron-deficient metal centers. Since the compound 16.Os.Cl could satisfy the thermodynamic requirements for the singlet fission process in the above discussion, we continue to explore the relationship between the electron-donating ability of the ligand and the singlet fission potential by replacing the ligand.
Using compound 16.Os.Cl as a model, we found that both the adiabatic excitation from the S0 to the T1 state and the vertical excitation from the S0 to the S1 state undergo an electron excitation mode from out-of-plane (HOMO) to in-plane (LUMO). The HOMO and LUMO of compound 16.Os.Cl in the S0 state, and the HSOMO and HSOMO-1 in the T1 state are plotted in Fig. 3. Notably, Zhu's group69 previously found via charge decomposition analysis that the stronger the electron-donating ability of the ligand X, the higher the energy of its corresponding np orbital, 2p (F) < 3p (Cl) < 4p (Br) < 5p (I), and the more significant the lone pair character of the ligand in the HOMO. As shown in Fig. 4, the significant lone pair character also leads to the relatively high energy of the HOMO, 16.Os.I (−9.79 eV) > 16.Os.Br (−10.14 eV) > 16.Os.Cl (−10.30 eV) > 16.Os.F (−10.39 eV). Based on this phenomenon, we speculate that the stronger the electron-donating ability of ligand X, the lower the corresponding E(T1)a and E(S1)v values.

To understand the relationship between the electron-donating ability of the ligand X and singlet fission potential, we divided each 16.Os.X (X = F, Cl, Br, and I) into two fragments, and quantified the bonding interactions using the principal interacting orbital (PIO) analysis (Fig. 4).75,76 PIO can decompose the total interaction into each paired orbital interaction, where the PIO-based bond index (PBI, ranging from 0–2) is used to quantitatively describe the magnitude of each PIO pair, with strong orbital interactions typically having relatively high PBI values. The top two PIO pairs of each compound are presented in Fig. 4. The first PIO pair (the highest contribution) of 16.Os.X is the σ bond formation, whereas the second PIO pair is the π bond formation. The PBI values for the first PIO pair of 16.Os.F, 16.Os.Cl, 16.Os.Br and 16.Os.I are 0.472, 0.636, 0.684, and 0.751 with the X atoms providing 1.73e, 1.60e, 1.56e and 1.50e, whereas the metal centers only provide 0.27e, 0.40e, 0.44e, and 0.50e, respectively. The PIO values of the second PIO pair are 0.267, 0.394, 0.435, and 0.501, respectively, and the X atoms also provide relatively more electrons. The total interactions (the sum of PBI) show a trend of 16.Os.I (1.32) > 16.Os.Br (1.18) > 16.Os.Cl (1.09) > 16.Os.F (0.81), indicating that the stronger the electron-donating ability of the ligand X, the stronger the total interaction between the metal center and the ligand X.
The excitation energy ratios of 16.Os.X with adaptive aromaticity are listed in Fig. 5. Calculations show that the values of E(T1)a and E(S1)v and the ratio of E(S1)v/E(T1)a decrease whereas the ratio of E(T2)v/E(T1)a increases upon increasing the electron-donating capacity of ligand X. PIO analysis (Fig. 4) shows that compounds 16.Os.F and 16.Os.Cl have total interactions of 0.81 and 1.09, respectively, whereas the total interactions of 16.Os.Br (1.18) and 16.Os.I (1.32) are relatively high. Note that only compounds 16.Os.F and 16.Os.Cl satisfy the two thermodynamic requirements for the singlet fission process with E(S1)v/E(T1)a values of 2.05 and 2.05, and E(T2)v/E(T1)a values of 2.05 and 2.19, respectively. When the electron-donating ability of ligand X is relatively strong, the value of E(S1)v/E(T1)a is relatively low (16.Os.Br: 1.97, 16.Os.I: 1.89). This finding leads us to speculate that the too strong total interaction between the metal center and ligand X is not favorable for the 16.M.X system with adaptive aromaticity to satisfy the thermodynamic requirements of the singlet fission process. To verify this hypothesis, we compared four species with adaptive aromaticity (Fig. 6). The total interaction between the metal center and ligand X of compounds 16.Os.OH (1.12) and 16.Os.SnCl3 (1.08) is higher than that of compound 16.Os.F (0.81), but smaller than that of compound 16.Os.Br (1.18). DFT calculations show that compounds 16.Os.OH and 16.Os.SnCl3 are thermodynamically adapted to the singlet fission process, with E(S1)v/E(T1)a values of 2.20 and 2.24, respectively, and the E(T2)v/E(T1)a values of 2.13 and 2.34. In addition, we explored the relationship between the metal center and the singlet fission potential (Fig. 6). The PIO analysis showed that the total interaction between the electron-deficient metal center and the ligand X is stronger, 16.Ir.SnCl3 (1.47) > 16.Os.SnCl3 (1.08) > 16.Re.SnCl3 (0.97), and compounds 16.Ir.SnCl3, 16.Os.SnCl3 and 16.Re.SnCl3 have singlet fission potential when ligand X is SnCl3−.

Compared to metallic chromophores, small organic chromophores have the advantages of avoiding heavy atom effects, reduced intersystem crossing ability, and generally higher synthetic ability. Therefore, they have received extensive attention from experimentalists and theoreticians.11,13 A previous report has confirmed that cyclic[10]carbon has adaptive aromaticity,71 but DFT calculations showed that it is not a good singlet fission candidate (see Fig. S1†). Moreover, we also noticed in a recent report77 that both S0 and T1 states are aromatic when the hydrogen atom of benzene is substituted with a strong π-acceptor (Fig. 7, R group: NO2, NO, CHO and COCH3). However, the spin populations (Mulliken method) on the R group are 1.90 (Ph.NO2), 1.75 (Ph.NO), 1.63 (Ph.CHO) and 1.61 (Ph.COCH3), respectively, and only a few unpaired electrons are distributed on the benzene ring, implying that the aromaticity in the T1 state originates from the Hückel aromaticity being preserved. Our ongoing interest in the field of excited state aromaticity59,68 and singlet fission73 prompted us to explore the relationship between the substituted benzene and singlet fission potential (Fig. 7). Calculations show that the strong π-acceptor NO not only makes the substituted benzene aromatic in the S0 and T1 states (Ph.NO: NICS(1)zz,s0 = −28.6 ppm, NICS(1)zz,T1 = −25.7 ppm) but also makes it satisfy the thermodynamic criterion of E(T2)v/E(T1)a > 2. Unfortunately, the values of E(T1)a and E(S1)v for Ph.NO do not satisfy the thermodynamic criterion E(S1)v/E(T1)a > 2 for the singlet fission process. We also notice that for both the adiabatic excitation from the S0 to T1 state and the vertical excitation from the S0 to S1 state of compound Ph.NO, the electron excitation mode is from σ to π* orbitals (HOMO → LUMO) (Fig. 8). The orbital composition analysis shows that the contribution of the para-carbon atom to the LUMO in the S0 state is 13.0%, and the two ortho-carbon atoms have relatively low contributions of 11.4% and 6.9%, respectively. Then, we hypothesize that the introduction of a strong electron-donating group (EDG) or electron-withdrawing group (EWG) in the para-position (the highest contribution on the benzene ring) might change the E(T1)a and E(S1)v values of Ph.NO.

To explore the relationship between the substituent effect, aromaticity, and singlet fission potential, we compared the excitation energies and excitation energy ratios of para-substituted Ph.NO with strong EDG and EWG groups, respectively. NICS(1)zz calculations show that all the species listed in Fig. 9 are aromatic in both the S0 and T1 states. DFT calculations show that para-EDG-substituted Ph.NO (p-O and p-NH2) has relatively higher excitation energy with E(T1)a values of 1.17 and 0.75 eV, and E(S1)v values of 1.78 and 1.31 eV, respectively, in comparison with the excitation energies E(T1)a (0.63 eV) and E(S1)v (1.17 eV) of non-substituted Ph.NO. In contrast, the excitation energies of para-EWG-substituted Ph.NO (p-CN and p-NO2) decreases lightly relative to non-substituted Ph.NO with E(T1)a values of 0.55 and 0.53 eV, and E(S1)v values of 1.12 and 1.10 eV, respectively. In addition, the changes in the excitation energy ratios show opposite trends, with relatively high excitation energy ratios for para-EWG-substituted Ph.NO, satisfying the singlet fission thermodynamic requirements with E(S1)v/E(T1)a ratios of 2.04 (p-CN) and 2.08 (p-NO2), and E(T2)v/E(T1)a ratios of 6.02 (p-CN) and 5.77 (p-NO2), respectively. Thus, the substituents have a significant effect on the excitation energy and excitation energy ratios. In this case, the para-EWG-substituted Ph.NO is aromatic in both S0 and T1 states and helps achieve the two thermodynamic requirements for the singlet fission process.

Boron-containing heterocycles have the potential to be used in optoelectronics and sensor materials and have gained extensive attention from experimentalists and theoreticians.78,79 In this section, we tried to investigate the relationship between the adaptive aromaticity and singlet fission potential of boron-containing heterocycles. For the 4π-electron compound 1,2-diborin, boron acts as an electron-deficient atom to provide a vacant p orbital in the π-conjugated system. Note that the 6π-electron compound 1,2-diborin·dianion is generated after the two-electron reduction, and the NICS(1)zz calculation suggests that it is aromatic in the S0 state (−21.5 ppm) and non-aromatic in the T1 state (−4.5 ppm) as the electron excitation mode is from out-of-plane to in-plane. As a 6π-electron compound, the excitation energy ratios of E(S1)v/E(T1)a and E(T2)v/E(T1)a for 1,2-diborin·dianion are both lower than 2, which suggests no singlet fission potential. In addition, we noticed that boraphosphene B2P2 (simplified model) was synthesized by the Cowley group in 198680 and has two BP bonds, the NICS(1)zz calculations show that it is non-aromatic in the S0 (1.7 ppm) and T1 (−9.3 ppm) states. As shown in Fig. 10, compound B2P2 has a relatively high E(T1)a value (2.18 eV) due to the non-aromaticity of its S0 state, resulting in relatively low excitation energy ratios of E(S1)v/E(T1)a, 1.72 and E(T2)v/E(T1)a, 1.91. Moreover, some species with adaptive σ-aromaticity have been reported in recent years. Compared with π-aromaticity, σ-aromaticity generally exists in metal clusters and some saturated systems.81–86 In 2015, the first species with σ-aromaticity dominated in the unsaturated system was reported.87 Later, tetraatomic boron species and compounds with σ-aromaticity in metallacycles were reported by experimentalists88,89 and theoreticians.72,74,90,91 Recently, our group used various aromaticity indices to prove that σ-aromaticity not only plays a key role in the ground-state of species containing a metallacyclopropene74 or B4 unit72 but also stabilizes the T1 state. The origin of these compounds with adaptive σ-aromaticity is due to the excitation mode of π → π* from the S0 to T1 state, which has an ignorable effect on the σ-system and preserves the σ-aromaticity in the T1 state. Interestingly, DFT calculations show that most species containing B4 units with adaptive aromaticity satisfy the thermodynamic requirements of the singlet fission process in principle. For example, the excitation ratios of E(S1)v/E(T1)a and E(T2)v/E(T1)a for compound TB1-S are 2.14 and 1.93, respectively. Other examples are listed in Fig S1,† suggesting the singlet fission potential.

3 Conclusions
In general, Hückel aromaticity (such as in benzene) leads to relatively high values of E(T1)a, E(S1)v, and E(T2)v. Thus, the values of E(S1)v/E(T1)a and E(T2)v/E(T1)a are smaller than 2 in most cases. In contrast, the E(T1)a values for Baird aromatics (such as pentalene) are too low. Although Baird aromatics satisfy the thermodynamic requirements for singlet fission, the relatively high excitation energy ratios result in heat losses. In this work, we explored the relationship between adaptive aromaticity and singlet fission potential via theoretical calculations and found that species with adaptive aromaticity have moderate values of E(T1)a, E(S1)v, and E(T2)v, with excitation energy ratios of E(S1)v/E(T1)a and E(T2)v/E(T1)a close to 2 because in most adaptive aromatics, the aromaticity in the T1 state is not that strong as the Baird aromatics. Our findings in this work demonstrate that the concept of adaptive aromaticity could provide an alternative strategy for experimentalists and theoreticians to design singlet fission materials, because species with adaptive aromaticity not only satisfy the thermodynamic requirements for singlet fission but also reduce the heat loss of the singlet fission process when compared to those with Baird aromaticity.

The model complexes were taken from previously reported species with adaptive aromaticity.59,69,71,72,74,77 We adopted the calculation method proposed by Zeng, Hoffmann, and Ananth (denoted as the ZHA method),29 which was also used in Ottosson's work.58 In the ZHA method, the vertical excitation energy E(S1)v and E(T2)v were based on the optimized geometries of the S0 and T1 states, respectively. For the T1 state, the adiabatic excitation energy E(T1)a was used because it is close to the experimental value.58 For metallic chromophores, the geometries were optimized at the (U)PBE0-D3BJ/6-31G(d)∼LANL2DZ level69,92–96 using the Gaussian 09 software package,97 with 6-31G(d) for C, H, and O atoms while the LANL2DZ was used for P, Os, F, Cl, Br, I, and Sn atoms with the polarization functions.98,99 For organic chromophores, the geometries were optimized at the (U)M06-2X/def2-TZVP level100,101 for cyclic[10]carbon and substituted benzenes, and we used the (U)M06-2X/def2-SVP level for the tetraatomic boron species and boron-containing heterocycles to reduce the computational cost. The vertical excitation energy at the TD-B3LYP/def2-TZVP level69 for metallic chromophores and at the TD-M06-2X/def2-TZVP level for organic chromophores. The spin–orbit coupling calculations were performed using Gaussian 09 in the PySOC (http://sobereva.com/soft/sob_PySOC_MolSOC.zip) software102–104 using S0-geometries. The def2-TZVP was used for the multiple diradical character calculation (PUHF method).105 NICS calculations were performed at the B3LYP-GIAO/def2-TZVP level for metallic chromophores, and at the M06-2X-GIAO/def2-TZVP level for organic chromophores based on the optimized geometries of the S0 and T1 states, respectively. ACID calculations were performed at the B3LYP-CSGT/def2-TZVP level for metallic chromophores based on the optimized geometries. PIO analysis (http://github.com/jxzhangcc/PIO) was combined with NBO 6.0.106 The spin densities were performed with Multiwfn104 and visualized using the VMD program.107

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  NICS(1)zz grids (a) for compound 16.Os.Cl in the S0 and T1 states; ACID plot (b, isovalue: 0.03 a.u.) and spin density (c, isovalue: 0.001 a.u.) for compound 16.Os.Cl in the T1 states.	 

 	Fig. 2  NICS(1)zz values (unit: ppm) in the S0 (black) and T1 (blue) states, excitation energies and excitation energy ratios of cyclics at the TD-B3LYP/def2-TZVP//(U)PBE0-D3BJ/6-31G(d)∼LANL2DZ level. The blue block suggests aromaticity, the red block suggests anti-aromaticity, and the yellow block suggests non-aromaticity, respectively.	 

 	Fig. 3  Biorthogonalized molecular orbitals (isovalue: 0.035 a.u.) of 16.Os.Cl in the S0 and T1 states.	 

 	Fig. 4  HOMO and PIO analysis for 16.Os.X (X = F, Cl, Br, I) in the S0 state including the top two PIO pairs, populations (Pop), PBI (PIO-based bond index), and its contribution (%) of each fragment.	 

 	Fig. 5  Excitation energies (unit: eV), excitation energy ratios and NICS(1)zz values (unit: ppm) of 16.Os.X (X = F, Cl, Br, I). The blue block suggests aromaticity.	 

 	Fig. 6  Total interactions by PIO analysis, excitation energy ratios and NICS(1)zz values (unit: ppm) of 16.M.X. The blue block suggests aromaticity.	 

 	Fig. 7  Excitation energy ratios, spin density (isovalue: 0.001 a.u.), and NICS(1)zz values (unit: ppm) of substituted benzenes.	 

 	Fig. 8  Biorthogonalized molecular orbitals (isovalue: 0.05 a.u.), orbital composition analysis (Mulliken method), and excitation energies (unit: eV) of Ph.NO.	 

 	Fig. 9  Excitation energies (unit: eV), excitation energy ratios and NICS(1)zz values (unit: ppm) of substituted Ph.NO. The blue block suggests aromaticity.	 

 	Fig. 10  Excitation energies (unit: eV), excitation energy ratios and NICS(1)zz values (unit: ppm) of 1,2-diborin·dianion and B2P2, NICS(0)zz values of compound TB1-S. The blue block suggests aromaticity, while the yellow block suggests non-aromaticity.
