    , Accepted 11th April 2019First published on 11th April 2019AbstractHybrid organic–inorganic metal halide perovskites are currently arousing enthusiasm and stimulating huge activity across several fields of optoelectronics due to their outstanding properties. In this study, we present the incoherent random lasing (RL) emissions from CH3NH3PbBr3 perovskite thin films on both planar fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrates and patterned sapphire substrates (PSSs). A detailed examination of the spectral evolution indicates that inelastic exciton–exciton scattering called P-emission is the most plausible mechanism accounting for the lasing emissions. The RL threshold of the perovskite films on PSSs is found to be effectively reduced by more than one order of magnitude from 2.55 to 0.15 μJ per pulse compared to that on FTO substrates. The giant threshold reduction is ascribed to the enhanced random scattering of light and the photon recycling induced by the multireflection processes at the perovskite/PSS interface, which increases the likelihood that the inoperative random rays will re-enter the possible optical loops formed among the perovskite particles, resulting in considerable optical resonance enhancement. The simulation results reveal that the light extraction efficiency on the top facet of the perovskites is significantly increased by approximately 155% by utilizing the PSS instead of the FTO substrate. Moreover, the first direct experimental observation of the multireflection phenomenon of light, as well as the dynamic processes of photon propagation in the composite PSS structure, is presented by Kerr-gate-based time-resolved photoluminescence. Our results provide an effective strategy to achieve high-performance perovskite random lasers and novel light-emitting devices for speckle-free full-field imaging and solid-state lighting applications, by introducing ingeniously designed periodic nano-/microscale optical structures.
Introduction
Hybrid lead halide perovskites (MPbX3, where M = CH3NH3 or Cs, and X = Cl, Br, I, or their mixture systems) have recently emerged as one of the most promising thin-film photovoltaic materials owing to their strong absorption coefficients, long carrier lifetime and diffusion length, large and balanced electron and hole mobility, and low defect density.1–4 Within the past few years, the power conversion efficiency of perovskite solar cells has skyrocketed from 3.8% to the present certified record of 24.2%, which approaches the theoretical efficiency limit.5 Moreover, it has been demonstrated that hybrid perovskites exhibit exceptional photoluminescence efficiency, high color purity, weak Auger recombination, and a wide range of wavelength tunability over the visible spectrum, making them ideal emitter materials for light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and lasing devices.6–9 Very recently, Cao et al.10 and Lin et al.11 independently developed perovskite LEDs that surpass the quantum efficiency milestone of 20%, representing a substantial step towards the practical application of perovskite LEDs in lighting and display. In addition, nonlinear emission characteristics, including amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) and/or lasing, have been extensively investigated in perovskite single crystals,12 thin films,13,14 micro-/nanowires,15,16 and nanocrystals.17,18 Apart from that, random lasing (RL) actions, which are widely explored in closely packed semiconducting quantum dots (CdSe/CdS core–shell)19 and ZnO powders,20,21 have also been observed in the micro-/nanostructured halide perovskite films by several groups.22–27
Unlike conventional lasers, where the gain medium is inside a mirror-based cavity, optical feedback in random lasers occurs due to multiple light scattering in disordered amplifying media.28 Depending on whether the feedback supplied by scattering is intensity feedback or amplitude feedback, random lasers are classified into two categories:29,30 coherent or incoherent feedback random lasers. The question of coherent versus incoherent feedback from scattering media has been clarified29,31 as well as the photon statistics.30 Generally, coherent random lasers with coherent feedback exhibit a typical spiky spectrum while incoherent random lasers with incoherent feedback exhibit a smooth spectrum. In our recent work, the incoherent RL with ultrashort picosecond pulse width has been demonstrated in organometallic halide CH3NH3PbBr3 films under one-, two- and three-photon excitations.23 The RL spectra show no spikes or so-called laser modes due to the large scattering mean free path among the CH3NH3PbBr3 particles, indicating that the light propagation is diffusive and interference contributes negligibly to the feedback process.32 Actually, such incoherent random lasers are well suited for a host of full-field imaging applications from full-field microscopy33,34 to digital light projector systems,35 by providing intense laser illumination without the drawback of coherent artefacts such as speckle that corrupt image formation. However, up to now, research on the incoherent RL in the hybrid lead halide perovskites is still rare, but of significant importance for the great potential in imaging applications.
In this study, high-quality CH3NH3PbBr3 perovskite thin films were synthesized on both planar fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrates and patterned sapphire substrates (PSSs) with periodic cone-shaped patterns, which are widely used in GaN-based LEDs to improve the crystal quality and enhance the light extraction efficiency (LEE).36–38 It is found that the RL threshold of the perovskite films on PSSs is effectively reduced by more than one order of magnitude from 2.55 to 0.15 μJ per pulse compared to that on FTO substrates. The giant threshold reduction is attributed to the enhanced random scattering of light and the photon recycling induced by the multireflection processes at the perovskite/PSS interface. In other words, the light in the CH3NH3PbBr3 films on PSSs has a higher chance for the inoperative random rays to re-enter the possible optical loops formed among the perovskite particles, which results in considerable optical resonance enhancement and hence a lower lasing threshold. Our theoretical simulations based on a finite difference time domain (FDTD) method reveal that the luminous flux from the top facet of the perovskite films is increased by approximately 155% using the PSSs instead of the FTO substrates, indicating that the PSS can redirect photons that were originally emitted out of the escape cone back into the escape cone on top of the perovskite surfaces. Furthermore, the multireflection phenomenon of light was directly observed, for the first time, within the perovskite/PSS structure via the Kerr-gate-based time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) experiments. The inelastic exciton–exciton scattering called P-emission is considered to be the most plausible mechanism accounting for the red shift of the lasing line and the spectral broadening with increasing excitation intensities above the threshold, as well as the ultra-short decay time of <4 ps of the lasing pulses. From the energy difference between the P-emission and the free exciton luminescence, we can estimate the exciton binding energy to be 20–40 meV, which is in good agreement with the results of recent absorption studies for CH3NH3PbBr3 single crystals and polycrystalline films.39–41 These results provide an effective strategy to obtain high-efficiency perovskite random lasers and novel light-emitting devices by introducing ingeniously designed periodic nano-/microscale structures, including patterned substrates, photonic crystals, grating structures, microlens arrays, and self-assembled patterning.
Experimental section
Synthesis of CH3NH3PbBr3 thin films
CH3NH3PbBr3 films were synthesized as described in our recent report.23 Typically, CH3NH3Br (MABr) was first synthesized by reacting methylamine (CH3NH3, 33 wt% ethanol solution, Aldrich) and hydrobromic acid (HBr, 47 wt% in water, Aldrich) with a stoichiometric ratio of 1:1 in an ice bath for 3 hours with stirring, followed by vacuum drying at a temperature of 60 °C for 24 hours. Then, CH3NH3PbBr3 precursor solutions were prepared by mixing equimolar CH3NH3Br (1.4 g) and lead bromide (PbBr2, 4.6 g) powders in N,N′-dimethylformamide (DMF) solutions (10 mL) at a temperature of 70 °C for 4 hours. After that, CH3NH3PbBr3 precursor solutions were spin-coated onto the PSSs and transparent conducting FTO glass substrates at 4000 rpm for 15 seconds. Upon drying at a temperature of 100 °C for 10 minutes, the coated films darkened in color, indicating the formation of CH3NH3PbBr3 perovskite films in the solid state on both substrates, which is confirmed using X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements at room temperature. The average thickness of the CH3NH3PbBr3 films was measured to be about 5 μm.
Characterization
The surface-textured morphology of the CH3NH3PbBr3 films was characterized by a high-resolution scanning electron microscope (SEM, XL30FEG, Philips, the Netherlands). The optical absorption spectroscopy of the synthesized samples was carried out using a UV–Vis–NIR spectrophotometer (Cary 5000, Varian, America) with an integrating sphere attachment in the range of 300 to 1000 nm. The XRD pattern of the samples was recorded on an X-ray diffraction spectrometer (Cu Kα, D8-Avance, BrukerAXS, Germany).
Optical measurements
The PL experiments were performed at room temperature (20 °C) by femtosecond (fs) impulsive optical excitation at 400 nm. The 400 nm pulses were generated by frequency doubling the 800 nm fs pulses, which were emitted from a mode-locked Ti:sapphire regenerative amplifier system (Verdi G8, Coherent, America) operating at a 35 fs pulse duration and 1 kHz repetition rate, via a phase-matching β-BaB2O4 (BBO) crystal. The excitation beam was introduced into the confocal system, and focused to a spot of 300 μm in diameter through an optical lens with a focal length of 8 cm. The RL behaviors of the perovskite films and the multireflection phenomenon within the perovskite/PSS structure were identified by a Kerr-gate-based TRPL system with a temporal resolution of about 100 fs. In the TRPL system, the fundamental beams (800 nm) from the regenerative amplifier were divided into two beams at a beam splitter: one is used as the excitation pulse of the sample after the second harmonic generation (400 nm) at a phase-matching BBO crystal and the other as the gating laser pulse to rotate the polarization of luminescence at a Kerr medium. The luminescence signals were dispersed by a triple-grating spectrometer (Shamrock SR-303, Andor) and were recorded by a cooled charge-coupled device (CCD) camera.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1(a)–(c) present top-view SEM images that show the morphology of the synthesized perovskite microstructures on the planar FTO substrate and the PSS with cone-shaped patterns. These patterns were fabricated by inductively coupled plasma (ICP) etching with their height (h), diameter (d), and spacing (s) being 1.9, 2.9, and 0.26 μm, respectively. We can clearly see the typical crystalline grains of the CH3NH3PbBr3 films with dimensions ranging from several hundred nanometers to a few micrometers, as well as the high-density irregular pinholes in all the samples. However, the films on the PSSs show larger pinholes compared to those on the FTO substrates, indicating their lower surface coverage of the perovskite particles, which is considered to be plausible because the film morphology is highly sensitive to the surface properties of the underlying substrates.42Fig. 1(d) shows the UV–visible absorption and the normalized spontaneous emission (SE) spectra of the CH3NH3PbBr3 films. Absorption onset occurs at about 547 nm and the nonzero baseline is attributed to the light scattering and interference effect.43 Note that the absorption signal for the PSS samples was too weak and is not presented here due to the significantly enhanced random scattering resulting from the periodic micropatterns at the perovskite/PSS interface. An identifiable peak blue shift of the SE spectra is exhibited from ∼545 to ∼535 nm, showing a better color purity of green emission for the PSS samples. Such variation between the emission spectra exists in not only CH3NH3PbBr33,44 but also CH3NH3PbI3,45,46 and is still confusing, despite the tremendous efforts that have been made. Generally, a shift in the emission can originate from the strain, defect, or fluctuation of the material composition. Besides, the difference of the optical band gap between the surface and the bulk of the hybrid organic–inorganic perovskites has been recently suggested to interpret the observations performed by one- and two-photon excitation.47,48 In our case, a possible mechanism for the spectral shift is that the patterned substrate gives rise to changes in the defect-related surface states/traps of the CH3NH3PbBr3 film and hence the carrier relaxation pathway.49,50 Then the disparity between the SE spectra can be plausibly understood in terms of the recombination of localized excitons or free excitons trapped at surface states. That is, the interaction of excitons with the varied surface states/traps brings about the conversion of the recombination pathway from dominant localized exciton recombination to dominant free exciton recombination,51,52 which ultimately results in the blue-shift of the emission maximum. The inset in Fig. 1(d) illustrates the cubic perovskite structure of the investigated CH3NH3PbBr3 films that was confirmed by the XRD pattern, as shown in Fig. 1(e). All the sharp diffraction peaks of the products can be easily indexed, and the lattice constant is accordingly calculated to be ∼5.98 Å, consistent with the previously reported value.3

Fig. 2(a) and (d) show the excitation-power-dependent PL spectra of the CH3NH3PbBr3 thin films on the FTO substrate and the PSS, respectively. A clear transition from SE to RL is observed when the excitation intensity exceeds a threshold for both cases. Since there were no specifically defined laser cavities in these perovskite films, the optical feedback for lasing could be formed via multiple random scattering provided by the polycrystalline grain boundaries and/or the irregular pinholes.24 Here, it should be noted that the RL spectra in our scenarios presented no spikes at varied excitation intensities, signifying the incoherent RL emission, where the interference contributes negligible feedback. This also indicates that the light propagation is diffusive due to the large scattering mean free path among the CH3NH3PbBr3 particles.23,32 As shown in Fig. 2(b) and (e), clear signatures of the RL, including abrupt narrowing of the spectral linewidth (see the insets) and threshold behavior with a steep rise in emission intensity above the threshold, can be readily obtained. The thresholds are derived to be 2.55 and 0.15 μJ per pulse for FTO and PSS samples, respectively. Concerning the PSS/FTO case, when the excitation intensity was lower than the threshold, a broad SE spectrum was observed with a peak wavelength of ∼535/545 nm and a full width at half-maximum (FWHM) of ∼25/23 nm. With increasing excitation intensity, a distinguishable RL was generated at 547/548 nm when the excitation intensity reached the threshold. As the excitation intensity was further increased, the peak wavelength gradually red shifted to 550/551 nm, concomitant with a remarkable increase in emission intensity and a sudden decrease in spectral linewidth, as shown in the insets of Fig. 2(b) and (e). Moreover, a slight broadening of the RL bandwidth above the threshold with elevated excitation intensities was exhibited. Similar spectral broadening has been observed previously by Zhang et al.53 in organometal halide CH3NH3PbBr3 perovskite cubic microcrystals. Fig. 2(c) and (f) show the fitting of the PL spectra at excitation intensities above the thresholds (5.02 and 0.48 μJ per pulse) for the FTO and PSS samples, respectively. The spectra were well fitted by two Gaussian peaks, corresponding to the broad SE and the narrow RL emission, respectively. The emission intensities were replotted in the insets of Fig. 2(c) and (f) as a function of excitation intensity on a log–log scale, exhibiting the typical “S-shaped” L–I characteristic of a laser. In the yellow-shaded regions, the light transited from SE to lasing.

The insets plot the corresponding FWHM and peak position of the emission spectra versus excitation intensity.

The cumulative fits are indicated by the pink solid lines. The insets show the replotted emission intensities versus excitation intensity on a log–log scale. The solid red lines are the theoretical fitting curves. The “S-shaped” L–I curve shows a standard lasing evolution process including the SE region, ASE region, and lasing region. In the yellow-shaded regions, the light transited from SE to lasing. 
Considering the possible gain mechanism physically, we assign the RL emission at the lower side of the SE (or free exciton resonance) peak as a result of the inelastic exciton–exciton scattering process called “P-emission”, which has also been observed by H. Kunugita et al.54 in perovskite CH3NH3PbBr3 single crystal. In this scattering process, an exciton is scattered into a higher exciton state (n = 2, 3, …, ∞), while another one, known as the exciton–photon complex or polariton, leaves a part of its energy as a “luminescence” photon with respect to the conservation of energy and momentum rules.55 As shown in Fig. 2, the energy differences between the free exciton resonance and the P-emission are 21 and 27 meV, respectively, for the FTO and PSS samples. This difference corresponds to the transition energy from the n = 1 exciton state to the n = 2 or higher exciton states. The energy of the nth exciton is given by Eg − (Eb/n2), where Eg and Eb are the band gap and exciton binding energy, respectively. Therefore the respective exciton binding energies for the FTO and PSS samples can be estimated to be 21–28 and 27–36 meV (namely 20–40 meV), respectively, which are similar to the results of recent studies.39–41 Moreover, the red shift of the lasing line as well as the spectral broadening with increasing excitation intensities above the threshold are in good agreement with the inelastic exciton–exciton scattering model, which have been widely explored in ZnSe epilayers56 and CdS materials.57
It is worth noting that, in contrast to the FTO sample, the PSS counterpart presents an effective reduction of RL threshold by more than one order of magnitude from 2.55 to 0.15 μJ per pulse. This giant threshold reduction is believed to result from the enhanced random scattering of light and the photon recycling58 induced by the multireflection processes at the perovskite/PSS interface, as shown in Fig. 3(a). For simplicity, we assume that the CH3NH3PbBr3 film on the PSS is flat with a smooth surface as an ideal scenario. Because of the great disparity in refractive index between perovskite (n = 2.55)59 and air (n = 1), as well as perovskite and sapphire (n = 1.78), the critical angles for light to escape from the perovskite into the air and sapphire are only 23.1° and 44.3°, respectively, according to Snell's law. Hence, a large proportion of the rays are confined in the perovskite films. The patterns at the perovskite/PSS interface could modify the light path and, ultimately, break the total reflection effect. Consequently, rays are repeatedly scattered by pattern units on the PSS. Since a proportion of these random rays have chance to re-enter the possible closed optical loops formed among the perovskite particles (schematically depicted in Fig. 3(b)), or so-called photon recycling, the optical resonance induced by the random scattering should be enhanced due to the multireflection processes. As a result, the RL threshold of the CH3NH3PbBr3 perovskite films is effectively decreased by utilizing the PSS instead of the planar FTO substrate.

The theoretical simulations of both FTO and PSS scenarios were developed using an FDTD method based on a three-dimensional (3D) geometrical ray-tracing approach60,61 to improve our understanding of the enhanced scattering effect in the perovskite/PSS structure. The schematic diagram of the simulation model for the PSS (FTO) structure is shown in Fig. 4 and it is 200 × 200 μm2 in size, which consists of a 5 μm-thick CH3NH3PbBr3 perovskite film and a 50 μm-thick PSS (FTO) substrate. The arrangement of the periodic patterns is conical with the structural parameters illustrated in Fig. 3(a). In the simulations, light rays emit from a disc-shaped Lamberian source located at the center of the perovskite top facet with 100 μm diameter and 300 nm thickness, which approximately equals the penetration depth of the 400 nm pumping light. The center wavelength of the source is 545 nm. The propagation of the rays within the whole composite structure is treated geometrically according to Fresnel equations. Fig. 5 shows the intensity distributions of the luminous flux from the top facet of the perovskite films for the FTO and PSS models, respectively. The respective LEEs were calculated to be about 11% and 28%. In other words, the LEE on the top facet of the perovskite films is significantly increased by approximately 155% using the PSS instead of the FTO substrate due to the enhanced random scattering of the light at the perovskite/PSS interface, demonstrating that the PSS can effectively redirect photons that were originally emitted out of the escape cone back into the escape cone on the top of the perovskite surfaces, as illustrated in Fig. 3(a). Such a deliberately introduced modification of the light path by the PSS increases the chance for inoperative random rays to re-enter the optical loops formed among the perovskite particles (Fig. 3(b)), resulting in considerable optical resonance enhancement. The point to emphasize here is that by changing the structural parameters of patterns and the relevant ICP processes, it is feasible to obtain other special optimized patterns, such as stripe, hemisphere, pyramid, and concave, to further reduce the RL threshold. In addition, various nanofabrication technologies,62 including nanoimprint lithography (NIL), nanosphere lithography, electron beam lithography, and laser interference lithography (LIL), have also been proposed to fabricate the nanoscale patterns instead of the micro-counterparts.

The intensities are normalized by the maximum value obtained in the PSS simulations. The respective LEEs on the top facet were calculated to be about 11% and 28%. 
To confirm the RL behavior and gain additional insight into the dynamic processes of photon propagation in the perovskite/PSS structure, TRPL experiments were carried out for both cases using an optical Kerr-gate method.63,64Fig. 6(a) and (c) show the time- and spectral-resolved images of the output pulses at an excitation intensity of twice the threshold value for the FTO and PSS samples, respectively. The corresponding spectrally integrated waveforms of the pulses are respectively given in Fig. 6(b) and (d), together with the well-fitting curves. Concerning the FTO case, a narrow emission centered at ∼551 nm is presented with an ultrashort pulse width of 3.1 ps extracted from the fitting curve, featuring ultrafast lasing action with typical gain-switching characteristics, which has been unambiguously identified and discussed in detail in our recent work.23 Nevertheless, for the PSS scenario, two additional successive emission outputs were distinctly observed apart from the initial 2.5 ps ultrashort RL pulse, namely multiemission processes. Such an anomalous multiemission phenomenon should be associated with the unique periodic patterns on the PSS, and is believed to be caused by the multireflection processes within the perovskite/PSS structure. To our knowledge, this is the first direct observation of the multireflection phenomenon of light in the composite PSS structure via an experimental method, although various kinds of PSSs with different geometric parameters have been extensively studied both theoretically65,66 and experimentally,66,67 and are already being commercially applied for high-efficiency GaN-based LEDs. The ultrashort decay time of <4 ps is comparable to the decay time observed previously for the excitonic lasing in ZnO microcrystals at room temperature,68 which further indicates that the sharp peak at the lower energy side of the exciton resonance probably comes from inelastic exciton–exciton scattering. This excitonic scattering process provides high-enough gain during the ultrashort pumping duration and results in a population inversion, and hence, lasing emission. Actually, it is a big challenge even for high-performance semiconductor lasers to obtain ps pulses. As to an ASE process with similar spectral evolution, it is plausibly considered to be too difficult to achieve such ultrashort ps pulses. It is also important to note that the initial 2.5 ps pulse width is, to date, the shortest one that has been demonstrated in organometallic bromide perovskite random lasers, showing the considerable potential of halide perovskites for application in ultrafast lasing devices. Conclusively, our results provide an effective strategy to obtain high-performance perovskite random lasers and light-emitting devices by utilizing ingeniously designed periodic nano-/microscale structures, such as patterned substrates, photonic crystal structures, microlens arrays, grating structures, and self-assembled patterning.

Conclusions
In summary, high-quality CH3NH3PbBr3 perovskite thin films were synthesized on both planar FTO substrates and PSSs with cone-shaped patterns. With femtosecond optical pumping at 400 nm, the incoherent RL threshold of the perovskite films on PSSs is found to be effectively reduced by more than one order of magnitude from 2.55 to 0.15 μJ per pulse compared to that on FTO substrates. The giant threshold reduction is ascribed to the enhanced random scattering of light and the photon recycling induced by the multireflection processes at the perovskite/PSS interface. Our theoretical simulations based on a FDTD method indicate that the PSS can redirect photons that were originally emitted out of the escape cone back into the escape cone on the top of the perovskite surfaces. The deliberately introduced modification of the light path by the PSS makes it more probable for the inoperative random rays to re-enter the possible closed optical loops formed among the perovskite particles and thus results in the considerable optical resonance enhancement, which contributes to the low RL threshold. Moreover, the ultrashort output pulses and the dynamic processes of photon propagation in the perovskite/PSS structure were explored by Kerr-gate-based TRPL measurements. Two additional successive emission outputs were distinctly observed apart from the initial 2.5 ps ultrashort RL pulse. This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first direct experimental observation of the multireflection phenomenon of light in the composite PSS structure. The spectral evolution with increasing excitation intensity and the ultra-short decay time of <4 ps of the lasing pulses are reasonably explained based on the inelastic exciton–exciton scattering (P-emission) mechanism. The estimated exciton binding energy of 20–40 meV in our CH3NH3PbBr3 films is in good agreement with those reported in CH3NH3PbBr3 single crystals and polycrystalline films. These results would be expected to pave the way for high-performance perovskite random lasers and novel light-emitting devices for speckle-free full-field imaging and solid-state lighting applications, by ingeniously designing the periodic nano-/microscale optical structures.

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  Top-view SEM images of the CH3NH3PbBr3 perovskite thin films on the planar FTO substrate (a) and the PSS with cone-shaped patterns (b and c), respectively. (d) UV–visible absorption spectrum and normalized SE spectra of the CH3NH3PbBr3 films on the FTO substrate and PSS, respectively. The inset shows the cubic perovskite structure of the investigated CH3NH3PbBr3 films that is confirmed by the XRD measurements. (e) The XRD pattern of the CH3NH3PbBr3 films. Two main diffraction peaks at 14.92° and 30.12° represent the different crystallographic planes of (100) and (200), respectively.	 

 	Fig. 2  (a and d) Evolutions of emission spectra with increasing excitation intensity for the FTO and PSS samples, respectively. (b and e) Excitation-intensity dependences of the emission intensity showing threshold behaviors for the FTO and PSS samples, respectively. The insets plot the corresponding FWHM and peak position of the emission spectra versus excitation intensity. (c and f) PL spectra at excitation intensities above the thresholds (5.02 and 0.48 μJ per pulse) fitted with two Gaussian peaks: peak I (SE, olive short-dashed lines), and peak II (RL, blue short-dashed lines), for the FTO and PSS samples, respectively. The cumulative fits are indicated by the pink solid lines. The insets show the replotted emission intensities versus excitation intensity on a log–log scale. The solid red lines are the theoretical fitting curves. The “S-shaped” L–I curve shows a standard lasing evolution process including the SE region, ASE region, and lasing region. In the yellow-shaded regions, the light transited from SE to lasing.	 

 	Fig. 3  (a) Two-dimensional scheme of the light path within the perovskite/PSS structure. The blue arrows represent the light propagation in the CH3NH3PbBr3 perovskite film. The structural parameters of the patterns can be extracted from the SEM images. (b) Schematic diagram of possible optical loops (yellow arrows) formed among the perovskite particles in the CH3NH3PbBr3 films due to the random scattering processes.	 

 	Fig. 4  Schematic diagram of the PSS model for three-dimensional geometrical ray tracing simulations. The periodic patterns are conical with the height (h), diameter (d), and spacing (s) being 1.9, 2.9, and 0.26 μm, respectively.	 

 	Fig. 5  Three-dimensional intensity distributions of the luminous flux from the top facet of the perovskite films for the FTO (a) and PSS (b) models, respectively. The intensities are normalized by the maximum value obtained in the PSS simulations. The respective LEEs on the top facet were calculated to be about 11% and 28%.	 

 	Fig. 6  TRPL images of the RL emission from the CH3NH3PbBr3 perovskite films at the excitation intensity of 2Eth for the FTO (a) and PSS (c) samples, respectively. The multiemission phenomenon was clearly observed for the PSS scenario. Corresponding spectrally integrated waveforms of the emission pulses from the CH3NH3PbBr3 films on the FTO substrate (b) and PSS (d), respectively. The solid lines show the well-fitting curves of the emission pulses.
