    , Accepted 24th July 2017First published on 25th July 2017AbstractThe reproducibility of high-performance perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) remains a major obstacle. Herein, for the first time, we report the use of 2,6-dimethoxypyridine (2,6-Py) for interface chemistry engineering to fabricate reproducible high-efficiency planar perovskite solar cells. The 2,6-Py serves dual functions: (1) as a Lewis base enabling surface passivation of Lewis acid traps (e.g., under-coordinated Pb ions) without corroding the perovskite; (2) as a chemical dopant for [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) to improve its conductivity and mobility for efficient electron extraction and transport. Thus, through both the surface passivation of the perovskite layer and the doping of the electron transport layer with 2,6-Py, the resultant MAPbI3-based planar solar cells outperform the untreated devices with power conversion efficiency (PCE) significantly improved from 15.53% to 19.41%. The devices with the dual-function treatment yield effectively improved reproducibility with a narrow PCE distribution – that is, around 90% of the devices afford a PCE of over 17.50% (about 90% of the champion PCE), and also display enhanced air stability – that is, they maintain nearly 80% of their initial PCEs after 200 h in ambient air without any encapsulation.
1. Introduction
Solution-processable organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites have currently evolved as a revolutionary material system promising for versatile optoelectronic applications,1–4 such as solar cells, light-emitting diodes, photodetectors, etc. Perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) have rapidly achieved a competitive performance level with a certified PCE value of over 22%,5–9 which is approaching that of commercial inorganic solar cells. However, the issue of poor reproducibility of high-performance PVSCs remains a major obstacle. Besides the crystal growth of perovskite films via solution processing and the fabrication atmosphere,10–12 the difficulty of controlling trap states on the perovskite surface could be another reason for the reproducibility issue. The trap states lead to charge recombination and deteriorate the device performance. One important origin of such surface defects is the under-coordinated ions (including the halide ions and the metal ions) that have been confirmed by both theoretical and experimental investigations,13–15 and also observed for other ionic semiconductors (e.g., GaAs).16 During the annealing process (especially long-term and high-temperature annealing) of MAPbI3 films, the halide and/or organic ions can be partially lost from the crystal mainly due to the low thermal stability of MAPbI3, thereby resulting in under-coordinated Pb atoms with a net positive charge at the crystal surface.17,18 Additionally, the under-coordinated ions (e.g., the metal ions) in the perovskite would be unstable when exposed to air and/or moisture,19 which is also adverse to device reproducibility and long-term stability.
One plausible solution to efficiently passivate those surface trap states is adopting interface chemistry engineering. The chemical activity of ions (e.g., Pb2+ and I−) of perovskites makes it easy to form various chemical interactions with different functional groups (e.g., –OH, –NH2, and –CN).20–23 In this regard, the Snaith group17 pioneered the demonstration of passivation of under-coordinated Pb2+ using Lewis bases thiophene and pyridine. They claimed that the sulfur atoms or nitrogen atoms in such electron-rich molecules could donate their lone electron pairs to the Lewis acid Pb and form Lewis adducts via coordinate (dative covalent) bonding. The Lewis base-passivated perovskites exhibited a longer carrier lifetime and showed increased device efficiencies and reproducibility. However, in the case where the Lewis base is a strong base like pyridine and 4-tert-butyl pyridine (TBP), it would corrode perovskites and form new complexes,24,25 thus inducing harm to the device reproducibility and long-term stability. On the other hand, following this Lewis base passivation concept, conjugated polymers or small molecules with Lewis base-functional groups like alkylamine, carbonyl and cyano groups have been designed to function as both a surface-trap passivation layer for under-coordinated Pb2+ ions and an interfacial charge transport layer.26–28 Thus, simple and effective materials are still desirable to eliminate under-coordinated ion surface traps to achieve highly reproducible and high-efficiency perovskite solar cells.
In this study, we report an initial use of 2,6-dimethoxypyridine (2,6-Py) for dual functions of interface passivation and n-doping to obtain reproducible high-efficiency planar perovskite solar cells. The schematic process of interface engineering is illustrated in Fig. 1a and b. 2,6-Py (chemical structure in Fig. 1a) was chosen as a Lewis base with electron-rich functional groups N and O, which in total possess five lone pairs of electrons. It can interact with the perovskite via coordinate bonding (evidenced by NMR results, Fig. 1c), thus providing accessibility to passivate the Lewis acid trap states of under-coordinated Pb ions. In contrast to the previously reported Lewis base pyridine, 2,6-Py is safer to the perovskite. It doesn't corrode MAPbI3 perovskite films. On the other hand, the electron-donating 2,6-Py is capable of serving as an n-dopant for electron-acceptor PC61BM, leading to an increase in the conductivity by two orders of magnitude up to 10−5 S cm−1 (Fig. 1d). Upon both Lewis base surface passivation and doping of PC61BM with 2,6-Py, we achieved a remarkable improvement in performances with champion PCEs from 15.53% to 19.41%. These PCE values are among the highest values for reported MAPbI3 based planar perovskite solar cells. More strikingly, the treated devices exhibited improved reproducibility with a narrow PCE distribution: around 90% of the 50 treated devices exhibited a PCE of over 17.5% (about 90% of the champion PCE), while only about 30% of the statistical control devices showed a PCE of over 14.0% (about 90% of the champion PCE). Furthermore, the resultant devices also showed increased air stability, that is they maintain nearly 80% of their initial PCEs after 200 h under ambient conditions without any encapsulation, comparing to 60% of their initial PCEs for control devices.

2. Results and discussion
To confirm the chemical interaction between 2,6-Py and the perovskite, we first performed liquid state 1H NMR measurements. The proton NMR spectra of the following three samples are compared in Fig. 1c: deuterated DMF solution with 2,6-Py, with MAPbI3 and with MAPbI3 + 2,6-Py (denoted as treated MAPbI3). Herein, the MAPbI3 is comprised of CH3NH3I and PbI2 with a fixed molar ratio of 1.3:1.3 in 1 mL deuterated DMF. The neat MAPbI3 solution shows two major proton peaks with chemical shifts of 7.96 ppm and 2.72 ppm, which are attributed to the proton signals of the NH3 and CH3 groups, respectively. With the addition of 2,6-Py into the MAPbI3, both the signal peaks of NH3 and CH3 downfield-shifted by 0.12 ppm and 0.10 ppm to 8.08 ppm and 2.82 ppm, respectively, and the peak of NH3 became broader. Meanwhile, all proton signals of the –OCH3 group and aromatic ring of 2,6-Py in the treated MAPbI3 shifted toward upfield when compared to those in the neat 2,6-Py solution. Additionally, the proton ratios (calculated from the area ratio of the integrated intensities of proton peaks) of CH3:NH3 and OCH3:aromatic protons (“7”:“3” + “4 + 5” in Fig. 1c) in the treated MAPbI3 sample are in accordance with those in the neat samples. Thus, the abovementioned proton chemical shifts in the treated MAPbI3 sample give strong evidence of the presence of interaction between 2,6-Py and MAPbI3. Hydrogen bonds between CH3NH2+ and O were previously described to induce the change of chemical shift of NH3.22 However, this phenomenon can be ruled out since its effect on the chemical shift of the proton peak of NH3 is in the opposite direction to the shift we observe here. Generally, the interaction between a Lewis acid and a Lewis base is via coordinate bonding. Therefore, we concluded the chemical interaction between the Lewis base 2,6-Py and MAPbI3 resulted from the coordinate bonding.
To elucidate the passivation effects of 2,6-Py on perovskite surface traps, we performed steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved PL (TRPL) decay experiments on both pristine and treated MAPbI3 films. MAPbI3 films here were prepared using a two-step sequential solution deposition approach (see the Experimental section). The passivation treatment was performed through spin-coating the Lewis base 2,6-Py onto the perovskite surface (Fig. 1a). Compared with the PL spectra of the pristine MAPbI3 film (Fig. 2a), the PL intensity of the 2,6-Py-treated MAPbI3 film is increased twofold. To ensure the accuracy of the comparison, the same MAPbI3 film was used for these measurements with and without 2,6-Py treatment. This means that the increased PL intensity is not related to the crystal quality of the perovskite, but mainly ascribed to the reduced surface traps, which suggests effective suppression of the recombination of free carriers.17,29 As direct evidence of the reduction of charge recombination, the carrier life time determined from single exponential fits to the PL decays is significantly improved from 69.7 ± 2.6 ns for the pristine film to 296.0 ± 3.5 ns for the treated MAPbI3 film (Fig. 2b). Thus, 2,6-Py can effectively passivate the under-coordinated Pb2+ traps as described in Fig. 2c: the nitrogen atom of 2,6-Py can donate its lone pair electrons to the Pb atom and form Lewis adducts, thus passivating the trap states.

(c) Schematic diagram of a Lewis adduct formed from 2,6-Py molecules and the perovskite film via coordinated bonding. (d) XRD patterns of the MAPbI3 films without treatment and treated with pure pyridine (Py) and 2,6-dimethoxypyridine (2,6-Py), respectively. 
It is important to test the chemical stability of the MAPbI3 films during the surface passivation treatment. When pyridine is blended with the MAPbI3 solution, white solid precipitates are formed, which is associated with the formation of PbI2–(pyridine)x. When 2,6-Py is blended with the MAPbI3 solution, the solution remains clear without any precipitation (Fig. S1a†), suggesting that the perovskite is more stable to 2,6-Py passivation. This is also supported by the XRD results of the perovskite films. The main diffraction peaks of the pristine perovskite film were at 14.05°, 28.42°, and 31.82° (Fig. 2d), corresponding to the (110), (220), and (310) diffraction planes of the MAPbI3 phase, respectively. The small diffraction peak at 12.59° is assigned to the (101) peak of PbI2. The residual PbI2 in this two-step process has been demonstrated to effectively passivate the defects at the grain boundaries of the perovskite crystals, thereby benefiting the device performance.18,30,31 After one drop of pure pyridine was spin-coated onto the perovskite film, the dark brown MAPbI3 film immediately turned colorless (the picture is shown in Fig. 2d). The distinguishable white residuals in the resultant film were detected to be the new complex PbI2–(pyridine)x with the diffraction peak at 6.96°, suggesting that the pristine MAPbI3 film is destroyed by the pyridine. However, spin coating the pure 2,6-Py on top of the MAPbI3 film will not change the color of the perovskite film. The XRD spectra are almost identical for the MAPbI3 film before and after the 2,6-Py coating. The top-view SEM images of the perovskite films without and with 2,6-Py treatment are almost very similar (Fig. S1b and c†). These results further indicated the benign stability of the perovskite MAPbI3 to 2,6-Py treatment.
Improving the conductivities of the organic electron transport layer (ETL) is important to enhance charge transport and collection, as it will reduce contact resistance and interfacial recombination loss in devices. Recently, we have found that polyethylenimine (PEI) with the Lewis base group alkylamine can chemically dope the fullerene ETL PC61BM, leading to increased conductivity and solar cell performance.32 Similarly, other organic compounds with Lewis base groups like OH−, F−, AcO− and alkylamino have also been determined as n-type dopants to dope fullerene derivatives via electron transfer.33–38 Here, 2,6-Py is also a Lewis base. It may provide a similar chemical doping effect for PC61BM. To confirm our hypothesis, we then investigated the influence of 2,6-Py on the electrical conductivities of the PC61BM films (Fig. 1d and S2†). The pristine PC61BM film shows a measured low conductivity of 3.6 × 10−7 S cm−1, similar to that reported in the literature. As expected, with the optimized 10 wt% doping of 2,6-Py, the conductivity was improved up to 2.5 × 10−5 S cm−1. The UV-vis-near IR spectra are then used to study the origin of the doping effect of 2,6-Py. As shown in Fig. 3, compared to the absorption spectra of the pristine film, the doped PC61BM film exhibits a new broad absorption band in the spectral range of 750–1200 nm. This low-energy band absorption was reported as characteristic of the organic anion radical PC61BM˙−.39,40 which was also demonstrated as a sharp feature at around 1100 nm in the solution absorption spectra of doped PC61BM (Fig. S3†). These results indicated electron transfer between 2,6-Py and PC61BM.

Efficient charge transport and charge transfer/extraction are critical to device performance. In order to illustrate if the doped PC61BM could contribute to efficient charge transport, we evaluated the electron mobilities of the pristine and doped PC61BM films using the electron-only device of ITO/ZnO/PC61BM or doped PC61BM/Ca/Al, as shown in Fig. S4.† The electron mobility of the doped PC61BM film, estimated by fitting the current–voltage data using the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) model, is increased from 4.5 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 to 3.8 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1. The higher electron mobility may facilitate the charge transfer and reduce charge recombination loss. As shown in Fig. 2a, the MAPbI3 film after being coated with the doped PC61BM film affords stronger PL quenching than the pristine film. This suggests that the doped PC61BM yields higher efficiency of electron extraction from the perovskite layer than the pure PC61BM. When coated with (2,6-Py)/PC61BM:2,6-Py, the perovskite film shows much higher PL quenching efficiency. This indicates that the charge transfer at the (2,6-Py)/PC61BM:2,6-Py–MAPbI3 surface is much more efficient than that at the undoped one. The more efficient charge transfer is presumed as a combination result of the reduced surface traps and improved conductivity and electron mobility. Further proof of this improved charge extraction is the reduced decay time from 2.51 ns for the pure PC61BM-based perovskite to 1.29 ns for MAPbI3(2,6-Py)/PC61BM:2,6-Py via double-exponential decay function fitting (Fig. 2b). Additionally, when coated with (2,6-Py)/PC61BM:2,6-Py, the perovskite film has a more uniform and smooth surface with a lower root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 2.5 nm compared to that of 3.6 nm for the perovskite film with pure PC61BM (Fig. S5†). This observation indicates that both the surface treatment and doping of PC61BM with 2,6-Py can improve the coverage of the PC61BM film onto the perovskite layer. Therefore, the 2,6-Py enables efficient passivation of the undercoordinated-ion surface traps of the perovskite and higher conductivity and electron mobility of the PC61BM.
Planar perovskite solar cells comprising the aforementioned PC61BM as the electron-transport layer (ETL) were fabricated with a configuration of ITO/NiOx/MAPbI3/ETL/PEI/Ag. We first investigated the effect of doped PC61BM at varied doping concentrations. The resultant device data are shown in Fig. S6,† where we identified that the optimal doping ratio was 10 wt% to achieve maximal efficiency that is consistent with the conductivity result. The current–voltage (J–V) curves and photovoltaic properties of PVSCs under each processing condition are displayed in Fig. 4 and Table 1, respectively. The control devices based pristine PC61BM without any treatment can only achieve a champion efficiency of 15.53%, with a VOC of 1.06 V, a JSC of 20.35 mA cm−2, and a FF of 0.72. However, after the facile treatment of the MAPbI3 surface with 2,6-Py, the PCE was dramatically improved up to 18.58%. This efficiency enhancement can be mainly attributed to the increase in both JSC (22.19 mA cm−2) and FF (0.79). As shown in Fig. S7,† the MAPbI3 films without and with 2,6-Py treatment show similar absorption spectra. The 2,6-Py treatment doesn't change the crystal structure and morphology shown in the abovementioned XRD spectra (Fig. 2d) and SEM images (Fig. S1b and c†). Thus, the main contribution to the improved JSC is the reduction of the charge recombination, which can be ascribed to the efficient passivation of the surface traps. The reduced charge recombination loss also yields a higher FF in the 2,6-Py treated devices.5 On the other hand, when 10 wt% 2,6-Py doped PC61BM is deposited on top of the untreated perovskite film as the ETL, the resultant device also yielded an improved PCE of up to 18.28%, with a similar increase in both JSC and FF. Upon the doping of PC61BM with the 2,6-Py, the increased electron mobility (Fig. S4†) and conductivity (Fig. 1d) lead to more efficient electron transport to the electrode. Efficient charge transport can suppress the charge recombination and enhance the charge collection. Therefore, the enhanced JSC and FF can be ascribed to efficient charge transport inside the doped PC61BM. Compared with other typical organic n-type dopants, Lewis base 2,6-Py not only demonstrates to be an effective dopant for fullerenes to improve device performance, but also is low-cost and commercially available without extra complex chemical synthesis. Benefiting from such dual interface engineering, we finally achieved the highest PCE of up to 19.41% for the (2,6-Py)/PC61BM:2,6-Py-based device, with a VOC of 1.09 V, a JSC of 23.14 mA cm−2, and a FF of 0.77. Fig. 5a shows that the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the (2,6-Py)/PC61BM:2,6-Py-based device is noticeably higher across the entire photoresponse range, especially in the long wavelength region with a higher recombination possibility. The integrated photocurrent density based on EQE is 22.05 mA cm−2 for the treated device and 19.55 mA cm−2 for the untreated device, which are well consistent with those from J–V measurements.

To check the reproducibility of device performance, we compared the statistical PCE distributions of 50 devices. As shown in Fig. 5b, the (2,6-Py)/PC61BM:2,6-Py-based devices exhibited much improved reproducibility with lower PCE distributions: around 90% of the statistical treated devices exhibited a PCE of over 17.5% (about 90% of the champion PCE). In contrast, only about 30% of the statistical control devices showed a PCE of over 14.0% (about 90% of the champion PCE). Meanwhile, the treated perovskite solar cells also deliver a reduction in standard deviation in photovoltaic parameters, especially the JSC, thus resulting in a homogeneous average PCE of 18.82 ± 0.80%, compared to 13.93 ± 1.45% for control devices, as shown in Table 1. These results support our design rationale of adopting interface chemistry engineering using 2,6-Py for reproducible high-efficiency perovskite solar cells.
Instability issues remain a key challenge to the commercialization of perovskite solar cells. In our study, we investigated the photo-stability of the perovskite solar cells by simulating the normal working conditions of a solar cell in daily life. The solar cells were operated at a constant voltage bias (the maximum power point of the J–V curve, Vmpp) under continuous AM 1.5 light illumination. It is found that the steady output PCEs of high-efficiency p–i–n planar PVSCs usually decay after a few hundred seconds of illumination,41–43 implying poor photo-stability. Interestingly, after around 2 hours of testing in a N2-filled glovebox, the (2,6-Py)/PC61BM:2,6-Py-based devices still show a stable steady output PCE of about 19.10% and even an observed increasing trend of PCE (Fig. 5c). In comparison, the control devices also exhibit a stable PCE of 14.73% but with a slight decrease. These devices were then stored under ambient conditions (25 °C, 40% relative humidity) to investigate their environmental stability. The evolution of their PCEs as a function of storage time is shown in Fig. 5d and S8.† The (2,6-Py)/PC61BM:2,6-Py-based devices have a much better ambient stability, that is they can maintain about 80% of their initial PCEs after 200 h without any encapsulation, while only 60% of their initial PCEs was observed for control devices. The undercoordinated Pb2+ at the perovskite crystal surface could form lead oxide and hydroxide when exposed to oxygen and water,44,45 leading to degradation of the device performance, thereby reducing the long-term stability. Thus, the 2,6-Py coating passivates the undercoordinated traps as well as induces a better coverage of the PC61BM film onto the perovskite layer that could delay permeation rate of oxygen and water, thus yielding improved stability of the devices.
3. Conclusion
In summary, we have demonstrated the dual function of 2,6-dimethoxypyridine as a Lewis base for surface passivation and as a dopant for PC61BM in the fabrication of highly reproducible and high-efficiency planar perovskite solar cells. The simple interface engineering approach enables efficient passivation of the undercoordinated-ion surface traps of the perovskite, provides higher conductivity of the PC61BM, and improves the charge extraction. As a result, the best-performing device based on (2,6-Py)/PC61BM:2,6-Py achieved a highest PCE of up to 19.41%, much higher than 15.53% of the control devices without any treatment. Even more encouraging is the improved device reproducibility with narrower PCE distributions: most of the statistical efficiencies are greater than 17.5%. Therefore, the new, low-cost and effective 2,6-dimethoxypyridine can be widely used for realizing highly reproducible and efficient perovskite solar cells.
4. Experimental section
4.1 Perovskite device fabrication
Methylamine iodide (MAI) and lead(II) iodide (PbI2) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. [6,6]-Phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) was purchased from Lumitech. All chemicals were used as received without further purification. ITO-coated glass was sequentially cleaned with DI water, acetone and isopropyl alcohol, followed by an oxygen plasma treatment for 5 min. For the NiOx layer, nickel acetate precursors (nickel acetate tetrahydrate in monoethanolamine and methoxyethanol solution with a weight percentage of 3%) were spin-coated on the ITO substrates at 3000 rpm for 30 s, and then annealed on a hot plate at 150 °C for 10 min, and 350 °C for 20 min in air, followed by oxygen plasma treatment for 4 min before further use. After depositing the hole transport layer, the MAPbI3 absorber layer was then deposited by a consecutive two-step spin-coating method; first, a mixture of 1.3 M PbI2 and 0.3 M MAI in anhydrous dimethylformamide (DMF) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (9:1, v/v) was spin-coated onto the ITO/NiOx substrates at 6000 rpm for 15 s, and then the speed was decreased to 3700 rpm, and the MAI solution (35 mg mL−1 in isopropanol) was dripped on the spinning substrates after the start of 3700 rpm. Then, the films were dried on a hot plate at 100 °C for 30 min. Afterward, the PC61BM solution (20 mg mL−1 in chlorobenzene) with different doping ratios of 2,6-Py was then deposited on top of the formed perovskite layers. For 2,6-Py surface treatment, the 2,6-Py diluted solution in chlorobenzene (1:100, v/v) was directly spin-coated onto the perovskite crystals at 2000 rpm for 60 s. Subsequently, a thin layer (5 nm) of PEI in isopropanol (0.1 wt%) was spin-coated onto the PC61BM layer as a buffer layer to enhance the electron extraction. Finally, 80 nm-thick Ag electrodes were thermally evaporated on top of the devices through a metal shadow mask under high vacuum (<10−7 Torr). The active area of the devices was 0.1058 cm2.
4.2 Characterization
Liquid state 1H NMR spectra of the perovskite samples were measured on a Bruker AV400-400 MHz spectrometer in C3D7NO. The absorption spectra of the doped PC61BM films were taken by using a UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometer (UV-3600, Shimadzu). X-ray diffraction (XRD) data of the perovskite films were determined using a Philips diffractometer (X'pert PRO MRD) using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.540598 Å) as the X-ray source at room temperature. The steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra were measured at room temperature by using a LabRAM HR800 Roman Microscope with a 150 W Xe lamp as an excitation source at 450 nm. TRPL decay spectra were measured using a Delta Flex Fluorescence Lifetime System monitored at 770 nm. AFM morphology of the films was measured through tapping mode on a Shimadzu SPM9700 under ambient conditions. The electron mobility of the doped PC61BM films was tested in the electron-only device of ITO/ZnO (20 nm)/PC61BM or doped PC61BM/Ca (20 nm)/Al (80 nm) by recording dark current–voltage through applying sufficient voltage to form the space charge limited (SCLC) current. The SCLC is described by the equation of J = 9εrε0μV2/8L3, where εr is the dielectric constant of PC61BM (typical value of 3), ε0 is the permittivity of free charge, μ is the carrier mobility, V is the voltage drop across the device (V = Vappl − Vrs − Vbi, where Vappl is the applied voltage, Vrs is from contact and series resistance, and Vbi is from built-in voltage), and L is the thickness of the film. The conductivities (in parallel with the substrate) of the doped PC61BM films were calculated according our previous reports.46 In brief, the doped PC61BM solution is spin-coated onto pre-patterned ITO with a channel length (l) of 0.3 mm and width (a) of 15 mm (Fig. S2†). The resistance between both ITO electrodes approximately corresponds to the resistance of the doped PC61BM in the channel. The conductivity (σ) is estimated based on the equation of σ = l/(R × a × d), where the d is the thickness of the doped PC61BM films and R represents the resistance obtained from the current–voltage (J–V) measurements (Fig. S2†). The photovoltaic J–V curves of the as-prepared solar cells were tested in a nitrogen-filled glovebox illuminated under AM 1.5 G irradiation (100 mW cm−2) from a 450 W solar simulator (Newport 94023A-U) and recorded using a Keithley 2400 source-measure unit. The light intensity is calibrated by using a standard silicon solar cell. The scan rate was 20 mV s−1. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) test was performed by using a EQE system equipped with a standard Si diode using a 150 W xenon lamp (Oriel) fitted with a monochromator (Cornerstone 74004) as a monochromatic light source.
