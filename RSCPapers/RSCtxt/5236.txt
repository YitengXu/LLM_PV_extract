1. Introduction
Binary semiconducting metal oxide (II–VI and IV–VI oxide) micro/nanostructures, including TiO2, ZnO and SnO2, have attracted much attention in recent decades for their unique properties, which render them suitable for widespread applications in energy conversion, catalysts and sensing.1–5 However, there is an urgent need for further development of semiconductors with heightened physicochemical properties to better expand their practical applications. There is a renewed interest in the investigation of ternary oxide semiconductors (II–IV–VI oxides) which are chemically more stable, making them ideal for use in extreme conditions.6
As a typical class of ternary oxides, zinc stannate (ZnSnO3 and Zn2SnO4), which is generally called zinc tin oxide (ZTO), has received much attention because of its high electron mobility, high electrical conductivity, attractive optical properties as well as good stability compared with its binary counterparts (such as ZnO and SnO2).7 ZTO-based micro/nanostructures are suitable for application in the fields of solar cells, gas sensing, catalysis, and anode materials for lithium batteries, resulting in tremendous endeavors into rapid development of ZTO micro/nanostructures with well-tuned composite, phase, and morphology.7
To date, morphological ZTO micro/nanostructures, such as zero-dimensional (0D) nanodots,8–10 one-dimensional (1D) nanowires,11–33 two-dimensional (2D) nanoplates or nanosheets,34–36 three-dimensional (3D) polyhedral and hierarchical as well as hollow architectures, have been successfully synthesized.37–71 The synthetic methods that have been reported for ZTO micro/nanostructures can be widely classified into the following types: thermal evaporation, high-temperature calcination, mechanical grinding, sol–gel synthesis, hydrothermal/solvothermal approach, and ion-exchange reaction.7 Among them, the hydrothermal/solvothermal strategy has been confirmed to be a facile and effective pathway for synthesizing highly crystalline and phase-pure ZTO nanostructures.7 However, investigation into hydrothermal/solvothermal growth of ZTO micro/nanostructures is in its infancy, with reports highlighting the final obtained morphologies. The formation mechanisms of a number of ZTO micro/nanostructures have not been appropriately comprehended, and it has not yet been possible to deliberately tune the reaction kinetics for controllable synthesis.72,73 Consequently, the development of novel ZTO micro/nanostructures with controllable building blocks and interfacial/electronic structures remains an interesting and challenging topic for both fundamental research and technological application.
In light of the above mentioned advancements, it would be useful to summarize the prevailing ZTO micro/nanostructures with controllable morphologies. However, a comprehensive review of morphological ZTO micro/nanostructures is lacking. Thus, the present review is devoted to highlighting recent progress in morphological ZTO micro/nanostructures (see Fig. 1). Firstly, an overview is given of the various synthetic strategies, formation mechanisms and the fundamental properties of morphological ZTO micro/nanostructures. Next, current applications of ZTO and ZTO-based micro/nanostructures are summarized. Remarks on some difficulties, emerging issues and perspective are also given.

2. Crystal structure and growth theory of ZTO
In recent decades, great efforts have been made to synthesize various ZTO micro/nanostructures through different synthetic methods. There is a need to summarize the emerging growth mechanisms with a view to developing new strategies to achieve morphology-controlled synthesis and expand practical applications. This subsection introduces the crystal structure properties of ZTO. Then, an overview is given of basic growth theories for the designated synthesis of ZTO micro/nanostructures with well-defined morphologies.
2.1 Crystal structure

2.1.1 Crystal structure of ZnSnO3. 
There are two main viewpoints on the structure of ZnSnO3, including LiNbO3 (LN) type and perovskite-type oxide. ZnSnO3 has a polar LiNbO3-type structure (space group: R3c, No. 161, Eg = 3.0 eV),74,75 which is primarily characterized by a large displacement of Zn based on strong covalent bonding between Zn and the three O, leading to piezoelectric, ferroelectric, pyroelectric, as well as nonlinear optical response.11,16 A typical atomic structure of LN-type ZnSnO3 is shown in Fig. 2a using octahedral units. It can be seen that each Zn octahedron shares corners with another Zn octahedron, and each Sn octahedron shares corners with another Sn octahedral structure. The cation sequence is Sn–Zn–vacancy–Sn–Zn–vacancy (top to bottom) and is aligned along the z-axis (Fig. 2a). Fig. 2b further gives two octahedral frameworks of ZnO6 (lower side) and SnO6 (upper side). The octahedral SnO6 and ZnO6 share both edges and faces with the adjacent octahedral architecture.11

(d) Crystal structures of cubic inverse spinel Zn2SnO4, reprinted with permission from ref. 76. Copyright ACS 2014. 
Cubic perovskite is another structure of ZnSnO3 (see Fig. 2c),7 including face-centered-cubic and orthorhombic phase,34 which can be synthesized by annealing of different ZnSn(OH)6 precursors. As an fcc crystal, a general sequence of surface energy can be described as follows: γ{111} < γ{100} < γ{110}, which suggests that the ZnSnO3 crystals generally expose {111} facets as the normal surfaces, while the {100} or {110} facets with high surface energies might disappear during a realistic thermodynamic growth process.37


2.1.2 Crystal structure of Zn2SnO4. 
Zn2SnO4 has a cubic inverse spinel structure with a lattice parameter of ∼8.65 Å (space group: Fdm, No. 227, Z = 8) with all tetrahedral sites occupied by Zn2+ cations, while the octahedral sites are occupied randomly by both Zn2+ and Sn4+ cations in equal proportions, as schematically shown in Fig. 2d.76 As an important transparent n-type semiconductor (Eg = 3.6 eV) with high electron conductivity (∼104 S cm−1) and low absorption coefficient as well as high chemical sensitivity and stability, Zn2SnO4 has attracted great attention for its excellent applications in the fields of transparent electrodes, photovoltaic devices, photocatalysts, lithium batteries, as well as sensors for moisture and combustible gas.32

2.2 Crystal growth theory
In terms of the growth mechanisms of inorganic crystals, some basic theories should first be reviewed. Herein, the discussion focuses on crystallographic theory on facet-selective growth.
In theory, the equilibrium morphology of an inorganic crystal is determined by the Gibbs–Wulff's law.77 Generally, a crystallographic facet with high surface energy would reduce or disappear from the final configuration under equilibrium conditions, especially an unstable high-index or high-active facet. However, the final morphology of an inorganic crystal and its exposed facet are a result of interplay between thermodynamics and kinetics under a realistic reaction environment.
From a thermodynamic viewpoint, the morphology-evolution of a crystal is attributed to minimizing the total surface energy. The presence of the capping reagent (including surfactant, polymer, impurity molecule and inorganic ion) in a solution-phase system is crucial for controlling formation of a specific crystallographic facet by a facet-selective adsorption mechanism, which can be viewed as an effective strategy for reducing the surface energy and obtaining a non-equilibrium polyhedral Wulff construction. The capping facet will be retained, but the uncapping facets will disappear. This viewpoint has been confirmed by the literature,78–82 providing a guideline for designated synthesis of polyhedral micro/nanostructures with desired crystallographic facets. Typical geometrically polyhedral models are shown in Fig. 3.78

For ZTO crystals, the selectivity and capability of the capping agent on different facets is basically driven by the surface charges of the corresponding facets, so selection of a capping agent with proper electronegativity is vital for controlling the preserved facets. Organic capping agents can play a significant role in achieving morphology-controlled synthesis of ZTO micro/nanostructures because of their diversities. For example, anionic surfactant (SDBS), cationic surfactant (CTAB) or nonionic surfactant (PVP) can act as effective capping agents for shape-controlled preparation of different polyhedral ZnSnO3 with exposed {100} and {111} facets.37
Kinetically, the polyhedral morphology of a crystal is also greatly driven by the growth rates of different facets.78 Various non-equilibrium architectures can be obtained by adjusting the species of precursor or reducer, which affect the nucleation and manner of growth.38 However, kinetic manipulation always involves a series of complicated factors, thus the relationship between polyhedral structures and kinetic factors remains unclear.
Additionally, supersaturation of a growth species can also determine the surface energies of exposed facets during thermodynamic dissolution–recrystallization hydrothermal/solvothermal growth.62,83 This will be discussed in the following section.
3. Morphology-controlled syntheses
Understanding the synthetic strategies and corresponding formation mechanisms of typical ZTO micro/nanostructures is significant for controllable construction of novel high-performance architectures. For example, 1D ternary oxide, such as ZnSnO3 and Zn2SnO4, can exhibit specific functions that are unattainable by their common binary components. Conventional synthesis methods of the ZTO materials usually include sol–gel synthesis, high-energy ball milling of two binary solid oxides and ion–exchange reaction, which are not suitable for growth of 1D nanostructures. However, high-temperature solid reaction, thermal evaporation or hydrothermal/solvothermal approaches with pure Zn and Sn powders as well as their oxides, have been demonstrated as effective pathways for synthesis of both ZnSnO3 and Zn2SnO4 nanowires via a well-known vapor–liquid–solid (VLS) mechanism.19,84 Moreover, as reported, electrospinning is a facile and versatile technique that uses high electrostatic forces for production of 1D fibers and even membranes, and requires the following: a direct current power supply, a metallic needle with blunt-tip, a syringe for containing the electrospun solution, and a grounded conductive collector.85 Thus the spinel Zn2SnO4 nanofibers can be easily synthesized through in situ phase separation of inorganic precursors and matrix polymers by electrospinning integrated with a calcination technique.32 The next section provides a detailed discussion of formation mechanisms of different 1D ZTO architectures.
Hollow or porous architecture with a large specific surface area, low density, as well as extreme conductivity for charge and mass (gas) transport, can be used as the active component or substrate for active ingredient to enhance performance. Generally, the synthetic strategies for preparing hollow or porous architectures can be divided into two categories based on their formation mechanisms: template-assisted and template-free approaches.86–90 The template-assisted synthetic strategy is one of the most effective approaches towards the synthesis of hollow or porous product with controlled size and morphology, involving duplication of the feature of template and inheritance by the final product after removal of the template. This strategy involves three steps: (i) the synthesis of template, (ii) the direct preparation of target material using the as-prepared template, and (iii) the removal of template (if necessary).87 Notably, the as-prepared products can be synthesized by two types of templates: (i) hard template (solid nanocasting), which can physically confine the size, dimension as well as morphology of the growing particle, and plays a role as a physical structure-directing agent; and (ii) soft template (molecular assembly), as a soft structure-directing agent, can chemically tailor features of the growing particle by adjusting the species and amount of capping agent.90 The template-free approach is an alternative promising strategy to synthesize hollow/porous architecture, which is principally of two types: self-template and self-aggregation strategy.91,92 To date, growth mechanisms for the synthesis of hollow/porous architectures mainly include inside-out Ostwald ripening, oriented attachment, Kirkendall effect, oxidization etching and their combined strategies.91–97
Based on previously mentioned crystal growth theories and synthetic strategies, a number of well-defined morphologies with unique surfaces or building blocks have become ideal models for investigation of structure-dependent properties of materials, and some unusual performances coupled with the special structures (such as the special exposed crystallographic facets, porous/hollow features) have been uncovered.78–82 Therefore, the morphology-controlled synthesis of ZTO micro/nanostructures is could help to reveal the relationship between structure and performance, offering an opportunity to develop appropriate components or substrates for expanded practical applications.
This section highlights the reported synthetic strategies and pathways in controllable preparation of morphological ZTO micro/nanostructures. First, advances in morphology-controlled synthesis of ZnSnO3 micro/nanostructures will be summarized. After this, an overview is given of the design and synthesis of morphological Zn2SnO4 micro/nanostructures. Particular focus is given to ZTO materials with diverse morphologies from 0D, 1D, 2D to different 3D configurations (including hierarchical, hollow and polyhedral architectures). The synthesis pathways and morphologies of ZTO micro/nanostructures are shown in Table 1.

3.1 Morphological ZnSnO3

3.1.1 1D ZnSnO3 nanostructures. 
As a promising non-centrosymmetric oxide, the LN-type ZnSnO3 lattice generally possesses a large displacement of Zn based on strong covalent bonds between three oxygen and zinc atoms,74 yielding unique symmetry-dependent properties, including pyroelectricity, nonlinear optical behavior, strong piezoelectricity and important ferroelectricity.11,16 As a good candidate for fabrication of nanodevices, the 1D ZnSnO3 nanostructure, has attracted much attention regarding crystallography and energy harvesting.
However, the synthesis of LN-type ZnSnO3 is challenging because of the extreme synthetic conditions.98 To solve this problem, Wang and coworkers developed a high-temperature carbon-thermal reaction technique for preparation of rhombohedral-phase ZnSnO3 nanobelts/microbelts using the well-known VLS mechanism.11 A typical synthesis process is as follows. First, a Zn–Sn buffer layer was predeposited on Si and alumina substrates to act as a seed layer. Then the source materials of Zn and Sn (purity: 99.9%) powders were separately placed on an alumina boat, and relative source materials with 50 wt% of graphite powder were positioned in the center zone of a quartz reactor to conduct the carbon-thermal reaction during an annealing process. Next, the mixtures were heated at a constant temperature of 1173 K and maintained at 10–20 Torr for 3 h. During this reaction process, the gas flow rates of argon (Ar) and oxygen (O2, purity: 99.9%) were 200 sccm and 10–20 sccm, respectively. Finally, the as-synthesized ultralong ZnSnO3 microbelts of 300–1000 μm (see Fig. 4a) were used for fabricating single microbelt nanogenerators to uncover their output powers and piezoelectric performances.11 Further adjusting the reaction parameters (such as the amount ration of source materials), Wang's group also fabricated ultrahigh sensitive piezotronic strain sensors and transparent nanogenerators based on ZnSnO3 nanowires/microwires (see Fig. 4b) and triangular-belts (see Fig. 4c), respectively.12,13

(f) Nanorods, reprinted with permission from ref. 17. Copyright RSC 2010. 
The source materials are significant in determining the microstructures of ZnSnO3. For example, novel core–shell structural ZnSnO3 nanowires were synthesized by thermal evaporation of ZnO, SnO and graphite mixed powders, in which a grain boundary occurred between the inner and outer layers (see Fig. 4d).14 Such core–shell nanowires provided a distinct path for current flow, in which the electrons tunneled from the shell layer to the core, transported through the core layer, and finally tunneled back into the shell layer. Therefore, these core–shell structural ZnSnO3 nanowires exhibited nonlinear characteristics and photoconducting under UV and green laser illumination on/off circles.14 However, several impure phases, such as ZnO and SnO2, remained in the final products, so it is imperative to find out how to obtain high-pure ZnSnO3 nanostructures by the high-temperature solid-phase reaction, for optimizing their applications.
The hydrothermal/solvothermal approach has also been employed in controllable synthesis of 1D ZnSnO3 nanostructures. For example, vertically aligned lead-free noncentrosymmetric high purity single-crystal rhombohedral ZnSnO3 nanowires (LN-type, R3c) were successfully synthesized by a two-step hydrothermal reaction (see Fig. 4e). Typically, a mixture of ZnO powder and tin tetrachloride pentahydrate (SnCl4·5H2O)/polyethylene glycol (PEG)/water was prepared first. Then, the sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solution was added to the mixture to fabricate the chemical species of Zn(OH)3− and Sn(OH)5−, ideal precursors for preparing ZnSnO3 after a hydrolysis process. Afterwards, the reactant agent along with the FTO/glass substrate was poured into a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and reacted at 160 °C for 1 h to obtain a ZnSnO3 seed layer. Finally, a second growth of the precursor and the substrate with seed layer was carried out after annealing at 200 °C for 24 h for formation of ZnSnO3 nanowires.15 Similarly, structurally welded ZnSnO3 nanowire arrays can be deposited on the ZnO:Al/Si substrates by hydrothermally heating a mixture solution of Zn(NO3)2·6H2O/urea/sodium stannate trihydrate/water/ethanol at 180 °C for 4–12 h.16 Moreover, ultra-thin 3 nm ZnSnO3 nanorods (see Fig. 4f) can be successfully prepared by hydrothermally heating a mixture of ZnO powder, urea and potassium stannate trihydrate (K2SnO3·3H2O) at 170 °C for 3 h in a water–ethanol system.17 Based on the above hydrothermal mechanisms, it is proposed that novel ZnSnO3 nanostructures could be synthesized by rationally adjusting the source materials and/or introducing additives.


3.1.2 2D ZnSnO3 nanostructures. 
Reports of feasible methods for synthesis of 2D ZnSnO3 nanostructures are rare. Wang and coworkers successfully achieved phase-evolution from 3D face-centered-cubic ZnSnO3 to 2D orthorhombic ZnSnO3 nanosheets for the first time through a dual-hydrolysis-assisted liquid precipitation reaction and subsequent solvothermal treatment.34,35 In a typical synthesis, a white suspension of ZnSn(OH)6 precursors was immediately produced by mixing Na2SnO3·3H2O and Zn(CH3COO)2·H2O water–ethanol solution. The ZnSn(OH)6 precursors were transferred to a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and maintained at 180 °C for 12 h. Afterwards, the products were further calcined at 600 °C for 3 h. Finally, novel 2D ZnSnO3 nanosheets were obtained. In this case, a nucleation–dissolution–recrystallization mechanism was proposed, and a schematic illustration of the possible formation process is shown in Fig. 5a.34 SnO32− + 2H2O → H2SnO3 + OH−(1) CH3COO− + H2O → CH3COOH + OH−(2) Zn2+ + 4H2O → Zn(OH)42− + 4H+(3) H2SnO3 + Zn(OH)42− + 2H+ → ZnSn(OH)6↓ + H2O(4) ZnSn(OH)6 → ZnSnO3 + 3H2O(5)

Initially, the reaction in eqn (1) occurred and led to formation of colloidal H2SnO3 because of the hydrolysis of SnO32− ions. Subsequently, Zn2+ ions reacted with OH− ions and formed the Zn(OH)42− species by dual hydrolysis of CH3COO− and Zn2+ as shown in eqn (2) and (3). After mixing of the reactants, ZnSn(OH)6 nuclei were easily formed by the reaction between H2SnO3 and Zn(OH)42− (as shown in eqn (4)), followed by fast growth of the nuclei into cube-shaped crystals. However, the metastable ZnSn(OH)6 cubes would decompose and recrystallize to obtain stable structures under hydrothermal conditions. ZnSnO3 products can be finally obtained by annealing the ZnSn(OH)6 precursors (see eqn (5)). In this process, the authors have found that the cube-shaped crystals can be further evolved into nanosheets at higher temperature to reduce the surface energy (see Fig. 5b), which was attributed to the reported “dissolution–recrystallization” mechanism.99–101 Moreover, this morphology-evolution of 2D ZnSnO3 nanosheets (see Fig. 5c) can also be achieved in ethylene glycol (EG)–deionized water under otherwise similar conditions.35 However, it remains a great challenge to develop new feasible methods for synthesis of novel 2D ZnSnO3 nanostructures.


3.1.3 3D ZnSnO3 architectures. 
Facet-controlled synthesis. 
Controlled synthesis of polyhedral ZnSnO3 with diverse morphologies can be successfully achieved by a convenient, low-cost, and low-temperature solution-phase reaction without further heat treatment.37 The morphologies of polyhedral ZnSnO3 can evolve from 14-faceted polyhedra to octahedra or from octahedra to 14-faceted polyhedra. In a typical synthesis, SnCl4 solution was added to Zn(CH3COO)2 solution at room temperature with vigorous agitation. Various surfactants in different amounts and a solution of NaOH were introduced to the above mixture. The mixed solution was heated to 85 °C and stirred for 6 h in a beaker. Finally, the white polyhedral ZnSnO3 products were collected by centrifugation and washed repeatedly with ethanol. When an anionic SDBS surfactant was used, 14-faceted polyhedra were synthesized at a low SDBS concentration (<0.25 M); truncated octahedra were obtained at a medium SDBS concentration (0.3–0.5 M); and when the SDBS concentrations ranged from 0.5 to 1.0 M, the as-synthesized products were regular octahedra. This shape-evolution form is shown in Fig. 6a–c. When a cationic CTAB surfactant was used, regular octahedra were formed at a low CTAB concentration (<0.25 M); truncated octahedra were prepared at a medium CTAB concentration (0.3–0.5 M); while the as-synthesized products were regular 14-faceted polyhedral at a higher CTAB concentration (0.5–1.0 M). This shape-evolution form is shown in Fig. 6d–f. Intrinsically, the morphology of a ZnSnO3 crystal depends on the ratio (R) of the growth rate along the 〈100〉 direction to that along the 〈111〉 direction, as shown in Fig. 6g. An increase in the anionic SDBS surfactant will result in a higher value of R. Namely, the shape changed to 14-faceted polyhedral to truncated octahedral and lastly to regular octahedral. Whereas an increase in the cationic CTAB surfactant will lead to a lower R value, which is the reverse of that observed with the anionic SDBS surfactant. Emphatically, cubic ZnSnO3 exposed with six {100} facets can be synthesized in the absence of any surfactant under otherwise similar reaction conditions (see Fig. 6h).38 A possible growth mechanism of the cubic ZnSnO3 microcrystal is as follows. The growth of ZnSnO3 nanocrystals under hydrothermal conditions involved the formation and then decomposition of unstable phase ZnSn(OH)6. Then, the as-formed ZnSnO3 nanocrystals underwent a “dissolution–recrystallization” process and further aggregated into a larger particle because of Ostwald ripening. Afterwards, the aggregates developed into cubic morphologies with reaction time increase. Finally, these cubic ZnSnO3 continually adsorbed the small nanoparticles onto their surfaces, leading to formation of large cubes.

Size-controlled synthesis. 
Uniform and monodisperse ZnSnO3 cubes can be synthesized by a liquid-phase synthesis involving reaction of ZnSO4 and Na2SnO3 at reaction temperature as low as 0 °C without any surfactant. A schematic illustration for the possible growth mechanism of cubic ZnSnO3 is shown in Fig. 7a.39 In this synthesis, mixing of Zn2+ and SnO32− resulted in formation of colloid ZnSnO3 nanoparticles immediately in solution, which were partially dissolved in water to form a metastable supersaturated transparent solution. Subsequently, the self-aggregated ZnSnO3 nanoclusters further grew into cubic crystallites. Then, a few amorphous species attached on the surface of cubic crystals. These attached small amorphous nanoparticles dwindled and led to formation of large cubic crystals because of the Ostwald ripening mechanism. Finally, the suspended amorphous nanoparticles were fully consumed, and the well-defined cubic products were synthesized along with the reaction time increase. Significantly, the size could be easily manipulated from 40 to 600 nm by adjusting the reaction temperature (see Fig. 7b–f).39

In addition, a facile solution-phase strategy combined with a subsequent annealing process has been demonstrated for size-controlled synthesis of porous ZnSnO3 cubes.40 A typical synthesis procedure is as follows: a mixture of SnCl4·5H2O and NaOH was dissolved in deionized water under vigorous stirring at room temperature, followed by addition of NaOH aqueous solution to adjust the pH value. Then, ZnSO4·7H2O aqueous solution was added to the mixed solution at a temperature of 60 °C for 12 h to form the white cubic ZnSn(OH)6 precursors. Notably, the size of ZnSn(OH)6 precursors was carefully controlled from 80–100 nm to 280–310 nm by adjusting the pH value of the solution. Hence, the size-controlled synthesis of cubic ZnSnO3 can be finally achieved after a calcination process.40
Phase-controlled synthesis. 
In general, ZnSnO3 has an orthorhombic (orth) phase and a face-centered cubic (fcc) phase. Experimentally, individual orthorhombic and face-centered cubic ZnSnO3 obtained synchronously in one solution can be achieved by hydrothermal treatment of a mixture containing a small quantity of ZnO powder, urea, and K2SnO3·3H2O. In a typical synthesis, the ZnO precursor was first synthesized through hydrothermal treatment of a mixture of pure zinc foil and sodium dioctyl sulfosuccinate solution. Then the as-synthesized ZnO foil was further hydrothermally treated in a mixture of urea/K2SnO3·3H2O/ethanol/water system. Finally, pure orth-ZnSnO3 solid microspheres were obtained in the solution, and pure fcc-ZnSnO3 hollow microspheres were formed on the ZnO inducing template. A possible growth mechanism of the orth-ZnSnO3 solid microspheres and fcc-ZnSnO3 hollow microspheres is shown in Fig. 8.41
 Fig. 8  Possible growth mechanism of the orth-ZnSnO3 solid microspheres and fcc-ZnSnO3 hollow microspheres. Reprinted with permission from ref. 41. Copyright ACS 2014. 
Based on the experimental results, it has been found that solid sphere-like ZnSnO3 particles were formed in short reaction time by recrystallization of the dissolving ZnO nanoparticles in urea/K2SnO3·3H2O/ethanol/water solution, and that the morphologies of the particles would become uniform along with the reaction time increase (see process I). In this process, tiny ZnSnO3 nanoparticles also evolved from the falling ZnO templates in solution, would continuously aggregate and nucleate based on orth-ZnSnO3 structure. Furthermore, the as-formed ZnSnO3 nanoparticles can also cover the whole ZnO surface, leading to formation of ZnSnO3 shells on ZnO templates, which favors lowering of the total surface energy of the reaction system. Thus, fcc-ZnSnO3 hollow microspheres would be synthesized after consuming the ZnO templates completely (see process II). In this case, the ZnO structural host motifs can react with OH− ions and K2SnO3 with slight lattice rotation and rearrangement of crystal structure, leading to a favorable matching structure for fcc-ZnSnO3. Additionally, it has been found that pure orth-ZnSnO3 products were prepared only when the reaction temperature was above 100 °C, and neither reactant concentration nor reaction time had obvious effect on the growth of orth-ZnSnO3. Thus, it is proposed that formation of orth-ZnSnO3 was mainly controlled thermodynamically. While both reaction temperature and reactant concentration were crucial to the crystal structure of the fcc-ZnSnO3 product, which was affected by both thermodynamic and kinetic parameters. Based on the above results, this facile and cost-effective approach provides a new platform to achieve phase-separation of ZnSnO3, which is of great industrial interest.41
Hollow architectures. 
For the synthesis of 3D hollow ZnSnO3 architectures, an etching strategy has been employed. This can be divided into two pathways according to the species of etching agent: acid agent or basic agent. For example, cubic solid ZnSnO3 microcrystals can be facilely converted to cubic hollow structures through a nitride acid (HNO3) etching process, in which the surface defects of ZnSnO3 templates offer energetically favored sites for absorption of H+ ions from the acid solution of HNO3 and are suitable for dissolution of ZnSnO3. By comparison, the smooth and compact surfaces of the ZnSnO3 microcubes may not be helpful for dissolution of ZnSnO3. In the present case, etching on the surface of defected ZnSnO3 can drive outward diffusion of cations and further enhance the surface defects, resulting in inward dissolution of the ZnSnO3 (step 1). Then, the continuous outward diffusion of the reactive species and the accumulation of pores inside the template would lead to formation of large voids under the surface matter (or shell) (step 2). Finally, the well-defined shell is maintained by the balance of inward and outward diffusion (step 3) at a given etching time. A possible mechanism showing the etching process (see Fig. 9a(I)) and corresponding TEM images of the products synthesized by etching cubic ZnSnO3 templates at different stage (see Fig. 9a(II)) are displayed in Fig. 9a.38 Biomorphic hollow ZnSnO3 fibers (see Fig. 9b(I)) have been produced using cotton as biotemplates, in which cotton fibers were infiltrated with Zn(NO3)2/SnCl4/HCl solution and subsequently sintered in air at high temperature to obtain the ZnSnO3 hollow fibers.42 The HCl was important for the synthesis of hollow structures, as also demonstrated in the case of hollow 14-faceted polyhedral ZnSnO3 (see Fig. 9b(II)).43 In addition, carbon spheres acting as hard templates can be used in synthesis of hollow ZnSnO3 cages, in which the reactant agents involved a mixed SnCl2/Zn(CH3COO)2/HCl solution. The pre-treating carbon/ZnSn(OH)6 was formed first, and the hollow cages were synthesized after calcinating the precursor at 600 °C for 2 h in a muffle furnace.44 However, the hard-template strategy for synthesizing hollow ZnSnO3 cages is still in its infancy, and further efforts should be devoted to developing novel synthetic routes to enrich the family of hollow ZnSnO3.

As an alternative etching agent, NaOH solution can be used in synthesizing hollow ZnSnO3 architectures, acting as both reactant agent and etching agent.45,46 In a typical synthesis, solid ZnSn(OH)6 cubic precursors were first obtained by mixing a C6H8O7/SnCl4/ZnCl2/NaOH solution, then hollow ZnSn(OH)6 cubic architectures were formed after further adding NaOH solution. Finally, hollow ZnSn(OH)6 precursors were transferred into hollow ZnSnO3 through a sintering process at higher temperature. A schematic representation of the microstructure evolution of the hollow ZnSnO3 is shown in Fig. 9c.45 Notably, Xu and coworkers found that only SnCl4/ZnCl2/NaOH solution can achieve the preparation of hollow ZnSnO3 boxes (see Fig. 9d) based on the above mentioned etching mechanism.47 Similarly, one-pot synthesis of hierarchically hollow ZnSnO3 cages has also been achieved by hydrothermally heating a mixed solution of SnCl4/Zn(CH3COO)2/NaOH according to Oswald ripening, in which an excessive amount of NaOH was imperative.48–51

3.2 Morphological Zn2SnO4

3.2.1 0D Zn2SnO4 nanoparticles. 
Ultrafine nanoparticles can display great advantages resulting from quantum size effects and have long been an intensive field of research. Ultrafine nanoparticles with high surface areas not only significantly shorten the transport distance of charge carriers, but also increase the contact area between materials and reactants, thus providing more active sites. Consequently, ultrafine 0D Zn2SnO4 nanoparticles have been widely used in the fields of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs),8 lithium ion batteries (LIBs),9 and sensing.10 As reported, the additive-assisted hydrothermal synthetic strategy is an effective approach for preparation of ultrafine 0D Zn2SnO4 nanoparticles in a Sn4+/Zn2+/OH− reaction system at higher concentrations of OH− (see eqn (6)–(8)), which can be attributed to the “crystallization–dissolution–recrystallization” mechanism.10 The type of structure-directing agent is crucial, with an important role in formation of nanostructures, especially in controlling their sizes. For example, 0D Zn2SnO4 nanoparticles with an average size of ∼8 nm were successfully fabricated by a facile hydrothermal method using ammonium carbonate as the precipitant (see Fig. 10a).8 0D Zn2SnO4 nanoparticles with an average size about 8–10 nm have also been synthesized through a hydrothermal route using potassium sodium tartrate as a structure-directing agent.9 Moreover, fast and simple synthesis of single phase Zn2SnO4 quantum dot with good crystallinity and a narrow size distribution was achieved by a microwave-assisted hydrothermal approach (see Fig. 10b).10 However, synthesis of ultrafine and mono-dispersive 0D Zn2SnO4 nanoparticles remains a challenge, because the small nanoparticles with high surface energies tend to aggregate and ripen into larger ones because of the high temperature and pressure used in traditional hydrothermal processes. Zn2+ + Sn4+ + 6OH− → ZnSn(OH)6(6) Zn2+ + 4OH− → Zn(OH)42−(7) ZnSn(OH)6 + Zn(OH)42− → Zn2SnO4 + 4H2O + 2OH−(8)

3.2.2 1D Zn2SnO4 nanostructures. 
Thermal evaporation. 
Generally, 1D Zn2SnO4 nanostructures (including nanowires and nanobelts) can be synthesized on the basis of the VLS growth mechanism.18–31 Tuning thermal evaporation of the source mixture is significant for synthesis of single phase Zn2SnO4 nanowires. In addition, the catalyst (such as gold nanoparticles), substrate (such as alumina, Si or SiO2/Si), carrier gas (argon and its mixture gas of hydrogen or oxygen) and higher temperature (800–1000 °C) are also imperative. This subsection discusses thermal evaporation strategies for synthesizing diversiform 1D Zn2SnO4 nanostructures according to the different types of source materials.
Source of ZnO and SnO2. 
Commercial ZnO, SnO2 and activated carbon powders can act as the source materials for synthesizing 1D Zn2SnO4 nanostructures.18,19 In a typical synthesis, the milling of the mixture of ZnO, SnO2 and activated carbon powder was carried out first, then subsequently the milled powder mixture was transferred into a quartz boat and placed in the center of a horizontal tube furnace. Then the alumina substrate was placed at various positions away from the source powder. Afterwards, the temperature of the furnace was increased from room temperature to higher temperature more than 900 °C under an argon gas flow. At higher temperatures, Zn and Sn were vaporized after reduction by activated carbon, and the vapor reacted with the gold nanoparticle catalysts on the substrate to generate Au–Sn–Zn liquid alloy droplets. These alloy droplets further reacted with oxygen and grew to Zn2SnO4 nanowires by absorbing more Zn and Sn vapor at the tips of gold nanoparticles. The possible growth process is shown in Fig. 11a.19 Therefore, the carbon-assisted thermal evaporation process is a facile pathway for preparation of a large amount of Zn2SnO4 nanowires under ambient pressure (see Fig. 11b–e).19

Source of ZnO and SnO. 
Pseudoperiodically twinned Zn2SnO4 nanowires can be synthesized by thermal evaporation of a mixture containing ZnO and SnO powders with a weight ratio of 2:1. The reaction was carried out at 1000 °C under a pure argon gas flow, and the products were formed on gold-deposited Si substrates under a high vacuum. It can be seen that the as-prepared nanowires have zigzag shapes with octahedral building blocks (see Fig. 12a).20 An alternative zigzag-shaped Zn2SnO4 nanowire with rhombohedral building blocks growing along the [11] axis (see Fig. 12b) can be synthesized by increasing the weight ratio of ZnO and SnO powders (4:1) under a mixed carrier gas of argon and oxygen at 1090 °C.21 When carbon powders were introduced into the mixture of ZnO and SnO powders with weight ratio of 1:1, smooth Zn2SnO4 nanowires along 〈111〉 directions (see Fig. 12c) were formed under an argon/oxygen atmosphere at 800 °C.22 Self-catalytic formation of Zn2SnO4 nanowires with smooth surfaces (the growth direction is 〈311〉, see Fig. 12d) can be achieved by heating a mixture of ZnO and SnO powders without any catalyst under an argon/hydrogen atmosphere at 875 °C.23 During this reaction, SnO powder can initially decompose into atomic Sn and SnO2. Subsequently, ZnO powder changed into vapor after heating and reacted with the above SnO2 to form Zn2SnO4. At the same time, the reduced Sn reacted with ZnO and O2 can also generate Zn2SnO4.23

Source of ZnO and Sn. 
The zigzagged or straight Zn2SnO4 nanowires can be grown on Au-deposited substrates at 900–1000 °C using thermal evaporation of ZnO/Sn powders under nitrogen or argon gas, respectively (see Fig. 13).24 According to the growth theory of Zn2SnO4, if the axial [111] direction growth is integrated with the active growth along the [110] direction, the growing facets would be tilted and zigzagged, leading to the distinctive zigzagged morphology (see Fig. 13a). While the growth of the lowest-surface energy (111) facets (along the [1] direction) becomes kinetically favorable at higher temperature, resulting in formation of the straight Zn2SnO4 nanowires (see Fig. 13b). Moreover, nitrogen molecules could quench the thermal energy more efficiently than could argon molecules, which may lead to the zigzagged nanowires under a slow growth model.24

Source of Zn and SnO. 
Zn2SnO4 nanowires can also be synthesized by thermal evaporation of Zn/SnO mixture. For example, thermal evaporation of source material that consisted of Zn foil and SnO powder under nitrogen gas at 900 °C resulted in fabrication of twinned Zn2SnO4 nanowires composed of rhombohedral building blocks growing along the [11] axis (see Fig. 14a).25 Importantly, it has been demonstrated that the weight ratio of Zn and SnO powders is crucial for controllable synthesis of zigzagged or straight Zn2SnO4 nanostructures. Obvious zigzagged Zn2SnO4 nanowires exposed with rhombohedral building blocks were synthesized on a gold-deposited silicon wafer by heating a mixture of Zn and SnO powders with weight ratio of 1:3 (see Fig. 14b).26 While zigzagged Zn2SnO4 nanowire exposed with octahedral building blocks were synthesized by changing the weight ratio to 1:4 (see Fig. 14c).26 Notably, the above synthesis was carried out under an argon atmosphere at 1000 °C and a higher vacuum. However, when the source material of Zn and SnO powders had weight ratio of 1:5, the zigzagged Zn2SnO4 nanowire exposed with rhombohedral building blocks can appear again without the assistance of gold nanoparticle catalysts (see Fig. 14d).27 Interestingly, novel Zn2SnO4 nanobelts and nanorings (see Fig. 14e) can be fabricated on pure Si substrate using the Zn and SnO powders with weight ratio of 2:1 at 1000 °C under argon/oxygen atmosphere.28

Source of Zn and Sn. 
Similarly, smooth Zn2SnO4 nanowires can be prepared by thermal evaporation of Zn/Sn powder with lower weight ratio (see Fig. 15a and b), which can also be attributed to a typical vapor–liquid–solid process.29,30 However, single-crystalline Zn2SnO4 hexangular microprisms (see Fig. 15c) were synthesized by thermal evaporation of a mixture of Zn and Sn powders with higher weight ratio of 5:1.31

Notably, although the above mentioned thermal evaporation technique was effective for synthesis of 1D Zn2SnO4 nanostructures with different structural features, the ZnO nanowires were always generated in the final products. Consequently, a post-treatment should be done to optimize the purity of Zn2SnO4.
Electrospinning. 
As a very facile and robust technique to transform solution or melts into continuous fibers, electrospinning has attracted much attention in both fundamental research and commerce. A variety of Zn2SnO4 fibers with controllable morphologies have been synthesized by electrospinning.
Microstructural evolution of spinel Zn2SnO4 fibers was tailored by an in situ phase-separation process of inorganic precursors (zinc acetate and tin(IV) acetate) and matrix polymers (polyvinylacetate and polyvinylpyrrolidone) during electrospinning and calcination. Initially, zinc acetate/tin(IV) acetate/polyvinylacetate composite fibers were formed by electrospinning, and then the calcination of these composite fibers at 700 °C resulted in formation of porous Zn2SnO4 fibers because of decomposition of the polyvinylacetate matrix and crystallization of zinc acetate/tin(IV) acetate precursors into inverse spinel Zn2SnO4. While dense Zn2SnO4 fibers were synthesized by calcination of zinc acetate/tin(IV) acetate/polyvinylpyrrolidone composite fibers. The typical morphologies of the porous (yellow color) and dense (blue color) Zn2SnO4 fibers are shown in Fig. 16a.32 Moreover, porous Zn2SnO4 fibers can also be prepared by calcination of zinc acetate/tin(II) acetate/polyvinylpyrrolidone composite fibers at 700 °C (see Fig. 16b and c), and reaction temperature is crucial for controlling the porous microstructures.33 However, electrospinning synthesis of ZnSnO3 nanofibers has not been reported so far. Significantly, it is proposed that ZTO-based heterogeneous architectures might be synthesized by a modified electrospinning technique.

3.2.3 2D Zn2SnO4 nanosheets. 
There is still much opportunity in development of facile routes for large-scale synthesis of 2D Zn2SnO4 nanostructures. In general, when the growth rate of an inorganic crystal becomes substantially slow, the nucleation and growth will be kinetically controlled, and the final product could have a morphology deviating from the thermodynamic one.102 For instance, hierarchical Zn2SnO4 nanosheets consisting of fine nanoparticle building blocks have been prepared by hydrothermally heating a mixture containing Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O, SnCl4·5H2O, diethanolamine and NH4F in a diethyleneglycol (DEG) and water mixture solvent. In this synthesis, formation of hierarchical Zn2SnO4 nanosheets can be attributed to the influence of the F− ions in the hydrothermal process. The F− ions may interact strongly with (111) facets, which would reduce the surface energy and kinetically inhibit the crystal growth along (111) facets, thus leading to the appearance of (111) facets and inducing the oriental attachment, finally resulting in generation of hierarchical Zn2SnO4 nanosheets consisting of nanoparticle building blocks. The morphology of the product is shown in Fig. 17.36 Furthermore, use of other fluoride salts (e.g. NaF and KF) also yielded similar hierarchical Zn2SnO4 nanosheet structure. The appearance of the 2D nanosheets further enriches the fundamental growth theory of Zn2SnO4 and offers experimental and academic evidence for exploring high-activity Zn2SnO4, but new synthetic methods are still needed for effectively developing novel 2D Zn2SnO4 nanostructures.

3.2.4 3D Zn2SnO4 architectures. 
Polyhedral Zn2SnO4. 
The controllable-index facet of a polyhedral Zn2SnO4 crystal is as significant as its size, phase and crystallinity in determining the chemical and physical properties. Hence, better understanding of the control mechanism of polyhedral Zn2SnO4 would provide new capability in design of necessary structures for practical application. So far, octahedral and cubic Zn2SnO4 exposed with smooth and hierarchical surfaces are well-reported architectures.52–61 Herein, advances are highlighted in the morphology-controlled synthesis of polyhedral Zn2SnO4 exposed with different surfaces.
Octahedral Zn2SnO4 single crystals exposed with eight smooth {111} facets, as shown in Fig. 18a, can be synthesized by hydrothermally heating a mixed solution of Zn(CH3COO)2/SnCl4/NaOH.53 Synthesis of these octahedral architectures did not involve surfactant in the reaction system, which suggests that {111} facets were the most thermodynamically stable facets. The composites and phases of the products can be tuned by adjusting various synthetic conditions, including the Zn/Sn ratio, the concentration of NaOH, and the reaction temperature. Similarly, an alternative synthetic approach involving the hydrothermal treatment of a mixed solution of Zn(CH3COO)2/Na2SnO3/NaOH (ratio = 1:1:15) can also be used to prepare octahedral Zn2SnO4 single crystals, and a typical scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image is shown in Fig. 18b.54 In addition, octahedral Zn2SnO4 were formed in a Zn(CH3COO)2/SnCl2/NaOH system under hydrothermal conditions.38 Notably, pure Zn2SnO4 crystals with diffraction peaks assigned to the cubic spinel structure can be realized by treatment with acid to remove the impure oxide powders. However, the exact formation mechanisms of the above octahedral Zn2SnO4 are not given in these references.

Novel hexagonal nanoplate-textured micro-octahedral Zn2SnO4 (see Fig. 18c) can be synthesized by hydrothermally treating a mixed solution of Zn(CH3COO)2/SnCl4/NaOH with the assistance of L-tryptophan.55 The experimental results showed that the formation process of hierarchically octahedral Zn2SnO4 was based on evolution of octahedral Zn2SnO4 with smooth surfaces. Initially, common octahedral Zn2SnO4 with smooth surfaces were formed in a short reaction time according to the basic thermodynamic viewpoint. In a Zn2SnO4 lattice, the {111} termination surface generally consisted of a layer of unsaturated Zn and Sn atoms with dangling bonds, while the {100} termination surface contained O–M–O layers (M = Zn, Sn), which suggested that the {111} terminated facet was a more positive surface, thus COO− species of L-tryptophan may act as a ligand to selectively adsorb on charged Zn(II) and Sn(IV) sites to lower the reaction rate of {111} during the nucleation and growth, resulting in a relatively fast growth rate along the 〈100〉 direction, and subsequent formation of octahedral configurations. Therefore, formation of octahedral Zn2SnO4 microcrystals was believed to originate from higher growth rates of {100} facets than {111} facets. Then, it would be found that hexagonal nanoplates grew on the edges of the octahedra, and further formed the “texture-like” architectures, which finally covered all the pristine {111} surfaces along with the time increase. The authors believed that a crystal lattice match between the growing facets of the nanoplate building blocks and the basal {111} facets was responsible for these hierarchically textured structures.55 Similarly, octahedral Zn2SnO4 assembled with hexagon nanoplates (see Fig. 18d) have been prepared by means of hydrothermally treating a mixed solution of ZnSO4/SnCl4/NaOH/CTAB, which was dominated by a crystallization–dissolution–recrystallization mechanism.56 In this case, CTAB played an important role in formation of well-defined hierarchically octahedral microstructures. The detailed formation process involved the following three growth stages: (i) generation of primary metastable intermediate phase cube-shaped ZnSn(OH)6; (ii) dissolution of cube-shaped ZnSn(OH)6 precursors and subsequent formation of Zn2SnO4 nuclei; (iii) self-assembling Zn2SnO4 octahedral microstructures composed of hexagon nanoplates by interaction between CTAB and Zn2SnO4 building blocks.
Surfactant-assisted synthetic strategy is also effective to limit the growth rate of {100} facet, leading to formation of cubic Zn2SnO4 crystals. For example, CTAB has also been used for achieving formation of cubic Zn2SnO4 microstructures (see Fig. 18e), based on a hydrothermal reaction of ZnCl2/SnCl4/NaOH solution. It has been proposed that cationic CTAB surfactant is easily absorbed on the negative {100} facets to promote the appearance in the final configurations, but the realistic mechanism requires further investigation.57 CATB can be replaced by cellulose acetate for synthesis of cubic Zn2SnO4 microcrystals under otherwise similar conditions.58 Furthermore, Zn2SnO4 nanoplate-built hierarchical cube-like structures (see Fig. 18f) were fabricated in a mixture containing ZnCl2/SnCl4/SDBS/tetraethylammonium hydroxide (TBAH)/ethanol/water under hydrothermal conditions.59,60 The formation process was similar to that occurring in the report on the hexagonal nanoplate-textured micro-octahedral Zn2SnO4, as shown in Fig. 18c.59
Significantly, polyhedral Zn2SnO4 with different morphologies were synthesized by a low temperature hydrothermal method in the presence of various alkaline mineralizers. A schematic illustration of the shape-evolution in different mineralizers is shown in Fig. 18g.61 It can be clearly seen that irregular Zn2SnO4 nanoparticles were formed in the presence of triethylamine (TEA), while cubic products were synthesized with the assistance of hydrazine hydrate (HH). And both of the above products were cubic-phase structures. Moreover, when different surfactant was added to the reaction system containing Zn(CH3COO)2/SnCl4/TBAH solution, morphologies from octahedral to cubic forms were achieved. This was because ionic surfactants could adsorb more strongly on the polar surfaces than those on the neutral surfaces because of the electrostatic interactions. As demonstrated, the {111} surface energy can be reduced by either cationic or anionic surfactants.55 So the introduction of ionic surfactants, including CTAB or SDBS, could lead to appearance of {111} surface, and finally formation of octahedral Zn2SnO4. As a result, it was concluded that the morphology of Zn2SnO4, such as cube, cuboctahedron, truncated octahedron, and octahedron, can be effectively controlled by adjusting the type and concentration of alkaline mineralizers and surfactants.61 Additionally, morphologies including cubes and octahedra have been synthesized in a ZnCl2/SnCl2/citric acid monohydrate/ethanol/water solution under hydrothermal conditions by tuning the reaction time.62
Additionally, the molten salt method is also effective in synthesis of polyhedral Zn2SnO4. Typically, molten salt acting as a solvent is different from the common solvents, which can be used to dissolve all the solid particles of oxides and precipitate the products from a homogeneous liquid phase. A general synthetic procedure is as follows. A eutectic mixture of molten salt and reactant powder was heated above the melting point of eutectic composition of molten salt. When the molten salt began to melt, the products began to generate. Subsequently, the solid products were cooled down to room temperature and salt was removed by washing with a suitable solvent of salt followed by drying. For example, inverse cubic spinel Zn2SnO4 with regular octahedral morphology were prepared at about 900 °C in a KCl–ZnCl2 salt system, in which the molten salt constituent had a significant influence on the final products.52 Compared with the conventional solid-phase reaction route, the reaction temperature decreased more than 200 °C. The formation of octahedron Zn2SnO4 can be attributed to the ‘dissolution–diffusion–crystallization–dissolution–recrystallization’ mechanism.
Hierarchical Zn2SnO4. 
Controllable synthesis of 3D hierarchical Zn2SnO4 with highly active building blocks could improve performance and expand potential applications. Multi-pod hierarchical Zn2SnO4 nanoflowers with nanorod building blocks (see Fig. 19a) can be successfully synthesized by a simple one-step hydrothermal method, in which a mixture of Zn(NO3)2/SnCl4/urea/CATB is used.63 Similarly, urchin-like hierarchical Zn2SnO4 with nanowire building blocks (see Fig. 19b) were synthesized by hydrothermally treating a mixed solution of Zn(CH3COO)2/SnCl4/ethylenediamine (EDA)/CATB at 180 °C.64 A possible mechanism was proposed for formation of hierarchical urchin-like nanostructures based on the time-dependent experiments and corresponding chemical composition analyses. Initially, EDA reacted with Zn2+ to form [Zn(en)3]2+ complexes because of its N-chelation function. Then, Zn2SnO4 nuclei were formed through the reaction between [Zn(en)3]2+ and Na2SnO3 in the presence of CTAB under hydrothermal conditions, which rapidly aggregate into irregular particles driven by minimization of the total energy of the system. Along with the reaction time increase, the irregular particles began to partly dissolve and recrystallize to generate nanowires on their surfaces by oriented aggregation in the presence of CTAB. These nanowire building blocks subsequently assembled into urchin-like nanostructures in a tip–tip growth manner by the interaction of CTAB. Finally, well-dispersed nanoflowers were formed through integration of Oswald ripening and self-assembly. However, hierarchical flower-like Zn2SnO4 with 2D building blocks (see Fig. 19c) were prepared in a surfactant-free hydrothermal condition using the precursor solution of ZnCl2/SnCl2/NaOH at 220 °C.65 Additionally, hierarchically structured Zn2SnO4 nanobeads (see Fig. 19d) were synthesized by hydrothermally heating a mixed solution of Zn(CH3COO)2/SnCl4/(CH3)4NOH at 220 °C.66 Notably, as for the surfactant-free synthesis of hierarchical Zn2SnO4, both the higher reaction temperature and excessive alkaline mineralizers are crucial factors in determining final morphologies.

Hollow Zn2SnO4. 
The synthetic strategies of hollow Zn2SnO4 architectures are similar to those reported for ZnSnO3 hollow architectures. The acid- or basic-etching agent is also effective for preparing the hollow products.
For example, octahedral Zn2SnO4 solids can be converted into hollow structures (see Fig. 20a) by adding them to a nitride acid solution under ultrasonic treatment.38 Hollow cubic Zn2SnO4 (see Fig. 20b) were fabricated by one-pot hydrothermal heating of a mixture of ZnCl2/citric acid/SnCl4/NaOH/ethanol/water, in which the citric acid was important for synthesis of the final hollow architectures.67

(f) Zn2SnO4 hollow nanospheres synthesized using PS templates. Reprinted with permission from ref. 71. Copyright RSC 2013. 
An alkaline etching method can be also used to achieve the formation of hollow Zn2SnO4 architectures. A typical synthetic strategy is shown as follows: (i) synthesis of solid ZnSn(OH)6 by co-precipitation of ZnCl2/SnCl4/NaOH at room temperature; (ii) synthesis of hollow ZnSn(OH)6 using an NaOH etching agent; (iii) transformation of hollow ZnSn(OH)6 to hollow Zn2SnO4 after heating at 700 °C under an argon atmosphere. A typical SEM image of the hollow Zn2SnO4 boxes is given in Fig. 20c.68 As a result, controllable synthesis of hollow Zn2SnO4 boxes can be well-tuned by adjusting the features of the ZnSn(OH)6 precursors. For instance, hierarchical ZnSn(OH)6 hollow nanospheres were synthesized in a Zn(CH3COO)2/Na2SnO3/PAA/ammonia system, subsequent formation of hierarchical Zn2SnO4 hollow nanospheres (see Fig. 20d) can be achieved by annealing the as-synthesized ZnSn(OH)6 precursors.69 Moreover, ZnO nanowires and polystyrene spheres (PS) acting as hard templates have been employed in synthesizing hollow Zn2SnO4. The characterizations of Zn2SnO4 nanotubes and half-bowls are shown in Fig. 20e and f, respectively.70,71 Thus it is believed that novel hollow Zn2SnO4 could be generated using various hard templates, but this is still in its infancy.
Based on the above overview, the controllable synthesis of diversified ZTO micro-/nanostructures is an exciting direction to pursue high-performance, and also provides an opportunity to investigate the structure–property–performance relationship. However, it should be noted that a series of hybrid ZTO-based heterogeneous architectures with well-controlled compositions, morphologies and sizes have been rationally designed and synthesized along with the rapid advances in nanomaterials science and nanotechnology.103–150

4. Applications
ZTO micro/nanostructures with controllable morphologies, crystalline-phases and mono-dispersed sizes would have broadened applications. In particular, the crystalline-phase is a crucial factor for application in energy harvesting. Furthermore, optimization of interfacial atomic structures/or electronic structures of ZTO-based composites would further enhance performances. This section highlights the typical applications of morphological ZTO micro/nanostructures in the fields of catalysts, sensors, lithium-ion batteries, nanodevices, solar cells, and chemical templates.
4.1 Catalysts
As low-cost and environmentally friendly semiconductor materials, ZTO micro/nanostructures have been developed in different catalytic applications. For example, ZnSnO3 acting as catalysts can be used in the fields of organic synthesis, fuel cells, and photocatalysis. Zn2SnO4 mainly serves as a photocatalyst in the fields of photodegradation dye, photocatalytic hydrogen (H2) generation, photoreduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) and photocatalytic removal of gaseous pollutant. Herein, different ZTO catalysts are detailed.

4.1.1 ZnSnO3 catalyst. 
Ultra-small ZnSnO3 catalysts can be used in synthesis of cyclic carbonates from epoxides and CO2 under atmospheric pressure,151 which bear acid–base sites derived through the formation of framework Zn–O–Sn bonds. This catalyst smoothly catalyzes a wide range of reactants to generate a series of cyclic carbonates under atmospheric pressure of CO2 and in the presence of PEG-600 solvent, exhibit high selectivity, recyclability and high yield. In particular, the catalyst can be easily recovered from the reaction medium and reused without strong loss in catalytic activity and selectivity, indicating its potential in the clean-up of the environment.
Hollow polyhedral ZnSnO3 (see Fig. 9a) has been used as a highly efficient support for Pt-based alkaline direct methanol fuel cell catalysts. When ultrafine Pt nanoparticles were anchored on the inner and outside surfaces of the hollow ZnSnO3, the electrons could easily get across the modified electrode, to promote the redox reaction. Cyclic voltammograms suggested that hollow polyhedral Pt/ZnSnO3 composite displayed a bigger effective catalytic area than that of Pt/XC-72 carbon composite. A very big discrepancy of oxidation current density indicates that the hollow polyhedral Pt/ZnSnO3 catalyst can effectively prevent catalyst poisoning. The oxidation current has been normalized to the electroactive Pt surface area calculated from the charges of hydrogen adsorption and desorption, and it was determined that the current density was over five times that of the commercial Pt/C sample.43
Hollow ZnSnO3 nanospheres/rGO nanocomposites can act as photocatalyst in degradation of pharmaceutical waste water, displaying good photodegradation of metronidazole-contained aqueous solutions under visible-light irradiation. It was noted that the degradation efficiencies of metronidazole under visible light irradiation (duration: 180 min) using the hollow ZnSnO3 nanospheres and ZnSnO3/rGO nanocomposites reach 42.1% and 72.5%, respectively, while the pure rGO and ZnSnO3–rGO physical mixtures showed extremely poor photodegradation performances. The superior visible-light-driven photocatalytic activity of ZnSnO3/rGO was attributed to the advanced adsorption efficiency of molecules, the improved visible light absorption, and the unique electronic structure of the hybrid nanocomposite with the presence of rGO.44
Importantly, a novel piezophotocatalyst was designed and investigated using high purity and highly aligned LN-type ZnSnO3 nanowires.15 ZnSnO3 nanowires can be bent to generate piezoelectric voltages. This piezopotential can be used to tailor the separation and migration/or recombination of charge carriers under illumination at the semiconductor–solution interface to photodegrade organic pollutants. Thus, the piezophotocatalyst can possess a better photocatalytic activity than that of the normal photocatalyst. The enhancement can be attributed to coupling of the functions of piezophototronics (including semiconductor, piezoelectricity, and photonics) and photocatalysis for achieving the synergistic catalytic effect, which will reduce the recombination of photogenerated electron–hole pairs and increase the mobility of these pairs resulting from the energy band distortion caused by applied stresses.


4.1.2 Zn2SnO4 catalyst. 
In the past decade Zn2SnO4 photocatalyst has drawn attention in photocatalytic oxidization of pollutant and organic molecules, photocatalytic water splitting, and photocatalytic reduction of CO2.55,58,133,152–158
The change of the absorption peak during the photodegradation of methylene orange (MO) in the presence of Zn2SnO4 nanoparticles suggests that Zn2SnO4 nanoparticles can achieve degradation of MO under light irradiation, and that the stability is good.154 The time course of photocatalytic H2 production from ethanol solution over commercial P25 and the above Zn2SnO4 nanoparticles indicate that Zn2SnO4 is better than the commercial P25.154 An attempt to enhance the efficiency of Zn2SnO4 nanoparticles was made by decorating Pt co-catalyst. The H2 evolution rates over Zn2SnO4 nanoparticles and Pt-modified Zn2SnO4 were much higher than those of P25. The H2 evolution rate increased more rapidly than the un-pre-stirred sample and required only 2.5 h to reach a constant rate of 0.231 mmol h−1. So Pt-modified Zn2SnO4 shows much higher activity than P25 for photocatalytic production of H2 from ethanol solution. Moreover, nanoplate/micro-octahedral Zn2SnO4 (see Fig. 18c) was also demonstrated to strongly enhance the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 into renewable hydrocarbon fuel (methane, CH4) in the presence of water vapor. The nanoplate/micro-octahedral Zn2SnO4 can exclusively generate a yield of CH4 of about 20.1 ppm g−1 in the first hour under light illumination, which is much higher than bulky (1.5 ppm g−1), atactic-particle (2.4 ppm g−1), and smooth micro-octahedron Zn2SnO4 (4.7 ppm g−1). The generation rate of CH4 could be increased to 86.7 ppm g−1 by loading of Pt and RuO2 as co-catalysts onto nanoplate/micro-octahedral Zn2SnO4, which help by collecting photogenerated electrons and holes, respectively.55 In addition, Zn2SnO4 microcube demonstrated improved activity for photocatalytic degradation of NO and formaldehyde (HCHO) gas under UV-vis light irradiation over those of the pristine ZnO and SnO2.58
Undoubtedly, the rapid recombination rate of photogenerated charge carrier in a photocatalyst would lower the quantum efficiency, thereby restraining practical applications. Hybrid ZTO-based micro/nanostructures have attracted wide research interest because they might potentially promote separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs.111,115,127,128,133,147

4.2 Gas sensing
Gas-sensing materials have been extensively investigated in recent decades with a view to detecting toxic gas, which has relevance to the chemical industry, environmental protection, public safety, and human health. Gas sensors based on n-type semiconductors (including ZnO and SnO2) have been employed for detection of inflammable or toxic gases, such as H2, CH4, C2H5OH, CO or liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). However, lack of selectivity a major disadvantage. n-Type ZTO semiconductor are good candidates to improve selectivity of sensors to different gases. When the ZTO is exposed to air, oxygen is adsorbed onto its surface. The adsorbed oxygen molecules capture free electrons from the conduction band of ZTO to form chemisorbed oxygen species (O2−, O22− and O−) in the air because of the strong electronegativity, thereby increasing the resistivity of the sensing element. When ZTO is exposed to ethanol or other reductive gases, the gas molecules can react with adsorbed oxygen species on the surface of ZTO, resulting in increased resistance. Therefore, the exposed surface, size, phase, specific surface area and heterogeneous interface of the ZTO have important roles in contact and subsequent reaction of oxygen species with the tested gas.
A typical schematic structure of gas sensor is as follows.159,160 First, the as-prepared samples were mixed with appropriate amounts of deionized water, and the above sensing paste was deposited onto a ceramic tube with two Au electrodes. Subsequently, a wired Ni–Cr heater was put into the center of the ceramic tube to generate an indirect-heated gas sensor.159 The different operating temperature of the sensor was obtained by adjusting the heating current of the gas-sensing test system. Finally, gas sensing was achieved after aging at certain relative current with a stable voltage for a long time for perfection of durability and stability.

4.2.1 ZnSnO3 sensor. 
ZnSnO3 has been investigated as an excellent gas-sensitive material for detecting reducing and combustible gases. A polyhedral ZnSnO3-based gas sensor exhibits high sensitivity, short recovery time, and good reproducibility to HCHO gas.37 The 14-faceted polyhedral ZnSnO3 exposed with six {100} facets and eight {111} facets possesses greater sensitivity than the octahedral one and the commercial powder because of their more exposed active {100} facets. Thus it is proposed that cubic ZnSnO3 wholly exposed with {100} facets will be suitable for gas sensing. Yu and coworkers demonstrated that cubic ZnSnO3 with an average diameter of 40 nm had obvious selectivity of reducing gas, especially for sensing of HCHO gas.39
Moreover, the crystalline phase of ZnSnO3 may determine the gas sensing property. Both gas sensors based on orth-ZnSnO3 and fcc-ZnSnO3 are highly sensitive to ethanol with fast response and recovery, and good selectivity as well as stability, and the sensitivity of the orth-ZnSnO3 is much higher than that of the fcc-ZnSnO3.41 The rapid gas diffusion onto the entire sensing surface mean that 2D ZnSnO3 nanosheets realize not only high sensitivity but also ultra-fast response and recovery. When exposed to ethanol and acetone, response rates are as fast as 0.36 s and 0.18 s, respectively.34 Compared with the reaction of acetone molecules, the interaction between oxygen species and ethanol molecules possesses more intermediate steps, which is attributed to differing chemical properties between acetone and ethanol, suggesting that the response and recovery to acetone are faster than those to ethanol. ZnSnO3 nanocages and microcubes have good selectivity for H2S and H2 gas, respectively.49,161
Furthermore, hybrid ZnSnO3-based composites can generate novel interfacial atomic structures, which will further improve the separation and migration of free electrons, limiting recombination of the electron–hole pairs. Therefore, the selectivity of ZnSnO3-based gas sensor is obviously optimized. The SnO2/ZnSnO3 sensor displays small responses to acetone and formaldehyde, and is almost insensitive to methanol, butanone, xylene, and chloroform. The highest response of the sensor is 36.5 to ethanol, whereas the responses to other gases are no larger than 12. Based on these results, it is concluded that sensor is more than twice as selective to ethanol against other volatile organic compound gases.108 Interestingly, ZnO/ZnSnO3 composite exhibits better selectivity for detecting LPG gas than other inflammable or toxic gases.107 Introduction of noble metal nanoparticles onto sensing materials can also change the selectivity for detecting gases. For example, an Au-doped mixture of ZnO/ZnSnO3 possesses a higher response for detecting formaldehyde, whereas the un-doped version displays good selectivity for H2S.162 In addition, the response of PPy/ZnSnO3 nanocomposite is much higher than that of PPY toward ammonia gas, because of synergic interaction between intimately contacted p-type PPy semiconductor and n-type ZnSnO3 semiconductor. The p-type PPy can act as an electron donor and n-type ZnSnO3 is an electron acceptor, thus a p–n junction formed in the donor–acceptor system could enhance the depletion battier height, resulting in an increased response.161


4.2.2 Zn2SnO4 sensor. 
Sensitivity and selectivity of Zn2SnO4 sensors have also been reported. For instance, polyhedral Zn2SnO4 shows good selectivity for triethylamine (TEA) and the octahedral version displays a higher response than those of the cubic ones.62 Therefore, octahedral Zn2SnO4 wholly exposed with {111} facets is suitable for gas sensing, which is opposite to that occurring seen with ZnSnO3. Moreover, Zn2SnO4 with a highly porous structure can show higher sensing performance than that of Zn2SnO4 with a dense structure. Porous Zn2SnO4 fiber exhibits approximately 4-fold higher C2H5OH sensitivity compared with the dense sensor. And, remarkably high selectivity for C2H5OH against CO and H2 gases is seen in both porous and dense Zn2SnO4 fibers.32 A stable aqueous suspension of Zn2SnO4 QDs can be used for ink-jet printing of functional devices, and shows a linear relation with increasing humidity concentration, indicating that the material is suitable for humidity sensing.10 Additionally, ultraviolet photodetectors based on an individual Zn2SnO4 single crystalline nanowire have been fabricated, which exhibit high performances, such as high “ON/OFF” current ratio, high response speed and excellent device stability.30 Notably, the interfacial chemistry of the Zn2SnO4-based sensor remains controversial and requires further investigation.

4.3 Anode for lithium-ion battery
ZTO has been used as an electrode for lithium-ion batteries, and exhibits a large charge–discharge capacity. The theoretical capacities of ZnSnO3 and Zn2SnO4 are 1320 and 1494 mA h g−1, respectively.35,167 However, the cycling performance of such material is poor because of volume expansion and agglomeration during the charge–discharge process. To overcome this drawback and improve the electrochemical activity, much effort has been employed to develop novel electrodes with outstanding performances such as shorter ion diffusion, and larger contact areas between the electrode and electrolyte. It has been found that Zn2SnO4 hollow cages and nanowires have a relatively better reversible capacity after long cycle tests.18,69 Binary-component ZTO-based composites can integrate the two functional materials and display a strong synergistic effect, which will improve the intrinsic properties of each component such as electrical/ionic conductivity, electrochemical reactivity, and mechanical stability. For example, C/Zn2SnO4 composite exhibited a reversible capacity of 770 mA h g−1 under a current density of 1000 mA g−1 after the 120th cycle.140 While the sandwich-like C/ZnSnO3 composite possessed a reversible capacity of 1107 mA h g−1 under a current density of 100 mA g−1 after the 200th cycle,175 which is better than that of pristine ZnSnO3. In this case, the enhanced Li storage activity of the above mentioned sandwich-like C/ZnSnO3 composite can be attributed to the special nanostructure. First, the interconnected and porous carbon nanoplates enhance free diffusion of electrolyte/ions and the electron conductivity of the electrode. Second, because the ZnSnO3 nanoparticles are encapsulated inside the thin carbon nanosheets, detachment can be largely avoided during the continuous electrochemical cycling reaction. Moreover, the nanoscale ZnSnO3 particles (20–50 nm) with high specific surface area promote the Li-ion exchange rate and allow some volume change of the shells during electrochemical reactions. The whole electrochemical reaction process can be described as follows.175 Zn + xLi+ + xe− ↔ LixZn, x ≤ 1(9) C + yLi+ + ye− ↔ LiyC(10) Sn + zLi+ + ze− ↔ LizSn, 0 ≤ z ≤ 4.4(11) 4Li+ + ZnSnO3 + 4e− → Sn + 2Li2O + ZnO(12) 6Li+ + ZnSnO3 + 6e− → Sn + 3Li2O + Zn(13)
Detailed information on the ZTO anode for lithium-ion batteries is given in Table 2.18,35,57,68,69,105,120,137,138,140–145,162–176 It can be predicted that special microstructures of anode materials, including porous 1D,177 hollow nanostructures,178,179 and hybrid carbon-based nanocomposites,180,181 are promising candidates for enhancing lithium storage. However, the current evaluating system between the anode material and charge–discharge capacity requires further optimization.

4.4 Nanodevice
Theoretically, a high spontaneous polarization of ≈59 μC cm−2 can be obtained along the c-axis of the structurally ordered LN-type ZnSnO3 crystal. Therefore, LN-type ZnSnO3 is a highly promising material for lead-free piezoelectric energy harvesting. Wang and coworkers demonstrated a lead-free nanogenerator made with a ZnSnO3 microbelt that generated output power of ≈3 nW under a compressive and releasing strain of 0.8–1.0%. An individual ZnSnO3 microbelt is bonded at its ends on a flexible polystyrene substrate as a nanogenerator, displaying an output voltage and current of 100 mV and 30 nA, respectively, corresponding to an energy conversion efficiency of 4.2–6.6% (based on 0.8–1% strain).11 Moreover, a ZnSnO3 triangular-belt has also been used as a lead-free nanogenerator, which generated a current and voltage of 0.13 μA and 5.3 V, respectively, by introducing a mechanical deformation of ≈0.1%. This is a novel discovery because it is the first exhibition of high output power from a lead-free ZnSnO3 nanogenerator.13 Similarly, a flexible strain sensor based on rhombohedral ZnSnO3 nanowires/microwires with [001] axis was made for the first time by Wang's group.12 This strain sensors possessed ultrahigh sensitivity, which was attributed to the piezopotential-modulated change in Schottky barrier height. The on/off ratio of this device is ≈587, and a gauge factor of 3740 has been shown, which is 19 times higher than that of Si and three times higher than those of carbon nanotubes and ZnO nanowires. The first evidence of superior ferroelectric properties from these ZnSnO3 nanowire arrays was demonstrated by Datta and coworkers, which has a remanent polarization value as high as ≈30 μC cm−2. This offers valuable information in terms of a new pathway for coherent design of ZnSnO3-based ferroelectric devices.16 Additionally, single-crystalline piezoelectric perovskite ZnSnO3 nanocubes are important for constructing hybrid piezoelectric nanogenerators (HP-NG). Lee and coworkers reported an extremely stable high-power generation through a HP-NG by integrating ZnSnO3 nanocubes and polydimethylsiloxane without any electrical poling treatment.182 The HP-NGs of ZnSnO3 nanocubes exhibited high mechanical durability, excellent robustness, and high power-generation performance. A large recordable output voltage of about 20 V and an output current density of about 1 μA cm−2 were successfully obtained.
4.5 Solar cell
As an n-type transparent conductive semiconductor, Zn2SnO4 with a small electron effective mass of 0.23me and a high-electron Hall mobility of 10–15 cm2 V−1 s−1, is well-known in the field of optoelectronics.109 Moreover, it has a wide optical band gap of 3.6–3.8 eV and a relatively low refractive index of ≈2.0 in the visible spectrum.147,183 Importantly, the conduction band edge position, similar to that of TiO2 and ZnO, makes it an effective photoelectrode component in emerging solar cells, such as the dye sensitized solar cell (DSSC) and perovskite solar cell (PSC).184,185 In addition, the most attractive attribute of Zn2SnO4 nanocrystal is its chemical stability with respect to acid/base solutions and polar organic solvents.186,187 However, there are few investigations of ZnSnO3 in solar cells so far. Therefore, this subsection gives an overview of application of Zn2SnO4 in solar cells, including DSSC and PSC.

4.5.1 DSSC. 
Tailoring the morphology, porosity as well as size of Zn2SnO4/or hybrid ZnSnO4, may enhance photovoltaic performance. DSSC based on hierarchical 2D Zn2SnO4 nanosheets (see Fig. 17) photoelectrode exhibited a remarkable improvement in power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 4.82% compared with that of nanoparticles (4.01%) with N719 dye because of its superior light scattering ability, faster electron transport rate and slower charger combination rate. Furthermore, it was found that TiCl4 treatment of 2D Zn2SnO4 nanosheets photoelectrode can lead to an impressive photovoltaic performance of 5.44%, which can be ascribed to reduction of electron back transfer from Zn2SnO4 nanosheets to the redox electrolyte.36 Macroporous Zn2SnO4-based double layered photoelectrodes can also show remarkable enhancement in PCE (6.10%) compared with that of Zn2SnO4 nanoparticles photoelectrode.71 Hong and coworkers achieved a noticeable efficiency of 4.7% for DSSC using Zn2SnO4 nanoparticles with an average diameter of ∼8 nm, which can be attributed to superior N719 dye adsorption ability of the ultrafine and uniform nanoparticles.8 Similarly, Wei and coworkers found that Zn2SnO4 QDs deposited onto the surface of the ZnO photoanode by a chemical-bath deposition induce an obvious performance enhancement of dye-sensitized ZnO solar cell.188 In addition, SnO2/Zn2SnO4 hollow spheres have good efficiency of 4.52%, which is much higher than those reported for SnO2 (1.2%), and commercial Zn2SnO4/SnO2 mixtures (1.49%), because the in situ hybridization of Zn2SnO4 and SnO2 in Zn2SnO4/SnO2 hollow spheres is beneficial for electron migration and light scattering.112
Besides the morphology, size, porosity and hybridizing of the Zn2SnO4 photoelectrode, the species of dyes can also affect the PEC of DSSCs. Unique morphology of the Zn2SnO4 can allow for enhancements in dye absorption, light scattering, electrolyte penetration, and charge recombination lifetime, while the organic dyes lead to the high molar absorbability. By coupling novel morphological Zn2SnO4 with the proper dyes, excellent DSSCs can be designed and synthesized. For example, DSSC based on hierarchically structured Zn2SnO4 nanobeads and organic dyes (SJ-E1 and SJ-ET1) displayed the highest performance ever reported for DSSCs with ternary metal oxide-based photoelectrodes, which possessed a power conversion efficiency of 6.3%. This was much higher than that of conventional Zn2SnO4-nanoparticle-based photoelectrodes or that based on the popular ruthenium-based dye, N719.66 Detailed information on Zn2SnO4-based DSSCs is given in Table 3.8,25,36,66,71,112,188–191 Considering that the enhanced performances of DSSCs are generated using films of relatively low thicknesses, the results indicate that the proposed fabrication technique could be used for preparing novel solid-state and/or flexible DSSCs.

4.5.2 PSC. 
In 2015, Seok and coworkers demonstrated a high-performance flexible PSC comprising a polyethylene naphthalate/indium-doped tin oxide (PEN/ITO) substrate, a low-temperature solution-processed highly dispersed Zn2SnO4 nanoparticle layer, a perovskite methyl ammonium lead halide (CH3NH3PbI3) layer, a poly(triarylamine) hole conductor layer and Au layer as the electrode.192 The introduction of Zn2SnO4 film significantly enhanced transmittance of flexible polyethylene naphthalate/indium-doped tin oxide (PEN/ITO)-coated substrate from 75% to 90% in the visible region. The best performing flexible PSC, based on Zn2SnO4 and CH3NH3PbI3 layer, displayed a steady-state PCE of 14.85% and a high-quantum efficiency exceeding 15% under AM 1.5G 100 mW cm−2 illumination. To the best of our knowledge, this PCE is the highest performance reported for flexible PSCs using metal oxide electrodes.193–195
Wu and coworkers developed an efficient mixed-halide PSC with negligible hysteresis in the J–V curve and high stability using spinel-structured Zn2SnO4 as the electron transport layer.196 The presence of the Zn2SnO4 layer can accelerate crystallization of the perovskite layer, and subsequently a bilayer structure of perovskite with uniform and full surface coverage can be prepared by a facile one-step spin-coating technique. Such a PSC device possessed an energy conversion efficiency of 13.34%, much higher than that achieved with the commonly used TiO2 under similar experimental conditions.196
Highly porous Zn2SnO4 scaffold nanofibers have been synthesized by an electrospinning technique and successfully used for PSC. The fabricated optimized PSC device exhibited a PCE of 7.38% with open circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.986 V, current density (JSC) 12.68 mA cm−2 and fill factor (FF) 0.59 under AM 1.5G 100 mW cm−2 illumination, in which the high porosity and high crystallinity of the Zn2SnO4 nanofibers were crucial.133 Additionally, in a similar PSC system, Kim and coworkers found that a device with a 300 nm thick mesoscopic Zn2SnO4 layer showed a PCE of 7%.185
Based on the above examples, Zn2SnO4 is a promising electron transport layer for fabricating highly efficient flexible PSCs, and interface engineering of this system should be further exploited in future to optimize the device performance.

4.6 Chemical template
The transformation of ternary Zn2SnO4 into binary semiconductor oxide (SnO2) and sulfide (SnS2) has been explored, in which Zn2SnO4 can act as a template.54 In a typical synthesis, octahedral Zn2SnO4 templates were first synthesized by hydrothermally heating a mixed solution of Zn(CH3COO)2/Na2SnO3/NaOH, and the products were washed by dilute hydrochloric acid, deionized water and absolute ethanol several times. Then octahedral Zn2SnO4 templates reacted with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (H4EDTA) under hydrothermal conditions, thus mesoporous binary SnO2 hierarchical octahedra assembled from nanoparticles were synthesized through selective extraction of Zn2+ ions in Zn2SnO4 by H4EDTA and subsequent Ostwald ripening. Further, transformation of octahedral Zn2SnO4 into hollow SnS2 hierarchical octahedra assembled from nanosheets was achieved through additional introduction of thioacetamide (TAA) as a sulfur source in the chemical transformation reaction from Zn2SnO4 to SnO2.
The chemical conversion pathways of octahedral Zn2SnO4 solids to hierarchical SnO2 and SnS2 octahedra are described as follows.54 When Zn2SnO4 reacts with H4EDTA, Zn2+ ions can be immediately extracted from Zn2SnO4 and lead to formation of the Zn–H2EDTA complex because of strong coordination between H4EDTA and Zn2+ ions. Meanwhile, the Zn2SnO4 template containing Sn4+ ions rapidly protonates and dehydrates under the acid conditions, and finally results in formation of SnO2 according to eqn (14). During this conversion process, the nucleation and growth of SnO2 would preferentially proceed on the octahedral templates, and these SnO2 nanoparticles can closely stack together to minimize the surface energies. Finally, hierarchical octahedra assembled from SnO2 nanoparticles are produced based on Ostwald ripening. Similarly, the remaining SnO44− ions stripped from Zn2SnO4 can react with H2S derived from the decomposition of TTA at the initial reaction stage (eqn (15) and (16)). Thus SnS2 nucleated and anisotropically grow in the consuming of the Zn2SnO4 template. Hollow hierarchical SnS2 octahedra assembled from nanosheets are produced by Ostwald ripening. Furthermore, this strategy can be extended to synthesis of Bi2O3 nanotubes from Bi2CuO4 nanorods through selective extraction of Cu2+ ions in Bi2CuO4. However, application of ZnSnO3 templates based on the above mentioned method has not been reported. Zn2SnO4 + 2H4EDTA → 2Zn(H2EDTA) + SnO2 + 2H2O(14) TTA → H2S + byproducts(15) Zn2SnO4 + 2H4EDTA + 2H2S → 2Zn(H2EDTA) + SnS2 + 4H2O(16)
5. Conclusions and perspective
ZTO (ZnSnO3 and Zn2SnO4) micro/nanostructures with controllable crystalline-phases, sizes and morphologies have been widely investigated because of their high electron mobility, high electrical conductivity, attractive optical properties and good stability compared with their binary counterparts (such as ZnO and SnO2). Herein, a comprehensive review is given of general synthesis strategies and growth mechanisms, morphological diversities, and current applications, for different types of ZTO micro/nanostructures. Progress in controllable synthesis of morphological ZTO micro/nanostructures provides a great opportunity for rational design and fabrication of high-performance ternary semiconductors as well as enrichment of their atomic/or electronic and interfacial properties. Despite enormous investigations and great achievements made in recent decades, as outlined in this review, there is still a long way ahead before ZTO can be comprehensively cognized and applied with economic benefit. To realize such an ambition, many tasks require special exploration in future.
In regard to synthesis of novel ZTO micro/nanostructures, an important task is to acknowledge the growth mechanisms and thereby manipulate the morphologies, crystalline-phases, monodispersity, surface/interfacial atomic arrangements and intrinsic electronic structures. As for 3D polyhedral ZTO nanostructure, introduction of highly active exposed facets, particularly high-index facets, is the top priority for enhancing chemical activity. However, the reported polyhedral ZTO micro/nanostructures were generally exposed with low-index {111} and {100} facets, which strongly limits investigation of the facet-dependent properties of ZTO. Therefore, efforts should be further employed to explore synthesis of novel ZTO architectures exposed with controllable-index facets with the aim of understanding the relationship between surface atomic structures and performances. Notably, the size-controlled synthesis of polyhedral ZTO, especially mono-dispersive nanoparticles of size below 100 nm, is an urgent task. As for 2D ZTO nanostructure, surfactant-free, large-scale controllable synthesis of ultrathin ZTO nanosheets remains a challenge because the formation mechanism is unclear, and application of 2D ZTO as supports for special catalytic reactions should be considered. As for 1D ZTO nanostructure, the purity of product is a bottleneck, thus new synthetic strategies based on hydrothermal approaches and template-assisted routes should be explored thoroughly. As for 0D ZTO nanostructure, although some references have focused on studies of Zn2SnO4 nanodots, both uniformity and mono-dispersity are not very well understood. Moreover, there are no reports of investigation of 0D ZnSnO3 nanostructure. Therefore, a facile and surfactant-free synthetic strategy is worth investigating in this field.
Significantly, development of ZTO mesocrystals wholly exposed with well-defined building blocks and porous surfaces can improve the number of active sites consisting of low-coordinated atoms in defect sites including terraces, edges, kinks, or vacancies for increasing their chemical activities. Porous/void surfaces can also enhance mass transfer and migration, and facilitate the practical reaction. However, the synthesis of meso-structural ZTO with useful building blocks is still in its infancy. Continuous effort is required to excite preparation of mesostructural ZTO with desired crystallographic facets. Rational selection of suitable capping agents for preparing targeted mesostructures according to the computer-assisted surface energy variations could accelerate synthesis of the targeted architectures. Furthermore, investigation of porous and hollow ZTO micro/nanostructures with high specific surface areas remains necessary through different strategies, including hard-template and soft-template routes. In addition, crystalline-phase controlled synthesis of ZTO, especially for ZnSnO3 nanostructure, is important in attempts obtain unique performance.
To maximize performances of ZTO micro/nanostructures, the functional modifications (including doping and hybridizing) should be developed thoroughly. For doped ZTO, the current achievement is less and limited, thereby it remains a challenge to achieve selective doping of heteroatoms for optimizing the electronic structures. Development of doped precursors, such as metal/or nonmetal-doped ZnSn(OH)6 precursors for annealing or doped source materials for thermal evaporation, could be an effective strategy for achieving controllable synthesis of doped-ZTO micro/nanostructures. For hybridized ZTO, decorating active components on specific facets of ZTO micro/nanostructures has attracted intensive attention, and identifying the facet-dependent interfacial properties remains the central task. Theoretical calculations on electronic structures of doped semiconductors and interfacial structures of hybridizing composites should be given in future studies.
Application of ZTO templates for fabrication of binary oxide or multicomponent heterogeneous nanostructures should be further highlighted. It is believed that a series of new hybrid architectures can be selectively designed and fabricated by a sacrificial ZTO-based template approach. Emphatically, ZnSnO3-based nanostructure is a promising candidate for application in the fields of sensing, nanodevices and Li-ion batteries, while the Zn2SnO4-based nanostructure is widely used in the fields of solar cells and photocatalysts. Therefore, the above mentioned applications of different types of ZTO materials should be taken into consideration.
Overall, this comprehensive and in-depth highlight of general synthesis strategies and growth mechanisms, the fundamental properties, and their potential applications, will promote the development of new function-oriented ZTO micro/nanostructures.
