    , Accepted 18th July 2017First published on 19th July 2017AbstractInexpensive nonprecious metal phosphides have been extensively investigated as catalysts over the past few years. This review summarizes the research on catalytic performance of nonprecious metal phosphides in three important reactions of fuel cells: hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Different components, morphologies, and supports of transition-metal phosphides have significant effects on their catalytic performances. Phosphides and their complexes as catalysts have higher performances and better stabilities compared with the commercial catalysts platinum (Pt) and iridium oxide (IrO2), and thus they are potential alternatives to commercial catalysts. Finally, future prospects for developmental trends with nonprecious metal phosphides are discussed.Y. LvY. Lv was born in 1989.

1. Introduction
Against the background of global warming and normalized energy crisis, energy issues have become crucial elements of national strategy security for countries across the globe.1–4 Tidal energy, nuclear energy, solar energy, and fuel cells have come into being.5–8 An effective solution is to include fuel cells technology, which provides green and sustainable energy.9,10 A fuel cell generates electrical power by electrochemical oxygen reduction and water is the only product.11 Owing to its great conversion efficiency, low environmental damage, and a potential for large-scale applications, this energy technology has attracted much attention and extensive research.12–14 However, fuel cells are in urgent need of efficient catalysts for HER, ORR, and OER.15–17 HER is a process for preparing H2 by electrolysis of water or H+, and ORR is an electrochemical reaction that reduces oxygen to HO2− or H2O, while OER is generalized to couple multiple proton and electron transfers to O2 evolution.18 In the past, Pt, Pt/C, and IrO2 have been used as conventional HER, ORR, and OER catalysts.19–22 Unfortunately, due to scarcity of resources and expensive prices, the above-mentioned catalysts limit large-scale commercial applications of fuel cells. While facing prohibitively high costs, those catalysts also suffer from other problems, including poor stability and carbon monoxide poisoning.23–25 Therefore, the objective of this research effort is to select existing, low cost catalysts, being comparable to or better than Pt or IrO2 for HER, ORR, and OER in fuel cells. In recent years, many non-noble-metal-based catalysts have been achieved, such as transition-metal sulfides, selenium compounds, and carbon-based composites. These catalysts have highly stable catalytic performance toward HER in an acidic environment, but only a few of them exhibit catalytic activity and stability in alkaline conditions, where hydrogen production by electrolysis is a trending industrial development.26 Transition metal chalcogenides (Co3S4, Co9S8, CoSe, FeS2, etc.), metal oxides (ZrO2, TiO2, SnO2, Nb2O5, etc.), and metal-free heteroatoms (N, B, P, and S) doped carbons have been actively explored for ORR and OER. Among them, great efforts have been devoted to catalysts based on transition metal nitrogen-coordinated (M–N4) complexes, but these species exhibit low catalytic efficiency and stability due to the loss of M–N4 coordination upon hydrolysis.27 However, phosphides have higher catalytic performances and great stabilities for ORR, OER, and HER. And, metals of phosphides are cheap. Moreover, phosphides have a circular use and good stability in catalytic processes and no adsorption causing CO poisoning. They have great potential to replace current commercial catalysts, and so have attracted recent attention of researchers.
Studies for efficient alternatives to replace or reduce Pt/IrO2 for HER, ORR, and OER in fuel cells began in the 1960s and have expanded year by year. The discovery of inexpensive nonprecious metal (INM) catalysts is having great progress in the field of fuel cells, and some of the INM catalysts reported in HER, ORR, and OER have comparable or even higher performances than Pt/IrO2.28–33 Although amounts of precious metals can be reduced by alloying, large-scale commercial productions still need to use a lot of precious metals. Moreover, the catalytic performance of many INM catalysts should be further improved to meet practical applications.34,35 The focus of this review is on the rise of INM catalysts in recent years, but the literature is not very comprehensive. Therefore, there will be no doubt that the examples to be presented in this paper are not representative of all INM catalysts. Readers who are interested in the noble and nonprecious metal HER, ORR, and OER catalysts can refer to several excellent review articles published recently. With the in-depth study of INM catalysts in recent years, a new class of phosphides were found as an alternative for HER, ORR, and OER catalysts, which might effectively reduce costs and improve the performances of fuel cells.36–40 In particular, cobalt phosphide nanowires (CoP NWs) can act as an INM electrode to catalyze ORR/HER processes with equal electrocatalytic activity and greater long-term operational stability than those of commercially available platinum/C electrodes (e.g., C2-20, 20% platinum on Vulcan XC-72R; and E-TEK) in fuel cells.41 Cobalt phosphide contains active sites of cobalt ions, phosphorus atoms, and Co–P bonds, of which all contribute to catalytic activity.42 Recent researches have confirmed the above findings and have large influences on the development of new INM catalytic materials, such as various metal/heteroatom-doped phosphides (M–CoP, M = Fe, Ni, etc.), graphene coated phosphide, and carbon-phosphide, with a good methanol and CO tolerance, excellent durability for fuel cells, and many other applications.36,43–45 These new results are enough to attract the attention of the world. Structure, atomic ratio, load, and doping source of phosphides have important effects on their catalytic efficiency for HER, ORR, and OER half reaction in fuel cells.
2. Phosphide nanomaterials
Phosphide is known to exist in many forms, but phosphides with catalytic properties are mainly cobalt phosphide, nickel phosphide, iron phosphide, and their binary or ternary mixtures.46,47 Moreover, different atomic ratios also correspond to different morphologies, structures, and properties.46,48 Morphologies of nanomaterials are primarily composed of nanorods (NRs), nanowires (NWs), nanosheets (NSs), nanoparticles (NPs), and nanocrystals (NCs).36,41,47,50,51 For synthesizing nanostructured metal phosphides, hydrothermal treatment and a template method are used as major preparation methods to achieve INM precursors. These are followed by phosphorization with NaH2PO2 at low temperatures to obtain phosphides. A small number of phosphides are synthesized by oil bath heating, or high temperature annealing. Nanostructures of phosphides depend on reaction temperatures, times, chemicals, template types or supporters such as porous carbon, graphene, and carbon cloth (CC).
2.1 Cobalt phosphide nanomaterials
Cobalt phosphides as catalysts often exist in the forms of CoP, Co2P, and CoxP (x = 1–2).43,46,49 For example, Yuan et al. prepared CoP NPs with three-dimensional hierarchical nanoporous carbons (BMHNC).36 First, CaCO3 nanoparticles as templates were separated from cinnamomum platyphyllum, then homogeneously mixed. Second, followed by carbonation, a template was removed to generate CoP precursor nanoparticles in a carbon frame. Finally, phosphating treatment in a low temperature environment, CoP NPs composite 3D-BMHNC were prepared; this was a 3D porous structure with pore sizes ranging from 10 to 100 nm. Large macro-pore sizes ranged from 12–70 nm, and mesopores sizes from 3–5 nm. Before and after loading CoP, the structure was basically unchanged, indicating that this structure is sufficient to bear CoP precursors in the phosphating process. Additionally, the CoP particles were very uniformly dispersed on the BMHNC surface, proving that CoP was successfully loaded on the BMHNC.
Another urchin-like CoP NCs51 was prepared from Co(NO3)2 and urea by a hydrothermal reaction; 12 h under 120 °C, and phosphorization with Na2H2PO2 in N2, as shown in Fig. 1. The photographs show that it's CoP with a size in micrometers, and the microstructure is sea urchin-like nanocrystals. There are large numbers of pores and vesicles in the tops of CoP NCs. Reducing the amount of urea generates nanowire precursors. If the reaction time is less than 90 minutes, there will be no precipitate, and the sediment size gradually increases to 5 micrometers with increasing reaction time.

The highlighted 2.84 Å lattice fringe corresponds to the (011) plane of CoP NCs. Reprinted with permission from ref. 51. Copyright 2015 American Chemical Society. 
Single-crystalline CoP NWs52 could be obtained from hexadecylamine (HDA), trioctylphosphine oxide (TOPO), Co(acac)2 and tetradecylphosphonic acid (TDPA). Black CoP NWs were collected by washing with ethanol and drying for several hours. Large numbers of single-crystal nanowires were generated with their lengths ranging from 100–200 nm. In another work, Chang et al. showed that surface oxidized CoP NRs40 were phosphided from Co3O4 precursors obtained by a hydrothermal reaction. The NPs had about a 25 nm particle size and a thin layer coated them. The crystal plane spacing in the (011) direction is 0.283 nm, and the distance in the (111) direction is 0.246 nm, as shown in Fig. 2.

In different works, Juan et al. fabricated nanostructured Co2P by some changes of conditions.49 Controlling the reaction temperature, the products of CoP and Co2P were obtained over 330 °C and 290 °C, respectively. The average diameters of the Co2P NPs were 9–13 nm, and the diameters of CoP NPs were 10–14 nm. Moreover, Co2P NRs50 with diameters of 1.9–3.7 nm and lengths of 8.9–15.9 nm, and where the NRs grew along a (020) direction, had been developed by Vicky et al. The spacing of the (111) planes was 0.27 nm, and the angle of (011) planes and (020) planes was 39.2°.
Self-supported NRs CoP NWs arrays53 were prepared with CC as a substrate, and Co(OH)F precursors were coated on the CC. Then CoP/CC was prepared by phosphiding under low-temperature resulting in CC in the form of nanorods, where CoP is in the form of a dense load of nanowires with lengths of about a few micrometers and diameters of about 100–200 nm. Orientation of the crystal plane is (011), and the crystal plane spacing is 2.83 nm, as shown in Fig. 3.

In addition to uniform morphology of cobalt phosphides, surface modification by etching cobalt phosphide has also been reported. Self-supported CoP mesoporous NRs arrays54 were prepared by Zhu et al. First, a three-electrode system was prepared, and a foam nickel template was used as a working electrode. The electrolyte contained Co2+, and H2PO2−, which generated CoP NRs during the electrolysis process. Second, CoP NRs were electrodeposited on the foam nickel template. Finally, the Ni template was etched to obtain mesoporous CoP NRs. Diameters of the mesoporous were about 100–200 μm, and the diameters of NRs were 50–120 nm. NRs grew along (211) planes, and the spacing of the planes was 0.189 nm.
2.2 Nickel phosphide nanomaterials
Phosphides of nickel were also studied like those of cobalt. Lu et al. reported a monophase nickel phosphide/carbon (Ni5P4/C).44 Ni(acac)2 was mixed with trioctylphosphine (TOP) and oleic acid (OA), then tri-n-octylamine (TOA) was added during stirring to obtain a Ni(acac)2–TOA complex. This was subsequently heated 2 h at 450 °C under Ar2 to obtain Ni5P4–Ni2P/C. Finally, annealing 2 h at 500 °C under air obtained Ni5P4/C. The shell showed a thickness of about 10 nm, and the whole microsphere was about 100 nm. In different work, Chen et al. prepared Ni/NixMy (M = P, S).55 In that paper, Ni foam was added to HCl solution, then oxidized to Ni/NiO. Secondly, it was phosphided under low-temperature to obtain Ni/Ni8P3 (denoted as Ni/NiP), and then sulfured to obtain Ni/Ni9S8 (denoted as Ni/NiS). HRTEM showed spacing of the (211) plane was 0.21 nm, and the spacing of (300) was 0.19 nm in Ni8P3. Spacing of the (311) plane was 0.28 nm, and the spacing of (133) was 0.23 nm in Ni9S8, as shown in Fig. 4.

As usual, the MOF method often obtained 3D-porous cubes or network structures. Lately, 2D-carbon coated porous nickel phosphides nanoplates were prepared through a Ni-based MOF [Ni(H2O)2][Ni(CN)4] Prussian blue analogue (PBA) nanoplates as the precursor,18 shown in Scheme 1. Moreover, porous nickel phosphides nanoplates (Ni–P) were formed with Ni5P4 and Ni2P phases. The surfaces of the Ni–Ps became rough compared with Ni–PBA, and FESEM and TEM images showed a highly porous nature (Fig. 5).

While hollow Ni2P, CoP, and FeP NPs have been prepared, and porous metal phosphides also have been synthesized, porous hollow metal phosphides have not been reported so far. Jin et al. reported Ni3P porous hollow nanospheres (PHNs) by a solvothermal reaction in alkaline conditions.56 NaH2PO2 was dissolved in deionized water, annealed, and etched in HCl solution to obtain Ni3P PHNs. The PHNs showed thicknesses of their shells varying from 10 to 20 nm, their diameters from 79 to 99 nm, and the atomic ratio of Ni:P as 3.2:1, as shown in Fig. 6.

2.3 Iron phosphide nanomaterials
Iron is an active transition metal and its phosphides have also been reported. Tian et al. manufactured the iron phosphide (FeP) NPs;37 α-Fe2O3 was synthesized by a hydrothermal method, and FeP NPs obtained at 400 °C with a Fe/P ratio of 1:1–1:4. FeP NPs had an average size of 50 nm and grew along the (002) plane, of which the spacing was 0.290 nm. XPS showed the Fe3+ ions and P3− ions in FeP. Moreover, Liang et al. created self-supported FeP NRs arrays (FeP NAs).39 CC was used as a substrate, then Fe2O3 NRs were deposited on CC to obtain Fe2O3/CC; finally, this hybrid was phosphided to obtain FeP/CC. HRTEM showed the lattice fringes with a distance of 0.27 nm corresponding to the (011) plane of FeP, as shown in Fig. 7.

Iron phosphides composited with porous materials also have been reported; Zhang et al. engineered FeP embedded in N, P, dual-doped porous carbon NSs.57 In their work, phytic acid (PA) was complexed with FeCl3 to form iron phytate (FePA), and then adsorbed folic acid (FA) to obtain FePA–FA. Afterwards, FePA–FA was pyrolyzed 2 h at 900 °C to obtain FeP–Fe2P. Finally, the precursor was etched with acid to remove Fe2P and obtain FeP. FeP NPs had a size of 18–40 nm embedded in the carbon NSs. Several nanopores were observed with a size 21–60 nm, which might be obtained by washing with sulfuric acid. Additionally, FeP NPs grew along (011) planes with a spacing of 0.27 nm, as shown in Fig. 8.

Phosphides loaded on a supporter to form complex substances have been also reported. These compounds always used a 3D supporter as a skeleton, while Yan et al.58 used a 2D supporter of carbon nanotubes (CNT) to grow pore-rich FeP NRs on it. The NRs were obtained via a bottom-up assembly of FeO(OH) nanospindles on CNT (FeO(OH)@CNT), as shown in Fig. 9 and a BET test showed 55 m2 g−1 for FeO(OH)@CNT up to 98 m2 g−1 after phosphorization.

2.4 Ternary phosphide nanomaterials
Research on multiple phosphides has also been reported. Liu et al. obtained Mn–Co–P NSs.38 Inductively coupled plasma atom emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) suggested that the atomic ratio of Mn:Co:P was 0.08:0.92:1. In another work, Tang et al. prepared Fe-doped CoP NWs43 with diameters of about 100 nm. The Fe, Co, P ratio was close to 0.1:0.9:1.0. FexCo1−xP NWs46 were synthesized with diameters in the range of 100–200 nm. Atomic ratio for Fe:Co:P was about 1:1:2. The replacement of Co by Fe slightly increased the distance of 2.83 Å to 2.85 Å for CoP (011) planes, as shown in Fig. 10.

In addition to doping, other compounds have been researched that Wang et al. invented, namely Ni2P–CoP hybrid nanoarrays (NAs)47 as shown in Scheme 2. Nanosheet (NS) thicknesses of Ni2P–CoP hybrid nanosheet arrays (HNSAs) were about 10 nm, and the molar ratio of Ni2P:CoP was 1:2. The (011), (111), and (112) planes have spacings of 0.283 nm, 0.249 nm, and 0.198 nm with CoP, and the (111) and (201) planes have spacings of 0.228 nm and 0.202 nm with Ni2P, respectively, as shown in Fig. 11.

Ternary NiCoP nanostructures59 have been reported by Liang et al. The ratio of Ni/Co/P was 1.106:1:1.138, close to that of NiCoP. The NiCoP NPs were surrounded by amorphous shells. This might be explained by air oxidized NiCoP, as shown in Fig. 12. Moreover, Zhang et al. developed ternary NiCo2Px NWs.48 Li et al. obtained ternary Ni2−xCoxP (ref. 60) with a diameter of around 90 nm, and the atomic ratio of Ni:Co:P was about 1:2:2, suggesting a ratio of 1:1 for CoP:NiCoP.

In addition to ternary NiCoP nanostructures, ternary Ni–Fe–P porous NRs have been reported by Ahn et al.61 These NRs also grew without the addition of a polymeric binder. In their work, NiFe oxyhydroxide nanoflakes (NFs) grew on Ni foams, then turned to MOF-modified Ni–Fe NRs through a hydrothermal reaction, and finally transformed to carbon-incorporated porous Ni–Fe–P NRs after phosphorization by NaH2PO2.
Recently, synthesis of multi-shell mixed-metal oxyphosphide particles was reported by Guan et al.62 The mixed-metal coordination polymer was calcinated for a long time to obtain a multi-shell mixed-metal oxide, then the oxidized precursor was subjected to phosphidation by Na2H2PO2 to form a multi-shell mixed-metal oxyphosphide. Different mixed-metal multi-shell (Ni–Co, Ni–Mn, and Mn–Co–Ni) oxyphosphide particles are shown in Fig. 13 with approximate appearances. These multi-shell particles possess unique seven-layer structures with crumpled shells and each layer is composed of very little NCs.

Compared with solid and network nanostructures, hollow nanostructures might provide many more active sites for electrochemical reactions. Recently, carbon-incorporated nickel–cobalt mixed metal phosphide nanoboxes (Nbs) were found through a metal–organic framework (MOF)-based strategy.63 Co-Based zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF-67) nanocubes (NCbs) reacted with Ni(NO3)2 to form Ni–Co layered double hydroxide (LDH) on the NCbs' surface. In the meantime, the inside part of ZIF-67 spread out of the NCbs to obtain ZIF-67@LDH Nbs. After phosphidation by NaH2PO2, Ni–Co mixed metal phosphide was achieved, while the organic part of ZIF-67 was changed to non-crystalline carbon. Finally, NiCoP/C Nbs nanocomposites were obtained. There were a lot of NPs on the surface of the NiCoP/C Nbs, and inside of the Nbs the porous structure was formed as shown in Fig. 14.

3. INM phosphides for HER, ORR and OER
3.1 INM phosphides as catalysts for HER
Cobalt phosphides have been applied in many aspects, especially because of their advantages in HER, which are widely reported. Tian et al. synthesized 3D-CoP NWs for HER.53 The CoP/CC catalyst showed an onset overpotential of 38 mV, and achieved current densities of 10, 20, and 100 mA cm−2 only by overpotentials of 67, 100, and 204 mV, respectively. These proven CoP/CC had better HER catalytic activity than most of the reported non-Pt HER catalysts. The Tafel slope for CoP/CC was 51 mV dec−1, which is a little higher than 30 mV dec−1 of Pt/C. After 5000 cycles, the current density showed negligible difference compared with the initial one. These demonstrated CoP/CC was good with the HER process. CoP mesoporous NRs (CoP MNA) were reported as a HER catalyst54 with a nearly zero onset overpotential, which largely exceeded that of noble Pt in both onset potential and current behavior. The Tafel slope of CoP-MNA was 51 mV dec−1, which was lower than 63 mV dec−1 of Pt. After 5000 cycles, CoP-MNA only lost 6.8% current, while the CoP on Ni lost 33.7%; so this catalyst exhibited much better properties than several recently reported INM catalysts. These demonstrated CoP-MNA had better HER catalytic activity than Pt. In another work, Yuan et al. reported CoP NPs with 3D-BMHNC as a catalyst for HER.36 Although Pt/C showed an overpotential close to 0, CoP/BMHNC also showed a very close catalytic activity to Pt/C. The overpotential of CoP/BMHNC was only 7 mV, and required only 95.8 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm−2, which was the lowest reported for INM HER catalysts. CoP/BMHNC-D, CoP/MWNT, and CoP/GO have onset overpotentials of 70, 79, and 127 mV, respectively, and with 163, 165, and 299 mV to achieve 10 mA cm−2, respectively. The Tafel slope of Pt/C was 28.1 mV dec−1, and the CoP/BMHNC had a little higher slope of 33 mV dec−1. Therefore, CoP NPs in BMHNC had a high catalytic activity for HER. The linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) showed the loss of the cyclic voltammetry (CV) current density was negligible after 2000 cycles compared with the original one, demonstrating great stability of CoP/BMHNC catalysts, as shown in Fig. 15.

Co2P NPs were fabricated to be encapsulated in N and P-dual doped graphene (Co2P@NPG) for HER.64 To obtain 1, 10, 20, and 100 mA cm−2, the Co2P@NPG required 45, 103, 128, and 220 mV overpotentials, respectively. The Tafel slope of Co2P@NPG was 58 mV dec−1, which was a slightly higher than the 31 mV dec−1 of Pt/C. After 2000 cycles, the current showed a negligible difference compared to the initial one. And in PBS and KOH solution, Co2P@NPG also had good catalytic activity, as shown in Fig. 16.

Another Co2P nanostructure catalyst was made for HER by Juan et al.49 In this work, Pt required overpotentials of −19 mV and −25 mV to achieve current densities of −10 mA cm−2 and −20 mA cm−2, and CoP/Ti and Co2P/Ti needed −75 mV, −95 mV, and −90 mV, −109 mV to achieve −10 mA cm−2 and −20 mA cm−2, respectively. This indicated that both CoP and Co2P had high HER catalytic activity. The Tafel slope of Pt was 30 mV dec−1, while for CoP/Ti and Co2P/Ti, they were 50 mV dec−1 and 45 mV dec−1, respectively. These demonstrated Co2P/Ti had nearly HER catalytic activity of Pt. After 500 cycles, the overpotentials to achieve the above current densities for CoP/Ti and Co2P/Ti increased only 2 mV and 10 mV. So, these catalysts were stable for HER.
Compounds containing nickel and cobalt have similar properties in many aspects. For example, Chen et al. used Ni/NixMy (M = P, S) as a HER catalyst.55 Ni-Foam had weak HER electroactivity, and the Ni/NiS and the Ni/NiP had low overpotentials of 0.13 V and 0.23 V to achieve a 10 mA cm−2 current density. Therefore, it is not as good as Ni/Pt–C, but better than a lot of reported HER catalysts. The Tafel slope of Ni/NiP was 58.5 mV dec−1, which was slightly higher than 37.8 mV dec−1 of Ni/Pt–C. After 24 h, the current density of Ni/NiP and Ni/NiS showed no change. This demonstrated that Ni/NiP had good catalytic activity for HER. Except for porous catalysts, the porous hollow Ni3P PHNs were prepared to efficiently catalyze HER.56 In their work, the Tafel slope of Ni3P PHNs was 50 mV dec−1, which was a little higher than 30 mV dec−1 of Pt/C. And after 40000 s, the current density had changed very little, which meant the Ni3P PHNs could be used as a HER catalyst. In another work, ternary NiCo2Px NWs were reported as HER catalysts.48 In KOH solution, PBS solution, and H2SO4 solution, the onset overpotentials of Pt were 23 mV, 99 mV, and 50 mV, respectively, while the onset overpotentials of NiCo2Px were 11 mV, 63 mV, and 104 mV, respectively. The Tafel slopes of NiCo2Px were 34.3 mV dec−1, 63.3 mV dec−1, and 59.6 mV dec−1 in KOH, PBS, and H2SO4 solution, respectively. These were compared with 62.6 mV dec−1, 64.9 mV dec−1, and 32.5 mV dec−1 of Pt/C, respectively, indicating that NiCo2Px had better HER electroactivity than Pt/C in KOH and PBS solution, and had good HER electroactivity in H2SO4 solution, as shown in Fig. 17. These reported NiCo2Px performed with a considerable overpotential (104 mV) at 10 mA cm−2 that was better than most of the recently reported HER catalysts, such as CoS2-NW array (145 mV), Ni5P–Ni2P-NS array (120 mV), CoPS film (128 mV), Ni5P (140 mV), CoSe2 (137 mV), and Mn0.05Co0.95Se2 (195 mV).48

Similarly, iron phosphide had the same properties as cobalt phosphide; Juan et al. reported FeP NPs as HER catalysts.66 The FeP/Ti had current densities of −10 and −20 mA cm−2 at overpotentials of −50 mV, −102 mV, and −61 mV, −136 mV, which were closer to −18 mV, −45 mV, and −26 mV, −65 mV of Pt, respectively, lower than some other reported catalysts in acid solution and in neutral pH solution. The Tafel slope of FeP/Ti was 37 mV dec−1, which was slightly larger than 30 mV dec−1 of Pt in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution. After 16 h, the overpotentials increased to 35 mV and 52 mV in neutral pH and acidic solutions. After 500 and 1000 cycles, the overpotentials increased 19 mV and 25 mV in acidic solution and had no measurable increase in neutral solution. These demonstrated that FeP/Ti was good at a HER process with great stability after several hours in both acidic and neutral solutions.
It is well known that doping or compounding sometimes might improve the properties of materials. Liu et al. reported Mn–Co–P NSs used for the HER process.38 The Mn–Co–P/Ti needed only 49 mV to attain 10 mA cm−2. The Tafel slope of Mn–Co–P/Ti was 55 mV dec−1, lower than 60 mV dec−1 of CoP/Ti and a little higher than Pt/C of 30 mV dec−1. After 1000 cycles, the current density remained unchanged. These results demonstrated Mn–Co–P/Ti had great stability and good HER catalytic activity. In another work, Tang et al. found that Fe-doped CoP NAs were great with the HER process.43 The onset potential of Fe–CoP/Ti was −0.078 V, which was very close to −0.03 V of Pt/C. The Tafel slope of Fe–CoP/Ti was 75 mV dec−1, which was slightly higher than 60 mV dec−1 of Pt/C and a little lower than 78 mV dec−1 of CoP/Ti. And after 1000 cycles, the current density had not changed. These demonstrated that Fe–CoP was very stable and efficient for the HER process. Moreover, Tang et al. synthesized ternary FexCo1−xP NAs as a HER catalyst.46 The Fe0.5Co0.5P/CC had the lowest onset overpotential close to that of Pt/C and only needed 37 mV to drive 10 mA cm−2, which was only 7 mV more than that of Pt/C. The Tafel slope of Fe0.5Co0.5P/CC was 30 mV dec−1, which was only 2 mV more than that of Pt/C and lower than other FexCo1−xP/CC. These demonstrated Fe0.5Co0.5P/CC had nice HER catalytic activity, as shown in Fig. 18.

Li et al. obtained ternary Ni2−xCoxP for HER.60 The NiCoP catalyst had an overpotential as low as 59 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm−2, which was much smaller than others. And the Tafel slope of NiCoP was around 50 mV dec−1, which was close to 30.4 mV dec−1 of Pt/C. After 18 h, the current density was almost unchanged. These demonstrated that NiCoP had the most catalytic activity for HER in this report. Moreover, Wang et al. prepared Ni2P–CoP NAs/C for HER.47 The Ni2P–CoP HNSAs/CC had much lower onset overpotential, which was only around 40 mV, and the molar ratio of Ni2P/CoP had the best HER catalytic activity among Ni2P–CoP HNSAs/CC catalysts. The Tafel slope of Ni2P–CoP HNSAs/CC was ∼40 mV dec−1, which was close to 30 mV dec−1 of Pt/C and much lower than other catalysts in this report. After 1000, 2000, and 3000 cycles, the current densities had not changed. These demonstrated that Ni2P–CoP HNSAs/CC had great HER catalytic activity and good stability, as shown in Fig. 19.

According to the above reports, CoP had a wider range of applications in HER than NiP and FeP. However, for any single phosphide, its catalytic performance was not so ideal. We found that phosphide compounds and multiple phosphides had more significant activities in HER. These enhancements were due to synergistic effects between different metal ions, or the coupling effect between metal phosphides and the supporters. The effects increased the reactive centers of the HER, and provided more active sites. Therefore, ternary INM phosphides and composite catalysts performed much better in HER. The reported catalysts are shown in Tables 1 and 2.

Of course, different structures and morphologies of INM phosphide always exhibited different performances. It can be seen that the supporters with large specific surface areas could attach more INM phosphide in their mesh structures with more active sites. That reduced the agglomeration of the INM phosphides, and further enhanced the catalytic activity.
3.2 INM phosphides as catalysts for ORR
Cobalt phosphides were usually used as HER catalysts, but in another work, Vicky et al. prefabricated Co2P NRs for ORR.50 The electron transfer number was calculated to be 3.98–4.18 for Co2P NRs, indicating a complete four-electron ORR process in this reaction. The Co2P NRs/C catalyst had a half-potential of −0.196 V, which was only 49 mV lower than that of Pt. After 25000 s, the Co2P NRs/C retained 75% current density, but the Pt/C only retained 48%. These demonstrated that Co2P NRs/C had comparable ORR catalytic activity to Pt/C, and better stability than Pt/C. Some of the unique structures of polymers could enhance the catalytic performance of phosphides on a regular basis. In the following work, Wu et al. reported a cobalt porphyrin-based conjugated mesoporous polymer (CoP-CMP) as an ORR catalyst.27 The CoP-CMP800 had a more positive onset potential of −0.12 V, and a more positive half-wave potential of −0.18 V, which are closer to Pt/C. And the electron transfer number was calculated to be 3.83–3.86, which indicated a 4-electron ORR process dominated position. These demonstrated that CoP-CMP800 had the greatest ORR catalytic activity reported and it was better than many reported ORR catalysts, as shown in Fig. 20.

Few studies have been reported for INM phosphides as ORR catalysts. From the reported results, it can be found that cobalt phosphides and their composite materials had better effects on ORR, and their electron transfer number was close to 4. However, for the application of INM phosphides in terms of the ORR, there were still many challenges and opportunities for us.
3.3 INM phosphides as catalysts for OER
In addition to HER and ORR, cobalt phosphide as catalysts of OER have also been reported. Chang et al. synthesized surface oxidized CoP NRs as catalysts for OER.40 The CoP/NPs and CoP/NRs had very similar overpotentials, achieving a current density of 10 mA cm−2. The overpotentials of 340 mV and 320 mV were comparable to IrO2. At 1.65 V the OER activity for CoP NR/C was the highest. The Tafel slope of CoP NR/C was only 71 mV dec−1, lower than 76 mV dec−1 for IrO2. After 3000 CV cycles, the polarization curves of CoP NR/C and CoP NP/C had a negligible difference. These demonstrated CoP NR/C had high catalytic activity and stability for OER, as shown in Fig. 21.

In addition to cobalt phosphides, multi-shell mixed-metal oxyphosphides have been reported to enhance electrocatalytic activity in OER.62 In this work, the activated Mn–Co oxyphosphides showed a nice performance in the OER phase, and Mn–Co oxide had the lowest Tafel slope of 60 mV dec−1, while the activated Mn–Co oxyphosphides had the lowest one of 52 mV dec−1. To reach a current density of 10 mA cm−2, the activated Mn–Co oxyphosphides, Mn–Co oxides, and the RuO2 particles needed overpotentials of 370 mV, 420 mV, and 366 mV, respectively. After 8 h, the current density of these multi-shell particles had no obvious change. These results meant the particles were good with OER, as shown in Fig. 22.

Some researchers found that two-phase metal phosphides improved electrocatalytic activity compared to single phase metal phosphides. Meanwhile, carbon-incorporated nickel–cobalt mixed metal phosphide Nbs63 performed greater electrocatalytic activity in OER. NiCoP/C Nbs exhibited the lowest onset potential and the highest current density for OER. They required an overpotential of 330 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm−2, which is lower than that of NiCoP Nbs (370 mV) and NiCo-LDH Nbs (420 mV). And the Tafel slope of 96 mV dec−1 for NiCoP/C Nbs was the lowest of these Nbs. After 10 h, the NiCoP/C Nbs retained 96.5% current, which was much higher than those of NiCoP Nbs (87%) and NiCo-LDH (60%). These demonstrated that NiCoP/C Nbs were good at OER.
Although 3D morphology nanostructures provided more specific surface areas, these 2D nanoplates (Ni–P) also had highly efficient catalytic activity for OER.18 The as-prepared Ni–P showed higher current density (1.48 V vs. RHE) than Ni(OH)2 NPls (1.49 V vs. RHE) and NiO NPls (1.58 V vs. RHE). The Tafel slope of Ni–P was 64 mV dec−1, which was much lower than that of Ni(OH)2 and NiO. These proved that Ni–P had highly electrocatalytic activity for OER.
In another work, FeP NRs loaded on 2D long chain supporters as a backbone performed great OER electrocatalytic activity.58 In their work, the FeP@CNT showed an onset of OER current at about 1.48 V vs. RHE similarly to IrO2, and the Tafel slope of FeP@CNT was 53.0 mV dec−1, which was just a little higher that of IrO2 (50.0 mV dec−1). After a stability test, FeP@CNT showed a merely 50 mV increase of overpotential during 14 h of continuous operation. These meant that FeP@CNT performed well in OER.
As compared with HER, OER also played an important role in both fuel cell and overall water splitting, and these activities determined catalytic efficiency as well. Through an analysis of these reports, it was found that ternary INM phosphides had higher activities than single INM phosphides in OER, and the newly reported multiple INM oxyphosphide exhibited excellent catalytic performance in OER. At the same time, the 2D-supporter such as CNT composite INM phosphide showed remarkable catalytic activity in OER, as shown in Table 3. These new designs provided more ideas for further research with OER catalysts.

3.4 INM phosphides as catalysts for both reactions
In different work, Zhang et al. delivered FeP embedded in N and P-dual doped porous carbon NSs as ORR and OER catalysts.57 The onset overpotential of FeP@NPCs for ORR was 0.65 V, and the electron transfer number was calculated to be around 4. The Tafel slope of FeP@NPCs was 78 mV dec−1, which was a little higher than 69 mV dec−1 of Pt/C. These indicated the FeP@NPCs had good ORR electroactivity, as shown in Fig. 23. FeP@NPCs,57 had an OER onset overpotential of 1.47 V, which was slightly higher than 1.44 V of RuO2 and lower than 1.68 V of Pt/C. The Tafel slope of FeP@NPCs was 118 mV dec−1, which was a little higher than 72 mV dec−1 of RuO2 and lower than 172 mV dec−1 of Pt/C. Moreover, after 5000 and 10000 cycles, the current densities had not obviously changed. These indicated that FeP@NPCs had great OER catalytic and excellent stability.

Moreover, Yang et al. synthesized urchin-like CoP NCs both for HER and ORR.51 CoP NCs had a very low overpotential of ∼180 mV at 100 mA cm−2, lower than those of many reported INM HER catalysts. The Tafel slope for CoP was 46 mV dec−1, little higher than 29 mV dec−1 of Pt/C. After 5000 and 10000 cycles, the current densities almost had not changed. These demonstrated that CoP NCs had great HER catalytic activity. The electron transfer number was calculated to be 3.5, which showed the CoP NCs were in the vast majority in agreement with a 4-electron ORR process. The Tafel slope for CoP was 51 mV dec−1, compared with 32 mV dec−1 of Pt/C. These results indicated CoP has nice ORR catalytic activity. After 30000 s, the CoP had negligible degradation. However, the Pt/C decreased 40%. Therefore, CoP is a catalyst with good activity and stability for both ORR and HER processes.
Cobalt multi-phosphides also had great catalytic activity in both OER and HER. Wu et al. manufactured 3D structure porous CoP3 nanoneedles (NN) as OER and HER catalysts.65 The CoP3 NPs showed 38 mV of onset overpotential, while CoP3 NAs/carbon fiber paper (CFP) showed 30 mV onset overpotential, which was closer to Pt/C onset overpotential. The Tafel slope of CoP3 NAs/CFP was 46 mV dec−1, slightly higher than 29 mV dec−1 of Pt/C. After 5000 cycles, there was no obvious change in the polarization curves, indicating CoP3 NAs/CFP had great HER catalytic activity. The CoP3 NAs/CFP required overpotentials of 334 mV and 407 mV to achieve 10 and 50 mA cm−2, while RuO2 required 380 mV. The Tafel slope of CoP3 NAs/CFP was 62 mV dec−1, which was only a little lower than 57 mV dec−1 of RuO2/CFP. After 5000 cycles, there was a small decrease in the current density. Therefore, CoP3 NAs/CFP was good for both OER and HER processes. Even now overall water splitting attracts many researchers to discover catalysts that are good for both OER and HER. Ahn et al. directly grew ternary Ni–Fe–P porous NRs on Ni foams as an active and robust bi-functional electrocatalyst.61 In this work, the OER activity of Ni–Fe–P@C NRs was better than those of NiFe NFs and Ni–Fe–P. It needed an overpotential of 217 mV to reach 10 mA cm−2, which is lower than other catalysts. Furthermore, the Ni–Fe–P@C NRs showed a Tafel slope of 40 mV dec−1, which is lower than that of others (72.6 mV dec−1, 62.6 mV dec−1). Moreover, after OER 22 h, its overpotential had no change. The HER activity of Ni–Fe–P@C NRs was the best too. In other words, Ni–Fe–P@C NRs exhibited a Tafel slope of 92.6 mV dec−1, which is lower than that of Ni–Fe NFs (116 mV dec−1) and Ni–Fe–P (101.2 mV dec−1). After a 24 h HER, the overpotential had no change, as shown in Fig. 24. These results demonstrated that the porous Ni–Fe–P@C are active for both HER and OER.

Through the above reports, it is found that cobalt multiple-phosphide NAs exhibited the lowest onset potential in HER and great catalytic performance in OER. Increases in phosphorus might improve interactions between Co ion and P ion, and these might form more active sites. Therefore, the NAs performed very nicely in both HER and OER. The newly reported porous Ni–Fe–P@C showed the lowest overpotential (217 mV) to achieve 10 mA cm−2 and the lowest Tafel slope (40 mV dec−1) in OER. This remarkable enhancement is due to synergistic effects between different metal ions and a porous carrier exposed to more active sites that are often obscured by reunions.
In general, no matter what kind of reactions, the catalytic performances of multiple phosphides were much better than those of single phosphides, and the interactions among different metal ions synergistically promoted electrocatalytic activities. Moreover, since physical adsorption and chemical cross linking between the carriers and the catalysts could further increase the active sites, phosphide compounds had superior catalytic properties. Of course, catalysts with different morphologies also had different catalytic activities. Generally, the larger the specific surface area is, the rougher the surfaces of catalysts and supporters are, and the better the catalytic performances of them are.
4. Concluding remarks
In summary, inexpensive nonprecious metal phosphides began to be widely researched in recent years, and phosphides are potential alternative catalysts to replace expensive commercial catalysts. Traditional carbon-based materials (Pt/C, etc.) have been used as catalysts for a long time, but many problems persist in the field of fuel cells, such as high cost, poor stability, and CO poisoning. Therefore, it is expected of researchers to open new directions and find more and better catalysts. This paper reviews recent research progress with phosphides including ORR, OER, and HER catalysts, and provides new ideas for developing efficient, cheap, stable catalysts for fuel cells, while being comparable to commercial catalysts.
