    , Accepted 5th December 2016First published on 5th December 2016AbstractThe present study focuses on the synthesis of MoS2–MoO3 nanostructures via a hydrothermal method and their application in the modification of CdS photoanodes. Structural characterization reveals that with an increase in the hydrothermal reaction time the fraction of the MoS2 phase increases in the MoS2–MoO3 nanostructures, with MoS2 being dominant in the sample obtained at the maximum reaction time. TEM characterization reveals the formation of ultra thin nanosheets in the MoS2–MoO3 system. Correspondingly, the bandgaps estimated from the Tauc plot analysis indicate a bandgap tuning from 2.40 eV to 1.73 eV for these Mo-nanostructures. The surfaces of spray deposited nanostructured CdS thin films were further modified with these Mo-nanostructures via a very simple and economic chemical impregnation method. The CdS photoanodes modified with the MoS2–MoO3 nanosheets exhibit the highest PEC performance which is 4 times the photocurrent of bare CdS photoanodes. In addition, the stability of the modified photoanodes is enhanced to more than 8 hours compared to a few minutes for bare and photocorrosive CdS. The improved PEC performance is attributed to the formation of the n-CdS/p-MoS2 junction that suppresses the undesirable electron–hole recombination process and thus improves the charge transfer process. A solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency of 1.9% is reported for the MoS2–MoO3 nanosheets modified CdS photoanode.
1. Introduction
The photoelectrochemical cell (PEC) is a reliable renewable technology to utilize solar energy to obtain hydrogen gas from the abundant source of water.1–3 There has been remarkable progress in this field in the past decade; however, the identification of a suitable photoanode material is still lacking. CdS is one of the widely studied semiconductors for this application due to its low bandgap (2.4 eV) that matches well with the energy of the visible spectrum of sunlight. In addition, its conduction band edge is very suitable for H2 generation4 using water splitting. However, it is important to note that CdS shows a low charge separation efficiency of charge carriers and is thus prone to photocorrosion.5–7 Therefore, CdS is being studied in combination with other materials with the focus on achieving heterojunctions, co-catalysts and/or supporters. The architecture of hybrid materials consisting of at least two different types of semiconductors is regarded as a reliable strategy to promote the separation of photo-generated charge carriers.8,9 Interestingly, the formation of a p–n junction comprising of alternate layers of p-type and n-type semiconductors has proven to be a remarkable strategy for opto-electronic and photocatalytic applications. The existence of a p–n junction at an interface reduces charge recombination by the accumulation of electrons in the n-type region and holes in the p-type region. Consequently, this mechanism suppresses the charge recombination process and thus enhances the photo-electronic device performance.10
MoS2 is a promising semiconducting material that displays tremendous applications in the field of electronics, photovoltaics and electro-catalysis. Its lattice is composed of Mo-atoms coupled between two layers of hexagonal close packed sulphur atoms via van der Waals forces in a structure similar to the lubricating graphene lattice.11 Particularly, p-type MoS2 nanosheets are a promising candidate for the formation of the p–n junction by integrating p-type MoS2 nanosheets with n-type CdS.12 This 2D MoS2/CdS structure improves the separation of photo-excited charge carriers and hence reduces the recombination process. There are numerous reports highlighting the superior performance of this heterostructure.
The potential of the CdS/MoS2 heterostructure was realized by Li et al. who demonstrated the loading of MoS2 particles on the commercial CdS.13 The junction formed between MoS2 and CdS is responsible for the enhanced photocatalytic activity of the composite. The authors proved the promising candidature of MoS2 catalysts in order to substitute costly inert metals such as Pt. Subsequently, numerous reports were published on CdS/MoS2. Min et al. reported dual function MoS2 sheets that modify CdS branches to yield heterostructures, which impart stability as well as enhanced photocatalytic activity to CdS.14 Zhang et al. reported a photocurrent density of 0.25 mA cm−2 for MoS2/CdS nano-hybrids.15 Liu et al. studied the MoS2/CdS heterojunction and reported a photocurrent density of 26 mA cm−2 for photons of the wavelength λ ≥ 420 nm.16 They reported an efficient performance of the CdS/MoS2 heterojunction; the efficient performance could be attributed to the formation of a p–n junction at the interface. These reports clearly demonstrate the importance of the CdS/MoS2 heterojunction that yields improved performances due to the formation of a junction. The CdS and MoS2 systems are an ideal match to yield a perfect junction in view of their compatible hexagonal crystal structure. Nonetheless, MoS2 has gained wide attention due to its high catalytic properties and high stability in aqueous media. The literature on hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) shows MoS2 as an important catalyst since it displays a very low over-potential of 692 mV.17 However, its large internal resistance in bulk crystal structures leads to inefficient catalysts. This limitation necessitates the study of MoS2–MoO3 hybrid structures.18 It is important to mention that nanostructuring affects charge transport properties. We used this fact to attain a p–n junction device with an improved PEC performance.
In this study, we synthesize ultrathin MoS2–MoO3 nanosheets via a simple hydrothermal methodology. The reaction time of the hydrothermal method is optimized to study its effect on the structural and optical properties of the MoS2–MoO3 nanostructure. Structural studies reveal the formation of a prominent MoO3 phase during the initial phase of the hydrothermal reaction, which gradually transforms MoO3 into MoS2 nanosheets. Optical investigations support the observation made in the structural studies. The as synthesized MoS2–MoO3 nanostructures are used for the modification of CdS photoanodes via a very simple and economic chemical impregnation method.19 In addition, photoelectrochemical characterization is carried out for the modified and bare CdS photoanodes. The improved performance of the 2D MoS2/CdS heterostructures is attributed to the formation of a p–n junction that leads to an efficient charge separation at the substrate (CdS)/adsorbate (nanosheets) interface.
2. Experimental
2.1 Materials and reagents
CdCl2 (99.999%), (NH)2CS (99.9%), (NH4)2MoO4 (99.98%), and NH2OH·HCl (99%) were obtained from Sigma Aldrich.
2.2 Deposition of CdS thin film
An automated spray pyrolysis technique was used for the deposition of the nanostructure CdS film in the present study. We performed several optimizations with respect to the film nucleation, growth, nanostructuring and thickness tuning to achieve the nanostructured films, as described in our earlier reports.20,21 Particularly, the film thickness was tuned by an automated computer interface system that can control the spraying gas-pressure, liquid precursor flow-rate and substrate temperature. Film deposition was carried out using an equimolar mixture of an aqueous CdCl2 (0.1 M) and (NH2)2CS (0.1 M) solution, which yielded a film precursor solution. Fluorine doped tin oxide, FTO (Pilkington TCO-15), with a resistivity of 12 Ω cm was used as the substrate to obtain an active PEC area of 1 cm2. The distance between the spray-nozzle and the FTO substrate was maintained constant (∼23 cm) throughout the experiments.
2.3 Synthesis of MoS2–MoO3 nanostructures
MoS2–MoO3 nanostructures were synthesized via a simple hydrothermal method.22 The precursor solution was prepared as follows by mixing two separately prepared solutions. For solution-1, 4 × 10−3 M of ammonium molybdate and 7 × 10−2 M of hydroxylamine hydrochloride were added to 50 mL of aqueous solution (deionized water). The mixture was thoroughly stirred to obtain solution-1. For the other solution, i.e. solution-2, 0.36 M of equivalent thiourea was dissolved in 50 mL of deionized water. Finally, solution-1 and solution-2 were homogeneously mixed to obtain final mixture. The pH of the final mixture solution was adjusted to pH ∼ 6 by the dropwise addition of 2 M HCl to the above mentioned mixture. Thus the obtained final mixture was the precursor solution used for further hydrothermal treatment. Accordingly, it was transferred to a Teflon container that was transferred later to a stainless steel-autoclave (reactor). The optimization of the desired volume of precursor and volume of reactor was an important step for this nanostructure fabrication. After transferring the Mo-precursor, the autoclave was heated to 180 °C for different time-intervals, specifically 10, 15, 24 and 36 h. The purpose of this optimization was dual in nature, one was to observe the phase evolution and other to control the morphology of the nanostructure. After performing the reaction for the desired time, the obtained precipitate was washed with deionized water and acetone. The chemically washed precipitate was further dried carefully to obtain the freestanding nanostructure powder. The MoS2–MoO3 nanostructure synthesized for different hydrothermal reaction times of 10, 15, 24 and 36 h were named T1, T2, T3 and T4, respectively, which are used throughout the manuscript for clarity.
2.4 Fabrication of nano MoS2 functionalized CdS PEC electrode
The MoS2 nanostructures were used for the modification of nanostructured CdS surfaces via a very simple chemical impregnation at room temperature. For this step, no linking agent was used to attain any bonding between the CdS substrate and MoS2 adsorbate. In a typical procedure,6,20 an aqueous solution of the MoS2 nanostructure was used. The homogeneous dispersion was used for chemical impregnation. The CdS electrode was impregnated for various times. An optimized reaction time of 7 minute was used for all experiments in this study. The other impregnation times did not yield homogeneous and uniform impregnation of the MoS2 nanostructures over the CdS surface. The CdS thin films impregnated for a longer impregnation time than 7 minute peeled off from the FTO making them unusable for sustainable PEC application (see ESI Fig. S1†). Herein, we used an analogous procedure to that reported in our past study.22 The morphology of the modified CdS films is correlated to the respective MoS2–MoO3 nanostructures (see ESI Fig. S2†). Accordingly, the functionalized CdS electrode was used for the fabrication of a PEC electrode. Briefly, a unit area modified CdS electrode was connected using an insulating copper lead over the film free conducting area of a TO substrate. Thus, the formed assembly was electrically insulated so that only the modified CdS is allowed to interact with the electrolyte of the PEC cell. The mechanism for the modification of the CdS photoanode with MoS2 nanosheets is shown in Scheme 1(a).

2.5 Characterization
The surface morphology of the bare and sulphide modified nanostructured films was observed using field emission scanning electron microscopy (Hitachi, S4300SE/N) operated at 20 kV. This allowed the confirmation of the nanoscopic nature of the PEC electrode surface. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopic (EDS) analysis was performed to ascertain the elemental characteristics of the films. X-ray diffraction patterns were obtained using a Bruker AX D8 XRD diffractometer equipped with a CuKα X-ray gun. Scanning was performed in the range of 2θ = 10–70° with an increment of 0.010 per second at the grazing angle of incidence. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (O-micron model) was used for the elemental and compositional analysis. Transmission spectra were recorded using a UV-Vis spectrometer (Perkin Elmer, Lambda 650). An FEI Tecnai G2 transmission electron microscope with an LaB6 filament was used to record the HRTEM images of the samples in the present study. An accelerating voltage of 200 kV was used to energize the electrons. Samples were prepared by dispersing the nanostructures in ethanol. The ethanol suspension was finally dropped onto a Cu grid for TEM analysis.
The surface modified CdS thin film electrodes with an area of 1 cm2 were used for PEC measurements and the results were converted to obtain the current density accordingly. The photoelectrochemical analysis was carried out using an electrochemical work station (PARSTAT 2273). A three-electrode configuration, with the modified photoanode as the working electrode, standard calomel electrode (SCE) as the reference electrode and graphite as the counter electrode, was used for measurement. Na2S (0.1 M) and Na2SO3 (0.01 M) were used as the electrolyte with the view to maintain the inherent stability of CdS. In order to carry out photoelectrochemical measurements, a solar simulator (Oriel Model 91160) equipped with AM 0, AM 1.0 and AM 1.5 Global (Newport) filters was utilized as the source. The irradiance of 80 mW cm−2 was used in the present case. All chronoamperometric measurements were carried out at an applied bias of 0.2 V/SCE. Scheme 1(b) shows the oxygen and hydrogen evolution reaction at the working electrode and counter electrode, respectively.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Structural, optical and morphological characterization of MoS2 nanostructures

Fig. 1(a) shows the XRD patterns of the MoS2–MoO3 nanostructures synthesized for different reaction times during the hydrothermal reaction. It is quite evident from the XRD patterns that sample T1, which was prepared by 10 h of reaction time, exhibits a dominant monoclinic MoO3 (JCPDS 00-37-1445) phase with preferential growth in the (101) direction. The other impurity peaks correspond to the unreacted precursor.

(d)–(g) FESEM images of the MoS2 nanostructures synthesized at different reaction times (T1 – 10 h, T2 – 15 h, T3 – 24 h and T4 – 36 h). (h) HRTEM image of the MoS2–MoO3 nanosheets prepared by 36 h of reaction time (inset shows low magnification TEM image). 
The XRD patterns clearly reveal that as the hydrothermal reaction time increases the percentage of hexagonal MoS2 (JCPDS 00-017-0744) phase increases and the MoO3 phase decreases proportionately. At 36 h of reaction time, the nanostructure exhibits the formation of a dominant MoS2 phase, although a minor impurity phase of MoO3 exists. Eventually, precursor impurity peaks are not observed in the XRD pattern of the nanostructures prepared at 24 and 36 h of reaction time. This is attributed to the complete conversion of the precursor into thermodynamically stable products (MoS2–MoO3).

Fig. 1(b) shows the Tauc plots of the MoS2–MoO3 nanostructures synthesized at different hydrothermal reaction times, which clearly show that there is a reduction in the bandgap as the reaction time increases from 10 to 36 h. This reduction in the bandgap is attributed to two factors. First, with an increase in the reaction time the size of the particles increases, which in turn minimizes the quantum confinement effect; this tends the bandgap to a bulk bandgap. Second, there is the effect of composition variation of MoS2 (Eg ∼ 1.29 eV) and MoO3 (Eg ∼ 3 eV). Structural characterization reveals that there is an increase in the MoS2 phase with an increase in reaction time, and thus a lower bandgap is exhibited for 36 h of reaction time.

Fig. 1(c) shows a photograph of the as synthesized MoS2 nanostructures obtained by varied reaction times. The tendency of a change in the dispersion colour to black can be directly correlated to the decrease in the bandgap due to the existence of disperse nanostructures. FESEM studies were carried out to understand the morphological evolution of the various nanostructures with an increase in reaction time. It can be clearly seen from Fig. 1(d)–(g) that the MoS2–MoO3 nanostructures synthesized at 10 h of reaction time gives a rod-bundle like morphology. With an increase in the reaction time to 15 h, flake-like structures are formed, and when the reaction time increased further to 24 h, flower-like nanostructures are formed. Fig. 1(h) shows the HRTEM image of the MoS2–MoO3 nanosheets prepared at the reaction time of 36 h (this reaction time shows highest fraction of MoS2 phase).
3.2 Structural, optical and elemental characterization of MoS2 nanostructures modified CdS photoanodes
To understand the effect of the functionalization of the MoS2 nanostructures over the CdS surface on the structural and optical properties of the CdS photoanode, XRD and UV-Vis spectrophotometry were carried out. The XRD patterns, as shown in Fig. 2(a), indicate that the existence of MoS2–MoO3 does not alter the XRD pattern of CdS. However, a decrease in the diffracted intensity of CdS is observed. Fig. 2(b) shows the transmission spectra of the CdS thin films modified with the MoS2 nanostructures. It is clear from the spectra that the absorption intensity of the CdS films increases in the visible light range due to the functionalization effect of the MoS2 nanostructures over CdS, although there is not much difference in the absorption edge of the bare and modified CdS thin films. Fig. 2(c) shows the survey spectrum of the nanosheets functionalized CdS films (with a reaction time of 10 h). It clearly shows the existence of relevant elements, namely Cd, S, Mo, and O, present on the surface of the modified CdS films.

3.3 Photoelectrochemical characterization of MoS2 nanostructures modified CdS photoanodes
PEC characterization was carried out to evaluate the effect of MoS2–MoO3 nanostructure functionalization over the CdS surface. Fig. 3(a) shows the chronoamperometric curves for bare and MoS2 functionalized CdS thin films. The bare CdS shows a photocurrent of 400 μA cm−2, whereas the CdS/T3 photoanode shows the highest photocurrent of 1.6 mA cm−2 at an applied bias of 0.2 V/SCE. This indicates that the modification leads to a 4-fold photocurrent enhancement compared to the bare CdS. Similar results are presented by the I–V characteristics of the unmodified and modified films, as shown in Fig. 3(b).

These results clearly reveal that the modified photoanodes show improved performances compared to the bare CdS photoanodes. This could be attributed to improved charge transfer processes due to the possible formation of a heterojunction,23,24 which facilitates electron and holes transfer at the interface and hence reduces the consequent charge recombination process. Furthermore, the better performance of CdS/T3 is assigned to the nanosheet morphology of MoS2. It is expected that in contrast to the planar surfaces, the nanosheets yield a larger surface area and thus more catalytically active sites, which are beneficial for the PEC reaction.
Accordingly, the above mentioned analysis indicates that the MoS2 modified CdS photoanodes act as a potential candidate for PEC hydrogen generation. It could be clearly seen from Fig. 3(c) that CdS/T3 shows the highest hydrogen evolution rate of 35 μmol h−1, which is much higher than that of CdS/T1, CdS/T2 and CdS/T4 (23, 16, 12 μmol h−1, respectively) and unmodified CdS film.

Fig. 3(d) shows the chronoamperometric curves of the MoS2 nanostructure modified CdS photoanodes acquired by long hours of measurements. It can be clearly observed from Fig. 3(d) that the photocurrent of CdS decreases with time, whereas CdS/T1 shows a stable photocurrent up to 8 h of PEC measurement. Stability measurements were carried out for all the modified photoanodes, however only CdS/T1 showed enhanced stability. The chronoamperometric curves of the other modified photoanodes for a prolonged period are shown in ESI Fig. S8.† To quantify the performance of the electrodes, various efficiencies, i.e. incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) and solar to hydrogen conversion efficiency (STH), were estimated (ESI Fig. S5 and S6†). The CdS/T3 photoanode shows the highest STH of 1.9% and IPCE of 11%, which are both appreciably higher than the unmodified CdS photoanode (STH 0.2% and IPCE 8%).
The results of the MoS2–MoO3 nanostructure modified films were compared with pure exfoliated MoS2 nanostructures. The exfoliation was carried out via ultrasonication of bulk MoS2 powder (ESI Section 1.1†). ESI Fig. S3† shows the FESEM images of the as-prepared exfoliated MoS2 and modified film for different ultrasonication times (30–90 min). After photoelectrochemical characterization (ESI Fig. S4†) it was revealed that CdS/T3 (1.6 mA cm−2) shows a much higher photocurrent density than the standard exfoliated sample (0.5 mA cm−2). These results clearly validate the superior performance of the MoS2–MoO3 nanostructure modified CdS films with respect to commercially available co-catalysts.
3.4 Mechanism of photocurrent enhancement in MoS2 nanostructures modified CdS photoanodes
It is clear from Fig. 4(a) that when CdS and MoS2 come in contact, formation of p–n junction at the interface occurs, which results in a useful synergetic effect. The photoelectrochemical performance of MoS2/CdS is much higher than the individual components, which suggests that the junction at MoS2/CdS favours electron transfer and charge separation at the interface. According to the Anderson model, band bending is inversely proportional to the carrier density and dielectric constant of a semiconductor.25 It is already known that the conductivity of bulk MoS2 is lower than that of CdS, which validates that band bending is mainly due to MoS2.16 With the formation of a p–n junction, the photoinduced electrons and holes remain separated due to their intrinsic electrostatic field. The photo-induced electrons in the conduction band of MoS2 are transferred to CdS and then to the counter electrode via an external circuit. Simultaneously, holes from the valence band of CdS are transferred to MoS2, where they produce oxygen gas. This phenomenon leads to an enhanced separation of the photoinduced electrons and holes, which suppresses the recombination process. To validate this fact we carried out Mott–Schottky measurements on the CdS/T1 films, as shown in Fig. 4(b). The co-existence of positive and negative slopes in the Mott–Schottky curve validates the presence of the p–n junction.26 The negative and positive slopes can be attributed to the p-type MoS2 and n-type CdS, respectively. In addition, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is the most recommended tool to validate the enhance charge transfer process at the interface. The arc radius of the EIS Nyquist plot shows the rate of reaction occurring at the surface of the electrode. A small arc radius depicts faster charge separation and charge transfer at the electrode–electrolyte interface. ESI Fig. S7† clearly indicates the improved performance of the CdS/T3 photoanode in contrast to the other modified electrodes. The comparison of the PEC performance of the present CdS/MoS2 photoanode with recently reported similar study27–33 is summarized in Table 1. The comparison is carried out only for CdS/MoS2-based materials (nanostructure and heterojunction categories) so that the complexity related to the intrinsic properties of different materials can be ruled out. We specifically noted that the top performing configuration in both categories, i.e. the nanostructure system and heterojunction system, differs, the former being 7 mA cm−2 and the latter being 26 mA cm−2. In the former category, our simple methodology yields an efficient performance. It is important to mention that the highest photocurrent density of 7 mA cm−2 is shown by the MoS2 modified CdS nanorods in the visible range; however, a complicated nanorod configuration is required. Since the performance of the photoanodes is not evaluated under ideal conditions, (using a solar simulator) an honest comparison could not be obtained between the different reports. In the present study, the photocurrent is found to be 1.6 mA cm−2 at a low applied bias of 0.2 V under a solar simulator, which is obtained by the simple modification of a CdS photoanode via the utilization of MoS2 nanosheets. This improvement in photocurrent with just a simple modification of the nanostructured CdS film surface thus has significant potential in economical and sustainable hydrogen production.

4. Conclusion
In this study, we describe the functionalization of the CdS surface by MoS2–MoO3 nanosheets using a simple chemical impregnation method. Prior to the modification, three different nanostructures, specifically bundled nanorods, nanoflakes and flower-like nanostructures, of MoS2–MoO3 were synthesized by varying the hydrothermal reaction time. TEM characterization confirms the formation of nanosheets. The MoS2 phase in the nanostructure increases with an increase in the hydrothermal reaction time, and accordingly the bandgap decreases in consonance with the MoS2 phase fraction. The modified CdS photoanode shows a four-fold increase in photocurrent and similar improvement in the hydrogen evolution rate. The CdS thin film modified with the MoS2–MoO3 nanosheets with 24 h of reaction time shows the highest photocurrent density of 1.6 mA cm−2. The best PEC performance of this modified photoanode is attributed to the composition and morphology of the films. The modified photoanode is found to be stable up to 8 h. The modified electrode shows an enhanced solar-to-hydrogen efficiency of 1.9%. This improved PEC performance is attributed to the formation of several n-CdS/p-MoS2 junctions that suppress the recombination of photo-induced charge carriers. The present study encourages the use of different Mo related compounds to improve the stability and efficiency of excellent photocatalytic and PEC materials such as CdS.
