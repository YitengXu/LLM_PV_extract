    , Accepted 8th September 2014First published on 8th September 2014AbstractThe pure and intense orange upconversion luminescence of Eu3+ was efficiently achieved in NaYF4 and NaLuF4 nanocrystals through the upconversion sensitization of doped Yb3+ and Mn2+ ions dimer for the first time. A shell-coating strategy was performed to further enhance the emission intensity. In this work, a novel upconversion mechanism for energy transfer from the Yb3+–Mn2+ dimer to the Eu3+ ion was proposed by analyzing the upconversion luminescence spectra, lifetimes and pumping photons measurements of the obtained nanocrystals in detail. The applications of the nanocrystals for CT imaging and ratiometric pH sensing in physiological pH range were performed. This study also provides a new upconversion spectral region at around 592 nm for applications in multicolor imaging, multiplexed encoding and detection.
Introduction
In recent years, lanthanide doped upconversion (UC) luminescent materials that can convert low-energy radiation to high-energy emission through multiphoton processes have attracted extensive interests due to their distinguished merits, including large anti-Stokes shifts, narrow band emissions, long excited-state lifetimes, superior photostability, low cytotoxicity, weak autofluorescence background and deep-tissue penetration.1–7 These advantages make them extremely suitable for various fields such as solid-state lasers, three-dimensional displays, white light emitting materials, solar cells, temperature sensing, photodynamic therapy, biological labeling and especially optical imaging.8–17 To date, Er3+, Tm3+ and Ho3+, which have ladder-like arranged energy levels, were considered as the most efficient activators among the lanthanide ions due to the facile energy transfer (ET) from the sensitizer Yb3+. However, to achieve efficient upconversion luminescence (UCL) for other lanthanide ions without long-lived intermediary energy states still remains challenging.18
Eu3+ is well-known for its intense red down-conversion (DC) emission in numerous materials such as coordination compounds, phosphors, nanocrystals (NCs) and lanthanide-containing organic–inorganic hybrid materials.19–24 Nevertheless, due to the absence of intermediary energy states and the large energy mismatch between Yb3+ and Eu3+, it is very difficult to achieve efficient UC emission of Eu3+ by simply co-doping Yb3+ and Eu3+ in NCs.25 To date, considerable efforts have been devoted to this field and pure UC emission of Eu3+ can mainly be obtained by simultaneously harvesting the energy of two photons from Yb3+ ions via cooperative UC processes,26–31 which is considered weaker and less effective than stepwise energy transfer upconversion (ETU) processes in Er3+, Tm3+, Ho3+ and Yb3+ co-doped systems. Moreover, a high-power pump laser is needed for the excitation of these materials. This problem greatly restricts the practical applications of Eu3+ UCL. To circumvent this issue, several researchers have put forward an energy migration-mediated upconversion (EMU) mechanism to tune UC processes in core–shell nanoparticles (NPs).18,32 Although relative strong Eu3+ UC emissions were attained in these materials, there are also some obvious drawbacks such as the insufficient color purity of Eu3+ due to the inevitable contamination of the blue light of Tm3+ in the core layer and the relatively tedious experimental procedures. Other researchers chose Er3+ and Ho3+ as sensitizers to excite Eu3+, but the spectral interference from Er3+ and Ho3+ cannot be eliminated.33,34
In order to overcome these disadvantages, it is necessary to explore a new path to achieve pure and high-efficiency Eu3+ UCL. Fortunately, we found that the 4T1 energy level of Mn2+ matches well with the 5D0 energy level of Eu3+, and the UCL of Mn2+ can be achieved through a Yb3+–Mn2+ dimer system in various host matrixes.35–40 In addition, Mn2+ is widely used as an energy bridge to obtain the single-band UCL of Er3+, Tm3+ and Ho3+ as discussed in a previous work.41–43 On account of these reasons, we speculate that the pure and intense UC emission of Eu3+ could be achieved in a Yb3+/Mn2+/Eu3+ co-doped system. To the best of our knowledge, there is no report focusing on the ET process between Mn2+ and Eu3+ in UCL materials. As a proof-of-concept experiment to verify the universality of our hypothesis, two frequently-used host lattices, i.e. NaYF4 and NaLuF4, were chosen as host materials due to their low phonon energy and feasibility for the co-doping of Yb3+, Mn2+ and Eu3+ simultaneously. When Yb3+, Mn2+ and Eu3+ ions were doped into the hosts, the Yb3+–Mn2+ dimers were easily formed, and the energy harvested by the Yb3+–Mn2+ dimers was efficiently transferred from the excited state |2F7/2,4T1> of Yb3+–Mn2+ dimers to the 5D0 energy level of Eu3+ ions to generate intense Eu3+ UC emission under a 980 nm continuous wave laser diode excitation. Moreover, the crystalline phase and the size of the NCs were greatly influenced by Mn2+ doping. To further increase the luminescent intensity, a core–shell structure was designed to minimize the surface defects that quench the emission intensity of Eu3+. The core–shell NCs that emit intense orange light at around 592 nm can greatly expand the available spectral range of existing UCL materials for applications in multicolor imaging, multiplexed encoding and detection.44–48 Furthermore, the NaLuF4-based NCs may be ideal multimodal imaging agents for both UC imaging and CT imaging due to the strong X-ray absorption of lutetium, which has the largest atomic number among the rare-earth elements.49–51
Results and discussion
Synthesis, morphology and phase transformation
The synthesis of NaYF4:Yb3+/Mn2+/Eu3+ and NaLuF4:Yb3+/Mn2+/Eu3+ NCs was performed by employing a modified liquid–solid solution (LSS) solvothermal strategy.42,52 The epitaxial growth of α-NaYF4 and α-NaLuF4 shell layer on core NCs was conducted according to a previously reported method.53 The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of the obtained NCs before and after the shell growth are shown in Fig. 1. The NaYF4:Yb3+/Mn2+/Eu3+ (5/30/15 mol%) NCs present are cubic in shape and have a uniform size of 15.4 nm (Fig. S1a†). The high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image exhibits well-resolved lattice fringes with a plane spacing of 0.276 nm and 0.197 nm, corresponding to the lattice planes of (200) and (220) of α-NaYF4, respectively. After the coating of the α-NaYF4 shell, the size of the NCs increased to 23.6 nm (Fig. S1b†), indicating the successful epitaxial growth of the α-NaYF4 shell layer on the core NCs. For the NaLuF4:Yb3+/Mn2+/Eu3+ (5/30/15 mol%) samples, a number of uniform round-corner cubic NCs with a size of around 18.9 nm (Fig. S1c†) are distinctly observed in the TEM image. In the HRTEM image, the interlayer spacing in a single NC can be precisely measured as 0.277 nm and 0.195 nm, which is in good agreement with the distance between the (200) and (220) planes of α-NaLuF4. After the α-NaLuF4 shell coating, the NCs grew up to 24.2 nm (Fig. S1d†), indicating that ca. 3 nm thickness shell was formed on the core. To confirm the chemical composition of the obtained samples, X-ray energy-dispersive (EDX) spectroscopy was used, and the results are presented in Fig. S2,† which exhibit the presence of pattern peaks of Y, Yb, Mn, Eu and Lu, Yb, Mn, Eu in NaYF4:Yb3+/Mn2+/Eu3+ (5/30/15 mol%) NCs and NaLuF4:Yb3+/Mn2+/Eu3+ (5/30/15 mol%) NCs, respectively, indicating that the exact ingredients were effectively built into the host lattices.

The scale bars are 100 nm in (a, c, e and g) and 5 nm in (b and f), respectively. 
The powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of NaYF4:Yb3+/Mn2+/Eu3+ (5/30/15 mol%) core and core–shell NCs in Fig. 1d match well with the standard cubic phase NaYF4 (JCPDS: 06-0342), which is consistent with the TEM analysis of the samples. The XRD patterns of NaLuF4:Yb3+/Mn2+/Eu3+ (5/30/15 mol%) core and core–shell NCs can be indexed in accordance with the standard pattern of cubic phase NaLuF4 (JCPDS: 27-0725) as well (Fig. 1h). To understand phase transformation at different Mn2+, Eu3+ and Yb3+ doping levels, XRD patterns of the obtained NCs samples with different Mn2+, Eu3+ and Yb3+ doping levels are given in Fig. S3–S5.† In the NaYF4:Yb3+/Mn2+/Eu3+ (5/y/15 mol%) (y = 0–40) series, the XRD pattern shows a mixed phase of α-NaYF4 (JCPDS: 06-0342) and β-NaYF4 (JCPDS: 16-0334) when no Mn2+ ions are added. While the doping concentration of Mn2+ ions was increased to 20%, the diffraction peaks of β-NaYF4 completely vanished. On further increasing the Mn2+ ions concentration to 40%, the impurity phase of β-NaYF4 reappeared. Moreover, the phase transformation is also evident with the doping concentration of Eu3+. For the NaYF4:Yb3+/Mn2+/Eu3+ (5/30/z mol%) (z = 0–30) systems, the β-NaYF4 phase appeared when the Eu3+ concentration was higher than 20%. However, the cubic phase of NaYF4 is relatively stable in the Yb3+ doping levels from 2% to 40%. These phenomena are mainly due to the variable ionic radii of the doping ions. The substitution of Y3+ (r = 0.89 Å) by the smaller Mn2+ (r = 0.81 Å) ions tend to produce the cubic phase, while the substitution of the larger Eu3+ (r = 0.95 Å) ions favors hexagonal structures. The Yb3+ (r = 0.87 Å) ions with an ionic radii similar to the Y3+ ions maintain the original phase of NaYF4.6,42,54,55
Upconversion luminescent property and energy transfer mechanism
To demonstrate the success of our strategy, UCL spectra of the obtained samples under a 980 nm continuous wave laser diode excitation were recorded, and the results are shown in Fig. 2 together with their optical images. The UCL spectra of both NaYF4:Yb3+/Mn2+/Eu3+ (5/30/15 mol%) and NaLuF4:Yb3+/Mn2+/Eu3+ (5/30/15 mol%) exhibit characteristic sharp emission peaks of Eu3+, which can be ascribed to the transitions of 5D0 → 7F1 (592 nm), 5D0 → 7F2 (609 nm), 5D0 → 7F3 (650 nm) and 5D0 → 7F4 (700 nm) of Eu3+. It is interesting to observe that the transition of 5D0 → 7F1 dominates the emission spectra compared with other peaks. This phenomenon was rarely achieved in Eu3+ UC processes, which may be due to the high-symmetry environments around the Eu3+ ions in α-NaYF4 and α-NaLuF4. It is well established that the magnetic-dipole transition of 5D0 → 7F1 is relatively insensitive to the local symmetry, but the electric-dipole transition of 5D0 → 7F2 is significantly affected by the symmetry in the local environments around the Eu3+ ions. The transition probability decreases with an increase in symmetry environments around the Eu3+ ions.56,57 After the inert shell coating, the integrated UCL intensity of these NCs remarkably increased by about 9.1 times and 8.4 times for NaYF4:Yb3+/Mn2+/Eu3+ (5/30/15 mol%) and NaLuF4:Yb3+/Mn2+/Eu3+ (5/30/15 mol%), respectively. Moreover, the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the 5D0 → 7F1 (592 nm) transition was measured to be 9 nm, which is less narrow than the emission peaks in Yb/Er, Yb/Ho and Yb/Tm systems.41 As shown in Fig. 2, the intense orange luminescence of Eu3+ is clearly visible to the naked eyes. To optimize the doping concentration of Mn2+, Eu3+ and Yb3+, NaYF4 NCs with different doping levels were prepared (Fig. S6–S8†). We found that the emission intensity of Eu3+ dramatically increased with the Mn2+ concentration, indicating that Mn2+ is a critical ingredient in efficient Eu3+ UC in our systems. The optimal Eu3+ concentration was determined to be 15 mol%, which is consistent with the earlier reported work.18 Different from the Er3+, Tm3+ and Ho3+ UC systems, the optimized concentration of Yb3+ was determined to be 5 mol% in our experiments, and the UC intensity tends to decrease with an increase in the Yb3+ content, which may be due to an increased probability of long-distance energy migration that carries excitation energy to the lattice or surface defects in high-symmetry unit cells.58

Decay curves and luminescence photographs of the corresponding samples in cyclohexane are shown in the left and right insets, respectively. Power density of excitation source is 2.4 W mm−2. 
To further validate the effectiveness of the core–shell structure on the enhancement of Eu3+ UCL and understand the ET processes, the decay curves of the obtained samples were measured at 592 nm emission (Fig. 2). The lifetimes of the Eu3+ (5D0) excited states were fitted to be 3.83 ms and 3.99 ms for the NaYF4 and NaLuF4 samples, respectively in accordance with a single exponential decay process, and a notable increase in the Eu3+ (5D0) lifetimes (5.96 ms and 5.63 ms) was observed in both the shell-coated NaYF4 and NaLuF4 samples. Moreover, the rising step of Eu3+ emitting level population after the consumption of the short excitation pulse is about 0.6 ms, which is much longer than the excitation pulse and is considered as a typical feature of an ETU process, very different from the decay curve of a cooperative UC process.59 The cooperative luminescence band of Yb3+ was not observed in NaYF4:Yb3+/Mn2+/Eu3+ (5/30/15 mol%) or NaLuF4:Yb3+/Mn2+/Eu3+ (5/30/15 mol%), which further confirms that the cooperative sensitization UC process is very weak in our experiment.26,31,40 From previously reported results on an exchange coupled Yb3+–Mn2+ dimer model in Mn2+ UC,35–40 it can be deduced that the Yb3+–Mn2+ dimer model may also be appropriate in NaYF4:Yb3+/Mn2+/Eu3+ and NaLuF4:Yb3+/Mn2+/Eu3+. From the crystallographic structure of α-NaYF4 (Fig. S9†), the distance between the nearest Na+ (Y3+) and Y3+ (Na+) is estimated to be 3.87 Å (ICSD 60257), and the Yb3+ or Mn2+ can substitute the positions of Na+ or Y3+ in α -NaYF4. Hence, the ion couples of Yb3+–Mn2+ are close enough to form Yb3+–Mn2+ dimers. In NaYF4:Yb3+/Mn2+/Eu3+ and NaLuF4:Yb3+/Mn2+/Eu3+ NCs, the Yb3+–Mn2+ dimer could act as a new kind of sensitizer to harvest energy of two 980 nm photons and transfer to the adjacent Eu3+ ion for efficient Eu3+ UC emission.
To gain insight into the UCL mechanism, the study of pump power density dependence on UCL intensity was conducted. In a multiphoton UC process, the dependence of the UCL intensity (I) on the pump power density (P) follows the relation I ∝ Pn, where the number of pumping photons (n) required to populate the upper state can be determined from the slope of the UCL intensity versus the pump power density in a double logarithmic plot.60 As illustrated in Fig. 3, the fitted slopes of the 5D0 → 7F1 (592 nm), 5D0 → 7F2 (609 nm) and 5D0 → 7F4 (700 nm) emissions for NaYF4 and NaLuF4 samples were determined to be 2.24, 2.23, 2.10 and 2.25, 2.23, 2.08, respectively, indicating a two-photon process involved, which is in good agreement with the population of the 5D0 level of Eu3+ from the energy transfer of upconverted sensitization of |2F7/2,4T1> state of Yb3+–Mn2+ dimer.

The energy level diagrams of the Yb3+–Mn2+ dimer and Eu3+ ion along with the proposed UC mechanism are shown in Fig. 4. Firstly, the excited state |2F7/2,4T1> of the Yb3+–Mn2+ dimer can be populated by sequentially absorbing two 980 nm photons via the GSA process (|2F7/2,6A1> → |2F5/2,6A1>) and ESA process (|2F5/2,6A1> → |2F7/2,4T1>). Then, the excited Yb3+–Mn2+ dimer drops back to the ground state |2F7/2,6A1> while transferring the energy to a nearby Eu3+ ion to populate the emitting level of 5D0. Finally, the 5D0 level of Eu3+ can radiatively decay to 7F1–4 levels to generate intense luminescence at the wavelengths of 592 nm, 609 nm, 650 nm and 700 nm, respectively.

In vitro CT imaging
For further applications, the oleic acid capped UCNCs (OA-UCNCs) were modified with a poly(ethylene glycol)-conjugated phospholipid (DSPE-PEG2000) to yield water soluble PEG-UCNCs. The modified sample was characterized by FT-IR spectroscopy, and two new bands at 1724 cm−1 and 1109 cm−1, which can be attributed to the stretching vibration of the carboxyl ester and the ether bond of PEG chains appear, indicating the successful surface modification (Fig. S10†).61 To evaluate the in vitro CT imaging property of the core–shell NaLuF4:Yb3+/Mn2+/Eu3+ NCs, X-ray CT images were acquired using various concentrations of Lu-based PEG-UCNCs dispersed in deionized water (Fig. 5). The CT images became brighter, and the measured Hounsfield unit (HU) values of the Lu-based PEG-UCNCs increased with increase in concentration due to the high X-ray attenuation coefficients of the large atomic number rare-earth ions (Lu3+, Yb3+ and Eu3+). The in vitro CT imaging result is similar to previously reported Lu-based NCs,49–51 which indicates that our material is also a promising CT agent.

Ratiometric pH sensing
To realize pH sensing in the physiological pH range, two commonly used indicators, i.e. bromocresol green (BCG) and bromothymol blue (BTB), were used because the absorption spectra of their base forms perfectly overlap with the 5D0 → 7F1 (592 nm) and 5D0 → 7F2 (609 nm) UCL emission peaks of the UCNCs (Fig. 6a). From the absorption spectra of BCG and BTB in buffer solutions of different pH values (Fig. S11 and S12†), it can be easily found that the sensitive discoloration ranges are pH 3–6 for BCG and pH 6–8 for BTB, which is in accordance with the pKa of BCG (4.94) and BTB (6.82), respectively.62,63 In order to cover the entire physiological pH range, BCG and BTB were mixed together to expand the sensitive discoloration range to pH 3–8 (Fig. S13†). Furthermore, the UCL emission peak of 5D0 → 7F4 (700 nm) can be used as an internal reference because it is barely absorbed by the indicators, and its intensity remains constant with change in the pH value. The ratiometric pH sensing method based on an internal reference also eliminates the interferences caused by the variations in excitation intensity and other measurement conditions. Initial measurements were performed with dispersions of BCG, BTB and NaYF4-based PEG-UCNCs in buffer solutions with different pH values (Fig. S14†). To measure the pH values of flowing samples continuously, BCG, BTB and NaYF4-based PEG-UCNCs were introduced into a sensor film made of a biocompatible polyurethane hydrogel on a glass substrate (Fig. 6b). It is obvious that the UCL intensities of both the dispersion and sensor film samples decrease with increase in pH values. The reversibility of the sensor film in buffer solutions with different pH values was investigated as well (Fig. S15†). After several cycles, the response occurred rapidly between pH 3 and pH 8 within less than 30 s.

Conclusions
In summary, NaYF4:Yb3+/Mn2+/Eu3+ and NaLuF4:Yb3+/Mn2+/Eu3+ NCs were successfully synthesized by a modified LSS method and the intense orange upconversion luminescence of Eu3+ was efficiently achieved in the as-prepared materials for the first time. A core–shell strategy was employed to further increase the luminescent intensity. A new energy transfer mechanism for the Yb3+–Mn2+ dimer to Eu3+ ion in the Eu3+ UC process was proposed according to the exhaustive analysis of the experimental results. The prepared UCNCs were successfully applied in CT imaging and ratiometric pH sensing in the physiological pH range as well. The strong UCL emissions of Eu3+ endow lanthanide UC materials a novel selective emission at a wavelength around 592 nm for potential applications in multicolor imaging, multiplexed encoding and detection. Furthermore, this new mechanism to achieve intense Eu3+ UCL paves a new way for further promoting Eu3+ and other lanthanide UC materials.

Synthesis of NaYF4:Yb3+/Mn2+/Eu3+ NCs
In a typical procedure,42 a proportionally mixed water solution of YCl3, YbCl3, MnCl2 and EuCl3 (2 mL, 0.8 mmol of metal ions in total) was added to a mixed clear solution of NaOH (0.24 g), DI water (1.2 mL), ethanol (8 mL) and OA (4 mL) under continuous stirring. Then, 1.6 mL DI water containing 3.2 mmol of NaF was added dropwise to the mixture slowly. After vigorous stirring for 30 min at room temperature, the colloidal solution was transferred into a 20 mL Teflon-lined autoclave, sealed and heated at 200 ° C for 8 h. When the autoclave was cooled to room temperature naturally, the product was centrifuged and washed with ethanol for several times, and then re-dispersed in cyclohexane.
Synthesis of NaLuF4:Yb3+/Mn2+/Eu3+ NCs
The NaLuF4:Yb3+/Mn2+/Eu3+ NCs were prepared by the same procedure, except for using LuCl3·6H2O instead of YCl3·6H2O at the initial stage.

The epitaxial growth was performed according to a previous method with some modifications.53 A 0.5 mmol of as-prepared NaYF4:Yb3+/Mn2+/Eu3+ (5/30/15 mol%) core NCs, 1 mmol of Y(CF3COO)3 and 1 mmol of CF3COONa were added to a mixture of OA (6.5 mL) and ODE (6.5 mL) in a three-necked flask. The mixture was stirred under vacuum to remove oxygen at room temperature for 10 min. Then, the mixture was heated to 100 ° C with vigorous magnetic stirring in a temperature-controlled electromantle for 30 min to form a transparent solution and remove residual water under N2 flow. The solution was then heated to 250 ° C at a heating rate of 20 ° C min−1 and maintained at this temperature for 30 min under N2 atmosphere. When the mixture was cooled to room temperature, an excess amount of ethanol was added, and the product was collected by centrifugation and washed several times with ethanol, and then re-dispersed in cyclohexane.

The procedure is similar to the epitaxial growth of α-NaYF4 shell layer on NaYF4:Yb3+/Mn2+/Eu3+ NCs, except for using NaLuF4:Yb3+/Mn2+/Eu3+ (5/30/15 mol%) core NCs and Lu(CF3COO)3 instead of NaYF4:Yb3+/Mn2+/Eu3+ (5/30/15 mol%) core NCs and Y(CF3COO)3 at the initial stage.
PEG modification of OA-UCNCs
According to a typical method,42 a chloroform solution (20 mL) containing 200 mg of DSPE-PEG2000 was added to a chloroform dispersion (20 mL) containing 100 mg of core–shell OA-UCNCs with magnetic stirring in a round-bottomed flask. The mixture was stirred gently for 12 h. Then, the chloroform was evaporated using a rotary evaporator on a water bath at 30 ° C, and the solid was dispersed in DI water under ultrasonication, and then filtered through a 0.22 μm membrane filter. The excess DSPE-PEG2000 was removed by centrifugation.
Sensor film preparation
According to a literature method,63 BCG (1 mg) and BTB (1 mg) were dissolved in 1.6 g of a solution of 1.0 g of the polyurethane hydrogel D4 in 8.1 g of ethanol and 0.9 g of DI water by vigorous stirring. Then, 100 mg of NaYF4-based PEG-UCNCs were added and stirred for 10 h to form a homogeneous mixture. The sensor film was prepared by spreading the mixture onto a glass substrate and drying it at 60 ° C.
Characterization
The crystal structures and phase purities of the samples were analyzed by XRD. Measurements were performed on a Bruker D8 ADVANCE X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å) with an operation voltage and current maintained at 40 kV and 40 mA, respectively. TEM and HRTEM images were obtained with a FEI TECNAI G2 high-resolution transmission electron microscope operating at 200 kV. The UCL spectra were obtained by using a 980 nm laser diode and recorded by a triple grating monochromator (Spectra Pro-2758, Acton Research Corporation). The decay curve measurements were performed and analyzed with a LeCroy WaveRunner 6100 1 GHz oscilloscope. The FT-IR spectra were measured on a Bruker TENSOR 27 FT-IR spectrometer. The absorption spectra were measured on a Shimadzu UV-3600 UV-VIS-NIR spectrophotometer.

In vitro CT imaging
Various concentrations of Lu-based PEG-UCNCs (40, 20, 10, 5, 2.5, 1.25, 0.62, 0.31 mg mL−1) dispersed in DI water were encapsulated in 1.5 mL plastic tubes and arranged in a line on a plastic shelf. The measurement was conducted using a JL U.A NO.2 HOSP Philips iCT 256 slice scanner with parameters as follows: thickness, 0.9 mm; pitch, 0.99; voltage, 120 kVp; current, 300 mA; field of view, 350 mm; gantry rotation time, 0.5 s; table speed, 158.9 mm s−1.
Sensing of pH
The buffer solutions of different pH values were prepared by dissolving a proper amount of Na2HPO4·12H2O and citric acid monohydrate in DI water and were measured by a digital pH meter (Sartorius PB-10). The absorption spectra of BCG or BTB were measured by adding either 100 μ L of BCG ethanol solution (0.5 mg mL−1) or 100 μL BTB ethanol solution (0.5 mg mL−1) into 2 mL of each buffer solution, respectively. The absorption spectra of BCG and BTB mixture were measured by adding both 50 μL of BCG ethanol solution (0.5 mg mL−1) and 50 μL BTB ethanol solution (0.5 mg mL−1) into 2 mL of each buffer solution. The UCL spectra of PEG-UCNCs with BCG and BTB mixture were measured by adding 50 μL of BCG ethanol solution (1 mg mL−1), 50 μL of BTB ethanol solution (1 mg mL−1) and 20 mg of NaYF4-based PEG-UCNCs into 2 mL of each buffer solution. UCL spectra of the sensor film in buffer solutions of different pH values were measured by placing a sensor film in a cuvette containing each buffer solution.
