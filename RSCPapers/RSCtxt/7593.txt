    , Accepted 15th February 2020First published on 17th February 2020AbstractThe ubiquity of fossil fuels in the provision of mobility services and in the production of platform chemicals constitutes a substantial fraction of total anthropogenic CO2 emissions and resulting climate change. There is therefore substantial interest in the production of sustainable alternatives. Whilst much attention is directed to the individual elements in the value chain, there is a paucity of work focusing on the performance of the integrated system. To address this gap, we present a novel modelling framework for the design and scheduling of the production of platform chemicals and fuels from just air, water, and renewable energy throughout the year. Optimal routes are determined for solar ammonia and methanol. A combination of hydrogen storage for balancing seasonal intermittency and battery storage for balancing daily intermittency is determined as optimal. It is found that nitrogen-based fuels may offer advantages over carbon-based fuels. The cost of intermittency of renewable energy inputs is found to be as much as two thirds of total cost, again varying by location. This reinforces that future design of chemical plants needs to include a treatment of intermittency and opens questions on how to operate sustainable plants – for instance, operating seasonally, or more flexibly.
1 Background and motivation
The production of platform chemicals and transport fuels currently depends on fossil fuels. These resources are necessarily finite in nature and their consumption is associated with the emission of greenhouse gases, and contribute to climate change.1–3 Furthermore, the current energy system has simultaneously created significant global dependence on some regions, whilst simultaneously imposing resource curse on others.4 There are arguments that moving towards a sustainable energy system could change this.5,6
Processes and production systems with no fossil inputs and exclusively renewable energy sources can be expected to require new approaches in terms of design and operation. Yet most sustainable chemicals and fuels concepts incorporate the a priori assumption of carbon-based chemicals and of traditional process design. This study challenges two paradigms: firstly, carbon-based chemicals as the basis of fuels; and secondly, the design of chemical plants assuming inputs of constant cost and availability.
In a future where fuels are no longer made from fossil resources, many imagine a concept referred to as the circular economy.7Fig. 1 shows the concept of circular economy applied to fuels. Key elemental building blocks like H2, N2 and CO2 can be produced from abundant resources such as air and water and subsequently converted into more complex compounds. These, in turn, can be stored, transported, and finally consumed, producing as waste products the original chemical building blocks. When the energy inputs for the various conversions are provided by renewable energy, this represents a wholly sustainable cycle of producing fuels and platform chemicals.
 Fig. 1  Concept of circular economy for fuels. 
The scientific community is exploring various approaches to the sustainable production of platform chemicals and fuels. Several of them are based on using renewable energy to run water electrolysis and produce green hydrogen, and the subsequent combination of that hydrogen with carbon to produce synthetic hydrocarbons. At low temperature, alkaline water electrolysis and polymer electrode electrolysis are commercially available,8 while solid oxide electrolysis is used at high temperature.9 Photocatalytic and photoelectrocatalytic hydrogen production methods are also being explored but not yet commercially available.10
In the provision of mobility services, production of high energy density liquid fuels from hydrogen is even more important than in other sectors owing to the need to store and transport them. Furthermore, given the incumbent infrastructure, high energy density liquid fuels present a “drop-in” alternative to existing options.
Recent advances in direct air capture (DAC) have positioned CO2 as a key building block for so-called “sustainable fuels”.11 The dilute nature of atmospheric CO2 as a carbon source poses a challenge to its acquisition. Nevertheless, multiple technologies based on absorption and adsorption exist, some of which are available on pilot plant scale and others at a commercial level.12–15
Atmospheric CO2 can be used as an input to chemical processes, or to produce more valuable chemicals and fuels. This area of research is known as carbon capture and utilisation (CCU).16 Applications of this research include the catalytic hydrogenation of CO2 to produce methanol or formic acid (FA), as well as photochemical, electrochemical and photoelectrochemical routes.17,18 A plethora of more complex fuels can be synthesised using these routes, including dimethyl ether, ethylene, propylene, methane, and finally higher hydrocarbons via Fischer–Tropsch synthesis.17
Among the carbon-based sustainable fuels, methanol has received a very significant amount of attention.19,20 Owing to its higher boiling point compared to hydrogen it is easier to handle and store. Methanol's relatively high energy density renders it an attractive fuel and energy storage material compared to batteries and hydrogen (see Fig. 2). Considerable efforts exist towards improving conversion routes and catalysts to convert CO2 into methanol.21,22

Amidst the frequent conflation of the discussion surrounding the sustainable circular economy and climate change mitigation, it is important to recognise that carbon-based fuels made from captured carbon can be, at best, carbon neutral. As long as CO2 captured from air finds its way back into the atmosphere as combustion product, the use of these fuels can only decrease emissions stemming from fossil fuels and not provide negative emissions.23,24 Furthermore, scenarios where CO2 for fuels is captured from fossil-fired power stations or industrial facilities, as is sometimes proposed,11,25–27 will only correspond to partial decarbonisation, as they still result in the accumulation of fossil CO2 in the atmosphere. When deep decarbonisation is the goal, fuels made from exclusively renewable resources, such as air and water, may be considered. In this context, carbon-based fuels from atmospheric CO2 should be compared to fuels that are inherently carbon neutral – such as nitrogen-based sustainable fuels like ammonia.28 In a post-fossil fuel world it is not obvious that carbon-based fuels are the ultimate choice. Climate change notwithstanding, nitrogen is about 2000 times more abundant in the atmosphere than CO2. When moving towards a circular economy, nitrogen should therefore be closely examined as a potential building block for fuels and platform chemicals.
In this context, ammonia is a potential backbone compound for sustainable chemistry, and hydrogen storage.28,29 Its large role in fertiliser production could present an opportunity for decarbonising this aspect of the chemical industry.30 However, ammonia could also function as a sustainable fuel. It offers the same advantages as methanol in terms of ease of storage and transport as well as energy density. It can be combusted in a gas turbine or fed into a solid oxide fuel cell.31 Furthermore, in contrast to hydrogen and methanol, there is existing ammonia infrastructure owing to its use in fertiliser production.29,32 Not having to build an infrastructure around the fuel of the future might be a major advantage. Research is being conducted on so-called all-electric ammonia plants that use water electrolysis as hydrogen source instead of the traditional natural gas.33
Most proposed routes towards the sustainable production of platform chemicals and fuels rely on the use of intermittent renewable energy such as wind and solar in addition to battery technologies. Wind and solar energy deployment has been rapid in recent years and the sectors continue to grow while costs are being reduced.34,35 Simultaneously, the field of battery technologies is progressing rapidly.36 Essentially, all technological building blocks for a post-fossil economy – renewable energy technology, battery storage, air separation technologies, electrolysers, and synthesis plants – exist. Whilst little work has been done studying them as an integrated system, this concept does not rely on yet-to-be-developed technologies.
Specifically in the decarbonisation of the transport sector, specifically for heavy duty, and long distance applications, carbon-neutral synthetic fuels (CNSF) may have a place in addition to electric vehicles (EVs). The majority of fuels explored are carbon-based – in keeping with the paradigm of carbon-based fuels that has dominated for hundreds of years. It is worth pointing out that since long-distance transport inherently involves crossing national boundaries, no single country can make an isolated decision on the future of transport. Thus, in order for any specific CNSF to achieve the pre-eminence of gasoline, diesel or aviation fuels, international collaboration and consensus is required.
As has been alluded to above, there exists a significant body of work on the production of CNSFs. Almahdi et al.38 investigate methanol production from captured CO2 and green hydrogen. Matzen et al.39,40 and Tremel et al.41 perform techno-economic analysis for the production of multiple products, including methanol, dimethyl ether and ammonia using renewable energy. Herron et al.42 compile options for hydrogen production and methanol synthesis and compare them. DME synthesis from MeOH has been compared to synthesis directly from syngas, and different catalysts and reactor designs for DME synthesis were analysed in the literature.43,44 Work on ammonia includes techno-economic analysis of the aforementioned all-electric ammonia plants33,45 and exploration of electrosynthesis of ammonia.46 Sustainable production of formic acid has been modelled within efforts to find hydrogen carriers for energy storage and fuels.47
In most cases the control volume is drawn around the synthesis plant only, and time is not explicitly considered. This neglects the design and operation of the plants isolating the raw materials as well as the renewable energy facilities and disregards the integration of the synthesis in the larger framework of sustainable fuels production. Specifically, the time representation is often not suited to represent the varying nature of the renewable energy input. Moreover, renewable energy, and key raw materials, such as H2, CO2, etc., are assumed to be available at known constant cost and flowrate – avoiding the issue of varying input parameters. This allows for designing the system of interest the way one would design any chemical process – assuming all processes operate continuously and that electricity and heat are always available. Drawing the boundaries this way, however, does not tell the whole story around solar fuels and similar concepts. For instance, assuming continuous supply of renewable energy means neglecting the cost of the intermittency of the resource. This is particularly important in the context of suggestions of producing fuels and chemicals in remote areas.48 Ignoring the intermittency of the renewable energy can lead to underestimation of costs and to suboptimal design of processes. Designs which are produced without a consideration for time and intermittency will not be fit for purpose. An integrated study of how to schedule the entire process network is necessary to identify and resolve bottlenecks, ensuring the process operates as intended.
In this work we introduce an optimisation model for the comparison of routes for the production of chemicals and fuels from just air, water and renewable energy. The intermittency of renewable energy is explicitly modeled using hourly time representation and representative sequences of days. All electricity and heat used for the processes is required to be produced within the system. The boundary is drawn around air, water and renewable energy sources (solar radiation, wind, tidal waves, etc.).
We compare methanol and ammonia with regard to their potential as solar fuels. We examine the optimal schedule determined by the model and its impact on the design of processes based on renewable energy. The location dependency of the process design is investigated and implications for the future of energy systems are discussed.
The model formulation is detailed in Section 2, followed by an explanation of the data set used in the model in Section 3. Section 4 shows the results and Section 5 presents our conclusions.
2 Model formulation
The model formulation for analysing renewable fuels process chains requires a set of features. Chemical compounds, conversion and storage processes, along with their respective costs, need to be represented. Furthermore, heat integration and process flexibility are modelled. Time representation is of specific interest in the study due to the intermittent nature of the renewable energy source.
2.1 Time representation
In order to model the daily and seasonal fluctuation of renewable energy, sequences of days were chosen to represent the year. Groups of a number of ψl sequences are represented by one representative sequence, denoted by l. Every sequence consists of time periods t of length θt. The representative sequences of input data, such as PV capacity factor, are obtained by dividing a year of data into sequences of the desired length and choosing the representative based on the sequence closest to the mean for every ψl sequences. Various combinations of the sequence length and the number of sequences were analysed in previous work. It was found that six representative sequences of length twelve days in hourly resolution (ψl = 5) represent the year in sufficient detail while being computationally tractable at the same time. Hence this combination was chosen for this case study. The explicit representation of repeating sequences rather than single days is necessitated by the seasonal fluctuation of the solar radiation and the resulting need for seasonal storage of chemicals or electricity.
2.2 Processes and components

Fig. 3 shows the general structure of the model. Processes k produce and consume components i using flows Fkilt.
 Fig. 3  Structure of the model. 
The core of the model is inspired by reaction network flux analysis.49 Coefficients aki denote the specific amount of component i produced or consumed by process k in terms of mass flow. Eqn (1) relates the operating capacity of a process in a given time period Sklt to the flows in and out of the process Fkilt and the coefficients aki. Sklt denotes the operating capacity of the process in time period t in terms of kg h−1, kW, #modules, etc. Negative Fkilt and aki indicate that component i being consumed by process k while positive F and a indicate that it is being produced. (1)

Eqn (2)–(5) characterise the mass balances around the storage of materials and their consumption and production between consecutive time periods t and t + 1. Dilt denotes the amount of component i stored at the end of time period t in sequence l. D0il represents the storage level at the beginning of sequence l, i.e. at the beginning of the first time period in l. The surplus or deficit in storage over a sequence (Dil,n − D0il) is multiplied by (ψ − 1) to model the replication of the sequences and calculate the initial storage level of the next representative sequence. Note that NT and NL denote the final time period and the final sequence, respectively.

Eqn (6) and (7) ensure the storage level does not hit negative values or the installed storage capacity Ti during the repetition of the sequence. (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7)
For continuous processes the operating capacity of the process is constrained to be equal to the installed capacity Ck of the process in every time period: (8)
In order to implement cost scaling in the processes we implement binary variables yk for processes to indicate whether a process is installed or not. The following equations show the corresponding set-up enforcement which implements lower and upper bounds Cmink and Cmaxk if the process is used and then impose the installed capacity as bound on the operating capacity: (9) (10)
Analogous bounds are implemented for storage levels Dilt using minimum and maximum storage capacity Tmini and Tmaxi on the storage capacity Ti: (11) (12)
In order to allow for certain components to enter and leave the system, source flows and sink flows are defined. The source flow Fqilt and sink flow Fpilt are set to zero for components that are not sources or sinks. (13) (14)
The intermittent energy input is limited using an availability factor αiRElt: (15)
Since the system is based on renewable energy, some form of storage is required to balance the intermittency. In order to incorporate battery storage with a round trip efficiency, electricity is modelled differently from the other components. gk and ek denote the specific electricity generated or consumed by process k, respectively. Electricity flows generated by processes and fed to electricity storage are denoted by gprlt and gstlt, respectively. Electricity flows consumed by processes and taken from energy storage are denoted by eprlt and estlt, respectively. Eqn (16) and (17) sum up the energy produced and consumed by individual processes to the aggregate. Eqn (18) equates the flows produced by processes and directly consumed by other processes. Eqn (19) and (20) represent the balance in state of charge of the electricity storage between time periods t and t + 1. The flow out of the battery estlt is penalized by the round trip efficiency η. (16) (17) (18) (19) (20)
2.3 Heat integration
Heating is not treated as utility available at a certain price in this work. All heat used for processes needs to be provided by other processes hence heat integration is modelled explicitly. The model for heat integration is inspired by heat integration in distillation column sequence optimisation.50,51qck and Tck denote the heating requirement and temperature of a cold stream in process k. qhk and Thk denote the cooling requirement and temperature of a hot stream in process k. Qklt is the heat flow from process k to process ; the binary variable zklt indicates whether two streams exchange heat. Eqn (21) and (22) ensure that the heating and cooling requirements of the processes are satisfied by the heat flows. Eqn (23) and (24) enforce a minimum temperature approach (HRAT) for streams that exchange heat. (21) (22) (23) (24)
2.4 Production target and objective function

Eqn (25) imposes a production target in form of a lower bound on the product flow rate for a certain component. (25)
Since heating, cooling and electricity requirements are modelled explicitly, and all raw materials (air, water, and sunlight) are available at no cost, the variable OPEX costs are therefore assumed to be negligibly small. Furthermore, fixed OPEX, such as labour cost, is expected to be similar for all process chains as well as negligible compared to all other costs and consequently neglected as well. Hence the total cost is simply the sum of all CAPEX for storage and processes: (26)
2.5 Process flexibility
The presence of renewable energy inputs suggests that process flexibility may provide an important option for decreasing the cost of intermittency. A system that can follow the input may require less storage, hence the impact of process flexibility on the system is evaluated. When flexibility is allowed, the constraint for continuous processes eqn (8) is replaced by eqn (27). The operating capacity of the process is allowed to vary around the installed capacity by a factor of the flexibility level φ. (27)
The model's decision variables are the binary variables xi and yk which determine if processes and storage are installed, the installed capacities Ti and Ck, the operating capacities Sklt, flows Fkilt, storage levels Dilt, D0ilt and source/sink flows Fqilt, Fpilt. This mixed integer linear (MILP) model was implemented in GAMS 25.0.3 and solved with CPLEX 12.8.0.0.
3 Data set
For the purposes of this study, a system based on solar energy as input is analysed. Two locations, London and Dubai, were chosen to examine differences in the system design for different weather patterns. The data for the PV capacity factor αsollt was obtained from renewables.ninja.52 Out of the year 2014 in hourly resolution, 6 sequences of 12 days length each are used as time representation, corresponding to ψ = 5. These sequences include the sequences with the largest and the smallest average capacity factors. A comprehensive set of possible sequences was evaluated, leading to the conclusion that this combination leads to an acceptably small error compared to evaluating the full 365 days, whilst still being computationally tractable. Fig. 4 shows one year of PV data for both locations as well as the representative sequences, highlighting the higher seasonality in the London profile.

Methanol and ammonia are evaluated as archetypal products. The process networks are shown in Fig. 5 and 6. Of course, they only represent a subset of the routes available in literature. The routes used in this work were chosen because they are believed to be the most promising and technologically ready for the two final products.

 Fig. 6  Process network for ammonia. 
The process data used in the dataset are detailed in Tables 3 and 4 in the Appendix. For PV and the electrolysers as well as DAC based on Climeworks technology15 (DAC-CW) constant unit costs are assumed since the sizing and costing is based on area. For chemical plants (DAC based on Carbon Engineering technology (DAC-CE), air separation (ASU), MeOH synthesis and NH3 synthesis) scaling is assumed in line with a standard 0.6 capacity power law. A linear function was fitted to the data points, yielding the fixed and variable cost. DAC based on Carbon Engineering Technology14 was originally designed using natural gas in the fluidised-bed calciner. Since the natural gas is not needed for the reaction and only used for direct heating and fluidisation it is assumed that it can be replaced by hydrogen of equivalent heat flow.
Cooling water (CW) is assumed to be available at a negligibly small cost to take up residual cooling duties. A H2 boiler is available to provide high temperature heat at the top of the heat transfer cascade.

Table 5 in the Appendix shows the storage data. Storage costs for gaseous components are assumed to be similar regardless of the gas. Storage costs for liquid components are assumed to be negligibly small compared to storage costs for gaseous components. A round trip efficiency of 80% is assumed for the battery storage. The minimum temperature difference for heat transfer is set at 10 K.
Production targets of 18.7 tonne per h (161 kta) and 20 tonne per h (172 kta) (continuously over the year) for MeOH and NH3, respectively, were chosen because they correspond to the same energy output based on lower heating values of MeOH and NH3.
All costs were converted to 2017 US dollars using the Chemical Engineering Plant Cost Index (CEPCI)53 and annual average conversion rates.54
Levelised costs were calculated on the basis of an economic lifetime of 20 years, an interest rate of 10%, and 8600 hours of annual operation.
4 Results and discussion
4.1 Optimal network and scheduling
For MeOH the optimal route depends on the location. In London it is determined via electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 to FA using electrical storage to balance out daily fluctuations as well as FA and hydrogen storage to balance the seasonality. In Dubai the optimal route consists of direct MeOH synthesis combined with hydrogen storage and battery storage. Fig. 7 details the costs for different routes in both locations. The fact that the FA route is the optimal route in London and the least optimal route in Dubai stems from the cost of intermittency. In London, using a flexible FA electrolyser allows for seasonal storage of FA instead of hydrogen, reducing the storage costs substantially. In Dubai the cost of intermittency is lower so the need for seasonal storage is lower. Consequently, storing liquids instead of gaseous components becomes a secondary issue and the less costly combination the one with the lower PV and electrolyser cost. In case of London, during the summer additional solar energy is used to produce more FA and H2 than consumed by the synthesis plant and fed into storage. During winter, FA and H2 from storage is used to compensate for the lower PV energy available. It appears the additional electrolyser and storage capacity needed to achieve this schedule is preferable to storing the electricity or building additional PV.

For NH3, H2 storage to balance the seasons and electrical storage for balancing daily fluctuations is chosen. Fig. 8 shows the optimal storage levels over the year for MeOH and NH3. Fig. 9 shows the PV capacity factor and the electrolyser level of operation in summer and winter. The optimal schedule has the electrolyser following the radiation pattern. Battery storage is used to provide enough electricity to operate the synthesis plant continuously.

For London as potential location, the largest contributors to the overall cost are PV and H2 storage for both MeOH and NH3. The costs for the synthesis plants in both cases are small relative to the costs of electrolysers, PV and hydrogen storage. For Dubai, the hydrogen storage cost is reduced to a small level, showing that the hydrogen storage is used to balance the seasonal availability of renewable energy. The use of hydrogen for balancing seasonal fluctuations is in agreement with the results of Gabrielli et al.55 who found that when using a time representation that allows seasonal storage this is how hydrogen is used.
Overall, the production cost of NH3 and MeOH is equal within the margin of error in London whereas in Dubai NH3 is less costly than MeOH. This can be explained by consideration of the flow of energy through the system. Fig. 11–13 illustrate the transformation of electricity from PV to intermediates and to the final products. The lower heating values (LHV) were used for H2, MeOH, FA, and NH3. For CO2 and N2 the flows are assumed to contain the energy required to produce them.

 Fig. 13  Flow of energy through the process system for NH3 in London. 
The optimal PV capacity necessary for year-long operation determined by the optimisation produces a surplus of electricity during the summer. This electricity is not transformed into liquid product and would have to be curtailed. Some of the electricity is temporarily stored, resulting in some loss through the battery. Other losses are consequences of the efficiency of the electrolysers and the balances around the synthesis plants.
It appears that additional PV, electrolyser and H2 storage capacities are necessary in the MeOH process for the production and chemical activation of the CO2. In the case of NH3 the N2 can be obtained at negligible additional energetic cost. The DAC blocks require higher energy input in form of H2 and heat that in turn require a larger electrolyser and higher H2 storage and PV capacity. The advantage of NH3 over MeOH is a result of the fact that not only is CO2 highly stable and requires a high energy input for its reduction but also N2 is significantly more abundant in the atmosphere and its separation from air is easier than that of CO2.
It is worth pointing out that the cost of the synthesis plant is less than 5% of the total cost in every case. Consequently, the value of improved catalysis is small relative to reducing the cost of H2 storage, electrolysers, and PV technology.
4.3 Comparison to other sustainable fuels
It is generally accepted that, in order to be a viable option, a fuel needs to have an energy returned on energy invested (EROI) of at least three.56,57 Historically, the EROI of a fuel is used to compare fuel producing technologies, the objective being to generate the most amount of fuel using the least amount of energy input into the production process. With regard to the air and water-based fuels analysed here, the EROI provides a comparison of the upfront investment of energy into the production facilities and the energy delivered by the installation over its lifetime. We compare the EROI of different technologies as a measure of overall efficiency.
Since all energy required for utilities is produced using solar power and solar hydrogen, the hypothetical methanol/ammonia production facilities require no external energy input during their operation. The only energy necessary is the embodied energy of the plant and the energy necessary for the construction, etc. Since the production of PV panels is energy intensive, EROIs are calculated under the assumption that the embodied energy of the PV plant dominates the total energy and the energy requirements for constructing the hydrogen storage, synthesis plant, etc., can be neglected. An EROI of 10 for PV and a lifetime of 20 years are assumed,34,58,59 leading to an estimated embodied energy EembPV of 2.4 TW h per GW PV capacity. Eqn (28) shows the calculation of the EROI of the fuels based on EembPV, the required PV capacity (CPV), the fuel output flow (F), the lifetime of the plant (LT), and lower heating value of the fuel (LHV): (28)

Table 2 shows the approximate EROIs calculated in this work in comparison to other sustainable fuels and conventional fossil fuels. The EROIs of solar MeOH and NH3 are substantially lower than the EROI of oil which might be anticipated, owing to the generally high energy density of fossil fuels. However, the EROIs of synthetic fuels are higher than those of biodiesel and algae-based biofuels, and in the same range as bioethanol. As PV technology improves, the EROI of PV may be as high as 20.58,59 This would increase the EROI of the solar fuels by a factor of 2, resulting in EROIs as high as 12 for the NH3/Dubai case. Therefore, on an energy basis, air and water-based fuels appear to be competitive with bio-based sustainable fuels.

With regard to land use and water use, a closer examination of the technologies is required to compare them to biofuel production technologies. There is substantial variation in the water use and land use depending on the supply chain of biomass production.62 It is important to note that when shifting towards sustainable fuels, the EROI as an indicator becomes less important and indicators such as water consumption gain significance.
4.4 Cost of intermittency
In order to analyse the impact of the fluctuation of the energy source the cost of intermittency was computed. We define it as the difference in total system cost between the optimal system with the actual PV profile and the optimal cost for a hypothetical system where the capacity factor is constant at the annual average. The latter is termed baseline cost since this would be the cost one would compute when designing a steady state plant and size the PV capacity according to the average capacity factor. The baseline cost, process and storage cost increases when applying the actual PV profile are illustrated in Fig. 14.
 Fig. 14  Cost of intermittency for the optimal routes. 
 Fig. 15  Reduction of cost due to allowed process flexibility for direct MeOH synthesis (London). 
The cost of intermittency in London constitutes up to two thirds of the total cost. That means that when one would design a system like this using an average capacity factor, one would calculate a cost of only a third of the cost actually required to run a plant with continuous output. This reinforces the need to model intermittency in production systems depending on renewable energy. Most of the cost of intermittency is storage cost for the seasonal storage of H2. The rest can be attributed to the battery storage needed and the additional electrolyser capacity.
As would be expected, the cost of intermittency is substantially lower in Dubai. Only a third of the total cost is caused by the intermittency in the radiation. This is due to the lower seasonal fluctuation.
The cost of intermittency explains the different optimal routes for MeOH production depending on the location. In London, with a strong seasonal variation, storage of gaseous components is avoided as much as possible and the route via FA is optimal because seasonal FA storage is cheaper than seasonal H2 storage. In Dubai, seasonal storage does not dominate the decision, instead the route with the least losses from solar energy to MeOH is optimal. This also suggests that novel fuel production technologies that are entirely flexible, i.e., do not require any seasonal storage, may be preferable in locations with high seasonal variation, even if they require higher capital costs.
These insights could have significant implications for the future of sustainable chemical processes. Production of chemicals could move towards countries with higher availability of renewable power. In regions with large seasonal variation in PV patterns the plant could operate in green mode during the summer and shut down or operate with alternative resources, such as biomass, in the winter. This would change the way chemical plants are designed, away from continuous operation towards an annual cycle following the resource availability. Alternatively, the balancing of the varying renewable input can be left to the power grid and a hypothetical future hydrogen grid, necessitating a discussion around the allocation of the cost of intermittency and which technologies are required on grid-level. Concepts depending on renewable energy must therefore include a detailed treatment of intermittency – otherwise the impact of intermittency on optimal design and cost can be massively underestimated.
4.5 Benefits of flexibility
Since it is evident that the fluctuation in the renewable energy input to the system increases the cost substantially, it seems logical that the cost would decrease when allowing for the system to operate more flexibly. The flexibility constraint in eqn (27) was implemented for the direct MeOH route, allowing the level of plant operation to vary throughout the year. The system was redesigned for flexibility levels of 10%, 20% and 50%. Of course implementing any one of these flexibility levels would be a deviation from classical chemical process design. Chemical processes are historically designed and optimised for continuous operation. A flexibility level of 50% in this study allows the plant at times to operate at half the installed capacity – a level of flexibility that would pose new challenges for process design and control.
The results in Fig. 16 show that the flexibility allows for the synthesis plant to run at a higher level during the summer and store MeOH. This reduces the H2 storage capacity needed and with it the total cost substantially. The costs for MeOH for each case are broken down in Fig. 15 and 17. Since the cost of intermittency is lower in Dubai, so is the cost reduction achieved by allowing for process flexibility.
 Fig. 16  MeOH synthesis plant operation as a function of allowed process flexibility (London). Fluctuations in time sequence 5 are due to optimality gap. 
 Fig. 17  Reduction of cost due to allowed process flexibility for direct MeOH synthesis (Dubai). 
The implications of depending on intermittent energy sources demonstrate that processes need to be studied as an integrated whole. Isolating the energy production can lead to misleading results. In this case, the need for and the sizing of the hydrogen storage depends heavily on the location and the corresponding radiation pattern. Modelling only the process and assuming renewable energy input at a fixed cost would not have provided this insight. Flexibly operating the plant, and taking flexibility into account when designing a plant has the potential of offering cost savings.
5 Conclusions
This work has shown that solar MeOH or NH3 cannot currently compete with traditional fuels in terms of cost. One must note, however, that current costs typically treat all environmental and ecological damage they create as externalities. The systems considered in this work would have less negative impacts on the environment and lower social cost. An analysis of the EROI concluded that MeOH and NH3 are as good as or better than biofuels from an energetic perspective. Moreover, the technological building blocks for post-fossil value chains, such as electrolysis, batteries, hydrogen storage, and MeOH or NH3 synthesis, are currently available. Obviously costs will need to decrease significantly before they are a realistic alternative to conventional options, and this work indicates that a prioritised list for cost reduction is hydrogen storage, solar PV, and water electrolysis. Perhaps surprisingly, reducing the capital or energy costs associated with the actual production of MeOH or NH3 will not meaningfully reduce overall costs. Interestingly, whilst PV parks of up to 2 GW exist,63 the production of electrolytic hydrogen will need to be significantly scaled up.
Further, carbon-based compounds, such as methanol, are not obviously the optimal choice for the sustainable provision of mobility services. Diversification from an exclusively carbon-based paradigm may be sensible, and alternatives, such as nitrogen-based fuels should therefore be carefully considered. Importantly, this does not only apply to fuels but also to other chemical services such as plastics, where silicon-based chemistries may emerge as important.
However, despite some arguments to the contrary, there remains a strong location dependence for systems based on solar energy. The cost of intermittency is as large as two thirds of the total cost and depends on the seasonal variability of the solar radiation. Whilst this can be reduced by increasing process flexibility, ceteris paribus, some regions will continue to have particular advantages in the provision of energy services to the world. The location dependency suggests that global disparities in terms of resources may remain part of the global energy system – shifting from oil and gas to solar radiation. The availability of renewable power could influence where plants are built and how they are operated, varying seasonally or more flexibly.
If the circular economy for fuels and chemicals is realised, it would change the way we think about chemical processes. Providing the power for the production of the building blocks is the main cost driver. If only renewable energy is used, the entire process becomes CAPEX driven – as opposed to OPEX driven traditional processes. This may have effects on the way plants are being financed and may present a hurdle to the deployment of air and water-to-fuel technologies. To this end, further research on the whole-systems analysis and optimisation of these value chains is a priority.
