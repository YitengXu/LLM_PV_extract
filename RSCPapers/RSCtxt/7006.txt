    , Accepted 9th November 2016First published on 10th November 2016Abstractn-Type doping of a semi-conducting polymer used as an electron-transporting layer in a perovskite solar cell doubles the performance of the device from 6.5% to 13.93% power-conversion efficiency. This provides a new opportunity for studying various electron transporting polymers in perovskite solar cells. The doped polymer film improves electron extraction from the photoexcited perovskite and the subsequent transport of electrons.
1. Introduction
The power-conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic–inorganic hybrid halide perovskite (CH3NH3PbI3 or CH3NH3PbClxI3−x) solar cells (PV-SCs) has been quickly improved in the past several years from 3.8% to 22.1% in a device configuration using mesoporous metal oxides as the electron-transport layer (ETL).1–6 p-i-n-Type planar-heterojunction (PHJ) PV-SC devices without the use of metal oxide ETLs have recently attracted attention because of their low-temperature fabrication and potential compatibility with a roll-to-roll process7 developed for the production of organic thin-film solar cells.8 However, the PCE of p-i-n devices is still around 19.3%,5 probably because of the inadequate design of their ETL and hole transport layer (HTL), the latter in particular. Despite the significant development of organic HTLs,9 we find very few kinds of organic ETLs in the literature,10 where fullerene derivatives, e.g., PCBM,11 dominate despite their rather low mobility of ≪1 cm2 V−1 s−1. Meanwhile, a number of D–A-type polymer semiconductors that show an electron mobility >1 cm2 V−1 s−1 have been widely used for organic field-effect transistors (OFETs),12,13 organic photovoltaic devices,14 and thermal electronic systems,15 and most recently, as ETLs in PV-SC devices. For example, several high-mobility n-type polymer semiconductors, such as poly{[N,N′-bis(2-octyldodecyl)-1,4,5,8-naphthalene diimide-2,6-diyl]-alt-5,5′-(2,2′-bithiophene)} (PNDI-2T) or poly{[N,N′-bis(alkyl)-1,4,5,8-naphthalene diimide-2,6-diyl-alt-5,5′-di(thiophen-2-yl)-2-(E)-2-(2-(thiophen-2-yl)vinyl)thiophene]} (PNVT-8), show PCE values of 8.15% with PNDI-2T/ZnO16 and, very recently, 16.7% with n-type polymers.17 To explore the potential of polymers as ETLs further, we considered a doping strategy to improve the bulk conductivity and electron-extraction ability of polymeric ETLs. The dopant (4-(1,3-dimethyl-2,3-dihydro-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)phenyl)dimethylamine (N-DMBI) improved the performance of OFETs18 and thermal electronics.15,19 We report here the doping effects of a PNDI-2 ETL with N-DMBI (see Fig. 1), which doubled the PCE of a PV-SC device from 6.5% (PNDI-2 only) to 13.93% (doped). The dopant N-DMBI not only increases the conductivity of polymeric ETLs, but also lowers the LUMO and HOMO levels, and as a consequence improves the electron extraction and hole blocking abilities of the doped HTL, respectively – an observation that is useful for perovskite solar cell applications of doped polymer materials. The doping thus provides a new strategy to exploit the full potential of polymeric ETLs for PV-SCs.

2. Results and discussion
We first describe our optimized device fabrication method using the doped polymer. We used a 4:1:1 molar mixture of methylammonium iodide (MAI), PbI2, and PbCl2 as precursor materials dissolved in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) at 65 °C for 12 h. We then spin-coated the precursor solution on glass/indium tin oxide (ITO)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS), followed by heating at 100 °C for 25 min and rapid cooling to room temperature under nitrogen.20 The quality of the PV layer was confirmed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses (Fig. S1†). We then spin-coated 10 mg of PNDI-2T dissolved in 1 mL o-dichlorobenzene (DCB) on the PV film to form an ETL. Alternatively, we added 5 wt% (relative to PNDI-2T) of N-DMBI to a 10 mg mL−1 PNDI-2T solution, and spin-coated it on the PV surface to form a PNDI-2T/N-DMBI ETL. The interface-modifying layer polyethylenimine (PEIE) in isopropanol (IPA) was spin-coated onto the ETL surface.21 Finally, 70 nm gold (Au) was deposited on the PEIE surface as a cathode under vacuum condition.
To investigate the effect of N-DMBI on the device performance, we fabricated PV-SCs with and without 5 wt% N-DMBI based on the device structure illustrated in Fig. 1b (glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PV/ETL/PEIE/Au). As shown in Fig. 2, the PV-SCs with PNDI-2T as the ETL showed the best PCE of 6.5%, which is similar to the literature report.16 Remarkably, the use of N-DMBI doubled the PCE to 13.93%, which stands as one of the highest values for planar-junction PV-SCs with PEDOT:PSS as the HTL and polymer as the ETL (Fig. 2a). The introduction of the N-DMBI resulted in 110% PCE enhancement by the improvement of the short-circuit current density (Jsc) from 18.03 to 21.23 mA cm−2 and the fill factor (FF) from 40.5% to 76.0%. The performance of this device was highly reproducible (average 12.7% PCE, Fig. 2b) as examined for nearly 70 devices from six batches. The use of the PEIE layer was not essential (13.93% with PEIE and 12.8% without, Fig. S2†). Control experiments using PCBM as the ETL showed a PCE of 13.24% with a PEIE layer and 10.28% without a PEIE layer (Fig. S2b†), suggesting that our doped polymer has a better contact with the Au electrode than PCBM. A stability experiment was performed and it was found that the PCE of solar cells with the doped ETL kept 85% of the original value after 150 hours, which was much better than that of solar cells with undoped ETL (which remained at 62% of the original value after 150 hours, see Fig. S3†).

(a) J–V curves of PV-SCs with PNDI-2T (red) and PNDI-2T with 5 wt% N-DMBI (blue) as the dopant at a scan rate of 0.01 V/0.01 s. (b) PCE histogram of 70 devices with the PNDI-2T/N-DMBI ETL. (c) The steady state power output of the best device at a voltage of 0.7 V. (d) External quantum efficiency (EQE) of the device with 5 wt% N-DMBI and without dopant. 
Although solar cells with an N-DMBI dopant show some J–V hysteresis upon Voc (open-circuit voltage)-to-Jsc and Jsc-to-Voc device sweeping (Fig. S4†), the photocurrent density and the PCE remained unchanged (13.0%) when we applied 0.7 V bias voltage to the best device under irradiation, suggesting that our SC is stable under this steady state. The stable output PCE is slightly lower than that calculated from the J–V curve, which might be due to the hysteresis effects. The hysteresis phenomenon could be decreased using a slower sweeping rate (Fig. S4c and d†). The external quantum efficiency (EQE) profile shown in Fig. 2d shows an integrated Jsc of 19.8 mA cm−2 for the device with PNDI-2T/5 wt% N-DMBI as the ETL layer, which is 6.7% lower than the Jsc from the J–V curve. This value is 3.9 mA cm−2 higher than that of the undoped one (integrated Jsc = 15.9 mA cm−2).
As summarized in Fig. 3, solar cells with the PNDI-2T and the 5 wt% N-DMBI ETL were very sensitive to the ETL thickness, which can be controlled through the spin-coating speed (see the Experimental part; for the devices' structure see Fig. 1b). For a device using a 50 nm thick ETL, open circuit voltage (Voc), FF, and Jsc were equally low and the PCE of the device was only 3%. As we decreased the ETL thickness to 35 nm, all parameters increased to give a PCE value of 12%. A device with a 20 nm thick ETL showed the best result of 13% PCE because of the improvement of Jsc and FF. However, when we furtherdecreased the thickness of ETL to 14 nm, the PCE of the device dropped to about 10% due to the decrease of Jsc, Voc and FF (see the J–V curve in Fig. S5†).

To probe the effects of N-DMBI doping of PNDI-2T, we examined the optical and physical properties of PNDI-2T with and without 5 wt% N-DMBI, as summarized in Fig. 4. We first analyzed the two samples using photoelectron yield spectroscopy (PYS).22 The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of PNDI-2T was −5.76 eV, as calculated from Fig. 4a. The N-DMBI doping lowered the HOMO level of the polymer film to −5.85 eV (Fig. 4b). The HOMO level decreased by 0.1 eV, and consequently the doped ETL can block holes more efficiently.23 The onset part of the UV-vis absorption spectra of the 20 nm thick doped polymer film on a quartz surface showed a little red shift compared to that of the undoped one. The band gaps estimated from the UV-vis absorption spectrum were 1.50 eV and 1.45 eV for PNDI-2T and PNDI-2T/5 wt% N-DMBI, respectively (Fig. 4c). From the PYS and optical gap data, we determined the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) to be −4.26 eV and −4.40 eV for PNDI-2T and PNDI-2T/5 wt% N-DMBI, respectively. The details of the energy level changes of PNDI-2T based on different dopant ratios are shown in Fig. 2d.

The lower HOMO and LUMO are possible reasons for the improvement of hole-blocking and electron-collecting abilities, respectively. This hypothesis was further verified by current–voltage and photoluminescence (PL) measurements. As shown in Fig. 5a, the device with PNDI-2T/5 wt% N-DMBI as the ETL has a relatively lower dark current and an upper shift in the onset, compared to that with PNDI-2T, which indicated that PNDI-2T/N-DMBI has a better hole-blocking ability than PNDI-2T.23Fig. 4d indicates that the PNDI-2T film on a 300 nm thick PV surface decreases the PL intensity of the PV layer by 59%; that is, the PNDI-2T film extracts electrons from the PV layer. Under the same conditions, the N-DMBI-doped PNDI-2T decreases the PL intensity of PV by 78%. We therefore conclude that the PNDI-2T/N-DMBI film is more strongly coupled electronically with the PV film than the undoped PNDI-2T.24 In conclusion, the N-DMBI doping increases the electron-extraction ability of the PNDI-2T film.

(b) The photoluminescence spectra of PV (red), PV with PNDI-2T (blue), and PV with PNDI-2T/5 wt% N-DMBI (green) based on 300 nm PV films on glass. The excitation wavelength was 520 nm. 
Neither PNDI-2T nor PNDI-2T/5 wt% N-DMBI on ITO showed any diffraction peaks from 3° to 30° except for the ITO peak (Fig. 6a). However, they showed a huge difference in conductivity, as shown in the I–V curves in Fig. 6b. The current increased from 0.003 to 4 μA at 50 V upon N-DMBI doping (σdoped ∼ 0.0011 S cm−1) –a 1000 times increase of the conductivity (see the Experiment part, σdoped/σnon-doped = Idoped/Inon-doped) accounting for the high performance of the solar cells using the doped ETL. The conductivity improvement probably originates from a radical species formed in the ETL upon doping (with a carrier density about 1017 cm3),19 as supported by the appearance of a signal that was confirmed experimentally by the UV-vis absorption spectra (new peaks between 1000 and 1600 nm) and electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy (radical signal generated based on the doped polymer) based on a slow-drying sample (Fig. S6†). Although the bulk-conductivity of ETLs is a major contributor to the series resistance (Rs) of solar cells, some interface problems also caused Rs and shunt resistance (Rsh) changes, which are two important factors for judging the electron extraction and transportation ability of ETLs in devices. Thus, we calculated the Rs and Rsh of the device with doped (Rs = 1.91 Ω cm2 and Rsh = 2020 Ω cm2) and non-doped (Rs = 34.3 Ω cm2 and Rsh = 623 Ω cm2) ETLs according to the J–V curves in Fig. 2a. The lower Rs and higher Rsh of the doped ETL than the undoped one in the solar cell indicated the improvement of Jsc and FF, respectively.

3. Conclusions
In summary, we have reported a proof-of-principle of a perovskite solar cell based on an n-type doped polymeric ETL with comparable performance to that of PCBM as ETL. The N-DMBI-doped PNDI-2T polymer film effectively extracted electrons from the photoexcited perovskite due to energy level tuning and transported electrons efficiently because of the 1000-times enhanced conductivity. Thus, the doping doubles the performance of the device from 6.5 to 13.93% PCE–a value comparable to or better than that of the device using a popular fullerene ETL.
4. Experimental
4.1 Thin-film XRD analysis
The XRD experiment was performed on a Rigaku SmartLab X-ray diffractometer equipped with a scintillation counter. The measurement employed Cu Kα line, focused radiation at 9 kW (45 kV, 200 mA) power using a 0.02° 2θ step scan from 3.0–40.0° with a scanning speed of 3° min−1.
4.2 Photoelectron yield spectra
Photoelectron yield spectra were obtained for different PNDI-2T thin films with or without N-DMBI coated on an ITO substrate. The HOMO level was estimated from the intersection of the base line (black) and linear-fit lines.
4.3 SEM observations
SEM observations were conducted on an FEI Magellan 400L equipped with an AMETEK/EDAX Genesis APEX4 at a landing voltage of 1 kV under a reduced pressure of 5 × 10−5 Pa. The thicknesses of the PEDOT:PSS, perovskite layer, and ETLs were determined using a Dektak 6M stylus profiler.
4.4 Conductivity measurement
To measure the I–V characteristics of polymer semiconductors, we fabricated devices on SiOx (470 nm)/Si wafer. The gold electrodes were prepared using photolithography. The channel length and width were 9 μm and 325 μm, respectively. An electron-transporting material with or without N-DMBI (10 mg mL−1 in DCB) was spin-coated at 3500 rpm on their surface in a glovebox and they were encapsulated before the measurements. The I–V characteristics of the device were measured by Keithley SCS 4200 in air, according to the equations of σ = 1/ρ, ρ = RS/L, and R = V/I, where σ is the conductivity, ρ is the resistivity, R is the resistance, L is the channel length, S is the area of the channel (thickness × width), V is the applied voltage, and I is the current. Since parameters of V, L and S for doped and undoped film in the device are the same, we can easily get σdoped/σnon-doped = ρnon-doped/ρdoped = (RS/L)non-doped/ (RS/L)doped = [(VS)/(IL)]non-doped/[(VS)/(IL)]doped = Idoped/Inon-doped.
4.5 Materials and device fabrication
Methylammonium iodide was synthesized using a previously described method. In a glovebox (N2 atmosphere), dry MAI, PbI2 (TCI, >98%), and PbCl2 (Aldrich, 99.999%) were dissolved in DMF (Tokyo Chemical Industry Co., 99.5%) at a molar ratio of 4:1:1 and stirred for 12 h at 65 °C.
The devices were fabricated according to the following typical procedure. An ITO layer on glass was used as the substrate with a sheet resistance of 8 Ω per square. The patterned ITO glass was ultrasonically cleaned using a surfactant, rinsed with water, and then subjected to 10 min UV-ozone treatment. A PEDOT:PSS solution (AI4083) was spin-coated onto the ITO surface at 500 rpm for 3 s and then at 3000 rpm for 30 s in air, and was annealed at 130 °C for 25 min under air and 20 min under N2. An electron-transporting layer PNDI-2T (without or with 5 wt% N-DMBI) 10 mg mL−1 in DCB was deposited by spin coating. The thickness of the ETL was controlled using the spin-coating speed (1500 rpm for 50 nm, 2500 rpm for 35 nm, and 3500 rpm for 20 nm). For the PCBM device, 30 mg mL−1 in DCB was spin-coated onto a PV layer at 1000 rpm for 60 s. PEIE (0.02 wt% in IPA), an interface-modifying layer, was spin-coated at 6000 rpm for 30 s. The top electrode (Au, 70 nm) was deposited via a metal shadow mask, which created a 2 mm stripe pattern perpendicular to the ITO stripe.
4.6 Evaluation of PV devices
Current–voltage sweeps were obtained on a Keithley 2400 source measurement unit controlled by a computer. The light source used to determine the PCE was an AM1.5G solar simulator system (Sumitomo Heavy Industries Advanced Machinery) with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2. The SCs were masked with a metal aperture to define the active area of 4 mm2.
