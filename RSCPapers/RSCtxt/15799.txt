The electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) is a promising technology for NH3 synthesis. By using first-principles calculation, a new class of single-atom catalysts (SACs), graphdiyne coordinated single transition metal atoms (TM@GDY, TM = Sc–Zn, Y–Cd, and La–Hg) were designed, and the NRR catalytic character of TM@GDY was systematically investigated. The results demonstrated that some TM@GDY (TM = Ti, V, Fe, Co, Zr, Rh, and Hf) monolayers exhibit better NRR activities than a Ru(0001) stepped surface. There is an obvious linear correlation between the limiting potential and the atomic N adsorption energy, which confirms that the N adsorption energy may be a descriptor for evaluation of the NRR catalytic performance. The V@GDY monolayer possesses the best NRR catalytic character with the lowest limiting potential of −0.67 V and the potential-limiting step (PLS) of *N2 → *NNH for both alternating and distal mechanisms. Our results highlight a new family of efficient and stable TM@GDY catalysts and provide useful guidelines for SAC development and practical applications.
1 Introduction
The conversion cycle of nitrogen compounds into each other is very important in nature, and has been successfully applied in multifarious pieces of energy conversion equipment.1,2 Among these cycles, ammonia (NH3) is a fundamental chemical for industry and agriculture, and to sustain human life.3 NH3 is easy to store, safe to transport, and a promising carbon-free hydrogen carrier with a high hydrogen content.4,5 The Haber–Bosch process is the present method for N2 → NH3, where the temperature is 400–500 °C and the pressure is 200–300 atm.6,7 This process accounts for 1.4% of the energy supply,8 resulting in serious environmental concerns.9,10 The electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) is an alternative technique for NH3 production, and this technology could realize low cost and high efficiency under ambient conditions.11–13 In addition, the NRR equipment can be powered by solar energy, wind energy, geothermal energy, hydro-energy, bio-energy, or ocean energy with high efficiency and low or no CO2 emission.14–17 Therefore, it is becoming increasingly imperative to develop high-performance, low-cost and environmentally benign electrocatalysts for N2 reduction.
Transition metal (TM) materials are usually used as efficient electrocatalysts for NRR, since the d-orbital electrons can induce the π-back donation process.18–20 To obtain electrocatalysts with low cost and high catalytic activity for commercial applications, metal nanoparticles have come into being, and these particles are normally dispersed on suitable substrate materials.21,22 This conformation can not only form more active sites but can also tailor the band structures of these systems, thus further enhancing their catalytic efficiency.23,24 With further downsizing of the metal particles to the real atomic level, single-atom catalysts (SACs) have been proposed and synthesized and have gained more and more attention.25–27 Such SACs show distinct selectivity and enhanced catalytic activity in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR),28,29 the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER),30,31 the oxygen evolution reaction (OER),30,32 the carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR),33–35 and NRR.22,36,37 SACs can achieve maximum atomic use and promote atom economy, which should be the supreme goal of nanocatalysts.38 However, atoms with high surface free energy may suffer from aggregation, when particle size is reduced.39 Nevertheless, the SACs are not isolated atoms but unique coordination configurations between the single metal atom and neighbouring nonmetallic atoms on the substrate.24,30 The substrate is key to manipulating the catalytic performance of SACs.23 In other words, the best platform could capture the metal atom effectively and prevent metal atoms from aggregating, which is pivotal to retaining the excellent catalytic activity of SACs.40 Up to now, metal oxides,25 graphene,41 g-C3N4,42 transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs),43 metal–organic frameworks (MOFs),44 and covalent-organic frameworks (COFs)45 have been developed as platforms for SACs for key chemical reactions. Remarkably, typical porous two-dimensional (2D) materials can provide binding sites to hold the single metal atom.
2D graphdiyne (GDY) is composed of sp-C and sp2-C atoms, and large-area GDY had been experimentally synthesized by Li et al.46 The pristine GDY possesses independent π-conjugated bonds and is composed of a benzene ring and diacetylenic linkages (–CC–CC–).47 The hybrid network of sp-C and sp2-C endows GDY with excellent properties, such as uniform pores and good chemical and mechanical stability.48 GDY with its outstanding properties has been used in a wide range of fields, including purification,49 energy storage,50 electronic devices,51,52 biomedical applications,53 and fuel cells.54 GDY is a superior candidate for dispersing the single transition metal (TM) atoms and has attracted a great deal of attention.55 The alkyne and aryl π-conjugated structure of GDY could capture TM atoms efficiently, and in turn the TM atoms could modulate the electronic structures of GDY systems.56 Recently, some theoretical studies have shown that single-atom Sc, Ti, and Ir embedded on GDY are thermally stable and have outstanding catalytic activity for CO oxidation.57,58 The synthesized Fe@GDY,59 Cu@GDY,60 Pt@GDY,61 and Pd@GDY62 SACs exhibit excellent HER performance. Fe–N–GDY displays an onset potential of 0.94 V and a limited current density of 5.4 mA cm−2.63 Co–N–GDY could exhibit excellent ORR catalytic ability similar to that of Pt/C.64 Designed SACs with atomically dispersed molybdenum atoms on GDY show both excellent selectivity and activity in NRR and HER in aqueous solutions at room temperature and pressure.65 More precisely, GDY with porous characteristics has great potential as a substrate to hold single TM atoms. To our knowledge, the catalytic behavior of TM@GDY SACs toward electrocatalytic NRR has not yet been reported systematically.
Inspired by the above studies, we systematically studied the geometries, stabilities, electronic structures, and NRR catalytic character of TM@GDY SACs (TM = Sc–Zn, Y–Cd, and La–Hg) using density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The theoretical evaluation shows that some of the TM@GDY (TM = Ti, V, Fe, Co, Zr, Rh, and Hf) monolayers exhibit better NRR activities than an Ru(0001) stepped surface. The obvious linear correlation between limiting potential and N adsorption energy indicates that the N adsorption energy may be a descriptor for evaluation of the NRR catalytic performance of TM@GDY. The V@GDY structure possesses the lowest limiting potential of −0.67 V and potential-limiting step (PLS) of *N2 → *NNH for both alternating and distal mechanisms. The study presented here suggests that TM@GDY nanomaterials are promising SACs toward NRR.
2 Computational details
DFT computations were performed using the Vienna Ab Initio Simulation Package (VASP) with the ion cores represented by projector augmented wave (PAW) potentials.66 The electronic exchange and correlation effects were described within the generalized gradient approximation (GGA), as parameterized by Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE).67,68 The DFT-D3 method was adopted to describe the van der Waals (vdW) interactions.69 The cutoff energy was 500 eV. The Monkhorst–Pack 5 × 5 × 1 k-point mesh was employed. A finer 9 × 9 × 1 k-point grid was chosen for the density of states (DOS). The convergence of atomic forces was set to 0.002 eV Å−1. The vacuum space was 15 Å in the z-direction. The test results for different supercells and DFT+U are listed in Table S1 (ESI†), which indicates that the PBE results are acceptable in this work. The climbing image nudged elastic band (CI-NEB) was used to find the minimum-energy pathway (MEP).70 Bader charge was used to analyze electron transfer.71 The structural stability was studied via ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations with the canonical (NVT) ensemble.72
The binding energy (Eb) between the single TM atom and pristine GDY was defined by Eb = EGDY + ETM − ETM@GDY(1)the cohesive energy of bulk metal (Ecoh) was evaluated by Ecoh = ETM − ETM,bulk(2)and the energy difference (ΔEb) between the binding energy (Eb) and cohesive energy (Ecoh) was calculated by ΔEb = Eb − Ecoh(3)where EGDY, ETM@GDY, ETM and ETM,bulk are the energies of pristine GDY, TM@GDY, an isolated TM atom, and a bulk-metal atom, respectively. Usually, a criterion (ΔEb > −0.15 eV) suggests that TM@GDY is more favorable to be an SAC, which was suggested by the previous study.73
The adsorption energies (Eads) of reactive intermediates on TM@GDY monolayers were determined by Eads = Etot − Eadsorbate − ETM@GDY(4)where Etot and Eadsorbate are the total energies of the adsorbate–catalyst and the isolated adsorbate. According to the definition, a negative Eads indicates exothermic adsorption.
The reaction free energies were calculated based on the computational hydrogen electrode (CHE) model.74 VASPsol code with an implicit solvation model was used to simulate the electrolyte solution to deal with the solvation effect,75 and a relative permittivity of 80 was set for water.76 The reaction free energies (ΔG) were evaluated via the equation ΔG = ΔE + ΔEZPE − TΔS + ΔGU + ΔGpH + ΔGfield(5)where ΔE is the adsorption energy, ΔEZPE is the zero-point energy (ZPE), T is 298.15 K, and ΔS is the difference in entropy. ΔGU = eU, where U is the electrode potential, and e is the electron transfer. ΔGpH = kBT × ln10 × pH, where kB is the Boltzmann constant, and pH = 0 in this study. ΔGfield is ignored.74 The entropies and vibrational frequencies of the gas species were taken from the NIST database.77 The calculated ΔEZPE and TΔS are summarized in Table S2 (ESI†). The limiting potential (UL) is defined as the maximum free energy change (ΔGmax) among all elementary steps along the most favourable pathway using the relation UL = −ΔGmax/e.
3 Results and discussion
3.1 Adsorption of single TM atom
The pristine GDY monolayer was optimized, and the optimized lattice constant was 9.44 Å (Fig. S1, ESI†), which is consistent with previous theoretical results.78 The binding ability between GDY and a single TM atom [including the series of 3d (Sc–Zn), 4d (Y–Cd), and 5d (La–Hg) elements] was examined. The optimized geometries of TM@GDY are displayed in Fig. S2 (ESI†). There are three types of binding sites between TM and GDY. As shown in Fig. 1a, the Sc, Ti, Y, Zr, La, and Hf atoms are anchored next to –CC–CC–; the captured Zn, Cd, and Hg atoms are located above the plane of GDY (Fig. 1c); while the other TM atoms are anchored at the corner of an 18C-ring (Fig. 1b).79,80Fig. 1d and Table S3 (ESI†) depict the energy difference (ΔEb) between the binding energy (Eb) and cohesive energy (Ecoh). We take the criterion (ΔEb > −0.15 eV) to evaluate the structural stability,73 and the energy differences (ΔEb) of 3d-TM@GDY (3d-TM = Sc–Cu), 4d-TM@GDY (4d-TM = Y, Zr, Rh, Pd, and Ag), and 5d-TM@GDY (5d-TM = La, Hf, and Pt) are greater than −0.15 eV, confirming the stability of these TM@GDY systems.

3.2 Adsorption of N2 molecule
The pristine GDY does not capture N2 molecules efficiently with an adsorption energy of −0.07 eV (Fig. S3, ESI†). Different configurations (side-on and end-on) and adsorption sites for N2 adsorption were evaluated and are summarized in Fig. S4 (ESI†), and the adsorption energies [Eads(*N2)] are illustrated in Fig. 2a. It is clear that, for TM@GDY (TM = Sc, Cu, Y, Rh, Pd, Ag, and La), only end-on modes are stable, while both side-on and end-on configurations can exist when TM = Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Zr, Hf, but for Pt@GDY, the end-on configurations transform to side-on configurations after structural relaxation. The end-on patterns (except Cr@GDY and Pt@GDY) are more energetically favourable than the side-on modes. To further study the adsorption of an N2 molecule on TM@GDY, the distance between the TM atom and the N2 molecule (DTM–N) and the N–N bond length (LN–N) are illustrated in Fig. 2b and c. The DTM–N distance for side-on configurations is greater than that for end-on modes, which confirms the adsorption energies of the N2 molecule. The N–N bond length (LN–N) of side-on patterns (except Ni@GDY) are longer than those of end-on modes, which indicates that side-on modes have a greater advantage in the activation of a N2 molecule. For Pt@GDY, the adsorption energy is −0.12 eV, the distance between the N2 molecule and Pt@GDY is 3.57 Å, and the N–N bond length is 1.11 Å,81 which suggests that Pt@GDY exhibits poor NRR activity. In regard to the adsorption energies of N2 molecules, only the end-on modes of TM@GDY (except Cr@GDY) are further studied.

3.3 N2 electrocatalytic reduction reaction
The dissociative and associative pathways are two fundamental mechanisms of electrocatalytic NRR (Fig. 3).20 Along the dissociative pathway, the catalyst first captures the N2. Then breaking of the NN bond of the adsorbed N2 molecule takes place with high energy input, which explains why harsh conditions are required to follow the dissociative pathway.13 While for the associative pathway, the two N atoms remain bound to each other before the first NH3 molecule is formed. The associative mechanisms are different with different adsorption configurations of N2. The distal and alternating mechanisms are selected for the N2 end-on pattern, while the consecutive and enzymatic mechanisms are conducted for the N2 side-on mode. For both the distal and consecutive mechanisms, the proton (H+) continuously attacks one N atom until the first NH3 molecule is produced. For alternating and enzymatic mechanisms, the proton (H+) alternately bonds the two N atoms.82 Here, we study these two mechanisms separately and summarize the NRR mechanism in the following.
 Fig. 3  Different NRR pathways. 
The reaction (*N2 → *N + *N) is the first step of the dissociative pathway. Although the inert NN bond of N2 is activated, the direct dissociation reaction *N2 → *N + *N on the TM@GDY monolayers is still very difficult. We take V@GDY and Cr@GDY as examples. The dissociation reaction for the end-on configuration on V@GDY has a high energy barrier of 3.98 eV and is endothermic by 2.50 eV (Fig. S5, ESI†). For side-on mode on Cr@GDY, the reaction overcomes a high energy barrier of 3.99 eV and is endothermic by 1.89 eV (Fig. S5, ESI†), which is in line with previous investigations.83 Thus, the NRR associative mechanism is further discussed.
We firstly examine the first step * + N2 → *N2 on TM@GDY monolayers, which is often used as a criterion for NRR.18 The calculated free energy changes ΔG(*N2) of * + N2 → *N2 are depicted in Fig. 4a. The ΔG(*N2) for TM@GDY (TM = Sc, Ti, V, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Y, Zr, Rh, Pd, and Hf) are negative, which shows that they could spontaneously capture N2 molecules. In contrast, the ΔG(*N2) for Cr@GDY, Ag@GDY, La@GDY, and Pt@GDY are 0.12 eV, 0.05 eV, 0.07 eV, and 0.32 eV, respectively, which indicates that these TM@GDY (TM = Cr, Ag, La, and Pt) cannot effectively capture N2 molecules. Then, the first H+ + e− transfer reaction *N2 + H+ + e− → *NNH is examined, which is usually the potential-limiting step (PLS) for NRR.36 The calculated free energy changes ΔG(*NNH) for TM@GDY and the Ru(0001) stepped surface (taken as a ref. 19) are shown in Fig. 4b. The ΔG(*NNH) values for Ti@GDY, V@GDY, Fe@GDY, Co@GDY, Zr@GDY, Rh@GDY, and Hf@GDY are less than that of the Ru(0001) stepped surface, suggesting that they are potential candidates for NRR.

The entire NRR processes are further diagnosed for the optimized TM@GDY (TM = Sc, Ti, V, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Y, Zr, Rh, Pd, and Hf) catalysts with subsequent reactions. The free-energy diagrams via alternating, distal, enzymatic, and consecutive mechanisms are depicted in Fig. S6 (ESI†). To better exhibit the catalytic performance of various TM@GDY systems, the reaction pathway, potential-limiting step (PLS), and limiting potential (UL) are summarized in Table 1. The PLS for most TM@GDY surfaces are the initial protonation reaction (*N2 + H+ + e− → *NNH), demonstrating that the protonation of N2 is a pivotal step. While for the alternating pathway on Zr@GDY and Hf@GDY, the PLS are *NHNH2 + H+ + e− → *NH2NH2; for the distal pathway on Hf@GDY, the PLS is *NNH2 + H+ + e− → *N + NH3. Previous studies19,84 have shown that there is a relationship between the adsorption energy [Eads (*N)] of a single N atom on the catalysts and UL. Based on this method, the calculated UL and Eads(*N) are illustrated in Fig. 5a, and the data for ULvs. Eads(*N) provides an obvious linear correlation. Thus, the simple descriptor Eads(*N) could evaluate the NRR catalytic performance of TM@GDY systems. For example, V@GDY has a strong adsorption energy Eads(*N), and correspondingly small UL; while Ni@GDY and Pd@GDY have weak adsorption energy Eads(*N), and correspondingly large UL.

The UL is an important indicator to assess the NRR catalytic character of catalysts. The Ru(0001) stepped surface exhibits the best NRR catalytic performance among bulk metal catalysts.19 Therefore, the UL of various TM@GDY systems and Ru(0001) are summarized in Fig. 5b. The UL values of Sc@GDY, Mn@GDY, Ni@GDY, Cu@GDY, Y@GDY, Pd@GDY, and La@GDY are larger than that of the Ru(0001) stepped surface, suggesting that these TM@GDY are not good NRR catalysts. While the UL values of Ti@GDY, V@GDY, Fe@GDY, Co@GDY, Zr@GDY (distal), Rh@GDY, and Hf@GDY (distal) are smaller than that of Ru(0001), indicating that these TM@GDY catalysts are potential NRR candidates.
Theoretical and experimental investigation validates that HER is a major competitor for NRR due to the reaction taking place in aqueous solution.20,21 The adsorbed H atoms on the active sites lead to the low activity for NRR. In this regard, the reaction free energies of H adsorption [ΔG(*H)] for HER and N2 adsorption [ΔG(*N2)] for NRR could be used as simple descriptors to describe the reaction selectivity.85,86 As displayed in Fig. 5c, the ΔG(*H) of V@GDY, Fe@GDY, and Co@GDY are positive, while the ΔG(*H) of Ti@GDY, Zr@GDY, Rh@GDY, and Hf@GDY are negative. For Hf@GDY, the ΔG(*H) is more negative than ΔG(*N2), while for the other TM@GDY considered here, the ΔG(*N2) are more negative than ΔG(*H), which indicates that TM@GDY (TM = Ti, V, Fe, Co, Zr, and Rh) are better than Hf@GDY for NRR rather than HER in aqueous solution.
The V@GDY catalyst has a most promising application for NRR because of its effective N2 capture ability, high catalytic activity, and good NH3 selectivity. Here, we will further investigate the NRR process of V@GDY in the following. It is noted that adsorption energies of N2 molecule [Eads(*N2)] for end-on configuration are much stronger than that for side-on configuration by 0.32 eV, indicating that N2 molecules prefer to occupy the end-on configuration. Therefore, the NRR free energy diagrams of V@GDY via the distal and alternating pathways and the corresponding reaction species are depicted in Fig. 6. The next two steps along the alternating and distal pathways are exactly the same: i.e., N2 adsorption and protonation into *NNH. The reaction step of * + N2 → *N2 is downhill by −0.43 eV, suggesting that the V@GDY monolayer can capture the N2 molecule spontaneously. In comparison, the second step *N2 + H+ + e− → *NNH is endothermic with a ΔG(*NNH) of 0.67 eV. For the following steps of the distal route, the proton–electron (H+ + e−) pairs continuously bond to the distal N atom to generate the first NH3 molecule, then attack the remaining N atom to generate the second NH3 molecule, and the corresponding ΔG values are all negative. Thus, the reaction *N2 + H+ + e− → *NNH is the PLS for the distal route. For the alternating mechanism, the H+ + e− pairs attack the two N atoms alternately, and the corresponding ΔG values are 0.27, −0.53, 0.11, −2.00, and −0.13 eV, respectively. Obviously, the PLS of the alternating mechanism is also the first protonation step with an uphill value of 0.67 eV. All the reaction steps are exothermic, when the UL value of −0.67 V is applied. The desorption of the NH3 molecule is another determinant for an excellent NRR catalyst.11 Surprisingly, the desorption free energy [ΔG(*NH3)] of NH3 on V@GDY is only 0.75 eV. This value is more positive than that on W@N-doped graphyne (1.22 eV),87 V/β12 boron monolayer (1.14 eV),85 or B/g-C3N4 (1.79 eV),16 which indicates that the produced NH3 molecules can easily leave the V@GDY surface. In addition, the reaction intermediates are adsorbed on the V atom for V@GDY (Fig. 6c), indicating that the V atom is the reactive activity site.

Furthermore, we compared the catalytic activity of V@GDY with several excellent catalysts, and the results (including limiting potentials UL and PLS) are summarized in Table S4 (ESI†). The UL of V@GDY (0.67 V) is lower than that of most of the catalysts, such as Ru1–N3 (0.73 V),41 Ru1–N4 (0.77 V),41 MoS2 with Mo edge (0.68 V),88 Mo2C(111) (0.74 V),89 Ru1@C2N (0.96),37 or Ru(0001) stepped surface (0.94 V).19 Therefore, the stable V@GDY nanomaterial may be a promising SAC for nitrogen fixation.
3.4 Origin of catalytic activity
The density of states (DOS), band structure, charge and spin density distribution are pivotal to promoting reactions.90 The charge analysis is further conducted to investigate the outstanding catalytic efficiency of V@GDY. The electron density of V@GDY is presented in Fig. 7a, where the contour lines around the V atom indicate that the electron density increased, which is confirmed by the Bader charge analysis (Table 2). The C1 and C2 (denoted in Fig. 7a and b) atoms gain 0.11 e and 0.28 e, while the V atom loses 1.04 e, and behaves as an active activity site. Fig. 7b shows that the spin density is primary around the V atom, and the V@GDY monolayer possesses a total spin moment of 2.55 μB (Table S3, ESI†). The band structures of pristine GDY and the V@GDY monolayer are depicted in Fig. 7c and d. The pristine GDY possesses a direct band gap of 0.47 eV, which is very consistent with previous theoretical reports.91 While V@GDY shows a metallic character with a magnetic ground state because of the introduction of the occupied d orbital of the V atom (Fig. 7d and e). The intrinsic spin moment and metallic character could be responsible for the activation of the N2 molecule on the V@GDY monolayer and for the high catalytic efficiency, which is in agreement with the conclusion that magnetism within catalysts could improve reaction activity.82,83

To gain further insight into the activation of the N2 on V@GDY, the charge difference density (CDD) between the N2 molecule and V@GDY is presented in Fig. 8a. The electrons accumulate around the adsorbed N2 molecule, while the depletion areas of electrons are concentrated on the V atom, resulting in the enhanced activity of the N2 molecule. The results of Bader charge analysis confirm that there is about 0.24 e transfer from the V atom to the N2 molecule (Table 2), which supports the results of CDD. Moreover, the C1 and C2 atoms that are directly bonded to the V atom gain some electrons to enhance the C–V interactions. Fig. 8b shows that the spin density is mainly located on the V atom, and the N2/V@GDY systems possess a total magnetic moment of 1.44 μB. For a further display of the interaction between N2 and V@GDY, the DOS of N2/V@GDY systems and the free N2 molecule are depicted in Fig. 8c. A dramatic change can be found in the strength and shape of the occupied 2σ*, 1π, 3σ and unoccupied 1π* orbitals of adsorbed N2 on V@GDY. As shown in Fig. 8d, the V atom possesses two special mechanisms of interaction with N2. The empty d orbitals of V can receive the lone-pair electrons of N2, while the occupied d orbitals of V can offer electrons into the antibonding orbitals of N2. The strong hybridization among different orbitals validates the acceptance–donation mechanism, which is clearly exhibited in the DOS. The two N atoms have a repulsive interaction, which efficiently activates the NN. The results are in accordance with Bader charge analysis.

3.5 Stability of V@GDY
In accordance with the above discussion, the V atom is more favourably embedded in the corner of the 18C-hexagon and forms two kinds of V–C bonds with lengths of 2.07 Å and 2.12 Å (Fig. 9a). The calculated binding energy (Eb) between V and GDY is up to 5.33 eV. The CC can enable the px–py π/π* to point to TM atoms.92 The d electrons of the V atom have significant hybridization with the px, py, and pz orbitals of the C atoms of CC in GDY, which leads to a strong V@GDY structure. The energy differences (ΔEb) between the binding energy (Eb) and cohesive energy (Ecoh) on V@GDY is −0.04 eV, and the value of ΔEb further proves that the SAC of V@GDY is stable. Then, the dynamic stability of V@GDY is examined by the CI-NEB method, and the result is illustrated in Fig. 9a. The high energy barrier of 1.58 eV confirms the excellent dynamic stability of V@GDY. Additionally, we demonstrate the thermal stability of the V@GDY monolayer from AIMD calculations. The variations in total energy and temperature during AIMD and the final atomic configurations are shown in Fig. 9b. After simulating at 500 K for 6 ps, a slight distortion in the morphology and a slight oscillation in total energy confirm the outstanding thermodynamic stability.

4 Conclusions
In conclusion, we investigated the structures and chemical stability of a single transition metal atom anchored in GDY (TM@GDY, TM = Sc–Zn, Y–Cd, and La–Hg) using density functional theory calculations. The adsorption behavior of an N2 molecule on TM@GDY was systematically studied, and the results showed that the end-on configurations are more energetically favorable than the side-on modes. The free energy diagrams showed that most TMs can enhance NRR catalytic character, that V@GDY possesses the best catalytic performance, with a limiting potential of −0.67 V, and that the PLS is *N2 → *NNH for both alternating and distal mechanisms. The N adsorption energy is a simple descriptor and can evaluate the catalytic character of TM@GDY systems. The results provide more guidance for the atomic design of highly efficient NRR electrocatalysts.
