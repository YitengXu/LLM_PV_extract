    , Accepted 10th July 2013First published on 11th July 2013AbstractMonoclinic LaPO4 nanocrystals doped with Yb3+ and Tb3+ ions were synthesised by co-precipitation followed by annealing at 900 °C. These materials exhibited intense luminescence under ultraviolet (UV) and near infrared (NIR) irradiation. The structural properties of the products were analysed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The obtained nanomaterials had a single phase, a spherical shape of nanocrystals and an average size of 42 ± 5 nm. The spectroscopic properties of LaPO4:Yb3+,Tb3+ nanocrystals were investigated in detail using excitation and emission spectra. Additionally, the luminescence lifetimes for both Tb3+ and Yb3+ ions were calculated from the measured decays. The optimal dopant concentrations were estimated with respect to the intensity of luminescence. A cooperative energy transfer (CET) mechanism, which causes the observed up-conversion, was proposed because of the observed dependence of integral intensity on the power of the pumping laser. The calculated efficiencies of the CET were much higher than the efficiencies of the opposing quenching processes; these parameters were measured in samples doped with high amounts of Tb3+ ions. These materials demonstrated intense green up-conversion in addition to UV-excited emission.
1 Introduction
Recently, nanomaterials doped with lanthanide (Ln3+) ions have gained the attention of many areas, including materials science, chemistry and physics.1–4 The unique spectroscopic properties of these materials have been utilised in the design of efficient phosphors, lasers, optical devices, solar cells and security markers.5–11 In the life sciences, such as biology and medicine, researchers working during the last decade have begun to use nanomaterials doped with Ln3+ ions because of their spectroscopic properties.12–17 Applications, such as bio-imaging and photodynamic therapy, have been developed to take advantage of the luminescence of Ln3+ ions. A wide range of applications for these materials has developed because of the spectroscopic properties of the dopants; the Ln3+ ions and their characteristic f–f transitions cause the observed luminescence. Additionally, the 5s and 5p outer orbitals have shielding effects on the transitions within the 4f subshell. These factors facilitate the f–f transitions, which are partially forbidden by selection rules, as well as the relatively long luminescence lifetimes (ms), narrow line widths (several nm) and low absorption cross-sections of the Ln3+ ions.
The luminescent intensity of the Ln3+ ions can be enhanced in several ways. Charge transfer (CT) transitions can significantly increase the intensity of the luminescence displayed by materials composed of O2− and Eu3+ ions, such as oxides or oxyfluorides, excited by ultraviolet (UV) radiation.18 Additionally, the energy transfer (ET) between two or more Ln3+ ions can be utilised to improve the luminescent properties of phosphors. This process is especially effective when one of the Ln3+ ions undergoes an allowed f–d electron transition, which occurs in Ce3+ and Tb3+ doped materials.19 The ET mechanism can also be used to sensitise specially designed nanomaterials for excitation by a certain range of wavelengths. When the appropriate Ln3+ dopants are selected, it is possible to shift the absorbed wavelengths from the UV range to the visible (Vis) one via the down-conversion (DC) process. However, the reverse phenomenon is also possible; the up-conversion (UC) process usually results in the conversion of near infrared (NIR) radiation to visible light.16 What is more, appropriately selected Ln3+ can tune the colour of UC emission.17 The UC is especially interesting for biological applications. Additionally, narrow emission bands, large anti-Stokes shifts, resistance to photobleaching and relatively low toxicities make Ln3+-doped nanocrystals a good alternative for both quantum dots and organic fluorescent dyes. Materials that exhibit both DC and UC properties simultaneously are especially interesting, as well as extremely rare.
Recently, the research concerning advanced nanomaterials has focussed on multi-functionality, but this part is mostly realised by materials with concurrent luminescent and magnetic properties.20,21 Another group of multi-functional materials show dual-mode luminescence, which means they can be excited by both UV and NIR radiation.22 This property can be obtained in several ways. The luminescence caused by UV irradiation is due to the DC of excited light in the host material; in the second process, the UC occurs between dopant ions, which occurs in YNbO4:Yb3+,Er3+.22 In this situation, the colour of emission can be dependent on the excitation wavelengths. Dual-mode luminescence can also be obtained by forming hybrid nanomaterials.23,24 The two components in the material could demonstrate different types of luminescence. For example, mixing Gd2O3:Yb3+/Er3+, which exhibits UC, and Eu(DBM)3Phen, which shows classic luminescence, forms a hybrid material that could be sensitive to two ranges of excitation radiation.24 A much more advanced route is based on the formation of core/shell nanostructures; for example, a core with UC properties, which could be composed of Na(Y,Gd)F4:Yb3+,Er3+, could be covered with a NaGdF4:Ce3+,Tb3+ shell, which shows DC properties.25 The core/shell nanocrystals composed of NaGdF4:Yb3+,Tm3+/NaGdF4:Eu3+ are another example with a similar structure.26 However in this material, the UC of the core results in an energy transfer between the Tm3+ and Eu3+ ions, which causes a red emission from the Eu3+ ions. Dual-mode luminescence can also be obtained by selecting two different ions and doping them into one host, for example, red or green luminescence of NaYF4:Yb3+,Er3+,Eu3+/SiO2.27
Dual-mode luminescence is also possible in materials doped with only one type of activator, as we report here. Bright green dual-mode luminescence from Tb3+ ions was achieved by the simultaneous DC and UC in a single material, which was a monoclinic lanthanum phosphate LaPO4 when co-doped with Yb3+ ions.
The rare earth phosphates are good candidates for up-converting nanomaterials and have been broadly investigated since 2003.28–31 The emission properties of most of these materials are based on the energy transfer between Yb3+ and Er3+ or Tm3+ ions. However, we have proven that these materials could also be excellent hosts for less investigated systems, such as Yb3+/Tb3+ ion pairs.21 In addition to the useful spectroscopic behaviour, REPO4 have a number of advantageous properties, which include notably low solubility in water, high thermal stability, low thermal conductivity, high refractive indices and magnetic properties.21,32–34
2 Experimental
2.1 Materials
All reagents were of analytical quality or, in the case of rare earth oxides, had spectral purity. The following reagents were used for the synthesis of the materials: La2O3, Yb2O3 and Tb4O7 from Stanford Materials (United States, 99.999%), nitric acid HNO3 from POCh S.A. (Poland, ultra-pure), ammonium phosphate monobasic (NH4)H2PO4 from Sigma-Aldrich (Poland, ReagentPlus®, ≥98.5%) and glycerine from POCh S.A. (Poland, pure p.a., 99.9%). Rare earth oxides were dissolved in HNO3 to obtain their respective nitrates. The resultant 1 M solutions were used for further synthesis.
2.2 Synthesis of LaPO4:Yb3+,Tb3+ nanocrystals
The lanthanum phosphate nanocrystals, which were doped with Yb3+ and Tb3+ ions, were prepared using a two-step method. First, a co-precipitation method was used to synthesise doped hexagonal phosphates LaPO4·0.5H2O, which had a rhabdophane structure. Next, the prepared nanorods were annealed at 900 °C to transform them into monoclinic nanocrystals. The last step was necessary to remove any water molecules from the crystal network; water would quench the luminescence and heat treatment is necessary to receive the UC.
The procedure for obtaining the nanocrystals in the first stage was as follows: the reaction to synthesise 4 mmol of precipitate was carried out in a 25% solution of glycerine in distilled water. First, to a 100 mL of glycerine solution was added 125% of the stoichiometric amount of (NH4)H2PO4. Next, the solution was magnetically stirred and heated up to 50 °C. Concurrently, 50 mL of the mixed solutions of La(NO3)3, Yb(NO3)3 and Tb(NO3)3 were prepared by dissolving the appropriate volumes of the lanthanide nitrate solutions in a 25% solution of glycerine. The following concentrations of dopant ions were chosen: (i) static concentration of Yb3+ at 10 mol% and 10–45 mol% of Tb3+ ions and (ii) static concentration of Tb3+ ions at 40 mol% and varied for Yb3+ ions in the range of 2.5–20 mol%. After reaching the required temperature, the solution of Ln3+ nitrate was added to the solution of (NH4)H2PO4 using a dropping funnel over 15 min and under magnetic stirring. The reaction was maintained at approximately 50 °C for 30 minutes. The resultant white precipitate was centrifuged and washed several times with water and ethanol. The powders were dried for 24 h at 80 °C in air and annealed at 900 °C for 2 hours. The temperature was chosen based on literature reports and our previous studies.21,35
2.3 Characteristics of LaPO4:Yb3+,Tb3+ nanocrystals
Powder diffractograms were recorded on a Bruker AXS D8 Advance diffractometer in the Bragg–Brentano geometry, with Cu Kα1 radiation in a 2θ range from 6° to 60°. The reference data were taken from the Inorganic Crystal Structure Database (ICSD). Additionally, the diffractograms were used in the crystallographic data refinement with the Rietveld method.36 Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were recorded on a FEI Tecnai G2 20 X-TWIN transmission electron microscope, which used an accelerating voltage of 200 kV.
The composition of the two control materials was determined with an inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometer Varian ICP-OES VISTA-MPX. The composition of the samples was similar to the theoretical one. Analysed samples: LaPO4:5%Yb3+,40%Tb3+ and LaPO4:10%Yb3+,25% Tb3+ were doped with 6% Yb3+,42% Tb3+ and 11% Yb3+,25% Tb3+ respectively.
A Hitachi F-7000 Fluorescence Spectrophotometer with a 150 W xenon lamp was used to determine the luminescence properties (excitation and emission) of the samples at room temperature. Excitation and emission spectra were corrected for the instrumental response. For the up-conversion measurements, a solid state 980 nm laser (Dragon Lasers) was used as the excitation source. Emission lifetimes were measured at 545 nm (under the excitation of the 940 nm line of a Ti:sapphire laser, LOTIS TII Belarus with the repetition rate 10 Hz and the pulse width 5 ns) using a Jobin-Yvon THR 1000 spectrophotometer (1200 mm−1 holographic grating), a Hamamatsu R928 photomultiplier as a detector and a digital oscilloscope (LeCroy WaveSurfer 400) for data collection. The curve fit for the decay data was performed with a single and double decay model in Origin 9.0 software. The fit with the time traces was at least R2 = 0.998 and the errors were not larger than τerr < 0.01 ms.
3 Results and discussion
The synthetic method used to prepare LaPO4 nanocrystals is typically a wet chemistry approach, which is based on the co-precipitation reaction often used for synthesising nanocrystals.37–40 This useful method can only be applied for products that are insoluble in the reaction solvent. The presence of an additional compound, such as glycerine, inhibits the excessive growth of nanocrystals and reduces the degree of aggregation by adsorbing to their surface.
The rare earth orthophosphates (REPO4) can crystallise in four different phases depending on the ionic radius of the RE3+ ion.32 Light lanthanide phosphates are known to be monoclinic crystals with a monazite structure. Heavy RE3+ and Y3+ ions crystallise as tetragonal phosphate crystals with a xenotime structure or with a monoclinic churchite structure (both phases can be hydrated). All of the REPO4 compounds can also crystallise with a hexagonal rhabdophane structure (mostly as hydrated crystals). In our experiments, the precipitated products were composed of hexagonal LaPO4·0.5H2O nanorods, which transformed into monoclinic LaPO4 nanocrystals after annealing at 900 °C. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns taken of these materials are presented in Fig. 1. These experimental diffractograms match the reference pattern from the ICSD database, which is a monoclinic LaPO4 with a P21/n space group (ICSD #79747). All peaks were indexed and no impurities were detected. The dopant ions, which were Yb3+ and Tb3+, were neutral for the crystal system and phase composition. However, a small shift in the XRD peaks could be observed when compared with the reference data. The crystallographic data and structural refinement showed changes in the structural parameters with increased concentrations of dopants. The calculated cell volumes (presented in Fig. 2) changed drastically when the concentration of Tb3+ ions increased; even a larger effect was observed with changes in the concentration of Yb3+ ions. The difference in the ionic radius between the La3+ and Yb3+ or Tb3+ ions is responsible for this effect (shown in Fig. 2). Substitution of the La3+ ions in the crystallographic structure with smaller Yb3+ and Tb3+ reduces the dimensions of the crystal cell. This effect is especially apparent when the concentration of the smallest ions (Yb3+) increases (coordination number CN = 9, r(La3+) = 1.216 Å, r(Tb3+) = 1.095 Å, and r(Yb3+) = 1.042 Å).41 Notably, the crystal cell volume of the undoped LaPO4 is also larger than those in the reference data. The increase in the cell volume when compared to the single crystal reference is related to these size effects.42,43

TEM images of the as-prepared (co-precipitated) and annealed LaPO4 nanocrystals are presented in Fig. 3. The materials, which were synthesised via the co-precipitation method, were composed of LaPO4·0.5H2O nanorods with thicknesses of 5–10 nm and an average length of 55 nm. After annealing, a phase transition from a hexagonal to a monoclinic crystal structure had occurred and the nanorods were reformed as spherical crystals with an average size of 42 ± 5 nm (see TEM images). The rod- or wire-like morphology is typical for light (La–Gd) lanthanide phosphates when they are crystallised in the hexagonal rhabodphane phase.32,44–46 Heavy lanthanides (Ho–Lu) and Y crystallise as tetragonal crystals.28,32,47

The concentration of intermediate Tb3+ ions does not affect the morphology because TbPO4 can crystallise in both crystal systems and the presence of Yb3+ ions in the LaPO4 host should not change the structure in the range of concentrations to be used (2.5–20 mol%).
The removal of water from the materials and the change from a hexagonal to a monoclinic crystal structure resulted in an increased UV excited luminescence intensity and the appearance of an up-conversion emission, which was not observed in the as-prepared products. The monoclinic LaPO4:Yb3+,Tb3+ nanocrystals demonstrated intense green emission under UV (both wavelengths of a Hg lamp, 254 and 365 nm) or NIR (980 nm) excitations.
The luminescence excitation spectra, recorded in a range of 200–400 nm, are presented in Fig. 4. These spectra are characterised by broad excitation peaks, which have a maximum at 210 nm, and a series of narrow peaks at lower energies. The partially allowed character of 4f8 → 4f75d1 transition of Tb3+ ions causes the broad character and relatively high intensity of the first peak. This excitation peak is composed of the transition bands.

The promotion of the 4f electron to the excited 5d shell results in two excited states, which are the high spin 9DJ state and low spin 7DJ state.48 According to Hund's rule, the first of listed excited states has a lower energy and the 7FJ → 9DJ transition is spin-forbidden. The 7FJ → 7DJ transition, which is correlated with the bands at higher energies, is much more probable and therefore stronger.49 The remaining excitation peaks, which are in the range of 250–400 nm, are connected to the f–f transitions of the Tb3+ ions. These observed excitation peaks are the footprints of the excited Tb3+ ions, which are promoted from their 7F0 ground state to higher excited states. The Laporte forbidden character of the f–f transitions and the shielding effect caused by the 5s and 5d shells induce the narrow character and low intensities of the observed transition bands. However, the numerous transitions occurring in this range are still effectively absorbing UV energy and excite the Tb3+ ions.
From the depicted spectra, it is clear that increasing the concentration of Tb3+ ions does not have as strong an effect as increasing the amount of Yb3+ ions in the LaPO4 host. The 4f8 → 4f75d1 transition bands are almost completely quenched by excessive concentrations of Yb3+ ions (15 mol%). The role of Yb3+ ions is complex; besides acting as sensitisers for NIR radiation, they can also participate in the reverse process and play the quenching role in the down-conversion process for the NIR range.9,50,51 The higher excited states of the Tb3+ ions are especially vulnerable toward quenching processes. After an internal relaxation to the 5D4 excited state, cooperative energy transfer (CET), Tb3+(5D4) → 2Yb3+(2F5/2), can occur, which results in the decreased luminescence intensity of Tb3+ ions.52 There is also another method for quenching the 5D4 excited state of Tb3+ ions, which is phonon-assisted energy transfer (PAT) to Yb3+ ions.50,53–55 Additionally, the energy of the 4f75d1 state can also be transferred to the Yb3+ ions via the charge transfer state Tb4+–Yb2+.9 According to Yuan et al., the energy transfer for Tb3+(4f75d1) → 2Yb3+(2F5/2) is 10–100 times faster than internal relaxation of the Tb3+ ions to the 7F6 state. This assertion explains the results observed in Fig. 4, which displays the quenching of the 4f8 → 4f75d1 transition band by increasing the concentration of Yb3+ ions and relatively small changes in the bands connected to the transitions from the 5D4 level.
The emission spectra are shown in Fig. 5 and 6. The obtained nanomaterials exhibited intense green emission under UV light (365 nm), as presented in Fig. 5; this emission resulted from the transitions from the 5D4 excited state to the 7FJ ground state. The most intense band is located at 544 nm, which is characteristic of the emission of Tb3+ ions. The emission from the 5D3 level was not observed because the excited levels of the Tb3+ ions were quenched by cross-relaxation (CR) processes.56,57 Additionally, the intensities of the emission bands were similar and therefore not affected by changing the composition of the sample. The insets of Fig. 5 show the dependence of the integral luminescence intensity of Tb3+ ions on (a) Tb3+ or (b) Yb3+ concentrations. Increasing the concentration of Tb3+ ions promoted the cross-relaxation and the resonance energy transfer quenched the emission.48 Surprisingly, an initial increase in the integral luminescence of the Tb3+ ions was observed when the concentration of Yb3+ increased up to 10%. Generally, the Yb3+ ions are known to quench the Tb3+ emission. Increasing the concentration usually resulted in lowered emission intensity from the Tb3+ ions.58,9 In our samples, energy could be lost by multiphonon quenching and then transferred to neighbouring Yb3+ ions due to the high concentration of Tb3+ ions (40 mol%). If the number of excited Yb3+ ions is sufficient, then cooperative energy transfer can occur, which raises the 5D4 energy level of the Tb3+ ions.

For the up-conversion of LaPO4:Yb3+Tb3+ nanomaterials, excitation by 980 nm irradiation was efficient and, according to both the literature and our results, was based on the cooperative energy transfer between two Yb3+ ions and one Tb3+ ion.21,54,59,60 The emission spectra are presented in Fig. 6 and are similar to those obtained by UV excitation. The observed green up-conversion was optimised by selecting the appropriate concentrations of Tb3+ and Yb3+, which were 40 mol% and 10 mol% for Tb3+ and for Yb3+ ions, respectively, in the lanthanum phosphate matrix. The dependence of the integral emission intensity on the concentration of Tb3+ or Yb3+ ions is presented in the inset of Fig. 6a and b. Generally, increasing the concentration of Tb3+ ions up to 40% also increased the emission, but, above that concentration threshold, the Tb3+ ions were effectively quenched. In the experiments with Yb3+ ions, concentrations above 10 mol% caused quenching similar to that observed in the standard UV-excited luminescence.
The most common mechanisms of up-conversion are as follows: excited state absorption (ESA) and energy transfer up-conversion (ETU).61 The up-converting mechanisms in LaPO4:Yb3+,Tb3+ nanocrystals were assigned based on the registered luminescence decays and the dependence of the luminescence intensities on the power of the pumping laser.
In Fig. 7 are shown the luminescence decays of the LaPO4:Yb3+,Tb3+ nanocrystals excited by UV (355 nm) or NIR (940 nm) wavelengths. The luminescence decay of Tb3+ after UV excitation showed a typical pattern of decreasing emission intensity after the laser pulse; the luminescence lifetime was approximately 2.4 ms.57,62 This curve was typical for the direct excitation of Tb3+ ions, which was unexpected when using 940 nm as the excitation wavelength. The UC luminescence began from a relatively long rise in emission intensity, which was an effect of the energy transfer between the NIR-absorbing Yb3+ donors and Tb3+ acceptors. This phenomenon was a result of the pumping of the 5D4 excited level of the Tb3+ ions. The character and luminescence lifetime of the observed decay curve for the Yb3+ ions have validated the assertion that absorbed energy was transferred from Yb3+ to Tb3+ ions. The Tb3+ ions, in this case, played the quenching role for the Yb3+ emission. The luminescence decay curves of the Tb3+ emission after UV and NIR excitation, as well as the curves for the NIR-excited Yb3+, for all samples are presented in the ESI (Fig. S1†).
 Fig. 7  Luminescence decays of the LaPO4:Yb3+,Tb3+ nanocrystals. 
The calculations for the luminescence lifetimes were based on the registered decays and are presented in Fig. 8 as functions of Tb3+ or Yb3+ ion concentrations. The shapes of the measured curves were non-exponential because of the quenching processes. However, the decrease in lifetime may still be approximated by using an exponential function. The single exponential model for calculations of the luminescence lifetime values of Tb3+ and Yb3+ ions (Fig. 8a–d) was as follows: (1)where I represents the intensity at any time, I0 is the intensity at t = 0 and τ is the luminescence lifetime. The emission intensity of the Tb3+ ions excited by UV light (355 nm) decreased with increasing concentrations of Tb3+ and Yb3+ ions (Fig. 8a and b). This observation was the result of cross-relaxation between Tb3+ ions and the quenching of Tb3+ ions by Yb3+ ions, which occurred through CET or/and PAT pathways. Increasing the concentration of Tb3+ ions shortened the luminescence lifetime of the Yb3+ ions (Fig. 8c), particularly when the Tb3+ ion concentration was high. This is another confirmation of the energy migration from Yb3+ to Tb3+ ions. In Fig. 8d the dependence of Yb3+ ions' emission lifetime versus concentration of these ions is depicted. From the experimental results, it is clear that increasing the amount of Yb3+ ions in the LaPO4 matrix resulted in concentration-based quenching. The energy level scheme of the Yb3+ ion, which is presented in Fig. 10, has only two states: the ground 2F7/2 and the excited 2F5/2 state. Theoretically, the concentration-based quenching should be minimal and only observed in highly doped samples. However, the presence of Yb2+ ions in the matrix may facilitate the quenching of excited Yb3+ ions, as well.63 This pathway also seems probable in the presence of Tb3+ ions, which could form a Tb4+–Yb2+ CT state.9 The other possibility was the radiation- or self-trapping caused by the presence of resonant 2F7/2 ↔ 2F5/2 transitions between Yb3+ ions.64 The additional multiphonon relaxation processes dissipate the energy via nonradiative pathways.

Cooperative energy transfer efficiency ηCET (g) and backward energy transfer efficiency ηBT (h) as functions of Tb3+ or Yb3+ concentrations. 
The measured luminescence decay profiles of Tb3+ ions built up over time after excitation by 980 nm laser wavelength. Therefore, decays were fitted using the following equation:18 (2)where I0 is the initial luminescence intensity at time t = 0, I1 is the intensity added by energy transfer, and τr and τd are rise and decay times, respectively. This equation fits the decay profiles well for all samples. The calculated UC lifetimes are presented in Fig. 8e and f. Both the rise and decay times were dependent on the dopant concentration and became shorter with increasing amounts of Tb3+ or Yb3+ ions in the LaPO4 host. For the decay times, the dependence was the result of the quenching processes, which was similar to the effect observed when Tb3+ ions were excited by UV light. However, the observed shortening of rise times has a different reason. In more highly doped samples, the distance between the donor and acceptor ions is smaller and therefore energy transfer occurs faster.
The dependence of the integral luminescence intensity versus the pumping laser power (at 980 nm) was examined to fully analyse the nature of the processes involved. The relationship between the UC intensity IUC and the pumping intensity IP is given by the following equation: IUC = α(IP)n,(3)where α is a proportionality factor and the exponent n represents the number of photons in the UC process involved.65 In Fig. 9, points plotted using the log scale can be fitted with a linear function, which has a slope value of approximately 1.5–1.6. The obtained results raised suspicions that two photons were involved in the energy transfer between Tb3+ and Yb3+ ions, which agreed with the proposed CET mechanism.

The measured luminescence lifetimes can be used to estimate the efficiency of both cooperative and backward energy transfer between the Yb3+ and Tb3+ ions.54 The following equation was used to calculate the cooperative energy transfer efficiency ηCET for different Tb3+ ion concentrations:54,66 (4)where τYb–Tb is the lifetime of Yb3+ ions in the presence of Tb3+ and τYb is the lifetime of Yb3+ in the absence of Tb3+ ions. A backward energy transfer efficiency ηBT can be expressed as (5)where τTb–Yb is the lifetime of Tb3+ ions in the presence of Yb3+ and τTb is the lifetime of Tb3+ in the absence of Yb3+ ions. The calculated values of ηCET and ηBT are plotted in Fig. 8g and h. As shown in Fig. 8g and h, the energy transfer efficiency was considerably higher than the backward energy transfer for the more highly Tb3+-doped samples. This observation was in agreement with the earlier results regarding which Tb3+ and Yb3+ concentrations caused the most effective up-conversion (Fig. 6). The CET efficiency was enhanced with increasing Tb3+ doping. In Fig. 8g is shown the dependence of ηCETversus Tb3+ concentration. The calculated values of ηBT were small, which suggests that this process was not very efficient in the LaPO4 host material. Fig. 8h shows that ηBT saturates with the concentration Yb3+ at 20%.
A scheme mapping the possible energy processes occurring in the LaPO4:Yb3+,Tb3+ nanomaterials is presented in Fig. 10. This diagram summarises the interactions between the dopant ions that are responsible for the observed UV- and NIR-excited, dual-mode luminescence and other spectroscopic properties.
 Fig. 10  The proposed scheme of energetic processes occurring in the LaPO4:Yb3+,Tb3+ samples. 
After their excitation by UV irradiation (210 nm), the Tb3+ ions undergo relaxation processes to the first excited level, 5D4, from which the radiative transition emits the green light; this transition can occur with only a small loss of the energy to multiphonon relaxation (4) or cross-relaxation (2). However, the energy from the excited state of the Tb3+ ions can also be transferred to the energy levels of Yb3+ ions as a result of the charge transfer mechanism (3), and the cooperative energy transfer (1) or the phonon assisted energy transfer (5). The excitation of the Yb3+ ions under 980 nm wavelengths resulted in the CET processes toward the excited state energy levels of the Tb3+ ions (1). It was estimated by the analysis of ηCET and ηBT that this process was more efficient than any competitive backward energy transfer processes.
4 Conclusions
In the present work the series of the phase pure LaPO4 nanocrystals with an average size of 42 ± 5 nm co-doped with Yb3+/Tb3+ ions were synthesised using a co-precipitation method.
The effects of the particle size were mostly manifested in changes of the unit cell parameters leading to reduction of the cell volume. The size reduction also has indirect influence on the luminescence properties through higher probability of surface, structural defects and distribution of dopants due to the increased surface to volume ratio. Moreover, the crystal structure of the LaPO4 underwent morphological changes from hexagonal to monoclinic crystal systems as a result of the thermal treatment and the rod-like structures of the obtained materials were transferred to spherical nanocrystals.
The luminescent properties were improved by annealing the obtained hexagonal nanorods at 900 °C, which was crucial to achieve up-conversion as the result of dual-mode green emission. A detailed study of the up-conversion process revealed that the LaPO4 systems doped with Tb+3 and Yb+3 are adequate as hosts for anti-Stokes emission.
The excitation spectra indicated the presence of a charge transfer Tb3+ → Yb3+ mechanism, which caused emission quenching. The best dopants' concentrations were found. The brightest UV-excited emission was measured for LaPO4:10%Yb3+,15%Tb3+ and LaPO4:10%Yb3+,40%Tb3+ showed the most intense up-conversion. The built-up character of the luminescence decays confirmed that energy transfer occurred between the Yb3+ and Tb3+ ions, which was also responsible for the observed UC. The dependence of integral luminescence intensity on a pumping laser power affirmed that two photons participated in excitation of the Tb3+ ions. Additionally, the presence of other quenching processes, such as cross-relaxation between Tb3+ and Tb3+ ions as well as multiphonon quenching and other backward energy transfer from the excited states of the Tb3+ ions to the Yb3+ acceptors, was found. Moreover, the analysis of the CET from Yb3+ to Tb3+ ions and competitive quenching processes showed that the investigated system should be a good candidate to obtain intense up-conversion luminescence.
