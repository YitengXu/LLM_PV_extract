Herein, we report the ultraviolet (UV) saturable absorption and ultrafast photoexcited carrier-relaxation dynamics of BPQDs. The ultrasmall BPQDs are synthesized using a facile liquid-exfoliation method and possess a diameter of 3.8 ± 0.6 nm and a thickness of 1.5 ± 0.4 nm. Femtosecond open-aperture (OA) Z-scan measurements showed typical saturable absorption properties in the UV band. A negative nonlinear optical (NLO) absorption coefficient of −(1.4 ± 0.3) × 10−3 cm GW−1 and a saturable intensity of 6.6 ± 1.3 GW cm−2 were determined. Using a degenerate pump–probe technique, an ultrafast photoexcited carrier-recombination time was observed in the range of 216–305 fs, which was 3 orders of magnitude faster than that of BP nanosheets. Such an ultrafast relaxation component may be attributable to the edge- and step-mediated recombination and was confirmed by our density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This work provides fundamental insight into the underlying mechanism of the photoexcited carrier relaxation dynamic action in BPQDs which can enable UV photonic devices.
Introduction
As a new two-dimensional (2D) material, black phosphorus (BP) has attracted unprecedented attention owing to its great potential in applications such as electronics and optoelectronics.1–4 Similarly to graphene, monolayer BP can be obtained by mechanical exfoliation from the bulk BP crystal. Atomically thin BP possesses a puckered honeycomb crystal structure, which induces an interesting in-plane anisotropy in its optical and electrical properties.5–7 In addition, BP has a tuneable direct bandgap and a sufficiently high carrier mobility.7–10 The carrier mobility can approach 1000 cm2 V−2 s−1 at room temperature, and the thickness determines the direct bandgap, which varies from 0.3 eV (bulk BP) to a large bandgap of 2.0 eV (monolayer). Atomically thin BP nanosheets have been widely used in field-effect transistors,8,11 solar cells,12 p–n diodes,13 gas sensors,14 thermoelectric devices,15 and saturable absorbers.16–19 The synthesis, crystal structure, transport properties and electronic applications of 2D BP have been reviewed in ref. 1–3. Recently, Yu et al.20 developed an efficient strategy to enhance the stability of BP in air and water, which further promotes and extends the application of 2D BP materials.
Ultrasmall quantum dots (QDs) are another morphology of a 2D layered material and exhibit novel chemical and physical properties due to their quantum-confinement effect.21,22 Graphene and MoS2 QDs23–26 have been widely studied in previous work. Inspired by the attractive optical and photoelectronic applications of those 2D QDs, black phosphorus quantum dots (BPQDs) were prepared using a facile solution-based method.27–30 In proof-of-concept applications, BPQDs have exhibited remarkable performance in a flexible memory device27 and have exhibited good photothermal properties and biocompatibility.28 Yang et al.31 reported BPQD-based photocathodes for wideband bifacial dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). The power conversion efficiency of the BPQD-based DSSCs was 6.85%, which is almost 20% higher than that of the polyaniline cathode device (5.82%).
In photoelectronic applications, the carrier dynamics of 2D materials play a considerable role in determining the performance of photoelectronic devices.32,33 In recent years, the carrier dynamic response of BP nanosheets has been reported experimentally and theoretically.33–38 For example, Suess et al.35 performed polarization-resolved transient-transmission measurement of BP nanosheets. They obtained evidence of transient flips (180 ps) and slower enhanced absorption (1.3 ns). Based on angle-resolved pump–probe reflection spectroscopy, Ge et al.33 studied the dynamic response of the anisotropic properties of BP nanosheets under photoexcitation. Their results showed two relaxation times on the scales of 5.96 and 87.6 ps. He et al.36 also reported a photoexcited carrier lifetime that reached 100 ps. Our previous work demonstrated an ultrafast recovery time (less than 100 fs) and slow electron–hole recombination time (1.9 ps) for BP nanosheets.34 However, there are few published reports on the photoexcited carrier dynamic relaxation response of BPQDs. It is observed that the carrier dynamics is necessary to understand the quasi-equilibrium distribution excited carrier actions, which dominate the device performance.
In 1974, a CO2 laser39 was passively mode locked with a semiconductor saturable absorber. The development of ultrafast lasers based on semiconductor saturable absorbers has gone through half a century.40 In the past decade, the 2D-material-based generation of ultrashort pulses through mode-locking came true at visible and near-infrared wavelengths.17,41,42 However, to the best of our knowledge, there is almost no successful demonstration for the generation of ultrashort pulses through mode-locking at UV wavelengths. The lack of suitable UV saturable absorbers with saturable absorption and ultrafast recovery properties is one of the key factors.
The negative nonlinear optical (NLO) properties of BP nanosheets have also been reported in recent studies.16,34,41,42 Lu et al.41 have experimentally verified the broadband saturable absorption of multi-layer (10 nm) BP in different solvents (such as isopropyl alcohol, 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) and ethyl alcohol). An ultrafast saturable absorption of BP nanosheets of a different scale was observed at 800 nm by Guo et al.16 The broadband saturable absorption properties of BP nanosheets have also been confirmed by our previous work.34 Recently, Xu et al.43 measured BPQDs using a femtosecond laser Z-scan and obtained an excellent nonlinear optical response, with a modulation depth of 30% and a saturable intensity of 3.3 GW cm−2.
In this work, we perform femtosecond cross-polarized degenerate pump–probe experiments and conventional open-aperture (OA) Z-scan measurements at 370 nm to study the photoexcited carrier dynamics and NLO response of BPQDs. The BPQDs were synthesized from bulk BP crystals based on a facile liquid exfoliation method. The as-prepared BPQDs dispersed in NMP have an average diameter of 3.8 ± 0.6 nm and a thickness of 1.5 ± 0.4 nm and can be dispersed in NMP. The Z-scan measurement showed that the BPQDs possess remarkable saturable absorption properties, which implies that the BPQDs can be used as ultrafast saturable absorbers and Q-switchers. Pump–probe measurements were carried out to determine the carrier relaxation dynamics of the BPQDs. By fitting the decay traces, an ultrafast carrier lifetime in the range of 216–305 fs was obtained. Such a carrier lifetime is much shorter than that of the BP nanosheets, which approximately reach the picosecond time scale. We attribute such an ultrafast lifetime of the BPQDs to edge- and step-mediated recombination.
Results and discussion
Morphology and linear optical characterization of BPQDs

Fig. 1(a) exhibits the TEM and inset HRTEM images of the BPQDs. The lattice fringe is approximately 0.22 nm, corresponding to the (014) plane of crystalline BP. According to the statistical TEM analysis of 100 BPQDs in Fig. 1(b), the average lateral size of the BPQDs is 3.8 ± 0.6 nm. Fig. 1(c) shows the corresponding AFM image of the BPQDs, and the height profile along red line 1 is shown in the inset of Fig. 1(c). Fig. 1(d) depicts the statistical height analysis of 100 BPQDs. Statistical AFM analysis gives an average height of 1.5 ± 0.4 nm.

UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometry was carried out to determine the linear optical properties of the BPQDs dispersed in NMP. Two absorption peaks located near 310 and 370 nm are observed. Such a linear absorption response is in agreement with those reported in previous studies.16,27 The inset of Fig. 1(e) is an image of the BPQD/NMP suspensions in cuvettes. The BPQD suspensions appear uniformly yellowish, which suggests that the BPQDs have excellent stability in NMP. Raman spectroscopy was performed to characterize the internal structures of the BPQDs. As shown in Fig. 1(f), the Raman spectrum of the BPQDs shows typical peaks A1g, B2g, and A2g, at 361, 438, and 466 cm−1, respectively. The A1g peak at 361 cm−1 results from one out-of-plane phonon mode, and B2g and A2g are associated with two in-plane modes at 438 cm−1 and 466 cm−1, respectively. Compared to bulk BP, all Raman peaks of the BPQDs are red shifted, which agrees well with previous studies.11,28
Excitation intensity dependence of saturable absorption
To investigate the ultrafast NLO response of the BPQDs, we performed conventional OA Z-scan experiments44–46 on the BPQD suspensions at a near-UV wavelength of 370 nm. Two on-axis peak-excitation intensities, 0.44 GW cm−2 and 2.0 GW cm−2, were utilized to inject the sample.
The normalized transmittance as a function of sample position on the Z-axis is presented in Fig. 2. The typical “bell-shaped” OA Z-scan trace was observed for two excitation intensities. As the excitation intensity increases, the peak signal becomes much larger. These results indicate that the BPQDs possess a saturable absorption corresponding to negative NLO absorption. We believe that the bleaching of exciton absorption dominates the saturable absorption of BPQDs. The saturable absorption mechanism can be explained based on a two-level model:47 in the first stage, with weak excitation intensity whose photon energy is larger than the bandgap of BPQDs, the excited electrons from the low level (valence band) would occupy the state in the high level (conduction band); in the second stage, with the intense excitation intensity, all the available states in the conduction band are occupied by photoexcited carriers, due to the Pauli blocking principle, an optical bleaching effect occurs (i.e., saturable absorption). The detailed discussion and schematic diagram are shown in Fig. S1.†
 Fig. 2  OA Z scans of the BPQDs/NMP suspensions at 370 nm under different excitation intensities. 
To further understand the NLO response quantitatively, we extracted the NLO absorption coefficients of the BPQDs by fitting the Z-scan data using:48 (1)where q0 = αNLI0Leff, αNL is the NLO absorption coefficient, Leff = [1 − exp (−α0L)]/(−α0L), α0 is the linear optical absorption coefficient, and L is the sample path length. We obtained values of αNL = −(1.4 ± 0.3) × 10−3 cm GW−1 and −(0.4 ± 0.1) × 10−3 cm GW−1, corresponding to the on-axis peak irradiance of 0.4 GW cm−2 and 2.0 GW cm−2, respectively. The inset of Fig. 2 shows the dependence of the normalized transmittance on the excitation intensity, which is translated from the OA Z-scan curve under the peak intensity of 2.0 GW cm−2. The saturable absorption can be approximately fitted by the equation:49 (2)where L is the thickness of the sample, α0 is the linear coefficient, Is is the saturable intensity, and IZ = I0/(1 + Z2/Z02), in which I0 is the on-axis peak intensity and Z0 is the diffraction length of the beam. By fitting the experimental data shown in the inset of Fig. 2 with eqn (2), the saturable intensity was determined to be 6.6 ± 1.3 GW cm−2. To justify their utility for UV-SA, the nonlinear saturable absorption properties of different 2D materials and conventional semiconductors at near-UV and the other wavelengths are listed in Table 1. The BPQDs show an excellent UV saturable absorption response, which is close to those of BP nanosheets, graphene, and MoS2 in the visible region. Furthermore, the saturable intensity of BPQDs is much lower than that of BP and MoS2 nanosheets, which is in agreement with previous reports.43 Such a lower saturable intensity is helpful for the fabrication of semiconductor saturable absorbers because a higher saturable intensity would reduce the tendency for Q-switching instabilities induced by thermal effects.40 It suggests that the BPQDs have great potential in ultrafast photonics applications as UV saturable absorbers and Q-switchers.

Experimental results from pump–probe measurement
To evaluate the dynamic relaxation time of the observed nonlinearities and to gain insight into the underlying mechanism, cross-polarized femtosecond degenerate pump–probe measurements were performed at a near-UV wavelength of 370 nm. The excitation intensity of the probe beam was relatively weak, less than 10% in comparison with that of the pump beam. A polarizer crossed with the pump polarization was placed before the detector to minimize the pump scattering. Fig. 3(a–d) illustrate the degenerate transient transmission signals as a function of the probe delay for the BPQDs at different excitation intensities. The transient signals clearly exhibit an exponential decay. By fitting the transient signals with the exponential-component model y = A1e−(x−x0)/τ + y0, the dynamic relaxation time can be extracted as approximately 216–305 fs (average 0.25 ps) at different excitation intensities. Fig. 3(e) shows the relationship between the peak signal and the pump fluence. The peak signal is proportional to the pump fluence, which verifies the linear dependence of ΔT/T0 on the photoexcited carrier density. Table 2 summarizes the fast (τintraband) and slow (τinterband) dynamic relaxation times of different materials (other 2D materials and conventional semiconductors) at near-UV wavelengths. The photoexcited carrier lifetime is three or more orders of magnitude faster than that of the conventional, as shown in Table 2. We also listed out the photoexcited carrier lifetimes of 2D materials at other visible and near infrared wavelengths (Table S1†). It can be found that the interband recombination and relaxation rates of the BPQDs are approximately 1.4–7.6 times faster than those of BP nanosheets and several orders of magnitude faster than those of BP flakes, graphene, and MoS2 nanosheets. These results indicate that the BPQDs possess ultrafast dynamic responses in the UV band, and the underlying mechanism of ultrafast relaxation dynamics needs further exploration.

Fig. 4(a) illustrates the carrier relaxation time as a function of the excitation energy, which indicates that the carrier relaxation time is independent of the excitation intensity. We employed a 35 fs pulse laser with a low repetition rate of 2 kHz, and the pulse interval is 0.5 millisecond. Compared with the femtosecond relaxation process of BPQDs, the thermal effects on nonlinear absorption can be negligible. For such a fast component of the carrier lifetime, the exact mechanism is unclear. In the following section, a rational model is proposed to understand the mechanism of ultrafast relaxation dynamics in the BPQDs.
 Fig. 4  (a) Photoexcited carrier recombination time as a function of the excitation intensity, inset: schematic diagram of photoexcited carrier diffusion to the edges and steps. (b) Schematic diagram of the photoexcited carrier intraband relaxation and interband recombination processes. 
The effective relaxation time of a semiconductor is given by the following well-known equation:59,60 1/τ = 1/τintra + 1/τinter…, where τintra is the intraband relaxation time and τinter is the interband relaxation time, as shown in Fig. 4(b). Taking into account recent work on BP nanosheets of different sizes, we believe that the interband relaxation time τinter dominates the carrier lifetime extracted from our transient signals. We favour this explanation for the following reasons: first, in previous studies, the intraband relaxation time of BP nanosheets was determined to be less than 100 fs.34,52 In terms of quantum confinement effects, it is reasonable to assume that the intraband relaxation time of the BPQDs is much shorter than that of BP nanosheets (24 fs). The ultrafast intraband carrier–carrier scattering process is too fast to be resolved based on our measurement system. Second, Hu et al.37 observed the interband recombination times of BP nanosheets of different sizes by transient absorption spectroscopy. The existence of interband states at the edges and steps was confirmed experimentally. These interband states provide the primary recombination channel in BP nanosheets. For the BPQDs, the recombination of non-equilibrium carriers occurs by photoexcited carrier diffusion to the edges and steps, as shown in the schematic inset of Fig. 4(a). Based on the non-equilibrium carrier-diffusion theory,61 carrier-diffusion lengths can be expressed as: , where the diffusion coefficient D = μ(kT/e), in which μ is the carrier mobility of 50 cm2 V−1 s−1 (ref. 62), and e, k, and T are the elementary charge, Boltzmann constant, and temperature, respectively. We obtained a carrier-diffusion length of 5.3–6.3 nm using the equation described above (τ = 216–305 fs). These lengths are close to the lateral size of BPQDs, as characterized by TEM (3.8 ± 0.6 nm).
Density functional theory (DFT) calculations
To confirm the photoexcited carrier relaxation dynamic action, we simulated three BPQDs of different sizes and calculated their wave functions and energy levels of molecular orbitals, which are near the Fermi levels (the details can be found in the Experimental section). We calculated the energy levels and the corresponding frontier molecular orbitals, including the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO), HOMO−1, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and LUMO+1 for three different sizes of BPQDs, which include 38 phosphorus atoms (38P), 84 phosphorus atoms (84P) and 126 phosphorus atoms (126P), as shown in Fig. 5(a–c). The wave function is mainly localized at the edge for each system, which means that when an electron is excited from the valence band to the conduction band, the electron or hole is more likely to occupy the edge of the sample. Meanwhile, around the Fermi levels, the energy intervals between molecular orbitals decrease as the size of the BPQDs increases, which induce rapid recombination of the carriers on the edges. This result indicates that the recombination of non-equilibrium carriers occurs during the photoexcited carrier diffusion to the edges of the BPQDs. The simulation results qualitatively confirmed the edge- and step-mediated recombination mechanism described above. These results are also consistent with the previous work by Hu et al.37 which demonstrated that the carrier recombination relaxation time increases with the growth in the size of the BPQDs.

Conclusions
In summary, we synthesized ultrasmall BPQDs and studied the UV saturable absorption and ultrafast carrier relaxation dynamics. The BPQDs have a lateral size of 3.8 ± 0.6 nm and thickness of 1.5 ± 0.4 nm. Cross-polarized, degenerate pump–probe and conventional Z-scan measurements were performed on the BPQD suspension at 370 nm using a 35 fs pulse laser with a repetition rate of 2 kHz. The BPQDs demonstrate a nonlinear absorption coefficient of −(1.4 ± 0.3) × 10−3 cm GW−1 and a saturable absorption intensity of 6.6 ± 1.3 GW cm−2. An ultrafast photoexcited carrier recombination time of the BPQDs in the range of 216–305 fs was observed, which was explained by the edge- and step-mediated recombination model. This result suggests that the BPQDs are excellent alternative materials for ultra-broadband saturable absorbers.
Experimental section
Sample preparation and characterization
The ultrasmall BPQDs were synthesized utilizing a modified liquid exfoliation method, as reported previously.27,28 In brief, the liquid exfoliation involves ultrasound probe sonication followed by ice-bath sonication of the bulk BP powder in NMP. First, 10 mg of bulk BP powder was added into 2 mL of NMP in a mortar and then ground for 15 min in the Ar glove box (<0.1 ppm H2O and <0.1 ppm O2). Then the mixture was added to 3 mL of NMP in a 15 mL tube, and the tube and sonicator tip were sealed together with PDMS and Teflon tapes several times for preventing H2O and O2. The sample was sonicated with a sonicating tip for 3 h at a power of 1200 W, followed by sonication in an ice bath for 5 h. The supernatant containing ultrasmall BPQDs was obtained by centrifugation for 20 min at 7000 rpm.
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was performed using a Tecnai G2 F20 S-Twin transmission electron microscope at an acceleration voltage of 200 kV to obtain high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images. The corresponding atomic-force microscopy (AFM) image was taken on drop-cast flakes on Si/SiO2 substrates using an MFP-3D-S atomic force microscope (Asylum Research, USA) under the AC mode (tapping mode) in air. The UV-vis-NIR absorption spectrum was obtained on a Lambda25 spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer) with QS-grade quartz cuvettes at room temperature.
Femtosecond pump–probe and OA Z-scan measurements
The femtosecond laser pulse was delivered by an optical parametric amplifier (TOPAS, USF-UV2), which was pumped by the mode-locked Ti:Sapphire regenerative amplifier system (Spectra-Physics, Spitfire ACE-35F-2KXP, Maitai SP and Empower 30) with a repetition rate of 2 kHz. The laser was divided into two parts by using a beam splitter, and the pump and probe beams were focused on the sample by using an identical lens. The carrier dynamic relaxation was monitored by using a probe beam, which was time delayed by using a variable mechanical delay line. A light power detector (OPHIR, PD300 R-IR) was used to simultaneously record the transmitted laser power. The experimental setup for pump–probe measurement is shown in Fig. S2.† The pump–probe trace for the reference sample 0.3 mm ZnS single crystal is also depicted. The Z-scan technique was carried out to investigate the NLO absorption response of the BPQDs. The excitation laser pulses were introduced using the same laser system, and the wavelength was centred at 370 nm. The schematic of the conventional Z-scan measurement and OA Z-scan traces of ZnS single crystals are depicted in Fig. S3.† All the pump–probe and Z-scan experiments reported herein were performed at room temperature with excitation irradiances below the damage threshold. We further measured the absorption spectrum of the as-prepared BPQDs before and after the ultrafast laser measurement. As shown in Fig. S4,† no obvious change can be observed in the absorption spectra of BPQDs before and after the Z-scan measurements. It demonstrates that the BPQDs have not been degraded during the experiments. It means that the damage threshold of the material is higher than 2 GW cm−2 for femtosecond laser pulses.
DFT calculations
Our calculations were performed using DFT via the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP).63 We adopt the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) with the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE)64 exchange–correlation potential. The projected-augmented wave (PAW)65 was used with the cut-off energy set at 600 eV. The atomic position was allowed to relax until the change of the total energy was less than 10−7 eV and the residual force on the atom was less than 0.01 eV Å−1. The vacuum space between two neighbouring nanostructures was set to greater than 10 Å to decrease the effect of interactions. The wave function of the molecular orbital was plotted by Visualization for Electronic and Structural Analysis (VESTA).66
