    , Accepted 6th October 2020First published on 6th October 2020AbstractTransforming triplet excitons into singlet excitons is a topic of great interest to material scientists in order to surpass the exciton utilization efficiency (EUE) limit of 25% in electro-fluorescent devices. Towards this goal, the donor–acceptor strategy of molecular design has been proven to be an effective approach to obtain high electroluminescence (EL) efficiency. In this context, herein, we report two benzothiadiazole (BTD)-based donor–acceptor π-conjugated fluorescent molecules, 1 and 2, which exhibited an external quantum efficiency (EQE) as high as 7.0% and 8.1%, respectively, in solution-processed doped green OLED devices. The observed high photoluminescence (PL) quantum yield of 81% for 1 and 85% for 2 corroborate the high EUE values of 43% and 48%, respectively, exceeding the traditional limit (25%), hence suggest the utilization of triplet excitons. The reported emitters combine two parameters, i.e. high PL efficiency and high EUE, which are of key importance to harvest maximum EL in OLED devices. Based on the photophysical (solvatochromic experiment) and quantum chemical calculations, the impacts of the D–π–A–π–D molecular design on the regulation of the locally excited and charge transfer components were revealed, which explained the observed high EQE (>5%) and EUE (>25%) values for the BTD-based emitters. The development of emitters with a hybrid local and charge transfer state in combination with the ‘hot exciton’ mechanism is an important strategy to produce highly efficient fluorescent-emitter materials. Besides the impressive EL properties of the emitters, the studied compound 1 as a chemosensor showed the selective sensing of metal cation (Fe2+) and anion (I−) together with the staining agent of Hibiscus rosa-sinensis pollen grains.
Introduction
Since the pioneering work by C. W. Tang and S. Vanslyke with the fabrication of the first double-layer OLED device,1 scientists have focused on surpassing the exciton utilization efficiency (EUE) limit of 25% (corresponds to EQE of 5%) in electro-fluorescent devices. Many organic metal complexes and polymeric systems have successfully surpassed the EUE limit; however, the high cost of metals and batch-wise variations in polymers demand suitable alternatives for mass production. In metal-free fluorescent OLEDs, two well-studied mechanisms, viz. thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF)2–10 and hybrid local and charge transfer (HLCT),11–18 are responsible for achieving greater than 25% EUE. Both processes involve the use of triplet excitons via reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) from T1 to S1 in the case of TADF and Tn (n > 1) to Sn (n ≥ 1) in HLCT. Recently, donor–acceptor small π-conjugated organic molecules with HLCT characteristics have attracted significant attention since this type of molecule tactfully integrates two complementary properties of high photoluminescence (PL) quantum yield (ηPL) due to the low-lying locally excited (LE) state and high EUE owing to the high-lying charge transfer (CT) state, resulting in high external quantum efficiency (EQE) in the corresponding device.11,14,19 In this context, benzothiadiazole (BTD) derivatives are the most suitable candidates with excellent fluorescence behavior in the solution and solid state.20 Besides, the BTD framework acts as a strong acceptor unit and is actively used to tune energy levels for achieving low band-gap molecules suitable for various optoelectronic devices.21 Furthermore, structural modification with electron-donating groups result in the formation of a donor–acceptor system. Also, donor–acceptor fluorophores composed of small organic molecules have a high degree of control in their optical and electronic features due to the ease in structural variation.13,18,22–30 As a result, luminescent BTD derivatives have found potential use in a variety of applications, such as emitter materials in OLEDs,13,18,24–30 chemosensors,31 biological imaging,32 liquid crystals,33–35 and organic solar cells.36 The majority of BTD derivatives are employed in photovoltaic applications36 and as emitter materials13,18,24–30 in OLEDs. For example, Thomas and coworkers reported BTD-based red27 and green26 emitters showing decent EQE values of 2.1% and 4.6% in OLED devices, respectively. Ma's group reported several BTD-based donor–acceptor emitters with colors ranging from green13 to orange18 to deep red18 in non-doped OLEDs, which showed maximum EQEs of 6.95% to 3.80% to 2.80%, respectively. However, despite these advancements, low-cost solution-processed BTD-based highly efficient emitters are scarce, and thus need further development. Accordingly, herein, we describe the utilization of BTD derivatives 1 and 2 (Scheme 1 and Scheme S1, ESI†) as highly efficient fluorescent green emitter materials in solution-processed doped OLEDs with a high EQE of 7.0% and 8.1%, respectively. The breakthrough of the traditional EQE limit of fluorescent OLEDs (i.e. 5%) can be explained by the HLCT mechanism. The high ηPL and high EUE obtained for the reported BTD emitters contributed to the high EQE values of the OLED devices. RISC from the T2 to S1 state via a “hot exciton” channel is believed to be responsible for the large fraction of the radiative singlet excitons. In addition, the selective chemosensing of ions and staining of pollen grains ability of BTD derivative 1 was also investigated.

Results and discussion
Synthesis and photophysical studies
The detailed synthesis of the target BTD materials 1 and 2 is provided in the ESI† (Scheme S1). The final materials were characterized via the NMR, FT-IR, and HRMS techniques (Fig. S1–S6, ESI†). The absorption and emission behavior of the derivatives were checked in the solution state (in THF, 10−5 M) and in neat films obtained by drop-casting their millimolar solutions on quartz plates (Table 1, Fig. 1a, b and Fig. S7, ESI†). Both derivatives exhibited similar behavior in the solution state due to the presence of the same chromophoric BTD unit. Mainly two peaks were observed in the absorption spectra at 307 nm and 410 nm for 1 and 307 nm and 421 nm for 2. The peaks at the lower wavelength of 307 nm arise due to the π–π* transition, while the peak at a longer wavelength 410/421 nm (for 1/2) is likely ascribed to the CT transition from the electron-donating moiety to the electron-deficient chromophore. The simulated absorption spectrum of BTD derivative 2 in THF reproduces the key features of the experimental spectrum, as shown in Fig. S8a (ESI†). In the simulated/experimental UV-Vis spectrum, the observed intense band at 265/307 nm corresponds to the S0–S4 excited states and related to π–π* transition, as can be predicted from the corresponding natural transition orbitals (NTOs) (Table S2, ESI†). On the other hand, the band at 388/421 nm appeared due to the S0–S1 transition and consists of a CT component. Emission peaks at 549 nm for 1 and 547 nm for 2 were observed in the solution state, suggesting a green-colored emission, as can be seen from the insets of Fig. S7a (ESI†) and Fig. 1a, respectively. In the case of compound 1 in the thin-film state, the shift was not prominent (only 12 nm) and the emission peak was slightly red-shifted to 561 nm. On the other hand, in the case of 2, the emission peak almost remained unchanged from the solution state (547 nm) to the thin-film state (546 nm). The insignificant red-shift in the case of 1 and negligible shift in 2 indicate the twisted structure of the molecules, as can also be seen from the optimized geometry of the representative compound 1, where the two phenyl rings surrounded the BTD moiety are twisted by an angle of 34.8° and 34.0° with respect to the BTD unit (Scheme 1). For a better understanding of the intramolecular CT features of the BTD derivatives, solvatochromic experiments were carried out for compound 2. The absorption (Fig. 2a) and emission (Fig. 2b) spectra were recorded in different solvents (0.08 μM) varying from nonpolar to polar solvents. From the non-polar hexane to polar DMF, a red-shift of 46 nm was observed in the emission peaks (Table S1, ESI†). The red-shifts in the emission peaks indicate the CT behavior of the excited states.24 Furthermore, the quantification of the impact of solvent polarity on the nature of the excited states was carried out using the Lippert–Mataga relationship (Fig. 2c).37 The Lippert–Mataga plot provides information about the change in the dipole moment of the emissive state, S1, by relating the Stokes shift (νa − νf) to the solvent polarity. The plot of Stokes shift versus orientational polarizability showed two slopes having a linear correlation in the low- and high-polarity regimes, indicating the change in the dipole moment of the S1 state. We inferred that the increase in the CT character on increasing the solvent polarity suggests the presence of LE in low-polarity solvents and CT states in higher-polarity solvents. Also, the fluorescence intensity was observed to be the highest in non-polar solvents demonstrating the presence of LE states, while the decline in higher polar solvents is due to the predominant CT character (Fig. S8b, ESI†). The ground state dipole moment was estimated to be 1.81 D with the help of DFT at the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level. Further, the calculated excited state dipole moment was found to be 14.34 D in low-polarity solvents and 18.90 D in high-polarity solvents, also supporting the coexistence of two types of states, i.e. weak CT (i.e. LE) and strong CT states. In the solvents of intermediate polarity, one ‘hybridized state’ is expected, known as the HLCT state, which is favorable for the good emission properties of the fluorophore.

The highly emissive green colored luminescence of BTD derivative 1 was checked for its sensing ability (discussed in detail in the ESI,† Section 4.2) towards various metal cations (Co2+, Zn2+, Al3+, Pb2+, Mn2+, Cd2+, Cu2+, Fe2+, and Ni2+) (Fig. S9 and S10, ESI†) and anions (F−, Cl−, Br−, I−, NO3−, CH3COO−, SO42−, and CO32−) (Fig. S11 and S12, ESI†) by monitoring the change in fluorescence intensity upon their addition to 5 × 10−6 M parent solution (THF:H2O, 90:10 (v/v), H2O: 1 mM tris-buffered saline (TBS), pH = 7.4). Among the various cations and anions tested, only Fe2+ and I− showed fluorescence quenching. Further, compound 1 showed potential application as a staining agent. Pollen grains of Hibiscus rosa-sinensis were treated with compound 1 for 15 min at ambient temperature, which showed green fluorescence in the intracellular area. This suggests that compound 1 is cell-permeable and successfully stained the pollen grains (Fig. S13, ESI†).
Theoretical studies
To further explore the electronic properties of the compounds, geometry optimization in the ground state and frontier molecular orbital calculations were performed via DFT using the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) basis set. As displayed in Fig. S14 (ESI†), for both compounds, the HOMOs of the BTD derivatives are localized on the electron-donor horizontal backbone (composed of three benzene rings) of the molecules. The LUMOs are located on the central electron-deficient BTD moiety and slightly extended to the neighboring benzene rings. This type of orbital feature including spatial separation in conjunction with slight overlap generally results in orbital coupling and charge transfer features in molecules. This adequate bipolar nature is beneficial for enhanced charge transport and high PL efficiency of materials when employed as emitter components in OLED devices.13,26 The DFT analysis revealed that the phenyl rings adjacent to the BTD moiety are at an angle of 34.8° and 34.0° for compound 1 (Scheme 1). This intramolecular twist in the molecular orbitals is favorable for the occurrence of the LE and CT states in the molecules.11–18 Additionally, the twisted molecular geometry in combination with the rigid chromophores overcomes the detrimental π–π stacking interactions in the solid-state, which usually leads to aggregation-caused fluorescence quenching, while simultaneously allowing the adequate π-interaction necessary for better charge hopping when used in devices.26,38
To understand the properties of the excited states, TD-DFT and natural transition orbitals (NTO) in the case of 2 were evaluated (Fig. 3, Tables S2 and S3, ESI†).11–18 The calculated energy levels of the first five singlet and triplet states are plotted in Fig. 3. The small energy gap of 0.15 eV was found between the singlet S1 and triplet T2 states (ΔES1/T2), while the T2 to T1 energy gap (ΔET2/T1) of ca. 1.13 eV was large enough, which will not allow triplet excitons to decay to the T1 state. Therefore the triplet excitons in the T2 state can easily undergo a spin–flip transition to singlet the S1 state. The ‘hole’ of the singlet state is mainly located on the three consecutive benzene rings in a horizontal direction. On the other hand, the particle lies on the electron-deficient 2,1,3 BTD group and slightly on the adjacent phenyl rings. This spatial distribution of hole and particle together with the partial overlap indicates the HLCT nature of the S1 excited state. As a result of the small ΔES1/T2 and large ΔET2/T1 gap together with the HLCT nature of the S1 state, the RISC process is highly favorable via hot exciton channel. Therefore, the use of triplet excitons in addition to singlet excitons in these BTD-based emitters becomes highly favorable by the HLCT phenomenon when used in OLED devices. The electrochemical characterization of the BTD derivatives provided insight into the redox behavior of the electroactive compounds. The oxidation and reduction onsets in the cyclic voltammogram were employed to calculate the HOMO and LUMO energy levels, respectively (Table 1). The calculated HOMO levels for 1/2 are −5.39/−5.38 eV and the LUMO levels are −3.56/−3.44 eV (Fig. S15, ESI†). The low-lying LUMO and high-lying HOMO of the molecules indicate the ambipolar charge transport nature39 of the BTD derivatives.

Electroluminescence behaviour
BTD derivatives 1 and 2 display excellent photophysical behaviour (with well-proportioned HLCT excited state) and electrochemical behavior, which inspired us to investigate the electroluminescent (EL) properties of OLED devices utilizing these compounds for their fabrication. To evaluate the EL characteristics of these BTD-based small molecules, solution-processed doped devices were fabricated. The bipolar host 4,4′-bis(9-carbazolyl)-biphenyl (CBP) was employed to fabricate the devices using compounds 1 and 2 as emitters with the device configurations of ITO/PEDOT:PSS (35 nm)/CBP: x wt% of emitter (dopant) 1 or 2 (x = 1.0, 3.0, and 5.0) (22 nm)/TPBi (40 nm)/LiF (1.5 nm)/Al (150 nm), as displayed in Fig. 4a. The triplet energy (ET) of the CBP host (2.60 eV) is greater than the triplet energy of emitter molecules 1 and 2 (vide infra), ensuring the exciton confinement in the emitter layer, and hence expected higher device efficiency.40 The presence of long side-chains in compounds 1 and 2 renders its excellent solubility in organic solvents and allowed the devices to be solution-processable together with their good miscibility within the CBP host matrix to form a homogeneous emissive layer.41 The topography images of the CBP:1 and CBP:2 films (at 1 wt% dopant concentration) measured by AFM (atomic force microscopy) in tapping mode are well homogeneous, as shown for compound 2 in Fig. S16 (ESI†). The root mean square (RMS) roughness of the pure CBP:1 and CBP:2 films was recorded to be 9.5 nm (Rq = 0.35 nm and Ra = 0.26 nm) and 10.1 nm (Rq = 0.38 nm and Ra = 0.29 nm), respectively, indicating the good miscibility between the compounds and the CBP host. The devices were fabricated by employing emitters 1 and 2 doped at three different concentrations of 1, 3 and 5 wt% in the CBP host matrix. The doping concentration of the emitter materials had a strong influence on the EL behaviour of the devices. For example, on decreasing the doping concentration from 5 wt% to 3 wt% to 1 wt%, the EQE increased subsequently from 1.7% to 4.7% to 7.0% in the case of 1 and from 2.1% to 5.1% to 8.1% for emitter 2 (Table S4, ESI†). The increase in EQE on decreasing the doping concentration can be attributed to the dilution effect originating from the uniform dispersion of dopant with the CBP host, as confirmed by AFM (Fig. S16, ESI†), resulting in the suppression of aggregates, which minimized the concentration-quenching of the fluorophores in the solid-state.41 The current density, luminance vs. voltage, current efficiency (CE), power efficiency (PE) vs. luminance curves, and EL characteristics of the best devices (1 wt%) for 1 and 2 are displayed in Fig. 4b–d, Table 2, and with the 3 wt% and 5 wt% doped devices are shown in Fig. S17, Table S4, ESI.† For the best devices, both emitters exhibited green luminescence, as observed from the EL spectra, which displayed a peak at 532 nm for 1 and 528 nm for 2 (Fig. 4c). It can be noted that for both compounds, the EL spectra of the doped devices (Fig. S18, ESI†) became narrow and blue-shifted (31 nm for 1 and 18 nm for 2) in comparison to their PL spectra, which indicates the suppression of aggregates upon doping with the CBP host. This type of blue shift and narrowing of the peaks has been reported earlier when emitter materials were doped with the CBP host.42 However, the emission lies in the green region, indicating that the electroluminescence originated from the emissive layers with no excimer or exciplex emission. For compound 2, the device exhibited a better performance, with a maximum current efficiency of 24.9 cd A−1, power efficiency of 15.6 lm W−1 and EQE of 8.1% with the maximum brightness of 2476 cd m−2. Furthermore, this device displayed a better power efficiency, PEmax. ∼ PE100 (24.3%), and current efficiency, CEmax. ∼ CE100 (23.3%), roll-off than the compound 1-based devices (Table S5, ESI†). Fig. S20 (ESI†) illustrates the EQE versus voltage plots of the devices, displaying an efficiency roll-off profile. It is noteworthy that the triplet energy (Fig. S19, ESI†) of compound 2 (2.44 eV) is sufficiently higher than that of compound 1 (2.31 eV) and well consistent with that of the CBP (2.60 eV) host, which enables favorable host–guest energy transfer, hence demonstrating a better charge balance and exciton confinement state in the emissive layer of the compound 2-based devices.40 Compound 1 performed comparably less well, exhibiting a maximum current efficiency of 23.1 cd A−1, power efficiency of 14.5 lm W−1 and EQE of 7.0% with a brightness of 1910 cd m−2. The devices exhibited higher EQE values (Table 2) than the traditional limit by surpassing their EUE beyond 25%, suggesting the use of both singlet and triplet excitons. The EUE of the devices were calculated using the following equation:13,18ηEQE = ηrec·ηS·ηPL·ηoutwhere ηEQE is the EQE of the OLED device, ηS represents the EUE, ηPL is the PL quantum yield, ηrec denotes the proportion of electron–hole recombination, which is usually assumed to be unity in an ideal case, and ηout is the light out-coupling efficiency, which is ∼20% for ITO-based flat thin-film OLEDs.13 Once ηEQE and ηPL are known, ηS can be calculated. The ηPL of the neat films was measured to be 81% and 85% for compounds 1 and 2, respectively. The corresponding ηs in the resultant OLED devices was estimated (using above equation) to be ∼43% and ∼48%, assuming the full electron–hole recombination i.e. ηrec is considered to be unity, respectively. Remarkably, EUE sufficiently surpasses the spin-statistics limit of the radiative exciton ratio of 25% for conventional fluorescent OLEDs. This indicates the utilization of triplet excitons by the spin–flip mechanism occurs by one of the various possible mechanistic pathways, viz. HLCT, TADF and TTA. As probed in the above sections, the Lippert–Mataga plots and nature of excited states for the representative compound 2 revealed the HLCT nature of the excited states, thereby the conversion of triplet excitons to singlet excitons takes place via the RISC phenomenon using ‘hot exciton’ channels. The mono-exponential PL decay of compound 2 also supports the presence of a hybridized state (Fig. S21, ESI†). Moreover, the existence of a shorter lifetime and the absence of any delayed component in the PL decay exclude the possibility of the TADF mechanism.

Conclusions
In summary, we explored the application of two luminescent benzothiadiazole derivatives (1 and 2) as efficient emitter materials in solution-processable OLED devices. The emitter materials exhibited green electroluminescence in the fabricated devices and surpassed the traditional EQE limit of fluorescent OLEDs. The obtained maximum EQE value of 7.0% for compound 1 and 8.1% for compound 2 surpassing the traditional limit was explained with the aid of systematic photophysical studies and quantum chemical calculations. The conclusive studies revealed the occurrence of the HLCT phenomenon, where the triplet excitons from the T2 triplet state to the S1 singlet state take place through the RISC process via ‘hot-exciton’ channels. On the other hand, compound 1 showed the sensitive and selective sensing towards Fe(II) ions among various cations and the I− anion among several anions with a detection limit as low as 41 ppb and 32 ppb, respectively. It was also successfully applied in bio-imaging using pollen grains, which can find potential applications in diagnostics. Therefore, we believe that the present findings offer important guidelines for multifunctional molecular design and provide an important step forward to expand the applications of small π-conjugated luminescent molecules.
