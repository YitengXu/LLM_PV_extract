    , Accepted 19th September 2008First published on 5th November 2008AbstractA new Ru(L)(dcbpy)(NCS)2 dye containing a pyrrole-based π-extended ligand has been prepared and showed very good light harvesting ability with near 70% IPCE in the visible region. The performance is very close to those of the standard N3 with a wider absorption range.
Introduction
The past decade has seen much attention paid to dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs).1–10 Indeed these efficient sunlight-to-electricity converters are low cost alternatives to silicon-based semiconductors. The principle of these devices is to harvest photons from sunlight using a dye, usually a ruthenium-based complex, chemisorbed via electron-withdrawing linkage on nanoporous TiO2electrodes.. The absorbed photons then provoke excitation of the metal complex and subsequent electron injection into the TiO2 conduction band. An electron transport mediator, usually an electrolyte based on the I−/I3− couple, is used to regenerate the dye allowing charge transport across the liquid phase.
The sensitizing dye thus plays a central role in the conversion process and efforts have been made to improve them by modifying the ligands around the central metal. The latest developments are mainly related to RuL(dcbpy)(NCS)2 dyes (L = bipyridine, dcbpy = 4,4′-dicarboxy-2,2′-bipyridine). This family of complexes was reported to absorb light within a wide domain with high molar extinction coefficients,11–14 the most popular being N3 (Ru(dcbpy)2(NCS)2.15–17 Several efforts have been made to still improve the light harvesting and stability of these dyes. Main works have focused on the replacement of one of the dcbpy ligands by a bipyridine bearing substituents with specific electronic properties such as electron-donor effects and charge delocalization to increase molar extinction coefficients and prevent injected electron recombination by spatial charge separation.14,18–21
In this context, N-pyrrolo-bipyridine ligands (L) are promising and we have reported their effect on the light harvesting ability of [RuL3]2+ and [RuL2(dcbpy)]2+ complexes.22,23 Moreover, we have shown that the pyrrole moiety could be co-polymerized with EDOP (3,4-ethylenedioxy-pyrrole) molecules giving access to new solid-state solar cells, the hole transporter being the polymer (PEDOP).24 In our continuing efforts to optimize the dye performance, we have focused on complexes [Ru(L1)3]2+ and Ru(L1)(dcbpy)(NCS)2 bearing an extended pyrrole-based ligand L1 (Fig. 1). Herein, we report the synthesis of the complexes as well as a comparison of their spectroscopic and electrochemical properties with those of complexes [Ru(L2)3]2+ and Ru(L2)(dcbpy)(NCS)2 characterized by the absence of the styryl group, in order to evaluate the effect of charge delocalization.

Results and discussion

L2 was obtained in 70% yield following our previous works by regioselective lithiation–chlorination of 4-pyrrolopyridine, and Ni-catalyzed homocoupling (Scheme 1).25 This methodology was not suitable for preparation of L1 since we knew from separate experiments that the styryl group was sensitive to nucleophilic additions by BuLi.26 Thus, we turned to the direct functionalization of 4,4′-dimethylbipyridine using a Knoevenagel reaction with the appropriate 4-pyrrolo-benzaldehyde.27 In the presence of t-BuOK in DMF at 100 °C, L1 was obtained in an acceptable 60% yield (Scheme 2).
 Scheme 1  Synthesis of ligand L2. Reagents and conditions: (i) BuLi-Me2N(CH2)2OLi (2 eq.), toluene, −78 °C, 1 h; (ii) C2Cl6 (2.5 eq.), toluene, −78 °C to r.t.; (iii) NiCl2 (1.1 eq.), PPh3 (4.4 eq.), Zn (1.1 eq.), degassed DMF, 50 °C, 1.5 h. 
 Scheme 2  Synthesis of ligand L1. Reagents and conditions: (i) 4-pyrrolo-benzaldehyde (2.2 eq.), t-BuOK (4 eq.), DMF, 100 °C, overnight. 
With ligands in hand, we investigated the preparation of symmetrically coordinated complexes [Ru(L1)3]2+ and [Ru(L2)3]2+ needed for evaluation of ligand effect on the complex properties in the absence of electronic perturbations induced by the presence of different types of ligands. The preparation of [Ru(L2)3]2+ was already reported by us.22 We had found that when ligand L2 (3 eq.) was classically reacted overnight with RuCl3(H2O)x in refluxing DMF, incomplete incorporation of ligands was obtained leading only to complex mixtures. A very practical and fast complexation under microwave irradiation was found to give [Ru(L2)3]2+ in good yield (85%) after 5 min at 200 °C in ethylene glycol. Our procedure was applied with success to the synthesis of the new complex [Ru(L1)3]2+ obtained as a red solid in 60% yield from L1 (Scheme 3).
 Scheme 3  Preparation of homoleptic complexes. Reagents and conditions: RuCl3(H2O)x (0.33 eq.), N-ethylmorpholine (2 drops), ethylene glycol, microwave irradiation, 250 W, 200 °C, 5 min. 
 Scheme 4  Preparation of heteroleptic complexes. Reagents and conditions: all steps performed under microwave irradiation (250 W); (i) L1 or L2 (1 eq.) DMF, 70 °C, 10 min; (ii) dcbpy (1 eq.), DMF, 150 °C, 10 min; (iii) NH4NCS (10 eq.), DMF, 150 °C, 10 min. 
The heteroleptic complexes Ru(L1)(dcbpy)(NCS)2 and Ru(L2)(dcbpy)(NCS)2 were finally prepared using a one-pot synthesis from the dinuclear [Ru(p-cymene)Cl2]2 complex.8 The ligands were successively coordinated to ruthenium by first introducing L1 or L2 then 4,4′-dicarboxy-2,2′-bipyridine (dcbpy) and finally NCS anions (Scheme 4).
It is worthy to note that each step could be performed under microwave irradiation, thus avoiding long periods of heating and possible degradation of the ligands. The target complexes were obtained in acceptable to good yields after size exclusion separation on a Sephadex LH20 column.
The absorption spectra of the ligands were measured in acetonitrile (Fig. 2). Both ligands absorbed in the 220–320 nm region. In this domain, the extinction coefficient was much higher for L2 (124 × 103 M−1 cm−1) instead of 36.1 × 103 M−1 cm−1 for L1. The effect of delocalization in L1 was clearly evidenced by band broadening and a red shift of the π–π* transition (λmax = 330 nm, ε = 44.4 × 103 M−1 cm−1).

The absorption spectra of homoleptic complexes reported in Fig. 3 clearly showed the influence of the π-conjugation. Indeed, all the absorption maxima were slightly red shifted and molar extinction coefficients were considerably increased from [Ru(L2)3]2+ to [Ru(L1)3]2+ due to the higher transition dipole moment. The latter complex exhibited two absorptions bands: the first at 374 nm with a very high ε value (115 × 103 M−1 cm−1), the second at 490 nm (ε = 52 × 103 M−1 cm−1) due to the MLCT transition. For comparison, the absorption maximum of [Ru(L2)3]2+ was observed at 480 nm with a much lower molar extinction coefficient (22 × 103 M−1 cm−1).
 Fig. 3  
UV-vis absorption spectra of homoleptic complexes in acetonitrile. 
The red shift was also observed in emission spectra with λ = 650 and 689 nm for [Ru(L2)3]2+ and [Ru(L1)3]2+, respectively.
The cyclic voltammetry of both the complexes showed two oxidation waves, in addition to the reversible RuII/RuIII wave, pyrrole was found to be oxidized irreversibly at 1.2 V/SCE.
The extended ligand L1 had also a marked effect on the oxidation potential of the RuIII/RuII couple, which was notably raised in [Ru(L1)3]2+ (1.30 vs. 1.12 V/SCE for [Ru(L2)3]2+). The reason was probably due to a weakening of the donor effect of pyrrole through the styryl group in L1 in contrast with L2 where the pyrrole was directly bonded to bipyridine. Thus, it was clear that ligand L1 notably modified the electronic properties of the complex by increasing the molar extinction coefficient and light harvesting ability, promising features for dye application.
The absorption spectra of the heteroleptic complexes (Fig. 4) Ru(L1)(dcbpy)(NCS)2 and Ru(L2)(dcbpy)(NCS)2 showed a strong analogy with those of N3 (Table 1) and of other [Ru(L)(L′)(NCS)2] (where L is a bypiridine type ligand) complexes, which have been deeply investigated. In the high energy region near 300 nm, sharp and intense bipyridine centered π–π* transitions were found. At lower energy (350–550 nm) two main broad MLCT transitions were observed, corresponding to the transfer from filled dπ metal orbitals to empty π* orbitals mainly localized on the bipyridine ligands.
 Fig. 4  
UV-vis absorption spectra of heteroleptic complexes. 
The effect of L1 in Ru(L1)(dcbpy)(NCS)2 was clearly shown by intense bands at 357 nm (ε = 33.2 × 103 M−1 cm−1) and 540 nm (ε = 10.3 × 103 M−1 cm−1). In the same region, the molar extinction coefficients of Ru(L2)(dcbpy)(NCS)2 were much lower (10.2 × 103 and 8.7 × 103 M−1 cm−1 at 379 and 534 nm, respectively).
The lowest energy absorption tail up to 700 nm arose from transitions from non-bonding NCS orbitals28 to π* bipyridine orbitals. The complexes were found to be emitting in fluid solution at room temperature in the 800–830 nm interval with an excited state (3MLCT) lifetime near 30 ns (Table 1). Upon deprotonation of the carboxylic moieties, a blue shift of the emission maxima of about 20–50 nm, consistent with the destabilization of the dcbpy anti-bonding orbitals, was observed. The observed increase in emission intensity due to the augmented ground-excited state energy gap followed as a consequence. As already observed in homoleptic complexes, the irreversible oxidation wave of pyrrole was clearly seen at 1.2 V/SCE. L1 was found to induce an increase of the oxidation potential of the RuIII/RuII couple compared to L2. This should make the regeneration by the mediator after metal oxidation in the DSC easier.
In addition, the calculation of the excited-state oxidation potential for sensitizers Ru(L1)(dcbpy)(NCS)2 and Ru(L2)(dcbpy)(NCS)2 (E*1/2ox (RuIII/RuII*)) (Table 1) indicated that their excited states exhibit far sufficient reducing abilities to allow the electron injection into the conduction band of TiO2, which is estimated to lie at near −0.7 V/SCE.30
The dyes were then chemisorbed onto TiO2 films and the sensitization was controlled by UV-vis spectroscopy (Fig. 5). As shown, Ru(L1)(dcbpy)(NCS)2 and Ru(L2)(dcbpy)(NCS)2 displayed a wide absorption range comparable to those of N3. The absorbances were optimal at 550 nm and decreased slowly until 700 nm. The dye Ru(L1)(dcbpy)(NCS)2 bearing L1 exhibited the best absorbance attributable to charge delocalization through the pyrrole styryl and bipyridine.
 Fig. 5  Overlay absorption spectra of TiO2 photoanodes modified with the new heteroleptic complexes and N3. 
From these promising results, four DSCs were assembled using the new dyes and two different mediators such as the common I−/I3− and the recently reported [Co(DTB)3]2+ (DTB = 4,4′-diterbutyl-bipyridine).31,32 IPCE measurements were performed and are reported in Fig. 6 and 7
 Fig. 6  Photoaction spectra with mediator LiI 0.5 M and I2 0.05 M in acetonitrile. LiClO4 (0.5 M) was present in every electrolyte solution. 
The effect of π-conjugation was very marked using I3−/I− as the mediator since the best performance was obtained with Ru(L1)(dcbpy)(NCS)2 attaining a good IPCE value (near 70%) within the maximum absorption range (Fig. 6). The results were promising, since a maximum IPCE comparable with the standard N3 could be attained, with the advantage of an increased spectral sensitivity: notably an IPCE of still 25% was observed at 700 nm. Ru(L2)(dcbpy)(NCS)2 furnished a much lower photocurrent (30% IPCE) possibly indicating a less efficient regeneration by the mediator.
With [Co(DTB)3]2+ as mediator (Fig. 7), the IPCE were generally lower and a reverse order was observed. Ru(L2)(dcbpy)(NCS)2 gave a better IPCE (55%) than did Ru(L1)(dcbpy)(NCS)2 (45%). In any case, the dyes showed a wider absorption domain than the standard N3.
 Fig. 7  Photoaction spectra with mediator [Co(DTB)3]2+/[Co(DTB)3]3+ 0.15/0.015 M in acetonitrile. LiClO4 (0.5 M) was present in every electrolyte solution. 
The mediator effect on the IPCE could be partly explained by comparing the oxidation potentials of the RuIII/RuII couple in the dyes and those of the mediators couples. The oxidation of the RuIII/RuII couple for Ru(L1)(dcbpy)(NCS)2 was 0.80 V/SCE and those of Ru(L2)(dcbpy)(NCS)2 was 0.61 V/SCE. Thus, the I−/I3− mediator (0.40 V/SCE) regenerated much better Ru(L1)(dcbpy)(NCS)2 giving the best IPCE.
Transient absorption spectroscopy experiments have been performed to improve our understanding of the interaction between the dye and the electron mediators (Fig. 8).
 Fig. 8  Transient absorption spectra of dye-sensitized TiO2 with Ru(L1)(dcbpy)(NCS)2 (A) and Ru(L2)(dcbpy)(NCS)2 (B) in the presence of various mediators LiOTf (0.5 M), I− (0.15M), Co(DTB)2+ (0.15M) in acetonitrile (λexc = 532 nm, λobs = 500 nm; power intensity = 14 mJ per pulse). 
From these experiments, it was evident that the Ru(L1)(dcbpy)(NCS)2 dye was regenerated very efficiently, within a few nanoseconds, by both iodide and cobalt mediators, with iodide being slightly faster. The Ru(L2)(dcbpy)(NCS)2 dye exhibited a very similar behaviour, although the dye recovery was slower than in the Ru(L1)(dcbpy)(NCS)2 case, due to a smaller driving force for the intermolecular electron transfer. In general, iodide displayed better reduction capabilities in both cases, despite a smaller driving force for the electron transfer reaction, due to its moderate re-organizational energy compared to the cobalt(II) complex. Thus, it was difficult to explain the different performances of the dyes in the presence of the two electron mediators only on the basis of dye regeneration, particularly in the case of Ru(L2)(dcbpy)(NCS)2, which exhibited substantially better performances (on basis of IPCE) when associated to the cobalt couple.
Therefore, we have studied the recombination kinetics in the presence of identical concentrations of the oxidized mediators I3− and Co(DTB)33+, respectively.33 In this case, to avoid interference from I3− absorption and photochemistry,34 we have monitored the decay of the dye–cation absorption at 750 nm. It must be recalled that in the absence of electron donating electrolytes, the only pathway of dye–cation recovery is recombination with photoinjected electrons. If these were captured by the oxidized mediators, the lifetime of the dye–cation would be substantially lengthened, since a fraction of electrons would not be available for direct recombination; in general, the higher the increase in the dye–cation lifetime, the more efficient the electron recapture is by the oxidized mediator (Fig. 9).
 Fig. 9  Recombination kinetics of photoinjected electrons in dye-sensitized TiO2 with Ru(L1)(dcbpy)(NCS)2 (A) and Ru(L2)(dcbpy)(NCS)2 (B) in the presence of LiOTf (0.5 M) and oxidized mediators I3− (0.1M) and Co(DTB)33+ (0.1M) in acetonitrile (λexc = 532 nm, λobs = 500 nm; power intensity = 14 mJ per pulse). 
From Fig. 9A, it was clear that the dye–cation recovery in Ru(L1)(dcbpy)(NCS)2 was faster in the presence of I3− than in the presence of [Co(DTB)3]3+ meaning that the latter intercepted the photoinjected electrons more efficiently. The situation was reversed for Ru(L2)(dcbpy)(NCS)2 where the dye recovery, in the presence of I3−, was significantly slower than in the presence of [Co(DTB)3]3+, meaning that in these conditions I3− was the best electron acceptor.
Thus, on the basis of the transient kinetics performed, the behaviour of each dye in the presence of the two different mediators could be rationalized. Ru(L1)(dcbpy)(NCS)2 showed the best performances in association to the iodide–triodide mediator since it allowed for the fastest regeneration and the slowest electron recombination, while Ru(L2)(dcbpy)(NCS)2 was better with [Co(DTB)3]2+/[Co(DTB)3]3+, essentially because of a less efficient electron recapture by [Co(DTB)3]3+ with respect to triiodide.
The sterically hindering styryl-pyrrolo groups in Ru(L1)(dcbpy)(NCS)2 may be capable of forming a barrier even against access of small ions, like I3− to the TiO2 surface, therefore reducing electron recapture with respect to [Co(DTB)3]3+. The same protective effect was absent in the Ru(L2)(dcbpy)(NCS)2 in which the pyrrole groups could passivate the surface against the bulky cobalt complex, but were unable to prevent, with the same effectiveness, the back recombination with the smaller triiodide.
Conclusions
In summary, we have prepared new pyrrole-based, valuable ruthenium dyes for solar cells. Ru(L1)(dcbpy)(NCS)2 bearing the pyrrole-based π-extended ligand L1 showed a very good light harvesting ability with near 70% IPCE in the visible region. The π-conjugation in L1 contributed to a dramatic improvement compared to complex Ru(L2)(dcbpy)(NCS)2 bearing ligand L2 with pyrrole directly bound to bipyridine when used in the presence of the I−/I3− mediator. This difference could be explained by an efficient driving force for the intermolecular electron transfer and a better protective effect of the hindering styryl-pyrrolo groups against photoinjected electrons recapture by the mediator.
The new Ru(L1)(dcbpy)(NCS)2 performance is very close to those of the standard N3 with a wider absorption range. Another advantage is the availability of the pyrrole group for further polymerizations and access to solid-state devices.
Experimental
General

Materials. 

            4-Pyrrolobenzadehyde,27L225 and [Ru(L2)3]2+22 were prepared according to published procedures. Other chemical reagents were commercially available and used as such. DMF was degassed by several vacuum–argon cycles before use.


Analyses and measurements. 

1H and 13C NMR were recorded on AC200, AC250 or DRX400 Bruker spectrometers. Microwave experiments were performed on a CEM Discover device fitted with an infrared probe temperature control. Absorption UV-vis electronic spectra were recorded on a Varian Cary E spectrometer and emission UV-vis electronic spectra on a SLM Aminco Bowman Series 2 apparatus using a (1 × 1 cm) quartz cell in deoxygenated solutions (OD < 0.05). Excited state lifetimes were measured by time correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) using a Picoquant apparatus. 460 nm excitation of optically diluted (A460≈ 0.2) dye solutions in CH3CN were obtained with a PLS-8–2–271 nanoled (FWHM = 500 ps, repetition rate = 5 MHz) driven by a PDL 800-B variable frequency pulsing unit. The same unit also provided the electric synchronization signal necessary to the Picoharp 300 TAC/ADC module for the photon arrival time measurement. Sample luminescence was filtered by a 610 nm cut-off filter and single photon emission events were detected by an Hamamatsu PMT-PMA-185-P phototube, pre-amplified and fed to the TAC/ADC unit. Emission decay histograms were automatically acquired on a PC and deconvoluted from the source profile using the Picoquant Fluofit® dedicated software. GC-MS (EI) spectra were obtained on a HP 5971 analyzer. Electrospray mass spectra were recorded on an Agilent MSD using CH3CN as solvent. The electrochemical measurements were performed with a Voltalab PST006 Radiometer potentiostat using a conventional single compartment three-electrode cell. The reference electrode was the potassium chloride calomel electrode (SCE), the working electrode was a 10 mm Pt wire and the counter-electrode was a 1 cm2 vitreous carbon disc. The supported electrolyte was Bu4N+BF4−0.1M in CH3CN and the solutions were purged with argon before each measurement. A 0.5 mM solution of the studied compound was generally used. All potentials are quoted vs.SCE and under these conditions, the redox potential of Fc+/Fc was found at 0.38 V. In all the experiments, the scan rate was 100 mV s−1. IPCE measurements were performed by illumination of the cell using an Osram 150 W xenon lamp coupled to an Applied Photophysics monochromator. The irradiated surface was 0.5 cm2. Photocurrents were measured under short circuit conditions by a digital Agilent 34410A multimeter. Incident irradiance was measured with a 1 cm2 Centronic OSD100–7Q calibrated silicon photodiode.
Transient spectroscopy experiments were carried out by using a previously described transient absorption apparatus.32 The 532 nm laser radiation was defocused with a plano-concave lens to obtain pulse energies of the order of 14 mJ cm−2. No sample degradation was observed over several laser shots. To obtain a satisfactory S–N ratio, oscillographic traces were averaged over 10 laser shots. The sample consisted of a sensitized TiO2 film in contact with an appropriate electrolytic solution in acetonitrile.

          . 

            4-Pyrrolobenzaldehyde (257 mg, 1.5 mmol) and 4,4′-dimethyl-2,2′-bipyridine (92 mg, 0.5 mmol) were dissolved in 10 mL of deoxygenated anhydrous DMF. Solid potassium tert-butoxyde (224 mg, 2.0 mmol) was then added rapidly. Immediately a yellow solid formed, which became darker. 3 drops of water were then added and the yellow suspension was stirred at 100 °C overnight. The solid was filtered, washed with methanol and dissolved in boiling acetic acid (400–500 mL) giving a dark orange solution. After cooling, the liquid was concentrated and the solution was left for several hours to precipitate. The bright yellow solid was filtered and washed with methanol. The solid was then suspended in methanolic KOH (approximately 1 M) and stirred for 48 h at room temperature.

Synthesi s of complexes

[Ru(L1)3]2+. 
Ligand L1 (94.2 mg, 0.19 mmol), RuCl3·3H2O (15.7 mg, 0.06 mmol) and two drops of N-ethylmorpholine were suspended in 5 ml of ethyleneglycol. The mixture was irradiated in the microwave oven (5 minutes, 250 W, 200 °C). Once cold, the dark red solution was poured into 25 ml of saturated aqueous solution of KPF6 and left into the fridge for several hours. The red solid formed was filtered and washed with water, toluene and diethyl ether. The obtained solid was dissolved in the minimum amount of acetonitrile, poured into 25 ml of water and left precipitating into the fridge. After filtration and washing (water, toluene, diethyl ether) the product was obtained as a dark red solid (65 mg,60%).1H NMR- (400 MHz, CD3CN) δ/ppm: 8.79 (s, 6H); 7.82 (d, J = 16.0 Hz, 6H,); 7.80 (d, J = 6.8 Hz, 12H); 7.62 (d, J = 8.8 Hz, 12H); 7.54 (d, J = 5.2 Hz, 6H); 7.35 (d, J = 16.4 Hz, 6H); 7.29 (s, 18H); 6.37 (s, 12H). MS (ESI): 1718.5 [M–PF6]+; 786.3 [M-2PF6]2+. UV-vis (CH3CN), λmax/nm (ε/M−1cm−1) = 490 (52000) and 374 (115000).


General procedure for preparation of heteroleptic complexes. 

L1 or L2 (0.06 mmol) and the ruthenium p-cymene dimer (18.4 mg, 0.03 mmol) were suspended in 5 mL of N,N-dimethylformamide. The mixture was irradiated in the microwave oven (10 min, 250 W, 70 °C), resulting in a clear yellow solution. Once cold, the solid dcbpy ligand (14.7 mg, 0.06 mmol) was added and the mixture irradiated again (10 min, 250 W, 160 °C). Once cold, NH4NCS (45.7 mg, 0.6 mmol) was finally added to the dark green solution and irradiation was repeated (10 min, 250 W, 160 °C). Once cold, most of the solvent was evaporated and the flask filled with water and left in the fridge for several hours. The dark purple solid that formed was filtered and washed with water. To purify the product, it was dissolved in a small amount of methanol (adding some drops of methanolic NBu4OH solution to help solubility) and subjected to a Sephadex LH-20 column with methanol, the more coloured bands were collected together and mixed with 5 mL of water. The methanol was carefully evaporated and the aqueous solution treated with diluted HNO3 until pH 3 was reached. Immediate precipitation was observed. The solid was filtered and washed with water and Et2O.

            [Co(dtbbpy)3]2+. 

            [Co(dtbbpy)3]2+ was prepared according to a published procedure.31[Co(dtbbpy)3]3+ was obtained by addition of a slight excess of NOBF4 to an acetonitrile solution of Co(DTB)32+. The solution was allowed to stir at room temperature for a couple of hours and evaporated (60 °C) to dryness, affording a yellow-orange solid. Unreacted NOBF4 quickly decomposed upon heating during evaporation.

TiO2electrode preparation
A TiO2 colloidal paste was prepared by hydrolysis of Ti(IV) isopropoxide. The nanocrystalline TiO2 photoelectrodes were prepared by depositing the paste onto transparent conducting FTO glass (either Delta Technologies or IBE, 7 Ω/Square) according to the well known “scotch tape” method. The thin films were allowed to dry at room temperature for 20 min and finally fired at 450 °C for 40 min. The still hot electrodes were then immersed in the dye solution and kept at 80 °C for 5 h, after which the absorption was deemed complete. The efficiency of absorption was evaluated by UV-vis spectroscopy: photoelectrodes characterized by an optical density ≥ 1 at the MLCT maximum of the sensitizer were commonly obtained. Dye solutions were prepared by dissolving a small amount of the Ru(II) complex in acetonitrile (ca. 4 mg in 10 mL of solvent). The solutions were sonicated and filtered to remove suspended undissolved dye.

          Counter electrodes preparation

          Platinum coated counter electrodes were obtained by spraying a 5 × 10−3 M H2PtCl6 (Fluka) solution in isopropanol on the well-cleaned surface of an FTO glass. This procedure was repeated 5–10 times to obtain an homogeneous distribution of H2PtCl6 droplets. The electrodes were dried under a gentle air flow and treated in an oven at 380 °C for 15 min obtaining the formation of stable platinum clusters. Gold coated electrodes, used with cobalt-based mediators were obtained by thermal vapour deposition on FTO of a 5–7 nm thick chromium adhesion layer followed by a 30–35 nm thick gold layer. The average pressure of the vacuum chamber of the evaporator was about 9 × 10−6 torr.
Photoelectrochemical cell assembly.28,31
Parafilm® sealed cells were built by pressing the sensitized photoanode against a counter electrode equipped with a parafilm® frame used to confine the liquid electrolyte inside the cell. The thickness of liquid layer corresponded roughly to the thickness of the frame borders (≅120 μm). In this configuration, the cell was stable towards solvent evaporation and leaking for several days even using volatile solvents like acetonitrile. In both cases, metallic clamps were used to hold the two electrodes firmly together. The cobalt-based mediators were prepared according to published procedures.31

Comparisons between recombination rates in the presence of oxidized mediators between different dyes should not be carried out essentially due to different dye loading, exposed TiO2 surface and different lithium content, all factors that can variably affect and alter the recombination rate. The only safe comparisons can be drawn relatively to the recombination rate of a single type of dye in the presence of different electron mediators.
A transient positive absorption, with a lifetime of hundreds of nanoseconds, could be observed at 500 nm upon 532 nm laser excitation of an I3− solution in acetonitrile.
