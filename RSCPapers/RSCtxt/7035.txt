    , Accepted 14th May 2008First published on 19th June 2008AbstractWe have developed a simple but robust process, plasma enhanced polymer Transfer printing (PEPTP), for fabricating micropatterns of semi-conducting poly(3-hexyl thiophene) (P3HT) thin films. The method is based on transferring thin P3HT film spin cast directly on a pre-patterned elastomeric poly(dimethyl siloxane) (PDMS) mold. Printing is accomplished by the application of oxygen plasma on both P3HT film and substrate for surface energy modulation at ambient conditions without additional pressure. The control of the relative interfacial surface energy by the plasma enables us to micro/nanopattern a wide range of polymers from P3HT to conventional insulating ones on various substrates including Si, glass and polymers over large areas. A bottom contact organic thin film transistor with the printed P3HT patterns using PEPTP exhibits a carrier mobility of approximately 0.02 cm2V−1 s−1 with a relatively high on/off current ratio of 6 × 103.
Introduction
The recent development of high performance organic electronic devices based on semiconducting poly(3-hexyl thiophene) (P3HT) including solar cells, organic thin film transistors (OTFTs) is remarkable.1–3 In particular organic transistors with P3HT as an active layer have great benefits due to its solution process and thus large area fabrication capability in spite of the current demands of material properties such as thermal oxidation, chemical degradation, intrinsic low carrier mobility and so on.4 One of the most important requirements for realization of P3HT OTFTs is how to fabricate effectively microarrays of the individual devices without harming the original properties of P3HT, which becomes, in turn, very necessary to find a way for micropatterning P3HT with thin and uniform thickness, and low chemical damage over a large area.5
Although photolithography with subsequent dry and wet etching processes, available in the current semiconducting industry, is most common and powerful for micropattern fabrication, it is in general hardly applicable to P3HT patterning because the polymer is significantly damaged or alters its intrinsic properties under the harsh patterning conditions, which suggests that a new non-destructive patterning technique should be applied. Among various non-destructive patterning methods including photolithography with protective capping layers,6,7 ink-jet printing8–10 and direct laser writing,11microcontact printing,12–16micromolding in capillaries,17–19 microimprinting,20 and so on, only a few are applicable for fabrication of micropatterns of thin and uniformpolymer films like P3HT patterns for OTFTs without complicated additional processes such as etching and lift-off. For example, capillary molding with dilute polymer solution frequently produces edge thickening arising from a meniscus at the interface between the PDMS mold wall and the polymer solution.17 Similar edge thickening frequently occurs in ink-jet printing. In addition, microimprinting, rarely applicable to thin films less than approximately 100 nm thick for OTFT application, usually gives rise to residual polymer in the pressed regions, which requires an extra etching process.20 Recently Hammond et al.16 have fabricated micron scale patterns of poly(ethylene oxide) using a method called polymer on polymer stamping (POPS) where a polymer solution was used as an ink of microcontact printing for almost mono-layered polymer patterns on which a pattern of bioactive materials was formed. The method, however, is not beneficial for patterning semiconducting active polymer films that are usually 50 nm in thickness with high uniformity for carrier transport.
Semiconducting polymers including P3HT have been frequently micropatterned by solid state transfer methods such as laser thermal imaging2,11 and detachment.21,22 Localized heating induced by a programmed laser source successfully removed part of a spin cast P3HT, resulting in a fine microstructure of the film in laser thermal imaging.2 In the case of detachment, instead of laser a patterned PDMS mold was in conformal contact on a P3HT film and the subsequent application of heat and pressure detached selectively the film contacted with the mold when the mold was removed, leading to the transfer of the P3HT film to the mold.21 Considering that P3HT active layers are often formed on polymeric gate dielectrics such as polyimide and polystyrene3,23,24 to control both interfacial energy and orientation of the crystalline P3HT lamellae, the methods mentioned above are, however, not effective due to possible damage of the polymer dielectrics in the bottom gate device structure by direct contact of the organic solvent in P3HT solution during spin coating.
Thin and uniform metal or semiconductors were directly deposited on a patterned PDMS mold using thermal evaporation and physically transferred to a substrate by application of heat and pressure for a certain period of time.25,26 The pattern transfer occurs in principle when work of adhesion between the deposited material and the substrate becomes larger than that between the material and the PDMS mold. A similar study based on this principle has been reported in which a patterned electroluminescent thin film was prepared by the conformal contact and subsequent detachment of a patterned PDMS mold on a homogeneous thin film of 4,4′-bis[N-1-naphthyl-N-phenylamino]biphenyl (NPB) thermally deposited on indium–tin oxide (ITO) coated glass.22 We envision in this work that the simple pattern transfer of various low molecular materials can be utilized for polymeric materials in particular P3HT combined with spin coating, one of the most desirable methods not only for large area uniform polymer film formation but also from the industrial viewpoint.
We here present a new and effective method, plasma enhanced polymer transfer printing (PEPTP), for fabricating micropatterns of P3HT with thickness of approximately 50 nm over a large area. The method directly transfers a thin P3HT film spin cast on a patterned PDMS mold on a substrate, resulting in a micropattern. For pattern transfer to a variety of substrates including Si, glass and polymers, we introduce oxygen plasma that modulates the relative surface energy between P3HT and the substrate. Our method successfully fabricates micropatterns smaller than approximately 200 nm in size and an OTFT with 20 μm hexagonal active channel microdomains of P3HT by PEPTP exhibits a carrier mobility of approximately 0.02 cm2V−1 s−1 with a relatively high on/off ratio of 6 × 103 when an Au source and drain are utilized with a silicon oxide gate dielectric.
Experimental
Thin film formation and PEPTP patterning
Regioregular P3HT (Mw = 87000 g mol−1 with 98.5% head to tail regioregularity) was purchased from Aldrich and used without further purification. The P3HT solutions were prepared in chloroform (CHCl3) with various concentrations of 0.5–3 wt%. The procedure of PEPTP is schematically illustrated in Fig. 1. A thin film was deposited on a patterned poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) mold viaspin casting (SPIN 1200 Midas-system, Korea) at 2000 rpm and directly transferred to the various substrates with difference surface energies as shown in Table 1. The transfer of the P3HT film onto a substrate was facilitated by oxygen plasma treatment of both P3HT and the substrate for 1 min with a power of 6.8 W (PDC-32 G Harrick Plasma, USA) which significantly improves the adhesion between the two surfaces as shown later. The removal of the PDMS pattern after the conformal contact for 1 min produces a patterned P3HT thin film on the substrate at room temperature without additional heat and pressure applied.

Mold fabrication
An elastomeric PDMS mold was fabricated by curing a PDMS precursor (Sylgard 184, Dow Corning Corp) on a pre-patterned silicon master. We used a mixture of PDMS precursor and curing agent (10 : 1 by weight) that had been degassed under vacuum. The pre-patterned photoresist masters were prepared by either standard photolithography or nanoimprinting lithography, and the surface of a master was fluorinated before casting the PDMS precursor on the master. After the PDMS precursor was cured at 60 °C for 6 h using a vacuum oven, the mold was separated from the master. The PDMS molds with 1-dimensional periodic line have several sizes ranging from 100 μm to 100 nm. In addition 2-dimensional PDMS molds were prepared with both hexagonal holes and mesas of 20 μm in size arrayed into hexagonal p6mm symmetry. The center-to-center distance between two hexagons is 25 μm for both molds.

          OTFT fabrication
Bottom contact devices with 10 μm channel length were fabricated by a combination of conventional photolithography for source and drain electrodes and PEPTP for deposition of P3HT. The 100 nm thick Au source and drain electrodes on the 200 nm silicon oxide gate dielectric thermally grown on a heavily boron-doped Si (ρ = 0.005 Ω m) gate electrode were defined with conventional photolithography and subsequent lift-off after thermal deposition of Au at the LG Philips LCD. An active P3HT layer spin coated on a PDMS mold from 1 wt% solution was aligned and transferred to the source and drain electrodes using PEPTP. The subsequent annealing at 190 °C (Linkem THMSE 600) under N2 atmosphere for 30 min enables us not only to improve the crystallinity of the P3HT layer but also to promote a proper crystal orientation for high carrier mobility.4
Measurement and characterization
The electrical properties of the OTFT devices were measured using a semiconductor parameter analyzer (E5270B, HP4284A, Agilent Technologies). All measurements were done in a dark box at room temperature. The morphology of transferred and patterned thin films was observed by both conventional and fluorescence optical microscopy (Olympus BX 51 M) in both reflection and transmission modes. The micropatterns were also characterized with SEM (Hitachi: S-2700) operated at 10 kV. A thin gold or platinum layer with a thickness of 5 nm was deposited on the samples. AFM (Nanoscope IV from Digital Instrument) was used in tapping mode to obtain information about the pattern surface and film thickness. Grazing incidence wide angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) was performed on the 4C2 beam line at the Pohang Accelerator Laboratory in Korea (incidence angle: 0.09–0.15°). The samples were mounted on an x and y axes goniometer. Monochromatized X-rays (λ = 0.1608 nm) under vacuum and the full range of available incidence angles were used. The scattered beam intensity was recorded with an SCX: 4300-165/2 CCD detector (Princeton Instruments). 2D GIWAXS patterns were obtained in the range 0 < qz < 2.33 Å−1, 0 < qxy < 2.33 Å−1 (q = 4π sinθ/λ, with z perpendicular and xy parallel to the substrate). Water contact angles of various substrates were measured with a video contact angle system (AST 2500XE).
Results and discussion
The PEPTP method successfully produced various P3HT micropatterns on oxide Si surfaces even without oxygen plasma treatment as shown in Fig. 2a–d. Hexagons of 20 μm of P3HT arrayed into p6 mm symmetry are visible in large area under fluorescence microscope and the characteristic fluorescence of P3HT was preserved after pattern transfer from the mold near 650 nm in Fig. 2a. The pattern is highly uniform with the thickness of approximately 50 nm, measured by FESEM shown in the inset of Fig. 2a. A P3HT film spin coated on a PDMS mold with hexagonal holes was also transferred with ease (Fig. 2b) and the surface profile of the pattern obtained from a tapping mode AFM image confirms the thickness of the pattern with uniformity.

Hexagonal P3HT microdomains of 20 μm in size are arrayed into a p6mm symmetry and are visible in both (a) and a SEM image in the inset of (a). Reverse hexagons with 20 μm size and lines with 500 and 200 nm sixe are also shown in (b), (c) and (d). In the inset of (b), the height profile of the pattern with AFM measurement presents a sharp pattern edge with a thickness of approximately 100 nm. The inset of (d) displays a 3D visualization of (d). (e) Conversion ratio of the pattern transfer, defined by the ratio of the area transferred to that of the initial mold, as a function of the size of periodic lines in PDMS molds. (f) Variation of water contact angle of a P3HT thin film with oxygen plasma treatment for 1 min as a function of waiting time in the air. The contact angle increases and saturates eventually even for long waiting time, 3000 min at 52°, much lower that the value of 115° for the untreated P3HT thin film. 
The layer thickness of a transferred P3HT film was controlled by both solution concentration and spin speed. Typically we used 1 wt% solution at 2000 rpm which gives rise to approximately 50 nm thick films. One of the prerequisites for successful transfer of a thin film is to prepare a thin film separated between elevated and recessed regions of a PDMS mold. When a homogeneous and continuous film was formed on a PDMS mold from a solution with relatively high concentration, our method transferred the whole film to a substrate. Both size and height of elevated microstructure are, therefore, important to guarantee successful pattern transfer. The PDMS molds used in Fig. 2a and b are both 3 μm in height and do not have any difficulty in fabricating P3HT patterns less than 150 nm in thickness. Fig. 2c shows an example of 100 nm thick P3HT periodic lines whose width and period are 500 and 700 nm, respectively, transferred onto a Si substrate. Our method also produced a line pattern in which 200 nm wide lines with 50 nm height were well transferred without pressure and heat as shown in Fig. 2d.
We measured the efficiency of pattern transfer by calculating the ratio of film transferred to one on a PDMS mold with dimensions of 1 × 1 cm2. The method is very effective for fabricating a P3HT periodic line micropattern with width greater than a few microns with conversion greater than 85% (Fig. 2e). The conversion decreased to approximately 60% when the line width of the PDMS mold was 200 nm. Incomplete transfer occurred just near the edges of the mold due to the lack of conformal contact with the substrate. When a PDMS mold with size less than 100 nm was employed, there was almost no transfer onto the substrate due to the formation of a homogeneous film on the PDMS mold in spite of the high aspect ratio of the PDMS pattern of approximately 1. Pattern transfer was, however, achieved after dip coating the P3HT solution on the PDMS pattern, which ensured the thin film on the elevated regions was separated from the film on the recessed ones. PEPTP is found to be highly effective for patterning thin P3HT films with dimensions on the hundreds of nanometers scale that are in general sufficiently small for active channel layers in conventional OTFT arrays.
The material transfer in particular in thin films from one layer to another layer is mainly governed by the difference of work of adhesion (T) involved in the surface tension of each layer. In order for pattern transfer to occur, the work of adhesion at the PDMS mold and P3HT interface (WPDMS/P3HT) should be less than that at the P3HT and substrate interface (WP3HT/SUB), i.e.T(= WP3HT/SUB − WPDMS/P3HT) > 0. The work of adhesion at layers 1 and 2 is generally given by:27  where γp and γd correspond to polar and dispersion component of overall surface tension (γ = γp + γd), respectively. The surface tension of P3HT used in the current work was calculated from the geometric-mean method based on the equation: (1 + cosθt)γt = 2{(γtdγsd)1/2 + (γtpγsp)1/2},27,28 where θ is the contact angle of a testing liquid on P3HT surface and γt and γs is surface energy of testing liquid and solid surface. Water and ethylene glycol were used as testing liquids required for the calculation of γP3HTp and γP3HTd. Based on contact angles of 110 and 70° for water and ethylene glycol on a thin P3HT film surface, γP3HTp and γP3HTd were obtained as 35.9 and 0.1 mJ m−2, respectively. The overall surface energy of P3HT (36 mJ m−2) is very similar to the value (35 mJ m−2) reported for a polythiophene.26 Surface energies from the literature shown in Table 1 are of all other innate substrates before plasma treatment. The work of adhesion between PDMS and P3HT calculated from the surface energy of each material is 50.1 mJ m−2 (Table 1). It is obvious that a thin P3HT film tends to stay on the mold rather than be transferred to a substrate unless the work of adhesion between P3HT and the substrate is sufficiently larger than 50.1 mJ m−2. For the Si substrate with native oxide layer we employed in Fig. 2, the work of adhesion with P3HT was 65.7 mJ m−2 with a T value of 15.6, which indicates successful pattern transfer, consistent with our experimental results in Fig. 2. It should be noted that we reduced the removal rate of the PDMS mold during pattern transfer to less than 0.01 cm s−1 to minimize the kinetic effect on work of adhesion that becomes more sensitive with the removal rate.29
The pattern transfer of a P3HT film on a PDMS mold was significantly facilitated with oxygen plasma treatment on both the P3HT film and the substrate. In fact the benefits of the P3HT pattern transfer with the plasma treatment include the formation of a sharper pattern edge, shorter conformal contact time (less than 5 s) and better adhesion of P3HT with the substrate. As shown in Table 1, oxygen plasma treatment enhances the polar component of the surface energy while reducing the dispersion component at the same time due to the introduction of polar hydroxyl groups on a substrate exposed to oxygen plasma. Approximately 1 min plasma treatment was sufficient for successful pattern transfer under our experimental conditions. In fact, the surface energy of a film remains similar even at longer exposure time. The work of adhesion between P3HT and Si wafer becomes 152.2 mJ m−2 after plasma treatment on both surfaces, giving rise to a T value of 102.1. Compared with the T value of 15.6 without plasma treatment, one can easily expect much more effective pattern transfer with the oxygen plasma. We also estimated the variation of water contact angle of an oxygen plasma treated P3HT film as a function of waiting time after the treatment. The contact angle rapidly increased up to approximately 50° within 1 h after the sample was exposed to air and slowly changed to 53° with time and finally remained unaltered for a long time as shown in Fig. 2f. The efficient pattern transfer of a P3HT film with oxygen plasma occurred even after 7 days.
One of the advantages of our method lies in the fact that a variety of substrates with different surface energies can be used for P3HT patterning. We applied more than 9 substrates listed in Table 1 whose surface energies vary from approximately 16 to 71 dyn cm−1. For example, the pattern transfer to a 1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorodecyltrichlorosilane (FDTS) treated SiO2 substrate (γ = 16.1 dyn cm−1) did not happen due to the negative T value of −12.4. In contrast a thin P3HT film on a PDMS mold was successfully transferred to the same substrate with FDTS after oxygen plasma treatment as shown in Fig. 3a, which is also consistent with the T value (+94.2). As shown in Table 1, the oxygen plasma treatment for 1 min gives rise to significantly enhanced T values larger than +85 for all the substrates we employed mainly due to strong polar–polar interactions between P3HT and substrates, which renders our method powerful.

A reverse hexagonal P3HT micropattern was obtained by pattern transfer to FDTS modified glass after 1 min plasma treatment in (a). Hexagonal P3HT microdomains are successfully formed on the PS surface without harming its properties in (b). The inset shows a flexible P3HT pattern on a PS substrate. 
Another advantage of PEPTP is the patterning capability on polymeric substrates, in particular those which are subject to damage by organic solvents. Spin coating of a P3HT solution in chloroform, for instance, on a poly(styrene) (PS) substrate usually results in a significant surface deterioration of the PS layer caused by attack of the solvent, and a bilayer of the two polymers is rarely achieved. On the other hand the direct transfer of a thin solid P3HT film spin coated on a PDMS mold in our method can avoid this problem. Fig. 3b displays a P3HT micropattern of the hexagonal mesa arrays formed on a PS substrate. The P3HT microdomains are transferred onto a PS thin layer spin coated on a Kapton polyimide (PI) film commercially available as shown in the inset of Fig. 3b. It is obvious that numerous conventional polymers have been conveniently patterned by our method including poly(styrene), poly(vinylpyridine), poly(methylmethacrylate) and even block copolymers such as poly(styrene-b-ethylene oxide) and so on.
In order to fabricate a bottom gate OTFT device combined with our PEPTP, a P3HT pattern on a PDMS mold was manually controlled and transferred on patterned Au source and drain electrodes to give a P3HT channel between the electrodes as depicted in Fig. 4a. Due to the low crystallinity of the as-transferred semiconducting P3HT film characterized with grazing incidence wide angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) (ESI†), we annealed the film at 190 °C under N2 atmosphere for 2 hs, which also provides firm adhesion with both electrodes and dielectric by removing the voids or defects arising from the topology of the two electrodes as depicted in Fig. 4a. The optical micrograph shown in Fig. 4b exhibits a P3HT channel formed between two electrodes after thermal annealing. The 2D GIWAXS pattern revealed the crystal structure of the annealed film as shown in Fig. 4c. The annealing significantly improved the crystallinity of the film with a preferred ordering of the crystals, compared with that of an as-transferred one. The (100) reflection near qz ∼ 0.38 Å−1 and other high order {100} ones dominantly appear at the meridian with a weak (010) reflection, which implies that the a-axis of the P3HT crystals is preferentially oriented perpendicular to the substrate, apart from a small portion of crystals having the b-axis perpendicular to the substrate.30 The edge-on crystalline lamellae with the a-axis parallel to the surface normal that we observed are known to be beneficial for carrier transport because of the effective π–π inter-chain stacking between source and drain electrodes.1,3

(b) An OM image of a device manufactured by our method. The Au source and drain electrode are apparent with a 20 μm P3HT hexagon channel. (c) 2D GIWAXS pattern of the patterned and annealed P3HT film. The intense {100} reflections are located on the meridian with a weak halo of the (010) reflection, which implies that the a-axis of P3HT crystals is dominantly oriented perpendicular to the substrate, leading to an efficient lamellae packing between source and drain electrodes for device performance. (d) Output characteristic and (e) transfer characteristic (left line) and linear plot of ID1/2 as a function of VG (right line) of the device with a P3HT thin film patterned by PEPTP on an OTS modified SiO2 gate dielectric. The carrier mobility and on/off ratio of the device are found to be approximately 0.022 cm2V−1 s−1 and 103, respectively. 
The device exhibits linear/saturation behavior at operating voltages ranging 0 to 40 V and typical p-type drain current modulation under negative gate voltage (ESI†). The field-effect mobility is calculated from the slope of the plot of the square root of the drain current (IDS) versus gate voltage (VG) in the saturated regime, using the following equation: IDS = (W/2L)Ciμ(VG − Vth)2, where W and L are the width and length of the channel and Ci, μ and Vth correspond to the capacitance per unit area of the gate insulator, the channel mobility and threshold voltage, respectively. The field-effect mobility is 0.02 cm2V−1 s−1 and the on/off ratio is approximately 103 with the subthreshold swing of 4.10 mV decade−1 (Table 2). The performance of the device with the P3HT pattern fabricated by PEPTP is very comparable and sometimes even slightly better than that of a top-contact device prepared by conventional spin coating and source/drain electrode deposition as shown in Table 2, which indicates that the contact between the P3HT and either SiO2 gate dielectric or Au electrodes becomes sufficiently stable by direct transfer and thermal annealing. Source/drain Au films of the top-contact device were patterned on a P3HT film through a shadow mask at room temperature by thermal evaporation. The P3HT channel length and width were 200 μm and 2000 μm, respectively. We also fabricated a P3HT OTFT based on our method in which a self assembled monolayer (SAM) of octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS) was formed on a SiO2 dielectric for improved performance. The output and transfer characteristics of the OTFT are shown in Fig. 4d and e, respectively. The performance of the device is in general similar within experimental uncertainty to that of a device without SAMs in our case in spite of the better device performance reported previously (Table 2). It should be also noted that the oxygen trapped between P3HT and SiO2 dielectric in the case of pattern transfer with oxygen plasma gave rise to a shift of the turn-on voltage of approximately 10 V. We are systematically investigating the effect of oxygen plasma applied during PEPTP on device performance correlated with the surface chemistry of P3HT and SiO2 surface modified by plasma.

Conclusion
We demonstrated a patterning method, plasma enhanced polymer transfer printing (PEPTP), based on the direct transfer of a thin solid polymer film spin coated on a patterned PDMS mold to a substrate with the assistance of oxygen plasma as surface energy modifier. Various polymer films including semiconducting P3HT thin films were conveniently micro-/nanopatterned on various substrates including Si wafer, SiO2, SAM modified SiO2 and PS and so on within a minute over a large area. Control of work of adhesion between P3HT and substrate was essential for pattern transfer and was successfully accomplished by the application of oxygen plasma. We thoroughly investigated the interplay of surface energy modification and polymer film transfer. A bottom contact OTFT with a P3HT active layer, patterned by PEPTP and thermally annealed to improve both crystallinity and orientation of crystals on both SiO2 and OTS modified SiO2 gate dielectrics, showed a carrier mobility and on/off ratio of approximately 0.02 cm2V−1 s−1 and 103, respectively, comparable with the results from top contact devices prepared by conventional means.

 	Fig. 2  Fluorescence (a) and bright field OM images (b–d) of P3HT films micropatterned on a Si wafer by PEPTP with different pattern geometry and size. Hexagonal P3HT microdomains of 20 μm in size are arrayed into a p6mm symmetry and are visible in both (a) and a SEM image in the inset of (a). Reverse hexagons with 20 μm size and lines with 500 and 200 nm sixe are also shown in (b), (c) and (d). In the inset of (b), the height profile of the pattern with AFM measurement presents a sharp pattern edge with a thickness of approximately 100 nm. The inset of (d) displays a 3D visualization of (d). (e) Conversion ratio of the pattern transfer, defined by the ratio of the area transferred to that of the initial mold, as a function of the size of periodic lines in PDMS molds. (f) Variation of water contact angle of a P3HT thin film with oxygen plasma treatment for 1 min as a function of waiting time in the air. The contact angle increases and saturates eventually even for long waiting time, 3000 min at 52°, much lower that the value of 115° for the untreated P3HT thin film.

OM images of P3HT thin films patterned by PEPTP on (a) SAM modified glass and (b) polystyrene spin coated on Kapton polyimide film. A reverse hexagonal P3HT micropattern was obtained by pattern transfer to FDTS modified glass after 1 min plasma treatment in (a). Hexagonal P3HT microdomains are successfully formed on the PS surface without harming its properties in (b). The inset shows a flexible P3HT pattern on a PS substrate.	 

 	Fig. 4  (a) Schematic of bottom contact OTFT fabricated with PEPTP. On the pre-patterned Au source and drain electrodes on the 200 nm silicon oxide by conventional photolithography and subsequent lift-off, a P3HT thin film is transferred with PEPTP and thermally annealed at 190 °C for 30 min. (b) An OM image of a device manufactured by our method. The Au source and drain electrode are apparent with a 20 μm P3HT hexagon channel. (c) 2D GIWAXS pattern of the patterned and annealed P3HT film. The intense {100} reflections are located on the meridian with a weak halo of the (010) reflection, which implies that the a-axis of P3HT crystals is dominantly oriented perpendicular to the substrate, leading to an efficient lamellae packing between source and drain electrodes for device performance. (d) Output characteristic and (e) transfer characteristic (left line) and linear plot of ID1/2 as a function of VG (right line) of the device with a P3HT thin film patterned by PEPTP on an OTS modified SiO2 gate dielectric. The carrier mobility and on/off ratio of the device are found to be approximately 0.022 cm2V−1 s−1 and 103, respectively.
