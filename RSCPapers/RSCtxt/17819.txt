    , Accepted 20th September 2022First published on 22nd September 2022AbstractIntegrating bifunctional electrocatalysts into one electrolytic cell for water electrolysis has exhibited great convenience and high efficiency in green hydrogen production. However, the opportune adsorptions of intermediate oxygen and hydrogen species on catalytic active sites are prerequisites for the design of high-performing bifunctional electrocatalysts to simultaneously drive oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions (OER/HER). In this work, we developed a dual metal doping strategy to manipulate the d-band centers of non-precious transition metal phosphides aiming at optimal intermediate adsorption towards robust overall water splitting. The Ni and Mn atom incorporated FeP nanoarrays (Ni–Mn–FeP) were grown directly on NiFe foam via sequential etching-depositing and phosphorization processes. As for the well-known sluggish OER process, Ni–Mn–FeP only requires an overpotential of 185 mV to deliver 10 mA cm−2 in alkaline media. Meanwhile, the HER can also be driven at a low overpotential of 103 mV. In particular, when bifunctional Ni–Mn–FeP as both the cathode and anode is assembled into an electrolytic cell, the electrolysis current of 100 mA cm−2 can be easily achieved at a low cell voltage of 1.55 V and the stability at 500 mA cm−2 can last for 360 h, implying great prospects for large-scale applications. The d-band center theory indicated that the intrinsic high electroactivity of bifunctional Ni–Mn–FeP should arise from the doping induced notable promotions in *O to *OOH conversion and H* adsorption processes. The collaboration approach of codoped low-valence and high-valence metals may inspire the development of high-performance and versatile catalysts.
1. Introduction
Since the concept of a hydrogen economy was proposed in the 1970s, hydrogen energy has been widely considered as one of the ideal energy carriers due to its high energy density and environmental friendliness.1 Electrocatalytic water splitting has been regarded as the most promising and sustainable strategy in comparison with conventional methane reforming and coal gasification, especially in the context of the carbon emission peak and carbon neutrality.2,3 When driven by wind and solar energy sources, water electrolysis enables intermittent and renewable energy conversion and storage in the form of hydrogen energy. Although the total hydrogen consumption market approximately reaches up to $155 billion in 2022, high production costs mainly caused by the low efficiency of power utilization and high price of precious metal catalysts make water electrolysis hold a mere minor fraction of about 4%. Moreover, the water-splitting reaction is composed of two half reactions i.e. the anodic OER and cathodic HER.4,5 Integrating bifunctional electrocatalysts into one electrolytic cell for hydrogen production potentially exhibited great convenience and high efficiency in large-scale applications.6,7 Therefore, developing cost-effective and high-activity bifunctional electrocatalysts is highly demanded.
The last few decades have witnessed tremendous research progress in the replacement of precious metal catalysts with transition metal catalysts. Typically, transition metal oxides8,9 and hydroxides10,11 have been generally proven as promising catalysts toward the OER, while nitrides,12,13 carbides,14,15 chalcogenides,16–18 and phosphides19–21 possess desirable activity toward the HER. Among them, transition metal phosphides (TMPs) are reputed to be a type of quasi-platinum catalyst due to their high mechanical strength, electrical and chemical stabilities as well as abundant coordinate unsaturated surface atoms. Recently, the doping strategy has been proven to be effective in promoting HER performance and endowing TMPs with OER activity.22,23 Normally, doping can not only benefit the evolution process of oxygen/hydrogen-containing intermediates, but also create new active sites on the doped metal atoms for the OER.24,25 Noticeably, this category of work is mainly attributed to the synergetic effect between the host TMPs and the dopants. The electronic structure origin of intrinsic activity promotion in the dopant modulated TMPs remains unclear for both the OER and HER. Very recently, the d-band center (εd) theory was reported as an emerging standard to evaluate the adsorption and desorption abilities towards oxygen/hydrogen-containing intermediates for OER and HER electrocatalysts.26,27 Thus, how to effectively modulate the energy level of εdvia the transition-metal doping strategy to further inspire the construction of high-performance bifunctional electrocatalysts is a new and important issue for water splitting.
Owing to the multiple valences, abundant reserves, and especially the similar atomic radius to Fe, Co and Ni, Mn has been considered as a promising dopant for Fe, Co and Ni based catalysts. It is reported that Mn doping can effectively tune the electronic structure and optimize the electroconductivity of catalysts, leading to enhanced catalytic activity.28–30 Herein, we prepared Ni and Mn atom incorporated FeP nanoarrays (Ni–Mn–FeP) grown directly on NiFe foam through sequential etching-depositing and phosphorization processes. Ni–Mn–FeP exhibits superior electrocatalytic activity, fast reaction kinetics and long-time durability toward the OER and HER in alkaline electrolyte. In particular, when utilized in an electrolytic cell as both the anode and cathode, Ni–Mn–FeP only requires a voltage of 1.55 V to drive water splitting at a current density of 100 mA cm−2. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations suggest that the co-doping of low-valence and high-valence metal atoms leads to an elaborate modulation in εd of Ni–Mn–FeP. The appropriate increase in εd of Ni–Mn–FeP should benefit the conversion of *O to *OOH in the OER and the H* adsorption in the HER, thereby delivering a robust water splitting process.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Chemicals and reagents
NiFe foam (Ni:Fe = 7:3, 1.5 mm thickness), Ni foam and Fe foam of the same specifications were purchased from Kunshan Kuangxun electrical Co., Ltd (Kunshan, China). Commercial Ruthenium dioxide (RuO2, 99.9%) and Pt/C (20% Pt) were purchased from Shanghai Aladdin Biochemical Technology Co., Ltd (Shanghai, China). NaCl (≥99.0%), MnCl2·4H2O (≥99.0%), NaH2PO2·2H2O (≥99.0%), KOH (≥95.0%) and absolute ethanol (analytical reagent) were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd (Shanghai, China). The deionized water (DI water, >18.0 MΩ) was prepared by an Ultrapure purification system. All chemicals and reagents were used as received.
2.2 Synthesis of Ni–Mn–FeOH
NiFe foam (1.5 mm thickness) with a size of 0.5 cm × 4 cm was pretreated with 2 M HCl, and then cleaned adequately with deionized water and ethanol, respectively. After being dried in an Ar flow, the pretreated NiFe foam was immersed in an aqueous solution containing 1000 mM NaCl and 10 mM MnCl2, and then shaken for 12 h at room temperature at 180 rpm. The resultant NiMnFe hydroxide nanosheet arrays supported on NiFe foam (denoted as Ni–Mn–FeOH) were then rinsed thoroughly with deionized water and ethanol and vacuum dried for 6 h. NiFe hydroxides (denoted as Ni–FeOH) were prepared via a similar process without MnCl2 in the mixed solution. MnFe hydroxides (denoted as Mn–FeOH) and Mn–Ni hydroxides (denoted as Mn–NiOH) were prepared with Fe foam and Ni foam as substrates, respectively.
2.3 Synthesis of Ni–Mn–FeP
The as-prepared Ni–Mn–FeOH was placed in a porcelain boat on the downstream side of the tube furnace, with 1.0 g of NaH2PO2 in another porcelain boat on the upstream side as a phosphorus source. Then, with a heat rate of 2 °C per minute, the tube furnace was heated to 350 °C in an Ar atmosphere and kept for 2 hours. After being naturally cooled to ambient temperature, NiMnFe phosphides (denoted as Ni–Mn–FeP) supported on NiFe foam were obtained. NiFe phosphides (denoted as Ni–FeP), MnFe phosphides (denoted as Mn–FeP) and MnNi phosphides (denoted as Mn–NiP) were prepared via a similar process.
Experimental details for characterization studies, electrochemical measurements and DFT calculations are supplied in the ESI.†
3. Results and discussion
The Ni and Mn atom incorporated FeP nanoarrays (Ni–Mn–FeP) were grown directly on the NiFe foam substrate through a facile room temperature etching-depositing and then a low-temperature phosphorization process. As illustrated in Scheme 1, the etching-depositing procedure was conducted by immersing NiFe foam into an aqueous solution containing NaCl and MnCl2. The collaboration of dissolved O2 and highly concentrated Cl− can efficiently etch the surface of NiFe foam to release Ni2+ and Fe2+. As the released Fe2+ was oxidized to Fe3+, the ternary Ni–Mn–Fe hydroxides were deposited onto the surface of NiFe foam in the form of nanosheet arrays. Note that the resultant Ni–Mn–FeP demonstrates the morphology of nanorod arrays after phosphorization treatment. The high temperature and surface ion exchange during the chemical vapor deposition process should be responsible for the formation of a nanorod shape in Ni–Mn–FeP.31,32
 Scheme 1  Schematic illustration for the synthesis of Ni–Mn–FeP. 
X-Ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of Ni–Mn–FeP and Ni–FeP are shown in Fig. 1a. It can be observed that Ni–Mn–FeP exhibits similar diffraction peaks to Ni–FeP, which can be ascribed to FeP (#39-0809). The XRD patterns further prove that the Mn doping did not change the phase composition. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images with different magnifications in Fig. 1b, c, and S1† show that the as-prepared Ni–Mn–FeP exhibits a three-dimensional structure composed of interlaced nanorod arrays, while Ni–FeP tends to show the morphology of interlaced nanosheets (Fig. S2†). The precursor Ni–Mn–FeOH demonstrates the morphology of nanosheets as shown in Fig. S3.† The shape evolution is consistent with the description in Scheme 1. The unique three-dimensional structure with large surface areas (BET specific surface area = 32.7 m2 g−1, Fig. S4†) and continuous channels can efficiently achieve the facile mass/electron exchange of different intermediates in the OER and HER processes.33,34 The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image (Fig. 1d) further reveals the nanorod morphology of Ni–Mn–FeP. The length of Ni–Mn–FeP nanorods is estimated to be in the range of 50 to 100 nm and the diameter of nanorods is about 20–30 nm. The nanorods are highly cross-linked with each other, thereby providing a highly exposed surface of active sites. As indicated in the high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) image (Fig. 1e), the interplanar spacings of 0.273, 0.242, and 0.188 nm correspond well to the (011), (111), (211) planes of FeP. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern in Fig. 1f displays the diffraction rings with different reciprocal distances, which can be indexed to the (011), (111), (310) and (222) crystal planes of FeP. The TEM-EDS mapping (Fig. 1g) reveals the uniform distribution of Fe, Mn, Ni, and P elements throughout Ni–Mn–FeP nanorods. Detailed elemental contents of the prepared catalysts are provided in Fig. S5.† Taken together, the self-supported Ni–Mn–FeP featuring nanorod arrays directly grown on NiFe foam was prepared through a facile room temperature etching–depositing and then a low-temperature phosphorization process. The XRD, HRTEM and SAED results confirmed that the main crystalline phase in Ni–Mn–FeP was FeP and Ni and Mn existed in the form of dopants.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was employed to determine the chemical compositions and states. The full survey spectra shown in Fig. S6† confirm the coexistence of Fe, Mn, Ni, and P elements in Ni–Mn–FeP. Fig. 2a displays the high-resolution XPS spectra of Fe 2p in Ni–Mn–FeP, Ni–FeP and Ni–Mn–FeOH. Typically, the paired peaks located at 706.8 and 720.0 eV indicate the existence of Fe–P bonding in Ni–Mn–FeP and Ni–FeP. The signals that occurred at about 710.1 and 712.4 eV suggest the presence of Fe3+ and Fe2+ species, which should come from the surface oxidized Fe–POx species.35,36 When compared with the references Ni–FeP and Ni–Mn–FeOH, it can be clearly observed that the phosphorization treatment led to a significant negative shift of binding energy by about 0.7 eV, and meanwhile Mn incorporation could facilitate the conversion of hydroxides to phosphides as indicated by the high Fe–P fraction in Ni–Mn–FeP. As for Ni 2p XPS spectra in Fig. 2b, the formation of Ni–P bonding was well indicated by the peaks of 852.8 and 870.2 eV (856.4 and 874.1 eV).37,38 Compared with Ni–Mn–FeOH, the phosphorization treatment resulted in an obvious positive shift of 1.0 eV. The Mn incorporation in Ni–Mn–FeP can not only lead to a negative shift of 0.5 eV but also increase the content of Ni–P in comparison with Ni–FeP. The observations verified that the Mn dopant can enhance the metallic features in Ni and Fe sites. The Mn 2p spectrum of Ni–Mn–FeP demonstrates the coexistence of three types of Mn2+, Mn3+ and Mn4+ species.39,40 Note that high-valence Mn4+ was only visible in Ni–Mn–FeP. According to previous reports, the high-valence metal species dopants enable more effective modulation of the electronic structure for electrocatalysts towards promoted HER and OER processes. In the P 2p spectra shown in Fig. 2d, the peaks at 129.2 and 130.1 eV belong to the 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 of the P-metal bond, while the peak with a binding energy of 134.4 eV can be attributed to P–O resulting from the oxidation of surface phosphides.41 Therefore, the chemical compositions and oxidation states of Ni–Mn–FeP were fully analyzed, meanwhile the potential roles of dopants in the electronic structure modulation were expected.

The OER and HER tests of Ni–Mn–FeP were both conducted in 1 M KOH electrolyte (the optimization experiments on the Mn content are shown in Fig. S7†). Ni–FeP, Ni–Mn–FeOH, and NiFe, and commercial RuO2 and Pt/C were studied for comparison. The catalytic performances of Mn–FeP and Mn–NiP are also provided for comparison in Fig. S8.†Fig. 3a displays the polarization curves of the OER test. Ni–Mn–FeP requires overpotentials of 185 (confirmed by the reverse LSV curve, Fig. S9†) and 205 mV to deliver the current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm−2, which are 40 and 58 mV less than that of the RuO2 catalyst. Besides, the overpotentials of Ni–Mn–FeP are significantly lower than those of Ni–FeP, implying that the activity improvement should be induced by Mn incorporation. The Tafel slope and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were analyzed to investigate the catalytic reaction kinetics. As shown in Fig. 3b, Ni–Mn–FeP exhibits a Tafel slope of 49.4 mV dec−1, smaller than that of RuO2 (54.4 mV dec−1) and Ni–FeP (61.0 mV dec−1). The smallest Tafel slope of 49.4 mV dec−1 indicates the favorable OER kinetics and reveals that the rate-determining step is the conversion of *O to *OOH, consistent with the DFT calculations.42,43Fig. 3c displays the Nyquist plots for the OER of the catalysts and RuO2, in which the diameter of the semicircle represents the charge-transfer resistance (Rct).44 Ni–Mn–FeP exhibits a Rct of 0.92 Ω, which is smaller than 0.95 Ω of Ni–FeP, 1.38 Ω of RuO2,1.52 Ω of Ni–Mn–FeOH and 2.16 Ω of NiFe. The findings from the Tafel slope and EIS results indicate the fast charge transfer process in Ni–Mn–FeP during the OER process.

(i) Chronopotentiometric curves for the OER and HER at 500 mA cm−2 for Ni–Mn–FeP. 
The HER catalytic performance was also evaluated by using polarization curves, as presented in Fig. 3d. Ni–Mn–FeP requires an overpotential of 103 mV to achieve 10 mA cm−2, which is 16 mV higher than that of Pt/C but 43 mV lower than that of Ni–FeP. When the current densities continue to go higher, the advantages of Ni–Mn–FeP become increasingly clear. For instance, at a current density of 100 mA cm−2, the HER activity of Ni–Mn–FeP (η100, 177 mV) exceeds that of benchmark Pt/C (η100, 268 mV) and Ni–FeP (η100, 290 mV). When compared at a high current density of 500 mA cm−2, the η500 of Ni–Mn–FeP is approximately 243 mV, significantly superior to 410 mV of Pt/C. The LSV results indicate that Ni–Mn–FeP can be operated at a high current density for the HER, implying great promise in large-scale application toward hydrogen production. Fig. 3e presents the Tafel plots of different catalysts for the HER, in which the Volmer, Heyrovsky, or Tafel component can be given by the Tafel slopes. Ni–Mn–FeP exhibits a Tafel slope of 71.6 mV dec−1, smaller than that of the benchmark Pt/C catalyst (74.4 mV dec−1) and other reference samples. The result indicates fast HER kinetics in Ni–Mn–FeP. The Heyrovsky reaction in the Volmer–Heyrovsky mechanism should be the rate-limiting step.45,46Fig. 3f presents the Nyquist plots collected at an overpotential of 200 mV for the HER, in which the Rct for Ni–Mn–FeP, Ni–FeP, Ni–Mn–FeOH, and Pt/C are 10.8, 20.2, 35.7 and 11.1 Ω. The small Rct illustrates the faster charge transport process in Ni–Mn–FeP during the HER. The overpotentials for the as-prepared catalysts and relative commercial catalysts to achieve a current density of 10 and 100 mA cm−2 for the OER and HER are comparatively displayed in Fig. 3g, intuitively revealing the superior catalytic activity of Ni–Mn–FeP toward the OER and HER.
To explore the cause of the high HER and OER activities, electrochemical active surface areas (ECSAs) were calculated according to double-layer capacitance (Cdl, Fig. S10 to S15†). As illustrated in Fig. 3h, Ni–Mn–FeP possesses a Cdl value of 35.68 mF cm−2 (ECSA = 892.0 cm2), much larger than that of Ni–FeP (21.29 mF cm−2, ECSA = 532.3 cm2), RuO2 (5.44 mF cm−2, ECSA = 136.0 cm2), and Pt/C (17.92 mF cm−2, ECSA = 448.0 cm2). The larger ECSA suggests more catalytic active sites exposed on the interlaced nanorod array structure.47 The smaller charge–transfer resistance and larger active surface area can be considered to contribute to the outstanding catalytic activity.48–50 ECSA-normalized LSV curves for the OER and HER were also calculated to further explore the instinct activity (Fig. S16a and S17a†). For the OER, at an overpotential of 250 mV, Ni–Mn–FeP exhibits an ECSA-normalized current density of 1.04 mA cm−2, 2.3 times that of RuO2 and 4.3 times that of Ni–FeP (Fig. S16b†). Besides, turnover frequencies (TOFs) at an overpotential of 250 mV were also calculated (Fig. S16c†). The TOF of Ni–Mn–FeP is 0.54 s−1, more than 2 times that of Ni–FeP and 4 times that of RuO2, respectively. For the HER, the ECSA normalized current density and TOF of Ni–Mn–FeP is 2.4 times and 4.3 times that of Ni–FeP, respectively (Fig. S17b and c†). The higher normalized current density and TOF for both the OER and HER adequately reveal the enhancement of catalytic activity of Ni–Mn–FeP. The long-term stability of Ni–Mn–FeP was also evaluated by conducting 120 h of chronopotentiometric tests at 500 mA cm−2 for the OER and HER. It was demonstrated that Ni–Mn–FeP possessed excellent stability for both the OER and HER (Fig. 3i). Additionally, the faradaic efficiency for the OER and HER was also calculated to be 97.3% and 98.6%, respectively (Fig. S18†).
SEM, TEM, XRD and XPS had been employed to characterize the structure and composition change of Ni–Mn–FeP after long time OER and HER tests. Fig. S19 and S20† display the SEM and TEM images of post-HER and post-OER Ni–Mn–FeP. It can be observed that Ni–Mn–FeP exhibits a partially amorphous fluffy dendritic and a partially amorphous nanoplate morphology after the OER and HER, respectively. The morphology changes suggest the surface reconstruction during long time OER and HER tests.51 Moreover, no distinct diffraction peaks were observed in the XRD patterns of post-HER and post-OER samples (Fig. 4a), indicating the degradation of the FeP phase and the formation of an amorphous phase. According to the high-resolution XPS spectra of Ni (Fig. 4b) and Fe (Fig. 4c), the contents of both the Fe–P bond and Ni–P bond decreased after the HER, but almost completely disappeared after the OER. For Mn 2p (Fig. 4d), the negative shift after the HER indicates the generation of low-valence Mn species, while the contents of high-valence Mn species increased after the OER test. The analysis of P 2p (Fig. 4e) and O 1s spectra (Fig. 4f) is consistent with the aforementioned findings. The metal-P partially remained after the HER test while the derived metal oxyhydroxides/phosphates should serve as the active site for the OER.26,52–54

To gain further insight into the relationship between the electronic structure regulation and the resultant improved catalytic performance induced by dual metal doping, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were carried out. Fig. 5a and b display the simulated models of Ni–FeP and Ni–Mn–FeP, while the optimized adsorption models of the intermediates during the OER and HER are shown in Fig. S21–S26.†Fig. 5c presents the calculated total density of states (TDOS) of Ni–Mn–FeP and Ni–FeP with the Fermi level aligned at 0 eV. Ni–Mn–FeP exhibits a much higher TDOS near the Fermi level, indicating that Mn doping can obviously increase the electrical conductivity. The Gibbs free energies of the elementary steps during the OER process were calculated and are revealed in Fig. 5d and Table S1.† The elementary step of converting *O to *OOH requires the largest Gibbs free energy change (ΔGIII) for all the involved catalysts, revealing it to be the rate determining step.23,55 The Ni site of Ni–Mn–FeP exhibits a ΔGIII of 3.045 eV, significantly smaller than that for the Fe site of Ni–Mn–FeP (3.572 eV), Ni site (4.166 eV) and Fe site (3.521 eV) of Ni–FeP. Thus, Mn doping can efficiently reduce the energy barrier for the OER by regulating the electronic structure of Ni, which results in a lower overpotential.56,57 The HER activity origin of Ni–Mn–FeP under alkaline conditions was well analysed in theory. Mn doping can also modulate the electronic structure of Ni and Fe sites, leading to favourable ΔG for key water adsorption and dissociation processes towards H* generation (Fig. S27†).58,59 Hydrogen adsorption Gibbs free energy (ΔGH*) can be employed to evaluate the HER activity by comparing the value of |ΔGH*|.60 The calculated ΔGH* on the Ni site of Ni–Mn–FeP is −0.046 eV (Fig. 5e), much closer to the optimal ΔGH* of 0 eV than that on other sites, implying the enhanced HER energetics, which can also be ascribed to the electronic structure regulation induced by Mn doping.

According to the d-band theory, the adsorption energy of reaction intermediates can be optimized with the d-band center (εd) of metal sites, which can be tuned by the interaction with other metal dopants.61,62 The calculated partial density of states (PDOS) displayed in Fig. 5f shows that the εd of Ni sites for both up and down spins are obviously positive shifted due to the Mn doping in comparison with Ni–FeP. In addition, as shown in Fig. 5g, the εd for the down spin of Fe sites witnesses a slight negative shift (−0.31 eV to −0.88 eV) while the up spin exhibits an obvious positive shift (−3.09 eV to 1.32 eV). The positive shifts of the εd of Ni and Fe can be further corroborated with the changes in binding energy as revealed in the XPS results (Fig. 2a and b). The significantly positive shifted εd causes stronger adsorption of intermediates during the OER, especially for *O compared with *OH, and consequently leads to decreased adsorption free energy of the rate determining step (Fig. 5d, ΔGIII).26,63 Thus, the OER kinetics on the Ni site of Ni–Mn–FeP is promoted and results in the lowest overpotential. In addition, the resultant εd of Ni sites is very close to −1.92 eV i.e. εd of Pt, indicating a more favorable hydrogen biding energy.64,65 Thus, the Ni dopant provides new and more active sites for both OER and HER processes. Importantly, the second Mn dopant plays a crucial role in modulating the electronic structure of Ni, thus leading to an optimal εd of Ni in Ni–Mn–FeP for the favorable adsorption of oxygen and hydrogen-containing intermediates.
Based on the outstanding catalytic activity toward the OER and HER, Ni–Mn–FeP was utilized in a two-electrode configuration as both the anode and cathode for overall water splitting in 1 M KOH electrolyte. Fig. 6a represents the polarization curves of Ni–Mn–FeP and relative catalysts for overall water splitting. Strikingly, Ni–Mn–FeP requires a cell voltage of 1.48 V to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm−2, and 1.55 V for 100 mA cm−2, much lower than that of the coupled benchmark RuO2‖Pt/C (1.51 V for 10 mA cm−2 and higher than 1.75 V for 100 mA cm−2), and superior to those of most previously reported bifunctional electrocatalysts (Table S2†). Aiming at the industrial application, the stability of bifunctional Ni–Mn–FeP towards overall water splitting was evaluated at a high current density of 500 mA cm−2. Notably, the activity can be well retained up to 360 h (Fig. 6b). The two-electrode configuration with Ni–Mn–FeP utilized as both the anode and cathode for water splitting can be powered by a solar cell and achieves continuous water splitting (Fig. 6c and d). Fig. 6e and Table S2† display the comparison of Ni–Mn–FeP with recently reported transition metal phosphide catalysts. It can be observed that Ni–Mn–FeP exhibits highly competitive catalytic performance toward the OER and HER, as well as a rather low cell voltage for overall water splitting, making it a promising catalyst for practical application.

4. Conclusions
In summary, we successfully developed a dual metal doping strategy to construct low-cost and high-performance transition-metal-phosphide-based bifunctional electrocatalysts for overall splitting. The as-prepared Ni–Mn–FeP achieves a current density of 10 mA cm−2 at an overpotential of 185 mV for the OER and 103 mV for the HER. Besides, a low cell voltage of 1.55 V is required to afford a current density of 100 mA cm−2 in an alkaline water electrolyzer, as well as superior stability for 360 h at 500 mA cm−2. The outstanding catalytic activities were mainly attributed to the optimal εd of metal phosphides. The Ni dopant provides new and more active sites for both OER and HER processes. The εd of Ni was well manipulated by the second Mn dopant. The Pt-like εd of Ni was suggested to be conducive to hydrogen adsorption, meanwhile the positively shifted εd of Ni and Fe should facilitate the rate determining step, i.e., *O to *OOH. The relationship between dual doping and the d-band center revealed in this paper may contribute to further studies of transition metal phosphides in electrocatalysis.
