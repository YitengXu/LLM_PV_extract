    , Accepted 20th December 2019First published on 23rd December 2019AbstractIn this work, a novel chalcopyrite (CuFeS2) platelet like open-pored micro-flower structured electrode material was synthesized via a one-step hydrothermal method and its electrochemical performance as an electrode material for supercapacitors were investigated. First and foremost, the structural, morphological, vibrational, and chemical compositional characteristics of the as prepared CuFeS2 were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) with elemental mapping, laser Raman spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), respectively. Subsequently, the electrochemical properties of the CuFeS2 electrode were explored using cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge–discharge (CD), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) studies in 1 M LiOH electrolyte. Cyclic voltammetry and charge–discharge analysis reveal the pseudocapacitive nature of the CuFeS2 electrode by obtaining a maximum specific capacity of about 26.46 mA h g−1 (specific capacitance of about ∼95.28 F g−1) at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1 with a cycling stability retention of 94.38% even after 2000 cycles at a discharge current rate of 5 mA. Furthermore, in view of practical application a symmetric supercapacitor device was fabricated using the CuFeS2 electrode which delivered a maximum specific capacitance of about 34.18 F g−1 at a current rate of 1 mA and a maximum energy density of about 4.74 W h kg−1 with excellent cycling stability. The acquired results confirmed that the CuFeS2 electrode could be a prospective and electrochemically active candidate for next generation supercapacitors.
1. Introduction
With the mounting requirement of unpolluted energy and the expeditious consumption of fossil fuels in the present days, society has a serious requirement to develop eco-friendly energy storage-conversion approaches to substitute conventional fossil fuel/non-renewable energy resources.1–5 In recent times, supercapacitors have motivated significant research into unconventional energy storage devices for contemporary electronics due to their admirable characteristics, including eco-friendly nature, fast charge–discharge rate, and ultrahigh power density.6–8 However, wide implementations of supercapacitors in our day to day life remain a question, with unfulfilled energy demands.9,10 Supercapacitor electrode materials, such as carbon-based materials, conducting polymers, metal organic frameworks (MOFs), transition metal chalcogenides (TMCs), and MXenes, displayed better electrochemical performances and have attracted substantial research interest in the past few years.11–17 Carbon-based materials (EDLC behaviour) have been commonly used as electrodes in commercial supercapacitors due to their exceptional cycling stability and high-power density, but they suffer from a lower energy density which cannot fulfill the demands of portable electronics. Conducting polymers (pseudocapacitive behaviour) such as polyaniline (PANI), polypyrrole (PPy), and polythiophene are also favourable electrode materials for supercapacitors due to their unique electrochemical properties but, conducting polymers show poor cycling stability performance during long-term charge–discharge.18,19 On the other hand, transition metal oxides (TMOs) (pseudocapacitive behaviour) also experience low electrical conductivity and unsatisfactory rate capability which restrict their wide-ranging commercialization.20 Therefore, development of highly electrical conductive, eco-friendly, and stable electrode materials for supercapacitors remains a motivating assignment for scientists.
Recently, transition metal sulfides (TMSs) have attracted tremendous attention for electrochemical energy storage (battery and supercapacitor) as well as for energy conversion devices due to their unique structure that enables a higher electrical conductivity, lower electronegativity, and better electrochemical performance compared to their corresponding oxides.21,22 In this scenario, chalcopyrite (CuFeS2) is the most exploited natural sulfide mineral in the Earth's crust for copper recovery.23 CuFeS2 has been artificially synthesized in the lab-scale by many researchers for research purpose in the past. CuFeS2 has been studied as an auspicious material for many applications such as energy storage,24 electrochemical sensors25 and solar energy conversion.26 The chemical and physical properties of CuFeS2 nanostructures are not-completely understood well to date since only few researchers studied the properties of CuFeS2 as follows: Layek et al. reported the application of CuFeS2 for organic–inorganic hybrid solar cells with MEH-PPV organic polymers.27 Later on Li et al. demonstrated the synthesis of CuFeS2 nanosheets with an average sheet thickness of less than 2.5 nm for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER).28 Similarly, Guo et al. synthesized CuFeS2 quantum dots (QDs) anchored in a carbon frame substrate which are used as a high capacity anode material for lithium ion batteries.29 Recently Deen et al. studied the energy-storage performance of CuFeS2 using a bed flow cell in a battery-like setup.23 These electrochemical analyses suggested that few more motivating studies are anticipated from CuFeS2 on the energy storage and conversion sectors which are needed to elucidate. Therefore, we aimed to examine the energy storage performance of CuFeS2 nanostructures as a supercapacitor electrode in this work. Herein, we synthesized CuFeS2 nanostructures via a hydrothermal method and examined their capacitive properties using a three-electrode configuration and symmetric supercapacitor design in an aqueous LiOH electrolyte.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Materials
Cupric chloride di-hydrate (CuCl2·2H2O), ferrous chloride tetra-hydrate (FeCl2·4H2O), thiourea (CH4N2S), N-methyl pyrrolidone (NMP), lithium hydroxide (LiOH), ethanol (C2H5OH) and acetone (C3H6O) were purchased from Daejung Chemicals Ltd, South Korea. Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) was bought from Sigma Aldrich, South Korea. Carbon black is acquired from Alfa Aesar, South Korea.
2.2 Synthesis of CuFeS2 nanostructures
CuFeS2 nanostructures were synthesized by a facile hydrothermal method. In a typical synthesis, 0.1 M of CuCl2·2H2O, 0.1 M of FeCl2·4H2O were dissolved in 70 mL of deionized water (DI) using an ultrasonication process. Then, 0.2 M of CH4N2S was added to the above precursor solution and kept under ultra-sonication for 1 h. The mixture was transferred to a 100 mL autoclave (Teflon lined stainless steel) and reacted at 200 °C for 12 h in an electric oven. After cooling the autoclave naturally, the obtained product was centrifuged and washed with distilled water and ethanol several times, and dried at 60 °C for overnight and then used for further characterization.
2.3 Instrumentation
The crystal phase of CuFeS2 was acquired using an Empyrean X-ray diffractometer (XRD) instrument (Malvern Panalytical, UK) equipped with a Cu-Kα radiation source (λ = 1.54184 Å) at a voltage of 40 kV and a current of 40 mA. The Raman spectrum of CuFeS2 was collected using a Lab Ram HR Evolution Raman spectrometer (Horiba Jobin–Yvon, France) at an excitation wavelength of 514 nm. The morphology of CuFeS2 was examined by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, TESCAN, MIRA3) coupled with an energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) analyzer. In order to obtain the surface composition of the as-synthesized CuFeS2, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed using an ESCA-2000, VG Microtech Ltd. The surface morphology of the CuFeS2 platelet was analyzed using a transmission emission scanning electron microscope (HR-TEM, JEOL JEM 2011, JEOL Ltd).
2.4 Electrochemical analysis
The fabrication of the working electrode is described in our previous work.30 Briefly, the active material (CuFeS2), carbon black and PVDF were mixed at a weight ratio of 75:20:5 using an N-methyl pyrrolidone (NMP) dispersant. The mixture was continuously ground for several hours to form a slurry using an agate-mortar. The slurry was then coated on a stainless-steel (MTI, South Korea) substrate and dried at 60 °C in an oven for 12 h. The mass loading of the active material on a stainless-steel substrate was approximately 1.5 mg, which was calculated from the difference between the mass of the substrate before and after coating using a Dual-range Semi-micro Balance (AUW-220D, SHIMADZU).
The electrochemical characterization of CuFeS2 was performed using the three-electrode system in an aqueous LiOH electrolyte (1.0 M), in which platinum served as the counter electrode, Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode and CuFeS2 coated stainless steel as the working electrode. The CuFeS2∥CuFeS2 symmetric supercapacitor device (SSD) was fabricated by sandwiching a polypropylene separator between two CuFeS2 coated stainless steel electrodes. All the electrochemical performances of the CuFeS2 electrode and CuFeS2∥CuFeS2 SSD were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge–discharge (CD), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) using an electrochemical workstation (AUTOLAB PGSTAT302N). The specific capacitance (Cs) of the CuFeS2 electrode and CuFeS2∥CuFeS2 SSD was calculated by CV and CD analysis using the following equation:31 (1) Cs = [(I × Δt)/(ΔV × m)](2)where “s” is the scan rate (mV s−1), “I” is the current (A), “ΔV” is the potential window, “m” is the active mass of the electrode (mg), and “Δt” is the discharge time (s).
The energy density (ED) and power density (PD) of the fabricated CuFeS2∥CuFeS2 SSD were calculated using the following relation:32 ED = 0.5 × Cs × ΔV2(3) PD = ED/Δt(4)where “Cs” is the specific capacitance of the CuFeS2 SSD, “ΔV” is the potential window of the CuFeS2∥CuFeS2 SSD and “Δt” is the discharge time (s) of the CuFeS2∥CuFeS2 SSD.
3. Results and discussion

Fig. 1 illustrates the schematic of the synthesis approach for the CuFeS2 nanostructure. During the hydrothermal reaction, CH4N2S reacts with CuCl2 and FeCl2 at high temperature and pressure. The CH4N2S reduces the Cu(II) and the following reaction occurred:23

Fig. 2(A) represents the XRD pattern of the CuFeS2 nanostructure. The diffraction peaks observed at 29.45°, 33.77°, 34.4°, 48.7°, 49.02°, 57.8°, 58.82°, 71.2°, 78.9°, and 79.6° are well matched to the (112), (200), (004), (220), (204), (312), (116), (400), (332) and (316) lattice planes of CuFeS2 (JCPDS no.: 37-0471), respectively. The XRD pattern represents the formation of pure CuFeS2 phase (no impurity phases such as Cu2S and FeS were detected) having a tetragonal crystal structure and belonging to the I2d space group.33 The Raman spectrum of CuFeS2 is presented in Fig. 2(B). There are four peaks observed in the frequency range of 200–600 cm−1. The Raman peaks observed at 292, and 354 cm−1 belong to stretching vibration of Fe–S bonds and peaks at 262, and 470 cm−1 correspond to the vibrational modes of Cu–S bonds. All the Raman peaks are well matched with the previous report.34,35 XPS analysis was performed to explore the surface chemical composition of CuFeS2, as displayed in Fig. 2(C–F). The existence of Cu 2p, Fe 2p, S 2p, C 1s and O 1s states of elements is verified from the survey spectrum in the range of 100–1200 eV, as shown in Fig. 2(C). The presence of element C (as reference) and O in the survey spectrum is due to the exposure to air.36 The peaks located (In Fig. 2(D)) at binding energy position of 932.58 eV and 952.53 eV are attributed to Cu+ 2p3/2 and Cu+ 2p1/2, respectively.37 The XPS spectrum of Fe 2p as provided in Fig. 2(E) shows two peaks at 711.97, and 724.63 eV which belong to the Fe3+ 2p3/2 and Fe3+ 2p1/2, respectively.38Fig. 2(F) shows the core level XPS spectrum for S 2p, in which peaks observed at 160.80, 162.01, and 163.4 eV are attributed to the S 2p3/2, S 2p1/2, and S2 2p1/2 (disulfide), respectively.28 FE-SEM micrographs of CuFeS2 nanostructures are shown in Fig. 3(A–C) and S1(A–C),† represents the platelet like an open-pored micro-flower. The sliced platelets have a uniform thickness and a clear gap between the platelets. These platelets irregularly interweaved with each other, and consequently assemble a hierarchically porous and interconnected network. This unique architecture can serve as an express highway for rapid ion diffusion and charge transfer for redox reactions. The elemental distribution of the as prepared CuFeS2 was elucidated using the energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) analyzer. The EDX spectrum of the CuFeS2 is shown in Fig. S2(A) (in the ESI†), where elements Cu, Fe, and S can be detected and the atomic percentage ratio of elements shows ∼1:1:2. The overlay elemental mapping of CuFeS2 using the EDX analyser is provided in Fig. S2(B) (in the ESI†). Fig. 3(D–F) represent the EDX mapping of CuFeS2, revealing the uniform distribution of Cu, Fe, and S elements on the surface of CuFeS2. The physical characterization and morphological analysis of CuFeS2 are well matched to the results described in the previously reported literature.23,33Fig. 4(A–C) show the HR-TEM micrographs of CuFeS2 with various levels of magnifications, which reveals the formation of platelet like morphology. The SAED pattern given in the inset of Fig. 4(C) represents the crystalline four diffraction rings which corresponds to the polycrystalline structure of the CuFeS2 platelet.39 The dimension of the platelet is ∼60–70 nm. To further clarify the distributions of Cu, Fe, and S elements in the CuFeS2 platelet, elemental mapping was performed during acquisition of the HR-TEM measurement. Fig. 4(D–F) show the elemental mapping of the CuFeS2 platelet, which represents the Cu, Fe and S elements homogenously distributed throughout the CuFeS2 platelet and the inset in Fig. 4(D) depicts the overlay HR-TEM micrograph for mapping of the CuFeS2 platelet. The evidence for the porosity of CuFeS2 from the HR-TEM micrograph is provided in Fig. S3 (in the ESI†).

The electrochemical performance of the CuFeS2 electrode was evaluated in a three-electrode measurement set-up using aqueous 1 M LiOH electrolyte. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) and charge–discharge (CD) profiles of the CuFeS2 electrode are provided in Fig. 5. A couple of explicit redox peaks are visible in the CV profile (Fig. 5(A)), implying that the capacitance of the CuFeS2 electrode is mainly governed by the faradaic mechanism. The shape of the CV profile of the CuFeS2 electrode displayed a typical faradaic influenced behavior which can be classified as a “Type B” CV curve in accordance with the recent editorial note contributed by Prof. Reginald M. Penner and Prof. Yuri Gogotsi.40 Moreover, the redox peaks can be retained at a high scan rate of 50 mV s−1, signifying the good rate capability of the prepared CuFeS2 electrode.41,42 With the increasing scan rates from 5 to 50 mV s−1, the CV curves of the CuFeS2 electrode show a minor potential shift between reduction and oxidation peaks. Fig. 5(B) shows the effect of scan rates on the specific capacity of the CuFeS2 electrode. The CuFeS2 electrode exhibits a maximum specific capacity of about 26.46 mA h g−1 (95.28 F g−1) at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1. The specific capacity of the CuFeS2 electrode is decreasing with an increase in the scan rate (5 to 50 mV s−1) which is due to the limited mass transport of electrolyte ions at the higher scan rates.43 The CuFeS2 electrode retains a specific capacity of about 35.44% of its initial capacity with an increase in the scan rate of 10-fold (50 mV s−1), which signifies the better rate capability of the CuFeS2 electrode.44

The CD measurements were performed to estimate the coulombic efficiency of the as-prepared CuFeS2 electrode at different applied currents in the potential window of −1.0 to 0.4 V, as shown in Fig. 5(C). The features of pseudocapacitance are further well supported by the nonlinear charge–discharge (CD) profile of the CuFeS2 electrode (in Fig. 5(C)). In addition, the charging–discharging profile of the CuFeS2 electrode is symmetric to each other, suggesting highly reversible redox reactions.45 The CuFeS2 electrode shows that the coulombic efficiency is about ∼100% for all the tested charge–discharge currents, which indicated its good electrochemical capacitive nature.46Fig. 5(D) represents the variation of specific capacity with respect to the current of the CuFeS2 electrode, which delivered a maximum specific capacity of about 29.40 mAh g−1 (75.62 F g−1) at a discharge current rate of 1 mA. The variation of specific capacitance with respect to different scan rates and currents is shown in Fig. S4 (in the ESI†). The electrochemical performance of the CuFeS2 electrode is compared with that of recently reported various electrodes and Cu and Fe based electrodes (in three-electrode system) are provided in Tables S1 and S2,† respectively. The attractive electrochemical performance of the CuFeS2 electrode is attributed to its unique structure and well-designed platelet like open pored micro-flower morphology, which facilitates more active redox sites for electrolyte ions.
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements have been performed to inspect the electrochemical behaviors of the CuFeS2 electrode in detail. The EIS measurement of the CuFeS2 electrode is provided in Fig. S5(A) (in the ESI†) using the Nyquist plot. The enlarged view of Nyquist discharge (Fig. S5(B)) (in the ESI†) of the CuFeS2 electrode shows the equivalent series resistance (ESR) smaller as ∼1.07 Ω, representing high conductivity. Besides, the radius of the semicircular arc of the CuFeS2 electrode belongs to the charge transfer resistance (Rct), which originates from electron transfer across the interface between the electrode and electrolyte.30 A Rct value of 10.37 Ω was found out from the Nyquist plot for the CuFeS2 electrode (shown in Fig. S5(B)) (in the ESI†). The cycling stability was recorded for the CuFeS2 electrode (Fig. S6(A)) (in the ESI†) at a discharge current rate of 5 mA, suggesting 94.38% capacitance retention over 2000 cycles. Fig. S6(B) (in the ESI†) represents the Nyquist plot for the CuFeS2 electrode before and after the cycling stability test. There is no significant change in the ESR value whereas the Rct increases from 10.37 Ω to 21.44 Ω after the cycling tests. This can be due to the obstruction of the electrolyte ion diffusion pathway during the continuous CD process and also due to loss of adhesion between the active materials and the current collectors during prolonged cycles which results in the gradual decay in the cycling performance of the CuFeS2 electrode.47–49
To evaluate the potential applications of the obtained CuFeS2 electrode as an energy-storage device, a CuFeS2∥CuFeS2 SSD (Fig. S7 (in the ESI†) schematic illustration of the CuFeS2∥CuFeS2 SSD) was fabricated and electrochemical analysis was performed in 1 M LiOH electrolyte in the potential range of 1 V (0.0 to 1.0 V).50 The CV profile of the CuFeS2∥CuFeS2 SSD at different scan rates 5–500 mV s−1 is shown in Fig. 6(A and B). The CV curves of the CuFeS2∥CuFeS2 SSD are almost quasi-rectangular and retained its shape with the increase in the scan rate (5–500 mV s−1), signifying the ideal capacitive nature.51Fig. 6(C) represents the variation of specific capacitance as a function of scan rates for the CuFeS2∥CuFeS2 SSD. The CuFeS2∥CuFeS2 SSD obtained the highest specific capacitance of about 35.90 F g−1 at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1. Additionally, the CuFeS2∥CuFeS2 SSD still holds a specific device capacitance of about 12.30 F g−1 and 6.83 F g−1 as the scan rate increased about 20 (100 mV s−1) and 100-times (500 mV s−1), signifying the good rate capability of the CuFeS2∥CuFeS2 SSD.52 To understand the charge-transfer mechanism and capacitive behavior of the CuFeS2∥CuFeS2 SSD EIS analysis was performed using the Nyquist and Bode plots. Fig. 6(D) represents the Nyquist plot of the CuFeS2∥CuFeS2 SSD. The Nyquist plot of the CuFeS2∥CuFeS2 SSD consists of low-frequency, intermediate-frequency, and high-frequency regions which correspond to the synchronous-charging, asynchronous-charging, and non-charging regions, respectively.4 In the Nyquist plot, the obtained slope (∼45°) is nearly parallel to the imaginary axis which is due to the Warburg impedance as a result of frequency-dependent fast ion diffusion kinetics of the electrolyte into the CuFeS2∥CuFeS2 SSD.53 The inset of Fig. 6(D) shows the enlarged view of the Nyquist plot in the low-frequency region, from which the equivalent series resistance (ESR), and charge-transfer resistance (Rct) are found to be 1.04 and 0.72 Ω, respectively for the CuFeS2∥CuFeS2 SSD. The plot of the phase angle as a function of applied frequency (Bode plot) for the CuFeS2∥CuFeS2 SSD is shown in Fig. S8(A) (in the ESI†). The Bode plot revealed that the phase angle of the CuFeS2∥CuFeS2 SSD tail in the low-frequency range is about −56.33°, which further confirms that the charge storage mechanism is due to the pseudocapacitive nature.31 The specific capacitance of the CuFeS2∥CuFeS2 SSD as a function of frequency is calculated from the impedance analysis employing the imaginary component of the impedance (as shown in Fig. S8(B) (in the ESI†)) using the following equation;54 Csp = −1/(2πƒZ′′m)(5)where “Csp” is the specific capacitance of the CuFeS2∥CuFeS2 SSD, “f” is the applied frequency in Hz, “Z′′” is the imaginary component of impedance, and “m” is the total mass of the CuFeS2∥CuFeS2 SSD. The estimated specific capacitance from the impedance analysis for the CuFeS2∥CuFeS2 SSD is about 30.82 F g−1, which is nearer to that of the specific capacitance obtained from CV and CD profiles.

Fig. 7(A) denotes the CD profiles of the CuFeS2∥CuFeS2 SSD recorded at various currents from 1 to 10 mA in the potential window of 1 V (0.0 to 1.0 V). The CD profile shows the non-linear charge–discharge curve and indicates the evidence of pseudocapacitive nature.55 The CD profiles of the CuFeS2∥CuFeS2 SSD show the coulombic efficiency is nearly 100% at different current rates. The effect of current on specific capacitances of the CuFeS2∥CuFeS2 SSD is shown in Fig. 7(B), which reveals that the specific capacitance decreases with the increase in current due to the time constraints of electrolyte ions.56 The estimated specific capacitance of the CuFeS2∥CuFeS2 SSD from the CD profile is about 34.18, 27.81, 24.35, 22.2, 19.16, 17.22, 15.18, 12.47 and 10.6 F g−1 at a current of 1.00, 1.50, 2.00, 2.50, 3.00, 4.00, 5.00, 7.50 and 10.0 mA respectively. Fig. 7(C) shows the Ragone plot for the CuFeS2∥CuFeS2 SSD to represent the energy density and power density of the device. The as-assembled CuFeS2∥CuFeS2 SSD delivers a maximum energy density of about 4.74 W h kg−1 at a power density of 166 W kg−1 (applied current of 1 mA), and still maintains an energy density of 1.47 W h kg−1 even at a maximum power density of 1666 W kg−1 (applied current of 10 mA). It is noteworthy that these are inspiring, much better than those of transition metal chalcogenides based SSD reported to date (Fig. 7(C) and Table S2†). In addition, the cycling stability performance is also a vital issue for supercapacitors. The cycling stability test (as shown in Fig. 7(D)) for the CuFeS2∥CuFeS2 SSD is performed at a current rate of 5 mA over 3000 cycles; the CuFeS2∥CuFeS2 SSD still retains 92.03% of the original capacitance after 3000 continuous charge–discharge cycles, demonstrating its remarkable cycling stability. To analyse the capacitance decay in the CuFeS2∥CuFeS2 SSD, we performed EIS measurement using the Nyquist plot and Bode plot before and after the cycling stability test (as shown in Fig. S9 and S10 (in the ESI†)). Fig. S9(A)† shows the Nyquist plot of the CuFeS2∥CuFeS2 SSD before and after the cycling stability test, in which the ESR value has been increased from 1.04 to 1.22 Ω (in the enlarged view as shown in Fig. S9(B)†).

Fig. S10(A)† represents the Bode phase angle plot of the CuFeS2∥CuFeS2 SSD before and after the cycling stability test, which revealed that the phase angle tail is reduced from −56.33° to −52.88°. The specific capacitance of the CuFeS2∥CuFeS2 SSD as a function of frequency (Fig. S10(B)†) is also decreased from 30.82 to 26.96 F g−1 after the cycling stability test, which might be the reason behind the observed small decay in capacitance.46 The FE-SEM micrographs of the CuFeS2 electrode before and after the cyclic stability tests are shown in Fig. S11 (in the ESI†)), which demonstrated that no structural changes occurred at the CuFeS2 electrode even after 3000 cycles of continuous charge–discharge measurement. This analysis suggested the structural robustness of the CuFeS2 electrode.57,58 The outstanding electrochemical performance of the CuFeS2 electrode can be attributed due to the unique platelet like open-pored micro-flower structure shortening the diffusion length of the electrons and ions, and the large-area material-electrolyte contact. These excellent electrochemical features of the CuFeS2∥CuFeS2 SSD indicate the potential of the CuFeS2 nanostructure for next generation energy storage devices.
4. Conclusion
In summary, the platelet like open-pored micro-flower structured pseudocapacitive material CuFeS2 is prepared through a hydrothermal method. The as prepared CuFeS2 exhibits excellent electrochemical performance with a high specific capacity of about 26.46 mA h g−1 (specific capacitance of about ∼95.28 F g−1) at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1. The fabricated symmetric supercapacitor device using the CuFeS2 electrode delivered a maximum specific capacitance of about 34.18 F g−1 at a discharge current rate of 1.00 mA and a maximum energy density of about 4.74 W h kg−1 at a power density of about 166 W kg−1 and outstanding cycling stability (about 92.03% capacitance retention over 3000 cycles at a discharge current rate of 5 mA). The excellent electrochemical performances are attributed to the highly accessible open-pored micro-flower structure. The unique platelet like open-pored micro-flower structure of CuFeS2 can be extended further to a wide range of applications, such as sensors, electronic devices, and energy conversion-storage devices.
