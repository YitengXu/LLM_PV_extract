    , Accepted 1st September 2020First published on 9th September 2020AbstractIn this study, new donor–acceptor (D–A) conjugated polymers based on 4-(4-((2-ethylhexyl)oxy)phenyl)-4H-dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole (EPDP) and 3,6-bis(5-bromothiophen-2-yl)-2,5-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-2,5-dihydropyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-dione (BTBP) or 4,7-bis(5-bromothiophen-2-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (BT) have been synthesized successfully via direct (hetero)arylation polymerization using Pd(OAc)2 and PCy3·HBF4 as a catalyst system. The obtained D–A conjugated polymers have been characterized via1H NMR, GPC, FTIR, DSC, XRD, PL and UV-Vis methods. Afterward, the D–A conjugated polymers have been applied for the fabrication of organic solar cells based on bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) structures.
1. Introduction
Today, organic solar cells (OSCs) have emerged as potential candidates as renewable energy resources because of their tremendous advantages.1–7 The power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of OSCs have enhanced up to 18% where conjugated copolymers as donor moieties combined with fullerene/non-fullerene derivatives as acceptors were applied in bulk-heterojunction structures.8–17 Among novel conjugated polymers, the type of alternating donor–acceptor (D–A) conjugated copolymers containing both electron donor and electron acceptor segments has exhibited extremely narrow bandgaps, red-shifts in absorption wavelength and excellent thermal stability. However, one of the main challenges in organic photovoltaics is the loss of energy in the photon absorption process and the optimal balance between the PCEs and open-circuit voltage (Voc) which influences the gap between the HOMO and LUMO levels in donor and acceptor materials.18 Hence, selecting appropriate donor and acceptor units in D–A materials plays a key role in handling these issues. Recently, conjugated polymers based on dithieno[3,2-b:2,3-d]pyrroles (DTPs) have shown favorable results, including reduced band gaps, high carrier mobilities, and stability in the oxidized state owing to the electron-rich N atom in their structure.19,20
Among strong electron–withdrawing units, benzothiadiazole (BT) and diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) have been used efficiently in D–A conjugated polymers for OSC and organic field-effect transistor (OFET) devices because of their planar and electron withdrawing structures.1,4,6 In 2013, Dou et al. reported the charge transport properties of a low band gap conjugated polymer named PBDTT-Se-DPP, which exhibited a PCE of 7.2% (Eg = 1.38 eV; JSC = 16.8 mA cm−2; VOC = 0.69 V).21 In 2014, Ashraf et al. reported the polymer PDPP2TT-T with PCE up to 8% (Eg = 1.39 eV; JSC = 23.5 mA cm−2; VOC = 0.57 V).22 Following this achievement, PDPP2TT-TT has been synthesized and explored with PCE reaching to 9.4% (Eg = 1.35 eV; JSC = 20.1 mA cm−2; VOC = 0.67 V) in 2015.23 On the other hand, a BT unit is also a favorable electron-withdrawing group with good π–π stacking, strong intermolecular interactions and simple synthesis procedure.24 In 2019, Chen et al. reported the polymers PE2:BTA3 and PE1:BTA3 with PCE of 5.83% (JSC = 8.06 mA cm−2; VOC = 1.26 V) and 8.43% (JSC = 11.95 mA cm−2; VOC = 1.11 V), respectively.25 The photovoltaic polymer PDPP2TzDTP based on DTP and BT was studied by Li et al. with a PCE of 5.6% (Eg = 1.67 eV; JSC = 14.9 mA cm−2; VOC = 0.69 V) in 2015 [10]. Geng et al. also reported the conjugated polymer PDTP-DT2BT with a PCE of 3.12% (Eg = 1.59 eV; JSC = 11.43 mA cm−2; VOC = 0.31 V, PCE = 3.12%).26 Nagarjuna et al. reported OSCs based on PTB7-Th polymer in combination with PC70BM and modified PC70BM (CN-PC70BM), with PCEs of 5.4% and 8.2%, respectively.27 Wan et al. also reported PTB7-Th:CN-PC70BM based OSCs with the structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PTB7-Th: PC61BM (1:1.5, w/w)/C60–N (16 nm)/Al, giving a PCE of 10.8% in the presence of 1.5% DIO + 1.5% NMP additives, whereas without additives only a PCE of 8.1% was obtained.28 This result suggested that the modification of acceptor moieties of PCBM and binary additives have an important role for incorporating donor and acceptor units for charge transport properties. On the other hand, conjugated polymers based on DTP moieties exhibit HOMO levels closed to that of PC60BM acceptor units as well as good stability in the oxidized state, which could be more promising for OSCs in comparison with PTB7-Th copolymer systems. However, there have not been any reports related to the synthesis and characterization of conjugated polymers based on DPP and 4,7-bis(5-bromothiophen-2-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole with 4-(4-((2-ethylhexyl)oxy)phenyl)-4H-dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole.
Therefore, in this research, the alternating D–A conjugated polymers poly[4-(4-((2-ethylhexyl)oxy)phenyl)-4H-dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole-alt-3,6-bis(5-bromothiophen-2-yl)-2,5-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4(2H)-dione] (P1) and poly[4-(4-((2-ethylhexyl)oxy)phenyl)-4H-dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole-alt-4,7-bis(5-bromothiophen-2-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole] (P2) have been designed and synthesized via direct (hetero)arylation polymerization using palladium(II) acetate (Pd(OAc)2) and tricyclohexylphosphine tetrafluoroborate (PCy3·HBF4) as a catalyst and ligand, respectively. The obtained novel conjugated polymers have been characterized via1H NMR, FT-IR, XRD, UV-Vis and photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopies as well as thermal analysis including differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Additionally, the organic solar cells based on these conjugated polymers have been fabricated and their PCEs have been evaluated.

Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra, collected as the average of 264 scans with a resolution of 4 cm−1, were recorded from a KBr disk on the FTIR Bruker Tensor 27. Size exclusion chromatography (SEC) measurements were performed on a Polymer PL-GPC 50 gel permeation chromatography (GPC) system equipped with an RI detector, with chloroform (CHCl3) and tetrahydrofuran (THF) as the eluent at a flow rate of 1.0 mL min−1. Molecular weights and molecular weight distributions were calculated with reference to polystyrene standards. Elemental analyses were performed by the Dumas combustion method, using a Costech ECS 4010 Elemental Analyzer.

2.9. Fabrication and characterization of a bulk-heterojunction polymer solar cell structure
First, the ITO substrates (10 Ω sq−1) were cleaned by ultrasonication with deionized water, acetone and isopropyl alcohol, respectively. The devices were fabricated with a bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) structure with a configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/conjugated polymer:PC61BM/Ca/Al. The film was annealed at 200 °C for 1 h, and then transferred into a N2-filled glove box to spin-cast the active layer. The solution containing a mixture of polymer:PC61BM (weight ratio is 1:1.5) in chlorobenzene solvent with 1.0 vol% of 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO). This was then followed by thermal annealing at 100 °C for 5 min. Then, Ca and Al were successively deposited by thermal evaporation in a vacuum less than 1 × 10−6 Torr with a deposition rate of 0.3 nm s−1.
2.10. Fabrication and characterization of OFETs
The polymers P1 and P2 were applied to fabricate OFETs on oxidized silicon wafers to determine the charge mobilities of the semiconducting polymers. 80 nm thick films of the P1 and P2 conjugated polymers were spin-coated on silicon wafer substrates under an argon environment, followed by film drying and annealing at 150 °C for 15 min. Finally, OFET devices were completed by evaporating gold source and drain contacts through a shadow mask. Keithley 4200 semiconductor parameter analyzer equipment was used to characterize the electrical properties of the OFET devices.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Synthesis and characterization of monomers and conjugated polymers
The synthetic route for preparation of 1-((2-ethylhexyl)oxy)-4-iodobenzene (compound 1, M1), 4H-dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole (M2) and 4-(4-((2-ethylhexyl)oxy)phenyl)-4H-dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole (M3) is presented in Scheme 1. M1 was synthesized by nucleophilic substitution, following the procedure of previous literature.30M2 was synthesized by Ullmann intramolecular cyclization reaction following a previous report.29 Then, monomer M3 was formed from M1 and M2via Buchwald–Hartwig cross coupling reaction where Pd(OAc)2, P(t-But)3 and NaOt-Bu were used as a catalyst and ligand, respectively. In the 1H NMR spectrum of monomer M3 (see Fig. S1, ESI†), the peaks at 7.04 ppm and 7.47 ppm are assigned for protons of “α” and “β” of the thiophene ring, while those at 7.08 ppm and 7.14 ppm correspond to the protons of the benzene ring linked with thiophene via a C–N linker. The peaks at 3.89 ppm and peaks from 0.8 ppm to 1.8 ppm are attributed to the alkyl chains of monomer M3. In addition, the integration of the peaks indicates that 4-(4-((2-ethylhexyl)oxy)phenyl)-4H-dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole (M3) was synthesized successfully.

At the early stage of the reaction, the color of the reaction was light yellow, and then changed to dark pink after 1 h and turned to dark blue after 24 h due to the synthesis of P1. In the case of P2, the color of the reaction changed to deep orange after 1 h and turned to dark purple after 24 h. Polymers P1 and P2 were dissolved in CHCl3 and filtrated via a Celite layer to eliminate the Pd catalyst, and then the polymers were obtained by precipitation in cold n-heptane. The yields of the polymerizations fluctuated between 60 and 70%. Moreover, the D–A copolymers exhibited good solubility in common organic solvents such as CHCl3, THF, dichlorobenzene and toluene. The gel permeation chromatography (GPC) results showed that the number average molecular weights (Mn) of P1 and P2 were 12700 g mol−1 and 14800 g mol−1 with polydispersity indexes (Đ) of 1.87 and 1.65, respectively. However, the GPC traces of the polymers exhibited unsymmetrical shape containing a shoulder in the range of low retention time, which was attributed to the high molecular weight fraction in the polymer mixture (Fig. 1). It should be noted that the D–A polymers were polymerized according to the step-growth polycondensation. Therefore, couplings of oligomer/polymer segments appeared to form extremely high molecular weight fractions compared to their average molecular weights.

The vibrational properties of polymers P1 and P2 were investigated by FTIR spectroscopy (see Fig. S2, ESI†). The FTIR spectra of P1 and P2 exhibited bands from 2853 cm−1 to 2922 cm−1 attributed to the C–H stretching mode of a hexyl group and C–H in an aromatic structure. The band from 1585 cm−1 to 1492 cm−1 is ascribed to the aromatic CC stretching and C–H deformation vibrations.31,32 The broad band between 1403 cm−1 and 1409 cm−1 is presented for the C–N stretching of pyrrole moieties. In addition, the characteristic band at 1658 cm−1 indicates the existence of the ketone CO group of the N-benzoyl dithieno [3,2-b:2′,3′-d] pyrrole moiety in the structure of polymer P1. The band from 577 to 824 cm−1 is ascribed to the C–S stretching vibrations of thiophene structures.
The structures of D–A polymers P1 and P2 were also investigated by 1H NMR spectroscopy. In the 1H NMR spectrum of P1 (Fig. 2A), the peaks from 0.80 to 1.90 ppm are attributed to the alkyl side chain of P1. The peak at 4.0 ppm corresponds to the methylene protons of the alkyl side chain (peak “d”, Fig. 2A). The multi-peaks from 6.5 ppm to 7.5 ppm (peaks “a”, “b”, “f” and “g”) correspond to the protons in thiophene, 4H-dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole and pyrrole aromatic structures. In addition, the broad peak at 8.98 ppm (peak “c”) is assigned as a characteristic peak of thiophene units. In the 1H NMR spectrum of P2 (Fig. 2B), the peaks from 0.80 ppm to 1.90 ppm are also ascribed to the alkyl side chains. The peaks at 2.69 ppm and 8.07 ppm correspond to the hexyl methylene protons, which is well-known for the 3-hexylthiophene unit. The peak at 4.0 ppm (peak “a”) is assigned to the methylene protons of the branched alkyl chain of M3 moieties. The peaks from 6.90 ppm to 8.07 ppm (peak “b”, “c”, “e”, “f”, and “g”) are characteristic for the protons in thiophene, 4H-dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole and benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole. Based on the GPC, FTIR and 1H NMR results, it can be demonstrated that D–A polymers P1 and P2 were obtained through direct heteroarylation polymerization. These polymers were also characterized via13C NMR spectroscopy. However, the results did not support clearly the determination of formation of polymers.

3.2. Optical and electrochemical properties of conjugated polymers
The absorption properties of polymers P1 and P2 were investigated through UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy, which was performed in dilute CHCl3 solution (ca. 10−6 mol L−1) and in solid state films. Polymer P2 showed an absorption maximum at 550 nm, whereas polymer P1 showed a strong red shift absorption maximum at 730 nm, which is 180 nm higher than for P2. This observation can be explained by the fact that normally the DPP unit has an absorption maximum above 650 nm. Thus, incorporation of DPP moieties in the D–A polymer structure led to a strong red shift in absorption. In addition, the main reason causing the absorption red shift of P1 is the strong intermolecular π–π stacking interactions between conjugated main chains, which enhances the rigidity in its structure. Fig. 3(b) presents the optical absorption spectra based on the solution-cast thin films of P1 and P2. The polymer P1 and P2 thin films exhibited absorption maxima at 800 nm and 680 nm, respectively. This phenomenon indicates again the strong intermolecular π–π stacking interactions of P1 in comparison with P2. Moreover, the λonset values of P1 and P2 were determined to be about 959 nm and 800 nm, corresponding to optical band gaps (Eoptg) of 1.31 eV and 1.55 eV, respectively. Furthermore, the molar extinction coefficients (ε) of P1 and P2 were 1.2 × 10−4 and 1.5 × 10−4, respectively. The parameters of the optical properties of D–A polymers are summarized in Table 1.

To investigate the photoluminescence (PL) of P1 and P2, the PL spectra of P1 and P2 were measured in different solvents as shown in Fig. 4. In CHCl3 and THF (ca. 10−3 mol L−1), P1 displayed an emission peak at 712 nm upon excitation at 450 nm, whereas P2 exhibited an emission peak at 735 nm upon excitation at 450 nm. The fluorescence quantum yields (ϕF) of D–A polymers in dilute CHCl3 were analyzed in comparison to 9,10-diphenylanthracene as a standard (ϕF = 0.9). The ϕF of P1 and P2 showed the same value of 0.43, likely indicating the strong π–π stacking effect in both polymer structures.33 The PL data are presented in Table 1.

The LUMO energy levels of the D–A polymers were determined from the optical band gaps which were calculated from onset absorption, while the HOMO energy levels are possibly estimated from cyclic voltammetry. Measurements of cyclic voltammetry for polymer P1 and P2 were calibrated against ferrocene, as an internal standard, of which the ionization potential value is −4.8 eV for the ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) redox system. The cyclic voltammetry curves and energy level diagrams of the D–A polymers are presented in Fig. 5. The oxidation onset potentials of P1 and P2 were 0.8 and 1.1 eV, corresponding to the HOMO energy levels of −5.2 eV and −5.5 eV, respectively. The LUMO energy levels of P1 and P2 calculated from the values of the optical band gaps and HOMO energy levels were −3.89 and −3.95 eV, respectively. It is very clear that the LUMO levels of P1 and P2 are close to that of the PCBM acceptor, suggesting that the polymers are useful for the preparation of photovoltaic cells.

3.3. Thermal and solid state properties of the conjugated polymers
The thermal properties of polymers P1 and P2 were characterized by TGA and DSC. TGA analysis was performed under nitrogen flow to determine the stability of these D–A polymers in the range from room temperature to 950 °C. The polymer P2 exhibited a good thermal stability with a decomposition temperature (5% weight loss) above 350 °C, whereas polymer P1 showed a lower thermal stability with a decomposition temperature (5% weight loss) around 250 °C (see Fig. 6(a)). The second heating run DSC diagrams in the range from room temperature to 300 °C of the D–A polymers are presented in Fig. 6(b). No melting transition in this temperature range was detected for both P1 and P2 polymers. Normally, the main chain of conjugated polymers is very stiff due to their strong intermolecular π–π stacking interaction, which results in high melting temperatures above 200 °C.34–36

The molecular ordering of these D–A conjugated polymers in the solid state was characterized through powder XRD measurements (Fig. 7). Polymer P1 exhibited several distinctive crystalline diffractions at 2θ = 18° (4.9 Å), 28° (3.2 Å) and 40° (2.3 Å), which closely correspond to the conjugated main chain distance, π–π stacking spacing and distance between highly stacked hetero-aromatic rings, repectively,37,38 while the broad halo centered at 23° is likely attributed to side chain disorder. On the other hand, for polymer P2, the XRD pattern showed two broad diffractions at ca. 23 and 39° and diffractions associated to strong stacking orientation seem absent (or maybe overlaid by the amorphous scattering halo). This suggests that P2 more weakly aggregates than P1.
 Fig. 7  XRD patterns of polymer P1 (a) and P2 (b). 
The microscopic and nanoscopic morphologies of thin films of D–A polymers were checked by AFM in a tapping contact mode. The drop-casting technique was applied to prepare thin films onto the wafer substrates from a good solvent. Fig. 8 shows the AFM images of polymers P1 and P2 after solvent annealing at 150 °C. These results revealed that the surface of polymer P1 was smoother than that of P2. The roughness value of P1 was determined as 0.49, whereas P2 exhibited a roughness value of 2.11.

The polymers P1 and P2 were further applied to fabricate OFETs on oxidized silicon wafers to determine the charge mobilities of the semiconducting polymers.
Thin film transistors based on P1 and P2 conjugated polymers exhibited typical p-channel output characteristics due to the plot of drain current IDvs. drain voltage at different gate voltages (VG) (Fig. 9). The mobilities of OFET devices have been calculated according to the linear regime theory at low drain voltage following eqn (1)39,40 (1)where μh is the field-effect mobility of holes, W is the channel width, L is the channel length, and the channel length and width of the transistor are 10 μm and 700 μm respectively. The Ci is the capacitance per unit area of the gate dielectric layer (SiO2, 300 nm. Ci = 11 nF cm−2). VG, VT and VD are gate, threshold and drain voltages, respectively. The thin film transistors based on P1 and P2 conjugated polymers exhibited hole mobilities of 1.98 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 9.54 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 with an on/off ratio of about 105 and 103, respectively. This result suggested that the synthesized conjugated polymers are promising for organic solar cell applications.

As shown in Fig. 10, the AFM images of the P2:PC61BM blended film showed a rough surface, with an RMS of 2.18 nm, which inhibited charge migration and exciton diffusion. In contrast, the AFM image of the P1 and PC61 BM blended film shows much finer domains, with an RMS of 0.62 nm, which resulted in a much higher fill factor.

3.4. Organic solar cell device fabrication
Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells were fabricated following the conventional structure ITO/PEDOT:PSS/conjugated polymer:PC61BM/Ca/Al.41 The JSC, VOC, fill factor (FF) and PCE values of the OSCs based on a BHJ structure of polymer P1 and polymer P2 are presented in Table 2. The OSCs based on P1 and P2 exhibited the same VOC of 0.79 V. This suggested that the VOC of OSCs is not completely reflected by the HOMO level of conjugated polymers, since the VOC of cells much depends on the interaction of the electrode and activated layers as well as the parameters of the cell fabrication process. The bilayer structure solar cells based on P1 and P2 showed an average PCE of 4.85% and 3.99%, respectively. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the polymer solar cell devices recorded under AM 1.5 illumination with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2 are plotted in Fig. 11A. The EQE spectra of these devices exhibited a pronounced contribution to photocurrent generation in the wavelength range of 400–850 nm (Fig. 11B). This implies that the transport of generated charges from the P1(P2)/PC61BM interface to the anode layer via the PC61BM electron channels was quite effective, which contributes to the relatively good device performance. On the other hand, the device fabricated from P1 reveals better EQE values than that of P2. This might be attributed to either less effective contact interface between P2 and PC61BM or to less efficient charge transport in polymer P2. It should be noted that the PCE depends not only on the bandgap but also on the charge-carrier mobility. Therefore, the photovoltaic parameters of the BHJ solar cells fabricated from polymer P1 with the PC61BM acceptor compound revealed that the PCE of P1 (4.85%) was much better than that of polymer P2 (3.99%) as a result of the lower bandgap energy level and higher ordering structure of P1 giving rise to more efficient charge transport.

4. Conclusions
In conclusion, newly designed D–A conjugated polymers based on 4-(4-((2-ethylhexyl)oxy)phenyl)-4H-dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole (EPDP) and 3,6-bis(5-bromothiophen-2-yl)-2,5-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-2,5-dihydropyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-dione (BTBP) or 4,7-bis(5-bromothiophen-2-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (BT) units were synthesized successfully in 65–69% yields through direct(hetero)arylation polymerization. The D–A polymers P1 and P2 were characterized, exhibiting low bandgap energy levels of 1.31 eV and 1.55 eV, respectively. Both polymers P1 and P2 were used to fabricate BHJ organic solar cells in combination with PC61BM with PCEs of 4.85% and 3.99%, respectively. This work demonstrated the potential of new D–A conjugated polymers to achieve efficient organic photovoltaic devices.
