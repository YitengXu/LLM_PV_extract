    , Accepted 31st March 2023First published on 4th April 2023AbstractThe power conversion efficiency (PCE) of polymer solar cells (PSCs) has recently reached >19% through the development of photoactive materials, particularly non-fullerene acceptors. Interfacial layers (ILs) have been another essential factor in optimizing device charge extraction. In this study, we propose a series of ILs, in which ionic iridium(III) (Ir(III)) complexes of different alkali metal cations (Li+, Na+, and K+) enhance the charge collection efficiency between zinc oxide and active layers through an induced internal electric field. The anionic coordinate sphere and counter-cations of the Ir(III) complexes are distributed according to the operating voltage of the PSCs, causing electric dipoles that enhance the internal electric field and charge collection efficiency. Ion species migration in the ILs is confirmed using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The PCE of the PM6:Y6-based PSCs was improved from 14.0% to 15.6% by introducing an IL (Ir–K+). Furthermore, the stability of PSCs containing ionic Ir(III) complexes is enhanced significantly under ultraviolet (UV) light and AM 1.5 G one-sun irradiation owing to the intense UV absorption capacity and photo durability of the ILs. A device containing the Ir(III) complex-based ILs retained ∼60% of its initial PCE after UV irradiation, whereas the control device retained only ∼20%.
1. Introduction
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) have attracted considerable attention as zero-carbon energy generators owing to their low weight, flexibility, and large surface area. For commercialization, researchers have focused on the sunlight harvesting efficiency by broadening the absorption range of the active layer and controlling its morphology using additives, thereby increasing the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of such cells in recent decades.1–4 Despite these improvements, PSCs are characterized by considerable energy losses in charge transport and collection due to the intrinsic energy barrier between the active layer and the charge transport layers, or electrodes. Thus, understanding the mechanism by which the charge extraction barrier is reduced by functional interfacial layers (ILs) is crucial for improving PSC performance.
One promising approach for overcoming this issue is to apply an electric dipole layer. Conjugated polyelectrolytes (CPEs) are a typical and successful example that has been widely used and has led to significant improvements in device performance.5–8 The CPEs can have induced dipole moments that align with the electric field; thus, under short-circuit conditions, an IL has a dipole moment directed toward the electrode side owing to the built-in electric field between the electrodes, which increases the work function of the electrode.9,10 However, a complicated synthesis process and poor batch-to-batch reproducibility for the polymer restrict the application of CPEs. Compared with CPE-based IL materials, ionic transition metal complexes (iTMCs) have several specific advantages, including simple synthesis and purification methods, precise molecular weights and well-defined structures, a lack of end-group contaminants, and better batch-to-batch reproducibility.11,12 The ionic properties of iTMCs induce good solubility of orthogonal solvents on the active layer in PSCs and can deposit an active layer on the ILs without damage. In addition, iTMCs have an advantage in energy level alignment. iTMCs can be completely separated into a coordinate sphere and counterion parts (Fig. 1a). Therefore, each ionic part can migrate to the opposite surface of the IL under a bias. The redistribution of ionic parts can lead to a strong interfacial dipole and an energy level alignment, which results in intensive charge carrier collection.13,14 In contrast, the polymer backbone in CPEs is inseparable, and only counter-ions migrate along the ILs; the separation of charges is relatively restricted (Fig. 1b).15 Therefore, the strategic development of iTMCs for ILs is an efficient approach for enhancing charge collection in PSCs.

In addition, device stability is a major challenge for the wide commercialization of PSCs.16–19 An ideal PSC is expected to maintain constant performance, even under varying environmental conditions (e.g., from light to dark, hot to cold, or dry to humid). Of these environmental changes, light stability remains particularly challenging, as physical protection (e.g., encapsulation) is an inadequate remedy. Therefore, limiting exposure to ultraviolet (UV)-violet light, which can decompose the photoactive layer, is critical for PSC stability.
In this study, we designed and synthesized iridium (Ir) metal-based iTMCs that utilize Ir(III) complexes of varying cation sizes, including lithium (Ir–Li+), sodium (Ir–Na+), and potassium (Ir–K+) cations. The designed Ir(III) complexes were then applied to PSC devices as ILs with polyethylene oxide (PEO) (the PEO matrix improves the ionic mobility of an Ir(III) complex in the solid state20,21) to modulate the interfacial dipole. The PSC devices contained a transparent indium tin oxide (ITO) electrode, molybdenum oxide (MoO3) as a hole-transport layer, an active layer (PTB7-Th:PC71BM), zinc oxide (ZnO) as an electron transport layer, and silver (Ag) as the metal electrodes. The device performance of the Ir(III) complex-based ILs exhibited enhancement in the order of Ir–K+ > Ir–Na+ > Ir–Li+, which was corroborated using space charge limited current (SCLC) measurements for electron mobility and photocurrent density as a function of the effective applied voltage (Jph–Veff) measurements for charge collection. To confirm the electric dipole formation effect of the Ir(III) complex-ILs, ion migration and accumulation were confirmed using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Various donors (PTB7, PTB7-Th, PBDTTPD-HT, and PBDBT-2F) and acceptors (PC71BM, IEICO-4F, ITIC, and Y6) were used as light-absorbing materials to confirm the versatility of the Ir–K+: the best-performing material, the PBDBT-2F:Y6 blend, enhanced the PCE from 14.0% to 15.6%. In addition, a device containing the Ir(III) complex exhibited greater photostability compared to a control device owing to its higher UV light absorption capacity. After UV irradiation for 48 h, the device containing the Ir(III) complex retained ∼60% of its initial PCE, whereas the control device retained only ∼20%. After 108 h under 1 sun simulated sunlight (air mass 1.5 global; AM 1.5 G), the device with the Ir(III) complex retained ∼70% of its initial PCE, whereas the control device retained <10%. The results highlight a potential method for simultaneously enhancing the stability and efficiency of PSC devices.
2. Results and discussion
2.1. Synthesis and characterization of Ir(III) complexes
The synthesis of the Ir(III) complexes used in this study is illustrated in Fig. 2. The intermediates 1–4 in the syntheses of the Ir(III) complexes were prepared using previously reported methods.22 The final Ir(III) complexes were obtained by reacting intermediate 4 with lithium hydroxide (LiOH), sodium hydroxide (NaOH), and potassium hydroxide (KOH) in methanol. The details of the synthesis and characterization are provided in the ESI† (Fig. S1–S11 and Tables S1–S2). The photophysical properties of the Ir(III) complexes are presented In Fig. S12 and Table S3 (ESI†). The absorption spectrum of the compound in 2-methyltetrahydrofuran exhibited an intense band between 300 and 400 nm in the UV region. These bands are assigned to the spin-allowed π–π* ligand-centered transitions in 2-phenylquinoline ligands. Conversely, the low energy absorption features observed at approximately 450 nm can be attributed to spin-forbidden metal-to-ligand charge transfer.

2.2. Application of Ir(III) complex-ILs in PSCs
Initially, we tested the suitability of Ir(III) complexes as ILs. The crystallinity of ZnO and the active layer was investigated after introducing the Ir(III) complex-ILs. X-Ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were performed to evaluate the surface crystallinity of the ZnO after Ir(III) complex-based ILs deposition. The XRD spectra (Fig. S13, ESI†) exhibited peaks at 30.3°, 35.2°, and 37.8°, which correspond to the (100), (002), and (101) planes of the ZnO crystal. These data confirm that the formation of the Ir(III) complex layer did not affect the crystallinity of a coated ZnO layer.23 The effects of the Ir(III) complex-based ILs on the crystallinity of the bulk-heterojunction system were also investigated using grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray diffraction (GI-WAXD). In the 2D GI-WAXD image of the PTB7-Th:PC71BM film, three typical PC71BM peaks (at q = 0.72, 1.32, and 1.98 Å−1), the (100) diffraction peak (at qxy = 0.32Å−1), and the (010) diffraction peak associated with the π–π stacking of the polymer were observed (Fig. S14, ESI†).24,25 All diffraction peaks of the PTB7-Th:PC71BM blend were retained after inserting the Ir(III) complex-ILs between the ZnO and PTB7-Th:PC71BM layers. Therefore, the Ir(III) complex did not produce changes in the nanoscale morphology of the active layer films.
Three Ir(III) complexes (Ir–Li+, Ir–Na+, and Ir–K+) were applied as ILs in the PSCs. The molecular structures of the active materials are shown in Fig. 3a, and the device structure and energy diagram are shown in Fig. 3b. The current density–voltage (J–V) responses of the PSC devices as a function of the counter-cations of the Ir(III) complexes are shown in Fig. 4a. The detailed device parameters are provided in Table 1. The control device (PTB7-Th:PC71BM) without an Ir(III) complex demonstrated a PCE of 8.1%. In contrast, the devices with Ir(III) complex-based ILs exhibited PCEs of 8.9% (Ir–Li+), 9.3% (Ir–Na+), and 9.5% (Ir–K+). The relatively higher JSC values for the devices with Ir(III) complex-based ILs can be ascribed to efficient charge collection resulting from electric dipole formation (Fig. 4b). Furthermore, the Ir–K+-based ILs were employed in conjunction with different active materials (PTB7:PC71BM, PTB7-Th:PC71BM:IEICO-4F, PBDTTPD-HT:ITIC:PC71BM, and PBDBT-2F:Y6 blend), and the maximum PCE of the device improved from 14.0% to 15.6% after introducing the Ir–K+-based ILs into the PBDBT-2F:Y6 blend (Fig. S15, S16 and Table S4, ESI†). These results demonstrate the high molecular compatibility and potential use of Ir(III) complex-ILs with diverse active materials.

2.3. Charge carrier characteristics of PSCs with Ir(III) complexes
To investigate the effects of the Ir(II) complex-ILs, we also measured the electron mobility of the electron-only device structure of the ITO/ZnO/Ir(III) complexes (Ir–Li+, Ir–Na+, and Ir–K+):PEO/PTB7-Th:PC71BM/LiF/Al using the SCLC method (Fig. 4c). The electron mobility was determined using the Mott–Gurney SCLC formula as follows:26,27 (1)where εε0 is the permittivity of the polymer, μ is the carrier mobility, and L is the device thickness. All devices with Ir(III) complex-based ILs exhibited enhanced electron mobilities (Ir–Li+, Ir–Na+, and Ir–K+ exhibited values of 1.48, 2.05, and 3.20 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively), and the most efficient device – that with the ZnO/Ir–K+ layer – achieved 6-fold greater electron mobility compared to the device without Ir(III) complex-ILs (0.58 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1). Based on this result, incorporating the Ir(III) complex-ILs facilitated more efficient electron collection between the ZnO and the photoactive layer. These results are in good agreement with the device performance analyses. To further investigate the charge collection properties of the Ir–K+-based ILs, the Jph was analyzed as a function of the Veff (Fig. 4d).28,29Jph represents the current density difference between Jl (in the light) and Jd (in the dark). The Veff was calculated as Veff = V0 − Vapp, where V0 is the voltage at Jph = 0 and Vapp is the applied bias. The exciton dissociation probability (Pdiss) can be defined by the ratio of Jph/Jsat under short-circuit conditions, where Jsat is saturation Jph when Veff is 2.5 V. The charge collection probability (Pcoll) can be determined by the ratio of Jph/Jsat under maximum power output conditions. The device with Ir–K+ ILs exhibited a higher Pcoll (84.8%) than that of the control device (Pcoll of 80.2%). Devices with Ir–Na+ and Ir–Li+ ILs exhibited Pcoll values of 84.1% and 81.2%, respectively. The enhancement of charge collection probability supports the improvement of JSC in the device with Ir(III) complexes.
2.4. Ion migration and distribution in interlayer
Interestingly, the device performance exhibited distinct trends according to the counter-cation size (K+ > Na+ > Li+) after introducing the Ir(III) complex-based ILs. This phenomenon can be explained by the differences in surface charge accumulation at the interfaces according to the cation size. In this study, we use PEO as a matrix and electrolyte channel in the Ir(III) complex-ILs (Fig. 4e). In the PEO channel, cations are present in the form of solvated ions that are stabilized by the oxygen molecules of the PEO backbone. Cations surrounded by oxygen molecules form a spherical shell called a solvation shell. The radius of the solvation shell is inversely proportional to the original size of the ion, as small ions have more solvation energy and can accept more oxygen molecules (Fig. 4f).30 Potassium ions have a relatively large ion size, but are weakly solvated, with a small solvation shell. However, the smaller lithium ion can be solvated more strongly, leading to a large solvation radius (Fig. 4e). For this reason, we predict that K+ will exhibit the highest surface charge accumulation on the surface of the active layer, followed by Na+ and Li+.
To further investigate the performance enhancement by ion migration instead of surface passivation, the capacitance charge was investigated using EIS. First, we analyzed the interfacial polarization caused by ion migration through EIS measurements in asymmetric cells (ITO/ZnO/Ir–K+:PEO/Ag), as shown in Fig. 5a. The impedance responses (Z′ and Z′′ are the real and imaginary parts of the impedance, respectively) were then converted to dielectric permittivity values (ε*(ω) = ε′ − jε′′, where ε′ and ε′′ are the real and imaginary parts, respectively), as expressed in the following equations:31,32 (2) (3) (4)where ω is the angular frequency (2πf), C0 is the vacuum capacitance, ε0 is the free space permittivity (8.854 × 10−12 F m−1), A is the area of the electrode, and t is the thickness of the IL film. Fig. 5b shows that the ε′ of the Ir(III) complex layer increased significantly in the low-frequency region when a pre-bias of –2 V was applied to the corresponding asymmetric cell. The applied potential acted as the internal potential for the PSC under AM 1.5 G 1 sun illumination. These results imply that the accumulation of the charged species occurs at the interface between the Ir(III) complex layer and the electrode (i.e., the interfacial polarization). Similarly, high ε′′ was also observed in the low-frequency region (Fig. 5c), which reflects the enhanced ion mobility in the PEO matrix. However, in the absence of the Ir(III) complexes in the PEO matrix (PEO only), the ε′ and ε′′ did not increase in the same frequency region following the pre-bias treatment of the corresponding asymmetric cell, owing to the absence of ions in the PEO matrix. These bias-dependent results imply that the capacitance charge on interface is caused by ion migration during light exposure. This bias-dependent property of the Ir(III) complex layer clearly differs from the effect of surface passivation.

Plots of (b) the real (ε′) and (c) imaginary (ε′′) parts of the dielectric permittivity of the asymmetric cell as a function of angular frequency (ω). 
2.5. Stability analysis
The light absorption process in films containing an Ir–K+ layer is illustrated in Fig. 6a. We expected the Ir(III) complexes to enhance the photostability of the photoactive layer because of its strong UV light absorption characteristics. To confirm this, film transmittance, device performance, and GI-WAXD analyses were performed as a function of the aging time. The transmittance spectrum of the ZnO/Ir–K+ film exhibited reduced transmission in the UV region. In contrast, its transmission in the visible light region was comparable to that of the film containing only ZnO (Fig. 6b). These results indicate that the Ir(III) complex layers can reduce the UV light-induced degradation of the photoactive layer by absorbing UV light without inhibiting visible light absorption.

The aged devices were exposed to UV light in air for 48 h before testing. 
The stability of the PTB7-Th:PC71BM device with an Ir–K+ layer was investigated under constant UV irradiation through the ITO side. The device with the Ir–K+ layer retained ∼60% of its initial PCE after 48 h of irradiation, whereas the control device retained only ∼20% (Fig. 6c). Similar results were obtained for the other (Ir–Li+ and Ir–Na+) ILs (Fig. S17, ESI†). Furthermore, we measured the long-term stability of the devices under AM 1.5 G 1 sun illumination. The results confirmed that the device with the Ir–K+ layer had a higher efficiency retention compared to the control device after long-term stability testing (Fig. 6d). The device with the Ir–K+ layer retained ∼70% of its original value after 108 h under AM 1.5 G 1 sun irradiation. Conversely, for the device prepared without an Ir(III) complex layer, the PCE decreased to <10% of its original value after illumination. The long-term stability test demonstrates that PSCs with Ir(III) complex-based ILs were more stable than those without an Ir(III) complex-based IL when subjected to UV and AM 1.5 G 1 sun irradiation. We also used X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) depth profiling to examine the ions in the aged active layer (AM 1.5 G 1 sun illumination for 108 h) to assess ion penetration (Fig. S18, ESI†). The results indicate that ion concentrations exist only in an area of the IL, indicating that the metal ions do not penetrate the active layer from the ILs. Finally, we investigated the changes in the crystallinity of the photoactive layer using GI-WAXD measurements. The UV-aged 2D GI-WAXD images show that the morphology of the PTB7-Th:PC71BM film without an Ir–K+ layer was severely degraded compared with the film containing an Ir–K+ layer (Fig. 6e–h). Similar results were obtained for the Ir–Li+ and Ir–Na+ layers (Fig. S19, ESI†). The peak changes also indicate that the crystallinity of the PTB7-Th:PC71BM blend film degraded during the UV light irradiation and that the introduction of an Ir–K+ layer prevented such degradation.
3. Conclusions
In this study, Ir(III) complexes with alkali metal cations (Li+, Na+, and K+) were synthesized for application as efficient charge collection layers in PSCs. The performance of PSCs with various active materials that contained the Ir(III) complex-ILs (Ir–K+) improved by 10–20%, and the best performance was 15.6% of PCE for the PBDBT-2F:Y6 blend, which can be attributed to enhanced surface charge accumulation and electric dipoles that acted as an additional driving force for charge collection. The charge accumulation was confirmed by EIS analyses of the bias-dependent polarization property. Furthermore, the devices containing Ir(III) complex-based ILs also exhibited enhanced photostability owing to the strong UV light absorption capacity of the Ir(III) complex. These results demonstrate that both the stability and efficiency of PSC devices can be enhanced using an ionic IL. In addition, both the stability and efficiency of PSC devices can be enhanced using ionic Ir(III) complex-based ILs, and we expect that this method will open up new opportunities for the design and application of ILs for PSCs.

The device performance of the PSCs devices was measured in ambient air with encapsulation process, through a digital source meter (Series 2635A, Keithley Instruments, Inc.) instrument under simulated AM 1.5 G radiation (100 mW cm−2) using a xenon arc lamp, and SCLC measurement was conducted under dark from −3 V to 3 V range. IPCE measurement was conducted by an EQE system (Model QEX7, PV Measurements Inc.) in the AC mode in the dark. Ion penetration of device was measured by XPS depth profiler (K-alpha, ThermoFisher).
4.8. Morphology characterization
AFM images were obtained using a Multimode V (Bruker) instrument in tapping mode over a 1 mm × 1 mm scan area XRD measurement was conducted with coated films with High Resolution XRD (D8 Advance). GI-WAXD measurement was carried out at the PLS-II 6D UNIST-PAL beamline of Pohang Accelerator Laboratory in Korea. The X-ray coming from the bending magnet was monochromated (λ = 1.06 Å) using a double crystal monochromator (DCM), and focused using a sagittal focusing DCM and bendable toroidal mirror system (beam size: 150 μm (H) × 120 μm (V) in FWHM @ sample position). The 2D GI-WAXD measurement system was equipped with a 6-axis motorized sample stage inside a vacuum chamber (∼2 × 10−2 torr), so as to enable the fine alignment of a thin film sample and effective removal of unwanted air and window scattering. 2D GI-WAXD patterns were recorded with a 2D CCD detector (Rayonix MX225-HS, USA) and diffraction angles were calibrated by a pre-calibrated sucrose sample (monoclinic, P21, a = 10.8631 Å, b = 8.7044 Å, c = 7.7624 Å, and β = 102.938°).
4.9. Impedance spectroscopic analyses
The asymmetric cell (ITO/ZnO/Ir(III) complex:PEO or PEO only/Ag) was prepared to perform the impedance spectroscopy measurement. It would be noteworthy that 5 times higher concentrated ILs solution compared to the original concentration was used to fabricate enough thick Ir(III) complex ILs film to prevent short-circuit of the asymmetric cell. Nyquist plot was obtained using a computer-controlled electrochemical analysis system (combined 1287A Potentiostat and 1260A Impedance/Gain-phase analyzer, Solartron Analytical, AMETEK, Inc.). The frequency range of 106 to 0.1 Hz was employed together with AC amplitude of 30 mV at open circuit potential.
