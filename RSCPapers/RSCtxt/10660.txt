    , Accepted 13th August 2022First published on 16th August 2022AbstractThe acceptor–donor–acceptor structured fused-ring electron acceptors (FREAs) have piqued interest for organic solar cells. We herein employ time-dependent density functional theory to evaluate the effect of Hartree–Fock exact exchange (HFX) on the performance of 16 global hybrid functionals for computing the maximum absorption wavelengths (λver-theo) and the vertical excitation energies (Ever-theo) of 34 molecules. We customize the HFX ratio in the functionals used to perform an in-depth analysis of its impact on the Ever-theo values. The computed λver-theo values strictly follow an inverse proportionality to the HFX percentage. The performance of the methods with the same ratio of HFX is almost identical, such as B3LYP, B3PW91, and mPW3PBE containing 20% HFX. The performance enhances with a relatively higher HFX ratio of 21% in X3LYP, B971, B972, and 22% in B98 giving smaller deviations. APF and APFD containing 23% HFX provide the smallest deviations for all compounds, with a mean signed error limited to 0.02 eV and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.06 eV. The performance drops using M06 and M05 with comparatively higher HFX ratios providing MAE values of 0.07 eV and 0.1 eV, respectively. M06-2X with 54% HFX provides the largest MAE value of 0.35 eV. The lowest obtained MAE is 0.06 eV at 23 to 25% HFX in most of the functionals considered in this study, suggesting that these are the optimal values for the prediction of excitation energies of FREAs. It has also been found that global hybrids seem to be more efficient for larger-sized molecules with a smaller bandgap.
1 Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) with the bulk-heterojunction blend of non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) and donor polymers as active layers have been the foundation of significant inventions because the NFA-based devices outperformed the fullerene counterparts in terms of efficiency, flexibility, stability, light weight, and easy synthesis and solution processing.1–3 The donor:acceptor blend crammed between two electrodes absorbs solar photons to produce excitons, which subsequently divide into free electrons and holes at the acceptor:donor interface and then drift in opposite directions towards the corresponding electrodes. Among the NFA family, the acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) structured fused-ring electron acceptors (FREAs) have made marvelous development due to their versatile structure alteration to attain excellent absorption of sunlight and tunable energy levels.4,5 The magnificent design and continuing progress of A–D–A FREAs have pushed the power conversion efficiencies for OSCs up to 19%.6,7
FREAs have low reorganization energy and robust electron accepting properties for a single electron reduction.8 They are the lower bandgap components in the active layer of OSCs to assist in capturing solar photons in the visible and near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths, whereas the fullerene acceptors have a broader bandgap. The strong NIR absorption, lower exciton binding energy and boosted optical cavity effects hence endow FREAs with high extinction coefficients and refractive indices.9,10 Due to superior NIR sunlight harvesting, FREAs generate higher open-circuit voltage values than fullerene-based acceptors. Extensive experimental and theoretical efforts are being made to push the OSC performance limit to those of solar cells based on inorganic semiconductors. Compared to the experimental trial and error procedures, simulation saves time and resources in the design and fine-tuning of the optoelectronic characteristics of photovoltaic materials to achieve the optimal efficiency in OSCs. Therefore, the performance of the theoretical approach adopted for specific features of certain materials is crucial.
Calculations employing density functional theory (DFT) and linear-response time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) yield transition energies at comparatively low computing costs. TD-DFT has thus become an established approach for exploring the electronic excited states of big organic molecules. The excited state interpretation assists in studying the exciton and charge generation, transport, and charge-recombination processes in OSCs. Importantly, the TD-DFT framework can take the solvent effects into account for the excited state simulations of organic photovoltaic (OPV) materials. Numerous DFT functionals have been formulated and categorized into different sets, such as local-spin-density approximation (LSDA), generalized-gradient approximation (GGA), meta-GGAs (mGGAs), global hybrids (GHs), range-separated hybrids (RSHs), and double-hybrid functionals.11,12 However, various functionals provide a poor depiction of Rydberg and charge transfer excitations, dropping the accuracy of computed transition energies for large molecules. Based on the comparatively better performance of GHs, i.e., B3LYP13–15 and PBE0 (PBE1PBE)16,17 than LC-ωPBE, CAM-B3LYP, and PBE for the nature and energies of the excited states of A–D–A FREAs in our previous studies,18,19 we further explore the performance of GHs for FREAs by extending the functional set with a varying ratio of non-local Hartree–Fock exchange (HFX). The PBE0 technique outperformed the B3LYP technique when they were mutually compared in our previous reported studies.16,17 The GHs are widely used to optimize the chemical structures and calculate the optoelectronic properties of organic materials.

Fig. 1 and 2 present the chemical structures of molecules considered in this study. Based on the number of fused rings in the electron-donating unit (D), FREAs are classified as tri, penta, hepta, and nonacyclic molecules in the literature.20 F(DPP)2B2,21 Flu-RH,22 and FRd223 are tricyclic FREAs with fluorene as their D core. Cz-RH22 and ITDI24 have carbazole and indenothiophene as D cores, respectively. The electron accepting units (A) in the tricyclic FREAs studied here mainly include diketopyrrolopyrrole, (dicyanomethylidene)-indan-1-one, and 3-ethylrhodanine. Most of the pentacyclic FREAs adopt indacenodithiophene as the D unit, such as IDT-BOC6,25 ATT-1,26 DC-IDT2T,27 IEICO,28 IEICO-4F,29 ATT-2,30 and ITOIC-2F.31 Cyanoindanone, 1,1-dicyanomethylene-3-indanone, and 2-(1,1-dicyanomethylene) rhodanine are the most commonly used A units in pentacyclic molecules.

Most of the heptacyclic compounds studied in this research are based on 1,1-dicyanomethylene-3-indanone as the A end-group and indacenodithieno[3,2-b]thiophene as the D core (Fig. 2).32–36 The nonacyclic molecules (Fig. 2) are composed of D cores of indacenobis(dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrol) and 6,6,12,12-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)indacenobis(dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]thiophene).37,38
The accurate modeling of optoelectronic properties using ab initio quantum chemistry methods is a vibrant determination of the researchers addressing the electronic structure theory.39 Numerous TD-DFT benchmark studies have compared the vertical excitation and 0–0 energies produced using DFT functionals with the experimentally measured data and the energies computed using correlated ab initio approaches. Dierksen and Grimme40 studied the excited-state geometries of biological chromophores and organic dyes using numerous functionals. The theoretical 0–0 energies indicated that the vibronic structure was rigorously governed by the HFX ratio in a hybrid functional. Nguyen and co-workers41 studied the vertical excited states of 7-aminocoumarins using the GHs and RSHs. They concluded that the former functionals provided more accurate results than the latter. Jacquemin and co-workers42 investigated the π to π* excitation of 15 dye molecules and found that the errors were extensive for RSHs but with smaller statistical dispersion, permitting additional expedient chemical intuitions. Jacquemin and co-workers43 also performed a TD-DFT study using different functionals and the Hartree–Fock theory for vertical absorption of more than 100 organic dyes. They found that PBE0 outperformed B3LYP and CAM-B3LYP with the smallest mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.14 eV. Leang and co-workers44 used 24 functionals to compute the transition energies of 14 small organic molecules. Compared to the experimental data, they found that the PBE0 and M06-2X methods had the lowest MAE of 0.28 eV and 0.26 eV, respectively. CAM-B3LYP gave a smaller MAE of 0.3 eV for singlet excited-states but a larger MAE of 1.1 eV for triplet excited-state transition energies. Isegawa and co-workers45 computed transition energies using 30 DFT functionals comprising mGGAs and RSHs. They found that the ωB97X-D and M06-2X methods produced the lowest MAE of 0.30 eV. The CAM-B3LYP method gave a MAE of 0.32 eV. Charaf-Eddin and co-workers46 reproduced the emission and absorption spectra of 20 representative conjugated molecules using six hybrid density functionals. They concluded that the B3LYP method had the minimum MAEs for the emission and absorption maxima. The M06-2X method gave more correct values of transition energy for challenging materials. Fang and co-workers47 used TD-DFT, second-order coupled cluster (CC2), and configuration interaction singles (CIS) to calculate the vertical, adiabatic, and 0–0 transition energies of a benchmark set of 79 molecules covering both organic and inorganic systems. The 0–0 energy values calculated with the CC2 level of theory were mostly found to be in agreement with the experimental ones. PBE0, ωB97X-D, B3LYP, CAMB3LYP, and M06-2X methods also produced values that mostly agreed with the experimental values, whereas higher MAEs were noticed with M06-HF, BP86, and CIS. Jacquemin and co-workers48 presented a study on the excited states of 80 medium and large conjugated molecules using five wave function approaches and TD-DFT. Suellen and co-workers49 presented an investigation into the 41 excited-states of organic molecules using wave function methods and TD-DFT. They concluded that TD-DFT was more accurate for the absorption energies as compared to the adiabatic and fluorescence energies. Shao and co-workers50 concluded in a recent study for biochromophores using TD-DFT that the vertical transition energies strongly depended on the amount of HFX in GHs.
In this report, we, for the first time, accurately evaluate the impact of the HFX on the TD-DFT performance when computing the vertical excited-state energies (Ever-theo) of a comprehensive set of 34 FREAs employing 16 GHs, including GGAs and mGGAs. As can be seen in Fig. 1 and 2, the major types of FREAs contain tri, penta, hepta, and nonacyclic fused-ring structures. The performances of the GHs for calculation of the excited-state energies can fluctuate in accordance with the benchmark set of molecules considered. For instance, in our previous TD-DFT benchmark study for a set of 50 FREAs, the B3LYP and PBE0 methods provided MAEs of 0.108 eV and 0.06 eV, respectively.18 In another study, we reported that on evaluating the nature of the vertical excited-states of a different set of 12 FREAs, the B3LYP and PBE0 methods produced MAEs of 0.06 eV and 0.05 eV, respectively.19 However, the benchmark set of 34 representative FREAs and 16 GH functionals fulfills the requirements to achieve the objectives of this study. The performance of the GHs was assessed using the conventional functionals before varying the HFX fraction to locate the optimal value. This study provides the performance of a wide range of GHs for the Ever-theo of large molecules. It also uncovers how the performance of a particular functional fluctuates with the molecular size changes and the customized optimal value of the HFX in the functional employed. This study paves the way for developing more efficient DFT functionals for larger organic molecules.
2 Theory and computational methodology
We aimed to evaluate the performance of the GH DFT functionals, including the GGAs and the mGGAs, with various HFX ratios in the TD-DFT framework for the vertical excited states of FREAs. The primary motivations for this research are twofold: (i) how the GH functionals used in this work ensure their relevance for calculating the Ever-theo of this efficient class of OPV materials, and (ii) what influences the HFX percentage has on their performance. The accuracy of the GH functionals for a specific property and material is related to the fraction of the non-local HFX. The local-spin-density gradient along with 20 to 25% HFX incorporated into the global hybrid GGA functionals for molecules corrects the significant over-binding given by the LSDA.51 The amount of HFX in the global hybrid GGAs intensely influences the Ever-theo.50,52 In our prior research work,18,19 the B3LYP13–15 method with a 20% HFX produced a larger mean signed error (MSE) and a MAE for Ever-theo values of FREAs, when compared with the PBE016,17 method with a 25% HFX. This indicates that the GH accuracy was related to the HFX ratio for the Ever-theo of FREAs, hence, the performance improves when PBE0 with a larger HFX percentage is employed. This motivated us to dig further into this relationship to find the GH with an optimal HFX ratio for the vertical excited states of FREAs. Hence, we picked a group of 16 distinct GHs with HFX ranging from 20% to 54% and a benchmark set of 34 representative FREAs. Table 1 lists all of the functionals along with their HFX percentages.

The GGA functionals depend on the local spin density and its gradient, and the mGGAs also depend on the local spin kinetic energy density. Global hybrid GGAs and mGGAs were designed by adding a fraction of non-local HFX in the exchange–correlation functionals. The functionals B3PW91,53 B3LYP,14,15,53 mPW3PBE,54 X3LYP,55 B971,56 B972,57 B98,58 APF,59 APFD,59 PBE0 (PBE1PBE),16,17 mPW1PW91,60 mPW1LYP,54 and mPW1PBE54 are global hybrid GGAs, whereas M0551 and M0661 are global hybrid mGGAs, as indicated in Table 1. M05 eliminates the self-correlation effects by balancing the kinetic-energy density in the exchange–correlation functionals. It is used in thermochemistry, thermochemical kinetics, organometallics, noncovalent interactions, and nonmetallic bonding. It achieves the uniform electron gas limit. The M06 functional is parameterized with improved accuracy for transition metals and non-metals. APFD comprises an empirical dispersion correction term for the dispersion interaction treatment.
In principle, theoretical 0–0 transition energies should be compared to the experimental 0–0 transition energies. Since there is no easy way to calculate the former for these large molecules and the latter are typically unavailable, the Ever-theo values are compared to the transition energies (Emax-exp) calculated from the experimental maximum wavelength (λmax) values. All molecular geometries already optimized using the PBE0 method and a double-ζ basis set 6-31G(d,p) are adopted from our previous work.18 The alkyl chains of all molecules have been simplified into methyl groups before optimization in order to save simulation time, which is the same strategy used in the literature with no change in the optical properties of molecules.48,62 The 6-31G(d,p) basis set is also used to do the excited-state calculations, as it produces the reliable electronic trends between the theoretically anticipated and the existing experimental data for the OSC.62–64 The PBE0 method is acknowledged as a reliable method for producing the optimized ground-state molecular geometries for most of the organic molecules.65–67 All of the TD-DFT computations are conducted using the Gaussian 09 software.68 Narsaria and co-workers69 found that the transition energies in solution predicted through TD-DFT were more systematic and accurate than those anticipated in the gas phase when the experimental transition energies measured in solution were available. The polar solvent chloroform helps to stabilize the increased dipole moment caused by the electronic transition from D to A in the excited state.70 Hence, all the TD-DFT simulations are only accomplished in chloroform, and the experimental λmax values recorded in the same solvent are taken from the literature. The polarizable continuum model (PCM)71 is a widely used model to account for solvent effects in the excited-state simulations of the OPV materials.48 Consequently, the solution cavity effects are taken into account using the PCM approach to give an actual TD-DFT performance for FREAs. The standard non-equilibrium TD-DFT protocol, specially developed for excited states, is nominated.72–75 The vibronic couplings are required for an ideal match between simulation and experimental spectra. The calculation of the Frank–Condon factors for molecules makes the perfect match possible between the simulation and the experimental results.76–78 However, this analysis is not computationally viable for such an extended set of large-size molecules. Hence, the vertical approximation is adopted in this study.
Simple linear regression analysis (LRA) is performed on the Ever-theo and λver-theo values obtained using TD-DFT. Correlations are developed between the experimental and TD-DFT data by obtaining the linear polynomials for all functionals. These polynomials are used to obtain the linearly-corrected Ever-theo and λver-theo values for the whole set of functionals. MAE and RMSE values are obtained from the linearly-corrected values of Ever-theo and λver-theo and experimental data. The MAE and RMSE values obtained using the TD-DFT actual data are, respectively, compared with those obtained from the linearly-corrected data.
A straight comparison of the computed Ever-theo values with the experimentally recorded spectrum is challenging. The spectrum peaks are widened by the vibrational and dynamical effects, mainly due to intensity scrounging for weak excitations. Hence, we adopt the standard conventional method to compare the values of Ever-theo to those of Emax-exp.50 The λver-theo values obtained through B3LYP and PBE0 are taken from our previous study.18 To evaluate the TD-DFT performance for regenerating the experimental UV-visible spectra of 34 FREAs using all 15 GH functionals, the determination coefficient (R2), MAE, MSE, and the root-mean-square error (RMSE) are computed from the experimental data and compared. The Ever-theo values for all molecules are calculated with various HFX ratios in an individual functional to understand the impact of HFX on the excitation energies.
To uncover the effect of HFX in GH functionals for through-space charge transfer (CT), we qualitatively calculate the CT magnitude for a subset of 10 representative FREAs using Le Bahers’ approach.79,80 This method is based on the computed electron density difference between the ground and excited states of push–pull molecules. It permits description of the spatial extent and electron transferred fraction associated to a given charge transfer transition. It is based on the definition of centroids of charges associated to the electronic-density rise and reduction regions upon transition. It gives a qualitative and easy way to visualize the measure of the spatial extent of the acceptor and the donor units of a molecule. An index is developed that allows defining the presence of eventually pathologic CT excitations for TD-DFT treatment in combination with GGA or GH functionals. Three functionals with an HFX amount of 20, 23, and 25% are selected for the as-mentioned purpose. The amount of CT for 10 FREAs is computed using APF, and the CT values given by PBE0 and B3LYP are taken from previous research.18 The electronic density maps are also obtained for PBE0 and B3LYP.
3 Results and discussion

Table 2 compares the calculated Ever-theo values of all FREAs using B3LYP, X3LYP, B98, APF, APFD, PBE0, M06, M05, and M06-2X to their experimental Emax-exp values. Table S1 (ESI†) displays the same assessment for the whole set of molecules using B3PW91, mPW3PBE, B971, B972, mPW1PW91, mPW1LYP, and mPW1PBE. Tables S2 and S3 (ESI†) present the comparison of the vertical absorption wavelengths (λver-theo) with the experimental λmax for all functionals. The Ever-theo values computed using the GHs containing 20–28% HFX are plotted against those of the Emax-exp as shown in Fig. 3. The results for the non-corrected theoretical data are presented in Table 3. Table 4 shows the findings obtained by applying the LRA on the TD-DFT data. For the typical GHs, the plot in Fig. 6 shows the comparison between the values of MAE and RMSE obtained from the TD-DFT and linearly-corrected data. The errors for each individual molecule obtained by subtracting the Ever-theo from the Emax-exp are provided in Tables S4 and S5 (ESI†). The Ever-theo values for all molecules calculated with various HFX ratios in an individual functional are given in Tables S7–S21 (see in the ESI†), while the TD-DFT and statistically corrected results obtained through LRA are also provided in Tables S22–S27 (ESI†). The Ever-theo values for the best performing HFX ratios in the GHs are plotted against those of the Emax-exp as shown in Fig. S2–S4 (ESI†). The plots in Fig. 5 and Fig. S5 (ESI†) provide the comparison between the values of the MSE and MAE obtained from the TD-DFT data computed using the GHs containing the excellent performing HFX ratios. For simplicity, we first discuss the results of the standard functionals containing the lower HFX ratios, following those with higher ones and then pinpointing the best performing HFX ratio in GHs for the excited states of FREAs.

3.1 Comparison with experimental data
The λver-theo and Ever-theo values of 34 FREAs obtained by employing B3LYP, B3PW91, and mPW3PBE agree with the experimental data (Fig. 3, Table 2 and Tables S1, S2, ESI†). These functionals almost give similar results for the whole set of molecules, with slight deviations for B3LYP compared with the results presented for the other two methods. These methods have a non-local HFX of 20%. Compared to B3PW91 and mPW3PBE, the largest variation in the whole set of FREAs is 9 nm for IPIC-4Cl with B3LYP (Table S2, ESI†). To know the performance of the B3LYP method for FREAs in detail, one can read our previous study.18,19 The other two functionals behave similarly to the B3LYP method, although with somewhat smaller λver-theo values for all molecules. It might be explained by the fact that all three GHs have the same HFX ratio. The B3PW91 and mPW3PBE methods almost give identical values of λver-theo for all the molecules. In general, the λver-theo value for an individual compound shows a smaller deviation from the experimental λmax value. For instance, B3LYP gives a maximum absolute deviation of 78 nm for FRd2, whereas B3PW91 and mPW3PBE yield 75 nm for the same molecule. It demonstrates that the magnitudes of the deviations given by B3LYP, B3PW91, and mPW3PBE follow a similar trend for an individual compound.
B3PW91 and mPW3PBE give equal MSE, MAE, and RMSE, which are 0.07, 0.09, and 0.11 eV, respectively (Table 3). The corresponding values for B3LYP are 0.08, 0.09, and 0.12 eV, as shown in Table 3. It shows that giving the same MAE, the three methods with the same HFX fraction exhibit equal performance. Against the same λmax value (500 nm), each functional gives a larger value of λver-theo for Flu-RH than that for CzRH (Tables S2 and S3, ESI†).
The Ever-theo values calculated using X3LYP, B971, B972 and B98 (first three with 21% HFX and B98 with 22% HFX) for any individual molecule are larger than those given by any of the methods of B3LYP, B3PW91 and mPW3PBE (Table 2 and Table S1, ESI†). This means that for FREAs, the Ever-theo values obtained with the GHs usually follow the trend of a larger HFX ratio producing larger Ever-theo values (smaller λver-theo values). However, the tendency among some GHs is sometimes an exception. For instance, the Ever-theo values for Cz-RH computed through B3LYP, B3PW91, and mPW3PBE are 2.27, 2.28, and 2.28 eV, respectively. It increases to 2.30 eV for X3LYP and B971 and 2.31 eV for B972. Despite having a larger HFX ratio of 22%, the B98 method gives a smaller Ever-theo value of 2.29 eV when compared with GHs comprising 21% HFX (Table 2 and Table S1, ESI†).
The MSEs obtained through X3LYP, B971, B972, and B98 are 0.05, 0.06, 0.05, and 0.04 eV, respectively, and the corresponding MAEs are 0.07, 0.08, 0.07, and 0.07 eV (Table 3). The lower MAE values indicate that these four hybrid methods show better performance than B3LYP, B3PW91, and mPW3PBE. The Ever-theo values for an individual molecule and the MAEs and MSEs for the whole set show that the X3LYP and B972 methods perform nicely and give the same results. The maximum absolute deviation for all four methods is not more than 71 nm (for B971 in Table S2, ESI†). In comparison, B98 offers remarkably less deviation (MSE and MAE of 0.04 and 0.07 eV, respectively) for the current set of FREAs. The MSE provided by B98 is half that of B3LYP, and the same improvement in MAE (in eV) given by B98 is 22%. The 2% increase in the HFX amount from B3LYP to B98 delivers a considerable improvement in the TD-DFT performance for FREAs. X3LYP and B972 systematically produce smaller errors for most of the molecules compared to those given by the B971 and B98 methods, as presented in Table S4 (ESI†). The APF functional is an optimized combination of 58.9% PBE0 (PBE1PBE) and 41.1% B3PW91 that efficiently eradicates all spurious interactions, i.e., the long-range repulsive or attractive interactions found in most of the DFT models.
It serves as a solid foundation for adding an empirical dispersion correction term derived from a spherical atom model to form APFD. APF and its APFD variant have an HFX of 23%. Both of them generate equal Ever-theo values for each of the FREAs and hence exhibit unerringly the same and exceptional prediction performance across all the methods evaluated in this study. For simplicity, we will refer to APF throughout the text, and the conclusions are the same for APFD.

Table 2 and Table S3 (ESI†) show the highest agreement between the theoretical and experimental data for APF. The deviations are smallest (i.e., −0.02, 0, or 0.02 eV) for ITOIC-F, ITOIC-2F, m-ITIC, IT-DM, IT-M, ITCPTC, ITIC2, INIC, INIC2, INIC1, and INIC3 (Table S5, ESI†). INIC1, INIC2, and INIC3 are made by fluorinating their electron deficient end-group A, which drops the LUMO energy level and promotes electron mobility by red-shifting the absorption spectra.37 This red-shift is nicely shown by APF when going from INIC to any of its derivatives. The larger negative error depicts that APF overestimates the Ever-theo values of IPIC, IPIC-4F, and IPIC-4Cl (Table S5, ESI†). Yet, it predicts the red-shift when we move from IPIC to its derivatives via fluorination or chlorination (Table S3, ESI†). The excellent performance of the two functionals implies that 23% is an optimal performing HFX ratio in the GH GGAs for calculating the Ever-theo of FREAs. A vigilant analysis of the errors (Tables S4 and S5, ESI†) reveals that the deviations shift from positive to negative for most molecules going from B98 to APF. As shown in Table 3, the MSE and MAE for APF are 0.02 and 0.06 eV, respectively. The MSE achieved in nm (i.e., 21 nm) using APF is the lowest of the MSEs computed here (Table 3). Except for the RMSE in nm provided by mPW1LYP (28 nm), the MSE (−4 nm), MAE (21 nm), and the RMSE (28 nm) produced by APF from the values of λver-theo and λmax are also the least of any MSE, MAE and RMSE generated by other rivals. These results confirm that the optimal HFX percentage for predicting the excited-state energies of the FREAs is 23%. Hence, APF is the most efficient functional for the present set of FREAs and may be used to evaluate the nature of the excited states of new FREAs for high-performance OSCs.
Moving on to the functionals containing higher percentages of HFX, mPW1LYP performs somewhat better than PBE0, mPW1PW91, and mPW1PBE in terms of MSE and MAE (Table 3). They all have an equal percentage of HFX, i.e., 25%. The MSE values for PBE0, mPW1PW91, mPW1LYP, and mPW1PBE are −0.02, −0.02, −0.004, and −0.02 eV, respectively. And the corresponding MAE values are 0.07, 0.06, 0.06, and 0.07 eV, respectively (Table 3). The sign of the MSEs shows that the increased HFX in the functionals overcorrects the underestimated values of Ever-theo obtained at the levels of B3LYP, B3PW91, mPW3PBE, X3LYP, B971, B972, and B98 relative to the Emax-exp values. Hence, the GH GGAs with 25% HFX tend to overestimate the Ever-theo magnitudes of the FREAs relative to Emax-exp values.
The M05, M06, and M06-2X functionals are GH mGGAs that depend on the local-spin-density gradient and the local spin kinetic energy density. M06-2X exhibits the highest amount of HFX amongst all the functionals considered in this study. It gives the largest MSE (−0.35), MAE (0.35), and RMSE (0.36) amongst all the values of MSE, MAE, and RMSE produced here (Table 3). M05 yields a sizable MSE, which is analogous to B3LYP but with the reverse sign. As shown in Table 3 and Fig. 3, the M05 method provides the second largest MAE (0.10 eV) but with a good R2 value. Consequently, the M06-2X and M05 methods perform poorly compared to the other GH functionals. The M06 method has a lower MSE of −0.03 eV and an MAE of 0.07 eV (Table 3). It provides a higher correlation coefficient as can be seen in Fig. 3. Hence, the M06 method outperforms the M05 and M06-2X methods. M05 and M06 produce larger errors for the tricyclic compounds than for others (see Table S5 in the ESI†). This implies that as molecules get larger, positive errors become smaller and switch to negative ones. This switching indicates that underestimation for small molecules transforms to overestimation for larger molecules (Table S5, ESI†). For hepta and nonacyclic FREAs, the M05 method produces negative deviations larger than those of M06 (Table S5, ESI†), indicating that M06 is more efficient for smaller band-gap FREAs. M06 has bigger positive and smaller negative deviations for the whole set of FREAs, whereas M05 does the opposite. The plots presented in Fig. 3 compare the Ever-theo values against the Emax-exp values for all functionals, which show a good agreement between the experimental and TD-DFT data. The λver-theo values of all compounds using the entire set of GHs strictly obey the inverse proportionality with HFX percentage, as shown in Tables S2 and S3 (ESI†). This conclusion is consistent with the investigations of the excitation energies of FREAs and other organic compounds that use global and range-separated hybrids.18,19,43 For tricyclic molecules, each functional yields Ever-theo values that are lower than the experimental ones, resulting in larger and positive errors (Tables S4 and S5 in the ESI†). Larger molecules, such as penta, hepta, and nonacyclic molecules, follow a different pattern. All the errors for M06-2X are negative in sign, showing that it overestimates the excitation energies for all FREAs (Table S5, ESI†). The deviations in Tables S4 and S5 (ESI†) demonstrate that the functionals with the lowest and highest HFX percentages do not follow a similar trend.
Lower HFX percentages (B3LYP, B3PW91, mPW3PBE, X3LYP, B971, B972, and B98) produce positive errors for most penta, hepta, and nonacyclic compounds but negative deviations for a few as shown in Tables S4 and S5 (ESI†). Higher HFX percentages (PBE0, mPW1PW91, mPW1LYP, mPW1PBE, M05, and M06) result in negative errors for half of the pentacyclic FREAs and nearly all of the hepta and nonacyclic FREAs (Tables S4 and S5, ESI†). The highest HFX percentage (M06-2X) provides negative errors for all FREAs (Tables S4 and S5, ESI†). When we move from the lower to the higher HFX percentages, the deviation typically moves from less negative to more negative for a certain molecule (left to right in Tables S4 and S5 in the ESI†). For instance, the deviation for INIC is 0.07 eV with B3LYP, 0 eV with APF, and −0.1 eV with M05. This shows that the excited states in FREAs are very sensitive to the HFX ratio. APF acts between the largest and lowest HFX percentages. It decreases the MAE by a factor of 1.5 when compared to B3PW91, B3LYP, and mPW3PBE, and by a factor of 1.7 when compared to M05 (considering the MAE values in eV in Table 3). To put it another way, it regulates the underestimation and the overestimation simultaneously. The calculations also indicate that the APF functional not only reduces the systematic errors produced by other GH GGAs and GH mGGAs but also improves the RMSE deviations of the benchmarking set, which are 0.12 eV (B3LYP) > 0.11 eV (B3PW91, mPW3PBE, and M05) > 0.10 eV (X3LYP, B971, and B972) > 0.09 eV (B98 and M06) > 0.08 eV (APF, PBE0, mPW1PW91, mPW1LYP, and mPW1PBE). The mPW1LYP functional is approximately as efficient as APF but with the opposite sign of the MSE.
More positively, all fifteen functionals show statistically significant R2 values (Fig. 3). It is also worth mentioning that all functionals can accurately anticipate the red-shift in the absorption spectra in some cases. For instance, all the methods work pretty well for the red-shift in the λver-theo value in response to the fluorine atom being attached to the A unit of IEICO to form IEICO-4F (Tables S2 and S3, ESI†).
All the GHs perform well in anticipating the red-shift in the case of ITIC-Cl and ITIC-Br as can be seen in Tables S2 and S3 (ESI†). Following the same trend, almost all the GHs do not produce the λver-theo and Ever-theo values according to the ascending or descending order existing in two or more experimental values from top to bottom in Table 2 and Tables S1–S3 (ESI†).
Following excitation, the first excited state includes a substantial reconfiguration of the electronic density of the molecule, displaying a depletion of the density on the D core and augmentation on the A ends. We qualitatively analyzed the intra-molecular CT magnitude for a representative set of 10 FREAs using Le Bahers’80,87 technique and the ground and excited-state densities generated by APF, PBE0, and B3LYP. The set of 10 representative FREAs includes molecules from each type of FREA considered in this study to know how the qualitative CT changes when a functional with different HFX is used. Regarding the nature of the excited states and intramolecular charge transfer of FREAs, we have already studied19 the first ten excited states of each FREA in a benchmark set of 12 different molecules. The findings for the first excited state of 10 FREAs here in this work are consistent with our already reported conclusions. To highlight the influence of the HFX and the performance of APF for CT from D to A, the CT values provided by APF were compared to those provided by B3LYP and PBE0. APF, B3LYP, and PBE0 were used to create electronic density difference plots (Fig. 4) to study how the electronic density transfer from D to A of these FREAs is imitated. The CT values computed with B3LYP, PBE0, and APF are shown in Table S6 (ESI†). CT values for PBE0 and B3LYP were derived from earlier research.18 The CT strength obeys the order PBE0 > APF > B3LYP, which is the same as that followed by the Ever-theo values. A functional with the higher HFX shows more CT strength (Table S6, ESI†). The intense electronic density regions (green in Fig. 4 and Fig. S1, ESI†) are more localized on the A groups. In contrast, the density reduction areas (red in Fig. 4 and Fig. S1, ESI†) are typically found on the D unit. All the density difference maps obtained through APF, B3LYP, and PBE0 illustrate the correct directionality for the electron density of all compounds.

To dig deeper into the effect of HFX on Ever-theo of FREAs, we changed the percent amount of HFX in each of the GHs and employed the new versions on all FREAs. The results obtained with various modified HFX ratios for all functionals are given in Tables S7–S21 (ESI†). The plots presented in Fig. S2–S4 (ESI†) compare the Ever-theo values against the Emax-exp for the best performing ratios in all functionals, which show a good agreement between the theoretical and experimental data. The value of λver-theo for a specific substance systematically decreases with a gradual increase in the HFX ratio for all GH functionals, as shown in Tables S7–S21 (ESI†). For instance, B3LYP gives a 660 nm value of λver-theo for F(DPP)2B2, whereas the value reduces to 630 nm when B3LYP-25HFX with 25% HFX is applied. The lowest MSE and MAE values are obtained with B3LYP-23HFX, B3LYP-24HFX, and B3LYP-25HFX with 23, 24, 25% HFX, respectively (Table S22, ESI†). The value of MAE for B3LYP-23HFX, B3LYP-24HFX, and B3LYP-25HFX is 0.06 eV. The lowest MAE of 0.06 eV is obtained using B3PW91-23HFX, B3PW91-24HFX, B3PW91-25HFX, mPW3PBE-23HFX, mPW3PBE-24HFX, and mPW3PBE-25HFX (Table S22, ESI†). Statistical analysis for each functional shows that the optimal values of HFX are 23% to 25% (Tables S22–S27, ESI†). The sign of the MSE (in nm) deviation changes from lowest negative to lowest positive when HFX changes from 23% to 24%, such as in the case of B3PW91-23HFX, B3PW91-24HFX, mPW3PBE-23HFX, mPW3PBE-24HFX, B971-23HFX, B971-24HFX, B972-23HFX, and B972-24HFX (Fig. 5 and Fig. S5, Tables S22, S23, ESI†). These conclusions show that the Ever-theo values of the FREAs strictly depend on the HFX ratio in the GH functional. All the new versions of the GHs provide high R2 values as shown in respective plots in Fig. S2–S4 (ESI†).

3.2 Calibration of theoretical data
A correlation in theoretical and experimental data is used to correct the λver-theo and Ever-theo values using the LRA and linear fitting. In this regard, corrected data were generated using the LRA and linear fitting of Ever-theo with the Emax-exp. The results for corrected theoretical data are plotted in Fig. 6. The LRA entails calculating a linear polynomial to find the best match between the theoretical and experimental data. Table 4 shows the statistical analysis of the linearly-corrected data for the whole set of functionals. The MSEs and MAEs calculated from the corrected data improve considerably compared with the TD-DFT data, especially for the functionals showing larger deviations from the experimental data. This is a direct outcome of the GHs already having a higher R2 value between the TD-DFT and the experimental results, and the fit efficiently tends to reduce the systemic error. As demonstrated in Fig. 3, the R2 value achieved using GHs is at least 0.88 (for M05), showing the importance of these functionals for the excited-state analysis of FREAs. B3LYP has an MAE and an RMSE of 0.06 and 0.08 eV, respectively (Fig. 6) obtained from the experimental and linearly-corrected data. Similarly, the rectified results of B3PW91, mPW3PBE, and M05 demonstrate their importance in predicting FREA transition energies.
 Fig. 6  Comparison between MAEs and RMSEs (in eV) obtained from unmodified data calculated with PCM-TD/6-31G(d,p) using the functionals containing 20–28% Hartree–Fock exact exchange, and the MAE and the RMSE obtained from linearly corrected data for each functional. 
The MAE (in eV) indicates a 33% improvement over the raw errors for B3LYP, B3PW91, and mPW3PBE, 25% for B971, and 14% for X3LYP, B972, B98, PBE0, mPW1PBE, and M06. Applying LRA to MAEs generated by APF, APFD, mPW1PW91, and mPW1LYP does not show improvement, and the corrected data are entirely consistent with the experimental data. The RMSE gives a 33% improvement for B3LYP and M06, 27% for B3PW91 and mPW3PBE, 20% for B971, B972, and X3LYP, 11% for B98, 25% for APF, APFD, PBE0, mPW1PW91, mPW1LYP, and mPW1PBE, and 45% for M05 over their RMSE values calculated from the raw data produced by TD-DFT. As a result, LRA improves the TD-DFT raw data significantly and provides sufficient accuracy for the prediction of FREA transition energies, as also seen in Tables S22–S27 in the ESI.†
4 Conclusions
We investigated the impact of the Hartree–Fock exact exchange (HFX) on the performance of global hybrid (GH) functionals using TD-DFT for computing the vertical excitation energies (Ever-theo) of A–D–A structured fused-ring electron acceptors (FREAs). The computed Ever-theo values strictly follow a direct proportionality to the HFX fraction. The performance of the GHs with the same HFX ratio is almost identical. All three methods i.e., B3LYP, B3PW91, and mPW3PBE with 20% HFX provide a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.09 eV. The performance improves with 21% HFX ratio in X3LYP, B971, and B972, and 22% in B98 giving 0.07, 0.08, 0.07, and 0.07 MAE values, respectively. For the benchmark set of FREAs, the APF and APFD with 23% HFX give the smallest deviations, with the MSE and MAE limited to 0.02 eV and 0.06 eV, respectively. The APF and APFD tend to control the overestimation and the underestimation of the excitation energies. The performance drops with M06 and M05 with higher HFX ratios of 27 and 28%, respectively. M06 and M05 provide MAEs of 0.07 and 0.10 eV, respectively. M06-2X with 54% HFX provides the largest MAE value of 0.35 eV.
By varying the HFX ratio, the smallest MAE value of 0.06 eV was obtained at 23 to 25% HFX fraction in most of the GH functionals considered in this study. This suggests that 23, 24, and 25% HFX ratios are the optimal values for the best prediction of the FREA excitation energies. It is also found that the GHs seem to be more efficient for the larger-sized FREAs with smaller Ever-theo values, applying the vertical approximation. This research can provide accurate assessments of the excitation energies for new FREA designs for organic solar cells.
